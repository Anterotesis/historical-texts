<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF FINANCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the cau&s;es of the depreciation of the Bills of Credit emitted by Congre&s;s are briefly &s;tated and examined, and a Plan propo&s;ed for re&s;toring Money to a certain, known value.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of finance &s;eems to be &s;o little under&s;tood in America, that we find almo&s;t as many opinions as there are men who undertake to rea&s;on upon it &s;y&s;|tematically, e&s;pecially upon the large &s;cale upon which it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary now to take it up. But it is a &s;ubject in which we are all deeply intere&s;ted, and our affairs, though in other re&s;pects they are in as pro&s;perous a condition as we could have expected, have run &s;o extremely wild in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that every one perceives we have &s;trayed from the proper road, and &s;eems anxiou&s;ly inqui&s;itive how to recover it again.</P>
<P>The rapacious violence of the Briti&s;h Court threw us &s;uddenly into one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;ituations imaginable. On the one hand we &s;aw nothing but the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, from which the minds of a people accu&s;tomed to think them&s;elves free, would re|volt, if they had no other a&s;ylum than death: On the the other, a mazy wilderne&s;s of inexplicable difficulties. In this &s;ituation, &s;urrounded with dangers and impelled by nece&s;&s;ity to immediate action, we were driven to adopt expedients from time to time on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pur of occa&s;ion, tru&s;ting to future events for an opportunity of method<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zing our affairs and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucing them to order. The grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of war is money. We were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o organized as to be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o collect it with proyer expedition, nor in &s;ufficient quantity by taxes or other contributions; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to procure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;ome other way; and bills of credit were i&s;&s;ued on the faith of the people. While the quantity was within proper bounds,
<PB N="2" REF="016247_0002_0F9BD0104F4EDE78">the united zeal of the whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and their univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;|&s;ity of the mea&s;ure, gave the&s;e bills a ready currency (though they were in effect unfunded) in op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ition to all the arts and practices of the doubtful, the tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and the di&s;affected among us.

Thou|&s;ands among the mo&s;t worthy part of the community, who, either by their own ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;try or that of their ance&s;tors, have acquired what they fondly hoped would have &s;upported them&s;elves and their families in affluence, or a decent mediocrity, &s;ee their faire&s;t hopes on the brink of de&s;truction, and find them&s;elves within a &s;tep of the mo&s;t wretched poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. This &s;ituation mu&s;t be the more mortifying to many of them as, through zeal in the common cau&s;e of America, and confidence in the conductors of our public affairs, they have brought them&s;elves into it by ri&s;king their all upon the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cce&s;s of the revolution, and the wi&s;dom and good management of tho&s;e to who&s;e guidance it was committed; while others indifferent to the public good, or perhaps unfriendly to the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erprize have taken advantage of the national c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to enrich them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t to &s;ecure a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uation of compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ety, by what they call realizing; that is, by engr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing lands and other &s;olid property.

<P>In order to know what will be the proper remedy and how to ap|ply it to adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nece <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary to enquire as minutely as po&s;&s;ible into the nature, degree, and cau&s;es of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>By the nature and degree of the di&s;order, I mean th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> preciation of our currency, the quantity of that depre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iation and the effect it
<PB N="3" REF="016247_0003_0F9BD01299150158">has on our public affairs and our commerce, external and internal. The&s;e will be inciden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally con&s;idered in examining the cau&s;es of the depreciation, which I &s;hall arrange under the following heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. The exce&s;s of the quantity of money in circulation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Its not being e&s;tabli&s;hed on proper funds to be redeemed at certain periods, and</P>
<P N="3">3. The want of a proper plan for rai&s;ing future &s;upplies for car|ry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the war, without increa&s;ing the quantity of money in cir|culation.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t as to the exce&s;s of quantity. It &s;eems not to be a&s;cer|tained what quantity of money the commerce of the United States would bear in circulation, without occa&s;ioning any depreciation, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be well funded and in full credit as to the time and manner of its redemption; but the general<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of opinions fix it at not more than thirty nor le&s;s than twenty millions of dollars. I &s;hall take the medium and &s;uppo&s;e it to be twenty five millions. It is doubted by to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e whether the purcha&s;es made by the public are equal to the diminution of commerce occa&s;ioned by the war, I am inclined to think they are; and that, if the money for public expenditures came into the trea&s;ury in the cour&s;e of circulation, that is, by taxes and loans, the&s;e urchates would &s;upply the de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iences of commerce &s;o far as relates to the quantity of money requ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ite for a circulating medium. Hitherto money cannot be &s;aid to have had a fair circulation; for almo&s;t all the money expended by the public has been created and i&s;&s;ued as occa&s;ion required, without ever returning again into the public trea&s;ury. But as the creation of money is to cea&s;e, and it will in future travel its full round in circulation, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that commerce would find full employ for the u&s;ual quantity&mdash;&s;ay twenty five millions of dollars. The quantity now in circulation is is about one hundred and &s;ixty mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and if the depreciation is to be computed in mathematical proportion to the exce&s;s of the quantity, it &s;hould at this rate be but latle more than &s;ix for one. This mode of com|puting, however, is not always ju&s;t, e&s;pecially while the exce&s;s is increa&s;ing: but this will be con&s;idered under another head in ex|amining the imaginary cau&s;es of depreciation: I here &s;peak mere|ly of the natural cau&s;e.&mdash;exce&s;s of quantity. We have the a&s;&s;ur|ance of Congre&s;s that the quantity &s;hall not ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed two hundred millions of dollars; and though I hope they will not have occa&s;ion to go &s;o far as that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, yet, as it MAY happen, it may be fair to calculate upon it: the exce&s;s we may &s;uppo&s;e will then be as eight for one. This I call the natural cau&s;e of depreciation; the cau&s;es which follow I &s;hall for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction call imaginary.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cau&s;e of the great depreciation of money is its not being e&s;tabli&s;hed on proper funds to be redeemed at certain periods.</P>
<P>The money has been i&s;&s;ued on the mere authority of Congre&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="016247_0004_0F9BD012CDB08440">who it is &s;uppo&s;ed have not in them&s;elves the power of redeeming a &s;ingle dollar of it. I do not mean to call in que&s;tion the authority of Congre&s;s to emit money, nor the propriety of their doing it. The circum&s;tances of the occa&s;ion will probably ju&s;tify it, and their con&s;tituents in the &s;everal States have, by le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;lative acts, im|pliedly approved it; but they have not yet by direct and open acts a&s;&s;umed the redemption of it. That certainty which is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, and which the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s requires, has not therefore been given; and to this want of certainty much of the pre&s;ent extravagant degree of depreciation may be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted.</P>
<P>A third cau&s;e of the depreciation is the want of a proper plan for rai&s;ing future &s;upplies to carry on the war without increa&s;ing the quantity of money in circulation.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to declare that they will not on any account extend their bills of credit to more than two hundred mil|lions of dollars, and it is not doubted but that they mean to be go|verned by their promi&s;e. But we know that the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r is not yet at an end; that large &s;upplies of money will be nece&s;&s;ary; that the remaining forty millions which they re&s;erve the liberty of emitting mu&s;t &s;hortly be expended, unle&s;s aided by other means; that taxes will not afford &s;ufficient aid in due &s;ea&s;on; and that there does not appear that willingne&s;s in the money-holders to lend, on the pro|&s;ent footing, which is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ure a &s;ufficient quantity: Neither does it appear that the Loan-officers are authorized to re|ceive the nece&s;&s;ary quantity if it &s;hould be offered. How then is the trea&s;ury to be fami&s;hed? Congre&s;s, it is true have been plea&s;ed al&s;o to declare that <Q>further ways and means of providing for the public exigences are now under con&s;ideration, and will &s;oon be laid before their con&s;tituents.</Q> But what the&s;e ways and means are, when they will appear, and how far they will be effectual, are yet unknown to the public.</P>
<P>Some effectual mea&s;ures have long been expected, and we have been told for many months pa&s;t that &s;uch mea&s;ures have been under the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s. When this expectation commenced, the whole amount of the depreciation of money, natural and arti|ficial, was but four or five for one of &s;terling. It is now &mdash;I dare not &s;ay how much. Has it kept pace with the quantities emit|ted &s;ince that time? It has abundently out run that proportion. Have our external affairs grown wor&s;e in the mean time? On the contrary they have flouri&s;hed even beyond our hopes. What then can have occa&s;ioned this dreadful panic&mdash;this di&s;tru&s;t of our&s;elves which is driving us headlong to the brink of a dangerous preci|pice? What have we to fear? The circum&s;tances of our exhau&s;t|ed enemy render them le&s;s an object of terror than of the &s;ofter e|motions of humanity; and Providence has rai&s;ed us up friends, and &s;trengthened our hands in a manner that gives us the faire&s;t pro&s;|pect
<PB N="5" REF="016247_0005_0F9BD0135DC02E30">of &s;eeing our independency e&s;tabli&s;hed on as firm a ba&s;is as human affairs admit of, and of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of PEACE, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TY AND SAFETY. Does not all this plainly indicate &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al mi&s;conduct in the management of our affairs? We all know that &s;chemes of finance are a delicate &s;ubject, and that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es are &s;o particularly circum&s;tanced, and in &s;o tickli&s;h a &s;itu|ation that they will no looger bear either delay or doubtful experi|ments. Mea&s;ures that, co-operating with others in a general &s;y&s;|tem, might be very u&s;eful and proper, often prove mi&s;chievous when put in practice &s;eparately. I need produce no other proof of this than the &s;cheme of calling in the emi&s;&s;ions of May 1777, and April 1778. May we not with propriety, re&s;pecting our fi|nances, &s;ay that, by leaving undone tho&s;e things which we ought to have done, and by doing tho&s;e things which we ought not to have done, that faith which is the evidence of things not &s;een hath lo&s;t us due influence, and there is no health in that confidence which is nece&s;&s;ary to give due vigor to public mea&s;ures?</P>
<P>Hitherto we have con&s;idered the grand leading cau&s;es of depre|ciation. Let us take a cur&s;ory view of &s;ome of the branches which have &s;prung from them. The&s;e are too numerous to be minutely con&s;idered in an e&s;&s;ay of this kind; and, viewed &s;eparately, they may appear of trifl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng con&s;equence; but their aggregate effect is wonderfully great. One of the large&s;t of the&s;e branches, which is again abundently ramified, is that intermediate traffic which has been &s;o much complained of as a pernicious evil, between the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of commodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, whether by importation, manufacture or otherwi&s;e, and the con&s;umer. This is in fact a natural effect of a continued cour&s;e of depreciation; but, like the acce&s;&s;ions of a &s;now-ball rolling down the &s;ide of a mountain, it increa&s;es the magnitude and velocity of its cau&s;e, and thus in turn it&s;elf becomes a cau&s;e. Much of this intermediate traffic is carried on merely for the &s;ake of private gain, regardle&s;s of other con&s;equences; but much is al&s;o done &s;olely to avoid lo&s;s. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt to enumerate the many arts and practices exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e who are engaged in this kind of trade, or the various motives which, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the times, induce &s;o many to become partakers in it: they are known to every intelligent ob&s;er|ver. Neither would I mention the general depravity of morals which at pre&s;ent &s;eems to prevail in commercial tran&s;actions, but for the &s;ake of introducing an ob&s;ervation in which I find I differ from many I conver&s;e with; and that is, that this depravity of morals ought to be con&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed as con&s;equent upon, rather than as the cau&s;e of the depreciation of money. As to the devices of the di&s;affected, and the doubts of the timid about the final event of our great &s;truggle, they have certainly had their &s;hare in ha&s;tening
<PB N="6" REF="016247_0006_0F9BD01416176158">on the depreciation, but they have &s;pent their force, and their in|fluence is become too contemptible to de&s;erve much ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e.</P>
<P>An idea has been &s;tarted, and &s;trongly u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged by an e&s;&s;ay writer who &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>a true Patriot,</HI> that nineteen twent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ths of the money ought to &s;ink in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nds of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. This for a time had a wonderful effect. It was &s;o plea&s;ing at fir&s;t view to tho&s;e who had le&s;s than their proportion of it in their hands, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with &s;o many advocates before they had time to reflect on the gro&s;s inju&s;tice of it, that it ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">med the great b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k of the people in the middle States with a &s;erious apprehen&s;ion that it would be put in practice. It operated like a report of a plague in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and in|duced many people to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n continental money as infectious, and to rid them&s;elves of what they had, on any terms, rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> keep it by them. I have been told of in&s;tances of the notes of private per&s;ons payable a few years hence, for le&s;s than a fourth of the va|lue and without any &s;tipulation for a particular kind of money, be|ing preferred to the full &s;um in ready money, on the &s;trength of this apprehen&s;ion only. And though thinking men may not per|haps have harboured an idea &s;o glaringly unju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, they have been carried on with the croud and obliged to give way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s force. Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;o di&s;honourable an idea could ever gain admittance in Congre&s;s? It &s;urely is not. But their long delay of the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to contradict it, let a &s;u&s;picion take place which &s;trength|ened the pernicious apprehen&s;ion, which has not yet cea&s;ed its ope|ration. The multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s they had before them, and the ob&s;tructions and difficulties they have met with on other &s;ub|jects were not known abroad, and this delay was not fairly ac|counted for.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the propriety of the ob&s;ervation above hinted, that the degree of depreciation of mo|ney, while it continues increa&s;ing, will always exceed the propor|tion of its exce&s;s in quantity. And I think it may be fairly infer|red that, as &s;oon as the quantity of money cea&s;es to increa&s;e, and what is in circulation &s;hall be properly funded &s;o as to give a rea|&s;onable &s;ecurity that it will be fairly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">edeemed at certain periods, the&s;e excre&s;&s;ent cau&s;es of depreciation will cea&s;e to operate, and money will &s;oon be liquidated at its true value in proportion to the quantity in circulation.</P>
<P>Before I &s;tate my own plan for effecting this de&s;irable purpo&s;e, I beg leave to offer a few thoughts on &s;ome of the propo&s;itions I have met with in reading and in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be generally agreed that our future &s;upplies mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by taxes and loans. The difficulty &s;eems to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in finding out in what way they are to be rai&s;ed by either or both of the&s;e means, in &s;ufficient quantity and in due &s;ea&s;on. Some are for re|lying on taxes alone; but this I fear would leave us in the lurch.
<PB N="7" REF="016247_0007_0F9BD014D2A331C8">We all know that taxes are the dermier re&s;ort, and that our public de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e di&s;charged principally by them: but nece&s;&s;ity has in|troduced the practice in all civilized countries, and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of exten&s;ive territory and inhabited by freemen, carrying on a war with money to the extent of their abilities, to anticipate their taxes by loans in &s;ome &s;hape or other. And I conceive it to be &s;o plainly impracticable for us in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums in due &s;ea&s;on by taxes only, that I &s;hall &s;pend no time in argument upon it.

<P>It has been propo&s;ed, and I am informed has obtained &s;erious con&s;ideration, that the di&s;terent States &s;hould be called upon for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pective quotas of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of money, to be paid in quarterly or monthly, leaving it to the re&s;pective Legi&s;la|tures to rai&s;e it by taxes, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oans, or both, as they plea&s;e. This &s;cheme, &s;o far as it can be effected by taxation, I take to be a good one; but taxation, like other good things, may be over&s;trained to the injury of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s future u&s;efulne&s;s; and, to whatever length it is carried for continental purpo&s;es, it ought to be kept as nearly e|qual as po&s;&s;ible in the different States. But of this I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter. As to loans I fear it is too late for this &s;cheme to take ef|fect. The difficulty lies in the uncertain value of money. If there was no con&s;iderable degree of depreciation, or if the depre|ciation was &s;ettled at any certain rate with a probability of its con|tinuing fixed for a cour&s;e of time, the different States might make loans on an equal footing and on terms of certainty; but in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things I do not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e how they can do it without playing a very high game of chances, in which the odds will be greatly again&s;t the State. Money is now at a rate of depreciation va&s;tly beyond what we may &s;uppo&s;e it will remain at when matters come to be explained, and the nece&s;&s;ary confidence in its final re|demption at a proper time again takes place. If then a State &s;hould borrow from an individual at this high rate, &s;ay twenty for one, and money &s;hould appreciate to ten for one at the time of repay|ment, would not the lender double his money? He is to receive the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me nominal &s;um that he lent, which is become of double the value. For a State to fix a certain rate of depreciation at which to borrow, will be attended wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h ri&s;k, becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry State, acting for it&s;elf, will probably differ from the re&s;t in fixing the rate; and whatever it may vary from the general rate which &s;hall prevail at the time of repaying the loan, will be either profit or lo&s;s to the State, and the rever&s;e to the lender, unle&s;s the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er be &s;ecured in
<PB N="8" REF="016247_0008_0F9BD01597C84D78">the contract again&s;t any chance but that of gain. So far as the re|&s;pective States may borrow for their own &s;eparate purpo&s;es, the&s;e chances are of le&s;s con&s;equence, becau&s;e as they lay out the mo|ney at its value at the time of borrowing, they reap the &s;ole bene|fit or di&s;advantage of its appreciation or depreciation, and gain in one way what they may lo&s;e in another; but if they turn the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|rowed money into the Continental <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;ury it is otherwi&s;e; the State runs the whole ri&s;k, and the Continent receives the money at a certainty, that is, its nominal value. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I do not think the States will &s;eparately contract loans for Continental pur|po&s;es, unle&s;s Congre&s;s &s;hall fix a rate by which they may do it on a plan of equality both as to the terms, and the quantity. Loans, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent fluctuating &s;tate of money, appear to be properly a Continental bu&s;ine&s;s, and the contracts &s;hould be imme|diately between Congre&s;s and the lender, which will pre&s;erve uni|formity in the plan, and equality in the chances of profit and lo&s;s to the different States, and thereby prevent tho&s;e new &s;cenes of job|bing and &s;peculation which would probably be con&s;equent upon loans on a great variety of terms, and which would hardly fail to create much jealou&s;y and di&s;content.</P>
<P>Some have propo&s;ed the levying in kind the articles wanted for public u&s;e. However plau&s;ible this may appear in theory, it would in my opinion mo&s;t certainly fail in practice. It may be likened to the laying a&s;ide a regular army, and depending &s;olely on the militia in monthly rotation to oppo&s;e the enemy. But &s;up|po&s;ing it to be in &s;ome degree practicable, it would, &s;o far as it went, de&s;troy that u&s;e for money on which its value in a great mea&s;ure depends, and render it more difficult to procure &s;uch ar|ticles as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be purcha&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>I have, moreover, heard it alledged that the bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;ts with the different States, and with the people at large, and that they do not manife&s;t a proper di&s;po&s;ition to exert them&s;elves. I am far from thinking this allegation well &s;ounded: I believe on the con|trary they are heartily di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary exertions if they were put in a way in which they might confidently &s;uppo&s;e they were acting in concert. But to what purpo&s;e are the exertions of individuals acting &s;eparately and unconn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">edly, and perhaps counteracting each other? How can it be expected they will act vigorou&s;ly under &s;uch di&s;couragements? And who can with pro|priety mark out the way in which their efforts &s;hall effectually tend to one point, but that body in whom the &s;overeignty of the whole is lodged? Congre&s;s, with re&s;pect to the United States, is as the Legi&s;lature of a particular State to the individuals of which it is compo&s;ed; and though they may not, perhaps, in all ca&s;es <HI>com|mand</HI> with the force of a law, they may <HI>recommend</HI> with &s;ufficient force to effect the purpo&s;e. Shall the bu&s;ine&s;s be delayed becau&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="016247_0009_0F9BD01651B5A930">the be&s;t mode po&s;&s;ible cannot be agreed upon? This, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would be like mariners di&s;puting which way they &s;hould &s;teer, and leaving the &s;ails flapping while the ve&s;&s;el is drifting on a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-&s;hore.

<P>One propo&s;ition more I beg leave to ob&s;erve upon; becau&s;e, however plau&s;ible and &s;pecious in appearance, I take it to be re|plete with a mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive poi&s;on, and extremely &s;alacious: I mean what comes under the idea that the public debt is di&s;charged, or dimini&s;hed <HI>pro tanto,</HI> by the depreciation of money operating as a tax on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, and on tho&s;e who have received and mu&s;t receive it in payment of debts? And is this an equal and ju&s;t tax? Let us enquire on whom, and in what proportion this tax falls. It will be found, &s;o far as it has yet ope|rated, to have fallen chiefly upon the <HI>aged,</HI> the <HI>infirm, widows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rphans, public in&s;titutions,</HI> the <HI>army, officers of government,</HI> and o|ther <HI>zealous actors in and &s;upporters of the revelation,</HI> many of whom are already reduced from ea&s;y, yea affluent circum&s;tances to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing poverty by the wonderful magic of this cunning mode of taxation; while a large proportion of tho&s;e who are to enjoy the benefit of the prize we are contending for, have &s;tudied to withhold both their property and their per&s;onal &s;ervices, and to keep them&s;elves uppormo&s;t on the wheel, turn which way it might. But this is not all; for in the end it will be found that the greater part of the profit of this inju&s;tice has redounded to crafty and en|terprizing individuals, many of whom have obtained it by means about as honourable as &s;ecreting their neighbours goods depo&s;ited in their cu&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in time of a fire, or concealing a pur&s;e accidentally found in the &s;treet. The public in fact have derived no benefit from it, and if it had, would any hone&s;t member of the commu|nity wi&s;h to be exempted from paying his proportion of taxes by &s;uch means? As well might he wi&s;h the army to levy its own &s;up|port from the unfortunate part of the country through which it might happen to pa&s;s. The &s;pecious &s;uppo&s;ition that the public debt is to be computed at the pre&s;ent rate of depreciation, or at whatever rate it may arrive at, is a mere delu&s;ion. It appears to me clearly that whatever ground we have pa&s;&s;ed over in the cour&s;e of depreciation, mu&s;t at &s;ome time and in &s;ome &s;hape or other, be retrodden in a cour&s;e of appreciation, that is, in di&s;charging the public debt; for, as the quantity is dimini&s;hed, the re&s;idue will ri&s;e in weight as long as any depreciation remains. The great mi&s;|fortune to tho&s;e who have been the mo&s;t &s;everely oppre&s;&s;ed by the depreciation is, that they will not in turn be peculiarly benefited by the appreciation: their private lo&s;&s;es have become the private
<PB N="10" REF="016247_0010_0F9BD01710A707F0">gain of other individuals who can be no otherwi&s;e reached by gene|ral laws than as their extraordinary wealth makes them greater ob|jects of taxation; and therefore if any relief is given to private &s;ufferers, it mu&s;t be by &s;pecial acts, and not by general regulations.</P>
<P>If the&s;e ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, it is clear that the public have not been benefited by the depreciation of the money; and I think it &s;till more clear that all the debt created at a depreciation beyond the natural degree ari&s;ing from the exce&s;s of quantity of the money in circulation, mu&s;t be contracted at a di&s;advantage to the public. Whenever depreciation cea&s;es its progre&s;&s;ive motion, tho&s;e imagi|nary cau&s;es, which have &s;welled it to its pre&s;ent enormous &s;ize, will &s;ub&s;ide, and, like a river which hath been &s;welled by exce&s;&s;ive rain, it will retire within its proper banks and be redu|ced to us natural &s;ize; and con&s;equently all the debt mu&s;t be paid off in the different gradations from that mark to the original value, that is, an equality with gold and &s;ilver. It may be &s;aid that, by means of a bank in Europe, a deep &s;troke may be made in the public debt at the pre&s;ent rate of depreciation. This I would readily admit if we had now &s;uch a bank exi&s;ting: But I know of no other way to create it but by a foreign loan: that loan is not yet negociated, and of cour&s;e it will require a good deal of time, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a loan practicable, to get the bank e&s;tabli&s;hed; and I much fear that by keeping our affairs afloat in their pre&s;ent wild, un&s;table condition during that time, we &s;hould &s;uffer greater mi&s;|chief than the profits of the &s;cheme would compen&s;ate. The thought puts me in mind of a man who to gain half a crown in a bargain would expend five &s;hillings in liquor to intoxicate the other party and bring him to a proper temper for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid I tru&s;t it will not be under&s;tood that I am an advocate for the appreciating of money farther than may be nece&s;&s;ary to bring it to a &s;teady, known, and certain value; but to this point I think it is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to bring it as &s;peed|ily as po&s;&s;ible. To e&s;tabli&s;h this po&s;ition, I could, if it were ne|ce&s;&s;ary, add a variety of political as well as moral arguments; but I pre&s;ume it is too obvious to need illu&s;tration. I &s;hall therefore proceed to &s;tate the plan which appears to me mo&s;t likely to pro|duce this effect. In doing this I &s;hall lay a&s;ide the idea of a foreign loan; not that I am oppo&s;ed to it, for I think, judiciou&s;ly managed, it might be u&s;ed to good purpo&s;e, but becau&s;e it is not within our reach for immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>The plan I propo&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of the following parts:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Funding the bills of credit emitted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A dome&s;tic loan for current &s;upplies, and</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Taxation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And 1&s;t as to funding the bills emitted: I would propo&s;e that it be recommended by Congre&s;s to the &s;everal legi&s;latures to pa&s;s laws
<PB N="11" REF="016247_0011_0F9BD017D35C11E8">acknowledging their &s;everal quotas re&s;pectively as a debt upon the State, and making provi&s;ion for redeeming it by taxes at certain periods, to commence at a given time after the war &s;hall be ended. This would fix it on a &s;olid foundation, and add greatly to the confidence of the people in its intrin&s;ic as well as extrin&s;ic value. What I mean-by its intrin&s;ic value is, the &s;um it will be worth at the time of its redemption, deducting compound intere&s;t from the time of reckoning till that period. By its extrin&s;ic value I mean its u&s;efulne&s;s as a medium of commerce in the mean time. This depends &s;o much on general opinion, or, in other words, a confi|dence that it will be fairly redeemed at a certain period, that no|thing &s;hould be left undone which would tend to &s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h this confidence. The rea&s;on why I propo&s;e that the peri|ods of redemption &s;hould commence at &s;ome time after the war &s;hall be ended, will appear in the next &s;ection.</P>
<P N="2">2. A dome&s;tic loan for current &s;upplies. I would propo&s;e that an e&s;timate be made of the &s;um that will probably be wanted for fix, nine, or twelve months; and that a loan be opened for this &s;um at a certain rate of depreciation, to be mea&s;ured either by the price of exchange for &s;terling money, or livres of I rance, or the price of wheat or &s;ome other &s;taple commodity of the country. But as &s;carcely any one commodity can be found that will bear &s;o even a price univer&s;ally throughout the United States as bills of exchange, I &s;hould think the price of exchange the be&s;t &s;tandard. Let it be computed as nearly as may be, what is the true degree of depreciation of money from the exce&s;s of quantity and &s;uch other circum&s;tances as are not at pre&s;ent removeable; that is, at what rate the value of money will be liquidated in the cour&s;e of com|merce, when confidence &s;hall be re&s;tored in its foundation and &s;tability, and let this be the rate at which it &s;hall be borrowed. Where this line will fall is not a&s;certained; nor do I think ex|actne&s;s on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, nece&s;&s;ary. I mu&s;t, however, &s;up|po&s;e a rate in order to explain my meaning the more fully; but whether I take it a few degrees too high or too low, is not material; the &s;cheme may be accommodated to any number that &s;hall be thought be&s;t. For the pre&s;ent then, let us &s;uppo&s;e this line of depreciation to be at eight for one.</P>
<P>This will hold up a view of profit to the holders of money that will probably in&s;ure a &s;peedy &s;upply. And this I think nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, to this purpo&s;e, the public and individuals who are to lend the money, have di&s;tinct and &s;eparate intere&s;ts from each other. In vain will it be &s;aid, that the&s;e per&s;ons are part of the community, and ought to contribute all in their power to its welfare. The community and they are placed in oppo&s;ition to each other as con|tracting parties, each con&s;ulting its own intere&s;t in the bargain, and trying to make it as favourable to it&s;elf as it can. So far as relates
<PB N="12" REF="016247_0012_0F9BD0188F9282E0">to pecuniary matters, the patrioti&s;m of every individual is &s;atisfied if he contributes his proportion in the way pointed out by govern|ment. It is in per&s;onal and mental &s;ervices that patrioti&s;m exhibits its extraordinary efforts. Loans are therefore to be obtained only by holding up terms of advantage to the lender. Such terms do not always imply the di&s;advantage of the borrower, and even where they do, it may be more than balanced by avoiding greater evils, or obtaining proportionate benefit. It is moreover to the honor as well as to the intere&s;t of the public, to offer &s;uch terms as will <HI>com|mand</HI> rather than <HI>&s;olicit</HI> the requi&s;ite &s;upplies.</P>
<P>In order to give every one an equal chance of &s;ub&s;cribing to the loan, let the &s;um wanted be divided in due proportions &s;o that every State may take its quota, provided it be &s;ub&s;cribed within a certain limited time,&mdash;&s;ay two months, after proper notice that the office is open: and if the quota is not &s;ub&s;cribed in that time, let other States, whole inhabitants are more willing to &s;ub&s;cribe, have the benefit of doing it. And the better to accomodate the &s;ub&s;cribers, allow them a certain rea&s;onable time after &s;ub&s;cription for paying in part of the money; and let the Loan-officers be au|thorized and directed to appoint deputies in different parts &s;o as be&s;t to accomodate the people.</P>
<P>For every eight hundred dollars &s;ub&s;cribed and paid in, give the &s;ub&s;criber a bill or certificate for 500 livres of France, bearing intere&s;t at &s;ix per cent, per annum, redeemable in current money either at the rate of eight dollars for five livres, or at the current rate of bills of exchange on France at the time fixed for payment, at the option of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the certificate: the intere&s;t to be paid annually in the like manner. It may be be&s;t that Congre&s;s &s;hould re&s;erve the liberty of redeeming the&s;e bilis at any time after one year, giving rea&s;onable (&s;ay three months) notice of &s;uch their intention, in order that they may check the appreciation of money if it &s;hould be likely to pa&s;s the line at which they have borrowed. And for this purpo&s;e and as a farther check on the value of money, I would propo&s;e that all the money which the different States can turn into the Continental Trea&s;ury by taxes during the war, be re&s;erved by Congre&s;s as a fund to be appropriated as they may find occa&s;ion from time to time, to the payment of intere&s;t, the redemp|tion of the&s;e loan-bills, or the reducing of the quantity of money in circulation. By the&s;e means money may be kept at a &s;teady certain value, which I take to be an object of great importance and worthy of the fir&s;t attention. Whatever &s;urplus of the taxes may remain, may then be u&s;ed in common expenditures and thereby le&s;&s;en the occa&s;ion for future loans; but I would wi&s;h to &s;ee the fir&s;t loan calculated for a full &s;upply without any reliance on taxes for current expences, as well to avoid di&s;appointment, as to in&s;ure the liquidation of the value of money to a certainty.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016247_0013_0F9BD0194F8EC5D8">
If to this plan of borrowing when dige&s;ted and put into form, Congre&s;s &s;hould ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a recommendation to the Legi&s;latures of the re&s;pective States to pa&s;s laws or re&s;olutions to aid the carrying it into execution, it would almon infallibly in&s;ure it &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. Taxation. This is a bu&s;ine&s;s that lies chiefly with the Le|gi&s;latures of the re&s;pective States, and each may differ from another as to the means and manner of rai&s;ing its quota, without injury to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Continental Finances. I therefore take no farther notice of it in this place, than as I conceive it to come within the duty of Congre&s;s&punc; who may with propriety recommend as to the time, and the quantity of money to be rai&s;ed for Continental pur|po&s;es. Such recommendations &s;eem indeed to be nece&s;&s;ary in order to keep the different States as nearly as may be on an equal footing in this re&s;pect; for though it may, and probably will prove bene|ficial to tho&s;e Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, which, by early exertions, &s;hall run foremo&s;t in di&s;charging their quota of the public debt; yet many con&s;ider|ations, which need not now be mentioned, point out the propriety of keeping them nearly equal. I &s;hould therefore think it mo&s;t adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able in Concre&s;s to calculate their requi&s;itions upon a &s;cale that even the hindmo&s;t may probably cenform to, barring extraor|dinary circum&s;tances &s;uch as the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Georgia; at the &s;ame time not di&s;couraging tho&s;e who may choo&s;e to exceed it.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s before I conclude, to take notice of &s;ome objections which I have heard &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t any plan of this kind.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are &s;o extremely tenacious of the honor of Con|gre&s;s, that they &s;eem di&s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to hazard any con&s;equences, rather than any public acknowledgment &s;hould be made, even by impli|cation, that money is depreciated; as they &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch acknow|ledgment would be a breach of public faith. This I take to be nicety in the extreme. I would by all means be as tender of the national honor as is con&s;i&s;tent with its health; but I would not nur&s;e its complexion &s;o far as to neglect its &s;trength and u&s;efulne&s;s. If the propo&s;ed plan of borrowing had any tendency to injure former contracts, there might be &s;ome weight in this objection; but it is propo&s;ed merely as a &s;eparate, independent and temporary affair, having neither relation to nor connection with the former contracts &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the public and individuals, farther than as it may tend to enable the public to comply with its engagements. The bills of credit may neverthele&s;s, in due &s;ea&s;on be redeemed in the ordinary cour&s;e by taxes, at their nominal value, without any re|ference to depreciation, and former loans may be paid off on the &s;ame terms and in the &s;ame manner as if this &s;cheme had never ap|peared. It may indeed ha&s;ten the time at which they may be re|deemed on proper terms, and the lenders may, in the mean time, receive their intere&s;t at le&s;s di&s;advantage, but I &s;ee not how it will
<PB N="14" REF="016247_0014_0F9BD01A15708680">otherwi&s;e affect them, What ground then have we for the exerci&s;e of this fal&s;e pride? And whither would it lead us, but to &s;truggle on in our pre&s;ent cour&s;e till we get &s;o deeply entangled that we can by no means extricate our&s;elves but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cutting the cord, and by a general cra&s;h annihilating our infant national character.</P>
<P>Some are oppo&s;ed to all loans whether foreign or dome&s;tic, and are for relying altogether upon taxes. The&s;e I would leave to be combated by tho&s;e who are for throwing the whole burden of our taxes upon po&s;terity, as I look upon both the propo&s;itions to be in|eligible extremes</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that a dome&s;tic loan would not check the depreciation, becau&s;e the loan certificates, being negoctable, would operate as an increa&s;e of the circulating medium. I am of opinion they would have rather a contrary effect. It will take &s;ome time to reduce and &s;ettle money at its &s;tandard value; during that time the certificates would be of &s;o much more value than the bills of credit that no one would offer them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n lieu of money. This &s;tandard value of money when &s;ettled will nor be better than the mere principal of the certificates; the growing intere&s;t will there|fore keep the latter more valuable, and they will remain locked up as a precious kind of property, or become objects of purcha&s;e which would enhance the value of money by increa&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s u&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;uppo&s;e an apparent appreciation of money, and hence ari&s;es another objection, viz. That it increa&s;es the na|tional debt by &s;o much as the money appreciates in value. The idea on which this objection is founded I take to be illu&s;ive. Ab|&s;tractedly con&s;idered, the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have the defired effect, will not work any real appreciation: it will only reduce money to its natural and proper &s;tate, like an ingredient thrown into fermenting or boiling liquor to &s;ub&s;ide the froth and reduce its &s;urface to a proper level. Will any one pretend that be|cau&s;e money is at pre&s;ent blown up by unnatural cau&s;es, as it were, into a bubble, we are to &s;eize the occa&s;ion and mea&s;ure its contents by its &s;urface? As well might we take the depth of water in a river by mea&s;uring from the top of the &s;urge in a &s;torm.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o that the&s;e terms will afford too great an advantage to the money-holders, who have purcha&s;ed it, and therefore can afford to part with it, at a much greater rate of depreciation; and that, as prices will not &s;uddenly come down to the proper rate, it will be too great a &s;acrifice of the public intere&s;t to borrow money at a depreciation of eight for one, and i&s;&s;ue it at fifteen or twenty. &mdash;Arguments of this kind are like placing a farthing &s;o near the eye as to ob&s;cure a broad piece at a di&s;tance: And be&s;ides, they prove too much. A con&s;iderable part of the money emitted has been i&s;&s;ued at a par with gold and &s;ilver, and at different rates of depreciation within the fine now propo&s;ed to be drawn. Would not this doc|trine
<PB N="15" REF="016247_0015_0F9BD01AD123C1A0">hold up to the individuals who received it at the&s;e rates, a claim of compen&s;ation for all the depreciation &s;ince they received it? The public trea&s;ury mu&s;t be &s;upplied; and the means nece&s;&s;ary to obtain that &s;upply mu&s;t be u&s;ed. This appa|rent &s;acrifice on the part of the public (though in effect it amounts to little) appears to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as the only means by which a &s;ufficient &s;upply can be rai&s;ed in due &s;ea&s;on. I doubt not but that a con&s;iderable &s;um of money might be rai&s;ed on a more &s;canty plan; but unle&s;s a &s;um &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e is procur|ed, it would fail of the proper effect. And &s;hall we ri&s;k our de|pendance on doubtful experiments when a failure might prove fa|tal? Great affairs mu&s;t be managed on a large and liberal &s;cale. Many con&s;iderations which claim our attention in the oeconomy of our private affairs, cea&s;e to pertain to oeconomy in larger concerns. Too great an attention to &s;mall &s;avings in national affairs not unfre|quently occa&s;ions the lo&s;s of great advantages.</P>
<P>The evils ari&s;ing from the in&s;tability and want of force in money are too numerous to admit of particular mention, and too glaring not to be &s;een. Turn which way we will they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view. All our public dapartments are labouring in the mid&s;t of difficulties which daily threaten their total ob&s;truction; the&s;e I apprehend will in a great mea&s;ure vani&s;h the moment the propo&s;ed &s;cheme &s;hews its power of &s;ucce&s;s. We may want large &s;upplies of articles to be purcha&s;ed for years to come, the prices of which will depend on the value of money: If therefore this mea|&s;ure will place money on &s;uch a footing as to re&s;tore its activity and u&s;efulne&s;s as a medium, and reduce prices to a &s;ettled &s;tandard, how much more valuable is the object than the expence of obtain|ing it? Thou&s;ands of tho&s;e who now devote them&s;elves to no o|ther pur&s;uit than &s;peculating in a de&s;tructive intermediate traffic be|tween the importer and the con&s;umer of goods, would be turned to u&s;eful employments, or at lea&s;t become harmle&s;s members of &s;o|ciety. A great part of that legion of &s;ubalterns now nece&s;&s;ary to effect the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;taff departments of the army, in&s;tead of being incumbents upon, would become more u&s;eful members of the community. The nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for the army, which are now with difficulty found in their various rece&s;&s;es, reluctantly parted with by their re&s;pective owners, and drawn to the proper magazines at an amazing expence of labour as well as money, would be of|fered for &s;ale in plenty at the mo&s;t convenient places for their re|ception. Commerce would again re&s;ume its natural cour&s;e, in which alone it can flouri&s;h, and every individual of the communi|ty with the wonted ea&s;e would be accomodated by &s;upplying his wants, and di&s;po&s;ing of &s;uch commodities to advantage as he might have to &s;pare. Indu&s;try, the only true &s;ource of wealth and nati|onal
<PB N="16" REF="016247_0016_0F9BD01B9CE16308">&s;trength, would be excited, and the nece&s;&s;aries and conveni|ences of life would abound even in the mid&s;t of war.</P>
<P>But a con&s;ideration of more immediate weight in our pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances is the probability of its &s;hortening the duration of the war. The remaining hopes of conque&s;t, which for &s;ome time pa&s;t have had little el&s;e but the derangement of our finances to keep them a|live in the minds of our enemies, would expire on our effecting a proper reformation in this re&s;pect&punc; They would then probably give over the delu&s;ive pur&s;uit and &s;eek for peace; or at lea&s;t apply their force to other objects &s;o as to relieve us from the great exer|tions their continued inva&s;ions have hitherto occa&s;ioned.</P>
