<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"AS the people of England cannot be bound by any law, without the con&s;ent of their repre&s;entatives fir&s;t had in parliament; &s;o neither can any En|gli&s;hman &s;uffer in his per&s;on, or e&s;tate, for the breach of any laws, or for any real, or pretended crime, without the con&s;ent of the people fir&s;t had by a jury of his peers, or equals:" therefore,</P>
<P>It can never be un&s;ea&s;onable to in|form, or to remind. Jurors of their duty; becau&s;e they are the per&s;ons, on whom the property, the liberty, and the lives of their fellow-&s;ubjects de|pend. When que&s;tions, however, which relate to the national liberty of the people, are agitated in the courts of ju&s;tice; it becomes of the utmo&s;t con|&s;equence, that tho&s;e who &s;erve upon Juries &s;hould be acquainted with their <HI>duties.</HI> For, if Juries are de&s;titute of the in&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary upon the&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0">occa&s;ions, we mu&s;t not expect that they will exert them&s;elves with &s;pirit: while they remain ignorant of the nature of their &s;tation, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould feel its impor|tance.</P>
<P>Men of great eminence in the law have publicly declared, that encroach|ments have lately been made upon the <HI>rights</HI> of Juries. To enquire into the truth of this charge is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, not only to Jurors, but to the whole body of the people; as there is no man who may not, directly, or indirectly, be affected by the&s;e inva&s;ions. Indeed, the good intentions and di&s;po|&s;itions of Jurymen will avail little to the &s;ecurity of the nation, if they are <HI>fraudulently,</HI> or <HI>forcibly,</HI> prevented from di&s;charging the <HI>duties</HI> of their <HI>office.</HI></P>
<P>A knowledge, therefore, of whatever relates to the office of Juries, &s;eems at this time e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince from hence alone can ari&s;e the proper <HI>execution</HI> of its <HI>duties,</HI> and the <HI>pre&s;erva|tion</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0">of its <HI>rights.</HI>&mdash;To promote the&s;e purpo&s;es, the following little pamphlet is now republi&s;hed. Its character for per&s;picuity, and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it is unnece&s;|&s;ary to enlarge upon it here. If it meets with the &s;ucce&s;s which its merit de&s;erves, it will perhaps be a principal means of pre&s;erving the <HI>trial</HI> by <HI>Jury,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its full force, to po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS treati&s;e has pa&s;&s;ed through many editions. It appeared fir&s;t in the year 1680; it was reprinted in the year 1731, &amp; again in 1763, 1764, 1770 and 1771; and is now pre&s;ented to the public at lea&s;t for the &s;eventh time.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Many circum&s;tances might lead the reader to &s;u&s;pect, that this Di|alogue has been altered in order to ac|commodate it to the pre&s;ent times. This edition, however, has been care|fully collated with the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> which was printed in London for Richard Janeway, in Queen's Head Alley, Pater-no&s;ter-Row, in the year 1680: and &s;o &s;cru|pulou&s;ly has the Original been adhered to, that not a &s;ingle word has been al|tered, except in the tran&s;lation of the Latin &s;entences in page 3, the latter of which was before unintelligible. Li|berties, indeed, have been taken with the orthography, and pointing; but the&s;e have not in the lea&s;t affected the &s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>MY old <HI>Client!</HI> a good morning to you: whither &s;o fa&s;t? you &s;eem intent upon &s;ome important affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worthy Sir! I am glad to &s;ee you thus <HI>opportunely,</HI> there being &s;carce any per&s;on that I could at this time rather have wi&s;hed to meet with.</P>

<P>I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf happy, if in any thing I can &s;erve you.&mdash;The <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> I pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ummoned to appear <HI>upon a Jury,</HI> and was ju&s;t going to try if I could get off. Now I doubt not but you can put me into the be&s;t way to obtain that favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is probable I could: but fir&s;t let me know the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> why you de&s;ire to <HI>decline that &s;ervice.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, there is &s;omething of <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>lo&s;s of time</HI> in it; and men's <HI>lives, li|berties,</HI> and <HI>e&s;tates</HI> (which depend upon a jury's <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> for the plaintiff, or for the defendant) are <HI>weighty things.</HI> I would not wrong my con&s;cience for a world, nor be acce&s;&s;ary to any man's ruin. There are others <HI>better &s;killed</HI> in &s;uch matters. I have ever &s;o loved <HI>peace,</HI> that I have forborne going to <HI>law,</HI> (as you well know many times) though it hath been much to my lo&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend your <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> and <HI>mode&s;ty;</HI> yet mu&s;t tell you, the&s;e are but general and <HI>weak</HI> excu&s;es.</P>
<P>As for your time and trouble, it is not <HI>much;</HI> and however, can it be better &s;pent than in doing <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and &s;erving your country? to withdraw your&s;elf in &s;uch ca&s;es, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a kind of <HI>Sacrilege,</HI> a rob|bing of the public of tho&s;e duties which you ju&s;tly owe it; the more <HI>peaceable man</HI> you have been, the <HI>more fit</HI> you are. For the office of a <HI>Juryman</HI> is, <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ly to judge his neighbour;</HI> and needs no more <HI>law</HI> than is ea&s;ily learnt to direct him therein. I look upon you therefore as a man well qualified with <HI>e&s;tate, di&s;cretion, &amp; integrity;</HI> and if all &s;uch as you &s;hould u&s;e private means to avoid it, how would the king and country be hone&s;tly &s;erved? At that rate we &s;hould have none but <HI>fools</HI> or <HI>knaves</HI> entru&s;ted in this grand concern, on which (as you well ob&s;erve) the lives, liberties, and e&s;tates of all <HI>England</HI> depend.</P>
<P>Your <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> not to be acce&s;&s;ary to any man's being wronged or ruined, is (as I &s;aid) much to be commended. But may you not incur it unawares, by &s;eeking thus to avoid it? <HI>Pilate</HI> was not inno|cent becau&s;e he wa&s;hed his hands, and &s;aid, <HI>He would have nothing to do with the blood of that ju&s;t one.</HI> There are faults of <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> as well as <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> When you are <HI>legally called</HI> to try &s;uch a cau&s;e, if you &s;hall <HI>&s;huffle</HI> out your&s;elf, and thereby per&s;ons perhaps <HI>le&s;s con&s;cientious</HI> happen to be made u&s;e of, and &s;o a <HI>villain</HI> e&s;capes ju&s;tice, or an <HI>innocent</HI> man is ruined, by a <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>negli|gent</HI> verdict; can you think your&s;elf in &s;uch a ca&s;e wholly blamele&s;s? <HI>Qui non prohibet cum po|te&s;t, jubet: That man abets an evil, who prevents it not, when it is in his power.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I think a man is bound to <HI>do all the good</HI> he can, e&s;pecially when he is lawfully called to it. But there &s;ometimes happen <HI>nice ca&s;es,</HI> wherein it may be difficult to di&s;charge one's con&s;cience without incurring the <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of the court, and thence <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>damage</HI> may ari&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is but a <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>needle&s;s</HI> fear. For as the jurors <HI>privileges</HI> (and every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s in and by them) are very con&s;iderable; &s;o the laws have no le&s;s providently <HI>guarded</HI> them again&s;t inva&s;ion or u&s;urpation. So that there needs no more than, fir&s;t, <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> to know your duty; and, in the next place, <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>re&s;olution</HI> to practi&s;e it with impartiality &amp; integrity, free from accur&s;ed <HI>bribery</HI> and malice, or (what is full as bad in the end) ba&s;e and &s;ervile <HI>fear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jurym.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;atisfied, that as it is for the <HI>ad|vantage</HI> and honour of the public, that men of <HI>under&s;tanding, &s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> &s;hould be em|ployed to &s;erve on juries, that <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right</HI> may fairly be admini&s;tered; &s;o it is <HI>their own</HI> in|tere&s;t, when called thereunto, readily to be&s;tow their attendance and &s;ervice, to prevent <HI>ill prece|dents</HI> from men otherwi&s;e qualified; which may by degrees <HI>fatally,</HI> though in&s;en&s;ibly, undermine our ju&s;t birth-rights, and perhaps <HI>fall heavy</HI> one day upon us, or our po&s;terity. But, for my own part, I am fearful le&s;t I &s;hould &s;uffer through my <HI>ig|norance</HI> of the duty and office of a juryman; and, therefore, on that account principally it is, that I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed in my appearance; which if I under&s;tood but &s;o well as I hope many others do, I would with all my heart attend the &s;ervice.</P>

<P>You &s;peak hone&s;tly, and like an <HI>Engli&s;h|man.</HI> But if that be all your cau&s;e of &s;cruple, it may &s;oon be removed, if you will but give your|&s;elf a very <HI>little trouble</HI> of enquiry into the nece&s;|&s;ary provi&s;ions of the law of <HI>England</HI> relating to this matter.</P>

<P>There is nothing (of a <HI>temporal</HI> con|cern) that I would more gladly be informed in; becau&s;e I am &s;atisfied, it is very <HI>expedient</HI> to be generally known. And fir&s;t, I would learn <HI>how long</HI> trials by juries have been u&s;ed in this na|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Barr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even <HI>time out of mind;</HI> &s;o long, that our be&s;t <HI>hi&s;torians</HI> cannot date the original of the in&s;titution, being indeed <HI>cotemporary</HI> with the na|tion it&s;elf, or in u&s;e as &s;oon as the people were re|duced to any form of <HI>civil government,</HI> and ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Nor have the &s;everal con|que&s;ts or revolutions, the mixtures of <HI>foreigners,</HI> or the mutual feuds of the <HI>natives,</HI> at any time, been able to &s;uppre&s;s or overthrow it. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. That juries (the <HI>thing</HI> in effect and <HI>&s;ub|&s;tance,</HI> tho' perhaps not ju&s;t the number of <HI>twelve</HI> men) were in u&s;e among the <HI>Britons,</HI> the fir&s;t in|habitants of this i&s;land, appears by the ancient monuments and writings of that nation, atte&s;ting that their <HI>Freeholders</HI> had always a <HI>&s;hare</HI> in all trials and determinations of differences.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mo&s;t certain it is, that they were practi&s;ed by the <HI>Saxons</HI>

<P>Your &s;ervant, Sir! under favour of your mighty wi&s;dom, &amp; experience, when I &s;aid no judge <HI>could do it,</HI> I &s;pake the more like a <HI>Barri&s;ter;</HI> for it is a maxim in law&mdash;<HI>Id po&s;&s;umus, quod Jure po&s;|&s;umus;</HI> a man is &s;aid to be <HI>able</HI> to do only &s;o much, as he may <HI>lawfully do.</HI> But &s;uch fining, and im|pri&s;oning, cannot <HI>lawfully</HI> be done; the judges have no <HI>right, or power,</HI> by law, to do it; and therefore it may well be &s;aid, they <HI>cannot,</HI> or are <HI>not able</HI> to do it.</P>
<P>And whereas you &s;ay, that &s;ome <HI>Juries in our memory</HI> have been fined and impri&s;oned, you may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay true; but it is as true, that it hath been only in our memory; for no &s;uch thing was practi&s;ed in antient times; for &s;o I find it a&s;&s;erted by a late learned judge

<P>At the &s;e&s;&s;ions for <HI>London, Sept.</HI> 1670, <HI>William Pen,</HI> and <HI>William Mead</HI> (two of the people com|monly called <HI>Quakers</HI>) were indicted, for that they with others, to the number of three hundred, on the 14th <HI>Aug.</HI> 22 <HI>Regis,</HI> in <HI>Gracechurch-Street,</HI> did with force, and arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unlawfully, and tu|multuou&s;ly, a&s;&s;emble, and congregate them&s;elves together, to the di&s;turbance of the peace; and that the &s;aid <HI>William Pen</HI> did there preach, and &s;peak, to the &s;aid <HI>Mead,</HI> and other per&s;ons in the open &s;treet; by rea&s;on whereof, a great concour&s;e, and <HI>tumult,</HI> of people in the &s;treet afore&s;aid then, and there, a long time, did remain, and continue, in contempt of our &s;aid lord the king, and of his law, to the great <HI>di&s;turbance</HI> of his peace, to the great <HI>terror</HI> and di&s;turbance, of many of his liege people, and &s;ubjects, to the ill example of all others in the like ca&s;e offenders, and again&s;t the peace of our &s;aid lord the king, his crown, and dignity.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners pleading <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> it was proved, that there <HI>was a meeting</HI> at the time in the in|dictment mentioned, in <HI>Gracechurch-Street,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of three, or four hundred people, in the open &s;treet; that <HI>William Pen</HI> was <HI>&s;peaking, or preaching,</HI> to them, but <HI>what</HI> he &s;aid, the witne&s;&s;es (who were officers and &s;oldiers &s;ent to di&s;per&s;e them) could not <HI>hear.</HI>&mdash;This was the effect of the evidence; which Sir <HI>John Howel,</HI> the then record|er, (as I find in the <HI>print</HI> of that trial) was plea&s;ed to &s;um up to the Jury, in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>You have heard what the indictment is; it is for preaching to the people in the &s;treet, and drawing a tumultuous company after them, and Mr. <HI>Pen</HI> was &s;peaking: if they &s;hould not be di&s;turbed, you &s;ee they will go on: there are

<P N="2">2. It is not &s;aid, that they acquitted the per|&s;ons indicted again&s;t full and manife&s;t evidence, <HI>cor|ruptly, and knowing the &s;aid evidence to be full and

<P>But now as to the po&s;itive qualifications requi&s;ite.</P>
<P N="1">1. You that are Jurymen, &s;hould, fir&s;t of all, &s;e|riou&s;ly regard the weight, and importance, of the
<PB N="52" REF="012414_0048_0F8997CF7437D028">office; your own &s;ouls, other mens lives, liberties, e&s;tates, all that in this world are dear to them, are at &s;take, and in your hands; there|fore, con&s;ider things well before hand, and come &s;ub&s;tantially furni&s;hed, and provided, with &s;ound, and well grounded, con&s;ciences, with clear minds, free from malice, fear, hope, or favour; le&s;t, in&s;tead of <HI>judging</HI> others, thou &s;houlde&s;t work thy own condemnation, and &s;tand in the &s;ight of God, the Creator, and Judge, of all men, no better than a <HI>Murtherer,</HI> or <HI>perjured</HI> Malefactor.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve well the record, indictment, or in|formation that is read, and the &s;everal parts there|of, both as to the matter, manner, and form.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take due notice of, and pay regard, to the evidence offered for proof of the indictment, and each part of it, as well to <HI>manner,</HI> and <HI>form,</HI> as <HI>matter;</HI> and if you &s;u&s;pect any &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bornation, foul practice, or tampering hath been with the witne&s;|&s;es, or that they have any malice, or &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, have a &s;pecial regard to the circum&s;tances, or inco|herences, of their tales, and endeavour, by apt que|&s;tions, to &s;ift out the truth, or di&s;cover the villainy. And, for your better &s;atisfaction, endeavour to write down the evidence, or the heads thereof, that you may, the better, recall it to memory.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take notice of the nature of the crime charg|ed, and what law the pro&s;ecution is grounded upon, and di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal fact, which is proved, from the aggravating circum&s;tances, which are not proved.</P>
<P N="5">5. Remember that in Juries there is no plurality of voices to be allowed: &s;even cannot over rule, or, by virtue of majority, conclude five; no, nor eleven, one. But as the verdict is given in the name of all the twelve, or el&s;e it is void; &s;o every one of them mu&s;t be actually agreeing, and &s;atis|fied in his particular under&s;tanding, and con&s;ci|ence,

And, therefore, if one man differ in opinion from his fellows, they mu&s;t be kept together, till either they, by &s;trength of rea|&s;on, or argument, can &s;atisfy him, or he convince them. For he is not to be hectored, much le&s;s pu|ni&s;hed, by the court into a compliance; for as the lord chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Vaughan</HI> &s;ays well
