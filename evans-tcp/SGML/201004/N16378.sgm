<HEAD>NUMBER I. <HI>On the Foederal Government, and fir&s;t on the &s;afety of the people, from the re&s;traints impo&s;ed on the Pre&s;ident.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for an hone&s;t and feeling mind, of any nation or country whatever, to be in&s;en&s;ible to the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of America. Were I an Ea&s;t Indian, or a Turk, I &s;hould con&s;ider this &s;ingular &s;ituation of a part of my fellow creatures as the mo&s;t curious and intere&s;ting. Intimately con|nected with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> country, as a citizen of the union, I confe&s;s it entirely engro&s;&s;es my mind and feelings.</P>
<P>To take a proper view of the ground on which we &s;tand, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to recollect the manner in which the United States were originally &s;ettled and
<PB N="4" REF="021028_0004_0FB177C2EC7CB3D0">e&s;tabli&s;hed. Want of charity in the religious &s;y&s;tems of Europe, and of ju&s;tice in their political govern|ments, were the principal moving cau&s;es, which drove the emigrants of various countries to the Ame|rican continent. The Congregationali&s;ts, Quakers, Pre&s;byterians and other Briti&s;h di&s;&s;enters, the Catho|lics of England and Ireland, the Hugonots of France, the German Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, and Moravians, with &s;everal other &s;ocieties, e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the different colonies, thereby laying the ground of that liberality in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, which has been ob&s;ervable &s;ince the late revolution. Religious liber|ty naturally promotes corre&s;ponding di&s;po&s;itions in matters of government. The con&s;titution of En|gland, <HI>as it &s;tood on paper,</HI> was one of the free&s;t, at that time, in the world, and the American colonies con&s;idered them&s;elves as entitled to the fulle&s;t enjoy|ment of it. Thus, when the ill-judged di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of late times in England brought into que&s;tion the rights of this country, as it &s;tood connected with the Briti&s;h crown, we were found more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;|ed with their importance, and accurately acquainted with their extent, than the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t learned of our brethren beyond the Atlantic. When the great|e&s;t names in parliament in&s;i&s;ted on the power of that body over the commerce of the colonies, and even the right to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, America, &s;eeing that it was only <HI>another form of tyranny,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon the immutable truth, that taxation and repre|&s;entation are in&s;eparable; and, while a de&s;ire of har|mony and other con&s;iderations induced her into an acquie&s;cence in the commercial regulations of Great-Britain, it was done from the declared nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and with a cautious, full, and ab&s;olute &s;aving of our voluntarily-&s;u&s;pended rights. The parliament was per&s;evering, and America continued <HI>firm,</HI> till ho&s;tilities and open war commenced, and finally <HI>the late revolution clo&s;ed the conte&s;t for-ever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021028_0005_0FB177C52CA1EF10">
It is evident, from this &s;hort detail, and the reflec|tions which ari&s;e from it, that the quarrel between the United States and the parliament of Great-Bri|tain did not ari&s;e &s;o much from objections to the form of government, <HI>though undoubtedly a better one by far is now within our reach,</HI> as from a difference concerning certain important rights, re&s;ulting from the e&s;&s;ential principles of liberty, which their con&s;titution actually pre&s;erved to all the &s;ubjects re&s;iding within the realm. It was not a&s;&s;erted by America, that the people of <HI>the i&s;land of Great-Britain</HI> were &s;laves, but that <HI>we,</HI> though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> of the &s;ame rights, were not admitted to enjoy <HI>an equal degree of freedom.</HI></P>
<P>When the declaration of independence compleated the &s;eparation between the two countries, new go|vernments were nece&s;&s;arily e&s;tabli&s;hed. Many cir|cum&s;tances led to the adoption of the republican form, among which was the <HI>predilection of the people.</HI> In devi&s;ing the frames of government, it may have been difficult to avoid extremes oppo&s;ite to the vices of that we had ju&s;t rejected; neverthele&s;s, many of the &s;tate con&s;titutions we have cho&s;en are truly excel|lent. Our misfortunes have been, <HI>that in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance we adopted no national government at all;</HI> but were kept together by common danger only; <HI>and that in the confu&s;ions of a civil war, we framed a foederal con&s;titu|tion, now univer&s;ally admitted to be inadequate to the pre|&s;ervation of liberty, property, and the union.</HI> The que&s;ti|on is not, then, how far our &s;tate con&s;titutions are good, or otherwi&s;e&mdash;the object of our wi&s;hes is, <HI>to amend and &s;upply the evident and allowed errors and defects of the foederal government.</HI> Let us con&s;ider a while, that which is now propo&s;ed to us&mdash;let us compare it with the &s;o much boa&s;ted Briti&s;h form of government, and &s;ee <HI>how much more</HI> it favours the people, and <HI>how com|pletely</HI> it &s;ecures their rights, remembering, at the &s;ame time, that we did not di&s;&s;olve our connection
<PB N="6" REF="021028_0006_0FB177C656C9ADE0">with that country &s;o much on account of its con&s;titu|tion, as the perver&s;ion and mal-admini&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, let us look at the nature and powers of the head of that country, and tho&s;e of the <HI>o&s;ten&s;ible</HI> head of ours.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h king is <HI>the great bi&s;hop</HI> or &s;upreme head of an e&s;tabli&s;hed church, with an immen&s;e patronage annexed. In this capacity he commands a number of votes in the hou&s;e of lords, by creating bi&s;hops, who, be&s;ides their great incomes, have votes in that a&s;&s;embly, and are judges in the la&s;t re&s;ort. The&s;e prelates have al&s;o many honorable and <HI>lucrative places</HI> to be&s;tow, and thus from their wealth, learning, dig|nities, powers, and patronage, give a great lu&s;tre and <HI>an enormous influence</HI> to the crown.</P>
<P>In America, our pre&s;ident will not only be <HI>without</HI> the&s;e influencing advantages, <HI>but they will be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the people at large, to &s;trengthen their hands in the event of a conte&s;t with him.</HI> All religious funds, honors and powers, are in the gift of numberle&s;s un|connected, di&s;united and contending corporations, wherein the principle of <HI>perfect equality univer&s;ally pre|vails.</HI> In &s;hort, danger from <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny,</HI> that long &s;tanding and &s;till remaining <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of the people &mdash;that <HI>&s;acrilegious engine</HI> of royal power in &s;ome coun|tries&mdash;can be feared by no man in the United States. In Britain, their king is <HI>for life</HI>&mdash;in America, our Pre&s;ident will always <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> one of the people</HI> at the end of four years. In that country, the king is <HI>hereditary,</HI> and may be an ideot, a knave, or a tyrant by nature, or ignorant from neglect of his education, yet cannot be removed, for <HI>"he can do no wrong."</HI> This is a favorite maxim of their con&s;titution. In America, as the Pre&s;ident is to be one of the people at the end of his &s;hort term, &s;o will <HI>he</HI> and his fellow citizens remember, <HI>that he was originally one of the people; and that he is created by their breath.</HI> Further, he cannot be
<PB N="7" REF="021028_0007_0FB177C78242FEA8">an ideot, probably not a knave or tyrant, for tho&s;e whom nature makes &s;o di&s;cover it before the age of thirty-five, until which period he cannot be elected. It appears, we have not admitted that he can do no wrong, but have rather pre-&s;uppo&s;ed he may and &s;ome|times will do wrong, by providing for <HI>his impeachment, his trial, and his peaceable and complete removal.</HI></P>
<P>In England the king has a power to create mem|bers of the upper hou&s;e, who are judges in the high|e&s;t court, as well as legi&s;lators. Our Pre&s;ident not only cannot make members of the Senate, but their creation, like his own, is by <HI>the people,</HI> through their repre&s;entatives: and a member of A&s;&s;embly may and will be as <HI>certainly</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the end of his year, for electing a weak or wicked Senator, as for any other blunder or mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>The king of England has complete legi&s;lative pow|er, while our Pre&s;ident can only u&s;e it when the other &s;ervants of the people are divided. But in all great ca&s;es affecting the national intere&s;ts or &s;afety, his modified and re&s;trained power mu&s;t give way to the &s;en&s;e of two-thirds of the legi&s;lature. In fact it amounts to no more, than a &s;erious duty impo&s;ed upon him to re|que&s;t both hou&s;es to re-con&s;ider any matter on which he entertains doubts or feels apprehen&s;ions; and hers the people have a &s;trong hold upon him <HI>from his &s;ole and per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of the upper-hou&s;e (or the chancel|lor) in England, is appointed by their king, while our Vice-Pre&s;ident, who is cho&s;en <HI>by the people,</HI> through the electors and the Senate, <HI>is not at all dependant on the Pre&s;ident,</HI> but may exerci&s;e equal powers on &s;ome occa&s;ions. In all royal governments, <HI>an helple&s;s in|fant</HI> or an inexperienced youth may wear the crown. <HI>Our Pre&s;ident mu&s;t be matured by the experience of years,</HI> and being born among us, his character at thirty-five mu&s;t be fully under&s;tood. Wi&s;dom, virtue and ac|tive
<PB N="8" REF="021028_0008_0FB177C90BC99FB8">qualities of mind and body can alone make him <HI>the fir&s;t &s;ervant</HI> of a free and enlightened people.</P>
<P>Our Pre&s;ident will fall very much &s;hort indeed of any prince in his annual income, which will not be hereditary, but <HI>the ab&s;olute allowance of the people, pa&s;|&s;ing through the hands of their other &s;ervants from year to year, as it becomes nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> There will be <HI>no burdens</HI> on the nation, to provide for his heir, or other branch|es of his family. It is probable, from the &s;tate of property in America, and other circum&s;tances, that <HI>many citizens will exceed him in &s;how and expence,</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e dazzling trappings of kingly rank and power. He will have no authority to make a treaty, without <HI>two thirds of the &s;enate,</HI> nor can he appoint amba&s;&s;adors or other great officers <HI>without their approbation,</HI> which will remove the idea of <HI>patronage and influence,</HI> and of per|&s;onal obligation and dependence. The appointment of even the inferior officers may be taken out of his hands by an act of congre&s;s at any time; he can cre|ate <HI>no nobility or titles of honour,</HI> nor take away offices during good behaviour. <HI>His per&s;on</HI> is not &s;o much protected as that of a member of the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives; for he may be proceeded again&s;t like any other man <HI>in the ordinary cour&s;e of law.</HI> He appoints <HI>no officer of the &s;eparate &s;tates.</HI> He will have no influ|ence <HI>from placemen in the legi&s;lature,</HI> nor can he prorogue or di&s;&s;olve it. He will have no power <HI>over the trea|&s;ures of the &s;tate;</HI> and, la&s;tly, as he is <HI>created</HI> through the electors, by the people at large, <HI>he mu&s;t ever look up to the &s;upport of his creators.</HI> From &s;uch a &s;ervant, with powers &s;o limited and tran&s;itory, there can be no danger, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the &s;olid founda|tions on which our national liberties are immoveably fixed, by the other provi&s;ions of this excellent con&s;ti|tution. Whatever of dignity or authority he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es, is <HI>a delegated part of their maje&s;ty and their political omnipotence, tran&s;iently ve&s;ted in him by the people them&s;elves, for their own happine&s;s.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. <HI>On the &s;afety of the people, from the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon the Senate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that the late honorable conventi|on, in de&s;ignating the nature of the chief exe|cutive office of the United States, <HI>have deprived it of all the dangerous appendages of royalty,</HI> and provided for <HI>the frequent expiration of its limited powers</HI>&mdash;As our pre|&s;ident bears <HI>no re&s;emblance to a king,</HI> &s;o we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;enate have <HI>no &s;imilitude to nobles.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, not being hereditary, their <HI>collective</HI> knowledge, wi&s;dom, and virtue are not precarious, <HI>for by the&s;e qualities alone they are to obtain their offices;</HI> and they will have none of the <HI>peculiar</HI> follies and vices of tho&s;e men, <HI>who po&s;&s;e&s;s power merely becau&s;e their fathers held it before them,</HI> for they will be educated (under equal advantages, and with equal pro&s;pects) among and on a footing with the other &s;ons of a free people. If we recollect the characters, who have, at various periods, filled the &s;eats of congre&s;s, we &s;hall find this expectation <HI>perfectly rea&s;onable. Many young</HI> men of ge|nius, and <HI>many characters of more matured abilities, without fortunes,</HI> have been honored with that tru&s;t. <HI>Wealth has had but few repre&s;entatives there, and tho&s;e have been generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of re&s;pectable per&s;onal qualifica|tions.</HI> There have al&s;o been many in&s;tances of per|&s;ons not eminently endowed with mental qualities, who have been &s;ent thither <HI>from a reliance on their vir|tues, public and private</HI>&mdash;As the &s;enators <HI>are &s;till to be elected by the legi&s;latures of the &s;tates,</HI> there can be no doubt of <HI>equal &s;afety and propriety</HI> in their future ap|pointment, e&s;pecially as no further pecuniary qualifi|cation is required by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021028_0010_0FB177CDB34CD3E8">
They can hold <HI>no other office</HI> civil or military under the United States, nor can they join <HI>in making provi&s;i|on for them&s;elves,</HI> either by creating new places, or en|crea&s;ing the emoluments of old ones. As their &s;ons are not to &s;ucceed them, they will not be induced to aim at an increa&s;e or perpetuity of their powers, at the expence of the liberties of the people, of which <HI>tho&s;e &s;ons</HI> will be a part. They po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>a much &s;maller &s;hare of the judicial power</HI> than the upper hou&s;e in Bri|tain, for they are not, as there, the highe&s;t court in civil affairs. Impeachments <HI>alone</HI> are the ca&s;es cog|nizable before them, and in what other place could matters of that nature be &s;o properly and &s;afely de|termined? The judges of the foederal courts will owe their appointments to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, there|fore may not feel &s;o perfectly free <HI>from favour, affection and influence,</HI> as the upper hou&s;e who receive their pow|er from the people, through their &s;tate repre&s;enta|tives, and are immediately re&s;pon&s;ible to tho&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies, and finally to the nation at large&mdash;Thus we &s;ee, when a daring or dangerous offender is brought to the bar of public ju&s;tice, the people, <HI>who alone can im|peach him by their immediate repre&s;entatives,</HI> will cau&s;e him to be tried, <HI>not by judges appointed in the heat of the occa|&s;ion,</HI> but by two-thirds of <HI>a &s;elect body, cho&s;en a long time before, for various purpo&s;es, by the collected wi&s;dom of of their &s;tate legi&s;latures.</HI> From a pretence or affecta|tion of extraordinary purity and excellence of cha|racter, <HI>their word of honour</HI> is the &s;anction, under which the&s;e high courts, in other countries, have given their &s;entence&mdash;But with us, like the other judges of the union, like the re&s;t of the people, <HI>of which they are never to forget they are a part,</HI> it is required that they be <HI>on oath.</HI></P>
<P>No ambitious, unde&s;erving or inexperienced <HI>youth</HI> can acquire a &s;eat in this hou&s;e by means of the mo&s;t enormous wealth, or mo&s;t powerful connections, <HI>till
<PB N="11" REF="021028_0011_0FB177CEF511F3E8">thirty years have ripened his abilities, and fully di&s;covered his merits to his country</HI>&mdash;a more rational ground of preference &s;urely than mere property.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, though more independent of the peo|ple, as to <HI>the free exerci&s;e of their judgment and abilities,</HI> than the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, by the longer term of their office, mu&s;t be older and more experienced men, and are ve&s;ted with le&s;s effective power; for the public trea&s;ures, <HI>the &s;inews of the &s;tate,</HI> cannot be cal|led forth by their original motion. They may indeed <HI>re&s;train the profu&s;ion or errors</HI> of the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives, <HI>but they cannot take any of the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to rai&s;e a national revenue.</HI></P>
<P>The people, through the electors, <HI>pre&s;cribe</HI> them &s;uch a pre&s;ident as &s;hall be <HI>be&s;t qualified to controul them.</HI></P>
<P>They can only, by conviction on impeachment, <HI>re|move and incapacitate a dangerous officer,</HI> but the puni&s;h|ment of him as a criminal <HI>remains within the province of the courts of law, to be conducted under all the ordinary forms and precautions,</HI> which exceedingly dimini&s;hes the importance of their judicial powers. They are <HI>de|tached,</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, from <HI>local</HI> prejudices in fa|vour of their re&s;pective &s;tates, by having <HI>a &s;eparate and independent vote,</HI> for the &s;en&s;ible and con&s;cientious u&s;e of which every member will find his <HI>per&s;on, honor and character</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly bound&mdash;He cannot &s;helter him&s;elf, <HI>under a vote in behalf of his &s;late,</HI> among his immediate colleagues. As there are only <HI>two,</HI> he cannot be vo|luntarily or involuntarily governed <HI>by the majority of the deputation</HI>&mdash;He will be obliged, by whole&s;ome pro|vi&s;ions, to <HI>attend his public duty,</HI> and thus in great na|tional que&s;tions <HI>mu&s;t give a vote,</HI> of the hone&s;ty of which he will find it is nece&s;&s;ary to convince his con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The &s;enate <HI>mu&s;t always receive the exceptions of the pre&s;i|dent</HI> again&s;t any of their legi&s;latve acts, which, without

<P>Each member of <HI>this truly popular a&s;&s;embly</HI> will be cho&s;en by about &s;ix thou&s;and electors, <HI>by the poor as well as the rich.</HI> No decayed or venal borough will have an <HI>unju&s;t</HI> &s;hare in their determinations&mdash;no old <HI>Sarum</HI> will &s;end thither a repre&s;entative <HI>by the voice of a &s;ingle elector.</HI>

<HEAD>NUMBER IV. <HI>The &s;ecurity for national &s;afety and happine&s;s, re&s;ulting from other parts of the foederal Government.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering the re&s;pective powers of the Pre&s;i|dent, the Senate and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, under the foederal con&s;titution, we have &s;een <HI>a part of the whole&s;ome precautions,</HI> which are contained in the new &s;y&s;tem. Let us examine what <HI>further &s;ecuri|ties for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the people</HI> are contained in the general &s;tipulations and provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The United States guarantee to every &s;tate in the union <HI>a &s;eparate republican form of government.</HI> From thence it follows, that any man or body of men, however rich or powerful, who &s;hall make an altera|tion in the form of government of any &s;tate, <HI>whereby the powers thereof &s;hall be attempted to be taken out of the hands of the people at large,</HI> will &s;tand <HI>guilty of high trea|&s;on;</HI> or &s;hould a <HI>foreign</HI> power &s;educe or over-awe the people of any &s;tate, &s;o as to cau&s;e them to ve&s;t in the families of any ambitous citizens or foreigners the powers of hereditary governors, <HI>whether as Kings or Nobles,</HI> that &s;uch inve&s;tment of powers would be <HI>void in it&s;elf,</HI> and every per&s;on <HI>attempting</HI> to execute them would al&s;o be <HI>guilty of trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>No <HI>religions</HI> te&s;t is ever to be required of any officer or &s;ervant of the United States. The people may em|ploy <HI>any wi&s;e and good citizen</HI> in the execution of the va|rious duties of the government. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, <HI>no prote&s;tant</HI> can hold a public tru&s;t. In En|gland <HI>every Pre&s;byterian, and other per&s;on not of their e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church,</HI> is incapable of holding an office. No &s;uch <HI>impious</HI> deprivation of the rights of men can take place under the new foederal con&s;titution. The con|vention
<PB N="16" REF="021028_0016_0FB177D7373C5D98">has the honour of propo&s;ing <HI>the fir&s;t public act,</HI> by which any nation has ever <HI>dive&s;ted it&s;elf</HI> of a power, every exerci&s;e of which is <HI>a tre&s;pa&s;s on the Maje&s;ty of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>No qualification <HI>in monied or landed property</HI> is requir|ed by the propo&s;ed plan; nor does it admit any pre|ference from the prepo&s;terous di&s;tinctions of <HI>birth and rank.</HI> The office of the Pre&s;ident, a Senator, and a Repre&s;entative, and every other place of <HI>power or pro|fit,</HI> are therefore open <HI>to the whole body of the people.</HI> Any wi&s;e, informed and upright man, be his proper|ty what it may, <HI>can exerci&s;e the tru&s;ts and powers of the &s;tate,</HI> provided he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the moral, religious and political virtues which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the con|fidence of his fellow citizens.</P>
<P>The importation of &s;laves from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> foreign coun|try is, by a clear implication, held up to the world as equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the di&s;po&s;itions and the du|ties of the people of America. A &s;olid foundation is laid for exploding the principles of negro &s;lavery, in which many good men of all parties in Penn&s;ylva|nia, and throughout the union, have already con|curred. The <HI>temporary</HI> re&s;ervation of any particular matter mu&s;t ever be deemed an admi&s;&s;ion that it &s;hould be done away. This appears to have been well under&s;tood. In addition to the arguments drawn from liberty, ju&s;tice and religion, opinions again&s;t this practice, <HI>founded in &s;ound policy,</HI> have no doubt been urged. Regard was nece&s;&s;arily paid to the peculiar &s;ituation of our &s;outhern fellow-citizens; but they, on the other hand, have not been in&s;en&s;ible of <HI>the delicate &s;ituation of our national character on this &s;ub|ject.</HI></P>
<P>The people will remain, under the propo&s;ed con|&s;titution, <HI>the fountain of power and public honour.</HI> The Pre&s;ident, the Senate, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, will be <HI>the channels</HI> through which the &s;tream
<PB N="17" REF="021028_0017_0FB177D8D92FBD18">will flow&mdash;but it will flow <HI>from the people,</HI> and from them <HI>only. Every office,</HI> religious, civil and military will be either their <HI>immediate gift,</HI> or it will come <HI>from them</HI> through the hands of <HI>their &s;ervants.</HI> And this, as ob&s;erved before, will be guaranteed to them under the &s;tate con&s;titutions which they re&s;pectively approve; for they <HI>cannot</HI> be royal forms, <HI>cannot</HI> be ari&s;tocratical, but <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be republican.</P>
<P>The people of tho&s;e &s;tates which have <HI>faithfully</HI> di&s;|charged their duty to the union will be no longer &s;ub|jected <HI>alone</HI> to the weight of <HI>the public debts.</HI> Proper ar|rangements will call forth the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> proportion of their &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, and our national character will <HI>again</HI> be as un&s;tained, <HI>as it was once exalted.</HI> Elevation to inde|pendence, <HI>with the lo&s;s of our good name,</HI> is only to be <HI>con&s;picuous in di&s;grace.</HI> The liberties of a people involved in debt are as <HI>uncertain</HI> as the liberty of an individual in the &s;ame &s;ituation. <HI>Their virtue is more precarious.</HI> The unfortunate citizen mu&s;t yield to the operation of the laws, while a bankrupt nation too ea&s;y annihi|lates <HI>the &s;acred obligations of gratitude and honor,</HI> and be|comes <HI>execrable and infamous.</HI> I cannot refrain from reminding my fellow-citizens of our <HI>near approach</HI> to that deplorable &s;ituation, which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be our mi&s;erable condition, if the defects of the old confederation re|main without amendment. The propo&s;ed con&s;titu|tion will cure the evil, and <HI>re&s;tore</HI> us to our rank among mankind.</P>
<P>Laws, made after the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact, have been a dreadful engine in the hands of tyrannical governors. Some of the mo&s;t virtuous and &s;hining characters in the world have been put to death, by laws <HI>formed to render them puni&s;hable,</HI> for parts of their conduct which <HI>innocence permitted,</HI> and to which <HI>pa|trioti&s;m impelled them.</HI> The&s;e have been called <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws, and are exploded by the new &s;y&s;tem. If a time of public contention &s;hall hereafter arrive,
<PB N="18" REF="021028_0018_0FB177DA2CED8E70"><HI>the firm and ardent friends to liberty</HI> may know the length to which they can pu&s;h their noble oppo&s;ition, on the foundation of the laws. Should their country's cau&s;e impel them further, they will be acquainted with the hazard, and u&s;ing tho&s;e arms which Providence has put into their hands, will make a &s;olemn appeal to <HI>"the power above."</HI></P>
<P>The de&s;truction of the ancient republics was occa&s;i|oned in every in&s;tance by their being ignorant of <HI>a great political po&s;ition, which was left for America to di&s;cover and e&s;tabli&s;h.</HI> Self-evident as the truth appears, we find no friend to liberty in ancient Greece or Rome a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>taxation and repre&s;entation were in&s;eparable.</HI> The Roman citizens, proud of their own liberty, im|po&s;ed, in the free&s;t times of the commonwealth, the mo&s;t grievous burdens on their wretched provinces. At other times we find thou&s;ands of their citizens, though re&s;iding within the walls of Rome, deprived of legi&s;lative repre&s;entatives. When America a&s;&s;ert|ed <HI>the novel truth,</HI> Great Britain, though boa&s;ting her|&s;elf as <HI>alone free</HI> among the modern nations, denied it by her legi&s;lature, and endeavoured to refute it by her arms&mdash;the rea&s;oning of tyrants. But the attempt was vain, for <HI>the voice of truth</HI> was heard above the thunders of the war, and <HI>reached the ears of all nations.</HI> Hence|forth the people of the earth will con&s;ider <HI>this po&s;ition</HI> as the <HI>only</HI> rock on which they can found the temple of liberty, <HI>that taxation and repre&s;entation are in&s;eparable.</HI> Our new con&s;titution carries it into execution on the mo&s;t enlarged and liberal &s;cale, for a Repre&s;entative will be cho&s;en by <HI>&s;ix thou&s;and of his</HI> fellow-citizens, a Sen|ator by <HI>half a &s;overeign &s;tate,</HI> a Pre&s;ident by a <HI>whole nation.</HI></P>
<P>The old foederal con&s;titution contained many of <HI>the &s;ame things,</HI> which from error or di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s are urged again&s;t the new one. <HI>Neither</HI> of them have a bill of rights, <HI>nor does either</HI> notice the liberty of the pre&s;s, becau&s;e they are already provided for <HI>by the
<PB N="19" REF="021028_0019_0FB177DBB46C45D8">&s;tate con&s;titutions;</HI> and relating only to <HI>per&s;onal</HI> rights, they could not be mentioned <HI>in a contract among &s;ove|reign &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P>Both the old and new foederal con&s;titutions, and indeed <HI>the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> admit of courts in which no u&s;e is made of a jury. The board of property, the court of admiralty, and the high court of errors and appeals, in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, as al&s;o the court of appeals under the old confedera|tion, exclude juries. <HI>Trial by jury will therefore be in the expre&s;s words of the Penn&s;ylvania con&s;titution, "as heretofore,"</HI>&mdash;almo&s;t always u&s;ed, though &s;ometimes omitted. Trials for lands lying in any &s;tate between per&s;ons re&s;iding in &s;uch &s;tate, for bonds, notes, book debts, contracts, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;umptions, and all other matters between two or more citizens of any &s;tate, will be held in the &s;tate courts by juries, <HI>as now.</HI> In the&s;e ca&s;es the foederal courts <HI>cannot interfere.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trials between a &s;tate and its own Citizens, and between Citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, involving que&s;tions concerning &s;tate laws that infringe this con&s;titution, may be carried by appeal, it is pre&s;umed, into a foederal court.</NOTE> But when a di&s;pute ari&s;es between the citizens of any &s;tate about lands lying out of the bounds <HI>thereof,</HI> or when a trial is to be had between the citizens of any &s;tate and tho&s;e of another, or the government of another, the private citizen will not be obliged to go into a court <HI>con&s;tituted by the &s;tate,</HI> with which, or with the citizens of which, <HI>his di&s;pute is. He can appeal to a di&s;intere&s;ted foederal court.</HI> This is &s;urely <HI>a great advan|tage,</HI> and promi&s;es a <HI>fair trial,</HI> and an <HI>impartial judg|ment.</HI> The trial by jury is <HI>not excluded</HI> in the&s;e foede|ral courts. In all <HI>criminal</HI> ca&s;es, where the property, liberty or life of the citizen is at &s;take, he has the be|nefit of a jury. If convicted on impeachment, which is never done by a jury in any country, he cannot be fined, impri&s;oned or puni&s;hed, but only may be <HI>di&s;|qualified</HI> from doing public mi&s;chief by lo&s;ing his office,
<PB N="20" REF="021028_0020_0FB177DD2BAC57F8">and his capacity to bold another. If the nature of his offence, be&s;ides its danger to his country, &s;hould be <HI>criminal</HI> in it&s;elf&mdash;&s;hould involve a charge of fraud, murder or trea&s;on&mdash;he may be tried for &s;uch crime, but cannot be convicted <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a jury.</HI> In trials about pro|perty in the foederal courts, which can only be <HI>as above &s;tated,</HI> there is nothing in the new con&s;titution <HI>to pre|vent a trial by jury.</HI> No doubt it will be the mode in every ca&s;e, wherein it is practicable. This will be adju&s;ted by law, and it could not be done otherwi&s;e. In &s;hort, the &s;phere of juri&s;diction for the foederal courts <HI>is limited,</HI> and that &s;phere only is &s;ubject to the regulations of our foederal government. The known principles of ju&s;tice, the attachment to trial by jury whenever it can be u&s;ed, the in&s;tructions of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, the in&s;tructions of the people at large, the operation of the foederal regulations on the pro|perty of a pre&s;ident, a &s;enator, a repre&s;entative, a judge, as well as on that of a private citizen, will certainly render tho&s;e regulations as favorable as po&s;|&s;ible to <HI>property; for life and liberty are put more than ever into the hands of the juries.</HI> Under the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> con|&s;titution of all the &s;tates, a public officer may be con|demned <HI>to impri&s;onment or death</HI> on impeachment, <HI>with|out a jury;</HI> but the new foederal con&s;titution protects the accu&s;ed, till he &s;hall be convicted, from the hands of power, by rendering <HI>a jury the indi&s;pen&s;ible judges of all crimes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>influence</HI> which <HI>foreign</HI> powers may attempt to exerci&s;e in our <HI>affairs</HI> was <HI>fore&s;een,</HI> and a whole&s;ome provi&s;ion <HI>has been made again&s;t it;</HI> for no per&s;on hold|ing an office under the United States is permitted to enjoy <HI>any foreign honors, powers or emoluments.</HI></P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ions of the people have been excited, perhaps by per&s;ons with good intentions, about the powers of the new government to rai&s;e an army. Let us con&s;ider this point with moderation and candor. As enemies will &s;ometimes in&s;ult us, invade our coun|try
<PB N="21" REF="021028_0021_0FB177E053632A50">and capture our property, it is clear a power in our government to oppo&s;e, re&s;train or de&s;troy them, is nece&s;&s;ary to our honor, &s;afety and exi&s;tence. The military &s;hould, however, be regarded <HI>with a watch|ful eye;</HI> for it is a profe&s;&s;ion that is liable to dangerous perver&s;ion. But the powers ve&s;ted in the foederal go|vernment <HI>do not go the length</HI> which has been &s;aid. <HI>A &s;tanding army is not granted or intended,</HI> for there can be no provi&s;ion for its continuing three years, much le&s;s for its <HI>permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> Two years are the ut|mo&s;t time for which the money can be given.

<P>Ob&s;ervations have been made on the power given to the foederal Government in regard to the elections of Repre&s;entatives and Senators. The regulations of the&s;e elections are, by the fir&s;t part of the clau&s;e, to be pre&s;cribed by the &s;tate legi&s;latures, <HI>who are certain|ly the proper bodies, if they will always execute the duty.</HI> But in ca&s;e the union or the public &s;afety &s;hould be <HI>endangered</HI> by an omi&s;&s;ion of this duty, as in the ca&s;e of Rhode-I&s;land, then the legi&s;lature of the United States can name for the people a convenient time, and do other matters nece&s;&s;ary <HI>to en&s;ure the free exer|ci&s;e of their right of election.</HI> The exception, in regard to the places of chu&s;ing <HI>Senators,</HI> was made from due re&s;pect to <HI>the &s;overeignty</HI> of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, who are to elect the Senators, and who&s;e place of meeting <HI>ought not to be pre&s;cribed to them by any authority,</HI> ex|cept indeed, as we always mu&s;t, <HI>by the authority of the people.</HI> This power given to the foederal legi&s;lature is no more than what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the governments of all the &s;tates.

It is well known, that in mo&s;t of the &s;tates the members of their Hou&s;es of Repre&s;en|tatives are cho&s;en in <HI>equal</HI> numbers from each county, and in the ea&s;tern &s;tates, in <HI>equal</HI> numbers from each town, <HI>without any regard</HI> to the number of taxable inhabitants, or the num|ber of &s;ouls. Hence it is very frequent for a county, with ten thou&s;and &s;ouls, to &s;end only the &s;ame number of members to the &s;tate hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, as a county with two thou|&s;and &s;ouls, by which each per&s;on in the lea&s;t populous county has <HI>five times as great a voice</HI> in electing repre&s;entatives, as his fellow citizen of the mo&s;t populous county. This is clearly <HI>a departure from the principles of equal liberty,</HI> and ought to be altered in the &s;everal &s;tates. I &s;peak the more plainly becau&s;e our &s;tate con&s;titution is free from that fault in the formation of our hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly. Now the new con&s;titution expre&s;sly declares, that the foederal Repre&s;entatives &s;hall be in the pro|portion of one to every thirty thou&s;and, which accords with rea&s;on and the true principles of liberty. This hou&s;e, there|fore, <HI>&s;o far as national matters go,</HI> will remedy the evil &s;pok|en of in the &s;everal &s;tates, and is one more <HI>great &s;tep</HI> towards the perfection of <HI>equal liberty</HI> and genuine <HI>republicani&s;m</HI> in Ame|rica.

<HEAD>SUBSTANCE OF AN ADDRESS TO A MEETING OF THE CITIZENS OF <HI>PHILADELPHIA:</HI> DELIVERED, OCTOBER SIXTH, MDCCLXXXVII, BY THE HONORABLE <HI>JAMES WILSON,</HI> ESQUIRE, ONE OF THE DELEGATES FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA TO THE LATE CONTI|NENTAL CONVENTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. CHAIRMAN and FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received the honour of an appoint|ment to repre&s;ent you in the late convention, it is, perhaps, my duty to comply with the reque&s;t of many gentlemen, who&s;e characters and judgments I &s;incerely re&s;pect, and who have urged that this would be a proper occa&s;ion to lay before you any information, which will &s;erve to elucidate and explain the principles and arrangements of the con|&s;titution
<PB N="26" REF="021028_0026_0FB177E7AC6F1F40">that has been &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the United States. I confe&s;s that I am unprepared for &s;o exten&s;ive and &s;o important a di&s;qui&s;ition: but the in&s;idious attempts, which are clande&s;tinely and indu&s;triou&s;ly made to pervert and de&s;troy the new plan, induce me the more readily to engage in its defence: and the impre&s;&s;ions of four months con&s;tant attend|ance to the &s;ubject, have not been &s;o ea&s;ily effaced, as to leave me without an an&s;wer to the objections which have been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>It will be proper, however, before I enter into the refutation of the charges that are alledged, to mark the leading di&s;crimination between the &s;tate con&s;titu|tions, and the con&s;titution of the United States. When the people e&s;tabli&s;hed the powers of legi&s;lation under their &s;eparate governments, they inve&s;ted their repre|&s;entatives with every right and authority which they did not in explicit terms re&s;erve: and therefore upon every que&s;tion, re&s;pecting the juri&s;diction of the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, if the frame of government is &s;ilent, the juri&s;diction is efficient and complete. But in de|legating foederal powers, another criterion was nece&s;|&s;arily introduced: and the congre&s;&s;ional authority is to be collected, not from tacit implication, but from the po&s;itive grant, expre&s;&s;ed in the in&s;trument of uni|on. Hence, it is evident, that in the former ca&s;e, every thing which is not re&s;erved, is given: but in the latter, the rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition prevails, and every thing which is not given, is re&s;erved. This di&s;tinction being recognized, will furni&s;h an an&s;wer to tho&s;e who think the omi&s;&s;ion of a bill of rights, a de|fect in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution: for it would have been &s;uperfluous and ab&s;urd, to have &s;tipulated with a foederal body of our own creation, that we &s;hould enjoy tho&s;e privileges, of which we are not dive&s;ted either by the intention or the act that has brought that body into exi&s;tence. For in&s;tance, the liberty of the
<PB N="27" REF="021028_0027_0FB177E92C4A6CB8">pre&s;s, which has been a copious &s;ubject of declamation and oppo&s;ition: what controul can proceed from the foederal government, to &s;hackle or de&s;troy that &s;acred palladium of national freedom? If, indeed, a power &s;imilar to that which has been granted for the regu|lation of commerce, had been granted to regulate li|terary publications, it would have been as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tipulate that the liberty of the pre&s;s &s;hould be pre|&s;erved inviolate, as that the impo&s;t &s;hould be general in its operation. With re&s;pect, likewi&s;e, to the par|ticular di&s;trict of ten miles, which is to be the &s;eat of government, it will undoubtedly be proper to ob&s;erve this &s;alutary precaution, as there the legi&s;lative pow|er will be ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident, &s;enate, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the United States. But this could not be an object with the convention: for it mu&s;t na|turally depend upon a future compact; to which the citizens immediately intere&s;ted, will, and ought to be parties: and there is no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;o popular a privilege will in that ca&s;e be neglected. In truth, then, the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no influence whatever upon the pre&s;s; and it would have been merely nugatory, to have introduced a formal decla|ration upon the &s;ubject: nay, that very declaration might have been con&s;trued to imply that &s;ome degree of power was given, &s;ince we undertook to define its extent.</P>
<P>Another objection that has been fabricated again&s;t the new con&s;titution, is expre&s;&s;ed in this di&s;ingenuous form&mdash;"the trial by jury is aboli&s;hed in civil ca&s;es." I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, my fellow citizens, if, upon this point, I take advantage of my profe&s;&s;ional experience, to detect the futility of the a&s;&s;ertion. Let it be re|membered, then, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the foederal con|vention was not local, but general&mdash;not limited to the views and e&s;tabli&s;hments of a &s;ingle &s;tate, but co-ex|ten&s;ive with the continent, and comprehending the
<PB N="28" REF="021028_0028_0FB177EACD35CE30">views and e&s;tabli&s;hments of thirteen independant &s;o|vereignties. When, therefore, this &s;ubject was in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, we were involved in difficulties, which pre&s;|&s;ed on all &s;ides, and no precedent could be di&s;covered to direct our cour&s;e. The ca&s;es open to a jury, dif|fered in the different &s;tates: it was therefore imprac|ticable, on that ground, to have made a general rule. The want of uniformity would have rendered any re|ference to the practice of the &s;tates idle and u&s;ele&s;s: and it could not, with any propriety, be &s;aid, that "the trial by jury &s;hall be as heretofore:" &s;ince there has never exi&s;ted any foederal &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, to which the declaration could relate. Be&s;ides, it is not in all ca&s;es that the trial by jury is adopted in ci|vil que&s;tions: for cau&s;es depending in courts of ad|miralty, &s;uch as relate to maritime captures, and &s;uch as are agitated in the courts of equity, do not require the intervention of that tribunal. How, then, was the line of di&s;crimination to be drawn? The con|vention found the ta&s;k too difficult for them: and they left the bu&s;ine&s;s as it &s;tands&mdash;in the fulle&s;t confidence, that no danger could po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue, &s;ince the proceed|ings of the &s;upreme court are to be regulated by the congre&s;s, which is a faithful repre&s;entation of the people: and the oppre&s;&s;ion of government is effectu|ally barred, by declaring that in all criminal ca&s;es, the trial by jury &s;hall be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>This con&s;titution, it has been further urged, is of a pernicious tendency, becau&s;e it tolerates a &s;tanding army in the time of peace. This has always been a popular topic of declamation: and yet I do not know a nation in the world, which has not found it nece&s;|&s;ary and u&s;eful to maintain the appearance of &s;trength in a &s;ea&s;on of the mo&s;t profound tranquility. Nor is it a novelty with us; for under the pre&s;ent articles of confederation, congre&s;s certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this repro|bated power: and the exerci&s;e of it is proved at this
<PB N="29" REF="021028_0029_0FB177EC2C05E9A8">moment by the cantonments along the banks of the Ohio. But what would be our national &s;ituation, where it otherwi&s;e? Every principle of policy mu&s;t be &s;ubverted, and the government mu&s;t declare war before they are prepared to carry it on. Whatever may be the provocation, however important the ob|ject in view, and however nece&s;&s;ary di&s;patch and &s;e|crecy may be, &s;till the declaration mu&s;t precede the preparation, and the enemy will be informed of your intention, not only before you are equipped for an attack, but even before you are fortified for a defence. The con&s;equence is too obvious to require any further delineation; and no man, who regards the dignity and &s;afety of his country, can deny the nece&s;&s;ity of a military force, under the controul, and with the re|&s;trictions which the new con&s;titution provides.</P>
<P>Perhaps there never was a charge made with le&s;s rea&s;on, than that which predicts the in&s;titution of a baneful ari&s;tocracy in the foederal &s;enate. This body branches into two characters, the one legi&s;lative, and the other executive. In its legi&s;lative character, it can effect no purpo&s;e without the co-operation of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives: and in its executive charac|ter, it can accompli&s;h no object, without the concur|rence of the pre&s;ident. Thus fettered, I do not know any act which the &s;enate can of it&s;elf perform: and &s;uch dependence nece&s;&s;arily precludes every idea of influence and &s;uperiority. But I will confe&s;s, that in the organization of this body, a compromi&s;e between contending intere&s;ts is di&s;cernible: and when we re|flect how various are the laws, commerce, habits, population, and extent of the confederated &s;tates, this evidence of mutual conce&s;&s;ion and accommodation ought rather to command a generous applau&s;e, than to excite jealou&s;y and reproach. For my part, my admiration can only be equalled by my a&s;toni&s;hment, in beholding &s;o perfect a &s;y&s;tem formed from &s;uch he|terogeneous materials.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="021028_0030_0FB177EF6BB45AC0">
The next accu&s;ation I &s;hall con&s;ider, is that which repre&s;ents the foederal con&s;titution as not only calcu|lated, but de&s;ignedly framed, to reduce the &s;tate go|vernments to mere corporations, and eventually to annihilate them. Tho&s;e who have employed the term corporation, upon this occa&s;ion, are not perhaps aware of its extent. In common parlance, indeed, it is ge|nerally applied to petty a&s;&s;ociations for the ea&s;e and conveniency of a few individuals; but in its enlarged &s;en&s;e, it will comprehend the government of Penn|&s;ylvania, the exi&s;ting union of the &s;tates, and even this projected &s;y&s;tem is nothing more than a formal act of incorporation. But upon what pretence can it be alledged that it was de&s;igned to annihilate the &s;tate governments? For, I will undertake to prove that upon their exi&s;tence depends the exi&s;tence of the foederal plan. For this purpo&s;e, permit me to call your attention to the manner in which the pre&s;ident, &s;enate, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, are propo&s;ed to be appointed. The pre&s;ident is to be cho&s;en by elec|tors, nominated in &s;uch manner as the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate may direct; &s;o that if there is no legi&s;la|ture, there can be no &s;enate. The hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives is to be compo&s;ed of members cho&s;en every &s;econd year by the people of the &s;everal &s;tates, and the electors in each &s;tate &s;hall have the qualifications requi&s;ite to electors of the mo&s;t numerous branch of the &s;tate legi&s;lature&mdash;unle&s;s, therefore, there is a &s;tate legi&s;lature, that qualification cannot be a&s;certained, and the popular branch of the foederal con&s;titution mu&s;t likewi&s;e be extinct. From this view, then, it is evidently ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the annihilation of the &s;eparate governments will re&s;ult from their union; or, that, having that intention, the authors of the new &s;y&s;tem would have bound their connection with &s;uch indi&s;&s;oluble ties. Let me here advert to an arrange|ment highly advantageous; for you will perceive, with|out
<PB N="31" REF="021028_0031_0FB177F0F5B150C8">prejudice to the powers of the legi&s;lature in the election of &s;enators, the people at large will acquire an additional privilege in returning members to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives&mdash;whereas, by the pre&s;ent con|federation, it is the legi&s;lature alone that appoints the delegates to congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The power of direct taxation has likewi&s;e been treated as an improper delegation to the foederal go|vernment; but when we con&s;ider it as the duty of that body to provide for the national &s;afety, to &s;upport the dignity of the union, and to di&s;charge the debts contracted upon the collective faith of the &s;tates, for their common benefit, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that tho&s;e, upon whom &s;uch important obligations are impo&s;ed, ought, in ju&s;tice and in policy, to po&s;&s;e&s;s eve|ry means requi&s;ite for a faithful performance of their tru&s;t. But why &s;hould we be alarmed with vi&s;ionary evils? I will venture to predict, that the great reve|nue of the United States mu&s;t, and always will, be rai&s;ed by impo&s;t; for, being at once le&s;s obnoxious, and more productive, the intere&s;t of the government will be be&s;t promoted by the accommodation of the peo|ple. Still, however, the object of direct taxation &s;hould be within reach in all ca&s;es of emergency; and there is no more rea&s;on to apprehend oppre&s;&s;ion in the mode of collecting a revenue from this re&s;ource, than in the form of an impo&s;t, which, by univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent, is le&s;t to the authority of the foederal government. In either ca&s;e, the force of civil con&s;titutions will be ade|quate to the purpo&s;e; and the dread of military vio|lence, which has been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly di&s;&s;eminated, mu&s;t eventually prove the mere effu&s;ion of a wild imagi|nation, or a factious &s;pirit. But the &s;alutary con&s;e|quences that mu&s;t flow from thus enabling the govern|ment to relieve and &s;upport the credit of the union, will afford another an&s;wer to the objections upon this ground. The &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, particularly,
<PB N="32" REF="021028_0032_0FB177F27A844150">which has encumbered it&s;elf with the a&s;&s;umption of a great proportion of the public debt, will derive con|&s;iderable relief and advantage; for, as it was the im|becility of the pre&s;ent confederation, which gave ri&s;e to the funding law, that law mu&s;t naturally expire, when a complete and energetic foederal &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be &s;ub&s;tituted&mdash;the &s;tate will then be di&s;charged from an extraordinary burden, and the national creditor will find it to be his intere&s;t to return to his original &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>After all, my fellow-citizens, it is neither extraor|dinary nor unexpected, that the con&s;titution offered to your con&s;ideration, &s;hould meet with oppo&s;ition. It is the nature of man to pur&s;ue his own intere&s;t, in preference to the public good; and I do not mean to make any per&s;onal reflection, when I add, that it is the intere&s;t of a very numerous, powerful, and re|&s;pectable body, to counteract and de&s;troy the excellent work produced by the late convention. All the offi|cers of government, and all the appointments for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and the collection of the pub|lic revenue, which are transferred from the individu|al to the aggregate &s;overeignty of the &s;tates, will ne|ce&s;&s;arily turn the &s;tream of influence and emolument into a new channel. Every per&s;on, therefore, who ei|ther enjoys, or expects to enjoy a place of profit un|der the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, will object to the pro|po&s;ed innovation? not, in truth, becau&s;e it is injuri|ous to the liberties of his country, but becau&s;e it ef|fects his &s;chemes of wealth and con&s;equence. I will confe&s;s, indeed, that I am not a blind admirer of this plan of government, and that there are &s;ome parts of it, which, if my wi&s;h had prevailed, would certainly have been altered. But, when I reflect how widely men differ in their opinions, and that every man (and the ob&s;ervation applies likewi&s;e to every &s;tate) has an equal preten&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert his own, I am &s;atisfied that
<PB N="33" REF="021028_0033_0FB177F3B9F83D90">any thing nearer to perfection could not have been ac|compli&s;hed. If there are errors, it &s;hould be remem|bered, that the &s;eeds of reformation are &s;own in the work it&s;elf, and the concurrence of two thirds of the congre&s;s may at any time introduce alterations and amendments. Regarding it, then, in every point of view, with a candid and di&s;intere&s;ted mind, I am bold to a&s;&s;ert, that it is the BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS EVER BEEN OFFERED TO THE WORLD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The candid Reader will &s;uppo&s;e Mr. WILSON here means, that it is the be&s;t form of <HI>foederal</HI> government, which has ever been offered to the world&mdash;and it is &s;urely true that the <HI>foederal</HI> con&s;titution, con&s;idered in due connexion with the &s;tate con|&s;titutions, is the be&s;t form of government that has ever been communicated to mankind.</NOTE></P>
