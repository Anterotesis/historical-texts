<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN III. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The &s;ame came to <HI>JESUS</HI> by Night&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are &s;poken of <HI>Nico|demus,</HI> a Man of Honour and Au|thority among the Jews, and &s;e|cretly a Di&s;ciple of our Lord JESUS. <HI>The &s;ame came to</HI> JESUS <HI>by Night,</HI> to hear about his Soul, and the My&s;teries of the Kingdom. 'Twas <HI>Nicodemus</HI>'s Fault that he feared to profe&s;s CHRIST openly; that he cho&s;e the Darkne&s;s to approach him undi&s;covered: But it was his Hap|pine&s;s that he came at all; and it was in|finite Compa&s;&s;ion in our Lord that he accepted the cowardly Vi&s;it, and in&s;tructed the weak, but &s;incere Di&s;ciple. I &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="004685_0004_100DE544F278C2D8">be glad if the Arguments brought by &s;ome to vindicate <HI>Nicodemus</HI> from the Imputa|tion of Cowardize in this Vi&s;it, were of more Significance. The Words are big with Entertainment and In&s;truction: And from the various Hints which they afford us, I propo&s;e to give you an u&s;eful and brief Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ame came to</HI> JESUS. The DOC|TRINE is, That <HI>for us to come to</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is our Intere&s;t and our Duty.</HI></P>
<P>It is our <HI>Duty.</HI> So <HI>Nicodemus</HI> was con|vinced, when he made his &s;erious Ap|proach. He was convinced that he was the great Teacher come from GOD. And therefore he knew that he ought to wait upon him for In&s;truction and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>And as this was the Duty of <HI>Nicodemus</HI> in his Day, &s;o it is no le&s;s ours at this Di&s;tance. We are under the &s;ame Ob|ligations, and our Lord JESUS is &s;till the &s;ame Prophet and Teacher that he was then. Indeed we cannot go to CHRIST as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did, and have the Plea&s;ure and the &s;acred Curo&s;ity to hear from his Lips the divine Language. He is now gone to his Father, and is no more
<PB N="7" REF="004685_0005_100DE5467574F790">vi&s;ible on Earth. But yet have we his Spirit to lead us into all Truth: and they are His In&s;tructions, which the Spirit gives us. And we are equally obliged to repair to him now for this &s;piritual In&s;truction as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> of old. Joh. xvi. 7,&mdash;14. <HI>It is expedient for you that I go awny: For if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will &s;end him unto you.&mdash;He &s;hall receive of mine, and &s;hall &s;hew it unto you.</HI> CHRIST then &s;peaks as much to us by his Spirit, as if we &s;aw his Face, and heard his Voice, as they did when he was upon Earth. And we are as much obliged to attend the gentle Whi&s;pers and obey them. In every di|vine In&s;titution we are to &s;eek that we may find him.</P>
<P>And as this is our Duty, &s;o it is our <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> too. <HI>Nicodemus</HI> found it &s;o when he came de&s;irous to learn, and went home in&s;tructed, wi&s;e unto Salvation. Our Duty and our Intere&s;t are in&s;eperably linked to|gether, by the Law of Nature, and the GOD of Heaven. Heaven and eternal Happine&s;s will be the future Reward of our Obedience to the divine Commands: Nor is this all, nor &s;hall we wait &s;o long for a Recompence; for they carry their
<PB N="8" REF="004685_0006_100DE548C7C92DE8">own Wages in them, and <HI>IN keeping of them there is great Reward.</HI> The believing, humble Soul, that comes to JESUS CHRIST, &s;hall find a ble&s;&s;ed Peace and Satisfaction attending, and &s;ucceeding the &s;acred La|bour. A divine Ea&s;e, and Relief of Mind, will be the &s;weet Con&s;equence of a Vi&s;it to JESUS. Matth. xi. 28, 29. <HI>Come unto me all ye that Labour, and are heavy la|den, and I will give you Re&s;t &mdash; and ye &s;hall find Re&s;t unto your Souls.</HI> This then is the <HI>Fir&s;t Doctrine</HI> ob&s;ervable in the Words: and happy if we obey it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Exhortation</HI> here is, <HI>Let us come to</HI> JESUS CHRIST, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> in the Text; <HI>and be incouraged by the Reception he found.</HI> Let us pray for the Holy Spirit to in&s;truct us in the My&s;teries of Godline&s;s; and be afraid to grieve and &s;in away his Influen|ces. Whenever we find the ble&s;&s;ed Spi|rit at work upon us, let us cheri&s;h the holy Thoughts, and labour to keep them alive in us. We mu&s;t find a Time every Day for Retirement to <HI>pray</HI> for this, and the better to <HI>attend</HI> to it. <HI>If we &s;eek him he will be found of us, but if we for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t us off forever.</HI> He has &s;aid, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man.</HI> And <HI>woe to us if he depart from us.</HI> Nay,
<PB N="9" REF="004685_0007_100DE54AD48BA8A8">he has <HI>limited it to a certain Day; where|fore, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, har|den not your Heart,</HI> le&s;t <HI>he &s;wear in</HI> his <HI>Wrath ye &s;hall not enter into his Re&s;t. Be|hold now is the accepted Time, behold now is the Day of Salvation. E&s;cape for thy Life this Night, for to morrow thou &s;halt be &s;lain.</HI> And now does the Saviour incourage our Labours, <HI>I love them that love me, and they that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me. Nicode|mus</HI> went to CHRIST in Body; but we cannot. He is gone away above our a&s;|pectable Skies: And <HI>where he is gone, thi|ther we cannot come,</HI> till Death &s;hall give us Wings to <HI>fly as the Eagles towards Heaven.</HI> But though we cannot approach in Per&s;on to his bodily Pre&s;ence, yet we can come to him as truly and as effectu|ally as <HI>Nicodemus.</HI> Let us then do &s;o, by <HI>Repentance, Faith, Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed to another main Branch of the Text: <HI>The &s;ame came to</HI> JESUS <HI>by Night.</HI> The DOCTRINE is, <HI>No Sea&s;on is improper or un&s;uitable for our &s;olemn Ap|proach to</HI> JESUS CHRIST. Our Lord accepted and rewarded the Vi&s;it of <HI>Nico|demus,</HI> though he cho&s;e the Night to be|friend his Cowardi&s;e, and came in the un|&s;ea&s;onable Hours of Darkne&s;s. Tired and
<PB N="10" REF="004685_0008_100DE54D258600B8">&s;pent as our LORD was won't to be with the Affairs of the Day, he &s;ent not the feeble Di&s;ciple from him, but redeemed Time from his natural Re&s;t, to di&s;cour&s;e with, enlighten and in&s;truct him. That <HI>we</HI> may reap the Benefit of this Pa&s;&s;age in &s;acred Record, I have formed this <HI>Doctrine</HI> for you, <HI>That at every Sea&s;on we are wel|come to our</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no Sea&s;on improper for us in which to <HI>believe</HI> on JESUS CHRIST: that is, to come to him by Faith. Faith in JESUS CHRIST is the great Doctrine of the Go&s;pel. And as it is to be preach|ed to all Nations; to all Men, in every Place, &s;o at every Sea&s;on too: <HI>In Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on</HI> And the Practice is like the preaching: it &s;hould be univer|&s;al in Time, Place and Per&s;on. The younge&s;t is not too young for this, nor the elde&s;t too old. The fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay at Under|&s;tanding and Will &s;hould be employed in believing on CHRIST, and the Acts &s;hould be continued and repeated to the late&s;t Ga&s;p of Breath. Tho&s;e who have never yet &s;avingly complied with the Offers of the Go&s;pel, are obliged to do it now: So long as you have an Inclination to do it, you may &s;afely conclude the Sea&s;on for it
<PB N="11" REF="004685_0009_100DE5506F72E960">is not over. In every various Circum|&s;tance of Life: In the Sun&s;hine of Pro&s;|perity, or in the Gloom of Affliction, like <HI>Nicodemus</HI> in the Night, Faith in JESUS CHRIST is your Duty, and &s;hould be your Practice.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no Sea&s;on improper for us in which to come to CHRIST by <HI>Repen|tance.</HI> The Di&s;cour&s;e between <HI>Nicode|mus</HI> and our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in the Night, turned upon Repentance and Conver&s;ion. They were the my&s;terious Doctrines of Regeneration which were the Subject of Debate between our LORD and the young Di&s;ciple. It naturally, methinks, leads our Thoughts to this, that the mo&s;t improper Sea&s;on is &s;till proper for our Con|cern about Repentance and the New-Birth. This be&s;ure was the Sentiment of the P&s;almi&s;t, when he thought that the Night was better improved in devoting him&s;elf to GOD, than in the &s;oft Refre&s;h|ment of Slumber and Sleep. P&s;al. cxxxii. 4. <HI>I will not give Sleep to my Eyes, nor Slumber to my Eye-lids, till I find out a Place for the</HI> LORD, <HI>an Habitation for the mighty GOD of Jacob.</HI> 'Tis dangerous delaying one Night.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="004685_0010_100DE552F51CF068">
3. There is no Sea&s;on improper in which to come to CHRIST by <HI>Prayer.</HI> Prayer is a coming to GOD, and to CHRIST who is GOD. 'Tis called a <HI>drawing near</HI> to him; and a <HI>&s;eaking</HI> him; and <HI>coming before him. They that be far from thee &s;hall peri&s;h: But it is good for me to</HI> DRAW NEAR <HI>to GOD. O that I knew where I might</HI> FIND HIM, <HI>that I could</HI> COME NEAR <HI>even to his Seat, I would order my Cau&s;e before him, and fill my Mouth with Arguments. Let my Prayer</HI> COME BEFORE <HI>thee as Incen&s;e, and the lifting up of my Hands as the Evening Sa|crifice</HI> And as Prayer is a coming to CHRIST, and to GOD the Father by him, &s;o this Way of &s;acred Acce&s;s is ne|ver impertinent or un&s;ea&s;onable. We are commanded to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing:</HI> To <HI>pray always with all Prayer.</HI> We are in|couraged that <HI>the Ears of the LORD are always open to our Prayer;</HI> and that the <HI>Prayer of the upright is his Delight.</HI> Even in the darke&s;t Times we are allowed to pray. Nay the darker the Sea&s;on, the more nece&s;&s;ary the Prayer. <HI>Is any afflicted? Let him pray. Nicodemus</HI> in the Darkne&s;s of the Night; and <HI>Jonah</HI> in the Darkne&s;s of his Affliction, and in the Belly of Hell, may both alike approach to GOD. &mdash; <HI>WATCH and pray.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="13" REF="004685_0011_100DE5554E8331D8">
4. There is no Sea&s;on improper for us in which to come to CHRIST by <HI>Meditation.</HI> In our Thoughts we may travel from Earth to Heaven in a Moment. Our Souls may approach to CHRIST, in the Twinkling of an Eye. We have no need, like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> to wait for the Night for this: But a thou&s;and Times every Day we may lift our Thoughts to Heaven. So was the Law of GOD &s;weet, to the devout P&s;almi&s;t; and his <HI>Meditation all the Day.</HI> Night as well as Day, this was his dear and happy Em|ployment. <HI>In it does he meditate Day and Night.</HI> So <HI>I&s;aac went out to meditate in the Field at Even Tide.</HI> Thro' the dark and &s;olitary Hours of the Night, holy Contem|plation may find us &s;weet Employment. P&s;al. lxiii. 5, 6. <HI>My Soul &s;hall be &s;atisfied&mdash; when I remember thee on my Bed, and medi|tate on the in the Night Watches.</HI> Not <HI>Nicodemus</HI> him&s;elf &s;itting at the Feet of JE|SUS, might conceive diviner Satisfaction! The Believer conver&s;ing with his LORD in holy Contemplations, amid&s;t the Shades and Darkne&s;s, has Light ari&s;ing in his Dark|ne&s;s. He may triumph in the Glooms and the Solitude, and rai&s;e his <HI>Songs in the Night.</HI></P>
<P>And to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Meditations in the Night, &s;ee how full of <HI>Subjects</HI> the holy Scriptures appear, to cultivate and adorn
<PB N="14" REF="004685_0012_100DE557B51B7580">the Work. How many wonderful Tran&s;|actions have happened in this Sea&s;on, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Shades and render the Night glorious. Should we, like <HI>Aba&s;uerus,</HI> lin|ger through the Night without the Com|fort of a Slumber, we have nobler Records than of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to entertain and delight our Thoughts. Let us reflect back upon the &s;acred Pages on &s;uch Scenes as the&s;e, as the Night &s;lowly &s;lides away, and the Morning forgets to dawn. So let us, like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> pay a Vi&s;it to our LORD by Night. This is the be&s;t Way not to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> Nights <HI>of Vanity,</HI> when it may be <HI>weari&s;ome Nights are appointed unto us.</HI> Why need we &s;ay, <HI>Would GOD it were Morning! In Evening Time it &s;hall be Light. The Night &s;hall be Light round about me, and the Darkne&s;s &s;hall &s;hine as the Day.</HI></P>
<P>What a glorious Night was it when our Father <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;eized the &s;trugling Angel, and wre&s;ted the Ble&s;&s;ing from his Gra&s;p?</P>
<P>How &s;olemn and memorable was the Night, in the Mixture of Salvation and Ruin, which in&s;tituted the ancient Pa&s;&s;|over? GOD marched through the Dark|ne&s;s; and the Pe&s;tilence &s;talked before him: Round about all the Fir&s;t-born gave a Ga&s;p, and &s;tretched out Breathle&s;s: While the De&s;troyer &s;aw the Blood upon the &s;prink|led
<PB N="15" REF="004685_0013_100DE55A14876EA0">Door-Po&s;ts, &amp; &s;miled and pa&s;&s;ed over: A <HI>Night much to be remembred throughout all Generations.</HI></P>
<P>How illu&s;trious was the fatal Night, which poured the Red-Sea upon the Ar|mies of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and landed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> on the oppo&s;ite Shore. With what a terrible Magnificence might you then have &s;een the <HI>Shekinah</HI> blaze through the Ranks of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and confound <HI>Pharaoh</HI> with its tre|mendious Gloom? Before, the Waves broke, divided, and fled away in ha&s;te, to open a Path for the favourite People: Be|hind, they to&s;t, and foam'd, and roar'd; they watched the Signal from the Rod of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and ru&s;h'd thundring down.</P>
<P>'Twas in the Night that the Angel was commi&s;&s;ioned again&s;t the Ho&s;t of <HI>A&s;&s;yria.</HI> He fla&s;h'd out &s;wift as a Ray of Light, &s;i|lent as a lambent Flame, but refi&s;tle&s;s and di&s;tructive as the feather'd Lightning. An hundred and four&s;core and five Thou&s;and Souls were lick'd up in a Moment; and the Field look'd pale with Corp&s;es. What a di&s;mal Night did the whole World lie in, till the Go&s;pel &s;pread its Light, and the <HI>Day-Star aro&s;e. They &s;at in Darkne&s;s and &s;aw no Light.</HI> O the wondrous Night that gave the Saviour to the peri&s;hing Earth! O the Glories of that illu&s;trious Hour!
<PB N="16" REF="004685_0014_100DE55C6FC9D748">'Twas to you, ye admiring Shepherds, that the heavenly Me&s;&s;enger brought the joy|ful Tydings! They were watching their Flocks in the Night, when, all on a &s;ud|den, a Light broke from Heaven round the Mountains, and the Voice of <HI>Gabriel</HI> pro|claimed the Saviour born. Then was heard the Mu&s;ick of Paradi&s;e tuneful round the Sky; and <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highe&s;t,</HI> trembled on a Million of Strings.</P>
<P>'Twas on the fatal Night <HI>(&mdash;that &s;ame Night in which he was betrayed&mdash;)</HI> that he &s;at retired in the upper Chamber with the Twelve, and in&s;tituted for us the &s;acred Supper, the dear Memorials of his dying Love.</P>
<P>A few dark Hours after you might have &s;een him lie in his bitter Agony, bleeding on the Ground, praying and weeping, with the <HI>Cup of trembling</HI> in his Hand: The dear JESUS, who had &s;pent &s;o many Nights in Prayer to GOD!</P>
<P>'Twas the &s;ame execrable Night (but ble&s;&s;ed Hours for us) that they came to &s;eize him with Lanthorns and Torches; and poured upon him Indignities and Torments.</P>
<P>The <HI>next Day</HI> there was a <HI>miraculous Night</HI> while there was Darkne&s;s over the whole Land, and the mourning Skies were hung in black at the Angui&s;h of his Crucifixion.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004685_0015_100DE55E033F0E00">
The Night after, he lay, a pale, bloody Corps, among the awful Man&s;ions of the dead. And what a proper Meditation does this naturally lead us to, on our own Death and Grave?</P>
<P>In the Night, how ea&s;y may be the Tran|&s;ition of Thoughts, to that long Darkne&s;s between us and the Re&s;urrection: That refre&s;hing Sleep in the Du&s;t, which CHRIST has con&s;ecrated for us, and will rai&s;e us from. <HI>A Land of Darkne&s;s, as Darkne&s;s it &s;elf, who&s;e Light is as Darkne&s;s.</HI> But O ble&s;&s;ed Dawn after the long Darkne&s;s! The Me|ditation may tran&s;port us; and like <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> we may rai&s;e our Voice of Har|mony and Prai&s;e in all the Terrors of the hideous Night. <HI>Are there not twelve Hours in a Day, let us work while the Day la&s;ts, for the Night cometh wherein no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>But to draw toward a Clo&s;e. Let us often redeem our Hours in the Night, to meditate upon that di&s;mal, glorious Hour, when our LORD &s;hall come again. <HI>Behold he cometh as a Thief in the Night. At Midnight will the Cry be heard;</HI> and a general Horror run through every human Brea&s;t. Now &s;hall the Shades &s;catter away, and the Hea|vens glitter with an unknown Glory. O tremendious Night! O awful Shades and
<PB N="18" REF="004685_0016_100DE56081A4F5A0">Darkne&s;s, di&s;pell'd by devouring Fire, and pur&s;ued by dazling De&s;truction! And who can &s;ay when this &s;olemn Scene of Things mu&s;t come on? Perhaps this Night; perhaps all on a &s;udden the Judge may break in upon the &s;ecure World. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know not the Day, nor the Hour; whether at Even, or at Midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</HI></P>
<P>But, to add no more: In the Night, how naturally may we transfer our Thot's to the Place of Darkne&s;s: The Hell pre|pared for wicked Men and devils. Here is a Night without any Hope of a Morning to end it; or a &s;ingle Ray of Light to re|fre&s;h it. A Night con&s;i&s;ting of Darkne&s;s and Fire: But as the Fire affords them no Light, the Darkne&s;s allows them no Re&s;t. And as the Volume of Revelation affords us Matter for Contemplation in the Night, &s;o al&s;o does the Volume of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>See the dark Earth and the du&s;ky Skies, brightened by Star-light, or &s;ilver'd over by Moon&s;hine: And when ye &s;ee the blue Ether; the Stars twinkle at a Di&s;tance; and the Moon, the fair Empre&s;s of the &s;ilent Shades, &s;erenely gleeming, reflect in|ward and &s;ay, LORD, <HI>when I behold the Heavens, the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou ha&s;t ordained;
<PB N="19" REF="004685_0017_100DE562DB1712E8">what is Man, that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of Man that thou vi&s;it&s;t him?</HI></P>
<P>Think too on the kind <HI>Providence</HI> that pre&s;erves you every Night. The <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> may <HI>walk in Darkne&s;s</HI> innocently by me, and I am <HI>not afraid of the Terror by Night.</HI> I lie down in Peace &amp; &s;leep: I awake, for the LORD &s;u&s;tained me. His holy Mini&s;ters attend my Curtains and guard my Slum|bers. <HI>There &s;tood by me this Night, the An|gel of GOD who&s;e I am, and whom I &s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>It were ea&s;y, you &s;ee, to enlarge; and to add many other pertinent To|picks for Meditation in the dark Hours, by which, like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> we might come to JESUS by Night: But here I &s;hall &s;top.</P>
<P>I might add a third Doctrine. That <HI>Fear in a good Cau&s;e is a di&s;hononourable Thing.</HI> 'Twas <HI>Nicodemus's</HI> Weakne&s;s that he came to our LORD by Night. He was afraid of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and a&s;hamed of Reproach and Per&s;ecution: and it is re|corded to all Generations, as a Blemi&s;h upon the good Man's Character. We learn by it not to be like him in this: Never to be a&s;hamed in a good Cau&s;e, or afraid to profe&s;s it openly. Though we are not to be o&s;tentatious in Religion, yet we are never to be a&s;hamed of it. We mu&s;t <HI>let our Light &s;hine before others.</HI> There is
<PB N="20" REF="004685_0018_100DE565F9997008">a happy Medium betwixt Impudence and Ba&s;hfulne&s;s: and as they are <HI>both</HI> ill-breed|ing in civil Life, &s;o they are <HI>both</HI> dete&s;tible in Religion. But I &s;hall not enlarge here. I could not have done Ju&s;tice to my Text without hinting at this; I have done it the rather, becau&s;e this is a Crime too common, e&s;pecially among young People, to be a&s;ha|med in Matters of Religion. Things that are mo&s;t worthy and honourable they per|form with a mo&s;t awkward Air, and are willing to put the amiable Name of Mode&s;ty upon this ungraceful Blu&s;h. Mode&s;ty, it is true, is very charming: but a Shame in Mat|ters of Religion, is da&s;tardly and clowni&s;h, and far from this fine and delicate Temper. There is as much Difference between Mo|de&s;ty and Ba&s;hfulne&s;s as between Courage and Frenzy. Fortitude the Virtue of an Angel; Ra&s;hne&s;s the Rage of a Brute. How mean is it for a Per&s;on, educated in a Chri&s;ti|an Land, to be a&s;ham'd to pray in a Family, or a&s;k a Ble&s;&s;ing at a Table; a&s;hamed of what my Brother!&mdash; to acknowledge thy Maker! So that while a hypocrital Showy|ne&s;s is to be avoided, yet on the other Hand we are to remember, that our LORD has &s;aid, <HI>He that is a&s;hamed of me &amp; of my Words before Men, of him will I be a&s;hamed before my Father who is in Heaven. Nicodemus</HI> was
<PB N="21" REF="004685_0019_100DE03525297550">changed from this coward Temper, uponhis under&s;tanding what the New-Birth meant: And went afterward and boldly honoured the dead Body of JESUS. <HI>Joh.</HI> xix. 39.</P>
<P>Thus I have fini&s;hed the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> hand|ling of the Words. I &s;hall now conclude with a brief Improvement of the <HI>Second Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>Is it as we have heard? Did <HI>Nicodemus</HI> come to JESUS by Night? And does it preach to us our Duty to approach to our LORD at every Sea&s;on? Let us then <HI>receive the Word of Exhortation,</HI> &amp; practice the Duty. Let us wait upon the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Day and Night, and his Prai&s;e be continually in our Mouth. In our darke&s;t Hours let this refre&s;h us, and brighten all the Shades: In every Affliction, and every Temptation, and every Darkne&s;s; in every Day, and the Gloom of every Night. Let us u&s;e our&s;elves to the noble Comfort; and &s;o learn Expert|ne&s;s in it. Let us furni&s;h our Minds with innumerable Subjects pertinent for Contem|plation in every Kind of Darkne&s;s. And let us repair to CHRIST as <HI>the Sun of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s: A Light unto the Gentiles,</HI> and <HI>the Glory of his People I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>This, I hope, has been your intent at this Sea&s;on. CHRIST has met you in this Di&s;|cour&s;e: and like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> you have come
<PB N="22" REF="004685_0020_100DE5699A05C228">to him by Night: O may you go away en|lightned &amp; renewed as he did. Happy will this Night then be, memorable &amp; ble&s;&s;ed; and with Joy will you look back upon it through the Ages of eternal Day.</P>
<P>But, my Brethren, if you refu&s;e and rebel, at your own Peril be it. Better had you not come hither this Night, than going away, continue Strangers to CHRIST. The gol|den Opportunities will become a Cur&s;e: and the higher your pre&s;ent Privileges are the deeper will be your future Fall: Even from this Sermon you'll &s;ink but the lower into Ruin. So while <HI>Paul continued his Speech till Midnight,</HI> the &s;leepy <HI>Eutychus</HI> fell headlong <HI>from the third Lo&s;t, and was taken up dead,</HI> Act. xx. 8, 9. From &s;ucceeding Days and Nights here upon Earth, you mu&s;t quickly be bani&s;hed to perpetual Night; to <HI>Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s for ever:</HI> The <HI>outer Darkne&s;s,</HI> where is <HI>weeping and wailing and gna&s;hiug of Teeth.</HI> And <HI>in Chains under Darkne&s;s, you'll be re&s;erved to the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> This mu&s;t be your Con|dition quickly: How quickly you cannot &s;ay. <HI>The Day goeth away, the Shadows of the Evening are &s;tretched out. Thon Fool, this Night may thy Soul be required of thee.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand: If you will indeed be per&s;waded truly to come to CHRIST,
<PB N="23" REF="004685_0021_100DE56F301445F8">you will find the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Succe&s;s &amp; Joy. At pre&s;ent you'll come to him in the Night: <HI>The Darkne&s;s of this World:</HI> But in a little Time the dark Minutes will all be over and endle&s;s Light will dawn. <HI>Weeping may endure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning.</HI> You'll leave the Darkne&s;s of Earth for the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> For truly, <HI>Light is &s;own for the Righteous, and Joy for the upright in Heart. The Night is far &s;pent, the Day is at Hand.</HI> There you'll &s;et in eternal Sun&s;hine, without a Night, and without a Cloud. 'Tis true, you mu&s;t <HI>walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death</HI> to arrive at this: But all on a &s;udden the <HI>Day will break and the Shadows flee away,</HI> the <HI>Shadow of Death</HI> will be <HI>turned into the Light of the Morning.</HI> Angels &s;hall convey your Souls to Paradi&s;e, the fair Regions of Everla&s;ting Day.</P>
<P>And anon your Body &s;hall a&s;cend glitter|ing from the Grave: and <HI>tho' it is &s;own in Di&s;honour, it &s;hall be rai&s;ed in Glory.</HI> You'll &s;ing over your &s;leeping, but quickning Du&s;t, <HI>Ari&s;e and &s;hine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is ri&s;en upon thee.</HI> Then &s;hall you <HI>&s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Fir|nament, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> O how different this magnificent Glory, from the Gloom of the pre&s;ent World!
<PB N="24" REF="004685_0022_100DE570B4FB04D0">Here we need the Moon and Stars to brighten the Shades; and the Sun it&s;elf &s;hines at a <HI>Di&s;tance,</HI> and with <HI>Intermi&s;&s;ions,</HI> and through <HI>Clouds.</HI> And to &s;upply his ab&s;ent Beams we have Recour&s;e to the little Arts of Lamps and Candles. But of that World we read, Rev. xxii. 5. xxi. 23, 24, 25. <HI>There &s;hall be no Night there, and they need no Candle, neither the Moon to &s;hine in it; neither the Light of the Sun: For the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>giveth them Light, and the Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>did lighten it, and the</HI> LAMB <HI>is the Light thereof. And the Nations of them which are &s;aved, &s;hall walk in the Light of it.</HI></P>
