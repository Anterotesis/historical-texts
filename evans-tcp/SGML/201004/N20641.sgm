<Q><BIBL><HI>HOSEA. XIV. 9.</HI></BIBL> Who is wi&s;e, and he &s;hall under&s;tand the&s;e things, prudent and he &s;hall know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the ju&s;t &s;hall walk in them, but the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall fall therein.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SCARCE any thing is more natural to mankind than a de&s;ire of being thought wi&s;e and prudent: we need but little acquaintance with the world to know that hu|man nature cannot be touched in a more tender point, or feel any thing with more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, than reflections on their mental abilities.</P>
<P>But however all may agree in placing high encomiums on wi&s;dom and prudence, they widely differ both in re|gard to the &s;tandard, by which they are to be tried, and the mea&s;ures by which they are to be acquired. They vary in the&s;e re&s;pects, much according to the particular moral &s;tate and temper of the mind, or the variety of objects which, at different times, have the a&s;cendancy of the heart.</P>
<P>Thus while the affections of men are going after their cov|eteou&s;ne&s;s, they vainly imagine wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in laying, and carrying into &s;ucce&s;sful execution, plans well adapted to promote their temporal intere&s;ts and e&s;tates. When they can "join hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and lay field to field," and &s;ay as the rich man in the go&s;pel <HI>intended</HI> to &s;ay, "&s;oul take thine ca&s;e, eat, drink and be merry, for thou ha&s;t much goods laid up in &s;tore, &amp;c." then they have gained their point, and will felicitate them&s;elves upon their wi&s;dom: but in God's account, they are fools. "Thou fool this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee."</P>
<P>When the man of plea&s;ure has &s;ucce&s;sfully devi&s;ed the greate&s;t variety of objects to plea&s;e his brutal &s;en&s;es, and regale his tyrant lu&s;ts&mdash;when the unrighteous man can overreach and defraud his neighbour&mdash;when the vain am|bitious creature thir&s;ting after &s;ame, and living on the
<PB N="4" REF="027102_0003_0FD32642D15F6340">
breath of his fellow worms, can hear the plaudit of thou&s;|ands flattering his pride, and &s;oothing his vanity&mdash;how does his brea&s;t &s;well, with &s;elf applau&s;e, "&s;urely I am the man and wi&s;dom &s;hall die with me."</P>
<P>But, alas! how few e&s;timate their wi&s;dom by what they have obtained of the knowledge of God&mdash;by the advances they have made in a &s;aving acquaintance with the way of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? There are indeed &s;ome who place wi&s;dom in the mere &s;peculative knowl|edge of God, and in their being able to give a clear ac|count of the &s;y&s;tem of doctrines contained in natural and revealed religion&mdash;while in the truth of facts they are ali|enated from the life of God, through the ignorance there is in them, and the blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P>Here then is rhe te&s;t of true wi&s;dom: for none are wi&s;e in God's account, but &s;uch as are wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. For "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom; and a good under&s;tanding have all they who do his commandments." Who is wi&s;e then, and he &s;hall un|der&s;tand the&s;e things; prudent and he &s;hall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the ju&s;t &s;hall walk in them; but the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall fall therein.</P>
<P>The words are a mo&s;t pathetic clo&s;e of the prophecy of Ho&s;ea&mdash;the prophet intimates, in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner, the truth and importance of what he had delivered unto the people in the name of the Lord. He addre&s;&s;es to them an elegant and forcible exhortation to ponder the words of this prophecy to tran&s;cribe into their lives the moral and religious in&s;truction he had given them. As though he had &s;aid, "who is there among you po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of true wi&s;dom? Who is the prudent and di&s;crete man, who knows the importance of religion, and is mak|ing wi&s;e provi&s;ion for the &s;alvation of his immortal &s;oul? He will under&s;tand the doctrines that are contained in this book: he will know the good and right ways of the Lord here pointed out&mdash;he will walk in them. But the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who make a mock at God's word, who de|fy his omnipotent arm, di&s;regarding the warnings, invita|tions
<PB N="5" REF="027102_0004_0FD3264696B82980">
and reproofs contained in this book, &s;hall &s;urely fall into perdition: the very words of life which were de&s;ign|ed to reclaim them, and be the means of their &s;alvation, will eventually increa&s;e their condemnation."</P>
<P>My text is much of the &s;ame import with tho&s;e words of the Prophet Daniel towards the clo&s;e of his prophecy, "Many &s;hall be purified and made white and tried, but the wicked &s;hall do wickedly; and none of the wicked &s;hall under&s;tand; but the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand."</P>
<P>Now, dear Brethren, as we are favored with the means of grace in an higher manner than tho&s;e to whom this prophecy was addre&s;&s;ed&mdash;as we have line upon line, and precept on precept, it is of high importance to enquire what improvement we have made of them, and what is like to be the important i&s;&s;ue. For while they are to &s;ome a &s;avor of life unto life, to others they will be found at la&s;t a &s;avor of death unto death.</P>
<P>This &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, then, as it is not of any private interpretation, may be profitably improved "for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and in&s;truction in righteou&s;|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>We &s;hall accordingly attempt to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. What we were to under&s;tand by the ways of the Lord, which are all right.</P>
<P N="2">II. How it appears to be an high and important branch of wi&s;dom and prudence &s;o to under&s;tand the ways of the Lord as to walk in them.</P>
<P N="3">III. In what &s;en&s;e &s;uch as will not be reformed and made wi&s;e by tho&s;e methods God is u&s;ing with them, will be finally ruined and undone&mdash;"But the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall fall therein."</P>
<P>We are fir&s;t to enquire what we are to under&s;tand by the ways of the Lord, which are all right&mdash;"For the ways of the Lord are right," &s;ays the Prophet, "and the ju&s;t &s;hall walk in them."</P>
<P>Here are two things intimated under the metaphor of ways&mdash;"The ways of the Lord"&mdash;both of which it is proper we &s;hould particularly remark.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027102_0005_0FD32648D784BC98">I &s;hall fir&s;t notice the ways of God's providences: the&s;e, however the rea&s;on of them may be beyond the reach of mortal apprehen&s;ion, yet from the nature of God's moral perfections, and from the word of God, we may be well a&s;&s;ured are all right ways. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" Can infinite wi&s;dom err, infinite ju&s;tice do wrong, or the God of love forget to be gracious? True, indeed, he has his ways in the cloud, and he hides him&s;elf in the thick cloud, &s;o we may often be at a lo&s;s to comprehend the particular de&s;igns of his providence; but we know, that "though clouds and thick darkne&s;s are round about him, yet ju&s;|tice and judgment are the habitation of his throne for|ever"&mdash;"his works are perfect, and all his ways are judgment."</P>
<P>When the Prophet Jeremiah was about to plead with God concerning his providences, being &s;tumbled at the pro&s;perity of the wicked, he fir&s;t expre&s;&s;es his faith in this foundation principle, God is righteous.&mdash;"Righteous art thou, O Lord."</P>
<P>Now, the &s;incere Chri&s;tian will take notice of the&s;e ways of the Lord; he will hearken unto the voice of di|vine providence, and walk with God in all the&s;e di&s;pen|&s;ations: he will acknowledge the wi&s;dom, the equity, the holine&s;s, and goodne&s;s of God in all&mdash;and he will &s;urely endeavour to an&s;wer the wi&s;e and gracious hand of God in all his providences, as far as he is able to com|prehend them. He will be humbled&mdash;allured&mdash;excited&mdash; weaned from the world&mdash;taken off from creature depen|dences&mdash;and brought near to God by all. And thus, whether he has pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity&mdash;both &s;hall work together for his good. And thus he will walk with God in the ways of his providential di&s;pen&s;ations, mo&s;t cordi|ally acknowledging they are all right ways.</P>
<P>Let us in the next place remark, that by the ways of the Lord we are to under&s;tand the way of his moral will&mdash;his word&mdash;his wor&s;hip&mdash;the whole of religion, which he has in any way revealed unto us and enjoined on us&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="027102_0006_0FD3264A5C7CDCA8">This is the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of the word, and that to which the Prophet paid particular attention in the lan|guage of my text&mdash;for he immediately adds, "And the ju&s;t &s;hall walk in them."</P>
<P>Mankind, by their apo&s;tacy, have brought darkne&s;s upon their under&s;tanding, &s;tubborne&s;s into their wills, and rendered all the affections vain and irregular: We are alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in our minds, and the blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of our hearts. It is true, notwith&s;tanding our apo&s;tacy, there are &s;ome remains of the law of God, &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ions of Deity&mdash;of his natural and moral perfections de|lineated on our hearts or con&s;ciences.&mdash;Such had the Gentile world, by which, they being without any written law, were a law unto them&s;elves: Such &s;till remain on the hearts of the ungo&s;peled word at this pre&s;ent; yet the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, made merely by the force of unenlight|ned con&s;cience, have been &s;ound, through a long &s;eries of trial, very ineffectual to reclaim mankind, and bring them to the love and wor&s;hip of the one true God, and the path of virtue and holine&s;s. The infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, therefore, &s;aw fit to reveal his mind and will in a more clear, perfect and effectual manner.&mdash; This revelation we have in the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;tament.&mdash;God, at &s;undry times and diver&s;e man|ners, &s;pake unto the Fathers by the Prophets&mdash;hath &s;po|ken unto us, in the&s;e la&s;t ages of the world, by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the holy Apo&s;tles; &s;o that not only the law of God in the old te&s;tament, &s;tiled "the judg|ments of the Lord"&mdash;the "&s;tatutes of the Lord," &amp;c.&mdash; but the go&s;pel al&s;o of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, may be called the ways of the Lord. For, the go&s;pel is an important part of that revelation by which we are to regulate our lives, and on which we are to found our choice&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Here then we may expect to find the ways of God pointed out unto us with per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion; for by this rule we are all at la&s;t to be judged: for God hath appointed a day when he will judge even the &s;ecrets of mens hearts according to this word.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="027102_0007_0FD3264BD7B2AA68">It is granted, when the Prophet &s;pake the words of our text, Chri&s;t was not come in the fle&s;h; and no doubt he had a principle reference to that part of revelation which God had then made to the world. Yet, if we con&s;ider, that Chri&s;t was even then revealed in types, figures and prophecies&mdash;and that the way of the &s;alvation of &s;inners has been for &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame under every di&s;pen&s;ation, we &s;hall find there is no impropriety in con&s;idering the words "ways of the Lord" in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e, comprehending the whole of divine revelation as we now enjoy it.</P>
<P>Now, my brethren, if we con&s;ider the word of God&mdash; the way of divine truth in which we are to walk, we &s;hall find it infinitely ju&s;t and right, as it is rea&s;onable&mdash;as it is con&s;onant and harmonious in it&s;elf&mdash;as it is a tran&s;cript of the holy nature and will of God&mdash;as it directs us to the great end of our being&mdash;and, as it is plain and ea&s;ily under&s;tood &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for practical u&s;e.</P>
<P>The ways of religion pre&s;cribed in the word of God are right, in as much as they are every way highly ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more profoundly ju&s;t and right than religion rightly under&s;tood; it approves it&s;elf to the rea&s;|on and con&s;ciences of men with an irre&s;i&s;table energy; it is therefore often de&s;cribed under the character of wi&s;dom: "Wi&s;dom hath builded her hou&s;e, &amp;c." the righteous man is the man of wi&s;dom. "Wi&s;dom's ways," namely, the ways of religion, "are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths peace." The Apo&s;tle calls his mini&s;try, a declaration, and a manife&s;tation of the truth unto the con&s;ciences of men. St. Paul &s;peaks in behalf of him|&s;elf and other Apo&s;tles, when he &s;ays, "We have re|nounced the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty, not walking in craftine&s;s, not handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manife&s;tation of the truth, commending our&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Corinthians,</HI> iv. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="027102_0008_0FD3264D608DE490">What can be more rea&s;onable than that he who made all things &s;hould be &s;erved by his creatures?&mdash;That we &s;hould live to him who gave us our being?&mdash;That the Supreme will &s;hould be obeyed?&mdash;That infallible truth &s;hould be believed?&mdash;That he who can de&s;troy, &s;hould be feared?&mdash;That he who does reward, &s;hould be loved and confided in?&mdash;That ab&s;olute ju&s;tice &s;hould vindi|cate it&s;elf again&s;t pre&s;umptuous di&s;obedience?&mdash;And perfect goodne&s;s extend mercy to whom it plea&s;es? What can be more rea&s;onable than that we &s;hould ac|cept the offers of mercy made us in the go&s;pel, when the only terms made nece&s;&s;ary to reaping all its advan|tages are &s;uch as conduce e&s;&s;entially to our happine&s;s?&mdash; That, being purcha&s;ed, not with corruptible things, &amp;c. but with the blood of Chri&s;t, we &s;hould live to his glory who thus hath redeemed us?&mdash;That we &s;hould imi|tate the moral examples of him who hath redeemed us, and walk as he walked, who hath called us unto holine&s;s and virtue? And who, in the completion of our happi|ne&s;s, means we &s;hould be found to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace?</P>
<P>But further, the ways of religion made known to us in the word of God, are all con&s;onant and harmonious: all leading to the &s;ame important end, viz. to God and glory. They are de&s;igned to make us partakers of a divine nature? to &s;hew us how we &s;hall be "ju&s;tified and &s;anctified, and wa&s;hed in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the &s;pirit of our God."</P>
<P>They are perfectly conformable to the holy nature of God; being a tran&s;cript of all the divine perfections. The word of God containing both his law, and the go&s;|pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t makes a wonderful and mo&s;t glorious di&s;play of Deity. If we con&s;ider the method of the &s;inners &s;alvation through faith in the go&s;pel and obedience to the Saviour's commands, and the various means u&s;ed to &s;anctify us and make us meat for glory, we &s;hall behold the perfections of God unit|ing in a bright flame of tran&s;cendant glory. God is ju&s;t,
<PB N="10" REF="027102_0009_0FD326979A8E4760">
yet the &s;inner is ju&s;tified: God is holy: the law honor|ed: the repenting &s;inner forgiven: the ruined creature re&s;tored to more than primitive dignity and happine&s;s: a ve&s;&s;el of wrath fit for de&s;truction, made a ve&s;&s;el of hon|or, and prepared unto glory.</P>
<P>Again, the ways of the Lord in the &s;en&s;e in which we have been con&s;idering them, are right ways, as they are plain and delightful.</P>
<P>Though there are my&s;teries in our holy religion, &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which "men of perver&s;e minds wre&s;t to their de&s;truction." Yet all the impor|tant branches of doctrinal and practical religion are &s;et before us with &s;o much per&s;picuity, that he, who runs may read. There are few, if any, ca&s;es in practice &s;o intricate, but he who &s;tudies the word of God with care, and attends to the language of con&s;cience, may ea&s;ily decide. The &s;ame may be addre&s;&s;ed to mo&s;t of us, which was once the language of our Lord him&s;elf to his Di&s;ciples and followers, "ye know the&s;e things; happy are ye if ye do them." There is no ambiguity in the terms on which eternal &s;alvation is propo&s;ed to our choice. Nor can any thing be plainer than the language in which the invitations of the go&s;pel are made. No|thing more evident, than the requi&s;itions of the go&s;pel upon &s;uch as believe, are ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. Or the nece&s;&s;ity there is, that &s;uch as name the name of Chri&s;t &s;hould depart from iniquity."</P>
<P>The motives by which Chri&s;tians are urged to perform all good works, are exceeding plain and forcible. "It is a faithful &s;aying, and the&s;e things," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, "I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they, who have believed in Chri&s;t, be careful to maintain good works." "We &s;hould live henceforth not unto our&s;elves, but unto him, who died for us and ro&s;e again."</P>
<P>Nothing can be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;tronger language, than the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel on which the Chri&s;tian founds his hope of eternal &s;alvation. "He that believes &s;hall be &s;aved." "The repenting &s;inner &s;hall not die, he
<PB N="11" REF="027102_0010_0FD326993384DBA8">
&s;hall &s;urely live, &s;aith the Lord." "If we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him." "He that conti|nueth unto the end, the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved." "This hope we have, as an anchor to our &s;ouls, &s;ure and &s;tead|fa&s;t, entering into that within the veil, whither the fore|runner is for us entered."</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t important branches of religion are thus made plain and &s;ure in the word of God; &s;o they are likewi&s;e plea&s;ant, &s;uited to the nature of a rational and immortal &s;oul; this ought to recommend unto us the right ways of the Lord.</P>
<P>"Great peace have they who love thy law, nothing &s;hall offend them." "In keeping thy commands there is great reward." "Wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea|&s;antne&s;s and all her paths peace." Religion teacheth us to rejoice in the Lord&mdash;to rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash; "to rejoice alway." No per&s;on mo&s;t &s;urely has &s;o much rational ground for rejoicing as the good chri&s;tian, who&s;e whole conduct is guided by the word of God, and con|formed to the dictates of his con&s;cience. "This is our rejoicing," &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "even the te&s;timony of our own con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;ince|rity, not by fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have our conver&s;ation in the world." "My peace I leave with you," &s;aid the Saviour, "my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you."</P>
<P>IF it be enquired, what are we to under&s;tand by <HI>walking</HI> in the&s;e ways&mdash;"the ways of the Lord are right, and the ju&s;t &s;hall walk in them"&mdash;let it be remarked in a few words, that by this metaphor we are to compre|hend all practical religion. It imports, that we make the word of God, and the candle of the Lord in our brea&s;ts, the rule of all our conduct.&mdash;We receive the &s;criptures, not as the words of men, but, as they are in truth, the words of the living God.&mdash;We believe the doctrines&mdash;the precepts&mdash;the promi&s;es&mdash;and the threat|ning therein contained.&mdash;As, therefore, by the&s;e we have been convinced, that we are guilty creatures, by our
<PB N="12" REF="027102_0011_0FD3269A99BB6AE8">
&s;ins, fallen and under the righteous di&s;plea&s;ure of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, God&mdash;And as the &s;ame word reveals Chri&s;t Je|&s;us unto us, the great propitiatory &s;acrifice for our &s;ins&mdash; the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s unto every one who believes: So we have, in the truth of facts, fled for refuge to him, and laid hold on this hope &s;et before us&mdash;we have renounced all confidence el&s;ewhere, and plead our hope in the grace of the go&s;pel, in him who "of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, redemption"&mdash;and "having thus received the Lord, we now are walking in him." In fine, we now endeavour to walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord blamele&s;s.&mdash;We en|deavour to live in all good con&s;cience towards God and man&mdash;to live as this grace of God which hath appeared unto all men bringing &s;alvation teacheth, denying all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we now live &s;oberly, righte|ou&s;ly and godly, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope and glori|ous appearing of the Son of God. I &s;hall add no more on this plain and important &s;ubject of chri&s;tian duties, which has often been handed out to you from this de&s;k.</P>
<P>We proceed now to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, How it appears to be an high and im|portant branch of wi&s;dom and prudence &s;o to under|&s;tand and know the ways of the Lord as to walk in them. "Who is wi&s;e, and he &s;hall under&s;tand the&s;e things," if he is truly wi&s;e&mdash;if he has the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of true wi&s;dom; he will then under&s;tand the na|ture and importance of that religion which is taught us in the word of God. Or where is the man of prudence who is laying a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that he may lay hold on eternal life? Where is the man of prudence who does not confine his views to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; but, convinced that he &s;hall exi&s;t beyond the grave, is labouring more for the meat which endures to eternal life, than for that which pe|ri&s;hes? Where are the wi&s;e, the prudent men, who fore|&s;eeing the evil coming on an ungodly race of beings, are
<PB N="13" REF="027102_0012_0FD3269C17359AC8">
hiding them&s;elves&mdash;are &s;eeking a &s;ure a&s;ylum in the mercy of God revealed in the go&s;pel covenant. Such happy &s;ouls &s;hall know the&s;e things&mdash;&s;hall know the truth, the importance and excellence of religion in a practical manner. Being taught by the divine &s;pirit, they &s;hall know in the happie&s;t &s;en&s;e&mdash;they &s;hall find, in the ways of God, the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and draw their chief comforts from the word of God&mdash;they &s;hall at the la&s;t, "receive the end of their faith and pa|tience."</P>
<P>Now, what more important branch of wi&s;dom can be named than this? Is the wi&s;dom of this world to be compared with it? Is any thing temporary and peri&s;hing of comparable excellence or importance with tho&s;e things which endure forever? "What is a man profited, tho' he gain the whole world and loo&s;e his own &s;oul; or what would a wi&s;e man give in exchange for his &s;oul?" Shall we make our boa&s;ts of &s;peculative knowledge? Shall we &s;ay, we have a full acquaintance with the doc|trines of chri&s;tianity&mdash;that we are able to give a good account of the whole &s;y&s;tem, and defend every branch of the common faith? Alas! if we have nothing more, all &s;uch knowledge will utterly fail us in the hour of death. Yes, my friends, it will aggravate our condem|nation; and our doom will be like that of the wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, who knew his ma&s;ter's will, and did it not; and therefore was de&s;ervedly beaten with many &s;tripes.</P>
<P>But, the excellence of that practical wi&s;dom which leads us to walk in the ways of the Lord, and make re|ligion the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life, will be farther illu&s;trated if we reflect on the operations of the divine &s;pirit, the great &s;ource of wi&s;dom, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our minds with a powerful transforming &s;en&s;e of the truth and import|ance of religion&mdash;the comforts and advantages even in this life, of practical divine knowledge, or the religion of the heart exhibited in a holy life, above all which is merely &s;peculative&mdash;the importance of it at death&mdash;and
<PB N="14" REF="027102_0013_0FD3269DA4FB9338">
the clo&s;e connection it has with eternal life, by its own nature, transforming the &s;oul into a divine temper; and by the gracious promi&s;e of God Almighty made to us as the di&s;ciples of the great Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the operations of the divine &s;pirit in &s;aving illumination, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mind with a power|ful transforming &s;en&s;e of the truth and importance of re|ligion, we &s;hall &s;ee that practical religion is the highe&s;t wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>No knowledge is &s;o important as &s;uch as re&s;pects our eternal well being, the happine&s;s of our immortal &s;ouls: this is not merely &s;peculative, but practical: it makes a real change in the mind; and produces real effects in a holy life. The apo&s;tle, therefore, connects them in his prayer for the chri&s;tians at Colo&s;s&mdash;"We do not cea&s;e to pray for you, and to de&s;ire, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wi&s;dom and &s;piritu|al under&s;tanding; that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all plea&s;ing; being fruitful in every good thing, and increa&s;ing in the knowledge of God." When God by his &s;pirit enlightens our minds in an effectual and &s;aving manner, he &s;ets before us the beauty, excel|lence and importance of religion in &s;uch a &s;trong point of light as produces a real change in the mind. He convinces us not only that we are fallen under a &s;entence of condemnation by our &s;ins, and &s;o need a pardon; but that we have lo&s;t the moral rectitude of our nature, and &s;o cannot be happy unle&s;s this be re&s;tored to us&mdash;that we have de&s;troyed our&s;elves, and mu&s;t become new creatures&mdash;mu&s;t have new principles and affections&mdash; "mu&s;t be renewed in the &s;pirit of our minds; and put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> new man, which, after God, is created in know|ledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s," or we cannot be happy. Thus the eyes of the under&s;tanding, being en|lightened by the divine &s;pirit in the word of life, we be|hold the beauty and excellence of religion: We approve, and heartily acquie&s;ce in the way of life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the affections of the &s;oul are drawn forth after God.

We delight in him: We delight in his law&mdash;in his word&mdash;in his wor&s;hip, and de&s;ire above all things to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Thus we are "delivered from the power of darkne&s;s, and are tran&s;lated into the kingdom of God's dear Son." We have redemption through his blood, even the for|givene&s;s of &s;in. Thus the prejudices, which po&s;&s;e&s;s the carnal un&s;anctified heart, again&s;t God and pure religion, are removed: We &s;ee things as they are, in their proper nature, and ju&s;t importance unto us; and con&s;equently, we give an infinite preference to religion, above the things which pertain only to time and &s;en&s;e. We &s;ee that wi&s;dom, or true religion, is the principal thing; and are brought, with St. Paul, to count all things but dro&s;s, that we may win Chri&s;t; that we may be found in him, and have the &s;ame mind in us which was al&s;o in him.</P>
<P>Man's original excellence and happine&s;s greatly con|&s;i&s;ted in his conformity to God, in a likene&s;s to the mor|al perfections of Deity&mdash;therefore to recover, in any good mea&s;ure, this moral likene&s;s lo&s;t by our apo&s;tacy&mdash; "to be created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, mu&s;t be man's greate&s;t good, and con&s;equently the means of obtaining it, our highe&s;t wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>But let us reflect a moment on the advantage and comfort derived to us in this life, of practical know|ledge, or real religion's taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and producing its happy fruits in a holy life.</P>
<P>What real, what &s;ub&s;tantial comfort can flow from an un&s;anctified heart? How unfit is the nature of man to receive the &s;pecial con&s;olations of God's &s;pirit, while there are no principles of real &s;incere love to God or any of his ways? "the carnal man," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "re|ceiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned." The carnal mind is enmity to God, and not &s;ubject to the law of God, and therefore it is not in a proper temper to ta&s;te the &s;piritual and divine plea&s;ures of re|ligion.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="027102_0015_0FD33CAAD0F896D8">Con&s;cience, for a while, may be a&s;leep, and irreligious mortals may flatter them&s;elves that all is well with them; or, they may have gained the hope of the hypocrite, which &s;hall peri&s;h when God takes away the &s;oul: or they may rejoice, with the &s;tony ground hearers for a &s;ea&s;on; but all the&s;e are but mere phantoms of the mind; not like the &s;ound, &s;ub&s;tantial joy of the chri&s;|tian, who has the witne&s;s within him&s;elf, from the di|vine temper which the Holy Gho&s;t has wrought in him: This is our rejoicing, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, the te&s;ti|mony of our con&s;cience, &amp;c.&mdash;by the grace of God we have had our conver&s;ation in the world. It is the ex|cellency of the religion of the go&s;pel that it affords to &s;uch as are formed on its gracious plan, a &s;ource of &s;trength, comfort and happine&s;s, which the world can neither give nor take away. It teaches us, in certain circum&s;tances, to glory even in tribulation&mdash;while tri|bulation aids the morality of the heart, or any way tends to promote our chri&s;tian hope, and while we enjoy the light of God's countenance, it fills the mind with joys un&s;peakable. The carnal world may either pity, or de&s;pi&s;e us, according to their capricious humours, be|cau&s;e we do not entertain the &s;ame &s;entiments with them concerning the riches, honors, and plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent &s;tate; but we have bread to eat which they know not of, while, with our divine ma&s;ter, "it is our meat and drink to do the will of our father in heaven."</P>
<P>Let us add to this the importance of the &s;ubject at the hour of death, and we &s;hall &s;urely be convinced that &s;uch as are wi&s;e and prudent will make religion the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life; and e&s;teem every thing el&s;e of &s;mall importance in compari&s;on with their walking in God's ways.</P>
<P>Surely that is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t cour&s;e of living which is mo&s;t likely to afford us comfort and &s;atisfaction in its clo&s;e.

add one moment to our &s;tate of probation&mdash;then the trying &s;cene is opened before us: if we have our rea&s;on in its proper exerci&s;e, the hone&s;t hour of death will give a ju&s;t retro&s;pect of life, and &s;peak real truth to every heart&mdash;then to be able with St. Paul to &s;ay, "I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of glory that fadeth not away:"&mdash;to be able to meet death without a fear; triumphing in him who gives us the victory, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord&mdash;this, this is to be un&s;peakably happy&mdash;to know that "when we are ab&s;ent from the body, we &s;hall be pre&s;ent with the Lord."&mdash;that when "our heart and fle&s;h &s;hall fail us, God will be the &s;trength of our heart and our por|tion forever;" this is &s;urely to di&s;arm death of his ter|rors, and clo&s;e life in a mo&s;t de&s;irable manner.</P>
<P>It is granted, this full a&s;&s;urance of hope is not the happy lot of every chri&s;tian; yet, &s;ince none have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it, unle&s;s they are &s;incere obedient believers, the argument is conclu&s;ive, wholly on the &s;ide of practical chri&s;tianity. A lively faith in Chri&s;t, and a holy life, are the only in&s;tituted means of obtaining com|fort in death: We may further add, that whatever va|riety there may be in the degrees of comforts and &s;atis|faction which chri&s;tians enjoy at the hour of death; yet their future and eternal happine&s;s is equally &s;ecured; and the ways of God &s;hall certainly terminate in ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s: "To them, who by patient continu|ance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, honor and immortal|ity, he will give eternal life." "Write ble&s;&s;ed are the dead who die in the Lord, yea, &s;aith the &s;pirit&mdash;they re&s;t from their labors, and their works follow them."

<P N="1">1. That &s;inners often &s;tumble and fall at the &s;piritu|ality, and &s;ublimity of the doctrines of God's word.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome things in the divine oracle at which the corrupt hearts of men are di&s;gu&s;ted and apt to be offended&mdash;doctrines not adapted to plea&s;e their low and carnal &s;en&s;e&mdash;doctrines &s;o &s;piritual in their nature and tendency, &s;o &s;ublime, &s;o incomprehen&s;ible to the &s;earch|es of a depraved mind, as, by no means, &s;uits the arro|gance of vain mortals, who make their own weak ap|prehen&s;ions the &s;tandard of all truth. When our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aid, "Except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven." Nicodemus, tho'
<PB N="19" REF="027102_0018_0FD33CB0CFA7DBB8">
a ma&s;ter in I&s;rael, cried out, "How can the&s;e things be?" St. Paul, when he preached the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, was derided by the boa&s;ted wi&s;dom of the Athenians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 10.</NOTE> "What doth this babbler mean?" Nor are there wanting many unhappy in&s;tances of &s;elf-boa&s;t|ed wi&s;dom in the pre&s;ent age&mdash;men who cry up human rea&s;on in its pre&s;ent prejudiced and depraved &s;tate as the &s;ole &s;tandard of right and wrong&mdash;they will receive noth|ing upon the authority of God's word, unle&s;s they can fir&s;t comprehend all the rea&s;ons of it: accordingly, when they find doctrines, promi&s;es, threatnings, commands, &amp;c. which they cannot fully comprehend, they pre&s;ent|ly begin to &s;peak in the language beforementioned, "How can the&s;e things be?" "this is impo&s;&s;ible"&mdash;and &s;o reject the whole chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem to their utter confu|&s;ion. Thus the &s;piritual and &s;ublime doctrines of the word "become a &s;tone of &s;tumbling and a rock of of|fence, even unto them that &s;tumble at the word being di&s;obedient." But this leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. Sinners often fall ina&s;much as they cannot approve of the purity and holine&s;s of the divine word, for this directly oppo&s;es their carnal wills and affections. When they hear the great doctrines of &s;anctification, &s;elf-denial, bearing the cro&s;s, great circum&s;pection, and watchful|ne&s;s preached&mdash;when they find they mu&s;t cut off a right hand &s;in, pluck out a right eye &s;in&mdash;the&s;e are "hard &s;ayings, who can hear them?" the&s;e are contrary to the lu&s;ts and corruptions of a depraved nature, and &s;o they are offended at the word. Thus the amiable youth in the go&s;pel came to Chri&s;t as the great teacher &s;ent from Heaven&mdash;he came running&mdash;he came and kneeled be|fore him, and &s;aid "good Ma&s;ter what good thing &s;hall I do to inherit eternal life?"&mdash;But when he found he mu&s;t, at Chri&s;t's command, part with all, and give to the poor, that in&s;tead of great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he mu&s;t bear a cro&s;s, he was grieved&mdash;was offended, going away very &s;orrowful. This brings me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="027102_0019_0FD33CB485403918">3. That the convincing power of the word, as it di&s;|covers to &s;inners their great &s;infulne&s;s and danger, is, &s;ometimes, the means of preventing their attendance on public in&s;titutions, and prejudicing them again&s;t the word. Thus it comes to pa&s;s, that while the word is a &s;avor of life unto life to &s;uch as diligently attend upon it, and are obedient to the truth, it is a &s;avor of death unto death to &s;uch as reject it&mdash;And tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors fall therein, as their condemnation will be greatly increa&s;ed by their neglect of tho&s;e means of grace which they had in their power; but refu&s;ed to improve. Accordingly, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has long &s;ince taught us their guilty mi&s;erable ca&s;e in &s;uch language as this&mdash;"this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, but men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil."</P>
<P>If the Prophets will "prophecy &s;mooth things;"&mdash; if they will "few pillows under every arm hole"&mdash;if they will cry "peace when God &s;ays there is no peace."&mdash;If mini&s;ters will flatter their people with vain hopes, and not touch upon any alarming and awakening &s;ubject, or prevailing iniquity, &s;inners will hear them: But if they &s;eek to plea&s;e God rather than man&mdash;if they lay open the danger of man's &s;inful e&s;tate, and come home to the con&s;cience, pre&s;ently &s;ecure &s;inners are offended, and the great enemy of &s;ouls gains his point. Precious &s;ouls are in danger of enduring the pains of the &s;econd death, when they take offence at the &s;earching nature of the word. I mu&s;t yet add,</P>
<P N="4">4. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors often fall by the word as they take occa&s;ion from the free mercy and grace of God manife&s;|ted therein, to encourage them&s;elves in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>When they hear that God is merciful&mdash;that he is the God of love&mdash;that he pardons &s;inners&mdash;that he is ready to forgive; they are in danger of arguing in this perver&s;e manner; "Surely he will not &s;uffer me to be mi&s;erable forever&mdash;there is no &s;uch extreme danger of peri&s;hing as mini&s;ters pretend."&mdash;They are ready to &s;latter them|&s;elves,
<PB N="21" REF="027102_0020_0FD33CB810729A10">
that they &s;hall have peace, though "they walk in the way of their wicked hearts, and add drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t." Thus they turn the grace of God into wan|tonne&s;s: But "there is no peace to the wicked &s;aith my God"&mdash;and though hand join in hand, the wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed. Which reminds me of the la&s;t thing I have here to ob&s;erve, viz.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, or the finally impenitent, will &s;tum|ble and fall by the word as they &s;hall be judged by it.</P>
<P>"The word which I have &s;poken, &s;ays Chri&s;t, the &s;ame &s;hall judge you at the la&s;t day." This is the great rule by which he, to whom all judgment is committed by the Father, will judge the world which he came to redeem. The much de&s;pi&s;ed word of God&mdash;the peace|ful go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will then break forth as a fire to devour the adver&s;aries. Heaven and earth &s;hall then pa&s;s away, but his word &s;hall not pa&s;s away. And oh! how will the worm which dieth not in the human brea&s;t, and the fire which there cannot be quenched, rend the heart with extreme agonies&mdash;while the unhappy &s;inner will be obliged to own that the &s;ame word which warn|ed him of his approaching ruin, and invited him to ac|cept of mercy, will be the rule of his trial, and the means of increa&s;ing his future puni&s;hment. O that we all might con&s;ider the&s;e terrors of the Lord, and be per&s;ua|ded.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e with a few reflections.</P>
<P N="1">1. How much does it concern us to meditate on the ways of God; to approve them and walk therein.</P>
<P>We have all turned out of the right ways of the Lord by our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and have been walking in the ways of the de&s;troyer of &s;ouls. If under the power of reign|ing &s;in&mdash;if yet impenitent and di&s;obedient to the heav|enly voice which addre&s;&s;es to us the words of life, we are walking in the broad road that leads to de&s;truction: this way may &s;eem right to us for the pre&s;ent, but the end thereof is death. There is a narrow way, the way of true religion, which, though it may be attended with
<PB N="22" REF="027102_0021_0FD33CB913CAC9A8">
many difficulties, yet will &s;urely end in eternal life. This, if duly con&s;idered, will approve it&s;elf to our rea|&s;on&mdash;will be found to be right, and ju&s;t, &s;afe and plea|&s;ant. All that are truly wi&s;e and prudent will walk therein&mdash;be approved of God, and made happy forever: for "the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly &s;hall peri&s;h." The highe&s;t branch of wi&s;dom is that which has the happie&s;t influ|ence on our eternal &s;tate. While multitudes, therefore, are laying out all their labors, and be&s;towing the mo&s;t careful thoughts on things which are peri&s;hing, and are indeed e&s;teemed wi&s;e by the men of the world; let us, my dear friends, act a wi&s;er part&mdash;chu&s;e the path of life, and &s;ecure that better part which &s;hall never be ta|ken from us; and in order hereto, let us &s;tudy with the greate&s;t diligence and care the word of God, and attend upon all the in&s;titutions of Heaven: "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us pray for the influences of the divine &s;pirit to enlighten our minds&mdash;to in&s;pire us with true wi&s;dom and prudence&mdash;and deeply impre&s;s our hearts with a &s;en&s;e of the nature and importance of religion in &s;uch a manner, that we may be brought under its practical in|fluence.</P>
<P>"The &s;pirit of God taketh of the things of God, and &s;heweth them unto us." The go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through the enlightning influence of the holy &s;pirit, will become the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God to our &s;alvation. The way in which we may expect his &s;acred influence is, in the diligent u&s;e of all in&s;tituted means&mdash;reading and hearing the word&mdash;fervent per&s;e|vering prayer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Are any of us &s;o happy as to have made choice of the right ways of the Lord? Have we been enlightened by the word and &s;pirit of God? Do we experimentally know the beauty, excellence and importance of the things contained in the word of God? Let us, with the mo&s;t profound reverence and highe&s;t gratitude, adore
<PB N="23" REF="027102_0022_0FD33CBA9E0DEC88">
that merciful Being who has favored us with the means of moral and religious in&s;truction, and the gracious in|fluences of the divine &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Let us endeavour to walk in the ways of God &s;o cir|cum&s;pectly, and with &s;uch diligent care, that we may &s;top the mouths of Dei&s;ts and Infidels, and recommend the ways of religion to an in&s;pecting world. Let us en|deavour to grow more and more in the divine life; to grow and make &s;peedy advances in our practical ac|quaintance with the things of religion: let us daily &s;tu|dy to improve in the knowledge of the divine word, and the heavenly temper which breathes in it: then, though a vain and prophane world &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e us as fools&mdash; enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or madmen, becau&s;e we carefully walk in the&s;e ways of the Lord; we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the time is not far di&s;tant, when nothing will appear of any comparable importance with true religion, that wi&s;dom which is from above, teaching us how to be in a good mea&s;ure happy here, and compleatly happy in the next world!</P>
