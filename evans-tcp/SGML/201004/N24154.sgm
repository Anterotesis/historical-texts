<P>THE following me&s;&s;age from the Pre&s;ident of the United States was communicated to the two Hou&s;es.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, I mentioned that &s;ome circum&s;tances of an unwelcome na|ture had lately occurred in relation to France; that our trade had &s;uffered, and was &s;uffering, exten&s;ive injuries in the We&s;t Indies from the cruizers and agents of the French Republic; and that communications had been received from its mini&s;ter here which indicated danger of a further di&s;turbance of our commerce by its authority, and that
<PB N="4" REF="031946_0003_0FEF5C66F371E430">
were, in other re&s;pects, far from agreeable: but that I re&s;erved for a &s;pecial me&s;&s;age, a more particular commu|nication on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. This communication I now make.</P>
<P>The complaints of the French mini&s;ter embraced mo&s;t of the tran&s;actions of our government in relation to France, from an early period of the pre&s;ent war; which, therefore, it was nece&s;&s;ary carefully to review. A col|lection has been formed of letters and papers relating to tho&s;e tran&s;actions, which I now lay before you, with a letter to Mr. Pinckney, our mini&s;ter at Paris, containing an examination of the notes of the French mini&s;ter, and &s;uch information as I thought might be u&s;eful to Mr. Pinckney, in any further repre&s;entations he might find ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be made to the French government. The im|mediate object of his mi&s;&s;ion was to make to that govern|ment &s;uch explanations of the principles and conduct of our own, as, by manife&s;ting our good faith, might remove all jealou&s;y and di&s;content, and maintain that harmony and good under&s;tanding with the French Republic, which it has been my con&s;tant &s;olicitude to pre&s;erve. A govern|ment which required only a knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> to ju&s;|tify its mea&s;ures, could not but be anxious to have this ful|ly and frankly di&s;played.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To give the <HI>letter,</HI> accompanying this me&s;&s;age, is impo&s;&s;ible; nor would its in&s;ertion here, per|haps, an&s;wer any u&s;eful purpo&s;e; as it has alrea|dy been publi&s;hed both in the public papers and in a pamphlet. It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that it &s;hould be read and well remember|ed by every one, who is intere&s;ted in the honour and happine&s;s of this country. <HI>Adet's</HI> charges again&s;t the Federal government, which were com|batted in the November Cen&s;or, have here met
<PB N="5" REF="031946_0004_0FEF5C781BCE7820">
with a more ample refutation; rea&s;oning that ne|ver can be overturned, becau&s;e founded on facts that never can be denied. The motives of the in&s;idious friend&s;hip of the French, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, are completely unveiled: in place of a debt of gratitude, it is now clear that America owes them nothing but re&s;entment and contempt: re|&s;entment for their treachery and contempt for their threats.</P>
<P>As a compo&s;ition, this letter reflects great ho|nour on the writer. Mr. Pickering as been con|temptuou&s;ly called a &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>in form</HI> to the late Secretary of State; but, the judicious arrange|ment, the per&s;picuous &s;tyle and the manly &s;en|timents of this voluminous &s;tate paper, &s;hows that he is not a &s;ucce&s;&s;or either in form or in &s;ub&s;tance to the bungling and prevaricating Randolph.</P>
<P>Upon the rea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition, that very few, if any of my readers, ever &s;ee the Gallician Ga|zette of Benjamin Franklin Bache, it may not be ami&s;s to take notice of the cen&s;ure with which this clum&s;y tool of an unprincipled faction has ho|noured the publication of Mr. Pickering's letter.</P>
<Q><P>The Executive pretended that they wi&s;h to pre&s;erve a good under&s;tanding with the French Republic, and yet they are pur&s;uing every mode which can have a <HI>tendency to embroil us with that country.</HI> The letter of <HI>man Timothy</HI> to Mr. PINCKNEY is a &s;trong evidence of this intention. This letter endeavours in&s;idiou&s;ly to criminate the Republic for the conduct of the monarchy, and con|tains as <HI>much irritation as could be conveyed from the admi|ni&s;tration.</HI> What is mo&s;t remarkable is, that the letter is de&s;igned as a guide to our mini&s;ter, and yet is pub|li&s;hed here <HI>before</HI> it can have po&s;&s;ibly reached France,
<PB N="6" REF="031946_0005_0FEF5C7B6B74AA10">
and indeed when it mu&s;t be believed that the publica|tion and the letter it&s;elf will reach that country at the &s;ame time. Is the matter or manner of this letter in the &s;tyle of conciliation?</P>
<P>Does it not, on the contrary, breathe a di&s;po&s;ition to excite new recriminations on the part of the Directory? Does it not &s;eem de&s;igned to clo&s;e the door of amicable accommodation? Would the publication have been made, unle&s;s there exi&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition in our govern|ment to put France at defiance? If accommodation was the object, would the <HI>reflections have been made public again&s;t the French nation?</HI> That a letter de&s;igned as a kind of in&s;truction to our mini&s;ter &s;hould have been made public <HI>before</HI> it reached him, is one among the ab|&s;urdities which have characteri&s;ed the admini&s;tration.&mdash; If a re&s;toration of harmony was in the &s;erious contem|plation of the Executive, he would have tran&s;mitted the letter and have kept the Directory ignorant of its irri|tating contents until every pro&s;pect of accommodation was at an end, and <HI>then it would have been time enough to make it known in ju&s;tification of the admini&s;tration;</HI> but to do it at this time &s;trongly implies a di&s;po&s;ition to excite &s;uch re&s;entments as &s;hall put reconciliation en|tirely out of the que&s;tion. It has ever been the opini|on of tho&s;e who ob&s;erved the conduct of the Executive, that they were the enemies of the French Republic, their declarations to the contrary notwith&s;tanding, and if any additional evidence was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the belief, the letter to Mr. PINCKNEY will not leave a doubt on the mind of any unprejudiced American.</P></Q>
<P>Does not this &s;ound well from the man, who ju&s;tified Citizen Adet's contemptuous appeal from the government to the people? Who publi&s;hed that appeal, and who, le&s;t its &s;editious tendency &s;hould be defeated by delay, publi&s;hed an ab&s;tract of it, with a commentary &s;till more inflammatory than the appeal it&s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031946_0006_0FEF5CA31A714598">The French have a right to do whatever they plea&s;e: in&s;ult, beat, tread upon: brave the go|vernment, accu&s;e it of every crime that malice can invent; but the government of the United States mu&s;t not think of retaliating, nor even of ju&s;tifying it&s;elf to tho&s;e, before whom it has been &s;o fal&s;ely and in&s;olently accu&s;ed! The <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> Adet tells the people of America, and the whole world, that the Federal Government has i&s;&s;ued a declaration of <HI>in&s;idious</HI> neutrality; that it acts by <HI>chicane;</HI> that from the courts of ju&s;tice <HI>no ju&s;tice is to be expected;</HI> that the treaty with France has been <HI>violated;</HI> that, in &s;hort, the conduct of the govern|ment has been marked by every trait of cowar|dice and perfidy. The Pre&s;ident would have been fully ju&s;tified in a perfect retaliation; that is, in cau&s;ing the refutation of the&s;e calumnious charges to be publi&s;hed <HI>in France,</HI> and that too in a language equally daring with that of Citizen Adet; but he has thought this beneath the re&s;pect due to him&s;elf and to the nation with who&s;e con|fidence he has &s;o long been, and yet is, honoured. He has, therefore, been content with ju&s;tifying his conduct in the eyes of his con&s;tituents. Yet this is too much for the full grown grandchild of Doc|tor Franklin: it is "irritating," and calculated to "clo&s;e the door of amicable negociation." It is irritating for a man to deny the fal&s;ehoods that have been vomited forth again&s;t him, and to prove, to tho&s;e who has inve&s;ted him with power, that he has not betrayed his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Novel as this doctrine appears, neither Mr. Bache nor any of his friends can claim the honour of the invention. It is borrowed from the code of the Revolutionary Tribunal of France, that
<PB N="8" REF="031946_0007_0FEF5C7D1405E290">
hopper of the famous national mill, vulgarly call|ed the guillotine. In this bloody court, <HI>no evi|dence</HI> is heard <HI>in favour of the accu&s;ed.</HI> As much again&s;t him as you plea&s;e, &s;o that there be no lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>This was the form of proce&s;s intended for the Pre&s;ident and his officers of &s;tate. Citizen Adet di&s;charges his duty as <HI>accu&s;ateur public,</HI> con&s;igns them over to the "national ju&s;tice," and his ad|vocate Citizen Bache now complains, that they have had the impudence to reply.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave guillotine lawyer Bache to con|tinue his pleadings and to receive his merited re|ward, bundles of a&s;&s;ignats and millions of hone&s;t cur&s;es, and &s;hall ju&s;t take notice of one or two articles of accu&s;ation which were not contained in the Diplomatic Blunderbu&s;s, but which have come to light through Mr. Pickering's letter.&mdash; <Q>Indeed, &s;ays he, the French Mini&s;ter has di&s;covered an aptitude to complain. I may cite, as in&s;tances, his letters of the 9th of Ja|nuary and 3d of March 1796: the former, be|cau&s;e the colours of France, which he had pre|&s;ented to the United States, were not <HI>perma|nently fixed and di&s;played before Congre&s;s:</HI> the latter, becau&s;e &s;ome printers of almanacs or other periodical publications in the United States, in arranging the names of the foreign mini&s;ters and agents re&s;ident among&s;t us, <HI>had placed tho&s;e of Great-Britain before tho&s;e of France and Spain!</HI> Mr. Adet de&s;ired my <HI>declaration in writing</HI> that the government of the United States had no concern in printing the works in which the agents of the French republic were
<PB N="9" REF="031946_0008_0FEF5C7E9C0877C8">
regi&s;tered after tho&s;e of Great-Britain, and that <HI>the works them&s;elves might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> I gave him an an&s;wer in writing with my con&s;ent to his publi&s;hing it in the new&s;papers, agreeably to his reque&s;t. The an&s;wer &s;tates that in mat|ters of this kind the government did not and could not interfere. With regard to the co|lours, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in what concerns our foreign relations, the Pre&s;ident being the &s;ole repre&s;entative of the people of the United States, they were properly pre&s;ented to him. He received them with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, and directed them to be depo&s;ited with our national archives, that both might be pre&s;erved with equal care.</Q></P>
<P>The flag &s;hould, by right, have been permanent|ly di&s;played before the eyes of Congre&s;s, to re|mind them of their duty towards the "terrible nation;" but then, the Citizen did not perceive that a great difficulty would have occurred from our having two chambers. To have cut a&s;under the emblem of fraternal love would have been a portentous &s;ign; and, though the members of the Senate, who would have wi&s;hed to rally under a &s;ans-culotte rag, were few in number, yet there is no rea&s;on to believe that they would have pati|ently left their friends of the other Hou&s;e in the &s;ole enjoyment of the honourable ombrage. They would have wrangled like the Godde&s;&s;es for the apple, or, rather, like dogs for a bone. The Pre|&s;ident, undoubtedly, fore&s;aw this, and therefore he wi&s;ely determined to take it from them altogether, and to lock it up &s;afely with the Archives of the United States, where neither moth nor ru&s;t, nor any thing el&s;e, doth <HI>corrupt.</HI> How different would
<PB N="10" REF="031946_0009_0FEF5CAF5636B4E0">
its &s;ituation have been, had it remained continual|ly di&s;played in the Hall!</P>
<P>If my memory does not deceive me, the Ame|rican flag was carried to the Convention by Citi|zen Barney. This man has ever &s;hown an un|common zeal for the honour of the flag of his country; for, I remember, that he wrote a very pathetic letter from Jamaica, addre&s;&s;ed to a mem|ber of Congre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing the grief of his at once noble and tender heart, at &s;eeing the American flag hung up <HI>reversed</HI> under that of Great-Britain, while he him&s;elf was in irons, and con&s;equently unable "to avenge his dear country's wrongs." Since tho&s;e unhappy days Citizen Barney is be|come a French commodore of two frigates, and will probably ri&s;e to the rank of Admiral, if con|trary winds &s;hould not drive him in the way of the cruizers of the enemy. He was &s;ometime &s;kulking about the We&s;t-India &s;eas, and <HI>to be re|venged of the Briti&s;h</HI> for in&s;ulting the American flag, what does the brave commodore do, but &s;eize an American merchantman, &s;wing her flag up <HI>re|versed</HI> under that of France, and clap the captain in irons. There's <HI>retaliation</HI> for you. There's avenging his "dear country's wrongs."!&mdash;A few &s;uch in&s;tances of patrioti&s;m will, I hope, convince the Briti&s;h, and every other in&s;olent overbearing nation, that, however vengeance may &s;leep for a time, the American flag will never be in&s;ulted with impunity, while there are Barneys in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>To return and take farewel of the French co|lours; it is well enough to ob&s;erve, that, on the day or day after, the French Mini&s;ter made his complaint to the Secretary of State, re&s;pecting
<PB N="11" REF="031946_0010_0FEF5C94B7DA5AE8">
the fate of the colours, the very &s;ame complaint was made in Bache's Gazette. Not that I would in&s;inuate that Mr. Bache is in the pay of the Con|vention, and that his paper has no other &s;upport: the minds of the public have long been made up as to that point. But it is &s;omething worth ob|&s;erving, as it &s;trongly tends to prove, that exactly the &s;ame thought may &s;trike, at the &s;ame moment, two per&s;ons who have <HI>not</HI> the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> connection with each other.</P>
<P>The complaint again&s;t the <HI>Almanac-Makers</HI> has more of the ridiculous in it than any thing to be found on the records of up&s;tart api&s;hne&s;s. Be|cau&s;e the de&s;pots of Paris had &s;tyled them&s;elves the legi&s;lators of the Univer&s;e, it entered into the &s;apient &s;kull of Citizen Adet, that they were &s;o in reality, and that, of cour&s;e, it was a &s;pecies of trea&s;on to rank their agent beneath tho&s;e of other powers.</P>
<P>This complaint &s;hows how narrowly they watch us. They dog us like our murderers. They are every where, and in every &s;hape. They in&s;inuate them&s;elves into all companies, among every de|&s;cription of the people. They tent all our actions, words and looks. To rate the number of their &s;pies, &s;pread over the United States, at five thou|&s;and, is keeping far within compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The demanding of a <HI>po&s;itive declaration,</HI> that the government had <HI>no hand in the publications</HI> in que&s;tion, proves clearly that the Citizen looked upon that government as in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute de|pendence on his own; and his reque&s;ting that the
<PB N="12" REF="031946_0011_0FEF5C6881A36730">
Almanacs, &amp;c. "might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed," gives us a tolerable idea of that liberty of the pre&s;s, which we &s;hall enjoy, when we fall under the juri&s;diction of the French.&mdash;"That the works them&s;elves might be <HI>suppre&s;sed</HI>"! It would appear that the &s;un-beams of liberty, that have lately broken in upon the French, have had no very great effect on Citizen Adet. I have always &s;aid, that they know nothing of freedom but the name, and here we have a proof of it. The Citizen thought that our government was like his own; that the laws were a mere mockery, and that we were as com|pletely in bondage as the &s;laves of Paris, who are led to the guillotine for printing the Lord's Pray|er or the Decalogue. Poor mini&s;ter of the "ter|rible nation"! How mu&s;t he have &s;marted at my an&s;wer to his Blunderbu&s;s, and how will he &s;mart if he &s;hould remain here till I print an Almanac! I will put his name beneath tho&s;e of the Envoys of the Savages of America; for I am &s;ure every one will allow, that the nations they repre&s;ent are far more reputable and humane than his. I will range him after Citizens Complanter, Bull-Dog, and Dog's-Head. Should we receive a mini&s;ter from the Hottentots, who wear unemptied guts round their carca&s;&s;es, as the more bruti&s;h <HI>fonctio|naires publics</HI> in France do their tricolored &s;carfs; &s;hould we receive a mini&s;ter from this polite peo|ple, that of regenerated France &s;hall come after him in my Almanac.</P>
<P>If the Citizen was ignorant enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that the government could &s;uppre&s;s one publica|tion, he certainly mu&s;t believe that its power ex|tended to others al&s;o; and then, how comes it to pa&s;s, that he had not demanded the <HI>suppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of
<PB N="13" REF="031946_0012_0FEF5C6BD0542148">
&s;ome other works, that I could mention (if I dar|ed), which &s;eem to be better calculated for giving offence than a poor inoffen&s;ive Almanac. But, in the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Citizen found nothing to wound that little &s;omething, which, it &s;eems, tic|kles the hearts of republicans as well as tho&s;e of royali&s;ts. It is diverting enough to &s;ee the vanity of a democratic citizen breaking out into com|plaints about precedence; about the po&s;t of ho|nour in a two-penny Almanac, and an Almanac too of the <HI>"Old Style."</HI> The reptiles that have &s;prung up out of the ruins of the French nobility, are ten thou&s;and times more bloated with vanity than that nobility, or any other, ever was. They know they are de&s;pi&s;ed, and they wi&s;h to obtain by force what the will refu&s;es them. They have fully verified the old maxim: "Set a beggar on hor&s;e-back, and he'll ride to the devil."</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other facts that Mr. Pickering's letter has brought to light, which will command attention another time; for the pre&s;ent I mu&s;t leave them, to record an event that reflects as much honour on the people of America as it pro|mi&s;es them pro&s;perity: I mean the election of Mr. John Adams to the office of Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States.</P>

<P>The Speaker informed the Hou&s;e that the hour was come at which they had appointed to meet the Senate, for the purpo&s;e of counting the votes for, and declaring the election of a Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States; and that the Clerk would inform the Senate, they were ready to receive them.</P>

<P>Thus ended the triumph of the cau&s;e of order over that of anarchy and confu&s;ion; and thus Citizen Adet's Blunderbu&s;s was proved to be an in&s;trument of &s;ound and not of execution.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031946_0015_0FEF5C81253B99D8">The friends of America, all over the world, will congratulate her on this event; will applaud the wi&s;dom of her choice. Mr. Adams's learning, his wi&s;dom, and his integrity, are univer&s;ally known, and as univer&s;ally acknowledged, except by the partizans of democratic tyranny. To this he has long been a declared and formidable foe, and that he will ever continue &s;o, the &s;teady per|&s;everance exhibited in his pa&s;t life is a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>At any time whatever, to &s;ee &s;uch a man at the head of the Federal Government, mu&s;t have been a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction to every well-di&s;po&s;ed mind; but at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is it is particularly &s;o. Well a&s;&s;ured that he is neither to be deceived nor in|timidated, the at once in&s;idious and in&s;olent ene|mies of our pro&s;perity and independence will put on the appearance, at lea&s;t, of moderation: and though ju&s;tice for the pa&s;t is not in their power, they will be deterred from any further commi&s;&s;ion of inju&s;tice. How much they dread his admini&s;tra|tion is be&s;t determined by their efforts to keep him from the Pre&s;idential Chair. They fore&s;aw that his election would be the death-&s;troke to their intrigues at Philadelphia, and eventually to the propaga|tion of their abominable principles in this exten|&s;ive country. That infidels may for once prove prophets, is my &s;incere and hearty wi&s;h, as I believe it is of nine-tenths of the community.</P>
<P>Regarding, as I do, the elevation of Mr. Adams as a national ble&s;&s;ing, I &s;hould think my&s;elf want|ing in ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, to whom (under heaven) we owe it, were I to omit giving their meritorious exertions as much publicity as it lies in my power

<P>It is a notorious fact, that in this election, the partizans of France, or rather of the French ty|rants, were ranged in oppo&s;ition to the friends of the Federal Government. I do not in&s;inuate that Mr. Jeffer&s;on would now wi&s;h to &s;ee this government &s;ubverted; but, it is well known, it has been often a&s;&s;erted and as often proved, that he has ever been oppo&s;ed to the principles on which it is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="18" REF="031946_0017_0FEF5C5D8D081AF8">
and on which it mu&s;t &s;tand, if it &s;tands at all. His partiality for the de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem of the up|&s;tart rulers of France is al&s;o well known. His <HI>philosophy</HI> and politics perfectly harmonize with theirs. His partizans, &s;o far from denying his be|ing <HI>a dei&s;t,</HI> defend it: and his public recommen|dation of the infamous Tom Paine's Rights of Man, as a means of oppo&s;ing <Q>the political here&s;ies which have &s;prung up among&s;t us,</Q> &s;ufficiently explains his political creed.</P>
<P>That the French regicides looked to him as a proper in&s;trument for facilitating their encroach|ments on the independence of America, no one can doubt, that has read Fauchet's intercepted let|ter and the menacing notes of Citizen Adet, and that has been a witne&s;s of the electioneering in|trigues of their hirelings.</P>
<P>Proof has been too often given to need repeti|tion here, that the great object of the French has ever been, and &s;till is, to cut off all communica|tion between this country and Great Britain, as the only effectual means of rendering us totally de|pendent on them&s;elves. Con&s;cious of their own inability, in a fair competition, to &s;upplant Great Britain as the manufacturer for America; and con&s;cious al&s;o that the in&s;eparable and growing intere&s;ts of the two countries mu&s;t produce a per|fect reconciliation, and may finally lead to an alliance that would for ever fru&s;trate their projects, they have mi&s;&s;ed no opportunity of exerting their influence to de&s;troy an intercour&s;e, dangerous to their ambition and to that alone. The endea|vours of their partizans have uniformly tended to this point. They have, indeed, varied their
<PB N="19" REF="031946_0018_0FEF5CC2CA1803D0">
means, but the end has always been the &s;ame.&mdash; Fir&s;t, it was propo&s;ed (and the propo&s;ition was brought forward at a favourable juncture) to di&s;|courage the trade with Britain by impo&s;ing heavier duties on goods imported thence than on tho&s;e imported from France. The pretext, the mi&s;erable pretext, for this, was, <HI>to force Great Bri|tain into a commercial treaty with America!</HI> Du|plicity unmatched, and almo&s;t incredible! The men, who brought forward this propo&s;ition, have by the current of &s;ub&s;equent events, been led to declare, that America &s;tands in need of com|mercial treaties with <HI>no nation on earth, and par|ticularly with Britain!</HI> It was hoped that the Se|nate would adopt the regulations, propo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed in the other Hou&s;e, and it was naturally ex|pected, that an attempt to <HI>force</HI> a treaty down the throat of the Briti&s;h would produce ju&s;t a contra|ry effect. The Senate &s;aw through the veil of di&s;|gui&s;ed ho&s;tility, and the Executive took the nece&s;|&s;ary mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h, <HI>without force,</HI> what the in&s;idious propo&s;als profe&s;&s;ed to have in view, but what they were in reality intended to prevent.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not quit this &s;ubject without hear|ing Citizen Fauchet, of treacherous memory, who is a mo&s;t excellent expo&s;itor of dark points. <Q>The &s;e&s;&s;ions of 1793 and 1794, &s;ays he, had given importance to the <HI>republican party</HI> [vulgarly call|ed the <HI>French faction</HI>], and &s;olidity to its <HI>accu&s;a|tions.</HI> The propo&s;itions of Mr. Madi&s;on, or his pro|ject of a navigation act, <HI>of which Mr. Jefferson was originally the author,</HI> &s;apped the Briti&s;h in|tere&s;t, now an integral part of the financiering &s;y&s;tem.</Q>&mdash;Thus we &s;ee, then, that the famous <HI>re|solutions</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="031946_0019_0FEF5C6E39DC6890">
that were to &s;ap the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, or trade, the revenue ari&s;ing from which was become an integral part of the financiering &s;y&s;tem, were a&s;cribed to a wrong per&s;on; and that patriot Ma|di&s;on, who has been honoured with &s;uch loads of democratic applau&s;e on this account, was no more than the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument of the then Secretary of State; he was no more, in the opinion of Fauchet at lea&s;t, than the fore-hor&s;e of the French team, that the Virginian Philo&s;opher, with his long whip, was driving through the mire of oppo&s;ition. Full well I remember the time. The little man bridled up and a&s;&s;umed a va&s;t deal of &s;elf-impor|tance; but we are now told that the trappings were not his own, and are left to &s;uppo&s;e, that his va|nity was nothing more than that of a quadruped leader, who&s;e head the partial clown has hung with bells or decorated with garlands.&mdash;I do not like this compari&s;on. The hor&s;e is a noble, ma|je&s;tic animal; and we all know how offen&s;ive &s;uch ideas are to republican minds, though figur|atively u&s;ed. They do not go in teams, otherwi&s;e I might have been led to one of tho&s;e &s;agacious and ever honoured, though comparatively dimi|nutive creatures, on which the Redeemer of the World made his public entry into Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on quitted the field before the &s;tormy times of <HI>&s;eque&s;tration</HI> and <HI>total prohibition</HI> came on; but, if we may believe Fauchet (who certain|ly was in all the &s;ecrets of the antifederal party), we &s;hall find that retirement was not the only thing he &s;ighed for. "Con&s;ult Munroe" (&s;ays Fauchet, in his letter to the Convention), <Q>Con|&s;ult Munroe; he had <HI>apprized me</HI> of the men whom the current of events had dragged along
<PB N="21" REF="031946_0020_0FEF5CB85C2E89E0">
as bodies devoid of weight. His friend Madi|&s;on is al&s;o an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man</Q> [in the French &s;en&s;e of the word, of cour&s;e]. <Q>Jeffer&s;on, on whom the <HI>patriots</HI> ca&s;t their eyes to &s;ucceed the Pre&s;ident, has fore&s;een the&s;e cri&s;es. He <HI>prudently</HI> retired.</Q> &mdash;For what?&mdash;To enjoy the tranquil plea&s;ures of a country life? To become one of <Q>God's cho&s;en people, <HI>if he ever had</HI> a cho&s;en people,</Q> as he him&s;elf calls the cultivators of the land?&mdash; It was not for this. He did not retire merely to wander through the groves, to li&s;ten to the oaten reed of the &s;mutty &s;wains, nor to &s;olace his limbs in the &s;ilver brooks of his modern Arcadia; no, nor to inhale the fragrance of its tobacco-fields neither. <Q><HI>He</HI> prudently <HI>retired, to avoid making a figure,</HI> again&s;t his inclination, <HI>in &s;cenes,</HI> the &s;e|cret of which will &s;oon or late be brought to light.</Q> &mdash;Thank ye, Fauchet. Had it not been for the clue, which you have here given us, &s;ome artful people might yet continue to a&s;&s;ert, and &s;ome &s;illy people to believe, that <Q>Mr. Jeffer&s;on retired from the <HI>foppery</HI> of the <HI>monarchical</HI> court of Philadelphia, with no other motive than that of adding to the &s;tock of philo&s;ophy, to the litera|ry honour of America, and the good of man|kind.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on did, then, fore&s;ee "the&s;e cri&s;es," the&s;e trouble&s;ome times; he fore&s;aw the violent conduct of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives: he fore|&s;aw that the oppo&s;ition to the exci&s;e law would end where it did, in open rebellion; and fore&s;ee|ing all this, <Q>he <HI>prudently</HI> retired, to avoid mak|ing a figure <HI>again&s;t his inclination,</HI></Q> on the &s;ide of government (which, as Secretary of State, he mu&s;t have done), le&s;t thereby he &s;hould lo&s;e the
<PB N="22" REF="031946_0021_0FEF5C86E4C97B00">
future &s;upport of the <HI>"patriots,"</HI> who had <Q>ca&s;t their eyes on him to &s;ucceed the Pre&s;ident.</Q> The partizans of Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;ay, that &s;uch was the opinion of <HI>Fauchet only!</HI> This is preci&s;ely what I want them to allow. The opinion of the French mini&s;ter a&s;&s;uredly became the opinion of his ma&s;|ters; and, it is their opinion re&s;pecting Mr. Jef|fer&s;on's principles that I am endeavouring to make appear. Whether they were deceived by appear|ances, or not, is of little con&s;equence now. It is from what <HI>they thought</HI> of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, whether right or wrong, that we are to form an e&s;timate of their motives in attempting to impo&s;e him, as Pre|&s;ident, on the people of the United States.</P>
<P>Now that the electioneering manoeuvres have failed, the hirelings of France pretend, that Adet's Notes were by no means intended to have the ef|fect which has been looked upon as their princi|pal object; and that it is the height, the very &s;um|mit of ab&s;urdity, to &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch thing, to &s;up|po&s;e what is now reduced to a certainty as indi&s;|putable as any that ever was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Notes in &s;ub&s;tance declare, that the French are offended at the conduct of the Pre&s;i|dent and his council, that they have re&s;olved on &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els, and on breaking off all diplo|matic communication with us, till the govern|ment returns to it&s;elf; not forgetting to hint at the &s;ame time, and that in terms comprehen&s;ible to the meane&s;t capacity, that a change of <HI>men</HI> as well as mea&s;ures, is the only means of reconcilia|tion.</P>
<P>As to <HI>nominating</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of General Wa&s;hington and his officers of &s;tate, that could
<PB N="23" REF="031946_0022_0FEF5C98A9BE95A0">
have an&s;wered no u&s;eful end; that part of the bu|&s;ine&s;s was prudently left to their faithful &s;tipen|diaries, who immediately exclaimed, as if from &s;udden in&s;piration, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on was the only man capable of making our peace with the ju&s;tly enraged, "terrible republic." However, le&s;t we &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the vociferations of this vile herd, Citizen Adet takes care to drag Mr. Jeffer&s;on in|to his fir&s;t Note, and that in &s;uch a way as leaves not the lea&s;t doubt as to his object in &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Still, however, there would be &s;ome little lati|tude for di&s;pute, were the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of com|municating the&s;e Notes left out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>All the pretended grounds of complaint, among which I include the ratification of the Briti&s;h treaty, exi&s;ted in the month of July, 1795. How came it to pa&s;s, then, that the Convention of France, whom I hope no body will accu&s;e of an over degree of lenity and forbearance; how came it to pa&s;s, that the&s;e vengeful de&s;pots, who &s;cent the blood of di&s;obedient nations from afar, and are ever ready to ru&s;h upon their prey; how came it that they &s;hould re&s;erve their threats till the 2d of July 1796? Again; &s;uppo&s;ing for a moment, that their wrath had lain dormant all this while, how did it happen that the determination to menace us with cha&s;ti&s;ement, which was taken on the 2d of July, was kept a profound &s;ecret till the 27th of October, four entire months all but five days, in a &s;ea&s;on of the year when even two months is a long pa&s;&s;age from France to the United States? Mr. Pickering expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e, and well he might, that the violent re&s;olutions of the Convention &s;hould be notified at &s;o late an hour, and without any new &s;ubject of complaint. Had a redre&s;s of the
<PB N="24" REF="031946_0023_0FEF5CB0DC1E93F0">
injuries complained of been the object of the Notes, and of the mea&s;ures they communicate, why were they delayed for a year and four months, and then poured out upon us all of a &s;ud|den, on the 27th of October, 1796, &s;even days previous to the election?</P>
<P>The manner, too, of the communication clearly proves its intent. If reparation of wrongs had been the real end propo&s;ed, why was the commu|nication not left with the government, which alone could make that reparation? Why did Citizen Adet treat with the people? And why did he do this before it was po&s;&s;ible for him to know what an&s;wer he &s;hould receive from the government? His appeal from the government to the people was an outrage of decency, a violation of the law of nations, and a direct attack on the &s;overeignty of the United States; it was an act that the Con|vention it&s;elf had recalled Genet for <HI>talking of</HI> only; and why &s;hould they now authorize its <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> unle&s;s to an&s;wer &s;ome end of extraordina|ry importance? It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the Pre&s;ident would not publi&s;h the&s;e Notes, till ac|companied with a refutation of the charges they contain, and then they would not only have ap|peared di&s;armed, but al&s;o too late for effecting their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To the conclu&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, it has been objected, 1&s;t, that the Convention could not be informed of Gen. Wa&s;hington's intention to re&s;ign, at the time when they gave their mini&s;ter his in&s;tructions, and there|fore could not po&s;&s;ibly do it with a view of fright|ening the people into a choice of Mr. Jeffer&s;on: and 2dly, that Adet could have no &s;uch intention,
<PB N="25" REF="031946_0024_0FEF5CC544338BD8">
or he would have publi&s;hed his notes at an earlier day, to give them time to reach every quarter of the Union, before the election came on.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e objections, I allow that it is po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;pies of the Con|vention had not been able to apprize them of the Pre&s;ident's de&s;ign; I allow that that arch fiend, formerly bi&s;hop of Autun, who had wound his pro|tean form into all the circles of Philadelphia; I will allow that even the devil, their con&s;tant cro|ny, had not apprized them of it; but what is that to the purpo&s;e? Citizen Fauchet, though apprized of a good deal, was not apprized of it; yet he was apprized, that <Q>the <HI>patriots</HI> had fixed their eyes on <HI>Mr. Jeffer&s;on</HI> to &s;ucceed the Pre&s;ident;</Q> and of this he informed the Convention. It was not, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be ap|prized of General Wa&s;hington's intention to re|&s;ign. Mr. Jeffer&s;on was to be oppo&s;ed to whom&s;o|ever &s;hould appear as a candidate for the office, whether Wa&s;hington, or Adams, or any body el&s;e; and as the French knew when the election mu&s;t take place as well as we did, time was all they had to attend to. So that this mighty objection is at once &s;o completely done away, that even fools may walk over it blindfolded.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd objection, that Adet could not publi&s;h his menaces with an intention of influenc|ing the people in their choice, becau&s;e the publica|tion did not take place time enough to reach every quarter of the Union, previous to the day of elec|tion, every man, however carele&s;s an ob&s;erver he may be of the politics of the different &s;tates mu&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="031946_0025_0FEF5C5F13BBA6A8">
&s;ee that the publication took place &s;oon enough and not a moment too late.</P>
<P>There were two notes, the fir&s;t was intended to influence the people in their choice of electors, and the la&s;t to influence the electors in their choice of the Pre&s;ident. One was publi&s;hed &s;e|ven days only before the people met, and the other about as many days before the a&s;&s;embling of the electors. That this was not time enough for them to reach every &s;tate is evident, and it is as evident, that, to accompli&s;h their object, it was not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould. The &s;entiments of the people <HI>to the north of the Delaware,</HI> and of tho&s;e <HI>to the south of the Po|tomack,</HI> were as well known before the election as they are at this day. Penn&s;ylvania and Maryland alone were ju&s;tly looked upon as balancing be|tween the two candidates; and &s;even days was a &s;pace of time ju&s;t &s;ufficient to give circulation to the threats, without leaving time for the people and their electors to recover from the panic, that it was hoped they would produce, before the elec|tion was over. The Jacobins, as Burke ob&s;erves, are very accurate calculators. They never mi&s;s the nick of time. They know to a moment when to look big, and when to fawn: when to give you the fraternal hug, and when to knock you down.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult has proved, that all that was to be feared or hoped for, by either party, lay in the&s;e two States, and therefore the Frenchman's blun|derbu&s;s was di&s;charged ju&s;t in time to have all the influence that it was probable, or po&s;&s;ible, it &s;hould have. I feel a &s;atisfaction, however, in a&s;|&s;erting, that it had none at all. The votes for Mr. Adams in Maryland prove that French principles have lo&s;t, in place of gaining ground, in that State;
<PB N="27" REF="031946_0026_0FEF5CC70EA16C20">
and, as to poor Penn&s;ylvania, though appearances are again&s;t her, though <HI>fourteen</HI> French votes to <HI>one</HI> American one brand her with ignominy, yet I hope, with the indulgence of the reader, to prove, that this unfortunate State, this faire&s;t &s;i&s;ter of the family, appears much more culpable than &s;he real|ly is, and that her tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion has proceeded from her amiable weakne&s;s rather than from any radical vices.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the electors are not cho&s;en for &s;e|parate di&s;tricts. Each di&s;trict does not begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> clo&s;e the election of its electors; but, fifteen per|&s;ons become candidates for the elector&s;hip of the whole &s;tate. The &s;ame men are put up and voted for in all the di&s;tricts; the whole number of votes for each man are at la&s;t collected by the governor (who&s;e conduct in the pre&s;ent election I would ap|plaud, were I not afraid the hone&s;t reader would kick me for it), who then i&s;&s;ues his proclamation declaring who are the per&s;ons cho&s;en. From this regulation it follows, that a majority of a &s;ingle vote, upon the whole number of freemen, may give the &s;tate the appearance of unanimity on a point on which it is nearly equally divided. This was not far from being the ca&s;e in the election we are now &s;peaking of.

<P>That dei&s;m is philo&s;ophy no one will deny, and therefore I cannot di&s;pute the claim here prefer|red to the title; but what good did Rittenhou&s;e do to mankind? Dr. Ru&s;h, indeed, &s;ays, that he did a great deal, and particularly to his own coun|try; but, with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the hyperbol|ical bomba&s;t of Dr. Ru&s;h, and his <HI>eulogium</HI> on the <HI>politics</HI> of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, I never heard of any good to mankind, and particularly America, that he did, except determining the boundaries of &s;ome of the States, <Q>which he did with <HI>great preci|&s;ion?</HI></Q> and which I could have done as well as he, had I received the &s;ame pay for it. One &s;ingu|lar &s;ervice, indeed, he rendered his country, and that <HI>gratis</HI> too: he volunteered as <HI>president</HI> of that &s;editious club, the Democratic Society of Phi|ladelphia, and he him&s;elf &s;igned the inflammato|ry re&s;olves again&s;t the exci&s;e law, which encour|aged the malcontents to ri&s;e in open rebellion, for the quelling of which, reader, you and I have paid, and &s;till pay, a portion of our earnings.&mdash; The devil take &s;uch "<HI>good</HI> to mankind," I &s;ay! &mdash;Doctor Ru&s;h is a very fine man, to be &s;ure, and he writes in a fine Doctor-like manner; but the remor&s;ele&s;s Doctor Ru&s;h &s;hall <HI>bleed me</HI> till I am as white as this paper, before I'll allow that this was "doing good to mankind."</P>
<P>Mr. Rittenhou&s;e's real friends have too much di&s;cretion to compliment his under&s;tanding at the expen&s;e of his heart. They confe&s;s that his &s;im|plicity and want of political knowledge expo&s;ed
<PB N="35" REF="031946_0034_0FEF5CB9E2751B20">
him to the duplicity of tho&s;e &s;ubtle fiends in hu|man &s;hape, who were at the bottom of the demo|cratic in&s;titution, and who only wanted the weight of his name. But his eulogi&s;t will in&s;i&s;t that he was &s;o profound, &s;o far&s;ighted a politician, that he even &s;cented the delicious days of republican|i&s;m <HI>twenty years</HI> before they arrived! Nay, &s;uch is the zeal of Dr. Ru&s;h, that he vows and declares his friend was <HI>born a republican;</HI> though every one knows, that he was born under the royal go|vernment of Britain. But, don't let us mi&s;con|&s;true the Doctor. He means a <HI>mental</HI> republi|can. <HI>Born</HI> a <HI>mental</HI> republican! Upon my &s;oul it is a wonder he had not traced his republicani&s;m a little further back, and turned the eulogium on his decea&s;ed &s;ubject into a lecture of anatomy.</P>
<P>Either Mr. Rittenhou&s;e was the dupe of the Democratic Society, or he was not. If he was, the eulogium on his politics was as unju&s;t as it was ab&s;urd; if he was not, the eulogium on his good|ne&s;s of heart was more &s;o. In &s;hort all that is &s;aid, in this performance, of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e's philo|&s;ophy, &s;hould have been better &s;aid, and all that is &s;aid of his politics &s;hould have been omitted. The former is a dry unintere&s;ting narrative, and the latter &s;o glaring a departure from truth, that it will attract but little more re&s;pect for his memory, than the hog's-wa&s;h <HI>toa&s;ts</HI> of the factious Society of which he was Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>We now come to <HI>Doctor Franklin's</HI> <Q>good to mankind.</Q>&mdash;As a politician, his wi&s;hing to give up the fi&s;heries and We&s;tern Po&s;ts, for fear of of|fending France, is a convincing proof of his merit,
<PB N="36" REF="031946_0035_0FEF5C6099CFC9C0">
and mu&s;t render a toa&s;t to his memory particular|ly plea&s;ing to Citizen Adet. As a <HI>morali&s;t</HI> the Doctor's <HI>"example"</HI> is certainly a u&s;eful one; more e&s;pecially in a country like this that is thinly in|habited. "Increa&s;e and multiply," is an injunc|tion that this great man had continually in his mind; and &s;uch was his zeal in the fulfilment of it, that he paid very little attention to time or place or per&s;on.</P>

<P>I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>toa&s;ters,</HI> but not without remarking, what is well worth remarking, that, as <HI>Doctor Prie&s;tley</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Philadelphia com|memoration of the French alliance, &s;o <HI>Napper Tandy</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;ame commemoration at New-York, where the <HI>toa&s;ts</HI> breathed just as much foul air again&s;t the Federal Government as tho&s;e of Philadelphia did. This would prove, if proof of the fact were yet wanted, that men of faction will &s;till be factious in whatever country and un|der whatever government they may live. Here is no e&s;tabli&s;hed hierarchy for Doctor Prie&s;tley to rail at, nor are there any <HI>tithes</HI> for him to wrangle for; and yet he cannot be quiet. Wherever the &s;tandard of di&s;content is hoi&s;ted, there the Doctor is a volunteer, ready armed and accoutred, whether it be in a conventicle or a club-room, whether the attack be to be made with &s;craps of &s;cripture, mangled and profaned from the quiver|ing lips of malice, or with blackguard toa&s;ts roared forth from the lungs of gluttony and drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>After this in&s;tance of ho&s;tility (as far as ex|hau&s;ted powers can lead him) again&s;t the General Government of America, I hope we &s;hall hear no more of his peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, of his com|ing among&s;t us <Q>to enjoy that toleration which
<PB N="41" REF="031946_0040_0FEF5CA5857AB5C0">
his native land denied him," and of his wi&s;h to continue <HI>unmole&s;ted</HI> tho&s;e pur&s;uits of various literature to which, without having ever enter|ed into any <HI>political connections,</HI> his life has been devoted.</Q> If he never before entered into <HI>po|litical connections,</HI> he has done it now, at any rate. If his pre&s;ent <HI>intimacy,</HI> I &s;ay <HI>intimacy,</HI> with Citi|zen Adet; his toa&s;ting &s;uccess to the fleets of France, Spain, and Batavia, and the in&s;ulting &s;ar|ca&s;ms on the Federal Government, contained in the above li&s;t; if his herding along with all tho&s;e who hate, who oppo&s;e and who &s;lander this go|vernment, and who&s;e only object is to overturn it, and render the country dependent on France; if this be not entering into <HI>political connections,</HI> I do not know what is.</P>
<P>I hope al&s;o, that tho&s;e who were &s;imple enough to believe the Doctor, when he profe&s;&s;ed his at|tachment to the royal government of his country, and &s;olemnly declared that neither he nor his friends thought of, or wi&s;hed for, a revolution, will be convinced of his duplicity, when they hear him toa&s;ting "The <HI>Republic</HI> of Great Britain," and wi&s;hing that the pre&s;ent year may witne&s;s the <HI>jubilee;</HI> the revolutionary jubilee, the jubilee of plunder and carnage, of incendiaries, thieves, philo&s;ophers and cannibals.</P>
<P>The conduct of this per&s;evering demagogue, and that of all tho&s;e who, like him, have fled from Britain to America, is the be&s;t ju&s;tification that the &s;trong mea&s;ures of Billy Pitt can have. While on the other &s;ide of the water, they only wanted a <HI>reform,</HI> a gentle reform; a very little would have done; a correction of abu&s;es or &s;o. They only
<PB N="42" REF="031946_0041_0FEF5CBC59E46B00">
wanted to <Q>re&s;tore to the con&s;titution its <HI>primi|tive purity,</HI> its ancient integrity and <HI>excellence.</HI> The tools of power had in&s;inuated that they wanted to <HI>pull down,</HI> when their only intention was to <HI>repair,</HI> the <HI>goodly fabric.</HI></Q> This was their plaintive cant while in England; but, once arrived in America, once removed from the dan|gers of Botany Bay, the jail and the halter, they have no &s;cruple to confe&s;s, nay they boa&s;t, that if <HI>tyranny</HI> had not di&s;appointed their projects, they would, e're this, have repaired <Q><HI>the</HI> goodly fa|bric,</Q> into a republic, and buried king George under the rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>Let this, then, be a warning to you, Engli&s;hmen (if ever the&s;e remarks &s;hould fall into your hands): beware of the pit that the&s;e &s;ubtle fiends are preparing for you; be blind to their pauper exhibitions, and deaf to their crocodile cries. If you follow them but one &s;tep, you are gone, you are engulphed for ever. Under your govern|ment, whatever faults it may have (for none ever was without), your property and per&s;ons are in &s;afety; under the change that they would ope|rate, neither would be of long exi&s;tence: fir&s;t they would take your money and goods, and then, for fear of your revenge for the robbery, your lives. This is the &s;ure and certain progre&s;s in which they advance, and to this tend all their words and all their actions. We know them bet|ter than you do. The &s;ight of the gibbet kept them in awe, impo&s;ed a re&s;traint on their tongues; we have &s;een their bo&s;oms bare, and have had the di&s;cretion to profit from the di&s;covery.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="031946_0042_0FEF5CBDE179EE58">When in Britain, they, like their apo&s;tle of &s;e|dition, Paine, held up our government to your imitation, and dunned your ears with the rare talents and virtues of our Chief; but now, be|hold! they &s;lander both. Our government is but a copy of yours, and General Wa&s;hington is be|come an apo&s;tate, a hypocrite, a George Guelph. This <HI>"land of liberty,"</HI> (and which is truly &s;uch, if ever there was a land of liberty in the world) This "land of liberty," to which they fled, as they pretended, from the <Q>rude arm of lawle&s;s power,</Q> is now become a den for &s;laves, <Q>where the proud tyrant, ari&s;tocracy of wealth, lords it over the hone&s;t but indigent citizen.</Q>&mdash; The &s;ame tone, the &s;ame language, the very &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions, are now applied to this government, with which you were formerly amu&s;ed, and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, of which you had nearly been the dupes. If this does not rouze you from your credu|lity, if this does not open your eyes, you de&s;erve to be plunged into all the horrors of revolution, into de&s;olation without bounds and mi&s;eries without end.</P>
<P>Recollect that this le&s;&s;on comes to you from the United States of America, from Philadelphia, the &s;pot to which your deceivers re&s;orted in hopes of meeting men of their own minds. It is with plea&s;ure and with pride that I a&s;&s;ure you, they were di&s;appointed. A tyrant crowd does not govern here, as they were taught, and as they taught you, to believe. To &s;ay that they have fallen into ne|glect would be too much, for they never were no|ticed. Poverty, though rarely vi&s;ible here, is ge|nerally their lot. A thread-bare coat, a dirty &s;hirt
<PB N="44" REF="031946_0043_0FEF5C8FC8DDBAC8">
and a long beard are, with us, the di&s;tinctive marks of a <HI>Republican Briton.</HI> And the&s;e are the wretches, oh! credulous Engli&s;hmen! that were leading you about in crowds at their heels. The&s;e were your oracles, the expo&s;itors of your laws and the defenders of your rights. The&s;e &s;crofulous philo&s;ophers, the&s;e political lepers, whom we &s;ick|en but to &s;ee, you were hugging to your bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>"Wi&s;dom is in age;" but, it &s;eems, this maxim does not hold good with re&s;pect to nations. In the calendar of &s;tates, America was born but ye&s;|terday; yet &s;he has had the di&s;cernment to &s;ee through, and to fru&s;trate, the de&s;igns of tho&s;e men, who have de&s;troyed the faire&s;t part of Europe, and have &s;hook the re&s;t to its very ba&s;e. There they had to encounter adamantine in&s;titutions grown &s;tronger with time: here there &s;eemed no|thing to oppo&s;e them, the whole continent lay open to their demon-like a&s;&s;aults; yet have they been completely defeated by the peaceful opera|tion of the national <HI>good &s;en&s;e.</HI> In vain did they attempt to cajole us; in vain did they a&s;&s;ume the language, and put on the garb, of liberty; it was &s;oon perceived that their liberty and ours was not the &s;ame thing. <HI>Republicani&s;m,</HI> was the next bait; but we al&s;o perceived that it was French and not American republicani&s;m; we &s;aw that as our &s;tock could not be augmented, no good could come from a partner&s;hip with them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, in the general apprehen&s;ion of an inten|tion to retire, in that mo&s;t eminent citizen, to whom all eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted, as the centre of our union for &s;o long a period; the public opinion had exhibited any clear indications of another, in whom our fellow citizens could have generally united; as &s;oon as I read that excellent addre&s;s which announced the nece&s;&s;ity of deliberation in the choice of a Pre&s;ident, I &s;hould have imitated the example of a character, with which I had co-operated, though in le&s;s con&s;picuous and important &s;tations, and maintained an uninterrupted friend&s;hip for two and twenty years. But as a number of cha|racters appeared to &s;tand in the general e&s;tima|tion, &s;o nearly on a level, as to render it difficult to conjecture, on which the majority would fall; con&s;idering the relation in which I &s;tood to the people of America, I thought it mo&s;t re&s;pectful
<PB N="46" REF="031946_0045_0FEF5C656CF965B0">
to them, and mo&s;t conducive to the tranquillity of the public mind, to re&s;ign my&s;elf with others, a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the general deliberation, and a pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun|trymen in general, for their long continued kind|ne&s;s to me, and for that &s;teady and affecting con|fidence, with which tho&s;e who have mo&s;t inti|mately known me, from early life, have on &s;o many great occa&s;ions entru&s;ted to me, the care of their deare&s;t intere&s;ts; &s;ince a majority of their electors, though a very &s;mall one, have de|clared in my favour, and &s;ince, in a republican government, the majority, though ever &s;o &s;mall, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity decide, I have determined at every hazard of a high but ju&s;t re&s;pon&s;ibility, though with much anxiety and diffidence, once more to engage in their &s;ervice.&mdash;Their confi|dence, which has been the chief con&s;olation of my life, is too precious and &s;acred a depo&s;it ever to be con&s;idered lightly. As it has been found|ed only on the qualities of the heart, it never has been, it never can be, deceived, betrayed, or forfeited by me.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance, and with all the&s;e emo|tions of gratitude and affection, which a long ex|perience of your goodne&s;s ought to in&s;pire, that I now retire from my &s;eat in this hou&s;e, and take my leave of the members of the Senate.</P>
<P>I ought not to declare, for the la&s;t time, your adjournment, before I have pre&s;ented to every &s;enator pre&s;ent, and to every citizen who has ever been a &s;enator of the United States, my
<PB N="47" REF="031946_0046_0FEF5C92375F56B8">
thanks, for the candour and favour invariably re|ceived from them all. It is a recollection, of which nothing can ever deprive me, and it will be a &s;ource of comfort to me, through the re|mainder of my life, that, as on the one hand, in a government con&s;tituted like ours, I have for eight years held the &s;econd &s;ituation under the con&s;titution of the United States, in perfect and uninterrupted harmony with the fir&s;t, without envy in one, or jealou&s;y in the other: &s;o, on the other hand, I have never had the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;under&s;tanding with any member of the &s;enate. In all the ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions, difficult conjunctures, dangerous emergencies, and animated debates upon the great intere&s;ts of our country, which have &s;o often and &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed all our minds, and intere&s;ted the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of the heart, I have experienced an uniform polite|ne&s;s and re&s;pect from every quarter of the hou&s;e. When que&s;tions of no le&s;s importance than diffi|culty, have produced a difference of &s;entiment (and differences of opinion will always be found in free a&s;&s;emblies of men, and probably the greate&s;t diver&s;ities upon the greate&s;t que&s;tions), when the &s;enators have been equally divided, and my opinion has been demanded according to the con&s;titution, I have con&s;tantly found, in that moiety of the &s;enators, from who&s;e judgment I have been obliged to di&s;&s;ent, a di&s;po&s;ition to al|low me the &s;ame freedom of deliberation and independence of judgment which they a&s;&s;erted for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e walls, for a cour&s;e of years, I have been an admiring witne&s;s of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of information, eloquence, patrioti&s;m and indepen|dence,
<PB N="48" REF="031946_0047_0FEF5C9D88EC4570">
which, as they would have done honour to any &s;enate in any age, afford a con&s;olatory hope (if the legi&s;latures of the &s;tates are equally careful in their future &s;elections, which there is no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t) that no council more per|manent than this as a branch of the legi&s;lature will be nece&s;&s;ary, to defend the rights, liberties, and properties of the people, and to protect the con&s;titution of the United States, as well as the con&s;titutions and rights of the individual &s;tates, again&s;t errors of judgment, irregularities of the pa&s;&s;ions, or other encroachments of human in|firmity, or more reprehen&s;ible enterprize, in the executive on one hand, or the more immediate repre&s;entatives of the people on the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations will all con&s;pire to ani|mate me in my future cour&s;e, with a confident reliance, that as far as my conduct &s;hall be uni|formly mea&s;ured by the con&s;titution of the Unit|ed States, and faithfully directed to the public good, I &s;hall be &s;upported by the &s;enate, as well as by the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and the people at large; and on no other conditions ought any &s;upport at all to be expected or de&s;ired.</P>
<P>With cordial wi&s;hes for your honour, health, and happine&s;s, and fervent prayers for a conti|nuation of the virtues, liberties, pro&s;perity and peace of our beloved country, I avail my&s;elf of your leave of ab&s;ence for the remainder of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>IN SENATE, <HI>Wedne&s;day, February</HI> 22.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the Vice Pre&s;ident of the United States on his retiring from the Se|nate, was ye&s;terday agreed to as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Senate of the United States would be unju&s;t to their own feelings, and deficient in the performance of a duty their relation to the go|vernment of their country impo&s;es, &s;hould they fail to expre&s;s their regard for your per&s;on, and their re&s;pect for your character, in an&s;wer to the addre&s;s you pre&s;ented to them, on your leaving a &s;tation which you have &s;o long and &s;o honour|ably filled as their Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The motives you have been plea&s;ed to di&s;clo&s;e which induced you not to withdraw from the public &s;ervice, at a time when your experience, talents, and virtues, were peculiarly de&s;irable, are as honourable for your&s;elf, as from our con|fidence in you, Sir, we tru&s;t the re&s;ult will be beneficial to our beloved country.</P>
<P>When you retired from your dignified &s;eat in this hou&s;e, and took your leave of the members of the Senate, we felt all tho&s;e emotions of gra|titude and affection, which our knowledge and experience of your abilities, and undeviating im|partiality ought to in&s;pire; and we &s;hould with painful reluctance endure the &s;eparation, but for the con&s;oling reflection, that the &s;ame qualities
<PB N="50" REF="031946_0049_0FEF5CABE47FB830">
which have rendered you u&s;eful, as the Pre&s;ident of this branch of the legi&s;lature, will enable you to be &s;till more &s;o, in the exalted &s;tation to which you have been called.</P>
<P>From you, Sir, in whom your country have, for a long period, placed a &s;teady confidence, which has never been betrayed or forfeited, and to whom they have on &s;o many occa&s;ions en|tru&s;ted the care of their deare&s;t intere&s;ts, which have never been abu&s;ed.&mdash;From you, who hold|ing the &s;econd &s;ituation under the Con&s;titution of the United States, have lived in uninterrupted harmony with him who has held the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>From you we receive with much &s;atisfaction, the declaration which you are plea&s;ed to make of the opinion you entertain of the character of the pre&s;ent &s;enators, and of that of tho&s;e citizens who have been heretofore &s;enators. This declaration, were other motives wanting, would afford them an incentive to a virtuous per&s;everance, in that line of conduct which has been honoured with your approbation.</P>
<P>In your future cour&s;e, we entertain no doubt, that your official conduct, will be mea&s;ured by the con&s;titution, and directed to the public good, you have therefore a right to entertain a confi|dent reliance, that you will be &s;upported, as well by the people at large as by their con&s;tituted au|thorities.</P>
<P>We cordially reciprocate the wi&s;hes which you expre&s;s for our honour, health, and happine&s;s: we join with yours, our fervent prayers for the
