<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders the number and extent of the Bri|ti&s;h colonies, on this continent&mdash;their climates, &s;oil, ports, rivers, riches, and numberle&s;s advantages&mdash;mu&s;t be con|vinced of their va&s;t importance to Great Britain; and be at a lo&s;s to account for the ignorance concerning them, which prevails in tho&s;e kingdoms, whence their inhabitants origi|nally &s;prang. The merchants, indeed, by profitable experi|ence, have not been altogether unacquainted with our trade and our growth; and &s;ome gentlemen of an inqui&s;itive turn, by the help of their corre&s;pondents, have obtained the knowledge of many other particulars equally important. But the main body of the people conceive of the&s;e plantations, under the idea of wild, boundle&s;s, inho&s;pitable, uncultivated de&s;erts; and hence the puni&s;hment of a tran&s;portation hi|ther, in the judgment of mo&s;t, is thought not much le&s;s &s;evere, than an infamous death. Nay, appealing to facts, we may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that even the public boards, to who&s;e care the&s;e exten&s;ive dominions have been more e&s;pecially committed, attained, but lately, any tolerable acquaintance with their condition. This is the more to be wondered at, as it is natural to imagine, that the king's governors have &s;ta|tedly tran&s;mitted full accounts of their re&s;pective pro|vinces. The ca&s;e had been quite otherwi&s;e. Governments were heretofore too often be&s;towed upon men of mean parts, and indigent circum&s;tances. The former were incapable of the ta&s;k, and the latter too deeply engro&s;&s;ed by the &s;ordid views of private intere&s;t, either to pur&s;ue or &s;tudy our common
<PB N="8" REF="024800_0005_0FCD62609CDA2390">weal. The wor&s;t con&s;equences have re&s;ulted from the&s;e mea&s;ures. Perpetual animo&s;ities being engendered between the governors, and the people &s;ubjected to their authority; all attempts for conciliating the friend&s;hip of the Indians, promoting the fur trade, &s;ecuring the command of the lakes, protecting the frontiers, and extending our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons far into the inland country, have too often given place to party projects and contracted &s;chemes, equally u&s;ele&s;s and &s;hameful. The conduct of the French has been ju&s;t the rever&s;e: in &s;pite of all the di&s;advantages of a cold climate, a long and dangerous navigation up the river of St. Law|rence, a rough, barren, un&s;ettled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Encore moins peupl&eacute;."

The continent, for many hundred leagues, has been thoroughly explored&mdash;the main pa&s;&s;es fortified&mdash;innumerable tribes of Indians either won over to their intere&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Notre nation, la &s;eule, qui ait eu le &s;ecret de gagner l'affection des Ameriquains." Charlevoix.</NOTE> &s;ubdued, or bri|dled&mdash;the fur trade engro&s;&s;ed&mdash;a communication maintain|ed between the extremes of New France&mdash;the Briti&s;h colo|nies e&s;tricted to &s;cant limits along the &s;ea &s;hore, and noth|ing left remaining for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a va&s;t empire, but to open a free water pa&s;&s;age to the ocean, by the con|que&s;t of the province of New York.</P>
<P>If the governors of the&s;e plantations had formerly been animated by the &s;ame generous and exten&s;ive views, which in&s;pired mr. Burnet; the long-projected de&s;igns of our common enemy might, with the aid of Great Britain, have been many years ago &s;upplanted, or at lea&s;t defeated, at a trifling expen&s;e. But alas! little, too little attention has been had to the&s;e important affairs, till the late encroach|ments on the river Ohio, in the province of Penn&s;ylvania, gave the alarm, and the mini&s;try were appri&s;ed of the French machinations, by the &s;ea&s;onable repre&s;entations of general Shirley; and if the colonies have now attracted the notice of his maje&s;ty and his parliament, their grateful acknowledgments are due principally to the noble lord, to whom the&s;e &s;heets are dedicated, for his laudable enqui|ries into their &s;tate, and his indefatigable zeal and indu&s;try for their defence and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent our affairs begin to wear a more &s;miling a&s;|pect. We are under the guardian&s;hip of a &s;overeign, who
<PB N="9" REF="024800_0006_0FCD6263B16566A8">delights in the welfare of his people; are re&s;pected by a parliament, affected with a generous &s;ympathy for the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of their fellow &s;ubjects, in all their di&s;per&s;ions; and by a wi&s;e improvement of the Briti&s;h aids, it is hoped, we &s;hall be able, to retrieve the ill con&s;equences of our long, reproachful, and in&s;en&s;ible &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Formerly the colonies were at home di&s;regarded and de|&s;pi&s;ed, nor can any other rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned for it, than that they were unknown. This is, in a great degree, to be im|puted to our&s;elves. If our governors withheld tho&s;e infor|mations, which their duty required them to have given, per&s;ons of private characters ought to have undertaken that u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k. But, except &s;ome accounts of the &s;ettlements in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay, and Virginia, all the other hi&s;tories of our plantations upon the continent, are little el&s;e than collections of fal&s;ehoods, and wor&s;e than none. That this charge again&s;t tho&s;e publi&s;hed concerning this province, in particular, can be fully &s;upported, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, will inconte&s;tably appear from the following &s;um|mary, concerning which I &s;hall &s;ay a few words.</P>
<P>Having been formerly concerned, according to an ap|pointment by act of a&s;&s;embly, in a review and dige&s;t of our provincial laws, it was the duty of my&s;elf, and my partner in that &s;ervice, to peru&s;e the minutes of the council, and the journals of the general a&s;&s;embly, from the glorious re|volution, at the acce&s;&s;ion of king William, to the year 1751: and as an acquaintance with our public tran&s;actions. was a branch of in&s;truction, of which a &s;tudent for the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the law ought not to be ignorant, I have &s;ince re-examined tho&s;e entries, beginning with the fir&s;t minutes of council, and read over many of the records in the &s;ecreta|ry's office. From the&s;e authentic materials, the following pages were, in a great mea&s;ure, compiled. For many of tho&s;e parts, which concern our affairs with the French and the Indians, antecedent to the peace of Ry&s;wick, in 1697, I am bound to make liberal acknowledgments to dr. Col|den, the author of the hi&s;tory of the five nations.</P>
<P>Mr. Alexander, a gentleman eminent in the law, and equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for his humanity, genero&s;ity, great abilities, and honourable &s;tations, &s;upplied me with &s;ome u&s;eful papers; and has left behind him a collection, that will be very &s;erviceable to any gentleman, who may here|after incline to continue this narrative, through the admi|ni&s;trations of mr. Co&s;by, and lieutenant governor Clarke. The draught of this work was unfini&s;hed, at the time of
<PB N="10" REF="024800_0007_0FCD626512D59820">mr. Alexander's decea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died on the 2d of April, 1756.</NOTE>: and therefore, as it never pa&s;&s;ed under his examination, many important additions are lo&s;t, which his long and intimate acquaintance with the affairs of this province would have enabled him to &s;upply.</P>
<P>When I began to frame this dige&s;t, it was only intended for private u&s;e; and the motives which now induce me to publi&s;h it, are the gratification of the pre&s;ent thir&s;t in Great Britain after American intelligences: contributing, as far as this province is concerned, to an accurate hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h empire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the provinces are different in their con&s;titutions, and, with re&s;pect to government, independent of each other; no general hi&s;tory of America can be expected, till gentlemen of lei&s;ure, will draw up particular accounts of the re&s;pective colonies, with which they are acquainted.</NOTE> in this quarter of the world; and the pro&s;pect of doing &s;ome &s;mall &s;ervice to my country, by laying before the public a &s;ummary account of its fir&s;t ri&s;e and pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>Influenced by the&s;e views, I am not &s;o regardle&s;s of the judgment of others, as not to wi&s;h it may be, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, acceptable. To plea&s;e all &s;orts of readers, I know is impo&s;&s;ible: he, who writes with &s;uch hopes, is a &s;tranger to human nature, and will be infallibly di&s;appointed. My de&s;ign is rather to inform than plea&s;e. He, who delights only in pages &s;hining with illu&s;trious characters, the con|tentions of armies, the ri&s;e and fall of empires, and other grand events, mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the great authors of antiquity. A detail of the little tran&s;actions, which concern a colony, &s;cant in its juri&s;diction, and &s;till &s;truggling with the difficulties naturally attending its infant &s;tate, to gentle|men of this ta&s;te can furni&s;h no entertainment. The en|&s;uing narrative (for it de&s;erves not the name of a hi&s;tory, though for brevity's &s;ake I have given it that title) pre|&s;ents us only a regular thread of &s;imple facts; and even tho&s;e unembelli&s;hed with reflexions, becau&s;e they them|&s;elves &s;ugge&s;t the proper remarks: and mo&s;t readers will, doubtle&s;s, be be&s;t plea&s;ed with their own. The &s;acred laws of truth have been infringed neither by po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, oblique, in&s;idious hints, wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ions, or corrupt mi&s;|repre&s;entation. To avoid any cen&s;ures of this kind, no reins have been given to a wanton imagination, for the in|vention of plau&s;ible tales, &s;upported only by light probabi|lities; but choo&s;ing rather to be hone&s;t and dull, than a|greeable
<PB N="11" REF="024800_0008_0FCD62668EFCF9A0">and fal&s;e, the true import of my vouchers hath been &s;trictly adhered to and regarded.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to its &s;ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, the critics, in that branch of literature, are at full liberty to condemn at their plea&s;ure. The main u&s;e of language is to expre&s;s our ideas. To write in the gay, plea&s;ing pomp of diction is above my capaci|ty. If any are di&s;po&s;ed to blame me for being too verbo&s;e, let it be remembered, that this is the indefea&s;ible right of my profe&s;&s;ion, founded upon immemorial pre&s;cription. Per|&s;picui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y is all I have endeavoured to maintain, nor am I at lei&s;ure to &s;tudy any higher attainments in language.</P>

<P>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, a Genoe&s;e, employed by Ferdinand and I&s;abel, king and queen of Ca&s;tile, was the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some authors allege, that Columbus fir&s;t offered his &s;ervices to the republic of Genoa; then to John II. of Por|tugal, and afterwards to our king Henry VII; but this di&s;|agrees with lord Bacon's account, who informs us, that Chri&s;topher Columbus failed, before his brother Bartholo|mew had laid the project before the king, which was owing to his falling into the hands of pirates, on his way to Eng|land.</NOTE> He failed from St. Lucar, in Augu&s;t, 1492 and made &s;ight of one of the Bahama i&s;lands, on the eleventh of October following. Newfound|land, and the main continent, were di&s;covered five years after, by Seba&s;tian Gaba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, a Venetian, in the &s;ervice of Henry VII. of England, from the 38th to the 68th degred of north latitude.</P>
<P>On the tenth of April, 1606, king James I. for plant|ing two colonies, pa&s;&s;ed the great North and South Virgi|nia patent. To &s;ir Thomas Gates and others, leave was gi|ven to begin a plantation, at any place on the continent, they &s;hould think convenient, between the 34th and 41&s;t degrees of latitude: and all the lands extending 50 miles,
<PB N="14" REF="024800_0010_0FCD626AED9FF650">on each &s;ide, along the coa&s;t, 100 miles into the country, and all the i&s;lands within 100 miles, oppo&s;ite to their plan|tations, were granted in fee, to be called the fir&s;t colony. By the &s;ame patent, a like quantity was granted to Tho|mas Henham, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and others, for a plantation between 38 and 45 degrees of latitude, under the name of the &s;econd colony. The fir&s;t began a &s;ettlement in the great bay (Che&s;|apeak) in 1607. The latter was planted at Plymouth in New-England, 1620.</P>
<P>Henry Hud&s;on, an Engli&s;hman, according to our au|thors, in the year 1608<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, a French Je&s;uit, author of the general hi&s;|tory of New France, thinks this di&s;covery was in 1609, Vol. I. 12^0. edition, p. 221. But Stith, Dougla&s;s, Oldmixen, and other Engli&s;h writers agree, that Hud&s;on's fir&s;t voyage was in the preceding year.</NOTE>, under a commi&s;&s;ion from the king his ma&s;ter, di&s;covered Long I&s;land, New-York, and the river which &s;till bears his name; and afterwards &s;old the country, or rather his right, to the Dutch. Their writers contend, that Hud&s;on was &s;ent out by the Ea&s;t-India com|pany, in 1609, to di&s;cover a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China; and that having fir&s;t di&s;covered Delaware Bay, he came hither, and penetrated up Hud&s;on's river, as far north as the latitude of 43^0. It is &s;aid, however, that there was a &s;ale, and that the Engli&s;h objected to it, though they for &s;ome time neglected to oppo&s;e the Dutch &s;ettlement of the country.</P>
<P>In 1610, Hud&s;on &s;ailed again from Holland to this coun|try, called by the Dutch, New-Netherlands; and four years after, the &s;tates general granted a patent to &s;undry merchants, for an exclu&s;ive trade on the North river, who in 1614 built a fort on the we&s;t &s;ide, near Albany, which was fir&s;t commanded by Henry Chri&s;tiaens. Captain Argal was &s;ent out by &s;ir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, in the &s;ame year, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the French of the two towns of Port royal and St. Croix, lying on each &s;ide of the bay of Fundy, in Acadia, then claimed as part of Virginia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix places this tran&s;action in 1613. Vol. I. Hi&s;t. of N. France in 12^0, p. 210. But Stith, whom I follow, being a clergyman in Virginia, had greater advantages of knowing the truth than the French Je&s;uit.</NOTE>. In his return, he vi&s;ited the Dutch on Hud&s;on's river, who, be|ing unable to re&s;i&s;t him, prudently &s;ubmitted for the pre|&s;ent to the king of England, and under him to the governor

<P>Determined upon the &s;ettlement of a colony, the &s;tates general made a grant of the country, in 1621, to the We&s;t-India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Am|&s;terdam, now New-York, and took upon him&s;elf the go|vernment, in June, 1629. His &s;tyle, in the patents granted by him, was thus, "We, director and council, re&s;iding in New-Netherland on the i&s;land Manhattans, under the government of their high mightine&s;&s;es, the lords &s;tates general of the united Netherlands, and the privileged We&s;t-India company." In his time, the New-England planters extended their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we&s;tward as far as Connecticut river.

If Kieft's let|ter, alludes to this affair, then Minuit preceded Van Twil|ler, in the chief command here; and being perhaps di&s;o|bliged by the Dutch, entered into the &s;ervice of the queen of Sweden.</NOTE>, who &s;eems, by the tenor of it, to be the Swedi&s;h governor of New Sweden, a&s;&s;ert|ing, "that the whole South river of New-Netherlands, had been in the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion many years above and be|low, be&s;et with forts, and &s;ealed with their blood." "Which," Kieft adds, "has happened even during your admini&s;tration in New-Netherland, and &s;o well known to you."</P>

<P>In 1640, the Engli&s;h, who had over&s;pread the ea&s;tern part of Long I&s;land, advanced to Oy&s;terbay. Kieft broke up their &s;ettlement in 1642, and fitted out two &s;loops to drive the Engli&s;h out of Schuylkill, of which the Mary|landers had lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves.

<P>We have no account, that the Engli&s;h acceded to the&s;e propo&s;als, nor is it probable, con&s;idering their &s;uperior &s;trength, that they ever did: on the contrary, they daily extended their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and, in 1642, the colonies of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New-Haven, entered into a league both again&s;t the Dutch and Indians, and grew &s;o powerful as to meet &s;hortly after, upon a de&s;ign of extirpating the former. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's bay declined this enterpri&s;e, which occa&s;ioned a letter to Oliver Cromwell, from William Hooke, dated at New-Ha|ven, November 3, 1653, in which he complains of the Dutch, for &s;upplying the natives with arms and ammuni|tion, begs his a&s;&s;i&s;tance with two or three frigates, and that letters might be &s;ent to the ea&s;tern colonies, command|ing them to join in an expedition again&s;t the Dutch colony, Oliver's affairs would not admit of &s;o di&s;tant an attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The war between him and the &s;tates, which began in July, 1652, was concluded by a peace on the fifth of April, 1654.

<P>Peter Stuyve&s;ant was the la&s;t Dutch governor; and though he had a commi&s;&s;ion in 1646, he did not begin his admini&s;tration till May 27, 1647. The inroads, and claims upon his government, kept him con&s;tantly employed. New-England on the ea&s;t, and Maryland, on the we&s;t, alarmed his fears by their daily increa&s;e; and about the &s;ame time, captain Forre&s;ter, a Scotchman, claimed Long I&s;land for the dowager of Stirling. The Swedes too were perpetual|ly incroaching upon Delaware. Through the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the mate, one De&s;wyck, a Swedi&s;h captain and &s;upercar|go, arrived in Raritan river. The &s;hip was &s;eized, and him|&s;elf made a pri&s;oner at New-Am&s;terdam. Stuyve&s;ant's rea|&s;ons were the&s;e. In 1651, the Dutch built fort Ca&s;imir, now called Newca&s;tle, on Delaware. The Swedes, indeed, claimed the country, and Printz, their governor, formally prote&s;ted again&s;t the works. Ri&s;ingh, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, under the di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, came before the fortre&s;s, fired two &s;alutes, and landed 30 men, who were entertained by
<PB N="19" REF="024800_0015_0FCD62734F1F8948">the commandant as friends: but he had no &s;ooner di&s;co|vered the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on, than he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, &s;eizing al&s;o upon all the ammunition, hou&s;es, and other effects of the We&s;t-India company, and compel|ling &s;everal of the people to &s;wear allegiance to Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden. The Dutch, in 1655, prepared to retake fort Ca&s;imir. Stuyve&s;ant commanded the forces in per&s;on, and arrived with them in Delaware, the 9th of September. A few days after, he anchored before the garri&s;on, and landed his troops. The fortre&s;s was immediately demanded as Dutch property: Suen Scutz, the commandant, de&s;ired leave to con&s;ult Ri&s;ingh, which being refu&s;ed, he &s;urrender|ed the 16th of September on articles of capitulation. The whole &s;trength of the place con&s;i&s;ted of four cannon, four|teen pounders, five &s;wivels, and a parcel of &s;mall arms, which were all delivered to the conquered. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort Chri&s;tina was commanded by Ri&s;ingh. Stuyve&s;ant came before it, and Ri&s;ingh &s;urrendered it upon terms, the 25th of Septem|ber. The country being thus &s;ubdued, the Dutch governor i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, in favour of &s;uch of the inhabitants, as would &s;ubmit to the new government, and about 30 Swedes &s;wore, "fidelity and obedience to the &s;tates general the lords directors of the We&s;t-India company, their &s;ubalterns of the province of New-Netherlands, and the director general then, or thereafter, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed." Ri&s;ingh and one El&s;wych, a trader of note, were ordered to France, or England, and the re&s;t of the Swedi&s;h inhabi|tants to Holland, and from thence to Gottenberg. The Swedes being thus extirpated, the Dutch became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay, now called the Three lower counties.</P>
<P>This country was afterwards under the command of lieutenant-governors, &s;ubject to the controul of, and com|mi&s;&s;ioned by, the director general at New-Am&s;terdam. Jo|han Paul Jaquet was the fir&s;t vice director, or lieutenant-governor, of South river. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were Alricks, Hino|jo&s;&s;a, and William Beekman. The po&s;terity of the la&s;t re|mains among&s;t us to this day. The&s;e lieutenants had power to grant lands, and their patents make a part of the ancient titles of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Alricks' commi&s;&s;ion, of the 12th of April, 1657, &s;hows the extent of the Dutch claim on the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware at that time. He was appoint|ed "director general of the colony of the South river of New-Netherlands, and the fortre&s;s of Ca&s;imir, now called Niewer Am&s;tel, with all the lands depending thereon, according to the fir&s;t purcha&s;e and deed of relea&s;e of the

Of the country northward of the kiln, no mention is made. Orders in 1658 were given to William Beekman to purcha&s;e Cape Hinlopen from the natives, and to &s;ettle and fortify it, which, for want of goods, was not done till the &s;ucceeding year.</P>
<P>In the year 1659, fre&s;h troubles aro&s;e from the Maryland claim to the lands on South river: and in September, colo|nel Nathaniel Utie, as commi&s;&s;ioner from Fendal, lord Balti|more's governor, arrived at Niewer Am&s;tel from Maryland. The country was ordered to be evacuated, lord Baltimore claiming all the land, between 38 and 40 degrees of lati|tude, from &s;ea to &s;ea. Beekman and his council demanded evidence of his lord&s;hip's right, and offered to prove the &s;tates general's grant to the We&s;t-India company, their payment to them, for the land and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and upon the whole, propo&s;ed to refer the controver&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the repub|lics of England and Holland, praying, at the &s;ame time, three weeks to con&s;ult Stuyve&s;ant, the general. The com|mi&s;&s;ioner, notwith&s;tanding, a few days after, warned him to draw off, beyond latitude 40&deg;: but Beekman di&s;regard|ed the threat. Colonel Utie thereupon returned to Mary|land; and an immediate inva&s;ion was expected.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring of the year 1660, Nicholas Varleth, and Brian Newton, were di&s;patched from fort Am&s;terdam, to Virginia, in quality of amba&s;&s;adors, with full power to open a trade, and conclude a league, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, again&s;t the barbarians. William Berckley, the governor, gave them a kind reception, and approved their propo&s;al of peace and commerce, which &s;ir Henry Moody was &s;ent here to agree upon and perfect. Four articles, to that pur|po&s;e, were drawn up, and &s;ent to the governor for confir|mation. Stuyve&s;ant artfully endeavoured, at this treaty, to procure an acknowledgment of the Dutch title to the country, which Berckley as carefully avoided. This was his an&s;wer.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Governor Stuyve&s;ant was a faithful &s;ervant to the We&s;t-India company: this is abundantly proved by his letters to them, exciting their care of the colony. In one, dated April 20, 1660, which is very long and pathetic, repre&s;ent|ing the de&s;perate &s;ituation of affairs on both &s;ides of the New-Netherland, he writes, "your honours ima|gine, that the troubles in England will prevent any at|tempt on the&s;e parts: alas! they are ten to one in num|ber to us, and are able, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to deprive us of the country when they plea&s;e." On the 25th of June, the &s;ame year, he informs them, "that the demands, encroachments, and u&s;urpations, of the Engli&s;h, give the people here great concern. The right to both rivers, &s;ays he, by purcha&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is our own, without di&s;pute. We apprehend, that they, our more powerful neighbours, lay their claims under a royal patent, which we are unable hitherto to do in your name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If we &s;hould argue, from this letter, that the We&s;t-In|dia company had no grants of the New Netherlands, from the &s;tates general, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, we di&s;credit De Laet's hi&s;tory, dedicated to the &s;tates in 1624, as well as all the Dutch writers, and even Stuyve&s;ant him&s;elf, who in his letter to Richard Nicolls, at the &s;urrender, a&s;&s;erts that they had a grant, and &s;howed it under &s;eal to the Engli&s;h depu|ties. But the genuine con&s;truction of the Dutch governor's letter, is this, that in 1660, he had not the patent to the We&s;t-India company, to lay before the Engli&s;h in America, who di&s;puted the Dutch right to this country.</NOTE> Colonel
<PB N="22" REF="024800_0018_0FCD627B1BC8D6B8">Utie being un&s;ucce&s;sful the la&s;t year, in his emba&s;&s;y for the evacuation of the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on Delaware, lord Balti|more, in autumn 1660, applied, by captain Neal, his agent, to the We&s;t-India company, in Holland, for an order on the inhabitants of South river, to &s;ubmit to his authority, which they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, a&s;&s;erting their right to that part of their colony.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, from New-England, were every day en|croaching upon the Dutch. The following letter, from Stuyve&s;ant to the We&s;t-India company, dated July 21, 1661, &s;hows the &s;tate of the colony at that time, on both &s;ides. "We have not yet begun the fort on Long-I&s;land, near Oy&s;terbay, becau&s;e our neighbours lay the boundaries a mile and a half more we&s;terly, than we do; and the more, as your honours, by your advice of December 24, are not inclined to &s;tand by the treaty of Hartford, and propo&s;e to &s;ue for redre&s;s on Long I&s;land and the Fre&s;h Water river, by means of the &s;tates' amba&s;&s;ador. Lord Sterling is &s;aid to &s;olicit a confirmation of his right to all Long I&s;land, and importunes the pre&s;ent king, to confirm the grant made by his royal father, which is affirmed to be already obtained. But more probable, and material, is the advice from Mary|land, that lord Baltimore's patent, which contains the &s;outh part of South river, is confirmed by the king and publi&s;hed in print: that lord Baltimore's natural brother, who is a rigid papi&s;t, being made governor there, has received lord Baltimore's claim, and prote&s;t to your honours in council, (where with he &s;eems but little &s;atisfied) and has now more hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. We have advice from England, that there is an inva&s;ion intended again&s;t the&s;e parts, and the country &s;olicited of the king, the duke and the parliament, is to be annexed to their dominions; and for that purpo&s;e, they de&s;ire three or four frigates, per&s;uading the King, that the company po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and held this country under an unlaw|ful title, having only obtained of king James, leave for a watering place on Staten I&s;land, in 1623."</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1663, a &s;hip arrived from Holland at South river, with new planters, ammunition, and implements of hu&s;bandry. Lord Baltimore's &s;on landed a little after, and was entertained by Beekman at Niewer Am&s;tel. This was Charles, the &s;on of Cecilius, who in 1661, had procured a grant and confirmation of the patent, pa&s;&s;ed in favour of
<PB N="23" REF="024800_0019_0FCD627CE6B13E30">his father in 1632. The papi&s;tical principles of the Balti|more family, the charge of colonizing, the parliamentary was with Charles I. and Oliver's u&s;urpation, all con&s;pired to impede the &s;ettlement of Maryland, till the year 1661. And the&s;e con&s;iderations account for the exten&s;ion of the Dutch limits, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay.</P>
<P>While the Dutch were contending with their European neighbours, they had the art always to maintain a friend|&s;hip with the natives, until the war which broke out this year with the Indians at E&s;opus, now Ul&s;ter county. It con|tinued, however, but a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on. The five nations never gave them any di&s;turbance, which was owing to their con|tinual wars with the French, who &s;ettled at Canada, in 1603. I have before ob&s;erved, that Oliver Cromwell was applied to, for his aid in the reduction of this country, and that his &s;on Richard took &s;ome &s;teps towards accompli&s;hing the &s;cheme. The work was however re&s;erved for the reign of Charles II. an indolent prince, and entirely given up to plea&s;ure, who was driven to it, more, perhaps, by the dif|ferences then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between England and Holland, than by any motive that might reflect honour upon his prudence, activity, and public &s;pirit. Before this expedition, the king granted a patent, on the 12th of March, 1664, to his brother the duke of York and Albany, for &s;undry tracts of land in America, the boundaries of which, becau&s;e they have given ri&s;e to important and animated debates, it may not be im|proper to tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P>"All that part of the main land of New-England, begin|ning at a certain place, called or known by the name of St. Croix, next adjoining to New-Scotland in America, and from thence extending along the &s;ea coa&s;t, unto a certain place called Pemaquie, or Pemequid, and &s;o up the river thereof, to the furthe&s;t head of the &s;ame, as it tendeth northward; and extending from thence, to the river of Kimbequin, and &s;o upwards, by the &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e, to the river Canada, northward: and al&s;o all that i&s;land, or i&s;lands, commonly called by the &s;everal name or names of Meito|wacks, or Long I&s;land, &s;ituate and being towards the we&s;t of cape Cod, and the narrow Higan&s;etts, abutting upon the main land, between the two rivers, there called or known by the &s;everal names of Connecticut and Hud&s;on's river, together al&s;o with the &s;aid river, called Hud&s;on's river, and all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecticut river, to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay, and al&s;o, all tho&s;e &s;everal i&s;lands, called or known by the names of Martin's Vineyard, or Nan|tuck's, otherwi&s;e Nantucket: together, &amp;c."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="024800_0020_0FCD627DD3EC4BC8">
Part of this tract was conveyed by the duke, to John Lord Berkley, baron of Stratton, and &s;ir George Carteret, of Sal|trum, in Devon, who were then members of the king's council. The lea&s;e was for the con&s;ideration of ten &s;hil|lings, and dated the 23d of June, 1664. The relea&s;e, dated the next day, mentions no particular &s;um of money, as a con&s;ideration for the grant of the lands, which have the fol|lowing de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"All that tract of land, adjacent to New-England, and lying and being to the we&s;tward of Long I&s;land, and bound|ed on the ea&s;t part by the main &s;ea, and part by Hud&s;on's river; and hath, upon the we&s;t, Delaware bay, or river, and extendeth &s;outhward, to the main ocean as far as Cape May, at the mouth of Delaware bay: and to the north|ward, as far as the northermo&s;t branch of the &s;aid bay or river of Delaware, which is forty one degrees and forty minutes of latitude: which &s;aid tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name, or names, of Nova Cae&s;area, or New-Jer&s;ey."</P>
<P>Thus the New Netherlands became divided into New-Jer&s;ey, &s;o called after the i&s;le of Jer&s;ey, in compliment to &s;ir George Carteret, who&s;e family came from thence; and New York, which took its name in honour of the duke of York.</P>
<P>The Dutch inhabitants by the vigilance of their governor, were not unappri&s;ed of the de&s;igns of the Engli&s;h court again&s;t them; for their records te&s;tify, that on the 8th of July, "the general received intelligence, from one Thomas Willet, an Engli&s;hman, that an expedition was preparing in England, again&s;t this place, con&s;i&s;ting of two frigates of 40 and 50 guns, and a fly boat of 40 guns, having on board 300 &s;oldiers, and each frigate 150 men, and that they then lay at Port&s;mouth, waiting for a wind." News arrived al&s;o from Bo&s;ton, that they had already &s;et &s;ail. The burgoma&s;|ters were thereupon called into council. The fortre&s;s was ordered to be put into a po&s;ture of defence, and &s;pies &s;ent to Milford and We&s;t-che&s;ter for intelligence. Bo&s;ton was in the &s;ecret of the expedition; for the general court had, in May preceding, pa&s;&s;ed a vote for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, to|wards refre&s;hing the &s;hips on their arrival. They were four in number, and re&s;olved to rendezvous at Gardener's i&s;land, in the Sound, but parted in a fog, about the 20th of July. Richard Nicolls, and &s;ir George Carteret, two of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, were on board the Guyny, and fell in fir&s;t with Cape Cod. The winds having blown from the &s;outh we&s;t, the other &s;hips, with &s;ir Robert Carr, and mr. Mavenick,
<PB N="25" REF="024800_0021_0FCD627F9803DF78">the remaining commi&s;&s;ioners, were rightly concluded to be driven to the ea&s;tward. After di&s;patching a letter to mr. Winthrop, the governor of Connecticut, reque&s;ting his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, col. Nicolls proceeded to Nama&s;ket, and thence to Bo&s;ton. The other &s;hips got into Pi&s;cataway. John Endicot, a very old man, was then governor of Bo&s;ton, and incapa|ble of bu&s;ine&s;s. The commi&s;&s;ioners, therefore, had a con|ference with the council, and earne&s;tly implored the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that colony. Col. Nicolls and &s;ir George Carteret, in their letter from Bo&s;ton, to &s;ir H. Bennet, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, complain much of the backwardne&s;s of that province. The rea&s;ons urged in their excu&s;e, were poverty and the &s;ea&s;on, it being the time of harve&s;t; but perhaps di&s;affec|tion to the Stuart family, who&s;e per&s;ecuting fury had driven them from their native country, was the true &s;pring of their conduct.

<P>Mr. Stuyve&s;ant promi&s;ed an an&s;wer to the &s;ummons the next morning, and in the mean time convened the council and burgoma&s;ters. The Dutch governor was a good &s;oldier, and had lo&s;t a leg in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates. He would willingly have made a defence; and refu&s;ed a &s;ight of the &s;ummons, both to the inhabitants and burgoma&s;ters, le&s;t the ea&s;y terms offered, might induce them to capitulate. The latter, however, in&s;i&s;ted upon a copy, that they might communicate it to the late magi&s;trates and principal burghers. They called together the inhabitants at the &s;tadt|hou&s;e, and acquainted them with the governor's refu&s;al. Governor Winthrop, at the &s;ame time, wrote to the di|rector and his council, &s;trongly recommending a &s;urrender. On the 22d of Augu&s;t, the burgoma&s;ters came again into council, and de&s;ired to know the contents of the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;age from governor Winthrop, which Stuyve&s;ant &s;till refu&s;ed. They continued their importunity; and he, in a fit of anger, tore it to piecee: upon which they prote&s;ted again&s;t the act, and all its con&s;equences. Determined upon a defence of the country, Stuyve&s;ant wrote a letter in an|&s;wer to the &s;ummons, which, as it is hi&s;torical of the Dutch claim, will doubtle&s;s be acceptable to the reader. The fol|lowing is an exact tran&s;cript of the record.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR fir&s;t letter, un&s;igned, of the 20/31 Augu&s;t, together with that of this day, &s;igned according to form, be|ing the fir&s;t of September, have been &s;afely delivered into our hands by your deputies; unto which we &s;hall &s;ay, that the rights of his maje&s;ty of England, unto any part of America hereabout, among&s;t the re&s;t, unto the colonies of Virginia, Maryland, or others in New-England, whe|ther di&s;putable or not, is that which, for the pre&s;ent, we have no de&s;ign to debate upon. But that his maje&s;ty hath an indi&s;putable right, to all the lands in the north parts of America, is that, which the kings of France and Spain will di&s;allow, as we ab&s;olutely do, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion given to me, by my lords, the high and mighty &s;tates ge|neral, to be governor general, over New-Holland, the i&s;le
<PB N="28" REF="024800_0024_0FCD6289CE30FAF8">of Curacoa, Bonaire, Aruba, with their appurtenances and dependencies, bearing date the 26th of July, 1646; as al&s;o by virtue of a grant and commi&s;&s;ion; given by my &s;aid lords, the high and mighty &s;tates general, to the We&s;t-India compa|ny, in the year 1621, with as much power and as authentic, as his &s;aid maje&s;ty of England hath given, or can give, to any colony in America, as more fully appears by the patent and commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid lords the &s;tates general, by them &s;igned, regi&s;tered, and &s;ealed with their great &s;eal, which were &s;howed to your deputies, colonel George Carteret, cap|tain Robert Needham, captain Edward Groves, and mr. Thomas Delavall; by which commi&s;&s;ion and patent, toge|ther (to deal frankly with you) and by divers letters, &s;ign|ed and &s;ealed by our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, directed to &s;everal per&s;ons, both Engli&s;h and Dutch, inhabiting the towns and villages on Long I&s;land, (which, without doubt, have been produced before you, by tho&s;e inhabitants) by which they are declared and acknowledged to be their &s;ubjects, with expre&s;s command, that they continue faithful unto them, under penalty of incurring their utmo&s;t di&s;plea|&s;ure, which makes it appear more clear than the &s;un at noon-day, that your fir&s;t, foundation, viz. that the right and title of his maje&s;ty of Great Britain, to the&s;e parts of America, is unque&s;tionable, is ab&s;olutely to be denied. Moreover, it is without di&s;pute, and acknowledged by the world, that our predece&s;&s;ors, by virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion and patent of the &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, have, with|out controul and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange, about 48 or 50 years, the Manhattans about 41 or 42 years, the South river 40 years, and the Fre&s;h Water river about 36 years.</P>
<P>Touching the &s;econd &s;ubject of your letter, viz. "His maje&s;ty hath commanded me, in his name, to require a &s;ur|render of all &s;uch forts, towns, or places of &s;trength, which now are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch, under your command;" we &s;hall an&s;wer, that we are &s;o confident of the di&s;cretion and equity of his maje&s;ty of Great Britain, that in ca&s;e his ma|je&s;ty were informed of the truth, which is, that the Dutch came not into the&s;e provinces, by any violence, but by vir|tue of commi&s;&s;ions from my lords, the &s;tates general, fir&s;t of all in the years 1614, 1615, and 1616, up the North Ri|ver near fort Orange, where, to hinder the inva&s;ions and ma&s;&s;acres, commonly committed by the &s;avages, they built a little fort, and after in the year 1622, and even to this pre&s;ent time, by virtue of commi&s;&s;ion and grant, to the go|vernors of the We&s;t India company; and moreover, in the
<PB N="29" REF="024800_0025_0FCD628BD8822F68">year 1656, a grant to the honourable the burgoma&s;ters of Am&s;terdam, of the South River; in&s;omuch, that by virtue of the above&s;aid commi&s;&s;ions from the high and mighty &s;tates general, given to the per&s;ons intere&s;ted as afore&s;aid, and others, the&s;e provinces have been governed, and con&s;equent|ly enjoyed, as al&s;o in regard of their fir&s;t di&s;covery, unin|terrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and purcha&s;e of the lands of the princes, natives of the country, and other private per&s;ons (though gentiles) we make no doubt, that if his &s;aid ma|je&s;ty of Great Britain, were well-informed of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, he would be too judicious to grant &s;uch an order, principally in a time when there is &s;o &s;trait a friend&s;hip, and confederacy, between our &s;aid lords and &s;uperiors, to trouble us in the demanding and &s;ummons of the places and fortre&s;&s;es, which were put into our hands, with order to maintain them, in the name of the &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, as was made appear to your deputies, under the names and &s;eal of the &s;aid high and mighty &s;tates general, dated the 28th of July 1646. Be&s;ides what hath been men|tioned, there is little probability, that his &s;aid maje&s;ty of England (in regard the articles of peace are printed, and were recommended to us to ob&s;erve &s;eriou&s;ly and exactly, by a letter written to us by our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, and to cau&s;e them to be ob&s;erved religiou&s;ly in this coun|try) would give order touching &s;o dangerous a de&s;ign, being al&s;o &s;o apparent, that none other than my &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, have any right to the&s;e provinces, and con|&s;equently ought to command and maintain their &s;ubjects, and in their ab&s;ence, we, the governor general, are obliged to maintain their rights, and to repel and take revenge of all threatenings, unju&s;t attempts, or any force what&s;oever, that &s;hall be committed again&s;t their faithful &s;ubjects and inhabitants; it being a very con&s;iderable thing, to affront &s;o mighty a &s;tate, although it were not again&s;t an ally and confederate. Con&s;equently, if his &s;aid maje&s;ty (as it is fit) were well informed, of all that could be &s;poken upon this &s;ubject, he would not approve of what expre&s;&s;ions were mentioned in your letter; which are, that you are com|manded by his maje&s;ty, to demand in his name, &s;uch places and fortre&s;&s;es as are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch under my government; which, as it appears by my commi&s;&s;ion before mentioned, was given me by my lords, the high and mighty &s;tates general. And there is le&s;s ground in the ex|pre&s;s demand of my government, &s;ince all the world knows, that about three years ago, &s;ome Engli&s;h frigates being on the coa&s;t of Africa, upon a pretended commi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="024800_0026_0FCD628D0713EF78">they did demand certain places under the government of our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, as Cape Vert, river of Gam|bo, and all other places in Guyny, to them belonging. Up|on which, our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, by virtue of the articles of peace, having made appear the &s;aid attempt to his maje&s;ty of England, they received a favourable an|&s;wer, his &s;aid maje&s;ty di&s;allowing all &s;uch acts of ho&s;tility, as might have been done, and, be&s;ides, gave order, that re|&s;titution &s;hould be made, to the Ea&s;t India company, of what&s;oever had been pillaged, in the &s;aid river of Gambo; and likewi&s;e re&s;tored them to their trade, which makes us think it nece&s;&s;ary, that a more expre&s;s order &s;hould appear unto us, as a &s;ufficient warrant for us, towards my lords, the high and mighty &s;tates general, &s;ince by virtue of our &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, we do, in the&s;e provinces, repre&s;ent them, as belonging to them, and not to the king of Great Britain, except his &s;aid maje&s;ty, upon better grounds, make it ap|pear to our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, again&s;t which they may defend them&s;elves, as they &s;hall think fit. To con|clude: we cannot but declare unto you, though the gover|nors and commi&s;&s;ioners of his maje&s;ty have divers times quarrelled with us, about the bounds of the juri&s;diction or the high and mighty the &s;tates general, in the&s;e parts, yet they never que&s;tioned their juri&s;diction it&s;elf; on the contrary, in the year 1650, at Hartford, and the la&s;t year at Bo&s;ton, they treated with us upon this &s;ubject, which is a &s;ufficient proof, that his maje&s;ty hath never been well-in|formed, of the equity of our cau&s;e, in&s;omuch as we cannot imagine, in regard of the articles of peace, between the crown of England and the &s;tates general, (under whom there are &s;o many &s;ubjects in America, as well as Europe) that his &s;aid maje&s;ty of Great-Britain would give a com|mi&s;&s;ion to mole&s;t and endamage the &s;ubjects of my &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, e&s;pecially &s;uch, as ever &s;ince 50, 40, and the late&s;t 36 years, have quietly enjoyed their lands, countries, forts, and inheritances: and le&s;s, that his &s;ub|jects would attempt any acts of ho&s;tility, or violence again&s;t them: and in ca&s;e that you will act by force of arms, we prote&s;t and declare, in the name of our &s;aid lords, the &s;tates general, before God and men, that you will act an unju&s;t violence, and a breach of the articles of peace, &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn, agreed upon, and ratified by his maje&s;ty of England, and my lords, the &s;tates general, and the ra|ther, for that to prevent the &s;hedding of blood, in the month of February la&s;t, we treated with captain John. Scott, (who reported he had a commi&s;&s;ion from his &s;aid maje&s;ty) touching the limits of Long I&s;land, and concluded for the
<PB N="31" REF="024800_0027_0FCD6290154CD1E0">&s;pace of a year; that in the mean time, the bu&s;ine&s;s might be treated on between the king of Great Britain, and my lords, the high and mighty &s;tates general: and again, at pre&s;ent, for the hindrance and prevention of all differences, and the &s;pilling of innocent blood, not only in the&s;e parts, but al&s;o in Europe, we offer unto you, a treaty by our de|puties, mr. Cornelius Van Ruyven, &s;ecretary, and receiver of New Holland, Cornelius Steenwick, burgoma&s;ter, mr. Samuel Megapolen&s;is, doctor of phy&s;ic, and mr. James Cou&s;&s;eau, heretofore &s;heriff. As touching the threats in your conclu&s;ion, we have nothing to an&s;wer, only that we fear nothing, but what God (who is as ju&s;t as merciful) &s;hall lay upon us; all things being in his gracious di&s;po&s;al, and we may as well be pre&s;erved by him, with &s;mall forces, as by a great army, which makes us to wi&s;h you all happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, and recommend you to his protection. My lords, your thrice humble and affectionate &s;ervant and friend, &s;igned, P. Stuyve&s;ant.&mdash;At the fort at Am&s;terdam, the &s;econd of September, new &s;tile, 1664."</P>
<P>While the Dutch governor and council were contending with the burgoma&s;ters and people in the city, the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners publi&s;hed a proclamation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was in the&s;e words: "Fora&s;much as his maje&s;ty hath &s;ent us (by commi&s;&s;ion under his great &s;eal of England) among&s;t other things, to expel, or to reduce to his maje&s;|ty's obedience all &s;uch foreigners as without his maje&s;ty's leave and con&s;ent, have &s;eated them&s;elves among&s;t any of his dominions in America, to the prejudice of his maje&s;|ty's &s;ubjects, and diminution of his royal dignity; we, his &s;aid maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners, do declare and promi&s;e, that who&s;oever, of what nation &s;oever, will, upon knowledge of this proclamation, acknowledge and te&s;tify them&s;elves, to &s;ubmit to this his maje&s;ty's government, as his good &s;ub|jects, &s;hall be protected in his maje&s;ty's laws and ju&s;tice, and peaceably enjoy what&s;oever God's ble&s;&s;ing, and their own hone&s;t indu&s;try, have furni&s;hed them with; and all other privileges, with his maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.

A warrant was al&s;o i&s;&s;ued to Hugh Hide, who com|manded the &s;quadron, to pro&s;ecute the reduction of the fort; and an Engli&s;h &s;hip, then trading here, was pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice. The&s;e preparations induced Stuyve&s;ant to write another letter, on the 25th of Augu&s;t, old &s;tyle, where|in, though he declares that he would &s;tand the &s;torm, yet to prevent the &s;pilling of blood, he had &s;ent John de Decker, coun&s;ellor of &s;tate, Cornelius Van Riven, &s;ecretary and re|ceiver, Cornelius Steenwyck, major, and James Cou&s;&s;eau, &s;heriff, to con&s;ult, if po&s;&s;ible, an accommodation. Nicolls, who knew the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, an&s;wered imme|diately from Grave&s;end, that he would treat about nothing but a &s;urrender. The Dutch governor, the next day, agreed to a treaty and &s;urrender, on condition the Engli&s;h and Dutch limits in America, were &s;ettled by the crown and the &s;tates general. The Engli&s;h deputies were, &s;ir Robert Carr, George Carteret, John Winthrop, governor of Connecticut, Samuel Wyllys, one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants or council of that colo|ny, and Thomas Clarke, and John Pynchon, commi&s;&s;ioners from the general court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, who, but a little before, brought an aid from that province. What the&s;e per&s;ons agreed upon, Nicolls promi&s;ed to ratify. At eight o'clock in the morning, of the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1664, the commi&s;&s;ioners, on both &s;ides, met at the governor's farm, and there &s;igned the following articles of capitula|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles following were con&s;ented to by the per|&s;ons hereunder &s;ub&s;cribed, at the governor's bowery, Aug. the 27th, old &s;tile, 1664.</P>

<ITEM>I.

<P>The&s;e articles, favourable as they were to the inhabitants, were however very di&s;agreeable to the Dutch governor; and he therefore refu&s;ed to ratify them, till two days after they were &s;igned by the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>The town of New-Am&s;terdam, upon the reduction of the i&s;land Manhattans, took the name of New-York. It con&s;i&s;t|ed of &s;everal &s;mall &s;treets, laid out in the year 1656, and was not incon&s;iderable for the number of its hou&s;es and in|habitants. The ea&s;y terms of the capitulation, promi&s;ed their peaceable &s;ubjection to the new government; and hence we find, that in two days after the &s;urrender, the Bo&s;ton aid was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with the thanks of the commi&s;|&s;ioners to the general court. Hud&s;on's and the South river were, however, &s;till to be reduced. Sir Robert Carr com|manded the expedition on Delaware, and Carteret was commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;ubdue the Dutch at fort Orange. The garri&s;on capitulated on the 24th of September, and he cal|led it Albany, in honour of the duke. While Carteret was here, he had an interview with the Indians of the five na|tions, and entered into a league of friend&s;hip with them, which remarkably continues to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutch were &s;en&s;ible of the importance of pre&s;erv|ing an uninterrupted amity with tho&s;e Indians, for they were both very numerous and warlike. The French pur|&s;ued quite different mea&s;ures, and the irruptions of tho&s;e tribes, according to their own authors, have often reduced Canada to the brink of ruin.</NOTE>. Sir Robert Carr was equally &s;ucce&s;sful on South river; for he compelled both
<PB N="36" REF="024800_0032_0FCD629BA3ED4018">the Dutch and Swedes, to capitulate and deliver up their garri&s;ons the fir&s;t of October, 1664; and that was the day in which the whole New-Netherlands became &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h crown. Very few of the inhabitants thought proper to remove out of the country. Governor Stuyve&s;ant him|&s;elf held his e&s;tate, and died here. His remains were inter|red in a chapel, which he had erected on his own farm, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the city, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his grand&s;on Gerardus Stuyve&s;ant, a man of probity, who has been elect|ed into the magi&s;tracy, above thirty years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Ju&s;|tice obliges me to declare, that for loyalty to the pre&s;ent reigning family, and a pure attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, the de&s;cendents of the Dutch planters, are per|haps exceeded by none of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART II.</HI> From the &s;urrender in <HI>1664,</HI> to the &s;ettlement at the revolution.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD NICOLLS being now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the country, took the government upon him, under the &s;tile of "deputy-governor under his royal highne&s;s the duke of York, of all his territories in America." During his &s;hort continuance here, he pa&s;&s;ed a va&s;t number of grants and confirmations of the ancient Dutch patents, the profits of which mu&s;t have been very con&s;iderable. Among the&s;e, no one has occa&s;ioned more animated contention, than that called the Elizabethtown grant, in New-Jer&s;ey; which, as it relates to another colony, I &s;hould not have mentioned, but for the opportunity to caution the reader again&s;t the repre&s;entation of that controver&s;y contained in Dougla&s;s's &s;ummary.

At the time of this determination, about two thirds of Long I&s;land were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by people from New-England, who had gradually encroached upon the Dutch. As to the &s;ettlement between New York and Connecticut on the main, it has always been con&s;idered by the former, as founded upon ignorance and fraud<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town of Rye was &s;ettled under Connecticut; and the grant from that colony is bounded by this line of di|vi&s;ion.</NOTE>. The &s;tation at Mama|roneck was about 30 miles from New York, from Albany 150. The general cour&s;e of the river is about north 12 or 150 ea&s;t: and hence it is evident, that a north-north-we&s;t line will &s;oon inter&s;ect the river, and con&s;equently leave the Dutch country, but a little before &s;urrendered to col. Carteret, out of the province of New-York. It has been generally e&s;teemed, that the Connecticut commi&s;&s;ioners in this affair, took advantage of the duke's agents, who were ignorant of the geography of the country.</P>
<P>About the clo&s;e of the year, the e&s;tate of the We&s;t-India company was &s;eized and confi&s;cated, ho&s;tilities being ac|tually commenced in Europe as well as America, though no declarations of war had yet been publi&s;hed by either of the contending parties. A great di&s;pute between the inhabi|tants of Jamaica on Long I&s;land, which was adju&s;ted by col. Nicolls, on the 2d of January, 1665, gave ri&s;e to a &s;alutary in&s;titution, which has in part obtained ever &s;ince. The con|trover&s;y re&s;pected Indian deeds; and thenceforth it was ordained, that no purcha&s;e from the Indians, without the governor's licen&s;e, executed in his pre&s;ence, &s;hould be valid. The &s;trength and numbers of the natives rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to purcha&s;e their rights; and to prevent their fre|quent &s;elling the &s;ame tract, it was expedient, that the bar|gain &s;hould be attended with &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;olem|nity.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of col. Nicolls's prudence, was his gra|dual introduction of the Engli&s;h methods of government. It was not till the 12th of June, this year, that he incorpo|rated the inhabitants of New York, under the care of a mayor, five aldermen, and a &s;heriff. Till this time, the ci|ty was ruled by a &s;cout, burgoma&s;ters, and &s;chepens.</P>
<P>In March preceding, there was a great convention, be|fore the governor at Hemp&s;tead, of two deputies from every town on Long I&s;land, empowered to bind their con|&s;tituents. The de&s;ign of their meeting was to adju&s;t the li|mits
<PB N="40" REF="024800_0036_0FCD62A28F7B70A0">of their town&s;hips for the pre&s;ervation of the public peace.</P>
<P>The war being proclaimed at London, on the fourth of this month, Nicolls received the account of it in June, with a letter from the lord chancellor, informing him, that de Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, had orders to vi&s;it New York. His lord&s;hip was mi&s;informed, or the admiral was diverted from the enterpri&s;e; for the Engli&s;h peaceably held the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country during the whole war, which was concluded on the 21&s;t of July, 1667, by the treaty of Broda. Some are of opinion, that the exchange made with the Dutch for Surinam, which they had taken from us, was ad|vantageous to the nation: but the&s;e judges do not con&s;ider, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the Dutch to have pre&s;erved this colony again&s;t the increa&s;ing &s;trength of the people in New-England, Maryland, and Virginia.</P>
<P>After an admini&s;tration of three years, Nicolls returned to England. The time, during his &s;hort re&s;idence here, was almo&s;t wholly taken up in confirming the ancient Dutch grants. He erected no courts of ju&s;tice, but took upon him|&s;elf the &s;ole deci&s;ion of all controver&s;ies what&s;oever. Com|plaints came before him by petition; upon which he gave a day to the parties, and, after a &s;ummary hearing, pro|nounced judgment. His determinations were called edicts, and executed by the &s;heriffs he had appointed. It is much to his honour, that notwith&s;tanding all this plenitude of power, he governed the province with integrity and mode|ration. A repre&s;entation from the inhabitants of Long I&s;land, to the general court of Connecticut, made about the time of the revolution, commends him as a man of an ea&s;y and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition: and this te&s;timonial is the more to be relied upon, becau&s;e the de&s;ign of the writers, was by a detail of their grievances, to induce the colony of Con|necticut to take them under its immediate protection.</P>
<P>Francis Lovelace, a colonel, was appointed by the duke, to &s;ucceed Nicolls in the government of the province, which he began to exerci&s;e in May, 1667. As he was a man of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat moderation, the people lived very peaceably under him, till the re-&s;urrender of the colony, which put an end to his power, and is the only event, that &s;ignalized his ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The ambitious de&s;igns of Louis XIV. again&s;t the Dutch, gave ri&s;e to our war with the &s;tates general in 1672. Charles II. a prince &s;unk in plea&s;ures, pro&s;ligate, and poor, was ea&s;ily detached from his alliance with the Dutch, by the intrigues and pecuniary promi&s;es of the French king. The
<PB N="41" REF="024800_0037_0FCD62A6CF52AF08">following pa&s;&s;age from a fine writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire's age of Louis XIV.</NOTE>, &s;hows that his pre|tences for entering into the war, were perfectly groundle&s;s and trifling.</P>
<P>"The king of England, on his &s;ide, reproached them with di&s;re&s;pect, in not directing their fleet to lower the flag be|fore an Engli&s;h &s;hip: and they were al&s;o accu&s;ed in regard to a certain picture, wherein Cornelius de Witt, brother to the pen&s;ionary, war painted with the attributes of a conque|ror. Ships were repre&s;ented in the back ground of the piece, either taken or burnt. Cornelius de Witt, who had really had a great &s;hare in the maritime exploits again&s;t England, had permitted this trifling memorial of his glory: but the picture, which was in a manner unknown, was depo&s;ited in a chamber wherein &s;carce any body ever entered. The Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, who pre&s;ented the complaints of their king again&s;t Holland, in writing, therein mentioned certain abu&s;ive pictures. The &s;tates, who always tran&s;lated the me|morials of amba&s;&s;adors into French, having rendered abu|&s;ive, by the words <HI>fautifs trompeurs,</HI> they replied, that they did not know what the&s;e <HI>rogui&s;h pictures (ces tableaux trompeurs)</HI> were. In reality, it never in the lea&s;t entered into their thoughts, that it concerned this portrait of one of their citizens; nor did they ever conceive this could be a pretence for declaring war."</P>
<P>A few Dutch &s;hips arrived the year after, on the 30th of July, under Staten i&s;land, at the di&s;tance of a few miles from the city of New York. John Manning, a captain of an independent company, had at that time the command of the fort, and by a me&s;&s;enger, &s;ent down to the &s;quadron, treach|erou&s;ly made his peace with the enemy. On that very day, the Dutch &s;hips came up, moored under the fort, landed their men, and entered the garri&s;on, without giving or re|ceiving a &s;hot. A council of war was afterwards held at the &s;tadt hou&s;e, at which were pre&s;ent</P>
<P>Cornelius Evert&s;e, jun, Jacob Benkes, commodores. An|thony Colve, Nicholas Bowes, Abraham Ferd. Van Zyll, captains.</P>
<P>All the magi&s;trates and con&s;tables from Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey, Long I&s;land, E&s;opus, and Albany, were immediately &s;ummoned to New York; and the major part of them &s;wore allegiance to the &s;tates general, and the prince of Orange. Col. Love|lace was ordered to depart the province, but afterwards ob|tained leave to return to England with commodore Benkes.
<PB N="42" REF="024800_0038_0FCD62A7D6DA99E8">It has often been in&s;i&s;ted on, that this conque&s;t did not ex|tend to the whole province of New-Jer&s;ey; but upon what foundation, I cannot di&s;cover. From the Dutch records, it appears, that deputies were &s;ent by the people inhabiting the country, even &s;o far we&s;tward as Delaware river, who, in the name of their principals, made a declaration of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; in return for which, certain privileges were granted to them, and three judicatories erected at Niewer Am&s;tel, Upland, and Hoer Kill.

<P>The Dutch governor enjoyed his office but a very &s;hort &s;ea&s;on; for on the 9th of February, 1674, the treaty of peace between England and the &s;tates general was &s;igned at We&s;tmin&s;ter; the &s;ixth article of which, re&s;tored this coun|try to the Engli&s;h. The terms of it were generally, "that what&s;oever countries, i&s;lands, towns, ports, ca&s;tles, or forts, have or &s;hall be taken on both &s;ides, &s;ince the time that the late unhappy war broke out, either in Europe or el&s;ewhere, &s;hall be re&s;tored to the former lord and proprietor, in the &s;ame condition they &s;hall be in, when the peace it&s;elf &s;hall be proclaimed; after which time, there &s;hall be no &s;poil nor plunder of the inhabitants, no demolition of fortifica|tions, nor carrying away of guns, powder or military &s;tores, which belonged to any ca&s;tle or fort, at the time when it was taken."</P>
<P>The lenity, which began the admini&s;tration of col. Ni|colls, was continued under Lovelace. He appears to have been a man, rather of a phlegmatic than an enterpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition, always pur&s;uing the common road, and &s;carcely ever acting without the aid of his council. In&s;tead of taking upon him&s;elf the &s;ole determination of judicial controver|&s;ies, after the example of his predece&s;&s;or, he called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance a few ju&s;tices of the peace. This, which was cal|led the court of a&s;&s;izes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a court both of law and equity, for the trial of cau&s;es of 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards, and ordinarily &s;at but once a year. Subordinate to this, were the town courts and &s;e&s;|&s;ions; the former took cognizance of actions under 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the latter, of &s;uits between that &s;um and twenty pounds: &s;even con&s;tables and over&s;eers were judges in the fir&s;t; and in the la&s;t, the ju&s;tices of the peace, with a jury of &s;even men. The verdict of the majority was &s;ufficient.</NOTE>, was the principal law judicatory in tho&s;e times. The legi&s;lative power under the duke, was ve&s;ted entirely in the governor and council. A third e&s;tate might then be ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;ed with, for the charge of the

Nicolls on the fir&s;t of June 1665, and was thus. The high &s;heriff i&s;&s;ued a warrant annually, to the high con&s;ta|bles of every di&s;trict, and they &s;ent theirs to the petty con|&s;tables; who, with the over&s;eers of each town, made a li&s;t of all male per&s;ons above &s;ixteen years of age, with an e&s;ti|mate of their rent and per&s;onal e&s;tates, and then taxed them according to certain rates, pre&s;cribed by a law. After the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was returned to the high &s;heriff, and approved by the governor, the con&s;tables received warrants for levying the taxes by di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ale.</NOTE>, and in a great mea&s;ure defrayed by his royal highne&s;s, the proprietor of the country.</P>
<P>Upon conclu&s;ion of the peace in 1674, the duke of York, to remove all controver&s;y re&s;pecting his property, obtained a new patent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some are of opinion, that the &s;econd patent was un|nece&s;&s;ary, the duke being reve&s;ted per po&s;t liminium. This matter has been often di&s;puted, in the ejectments between the New-Jer&s;ey proprietors and the Elizabethtown paten|tees. In New York, the right of po&s;t liminy was di&s;regarded, and perhaps unknown: for there are many in&s;tances, e&s;|pecially on Long I&s;land, of new grants from &s;ir Edmond Andro&s;s, for lands patented under Nicolls and Lovelace, by which the quit-rents have been artfully enlarged.</NOTE> from the king, dated the 29th of June, for the lands granted in 1664, and two days after commi&s;&s;ioned major, afterwards &s;ir Edmond Andro&s;s to be governor of his territories in America. After the re&s;ignation of this pro|vince, which was made to him by the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, on the 31&s;t of October following, he called a court martial, to try Manning for his treacherous and cowardly &s;urrender. The articles of accu&s;ation exhibited again&s;t him, were in &s;ub&s;tance,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the &s;aid Manning, on the 28th of July, 1673, hav|ing notice of the approach of the enemy's fleet, did not en|deavour to put the garri&s;on in a po&s;ture of defence; but, on the contrary, &s;lighted &s;uch as offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="2">II. That while the fleet was at anchor under Staten I&s;land, on the 30th of July, he treacherou&s;ly &s;ent on board to treat with the enemy, to the great di&s;couragement of the gar|ri&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">III. That he &s;uffered the fleet to moor under the fort, forbidding a gen to be fired, on pain of death.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="45" REF="024800_0041_0FCD62AD94BF1C88">
IV. That he permitted the enemy to land, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="5">V. That, &s;hortly after he had &s;ent per&s;ons to treat with the Dutch commodores, he &s;truck his flag, even before the enemy were in &s;ight of the garri&s;on, the fort being in a condition, and the men de&s;irous, to fight.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And la&s;tly, that he treacherou&s;ly cau&s;ed the fort gates to be opened, and cowardly and ba&s;ely let in the enemy, yielding the garri&s;on without articles.</P>
<P>This &s;candalous charge, which Manning on his trial con|fe&s;&s;ed to be true, is le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, than the lenity of the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him. It was this, that though he de&s;erved death, yet becau&s;e he had, &s;ince the &s;urrender, been in England, and &s;een the king and the duke, it was adjudge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that his &s;word &s;hould be broke over his head in public, before the city hall, and him&s;elf rendered incapa|ble of wearing a &s;word, and of &s;erving his maje&s;ty for the future, in any public tru&s;t in the government.</P>
<P>This light cen&s;ure is however no proof, that &s;ir Edmond was a man of a merciful di&s;po&s;ition; the hi&s;torians of New-England, where he was afterwards governor, ju&s;tly tran&s;|mit him to po&s;terity, under the odious character of a &s;yco|phantic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l to the duke, and an arbitrary tyrant over the people committed to his care. He knew no law, but the will of his ma&s;ter: and Kirk and Jefferies were not fit|ter in&s;truments than he to execute the de&s;potic projects of James II.</P>
<P>In the year 1675, Nicholas Ren&s;laer, a Dutch clergyman, arrived here. He claimed the manor of Ren&s;laerwick, and was recommended by the duke to &s;ir Edmond Andro&s;s for a living in one of the churches at New-York, or Albany, probably to &s;erve the popi&s;h cau&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned for the favour he met with from the crown. It is &s;aid, that while Charles II. was an exile, he predicted the day of his re&s;toration. The people of Albany had a high opinion of his prophetic &s;pirit, and many &s;trange tales about him &s;till prevail there. The par&s;on made nothing of his claim, the manor being afterwards granted, by col. Dongan, to Killian Van Ren&s;laer, a di&s;tant relation. This exten&s;ive tract, by the Dutch called a colony, is an oblong, extending 24 miles upon Hud&s;on's river, and as many on each &s;ide. The patent of confirmation was i&s;&s;ued by &s;pecial direction from the king, and is the mo&s;t liberal, in the privileges it grants, of any one in the province.</NOTE>. Niewenhyt, mini&s;ter
<PB N="46" REF="024800_0042_0FCD62AE90DE63D0">of the church at Albany, di&s;puted his right to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments; becau&s;e he had received an epi&s;copal or|dination, and was not app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oved by the cla&s;&s;is of Am&s;terdam, to which the Dutch churches here hold them&s;elves &s;ubordi|nate. In this controver&s;y, the governor took the part of Renilaer, and accordingly &s;ummoned Niewenhyt before him, to an&s;wer for his conduct. This mini&s;ter was treated wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;uch &s;ingular contempt, and &s;o frequently harra&s;&s;ed by fruitle&s;s and expen&s;ive attendances before the council, that the di&s;pute became intere&s;ting, and the greater part of the people re&s;ented the u&s;age he met with. Hence we find, that the magi&s;trates of Albany, &s;oon after impri&s;oned Ren|&s;laer, for &s;everal dubious words (as they are called in the record) delivered in a &s;ermon. The governor, on the other hand, ordered him to be relea&s;ed, and &s;ummoned the ma|gi&s;trates to attend him at New York. Warrants were then i&s;&s;ued to compel them to give &s;ecurity in 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> each, to make out good cau&s;e for confining the mini&s;ter. Lei&s;ler, who was one of them, refu&s;ed to comply with the warrant, and was thrown into gaol. Sir Edmond, fearful that a great party would ri&s;e up again&s;t him, was at la&s;t compelled to di&s;continue his eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and to refer the controver&s;y to the determination of the con&s;i&s;tory of the Dutch church at Albany. It is perhaps not improbable, that the&s;e popi&s;h mea&s;ures &s;owed the &s;eeds of that aver&s;ion to the duke's government, which afterwards produced tho&s;e violent convul&s;ions in the province under Lei&s;ler, at the time of the revolution, in favour of the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>If &s;ir Edmond Andro&s;s's admini&s;tration at New-York, appears to be le&s;s exceptionable, than while he commanded at Bo&s;ton, it was through want of more opportunities to &s;how him&s;elf in his true light. The main cour&s;e of his pub|lic proceedings, during his continuance in the province, was &s;pent in the ordinary acts of government, which then principally con&s;i&s;ted in pa&s;&s;ing grants to the &s;ubject, and pre&s;iding in the court of a&s;&s;ize, e&s;tabli&s;hed by col. Lovelace. The public exigencies were now in part &s;upplied by a kind of benevolence; the badge of bad times! This appears in an entry on the records, of a letter of May the 5th, 1676, from governor And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;s, to &s;everal towns on Long I&s;land, de&s;iring to know, what &s;ums they would contribute to|wards the war. Near the clo&s;e of his admini&s;tration, he thought proper to quarrel with Philip Carteret, who in 1680, exerci&s;ed the government of Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey, under a commi&s;&s;ion from &s;ir Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge Carteret, dated the 31&s;t of Ju|ly, 1675. Andro&s;s di&s;puted his right, and &s;eized and brought
<PB N="47" REF="024800_0043_0FCD62B31BFA2F88">him pri&s;oner to New-York; for which it is &s;aid he lo&s;t his own government; but whoever con&s;iders that &s;ir Edmond was immediately preferred to be governor of Bo&s;ton, will rather believe, that the duke &s;uper&s;eded him for &s;ome other rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the &s;ucceeding admini&s;tration, in which our Indian affairs began to have a powerful influence upon the public mea&s;ures, it may not be improper to pre|&s;ent the reader with a &s;ummary view of the hi&s;tory and character of the five nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the Dutch called Maquaas, by the French Iroquois, and by us, five nations, &s;ix nations, and lately the confede|rates. They are greatly dimini&s;hed, and con&s;i&s;t now only of about twelve hundred &s;ighting men.</NOTE>. The&s;e, of all tho&s;e innumer|able tribes of &s;avages, which inhabit the northern part of America, are of mo&s;t importance to us and the French, both on account of their vicinity and warlike di&s;po&s;ition. Before the late incorporation of the Tu&s;caroras, a people driven by the inhabitants of Carolina from the frontiers of Vir|ginia, they con&s;i&s;ted of five confederate cantons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Tu&s;caroras were received upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they were originally of the &s;ame &s;tock with the five nations, becau&s;e there is &s;ome &s;imilitude between their languages.</NOTE>. What in particular gave ri&s;e to this league, and when it took place, are que&s;tions which neither the natives, nor Europeans, pretend to an&s;wer. Each of the&s;e nations is divided into three families, or clans, of different ranks, bearing for their arms, and being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of, the tortoi&s;e, the bear, and the wolf<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Their in&s;truments of conveyances are &s;igned by &s;igna|tures, which they make with a pen, repre&s;enting the&s;e animals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No people in the world, perhaps, have higher notions than the&s;e Indians, of military glory. All the &s;urrounding nations have felt the effects of their prowe&s;s; and many not only became their tributaries, but were &s;o &s;ubjugated to their power, that without their con&s;ent, they dur&s;t not commence either peace or war.</P>
<P>Though a regular police for the pre&s;ervation of har|mony within, and the defence of the &s;tate again&s;t inva&s;ions from without, is not to be expected from the people of whom I am now writing, yet perhaps, they have paid more attention to it than is generally allowed. Their government is &s;uited to their condition. A people who&s;e riches con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="48" REF="024800_0044_0FCD62B4B080A428">not &s;o much in abundance, as in a freedom from want<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">An Indian, in an&s;wer to his que&s;tion, what the white people meant by covetou&s;ne&s;s? was told by another, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignified, a de&s;ire of more than a man had need of.

All their affairs, whether re&s;pecting peace or war, are under the direction of their &s;achems, or chief men. Great exploits and public virtue procure the e&s;teem of a people, and qualify a man to advi&s;e in council, and execute the plan concerted for the advantage of his country: thus whoever appears to the Indians in this advantageous light, commences a &s;achem without any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her ceremony.</P>
<P>As there is no other way of arriving at this dignity, &s;o it cea&s;es, unle&s;s an uniform zeal and activity for the common good, is uninterruptedly continued. Some have thought it hereditary; but that is a mi&s;take. The &s;on is, indeed, re|&s;pected for his father's &s;ervices; but, without per&s;onal me|rit, he can never &s;hare in the government; which, were it otherwi&s;e, mu&s;t &s;ink into perfect di&s;grace. The children of &s;uch as are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rioti&s;m, moved by the con&s;ideration of their birth, and the perpetual incitements to virtue con&s;tantly inculcated into them, imitate their fa|thers' exploits, and thus attain to the &s;ame honours and in|fluence; which accounts for the opinion that the title and power of &s;achem is hereditary.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e republics has its own particular chiefs, who hear and determine all complaints in council; and, though they have no officers for the execution of ju&s;tice, yet their decree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are always obeyed, from the general reproach that would follow a contempt of their advice. The condition of this people exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s them from factions, the common di&s;ea&s;e of popular governments. It is impo&s;&s;ible to gain a party among&s;t them by indirect means; for no man has either honour, riches, or power to be&s;tow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned and judicious author of the &s;pirit of laws, &s;peaking of a people who have a fixed property in lands, ob&s;erves, "that if a chief would deprive them of their li|berty, they would immediately go and &s;eek it under ano|ther, or retire into the woods, and live there with their families." The five nations can never be en&s;laved, till they grow rich by agriculture and commerce. Property is the mo&s;t permanent ba&s;is of power. The authority of a &s;achem depending only upon his reputation for wi&s;dom and cou|rage, mu&s;t be weak and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rious, and therefore &s;afe to the people.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="024800_0045_0FCD62B7EF3D8568">
All affairs, which concern the general intere&s;t, are deter|mined in a great a&s;&s;embly of the chiefs of each canton, u&s;ually held at Onondaga, the centre of their country. Up|on emergencies, they act &s;eparately; but nothing can bind the league, but the voice of the general convention.</P>
<P>The French, upon the maxim, <HI>divide et impera,</HI> have tried all po&s;&s;ible means to divide the&s;e republics, and &s;ome|times have even &s;own great jealou&s;ies among them. In con|&s;equence of this plan, they have &s;educed many families to withdraw to Canada, and there &s;ettled them in regular towns, under the command of a fort, and the tuition of mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>The manners of the&s;e &s;avages are as &s;imple as their go|vernment. Their hou&s;es are a few crotched &s;takes thru&s;t into the ground, and overlaid with bark. A fire is kindled in the middle, and an aperture left at the top for the con|veyance of the &s;moke. Whenever a con&s;iderable number of tho&s;e huts are collected, they have a ca&s;tle, as it is cal|led, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;quare without ba&s;tions, &s;urrounded with palli&s;adoes. They have no other fortification: and this is only de&s;igned as an a&s;ylum for their old men, their wives, and children, while the re&s;t are gone out to war. They live almo&s;t entirely without care. While the women, or &s;quaws, cultivate a little &s;pot of ground for corn, the men employ them&s;elves in hunting. As to clothes, they u&s;e a blanket girt at the wai&s;t, and thrown loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders; &s;om of their women, indeed. have be&s;ides this, a &s;ort of a petticoat, and a few of their men wear &s;hirts; but the greater part of them are generally half naked. In winter, their legs are covered with &s;tockings of blanket, and their feet with &s;ocks of deer &s;kin. Many of them are fond to or|naments, and their ta&s;te is very &s;ingular. I have &s;een rings affixed, not only to their ears, but their no&s;es. Bracelets of &s;ilver and bra&s;s round their wri&s;ts, are very common. The women plait their hair, and tie it up behind in a bag, per|haps in imitation of the French beaux in Canada. Though the Indians are capable of &s;u&s;taining great hard&s;hips, yet they cannot endure much labour, being rather fleet, than &s;trong. Their men are taller than the Europeans, rarely

In their food, they have no manner of delivery; for though veni&s;on is their ordinary diet, yet &s;ometimes they eat dogs, bears, and even &s;nakes. Their cookery is of two kinds, boiled or roa&s;ted; to perform the latter, the meat is penetrated by a &s;hort &s;harp &s;tick &s;et in the ground, inclining towards the fire, and turned as occa&s;ion requires. They are ho&s;pitable to &s;tran|gers; though few Europeans would reli&s;h their highe&s;t fa|vours of this kind; for they are very na&s;ty both in their governments and food. Every man has his own wi&s;e, whom he takes and leaves at plea&s;ure: a plurality, however, at the &s;ome time, is by no means admitted among them. They have been generally commended for their cha&s;tity; but I am informed by good authority. that they are very la&s;|civious, and that the women, to avoid reproach, frequently de&s;troy the foetus in the womb. They are &s;o perfectly free, that unle&s;s their children, who generally a&s;&s;i&s;t the mother, may be called &s;ervants, they have none. The men frequent|ly a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves for conver&s;ation, by which means they not only pre&s;erve the remembrance of their wars, and treaties, but diffu&s;e among their youths, incitements to military glory, as well as in&s;truction in all the &s;ubtilties of war.</P>
<P>Since they became acquainted with the Europeans, their warlike apparatus is a mu&s;ket, hatcher<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Hence, to take up the hatcher, is with them a phra&s;e &s;ignifying to declare war; as, on the contrary, to bury it denotes the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a peace.</NOTE>, and a long knife. Their boys &s;till accu&s;tom them&s;elves to bows and arrows, and are &s;o dextrous in the u&s;e of them, that a lad of &s;ix|teen, will &s;trike an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Engli&s;h &s;hilling five times in ten, at twelve or fourteen yards di&s;tance. Their men are excellent mark&s;men, both with the gun and hatcher; their dexterity at the latter is very extraordinary; for they rarely mi&s;s the object, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The hatcher in the flight perpetually turns round, and yet always &s;trikes the mark with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge.</P>
<P>Before they go out, they have a fea&s;t upon dogs' fle&s;h, and a great war dance. At the&s;e, the warriors, who are frightfully painted with vermillion, ri&s;e up, and &s;ing their
<PB N="51" REF="024800_0047_0FCD62BB24BA4478">own exploits, or tho&s;e of their ance&s;tors, and thereby kin|dle a military enthu&s;ia&s;m in the whole company. The day after the dance, they march out a few miles in a row, ob|&s;erving a profound &s;ilence. The proce&s;&s;ion being ended, they &s;trip the bark from a large oak, and paint the de&s;ign of their expedition on the naked trunk. The figure of a canoe, with the number of men in it, determines the &s;trength of their party; and by a deer, a fox, or &s;ome other emblem painted at the head of it, we di&s;cover again&s;t what nation they are gone out.</P>
<P>The five nations being devoted to war, every art is con|trived to diffu&s;e a military &s;pirit through the whole body of their people. The ceremonies attending the return of a party, &s;eem calculated in particular for that purpo&s;e. The day before they enter the village, two heralds advance, and, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, &s;et up a yell, which, by its modula|tion, intimates either good or bad news. If the former, the village is alarmed, and an entertainment provided for the conquerors, who, in the mean time, approach in &s;ight: one of them bears the &s;calps &s;tretched over a bow, and elevated upon a long pole. The bolde&s;t man in the town comes out, and receives it, and in&s;tantly flies to the hut where the re&s;t are collected. If he is overtaken, he is beaten unmercifully: but if he out-runs the pur&s;uer, he participates in the ho|nour of the victors, who, at their fir&s;t entrance, receive no compliments, nor &s;peak a &s;ingle word till the end of the fea&s;t. Their parents, wives, and children, then are admit|ted, and treat them with the profounde&s;t re&s;pect. After the&s;e &s;alutations, one of the conquerors is appointed to re|late the whole adventure, to which the re&s;t attentively li&s;|ten, without a&s;king a que&s;tion, and the whole concludes with a &s;avage dance.</P>
<P>The Indians never fight in the field, or upon equal terms; but always &s;culk and attack, by &s;urpri&s;e, in &s;mall parties, meeting every night at a place of rendezvous.

<P>The art of public &s;peaking is in high e&s;teem among the Indians, and much &s;tudied.

With re&s;pect to religion, the Indians may be &s;aid to be under the thicke&s;t gloom of ignorance. If they have any, which is much to be que&s;tioned, tho&s;e who affirm it, will find it difficult to tell us wherein it con&s;i&s;ts. They have nei|ther prie&s;t, nor temple, &s;acrifice nor altar. Some traces, in|deed, appear, of the original law written upon their hearts; but they have no &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, nor any rites and modes of public wor&s;hip. They are &s;unk, un&s;peakably be|neath the polite pagans of antiquity. Some confu&s;ed no|tions, indeed, of beings &s;uperior to them&s;elves, they have, but of the Deity and his natural and moral perfections, no proper or tolerable conceptions; and of his general and particular providence they know nothing. They profe&s;s no obligations to him, nor acknowledge their dependence up|on him. Some of them, it is &s;aid, are of opinion, that there are two di&s;tinct, powerful beings, one able to help, the other to do them harm. The latter they venerate mo&s;t, and &s;ome allege that they addre&s;s him by a kind of prayer. Though there are no public monuments of idolatry to be &s;een in their country, yet the mi&s;&s;ionaries have di&s;covered coar&s;e imagery in wooden trinkets, in the hands of their jugglers, which the converts deliver up as dete&s;table. The &s;ight of them, would remind a man of letters, of the lares and penates of the ancients; but no certain judgment can be drawn of their u&s;e. The Indians &s;ometimes a&s;&s;emble in large numbers, and retire far into the wilderne&s;s, where they eat and drink in a profu&s;e manner. The&s;e conventions are called Kenticoys. Some e&s;teem them to be debauched revels or Bacchanalia: but tho&s;e who have privately fol|lowed them into the&s;e rece&s;&s;es, give &s;uch accounts of their conduct, as naturally lead one to imagine, that they pay a Joint homage and &s;upplication to &s;ome invi&s;ible being. If we &s;uppo&s;e they have a religion, it is wor&s;e than none, and rai&s;es in the generous mind, mo&s;t melancholy ideas of their depraved condition. Little has been done to illuminate the&s;e dark corners of the earth, with the light of the go&s;|pel. The French prie&s;ts boa&s;t, indeed, of their converts, but they have made more pro&s;elytes to polities than reli|gion. Queen Anne &s;ent a mi&s;&s;ionary among them, and gave him an appointment out of the privy pur&s;e. He was a man

Barclay afterwards re&s;ided among the Mohawks; but no &s;uitable provi&s;ion being made for an interpreter, he was obliged to break up the mi&s;&s;ion. If the Engli&s;h &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, that tru|ly venerable body, in&s;tead of maintaining mi&s;&s;ionaries in rich chri&s;tian congregations along the continent, expended half the amount of their annual contributions on the evan|geli&s;ts among the heathen, be&s;ides the un&s;peakable reli|gious benefits that would, it is to be hoped, accrue to the natives, &s;uch a proceeding would conduce greatly to the &s;afety of our colonies, and his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. Much has been written upon this &s;ubject in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See mr. Hobart's letters to the epi&s;copalians in New-England: the account of the Scotch mi&s;&s;ion at Stockbridge: Dougla&s;s's &s;ummary, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and why no|thing to purpo&s;e has yet been attempted in England, to|wards &s;o laudable a de&s;ign, can only be attributed to the amazing fal&s;ehoods and mi&s;repre&s;entations, by which &s;ome of the mi&s;&s;ionaries have long impo&s;ed upon benevolent: minds in Great Britain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is notorious to all who give them&s;elves the trou|ble of peru&s;ing the ab&s;tracts of their accounts publi&s;hed in England. It would be 2 very agreeable office to me, on this occa&s;ion, to di&s;tingui&s;h the innocent from the guilty, but that &s;uch a ta&s;k would infallibly rai&s;e up a ho&s;t of enemies. Many of the mi&s;&s;ionaries are men of learning and exem|plary morals. The&s;e in America are known and honoured, and cannot be prejudiced by an indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure. Their joining in a repre&s;entation for di&s;tingui&s;hing the de|linquents, who are a di&s;grace to the cloth, will &s;erve as a full vindication of them&s;elves to the &s;ociety. Mr. Ogilvie is, I believe, the only per&s;on now employed by that charitable corporation among the Indians, and the greate&s;t part even of his charge is in the city of Albany. All the Scotch mi&s;|&s;ionaries are among the heathen, and their &s;ucce&s;s has been &s;ufficient to encourage any future attempts. There is a re|gular &s;ociety of Indian converts in New Jer&s;ey; and it is worthy of remark, that not one of them has apo&s;tatized into heatheni&s;m. Some of them have made &s;uch proficien|cies in practical religion, as ought to &s;hame many of us, who boa&s;t the illuminating aids of our native chri&s;tianity. Not one of the&s;e Indians has been concerned in tho&s;e bar|barous irruptions, which have lately deluged the frontiers of the &s;outh-we&s;tern provinces, with the blood of &s;everal hundred innocents of every age and &s;ex. At the com|mencement of the&s;e ravages, they flew into the &s;ettlements, and put them&s;elves under the protection of the govern|ment. The&s;e Indians no &s;ooner became chri&s;tians, than they openly profe&s;&s;ed their loyalty to king George; and there|fore to contribute to their conver&s;ion, was as truly politic, as nobly chri&s;tian. Tho&s;e colonies which have done mo&s;t for this charitable de&s;ign, have e&s;caped be&s;t from the late di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamities. Of all the mi&s;&s;ionaries, mr. David Brainerd, who recovered the&s;e Indians from the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, was mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. He died the 9th of Octo|ber 1747, a victim to his extreme mortification and inextin|gui&s;hable zeal, for the pro&s;perity of his mi&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who are curious to enquire particularly into the effects of his indefatigable indu&s;try, may have recour&s;e to his journal, publi&s;hed at Philadelphia, by the American corre&s;pondents of the Scotch &s;ociety, in who&s;e &s;ervice he was employed.

As to the hi&s;tory of the five nations, before their acquain|tance with the Europeans, it is wrapt up in the darkne&s;s of antiquity. It is &s;aid that their fir&s;t re&s;idence was in the country about Montreal; and that the &s;uperior &s;trength of the Adirondacs, whom the French call Algonquins, drove them into their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, lying on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Mohawks river, and the great lake Ontario<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, in partiality to the French, limits the coun|try of the five nations, on the north, to the 44th degree of latitude; according to which, all the country on the north &s;ide of the lake Ontario, and the river i&s;&s;uing thence to Montreal, together with a con&s;iderable tract of land on the &s;outh &s;ide of that river, belongs to the French. Hennepin, a recollect friar, has more regard to truth than the je&s;uit; for he tells us in effect, that the Iroquois po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lands on the north, as well as the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake, and men|tions &s;everal of their villages in 1679, viz.

<PB N="57" REF="024800_0053_0FCD62C79AF8BD48">great &s;eries of years, the confederates gained advantages over the Adirondacs, and &s;truck a general terror into all the other Indians. The Hurons on the north &s;ide of the lake Erie, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Indians on the &s;outh &s;ide, were totally conquered and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;per&s;ed. The French who &s;ettled Canada in 1603, took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">brage at their &s;ucce&s;s, and began a war with them, which had well nigh ruined the new colony. In autumn 1665, m. Courcelles, the governor, &s;ent, out a party again&s;t the Mohawks. Through ignorance of the country, and the want of &s;now-&s;hoes, they were almo&s;t pe|ri&s;hed, when they fell in with Schenectady. And even there the Indians would have &s;acrificed them to their barbarous rage, had not Corlear, a Dutchman, interpo&s;ed to protect them. For this &s;ea&s;onable ho&s;pitality, the French governor invited him to Canada, but he was unfortunately drowned in his pa&s;&s;age through the lake Champlain. It is in honour of this man, who was a favourite of the Indians, that the governors of New York, in all their treaties, are addre&s;&s;ed by the name of Corlear. Twenty light companies of foot, and the whole militia of Canada, marched the next &s;pring into the country of the Mohawks: but their &s;ucce&s;s was va&s;tly unequal to the charge and labour of &s;uch a tedious march of 700 miles through an uncultivated de&s;art; for the Indians, on their approach, retired into the woods, leaving behind them &s;ome old &s;achems, who preferred death to life, to glut the fury of their enemies. The emptine&s;s of this parade on the one hand, and the Indian fearfulne&s;s of fire arms on the other, brought about a peace in 1667, which continued for &s;everal years after. In this interval, both the Engli&s;h and French cultivated a trade with the natives, very profitable to both nations. The latter, however, were mo&s;t politic and vigorous, and filled the Indian country with their mi&s;&s;ionaries. The &s;ieur Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, the very year in which the peace was concluded, travelled about 1200 miles we&s;t-ward, making pro&s;elytes of the Indians every where to the French intere&s;t. Courcelles appears to have been a man of art and indu&s;try. He took every mea&s;ure in his power for the defence of Canada. To prevent the irruptions of the five nations, by the way of lake Champlain, he built &s;eve|ral forts in 1665, between that and the mouth of the river Sorel.

This village was begun in 1671, and con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch of the five nations, as have formerly been drawn away by the intrigues of the French prie&s;ts, in the times of Lovelace and Andro&s;s, who &s;eem to have paid no attention to our Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of late, &s;ome others of the confederates have been al|lured to &s;ettle at O&s;wegatchi, called by the French, la Gal|lette, near 50 miles below Frontenac. General Shirley's emi&s;&s;aries from O&s;wego, in 1755, prevailed with &s;everal of the&s;e families to return to their old habitations.</NOTE>. It was owing to the in&s;tigation al&s;o of the&s;e prie&s;ts, that the five nations about this time, committed ho&s;tilities on the back parts of Maryland and Virginia, which occa&s;ioned a grand conven|tion at Albany, in the year 1684. Lord Howard of Effing|ham, the governor of Virginia, was pre&s;ent, and made a covenant with them for preventing further depredations, towards the accompli&s;hment of which, col. Dongan was ve|ry

<P>While lord Howard was at Albany, a me&s;&s;enger from de la Barre, then governor of Canada, arrived there, complain|ing of the Seneca Indians, for interrupting the French in their trade with the more di&s;tant Indians, commonly in|cluded among us by the general name of the far nations<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">By the far nations are meant, all tho&s;e numerous tribes inhabiting the countries on both &s;ides of the lakes Huron and Erie, we&s;tward as far as the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and the &s;outh|ern country along the banks of the Ohio, and its branches.</NOTE>. Colonel Dongan, to whom the me&s;&s;age was &s;ent, communi|cated it to the Senecas, who admitted the charge, but ju&s;ti|fied their conduct, alleging, that the French &s;upplied arms and ammunition to the Twightwies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the French called Miamies.</NOTE>, with whom they were then at war. De la Barre, at the &s;ame time, medita|ting nothing le&s;s than the total de&s;truction of the five na|tions, proceeded with an army of 1700 men to the lake Ontario. Mighty preparations were made to obtain the de|&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s: fre&s;h troops were imported from France, and a letter procured from the duke of York to col. Dongan, commanding him to lay no ob&s;tacles in the way. The offi|cers po&s;ted in the out forts, even as far as Me&s;&s;i&s;imakinac, were ordered to rendezvous at Niagara, with all the we&s;|tern Indians they could engage. Dongan, regardle&s;s of the duke's orders, appri&s;ed the Indians of the French de&s;igns, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. After &s;ix weeks delay at fort Frontenac, during which time a great &s;ickne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by bad provi&s;ions, broke out in the French army, de la Barre found it nece&s;&s;ary to conclude the campaign with a treaty, for which purpo&s;e he cro&s;&s;ed the lake, and came to the place, which, from the di&s;tre&s;s of his army, was called la Famine. Dongan &s;ent an interpreter among the Indians, by all means to prevent them from attending the treaty. The Mohawks and Senecas accordingly refu&s;ed to meet de la Barre: but the Oneydoes, Onondagas, and Cayugas, influenced by the mi&s;&s;ionaries, were unwilling to hear the interpreter, except before the prie&s;ts, one la Main, and three other Frenchmen, and afterwards waited upon the

<P>"The king, my ma&s;ter, being informed, that the five na|tions have often infringed the peace, has ordered me to come hither with a guard, and to &s;end Ohgue&s;&s;e to the Onondagas, to bring the chief &s;achems to my camp. The intention of the great king is, that you and I may &s;moke the calumet of peace together; but on this condition, that you promi&s;e me, in the name of the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Mohawks, to give entire &s;atisfaction and reparation to his &s;ubjects, and for the future, never to mo|le&s;t them.</P>
<P>"The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, have robbed and abu&s;ed all the traders that were pa&s;&s;ing to the Illinois and Miamies, and other Indian nati|ons, the children of my king. They have acted, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, contrary to the treaty of peace with my prede|ce&s;&s;or. I am ordered, therefore, to demand &s;atisfaction, and to tell them, that in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, or their plundering us any more, I have expre&s;s orders to declare war. This belt confirms my words. The warriors of the five nations have conducted the Engli&s;h into the lakes, which belong to the king, my ma&s;ter, and brought the Engli&s;h among the nati|ons that are his children, to de&s;troy the trade of his &s;ub|jects, and to withdraw the&s;e nations from him. They have carried the Engli&s;h thither, notwith&s;tanding the prohibi|tion of the late governor of New York, who fore&s;aw the ri&s;que that both they and you would run. I am willing to forget tho&s;e things, but if ever the like &s;hall happen for the future, I have expre&s;s orders to declare war again&s;t you. This belt confirms my words. Your warriors have made &s;e|veral barbarous incur&s;ions on the Illinois and Umameis; they have ma&s;&s;acred men, women, and children, and have made many of the&s;e nations pri&s;oners, who thought them|&s;elves &s;afe in their villages in time of peace: the&s;e people, who are my king's children, mu&s;t not be your &s;laves; you mu&s;t give them their liberty, and &s;end them back into their own country. If the five nations &s;hall refu&s;e to do this, I have expre&s;s orders to declare war again&s;t them. This belt confirms my words.</P>
<P>"This is what I have to &s;ay to Garrangula, that he may carry to the Senecas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, Cayugas, and Mohawks, the declaration which the king, my ma&s;ter, has
<PB N="62" REF="024800_0058_0FCD62D1CDDDD9B8">commanded me to make. He doth not wi&s;h them to force him to fend a great army to Cadarackui fort, to begin a war, which mu&s;t be fatal to them. He would be &s;orry that this fort, that was the work of peace, &s;hould become the pri&s;on of your warriors. We mu&s;t endeavour, on both &s;ides, to prevent &s;uch misfortunes. The French, who are the brethren and friends of the five nations, will never trouble their repo&s;e, provided that the &s;atisfaction which I demand, be given, and that the treaties of peace be here|after ob&s;erved. I &s;hall be extremely grieved, if my words do not produce the effect, which I expect from them; for then I &s;hall be obliged to join with the governor of New-York, who is commanded by his ma&s;ter, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and burn the ca&s;tles of the five nations, and de&s;troy you.

<OPENER><SALUTE>YONNONDIO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I honour you, and the warriors that are with me like|wi&s;e honour you. Your interpreter has fini&s;hed your &s;peech; I now begin mine. My words make ha&s;te to reach your ears; hearken to them.</P>
<P>Yonnondio, you mu&s;t have believed, when you left Quebec, that the &s;un had burnt up all the fore&s;ts, which render our country inacce&s;&s;ible to the French, or that the lakes had &s;o far overflown the banks, that they had &s;urround|ed our ca&s;tles, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to get out of them. Yes, Yonnondio, &s;urely you mu&s;t have dreamt &s;o; and the curio&s;ity of &s;eeing &s;o great a wonder, has brought you &s;o far. Now you are undeceived, &s;ince that I and the warriors here pre&s;ent, are come to a&s;&s;ure you, that the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, are yet alive. I thank you, in their name, for bringing back into their country the calumet, which your predece&s;&s;or re|ceived from their hands. It was happy for you, that you left under ground that murdering hatchet, that has been &s;o often died in the blood of the French. Hear, Yonnondio, I do not &s;leep; I have my eyes open; and the &s;un, which enlightens me, di&s;covers to me a great captain at the head of a company of &s;oldiers, who &s;peaks as if he were dream|ing. He &s;ays, that he only came to the lake to &s;moke on the great calumet with the Onondagas. But Garrangula
<PB N="63" REF="024800_0059_0FCD62D5EDCA59E0">&s;ays, that he &s;ees the contrary, that it was to knock them on the head, if &s;ickne&s;s had not weakened the arms of the French.</P>
<P>I &s;ee Yonnondio raving in a camp of &s;ick men, who&s;e lives the great &s;pirit has &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, by inflicting this &s;ickne&s;s on them. Hear, Yonnondio, our women had taken their clubs, our children and old men had carried their bows and ar|rows into the heart of your camp, if our warriors had not di&s;armed them, and kept them back, when your me&s;&s;enger, Ohgue&s;&s;e, came to our ca&s;tles. It is done, and I have &s;aid it. Hear, Yonnondio, we plundered none of the French, but tho&s;e that carried guns, powder, and ball to the Twight|wies and Chictaghics, becau&s;e tho&s;e arms might have co&s;t us our lives. Herein we follow the example of the je&s;uits, who &s;tave all the kegs of rum brought to our ca&s;tles, le&s;t the drunken Indians &s;hould knock them on the head. Our war|riors have not bever enough to pay for all the&s;e arms, that they have taken, and our old men are not afraid of the war. This belt pre&s;erves my words.</P>
<P>We carried the Engli&s;h into our lakes, to trade there with the Utawawas and Quatoghies, as the Adirondacks brought the French to our ca&s;tles, to carry on a trade, which the Engli&s;h &s;ay is theirs. We are born free; we neither de|pend on Yonnondio or Corlear.</P>
<P>We may go where we plea&s;e, and carry with us whom we plea&s;e, and buy and &s;ell what we plea&s;e: if your allies be your &s;laves, u&s;e them as &s;uch; command them to receive no other but your people. This belt pre&s;erves my words.</P>
<P>We knocked the Twightwies and Chictaghics on the head, becau&s;e they had cut down the trees of peace, which were the limits of our country. They have hunted bevers on our lands: they have acted contrary to the cu&s;toms of all Indians; for they left none of the bevers alive, they kil|led both male and female. They brought the Satanas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the French called Sauounons.</NOTE> into the country, to take part with them, after they had con|certed ill de&s;igns again&s;t us. We have done le&s;s than either the Engli&s;h or French, that have u&s;urped the lands of &s;o many Indian nations, and cha&s;ed them from their own coun|try. This belt pre&s;erves my words.</P>
<P>Hear, Yonnondio; what I &s;ay, is the voice of all the five nations; hear what they an&s;wer; open your ears to what they &s;peak. The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks &s;ay, that when they buried the

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Yonnondio, take care for the future, that &s;o great a number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as appear there do not choke the tree of peace planted in &s;o &s;mall a fort.

I a&s;&s;ure you, in the name of the five na|tions, that our warriors &s;hall dance to the calumet of peace under its leaves, and &s;hall remain quiet on their mats, and &s;hall never dig up the hatchet, till their brother Yonnondio or Corlear &s;hall either jointly or &s;eparately endeavour to attack the country, which the great &s;pirit has given to our ance&s;tors.

<P>Then Garrangula, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to mon&s;ieur la Main, &s;aid, "Take courage, Ohgue&s;&s;e, you have &s;pirit, &s;peak, explain my words, forget nothing, tell all that your brethren and friends &s;ay to Yonnondio, your governor, by the mouth of Garrangula, who loves you, and de&s;ires you to accept of this pre&s;ent of bever, and take part with me in my fea&s;t, to which I invite you. This pre&s;ent of bever is &s;ent to Yonnondio, on the part of the five nations."</P>
<P>Enraged at this bold reply, de la Barre, as &s;oon as the peace was concluded, retired to Montreal, and ingloriou&s;ly fini&s;hed an expen&s;ive campaign, as dr. Colden ob&s;erves, in a &s;cold with an old Indian.</P>
<P>De la Barre was &s;ucceeded by the marquis de Nonville, colonel of the dragoons, who arrived with a reinforcement of troops in 1685. The marquis was a man of courage and an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and not a little animated by the con|&s;ideration, that he was &s;ent over to repair the di&s;grace, which his predece&s;&s;or had brought upon the French colony. The year after his arrival at Quebec, he wrote a letter to the mini&s;ter in France, recommending the &s;cheme of erect|ing a &s;tone fort, &s;ufficient to contain four or five hundred men, at Niagara, not only to exclude the Engli&s;h from the lakes, but to command the fur trade and &s;ubdue the five na|tions. Dongan, who was jealous of his de&s;igns, took um|brage at the extraordinary &s;upplies &s;ent to fort Frontenac, and wrote to the French governors, &s;ignifying, that if he at|tacked the confederates, he would con&s;ider it, as a breach
<PB N="65" REF="024800_0061_0FCD62D88D8AEF28">of the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns; and to prevent his building a fort at Niagara, he prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and claimed the country as dependent upon the province. De Nonville, in his an&s;wer, denied that he intended to in|vade the Five Nations, tho' the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for that purpo&s;e were then carrying on; and yet Charlevoix commends him for his piety and uprightne&s;s, "<HI>egalement e&s;timable</HI> (&s;ays the je&s;uit) <HI>pour &s;a valour, &s;a droiture, &amp; &s;o piet&eacute;.</HI>" Colonel Dongan, who knew the importance of our Indian alliance, placed no confidence in the declarations of the marquis, but exerted him&s;elf in preparing the confede|rates for a war; and the French author, ju&s;t mentioned, does him honour, while he complains of him as a perpetual ob&s;tacle, in the way of the execution of their &s;chemes. Our allies were now triumphing in their &s;ucce&s;s over the Chic|taghics, and meditating a war with the Twightwies, who had di&s;turbed them in their bever-hunting. De Nonville, to pre|vent the interruption of the French trade with the Twight|wies, determined to divert the Five Nations, and carry the war into their country. To that end, in 1687, he collected 2000 troops and 600 Indians at Montreal, and i&s;&s;ued orders to all the officers in the more we&s;terly country, to meet him with additional &s;uccours at Niagara, on an expedition again&s;t the Senecas. An Engli&s;h party, under one M'Gregory, at the &s;ame time was gone out to trade on the lakes, but the French, notwith&s;tanding the peace then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns, intercepted them, &s;eized their effects, and impri&s;oned their per&s;ons. Mon&s;ieur Fonti, commandant a|mong the Chictaghics, who was coming to the general's ren|dezvous at Niagara, did the like to another Engli&s;h party, which he met with in lake Erie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both the&s;e attacks were open infractions of the treaty at Whitehall, executed in Nov. 1686; by which it was a|greed, that the Indian trade in America, &s;hould be free to the Engli&s;h and French.</NOTE> The Five Nations, in the mean time, were preparing to give the French army a &s;uitable reception. Mon&s;ieur Companie, with two or three hundred Canadians, in an advanced party, &s;urpri&s;ed two villages of the confederates, who, at the invitation and on the faith of the French, &s;eated them&s;elves down about eight leagues from lake Fadarackui, or Ontario. To prevent their e&s;cape with intelligence to their countrymen, they were carried to the fort, and all but thirteen died in torments at the &s;take, &s;ing|ing with an heroic &s;pirit, in their expiring moments, the perfidy of the French. The re&s;t, according to the expre&s;s
<PB N="66" REF="024800_0062_0FCD62DA292CBDB0">orders of the French king, were &s;ent to the galleys in Eu|rope. The marquis, having embarked his whole army in canoes, &s;et out from the fort at Cadarackui, on the 23d of June, one half of them pa&s;&s;ing along the north and the other on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake; and both arrived the &s;ame day at Tyrondequait, and &s;hortly after &s;et out on their march towards the chief village of the Senecas, at about &s;even leagues di&s;tance. The main body was compo&s;ed of the regulars and militia, the front and rear of the Indians and traders. The &s;couts advanced the &s;econd day of their march, as far as the corn of the village, and within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of too Senecas, who lay upon their bellies undi&s;covered. The French, who imagined the enemy were all fled, quickened their march to overtake the women and old men. But no &s;ooner had they reached the foot of a hill, about a mile from the village, than the Senecas rai&s;ed the war &s;hout, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant charged upon the whole army both in the front and rear. Univer&s;al confu&s;ion en&s;ued. The battalions divided, fired upon each other, and flew into the wood. The Senecas improved the di&s;order of the enemy, till they were repul&s;ed by the French Indians. According to Charlevoix's account, which may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, the enemy lo&s;t but &s;ix men, and had twenty wounded in the conflict. Of the Senecas, he &s;ays, &s;ixty were wounded and forty five &s;lain. The marquis was &s;o much di&s;pirited, that he could not be per&s;uaded to pur&s;ue the enemy that day; which gave the Senecas an opportunity to burn their village, and get off. Two old men remained in the ca&s;tle to receive the general, and regale the barbarity of his Indian allies. After de&s;troying the corn in this and &s;everal other villages, the army retired to the banks of the lake, and erected a fort with four ba&s;|tions, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treights at Niagara, in which they left 100 men, under the command of Le Cheva|lier de la Troye, with eight months provi&s;ions; but the&s;e being clo&s;ely blocked up, all, except &s;even or eight of them, who were accidentally relieved, peri&s;hed thro' famine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more perfidious and unju&s;t, than this attack upon our confederates. The two crowns had but ju&s;t concluded a treaty for the pre&s;ervation of the peace: La Hontan, one of the French hi&s;torians, cen&s;ures De Nonville's conduct, and admits the Briti&s;h title to the command of the lakes, but Charlevoix blames him, as he does Hennepin, De L'I&s;le and every other author, who confe&s;&s;es the truth, to the prejudice of the ambitious claims of the court of Frauce.</NOTE> Soon after this expedition, colonel Dongan met the Five Nations

<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am very glad to &s;ee you here in this hou&s;e, and am heartily glad that you have &s;u&s;tained no greater lo&s;s by the French, though I believe it was their intention to de|&s;troy you all, if they could have &s;urpri&s;ed you in your ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard their de&s;ign to war with you, I gave you notice, and came up hither my&s;elf, that I might be ready to give all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice, that &s;o &s;hort a time would allow me.</P>
<P>I am now about &s;ending a gentleman to England, to the king, my ma&s;ter, to let him know, that the French have invaded his territories on this &s;ide of the great lake, and warred upon the brethren his &s;ubjects. I therefore would willingly know, whether the brethren have given the governor of Canada any provocation or not; and if they have, how, and in what manner; becau&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> obliged to give a true account of this matter. This bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cau&s;e a war between the king of England and the French king, both in Europe and here, and therefore I mu&s;t know the truth.</P>
<P>I know the governor of Canada dare not enter into the king of England's territories, in a ho&s;tile manner, without provocation, if he thought the brethren were the king of England's &s;ubjects; but you have, two or three years ago, made a covenant-chain with the French, con|trary to my command (which I knew could not hold long) being void of it&s;elf among the chri&s;tians; fora&s;much as &s;ubjects (as you are) ought not to treat with any foreign nation, it not lying in your power. You have brought this trouble upon your&s;elves; and, as I believe, this is the only rea&s;on of their falling on you at this time.</P>
<P>Brethren, I took it very ill, that after you had put your&s;elves into the number of the great king of England's &s;ubjects, you &s;hould ever offer to make peace or war, without my con&s;ent. You know that we can live without you; but you cannot live without us; you never found that I told you a lie, and I offered you the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you wanted, provided that you would be advi&s;ed by me; for I know the French better than any of you do.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince there is a war begun upon you by the gover|nor of Canada; I hope without any provocation by you
<PB N="68" REF="024800_0064_0FCD62E14789DEE0">given, I de&s;ire and command you, that you hearken to no treaty but by my advice; which if you follow, you &s;hall have the benefit of the great chain of friend&s;hip between the great king of England and the king of France, which came out of England the other day, and which I have &s;ent to Canada by Anthony le Junard; in the mean time, I will give you &s;uch advice as will be for your good; and will &s;upply you with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as you will have need of.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, My advice is, as to what pri&s;oners of the French you &s;hall take, that you draw not their blood, but bring them home, and keep them to exchange for your people, which they have pri&s;oners already, or may take hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That if it be po&s;&s;ible, that you can order it &s;o, I would have you take one or two of your wi&s;e&s;t &s;achems, and one or two of your chief captains, of each nation, to be a council to manage all affairs of the war. They, to give or|ders to the re&s;t of the officers what they are to do, that your de&s;igns may be kept private; for after it comes among &s;o many people, it is blazed abroad, and your de&s;igns are often fru&s;trated; and tho&s;e chief men &s;hould keep a corre&s;pon|dence with me by a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The great matter under con&s;ideration with the brethren is, how to &s;trengthen them&s;elves, and weaken their enemy. My opinion is, that the brethren &s;hould &s;end me&s;&s;en|gers to the Utawawas, Twightwies, and the farther Indians, and to &s;end back likewi&s;e &s;ome of the pri&s;oners of the&s;e na|tions, if you have any left, to bury the hatchet, and to make a covenant-chain, that they may put away all the French that are among them, and that you will open a path for them this way (they being the king of England's &s;ubjects likewi&s;e, though the French have been admitted to trade with them; for all that the French have in Canada, they had it of the great king of England) that, by that means, they may come hither freely, where they may have every thing cheaper than among the French: that you and they may join together again&s;t the French, and make &s;o firm a league, that whoever is an enemy to one, mu&s;t be to both.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Another thing of concern is, that you ought to do what you can, to open a path for all the north Indians and Mahikanders that are among the Utawawas and further nations. I will endeavour to do the &s;ame to bring them home. For, they not daring to return home your way, the French keep them there on purpo&s;e to join with the other nations again&s;t you, for your de&s;truction; for you know, that one of them is wor&s;e than &s;ix of the others; therefore all means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to bring them home, and u&s;e them kindly as they pa&s;s through your country.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="69" REF="024800_0065_0FCD62E278C38268">
5thly, My advice further is, that me&s;&s;engers go, in be|half of all the Five Nations, to the chri&s;tian Indians at Ca|nada, to per&s;uade them to come home to their native coun|try. This will be another great means to weaken your ene|my; but if they will not be advi&s;ed, you know what to do with them.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, I think it very nece&s;&s;ary, for the brethren's &s;ecu|rity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to the endamaging the French, to build a fort upon the lake, where I may keep &s;tores and pro|vi&s;ions, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; and therefore I would have the brethren let me know what place will be mo&s;t convenient for it.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, I would not have the brethren keep their corn in their ca&s;tles, as I hear the Onondagas do, but bury it a great way in the woods, where few people may know where it is, for fear of &s;uch an accident as has happened to the Senecas.</P>
<P N="8">8thly, I have given my advice in your general a&s;&s;embly, by mr. Dirk We&s;&s;els and Akus, the interpreter, how you are to manage your parties, and how nece&s;&s;ary it is to get pri&s;oners to exchange for your own men that are pri&s;oners with the French; and I am glad to hear that the brethren are &s;o united as mr. Dirk We&s;&s;els tells me you are, and that there was no rotten members nor French &s;pies among you.</P>
<P N="9">9thly, The brethren may remember my advice, which I &s;ent you this &s;pring, not to go to Cadarackui; if you had, they would have &s;erved you, as they did your people that came from hunting thither, for I told you that I knew the French better than you did.</P>
<P N="10">10thly, There was no advice or propo&s;ition that I made to the brethren all the time that the prie&s;t lived at Ononda|ga, but what he wrote to Canada, as I found by one of his letters, which he gave to an Indian to carry to Canada, but which was brought hither; therefore, I de&s;ire the brethren not to receive him, or any French prie&s;t any more, having &s;ent for Engli&s;h prie&s;ts, with whom you may be &s;upplied to your content.</P>
<P N="11">11thly, I would have the brethren look out &s;harp, for fear of being &s;urpri&s;ed. I believe all the &s;trength of the French will be at their frontier places, viz. at Cadarackui, and Oniagara, where they have built a fort now, and at Trois Rivieres, Montreal, and Chambly.</P>
<P N="12">12thly, Let me put you in mind again, not to make any treaties without my means, which will be more advantage|ous for you, than your doing it for your&s;elves; for then you will be looked upon as the king of England's &s;ubjects; and let me know, from time to time, every thing that is done.</P>

<P>Not long after this interview, a con&s;iderable party of Mo|haws and Mahikanders, or river Indians, be&s;et fort Chambly, burnt &s;everal hou&s;es, and returned with many captives to Albany. Forty Onondagas, about the &s;ame time, &s;urpri&s;ed a few &s;oldiers near fort Frontenac, whom they confined in|&s;tead of the Indians &s;ent home to the gallies, notwith&s;tand|ing the utmo&s;t addre&s;s was u&s;ed to regain them, by Lamber|ville, a French prie&s;t, who delivered them two belts, to en|gage their kindne&s;s to the pri&s;oners, and prevent their join|ing the quarrel with the Senecas. The belts being &s;ent to colonel Dongan, he wrote to De Nonville, to demand the rea&s;on of their being delivered. Pere le Vaillant was &s;ent here about the beginning of the year 1688, under colour of bringing an an&s;wer, but in reality as a &s;py Col. Dongan told him, that no peace could be made with the five nations, unle&s;s the Indians &s;ent to the gallies, and the Caghnuaga pro&s;elytes were returned to their re&s;pective cantons, the forts at Niagara and Frontenac rai&s;ed, and the Senecas had &s;atisfaction made them, for the damage they had &s;u&s;tained. The je&s;uit, in his return, was ordered not to vi&s;it the Mo|hawks.</P>
<P>Dongan, who was fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the Indian intere&s;t to the Engli&s;h colonies, was for compelling the French to apply to him in all their affairs with the Five Nations; while they, on the other hand, were for treating with them independent of the Engli&s;h. For this rea&s;on, a|mong others, he refu&s;ed them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they frequent|ly required, till they acknowledged the dependence of the confederates on the Engli&s;h crown. King James, a poor, bigotted, popi&s;h, prie&s;t-ridden prince, ordered his governor to give up this point, and to per&s;uade the Five Nations to &s;end me&s;&s;engers to Canada, to receive propo&s;als of peace from the French. For this purpo&s;e, a ce&s;&s;ation of arms and mutual delivery of pri&s;oners was agreed upon. Near 1200 of the confederates attended this negociation at Mon|treal, and in their &s;peech to De Nonville, in&s;i&s;ted with great re&s;olution, upon the terms propo&s;ed by colonel Dongan to father le Vaillant. The French governor declared his wil|lingne&s;s to put an end to the war, if all his allies might be included in the treaty of peace, if the Mohawks and Sene|cas would &s;end deputies to &s;ignify their concurrence, and the French might &s;upply fort Frontenac with provi&s;ions. The confederates, according to the French accounts, acced|ed to the&s;e conditions, and the treaty was ratified in the field. But a new rupture not long after en&s;ued, from a cau&s;e en|tirely un&s;u&s;pected. The Dinondadies had lately inclined to
<PB N="71" REF="024800_0067_0FCD62E552782258">the Engli&s;h trade at Mi&s;&s;ilimakinac; and their alliance was therefore become &s;u&s;pected by the French. Adario, their chief, thought to regain the ancient confidence, which had been repo&s;ed in his countrymen, by a notable action again&s;t the Five Nations; and for that purpo&s;e put him&s;elf at the head of 100 men: nothing was more di&s;agreeable to him, than the pro&s;pect of peace between the French and the confederates; for that event would not only render the a|mity of the Dinondadies u&s;ele&s;s, but give the French an op|portunity of re&s;enting their late favourable conduct towards the Engli&s;h. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, out of affec|tion to his country, he intercepted the amba&s;&s;adors of the Five Nations, at one of the falls in Cadarackui river, killed &s;ome, and took others pri&s;oners, telling them that the French governor had informed him, that fifty warriors of the Five Nations were coming that way. As the Dinonda|dies and confederates were then at war, the amba&s;&s;adors were a&s;toni&s;hed at the perfidy of the French governor, and could not help communicating the de&s;ign of their journey, Adario, in pro&s;ecution of his crafty &s;cheme, counterfeited the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, anger, and &s;hame, on being made the ig|nominious tool of de Nonville's treachery, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Dekane&s;ora, the principal amba&s;&s;ador, &s;aid to him, "Go, my brethren, I untie your bonds, and &s;end you home again, though our nations be at war. The French go|vernor has made me commit &s;o black an action, that I &s;hall never be ea&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ter it, till the Five Nations &s;hall have taken full revenge." This outrage and indignity upon the rights of amba&s;&s;adors, the truth of which they did not in the lea&s;t doubt, animated the confederates, to the keene&s;t thir&s;t af|ter revenge; and accordingly 1200 of their men, on the 26th of July 1688, landed on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land of Mon|treal, while the French were in perfect &s;ecurity; burnt their hou&s;es, &s;acked their plantations, and put to the &s;word all the men, women, and children, without the &s;kirts of the town. A thou&s;and French were &s;lain in this inva&s;ion, and twenty &s;ix carried into captivity, and burnt alive. Many more were made pri&s;oners in another attack in October, and the lower part of the i&s;land wholly de&s;troyed. Only three of the confederates were lo&s;t, in all this &s;cene of mi|&s;ery and de&s;olation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have followed dr. Colden in the account of this at|tack, who differs from Charlevoix. That je&s;uit tells us, that the inva&s;ion was late in Augu&s;t, and the Indians 1500 &s;trong; and as to the lo&s;s of the French, he dimini&s;hes it to only 200 &s;ouls.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="024800_0068_0FCD62E6F4E5FE00">
Never before did Canada &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a heavy blow. The news of this attack on Montreal no &s;ooner reached the gar|ri&s;on at the lake Ontario, than they &s;et fire to the two barks, which they had built there, and abandoned the fort, leaving a match to 28 barrels of powder, de&s;igned to blow up the works. The &s;oldiers went down the river in &s;uch precipi|tation, that one of the battoes and her crew were all lo&s;t in &s;hooting a fall. The confederates in the mean time &s;eized the fort, the powder, and the &s;tores; and of all the French allies, who were va&s;tly numerous, only the Nepicirinians and Kikabous adhered to them in their calamities. The Utawawas and &s;even other nations in&s;tantly made peace with the Engli&s;h; and but for the uncommon &s;agacity and addre&s;s of the &s;ieur Perot, the we&s;tern Indians would have murdered every Frenchman among them. Nor did the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the Canadians end here. Numerous &s;couts from the five nations, continually infe&s;ted their borders. The fre|quent depredations that were made, prevented them from the cultivation of their fields, and a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing famine raged through the whole country. Nothing but the ignorance of the Indians, in the art of attacking fortified places, &s;aved Canada from being now utterly cut off. It was therefore un&s;peakably fortunate to the French, that the Indians had no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Engli&s;h, and as unfortunate to us, that our colonies were then incapable of affording &s;uccours to the confederates, through the malignant influence of tho&s;e execrable mea&s;ures, which were pur&s;ued under the infa|mous reign of king James the &s;econd. Colonel Dongan, whatever his conduct might have been in civil affairs, did all that he could in tho&s;e relating to the Indians, and fell at la&s;t into the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, through his zeal for the true intere&s;t of the province.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting in Canada, a &s;cene of the greate&s;t importance was opening at New-York. A general di&s;affection to the government prevailed among the people. Papi&s;ts began to &s;ettle in the colony, under the &s;miles of the governor. The collector of the revenues, and &s;everal principal officers, threw off the ma&s;k, and openly avowed their attachment to the doctrines of Rome. A Latin &s;chool was &s;et up, and the teacher &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected for a je&s;uit. The people of Long-I&s;land, who were di&s;appointed in their expectation of mighty boons, promi&s;ed by the go|vernor on his arrival, were become his per&s;onal enemies; and in a word, the whole body of the people trembled for the prote&s;tant cau&s;e. Here the leaven of oppo&s;ition fir&s;t be|gan to work. Their intelligence from England, of the de|&s;igns there in favour of the prince of Orange, blew up the
<PB N="73" REF="024800_0069_0FCD62E932BA4078">coals of di&s;content, and elevated the hopes of the di&s;affected. But no man dared to &s;pring in action, till after the rupture in Bo&s;ton. Sir Edmond Andro&s;s, who was perfectly devoted to the arbitrary mea&s;ures of king James, by his tyranny in New-England, had drawn upon him&s;elf the univer&s;al odium of a people, animated with the love of liberty and in the defence of it re&s;olute and courageous; and therefore, when they could no longer endure his de&s;potic rule, they &s;eized and impri&s;oned him, and afterwards &s;ent him to England. The government, in the mean time, was ve&s;ted in the hands of a committee for the &s;afety of the people, of which mr. Brad&s;treet was cho&s;en pre&s;ident. Upon the news of this event, &s;everal captains of our militia convened them&s;elves to concert mea&s;ures, in favour of the prince of Orange. A|mong the&s;e, Jacob Lei&s;ler was the mo&s;t active. He was a man in tolerable e&s;teem among the people, and of a mo|derate fortune, but de&s;titute of every qualification nece&s;&s;ary for the enterpri&s;e. Milborne, his &s;on-in-law, and Engli&s;hman, directed all his councils, while Lei&s;ler as ab&s;olutely influ|enced the other officers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing they contrived, was to &s;eize the garri&s;on in New-York; and the cu&s;tom, at that time, of guarding it every night by the militia, gave Lei&s;ler a fine opportunity of executing the de&s;ign. He entered it with forty nine men, and determined to hold it till the whole militia &s;hould join him. Colonel Dongan, who was about to leave the province, then lay embarked in the bay, having a little before re&s;igned the government to Francis Nichol&s;on, the lieutenant gover|nor. The council, civil officers, and migi&s;trates of the city, were again&s;t Lei&s;ler, and therefore many of his friends were at fir&s;t fearful of openly e&s;pou&s;ing a cau&s;e di&s;approved by the gentlemen of figure. For this rea&s;on, Lei&s;ler's fir&s;t de|claration in favour of the prince of Orange, was &s;ub&s;cribed only by a few, among &s;everal companies of the trained bands. While the people, for four days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, were in the utmo&s;t perplexity to determine what part to choo&s;e, being &s;olicited by Lei&s;ler on the one hand, and threatened by the lieutenant governor on the other, the town was alarmed with a report, that three &s;hips were coming up, with or|ders from the prince of Orange. This fal&s;ehood was very &s;ea&s;onably propagated to &s;erve the intere&s;t of Lei&s;ler; for on that day, the 3d of June 1689, his party was augmented by the addition of &s;ix captains and 400 men in New-York, and a company of 70 men from Ea&s;t Che&s;ter, who all &s;ub&s;cribed a
<PB N="74" REF="024800_0070_0FCD62EC4C2EE580">&s;econd declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have taken an exact copy of it for the &s;atisfaction of the reader. "Whereas our intention tended only but to the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion, and the fort of this city, to the end that we may avoid and prevent the ra&s;h judgment of the world, in &s;o ju&s;t a de&s;ign; we have thought fit, to let every body know by the&s;e public proclamation, that till the &s;afe arryvell of the &s;hips, that we expect every day, from his royal highne&s;s the prince of Orange, with orders for the government of this country in the behalf of &s;uch per&s;on, as the &s;aid royal highne&s;s had cho&s;en, and honoured with the charge of a governor, that as &s;oon as the bearer of the &s;aid orders, &s;hall have let us &s;ee his power, then, and without any delay, we &s;hall execute the &s;aid or|ders punctually; declaring that we do intend to &s;ubmit and obey, not only the &s;aid orders, but al&s;o the bearer thereof, committed for the execution of the &s;ame. In witne&s;s hereof, we have &s;igned the&s;e pre&s;ents, the third of June 1689."</NOTE>, mutually covenanting to hold the fort for the prince. Colonel Dongan continued till this time in the harbour, waiting the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e commotions; and Nichol&s;on's party being now unable to contend with their opponents were totally di&s;per&s;ed, the lieutenant governor him&s;elf ab&s;conding, the very night after the la&s;t declaration was &s;igned.</P>
<P>Lei&s;ler being now in complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, &s;ent home an addre&s;s to king William and queen Mary, as &s;oon as he received the news of their acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. It is a tedious, incorrect, ill-drawn narrative of the grievances which the people had endured, and the methods lately ta|ken to &s;ecure them&s;elves, ending with a recognition of the &s;overeignty of the king and queen over the whole Engli&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s was &s;oon followed by a private letter from Lei&s;ler to king William, which, in very broken Engli&s;h, in|forms his maje&s;ty of the &s;tate of the garri&s;on, the repairs he had made to it, and the temper of the people, and con|cludes with &s;trong prote&s;tations of his &s;incerity, loyalty, and zeal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t Stoll, an en&s;ign, on the delivery of this let|ter to the king, had the honour to ki&s;s his maje&s;ty's hand; but Nichol&s;on the lieutenant-governor, and one Ennis, an epi&s;copal clergyman, arrived in England before him; and by fal&s;ely repre&s;enting the late mea&s;ures in New-York, as proceeding rather from their aver&s;ion to the church of Eng|land, than zeal for the prince of Orange, Lei&s;ler and his party mi&s;&s;ed the rewards and notice, which their activity
<PB N="75" REF="024800_0071_0FCD62EDBA095878">for the revolution ju&s;tly de&s;erved. For though the king made Stoll the bearer of his thanks to the people for their fidelity, he &s;o little regarded Lei&s;ler's complaints again&s;t Ni|chol&s;on, that he was &s;oon after preferred to the government of Virginia. Dongan returned to Ireland, and, it is &s;aid, &s;ucceeded to the earldom of Limerick.</P>
<P>Lei&s;ler's &s;udden inve&s;titure with &s;upreme power over the province, and the probable pro&s;pects of king William's ap|probation of his conduct, could not but excite the envy and jealou&s;y of the late council and magi&s;trates, who had refu|&s;ed to join in the glorious work of the revolution; and hence the &s;pring of all their aver&s;ion, both to the man and his mea&s;ures. Colonel Bayard, and Courtland the mayor of the city, were at the head of his opponents, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e a party again&s;t him in the city, they very early retired to Albany, and there endeavoured to foment the oppo&s;ition. Lei&s;ler, on the other hand, fearful of their influence, and to extingui&s;h the jealou&s;y of the people, thought it prudent, to admit &s;everal tru&s;ty per&s;ons to a par|ticipation of that power, which the militia on the 1&s;t of July had committed &s;olely to him&s;elf. In conjunction with the&s;e, (who, after the Bo&s;ton example, were called the com|mittee of &s;afety) he exerci&s;ed the government, a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf only the honour of being pre&s;ident in their councils. This model continued till the month of Decem|ber, when a packet arrived with a letter from the lords Carmarthen, Halifax, and others, directed "To Francis Nichol&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> or in his ab&s;ence, to &s;uch as for the time be|ing, take care for pre&s;erving the peace and admini&s;tering the laws, in their maje&s;ties' province of New-York in Ame|rica." This letter was dated the 29th of July, and was ac|companied with another from lord Nottingham, dated the next day, which, after empowering Nichol&s;on to take upon him the chief command, and to appoint for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance as many of the principal freeholders and inhabitants as he &s;hould think fit, requiring al&s;o "to do every thing apper|taining to the office of lieutenant-governor, according to the laws and cu&s;toms of New-York, until further orders."</P>
<P>Nichol&s;on being ab&s;conded when this packet came to hand, Lei&s;ler con&s;idered the letter as directed to him&s;elf, and from this time i&s;&s;ued all kinds of commi&s;&s;ions in his own name, a&s;&s;uming the title, as well as authority, of lieute|nant-governor. On the 11th of December, he &s;ummoned the committee of &s;afety, and agreeable to their advice, &s;wore the following per&s;ons for his council: Peter de Lanoy, Samuel Staats, Hendrick Jan&s;en, and Johannes Vermilie, for New-York. Gerardus Beekman, for King's county. For
<PB N="76" REF="024800_0072_0FCD62EF11D82D20">Queen's county, Samuel Ed&s;el; Thomas Williams for We&s;t-Che&s;ter, and William Lawrence for Orange county.</P>
<P>Except the ea&s;tern inhabitants of Long I&s;land, all the &s;outhern part of the colony chearfully &s;ubmitted to Lei&s;|ler's command. The principal freeholders, however, by re|&s;pectful letters gave him hopes of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and thereby prevented his betaking him&s;elf to arms, while they were privately &s;oliciting the colony of Connecticut, to take them under its juri&s;diction. They had, indeed, no aver&s;ion to Lei&s;ler's authority, in favour of any other party in the province, but were willing to be incorporated with a peo|ple, from whence they had originally colonized; and therefore as &s;oon as Connecticut declined their reque&s;t, they openly appeared to be advocates for Lei&s;ler. At this junc|ture the Long I&s;land repre&s;entation was drawn up, which I have more than once had occa&s;ion to mention.</P>
<P>The people of Albany, in the mean time, were determi|ned to hold the garri&s;on and city for king William, inde|pendent of Lei&s;ler; and on the 26th of October, which was before the packet arrived from lord Nottingham, form|ed them&s;elves into a convention for that purpo&s;e. As Lei&s;|ler's attempt, to reduce this country to his command, was the original cau&s;e of the future divi&s;ions in the province, and in the end brought about his own ruin, it may not be improper to &s;ee the re&s;olution of the convention, a copy of which was &s;ent down to him at large.</P>

<P>Taking it for granted, that Lei&s;ler at New-York, and the convention at Albany, were equally affected to the revolu|tion, nothing could be more egregiou&s;ly fooli&s;h, than the conduct of both parties, who, by their inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, threw the province into convul&s;ions, and &s;owed the &s;eeds of mutual hatred and animo&s;ity, which, for a long time after, greatly embarra&s;&s;ed the public affairs of the colony. When Albany declared for the prince of Orange, there was no|thing el&s;e that Lei&s;ler could properly require: and rather than &s;acrifice the public peace of the province, to the trifling honour of re&s;i&s;ting a man who had no evil de&s;igns, Albany ought in prudence to have delivered the garri&s;on into his hands, till the king's definitive orders &s;hould arrive. But while Lei&s;ler, on the one hand, was inebriated with his new-gotten power, &s;o on the other, Bayard, Courtland, Schuyler, and others, could not brook a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the authority of a man, mean in his abilities, and inferior in his degree. Animated by the&s;e principles, both parties pre|pared, the one to reduce, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, the other to retain, the garri&s;on of Albany. Mr. Living&s;ton, a principal agent for the convention, retired into Connecti|cut, to &s;olicit the aid of that colony, for the protection of the frontiers again&s;t the French. Lei&s;ler, &s;u&s;pecting that they were to be u&s;ed again&s;t him, endeavoured not only to prevent the&s;e &s;upplies, but wrote letters, to have Living|&s;ton
<PB N="78" REF="024800_0074_0FCD62F2CEFDD460">apprehended, as an enemy to the reigning powers, and, to procure &s;uccours from Bo&s;ton, fal&s;ely repre&s;ented the convention, as in the intere&s;t of the French and king James.</P>
<P>Jacob Milborne was commi&s;&s;ioned for the reduction of Albany. Upon his arrival there, a great number of the in|habitants armed them&s;elves, and repaired to the fort, then commanded by mr. Schuyler, while many others followed the other members of the convention, to a conference with him at the city-hall. Milborne, to pro&s;elyte the crowd, de|claimed much again&s;t king James, popery, and arbitrary power; but his oratory was lo&s;t upon the hearers, who, after &s;everal meetings, &s;till adhered to the convention. Milborne then advanced with a few men up to the fort, and mr. Schuyler had the utmo&s;t difficulty to prevent both his own men, and the Mohawks, who were then in Albany, and perfectly devoted to his &s;ervice, from firing upon Mil|borne's party, which con&s;i&s;ted of an incon&s;iderable num|ber. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, he thought proper to retreat, and &s;oon after departed from Albany. In the &s;pring, he commanded another party upon the &s;ame errand; and the di&s;tre&s;s of the country, on an Indian irruption, gave him all the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. No &s;ooner was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the garri&s;on, than mo&s;t of the principal members of the conven|tion ab&s;conded. Upon which, their effects were arbitrarily &s;eized and confi&s;cated, which &s;o highly exa&s;perated the &s;uf|ferers, that their po&s;terity, to this day, cannot &s;peak of the&s;e troubles, without the bittere&s;t invectives again&s;t Lei&s;ler and all his adherents.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e inte&s;tine confu&s;ions at New-York, the people of New-England were engaged in a war with the Owenagungas, Ourages, and Penocoks. Between the&s;e and the Schakook Indians, there was then a friendly communi|cation, and the &s;ame was &s;u&s;pected of the Mohawks, among whom, &s;ome of the Owenagungas had taken &s;anctuary. This gave ri&s;e to a conference, between &s;everal commi&s;&s;ion|ers from Bo&s;ton, Plymouth, and Connecticut, and the five nations, at Albany, in September 1689, the former endea|vouring to engage the latter, again&s;t tho&s;e ea&s;tern Indians, who were then at war with the New-England colonies. Tabajadoris, a Mohawk &s;achem, in a long oration, an|&s;wered the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;age; and, however improbable it may &s;eem to Europeans, repeated all that had been &s;aid the preceding day. The art they have in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their memo|ries is this. The &s;achem who pre&s;ides, has a bundle of &s;ticks prepared for the purpo&s;e, and at the clo&s;e of every principal article of the me&s;&s;age delivered to them, gives a
<PB N="79" REF="024800_0075_0FCD62F8B873FEF0">&s;tick to another &s;achem, charging him with the remem|brance of it. By this means the orator, after a previous conference with the Indians, is prepared to repeat every part of the me&s;&s;age, and give it its proper reply. This cu&s;|tom is invariably pur&s;ued in all their public treaties.</P>
<P>The conference did not an&s;wer the expectation of the people of New-England, the five nations di&s;covering a great di&s;inclination to join in the ho&s;tilities again&s;t the ea&s;tern Indians. To atone for which, they gave the highe&s;t pro|te&s;tations of their willingne&s;s to di&s;tre&s;s the French, again&s;t whom the Engli&s;h had declared war, on the 7th of May preceding. That part of the &s;peech ratifying their friend|&s;hip, with the Engli&s;h colonies, is &s;ingularly expre&s;&s;ed. "We promi&s;e to pre&s;erve the chain inviolably, and wi&s;h that the &s;un may always &s;hine in peace, over all our heads that are comprehended in this chain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Indians' conception of the league between them and us, is couched under the idea of a chain extended from a &s;hip to a tree; and every renewal of this league they call brightening the chain.</NOTE>. We give two belts. One for the &s;un, and the other for its beams. We make fa&s;t the roots of the tree of peace and tranquillity which is plant|ed in this place. Its roots extend as far as the utmo&s;t of your colonies; if the French &s;hould come to &s;hake this tree, we would feel it by the motion of its roots, which extend into our country. But we tru&s;t it will not be in the gover|nor of Canada's power to &s;hake this tree, which has been &s;o firmly, and long planted with us."</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more advantageous to the&s;e co|lonies, and e&s;pecially to New-York, than the late &s;ucce&s;s of the five nations again&s;t Canada. The mi&s;eries to which the French were reduced, rendered us &s;ecure again&s;t their in|roads, till the work of the revolution was in a great mea|&s;ure accompli&s;hed; and to their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, we mu&s;t principally a&s;cribe the defeat of the French de&s;ign, about this time, to make a conque&s;t of the province. De Callieres, who went to France in 1688, fir&s;t projected the &s;cheme<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix has publi&s;hed an extract of the memorial pre&s;ented to the French king. The force demanded for this enterpri&s;e, was to con&s;i&s;t of 1300 regulars and 300 Canadi|ans. Albany was &s;aid to be fortified only by an inclo&s;ure of &s;tockadoes and a little fort with four ba&s;tions; and that it contained by 150 &s;oldiers and 300 inhabitants. That New-York, the capital of the province, was open, had a &s;tone fort with four ba&s;tions, and about four hundred inha|bitants, divided into eight companies.</NOTE>; and the troubles in England encouraged the
<PB N="80" REF="024800_0076_0FCD62F99C6057E0">French court to make the attempt. Caffiniere commanded the &s;hips, which &s;ailed for that purpo&s;e from Rochefort; &s;ub|ject, neverthele&s;s, to the count de Frontenac, who was ge|neral of the land forces, de&s;tined to march from Canada, by the route of Sorel-River and the lake Champlain. The fleet and troops arrived at Chebucta, the place of rendez|vous, in September; from whence the count proceeded to Quebec, leaving orders with Caffiniere, to &s;ail for New-York, and continue in the bay, in &s;ight of the city, but be|yond the fire of our cannon, till the 1&s;t of December; when, if he received no intelligence from him, he was ordered to return to France, after unlading the ammunition, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions at Port-Royal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Annapolis.</NOTE>. The count was in high &s;pi|rits, and fully determined upon the enterpri&s;e, till he ar|rived at Quebec; where the news of the &s;ucce&s;s of the five nations again&s;t Montreal, the lo&s;s of his favourite fort at lake Ontario, and the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, defeat|ed his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms, and broke up the expedition. De Nonville, who was recalled, carried the news of this di&s;appointment to the court of France, leaving the chief command of the country in the hands of count Frontenac. This gentleman was a man of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ge, and well acquainted with the affairs of that country. He was then in the 68th year of his age, and yet &s;o far from con&s;ulting his ea&s;e, that in a few days af|ter he landed at Quebec, he re-embarked in a canoe, for Mon|treal, where his pre&s;ence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to ani|mate the inhabitants, and regain their Indian alliances. A war, between the Engli&s;h and French crowns, being broke out, the count betook him&s;elf to every art, for concluding a peace between Canada and the five nations; and for this purpo&s;e, the utmo&s;t civilities were &s;hown to Taweraket and the other Indians, who had been &s;ent to France by de Non|ville, and were now returned. Three of tho&s;e Indians, who, doubtle&s;s, were &s;truck with the grandeur and glory of the French monarch, were properly &s;ent on the im|portant me&s;&s;age of conciliating the friend&s;hip of the five na|tions. The&s;e, agreeable to our alliance, &s;ent two &s;achems to Albany, in December, with notice, that a council for that purpo&s;e was to be held at Onondaga. It is a ju&s;t reflexion upon the people of Albany, that they regarded the treaty
<PB N="81" REF="024800_0077_0FCD62FB13D0C100">&s;o &s;lightly, as only to &s;end four Indians and the interpreter with in&s;tructions, in their name, to di&s;&s;uade the confederates from a ce&s;&s;ation of arms; while the French, on the other hand, had then a je&s;uit among the Oneydoes. The coun|cil began on the 22d of January, 1690, and con&s;i&s;ted of eighty &s;achems. Sadekanaghtie, an Onondaga chief, open|ed the conference. The whole was managed with great art and formality, and concluded in &s;howing a di&s;po&s;ition to make peace with the French, without perfecting it; guard|ing, at the &s;ame time, again&s;t giving the lea&s;t umbrage to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Among other mea&s;ures to detach the five nations from the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, and rai&s;e the depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of the Cana|dians, the count de Frontenac thought proper to &s;end out &s;everal parties again&s;t the Engli&s;h colonies. D'Aillebout, de Mantel, and le Moyne, commanded that again&s;t New-York, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred French and &s;ome Caghnu|aga Indians, who being pro&s;elytes from the Mohawks, were perfectly acquainted with that country. Their orders were, in general, to attack New-York; but pur&s;uing the advice of the Indians, they re&s;olved, in&s;tead of Albany, to &s;urpri&s;e Schenectady, a village &s;eventeen miles north-we&s;t from it, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Mohawks. The peo|ple of Schenectady, though they had been informed of the de&s;igns of the enemy; were in the greate&s;t &s;ecurity; judg|ing it impracticable, for any men to march &s;everal hundred miles, in the depth of winter, through the &s;now, bearing their provi&s;ions on their backs. Be&s;ides, the village was in as much confu&s;ion as the re&s;t of the province; the officers, who were po&s;ted there, being unable to pre&s;erve a regular watch, or any kind of military order. Such was the &s;tate of Schenectady, as repre&s;ented by colonel Schuyler, who was at that time mayor of the city of Albany, and at the head of the convention. A copy of his letter to the neigh|bouring colonies, concerning this de&s;cent upon Schenectady dated the 15th of February 1689-90, I have now lying be|fore me under his own hand.</P>
<P>After two and twenty days march, the enemy fell in with Schenectady, on the 8th of February; and were reduced to &s;uch &s;treights, that they had thoughts of &s;urrendering them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. But their &s;couts, who were a day or two in the village entirely un&s;u&s;pected, returned with &s;uch encouraging accounts of the ab&s;olute &s;ecurity of the people, that the enemy determined on the attack. They entered, on Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, at the gates, which were found un&s;hut; and, that every hou&s;e might be inve&s;ted at the &s;ame time, divided into &s;mall par|ties
<PB N="82" REF="024800_0078_0FCD57F5951FEDB0">of &s;ix, or &s;even men. The inhabitants were in a pro|found &s;leep, and unalarmed, till their doors were broke open. Never were people in a more wretched con&s;terna|tion. Before they were ri&s;en from their beds, the enemy en|tered their hou&s;es; and began the perpetration of the mo&s;t inhuman barbarities. No tongue, &s;ays colonel Schuy|ler, can expre&s;s the cruelties that were committed. The whole village was in&s;tantly in a blaze. Women with child ripped open, and their infants ca&s;t into the flames, or da&s;h|ed again&s;t the po&s;ts of the doors. Sixty per&s;ons peri&s;hed in the ma&s;&s;acre, and twenty &s;even were carried into captivity. The re&s;t fled naked towards Albany, through a deep &s;now which fell that very night in a terrible &s;torm; and twenty-five of the&s;e fugitives lo&s;t their limbs in the flight, through the &s;everity of the fro&s;t. The news of this dreadful tragedy reached Albany, about break of day; and univer&s;al dread &s;eized the inhabitants of that city, the enemy being report|ed to be one thou&s;and four hundred &s;trong. A party of hor&s;e was immediately di&s;patched to Schenectady, and a few Mohawks then in the town, fearful of being intercept|ed, were with difficulty &s;ent to appri&s;e their own ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>The Mohawks were unacquainted with this bloody &s;cene, till two days after it happened; our me&s;&s;engers being &s;carce able to travel through the great depth of the &s;now. The ene|my, in the mean time, pillaged the town of Schenectady till noon the next day; and then went off with their plunder, and about forty of their be&s;t hor&s;es. The re&s;t, with all the cattle they could find, lay &s;laughtered in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the French, in this attack, was to alarm the fears of our Indian allies, by &s;howing that we were in|capable of defending them. Every art al&s;o was u&s;ed to con|ciliate their friend&s;hip; for they not only &s;pared tho&s;e Mo|hawks who were found in Schenectady, but &s;everal other particular per&s;ons in compliment to the Indians, who re|que&s;ted that favour. Several women and children were al&s;o relea&s;ed at the de&s;ire of captain Glen, to whom the French offered no violence; the officer declaring he had &s;trict or|ders again&s;t it, on the &s;core of his wife's civilities to cer|tain French captives, in the time of colonel Dongan.</P>
<P>The Mohawks, con&s;idering the cajoling arts of the French, and that the Caghnuagas who were with them, were once a part of their own body, behaved as well as could be rea|&s;onably expected. They joined a party of young men from Albany, fell upon the rear of the enemy, and either killed or captivated five and twenty. Several &s;achems, in the mean time, came to Albany, and very affectingly addre&s;&s;ed the inhabitants, who were ju&s;t ready to abandon the coun|try;
<PB N="83" REF="024800_0079_0FCD62FFA2838688">urging their &s;tay, and exciting a union of all the Eng|li&s;h colonies again&s;t Canada. Their &s;entiments concerning the French appear from the following &s;peech of condo|lence. "Brethren, we do not think, that what the French have done can be called a victory: it is only a farther proof of their cruel deceit: the governor of Canada &s;ent to Onondaga, and talks to us of peace with our whole hou&s;e; but war was in his heart, as you now &s;ee by woful experi|ence. He did the &s;ame, formerly, at Cadaraqui, and in the Seneca's country. This is the third time he has acted &s;o de|ceitfully. He has broken open our hou&s;e, at both ends; formerly in the Seneca's country, and now here. We hope however to be revenged of them."</P>
<P>Agreeable to this declaration, the Indians &s;oon after treated the chevalier d'Eau and the re&s;t of the French me&s;|&s;engers, who came to conclude the peace propo&s;ed by Taweraket, with the utmo&s;t indignity; and afterwards delivered them up to the Engli&s;h. Be&s;ides this, their &s;couts harra&s;&s;ed the borders of the enemy, and &s;ell upon a party of French and Indians, in the river, about one hundred and twenty miles above Montreal, under the command of Lou|vigni, a captain who was going to Mi&s;&s;ilimakinac, to pre|vent the conclu&s;ion of the peace, between the Utawawas and Quatoghies, with the five nations. The lo&s;s in this &s;kirmi&s;h was nearly equal on both &s;ides. One of our pri&s;on|ers was delivered to the Utawawas, who ate him. In re|venge for this barbarity, the Indians attacked the i&s;land of Montreal at Trembling Point, and killed an officer and twelve men; while another party carried off about fifteen pri&s;oners taken at Riviere Puan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, whom they afterwards &s;lew, through fear of their pur&s;uers; and others burnt the French plantations at St. Aeurs. But what rendered this year mo&s;t remarkable, was the expedition of &s;ir William Phips again&s;t Quebec. He &s;ailed up the river with a fleet of thirty-two &s;ail, and came before the city in October. Had he improved his time and &s;trength, the conque&s;t would have been ea&s;y; but by &s;pending three days in idle con&s;ultations, the French governor brought in his forces, and entertained &s;uch a mean opinion of the Engli&s;h knight, that he not only de&s;pi&s;ed his &s;ummons to &s;urrender, but &s;ent a verbal an&s;wer, in which he called king William an u&s;urper, and poured the utmo&s;t contempt upon his &s;ubjects. The me&s;|&s;enger, who carried the &s;ummons, in&s;i&s;ted upon a written an&s;wer, and that within an hour; but the count de Frontenac ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, adding, "I'll an&s;wer your ma&s;ter by the mouth of my cannon, that he may learn that a man of my condition is not to be &s;ummoned in this man|ner."
<PB N="84" REF="024800_0080_0FCD63048CA01610">Upon this, &s;ir William made two attempts to land below the town, but was repul&s;ed by the enemy, with con|&s;iderable lo&s;s of men, cannon and baggage. Several of the &s;hips al&s;o cannonaded the city, but without any &s;ucce&s;s. The forts at the &s;ame time returned the fire and obliged them to retire in di&s;order. The French writers, in their accounts of this expedition, univer&s;ally cen&s;ure the conduct of &s;ir William, though they confe&s;s the valour of his troops.

<P>If Lei&s;ler had delivered the garri&s;on to colonel Slough|ter, as he ought to have done, upon his fir&s;t landing, be|&s;ides extingui&s;hing, in a great degree, the animo&s;ities then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, he would, doubtle&s;s, have attracted the favoura|ble notice, both of the governor and the crown. But being a weak man, he was &s;o intoxicated with the love of power, that, though he had been well informed of Sloughter's ap|pointment to the government, he not only &s;hut him&s;elf up
<PB N="86" REF="024800_0082_0FCD630710222850">in the fort with Bayard and Nichols, whom he had, before that time, impri&s;oned, but refu&s;ed to deliver them up, or to &s;urrender the garri&s;on. From this moment, he lo&s;t all credit with the governor, who joined the other party again&s;t him. On the &s;econd demand of the fort, Milborne and Delanoy came out, under pretence of conferring with his excellency, but in reality to di&s;cover his de&s;igns. Slough|ter, who con&s;idered them as rebels, threw them both into goal. Lei&s;ler, upon this event, thought proper to abandon the fort, which colonel Sloughter immediately entered. Bayard and Nichols were now relea&s;ed from their confine|ment, and &s;worn of the privy council. Lei&s;ler having thus ruined his cau&s;e, was apprehended with many of his adhe|rents, and a commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer i&s;&s;ued to &s;ir Thomas Robin&s;on, colonel Smith, and others, for their trials.</P>
<P>In vain did they plead the merit of their zeal for king William, &s;ince they had &s;o lately oppo&s;ed his governor. Lei&s;ler, in particular, endeavoured to ju&s;tify his conduct, in&s;i&s;ting, that lord Nottingham's letter entitled him to act in the quality of lieutenant-governor. Whether it was through ignorance or &s;ycophancy, I know not: but the judges, in&s;tead of pronouncing their own &s;entiments upon this part of the pri&s;oner's defence, referred it to the go|vernor and council, praying their opinion, whether that letter "or any other letters, or papers, in the packet from White-hall, can be under&s;tood, or interpreted, to be and contain, any power, or direction to captain Lei&s;ler, to take the government of this province upon him&s;elf, or that the admini&s;tration thereupon be holden good in law." The an|&s;wer was, as might have been expected, in the negative; and Lei&s;ler and his &s;on were condemned to death for high trea&s;on. The&s;e violent mea&s;ures drove many of the inhabi|tants, who were fearful of being apprehended into the neighbouring colonies, which &s;hortly after occa&s;ioned the pa&s;&s;ing an act of general indemnity.</P>
<P>From the &s;urrender of the province, to the year 1683, the inhabitants were ruled by the duke's governors and their councils, who, from time to time, made rules and orders, which were e&s;teemed to be binding as laws. The&s;e, about the year 1674, were regularly collected under alphabetical titles; and a fair copy of them remains, among our records, to this day. They are commonly known by the name of the duke's laws. The title page of the book, written in the old court hand, is in the&s;e bald words,</P>

<P>Before this hou&s;e proceeded to pa&s;s any acts, they unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved: "That all the laws con&s;ented to by the general a&s;&s;embly, under James duke of York, and the liber|ties and privileges therein contained, granted to the people, and declared to be their rights, not being ob&s;erved, nor ratified and approved by his royal highne&s;s, nor the late
<PB N="89" REF="024800_0085_0FCD630DE6FDEB18">king, are null and void, and of none effect; and al&s;o, the &s;everal ordinances, made by the late governors and councils, being contrary to the con&s;titution of England, and the practice of the government of their maje&s;ties' other plantations in America, are likewi&s;e null and void, and of no effect, nor force, within this province."</P>
<P>Among the principal laws enacted at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, we may mention that for e&s;tabli&s;hing the revenue, which was drawn into precedent. The &s;ums rai&s;ed by it, were made payable into the hands of the receiver-general, and i&s;&s;ued by the governor's warrant. By this means the governor became, for a &s;ea&s;on, independent of the people; and hence we find frequent in&s;tances of the a&s;&s;emblies contending with him for the di&s;charge of debts to private per&s;ons, contracted on the faith of the government.</P>
<P>Antecedent to the revolution, innumerable were the con|trover&s;ies relating to public town&s;hips and private rights; and hence, an act was now pa&s;&s;ed, for the confirmation of an|cient patents and grants, intended to put an end to tho&s;e de|bates. A law was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of courts of ju&s;tice, tho' a perpetual act had been made to that purpo&s;e in 1683, and the old court of a&s;&s;ize entirely di&s;&s;olved in 1684. As this enacted in 1691, was a temporary law, it may hereafter be di&s;puted, as it has been already, whether the pre&s;ent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of our courts, for general juri&s;diction, by an or|dinance, can con&s;i&s;t even with the preceding act, or the general rules of law. Upon the erection of the &s;upreme court, a chief ju&s;tice, and four a&s;&s;i&s;tant judges, with an at|torney general, were appointed. The chief ju&s;tice, Jo&s;eph Dudley, had a &s;alary of 130<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum: John&s;on, the &s;e|cond judge, 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and both were payable out of the revenue: but William Smith, Stephen Van Courtlandt, and William Pinhorne, the other judges, and Newton, the attorney-gen|eral, had nothing allowed for their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It has, more than once, been a &s;ubject of animated debate, whether the people, in this colony, have a right to be re|pre&s;ented in a&s;&s;embly, or whether it be a privilege enjoyed, thro' the grace of the crown. A memorable act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, virtually declared in favour of the former opinion, upon that, and &s;everal other of the principal and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing liberties of Engli&s;hmen. It mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s, be confe&s;&s;ed, that king William was afterwards plea&s;ed to re|peal that law, in the year 1697<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was entitled, "An act declaring what are the rights and privileges of their maje&s;ties' &s;ubjects, inhabiting within their province of New-York."</NOTE>.</P>

Colonel Sloughter propo&s;ed, immediately after the &s;e&s;|&s;ion, to &s;et out to Albany; but as Lei&s;ler's party were en|raged at his impri&s;onment, and the late &s;entence again&s;t him, his enemies were afraid new troubles would &s;pring up in the ab&s;ence of the governor; for this rea&s;on, both the a&s;&s;embly and council advi&s;ed that the pri&s;oners &s;hould be immediately executed. Sloughter, who had no inclination to favour them in this reque&s;t, cho&s;e rather to delay &s;uch a violent &s;tep, being fearful of cutting off two men, who had vigorou&s;ly appeared for the king, and &s;o &s;ignally con|tributed to the revolution. Nothing could be more di&s;agree|able to their enemies, who&s;e intere&s;t was deeply concerned in their de&s;truction. And therefore, when no other mea|&s;ures could prevail with the governor, tradition informs us, that a &s;umptuous fea&s;t was prepared, to which colonel Sloughter was invited. When his excellency's rea&s;on was drowned in his cups, the intreaties of the company pre|vailed with him to &s;ign the death warrant, and, before he recovered his &s;en&s;es, the pri&s;oners were executed. Lei&s;ler's &s;on afterwards carried home a complaint to king William, again&s;t the governor. His petition was referred, according to the common cour&s;e of plantation affairs, to the lords com|mi&s;&s;ioners of trade, who, after hearing the whole matter, reported on the 11th of March 1692, "That they were hum|bly of opinion, that Jacob Lei&s;ler and Jacob Milborne de|cea&s;ed, were condemned and had &s;uffered according to law." Their lord&s;hips, however, interceded for their families, as fit objects of mercy: and this induced queen Mary, who approved the report, on the 17th of March, to de|clare, "That upon the humble application of the relations of the &s;aid Jacob Lei&s;ler and Jacob Milborne decea&s;ed, her maje&s;ty will order the e&s;tates of Jacob Lei&s;ler and Jacob Mil|borne; to be re&s;tored to their families, as objects of her ma|je&s;ty's mercy." The bodies of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers were afterwards taken up and interred, with great pomp, in the old Dutch church, in the city of New-York. Their e&s;tates were re&s;tored to their families; and Lei&s;ler's children, in the public e&s;timation, are rather dignified, than di&s;graced, by the fall of their ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tractions, in the province, &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed the public attention, that our Indian allies, who had been loft &s;olely to contend with the common enemy, grew ex|tremely di&s;affected. The Mohawks, in particular, highly re&s;ented this conduct, and, at the in&s;tance of the Caghnu|agaes, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Canada, to confer with count Frontenac about a peace. To prevent this, colonel Slough|ter had an interview at Albany, in June, with the other
<PB N="91" REF="024800_0087_0FCD631117975E20">four nations, who expre&s;&s;ed their joy at &s;eeing a governor again in that place. They told him, that their ance&s;tors, as they had been informed, were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the ar|rival of the fir&s;t &s;hip in that country, and were curious to know what was in its huge belly. That they found chri&s;tians in it, and one Jacques, with whom they made a chain of friend&s;hip, which they had pre&s;erved to this day. All the Indians, except the Mohawks, a&s;&s;ured the governor at this meeting, of their re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute the war. The Mo|hawks confe&s;&s;ed their negociations with the French, that they had received a belt from Canada, and prayed the ad|vice of the governor, and afterwards renewed their league with all our colonies.</P>
<P>Sloughter &s;oon after returned to New-York, and ended a &s;hort, weak, and turbulent admini&s;tration; for he died &s;uddenly on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of July 1691. Some were not without &s;u&s;picions, that he came unfairly to his end: but the cer|tificate of the phy&s;ician and &s;urgeons who opened his body, by an order of council, confuted the&s;e conjectures; and his remains were interred in Stuyve&s;ant's vault, next to tho&s;e of the old Dutch governor.</P>
<P>At the time of Sloughter's decea&s;e, the government de|volved, according to the late act for declaring the rights of the people of this province, on the council, in which Jo|&s;eph Dudley had a right to pre&s;ide: but they committed the chief command to Richard Ingol&s;by, a captain of an inde|pendent company, who was &s;worn into the office of pre&s;i|dent on the the 26th of July 1698. Dudley, &s;oon afterwards, returned to this province, from Bo&s;ton, but did not think proper to di&s;pute Ingol&s;by's authority, though the latter had no title, nor the greate&s;t abilities for government, and was be&s;ides obnoxious to the party who had joined Lei&s;ler, having been an agent in the mea&s;ures which accompli&s;hed his ruin. To the late troubles, which were then recent, and the agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the council and a&s;|&s;embly we mu&s;t a&s;cribe it, that the former tacitly acknow|ledged Ingol&s;by's right to the pre&s;ident's chair; for they concurred with him, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal laws, in autumn and the &s;pring following, the validity of which have never yet been di&s;puted.</P>
<P>This &s;ummer, mayor Schuyler<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French, from his great influence at Albany, and activity among the Indians, concluded that he was gover|nor of that city; and hence, their hi&s;torians honour him with that title, though he was then only mayor of the cor|poration. "Pierre Schuyler (&s;ays Charlevoix) <HI>etoit un fort honnete homme.</HI>"</NOTE>, with a party of Mohawks,
<PB N="92" REF="024800_0088_0FCD63124EC47CB0">pa&s;&s;ed through the lake Champlain, and made a bold irrup|tion upon the French &s;ettlements, at the north end of it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Colden relates it as a tran&s;action of the year 1691, which is true: but he &s;uppo&s;es it was before &s;ir William Phips's attack upon Quebec, and thus falls into an anachron|i&s;m of a whole year, as I have already ob&s;erved.</NOTE> De Callieres, the governor of Montreal, to oppo&s;e him, collected a &s;mall army, of eight hundred men, and encamp|ed at la Prairie. Schuyler had &s;everal conflicts with the enemy, and &s;lew about three hundred of them, which ex|ceeded in number his whole party. The French, a&s;hamed of their ill &s;ucce&s;s, attribute it to the want of order, too many de&s;iring to have the command. But the true cau&s;e was, the ignorance of their officers in the Indian manner of fighting. They kept their men in a body, while ours po&s;ted them&s;elves behind trees, hidden from the enemy. Major Schuyler's de&s;ign, in this de&s;cent, was to animate the Indi|ans, and pre&s;erve their enmity with the French. They, accordingly, continued their ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, and, by frequent incur&s;ions, kept the country in con&s;tant alarm.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the French governor pre|&s;erved his &s;prightline&s;s and vigour, animating every body about him. After he had &s;erved him&s;elf of the Utawawas, who came to trade at Montreal, he &s;ent them home under the care of a captain and one hundred and ten men; and to &s;ecure their attachment to the French intere&s;t, gave them two Indian pri&s;oners, and, be&s;ides, &s;ent very con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to the we&s;tern Indians, in their alliance. The cap|tives were afterwards burnt. The five nations, in the mean time, grew more and more incen&s;ed, and continually har|ra&s;&s;ed the French borders. Mr. Beaucour, a young gentle|man, in the following winter, marched a body of about three hundred men to attack them at the i&s;thmus, at Niaga|ra. Incredible were the fatigues they underwent in this long march over the &s;how, bearing their provi&s;ions on their backs. Eighty men, of the five nations, oppo&s;ed the French party, and bravely maintained their ground, till mo&s;t of them were cut off. In return for which, the confederates, in &s;mall parties, ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age of the French through lake Ontario, and the river i&s;&s;uing out of it, and
<PB N="93" REF="024800_0089_0FCD63141AE9F420">cut off their communication with the we&s;tern Indians. An Indian, called Black Kettle, commanded in the&s;e incur&s;ions of the five nations, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which continued the whole &s;ummer, &s;o exa&s;perated the count, that he ordered an Indian pri&s;oner to be burnt alive. The bravery of this &s;avage was as extraordinary, as the torments inflicted on him were cruel. He &s;ung his military achievements without in|terruption, even while his bloody executioners practi&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible barbarities. They broiled his feet, thru&s;t his fingers into red hot pipes, cut his joints, and twi&s;ted the &s;inews with bars of iron. After this his &s;calp was ripped off, and hot &s;and poured on the wound.</P>
<P>In June 1692, captain Ingol&s;by met the five nations, at Albany, and encouraged them to per&s;evere in the war. The Indians declared their enmity to the French, in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms, and as heartily profe&s;&s;ed their friend&s;hip to us. "Brother Corlear," &s;aid the &s;achem, "we are all &s;ubjects of one great king and queen: we have one head, one heart, one intere&s;t, and are all engaged in the &s;ame war." The Indians, at the &s;ame time, did not forget, at this in|terview, to condemn the inactivity of the Engli&s;h, telling them, that the de&s;truction of Canada would not make one &s;ummer's work, again&s;t their united &s;trength, if vigorou&s;|ly exerted.</P>
<P>Colonel Benjamin Fletcher arrived with a commi&s;&s;ion to be governor, on the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1692, which was pub|li&s;hed the next day, before the following members, in council:</P>

<P>William Pinhorne, one of that board, being a non-re&s;i|dent, was refu&s;ed the oaths; and Jo&s;eph Dudley, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, removed, both from his &s;eat in council, and his office of chief ju&s;tice. Caleb Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ote and John Young &s;ucceeded them in council: and William Smith was &s;eated, in Dudley's place, on the bench.</P>
<P>Colonel Fletcher brought over with him a pre&s;ent to the colony, of arms, ammunition, and warlike &s;tores; in grati|tude for which, he exhorted the council and a&s;&s;embly, who were &s;itting at his arrival, to &s;end home an addre&s;s of thanks to the king. It con&s;i&s;ts, principally, of a repre&s;enta|tion of the great expen&s;e the province was continually at to defend the frontiers, and praying his maje&s;ty's direction, that the neighbouring colonies might be compelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to join their aid, for the &s;upport of Albany. The following pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="94" REF="024800_0090_0FCD63154D326EE8">in it &s;hows the &s;en&s;e of the legi&s;lature, upon a matter which has &s;ince been very much debated. "When the&s;e countries were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch We&s;t-India company, they always had pretences (and had the mo&s;t part of it with|in their actual juri&s;diction) to all that tract of land (with the i&s;lands adjacent) extending, from the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecti|cut river, to the lands lying on the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay, as a &s;uitable portion of land for one colony or govern|ment; all which, including the lands on the we&s;t of Dela|ware bay or river, were in the duke of York's grant, from his maje&s;ty king Charles the &s;econd, who&s;e governors al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e lands on the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay or river. By &s;everal grants, as well from the crown, as from the duke, the &s;aid province has been &s;o dimini&s;hed, that it is now decrea&s;ed to a very few towns and villages; the number of men fit to bear arms, in the whole government, not amounting to 3000, who are all reduced to great po|verty."</P>
<P>Fletcher was by profe&s;&s;ion a &s;oldier, a man of &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ions, and incon&s;iderable talents, very active, and equally avaricious. Nothing could be more fortunate to him, than his early acquaintance with major Schuyler, at Albany, at the treaty, for confirmation of the Indian alliance, the fall after his arrival. No man, then in this province, under&s;tood the &s;tate of our affairs with the five nations better than ma|jor Schuyler. He had &s;o great an influence over them, that whatever Quider<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tead of Peter, which they could not pronounce.</NOTE>, as they called him, recommended or di&s;approved, had the force of a law. This power over them was &s;upported, as it had been obtained, by repeated offices of kindne&s;s, and his &s;ingular bravery and activity in the defence of his country. The&s;e qualifications rendered him &s;ingularly &s;erviceable and nece&s;&s;ary, both to the province and the governor. For this rea&s;on, Fletcher took him in|to his confidence, and, on the 25th of October, rai&s;ed him to the council board. Under the tutelage of major Schuy|ler, the governor became daily more and more acquainted with our Indian affairs; his con&s;tant application to which, procured and pre&s;erved him a reputation and influence in the colony. Without this knowledge, and which was all that he had to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, his ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitations for money, his pa&s;&s;ionate temper and bigotted principles, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have rendered him obnoxious to the peo|ple, and kindled a hot fire of contention in the province.</P>
<P>The old French governor, who found that all his mea&s;ures for accompli&s;hing a peace with the five nations, proved abor|tive,

He ac|cordingly collected an army of &s;ix or &s;even hundred French and Indians, and &s;upplied them with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for a winter campaign. They &s;et out from Montreal, on the 15th of January, 1693; and after a march attended with incredible hard&s;hips, they pa&s;&s;ed by Schenectady, on the 6th of February, and, that night, captivated five men and &s;ome women and children, at the fir&s;t ca&s;tle of the Mo|hawks. The &s;econd ca&s;tle was taken with equal ea&s;e, the Indian inhabitants being in perfect &s;ecurity, and, for the mo&s;t part, at Schenectady. At the third, the enemy found about forty Indians in a war dance, de&s;igning to go out, up|on &s;ome enterpri&s;e, the next day. Upon their entering the ca&s;tle a conflict en&s;ued, in which the French lo&s;t about thir|ty men. Three hundred of our Indians were made captives, in this de&s;cent; and, but for the interce&s;&s;ion of the &s;avages in the French intere&s;t, would all have been put to the &s;word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Colden and the je&s;uit Charlevoix are not perfectly agreed in the hi&s;tory of this irruption. I have followed, &s;ometimes the former, and at other times the latter; ac|cording as the facts, more immediately, related to the con|duct of their re&s;pective countrymen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Indians were enraged, and with good rea&s;on, at the people of Schenectady, who gave them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the enemy, though they had notice of their marching by that village. But this was atoned for by the &s;uccours from Al|bany. Colonel Schuyler voluntarily headed a party of two hundred men, and went out again&s;t the enemy. On the 15th of February, he was joined by near three hundred Indians, ill armed, and many of them boys. A pretended de&s;erter, who came to di&s;&s;uade the Indians from the pur|&s;uit, informed him, the next day, that the French had built a fort, and waited to fight him; upon which he &s;ent to In|gol&s;by, the commandant at Albany, as well for a reinforce|ment as for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions; for the greate&s;t part of his men came out, with only a few bi&s;cuits in their pockets, and at the time they fell in with the enemy, on the 17th of the month, had been &s;everal days without any kind of food. Upon approaching the French army, &s;undry &s;kirmi&s;hes en|&s;ued; the enemy endeavouring to prevent our Indians from felling trees for their protection. Captain Syms, with eighty regulars of the independent companies, and a &s;up|ply of provi&s;ions, arrived on the 19th; but the enemy had marched off the day before in a great &s;now &s;torm. Our party
<PB N="96" REF="024800_0092_0FCD631BA40D37B0">however pur&s;ued them, and would have attacked their rear, if the Mohawks had not been aver&s;e to it. When the French reached the north branch of Hud&s;on's river, luckily a cake of ice &s;erved them to cro&s;s over it, the river being open both above and below. The fro&s;t was now extremely &s;evere, and the Mohawks fearful of an engagement; upon which Schuy|ler, who had retaken about fifty Indian captives, de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit on the 20th of February; four of his men and as many Indians being killed, and twelve wounded. Our In|dians, at this time, were &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions, that they fed upon the dead bodies of the French; and the ene|my, in their turn, were reduced, before they got home, to eat up their &s;hoes. The French in this enterpri&s;e lo&s;t eighty men, and had above thirty wounded.</P>
<P>Fletcher's extraordinary di&s;patch up to Albany, upon the fir&s;t news of this de&s;cent, gained the e&s;teem both of the public and our Indian allies.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s reached New-York on the 12th of February, at ten o'clock in the night, and in le&s;s than two days, the governor embarked with three hundred volunteers. The river, which was heretofore very uncommon at that &s;ea&s;on, was open<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The climate of late years is much altered, and this day (February 14, 1756) three hundred recruits &s;ailed from New-York for the army under the command of general Shirley, now quartered at Albany; and la&s;t year, a &s;loop went up the river a month earlier.</NOTE>. Fletcher landed at Albany, and arrived at Schenectady, the 17th of the month, which is about one hundred and &s;ixty miles from New-York: but he was &s;till too late to be of any other u&s;e than to &s;trengthen the anci|ent alliance. The Indians, in commendation of his activity on the occa&s;ion, gave him the name of Cayenguirago, or, the great &s;wift arrow.</P>
<P>Fletcher returned to New-York, and, in March, met the a&s;&s;embly, who were &s;o well plea&s;ed with his late vigilance, that be&s;ides giving him the thanks of the hou&s;e, they rai&s;ed 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for a year's pay of three hundred volunteers, and their officers, for the defence of the frontiers.</P>
<P>As the greate&s;t part of this province con&s;i&s;ted of Dutch in|habitants, all our governors, as well in the duke's time, as after the revolution, thought it good policy to encourage Engli&s;h preachers and &s;choolma&s;ters in the colony. No man could be more bent upon &s;uch a project than Fletcher, a bi|got to the e&s;pi&s;copal form of church government. He, ac|cordingly, recommended this matter to the a&s;&s;embly, on his
<PB N="97" REF="024800_0093_0FCD631CDC6B6400">fir&s;t arrival, as well as at their pre&s;ent meeting. The hou&s;e, from their attachment to the Dutch language, and the mo|del of the church of Holland, &s;ecured by one of the arti|cles of &s;urrender, were entirely di&s;inclined to the &s;cheme, which occa&s;ioned a warm rebuke from the governor, in his &s;peech at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, in the&s;e words; "gentle|men, the fir&s;t thing that I did recommend to you, at our la&s;t meeting, was to provide for a mini&s;try, and nothing is done in it. There are none of you, but what are big with the privileges of Engli&s;hment and magna charta, which is your right; and the &s;ame law doth provide for the religion of the church of England, again&s;t &s;abbath-breaking, and all other profanity. But as you have made it la&s;t, and po&s;t|poned it this &s;e&s;&s;ion, I hope you will begin with it the next meeting, and do &s;omewhat toward it effectually."</P>
<P>The news of the arrival of the recruits and ammunition at Canada, the late lo&s;s of the Mohawks, and the unfulfill|ed promi&s;es of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, made from time to time, by the Engli&s;h, together with the ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitations of Milet, the je&s;uit, all con&s;pired to induce the Oneydoes to &s;ue for a peace with the French. To prevent &s;o important an event, Fletcher met the five nations at Albany, in July 1693, with a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent of knives, hatchets, clothing, and ammunition, which had been &s;ent over, by the crown, for that purpo&s;e. The Indians con&s;ented to a renewal of the ancient league, and expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude, for the king's donation, with &s;ingular force. "Brother Cayenguirago, we roll and wallow in joy, by rea&s;on of the great favour the great king and queen have done us, in &s;ending us arms and ammunition at a time when we are in the greate&s;t need of them; and becau&s;e there is &s;uch unity among the bre|thren." Colonel Fletcher pre&s;&s;ed their delivering up to him Milet, the old prie&s;t, which they promi&s;ed, but never per|formed. On the contrary, he had influence enough to per|&s;uade all, but the Mohawks, to treat about the peace at Onondaga, though the governor exerted him&s;elf to prevent it.</P>
<P>Soon after this interview, Fletcher returned to New-York; and, in September, met a new a&s;&s;embly, of which James Graham was cho&s;en &s;peaker. The governor laboured, at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, to procure the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mini&s;try throughout the colony, a revenue to his maje&s;ty for life, the repairing the fort in New-York, and the erection of a chapel. That part of his &s;peech, relating to the mini&s;try, was in the&s;e words: "I recommended to the former a&s;&s;em|bly, the &s;ettling of an able mini&s;try, that the wor&s;hip of God may be ob&s;erved among us; for I find that great and fir&s;t
<PB N="98" REF="024800_0094_0FCD631E50F5E370">duty very much neglected. Let us not forget that there is a God, that made us, who will protect us, if we &s;erve him. This has been always the fir&s;t thing I have recommended, yet the la&s;t in your con&s;ideration. I hope you are all &s;atisfi|ed of the great nece&s;&s;ity and duty, that lies upon you to do this, as you expect his ble&s;&s;ing upon your labours." The zeal with which this affair was recommended, induced the hou&s;e, on the 12th of September, to appoint a committee of eight members, to agree upon a &s;cheme for &s;ettling a mini&s;try, in each re&s;pective precinct, throughout the pro|vince. This committee made a report the next day; but it was recommitted till the afternoon, and then deferred to the next morning. Several debates ari&s;ing about the report, in the hou&s;e, it was again "recommitted for farther con&s;idera|tion." On the 15th of September, it was approved, the e&s;|tabli&s;hment being then limited to &s;everal pari&s;hes in four countries, and a bill ordered to be brought in accordingly; which the &s;peaker (who, on the 18th of September, was appointed to draw all their bills) produced on the 19th. It was read twice on the &s;ame day, and then referred to a com|mittee of the whole hou&s;e. The third reading was on the 21&s;t of September, when the bill pa&s;&s;ed, and was &s;ent up to the governor and council, who immediately returned it with an amendment, to ve&s;t his excellency with an epi&s;co|pal power of inducting every incumbent, adding to that part of the bill near the end, which gave the right of the pre&s;enta|tion to the people, the&s;e words "and pre&s;ented to the go|vernor, to be approved and collated." The hou&s;e declined their con&s;ent to the addition, and immediately returned the bill, praying, "that it may pa&s;s without the amend|ment, having, in the drawing of the bill, had a due re|gard to that pious intent of &s;ettling a mini&s;try, for the be|nefit of the people." Fletcher was &s;o exa&s;perated with their refu&s;al, that he no &s;ooner received the an&s;wer of the hou&s;e, than he convened them before him, and in an angry &s;peech broke up the &s;e&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall lay that part of it, relating to this bill, before the reader, becau&s;e it is characteri&s;tic of the man.</P>

<P>There is al&s;o a bill for &s;ettling a mini&s;try in this city, and &s;ome other countries of the government. In that very thing you have &s;hown a great deal of &s;tiffne&s;s. You take up|on you, as if you were dictators. I &s;ent down to you an amendment of three or four words in that bill, which, though very immaterial, yet was po&s;itively denied. I mu&s;t tell you, it &s;eems very unmannerly. There never was an amendment yet de&s;ired by the council board, but what was
<PB N="99" REF="024800_0095_0FCD631FED726A28">rejected. It is the &s;ign of a &s;tubborn ill temper, and this have al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, I mu&s;t take leave to tell you, if you &s;eem to under&s;tand by the&s;e words, that none can &s;erve without your collation or e&s;tabli&s;hment, you are far mi&s;|taken. For I have the power of collating or &s;u&s;pending any mini&s;ter, in my government, by their maje&s;ties' letters pa|tent; and whil&s;t I &s;tay in the government, I will take care, that neither here&s;y, &s;edition, &s;chi&s;m, or rebellion, be preached among you, nor vice and profanity encouraged. It is my endeavour, to lead a virtuous and pious life among&s;t you, and to give a good example: I wi&s;h you all to do the &s;ame. You ought to con&s;ider, that you have but a third &s;hare in the legi&s;lative power of the government; and ought not to take all upon you, nor be &s;o peremptory. You ought to let the council have a &s;hare. They are in the nature of the hou&s;e of lords, or upper hou&s;e; but you &s;eem to take the whole power in your hands, and &s;et up for every thing. You have &s;et a long time, to little purpo&s;e, and have been a great charge to the country. Ten &s;hillings a day is a large allowance, and you punctually exact it. You have been always forward enough to pull down the fees of other mini&s;ters in the government. Why did you not think it expedient to correct your own, to a more moderate allow|ance?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall &s;ay no more, at pre&s;ent, but that you do withdraw to your private affairs in the country. I do prorogue you to the tenth of January next, and you are hereby prorogued to the tenth day of January next en&s;u|ing.</P>

<P>The violence of this man's temper is very evident in all his &s;peeches and me&s;&s;ages to the a&s;&s;embly; and it can only be attributed to the ignorance of the times, that the members of that hou&s;e, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting their equality, peaceably put up with his rudene&s;s. Certainly they de&s;erved better u&s;age at his hands. For the revenue, e&s;tabli&s;hed the la&s;t year, was, at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, continued five years longer than was originally intended. This was rendering the governor for a time independent of the people. For, at that day, the a&s;|&s;embly had no trea&s;ure; but the amount of all taxes went of cour&s;e into the hands of the receiver-general, who was appointed by the crown. Out of this fund, monies were only i&s;&s;uable by the governor's warrant; &s;o that every officer in the government, from mr. Blaithwait, who drew annually five per cent, out of the revenue, as auditor-general, down to the meane&s;t &s;ervant of the public, became dependent, &s;ole|ly, of the governor. And hence we find the hou&s;e, at the clo&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="024800_0096_0FCD63CA0CCBECB8">of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, humbly addre&s;&s;ing his excellency, for the trifling wages of their own clerk. Fletche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was, notwith|&s;tanding, &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed with them, that, &s;oon after the prorogation, he di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The members of the new a&s;&s;embly met, according to the writ of &s;ummons, in March 1694, and cho&s;e colonel Peir&s;on, for their &s;peaker, mr. Graham being left out at the election for the city. The &s;hortne&s;s of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, which continued only to the latter end of the month, was owing to the di&s;|agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s the hou&s;e began upon, of examining the &s;tate of the public accounts, and in particular the mu&s;ter rolls of the volunteers, in the pay of the province. They, however, re&s;umed it again in September, and formally en|tered their di&s;&s;atisfaction, with the receiver-general's ac|counts. The governor, at the &s;ame time, blew up the coals of contention, by a demand of additional pay, for the king's &s;oldiers, then ju&s;t arrived, and new &s;upplies for detachments in defence of the frontiers. He at la&s;t prorogued them, af|ter obtaining an act for &s;upporting one hundred men upon the borders. The &s;ame di&s;putes revived again in the &s;pring 1695; and proceeded to &s;uch lengths, that the a&s;&s;embly a&s;k|ed the governor's leave to print their minutes, that they might appeal to the public. It was at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, on the 12th of April 1695, that upon a petition of five church wardens and ve&s;trymen of the city of New-York, the hou&s;e declared it to be their opinion, "That the ve&s;trymen and church|wardens have power to call a di&s;&s;enting prote&s;tant min&s;ter, and that he is to be paid and maintained as the act directs." The intent of this petition was to refute an opinion, which prevailed, that the late mini&s;try act was made for the &s;ole benefit of epi&s;copal clergymen.</P>
<P>The quiet, undi&s;turbed &s;tate of the frontiers, while the French were endeavouring to make a peace with the five na|tions, and the complaints of many of the volunteers, who had not received their pay, very much conduced to the back|wardne&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly, in an&s;wering Fletcher's perpetual demands of money. But when the Indians refu&s;ed to com|ply with the terms of peace demanded by the French go|vernor, which were to &s;uffer him to rebuild the fort at Ca|daraqui, and to include the Indian allies, the war broke out afre&s;h, and the a&s;&s;embly were obliged to augment both their detachments and &s;upplies. The count Frontenac now le|velled his wrath, principally again&s;t the Mohawks, who were more attached, than any other of the five nations, to our intere&s;t: but as his intentions had taken air, he pru|dendy changed his mea&s;ures, and &s;ent a party of three hun|dred men, to the i&s;thmus at Niagara, to &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e of
<PB N="101" REF="024800_0097_0FCD638613593388">the five nations, that might be hunting there. Among a few that were met with, &s;ome were killed, and others taken pri&s;oners, and afterwards burnt at Montreal. Our Indians imitated the count's example, and burnt ten Dewagunga captives.</P>
<P>Colonel Fletcher and his a&s;&s;embly having come to an open rupture in the &s;pring, he called another in June, of which James Graham was cho&s;en &s;peaker. The count Frontenac was then repairing the old fort at Cada<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aqui; and the intel|ligence of this, and the king's a&s;&s;ignment of the quotas of the &s;everal colonies, for an united force<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;uch an union appeared to be nece&s;&s;ary &s;o long ago, it is very &s;urpri&s;ing that no effectual &s;cheme for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pur|po&s;e has hitherto been carried into full execution.

<P>As a number of forces were now arrived the a&s;&s;embly were in hopes, the province would be relieved from rai&s;ing any more men for the defence of the frontiers; and, to obtain this favour of the governor, ordered &pound; 1000. to be levied, one half to be pre&s;ented to him, and the re&s;t he had leave to di&s;tribute among the Engli&s;h officers and &s;oldiers. A bill for this purpo&s;e was drawn; but though his excellency thank|ed them for their favourable intention, he thought it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his honour to con&s;ent to it. After pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal laws, the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up in perfect harmony, the governor, in his great grace, recommending it to the hou&s;e, to appoint a com|mittee to examine the public accounts again&s;t the next &s;e&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="024800_0098_0FCD57FC5DE555E8">
In September, Fletcher went up to Albany, with very con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to the Indians; whom he blamed for &s;uffering the French to rebuild the fort at Cadaraqui, or Fron|tenac, which commands the entrance from Canada, into the great lake Ontario.</P>
<P>While the&s;e works were carrying on, the Dionandadies, who were then poorly &s;upplied by the French, made over|tures of a peace with the five nations, which the latter readi|ly embraced, becau&s;e it was owing to their fears of the&s;e In|dians, who lived near the lake Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac, that they ne|ver dared to march with their whole &s;trength again&s;t Ca|nada. The French commandant was fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of preventing this alliance. The civilities of the Dionandadies to the pri&s;oners, by whom the treaty, to pre|vent a di&s;covery, was negociated, gave the officer the fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of it. One of the&s;e wretches had the unhappine&s;s to fall into the hands of the French, who put him to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments, that all future intercour&s;e with the Dionandadies might be cut off. Dr. Colden, in ju&s;t re|&s;entment for this inhuman barbarity, has publi&s;hed the whole proce&s;s from la Potherie's hi&s;tory of North America, and it is this:</P>
<P>"The pri&s;oner being fir&s;t made fa&s;t to a &s;take, &s;o as to have room to move round it; a Frenchman began the hor|rid tragedy, by broiling the fle&s;h of the pri&s;oner's legs, from his toes to his knees, with the red-hot barrel of a gun. His example was followed by an Utawawa, who, being de&s;i|rous to out do the French in their refined cruelty, &s;plit a fur|row from the pri&s;oner's &s;houlder to his garter, and filling it with gun-powder, &s;et fire to it. This gave him exqui&s;ite pain, and rai&s;ed exce&s;&s;ive laughter in his tormentors. When they found his throat &s;o much parched, that he was no longer able to gratify their ears with his howling, they gave him water, to enable him to continue their plea&s;ure longer. But at la&s;t, his &s;trength failing, an Utawawa fleated off his &s;calp, and threw burning hot coals on his &s;cull. Then they untied him, and bid him run for his life. He began to run, tumbling like a drunken man. They &s;hut up the way to the ea&s;t, and made him run we&s;tward, the country, as they think, of departed mi&s;erable fouls. He had &s;till force left to throw &s;tones, till they put an end to his mi&s;ery by knocking him on the head. After this every one cut a &s;lice from his body, to conclude the tragedy with a fea&s;t."</P>
<P>From the time colonel Fletcher received his in&s;truction, re&s;pecting the quotas of the&s;e colonies, for the defence of the frontiers, he repeatedly, but in vain, urged their com|pliance with the king's direction: he then carried his com|plaints
<PB N="103" REF="024800_0099_0FCD63214D2B1418">again&s;t them home to his maje&s;ty, but all his ap|plications were defeated by the agents of tho&s;e colonies, who re&s;ided in England. As &s;oon, therefore, as he had laid this matter before the a&s;&s;embly, in autumn 1695, the hou&s;e appointed William Nicol, to go home in the quality of an agent for this province, for which they allowed him &pound; 1000. But his &s;olicitations proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the in&s;truc|tion, relating to the&s;e quotas, which is &s;till continued, re|mains unnoticed to this day. Fletcher maintained a good corre&s;pondence with the a&s;&s;embly, through the re&s;t of his admini&s;tration: and nothing appears, upon their journals, worth the reader's attention.</P>
<P>The French never had a governor, in Canada, &s;o vigilant and active as the count de Frontenac. He had no &s;ooner re|paired the old fort, called by his name, than he formed a de&s;ign of invading the country of the five nations with a great army. For this purpo&s;e, in 1696, he convened at Montreal, all the regulars, as well as militia, under his command; the Owenagungas, Quatoghies of Loretto, Adi|rondacks, Sokakies, Nipiciriniens, the pro&s;elyted praying Indians of the five nations, and a few Utawawas. In&s;tead of waggons and hor&s;es, which are u&s;ele&s;s in &s;uch a country, as he had to march through, the army was conveyed, through rivers and lakes, in light barks, which are porta|ble, whenever the rapidity of the &s;tream and the cro&s;&s;ing an i&s;thmus rendered it nece&s;&s;ary. The count left la Chine, at the &s;outh end of the i&s;land of Montreal, on the 7th of July. Two battalions of regulars, under the command of le Chevalier de Callieres, headed by a number of Indians, led the van, with two &s;mall pieces of cannon, the mortars, grenadoes, and ammunition. After them followed the pro|vi&s;ions; then the main body, with the count's hou&s;ehold, a con&s;iderable number of volunteers, and the engi|neer; and four battalions of the militia commanded by mon&s;ieur de Ramezai, governor of Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>Two battalions of regulars and a few Indians, under the chevalier de Vaudrueil, brought up the rear. Before the army went a parcel of &s;couts, to de&s;cry the tracks and am|bu&s;cades of the enemy. After twelve days march, they ar|rived at Cadaraqui, about one hundred and eighty miles from Montreal, and then cro&s;&s;ed the lake to O&s;wego. Fifty men marched on each &s;ide of the Onondaga river, which is narrow and rapid. When they entered the little lake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Onondaga lake, noted for a good &s;alt pit at the &s;outh ea&s;t end; which, as it may be very advantageous to the garri&s;on at O&s;wego, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oped the government will never grant to any private company.</NOTE>, the

As &s;oon as the count heard of this, he marched to their huts in order of battle; being him&s;elf carried in an elbow chair, behind the artillery. With this mighty apparatus he entered it, and the de&s;truc|tion of a little Indian corn was the great acqui&s;ition. A brave &s;achem, then about a hundred years old, was the only per&s;on who tarried in the ca&s;tle to &s;alute the old ge|neral. The French Indians put him to torment, which he endured with a&s;toni&s;hing pre&s;ence of mind. To one who &s;tabbed him with a knife, "you had better," &s;ays he," "make me die by fire, that the&s;e French dogs may learn how to &s;uffer like men: you Indians, their allies, you dogs of dogs, think of me when you are in the like condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Never perhaps (&s;ays Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oix) was a man treated with more cruelty, nor did any ever bear it with &s;uperior magnanimity and re&s;olution."</NOTE>." This &s;achem was the only man, of all the Onondagas, that was killed; and had not thirty-five Oneydoes, who waited to receive Vaud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ueil at their ca&s;tles, been afterwards ba&s;ely carried into captivity, the count would have returned with|out the lea&s;t mark of triumph. As &s;oon as he began his re|treat, the Onondagas followed, and annoyed his army by cutting off &s;everal batteaus.</P>
<P>This expen&s;ive enterpri&s;e, and the continual incur&s;ions of the five nations, on the country near Montreal, again &s;pread a famine through all Canada. The count, however, kept up his &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its to the la&s;t; and &s;ent out &s;calping parties, who infe&s;ted Albany, as our Indians did Montreal, till the treaty of peace, &s;igned at Ry&s;wick, in 1697.</P>
<P>Richard, earl of Bellamont, was appointed to &s;ucceed colonel Fletcher, in the year 1695; but did not receive his commi&s;&s;ion till the 18th of June, 1697: and as he delayed his voyage till after the peace of Ry&s;wick, which was &s;igned the 10th of September following, he was blown off our coa&s;t to Barbadoes, and did not arrive here before the 2d of April, 1698.</P>

During the late war, the &s;eas were extremely infe&s;ted with Engli&s;h pirates, &s;ome of whom &s;ailed out of New-York; and it was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that they had received too much countenance here, even from the government, du|ring Fletcher's admini&s;tration. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is lord&s;hip's promotion to the chief command of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's bay and New-Hamp&s;hire, as well as this province, was owing partly to his rank, but principally to the affair of the pitates; and the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, to which the charge of three colonies would nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e him, induced the earl to bring over with him John Nanfan, his kin&s;man, in the qua|lity of our lieutenant-governor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His commi&s;&s;ion was dated the 1&s;t of July, 1697.</NOTE>. When lord Bellamont was appointed to the government of the&s;e provinces, the king did him the honour to &s;ay "that he thought him a man of re&s;olution and integrity, and with the&s;e qualities more likely than any other he could think of, to put a &s;top to the growth of piracy."</P>
<P>Before the earl &s;et out for America, he became acquainted with Robert Living&s;ton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman was a &s;on of mr.

He was a clergyman di&s;tingui&s;hed by his zeal and indu&s;try; and, for his oppo&s;ition to epi&s;co|pacy, became &s;o obnoxious, after the re&s;toration, to the En|gli&s;h court, that he left Scotland, and took the pa&s;toral charge of an Engli&s;h pre&s;byterian church in Rotterdam. His de&s;cendants are very numerous in this province, and the fa|mily in the fir&s;t rank for their wealth, morals, and educa|tion.

The earl took occa&s;ion, in one of his conferences with mr.

The earl laid the propo&s;al before the king, who con|&s;ulted the admiralty upon that &s;ubject: but this project drop|ped, through the uncertainty of the adventure, and the French war, which gave full employment to all the &s;hips in
<PB N="106" REF="024800_0102_0FCD63292D6CD478">the navy. Mr. Living&s;ton then propo&s;ed a private adventure again&s;t the pirates, offering to be concerned with Kid, a fifth part in the &s;hip and charges, and to be bound for Kid's faithful execution of the commi&s;&s;ion. The king then ap|proved of the de&s;ign, and re&s;erved a tenth &s;hare, to &s;how that he was concerned in the enterpri&s;e&punc; Lord chancellor Somers, the duke of Shrew&s;bury, the earls of Romu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y and Oxford, &s;ir Edmond Harri&s;on and others, joined in the &s;cheme, agreeing to the expen&s;e of 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> But the manage|ment of the whole affair was left to lord Bellamont, who gave orders to Kid to pur&s;ue his commi&s;&s;ion, which was in common form. Kid &s;ailed, from Plymouth, for New-York, in April, 1696; and afterwards turned pirate, burnt his &s;hip, and came to Bo&s;ton, where the earl apprehended him. His lord&s;hip wrote to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, de&s;iring that Kid might be &s;ent for. The Roche&s;ter man of war was di&s;patch|ed upon this &s;ervice; but being driven back, a general &s;u&s;pi|cion prevailed in England, that all was collu&s;ion between the mini&s;try and the adventurers, who, it was thought, were unwilling Kid &s;hould be brought home, le&s;t he might di&s;|cover that the chancellor, the duke, and others, were con|federates in the piracy. The matter even proceeded to &s;uch lengths, that a motion was made, in the hou&s;e of commons, that all who were concerned in the adventure, might be turned out of their employments; but it was rejected by a great majority.</P>
<P>The tory party, who excited the&s;e clamours, though they lo&s;t their motion in the hou&s;e, afterwards impeached &s;e|veral whig lords; and, among other articles, charged them with being concerned in Kid's piracy.

<P>After the earl had di&s;patched captain John Schuyler, and Dellius, the Dutch mini&s;ter of Albany, to Canada, with the account of the peace, and to &s;olicit a mutual exchange of
<PB N="107" REF="024800_0103_0FCD632A53A3C178">pri&s;oners; he laid before the council the letters from &s;ecre|tary Vernon and the Ea&s;t-India company, relating to the pirates; informing that board, that he had an affidavit, that Fletcher had permitted them to land their &s;poils in this province, and that mr. Nic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> bargained for their protec|tions, and received for his &s;ervices 800 Spani&s;h dollars. Nicoll confe&s;&s;ed the receipt of the money for protec|tions, but &s;aid it was in virtue of a late act of a&s;&s;embly, al|lowing privateers on their giving &s;ecurity; but he denied the receipt of any money from known pirates. One Weaver was admitted, at this time, into the council-chamber, and acted in the quality of king's council, and in an&s;wer to mr. Nicoll, denied that there was any &s;uch act of a&s;&s;embly as he mentioned. After con&s;idering the whole matter, the council advi&s;ed his excellency to &s;end Fletcher home, but to try Nicoll here, becau&s;e his e&s;tate would not bear the expen&s;e of a trial in England. Their advice was never carried into execution, which was probably owing to a want of evidence again&s;t the parties accu&s;ed. It is neverthele&s;s certain, that the pirates were frequently in the &s;ound, and &s;upplied with provi&s;ions by the inhabitants of Long I&s;land, who, for many years afterwards, were &s;o infatuated with a notion, that the pirates buried great quantities of money along the coa&s;t, that there is &s;carce a point of land, or an i&s;land without the marks of their <HI>auri &s;acra fames.</HI> Some credulous people have ruined them&s;elves by the&s;e re&s;earches, and propagated a thou&s;and idie fables current to this day, among our country farmers.</P>
<P>As Fletcher, through the whole of his admini&s;tration, had been entirely influenced by the enemies of Lei&s;ler; no|thing could be more agreeable to the numerous adherents of that unhappy man, than the earl's di&s;affection to the late governor. It was for this rea&s;on, they immediately devoted them&s;elves to his lord&s;hip, as the head of their party.</P>
<P>The majority of the members of the council were Fletch|er's friends; and there needed nothing more to render them obnoxious to his lord&s;hip. Lei&s;ler's advocates, at the &s;ame time, mortally hated them; not only becau&s;e they had im|brued their hands in the blood of the principal men of their party, but al&s;o becau&s;e they had engro&s;&s;ed the &s;ole confi|dence of the late governor, and brought down his re&s;ent|ment upon them. Hence, at the commencement of the earl's admini&s;tration, the members of the council had every thing to fear; while the party they had depre&s;&s;ed, be|gan once again to erect its head under the &s;miles of a gover|nor, who was fond of their aid, as they were &s;olicitous to conciliate his favour. Had the earl countenanced the ene|mies, as well as the friends of Lei&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, which he might have done, his admini&s;tration would doubtle&s;s have been ea&s;ier
<PB N="108" REF="024800_0104_0FCD632BCE4B4D40">to him&s;elf and advantageous to the province. But his in|flexible aver&s;ion to Fletcher prevented his acting with that moderation, which was nece&s;&s;ary to enable him to govern both parties. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his temper appeared very early, on his &s;u&s;pending mr. Nicoll from the board of council, and obliging him to enter into a recognizance in 2000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to an&s;wer fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his conduct relating to the protections. But his &s;peech to the new a&s;&s;embly, convened on the 18th of May, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the fulle&s;t evidence of his abhorrence of the late ad|mini&s;tration. Philip French was cho&s;en &s;peaker, and waited upon his excellency with the hou&s;e, when his lord&s;hip &s;poke to them in the following manner:</P>
<P>"I cannot but ob&s;erve to you, what a legacy my prede|ce&s;&s;or has left me, and what difficulties to &s;truggle with; a divided people, an empty pur&s;e, a few mi&s;erable, naked, half-&s;tarved &s;oldiers, not half the number the king allowed pay for: the fortifications and even the governor's hou&s;e very much out of repair, and, in a word, the whole go|vernment out of frame. It hath been repre&s;ented to the go|vernment in England, that this province has been a noted receptacle of pirates, and the trade of it under no re&s;tricti|on, but the acts of trade violated by the neglect and con|nivance of tho&s;e, who&s;e duty it was to have prevented it."</P>
<P>After this introduction, he puts them in mind that the revenue was near expiring. "It would be hard, &s;ays he, if I that come among you with an hone&s;t mind, and a re&s;o|lution to be ju&s;t to your intere&s;t, &s;hould meet with greater difficulties, in the di&s;charge of his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, than tho&s;e that have gone before me. I will take care there &s;hall be no mi&s;application of the public money. I will pocket none of it my&s;elf, nor &s;hall there be any embezzlement by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers; but exact accounts &s;hall be given you, when, and as often as you &s;hall require."</P>
<P>It was cu&s;tomary with Fletcher, to be pre&s;ent in the field, to influence elections; and as the a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted, at this time, of but nineteen members, they were too ea&s;i|ly influenced to &s;erve the private ends of a faction. For that rea&s;on, his lord&s;hip was warm in a &s;cheme of increa&s;ing their number, at pre&s;ent, to thirty, and &s;o, in proportion, as the colony became more populous; and hence we find the following clau&s;e in his &s;peech. "You cannot but know, what abu&s;es have been formerly in elections of members, to &s;erve in the general a&s;&s;embly, which tends to the &s;ubver&s;ion of your liberties. I do therefore recommend the making of a law to provide again&s;t it."</P>
<P>The hou&s;e, though unanimous in a hearty addre&s;s of thanks to the governor for his &s;peech, could &s;carce agree
<PB N="109" REF="024800_0105_0FCD632D5331D568">upon any thing el&s;e. It was not till the beginning of June, before they had fini&s;hed the controver&s;ies relating to the late turbulent elections; and even then &s;ix members &s;eceded from the hou&s;e, which obliged his excellency to di&s;&s;olve the a&s;&s;embly on the 14th of June, 1693. About the &s;ame time, the governor di&s;mi&s;&s;ed two of the council; Pinhorne, for di&s;re&s;pectful words of the king, and Brook, the receiver-general, who was al&s;o turned out of that office, as well as removed from his place on the bench.</P>
<P>In July, the di&s;putes with the French, concerning the ex|changing of pri&s;oners, obliged his excellency to go up to Albany. When the earl &s;ent the account of the conclu&s;ion of the peace to the governor of Canada, all the French pri|&s;oners, in our cu&s;tody, were re&s;tored, and as to tho&s;e among the Indians, he promi&s;ed to order them to be &s;afely e&s;cort|ed to Montreal. His lord&s;hip then added, "I doubt not, &s;ir, that you; on your part, will al&s;o i&s;&s;ue an order to re|lieve the &s;ubjects of the king, captivated during the war, whether chri&s;tians or Indians."</P>
<P>The count, fearful of being drawn into an implicit ac|knowledgment, that the five nations were &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h crown, demanded the French pri&s;oners, among the Indians, to be brought to Montreal; threatening, at the &s;ame time, to continue the war again&s;t the confederates, if they did not comply with his reque&s;t. After the earl's in|terview with them, he wrote a &s;econd letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix has publi&s;hed both the&s;e letters, at large, together with count Frontenac's an&s;wer. I have had no op|portunity of enquiring into the je&s;uit's integrity, in the&s;e tran&s;cripts, being unable to find his lord&s;hip's letters in the &s;ecretary's office.</NOTE> to the count, informing him that they had importunately begged to con|tinue under the protection of the Engli&s;h crown, profe&s;&s;ing an inviolable &s;ubjection and fidelity to his maje&s;ty; and that the five nations were always con&s;idered as &s;ubjects, which, &s;ays his lord&s;hip, "can be manife&s;ted to all the world by authentic and &s;olid proofs." His lord&s;hip added, that he would not &s;uffer them to be in&s;ulted, and threatened to exe|cute the laws of England upon the mi&s;&s;ionaries, if they con|tinued any longer in the five cantons. A re&s;olute &s;pirit runs through the whole letter, which concludes in the&s;e words: "if it is nece&s;&s;ary, I will arm every man in the provinces, under my government, to oppo&s;e you; and redre&s;s the in|jury that you may perpetrate again&s;t our Indians." The
<PB N="110" REF="024800_0106_0FCD633233B8F398">count, in his an&s;wer, propo&s;ed to refer the di&s;pute to the commi&s;&s;aries, to be appointed according to the treaty of Ry&s;wick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The count mi&s;under&s;tood the treaty. No provi&s;ion was made by it for commi&s;&s;aries to &s;ettle the limits between the Engli&s;h and French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but only to examine and de|termine the controverted rights and preten&s;ions to Hud&s;on's Bay.</NOTE> but the earl continued the claim, in&s;i&s;ting that the French pri&s;oners &s;hould be delivered up at Albany.</P>
<P>The French count dying while this matter was contro|verted, mon&s;ieur de Callieres, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ent amba&s;&s;a|dors, the next year, to Onondaga, there to regulate the exchange of pri&s;oners, which was accompli&s;hed without the earl's con&s;ent; and thus the important point, in di&s;|pute, remained un&s;ettled. The je&s;uit Bruyas, who was up|on this emba&s;&s;age, offered to live at Onondaga; but the Indians ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed his belt, &s;aying that Corlear, or the gover|nor of New-York, had already offered them mini&s;ters for their in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Great alterations were made in council, at his excellency is return from Albany. Bayard, Mienvielle, Willet, Townly, and Lawrence, were all &s;u&s;pended on the 28th of Septem|ber; and colonel Abraham Depey&s;ter, Robert Living&s;ton, and Samuel Staats, called to that board. The next day, Fre|derick Philip&s;e re&s;igned his &s;eat, and Robert Walters was &s;worn in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>The new a&s;&s;embly, of which James Graham was cho&s;en &s;peaker, met in the &s;pring. His excellency &s;poke to them on the 21&s;t of March, 1699.</P>
<P>As the late a&s;&s;embly was principally compo&s;ed of Anti-Lei&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erians, &s;o this con&s;i&s;ted, almo&s;t entirely, of the oppo&s;ite party. The elections were attended with great outrage and tumult, and many applications made, relating to the re|turns; but as Abraham Governeur, who had been &s;ecretary to Lei&s;ler, got returned for Orange county, and was very active in the hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Governeur married Mi&s;borne's widow.</NOTE>, all the petitions were rejected with|out ceremony.</P>
<P>Among the principal acts, pa&s;&s;ed at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, there was one for indemnifying tho&s;e who were excepted out of the general pardon in 1691; another again&s;t pirates; one for the &s;ettlement of Milborne's e&s;tate; and another to rai&s;e fifteen hundred pounds, as a pre&s;ent to his lord&s;hip, and five hundred pounds for the lieutenant-governor, his
<PB N="111" REF="024800_0107_0FCD632FF45166F0">kin&s;man. Be&s;ides which, the revenue was continued for &s;ix years longer. A nece&s;&s;ary law was al&s;o made for the regu|lation of elections, containing the &s;ub&s;tance of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes of 8 Hen. VI. chap. VII. and the 7 and 8 Will. III.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;embly took, al&s;o, into con&s;ideration &s;undry ex|travagant grants of land, which colonel Fletcher had made to &s;everal of his favourites. Among the&s;e, two grants to Delli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the Dutch mini&s;ter, and one to Nicholas Bayard, were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Dellius was one of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners for Indian affairs, and had fradulently obtained the Indian deeds, according to which the patents had been granted. One of the grants included all the lands within twelve miles on the ca&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river, and extend|ed twenty miles in length, from the north bounds of Sa|raghtoga. The &s;econd patent, which was granted to him in company with Pinhorne, Bancker, and others, contained all the lands, within two miles on each &s;ide of the Mohawks river, and along its banks to the extent of fifty miles, Bayard's grant was al&s;o for lands in that country, and very extravagant. Lord Bellamont, who ju&s;tly thought the&s;e great patents, with the trifling annual re&s;ervation of a few &s;kins, would impede the &s;ettlement of the country, as well as alienate the affections of our Indian allies, wifely pro|cured recommendatory in&s;tructions from the lords ju&s;tices, for vacating tho&s;e patents, which was now regularly ac|compli&s;hed by a law, and Dellius thereby &s;u&s;pended from his mini&s;terial function.</P>
<P>The earl having thus carried all his points at New-York, &s;et out for Bo&s;ton in June, where, after he had &s;et|tled his &s;alary, and apprehended the pirate Kidd, he re|turned here again in the fall.</P>
<P>The revenue being &s;ettled for &s;ix years, his lord&s;hip had no occa&s;ion to meet the a&s;&s;embly till the &s;ummer of the year 1700, and then indeed little el&s;e was done, than to pa&s;s a few laws. One for hanging every popi&s;h prie&s;t that came volun|tarily into the province, which was occa&s;ioned by the great number of French je&s;uits, who were continually practi&s;ing upon our Indians. By another, provi&s;ion was made for erect|ing a fort in the country of the Onondagas; but as this was repealed a few months after the king's providing for that purpo&s;e, &s;o the former continues, as it forever ought, in full force to this day.</P>
<P>The earl was a man of art and polite manners, and being a mortal enemy to the French, as well as a lover of liberty,

<P>The earl of Bellamont's death was the &s;ource of new troubles; for Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, being then ab&s;ent in Barbadoes, high di&s;putes aro&s;e among the coun|&s;ellors, concerning the exerci&s;e of the powers of govern|ment. Abraham de Pey&s;ter, Samuel Staats, Robert Walters, and Thomas Weaver, who &s;ided with the party that ad|hered to Lei&s;ler, in&s;i&s;ted that the government was devolved upon the council, who had a right to act by a majority of voices; but colonel Smith contended that all the powers of the late governor were devolved upon him, as pre&s;ident, he being the elde&s;t member of that board. Colonel Schuyler and Robert Living&s;ton, who did not arrive in town till the 21&s;t of March, joined mr. Smith, and refu&s;ed to appear at the council-board, till near the middle of April. The a&s;&s;em|bly, which was convened on the 2d of that month, were in equal perplexity; for they adjourned from day to day, waiting the i&s;&s;ue of this rupture. Both parties continuing inflexible, tho&s;e members, who oppo&s;ed colonel Smith, &s;ent down to the hou&s;e a repre&s;entation of the controver&s;y, a&s;&s;igning a number of rea&s;ons for the &s;itting of the a&s;&s;em|bly, which the hou&s;e took into their con&s;ideration, and on the 16th of April re&s;olved, that the execution of the earl's commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions, in the ab&s;ence of the lieute|nant-governor, was the right of the council by majority of voices, and not of any &s;ingle member of that board; and this was afterwards the opinion of the lords of trade. The di&s;putes, neverthele&s;s, continuing in the council, &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported by mr. Living&s;ton, the hou&s;e, on the 19th of April, thought proper to adjourn them&s;elves to the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in June.</P>
<P>In this interval, on the 19th of May, John Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, arrived, and &s;ettled the controver&s;y, by taking upon him&s;elf the &s;upreme command.</P>
<P>Upon mr. Nanfan's arrival, we had the agreeable news, that the king had given two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, for the defence of Albany and Schenectady, as well as five hundred pounds more for erecting a fort in the country of the Onondagas. And not long after an ordinance was i&s;&s;ued, agreeable to the &s;pecial direction of the lords of trade, for erecting a court of chancery, to &s;it the fir&s;t Thur&s;day in every month. By this ordinance the powers of the chan|celor
<PB N="113" REF="024800_0109_0FCD6334D0BC0AD8">were ve&s;ted in the governor and council, or any two of that board: commi&s;&s;ions were al&s;o granted, appointing ma&s;ters, clerks, and a regi&s;ter: &s;o that this court was com|pletely organized on the 2d of September, 1701.</P>
<P>Atwood, who was then chief ju&s;tice or the &s;upreme court, was now &s;worn of the council. Abraham de Pey&s;ter, and Robert Walters were his a&s;&s;i&s;tants on the bench; and the former was al&s;o made deputy auditor-general, under mr. Elaithwait. Samp&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">helton Broughton was the attorney-general, and came into that office when Atwood took his &s;eat on the bench, before the decea&s;e of lord Bel|lamont. Both the&s;e had their commi&s;&s;ions from England. The lieutenant-governor, and the major part of the board of council, together with the &s;everal officers above named, being &s;trongly in the intere&s;t of the Lei&s;lerian party, it was not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that mr. Nanfan di&s;&s;olved the late a&s;&s;embly on the 1&s;t of June la&s;t.</P>
<P>Great were the &s;truggles at the en&s;uing elections, which, however, generally prevailed in &s;avour of tho&s;e who joined Lei&s;ler at the revolution; and hence, when the new a&s;&s;em|bly met on the 19th of Augu&s;t 1701, Abraham Governeur was elected for their &s;peaker. Dutche&s;s was thought here|tofore incapable of bearing the charge of a repre&s;entation; but the people of that county, now animated by the heat of the times, &s;ent Jacob Rut&s;en and Adrian Garret&s;en to re|pre&s;ent them in a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Mr. Nanfan, in his &s;peech to the hou&s;e, informs them of the memorable grant made to the crown, on the 19th of July, by the five nations, of a va&s;t tract of land, to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of their &s;ubmitting to the French in ca&s;e of a war; and that his maje&s;ty had given out of his exchequer two thou&s;and five hundred pounds &s;terling, for forts, and eight hundred pounds to be laid out in pre&s;ents to the In|dians; and that he had al&s;o &s;ettled a &s;alary of three hun|dred pounds on a chief ju&s;tice, and one hundred and fifty pounds on the attorney-general, who were both now arrived here.</P>
<P>The fire of contention, which had lately appeared in the tumultuous elections, blazed out afre&s;h in the hou&s;e, Nicoll, the late coun&s;ellor, got him&s;elf elected for Suffolk, and was in hopes of being &s;eated in the chair: but Abraham Governeur was cho&s;en &s;peaker. Several members contended, that he, being an alien, was unqualified for that &s;tation. To this it was an&s;wered, that he was in the province in the year 1683, at the time of pa&s;&s;ing an act to naturalize all the free inhabitants, profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian religion; and that
<PB N="114" REF="024800_0110_0FCD6336F73719F0">for this rea&s;on, the &s;ame objection again&s;t him had benn-over-ruled at the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly. In return for this attack, Governeur di&s;puted Nicoll's right of &s;itting as a member of that hou&s;e; and &s;ucceeded in a re&s;olve, that he and mr. We&s;&s;els, who had been returned for Albany, were both un|qualified according to the late act, they being neither of them re&s;idents in the re&s;pective counties for which they were cito&s;en: This occa&s;ioned an imprudent &s;ece&s;&s;ion of &s;even members, who had joined the intere&s;t of mr. Nicoll; which gave their adver&s;aries an opportunity to expel them, and introduce others in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>Among the fir&s;t oppo&s;ers of captain Lei&s;ler, none was more con&s;iderable than mr. Living&s;ton. The mea&s;ures of the convention at Albany were very much directed by his advice; and he was peculiarly obnoxious to his adver&s;aries, becau&s;e he was a man of &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution, two qualifi|cations rarely to be found united in one per&s;on at that day. Mr. Living&s;ton's intimacy with the late earl, had till this time, been his defence, again&s;t the rage of the party which he had formerly oppo&s;ed: but as that lord was now dead, and mr. Living&s;ton's conduct in council, in favour of colonel Smith, had given fre&s;h provocation to his enemies, they were fully bent upon his de&s;truction. It was in execution of this &s;cheme, that as &s;oon as the di&s;puted elections were over, the hou&s;e proceeded to examine the &s;tate of the pub|lic accounts, which they partly began at the late a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The pretence was, that he refu&s;ed to account for the public monies, he had formerly received out of the exci&s;e; upon which, a committee of both hou&s;es advi&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ing a bill to confi&s;cate his e&s;tate, unle&s;s he agreed to account by a certain day. But in&s;tead of this, an act was afterwards pa&s;&s;ed to oblige him to account for a &s;um amounting to near eighteen thou&s;and pounds. While this matter was tran&s;acting, a new complaint was forged, and he was &s;um|moned before another committee of both hou&s;es, relating to his procuring the five nations to &s;ignify their de&s;ire that he &s;hould be &s;ent home to &s;olicit their affairs. The crimi|nality of this charge can be &s;een only through the partial optics, with which his enemies then &s;canned his behaviour. Be&s;ides, there was no evidence to &s;upport it, and therefore the committee required him to purge him&s;elf by his own oath. Mr. Living&s;ton, who was better acquainted with Engli&s;h law and liberty, than to countenance a practice &s;o odious, rejected the in&s;olent demand with di&s;dain; upon which the hou&s;e, by advice of the committee, addre&s;&s;ed the lieutenant-governor, to pray his maje&s;ty to remove
<PB N="115" REF="024800_0111_0FCD6337E85BF090">him from his office of &s;ecretary of Indian affairs, and that the governor, in the mean time, would &s;u&s;pend him from the exerci&s;e of his commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Living&s;ton's rea&s;on for not accounting was truly unan&s;werable; his books and vouchers were taken into the hands of the government, and detained from him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was at this favourable conjuncture, that Jacob Lei&s;ler's petition to the king, and his maje&s;ty's letter to the late ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l of Bellamont, were laid before the a&s;&s;embly. Lei&s;ter, di&s;|plea&s;ed with the report of the lords of trade, that his fa|ther and his brother Milborne had &s;uffered according to law, laid his ca&s;e before the parliament, and obtained an act to rever&s;e the attainder. After which, he applied to the king, complaining that his father had di&s;bur&s;ed about four thou|&s;and pounds, in purcha&s;ing arms, and forwarding the re|volution; in con&s;equence of which he procured the follow|ing letter to lord Bellamont, dated at Whitehall the 6th of February 1699/1700.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE king being moved upon the petition of mr. Ja|cob Lei&s;ler, and having a gracious &s;en&s;e of his father's &s;er|vices and &s;ufferings, and the ill circum&s;tances the petitioner is thereby reduced to, his maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to direct, that the &s;ame be tran&s;mitted to your lord&s;hip, and that you re|commend his ca&s;e to the general a&s;&s;embly of New-York, being the only place, where he can be relieved, and the prayer of his petition complied with. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>your lord&s;hip's Mo&s;t obedient and humble &s;ervant, JERSEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As &s;oon as this letter and the petition were brought into the hou&s;e, a thou&s;and pounds were ordered to be levied for the benefit of mr. Lei&s;ler, as well as &s;everal &s;ums for other per&s;ons, by a bill for paying the debts of the government; which, neverthele&s;s, did not pa&s;s into a law, till the next &s;e&s;&s;ions. Every thing that was done at this meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, which continued till the 18th of October, was un|der the influence of a party &s;pirit; and nothing can be a ful|ler evidence of it, than an incorrect, impertinent addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, which was drawn up by the hou&s;e, at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;igned by fourteen of the members. It contains a tedious narrative of their proceedings, relating
<PB N="116" REF="024800_0112_0FCD63396D4BB018">to the di&s;puted elections, and concludes with a little incen&s;e, to regale &s;ome of the then principal agents in the public affairs, in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"This nece&s;&s;ary account of our&s;elves and our unhappy divi&s;ions, which we hope the moderation of our lieutenant-governor, the wi&s;dom and prudence of William Atwood, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> our chief ju&s;tice, and Thomas Weaver, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> your ma|je&s;ty's collector and receiver-general, might have healed, we lay before your maje&s;ty with all humility, and deep &s;en&s;e of your maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s to us, lately expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ending over &s;o excellent a per&s;on to be our chief ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>The news of the king's having appointed lord Cornbury to &s;ucceed the earl of Bellamont, &s;o &s;trongly animated the hopes of the Anti-Lei&s;lerian party, that about the com|mencement of the year 1702, Nicholas Bayard promoted &s;e|veral addre&s;&s;es to the king, the parliament, and lord Corn|bury, which were &s;ub&s;cribed at a tavern kept by one Hutch|ins, an alderman of the city of New-York. In that to his maje&s;ty, they a&s;&s;ure him, "That the late differences were not grounded on a regard to his intere&s;t, but the corrupt de&s;igns of tho&s;e, who laid hold on an opportunity to en|rich them&s;elves by the &s;poils of their neighbours." The petition to the parliament &s;ays, that Lei&s;ler and his ad|herents gained the fort at the revolution without any op|po&s;ition; that he oppre&s;&s;ed and impri&s;oned the people without cau&s;e, plundered them of their goods, and com|pelled them to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee their country, though they were well affected to the prince of Orange. That the earl of Bella|mont appointed indigent &s;heriffs, who returned &s;uch mem|bers to the a&s;&s;embly as were unduly elected, and in his lord&s;hip's e&s;teem. That he &s;u&s;pended many from the board of council, who were faithful &s;ervants to the crown, introducing his own tools in their &s;tead. Nay they denied the authority of the late a&s;&s;embly, and added, that the hou&s;e had bribed both the lieutenant-governor and the chief ju&s;tice; the one to pa&s;s their bills, and the other to defend the legality of their proceedings. A third addre&s;s was prepared, to be pre&s;ented to lord Cornbury, to congra|tulate his arrival, as well to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him in their favour, as to prejudice him again&s;t the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>Nothing could have a more natural tendency to excite the wrath of the lieutenant governor, and the revenge of the council and a&s;&s;embly, than the reflexions contained in tho&s;e &s;everal addre&s;&s;es. Nanfan had no &s;ooner received intelligence of them, than he &s;ummoned Hutchins to deliver them up to
<PB N="117" REF="024800_0113_0FCD633B1C2D5930">him, and upon his refu&s;al committed him to jail, on the 19th of January. The next day Nicholas Bayard, Rip Van Dam, Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, hot with party zeal, &s;ent an imprudent addre&s;s to the lieute|nant-governor, boldly ju&s;tifying the legality of the ad|dre&s;s, and demanding his di&s;charge out of cu&s;tody. I have before taken notice, that upon Sloughter's arrival in 1691, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, to recognize the right of king William and queen Mary to the &s;overeignty of this province. At the end of that law, a clau&s;e was added in the&s;e words, "That what&s;oever per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hall by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence what&s;oever, endeavour by force of arms or otherwi&s;e, to di&s;turb the peace, good, and quiet of their maje&s;ties' government, as it is now e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hall be deemed and e&s;teemed as rebels and traitors unto their maje&s;ties, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur the pains, penalties, and forfeitures, as the laws of England have for &s;uch offences made and pro|vided." Under pretext of this law, which Bayard him&s;elf had been per&s;onally concerned in enacting, mr. Nanfan i&s;|&s;ued a warrant for committing him to jail as a traitor, on the 21&s;t of January; and le&s;t the mob &s;hould interpo&s;e, a company of &s;oldiers for a week after, con&s;tantly guarded the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Through the uncertainty of the time of lord Cornbury's arrival, mr. Nanfan cho&s;e to bring the pri&s;oner to his trial, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and for that purpo&s;e i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer, on the 12th of February, to William Atwood, the chief ju&s;tice, and Abraham De Pey&s;ter and Robert Walters, who were the pui&s;ne judges of the &s;u|preme court; and not long after Bayard was arraigned, indicted, tried, and convicted of high trea&s;on. Several rea&s;ons were afterwards offered in arre&s;t of judgment; but as the pri&s;oner was unfortunately in the hands of an enraged party, Atwood over-ruled what was offered, and condemned him to death on the 16th of March. As the proce&s;s of his trial has been long &s;ince printed in the &s;tate trials at large, I leave the reader to his own remarks upon the conduct of the judges, who are generally accu&s;ed of par|tiality.</P>
<P>Bayard applied to mr. Nanfan for a reprieve, till his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure might be known; and obtained it, not without great difficulty, nor till after a &s;eeming confe&s;&s;ion of guilt was extorted. Hutchins, who was al&s;o convicted, was bailed upon the payment of forty pieces of eight to the &s;heriff: but Bayard, who refu&s;ed to procure him the gift of a farm, of about fifteen hundred pounds value, was not relea&s;ed from his confinement, till after the arrival of
<PB N="118" REF="024800_0114_0FCD633DB97A4390">lord Cornbury, who not only gave his con&s;ent to an act for rever&s;ing the late attainders, but procured the queen's con|firmation of it, upon their giving &s;ecurity, according to the advice of &s;ir Edward Northey, not to bring any &s;uits again&s;t tho&s;e who were concerned in their pro&s;ecution; which the attorney-general thought proper, as the act ordained all the proceedings to be obliterated.</P>
<P>After the&s;e trials, Nanfan erected a court of exchequer, and again convened the a&s;&s;embly, who thanked him for his late mea&s;ures, and pa&s;&s;ed an act to out-law Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, who ab&s;conded upon Bayard's com|mitment; another to augment the number of repre&s;enta|tives, and &s;everal others, which were, all but one, after|wards repealed by queen Anne. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, lord Cornbury being daily expected, the lieutenant-governor &s;u&s;pended mr. Living&s;ton from his &s;eat in council, and thus continued to abet Lei&s;ler's party, to the end of his admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P>Lord Cornbury's arrival quite opened a new &s;cene. His father, the earl of Clarendon, adhered to the cau&s;e of the late abdicated king, and always refu&s;ed the oaths both to king William and queen Anne. But the &s;on recommended him&s;elf at the revolution, by appearing very early for the prince of Orange, being one of the fir&s;t officers that de&s;ert|ed king James's army. King William, in gratitude for his &s;ervices, gave him a commi&s;&s;ion for this government, which upon the death of the king, was renewed by queen Anne, who at the &s;ame time, appointed him to the chief command of New-Jer&s;ey, the government of which the proprietors had lately &s;urrendered into her hands. As lord Cornbury came to this province, in very indigent circum&s;tances, hunt|ed out of England by a ho&s;t of hungry creditors, he was bent upon getting as much money, as he could &s;queeze out of the pur&s;es of an impoveri&s;hed people. His talents were, perhaps, not &s;uperior to the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of his predece&s;&s;ors; but in his zeal for the church he was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by none. With the&s;e bright qualifications he began his ad|mini&s;tration on the 3d of May, 1702, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a council con&s;i&s;ting of the following members:

<P>His lord&s;hip, without the lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;e, e&s;pou&s;ing the
<PB N="119" REF="024800_0115_0FCD634086252690">Anti-Lei&s;lerian faction, Atwood, the chief ju&s;tice, and Weaver, who acted in quality of &s;olicitor-general, thought proper to retire from his frowns to Virginia, whence they &s;ailed to England: the former concealing him&s;elf under the name of Jones, while the latter called him&s;elf Jack&s;on. Colonel Heathcote and doctor Bridges &s;ucceeded in their places at the council board.</P>
<P>The following &s;ummer was remarkable for an uncommon mortality, which prevailed in the city of New-York, and makes a grand epoch among our inhabitants, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the "time of the great &s;ickne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fever killed almo&s;t every patient &s;eized with it, and was brought here in a ve&s;&s;el from St. Thomas in the We&s;t Indies, an i&s;land remarkable for contagious di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE>." On this occa&s;ion lord Cornbury had his re&s;idence and court at Jamaica, a plea|&s;ant village on Long-I&s;land, di&s;tant about twelve miles from the city.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Jamaica con&s;i&s;ted, at that time, partly of original Dutch planters, but mo&s;tly of New-England emigrants, encouraged to &s;ettle there, after the &s;urrender, by the duke of York's conditions for plantations, one of which was in the&s;e words: "That every town&s;hip &s;hould be obliged to pay their own mini&s;ters, according to &s;uch agreements as they &s;hould make with him; the mini&s;ter being elected by the major part of the hou&s;eholders and in|habitants of the town." The&s;e people had erected an edi|fice for the wor&s;hip of God, and enjoyed a hand&s;ome dona|tion of a par&s;onage-hou&s;e and glebe, for the u&s;e of their mi|ni&s;ter. After the mini&s;try act was pa&s;&s;ed, by colonel Fletcher, in 1693, a few epi&s;copalians crept into the town, and view|ed the pre&s;byterian church with a jealous eye. The town vote, in virtue of which the building had been erected, con|tained no clau&s;e to prevent its being hereafter engro&s;&s;ed by any other &s;ect. The epi&s;copal party, who knew this, form|ed a de&s;ign of &s;eizing the edifice for them&s;elves, which they &s;hortly after carried into execution, by entering the church between the morning and evening &s;ervice, while the pre&s;|byterian mini&s;ter and his congregation were in perfect &s;ecurity, un&s;u&s;picious of the zeal of their adver&s;aries, and a fraudulent ejectment, on a day con&s;ecrated to &s;acred re&s;t.</P>
<P>Great outrage en&s;ued among the people; for the conten|tion, being <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> was animating and important. The original proprietors of the hou&s;e tore up their &s;eats,
<PB N="120" REF="024800_0116_0FCD634191714D30">and afterwards got the key and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church, which were &s;hortly after again taken from them by force and violence. In the&s;e controver&s;ies the governor abetted the epi&s;copal zealots, and harra&s;&s;ed the others by numberle&s;s pro&s;ecutions, heavy &s;ines, and long impri&s;onments; thro' fear of which, many, who had been active in the di&s;pute, fled out of the province. Lord Cornbury's noble de&s;cent and education &s;hould have prevented him from taking part in &s;o ignominious a quarrel: but his lord&s;hip's &s;en&s;e of ho|nour and ju&s;tice was as weak and indelicate, as his bigotry was rampant and uncontroulable; and hence we find him guilty of an act complicated of a number of vices, which no man could have perpetrated without violence to the very &s;lighte&s;t remains of genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice. When his ex|cellency retired to Jamaica, one Hubbard, the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter, lived in the be&s;t hou&s;e in the town. His lord&s;hip begged the loan of it for the u&s;e of his own family; and the clergyman put him&s;elf to no &s;mall inconvenience to fa|vour the governor's reque&s;t: but in return for the generous benefaction, his lord&s;hip perfidiou&s;ly delivered the par&s;on|age-hou&s;e into the hands of the epi&s;copal party, and encou|raged one Cardwel, the &s;heriff, a mean fellow, who after|wards put an end to his own life, to &s;eize upon the glebe, which he &s;urveyed into lots, and farmed for the benefit of the epi&s;copal church. The&s;e tyrannical mea&s;ures ju&s;tly in|flamed the indignation of the injured &s;ufferers, and that again the more embittered his lord&s;hip again&s;t them. They re&s;ented, and he pro&s;ecuted; nor did he confine his pious rage to the people of Jamaica. He dete&s;ted all who were of the &s;ame denomination; nay, aver&s;e to every &s;ect except his own, he in&s;i&s;ted that neither the mini&s;ters nor &s;chool|ma&s;ters of the Dutch, the mo&s;t numerous per&s;ua&s;ion in the province, had a right to preach or in&s;truct without his gu|bernatorial licence: and &s;ome of them tamely &s;ubmitted to his authoritative rule. A general account of his lord&s;hip's &s;in|gular zeal, is pre&s;erved under the title of the Watch Tower, in a number of papers publi&s;hed in the New-York Weekly Mercury, for the year 1755.</P>
<P>While his excellency was exerting his bigotry, during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, at Jamaica; the elections were carrying on, with great heat, for an a&s;&s;embly, which met him, at that village, in the fall. It con&s;i&s;ted principally of the party which had been borne down by the earl of Bellamont and his kin&s;man; and hence we find Philip French, who had lately been out-lawed, was returned a repre&s;entative for New-York, and William Nicoll elected into the &s;peaker's
<PB N="121" REF="024800_0117_0FCD634493AEA688">chair. Several extracts from my lord's &s;peech are proper to be laid before the reader, as a &s;pecimen of his temper and de&s;igns. "It was an extreme &s;urpri&s;e to me (&s;ays his lord|&s;hip) to find this province, at my landing at New-York, in &s;uch a convul&s;ion as mu&s;t have unavoidably occa&s;ioned its ruin, if it had been &s;uffered to go on a little longer. The many complaints that were brought to me, again&s;t the per|&s;ons I found here in power, &s;ufficiently proved again&s;t them &mdash;and the mi&s;erable accounts I had of the condition of our frontiers&mdash;made me think it convenient to delay my meeting you in general a&s;&s;embly, till I could inform my&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the condition of this province, that I might be able to offer to your con&s;ideration, &s;ome few of tho&s;e things, which will be nece&s;&s;ary to be done forthwith, for the de|fence of the country."</P>
<P>He then recommends their fortifying the port of New-York, and the frontiers; adding, that he found the &s;oldiers naked and unarmed: after which he propo&s;es a militia bill, the erection of public &s;chools, and an examination of the provincial debts and accounts; and not only promi&s;es to make a faithful application of the monies to be rai&s;ed, but that he would render them an account. The whole &s;peech is &s;weetened with this gracious conclu&s;ion: "Now, gentlemen, I have no more to trouble you with, but to a&s;|&s;ure you, in the name of the great queen of England, my mi&s;tre&s;s, that you may &s;afely depend upon all the protec|tion that good and faithful &s;ubjects can de&s;ire or expect, from a &s;overeign who&s;e greate&s;t delight is the welfare of her people, under who&s;e au&s;picious reign we are &s;ure to enjoy what no nation in the world dares claim but the &s;ub|jects of England; I mean, the free enjoyment of the be&s;t religion in the world, the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all lawful liber|ty, and the undi&s;turbed enjoyment of our freeholds and properties. The&s;e are &s;ome of the many benefits which I take the inhabitants of this province to be well entitled to by the laws of England; and I am glad of this opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you, that as long as I have the honour to &s;erve the queen in the government of this province, tho&s;e laws &s;hall be put in execution, according to the intent with which they were made; that is, for the pre&s;ervation and protecti|on of the people, and not for their oppre&s;&s;ion. I heartily re|joice to &s;ee, that the free choice of the people has fallen upon gentlemen, who&s;e con&s;tant fidelity to the crown, and unwearied application to the good of their country, is &s;o univer&s;ally known."</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="024800_0118_0FCD6346C1189038">
The hou&s;e echoed back an addre&s;s of high compliment to his lord&s;hip, declaring, "That being deeply &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;ery and calamity the country lay under at his arrival, they were not &s;ufficiently able to expre&s;s the &s;atisfaction they had, both in their relief and their deliverer."</P>
<P>Well plea&s;ed with a governor who headed their party, the a&s;&s;embly granted him all his reque&s;ts; eighteen hun|dred pounds were rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of one hundred and eighty men, to defend the frontiers, be&s;ides two thou|&s;and pounds more, as a pre&s;ent, towards defraying the ex|pen&s;es of his voyage. The queen, by her letter of the 20th of April, in the next year, forbid any &s;uch donations for the future. It is ob&s;ervable, that though the county of Duche&s;s had no repre&s;entatives at this a&s;&s;embly, yet &s;uch was then the known indigence of that now populous and flouri&s;hing county, that but eighteen pounds were appor|tioned for their quota of the&s;e levies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the acts above-mentioned, the hou&s;e brought up a militia bill, and continued the revenue to the 1&s;t of May, 1709; and a law pa&s;&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h a grammar-&s;chool, ac|cording to his lord&s;hip's recommendation. Be&s;ides the great harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the governor and his a&s;|&s;embly, there was nothing remarkable, except two re|&s;olves again&s;t the court of chancery erected by mr. Nanfan, occa&s;ioned by a petition of &s;everal di&s;appointed &s;uitors, who were di&s;plea&s;ed with a decree. The re&s;olutions were in the&s;e words: "That the &s;etting up a court of equity in this colony, without con&s;ent of general a&s;&s;embly, is an in|novation without any former precedent, inconvenient and contrary to the Engli&s;h law." And again: "That the court of chancery, as lately erected, and managed here, was and is unwarrantable, a great oppre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubject, of pernicious example and con&s;equence; that all proceed|ings, orders, and decrees in the &s;ame, are, and of right ought to be, declared null and void; and that a bill be brought in, according to the&s;e two re&s;olutions," which was done: but though his lord&s;hip was by no means di&s;inclined to fix contempt on Nanfan's admini&s;tration, yet, as this bill would dimini&s;h his own power, him&s;elf being the chancel|lor, the matter was never moved farther, than to the order for the engro&s;&s;ment of the bill upon the &s;econd reading.</P>
<P>Though a war was proclaimed by England on the 4th of May, 1702, again&s;t France and Spain, yet as the five nations had entered into a treaty of neutrality with the French in Canada, this province, in&s;tead of being harra&s;&s;ed on its
<PB N="123" REF="024800_0119_0FCD6348EA91F6E8">borders by the enemy, carried on a trade very advantage|ous to all tho&s;e who were concerned in it. The governor, however, continued his &s;olicitations for money, with unre|mitted importunity, and by alarming the a&s;&s;embly, which met in April 1703, with his expectation of an attack by &s;ea, fifteen hundred pounds were rai&s;ed, under pretence of erecting two batteries at the Narrows, which, in&s;tead of being employed for that u&s;e, his lord&s;hip, notwith&s;tanding the province had expended twenty two thou&s;and pounds during the late peace, was plea&s;ed to appropriate to his pri|vate advantage. But let us do him the ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that while he was robbing the public, he at the &s;ame time con&s;ented to &s;everal other laws for the emolument of the clergy.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the extraordinary &s;agacity of the hou&s;e, or their pre&s;umption that his lord&s;hip was as lit|tle to be tru&s;ted as any of his predece&s;&s;ors, that, after voting the above &s;um for the batteries, they added, that it &s;hould be "for no other u&s;e what&s;oever," I leave the reader to determine. It is certain they now began to &s;ee the danger of throwing the public money into the hands of a receiver-general, appointed by the crown, from whence the gover|nor, by his warrants, might draw it at his plea&s;ure. To this cau&s;e we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign it, that in an addre&s;s to his lord|&s;hip, on the 19th of June, 1703, they "de&s;ire and in&s;i&s;t, that &s;ome proper and &s;ufficient per&s;on might be commi&s;|&s;ioned trea&s;urer, for the receiving and paying &s;uch monies now intended to be rai&s;ed for the public u&s;e, as a means to ob&s;truct mi&s;applications for the future." Another addre&s;s was &s;ent home to the queen, complaining of the ill &s;tate of the revenue, through the frauds which had formerly been committed, the better to facilitate the important de|&s;ign of having a trea&s;urer dependent on the a&s;&s;embly. The &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e mea&s;ures will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Tho' our frontiers enjoyed the profounde&s;t tranquillity all the next winter, and we had expended thirteen hundred pounds, in &s;upporting one hundred fuzileers about Albany, be&s;ides the four independent companies in the pay of the crown, yet his excellency demanded provi&s;ions for one hun|dred and fifty men, at the next meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, in April, 1704. The hou&s;e having rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the &s;everal &s;ums of eighteen and thirteen hundred pounds, lately rai&s;ed for the public &s;ervice, had been prodigally expend|ed or embezzled, prudently declined any farther aids, till they were &s;atisfied that no mi&s;application had been made. For this purpo&s;e they appointed a committee, who reported.
<PB N="124" REF="024800_0120_0FCD634AAB0D9370">that there was a balance of near a thou&s;and pounds due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the colony. His lord&s;hip, who had hitherto been treated with great complai&s;ance, took offence at this par&s;imonious &s;crutiny, and ordered the a&s;&s;embly to attend him; when af|ter the example of Fletcher, whom, abating that man's &s;u|perior activity, his lord&s;hip mo&s;tly re&s;embled, he made an angry &s;peech, in which he charges them with innovations never attempted by their predece&s;&s;ors, and hopes they would not force him to exert "certain powers" ve&s;ted in him by the queen. But what he more particularly took notice of, was their in&s;i&s;ting in &s;everal late bills, upon the title of "general a&s;&s;embly," and a &s;aving of the "rights of the hou&s;e," in a re&s;olve agreeing to an amendment for prevent|ing delay; with re&s;pect to which, his lord&s;hip has the&s;e words: "I know of no right that you have as an a&s;&s;embly, but &s;uch as the queen is plea&s;ed to allow you." As to the vote, by which they found a balance due to the colony, of nine hundred and thirteen pounds, fifteen &s;hillings, "it is true (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) the queen is plea&s;ed to command me in her in&s;tructions, to permit the a&s;&s;embly, from time to time, to view and examine the accounts of money, or va|lue of money, di&s;po&s;ed by virtue of the laws made by them: but you can in no wi&s;e meddle with that money; but if you find any mi&s;application of any of that money, you ought to acquaint me with it, that I may take care to &s;ee tho&s;e mi&s;takes rectified, which I &s;hall certainly do."</P>
<P>The hou&s;e bore the&s;e rebukes with the utmo&s;t pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s, contenting them&s;elves with little el&s;e than a general com|plaint of the deficiency of the revenue, which became the &s;ubject of their particular con&s;ideration in the fall. The governor, on the one hand, then propo&s;ed an additional duty of ten per cent. on certain goods, not immediately im|ported from Europe, to which the a&s;&s;embly, on the other, were utterly aver&s;e, and as &s;oon as they re&s;olved again&s;t it, the very printer, clerk, and door-keeper, were denied the payment of their &s;alaries. Several other demands being made for the public debts, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s his lord&s;hip for an exact account of the revenue, which, to|gether with their refu&s;al, to admit the council's amendment to a money bill, gave him &s;uch high provocation, that he was induced to di&s;&s;olve an a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e prodigal liber|ality had ju&s;tly expo&s;ed them to the re&s;entment of the peo|ple. The new a&s;&s;embly, which met on the 14th of June, 1705, neglected the affair of the revenue and the additional duty, though his lord&s;hip &s;trongly recommended them both. Among the principal acts pa&s;&s;ed at this meeting, is that for
<PB N="125" REF="024800_0121_0FCD634C4B407288">the benefit of the clergy, who were entitled to the &s;alaries formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed by colonel Fletcher; which, though le&s;s than his lord&s;hip recommended, was doubtle&s;s a grateful offering to his uncea&s;ing zeal for the church, manife&s;ted in a part of his &s;peech at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, in the&s;e words: "The difficulties, which &s;ome very worthy mini&s;|ters of the church of England have met with, in getting the maintenance &s;ettled upon them, by an act of the general a&s;&s;embly of this province, pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1693, moves me to propo&s;e to you the pa&s;&s;ing an act explanatory of the forementioned act, that tho&s;e worthy good men who have ventured to come &s;o far for the &s;ervice of God in his church, and the good and edification of the people, to the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls, may not for the future be vexed, as &s;ome of them have been; but may enjoy in quiet, that maintenance, which was by a law provided for them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The majority of our people are of a contrary opinion, if my lord thought the e&s;tabli&s;hment was de&s;igned only for the epi&s;copal clergy.</NOTE>. I farther re|commend to you, the pa&s;&s;ing an act to provide for the main|tenance of &s;ome mini&s;ters, in &s;ome of the towns at the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land, where I don't find any provi&s;ion has been yet made for propagating religion."</P>
<P>Our harbour being wholly unfortified, a French priva|teer actually entered it in 1705, and put the inhabitants into great con&s;ternation. The a&s;&s;embly, at their &s;e&s;&s;ion in June, the next year, were not di&s;inclined, through the im|portunity of the people, to put the city in a better po&s;ture of defence for the future; but being fully convinced, by his lord&s;hip's embezzlement of 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> formerly rai&s;ed for two batteries at the narrows, and near 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> levied for the protection of the frontiers, that he was no more to be tru&s;t|ed with public monies, offered a bill for rai&s;ing 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for fortifications, appointing that &s;um to be depo&s;ited in the hands of a private per&s;on of their own nomination; but his excellency did not pa&s;s it till their next meeting in the fall, when he informed them that he had received the queen's commands, "to permit the general a&s;&s;embly to name their own trea&s;urer, when they rai&s;ed extraordinary &s;upplies for particular u&s;es, and which are no part of the &s;tanding and con&s;tant revenue; the trea&s;urer being accountable to the three branches of the legi&s;lature, and the governor always acquainted with the occa&s;ion of i&s;&s;uing &s;uch warrants".</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="024800_0122_0FCD634D8F580A20">
His lord&s;hip's renewing the propo&s;al of rai&s;ing fortifi|cations at the Narrows, which he had him&s;elf hitherto &s;can|dalou&s;ly prevented, is a proof of his exce&s;&s;ive effrontery and contempt of the people: and the neglect of the hou&s;e, to take the lea&s;t notice, either of that matter, or the revenue, occa&s;ioned another di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the tran&s;actions of the new a&s;&s;embly, which did not meet till the year 1708, it will not be im|proper to lay before the reader, the account of a memor|able proof of that per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, which influenced lord Cornbury's whole admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the city of New-York con&s;i&s;ted, at this time, of Dutch Calvini&s;ts, upon the plan of the church of Holland; French refugees on the Geneva model; a few Engli&s;h epi&s;copalians; and a &s;till &s;maller number of Eng|li&s;h and Iri&s;h pre&s;byterians; who, having neither a mini&s;ter nor a church, u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves, every Sunday, at a private hou&s;e, for the wor&s;hip of God. Such were their circum&s;tances, when Francis M'Kemie and John Hampton, two pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, arrived here in January, 1707. As &s;oon as lord Cornbury, who hated the whole per&s;ua&s;ion, heard that the Dutch had con&s;ented to M'Kemie's preach|ing in their church, he arbitrarily forbid it; &s;o that the public wor&s;hip, on the next &s;abbath, was performed, with open doors, at a private hou&s;e. Mr. Hampton preached, the &s;ame day, at the pre&s;byterian church in New-Town, di&s;tant a few miles from the city. At that village both the&s;e mini&s;ters were two or three days after apprehended, by Cardwel, the &s;heriff, pur&s;uant to his lord&s;hip's warrant, for preaching without his licence. From hence they were led in triumph a circuit of &s;everal miles through Jamaica to New-York. They appeared before his lord&s;hip with an un|daunted courage, and had a conference with him, in which it is difficult to determine, whether my lord excelled in the character of a &s;avage bigot, or an ill-mannerly tyrant. The mini&s;ters were no lawyers, or they would not have founded their ju&s;tification on the &s;uppo&s;ed extent of the Engli&s;h act of toleration. They knew not that the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;tatutes had no relation to this colony; and that its religious &s;tate con&s;i&s;ted in a perfect parity between prote&s;|tants of all denominations. They erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the penal laws extended to this province, and relied, for their defence, on the toleration, offering te&s;timonials of their having complied with the act of parliament in Virgi|nia and Maryland, and promi&s;ed to certify the hou&s;e, in which M'Kemie had preached, to the next &s;e&s;&s;ions. His lord|&s;hip's
<PB N="127" REF="024800_0123_0FCD634F0F6E2E18">di&s;cour&s;e with them was the more ridiculous, becau&s;e he had Bickley, the attorney-general, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Again&s;t the exten&s;ion of the &s;tatute, they in&s;i&s;ted, that the penal laws were limited to England, and &s;o al&s;o the toleration act, becau&s;e the &s;ole intent of it was to take away the penalties formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed. But grant the po&s;ition, and the con|&s;equence they drew from it, argues that my lord and mr. at|torney were either very weak, or influenced by evil de&s;igns. If the penal laws did not extend to the plantations, then the pri&s;oners were innocent; for where there is no law, there can be no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but according to the&s;e in|comparable &s;ages, if the penal laws and the toleration were re&s;tricted to the realm of England, as they contended, then the poor clergymen, for preaching without his licence, were guilty of a heinous crime, again&s;t his private, unpub|li&s;hed in&s;tructions; and for this cau&s;e he i&s;&s;ued an informal precept to the &s;heriff of New-York, for their commitment to jail, till further orders. They continued in con&s;inement, through the ab&s;ence of Mompe&s;&s;on, the chief ju&s;tice, who was in New-Jer&s;ey, &s;ix weeks and four days; but were then brought before him, by writ of <HI>habeas corpus.</HI> Mom|pe&s;&s;on being a man of learning in his profe&s;&s;ion, and his lord&s;hip now appri&s;ed of the illegality of his fir&s;t warrant, i&s;&s;ued another, on the very day of the te&s;t of the writ, in which he virtually contradicts what he had before in&s;i&s;ted on, at his conference with the pri&s;oners. For according to this, they were impri&s;oned for preaching without being qualified as the toleration act required, though they had of|fered them&s;elves to the &s;e&s;&s;ions during their impri&s;onment. They were then bailed to the next &s;upreme court, which began a few days after. Great pains were taken to &s;ecure a grand jury for the purpo&s;e, and among tho&s;e who found the indictment, to their &s;hame be it remembered, were &s;everal Dutch and French prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Mr. M'Kemie returned to New-York, from Virginia, in June; and was now come to his trial on the indictment found at the la&s;t court: As to mr. Hampton, he was di&s;charg|ed, no evidence being offered to the grand jury again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Bickley, the attorney general, managed the pro&s;ecution in the name of the queen; Reignere, Nicoll, and Jami&s;on appeared for the defendant. The trial was held on the 6th of June, and being a cau&s;e of great expectation, a nu|merous audience attended. Roger Mompe&s;&s;on &s;at on the bench as chief ju&s;tice, with Robert Milward and Thomas Wenham, for his a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The indictment was, in &s;ub|&s;tance, that Francis M'Kemie, pretending him&s;elf to be a
<PB N="128" REF="024800_0124_0FCD6350B1E19B88">prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, contemning and endeavour|ing to &s;ubvert the queen's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, unlaw|fully preached without the governor's licence fir&s;t ob|tained, in derogation of the royal authority and preroga|tive: that he u&s;ed other rites and ceremonies, than tho&s;e con|tained in the common-prayer book. And la&s;tly, that being unqualified by law to preach, he neverthele&s;s did preach at an illegal conventicle: and both the&s;e la&s;t charges were laid to be contrary to the form of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes. For it &s;eems that mr. attorney was now of opinion, that the penal laws did extend to the American plantations, though his &s;entiments were the very rever&s;e at the fir&s;t debate be|fore his excellency: but Bickley was rather remarkable for a voluble tongue, than a penetrating head, or much learning. To &s;upport this pro&s;ecution, he endeavoured to prove the queen's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy in the colonies, and that it was delegated to her noble cou&s;in, the governor; and hence he was of opinion, that his lord&s;hip's in&s;tructi|ons relating to church matters, had the force of a law. He, in the next place, contended for the exten&s;ion of the &s;ta|tutes of uniformity, and, upon the whole, was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that he did not doubt the jury would find a verdict for the queen. Reignere, for the defendant, in&s;i&s;ted, that preaching was no crime by the common law; that the &s;ta|tutes of uniformity, and the act of toleration did not ex|tend here; and that the governor's in&s;tructions were not laws. Nicoll &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and &s;o did David Jami&s;on, but M'Kemie concluded the whole defence in a &s;peech, which &s;ets his capacity in a very advantageous light. The reader may &s;ee it in the narrative of this trial, which was fir&s;t publi&s;hed at the time, and &s;ince reprinted at New-York in the year 1755. The chief ju&s;tice, in his charge, ad|vi&s;ed a &s;pecial verdict, but the jury found no difficulty to acquit the defendant, who, through the &s;hameful parti|ality of the court, was not di&s;charged from his recogni|zance, till they had illegally extorted all the fees of his pro&s;ecution, which, together with his expen&s;es, amounted to eighty-three pounds &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence.</P>
<P>Lord Cornbury was now daily lo&s;ing the favour of the people. The friends of Lei&s;ler had him in the utmo&s;t abhor|rence from the beginning; and being all &s;pies upon his conduct, it was impo&s;&s;ible for his lord&s;hip to commit the &s;malle&s;t crime unnoticed. His per&s;ecution of the pre&s;by|terians very early increa&s;ed the number of his enemies. The Dutch, too, were fearful of his religious rage again&s;t them, as he di&s;puted their right to call and &s;ettle mini&s;ters,
<PB N="129" REF="024800_0125_0FCD63522A967358">or even &s;choolma&s;ters, without his &s;pecial licence. His ex|ce&s;&s;ive avarice, his embezzlement of the public money, and his &s;ordid refu&s;al to pay his private debts, bore &s;o heavily upon his reputation, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for his adherents, either to &s;upport him, or them&s;elves, again&s;t the general oppo&s;ition. Such being the temper of the people, his lord|&s;hip did not &s;ucceed according to his wi&s;hes in the new a&s;|&s;embly, which met on the 19th of Augu&s;t, 1708. The mem|bers were all again&s;t him, and William Nicoll was again cho&s;en &s;peaker.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal things recommended to their con&s;ider|ation, the affair of the revenue, which was to expire in May following, and the propriety of making pre&s;ents to the In|dians, were the chief. The hou&s;e were not in&s;en&s;ible of the importance of the Indian intere&s;t, and of the infinite arts of the French to &s;educe them from our alliance: but &s;u&s;pi|cious that his lord&s;hip, who heretofore had given him&s;elf little concern about that matter, was &s;eeking a fre&s;h oppor|tunity to defraud the public, they de&s;ired him to give them a li&s;t of the articles of which the pre&s;ents were to con&s;i&s;t, together with an e&s;timate of the charge, before they would provide for that donation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the revenue, his lord&s;hip was not &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful, for the a&s;&s;embly re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to continue it; tho' they con&s;ented to an act to di&s;charge him from a con|tract of 250<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards, which he had made with one Han&s;on for the public &s;ervice. Thomas Byerly was at that time, collector and receiver-general; and by pretending that the trea&s;ury was exhau&s;ted, the debts of the govern|ment were unpaid. This gave ri&s;e to many petitions to the a&s;&s;embly to make provi&s;ion for their di&s;charge. Colonel Schuyler, who had expended large &s;ums on the public cre|dit, was among the principal &s;ufferers, and joined with &s;e|veral others in an application to the hou&s;e, that Byerly might be compelled to account. The di&s;putes, relating to this mat|ter, took up a con&s;iderable part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and were litigated with great heat. Upon the whole, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for refunding 700<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which had been mi&s;applied.</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions of the committee of grievances, approved by the hou&s;e, &s;how the general objections of the people to his lord&s;hip's admini&s;tration. The&s;e were made at the be|ginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and yet we find this haughty lord &s;ubdued by the oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, and &s;o di&s;pirited thro' indigence, and the ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitations of his credi|tors, that he not only omitted to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, but to &s;how even an impotent re&s;entment. For after all the cen&s;ures of
<PB N="130" REF="024800_0126_0FCD63538C8AF000">the hou&s;e, he tamely thanked them, for pa&s;&s;ing the bill to di&s;charge him from a &s;mall debt, which they could not, in ju&s;tice, have refu&s;ed. The re&s;olutions were in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the appointing coroners in this colony, without their being cho&s;en by the people, is a grievance, and contrary to law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See lord Bacon's works, fol. edit. 2 vol. 152. and yet the coroners in every county are &s;till appointed by the governor.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>"Re&s;olved, That for any officer what&s;oever, to extort from the people, extravagant and unlimited fees, or any money what&s;oever, not po&s;itively e&s;tabli&s;hed and regulated by con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is unrea&s;onable and unlaw|ful, a great grievance, and tending to the utter de&s;truction of all property in this plantation.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the erecting a court of equity, with|out con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is contrary to law, without precedent, and of dangerous con&s;equence to the liberty and property of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the rai&s;ing of money for the govern|ment, or other nece&s;&s;ary charge, by any tax, impo&s;t, or bur|den on goods imported, or exported,&mdash;or any clog, or hindrance, on traffic or commerce,&mdash;is &s;ound by experience to be the expul&s;ion of many, and the impoveri&s;hing of the re&s;t of the planters, freeholders, and inhabitants of this co|lony; of mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence, which, if continued, will unavoidably prove the ruin of the colony.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That the exce&s;&s;ive &s;ums of money &s;crewed from ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els trading here under the notion of port-charges, vi&s;iting the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els by &s;upernumerary of|ficers, and taking extraordinary fees, is the great di&s;courage|ment of trade and &s;trangers coming among us, beyond the precedent of any other port, and without colour of law.</P>

<P>Lord Corubury was no le&s;s obnoxions to the people of New-Jer&s;ey, than to tho&s;e of New-York. The a&s;&s;embly of that province, impatient of his tyranny, drew up a com|plaint again&s;t him, which they &s;ent home to the queen.</P>
<P>Her maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly li&s;tened to the cries of her injured &s;ubjects; dive&s;ted him of his power, and appointed lord Lovelace in his &s;tead; declaring that &s;he would not coun|tenance her neare&s;t relations in oppre&s;&s;ing her people.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my lord was &s;uper&s;eded, his creditors threw him into the cu&s;tody of the &s;heriff of New-York; and he re|mained here till the death of his father, when &s;ucceeding to the earldom of Clarendon, he returned to England.</P>
<P>We never had a governor &s;o univer&s;ally dete&s;ted, nor any who &s;o richly de&s;erved the public abhorrence. In &s;pite of his noble de&s;cent, his behaviour was trifling, mean, and extra|vagant.</P>
<P>It was not uncommon for him to dre&s;s him&s;elf in a wo|man's habit, and then to patrole the fort in which he re&s;ided. Such freaks of low humour expo&s;ed him to the univer&s;al contempt of the people; but their indignation was kindled by his de&s;potic rule, &s;avage bigotry, in&s;atiable avarice, and inju&s;tice, not only to the public, but even his private credi|tors. For he left &s;ome of the lowe&s;t trade&s;men in his em|ployment un&s;atisfied in their ju&s;t demands.</P>
<P>John lord Lovelace, baron of Hurley, was appointed to this government, in the &s;pring, 1708, but did not arrive here till the 18th of December following. Lord Cornbury's oppre&s;&s;ive, mean admini&s;tration had long made the people very de&s;irous of a change; and therefore his &s;ucce&s;&s;or was re|ceived with univer&s;al joy. Having di&s;&s;olved the general a&s;|&s;embly, &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the government, he con|vened a new one on the 5th of April, 1709, which, con&s;i&s;t|ing of members of the &s;ame intere&s;t with the la&s;t, re-elected William Nicoll, the former &s;peaker, into the chair. His lord|&s;hip told them, at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. "That he had brought with him large &s;upplies of &s;oldiers and &s;tores of
<PB N="132" REF="024800_0128_0FCD63581C7CF418">war as well as pre&s;ents for the Indians," than which nothing could be more agreeable to the people. He lamented the great|ne&s;s of the provincial debts, and the decay of public credit; but &s;till recommended their rai&s;ing a revenue, for the &s;ame term with that e&s;tabli&s;hed by the act in the 11th year of the la&s;t reign. He al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed the di&s;charge of the debts of the government, and their examination of the public accounts, "that it may be known (&s;ays he) what this debt is, and that it may appear hereafter to all the world that it was not con|tracted in my time." This oblique reflexion upon his pre|dece&s;&s;or, who was now ignominiou&s;ly impri&s;oned by his creditors, was di&s;plea&s;ing to no body.</P>
<P>Tho' the a&s;&s;embly, in their an&s;wer, heartily congratu|lated his lord&s;hip's arrival, and thanked the queen for her care of the province, yet they &s;ufficiently intimated their di&s;inclination to rai&s;e the revenue, which the governor had reque&s;ted. "Our earne&s;t wi&s;hes (to u&s;e the words of the addre&s;s) are, that &s;uitable mea&s;ures may be taken, to en|courage the few inhabitants left, to &s;tay in it, and others to come. The ju&s;t freedom enjoyed by our neighbours, by the tender indulgence of the government, has extremely drain|ed and exhau&s;ted us both of people and &s;tock; whil&s;t a dif|ferent treatment, the wrong methods too long taken, and &s;everities practi&s;ed here, have averted and deterred the u&s;ual part of mankind from &s;ettling and coming hitherto." Towards the clo&s;e, they a&s;&s;ure him, "That as the begin|ning of his government gave them a delightful pro&s;pect of tranquillity, &s;o they were come with minds prepared to con|&s;ult the good of the country and his &s;atisfaction."</P>
<P>The principal matter, which engaged the attention of the a&s;&s;embly, was the affair of the revenue. Lord Cornbury's conduct had rendered them utterly aver&s;e to a permanent &s;upport for the future; and yet they were unwilling to quarrel with the new governor. They however, at la&s;t, a|greed on the 5th of May, to rai&s;e 2500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to defray the charges of the government to the 1&s;t of May en&s;uing; 1600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> of which was voted to his excellency, and the remaining &s;ums towards a &s;upply of firewood and candles to the &s;everal forts in New-York, Albany, and Schenectady; and for pay|ment of &s;mall &s;alaries to the printer, clerk of the council, and Indian interpreter.</P>
<P>This new project of providing, annually, for the &s;upport of government, was contrived to prevent the mi&s;chiefs, to which the long revenues had formerly expo&s;ed us. But as it rendered the governor, and all the other &s;ervants of the crown dependent upon the a&s;&s;embly, a rupture, between
<PB N="133" REF="024800_0129_0FCD63599893AFE0">the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature, would doubtle&s;s have en&s;ued: but the very day, in which the vote pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e, his lord&s;hip died of a di&s;order contracted in cro&s;&s;ing the ferry at his fir&s;t arrival in the city of New-York. His lady continued here, long after his death, &s;oliciting for the &s;um voted to her hu&s;band; but though the queen interpo&s;ed, by a letter, in her behalf, nothing was allowed till &s;everal years afterwards.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NEW-YORK. <HI>PART IV.</HI> From the Canada expedition in <HI>1709,</HI> to the arrival of governor Burnet.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Lovelace being dead, the chief command devolv|ed upon Richard Ingol&s;by, the lieutenant-governor, the &s;ame who had exerci&s;ed the government &s;everal years before, upon the decea&s;e of colonel Sloughter. His &s;hort ad|mini&s;tration is remarkable, not for his extraordinary talents, for he was a heavy man, but for a &s;econd fruitle&s;s attempt again&s;t Canada. Colonel Vetch, who had been, &s;everal years before, at Quebec, and &s;ounded the river of St. Lawrence, was the fir&s;t projector of this enterpri&s;e. The mini&s;try ap|proved of it, and Vetch arrived in Bo&s;ton, and prevailed upon the New-England colonies to join in the &s;cheme. After that, he came to New-York, and concerted the plan of o|perations with Francis Nichol&s;on, formerly our lieutenant-governor, who, at the reque&s;t of Ingol&s;by, the council, the a&s;&s;embly, Gurdon Saiton&s;tal, the governor of Connecticut, and Charles Gookin, lieutenant governor of Penn&s;ylvania, accepted the chief command of the provincial forces, in|tended to penetrate into Canada, by the way of lake Cham|plain. Impoveri&s;hed as we were, the a&s;&s;embly joined heartily in the enterpri&s;e. It was at this juncture, our fir&s;t act for i&s;&s;uing bills of credit was pa&s;&s;ed; an expedient without which we could not have contributed to the expedition, the trea|&s;ury
<PB N="136" REF="024800_0131_0FCD63600F5F1AB8">being then totally exhau&s;ted. Univer&s;al joy now bright|ened every man's countenance, becau&s;e all expected the complete reduction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anada before the en&s;uing fail. Big with the plea&s;ing p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;pect of an event, which would put a period to all the ravages o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an encroaching, mercile&s;s enemy, extend the Briti&s;h empire, and augment our trade, we exerted our&s;elves to the utmo&s;t&punc; for the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. As &s;oon as the de&s;ign was made known to the hou&s;e, twenty &s;hip and hou&s;e carpenters were impre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice for building batteans. Commi&s;&s;ioners al&s;o were appointed to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;a|ries, and empowered to break open hou&s;es for that purpo&s;e, and to impre&s;s men, ve&s;&s;els, hor&s;es, and waggons, for tran&s;|porting the &s;tores. Four hundred and eighty &s;even men, be&s;ides the independent companies, were rai&s;ed and di&s;|patched to Albany, by the 27th of June; from whence they advanced, with the main body, to the Wood Creek. Three forts were built there, be&s;ides many block-hou&s;es and &s;tores for the provi&s;ions, which were tran&s;ported with great di&s;|patch. The province of New-York (all things con&s;idered) has the merit of having contributed more than any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> neighbours towards this expedition. Penn&s;ylvania ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> no kind of aid; and New-Jer&s;ey was only at the expen&s;e of 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> One hundred batteans, as many birch canoes, and two of the forts, were built entirely, and the other fort, for the mo&s;t part, at the charge of this government. All the provi&s;ions and &s;tores for the army, were tran&s;ported at our expen&s;e; and be&s;ides our quota of volunteers and the in|dependent companies, we procured and maintained &s;ix hundred Indians, and victualled a thou&s;and of their wives and children at Albany, during the campaign.</P>
<P>Having thus put our&s;elves to the expen&s;e of above twenty thou&s;and pounds towards this enterpri&s;e, the delay of the arrival of the flee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pread a general di&s;content through the country; and ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in the fall, the a&s;&s;embly addre&s;&s;ed the lieutenant-governor, to recall our forces from the camp. Vetch and Nichol&s;on &s;oon after broke up the campaign, and retired to New-Port in Rhode-I&s;land, where there was a congre&s;s of governors. Ingol&s;by, who was invited to it, did not appear, in compliance with the inclination of the a&s;&s;embly, who, incen&s;ed at the public di&s;appointment, har|boured great jealou&s;ies of all the fir&s;t promoters of the de|&s;ign. As &s;oon, therefore, as lord Sunde land's letters, which arrived here on the 21&s;t of October, were laid before the hou&s;e, they re&s;olved to &s;end an addre&s;s to the queen, to lay before he a true account of the manner, in which this pro|vince exerted it&s;elf in the late undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024800_0132_0FCD636291806090">
Had this expedition been vigorou&s;ly carried on, doubt|le&s;s it would have &s;ucceeded. The public affairs at home were conducted by a wi&s;e mini&s;try. The allied army tri|umphed in repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Flanders; and the court of France was in no condition to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;o di&s;tant a colony as Canada. The Indians of the five nations were engaged, through the indefatigable &s;olicitations of colonel Schuyler, to join heartily in the attempt: and the ea&s;tern colonies had nothing to fear from the Ouwenagungas; be|cau&s;e tho&s;e Indians had, a little before, concluded a peace with the confederates. In America, every thing was ripe for the attack. At home, lord Sunderland, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, had proceeded &s;o far, as to di&s;patch orders to the queen's &s;hips at Bo&s;ton, to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s, and the Briti&s;h troops were upon the point of their embark|a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. At this juncture, the news arrived of the de&s;cat of the Portugue&s;e, which reducing our allies to great &s;treights, the forces intended for the American adventure were then ordered to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the thoughts of the mini&s;try entirely diverted from the Canada expedition.</P>
<P>As we had not a man in this province, who had more extended views of the importance of driving the French out of Canada, than colonel Schuyler, &s;o neither did any per|&s;on more heartily engage in the late expedition. To pre|&s;erve the friend&s;hip of the five nations, without which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent our frontiers from becom|ing a field of blood, he &s;tudied all the arts of in&s;inuating him&s;elf into their favour. He gave them all po&s;&s;ible encour|agement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and very much impaired his own fortune, by his liberality to their chiefs. They never came to Albany, but they re&s;orted to his hou&s;e, and even dined at his table; and by this means, he obtained an a&s;cendency over them, which was attended with very good con&s;equen|ces to the province; for he could always, in a great degree, obviate or e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dicate the prejudices and jealou&s;ies, by which the French je&s;uits were ince&s;&s;antly labouring to debauch their fidelity.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome vi|gorous mea&s;ures again&s;t the French, colonel Schuyler was extremely di&s;contented at the late di&s;appointment; and re|&s;olved to make a voyage to England at his private expen&s;e, the better to inculcate on the mini&s;try, the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of reducing Canada to the crown of Great-Britain. For that purpo&s;e, he propo&s;ed to carry home with him five Indian chiefs. The hou&s;e no &s;ooner heard of his de&s;ign, than they came to a re&s;olution, which, in ju&s;tice to
<PB N="138" REF="024800_0133_0FCD63640DD55220">his di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, I ought not to &s;uppre&s;s. It was this:</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, nemine contradicento, that the humble ad|dre&s;s of the lieutenat-governor, council, and general a&s;&s;em|bly of this colony to the queen, repre&s;enting the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this plantation, be committed to his charge and care, to be pre&s;ented by him&s;elf to her &s;acred maje&s;ty; he being a per&s;on, who, not only in the la&s;t war, when he commanded the forces of this colony in chief at Canada, but al&s;o in the pre&s;ent, has performed faithful &s;ervices, to this and the neighbouring colonies; and behaved him&s;elf in the offices, with which he has been entru&s;ted, with good reputation, and the general &s;atisfaction of the people in the&s;e parts."</P>
<P>The arrival of the five &s;achems in England, made a great bruit through the whole kingdom. The mob followed wherever they went, and &s;mall cuts of them were &s;old among the people. The court was at that time in mourning for the death of the prince of Denmark: the&s;e American kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This title is commonly be&s;towed on the &s;achems, though the Indians have no &s;uch dignity or office among them.</NOTE> were therefore dre&s;&s;ed in black underclothes, after the Engli&s;h manner; but in&s;tead of a blanket, they had each a &s;carlet-in-grain cloth mantle, edged with gold, thrown over all their other garments. This dre&s;s was direct|ed by the dre&s;&s;ers of the playhou&s;e, and given by the queen, who was advi&s;ed to make a &s;how of them. A more than or|dinary &s;olemnity attended the audience they had of her maje&s;ty. Sir Charles Cotterel conducted them, in two coaches, to St. James's; and the lord chamberlain introduced them into the royal pre&s;ence. Their &s;peech, on the 19th of April, 1710, is pre&s;erved by Oldmixon, and was in the&s;e words:</P>

<P>While colonel Schuyler was at the Briti&s;h court, captain Ingol&s;by was di&s;placed, and Gerardus Beekman exerci&s;ed the powers of government, from the 10th of April, 1710, till the arrival of brigadier Hunter, on the 14th of June following. The council then pre&s;ent were,

<P>Hunter was a native of Scotland, and, when a boy, put apprentice to an apothecary. He left his ma&s;ter, and went into the army; and being a man of wit and per&s;onal beau|ty, recommended him&s;elf to lady Hay, whom he after|wards married. In the year 1707, he was appointed lieu|tenant-governor of Virginia, but being taken by the French in his voyage to that colony, he was carried into France, and upon his return to England, appointed to &s;ucceed lord Lovelace in the government of this and the province of New-Jer&s;ey. Dean Swift's letter to him, during his captivity, &s;hows that he had the honour of an intimacy with mr. Addi|&s;on and others, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their good &s;en&s;e and learning; and perhaps it was by their intere&s;t, he was advanced to this profitable place.</P>
<P>Governor Hunter brought over with him near three thou|&s;and palatines, who, the year before, fled to England from the rage of per&s;ecution in Germany. Many of the&s;e people &s;eated them&s;elves in the city of New-York, where they built a Lutheran church, which is now in a declining condition.

Their village there, called the camp, is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t &s;ituations on Hud&s;on's river: right oppo&s;ite, on the we&s;t bank, are many other families of them. Some went into Penn&s;ylvania, and by the favourable ac|counts of the country, which they tran&s;mitted to Ger|many, were in&s;trumental to the tran&s;migration of many thou&s;ands of their countrymen into that province. Queen Anne's liberality to the&s;e people, was not more beneficial to them, than &s;erviceable to this colony. They have behav|ed them&s;elves peaceably, and lived with great indu&s;try. Many are rich. all are prote&s;tants, and well affected to the government. The &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;aid of tho&s;e who have lately &s;ettled among&s;t us, and planted the lands we&s;tward of Al|bany. We have not the lea&s;t ground for jealou&s;y with re&s;|pect to them. Among&s;t us they are few in number, com|pared to tho&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania. There they are too numer|ous, to be &s;oon a&s;&s;imilated to a new con&s;titution. They re|tain all the manners and principles which prevail in their native country, and, as many of them are papi&s;ts, &s;ome are not without their fears, that, &s;ooner or later, they will be|come dangerous to our colonies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;urpri&s;ing importation of Germans into that colo|ny, gave ri&s;e to the &s;cheme of di&s;pen&s;ing Engli&s;h clergy|men and &s;choolma&s;ters among them. The project is found|ed on principles of &s;ound policy. If a political mi&s;&s;ion a|mong the Indians had been &s;ea&s;onably encouraged, the pro|vince of Penn&s;ylvania might have e&s;caped all that &s;hocking deva&s;tation, which en&s;ued the fatal defeat of general Brad|dock's army on the 9th of July, 1755; and would, perhaps, have prevented even the erection of fort Que&s;ne, which has already co&s;t the nation &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure.</NOTE></P>
<P>The late attempt to attack Canada proving abortive, ex|po&s;ed us to con&s;equences equally calamitous, dreaded, and fore&s;een. While the preparations were making to invade it, the French exerted them&s;elves in cajoling their Indian al|lies to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the repul&s;e, and as &s;oon as the &s;cheme drop|ped, numerous parties were &s;ent out to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra&s;s the Engli&s;h frontiers. The&s;e irruptions were, principally, made on the northern parts of New-England, where the mo&s;t &s;avage cruel|ties were daily committed. New-York had, indeed, hither|to e&s;caped, being covered by the Indians of the five nations; but the danger we were in, induced governor Hunter, &s;oon after his arrival, to make a voyage to Albany, where he met
<PB N="141" REF="024800_0136_0FCD636C521257C0">the confederate chiefs, and renewed the old covenant. While there, he was &s;trongly &s;olicited, by the New-England governments, to engage our Indians in a war with tho&s;e who were daily ravaging their borders: but he prudently declined a mea&s;ure, which might have expo&s;ed his own province to a general deva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cation. A treaty of neutrality &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, at that time, between the confederates and the Canada French and their Indians; which, depending upon the faith of lawle&s;s &s;avages, was, at be&s;t, but precarious, and yet the only &s;ecurity we had for the peare of our borders. A rup|ture between them would have involved us in a &s;cene of mi|&s;ery, at a time, of all others, mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable. However the people of New-England might cen&s;ure the governor, it was a proof of wi&s;dom to refu&s;e their reque&s;t. For be&s;ides a want of men and arms to de&s;end us, our forts were fallen down, and the trea&s;ury exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The new a&s;&s;embly met, at New-York, ou the 1&s;t of Sep|tember. Mr. Nicoll, the &s;peaker, mr. Living&s;ton, mr. de Lancey, and colonel Morris, were the members mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed for their activity in the hou&s;e. Mr. de Lancey was a prote&s;tant refugee, a native of Caen in Normandy; and by marrying a daughter of mr. Courtlandt, connected with a family, then, perhaps, the mo&s;t opulent and exten|&s;ive of any in the province. He was an eminent merchant, and, by a &s;ucce&s;sful trade, had ama&s;&s;ed a very con&s;iderable fortune. But of all the&s;e colonel Morris had the greate&s;t in|fluence on our public affairs. He was a man of letters, and though a little whim&s;ical in his temper, was grave in his manners, and of penetrating parts. Being exce&s;&s;ively fond of the &s;ociety of men of &s;en&s;e and reading, he was never wearied at a &s;itting, till the &s;pirits of the whole company were di&s;&s;ipated. From his infancy, he had lived in a man|ner be&s;t adapted to teach him the nature of man, and to fortify his mind for the vici&s;&s;itudes of life. He very early lo&s;t both his father and mother, and fell under the patron|age of his uncle, formerly an officer, of very con&s;iderable rank in Cromwell's army; who, after the re&s;toration, di&s;|gui&s;ed him&s;elf under the profe&s;&s;ion of quakeri&s;m, and &s;et|tled on a fine farm, within a few miles of the city, called, after his own name, Morri&s;ania. Being a boy of &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ions, (the general indications of a fruitful genius,) he gave frequent offence to his uncle, and, on one of the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, through fear of his re&s;entment, &s;trolled away into Vir|ginia, and thence to Jamaica in the We&s;t-Indies, where, to &s;upport him&s;elf, he &s;et up for a &s;crivener. After &s;everal years &s;pent in this vagabond life, he returned again to bi
<PB N="142" REF="024800_0137_0FCD636DCE3E83D0">uncle, who received the young prodigal with joy; and, to reduce him to regularity, brought about his marriage with a daughter of mr. Graham, a fine lady, with whom he lived above fifty years, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every enjoyment, which good &s;en&s;e and polite manners in a woman could af|for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. The greate&s;t part of his life, before the arrival of mr. Hunter, was &s;pent in New-Jer&s;ey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was one of the council in that province, and a judge of the &s;upreme court there, in 1692. Upon the &s;urrender of the government to queen Anne, in 1702, he was named to be governor of the colony; but the appointment was changed in favour of lord Cornbury, the queen's cou&s;in.</NOTE>, where he &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the &s;ervice both of the proprietors and the a&s;&s;em|bly. The latter employed him to draw up their complaint again&s;t my lord Cornbury, and he was made the bearer of it to the queen. Though he was indolent in the management of his private affairs, yet, through the love of power, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> always bu&s;y in matters of a political nature, and no man in the colony equalled him in the knowledge of the law and the arts of intrigue. From this character, the reader will ea&s;ily perceive, that governor Hunter &s;howed his prudence, in taking mr. Morris into his confidence, his talents and ad|vantages rendering him either a u&s;eful friend or formidable foe. Such were the acting members of this a&s;&s;embly. When brigadier Hunter &s;poke to them, he recommended the &s;et|tling a revenue, the defence of the frontiers, and the re&s;to|ration of the public credit, which lord Cornbury had al+mo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed. To &s;tifle the remaining &s;parks of our ancient feuds, he concluded with the&s;e words: "If any go about to di&s;turb your peace, by reviving buried parties or piques, or creating new ones, they &s;hall meet with no countenance or encouragement from me; and I am &s;ure they de&s;erve as little from you." The addre&s;s of the hou&s;e was perfectly agreeable to the governor. They promi&s;ed to provide for the &s;upport of government, and to re&s;tore the public credit, as well as to protect the frontiers. In an&s;wer to the clo&s;e of his &s;peech, they declare their hope, "That &s;uch as excited party contentions, might meet with as little credit, and as much di&s;grace, as they de&s;erve." This una|nimity, however, was &s;oon interrupted. Colonel Morris, for &s;ome warm words dropped in a debate, was expelled the hou&s;e; and &s;oon after a di&s;pute aro&s;e, between the council and a&s;&s;embly, concerning &s;ome amendments, made by the former, to a bill "for the trea&s;urer's paying &s;undry
<PB N="143" REF="024800_0138_0FCD637238460950">&s;ums of money." The de&s;ign of it, in mentioning the par|ticular &s;ums, and rendering them i&s;&s;uable by their own of|ficer, was to re&s;train the governor from repeating the mi&s;|applications which had been &s;o frequent in a late admini&s;|tration. The council, for that rea&s;on, oppo&s;ed it, and ad|hered to their amendments; which occa&s;ioned a prorogati|on, on the 25th of November, after the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;everal other nece&s;&s;ity laws.</P>
<P>Mr. Hunter cautiou&s;ly avoided entering, publicly, into the di&s;pute between the two hou&s;es, till he knew the &s;en|timents of the mini&s;try, and then he opened the &s;pring &s;e&s;|&s;ions with a &s;peech too &s;ingular not to he in&s;erted.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I hope you are now come with a di&s;po&s;ition to an&s;wer the ends of your meeting, that is, to provide a &s;uitable &s;up|port for her maje&s;ty's government here, in the manner &s;he has been plea&s;ed to direct; to find out means to re&s;tore the public credit, and to provide better for your own &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>They abu&s;e you, who tell you, that you are hardly dealt by in the augmentation of &s;alaries. Her maje&s;ty's in&s;truc|tions, which I communicated to you at our la&s;t meeting, might have convinced you, that is was her tenderne&s;s to|wards her &s;ubjects in the plantations, who &s;uffered under an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of making con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to their governors, by acts of a&s;&s;embly, that induced her to allot to each of them &s;uch a &s;alary as &s;he judged &s;ufficient for their &s;upport, in their re&s;pective &s;tations, with a &s;trict prohibi|tion of all &s;uch pre&s;ents for the future; which in&s;truction has met with a chearful and grateful compliance in all the other colonies.</P>
<P>If you have been in any thing di&s;tingui&s;hed, it is by an extraordinary mea&s;ure of her royal bounty and care. I hope you will make &s;uitable returns, le&s;t &s;ome in&s;inuations, much repeated of late years, &s;hould gain credit at la&s;t, that how|ever your re&s;entment has fallen upon the governor, it is the government you di&s;like.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, at this time, that you be told al&s;o, that giving money for the &s;upport of government, and di&s;po&s;ing of it at your plea&s;ure, is the &s;ame with giving none at all. Her maje&s;ty is the &s;ole judge of the merits of her &s;ervants. This right has never yet been di&s;puted at home, and &s;hould I con&s;ent to give it up abroad, I &s;hould render my&s;elf unworthy, not only of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, but of the &s;ociety of my fellow &s;ubjects, by incurring her highe&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure. If I have tired you by a long &s;peech, I &s;hall make

<P>Will you &s;upport her maje&s;ty's government, in the manner &s;he has been plea&s;ed to direct, or are you re&s;olved that burden &s;hall lie &s;till upon the governor, who cannot accu&s;e him&s;elf of any thing that may have de&s;erved this treatment at your hands?</P>
<P>Will you take care of the debts of the government; or, to increa&s;e my &s;ufferings, mu&s;t I continue under the torture of the daily cries of &s;uch as have ju&s;t demands upon you, and are in mi&s;ery, without the power of giving them my hopes of relief?</P>
<P>Will you take more effectual care of your own &s;afety, in that of your frontiers; or are you re&s;olved for the fu|ture to rely upon the &s;ecurity of an open winter, and the caprice of your &s;avage neighbours? I &s;hall be very &s;orry if this plainne&s;s offends you. I judge it nece&s;&s;ary towards the e&s;tabli&s;hing and cultivating a good under&s;tanding betwixt us.

<P>Perplexed with this remarkable &s;peech, the a&s;&s;embly, af|ter a few days, concluded, that as his excellency had pro|rogued them in February, while he was at Burlington, in the province of New-Jer&s;ey, they could not &s;it and act as a hou&s;e; upon which, they were the &s;ame day di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The five Indian kings, carried to England by colonel Schuyler, having &s;een all the curio&s;ities in London, and been much entertained by many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, re|turned to Bo&s;ton, with commodore Martin and colonel Nichol&s;on; the latter of whom commanded the forces de|&s;igned again&s;t Port-Royal and the coa&s;t of Nova-Scotia. In this enterpri&s;e the New-England colonies, agreeable to their wonted courage and loyalty, lent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the reduction of the garri&s;on, which was then called Annapo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is-Royal, was happily completed on the 2d of October, 1710. Animated by this, and &s;ome other &s;ucce&s;&s;es in New-foundland, Nichol&s;on again urged the pro&s;ecution of the &s;cheme for the reduction of Canada; which, having been &s;trongly recommended by the Indian chiefs, as the only ef|fectual means to &s;ecure the northern colonies, was now again re&s;umed.</P>
<P>Towards the execution of this project, five thou&s;and troops from England and Flanders, were &s;ent over under the command of brigadier Hill, the brother of mrs. Ma&s;ham, the queen's new confidant, on the di&s;grace of the duche&s;s of
<PB N="145" REF="024800_0140_0FCD6374C0D14250">Marlborough. The fleet of tran&s;ports, under the convoy of &s;ir Hoveden Walker, arrived, after a month's pa&s;&s;age, at Bo&s;ton, on the 4th of June, 1711. The provi&s;ions, with which they expected to be &s;upplied there, being not provid|ed, the troops landed. Nichol&s;on, who was to command the land forces, came immediately to New-York, where in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Hunter convened the a&s;&s;embly, on the 2d of July. The re|election of the &s;ame members, who had &s;erved in the la&s;t, was a &s;ufficient proof of the general aver&s;ion to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a revenue. Robert Living&s;ton, junior, who married the only daughter of colonel Schuyler, came in for Albauy; and, together with mr. Morris, who was again cho&s;en for the borough of We&s;t-Che&s;ter, joined the governor's intere&s;t. Brigadier Hunter informed the a&s;&s;embly of the intended expedition, and the arrival of the fleet and forces; that the quota of this province, &s;ettled by the council of war, at New-London, was 600 private centinels and their officers: be&s;ides which, he recommended their making provi&s;ion for building batteaus, tran&s;porting the troops and provi&s;ions, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the Indians, and for the contingent charges: nor did he forget to mention the &s;upport of government and the public debts.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the de&s;ign upon Ca|nada, that they voted an addre&s;s of thanks to the queen, and &s;ent a committee to Nichol&s;on, to congratulate his ar|rival, and make an honourable acknowledgment of his "&s;e|dulous application to her maje&s;ty for reducing Canada." In a few days time, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for rai&s;ing forces; and the a&s;&s;embly, by a re&s;olution, according to the governor's advice, re&s;tricted the price of provi&s;ions to certain particu|lar &s;ums. Bills of credit, for forwarding the expedition, were now al&s;o &s;truck, to the amount of 10,000<ABBR>d.</ABBR> to be &s;unk in five years, by a tax on e&s;tates real and per&s;onal. After the&s;e &s;upplies were granted, the governor prorogued the a&s;&s;embly; though nothing was done relating to the ordi|nary &s;upport of government.</P>
<P>While the&s;e preparations were making at New-York, the fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve men of war, forty tran&s;ports, and &s;ix &s;tore-&s;hips, with forty hor&s;es, a fine train of artillery and all manner of warlike &s;tores, &s;ailed for Canada, from Bo&s;|ton, on the 30th of July; and, about a month afterwards, Nichol&s;on appeared at Albany, at the head of an army of four thou&s;and men, rai&s;ed in this and the colonies of New-Jer&s;ey and Connecticut: the &s;everal regiments being com|manded by colonel Ingol&s;by, colonel Whiting, and colonel
<PB N="146" REF="024800_0141_0FCD637B709A98B0">Schuyler, the latter of whom procured 600 of the five na|tions to join our army.</P>
<P>The French, in Canada, were not unappri&s;ed of the&s;e de&s;igns. Vandreuil, the governor general, &s;ent his orders, from Montreal, to the &s;ieur de Beaucourt, to ha&s;ten the works he was about at Quebee, and commanded that all the regulars and militia &s;hould be held in readine&s;s to march on the fir&s;t warning. Four or five hundred Indians, of the more di&s;tant nations, arrived at the &s;ame time at Montreal, with me&s;&s;ieurs St. Pierre and Tonti, who, together with the Caghnuaga pro&s;elytes, took up the hatchet in favour of the French. Vaudreuil after di&s;patching &s;everal Indians and two mi&s;&s;ionaries among the five nations, to detach them from our intere&s;t, went to Quebec, which Beaucourt, the engineer, had &s;ufficiently fortified to &s;u&s;tain a long &s;iege. All the prin|cipal po&s;ts below the city, on both &s;ides of the river, were prepared to receive the Briti&s;h troops in ca&s;e of their land|ing. On the 14th of Augu&s;t, &s;ir Hoveden Walker arrived with the fleet in the mouth of St. Lawrence river; and fear|ing to lo&s;e the company of the tran&s;ports, the wind blow|ing fre&s;h at north-we&s;t, he put into Ga&s;py bay, and con|tinued there till the 20th of the &s;ame month. Two days af|ter he &s;ailed from thence, the fleet was in the utmo&s;t dan|ger, for they had no &s;oundings, were without &s;ight of land, the wind high at ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and the &s;ky darkened by a thick fog. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the fleet brought to, by the advice of the pilots, who were of opinion, that if the &s;hipe lay with their heads to the &s;outhward, they might be driven by the &s;tream into the mid&s;t of the channel: but in&s;tead of that, in two hours after, they found them&s;elves on the north &s;hore, among rocks and i&s;lands, and upon the point of being lo&s;t. The men of war e&s;caped, but eight tran&s;ports, containing eight hundred &s;ouls, officers, &s;ol|diers, and &s;eamen, were ca&s;t away. Two or three days being &s;pent, in recovering what they could from the &s;hore, it was determined, at a con&s;ultation of &s;ea officers, to return to &s;ome bay or harbour, till a further re&s;olution could be taken. On the 14th of September, they arrived at Spani&s;h-River bay, where a council of war, con&s;i&s;ting of land and &s;ea of|ficers, con&s;idering that they had but ten weeks provi&s;ion, and judging that they could not depend upon a &s;upply from New-England, unanimou&s;ly concluded to return home, without making any farther attempts; and they according|ly arrived at Port&s;mouth on the 9th of October, when, in addition to our misfortunes, the Edgar, a 70 gun &s;hip, was
<PB N="147" REF="024800_0142_0FCD637CCD85C6D8">blown up, having on board above four hundred men, be|&s;ides many per&s;ons who came to vi&s;it their friends.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the marquis de Vaudreuil, by the accounts of the fi&s;hermen and two other &s;hips, had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that our fleet was returned, he went to Chambly, and formed a camp of three thou&s;and men to oppo&s;e Nichol&s;on's army, intended to penetrate Canada, at that end. But he was &s;oon informed that our troops were returned, upon the news of the di&s;a&s;ter which had befallen the fleet, and that the peo|ple of Albany were in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>The new mini&s;try are generally cen&s;ured for their con|duct in this expedition by the whigs, who condemn both the project and the mea&s;ures taken towards its execution. The &s;cheme was never laid before the parliament, though it was then &s;itting; but this, it is &s;aid, was for the greater &s;ecrecy, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the fleet was not fully victualled at home. They relied upon New-England for &s;up|plies, and this de&s;troyed the de&s;ign. For the &s;hips tarried at Bo&s;ton, till the &s;ea&s;on for the attack was over.</P>
<P>According to lord Harley's account of this expedition, the whole was a contrivance of Bolingbroke, Moore, and the lord chancellor Harcourt, to cheat the public of twenty thou&s;and pounds. The latter of the&s;e was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, "No government was worth &s;erving, that would not admit of &s;uch advantageous jobs."</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ive that the enemy would fall upon our bor|ders, as they afterwards really did, in &s;mall parties, upon the mi&s;carriage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at enterpri&s;e; governor Hunter pre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly, in autumn, to continue a number of men in pay the en&s;uing winter, and to repair the out-forts. After the hou&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal votes to this purpo&s;e, his ex|cellency, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, went up to Albany, to withdraw the forces of the colony, and give orders for the nece&s;&s;ary repairs.</P>
<P>The public debts, by this unfortunate expedition, were become greatly enhanced, and the a&s;&s;embly, at la&s;t, enter|ed upon mea&s;ures for the &s;upport of the government, and &s;ent up to the council &s;everal bills for that purpo&s;e. The latter attempted to make amendments, which the other would not admit, and a warm controver&s;y aro&s;e between tho&s;e two branches of the legi&s;lature. The council a&s;&s;igned in&s;tances, that amendments had formerly been allowed: and, be&s;ides this argument, drawn from precedent, in&s;i&s;ted that they were a part of the legi&s;lature, con&s;tituted as the a&s;&s;embly were, "by the mere grace of the crown;" adding that the lords of made had determined the matter in their
<PB N="148" REF="024800_0143_0FCD637E59115008">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. The hou&s;e neverthele&s;s, adhered to their re&s;olutions, and an&s;wered in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"'Tis true, the &s;hare the council have (if any) in the le|gi&s;lation, does not flow from any title they have from the nature of that board, which is only to advi&s;e; or from their being another di&s;tinct &s;tate, or rank of people in the con&s;ti|tution, which they are not, being all commons; but only from the mere plea&s;ure of the prince, &s;ignified in the com|mi&s;&s;ion. On the contrary, the inherent right the a&s;&s;embly have to di&s;po&s;e of the money of the freemen of this colony, does not proceed from any commi&s;&s;ion, letters patent, or other grant from the crown; but from the free choice and election of the people, who ought not to be dive&s;ted of their property (nor ju&s;tly can) without their con&s;ent. Any former conde&s;cen&s;ions, of other a&s;&s;emblies, will not pre&s;|cribe to the council, a privilege to make any of tho&s;e amend|ments, and therefore they have it not. If the lords com|mi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations, did conceive no rea&s;on why the council &s;hould not have right to amend money bills, this is far from concluding there are none. The a&s;&s;em|bly under&s;tand them very well, and are &s;ufficiently con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity they are in, not to admit of any en|croachment &s;o much to their prejudice."</P>
<P>Both hou&s;es adhered ob&s;tinately to their re&s;pective opini|ons: in con&s;equence of which, the public debts remained unpaid, though his excellency could not omit pa&s;&s;ing a bill for paying to him&s;elf 3750 ounces of plate.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the fleet, Dudley, Salton&s;tal, and Cran&s;ton, the governors of the ea&s;tern colonies, formed a de&s;ign of engaging the five nations in a rupture with the French, and wrote on that head to mr. Hunter; who, &s;u&s;|picious that his a&s;&s;embly would not approve of any project that might increa&s;e the public debts, laid their letter before the hou&s;e, and, according to his expectations, they declar|ed again&s;t the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>About this time colonel Hunter, by the advice of his council, began to exerci&s;e the office of chancellor, having, on the 4th of October, appointed me&s;&s;ieurs Van Dam and Philip&s;e, ma&s;ters, mr. Whileman, regi&s;ter, mr. Harri&s;on, examiner, and me&s;&s;ieurs Sharpas and Broughton, clerks. A proclamation was then i&s;&s;ued, to &s;ignify the &s;itting of the court on Thur&s;day in every week. This gave ri&s;e to the&s;e two re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that the erecting a court of chancery, with|out con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is contrary to law, with|out
<PB N="149" REF="024800_0144_0FCD637FCE466B40">precedent, and of dangerous con&s;equences to the liberty and property of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>"That the e&s;tabli&s;hing fees, without con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is contrary to law." The council made the&s;e votes the &s;ubject of part of a long repre&s;entation, which they &s;hortly after tran&s;mitted to the lords of trade, who, in a letter to the governor, in an&s;wer to it, approved of his e|recting a court of equity, and blamed the a&s;&s;embly; adding, "That her maje&s;ty has an undoubted right of appointing &s;uch, and &s;o many courts of judicature, in the plantati|ons, as &s;he &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>At the next meeting, in May 1712, colonel Hunter &s;trong|ly recommended the public debts to the con&s;ideration of the a&s;&s;embly, informing them, that the lords of trade had &s;ignified their opinion, with re&s;pect to the amending money bills, in favour of the council. The hou&s;e neglected the matters laid before them, and the governor broke up the &s;e&s;&s;ion by a &s;hort prorogation of three days. After which they &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed an act for paying his excellency 8025 ounces of plate. Our public affairs never wore a more melancholy a&s;pect than at this juncture.</P>
<P>Among the five nations many emi&s;&s;aries from the French were daily &s;educing them from the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, and our late ill &s;ucce&s;s gave &s;uch a powerful influence to their &s;olici|tations, that the Indians even at Catt's Kill &s;ent a belt of Wampum to tho&s;e in Duche&s;s county, to prepare for a war. The Senecas and Shawanas were al&s;o greatly di&s;affected: and it was generally apprehended that they would fall upon the inhabitants along Hud&s;on's river. An inva&s;ion was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, by &s;ea, on the city of New-York, where they had been alarmed, in April, by an in&s;urrection of the negroes; who, in execution of a plot to &s;et fire to the town, had burnt down a hou&s;e in the night, and killed &s;everal people who came to extingui&s;h the fire, for which nineteen of them were afterwards executed. But di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as the co|lony then was, the a&s;&s;embly were inflexibly aver&s;e to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a revenue, which had formerly been wickedly mi&s;applied and exhau&s;ted. At the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion, in the fall, colonel Hunter propo&s;ed a &s;cheme to the a&s;&s;em|bly, which was, in &s;ub&s;tance, that the receiver-general &s;hould give &s;ecurity, re&s;iding in the colony, for the due execution of his office; and, every quarter, account, to the governor and council, for the &s;ums he might receive. That the creditors of the government &s;hould, every three months,
<PB N="150" REF="024800_0145_0FCD63ED15BF1BB0">deliver in their demands to the governor and council; when, if that quarter's revenue equalled the amount of &s;uch debts, the governor, by the advice of council, &s;hould draw for it; but if the revenue for that quarter, &s;hould fall &s;hort of the governor's demands; then the warrants were to be drawn for &s;o much only as remained, and the creditors &s;hould afterwards receive new drafts for their balances in the next quarter. That no warrant &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued, until the quarterly account of the revenue was given in; but that then they &s;hould be paid in cour&s;e, and an action of debt be given again&s;t the receiver-general in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. That he &s;hould account al&s;o to the a&s;&s;embly when required, and permit all per&s;ons to have recour&s;e to his books. The hou&s;e turned a deaf ear to this plau&s;ible project, and, di&s;|plea&s;ed with a letter from the lords of trade, favouring the council's claim to amend money bills, they agreed upon an ad|dre&s;s to the queen, prote&s;ting their willingne&s;s to &s;upport her government, complaining of mi&s;applications in the trea&s;ury, intimating their &s;u&s;picions that they were mi&s;repre&s;ented, and praying an in&s;truction to the governor to give his con|&s;ent to a law, for &s;upporting an agent to repre&s;ent them at the court of Great Britain. Provoked by this conduct, and to put an end to the di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two hou&s;es, his excellency di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Before the meeting of the next a&s;&s;embly, the peace of Utrecht was concluded, on the 31&s;t of March, 1713. A peace, in the judgment of many, di&s;honourable to Great-Britain, and injurious to her allies. I &s;hall only con&s;ider it with relation to our Indian affairs. The reader doubtle&s;s ob&s;erved, that lord Bellamont, after the peace at Ry&s;wick, contended with the governor of Canada, that the five na|tions ought to be con&s;idered as &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown, and that the point was di&s;puted even after the death of count Frontenac. It does not appear that any deci&s;ion of that matter was made between the two crowns, till the trea|ty of Utrecht, the XVth article of which is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"The &s;ubjects of France inhabiting Canada, and others, &s;hall hereafter give no hindrance or mole&s;tation to the five nations, or cantons of Indians, &s;ubject to the dominion of Great-Britain, nor to the other nations of America who are friends to the &s;ame. In like manner, the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain &s;hall behave them&s;elves peaceably towards the A|mericans, who are &s;ubjects or friends to France; and on both &s;ides, they &s;hall enjoy full liberty of going and coming on account of trade. Al&s;o the natives of the&s;e countries &s;hall,

But it is to be exactly and di&s;tinctly &s;ettled by commi&s;&s;aries, who are, and who ought to be, accounted the &s;ubjects of Britain or of France."</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this treaty, the Briti&s;h crown became entitled, at lea&s;t for any claim that could ju&s;tly be interpo&s;|ed by the French, to the &s;overeignty over the country of the five nations, concerning the extent of which, as it never was adju&s;ted by commi&s;&s;aries, it may not be improper to &s;ay a few words.</P>
<P>When the Dutch began the &s;ettlement of this country, all the Indians on Long-I&s;land, and the northern &s;hore of the &s;ound, on the banks of Connecticut, Hud&s;on's, Delaware, and Su&s;quehanna rivers, were in &s;ubjection to the five nati|ons; and, within the memory of per&s;ons now living, ac|knowledged it by the payment of an annual tribute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A little tribe, &s;ettled at the &s;ugar-loaf mountain in Orange county, to this day make a yearly payment of about 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the Mohawks.</NOTE>.

It is watered with many rivers. The land is in &s;ome places broken, but, generally &s;peaking, very fertile."</P>
<P>In this partial de&s;cription, the je&s;uit is neither con&s;i&s;tent with his geographer, nor &s;everal other French authors; and yet both his hi&s;tory and mr. Bellin's maps, in 1744<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bellin publi&s;hed a new &s;et of maps in 1745, the fir&s;t plate being thought too favourable to our claims, e&s;pe|cially in the protraction of the north &s;ide of the bay of Fun|dy, for Nova Scotia, which, in the &s;econd plate, was called "the &s;outh part of New France." General Shirley, one of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries for &s;ettling the di&s;puted limits, took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of this alteration to mr. Bellin at Paris, and informed him that 100 copies of his fir&s;t maps were di&s;per&s;ed in London, upon which he di&s;covered &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; but in&s;tead of urging any thing in &s;upport of the variation in his new draft, &s;aid, &s;miling, "we in France mu&s;t follow the command of the monarch." I mention this to &s;how, that &s;ince the French government interpo&s;es in the con&s;truction of their maps, they are proper evidence again&s;t them. Among the Engli&s;h, dr. Mitchel's is the only authen|tic one extant. None of the re&s;t, concerning America, have pa&s;&s;ed under the examination, or received the &s;anction of any public board; and, for this rea&s;on, they ought not to be con&s;trued to our prejudice. Add, that they generally copy from the French.</NOTE>, which are bound up with it, furni&s;h many &s;trong evidences in favour of the Briti&s;h claims. I will point out a few in|&s;tances.
<PB N="153" REF="024800_0148_0FCD6388D66FAAE8">The ancient country of the Hurons is laid down on the north &s;ide of lake Erie, by which we are a&s;certained of the extent of territory, to which the five nations are enti|tled by their conque&s;t of that people. The right of the confederates to the &s;outh &s;ide of that lake, is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by their di&s;per&s;ion of the Cat Indians, to whom it origin|ally belonged. The land, on both &s;ides of the lake Ontario, is admitted to be theirs by this geographer, who writes on the north, "Les Iroquois du nord," and on tthe &s;outh &s;ide, "Pays des Iroquois." Hennepin, la Hontan, and Deli&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, all concur with Bellin, in extending the right of the &s;ive nations, to the lands on the north &s;ide of lake Ontario. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, be&s;ides what appears from his map, &s;peaking of that lake, has the&s;e words, "There are likewi&s;e on the north &s;ide, the&s;e Iroquois villages, Tejajahon, Kente, and Ganneou&s;&s;e;" every one of which is laid down even in Bellin's, and almo&s;t all the maps I have &s;een of that country whether French or Engli&s;h. What renders Hennepin's ac|count the more remarkable, is, that the&s;e villages were there in 1679, &s;even years after the erection of fort Frontenac. From whence it may fairly be argued, that their not oppo|&s;ing tho&s;e works, was by no means a ce&s;&s;ion of the country to the French; and indeed Charlevoix him&s;elf repre&s;ents that matter as carried on by a fraud, for, &s;ays he, "under pretext of &s;eeking their advantage, the governor had no|thing in view, <HI>que de les tenir en bride.</HI>"</P>
<P>To the&s;e atte&s;tations, which are the more to be depended upon, becau&s;e they are given by the French writers, who&s;e partiality leads them to con&s;ine the five nations to contracted limits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bellin was engineer of the marine, and tells us, that Charlevoix performed his travels in this country, by order of the French court; that he was a man of attention and curio&s;ity, and had a determined re&s;olution to collect all po&s;&s;ible intelligence, which he de&s;igned to make public. To give the greater credit to the je&s;uit's hi&s;tory and his own map, he adds, that Charlevoix was never without the in|&s;truments proper for a voyager, <HI>"partout la bou&s;&s;ole a la main."</HI></NOTE>, we may add, that our Indians univer&s;ally concur in the claim of all the lands, not &s;old to the Engli&s;h, from the mouth of Sorel river, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lakes Erie and Ontario, on both &s;ides of the Ohio, till it falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; and on the north &s;ide of tho&s;e lakes, that whole territory between the Outawais river and the lake Huron,

<P>The Briti&s;h title to fort Frontenac, and the lands on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of Cadaracqui river, has of late been drawn into que&s;tion by &s;ome, who, from jealou&s;y, or other motives equally &s;hameful, were bent upon finding fault with every mea&s;ure planned by general Shirley. The advocates for the French claim, relied much on a late map of the middle Briti&s;h colonies, and two pamphlets publi&s;hed by Leves Evans.</P>
<P>"The French," &s;ays he, "being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fort Frontenac, at the peace of Ry&s;wick, which they attained during their war with the confederates, gives them an un|doubted title to the acqui&s;ition of the north-we&s;t &s;ide of St. Lawrence river, from thence to their &s;ettlement at Montreal." The writer adds; "It was upon the faith and honour of king William's promi&s;e (by the fourth article of the treaty of Ry&s;wick) of not di&s;turbing the French king in the fire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdoms, countries, lands, or dominions he then enjoyed, that I &s;aid the French had an undoubted title to their acqui&s;ition of the north-we&s;t &s;ide of St. Lawrence river, from Frontenac to Montreal."</P>
<P>Whether the treaty ought to be con&s;idered, as having any relation to this matter, is a que&s;tion which I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. The map-maker &s;uppo&s;es it to be applicable, and, for the pre&s;ent, I grant it. The XIIth article of this treaty is in the&s;e words: "The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king &s;hall re&s;tore to the king of Great-Britain, all countries, i&s;lands, forts, and colonies, where&s;eoevr &s;ituated, which the Engli&s;h did po&s;&s;e&s;s before the declaration of the pre&s;ent war. And in like manner, the king of Great-Britain &s;hall re&s;tore to the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, all countries, i&s;lands, forts, and colonies, where&s;oever &s;ituated, which the French did po&s;&s;e&s;s before the &s;aid declaration of war." If therefore the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fort Fron|tenac at the commencement of the war, the French, who attained it during its continuance, according to this treaty, ought to have &s;urrendered it to the Briti&s;h crown.</P>
<P>Whatever the French title to fort Frontenac might have been, antecedent to the year 1688, in which the i&s;land of
<PB N="155" REF="024800_0150_0FCD638D7932D668">Montreal was invaded by the &s;ive nations, it is certain, that it was then abandoned, and that the Indians entered it, and demoli&s;hed a great part of the works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le fort de Catarocouy &eacute;toit &eacute;vacu&eacute; &amp; ruin&eacute;.

To which I reply, that the Indians acquired a title in 1688, either by conque&s;t, or dereliction, or both: and that the crown of Great-Britain had a right to take ad|vantage of their acqui&s;ition, in virtue of its &s;o vereignty over the five cantons. That they were our dependents, was &s;trongly and often infi&s;ted upon by governor Dongan and lord HeHamont, and the point remained <HI>&s;ub judice,</HI> till the treaty of Utrecht.

Every public tran&s;action between the French and the five nations, without the participation of the government of Great-Bri|tain, &s;ince the Indians were claimed as our dependents, is perhaps ab&s;olutely void, and particularly the treaty of peace made between the Indians and the chevalier de Callieres, after the death of count Frontenac<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Evans's map and fir&s;t pamphlet, or analy&s;is, were pub|li&s;hed in the &s;ummer 1755, and that part in favour of the French claim to Frontenac, was attacked by two papers in the New York Mercury, in Jan. 1756.

For the governor being now determined to &s;ubdue tho&s;e, whom he could not allure, again di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly. He &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign, for though mr. Nicoll was re-elect|ed into the chair on the 9th of June, 1716, yet we plainly perceive, by the harmony introduced between the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature, that the majority of the hou&s;e were now in the intere&s;t of the governor.</P>
<P>An inconte&s;tible evidence of their good under&s;tanding, appeared at the &s;e&s;&s;ion in autumn, 1717, when the governor informed them of a memorial, which had been &s;ent home, reflecting upon his admini&s;tration. The hou&s;e immediately voted an addre&s;s to him, which was conceived in terms of the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, te&s;tifying their abhorrence of the memorial, as a fal&s;e and malicious libel. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by Mulford, a repre&s;entative for Suffolk county, who always oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures that were taken to pre|&s;erve the friend&s;hip of the five nations, and fooli&s;hly pro|jected a &s;cheme to cut them off. It was printed in England, and delivered to the members at the door of the hou&s;e of commons, but never had the author's intended effect.</P>
<P>It was at this meeting, the council, on the 31&s;t of Octo|ber, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age by mr. Alexander, then deputy &s;ecreta|ry, to the hou&s;e, de&s;iring them "to appoint proper per|&s;ons, for running the divi&s;ion line between this colony and the province of New-Jer&s;ey, his excellency being a&s;&s;ured the legi&s;lature of the province of New-Jer&s;ey will bear half the expen&s;e thereof." The a&s;&s;embly had a bill before them, at that time, which afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into a law, for the payment of the remaining debts of the government, amount|ing to many thou&s;and pounds; in which, after a recital of
<PB N="158" REF="024800_0153_0FCD63928DF7F168">the general rea&s;ons, for a&s;certaining the limits between New-York and New-Jer&s;ey on the one &s;ide, and Connecti|cut on the other, a clau&s;e was added, to defray the expen&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ervices. Seven hundred and fifty ounces of plate were enacted "to be i&s;&s;ued by warrant, under the hand and &s;eal of the governor of this province for the time being, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of his maje&s;ty's council, in &s;uch parts and portions as &s;hall be requi&s;ite for that &s;ervice, when the &s;urvey, a&s;certaining, and running the &s;aid line, limit, and boundary, &s;hall be begun, and carried on, by the mutual con&s;ent and agreement of his excellency and coun|cil of this province, and the proprietors of the &s;oil of the &s;aid province of New-Jer&s;ey." According to this law, the line "agreed on by the &s;urveyors and commi&s;&s;ioners of each colony was to be conclu&s;ive." Another &s;um was al&s;o provided by the &s;ame clau&s;e, for running the line between New-York and Connecticut; and in the year, 1719, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;ettlement of that limit, of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice in a &s;ucceeding admini&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Whether it was becau&s;e mr. Nicoll was di&s;gu&s;ted with the governor's prevailing intere&s;t in the hou&s;e, or to his infirm &s;tate of health, that he de&s;ired, by a letter to the general a&s;&s;embly, on the 18th of May, 1718, to be di&s;charg|ed from the &s;peaker's place, is uncertain. His reque&s;t was readily granted, and Robert Living&s;ton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> cho&s;en in his &s;tead. The concord between the governor and this a&s;&s;embly, was now wound up to its highe&s;t pitch. In&s;tead of other evi|dences of it, I &s;hall lay before the reader his la&s;t &s;peech to the hou&s;e on the 24th of June 1719, and their addre&s;s in an&s;wer to it.</P>

<P>I have now &s;ent for you, that you may be witne&s;&s;es to my a&s;&s;ent to the acts pa&s;&s;ed by the general a&s;&s;embly in this &s;e&s;&s;ion. I hope that what remains unfini&s;hed, may be per|fected by to-morrow, when I intend to put a clo&s;e to this &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity al&s;o to acquaint you, that my late uncertain &s;tate of health, the care of my little family, and my private affairs, on the other &s;ide, have at la&s;t de|termined me, to make u&s;e of that licen&s;e of ab&s;ence, which has been &s;ome time ago &s;o graciou&s;ly granted me; but with a firm re&s;olution to return to you again, if it is his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure that I &s;hould do &s;o: but if that proves otherwi&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you that whil&s;t I live, I &s;hall be watchful and indu&s;|trious

<P>Colonel Morris and the new &s;peaker were the authors of the an&s;wer to this &s;peech, though it was &s;igned by all the members. Whether mr. Hunter de&s;erved the eulogium they be&s;towed upon him, I leave the reader to determine. It is certain that few plantation governors have the honour to carry home with them &s;uch a te&s;timonial as this:</P>
<P>"Sir, when we reflect upon your pa&s;t conduct, your ju&s;t, mild, and tender admini&s;tration, it heightens the concern we have for your departure, and makes our grief &s;uch as words cannot truly expre&s;s. You have governed well and wi&s;ely, like a prudent magi&s;trate, like an affectionate parent; and wherever you go, and whatever &s;tation the divine pro|vidence &s;hall plea&s;e to a&s;&s;ign you, our &s;incere de&s;ires and prayers for the happine&s;s of you and yours, &s;hall always at|tend you.</P>
<P>"We have &s;een many governors, and may &s;ee more; and as none of tho&s;e, who had the honour to &s;erve in your &s;ta|tion, were ever &s;o ju&s;tly fixed in the affections of the go|verned, &s;o tho&s;e to come will acquire no mean reputation, when it can be &s;aid of them, their conduct has been like yours.</P>
<P>"We thankfully accept the honour you do us, in calling your&s;elf our countryman: give us leave then to de&s;ire, that you will not forget this as your country, and, if you can, make ha&s;te to return to it.</P>
<P>"But if the &s;ervice of our &s;overeign will not admit of what we &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ire, and his commands deny us that happine&s;s; permit us to addre&s;s you as our friend, and give
<PB N="160" REF="024800_0155_0FCD63970EE606A0">us your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when we are oppre&s;&s;ed with an admini&s;|tration the rever&s;e of yours."</P>
<P>Colonel Hunter departing the province, the chief com|mand devolved, the 31&s;t of July, 1719, on Peter Schuyler, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> then the elde&s;t member of the board of council. As he had no interview with the a&s;&s;embly during his &s;hort ad|mini&s;tration, in which he behaved with great moderation and integrity; there is very little ob&s;ervable in his time, except a treaty, at Albany, with the Indians, for confirming the antient league; and the tran&s;actions re&s;pecting the par|tition line between this and the colony of New-Jer&s;ey: concerning the latter of which, I &s;hall now lay before the reader a very &s;ummary account.</P>
<P>The two provinces were originally included in the grant of king Charles to the duke of York. New-Jer&s;ey was after|wards conveyed by the duke to lord Berkley and &s;ir George Carteret. This again, by adeed of partition, was divided into Ea&s;t and We&s;t Jer&s;ey, the former being relea&s;ed to &s;ir George Carteret, and the latter to the a&s;&s;igns of lord Berkley. The line of divi&s;ion extended from little Egg harbour to the north partition point on Delaware river; and thus both tho&s;e tracts became concerned in the limits of the province of New-York. The original rights of lord Berkley and &s;ir George Carteret, are ve&s;ted in two different &s;ets, con&s;i&s;ting each of a great number of per&s;ons, known by the general name of the proprietors of Ea&s;t and We&s;t Jer&s;ey, who, though they &s;urrendered the powers of government to queen Anne, in the year 1702, &s;till retained their property in the &s;oil. The&s;e were the per&s;ons intere&s;ted again&s;t the claim of New-York. It is agreed on all &s;ides, that the deed to New-Jer&s;ey is to be fir&s;t &s;atisfied, out of that great tract granted to the duke, and that the remainder is the right of New-York. The proprietors in&s;i&s;t upon extending their northern limits to a line drawn from the latitude of 41&deg; 40&prime; on Delaware, to the latitude of 41&deg;, on Hud&s;on's river; and allege, that before the year 1671, the latitude of 41&deg;, was reputed to be fourteen miles to the northward of Tappan creek, part of tho&s;e lands being &s;ettled under New-Jer&s;ey till 1684. They farther contend, that in 1684 or 1685, Dongan and Lawrie, (the former, governor of New-York, and the latter, of New-Jer&s;ey), with their re&s;pective councils, agreed, that the latitude on Hud&s;on's river was at the mouth of Tappan creek, and that a line from thence to the latitude of 41&deg; 40&prime; on Delaware &s;hould be the boundary line. In 1686, Robin|&s;on
<PB N="161" REF="024800_0156_0FCD6398C5048FA8">Wells, and Keith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame who left the quakers, and took orders in the church of England. Burnet's hi&s;t. of his own times.</NOTE> &s;urveyors of the three &s;everal pro|vinces, took two ob&s;ervations, and found the latitude of 41&deg; to be 1&prime; and 25&prime; to the northward of the Yonker's mills, which is four miles and forty five chains to the &s;outhward of the month of Tappan creek. But again&s;t the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions the proprietors offer &s;undry objections, which it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enumerate. It is not pretended by any of the litigants, that a line, according to the &s;tations &s;ettled by Dongan and Lawrie, was actually run; &s;o that the limits of the&s;e contending provinces, mu&s;t long have exi&s;ted in the uncertain conjectures of the inhabitants of both; and yet the inconveniences of this un&s;ettled &s;tate, through the in|fancy of the country, were very incon&s;iderable. In the year 1701, an act pa&s;&s;ed in New-York, relating to elections, which annexed Wagachemeck, and great and little Mini|&s;ink, certain &s;ettlements near Delaware, to Ul&s;ter county. The intent of this law was to quiet di&s;putes before &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between the inhabitants of tho&s;e places, who&s;e votes were required both in Orange and Ul&s;ter. The natural con|clu&s;ion from hence is, that the legi&s;lature of New-York then deemed tho&s;e plantations not included within the New-Jer&s;ey grant.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of this affair till the year 1717, when provi&s;ion was made by this province for running the line. The &s;ame being done in New-Jer&s;ey the &s;ucceeding year, commi&s;&s;ions for that purpo&s;e, under the great &s;eals of the re|&s;pective colonies, were i&s;&s;ued in May, 1719. The commi&s;|&s;ioners, by indenture dated the 25th of July, fixed the north &s;tation point on the northermo&s;t branch of Delaware, call|ed the Fi&s;h-Kill; and from thence a random line was run to Hud&s;on's river, terminating about five miles to the north|ward of the mouth of Tappan creek. In Augu&s;t, the &s;ur|veyors of Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey met for fixing the &s;tation on Hud&s;on's river. All the commi&s;&s;ioners not attending through &s;ick|ne&s;s, nothing further was done. What had already been tran&s;acted, however, gave a general alarm to many per&s;ons intere&s;ted in &s;everal patents under New-York, who before imagined their rights extended to the &s;outhward of the random line. The New-York &s;urveyor afterwards declined proceeding in the work, complaining of faults in the in&s;tru|ment, which had been u&s;ed in fixing the north &s;tation on Delaware. The proprietors, on the other hand, think they
<PB N="162" REF="024800_0157_0FCD639A0C4042D0">have an&s;wered his objections, and the matter re&s;ted, with|out much contention, till the year 1740. Frequent quarrels multiplying after that period, relating to the rights of &s;oil and juri&s;diction &s;outhward of the line in 1719, a proba|tionary act was pa&s;&s;ed in New-Jer&s;ey, in February, 1748, for running the line <HI>ex parte,</HI> if the province of New-York refu&s;ed to join in the work. Our a&s;&s;embly, &s;oon after, di|rected their agent, to oppo&s;e the king's confirmation of that act; and it was accordingly dropped, agreeably to the advice of the lords of trade, who&s;e report of the 18th of July, 1753, on a matter of &s;o much importance, will doubtle&s;s be acceptable to the reader.</P>

<HEAD>To the KING'S mo&s;t excellent maje&s;ty:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your maje&s;ty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have lately had under our con&s;ideration, an act pa&s;&s;ed in your maje&s;ty's province of New-Jer&s;ey in 1747-8, entitled, 'An act for running and a&s;certaining the line of partition and divi&s;ion betwixt this province of New-Jer&s;ey, and the province of New-York.'</P>
<P>And having been attended by mr. Paris, &s;olicitor in be|half of the proprietors of the ea&s;tern divi&s;ion of New-Jer&s;ey&mdash;with mr. Hume Campbell, and mr. Henley, his coun&s;el, in &s;upport of the &s;aid act&mdash;and by mr. Charles, agent for the province of New-York, with mr. Forre&s;ter, and mr. Pratt, his coun&s;el, again&s;t the &s;aid act; and heard what each party had to offer thereupon; we beg leave humbly to re|pre&s;ent to your maje&s;ty, that the con&s;iderations which ari&s;e upon this act, are of two &s;orts, viz. &s;uch as relate to the principles upon which it is founded, and &s;uch as relate to the tran&s;actions and circum&s;tances which accompany it.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t; it is an act of the province of New-Jer|&s;ey, intere&s;ted in the determination of the limits, and in the con&s;equential advantages to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>The province of New-Jer&s;ey, in its di&s;tinct and &s;epa|rate capacity, can neither make nor e&s;tabli&s;h boundaries: it can as little pre&s;cribe regulations for deciding differences between it&s;elf and other parties concerned in intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed limits of its juri&s;diction and territory, are &s;uch as the grants under which it claims have a&s;&s;igned. If tho&s;e grants are doubtful, and differences ari&s;e upon the con&s;tructions, or upon the matters of them, we humbly ap|prehend that there are but two methods of deciding them; either by the concurrence of all parties concerned in in|tere&s;t, or by the regular and legal forms of judicial pro|ceedings:
<PB N="163" REF="024800_0158_0FCD639EB8CD7D18">and it appears to us, that the method of pro|ceeding mu&s;t be derived from the immediate authority of the crown it&s;elf, &s;ignified by a commi&s;&s;ion from your ma|je&s;ty under the great &s;eal: the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ubordinate officers and of derivative powers being neither competent nor adequate to &s;uch purpo&s;es: to judge otherwi&s;e would be, as we humbly conceive, to &s;et up <HI>ex parte</HI> determinations and incompetent juri&s;dictions in the place of ju&s;tice and legal authority.</P>
<P>If the act of New-Jer&s;ey cannot conclude other parties, it cannot be effectual to the ends propo&s;ed; and that it would not be effectual to form an ab&s;olute deci&s;ion in this ca&s;e, the legi&s;lature of that province &s;eems &s;en&s;ible, whil&s;t it endeavours to leave to your maje&s;ty's determination, the deci&s;ion of one point relative to this matter, and of con|&s;iderable importance to it; which power your maje&s;ty can|not derive from them, without their having the power to e&s;tabli&s;h the thing it&s;elf, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of your ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>As we are of opinion, that the pre&s;ent act, without the concurrence of other parties concerned in intere&s;t, is un|warrantable and ineffectual; we &s;hall, in the next place, con&s;ider what tran&s;actions and proceedings have pa&s;&s;ed, to|wards obtaining &s;uch concurrence.</P>
<P>The parties intere&s;ted are your maje&s;ty and the two provinces of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey. Your maje&s;ty is intere&s;ted with re&s;pect to your &s;overeignty, &s;eigneurie, and property; and the &s;aid provinces with re&s;pect to their go|vernment and juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>With regard to the tran&s;actions on the part of New-York, we beg leave to ob&s;erve, that whatever agreements have been made formerly between the two provinces for &s;ettling their boundaries; whatever acts of a&s;&s;embly have pa&s;&s;ed, and whatever commi&s;&s;ions have been i&s;&s;ued by the re&s;pective governors and governments; the proceedings under them have never been perfected, the work remains unfini&s;hed, and the di&s;putes between the two provinces &s;ub|&s;i&s;t with as much contradiction as ever, but there is a cir|cum&s;tance that appears to us to have &s;till more weight, namely, that tho&s;e tran&s;actions were never properly war|ranted on the part of the crown: the crown never partici|pated in them, and therefore cannot be bound with re&s;pect to its intere&s;ts by proceedings &s;o authorized.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t, which your maje&s;ty has in the determi|nation of this boundary, may be con&s;idered in three lights: either as intere&s;ts of &s;overeignty, re&s;pecting mere govern|ment;
<PB N="164" REF="024800_0159_0FCD63A05D183630">of &s;eigneurie, which re&s;pect e&s;cheats, and quit-rents; or of property, as relative to the &s;oil it&s;elf; which la&s;t in|tere&s;t, takes place in &s;uch ca&s;es, where either your maje&s;ty has never made any grants of the &s;oil, or where &s;uch grants have by e&s;cheats reverted to your maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e intere&s;ts, viz. that of &s;overeignty, it has been alleged to us, in &s;upport of the act, that it is not materially affected by the que&s;tion, as both provinces are under your maje&s;ty's immediate direction and government: but they &s;tand in a very different light with re|&s;pect to your maje&s;ty's intere&s;t in the quit-rents and e&s;|cheats; in both which articles the &s;ituation of the two pro|vinces appears to us to make a very material alteration: for although the province of New-Jer&s;ey is not under regula|tions of propriety or charter with re&s;pect to its government, yet it is a proprietary province, with re&s;pect to the grant and tenure of its territory: and con&s;equently as New-York is not in that predicament, the determination of the bounda|ry, in prejudice to that province, will affect your maje&s;ty's intere&s;t with re&s;pect to the tenure of &s;uch lands as are con|cerned in this que&s;tion: it being evident, that whatever di&s;tricts are &s;uppo&s;ed to be included in the limits of New-Jer&s;ey, will immediately pa&s;s to the proprietors of that pro|vince, and be held of them, by which means your maje&s;ty would be deprived of your e&s;cheats, and the quit-rents would pa&s;s into other hands.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, it has been alleged, that the crown has already made ab&s;olute grants of the whole terri|tory that can po&s;&s;ibly come in que&s;tion under the denomi|nation of this boundary, and re&s;erved only trifling and in|con&s;iderable quit-rents on tho&s;e grants. But this argument does not &s;eem to us to be conclu&s;ive, &s;ince it admits an inter|e&s;t in your maje&s;ty, the greatne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of which is merely accidental; and therefore does not affect the e&s;&s;ence of the que&s;tion: and we beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in the ca&s;e of exorbitant grants with incon&s;iderable quit-rents&mdash;and where con&s;equently it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the crown has been deceived in &s;uch grants by its officers; your maje&s;ty's contingent right of property, in virtue of your &s;eigneurie, &s;eems rather to be enlarged than dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it appears to us, that governor Hanter ought not to have i&s;&s;ued his commi&s;&s;ion for running the line above mentioned, without having previou&s;ly re|ceived the loyal direction and in&s;truction for that purpo&s;e; and that a commi&s;&s;ion, i&s;&s;ued without &s;uch authority, can
<PB N="165" REF="024800_0160_0FCD63A195B5ADA0">be con&s;idered, with re&s;pect to the intere&s;ts of the crown, in no other light than as a mere nullity: and even with re&s;pect to New-York, we ob&s;erve, that the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion is que&s;|tionable, as it does not follow the directions of the above|mentioned act, pa&s;&s;ed in 1717, which declares, that the commi&s;&s;ion to be i&s;&s;ued, &s;hall be granted under the joint authority of the governor and council of that province.</P>
<P>But it has been further urged, that the crown has &s;ince confirmed the&s;e tran&s;actions, either by previous declarati|ons or by &s;ub&s;equent acquie&s;cence, and con&s;equently parti|cipated in them, &s;o far as to conclude it&s;elf: we &s;hall there|fore, in the next place, beg leave to con&s;ider the circum|&s;tances urged for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been alleged, that the crown, by giving con&s;ent to the afore&s;aid act, pa&s;&s;ed in New-York in 1717, for pay|ing and di&s;charging &s;everal debts due from that colony, &amp;c. concluded and bound it&s;elf, with re&s;pect to the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings had under the commi&s;&s;ion i&s;&s;ued by governor Hunter: but the view and purport of that act appears to us &s;o entire, and &s;o di&s;tinctly formed for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing money and e&s;tabli&s;hing funds&mdash;&s;o various and &s;o di&s;|tinct from any con&s;ideration of the di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the two provinces, with re&s;pect to the boundaries&mdash;that we cannot conceive a &s;ingle clau&s;e, in &s;o long and &s;o intricate an act, can be a &s;ufficient foundation to warrant the pro|ceedings of governor Hunter &s;ub&s;equent to it, without a &s;pecial authority from the crown for that purpo&s;e: and there is the more rea&s;on to be of this opinion, as the crown, by giving its a&s;&s;ent to that act, can be con&s;trued to have a&s;|&s;ented only to the levying money for a future purpo&s;e; which purpo&s;e could not be effected by any commi&s;&s;ion, but from it&s;elf; and therefore can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, thereby, approved a commi&s;&s;ion from another authority, which was at that time already i&s;&s;ued, and carrying in exe|cution, previous to &s;uch a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We further beg leave humbly to repre&s;ent to your maje&s;ty, that the line of partition and divi&s;ion between your maje&s;ty's province of New-York and colony of Connec|ticut, having been run and a&s;certained, pur&s;uant to the di|rections of an act, pa&s;&s;ed at New-York, for that purpo&s;e, in the year 1719, and confirmed by his late maje&s;ty in 1723; the tran&s;actions between the &s;aid province and colony, upon that occa&s;ion, have been alleged to be &s;imilar to, and urg|ed as, a precedent, and even as an approbation, of the mat|ter now in que&s;tion: but we are humbly of opinion, that the two ca&s;es are materially and e&s;&s;entially different. The
<PB N="166" REF="024800_0161_0FCD63A30C326FC0">act pa&s;&s;ed in New-York, in 1719, for running and a&s;certain|ing the lines of partition and divi&s;ion between that colony and the colony of Connecticut, recites, that in the year 1683, the governor and council of New-York, and the go|vernor and commi&s;&s;ioners of Connecticut, did, in council, conclude an agreement concerning the boundaries of the two provinces; that, in con&s;equence of this agreement, commi&s;&s;ioners and &s;urveyors were appointed on the part of each government, who did actually agree, determine, and a&s;certain, the lines of partition: marked out a certain part of them, and fixed the point from whence the remaining part &s;hould be run: that the &s;everal things agreed on and done by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners, were ratified by the re|&s;pective governors&mdash;entered on record in each colony, in March 1700&mdash;approved and confirmed by order of king William, the third, in his privy council&mdash;and by his &s;aid maje&s;ty's letter to his governor of New-York. From this recital it appears to us, that tho&s;e tran&s;actions were not on|ly carried on with the participation, but confirmed by the expre&s;s act and authority of the crown; and that confirma|tion made the foundation of the act, pa&s;&s;ed by New-York, for &s;ettling the boundaries between the two provinces; of all which authority and foundation, the act, we now lay before your maje&s;ty, appears to us to be entirely de&s;titute.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as it appears to us, that the act in que&s;tion, cannot be effectual to the ends propo&s;ed&mdash;that your maje&s;ty's intere&s;t may be materially affected by it&mdash; and that the proceedings, on which it is founded, were not warranted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by the proper authority, but carried on without the participation of the crown; we cannot think it advi&s;able, to lay this act before your maje&s;|ty, as fit to receive your royal approbation.</P>

<P>Mr. Burnet was a &s;on of the celebrated bi&s;hop of that name, who&s;e piety and crudition, but e&s;pecially his zeal and activity, for the glorious revolution and prote&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, will embalm his memory to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages. The governor was a man of &s;en&s;e and polite breeding, a well-read &s;cholar, &s;prightly, and of a &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition. Being devoted to his books, he ab&s;tained from all tho&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es, into which his plea&s;urable reli&s;h would otherwi&s;e have plunged him. He &s;tudied the arts of recommending him&s;elf to the people, had nothing of the moro&s;ene&s;s of a &s;cholar, was gay and conde&s;cending, affected no pomp, but
<PB N="168" REF="024800_0163_0FCD63A990BA0350">vi&s;ited every family of reputation, and often diverted him|&s;elf in free conver&s;e with the ladies, by whom he was very much admired. No governor, before him, did &s;o much bu&s;i|ne&s;s in chancery. The office of chancellor was his delight. He made a tolerable figure in the exerci&s;e of it, though he was no lawyer, and had a foible very un&s;uitable for a judge I mean his re&s;olving too &s;peedily, for he u&s;ed to &s;ay of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;elf, "I act fir&s;t, and think afterwards." He &s;poke, how|ever, always &s;en&s;ibly, and by his great reading was able to make a literary parade.&mdash;As to his fortune, it was very in|con&s;iderable, for he &s;uffered much in the &s;outh &s;ea &s;cheme. While in England, he had the office of comptroller of the cu&s;toms at London, which he re&s;igned to brigadier Hunter, as the latter, in his favour, did the government of this and the colony of New-Jer&s;ey. Mr. Burnet's acquaintance with that gentleman gave him a fine opportunity, before his ar|rival, to obtain good intelligence both of per&s;ons and things. The brigadier recommended all his old friends to the favour of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and hence we find that he made few changes among&s;t them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel Schuyler and mr. Philip&s;e were, indeed, re|moved from the council board, by his repre&s;entations; and their oppo&s;ing, in council, the continuance of the a&s;&s;embly, after his arrival, was the cau&s;e of it.</NOTE>. Mr. Morris, the chief ju&s;tice, was his principal confidant. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander, two Scotch gentlemen, had the next place in his e&s;teem. He &s;howed his wi&s;dom in that choice, for they were both men of learning, good morals, and &s;olid parts. The former was well acquainted with the affairs of the province, and particularly tho&s;e which concerned the French in Canada and our Indian allies. The latter was bred to the law; and though no &s;peaker, at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion for &s;agaci|ty and penetration; and in application to bu&s;ine&s;s) no man could &s;urpa&s;s him. Nor was he unacquainted with the affairs of the public, having &s;erved in the &s;ecretary's office, the be&s;t &s;chool in the province, for in&s;truction in matters of government; becau&s;e the &s;ecretary enjoys a plurality of offices, conver&s;ant with the fir&s;t &s;prings of our provincial economy. Both tho&s;e gentlemen mr. Burnet &s;oon rai&s;ed to the council board, as he al&s;o did mr. Morris, jun. mr. Van Horn, who&s;e daughter he married, and mr. Kennedy, who &s;ucceeded Byerly, both at the council board, and in the of|fice of receiver-general.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="024800_0164_0FCD63AA8E8F2470">
Of all our governors, none had &s;uch exten&s;ive and ju&s;t views of our Indian affairs, and the dangerous neighbour|hood of the French, as governor Burnet, in which mr. Li|ving&s;ton was his principal a&s;&s;i&s;tant. His attention to the&s;e matters appeared at the very commencement of his admini&s;|tration; for in his fir&s;t &s;peech to the a&s;&s;embly, the very fall after his arrival, he laboured to implant the &s;ame &s;enti|ments in the brea&s;ts of the members; endeavouring to a|larm their fears, by the daily advances of the French, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the main pa&s;&s;es, &s;educing our Indian allies, and encrea&s;ing their new &s;ettlements in Loui&s;ania.</P>
<P>Chief ju&s;tice Morris, who&s;e influence was very great in the hou&s;e, drew the addre&s;s in an&s;wer to the governor's &s;peech, which contained a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age manife&s;ting the confi|dence they repo&s;ed in him. "We believe that the &s;on of that worthy prelate, &s;o eminently in&s;trumental, under our glo|rious monarch, William the third, in delivering us from arbitrary power, and its concomitants, popery, &s;uper&s;ti|tion and &s;lavery; has been educated in, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, tho&s;e principles, that &s;o ju&s;tly recommended his father to the council and confidence of prote&s;tant princes; and &s;uc|ceeds our former governor, not only in power, but inclina|tion to do us good."</P>
<P>From an a&s;&s;embly, impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch favourable &s;enti|ments, his excellency had the highe&s;t rea&s;on, to expect a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive compliance, with every thing recommended to their notice. The public bu&s;ine&s;s proceeded without &s;u&s;pi|cion or jealou&s;y, and nothing intervened to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the political &s;tate. Among the mo&s;t remark|able acts, pa&s;&s;ed at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, we may reckon that, for a five years &s;upport; another for laying a duty of two per cent. prime co&s;t, on the importation of European goods, which was &s;oon after repealed by the king; and a third, for prohibiting the &s;ale of Indian goods to the French. The la&s;t of the&s;e was a favourite act of the governor's, and though a law very advantageous to the province, became the &s;ource of an unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, which continued through his whole admini&s;tration. From the conclu&s;ion of the peace of Utrecht, a great trade was carried on between Albany and Canada, for goods &s;aleable among the Indians. The chiefs of the confederates wi&s;ely fore&s;aw its ill con&s;equences, and complained of it to the commi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The governor's re&s;iding at New York, rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould be commi&s;&s;ioned, at Alba|ny, to receive intelligence from the Indians, and treat with them upon emergencies. This gave ri&s;e to the office of com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs, who in general tran&s;act all &s;uch matters as might be done by the governor. They receive no &s;alaries, but con&s;iderable &s;ums are depo&s;ited in their hands for occa&s;ional pre&s;ents. There are regular minutes of their tran&s;actions from the year 1675. The&s;e were in &s;eparate quires, till mr. Alexander, who borrowed them for his peru&s;al in 1751, had them bound up in four large volumes in folio. Here all our Indian treaties are entered. The books are kept by a &s;ecretary, commi&s;&s;ioned in Eng|land, who&s;e appointment is an annual &s;alary of one hundred pounds proclamation out of the quit-rents. The command|ant at O&s;wego is generally a commi&s;&s;ioner. The office would probably have been more advantageous than it has been, if the commi&s;&s;ioners were not traders them&s;elves, than which nothing is more ignoble in the judgment of the Indians. Sir William John&s;on is at pre&s;ent the &s;ole commi&s;|&s;ioner, and within nine months after the arrival of gene|ral Braddock, received 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling to &s;ecure the Indi|an intere&s;t.</NOTE>, who wrote to mr. Hunter,
<PB N="170" REF="024800_0165_0FCD63AC38501B70">acquainting him of their di&s;&s;atisfaction. The letter was laid before the hou&s;e; but no effectual &s;tep taken to pre|vent the mi&s;chief, till the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, which &s;ub|jected the traders to a forfeiture of the effects &s;old, and the penalty of one hundred pounds. Mr. Burnet's &s;cheme was to draw the Indian trade into our own hands; to ob&s;truct the communication of the French with our allies, which gave them frequent opportunities of &s;educing them from their fidelity; and to regain the Caghnuagas, who became intere&s;ted in their di&s;affection, by being the carriers be|tween Albany and Montreal. Among tho&s;e who were more immediately prejudiced by this new regulation, the im|porters of tho&s;e goods, from Europe, were the chief; and hence the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring of their oppo&s;ition to the governor.</P>
<P>All po&s;&s;ible arts were u&s;ed, both here and at home, to pre&s;erve the good temper of the a&s;&s;embly. Brigadier Hunter gave the mini&s;try &s;uch favourable accounts of the members, that colonel Schuyler, during his pre&s;ident&s;hip, had orders from mr. &s;ecretary Craggs, neither to di&s;&s;olve them him|&s;elf, nor permit them to be di&s;&s;olved; and at the &s;pring &s;e&s;&s;ion, in the year 1721, mr. Burnet informed them, that his continuance of them, was highly approved at home.
<PB N="171" REF="024800_0166_0FCD63AD8D15C6F8">Horatio Walpole, the auditor-general, who had appointed mr. Clarke for his deputy, thought this a favourable con|juncture, for procuring five per cent. out of the trea&s;ury. But the hou&s;e was aver&s;e to his application; and on the 2d of June, Abcaham Depey&s;ter, jun. was appointed trea|&s;urer by the &s;peaker's warrant, with the con&s;ent of the go|vernor, in the room of his father, who was infirm; upon which he entered into a recognizance of 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the king, before a judge of the &s;upreme court, for the faithful execution of his tru&s;t, which was lodged in the &s;ecretary's office. The hou&s;e at the &s;ame time, in an addre&s;s, declared their willingne&s;s that the trea&s;urer &s;hould account; but utterly refu&s;ed to admit of any drafts upon the trea&s;u|ry, for the auditor-general, who was con&s;trained to de|pend entirely upon the revenue, out of which he received about 200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P>Mr. Burnet being well acquainted with the geography of the country, wi&s;ely concluded, that it was to the la&s;t de|gree nece&s;&s;ary to get the command of the great lake Onta|rio, as well for the benefit of the trade, and the &s;ecurity of the friend&s;hip of the five nations, as to fru&s;trate the French de&s;igns, of confining the Engli&s;h colonies to narrow limits, along the &s;ea coa&s;t, by a chain of forts on the great pa&s;&s;es from Canada to Loui&s;ania. Towards the &s;ubver&s;ion of this &s;cheme, he began the erection of a trading hou&s;e at O&s;we|go, in the county of the Senecas, in 1722; and recom|mended a provi&s;ion for the re&s;idence of tru&s;ty per&s;ons a|mong them, and the Onondagas, which la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the cen|tre of the five cantons. This year was remarkable for a con|gre&s;s of &s;everal governors and commi&s;&s;ioners, on the renew|al of the ancient friend&s;hip with the Indians at Albany, Mr. Burnet prevailed upon them to &s;end a me&s;&s;age, to threaten the ea&s;tern Indians with a war, unle&s;s they concluded a peace with the Engli&s;h, who were very much harra&s;&s;ed by their frequent irruptions. On the 20th of May, in the year following, the confederates were augmented by their reception of above eighty Nicariagas, be&s;ides women and children, as they had been formerly, by the addition of the Tu&s;caroras. The country of the Nicariagas was on the north &s;ide of Mi&s;&s;ilimakinack; but the Tu&s;caroras po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tract of land near the &s;ources of James's river, in Virginia, from whence the encroachments of the Engli&s;h induced them to remove, and &s;ettle near the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the Oneyda lake.</P>
<P>The &s;trict union &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, between the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature, gave a handle to mr. Burnet's enemies to ex|cite
<PB N="172" REF="024800_0167_0FCD63B2A55AAEE0">a clamour again&s;t him. Jealou&s;ies were indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;own in the brea&s;ts of the people. The continuance of an a&s;&s;embly, after the acce&s;&s;ion of a new governor, was repre&s;ented as an anti-con&s;titutional project: and though the affairs of the pub|lic were conducted with wi&s;dom and &s;pirit, many were &s;o much impo&s;ed upon, that a rupture between the governor and the a&s;&s;embly was thought to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the weal and &s;afety of the community. But this was not the on|ly &s;tratagem of tho&s;e who were di&s;affected by the prohi|bition of the French trade. The London merchants were induced to petition the king for an order to his governor, prohibiting the revival of the act made again&s;t it, or the pa&s;&s;ing any new law of that tendency. The petition was referred to the board of trade, and backed before their lord|&s;hips, with &s;ugge&s;tions of the mo&s;t notorious fal&s;ehoods. The lords of trade prudently advi&s;ed, that no &s;uch direc|tions &s;hould be &s;ent to mr. Burnet, till he had an opportuni|ty of an&s;wering the objections again&s;t the act. They were accordingly &s;ent over to him, and he laid them before his council. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander exerted them&s;elves in a memorable report in an&s;wer to them, which drew upon them the re&s;entment of &s;everal merchants here, who had fir&s;t excited the London petition, and laid the foun|dation for a variance between their families, which has manife&s;ted it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions. In ju&s;tice to mr. Bur|not's memory, and to &s;how the propriety of his mea&s;ures for ob&s;tructing the French trade, I cannot refrain the re|publication of the council's report at full length.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your excellency's commands, in council, the 29th of October, referring to us a petition of &s;e|veral merchants in London, pre&s;ented to the king's mo&s;t excellent maje&s;ty, again&s;t renewing an act pa&s;&s;ed in this province, entitled, "An act for encouragement of the In|dian trade, and rendering it more effectual to the inhabi|tants of this province, and for prohibiting the &s;elling of In|dian goods to the French:" as likewi&s;e the &s;everal allega|tions of the &s;aid merchants before the right honourable the lords of trade and plantations, we beg leave to make the following remarks.</P>
<P>In order to make our ob&s;ervations the more di&s;tinct and clear, we &s;hall gather together the &s;everal a&s;&s;ertions of the &s;aid merchants, both in their petition, and delivered ver|bally before the lords of trade, as to the &s;ituation of this province, with re&s;pect to the French and Indian nations;
<PB N="173" REF="024800_0168_0FCD63B38D0B91B0">and ob&s;erve on them, in the fir&s;t place, they being the foundation on which all their other allegations are ground|ed. Afterwards we &s;hall lay before your excellency, what we think nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, on the other parts of the &s;aid petition, in the order they are in the petition, or in the re|port of the lords of trade.</P>
<P>In their geographical accounts they &s;ay, "Be&s;ides the nations of Indians that are in the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, there are very many nations of Indians, who are at pre&s;ent in the intere&s;t of the French, and who lie between New York and the nations of Indians in the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. The French and their Indians would not permit the Engli&s;h In|dians to pa&s;s over by their forts." The &s;aid act "re&s;trains them (the five nations) from a free commerce with the in|habitants of New York."</P>
<P>The five Indian nations are &s;ettled upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, directly oppo&s;ite to Quebec, two or three hundred leagues di&s;tant from the neare&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in New York."</P>
<P>They (the five nations of Indians) were two or three hundred leagues di&s;tant from Albany; and that they could not come to trade with the Engli&s;h, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and from thence through a lake, which brought them within eighteen leagues of Albany."</P>
<P>The&s;e things the merchants have thought it &s;afe for them, and con&s;i&s;tent with their duty to his &s;acred maje&s;ty, to &s;ay in his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, and to repeat them after|wards before the right honourable the lords of trade, though nothing can be more directly contrary to the truth. For there are no nations of Indians between New York and the nations of Indians in the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, who are now &s;ix in number, by the addition of the Tu&s;caroras. The Mohawks (called Annies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agnies.</NOTE> by the French) one of the five nations, live on the &s;outh &s;ide of a branch of Hud&s;on's ri|ver, (not on the north &s;ide, as they are placed in the French maps) and but forty miles directly we&s;t from Albany, and within the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements; &s;ome of the Engli&s;h farms, upon the &s;ame river, being thirty miles further we&s;t. The Oneydas (the next of the five nations) lie like|wi&s;e we&s;t from Albany, near the head of the Mohawk's ri|ver, about one hundred miles from Albany. The Ononda|gas lie about one hundred and thirty miles we&s;t from Al|bany; and the Tu&s;caroras live partly with the Oneydas, and
<PB N="174" REF="024800_0169_0FCD63B50D47D378">partly with the Onondagas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De L'I&s;le.</NOTE>. The Cayugas are about one hundred and &s;ixty miles from Albany; and the Senecas, (the furthe&s;t of all the&s;e nations,) are not above two hun|dred and forty miles from Albany, as may appear from mr. de L'I&s;le's map of Loui&s;ania, who lays down the five nations under the name of Iroquois: and goods are daily carried, from this province, to the Senecas, as well as to tho&s;e nations that lie nearer, by water, all the way, except three miles (or, in the dry &s;ea&s;ons, five miles) where the traders carry over land between the Mohawk's river and the Wood creek, which runs into the Oneyda's lake, without going near either St. Lawrenceriver, or any of the lakes upon which the French pa&s;s, which are entirely out of their way.</P>
<P>The neare&s;t French forts, or &s;ettlements, to Albany, are Chambly, and Montreal, both of them lying about north and by ea&s;t from Albany, and are near two hundred miles di&s;tant from it. Quebec lies about three hundred and eighty miles north-ea&s;t from Albany. So far is it from being true, that the five nations are &s;ituated upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, oppo&s;ite to Quebec, that Albany lies almo&s;t directly between Quebec and the five nations. And to &s;ay that the&s;e Indians cannot come to trade at Al|bany, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and then into a lake eighteen leagues from Albany (we &s;uppo&s;e they mean lake Champlain) pa&s;&s;ing by the French forts, is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as if they &s;hould &s;ay, that one cannot go from London to Bri&s;tol, but way of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Before we go on to ob&s;erve other particulars, we beg leave further to remark, that it is &s;o far from being true, that the Indians in the French intere&s;t, lie between New-York and our five nations of Indians; that &s;ome of our nations of Indians lie between the French and the Indians, from whence the French bring the far greate&s;t quantity of their furs: for the Senecas (whom the French call Sonon|touons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;onnontouans.</NOTE>) are &s;ituated between lake Erie and Cadaracqui lake, (called by the French, Ontario) near the great fall of Iagara<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sometimes Oniagara, Ochniagara, but commonly Nia|gara.</NOTE>, by which all the Indians that live round lake Erie, round the lake of the Hurons, round the lake of the Illinois, or Michegan, and round the great upper lake,
<PB N="175" REF="024800_0170_0FCD63B68E749790">generally pa&s;s in their way to Canada. All the Indians &s;itu|ated upon the branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, mu&s;t likewi&s;e pa&s;s by the &s;ame place, if they go to Canada. And all of them, likewi&s;e, in their way to Canada, pa&s;s by our trad|ing-place upon the Cadaracqui lake, at the mouth of the Onondaga river. The neare&s;t and &s;afe&s;t way of carrying goods upon the Cadaracqui lake, towards Canada, being along the &s;outh &s;ide of that lake, (near where our Indians are &s;ettled, and our trade of late is fixed) and not by the north &s;ide and Cadaracqui, or Frontenac fort, where the French are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Now that we have repre&s;ented to your excellency, that not one word of the geography of the&s;e merchants is true, upon which all their rea&s;oning is founded; it might &s;eem needle&s;s to trouble your excellency with any further re|marks, were it not to &s;how with what earne&s;tne&s;s they are promoting the French intere&s;t, to the prejudice of all his maje&s;ty's colonies in North-America, and that they are not a&s;hamed of a&s;&s;erting any thing for that end, even in the royal pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they &s;ay, "That by the act pa&s;&s;ed in this province, entitled, 'An act for the encouragement of the Indian trade, &amp;c.' all trade what&s;oever is prohibited in the &s;tricte&s;t man|ner, and under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, between the inhabi|tants of New-York government, and the French of Ca|nada."</P>
<P>This is not true; for only carrying goods to the French, which are proper for the Indian trade, is prohibited. The trade, as to other things, is left in the &s;ame &s;tate it was be|fore that act was made, as it will appear to any per&s;on that &s;hall read it: and there are, yearly, large quantities of other goods, openly, carried to Canada, without any hindrance from the government of New-York. Whatever may be &s;aid of the &s;everity and penalties in that act, they are found in|&s;ufficient to deter &s;ome from carrying goods clande&s;tinely to the French; and the legi&s;lature of this province are con|vinced, that no penalties can be too &s;evere, to prevent a trade, which puts the &s;afety of all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of North America in the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>Their next a&s;&s;ertion is, "All the Indian goods have by this act been rai&s;ed 25<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 30<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per cent." This is the only allegation in the whole petition that there is any ground for. Neverthele&s;s, though the common channel of trade cannot be altered without &s;ome detriment to it in the be|ginning; we are a&s;&s;ured from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, that there has been every year, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, more
<PB N="176" REF="024800_0171_0FCD63BB13DB6B78">furs exported from New-York, than in the year immedi|ately before the pa&s;&s;ing of this act. It is not probable that the greate&s;t difference between the exportation, any year before this act, and any year &s;ince, could &s;o much alter the price of beaver, as it is found to be this la&s;t year. Beaver is carried to Britain from other parts be&s;ides New-York, and it is certain that the price of beaver is not &s;o much al|tered here by the quantity in our market, as by the de|mand for it in Britain. But as we cannot be &s;o well inform|ed here, what occa&s;ions beaver to be in greater demand in Britain, we mu&s;t leave that to be enquired after in England. However, we are fully &s;atisfied, that it will be found to be for very different rea&s;ons from what the merchants allege.</P>
<P>The merchants go on and &s;ay, "Whereas, on the other hand, this branch of the New-York trade, by the di&s;cour|agements brought upon it by this act, is almo&s;t wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed by the French, who have already by this act, been encouraged to &s;end proper European goods to Canada, to carry on this trade, &s;o that &s;hould this act be continued, the New-York trade, which is very con&s;iderable, mu&s;t be wholly lo&s;t to us, and centre in the French.&mdash;Though New-York &s;hould not furni&s;h them, the French would find an|other way to be &s;upplied therewith, either from &s;ome other of his maje&s;ty's plantations, or, it might be, directly from Europe.&mdash;Many of the goods, which the Indians want, being as ea&s;y to be had directly from France or Hol|land, as from Great-Britain."</P>
<P>This is ea&s;ily an&s;wered, by informing your excellency, that the principal of the goods proper for the Indian mar|ket, are only of the manufactures of Great-Britain, or of the Briti&s;h plantations, viz. &s;trouds, or &s;troud-waters, and other woolens, and rum.&mdash;The French mu&s;t be obliged to buy all their woolens (the &s;trouds e&s;pecially) in Eng|land, and thence carry them to France, in order to their tran&s;portation to Canada.</P>
<P>The voyage to Quebec, through the bay of St. Law|rence, is well known to be the mo&s;t dangerous of any in the world, and only practicable in the &s;ummer months. The French have no commodities in Canada, by rea&s;on of the cold and barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil, proper for the We&s;t India markets; and therefore have no rum but by ve&s;&s;els from France, that touch at their i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies. New-York has, by rea&s;on of its &s;ituation, both as to the &s;ea and the Indians, every way the advantage of Canada. The New-York ve&s;&s;els make always two voyages in a year from Eng|land, one in &s;ummer, and another in winter, and &s;everal
<PB N="177" REF="024800_0172_0FCD63BC917CEDC0">voyages in a year to the We&s;t-Indies. It is manife&s;t, there|fore, that it is not in the power of the French to import any goods near &s;o cheap, to Canada, as they are imported to New-York.</P>
<P>But to put this out of all controver&s;y, we need only ob&s;erve to your excellency, that &s;trouds (without which no con&s;iderable trade can be carried on with the Indians) are &s;old at Albany for 10<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a piece: they were &s;old at Mon|treal, before this act took place, at 13<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> and now they are &s;old there for 25<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards; which is an evi|dent proof, that the French have not, in the&s;e four years time, (during the continuance of this act) found out any other way to &s;upply them&s;elves with &s;trouds; and likewi&s;e that they cannot trade without them, &s;eeing they buy them at &s;o extravagant a price.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e appears, that none of the neighbouring co|lonies have been able to &s;upply the French with the&s;e goods; and tho&s;e, that know the geography of the coun|try, know it is impracticable to do it at any tolerable rate, becau&s;e they mu&s;t carry their goods ten times further by land than we need to do.</P>
<P>We are likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured, that the merchants of Mon|treal lately told mr. Vaudreuil, their governor, that if the trade from Albany be not by &s;ome mean or other encour|aged, they mu&s;t abandon that &s;ettlement. We have rea&s;on, therefore, to &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e merchants (at lea&s;t &s;ome of them) have been practi&s;ed upon by the French agents in Lon|don: for no doubt, the French will leave no method un|tried to defeat the pre&s;ent de&s;igns of this government, &s;ee|ing they are more afraid of the con&s;equences of this trade between New-York and the Indians, than of all the warlike expeditions that ever were attempted again&s;t Canada.</P>
<P>But to return to the petitioners. "They conceive nothing can tend more to the withdrawing the affections of the five nations of Indians from the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, than the continuance of the &s;aid act, which in its effects re&s;trains them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably e&s;trange them from the Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t; whereas, by a freedom of commerce, and an encouraged intercour&s;e of trade with the French and their Indians, the Engli&s;h intere&s;t might, in time, be greatly im|proved and &s;trengthened."</P>
<P>It &s;eems to us a &s;trange argument to &s;ay, that an act, the whole purport of which is to encourage our own peo|ple to go among the Indians, and to draw the far Indians through our Indian country to Albany (and which has truly
<PB N="178" REF="024800_0173_0FCD63BFB41469A8">produced the&s;e effects) would, on the contrary, re&s;train them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably e&s;trange them from the Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t; and therefore that it would be much wi&s;er in us, to make u&s;e of the French, to promote the Engli&s;h in|tere&s;t; and for which end, we ought to encourage a free intercour&s;e between them and our Indians. The rever&s;e of this is exactly true, in the opinion of our five nations; who, in all their public treaties with this government, have repre&s;ented again&s;t this trade, as the building the French forts with Engli&s;h &s;trouds: that the encouraging a free|dom of commerce with our Indians and the Indians round them, who mu&s;t pa&s;s through their country to Albany, would certainly increa&s;e both the Engli&s;h intere&s;t and theirs, among all the nations to the we&s;tward of them; and that the carrying the Indian market to Montreal in Canada, draws all the far Indians thither.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing we have to take notice of, is what the merchants a&s;&s;erted before the lords of trade, viz. "That there has not been half the quantity of European goods ex|ported &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, that u&s;ed to be."&mdash;'We are well a&s;&s;ured, that this is no better grounded than the above facts they a&s;&s;ert with the &s;ame po&s;itivene&s;s. For it is well known, almo&s;t to every per&s;on in New-York, that there has not been a le&s;s, but rather a greater quantity of European goods imported into this place, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, than was at any time before it, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time. As this appears by the manife&s;ts in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e here, the &s;ame may likewi&s;e be ea&s;ily proved by the cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e books in London.</P>
<P>As all the arguments of the merchants run upon the ill effects this act has had upon the trade and the minds of the Indians, every one of which we have &s;hown to be a&s;&s;erted, without the lea&s;t foundation to &s;upport them; there nothing now remains, but to &s;how the good effects this act has produced, which are &s;o notorious in this province, that we know not one per&s;on that now opens his mouth again&s;t the act.</P>
<P>Before this act pa&s;&s;ed, none of the people of this pro|vince travelled into the Indian countries to trade. We have now above forty young men, who have been &s;everal times as far as the lakes a trading, and thereby become well acquaint|ed, not only with the trade of the Indians, but likewi&s;e with their manners and languages; and tho&s;e have returned with &s;uch large quantities of furs, that greater numbers are re&s;olved to follow their example; &s;o that we have good
<PB N="179" REF="024800_0174_0FCD63BE10A0C278">rea&s;on to hope, that in a little time, the Engli&s;h will draw the whole Indian trade of the inland countries to Albany, and into the country of the five nations. This government has built a public trading hou&s;e upon Cadaracqui lake, at Irondequat in the Senecas land, and another is to be built, next &s;pring, at the mouth of the Onondagas river. All the far Indians pa&s;s by the&s;e places, in their way to Canada; and they are not above half &s;o far from the Engli&s;h &s;ettle|ments, as they are from the French.</P>
<P>So far is it from being true what the merchants &s;ay, "That the French &s;orts interrupt all communication be|tween the Indians and the Engli&s;h;" that if the&s;e places be well &s;upported, as they ea&s;ily can be from our &s;ettlements, in ca&s;e of a rupture with the French, it will be in the pow|er of this province, to intercept the greate&s;t part of the trade between Canada and the Indians round the lakes and the branches of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.&mdash;Since this act pa&s;&s;ed, many nations have come to Albany to trade, and peace and friend|&s;hip, who&s;e names had not &s;o much as been heard of a|mong us.&mdash;In the beginning of May, 1723, a nation of In|dians came to Albany, &s;inging and dancing, with their ca|lumets before them, as they always do when they come to any place, where they have not been before. We do not find that the commi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs, were able to inform them&s;elves what nation this was.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the &s;ame month, eighty men, be|&s;ides the women and children, came to Albany in the &s;ame manner. The&s;e had one of our five nations with them for an interpreter, by whom they informed the commi&s;&s;ioners, that they were of a great nation, called Nehkereages, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix ca&s;tles and tribes; and that they lived near a place called by the French, Mi&s;&s;imakinah, between the up|per lake and the lake of the Hurons. The&s;e Indians not only de&s;ired a free commerce, but likewi&s;e to enter into a &s;trict league of friend&s;hip with us and our &s;ix nations, that they might be accounted the &s;eventh nation in the league: and being received accordingly, they left their calumet as a pledge of their fidelity. In June, another nation ar|rived, but from what part of the continent we have not learned.</P>
<P>In July, the Twightwies arrived, and brought an In|dian interpreter of our nations with them, who told, that they were called by the French Miamies, and that they live upon one of the branches of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, &s;ome of the Tah&s;agrondie Indians, who live be|tween lake Erie and the lake Hurons, near a French &s;ettle|ment,
<PB N="180" REF="024800_0175_0FCD63C48ABA6620">did come and renew their league with the Engli&s;h, nor dur&s;t the French hinder them.&mdash;In July this year, an|other nation came, who&s;e &s;ituation and name we know not; and in Augu&s;t and September, &s;everal parties of the &s;ame Indians, that had been here la&s;t year: but the greate&s;t numbers of the&s;e far Indians have been met this year in the Indian country by our traders, every one of them endea|vouring to get before another, in order to reap the profits of &s;o advantageous a trade, which has all this &s;ummer long, kept about forty traders con&s;tantly employed, in going be|tween our trading-places, in our Indian country, and Al|bany.</P>
<P>All the&s;e nations of Indians, who came to Albany, &s;aid, that the French had told them many &s;trange &s;tories of the Engli&s;h, and did what they could, to hinder their coming to Albany; but that they had re&s;olved to break through by force. The difference on this &s;core between the Tah&s;a|grondie Indians and the French (who have a fort and &s;et|tlement there, called by them le Detroit) ro&s;e to that height, this &s;ummer, that mr. Tonti, who commanded there, thought it proper to retire, and return to Canada with many of his men.</P>
<P>We are, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, well a&s;&s;ured, that this year there will be more beaver exported for Great Britain, than ever was from this province in one year; and that if the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books at London be looked into, it will be found, that there will be a far greater quantity of goods for the Indians (&s;trouds e&s;pecially) &s;ent over next &s;pring, than ever was at any one time to this province. For the mer|chants here tell us, that they have at this time ordered more of the&s;e goods, than ever was done at any one time before.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters of fact prove, beyond contradiction, that this act has been of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to New-York, in making us acquainted with many nations of Indians, for|merly entirely unknown, and &s;trangers, to us; withdraw|ing them from their dependence upon the French, and in uniting them to us and our Indians, by means of trade and mutual offices of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Of what great con&s;equence this may be to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t in general, as to trade, is apparent to any body. It is no le&s;s apparent, likewi&s;e, that it is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the &s;afety of all the Bri|ti&s;h colonies in North America. We feel, too &s;en&s;ibly, the ill effects of the French intere&s;t in the pre&s;ent war betwixt New England, and only one nation of Indians &s;upported by the French. Of what di&s;mal con&s;equences then might it be, if the French &s;hould be able to influence, in the &s;ame
<PB N="181" REF="024800_0176_0FCD63C5903F0AD8">manner, &s;o many and &s;uch numerous nations, as lie to the we&s;tward of this province, Penn&s;ylvania, and Maryland? On the other hand, if all the&s;e nations (who a&s;&s;ert their own freedom, and declare them&s;elves friends to tho&s;e that &s;up|ply them be&s;t with what they want) be brought to have a dependence upon the Engli&s;h (as we have good rea&s;on to hope in a &s;hort time they will) the French of Canada, in ca&s;e of a war, mu&s;t be at the mercy of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>To the&s;e advantages mu&s;t be added, that many of our young men having been induced by this act to travel a|mong the Indians, they learn their manners, their lan|guages, and the &s;ituation of all their countries, and become inured to all manner of fatigues and hard&s;hips: and a great many more being re&s;olved to follow their example, the&s;e young men, in ca&s;e of war with the Indians, will be of ten times the &s;ervice, that the &s;ame number of the common mili|tia can be of.&mdash;The effects of this act have likewi&s;e &s;o much quieted the minds of the people, with re&s;pect to the &s;ecu|rity of the frontiers, that our &s;ettlements are now extend|ed above thirty miles further we&s;t towards the Indian coun|tries, than they were before it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The only thing that now remains to an&s;wer, is an ob|jection which we &s;uppo&s;e may be made, what can induce the merchants of London to petition again&s;t an act, which will be really &s;o much for their intere&s;t in the end? The rea&s;on is, in all probability, becau&s;e they only con&s;ider their pre&s;ent gain; and that they are not at all concerned for the &s;afety of this country, in encouraging the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary undertaking, if they apprehend their profit for two or three years may be le&s;&s;ened by it. This inclination of the mer|chants has been &s;o notorious, that few nations at war with their neighbours, have been able to re&s;train them from &s;up|plying their enemies with ammunition and arms. The count d'E&s;trade, in his letters in 1638, &s;ays, that when the Dutch were be&s;ieging Antwerp, one Beiland, who had load|ed four fly-boats with arms and powder for Antwerp, being taken up by the prince of Orange's order, and examined at Am&s;terdam, &s;aid boldly, that the burghers of Am&s;terdam had a right to trade every where: that he could name a hundred that were factors for the merchants at Antwerp, and that he was one. "That trade cannot be interrupted, and that for his part he was very free to own, that if to get any thing by trade, it were nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s through hell, he would venture to burn his &s;ails." 'When this principle, &s;o common to merchants, is con&s;idered, and that &s;ome in
<PB N="182" REF="024800_0177_0FCD63C752A44B08">this place have got e&s;tates by trading many years to Canada, it is not to be wondered, that they have acted as factors for Canada in this affair, and that they have tran&s;mitted &s;uch accounts to their corre&s;pondents in London, as are con&s;i&s;tent with the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by the merchants of Ca|nada.</P>

<P>Governor Burnet tran&s;mitted this report to the board of trade; and it had the intended effect. About the latter end of the year 1724, and unfortunate di&s;pute commenced in the French church, of which, becau&s;e it had no &s;mall influ|ence on the public affairs of the government, I &s;hall lay be|fore the reader a &s;hort account.</P>
<P>The per&s;ecutions in France, which en&s;ued upon the re|vocation of the edict of Nantz, drove the prote&s;tant &s;ub|jects of Louis XIV. into the territories of other princes. Many of them fled even into this province: the mo&s;t opu|lent &s;ettled in the city of New-York; others went into the country, and planted New Rochelle; and a few &s;eated them&s;elves at the New Paltz in Ul&s;ter county. Tho&s;e, who re&s;ided in New-York, &s;oon erected a church, upon the principles and model of that in Geneva; and by their growth and foreign acce&s;&s;ions, formed a congregation, for numbers and riches, &s;uperior to all but the Dutch. They had two mini&s;ters; Rou, the fir&s;t called, was a man of
<PB N="183" REF="024800_0178_0FCD63C89FB032A8">learning, but proud, plea&s;urable, and pa&s;&s;ionate. Mouli|naars, his colleague, was mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his pacific &s;pirit, dull parts, and unblameable life and conver&s;ation. Rou de&s;pi&s;ed his fellow labourer, and, for a long time, commanded the whole congregation, by the &s;uperiority of his talents for the pulpit. The other, impatient of repeat|ed affronts and open contempt, rai&s;ed a party in his fa|vour, and this year &s;ucceeded in the election of a &s;et of el|ders, di&s;po&s;ed to humble the delinquent. Rou, being &s;u&s;pi|cious of the de&s;ign, refu&s;ed to acknowledge them duly elected. Incen&s;ed at this conduct, they entered an act in their minutes, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from the pa&s;toral charge of the church, and procured a ratification of the act under the hands of the majority of the people. Governor Burnet had, long before this time, admitted Rou into his familiarity, on the &s;core of his learning: and that con&s;ideration encourag|ed a petition to him, from Rou's adherents, complaining a|gain&s;t the elders. The matter was then referred to a com|mittee of the council, who advi&s;ed that the congregation &s;hould be admoni&s;hed, to bring their differences to an ami|cable conclu&s;ion. Some overtures, to that end, were at|tempted; and the elders offered to &s;ubmit the controver|&s;y to the Dutch mini&s;ters. But Rou, who knew that the French church in this country, without a &s;ynod was unor|ganized, and could not re&s;train him, cho&s;e rather to bring his bill in chancery before the governor.</P>
<P>Mr. Alexander was his council; and mr. Smith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e gentlemen came into the colony in the &s;ame &s;hip in 1715. The latter was born at Newport Pagnel, in Buck|ingham&s;hire. They were among the principal agents in the political &s;truggles during the admini&s;tration of col. Co&s;by.</NOTE>, a young lawyer, of the fir&s;t reputation as a &s;peaker, appeared for the elders. He pleaded to the juri&s;diction of the court, in|&s;i&s;ting that the matter was entirely eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and, in the pro&s;ecution of his argument, entered largely into an ex|amination of the government of the prote&s;tant churches in France. According to which, he &s;howed, that the con&s;i&s;tory were the proper judges of the point in di&s;pute, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and that from thence an appeal lay to a collogue, next to a provincial, and la&s;t of all to a national &s;ynod. Mr. Burnet neverthele&s;s over-ruled the plea; and the defen|dants, being fearful of a decree, that might expo&s;e their own e&s;tates to the payment of Rou's &s;alary, thought it ad|vi&s;eable
<PB N="184" REF="024800_0179_0FCD57FB364186C0">to drop their debates, rein&s;tate the mini&s;ter, and leave the church.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed Rou, were di&s;obliged with the governor: among the&s;e mr. de Lancey was the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable for his wealth and popular influence. He was very rigid in his religious profe&s;&s;ion, one of the fir&s;t builders, and by far the mo&s;t generous benefactor, of the French church; and therefore left it with the utmo&s;t reluctance. Mr. Burnet, before this time, had con&s;idered him as his enemy, becau&s;e he had oppo&s;ed the prohibition of the French trade; and this led him into a &s;tep, which, as it was a per&s;onal indignity, mr. de Lancey could never recol|lect without re&s;entment. This gentleman was returned for the city of New-York, in the room of a decea&s;ed member, at the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly in September 1725. When he offered him&s;elf for the oaths, mr. Burnet a&s;ked him how he became a &s;ubject of the crown? He an&s;wered, that he was denizened in England: and his excellency di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, taking time to con&s;ider the matter. Mr. de Lancey then laid before the hou&s;e an act of a notary public, certi|fying that he was named in a patent of denization, grant|ed in the reign of James the &s;econd&mdash;a patent of the &s;ame kind, under the great &s;eal of this province, in 1686&mdash;and two certificates, one of his having taken the oath of alle|giance, according to an act pa&s;&s;ed here in 1683, and another of his &s;erving in &s;everal former a&s;&s;emblies. The governor, in the mean time, con&s;ulted the chief ju&s;tice, and tran&s;|mitted his opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What colonel Morris's opinion was, I have not been able to di&s;cover. Governor Burnet's conduct was thought to be uncon&s;titutional, and an inva&s;ion of the rights of the a&s;&s;embly, who claim the exclu&s;ive privilege of determining the qualifications of their own members.</NOTE> to the hou&s;e, who re&s;olved in favour of mr. de Lancey. Several other new repre&s;entatives came in, at this &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon the decea&s;e of the old members; and Adolph Philip&s;e, who was &s;ometime before di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the council board, was elected into the &s;peaker's chair, in the ab&s;ence of mr. Living&s;ton. The majority, however, continued in the intere&s;t of the governor; and con&s;ented to the revival of the &s;everal acts, which had been pa&s;&s;ed for prohibiting the French trade; which, in &s;pite of all the re&s;traints laid upon it, was clande&s;tinely carried on by the people of Albany. O&s;wego, neverthele&s;s, grew
<PB N="185" REF="024800_0180_0FCD63CE31D57A10">con&s;iderable for its commerce: fifty-&s;even canoes went there this &s;ummer, and returned with &s;even hundred and thirty-eight packs of beaver and deer &s;kins.</P>
<P>Nothing could more naturally excite the jealou&s;y of the French, than the erection of the new trading hou&s;e at the mouth of the Onondaga river. Fearful of lo&s;ing a profitable trade, which they had almo&s;t entirely engro&s;&s;ed, and the command of the lake Ontario, they launched two ve&s;&s;els in it in 1726, and tran&s;ported materials, for building a large &s;tore-hou&s;e, and repairing the fort at Niagara. The &s;cheme was not only to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the entrance into the we&s;t end of the lake, as they already had the ea&s;t, by the fraudulent erection of &s;ort Frontenac, many years before; but al&s;o to carry their trade more we&s;terly, and thus render O&s;wego u&s;ele&s;s, by &s;hortening the travels of the we&s;tern Indians, near two hundred miles. Baron de Lon|guiel, who had the chief command in Canada, on the death of the marquis de Vaudreuil, in October 1725, was &s;o in|tent upon this project, that he went, in per&s;on, to the On|ondaga canton, for leave to rai&s;e the &s;tore-hou&s;e at Nia|gara: and as tho&s;e Indians were mo&s;t of all expo&s;ed to the intrigues of the je&s;uits, who con&s;tantly re&s;ided among&s;t them, he prevailed upon them by fraud and fal&s;e repre|&s;entations, to con&s;ent to it, for their protection again&s;t the Engli&s;h. But as &s;oon as this matter was made known to the other nations, they declared the permi&s;&s;ion granted by the Onondagas to be ab&s;olutely void; and &s;ent deputies to Nia|gara, with a me&s;&s;age, &s;ignifying that the country, in which they were at work, belonged &s;olely to the Senecas; and required them immediately to de&s;i&s;t. The French, notwith|&s;tanding, were regardle&s;s of the emba&s;&s;age, and pu&s;hed on their enterpri&s;e with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, while Joncaire exerted all his addre&s;s among the Indians, to prevent the demolition of the works. Canada was very much indebted to the ince&s;&s;ant intrigues of this man. He had been adopted by the Senecas, and was well e&s;teemed by the Onondagas. He &s;poke the Indian language, as Charlevoix informs us, "avec la plus &s;ublime eloquence Iroquoi&s;e," and had lived among&s;t them, after their manner, from the beginning of queen Anne's reign. All the&s;e advantages he improved for the intere&s;t of his country; he facilitated the mi&s;&s;iona|ries in their progre&s;s through the cantons, and more than any man contributed to render their dependence upon the Engli&s;h, weak and precarious. Convinced of this, colonel Schuyler urged the Indians, at his treaty with them, in
<PB N="186" REF="024800_0181_0FCD63CF5AEB8E48">1719, to drive Joncaire out of their country; but his en|deavours were fruitle&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame thing has &s;ince been frequently laboured, but to no purpo&s;e. His &s;on continued the cour&s;e of intrigues begun by the father, till general Shirley, while he was at O&s;wego in 1755, prevailed upon the Senecas to order him to Canada.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The je&s;uit Charlevoix does honour to mr. Burnet, in de|claring that he left no &s;tone unturned, to defeat the French de&s;igns at Niagara. Nor is it much to be wondered at. For be&s;ides &s;upplanting his favourite trade at O&s;wego, it tended to the defection of the five nations; and in ca&s;e of a rup|ture, expo&s;ed the frontiers of our &s;outhern colonies to the ravages of the French and their allies. Mr. Burnet, upon whom the&s;e con&s;iderations made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, laid the matter before the hou&s;e&mdash;remon&s;trated again&s;t the proceedings to Longuiel in Canada&mdash;wrote to the mini&s;try in England, who complained of them to the French court&mdash;and met the confederates at Albany, endeavouring to convince them of the danger they, them&s;elves, would be in, from an a&s;piring, ambitious neighbour. He &s;poke fir&s;t about the affair, privately to the &s;achems, and afterwards, in the public conference, informed them of all the encroach|ments which the French had made upon their fathers, and the ill u&s;age they had met with, according to la Potherie's account, publi&s;hed with the privilege of the French king, at Paris, in 1722. He then reminded them of the kind treat|ment they had received from the Engli&s;h, who con&s;tantly fed and cloathed them, and never attempted any act of ho&s;tilities to their prejudice. This &s;peech was extremely well drawn, the thoughts being conceived in &s;trong figures, particularly expre&s;&s;ive and agreeable to the Indians. The governor required an explicit declaration of their &s;enti|ments, concerning the French tran&s;actions at Niagara; and their an&s;wer was truly categorical. "We &s;peak now in the name of all the &s;ix nations, and come to you howling. This is the rea&s;on why we howl, that the governor of Canada encroaches on our land, and builds thereon." After which they intreated him to write to the king for &s;uccour. Mr. Burnet embraced this favourable opportunity to procure from them a deed, &s;urrendering their country to his maje&s;|ty, to be protected for their u&s;e, and confirming their grant in 1701, concerning which there was only an entry in
<PB N="187" REF="024800_0182_0FCD63D0D0506828">the books of the &s;ecretary for Indian affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the territories at the we&s;t end of lake Erie, and on the north &s;ide of that, and the lake Ontario, which were ceded in 1701; the Indians now granted, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, all their habitations from O&s;wego to Cayahoga river, which di&s;embogues into lake Erie, and the country extending &s;ixty miles from the &s;outhermo&s;t banks of tho&s;e lakes. Though the fir&s;t &s;urrender, through negligence, was not made by the execution of a formal deed under &s;eal; yet as it was tran&s;acted with all the &s;olemnity of a treaty, and as the &s;econd &s;urrender confirms the fir&s;t, no intermedi|ate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the French, can prejudice the Briti&s;h title derived by the ce&s;&s;ion in 1701.</NOTE>. It happened very unfortunately, that his excellency's hands were then more weakened than ever, by the growing di&s;affection in the hou&s;e. The intrigues of his adver&s;aries, and the fre|quent deaths of the members, had introduced &s;uch a change in the a&s;&s;embly, that it was with difficulty he pro|cured a three years &s;upport. The clamours of the people ran &s;o high without doors for a new election, that he was obliged to di&s;&s;olve the hou&s;e, and &s;oon after another di&s;&s;o|lution en&s;ued on the death of the king. The French, in the mean time, completed their works at Niagara: and mr. Bur|net, who was unable to do any thing el&s;e, erected a fort, in 1727, for the protection of the po&s;t and trade at O&s;wego. This nece&s;&s;ary undertaking was pregnant with the mo&s;t im|portant con&s;equences, not only to this, but all our colonies; and though the governor's &s;ea&s;onable activity de&s;erved the highe&s;t te&s;timonials of our gratitude, I am a&s;hamed to con|fe&s;s, what I am bound to relate, that he built the fort at his private expen&s;e, and that a balance of about 56<ABBR>l.</ABBR> principal, though frequently demanded, remains due to his e&s;tate to this very day.</P>
<P>Beauharnois, the governor of Canada, who &s;uper&s;eded Longuiel, was &s;o incen&s;ed at the building of the fort, that he &s;ent a written &s;ummons in July, to the officer po&s;ted there, to abandon it; and though his predece&s;&s;or had done the &s;ame, a little before, at Niagara, in the country of the Senecas, the acknowledged &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Though the &s;overeignty over the five nations was ceded to Great Britain, and Charlevoix him&s;elf had ac|knowledged that Niagara was part of their country, yet the pious je&s;uit applauds the French &s;ettlement there, which was &s;o manife&s;t an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht. The marquis de Nonville, in his letter to the court of France, in 1686, propo&s;ed the erection of a fort there, to &s;ecure the communication with the lakes, and deprive us of a trade which he computed to be worth 400,000 francs per annum. Charlevoix, perhaps, con&s;idered the&s;e advantages &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the violation of public faith; rea&s;oning upon the principles of le chevalier de Callieres, who thought the legality of making a conque&s;t of New York, during the &s;trict peace in James IId's reign, might be infer|red from the benefit, that would, thereby, accrue to the French colony, <HI>"qu' il n'y avoit point d'autre voye pour con|&s;erver la colonie, que de nous rendre maitres de la Nouvelle York; et que cette conqu&ecirc;te etoit legitime par la nece&s;&s;it&eacute;."</HI></NOTE>,

His excellency &s;ent him a polite, but re|&s;olute an&s;wer, on the eighth of Augu&s;t; in which he re|futed the arguments urged by the French governor gene|ral; and remon&s;trated again&s;t the proceedings of the la&s;t year at Niagara.</P>
<P>The new a&s;&s;embly met in September 1727, and con&s;i&s;ted of members all ill affected to the governor. The long continuance of the la&s;t, the clamours which were excited by &s;everal late important decrees in chancery, the affair of the French church, and e&s;pecially the prohibiting the Cana|da trade, were the cau&s;es, to which the lo&s;s of his intere&s;t is to be a&s;cribed. Mr. Philip&s;e, the &s;peaker, was piqued at a decree in chancery again&s;t him&s;elf, which very much affected his e&s;tate; no wonder, then, that the members, who were very much influenced by him, came, on the 25th of November, into the following re&s;olutions. Colonel Hicks, from the committee of grievances, reported, "That as well by the complaints of &s;everal people, as by the general cry of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects inhabiting this colony, they find that the court of chancery, as lately a&s;&s;umed to be &s;et up here, renders the liberties and properties of the &s;aid &s;ub|jects extremely precarious; and that by the violent mea|&s;ures taken in, and allowed by it, &s;ome have been ruined, others obliged to abandon the colony, and many re&s;trained in it, either by impri&s;onment or by exce&s;&s;ive bail exacted from them not to depart, even when no manner of &s;uits are depending again&s;t them: and therefore are of opinion,
<PB N="189" REF="024800_0184_0FCD63D3CBF821F8">that the extraordinary proceedings of that court; and the exorbitant fees and charges, countenanced to be exacted by the officers and practitioners thereof, are the greate&s;t grievance and oppre&s;&s;ion this colony hath ever felt: and that for removing the fatal con&s;equences thereof, they had come to &s;everal re&s;olutions, which being read, were ap|proved by the hou&s;e, and are as follow:</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that the erecting or exerci&s;ing, in this colo|ny, a court of equity or chancery (however it may be term|ed) without con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is unwarrantable, and contrary to the laws of England, and a manife&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ion and grievance to the &s;ubjects, and of pernicious con&s;equence to their liberties and properties.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that this hou&s;e will at their next meeting prepare and pa&s;s an act to declare and adjudge all orders, ordinances, devices, and proceedings, of the court, &s;o a&s;|&s;umed to be erected and exerci&s;ed as abovementioned, to be illegal, null, and void, as by law and right they ought to be.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that this hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time, will take into con&s;ideration, whether it be nece&s;&s;ary, to e&s;tabli&s;h a court of equity or chancery, in this colony; in whom the juri&s;diction thereof ought to be ve&s;ted; and how far the powers of it &s;hall be pre&s;cribed and limited."</P>
<P>Mr. Burnet no &s;ooner heard of the&s;e votes, than he cal|led the members before him, and di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly. They occa&s;ioned, however, an ordinance in the &s;pring fol|lowing, as well to remedy &s;undry abu&s;es in the practice in chancery, as to reduce the fees of that court, which, on account of the popular clamours, were &s;o much dimini&s;hed, that the wheels of the chancery have ever &s;ince ru&s;ted upon their axes, the practice being contemned by all gentlemen of eminence in the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are now come to the clo&s;e of mr. Burnet's admini|&s;tration, when he was appointed to the chief command of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's bay. Though we never had a governor, to whom the colony is &s;o much indebted as to him; yet the influence of a faction, in the judgment of &s;ome, rendered his removal nece&s;&s;ary for the public tranquillity. In&s;en&s;ible of his merit, the undi&s;tingui&s;hing multitude were taught to con&s;ider it as a mo&s;t fortunate event; and till the ambiti|ous de&s;igns of the French king, with re&s;pect to America, awakened our attention to the general welfare, mr. Bur|net's admini&s;tration was as little e&s;teemed, as that of the meane&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>He was very fond of New-York, and left it with reluc|tance.
<PB N="190" REF="024800_0185_0FCD63D8D61AC870">His marriage here connected him with a numerous family; and, be&s;ides an univer&s;al acquaintance, there were &s;ome gentlemen, with whom he contracted a &s;trict intimacy and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive love of money, a di&s;ea&s;e common to all his predece&s;&s;ors, and to &s;ome who &s;ucceeded him, was a vice, from which he was entirely free. He &s;old no offices, nor at|tempted to rai&s;e a fortune by indirect means; for he lived generou&s;ly, and carried &s;carce any thing away with him, but his books. The&s;e, and the conver&s;ation of men of let|ters, were to him inexhau&s;tible &s;ources of delight. His a&s;tro|nomical ob&s;ervations have been u&s;eful; but by his comment on the apocalyp&s;e, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf, as other learned men have before him, to the critici&s;ms of tho&s;e who have not abilities to write half &s;o well.</P>
<P>John Montgomerie, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> received the great &s;eal of this province from mr. Burnet, on the 15th of April 1728, having a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;uper&s;ede him here and in New-Jer&s;ey. The council board con&s;i&s;ted of

<P>The governor was a Scotch gentleman, and bred a &s;ol|dier; but, in the latter part of his life, he had little con|cern with arms, having &s;erved as groom of the bedcham|ber, to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, before his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. This &s;tation, and a &s;eat he had in parliament, pa|ved the way to his preferment in America. In his talents for government, he was much inferior to his predece&s;&s;or; for he had neither &s;trength nor acutene&s;s of parts, and was but little acquainted with any kind of literature.</P>
<P>As in the natural, &s;o in the political world, a violent &s;torm is often immediately &s;ucceeded by a peaceful calm; tired by the mutual &s;truggles of party rage, every man now cea&s;ed to act under its influence. The governor's good humour, too, extingui&s;hed the flames of contention; for being unable to plan, he had no particular &s;cheme to pur|&s;ue; and thus by confining him&s;elf to the exerci&s;e of the common acts of government, our public affairs flowed on in a peaceful, uninterrupted &s;tream.</P>
<P>The reader will, for this rea&s;on, find none of tho&s;e

Indeed, he devoted him&s;elf &s;o much to his ea&s;e, that he has &s;carce left us any thing to perpetuate the remembrance of his time.</P>
<P>The two rocks upon which the public tranquillity was &s;hipwrecked in the late admini&s;tration, he carefully avoid|ed; for he di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly, called by his predece&s;|&s;or, before they had ever been convened: and as to the chan|cery, he him&s;elf countenanced the clamours again&s;t it, by declining to &s;it, till enjoined to exerci&s;e the office of chan|cellor by &s;pecial orders from England. He then obeyed the command, but not without di&s;covering his reluctance, and mode&s;tly confe&s;&s;ing to the practi&s;ers, that he thought him&s;elf unqualified for the &s;tation. Indeed the court of chancery was evidently his aver&s;ion, and he never gave a &s;ingle decree in it, nor more than three orders; and the&s;e, both as to matter and form, were fir&s;t &s;ettled by the coun|cil concerned.</P>
<P>Mr. Philip&s;e was cho&s;en &s;peaker of the a&s;&s;embly which met on the 23d of July, and continued &s;itting in perfect harmony till autumn. After his excellency had procured a five years &s;upport, and &s;everal other laws to his mind, of le&s;s con&s;iderable moment; he went up to Albany, and, on the 1&s;t of October, held a treaty with the &s;ix nations, for a renewal of the ancient covenant. He gave them great pre&s;ents, and engaged them in the defence of O&s;wego. Nothing could be more &s;ea&s;onable than this interview; for the French, who eyed that important garri&s;on, and our in|crea&s;ing trade there, with the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s jealou&s;y, pre|pared, early in the &s;pring following, to demoli&s;h the works. Governor Burnet gave the fir&s;t intelligence of this de&s;ign, in a letter to colonel Montgomerie, dated at Bo&s;ton the 31&s;t of March 1729. The garri&s;on was thereupon im|mediately reinforced by a detachment from the indepen|dent companies; which, together with the declared re&s;o|lution of the Indians, to protect the fort; induced the French to de&s;i&s;t from the intended inva&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From that time, to the year 1754, this garri&s;on was guarded only by a lieutenant and five and twenty men.

Be&s;ides the ve&s;&s;els launched there, to &s;ecure the command of the lake, the general, be|fore he returned to winter quarters, erected two &s;trong &s;quare forts, with ba&s;tions, commanding as well the en|trance into the Onondaga river, as the old fort; in the &s;i|tuation of which, little regard was had to any thing be&s;ides the plea&s;antne&s;s of the pro&s;pect.</NOTE>.</P>

Thus far our Indian affairs appeared to be under a tole|rable direction; but the&s;e fair pro&s;pects were &s;oon ob&s;cur|ed by the king's repealing, on the 11th of December, 1729, all the acts which mr. Burnet, with &s;o much labour and oppo&s;ition, procured for the prohibition of an execrable trade between Albany and Montreal. To who&s;e intrigues this event is to be a&s;cribed, cannot be certainly determined. But that it was pregnant with the wor&s;t con&s;equences, time has &s;ufficiently evinced. Nothing could more naturally tend to undermine the trade at O&s;wego, to advance the French commerce, at Niagara, to alienate the Indians from their fidelity to Great Britain, and particularly to rivet the defection of the Caghnuagas. For the&s;e, re&s;iding on the &s;outh &s;ide of St. Lawrence, nearly oppo&s;ite Montreal, were employed by the French as their carriers; and thus became intere&s;ted again&s;t us, by motives of the mo&s;t prevailing na|ture. One would imagine, that after all the attention be|&s;towed on this affair in the late admini&s;tration, the objec|tions again&s;t this trading intercour&s;e with Canada, mu&s;t have been obvious to the meane&s;t capacity; and yet, &s;o a&s;|toni&s;hing has been our conduct, that from the time mr. Burnet removed to Bo&s;ton, it has rather been encouraged than re&s;trained. This trade, indeed, was &s;ubject to duties; but that at O&s;wego always was, and &s;till is, expo&s;ed to the &s;ame incumbrance; while the French trade, in the interval between the years 1744 and 1750, was perfectly free: and as the duty, by the law then made, is laid only on goods &s;old in the city and county of Albany, the trader, to elude the act, is only expo&s;ed to the trouble of tran&s;porting his merchandi&s;e, beyond the &s;cant di&s;trict of the city, a&s;cer|tained in the charter. But how much &s;oever our inattention to this matter may de&s;erve cen&s;ure, I cannot, in ju&s;tice to my countrymen, help ob&s;erving, that from the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny I could make, our people are free from the charge of &s;elling ammunition to the French, which has &s;o unju&s;tly

<P>The year 1731 was di&s;tingui&s;hed, only by the complete &s;ettlement of the di&s;puted boundary between this province and the colony of Connecticut. An event, con&s;idering the late colonizing &s;pirit, and exten&s;ive claims of the people of New England, of no &s;mall importance, and concerning which it may be proper to give a &s;uccinct account.</P>
<P>The partition line agreed upon in 1664, being con&s;ider|ed as fraudulent, or erroneous; a &s;econd agreement, &s;u&s;|pended only for the king's and the duke's approbation, was concluded on the 23d of November, 1683, between colonel Dongan and his council, and Robert Trent, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> then go|vernor of Connecticut, and &s;everal other commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed by that colony. The line of partition, then agreed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, was to begin at the mouth of Byram brook, "Where it falleth into the &s;ound, at a point called Lyon's point, to go as the &s;aid river runneth, to the place where the common road, or wading place, over the &s;aid river is; and from the &s;aid road, or wading place, to go north north-we&s;t into the country, as far as will be eight Engli&s;h miles from the fore&s;aid Lyon's Point; and that a line of twelve miles, being mea&s;ured from the &s;aid Lyon's point, ac|cording to the line or general cour&s;e of the &s;ound ea&s;tward: where the &s;aid twelve miles endeth, another line &s;hall be run from the &s;ound, eight miles into the country, north north-we&s;t; and al&s;o, that a fourth line be run (that is to &s;ay) from the northermo&s;t end of the eight miles line, be|ing the third mentioned line, which fourth line, with the fir&s;t mentioned line, &s;hall be the bounds where they &s;hall fall to run; and that from the ea&s;termo&s;t end of the fourth mentioned line (which is to be twelve miles in length) a line parallel to Hud&s;on's river, in every place twenty miles di&s;tant from Hud&s;on's river, &s;hall be the bounds there, between the &s;aid territories or province of New-York, and the &s;aid colony of Connecticut, &s;o far as Connecticut colo|ny doth extend northwards; that is, to the &s;outh line of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony: only it is provided, that in ca&s;e the line from Byram brook's mouth, north north-we&s;t eight miles, and the line, that is then to run twelve miles to the
<PB N="194" REF="024800_0189_0FCD63E1D0B344C0">end of the third fore-mentioned line of eight miles, do di|mini&s;h or take away land, within twenty miles of Hud&s;on's river, that then &s;o much as is in land dimini&s;hed of twenty miles of Hud&s;on's river thereby, &s;hall be added out of Con|necticut bounds unto the line aforementioned, parallel to Hud&s;on's river, and twenty miles di&s;tant from it; the ad|dition to be made the whole length of the &s;aid parallel line, and in &s;uch breadth, as will make up, quantity for quantity, what &s;hall be dimini&s;hed as afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this agreement, &s;ome of the lines were ac|tually run out, and a report made of the &s;urvey, which, on the 24th of February 1684, was confirmed by the governor of each colony, at Milford in Connecticut. Here the matter re&s;ted, till a di&s;pute aro&s;e concerning the right of juri&s;|diction over the towns of Rye and Bedford, which occa|&s;ioned a &s;olicitation at home; and on the 28th of March 1700, king William was plea&s;ed to confirm the agreement in 1683.</P>
<P>Nineteen years afterwards, a probationary act was pa&s;&s;ed, empowering the governor to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners, as well to run the line parallel to Hud&s;on's river, as to re|&s;urvey the other lines, and di&s;tingui&s;h the boundary. The Connecticut agent oppo&s;ed the king's confirmation of this act, <HI>totis viribus;</HI> but it was approved on the 23d of Janu|ary 1723. Two years after, the commi&s;&s;ioners and &s;urveyors of both colonies met at Greenwich, and entered fir&s;t in|to an agreement, relating to the method of performing the work.</P>
<P>The &s;urvey was immediately after executed in part, the report being dated on the 12th of May 1725; but the com|plete &s;ettlement was not made till the 14th of May 1731, when indentures, certifying the execution of the agreement in 1725, were mutually &s;igned by the commi&s;&s;ioners and &s;urveyors of both colonies. Upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this partition, a tract of land, lying on the Connecticut &s;ide, con&s;i&s;ting of above 60,000 acres, from its figure called the Oblong, was ceded to New-York, as an equivalent for lands near the &s;ound, &s;urrendered to Connecticut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Douglas's late plan of the Briti&s;h dominions of New England.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The very day after the &s;urrender, made by that colony, a patent pa&s;&s;ed in London to &s;ir Jo&s;eph Eyles and others, in|tended to convey the whole Oblong. A grant, po&s;terior to the other, was al&s;o regularly made here, to Hauley and
<PB N="195" REF="024800_0190_0FCD63E2D376E518">company, of the greate&s;t part of the &s;ame tract, which the Briti&s;h patentees brought a bill in chancery to repeal. But the defendants filed an an&s;wer, containing &s;o many objec|tions again&s;t the Engli&s;h patent, that the &s;uit remains &s;till unpro&s;ecuted; and the American proprietors have ever &s;ince held the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Mr. Hari&s;on, of the council, &s;o|licited this controver&s;y for &s;ir Jo&s;eph Eyles and his part|ners, which contributed, in a great degree, to the troubles, &s;o remarkable, in a &s;ucceeding admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Governor Montgomerie died on the 1&s;t of July 1731; and being a man of a kind and humane di&s;po&s;ition, his death was not a little lamented. The chief command then devolv|ed upon Rip Van Dam, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> he being the olde&s;t coun&s;ellor, and an eminent merchant, of a fair e&s;tate, though di&s;tin|gui&s;hed more for the integrity of his heart, than his capa|city to hold the reins of government.

<P>This admini&s;tration is unfortunately &s;ignalized by the memorable encroachment at Crown Point. An enemy de&s;|pi&s;ed at fir&s;t for his weakne&s;s, generally grows formidable for his activity and craft. This ob&s;ervation is true, applied to private per&s;ons, religious &s;ects, or public &s;tates. The French, in Canada, have always been jealous of the in|crea&s;ing &s;trength of our colonies; and a motive of fear led them, naturally, to concert a regular &s;y&s;tem of conduct for their defence. Confining us to &s;cant limits along the &s;ea coa&s;t, is the grand object they have long had in view; and &s;eiz|ing the important pa&s;&s;es from Canada to Loui&s;ania, &s;educing our Indian allies, engro&s;&s;ing the trade, and fortifying the routes into their country, were all proper expedients to|wards the execution of their plan. By erecting fort St. Fre|deric, they &s;ecured the ab&s;olute command of lake Cham|plain, through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s, if ever a de&s;cent be made upon Canada, either to conquer the country, or har|ra&s;s its out-&s;ettlements. The garri&s;on was, at fir&s;t, &s;ituated
<PB N="196" REF="024800_0191_0FCD63E44BE8E788">on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake, near the &s;outh end; but was afterwards built upon a commodious point, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Of all their infractions of the treaty of Utrecht, none was more palpable than this. The country belonged to the &s;ix nations: and the very &s;pot, upon which the fort &s;tands, is included within a patent to Dellius the Dutch mini&s;ter of Albany, granted under the great &s;eal of this province in 1696. Be&s;ides, nothing could be more evident than the danger to which it expo&s;ed us. Through this lake the French parties made their ancient bloody incur&s;ions upon Schenectady, the Mohawks' ca&s;tles, and Deerfield; and the erection of this fort was apparently adapted, to facilitate the inroads of the enemy, upon the frontiers of the colo|nies of New-York, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, and New Hamp&s;hire; for it &s;erved not only as an a&s;ylum to fly to, after the per|petration of their inhumanities, but for a magazine of pro|vi&s;ions and ammunition; and though it was much above 120 miles from the very city of Albany, yet by the conveyance through Sorel river and the lake, it may be reinforced from Montreal in three or four days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent fort at Crown Point is &s;aid to be a &s;quare with four ba&s;tions, and a high ca&s;tle within the walls. It has no ditch, but is &s;trengthened by a redoubt, and mounts &s;ix and thirty &s;mall cannon. While the colony forces, con|&s;i&s;ting of about 4000 militia, lay at lake George, employ|ed in erecting fort William Henry, in 1755, the French threw up an advanced work at Ticonderoge, near the north-ea&s;t end of lake George; an important pa&s;s, about 16 miles to the &s;outhward of fort Frederic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government fore&s;aw the dangerous con&s;equences of the French fort at Crown Point, and gover|nor Belcher gave us the fir&s;t information of it, in a letter from Bo&s;ton to mr. Van Dam. He informed him of the vote of the general court, to bear their proportion of the charge of an emba&s;&s;age to Canada, to forbid the works, and pre&s;&s;|ed him to engage the oppo&s;ition of the &s;ix nations. Van Dam laid the letter before his council, on the 4th of Febru|ary 1732; who, with &s;ingular calmne&s;s, advi&s;ed him to write to the commi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs, at Albany, or|dering them to enquire, whether the land belonged to the confederates or the river Indians. That mr. Van Dam ever wrote to the commi&s;&s;ioners, I have not been able to di&s;cover; nor whether any complaint of the encroachment was &s;ent home, according to the &s;econd advice of council, on the 11th
<PB N="197" REF="024800_0192_0FCD63E8A2B56FE0">of February; who, be&s;ides the fir&s;t &s;tep, were now plea&s;ed to recommend his tran&s;mitting governor Belcher's letter and the Bo&s;ton vote to the &s;everal &s;outh-we&s;tern colonies.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s we di&s;covered, on this impudent and dangerous inva&s;ion of his maje&s;ty's rights, is truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing; and the more &s;o, as the crown had, at that time, four in|dependent companies, which had long been po&s;ted here for our protection, at the annual expen&s;e of about 7500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;ter|ling. A very good &s;cheme, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to repair this &s;hameful mi&s;conduct, was afterwards projected, by &s;ettling the lands near lake George, with loyal prote&s;tant highlan|ders from Scotland. Captain Laughlin Campbel, encourag|ed by a proclamation to that purpo&s;e, came over in 1737, and ample promi&s;es were made to him. He went upon the land, viewed and approved it; and was intreated to &s;ettle there, even by the Indians, who were taken with his high|land dre&s;s. Mr. Clarke, the lieutenant governor, promi&s;ed him, in a printed adverti&s;ement, the grant of 30,000 acres of land, free from all but the charges of the &s;urvey and the king's quit-rent. Confiding on the faith of the government, captain Campbel went home to I&s;la, &s;old his e&s;tate, and, &s;hortly after, tran&s;ported, at his own expen&s;e, 83 prote&s;tant families, con&s;i&s;ting of 423 adults, be&s;ides a great number of children. Private faith and public honour loudly de|manded the fair execution of a project, &s;o expen&s;ive to the undertaker and beneficial to the colony. But it unfortu|nately dropped, through the &s;ordid views of &s;ome per&s;ons in power, who aimed at a &s;hare in the intended grant; to which Campbel, who was a man of &s;pirit, would not con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Captain Campbel, afterwards, made an attempt to redre&s;s him&s;elf, by an application to the a&s;&s;embly here, and then to the board of trade in England. The fir&s;t proved abortive, and &s;uch were the difficulties attending the la&s;t, that he left his coloni&s;ts to them&s;elves; and with the poor remains of his broken fortune purcha&s;ed a &s;mall farm in this province. No man was better qualified than he, for the bu&s;ine&s;s he had engaged in. He had a high &s;en&s;e of honour and a good un|der&s;tanding: was active, loyal, and of a military di&s;po&s;i|tion. For upon the news of the late rebellion in Scotland, he went home, fought under the duke, returned to his fa|mily, and &s;oon after died; leaving a widow and &s;everal children, who &s;till feel the con&s;equences of his di&s;appoint|ments.</P>
<P>Mr. Van Dam fini&s;hed his admini&s;tration, on the 1&s;t of
<PB N="198" REF="024800_0193_0FCD63E98CC11360">Augu&s;t 1732; when William Co&s;by, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> arrived, with a commi&s;&s;ion, to govern this and the province of New-Jer|&s;ey. The hi&s;tory of our public tran&s;actions, from this pe|riod, to the pre&s;ent time, is full of important and enter|taining events, which I leave others to relate. A very near relation to the author had &s;o great a concern in the public controver&s;ies with colonel Co&s;by, that the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times will be better received from a more di&s;intere&s;ted pen. To &s;uppre&s;s truth on the one hand, or exaggerate it, on the other, are both inexcu&s;able faults, and perhaps it would be difficult for me to avoid tho&s;e extremes. Be&s;ides, a writer, who expo&s;es the conduct of the living, will inevitably meet with their fury and re&s;entment. The prudent hi&s;torian of his own times will always be a coward, and never give fire, till death protects him from the malice and &s;troke of his enemy.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t, That they apprehend the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay to the manor of Living&s;ton, or the &s;aid tract of land, call|ed We&s;tenhook, cannot be well founded; becau&s;e they find that the Dutch claimed the colony of New Netherland, as extending from cape Cod to cape Cornelius, now called cape Henlopen, we&s;tward of Delaware bay, along the &s;ea coa&s;t, and as far back into the country, as any of the rivers within tho&s;e limits extend; and that they were actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Connecticut river, long before any other European peop|le knew any thing of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a river, and were not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mouth of it, where they had a fort and garri&s;on, but di&s;covered the river above an hun|dred miles up, had their people trading there, and pur|cha&s;ed of the natives almo&s;t all the lands on both &s;ides of the &s;aid river.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That governor Stuyve&s;ant, the Dutch governor of the &s;aid province, by his letter, dated the 2d of Septem|ber 1664, new &s;tile, in an&s;wer to a letter from governor Richard Nicolls, of the 20/30 Augu&s;t preceding, demanding the &s;urrender of all the forts and places of &s;trength po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed by the Dutch under his (governor Stuyve&s;ant's) com|mand, writes as follows:&mdash;"Moreover it's without di&s;pute, and acknowledged by all the world, that our predece&s;&s;ors, by virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion and patent of the &s;aid lords the &s;tates general, have without controul, and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange about 48 or 50 years; and Manhattans about 41 or 42 years; the &s;outh river 40 years, and the fre&s;h river a|bout 36 years." Which la&s;t mentioned river, the committee find to be the &s;ame, that is now called Connecticut river.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That the &s;aid Dutch governor Stuyve&s;ant did, in the year 1664, &s;urrender all the country, which the Dutch did then po&s;&s;e&s;s, to king Charles the &s;econd, and that the &s;tates general made a ce&s;&s;ion thereof, by the treaty of Breda, in the year 1667: that the Dutch re-conquered part of this province in 1673, and &s;urrendered and ab&s;olutely yielded it to king Charles the &s;econd, in 1673-4, by the trea|ty of London; and that in the year 1674, king Charles granted to the duke of York, all the land between Connec|ticut river and Delaware bay; the whole of the&s;e lands being part of the former colony of New Netherland.</P>
<P N="4">4th, That the duke of York, in his &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions to major Edmund Andro&s;s, on the 1&s;t of July 1674, and to governor Dongan on the 30th of September 1682, among other de&s;criptions of the boundaries of this province, men|tions all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecticut river to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay: that their maje&s;ties, king William and queen Mary, by their commi&s;&s;ion, bearing date the fourth day of January, in the fir&s;t year of their ma|je&s;ties' reign, appointed Henry Sloughter to be governor of the province of New-York, and territories depending there|on; the boundaries whereof, to Connecticut river, on the ea&s;t, were notorious, by the grant and other commi&s;&s;ions a|fore&s;aid, and many other grants and commi&s;&s;ions relating to the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">5th, That the committee apprehend Connecticut river continued the ea&s;t bounds of this province, until the 28th of March 1700, when, by king William's confirmation of an agreement between this provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Connecticut, the we&s;tern bounds of that colony were &s;ettled at twenty miles from Hud&s;on's river: and they cannot find any other altera|tion in the ea&s;tern bounds of this province, and have no rea&s;on to believe any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er was made before, or &s;ince, that time.</P>
<P N="6">6th, "That king James the fir&s;t, by letters patent bear|ing date the 3d of November, in the 18th year of his reign, granted unto the council of Plymouth, from forty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude inclu&s;ive, in which there is a recital to this purpo&s;e. "Now for as much as the king has been certainly given to under&s;tand, by divers good &s;ubjects, that have, for the&s;e many years, frequented tho&s;e coa&s;ts and territories, between the degrees of 40^o and 48^o, that there are no other &s;ubjects of any chri&s;tian king or &s;tate, or by any authority from their &s;overeigns, lords, or princes, actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any the &s;aid lands or precincts, whereby any right, claim, intere&s;t, or title, may, or ought, by that means, to accrue or belong to them," &amp;c. And al&s;o a provi&s;o in the&s;e words, "Provided always, that the &s;aid lands, i&s;lands, or any of the premi&s;&s;es, by the &s;aid letters patent intended or meant to be granted, were not then ac|tually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or inhabited by any other chri&s;tian power or &s;tate." Which patent, the committee conceive, could not ve&s;t any thing in the grantees, by rea&s;on of the &s;aid recital and condition upon which it was granted; part of the pre|mi&s;&s;es being then actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch, and mo&s;t of the &s;aid colony of New Netherland being within the bounds thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7th, That the council of Plymouth, by their deed, dated the 19th of March, in the third year of king Charles the fir&s;t, granted to &s;ir Henry Ro&s;&s;well and others, part of what was &s;uppo&s;ed to be granted by the &s;aid letters patent, which grant, from the &s;aid council of Plymouth, the com|mittee take to be void, as founded upon the &s;aid void pa|tent.</P>
<P N="8">8th, That he, the &s;aid &s;ir Henry Ro&s;&s;well, and others, obtained a grant and confirmation thereof, from the crown, under the great &s;eal of England, dated the 4th of March, in the fourth year of king Charles the fir&s;t, within which grant and confirmation, the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay is in|cluded; which grant and confirmation was adjudged void in the high court of chancery of England, in the year 1684. And the committee are of opinion, that nothing, to the we&s;tward of Connecticut river, could pa&s;s by that grant and confir|mation; for that his maje&s;ty could not have had an inten|tion to grant the &s;ame, it being then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Dutch, as before mentioned.</P>
<P N="9">9th, That the committee conceive the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay can claim nothing at pre&s;ent, but what is granted them by their la&s;t charter in 1691; all their other grants and charters being either void of them&s;elves, or de|clared &s;o in the chancery of England.</P>
<P N="10">10th, That the bounds granted, by this charter, are we&s;tward as far as the colonies of Rhode I&s;land, Connecti|cut, and the Narragan&s;et country: which words being in the ca&s;e of a grant from the crown, the committee conceive, cannot extend their bounds farther than to Connecti|cut colony, and therefore not to Connecticut river, and much le&s;s to the we&s;tward of it; becau&s;e Connecticut it|&s;elf, at the time of that charter, did not, in the knowledge of the crown, extend we&s;tward of that river; nor did till nine years after, when, by the royal approbation, the agree|ment between this province and that colony taking place, (which was not to be in force till &s;uch approbation) the bounds of that colony were &s;ettled as is before mentioned: and the committee conceive it to be again&s;t rea&s;on, to &s;up|po&s;e that the crown intended, by the &s;aid charter, to grant any part of the province of New-York, under the then immediate government of the crown, without expre&s;s men|tion thereof in the charter; and without notification there|of to Henry Sloughter, then governor of this province, that the crown had granted &s;uch a part of what was before with|in his juri&s;diction, by their maje&s;ties' commi&s;&s;ion afore&s;aid to him.</P>
<P N="11">11th, That both the patents, under which the peti|tioners claim, the committee find were granted under the great &s;eal of this province; that of the manor of Living&s;ton in 1686, and that of We&s;tenhook in 1735. And that the lands contained in the &s;aid grants are, the committee ap|prehend, within the juri&s;diction of this province, they being both we&s;t of Connecticut river.</P>
<P N="12">12th, That the committee are of opinion, the attempts of the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, to make en|croachments upon any lands, granted by letters patent un|der the great &s;eal of New-York, or upon any lands within the juri&s;diction of this province, are di&s;re&s;pectful to his maje&s;ty's authority, tend to the di&s;turbance of the &s;ubjects of this province, and may be the cau&s;e of great mi&s;chiefs and di&s;orders.</P>
<P N="13">13th, That the &s;teps taken by the &s;aid inhabitants, even were the bounds of this province doubtful and un&s;ettled, are intru&s;ions, and di&s;re&s;pectful to his maje&s;ty's authority.</P>
<P>"And la&s;tly, The committee are of opinion, that a co|py of &s;o much of this report, as &s;hall be approved of by your excellency and the council, be tran&s;mitted to the lieuten|ant governor of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, reque&s;t|ing that he would take effectual mea&s;ures, that all encroach|ments and di&s;turbances, by the people of that colony, on his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of this province, be &s;tayed; and that he would lay this matter before the next general court, that they may inform your excellency, by what warrant they claim or exerci&s;e any right to &s;oil or juri&s;diction, we&s;tward of Connecticut river; that the &s;ame may be con&s;idered, and &s;uch &s;teps taken towards removing all cau&s;es of en|croachments, or di&s;turbances, for the future, as may be a|greeable to equity and ju&s;tice: to the end, that good un|der&s;tanding may be pre&s;erved, which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween fellow &s;ubjects and neighbouring provinces.</P>

<HEAD>THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of New-York, at fir&s;t, included only the i&s;land, called by the Indians, Manhattans. Manning's i&s;land, the two Barn i&s;lands, and the three Oy&s;ter i&s;lands were in the county. But the limits of the city have &s;ince been aug|mented by charter. The i&s;land is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about 14 miles in length. The &s;outh-we&s;t point projects into a fine &s;pacious bay, nine miles long, and about four in breadth, at the confluence of the waters of Hud&s;on's river, and the &s;treight between Long I&s;land and the northern &s;hore. The Narrows, at the &s;outh end of the bay, is &s;carce two miles wide, and opens the ocean to full view. The pa&s;&s;age up to New-York from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dy Hook, a point that extends farthe&s;t into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is &s;afe, and not above five and twenty miles in length. The common navi|gation is between the ea&s;t and we&s;t banks, in two or three and twenty feet water. But it is &s;aid, that an eighty gun &s;hip may be brought up, through a narrow, winding, un|frequented channel, between the north end of the ea&s;t bank and Coney I&s;land.</P>
<P>The city has, in reality, no natural ba&s;on or harbour. The &s;hips lie off in the road, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, which is docked out, and better built than the we&s;t &s;ide, becau&s;e the fre&s;hets in Hud&s;on's river, fill it in &s;ome winters with ice.</P>
<P>The city of New-York, as I have el&s;ewhere had occa&s;ion to mention, "con&s;i&s;ts of about two thou&s;and five hundred buildings. It is a mile in length, and not above half that in breadth. Such is its figure in its centre of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;ituation of the hou&s;es, that the mean cartage from one part to another, does not exceed above one quarter of a mile, than which nothing can be more advantageous to a trading city."</P>
<P>It is thought to be as healthy a &s;pot as any in the world. The ea&s;t and &s;outh parts, in general, are low, but the re&s;t is &s;ituated on a dry, elevated &s;oil. The &s;treets are irregu|lar; but, being paved with round pebbles, are clean, and lined with well-built brick hou&s;es, many of which are co|vered with tiled roofs.</P>
<P>No part of America is &s;upplied with markets abound|ing with greater plenty and variety. We have beef, pork, mutton, poultry, butter, wild fowl, veni&s;on, fi&s;h, roots, and herbs, of all kinds, in their &s;ea&s;ons. Our oy&s;ters are a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="206" REF="024800_0201_0FCD63F1D0666CE0">article in the &s;upport of the poor. Their beds are within view of the town; a fleet of two hundred &s;mall craft, are often &s;een there, at a time, when the weather is mild in winter; and this &s;ingle article is computed to be worth annually 10 or 12,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>This city is the metropolis and grand mart of the pro|vince, and, by its commodious &s;ituation, commands al&s;o all the trade of the we&s;tern part of Connecticut and that of Ea&s;t Jer&s;ey. "No &s;ea&s;on prevents our &s;hips from launching out into the ocean. During the great &s;everity of winter, an equal, unre&s;trained activity runs through all ranks, orders, and employments."</P>
<P>Upon the &s;outh-we&s;t point of the city &s;tands the fort, which is a &s;quare with four ba&s;tions. Within the walls is the hou&s;e in which our governors u&s;ually re&s;ide; and oppo|&s;ite to it, brick barracks, built formerly for the independent companies. The governor's hou&s;e is in height three &s;tories, and fronts to the we&s;t; having, from the &s;econd &s;tory, a fine pro&s;pect of the bay and the Jer&s;ey &s;hore. At the &s;outh end there was formerly a chapel, but this was burnt down in the negro con&s;piracy of the &s;pring 1741. According to governor Burnet's ob&s;ervations, this fort &s;tands in the lati|tude 40^o 42&prime; N.</P>
<P>Below the walls of the garri&s;on, near the water, we have lately rai&s;ed a line of fortifications, which com|mands the entrance into the ea&s;tern road and the mouth of Hud&s;on's river. This battery is built of &s;tone, and the mer|lons con&s;i&s;t of cedar joi&s;ts, filled in with earth. It mounts 92 cannon, and the&s;e are all the works we have to defend us. About &s;ix furlongs, &s;outh-ea&s;t of the fort, lies Notten I&s;land, containing about 100 or 120 acres, re&s;erved by an act of a&s;|&s;embly, as a &s;ort of deme&s;ne for the governors, upon which it is propo&s;ed to erect a &s;trong ca&s;tle, becau&s;e an enemy might from thence ea&s;ily bombard the city, without being annoyed either by our battery or the fort. During the late war, a line of pali&s;adoes was run from Hud&s;on's to the Ea&s;t river, at the other end of the city, with block-hou&s;es at &s;mall di&s;tances. The greater part of the&s;e &s;till remain as a monu|ment of our folly, which co&s;t the province about 8000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>The inhabitants of New-York are a mixed people, but mo&s;tly de&s;cended from the original Dutch planters. There are &s;till two churches, in which religious wor&s;hip is per|formed in that language. The old building is of &s;tone and ill built, ornamented with a &s;mall organ loft and bra&s;s branches. The new church is a high, heavy edifice, has a very exten&s;ive area, and was completed in 1729. It has no
<PB N="207" REF="024800_0202_0FCD63F4844E2088">galleries, and yet will perhaps contain a thou&s;and or twelve hundred auditors. The &s;teeple of this church affords a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect, both of the city beneath and the &s;urrounding country. The Dutch congregation is more nu|merous than any other; but as the language becomes di&s;|u&s;ed, it is much dimini&s;hed; and unle&s;s they change their wor&s;hip into the Engli&s;h tongue, mu&s;t &s;oon &s;uffer a total di&s;&s;ipation. They have at pre&s;ent two mini&s;ters: the reve|rend me&s;&s;ieurs Ritzma and de Ronde, who are both &s;trict Calvini&s;ts. Their church was incorporated on the 11th of May, 1696, by the name of "the mini&s;ter, elders, and dea|cons, of the reformed prote&s;tant Dutch church of the city of New-York:" and its e&s;tate, after the expiration of &s;un|dry long lea&s;es, will be worth a very great income<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their charter was confirmed by a late act of a&s;&s;embly, ratified by his maje&s;ty, which recites the VIIIth article of the &s;urrender in 1664.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the Low Dutch congregations, in this and the pro|vince of New-Jer&s;ey, wor&s;hip after the manner of the re|formed church in the united provinces. With re&s;pect to government, they are in principle pre&s;byterians; but yet hold them&s;elves in &s;ubordination to the claffis of Am|&s;terdam, who &s;ometimes permit, and at other times refu&s;e them the powers of ordination. Some of their mini&s;ters con|&s;ider &s;uch a &s;ubjection as anti-con&s;titutional, and hence in &s;e|veral of their late annual conventions, at New-York, called the coetus, &s;ome debates have ari&s;en among them; the ma|jority being inclined to erect a claffis, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical judi|catory, here, for the government of their churches. Tho&s;e of their mini&s;ters, who are natives of Europe, are, in ge|neral, aver&s;e to the project. The expen&s;e attending the or|dination of their candidates, in Holland, and the reference of their di&s;putes to the claffis of Am&s;terdam, is very con&s;i|derable; and with what con&s;equences, the interruption of their corre&s;pondence with the European Dutch, would be attended, in ca&s;e of a war, well de&s;erves their con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides the Dutch, two epi&s;copal churches in this city, upon the plan of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in South Britain. Trinity church was built in 1696, and afterwards enlarged in 1737. It &s;tands very plea&s;antly upon the banks of Hud&s;on's river, and has a large cemetery, on each &s;ide, enclo&s;ed in the front, by a painted, paled fence. Before it a long walk is railed off from the broad-way, the plea&s;ante&s;t
<PB N="208" REF="024800_0203_0FCD63F717433340">&s;treet of any in the whole town. This building is about 148 feet long, including the tower and chancel, and 72 feet in breadth. The &s;teeple is 175 feet in height, and over the door, facing the river, is the following in&s;cription.</P>

<P>The church is, within, ornamented beyond any other place of public wor&s;hip among us. The head of the chan|cel is adorned with an altar-piece, and oppo&s;ite to it, at the other end of the building, is the organ. The tops of the pillars which &s;upport the galleries, are decked with the gilt bu&s;ts of angels winged. From the ceiling are &s;u&s;pended two gla&s;s branches, and on the walls hang the arms of &s;ome of its principal benefactors. The ailes are paved with flat &s;tones.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent rector of this church is the rev. mr. Henry Barclay, formerly a mi&s;&s;ionary among the Mohawks, who receives 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, levied upon all the other clergy and laity in the city, by virtue of an act of a&s;&s;embly, pro|cured by governor Fletcher. He is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by dr. John&s;on and mr. Auchmuty.</P>
<P>This congregation, partly by the arrival of &s;trangers from Europe, but principally by pro&s;elytes from the Dutch churches, is become &s;o numerous, that though the old buil|ding will contain 2000 hearers, yet a new one was erected in 1752. This, called St. George's chapel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The length, exclu&s;ive of the chancel, 92 feet, and its breadth 20 feet le&s;s.</NOTE>, is a very great edifice, faced with hewn &s;tone and tiled.

<P>The rector, churchwardens, and ve&s;trymen of Trinity church, are incorporated by an act of a&s;&s;embly, which grants the two la&s;t the advow&s;on or right of pre&s;entation; but enacts, that the rector &s;hall be in&s;tituted and inducted in a manner mo&s;t agreeable to the king's in&s;tructions to the governor, and the canonical right of the bi&s;hop of London. Their wor&s;hip is conducted after the mode of the church of England; and with re&s;pect to government, they are em|powered to make rules and orders for them&s;elves, being, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, an independent, eccle&s;ia&s;tical cor|poration.</P>
<P>The revenue of this church is re&s;tricted, by an act of a&s;|&s;embly, to 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum: but it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a real e&s;tate, at the north end of the town, which, having been lately divided into lots, and let to farm, will, in a few years, produce a much greater income.</P>
<P>The pre&s;byterians increa&s;ing after lord Cornbury's re|turn to England, called mr. Ander&s;on, a Scotch mini&s;ter, to the pa&s;toral charge of their congregation: and dr. John Ni|col, Patrick Mac Night, Gilbert Living&s;ton, and Thomas Smith, purcha&s;ed a piece of ground, and founded a church in 1719. Two years afterwards, they petitioned colonel Schuyler, who had then the chief command, for a charter of incorporation, to &s;ecure their e&s;tate for religious wor|&s;hip, upon the plan of the church in North-Britain; but were di&s;appointed in their expectations, through the op|po&s;ition of the epi&s;copal party. They, &s;hortly after, renew|ed their reque&s;t to governor Burnet, who referred the pe|tition to his council. The epi&s;copalians again violently op|po&s;ed the grant; and the governor, in 1724, wrote upon the &s;ubject to the lords of trade for their direction. Coun|&s;ellor We&s;t, who was then con&s;ulted, gave his opinion, in the&s;e words: "Upon con&s;ideration of the &s;everal acts of uniformity, that have pa&s;&s;ed in Great Britain, I am of opi|nion that they do not extend to New-York, and con&s;equent|ly an act of toleration is of no u&s;e in that province; and, therefore, as there is no provincial act for uniformity, ac|cording to the church of England, I am of opinion, that by law &s;uch patent of incorporation may be granted, as by the petition is de&s;ired.

<P>The pre&s;ent mini&s;ter, mr. Carle, is a native of France, and &s;ucceeded mr. Rou in 1754. He bears an irreproach|able character, is very intent upon his &s;tudies, preaches mo|derate Calvini&s;m, and &s;peaks with propriety, both of pro|nunciation and ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>The German Lutheran churches are two. Both their pla|ces of wor&s;hip are &s;mall: one of them has a cupola and bell.</P>

<P>The library con&s;i&s;ts of a thou&s;and volumes, which were bequeathed to "the &s;ociety for the propagation of the go&s;|pel in foreign parts," by dr. Millington, rector of Newing|ton. Mr. Humphreys, the &s;ociety's &s;ecretary, in a letter of the 23d of September 1728, informed governor Montgo|merie, that the &s;ociety intended to place the&s;e books in New-York, intending to e&s;tabli&s;h a library, for the u&s;e of the clergy and gentlemen of this and the neighbouring governments of Connecticut, New Jer&s;ey, and Penn&s;ylva|nia, upon giving &s;ecurity to return them; and de&s;ired the governor to recommend it to the a&s;&s;embly, to provide a place to depo&s;it the books, and to concur in an act for the pre&s;ervation of them and others that might be added. Go|vernor Montgomerie &s;ent the letter to the a&s;&s;embly, who ordered it to be laid before the city corporation: and the latter, in June 1729, agreed to provide a proper repo&s;itory for the books, which were accordingly &s;oon after &s;ent over. The greate&s;t part of them are upon theological &s;ubjects; and through the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the keepers, many are mi&s;|&s;ing.</P>
<P>In 1754, a &s;et of gentlemen undertook to carry about a &s;ub&s;cription towards rai&s;ing a public library, and in a few days collected near 600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which were laid out in purcha&s;ing about 700 volumes of new, well-cho&s;en books. Every &s;ub|&s;criber, upon payment of 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> principal, and the annual &s;um of 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> is entitled to the u&s;e of the&s;e books. His right by the articles is a&s;&s;ignable, and, for non-compliance with them, may be forfeited. The care of this library, is com|mitted to twelve tru&s;tees, annually elected by the &s;ub&s;cribers, on the la&s;t Tue&s;day of April, who are re&s;tricted from making any rules repugnant to the fundamental &s;ub&s;cription. This is the beginning of a library, which, in proce&s;s of time, will probably become va&s;tly rich and voluminous; and it would be very proper for the company to have a charter for its &s;ecurity and encouragement. The books are depo&s;ited in the &s;ame room with tho&s;e given by the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the city hall, there belong to the corporation, a large alms-hou&s;e or place of correction, and the exchange, in the latter of which there is a large room rai&s;ed upon

<P>Though the city was put under the government of a mayor, &amp;c. in 1665, it was not regularly incorporated till 1686. Since that time &s;everal charters have been pa&s;&s;ed: the la&s;t was granted by governor Montgomerie, on the 15th of January, 1730.</P>
<P>It is divided into &s;even wards, and is under the govern|ment of a mayor, recorder, &s;even aldermen, and as many a&s;&s;i&s;tants, or common councilmen. The mayor, a &s;heriff, and coroner, are annually appointed by the governor. The recorder has a patent during plea&s;ure. The aldermen, a&s;&s;i&s;|tants, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and collectors, are annually elected by the freemen and freeholders of the re&s;pective wards. The mayor has the &s;ole appointment of a deputy, and, to|gether with four aldermen, may appoint a chamberlain. The mayor, or recorder, four aldermen, and as many a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, form "the common council of the city of New-York:" and this body, by a majority of voices, hath power to make bye-laws for the government of the city, which are binding only for a year, unle&s;s confirmed by the governor and coun|cil. They have many other privileges relating to ferriages, markets, fairs, the a&s;&s;ize of bread, wine, &amp;c. and the li|cen&s;ing and regulation of tavern keepers, cartage, and the like. The mayor, his deputy, the recorder and aldermen, are con&s;tituted ju&s;tices of the peace; and may hold not only a court of record once a week, to take cognizance of all civil cau&s;es, but al&s;o a court of general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace. They have a common clerk, commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor, who enjoys an appointment worth about four or five hundred pounds per annum. The annual revenue of the corporation is near two thou&s;and pounds.

<P>THIS county extends from the &s;outh bounds of the ma|nor of Living&s;ton, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and Ul&s;ter, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river: on the north its limits are not yet a&s;certained. It contains a va&s;t quantity of fine low land. its principal commodities are wheat, pea&s;e, and pine boards.</P>
<P>The city of Albany, which is near 150 miles from New-York, is &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river. There our governors u&s;ually treat with the Indians dependent upon the Briti&s;h crown. The hou&s;es are built of brick, in the Dutch ta&s;te, and are in number about 350. There are two churches in it. That of the epi&s;copalians, the only one in this large county, is a &s;tone building. The congregation is but &s;mall, almo&s;t all the inhabitants re&s;orting to the Duch church, which is a plain, &s;quare, &s;tone edifice. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have no other public buildings, except the city hall and the fort; the latter of which is a &s;tone &s;quare, with four ba&s;tions, &s;ituated on an eminence which overlooks the town, but is it&s;elf commanded by higher ground. The greate&s;t part of the city is fortified only by pali&s;adoes, and in &s;ome places there are &s;mall cannon planted in block-hou&s;es. Albany was incorporated by colonel Dongan, in 1686, and is under the government of a mayor, recorder, &s;ix alder|men, and as many a&s;&s;i&s;tants. It has al&s;o a &s;heriff, town clerk, chamberlain, clerk of the markets, one high con&s;table, three &s;ub-con&s;tables, and a mar&s;hal. The corporation is empower|ed be&s;ides to hold a mayor's court for the trial of civil cau|&s;es, and a court of general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Sixteen or eighteen miles north-we&s;t from Albany, lies Schenectady, on the banks of the Mohawks' river, which falls into Hud&s;on's river 12 miles to the North of Albany. This village is compact and regular, built principally of brick, on a rich flat of low land, &s;urrounded with hills. It has a large Dutch church, with a &s;teeple and town clock, near the centre. The windings of the river through the town, and the fields (which are often overflowed in the &s;pring) form, about harve&s;t, a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect. The lands, in the vale of Schenectady, are &s;o fertile, that they are commonly &s;old at 45<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per acre. Though the farmers u&s;e no kind of manure, they till the fields every year, and
<PB N="217" REF="024800_0212_0FCD640B54DA0728">they always produce full crops of wheat or pea&s;e. Their church was incorporated by governor Co&s;by; and the town has the privilege of &s;ending a member to the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>From this village, our Indian traders &s;et out in battoes for O&s;wego. The Mohawks' river, from hence to fort Hun|ter, abounds with rifts and &s;hoals, which, in the &s;pring, give but little ob&s;truction to the navigation. From thence to its head, or rather to the portage into the Wood Creek, the conveyance is ea&s;y, and the current le&s;s rapid. The banks of this river are, in general, low, and the &s;oil exceed|ing good. Our &s;ettlements, on the north &s;ide, extend to Burnet's field, a flat inhabited by Germans, which produces wheat and pea&s;e in &s;urpri&s;ing plenty. On the &s;outh &s;ide, ex|cept a few Scotch Iri&s;h, in Cherry Valley, at the head of Su&s;quehanna, we have but few farms we&s;t of the three Ger|man towns on Schohare, a &s;mall creek which empties it&s;elf into the Mohawks' river, about 20 miles we&s;t of Schenecta|dy. The fur trade, at O&s;wego, is one of the principal ad|vantages of this county. The Indians re&s;ort thither in May; and the trade continues till the latter end of July. A good road might be made from Schenectady to O&s;wego. In the &s;ummer 1755, fat cattle were ea&s;ily driven there for the ar|my under the command of general Shirley.</P>
<P>The principal &s;ettlements to the northward of Albany, are Conne&s;tigiune, ea&s;tward of Schenectady, on the Mo|hawks' river, which, a little lower, tumbles down a preci|pice of about &s;eventy feet high, called the Cahoes. The &s;urpri&s;e, which, as one might imagine, would naturally be excited by the view of &s;o great a cataract, is much dimi|ni&s;hed by the height of the banks of the river; be&s;ides, the fall is as uniform as a mill dam, being uninterrupted by the projection of rocks.</P>
<P>At Scaghtahook, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the north branch of Hud&s;on's river, there are a few farms, but many more &s;everal miles to the ea&s;tward, and about twenty-five miles from Albany, in the patent of Ho&s;ick. The&s;e were all broke up by an irruption of French and Indians, who, on the 28th of Augu&s;t 1754, killed and &s;calped two per&s;ons, and &s;et fire to the hou&s;es and barns.</P>
<P>About forty miles to the northward of Albany, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, lies Saratoga, a fine tract of low land, from which &s;everal families were driven by the French Indians, in the late war. A project of purcha&s;ing the&s;e lands from the proprietors, &s;ettling them with Indians, rai&s;ing a fort there, and cultivating the &s;oil for them, has been often talked of &s;ince captain Campbell's di&s;ap|pointment,

<P>In the &s;outhern part of the county of Albany, on both &s;ides of Hud&s;on's river, the &s;ettlements are very &s;cattered, except within twelve miles of the city, when the banks be|come low and acce&s;&s;ible. The i&s;lands here, which are many, contain perhaps the fine&s;t &s;oil in the world.</P>
<P>There are two manors in the county, Ron&s;laerwick and Living&s;ton, which have each the privilege of &s;ending a member to the a&s;&s;embly. The tenants of the&s;e manors, and of the patents of Claverack, have free farms, at the an|nual rent of a tenth of the produce, which has as yet been neither exacted nor paid. At Ancram, in the manor of Living&s;ton, is an iron furnace, about fourteen miles from the river. Its be&s;t and mo&s;t improved lands lie at Tachanio in the ea&s;tern parts, which have of late been much di&s;|turbed by the inroads of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts boy, on this and the patents of We&s;ternhook and Claverack.</P>
<P>The winters in this county are commonly &s;evere: and Hud&s;on's river freezes &s;o hard, a hundred miles to the &s;outhward of Albany, as to bear &s;leds loaded with great burdens. Much &s;now is very &s;erviceable to the farmers here, not only in protecting their grain from the fro&s;t, but in facilitating the tran&s;portation of their boards and other produce, to the banks of the river again&s;t the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>

<P>COUNTY is divided by a range of mountains, &s;tretch|ing we&s;tward from Hud&s;on's river, called the high|lands. On the north &s;ide, the lands are very broken, but fertile, and inhabited by Scotch, Iri&s;h, and Engli&s;h pre&s;by|terians. The &s;ociety's mi&s;&s;ionary in Ul&s;ter preaches here &s;ometimes to a &s;mall congregation of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua|&s;ion, which is the only one in the county. Their villages are Go&s;hen, Bethlehem, and Little Britain, all remarkable for producing, in general, the be&s;t butter made in the co|lony. The people on the &s;outh &s;ide of the mountains are all Dutch: and Orange town, more commonly called by the Indian name Tappan; is a &s;mall but very plea&s;ant inland vil|lage, with a &s;tone court-hou&s;e and church. The militia con|&s;i&s;ts of about thirteen hundred fighting men.</P>
<P>This county joins to the province of New-Jer&s;ey on the &s;outh; and the non-&s;ettlement of the partition-line has been the greate&s;t ob&s;truction to its growth.</P>
<P>There is a very valuable tract, called the Drowned Lands, on the north &s;ide of the mountains, containing about 40 or 50,000 acres. The waters, which de&s;cend from the &s;urrounding hills, being but &s;lowly di&s;charged by the river i&s;&s;uing out of it, cover the&s;e va&s;t meadows every win|ter; and hence they become extremely fertile. The fires kindled up in the woods by the deer hunters in autumn, are communicated by the leaves to the&s;e meadows, before the waters ri&s;e above the channel of the river, and a dread|ful
<PB N="220" REF="024800_0215_0FCD6412D910EA78">devouring conflagration over-runs it, con&s;uming the herbage for &s;everal days.

<P>Before I proceed to the de&s;cription of the &s;outhern coun|ties, I beg leave to &s;ay a few words concerning Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P>Its &s;ource has not, as yet, been di&s;covered. We know, in general, that it is in the mountainous, uninhabited coun|try, between the lakes Ontario and Champlain. In its cour&s;e &s;outhward, it approaches the Mohawk's river with|in a few miles at Saucondauga. From thence it runs north and north-ea&s;terly towards lake St. Sacrament, now called lake George, and is not above 8 or 10 miles di&s;tant from it. The cour&s;e then to New-York is very uniform, being in the main &s;outh 12 or 15&deg; we&s;t.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Albany to lake George is computed at 65 miles.

There are three routes from Crown Point to Hud&s;on's river, in the way to Albany; one through lake George, another through a branch of lake Champlain, bearing a &s;outhern cour&s;e, and terminating in a ba&s;on, &s;everal miles ea&s;t of lake George, called the South bay. The third is by a&s;cending the Wood Creek, a &s;hallow &s;tream about one hundred feet broad, which, coming from
<PB N="221" REF="024800_0216_0FCD64152DA5BEC8">the &s;outh-ea&s;t, empties it&s;elf into the &s;outh branch of the lake Champlain.</P>
<P>The place, where the&s;e routes meet, on the banks of Hud|&s;on's river, is called the carrying place. Here fort Lyman, &s;ince called fort Edward, is built: but &s;ort William Henry, a much &s;tronger garri&s;on, was erected at the &s;outh end of lake George, after the repul&s;e of the French forces under the command of baron Die&s;kau, on the 8th of September, 1755. General Shirley thought it more advi&s;able, to &s;trengthen fort Edward, in the concurrence of three routes, than to erect the other at lake George, 17 miles to the northward of it, and wrote a very pre&s;&s;ing letter upon that head to &s;ir William John&s;on who then commanded the provincial troops.</P>
<P>The banks of Hud&s;on's river are, for the mo&s;t part, rocky cliffs, e&s;pecially on the we&s;tern &s;hore. The pa&s;&s;age through the highlands, affords a wild, romantic &s;cene, for &s;ixteen miles, through &s;teep and lofty mountains. The tide flows a few miles above Albany. The navigation is &s;afe, and per|formed in &s;loops of about 40 or 50 tons burden, extremely well accommodated to the river. About &s;ixty miles above the city of New-York, the water is fre&s;h, and, in wet &s;ea|&s;ons, much lower. The river is &s;tored with variety of fi&s;h, which renders a &s;ummer's pa&s;&s;age to Albany, exceedingly diverting to &s;uch as are fond of angling.</P>
<P>The advantages of this river for penetrating into Cana|da, and protecting the &s;outhern colonies from the irrup|tions of the French, by &s;ecuring the command of the lakes, and cutting off the communication between the French &s;et|tlements on St. Lawrence and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, though but lately attended to, mu&s;t be very apparent to every judicious ob&s;erver of the maps of the inland part of North America.</P>
<P>The French, as appears from the intended inva&s;ion, in 1689, have long eyed the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this pro|vince with jealou&s;y; and it becomes us to fall upon every method for its protection and defence.</P>
<P>The &s;ingular conveniency of Hud&s;on's river to this pro|vince in particular, was &s;o fully &s;hown in one of the late papers, publi&s;hed in 1753, under the title of the Inde|pendent Reflector, that I cannot help reprinting the pa&s;&s;age relating to it.</P>
<P>"High roads, which, in mo&s;t trading countries, are ex|tremely expen&s;ive, and awake a continual attention for their reparation, demand from us, comparatively &s;peaking, &s;carce any public notice at all. The whole province is con|tained in two narrow oblongs, extending from the city ea&s;t
<PB N="222" REF="024800_0217_0FCD64168DA4C470">and north, having water carriage from the extremity of one, and from the di&s;tance of one hundred and &s;ixty miles of the other; and by the mo&s;t accurate calculation, has not, at a medium, above twelve miles of land carriage, through|out its whole extent. This is one of the &s;tronge&s;t motives to the &s;ettlement of a new country, as it affords the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;peedy conveyance from the remote&s;t di&s;tances, and at the lowe&s;t expen&s;e. The effects of this advantage are greater than we u&s;ually ob&s;erve, and are therefore not &s;ufficiently admired.</P>
<P>"The province of Penn&s;ylvania has a fine &s;oil, and through the importation of Germans, abounds with inha|bitants; but being a va&s;t inland country, its produce mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be brought to a market over a great extent of ground, and all by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and carriage. Hence it is, that Phi|ladelphia is crouded with waggons, carts, hor&s;es, and their drivers: a &s;tranger, at his fir&s;t entrance, would imagine it to be a place of traffic, beyond any one town in the colo|nies: while at New-York, in particular, to which the pro|duce of the country is all brought by water, there is more bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t, bu&s;ine&s;s of profit, though with le&s;s &s;how and appearance. Not a boat in our river is navigated with more than two, or three men at mo&s;t; and the&s;e are per|petually coming in from, and returning to, all parts of the adjacent country, in the &s;ame employments, that fill the city of Philadelphia with &s;ome hundreds of men, who, in re&s;pect to the public advantage, may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, to be laboriou&s;ly idle: for, let any one nicely compute the ex|pen&s;e of a waggon, with its tackling; the time of two men in attending it; their maintenance; four hor&s;es, and the charge of their provender, on a journey of one, though they often come, two hundred miles; and he will find, the&s;e &s;everal particulars amount to a &s;um far from being incon&s;iderable. All this time, the New York farmer is in the cour&s;e of his proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and the unincumbered acqui&s;itions of his calling; for, at a medium, there is &s;carce a farmer in the province, that cannot tran&s;port the fruits of a year's labour, from the be&s;t farm, in three days at a proper &s;ea&s;on, to &s;ome convenient landing, where the market will be to his &s;atisfaction, and all the wants from the merchant, cheaply &s;upplied; be&s;ides which, one boat &s;hall &s;teal into the harbour of New York, with a lading of more burden and value, than forty waggons, one hundred and &s;ixty hor&s;es, and eighty men, into Philadelphia; and perhaps with le&s;s noi&s;e, blu&s;ter, or &s;how than one.</P>
<P>"Prodigious is the advantage we have in this article
<PB N="223" REF="024800_0218_0FCD64181B5F7240">alone, I &s;hall not enter into an ab&s;tru&s;e calculation, to evince the exact value of it, in all the lights in which it may be con&s;idered. Thus much is certain, that barely on account of our ea&s;y carriage, the profits of farming with us, exceed tho&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania, at lea&s;t by thirty per cent. and that differ|ence, in favour of our farmers, is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to enrich them; while the others find the di&s;advantage they are expo|&s;ed to, &s;o heavy, (e&s;pecially the remote inhabitants of their country) that a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is all they can rea&s;onably hope to obtain. Take this province throughout, the expen&s;e of tran&s;porting a bu&s;hel of wheat, is but two pence for the di&s;tance of one hundred miles: but the &s;ame quantity, at a like di&s;tance in Penn&s;ylvania, will always exceed us one &s;hilling at lea&s;t. The proportion between us, in the conveyance of every thing el&s;e, is nearly the &s;ame. How great, then, are the incumbrances to which they are ex|po&s;ed! What an immen&s;e charge is &s;aved to us! how &s;en|&s;ible mu&s;t the embarra&s;&s;ments they are &s;ubject to, be to a trading people!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the inhabitants.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS province is not &s;o populous as &s;ome have imagined. Scarce a third part of it is under cultivation. The co|lony of Connecticut, which is va&s;tly inferior to this in its extent, contains, according to a late authentic enquiry, above 133,000 inhabitants, and has a militia of 27,000 men; but the militia of New-York, according to the general e&s;ti|mate, does not exceed 18,000. The whole number of &s;ouls is computed at 100,000.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="024800_0221_0FCD641E23A6E848">
Many have been the di&s;couragements to the &s;etlement of this colony. The French and Indian irruptions, to which we have always been expo&s;ed, have driven many families into New-Jer&s;ey. At home, the Briti&s;h acts for the tran|&s;portation of felons, have brought all the American colonies into di&s;credit with the indu&s;trious and hone&s;t poor, both in the kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland. The mi&s;chievous tendency of tho&s;e laws was &s;hown in a late paper, which it may not be improper to lay before the reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The independent reflector.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"It is too well known, that in pur&s;uance of divers acts of parliament, great numbers of fellows who have forfeited their lives to the public, for the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, are annually tran&s;ported from home to the&s;e plantations. Very &s;urpri&s;ing one would think, that thieves, burgla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, pickpockets, and cut-pur&s;es, and a he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the mo&s;t flagi|tious banditti upon earth, &s;hould be &s;ent as agreeable com|panions to us! That the &s;upreme legi&s;lature did intend a tran&s;portation to America, for a puni&s;hment of the&s;e vil|lains, I verily believe: but &s;o great is the mi&s;take, that confident I am, they are thereby, on the contrary, highly rewarded. For what, in God's name, can be more agreeable to a penurious wretch, driven, through nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;eek a livelihood by breaking of hou&s;es, and robbing upon the king's highway, than to be &s;aved from the halter, redeem|ed from the &s;tench of a jail, and tran&s;ported, pa&s;&s;age free, into a country, where, being unknown, no man can re|proach him with his crimes; where labour is high, a little of which will maintain him; and where all his expen&s;es will be moderate and low. There is &s;carce a thief in Eng|land, that would not rather be tran&s;ported than hanged. Life in any condition, but that of extreme mi&s;ery, will be preferred to death. As long, therefore, as there remains this wide door of e&s;cape, the number of thieves and robbers at home, will perpetually multiply, and their depredations be ince&s;&s;antly reiterated.</P>
<P>"But the acts were intended, for the better peopling the colonies. And will thieves and murderers be conducive to that end? what advantage can we reap from a colony of unre&s;trainable renegadoes? will they exalt the glory of the crown? or rather, will not the dignity of the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous monarch in the world, be &s;ullied by a province of &s;ub|jects &s;o lawle&s;s, dete&s;table, and ignominious? can agricul|ture be promoted, when the wild boar of the fore&s;t breaks
<PB N="227" REF="024800_0222_0FCD6420C5B54208">down our hedges and pulls up our vines? will trade flouri&s;h, or manufactures be encouraged, where property is made the &s;poil of &s;uch who are too idle to work, and wicked enough to murder and &s;teal?</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, are we not &s;ubjects of the &s;ame king, with the people of England&mdash;members of the &s;ame body politic, and therefore entitled to equal privileges with them? if &s;o, how injurious does it &s;eem to free one part of the dominions, from the plagues of mankind, and ca&s;t them upon another? Should a law be propo&s;ed, to take the poor of one pari&s;h, and billet them upon another, would not all the world, but the pari&s;h to be relieved, exclaim again&s;t &s;uch a project, as iniquitous and ab&s;urd? Should the numberle&s;s villains of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter be &s;uffered to e&s;cape from their pri&s;ons, to range at large, and depreda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e any other part of the kingdom, would not every man join with the &s;ufferers, and condemn the mea&s;ure as hard and unrea&s;onable? And though the hard&s;hips upon us, are indeed not equal to tho&s;e, yet the mi&s;eries that flow from laws, by no means intended to prejudice us, are too heavy, not to be felt. But the co|lonies mu&s;t be peopled. Agreed: and will the tran&s;portation acts ever have that tendency? no, they work the contra|ry way, and counteract their own de&s;ign. We want people, 'tis true, but not villains, ready at any time, encouraged by impanity, and habituated upon the flighte&s;t occa&s;ions, to our a man's throat, for a &s;mall part of his property. The delights of &s;uch company, is a noble inducement, indeed, to the hone&s;t poor, to convey them&s;elves into a &s;trange country. Amid&s;t all our plen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, they will have enough to exerci&s;e their virtues, and &s;tand in no need of the a&s;&s;ociation of &s;uch, as will prey upon their property, and gorge them|&s;elves with the blood of the adventurers. They came over in &s;earch of happine&s;s; rather than &s;tarve, will live any where, and would be glad to be excu&s;ed from &s;o afflicting an antepart of the torments of hell. In reality, &s;ir, the&s;e very laws, though otherwi&s;e de&s;igned, have turned out, in the end, the mo&s;t effectual expedients that the art of man could have contrived, to prevent the &s;ettlement of the&s;e remote parts of the king's dominions. They have actually taken away almo&s;t every encouragement to &s;o laud|able a de&s;ign. I appeal to facts. The body of the Engli&s;h are &s;truck wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> terror at the thought of coming over to us, not becau&s;e they have a va&s;t ocean to cro&s;s, or leave behind them their friends; or that the country is new and unculti|vated: but from the &s;hocking ideas, the mind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily form, of the company of inhuman &s;avages, and the
<PB N="228" REF="024800_0223_0FCD6421CE719220">more terrible herd of exiled malefactors. There are thou|&s;ands of hone&s;t men, labouring in Europe, at four pence a day, &s;tarving in &s;pite of all their efforts, a dead weight to the re&s;pective pari&s;hes to which they belong; who, with|out any other qualifications than common &s;en&s;e, health, and &s;trength, might accumulate e&s;tates among us, as many have done already. The&s;e, and not the others, are the men that &s;hould be &s;ent over, for the better peopling the planta|tions. Great-Britain and Ireland, in their pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, are over&s;tocked with them; and he who would immortalize him&s;elf, for a lover of mankind, &s;hould con|cert a &s;cheme for the tran&s;portation of the indu&s;triou&s;ly hone&s;t abroad, and the immediate puni&s;hment of rogues and plunderers at home. The pale-faced, half-clad, meagre, and &s;tarved &s;keletons, that are &s;een in every village of tho&s;e kingdoms, call loudly for the patriot's generous aid. The plantations, too, would thank him for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in ob|taining the repeal of tho&s;e laws, which, though otherwi&s;e intended by the legi&s;lature, have &s;o unhappily proved in|jurious to his own country, and ruinous to us.&mdash;It is not long &s;ince a bill pa&s;&s;ed the commons, for the employment of &s;uch criminals in his maje&s;ty's docks, as &s;hould merit the gallows. The de&s;ign was good. It is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy, that all tho&s;e, who have forfeited their liberty and lives to their country, &s;hould be compelled to labour the re&s;idue of their days in its &s;ervice. But the &s;cheme was bad, and wi&s;ely was the bill rejected by the lords, for this only rea&s;on, that it had a natural tendency to di&s;credit the king's yards: the con&s;equences of which mu&s;t have been prejudi|cial to the whole nation. Ju&s;t &s;o ought we to rea&s;on in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and we &s;hould then &s;oon be brought to con|clude, that though peopling the colonies, which was the laudable motive of the legi&s;lature, be expedient to the public; abrogating the tran&s;portation laws, mu&s;t be equal|ly nece&s;&s;ary</P>
<P>The bigotry and tyranny of &s;ome of our governors, to|gether with the great extent of their grants, may al&s;o be con&s;idered among the di&s;couragements again&s;t the full &s;et|tlement of the province. Mo&s;t of the&s;e gentlemen com|ing over with no other view than to rai&s;e their own fortunes, i&s;&s;ued extravagant patents, charged with &s;mall quit rents, to &s;uch as were able to &s;erve them in a&s;|&s;embly: and the&s;e patentees being generally men of e&s;|tates, have rated their lands &s;o exorbitantly high, that very few poor per&s;ons could either purcha&s;e or lea&s;e them. Add to all the&s;e, that the New-England planters have always been di&s;affected to the Dutch, nor was there, after the &s;urren|der
<PB N="229" REF="024800_0224_0FCD6423AAC23290">any foreign acce&s;&s;ion from the Netherlands. The pro|vince being thus poorly inhabited, the price of labour be|came &s;o enormou&s;ly enhanced, that we have been con&s;train|ed to import negroes from Africa, who are employed in all kinds of &s;ervitude and trades.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h is the mo&s;t prevailing language among us, but not a little corrupted by the Dutch dialect, which is &s;till &s;o much u&s;ed in &s;ome counties, that the &s;heriffs find it difficult to obtain per&s;ons &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Engli&s;h tongue, to &s;erve as jurors in the courts of law.</P>
<P>The manners of the people differ, as well as their lan|guage. In Suffolk and Queen's county, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of which were either natives of England, or the immediate de&s;cendants of &s;uch as began the plantations in the ea&s;tern colonies, their cu&s;toms are &s;imilar to tho&s;e prevailing in the Engli&s;h counties, from whence they originally &s;prang. In the city of New-York, through our intercour&s;e with Europe|ans, we follow the London fa&s;hions; though, by the time we adopt them, they become di&s;u&s;ed in England. Our af|fluence during the late war, introduced a degree of luxury in tables, dre&s;s and furniture, with which we were before un|acquainted. But &s;till we are not &s;o gay a people as our neigh|bours at Bo&s;ton and &s;everal of the &s;outhern colonies. The Dutch counties, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, follow the example of New-York, but &s;till retain many modes peculiar to the Hol|landers.</P>
<P>The city of New-York con&s;i&s;ts principally of merchants, &s;hopkeepers, and trade&s;men, who &s;u&s;tain the reputation of hone&s;t, punctual and fair dealers. With re&s;pect to riches, there is not &s;o great an inequality among us, as is common in Bo&s;ton, and in &s;ome other places. Every man of indu&s;try and integrity has it in his power to live well, and many are the in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who came here di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their po|verty, who now enjoy ea&s;y and plentiful fortunes.</P>
<P>New-York is one of the mo&s;t &s;ocial places on the contin|ent. The men collect them&s;elves into weekly evening clubs. The ladies, in winter, are frequently entertained either at concerts of mu&s;ic or a&s;&s;emblies, and make a very good ap|pearance. They are comely, and dre&s;s well; and &s;carce any of them have di&s;torted &s;hapes. Tinctured with a Dutch edu|cation, they manage their families with becoming par&s;i|mony, good providence, and &s;ingular neatne&s;s. The prac|tice of extravagant gaming, common to the fa&s;hionable part of the fair &s;ex, in &s;ome places, is a vice with which my countrywomen cannot ju&s;tly be charged. There is nothing they &s;o generally neglect, as reading, and indeed all the arts
<PB N="230" REF="024800_0225_0FCD6425AFB3D290">for the improvement of the mind, in which, I confe&s;s, we have &s;et them the example. They are mode&s;t, temperate, and charitable; naturally &s;prightly, &s;en&s;ible, and good-hu|moured; and, by the help of a more elevated education, would po&s;&s;e&s;s all the accompli&s;hments de&s;irable in the &s;ex. Our &s;chools are in the lowe&s;t order; the in&s;tructors want in&s;truction, and through a long, &s;hameful neglect of all the arts and &s;ciences, our common &s;peech is extremely corrupt; and the evidences of a bad ta&s;te, both as to thought and language, are vi&s;ible in all our proceedings, public and private.</P>
<P>The people, both in town and country, are &s;ober, indu&s;|trious, and ho&s;pitable, though intent upon gain. The richer &s;ort keep very plentiful tables, abounding with great varieties of fle&s;h, fi&s;h, fowl, and all kinds of vegetables. The com|mon drinks are beer, cyder, weak punch, and Madeira wine. For de&s;ert, we have fruits in va&s;t plenty, of different kinds and various &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of e&s;tates rarely re&s;ide in the country, and hence few or no experiments have yet been made in agricul|ture. The farms being large, our hu&s;bandmen, for that rea|&s;on, have little recour&s;e to art for manuring and improv|ing their lands; but it is &s;aid, that nature has furni&s;hed us with &s;ufficient helps, whenever nece&s;&s;ity calls us to u&s;e them. It is much owing to the di&s;proportion between the number of our inhabitants, and the va&s;t tracts remaining &s;till to be &s;ettled, that we have, as yet, entered, upon &s;carce any other manufactures, than &s;uch as are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for our home convenience. Felt-making, which is perhaps the mo&s;t natural of any we could fall upon, was begun &s;ome years ago; and hats were exported to the We&s;t Indies with great &s;ucce&s;s, till lately prohibited by an act of parlia|ment.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this colony are in general healthy and robu&s;t, taller but &s;horter lived than Europeans, and, both with re&s;pect to their minds and bodies, arrive &s;ooner to an age of maturity. Breathing a &s;erene, dry air, they are more &s;prightly in their natural tempers, than the people of Eng|land; and hence in&s;tances of &s;uicide are here very uncom|mon. The hi&s;tory of our di&s;ea&s;es belongs to a profe&s;&s;ion with which I am very little acquainted. Few phy&s;icians among&s;t us are eminent for their &s;kill. Quacks abound like locu&s;ts in Egypt: and too many have recommended them&s;elves to a full practice and profitable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This is the le&s;s to be wondered at, as the profe&s;&s;ion is under no kind of regu|lation. Load as the call is, to our &s;hame be it remembered,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of our trade.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ituation of New-York with re&s;pect to foreign mar|kets, for rea&s;ons el&s;ewhere a&s;&s;igned, is to be preferred to any of our colonies. It lies in the centre of the Briti&s;h plantations on the continent, has at all times a &s;hort, ea&s;y acce&s;s to the ocean, and commands almo&s;t the whole trade of Connecticut and New-Jer&s;ey, two fertile and well-cul|tivated colonies. The projection of Cape Cod into the Atlantic, renders the navigation from the former to Bo&s;|ton, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, extremely perilous; and &s;ometimes the coa&s;ters are driven off, and compelled to winter in the We&s;t-Indies. But the conveyance to New-York, from the ea&s;tward through the &s;ound, is &s;hort and unexpo&s;ed to &s;uch dangers. Philadelphia receives as little advantage from New-Jer&s;ey, as Bo&s;ton from Connecticut, becau&s;e the only rivers which roll through that province, di&s;embogue not many miles from the very city of New-York. Several at|tempts have been made to rai&s;e Perth Amboy into a trading port; but hitherto it has proved to be an unfea&s;ible project. New-York, all things con&s;idered, has a much better &s;itua|tion, and were it otherwi&s;e, the city has become too rich and con&s;iderable, to be eclip&s;ed by any other town in its neigh|bourhood.</P>

Our merchants are compared to a hive of bees, who in|du&s;triou&s;ly gather honey for others&mdash;<HI>non vobis me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i ficatis apes.</HI> The profits of our trade centre chiefly in Great-Bri|tain, and for that rea&s;on, methinks, among others, we ought always to receive the generous aid and protection of our mo|ther country. In our traffic with other places, the balance is almo&s;t con&s;tantly in our favour. Our exports to the We&s;t Indies are bread, pea&s;e, rye-meal, Indian corn, apples, oni|ons, boards, &s;taves, hor&s;es, &s;heep, butter, chee&s;e, pickled oy&s;ters, beef, and pork. Flour is al&s;o a main article, of which there is &s;hipped about 80,000 barrels per annum. To pre&s;erve the credit of this important branch of our &s;taple, we have a good law, appointing officers to in&s;pect and brand every ca&s;k before its exportation. The returns are chiefly rum, &s;ugar, and mela&s;&s;es, except ca&s;h from Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acoa, and when mules, from the Spani&s;h main, are ordered to Jamaica, and the windward i&s;lands, which are generally exchanged for their natural produce; for we receive but lit|tle ca&s;h from our own i&s;lands. The balance again&s;t them would be much more in our favour, if the indulgence to our &s;ugar colonies, did not enable them to &s;ell their produce at a higher rate than either the Dutch or French i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Spaniards commonly contract for provi&s;ions, with merchants in this and the colony of Penn&s;ylvania, very much to the advantage both of the contractors and the pub|lic, becau&s;e the returns are wholly in ca&s;h. Our wheat, flour, Indian corn, and lumber &s;hipped to Li&s;bon and Madeira, ba|lance the Madeira wine imported here.</P>
<P>The logwood trade to the bay of Honduras is very con&s;i|derable, and was pu&s;hed by our merchants with great bold|ne&s;s in the mo&s;t dangerous times. The exportation of flax|&s;eed to Ireland is of late very much increa&s;ed. Between the 9th of December 1755, and the 23d of February following, we &s;hipped off 12, 528 hog&s;heads. In return for this article, linens are imported, and bills of exch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nge drawn, in favour of England, to pay for the dry goods we purcha&s;e there. Our logwood is remitted to the Engli&s;h merchants for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r trade, though very much impaired by French wiles and encroachments, ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;i|lence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is computed that formerly, we exported 150 hog&s;|heads of beaver and other fine f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, per annum, and 200 hog&s;heads of Indian-dre&s;&s;ed deer-&s;kins, be&s;ides tho&s;e carri|ed from Albany into New-England. Skins undre&s;&s;ed are u&s;ually &s;hipped to Holland.</NOTE> The building of O&s;wego, has conduced more than any thing el&s;e to the pre&s;ervation of this trade. Peltry of
<PB N="233" REF="024800_0228_0FCD642C4C33FE30">all kinds is purcha&s;ed with rum, ammuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, blankets, &s;trouds, and wampum, or conque-&s;hell bugles. The French fur trade, at Albany, was carried on till the &s;ummer 1755; by the Caghnuaga pro&s;elytes; and in return for their peltry, they received Spani&s;h pieces of eight, and &s;ome other arti|cles which the French want, to complete their a&s;&s;ortment of Indian goods. For the &s;avages prefer the Engli&s;h &s;trouds to theirs: and the French found it their intere&s;t to purcha&s;e them of us, and tran&s;port them to the we&s;tern Indians on the lakes Erie, Huron, and at the &s;treight of Mi&s;&s;ilima|kinac.</P>
<P>Our importation of dry goods from England is &s;o va&s;tly great, that we are obliged to betake our&s;elves to all po&s;&s;i|ble arts, to make remittances to the Briti&s;h merchants. It is for this purpo&s;e we import cotton from St. Thomas's and Surinam&mdash;lime-juice and Nicaragua wood from Curacoa&mdash;and logwood from the bay, &amp;c. and yet it drains us of all the &s;ilver and gold we can collect. It is computed, that the an|nual amount of the goods purcha&s;ed by this colony in Great Britain, is in value not le&s;s than 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling; and the &s;um would be much greater, if a &s;top was put to all clande&s;tine trade. England is, doubtle&s;s, entitled to all our &s;uperfluities; becau&s;e our general intere&s;ts are clo&s;ely con|nected, and her navy is our principal defence. On this ac|count, the trade with Hamburgh and Holland for duck, chequered linen, oznabrigs, cordage, and tea, is certainly, upon the whole, impolitic and unrea&s;onable; how much &s;o|ever it may conduce to advance the intere&s;t of a few mer|chants, or this particular colony.</P>
<P>By what mea&s;ures this contraband trade may be effectual|ly ob&s;tructed, is hard to determine, though it well de&s;erves the attention of a Briti&s;h parliament. Increa&s;ing the num|ber of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, will be a remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. Their &s;alaries would be an additional charge upon the public; for if we argue from their conduct, we ought not to pre&s;ume upon their fidelity. The exclu&s;ive right of the Ea&s;t-India company to import tea, while the colonies purcha&s;e it of foreigners 30 per cent. cheaper, mu&s;t be very prejudicial to the nation. Our people, both in town and country, are &s;hamefully gone into the habit of tea-drinking: and it is &s;uppo&s;ed we con&s;ume of this com|modity in value near 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling per annum.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="024800_0229_0FCD642FA0A423E0">
Some are of opinion, that the fi&s;hery of &s;turgeons; which abound in Hud&s;on's river, might be improved to the great advantage of the colony; and that, if proper mea&s;ures were concerted, much profit would ari&s;e from &s;hip-building and naval &s;tores. It is certain we have timber in va&s;t plenty, oak, white and black pines, fir, locu&s;t, red and white mulberry, and cedar; and perhaps there is no &s;oil on the globe, fitter for the production of hemp, than the low lands in the county of Albany. To what I have already &s;aid concerning iron ore, a nece&s;&s;ary article, I &s;hall add an ex|tract from the independent reflector.</P>
<P>"It is generally believed, that this province abounds with a variety of minerals. Of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ron in particular we have &s;uch plenty, as to be excelled by no country in the world of equal extent. It is a metal of intrin&s;ic value beyond any other, and preferable to the pure&s;t gold. The former is converted into numberle&s;s forms, for as many indi&s;pen&s;ible u&s;es; the latter, for its portablene&s;s and &s;carcity, is only fit for a medium of trade: but iron is a branch of it, and I am per|&s;uaded, will, one time or other, be one of the mo&s;t valuable articles of our commerce. Our annual exports to Bo&s;ton, Rhode-I&s;land, and Connecticut, and, &s;ince the late act of parliament, to England, are far from being incon&s;iderable. The bodies of iron ore, in the northern parts of this pro|vince, are &s;o many, their quality &s;o good, and their &s;ituati|on &s;o convenient, in re&s;pect of wood, water, hearth-&s;tone, proper fluxes, and carriage, for furnaces, bloomeries, and forges, that with a little attention we might very &s;oon rival the Swedes in the produce of this article. If any American attempts in iron works have proved abortive, and di&s;ap|pointed their undertakers, it is not to be imputed either to the quality of the ore, or a defect of conveniences. The want of more workmen, and the villainy of tho&s;e we gene|rally have, are the only cau&s;es to which we mu&s;t attribute &s;uch mi&s;carriages. No man, who has been concerned in them will di&s;agree with me, if I a&s;&s;ert, that from the founder of the furnace to the meane&s;t bank&s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, or jobber, they are u&s;ually low, profligate, drunken, and faithle&s;s. And yet, under all the innumerable di&s;advantages of &s;uch in&s;truments, very large e&s;tates have, in this way, been rai&s;ed in &s;ome of our colonies. Our &s;ucce&s;s, therefore, in the iron manufac|tory, is ob&s;tructed and di&s;couraged by the want of work|men, and the high price of labour, its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, and by the&s;e alone; but 'tis our happine&s;s, that &s;uch only being the cau&s;e, the means of redre&s;s are entire|ly in our own hands. Nothing more is wanting to open a
<PB N="235" REF="024800_0230_0FCD6432A1A10628">va&s;t &s;und of riches to the province, in this branch of trade, than the importation of foreigners. If our merchants and landed gentlemen could be brought to a coalition in this de|&s;ign, their private intere&s;ts would not be better advanced by it, than the public emolument; the latter, in particular, would thereby va&s;tly improve their lands, increa&s;e the num|ber and rai&s;e the rents of their tenants. And I cannot but think, that if tho&s;e gentlemen, who are too inactive to engage in &s;uch an enterpri&s;e, would only be at the pains of drawing up full repre&s;entations of their advantages for iron works, and of publi&s;hing them from time to time, in Great-Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Sweden; the province would &s;oon be &s;upplied, with a &s;ufficient number of capable workmen in all the branches of that manufactory."</P>
<P>The money u&s;ed in this province is &s;ilver, gold, Briti&s;h halfpence, and bills of credit. To counterfeit either of them is felony without benefit of clergy; but none, except the latter, and Lion dollars, are a legal tender. Twelve half|pence, till lately, pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;hilling; which being much beyond their value in any of the neighbouring colonies, the a&s;&s;embly, in 1753, re&s;olved to proceed, at their next meeting, after the 1&s;t of May en&s;uing, to the con&s;ideration of a method for a&s;certaining their value. A &s;et of gentlemen, in number &s;eventy-two, took the advantage of the di&s;credit that re&s;olve put upon copper halfpence, and on the 22d of December, &s;ub&s;cribed a paper, engaging not to receive or pa&s;s them, except at the rate of fourteen coppers to a &s;hil|ling. This gave ri&s;e to a mob, for a few days, among the lower cla&s;s of people; but &s;ome of them being impri&s;oned, the &s;cheme was carried into execution, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of the province, without the aid of a law. Our paper bills, which are i&s;&s;ued to &s;erve the exigencies of the government, were at fir&s;t equal to an ounce of &s;ilver, then valued at eight &s;hillings. Before the late Spani&s;h war, &s;ilver and gold were in great demand, to make remittances for Eu|ropean goods, and then the bills &s;unk, an ounce of &s;ilver be|ing worth nine &s;hillings and three pence. During the war, the credit of our bills was well &s;upported, partly by the num|ber of prizes taken by our privateers, and the high price of our produce abroad; and partly by the logwood trade and the depreciation of the New-England paper money, which gave ours a free circulation through the ea&s;tern colonies. Since the war, &s;ilver has been valued at about nine &s;hillings and two pence an ounce, and is doubtle&s;s fixed there, till our imports exceed what we export. To a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty for removing the late encroachments of the French, we have
<PB N="236" REF="024800_0231_0FCD6434415B1B60">i&s;&s;ued 80,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to be &s;unk in &s;hort periods, by a tax on e&s;tates real and per&s;onal; and the whole amount of our paper cur|rency is thought to be about 160,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>Never was the trade of this province in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition, as at the latter end of the late French war. Above twenty privateers were often out of this port at a time; and they were very &s;ucce&s;sful in their captures. Provi&s;ions, which are our &s;taple. bore a high price in the We&s;t Indies. The French, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed through a want of them, gladly received our flags of truce, though &s;ometimes they had but one or two pri&s;oners on board, becau&s;e they were always loaded with flour, beef, pork, and &s;uch like com|modities. The danger their own ve&s;&s;els were expo&s;ed to, induced them to &s;ell their &s;ugars to us at a very low rate. A trade was, at the &s;ame time, carried on between Jamaica and the Spani&s;h main, which opened a fine market to the northern colonies, and the returns were, principally, in ca&s;h. It was generally thought, that if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had con|tinued, the greate&s;t part of the produce of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pani&s;h and French &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tran&s;ported to Great Britain, through &s;ome one or other of her colonies; whence we may fairly argue their prodigious importance.</P>
<P>The provincial laws relating to our trade are not very numerous. Tho&s;e concerned in them, may have recour&s;e to the late edition of our acts at large, publi&s;hed in 1752; and for this rea&s;on, I beg to be excu&s;ed from exhibiting an unentertaining &s;ummary of them in this work.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of our religious &s;tate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the acount already given, of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the acts for &s;ettling a mini&s;try in four counties, and the ob&s;ervations made concerning our various chri&s;tian denominations, I have in a great mea&s;ure anticipated what I at fir&s;t intended to have ranged under this head.</P>
<P>The principal di&s;tinctions among us, are the epi&s;copali|ans, and the Dutch and Engli&s;h pre&s;byterians; the two la&s;t, together with all the other prote&s;tants in he colony, are &s;ometimes (perhaps here improperly) called by the ge|neral name of di&s;&s;enters; and, compared to them, the epi&s;copalians are, I believe, &s;carce in the proportion of one to fifteen. Hence partly ari&s;es the general di&s;content on ac|count of the mini&s;try acts; not &s;o much that the provi&s;ion
<PB N="237" REF="024800_0232_0FCD64356665CDB0">made by them is engro&s;&s;ed by the minor &s;ect, as becau&s;e the body of the people are for an equal, univer&s;al tolera|tion of prote&s;tants, and utterly aver&s;e to any kind of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment. The di&s;&s;enters, though fearle&s;s of each other, are all jealous of the epi&s;copal party, being apprehen&s;ive that the countenance they may have from home, will foment a lu&s;t for dominion, and enable them, in proce&s;s of time, to &s;ubjugate and oppre&s;s their fellow &s;ubjects. The violent mea&s;ures of &s;ome of our governors have given an alarm to their fears; and if ever any other gentleman, who may be honoured with the chief command of the province, begins to divert him&s;elf, by retrenching the privileges and immunities they now enjoy, the con|fu&s;ion of the province will be the unavoidable con&s;equence of his folly. For though his maje&s;ty has no other &s;ubjects upon who&s;e loyalty he can more firmly depend, yet an ab|horrence of per&s;ecution, under any of its appearances, is &s;o deeply rooted in the people of this plantation; that as long as they continue their numbers and intere&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly, no attempt will probably be made upon the rights of con&s;cience, without endangering the public repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the government of the Dutch churches, I have al|ready given an account. As to the epi&s;copal clergy, they are mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Engli&s;h &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, and ordinarily ordained by the bi&s;hop of London, who, having a commi&s;&s;ion from the king to exerci&s;e eccle|&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, commonly appoints a clergyman here for his commi&s;&s;ary. The mini&s;ters are called by the parti|cular churches, and maintained by the voluntary contribu|tion of their auditors and the &s;ociety's annual allowance, there being no law for tythes.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h pre&s;byterians are very numerous. Tho&s;e in|habiting New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, and the three Delaware counties, are regularly formed, after the manner of the church of Scotland, into con&s;i&s;tories or kirk &s;e&s;&s;ions, pre&s;byteries and &s;ynods, and will probably &s;oon join in erecting a general a&s;&s;embly. The clergy are ordain|ed by their fellows, and maintained by their re&s;pective congregations. I except tho&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries among the In|dians, who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is paid by the &s;ociety in Scotland for propagating chri&s;tian knowledge. None of the pre&s;by|terian churches in this province are incorporated, as is the ca&s;e of many in New Jer&s;ey. Their judicatories are upon a very proper e&s;tabli&s;hment, for they have no authority by legal &s;anctions to enforce their decrees. Nor indeed is
<PB N="238" REF="024800_0233_0FCD6436D3BB21D8">any religious &s;ect, among us, legally inve&s;ted with powerd prejudicial to the common privileges of the re&s;t. The do|minion of all our clergy is, as it ought to be, merely &s;pi|ritual. The epi&s;copalians, however, &s;ometimes pretend, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment in South Britain extends here; but the whole body of the di&s;&s;enters are aver&s;e to the doctrine. The point has been di&s;puted with great fer|vour, and the &s;um of the arguments again&s;t it is contained in a late paper, which I &s;hall lay before the reader, at large, without any additional refle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions.</P>

<P>Whether the church of England is equally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, as in the &s;outhern parts of Great Britain, is a que&s;tion that has often been controverted. Tho&s;e who hold the affirmative, have drawn a long train of con&s;equences in favour of the epi&s;copalians, taking it for granted, that the truth is on their &s;ide. The pre&s;byterians, independents, congregationali&s;ts, anabapti&s;ts, quakers, and all tho&s;e among us, who, in England, would fall under the general denomi|nation of di&s;&s;enters, are warm in the negative. I beg le&abreve;ve, therefore, to interpo&s;e in the debate; and as I promi&s;ed, in the introduction to the&s;e papers, to vindicate the reli|gious, as well as civil rights and privileges of my country|men; I &s;hall devote this paper to a con&s;ideration of &s;o im|portant a point: to which I am the more &s;trongly inclined, becau&s;e &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment has often been urged again&s;t the &s;cheme I have propo&s;ed for the con&s;titution of our college. My opinion is, that the notion of a general religious e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in this province, is entirely groundle&s;s. Accord|ing to the &s;trict rules of controver&s;y, the <HI>onus probandi,</HI> or the burden of the proof, lies upon tho&s;e who affirm the po|&s;ition; and it would therefore be &s;ufficient for me barely to deny it. I &s;hall, neverthele&s;s, wave the advantage of this rule of the &s;chools; and, as becomes an impartial advocate for truth, proceed to &s;tate the arguments, which are gene|rally urged in &s;upport of an e&s;tabli&s;hment. I &s;hall then &s;how
<PB N="239" REF="024800_0234_0FCD64384D5813A0">their in&s;ufficiency, and conclude with the particular rea&s;ons upon which my opinion is founded.</P>
<P>They who a&s;&s;ert, that the church of England is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in this province, never, that I have heard of, pretend|ed that it owes its e&s;tabli&s;hment to any provincial law of our own making. Nor, indeed, is there the lea&s;t ground for &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. The acts, that e&s;tabli&s;h a mini&s;try in this, and three other counties, do not affect the whole co|lony; and therefore can by no means be urged in &s;upport of a general e&s;tabli&s;hment. Nor were they originally de|&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h the epi&s;copalians in preference or exclu|&s;ion of any other prote&s;tants in tho&s;e counties to which they are limited. But as the propo&s;ition is, that the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the church of England is equally binding here, as in England; &s;o, agreeable thereto, the arguments they ad|duce are the following:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That as we are an Engli&s;h colony, the con&s;titu|tional laws of our mother country, antecedent to the legi&s;|lature of our own, are binding upon us; and therefore at the planting of this colony, the Engli&s;h religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ment immediately took place.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the act, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the epi&s;copal church in South Britain, previous to the union of England and Scotland, extends to, and equally affects, all the colo|nies.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the only arguments that can be offered with the lea&s;t plau&s;ibility; and if they are &s;hown to be incon|clu&s;ive, the po&s;ition is di&s;proved, and the arguments, of con&s;equence, mu&s;t be impertinent and groundle&s;s. I &s;hall begin with the examination of the fir&s;t: and here it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, for undoubted law, that every new colony, till it has a legi&s;lature of its own, is, in general, &s;ubject to the laws of the country from which it originally &s;prang. But that all of them, without di&s;tinction, are to be &s;uppo&s;ed binding upon &s;uch planters, is neither agreeable to law nor rea&s;on. The laws which they carry with them, and to which they are &s;ubject, are &s;uch as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the original intention of our entering into a &s;tate of &s;ociety&mdash;&s;uch as are requi&s;ite, in their new colony &s;tate, for the advancement of their and the general pro&s;|perity &mdash;&s;uch, without which they will neither be protected in their lives, liberty, or property: and the true rea&s;on of their being con&s;idered, even &s;ubject to &s;uch laws, ari&s;es from the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of their being under &s;ome kind of government, their &s;upporting a colony relation and depen|dence, and the evident fitne&s;s of their &s;ubjection to the
<PB N="240" REF="024800_0235_0FCD643D576931D0">laws of their mother country, with which alone they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted. Even at this day, we extend every general act of parliament which we think rea&s;onable and &s;it for us, though it was neither de&s;igned to be a law upon us, nor has words to include us, and has even been enacted long &s;ince we had a legi&s;lature of our own. This is a prac|tice we have introduced for our conveniency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This practice is very dangerous, and is a&s;&s;uming little le&s;s than a legi&s;lative authority.</NOTE>; but that the Engli&s;h laws, &s;o far as I have di&s;tingui&s;hed them, &s;hould be binding upon us, antecedent to our having a legi&s;lature of our own, is of ab&s;olute unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity. But no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity can be pretended, in favour of the introduction of any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment what&s;oever; becau&s;e, it is evident that different &s;ocieties do exi&s;t with different eccle|&s;ia&s;tical laws, or, which is &s;ufficient to my purpo&s;e, with|out &s;uch as the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that civil &s;ocie|ty, as it is antecedent to any eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments, is in its nature unconnected with them, independent of them, and all &s;ocial happine&s;s completely attainable without them.</P>
<P>Secondly, To &s;uppo&s;e all the laws of England, without di&s;tinction, obligatory upon every new colony, at its im|plantation, is ab&s;urd, and would effectually prevent the &s;ubjects from undertaking &s;o hazardous an adventure. Upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, a thou&s;and laws will be introduced, in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tate of a new country, and de&s;tructive of the planters. To u&s;e the words of the late attorney ge|neral, &s;ir Dudley Ryder<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Afterwards lord chief ju&s;tice of the king's bench. The&s;e were his words, in an opinion again&s;t the extent of the &s;tatute of frauds and perjuries.</NOTE>, "It would be acting the part of an un&s;kilful phy&s;ician, who &s;hould pre&s;cribe the &s;ame do&s;e to every patient, without di&s;tingui&s;hing the variety of di&s;|tempers and con&s;titutions." According to this doctrine, we are &s;ubject to the payment of tythes, ought to have a &s;piri|tual court, and impoveri&s;hed, as the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the pro|vince mu&s;t have been, they were yet liable to the payment of the land tax. And had this been the &s;en&s;e of our rulers, and their conduct conformable thereto, &s;carce ever would our colonies have appeared in their pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing condi|tion; e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered, that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of mo&s;t of them, &s;ought an exemption in the&s;e American wilds, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment to which they were &s;ubject at home.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="024800_0236_0FCD643E5E7735A8">
Thirdly, If the planters of every new colony carry with them the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country from whence they migrate; it follows, that if a colony had been planted when the Engli&s;h nation were pagans, the e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;uch colony mu&s;t be pagani&s;m alone: and, in like manner, had this colony been planted while popery was e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, the religion of papi&s;ts mu&s;t have been our e&s;|tabli&s;hed religion; and if it is our duty to conform to the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed at home, we are equally bound, again&s;t con&s;cience and the bible, to be pagans, papi&s;ts, or pro|te&s;tants, according to the particular religion they &s;hall plea&s;e to adopt. A doctrine that can never be urged, but with a very ill grace indeed, by any prote&s;tant mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If the church of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;hed in this colony, it mu&s;t either be founded on acts of parliament, or the common law. That it is not e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fir&s;t, I &s;hall prove in the &s;equel; and that it cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the common law, appears from the following con&s;ider|ations.</P>
<P>The common law of England, properly defined, con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e general laws to which the Engli&s;h have been accu&s;tom|ed, from time, whereof there is no memory to the contrary: and every law, deriving its validity from &s;uch immemorial cu&s;tom, mu&s;t be carried back as far as to the reign of Richard I. who&s;e death happened on the 6th of April 1199. But the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England was not till the fifth year of queen Anne. And hence it is apparent, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England; can never be argued from the common law, even in England; nor could be any part of it, &s;ince it depends not for its validity upon cu&s;tom immemorial. And therefore, though it be admitted, that every Engli&s;h colony is &s;ubject to the common law of the realm, it by no means follows, that the church of Eng|land is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies; becau&s;e, the common law knows of no &s;uch religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, nor con&s;iders any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment whatever, as any part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. It does, indeed, encourage religion; but that, and a particular church government, are things entirely different.</P>
<P>I proceed now to a con&s;ideration of the &s;econd argument in&s;i&s;ted on, to prove an epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the colo|nies, founded on the act which e&s;tabli&s;hed the church of England, pa&s;&s;ed in the fifth year of queen Anne, recited and ratified in the act for an union of the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. And that this act does not e&s;tabli&s;h the church of England in the colonies, has been &s;o fully
<PB N="242" REF="024800_0237_0FCD643FD1E67560">&s;hown by mr. Hobart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mini&s;ter of one of the churches at Fairfield, in Con|necticut.</NOTE>, in his &s;econd addre&s;s to the epi&s;co|pal &s;eparation in New England, that I &s;hall content my&s;elf with an extract from the works of that ingenious gentle|man, which, with very little alteration, is as follows:</P>
<P>"The act we are now di&s;puting about, was made in the fifth year of queen Anne, and is entitled, an act for &s;ecu|ring the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. The oc|ca&s;ion of the &s;tatute was this: the parliament in Scotland, when treating of an union with England, were apprehen|&s;ive of its endangering their eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment. Scotland was to have but a &s;mall &s;hare in the legi&s;lature of Great Britain, but forty-five members in the hou&s;e of com|mons, which con&s;i&s;ts of above five hundred; and but &s;ix|teen in the hou&s;e of lords, which then con&s;i&s;ted of near an hundred, and might be increa&s;ed by the &s;overeign at plea|&s;ure. The Scots, therefore, to prevent having their eccle&s;i|a&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment repealed in a Briti&s;h parliament, where they might be &s;o ea&s;ily out-voted by the Engli&s;h members, pa&s;&s;ed an act, previous to the union, e&s;tabli&s;hing the pre&s;byterian church within the kingdom of Scotland, in perpetuity, and made this act an e&s;&s;ential and funda|mental part of the union, which might not be repealed, or altered by any &s;ub&s;equent Briti&s;h parliament; and this put the Engli&s;h parliament upon pa&s;&s;ing this act for &s;ecuring the church of England. Neither of them de&s;igned to en|large the bounds of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, or extend their e&s;tabli&s;hment farther than it reached before, but only to &s;ecure and perpetuate it, in its then pre&s;ent ex|tent. This is evident, not only from the occa&s;ion of the act, but from the charitable temper the Engli&s;h parlia|ment was under the influence of, when they pa&s;&s;ed it. The lord North and Grey offered a rider to be added to the bill for an union, viz. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it might not extend to an appro|bation or acknowledgment of the truth of the pre&s;byterian way of wor&s;hip, or allowing the religion of the church of Scotland to be what it is &s;tiled, the true prote&s;tant religion. But this clau&s;e was rejected. A parliament that would ac|knowledge the religion of the church of Scotland, to be the true prote&s;tant religion, and allow their acts to extend to an approbation of the pre&s;byterian way of wor&s;hip, though they might think it be&s;t to &s;ecure and perpetuate the church of England within tho&s;e bounds, wherein it was before
<PB N="243" REF="024800_0238_0FCD6441693817F0">e&s;tabli&s;hed, can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;igned to extend it beyond them.</P>
<P>"The title of the act is exactly agreeable to what we have &s;aid of the de&s;ign of it, and of the temper of the par|liament that pa&s;&s;ed it. 'Tis entitled, an act not for enlarg|ing, but for &s;ecuring the church of England, and that not in the American plantations, but as it is now by law e&s;tab|li&s;hed; which plainly means no more than to perpetuate it within its ancient boundaries.</P>
<P>"The provi&s;ion, made in the act it&s;elf, is well adapted to this de&s;ign; for it enacts, that the act of the thirteenth of Elizabeth, and the act of uniformity, pa&s;&s;ed in the thir|teenth year of Charles II. and all and &s;ingular other acts of parliament, then in force for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;er|vation of the church of England, &s;hould remain in full force forever; and that every &s;ucceeding &s;overeign &s;hould, at his coronation, take and &s;ub&s;cribe an oath to main|tain and pre&s;erve inviolably the &s;aid &s;ettlement of the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, within the king|doms of England and Ireland, the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the territories there|unto belonging. This act doth not u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, as would have been proper and even nece&s;&s;ary, had the de&s;ign been to have made a new e&s;tabli&s;hment; but only &s;uch as are proper to ratify and confirm an old one. The &s;ettlement, which the king is &s;worn to pre&s;erve, is re|pre&s;ented as exi&s;ting previou&s;ly to the pa&s;&s;ing this act, and not as made by it. The words of the oath are, to maintain and pre&s;erve inviolably the &s;aid &s;ettlement. If it be a&s;ked, what &s;ettlement? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, a &s;ettlement here|tofore made and confirmed by certain &s;tatutes, which, for the greater certainty and &s;ecurity, are enumerated in this act, and declared to be unalterable. This is the &s;ettlement the king is &s;worn to pre&s;erve; and this &s;ettlement has no relation to us in America. For the act, which originally made it, did not reach hither; and this act, which perpetu|ates them, does not extend them to us.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;take to imagine, that the word territories ne|ce&s;&s;arily means the&s;e American colonies. "The&s;e countries are u&s;ually, in law, as well as other writings, &s;tiled colonies or plantations, and not territories. An in&s;tance of this we have in the charter to the '&s;ociety for propaga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the go&s;pel in foreign parts." And it is the invariable practice of the legi&s;lature, in every act of parliament, both before and after this act, de&s;igned to affect us, to u&s;e the words colo|nies, or plantations. Nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, in &s;o im|portant
<PB N="244" REF="024800_0239_0FCD6445827F5010">a matter, words of &s;o direct and broad an intent, would have been omitted. "The i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey were properly territories belonging to the king|dom of England, before the union took place: and they &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to the kingdom of Great Britain &s;ince. The church of England was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e i&s;lands, and the legi&s;lature intended to perpetuate it in them, as well as in England it&s;elf; &s;o that as the&s;e i&s;lands were not particularly named in the act, there was occa&s;ion to u&s;e the word territories even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they did not de&s;ign to make the e&s;tabli&s;hment more exten|&s;ive than it was before this law pa&s;&s;ed." Further, in order to include the plantations in the word territories, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it always to mean every other part of the do|minions not particularly mentioned in the in&s;trument that u&s;es it, which is a con&s;truction that can never be admitted: for, hence it will follow, that tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, which give the government of a colony, and the territories there|on depending in America (and this is the ca&s;e of every one of them) extend to all the American colonies, and their governors mu&s;t of con&s;equence have reciprocal &s;uperinten|dencies; and &s;hould any commi&s;&s;ion include the word ter|ritories generally, unre&s;tricted to America, by the &s;ame con|&s;truction, the governor therein mentioned, might exerci&s;e an authority under it, not only in America, but in Africa and the Indies, and even in the kingdom of Ireland, and perhaps, in the ab&s;ence of the king, in Great-Britain it&s;elf. Mr. Hobart goes on, and argues again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment, from the light in which the act of union has, ever &s;ince it was pa&s;&s;ed, been con&s;idered.</P>
<P>"Dr. Bi&s;&s;e, bi&s;hop of Hereford, (&s;ays he) a member of the &s;ociety, preached the annual &s;ermon, February 21, 1717, ten years after the act of union took place; and he &s;ays, it would have well become the wi&s;dom wherewith that great work (the reformation or e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England) was conducted in this kingdom, that this for|eign enterpri&s;e (the &s;ettlement of plantations in America) al&s;o &s;hould have been carried on by the government in the like regular way. But he owns the government at home did not interpo&s;e in the ca&s;e, or e&s;tabli&s;h any form of religion for us. In truth (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) the whole was left to the wi&s;dom of the fir&s;t proprietors, and to the conduct of every private man. He ob&s;erves, that of late years the civil intere&s;t hath been regarded, and the dependence of the co|lonies, on the imperial crown of the realm, &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d: but then, with regard to the religion of the plantations, his
<PB N="245" REF="024800_0240_0FCD644747E12E70">lord&s;hip acknowledges, that the government it&s;elf here at home, &s;overeign as it is, and inve&s;ted, doubtle&s;s, with &s;uf|ficient authority there, hath not thought fit to interpo&s;e in this matter, otherwi&s;e than in this charitable way: it hath enabled us to a&s;k the benevolence of all good chri&s;tians, to|wards the &s;upport of mi&s;&s;ionaries to be &s;ent among them. Thus bi&s;hop Bi&s;&s;e thought as I do, and that the act of union, nor any other law prior thereto, did extend the e&s;tabli&s;hment to the plantations: and if the &s;ociety had not been of the &s;ame opinion, they would hardly have printed and di&s;per&s;|ed his &s;ermon. Neither did the civil rulers of the nation, who may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed acquainted with its laws, think the act of union, or any other law, e&s;tabli&s;hed the church of England in America. This is plain from the let|ter of the lords ju&s;tices to governor Dummer, in the year 1725, almo&s;t twenty years after the union, wherein they &s;ay, there is no regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of any national or provincial church in the&s;e plantations.</P>
<P>"If it be urged, that the king's commi&s;&s;ion to the late bi&s;hop of London, proves an eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment here, it is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that his lord&s;hip was remark|able for &s;kill in the laws, &s;o far as they relate to eccle&s;i|a&s;tical affairs, as appears from his codex; and he was of the contrary opinion; for in his letter to dr. Colman, of May 24, 1735, he writes thus: my opinion has always been, that the religious &s;tate of New England is founded in an equal liberty to all prote&s;tants; none of which can claim the name of a national e&s;tabli&s;hment, or any kind of &s;upe|riority over the re&s;t. This opinion the bi&s;hop gave not only &s;ince the act of union, but even &s;even years after he had re|ceived his commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;urely it mu&s;t be admitted, that as he had time enough to con&s;ider it, &s;o he, of all others, be&s;t under&s;tood it." Thus far mr. Hobart. With re&s;pect to the act of union, I beg leave only to &s;ubjoin, that it is highly probable, the Scotch parliament believed the Engli&s;h intended to e&s;tabli&s;h their church only in England. For in the clo&s;e of the act, by which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed the pre&s;|byterian church in Scotland, it is declared, in the&s;e expre&s;s words, "That the parliament of England may provide for the &s;ecurity of the church of England, as they think ex|pedient, to take place within the bounds of the &s;aid king|dom of England." And whatever latitude the word king|dom has in common &s;peech, it, in a legal &s;en&s;e, is limited to England, properly &s;o called, and excludes the planta|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="024800_0241_0FCD6448CE5CE140">
Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e, that the church of England is e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the&s;e colonies, by any acts prior to the act of union above con&s;idered. For, be&s;ides the &s;everal opinions, again&s;t &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition, already adduced, it is unrea&s;ona|ble to imagine, that if there was any &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, king Charles II. in direct repugnancy thereto, &s;hould have made the grant of Penn&s;ylvania, and given equal privileges to all religions in that province, without even excepting the Roman catholics; and that the colonies of Rhode I&s;land, Connecticut, and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, &s;hould be permit|ted to make their provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments, in oppo&s;ition to an antecedent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England, e&s;|pecially as the laws of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay province, are con&s;tantly &s;ent home, and the king has the ab&s;olute power of repealing every act he &s;hould think improper to be con|tinued as a law. Whoever, therefore, con&s;iders this, and that the king is &s;worn to pre&s;erve the church of England e&s;tab|li&s;hment, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude, that whatever &s;enti|ments may obtain among the epi&s;copalians in America, our kings and their councils have always conceived that &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment could by no means be extended to us. As to Connecticut, all the epi&s;copalians of that colony, and even their mini&s;ters, were legally compellable to contribute to an annual tax for the &s;upport of the congregational clergy, till of late they were favoured with a law which grants them a privilege of exemption from that iniquitous and unrea&s;onable burden.

The epi&s;copal mi&s;|&s;ionaries, for enlarging the &s;phere of their &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s, not many years ago, attempted, by a petition to the late governor Clinton, to engro&s;s the privilege of &s;olemnizing all marriages. A great clamoar en&s;ued, and the attempt was abortive. Before that time, the ceremony was even per|formed by ju&s;tices of the peace, and the judges at law have determined &s;uch marriages to be legal. The governor's li|cences now run to all "prote&s;tant mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel." Whether the ju&s;tices act &s;till, when the bans are publi&s;hed in our churches, which is cu&s;tomary only with the poor, I have not been informed. Marriage in a new country ought to have the highe&s;t encouragements; and it is on this ac|count, perhaps, that we have no provincial law again&s;t &s;uch as are clande&s;tine, though they often happen, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, are attended with con&s;equences equally melancholy and mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>As to the number of our clergymen, it is large enough at pre&s;ent, there being but few &s;ettlements un&s;upplied with a mini&s;try, and &s;ome &s;uperabound. In matters of religion, we are not &s;o intelligent in general, as the inhabitants of the New England colonies; but both in this re&s;pect and good morals, we certainly have the advantage of the &s;outhern provinces. One of the king's in&s;tructions to our governors, recommends the inve&s;tigation of means for the conver&s;ion of negroes and Indians. An attention to both, e&s;pecially the latter, has been too little regarded. If the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Engli&s;h &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, in&s;tead of being &s;eated in opulent chri&s;tianized towns, had been &s;ent out to preach among the &s;avages, un&s;peakable political ad|vantages would have flowed from &s;uch a &s;alutary mea&s;ure. Dr. Dougla&s;s, a &s;en&s;ible, immethodical writer, often incor|rect, expects too much<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Our young mi&s;&s;ionaries may procure a perpetual al|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ance and commercial advantages with the Indians, which the Roman catholic clergy cannot do, becau&s;e they are for|bid to marry. I mean our mi&s;&s;ionaries may intermarry with the daughters of the &s;achems and other con&s;iderable Indi|ans, and their progeny will forever be a certain cement between us and the Indians."

<P>The council, when full, con&s;i&s;ts of twelve members, ap|pointed by the king's mandamus and &s;ign manual. All their privileges and powers are contained in the in&s;tructions. They are a privy council to the governor, in acts of civil govern|ment; and take the &s;ame oath admini&s;tered to the king's council in England. The tenure of their places is extreme|ly precarious, and yet their influence upon the public mea|&s;ures very con&s;iderable.

<P>They enjoy a legi&s;lative power, as the lords do in par|liament; and exerci&s;e al&s;o judicial authority upon writs of error and appeals. They are convened by the governor; and he is always pre&s;ent when they &s;it as a court or privy council, which is ordinarily at the fort. In their legi&s;lative capacity, they meet without the governor, and always at the city hall. They &s;it according to their &s;eniority, and the elde&s;t member pre&s;ent is &s;peaker of their hou&s;e. In a com|mittee, the chairman has no voice. They cannot vote by proxy, but have the privilege of entering their di&s;&s;ent, and the rea&s;ons at large, on their minutes. Their proceedings are very formal, and in many re&s;pects they imitate the example of the lords. Their me&s;&s;ages to the a&s;&s;embly are carried by one of their own members, and the hou&s;e always ri&s;es at his entrance and receives them &s;tanding. The coun|cil never publi&s;h their legi&s;lative minutes; but the a&s;&s;embly always print their own votes; nor do either of the&s;e hou&s;es permit &s;trangers to be pre&s;ent at their conventions,</P>

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s in council daily increa&s;es, and is now become very burden&s;ome, being entirely tran&s;acted by a few mem|bers. Mr. Colden re&s;ides in the country; mr. Clarke in England; mr.

<P>The general a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;even repre&s;en|tatives, cho&s;en by the people, in pur&s;uance of a writ of &s;ummons i&s;&s;ued by the governor.</P>
<P>At the day appointed for their appearance, &s;uch as are elected, convene them&s;elves at the a&s;&s;embly-chamber, in the city of New-York; and, by the clerk of the hou&s;e, in|form the governor of their meeting. If they are above thir|teen in number, &s;ome per&s;ons (generally the judges of the &s;upreme court) are &s;ent to the a&s;&s;embly chamber, empower|ed by a commi&s;&s;ion to take their oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions. They are then called before his excellency, who recom|mends their choice of a &s;peaker. For that purpo&s;e they again retire, and conduct the per&s;on they elect into the chair, which is &s;eated at the upper end of a long table. Af|ter that he is pre&s;ented to his excellency in the council chamber; and upon his approbation of their choice, which is of cour&s;e, the &s;peaker addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the governor, and, in behalf of the hou&s;e, prays, "that their words and actions may have a favourable con&s;truction, that the mem|bers may have free acce&s;s to him, and they and their &s;er|vants be privileged with a freedom from arre&s;ts." The go|vernor, after promi&s;ing the&s;e things on his part, reads his
<PB N="259" REF="024800_0254_0FCD64663465C5C8">&s;peech to both hou&s;es; and, at the reque&s;t of the &s;peaker, delivers a copy for the u&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>I need not enlarge upon the cu&s;toms of the general a&s;|&s;embly, for they take the practice of the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons for their model, and vary from them in but very few in&s;tances. Money bills are not returned to them by the council board, as the lords do to the commons; and yet the rea&s;ons for this practice are much &s;tronger here than at home. When the governor pa&s;&s;es the bills &s;ent up to him, both hou&s;es are pre&s;ent in the council chamber. It is then cu&s;tomary for him to a&s;k the advice of his council with re|&s;pect to every bill, and he &s;igns them at the foot after the&s;e words, "I a&s;&s;ent to this bill, enacting the &s;ame, and order it to be enrolled." After that the acts are publi&s;hed in the open-&s;treet near the city hall; his excellency and the two hou&s;es being pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>The continuance of our a&s;&s;emblies was unlimited, till the political &s;truggles, which took ri&s;e in mr. Co&s;by's admini&s;|tration, forced mr. Clarke, who &s;ucceeded him, to pa&s;s the act re&s;tricting them to three years: but this was repealed by the king, and a &s;eptennial law enacted &s;oon after the arrival of governor Clinton, which is &s;till in full force.</P>
<P>No colony, upon the continent, has formerly &s;uffered more than ours, in the opinion of the king's mini&s;ters. This has been owing to the ill impre&s;&s;ions made by our go|vernors, who are &s;carce ever di&s;engaged from di&s;putes with the lower hou&s;e. Our repre&s;entatives, agreeable to the ge|neral &s;en&s;e of their con&s;tituents, are tenacious in their opi|nion, that the inhabitants of this colony are entitled to all the privileges of Engli&s;hmen; that they have a right to participate in the legi&s;lative power; and that the &s;e&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;emblies here, is wi&s;ely &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of a repre&s;enta|tion in parliament, which, all things con&s;idered, would, at this remote di&s;tance, be extremely inconvenient and dangerous. The governors, on the other hand, in general, entertain political &s;entiments of a quite different nature. All the immunities we enjoy, according to them, not only flow from, but ab&s;olutely depend upon, the mere grace and will of the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We are no more than a little corporation.&mdash;I would advi&s;e the&s;e gentlemen (a&s;&s;emblies) for the future, to drop tho&s;e parliamentary airs and &s;tyle about liberty and proper|ty, and keep within their &s;phere, and make the be&s;t u&s;e they can of his maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions and commi&s;&s;ion; be|cau&s;e it would be high trea&s;on to &s;it and act without it.&mdash;This is our charter. If we abu&s;e or make a wicked u&s;e of his maje&s;ty's favours, we are, of them, but tenants at will; we only hold them, during plea&s;ure and good behaviour." The&s;e are the accurate and bright thoughts of the gentle|man who publi&s;hed a pamphlet, entitled "an e&s;&s;ay on the government of the colonies," in 1752. Sir William Jones, attorney general to James II. was of a very different opinion. For he told the king, "that he could no more grant a com|mi&s;&s;ion to levy money on his &s;ubjects in the plantations, without their con&s;ent by an a&s;&s;embly, than they could di&s;|charge them&s;elves from their allegiance." Life of &s;ir William Phips. p. 23.</NOTE>. It is ea&s;y to conceive, that contentions
<PB N="261" REF="024800_0256_0FCD64691D307150">mu&s;t naturally attend &s;uch a contradiction of &s;entiments. Mo&s;t of our di&s;putes however relate to the &s;upport of go|vernment. Before lord Cornbury's embezzlements, the re|venue was e&s;tabli&s;hed for a long period, but afterwards re|duced to a few years. The violent mea&s;ures, in mr. Co&s;by's time, led the a&s;&s;embly to the &s;cheme of an annual provi&s;ion. The&s;e are the words of that much famed addre&s;s of the hou&s;e, to lieutenant governor Clarke, on the 8th of Septem|ber 1737, previous to the change.</P>
<P>"The true cau&s;es of the deficiency of the revenue, we believe, are too well known to your honour, to make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us to &s;ay much on that head. Had the con&s;picuous loyalty of the inhabitants of this province, met with a &s;uita|ble treatment in return, it is not unlikely, but we &s;hould now be weak enough to act like others before us, in being lavi&s;h beyond our abilities, and rai&s;ing &s;ums unnece&s;&s;ary to be given; and continued the donation, like them, for a longer time than what was convenient for the &s;afety of the inhabitants: but experience has &s;hown the imprudence of &s;uch a conduct; and the mi&s;erable condition, to which the province is reduced, renders the rai&s;ing of large &s;ums very difficult, if not impracticable. We therefore beg leave to be plain with your honour, and hope you will not take it ami&s;s, when we tell you, that you are not to expect, that we either will rai&s;e &s;ums unfit to be rai&s;ed; or put what we &s;hall rai&s;e into the power of a governor to mi&s;apply, if we can prevent it: nor &s;hall we make up any other deficiencies, than what we conceive are fit and ju&s;t to be paid; or continue what &s;upport or revenue we &s;hall rai&s;e, for any longer time than one year. Nor do we think it convenient to do even that, until &s;uch laws are pa&s;&s;ed, as we conceive nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the inhabitants of this colony, who have repo&s;ed a tru&s;t in us for that only purpo&s;e; and which we are &s;ure you will think it rea&s;onable we &s;hould act agreeable to; and by the grace of God we will endeavour not to deceive them."</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="024800_0257_0FCD646A9BC05308">
The &s;entiments of this addre&s;s &s;till prevail among the peo|ple; and therefore the &s;ucce&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;olicitations, for a permanent, indefinite &s;upport, will probably be in vain.</P>
<P>The matter has been often litigated with great fervency on both &s;ides, and the example of the Briti&s;h parliament urged as a precedent for our imitation. To this it is an|&s;wered, that the particular &s;tate of this province differs &s;o widely from that of their mother country, that we ought not in this re&s;pect to follow the cu&s;tom of the commons. Our con&s;titution, as &s;ome ob&s;erve, is &s;o imperfect in num|berle&s;s in&s;tances, that the rights of the people lie, even now, at the mere mercy of their governors; and granting a per|petual &s;upport, it is thought, would be in reality little le&s;s, than the lo&s;s of every thing dear to them.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that many plau&s;ible arguments may be a&s;&s;igned, in &s;upport of the jealou&s;y of the hou&s;e. A go|vernor has numberle&s;s opportunities, not proper to be men|tioned, for invading the rights of the people; and in&s;uper|able difficulties would nece&s;&s;arily attend all the means of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>By gradual advances, at &s;ea&s;onable junctures, we might have introduced &s;uch amendments, as would, at this day, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ound and well fortified political frame; but through our utter neglect of education, the ancient a&s;|&s;emblies con&s;i&s;ted of plain, illiterate hu&s;bandmen, who&s;e views &s;eldom extended farther than to the regulation of highways, the de&s;truction of wolves, wild cats, and foxes, and the advancement of the other little intere&s;ts of the par|ticular counties, which they were cho&s;en to repre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of our laws and courts.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of our laws opens a door to much controver|&s;y. The uncertainty, with re&s;pect to them, renders property precarious, and greatly expo&s;es us to the arbitrary deci&s;ions of bad judges. The common law of England is generally received, together with &s;uch &s;tatutes, as were enacted before we had a legi&s;lature of our own. But our courts exerci&s;e a &s;overeign authority, in determining what
<PB N="263" REF="024800_0258_0FCD646C1AEB24D0">parts of the common and &s;tatute law ought to be extended; for it mu&s;t be admitted, that the difference of circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;arily requires us, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to reject the determi|nations of both. In many in&s;tances, they have al&s;o extend|ed, as I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, even acts of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince we have had a di&s;tinct legi&s;lation, which is ad|ding greatly to our confu&s;ion. The practice of our courts is not le&s;s uncertain than the law. Some of the Engli&s;h rules are adopted and others rejected. Two things, therefore, &s;eem to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The pa&s;&s;ing an act for &s;ettling the extent of the Engli&s;h laws. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, That the courts ordain a general &s;et of rules for the regulation of the practice.</P>
<P>To give a particular account of our laws, civil and crimi|nal, cannot be expected in this work. All lands are held of the crown by &s;ocage tenure, as tho&s;e of Ea&s;t-Greenwich, at home, in the county of Kent; and the manner of obtain|ing a title to &s;uch as are vacant, or in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Indians, is this:</P>
<P>Formerly the cu&s;tom was to apply to the governor in council, for a licen&s;e to purcha&s;e lands of the natives in his maje&s;ty's name. A deed was then privately obtained from the Indian proprietors to the king, and annexed to a &s;econd petition to the governor, for a warrant to the &s;urveyor-ge|neral, to make a &s;urvey of the quantity purcha&s;ed. Another warrant, upon the return of the &s;urvey, was then i&s;&s;ued to the attorney-general, to prepare a draught of the patent; which being tran&s;mitted to the &s;ecretary's office, was then engro&s;&s;ed upon parchment, and the great &s;eal affixed to it by the governor.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;urveys and deeds, more lands were often inclu|ded, than the Indians intended to &s;ell; and the&s;e frauds being frequently complained of, an order was made by the governor and council in 1736, that thenceforth no Indian deed &s;hould be taken, until the land propo&s;ed to be grant|ed, was actually &s;urveyed by the &s;urveyor-general, or one of his deputies, in the pre&s;ence of the Indian proprietors; that the bounds of the tract &s;hould be then entered in the deed, and a certificate endor&s;ed, that they are agreeable to the &s;urvey, and that he &s;aw the con&s;ideration money or goods, <HI>bon&acirc; fide,</HI> delivered to the vendors.</P>
<P>The patenting of lands, has long been, and &s;till continues to be, very expen&s;ive.</P>

I have no intere&s;t in the points in que&s;tion, but what are common to all the freemen of this province. I profe&s;s the greate&s;t veneration for the laws of my country, and am glad of every opportunity to do them public honour. They place our liberties upon the firme&s;t ba&s;is, and put our properties under the &s;ure&s;t protection. I rejoice in the &s;ecurity that we have of a long enjoyment of them, by the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover. 'Tis the excel|lency of our con&s;titution, and the glory of our princes, that they are &s;overeign over freemen and not &s;laves. 'Tis the mi&s;ery of an arbitrary government, that a man can enjoy nothing under it that he can call his own. Life, liberty, and property, are not his, but all at the will and di&s;po&s;al of his tyrannical owner. I don't wonder that our ance&s;tors have been always &s;o jealous of their liberties: how oft have they bravely fought, and nobly died, in the defence of them? We have received our liberties and our laws, as an inheri|tance tran&s;mitted to us in the blood of our fathers. How highly, therefore, &s;hould we prize and value them! And what care &s;hould we take, that we and our po&s;terity may en|joy them in their full extent?

<P>Mr. Murray laboured to &s;how, that the chancery, king's bench, common pleas and exchequer, were of original juri&s;|diction, by the con&s;titution of England; and was fearful that our e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e courts here, by an act of a&s;|&s;embly, would draw into que&s;tion our equal rights to all the liberties and privileges of Engli&s;hmen. He clo&s;ed his opinion in this manner:</P>
<P>"And now, mr. &s;peaker, I have in the be&s;t manner that I was capable of, performed what this honourable hou&s;e de&s;ired of me, in giving truly my &s;entiments upon the &s;ub|ject matter of the&s;e petitions.</P>
<P>"Mr. Smith, in delivering his &s;entiments la&s;t Friday, did in &s;o hand&s;ome and elegant a manner, fully prove that the people of this colony are undoubtedly entitled to the cu&s;toms, laws, liberties, and privileges of Engli&s;hment, that it was needle&s;s for me to attempt the proof thereof, which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done. But I do entirely agree with him, in all that he &s;aid on that head; and I hope I have proved, that the fundamental courts, by the laws of England, are as much part of tho&s;e liberties and privileges, and as much by the cu&s;toms and laws of England, as any other of their liberties and privileges are; and of con&s;e|quence, the people here as much entitled to tho&s;e funda|mental courts, as to their other privileges; and have en|deavoured to an&s;wer all the objections that I had heard were, or thought could be, made again&s;t our being entitled to the &s;ame courts. And upon the whole thereof, as there has been much talked about the liberties and privileges of the people, I would beg leave only to propound this one que&s;tion, who is he that argues mo&s;t in favour of the liber|ties of the people? He who affirms and proves, that they are entitled to tho&s;e liberties and privileges, laws and cu&s;|toms of England, and the good old original courts, that are by tho&s;e laws, without an act? or, he who argues and &s;ays, we are not entitled to them, until an act is pa&s;&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h them? I &s;uppo&s;e the an&s;wer would be given, with|out he&s;itation, in favour of the former.</P>
<P>"But, mr. &s;peaker, if it yet &s;hould be &s;aid, that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for making acts, relating to tho&s;e courts, I would beg leave to offer to this honourable hou&s;e, the imitation of &s;uch laws relating to tho&s;e courts, as the wi&s;e legi&s;lature of England have thought &s;it to make.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By your reque&s;t, I have peru&s;ed and con&s;idered the arguments of mr. Smith and mr. Murray, before the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of New-York, in relation to the court of equity e&s;tabli&s;hed there in a new court of exchequer; which, I perceive, was done, principally, for determining a di&s;|pute between the governor and the pre&s;ident of the council, about their right to the &s;alary annexed to the office of the commander in chief, whether he be the governor or pre&s;i|dent; and it &s;eems &s;trange to me, that upon &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, &s;o extraordinary a &s;tep &s;hould be taken, as the erect|ing of a new court, exempted from the rules of the pro|ceeding at the common law, when the matter might have been decided in an action of the ca&s;e upon an <HI>indebitatus a&s;&s;ump&s;it,</HI> which is the &s;ettled method and mo&s;t expeditious remedy, in ca&s;es of that nature.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to have agreed in one point, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to trace the court of chancery and the equity court in the exchequer back to their original in&s;ti|tution, in order to &s;how whether the governor of a new plantation, hath a power or not, to erect courts, in imita|tion of the&s;e high and ancient courts in England.&mdash;And from their re&s;earches, they &s;eem to have made very different conclu&s;ions. Mr. Smith rightly concludes again&s;t the lega|lity of this court; but mr. Murray is afraid all mu&s;t be lo&s;t, if the four fundamental courts, as he calls them, cannot be obtained in New York.&mdash;I own I do not under&s;tand the force of this &s;ort of rea&s;oning; nor can I conceive, how any enquiry into the original of the high court of chancery, which mu&s;h, after all, end in a mere conjecture, can afford the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in forming a right judgment upon this que&s;tion, which mu&s;t depend upon the particular con&s;titu|tion of the&s;e foreign colonies.&mdash;</P>
<P>The court of chancery, in England, has its being from cu&s;tom and u&s;age, to which it owes its legality.&mdash;If it were to be erected now by the king's power, it could not &s;tand; therefore it is undoubtedly a great ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, that upon the planting every new colony by the &s;ubjects of Eng|land, new courts mu&s;t &s;pring up, as it were from the roots of the ancient courts, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature; becau&s;e we can imitate their methods of proceeding, though we are very imperfect in compari&s;on to their rea&s;on and Judgment.&mdash;Then I think there is another impropriety in the debate of this que&s;tion: they would ar|gue from the power and prerogative of the king, to entitle a governor to act in the &s;ame manner. I think, before they turn a governor into a king, they &s;hould take care, to pro|vide for him the &s;ame &s;ufficiency of wi&s;dom and as able a council: therefore I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, a mighty difference be|tween the power of a king and the governors abroad.&mdash;Their in&s;tructions, as to the erecting of courts, or the au|thorities granted in their patents for that purpo&s;e, are not now, as they were in the beginning, when there were no courts: but proper judicatures being long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed, there is an end of their power in that re&s;pect; and if any alteration is found nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t certainly be done by the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature. The kings of England have always, &s;o far as I am acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the plantations, u&s;ed a particular tenderne&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s of erecting their courts of judicature, by directing their go|vernors, to take the advice of the general a&s;&s;emblies in that matter, and I dare &s;ay, that if the patents and in&s;tructions of the governor of New-York were to be in&s;pected, no &s;uffi|cient warrant will be found in them, to exerci&s;e this high power of &s;etting up new courts. But be that as it will, this is mo&s;t manife&s;t, that &s;etting up one or more men, with power to judge men's properties, by other rules than tho&s;e of the common law, by which alone we of the plantations mu&s;t be governed, mu&s;t &s;ubject the e&s;tates of that people to an arbitrary rule, &s;o far as they are re&s;trained from appeal|ing to an higher juri&s;diction, and may en&s;lave them to the weak, if not corrupt, judgments of tho&s;e men.&mdash;It really &s;eems to be a &s;ingular misfortune to the people of New-York, that a que&s;tion of this nature &s;hould be &s;o far coun|tenanced, as to become a &s;ubject of argument, when, I be|lieve, in any other colony, it would not have been thought a matter of any doubt or the lea&s;t difficulty. But above all, it is mo&s;t extravagant, that a court of equity &s;hould be erected, for the trial of a cau&s;e, of which, without doing violence to its nature, it cannot have any juri&s;diction: and I have wondered, in &s;o warm a debate, that this point has been pa&s;&s;ed over.&mdash;I think nothing could entitle the court of equi|ty, to proceed in the cau&s;e between the governor and Van Dam, unle&s;s there was a want of proof, of Van Dam's re|ceiving the money in di&s;pute, which I &s;uppo&s;e is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince it mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued out of the public trea&s;ury of the province.&mdash;If I had been to have argued this point, I &s;hould have taken a very different method from tho&s;e gentlemen. In&s;tead of taking &s;o much pains, in running through &s;o many book ca&s;es, to &s;ettle what the con&s;titution of England is, I would have &s;tated the con&s;titution of this particular government, as it is grounded either upon treaties or grants from the crown of England; for as New-York was a con|quered country, it is very probable, &s;omething may have been &s;tipulated, between the &s;tates general and crown of England, in behalf of the &s;ubjects of Holland, which were left there in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates, and &s;o became &s;ub|jects to England.&mdash;If there was any &s;uch treaty, that mu&s;t be looked upon as the fundamental law of the province; and next to that, the king's charters mu&s;t take place.&mdash;I do not at all doubt, but &s;ome way or other, the common law was e&s;tabli&s;hed there, and if not, as there is a legi&s;lature, I &s;up|po&s;e it is adopted by the country; for there is undoubtedly, a great difference between the people of a conquered coun|try, and colonies e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king's con&s;ent by the &s;ubjects of England. The common law follows them where|ever they go; but as to the other, it mu&s;t ari&s;e either from treaties or grants; therefore it is a pity, every thing in re|lation to this matter has been omitted, which would have been of great u&s;e to tho&s;e, who are unacquainted with the facts, in forming a judgment in this ca&s;e.&mdash;I cannot forbear ob&s;erving a mighty weakne&s;s in the lawyers of New-York, in blindly following a common error, in relation to the &s;tatutes of England being in force there; whereas there is no foundation in &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on for &s;uch an opinion. The common law mu&s;t be the only rule; and if we wade into the &s;tatutes, no man can tell what the law is. It is certain, all of them cannot bind, and to know which do, was al|ways above my capacity.&mdash;Tho&s;e, that are declarative of the common law, &s;erve us rather as evidences, than by any binding quality, as &s;tatutes.</P>

<HEAD>THE COURT OF CHANCERY.</HEAD>
<P>OF all our courts, none has been more obnoxious to the people than this. There have been (as I have already &s;hown) few admini&s;trations &s;ince its fir&s;t erection, in which our a&s;&s;emblies have not expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation of its con&s;titution by ordinance, and the exerci&s;e of the chan|cellor's power by the governor. During the admini&s;tration of governor Co&s;by, a bill was filed by &s;ir Jo&s;eph Eyles and others, to vacate the oblong patent granted by his imme|diate predece&s;&s;or to Hauley and company. The defendants excepted to the governor's juri&s;diction; but being over|ruled, they re&s;orted to the a&s;&s;embly with a complaint, and the hou&s;e, on the 6th of November 1735, re&s;olved,</P>
<P>"That a court of chancery in this province, in the hands or under the exerci&s;e of a governor, without con&s;ent in general a&s;&s;embly, is contrary to law, unwarrantable, and of dangerous con&s;equence to the liberties and properties of the people."</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;entiments obtained among the people in mr. Clarke's time, as is very evident in the memorable addre&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly, in 1737, a part of which, relative to the court of chancery, is too &s;ingular to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"The &s;ettling and e&s;tabli&s;hing of courts of general juri&s;|diction, for the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, is nece&s;&s;ary in every country: and we conceive they ought to be &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the acts of the whole legi&s;lature, and their &s;everal juri&s;dictions and powers by that authority limited and appointed, e&s;pecially courts that are to take cognizance of matters in a cour&s;e of equity.&mdash;This has been the con&s;tant practice in England, when new courts were to be erected, or old ones to be aboli&s;hed or altered: and the &s;everal kings of England, in who&s;e reigns tho&s;e acts were made, never conceived, that the &s;ettling, erecting, or abo|li&s;hing courts, by acts of the legi&s;lature, had any tendency to de&s;troy or in the lea&s;t to dimini&s;h their ju&s;t and legal pre|rogatives.
<PB N="275" REF="024800_0270_0FCD64878BEDECB0">&mdash;It was the method in u&s;e here, both before and &s;ince the revolution, and particularly recommended to the a&s;&s;embly to be done in that manner, by a me&s;&s;age from go|vernor Sloughter and council, on the 15th day of April 1691. He was the fir&s;t governor &s;ince the revolution; and the governors that &s;ince that time a&s;&s;ented to tho&s;e acts, we &s;uppo&s;e, never in the lea&s;t imagined, they were giving up the prerogative of their ma&s;ters, when they gave that a&s;&s;ent; nor did we ever learn, that they were cen&s;ured for doing &s;o.&mdash;On the contrary, the con&s;tant in&s;tructions, that have from time to time been given to the governors of this pro|vince, &s;eem clearly to point out the doing of it, by acts of the legi&s;lature, and not otherwi&s;e, as may be gathered from the in&s;truction, for the erecting of a court for the determin|ing of &s;mall cau&s;es, by which there are po&s;itive directions given to the governors, to recommend it to the a&s;&s;embly, that a law &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; but notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e directions, given in direct and expre&s;s terms, the governors never would apply for &s;uch an act, but erected that court by an ordinance of them&s;elves and council, as they did the court of chancery, which had before that time been erected by acts of the legi&s;lature in another manner.&mdash;They could not be ignorant, what di&s;&s;atisfaction the erecting of a court of chancery in that manner, gave the generality of the people.&mdash;This was very manife&s;t, by the re&s;olves of the general a&s;&s;embly, at the time of its fir&s;t being &s;o erected, and often &s;ince, declaring the illegality of &s;uch a proceed|ing. And though the&s;e re&s;olves have been as often as made, treated by the governors with an unrea&s;onable di&s;regard and contempt of them, yet to men of prudence, they might have been effectual, to have made them decline per&s;i&s;ting in a procedure, &s;o illegal and &s;o generally di&s;&s;atisfactory; and which (as they managed it) proved of no u&s;e to the pub|lic or benefit to them&s;elves. For as few of them had talents equal to the ta&s;k of a chancellor, which they had under|taken to perform, &s;o it was executed accordingly. Some of them being willing to hold &s;uch a court, others not, accord|ing as they happened to be influenced by tho&s;e about them. So that were it really e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mo&s;t legal manner (as it was not) yet being in the hands of a per&s;on not com|pellable to do his duty, it was &s;o managed, that the extra|ordinary delays and fruitle&s;s expen&s;e attending it, ren|dered it not only u&s;ele&s;s, but a grievance to the inhabitants, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, who were &s;o unfortunate as to be concern|ed in it: which we hope you think with us, that it is high time &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="024800_0271_0FCD64888F74AA40">
"Your honour well knows, that the e&s;tabli&s;hing that court, in the manner it has been done, has been a &s;ubject of contention, between the governors and the a&s;&s;embly; and &s;ince it is confe&s;&s;ed by all, that the e&s;tabli&s;hing both of that, and other courts, by act of the legi&s;lature, is indi&s;pu|tably legal, and gives them the mo&s;t uncontrovertible au|thority; and if unque&s;tionably legal, what is &s;o, cannot be de&s;tructive of his maje&s;ty's prerogative.&mdash;We therefore hope, you will make no &s;cruple of a&s;&s;enting to this bill, to put an end to a contention, that has not been, nor will be, while it continues, beneficial to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice."&mdash;</P>
<P>From this time, the chancery has been unattacked by the a&s;&s;embly, but the bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted in it is very incon|&s;iderable. A court of equity is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; but whether private proper|ty ought to be in the hands of the governors, I leave others to determine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some are of opinion, that the governor's juri&s;diction in this, and the &s;piritual, or prerogative court, are incom|patible.</NOTE>. As the public bu&s;ine&s;s of the colony increa|&s;es, few of them, I believe, will be ambitious of the chan|cellor's office, as they have not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a ma&s;ter of the rolls. The pre&s;ent officers of this court (which is al|ways held in the council chamber at the fort) are, his ex|cellency &s;ir Charles Hardy, knt. chancellor, two ma&s;ters, two clerks, one examiner, a regi&s;ter, and a &s;erjeant at arms, and not one of them has a &s;alary. In our proceedings, we copy after the chancery in England; and indeed in all our courts, the practice at home is more nearly imitated in this and New Jer&s;ey, than in any other province upon the con|tinent. Few of our a&s;&s;emblies have been capable to concert any new regulations of this kind: and hence the lawyers have had recour&s;e to the Engli&s;h cu&s;toms and forms, which they have generally adopted. While the New England colo|nies, through the &s;uperior education of their repre&s;entatives, have introduced numberle&s;s innovations, peculiar to them|&s;elves; the laws of our mother country have gradually ob|tained here, and in this re&s;pect, the public has perhaps receiv|ed advantages, even from the ignorance of our ance&s;tors.</P>
