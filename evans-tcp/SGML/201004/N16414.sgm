<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE writing of the following pages was occa&s;ioned by &s;ee|ing a paragraph in a news paper, relative to a woman in the city who had de&s;troyed her&s;elf on account of &s;ome in|felicity in marriage. The author reflecting how many there might probably be, who were completely wretched, and who, notwith&s;tand|ing, did not plunge them&s;elves into another world to avoid the mi&s;e|ries of this, thought it might be a &s;ubject worthy the con&s;ideration of every humane per&s;on; and therefore has, in the &s;ub&s;equent pages, &s;et forth the mi&s;ery of marriage in tho&s;e who are un&s;uitably united together, and endeavoured to &s;how the cau&s;es of &s;uch infelicity, and the lawfulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of divorce, in other ca&s;es be&s;ide tho&s;e at pre&s;ent admitted. And although no e&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject has yet ap|peared in this country, that he has &s;een, yet this does not prove it unnece&s;&s;ary; and, what&s;oever may be the merits of the work, if it opens a way for abler di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, the writer will not think his labour entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL that he can &s;ay of his performance, is, that he was in|duced to undertake it from a &s;trong &s;ympathetic feeling for the weak|ne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human nature; and has endeavoured to execute it in a manner mo&s;t likely to communicate the &s;ame to his Readers. He has chiefly aimed at brevity and per&s;picuity, and if he has ad|vanced any thing new, it is in the way of opinion only, and there|fore reque&s;ts the attention of his Readers to the matter, and not to the manner, of his remarks. But if any &s;hould think any thing in the former worthy of making objections to, the writer has more to &s;ay, but in regard to the latter, he only reque&s;ts of the Public a fa|vourable reception.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>_AMERICA has been famous for her love of liber|ty, and hatred of tyranny of every kind; &s;he has not only by arms expelled her foreign foes, but generou&s;ly extended her liberality, in a great mea|&s;ure, even unto the African &s;laves. Therefore, it is hoped, the &s;ame &s;pirit of indulgence will extend &s;till further&mdash;to tho&s;e unhappy individuals, mixed among every cla&s;s of mankind, who are frequently united together in the wor&s;t of bondage to each other; occa&s;ioned by circum&s;tances not in their pow|er to fore&s;ee, or prevent, at the time of their union; which &s;hould entitle them to relief from humane legi&s;lators and the re&s;t of mankind. We believe it will be readily admitted, that there is no circum&s;tance in life, on which our happine&s;s &s;o much depends, as being &s;uitably united together in marri|age; and that no fore&s;ight that people are capable of, at that time, is &s;ufficient to fore&s;ee, or prevent, the many cau&s;es that are likely to de&s;troy the felicity of that union; and that it is equally certain, that various cau&s;es do de&s;troy it, and
<PB N="4" REF="021076_0004_0FB22FA987471150">render them completely mi&s;erable; from hence ari&s;es the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of divorce in &s;uch &s;ituations, under &s;uch re&s;trictions as may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The large portion of moral e&s;&s;ays generally taken up in lectures on the &s;ubject of marriage, &s;hows of what con&s;equence that &s;ingle, important action of our lives is e&s;teemed to be to mankind; which could not be of &s;o much importance if we were allowed to rectify pa&s;t errors by future experience. But the whole of our in&s;truction, on that head, generally amounts to little more than if &s;uch in&s;truction as this &s;hould be given to a traveller in a &s;trange country: that in the mid&s;t of the highway, that he mu&s;t unavoidably pa&s;s, there is a deep and dreadful pit, curiou&s;ly covered from view, into which, if he falls, he can never extricate him&s;elf therefrom, but mu&s;t in|evitably die a mi&s;erable death. And truly &s;uch is the mar|riage lot at pre&s;ent to many, and to more than can ea&s;ily be conceived, becau&s;e the greate&s;t &s;ufferers thereby, for the mo&s;t part, conceal their &s;ituation, to keep them&s;elves from being de&s;pi&s;ed by the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;hall recite, in the fir&s;t place, the probable cau&s;es of &s;uch infelicity; in the next place, the mi&s;erable pro&s;pect of an unhappy couple, and the evil they are the occa&s;ion of, not only to them&s;elves but others; and la&s;tly, of the lawfulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of divorce. The ca&s;es we &s;hall briefly &s;tate, by way of example, will be taken from the middling cla&s;s of man|kind, as the neare&s;t repre&s;entation of the others. And we &s;hall only mention the leading and principal di&s;po&s;itions, and leave the judicious reader, from ob&s;ervations and reflections in his own mind, to pur&s;ue the de&s;cription more minutely.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the un&s;uitablene&s;s ari&s;ing from circum|&s;tances: as when a gentleman from the country, or farmer's &s;on, marries a young woman educated in the city, perhaps of &s;maller fortune, but of genteel family, he takes her home; after the fir&s;t formality of vi&s;iting being over, the appear|ances of every thing around di&s;plea&s;es her; &s;he cannot help, after a while, making remarks; &s;ometimes, perhaps, &s;uch as the&s;e: of his want of nearne&s;s in his dre&s;s, of the furniture of his hou&s;e, of the requi&s;ites that are wanting on his table, of the indecency of his &s;ervants and dome&s;ties, of the ru&s;ticity of his neighbours and acquaintance. He thinks him&s;elf ju&s;|tified in retaliating, in &s;ome degree, in remarks on the need|le&s;s formality, appearances, dre&s;s and addre&s;s, of the citi|zens; for the pre&s;ent it pa&s;&s;es off, but the &s;cene is again of|ten renewed with more di&s;like than before on each part: from remarks they go to di&s;pute, after a while to je&s;t, ridi|cule and contempt, and the&s;e, by imperceptible degrees, from
<PB N="5" REF="021076_0005_0FB22FAB06C2A6E0">time to time, as occa&s;ion occurs. The &s;ervants, neighbours and relatives of the hu&s;band, mock and &s;neer at all the wife &s;ays or does; &s;he has the dairy, poultry and hou&s;ewi&s;ery to manage and conduct in a manner &s;he never &s;aw in her life, and is un|able to perform; her hu&s;band complaining of her doing needle&s;s things and leaving the nece&s;&s;ary undone, which equally di&s;plea&s;es him. They di&s;agree in their humours about dre&s;s, table, recreations, &s;ervants and every thing. From the repetition of di&s;putes (which are the effect of their different feelings only) pa&s;&s;ions are exited in each, which were before unknown to either. They then mutually torment, thwart, plague, revile, and hate one another; and this, per|haps, takes place in no long time after marriage. I need not add more. It is ea&s;y to conceive a great many different de|grees of un&s;uitablene&s;s, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame cau&s;e, that is, in the manner of their education, that &s;ooner or later has the &s;ame effect. But if they are well-bred people they conceal their &s;ituation from the world as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If a gentleman of good rank and education marries a wo|man of mean birth, but &s;uperior fortune, the ca&s;e is no better: &s;he de&s;pi&s;es him for his notions of dignity and elegance that &s;he cannot comprehend; and he reproaches her for her mean, low conceptions and appearances, in every thing; &s;he cen|&s;ures him for his want of wealth, and he retorts upon her for the want of every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, tho&s;e who marry of different profe&s;&s;ions in reli|gion, although they may not be &s;o zealous them&s;elves as to differ about it much at fir&s;t; yet, when the warmth of their pa&s;&s;ion has abated, they will each of them feel their former prejudices, and their re&s;pective relatives, on each &s;ide, in all their &s;eparate conver&s;ations with them, will imperceptibly, without de&s;ign, in&s;pire each of them by degrees, with di&s;|approbation, di&s;like, and contempt of the manners, cu&s;toms, appearances and principles of each other; and each of them will be more and more inclined to vindicate their own. All the errors, faults, and misfortunes will be magnified and mi&s;repre&s;ented, and charged upon each other by the friends of each party; which will, by degrees, create reflections; &s;our|ne&s;s, di&s;like and contempt will encrea&s;e, e&s;pecially if there is any har&s;hne&s;s of temper in either party, and fal&s;hood, for the mo&s;t part, will not be wanting on one &s;ide or other to keep up a ferment, until a &s;teady hatred en&s;ues.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;teady hatred will always begin, as &s;oon as the pain they re|ceive from each other is greater than the plea&s;ure.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, if a young couple marry without con&s;ent of pa|rents on each &s;ide, the con&s;equence is nearly the &s;ame as the
<PB N="6" REF="021076_0006_0FB22FAD2EA6A080">la&s;t; the animo&s;ity of the friends of each party is greater; they refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t their children in a &s;ettlement in the world, but reflect on each other, and foment unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;ourne&s;s in their children, which encrea&s;es with their &s;trait circum|&s;tances in the world; each of them become weary of their &s;itu|ation; their company grows painful with each other, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as in the la&s;t ca&s;e; they conceive an aver&s;ion to each other they know not why, and their tempers are &s;oured towards others they know not for what; this creates enemies; poverty, contempt and aver&s;ion follows.</P>
<P>Thus it is with the pa&s;&s;ions of the human &s;oul, as with the &s;trings of a mu&s;ical in&s;trument: one being di&s;ordered, &s;poils the mu&s;ick of the whole, and produces nothing but di&s;har|mony.</P>
<P>Fourthly, when a couple, with mutual a&s;&s;ection, and na|turally good di&s;po&s;itions, agree to unite in marriage; but, through warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, or affection, that would not perhaps wait until a &s;ettlement, or means of a living, could be provided; they mi&s;conduct, or make what is called a mi&s;|&s;tep: they are then without remedy not only di&s;owned, but expo&s;ed to the world; and now they are not only looked upon as children of &s;in and di&s;obedience, but as malcontents and enemies to the &s;ociety in which they were educated. In this &s;ituation, deprived of the confidence of their fellow ci|tizens, they are left to provide for them&s;elves;&mdash;their pa|rents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though as children have nothing but what they receive by nature and education from their parents, tutors and companions, the infamy re&s;ts ultimately on their parents and tho&s;e who have the care of their education, (e&s;pecially when they live among tho&s;e of their own pro|fe&s;&s;ion) and not on them&s;elves, who are ignorant of their own weak|ne&s;s and of the evil con&s;equences that will attend, until it is too late to prevent them. The Chine&s;e laws make communities an&s;werable for offences committed within their re&s;pective authorities; parents for the mi&s;behaviour of their children; concluding that they mu&s;t have neg|lected their education, and magi&s;trates are &s;everely puni&s;hed for tho&s;e crimes committed within the di&s;tricts of their authority. Modern Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, vol. viii. p. 153, 172. Antient Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, vol. viii. p. 266.</NOTE> choo&s;e rather to give or tru&s;t their property in the hands of children who have conducted better; a coldne&s;s and &s;hyne&s;s takes place among all their acquaintance; they &s;eem as if they belonged to nobody, and nobody to them; they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate with inferiors, or none at all. Vi&s;its are made into the neighbourhood, and enquiries into every part of their conduct, and how they behave, and if they are like to make out in the world. And tho&s;e vi&s;itors being fully prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the above opinion, they operate as &s;ieves,
<PB N="7" REF="021076_0007_0FB22FAE07AE7DE0">or &s;kimmers; they take away all the dro&s;s, and leave the good behind; their characters are too re&s;pectable to be que&s;|tioned; they &s;ow their tares as they go, the opinion of the world is &s;oon formed in regard to their worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and they are accordingly treated with contempt.</P>
<P>The unthinking couple cannot help murmuring at tho&s;e from whom they receive unmerited affronts; this never fails of creating a number of real enemies, who con&s;tantly mag|nify their faults, and mi&s;repre&s;ent all they &s;ay or do; they find them&s;elves not only de&s;erted by their acquaintance, but their neare&s;t and deare&s;t friends are ho&s;tily armed to do them every injury.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, uncon&s;cious of any fault, they reflect on each other as the cau&s;e of their misfortune, by &s;ome indi&s;cre|tion or other. They tire each other with complaints they cannot relieve, and in this &s;tate of &s;ourne&s;s and di&s;content, every tale of calumny and fal&s;hood, makes deep impre&s;&s;ion on them; and lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and inactivity of body en&s;ues, when the contrary is mo&s;t requi&s;ite for their &s;upport; then poverty and ill-humour, and all the train of evils and calamities that can befal human creatures in di&s;tre&s;s, attend them to the end of their days.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 12, 13, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> For the honour of human nature we could wi&s;h the above repre&s;entation was entirely groundle&s;s; yet we believe this will not be found an ima|ginary de&s;cription by tho&s;e who will be at the pains to exa|mine what becomes of many of tho&s;e who are thus di&s;owned.</P>
<P>And here we cannot help making a reflection, though not immediately relating to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>O ye pa&s;tors of flocks and heads of &s;ocieties, what &s;entence do you expect to receive at the la&s;t day, for making the&s;e numerous &s;acrifices of your mo&s;t innocent lambs? The powers of nature are &s;trong in the mo&s;t perfect parts of the creation; youth may plead ignorance of the con&s;equence, but age cannot; you know well, by experience, what you are about and what will be the con&s;equence of your doings; nei|ther does it deter from the&s;e offences, becau&s;e they know not their puni&s;hment until it arrives, nor even then from whence it &s;prings. Their crime certainly hurts not you; but it is not the ruin and de&s;truction of their peri&s;hable beings and livings here alone you &s;eek or effect; but perhaps of their precious, immortal &s;ouls for ever hereafter, at lea&s;t as far as you are capable of effecting it.</P>
<P>How differently did the Saviour and Judge of mankind &s;entence the woman taken in adultery: "Neither do I con|demn
<PB N="8" REF="021076_0008_0FB22FAF863F4228">thee, go and &s;in no more," was all his reproof to her, when &s;he told him no man had condemned her. Not &s;o his &s;entence when he pronounced condemnation, and &s;o many woes, on the teachers of that day, that bound grievous bur|dens on other men's &s;houlders that them&s;elves would not move with one of their fingers; think to your&s;elves if this be not a parallel ca&s;e, and how you will an&s;wer for it; think where the rich man lifted up his eyes in torment, and how you will abide a like &s;ituation, if the &s;cene &s;hould be changed for you. But if you are more innocent than the&s;e victims, heaven will regard you, and this reflection will not hurt you.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion: the ob&s;ervations we &s;hall make next, are, upon un&s;uitablene&s;s of temper. If a man of a &s;ubtil, proud, unforgiving temper, marries a woman of a pa&s;&s;ionate, provoking, unre&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition, he acci|dently affronts her; &s;he immediately, in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, affronts him in return; he conceals his re&s;entment, but will frequently afterwards &s;ting her with his witty &s;neers, in a manner &s;he cannot guard again&s;t nor ea&s;ily bear; her anger is over; &s;he bears it for a while; but at la&s;t &s;he affronts him &s;till wor&s;e where he can lea&s;t bear it: he now never omits any opportunity of exerci&s;ing his malicious wit upon her; they &s;oon grow intolerably weary and hateful to each other.</P>
<P>There are many other bad tempers and di&s;po&s;itions that would tend to make any unhappy if indulged to extreme: &s;uch as ince&s;&s;ant &s;colding, abu&s;ive and indecent language, cru|elty to children, exce&s;&s;ive fretfulne&s;s and impatience about things unavoidable; many of the&s;e qualities would become mo|derated on a change of companions, &s;o as to become agreea|ble accompli&s;hments: as when a compa&s;&s;ionate man of for|tune marries a tender and weakly woman that is ever com|plaining; he affectionately &s;ympathizes with her in all her complaints, and exerci&s;es a very &s;en&s;ible and peculiar plea|&s;ure of his own, in giving her tho&s;e con&s;tant proofs of his affection, in the attention he &s;hows to her wants; and receiv|ing hers in return, which he could not do in a woman other|wi&s;e con&s;tituted. Al&s;o a very good-natured man married to a pa&s;&s;ionate, &s;evere-tongued, though otherwi&s;e good wife; when &s;he is &s;uddenly provoked, he is remarkably plea&s;ed with tho&s;e &s;udden &s;allies of her wit and eloquence, although it &s;hould be directed again&s;t him&s;elf; he looks upon them as marks of her wit and &s;pirit, and attention to her bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>A very pa&s;&s;ionate couple that &s;ometimes vent their full rage at each other on certain occa&s;ions, having fully &s;atisfied their re&s;entment, their a&s;&s;ection returns again to each other,
<PB N="9" REF="021076_0009_0FB22FB1C73AFB90">like a tide, with more fondne&s;s than before, and rather en|crea&s;es than abates affection.</P>
<P>Cruelty to children is &s;o unnatural, one would be tempt|ed to think it could not exi&s;t, did not experience evince it: it mu&s;t proceed from affections wholly mi&s;placed on objects quite di&s;tinct from the human being, and them&s;elves tor|mented with &s;ome kind of pa&s;&s;ions or de&s;ires unlawful, un|&s;atisfactory, or impo&s;&s;ible to be enjoyed; or what will be found to be the &s;ame thing, when kind and natural affection on companions to each othr is lo&s;t, and bitterne&s;s and cruel|ty &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>A liberal and a mercenary, a polite and an impolite, a can|did and a deceitful di&s;po&s;ition, are unhappy united together; but happy if their qualities are alike. But more un&s;uitable &s;till are tho&s;e of religious and irreligious principles when they are united together.</P>
<P>A couple kept low in the world by the hand of Providence only, go through a &s;eries of trials, hard&s;hips and difficulties together in rai&s;ing a family; their affections and attachments encrea&s;e, like two ca&s;t away &s;eamen, or unfortunate &s;oldiers, that have been companions, and &s;hared the &s;ame toils, tra|vels, dangers, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es together, and mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other for a long &s;eries of time, have a greater attach|ment to each other than they can po&s;&s;ibly have to any el&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>Moreover there are incidental circum&s;tances that will en|tirely de&s;troy the happy marriage-union; lying, that father and mother of all wickedne&s;s, becau&s;e it &s;creens and protects it, is yet unre&s;trained and unpuni&s;hed by any law, civil or religious; and hateful as it is to God and man, doubtle&s;s prevails among &s;ome of tho&s;e e&s;teemed the be&s;t, as well as the wor&s;t of mankind: I &s;ay lying is in full practice among us, and one judicious, well framed tale, by a malicious per&s;on, will excite &s;uch &s;ecret jealou&s;y, unea&s;ine&s;s, and doubts of each other, and open the way for &s;o many more of the &s;ame kind, of whatever kind they may be; they &s;el|dom or never are got over, but foment, by degrees, to the greate&s;t hatred and rancour.</P>
<P>Some are compelled to marry through the force, fraud, deception, or artifice of their friends or others, and con|ceive the greate&s;t aver&s;ion immediately. We do not &s;ay the&s;e will not ever be reconciled to each other, but that much &s;maller matters of di&s;turbance, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed, will render them thoroughly irreconcilable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021076_0010_0FB232ED0E700B80">
The la&s;t in&s;tance we &s;hall mention, is, a violent, unchang|able affection for &s;ome other per&s;on be&s;ides tho&s;e unto whom they are married. William Penn, &s;omewhere &s;ays, marry a woman thou love&s;t, or thou wilt love a woman thou never married; this may be equally true when we cea&s;e to love tho&s;e unto whom we are married.</P>
<P>It may be thought needle&s;s, perhaps, to mention tho&s;e inci|dents that &s;o &s;eldom happen, but we believe it very often happens, &s;ometimes to our certain knowledge, perhaps much oftener than can ea&s;ily be conceived; and when that is the ca&s;e very great di&s;turbance mu&s;t en&s;ue; in public places they are likely to happen mo&s;t frequently, but it is not likely they &s;hould often come to any ones knowledge, much le&s;s to the public: more e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the powerful effect of &s;hame, and the propen&s;ity it has to conceal what is thought to be a di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ion. Read the accounts phy&s;icians &s;ometimes give of mode&s;t women, of otherwi&s;e unblemi&s;hed character, actually expiring in child-birth, in the mo&s;t excru|ciating tortures, rather than own their &s;ituation, although came&s;tly urged to it with promi&s;es of &s;ecrecy, and this is be|cau&s;e they were unmarried, and thought it would be a di&s;|grace they could never &s;urvive.</P>
<P>Plutarch relates an anecdote of the Mile&s;ian virgins, which merits the attention of the philo&s;opher: "Multitudes fell by their own hands, doubtle&s;s in that trying age when nature, giving birth to re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent de&s;ires, inflames the imagination, and when the heart, a&s;toni&s;hed at new wants which virtue forbids to gratify, feels pining melancholy &s;uc|ceed to the &s;portful tranquillity of child-hood. Nothing could &s;top the contagion; a law was made condemning the fir&s;t who &s;hould be guilty of &s;elf-murder, to be brought naked and expo&s;ed in the market place; tho&s;e young women were not afraid of death, but they were afraid of &s;hame even af|ter death. Not one of them, henceforth, made an attempt on her life."</P>
<P>It had more became the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the le|gi&s;lature to have prevented, if po&s;&s;ible, the temptation, than to have inflicted a puni&s;hment wor&s;e than death, on a crime that proceeded from the powerful effect of nature only, and that in its mo&s;t innocent &s;tate and &s;tage of life.</P>
<P>We have had accounts lately of the Reverend Mr. Hack|man, falling violently in love with a Mi&s;s Ray; a lady who lived &s;ixteen years in the family of lord Sandwich by whom &s;he had nine children; he grew &s;o in&s;upportable to him&s;elf, that he meditated the de&s;truction of both her and him&s;elf; he loaded two pi&s;tols, and as &s;he was entering a coach he
<PB N="11" REF="021076_0011_0FB232EE8FE98838">di&s;charged one at her and &s;hot her dead, and the other at him&s;elf, without effect; then delivered him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice and was executed. This appears to have been the ca&s;e by his confe&s;&s;ion, in the pathetic &s;peech he made at his trial.</P>
<P>And here we might fill a chapter with quotations, but as they generally mi&s;lead the Reader, we will omit them. But to what other account can we &s;o rea&s;onably attribute the &s;trange di&s;turbance of mind we &s;ee people undergo, without knowing the cau&s;e: the many di&s;orders be&s;ides melancholy, dejection of &s;pirits, di&s;traction and &s;uicide, phy&s;icians tell us, proceed from a di&s;turbance of mind. All our pa&s;&s;ions en|crea&s;e with age though more concealed; this, as well as others; and we believe the mo&s;t gentle, mild and friendly di&s;po&s;itions, are the mo&s;t likely to be liable thereto.</P>
<P>Thus we have recited a great many cau&s;es;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More cau&s;es might be enumerated, e&s;pecially in &s;econd marriages, but tho&s;e we have recited are &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent de&s;ign.</NOTE> any one of them may be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the felicity of marriage, and render perfectly mi&s;erable that union, that &s;hould, of all things in this world, yield us the mo&s;t perfect enjoyment; or, at lea&s;t, &s;weeten the bitter potion that &s;o frequently falls to the lot of human nature.</P>
<P>But it often happens that many of the&s;e cau&s;es do unite and join in one and the &s;ame effect, and proportionably en|crea&s;e the mi&s;chief they tend to create; and when that is the ca&s;e, who can conceive the di&s;turbance they may probably give, or a remedy equal to the di&s;ea&s;e, other than a &s;epara|tion.</P>
<P>And now we are come to the &s;econd part of our ob&s;erva|tions.</P>

<P>BUT it may not be improper, in the fir&s;t place, to &s;et forth the ble&s;&s;ings and advantages of an happy union in mar|riage, in order that the different con&s;equences may appear more di&s;tinctly in the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>When each party with &s;incere, mutual affection, and good di&s;po&s;itions, nearly equal in fortune, and with the approbation of parents and friends, the &s;ame in education and way of life and religion; are fortunately joined together in marriage, all things &s;eem then to &s;trengthen the union and not de&s;troy it; &s;uch appear to every one as if actuated by one &s;oul, a mo&s;t

Their relatives by marriage, on each &s;ide, in&s;tead of detract|ing from, are commending them to each other, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the world; and the bulk of mankind appear to them as the mo&s;t upright and friendly beings in nature. And as their pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires are moderate, they &s;ee things nearly as they are, and plan their conduct more wi&s;e accordingly; and as they feel their &s;pirits lively, they are active in bu&s;ine&s;s, and if their circum&s;tance is but middling in the world, their gains are &s;ure and con&s;tant, and in a few years are encrea&s;ed beyond expectation.</P>
<P>Their good example not only &s;preads a kind of lu&s;tre round them, and communicates its likene&s;s every where, but operates as an impenetrable guard to their character; if ma|lice or ill-will &s;hould rai&s;e a tale of calumny again&s;t them, it dies where it begins, and its author is dete&s;ted. Their children partake of the good qualities of the parents, both by nature and example. Thus it will appear, if the above ca&s;e is truly &s;tated, that happine&s;s cau&s;es virtue and not vir|tue happine&s;s, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed; and whoever will be &s;ufficiently attentive to what pa&s;&s;es in his own brea&s;t, will be &s;atisfied of the truth of the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But now let us rever&s;e the &s;cene: a man and a woman of good di&s;po&s;itions naturally, but who unfortunately marry un|der one, or all, of the before-mentioned di&s;advantages, have all the evils re&s;ulting from them; their little comforts leave them one, by one, and peace and tranquility become &s;trangers to their brea&s;ts; and &s;inding them&s;elves mi&s;erable at home, they mu&s;t and will &s;eek enjoyment &s;omewhere; we have men|tioned the danger of an unchangeable affection where it can|not be indulged, and &s;urely we need not mention the many wandering imaginations and de&s;ires of every kind; the many pa&s;times, amu&s;ements, and, perhaps, vices that mu&s;t and will en&s;ue; the continual increa&s;e and exerci&s;e of all the vicious.
<PB N="13" REF="021076_0013_0FB232F24E4BA330">irritating pa&s;&s;ions and plea&s;ures; we need not be particular, the bad example they &s;et to others, and the many innocent people they draw into their practices; the lo&s;s of time, ne|glect of oeconomy, di&s;regard of their worldly intere&s;ts; or, if re&s;trained from the&s;e by religion, the fear of loo&s;ing their reputation, or of excommunication; then melancholy, extreme avarice, or pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ires after worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and honours alone, as their only enjoyment, frequently take place: here they have the men of the world to contend with and oppo&s;e; intere&s;t again&s;t intere&s;t, and honour again&s;t honour; a thou&s;and cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, unavoida|bly inter&s;ere and irritate them; every affront makes an in|curable wound; every virtuous feeling is &s;acrificed for the &s;malle&s;t gain; the greate&s;t &s;everity is u&s;ed in their families to gain an e&s;tate, and the greate&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;hone&s;ty abroad; in either ca&s;e their vices are &s;o con&s;picuous that the vir|tuous part of mankind become their enemies; their enjoyments are precarious, unnatural and un&s;atisfactory, and their &s;ouls &s;till wandering in &s;earch of what they cannot find, and being extremely wretched them&s;elves, they cannot help &s;triving to make others &s;o by detraction, from envy, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and views of competition: all mankind are intere&s;ted in oppo&s;|ing them in their own kind, and do it accordingly; which makes the whole ma&s;s appear to them as a race of devils, and the unhappy wretch is viewed in the &s;ame light by others. Their children are mi&s;-u&s;ed and mi&s;-taught, both by precept and example; and all the evil they intend others is generally returned back on them&s;elves ten&s;old. As old age advan|ces and naturally draws them toward their latter end, their plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e are abated; they can only exerci&s;e reflec|tion on what is pa&s;t and what is to come; weakne&s;s and di|&s;ea&s;es encrea&s;e, and give them warning the awful period is not far off, when their being and exi&s;tence here mu&s;t cea&s;e, and they mu&s;t give way to another generation. Alas, on what can they reflect but on a long life pa&s;t of extreme wretch|edne&s;s and pain, amid&s;t &s;urrounding felicity? On the many ways and means they have u&s;ed to afflict others, and others them, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e who &s;hould have been the dear companion of their lives? and al&s;o of the manifold &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions they have committed, in con&s;equence thereof? And la&s;tly, on what is to come? How &s;hall we de&s;cribe it, &s;eems it not like a dark and hedious mon&s;ter &s;tretching forth her dreadful jaws to clo&s;e upon the trembling wretch forever? And this is the final end and final hope of him, or her, who but a &s;ew years before thought, that binding them&s;elves in the
<PB N="14" REF="021076_0014_0FB232F3CFD6DAF8">bands of wedlock, was leaping into the lap of Paradi&s;e, and entering in the &s;ure road to heaven and happine&s;s, and the joy of angels. And yet, unwelcome as this pro&s;pect of final di&s;&s;olution appears, it &s;eems it is more welcome, oftentimes, than a being in this world under the before-mentioned di&s;a|greeable circum&s;tances. But neverthele&s;s, we do not pretend to &s;ay, that all this is the certain con&s;equence of infelicity in marriage; but only that it mo&s;t frequently is &s;o. Notwith|&s;tanding con&s;tant private devotion, frequent conver&s;ation with &s;incere friends, or engagement in &s;ome very plea&s;ing &s;tudy or employment, will in a good degree &s;upply the deficiency of marriage bli&s;s, and prevent, in a mea&s;ure, the evil con&s;equen|ces. But are we to expect every one wi&s;e, or fortunate enough to obtain them? if they are not, their misfortunes are without remedy. And here the &s;cene is changed; misfortunes produce vice, in&s;tead of vice producing misfortunes, as is mo&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed; or rather that they go hand in hand, and promote each other.</P>
<P>Thus, if the foregoing ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, there appears to have been one general mi&s;take, that teachers in religion, morali&s;ts, and mankind in general have adopted; that is, that rea&s;on doth, or ought, to pre&s;ide over our affections, when the fact in reality is otherwi&s;e; our rea&s;on, commonly &s;o cal|led, neither can, doth, nor ought to govern our affections, but only regulate them, and govern our actions and contrive and contribute means to indulge them; if our affections did not rule, neither man nor woman would ever marry, or pro|pagate their kind, labour for po&s;terity, or hazard their lives in defence of their friends without reward, or do any thing through pity, compa&s;&s;ion, or di&s;intere&s;ted regard to their kind; or, in other words, be good or virtuous; but exceed bea&s;ts in &s;avagene&s;s and yet be le&s;s wi&s;e. And our affections, if &s;trong, will be found, in reality, rather to encrea&s;e, in pro|portion to the endeavours we u&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s them; becau&s;e it cau&s;eth us to meditate on the object of our affection or aver&s;ion, and by con&s;tant meditation to fix our love or hatred more durable than before: neither can we ea&s;ily expel from our thoughts, the object of our attention, if a lively &s;en&s;ation of the good or evil we have received from them be often pre|&s;ent. And it is the duty of rulers and in&s;tructors, to lead and direct our good affections, and to indulge them in good and worthy objects, and not to force them, otherwi&s;e they will be found to exert them&s;elves like forced waters and break the &s;tronge&s;t bounds; or &s;ecretly undermine the works of the workman, to their great damage and hurt. For our evil af|fections
<PB N="15" REF="021076_0015_0FB232F54B98A0C0">are frequently no other than our good affections forc|ed, or mi&s;led from their proper objects; and this indulgence of our good affections is the only &s;ure way of preventing our evil ones, otherwi&s;e one mi&s;chief begets another, and we pu+ni&s;h misfortune in&s;tead of vice; it is like an un&s;kilful &s;urgeon that cuts off a limb he can not cure, to hide his ignorance and &s;ave his credit.</P>

<P>THE reflections that naturally and unavoidably ari&s;e from the above recited facts and con&s;iderations, are: doth God require this &s;acrifice of our happine&s;s, or in other words, ac|compli&s;hment of our de&s;truction? or, would not this &s;uppo&s;i|tion be more applicable to the enemy of mankind, who, they &s;ay, goes about like a roaring lion &s;eeking whom he may devour? If our Creator &s;eeketh or rejoiceth in our infelicity, for what purpo&s;e did he pour forth in the creation &s;uch a profu&s;ion of ornaments and delights? delightful objects for &s;en&s;ation and reflection; &s;uch multitudes of fruits and and flowers, meats and drinks, plea&s;ing objects for the eyes, and &s;ounds for the ears, and grateful &s;mells for the no&s;trils, and ten thou&s;and plea&s;ing &s;ubjects of contemplation for the under&s;tanding; and herbs for food and for medicine, and remedies for almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o various and numerous, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate them in every part of the creation.</P>
<P>The pangs of child-birth are to give life and joy to the child and parent; the pains of &s;ickne&s;s and wounds to con|fine the patient to his bed until he is healed, and to warn him to take e&s;pecial care of that tender frame his Maker hath been plea&s;ed to give him, and his &s;en&s;ations of pain and plea|&s;ure are his motives to action and means of happine&s;s. But for what end was unhappy matrimony in&s;tituted or compelled to be born, when there is an ea&s;y remedy always at hand, and not denied to the meane&s;t &s;lave, that of changing his or her ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>And as &s;lave-keeping is ju&s;tly becoming dete&s;table in this country, it may not be improper, in this place, to make a com|pari&s;on between a &s;lave and an unhappy, married free per&s;on: &s;o that a relief may appear as nece&s;&s;ary to the one as to the other, if the married per&s;on, as &s;uch, may be e&s;teemed equally worthy of our attention and regard.</P>

And although always at call to come and go, yet their common portion of labour is &s;eldom equal to that of a free per&s;on; they mo&s;tly eat the &s;ame kind of food with their ma&s;ter, their cloaths are &s;uffici|ent to keep them from &s;uffering; they are relieved from the care and concern of providing for them&s;elves and &s;amilies: bodily correction they can mo&s;tly avoid by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and fair promi&s;es, and this they often regard no longer than it &s;marts. which is &s;oon over; they are not confined to their ma&s;ter's apartment, to be always tormented and abu&s;ed; they have frequent holidays of &s;port, recreation, and pa&s;time, at which they contrive to crib for a fea&s;t, and revel the whole night in merriment; where the mo&s;t unre&s;trained liberty and joy abounds; they are under no re&s;traint from religion, mo|rality or fear of lo&s;ing their reputation, or of excummuni|cation; their love is all delight; they feel no dread from fu|ture con&s;equences; they marry with whom, and for as long as they plea&s;e, and no longer.</P>
<P>They are all of one &s;entiment in morality and religion; they are always e&s;teemed by their ma&s;ters and others, if they perform their &s;ervice faithfully, and when age comes on they are &s;ure of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for life, as good and much ea&s;i|er than when young.</P>
<P>But where is there any relief to the mi&s;erable, hen-pecked hu&s;band, or the abu&s;ed, and in&s;ulted, de&s;pi&s;ed wife? We for|bear to recite the many ways and means they take to afflict and torment one another.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That the pains of the mind exceed tho&s;e of the body we may learn from hence: heroes, martyrs and tho&s;e per&s;ecuted for religion, receive the greate&s;t bodily torments not only with patience, but tokens of plea|&s;ure, and &s;eek occa&s;ions of receiving them when they think the cau&s;e they are &s;uffering for redounds to their honour or glory.

<P>But perhaps it may be &s;aid, that if mankind were at liberty to &s;eparate and marry again, the matrimonial tie would become le&s;s binding; one &s;eparation would make way for another, and men and women would change from one to another like bea&s;ts and their families and kindred would be unknown and unprovided for, and their names and de&s;tinctions lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="021076_0017_0FB232F84DE9B8C8">
We &s;hould not propo&s;e to &s;et men and women wholly at liberty to &s;eparate and marry at plea&s;ure; but only on com|plaint of each or either party, and the cau&s;e inquired into, and their children, if any, provided for out of their e&s;tate equally, and liberty given to marry again and their e&s;tate di|vided between them; but not at liberty to repeat the like often. This much might &s;erve for a trial. But we do not &s;uppo&s;e an inclination to part would often happen, or any inconvenience ari&s;e, if they were left wholly at liberty in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>For we &s;ee, in the order of the creation, tho&s;e creatures who bring forth their young quite helple&s;s into the world, where the female alone is unable to defend and provide for them, nature has impelled them, by &s;ecret and powerful in&s;tinct, to pair together in couples for their mutual defence, and &s;up|port, without which it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to exi&s;t; as we &s;ee remarkably in birds and &s;ome bea&s;ts, that are helple&s;s when young; it is not &s;o in cattle that are able to &s;hift and provide for them&s;elves immediately.</P>
<P>And mankind, in a &s;tate of nature, all of one religion, cu&s;tom, and manners, never incline to &s;eparate, although not com|pelled to remain together; there appears to have been no in|citement thereto, as has ari&s;en through the various &s;tages and changes of our civilized &s;tate, without a change of cu&s;tom, as was nece&s;&s;ary in this re&s;pect; civilization having, in a man|ner, changed our natures, by introducing new kinds of &s;en&s;a|tions, as de&s;cribed in the foregoing part of this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>And as there is no creature nearly &s;o helple&s;s as the hu|man &s;pecies in infancy, &s;o neither is their any nearly &s;o vio|lently attached to each other; not in the way of &s;udden pa&s;&s;i|on, but unchangable affection. Providence having wi&s;ely proportioned their affections, in &s;uch a degree as the nece&s;&s;ity of their nature and &s;ituation requires, in order to go through and bear a &s;eries of trials, troubles, anxieties, and cares, needful to rai&s;e and &s;upport their otherwi&s;e helple&s;s offspring.</P>
<P>And when the human &s;pecies are confined, in their choice, to tho&s;e of the &s;ame way of life, manners, religion, or edu|cation, and unite through mutual affection, they are direct|ed by &s;ecret in&s;tinct to tho&s;e who&s;e tempers, qualities and di&s;po&s;itions are mo&s;t &s;uitable to their own. Or if it does not, it is mo&s;tly owing to &s;ome &s;eparate views, &s;uch as the pro&s;pect of an e&s;tate or other circum&s;tances, or perhaps, when too much confined in their choice, as is the ca&s;e with &s;ome young people re&s;trained by their parents, (to u&s;e my former &s;imilie) like confined waters breaking bounds, too &s;udden a flow of
<PB N="18" REF="021076_0018_0FB232FA8DE148A0">pa&s;&s;ion en&s;ues toward tho&s;e objects whom chance pre&s;ents to their view and acquaintance, and overcomes and preci|pitates them into a union, before they have time to ex|amine their own brea&s;ts; or, in other words, pa&s;&s;ion overcomes their judgment, when both &s;hould unite together in forming the happy connection.</P>
<P>Living together as man and wife, is, doubtle&s;s, as old as the creation; but many ages pa&s;&s;ed away before any form of marri|age was in&s;tituted, and the man took the woman with the parents' con&s;ent, and lived with her, and &s;he became his wife.</P>
<P>Thus we read of Abraham &s;ending his &s;ervant to take a wife for his &s;on I&s;aac; he did according to his in&s;tructions and brought her home with the con&s;ent of her parents, and I&s;aac received and took her into his Mother's tent, and he loved her and &s;he became his wife; and this was all the ceremony; the whole of the tran&s;action is very particularly related by the hi&s;torian, and &s;o material a circum&s;tance as marriage would not have been le&s;t out. It was nearly the &s;ame with Jacob; he agreed to &s;erve Laban &s;even years for his daughter Rachel, and they &s;eemed to him but a &s;ew days for the love he had to her, and at the end of the time he &s;aid, give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es allowed a man to put away his wife at plea&s;ure, yet we do not find that it was often practi&s;ed; but on the con|trary, they had the greate&s;t difficulty to &s;eparate tho&s;e who mar|ried into &s;trange nations in the time of the Jewi&s;h captivity, as may be &s;een in Ezra, chapters ix. and x. and we read in Nehemiah, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, in the xiiith. chap. and 25th. ver&s;e, that he contended with them; and cur&s;ed them, and &s;mote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and cau&s;|ed them to &s;wear by God, &s;aying, you &s;hall not give your daughters unto their &s;ons, nor take their daughters unto your &s;ons, or for your&s;elves. So &s;en&s;ible were the Jews of the impropriety of &s;trange marriages; yet we do not read that a &s;eparation was really e&s;&s;ected. The&s;e in&s;tances &s;how how little danger there is of &s;eparations becoming too fre|quent.</P>
<P>But it is probable they will become more nece&s;&s;ary, and frequent as our manners &s;hall become changed and varied from tho&s;e of the primitive ages: but never, in no age or nation, was marriage e&s;teemed any other than a civil contract, or any thing &s;o divine, holy, or &s;acred in it that it might not be di&s;&s;olved by the parties contracting, until Chri&s;tianity took place, which leads us naturally to con&s;ider of Chri&s;t's command in this re&s;pect: if there was any thing in the
<PB N="19" REF="021076_0019_0FB232FC0FD67D38">Chri&s;tian doctrine that would tend to de&s;troy the peace and happine&s;s of mankind, we &s;hould be apt to reject it entire|ly, as &s;omething that had got in by mi&s;take. But perhaps it may appear otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees came unto him, tempting him; &s;aying, <HI>Is it lawful for a man to put away his wi&s;e for every cau&s;e?</HI> The que&s;tion is doubtful in every &s;en&s;e, for they came to him, tempt|ing him. It is impo&s;&s;ible, without hearing the words &s;poken, to determine the full meaning of the que&s;tion, for if the em|pha&s;is of the &s;peaker &s;hould be placed on the words <HI>lawful;</HI> the que&s;tion would then be, not concerning who might put her away, or for what cau&s;e, but if a &s;eparation at all was <HI>lawful.</HI> If the empha&s;is of the &s;peaker &s;hould be placed on the word <HI>man,</HI> the que&s;tion would then be, not concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the &s;eparation, or for what cau&s;e, but if the <HI>hu&s;band</HI> alone, without con&s;ent of his wife or any other per&s;on, might put her away.</P>
<P>But if the empha&s;is &s;hould be placed on the word <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> the que&s;tion would then be, not concerning who might put her away, or the lawfulne&s;s of the &s;eparation, but whether &s;he might be put away for <HI>every cau&s;e,</HI> or only <HI>&s;ome cau&s;es,</HI> and as the que&s;tion is doubtful, &s;o is the an&s;wer. He tells them, in the beginning God created male and female, for which cau&s;e a man &s;hould leave father and mother, cleave unto his wife, and they twain &s;hould be one fle&s;h; what therefore God hath joined together let not man put a&s;under. That Mo&s;es indulged them in putting away their wives on account of their hard hearts; that it was not &s;o in the beginning, that who&s;oever put away his wife, except for fornication, and married again, committed adultery.</P>
<P>In the fore part of his di&s;cour&s;e he undoubtedly referred to that &s;ecret and powerful in&s;tinct, or &s;trong mutual affec|tion, that joined men and women together as at the begin|ning, in a &s;tate of nature; &s;uch as we before ob&s;erved unit|ed Jacob unto Rachel when &s;even years &s;eemed but as a few days, for the love he had unto her, and the&s;e he calls tho&s;e whom God hath joined together; and &s;uch let not man put a&s;under, he could not mean the prie&s;t, the magi&s;trate, or them&s;elves, for they are not God.</P>
<P>In the next place, he &s;orbids the cruel cu&s;tom of the hu&s;|band alone putting away his wife for every cau&s;e; without regarding her &s;eeling or &s;ituation, and declares, &s;uch as do and marry again, commit adultery.</P>
<P>The whole of the di&s;cour&s;e amounts to this, that &s;uch as are joined together by &s;trong, mutual affection, let none cau&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="021076_0020_0FB232FD8DA627E8">their &s;eparation, and let the hu&s;band alone put away his wife for no cau&s;e but fornication.</P>
<P>Neither of which declarations affects our argument in the lea&s;t, that men and women may not part by mutual con&s;ent, or laws of the land, or when mutual hatred has taken place, and marry again when God &s;hall join them together as at the beginning. But it &s;eems as if this pa&s;&s;age had been the occa&s;ion of all tho&s;e &s;cruples, concerning the &s;eparation of man and wife, in the early ages of Chri&s;tianity, and handed down to us until this day.</P>
<P>And &s;o it &s;hould &s;eem from the three &s;ucceeding ver&s;es of of the &s;ame chapter, Matthew xix. from ver&s;e the 10th. to the 13th. compared with Matthew, chapter v. from the 27th. to the 31&s;t. ver&s;e, as if ema&s;culation was advi&s;ed; and as &s;uch, &s;ome of the fir&s;t fathers of the church believed it, and received it; but &s;urely &s;uch doctrines need not a &s;erious re|futation.</P>
<P>And here we &s;ubmit to the judicious Reader, what merit is due to tho&s;e (the greater part of mankind) who implicitly &s;ollow guides; and what to tho&s;e who reject them, in many ca|&s;es, in favour of common &s;en&s;e and their own under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>If our Creator, as we before ob&s;erved, &s;eeketh or requireth our infelicity, he hath then no longer the attribute of a God, but of a devil. But if our good affections are mi&s;led by our in&s;tructors, they are converted into evil affections, and drawn from their proper objects, while we our&s;elves have eyes to &s;ee and hearts to under&s;tand, then is our Creator guiltle&s;s. For if we, having eyes and under&s;tanding, freely give them to our guides and walk without, then are our &s;elves on|ly accountable for our &s;tumbling and the pains and brui&s;es we feel in con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>It will be next &s;aid, what has been the univer&s;al cu&s;tom for &s;o many ages, mu&s;t have had &s;ome great advantage or benefit ari&s;ing therefrom; &s;ound out by the experience of pa&s;t ages that we cannot immediately apprehend, but upon a trial, otherwi&s;e would be found extremely injurous to &s;oci|ety. This obliges us, as far as we know, to relate the cu&s;toms of other countries.</P>
<P>The Indians of America and Negroes of Africa, and &s;a|vage nations of various kinds, live according to nature, that is, they unite or part, as plea&s;es them, without compul&s;ion; generally unite and live as man and wife, and are faithful to each other as long as they live agreeably to natural in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>In France and Italy every man has but one wife, but eve|ry wife has, if &s;he plea&s;es, a lover that con&s;tantly vi&s;its and attends her, with her hu&s;band, to all public places, and
<PB N="21" REF="021076_0021_0FB232FF194F56F0">the hu&s;band looks upon him as his friend, and e&s;teems his wife in proportion to the rank and quality of her lover; this gives him no unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e he act in the &s;ame capacity to another lady, if he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>In England, it is &s;aid, the nobility marry to add to their rank and e&s;tates, but indulge &s;eparate plea&s;ures afterwards, at plays, balls, ma&s;querades, dancing matches, and other diver&s;ions, without offence taken on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>In Turkey a man may have four wives and as many con|cubines as he plea&s;es, but if a complaint comes to a magi&s;|trate that he doth not perform the duty of an hu&s;band once a week, he is obliged to put &s;ome of them away. In Per&s;ia a man takes as many wives as he plea&s;es, and for what time they agree.</P>
<P>In India the women are compelled, by the cu&s;tom of the country, to burn them&s;elves alive with their di&s;ea&s;ed hu&s;|band, in honour to their memory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;ome of our Readers may incline to doubt the truth of this account, we refer them to Doctor Hard's Hi&s;tory of the Religion of different Nations, where they may &s;ee the practice largely and par|ticularly related. Al&s;o Marius D'A&s;&s;igny, in his Hi&s;tory of the Hea|then Deities, faith it is a cu&s;tom of the indians in A&s;ia to this day to &s;acrifice and bury the deare&s;t wives of Princes with them; for they believe in the immortality of the &s;oul, and therefore &s;end &s;uch per&s;ons as have been dear to them, to &s;erve them in another world, and keep them company; but later <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ay the practice is falling into di&s;u&s;e all over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> This is fulfilling the text literally, what God hath joined together, let no man put a&s;under; and &s;hows the impropriety of adhering too &s;trictly to the letter, in matters of great importance to our welfare.</P>
<P>Here are two extremes, and it is mo&s;t probable, that there are different degrees of practice between them. And if we may judge rea&s;onably here, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, the be&s;t mark to &s;top at is the middle way, for the powers of nature in all animate, as well as inanimate bodies, gravitate to a middle line, like the vibrations of a pendulum, who&s;e center of gravity is equidi&s;tant from the extremes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> motion, and our pre&s;ent practice is but one degree di&s;tant from the la&s;t mentioned wor&s;t extreme.</P>
<P>From the above-mentioned in&s;tances it doth appear, the &s;entiments of mankind in general are very different from tho&s;e of our pre&s;ent practice, and that there are no inconve|niences ari&s;ing to the public from one cu&s;tom more than ano|ther, except the happine&s;s the parties may receive them&s;elves, and thereby communicate to others; which &s;urely them&s;elves ought to be the be&s;t judges of.</P>
<P>Then the que&s;tion will finally terminate here, are they, or are they not, judges of their own happine&s;s? If they are, why
<PB N="22" REF="021076_0022_0FB233008B9FEBF0">are they re&s;trained by law and religion from exerci&s;ing it? if they are not, why are they allowed the liberty of exerci&s;ing it in other things? why are they not compelled to follow the &s;ame calling, live on the &s;ame land, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame property they have received by gift or purcha&s;e during their lives, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;aid property? are not the rea|&s;ons for the one as &s;trong as for the other?</P>
<P>We would not, by any means, be under&s;tood, by propo&s;ing divorce, that we de&s;ire to le&s;&s;en the &s;olemnity of marriage, or weaken the &s;acredne&s;s of the marriage promi&s;e in any re|&s;pect, during their union; but only, that a &s;incere union of hearts do accompany a union of hands, from which alone, all our other enjoyments, as from a &s;ecret &s;ource, are derived: as &s;treams flowing from a &s;weet, clear, and pure fountain, without which every thing is lifele&s;s, in&s;iped and di&s;agreeable; and that in proportion to the di&s;harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts here, or on the contrary, all is plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>And here we beg leave to communicate our &s;entiments on marriage in the lines of that elegant and &s;ublime poet, who is &s;aid once to have employed his pen in vindicating the &s;ame cau&s;e we do now.</P>

<P>The above mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean virtuous plea&s;ure, in common occurrences and occa&s;ions of life, as well as tho&s;e of religion; and if &s;uch are its &s;alutary effects, what mu&s;t be the effect of the contrary, I leave the Reader to judge, by attending to his own feelings in &s;ome unhappy moments he may have experienced.</P>
<P>We believe it will be readily admitted, that there is no portion of the lives of mankind &s;o extremely plea&s;ant; as when about to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lovely and agreeable com|panion: except the enjoyment they may receive after|ward, in finding their expectations fully &s;atisfied: until &s;ome untoward circum&s;tance, incident, or misfortune puts an end to their felicity. And yet this ble&s;&s;ing, according to our pre|&s;ent practice, can never be enjoyed by one of the parties, but once in a life-time. And if their joys &s;hould chance to be &s;hort, all the re&s;t is little better than di&s;traction. In vain will they &s;trive to find them again in wealth, honours, or promotion; they may kindle the fires of hell, and ran&s;ack nations, or de&s;troy neighbours, according to their re&s;pective &s;ituations and capacities in life, yet they will &s;till meet with nothing but di&s;|appointment in their enjoyments. Or if there is any thing in this world, that would excite virtuous and amiable di&s;po&s;iti|ons in men and women, it is the thought and ambition of recommending them&s;elves to virtuous and amiable compani|ons; more e&s;pecially when in di&s;tre&s;s with one that is otherwi&s;e. The expectation of &s;uch good fortune if it &s;hould never hap|pen, would make them incline more to good, virtuous, and worthy actions than otherwi&s;e they would do.</P>
<P>If divorce was declared not only lawful by the legi&s;lature, but honourable by the mini&s;ters and elders of religious bodies, (without which, the law would not have its full effect) it would probably remove one of the mo&s;t melancholy misfortunes of the human being&mdash;&s;uicide.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may ob&s;erve, our Creator in framing the pa&s;&s;ions of the human &s;oul, has wi&s;ely pre&s;erved a balance between our private and public affections; in order to &s;ecure the duty we owe to others as well as our|&s;elves; for where there is a &s;trong propen&s;ity to private a&s;&s;ection, there is one equally &s;trong to the public&mdash;a love of reputation. And when a &s;trong private affection, no way interfering with the good of the pub|lic, is rendered infamous by means of law and religion; then the &s;oul is exceedingly agitated by different Impul&s;es; and &s;trongly impelled different ways and greviou&s;ly tormented. And if the &s;en&s;ation is vio|lent it will occa&s;ion involuntary watching or waking, and when this is the ca&s;e, body and mind reciprocally act as a &s;timulus upon each other, encrea&s;ing their &s;en&s;ations; until the &s;oul, inflamed with furious impatience, in&s;tantly bur&s;ts the &s;tronge&s;t bands and bounds of nature, and &s;lings her&s;elf into the ocean of &s;pirits from whence &s;he &s;prang. And the di&s;a&s;ter &s;peaks aloud to the world, in the mo&s;t pointed, explicit language, that may not be mi&s;taken; that the laws of men have per|verted the laws of Providence, and the&s;e cata&s;trophies are as beacons &s;et upon a hill that cannot be hid, to warn foreigners and all others of the danger of breathing the tainted air of &s;uch a &s;oil: for although the body may e&s;cape de&s;truction the &s;oul or mind may not, if we may pre|&s;ume the &s;ame cau&s;es to have the &s;ame effect, on the &s;ame kind of be|ings; and we believe if the number of the&s;e in this country, were &s;trict|ly taken and made public, they would greatly exceed what can ca&s;ily be imagined.</NOTE> For certainly it is a mo&s;t odious re|proach
<PB N="25" REF="021076_0025_0FB233052C130CF0">to the rulers of any people, to &s;ee their &s;ubjects go di&s;tracted and de&s;troy them&s;elves on account of their mi&s;-go|vernment, or misfortunes that might ea&s;ily be removed.</P>
<P>Cruel men and women would then be afraid to mi&s;u&s;e and abu&s;e their good, worthy partners, whom they know to be better than them&s;elves; but would be induced to act the lover in&s;tead of acting the tyrant.</P>
<P>It would probably prevent fraud and deception in court|&s;hip. It would tend greatly to indu&s;try, as men and women would exert them&s;elves much more to &s;upport tho&s;e they loved, than tho&s;e they did not; this is plain in the change we often &s;ee in young people, for the better or wor&s;e after mar|riage.</P>
<P>Parents might not then forever lament the lo&s;s of an only &s;on, or an only daughter, by an imprudent, precipitate mar|riage. Many bachelors might not then remain &s;o long un|married, and di&s;grace religion and mankind with their vices. Many young women would then become virtuous wives and mothers; comfortable to their friends, u&s;eful and ornamental to &s;ociety, who, as circum&s;tances are at pre&s;ent, do fre|quently bring di&s;grace upon them&s;elves and their &s;ex, and a burden on others. And we believe the like of the&s;e would not &s;o often be for&s;aken by tho&s;e who have deceived them, if the ideas of perpetual bondage did not intimidate them. Every plea whatever for unlawful commerce between the &s;exes would then be taken away. If rea&s;onable liberty of parting was given, the de&s;ire of it would be frequently re|moved. Continual enmity and ill-will between the relatives of the re&s;pective parties di&s;agreeing in marriage would cea&s;e. It would inculcate more friendly and beneficent ideas of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Divine Providence in the di&s;po&s;ition of human affairs, and di&s;po&s;e mankind more &s;incerely to re|verence and adore the great Author of their being.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021076_0026_0FB233068CF1D3D8">
If the number of objects that wi&s;h for a change are but few, their liberty can do no harm; if many, they ought to be the more regarded, and attention paid to their &s;ituations.</P>
<P>The offspring of happy matches would be, by nature as well as by education and example, le&s;s viciou&s;ly inclined. For we believe the qualities and di&s;po&s;itions that are contracted by habit, are propagated afterwards by generation, as is vi|&s;ible in the wildne&s;s and tamene&s;s of young animals from their re&s;pective parents: al&s;o in the ferocity and docility of tho&s;e per&s;ons de&s;cended from free or en&s;laved nations: like|wi&s;e the uncivilized nature of young &s;avages, longing to live the &s;ame &s;ort of life of their parents, although otherwi&s;e edu|cated.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be a &s;tep towards re&s;toring the golden age &s;o much de&s;ired, for certainly tho&s;e countries approach the neare&s;t to it where there are no wars, but where agriculture and population are in their highe&s;t perfection, as in China, where their cu&s;toms are very different from ours in this re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>Perhaps none would oppo&s;e this alteration but tho&s;e who were con&s;cious of having companions better than them&s;elves, and who might be apprehen&s;ive &s;uch would become di&s;&s;atisfi|ed with their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>No di&s;tinction of preference in favour of either &s;ex ought to be made when nature has made none.</P>
<P>Thus, free citizens of America, we have briefly and with|out any ornament of &s;tile, repre&s;ented to you &s;uch of the many truths, relative to our &s;ituation in re&s;pect to marriage, as mu&s;t &s;trike the apprehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t indifferent ob|&s;erver.

<P>We &s;hall now conclude, with addre&s;&s;ing a few words to tho&s;e on who&s;e behalf we have been writing this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>O ye unhappy people, unto whom the bands of wedlock has entailed wretchedne&s;s in&s;tead of joy! Perhaps your &s;ituations may be without remedy; it is &s;o, doubtle&s;s, without you &s;eek it, which it is your duty to do both for your&s;elves and for po&s;terity. But it is not without hope if you exert your&s;elves according to your ability; be not a&s;hamed of your &s;ituation; it is your misfortune and not your fault; either of you might have been completely ble&s;t and happy with ano|ther partner, had it been your good fortune to have united with one &s;uitable to your di&s;po&s;ition and circum&s;tances: but it is never too late to try to be revenged on fortune. Let your &s;ituation in life be what it may, your circum&s;tances high or low, if you can but be thoroughly reconciled to tho&s;e who where once your fond choice, and renew the days of court&s;hip and felicity you once felt, not only by avoiding every thing that is found to be di&s;agreeable to your &s;pou&s;es, but al&s;o exerting your&s;elves in every thing that is &s;ervicable, generous, kind and freindly; you will then be revenged on fortune, and heaven will have ble&s;&s;ings yet in &s;tore. But if this is not practicable, as is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e, apply decently to the legi&s;lature for redre&s;s, to pa&s;s &s;uch laws for your relief, and others in the like &s;ituation, as they &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary and proper; they certainly cannot refu&s;e &s;o rea&s;on|able a requi&s;ition who have granted relief to a le&s;s re&s;pecta|ble cla&s;s of mankind, without reque&s;t, in a le&s;s painful &s;itua|tion.
