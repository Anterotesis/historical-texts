<HEAD>THE CAUSE OF MAN.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN nature has been a theme of much di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. Among the ancients, &s;ome railed at man, and &s;ome ridiculed his imperfections. Certain modern philo&s;ophers make depravity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Critics may remember, that <HI>depravity,</HI> through the whole of this piece, &s;ignifies &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of heart as wi&s;hes univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of wretchedne&s;s.</NOTE> a part of their creed; and a&s;&s;ign the mo&s;t elevated &s;eat in Paradi&s;e to tho&s;e, who feel the mo&s;t perfect contempt for human nature. The catechi&s;ms of the&s;e &s;ages inform us, that man is malevolent; that his pa&s;&s;ions hurry him into wretchedne&s;s; and that his under&s;tanding is only another name for imperfection. Should individuals offer this for a de&s;cription of their own minds, per|haps ju&s;tice might read the character with &s;ilent ap|probation. When 'tis produced as the picture of man, the &s;ame ju&s;tice commands to wipe the a&s;per&s;ion from the portrait of our common nature.</P>
<P>If exalted actions flow from elevated &s;entiments, then, to e&s;tabli&s;h human dignity, and rea&s;on man into approbation of him&s;elf, mu&s;t be among the fir&s;t ad|vancements towards virtue.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, our ta&s;k, to plead the cau&s;e of man.</P>
<P>Let us examine his di&s;po&s;ition; con&s;ider the utility of his pa&s;&s;ions; &s;urvey the perfection of his under|&s;tanding, and ob&s;erve how far &s;urrounding creation &s;tands as monumental te&s;timony of human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030139_0003_0FE4A6DC694BAF90">From the &s;ituation of man, we may argue the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of benevolence in his di&s;po&s;ition. He was, doubtle&s;s, formed for happine&s;s. His de&s;ire of bli&s;s, and his powers of fruition, evince the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. His felicity depends, almo&s;t entirely, on &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Solitary, man is in want, in fear, in di&s;con&s;olation. A reciprocation of beneficence alone can make him happy. This he mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to perform, or he cannot fulfil the final cau&s;e of his nature. Man's de&s;tination for happine&s;s, and his mu|tual dependence, therefore, clearly originate the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of human benevolence.</P>
<P>Feeling and experience evince the benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition of man. A &s;ight of di&s;tre&s;s wounds the heart. A view of joy warms the &s;oul with gladne&s;s. We are plea&s;ed to remove pain. We rejoice to communicate delight. The&s;e things we could not perform without a di&s;po&s;ition to diffu&s;e felicity. This di&s;po&s;ition is all we mean by benevolence.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the heart of man malevolent, he mu&s;t then lo&s;e every &s;ocial &s;atisfaction. For who could receive tho&s;e mutual favours, which none were di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow? Man mu&s;t be condemned to &s;olitary mi&s;ery. Never would he wipe a tear from the eye of &s;orrow; never would he pour the balm of con&s;olation into the bo&s;om of grief. Nay, he would grieve at the ap|pearance of joy. He would eagerly di&s;&s;eminate wretchedne&s;s. Every benefaction of Providence would &s;well the tide of human mi&s;ery; and man could never &s;mile undi&s;turbed, while one joyous emotion exi&s;ted, even in the bo&s;om of Deity. Mu&s;t we be|lieve man endowed with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition? Yes, if we believe him malevolent. But can our rea|&s;on, our feelings, our experience, &s;ub&s;cribe to &s;uch a creed? No. For nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ympathy both evince man benevolent. Nor could he be otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s his &s;oul were blacker than the dunne&s;t fiend that fear-di&s;tempered fancy ever generated in the dark regions of mythology.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030139_0004_0FE4A6CFF60B0D70">Though man &s;tands vindicated from the charge of malevolence, yet has calumny blackened his character with other accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>Human pa&s;&s;ions have often been a mark for the ar|row of contumely. Au&s;terity condemns them, becau&s;e they are &s;ometimes irregular. As well might the &s;ame au&s;terity cur&s;e the elements of nature, becau&s;e the thunder, the earthquake, or the hurricane, &s;ometimes rend an oak, &s;plit a mountain, or &s;weep a kingdom into the ocean.</P>
<P>If we impartially look on our own nature, the utility of our pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t appear.</P>
<P>Man is, at times, in danger. Danger originates the nece&s;&s;ity of caution, and caution is &s;ecured by the pa&s;&s;ion of fear.</P>
<P>Unre&s;i&s;ting innocence invites the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion. To prevent a repetition of injury, omni&s;cient Deity planted the &s;eed of anger in the bo&s;om of man.</P>
<P>Self love, to &s;ome the mo&s;t odious of all the pa&s;&s;ions, is &s;till an emanation of benevolence. Like that, it has for its object the diffu&s;ion of felicity. It fir&s;t &s;e|cures our own enjoyment. It then offers our bo&s;om to a parent, to a friend, to our country, to the indi&s;cri|minate citizens of the world. Thus on &s;elf love are grafted philanthropy, patrioti&s;m, friend&s;hip, and all the tender growths of dome&s;tic charity.</P>
<P>A love of glory is the mo&s;t violent, exten&s;ive and durable, of all the pa&s;&s;ions. For glory, men encoun|ter toil, danger, and death it&s;elf. No pain, no labour, no toil&s;ome virtue, no arduous heroi&s;m, can be a price too dear to purcha&s;e immortal renown. A pa&s;&s;ion which thus di&s;po&s;es men to &s;acrifice ea&s;e, &s;afety, and life it&s;elf, to gain the applau&s;e of their fellow men, mu&s;t inviolably unite mankind, and lodge in every brea&s;t a pledge for the &s;ocial exertions of each indi|vidual.</P>
<P>Let the votaries of apathy decry the pa&s;&s;ions. What can be the felicity, what the virtue, of their pa&s;&s;ionle&s;s philo&s;opher? If man were void of &s;elf love, would
<PB N="6" REF="030139_0005_0FE4A6E26FE9CEE0">
the voice of native want rouze him from the &s;leep of indolence? What would &s;hield his bo&s;om from dan|ger, what would arm his hand with power, if fear did not teach him caution, and anger learn him to re&s;i&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of violence? Who would toil for man? who, with a &s;mile, would bleed on the altar of eman|cipation, if the God of nature had not with love of glory warmed the bo&s;om of man? De&s;titute of pa&s;|&s;ions, man had &s;tood, like the marble &s;tatue, without a motion; and eternally worn the &s;ame &s;mile or frown which the la&s;t touch of nature's hand left impre&s;&s;ed on his countenance.</P>
<P>Under&s;tanding claims our next attention. This forms a &s;plendid part of human nature. By this man perceives, remembers, rea&s;ons and imagines. Per|ception and memory principally &s;ub&s;erve the opera|tions of rea&s;on and imagination.</P>
<P>Guided by rea&s;on, man has travelled through the ab&s;tru&s;e regions of the philo&s;ophic world. He has originated rules by which he can direct the &s;hip through the pathle&s;s ocean, and mea&s;ure the comet's flight over the fields of unlimited &s;pace. He has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o|ciety and government. He can aggregate the profu|&s;ions of every climate, and every &s;ea&s;on. He can me|liorate the &s;everity, and remedy the imperfections, of nature her&s;elf. All the&s;e things he can perform by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>By imagination, man &s;eems to verge towards crea|tive power. Aided by this, he can perform all the wonders of &s;culpture and painting. He can almo&s;t make the marble &s;peak. He can almo&s;t make the brook murmur down the painted land&s;cape. Often, on the pinions of imagination, he &s;oars aloft where the eye has never travelled; where other &s;tars glitter on the mantle of night, and a more effulgent &s;un lights up the blu&s;hes of morning. Flying from world to world, he gazes on all the glories of creation: or, lighting on the di&s;tant margin of the univer&s;e, darts the eye of fancy over the mighty void, where power
<PB N="7" REF="030139_0006_0FE4A6CCE164CC30">
creative never yet has energized, where exi&s;tence &s;till &s;leeps in the wide aby&s;s of po&s;&s;ibility. By imagination he can travel back to the &s;ource of time; conver&s;e with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of men, and kindle into emulation while he &s;urveys the monumental tro|phies of ancient art and glory. He can &s;ail down the &s;tream of time until he lo&s;es <Q>&s;ight of &s;tars and &s;un, by wandering into tho&s;e retired parts of eternity, when the heavens and the earth &s;hall be no more.*</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e unequivocal characteri&s;tics of greatne&s;s in man, let us adduce the te&s;timony of nature her&s;elf. Surrounding creation &s;ub&s;erves the wants and pro|claims the dignity of man. For him day and night vi&s;it the world. For him the &s;ea&s;ons walk their &s;plen|did round. For him the earth teems with riches, and the heavens &s;mile with beneficence.</P>
<P>All creation is accurately adju&s;ted to his capacity for bli&s;s. He ta&s;tes the dainties of fe&s;tivity, breathes the perfumes of morning, revels on the charms of melody, and regales his eye with all the painted beau|ties of vi&s;ion. Whatever can plea&s;e, whatever can charm, whatever can expand the &s;oul with extacy of bli&s;s, allures and &s;olicits his attention. All things beautiful, all things grand, all things &s;ublime, appear in native loveline&s;s, and proffer man the riche&s;t plea|&s;ures of fruition.</P>
<P>Can he then rai&s;e his feelings too high in the &s;cale of &s;elf approbation? Can he &s;ufficiently abhor that con|tumely which perpetually babbles of human depravity? In man, is it not calumny again&s;t heaven? Is it not pointing the arrow of ingratitude again&s;t the munifi|cent bo&s;om of a God?</P>
<P>If man can rejoice in diffu&s;ion of felicity, is he not, like his Creator, benevolent? If his pa&s;&s;ions urge him to embrace the common intere&s;t of man, are they not u&s;eful? If his under&s;tanding guides him down the ca|reer of exi&s;tence, is it not perfect? If &s;urrounding creation waits on his wants, does it not, in the lan|guage
<PB N="8" REF="030139_0007_0FE4A6D866F42EE8">
of its Creator, talk aloud of human greatne&s;s? Do not all the&s;e &s;hining tints brighten on the portrait of man? Yes. He rejoices in munificence; he toils for univer&s;al felicity; he developes the my&s;teries of nature; he aggregates the goods of &s;pace, of dura|tion, and even arre&s;ts the attention of earth and heaven.</P>
<P>This thought elevates man high on the theatre of exi&s;tence, and places him full in view of a &s;urround|ing univer&s;e. It gives him an important part in the great drama of being. It tells him all intelligence are intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of his performance.</P>
<P>Yes, my countrymen, you arre&s;t the attention of &s;hining millions. On you are fixed the eyes of all that bright throng of departed patriots, philo&s;ophers and philanthropi&s;ts, who mea&s;ured their atchievements by the dignity of their nature; and who&s;e beatified &s;pirits, now leaning from the azure battlements of heaven, allure their followers up the &s;hining road to glory. You they hail as their genuine de&s;cendents; as the patrons of &s;cience; as the votaries of virtue; as the candidates of immortal beatitude.</P>

<P>WE know you are per&s;uaded that cu&s;tom alone does not give birth to this addre&s;s. We claim the privi|lege of telling the world how much we feel obliged. Gratitude cannot be refu&s;ed this &s;mall indulgence.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, &s;hould we attempt to narrate the merits of our benefactor, mode&s;ty might rai&s;e a &s;u&s;|picion of adulation; envy would deduce our panegyric from the partiality of our hearts; while the world would inform us, that the &s;cience, knowledge and phi|lanthrophy, of the man who has obliged us, are now become a theme of common conver&s;ation. We can, therefore, expre&s;s our gratitude only; and ardently wi&s;h that others, in pur&s;uit of &s;cience, may have the &s;ame director who has guided our &s;teps.</P>
<P>Yes, if ever our &s;ouls, in the &s;ilent moments of de|votion, have dared to heave a wi&s;hing &s;igh to heaven for a &s;ingle favour on our&s;elves&mdash;often, when we be|hold his face no more, often &s;hall that wi&s;h be repeat|ed, for the health and felicity of him, whom genera|tions yet unknown &s;hall learn to call their benefactor.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow-Students,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM unwilling to leave the &s;tage at this time, without addre&s;&s;ing a few words to you. You are &s;till in the career of collegiate acqui&s;ition. Still you enjoy tho&s;e means of information which are now forever &s;e|cluded from us. Pant not with too much eagerne&s;s for the day of emancipation. On that day, you will think the moments of your collegiate exi&s;tence have been few.</P>
<P>College is the world in miniature. There you may learn, not &s;cience only, but man him&s;elf. There you may examine each principle which actuates the human

heart. There you may trace every pa&s;&s;ion from its fir&s;t dawn, involved in the &s;hades of kindred emotions, through all its various pha&s;es, until it blazes out in all the meridian glow of action.</P>
<P>The votary of that &s;cience which does not mend the heart, is, by its influence, tran&s;muted into tenfold more a child of reprobation. Keep, therefore, your bo&s;oms alive to all the exqui&s;ite emotions of virtue.</P>
<P>Suffer not a noble emulation, by eagerne&s;s of pur|&s;uit, to be degenerated into envy. Envy triumphs only in the expiring agonies of merit.</P>
<P>Beware of that pa&s;&s;ion which throws the dun mantle of &s;u&s;picion over the white bo&s;om of innocence.</P>
<P>Li&s;ten not to the whi&s;per of &s;lander. Slander in|volves merit in darkne&s;s; as the black cloud of the north rolls over the brightne&s;s of heaven.</P>

<P>OFTEN, on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, from this place, the world has heard the pathetic narration of colle|giate joys that are pa&s;t. I will not pretend to deter|mine why this has been done. This narration may be all reality. It may be a cu&s;tomary &s;tory, told to lure from the eyes of pitying &s;pectators the tear of &s;ympa|thy, as a tribute grateful to valedician eloquence. It may be an ingenious artifice, woven to conceal the loath&s;ome vi&s;age of cla&s;&s;ical animo&s;ity.</P>

Why may not the white hand of charity throw the veil of forgetfulne&s;s over tho&s;e parts of our cla&s;|&s;ical exi&s;tence, which we cannot recollect without a painful emotion? Never will our bo&s;oms &s;often with a warmer glow of forgivene&s;s. Never, perhaps, &s;hall we all meet again, till we meet beyond the narrow &s;ea of time.

<P>Mu&s;t we then part? Yes, the dark curtain of &s;epa|ration is now drawing between us. In a few hours we behold each others faces no more. To-morrow's &s;un &s;hall &s;ee us &s;cattered over the face of the world. We mu&s;t now reciprocate a la&s;t adieu before a gazing mul|titude. This ta&s;k is ungrateful.
