<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> On the Nature and Con&s;titution of our Church.</HEAD>
<P>WE are thoroughly convinced, that the Church of England, to which we have been united, is deficient in &s;everal of the mo&s;t im|portant Parts of Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline; and that (a few Mini&s;ters and Members excepted) it has lo&s;t the Life and Power of Religion. We are not

ignorant of the Spirit and De&s;igns it has ever di&s;co|vered in Europe, of ri&s;ing to Pre-eminence and worldly Dignities by Virtue of a national E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and by the mo&s;t &s;ervile Devotion to the Will of temporal Governors: and we fear, the &s;ame Spirit will lead the &s;ame Church in the&s;e United States (tho' altered in its Name) to &s;imilar De&s;igns and Attempts, if the Number and Strength of its Members will ever afford a Probability of Succe&s;s; and particularly, to obtain a national E&s;tabli&s;hment which we cordially abhor as the great Bane of Truth and Holine&s;s, the greate&s;t Impediment in the World to the Progre&s;s of vital Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, we have thought it our Duty to form our&s;elves into an Independent Church. And as the mo&s;t excellent Mode of Church Govern|ment according to our mature&s;t Judgment, is that of <HI>a moderate Epi&s;copacy;</HI> and as we are per&s;uaded, <HI>that the uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops from the Apo&s;tles,</HI> can be proved neither from Scripture nor Antiquity; we therefore have con&s;tituted our&s;elves into an <HI>Epi&s;copal Church,</HI> under the Direction of <HI>Bi&s;hops, Elders, Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Preachers,</HI> according to the Forms of Ordination annexed to our Prayer Book, and the Regulations laid down in this Form of Di&s;cipline.</P>

<P>Ob&s;erve. It is not your Bu&s;ine&s;s to preach &s;o many Times, and to take Care of this or that Society: But to &s;ave as many Souls as you can; to bring as many Sinners as you po&s;&s;ibly can to Re|pentance, and with all your Power to build them up in that Holine&s;s, without which they cannot &s;ee the Lord.

Life? Are you groaning after it? Are you re&s;olved to devote your&s;elf wholly to God and his Work? Do you know the Rules of the Society? Of the Bands? Do you keep them? Do you con&s;tantly attend the Sacrament? Have you read the Form of Di&s;cipline? Are you willing to conform to it? Have you con&s;idered the Rules of a Preacher; e&s;pe|cially the fir&s;t, tenth and twelfth? Will you keep them for Con&s;cience Sake? Are you determined to employ all your Time in the Work of God? Will you endeavour not to &s;peak too long or too loud? Will you diligently in&s;truct the Children in every Place? Will you vi&s;it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e? Will you recommend Fa&s;ting or Ab&s;tinence, both by Precept and Example? Are you in Debt?</P>

Let every Dea|con explain this to them that are on Trial.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. Wherein lies our Danger of it?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. With Regard to Man's Faithfulne&s;s, Our Lord him&s;elf taught us to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion. Therefore we ought never to be a&s;hamed of it. We ought &s;teadily to a&s;&s;ert upon his Authority, that if a Man is not faithful in the unrighteou&s;s Mammon, God will not give him the true Riches.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to working for Life, which our Lord expre&s;sly commands us to do. Labour <HI>(erga|ze&s;the)</HI> literally <HI>work for the Meat that endureth to everla&s;ting Life.</HI> And in Fact every Believer till he comes to Glory, works for, as well as from Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have received it as a Maxim, that "A Man is to do nothing in order to Ju&s;tification:" Nothing can be more fal&s;e. Whoever de&s;ires to find Favour with God, &s;hould cea&s;e from Evil, and learn to do well. So God Him&s;elf teaches by the Prophet I&s;aiah. Whoever repents, &s;hould do Works meet for Repentance: And if this is not in order to find Favour, what does he do for them?</P>
<P>Once more review the whole Affair.</P>
<P N="1">1. Who of us is now accepted of God?</P>
<P>He that now believes in Chri&s;t with a loving, obedient Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. But who among tho&s;e that never heard of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>He that according to the Light he has, &s;careth God, and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is this the &s;ame with, He that is &s;incere?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="020522_0025_0FAF3A6E1C27B3E0">Nearly, if not quite.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is not this Salvation by Works?</P>
<P>Not by the Merit of Works, but by Works as a Condition.</P>
<P N="5">5. The grand Objection to one of the preceed|ing Propo&s;itions, is drawn from Matter of Fact. God does in Fact ju&s;tify tho&s;e who by their own Confe&s;&s;ion neither feared God, nor wrought Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. Is this an Exception to the general Rule?</P>
<P>It is a Doubt whether God makes any Exception at all. But how are we &s;ure that the Per&s;on in que&s;tion never did fear God, and work Righteou&s;|ne&s;s?</P>
<P>His own thinking &s;o, is no Proof. For we know how all that are convinced of &s;in, undervalue them|&s;elves in every Re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="6">6. Does not talking without proper Caution of a ju&s;tified or &s;anctified State, tend to mi&s;lead Men? Almo&s;t naturally leading them to tru&s;t in what was done in one Moment?

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXII.</HI> On Perfection.</HEAD>
<P>LET us &s;trongly and explicitly exhort all Be|lievers to go on to Perfection. That we may all &s;peak the &s;ame Thing, we a&s;k once for all, Shall we defend this Perfection, or give it up? We all agree to defend it, meaning thereby (as we did from the Beginning) Salvation from all Sin, by the Love of God and Man filling our Heart. The Papi&s;ts &s;ay, "This cannot be attained till we have been refined by the Fire of Purgatory." Some Profe&s;&s;ors &s;ay, "Nay, it will be attained as &s;oon as the Soul and Body part." Others &s;ay, "It may be attained before we die: A Moment after is too late." Is it &s;o, or not? We are all agreed, we may be &s;aved from all Sin before Death. The Sub&s;tance then is &s;ettled. But as to the Circum&s;tances, is the Change gradual or in&s;tantaneous! It is both the one and the other. "But &s;hould we in Preaching in&s;i&s;t both on one and the other?" Certainly we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on the gradual Change; and that ear|ne&s;tly and continually. And are there not Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on the in&s;tantaneous al&s;o? If there be &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed Change before Death, &s;hould

we not encourage all Believers to expect it? And the rather, becau&s;e con&s;tant Experience &s;hews, the more earne&s;tly they expect this, the more &s;wiftly and &s;teadily does the gradual Work of God go on in their Souls; the more careful are they to grow in Grace; the more zealous of good Works, and the more punctual in their Attendance on all the Ordinances of God; (whereas ju&s;t the contrary Effects are ob&s;erved, whenever this Expectation cea&s;es.) They are &s;aved by Hope, by this Hope of a total Change, with a gradually increa&s;ing Sal|vation. De&s;troy this Hope, and that Salvation &s;tands &s;till, or rather decrea&s;es daily.

<PB N="33" REF="020522_0032_0FAF3A72DB526A50" MS="y">
very &s;uperficial among us. We can but ju&s;t touch on a few Generals. How little Faith is there among us? How little Communion with God? How little living in Heaven, walking in Eternity, Deadne&s;s to every Creature? How much Love of the World? De&s;ire of Plea&s;ure, of Ea&s;e, of getting Money? How little brotherly Love? What continual Judg|ing one another? What Go&s;&s;ipping, Evil-&s;peaking. Tale-bearing? What Want of moral Hone&s;ty? To in&s;tance only one Particular; Who does as he would be done by, in buying and &s;elling?</P>
<P N="2">2. Family-Religion is wanting in many Branches. And what avails Public Preaching alone, though we could preach like Angels? We mu&s;t, yea, every Travelling-Preacher mu&s;t in&s;truct them from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e. Till this is done, and that in good Ear|ne&s;t, the Methodi&s;ts will be little better than other People.</P>
<P>Our Religion is not deep, univer&s;al, uniform; but &s;uperficial, partial, uneven. It will be &s;o, till we &s;pend half as much Time in this Vi&s;iting, as we now do in talking u&s;ele&s;sly. Can we find a better Method of doing this than Mr. Baxter's? If not, let us adopt it without Delay. His whole Tract, intitled, <HI>Gildas Salvianus,</HI> is well worth a careful Peru&s;al. Speaking of this vi&s;iting from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, he &s;ays, (p. 351.)</P>
<P>"We &s;hall find many Hindrances, both in our|&s;elves and the People.</P>
<P N="1">1. In our&s;elves, there is much Dulne&s;s and Lazi|ne&s;s, &s;o that there will be much ado to get us to be faithful in the Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have a ba&s;e, man-plea&s;ing Temper, &s;o that we let Men peri&s;h, rather than lo&s;e their Love; we let them go quietly to Hell, le&s;t we &s;hould offend them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="020522_0033_0FAF3A739B336CB8">Some of us have al&s;o a fooli&s;h Ba&s;hfulne&s;s. We know not how to begin, and blu&s;h to contradict the Devil.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the greate&s;t Hindrance is Weakne&s;s of Faith. Our whole Motion is weak, becau&s;e the Spring of it is weak.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, we are un&s;kilful in the Work. How few know how to deal with Men, &s;o as to get within them, and &s;uit all our Di&s;cour&s;e to their &s;e|veral Conditions and Tempers: To chu&s;e the fitte&s;t Subjects, and follow them with a holy Mixture of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Terror, and Love, and Meekne&s;s?</P>
<P>But undoubtedly this private Application is im|plied in tho&s;e &s;olemn Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I charge thee before God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the Quick and Dead at his appearing, preach the Word, be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, out of Sea&s;on: Re|prove, rebuke, exhort, with all Long-&s;uffering.</HI></P>
<P>O Brethren, if we could but &s;et this Work on foot in all our Societies, and pro&s;ecute it zealou&s;ly, what Glory would redound to God. If the common Lukewarmne&s;s were bani&s;hed, and every Shop, and every Hou&s;e bu&s;ied in &s;peaking of the Words and Works of God; &s;urely God would dwell in our Habitations, and make us His Delight.</P>
<P>And this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of our People, &s;ome of whom neither believe nor re|pent to this Day. Look round and &s;ee how many of them are &s;till in apparent Danger of Damnation. And how can you walk, and talk, and be merry with &s;uch People, when you know their Ca&s;e? Methinks when you look them in the Face, you &s;hould break forth into Tears, as the Prophet did when he looked upon Hazael, and then &s;et on them with the mo&s;t vehement Exhortations. O, for God's Sake, and the Sake of poor Souls, be&s;tir

your&s;elves, and &s;pare no Pains that may conduce to their Salvation!</P>
<P>What Cau&s;e have we to bleed before the Lord this Day, that we have &s;o long neglected this good Work! If we had but engaged in it &s;ooner, how many more might have been brought to Chri&s;t? And how much holier and happier might we have made our Societies before now? And why might we not have done it &s;ooner? There are many Hin|drances: And &s;o there always will be. But the greate&s;t Hindrance was in our&s;elves, in our Little|ne&s;s of Faith and Love.</P>
<P>But it is objected, 1. This will take up &s;o much Time, we &s;hall not have Lei&s;ure to follow our Studies.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">taining Knowledge is a good Thing, but &s;aving Souls is a better. 2. By this very Thing you will gain the mo&s;t excellent Know|ledge, that of God and Eternity. 3. You will have Time for gaining other Knowledge too. Only &s;leep not more than you need; and never be idle or triflingly employed. But, 4. If you can do but one, let your Studies alone. I would throw by all the Libraries in the World rather than be guilty of the Lo&s;s of one Soul.</P>
<P>It is objected, II. "The People will not &s;ub|mit to it." If &s;ome will not, others will. And the Succe&s;s with them, will repay all your Labour. O let us herein follow the Example of St. Paul. 1. For our general Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Serving the Lord with all Humility of Mind:</HI> 2. Our &s;pecial Work, <HI>Take Heed to your&s;elves and to all the Flock:</HI> 3. Our Doc|trine, <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> 4.

<P>Write this upon your Hearts, and it will do you more good than twenty Year's Study. Then you will have no Time to &s;pare: You will have Work enough. Then likewi&s;e no Preacher will &s;tay with us who is as Salt that has lo&s;t its Savour. For to &s;uch this Employment would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Drudgery. And in order to it, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> need of all the Knowledge you can procure.</P>
<P>The Sum is, Go into every Hou&s;e in cour&s;e, and teach every one therein, young and old, if they belong to us, to be Chri&s;tians inwardly and out|wardly Make every Particular plain to their Un|der&s;tandings; fix it in their Minds; write it on their Hearts. In order to this, there mu&s;t be Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept. What Patience, what Love, what Knowledge is requi&s;ite for this? We mu&s;t needs do this, were it only to avoid Idle|ne&s;s. Do we not loiter away many Hours in every Week? Each try him&s;elf: No Idlene&s;s is con&s;i&s;tent with Growth in Grace. Nay, without Exactne&s;s in redeeming Time, you cannot retain the Grace you received in Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. Why are we not more holy, why do not we live in Eternity? Walk with God all the Day long? Why are we not all devoted to God? Breathing the whole Spirit of Mi&s;&s;ionaries?</P>

<P>AS a College has been erected with the Appro|bation of the Conference, for the Benefit of the Connection; and as the whole Direction of the Seminary ultimately re&s;ts with the Conference; we are determined to &s;upport it under &s;uch Regula|tions as the Conference from Time to Time &s;hall order, concerning its literary, temporal and &s;piritual Intere&s;ts: And therefore the Coun&s;els, the Autho|rity and the Aid of the Conference are earne&s;tly reque&s;ted for the Support of the In&s;titution; that the nece&s;&s;ary Collections may be rai&s;ed, the De&s;ign of the Seminary be fully explained and &s;trongly re|commended to the People, and all the Objections which any of our mi&s;taken Friends may entertain, be fully an&s;wered.</P>
