<HEAD>Liberty of Speech and of the Pre&s;s, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t importance to a free people, that the ju&s;t limits of their rights be well a&s;certained and pre&s;erved: for liberty without limit is licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the wor&s;t kind of tyranny, a tyranny of all. To pre&s;erve our&s;elves again&s;t this, and maintain true liberty, a line mu&s;t be drawn between the rights of each; &s;o well marked, as that it be known by all, and &s;o well guarded, as that it cannot be pa&s;&s;ed by any with im|punity. Thus every man will be free; for every man may exerci&s;e his rights to the extent of their ju&s;t limits, and cannot go beyond tho&s;e limits and encroach on the rights of others. My right to enjoy implies that no man &s;hall di&s;turb my enjoyment. And it is no re&s;traint on my liberty, that in the exerci&s;e of my rights, I am re&s;trained from infringing the rights of others. The rule is <HI>So u&s;e your own rights as not to injure tho&s;e of others.</HI> Inva&s;ion of the rights of others is tyranny, and if this inva&s;ion may be made by every one, it is tyranny of the wor&s;t kind, for in proportion to the number of oppre&s;&s;ors will be the de&s;ire and opportunity of oppre&s;&s;ion. The true friend of liberty, therefore, is he who will &s;et &s;uch &s;trong limits round the rights of every man, that, in the exerci&s;e of them, no man can interrupt the rights of any other. And they are not friends of liberty, but promoters of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, tyranny, and oppre&s;&s;ion, who contend, that every man ought to have an unlimited exerci&s;e of his own rights, without any regard to the rights of others. I can have no right to injure the rights of another; and if I claim this, I am a tyrant and oppre&s;&s;or.</P>

Reputation, character, good name or opinion is a kind of property or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which every man, who has ho|ne&s;tly acquired it, has a right to enjoy
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Penn. Con&s;t. Art. ix. Sec.</HI> 11.&mdash;</NOTE>. Like any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or property, it cannot be taken away from us, but by our own acts. The man who invades the reputa|tion invades the right of another. And not only individuals, but more e&s;pecially men in public &s;tation, branches or departments of the government, the whole admini&s;tration, and the principles, con&s;titution, or &s;y&s;tem of government, and the principles or &s;y&s;tem of public religion and morals, have a right, for the &s;ake of the benefits we receive from them, to reputation, good name and opinion; and the inva|&s;ion of the reputation of either of tho&s;e is an inva&s;ion of right, a le&s;&s;ening of our comfort, and motives to duty.</P>
<P>But Man is indued with faculties of communicating &s;entiments, of inve&s;tigating principles, and of forming opinions and judgments. The exerci&s;e of tho&s;e faculties is a &s;ource of plea&s;ure and in&s;truction. A knowledge, and a ju&s;t judgment of principles, of facts, and of characters, may be u&s;eful for the improvement of our minds, and the regulation of our conduct. The exerci&s;e of tho&s;e faculties of opinion, rea&s;oning, judgment, and communication is part of our natural rights
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib. Sec.</HI> 7.</NOTE>. But the principles of liberty re|quire, that this right, like all our other rights, be limited, &s;o that it never infringe the right of reputation. It mu&s;t not repre&s;ent a &s;olemn truth or exerci&s;e of religion, as fal&s;e or ridiculous, an e&s;tabli&s;hed and u&s;eful principle or form of our government, as odious and dete&s;table; a regular and &s;alu|tary act or motive of the admini&s;tration as unlawful, per|nicious, or di&s;hone&s;t; or an upright man as corrupt. For this would be exerci&s;ing our right of opinion or communi|cation, &s;o as to infringe the right of reputation, and be violating the principles of liberty and natural right.</P>
<P>The principles of liberty, therefore, the rights of Man, require, that our right of communicating information, as to facts and opinions, be &s;o re&s;trained, as not to infringe the right of reputation. Unle&s;s it be &s;o re&s;trained, there is no
<PB N="7" REF="033267_0005_0FF6B1FF706C8BA0">liberty; for there is no ju&s;t enjoyment of our rights. And if every man's right of communication be unre&s;trained, every man's right of reputation is unguarded; and there is, in this re&s;pect, univer&s;al licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and each man is at the mercy of every man; the mo&s;t precarious and oppre&s;&s;ive of all &s;tates. Therefore the free&s;t governments, which have the mo&s;t regarded and cultivated the principles of liberty, as they have &s;o de&s;cribed and limited other rights, that none &s;hould infringe any other, have been careful &s;o to define and limit the rights of reputation, and of communication of &s;entiments, that the right of either &s;hould not infringe that of the other.</P>
<P>We communicate our &s;entiments by words &s;poken, writ|ten, or printed, or by pictures or other &s;igns. The re&s;traints laid on the exerci&s;e of this right, &s;o as it may not infringe the right of reputation, differ, according to the way in which the right of communication is exerci&s;ed. If the right of reputation of a private citizen be infringed by words &s;poken, no indictment will lie for this injury, which is only a ground for a civil action to recover damages.&mdash;<HI>"In foro con&s;cientiae,"</HI> &s;ays a learned Author, before the tri|bunal of con&s;cience, "it is no excu&s;e, that the &s;landerous words are true; for if a man have been guilty of any thing, which the law prohibits, he is liable to an&s;wer for it, in a legal way; but it can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e for a private per&s;on to accu&s;e him thereof; there is a degree of cruelty in &s;o doing, and it mu&s;t create ill blood. Yet the law does, in compa&s;&s;ion to man's infirmities, allow it to be a ju&s;tification in an action for words &s;poken, that they are true
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Bac. Abr.</HI> 480.&mdash;</NOTE>." But when &s;landerous words are &s;poken of the con&s;titution, or admini&s;tration, or any of its acts or officers, they are ground for an indictment; as a mi&s;demeanor, or breach of the duty of a citizen
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib.</HI></NOTE>. The rea&s;on of this is evident: for, as for an injury affecting an individual, the remedy is by action, &s;o for an injury affecting the public, the remedy is by indictment.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Libels, or &s;lander expre&s;&s;ed by words
<PB N="8" REF="033267_0006_0FF6B26373D925C8">written or printed, or by pictures or other &s;igns, and in|fringing the right of reputation; "they have," &s;ays the &s;ame Author, "at all times, and with good rea&s;on, been puni&s;hed in a more exemplary manner than &s;landerous words: for having a greater tendency to provoke men to breaches of the peace, quarrels, and murders, they are of much more dangerous con&s;equence to &s;ociety. Words which are fre|quently the effect of a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion may &s;oon be buried in oblivion. But Libels, be&s;ides that the Author is actuated by more deliberate malice, are for the mo&s;t part &s;o la&s;ting, as to be &s;carce ever forgiven."
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib.</HI>&mdash;</NOTE> For this rea&s;on, a libel affecting the reputation of even a private citizen, is re&s;trained by being con&s;idered as a public of|fence, and &s;ubject to an indictment. But whether, on the trial of &s;uch indictment, the truth of the libel may be given in evidence, will depend on the nature of the libel.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone defines libels, "taken in their large&s;t &s;en&s;e, to be writings, pictures or the like of an immoral or illegal tendency, and in a more particular &s;en&s;e, any malicious defamations of any per&s;on, and e&s;pecially a ma|gi&s;trate, made public by either printing, writing, &s;igns, or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath or expo&s;e him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule. It is immaterial, with re&s;pect to the e&s;&s;ence of a libel, whether the matter of it be true or fal&s;e; &s;ince the provocation, and not the fal&s;ity, is the thing to be puni&s;hed criminally. Therefore in a criminal pro&s;ecution, the tendency, which all libels have to create animo&s;ities, and to di&s;turb the public peace, is the whole that the law con&s;iders
<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Comm.</HI> 150, 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of our &s;tate provides "That the Printing pre&s;ses &s;hall be free to every per&s;on who under|takes to examine the proceedings of the legi&s;lature, or any branch of government: and no law &s;hall ever be made to re&s;train the right thereof. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely &s;peak, write, and print in any &s;ubject, being re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of that
<PB N="9" REF="033267_0007_0FF6B2652B78EFD0">liberty. In pro&s;ecutions for the publication of papers inve&s;|tigating the official conduct of officers, or men in a public capacity, or where the matter publi&s;hed is proper for public information, the truth thereof may be given in evidence.&mdash; And in all indictments for libels, the jury &s;hall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the court, as in other ca&s;es."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;t. Art. ix. Sec.</HI> 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this &s;tatement of the law re&s;pecting libels, the following deductions &s;eem evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. This right of free communication of thoughts and opinions is, like all other rights, limited by re&s;pon&s;ibility for its abu&s;e; and laws to puni&s;h its abu&s;e, are not, in a con|&s;titutional or ju&s;t &s;en&s;e, re&s;traints on the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. The general rule is, that, in indictments for libels, truth cannot be given in evidence.</P>
<P N="3">3. This rule is excluded only from the ca&s;es mentioned in this &s;ection of the con&s;titution, and remains yet applica|ble to all other ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is only in &s;o far as the paper charged as a libel in|ve&s;tigates the official conduct of officers, or men in a public capacity, or where the matter publi&s;hed is proper for public information, that the truth thereof can be given in evidence. In all other ca&s;es, truth is no ju&s;tification; for it is the provocation which con&s;titutes the offence.</P>
<P N="5">5. As grand juries hear evidence only in behalf of the pro&s;ecution, and in indictments for libels, as in other ca&s;es, the jury determine the law and the facts under the direction of the court (that is, conforming to this direction in point of law, have a right to give a general verdict) the grand jury, generally &s;peaking, cannot a&s;certain whether the libellous matter be true or not; but, if the making or publi&s;hing of the libel be proved, they will find the bill, and on the trial before the traver&s;e jury, the court will direct, whether evidence of the truth be admi&s;&s;ible or not, and whether the matter be libellous or not; and, under the direction of the court, the traver&s;e jury will determine the law and the facts. If a traver&s;e jury &s;hould determine that
<PB N="10" REF="033267_0008_0FF6B202A0A07678">a paper is a libel, which is not, and convict a man who has committed no offence, the court has a control over their verdict, by granting a new trial, or arre&s;ting judgment. But if the jury determine that a libel is no libel, and acquit a man really guilty of an offence, the court has no control over this verdict: for a man acquitted of a criminal charge, can never be tried again on the &s;ame charge.</P>
<P>Such &s;eems to be the &s;tate of the right of communication of thoughts and opinions, according to the law of Penn&s;yl|vania. Any thing may be &s;poken, in terms of decency proper to the &s;ubject, of the government, an officer, or an individual, provided the &s;peaker can prove it to be true. But all truths are not u&s;eful or proper for publication, therefore all truths are not to be written, printed, and &s;o uttered or publi&s;hed. And therefore, except in the ca&s;e of papers inve&s;tigating the official conduct of officers, or men in a public capacity, or where the matter publi&s;hed is proper for public information, if any man write, print, utter, or publi&s;h a libel, he may be indicted, convicted, and puni&s;hed, whether the libellous matter be true or not.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in its la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, has pa&s;&s;ed a law
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">14 <HI>July,</HI> 1798.</NOTE>, enacting, that if any per&s;ons &s;hall unlawfully combine together, with intent to oppo&s;e any mea&s;ure of the government of the United States, or impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to prevent any per&s;on holding any office under the government of the United States from perform|ing his duty; or &s;hall, with &s;uch intent, advi&s;e or attempt to procure any in&s;urrection, riot, unlawful a&s;&s;embly or combination; they &s;hall be deemed guilty of a high mi&s;de|meanor, and be puni&s;hed by a fine, not exceeding five thou&s;and dollars, and by impri&s;onment, for not le&s;s than &s;ix months, nor more than five years; and may further be holden to &s;ureties for good behaviour. And it further enacts, that if any per&s;on &s;hall write, print, utter or publi&s;h, or &s;hall cau&s;e or procure to be written, printed, uttered, or publi&s;hed, or &s;hall knowingly and willingly aid in writing, printing, uttering, or publi&s;hing, any fal&s;e, &s;candalous,
<PB N="11" REF="033267_0009_0FF6B204D4D47948">and malicious writing again&s;t the government of the U|nited States, or either Hou&s;e of Congre&s;s, or the Pre&s;ident of the United States, with intent to defame the &s;aid govern|ment, or either Hou&s;e of Congre&s;s, or the Pre&s;ident, or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or di&s;repute; or to excite again&s;t them or either of them, the hatred of the people of the United States; or to excite unlawful combinations therein, for oppo&s;ing or re&s;i&s;ting any law of the United States, or any act of the Pre&s;ident of the United States done in pur&s;uance of any &s;uch law, or of the powers ve&s;ted in him by the con&s;titution of the United States; or to oppo&s;e or defeat any &s;uch law or acts; or to aid, encourage, or abet any ho&s;tile de&s;igns of any foreign nation again&s;t the United States, their people, or govern|ment; &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall be puni&s;hed by a fine, not exceed|ing two thou&s;and dollars, and impri&s;onment, not exceeding two years.</P>
<P>This act, which &s;eems to be be&s;t known by the name of <HI>the Sedition Bill,</HI> provides, "That if any per&s;on &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted under it, for writing or publi&s;hing any libel, it &s;hall be lawful for him, on the trial of the cau&s;e, to give in evidence, in his defence, the truth of the matter con|tained in the publication charged as a libel. And the jury who &s;hall try the cau&s;e &s;hall have a right to determine the law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other ca&s;es." This clau&s;e, clearly borrowed from the &s;ec|tion already quoted of the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, confirms, &s;o far as concurrent expre&s;&s;ions of different per|&s;ons on the &s;ame &s;ubject can, the con&s;truction which I put on that &s;ection, that the time for giving in evidence the truth of the libellous matter is at the trial of the cau&s;e by the traver&s;e jury.</P>
<P>No law &s;eems to have been re&s;i&s;ted in Congre&s;s with more vehemence and pa&s;&s;ion, by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed all the mea&s;ures adopted as mea&s;ures of defence again&s;t the ho&s;|tile &s;pirit of France. And, out of doors, it has been attacked with &s;ullen rancour, as a death-wound to the pro|gre&s;s of that dete&s;table &s;y&s;tem of &s;lander, which has been
<PB N="12" REF="033267_0010_0FF6B2676BCD16C8">pur&s;ued, with &s;uch malignant indu&s;try, and calamitous &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t every mea&s;ure of the admini&s;tration. And yet, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, this law does not create any new offence; for every thing forbidden by it appears to me to have been, before, an offence at common law. The combinations and attempts therein forbidden are mi&s;demea|nors. Any writing of an immoral or illegal tendency is a libel
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Comm.</HI> 150.</NOTE>. And &s;landerous words &s;poken of the government, or its acts or authority, are puni&s;hable by indictment
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Bac.</HI> 480.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid then, why was this law made? Several rea&s;ons may be given for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is no uncommon thing for a legi&s;lature to make an act declaratory of the common law. At this time, it was peculiarly proper to make &s;uch an act, as a &s;olemn admo|nition to wicked or unthinking men to ab&s;tain from prac|tices, which &s;pread &s;landers and fal&s;ehood, foment divi&s;ions and &s;editions among the citizens, weaken the energy of the government, and, thus rendering the nation defencele&s;s, encourage France, by a pro&s;pect of impunity and &s;ucce&s;s, to mea&s;ures of aggre&s;&s;ion and ho&s;tility.</P>
<P N="2">2. A doubt had been &s;ugge&s;ted whether the courts of the United States had cognizance of any offences not expre&s;sly declared by the con&s;titution, or &s;ome law, or treaty of the United States.&mdash;I do not think this doubt well founded. The judicial power of the United States extends to all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution, the laws, and treaties of the United States
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Con&s;t. Art. iii. Sec. z:</HI></NOTE>. Hence re&s;ults a juri&s;diction to try and puni&s;h, as mi&s;demeanors, all acts tending to violate or wea|ken the authority of the con&s;titution, or of any act or mea&s;ure of the government of the United States. For it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch mi&s;demeanors &s;hould pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, or that the government of the United States &s;hould be obliged to beg protection from the individual &s;tates. The doubt however exi&s;ting, it might be thought proper to remove it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It might be thought proper to pa&s;s this law, in order to limit the extent of puni&s;hment which might be inflicted
<PB N="13" REF="033267_0011_0FF6B206C3BDA058">on the offender; and to give him the advantage of proving the truth of the libel in his defence.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the motive for making this law, it was oppo&s;ed on two grounds: 1, as uncon&s;titutional, and, 2, as inexpedient.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was &s;aid to be uncon&s;titutional, becau&s;e the con|&s;titution declares, that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the con&s;titution, nor prohibited by it to the &s;tates, are re&s;erved to the &s;tates re&s;pectively, or to the people;"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>U. S. Con&s;t add. Art.</HI> xii.</NOTE> and more expre&s;sly, that "Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law abridging the freedom of &s;peech or of the pre&s;s.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ib. Art.</HI> iii.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, like every other in&s;trument, mu&s;t be con&s;trued by taking the whole together. Among the pow|ers which the con&s;titution delegates to Congre&s;s is a power "to make all laws, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution all powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titu|tion in the government of the United States, or any depart|ment or office thereof
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>U. S. Con&s;t. Art.</HI> i. <HI>Sec.</HI> 8.</NOTE>." It is evident, that the attempts and writings declared puni&s;hable by this law, have a direct tendency, differing only in degree from force, to prevent or ob&s;truct the execution of the powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;ti|tution in the government of the United States. Therefore a law, declaring that &s;uch attempts and writings are puni&s;h|able, is con&s;titutional as nece&s;&s;ary and proper for the exe|cution of the powers of government.</P>
<P>If the clau&s;e of the con&s;titution which prohibits Congre&s;s from making any law abridging the freedom of &s;peech or of the pre&s;s, is to be con&s;trued as prohibiting Congre&s;s from making any law declaring libels again&s;t the government, acts, or mea&s;ures of the United States, to be puni&s;hable; then by the &s;ame con&s;truction of the con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania, which declares, that no law &s;hall ever be made to re&s;train this right, the mo&s;t fal&s;e and malicious libels might be publi&s;hed, again&s;t the government, acts, or mea&s;ures of this &s;tate (and of cour&s;e of the United States) and the A&s;|&s;embly would have no power to make any law, declaring
<PB N="14" REF="033267_0012_0FF6B269D3224508">&s;uch libels puni&s;hable; and thus ab&s;olute impunity for them would be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is a con&s;tructon too ab&s;urd to be received as true. Nor will it ju&s;tify &s;uch con&s;truc|tion of the con&s;titution of the United States to &s;ay, that it was intended by that con&s;titution, that the authority of pa&s;&s;ing laws again&s;t libels &s;hould be left to the individual &s;tates: for this would be &s;uppo&s;ing that the government of the United States mu&s;t, unle&s;s the individual &s;tates choo&s;e to afford it, be without defence again&s;t the mo&s;t dangerous enemy that can attack it, &s;lander; again&s;t which, if unre|&s;trained, no government can &s;upport it&s;elf. This, there|fore, would only remove one ab&s;urdity by another, and &s;ome other con&s;truction of this clau&s;e of the con&s;titution mu&s;t be &s;ought for.</P>
<P>When the pre&s;s was abu&s;ed by being made a vehicle of flander, governments laid re&s;traints on it. Books were to be printed only in certain places, only of a certain nature, and only by licen&s;e of certain per&s;ons. In England, the&s;e re&s;trictions were impo&s;ed fir&s;t by the authority of the King, part of who&s;e prerogative the regulation of printing was con&s;idered; then by the Star-Chamber, an organ of exe|cutive authority; and in the time of the Commonwealth, and after the Re&s;toration, and after the Revolution, by the Parliament. The law re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s expiring in 1694, was not renewed, and the pre&s;s became free.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume's England. App. James i, vol.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 318&mdash;4 <HI>Comm.</HI> 151, 2.</NOTE> For freedom of the pre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this, that any man may, without the con&s;ent of any other, print any book or writing whatever; being, in this, as in all other freedom of action, liable to puni&s;hment, if he injure an individual or the public.</P>
<P>For thus under&s;tanding the liberty of the pre&s;s, I &s;hall quote the re&s;pectable authority of Sir William Black&s;tone. "Where bla&s;phemous, immoral, trea&s;onable, &s;chi&s;matical, &s;editious, or &s;candalous libels are puni&s;hed, the <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s,</HI> properly under&s;tood, is by no means infringed or violated. The liberty of the pre&s;s is indeed e&s;&s;ential to the nature of a free &s;tate: but this con&s;i&s;ts in laying no <HI>previous</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="033267_0013_0FF6B26C07C8AD00">re&s;traints upon publications, and not in freedom from con|&s;ure for criminal matter when publi&s;hed. Every free man has an undoubted right to lay what &s;entiments he plea&s;es before the public: to forbid this is to de&s;troy the freedom of the pre&s;s: but if he publi&s;hes what is improper, mi&s;|chievous or illegal, he mu&s;t take the con&s;equence of his own temerity. To &s;ubject the pre&s;s to the re&s;trictive power of a licen&s;er, as was formerly done, is to &s;ubject all freedom of &s;entiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion and government. But to puni&s;h any dangerous or offen&s;ive writing, which, when publi&s;hed, &s;hall, on a fair and impartial trial, be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the only &s;olid foundation of civil liberty. Thus the will of individuals is &s;till left free; the abu&s;e only of that free will is the &s;ub|ject of legal puni&s;hment.&mdash;Neither is any re&s;traint hereby laid upon freedom of thought or inquiry: liberty of private &s;entiment is &s;till left; the di&s;&s;eminating or making public of bad &s;entiments, de&s;tructive of the ends of &s;ociety, is the crime which &s;ociety corrects. A man may be allowed to keep poi&s;ons in his clo&s;et, but not publicly to vend them as cer|dials.&mdash;And the only plau&s;ible argument heretofore u&s;ed for the re&s;training of the freedom of the pre&s;s, <HI>that it was nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent the daily abu&s;e of it,</HI> will entirely lo&s;e its force, when it is &s;hewn (by a &s;ea&s;onable exertion of the laws) that the pre&s;s cannot be abu&s;ed to any bad purpo&s;e, without in|curring a &s;uitable puni&s;hment. So true will it be found, that to cen&s;ure the licentiou&s;ne&s;s is to maintain the liberty of the pre&s;s
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Comm.</HI> 151 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the liberty of the pre&s;s which the people of the &s;tates of America, for its greater &s;ecurity, have made part of their fundamental law. In their &s;tate con&s;titutions, they provided, that their legi&s;latures &s;hould not make any law re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s, that is, &s;hould lay no <HI>previous</HI> re&s;traints on the pre&s;s; or as the Penn&s;ylvania
<PB N="16" REF="033267_0014_0FF6B26E39E2E0D0">con&s;titution expre&s;&s;es it, that "every citizen may freely &s;peak, write, and print, on any &s;ubject, <HI>being re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of that liberty</HI>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art.</HI> ix. <HI>Sect.</HI> 7.</NOTE>." The &s;ame principle was after|wards adopted into the Federal con&s;titution; and the &s;ection e&s;tabli&s;hing it there is to be con&s;trued in the &s;ame manner. So that the liberty of the pre&s;s is preci&s;ely as &s;tated by Sir William Black&s;tone, its being free from all previous re|&s;traints, but, as all other rights or liberties are, &s;ubject to correction for abu&s;e.&mdash;On this liberty of the pre&s;s in En|gland, Parliament may, at any time, impo&s;e previous re|&s;traints; but here a con&s;titutional provi&s;ion puts it out of the power of any legi&s;lature to do &s;o.</P>
<P>This law then is no abridgement of the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s, and is therefore no infringement of the con&s;titution. So far from this, that, as it makes no new offence, it is no alteration of the criminal code, only as it enlarges the bounds of defence, limits the puni&s;hment, and (if this be an alteration) gives expre&s;s jurisdiction to the federal courts. It is not injurious either to the con&s;titution, or to the liberty of the pre&s;s, but is intended and adapted for the &s;upport of both: for it cannot be too often repeated, that "to cen&s;ure the licentiou&s;ne&s;s is to maintain the liberty of the pre&s;s."</P>
<P>To re&s;train the abu&s;e of my right, or &s;uch an exerci&s;e of it as &s;hall encroach on a right of another, is no re&s;traint or abridgement of my right: for I can have no right to le&s;|&s;en the right of another. And to claim &s;uch an unlimited u&s;e of my right, as to encroach on the right of another is to claim, not liberty, but tyranny; not right, but oppre&s;&s;ion. "I may freely &s;peak, write, and print, on any &s;ubject;" but "I am re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of this liberty." Unle&s;s I may &s;peak, write, and print, my right will not be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured; and unle&s;s I be re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of this liberty, the rights of others would not be &s;ufficiently &s;ecur|ed. Therefore to &s;ecure all, and e&s;tabli&s;h true liberty, I mu&s;t be free to &s;peak, write, and print, but be al&s;o re&s;pon|&s;ible for the abu&s;e of that liberty. This is a &s;ound princi|ple,
<PB N="17" REF="033267_0015_0FF6B255CC172B48">and applies to all rights whatever.&mdash;It applies to our right of action, as well as to our right of expre&s;&s;ing our &s;entiments in every way. I may ride a hor&s;e, but I mu&s;t not ride over a man. I may walk where I plea&s;e, but not on my neighbour's garden. I may u&s;e my cane, but not to &s;trike any man I meet. Such is the liberty of &s;peech or of the pre&s;s. A law that any printing pre&s;s &s;hould be locked up, and the key kept by a certain officer, or that no book &s;hould be printed without permi&s;&s;ion from a certain officer, would be a law abridging the liberty of the pre&s;s. A law, that a man &s;hould not &s;peak without permi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould &s;peak only on certain &s;ubjects, or &s;hould have a gag put in his mouth, not to be taken out but by a certain officer, would be an abridgement of the freedom of &s;peech, would be indeed a <HI>gagging-law.</HI> But becau&s;e the con&s;tituti|on denies the legi&s;lature any power to make a law like this, or to make any law laying a <HI>previous</HI> re&s;traint on &s;peech or the pre&s;s, to claim therefore a right, from the con&s;titution, to &s;peak, write, or print &s;edition, impiety, bla&s;phemy, or any fal&s;ehood, however gro&s;s, indecent, and dangerous, is claiming not liberty but licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Will any one &s;ay, that my right of freedom of &s;peech entitles me to propagate with impunity any &s;lander I plea&s;e upon all my neighbours? What character would be &s;afe, and what life would be free from mi&s;ery, were this liberty of &s;peech to be indulged? There is no &s;uch liberty. A liberty to de&s;troy reputation would be as inju&s;t, as a liberty to de|&s;troy life. Every man is free to &s;peak, but he &s;peaks at his peril, and is an&s;werable for all he &s;ays, if it tend to the in|jury of another. It is not his opinion of its being proper or true, that will ju&s;tify him.&mdash;When he utters it, he is an&s;werable for its truth and propriety; and the opinion of a court and jury, not his opinion mu&s;t decide on its truth and propriety. Every repeater of the tale is, in like manner an&s;werable as the author. So of libels or written or printed &s;lander, with this difference, that, as the provocation by them is more dangerous, they are le&s;s indulged; and, except in the ca&s;e of matters proper for public information, the proceedings of government, and the official conduct of
<PB N="18" REF="033267_0016_0FF6B27070FF6178">officers, or men in a public capacity, truth is no ju&s;tification. Even in ca&s;es where truth is a ju&s;tification, the truth mu&s;t be made out to the &s;atisfaction of a jury.&mdash;That the libeller may have thought it true, though it may extenuate, will not ju&s;tify the offence: for no man is to be judge in his own cau&s;e, and my opinion will not ju&s;tify me in doing an injury to my neighbour, in his reputation, any more than in his per&s;on or property. Every man, therefore, writes and prints, as he &s;peaks, at his peril; and the publi&s;her of a libel is an&s;werable, in like manner as the author. And both are an&s;werable, as in any other offence, to the judg|ment of a court and jury, by who&s;e opinion, and not of the offender, mu&s;t the guilt or innocence of the action be determined. And &s;uch re&s;triction, if I may &s;o call it, or correction of the abu&s;e, of freedom of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s, is not only perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of civil liberty in general, and with the rules of our con&s;titution: but is nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining the genuine liberty of &s;peech and the pre&s;s. For, of all enemies to liberty, licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s is the greate&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. I think, the expediency of this law can be as clearly &s;hewn, as its con&s;titutionality: and, if &s;o, there will be not only duty, but plea&s;ure in the obedience we yield to it.</P>
<P>Speech, writing, and printing are the great directors of public opinion, and public opinion is the great director of human action. Of &s;uch force is public opinion, that, with it on its &s;ide, the wor&s;t government will &s;upport it&s;elf; and, with it, again&s;t it, the be&s;t government will fall.&mdash; All governments are &s;upported by it; and, without it, can no government be &s;upported. What is the force in the power of any government, compared to that of the people governed by it, if the people choo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t? And will they not choo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t, if their opinions be &s;et again&s;t the government, their pa&s;&s;ions rou&s;ed to enthu&s;ia&s;m, and an opportunity offered for &s;ucce&s;s. And all this may be done by means of clubs, &s;ocieties, and the pre&s;s.&mdash;Give to any &s;et of men the command of the pre&s;s, and you give them the command of the country; for you give them the com|mand of public opinion, which commands every thing. Let
<PB N="19" REF="033267_0017_0FF6B208F13703A8">therefore, clubs, &s;ocieties, and the printing pre&s;&s;es attack any government, however free, and however &s;trong, they will infallibly de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>It will not be pretended that the old government of France was good, nor denied, that it needed reformation; but, in &s;o far as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trength, and as it was &s;upport|ed by the prejudices of the people in its favour, it is a proper in&s;tance of what I have &s;tated. The French revolution was accompli&s;hed by a gradual operation on public opinion. For many years before, the &s;eeds of in|&s;urrection had been bu&s;ily &s;own in the minds of the people. Clubs, and &s;ocieties, under various names and pretexts, were e&s;tabli&s;hed through the kingdom. The printing pre&s;&s;es were occupied. Pamphlets and books were di&s;per&s;ed. New principles were broached, &s;upported, and e&s;tabli&s;hed. Under the &s;anction of philo&s;ophy and rea&s;on, all prejudices in favour of religion and government were gradually &s;ap|ped, to make way for, liberty, equality, and the rights of man; fine words, which, as they were little under&s;tood, were the more admired. All were men; and prie&s;ts and princes were no more. All re&s;pect for office cea&s;ed: and an in&s;ult to a bi&s;hop or a king was no more than an in&s;ult to an equal. Religion was but a &s;tate trick, and its author and mini&s;ters but impo&s;tors. Public opinion, the great pillar of this, as of every other government, being thus withdrawn, the mighty fabric of the monarchy, which, &s;up|ported by public opinion, had &s;tood the bla&s;ts of ages, was touched by a &s;light &s;hock, and, in a moment crumbled to pieces.</P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence? Not &s;atisfied with re|formation, public opinion, directed by clubs and the pre&s;s, was employed to lead the nation to exce&s;s, anarchy, and &s;lavery. The de&s;perate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrants, which hath &s;ince ruled France was &s;upported by public opinion, direc|ted by clubs and the pre&s;s, till it acquired an enormous armed force. When di&s;gu&s;ted by its cruel and unprincipled oppre&s;&s;ion, public opinion began to revolt, and the printing pre&s;&s;es to &s;peak again&s;t it; even this tyranny, with its va&s;t armed force, felt that it could not re&s;i&s;t public opinion, and,
<PB N="20" REF="033267_0018_0FF6B258108B0BE0">to &s;ilence it, &s;hut up the pre&s;&s;es; and now extorts, from an unhappy nation, a &s;ullen and reluctant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by its armed force, and an en&s;laved pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution were &s;own in mo&s;t of the governments of Europe, by the corruption of public opin|ion effected by a combination of clubs and the pre&s;s. Many have fallen &s;acrifices. And nothing but the dreadful exam|ple, which the French revolution furni&s;hed, of the fatal danger of &s;ub&s;tituting ab&s;tract principles in&s;tead of the maxims of experience, could have pre&s;erved many other governments.</P>
<P>One would have thought, that the United States of America, ble&s;t with the be&s;t practicable model of repub|lican liberty, which human wi&s;dom hath yet been able to &s;ugge&s;t, would have e&s;caped this greate&s;t of all plagues, the corruption of public opinion; and that all men would have united in approbation of a &s;y&s;tem of government, which mu&s;t be acknowledged excellent, and of an admini&s;tration, which mu&s;t be acknowledged to have been wi&s;e, enlightened and hone&s;t. Yet, unfortunately, this plague hath reached us al&s;o; and our government has been a&s;&s;ailed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;landers, by many who perhaps believed, and by many who &s;urely could not believe, the &s;landers which they uttered. The tongue, the pen, and the pre&s;s; conver&s;a|tions, letters, e&s;&s;ays, and pamplets, have repre&s;ented our truly republican and balanced con&s;titution as a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny; and our upright and wi&s;e admini&s;tration, as mi&s;|chievous and corrupt. Our wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t public officers have had their lives embittered, and have been driven from their &s;tations by uncea&s;ing and malignant &s;lander. And thus has it been attempted to withdraw, from our excellent government, the only effectual &s;upport of any government, public opinion; and thus to withdraw all reverence from &s;tation and authority, deprive the con&s;titution, the laws, and the admini&s;tration, of all re&s;pect and efficacy, and &s;ur|render the nation a prey to any invader.</P>
<P>France &s;aw our condition, and attacked us: for France attacks a nation only when &s;he has rendered it defencele&s;s, by dividing the people from the government, and withdraw|ing
<PB N="21" REF="033267_0019_0FF6B20B24335D50">from the government the &s;upport of public opinion. In this condition any nation is an ea&s;y prey. To our com|plaints &s;he pretended no ju&s;tification, and replied to our re&s;entment, that &s;he had a party among our&s;elves. She re&s;ted on the influence of clubs and the pre&s;s, and on the devotion to her, which they had produced among us.&mdash; Some of our pre&s;&s;es &s;eem to have been con&s;tantly devoted to her views. Many of our citizens, and of our men in public &s;tations, &s;eem to have favored tho&s;e mea&s;ures, on which France mu&s;t have depended for &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t us.&mdash; And our government was threatened with the lo&s;s of its be&s;t &s;upport, the hearts of its citizens, by means of fal&s;e|hood, mi&s;repre&s;entation, and the vile arts of foreign enemies, and di&s;contented, factious, and &s;editious men. In this &s;itu|ation, in which no government can long &s;tand, and threa|tened with a war from France, was it not the duty of our government, to di&s;arm France of that weapon, by which &s;he could mo&s;t effectually injure us, the power of &s;preading flander and &s;edition again&s;t the government, and alienating from it, its true &s;upport, the affections of its citizens? It was its duty, and it would have been inexcu&s;able, if it had omitted this duty. Without &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;lander and &s;edition again&s;t the government, the &s;upport of public opinion cannot be pre&s;erved to it: and without the &s;upport to it of public opinion, all other defence again&s;t France is vain.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds, it appears evident to me, that this law is not only expedient, but nece&s;&s;ary. And it may be laid down as a general rule, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the corruption of public opinion, or to pre&s;erve any govern|ment again&s;t it; unle&s;s their be laws to correct the licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s. True liberty of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in being free to &s;peak, write, and print, but being, as in the exerci&s;e of all our other liberties, re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of this liberty. And whether we have abu&s;ed this liberty or not, mu&s;t, like all other que&s;tions of right, be left to the deci&s;ion of a court and a jury. This is the univer&s;al te&s;t, by which the exerci&s;e of all our rights mu&s;t be tried. Nor is the &s;ubjection of our right of freedom of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s to this te&s;t, any more a re&s;traint
<PB N="22" REF="033267_0020_0FF6B29B6427B108">on that right; than the &s;ubjection of our rights of life and of property to the &s;ame te&s;t, is a re&s;traint on tho&s;e rights. By this te&s;t mu&s;t the exerci&s;e of all our rights be tried, or no man could enjoy any right whatever. If while our right to life and to property is &s;ubmitted to this re&s;triction, we yet believe we are free, &s;hall we think our liberty infringed, by &s;ubjecting to the &s;ame re&s;triction, our right to &s;peak and print?</P>
<P>This law takes from no man any liberty but a liberty of doing mi&s;chief. And &s;o far is it from being true, that this law is any violation of liberty, that, it may be &s;afely aver|red, without &s;uch laws, for puni&s;hing the abu&s;e of the free|dom of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s, liberty cannot be pre&s;erved: every man will be a &s;lave to the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of every other, truth and ju&s;tice will be bani&s;hed, the authority of government de&s;troyed, and malice, anarchy, confu&s;ion, and every evil work e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Our con&s;titution is excellent, our admini&s;tration is wi&s;e and hone&s;t, and has no intere&s;t &s;eparate from that of the people. On the &s;upport of &s;uch an admini&s;tration of &s;uch a government depends our liberty. But, let me repeat, no admini&s;tration or government can &s;tand again&s;t the corrup|tion of public opinion; and let me therefore &s;olemnly ad|moni&s;h you, as you value the peace and liberty of your&s;elves and your po&s;terity, &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the truth of this. We have &s;een an in&s;urrection promoted by the corruption of public opinion. An inva&s;ion is invited by it.&mdash;How many &s;hocks of this kind our government is doomed to &s;tand, only the Ruler of the world knows. Let us take warning from our own experience, and the fate of other nations. Let all friends to liberty and order unite in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing &s;lander: for, where it prevails, there will be no happine&s;s, no government. Of all &s;landers tho&s;e of the pre&s;s are mo&s;t dangerous. Pre&s;&s;es e&s;tabli&s;hed to run down the government are the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of all trea&s;ons.&mdash;This ought to be well con&s;idered; for every one who encourages &s;uch pre&s;&s;es, or contributes to their &s;upport, is a partner in their guilt. Every one who reads their productions with approbation, &s;ucks in di&s;ea&s;e upon his mind; and every one
<PB N="23" REF="033267_0021_0FF6B29D135D8500">who repeats them to others, &s;preads the infection. What would we think of a &s;et of men, who &s;hould agree to hire a number of per&s;ons to run through the country, and report fal&s;ehoods and &s;landers? Preci&s;ely &s;uch, and more dange|rous, is the guilt of tho&s;e who contribute to the &s;upport of a &s;landerous Pre&s;s. They are wounding their own and their country's peace, and undermining the government.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, <HI>We de&s;ire to hear both &s;ides, that we may know the truth.</HI> My friends, truth has but one &s;ide: and li&s;tening to error and fal&s;ehood is indeed a &s;trange way to di&s;cover truth. Take the repre&s;entations which its friends have made of the conduct of government; have you ever found fal&s;ehood in them? Take the contradictory &s;tatements made by its enemies&mdash;have you ever found truth in them?</P>
<P>You may yet &s;ay, <HI>We have not the means of knowing on which &s;ide the truth lies; and we, therefore, give no pre&s;er|ence to any, but hear all.</HI> What would you think of a Prote&s;tant who &s;hould &s;ay thus? <HI>The Lutherans and Cal|vini&s;ts differ in opinion, the Catholics from both, and the Ma|bometans from them all; I know not on which &s;ide the truth is; I will, therefore, pay a Lutheran mini&s;ter, a Calvini&s;t mini&s;ter, a Catholic prie&s;t, and a Turki&s;h dervis; and then, I &s;hall be &s;ure of knowing the truth.</HI> Would we think that this man had any regard to truth or religion? In&s;tead of acquiring knowledge, would he not confu&s;e his mind, and lo&s;e &s;ight of both truth and duty? As in religion, &s;o in government, a &s;incere enquirer after truth will always find means of di&s;covering it. And it is only their enemies, and hypocritical pretenders to &s;incerity, who, under pretence of &s;earching for truth, wander through the endle&s;s varieties of error, and affect to think, there is no certainty.</P>
<P>There is hardly any part of government, which, as of re|ligion, has not been mi&s;repre&s;ented by its enemies. Now, though of all its parts, the people generally have not had an opportunity of being &s;ully &s;atisfied, yet of &s;ome, they have had this opportunity. And wherever they have had &s;uch opportunity, they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied, that the conduct of government has been right, and the mi&s;repre&s;entations
<PB N="24" REF="033267_0022_0FF6B20DE9F76498">of it fal&s;e and malicious. No part of the conduct of our government has been more mi&s;repre&s;ented, than its conduct with re&s;pect to France. Yet, when fairly &s;tated, in a way that the greate&s;t &s;landerers dare not contradict, how hone&s;t, wi&s;e, and prai&s;e-worthy does it &s;eem! Ought we not there|fore to believe, that, if we under&s;tood all the re&s;t, as well as this part, the whole would appear as unexceptionable? This would be our duty between man and man; and it is el&s;e our duty between citizens and the government.</P>
<P>Another duty, and a mean of information, is to &s;earch at the be&s;t &s;ources of information. You ought never to be|lieve a &s;lander on government, merely becau&s;e it is &s;tated in a newspaper or a pamphlet, or reported by tho&s;e on who&s;e judgment, veracity, and opportunity of knowing, you have not confidence. As if the thing concerned your own hou&s;e or e&s;tate, or the character of your friend, go to tho&s;e in who&s;e veracity and judgment you would confide in matters of the greate&s;t importance. For, be a&s;&s;ured, no matter is of greater importance, than a ju&s;t confidence in government. The men, who endeavour to rob you of this, are the wor&s;t enemies of your peace. If they can &s;ucceed in robbing your minds of this confidence, they rob you of your liberty; for they deprive government of its authority; and government without authority is anarchy; and anarchy is the wor&s;t tyranny. No crime, therefore, is greater, than that &s;lander, which, dimini&s;hing the people's confidence in the government, dimini&s;hes their &s;ecurity, and de&s;troys their liberty. And no crime more de&s;erves the vigilant and &s;evere animadver&s;ion of a Grand Jury.</P>
