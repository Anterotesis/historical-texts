<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the extraordinary phaenomena which di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ent mo&s;t &s;ingular period, there is none more remarkable than the &s;triking re&s;emblance which it bears in many points to that of the reformation. When the u&s;urpations of the Roman Pontiffs grew intolerable to princes and to nations, when virtue and morality were trampled under the feet of depraved and aban|doned clergy, when honor, property, and even exi&s;tence lay at the mercy of an infamous prie&s;thood, God graciou&s;ly re&s;cued mankind by permitting them to di&s;cover the Art of Printing. Truth needs but to be known, to be followed; error vani&s;hes before the light; the publication of the Bible in the vulgar tongues of the &s;everal countries of Europe, &s;hook the Papal de&s;poti&s;m to its foundations; freed the &s;everal nations from its yoke, and mitigated the &s;lavery of tho&s;e who &s;till remained under its dominion. But the&s;e great events, &s;o conducive to the happine&s;s and improvement of mankind, were not accom|pli&s;hed without the &s;evere&s;t &s;truggles: the <HI>power that were,</HI> felt that their throne was built on <HI>ignorance;</HI> that <HI>knowledge</HI> was their greate&s;t enemy; and their grande&s;t and mo&s;t per&s;e|vering efforts were made to prevent its diffu&s;ion. Fortunately for the world, every endeavor, to &s;tifle the curio&s;ity of man, only excites and redoubles it; every check given to the de&s;ire of in|formation, effectually &s;preads it; and all the bulls of the Pope, and edicts of tyrants, which were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the promulgation of the Holy Go&s;pel, only &s;erved as &s;o many proclamations to the people to read them. I do not know by what fatality it happens, but it certainly is true that the &s;ame jealou&s;y of the encreasing knowledge of the people, which then agitated the Court of Rome with re&s;pect to matters of religion, &s;eems at pre&s;ent to pervade every Court in Europe with re&s;pect to the nature and principles of civil government. If we can tru&s;t to public report, in Spain, in Germany, in Ru&s;&s;ia, in Italy, books of certain de&s;criptions are &s;trictly prohibited, and the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments are denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who import or read them: they are neverthele&s;s read; for Voltaire u&s;ed to &s;ay, that his works never &s;old &s;o well as after they were burnt by the hands of the common hangman. But the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance in this war again&s;t knowledge is, that the Liberty
<PB N="4" REF="025456_0003_0FCCE47EA2F12508">
of the Pre&s;s &s;hould have found &s;o many enemies in Great-Britain. In that happy land, which owes its boa&s;ted liberty and con&s;titution, and all its con&s;equent pro&s;perity to freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; a&s;&s;ociations have been formed to &s;tifle it, and as far as their power can reach, to keep the great body of the people in utter darkne&s;s regarding their civil rights.</P>
<P>There is a malignity in the principles and de&s;igns of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, (which however, were begun and are continued under the patronage of a Cabinet Mini&s;ter,) that cannot be too much expo&s;ed and reprobated. They do not pretend to be able to prevent the higher cla&s;&s;es of the community from read|ing any books they choo&s;e; but they &s;et their faces again&s;t the in&s;truction of the poor. They adverti&s;e rewards, they &s;ub|&s;cribe money to pro&s;ecute the venders&punc; or purcha&s;ers of cheap publications on the topics of liberty: while, at the &s;ame time, they expend con&s;iderable &s;ums in di&s;&s;eminating every produc|tion which can exalt the monarchical part of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations have been &s;ufficient to induce me, to offer to the public a cheap edition of the famous &s;peech pro|nounced by the Hon. Thomas Er&s;kine, on the trial of the ce|lebrated Thomas Paine, for publi&s;hing his work called "the Rights of Man." It is fit that the glorious doctrines contained in this mo&s;t fini&s;hed piece of oratory &s;hould be known to every man in the&s;e kingdoms; that the people may know where to be&s;tow their own admiration, and to point the gratitude of their po&s;terity</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to remind our readers, that this &s;peech is not a defence of Mr. Paine's book; the orator care|fully avoids giving the &s;lighte&s;t opinion of its doctrines, in which his Editor &s;hall certainly imitate him. But, in this &s;u|blime effort of the human genius, the genuine principles of &s;o|cial union the real axioms of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, the hi&s;to|ry of its progre&s;&s;ive improvement, and &s;en&s;ible decay, are de|lineated with a force and beauty of expre&s;&s;ion that mu&s;t delight and convince tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s only the gift of God to the poor as well as rich, I mean &s;trong <HI>Common Sen&s;e;</HI> while they cannot fail to captivate the warme&s;t admiration of the deepe&s;t learning and mo&s;t refined ta&s;te. It ought to be a matter of national pride to the people of Scotland, that Mr. Er&s;kine is their country|man: They have been accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t &s;hining abil|ities in his family; in <HI>him</HI> they meet with tran&s;cendant talents, uniformly devoted to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es. He is the <HI>Lawyer of the People and Con&s;titution;</HI> again&s;t the encroachments of the executive government: he is the defender of Juries, again&s;t the unwarrantable a&s;&s;umptions of Judges. Wherever the &s;tron|ge&s;t attacks are made again&s;t the liberty of the &s;ubject, there

you are &s;ure to find him in the foremo&s;t rank, combating the mon&s;ters like Hercules, and bearing down all before him by an irre&s;i&s;tible torrent of eloquence.</P>

<HEAD>THE CELEBRATED SPEECH OF THE <HI>HON. T. ERSKINE.</HI> IN SUPPORT OF THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Attorney General, in that part of his addre&s;s which aro&s;e from a letter, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written to him from France, exhibited &s;igns of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility and emotion. I do not, I am &s;ure, charge him with acting a part to &s;educe you; on the contrary, I am per&s;uaded from my own feelings, and from my acquain|tance with my friend from our childhood upwards, that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as he felt. But, gentlemen, if he felt tho&s;e painful embarra&s;&s;ments, think what mine mu&s;t be: he can only feel for the augu&s;t character whom he repre&s;ents in this place, as a &s;ubject for his &s;overeign, too far removed by cu&s;tom, and by law, from the inter|cour&s;es which generate affections, to produce any other &s;entiments than tho&s;e that flow from a relation common to us all. But it will be remembered, that I &s;tand in the same relation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Er&s;kine is Attorney General to the Prince of Wales.</NOTE> towards another Great Per&s;on, more deeply implicated by this &s;upposed letter; who, not re&s;trained from the cultivation of per&s;onal attachment by tho&s;e qualifications which mu&s;t always &s;ecure them, has exalted my duty of a &s;ubject to a Prince, into a warm and hone&s;t affection between man and man. Thus circum&s;tanced,
<PB N="8" REF="025456_0006_0FCD3EB713D5F508">
I certainly &s;hould have been glad to have had an earlier opportunity of knowing correctly the contents of this let|ter, and whether (which I po&s;itively deny) it proceeded from the defendant. Coming thus &s;uddenly upon us, I &s;ee but too plainly the impre&s;&s;ion it has made upon you who are to try the cau&s;e, and I feel its weight upon my&s;elf, who am to conduct it; but this &s;hall neither detach me from my duty, nor added to all the other difficulties that thicken around me, enervate me, (if I can help it) in the di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if the Attorney General is well founded in the commentaries he has made to you upon this book which he pro&s;ecutes; if he is warranted by the law of England, in repre&s;&s;ing its circulation, through the&s;e realms, from the illegal and dangerous matters contained in it; if that &s;uppre&s;&s;ion be, as he avows it, and as in common &s;en&s;e it mu&s;t be, the &s;ole object of the pro&s;ecution, the public has great rea&s;on to lament that this letter &s;hould have been at all brought into the &s;ervice of the cau&s;e: it is no part of the charge upon the record; it had no exi&s;tence for months after the work was compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed; it was not even written, if written at all, till after he had been at Dover, in a manner in&s;ultingly expelled from the country by the influence of government, and had become the &s;ubject of another country. It cannot, therefore, by any fair inference, even decypher the mind of the author when he compo&s;ed his work; &s;till le&s;s can it affect the con&s;truction of the language in which the work it&s;elf is written. The introduction of this letter at all is, therefore, not only a departure from the charge, but a &s;ort of derelic|tion of the object of the pro&s;ecution, which is to con|demn the book: for if the condemnation of the author is to be obtained, not by the work it&s;elf, but by collateral mat|ter not even exi&s;ting when it was written, nor known to its various publi&s;hers throughout the kingdom, how can a verdict upon &s;uch grounds condemn the work, or cri|minate other publi&s;hers, &s;trangers to the collateral man|ner on which the conviction may be obtained? I main|tain, therefore, that upon every principle of found policy, as it affects the intere&s;t of the crown, and upon every rule of ju&s;tice, as it affects the author of the Rights of Man, the letter &s;hould be wholly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025456_0007_0FCD3EBA89E96E08">Gentlemen, the Attorney General has thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to inform you, that a rumour had been &s;pread, and had reached his ears, that he only carried on the pro&s;ecu|tion as a public pro&s;ecutor, but without the concurrence of his own private judgment; and therefore to add the ju&s;t weight of his own character to his public duty, and to re|pel what he thinks a calumny, he tells you that he &s;hould have de&s;erved to have been driven from &s;ociety, if he had not arraigned the work and the author before you.</P>
<P>Here too we &s;tand in &s;ituations very different. I have no doubt of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a rumour, and of its ha|ving reached his ears, becau&s;e he &s;ays &s;o; but for the narrow circle in which any rumour, per&s;onally implicating my learned friend's character, has extended, I might ap|peal to the multitudes who &s;urround us, and a&s;k, which of all them, except the few connected in office with the crown, ever heard of its exi&s;tence. But with regard to my&s;elf, every man who hears me at this moment, nay, the whole People of England, have been witne&s;&s;es to the ca|lumnious clamour, that by every art, has been rai&s;ed and kept up again&s;t me: In every place, where bu&s;ine&s;s or plea|&s;ure collect the public together, day after day my name and character have been the topics of injurious reflection. And for what?&mdash;only for not having &s;hrunk from the di&s;|charge of a duty which no per&s;onal advantage recommend|ed, and which a thou&s;and difficulties repelled. But, gen|tlemen, I have no complaint to make, either again&s;t the printers of the&s;e libels, nor even again&s;t their authors; the greater part of them, hurried perhaps away by hone&s;t prejudices, may have believed they were &s;erving their country by rendering me the object of its &s;u&s;picion and contempt; and if there have been among&s;t them others who have mixed in it from per&s;onal malice and unkind|ne&s;s, I thank God I it can forgive them al&s;o.&mdash;Little in|deed did they know me, who thought that &s;uch proceed|ings would influence my conduct: I will forever, at all hazards, a&s;&s;ert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the <HI>ENGLISH BAR;</HI> without which, impartial ju&s;tice, the mo&s;t valuable part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution can have no exi&s;tence. For, from the moment that any advocate can be permitted to &s;ay that he will or will not &s;tand be|tween the crown and a &s;ubject arraigned in the court where
<PB N="10" REF="025456_0008_0FCD3EBB69FD5808">
he daily &s;its to practi&s;e, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end. If the advocate refu&s;es to defend from what he may think of the charge or of the defence, he a&s;&s;umes the character of the judge; nay, he a&s;&s;umes it before the hour of judgment; and, in proportion to his rank and reputation, puts the heavy influence of, perhaps, a mi&s;taken opinion into the &s;cale again&s;t the accu&s;ed, in who&s;e favor the benevolent principle of Engli&s;h law makes all pre&s;umptions, and, which commands the very Judge to be his coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is now my duty to addre&s;s my&s;elf regu|larly, and without digre&s;&s;ion to the defence. And the fir&s;t thing which pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a judi|cial &s;ubject, and indeed of every other, is to &s;tate di&s;tinctly and with preci&s;ion, what the que&s;tion is, and (where pre|judice and mi&s;repre&s;entation have been exerted,) to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it accurately from what it is not. The que&s;tion then is NOT whether the con&s;titution of our fathers, under which we live&mdash;under which I pre&s;ent my&s;elf before you, and under which alone you have any juri&s;diction to hear me,&mdash;be or be not preferable to the con&s;titution of Ame|rica or France, or any other human con&s;titution. For upon what principal can a court, con&s;tituted by the authority of any government, and admini&s;tering a po&s;itive &s;y&s;tem of law under it, pronounce a deci&s;ion again&s;t the con&s;titution which creates its authority; or the rule of action which its juri&s;diction is to enforce? The common &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t uninformed per&s;on mu&s;t revolt at &s;uch an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I have no difficulty, therefore, in admitting, that if by accident &s;ome or all of you were alienated in opinion and affectation from the forms and principles of the Engli&s;h government, and were impre&s;&s;ed with the value of that unmixed repre&s;entative con&s;titution which this work re|commends and inculcates, you could not, on that account, acquit the defendant. Nay, to &s;peak out plainly, I freely admit, that even if you were avowed enemies to monar|chy, and devoted to republicani&s;m, you would be never|thele&s;s bound by your oaths, as a jury &s;worn to admini&s;ter Engli&s;h ju&s;tice, to convict the author of the Rights of Man, if it were brought home to your con&s;ciences, that he had exceeded tho&s;e widely extended bounds which the
<PB N="11" REF="025456_0009_0FCD3EBE2E7232A0">
ancient wi&s;dom and liberal policy of the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution have allotted to the range of a free pre&s;s. I freely concede to this, becau&s;e you have no juri&s;diction to judge either the author or the work, by any rule but by the En|gli&s;h law, which is the &s;ource of your authority. But having made this large conce&s;&s;ion, it follows, by a con&s;e|quence &s;o inevitable as to be invulnerable to all argument or artifice, that if, on the other hand, you &s;hould be im|pre&s;&s;ed (which I know you to be) not only with a dutiful regard, but with an enthu&s;ia&s;m, for the whole form and &s;ub&s;tance of your own government; and though you &s;hould think that this work, in its circulation among&s;t cla&s;&s;es of men unequal to political re&s;earches, may tend to alienate opinion, &s;till you cannot, upon the&s;e grounds, without a &s;imilar breach of duty, convict the defendant of a libel, unle&s;s he has clearly &s;tepped beyond that extended range of communication which the &s;ame ancient wi&s;dom and liberal policy of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution has allotted for the liber|ty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I admit, with the Attorney-General, that in every ca&s;e where a court has to e&s;timate the quality of a writing, the mind and intention of the writer mu&s;t be taken into account the <HI>bona,</HI> or <HI>male &s;ides,</HI> as lawyers ex|pre&s;s it, mu&s;t be examined: for a writing may undoubt|edly proceed from a motive, and be directed to a purpo&s;e, not to be decyphered by the mere con&s;truction of the thing written. But wherever a writing is arraigned as &s;editious or &s;landerous, not upon its ordinary con&s;truction in lan|guage, nor from the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of its publica|tion, under any circum&s;tances and at all times, but that the criminality &s;prings from &s;ome extrin&s;ic matter, not vi&s;ible upon the page it&s;elf, nor univer&s;ally operative, but capable only of being connected with it by evidence, &s;o as to demon&s;trate the effect of the publication, and the de&s;ign of the publi&s;her; &s;uch a writing, not libellous PER SE, cannot be arraigned as the author's work is arraigned upon the record before the court. I maintain without the ha|zard of contradiction, that the law of England po&s;itively requires, for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject, that every charge of a libel complicated with extrin&s;ic facts and circum&s;tan|ces, <HI>dehors the writing,</HI> mu&s;t appear literally upon the re|cord, that the defendant may know what crime he is cal|led
<PB N="12" REF="025456_0010_0FCD3EBF28E2D7B8">
upon to an&s;wer, and how to &s;tand upon his defence. What crime is it that the defendant comes to an&s;wer for to-day? What is the notice that I, who am his coun&s;el, have from this parchment of the crime alledged again&s;t him? I come to defend his having written this book. The record &s;tates nothing el&s;e; the charge of &s;edition in the introduction is notoriou&s;ly paper and pack-thread, and the innuendoes cannot enlarge the &s;en&s;e, or natural con&s;truction of the text. The record does not &s;tate any one extrin&s;ic fact or circum&s;tance, to render the work cri|minal, at one time more than another; it &s;tates no peculi|arity of time, &s;ea&s;on, or intention, not proveable from the writing it&s;elf, which is the naked charge upon record. There is nothing therefore which, upon any principle of Engli&s;h law, gives you any juri&s;diction beyond the con|&s;truction of the <HI>work it&s;elf;</HI> and you cannot be ju&s;tified in finding it criminal becau&s;e publi&s;hed at this time, unle&s;s it would have been a criminal publication under any circum|&s;tances, or at any other time.</P>
<P>The law of England then, both in its forms and &s;ub|&s;tance, being the only rule by which the author or the work can be ju&s;tified or condemned, and the charge upon the record being the naked charge of a libel, the cau&s;e re&s;olves it&s;elf into a que&s;tion of the deepe&s;t importance to us all, <HI>the nature and extent of the liberty of the Engli&s;h Pre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But before I enter upon it, I wi&s;h to fulfil a duty to the defendant, which, if I do not deceive my&s;elf, is at this moment peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to his impartial trial. If an advocate entertains &s;entiments injurious to the defence he is engaged in, he is not only ju&s;tified but bound in duty to conceal them; &s;o, on the other hand, if his own gen|uine &s;entiments, or any thing connected with his charac|ter or &s;ituation, can add &s;trength to his profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, he is bound to throw them into the &s;cale: in ad|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, therefore, to gentlemen not only zealous for the honor of Engli&s;h government, but vi&s;ibly indignant at any attack upon its principles, and who would, perhaps, be impatient of arguments from a &s;u&s;pected quarter, I give my client the benefit of declaring, that I am, and ever have been attached to the genuine principles of the Briti&s;h go|vernment;&mdash;and that, however the court or you may reject
<PB N="13" REF="025456_0011_0FCD3EC29C410070">
the application, I defend him upon principles not only con&s;istent with its permanence and &s;ecurity, but, without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which, it never could have had an exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition which I mean to maintain as the ba|&s;is of the liberty of the pre&s;s, and without which it is an empty &s;ound, is this:</P>
<P>That every man, not intending to mi&s;lead and to con|found, but &s;eeking to enlighten others with what his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on and con&s;cience, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, dictate to him as truth, may addre&s;s him&s;elf to the univer&s;al rea&s;on of a whole nation, either upon the &s;ubject of governments in general, or upon that of our own particular country: that he may analyze the principles of its con&s;titution, point out its errors and defects, examine and publi&s;h its corruptions, warn his fellow-citizens again&s;t their ruinous con&s;equences, and exert his whole faculties in pointing out the mo&s;t ad|vantageous changes in e&s;tabli&s;hments which he con&s;iders to be radically defective, or &s;liding from their object by abu&s;e. All this, every &s;ubject of this country has a right to do, if he contemplates only what he thinks its happine&s;s, and but &s;eeks to change the public mind by the conviction which flows from rea&s;onings dictated by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If, indeed, he writes what he does not think; If con|templating the mi&s;ery of others, he wickedly condemns what his own under&s;tanding approves; or, even admitting his real di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the government or its corruptions, if he calumniates <HI>living magi&s;trates,</HI> or holds out to indi|viduals, that they have a right to run before the public mind in their conduct; that they may oppo&s;e by contuma|cy or force, what private rea&s;on only di&s;approves; that they may di&s;obey the law, becau&s;e their judgment con|demns it; or re&s;i&s;t the public will, becau&s;e they hone&s;tly wi&s;h to change it: he is then a criminal upon every prin|cipal of rational policy, as well as upon the immemorial precedents of Engli&s;h ju&s;tice; becau&s;e &s;uch a per&s;on &s;eeks to di&s;unite individuals from their duty to the whole, and excites to overt acts of mi&s;conduct in a part of the com|munity, in&s;tead of endeavoring to change, by the impul&s;e of rea&s;on, that univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent which, in this and in every country, con&s;titutes the law for all.</P>
<P>I have therefore no difficulty in admitting that, if, upon
<PB N="14" REF="025456_0012_0FCD3EC3F964EEA0">
an attentive peru&s;al of this work, it &s;hall be found that the defendant has promulgated any doctrines which tend to withdraw individuals from their &s;ubjection to the law by which the whole nation con&s;ents to be governed; nay, if the direct contrary &s;hall not be found to be &s;tudiou&s;ly in|culcated&mdash;if his book &s;hall be found to have warranted or excited that unfortunate criminal who appeared here ye&s;|terday to endeavor to relieve him&s;elf from impri&s;onment, by the de&s;truction of a pri&s;on, while the law of impri&s;on|ment remained, or dictated to him the language of defiance which ran through his whole defence&mdash;if, throughout the whole work, there &s;hall be found any &s;yllable or letter, which &s;trikes at the &s;ecurity of property, or which hints that any thing le&s;s than the whole nation can con&s;titute the law, or that the law, be it what it may, is not the inexo|rable rule of action for every individual, I willingly yield him up to the ju&s;tice of the court.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ay, in the name of Thomas Paine, and in his words as author of the Rights of Man, as written in the very volume that is charged with &s;eeking the de|&s;truction of property.</P>
<P><Q>The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations is, the pre&s;erva|tion of the rights of man, which rights are liberty, property, and &s;ecurity; that the nation is the &s;ource of all &s;overeignty derived from it: the right of property be|ing &s;ecured and inviolable, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in ca&s;es of evident public nece&s;&s;ity, legally a&s;certained, and on condition of a previous ju&s;t indem|nity.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are undoubtedly the rights of man&mdash;the rights for which all governments are e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;and the only rights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. Paine contends for; but which he thinks (no matter whether right or wrong,) are better to be &s;ecured by a republican con&s;titution than by the forms of the En|gli&s;h government. He in&s;tructs me to admit that; when government is once constituted, no individuals, without rebellion, can withdraw their obedience from it&mdash;that all attempts to excite then to it, are highly criminal, for the mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons of policy and ju&s;tice&mdash;that nothing &s;hort of the will of whole people can change or affect the rule by which a nation is to be governed&mdash;and that no private opinion, however hone&s;tly inimical to the forms or
<PB N="15" REF="025456_0013_0FCD3EC6AD56E730">
&s;ub&s;tance of the law, can ju&s;tify re&s;i&s;tance to its authority, while it remains in force. The author of the Rights of Man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine, but he con&s;ents to be convicted, and I al&s;o con&s;ent for him, unle&s;s his work &s;hall be found &s;tudiou&s;ly and painfully to incul|cate the&s;e great principles of government which it is char|ged to have been written to de&s;troy. Let me not, there|fore, be &s;u&s;pected to be contending, that it is lawful to write a book pointing out defects in the Engli&s;h govern|ment, and exciting individuals to de&s;troy its &s;anctions, and to refu&s;e obedience. But, on the other hand, I do contend, that it is lawful to addre&s;s the Engli&s;h nation on the&s;e mo|mentous &s;ubjects, for had it not been for this unalienable right, (thanks be to God and our fathers for e&s;tabli&s;hing it,) how &s;hould we have had this con&s;titution which we &s;o loudly boa&s;t of? If, in the march of the human mind, no man could have gone before the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the time he lived in, how could our e&s;tabli&s;hment, by reiterated changes, have become what it is? If no man could have awakened the public mind to errors and abu&s;es in our go|vernment, how could it have pa&s;&s;ed on from &s;tage to &s;tage, through reformation and revolution, &s;o as to have arrived from barbari&s;m to &s;uch a pitch of happine&s;s and perfection that the Attorney General con&s;iders it as profanation to touch it any further, or to look for any future amendment.</P>
<P>In this manner power has rea&s;oned in every age; go|vernment, in <HI>its own e&s;timation,</HI> has been at all times a &s;y&s;|tem of perfection; but a free pre&s;s has examined and de|tected its errors, and the people have happily reformed them: this freedom has alone made our government what it is, and alone can pre&s;erve it; and therefore, under the banners of that freedom, to-day I &s;tand up to defend Tho|mas Paine. But how, alas! &s;hall this ta&s;k be accompli&s;hed? How may I expect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of? How am I to addre&s;s your rea&s;ons, or a&s;k them to pau&s;e, amid&s;t the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the &s;ubject you are to judge?</P>
<P>Was any Engli&s;hman ever &s;o brought as a criminal be|fore an Engli&s;h court of ju&s;tice? If I were to a&s;k you, gentlemen of the jury, what is the choice&s;t fruit that grows upon the tree of Engli&s;h liberty, you would an&s;wer, <HI>&s;ecurity
<PB N="16" REF="025456_0014_0FCD3EC853E385B0">
under the law.</HI> If I were to a&s;k the whole people of En|gland, the return they looked for at the hands of govern|ment, for the burthens under which they bend to &s;upport it, I &s;hould &s;till be an&s;wered, <HI>&s;ecurity under the law;</HI> or, in other words, an impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. So &s;acred, therefore, has the freedom of trial been ever held in England; &s;o anxiou&s;ly does ju&s;tice guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible bias in her path, that if the public mind has been lo|cally agitated upon any &s;ubject in judgment, the form is either changed, or the trial po&s;tponed. The circulation of any paper that brings, or which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to bring, prejudice, or even well-founded knowledge, within the reach of a Briti&s;h tribunal, on the &s;pur of an occa&s;ion, is not only highly criminal, but defeats it&s;elf, by leading to put off the trial which its object was to pervert. On this principle, his Lord&s;hip will permit me to remind him, that on the trial of the Dean of St. A&s;aph for a libel, or rather when he was brought to trial, the circulation of books by a &s;ociety favorable to his defence, was held by the no|ble Lord, as Chief Ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, to be a rea&s;on for not trying the cau&s;e; although they contained no matter re|lative to the Dean, nor to the object of his trial; being only extracts from ancient authors of high reputation, on the general rights of juries to con&s;ider the innocence as well as the guilt of the accu&s;ed; yet &s;till, as the recollecti|on of the&s;e rights was pre&s;&s;ed forward with a view to af|fect the proceedings, to guard the principle, the proceedings were po&s;tponed.</P>
<P>Is the defendant then to be the only exception to the&s;e admirable provisions? Is the Engli&s;h law to judge him, &s;cript of the armour with which its univer&s;al ju&s;tice encir|cles all others? Shall we, in the very act of judging him for detracting from the Engli&s;h government, furni&s;h him with ample matter for ju&s;t reprobation, in&s;tead of detracti|on? Has not his cau&s;e been prejudged through a thou&s;and channels? Has not the work before you been daily pub|licly reviled, and his per&s;on held up to deri&s;ion and re|proach? Has not the public mind been excited, by crying down the very phra&s;e and idea of the Rights of Man? Nay, have not a&s;&s;ociations of gentlemen, I &s;peak it with regret, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded, from what I know of &s;ome of them, that they, among&s;t them at lea&s;t, thought they were
<PB N="17" REF="025456_0015_0FCD3ECAED668348">
&s;erving the public; yet have they not, in utter contempt and ignorance of that con&s;titution of which they declare them&s;elves to be the guardians, publi&s;hed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t at|tacks upon the defendant? Have they not, even while the cau&s;e has been &s;tanding here in the paper for immediate trial, publi&s;hed a direct prote&s;t again&s;t the very work now before you, adverti&s;ing in the &s;ame paper, though under the general de&s;cription of &s;editious papers, a reward on the conviction of any per&s;on who &s;hould dare to &s;ell the book it&s;elf, to which their own publication was an an&s;wer?</P>
<P>The Attorney General has &s;poken of a forced circulation of this work; but how have the&s;e prejudging papers been circulated? We all know how: they have been thrown into our carriages in every &s;treet; they have met us at every turnpike; and they lie in the areas of all our hou&s;es. To complete the triumph of prejudice, that high tribunal, of which I have the honor to be a member, (my learned friends know what I &s;ay to be true) has been drawn into this vortex of &s;lander; and &s;ome of its members, for I do not &s;peak of the hou&s;e it&s;elf, have thrown the weight of their &s;tations into the &s;ame &s;cale.</P>
<P>By all means I maintain that this cau&s;e has been pre|judged.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that I have made no motion to put off the trial for the&s;e cau&s;es, and that courts of them&s;elves take no cognizance of what pa&s;&s;es el&s;ewhere, without facts laid before them. Gentlemen, I know that I &s;hould have had equal ju&s;tice from that quarter, if I had brought my&s;elf within the rule. But when &s;hould I have been better in the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of things? And therefore I only remind you of all the&s;e hard&s;hips, that you may recol|lect that your judgment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here, upon the evidence in the cau&s;e, and not upon &s;ugge&s;tions de&s;tructive of every principle of ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed of the&s;e foreign prejudices, I hope you will as little regard &s;ome arguments that have been offered to you in court. The letter which has been &s;o repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed upon you, ought to di&s;mi&s;s even from your recollection; I have already put it out of the que&s;|tion, as having been written long &s;ub&s;equent to the book, and as being a libel on the King, which no part of the
<PB N="18" REF="025456_0016_0FCD3ECBE88974E8">
information charges, and which may hereafter be pro&s;e|cuted as a di&s;tinct offence. I con&s;ider that letter be&s;ides, and indeed have always heard it treated, as a forgery, contrived to injure the merits of the cau&s;e, and to embarra&s;s me per&s;onally in its defence.&mdash;I have a right &s;o to con|&s;ider it, becau&s;e it is un&s;upported by any thing &s;imilar at an earlier period. The defendant's whole deportment, previous to the publication, has been wholly unexceptiona|ble: he properly de&s;ired to be given up as the author of the book, if any inquiry &s;hould take place concerning it; and he is not affected in evidence, directly or indirectly, with any illegal or &s;u&s;picious conduct; not even with having uttered an indi&s;creet or taunting expre&s;&s;ion, nor with any one matter or thing, incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of the be&s;t &s;ubject in England. His opinions indeed were adver&s;e to our &s;y&s;tem; but I maintain that <HI>opinion</HI> is free, and that <HI>conduct</HI> alone is amenable to the law.</P>
<P>You are next de&s;ired to judge of the author's mind and intention, by the modes and extent of the circulation of his work. The fir&s;t part of the Rights of Man, Mr. Attorney General tells you, he did not pro&s;ecute, al|though it was in circulation through the country for a year and a half together, becau&s;e it &s;eems it circulated on|ly among&s;t what he &s;tyles the judicious part of the pub|lic, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their capacities and experience an antidote to the poi&s;on; but that with regard to the &s;e|cond part now before you, its circulation had been forced into every corner of &s;ociety; had been printed and re|printed for cheapne&s;s even upon whited brown paper, and had crept into the very nur&s;eries of children, as a wrapper for their &s;weetmeats.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this &s;tatement, which after all &s;tands only upon Mr. Attorney General's own a&s;&s;ertion, un&s;upported by any kind of proof, (no witne&s;s having proved the author's per&s;onal interference with the &s;ale,) I &s;till main|tain, that if he had the mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly promoted it, the que&s;tion would remain exactly the &s;ame: the que&s;tion would &s;till be, Whether at the time when Paine compo&s;ed his work, and promoted the mo&s;t exten&s;ive purcha&s;e of it, he believed or di&s;believed what he had written, and whether he contemplated the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the Engli&s;h nation, to which it is addre&s;&s;ed; and whichever
<PB N="19" REF="025456_0017_0FCD3ECE2A8E39E0">
of the&s;e intentions may be evidenced to your judgments upon reading the book it&s;elf? I confe&s;s I am utterly at a lo&s;s to comprehend how a writer can be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean &s;omething different from what he has written, by an anxiety (common I believe to all authors,) that his work &s;hould be generally read.</P>
<P>Remember, I am not a&s;king your opinions of the <HI>doctrines them&s;elves,</HI> you have given them already pret|ty vi&s;ibly &s;ince I began to addre&s;s you; but I &s;hall ap|peal not only to you, but to tho&s;e who, without our leave, will hereafter judge without appeal, of all that we are doing to day; Whether, upon the matter which I ha&s;ten to lay before you, you can refu&s;e in ju&s;tice to pronounce, that, from his education&mdash;form the accidents and habits of his life&mdash;from the time and occa&s;ion of the publication&mdash;from the circum&s;tances attending it&mdash;and from every line and letter of the work it&s;elf, and all his other writings, before and <HI>even &s;ince,</HI> his con&s;cience and under&s;tanding (no matter whether erroneou&s;ly or not) were deeply and &s;olemly impre&s;&s;ed with the matter con|tained in his book, &mdash;that he addre&s;&s;ed it to the rea&s;on of the nation at large, and not to the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals, and that in the i&s;&s;ue of its influence, he contemplated only what appeared to <HI>him (though it may not to us,)</HI> to be intere&s;t and happine&s;s of England, and of the whole human race? In drawing the one or the other of the&s;e conclu&s;ions, the book stands fir&s;t in order, and it &s;hall now &s;peak for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the whole of it is evidence before you; the particular parts arraigned have only been read by my con&s;ent, upon the pre&s;umption that, on retiring from the court, you would carefully compare them with the con|text, and all the parts with the whole viewed together. You cannot indeed do ju&s;tice without it. The mo&s;t com|mon letter, even in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, cannot be read in a cau&s;e to prove an obligation for twenty &s;hil|lings, without the whole being read, that the writer's meaning may be &s;een without deception. But in a crimi|nal charge of only four pages and a half, out of a work containing nearly two hundred, you cannot, with even the appearance of common ju&s;tice, pronounce a judgment with|out the mo&s;t deliberate and cautious compari&s;on. I ob&s;erve
<PB N="20" REF="025456_0018_0FCD3ECFACDB2398">
that the noble and learned judge confirms me in this ob&s;er|vation. But if any given part of a work be legally expla|natory of every other part of it, the preface, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> is the mo&s;t material; becau&s;e the preface is the author's own key to his writing: it is there that he takes the reader by the hand, and introduces him to his &s;ubject: it is there that the &s;pirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue. A preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or carele&s;s readers: the author &s;ays by it, to every man who choo&s;es to begin where he ought, Look at my plan&mdash;attend to my di&s;tinctions&mdash;mark the purpo&s;e and limitations of the matter I lay before you.</P>
<P>Let then the calumniators of Thomas Paine now attend to his preface, where, to leave no excu&s;e for ignorance or mi&s;repre&s;entation, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:</P>
<Q><P>I have differed from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen on the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecutions, and I &s;ince find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here &s;tate as &s;ully, but as conci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t put a ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m, or what in Eng|land is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohi|bit inve&s;tigating the principles, good or bad, on which &s;uch a law, or any other, is founded.</P>
<P>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the prac|tice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors&punc; to rea&s;on on its defects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it al&s;o my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e at the &s;ame time of every argument to &s;hew its errors and procure its re|peal, than forcibly to violate it; becau&s;e the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force and lead to a di&s;cretionary violation, of tho&s;e which are good.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with principles and forms of government, or to what are called con&s;titutions and the parts of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emo|lument
<PB N="21" REF="025456_0019_0FCD3ED2E0E99538">
or aggrandi&s;ement of particular individuals, that government ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that man|kind are at the expence of &s;upporting it. The defects of every government and con&s;titution, both as to principle and form, mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When tho&s;e defects, and the means of re|medying them are generally &s;een by a nation, that na|tion will reform its government or its con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other.</P></Q>
<P>Gentleman, you mu&s;t undoubtedly wi&s;h to deal with every man who comes before you in judgment, as you would be dealt by your&s;elves; and &s;urely you will not lay it down to-day as a law to be binding hereafter even upon your&s;elves, that if you &s;hould publi&s;h any opinion concerning the exi&s;ting abu&s;es in your country's govern|ment, and point out to the whole public the means of amendment, you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve men may happen to agree with you in your opinions. Yet this is preci&s;ely what you are a&s;ked to do to another: it is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e before you. Mr. Paine expre&s;sly &s;ays, I obey a law until it is repealed; obedience is not only my principle, but my practice, &s;ince my di&s;obedience of a law from thinking it bad, might apply to ju&s;tify a|nother man in the di&s;obedience of a good one; and thus individuals would give the role for them&s;elves, and not &s;ociety for all.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will pre&s;ently &s;ee that the &s;ame prin|ciple pervades the re&s;t of the work; and I am the more anxious to call your attention to it, however repetition may tire you, becau&s;e it unfolds the whole principles of my argument; for, if you find a &s;entence in the whole book that inve&s;ts any individual, or any number of in|viduals, or any community &s;hort of the whole nation, with a power of changing any part of the law or con&s;ti|tution, I abandon the cau&s;e&mdash;YES, I freely abandon it, becau&s;e I will not affront the maje&s;ty of a court of ju&s;tice by maintaining propo&s;itions which, even upon the &s;ur|face of them are fal&s;e. Mr. Paine, page 162&mdash;168, goes on thus:</P>
<Q><PB N="22" REF="025456_0020_0FCD3ED6407FD690"><P>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be governed as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accompli&s;hed by rea&s;on. Rebellion con&s;i&s;ts in forcibly oppo&s;ing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, therefore, to be, in e|very nation, a method of occa&s;ionally a&s;certaining the &s;tate of public opinion with re&s;pect to government.</P>
<P>There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> re|&s;pecting a general reform; and by the &s;ame right that two per&s;ons can confer on &s;uch a &s;ubject, a thou&s;and may. The object in all &s;uch preliminary proceedings is to find out what the general &s;en&s;e of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or choo&s;e to pay ten times more taxes than there is occa&s;ion for, it has a right &s;o to do; and, &s;o long as the majority do not impo&s;e con|ditions on the minority different to what they impo&s;e them&s;elves though there may be much error, there is no inju&s;tice; neither will the error continue long. Rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will &s;oon bring things right, however wrong they may begin. By &s;uch a proce&s;s no tumult is to be apprehended. The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their interest and happine&s;s are included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuou&s;.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e are the &s;entiments of the author of the Rights of Man; and, whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our government, it never can change our &s;entiments concerning it, if our &s;entiments are ju&s;t; and a writing can never be &s;editious in the &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h law, which &s;tates that the government leans on the univer&s;al will for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this univer&s;al will is the be&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t title which his Maje&s;ty and his family have to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms; and in proportion to the wi&s;dom of our in&s;titutions, the title mu&s;t in common &s;en&s;e become the &s;tronger: &s;o little idea, indeed, have I of any other, that in my place in parliament, not a week ago, I con&s;ider|ed

it as the be&s;t way of expre&s;&s;ing my attachment to the con&s;titution, as e&s;tabli&s;hed at the Revolution, to declare, (I believe in the pre&s;ence of the heir-apparent of the crown, for whom I have greate&s;t per&s;onal zeal) that his Maje&s;ty reigned in England by choice and con&s;ent, as the magi&s;|trate of the Engli&s;h people; not indeed a con&s;ent and choice by per&s;onal election, like a king of Poland, the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible con&s;titution; but by the election of a family for great national objects, in defiance of that he|reditary right, which only becomes tyranny, in the &s;en&s;e of Mr. Paine, when it claims to inherit a nation, in&s;tead of governing by their con&s;ent, and continuing for its be|nefit.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;entiment has the advantage of Mr. Burke's high authority, who &s;ays with great truth, in a letter to his con&s;tituents, <Q>Too little dependence cannot be had at this time of day on names and prejudices: the eyes of mankind are opened: and communities mu&s;t be held together by a vi&s;ible and &s;olid intere&s;t.</Q> I be|lieve, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the Prince of Wales will always render this title dear to the people. The At|torney General can only tell you what he believes of him; I can tell you what I know, and what I am bound to de|clare, &s;ince this Prince may be traduced and calumniated in every part of the kingdom, without its coming often in que&s;tion, till brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge. I therefore a&s;&s;ert what the At|torney General can only hope, that, whenever that Prince &s;hall come to the throne of this country (which I hope, but by the cour&s;e of nature will never happen,) be will make the con&s;titution of Great-Britain the foundation of all his conduct.</P>
<P>Having now, Gentlemen, e&s;tabli&s;hed the author's ge|neral intention by his own introduction, which is the be&s;t and faire&s;t expo&s;ition, let us next look at the occa&s;ion which gave it birth.</P>
<P>The Attorney General, throughout the whole cour&s;e of his addre&s;s to you (I knew it would be &s;o) has avoided the mo&s;t di&s;tant notice or hint of any circum&s;tance having led to the appearance of the author in the political world, af|ter a &s;ilence of &s;o many years; he has not even pronounced or even glanced at the name of Mr. Burke, but has left

you to take it for granted that the defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous &s;ubject; and that, without being led to it by the provocation of political controver&s;y, he had &s;eized a favorable moment to &s;tigmatize, from mere malice, and again&s;t his own confirmed opinions, the Con|&s;titution of this Country.</P>
<P>Gentleman, my learned friend knows too well my re&s;pect and value for him to &s;uppo&s;e that I am charging him with a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; I know him to be incapable of it; he knew it would come from me. He will permit me how|ever, to lament that it &s;hould have been left for me, at this late period of the cau&s;e, to inform you, that, not only the work before you, but the Fir&s;t Part, of which it is a natu|ral continuation, were written <HI>avowedly, and upon the face of them.</HI> IN ANSWER TO MR.

They were writ|ten be&s;ides under circum&s;tances which I &s;hall hereafter ex|plain, and in the cour&s;e of which explanation I am have occa&s;ion to cite a few pa&s;&s;ages from the works of that cele|brated per&s;on. And I &s;hall &s;peak of him with the highe&s;t re&s;pect: for, with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my humble talents, however he may di&s;|parage the principles which direct my public conduct, he &s;hall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity. After the gratitude which we owe to God for the divine gifts of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, our next thanks are due to tho&s;e from the fountain of who&s;e enlightened minds they are fed and fructified. But pleading, as I do, the cau&s;e of free|dom of opinions, I &s;hall not give offence by remarking that this great author has been thought to have changed &s;ome of his; and, if Thomas Paine had not though &s;o, I &s;hould not now be addre&s;&s;ing you, becau&s;e the book which is my &s;ubject would never have been written. Who is right and who is wrong, in the contention of doctrines, I have repeatedly di&s;claimed to be the que&s;tion; I can only &s;ay that Mr. Paine may be right throughout, but Mr. Burke cannot&mdash;Mr. Paine has been uniform in his opini|ons, but Mr. Burke has not&mdash;Mr. Burke can only be right in part; but &s;hould Mr. Paine be even mi&s;taken in the whole, &s;till I am not removed from the principle of his defence. My defence has nothing to do with either the

concealment or rectitude of his doctrines. I admit Mr. Paine to be a republican: you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> one&mdash;I do not &s;eek to &s;hade or qualify his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;titution; I put my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> doubtedly means to declare it to be defective in it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and contaminated with abu&s;es, which, in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> vain to mince the matter; this is the &s;cope of his work. But &s;till, if it contains no attack upon the King's Maje&s;ty, nor upon any other living magi&s;trate; if it excites to no re&s;i&s;tance to magi&s;tracy, but, on the contrary, if it even in|culcates, as it does, obedience to government, then, what|ever may be its defects, the que&s;tion continues as before, and ever mu&s;t remain an unmixed que&s;tion of the liberty of the pre&s;s. I therefore con&s;idered it as no breach of profe&s;|&s;ional duty, nor injurious to the cau&s;e I am defending, to expre&s;s my own admiration of the real principles of our con&s;titution; a con&s;titution which I hope never to &s;ee give way to any other; a con&s;titution which has been productive of various benefits, and which will produce many more here|after, if we have wi&s;dom enough to pluck up tho&s;e weeds that grow in the riche&s;t &s;oils, and among&s;t the brighte&s;t flowers. I agree with the merchants of London, that the Engli&s;h government is equal to the reformation of its own abu&s;es; and, as an inhabitant of the city, I would have &s;igned their Declaration, if I had known, <HI>of my own know|ledge,</HI> the facts recited in its preamble. But abu&s;es the Engli&s;h con&s;titution unque&s;tionably has, which call loudly for reformation, the exi&s;tence of which has been the theme of our greate&s;t &s;tate&s;men, which have too plainly formed the principles of the defendant, and created the very con|juncture which produced his book.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we all but too well remember the calamitous &s;ituation in which our country &s;tood but a few years ago; a &s;ituation which no man can look back upon, without horror, nor feel him&s;elf &s;afe from relap&s;ing into again, while the cau&s;es remain which produce it. The event I allude to, you mu&s;t know to be the American war, and the &s;till exi&s;ting cau&s;es of it, the corruptions of this govern|ment. In tho&s;e days it was not thought virtue by the pa|triots of England to conceal their exi&s;tence from the peo|ple;
<PB N="26" REF="025456_0024_0FCD3EDD95D4EDA0">
but then, as now, authority condemned them as di&s;affected &s;ubjects, and defeated the ends they &s;ought by their promulgation.</P>
<P>Hear the opinion of Sir George Saville; not his &s;pecu|lative opinion concerning the &s;tructure of our government in the ab&s;tract, but his opinion of the &s;ettled abu&s;es which prevailed in his own time, and which continue at this mo|ment. But fir&s;t let me remind you who Sir George Saville was&mdash;I fear we &s;hall hardly look upon his like again&mdash; How &s;hall I de&s;cribe him to you?&mdash;In my own words I cannot. I was lately commended by Mr. Burke in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for &s;trengthening my own language by an appeal to Dr. John&s;on. Were the honorable gentle|man pre&s;ent at this moment, he would no doubt doubly applaud my choice in re&s;orting to his own works for the de&s;cription of Sir George Saville.</P>
<P><Q>His fortune is among the large&s;t; a fortune, which, wholly unincumbered as it is, without one &s;ingle charge from luxury, vanity, or exce&s;s, &s;inks under the benevo|lence of its di&s;pen&s;er. This private benevolence, ex|panding it&s;elf into patrioti&s;m, renders his whole being the e&s;tate of the public, in which he has not re&s;erved a <HI>peculium</HI> for him&s;elf of profit, diver&s;ion, or relaxation. During the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t in, and the la&s;t out of the Hou&s;e of Commons; he pa&s;&s;es from the &s;enate to the camp; and, &s;eldom &s;eeing the &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, he is always in Parliament to &s;erve his country, or, in the field to defend it.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cribe to &s;uch a character any prin|ciple but patrioti&s;m, when he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<Q><P>I return to you baffled and di&s;pirited, and I am &s;orry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope of &s;eeing any change in the mi&s;erable cour&s;e of public calamities.</P>
<P>On this melancholy day of account, in rendering up to you my tru&s;t, I deliver to you your &s;hare of a coun|try maimed and weakened; its trea&s;ures lavi&s;hed and mi&s;pent; its honors faded; and its conduct the laugh|ing-&s;tock of Europe: our nation in a manner without allies or friends, except &s;uch as we have hired to de&s;troy our fellow-&s;ubjects, and to ravage a country, in which we once claimed an invaluable &s;hare. I return to you
<PB N="27" REF="025456_0025_0FCD3EDEABEE4AC8">
&s;ome of your principal privileges impeached and man|gled. And la&s;tly, I leave you, as I conceive, at this hour and moment fully, effectually, and ab&s;olutely, un|der the di&s;cretion and power of a military force, which is to act without waiting for the authority of the civil magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Some have been accu&s;ed of exaggerating the public misfortunes, nay, of having endeavored to help forward the mi&s;chief, that they might afterwards rai&s;e di&s;con|tents. I am willing to hope, that neither my temper, nor my &s;ituation of life, will he thought naturally to urge me to promote mi&s;ery, di&s;cord, or confu&s;ion, or to exult in the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, or in the ruin of property. I have no rea&s;on to contemplate with plea|&s;ure the poverty of our country, the increa&s;e of our debts, and of our taxes; or the decay of our commerce. Tru&s;t not, however to my report; reflect, compare, and judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>But, under all the&s;e di&s;heartening circum&s;tances, I could yet entertain a cheerful hope, and undertake a|gain the commi&s;&s;ion with alacrity, as well as zeal, if I could &s;ee any effectual &s;teps taken to remove the original cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief&mdash;'Then would there be a hope'.</P>
<P>But, till the purity of the con&s;tituent body, and there|by that of the repre&s;entative, be re&s;tored, there is NONE.</P>
<P>I gladly embrace this mo&s;t public opportunity of de|livering my &s;entiments, not only to all my con&s;tituents, but to tho&s;e likewi&s;e not my con&s;tituents, whom yet, in the large &s;en&s;e, I repre&s;ent, and am faithfully to &s;erve.</P>
<P>I look upon re&s;toring election and repre&s;entation in &s;ome degree (for I expect no miracles) to their original purity, to be that, without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous.</P>
<P>If &s;omething be not done, you may, indeed, retain the outward form of your con&s;titution, but not the power thereof.</P></Q>
<P>Such were the words of that great good man, lo&s;t with tho&s;e of many others of his time and his fame, as far as power could hurt it, put in the &s;hade along with them. The con&s;equences we have all &s;een and felt: America, from an obedient affectionate colony, became an independ|ent nation; and two millions of people, nur&s;ed in the
<PB N="28" REF="025456_0026_0FCD3EE0EAA701A0">
very lap or our monarchy, became the willing &s;ubjects of a republican con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in that great and calamitous conflict, Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine fought in the &s;ame field of rea&s;on together, but with very different &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Mr. Burke &s;poke to a parliament in England, &s;uch as Sir George Sa|ville de&s;cribes it, that had no ears but for &s;ounds that flat|tered its corruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, &s;poke TO A PEOPLE; rea&s;oned with them, that they were bound by no &s;ubjection to any &s;overeignty further than their own benefits connected them; and by the&s;e powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLO|RIOUS, JUST, and HAPPY revolution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have a right to di&s;tingui&s;h it by that ap|pellation, becau&s;e I aver that at this moment there is as &s;a|cred a regard to property, as inviolable a &s;ecurity to all the rights of individuals, lower taxes, fewer grievances, le&s;s to deplore, and more to admire, in the con&s;titution of Ameri|ca, than that of any other country under heaven. I wi&s;h indeed to except our own, but I cannot even do that, till it &s;hall be purged of tho&s;e abu&s;es, which, though they ob&s;cure and deform the &s;urface, have not as yet (thank God) de|&s;troyed the vital parts.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, becau&s;e out of a people con&s;i&s;ting of near three millions, he alone did not remain attached in opinion to monarchy. Remember, that all the blood which was &s;hed in America, and to which he was for years a melancholy and indignant witne&s;s, was &s;hed by the authority of the crown of Great-Britain, under the influence of its parliament, &s;uch as Sir George Saville has de&s;cribed it, and &s;uch as Mr. Burke him&s;elf will be called upon by and by, in more glowing colours to paint it. How then can it be wondered at, that Mr. Paine &s;hould return to this country in his heart a repub|lican? Was he not equally republican when he wrote Com|mon Sen&s;e? yet that volume has been &s;old without re&s;traint or pro&s;ecution in every &s;hop in England ever &s;ince, and which neverthele&s;s <HI>(I appeal to the book, which I have in court, and which is in every body's hands)</HI> contains every one principle of government, and every abu&s;e in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which is to be found in the Rights of Man. Yet Mr. Burke him&s;elf &s;aw no rea&s;ons to be alarmed at its
<PB N="29" REF="025456_0027_0FCD3EE268705738">
publication, nor to cry down its contents, even when Ame|rica, which was &s;wayed by it, was in arms again&s;t the crown of Great-Britain. You &s;hall hear his opinion of it, in his letter to the &s;heriffs of Bri&s;tol, pages 33 and 34.</P>
<P><Q>The court gazette accompli&s;hed what the abetters of independence had attempted in vain. When that di&s;in|genuous compilation, and &s;trange medley of railing and flattery was adduced, as a proof of the united &s;entiments of the people of Great-Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection which had &s;till &s;et towards the parent country, began immediately to turn, and to flow with great rapidity in a contrary cour&s;e. Far from concealing the&s;e wild de|clarations of enmity, <HI>the author of the celebrated pamph|let which prepared the minds of the people for independ|ence,</HI> in&s;i&s;ts largely on the multitude and the &s;pirit of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es; and draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he &s;uppo&s;es) mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of government &s;o partial to authority, as not to allow that the ho&s;tile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully ju&s;tify a change of government; nor can any rea&s;on whatever be given, why one people &s;hould voluntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a &s;uppo&s;ition of great affection and benevolence towards them. Un|fortunately your rulers, tru&s;ting to other things, took no notice of this great principle of connection.</Q></P>
<P>But there is a time, it &s;eems, for all things.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the con&s;equences of this mighty revolution are too notorious to require illu&s;tration. No audience would &s;it to hear (what every body has &s;een and felt,) the independence of America notoriou&s;ly produced, not by remote and circuitous effect, but directly and palpably, the revolutions which now agitate Europe, and which portend &s;uch new changes over the face of the earth. Let govern|ors take warning. The revolution in France was the con|&s;equence of her incurably corrupt and profligate govern|ment. God forbid that I &s;hould be thought to lean, by this declaration, upon her unfortunate monarch, bending, perhaps at this moment, under afflictions which my heart &s;inks within me to think of; but, when I &s;peak with de|te&s;tation of the former politicks of the French court, I fa&s;ten
<PB N="30" REF="025456_0028_0FCD3EE6E8D074B0">
as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince, as I impute to our gracious &s;overeign the corruptions of our own government. I de&s;ire, indeed, in the di&s;tincte&s;t man|ner, to be under&s;tood that I mean to &s;peak of his Maje&s;ty, not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a &s;ubject, but with that ju&s;tice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in pub|lic or private life.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Mr. Paine happened to be in England when the French revolution took place, and notwith&s;tanding what he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed and allowed from his hi&s;tory to have felt upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, he remained wholly &s;ilent and inactive. The people of this country too appeared to be indifferent &s;pectators of the animating &s;cene. They &s;aw, without vi&s;ible emotion, de&s;poti&s;m de&s;troyed, and the King of France, by his own con&s;ent, become the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of a free people. Certainly, at lea&s;t, it produced none of tho&s;e effects which are &s;o deprecated by government at pre&s;ent; nor, mo&s;t probably, ever would, if it had not oc|curred to the celebrated per&s;on, who&s;e name I mu&s;t &s;o often mention, voluntarily to provoke the &s;ubject; a &s;ub|ject which, if dangerous to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould not have led to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: for, &s;urely, it is not to be endu|red, that any private man is to publi&s;h a creed for a whole nation; to tell us that we are not to think for our&s;elves&mdash;to impo&s;e his own fetters upon the human mind&mdash;to dog|mati&s;e at di&s;cretion&mdash;and that no man &s;hall &s;it down to an|&s;wer him without being guilty of a libel. I a&s;&s;ert, that if it be a libel to mi&s;take our con&s;titution&mdash;to &s;upport it by means that tend to de&s;troy it&mdash;and to chu&s;e the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;ea&s;on for the interference, Mr. Burke is that libel|ler; but not therefore the object of a criminal pro&s;ecution: for, whil&s;t I am defending the motives of one man, I have neither right nor di&s;po&s;ition to criminate the motives of another. All I contend for, is a fact that cannot be contro|verted, viz. that this officious interference was the origin of Mr. Paine's book. I put my cau&s;e upon its being the origin of it&mdash;the avowed origin&mdash;as will abundantly ap|pear from the introduction and preface to both parts, and throughout the whole body of the work; nay, from the very work of Mr. Burke him&s;elf, to which both of them are an&s;wers.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="025456_0029_0FCD3EE96D174238">Gentlemen, for the hi&s;tory of that celebrated work, I appeal to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the French revolution had arrived at &s;ome of its early &s;tages, a few, and but a few, per&s;ons (not to be named when compared with the nation) took a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the&s;e mighty events; an intere&s;t well worthy of Engli&s;hmen. They &s;aw a pernicious &s;y&s;tem of government, which had led to cruel de&s;olating wars, and had been for ages the &s;courge of Great Britain, giving way to a &s;y&s;tem which &s;eemed to promi&s;e harmony and peace among&s;t the nations. They &s;aw this with virtuous and peaceable &s;atisfaction: and a reverend divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. PRICE.</NOTE>, eminent for his eloquence, recol|lecting that the i&s;&s;ues of life are in the hands of God, &s;aw no profanene&s;s in mixing the &s;ubject with public thank&s;-giving; reminding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages. It happened, al&s;o, that a &s;ociety of gentlemen, France being then a neutral nation, and her own monarch &s;wearing almo&s;t daily upon her altars to maintain the new con&s;titution, thought they infringed no law by &s;ending a general congratulation. Their numbers, indeed, were very incon&s;iderable; &s;o much &s;o, that Mr. Burke, with more truth than wi&s;dom, begins his volume with a &s;arca&s;m upon their in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P><Q>Until very lately he had never heard of &s;uch a club. It certainly never occupied a moment of his thoughts; nor, he believed, tho&s;e of any per&s;on out of their own &s;et.</Q></P>
<P>Why then make their proceedings the &s;ubject of alarm throughout England? There had been no pro&s;ecution a|gain&s;t them, nor any charge founded upon &s;u&s;picion of di&s;affection again&s;t any of their body. But Mr. Burke thought it was re&s;erved for his eloquence to whip the&s;e curs of faction to their kennels. How he has &s;ucceeded, I ap|peal to all that has happened &s;ince the introduction of his &s;chi&s;m in the Briti&s;h empire, by giving to the king, who&s;e title was que&s;tioned by no man, a title which it is his Ma|je&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;olemn intere&s;t to di&s;claim.</P>
<P>After having, in his fir&s;t work, la&s;hed Dr. Price in a &s;train of eloquent irony for con&s;idering the monarchy to be elective, which he could not but know Dr. Price, in the
<PB N="32" REF="025456_0030_0FCD3EEAB03FC2C8">
literal &s;en&s;e of election, neither did or could po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i|der it, Mr. Burke publi&s;hed a &s;econd treati&s;e; in which, after reprinting many pa&s;&s;ages from Mr. Paine's former work, he ridicules and denies the &s;uppo&s;ed right of the people to change their governments, in the following words:</P>
<P>"The French revolution," &s;ay they, (&s;peaking of the Engli&s;h &s;ocieties,) <Q>was the act of the majority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, <HI>the people of England, for in&s;tance,</HI> wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, they have the &s;ame right; ju&s;t the &s;ame un|doubtedly; that is, none at all.</Q></P>
<P>And then, after &s;peaking of the &s;ub&s;erviency of will to duty, (in which I agree with him,) he, in a &s;ub&s;tantive &s;entence, maintains the &s;ame doctrine; thus:</P>
<P><Q>The con&s;titution of a country being once &s;ettled upon &s;ome compact, tacit or expre&s;&s;ed, there is no power exi&s;ting of force to alter it, without, the breach of the covenant, or the con&s;ent of all the parties.&mdash;Such is the nature of a contract.</Q></P>
<P>So that if rea&s;on, or even revelation it&s;elf, were now to demon&s;trate to us, that our con&s;titution was mi&s;chie|vous in its effects; that, to u&s;e Mr. Attorney General's expre&s;&s;ion, we had been in&s;ane for the many centuries we have &s;upported it; yet that &s;till, if the king had not forfeited his title to the crown, nor the lords their privile|ges, the univer&s;al voice of the whole people of England could not build up a new government upon a legitimate ba&s;is.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, not to argue for the pre&s;ent again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;ition, and &s;uppo&s;ing it could, beyond all contro|ver&s;y, be maintained; for heaven's &s;ake, let wi&s;dom never utter it! Let policy and prudence forever conceal it! If you &s;eek the &s;tability of the Engli&s;h government, rather put the book of Mr. Paine, which calls it bad into ev|ery hand in the kingdom, than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even again&s;t that which is the be&s;t. Say to the people of England, Look at your con&s;titution, there it lies before you&mdash;the work of your pious fathers, handed down as a &s;acred depo&s;it from generation to genera|tion, the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom and virtue, and its parts cement|ed together with kindred blood. There are indeed a few &s;pots upon its &s;urface; but the &s;ame principle which reared
<PB N="33" REF="025456_0031_0FCD3EEC2753CF60">
the &s;tructure, will bru&s;h them all away: yon may keep it, or you may de&s;troy it. To &s;uch an addre&s;s what would be the an&s;wer? A chorus of the nation&mdash;<HI>Yes we will pre|&s;erve it.</HI> But &s;ay to the &s;ame nation, even of the very &s;ame con&s;titution, It is yours, &s;uch as it is, for better or for wor&s;e; it is &s;trapped upon your backs, to carry it as bea&s;ts of burthen, and you have no juri&s;diction to ca&s;t it off. Let this be your po&s;ition, and you in&s;tantly rai&s;e up (I ap|peal to every man's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own nature) a &s;pirit of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content. Yet it is the contro|ver&s;y alone, which this u&s;ele&s;s and mi&s;chievous propo&s;ition &s;tirred up, that has pointed mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ages arraigned before you, which it will be pre&s;ently my duty to explain.</P>
<P>But let the prudence of the argument be what it may, the argument it&s;elf is untenable.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne. No man can be &s;uppo&s;ed in the teeth of fact, to have con|tended it; but did not the people of England elect King William, and break the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? And does not his Maje&s;ty's title grow out of that election? It is one of the charges again&s;t the defendant, his having denied the par|liament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal convention of the whole people: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> very foundation of that charge, that it was &s;uch a legal convention, and that it was intended to be &s;o? And if it was &s;o, did not the people then confer the crown upon King William without any regard to hereditary right? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, who &s;tood directly in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who had incurred no per&s;onal for|feiture? Did they not give their deliverer an e&s;tate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or hi&s;tory of the country?&mdash;And, la&s;tly, might they not, by the &s;ame authority, have given the royal inheritance to the family of a &s;tranger? Mr. Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone, in his Commenta|ries, in terms, a&s;&s;erts that they might; and a&s;cribes their choice of King William, and the &s;ub&s;equent limitations of the crown not to want of juri&s;diction, but to their true o|rigin, to prudence and di&s;cretion in not di&s;turbing a valuable in&s;titution further than public &s;afety and nece&s;&s;ity dictated.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h government &s;tands then on this public con|&s;ent, the true root of all governments. And I agree with Mr. Burke, that, while it is well admini&s;tered, it is not in

the power of factions or libels to di&s;turb it; though, when mini&s;ters are in fault, they are &s;ure to &s;et down all di&s;turb|ances to the&s;e cau&s;es. This it mo&s;t ju&s;tly and eloquently exemplified in the Thoughts on the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents, pages 5 and 6.</P>
<Q><P>Mini&s;ters contend that no adequate provocation has been given for &s;o &s;preading a di&s;content, our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable tem|per and con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The wicked indu&s;try of &s;ome libellers, joined to the intrigues of a few di&s;ap|pointed politicians, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed can be more unnatural than the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions of this country, if the above ac|count be a true one. I confe&s;s I &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compul&s;ion of the cleare&s;t and firme&s;t proofs; becau&s;e their account re|&s;olves it&s;elf into this &s;hort but di&s;couraging propo&s;ition, that we have a very good mini&s;try, but that we are a very bad people; that we &s;et our&s;elves to bite the hand that feeds us; and, with a malignant in&s;anity, oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures, and ungratefully vilify the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ole object is our own peace and pro&s;perity, If a few puny libellers, acting under a knot of factious politicians, without virtue, parts, or character (for &s;uch they are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented by the&s;e gentlemen,) are &s;ufficient to excite this di&s;turbance, very perver&s;e mu&s;t be the di&s;po&s;ition of that people, among&s;t whom &s;uch a di&s;turbance can be excited by &s;uch means.</P></Q>
<P>He &s;ays true: never were &s;erious di&s;turbances excited by &s;uch means!</P>
<P>But to return to the argument. Let us now &s;ee how the rights of the people &s;tand upon authority, and whether this great &s;ource of government is not maintained by per&s;ons on whom my friend will find it hard to fa&s;ten the character of libellers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the mo&s;t modern author on the &s;ubject of government&mdash;a gentleman, who&s;e work lies &s;pread out before me, as it often does for my delight and in&s;truction in my lei&s;ure hours. I have al&s;o, by the favor of a friend

who &s;its near me in court, the honor of his per&s;onal ac|quaintance. He is a man, perhaps more than any other, devoted to the real con&s;titution of the country, as will be found throughout his valuable work; and he is a per&s;on be&s;ides, of great learning, which enabled him to infu&s;e much u&s;eful knowledge into my learned friend who introdu|ced me to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. LAW, King's coun&s;el.</NOTE>. I &s;peak of Mr. Paley, Archdeacon of Car|li&s;le, and of his work, intitled, The Principles of Political and Moral Philo&s;ophy, in which he inve&s;tigates the fir&s;t principles of all governments&mdash;a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion not thought dangerous till lately: and I hope we &s;hall &s;oon get rid of this ridiculous panic.</P>
<P>Mr. Paley profe&s;&s;es to think of governments what the Chri&s;tian religion was thought of by its fir&s;t teachers:&mdash; If it be of God it will &s;tand; and he puts the duties of obedience to them upon free will and moral duty. Af|ter di&s;&s;enting from Mr. Locke as to the origin of govern|ments in compact, he &s;ays,</P>
<Q><P>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of compact as unfounded in its principle, and dangerous in the ap|plication, we a&s;&s;ign for the only ground of the &s;ubjects, obligation, THE WILL OF GOD, AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</P>
<P>The &s;teps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct.&mdash;'It is the will of God that happine&s;s of human life be promoted:'&mdash;this is the fir&s;t &s;tep, and the foundation, not only of this, but of every moral conclu&s;ion. 'Civil &s;ociety conduces to that end:'&mdash; this is the &s;econd propo&s;ition. 'Civil &s;ocieties cannot be upheld, unle&s;s in each, the intere&s;t of the whole &s;o|ciety be binding upon every part and member of it:'&mdash; this is the third &s;tep, and conducts us to the conclu&s;ion, namely,&mdash; That &s;o long as the intere&s;t of the whole &s;o|ciety requires it (that is, &s;o long as the e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment cannot be re&s;i&s;ted or changed without public inconveniency) it is the will of God (which will univer|&s;ally determines our duty) that the e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment be obeyed,'&mdash;<HI>and no longer.</HI></P>
<P>But who &s;hall judge of this? We an&s;wer <HI>'Every man for himself.'</HI> In contentions between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject, the parties acknowledge no common

arbitrator; and it would be ab&s;urd to commit the deci|&s;ion to tho&s;e who&s;e conduct has provoked the que&s;tion and who&s;e own intere&s;t, authority, and &s;ate, are imme|diately concerned in it. The danger of error and a|bu&s;e is no objection to the rule of expediency, becau&s;e every other rule is liable to the &s;ame or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon the &s;ubject (like all rules which appeal to, or bind the con&s;cience) mu&s;t, in the application, depend upon private judgment. It may be ob&s;erved, however, that it ought equally to be accounted the exerci&s;e of a man's private judgment, whether he determines by rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions of his own, or &s;ubmits to be directed by the advice of o|thers provided he be free to choo&s;e his guide.</P></Q>
<P>He then proceeds in a manner rather incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his open|ing to you:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever, is &s;o binding that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the community. The fami|ly of the Prince&mdash;the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;the preroga|tive of the crown&mdash;the form and parts of the legi&s;lature&mdash;together with the re&s;pective powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the &s;everal parts; are all on|ly &s;o many laws, mutable, like other laws, whenever expediency requires, cither by the ordinary act of the legi&s;lature, or, if the occa&s;ion de&s;erve it, BY THE IN|TERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE.</Q></P>
<P>No man can &s;ay that Mr. Paley intended to diffu&s;e di&s;|content by this declaration. He mu&s;t therefore be taken to think with me, that freedom and affection, and the &s;en&s;e of advantages, are the be&s;t and the only &s;upports of govern|ment. On the &s;ame principle, he then goes on to &s;ay,&mdash;<Q>The&s;e points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repre&s;ented to the mind as principles of the con&s;titution, &s;ettled by our ance&s;tors, and being &s;et|tled, to be no more committed to innovation or debate; as foundations never to be &s;tirred; as the terms and con|ditions of the &s;ocial compact, to which every citizen of the &s;tate has engaged his fidelity, by virtue of a promi&s;e which he cannot now recall. Such rea&s;ons have no place in our &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="025456_0035_0FCD3EF96A8CCE98">Such are the &s;entiments of this excellent author, and there is no part of Mr. Paine's work, from the one end of it to the other, that advances any other propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But the Attorney-General will &s;ay, the&s;e are the grave &s;peculative opinions of a friend to the Engli&s;h Govern|ment whereas Mr. Paine is its profe&s;&s;ed enemy; what then? the principle is, that every man, while he obeys the Laws, is to think for him&s;elf, and to conduct him&s;elf as he thinks. The very ends of &s;ociety exact this licence, and the policy of the law, in its provi&s;ions for its &s;ecurity, has tacitly &s;anctioned it. The real fact is, that writings again&s;t a free and well proportioned government, need not be guarded again&s;t by laws. They cannot often exi&s;t, and never with effect. The ju&s;t and awful principles of &s;o|ciety, are rarely brought forward, but when they are in|&s;ulted and denied, or abu&s;ed in practice: Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on Government, we owe to Sir Robert Filmer, as we owe Mr. Paine's to Mr. Burke; and indeed, between the arguments of Filmer and Burke, I &s;ee no e&s;&s;ential dif|ference; &s;ince it is not worth di&s;puting, whether a King exi&s;ts by <HI>Divine</HI> right, or indi&s;&s;oluble <HI>Human</HI> compact, if he exi&s;ts whether we will or no: If his exi&s;tence be with|out our con&s;ent, and to continue without benefit, it matters not a farthing, whether his title be from God or from Man.</P>
<P>That his title is from man, and from every generation of man, without regard to the determination of former ones, hear from Mr. Locke, <HI>"All men"</HI> &s;ay they, (i. e. Filmer and his adherents,) <Q><HI>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a &s;ubject to his father or his prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of &s;ubjec|tion and allegiance,</HI> It is plain, mankind never owned nor con&s;idered any &s;uch natural <HI>&s;ubjection that they were born in,</HI> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own con&s;ents, to a &s;ubjection to them and their heirs.</Q></P>

can no more give away the liberty of the &s;on,</HI> than it can of any body el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>So much for Mr. Locke's opinion of the rights of man|kind. Let us now examine his ideas of the &s;uppo&s;ed dan|ger of tru&s;ting them with them.</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps it will be &s;aid, that the people being igno|rant, and always di&s;contented, to lay the foundation of government in the un&s;teady opinion and uncertain hu|mor of the people, is to expo&s;e it to certain ruin: and no government will be able long to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if the people may &s;et up a new legi&s;lature, whenever they take offence at the old one. To this, I an&s;wer quite the contrary: people are not &s;o ea&s;ily got out of their old forms, as &s;ome are apt to &s;ugge&s;t: they are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame they have been accu&s;tomed to; and if there be any ori|ginal defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption, it is not an ea&s;y thing to be changed, even when all the world &s;ees there is an opportunity for it. This &s;lowne&s;s and aver&s;ion in the people to quit their old con&s;titutions, has in the many revolutions which have been &s;een in this kingdom, in this and former ages, &s;till kept us to, or, after &s;ome interval of fruitle&s;s at|tempts, &s;till brought us back again to our old legi&s;la|tive of king, lords and commons: and whatever provo|cations have made the crown be taken from &s;ome of our princes heads, they never carried the people &s;o far as to place it in another one.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I wi&s;h I had &s;trength to go on with all that is material, but I have read enough, not only to maintain the true principles of government, but to put to &s;hame the narrow &s;y&s;tem of di&s;tru&s;ting the people.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that Mr. Locke went great lengths in his po&s;itions, to beat down the contrary doctrine of divine right, which was then endangering the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. But that cannot be objected to David Hume, who main|tains the &s;ame doctrine; &s;peaking of the Magna Charta in his hi&s;tory, vol ii. Page 88, he &s;ays, <Q>It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the former articles of the great charter, con|tain &s;uch mitigations and explanations of the foedal law, as are rea&s;onable and equitable; and that the latter in|volve all the chief outlines of a legal governments, and

<P>The&s;e authorities are &s;ufficient to re&s;t on, yet I cannot omit Mr. Burke him&s;elf, who is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more di&s;|tinct on the &s;ubject. Speaking, not of the ancient people of England, but of colonies planted almo&s;t within our me|mories, he &s;ays, <Q>If there be one fact in the world per|fectly clear, it is this; 'that the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple of America is wholly aver&s;e to any other than a free government,' and this is indication enough to any ho|ne&s;t &s;tate&s;men, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e. If any a&s;k me what a free government is, I an&s;wer, <HI>That it is what the peo|ple think &s;o; and that they, and not I, are the natural, lawful, and competent judges of this matter.</HI> If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is con&s;i&s;tent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for &s;o great a tru&s;t, and not to endeavor to prove from thence, that they have rea&s;oned ami&s;s, and that having gone &s;o far, by analogy, they mu&s;t hereafter have no enjoyment but by my plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to feel my time con&s;iderably con&s;umed before I am arrived at what I conceive to be the material &s;ubject of your con&s;ideration. For all that I have been &s;tating now is only to &s;hew, that there is not that novelty in the opinions of the defendant, that &s;hould lead you to think that he does not <HI>bona fide</HI> entertain them, much le&s;s when connected with the hi&s;tory of his life, which I therefore brought in review before you. But &s;till the great que&s;tion remains unargued. Had he a right to promulgate the&s;e opinions? Gentlemen, if he entertained them, I &s;hall argue that he had; and although my arguments upon the Liberty of the Pre&s;s may not to-day be honored with your or the court's approbation, I &s;hall retire not at all di&s;heartened, con&s;oling my&s;elf with the reflection, that a &s;eason may arrive for their reception. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential

freedoms of mankind have been but &s;lowly and gradually received, and &s;o very late, indeed do &s;ome of them come to maturity, that notwith&s;tanding the Attorney General tells you that the very que&s;tion I am now agitating is mo&s;t peculi|arly for <HI>your</HI> con&s;ideration, as a Jury, under our <HI>ancient</HI> con&s;titution, yet I mu&s;t remind both you and him, that your juri&s;diction to con&s;ider and deal with it at all in judg|ment, is but <HI>a year old.</HI> When, before that late period, I ventured to maintain this very <HI>right of a Jury</HI> over the que&s;tion of libel under the &s;ame ancient con&s;titution; (I do not mean before my Lord, for the matter was gone to re&s;t in the courts, at lea&s;t long before he came to &s;it where he does.)

<P>Gentlemen, I have in&s;i&s;ted, at great length, upon the origin of government being in the con&s;ent of the people, and detailed the authorities which you have heard upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e, I con&s;ider it to be not only a &s;up|port, but, indeed, the only foundation of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s. If Mr. Burke be right, in <HI>his</HI> principles of go|vernment, I admit that the Pre&s;s, in my &s;en&s;e of its free|dom, ought not to be free, <HI>nor free in any &s;en&s;e at all;</HI> and that all addre&s;&s;es to the people upon the &s;ubject of go|vernment, and all &s;peculations of amendment, of what kind or nature &s;oever, are illegal and criminal: for, if the peo|ple have, without po&s;&s;ible recal, delegated all their au|thorities, they have no juri&s;diction to act, and therefore none to think, upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, and it is a libel to ar|raign Government or any of its acts, before tho&s;e that
<PB N="41" REF="025456_0039_0FCD3F0214B91D60">
have no juri&s;diction to correct them. But on the other hand, as it is a &s;ettled rule in the law of England, that the &s;ubject may always addre&s;s a competent juri&s;diction on ev|ery matter within it, no legal argument can &s;hake the free|dom of the pre&s;s in my &s;en&s;e of it, I am &s;upported in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people, to change or to reform their governments.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is becau&s;e the Liberty of the Pre&s;s re&s;olves it&s;elf into this great i&s;&s;ue, that it has been in every time and country, the la&s;t liberty which &s;ubjects have been able to wre&s;t from power.&mdash;Other liberties are held under governments, but the liberty of opinion keeps governments them&s;elves in due &s;ubjection to their duties. This has pro|duced the martyrdom of truth in every age, and the world has only purged it&s;elf from ignorance with the innocent blood of tho&s;e who have enlightened it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my &s;trength and time are wa&s;ted, and I can only make this melancholy hi&s;tory pa&s;s like a &s;hadow before you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the grand type and example.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al God of nature,&mdash;the Saviour of mankind, the Fountain of all light, who came to pluck the world from eternal darkne&s;s, expired upon a cro&s;s the &s;coff of infidel &s;corn; and his ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles followed him in the train of martyrs. When he came in the fle&s;h, he might have come like the Mahometan prophet, as a powerful &s;overeign, and propagated that religion with an unconquerable &s;word, which even now, after the lap&s;e of ages, is but &s;lowly moving under the influence of rea&s;on, over the face of the earth: But &s;uch a proce&s;s would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with his mi&s;&s;ion, which was to confound the pride, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the univer&s;al rights of men; he came therefore in that lowly &s;tate which is repre&s;ented in the Go&s;pel, and preach|ed his con&s;olations to the poor.</P>
<P>When the foundation of this religion was di&s;covered to be invulnerable and immortal, we find political power taking the church into partner&s;hip; thus began the cor|ruptions both of religion and civil power, and, hand in hand together, what havoc have they not made in the world; ruling by ignorance and the per&s;ecution of truth; but this very per&s;ecution only ha&s;tened the revival of let|ters and liberty, which was to de&s;troy the one and rai&s;e up
<PB N="42" REF="025456_0040_0FCD3F0369BBB740">
the other. Nay, you will find, that in the exact propor|tion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered, they have de&s;troyed the governments that bound them. The court of Star-Chamber, the fir&s;t re&s;tric|tion of the pre&s;s of England, was erected, previous to all the great changes in the con&s;titution. From that moment no man could legally write without an imprimatur from the &s;tate; but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through &s;ecret channels, and the unhappy Charles, unwarned by a free-pre&s;s, was brought to an ig|nominious death.</P>
<P>When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their &s;ufferings, real, or imaginary, their pa&s;&s;ions &s;pend them&s;elves in air, like gun-powder &s;cattered upon the &s;ur|face; but pent up by terrors, they work un&s;een, like &s;ub|terraneous fire, bur&s;t forth in earthquake, and de&s;troy eve|ry thing in their cour&s;e. Let rea&s;on be oppo&s;ed to rea&s;on, and argument to argument, and every good Government will be &s;afe.</P>
<P>The u&s;urper, Cromwell, pur&s;ued the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of re|&s;traint in &s;upport of his Government, and the end of it &s;peedily followed.</P>
<P>At the re&s;toration of Charles the Second, the Star-Cham|ber Ordnance of 1637, was worked up into an Act of Par|liament, and was followed up during that reign, and the &s;hort one that followed it, by the mo&s;t &s;anguinary pro&s;e|cutions; but what fact in hi&s;tory is more notorious, than that this blind and contemptible policy prepared and ha&s;|tened on the Revolution. At that great aera the&s;e cob|webs were all bru&s;hed away: The freedom of the Pre&s;s was regenerated, and the country, ruled by its affections, has &s;ince enjoyed a century of tranquility and glory.&mdash; Thus I have maintained, by Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, that in pro|portion as the pre&s;s has bean free, Engli&s;h government has been &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now &s;upport the &s;ame important truth by every great authorities. Upon a &s;ubject of this kind re&s;ort cannot be had to law ca&s;es. The ancient law of England knew nothing of &s;uch libels; they began, and &s;hould have ended, with the Star-Chamber. What wri|tings are &s;landerous of individuals, mu&s;t be looked for where the&s;e pro&s;ecutions are recorded; but upon general
<PB N="43" REF="025456_0041_0FCD3F06AB0C0500">
&s;ubjects we mu&s;t go to general writers. If, indeed, I were to refer to ob&s;cure authors, I might be an&s;wered, that my very authorities were libels, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifications or ex|amples; but this cannot be &s;aid with effect of great men, who&s;e works are cla&s;&s;ics in our language, taught in our &s;chools, and printed under the eye of government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall begin with the poet Milton, a great authority in all learning.&mdash;It may be &s;aid, indeed, he was a republican, but that would only prove that republicani&s;m is not incompatible with virtue; it may be &s;aid too, that the work which I cite was written again&s;t previous licen|&s;ing, which is not contended for to-day. But, in my opi|nion, if every work is to be adjudged a libel, which is ad|ver&s;e to the wi&s;hes of government, or to the opinions of tho&s;e who may try it, the revival of a licencer would be a &s;ecurity to the public: For, if I pre&s;ent my book to a magi&s;trate appointed by law, if he rejects it, I have only to forbear from the publication, and in the forbearance I am &s;afe; and he too is an&s;werable to law for the abu&s;e of his authority. But, upon the argument of to-day, a man mu&s;t print at his peril, without any guide to the principles of judgment, upon which his work may be afterwards pro&s;e|cuted and condemned. Milton's argument therefore ap|plies, and was meant to apply, to every interruption to writing, which, while they oppre&s;s the individual, endan|ger the &s;tate.</P>
<Q><P>We have them not, &s;ays Milton, that can be heard of, from any ancient &s;tate, or policy, or church, nor by any &s;tatute left us by our ance&s;tors, elder or later, nor from the modern cu&s;tom of any reformed city, or church abroad; but from the mo&s;t antichri&s;tian council, and the mo&s;t tyrannous inqui&s;ition that ever exi&s;ted. Till then, books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; <HI>the i&s;&s;ue of the brain was no more &s;tifled than the i&s;&s;ue of the womb.</HI></P>
<P>To the pure, all things are pure: not only meats and drinks, but all kind of knowledge whether good or evil; the knowledge cannot defile nor con&s;equently the books, if the will and con&s;cience be not defiled.</P>
<P>Bad books &s;erve in many re&s;pects to di&s;cover, to confute, to forewarn, and to illu&s;trate. Whereof, what better witne&s;s can we expect I &s;hould produce, than one

<P>Opinions and under&s;tanding are not &s;uch wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and &s;tatutes, and &s;tandards. We mu&s;t not think to make a &s;taple com|modity of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and licence it like our broad cloth and our woolpacks.</P>
<P>Nor is it to the common people le&s;s than a reproach; for if we be &s;o jealous over them that we cannot tru&s;t them with an Engli&s;h pamphlet, what do we but cen&s;ure them for a giddy, vicious, and ungrounded people; in &s;uch a &s;ick and weak e&s;tate of faith and di&s;cretion, as to be able to take nothing down, but through the pipe of a licen&s;er. That this is care or love of them we cannot pretend.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e corruptions which it &s;eeks to prevent, break in fa&s;ter at doors which cannot be &s;hut.</P>
<P>To prevent men thinking and acting for them&s;elves, by re&s;traints on the pre&s;s, is like to the exploits of that gallant man, who, thought to pound up the crows, by &s;hutting his park gate.</P>
<P>This ob&s;tructing violence meets for the mo&s;t part with an event, utterly oppo&s;ite to the end which it drives at: in&s;tead of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing books, it rai&s;es them and inve&s;ts them with a reputation: the puni&s;hment of wits enhances their authority, &s;aith the Vi&s;count St. Albans'; and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain &s;park of truth, that flies up in the face of them who &s;eek to tread it out.</P></Q>
<P>He then adverts to his vi&s;it to the famous Galileo, whom he found and vi&s;ited in the inqui&s;ition, <Q>for not thinking in a&s;tronomy with the Franci&s;can and Dominican Monks.</Q> And what event ought more deeply to inte|re&s;t and affect us. The very laws of nature were to bend under the rod of a licen&s;er; this illu&s;trious a&s;tronomer end|ed his life within the bars of a pri&s;on, becau&s;e, in &s;eeing the
<PB N="45" REF="025456_0043_0FCD3F0AF6EEE978">
pha&s;es of Venus thro' his newly-invented tele&s;cope, he pronounced, that &s;he &s;hone with borrowed light, and from the Sun as the centre of the univer&s;e. This was the migh|ty crime, the placing the &s;un in the centre: that &s;un which now inhabits it upon the foundation of mathematical truth, which enables us to traver&s;e the pathle&s;s ocean, and to carry our line and rule among&s;t other worlds: which but for Ga|lileo we had never known, perhaps even to the rece&s;&s;es of an infinite and immortal God.</P>
<P>Milton then, in his mo&s;t eloquent addre&s;s to the Parlia|ment, puts the liberty of the pre&s;s on its true and mo&s;t ho|norable foundation; <Q>Believe it, Lords and Commons, they who coun&s;el ye to &s;uch a &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of books, do as good as bid you &s;uppre&s;s your&s;elves; and I will &s;oon &s;hew how.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it be de&s;ired to know the immediate cau&s;e of all this free writing and free &s;peaking, there cannot be a&s;&s;igned a truer than your own mild, and free and humane government; it is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your own valorous and happy coun&s;els have pur|cha&s;ed us; liberty which is the nur&s;e of all great wits: this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our &s;pi|rits like the influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchi&s;ed, enlarged, and lifted up our apprehen&s;ions, degrees above them&s;elves. Ye cannot make us now le&s;s capable, le&s;s knowing, le&s;s eagerly pur&s;uing the truth, unle&s;s ye fir&s;t make your&s;elves, that made us &s;o, le&s;s the lovers, le&s;s the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant again, bruti&s;h, formal, and &s;lavi&s;h, as ye found us; but you then mu&s;t fir&s;t become that which ye cannot be, oppre&s;&s;ive, arbitrary, and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the &s;earch and expectation of greate&s;t and ex|acte&s;t things, is the i&s;&s;ue of your own virtue propagated in us. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely, according to con&s;cience above all liberties.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now refer you to another author, who&s;e opinion you may think more in point, as having li|ved in our own times, and as holding the highe&s;t monar|chical principles of government. I &s;peak of Mr. Hume, who, neverthele&s;s, con&s;iders, that this liberty of the pre&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="025456_0044_0FCD3F0DA3294C08">
extends not only to ab&s;tract &s;peculation, but to keep the public on their gourd again&s;t all the acts of their govern|ment.</P>
<P>After &s;hewing the advantages of a monarchy to public freedom, provided it is duty controlled and watched by the popular part of the con&s;titution, he &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e prin|ciples account for the great liberty of the pre&s;s in the&s;e kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other govern|ment. It is apprehended, that arbitrary power would &s;teal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its pro|gre&s;s, and were there not an ea&s;y method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. <HI>The &s;pirit of the people mu&s;t frequently be rou&s;ed, in or|der to curb the ambition of the court;</HI> and the dread of rou&s;ing this &s;pirit mu&s;t be employed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is &s;o effectual to this purpo&s;e as the liberty of the pre&s;s, by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the nation, may be employed on the &s;ide of freedom, and every one be animated to its defence. AS LONG, THEREFORE, AS THE REPUBLICAN PART OF OUR GOVERNMENT CAN MAINTAIN ITSELF A|GAINST THE MONARCHICAL, IT WILL NATURAL|LY BE CAREFUL TO KEEP THE PRESS OPEN, AS OF IMPORTANCE TO ITS OWN PRESERVATION.</Q></P>
<P>There is another authority co-temporary with the la&s;t, a &s;plendid &s;peaker in the upper Hou&s;e of Parliament, and who held during mo&s;t of his time, high offices under the King; I &s;peak of the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who thos expre&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of Lords:&mdash;<Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, my Lords, we enjoy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil&mdash;Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of Liberty, it is&mdash;.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Er&s;kine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, I believe it was &s;o, and I
<PB N="47" REF="025456_0045_0FCD3F0ECED71280">
am much obliged to his Lord&s;hip for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine. For though Lord Che&s;terfield was a man of great ingenuity and wit, he was undoubtedly far inferior in learning and in monarchical opinion, to the celebrated writer to whom my Lord has now delivered the work by his authority. Doctor John|&s;on then &s;ays, <Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people, my Lords, can en|joy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil: Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of Liberty: It is an ebullition, an excre&s;cence; it is a &s;peck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle, with a trembling hand, le&s;t I de&s;troy the body, le&s;t I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P><Q>There is &s;uch a connection between licentiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to correct the one without dangerou&s;ly wounding the other; it is extremely hard to di&s;tingui&s;h the true limit between them; like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two different colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where the one ends, or where the other begins.</Q></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I cannot help agreeing with this learned au|thor. The danger of touching the pre&s;s is the difficulty of marking its limits. My learned friend, who has ju&s;t gone out of court, has drawn no line, and unfolded no principle. He has not told us, if this book is condemned, what book may be written. If I may not write again&s;t the exi&s;tence of a monarchy, and recommend a republic, may I write again&s;t any part of the Government? May I &s;ay that we &s;hould be better without a Hou&s;e of Lords, or a Hou&s;e of Commons, or a Court of Chancery, or any other given part of our e&s;tabli&s;hment? Or if, as has been hinted, a work may be|come libellous for &s;tating even legal matter with &s;arca&s;tic phra&s;e, the difficulty becomes the greater, and the liberty of the pre&s;s more impo&s;&s;ible to define.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author pur&s;uing the &s;ubject and &s;peaking of the fall of Roman liberty, &s;ays, <Q>But this &s;ort of liberty came &s;oon after to be called licentiou&s;ne&s;s; for we are told that Augu&s;tus, after having e&s;tabli&s;hed his empire, re&s;tored order in Rome by re&s;training licentiou&s;ne&s;s. God forbid we &s;hould in this country have order re&s;to|red
<PB N="48" REF="025456_0046_0FCD3F133164A740">
or licentiou&s;ne&s;s re&s;trained, at &s;o dear a rate as the People of Rome paid for it to Augu&s;tus.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Let us con&s;ider, my Lords, that arbitrary power has &s;eldom or never been introduced into any country at once. It mu&s;t be introduced by &s;low degrees, and as it were &s;tep by &s;tep, le&s;t the people &s;hould &s;ee its approach. The barriers and fences of the people's liberty mu&s;t be plucked up one by one, and &s;ome plau&s;ible pretences mu&s;t be found for removing, or hood-winking one after another, tho&s;e &s;entries who are po&s;ted by the con&s;titution of a free country, for warning the people of their danger. When the&s;e preparatory &s;teps are once made, the people then, indeed, with regret, &s;ee &s;lavery and arbitrary pow|er making long &s;trides over their land; but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impend|ing ruin.</P>
<P>The &s;tage, my Lords, and the pre&s;s, are two of our out-&s;entries; if we remove them, if we hood-wink them, if we throw them in fetters, the enemy may &s;urpri&s;e us.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;ubject was &s;till more lately put in the ju&s;te&s;t and the mo&s;t forcible light by a noble per&s;on high in the Magi&s;tracy; and who&s;e mind is not at all tuned to the introduction of di&s;order by improper popular ex|ce&s;&s;es; I mean Lord Loughborough, Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of Common Pleas. I believe I can an&s;wer the cor|rectne&s;s of my note, which I &s;hall follow up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's Hou&s;e of Par|liament; the pre&s;ent Earl Stanhope; or rather, I &s;hall take Lord Stanhope fir&s;t, as his Lord&s;hip introduces the &s;ubject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughbo|rough's. "If," &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, <Q>our boa&s;ted liberty of the pre&s;s, were to con&s;i&s;t only in the liberty to write in prai&s;e of the Con&s;titution, this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments. I &s;uppo&s;e it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offence, even by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, if any man were to take into his head to write a panegyric upon the Ru&s;&s;ian form of Government. Such a liberty as that might therefore properly be termed the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian. Liberty of the Pre&s;s. But, the Engli&s;h Liberty of the Pre&s;s</HI> is of a very differ|ent de&s;cription: for, by the law of England, it is not
<PB N="49" REF="025456_0047_0FCD3F14A885F278">
prohibited to publi&s;h &s;peculative works upon the Con|&s;titution, whether <HI>they contain prai&s;e or cen&s;ure.&mdash;</HI></Q></P>
<P>[Lord Stanhope's defence of the Libel Bill.]</P>
<P>You &s;ee therefore, as far as the general principles go, I am &s;upported by the opinion of Lord Stanhope, for otherwi&s;e the noble Lord has written a libel him&s;elf, by exciting other people to write <HI>whatever they may think,</HI> be it good or evil, of the con&s;titution of the country. As to the other high authority, Lord Loughborough, I will read what applies to this &s;ubject&mdash;"Every man," &s;aid Lord Loughborough, <Q>may publi&s;h at his di&s;cretion his opinions concerning forms and &s;y&s;tems of Government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If they be wi&s;e and enlightening, the world will gain by them; if they be weak and ab&s;urd, they will be laughed at and forgotten; and, if they be <HI>bona fide,</HI> they cannot be criminal, however erroneous. On the other hand, the purpo&s;e and the direction may give a different turn to writings who&s;e common con&s;truction is harmle&s;s or even meritorious. Suppo&s;e men, a&s;&s;embled in di&s;turbance of the peace, to pull down mills or turn-pikes, or to do any other mi&s;chief, and that a mi&s;chiev|ous per&s;on &s;hould di&s;per&s;e among them an excitation to the planned mi&s;chief known to both writer and reader, <HI>To your tents, O I&s;rael;</HI> that publication would be criminal. But how criminal? Not as a libel, not as an ab&s;tract writing, but as an act; and the act being the crime, <HI>it mu&s;t be &s;tated as a fact extrin&s;ic on the record:</HI> for, otherwi&s;e, a Court of Error could have no juri&s;dic|tion but over the natural con&s;truction of the writing; nor would the defendant have any notice of &s;uch matter at the trial, without a charge on the record. To give the Jury cognizance of any matter beyond the con&s;tructi|on of the writing, the averment &s;hould be in the ca&s;e as I have in&s;tanced, that certain per&s;ons were, as I have de|&s;cribed, a&s;&s;embled; and that the publi&s;her, intending to execute the&s;e per&s;ons &s;o a&s;&s;embled, wrote <HI>&s;o and &s;o.</HI> Here the crime is complete, and con&s;i&s;ts in an overt act of wickedne&s;s evidenced by a writing.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to all the&s;e authorities, the Attorney-General may &s;ay, that, if Mr. Paine had written his ob&s;ervations with the views of tho&s;e high per&s;ons and under other cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="50" REF="025456_0048_0FCD3F175E3EA148">
he would be protected and acquitted: to which I can only an&s;wer, that no facts or circum&s;tances attending his work, are either charged or proved; that you have no juri&s;diction whatever but over the natural con&s;truction of the work before you, and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the pa&s;&s;ages which are the particular &s;ubject of complaint.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am not unmindful how long I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon your patience; and, recollecting the nature of the human mind, and how much, for a thou&s;and rea&s;ons, I have to &s;truggle again&s;t at this moment, I &s;hall not be di&s;concerted if any of you &s;hould appear anxious to retire from the pain of hearing me farther. It has been &s;aid, that my vanity has forwarded my zeal in this cau&s;e; but I might appeal even to the authors of tho&s;e paragraphs, whe|ther a &s;ituation ever exi&s;ted which vanity would have been fonder to fly from&mdash;the ta&s;k of &s;peaking again&s;t every known prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; with every countenance, as it were, planted and lifted up again&s;t me. But I &s;tand at this bar to give to a criminal arraigned before it, the defence which the law of the country entitles him to. If any of my ar|guments be indecent, or unfit for the Court to hear, the noble judge pre&s;ides to interrupt them: If all, or any of them, are capable of an an&s;wer, they will be an&s;wered: Or, if they be &s;o unfounded in your own minds, who are to judge of them as not to call for refutation, your verdict in a moment will overthrow all that has been &s;aid&mdash;We &s;hall then have all di&s;charged our duties&mdash;It is your's to judge, but mine only to addre&s;s your judgments.</P>
<P>When my Lord and I were Coun&s;el for Lord George Gordon in 1781, it was not con&s;idered by that Jury, nor im|puted to us by any body, that we were contending for the privileges of over-awing the Hou&s;e of Commons, or re|commending the conflagration of this city: I am doing the &s;ame duty now, which MY LORD AND I then did in concert together; and, whatever may become of the cau&s;e, I expect to be heard: con&s;cious that no ju&s;t obloquy can be, or will <HI>(in the end)</HI> be ca&s;t upon me for having done my duty in the manner I have endeavoured to perform it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I come now to ob&s;erve on the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elec|ted by the information; and with regard to the fir&s;t, I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it in a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="025456_0049_0FCD3F186BB7F4A0"><Q>All <HI>Hereditary</HI> government is in its nature tyranny. An hereditable crown, or an hereditable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are hereditable <HI>property.</HI> To <HI>inherit</HI> a government is to <HI>inherit</HI> the <HI>people,</HI> as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>And is it to be endured, &s;ays the Attorney General, that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or &s;heep? Certainly not. I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be in&s;tilled into the peo|ple of England. But who in&s;tills &s;uch a doctrine? I deny it is in&s;tilled by Paine. For when he mantains that heredit|ary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds, it is clear from the context <HI>(which is kept out of view,)</HI> that he is combating the propo&s;ition in Mr. Burke's book, which a&s;&s;erts, that the hereditary monarchy of England is fa&s;tened upon the people of England by indi&s;&s;oluble compact. Mr. Paine, on the contrary, a&s;&s;erts the King of England to be the <HI>magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> exi&s;ting by their con&s;ent, which is utterly incompatible with their being driven like herds. His argument, therefore, is this, and it retorts on his ad|ver&s;ary: he &s;ays, &s;uch a King as you repre&s;ent the King of England to be, inheriting the people by virtue of con|que&s;t, or of &s;ome compact, which, having once exi&s;ted, cannot be di&s;&s;olved while the original terms of it are kept, <HI>is an inheritance like flocks and herds.</HI> But I deny that to be the King of England's title, he is <HI>the magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> and that title I re&s;pect. It is to your own imagi|nary King of England therefore, and not to his Maje&s;ty, that your unfounded inuendos apply. It is the monarchs of Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia, and all governments fa&s;tened upon unwilling &s;ubjects by hereditary indefea&s;ible titles that are &s;tigmati&s;ed by Paine as inheriting the people like flocks. The &s;entence, therefore, mu&s;t either be taken in the pure ab&s;tract, and then it is not only merely &s;peculative, but the application of it to our own government fails altogether, or it mu&s;t be taken connected with the matter which con&s;ti|tutes the application, and then it is Mr. Burke's King of England, and not his Maje&s;ty, who&s;e title is denied.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s therefore to the next pa&s;&s;age, which appears to be an extraordinary &s;election. It is taken at a leap from page 21 to page 47, and breaks in at the words, "This Con|vention."
<PB N="52" REF="025456_0050_0FCD3F1B1ADDEE00">
The &s;entence &s;elected &s;tands thus, <Q>This con|vention met at Philadelphia, in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time conected with any of the &s;tate governments, or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The convention went deeply into all the &s;ubjects: and having after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, they did not, like a cabal of cour|tiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elec|tor; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</P></Q>
<P>This &s;entence &s;tanding by it&s;elf, may appear to be a mere &s;arca&s;m on King William, upon tho&s;e who affected the Revolution; and upon the revolution itself, without any rea&s;oning or deduction: But when the context and &s;e|quel are looked at and compared, it will appear to be a &s;eri|ous hi&s;torical compari&s;on between the Revolution effected in England in 1688, and the late one in America when &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed her independence; and no man can doubt that his judgment on that compari&s;on was &s;incere. But where is the libel on the con&s;titution? For whether King William was brought over here by the &s;incere&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t motives of the whole people of England, each man acting for himself, or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant, it &s;ignifies not one farthing at this time of day to the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf. Black&s;tone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the government on the motives of our ance&s;tors, or the rectitude of their reason|ings, but to be &s;atisfied that it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is &s;afe rea&s;oning, and for my own part, I &s;hould not be differently affected to the con&s;titution of my country, which my own under&s;tanding approved, whether angels or daemons had gi|ven it birth.</P>
<P>Do any of you love the reformation the le&s;s becau&s;e Henry the Eighth was the author of it? Or becau&s;e lu&s;t and poverty and not religion, were his motives. He had &s;quandered the trea&s;ures of his father, and he preferred
<PB N="53" REF="025456_0051_0FCD3F1C2D85D6D0">
Anne Bullen to his Queen; the&s;e were the cau&s;es which produced it. What then! does that affect the purity of our reformed religion, undermine its e&s;tabli&s;hment, or &s;hake the King's title as prince of the country, to the ex|clu&s;ion of tho&s;e who held by the religion it had aboli&s;hed? Will the Attorney General affirm, that I could be convict|ed of a libel for a whole volume of a&s;perity again&s;t Henry the Eighth, merely becau&s;e he effected the reformation; and if not, why again&s;t King William, who effected the Revolution? Where is the line to be drawn? Is one, two, or three centuries to be the &s;tatute of limitation? But do not our own hi&s;torians detail this very cabal of courtiers, from the records of our own country? If you will turn to Hume's hi&s;tory, volume the eighth, page 188, &amp;c. &amp;c. you will find that he &s;tates at great length, the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the Revolution, and the intere&s;ted coalition of parties which gave it effect.</P>
<P>But what of all this, concerning the motives of parties, which is recorded by Hume. The que&s;tion is, <HI>What is the thing brought about,&mdash;Not</HI> HOW <HI>it was brought about.</HI> If it &s;tands, as Black&s;tone argues it, upon the con&s;ent of our ance&s;tors, followed up by our own, no individual can with|draw his obedience. If he di&s;likes the e&s;tabli&s;hment, let him &s;eek el&s;ewhere for another; I am not contending for uncontrolled <HI>conduct,</HI> but for freedom of <HI>opinion.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to what has been &s;tated of the <HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henrys,</HI> and the other princes under which the author can only di&s;cover <HI>"re&s;trictions on power, but nothing of a con|&s;titution:"</HI> &s;urely my friend is not in earne&s;t when he &s;e|lects that as a libel.</P>

<P>Was the&s;e any freedom after the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Normans by conque&s;t? Was not the MAGNA CHAR|TA wre&s;ted from John by open force of arms at Runny-mead?

Parliament, upon the firm demand of the people in the fol|lowing reigns? I prote&s;t it fills me with a&s;toni&s;hment to hear the&s;e truths brought in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I was formerly called upon under the di&s;cipline of a col|lege to mantain them, and was rewarded for being thought to have &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained that our pre&s;ent con&s;titution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty, nor any other in&s;titution of liberty, but the pure con&s;equence of the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Norman tenures, which &s;preading the &s;pirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to another, ena|bled our brave fathers, inch by inch, not to re-conquer, <HI>but for the first time to obtain</HI> tho&s;e privileges which are the unalienable inheritance of all mankind.</P>
<P>But why do we &s;peak of the Edwards and Henrys when Hume him&s;elf expre&s;sly &s;ays, notwith&s;tanding all we have heard to day of the antiquity of our con&s;titution, that our monarchy was nearly ab&s;olute till the middle of la&s;t cen|tury. I have his book in court, and will read it to you. It is his e&s;&s;ay on the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, vol. I, page 15.</P>
<P><Q>All ab&s;olute Governments, and &s;uch in a great mea|&s;ure was England, till the middle of la&s;t century. <HI>notwith&s;tanding the numerous panegyrics on</HI> ANCIENT <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty,</HI> mu&s;t very much depend on the admini|&s;tration.</Q></P>
<P>This is Hume's opinion; the conclu&s;ion of a grave hi&s;|torian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for hi&s;tory: and &s;hall it be &s;aid that Mr. Paine is to be puni&s;h|ed for writing to-day what was before written by another, who is now a di&s;tingui&s;hed cla&s;&s;ic in the language? All the verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public, or to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age arraigned is this: p. 56. <Q>The attenti|on of the government of England, (for I rather cha&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h government) appears &s;ince its political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>That the government of this country has, in con&s;equence of its connection with the continent, and the continental

wars which it has occa&s;ioned, been continually loaded with grievous taxes no man can di&s;pute; and I appeal to your ju&s;tice, whether this &s;ubject has not been, for years toge|ther, the con&s;tant topic of unreproved declamation and grum|bling?</P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays with regard to there hardly being &s;uch a thing as regular law, he &s;peaks in the ab&s;tract of the complexity of our &s;y&s;tem; but does not arraign the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice <HI>in its practice.</HI> But with regard to critici&s;m and &s;trictures on the general &s;y&s;tem, it has been echoed over and over again by various authors; and even from the pulpits of our country, that the law of the land is mainly defective, devoid of regularity and preci&s;ion, and overloaded with a variety of expen&s;ive and unnece&s;&s;ary forms. I have a Sermon in Court written during the Ame|rican war, by a per&s;on of great eloquence and piety, part of which I will read to you on this &s;ubject, in which he looks forward to an exemption from the intolerable griev|ances of our old legal &s;y&s;tem in the infant e&s;tabli&s;hment of the New World.</P>
<P><Q>It may be in the purpo&s;es of Providence, on you we&s;t|ern &s;hores, to rai&s;e the bulwark of a purer reformation than ever Britain patroni&s;ed; to found a le&s;s burthen|&s;ome, more au&s;picious, &s;table, and incorruptible govern|ment than ever Britain has enjoyed; and to e&s;tabli&s;h there a &s;y&s;tem of law more ju&s;t and &s;imple in its princi|ples, le&s;s intricate, dubious and dilatory in its proceed|ings, more mild and equitable in its &s;anctions, more ea&s;y and more certain in its execution; wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him, or want ju&s;tice through poverty or weakne&s;s, or e&s;cape it by legal artifice, or civil privileges, or interpo&s;ing power; wherein the rule of conduct &s;hall not be hidden or di&s;|gui&s;ed in the language of principles and cu&s;toms that died with the barbari&s;m which gave them birth; where|in ha&s;ty formulas &s;hall not di&s;&s;ipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and tran&s;actions of ju&s;tice: where|in ob&s;olete prescripts &s;hall not pervert, nor entangle, nor impede the admini&s;tration of it, nor in any in&s;tance ex|po&s;e it to deri&s;ion or di&s;regard; wherein mi&s;repre&s;en|tation &s;hall have no &s;hare in deciding upon right and truth; and under which no man &s;hall grow greatly the

wages of chicanery, or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers.</Q></P>
<P>This is ten times &s;tronger than Mr. Paine; but who ever thought of pro&s;ecuting Mr. Cappe?</P>
<P>In various other in&s;tances you will find defects in our juri&s;prudence pointed out and lamented, and not &s;eldom by per&s;ons called upon by their &s;ituations to deliver the law in the &s;eat of magi&s;tracy: therefore the author's <HI>gene|ral</HI> ob&s;ervation does not appear to be that &s;pecies of attack upon the magi&s;tracy of the country, as to fall within the de&s;cription of a libel.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, I believe I &s;hall be able to &s;hew you that the very per&s;on who intro|duced this controver&s;y, and who certainly is con&s;idered by tho&s;e who now admini&s;ter the government, as a man u&s;efully devoted to maintain the con&s;titution of the country in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, has him&s;elf made remarks upon the&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies; that upon compari&s;on you will think more &s;evere than tho&s;e which are the &s;ubject of the Attorney General's animadver&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;age in Mr. Paine runs thus:</P>
<Q><P>With re&s;pect to <HI>the two Hou&s;es,</HI> of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually in|fluenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature, to have no tem|per of its own. The mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedience.</P>
<P>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two Hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nick-named Hou&s;e regarded, that the peo|ple &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It ap|pears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the further&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</P></Q>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, and which was meant by Paine as evidence of the previous a&s;&s;ertion, the Attor|ney General has omitted in the information, and in his &s;peech, it is this: <Q>In the debate on engaging in the Ru&s;&s;ian and Turki&s;h war, the majority in the Hou&s;e of Peers in favor of it was upwards of ninety, when in the
<PB N="57" REF="025456_0055_0FCD3F27C10E7E18">
other Hou&s;e, which is more than double its numbers, the majority was &s;ixty-three.</Q></P>
<P>The terms, however, in which Mr. Bruke &s;peaks of the Hou&s;e of Lords, are &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive. <Q>It is &s;ome|thing more than a century ago, &s;ince we voted the Hou&s;e of Lords u&s;ele&s;s. They have now voted them&s;elves &s;o, and the whole hope of reformation</Q> <HI>(&s;peaking of the Hou&s;e of Commons)</HI> "is ca&s;t upon us." This &s;entiment, Mr. Burke not only expre&s;&s;ed in his place in parliament, where no man can call him to an account; but it has been &s;ince, repeatedly printed among&s;t his other valuable works. And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIA|MENT, which I am about to read to you, was originally publi&s;hed as a pamphlet, and applied to the &s;ettled habi|tual abu&s;es of the&s;e high a&s;&s;emblies. Remember I do not u&s;e them as <HI>argumenta ad hominem,</HI> or <HI>ad individiam</HI> again&s;t the author, for if I did, it could be no defence of Mr. Paine. But I u&s;e them as high authority, the work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. BURKE'S thoughts on the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;con|tents, publi&s;hed in 1775.</NOTE> having been the ju&s;t foundation of &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting reputation. Would to God that any part of it were capa|ble of being denied or doubted.</P>
<Q><P>Again&s;t the being of parliament I am &s;atisfied no de|&s;igns have ever been entertained &s;ince the Revolution. Every one mu&s;t perceive that it it &s;trongly the intere&s;t of the Court to have &s;ome &s;econd cau&s;e interpo&s;ed be|tween the mini&s;ters and the people. The gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons have an intere&s;t equally &s;trong, in &s;u&s;taining the part of that intermediate cau&s;e. How|ever they may hire out the <HI>u&s;ufruct</HI> of their voices, they never will part with the <HI>&s;ee and inheritance.</HI> Ac|cordingly tho&s;e who have been of the mo&s;t known de|votion to the will and plea&s;ure of a court, have at the &s;ame time been mo&s;t forward in a&s;&s;erting an high autho|rity in the Hou&s;e of Commons. <HI>When they knew who were to u&s;e that authority, and how it was to be employ|ed, they thought it never could be carried too far.</HI> It mu&s;t be always the wi&s;h of an uncon&s;titutional &s;tate&s;man, that an Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>who are entirely dependent upon him, &s;hould have every right of the people depend|ent upon their pleasure.</HI> FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED
<PB N="58" REF="025456_0056_0FCD3F2928B4F5A0">
THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE, AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, WERE THINGS NOT ALTOGETHER INCOMPATIBLE.</P>
<P>The power of the crown, almo&s;t dead and rotten as Prerogative has grown up anew, with much more &s;trength and far le&s;s odium, under the name of influence. An influence which operates without noi&s;e and violence; which converts the very antagoni&s;t into the in&s;trument of power; which contains in it&s;elf a perpetual principle of growth and renovation; and which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the pro&s;perity of the country equally tend to augment, was an admirable &s;ub&s;titute for a prerogative, that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices, had moul|ded in its original &s;lamina irre&s;i&s;tible principles of de|cay and di&s;&s;olution. The ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary &s;y&s;tem; but the intere&s;t of active men in the &s;tate is a foundation perpetual and in|fallible.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Burke therefore, in page 66, &s;peaking of the &s;ame court party, &s;ays:</P>
<P><Q>Parliament was indeed the great object of all the&s;e po|litics, the end at which they aimed, as well as the IN|STRUMENT by which they were to operate.</Q></P>
<P>And pur&s;uing the &s;ubject in p. 70, proceeds as follows:</P>
<Q><P>They who will not conform their conduct to the pub|lic good, and cannot &s;upport it by the prerogative of the crown, have adopted a new plan. They have totally a|bandoned the &s;hattered and old fa&s;hioned fortre&s;s of pre|rogative, and made a lodgment in the &s;trong hold of par|liament it&s;elf. If they have any evil de&s;ign to which there is no ordinary legal power commen&s;urate, they bring it into parliament. <HI>There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. And the power of obtain|ing their object ab&s;olute; and the &s;afety in the proceed|ing perfect; no rules to confine, nor after reckonings to terrify.</HI> For parliament cannot with any great pro|priety puni&s;h others for things in which they them&s;elves have been ACCOMPLICES. Thus its controul upon the executory power is lo&s;t; becau&s;e it is made to partake in every con&s;iderable act of government, <HI>and impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the Con&s;titution, is in danger of being lo&s;t even to the idea of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="025456_0057_0FCD3F2EE3AF3160">Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an A&s;&s;embly, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t honors and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is rever&s;ed; and the favor of the court is the only &s;ure way of obtaining and hold|ing tho&s;e honors which ought to be IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE PEOPLE.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Burke, in page 100, ob&s;erves with great truth, that the mi&s;chiefs he complained of, did not at all ari&s;e from the monarchy, but from the parliament, and that it was the duty of the people to look to it. He &s;ays, <Q>The di&s;tem|pers of monarchy were the great &s;ubjects of apprehen&s;ion and redre&s;s, in the <HI>la&s;t century; in this,</HI> the di&s;tempers of parliament.</Q></P>
<P>Not the di&s;tempers of parliament in this year or the last, but in <HI>this century,</HI> i. e. its &s;ettled habitual di&s;temper. <Q>It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parlia|mentary di&s;orders can be completed; and hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the people ought to be <HI>excited</HI> to a more &s;trict and detailed attention to the conduct of their repre&s;entatives. Standards for judging more &s;y&s;temati|cally upon their their conduct ought to be &s;ettled in the meetings of counties and corporations, and frequent and correct li&s;ts of the voters in all important que&s;tions ought to be procured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By &s;uch means &s;omething may be done, &s;ince it may appear who tho&s;e are, that by an indi&s;criminate &s;upport of all admini&s;trations, have totally bani&s;hed all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings; have con|founded the be&s;t men with the wor&s;t; and weakened and di&s;&s;olved, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening and compacting the general frame of government.</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was po&s;&s;ible to read the whole of this mo&s;t im|portant volume&mdash;but the con&s;equences of the&s;e truths con|tained in it were all eloquently &s;ummed up by the author in his &s;peech upon the reform of the hou&s;hold.</P>
<P><Q>But what I confe&s;s was uppermo&s;t with me, what I bent the whole cour&s;e of my mind to, was the reduction of that corrupt influence which is it&s;elf the perennial &s;pring of all prodigality and di&s;order; which loads us more than millions of debt; which takes away vigor

from our arms; wi&s;dom from our councils; and every &s;hadow of authority and credit from the mo&s;t venerable parts of our con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame important truths were held out to the whole public, upon a &s;till later occa&s;ion, by the per&s;on now at the head of his Maje&s;ty's councils; and &s;o high (as it appears) in the confidence of the nation. <HI>He,</HI> not in the ab&s;tract like the author before you, but upon the &s;pur of the occa&s;i|on, and in the teeth of what had been ju&s;t declared in the Hou&s;e of Commons, came to, and acted upon re&s;olutions which are contained in this book.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. ERSKINE took up a book</NOTE> Re&s;olutions pointed to the purification of a parliament, dangerou&s;ly corrupted into the very &s;tate de&s;cribed by Mr. Paine. Remember here too, that I impute no cen&s;ure to Mr. Pitt. It was the mo&s;t brilliant pa&s;&s;age in his life, and I &s;hould have thought his life a better one, if he had continued uniform in the &s;upport of opinions, which it is &s;aid he has not changed, and which certainly have had nothing to change them. But at all events, I have a right to make u&s;e of the authority of his &s;plendid talents and &s;ituation, not merely to protect the defendant, but the public, and to re&s;i&s;t the precedent. That what one man may do in England with approbation and glory, &s;hall conduct another man to a pillory or a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>It was the abu&s;es pointed out by the man before you, that led that Right Hon. Gentleman to a&s;&s;ociate with many others of high rank, under the banners of the Duke of Rich|mond, who&s;e name &s;tands at the head of the li&s;t; and to pa&s;s various public re&s;olutions, concerning the ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity of purifying the Hou&s;e of Commons; and we col|lect the plan from a preamble entered in the book, <Q>Whereas the life, liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives, and every man is bound to pay obedience to the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<Q><P>And whereas, by the con&s;titution of this kingdom, the right of making laws is ve&s;ted in three e&s;tates, of King, Lords, and Commons, in parliament a&s;&s;embled, and the con&s;ent of all the three &s;aid e&s;tates, comprehending the whole community, is nece&s;&s;ary to make laws to bind the whole community. And whereas the Hou&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="025456_0059_0FCD3F3376D99C58">
of Commons repre&s;ents all the Commons of the realm, and the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Commons binds the con&s;ent of all the Commons of the realm, and in all ca&s;es on which the legi&s;lature is competent to decide.</P>
<P>And whereas no man is, or can be actually repre&s;ent|ed, who hath not a vote in the election of his repre&s;en|tative.</P>
<P>And whereas it is the right of every commoner of this realm (infants, per&s;ons of in&s;ane mind, and crimi|nals incapacitated by law, only excepted) to have a vote in the election of the repre&s;entative who is to give his con&s;ent to the making of laws by which he is to be bound.</P>
<P>And whereas the number of per&s;ons who are &s;uffered to vote for electing the members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, do not at this time amount to one-&s;ixth part of the whole commons of this realm, whereby far the great|er part of the &s;aid Commons are deprived of their right to elect their repre&s;entatives; and the con&s;ent of the majority of the whole community to the pa&s;&s;ing of laws, is given by per&s;ons whom they have not delegated for &s;uch purpo&s;es; and the majority of the &s;aid community, and to which the &s;aid majority have not in fact con&s;ented by them&s;elves or by their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>And whereas the &s;tate of election of members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, hath in proce&s;s of time &s;o gro&s;sly deviated from its &s;imple and natural principle of repre|&s;entation and equality, that in &s;everal places, the mem|bers are returned by the property of one man; that the &s;malle&s;t boroughs &s;end as many members as the large&s;t counties, and that a majority of the repre&s;entatives of the whole nation are cho&s;en by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thou&s;and.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e with many others, were publi&s;hed, not as ab|&s;tract, &s;peculative writings, but within a few days af|ter the Hou&s;e of Commons had declared that no &s;uch rights exi&s;ted, and that no alteration was nece&s;&s;ary in the repre&s;entation. It was then that they met at the Thatched Hou&s;e, and publi&s;hed their opinions and re&s;olu|tions to the country at large.&mdash;Were any of them pro&s;ecu|ted for the&s;e proceedings?

legal proceedings.) But I de&s;ire you as men of honor and truth, to compare all this with Mr. Paine's expre&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;ter's touching Parliament with his opiate wand, and let equal ju&s;tice be done&mdash;that is all I a&s;k&mdash;let all be pun|i&s;hed or none&mdash;do not let Mr. Paine be held out to the contempt of the public upon the &s;core of his ob&s;ervations on parliament, while others are enjoying all the &s;weets which attend a &s;uppo&s;ed attachment to their country, who have &s;aid the &s;ame things, and reduced their opinions to practice.</P>
<P>But now every man is to be cried down for &s;uch opini|ons. I ob&s;erved that my learned friend &s;ignificantly rai&s;ed his voice in naming Mr. Horne Tooke, as if to connect him with Paine, or Paine with him. This is exactly the &s;ame cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; for after all he &s;aid nothing of Mr. Tooke. What could he have &s;aid, but that he was a &s;ub|&s;criber with the great names, I have read in the&s;e proceed|ings which they have thought fit to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, let others hold their opinions, and change them at their plea&s;ure; I &s;hall ever maintain it to be the deare&s;t privilege of the people of Great Britian to watch over every thing that affects their good government, either in the &s;y&s;tem, or in the practice; and that for this purpo&s;e the pre&s;s mu&s;t be free. It has always been &s;o, and much evil has been corrected by it.&mdash;If government finds it&s;elf annoyed by it, let it examine its own conduct, and it will find the cau&s;e,&mdash;let it amend it, and it will find the remedy.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am no friend to &s;arca&s;ms in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of grave &s;ubjects, but you mu&s;t take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment; Mr. Burke as of|ten as any body indulges in it;&mdash;hear his rea&s;on in his &s;peech on reform, for not taking away the &s;alaries from Lords who attend upon the Briti&s;h Court. "You would," "&s;aid he," have the court de&s;erted by all the nobility of "the kingdom.</P>
<P><Q>Sir, the mo&s;t &s;erious mi&s;chiefs would follow from &s;uch a de&s;ertion. Kings are naturally lovers of low compa|ny; they are &s;o elevated above all the re&s;t of mankind, that they mu&s;t look upon all their &s;ubjects as on a level: they are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occa&s;ional re&s;i&s;tance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It mu&s;t indeed be admitted, that many of the nobility
<PB N="63" REF="025456_0061_0FCD3F366F431B18">
are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, para&s;ites, pimps, and buffoons, as any of the low|e&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind can po&s;&s;ibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, with &s;ome lurking remains of their dignity, will never per|mit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practiti|oner of that tribe. The Roman emperors, almo&s;t from the beginning, threw them&s;elves into &s;uch hands; and the mi&s;chief increa&s;ed every day, till its decline, and its final ruin. It is, therefore, of very great importance (provided the thing is not overdone,) to contrive &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment as mu&s;t, almo&s;t whether a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his per&s;on, a great number of his fir&s;t nobility; and it is rather an u&s;eful prejudice that gives them a pride in &s;uch a &s;ervi|tude though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have, there|fore, not attempted to reform any of the offices of honor about the King's per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>What is this but &s;aying, that a king is an animal &s;o in|curably addicted to low company, as generally to bring on by it the ruin of nations; but neverthele&s;s, he is to be kept as a nece&s;&s;ary evil, and his propen&s;ities bridled by &s;urrounding him with a parcel of mi&s;creants &s;till wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible, but better than tho&s;e he would chu&s;e for him&s;elf. This therefore, if taken by it&s;elf, would be a mo&s;t abomi|nable and libellous &s;arca&s;m on kings and nobility: but look at the whole &s;peech, and you ob&s;erve a great &s;y&s;tem of regulation: and no man, I believe, ever doubted Mr. Burke's attachment to monarchy. To judge, therefore, of any part of a writing, the whole mu&s;t be read.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame view I mean to read to you the beginning of Harrington's Oceana: but it is impo&s;&s;ible to name this well known author without expo&s;ing to ju&s;t contempt and ridicule the ignorant or profligate mi&s;repre&s;entations which are vomited forth upon the public, to bear down every man as de&s;perately wicked, who in any age or country has coun|tenanced a republic, for the mean purpo&s;e of prejudging this trial.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="025456_0062_0FCD3F3898890950">[Mr. Er&s;kine took up a book, but laid it down again without reading from it, &s;aying &s;omething to the gentle|man who &s;at near him, in a low voice, which I did not hear.]</P>
<P>Is this the way to &s;upport the Engli&s;h con&s;titution? Are the&s;e the means by which Engli&s;hmen are to be taught to cheri&s;h it? I &s;ay, if the man upon trial were &s;tained with blood in&s;tead of ink,&mdash;if he were covered over with crimes which human nature would &s;tart at the naming of, the means employed again&s;t him would not be the le&s;s di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>For this notable purpo&s;e then, Harrington, not above a week ago, was handed out to us as a low, ob&s;cure wretch, involved in the murder of the monarch, and the de&s;truc|tion of the monarchy, and as addre&s;&s;ing his de&s;picable works at the &s;hrine of an u&s;urper. Yet this very Har|rington, this low blackguard, was de&s;cended (you may &s;ee his pedigree at the Herald's office for &s;ix pence,) from eight Dukes, three Marqui&s;&s;es, &s;eventy Earls, twenty-&s;even Vi&s;|counts, and thirty-&s;ix Barons, &s;ixteen of whom were Knights of the Garter; a de&s;cent which I think would &s;ave a man from di&s;grace in any of the circles of Germany. But what was he be&s;ides?&mdash;A blood-&s;tained ruffian! Oh brutal igno|rance of the hi&s;tory of the country! He was the mo&s;t af|fectionate &s;ervant of Charles the fir&s;t, from whom he never concealed his opinions; for it is ob&s;erved by Wood, that the King greatly affected his company; but when they hap|pened to talk of a commonwealth, he would &s;carcely en|dure it.&mdash;"I know not," &s;ays Toland, <Q>which mo&s;t to commend; the King for tru&s;ting an hone&s;t man, though a republican; or Harrington for owning his principles while he &s;erved a king.</Q></P>
<P>But did his opinions affect his conduct?&mdash;Let hi&s;tory again an&s;wer.&mdash;He pre&s;erved his fidelity to his unhappy Prince to the very la&s;t, after all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged &s;ubjects. He &s;taid with him while a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight: came up by &s;tealth to follow the fortunes of his Monarch and ma&s;ter; even hid him&s;elf in the boot of the coach when he was conveyed to Wind&s;or; and ending as he began, fell into his arms and fainted on the &s;caffold.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="025456_0063_0FCD3F398D53E938">After Charles's death, the Oceana was written, and, as if it were written from ju&s;tice and affection to his memory: for it breathes the &s;ame noble and &s;pirited regard, and a&s;|&s;erts that it was not Charles that brought on the de&s;truc|tion of the monarchy, but the feeble and ill-con&s;tituted na|ture of monarchy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the book was a flattery to Cromwell.&mdash;Once more and finally, let hi&s;tory decide.</P>
<P>It was &s;eized by the U&s;urper as a libel, and the way it was recovered is remarkable. I mention it to &s;how, that Cromwell was a wi&s;e man in him&s;elf, and knew on what governments mu&s;t &s;tand for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>Harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book, and on entering her apartment, &s;natched up her child and ran away. On her following him with &s;urpri&s;e and terror, he turned to her and &s;aid, <Q>I know what you feel as a mo|ther, feel then for me; your father has got my child:</Q> meaning the Oceana. The Oceana was afterwards re&s;tored on her petition; Cromwell an&s;wering with the &s;agacity of a &s;ound politician, <Q>Let him have his book; if my go|vernment is made to &s;tand, it has nothing to fear from <HI>paper &s;hot.</HI></Q>&mdash;He &s;aid true.&mdash;No good government will ever be battered by paper &s;hot. Monte&s;quieu &s;ays, that, <Q>In a free nation, it matters not whether individuals rea&s;on well or ill; it is &s;ufficient that they do rea&s;on. Truth ari&s;es from the colli&s;ion, and from hence &s;prings liberty, which is a &s;ecurity from the effect of rea&s;oning.</Q> The Attorney General read extracts from Mr. Adams's an&s;wer to this book. Let others do like Mr. Adams: I am not in&s;i&s;ting on the infallibility of Mr. Paine's doc|trines: If they are erroneous, let them be an&s;wered, and truth will &s;pring from the colli&s;ion.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition in a nation to this &s;pecies of controver&s;y, is no proof of &s;edition or degeneracy, but quite the re|ver&s;e, as is mentioned by Milton, (I omitted to cite the pa&s;&s;age with the others,) who in &s;peaking of this &s;ubject, ri&s;es into that inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;ublime &s;tile of writing, wholly peculiar to him&s;elf. He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human: he looked up for light and expre&s;&s;ion, as he him&s;elf wonderfully de&s;cribes it, by devout prayer to that Great Being who is the &s;ource of all utterance and know|ledge;

and who &s;endeth out his &s;eraphim with the hallow|ed fire of his altars to touch and purify the lips of whom he plea&s;es.&mdash;"When the chearfulne&s;s of the people," &s;ays this mighty poet, <Q>is &s;o &s;prightly up, as that it has not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and &s;afety, but to &s;pare, and to be&s;tow upon the &s;olide&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t points of controver&s;y and new invention, it betokens us not degenerated nor drooping to a fatal de|cay, but ca&s;ting off the old and wrinkled &s;kin of corrup|tion to outlive the&s;e pangs, and wax young again, en|tering the glorious ways of truth and pro&s;perous virtue, de&s;tined to become great and honorable in the&s;e latter ages. Methinks I &s;ee, in my mind, a noble and pui&s;|&s;ant nation rou&s;ing her&s;elf, like a &s;trong man, after &s;leep, and &s;haking her invincible locks: methinks I &s;ee her as an eagle muing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and un&s;caling her long-abu&s;ed &s;ight at the fountain it&s;elf of heavenly radiance; while the whole noi&s;e of timorous and flocking birds, with tho&s;e al&s;o that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what &s;he means, and in their envious gabble, would progno&s;ticate a year of &s;ects and &s;chi&s;ms.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, what Milton only &s;aw in his mighty ima|gination, I &s;ee in fact; what he expected, but which never came to pa&s;s, I &s;ee now fulfilling: methinks I &s;ee this no|ble and pui&s;&s;ant nation, not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay, but ca&s;ting off the wrinkled &s;kin of corruption to put on again the vigor of her youth.</P>
<P>And it is, becau&s;e others as well as my&s;elf, &s;ee this that we have all this uproar. France and its con&s;titution are the mere pretences. It is, becau&s;e Britons begin to re|collect the inheritance of their own con&s;titution, left them by their ance&s;tors: It is becau&s;e they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its mo&s;t valuable parts, that for&s;ooth the nation is in danger of being de&s;troyed by a &s;ingle pamphlet.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have marked the cour&s;e of this alarm: It began with the renovation of tho&s;e exertions for the pub|lic, which the authors of the alarm had them&s;elves origi|nated and de&s;erted; and they become louder and louder when they &s;aw the&s;e principles avowed and &s;upported by

my admirable and excellent friend Mr. Fox; the mo&s;t em|inently hone&s;t and enlightened &s;tate&s;man that hi&s;tory brings us acquainted with: a man whom to name is to honor, but whom, in attempting adequately to de&s;cribe, I mu&s;t &s;ly to Mr. Burke, my con&s;tant refuge when eloquence is nece&s;&s;ary: a man, who, to relieve the &s;ufferings of the mo&s;t di&s;tant nation, <Q>put to the hazard his ea&s;e, his &s;ecu|rity; his intere&s;t, his power, even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he had never &s;een.</Q> How much more then for the inhabitants of his native coun|try: yet this is the man who has been cen&s;ured and di&s;a|vowed in the manner we have lately &s;een.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have but a few more words to trouble you with: I take my leave of you with declaring, that all this freedom which I have been endeavoring to a&s;&s;ert, is no more than the freedom which belongs to our own inbred con&s;titution: I have not a&s;ked you to acquit Mr. Paine upon any new lights, or upon any principle but the law, which you are &s;worn to admini&s;ter: My great object has been to inculcate, that wi&s;dom and policy, which are the parents of the law of Great Britain, forbid this jealous eye over her &s;ubjects; and that, on the contrary, they cry aloud in the language of the poet, employed by Lord Chatham on the memorable &s;ubject of America, unfortunately with|out effect:
<Q><L>"Be to their faults a little blind,</L>
<L>"Be to their virtues very kind;</L>
<L>"Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</L>
<L>"And clap your padlock on the mind."</L></Q></P>
<P>Engage them by their affections, convince their rea&s;on, and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty &s;incere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their true&s;t intere&s;t, and that their form of govern|ment is for their common good. Con&s;traint is the natural parent of re&s;i&s;tance, and a pregnant proof, that rea&s;on is not on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who u&s;e it. You mu&s;t all remember, Gentlemen, Lucian's plea&s;ant &s;tory; Jupiter and a coun|tryman were walking together, conver&s;ing with great free|dom and familiarity upon the &s;ubject of heaven and earth. The countryman li&s;tened with attention and acquie&s;cence,
<PB N="68" REF="025456_0066_0FCD3F3F96421308">
while Jupiter &s;trove only to convince him; but happening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned ha&s;tily round and threaten|ed him with his thunder.&mdash;"Ah! ha!" &s;ays the countryman, <Q>now Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you're al|ways wrong when you appeal to your thunder.</Q></P>
<P>This is the ca&s;e with me&mdash;I can rea&s;on with the people of England, but I cannot fight again&s;t the thunder of au|thority.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this is my defence for free opinions. With regard to my&s;elf, I am, and ever have been, obedient and affectionate to <HI>the law:</HI> to that rule of action, as long as I exi&s;t, I &s;hall ever give my voice and my conduct; but I &s;hall ever do as I have done to-day, maintain the dignity of my high profe&s;&s;ion, and perform, as I under&s;tand them, all its important duties.</P>
<P>[Mr. Attorney General aro&s;e immediately to reply to Mr. Er&s;kine, when Mr. Campbell (the foreman of the Jury) &s;aid,&mdash;my Lord, I am authori&s;ed by the Jury here, to inform the Attorney General, that a reply is not nece&s;&s;a|ry for them, unle&s;s the Attorney General wi&s;hes to make it, or your Lord&s;hip.&mdash;Mr. Attorney General &s;at down, and the Jury gave in their verdict,&mdash;<HI>Guilty.</HI>]</P>
