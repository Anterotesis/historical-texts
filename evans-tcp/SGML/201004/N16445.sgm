<P>_IT is my intention, with all po&s;&s;ible plain|ne&s;s, to examine the propo&s;ed plan of a fe|deral government. Its enemies and its ad|vocates have laid particular &s;tre&s;s on the names, wherewith it is &s;ub&s;cribed.

two years; and if they have acted &s;o as to warrant any rea|&s;onable apprehen&s;ion of their de&s;igns, it wil be ea&s;y, at any time, to prevent their election. The truth is, that very few of them either wi&s;h to be elected, or would con&s;ent to &s;erve, either in that hou&s;e, or in the &s;enate. I have exerci&s;ed my imagination to devi&s;e in what manner they, or any other men, &s;uppo&s;ing them to bear full &s;way in both hou&s;es, could erect this imaginary fabric of power.

<P>The convention had the above principle con&s;tantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their view.

<P>To examine their con&s;titution, by arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and &s;ection, would be a painful and needle&s;s undertaking.

When the convention was appointed, I much feared, that the numerous &s;eeds, and principles of di&s;|cord among&s;t the &s;tates, would, for ever, prevent them from agreeing to any efficient &s;y&s;tem whatever. I appre|hended, in particular, that the di&s;pute about repre&s;entation would be the rock, on which the ve&s;&s;el containing all our hopes would be da&s;hed. When, therefore, I di&s;cerned that equita|ble compromi&s;e between the larger and le&s;&s;er &s;tates, my anxiety was in&s;tantly removed, and my &s;oul enlightened by a &s;udden ray.</P>
<P>How then was I, &s;ome months after, di&s;gu&s;ted at the re|petition of the arguments, re&s;pecting the inequality of repre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ives in the fir&s;t branch.

<P>In a&s;certaining and defining the powers of congre&s;s, the convention evidently pur&s;ued this obvious principle, that all
<PB N="13" REF="021131_0011_0FB248E8DEDD1B98">
things, which concern the union in general, &s;hould be re|gulated by the federal head; and that each &s;tate legi&s;lature &s;hould regulate tho&s;e things, which concern only its own internal government, together with the &s;eparate intere&s;ts of its citizens. The enemies of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution have deemed it material to &s;hew, that &s;uch a one never exi&s;ted before. It does not indeed agree with definitions in books, taken from the Amphyctionic council, the United Nether|lands, or the Helvetic body. They would therefore infer, that it is wrong. This mode of rea&s;oning de&s;erves not a &s;erious refutation. The convention examined tho&s;e &s;everal con&s;titutions, if &s;uch they can be called. It found them either woefully defective, as do their own particulars, object, or inapplicable to ours. Peradventure, our own article <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> confederation, in theory, appear more perfect than any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The&s;e articles were made according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rule; the legi&s;lative and executive authorities being ve&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in one a&s;|&s;embly.

<P>It is univer&s;ally, by good writers, agreed, that where any one political body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>full</HI> powers, legi&s;lative and ex|ecutive, whether it be a &s;ingle man, or a &s;elect &s;ay, or a numerous a&s;&s;embly, it matters not;&mdash;the government mu&s;t, in a &s;hort time, become de&s;potic.

of rights. This hackneyed principle has been urged, with great confidence, again&s;t con&s;tituting the &s;enate a council to the pre&s;ident. It has been urged too, even by the men who would have the whole powers of the federal gevernment centered in a &s;ingle a&s;&s;embly. I mean the men who in&s;i&s;t that the convention ought to have done no more than advi&s;e in what manner the powers of the pre&s;ent con|gre&s;s &s;hould be increa&s;ed. Let us under&s;tand the principle in its proper extent. It does not follow, that a body, who&s;e a&s;&s;ent is required in making laws, but who cannot, by them|&s;elves, do any legi&s;lative act, may not be a fit council to the &s;upreme executive magi&s;trate, deriving his authority, like them from the people, in no manner dependent on them, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people, for any pri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> advantage, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;hare in legi&s;lation ex|cept that of offering his advice.</P>
<P>The objection to this part of the con&s;titution, I confe&s;s, at fir&s;t, appeared formidable. The rea&s;ons which I now conjecture to have influenced the convention, did not then occur. But I have long adhered to a maxim, which I warmly recommend to others&mdash;never to condemn, ab&s;olutely, even within my&s;elf, any one kind, until I can hit upon &s;ome other kind which I <HI>conceive</HI> better. As no human in&s;ti|tution can po&s;&s;e&s;s ab&s;olute perfection, it is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> matter to e&s;py &s;ome fault or defect in almo&s;t every thing, which the wit of man can contrive, or, at lea&s;t, to rea&s;on plau&s;ibly again&s;t it. But this faculty of finding faults is by no means &s;ufficient to con&s;titute the politician or &s;tate&s;man.

Exclaims he, who &s;olves all difficulties at once, Why not appoint a body to act as council and nothing el&s;e?</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, and that not very unpopular, is the great additional expence. However, this rea&s;on I deem the light|e&s;t of all; and the general propo&s;ition involves a great varie|ty of other con&s;iderations.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is e&s;&s;ential to a council, that the members be free, as po&s;&s;ible, from all bias, or improper influence. This &s;epa|rate and di&s;tinct council mu&s;t be elected by the people, or
<PB N="15" REF="021131_0013_0FB248EB6B4C9070">
by &s;pecial electors; by the legi&s;lature, or by one of its branches; or by &s;ome other department; or by the pre&s;i|dent.&mdash;</P>
<P>That the people &s;hould either make laws to bind them|&s;elves, or elect per&s;ons, without who&s;e con&s;ent, no laws &s;hall be made, is e&s;&s;ential to their freedom. But univer&s;al experience forbids, that they &s;hould al&s;o immediately choo&s;e per&s;ons for the execution of the laws. Shall the legi&s;lature then, or the &s;enate, or the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, have this appointment? A council thus cho&s;en would be depen|dent on its electors; and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be the &s;ame thing, in many re&s;pects, as if the legi&s;lature &s;hould execute its own laws. Can you believe, that a council, cho&s;en actually, or once in two or three years, would dare to pur&s;ue, in all ca&s;es the dictates of its own judgment, contrary to the known will of tho&s;e, who will &s;oon have an opportunity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> removing them? Would they not be emulous to plea&s;e leading men; and would there not be opened, at every pe|riod of election, a fine field for intrigue and cabal? There would be one way only of rendering a council, thus cho&s;en, independent of their electors; and that is, the choo&s;ing them for life, with &s;alaries, not to be augmented or dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Again&s;t choo&s;ing an executive for life the rea&s;ons are weighty indeed. Should they then hold their commi&s;&s;ions during good behaviour, there mu&s;t be &s;ome tribunal to de|termine on that good behaviour; and what body it can be, except the congre&s;s, would be difficult to decide. Be&s;ides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> behaviour in a member of council is not determinable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of a judge, which has relation to the laws, and things univer&s;ally known. In the office of the former, there is &s;o much le&s;t to di&s;cretion, that I cannot perceive with what propriety he can hold it on the condition of good behaviour. There can be no &s;ure criterion, and the deci|&s;ion mu&s;t therefore unavoidably depend on the di&s;cretion, or mere opinion, of his judges, founded on no e&s;tabli&s;hed principles whatever.&mdash;</P>
<P>A council, cho&s;en by the pre&s;ident him&s;elf would proba|bly con&s;i&s;t of creatures devoted to his will. I can di&s;cern no rea&s;on, wherefore any other officers of the government
<PB N="16" REF="021131_0014_0FB248F326E0C628">
&s;hould make the appointment. There remains then only the people's choo&s;ing electors, and placing the council of the pre&s;ident on the &s;ame footing with him&s;elf. Here occurs the objection of expence; and here again would ari&s;e the controver&s;y re&s;pecting equality of repre&s;entation.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;enate will, in all human likelihood, con&s;i&s;t of the mo&s;t important characters, men of enlightened minds, ma|ture in judgment, independent in their circum&s;tances, and not deriving their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from their pay, as probably would the members of a board, di&s;tinct and &s;epa|rate from all other public employments.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am not, therefore, barely reconciled to the article in que&s;tion&punc; It commands my wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;t admiration, and entire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">u&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>Is there any power improperly tru&s;ted to that &s;elect a&s;&s;em|bly, in which all the &s;tates have equall intere&s;t, and to which they will a&s;&s;uredly make a determined point of &s;ending their be&s;t men? It is this equality, almo&s;t as much as any other circum&s;tance, which recommends it as an executive coun|cil. The &s;enate are to try impeachments. By their advice only, may the pre&s;ident make treaties, appoint amba&s;&s;adors, mini&s;ters, con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and officers, not otherwi&s;e provided for in the con&s;titution. Let us re|flect, whether the&s;e things could be better done, by any other body, and whether it be proper for any one man (&s;up|po&s;e even the &s;aviour of his country to be immortal) to have the appointment of all tho&s;e important officers. It has al|ways appeared to me, that neither one man, nor many men &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s this tran&s;cendent authority, in a republic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ingle man in high power, if he always mean right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an with difficulty di&s;cern the true characters of men.

A &s;elect a&s;&s;embly is not &s;o open to direct application; and although each may be &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain his partialities, he cannot recom|mend his favourites, without pointing out their e&s;&s;ential qualifications, and becoming, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct. It is here, that characters are mo&s;t fairly
<PB N="17" REF="021131_0015_0FB248F6B137F1F0">
inve&s;tigated, and appointments mo&s;t deliberately made. I appeal to univer&s;al experience, whether the&s;e remarks be not &s;trictly founded on fact, and whether the mo&s;t judicious ap|pointments have not been made by &s;mall &s;elect a&s;&s;emblies. I confe&s;s, that, the number of the &s;enators for this purpo&s;e only is exce&s;&s;ive. But I can confidently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly on the extra|ordinary &s;election to compen&s;ate for the exce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE power of the pre&s;ident is alarming peculiarly to that cla&s;s, who cannot bear to view others in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fancied ble&s;&s;ing, to which, alas! they mu&s;t them&s;elves a&s;pire in vain.

Let us examine the foundation of this alarming prediction.&mdash;</P>
<P>Before this appointment can be <HI>entailed,</HI> and before even the term can be enlarged, the con&s;titution mu&s;t be changed, by con&s;ent of the people. By what method, then, &s;hall the pre&s;ident effect this alteration? Every citizen in the union will be a cen&s;or on his conduct. Not even his per&s;on is particularly protected; and the means of oppre&s;&s;ion are lit|tle in his power. Let the jealou&s;y of the people once take the alarm, and, at the expiration of his term, he is di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed as inevitably as light &s;ucceeds to darkne&s;s. The electi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of a pre&s;ident is not carried on in a &s;ingle a&s;&s;embly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nere the &s;everal arts of corruption, may be e&s;&s;ayed. He is elected by per&s;ons cho&s;en by the people; and tho&s;e electors give their &s;uffrages on the &s;ame day, in thir|teen different a&s;&s;emblies, in thirteen different &s;tates. An elective monarchy has long been &s;everely reprobated. But had the countries, where it prevailed, enjoyed regulations like the&s;e, they would perhaps, at this time, be preferred to the rules of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which have &s;o often placed fools and tyrants on the throne.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, however, that the pre&s;ident may po&s;&s;ibly be continued for life. He may &s;o, provided he de&s;erve it. If
<PB N="18" REF="021131_0016_0FB248F8D76891A8">
not, he retires to ob&s;curity, without even the con&s;olation of having produced any of the convul&s;ions, attendant u&s;ually on grand revolutions. Should he be wicked or frantic enough to make the attempt, he attones for it, with the certain lo&s;s of wealth, liberty or life.&mdash;</P>
<P>I return to the powers of congre&s;s. They are almo&s;t univer&s;ally admitted to be proper for a federal head, except only the <HI>&s;weeping clau&s;e,</HI> and the power of rai&s;ing fleets and armies, without any &s;tint or limitation, in time of peace.

<P>It is apprehended, that this <HI>&s;weeping clau&s;e</HI> will afford pre|text, for freeing congre&s;s from all con&s;titutional re&s;traints.</P>
<P>I will not here again in&s;i&s;t on the pledge we enjoy, in the common intere&s;t, and &s;ure attachment of the repre&s;enta|tives and &s;enate; &s;etting a&s;ide the little probability of a ma|jority in each branch lying under the &s;ame temptation. Con&s;ider the import of the words.</P>

<P>For want of &s;ome plain and obvious di&s;tinctions, there has been vented &s;o much &s;en&s;ele&s;s clamour again&s;t &s;tanding armies, that they are become a political bugbear. A limit|ed monarch, with the means of maintaining, at all times, an army devoted to his will, might &s;oon tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mple on the na|tural and civil rights of his &s;ubjects. Could the pre&s;ent congre&s;s find means of augmenting the force, which it now maintains, which of you, on that account, would experience the &s;lighte&s;t anxiety? Which of all the European powers is de&s;titute of an army? Which of them, if they were free, could be &s;ecure of remaining &s;o, without a &s;tanding force? I might go further, and demand, whether any of them have lo&s;t their liberties, by means of a <HI>&s;tanding</HI> army? The troops, continually kept up in Great-Britain, are formidable to its neighbours, and yet no rational Engli&s;hman apprehends the de&s;truction of his rights. It is true, that he knows, the&s;e troops cannot be maintained, without the con&s;ent of his re|pre&s;entatives, annually obtained. But the nece&s;&s;ity of an army he readily conceives; and the number he leaves to the di&s;cretion of parliament. Ought then an American to have greater fears of a pre&s;ident, than an Engli&s;hman has of his king? Or may he not tru&s;t his repre&s;entatives and the &s;enate, with as much confidence, as the Engli&s;hman repo&s;es in the commons and lords?</P>
<P>Let the federal head be con&s;tituted as it may, there can be no perfect &s;ecurity, without both a land force, and na|val armament. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how much will, at all times of peace, be &s;ufficient. We have the &s;ame &s;ecurity again&s;t the abu&s;e of this, as of any other authority. The expences of an army might indeed rai&s;e fears of a different kind,&mdash;that we &s;hall not be able to maintain force enough for the mo&s;t proper occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a limitation in time of peace. What then is to be done on the pro&s;pect of a war? Should you make the

If you make no di&s;tinction, then will it be expedient to de|clare war, at the in&s;tant in which the danger &s;hall be con|ceived, in order that it may be lawful to prepare for only a ju&s;t defence. In fine, I con&s;ider this grand objection, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ere pretext for terrifying you, like children, with &s;pectres <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd hobgobblins. It may be material here to remark, that although a well regulated militia has ever been con&s;idered as the true defence of a free republic, there are always hone&s;t purpo&s;es, which are not to be an&s;wered by a militia. If they were, the burthen on the militia would be &s;o great, that a free people would, by no means, be willing to &s;u&s;tain it. If indeed it be po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, that congre&s;s &s;hall, at any future period, alarm us by an improper augmen|tation of troops, could we not, in that ca&s;e, depend on the militia, which is our&s;elves. In &s;uch a ca&s;e it would be ridi|culous to urge, that the federal government is inve&s;ted with a power over the whole militia of the union. Even when congre&s;s &s;hall exerci&s;e this power, on the mo&s;t proper occa|&s;ions, it is provided in the con&s;titution, that each &s;tate &s;hall officer, and train its own militia.&mdash;</P>
<P>The objections again&s;t the judiciary are probably more &s;incere. The article has been generally mi&s;conceived, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ented; and after be&s;towing much attention, I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ertain, that I fully comprehend it. I am, however, at length &s;atisfied, that no rational con&s;truction can be given to this part of the propo&s;ed plan, either to warrant a rejection of the whole, or to place matters on a wor&s;e footing, than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The judiciary power is to be ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, fixed at the &s;eat of government; and, for the advantage of government, with the ea&s;e and convenience of the people, the congre&s;s may hereafter appoint inferior courts in each of the &s;tates. The juri&s;diction of this &s;upreme court is to be partly original, and partly appellate. With re&s;pect to the extent of either, there can be no po&s;&s;ible doubt, as there is neither ambiguity nor uncertainty in the relative ex|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>One doubt ari&s;ing on the judiciary article is, whether in the&s;e ca&s;es of appellate juri&s;diction, the appeal has both from the &s;tate courts, and the inferior federal courts, or only from the former, or only from the latter.</P>
<P>Another doubt is, whether the inferior federal courts are to be branches of the &s;upreme court, con&s;tituted for conve|nience, and having equal juri&s;diction, both original and ap|pellate, with the &s;upreme court; or whether the inferior courts are to be confined to an <HI>original</HI> juri&s;diction in tho&s;e ca&s;es, wherein the &s;upreme court has <HI>appellate</HI> juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to decide ab&s;olutely on the genuine con&s;truction of an article, which is &s;aid to have cau&s;ed much private debate and perplexity. I am however fully per|&s;uaded, that, as the article &s;peaks of an original and ap|pellate juri&s;diction, of a &s;upreme court, and inferior courts; and, as there is no intimation of appeals from the &s;everal
<PB N="22" REF="021131_0020_0FB24905B5FCFBE0">
&s;tate tribunals, the inferior federal courts are intended to have original juri&s;diction in all ca&s;es, wherein the &s;upreme court has appellate juri&s;diction; and the appeal lies only from them. I can, almo&s;t, with confidence, maintain, that, as there is no expre&s;s clau&s;e, or nece&s;&s;ary implication, to ou&s;t the juri&s;diction of &s;tate courts, an action, after the a|doption of the plan, may be in&s;tituted in any court, having, at this time, a juri&s;diction. And if an action be brought in a &s;tate court, I do not, at pre&s;ent, perceive, that it can, in any manner, be transferred to the &s;upreme or inferior federal court.</P>
<P>According then to the be&s;t of my judgment the affair &s;tands thus. The &s;upreme federal court will have an exclu|&s;ive original juri&s;diction in all ca&s;es relative to the rights of amba&s;&s;adors, other mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls; becau&s;e, as I humbly conceive, the &s;everal &s;tate governments have at this time nothing to do with the&s;e ca&s;es. With re&s;pect to the ca&s;es, in which a &s;tate may be party, the &s;upreme federal court, and the &s;everal &s;tate courts, will have, I conceive, concurrent original juri&s;diction, <HI>provided a &s;tate may, at this time, in&s;titute an action in its own name, in the courts of another &s;tate.</HI> The inferior federal courts, and the &s;tate courts, will, I conceive, have concurrent original juri&s;dic|tion in all the enumerated ca&s;es, wherein all appeal lies to the &s;upreme court, <HI>except only the ca&s;es created by or under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, in which, as they do not now exi&s;t, the inferior federal courts will have exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction.</HI> From the &s;tate inferior courts, I further apprehend, that an appeal will lie, in all ca&s;es, to their own high courts of ap|peal, as heretofore.</P>
<P>A choice of juri&s;dictions has been ever e&s;teemed a valuable right, even where there are both of the &s;ame kind. The purpo&s;e of extending &s;o far the juri&s;diction of the federal ju|diciary, is to give every a&s;&s;urance to the general govern|ment, of a faithful execution of its laws, and to give citi|zens, &s;tates, and foreigners, an a&s;&s;urance of the impartial ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Without this &s;alutary in&s;titution, the federal government might frequently be ob&s;tructed, and its &s;ervants want protection. It is calculated not as an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, but to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and good

order. The provi&s;ions re&s;pecting different &s;tates, their citi|zens, and foreigners, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, are much to be applauded. The human mind is &s;o framed, that the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance may prevent the mo&s;t upright and well known tribunal from giving complete &s;atisfaction; and there may happen a variety of ca&s;es, where the di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion may not be altogether de&s;titute of a ju&s;t founda|tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles, an appeal as to fact is no le&s;s proper, than the appeal from judges of law. A jury, who&s;e legal qualifications are only property and ripe age, may more pro|bably incur the imputation of weakne&s;s, partiality, or undue influence. But in regard to appeals, it is very material to remark, that congre&s;s is to make &s;uch regulations and ex|ceptions, as upon mature deliberation, it &s;hall think proper. And indeed, before &s;uch regulations and exceptions &s;hall be made, the manner of appeal will not be a&s;certained. Is it then to be pre&s;umed, that, in making regulations and ex|ceptions, this appellate juri&s;diction &s;hall be calculated as an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, or to &s;erve only the purpo&s;es of vexa|tion and delay.&mdash;</P>
<P>As the rod of Aaron once &s;wallowed up the rods of the Egyptian <HI>magi,</HI> &s;o al&s;o is it feared, that the&s;e federal courts will, at length, &s;wallow up the &s;tate tribunals. A miracle, in one ca&s;e, is as nece&s;&s;ary, as in the other.</P>

<P>As the articles of confederation contain no provi&s;ion, for adju&s;ting the di&s;pute between the United, and particular, &s;tates, Maryland, for a long time, refu&s;ed her ratification. An adequate provi&s;ion is made by the propo&s;ed plan. That the United States will a&s;&s;uredly in&s;titute actions again&s;t two of the &s;tates, &s;etting up claims equally wild and exten&s;ive, may appear from the following &s;tatement.</P>
<P>New-Hamp&s;hire, Rhode-I&s;land, New-Jer&s;ey, Delaware and Maryland, have been always intere&s;ted in making good the common claim; as they never laid any particular claim to the territory in que&s;tion.&mdash;</P>

<P>Connecticut, and New-York, have both made ce&s;&s;ions, which congre&s;s has accepted. The&s;e two are therefore become in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania, although very exten&s;ive, has her limits a&s;cer|tained. She likewi&s;e is intere&s;ted.&mdash;</P>
<P>Virginia, having made a ce&s;&s;ion to congre&s;s, has &s;ince re|linqui&s;hed a part of the re&s;erved lands, or at lea&s;t offered inde|pendence, to Kentucky.&mdash;</P>
<P>North-Carolina, having once made a ce&s;&s;ion, thought proper, in the omnipotence of her di&s;tinct &s;overeignty, to repeal the act. Will not the ce&s;&s;ion be determined valid, and the repeal void?</P>
<P>South-Carolina al&s;o, <HI>it is &s;aid,</HI> has ceded part of that terri|tory, which lately &s;he di&s;puted with Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">. In this ca&s;e the United States have their claim fortified.&mdash;</P>
<P>But Georgia, the weake&s;t of all, lays claim to an immen&s;e tract of country. In this territory there are warlike and in|dependent tribes of the <HI>aborigines,</HI> now carrying terror and de&s;olation towards the heart of the country occupied by the whites. It is expected, that this circum&s;tance, with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the weak foundation of her claims, will di&s;po&s;e Georgia to give up without a &s;uit, and con&s;ent to be circum|&s;cribed within narrower limits, &s;o &s;oon as a proper tribunal &s;hall have power to enter upon a rational inve&s;tigation.&mdash;</P>
<P>N. B.

In the cour&s;e of ten years, not one action, that I know of, in Maryland, has concerned either another &s;tate, or an am|ba&s;&s;ador, con&s;ul, or other mini&s;ter.

<P><PB N="25" REF="021131_0023_0FB2490D2EE87028">A gentleman, as it is conjectured, in the law department of a neighbouring &s;tate, has been plea&s;ed to infer, that ficti|ons, &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the king's bench and exchequer of England, will be contrived, to draw cau&s;es into the federal courts. He &s;eems not aware, that, even in England, the e&s;tabli&s;hed fictions of law are not of modern date. They were ingenious devices, to remedy defects in the common law, <HI>without the aid of parliament.</HI> The fundamental prin|ciple however, with re&s;pect to their adoption, was, that they <HI>con&s;i&s;t with equity, and be requi&s;ite for the advancement of ju&s;tice.</HI> Now every man, who would e&s;tabli&s;h over his cau&s;e a juri&s;diction in a federal court, mu&s;t &s;hew, that &s;uch cau&s;e comes under the de&s;cription of the con&s;titution. If he do not, there will be wanting that equity, which is the &s;upport of legal fiction. But can any man &s;eriou&s;ly imagine, that fiction will be permitted, to give the judges a power of legi&s;lation, denied to congre&s;s it&s;elf? Wherefore &s;hould the judges, holding their commi&s;&s;ions during good behaviour, be guilty of &s;uch gro&s;s fal&s;hood, perjury, and breach of tru&s;t? Would there not be a general revolt again&s;t &s;uch barefaced impudent innovations? Away then with your trumpery of fictions! Accu&s;e not the illu&s;trious members of the conven|tion of having in their contemplation &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try, petti|fogging and chicane! But another fear is, that whatever actions may be in&s;tituted in the federal courts will there &s;eek an admi&s;&s;ion, on account of a more &s;peedy deci&s;ion. That man alone, "on who&s;e brow &s;hame is a&s;hamed to &s;it," will avow his oppo&s;ition to a more &s;peedy admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of the trial by jury has been &s;anctified by the experience of ages. It has been recogni&s;ed by the con|&s;titution of every &s;tate in the union. It is deemed the birth|right of Americans; and it is imagined, that liberty cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. The propo&s;ed plan expre&s;sly adopts it, for the deci&s;ion of all criminal accu&s;ations, except impeach|ment; and is &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the determination of facts in civil cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The inference, hence drawn by many, is not warranted by the premi&s;es. By recogni&s;ing the jury trial in criminal ca&s;es, the con&s;titution effectually provides, that it &s;hall pre|vail,

&s;o long as the con&s;titution it&s;elf &s;hall remain unimpair|ed and unchanged. But, from the great variety of civil ca&s;es, ari&s;ing under this plan of government, it would be unwi&s;e and impolitic to &s;ay ought about it, in regard to the&s;e. Is there not a great variety of ca&s;es, in which this trial is taken away in each of the &s;tates? Are there not ma|ny more ca&s;es, where it is denied in England? For the con|vention to a&s;certain in what ca&s;es it &s;hall prevail, and in what others it may be expedient to prefer other modes, was impracticable. On this &s;ubject, a future congre&s;s is to de|cide; and I &s;ee no foundation under Heaven for the opinion, that congre&s;s will de&s;pi&s;e the known prejudices and inclina|tion of their countrymen. A very ingenious writer of Phi|ladelphia has mentioned the objections without deigning to refute that, which he conceives to have originated "in &s;heer malice."&mdash;</P>
<P>I proceed to attack the whole body of anti-federali&s;ts in their &s;trong hold. The propo&s;ed con&s;titution contains no <HI>bill of rights.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider again the nature and intent of a federal republic. It con&s;i&s;ts of an a&s;&s;emblage of di&s;tinct &s;tates, each complete|ly organized for the protection of its own citizens, and the whole con&s;olidated, by expre&s;s compact, under one head, for their general welfare and common defence.</P>
<P>Should the compact authori&s;e the &s;overeign, or head, to do all things it may think nece&s;&s;ary and proper, then is there no limitation to its authority; and the liberty of each citizen in the union has no other &s;ecurity, than the &s;ound policy, good faith, virtue, and perhaps proper intere&s;ts, of the head.</P>
<P>When the compact confers the afore&s;aid general power, making neverthele&s;s &s;ome &s;pecial re&s;ervations and exceptions, then is the citizen protected further, &s;o far as the&s;e re&s;erva|tions and exceptions &s;hall extend.</P>
<P>But, when the compact a&s;certains and defines the power delegated to the federal head, then cannot this government, without manife&s;t u&s;urpation, exert any power not expre&s;sly, or by <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> implication, conferred by the compact.</P>
<P>This doctrine is &s;o obvious and plain, that I am amazed any good man &s;hould deplore the omi&s;&s;ion of a bill of rights.
<PB N="27" REF="021131_0025_0FB2491192481590">
When we were told, that the celebrated Mr. Wil&s;on had advanced this doctrine in effect, it was &s;aid, Mr. Wil&s;on would not dare to &s;peak thus to a CONSTITUTIONA|LIST.

<P>It is, however, the idea of another mo&s;t re&s;pectable cha|racter, that, as a bill of rights could do no harm, and might quiet the minds of many good people, the convention would have done well to indulge them.&mdash;With all due de|ference, I apprehend, that a bill of rights might not be this innocent quieting in&s;trument. Had the convention entered on the work, they mu&s;t have comprehended within it every thing, which the citizens of the United States claim as a natural or a civil right. An omi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle article would have cau&s;ed more di&s;content, than is either felt, or pretended, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. A multitude of articles might be the &s;ource of infinite controver&s;y, by cla&s;hing with the powers intended to be given. To be full and certain, a bill of rights might have co&s;t the convention more time, than was expended on their other work. The very appear|ance of it might rai&s;e more clamour than its omi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;I mean from tho&s;e, who &s;tudy pretexts for condemning the whole fabric of the con&s;titution.&mdash;<Q>What!

If indeed they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that tyrannic &s;way, which the kings of England had once u&s;urped, we might humbly thank them for their <HI>magna charta,</HI> defective as it is. As that is not the ca&s;e, we will not &s;uffer it to be under&s;tood, that their <HI>new-fangled</HI> federal head &s;hall domineer with the powers not excepted by their precious bill of rights. What! If the owner of 1000 acres of land thinks proper to &s;ell one half, is it nece&s;&s;ary for him to take a relea&s;e from the vendee of the other half? Ju&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the people to have a grant of their natural rights from a government, which derives every thing it has, from the grant of the people.&mdash;</Q></P>

It declares, that gold and &s;ilver only &s;hall be a tender for &s;pecie debts; and that no law &s;hall impair the obligation of a contract.</P>
<P>I have here perhaps touched a &s;tring, which &s;ecretly draws together many of the foes to the plan. Too long have we &s;u&s;tained evils, re&s;ulting from injudicious emi&s;&s;ions of paper, and from the operation of tender laws. To bills of credit, as they are now fal&s;ely called, may we impute the entire lo&s;s of confidence between men.

Hence chiefly are the bankruptcies throughout America, and the di&s;reputable ruinous &s;tate of our com|merce. Hence is it principally, that America hath lo&s;t its credit abroad, and American faith become a proverb. The convention plainly &s;aw, that nothing &s;hort of a renunciation of the right to emit bills of credit could produce that grand con&s;ummation of policy, the RESTORATION of PUB|LIC and PRIVATE FAITH.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible for the nations abroad to &s;uppo&s;e Great-Britain would emit bills on the terms whereon they have i&s;&s;ued in America, how &s;oon would the wide arch of that mighty em|pire tumble into ruins? In no other country in the univer&s;e has prevailed the idea of &s;upplying, by <HI>promi&s;&s;ory notes,</HI> the want of coin, for commerce and taxes.

When that un|happy &s;tate was devoted to the mi&s;eries of a civil war, did congre&s;s even dare to interpo&s;e? Con&s;cious of its inability to protect, it could only await the re&s;ult, in &s;ilence and in ter|ror.

But, notwith&s;tanding the univer&s;al contagion of the alarm, did the &s;tates, on <HI>that</HI> oc|ca&s;ion, comply with the <HI>requi&s;ition?</HI> Suppo&s;e even an inva|&s;ion by a foreign power,&mdash;in what manner could congre&s;s provide for its own defence? In the contemptible light, in which America has lately &s;tood, is it rea&s;onable to expect &s;he will be &s;uffered to remain long in peace? The di&s;tance between the two continents is the only circum&s;tance, on which we can rely. All Europe is now in &s;u&s;pence; and the re&s;ult of your deliberations will in&s;truct her in the part &s;he &s;hall act.</P>
<P>With amazement, her nations contemplate a &s;cene; of which the world is too young to furni&s;h a parallel. We a&s;|&s;embled our &s;ages, patriots, and &s;tate&s;men, to con&s;ult what mode of government is capable of producing the greate&s;t &s;um
<PB N="30" REF="021131_0028_0FB2491B750E4A68">
of general good, with the lea&s;t mixture of general, and par|tial evil. Not that each individual in this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly was expected to offer a &s;y&s;tem; but that the product of their joint wi&s;dom &s;hould be referred to the &s;everal &s;tates, to be adopted, or rejected, as the great body of the people &s;hall determine on a free and full deliberation.</P>
<P>As the occa&s;ion was unparalleled, &s;o al&s;o is the plan, which, after many months of painful inve&s;tigation, is &s;ubmitted, with an unanimity, al&s;o unparalleled.</P>
<P>If there be any man, who approves the great outlines of the plan, and, at the &s;ame time, would reject it, becau&s;e he views &s;ome of the minute parts as imperfect, he &s;hould re|flect, that, if the &s;tates &s;hall think as he does, an alteration may be hereafter effected, at lei&s;ure. When the convention determined, that the whole &s;hould be received, or the whole fail, they did it not on an arrogant conceit of their own in|fallibity, but on the &s;ounde&s;t principles of policy and com|mon &s;en&s;e. Were each &s;tate legi&s;lature, or convention, to take it up, article by article, and &s;ection by &s;ection, with the liberty of adopting &s;ome, and rejecting the re&s;t, in all proba|bility, &s;o &s;mall a part would be approved by nine &s;tates, on the narrow view which each has of the &s;ubject, and attached as each is to its own &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t, that, in its mutilated condition, it would be wor&s;e than the pre&s;ent confederation. For thirteen different a&s;&s;emblies, in that way, to approve &s;o much of any plan whatever, as might merit the name of &s;y&s;|tem, the convention well knew to be impo&s;&s;ible. Were there any one body of men, inve&s;ted with full power, in behalf of the whole United States, to con&s;ider, and amend the plan, then would it be proper to debate it by &s;ections, in the &s;ame manner as it was originally debated.</P>
<P>With a view to defeat totally the plan, another general convention is propo&s;ed; not with the power of giving a fini&s;hing hand to a con&s;titution; but <HI>again</HI> to con&s;ider ob|jections, to &s;trike out, to add, and <HI>again</HI> to make their re|port to the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P>In this way, there can never be an end. We mu&s;t at la&s;t return to this,&mdash;that whatever is agreed on, by the a&s;&s;embly appointed to propo&s;e, mu&s;t be either adopted in the whole, or in the whole rejected.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="021131_0029_0FB2491CEC1199D8">The idea of a new convention is &s;tarted by &s;ome men, with the vain expectation of having amendments made to &s;uit a particular &s;tate, or to advance their own &s;elfi&s;h views. Were this fatal idea adopted, I &s;hould bid a la&s;t adieu to that elevated hope, which now in&s;pires me, of living under the happie&s;t form of government which the &s;un ever beheld. Recollect again and again, that almo&s;t every &s;tate in the union made a determined point of delegating its fir&s;t charac|ters to this grand convention. Reflect upon the time &s;pent in the arduous work, and the &s;acrifices which tho&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed per&s;ons made to their country. Should the &s;ame men be deputed again, would they not, think you, with the &s;ame unanimity, &s;ub&s;cribe and recommend the &s;ame plan? So far as I have been informed, tho&s;e members, who, in the progre&s;&s;ion of the plan, had oppo&s;ed certain parts, and yet afterwards &s;ub&s;cribed cheerfully to the whole, have, with the candour which becomes them, acknowledged their errors in debate. Even an illu&s;trious character, who was of the mi|nority, con&s;i&s;ting only of three, I have been told, has &s;ince regretted his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then a &s;econd convention, with a different choice of delegates. The&s;e too would either &s;peedily &s;ub&s;cribe, or they might propo&s;e &s;ome other &s;y&s;tem, to be debated, para|graph by paragraph, in thirteen different a&s;&s;emblies; and then there would be the &s;ame probability of a mutilated plan; or they would propo&s;e &s;omething, to be adopted or rejected in the whole; and there would be the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of ano|ther convention. Be&s;ides, as the &s;econd convention, if it con|&s;i&s;t of different men, mu&s;t <HI>inevitably</HI> be inferior to the fir&s;t, there is little probability that their work will be &s;uperior. Never again, in an a&s;&s;embly con&s;tituted as that was, will there be found the &s;ame liberality of &s;entiment, "the &s;ame &s;pirit of amity, and the &s;ame mutual deference and conce&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>If it be contended, that the &s;econd, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the various objections from the &s;everal &s;tates, mu&s;t be better able to determine, I would a&s;k, what conduct this &s;econd con|vention &s;hould adopt? Are they to take the propo&s;ed plan, and &s;trike out every thing objected to by nine &s;tates, or by &s;even &s;tates, or by any one of the &s;tates? Or may they like wi&s;e adopt and recommend the entire plan? In &s;hort, to
<PB N="32" REF="021131_0030_0FB2491F80090880" MS="y">
appoint a &s;econd convention, merely to con&s;ult and propo&s;e, would be the mo&s;t ab&s;urd expedient, that ever, in a matter of this amazing magnitude, was propo&s;ed. Does any man then entertain the thought of another kind of convention, in|ve&s;ted with full powers to con&s;ult, amend, adopt, and con|firm? A &s;cheme like this was never yet, I tru&s;t, in agitation. But, if it were, I would propo&s;e this &s;ingle que&s;tion. Whe|ther is it better to amend, before it be tried, that plan, which may be termed the re&s;ult of the wi&s;dom of America, or leave it to be amended, at lei&s;ure, as mature experience &s;hall direct?</P>
<P>Although a very great variety of &s;en&s;ible objections have been publicly offered, the real and &s;incere objections are hardly ever di&s;clo&s;ed in private. There is a cla&s;s, op|po&s;ed to the union of <HI>thirteen different &s;tates,</HI> and the rea&s;on they a&s;&s;ign, is the va&s;t extent of our territory. Let us con|&s;ider well their objection.</P>
<P>To con&s;olidate the whole thirteen &s;tates into a &s;ingle or|ganization, was out of the convention's contemplation,&mdash;for two unan&s;werable rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place, they were &s;a|tisfied, that not one of the &s;tates would renounce its &s;o|vereignty. In the next place, they con&s;idered, that, in a &s;ingle government, with a great extent of territory, the ad|vantages are mo&s;t unequally diffu&s;ed. As the extreme parts are &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of its protection, &s;o are they &s;carcely un|der its domination. It is generally agreed, that a great ex|tended nation can long continue under no <HI>&s;ingle</HI> form of go|vernment, except a de&s;poti&s;m, into which, either a republic, or a limited monarchy, will be certain to degenerate. And hence, if I under&s;tand the man who &s;tyles him&s;elf a <HI>Cen|tinel,</HI> he in&s;inuates, that, if the&s;e &s;tates will per&s;i&s;t in re|maining under one head, they mu&s;t &s;oon fall under the do|minion of a de&s;pot. But, my fellow-citizens, in a confe|derate republic, con&s;i&s;ting of di&s;tinct &s;tates, completely or|ganized within them&s;elves, and each of no greater extent than is proper for a republican form, almo&s;t all the ble&s;&s;ings of government are equally diffu&s;ed. Its protection extends to the remote&s;t corner, and there every man is under re|&s;traint of laws.</P>

<P>The idea of a balance has long influenced the politics of Europe. But how much &s;uperior to this almo&s;t impractica|ble balance would be a general league, con&s;tituting a kind of federal republic, con&s;i&s;ting of all the independent powers in Europe, for preventing the impo&s;itions and encroachments of one upon another! A true and perfect confederate go|vernment, however, in her &s;ituation, is not to be attained; although the great &s;oul of HENRY THE FOURTH is &s;aid to have conceived the idea.</P>

Or &s;hall &s;he divide into two or more federal republics, actuated by the &s;ame malignant di&s;po&s;itions? In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, after &s;truggling through infinite toils, difficulty, and danger, &s;hould the thirteen &s;ingle &s;tates be, at la&s;t, delivered from foreign foes, they will fall upon each other; and no man can predict, what forms of government, or divi&s;ion of terri|tory, &s;hall finally obtain&mdash;. Two or three federal repub|lics might po&s;&s;ibly retain their independence. But they would be in the &s;ame &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to each other, as France, England, and Spain, &s;carcely ever free from war; practi&s;ing the arts of di&s;&s;imulation and intrigue; in vain &s;triving to impo&s;e, by endle&s;s negotiation; and, after all, relying only on the immen&s;e naval and land forces, which they continually maintain.</P>

<P>With the pro&s;pect of my country's future glory, pre&s;ented to my glowing imagination, it is difficult to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong impul&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m.

To acquit them&s;elves, like men, when vi&s;ible danger a&s;&s;ails; and, when it is repelled, to &s;ink like &s;avages, into indolence, is &s;aid to be the characteri&s;tic of Americans. I am not, however, one of tho&s;e, who imagine a nece&s;&s;ity for embracing almo&s;t any &s;cheme, which the con|vention might have devi&s;ed, for giving to the union more efficient powers. Had the plan, they have propo&s;ed, con|tained the &s;eeds of much, though di&s;tant, evil, perhaps a <HI>faithful patriot</HI> might addre&s;s you thus:</P>
<P><Q>Let us not, my friends, in a fit of unmanly apprehen|&s;ion, betray that immen&s;e charge, with which Americans, at this day, are entru&s;ted!

<P>To this purpo&s;e might a man plau&s;ibly declaim; provided the propo&s;ed plan contained many and great faults; provided it were not calculated to promote the general good, without violating the <HI>ju&s;t rights</HI> of a &s;ingle individual; and provided it were not the be&s;t, which, under all circum&s;tances, could be rea&s;onably expected. It was the parting declaration of
<PB N="35" REF="021131_0033_0FB249276B2E88F0">
the American NESTOR, to his exalted fellow-labourers, that <Q>he would &s;ub&s;cribe, becau&s;e he thought it good, and be|cau&s;e he did not know, but it was the be&s;t that could be contrived.</Q> My own declaration, which would be the &s;ame, were I now &s;tanding on the verge of eternity, is, that if the whole matter were left to my di&s;cretion, I would not change a &s;ingle part. On reflection, I was plea&s;ed with the conduct of the Virginia and Maryland a&s;&s;emblies, in ap|pointing di&s;tant days for the meeting of their &s;tate conven|tions. Not that I greatly admired the &s;uppo&s;ed motive; but becau&s;e I &s;incerely wi&s;hed every man might have time to comprehend and weigh the plan, before the ultimate deci&s;ion of the&s;e two &s;tates &s;hould be pronounced. The longer it is contemplated, after it is under&s;tood, the greater, I am per|&s;uaded, will be the approbation of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h the pub|lic good, and to who&s;e private views and expectations, no|thing, which tends to promote that good, can be greatly de|trimental.&mdash;</P>
<P>But alas! My fellow-citizens, on the adoption of this fatal plan, and when every part of the great complicated ma|chine &s;hall be put in motion, the lu&s;tre of our &s;tate a&s;&s;emblies will be dimini&s;hed by the &s;uperior &s;plendour of the federal head. This &s;ingle con&s;ideration, although many he&s;itate to avow it, will cau&s;e more oppo&s;ition, than all the re&s;t united. Weigh well the objection. If ever it be material to inquire, by whom rea&s;ons are adduced, it is on this peculiar occa|&s;ion. From the objection it&s;elf, may perhaps be di&s;|cerned the danger we are expo&s;ed to, from the &s;ecret views and &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations of the objector.</P>

The principle, on which, at length, he &s;urrenders, is the nece&s;&s;ity of every one's making a ce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome rights, to enable the &s;overeign to protect the re&s;t. Each &s;tate is fully &s;en&s;ible, that &s;he cannot protect her&s;elf; and yet &s;he would enjoy the advantages of an union, without making the nece&s;&s;ary contributions.

Con&s;ider then the particular inte|re&s;ts of each; and bear this in your minds, that an intere&s;t may be either honourable and prai&s;e worthy, or directly the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>You have been told, that the propo&s;ed plan was calculated peculiarly for the rich. In all governments, not merely de&s;potic, the wealthy mu&s;t, in mo&s;t things, find an advan|tage, from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, which is too much the end and aim of all mankind. In the propo&s;ed plan, there is no|thing like a di&s;crimination in their favour. How this a|mazing objection is to be &s;upported, I am at a lo&s;s to con|jecture. Is it a ju&s;t cau&s;e of reproach, that the con&s;titution effectually &s;ecures property? Or would the objectors intro|duce a general &s;cramble? In eligibility to office, in &s;uffrage, and in every other civil right, all men are on terms of perfect equality. And yet, notwith&s;tanding this ju&s;t equality, each man is to pay taxes in proportion to his ability, or his ex|pences.&mdash;</P>
<P>A &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing objection remains to be con&s;idered. <Q>This new con&s;titution, &s;o much be prai&s;ed and admired, will commence in a moderate ari&s;tocracy. To a corrupt and oppre&s;&s;ive one the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y, and inevitable, unle&s;s &s;ome Cae&s;ar, or a Cromwell, in their &s;tead, &s;hall make a &s;eizure of your liberties. As to the hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives, they will either be in&s;ignificant &s;pectators of the conte&s;t between the pre&s;ident and the &s;enate, or their weight will be thrown into one of the &s;cales.</Q></P>
<P>No man, indeed, has exactly u&s;ed the&s;e words; but they contain the &s;um and &s;cope of &s;everal recent publications.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my remarks, I have already &s;aid enough to expo&s;e the futility of certain objections, which are u&s;hered to the world, under the au&s;pices of a pair of honourable names. Notwith&s;tanding the care and pompo&s;ity, with which they are circulated, it is not worth while to draw an invidious compari&s;on. One gentleman, who&s;e name is thus <HI>freely</HI> u&s;ed, I think, calls the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives a mere
<PB N="40" REF="021131_0038_0FB2493669D27778">
&s;hred, or rag of repre&s;entation. Does he con&s;ider the di&s;|tinction between the objects of a confederate republic, and of a &s;ingle government? It is a poor return for that &s;ingular re&s;pect, which the convention paid to the maje&s;ty of the peo|ple, in contriving, that congre&s;s &s;hall not only be a repre|&s;entation of &s;tates, as heretofore, but al&s;o an immediate re|pre&s;entation of the people. Were 5, 10, or even 20,000, the ratio propo&s;ed, then peradventure the honourable objector might clamour about the expence of a mobbi&s;h legi&s;lature. The fact is, that the new government, con&s;tructed on the broad ba&s;is of equality, mutual benefits, and national good, is not calculated to &s;ecure a &s;ingle &s;tate all her natural advan|tages, at the expence of the natural and acquired advantages of her re&s;pectable brethren of New-England.&mdash;</P>
<P>His real objection again&s;t con&s;tituting the &s;enate an exe|cutive council ari&s;es, I conceive, from the equality of repre|&s;entation. As to the trite maxim, that the legi&s;lative and executive ought ever to be di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, I would, in addition to my foregoing ob&s;ervations on this head, refer him to Monte&s;quieu's chapter on the Engli&s;h government. I could wi&s;h, the writings of that great man, and of judge Black&s;tone, &s;o often either copied, or cited for conclu&s;ive authority, were better under&s;tood. Should a &s;econd, or a third convention, be obtained, the afore&s;aid honourable gen|tlemen can never be <HI>fully</HI> indulged in their main object of a proportionate repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The examples of a genuine ari&s;tocracy are rare. They were founded in times of profound ignorance, and when the ma&s;s of property was in the hands of a few, whil&s;t the re&s;t pined in want and wretchedne&s;s. One European ari&s;tocra|tic government, if &s;uch it can be called, has grown out of an original defective form, the offspring of nece&s;&s;ity, and commenced amid&s;t the horrors of a civil war. Although the people of that country fought, and intended, to be free, their compact of government never was complete; they did not attend to the principle of rotation, and checks; and a genuine repre&s;entation did never there prevail.&mdash;</P>
<P>An ari&s;tocracy can perhaps &s;ub&s;i&s;t only with a moderate extent of territory and population.&mdash;But it is a farce to talk of an ari&s;tocracy; when there are two branches, &s;o dif|ferently
<PB N="41" REF="021131_0039_0FB24939CBE2B1B0">
formed; when the members of each are cho&s;en for a rea&s;onable term; and when their re-appointment depends on the good opinion of their countrymen. It is not in na|ture, that a man with the lea&s;t portion of <HI>common</HI> &s;en&s;e can believe, the people of America will con&s;ent to &s;uch a de|plorable change in their con&s;titution, as &s;hall confine all power to a few noble families, or that, without their con|&s;ent, the change will be effected, by internal policy, or force.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t mankind &s;hall believe freedom to be better than &s;lavery; whil&s;t our lands &s;hall be generally di&s;tributed, and not held by a few in&s;olent barons, on the deba&s;ing terms of va&s;|&s;allage; whil&s;t we &s;hall teach our children to read and write; whil&s;t the liberty of the pre&s;s, that grand palladium, which tyrants are compelled to re&s;pect, &s;hall remain; whil&s;t a &s;park of public love &s;hall animate even a &s;mall part of the people; whil&s;t even &s;elf-love &s;hall be the general ruling principle; &s;o long will it be impo&s;&s;ible for an ari&s;tocracy to ari&s;e from the propo&s;ed plan.&mdash;Should Heaven, in its wrath, inflict blindne&s;s on the people of America; &s;hould they reject this fair offer of permanent &s;afety and happine&s;s;&mdash;to predict, what &s;pecies of government &s;hall at la&s;t &s;pring from di&s;order, is beyond the &s;hort reach of political fore&s;ight.</P>
<P>Believe me, my fellow-citizens, that no overweening &s;elf-conceit, no vain ambition, no re&s;tle&s;s meddling &s;pirit, has produced this addre&s;s. Long had I waited to &s;ee this va&s;t que&s;tion treated, as it de&s;erves; and the publication di&s;&s;eminated in my native &s;tate. Many judicious ob&s;erva|tions had appeared in news-papers and hand-bills. But no publication, that I have &s;een, has gone fully into the merits, con&s;idered the objections, and explained that, which is doubtful and ob&s;cure. On this account I, at length, made the attempt. That my performance is equal to my wi&s;hes, I can by no means believe. I have, however, a con&s;olation in reflecting, that it will be difficult for any man to demon&s;trate, that, in this bu&s;ine&s;s, I have a particular intere&s;t.&mdash;In many of my remarks, I have been anticipated by writings, which I have &s;een; and I have collected ma|terials,
<PB N="42" REF="021131_0040_0FB2493C93272320">
wherever I could find them. Could I be convinced, that I have &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d nothing, which had not before been &s;aid or thought by thou&s;ands, the reflection would yield far le&s;s mortification than plea&s;ure.</P>
