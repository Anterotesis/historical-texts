<P>THE following Amendment to the Bill providing the Means of Intercour&s;e between the United States and Foreign Nations, being under con&s;ideration, to wit:&mdash; In the Section which provides that <Q>the Pre&s;ident &s;hall not allow to any Mini&s;ter <HI>Plenipotentiary</HI> a greater &s;um than at the rate of nine thou&s;and dollars per annum, as a compen&s;ation for all his per&s;onal &s;ervices and other expen&s;es; nor a greater &s;um for the &s;ame than four thou&s;and five hundred dollars per annum, to <HI>a Charge des Affaires;</HI></Q> &s;trike out the word <HI>"Plenipotentiary,"</HI> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof the words <Q>to Great-Britain, France or Spain;</Q> &s;trike out the words <Q><HI>Charge des Affaires,</HI></Q> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof the words <Q>any Mini&s;ter to any other foreign nation:</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bayard</HI> DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING SPEECH:</P>
<P>I SHALL not follow the example of the gentleman who is ju&s;t &s;at down (Mr. R. Williams) in a&s;&s;igning rea&s;ons again&s;t the vote which I de&s;ign to give, but &s;hall content my&s;elf in &s;tating and maintaining the grounds upon which I am oppo&s;ed to the amendment under con|&s;ideration. I had thought and &s;till believe that the principles upon which gentlemen differ, are well under&s;tood. We do not deny the power of this Hou&s;e in the appropriation of money, nor the di&s;cre|tion which they may con&s;titutionally exerci&s;e in fixing the proper amount of &s;alary for a Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary, or for any other officer employed by the government. On the other hand, gentlemen who differ from us, do not contend that 9000 dollars per annum is too great a &s;alary for a Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary, but they &s;ay that no Mini&s;ter is nece&s;&s;ary at Berlin or Li&s;bon, and therefore they will not appropriate for their &s;upport. If this Hou&s;e has not a right to judge of the grade of Mini&s;ters, or of the places at which it is proper to employ them, no rea&s;on will remain for our refu&s;ing to appropriate in the manner contemplated by the bill in its original &s;hape.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="033383_0003_0FF6894848D8A218">
The fir&s;t que&s;tion, therefore, which naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf in this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, is whether the power of fixing the number and grade of foreign Mini&s;ters, belongs in any degree to this Hou&s;e, or exclu|&s;ively to the Executive.</P>
<P>By the Con&s;titution, the right of receiving foreign Mini&s;ters is given to the Pre&s;ident, nor is there any pretence under which this Hou&s;e can claim a &s;hare of that right or its incidents. The obligation to appoint foreign Mini&s;ters may frequently ari&s;e from the commu|nications they make to the power which receives them. The powers therefore of appointing and receiving &s;eem to me co-relative, and e&s;&s;entially to belong to the &s;ame branch of government.</P>
<P>But the power of appointing is as expre&s;sly given to the Pre&s;ident, as the power of receiving Mini&s;ters. As Mini&s;ters, however, cannot be employed abroad, without money being appropriated for their &s;upport, as money cannot be appropriated but by law, it is therefore &s;aid we may enquire into the propriety of the appointments before we appropriate.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I apprehend wherever an office, created by the con&s;ti|tution, or by law, is legally filled by the Pre&s;ident, that we are <HI>bound</HI> to provide a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for the officer. The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, however, has told us, that the office of foreign Mini&s;ter is created by the Pre&s;ident, and does not exi&s;t under the Con&s;titution. This is one of tho&s;e bold a&s;&s;ertions which we &s;o often hear from that quarter, and intended to impo&s;e upon the ea&s;y credulity of a part of the Hou&s;e. I a&s;k the gentleman whether the power of creating offices is of an Executive nature? And, if not, I beg him to point out to me the clau&s;e in the Con&s;titution which in any ca&s;e gives &s;uch a power to the Pre&s;ident? But in order to oppo&s;e the a&s;&s;ertion, I will beg leave to refer to the provi&s;ion of the Con&s;titution on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>[Mr. B. here read the following pa&s;&s;age from the 2d &s;ect. of the 2d art. of the Con&s;titution:&mdash;"He," the Pre&s;ident, "&s;hall nomi|nate, and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint Amba&s;&s;adors, other public Mini&s;ters and Con&s;uls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States <HI>who&s;e appointments are not herein otherwi&s;e provided for, and which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI>"]</P>
<P>By this clau&s;e it explicitly appears that the power of appointment extends only to offices provided by the Con&s;titution, or which af|terwards &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. The place of Mini&s;ter, then, is an office created by the Con&s;titution. But it is contended by this gentleman, that Mini&s;ters &s;tand upon the &s;ame ground with Judges of the Supreme Court, and, as we had limited the number of the latter, &s;o we have a right to re&s;train the number of the former. Now, Sir, by referring again to the Con&s;titution, I apprehend I can &s;hew, that the ca&s;es &s;tand on different grounds, and that there is a power given to us to interfere in the ca&s;e of Judges, which does not belong to us in the ca&s;e of Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="033383_0004_0FF6894A0EA586E8">
[Mr. B. here cited the 3d art. of the Con&s;titution, &s;ect. 1&s;t, as fol|lows:</P>
<P>"The judicial power of the United States &s;hall be ve&s;ted in one Supreme Court, and in &s;uch inferior as the <HI>Congre&s;s may from time to time e&s;tabli&s;h.</HI>"]</P>
<P>It appears from this clau&s;e, that a Supreme Court is provided, but the mode of its e&s;tabli&s;hment is expre&s;sly left to Congre&s;s. Be&s;ide, it is evident from the Con&s;titution, that the farmers of it frequently referred to things as known. As when they provide in criminal ca&s;es that the trial &s;hall be by jury, it was under&s;tood that the jury &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of twelve men, and a verdict be the unanimous opinion of the whole. And &s;o in the ca&s;e of the Supreme Court, that the number of Judges could not be indefinite, and of con&s;equence mu&s;t be limited by Congre&s;s. This is certainly not the ca&s;e as to foreign Mini&s;ters. Their number can be no more limited than the number of foreign powers. By le&s;&s;ening the number of independent nations (which is a work going on very fa&s;t) the con&s;titutional power of the Pre&s;ident on this &s;ubject will be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>If the doctrine be founded, that this Hou&s;e has a right to refu&s;e to appropriate for the &s;alary of foreign Mini&s;ters, I a&s;k gentlemen to reconcile it with their admi&s;&s;ion that no &s;uch right to refu&s;e exi&s;ts in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;ident or Judges? A di&s;tinction has been at|tempted. It is &s;aid, that in the ca&s;e of the&s;e officers, the Con&s;ti|tution has provided that their compen&s;ation &s;hall not be dimini&s;hed during their continuance in office. But it &s;trongly appears to me, and I do in&s;i&s;t, that by conceding that in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;ident and Judges we are <HI>bound</HI> to appropriate, the whole argument on the other &s;ide is given up. Becau&s;e it allows, that notwith&s;tanding we have an expre&s;s power on the &s;ubject of appropriation, that yet there are ca&s;es in which that power mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ively exerci&s;ed, without the u&s;e of the di&s;cretion which it is &s;trongly contended e&s;&s;entially belongs to it. And now, Sir, as to the di&s;tinction between Judges and Mini&s;ters, I beg leave to remark, that in the ca&s;e of Judges, the provi&s;ion of the Con&s;titution goes only to the <HI>quantum</HI> of the &s;alary, and prohibits the <HI>diminution</HI> of it during their continuance in office. But as to the <HI>principle</HI> that a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation &s;hall be allowed, the ca&s;es &s;tand on the &s;ame footing. The only difference is, that in the ca&s;e of the Judge we have not the power of &s;aying the <HI>&s;alary is too great,</HI> but we are bound to appropriate to the la&s;t farthing; where|as, in the ca&s;e of a Mini&s;ter, we have the right at all times of re|ducing the amount of his pay. I believe, Sir, it can hardly be de|nied, that when the framers of the Con&s;titution created an office, or gave a power to create one, and directed the office to be filled by the Pre&s;ident, that they contemplated a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation being provided for the officer. It was a thing &s;o well under&s;tood, that it would have been folly to have expre&s;&s;ed it, as great folly as to have provided that it &s;hould be the duty of the Judges to expound the law. And, therefore, I hold that in the ca&s;e of Mini&s;ters and all
<PB N="6" REF="033383_0005_0FF6894C8B96FAE0">other officers legally appointed, that this Hou&s;e is bound to concur in an appropriation for a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>In order to maintain their ground, gentlemen, on the other &s;ide, have de&s;canted largely on the &s;ubject of checks, and per&s;uaded them|&s;elves that the right to refu&s;e an appropriation in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;prung from the general &s;pirit of the Con&s;titution, which de&s;igned that one branch of the government &s;hould operate as a check upon another.</P>
<P>The doctrine as contended for, has emphatically been &s;tiled an <HI>imported doctrine,</HI> but I hope it will not be <HI>&s;muggled</HI> into this Hou&s;e without in&s;pection and examination. The ca&s;es of checks to be derived from the Con&s;titution, I apprehend may be cla&s;&s;ed under three heads.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Where an expre&s;s power is given to one branch to control the operations of another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Where a branch of the government ex|ceeds its powers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Where a general power is given to one branch, and a &s;ub&s;tantive power included within the terms of it given to another.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Thus, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e; in the Legi&s;lature, the Senate is a check upon this Hou&s;e, and this Hou&s;e upon the Senate, and the Pre&s;ident upon both. In the Executive, the Senate on the Pre|&s;ident, as to treaties and appointments. And in the Judiciary, one Court upon another. Upon the &s;econd head, a ca&s;e mentioned by the gentleman from Virginia, and much relied on, furni&s;hes a &s;trik|ing example. Even the Judges, the gentleman &s;aid, are a check upon the Legi&s;lature. This ari&s;es from the nature of the Legi&s;lature, the powers of which are limited. If the Legi&s;lature tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of their authority, their acts are void, and neither the people nor the Judges are bound by them. So if the Pre&s;ident &s;hould com|mi&s;&s;ion, after an appointment non-concurred by the Senate, the commi&s;&s;ion would be void. And in all ca&s;es where an act is done without power, a check may be found wherever we plea&s;e to look for it. The third ca&s;e which has been mentioned, is, where the general power of one branch is controlled by a particular power given to another branch. To this head may be a&s;&s;igned another ca&s;e much relied on by the gentleman from Virginia. The ca&s;e I refer to, is that of a treaty made by the Pre&s;ident having war for its ob|ject. Now, as the exclu&s;ive power to declare war is ve&s;ted in Con|gre&s;s, I have no he&s;itation in &s;aying, the Pre&s;ident has not the power to make a treaty of offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance. For though &s;uch a power may be embraced in the general terms giving the power to make treaties; yet, as the right to declare war is di&s;tinctly given to Congre&s;s, it mu&s;t operate as an exception to the general treaty-making power.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ca&s;es of legitimate checks which occur to me. But as to the wild doctrine which has been contended for, that wherever one branch of the government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any degree of power, that a di&s;cretion nece&s;&s;arily accompanies the exerci&s;e of it, nothing I con|ceive can be more dangerous, or have a more direct tendency to di&s;|o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="11 letters">. If the principle were a&s;&s;erted by each branch, the
<PB N="7" REF="033383_0006_0FF6894E8D427090">operations of the government mu&s;t cea&s;e. The Pre&s;ident might &s;ay, he was not bound blindly to execute laws which he conceived to be ab&s;ured or impolitic. We create offices, he refu&s;es to fill them; we appropriate money, he refu&s;es to apply it; we declare war, he refu&s;es to carry it on, becau&s;e, con&s;ulting his own judgment, he conceives our mea&s;ures to be unwi&s;e, and that it would be better for the coun|try to <HI>check</HI> us, by refu&s;ing the aid of his con&s;titutional power to carry our &s;chemes into effect. I will beg leave to put a ca&s;e which I conceive comes up to the &s;tronge&s;t point of the argument on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Congre&s;s declare war. This can be done by a majority of both Hou&s;es. The Pre&s;ident participates the power of appropriating money. Now &s;uppo&s;e war actually declared, by a power competent and expre&s;sly allowed to judge of its expediency, and the Pre&s;ident afterwards conceiving the war to be unju&s;t, or the declaration pre|mature, refu&s;es to concur in an appropriation to &s;upport it. In &s;uch ca&s;e, we &s;hould be con&s;titutionally at war, and con&s;titutionally re|&s;trained from carrying it on.</P>
<P>Such are the ab&s;urdities which flow from the <HI>imported doctrine</HI> of checks. Con&s;equences which tend to paralize the powers of the Con&s;titution, and effectually to <HI>&s;top the wheels of government.</HI></P>
<P>I have no doubt, Sir, for my own part, that this Hou&s;e has no right to interfere upon the principle of the amendment; but I will, notwith&s;tanding, con&s;ider the expediency of the mea&s;ure it con|templates.</P>
<P>It has been contended by the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, that it would be better for this country to renounce all foreign inter|cour&s;e. This, I conceive, is going far beyond any point of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion before the Committee. The amendment is not de&s;igned to aboli&s;h foreign intercour&s;e. It &s;uppo&s;es three Mini&s;ters Plenipo|tentiary, and as many Mini&s;ters Re&s;ident and Con&s;uls as the Pre|&s;ident &s;hall think proper to appoint. Indeed it affects only the grade of the Mini&s;ters at Li&s;bon and Berlin.</P>
<P>Sir, I could have wi&s;hed to avoid any imputation upon the mo|tives which produced the pre&s;ent amendment. But it &s;trikes me as &s;ingular that gentlemen &s;hould be &s;atisfied with re&s;training its ope|ration to two characters, and that &s;uch mighty efforts &s;hould be made to accompli&s;h an object attended with &s;o little &s;aving to the Trea&s;ury, and at be&s;t equivocal, as they mu&s;t acknowledge, as to its operation abroad. I cannot well account for what I have &s;een, but in recol|lecting that the Mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon was formerly a di&s;tingui&s;hed mem|ber of this Hou&s;e, who&s;e eminent talents having been employed in the &s;upport of government, has rendered him obnoxious to the friends of the amendment; and that the Mini&s;ter at Berlin is the &s;on of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, a man as much hated by one party as venerated by the other. I &s;hould have been willing to have di&s;carded any &s;u&s;picions which the&s;e recollections occa&s;ioned, had I been able to di&s;cover any plau&s;ible rea&s;on at this time for introducing and &s;o &s;trongly maintaining the amendment.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033383_0007_0FF6891D3959EA50">
Gentlemen have talked of annihilating foreign intercour&s;e. Do they call to their minds our &s;ea coa&s;t of 1700 miles? Do they remem|ber the commercial temper and habits of our people? Do they re|collect how many imported articles, though perhaps once luxuries, are now become nece&s;&s;aries of life? Do they calculate the portion of our food and raiment which is brought acro&s;s the ocean? Can they &s;it down to a meal in the day, or examine the cloths on their backs, without being &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trength of our foreign connec|tions? I beg gentlemen, after having duly appreciated the&s;e con|&s;iderations, to tell whether they &s;eriou&s;ly imagine that any force in the government could break our connection with foreign countries. I believe, for my part, that while the ocean is navigable, that our people will be commercial, and that foreign connections cannot be prevented. The only que&s;tion which &s;eems to me to exi&s;t is, whe|ther, as there will be intercour&s;e with foreign countries, it does not admit of beneficial regulations from the interference of govern|ment.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania has con&s;idered this &s;ubject un|der two heads, <HI>commercial</HI> and <HI>political,</HI> and has endeavoured to &s;hew, that our connections with Europe, commercial or political, do not require a diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Commercial intercour&s;e, he continues, might be as well regulated and protected by the employment of Con&s;uls as of Mini&s;ters. Very little con&s;ideration, I apprehend, will &s;atisfy gentlemen, that Con|&s;uls are inadequate to the protection of the commerce of a great country. Con&s;uls are little more than private mercantile agents. They are frequently the &s;ubjects of the country in which they are &s;tationed, &s;ubject to its laws, as well in civil as in criminal ca&s;es, not privileged, and &s;carcely noticed by the law of nations, and re|pre&s;enting, in no degree, the country which employs them. I will then a&s;k, if Con&s;uls are competent to in&s;i&s;t upon the rights of the nation, or its citizens, or to remon&s;trate again&s;t their wrongs. Whether they could demand, or are &s;o likely to obtain ju&s;tice, as if they were cloathed with a repre&s;entative capacity of the country. Be&s;ide, let me tell the gentleman, that if our e&s;tabli&s;hment abroad were reduced to Con&s;uls, in effect, they would only have foreign Mini&s;ters under new names, for they would &s;oon be employed for political, as well as commercial purpo&s;es. It would end in their exerci&s;ing the powers of Mini&s;ters, without their re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania has &s;aid, that the only u&s;e of Mini&s;ters is to form treaties. This is certainly not true. I con|ceive that a government is bound to extend its care and protection to its citizens abroad, as well as at home. One purpo&s;e, therefore, of Mini&s;ters is, to &s;ecure to our citizens in foreign countries, the rights which they derived from treaties, or the law of nations. They are de&s;igned al&s;o to watch the actions of foreign governments, and to di&s;cover their &s;chemes, and to give notice to their own govern|ment of any thing which may threaten the peace or &s;afety of their country. They are again the organ of communication between go|vernments,
<PB N="9" REF="033383_0008_0FF6895101730C48">by which explanations are demanded, and by which accidental differences may frequently be avoided without the extre|mity of war.</P>
<P>When the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania &s;poke of our political connections he &s;poke of tho&s;e ari&s;ing from treaties. He conceived that we had no occa&s;ion for treaties with foreign countries, and of con&s;equence that Mini&s;ters were not wanted to frame them. Upon this ground I will now meet him. It &s;eems to have e&s;caped the ob|&s;ervation of the gentleman and his friends, that we have a choice only of one of two grounds upon which we will &s;tand in relation to Europe. The one is the treaty, the other the law of nations. If we will not &s;ubject our&s;elves to treaties, we mu&s;t &s;till be bound by the law of nations. To me it appears much more rational, that na|tions &s;hould agree on the terms upon which their intercour&s;e &s;hall be conducted, than to leave it to the determination of a law derived from authorities uncertain, ambiguous and contradictory. Treaties are de&s;igned to &s;upply the defects, and explain the doubts of the law. They di&s;pen&s;e with a rule injurious perhaps to both countries, and introduce a regulation equally beneficial to each party. If di&s;|putes ari&s;e in the con&s;truction of treaties, which are expre&s;&s;ed with all the caution of &s;tudied language, how much more contention is to be expected upon the law of nations&mdash;a law con&s;i&s;ting in loo&s;e cu&s;|tom, ari&s;ing from the dicta of authors, who&s;e opinions were warped by the peculiar intere&s;t of their country&mdash;a law, the general prin|ciples of which may be perverted to ju&s;tify every act of power how|ever flagitious?</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, in order to &s;upport his po&s;ition on this &s;ubject, has ca&s;t his eyes upon our treaties, and &s;elected tho&s;e parts which he thought he could reprobate with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. And the &s;ubject was probably introduced for the purpo&s;e of giving him an opportunity of doing &s;o.</P>
<P>I am not, however, alarmed at meeting the gentleman upon this ground, and enquiring into the advantages and evils which have re|&s;ulted from treaties which we have formed.</P>
<P>The gentleman has not given him&s;elf the trouble of adverting to any treaty, or to any one article in a treaty, by which the country has been benefited. It has &s;erved his purpo&s;e to exhibit the dark &s;ide of the picture.</P>
<P>The gentleman has even complained of the treaty with France, and &s;poke of the di&s;putes which the con&s;truction of it has involved us in. Nothing could a&s;toni&s;h me more than that that gentleman and his friends &s;hould complain of this treaty. I cannot help pitying the &s;hort memory which allows them to forget the language they held on a former occa&s;ion, removed from us but by a &s;mall interval of time. At the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this Congre&s;s, we were told by tho&s;e gentlemen, that it was to our treaty with France that we owed the liberty and independence of our country, and we were &s;trongly reminded of the debt of gratitude which remained un|paid. Will tho&s;e gentlemen now tell us, that the evils which re|&s;ult from that very treaty, overbalance its advantages? If &s;o, we are to be grateful when we have been more injured than bene|fited.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not be repelled by any popular prejudice from &s;aying, that advantages have been derived from the Briti&s;h treaty. I con&s;ider
<PB N="10" REF="033383_0009_0FF688F3A18B4BA8">the war from which that treaty pre&s;erved us of an importance incal|culable. A war which mu&s;t have annihilated our commerce, de&s;o|lated our &s;ea-port towns, ruined our finances, while it encrea&s;ed our debt, depre&s;&s;ed the value of our produce, and of the labour of our citizens, and multiplying the burthens of the government, while it dimini&s;hed the ability of the people to &s;upport it, might have ended in the lo&s;s of our Con&s;titution, and of our unity and independence as a nation. No &s;acrifice which we have made, can be put in the &s;cale again&s;t the evils which we have e&s;caped. That every treaty will be compo&s;ed of conce&s;&s;ion, as well as of acqui&s;ition, every rea|&s;onable man will expect. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a powerful nation will grant any thing and a&s;k nothing in return.</P>
<P>[Mr. Gallatin explained by &s;aying, that nothing which he &s;aid, had any relation to our treaty of alliance with France, but merely to commercial treaties.]</P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;I under&s;tood the gentleman to &s;ay, that he was aver&s;e from all foreign intercour&s;e, and generally that our treaties had been injurious to the country. But even if his &s;trictures were confined to commercial treaties, yet as the que&s;tion regards generally our fo|reign connections, it is proper that political advantages derived from our treaties &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration. I have &s;poken of one benefit which might be attributed to the treaty with Great-Britain. I will mention another. That treaty has given us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, which for years have been &s;o cruel a thorn in our &s;ide, which have co&s;t us &s;o many millions of dollars, and &s;o much blood. Again, the treaty has provided for our mercantile brethren a compen&s;ation in ca&s;e of illegal capture of their property by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els during the pre&s;ent war, and rein&s;tated familes that otherwi&s;e would have been irreparably ruined.</P>
<P>One provi&s;ion in the treaty, is a &s;triking in&s;tance of the nece&s;&s;ity of treaties. It has made provi&s;ion that our northern boundary &s;hall be amicably fixed by a&s;certaining the true river St. Croix. Had we been left to the law of nations to fix this boundary, as each country would have in&s;i&s;ted on its preten&s;ions, force mu&s;t have &s;ettled the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>I will next a&s;k, whether the country has derived no advantage from the Spani&s;h treaty? Whether nothing was gained by the &s;ur|render of &s;everal armed po&s;ts, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our &s;outhern boundary, the &s;e&s;&s;ion of a large territory, and the acqui&s;ition of the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi? And I particularly beg gentle|men to point out the evils which balance the benefits of this treaty?</P>
<P>It is plain to me, that foreign intercour&s;e cannot be prevented, and equally plain that treaties nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e out of that intercour&s;e. But at this moment, of all others, I conceive that the amendment to the bill, which goes to re&s;train the appointment of Mini&s;ters Pleni|potentiary to London, Paris and Madrid, is peculiarly improper. Sir, the me&s;&s;age of this day laid on our table from the Pre&s;ident, in|forms us of the critical and dangerous &s;tate of our country. It in|forms us al&s;o, that the intere&s;ts of other neutral nations, are impli|cated in the inju&s;tice of the decree which is about to pa&s;s the French Councils. We have &s;uffered, and are &s;uffering, aggre&s;&s;ions from a power undoubtedly formidable, which menace the peace and &s;afety of the country. We have been driven to the brink of war, and
<PB N="11" REF="033383_0010_0FF689542D5456F0">&s;hould the Mighty Republic (which God forbid) force us to ho&s;ti|lities, I hope we &s;hall have &s;en&s;e enough to increa&s;e our &s;trength by an alliance with tho&s;e neutral nations, with whom it may be found that we have a common intere&s;t. I tru&s;t that the &s;pirit of the coun|try is not &s;o broken by the humiliations to which we have already &s;ubmitted, and that the pa&s;&s;ion for wealth has &s;o far extingui&s;hed every nobler feeling, that we are prepared tamely to &s;ubmit our necks to the yoke, and barter the liberty and independence of the country for a &s;tate of peace, as inglorious as it is in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, in his argument again&s;t foreign intercour&s;e, alledged, that we had nothing to do with the balance of power in Europe. I believe, Sir, I can refer the Committee to ca&s;es which will &s;atisfy both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e that we are intimately con|nected with that balance. I will call to the recollection of gentlemen oppo&s;ed to me, that period of the war when the Duke of Brun&s;wick was marching to Paris, when the rebels were &s;ucce&s;sful in La Vendee, when Toulon was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the combined powers, when vic|tory &s;eemed to have declared for the allied princes, and Fate to have numbered the days of the Republic, and a&s;k them whether they were not then &s;en&s;ible of the balance of power in Europe being de&s;troyed? Was there a gentleman among them, who did not attribute the ag|gre&s;&s;ions of England to the depre&s;&s;ion of the power of France? But when the fortune of war changed&mdash;the Duke of Brun&s;wick re|treated, Toulon re-captured, the Netherlands &s;ubdued, Holland invaded&mdash;to this change have they not &s;aid it was owing that the famous decree of November, 1793, was revoked, and that the &s;torm which was gathering round us, was di&s;per&s;ed?</P>
<P>At that time, in what manner did the Republic behave towards us? Did they recal their own Mini&s;ters, or bani&s;h our's? Did they invent pretences to de&s;troy our commerce? On the contrary, did they not invite us to draw clo&s;er the bands of alliance? But, Sir, &s;ince the full tide of pro&s;perity has ri&s;en in favor of France; &s;ince &s;he has added millions of men to her population, and of money to her revenue; &s;ince &s;he has humbled the crowns of half the Potentates of Europe, and rendered many of them her tributaries; &s;ince &s;he has found her&s;elf able to break the pillars of governments which had la&s;ted for centuries, and to erect new &s;tates upon their ruins; &s;ince, in fine, &s;he has perceived that there is no weight in Europe to balance her power, has not this country felt the effect of the mighty change? Gentlemen cannot deny that the &s;y&s;tem which England formerly pur|&s;ued, France has &s;ince adopted, with circum&s;tances of increa&s;ed ag|gravation! When I regard the facts which a &s;hort period of time pre&s;ents to our eyes, I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that we have nothing to do with the balance of power in Europe.</P>
<P>I will now call the attention of the committee to &s;ome points in|troduced into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which were principal grounds of argu|ment with the gentleman who moved the amendment, but which have lo&s;t much of their importance in the cour&s;e of the debate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was Executive patronage. This was attacked on two principles.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it had increa&s;ed, and ought to be dimini&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it had been, and was de&s;igned to be abu&s;ed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I hope it will be remembered, that the attempt on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion is not to add to the patronage of the Pre&s;ident, but to take from the Executive a power, which it is not denied, belongs to him under the con&s;titution. The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania not only
<PB N="12" REF="033383_0011_0FF689571635C698">admitted that a power to fill the office belonged to the Pre&s;ident, but a&s;&s;erted that the Pre&s;ident had power to create the office it&s;elf; &s;o that the que&s;tion is, as to pre&s;erving, and not as to increa&s;ing the con&s;titutional power of the Executive.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that when I expre&s;&s;ed an opinion, that the Executive was the weake&s;t branch of Govern|ment, it was with <HI>regret;</HI> and thence, came to an ea&s;y conclu&s;ion, that it was my de&s;ign to promote Monarchy in this country. I am at a lo&s;s to know how that gentleman di&s;covered my feelings when I delivered the opinion. But is was nece&s;&s;ary to his purpo&s;e to attri|bute tho&s;e feelings to me, and that gentleman has no weak delicacy, as to the means, when he has a purpo&s;e to accompli&s;h. I did indeed &s;ay, that the Executive was the weake&s;t branch of the Government, and this I repeat; but I neither &s;aid it with joy nor &s;orrow, but &s;tated it as a fact. I did not &s;ay that the Executive was <HI>too weak,</HI> nor expre&s;&s;ed any wi&s;h that its power &s;hould be encrea&s;ed. Suppo&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay, that the Pope is the weake&s;t Potentate in Europe, would it follow, from thence, that I wi&s;hed the territories of his Holine&s;s extended, or his power enlarged to a balance with that of the mighty Republic? Or, if I affirmed, of the two &s;exes that the female was the weake&s;t, is it to be concluded that I regret that wo|man is not as &s;trong as man? I believe the Executive is at the mercy of this Hou&s;e; that if the Hou&s;e were united, and re&s;olved to bind the hands of the Executive, no re&s;i&s;tance could prevent them; but I do not apprehend that any effort of Executive authority could make an impre&s;&s;ion on the rights of this Hou&s;e. Nay, it is even ob&s;erva|able that <HI>feeble minorities</HI> can &s;hake the foundations of Executive au|thority, though &s;upported by a majority of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Another gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Findley) has al&s;o thought proper to infer, from the compari&s;on I made between the patronage of our Executive and that of the Crown of Great-Britain, that I am de&s;irous of &s;eeing the patronage of the Pre&s;ident encrea&s;ed to the magnitude of that of the Engli&s;h King.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;urprizing that this gentleman, who profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf the model of candour and moderation in the opening of his &s;peech, &s;hould &s;uffer him&s;elf to be guilty of &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion. The true inference from my argument is directly the rever&s;e of the one which has been made. I ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding all the patronage which the King of England derives from the nobility, the church, the army, navy, civil li&s;t, &amp;c. that the Monarchy could not be pre&s;erved, if the principle of equal repre&s;entation were introduced into the Hou&s;e of Commons. I have no objection to u&s;e the obnoxious expre&s;&s;ion attributed to me, that if the venal boroughs were aboli&s;hed, there would &s;oon be an end of the Monarchy.</P>
<P>I do not believe there is a man of &s;en&s;e on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e of a different opinion. But this opinion is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with a wi&s;h to &s;ee the Monarchy de&s;troyed. It is an opinion &s;imply upon the operation of certain cau&s;es, and their tendency to produce certain effects, which has no connection with the wi&s;hes of the per&s;on who forms it.</P>
<P>I am very ready to confe&s;s, that I am not one of tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts who&s;e in&s;atiable thir&s;t for liberty allows them to wi&s;h the de&s;olation of a country, and the ma&s;&s;acre of its inhabitants, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h in it a new form of government. If the Engli&s;h love their Monarch,
<PB N="13" REF="033383_0012_0FF688F96F8B5748">I have no objection to their living under Monarchy. It is enough for me, that I live in a Republic: and if the people of England will &s;uffer us to live in peace, under the government of our choice, we cannot be ju&s;tified in wi&s;hing to &s;ee the throats of half the nation cut, and their property plundered, in order that a government may be there e&s;tabli&s;hed more conformable to our ta&s;te.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I have no intere&s;t out of the country, nor in a form of government different from what we po&s;&s;e&s;s. I was bred during the revolutionary war, and my fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions were republican. No man can have le&s;s motive to wi&s;h a monarchical government; and being completely &s;atisfied with the exi&s;ting government, I am di&s;|po&s;ed to repel every innovation upon it, from whatever quarter it comes.</P>
<P>But, Sir, is it for tho&s;e gentlemen who were born under monar|chical, or corrupt governments of Europe, who&s;e necks were early broke to the yoke, who&s;e germ of republicani&s;m is engrafted on a monarchical &s;tock, to bring forward the charges of ari&s;tocracy? I think, if the &s;incerity of their apo&s;tacy is not que&s;tioned, it becomes them to be &s;ilent as to others. I tru&s;t, however, that the people of the United States have &s;en&s;e enough to judge men, not by their <HI>profe&s;&s;ions of faith,</HI> but by their <HI>actions.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Sir, I am &s;o far from dreading Executive patronage, that I do not believe that any power which can be given to the Pre|&s;ident, will render him dangerous to this Hou&s;e, while it is compo&s;ed of Repre&s;entatives equally and freely cho&s;en by the people. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e that a Pre&s;ident is exempt from ambition, or indifferent as to power; but while the people have the power of purging this Hou&s;e every two years, and regard it as them&s;elves, there is no pa|tronage which can corrupt it, nor Executive power which can threaten it. Give to the Executive every officer of the government, and every man whom they can influence, and what is the weight in the &s;cale again&s;t the body of the people?</P>
<P>The charge of ari&s;tocracy brought again&s;t me, and tho&s;e with whom I act, I look on as a &s;pectre conjured up to alarm timid ima|ginations. If, indeed, the charge had been made again&s;t the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, there might be &s;ome ground to believe it. Again&s;t men born in land of &s;lavery, who&s;e cradles have been rocked by &s;laves, and who have been habituated, from infancy, to trample on the rights of man. Sir, when I look round this hall, and ob&s;erve how parties are compo&s;ed; when I &s;ee men who come from a land of real equality, many of whom have been educated in laborious em|ployments, and none of whom can boa&s;t but a few paternal acres, and find that they are called Ari&s;tocrats, while, on the other hand, men who can count in their train a hundred &s;laves, who&s;e large do|mains, like feudal baronies, are peopled with the humble&s;t ve&s;&s;els, are &s;tiled Democrats, I am a&s;toni&s;hed that the weake&s;t of mankind can be impo&s;ed on by &s;uch an abu&s;e of words. I know that this is a de|licate &s;ubject, and I wi&s;hed to have avoided it; but, when I &s;ee the&s;e High Prie&s;ts of Liberty &s;o zealou&s;ly proclaiming freedom with one hand, while they are riveting the chains of &s;lavery with the other, I cannot forbear tearing a&s;ide the veil which conceals the truth from the world.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania has amu&s;ed us by de&s;canting on the hi&s;tories of Greece and Rome, and a&s;&s;igning cau&s;es of the downfal
<PB N="14" REF="033383_0013_0FF68958D2664BF0">of tho&s;e Republics. The&s;e are di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which, for my part, I con|ceive had better be left to the &s;chools and lyceums; but &s;ince the &s;ub|ject has been introduced, I beg leave &s;imply to remark, the admi&s;&s;ion of the gentleman, that tho&s;e republics were de&s;troyed, not by Exe|cutive encroachments, but by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people. This is an admi&s;&s;ion of every thing in di&s;pute on the &s;ubject. Becau&s;e it proves, that the people were the in&s;truments made u&s;e of to de&s;troy republics. Were I an enemy to the free government of my country, I &s;hould not &s;eek to &s;ubvert it, by &s;upporting, or in attempting by artful con&s;tructions of the Con&s;titution to increa&s;e Executive power. If a project of this kind could be finally &s;ucce&s;sful, it would require centuries to accompli&s;h it. No, Sir, I would adopt the means which have produced the effect before. The people would be the in&s;trument I &s;hould make u&s;e of, I would addre&s;s my&s;elf to their prejudices, their follies, and their pa&s;&s;ions. I would tell them that the govern|ment is corrupt; that it is a faction under the influence, or in the pay, of a foreign power. I would tell them, that their intere&s;ts are neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed, that hence they are burthened with grievous exci&s;e laws and odious &s;tamp acts.</P>
<P>I would call upon them to erect <HI>liberty poles,</HI> and refu&s;e obedience to a government which is admini&s;tered by an <HI>ari&s;tocratic junto.</HI> And could I be &s;ucce&s;sful in the&s;e artful calumnies, and deluding a well|meaning people, excite them to in&s;urrection and rebellion again&s;t the laws, I might hope to &s;ee one of the be&s;t governments in the world torn to pieces, and a wretched people burying their liberties in its ruins.</P>
<P>From ancient, we were brought to the modern hi&s;tory of Europe, and we are told, that, except in England, from which we have re|ceived the germ of liberty, every &s;emblance of repre&s;entation has been &s;wallowed up in the Executive power.</P>
<P>But I will a&s;k the gentleman, whether the Cortes of Spain, or the Parliaments and Councils of which he &s;poke, repre&s;ented the people, or were not connected in intere&s;t with the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety alone. Tho&s;e &s;hadows of repre&s;entation were de&s;troyed, becau&s;e the people deriving no benefit from them, had no motive to &s;upport them. But in England, where the body of the people were repre&s;ented, though imperfectly, the popular branch grew up in the very &s;hade of de&s;poti&s;m. This vital principle of liberty &s;urvived the tyranny of Henry 8th, and the power of Elizabeth. It &s;oon gave a weight to the Commons which balanced the power of the Crown. The Engli&s;h hi&s;tory &s;trongly proves the principle for which I contend, that the branch of government connected in intere&s;t with the people, and &s;upported by them, has nothing to fear from Executive power.</P>
<P>Is there any in&s;tance in this hi&s;tory, of the Hou&s;e of Commons be|ing aboli&s;hed by the crown? And, on the contrary, have you not &s;een the Commons able to &s;ubvert the Throne and Nobility, to extort, at &s;ome times, from the King his mo&s;t precious prerogatives, and at all times to force on him mini&s;ters of their choice, or from him tho&s;e who were his favorites? The very corruption which the gentleman &s;poke of, proves the weakne&s;s of the crown, and the &s;trength of the Commons. It was not on the army, the navy, or the nobility, the crown could rely; it was obliged to purcha&s;e the &s;upport of the Com|mons. It was a purcha&s;e made upon the &s;ame principle of weakne&s;s, that we pay for the peace we enjoy with the we&s;tern &s;avages, or the Barbary powers.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="033383_0014_0FF6895B8F27FD58">
But the gentleman has gone &s;o far as to contend, that from the na|ture of their re&s;pective duties, that this Hou&s;e is more liable to incur popular odium than the Executive. That being obliged to impo&s;e taxes, often of an obnoxious kind, we are peculiarly expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the people. In making this remark, the gentleman cer|tainly forgot, that tho' we lay the taxes, it is the Executive which col|lects them. And that it is not &s;o much the letter of a tax law which is offen&s;ive to the people, as the hand of the tax gatherer, which compels them to pay. I apprehend, however, that the ob&s;ervation is wholly unfounded. The connection between this Hou&s;e and the people is too intimate, a common intere&s;t binds them too clo&s;ely toge|ther, to &s;uffer the remark of the gentleman to be verified. I can con|ceive it more than po&s;&s;ible that individuals of this body may lo&s;e their popularity by voting for mea&s;ures from which their con&s;tituents are aver&s;e; but in reprobating the conduct of a part of the Hou&s;e, who acted again&s;t their wi&s;hes, their affections will accumulate in favor of tho&s;e who&s;e conduct was conformable to their &s;entiments. When the Senate ratified the Briti&s;h treaty, they were not in con&s;equence le&s;s popular as a body. For tho' a majority, perhaps, were burnt in effigy, yet the <HI>virtuous ten</HI> acquired all the favor which they lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The gentleman has laboriou&s;ly provided for us an account of the amount of Executive patronage. The fees of every deputy's deputy are collected in the e&s;timate, in order to increa&s;e the dimen&s;ions of the phantom. The &s;alaries, compen&s;ations and fees, to per&s;ons in &s;ervice of the government, are &s;tated to amount to 850.000 dollars. This to be &s;ure, is a frightful &s;um di&s;tributed over &s;uch an immen&s;e country. But the fact is, that this money is hardly earned. No &s;ervices are &s;o badly paid for as tho&s;e which are rendered to the public. The &s;y&s;tem which is pur&s;uing will &s;tarve all talents and merit out of the govern|ment.</P>
<P>I believe that &s;everal offices are held from patriotic principles alone. I believe that a favor is done the government by every man of talents who accepts an office, and I am convinced that no man can turn his abilities and indu&s;try to le&s;s account than in accepting of places which the government is di&s;po&s;ed to give him. The contracts of the govern|ment have been &s;tated at 1,300 000 dollars. But the gentleman has cautiou&s;ly concealed the idea of equivalent received by the govern|ment. Suppo&s;ing a profit of 5 per cent. to the contractor, the a|mount of this branch of patronage does not exceed 65,000 dollars. And this is to compen&s;ate an advance of capital and per&s;onal &s;ervice. I be|lieve it may be &s;afely affirmed, that our government derives little in|fluence from this &s;ource.</P>
<P>An abu&s;e of Executive power has been loudly complained of, in a determination attributed to the Pre&s;ident to appoint none to office who do not profe&s;s his political creed. That the Pre&s;ident has determined to employ no more the enemies of the government, I think very pro|bable. Men perpetually oppo&s;ed to the admini&s;tration, who indi&s;cri|minately condemn every mea&s;ure adopted, who in&s;iduou&s;ly labour to alienate the affections of the people from the government, who, ab|&s;orbed in a fanatical attachment to a foreign country, have lo&s;t all re|gard for their own, I conceive are properly avoided as objects of pub|lic tru&s;t and confidence.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident, on this &s;ubject, will act on a principle from which the people never depart. In chu&s;ing the electors who appointed him,
<PB N="16" REF="033383_0015_0FF688F560E42A80">did they not exact, where they had not a perfect knowledge, a decla|ration of the political creed of the candidate? Does not every electi|on bear witne&s;s, that the principle is ever adhered to by the people? and I will a&s;k gentlemen, if any officer appointed by the Pre&s;ident were left to the choice of the people; if his politics would not be the fir&s;t object of their attention, and an invincible objection if different from their own? But, Sir, there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the principle is carried to the extent, &s;o warmly fancied by a gentleman from Vir|ginia (Mr. Brent) "that the Executive will employ no one who will not &s;ing hallelujahs to every executive object." No, Sir, I &s;hould pre|&s;ume that the determination of the Pre&s;ident reaches only to tho&s;e, who&s;e patrioti&s;m con&s;i&s;t in denouncing their own government, and applauding a foreign one; who celebrates with feats and &s;ongs, &s;ucce&s;&s;es which exalts another country upon the humiliation of their own; and who, pur&s;uing a phantom which they call liberty, forget that they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the freedom which rational men can wi&s;h, and are willing to &s;ubvert every thing which is valuable in &s;ociety, in or|der to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem under which every thing po&s;&s;ibly might be hoped for, but nothing certainly could be enjoyed.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for &s;aying a word as to the reflections, it has been &s;aid, we have ca&s;t upon the foreigners who are members of the hou&s;e. I certainly am not one of tho&s;e who would deny the rights of ho&s;pitality to any foreigners who &s;hall plea&s;e to come among us. I do not know that I have any objection to their acquiring the rights of citizen&s;hip; but I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, that, in my opinion, no man who was born in a foreign country, can love America equally with a native American. I do believe there is &s;uch a thing as a love of our native &s;oil; and a man who can di&s;card a love for the land which gave him birth will never have much affection for the country which adopts him. However, if in looking round this hou&s;e, I could di&s;|cover a &s;olitary proof again&s;t my po&s;ition, I might be led to doubt it; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that my ob&s;ervations on this floor have confirm|ed the opinion.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania concluded, with telling us, that he had but two objects in view; the one to de&s;troy foreign intercour&s;e, the other to &s;ave money. As to the fir&s;t, were it po&s;&s;ible I might join with him; and, as to the la&s;t, I believe I perfectly under&s;tand the gentleman. It was a fine declaration to tickle the ears of his con&s;titu|ents, I &s;hould certainly offend tho&s;e of mine were I to deliver a diffe|rent &s;entiment. But &s;till we differ on this head. I believe the gen|tleman &s;o &s;incere in what he &s;aid, &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to act up to it, that he would readily agree, not only to &s;ave money, but to &s;pend no mo|ney at all. I believe he would agree to look the doors of the trea&s;ury, and to throw the keys into the ocean. I believe he would con&s;ent to &s;tarve every man out of office: and then, I believe, the con&s;equence would be, that the wheels of government would be &s;topt.</P>
<P>For my part, tho' I value money, I certainly value the liberty and independence of the country more; and as I believe that tho&s;e objects cannot be better &s;ecured than by &s;upporting the be&s;t government in the world; and as I know that that government cannot be &s;upported with|out the expenditure of money, I &s;hall certainly never be &s;o far carried away by the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;aving, as to refu&s;e an appropriation of money required for any nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e of government, and e&s;pecially in a ca&s;e where I cannot refu&s;e without violating the Con&s;titution.</P>
