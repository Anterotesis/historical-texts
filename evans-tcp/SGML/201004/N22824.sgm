<HEAD>AN <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> OF AN IMPRISONMENT IN THE BASTILLE, FOR UPWARDS OF TWENTY YEARS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER an impri&s;onment of more than twen|ty years, during which time I was whol|ly precluded the u&s;e of pen, paper, books, and even the po&s;&s;ibility of hearing the articulation of a &s;ingle human voice, the reader will not, I hope, expect any very elegant detail of my mis|fortunes. My object is truth; my &s;econdary ob|ject I mean, for &s;uch, in truth, I ought to call it, my fir&s;t object being to procure my&s;elf a mor|&s;el of bread, and which I hope to be able to procure from the publication of my dreadful and almo&s;t unparalleled misfortunes:</P>
<P>One would indeed imagine, that, during &s;o long a &s;tate of total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, the natural and unavoidable con&s;equence mu&s;t have been, an intire lo&s;s of the u&s;e of language, reading, and writing: neither of the&s;e, howev|er,
<PB N="4" REF="030151_0003_0FE4AE1D8DAB1988">
in any great degree failed me. In the more fortunate, or rather in the more early part of my life (for I never recollect fortune to have been over and above kind to me) my education had been good, and my application, by no means, incon&s;iderable: And during the whole of my infamous impri&s;onment, as &s;oon at lea&s;t, as I had tolerably well got over the fir&s;t &s;hock of my unhappy &s;ituation, I continued to conver&s;e by my&s;elf, and very frequently to practice writing, or rather the formation of letters, upon the wall of my cell.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to give the melancholy ac|count of my being conducted to Pri&s;on, it will not be improper to inform the reader of the cau&s;e of my being &s;ent there: although, in fact, no cau&s;e was a&s;&s;igned&mdash;but I was accu&s;ed&mdash;and, in France, to be accu&s;ed is to be guilty.</P>
<P>I was in London when the conte&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mr. Wilkes, or rather between the Public, and the then Mini&s;ters of State, con|cerning the abolition of General Warrants. And as I came over to England wholly for plea&s;ure, and as London was at that time a &s;cene of riot and confu&s;ion, in which my interference would have beeen u&s;ele&s;s and impertinent, I re|turned to France after a few weeks, with a full re&s;olution to vi&s;it that glorious city, when I &s;hould be able to pa&s;s my time there more to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Shortly after my return to France, I went to &s;pend a few days with a friend in the neighbour|hood of Paris, who, among&s;t other &s;ervants had
<PB REF="030151_0004_0FE4AE20096D2988">
an Engli&s;h Groom who waited upon us at his table. This Groom, having been four years and upwards in France, was as capable of un|der&s;tanding, and al&s;o of &s;peaking the French language, as a native. Among&s;t other topics the conver&s;ation of cour&s;e turned upon my late excur&s;ion to England, and the effort the nation was then making to aboli&s;h <HI>General Warrants,</HI> which I de&s;cribed to the company, as nearly analogous to <HI>Lettres de Cachet.</HI></P>
<P>Being, as I thought, among&s;t friends, the con|ver&s;ation was free and without re&s;traint, and I believe &s;ome very &s;evere &s;trictures were impru|dently made by me, in particular, on Lettres de Cachet. And here the matter probably would have ended, had not the Engli&s;h Groom entered upon a fre&s;h di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it in the &s;ervants hall. In &s;hort, from words they came to blows, and the interference of the ma&s;ter and his company became nece&s;&s;ary: the Valet, who, as he &s;aid, had received a blow from the Groom, had drawn out his knife, and had, beyond a doubt put an end to his adver&s;ary's exi&s;tence, had I not very fortunately &s;ecured his arm: whereupon turning, in an in&s;tant, from extreme rage, to extreme coolne&s;s, he let fall the knife, and muttered to him&s;elf with a very &s;oft and low voice <Q>Well, I may perhaps find a better weapon for my purpo&s;e el&s;ewhere.</Q> Firing at this, the Groom imprudently uttered much har&s;h lan|guage and &s;everal execrations again&s;t the Police: however, by the authority of my friend, and by the pe&s;ua&s;ion of my&s;elf and the re&s;t of the com|pany, the Valet &s;eemed to be tolerably pacified; in con&s;equence of which he was prevailed upon
<PB N="6" REF="030151_0005_0FE4AE2893F081E8">
to &s;hake hands with the Groom. I &s;hall never forget the frankne&s;s and openne&s;s with which the Groom &s;hook him by the hand, nor the ma|licious &s;ignificant look of the Valet.</P>
<P>The reconciliation on the part of the Valet was external only; the Groom I believe gener|ou&s;ly declared his real &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The next morning the Valet a&s;ked his Ma&s;t|er's permi&s;&s;ion to go to his father at Paris, who, he &s;aid was dying: &s;hould he find him better, he would return by one o'clock, but &s;hould he find him wor&s;e, or dead, he hoped to be permitted to make a longer &s;tay. As he was not returned by ten o'clock at night; we were ob&s;erving that his father was probably wor&s;e or dead. But, alas, no &s;ooner had the ob&s;ervation been made, than the villain arrived with an officer of the Police and a large party of &s;oldiers. Not a &s;ingle word was &s;poken: I never remember a more dreadful &s;ilence! the Valet put the right hand of the Groom into the right hand of the Officer of Pol|ice: nor even then was a word exchanged on either &s;ide. The party went off with their booty, the execrable Valet attending them.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned in my friend's hou&s;e, by this dreadful circum&s;tance, may be better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed: what had my friend to expect but to be &s;acrificed to the fury of an angry and malicious Valet. However, af|ter the &s;econd night, he received a letter from the &s;ervant "de&s;iring his arrear of wages, and a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time that <HI>him&s;elf and his family were &s;afe.</HI>" The words being mark|ed,
<PB N="7" REF="030151_0006_0FE4AE2A2D87BB30">
were emphatical, and manife&s;tly carried with them an implication. As I was the per&s;on who had introduced the conver&s;ation, and had al&s;o in|terfered by taking hold on the Valet's arm, when he was going to &s;tab the Groom; I could not but &s;uppo&s;e that by my friend and his family being &s;afe, that I was the devoted per&s;on. However, as after a recapitulation of the whole conver&s;ation, and of what pa&s;&s;ed during our in|terference to part the Groom and Valet, we could not fix upon any thing whereby I could po&s;&s;ibly have given any particular offence to the Valet, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be tolerably well paci|fied. I &s;taid with my friend &s;ix nights after the Groom had been arre&s;ted, and then returned home, about three leagues from Paris, where I did not arrive 'till it was dark.</P>
<P>On knocking at my door, it was opened to me as u&s;ual by my &s;ervant: to whom I &s;aid, "Well Jacques, is all the family well?" the &s;ervant gave me no an&s;wer: it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to conceive the horror that came over me: however, I walked into the room, where I &s;aw the u&s;ual preparations made for &s;upper, and where were &s;itting my wife and daughter, a girl of nine years of age, bathed in tears, unable, and afraid to &s;peak a &s;ingle word. Whil&s;t I was en|deavouring to unravel this my&s;tery, I was &s;alu|ted by a touch on the &s;houlder from the Valet of my friend, and the &s;ame officer of Police that had taken up the Groom at my friend's hou&s;e, a few nights before; but the guard of &s;oldiers was much &s;tronger.</P>
<P>Behold reader, a wretched man for no crime
<PB N="8" REF="030151_0007_0FE4AE2BB5811520">
whatever reduced from the &s;ummit of happine&s;s, to the depth of mi&s;ery: his e&s;tate confi&s;cated, his family reduced to beggary, him&s;elf &s;hut up for life, and that perhaps unfortunately a long life, in an unwhole&s;ome dungeon.</P>
<P>Cur&s;ed be that government, which founded on iniquity, and in con&s;equence thereof, view|ing every thing with a coward and &s;u&s;picious eye, devotes with unfeeling indifferance the probable and po&s;itive offender. But doubly cur|&s;ed be that government, which, not content with pretext of e&s;tabli&s;hing it's &s;ecurity on the mi&s;ery of it's &s;ubjects, meanly calls in avarice to it's aid, in order to &s;trip the innocent relations of the accu&s;ed, of their undoubted right, their daily bread.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t learnt however, that my unfortu|nate family did not long &s;urvive &s;o hard a fate: my poor wife, (for tho' &s;he has been dead many years, has to me been dead &s;carcely &s;o many days, I having heard of her death but &s;ince my e&s;cape from the Ba&s;tile) died within ten days af|ter my commitment, raving mad, and &s;tarved to death: for it would have been death, in&s;tant death, to any per&s;on whatever to have relieved her. My poor infant daughter was to have been con&s;igned over to a harder fate, but heaven for|bad it: on the repre&s;entation of the officer of the Police to the Marquis de &mdash;, a notorious and famous catamite of the court of Lewis the Fifteenth; &s;he was by him &s;ent for, and orders were given for her being elegantly brought up, 'till &s;he was of proper age to become &s;ub&s;ervient to his abominable purpo&s;es. But, heaven be
<PB N="9" REF="030151_0008_0FE4AE2D41D67D50">
prai&s;ed, &s;he paid the debt of nature, as I am ju&s;t informed within &s;ix months after &s;he had fallen into the Marquis de &mdash;'s hands.</P>
<P>Form to your&s;elf, reader, the idea of a govern|ment, under which the &s;ubject offers up thanks to Almighty God for depriving him of his dear|e&s;t connections, his wife and family, and think him&s;elf happy in the lo&s;s of them! Such was France.</P>
<P>More than twenty years ago I was forever parted from my wife and only child, and con|ducted, or rather dragged, in a wretched clo&s;e cart, from my own hou&s;e to the Ba&s;tile, under a guard of near one hundred &s;oldiers: every room in my hou&s;e was filled with armed men, except that in which were &s;itting my wife and daughter. The &s;alute given me on the &s;houlder by the valet and officer of the Police was the &s;ignal for their coming out. The Intendant of the Police had given &s;trict orders that none of my family &s;hould be permitted to &s;peak, or to leave the hou&s;e on pain of death, a threat which would undoubted|ly have been in&s;tantly put in execution.</P>
<P>My two maid &s;ervants, who, on my arrival were ordered into a private room, had been treated by the &s;oldiers in a manner too &s;hocking, and too indecent to be committed to paper. The&s;e wretched executors of, what they call, ju&s;tice, had been waiting two nights in my hou&s;e expecting my arrival: and the rea&s;on why I was not apprehended at my friend's hou&s;e, I am told, was, that the valet laid his information again&s;t me on the Intendant of Police giving his
<PB N="10" REF="030151_0009_0FE4AE3607D62638">
word and honour that I &s;hould not be taken dur|ing my vi&s;it there. One of my maid &s;ervants died in a few days, in con&s;equence of the brutal treatment &s;he had received from the&s;e officers of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> of the footman, and other unhappy fe|male &s;ervant, no account, I am told, could ever be given: it would have been certain death to have a&s;ked a &s;ingle que&s;tion about them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived at the Ba&s;tile, at a &s;ignal given, which I never could di&s;cover, but which I rather think was made by dropping the Lettre de Cachet through a niche, I was received by an officer of the Ba&s;tile, who&s;e feelings &s;eemed to be as brutal as the odious Police of which he was an executioner. The Lettre de Cachet, which, as he had it in his hand, he mu&s;t, as I &s;aid before, have received through a niche, was, together with me, delivered to the Governor of the Ba&s;tile, as great a brute in di&s;po&s;ition, but of more ex|ternal poli&s;h, than the former. This murderer, for no le&s;s can I call him, did not do me the &s;ame honour, which, on peril of his life, he was obliged to do the Lettre de Cachet; for that he was compelled to receive with his own hands, but me he made over to the Deputy Governor, by whom I was con&s;igned to the common Turn|key, who pu&s;hed me in the dark into my cell. This Deputy Governor was much &s;uch a fellow as a good painter would have made of the Police of France had he per&s;onified it: that is, the meanne&s;s and cruelty of popery triumphing over an innocent and helple&s;s individual. A religion made up of glo&s;s, hypocri&s;y, and prie&s;t-craft: pretending to pardon offences committed again&s;t Omnipotence, and actually torturing for a re|mark
<PB N="11" REF="030151_0010_0FE4AE3791D56A18">
made on the vile pro&s;titute of a profligate monarch: forgiving, for a pitiful pittance, crimes again&s;t nature and again&s;t humanity: de|barring the Almighty of the adoration due to him as God Supreme, and conferring it upon Saints, many of them as profligate and ob&s;cure as their adorers.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock in the morning on the next day, a na&s;ty, &s;qualid, cadaverous, figure, who, any where, but in France, would have been taken for the figure of Famine, brought me a blanket, &s;ome clean &s;traw, a quart of &s;tink|ing water, and about four ounces of mo&s;t execra|ble bread. As my appetite was not very good, the bread, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, remained un|touched. The water I &s;eized with the greate&s;t avidity, and filthy as it was, drank it off at one draught. At two in the afternoon, the &s;ame quantity of bread and water was again brought me by the &s;ame meagre figure, who, ob&s;erving that the bread which he had brought me in the morning, remained untouched, took back with him what he then brought me. At eight o'clock in the evening he came again, bringing the &s;ame quantity of bread and water; but ob&s;erving, as at two o'clock, that the bread he had brought me remained untouched, he again took, what he brought at eight o'clock, away with him.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I had formed the dreadful re&s;olution of &s;tarving my&s;elf to death: a re&s;olu|tion which my <HI>generous</HI> keepers &s;eemed them&s;elves ready to meet me at lea&s;t half way in. This however, even with their powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I was unable to put into execution. Had I been
<PB N="12" REF="030151_0011_0FE4AE391A128F80">
furni&s;hed with any po&s;&s;ible means of putting my|&s;elf to death by an act of &s;udden violence, I un|doubtedly &s;hould have done it. Such means, however, were effectually denied me. For, previous to my being pu&s;hed into this mi&s;erable apartment, I was &s;tripped of my &s;hirt, neck-cloth, garters, &s;tockings, handkerchief, &s;hoe, and knee buckles: in lieu of which I was pre|&s;ented with a flannel &s;hirt, and a pair of wretch|ed flannel &s;tockings: &s;uch was my dre&s;s, and by no means too often renewed, during my whole impri&s;onment: &s;uch too, as above &s;et forth, was my food.</P>
<P>The chamber, if it de&s;erves that name, in which I was confined, was up one pair of &s;tairs. The only furniture of which was an earthen pot, and a &s;tone of about half a ton weight which &s;erved me for a &s;eat; the room was about twelve feet high, and about a foot from the cieling was a window about fourteen inches &s;quare, but &s;o barricadoed with iron bars, that it would have been utterly impo&s;&s;ible even for a &s;parrow to have pa&s;&s;ed between them. In con&s;equence of the breadth of the room from the wall to the window, which was &s;carcely five feet, I had no po&s;&s;ible chance of &s;eeing even the &s;ky; more than that I could not expect to &s;ee through the &s;canty crevi|&s;es of the iron bars: to have reached the window would have been utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and as it could have an&s;wered no po&s;&s;ible end whatever, but to have created a zealou&s;y in my brutal keep|ers, &s;o did I never once think of attempting it. The length of the room was about eighteen feet: the gloomine&s;s, and melancholy of it dreadful to a degree: dreadful from the &s;ad reflection of
<PB N="13" REF="030151_0012_0FE4AE3B94E10438">
it having been the tomb of many a living corp&s;e, devoted like me to the zealou&s;y of a cruel and ty|rannical government, and more dreadful to me as being the then unhappy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it.</P>
<P>The cieling of this accur&s;ed appartment con|&s;i&s;ted of iron bars, nearly as thick as my wri&s;t, and within a quarter of an inch of each other cro&s;s wi&s;e. This, for the two or three fir&s;t months of my impri&s;onment, I own appeared unaccountable to me, as the floor was of deal.</P>
<P>What will not the love of liberty do? and with what improbable and even impo&s;&s;ible hopes will it not furni&s;h us? from this con&s;ideration, namely of the floor being compo&s;ed of deal, I flattered my&s;elf that one day or other I might be able to effect my e&s;cape: and my hope of doing it was the rather flattered, as I had ob&s;erved that one of the boards was loo&s;e, nearly the whole length of the cell: and I had taken it up, not from any idea of then putting my project into execution, but of getting the thing as it were in train: in a moment I heard the turnkey at the door, and though it took him &s;ome time to open it, yet was I, unable, from &s;urprize, to replace the board, or even to lay it out of my hands, &s;o great was my con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>The turnkey, on &s;eeing my awkward &s;ituation, immediately locked the door again, and in le&s;s than five minutes returned with four men whom I had never before &s;een, bringing with them a lanthorn. He was locked with me into my cell, and &s;etting his lanthorn upon the &s;tone, which I before &s;aid was in my cell, very deliberately took
<PB N="14" REF="030151_0013_0FE4AE41662EFE70">
up almo&s;t every board before my face, and &s;hew|ed me, what, 'till then, I never could have &s;u&s;|pected to have been the ca&s;e, a floor con&s;i&s;ting of iron plates at lea&s;t half an inch thick: having replaced the boards, he gave a rap at the door, in con&s;equence of which it was immediately opened, and he took his leave of me, with the mo&s;t contemptuous &s;neer in his countenance that in&s;olence could &s;ugge&s;t: here ended my hopes of an e&s;cape. I was not however, as I expected, put in irons, but was treated by my keeper with exce&s;&s;ive contempt, and &s;ilent allu&s;ions to my project of forming an e&s;cape. During the whole of the ceremony of the turnkey removing the boards, not a &s;yllable pa&s;&s;ed between us: as he had po&s;itive orders no doubt never to utter a &s;yl|lable, &s;o I, through fear of ill-treatment, and, at the &s;ame time, con&s;idering it as u&s;ele&s;s, never once opened my lips.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that on my fir&s;t commitment to that pri&s;on, the di&s;grace of a chri&s;tian country, and the horror of France, I expected every day, or rather every hour, to be put to the torture: this however was not the ca&s;e: my body was no farther put to the rack, than as it partook of the, &s;ufferings of my mind: let the humane reader form to him&s;elf the idea of being, to a certainty, confined during life, in &s;uch a chamber as I have de&s;cribed, debarred of bodily exerci&s;e, of the lib|erty of breathing a free or whole&s;ome air, of the enjoyment of &s;uch amu&s;ements as the mind of a rational being, tired of idlene&s;s and inactivity naturally has recour&s;e to, and from which it as naturally finds relief, let him form to him&s;elf, I &s;ay this id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">, and let him refrain, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="15" REF="030151_0014_0FE4AE43EBD004C8">
from the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible emotions, in behalf of the unfortunate pri&s;oners. A reflection this, that mu&s;t operate powerfully upon the feelings of any one but of an intendant of French Police, or of his ba&s;e and infamous, but now degraded, employers.</P>
<P>To the horror of the above &s;cene, may be ad|ded the terrible apprehen&s;ion the pri&s;oner is hourly under, of being put to the torture: of this, no notice whatever is given him: he lit|terally has no a&s;&s;urance whatever of not being taken out of his &s;leep and torn to pieces by the cruelty of the officers of the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The la&s;t human being to whom I &s;poke for more than twenty years, to the day of my re|lea&s;e (I relate it with pity to my&s;elf, and with &s;hame for my country) were my unfortunate wife and daughter: and from the&s;e, the friends of my bo&s;om, I was not &s;uffered to receive any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, in the account of my impri&s;onment, not wi&s;hing my&s;elf to reflect upon a &s;ubject, on which I can|not reflect, but with the greate&s;t horror and which having no variety in it&s;elf, cannot but be very unentertaining to the reader.</P>
<P>Suffice it therefore to &s;ay: that I was kept in the &s;ame room continually: and never once, during &s;o many years impri&s;onment was &s;uffered to pa&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> the thre&s;hold: my whole and only food was bread and water, both bad, and very bad, in it's kind. I never &s;poke to, or was ever
<PB N="16" REF="030151_0015_0FE4AE457615EAB0">
once &s;poken to, by any human creature whatever. The only variety that I ever experienced, was in re&s;pect of heat and cold, and for this I was indebted to the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>During the five or &s;ix la&s;t winters, the cold was mo&s;t dreadfully puni&s;hing: I made a &s;ign to the Turnkey to have an additional blanket, and &s;tockings, but of this he took not the lea&s;t notice. In &s;ummer the air was foetid, and &s;uf|focating, and frequently to &s;uch a degree, that the very Turnkey him&s;elf who was a walking dunghill, was utterly unable to face the noi&s;ome effluvia on opening the door of my cell. Such, reader, was the variety I &s;peak of, but I &s;hall pa&s;s on to that glorious day in which I recovered my liberty.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the morning I heard, what I had never before heard during my whole infamous impri&s;onment, a variety of voices un|der my window, and pre&s;ently, the cry of "to arms." As I concluded that it was nothing more than &s;ome poor helple&s;s individual who either had, or who was then attempting to make his e&s;cape, after wi&s;hing him every po&s;&s;ible &s;uc|ce&s;s, and having called down every po&s;&s;ible cur&s;e on the Police of France, I again fell a&s;leep. The noi&s;e however did not end here: I then concluded that &s;ome of the pri&s;oners had actual|ly ri&s;en again&s;t their keepers, and on hearing the firing of a mu&s;quet was more than ever confir|med in my opinion, that this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e. But as I well knew that, even had it been the ca&s;e, the conte&s;t mu&s;t terminate in favour of the officers of the Ba&s;tile, I again laid my&s;elf down indifferent about the con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030151_0016_0FE4AE47F3880FF8">In le&s;s than an hour I heard a much greater uproar, and a &s;hout of <HI>"Vive la liberte,"</HI> Lib|erty for ever. This exclamation thought I, can never proceed from the mouths of the officers of the Ba&s;tile. Nor, indeed, did it: but from the mouths of tho&s;e forty brave in&s;urgents who were but a &s;mall part of the a&s;&s;ertors of the glo|rious emancipation of France.</P>
<P>The&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons were admitted within the walls of the Ba&s;tile, on pretext of making terms of &s;urrender between the Gover|nor and the populace. But, &s;uch was the faith of a French government, &s;carcely were they en|tered within the walls of that grave of Liberty, when they were &s;et upon by a well armed, though not numerous, Military, which is al|ways kept in the Ba&s;tile, and in&s;tantly, contra|ry to the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e on part of the of|ficers of the Ba&s;tile, put to death by fire and &s;word. Dreadful Triumph! and &s;ucceeded by a &s;hout very different from that of <HI>"Vive la lib|erte"</HI> that of <HI>"Vive la Police"</HI> or &s;lavery for ever.</P>
<P>It will not be here improper to ob&s;erve, that the Military, and every officer of the Ba&s;tile, except the Governor, is, in fact, as much a pri&s;oner, as any pri&s;oner there, except that he has the whole range of the premi&s;es of the pri&s;on to walk in. When he enters upon his office he takes it for life, and he would in&s;tantly be put to the torture, and then to death, were he to be &s;een, or even to expre&s;s a wi&s;h to be without the walls of the pri&s;on: nor can the Governor him|&s;elf be ab&s;ent more than ten nights together, and
<PB N="18" REF="030151_0017_0FE4AE4F51E75BD8">
that only by permi&s;&s;ion of the King, and with his &s;ign manuel. A plain proof this, that the Police is thoroughly a&s;hamed of the cruelty and inju&s;tice which it is continually guilty of.</P>
<P>But to proceed:</P>
<P>I now heard &s;ilence demanded, and procla|mation made (by order of the Governor as I was afterwards informed) to quarter the bodies of the unfortunate per&s;ons, who had &s;o nobly on their part, and &s;o di&s;gracefully on the part of the Governor and officers or the Ba&s;tile, lo&s;t their lives in defence of liberty; and to throw their limbs over the battlements to the terror of their companions, in order to &s;hew them what they were to expect, as a cha&s;ti&s;ement of their rebellion, if they did not immediately di&s;per&s;e.</P>
<P>This however was not put in execution: the barbarians contented them&s;elves with hanging the dead bodies on the pali&s;adoes, and expo&s;ing them in a manner the mo&s;t brutal and ignomini|ous, and in &s;uch a manner as would have di&s;|graced an inqui&s;ition, or any thing but a French Police.</P>
<P>By this act of brutality, the number of the in|&s;urgents, and their fury, was increa&s;ed at lea&s;t fifty fold. And matters were now come to &s;uch a pitch, that nothing but a &s;urrender could po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ave the lives of the per&s;ons in the Ba&s;tile. This being evident to the Governor, he called all the officers of the pri&s;on together, and pro|po&s;ed (for I heard him with my own ears) to put every pri&s;oner to death, and to bury their bodies,
<PB N="19" REF="030151_0018_0FE4AE50DB62D188">
in order that nothing relative to that place of confinement, might tran&s;pire.</P>
<P>Reader, if thou ha&s;t any feeling for my unhap|py &s;ituation, exert it for me here: if thou ha&s;t one tear, drop it for me here. My very heart bleeds at the bare recollection of the dreadful propo&s;al.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation among&s;t the officers of the Ba&s;tile, the Governor was &s;ummoned to the wall to know whether he would &s;urrender. He would &s;urrender, he &s;aid, if they would &s;wear to him to &s;pare his life, This however was even &s;o far from being promi&s;ed to him, that he was, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive and &s;olemn manner a&s;&s;ured, that, in con&s;equence of his cruelty and breach of &s;aith towards their companions, he &s;hould infallibly be put to death within three hours after his &s;urrender: that if he deferred his &s;urrender ten minutes, he &s;hould be put to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture. This, however, was &s;o far from prevailing upon him to &s;et open the gates, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give up the pri&s;on, and came down from the battlements.</P>
<P>Upon this, the fellow who had the manage|ment of the draw-bridge, and who al&s;o had the keys of the gate of the pri&s;on, and who (as I af|terwards learnt) was more than fifty yards from the Governor, hearing this re&s;olution of the Governor, let fall as if by accident, the draw|bridge, and offered immediately to open the gate on condition that they would &s;pare his life.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was made and executed in half
<PB N="20" REF="030151_0019_0FE4AE5263B92FF8">
a minute, and the in&s;urgents were put in com|plete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;on. The military within the Ba&s;tile were &s;ummoned to lay down their arms, which demand they immediately complied with. The greate&s;t &s;ilence and order was ob&s;erved. The Governor was called for, and ordered to go down upon his knees, and to an&s;wer aloud to every que&s;tion.</P>

<P>The Governor was then ordered to follow, and to direct his officers to open every cell. O Heavens! What a &s;cene!

<P>Many of the&s;e poor wretches were &s;o emacia|ted as to be unable to &s;tand: &s;ome of them came forth frantic with joy; others, from the &s;en&s;e of their dreadful &s;ufferings, and of what they had, in all probability, yet to &s;uffer for many a tedious year, had lap&s;ed into a &s;tate of idiotcy; and one poor man, in particular, was obliged to be lifted out, being unable to &s;tand upon his legs, in con&s;equence of having had his knees and ancle bones di&s;located by the torture. This unfortunate pri&s;oner had been there upwards of &s;even years, and had been tortured once every year.</P>
<P>As many of the pri&s;oners as were capable of bearing arms had the arms and cloaths of &s;uch &s;oldiers as were in the Ba&s;tile given to them; and, in return, the &s;oldiers them&s;elves were cloathed in the rags of the pri&s;oners, and in that condition turned out of the pri&s;on gates.</P>

<P>The gentleman came back in about a quarter of an hour, and &s;aid briefly, that he had been eye-witne&s;s to a &s;cene too &s;hocking to be looked upon: he then ordered the implements of tor|ture to be brought out, and to be de&s;troyed by the officers of the Ba&s;tile them&s;elves. After which the Governor was ordered to prepare to die within one hour, and was accordingly per|mitted to be clo&s;&s;eted with the Confe&s;&s;or of the
<PB N="24" REF="030151_0023_0FE3F814DF537478">
Ba&s;tile. At the expiration of the hour he was brought out, and hanged over the battlements in the &s;ight of, at lea&s;t, a hundred thou&s;and populace, of whom the Giant of this Enchanted Ca&s;tle had long been the terror and dread.</P>
<P>The &s;hout was univer&s;al: it a&s;cended to God's throne an offering of a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour. A mo&s;t grateful offering to the Father of Ju&s;tice and Mercy!</P>
<P>And now (having &s;een by glorious experiment that the Lord of this ca&s;tle of terror was vulnera|ble) it was determined to try whether the walls of the pri&s;on were not as liable to mortality. In three days the whole pri&s;on was razed to the ground. What became of the other officers of the Ba&s;tile it is difficult to &s;ay; &s;ome of them, on being turned out of the pri&s;on gates, were in&s;tantly torn to pieces by the populace, not, however, before they had been made to take down the bodies of the men, who had, under truce, entered the pri&s;on, and who&s;e bodies, after they had been mo&s;t &s;hamefully murdered, had been hung on the pali&s;adoes, and buried them in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner.</P>
<P>Having given a very faithful and accurate ac|count of the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this fortre&s;s, (if &s;uch I may call it) which, 'till this day, was thought impregnable, I &s;hall proceed to &s;et be|fore the reader, the manner in which the de&s;|truction of it was carried on.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all Proclamation was made preci&s;ely in the following words.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="030151_0024_0FE4AE5EEC0E1380"><Q>In the name of Almighty God, the Father of Mercies, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit, be perfect Love and Liberty to this and every Nation under Heaven for evermore: Amen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereas this odious pri&s;on called the Ba&s;|tile has, in particular, for many years, exi&s;ted the terror and di&s;grace of Religion and Lib|erty, the di&s;grace of former reigns, and of the faithful and good &s;ubjects of his pre&s;ent mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty Lewis the Sixteenth, and of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Queen, whom God pre&s;erve; we, the Nation, do hereby condemn to utter annihilation, and perdition, the &s;aid odious pri&s;on, as being highly di&s;graceful to us as men, and to our country as chri&s;tians, and highly reflecting upon our allegiance to our mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King: determining here|by to bani&s;h tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, the influ|ence of wicked Mini&s;ters, and the damnable power of the Church of Rome, Amen.</Q></P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the proclamation made, than the demolition of the building was begun, and in the mo&s;t workman-like and methodical man|ner. The lead of the roof was fir&s;t of all &s;trip|ped off and thrown down upon the ground, and was then, as were all the other parts of the Ba&s;|tile, as fa&s;t as they were pulled down, thrown into the ditch which &s;urrounded it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the lead was &s;tripped off, there ap|peared a roof of iron plates half an inch thick, &s;crew'd down to iron bars of four inches diame|ter. So that it would have been utterly impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="26" REF="030151_0025_0FE4AE60754CF560">
for any pri&s;oner whatever to have got through the roof. This, indeed, the &s;crews being put in from without &s;ide would have prevented, as would al&s;o the height of the rooms: tho&s;e of the upper &s;tory being three or four feet higher than tho&s;e on the lower &s;tories: when the&s;e iron plates, and the bars to which they were &s;crew'd, were removed, an arched roof of &s;tone pre&s;ented it&s;elf, built in the form of an oven: under this arch, which was much more difficult to be brok|en through than the iron roof, it was pre&s;umed that the cells would appear; but this was by no means the ca&s;e; there was yet another ceiling of large iron bars laid cro&s;s-wi&s;e, &s;crewed togeth|er very forcibly, and under that a ceiling of boards. In each of the upper cells was a &s;et of iron rings and chains fa&s;tened to the floor, to which a pri&s;oner was to be chained in ca&s;e he at|tempted an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The roof of the pri&s;on being completely taken off, the walls were next pulled down to the bot|tom of the uppermo&s;t &s;et of cells, the floors of the&s;e cells had nothing peculiar in them: their &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in the iron ceiling of the cells below them: which were of plates of iron rivet|ed, in&s;tead of &s;crewed to very large and clo&s;e laid iron bars: nor was it po&s;&s;ible to have remo|ved them but by taking the weight of the &s;ide walls off the ends of them: by this method the matter was effected with tolerable ca&s;e. And now, night coming on, it was agreed to &s;u&s;pend the work by common con&s;ent. And every key belonging to the Ba&s;tile, together with the outer gates of it having been buried in the ditch, un|der &s;ome thou&s;and loads of rubbi&s;h, and the cells
<PB N="27" REF="030151_0026_0FE4AE688A745888">
being open, as many as could get lodging in the pri&s;on did &s;o; many returned home 'till the morning, and many thou&s;ands remained abroad the whole night: for my own part, I took up with my old apartment, though with this differ|ence, that in&s;tead of &s;olitude I had company enough, and in&s;tead of &s;pending the night as a mi&s;erable captive, I &s;pent it with as much plea|&s;ure, or I hope with more, than if I had been Governor of the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>The next morning, by break of day, the de|molition of the pri&s;on proceeded as regularly and in as &s;pirited a manner as on the day before: and although the wall was much thicker, the nearer we came to the ground, yet was it lower|ed with con&s;iderable more ea&s;e than nearer the top of the building, on account of there being le&s;s lead and iron work among&s;t the &s;tones.</P>
<P>Every hour, or le&s;s, fre&s;h per&s;ons were em|ployed, as well to throw down the wall, as al&s;o to remove the materials into the ditch: and &s;o great was the number of people, and &s;uch their eagerne&s;s to &s;upply the places of tho&s;e who had been at work, that had the pri&s;on been ten times as large, it would have been taken down in as &s;hort a time: during the whole of this, as al&s;o on the preceding day, there was no ce&s;&s;ation of labour whatever, and by the time that it was too dark to carry on the work on the &s;econd even|ing, the pri&s;on was taken down to the &s;urface of the earth. Whil&s;t one part of the populace was at work on the Ba&s;tile and Governor's hou&s;e another part was at work on the wall that &s;ur|rounded the pri&s;on, which was thrown into the
<PB N="28" REF="030151_0027_0FE4AE6A1340F480">
ditch by the fir&s;t night. The draw-bridge al&s;o was thrown into the ditch and buried under the rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>When it was dark, the people retired as on the former night, and the mo&s;t &s;trict order and decorum were ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t doubtle&s;s appear &s;urpri&s;ing that it never once occurred to any per&s;on pre&s;ent to ex|amine the apartments under ground: nor, 'till the pri&s;on was pulled down to the &s;urface, were the&s;e &s;ubterraneous cells I believe once thought of:</P>
<P>As the doors of the&s;e chambers of death, if I may &s;o call them, had not been opened, and as the keys of them, as well as every key belonging to the Ba&s;tile had, as has been &s;aid, been buried under &s;ome thou&s;and loads of rubbi&s;h, it was now impo&s;&s;ible to open them. Nothing remain|ed therefore but to come at them by taking off their ceilings. It was &s;u&s;pected that there might be many unfortunate pri&s;oners confined in the&s;e noi&s;ome and dreadful abodes, which, was it the ca&s;e they mu&s;t be at lea&s;t forty eight hours with|out victuals or drink before they could be reliev|ed. In con&s;equence of the&s;e reflexions, to per|&s;ons eagerly wi&s;hing to re&s;tore their fellow crea|tures to the joyful face of day, and to the common rights of humanity, and &s;en&s;ible at the &s;ame time what they mu&s;t then &s;uffer from hun|ger and thir&s;t, and &s;till had to &s;uffer before they could po&s;&s;ibly be relieved, the approach of the morning, was expected, not only with the ut|mo&s;t, but even with the mo&s;t painful impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030151_0028_0FE4AE6B9AC856A8">By nine o'clock in the morning of the third day, the ceilings over the&s;e &s;ubterraneous cells, which were preci&s;ely the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the &s;ett of cells above them, were intirely removed: and in the&s;e cells, to our infinite &s;atisfaction, and utter a&s;toni&s;hment, not a &s;ingle pri&s;oner was found.</P>
<P>The&s;e cells were in all re&s;pects like tho&s;e above them, except that they had no window in them: in&s;tead of which there was a little wretched light let in through the doors: and in order to prevent any unhappy per&s;on who might be the tenant of them, from a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing any thing, a hole was cut in the left hand &s;ide of the door next the cell, and in the right hand &s;ide of the outermo&s;t door.</P>
<P>Having already given a very accurate account of the windows of the cells, I now proceed to a de&s;cription of the doors of them. To each cell there were three doors, all of them of prodigious &s;trength, one of which are opened outwardly to|ward the goaler; this door, although of wood, might with much greater propriety be &s;aid to be of iron, being &s;tudded with nails with mon|&s;trous heads, &s;o as almo&s;t to met each other, and to form, within a very little, a &s;uperficies of iron: they were al&s;o covered tran&s;ver&s;ely with iron bars, &s;crewed on with the heads of the &s;crews al|ternately placed, one to the out&s;ide of the cell, and one to the in&s;ide of it: between every two &s;crews was a very &s;trong rivet of iron: this door was locked by a prodigious double lock of pecu|liar &s;trength and con&s;truction, and al&s;o with a padlock: this being done, a grated door wholly
<PB N="30" REF="030151_0029_0FE4AE6D2395E0E8">
of iron was pulled down like a &s;a&s;h, between this and the outermo&s;t door. The iron bars, of which this &s;a&s;h was compo&s;ed, were &s;olid, mea|&s;uring two inches on every &s;ide: it's inter&s;tices were about four inches wide. This door lock|ed on the &s;ide into the wall in all re&s;pects like another door, and was al&s;o locked by a &s;taple, of prodigious &s;trength, to the ground. This gra&s;e or door being made fa&s;t, the outermo&s;t door was locked preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner as the door next the pri&s;oner: three no bad &s;ecurities the&s;e again&s;t a poor helple&s;s individual: nor indeed again&s;t the good wi&s;hes of &s;uch of his friends as might have any idea of conferring upon him his liberty.</P>
<P>A principal rea&s;on why the pri&s;oners in France (I mean what are called &s;tate pri&s;oners) are kept with &s;o zealous an eye is, becau&s;e gov|ernment having generally impri&s;oned them for nothing, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es having u&s;ed the tor|ture, it is a&s;hamed and afraid to relea&s;e them le&s;t they &s;hould tell their hi&s;tory to the di&s;advan|tage of the &s;tate. So the mini&s;ter was afraid to relea&s;e La Tude, le&s;t he &s;hould write his me|moirs: La Tude &mdash;, did write his me|moires: and they will ever remain a di&s;grace to the la&s;t and pre&s;ent reigns of France.</P>
<P>But to proceed:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was perceived that no pri&s;oner whatever was confined in the&s;e &s;ubterraneous cells, it was determined to dig at the bottom of each of them, in order to examine whether there were any rooms under them: to be fully &s;atis|fied
<PB N="31" REF="030151_0030_0FE4AE7551CEC2F8">
of this, four feet depth of earth was taken out of each cell: but no &s;igns of other rooms ap|pearing, the great &s;tones, which compo&s;ed the foundation of the pri&s;on, and which made al&s;o the &s;ide walls of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous cells, were thrown down into the holes, from which the four foot of earth had been taken, and the earth, which had been dug out, &s;erved to cover the place where the infamous Ba&s;tile had &s;o long, and &s;o lately &s;tood: a &s;pot now capable of a bet|ter harve&s;t, hitherto fruitful only in cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ighs and tears of the wretch|ed pri&s;oner and captive.</P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that I am not giving a de&s;cription of the Ba&s;tile, no one can be more improper to undertake a ta&s;k of that &s;ort than a per&s;on who was carried in by night, and thru&s;t into a mi&s;erable dark cell, in which he was kept upwards of twenty years a clo&s;e pri|&s;oner. By the time that I was let out of my cell, the pri&s;on was &s;o full of the populace that I could get no competent view of the premi&s;es of it, nor indeed did I ever think of doing it: whatever the premi&s;es or gardens of it were, they were de&s;troyed, together with the buildings, be|fore I ever thought of examining them. All I &s;hall &s;peak of therefore will be what came imme|diately under my eye.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the pri&s;on it&s;elf, there were two other buildings, both of them exceedingly low, with|in the walls of this gloomy man&s;ion: namely the hou&s;e of the Governor and deputy Governor, both of them under the &s;ame roof; and a hou&s;e for the common turnkeys. The former, as
<PB N="32" REF="030151_0031_0FE4AE76DA585E98">
having nothing peculiar belonging to it, need no de&s;cription. Of the latter I &s;hall &s;ay but lit|tle. At the door of this hou&s;e for the common turnkeys, there u&s;ed to &s;tand, night and day, a centinal, into who&s;e box came a bell rope, which, when pulled, rang a bell in every room of the hou&s;e at the &s;ame time, in which the common goalers lived. This was regularly rang three times a day when the goalers went to feed the unhappy pri&s;oners: and in ca&s;e of any alarm; but never el&s;e upon any occa&s;ion whatever.</P>
<P>If the goalers vi&s;ited the cells, or any partic|ular cell, at any other, than at the &s;tated hours, it was always done (truely charactere&s;tic of a French Police) without giving this notice. No turn-key dared to vi&s;it a cell on any pretence whatever, at any other than the &s;tated hours on pain of in&s;tant death, without an order from the Governor, or, in his ab&s;ence, from the Deputy Governor, which order was always given in per|&s;on by word of mouth.</P>
<P>The military, I have been informed, never interfered with the pri&s;oners, nor with the goa|lers; nor were they allowed to a&s;&s;ociate with them, or even to conver&s;e with them. They lived in barracks built again&s;t the wall of the Ba&s;tile, which &s;urrounded the ditch; they were under the command of the Governor, though a Sergeant was always their o&s;ten&s;ible comman|der.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e in which the goalers lived, was circular; in one part of it was a large room in which they eat, drank, and a&s;&s;ociated, during
<PB N="33" REF="030151_0032_0FE4AE7866D208B8">
the day time: all around this room were other chambers in which they &s;lept, and in which, as I before &s;aid, a bell was hung, as there was al|&s;o in the common room. Under this hou&s;e was a very &s;pacious vault, which we took for a chan|nel hou&s;e, but on opening it, it proved to be nothing more than a place in which they kept victuals, and it had in it &s;everal ve&s;&s;els of weak wine.</P>
<P>This vault received its light and air from half a dozen &s;mall windows, which were &s;ecured by a few &s;light iron bars; but, within it was a door, or rather three doors, made preci&s;ely like the doors of the cells in which the pri&s;oners were kept. To break the&s;e open in any rea&s;onable time was utterly impo&s;&s;ible, it was therefore re|&s;olved upon to remove them by taking away the &s;tone work on the &s;ide of the po&s;ts; this was, at la&s;t, effected with infinite la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> and difficul|ty: the &s;taple to which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, or &s;a&s;h door was fa&s;tened to the ground, gave us incredible trouble; it was however determined to open it, and opened it was.</P>
<P>The conjectures of what might be the con|tents of this &s;trongly fortified chamber, were numerous, and, as it afterwards proved, all of them erroneous. One conjectured that it mu&s;t be a room &s;et apart for torture; another, that it was a vault for burying the dead, or a charnel hou&s;e; others, a mine, in ca&s;e of a&s;&s;ault: how|ever, it turned out to be a very large and &s;pacious room full of arms of different &s;orts, antient and modern, and had in it al&s;o &s;ome gunpowder and ball. The windows of it, which were four
<PB N="34" REF="030151_0033_0FE4AE7AE8C54950">
only, were very &s;trongly fortified and glazed; they looked out through the wall that &s;urround|ed the Ba&s;tile, into the great ditch, and were &s;o formed as not to be very vi&s;ible on the out&s;ide. Such of the arms as were found in this room, and which were of u&s;e, were put into the hands of the in&s;urgents: the old guns which fired with a match, were left behind, and buried in the ruins, as being wholly u&s;ele&s;s. The arch which covered this room, (for it ran from under the hou&s;e in which the common goalers lived, to the out&s;ide of the wall of the Ba&s;tile) was dug through, and the room, together with the Ba&s;tile, its gates, walls, Governor's hou&s;e, and, in &s;hort, the whole premi&s;es belonging to it, were razed, not only to the ground, but two feet, at lea&s;t, beneath the ground: and no trace of the &s;pot, on which it &s;tood, left behind.</P>
<P>This being done, proclamation was made for &s;ilence: and the herald was ordered to return thanks to Almighty God, for this &s;ingular nation|al delivery, from a tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive government: and a cur&s;e was denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould rebuild, or attempt, or propo&s;e, or wi&s;h to rebuild this pri&s;on. The whole was concluded with three acclamations of "Vive le Roi," "Vive la Liberte" "Vive la Nation."</P>
<P>I cannot my&s;elf (I may perhaps be &s;ingular in my opinion) forbear thinking but that the French Court has &s;uffered, in it's turn, for the many acts of cruelty and perfidy it has been re|peatedly guilty of towards a part of it's &s;ubjects, which, on all occa&s;ions, has lived in the mo&s;t or|derly manner under that cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive government. I mean the Prote&s;tants:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030151_0034_0FE4AE8098960588">Thus have I done, what I propo&s;ed, laid be|fore the public in the be&s;t manner I am able, a full, clear, and accurate account of the de&s;truc|tion of this once infamous pri&s;on, the terror alike of the wicked and good: the Grave of Liberty, the &s;candal of France, the di&s;grace of Europe: It was my mo&s;t determined re&s;olution not to quit that odious and dete&s;table &s;pot &s;o long as one &s;tone was left &s;tanding upon another: It was my re&s;olution I &s;ay, and I adhered to it mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly.</P>

<P>THE Ba&s;tille, in its original form, &s;tood at the entrance of Paris, on the &s;ide of the Fauxbourg Saint Antoine:&mdash;It then con&s;i&s;ted but of two towers. The de&s;ign of the Ca&s;tle was given, and the fir&s;t &s;tone laid April 23, 1369, by Hugh Aubriot, Prevo&s;t of Paris, who had been charged with the management of the new enclo&s;ure and fortifications of that city un|der Charles V. The two towers with which the Ca&s;tle was fir&s;t built &s;erved as a defence a|gain&s;t the attacks of the Engli&s;h; but there were &s;oon afterwards added two, for the purpo&s;e of retreat, fronting to and parrallel with the fir&s;t. The entrance to Paris was lengthened by two &s;eperate towers and a double bridge. The ed|ifice was not completed until the reign of Charles VI. about the year 1383.&mdash;That monarch ad|ded four new towers at equal di&s;tances. He con&s;tructed apartments between the towers in the &s;olid walls, pulled down the bridges, and
<PB N="40" REF="030151_0037_0FE4AE871EABDA38">
&s;urrounded the whole eight towers by a dry ditch &s;unk twenty-five feet below the level of the &s;treet.</P>
<P>All the towers are &s;ecured at the bottom by &s;trong double doors, with enormous locks and bolts. The filthy dungeons beneath exhale the mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;tench, and are the common abodes of lizards, toads, rats, &s;piders, and almo&s;t eve|ry other &s;pecies of vermin.</P>
<P>It was in the&s;e dungeons that the tyrannical Lewis XI. confined tho&s;e who&s;e mi&s;erable lives he was de&s;irous of prolonging by gradual torture; &s;uch was his treatment of the princes of Armag|nac, who were placed in the&s;e dungeons, in holes &s;unk in the &s;tone-work into the forms of &s;ugar-loaves, terminating in points, &s;o con&s;tructed to deprive their feet of re&s;t, and their wearied and tortured bodies of all po&s;&s;ibility of repo&s;e; from this mi&s;erable &s;ituation they were taken twice a week&mdash;to receive the &s;courge, under the in&s;pec|tion of Philip L'Huillier, then Governor of the Ba&s;tille; and at the end of every three months they had one or two teeth wrenched from their jaws. The elder of the&s;e princes at length went mad; but the younge&s;t was happy enough to be delivered from this dreadful incarceration, by the death of Lewis XI. and from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, da|ted 1483, we have obtained the&s;e facts, which could never have been credited, nor even imag|ined, without &s;o po&s;itive an evidence.</P>
<P>In a corner of each dungeon is placed a camp|bed, formed by planks laid acro&s;s iron bars &s;ix|ed in the wall. It is here they put &s;uch pri&s;on|ers as they wi&s;h to terrify into any mea&s;ure, and
<PB N="41" REF="030151_0038_0FE4AE8E44DA85F0">
allow them nothing but a little &s;traw for bed-fur|niture. Double doors, each &s;even inches thick, and fa&s;tened by mon&s;trous bolts, are the entran|ces to the&s;e horrid and dark dens.</P>
<P>After the dungeons the mo&s;t horrible are tho&s;e containing iron cages, which are three in num|ber. The&s;e cages are formed of beams, ca&s;ed with &s;trong plates of iron; and are eight feet high by &s;ix feet wide.</P>
<P>[It is not the intention of the Publi&s;her to give a full account of the ca&s;tle, towers, &amp;c. of the Ba&s;tille, as the limits of this &s;mall pamphlet will not allow of it, but what has been &s;aid will un|doubtedly give the Reader an idea of that infa|mous pri&s;on.]</P>

<P>CHARLES de Gontault, Duc de Biron, Peer, Admiral, and Marechal of France, and Governor of the Port of Bre&s;t, at a time when he was loaded with favours by Henry IV. entered into a corre&s;pondence with the Spaniards and the Duke of Savoy, at that time the profe&s;|&s;ed enemies of the nation, who flattered him with hopes of obtaining at their hands the &s;overeignty

of the Duchy of Burgundy, and that of Fran|che Comte, as a portion with a daughter either of the King of Spain or of the Duke of Savoy, whom they promi&s;ed to give him in marriage. Henry IV. having di&s;covered the plot, immedi|ately taxed Biron with it, who denied the crime with unconquerable audacity. The Parliament of Paris gave orders for his trial. He was found guilty of the crime of high trea&s;on again&s;t his King and Country, and condemned to lo&s;e his head, by an Arret of the 29th July 1602; which &s;entence was executed on the 31&s;t of the &s;ame month, in the interior court of the Ba&s;tille.</P>

<P>In 1674, Louis Chevalier de Rohan, Grand Veneur of France, having lo&s;t his baggage in a &s;kirmi&s;h, on its being rifled, certain letters were found which gave ground of &s;u&s;picion, that he was engaged in a traiterous de&s;ign to deliver Havre|de-Grace into the hands of the Engli&s;h. In con&s;equence of this di&s;covery he was &s;eized and thrown into the Ba&s;tille. The Sieur de la Tuan|derie, who was his emi&s;&s;ary in the bu&s;ine&s;s, hid him&s;elf immediately on hearing the news of his principal's arre&s;t. Sufficient proofs not being brought forward again&s;t de Rohan, a commi&s;|&s;ion was created which a&s;&s;umed to it&s;elf the of|fice of drawing up documents for convicting him of trea&s;on. La Tuanderie was di&s;covered at Rouen, whither proper officers were di&s;patched to apprehend him; but perceiving his ca&s;e to be de&s;perate, he fired on his a&s;&s;ailants, and was immediately killed on the &s;pot. The friends of the Chevalier de Rohan repaired every night to
<PB N="43" REF="030151_0040_0FE4AE9154DF2B90">
the Ba&s;tille, which they circumambulated, cry|ing ince&s;&s;antly, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;peaking-trumpet, <Q>La Tuanderie is dead, and has con|fe&s;&s;ed nothing;</Q> but this was never heard by the Chevalier. The Commi&s;&s;ioners finding that they could draw nothing from him, told him, <Q>That the King knew the whole of the fact, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of convincing proofs; that they only waited his confe&s;&s;ion; and that they had authority to promi&s;e him a pardon upon the &s;ingle condition, that he &s;hould declare the truth of the matter.</Q> The too credulous Che|valier avowed the trea&s;on; when, in an in&s;tant the perfidious wretches changed their tone, and told him, that it was true, they could not en&s;ure his pardon, but that they had great hopes of ob|taining it, and would go immediately to &s;olicit it. Notwith&s;tanding this promi&s;e, they felt no compunction in pronouncing, &s;oon after, the dreadful &s;entence of his death. The Chevalier was condemned to lo&s;e his head; and on the 27th November 1674, he was conducted on foot to the &s;caffold, along a gallery erected on a level with a window of the Fencing-&s;chool belonging to the Ar&s;enal, where he was executed&punc;</P>

<P>The Sieur Vaillant, a worthy eccle&s;ia&s;tic, but who had been unfortunate enough to have been concerned in the affair of the too-famous Bull, was confined in the Ba&s;tille from 1728 to 1731. He was a &s;econd time thrown into that pri&s;on in 1734. Some hot-headed fanatics were &s;edu|ced, either by bribes or other means, to &s;pread a report, <Q>That this prie&s;t was the prophet Elias,
<PB N="44" REF="030151_0041_0FE4AE93DA16DD10">
lately de&s;cended upon the earth; that he was now in the Ba&s;tille, but would &s;oon be taken thence and put to death.</Q> The parti&s;ans of this eccle&s;ia&s;tic obtained the common appellation of Vaillanti&s;ts. In a cour&s;e of time, the rigour with which he was treated in the Ba&s;tille, to|gether with his own au&s;terities, turned his brain. He harboured at times the idea that he was indeed the prophet Elias; and firmly believing that he &s;hould one day be caught up in a whirlwind of fire, he made no &s;cruple of hone&s;tly communica|ting this opinion to the officers of l'Etat-Major. On the 26th of January 1739 the chimney of his apartment took fire, and he welcomed the mo|ment, &s;o long expected, of his elevation; but the fire was &s;oon extingui&s;hed, and he remained under lock and key as u&s;ual. He now thought him&s;elf bound to make a ferious declaration in writing to the Lieutenant de Police, <Q>That he, Vaillant, was in no &s;en&s;e the Prophet Elias; that he did not repre&s;ent him, and that he had no authority for announcing him, or for ac|ting or &s;peaking in his name.</Q> Long &s;olitude impaired his intellects. Having entered the chapel one Sunday to hear ma&s;s, he &s;uddenly &s;eized the ve&s;tments, put on the cope, &amp;c. and began ma&s;s. The people called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the Major came, and tried in vain to &s;top the prie&s;t, who, quite regardle&s;s of all about him, continued the &s;ervice. The Major &s;eized him, the prie&s;t re&s;i&s;ted, and the champions at la&s;t col|lared each other. This &s;cene deprived the pri|&s;oner from ever again attending the ma&s;s. He was afterwards conveyed to Vincennos, where he died.</P>

<HEAD>IV:</HEAD>
<P>The Comte de Lally was near three years in the Ba&s;tille. He was of a violent di&s;po&s;ition, and one of his favourite maxims was, <Q>That he knew no plea&s;ure &s;o &s;weet as revenge; which was truly the plea&s;ure of the gods!</Q> He ad|ded. <Q>The Parliament will judge me with all the rigour of the laws; but the King will favour me and mitigate my &s;ufferings.</Q></P>
<P>He had permi&s;&s;ion to have his &s;ecretary to re|&s;ide with him; and this man he wearied out with perpetual vexation. One day the &s;ecreta|ry having ob&s;erved in the great Court a quanti|ty of coagulated blood, which had been drawn by phlebotomy from one of the &s;ick pri&s;oners, and which the &s;ervant had carele&s;sly thrown there, he conceived an idea that preparations were making for putting him to death, and im|mediately became di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>The Major of the Ba&s;tille received orders to conduct the Comte Lally to the palace, to un|dergo his final examination. M. le Pre&s;ident commanded that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to dive&s;t him of the rib|bon of his Order, and the other in&s;ignia of his dignities, but he refu&s;ed to perform that office, which was immediately executed by the Hu&s;&s;ars. The Comte was re-conducted to the Ba&s;tille, and all vi&s;its in future, and permi&s;&s;ion to walk out, were prohibited. The officers kept him comp|any by turns from this time till his execution, which did not take place till three or four days after his condemnation. In the mean time, his friends and relations took opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing in their carriage by the &s;ide of the gate St. Anto|ine,
<PB N="46" REF="030151_0043_0FE4AE9C3B236F50">
and before his window, making &s;igns to him to anticipate his fate by cutting his throat; but all their &s;ignals were u&s;ele&s;s; the pri&s;oner, ab&s;or|bed in reflection, never ca&s;t his eyes that way, and left to the executioner, what, had he per|ceived their in&s;tigations, he would certainly have &s;aved him the trouble of performing. The Ma|jor received orders, to remove Lally into, the Conciergerie, there to pa&s;s the night of horror preceding his execution, and to continue with him the whole time. Here he became reconci|led to that officer whom he had ever before de|te&s;ted. The next morning M. Pa&s;quier, a Councellor of Parliament, &s;aid to him, <Q>The King is full of mercy, and will certainly par|don you if you will declare every thing you know of your two accomplices, &amp;c.</Q> Lally flew into a rage, called M. Pa&s;quier a perfidious man, abu&s;ed him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner, and poured out on him the mo&s;t horrid imprecations and bla&s;phemies. The magi&s;trate gave imme|diate orders for gagging him; but &s;oon after, the confe&s;&s;or appearing, the gag was taken out of his mouth. He then made a feint of removing a little on one &s;ide, drew a point of a compa&s;s, which he had ingeniou&s;ly concealed, and &s;tabbed him&s;elf with great violence, with a full de&s;ign of preventing the ignominy which was preparing before his eyes. The attendants however per|ceived and di&s;armed him, when he vehemently exclaimed; "F&mdash;, I have mi&s;&s;ed the blow!" The &s;urgeon found the wound not mortal; he became gradually more calm, was confe&s;&s;ed, and &s;oon after executed, May 1766.</P>
