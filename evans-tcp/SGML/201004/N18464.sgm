<HEAD>TO THE PARISHONERS OF ST. SAVIOUR's SOUTHWARK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear People,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Dialogues were written by a worthy clergyman of our own church, and have been already made very u&s;eful to many per&s;ons. In hopes that they will be made equally u&s;eful to <HI>you,</HI> I am encouraged to re-print them, and to put them into your hands&mdash;They contain the &s;ub&s;tance of what I have delivered to you from the pulpit, and are entirely agreeable to the doctrine of Scripture, and of the church of <HI>England,</HI> I may therefore, with great &s;afety, recommend them (as I hereby do) to your &s;erious and attentive peru&s;al. I have long had it upon my mind, that it was my bounden duty, as your mini&s;ter to vi&s;i&s;t you "from hou&s;e to hou&s;e," and enforce the truths of the go&s;pel upon you. I am now determined by the the grace of God, to &s;et about this important part of my office&mdash;Let me hope my dear people will give me a favourable reception, and pay a regard to my well-meant admonitions. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to addre&s;s every per&s;on, in this large and populous pari&s;h, &s;o particularly as could be wi&s;hed: permit me, therefore, to convey my ad|vice in the following Dialogues. They &s;peak my
<PB N="iv" REF="023952_0003_0FC35A4683F9A3A0">
whole heart upon the matter, and are &s;o judiciou&s;ly executed, that, while the mo&s;t improved readers will find much in them both for edification and de|light, the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t capacities may under|&s;tand and be benefited by them. Let me then intreat your candid attention to the&s;e Dialogues. They con|tain whatever I would &s;ay to you one by one, were I to addre&s;s you &s;ingly, and are much better executed than any thing of my own upon the &s;ubject would be. It may not be ami&s;s to add that they are wrote by a father in Chri&s;t, one who has a pari&s;h of his own, and who is a faithful preacher of the go&s;pel of our dear Saviour. God grant you may read them in the &s;ame &s;pirit they were wrote in! then I am per&s;uaded you will receive a ble&s;&s;ing from the peru&s;al. In the name of my Ma&s;ter then, I pay you this friendly vi|&s;it, and intreat your acceptance of this little book. For his &s;ake I be&s;eech you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the truths contained therein. Tho&s;e of you who live without any concern for your poor &s;ouls, I would earne&s;tly call upon to attend with diligence to the "things that belong unto their peace." The&s;e, and all &s;uch as are contented with a bare profe&s;&s;ion, and the mere externals of religion, would do well to con&s;ider the fir&s;t Dialogue. Tho&s;e of you who are &s;eeking the kingdom of heaven (and I tru&s;t I have many &s;uch among you) will find &s;ome u&s;eful directi|ons in the &s;econd; and the &s;oul, which is ju&s;tified by faith, will meet with very profitable in&s;truction in the third. I would advi&s;e you, however, to give them all a &s;erious reading; although I recommend it to you to fix your particular attention upon that Di|alogue that &s;uits your &s;tate&mdash;My dear brethren, I wi&s;h you knew how earne&s;tly I "long for your &s;ouls "in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" how &s;incerely I de&s;ire your &s;alvation. An eternity is before you: Oh that I might be in&s;trumental to your finding that eter|nity a ble&s;&s;ed one! With this de&s;ire I beg leave to wait on you and pre&s;ent you with the&s;e Dialogues.
<PB N="v" REF="023952_0004_0FC35A48ED551E28">
I need no apology for taking this liberty, &s;ince my office allows me to take it. I would rather a&s;k Par|don for having neglected it &s;o long. But, for the future, I intend, God willing, to renew my vi&s;its once a year, while he &s;hall &s;pare me to "labour among&s;t you." I likewi&s;e invite all &s;uch of my pa|ri&s;h as are willing to receive any little in&s;tructions I can give them, the poore&s;t among you I invite, to come to me whenever they chu&s;e, with all the freedom of a friend, and with all the confidence of a brother. My dear people, indeed I bear you on my heart. Were you my parents or my brethren, I could not love you more affectionately than I do. "I &s;eek not yours but you," only glorify my ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, by &s;triving in earne&s;t to enter into the kingdom of heaven, and I have my reward.&mdash;May the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us incline your hearts to &s;eek his face here, that you may be glorified with him hereafter! This, you may be a&s;&s;ured is my hearty prayer to God for you. I often remember you at the throne of grace, let me intreat <HI>your</HI> prayers for <HI>me</HI> in return. I am, with great re&s;pect and e&s;teem.</P>

<P>DIALOGUE I. BETWEEN A <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> and one of his <HI>Pari&s;hioners.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>FARMER, good-morrow. I find you have been early up, and diligently employed: Your cattle are fed, and &s;ervants at work. I &s;ee thriving in the world is a matter very near your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, all this is nece&s;&s;ary. Meat and cloaths mu&s;t be provided; the lord's rent mu&s;t be paid; and this requires much care and labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would by no means di&s;courage your indu&s;try. It is your duty to be <HI>not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> But, you know, you have another calling be&s;ides hu&s;bandry: The &s;oul mu&s;t be fed and cloathed too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtle&s;s the &s;oul ought to be minded in the fir&s;t place, for that is the chief concern: But I hope I do not neglect my &s;oul and the world to come: I &s;hould be &s;orry you &s;hould think me &s;o bad a man: I believe you have no rea&s;on&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No particular rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;picious of you rather than others. But when I look round, and ob|&s;erve the general unconcern about &s;alvation in which men live, I am concerned for my fellow-mortals: And with re&s;pect to you of this pari&s;h in particular. I think my&s;elf obliged to admoni&s;h you of your dan|ger, that you may not die before you have obtained forgivene&s;s of your &s;ins through faith in JESUS CHRIST, and <HI>an inheritance among them that are &s;anc|tified.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! Sir, why &s;hould you entertain &s;uch un|charitable thoughts of us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not &s;o abu&s;e the word <HI>charity:</HI> It &s;ignifies the &s;ame as <HI>love.</HI> Now love does not require that we think well of every body with or without rea&s;on, but that we wi&s;h and intend well to every body. If I gave my&s;elf no trouble about you, that is, if I was utterly void of charity, you would think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> very charitable man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you do not condemn us all: Some of us indeed are wicked, &s;wearing, drunken men; but we are not all &s;o. You know your&s;elf that I keep my church, and come &s;ometimes to &s;acrament. I never hurted any man in my life, and pay every man his due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon this you build your hopes of hea|ven?&mdash;If this is your foundation, I mu&s;t plainly tell you, it will leave you hopele&s;s in the day of trial. Let us examine it by the word of God.</P>
<P>"You never did any hurt to any man." You mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, you never robbed nor murdered any per&s;on: I do not think you have; but &s;till you have committed much &s;in, and done much hurt, not only to others, but e&s;pecially to your own &s;oul, by great and numberle&s;s, nay daily offences again&s;t the holy law of GOD. Nay you have broken every one of his commandments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who could give you &s;uch an account of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You your&s;elf, la&s;t Lord's day. When you heard me repeat the commandments, you made an|&s;wer after each of them, <HI>Lord, have mercy upon me,</HI> &amp;c. Your calling for mercy was plainly acknowledg|ing your&s;elf guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never committed <HI>idolatry, murder, adultery</HI>&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all of them. Have you never loved any worldly thing more than God and his favour? not feared any thing more than his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;o as to neglect a known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> rather than draw upon your|&s;elf &s;ome temporal inconvenience? This was a breach
<PB N="9" REF="023952_0007_0FC35A5D4CE52D90">
of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> commandment. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> command|ment re&s;pects the <HI>manner of expre&s;&s;ing</HI> the devotion of the heart; and therefore, whatever in your &s;er|vice has been unbecoming, &s;uch as <HI>wandering thoughts, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>irreverence,</HI> as well as <HI>u&s;ing images,</HI> is a breach of this commandment: So is al&s;o neglect of GOD's &s;ervice. And here you will not pretend, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be <HI>not guilty.</HI> Con&s;equently your com|ing to church and &s;acrament in this manner de&s;erves rather to be reckoned among your &s;ins, than tu&s;ted to for ju&s;tification before GOD. But a few minutes ago, in my hearing, you <HI>took the Lord's name in vain,</HI> u&s;ing it needle&s;ly, and without an awful &s;en&s;e, of his Maje&s;ty, of whom you &s;pake. You have done the &s;ame perhaps ten thou&s;and times in your life. This is a breach of the <HI>third</HI> commandment. Whenever you have neglected to attend on GOD's wor&s;hip on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> without a nece&s;&s;ary hindrance, &s;uffered worldly thoughts to unfit you for GOD's &s;ervice, done worldly bu&s;ine&s;s on that day that might be done on another, and neglected to devote the whole to GOD, by <HI>reading, hearing, prayer, meditation</HI> and <HI>u&s;e|ful conver&s;ation</HI>&mdash;you have profaned the LORD's day. The &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e commandments is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>with all thy heart:</HI> But you have come &s;hort of this whenever you have not acted to the glory of GOD. Now what think you of your innocence with re&s;pect to the duties of the fir&s;t table?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot pretend to ju&s;tify my&s;elf with re|&s;pect to GOD; but I am &s;ure I have done no hurt to <HI>man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would not &s;ay &s;o, if you under&s;tood the &s;pirituality and extent of GOD's commandments, as explained by our LORD in his <HI>&s;ermon on the mount.</HI> There you find that <HI>concupi&s;cence</HI> in the eye or heart is e&s;teemed <HI>adultery</HI> in the &s;ight of GOD; and cau&s;e|le&s;s <HI>anger,</HI> and e&s;pecially injurious language, is ac|counted a degree of <HI>murder:</HI> And who can acquit him&s;elf of the&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="023952_0008_0FC35A6621E5AC60">If you take the &s;ame method to under&s;tand the o|ther commandments, all parts of your behaviour that are un&s;uitable to the &s;tation in which Providence hath placed you, all <HI>irreverence</HI> and proud cen&s;uring of your <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> and all unkind and injurious treat|ment of tho&s;e that are <HI>beneath</HI> you, will appear to be breaches of the <HI>fifth</HI> commandment. All <HI>evil &s;peaking, ra&s;h cen&s;uring,</HI> and <HI>repeating of &s;tories</HI> injurous to the characters of others, are contrary to the <HI>ninth:</HI> And all <HI>murmuring</HI> and <HI>di&s;content, envy</HI> and <HI>greedine&s;s,</HI> are &s;ins forbidden by the <HI>tenth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it &s;eems there is but one commandment again&s;t which I have not &s;inned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you rightly knew your&s;elf and the law of GOD, you would not acquit your&s;elf of that neither. Be not offended, I &s;peak out of love to your &s;oul. I do not think you a thief or a robber: Yet, have you never concealed the faults and bad properties of what you &s;old, when you knew that ignorance of the&s;e faults was the very thing that induced the per&s;on to buy? Nay, have you often recommended your goods in &s;uch general terms, as were incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict truth? Have you not cruelly taken ad|vantage of the nece&s;&s;ity of a needy &s;eller, and beat down his ware much below its real value? The&s;e will certainly witne&s;s again&s;t you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, after this rate you condemn all the world. According to your account, there is not a good man upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not <HI>my</HI> account, but the &s;cripture account: <HI>There is none that doeth good, no not one,</HI> Rom. iii. 12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad then you do not think me wor&s;e than my neighbours. I hope I &s;hall do as well as others, for all are &s;inners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore you think you need not be grealty troubled, if you are &s;o too; but hope to pa&s;s in the crowd. Does not &s;ome &s;uch thought as that lurk at the bottom? But what &s;ignify numbers with GOD, who&s;e all &s;earching eye no man can lie concealed
<PB N="11" REF="023952_0009_0FC35A6B4A90D580">
from, and who&s;e arm none can re&s;i&s;t or e&s;cape? Had you lived in <HI>Sodom,</HI> or the old world, this &s;ame thought might have lulled you a&s;leep in the prevail|ing abominations, but would not &s;ave you from the overflowing <HI>deluge,</HI> nor the &s;treams of <HI>fire.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>After this rate you damn all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Damn!</HI> What a word is that? It &s;ignifies to adjudge to eternal torment, to do which belongeth only to the righteous Judge. I would with all my &s;oul re&s;cue all men from this mi&s;ery. And with that view I now &s;peak plainly and faithfully to you, and agreeably to the word of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who then can be &s;aved? Not you your&s;elf. Pray, Sir, did you never &s;in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, be &s;erious. The &s;ubject we are now upon is of the utmo&s;t importance. I have &s;inned as well as you; I have greatly &s;inned, and my &s;ins have de&s;erved eternal damnation: But GOD hath been plea&s;ed to awaken me to repentance, he hath &s;hewn me my danger, and &s;tirred me up to <HI>flee from the wrath to come.</HI> He hath &s;hewn me al&s;o the way of e&s;caping the wages of &s;in, opened in the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel.</HI> The tender of &s;alvation there made I tru&s;t I have em|braced, and obtained forgivene&s;s through faith in JESUS CHRIST.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I have repented too: I am &s;ure, if I of|fend GOD, I am &s;orry for it afterwards. And for faith, why, we are all <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> I hope, are we not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your <HI>repentance</HI> is <HI>&s;incere,</HI> and your <HI>faith lively</HI> and &s;aving, your &s;tate is &s;afe and happy. But many per&s;ons deceive them&s;elves by a <HI>dead faith</HI> and <HI>imperfect repentance.</HI> Are you willing to have the &s;incerity of yours tried?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am; for the trial can do me no hurt. If I am &s;afe, it is well; if I am not, I hope it is not too late to amend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ay very right. Fir&s;t, then, let us examine your <HI>repentance.</HI> Now true repentance implies a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, its odiou&s;ne&s;s and deformity, a hatred of it,
<PB N="12" REF="023952_0010_0FC35A6BF41BF358">
humilation and &s;elf loathing on account of it, an actual for&s;aking of it, and a turning to GOD by new|ne&s;s of life. Is your repentance &s;uch as this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The wages of &s;in is death,</HI> eternal death. Do you think you de&s;erve this death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as other men, for all are &s;inners: But GOD is merciful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not now talk of other men. Do you <HI>A. B.</HI> think that you de&s;erve eternal death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>If GOD &s;hould deal with me according to &s;trict ju&s;tice, I do: But as I think GOD is merciful, &s;o I hope I &s;hall do well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear your notions of GOD'S mercy are &s;uch as <HI>prevent</HI> true repentance. You &s;eem to have enter|tained hopes of mercy, without being deeply &s;en&s;i|ble of your utter mi&s;ery without it; to have applied the healing bal&s;am, before you were wounded. This is what the Almighty &s;tiles <HI>healing the wounds of his people &s;lightly.</HI> Now you &s;eem in this manner to have deceived your&s;elf. You never &s;aw your&s;elf in a &s;tate of &s;in and death; you never &s;aw &s;in odious; you were never greatly afraid of peri&s;hing, nor &s;aw that there was no help or &s;trength in your&s;elf; therefore you never fled to him that is a <HI>refuge from the &s;torm.</HI> And, if you never fled thus to CHRIST, as helple&s;s and undone without him, it is plain that you are &s;till without any &s;aving intere&s;t in him.</P>
<P>See how it was with tho&s;e converts mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles: <HI>Peter's</HI> hearers were <HI>prick|ed in their hearts, and &s;aid, Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do?</HI> The <HI>goaler</HI> came trembling, through a &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;erable condition before he was baptiz|ed, and received forgivene&s;s of &s;ins. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;truck to the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the&s;e were infidels, I was baptized in my infaney, and bred up to know good things, and al|ways believed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOD does not deal with all exactly in the &s;ame way. But take heed you do not depend too much
<PB N="13" REF="023952_0011_0FC35A70F2ED79C0">
upon the&s;e privileges. You were early baptized; but &s;earch your heart and life. Have you not lived for a long time together as <HI>without God in the world?</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>renouncing</HI> the <HI>world,</HI> and <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> and <HI>devil,</HI> have you not <HI>followed,</HI> and <HI>been led by them?</HI> Have you not been led by the world in judging of things according to the opinions of men, in oppo&s;ition to the word of GOD? Have you not in many things conformed to its cu&s;toms, contrary to the commands of GOD? Have you not frequently obeyed your <HI>car|nal lu&s;ts</HI> and <HI>inclinations,</HI> &s;o as to violate frequently the pure law of GOD, if not by actual offences, yet by indulging evil thoughts, and living in le&s;&s;er &s;ins without concern? And has not the <HI>devil</HI> been for a con&s;iderable time your ma&s;ter, leading you to of|fend GOD by profaning his holy name and holy day, and that for the &s;ake of &s;uch a trifling plea&s;ure, as plainly argues his a&s;cendancy over you? And have you not continued &s;till in the&s;e things with little or no concern, hoping not with&s;tanding that all would be well? Nay, is not this &s;till in &s;ome mea&s;ure your ca&s;e?&mdash; I &s;ee you acknowledge it is. It is plain then, your bapti&s;mal vow and covenant is broken; and there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of turning unto GOD, and begining all anew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>How mu&s;t I begin anew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By acknowledging that by your departure from God you have brought your&s;elf to a <HI>&s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery; alienated from</HI> GOD, inclined to evil, and therefore at <HI>enmity with</HI> GOD in your heart; that for the&s;e things you de&s;erve his wrath, and &s;tand on the brink of ruin, covered with guilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to for&s;ake all &s;in, turn to GOD, and do better. Will that do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are good re&s;olutions, but they do not &s;eem to proceed from a right principle.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I would have you de&s;pair of all help from your&s;elf, or on account of any thing you have done, or can do; for till then you will not &s;ufficient|ly value JESUS CHRIST, nor fly to him as your only Saviour, who <HI>came to preach deliverance to the captives,</HI> and to <HI>bind up the broken-hearted.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe all this may be nece&s;&s;ary for a <HI>notori|ous &s;inner,</HI> or an <HI>heathen;</HI> but I have lived in &s;ome fear of GOD, kept my church, and always believed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt you never believed at all, properly &s;peaking: But of this I will talk more with you an|other time. At pre&s;ent, it is plain, your <HI>repentance</HI> has not been <HI>real.</HI> You never &s;aw and felt your dan|ger, con&s;equently could never be &s;o de&s;irous of e&s;cap|ing it as is nece&s;&s;ary. You always flattered your|&s;elf with &s;ome hopes that your &s;tate was &s;afe, or cer|tainly would be, when you lived a little better; which was at bottom depending on your&s;elf, with re&s;pect to the branches of repentance, &s;uch as <HI>for|&s;aking &s;in</HI>&mdash;it is evident to your&s;elf you have lived without concern in &s;ome le&s;&s;er habitual &s;ins ; and, as for <HI>turning to</HI> GOD, you were never &s;en&s;ible, that in the <HI>&s;tream of your affections</HI> and <HI>the general cour&s;e of your life,</HI> you were turned from him.</P>
<P>Indeed (though you &s;eem not to know it) the ru|ling principle in you, and every <HI>natural man,</HI> is a
<PB N="15" REF="023952_0013_0FC35A7375413D60">
principle of &s;in and corruption. In&s;tead of &s;eeking to plea&s;e GOD, you have all along been &s;eeking to plea&s;e your&s;elf; to procure &s;ome gratification to cor|rupted nature, &s;uch as &s;en&s;ual delights, riches, world|ly e&s;teem, ea&s;e, or the like. This hath been the acting principle throughout your whole conduct, in|&s;tead of obeying that command, <HI>do all to the glory of GOD.</HI> Nay, if you &s;earch narrowly, you will find in your heart an <HI>enmity again&s;t GOD.</HI> For &s;o &s;aith the apo&s;tle, Rom. viii. 7. <HI>The carnal mind</HI> (and &s;uch is every man's by nature) is <HI>enmity again&s;t GOD.</HI> And this <HI>enmity</HI> &s;hews it&s;elf in oppo&s;ing GOD's will, by doing what he hath forbidden, and leaving undone what he hath commanded; and al&s;o in flying from GOD as your enemy, and endeavouring to hide your|&s;elf from him like <HI>Adam.</HI> Have you not pa&s;&s;ed days and weeks without one &s;erious thought of GOD, though you were all that time receiving mercies at his hand? Have you not bani&s;hed and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;uch thoughts, when they have ri&s;en in your mind? Have you not fled from &s;erious thoughts of GOD and eternity, as enemies to your peace, and drown|ed them in worldly cares, vain conver&s;ation, and idle amu&s;ements? Have you not thus fled from GOD, You know you have.&mdash;Hitherto, &s;uffer me to be plain with you, you have gone wrong, and have been in&s;en&s;ible of your danger, deceived your&s;elf, and <HI>&s;poken peace</HI> to your &s;oul, <HI>when there was no peace.</HI> Now con|&s;ider what you have heard from me, read your Bible, examine your&s;elf, and pray unto GOD to give you a &s;en&s;e of your real &s;tate, and a right judgement in all things.</P>

<P>I did think &s;o then. You &s;eemed to judge too hardly of me, and to put me on the level with the wor&s;t of men. But I am now convinced that what you &s;aid was all true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has produced this change in your &s;enti|ments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ye&s;terday's &s;ermon about the day of judg|ment. I have been very unea&s;y ever &s;ince I heard it. For I am greatly afraid, that, if the day of judgment was now to come, it would find me unprepared. And then&mdash;the LORD have mercy upon my poor &s;oul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be too late then to cry and hope for mercy. But what was it particularly that made you form &s;uch a judgment of your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hewed us from the twenty-fifth chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> that judgment <HI>begins</HI> with a &s;epara|tion of the <HI>godly</HI> from the <HI>wicked?</HI> and this &s;eparati|on was owing to a &s;eparation made in this life, when the righteous were taken from among the wicked; by leaving the works and the &s;ociety of the ungod|ly. I was not &s;en&s;ible any &s;uch change had been wrought in me, and am therefore afraid I am &s;till in the &s;tate of &s;in, in which you told us all men are by nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have great rea&s;on to be afraid. I told you, that tho&s;e would be e&s;teemed <HI>righteous</HI> on that
<PB N="17" REF="023952_0015_0FC35A8CCDDCEF58">
day, who had fled to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for righteou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify them, and had been made ho|ly by the Spirit of GOD, creating in them a <HI>new heart,</HI> and had evidenced this change by an holy conver&s;a|tion through the remaining part of their life, how many or great &s;oever their &s;ins had been: And that the <HI>wicked</HI> were tho&s;e that had lived and died with|out faith in CHRIST, and the indwelling of GOD's Spirit, however orderly and decent their conduct was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that was it that terriffed <HI>me.</HI> You told us that the mo&s;t upright man had committed &s;ins enough to condemn him, if he died without an intere&s;t in CHRIST, and without being accepted as righteous through <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>But if this mercy and acceptance through JESUS CHRIST, were obtained before death, no man's &s;ins would be remembered again&s;t him in that day. And to prove this, you &s;hewed us, that in the proceed|ings of the la&s;t day, as related by St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> no &s;ins of the righteous are mentioned by the Judge, nor any good deeds of the wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>wicked,</HI> that is, they that lived and died without an humbling &s;en&s;e of their natural corrupti|on and actual &s;ins, &s;o as never by faith to fly for re|fuge to GOD's mercy in CHRIST, have, properly &s;peaking, no good works to be mentioned, for all they do is from a wrong principle; either for &s;elfi&s;h or worldly ends, or in order to be accepted on ac|count of their <HI>doings;</HI> which is &s;eeking &s;alvation <HI>by the law of works.</HI> On this account their works are not regarded, being not <HI>done in faith;</HI> that is, not proceeding from an union with CHRIST by faith, <HI>without whom we can do nothing</HI> acceptable in GOD's &s;ight. <HI>John</HI> xv. 5. On the other hand, the <HI>righte|ous</HI> being them&s;elves accepted through CHRIST, their &s;ins are not mentioned, becau&s;e long before <HI>forgiven</HI> and <HI>blotted out:</HI> And their <HI>imperfect &s;ervices</HI> being ac|cepted through JESUS their <HI>High-prie&s;t,</HI> who <HI>bears
<PB N="18" REF="023952_0016_0FC35AA6C02648C8">
the iniquity of their holy things,</HI> receive at the hands of their bountiful <HI>Judge</HI> a reward of grace. So that which <HI>principally</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>godly</HI> from the <HI>un|godly,</HI> is, that the one is accepted as righteous, and has obtained forgivene&s;s through CHRIST, according to the new or go&s;pel covenant: The other, never being deeply &s;en&s;ible of his &s;inful lo&s;t &s;tate (indeed too proud to acknowledge it) hath not applied for the mercy repre&s;ented in the go&s;pel, and &s;o at the day of judgment &s;tands on his own bottom, without a mediator, and without forgivene&s;s, and therefore mu&s;t be condemned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then why are works mentioned at all on that day, as we find they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I gave you two rea&s;ons for this. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e though they are not the ground of man's acceptance, yet they &s;hew a man to be in a ju&s;tified &s;tate; for we cannot <HI>bear</HI> the fruit of holine&s;s, unle&s;s we are <HI>in</HI> and <HI>abide in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>John</HI> xv. 4. And they that do not act righteou&s;ly deceive them&s;elves, if they think them&s;elves righteous; &s;o that good works &s;erve to di|&s;tingui&s;h <HI>believers</HI> from <HI>unbelievers. Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e the different degrees of fruitfulne&s;s make a difference between the godly them&s;elves, &s;o that GOD is plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to confer upon them different degrees of glory. That any man is at all &s;aved is owing to his faith in the <HI>Redeemer:</HI> His degree of glory is propor|tioned to his fruitfulne&s;s and diligence in the vinyard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always thought that we <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> were all <HI>be|lievers,</HI> one as much as another: And that at the day of judgment they would be reckoned <HI>godly</HI> that lived <HI>orderly</HI> and <HI>uprightly,</HI> among whom I reckoned my&s;elf and all were better than I; and that the <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>ungodly,</HI> and all that were <HI>&s;ecretly wicked</HI> and <HI>ill-de&s;igned,</HI> would be condemned. Indeed I had always &s;ome fears that I was not <HI>good enough:</HI> I did not know how great a number would be acknowledged righteous; but I thought I &s;tood a better chance than many, or mo&s;t that I knew.</P>

<P>I &s;ee that all depends on my obtaining, whil&s;t on earth, mercy and forgivene&s;s of all that is pa&s;t; and that not on account of any thing done by me, but through faith in JESUS CHRIST. But what that faith is I know not: This I know, that I have been all along out of the way.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been for &s;ome time &s;o as I was never in my life before: I have been afraid I &s;hould be damn|ed. This has filled me with thought and fears day and night.

of the &s;ins of my youth has followed me, as if committed but ye&s;terday. And &s;ome hard &s;crip|tures, that I have heard and read, &s;eem to be &s;en|tences of <HI>my</HI> condemnation. I believe I have thought an hundred times of tho&s;e words: <HI>The wages of &s;in is death.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not u&s;e to under&s;tand what you meant by <HI>looking into the heart;</HI> but I think I do now. I find in my&s;elf a &s;trong inclination to many &s;ins, notwith|&s;tanding that I am convinced in my mind that I de|&s;erve God's wrath on account of complying with the&s;e inclinations heretofore. Indeed it is much better with me now than it was. Formerly I have been led by my own wicked heart to delight in idle com|pany; to talk of my&s;elf in an empty vain manner; to be greedy after the world; to pa&s;s &s;lightly over, or entirely neglect prayer, and other duties, as a tedious burthen; and to be guilty of other &s;ins. At pre&s;ent I ble&s;s God, it is not &s;o; but all my thoughts are, in a manner taken up about the care of my &s;oul, and the world to come.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, you do not know your heart as well as you imagine. You &s;eem to think that <HI>all things are</HI> already <HI>become new</HI> in you. But be not deceived: Such a cage of unclean birds, as the heart of every man is by nature, is not &s;o &s;oon clean&s;ed from its va|rious lu&s;ts and vile affections. The&s;e that &s;eem to be rooted out are only a&s;leep for a &s;ea&s;on: Be watchful therefore; they will one day awake again. Some of them probably are only exchanged for others as bad and dangerous, &s;uch as <HI>pride, pre&s;umption,</HI> and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, I have had &s;ome fear of that. For you mu&s;t know that one day I was thinking what a &s;inful wretch I was, and what would become of me in the next world; when the&s;e words came &s;trongly into my mind; <HI>I will heal their back&s;lidings, I will love
<PB N="25" REF="023952_0023_0FC35AD885AA39D0">
them freely.</HI> I am &s;ure they are &s;omewhere in the Bible, but I cannot find them. However, they gave me much comfort, and I have been very ea&s;y ever &s;ince. Now a neighbour that I have been talking with, tells me, "This is to be looked on as a word from God," and that I am from henceforth to look on my&s;elf as a converted man. But I fear this would be pre&s;umption. Now what do you think of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t de&s;ire &s;ome time to re&s;olve this que&s;tion: &s;even years, at lea&s;t, before I can give a po&s;itive an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>The words you mentioned are in the prophet <HI>Ho|&s;ea,</HI> xiv. 4. They were perhaps &s;poken more im|mediately of the re&s;toration of the captive <HI>Jews:</HI> But they contain a &s;weet promi&s;e perfectly in the go&s;pel &s;train, and are therefore free for every hum|ble &s;oul to embrace by faith. The prophet you &s;ee at ver&s;e 1, 2, 3, exhorts the people to repentance and humiliation for &s;in: <HI>O I&s;rael, return unto the LORD thy GOD; for thou ha&s;t fallen by iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD. Say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciou&s;ly.&mdash; For in thee the fatherle&s;s findeth mercy.</HI> Now, as God hath given you a &s;en&s;e of your &s;inful, helple&s;s &s;tate, and a de&s;ire of turning to him, like this which the prophet here de&s;cribes as preparatory to an an&s;wer of peace. I hope the following promi&s;e belongs to you: <HI>I will heal their back&s;liding, I will love them free|ly; for my anger is turned away from him,</HI> ver&s;e 4. I hope too, that comfort, which you found in apply|ing the promi&s;e to your&s;elf by a particular faith, proceedeth from the Spirit of God. In the &s;ame manner as I look on that conviction of &s;in, which filled you with fear and &s;elf-aba&s;ement, when you called to mind your &s;infulne&s;s and God's judgment denounced again&s;t &s;inners, to be the work of the &s;ame Spirit. For it is he that <HI>convinceth the world of &s;in and of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> But this I mu&s;t tell you: All the&s;e feelings are to be &s;u&s;pected, till we &s;ee what
<PB N="26" REF="023952_0024_0FC35ADCB26AA590">
fruit follows in the heart and life. For though, the&s;e are &s;ometimes owing to the Spirit of God, and come well recommended, when, as in your ca&s;e, they are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the word of God; yet <HI>the enemy of &s;ouls</HI> &s;ometimes imitates the&s;e &s;en&s;ible expe|riences in order to deceive. And it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how much our natural temper and &s;pirit may contribute thereto.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Satan,</HI> I tell you, &s;ometimes puts on <HI>the ap|pearance of an angel of light,</HI> in order to deceive. Tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible experiences &s;ometimes vouch&s;afed by the Spirit of God, and impre&s;&s;ions made on mens minds, of which &s;ort are what the &s;cripture terms <HI>peace in believing</HI> and <HI>joy in the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>&mdash;the&s;e the <HI>enemy</HI> &s;ometimes imitates, and thereby deludes hy|pocrites into &s;piritual pride, and even the godly &s;ome times, &s;o as to <HI>puff</HI> them <HI>up,</HI> and make them &s;ecure and carele&s;s. But there are two tokens of grace, which the devil will not, cannot effect: The&s;e are an holy heart, &s;teadily hating &s;in; and an holy life, having re&s;pect to all God's commandments. Have the&s;e, and evidence the one by the other; and con|tinue for &s;ome con&s;iderable time thus to adorn your profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;Then I &s;hall not have the lea&s;t doubt but you are in a &s;tate of grace.</P>

<P>As far as I know my own heart, I would not willingly offend God for the whole world.

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Strive to make your calling and election &s;ure</HI> and evident both to your&s;elf and others, by <HI>bringing forth the fruit of righteou&s;ne&s;s in a good conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>My fir&s;t advice is, <HI>Be humble,</HI> and <HI>walk humbly with thy God.</HI> Let the remembrance of your pa&s;t life of &s;in and folly &s;till cover you with &s;hame. Recollect the many aggravating circum&s;tances of a life hitherto &s;pent in rebellion again&s;t God: During all which he daily heaped mercies upon you and yours; giving food and raiment, health and &s;trength; and continu|ed the&s;e mercies to you, while you forgot the hand that gave them, and returned evil for good. He <HI>&s;pared</HI> you in all your provocations; and at la&s;t open|ed your eyes to &s;ee your danger, &s;tirred you up to avoid it, and now hath given you a good hope through grace of obtaining eternal life. Thus compare to|gether what God has done and you de&s;erved, and thus learn <HI>humility.</HI> Keep a watchful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o upon the remains of indwelling &s;in &s;till in you. And let every &s;inful inclination, vain thought, backwardne&s;s to duty, and failure in it, teach you to be humble and fear. Thus, di&s;tru&s;ting your&s;elf, look up to God for continual &s;upport, like an helple&s;s little child; expecting, through the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in every time of need.</P>
<P>My next advice is, Keep <HI>a con&s;cience void of of|fence.</HI> If you have wronged any man, be not a&s;ham|ed to acknowledge it; and according to your power make re&s;titution: That the accur&s;ed thing may not cleave unto you. Take heed that you <HI>grieve not the Spirit</HI> of God by unholy walking, left you <HI>provoke him to for&s;ake you.</HI> To this end, watch over your
<PB N="28" REF="023952_0026_0FC35AEED1999D80">
heart, repre&s;s its fir&s;t inclinations to &s;in, and be watchful again&s;t temptations from without; fixing your eye e&s;pecially on the &s;ins with which you have heretofore been <HI>mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et.</HI> If at any time &s;in prevail again&s;t you, do not endeavour to forget it, or <HI>hide it in your bo&s;om:</HI> But go to God immediately; take &s;hame to your&s;elf: plead the go&s;pel promi&s;es to returning &s;inners, looking unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t as your all-&s;ufficient &s;acrifice, and <HI>advocate with the Father;</HI> and never cea&s;e wre&s;tling with God in Prayer, until he again &s;peak peace to your troubled &s;oul, and fill you with a greater fear of offending him.</P>
<P>As I hope you are now planted in God's vineyard, <HI>Be fruitful.</HI> Bear on your heart a &s;en&s;e of God's love to &s;inners in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Con&s;ider in particu|lar, what God hath done for you, in <HI>calling you out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light.</HI> Remember how you lay fa&s;t a&s;leep in &s;in and fatal &s;ecurity, when God awaked you to &s;ee your danger and e&s;cape it. Think what would have been your condition in eter|nity, if God had le&s;t you to your&s;elf. Think how many &s;till go on in the &s;ame fatal path in which you trod. And let the &s;en&s;e of God's di&s;tingui&s;hing love to you excite you to &s;ome return. <HI>Love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved you.</HI> And let love to your heavenly Fa|ther influence your <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>words,</HI> and <HI>actions.</HI></P>
<P>Let your <HI>meditations</HI> of God be &s;weet and frequent. Lift up your heart to him <HI>that &s;eeth in &s;ecret, and tri|eth the heart and reins.</HI> Seek a clo&s;e communion with the <HI>Father of your &s;pirit:</HI> And to this end, endea|vour to withdraw your thoughts from worldly things, and to rai&s;e your affections from earth to heaven, to tho&s;e things, which are not &s;een but by the eyes of faith. That thus you may <HI>walk by faith,</HI> guided by it as the eye of the &s;oul, and rai&s;ed by it to <HI>heavenly-mindedne&s;s;</HI> &s;o as to love and delight in God.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of your former vain <HI>conver&s;ation,</HI> hence|forth let your tongue be employed to God's glory; in <HI>&s;peaking good of his name;</HI> in prayer and prai&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="023952_0027_0FC35AF008D01E68">
to your great Benefactor; in telling others <HI>what he hath done for your &s;oul;</HI> in warning &s;inners of their danger, and encouraging them that fear God to be bold and hearty in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And let your <HI>conduct in life</HI> be &s;uch as becometh the go&s;pel. You are called to <HI>fight the good fight of faith;</HI> &s;ee that you <HI>faint not,</HI> neither be <HI>weary in well doing.</HI> Shew that you are <HI>alive unto GOD by living unto GOD,</HI> by devoting your&s;elf to his &s;ervice, and by diligence therein. Do &s;omething for him that hath done &s;o much for you. Be loving unto all men, for they are the work of God's hands: Do good unto all men according to your ability. Your time and &s;trength, and every other talent&punc; are given you to be improv|ed, lay them out in acts of charity and love.

<P>Shew a particular regard for <HI>them that are of the hou&s;hold of faith,</HI> all the &s;incerely godly, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. For as all men were originally created after God's image, in <HI>them</HI> is the image in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored. The&s;e therefore in a peculiar manner be|long to Chri&s;t, being wa&s;hed from their &s;ins in his

blood, and &s;anctified by his Spirit. And to animate you to greater diligence in this work and labour of love, view often with the eyes of faith the glorious reward &s;et before you, the eternal weight of glory to be be&s;towed on that day when Chri&s;t &s;hall reward acts of mercy and love, done in his name as if done to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Quickened by this principle, and encouraged by this pro&s;pect, &s;trive to grow in knowledge, and puri|ty, and faith, and love, and godly fear; in meek|ne&s;s, and every chri&s;tian grace.

Thus may you hope to be a fruitful vine, and experience in your &s;oul tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which the prophet im|mediately adds to that promi&s;e of free mercy, in which you have found &s;o much con&s;olation. <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> xiv. 5, 6, 7. <HI>I will be as the dew unto I&s;rael.
