<HEAD>PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE OF RE|PRESENTATIVES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the la&s;t Cen&s;or went to the pre&s;s, the long conte&s;ted and important que&s;tion on the treaty with Great Britain was &s;till undecided. Go! &s;aid I, gentle Cen&s;or, and, in thy mild and conciliating accents, be&s;eech the de&s;perate demagogues to &s;pare us a little longer.</P>
<P>A &s;ort of cloud had interpo&s;ed between the peo|ple and the &s;un of pro&s;perity. Terror had &s;eized on all tho&s;e who had &s;omething to lo&s;e; they knew not whether it was prudent to buy or to &s;ell, whe|ther their &s;hips were &s;afe&s;t in the harbour or out at &s;ea; the &s;ans-culottes began to grind their teeth and whet their couteaux, while the heads of the ari&s;tocrats &s;eemed to totter on their &s;houlders, and hang as it were by a bit of &s;kin.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="030223_0004_0FE52B371A483DB0">In this &s;ituation were we, when, on the 29th of April, the que&s;tion was taken in a committee of the whole Hou&s;e. The <HI>Ayes</HI> were 49 and the <HI>Noes</HI> 49: the Chairman, Mr. Muhlenberg of Penn|&s;ylvania gave the ca&s;ting vote in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Thus was the fate of a nation &s;u&s;pended upon the voice of one man, and thus have we once more narrowly e&s;caped war and anarchy.</P>
<P>Some benignant &s;ylph certainly whi&s;pered Mr. Muhlenberg in the ear; for, it is well known, that he had been a declared enemy to the treaty from the fir&s;t moment of its appearance. He was one of the leaders at the town meeting held at Philadel|phia on the 25th of July, 1795. At this meeting "the d&mdash;ned treaty was kicked to hell," and the a&s;&s;embly adjourned to go and break Mr. Bingham's windows. This meeting appointed a committee to draw up a memorial, praying the Pre&s;ident not to ratify the Treaty. The memorial after reprobating every article of the treaty &s;ingly, concludes thus: <Q>Your committee apprehend that great evils would re&s;ult to the&s;e States from this treaty, if ratified, they therefore recommend that an addre&s;s be prepared, and pre&s;ented to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, praying that he will not ratify the &s;aid treaty.</Q> Now, Mr. Muhlenberg was one of the very committee who drew up this memorial. Nor did his oppo&s;ition cea&s;e here; for we find him voting for the papers, and for the prote&s;ting re&s;o|lution of Mr. Blount. Had he not voted for this latter re&s;olution, I could have admitted, that he gave his ca&s;ting vote from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the Hou&s;e had no right to &s;et the treaty a&s;ide; but, in voting for the re&s;olution of Mr. Blount, he in|&s;i&s;ts on this right, and therefore the ca&s;ting vote
<PB N="174" REF="030223_0005_0FE4FE6C342EE300">
remains to be accounted for. Idle &s;tories go about: &s;lander is ever on the wing: for my part I am not one of tho&s;e who will give credit to nothing that he cannot &s;ee through: but I leave a my&s;tery as I find it. This miraculous conver&s;ion is certainly to be attributed to the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> power; to that power let us return our thanks, and not to Mr. Muhlenberg.</P>
<P>But though the re&s;olution for carrying the treaty into effect had pa&s;&s;ed in the committee, it had yet to get through the Hou&s;e, and much apprehen&s;ion was entertained for its &s;afety on the pa&s;&s;age. The oppo&s;ition was determined to di&s;pute the ground to the la&s;t inch; accordingly when the re&s;olution was taken up in the Hou&s;e, on the 30th, <HI>Mr. Dear|born</HI> moved the following preamble to it: <Q>That although in the opinion of this Hou&s;e the trea|ty is <HI>highly objectionable</HI> and <HI>may prove injurious to the United States,</HI> yet, con&s;idering all the cir|cum&s;tances relating thereto, particularly that the la&s;t 18 articles are to continue in force only dur|ing the pre&s;ent war, and two years thereafter, and confiding al&s;o in the efficacy of mea&s;ures which may be taken for bringing about a di&s;con|tinuance of the violations committed on our neutral rights, in regard to our ve&s;&s;els and &s;ea|men, therefore;</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t &s;hift of a baffled &s;action. <Q>If you do carry the treaty, &s;aid they your re&s;olution &s;hall contain the proofs of your own folly and incon|&s;i&s;tency.</Q> The plan was well laid: it was expect|ed that &s;ome of the members, who had voted for the re&s;olution the day before, would al&s;o vote for the preamble; nor was this improbable; any in con&s;i&s;tency might be expected from &s;ome of them</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="030223_0006_0FE52B389C3CB2E0">Mr. Muhlenberg, as if afraid of being out|&s;tripped by Mr. Chri&s;tie and &s;ome others, ha&s;ten|ed to give the preamble his entire approbation, and did at la&s;t actually vote for it. Thus, we &s;ee this gentleman, fir&s;t oppo&s;ing the treaty at a town meet|ing, and drawing up a memorial be&s;eeching the Pre&s;ident not to ratify it; then we find him voting for a re&s;olution that declares the Hou&s;e to have a right to &s;et the treaty a&s;ide; but, when called on for his ca&s;ting voice, he &s;eems to have forgotten all about the evil tendency of the treaty and the unmaking power of the Hou&s;e. Sleep, however, &s;eems to have refre&s;hed his memory, and we find him, next day, voting for a preamble, that de|clares this treaty <Q>highly objectionable, and that it may prove injurious to the United States;</Q> but, in le&s;s than ten minutes afterwards he falls back into his old &s;tate of torpidity, and really votes for this very "highly objectionable and injurious treaty," without any modification or preamble at all. What an excellent political weather-cock! He tacks with ten times the celerity of the Indian on the top of his Sugar-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the preamble was put, there appeared ac|cording to the counting, or rather mi&s;counting, of the <HI>"Calm Ob&s;erver" Ayes</HI> 49 and <HI>Noes</HI> 49; con|&s;equently, the &s;peaker, Mr. Dayton, was called on for the ca&s;ting vote, and he gave it in the ne|gative.</P>
<P>Thus, another ca&s;ting vote pre&s;erved the honour of the Hou&s;e, as a former one had done that of the nation. But, it mu&s;t be remarked here, that, when the names of the members came to be print|ed, it appeared 50 had voted in the negative; &s;o that there was a majority again&s;t the incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="176" REF="030223_0007_0FE4FE6DC589C538">
preamble, even without the ca&s;ting vote of the Speaker.</P>
<P>Mr. Jekyll, in his account of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act (Woodfall's Reports for 1794; Vol. 4. p. 12) &s;ays: <Q>this act was fir&s;t obtained by &s;omething like a miracle. In one &s;tage, it was carried in the upper Hou&s;e by a &s;ort of <HI>pious fraud:</HI> one of the tellers &s;eeing a very <HI>fat</HI> Lord coming in, and knowing him to be a man of <HI>weight,</HI> count|ed him for <HI>ten.</HI></Q> I &s;hould have thought that, for like rea&s;ons, Mr. Muhlenberg had been count|ed for <HI>two,</HI> had not the error been by &s;ub&s;traction in place of addition. Whether the <HI>fraud</HI> would have been quite &s;o <HI>pious</HI> on this occa&s;ion, as in ob|taining the Act of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> is another thing: yes, Mr. Beckley, that's another thing.</P>
<P>How the Clerk of the Hou&s;e came to mi&s;count, or how his mi&s;counting came to pa&s;s unreproved, when di&s;covered, are que&s;tions well worth a&s;king. Such mi&s;takes are not common; nor is it likely that an extraordinary degree of inattentivene&s;s would prevail at &s;uch an important moment. I do not pretend to dictate to members of Congre&s;s; but, were I one, I would exert my utmo&s;t to di&s;place a Clerk who would dare to mi&s;tate a vote of the Hou&s;e, though that Clerk &s;hould be the very image of <HI>Lord Chalk&s;tone</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Finally, the re&s;olution of Mr. Hillhou&s;e was put, in its original form: <Q>Re&s;olved that the nece&s;&s;ary laws be pa&s;&s;ed for carrying into effect, the trea|ty concluded between His Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States.</Q>&mdash;The <HI>Ayes</HI> and <HI>Noes</HI> were as follows:

<P>The re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed, of cour&s;e, and a commit|tee was appointed to bring in the bills.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that, to know the re|al inclinations of the members, be mu&s;t ob&s;erve, who voted for the call for papers, and who did not. In the pre&s;ent li&s;t of <HI>Ayes,</HI> I have marked in <HI>italicks</HI> tho&s;e members who voted in favour of Mr. Living&s;ton's <HI>paper motion,</HI> that &s;uch as laboured through the heat of the day may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;uch as did not drop in until the eleventh hour.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives who voted on this memora|ble que&s;tion may be divided into three cla&s;&s;es: 1. &s;taunch friends of the Con&s;titution and the treaty; 2. the converts; 3. the hardened political &s;inners.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="030223_0010_0FE52AFAAA3C4568">As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es I &s;hall &s;ay nothing: the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it are &s;o much above all prai&s;e, that I could not hope to do them ju&s;tice. They will find an ample reward in the &s;ucce&s;s of their indefatigable efforts, and in the grateful ac|knowledgements of all their worthy con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s, or the <HI>converts,</HI> merit but lit|tle thanks from any body. Their apologies for &s;hifting &s;ides were, as, indeed, apologies generally are, a mo&s;t mon&s;trous abu&s;e of words. What, for in&s;tance, could be more ridiculous than for a man to get up and make a long harangue, in or|der to per&s;uade <HI>others</HI> to vote again&s;t the treaty, and conclude with &s;aying that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould vote for it?&mdash;And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e he would not create a divi&s;ion between the different branches of the go|vernment! &s;urpri&s;ing! he had voted for forcing the papers out of the Pre&s;ident's hands, he had al&s;o voted for the re&s;olution that was to remain as a prote&s;t again&s;t the Pre&s;ident's refu&s;ing of the&s;e pa|pers, and, at la&s;t, he votes for the treaty in order to cultivate harmony between the different branch|es of the government! the gentleman &s;eems to have fallen out with the other branches, merely to have the plea&s;ure of making it up again. This farce may, then, take the name of a comedy late|ly written by a Citizen of Philadelphia: <Q>the tri|umphs of love; or happy reconciliation.</Q></P>
<P>The fact is, however, this conver&s;ion was not owing to a conciliating di&s;po&s;ition in the converted. Had it not been for the manly, prudent and well-timed mea&s;ures of the Merchants of Philadelphia,
<PB N="180" REF="030223_0011_0FE52B5CB8764110">
this important treaty would have been &s;et a&s;ide.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following memorial was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e on the 17th of April.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Honourable the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States. THE MEMORIAL OF THE SUBSCRIBERS Merchants and Traders of Philadelphia,</HEAD>
<OPENER>Re&s;pectfully Repre&s;ents,</OPENER>
<P>THAT they have waited, with anxious expectation, to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures adopted by your honourable Hou&s;e for carrying into operation the Treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain, and are now &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed lea&s;t tho&s;e mea&s;ures &s;hould be further delayed or entirely omitted.</P>
<P>Under that impre&s;&s;ion, they deem it incumbent on them to repre&s;ent, That the property of the Merchants of the United States, amounting, upon a moderate computation, to more than five millione of dollars, has been taken from them by the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, the re&s;titution of which, they verily believe, depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the com|pletion of the Treaty on our part.</P>
<P>Independent of this immen&s;e &s;um, they have embarked the principal part of their remaining fortunes in ve&s;&s;els and ad|ventures, the &s;afety of which will, as they apprehend, be materially affected by a refu&s;al or neglect on the part of the United States to comply with &s;tipulations &s;o &s;olemnly entered into. Be&s;ides their particular intere&s;ts as Merchants and Traders, they feel an intere&s;t, in common with their fellow citizens of other de&s;criptions, in the pre&s;ervation of Peace, on which the pro&s;perity of this country depends;&mdash;and they &s;hould deem them&s;elves wanting in that &s;pirit and indepen|dence which ought ever to characterize freemen, if they for|bear, on &s;o intere&s;ting on occa&s;ion as the pre&s;ent, to expre&s;s their wi&s;hes and expectations. They, therefore, with all due re&s;pect for the Repre&s;entatives of the People of the United States, beg leave to recommend, that no partial con&s;iderations of policy may influence their deci&s;ion on this important que|&s;tion; but that the Faith, the Honour, and the Intere&s;t of the Nation, may be pre&s;erved by making the nece&s;&s;ary provi|&s;ions for carrying the Treaty into fair and honourable effect.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Nor did the Merchants of the Capitol &s;top here: they ap|pointed a committee to corre&s;pond with other mercantile towns, and with the back counties of Penn&s;ylvania. This mea&s;ure brought &s;uch &s;warms of petitions from the people of property of every quarter of the Union, that the Oppo&s;ition began to per|ceive how little their own &s;trength was.</P></NOTE> However indifferent the converts might be to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of in&s;urance and the general &s;hock given to bu&s;ine&s;s of every kind; however they might af|fect to laugh at the alarmi&s;ts, they would have been afraid to return among their con&s;tituents,
<PB N="181" REF="030223_0012_0FE52B9DEC5A5308">
had they plunged the country into di&s;tre&s;s and con|fu&s;ion. Very probably their turn for roa&s;ting would have come; they might have &s;een their effi|gies dragged about in a dung-cart, with French gold in their hands. Happy might they have thought them&s;elves, if a ju&s;tly enraged people had confined their vengeance to the burning of images and pictures, when the originals were at hand. Their recantation was, in &s;hort, like that of a man who &s;ees the &s;take and the faggots before him. I look upon their &s;upport of government, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, as a &s;ort of verbal conformity with a mental re&s;ervation. Few people are dupes enough to believe them &s;incere. The do&s;e they have &s;wallowed with &s;o many wry faces, has only &s;erved to &s;et their gall in motion: the executive branch of government may expect at their hands every check and impediment that di&s;appointed ma|lice can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>But, little merit as I a&s;cribe to the <HI>converts,</HI> and little hope as as I have of their reformation, I
<PB N="182" REF="030223_0013_0FE52B0492908488">
mu&s;t &s;till prefer them to the hardened &s;inners; for, though a &s;ort of death bed repentance, &s;uch for in&s;tance, as that of the <HI>ca&s;ting voice,</HI> can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to atone for a life of political &s;in, yet it is at any rate, le&s;s offen&s;ive to morality and decency, than to hear the &s;ons of reprobation bla&s;pheming to the la&s;t ga&s;p, and expiring with cur&s;es on their lips.</P>
<P>All the 48 members, found in the oppo&s;ition on the definitive que&s;tion concerning the treaty, will unavoidably meet with the approbation of the French National Convention. They all certainly merit the fraternal hug; but there are &s;ome of them whom it would be unju&s;t to mix promi&s;cuou&s;ly with the common herd: the&s;e ought to have a ki&s;s on both cheeks, while the re&s;t might be put off with a ki&s;s on one; or, if French politene&s;s will in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>double bai&s;es,</HI> to all the five kings might &s;alute the leaders, while the re&s;t might be left to the &s;kinny-lipped blood &s;uckers of the Council of Elders.</P>
<P>In order to regulate the ceremonial, I &s;hall point out tho&s;e whom I think entitled to the di&s;tingui&s;h|ed honour of being &s;lobbered by the five &s;ultans; ob&s;erving, once for all, that I do not wi&s;h to de|preciate the value of any man's labour, or interfere with any bargain that might be previou&s;ly entered into between the parties. The labourer is worthy of his hire, whether he &s;ucceeds in his object or not.</P>
<P>To place the <HI>Italian</HI> at the head of the&s;e wor|thies is an act of ju&s;tice, and an act of ju&s;tice which I have the more plea&s;ure in performing, as I have lately been accu&s;ed (how fal&s;ely every body
<PB N="183" REF="030223_0014_0FE52B26425561B0">
knows) of attempting to &s;ink that gentleman in the opinion of the public.</P>
<P>When the treaty-making power was to be attack|ed; or, in other words, when a breach was to be made in the Con&s;titution, and &s;uch a breach as ne|ver could have been clo&s;ed, the a&s;&s;ailants &s;eemed at a lo&s;s for a leader.

<P>Had SOMERVILLE written his beautiful poem of <HI>The Chace</HI> but ye&s;terday, with the late proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives before his eyes, he could not have made a more apt allu&s;ion than is contained in the above quoted pa&s;&s;age.

<P>After the <HI>Geneve&s;e,</HI> I think we mu&s;t give the pre|cedence to the <HI>Long-man</HI> from New York and the <HI>Short-man</HI> from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t of the&s;e, who labours under an ex|treme poverty of talents, much could not be ex|pected. His head is generally thought to be as empty as his pur&s;e ever was; yet, he certainly &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed all his fellow labourers, except the cunning <HI>Italian.</HI> He &s;et out with <HI>blu&s;hing,</HI> and I leave any one to gue&s;s at the efforts that mu&s;t be made to get a blu&s;h through a &s;kin like his.

mixed with red, and thus deba&s;ed to a vile copper-colour? who would, in &s;hort, &s;uffer him&s;elf to be changed from a guinea to a half-penny? I do not know whether the gentleman has been <HI>accu&s;tomed to &s;uch depreciations</HI> or not; but, if this be the fir&s;t time, &s;uch a &s;acrifice is, in my humble opinion, worthy of a capital compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>I did not intend to trouble the reader with re|marks on any particular pa&s;&s;ages of this gentlemans' &s;peeches: they are generally &s;uch &s;trings of plagiar|i&s;ms, that, to cen&s;ure them, you mu&s;t cen&s;ure their authors, and this is &s;ometimes di&s;agreeable. One pa&s;&s;age or two, however, call for ob&s;ervation; which I am the more ready to be&s;tow on them, as they appear to be original.</P>
<P>The gentleman, in defence of his <HI>paper motion,</HI> told the Hou&s;e, that <Q>it was impo&s;&s;ible to deter|mine that they would not <HI>impeach,</HI> until the pa|pers were &s;een. Facts might then appear, which would render that an unavoidable mea&s;ure which was not now contemplated. If, for in&s;tance, in&s;tead of a treaty with Great Britain, they were now di&s;cu&s;ing one formed with the Porte, where it is the cu&s;tom for Mini&s;ters to give and to re|ceive <HI>pre&s;ents;</HI> and, on the production of the corre&s;pondence, it &s;hould appear that our Mini|&s;ter had received a <HI>douceur</HI> (bribe) on the &s;igna|ture of the treaty; would not the Hou&s;e think them&s;elves obliged to impeach?</Q></P>
<P>This is a &s;uppo&s;ition, wound up with an interro|gation. Now, let us &s;ee if we cannot &s;uppo&s;e and put que&s;tions as well as this <HI>Adonis.</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e, then, that the electors of a certain di&s;trict or city were
<PB N="186" REF="030223_0017_0FE52B068392AC40">
&s;illy enough to choo&s;e, as their repre&s;entative, a man at once proud and poor, haughty and mean, in&s;olent and crawling; &s;uppo&s;e that this man were an in&s;olvent debtor, who had vi&s;ited the in&s;ide of a jail, and who had bilked his creditors by paying them but <HI>three &s;hillings in the pound.</HI> Now, &s;hould a man like this ri&s;e up in Congre&s;s, and, adopting the &s;entiments, the &s;tyle and even the ge&s;ticulations of the mob, ba&s;ely in&s;inuate, that a public Mini&s;ter, of un&s;potted fame, had received a <HI>bribe</HI> from a fo|reign prince; what, I a&s;k, would &s;uch a man de|&s;erve?&mdash;To be cut out, at full length, in a <HI>Living Stone,</HI> and &s;tuck up at the corner of the <HI>Fly-Market,</HI> for the boys to throw rotten eggs at, till the &s;tatue became as yellow as the original.</P>
<P>The gentleman declared (and <HI>very &s;incerely,</HI> with|out doubt) that his &s;uppo&s;ition was by no means applicable to Mr. Jay; and I declare, with equal &s;incerity, that my &s;uppo&s;ition is by no means appli|cable to Mr. Living&s;ton, for who&s;e feelings, as the reader mu&s;t have already perceived, I have a won|derful tenderne&s;s; a tenderne&s;s, indeed, that I would wi&s;h to equal that which he has &s;hown for the feelings of the Pre&s;ident and Mr. Jay.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age that attracts my attention &s;eems to be a &s;ort of &s;ide wind eulogy on the five kings and their mild and humane government. <Q>All Europe &s;ays our <HI>Adonis,</HI> was once free; all Europe, with the <HI>exception of France</HI> and Swit|zerland <HI>are now in chains.</HI> Where then, will hi&s;torical facts be found to ju&s;tify the charge? In the ob&s;equious Parliament of Britain?</Q> &amp;c.&mdash; Poor <HI>Adonis</HI> how little does he know about all Eu|rope!&mdash;and is it po&s;&s;ible that any one, pretending
<PB N="187" REF="030223_0018_0FE52BA8CD776340">
to be a rea&s;onable creature, &s;hould yet talk to us about French liberty? a decree launched forth by their merciful lords, the other day, will give us a pretty correct idea of Frenchmens' freedom. This decree bears: <Q>that the parents of Emigrants &s;hall <HI>now</HI> give up to <HI>the nation</HI> that portion of their property, which <HI>would have fallen,</HI> after their death, to their Emigrant children.</Q> Let any one judge from this, whether the poor devils are <HI>in chains</HI> or not. But, why do I cite particu|lar in&s;tances of their &s;lavery! what occa&s;ion have I here to attempt a contradiction of what every one, even the mo&s;t ignorant of the people, knows to be fal&s;e and ridiculous? "In Turkey, and in Morocco" &s;ays PLYFAIR, <Q>the people know under what de&s;poti&s;m they groan; they know who their rulers are, and they know that whatever inju&s;tice they may be guilty of towards individuals, they mu&s;t have &s;ome regard to the general intere&s;t, to the pre&s;ervation of the whole. They have the &s;atisfaction too of complaining to a friend in &s;e|cret of their misfortunes; but <HI>the mi&s;erable French &s;lave,</HI> who thinks him&s;elf a <HI>free citizen,</HI> does not know who his ma&s;ters are. He dares not com|plain, becau&s;e all around him con&s;ider that their mi&s;eries are the effects of freedom and philo&s;o|phy, and like the Philo&s;opher Panglo&s;s, though ruined and mi&s;erable, they have been taught to &s;ay, that all is as well as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Wretched people among whom every thing is at the di&s;|po&s;ition of a gang of intriguing de&s;pots, who, by means of a printing pre&s;s and reams of A&s;&s;ig|nats, pillage the nation, and excite to ma&s;&s;acre and blood&s;hed.</Q>&mdash;This is the only people in Eu|rope who, our <HI>Adonis</HI> tells us, is not in chains!

is barely honoured with a &s;neer. The people of America have at la&s;t opened their eyes. They have &s;een French liberty &s;eated on her throne, the guil|lotine, &s;urrounded with confi&s;cations, guards, man|acles and dungeons; they have &s;een French religion exhibited in bla&s;phemies again&s;t the Almighty and in the adoration of a common pro&s;titute; they have &s;een French humanity in the form of a child torn from its mothers womb and writing on the point of a bayonet. Yes, and they have &s;een the effects of French gold too, and I can tell you Mr. Living|&s;ton, that they de&s;pi&s;e the corruptor as well as the corrupted. French friend&s;hip they know they do not want, and French enmity is become the object of their contempt.&mdash;To ply them then, Sir, with this old, ridiculous, thread bare tale of French liberty, though it may procure you a <HI>feu de joie</HI> from the hulks at New York, is an in&s;ult to the under&s;tandings of your con&s;tituents, for which I much que&s;tion if even your ignorance will be thought a &s;ufficient apology.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, there is one other nation, be&s;ides the French, who are <HI>not in chains;</HI> the Swi&s;s.&mdash;It is &s;omething &s;ingular that our orator forgot the re|publics of <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Geneva.</HI> They have both the happine&s;s of having the &s;ame kind of free go|vernment as his dear France. Their legi&s;lative and executive branches, and all their offices of &s;tate, excepting the prime mini&s;ter, Citizen Guillo|tine, are the &s;ame.

<P>Never &s;urely was poor youth &s;o di&s;comfitted, &s;couted and routed as he has been during this &s;e&s;|&s;ion. After a months hard labour, the Pre&s;ident refu&s;es him a peep at the papers; he &s;eeks venge|ance, meets a &s;econd rebuff, and is at la&s;t, reduced to the mortification of &s;eeing the &s;chemes of nine long months overturned in a &s;ingle moment, in &s;pite of the counter efforts of his <HI>worthy</HI> relations, at New York, joined to tho&s;e of Chocolate grinder and Serjeant Cl&mdash;ke. In this &s;ituation what is he to do!&mdash;Jog back quietly to daddy's, make the mo&s;t of his per&s;onal charms, ogle the fair &s;ex in place of grinning at General Wa&s;hington, and con|tent him&s;elf with reading billets doux in&s;tead of &s;tate papers. But, for mercy's &s;ake, let him take care how he <HI>blu&s;hes:</HI> "the <HI>bankrupt,</HI>" &s;ays an au|thor "never yet found the fair one kind;" and what then could he expect for a yellow boy who &s;hould blu&s;h him&s;elf to Jer&s;ey copper?</P>

<HI>magnanimity of the king of Spain,</HI> and that of <HI>his own di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s.</HI> Indeed, both &s;ubjects were equally worthy of his &s;mall talk eloquence. The magnanimity of a man, who &s;hakes hands, in an humble peace, with the murderers of the head of his family, is well matched with the di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s of another, who aims at the de&s;truction of his country, or at lea&s;t, of all that is valuable in it, that he may rai&s;e him&s;elf on its ruins.</P>
<P>He told the Hou&s;e, that <Q>he had &s;everal ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, not in&s;ured; that he had landed property in great quantity,</Q> and hence he took occa&s;ion to conclude, that he could not be &s;u&s;pected as wi&s;h|ing to involve the country in a war. This indeed, from a man of moderate views, from a man of mo|derate vanity even, ought to have &s;ome weight; but, from one like the per&s;on here &s;poken of, it ought to have none at all.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men, who as the poet &s;ays, <Q>never are at hearts ea&s;e, while they &s;ee a greater than them&s;elves.</Q> Such is this gentleman. He mu&s;t be every where, and every where at the head; and, as it commonly happens with tho&s;e of his &s;tamp, nature has ab&s;olutely di&s;qualified him for the attainment by fair means.

How has he laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h for him&s;elf the character of a man of learning and ta&s;te! how often and how barefacedly has he conde&s;cended to become his own puff in the common papers! how many letters has he written to di&s;tant places to in&s;ure the in&s;ertion of articles in prai&s;e of him&s;elf! what incredible pains has he taken to procure the

<P>He told the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of his &s;hips and his lands; he might have told them of his <HI>hou&s;e</HI> too, unle&s;s indeed, he looked upon that as unne|ce&s;&s;ary, from its being &s;o perfectly known. This hou&s;e, which re&s;embles in furniture a Dutch virtu|o&s;o's baby hutch, is become a kind of raree&s;how. The vain proprietor acts the part of a de&s;picable &s;howman.

<P>Money however he has, and with this he finds his way into almo&s;t every meeting that bears the name of a <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> a name, by the by, of which mo&s;t men of &s;en&s;e begin to be heartily tired.

But, of all his little baits for admiration and con|&s;equence, none is &s;urely &s;o perfectly ludicrous as his becoming the Mentor of the <HI>little mi&s;&s;es.</HI> That a vain man &s;hould conde&s;cend to cajole the mob, to grea&s;e the hands of the leaders of a club or &s;ociety, that he &s;hould crawl to news-printers, or even run dangling about after &s;pectators to advance his ta&s;ty man&s;ion, is not &s;o very &s;urpri&s;ing: but that he &s;hould &s;o far defy the power of ridicule as to profe&s;s him&s;elf the periodical declaimer at the breakings-up of a boarding &s;chool, and even &s;how an uncommon anxiety to have his &s;peeches on tho&s;e occa&s;ions pub|li&s;hed, is what no mortal could ever have expected, no, not from John Swanwick.</P>

Of a proud man you have &s;ome hold; his pride will not let him &s;toop to &s;uch meanne&s;&s;es, by which alone he can come at the power that makes him formidable; while the vain one will &s;top at nothing. Knowing that the accompli&s;hments of his hopes depends on the people and that it is to numbers he mu&s;t owe his &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;peculates in their errors and their prejudices, and turns them to his own advantage at the expence of the community. No rebu&s;&s;. no ill treatment or di&s;comfit di&s;courages him: kick him out at your front door, and he will come in at the back: drive him from one office of one a&s;|&s;embly, and he will get into another: &s;ome where he will be, where he can make him&s;elf talked of. He is ever the cringing &s;lave of power: he adores it in whatever hands it may be found: as he wheedles a democratic populace, &s;o would he the cruele&s;t de&s;pot on earth; he has not a drop of independent blood in his heart, and he is the mortal enemy of all tho&s;e who have.</P>

Surely this ought to be a le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e, who are to choo&s;e or reject him another time.

<HEAD>PAINE'S AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The</HI> Chri&s;tian Religion teaches men to forego their private intere&s;ts for the &s;ake of doing good, it is not therefore &s;urpri&s;ing, that dei&s;ts and athei&s;ts &s;hould forego their private intere&s;ts for the &s;ake of doing mi&s;chief. Things oppo&s;ite in their nature mu&s;t be expected to be oppo&s;ite in their effects.</P>
<P>The Editor of the <HI>Aurora</HI> of Philadelphia (Mr. Franklin Bache) has adverti&s;ed for &s;ale a &s;econd part of Paine's Age of Rea&s;on, at a <HI>low price.</HI> It is &s;aid, he has received <HI>fifteen thou&s;and</HI> copies of this from Paris, and it is very certain that he &s;ells them at a price which will hardly pay fir&s;t co&s;t and expences.

act of filial piety, or rather filial gratitude, for as to piety I think we may venture to leave it out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This grateful young man &s;hould, however, re|collect that a vender of poi&s;on will not be excu&s;ed merely becau&s;e the compound was kneaded up, or the receipt for it given, by his ance&s;tor. Dei&s;m cannot be well &s;aid to run in the blood, or I &s;hould really be afraid, that the decendant of the illu&s;tri|ous old dei&s;t was contaminated. Charity bids me to hope the contrary, and to a&s;cribe the exce&s;s of his zeal to the amiable motive above mentioned.</P>
<P>It is going too far, perhaps, to &s;ay, that any lo&s;s on the&s;e bla&s;phemous pamphlets is to fall on Mr. Bache, The French republic has ever &s;hown a &s;incere de&s;ire of regenerating us, and as &s;he finds us ob&s;tinate in politics, &s;he may be willing to try her hand in another way. The papers have told us lately, that Mad Tom takes up his lodgings at the Hou&s;e of the American Emba&s;&s;ador; if this &s;e|cond part of the Age of Rea&s;on &s;hould have come to us under his au&s;pices, it is a fact of a curious na|ture indeed.</P>
<P>As to the work it&s;elf, it cannot be better de&s;cri|ed than by &s;aying that it is as &s;tupid and di&s;picable as its author. The wretch has all his life been employed in leading fools a&s;tray from their duty, and, as nothing is more ea&s;y, he has often &s;ucceed|ed. His religion is exactly of a piece with his po|litics; one inculcates the right of revolting again&s;t government, and the other that of revoking again&s;t God. Having &s;ucceeded again&s;t the Lord's anoint|ed (I mean his and our <HI>ci-devant</HI> friend the mo&s;t
<PB N="197" REF="030223_0028_0FE52B6BACD4AF40">
Chri&s;tian king) he turned his impious arms again&s;t the Lord him&s;elf. This proce&s;s is perfectly natu|ral, as has been exemplified in the conduct of others as well as that of Paine.</P>
<P>How Tom came to think of exerci&s;ing his clum|&s;y battered pen upon the Chri&s;tian Religion is what has excited a good deal of curio&s;ity, without ever being well accounted for in this country; notwith|&s;tanding, the circum&s;tances under which a man writes ought to be attended to in forming a judg|ment of his opinions, particularly if tho&s;e opinions are new and extraordinary. For this rea&s;on, I &s;hall endeavour to trace this raggamuffin dei&s;t from A|merica to his Paris dungeon, and to account for his having laid down the dagger of in&s;urrection in order to take up the chalice of irreligion.</P>
<P>Thomas, after having retailed out a good deal of very <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> commonly called <HI>Non&s;en&s;e,</HI> found him&s;elf rather richer than when he began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his &s;econd Part of the Rights of Man, he &s;ays he has a <HI>place</HI> in the State of Delaware. Whether this be a lye or not I cannot tell; but, if it be true, it was certainly the product of the revolution; for every one knows he had nothing before. This was encouragement for him to try his talent in other coun|tries. A confiscated ca&s;tle in France, or &s;ome Abbey where he might join &s;acrilege to robbery, was a &s;ufficient temptation to lead him acro&s;s the ocean.</NOTE> This gave him a &s;mack for revolutions; but find|ing him&s;elf &s;inking fa&s;t into his native mud, and pretty univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed and neglected by the people of this country: finding, in &s;hort, that the Americans were returning to order, and feeling that his element was confu&s;ion, he cro&s;&s;ed the At|lantic to ba&s;k in the rays of the French revolution.</P>

This &s;ecurity was his misfortune, and had nearly co&s;t him a voyage to the South Sea.</P>
<P>From the thief-catchers in England Tom fled, and took his &s;eat among the thieves of Paris. Af|ter having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in execrating the Con&s;titution he had written in defence of, he, and two or three others, &s;et to work and made a new one; quite brand new, without a &s;ingle ounce of old &s;tuff.

<P>This may be looked upon as the happie&s;t part of Tom's life.

ma&s;&s;acre, was a luxurious life indeed! It was, how|ever, a &s;hort life and a merry one: it la&s;ted but five months. The tender-hearted philanthropic murderer, Bri&s;&s;ot, and his faction, fell from the pinnacle of their glory: poor Tom's wares got out of vogue and his carca&s;s got into a dungeon.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful rever&s;e for old Common Sen&s;e. To be hurled, all in a moment, from the tip top of the <HI>Mountain</HI> of the <HI>Grande Convention Nationale</HI> down to the very bottom of a &s;tinking dungeon, was enough to give a &s;hock to his poor un&s;teady brain. But this was not all; he well knew that the national razor was at work, and had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that his days were num|bered. He laid extended on the dirt like a &s;heep or a calf in a &s;laughter-hou&s;e, expecting every mo|ment that the Butcher would come for him.</P>
<P>How Thomas came to e&s;cape is &s;omething that will probably remain a mi&s;tery. It was &s;aid, that <HI>Danton</HI> (the new chief tyrant) &s;pared his life at the reque&s;t of certain Americans; but this is impro|bable, not that &s;ome Americans might be found &s;illy enough to petition for it, but becau&s;e, when his enlargement was afterwards demanded upon the &s;core of his being an American, the ruling tyrants an&s;wered, that he was a <HI>&s;acr&eacute; Anglois,</HI> a d&mdash;nd Engli&s;hman. The fact is, I believe, Dan|ton and his party de&s;pi&s;ed Tom too much to run any ri&s;k of di&s;obliging their friends in Great Bri|tain and America by taking away his worthle&s;s life. Be the motive what it might, he was kept in his cage, and there he wrote the fir&s;t part of his <HI>Age of Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="030223_0031_0FE52B6FA72B5418">Now to the motive that led him to the compo|&s;ition of this bla&s;phemous work; which was no other than that of &s;aving his ugly uncombed head from the guillotine.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that it was under the reign of <HI>Danton</HI> that the Chri&s;tian Religion was aboli&s;hed by a decree. A few days before Tom's impri&s;onment the famous fe&s;tival of Rea&s;on was held. A common &s;trumpet was dre&s;&s;ed up as the <HI>Godde&s;s Rea&s;on,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was guillotined &s;oon after.</NOTE> &s;eated on a throne of turf, and, while incen&s;e was burnt before her altar at &s;ome little di&s;tance, the idolatrous populace, with the Convention at their head, pro&s;trated them&s;elves before her. Not many days before this, the <HI>con&s;ti|tutional</HI> Bi&s;hop of Paris,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> con&s;titutional <HI>clergy means the</HI> new clergy, <HI>the</HI> clergy of the revolution, the apo&s;tates.</NOTE> with his vicars and three rectors, came to the Convention and and ab|dicated their religion, declaring them&s;elves to have been cheats, and that in future they would profe&s;s no other wor&s;hip than that of <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> In &s;hort, <HI>Danton,</HI> and <HI>Robe&s;pierre</HI> (then &s;econd in command) were ince&s;&s;antly occupied in extirpating the &s;mall remains of Chri&s;tianity from the minds of the poor brutified and en&s;laved French. It was a nece&s;&s;ary preparation to the bloody work they intended they &s;hould execute.</P>
<P>Citizen Common Sen&s;e knew this, and therefore it was not wonderful that he &s;hould attempt to &s;oft|en his lot, and prolong, perhaps, his mi&s;erable days, by &s;omething from his pen, calculated at once to flatter their vanity and further their exe|crable views. Thomas had long railed again&s;t the ba&s;ene&s;s of courtiers, but when the moment of tri|al
<PB N="201" REF="030223_0032_0FE52B47B06C8BA0">
came he was found as ba&s;e as the ba&s;e&s;t. The high-minded republican Paine, who had &s;et Lords and Kings at defiance, was glad to bend the knee before a vile low-bred French pettifogger. He de|&s;cended to make u&s;e of the very phra&s;es that the new tyrants had introduced. The Godde&s;s was called <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the church which was profaned by her wor&s;hip was called the <HI>Temple of Rea&s;on,</HI> and the in&s;cription on the banners carried at the fe&s;tival was <HI>"The Age of Rea&s;on"</HI> (Le &s;iecle de la Rai&s;on) the very title of Tom's book. Ba&s;e adulation! adu|lation not to be excu&s;ed even by the &s;ituation in which he was. The old French clergy, with the dagger at their brea&s;ts, &s;corned to purcha&s;e life at &s;uch a price.</P>
<P>I would by no means be under&s;tood as believ|ing that Paine's book was a de&s;ertion of his prin|ciples; for, as I before ob&s;erved, he had been cor|rupted years before. It is the di&s;graceful motive for publi&s;hing his creed that I am expo&s;ing. That it was done to make his court to the tyrants of the day cannot be doubted; for, in all his former works, if he has occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the Chri&s;tian religion, he does it in decent if not re&s;pectful lan|guage. In his Rights of Man, for in&s;tance, he extols toleration, and ob&s;erves, that <HI>all religions are good;</HI> but as &s;oon as he got into his new-fa&s;hioned &s;tudy, a dungeon, he di&s;covered that <HI>they were all bad,</HI> or at lea&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion, and it was of the divers denominations of that religion that he before <HI>pretended</HI> to &s;peak. When he &s;aid, that all religions were good, he was an abominable hypo|crite, or he is one now, when he tells us that the Chri&s;tian Religion is a very bad one. Either he di&s;gui&s;ed his &s;entiments to deceive the Engli&s;h, or he has &s;ince done &s;o to deceive <HI>Danton</HI> and <HI>Robe|&s;pierre.</HI>

Tom knows the value of a character for con&s;i&s;tency too well to run the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing it un|le&s;s upon a pre&s;&s;ing emergency: but, the guillotine was yet red with the blood of his comrades, and he well knew that there was but this one way of keeping his own corrupted &s;treams within his veins.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, by Tom's dei&s;tical Friends, that the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the Age of Rea&s;on was written after his relea&s;ement, and at a time when he was in no danger. Very true; but the die was ca&s;t; the <HI>Fir&s;t Part</HI> was out, and there was no recalling it. He had openly attacked both heaven and earth; he could do no more. One e&s;&s;ay at bla&s;phemy was as good as a thou&s;and for e&s;tabli&s;hing his new pre|ten&s;ions to infamy; but Thomas had now &s;ome|thing el&s;e to attend to be&s;ides his reputation; I mean his belly.

As to political drugs Thomas's were grown out of vogue in France as much as they now are in this country: his con&s;ti|tution was declared to be the mo&s;t &s;tupid perform|ance that ever i&s;&s;ued from a &s;ick brain, and its author fell into di&s;credit as rapidly as he had ri&s;en to fame.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In&s;urrection, revolution, con&s;titution,</HI> a knowledge in all the&s;e &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in a profe&s;&s;or of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> Tom Paine under&s;tood the fir&s;t perfectly well, he had a &s;mattering of the &s;econd, but as to the third he was, and, if alive is, totally ignorant.</NOTE> Among thou&s;ands of others, he experi|enced the &s;udden change in the opinions of the vo|latile Pari&s;ians: from being a &s;ort of demi-god he was become the mo&s;t degraded thing in nature, a

<P>Tom's fate in France was nearly what it had been in America; when it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to employ him he &s;unk into neglect. Happy if he could have cea&s;ed eating when his in&s;urrection ta|lents became u&s;ele&s;s; but as he could not, he mu&s;t continue to write, and as he was in a country where he was permitted to revile none but the Al|mighty, the Almighty he reviled. The pre&s;ent of poi&s;on he has &s;ent to his "fellow citizens" of America, not therefore, &s;o much the work of choice as of nece&s;&s;ity. The Second Part of the Age of Rea&s;on he wrote, for a living and the Fir&s;t Part he wrote for his life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who prefer a few years of life to every thing el&s;e, may find an excu&s;e for this degraded man: it is impo&s;&s;ible for any of us to &s;ay how we &s;hould act at the foot of the guillotine.

<HEAD>FRENCH GENEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>On</HI> the 27th of April la&s;t, there appeared, in the Philadelphia Gazette, an order, &s;aid to be i&s;|&s;ued by the French Convention (I lump the five kings and council of old ones and council of young ones all together) to the commanders of their privateers, concerning the papers of Mr. <HI>Spillard,</HI> the famous traveller. The per&s;on who &s;ends this article to <HI>Mr. Brown,</HI> reque&s;ts him to publi&s;h it, as <Q><HI>it will be acceptable to</HI> every friend of the French na|tion, <HI>and of</HI> u&s;eful di&s;coveries.</Q></P>
<P>Before we &s;ay any thing about the order it&s;elf, we ought to ob&s;erve, that it is publi&s;hed to give
<PB N="209" REF="030223_0040_0FE52B80C5404CA0">
plea&s;ure to the friends of the French, by extolling French <HI>genero&s;ity.</HI> The friends of <HI>u&s;eful di&s;coveries</HI> too are to be obliged, and the paragraphi&s;t &s;eems to hint, that tho&s;e who are friends of the latter mu&s;t be of the former. I mu&s;t allow that the French have made &s;everal <HI>new</HI> di&s;coveries, as, for in&s;tance, forced-loans, a&s;&s;ignats, the maximum, requi&s;itions, revolutionary tribunals, fe&s;tivals to Rea&s;on, drowning boats, &s;hooting <HI>en ma&s;&s;e,</HI> and the renowned guillotine. While <HI>Spillard</HI> has been employed in exploring the back parts of America, the French have been employed in exploring both back and belly parts of the human body: they have been cutting off the brea&s;ts of women and &s;ecrets of men; they have been tearing out the heart from the brea&s;t and the embryo from the womb. The&s;e are certainly di&s;coveries; but, I imagine, the "friends of France" alone will think them "u&s;e|ful" ones.</P>
<P>Now to the <HI>generous</HI> order. After having run on a long while, in the u&s;ual bomba&s;tical cant of the Convention (but with <HI>le&s;s vaunting</HI> than former|ly) the order &s;ays:</P>
<Q><P>As a philo&s;ophical traveller, he knew the chances of war: he knew how <HI>formidable the cou|rage of the French was.</HI> By venturing on &s;ea to reach his country, he undoubtedly puts his con|fidence in the <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> of a <HI>great republic,</HI> found|ed upon the love of <HI>virtue,</HI> the <HI>&s;ciences</HI> and <HI>arts.</HI></P>
<P>No, <HI>Spillard's</HI> hope &s;hall not be in vain, and to have recapitulated here his intere&s;ting labours, is &s;ufficient to be convinced of the readine&s;s of his captors to a&s;&s;i&s;t the views of the government. That is a debt which they will acquit in the name of the republic, a <HI>great le&s;&s;on</HI> which they
<PB N="210" REF="030223_0041_0FE52B1C4D495630">
will give <HI>to our enemies,</HI> and a great claim to the glory which they will acquire; for a <HI>good action</HI> de&s;erves as much as a great victory.</P></Q>
<P>The Convention could not, all at once, leave off their old &s;tyle. We mu&s;t yet be dunned with the <HI>formidablene&s;s of French courage;</HI> and poor <HI>Spil|lard</HI> mu&s;t be called a <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> a name now &s;y|nonymous, with cut-throats. They mu&s;t yet keep up their cant about a <HI>great republic,</HI> and their love of <HI>virtue</HI> and of the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences.</HI> We have, indeed, &s;een &s;ome few in&s;tances of the force of their genius, and of their application, in the <HI>di&s;coveries</HI> above ennumerated; but how long is it, I would be glad to know, &s;ince they have become the pa|trons and protectors of the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences?</HI></P>
<P>I have a book lying before me from which I &s;hall here borrow a &s;act or two. The library at Aney was crammed into hog&s;heads; at Narbonne the books were &s;ent to the Ar&s;enal; at Fontaine le Di|jon the library of the Fuillants was thrown a&s;ide as wa&s;te paper. Many of the libraries of Monks contained editions printed in the fir&s;t days of the art of printing; books, &s;old in France for a few crowns, were &s;old in London for 125 guineas. A clock <HI>en malachite</HI> was &s;old for a trifle, though the only one exi&s;ting. They mutilated or de&s;troyed all the famous &s;tatues, one in particular that co&s;t 200,000 livres. At Pont Mou&s;&s;on, a large picture, which con|noi&s;&s;eurs offered to cover with guineas as its price, was &s;old for le&s;s than two. At Nancy, in the &s;pace of a few hours, they broke and burned to the value of 100,000 crowns in books and pictures. At Lyons 800 antique medals of gold were thrown in|to the crucible. The antiquities of Arles were de|&s;troyed to come at &s;alt-petre.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS. On the poetical Works of <HI>John Swanwick</HI> af Phila|delphia.</HEAD>
<P><HI>In</HI> the la&s;t Cen&s;or I made my readers a &s;ort of half promi&s;e to give them &s;ome account of the poe|tical works of Mr. Swanwick, and I am now pre|paring to fulfil it.</P>
<P>The&s;e works are, as yet, confined to a poem, which is to be found in the Gentleman's Magazine for June, 1795, publi&s;hed by <HI>Sylvanus Urban</HI> of the city of London. The reader will be &s;urpri&s;ed that a poem, written in Philadelphia, &s;hould be export|ed
<PB N="214" REF="030223_0045_0FE52BBFCDA74128">
to England for publication: I was and am yet &s;urpri&s;ed at this; and &s;till more, that <HI>Citizen</HI> Swanwick &s;hould &s;end his works to the editor of a <HI>Gentlemen's</HI> Magazine. He had heard, I pre&s;ume, that this is the repo&s;itory of mo&s;t of the little fugi|tive pieces written by men of learning and genius, and &s;o he conde&s;cended to enrich it with a piece of his own. This was certainly generous in him, if we recollect what a hatred he has for all that is <HI>gentleman-like.</HI></P>
<P>The poem is entitled: <Q>The pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the Fine Arts flouri&s;h in America.</Q>&mdash;After hav|ing &s;poken of the epoch, when the arti&s;ts of Ame|rica &s;hall &s;tay at home <Q>to fini&s;h the glories of the ri&s;en day of Columbia,</Q> our author, by a hap|py tran&s;ition, turns our eyes to what we already po&s;&s;e&s;s:
<Q><L>"But &s;ee what <HI>flow'rets</HI> we already claim,</L>
<L>"What lovely <HI>harbingers</HI> of future fame!</L>
<L>"Behold <HI>philo&s;ophy's</HI> bright temple ri&s;e,</L>
<L>"And fanes to learning every where &s;urpri&s;e;</L>
<L>"What <HI>&s;chemes of charity</HI> the &s;oul excite</L>
<L>"To acts of bounty, and unmix'd delight;</L>
<L>"Some <HI>to the jail with pitying &s;teps repair,</HI></L>
<L>"To mini&s;ter to <HI>woes</HI> that <HI>langui&s;h</HI> there:</L>
<L>"Others <HI>the bed of raging illne&s;s &s;mooth,</HI></L>
<L>"And the wor&s;t pangs of human <HI>&s;orrow &s;ooth.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus, then, <HI>Schemes of charity, Vi&s;iting the Jail,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;tering to the Sick</HI> are, by Mr. Swanwick called "<HI>flow'rets,</HI> the lovely <HI>harbingers</HI> of fame;" and hence are to &s;pring the <HI>fine arts.</HI> Never did I before hear that <HI>poor-hou&s;es, jails</HI> and <HI>&s;ick beds</HI> were places for cultivating or encouraging the <HI>fine arts.</HI> Mr. Swanwick may there practi&s;e fine arts, per|haps,
<PB N="215" REF="030223_0046_0FE52BC45C37F408">
&s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to gain him votes at an election; the&s;e are very fine arts indeed.&mdash;But &s;top, there are more of the&s;e arts to come yet.</P>
<Q><L>"Some to fair freedom <HI>living altars rai&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>"And bid <HI>the negro</HI> celebrate her prai&s;e:</L>
<L>"Others the <HI>farmer</HI> with their cares embrace,</L>
<L>"And pay due homage to his u&s;eful race;</L>
<L>"Some <HI>manufacturers and their arts</HI> protect,</L>
<L>"Others <HI>humane</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments erect.</L>
<L>"But cea&s;e <HI>the Mu&s;e!</HI>&mdash;"</L></Q>
<P>Our poet alludes to the <HI>negro &s;ociety,</HI> or abolition &s;ociety, as it is called; and, I am ready to allow it a place among the harbingers of the fine arts. This &s;ociety is, indeed, a nur&s;ery for &s;ome of the fine&s;t arts ever practi&s;ed either in Europe or Ame|rica. But, how comes our author to number <HI>farm|ing</HI> and <HI>manufacturing</HI> among his fine arts? Plough|ing and grubbing and making anchors and cables, or grinding &s;nuff or boiling up &s;ugar; the&s;e do not &s;eem to me to be <HI>fine</HI> arts. After the&s;e come <HI>"humane e&s;tabli&s;hments;"</HI> and, though the&s;e had been before enumerated, Mr. Swanwick mu&s;t thus &s;um them up together and expre&s;s them over again, for fear we &s;hould imagine that he did not look on them as mere tricks of art. Mercy on us! who ever heard before, that <HI>humane</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments were among the hot-beds of the fine arts!</P>
<P>So much for the vein of ab&s;urdity running through this metre: now to the Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mini&s;tering</HI> to <HI>woes</HI> may be a fine art, but, when we are told that the&s;e woes <HI>langui&s;h,</HI> what are we to think of the fine arti&s;t? to <HI>langui&s;h</HI> is to <HI>pine away,</HI> to <HI>droop,</HI> to <HI>&s;ink under affliction.</HI> Now, can it be &s;aid that a woe <HI>pines</HI> and <HI>droops?</HI> let us change
<PB N="216" REF="030223_0047_0FE52B57CDD65008">
the principle words in this line for &s;uch as are &s;y|nonymous with them, but rather more familiar, and we &s;hall be &s;truck, nay, knocked down with the non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<Q>"To <HI>&s;uccour pains</HI> that <HI>pine</HI> in the jail."</Q>
<P>I could &s;ay &s;omething about the <HI>raging</HI> illne&s;s of <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> and &s;orrow <HI>&s;tretched upon a bed</HI> too, but I ha&s;ten on to the <HI>living altars</HI> of freedom. The poet tells us, that the &s;lave &s;ociety rai&s;e living altars to freedom, and then bid <HI>the negroes</HI> celebrate her prai&s;e. Now, what are the&s;e <HI>living altars?</HI> why, the per&s;ons freed, <HI>the negroes them&s;elves;</HI> and &s;o, the&s;e kind gentlemen bid <HI>the altars prai&s;e the god|de&s;s!</HI>&mdash;They will &s;tand in no need of prie&s;ts at any rate.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>farmer,</HI> I will leave it to the experience and good &s;en&s;e of the reader to deter|mine, whether it be either u&s;ual or fitting to <HI>pay homage</HI> to the race of him <HI>whom we have taken un|der our care and patronage.</HI>&mdash;Our poet often makes u&s;e of figures of rhetoric, but that of the <HI>galimati|as</HI> is the only one he has perfectly at command. It requires neither learning nor ta&s;te to di&s;cover that he has a plentiful lack of both.</P>
<P><HI>Butler,</HI> in remarking on the ver&s;es of the would-be poets of his time, &s;ays they made one line for <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and one for <HI>rhyme.</HI> It is certain that this is a mo&s;t &s;ure mark of &s;terility; but our little man goes a &s;tep further, or rather falls a &s;tep &s;hort, of this: he has one line for <HI>rhyme</HI> and the other for non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This piece of rhyming pro&s;e I do not &s;cruple to pronounce the mo&s;t mi&s;erable attempt at ver&s;ifica|tion,
<PB N="217" REF="030223_0048_0FE52BC2AF047020">
that ever appeared in the Gentleman's Ma|gazine: nor can I per&s;uade my&s;elf that the Editor would ever have admitted it without a <HI>douceur.</HI> It appeared, indeed, to have experienced &s;ome con&s;i|derable delay; for, it is dated in 1788. Certain I am that if old Sylvanus Urban had been acquaint|ed with our little author's principles in politics, he never would have &s;uffered his chiming to enter his repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>Had this been a piece &s;cratched out in a hurry and &s;ent away to the news-paper, one might have winked at its faults, one might have yawned over its in&s;ipidity and thrown it a&s;ide; but here is a &s;tu|died trap for fame; this poor dull mor&s;el had been copied over a hundred times, perhaps, before it was &s;ent all the way to Old England. I think I &s;ee the little poet now, &s;cratching his head and gnawing his pen, telling his fingers and &s;earching his rhyme book. Alas! Mr. Swanwick, people do not make poetry this way. They may hammer out lines 'till they clink, but as to poetry it never was hammered out of a dull brain.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t laughable, is, to hear the little man calling out upon the <HI>Mu&s;e.</HI>&mdash;"But <HI>cea&s;e</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;e!</HI>" as much as to &s;ay that the <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> had in&s;pired the &s;mall-beer ver&s;es we have above extracted! It is with rapture I hear Milton invoke the heavenly Mu&s;e, or Shake&s;pear wi&s;hing for a Mu&s;e of fire; but when, at the end of fifty lines of vapid metre, I hear the little whiffling poeta&s;tor calling on his Mu&s;e to cea&s;e her cour&s;e, a &s;neer contracts the mu&s;cles of my no&s;e, in &s;pite of all my complai&s;ance and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="030223_0049_0FE52B79AD23E0B0">If Mr. Swanwick reckons the noble art, taught by the famous <HI>Martinus Scriblerius,</HI> I mean the <HI>art of &s;inking in poetry;</HI> if he reckons this among the fine arts, I congratulate him on having brought it to perfection, for he has certainly rolled from the very bottommo&s;t &s;tep of the <HI>Bathos.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is to be a pretender to univer&s;al genius without having any genius at all. In&s;tead of get|ting renown a man gets him&s;elf laughed at. It is a real misfortune: Mr. Swanwick might have been happy all his days as a <HI>Tide Waiter;</HI> but, from his dabbling in a variety of <HI>arts</HI> for which he is not calculated, he will mo&s;t probably pre&s;erve through life that character &s;o de&s;picable among partizans; <Q>a <HI>Jack</HI> of all trades and <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of none.</Q></P>

<HEAD>FRENCH FRATERNITY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Since</HI> the autumn of 1793, we have heard talk about little el&s;e than Briti&s;h depredations on the American commerce. Mo&s;t of the news-papers have been crammed with phillipics again&s;t the Bri|ti&s;h government on this account; the nation have been called thieves and their king the great &s;ea-robber. This was not very decent language, but even this was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by certain members of Con|gre&s;s, who &s;eemed to vie with each other in the u&s;e of that &s;ort of rhetoric u&s;ually called <HI>Billings|gate.</HI> I have their &s;peeches now before me, but the extracts I would wi&s;h to give from them are too lengthy, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to mutilate &s;uch elegant compo&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="030223_0050_0FE52B281D437C50">I am the la&s;t on earth that would attempt to ju|&s;tify inju&s;tice, I cannot therefore be thought to ap|prove of the depredations of the Briti&s;h: but, at the &s;ame time I know they have been a thou&s;and times fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, that every art has been made u&s;e of to exaggerate their violences, that the num|ber of ve&s;&s;els taken by them has been counted fifty times over, and that language has been imput|ed to them which they never held.</P>
<P>Nor can the Briti&s;h be ju&s;tified by &s;aying that they have done no more than imitate the French; but, we mu&s;t be permitted to wonder that the de|predations of one nation &s;hould excite &s;uch a live|ly re&s;entment as to pu&s;h the country within a hair's breadth of a war, while equal depredations on the part of France &s;hould excite not the lea&s;t di&s;con|tent, except among the merchants immediately feeling the lo&s;s. At the very moment that the members of Congre&s;s were execrating the &s;ea-rob|bers of Britain, and ordering General Confiscation and Admiral Embargo to take up arms again&s;t them; at this very moment the depredations of our dear, generous, <HI>humane</HI> and <HI>pure fingered</HI> allies had committed greater havock and acts of di&s;hone&s;ty than "the king of pirates" (to u&s;e a legi&s;lative ex|pre&s;&s;ion) or his &s;ubjects, had ever done. I have in another work quoted the report delivered to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives on this &s;ubject, &s;tating <Q>that the French had not only been guilty of <HI>de|predations equal to tho&s;e of</HI> the Briti&s;h, but that they had, be&s;ides, violated the treaty between the two countries, and had, moreover, cheated the American merchants by di&s;charging in de|preciated a&s;&s;ignats a contract which &s;hould have been di&s;charged in coin.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="030223_0051_0FE52B99AA8EFD30">When this report came to be examined, every <HI>uncorrupted</HI> man was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear members fall upon the Briti&s;h tooth and nail, while they were ready to give the <HI>bai&s;es fraternel</HI> to the robb|ing Garmagnoles. One &s;aid that, as to the depre|dations of France, <Q><HI>&s;ome allowance</HI> mu&s;t be made for a <HI>great</HI> nation combatting in the <HI>cau&s;e of li|berty,</HI> and that <HI>he made no doubt</HI> that magnani|mous people would be ready to make every ju&s;t compen&s;ation.</Q> This was the rea&s;oning of tho&s;e times, and &s;o an Envoy was &s;ent to obtain redre&s;s from Britain and which by the treaty is obtain|ed; but &s;ome allowance was made for the <HI>great</HI> nation who was fighting in the cau&s;e of liberty, and therefore all account again&s;t her died away.</P>

<P>Some people will pity and others will laugh at the&s;e memoriali&s;ts; the French republicans will be among the latter. Upon my word, it was very cruel of our dear allies, after having received &s;uch proofs of our "&s;o <HI>decided affection,</HI>" to cheat and in&s;ult us even more than the "great &s;ea-robber"
<PB N="223" REF="030223_0054_0FE52B8A27D328F0">
did I after the patriotic and affectionate captains had run the gauntlet, as it were, to get in to the ports of their dear friends and allies to &s;ave them from &s;tarv|ing, how &s;illy they mu&s;t look to have their cargoes &s;eized, and be them&s;elves thrown into a dungeon! this was often the ca&s;e. I have once before &s;aid, that the Carmagnoles called them, <HI>les capitaines &agrave; coup de b&acirc;ton,</HI> or <HI>caned captains;</HI> ju&s;t as their Con|vention called the Pru&s;&s;ians, <HI>les &s;oldats &agrave; coup de b&acirc;|ton,</HI> or <HI>caned &s;oldiers.</HI> Indeed, they did often kick and beat the&s;e captains, and, though the poet tells us that &s;uch kind of blows wound honour more than any other, yet we have never heard this called a na|tional di&s;grace: on the contrary, the more the&s;e fellows were kicked, the louder did they cry <HI>long live the Republic,</HI> and the more lies did they bring us in her favour.</P>
<P>The hearts of the patriots at home partook of the in&s;en&s;ibility of the backs and po&s;teriors of the gal|lant mariners, and, had it not been for this after-clap memorial of the merchants, the whole would have &s;unk into oblivion.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons of extraordinary patrioti&s;m went &s;o far as to apologize for the conduct of the French; as thus: <Q>The mother country engaged in com|bating de&s;poti&s;m at home, and endeavouring to calm tho&s;e troubles which exi&s;t in her bo&s;om, cannot pay &s;ufficient attention to the filling the offices in the i&s;land with hone&s;t and upright cha|racters, otherwi&s;e they certainly would not &s;uf|fer the conduct pur&s;ued. This is proved by the <HI>honourable and very ample payment for damages and demurage made to Americans detained in their ports.</HI> They are therefore not implicated in the
<PB N="224" REF="030223_0055_0FE52AF7A3A3C398">
charge of depredation.</Q> (See the <HI>Aurora</HI> of 28th. May 1795.)</P>
<P>Now, Great Britain was at war in Europe as well as France was, why then was not the &s;ame apology applicable to her? but, this apologi&s;t &s;ays, that <HI>ample payment was made for damages,</HI> &amp;c. If this be true the memoriali&s;ts are mi&s;taken, for they &s;ay there are <HI>two millions</HI> of dollars yet unpaid in May 1796. I know very well that the French promi&s;ed to pay amply: I recollect that, when Mr. Randolph's report (the &s;ub&s;tance of which I have above noticed) was publi&s;hed, it was accom|panied with a note from his <HI>intimate friend</HI> Fauchet, declaring the readine&s;s of the French Republic to make immediate compen&s;ation. This had the de|&s;ired effect, for, though a &s;ingle farthing will ne|ver be paid, the declaration was looked upon as an acknowledgement of the debt and as a &s;ecurity for the future; while the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, not dar|ing to make a promi&s;e which he was not &s;ure would be fulfilled, was obliged to remain &s;ilent, and his &s;ilence was con&s;idered as a proof that his court not only authorized, but was re&s;olved to continue its depredations. But, how deceitful are appearances! he that promi&s;es every thing pays nothing, and he that promi&s;es nothing pays every thing.</P>
<P>Either the apologi&s;t tells us a fal&s;ehood or the merchants tell us one. I have no great inclination to interfere with the matter: I leave them to &s;ettle it between them&s;elves; or if they &s;hould be obliged to call in an umpire, none is &s;o proper as the dear nation for whom they both have <Q>&s;hown &s;o de|cided an affection.</Q></P>

<P>This intelligence, if true, at once decides the que&s;tion of French influence and corruption; it is therefore of the utmo&s;t importance to form a cor|rect opinion concerning it. Let us fir&s;t &s;ee what claims the letter it&s;elf has to authenticity, and then, whether the alarming information it contains be corroberated by facts already known.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="030223_0058_0FE52B299ECFCD58">The gazette in which this extract fir&s;t appeared is remarkable for its impartiality. The Editor is a man of much experience in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and en|joys a high reputation for candour and under&s;tand|ing. It is not probable that &s;uch a man &s;hould be deceived with re&s;pect the authenticity of the let|ter, and it is &s;till le&s;s probable, that he &s;hould be prevailed on to print it, not believing it authentic. The manner, too, in which he introduces it to the public, &s;eems to me to be a &s;trong proof of his per&s;ua&s;ion, that it would be &s;oon followed up with a more explicit account. Indeed, had he not be|lieved that the whole affair mu&s;t finally come to light, it is hardly credible that he would have haz|arded a piece of intelligence reflecting &s;uch indeli|ble di&s;honour on a portion of his countrymen, and not capable of an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e what|ever.</P>
<P>The Editor has never &s;hown him&s;elf the enemy of France. He has not indeed, like hundreds of others, approved of the ma&s;&s;acres in that country; but the in&s;tant tho&s;e ma&s;&s;acres cea&s;ed, he contri|buted his dole of prai&s;e to the triumphant <HI>moderates.</HI> He was among the fir&s;t to oppo&s;e the principles of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution in France to tho&s;e of our Ja|cobins; and though he was mi&s;taken here, though he was oppo&s;ing mi&s;chief to mi&s;chief, the mi&s;take proves, that the pre&s;ent French government had his appro|bation, and as it &s;till continues the &s;ame it mu&s;t &s;till have that approbation. There is then, no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he would lend his hand to a fabri|cation tending to di&s;credit the French government. In truth, he is over cautious in &s;peaking of it: if the intelligence be true, the harde&s;t terms he has for conduct of &s;uch an infamous and treacherous nature are, <HI>"unkindne&s;s and imprudence."</HI> A man
<PB N="228" REF="030223_0059_0FE52B2B1FC18FF8">
who could &s;o far get the better of the feelings he mu&s;t entertain upon the &s;ight of this intelligence, is rather to be &s;u&s;pected of a partiality for, than again&s;t the French government.</P>
<P>The Editor of the <HI>Minerva</HI> has, 'tis true, been a bold and able defender of the Briti&s;h treaty; he might therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to be anxious for its &s;ucce&s;s, as all men are zealous in a cau&s;e they have decidedly e&s;pou&s;ed; but, this cau&s;e &s;tood no long|er in need of &s;upport when the extract appeared, the treaty having pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives &s;ixteen days before. Had this intelligence been a mere invention to &s;tir the people up again&s;t the oppo&s;ition, or rather again&s;t their de&s;tructrive projects, it &s;hould have made its appearance at the time when petitions were handing about for and again&s;t the treaty. At that time &s;uch a battery might have been opened to good purpo&s;e; but, af|ter the treaty was &s;anctioned, it would have been playing it off upon the defeated and the dead.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is no rea&s;on whatever to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Editor would have publi&s;hed the extract, believing it a fabrication; and as it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be duped by any fabricator, we mu&s;t believe it authentic, e&s;pecially when we &s;ee the intelligence contained in it &s;trongly corroborated by facts already mo&s;t clearly and unequivocally a&s;cer|tained.</P>
<P>It is certain that every American who loves his country, and who con&s;equently feels a deep con|cern for its honour, mu&s;t be fired with indignation upon hearing, that <Q>certain influential men on this &s;ide of the water had invited the French govern|ment
<PB N="229" REF="030223_0060_0FE52B9B2C5E3B08">
to <HI>force</HI> the government of America to &s;et a&s;ide the treaty, and that the French rulers had li&s;tened to the propo&s;al;</Q> but the Editor of the <HI>Minerva</HI> mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I think it rather &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that he &s;hould imagine either one or the other "impo&s;&s;ible." Says he, <Q>it &s;eems impo&s;&s;i|ble that any American citizens could be &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue and duty, as to endeavour to bring upon their country &s;o great an evil, and it &s;eems le&s;s probable, that the government of France &s;hould &s;o far forget our rights as an in|dependant nation, and be &s;o unmindful of the &s;pirit and genius of freedom as to be di&s;po&s;ed to follow the pernicious advice.</Q> Now, the truth is, that what is here repre&s;ented as next to impo&s;|&s;ible is no more than a continuation of what we have been witne&s;&s;es of during four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years.</P>
<P>In order to form a correct opinion as to the pro|bability of the truth of the intelligence from Paris, we mu&s;t go back to the epoch when the ruinous and ruined French nation was fir&s;t <HI>called</HI> a Repub|lic,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>called,</HI> becau&s;e France is no more a Republic in real|lity than Turky or Morocco, or any other de&s;potic &s;tate.</NOTE> and trace down the chain of the machinati|ons of its tyrants to the moment, when the ho&s;tile determination, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of impudence and of perfidy is &s;aid to have been formed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Bri&s;&s;ot</HI> and his colleagues declared war again&s;t Great Britain, Holland and Spain they form|ed the plan of forcing this country to make a com|mon cau&s;e with them. For this purpo&s;e Citizen Genet was &s;ent out to replace Mr. Ternant, bring|ing with him the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions, and the
<PB N="230" REF="030223_0061_0FE52B8BA894CF28">
&s;till more nece&s;&s;ary <HI>rouleaux</HI> of <HI>Louis d'ors.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some time ago, I had a note &s;ent me, giving an account of the depo&s;it as well as the removal of certain <HI>rouleaux,</HI> ac|companied with a poem entitled <Q>the confe&s;&s;ions of <HI>Fran&ccedil;ois Louis d'or.</HI></Q> The author has my thanks for both; but want of room has delayed their publication for the pre&s;ent.</NOTE> As it was fore&s;een that the Executive of the United States would re&s;olutely oppo&s;e the overtures for war, Ge|net was to effect by force what could not be effect|ed by per&s;ua&s;ion. If the government of America was ready to aid the cau&s;e of France it was to be re&s;pected, but if not it was to be de&s;troyed by &s;tirr|ing up the people to oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of coming directly to the &s;eat of government, the Citizen landed at one of the ports the mo&s;t di&s;tant from it, and in a part of the Union the mo&s;t likely to be led a&s;tray by his &s;eductive and &s;editious arts. On his arrival he found a pro|clamation of neutrality, &s;trictly forbidding the peo|ple of the&s;e States to do any thing contrary to their duty as a nation at peace with all the world; but, in place of acknowledging this right of a neutral nation, what did he do? He i&s;&s;ued Letters of Mar|que and military Commi&s;&s;ions: by &s;ea he &s;ent Ame|ricans to crui&s;e on the Briti&s;h, and by land to in|vade the Spani&s;h dominions. His journey through the Southern States was a kind of triumphal pro|ce&s;&s;ion, and he at la&s;t made his public entry at Phi|ladelphia more like a viceroy or a conqueror than a foreign mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>His introductory letter to the Secretary of State was a clear declaration of his inten&s;ions. "When," &s;ay he, <Q>the emi&s;&s;aries of our <HI>common enemies</HI> are making <HI>u&s;ele&s;s efforts</HI> to <HI>neutrali&s;e</HI> the gratitude of your fellow citizens, &amp;c.</Q> This language was
<PB N="231" REF="030223_0062_0FE52BC739460490">
an unequivocal proof that he de&s;pi&s;ed the Pre&s;ident and his proclamation of neutrality, and that he depended on the people for &s;upport. Accordingly his endeavours were all directed towards this one object, exciting di&s;content and di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying one go|vernment by the infernal agency of Jacobin clubs, knew their utility, too well to neglect employing them again&s;t another. The Jacobins had hurled the king of France from his throne, and the De|mocrats might hurl General Wa&s;hington from his chair. It is &s;omething truely &s;ingular, that a cele|brated <HI>atronomer</HI> and a <HI>&s;ecretary of &s;tate</HI> &s;hould be the <HI>pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>&s;ecretary</HI> of the mother-club in each country; it is, however, a fact: <HI>Bailly</HI> and <HI>Dumouriez</HI> once filled tho&s;e honourable po&s;ts in France, as <HI>David Rittenhou&s;e</HI> and <HI>A. J. Dallas</HI> did in the fir&s;t club that was formed in America.</P>
<P>On the plan, and at the recommendation, of the mother-club at Philadelphia, others were formed all over the Union. Their affiliations were as per|fect in their nature as tho&s;e of the Jacobins in France, or of the Reformers in England and Scot|land, and the principles and object of all were the &s;ame. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of their manoeuvres, and di&s;agreeable al&s;o, as it would not fail to bring to mind the conduct of ma|ny per&s;ons who now wi&s;h their folly to be forgotten.</P>
<P>When the Citizen &s;aw that the clubs were be|come numerous, and thought that things were ripe, he made an open avowal of his intentions of <Q>ap|pealing from the Pre&s;ident to the people.</Q> This precipitant avowal, dictated by French vanity, hap|pily di&s;concerted all his plans. The hectoring mi|ni&s;ter

was mi&s;taken; he thought he had the poor dolti&s;h Pari&s;ians to deal with; but he was &s;oon con|vinced of the contrary. The people of America, though their partiality for the French nation, and their &s;till greater partiality for what they <HI>then</HI> ima|gined to be the cau&s;e of freedom, had led them into innumerable fooleries, and di&s;tinctors as unwi&s;e as unju&s;t, &s;howed, when it came to the trial, that they had too much love for their country, and for their friend and father to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of a man who aimed at the de&s;truction of both.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French republicans a&s;&s;ert, with their u&s;ual in&s;olence, that the <HI>people</HI> of this country began to expre&s;s their di&s;like to Genet only when they found he was recalled.

<P>From the moment the in&s;olent Bri&s;&s;otonian found him&s;elf baffled, his myrmidons began to cry havock.

The militia were call|ed out, and the city was &s;truck with terror.

The turbulent mini&s;ter was, indeed, <HI>di&s;placed;</HI> but the manner of doing this fully proves, that it was a matter of expedien|cy and not of choice. His ma&s;ters, and the ma&s;t|ers of unhappy France, could not reject the Pre&s;i|dents' reque&s;t, without di&s;gu&s;ting the people of this country, who mu&s;t have looked on &s;uch a &s;tep as a decided mark of approbation of Genets' in&s;olence; nor could they call home without puni&s;hing him. Therefore, at once to pre&s;erve the good will of the Americans and avoid the puni&s;hment of a man who&s;e conduct they did in reality approve of, they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him from his employment and left him qui|etly among&s;t us, where, be&s;ides, it was po&s;&s;ible for him &s;till to act, though un&s;een, as the &s;how-man behind the canva&s;s gives movement and volubility to his puppets.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If &s;ome good &s;oul would but give us a peep into the di&s;|patches that now and then go over to Long-i&s;land, we &s;hould, perhaps, &s;ee &s;ome more "precious confe&s;&s;ions."</NOTE></P>
<P>Let it be recollected, too, that Genet was di&s;|placed by Robe&s;pierre and his crew, and I leave any one to determine whether the merciful Robe&s;|pierre, the very prince of cut-throats, could di&s;ap|prove of the plans of our Long-i&s;lander. The gentle Robo&s;pierre did, indeed, &s;end us word that it pained his humane and generous &s;oul, to think that the repre&s;entative of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>brave</HI> nation
<PB N="234" REF="030223_0065_0FE52B1DCFE10488">
&s;hould &s;o di&s;obey its will; but we &s;hould have a&s;k|ed this bloody villain, what he would have &s;aid if Genet had &s;ucceeded in his <Q>appeal from the Pre&s;ident to the people.</Q> Genet was di&s;placed becau&s;e he had failed, and not becau&s;e he had at|tempted our de&s;truction. Robe&s;pierre has been aptly termed the <HI>&s;cape-goat</HI> of the Convention, in France, and Genet may with equal aptne&s;s be termed their &s;cape-goat in America.</P>
<P>The in&s;urrection in the We&s;tern Counties of Penn&s;ylvania was undoubtedly a great evil, but much good has been derived from it. This in&s;ur|rection was imputed to the machinations of Great Britain, and as people's ears were all open to every thing, however ab&s;urd, that was advanced again&s;t that nation, it is not wonderful that many very well meaning men marched again&s;t the in&s;urgents with a full expectation of finding them under the com|mand of the Governor of Upper-Canada. This was &s;inning again&s;t conviction certainly; but, what errors will not men plunge into, when blinded by prejudice and pricked on by revenge! mo&s;t peo|ple ware heartily a&s;hamed of having been the dupes of this trick, long before the appearance of Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter; but that truly ine&s;ti|mable e&s;&s;ay on bribery and corruption has placed the whole matter in a fair light, and, as the &s;aying is, "clapped the &s;addle on the right hor&s;e."</P>
<P>Every man who &s;eeks for truth and not for fal&s;e|hood will regret, with me, that we are not in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the famous N^o. 2 and N^o. 6, mentioned in Citizen Fauchet's letter, and of the other di&s;patches preceding that letter. Had we the peru&s;al of the&s;e precious pieces, we might enter into &s;ome detail not having them we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with
<PB N="235" REF="030223_0066_0FE52B35671A6040">
proceeding like mathematicians, from the known to the unknown.</P>
<P>We know, that the &s;ame man, who was Secretary to the fir&s;t Jacobin &s;ociety in this country, and who afterwards denied his report concerning the <Q>ap|peal from the Pre&s;ident to the people;</Q> we know that this man is named, in the intercepted letter, among&s;t the three or four who were balancing to decide on their party, when the overtures for money were made to the French mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>We know, that all the leaders in the in&s;urrection, as well as their partizans here, were then and are now the decided &s;upporters of France in oppo&s;ition to Great Britain. If we look back to the meetings of the in&s;urgent committees, we &s;hall there find the names of two members of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and if we turn to the <HI>yeas</HI> and <HI>nays</HI> of that Hou&s;e, we &s;hall find them both voting again&s;t the Briti&s;h treaty, and oppo&s;ing every mea|&s;ure of the Federal government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I &s;aid, in the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Bone to Gnaw,</HI> that the enemies of Great Britain were invariably the enemies of the Federal Government, the good democrats affected to laugh at me: let them deny this now, if they can. I defy even their impudence to deny the fact.</NOTE></P>
<P>We know, that poor Citizen Fauchet expre&s;&s;ed his &s;evere regret at the failure of the in&s;urrection; and &s;urely we know, that when a man expre&s;&s;es his regret at the failure of an enterprize, it is certain he wi&s;hed it to &s;ucceed. After having ju&s;tified the cau&s;e of the in&s;urgents, and whined out their di&s;comfit, he &s;ays: <Q>Thus will the government acquire &s;tability, <HI>for one complete ce&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t!</HI> Who knows what will be the limits <HI>of this tri|umph!</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="030223_0067_0FE52B7E06373B78">
perhaps advantage will be taken of it to obtain &s;ome laws for <HI>&s;trengthening the government!</HI></Q>&mdash; I was tempted to throw in an <HI>alas,</HI> or two here; nothing el&s;e is wanting to render the pa&s;&s;age truly pathetic; as thus: <Q>My dear Ma&s;ters, in &s;pite of my teeth this government will <HI>la&s;t one &s;e&s;&s;ion longer at lea&s;t! Alas!</HI> who knows what may be the limits of this triumph over our brothers! Per|haps, Oh hell! we &s;hall never be able to knock it down.</Q></P>
<P>Let the reader well remember, that the&s;e dread|ful forebodings of Citizen Fauchet are to be found in a confidential di&s;patch, intended for the peru&s;al of the Convention only. It is from documents like this, and not from public declarations, that we are to judge of the di&s;po&s;itions of a foreign go|vernment. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a letter from the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter had been intercepted, contain|ing expre&s;&s;ions of his regret at the &s;ucce&s;s of the government in quelling the in&s;urrection, and ju&s;ti|fying the conduct of the in&s;urgents. What would then have been &s;een? need I a&s;k this? Poor man! the Lord have mercy upon him, if he had re|mained here after the di&s;covery. Our language is copious, and particularly in terms of execration; but I am mi&s;taken if enough would have been found. Tho&s;e who talk high-dutch would have had an advantage, as it is &s;aid, a man can cur&s;e harder in that language than in any other.</P>
<P>Fauchet was recalled, and, as no mi&s;conduct was imputed to him, he went home you &s;ee. But here is one circum&s;tance that I mu&s;t beg the good reader to attend to, and that is, that Citizen Jo&s;eph was
<PB N="237" REF="030223_0068_0FE52BB29CFD95C8">
called away <HI>after a defeat,</HI> ju&s;t as his renowned pre|dece&s;&s;or was. As &s;oon as it was known in France, that Father Jo&s;eph's fatal di&s;patch had fallen into the hands of the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try, it was perceived that the writer would become odious here; that he would always be &s;u&s;pected by the government, and that his friends would be afraid to tru&s;t their <HI>pre|cious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> to his ear. How kind was it, then, to recall him and &s;end another, whom no mortal man could ever think of &s;u&s;pecting: no, certainly not; it would be hard, indeed, to &s;u&s;pect a third. The mo&s;t unfortunate gamblers reckon with confi|dence upon a good throw out of three.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having &s;tumbled upon the word <HI>Gamblers,</HI> it puts me in mind of the <HI>Farro Banks, Gaming-Tables</HI> and <HI>Gambling Lotteries,</HI> in all about two hundred now in this city. The&s;e noble in&s;titu|tions we owe entirely to the French; and, when we add to the&s;e the pagani&s;h calendar and the Age of Rea&s;on, mu&s;t we not blu&s;h to think that the&s;e generous enlightners of the world are &s;till obliged to cry out on our <HI>ingratitude!</HI> how much better are all tho&s;e pretty things than the na&s;ty broad-cloths and linens we get from tho&s;e &s;ad dogs the Briti&s;h!&mdash;And yet we make a treaty with them! O, fy!</NOTE></P>
<P>The third (and I hope the la&s;t) fair trial of the &s;trength of French influence was, the attempt to &s;et a&s;ide the Briti&s;h Treaty. Here it failed al&s;o; but we are not to conclude that, becau&s;e it failed, it never was made. For my part, I am confident the trial was made, and have not the lea&s;t doubt that it would have &s;ucceeded, had it not been for a <HI>di&s;appointment.</HI></P>
<P>It would be u&s;ele&s;s to repeat here what has been &s;o often &s;aid re&s;pecting the conduct of poor Mr. Randolph, at the time of the ratification, or to go over all the manoeuvres of the partizans of France, from the moment the treaty fir&s;t arrived in the country till the meeting of Congre&s;s. Still le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary

is it to enter into a detailed account of what has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince that time, as it is fre&s;h in every one's memory. One fact, however, I mu&s;t relate here, as it is well worthy of attention.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> for April, page 145, it was re|marked, that <Q>the petition again&s;t the treaty, &s;aid to be &s;igned by fifteen hundred citizens of Philadelphia, was carried round for &s;ignature by a <HI>Frenchman;</HI></Q> to this I have now to add, that, in the State of New Jer&s;ey, two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> went about &s;oliciting &s;ignatures of another petition of the &s;ame import. The per&s;on, who was &s;o obliging as to furni&s;h this information, &s;aw them at a pub|lic hou&s;e pre&s;&s;ing people to &s;ign. He was him&s;elf prevailed on to do &s;o; but, thinking, upon recol|lection, that he had done wrong, he returned to the hou&s;e and &s;cratched out his name. Would to God that numbers of his countrymen were as ready to correct their errors!</P>
<P>After having given this &s;hort &s;ketch of the hi&s;to|ry of French influence down to the time when, as our Paris intelligence &s;tates, it was to break out in|to action, let us compare that intelligence with the &s;ituation of things on this &s;ide of the water. A few &s;entences will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the Paris intelligence is this: <Q>that certain influential men in America had enter|ed into a negociation with the French government, the re&s;ult of which was; France was to oblige the Executive of the United States to abandon the treaty with great Britain, by threatening it with a war in ca&s;e of refu&s;al; but that this pro|ject, the writer believed to be laid a&s;ide <HI>on the</HI> 14th <HI>of February.</HI></Q> On the 24th of March, Mr.
<PB N="239" REF="030223_0070_0FE52BD444DC3F58">
Living&s;ton's motion pa&s;&s;ed by a majority of <HI>twenty five.</HI> This was only 38 days after France had given up the project. On the 28th of April, 35 days la|ter, this <HI>frightful majority</HI> changed into a <HI>minority,</HI> and the treaty pa&s;&s;ed very quietly. This was 63 days after France had given up the project. So that, it is po&s;&s;ible that this might be known when the latter vote was taken, and not when the for|mer one was.</P>
<P>I by no means pretend to &s;ay, that any unfavour|able news from France had an influence on the&s;e votes; on the contrary, I am, alas! (as Citizen Fauchet &s;ays) too well convinced of the purity of the Oppo&s;ition, to &s;uppo&s;e that they, or any of them, could be the <HI>"influential men,"</HI> hinted at in the extract. No, no, God forbid I &s;hould think any &s;uch thing; mercy on us all! they, poor men, changed their votes becau&s;e their con&s;tituents chang|ed their notes. It is the&s;e con&s;tituents who are to blame then, and, of cour&s;e, the <HI>"influential men"</HI> are to be found among them. Now, con&s;tituents are every body, and every body is nobody; and thus you &s;ee, reader, we all of us draw our&s;elves decently out of the &s;crape.</P>
