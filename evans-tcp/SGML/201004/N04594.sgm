<P>And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> be&s;ought the Lord his God, and &s;aid, Lord, why doth thy Wrath wax hot again&s;t thy People, which thou ha&s;t brought forth out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> with great Power, and with a mighty Hand.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;hould the <HI>Egyptians</HI> &s;peak and &s;ay, For Mi&s;chief did he bring them out, to &s;lay them in the Mountains, and to con&s;ume them from the Face of the Earth? Turn from thy fierce Wrath, and repent of this Evil again&s;t thy People.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Excellency of the chri&s;tian Religion is very apparent from it's natural Tendency to promote the Welfare and Happine&s;s of Man|kind. An univer&s;al Conformity to the moral Precepts thereof, wou'd make this now mi&s;erable Earth, a very Heaven
<PB N="6" REF="005706_0004_1026C8D491E25A98">for Plea&s;ure and Delight. All its Le&s;&s;ons are grand and noble, infinitely &s;uperiour to the mo&s;t refined Maxims of an <HI>Epictetus</HI> or a <HI>Seneca.</HI> So yonder Sun outvies the le&s;&s;er Stars, and when it &s;ends forth it's more radiant Beams, they di&s;ap|pear. Numberle&s;s admirable Rules for the Re|gulation of our Conduct in the World, &s;o as to be Ornaments to Society, and Ble&s;&s;ings to our Fellow-Creatures, are &s;cattered in the &s;acred Ora|cles. Among them all, none more worthy of our Notice than tho&s;e which plead for and enjoin a Spirit of Genero&s;ity and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Thus God by the Apo&s;tle commands, Phil. 2.3, 4, 5. <HI>In Lowline&s;s of Mind, let each e&s;teem other better than them&s;elves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man on the Things of others. Let this Mind be in you, which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> When that divine Redeemer cloathed him&s;elf with humane Fle&s;h, Angels proclaim'd the joyful News in that &s;urpri&s;ing Language, <HI>Unto you,</HI> for you, <HI>is born this Day, in the City of</HI> David, <HI>the Saviour, who is the Chri&s;t, the Lord.</HI> Je&s;us was born <HI>for us.</HI> His very Birth was ap|pointed for <HI>our</HI> Benefit. 'Tis al&s;o true, no Man comes into the World for him&s;elf. We are born for God, for the Laws, for our Neighbours, for our Country. No One of us is independant. No One of us has an ab&s;olute and &s;overeign Right over him&s;elf. When we are born, the Laws, the Common-Wealth, our Friends may &s;ay, <HI>To us, for us,</HI> he is born. This is a Truth plainly taught by the Light of Nature. Accordingly, ancient Hi&s;tory informs us of whole Nations who were
<PB N="7" REF="005706_0005_1026C8D769858058">in&s;tructed from their Infancy to look upon the Welfare of their Country as the grand De&s;ign of their Life, and the End of all their Labours; nor did their Tutors fail to teach them, that in Para|di&s;e there were exalted Seats for tho&s;e, who had contributed to the Glory and Grandeur of their Country. Train'd up in &s;uch noble Sentiments, many a brave Soul carried this Virtue of Love to their Country to a &s;ublime Pitch, and thus have immortaliz'd their Names among Mankind. While Time and Days &s;hall endure, the generous and the heroic Part of our Race, will revere the Names of a <HI>Codrus,</HI> a <HI>Camillus,</HI> a <HI>Regulus,</HI> and many others, who greatly &s;acrific'd their Lives for the Good of their Country.</P>
<P>Thanks to the divine Being, Chri&s;tianity is not de&s;titute of Heroes. The &s;acred Oracles furni&s;h us with <HI>In&s;tances</HI> of true Bravery, after having in|&s;tructed us what true Bravery is. There we meet with a <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who&s;e flaming Love to his Country, carried him thro' innumerable Difficul|ties, and has made his Name renowned in the Church of Chri&s;t thro' all Generations. This <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is the Hero, who&s;e Character we are now to lay before you, and in him give you an Exam|ple of a noble Patriot, a true Friend to his Coun|try. Whatever can aggrandi&s;e humane Nature, whatever can add a charming Lu&s;tre to One in a publick Station, is to be found in <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> This we &s;hall now briefly lay before you for your Imi|tation, and to draw forth your Prai&s;es to God who rai&s;es up many, many a <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> even in the&s;e &s;inful Days.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005706_0006_1026C8DA6023E3D8">1. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of &s;trict <HI>Devotion.</HI> His Prayers, oh how frequent, how fervent, how ef|ficacious! Take this One In&s;tance of his prevalent Applications to the God of all Grace. When he &s;ees that the Lord is angry with his People, and ju&s;t going to &s;trike the fatal Blow, his Love to his Country &s;ets him upon praying, and he prays with &s;uch a flaming Zeal, that God repents him of the Evil which he tho't to do unto them. See the Account in our Context, <HI>v.</HI> 7,&mdash;12. What did <HI>Abraham</HI> for that City, which &s;erved as a Place of Refuge for Part of his Family, when God threatens them with utter De&s;truction? His Zeal &s;ets him a praying, and he addre&s;&s;es God in that forcible Language, Gen. 18. <HI>Wilt thou, Lord, de&s;troy the Righteous with the Wicked? Peradven|ture there &s;hall be found in the City, fifty, forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, yea, ten righteous Per|&s;ons, wilt thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">t &s;pare the Place for their Sakes?</HI></P>
<P>In this Devotion we &s;ee a good Patriot. All our Concerns, all our Undertakings, mu&s;t be com|mended to the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, by importu|nate Prayer. Far, far from us be the impious Thought, that we have no need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven in our warlike Engagements, and that our Armies and Fleets are &s;ufficient of them&s;elves for gaining the Victory. 'Tis fal&s;e Heroi&s;m, nay, 'tis Madne&s;s, to tru&s;t in our own Bow, and to &s;ay, that our own Sword &s;hall &s;ave us: Negligent of the mo&s;t High, carele&s;s of engaging his Favour upon our Knees&mdash;Never call him a Friend to his Country, who is not a Man of Prayer, and who delights not in pouring out his Supplications
<PB N="9" REF="005706_0007_1026C8DD2ED11F68">to the Governour of the Univer&s;e for Succe&s;s in every lawful Enterprize. Thy Walls, O <HI>Loui&s;|bourg,</HI> &s;hall &s;tand to the late&s;t Generations [may they &s;tand the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation] an ungain&s;ayable Proof, that the watchful Eye of God's Providence is over the Righteous, and his Ear attentive to their ardent Cries. Infidelity &s;hall &s;top it's Mouth, or humbly acknowledge, that there is a God in the Heavens who hears Prayer, and thro' Je&s;us, the only Mediator, will an&s;wer the Reque&s;ts of his Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man &s;et for <HI>Reformation</HI> To a flaming Devotion, he join'd a Spirit of Amend|ment. When he once went forth to vi&s;it his Brethren, and &s;aw two <HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;infully &s;triving together, he &s;aid to him that did the Wrong, <HI>Wherefore &s;mite&s;t thou thy Follow?</HI> Exod. 2.13. He would fain rectify whatever was ami&s;s among his Countrymen. When <HI>Nehemiah</HI> found the Crimes of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to exceed their Mi&s;eries, he immediately &s;trives to bring about a Reformation. He bani&s;hed from the Land, griping U&s;ury, hor|rid Oppre&s;&s;ion, Prophanation of the Sabbath, and mixt Marriages with the idolatrous Heathen; and by his own Example taught them Charity and Genero&s;ity towards the Poor. What &s;igni|fies it to rend the Heaven with our Cries for Mercy and Help, if we will hold fa&s;t our Iniqui|ties? Has not the God of Truth &s;poken in his Vengeance, &s;aying, <HI>When ye &s;pread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, your Hands
<PB N="10" REF="005706_0008_1026C8E01049E818">are full of Blood,</HI> I&s;ai. 1.15. What &s;igni&s;ies it to rai&s;e Armies and &s;it out Fleets, if they con&s;i&s;t of none but the Vile, Men who are perpetually vomiting out their Bla&s;phemies again&s;t Heaven, and waging open War with the Lord of Ho&s;ts. What &s;ignify Laws of Policy, if the Laws of Vir|tue are trampled under Feet; if God's Sabbaths are violated, if his Name is profaned, if his Reli|gion is flouted at? What &s;ignifies it to enter into Alliances with earthly Princes, if we are not re|conciled to the God of Heaven? In a Word, What &s;ignify good Politicks if we are bad Chri&s;|tians, or Engli&s;h Bravery in our Brea&s;ts, if our Hearts are uncircumcis'd to fear the Lord of Ho&s;ts? The Soldier &s;hould, like <HI>David,</HI> be a Man of God, as well as a Man of War! Soldiers pre|par'd for Death by an anticipated Repentance, will fight with Courage, and meet Dangers with Intrepidity: But, alas, when Soldiers carry about with them a guilty Con&s;cience, when by the Blaze of Cannon they view the eternal Flames of Hell, and &s;ee the Horrors of Damnation &s;ucceeding the Horrors of an Engagement, they u&s;ually fight with Reluctance, and &s;trive to &s;kreen them&s;elves from future Mi&s;ery by flying from pre&s;ent Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of great <HI>Mortification.</HI> The Severities of Fa&s;ting he was well acquainted with. When God cammanded him to &s;anctify the People for the giving forth the Law to them, we read, that he &s;anctify'd them for three Days together, that is, by a &s;olemn Fa&s;t, and an entire Ab&s;tinence even from the lawful Plea&s;ures of
<PB N="11" REF="005706_0009_1026C8E19552D4F0">Life; for, he &s;uffered not an <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> to come near his Con&s;ort during the three Days, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.14, 15. When <HI>E&s;ther</HI> was re&s;olved to &s;acrifice her All, for the Deliverance of her beloved Peo|ple, &s;he gives that Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Mordecai, Go, gather together all the Jews that are pre&s;ent in</HI> Shu&s;han, <HI>and fa&s;t ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three Days, Night nor Day: I al&s;o and my Maidens will fa&s;t likewi&s;e, and &s;o will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law; and if I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h,</HI> E&s;th. 4.16. Far be it from us to abandon our &s;elves to Mirth and Jollity, when the Liberties of our Country are in a totter|ing Condition, and the State is threatned with the Blows of Heaven. Woe, Woe, ten thou&s;and Woes to him, that is not grieved at the Afflictions of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and that can meditate on the dying Groans of the brave Soldier, expiring in the Cau&s;e of Liberty and Virtue, without the Emotions of Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion! The God of Hea|ven &s;hall re&s;ent the Injury, and puni&s;h the Cri|minal with a Vengeance. Attend to his own Words, in I&s;ai. 22.12. <HI>In that Day did the Lord God of Ho&s;ts call to Weeping and to Mourning, and to Baldne&s;s, and to girding with Sackeloth: And behold, Joy and Gladne&s;s, &s;laying Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Fle&s;h and drinking Wine; and ye &s;aid, Let us eat and drink, for To-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of Ho&s;ts, Surely this Iniquity &s;hall not be purged from you till ye die, &s;aith the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</HI> The Zeal of a good Patriot will incline him to join with the &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies of <HI>Zion,</HI> when the
<PB N="12" REF="005706_0010_1026C8E4D22C7F10">Trumpet is blown, a Fa&s;t &s;anctified, and the Prie&s;ts of the Lord addre&s;s him, weeping, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach, that the Heathen &s;hould rule over them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of profound <HI>Prudence.</HI> When he was informed by God, that he mu&s;t go to the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and demand a Permi&s;&s;ion for the I&s;raeliti&s;h Nation to depart his Land, he mode&s;tly declines the Service, from a Fear that he was not equal to it. <HI>Oh my Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;end I pray thee by the Hand of him, whom thou wilt &s;end;</HI> that is, by &s;ome Per&s;on more fit for the Bu&s;ine&s;s than I am, <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.13. And in all his Me&s;&s;ages to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> you &s;ee a Spirit of Prudence and Caution accompanying his whole Carriage: But e&s;pecially, what admirable Prudence, as well as Faith, does he di&s;cover, when to &s;ays to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> upon Notice given him that <HI>Amalek</HI> was come forth to fight again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as in Exod. 17.9. <HI>Chu&s;e us out Men, and go out, fight with</HI> Amalek: <HI>Tomorrow I will &s;tand upon the Top of the Hill with the Rod of God in my Hand.</HI> The &s;ame Spi|rit of Prudence you ob&s;erve in that excellent Go|vernour <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> when his Nation was in great Di&s;tre&s;s. No Language can equal his own Ac|count of his wi&s;e Conduct. <HI>Neh.</HI> 2.12, 13, 15, 16. I aro&s;e <HI>in the Night,</HI> I and &s;ome few Men with me, neither told I any Man what God had put in my Heart to do at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And I went out <HI>by Night,</HI> by the Gate of the Valley, and view'd the Walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which were broken down,
<PB N="13" REF="005706_0011_1026C8E8B10BFFF0">and the Gates thereof which were con&s;umed by Fire. Then I went up <HI>in the Night</HI> by the Brook and viewed the Wall, and turned back and en|tred by the Gate of the Valley, and &s;o returned. And the Rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did. Such Governours, &s;uch Officers de|&s;erve the Good-Wi&s;hes and the Thanks of the whole Commonwealth. They are a rich Pre&s;ent from Heaven. When they are taken away, and Men of an oppo&s;ite Character are put in their Room, 'tis a Token of God's Indignation again&s;t a People. Sad was the Condition, when God &s;aid, as in I&s;ai. 3.12. <HI>As for my People, Children are their Oppre&s;&s;ors, and Women rule over them: Oh my People, they which lead ye cau&s;e ye to err, and de&s;troy the Way of thy Paths.</HI> Wi&s;dom was the fir&s;t Favour which <HI>Solomon</HI> reque&s;ted of Hea|ven when he a&s;cended the Throne, and Wi&s;dom is that Virtue, who&s;e Prai&s;es he has &s;ung in that inimitable Strain, Prov. 8.15, 16. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI> One Way, whereby ancient <HI>Rome</HI> ro&s;e to its &s;u|perior Glory was this: They kept at the utmo&s;t Di&s;tance from fal&s;e Heroi&s;m, in&s;omuch that they equally abhorr'd a ra&s;h Commander as a cowardly One; and they had an in&s;urmountable Aver&s;ion for military Deceit and Tricki&s;hne&s;s, &s;o that when One of their Generals <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> gained a Victory over a <HI>Macedonian</HI> Prince by flattering him with Hopes of a Peace, the Senate judged that he got the
<PB N="14" REF="005706_0012_1026C8EA34087710">Conque&s;t in open Violation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws and Cu&s;toms, which ordain that Conque&s;ts &s;hould be made by Courage and not by Fraud.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of admirable <HI>Watchfulne&s;s.</HI> By means of his wakeful Temper, he was in|comparably well fitted for a publick Station. When he was commanded of God to deliver his Me&s;&s;ages to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> re&s;pecting the Safety of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the Ruin of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Nation, we find that he ro&s;e up <HI>early in the Morning</HI> to do as the Lord had commanded him, <HI>Exod.</HI> 9. An idle, indolent, unactive Man is altogether unfit for a Po&s;t, either in the Magi&s;tracy or the Mini&s;try, the Fleet or the Army. It was an excellent Say|ing of that renowned Monarch <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> That an Emperor ought to die <HI>&s;tanding.</HI> His whole Life was a charming Coment on this Text, and <HI>Rome</HI> was more indebted to him for his Vigilance, than to any other of her Generals. An Officer &s;hould be perpetually upon the Look-Out. The common Rules of Oeconomy mu&s;t &s;ometimes be leap'd over by him. Tho&s;e trifling Regularities, tho&s;e Hours appointed for Sleep, for Meals, for innocent Recreations; he mu&s;t &s;ometimes di&s;re|gard them. Order it &s;elf does &s;ometimes require that a Man &s;hould keep no Order. We &s;ee it in <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> When his Country lay de&s;olate and expo&s;ed, he was indefatigable in his Endeavours for its Welfare. The Drought con&s;um'd him by Day, and the Cold by Night, and his Sleep de|parted from his Eyes. He goes from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Babylon:</HI> From
<PB N="15" REF="005706_0013_1026C8EBB984B758"><HI>Shu&s;han</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Shu|&s;han.</HI> He pa&s;&s;es whole Days and Nights on Hor&s;eback, ever watchful; con&s;tantly devoted to the Welfare of his Country. What a Di&s;grace to a Commander, and what a Mi&s;chief to his Ar|my, when an Enemy enter their Trenches, or invade their Camp, while they are buried in Sleep and Wine.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of &s;teady <HI>Courage.</HI> When he appears in the Character of the General of an Army, or in the Character of a Me&s;&s;enger of God, he gives remarkable Proofs of his Re&s;olution and Valour. The fir&s;t Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> witne&s;&s;es of him, that he was mighty in Words and in Deeds, that is to &s;ay, He was a fine Speaker, and a gal|lant Soldier, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.22. Never did a Mortal &s;hew firmer Courage than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in all the Me&s;|&s;ages which he delivered to that proud, haughty, cruel Monarch, who filled the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Throne in his Day. And as for his Courage in War, if we may believe the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian, he com|manded an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Army again&s;t the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> play'd the Man in the Field, defeated the Enemy, and obtain'd a glorious Conque&s;t over them. Such an one al&s;o was <HI>David,</HI> who in the Day of Battle never fear'd the Face of a Foe; and who in the Court practic'd the heroic Re&s;olution which he took when he a&s;cended the Throne, as record|ed, P&s;al. 101.5, 6. <HI>Who&s;o privily &s;landereth his Neighbour, him will I cut off: Him that hath an high Look and a proud Heart will I not &s;uffer. Mine Eyes &s;hall be upon the Faithful of the Land,
<PB N="16" REF="005706_0014_1026C8F0097CA278">that he may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he &s;hall &s;erve me.</HI> Vain is Prudence, vain is Watchfulne&s;s, where Courage is wanting. By an undaunted Courage it was, that ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> compos'd of three Thou&s;and Inhabitants in the Beginning, pu&s;h'd their Conque&s;ts to the Extremities of the known World, in le&s;s than &s;ix hundred Years. And &s;hall the Di&s;ciples of the Son of God, for whom he has merited eternal Honours in Heaven; &s;hall they flinch, when Cannon roar, and Bullets fly? God forbid.</P>
<P N="7">7. Finally, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Man of perfect <HI>Di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s.</HI> His noble Soul &s;corn'd the trifling Plea&s;ures, Wealth and Dignities which ba&s;e World|lings breathe after and pur&s;ue ince&s;&s;antly. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is the renowned Patriot concerning whom the Apo&s;tle witne&s;&s;es, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.24, 25, 26. that <HI>when he was come to Years, he refu&s;ed to be called the Son of</HI> Pharaoh'<HI>s Daughter; chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on; e&s;teeming the Reproach of Chri&s;t greater Riches than the Trea&s;ures in</HI> Egypt. Nay, &s;o open, &s;o generous, &s;o great was his Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, that when the divine Being made him that Offer, <HI>I will make of Thee a great Nation, if thou wilt let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot again&s;t</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and that I may con&s;ume them;</HI>&mdash;when God try'd him with this Offer, he pa&s;&s;es it over in Silence; but generou&s;ly adds, <HI>Remember</HI> Abraham, I&s;aac <HI>and</HI> I&s;rael <HI>thy Servants, to whom thou &s;ware&s;t by thine own Self, and &s;aid&s;t unto them, I will multiply
<PB N="17" REF="005706_0015_1026C8F42873F118">your Seed as the Stars of Heaven; and all this Land that I have &s;poken of, will I give unto your Seed, and they &s;hall inherit it for ever.</HI> 'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible that a covetous, greedy Man &s;hould be a great Man. A Man that has not a generous Soul, never can fill up any of the Relations of Life in a becoming Manner. What think you of a covetous Father, that is afraid to &s;pend his Ca&s;h in the Education of his Children? What think you of a covetous Son, that won't relieve his a|ged Parents in their decrepid Years? What think you of a covetous Merchant, that will &s;queeze even to Cheating? What think you of a covetous Soldier, that can't be content with his Wages? And what think you of a covetous Officer, that will &s;acrifice his Men of fill his own Pockets? A good Commonwealth's Man mu&s;t have an open Soul. One Step by which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> of Old ro&s;e to that Degree of Splendor &s;o renowned in Hi&s;tory, was their Genero&s;ity; that Virtue which always inclined them to &s;hew Favour to their conquer'd Enemies, and to leave them all the Marks of their ancient Grandeur. We now pa&s;s to the IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>Let us ble&s;s God who rai&s;es up &s;o many worthy Patriots in this our <HI>New-Engli&s;h I&s;rael,</HI> after ha|ving in&s;tructed us in the Road to true Glory. Our Prai&s;es are due to the divine Being, who gives us more Light to know, and Strength to practice the Virtues which con&s;titute real Greatne&s;s, than ever he granted to the ancient Monarchies
<PB N="18" REF="005706_0016_1026C8F5AC035968">of the heathen World. Their Knowledge of them was but &s;uperficial, mixt, confu&s;ed; and as they err'd in Religion, they nece&s;&s;arily err'd in Politicks, many a Time. But thanks to the God of all our Mercies, he has plac'd at the Head of our Councils the mo&s;t perfect Lawgiver that ever held the Reins of Government, even Je&s;us, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords. This divine Legi&s;lator has carried the Ideas of every Virtue to the highe&s;t Pitch: That Genero&s;ity to|wards Enemies, that Contempt of Life, that Ve|neration for noble Exploits, that Scorn of fal&s;e Honour, that Devotedne&s;s to the publick Service, and tho&s;e other Virtues which render Antiquity venerable. The&s;e Virtues we are as well ac|quainted with as any People on Earth; and, God be prai&s;ed, we have &s;een our Land full of Men, who nobly dared to practice them, in the late Times of Danger and Di&s;tre&s;s. How forward have our gallant Country-Men been to &s;erve the Publick! How prodigal of their Lives for the Intere&s;ts of the Commonwealth! Not many Months are pa&s;t, &s;ince we humbled our &s;elves be|fore the Lord, lay low at his Foot&s;tool for our Crimes, and with utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s of Soul, begged his Favour and Protection. Kind Hea|ven lent a favourable Ear to the Reque&s;ts of his People, and has crowned their Fleet and Army with Victory and Succe&s;s. The Great and the Good, the Steady and the Brave, influenc'd by the God from whom de&s;cends every good and perfect Gift, leaped upon the Shore of their Ene|mies, drove them before them, and went on per|forming
<PB N="19" REF="005706_0017_102692B574B2D070">Wonders from Day to Day, 'till they obtained all that generous Engli&s;hmen could de|&s;ire. Wherefore, let us go on to practice the no|ble Virtues of the chri&s;tian Religion. Then will our Happine&s;s be as compleat, as an earthly Hap|pine&s;s may ju&s;tly be expected. The great Jeho|vah has already manife&s;ted the Truth of this; he has proved it to a Demon&s;tration. The Demon|&s;tration is, the Walls of <HI>Loui&s;bourg.</HI> 'Tis true, our Victory is a mingled Victory. In one Part of this Land we view an aged Father mourning over a valiant Son, &s;lain in the Field of Battle: In ano|ther Part, we view a tender Con&s;ort, bewailing the Lo&s;s of a gallant Hu&s;band, that breath'd his Soul into the Arms of Angels in a Trench.&mdash; They died bravely.&mdash;But, ah me, a mingled Vic|tory proves a mingled Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Yet after all, the Victory is our's, the Conque&s;t is our's: And, to you, our generous Hearers, we give Joy in the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> while to God a|lone belongs the Prai&s;e. To him is the Glory due, who led us on from Step to Step, 'till he crowned our brave Troops with Laurels &s;uperior to tho&s;e of an <HI>Alexander</HI> or a <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> To him is the Glory due, who wafted them in Safety over the boi&s;terous Seas. To him is the Glory due, who animated them with a Courage a&s;toni&s;hing to the Beholder, and incredible to the Hearer. To him is the Glory due, who &s;afeguarded them from Harms, when every Ear was deafned with the Noi&s;e of Cannon, and every Eye intent on Bombs blazing in the Air. To him is the Glory due, who led them victorious into the almo&s;t impreg|nable
<PB N="20" REF="005706_0018_1026C8FCC4C5C958">Fortre&s;s of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> and has there lodg'd them &s;afe from all Annoyance. Let then every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Heart rejoice in God our Saviour, and give thanks at the Remembrance of his miraculous Goodne&s;s. But, is it only the Calves of our Lips that we are to offer to our kind Benefactor? Shall we think it &s;ufficient, that our Tongue proclaim his Bounty? No, there is the Tribute of an holy Life due unto him; a Life devoted to his Honour; a Life &s;pent in a &s;tudious Conformity to his holy Will, and in the Promotion of his Kingdom a|mong Mankind. If &s;uch a Life be not hencefor|ward found with us, the Walls of <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> &s;hall te&s;tify again&s;t us, and proclaim our Ingratitude to all the Earth; Ingratitude, the ba&s;e&s;t of Vices, the blacke&s;t of Crimes. Every Stone &s;hall have a Voice, and cry aloud, &s;aying, Did not the God hearing Prayer, lend a gracious Ear to all your Reque&s;ts, and grant the Petitions which you were con&s;cious included nothing le&s;s than Miracles? And do you thus requite the Lord, O fooli&s;h Peo|ple and unwi&s;e? Well then, from this Day, Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be practis'd by us, manly Vir|tue &s;hall adorn our Conver&s;ation, and every one merit the Character of a &s;teady Patriot and a chri&s;|tian Hero. Thus &s;hall we go on cheerful in the Road which leads to the unfading Honours and the immortal Glories of the heavenly World; into which God grant us e'er long an open Admi&s;&s;ion, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord and Saviour, to whom be a&s;cribed the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, henceforth and forevermore, <HI>Amen</HI> and</P>
