<HEAD>A Plain NARRATIVE &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INASMUCH as the Reverend <HI>Theophilus Pickering</HI> has publi&s;hed and recommended to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of his Readers, a Narrative of the Ordination of the Reverend <HI>John Cleaveland,</HI> over a new-gathered Church in <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of aggrieved Brethren, heretofore Members of his Church, without exhibiting what pa&s;s'd previous to this Event; it appears nece&s;&s;ary in order to a right Judgment, that this Defect in his Hi&s;tory be &s;upply'd: Hereupon we believe the Judicious and Impartial will not think quite &s;o ill of us as Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> would have them; and all will be better able to judge of the Effect, when they know the Cau&s;e that produced it; and hereby it will al&s;o appear who are mo&s;t to blame, Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> and Adhe|rents, who &s;o evilly entreated us for &s;o many Years together, or we who by this Treatment were drove to this Pa&s;s. It will al&s;o appear by this Narrative what Churches be&s;t an&s;wered the Chri&s;tian Character, tho&s;e that &s;at &s;till the Spectators of our Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or tho&s;e that appeared for our Relief in the Manner by him complained of.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to the Relation of Facts, we would premi&s;e a few Things, and offer them to the Con&s;ideration of the Reader.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As all Covenants, &s;o Church-Covenants, &s;uppo&s;e two Parties, each of which have &s;omething to perform as a Condition dependant on each other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In Church-Covenants, the Privileges and Advantages, as the Word, Sacraments, Di&s;cipline &amp;c. agreable to the Go&s;pel, are always pre&s;uppo&s;ed, and to be regarded as the Inducements with the Per&s;on that joins with a Church; who therefore puts him&s;elf under their Watch and Government; which they promi&s;e and engage: But if this be neglected by the Church, then that Co|venant is by them vertually di&s;&s;olved, and the Party injured, in Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice (if not in Form) at Liberty from his Obligation to that Church. Hence,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In Ca&s;e it &s;o happen, thro' the Art and Subtilty of the Pa&s;tor being him|&s;elf involved; or the implicit Obedience of a major Part of his Church, to his Dictates and De&s;igns; or from what Cau&s;e &s;oever; that the Way to a declared and formal Di&s;&s;olution of &s;aid Covenant, or the Relation of a Member, di&s;ap|pointed in his Expectations as afore&s;aid, is blocked up, and his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion or Relief not to be obtained in a Way of Order. Then, we &s;ay in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, it is lawful, at lea&s;t excu&s;able; to be &s;ure, not an&s;werable to the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or, for &s;uch a di&s;appointed and injured Member, to &s;eek Relief in a Way extra|judicial,
<PB N="4" REF="005920_0003_10292AC5D99D4040">&s;ince the main Thing in Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> The Edification of the Per&s;on can't be obtained otherwi&s;e. And to this all Forms however u&s;eful, mu&s;t tive Way; and hence whatever Injury is thereby done to the Order of the Churches, mu&s;t in Ju&s;tice and Equity fall on tho&s;e that were the Aggre&s;&s;ors, and had de|&s;troy'd the Thing in Effect: And for &s;uch to plead a Right over Members &s;o u&s;ed and &s;o relieved, or that talk of cen&s;uring Churches, who have afforded their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; do by a ju&s;t Con&s;truction declare they have a Right to hold tho&s;e Members only for to abu&s;e them; and every Church that will be &s;o hardy as to interrupt their De&s;ign, &s;hall be &s;ure to &s;mart for it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If this Neglect of a Church or Pa&s;tor has been continued for &s;uch a Length of Time, as in Rea&s;on to wear out the Patience and Spirits of the Sufferers, and produce an utter and total De&s;pair of future Advantage by continuing together, and thereupon a Separation be produced (or may we not &s;ay <HI>extorted</HI>) then the Trial of the Ca&s;e mu&s;t be by what happened before this Event, and not by what the Church might afterwards do; which, whatever it is, might be done, only from politick Views, to bring an Odium upon a Tran&s;action that they would not before u&s;e Means to prevent. And it appears unrea&s;onable to condemn one Man for acting incongruous to the Mind of another, when his Mind in that Matter was not known, 'till that Act was perpetrated.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thus having premi&s;ed or laid down the&s;e few Principles, we proceed to &s;hew by a Relation of Facts, and by an&s;wering a few Que&s;tions, how far our Ca&s;e corre&s;ponds with and may be &s;upported by them.</P>
<P>In the Year 1741 and onwards, it plea&s;ed God out of his infinitely rich free and fovereign Grace to bring upon the Minds of many in this Pari&s;h, a deep Concern about their future E&s;tate, and <HI>what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved:</HI> And al|tho' &s;omething of this Concern then &s;pread it&s;elf over the Land, and in &s;ome Places was very remarkable, we believe it was in none more &s;o than in this Place, where before we were as carele&s;s, worldly, and &s;ecure as any, if not more &s;o. But now the Face of Things was changed: <HI>An Engagedne&s;s to hear the Word preached; Chri&s;tian Conferences; private Meetings for religious Wor|&s;hip; and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other in a Way of Life;</HI> were what the Minds of many appeared to be deeply concerned in, and engro&s;s'd much of our Time: And we have undoubted Grounds to conclude (at this Time) the free Grace of God was richly di&s;played in the &s;aving Conver&s;ion of many to God, among us: God's Grace be magnified therefor! At the fir&s;t Appearance of the&s;e Things Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> &s;eem'd very re&s;erv'd and cautious how he gave us Encourage|ment; however, we had Hopes he would &s;oon &s;ee it to be his Duty to fall in with what we were firmly per&s;waded, was from the Spirit of Chri&s;t. But we pre&s;ently found our Mi&s;take, and that we were to expect little &s;pecial A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Encouragement from him: For, excepting that for two or three Months he allowed us to have occa&s;ional Preaching from others under certain Re&s;trictions; and that he would hold his own Lectures more frequently (which he drop'd again after one or two Sermons) we don't remember any Thing that he did to encourage or a&s;&s;i&s;t us; or that he adapted his Preaching any otherwi&s;e to the times (as we apprehend) than by taking Advantage of the Failings that attend|ed, to blacken and di&s;parage the whole: Nor do we believe he will &s;ay, that he
<PB N="5" REF="005920_0004_10292AF8D9694790">once clo&s;ely conver&s;ed with any one Per&s;on under Soul-Concern, when &s;ought unto for that Purpo&s;e; or that he once attended a private Meeting, whereby to a&s;&s;i&s;t and guide their Minds and Devotion in a Way of Truth; and to prevent tho&s;e Mi&s;takes in both he &s;o often complained of: Nor will he &s;ay on the con|trary, that he forbore to treat both the Operations and the Subjects of them with a general Slight &amp; Contempt; once he &s;aid, we were led by a devili&s;h Spirit; which we apprehended was in a Manner unbecoming a Mini&s;ter to treat any Thing that had but the Appearance of Religion; to be &s;ure in a Manner extream|ly offen&s;ive and grievous to tender Minds.</P>
<P>This Carriage, together with his <HI>old Way of Preaching</HI> (which now was be|come very <HI>un&s;avoury</HI> to us) caus'd great Unea&s;ine&s;s. Some of us often apply'd to him for Redre&s;s, but in vain; for he &s;oon refu&s;ed to treat with us otherwi&s;e than by Writing; to which we were loth, knowing he had a Faculty to be critical; and thinking him di&s;po&s;ed to take the Advantage his Learning &amp; Parts gave him over us. But at length finding the Cau&s;e of our Offence increa&s;ing, and <HI>no Hope</HI> of Relief, but by the Church, before which we &s;uppo&s;ed the Ca&s;e in this Way would &s;oon come; therefore on the 12th of <HI>March</HI> 1744, we exhibited a Paper to him, containing <HI>fourteen</HI> Articles of Grievance, re&s;pecting his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> &s;igned by twenty &s;ix of the Church, out of &s;ixty three, as we think the Number was: Hereupon we &s;oon received his An&s;wer in Wri|ting to &s;ome of the Articles of Charge, with a De&s;ire that we would explain our &s;elves on the other: Whereupon we pre&s;ently explained tho&s;e he de&s;ired, and as we tho't fully replied to what he had &s;aid, in An&s;wer to us; concluding with this Po&s;t&s;cript, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Thus, <HI>Rev. Sir,</HI> we have examined your An&s;wer to our Complaints, by which you will &s;ee how far you come &s;hort in giving us Sa|tisfaction; we pray you to con&s;ider and duly weigh this our Reply, and our Complaints in this and our former Paper: And pray Sir, Do this with Can|dor and a Chri&s;tian Spirit; and after &s;ome waiting we &s;hall attend you in Per&s;on to know your Re&s;ult: but &s;hall expect a free Conver&s;ation, and no penning of Words, nor taking Advantage on either Side: If you are con|vinced, and give us rea&s;onable Satisfaction, all will be well; otherwi&s;e we may then propo&s;e to you &s;ome other Method for obtaining Relief; for we propo&s;e not to follow you farther by way of Writing. <HI>April</HI> 10.1744.</Q></P>
<P>To this we received his of <HI>April</HI> 16, in which was the following Pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>You &s;ignify your Intention to come and know my Re&s;ult (and have a free Conver&s;ation with me without penning of Words or taking Advantage) to this I &s;ay, if you mean to &s;hew me Re&s;pect, I am much obliged to you; but I apprehend the Method you propo&s;e, is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor &s;afe.</Q></P>
<P>This Denial (as we took it) of a free Conference, occa&s;ion'd farther writing. The Relation of which we mu&s;t at pre&s;ent leave, while we &s;tep back, and re|late a new Matter of Offence that had ari&s;en, which we were controverting be|tween us; the Thing was this, <HI>viz.</HI> On the 11th of <HI>March,</HI> the Day before our afore&s;aid Articles of Charge were deliver'd; as Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> was preaching his afternoon Sermon, he had this Expre&s;&s;ion, viz. <HI>That none know the Actings of Faith, but God only;</HI> or to that Purpo&s;e: After Sermon, one of the Hearers meekly de&s;ired him to explain him&s;elf thereon, for that he was di&s;&s;atisfied with the Expre&s;&s;ion; to this others joined al&s;o; but he declin'd an&s;wering the Que&s;tion, or explaining the A&s;&s;ertion, and declared, he was not afraid of <HI>di&s;obliging a
<PB N="6" REF="005920_0005_10292AC88D20BF90">Friend,</HI> or <HI>of lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h;</HI> as he remember'd his own Words; but as we under&s;tood him, his Words were, <HI>He did not value di&s;obliging a Friend, or lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;aw we could not then be re&s;olved, we propo&s;ed to wait on him at his Hou&s;e, for his Solution; and accordingly the next Day we waited on him for that Purpo&s;e; but it &s;eem'd he had heard, his Words about lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h, were under&s;tood by &s;ome others as we took them; and that his Party did not like the Slight, they imported; hereupon, he at once refus'd to confer with us, on the &s;aid A&s;&s;ertion, otherwi&s;e than by writing; and in a Mood not the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, demanded of us, how he expre&s;s'd h0im&s;elf, the Day before with Re&s;pect to <HI>lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h?</HI> Three or four of us an&s;wered, we under&s;tood him to &s;ay, <HI>He did not value &amp;c.</HI> This An&s;wer he immediately penned down, and then de|manded, Who el&s;e dare &s;ay &s;o? But others &s;u&s;pecting his De&s;ign, held their Peace. Finding we were to expect Satisfaction in Nothing from him, we delivered him our Articles of Complaint before mentioned, and then withdrew: The &s;ame Day came forth from Mr. <HI>Pickering,</HI> the following Citation or Impeachment, in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas you came to my Hou&s;e this Afternoon, with my Neighbours <HI>David Low,</HI> Jun. <HI>Solomon Andrews, Robert Burnum, Daniel Giddinge, Thomas Giddinge, Benjamin Cra&s;t, Eleazer Craft, Thomas Jones,</HI> and <HI>William Allen;</HI> and in Di&s;cour&s;e concerning &s;ome Words by me &s;poken Ye&s;terday in the publick A&s;&s;embly; which were occa&s;ion'd by the Interruption then given me by <HI>Daniel Giddinge</HI> afore&s;aid; and in Way of Reply, did declare in the Pre&s;ence of my Neighbours above-named, that I told the People Ye&s;terday, That I did not <HI>value lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h:</HI> And whereas I made An&s;|wer to you, that what I then &s;aid, was, <HI>That what I was per&s;waded to be the Truth, I &s;hould &s;tand by, and was not afraid of lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h, or di&s;obliging a Friend;</HI> which Expre&s;&s;ion I earne&s;ly affirmed; and reminded you, what high Profe&s;&s;ion you made of the Fear and Love of God: I a&s;ked you, what you thought I mu&s;t needs think of you; but &s;till you per&s;i&s;ted in your Say, and &s;everally a&s;&s;erted without any <HI>I&s;s</HI> or <HI>Ands,</HI> that what I &s;aid was, That I did not <HI>value lo&s;ing a Pari&s;h;</HI> and tho' I de&s;ired the Neighbours pre&s;ten to take Notice of your Words, yet you left the Matter under the Circum&s;tan|ces before recited: Wherefore knowing your A&s;&s;ertion afore&s;aid to be an ab&s;olute and pernicious Fal&s;hood, contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, and tending to my great Damage and Defamation: As al&s;o con&s;idering the State of the Church and Pari&s;h, and the Circum&s;tances of the Times: The&s;e are to inform you, that I am di&s;po&s;ed to take &s;uch Mea|&s;ures as may oblige you to an&s;wer for your Offence at the next Court of Ge|neral Se&s;tions of the Peace to be holden in and for the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> un|le&s;s you make a &s;atisfactory Acknowledgement, with Promi&s;e of behaving well for the future; and al&s;o give me &s;ufficient Security to re&s;pond all Da|mages, which in Con&s;equence of your Conduct may in any wi&s;e accrue to me.</P>

This <HI>Piece</HI> he &s;ent out by that &s;ame <HI>Titus,</HI> his Servant, whom he tells the Pub|lick in his <HI>bad Omen</HI> he &s;ent hither and thither, about the Time of the &s;aid Ordi|nation; but as we could not think him in earne&s;t, or it he was, that we &s;hould fail to prove the Point upon him; al&s;o in Regard he had quite &s;lipt off from the main Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> our Di&s;&s;atisfaction at his A&s;&s;ertion in his Preaching, and his pretended Interruption thereon, and had laid out all his Concern upon &s;ome Di&s;advantage be had given his temporal Intere&s;t; con&s;idering al&s;o the Severity of his Terms, we pay'd no Obedience to the Citation, nor gave Bonds of In|demnification, as was demanded.</P>
<P>However, according to his Threatning, when the <HI>Court</HI> &s;at, he laid the Mat|ter before the Grand-Jurors; but upon our producing a Number of Evidences to prove his Words to be as we had alledged; he &s;aw good to drop that Matter: however that he might not fail to do us a Di&s;plea&s;ure, laid before the Grand-Jurors the Interruption con&s;i&s;ting in our &s;peaking in the Meeting-Hou&s;e as before related; and with two Days worry or Fatigue obtained of the Jury, to find a Bill again&s;t <HI>three</HI> of us, for a&s;king the Solution afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>At this Proceeding People grew more generally offended, which might be the Occa&s;ion, that Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> cau&s;ed the Church to meet on the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> about a Month after he had procured the pre&s;entments, to acquaint them, as it appears by his Minutes, with the Difficulties that had ari&s;en; and &s;eem'd to be di&s;pos'd to read the whole of our Papers to the Church; which we al&s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, to accommodate Matters among our &s;elves: but it &s;top'd in the Intimation, and nothing was done, excepting that he read the Paper of Charges, omitting what had been written thereon; he at the &s;ame Time &s;aid much to ju&s;tify his pro&s;ecuting us in the Law; however he told us, if we ma|nife&s;ted a Sen&s;e of our Mi&s;conduct, he &s;hould rejoyce at it, and endeavour to &s;erve us at the Court then coming on: And to &s;hew how far we were to depend upon his good Di&s;po&s;ition towards us, he then recall'd the Liberty he had given us of having the preaching of others among&s;t us, which was the only Favour he had ever heretofore granted unto us; remarking at the &s;ame Time his giving that Liberty, was an Error in him, for which he a&s;ked Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Whereupon when we &s;aw what his fair Pretence of a Pacification was like to come to, we delivered him a Paper of Complaints in eight Particulars, chiefly on his pro&s;ecuting us in the Law, and for refu&s;ing to explain the afore&s;aid A&s;&s;er|tion; and another Paper containing an An&s;wer to his of the 5th of <HI>April</HI> 1744. The fir&s;t of the&s;e he read to the Church, and then di&s;&s;olv'd the Meeting with|out any Vote.</P>
<P>Soon after this, our Trial come on, and we were acquited, paying Co&s;t. On <HI>May</HI> 7. 1744, we received Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI>'s An&s;wer to our la&s;t mentioned Pa|per of Complaints, ju&s;tifying the Matter of the Pro&s;ecution, but making &s;ome Confe&s;&s;ion as to the Manner of his Proceeding: in this Paper al&s;o explain'd his &s;aid A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Meaning was that none knew the Actings of Faith in another, but God him&s;elf. And if this was indeed his Meaning, he might in a few Words at fir&s;t have told us &s;o, and thereby prevented all the Mi&s;chief and Offence that aro&s;e thereon, but he was not &s;o di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>On <HI>May</HI> 18. 1744, we &s;ent him a Reply to his &s;aid An&s;wer, &s;hewing that it was the Matter of the Pro&s;ecution, as well as the Manner of it, that was offen|&s;ive
<PB N="8" REF="005920_0007_10292ACA1086CA08">and unju&s;ti&s;iable: We al&s;o &s;ent him a &s;hort Paper in Reply to one we re|ceiv'd from him, upon our other Articles of Complaint; in both which we &s;trongly urged him to call the Church together, and lay our Ca&s;e before them, for their Judgment thereon. On the 30th of <HI>May</HI> following, we had another Paper from Mr. <HI>Pickering,</HI> in&s;i&s;ting on his Ju&s;tification, with a plain Denial to grant us a Church-meeting, for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>But to do Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> Ju&s;tice, he offered on Sight of an atte&s;ted Copy of the Bill of Co&s;t (from the Clerk of the Court) to repay us, if de&s;ired; tho', as he &s;aid, it was not agreable to Equity; but as our Concern chiefly was about his untender, and as we thought, unchri&s;tian Method of Proceeding with us, (which &s;till he laboured to ju&s;tify) we let this go, with a great Deal more, it had co&s;t us, which he did not propo&s;e to repay, as a &s;mall Thing, in Compari&s;on of other Things.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 28th we &s;ent him a Paper &s;igned by thirty-five of the Church reque&s;ting a Church meeting, to con&s;ider of our Affairs: On the 29th we received a &s;hort Paper from him, glo&s;&s;ing on one or two of our former Papers, and denying us a Church-meeting, on Pretence we had left his Communion, which &s;ome of us had done upon his pro&s;ecuting us in the Law as afore&s;aid (at which we believe the World will not wonder or judge us ra&s;h in &s;o doing; &s;ince 'till then under all our Abu&s;es and Neglects we had not left it:) he therein in&s;i&s;ted we had no Right to expect the Church to act upon our Affairs.</P>
<P>Thus unhappy were we; our Pa&s;tor had for &s;ome Years treated us (as we apprehended) with Cruelty, and our Church with Neglect, whereby our Con&s;|ciences were &s;o offended as that, we could not in Charity and Love commune with them; and then this mu&s;t be con&s;trued as cutting our &s;elves off from all Right to a Church-meeting for our Help! What could Men do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Rea&s;on and Denial, or our reque&s;ting again, a Church-meeting was held: All our Papers were read, but nothing was done thereon. At this Meeting we propo&s;ed three Things to the Church, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) Either that they would pa&s;s their Judgment on our Cau&s;e, or let us know their Mind about it? or el&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) That they would join with us in Council. And if they would do neither of the&s;e,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) That they would di&s;mi&s;s us to &s;ome other Church, or to embody into Church-State by our &s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST>
But Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> did not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed, that the Church &s;hould act on our Affairs at all, and by the Chur|ches accu&s;tomed Silence they were willing he &s;hould have his Way; &s;o the Meeting ended, and they did neither.</P>
<P>On the 14th of <HI>September</HI> following we &s;igned and &s;ent him another Reque&s;t for a Church-meeting; but on the 18th were deny'd in &s;uch Terms and Princi|ples in An&s;wer from him, as gave us to conclude he never would &s;uffer the Church to act upon our Affairs; therefore on the 21&s;t we &s;ub&s;cribed and &s;ent him the following Paper, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<PB N="9" REF="005920_0008_10292AFFB13A8A00">Charges be never &s;o high and ju&s;t; and the Church never &s;o much rent with Divi&s;ions; yea, tho' the Truthe of the Go&s;pel and your U&s;efulne&s;s be in never &s;o much Danger; and our Con&s;ciences never &s;o much offended; yet if you can &s;urmi&s;e or imagine in your &s;elf (being your own Judge) that our per&s;onal Conduct and Behaviour has been di&s;ta&s;teful to you; or that our De|&s;ires for Peace are not real; or if you can dwindle (the great Charges of not preaching the Doctrines of Grace as you ought; and other material Errors and Defects laid again&s;t you) into Trifles, as not &s;eeing ju&s;t as we do in the Times; or unle&s;s we return to your Mini&s;try and Communion, without any Satisfaction; and the Cau&s;es of the temporary Withdrawment, don't only remain, but as we conceive, are greatly aggravated; that therefore we have no Right to de&s;ire a Church-meeting; that you are not in Duty obliged to call one; and that the Church have nothing to do, or that they can do nothing with Safety in the Matter (and &s;o you are &s;afe.) The Ab&s;urdity of this Way of Rea&s;oning, as al&s;o of your la&s;t Paper to our eight Charges, might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn: But we had done with di&s;puting before, for that be&s;ides our having argued out the Matter before, and &s;ignified our Intention to proceed no further in that Way: We are, <HI>Rev.

<P>Here note, he would have us make out what we had again&s;t him, but would give us no Opportunity, either to him&s;elf by Conference, to the Church at a Meeting; or to a Council called for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this Defeat, we &s;aw no Way left by the Rules of Order, but to bring on an Inquiry upon the Church, for neglecting the Means of Healing, agreable to the third Way of Communion; and being de&s;irous to try all Ways for Re|lief, agreable to the Con&s;titution of the&s;e Churches; we accordingly applied to the Pa&s;tor of the third Church in <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> to interpo&s;e in the Matter; and if he &s;hould find needful, to come with his Church to admoni&s;h this Church for their Neglect &amp;c. The Pa&s;tor &s;ome Time after made Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> a Vi&s;it, and then renew'd it, with two other Pa&s;tols in the Neighbourhood, but to no Pur|po&s;e: Some Time after the fir&s;t mentioned Pa&s;tor laid the Ca&s;e before his Church, who voted a Letter to Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> &amp;c. Thereupon we had &s;everal Church-meetings, but no Vote mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed; at one of which <HI>March</HI> 18th 1744, 5, the Aggrieved preferred another Reque&s;t for a Church-Meeting, to con&s;ider and pa&s;s upon their Affairs, before other Churches were concern'd, alledging that it could not be known what the true State of the Cau&s;e was; whether it was the Church, or only a minor Part that Really di&s;approved of his Conduct, &s;ince to that Time no Vote of the Church had ever been pa&s;&s;ed about our Affairs: But at this Meeting there was no Vote pa&s;s'd, nor any Thing done for us, nor was it thought that either Church or Pa&s;tor intended to do any Thing; nay, Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> &s;aid no Vote &s;hould be pa&s;s'd thereon by the Church, but what was agreable to his Mind; and the Church was willing it &s;hould be &s;o. Two Days after this, we received from the Pa&s;tor a Sheet, chiefly filled with jealous In&s;inuations and &s;evere Reflections, on Occa&s;ion of our Reque&s;t at the Meeting, but there was no direct An&s;wer thereto: However, at the &s;ame Meeting, the Pa&s;tor by a long Paper propo&s;ed to join in Council, but on Terms &s;o &s;ingular, that it is a pitty it's Length &s;hould forbid it a Place in this Narrative. However, we will mention &s;ome Particulars. (2d) Article was, that fourteen Churches &s;hould be called (at lea&s;t) to prevent the Multipli|city of Councils. This might well be adapted to another End; when he had &s;et all the Churches a&s;ide; that he might do by the next Propo&s;al, which was (3d) that neither of us &s;hould chu&s;e Churches, any of who&s;e Pa&s;tors have appeared by their Conduct to have e&s;pou&s;ed a Party among us, or that hath pre|judged either Side, or with whom we have had any per&s;onal Difference, or any Mi&s;under&s;tanding not yet i&s;&s;ued or decided. (4) That it mu&s;t appear that the Aggrieved were generally united in their Choice. (5) That the Choice made by each Party in Lanner afore&s;aid, &s;hould be refered to the &s;tanding Part of the Church, for their Con&s;ent and Approbation, to be &s;ignified by a Vote: &s;o that his own Party was to chu&s;e all at la&s;t, in Effect. Taking this Offer into Con&s;ideration, on the 15th we &s;ignified our Agreement thereto, with the fol|lowing Amendments, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That the Number of Churches &s;hould be fix, eight, or ten, in&s;tead of fourteen, or more.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) That there was too much
<PB N="11" REF="005920_0010_10292B029035C3D8">uncertainty in the Qualifications of the Churches; therefore we propo&s;ed to try, whether we could not agree upon the Churches before we clo&s;ed the Offer, or el&s;e that he would explain him&s;elf on that Head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) That his Part of the Church &s;hould determine our Choice, we could by no Means agree to: The&s;e Amendments being delivered him, the fair Offer of a Council dropt, as we &s;up|go&s;ed it would, being un&s;nared.</ITEM>
</LIST>
By this it may appear what was de&s;igned, when he told his Church he was for healing Matters.</P>
<P>But to proceed, on the 20th of the &s;ame Month, we received another Paper from our Pa&s;tor, &s;ignifying that the Rea&s;on why we did not join in Council upon his &s;aid Plan, was becau&s;e we were afraid of our Cau&s;e (indeed we might have Rea&s;on enough for Fear from the Nature of his Plan, without the le&s;t Regard to the Merits of our Cau&s;e.) But he &s;aid nothing to our propo&s;ed A|mendments; and makes another Offer &s;till more conde&s;cending in Shew, <HI>viz.</HI> That if we plea&s;ed we might call a Council our &s;elves, but he thought it un|rea&s;onable to refer him&s;elf to them; tho' he &s;hould pay a Deference to their Advice if they were not ju&s;tly chargeable with Weakne&s;s or Partiality: But whereas this was no more than we might do without his Con&s;ent, and to no Pur|po&s;e, whatever their Judgment might have been; we regarded this Offer only as tantalizing of us, calculated by it's &s;eeming Fairne&s;s to confirm the more fluctuating and con&s;cionable Part of his Adherents: Therefore we took no farther Notice of it. Hereupon, when the &s;aid third Church of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> &s;aw nothing was brought to pa&s;s to Purpo&s;e, came <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1745, and blamed the Church for their Neglect; advi&s;ed to join in Council, and &s;o left us: Agreable to this Advice we proceeded to nominate &s;ome Churches, and eight were agreed upon: But before we proceeded any further, it was whi&s;pered about, that Things might be accommodated among&s;t our &s;elves by Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI>'s leaving us on certain Conditions: accordingly Committees were cho&s;en on both Sides, to tran&s;act this Affair: The Conditions agreed upon were principally the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the major Part &s;hould con&s;ent to his going.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That we &s;hould buy his E&s;tate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That he and the Aggrieved &s;hould forgive one another all per&s;o|nal Offences, and part on peaceable Terms.</ITEM>
</LIST>
On the&s;e Conditions he would leave us the next <HI>March.</HI> Nothing could be more agreable to us: The Pro&s;pect of Peace was &s;o plea&s;ing, that without any Security from the Pa&s;tor to perform his Part, we readily &s;igned a Paper of his drawing up, whereby we freely for|give each other al&s;o, a&s;king pardon of God, declaring that all Controver&s;ies, Offences, and Papers, relating to the &s;ame, &s;hould be from thenceforth null and void. And that no Time might be lo&s;t, the next Day a Paper drawn by him was delivered to two of the Church of his agreeing to, for to be carried about, to &s;ee whether a major Part of the People would &s;ign it; which was accordingly done; and a majority of the Church did &s;ign it; and then it was to be laid be|fore the Pari&s;h: But e'er this was effected, it was reported, that the Pa&s;tor did not &s;ign to go or leave the Place; and he being que&s;tioned thereon, the Reports were confirmed: It was for Rea&s;on alledged, that the Paper was longer in &s;ign|ing than he expected; that People had been per&s;waded into it; and to tell the Truth, that no &s;uch Promi&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and that he had &s;aid nothing, whereby they had Rea&s;on to think he intended it; or Words importing as much. It may, we think, ea&s;ily be conceived how this mu&s;t &s;urprize us; and how our Relief in a Way of Order, (which we had for &s;ome Years been labouring after)
<PB N="12" REF="005920_0011_10292ACFC66E60A8">was rendred impracticable. Our Controver&s;ies hove up a general Forgivene&s;s pa&s;s'd, and nothing to &s;hew under Hand, of the Promi&s;e that induced us to do this: (What can be thought of &s;uch a Pa&s;tor!) It is true, the Pa&s;tor has &s;ince owned it in a Paper dated <HI>Febr.</HI> 7th 1745, 6. containing his Rea&s;ons why he did not go: By this Means our Hands were ty'd, being turned out of the Way of Relief by Council, which taken together, with all we had met with, before; we might well conclude it impracticable ever to obtain any Relief in a Way of Order; he was &s;o artful and &s;hifting; we had endeavoured it, by applying to our Pa&s;tor,&mdash;to the Church,&mdash;to him to join in Council, and by an Inquiry for three or four Years; and now &s;aw our &s;elves as far from Deliverance, as when we fir&s;t began: However, we had this Advantage by the Pacification, that five out of &s;ix of our Number, that were (<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2. 1745) laid under Su&s;pen|&s;ion by the Church for withdrawing from their Communion, for Cau&s;es concern|ing which they had then never &s;ignified their Minds, were relea&s;ed from that Cen&s;ure; whereby we had the Advantage of going off without that Incum|brance or Di&s;advantage we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have had, if a Cen&s;ure be e&s;teem|ed &s;o, from a Pa&s;tor and Church behaving as our's had done. Here, let it be noted, that this Su&s;pen&s;ion was the fir&s;t and only Vote that the Church ever to the Date thereof pa&s;&s;ed upon our Affairs, and this had no Re&s;pect to the Merits of the Controver&s;y: What Order of Di&s;cipline mu&s;t this be! Sometime after this, when Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> and Church were, as we apprehended, about again to lay us under Cen&s;ure, we went into the Meeting, and there declared, our withdrawing from them in Form: And this brings up the Matter to the End of this Affair; for our appearing afterwards before Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI>'s Council, was only in Token of our Re&s;pect to them, as Men and as Chri&s;tians, without the lea&s;t Thought of returning to our Pa&s;tor or Church again, that we had left; or of di&s;&s;olving that Church-Covenant we had entred into for the Maintenance of the Doctrines Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t in a Church-State by our|&s;elves, in the Pre&s;ence of a Council of Churches conven'd for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things we think Mr. <HI>Pickering,</HI> &s;hould have placed in the Front of his <HI>Bad Omen,</HI> if he had de&s;igned an impartial Judgment; for the Cau&s;e of the Cau&s;e, is the Cau&s;e of what is cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now from this Relation of Facts (if we have mi&s;taken or mi&s;repre&s;ented any, we will retract as &s;oon as convinced) the Ca&s;e may be thus &s;ummed up: A Number of Church Members were offended with the Preaching and Practice of their Pa&s;tor, and could get no Redre&s;s from him: They then agreable to their Duty and Privilege re&s;ulting from their Church-State, laid their Ca&s;e before the Church; they would do nothing for them, but by their total Negligence, and to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, pa&s;&s;ive Obedience to the Will and Dictates of their Pa&s;tor, &s;uffered their offended Brethren to be turned out of the Way of Relief, by any Rule known in our Con&s;titution, thro' Length of Time; which mu&s;t ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficient to di&s;pirit and di&s;courage any meer Man; yea, to pro|duce an utter unfitne&s;s for Church Communion and Fellow&s;hip together; and not only &s;o, but by this total Negligence to perform this Covennat-Obligation to their Brethren, vertually and in Rea&s;on have di&s;&s;olved the Obligations on the aggrieved's Part towards them, &s;o that hereby they have left them&s;elves not only without Excu&s;e for their Conduct, but al&s;o without Right to complain of any Thing that is done for them by others: Or more &s;hortly thus; We put
<PB N="13" REF="005920_0012_10292B05534A2BE0">our &s;elves under the Bonds of a Covenant with this Church, that we might en|joy the Priviledges of &s;uch a State, which they then promi&s;ed us; but thro' their Neglect or ill Conduct, we could not enjoy tho&s;e Priviledges, they kept not their Promi&s;e to us; &s;o that of Cour&s;e our Obligations to them, and their Right over us, mu&s;t be vertually di&s;&s;olved, and we left at Liberty to provide for our&s;elves as before we enter'd into that Covenant: And hence let us put this Que&s;tion; <HI>What could we have done more?</HI> Or what more in Rea&s;on could be expected to be done by us, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered? Or which is an Omen of mo&s;t Evil to the&s;e Churches, for a Pa&s;tor and Church thus to treat their Members and to pa&s;s with Indemnity? or for the&s;e Members &s;o treated, to &s;et up for them&s;elves, as we have done?</P>
<P>If it be objected,</P>

<P>To which we &s;ay, That we do not take the Argument to lie here: We took them to be real, and that was &s;ufficient. The Que&s;tion is not now, whether they were groundle&s;s or not; but whether (they being thought real by us) the Church ought not to have acted upon them; advi&s;ed and admoni&s;hed the er|ring Party: However, to humour the Objector; we An&s;wer,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we did not &s;ubmit our Cau&s;e to the Council, and are &s;orry that we mu&s;t &s;latly deny Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> in that plain Fact. It is true, as we have al|ready hinted, that at their De&s;ire, we (who always &s;tood ready to give a Rea&s;on as well for our Conduct as for our Hope) did in &s;ome Mea&s;ure acquaint them with our Conduct and the Rea&s;on thereof: But as they were a Council, we had no Hand in calling, and were (as we under&s;tood) only &s;ummoned in, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Church in laying us under Cen&s;ure; e&s;pecially, as we were before this em|bodyed into a Church-State and Covenant by our &s;elves; we had not the lea&s;t Tho't of returning; and con&s;equently of &s;ubmitting our &s;elves to that Council.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This Council did not condemn us in all our Articles of Complaint; but judged we had hard U&s;age, and ju&s;t Rea&s;on to complain in &s;everal; tho' it mu&s;t be owned upon the whole, they turned the Scale in Favour of the Party that called them in; but this being agreable, as we think, to the general Cu&s;tom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That it is agreable to the general Cu&s;tom &amp;c. to turn the Scale in Favour of the Party &amp;c. we &s;uppo&s;e none will di&s;pute; and why mu&s;t it be thought &s;trange, that this &s;hould be the general Cu&s;tom of &s;uch; &s;ince Parties in a Controverly generally choo&s;e &s;uch Councellors as they think are of their own Sentiments, that will frame their Re&s;ult accordingly.</NOTE> of

<ITEM>3. That as we under&s;tand five Pa&s;tors out of nine did not vote the Re&s;ult, and three of them with &s;ome of the Delegates openly prote&s;ted again&s;t &s;ome main Parts of it, or at lea&s;t entred their Di&s;&s;ent therefrom: So that we hope before we are rejected on the Score of this Council's condemning of us, it will be&s;hewn when a Party Council ever did otherwi&s;e than to Ballance the Account in Favour of tho&s;e that call'd them in. However, we verily think, upon the peru&s;al of the Re&s;ult, we have full as much Credit given us as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, if not more. Nay, we believe that if &s;ome mi&s;taken and contradictory Conclu|&s;ions that are to be found therein were rectified and reconciled, the I&s;&s;ue would have been otherwi&s;e.</ITEM>

<P>But as we had nothing to do with the Council, or their Re&s;ult, we &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s it with this Remark, <HI>viz.</HI> That our being condemned by this Council, could not be &s;uch an in&s;uperable Ob&s;tacle in the Way of ordaining our Pa&s;tor, as Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> would have it: And it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Pickering</HI> fore&s;aw this, and therefore roundly tells the Publick, we &s;ubmitted our Cau&s;e to this Council, and therefore mu&s;t be concluded by their Act.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. Why did we not again move for Council, when he refu&s;ed to go away, upon the Pacification, or proceed in the third Way of Communion, as before intended? To which we An&s;wer,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we had been &s;o often &amp; in &s;o many Ways de&s;eated, we were quite di&s;couraged; for out Pa&s;tor always had Means at Hand, to turn us a&s;ide from the main Point; and a Pretence to ju&s;tify him&s;elf therein: Be&s;ides his own Party &s;eemed re&s;olved to protect him, let what would become of us. And further, by this Time we had &s;uch a di&s;like to his Mini&s;try and Conduct, that we could not endure the Thought of continuing under them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the third Way of Communion, it meets with no Encouragement in the&s;e Churches; we found by what we had done, that altho' our Pa&s;tor would agree to call in Council to heal our Divi&s;ions; yet in Ca&s;e we were in ear|ne&s;t to proceed in the third Way of Communion; he would call a Council of Advice, thereby to prevent the Proceeding in the third Way; for by this Time, we both had found, that it was the &s;ettled Opinion of the Rev. Pa&s;tor we had apply'd to, that in Ca&s;e a Church in like Circum&s;tances doth call in the Coun|cil of other Churches to advi&s;e about their Matters of Offence or Divi&s;ion; the third Way of Communion &s;tops of Cour&s;e, and can take no Place; and we had no Doubt, but tho&s;e that for their own Safety had &s;o often refu&s;ed to call in a Council when they might be endangered thereby, would from the &s;ame Prin|ciple readily enough call in one when it was nece&s;&s;ary for their Protection and Safety: Nor indeed do we know any Rule in our Con&s;titution, for any &s;mall Number to commence &s;uch a Proce&s;s; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, are well able to
<PB N="15" REF="005920_0014_10292B07602F1ED8">&s;upport the Expence that &s;uch a Proceeding mu&s;t be attended withal. No, we conceive the Rule is for Churches in &s;uch Ca&s;es to come of their own Accord, and upon their own Expence; and if they do not, the Aggrieved are deprived of the Help intended them by the Con&s;titution of the&s;e Churches: And were we now to be que&s;tioned by the&s;e Churches for leaving our Church and Pa&s;tor as we did, might we not, in An&s;wer, humbly and pertinently tell them, that the Church to which we belonged was rent with Divi&s;ions, and thereby became Scandalous, and for &s;everal Years together neglected to u&s;e the Means of Heal|ing, whereby we in particular, were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; that all this was pub|lickly known, and yet the Churches would not come for our Relief; therefore we were obliged to leave them as we did. On this Principle we think our Sepa|ration would have been excu&s;able, had we never moved in the third Way of Communion at all; how much more &s;o, &s;ince we proceeded in that Way as long as there was any Thing to be expected from it, as before hath been &s;hewn.</ITEM>

As to encouraging Separations, and &s;o endangering the Peace of the Chur|ches; we can truly &s;ay, that we di&s;like Separations on trivial and &s;lighty Rea|&s;ons, as much as any Chri&s;tians, and would with Humility caution again&s;t &s;uch, or of taking Example by us, to &s;eparate without weighty Rea&s;ons: But where Chri&s;tians are treated by Churches and Pa&s;tors, as we have been treated by ours, we have Freedom to &s;ay, that we have no great Concern about pre&s;erving the outward Peace of &s;uch Churches; and we think it highly offen&s;ive to God if they do not &s;eparate, &s;ince we can't &s;ee what Go&s;pel End can be &s;erved, for Per&s;ons to be held down under &s;piritual Tyranny, in order to &s;upport &amp; main|tain &s;uch a Peace. <HI>Ye are bought with a Price; be ye not the Servants of Men.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As to our having no Rule for our Proceeding, we An&s;wer, If we have no particular Rule in the Platform, we have Pre&s;idents both in the Word of God, and Church Hi&s;tory, to countenance the Thing.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) As to the Word of God, we find, that it not only ju&s;tifies us as to the Matter or Foundation-Cau&s;e of our Separation, as 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.1.-8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.3,&mdash;5. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 2 <HI>Joh.</HI> 7,&mdash;11. 3 <HI>Joh.</HI> 7,&mdash;10. 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.9. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.14,&mdash;<HI>uit. Jer.</HI> 23.16, 17.27,&mdash;32. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13th &amp; 34th <HI>Chap. Rom.</HI> 16, 17, 18. But al&s;o as to the Manner of it, by the Practice both of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, as I&s;ai. 8.11, 12. <HI>For the Lord &s;pake thus to me with a &s;trong Hand, and in&s;tructed me that I &s;hould not walk in the Way of this People, &s;aying, Say ye not a Confederacy to them to whom this Peo|ple &s;hall &s;ay, a Confederacy; neither fear ye their Fear; nor be afraid, but &s;anctify the Lord of Ho&s;ts &amp;c.</HI> Jer. 15.19. <HI>Let them return unto you, but return thou not unto them</HI> Act. 19.9. <HI>When divers were hardned, and believed not, but &s;pake Evil of that Way before the Multitude, he departed from them, and &s;eparated the

<ITEM>(2) As to Church-Hi&s;tory we &s;hall mention only the two great Examples, <HI>viz.</HI> the reformed Churches &s;eparating from the romi&s;h Church; and the Di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tab|li&s;hed Church of <HI>England;</HI> the Lawfulne&s;s of which has been &s;ufficiently de|fended again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers. And altho' we have not equal Rea&s;on upon all Accounts with the former, yet we verily think we have with the latter, for what we have done: But whether we have equal Rea&s;on with either, yet if we have &s;ufficient Grounds to leave the Church we belonged to; as in Con&s;cience we think we had, and hope we have made &s;ufficiently evident; we may ju&s;tly plead the&s;e Examples for our Ju&s;tification, and be &s;afe, while they are unmoved.</ITEM>

<P>We clo&s;e with a humble Addre&s;s to all Chri&s;tian Friends in this profe&s;&s;ing Land, who may peru&s;e this Narrative.</P>
<P><HI>Honoured and dearly beloved in our</HI> LORD JESUS: We a&s;k of you as tender, charitable and compa&s;&s;ionate a Regard, under our Circum&s;tances, as our Cau&s;e will bear: True it is, that in this our Time of Trial and Temptation, we in many Things may have offended both GOD and Man, for which we de&s;ire hum|bly to a&s;k both his and your Pardon; and in particular we do this of our late Pa&s;tor and adhering Brethren, for any undue Warmth &amp; Ra&s;hne&s;s in Speech or Behaviour, while our Controver&s;y was depending: However, we believe we can truly &s;ay in the Fear of God, that it has been our &s;incere and main De&s;ire and Endeavour to promote the Intere&s;t of true and vital Religion; that the Go&s;|pel might be preached to us with Clearne&s;s Power and Succe&s;s; that Sinners might be converted, and Saints edified to Life eternal; and we tru&s;t by &s;till pur|&s;uing the&s;e Things in a Way of Go&s;pel Order, Peace &amp; Charity, to recommend our&s;elves to you, and reflect Glory upon the Author of our Salvation; who alone can fini&s;h the &s;ame in us.</P>
<P>But if after all, any are re&s;olved to &s;tir up them&s;elves, and endeavour to hurt and di&s;turb us in what they may; the Will of the Lord be done! We can only &s;ay under &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions, as <HI>Luther</HI> did, when he had done &s;peaking before the Emperor and States of Germany, in the Maintenance of the &s;ame Prote&s;tant Cau&s;es, "I have &s;aid, and the Lord be merciful to me." Yea! one Thing more would we leave for the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch, which we have upon Divine Record, Pro. 17.15. <HI>He that ju&s;tifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Ju&s;t, even they both are Abomination to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>GOD grant that we may; and all that &s;hall peru&s;e this Narrative; be ever en|gaged in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e; and that all our Per&s;ons may be Righteous, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t the <HI>Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Amen.</P>
