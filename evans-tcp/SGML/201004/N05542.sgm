<HEAD>To the <HI>Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief, of the Province of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, <HI>and Counties of</HI> New-Ca&s;tle, Kent <HI>and</HI> Su&s;&s;ex, <HI>upon</HI> Delaware, <HI>The REPORT of</HI> RICHARD PETERS, ISAAC NORRIS, <HI>and</HI> BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, <HI>E&s;quires, Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to treat with &s;ome Chiefs of the</HI> Ohio Indians, <HI>at</HI> Carli&s;le, <HI>in the County of</HI> Cumberland, <HI>by a Commi&s;&s;ion, bearing Date the 22d Day of</HI> September, 1753.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the GOVERNOR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT knowing but the <HI>Indians</HI> might be waiting at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> we made all the Di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible, as &s;oon as we had received our Commi&s;&s;ion, and arrived there on the Twenty-&s;ixth, but were agreeably &s;urprized to find that they came there only that Day.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on our Arrival we conferred with <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> and <HI>George Croghan,</HI> in order to know from them what had occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent coming of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that we might, by their Intelligence, regulate our fir&s;t Intercour&s;e with them; and were informed, that tho' their principal De&s;ign, when they left <HI>Ohio,</HI> was to hold a Treaty with the Government of <HI>Virginia,</HI> at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> where they had accordingly been; yet they intended a vi&s;it to this Province, to which they had been frequently encouraged by <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> who told them, he had the Governor's repeated Orders to invite them to come and &s;ee him, and a&s;&s;ured them of an hearty Welcome; and that they had moreover &s;ome important Matters to propo&s;e and tran&s;act with this Government.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners finding this to be the Ca&s;e, and that the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of the <HI>Six Nations, Delawares, Shawone&s;e,</HI> with Deputies from the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> and <HI>Owendats,</HI> met them in Council, in which the Commi&s;&s;ioners declared the Contents of their Commi&s;&s;ion, acknowledged the Governor's Invitation, and bid them heartily welcome among their Brethren of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to whom their Vi&s;it was extremely agreeable. &mdash; <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> and <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> interpreting between the Commi&s;&s;ioners and <HI>Indians</HI> and &s;everal Magi&s;trates, and others, of the principal Inhabitants of the County, favouring them with their Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Twightwees</HI> and <HI>Delawares</HI> having had &s;everal of their great Men cut off by the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians,</HI> and all the Chiefs of the <HI>Owendats</HI> being lately dead, it became nece&s;&s;ary to condole their Lo&s;s; and no Bu&s;ine&s;s could be begun, agreeable to the <HI>Indian</HI> Cu&s;toms, till the Condolances were pa&s;&s;ed; and as the&s;e could not be made, with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, for want of the Goods, which were not arrived, and it was uncertain when they would, the Commi&s;&s;ioners were put to &s;ome Difficulties, and ordered the Interpreters to apply to <HI>Scarrowyady,</HI> an <HI>Oneido</HI> Chief, who had the Conduct of the Treaty in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and was a Per&s;on of great Weight in their Councils, and to a&s;k his Opinion, whether the Condolances would be accepted by Belts and Strings, and Li&s;ts of the particular Goods intended to be given, with A&s;&s;urances of their Delivery as &s;oon as they &s;hould come. <HI>Scarrowyady</HI> was plea&s;ed with their Application; but frankly declared, that the <HI>Indians</HI> could not proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s while the Blood remained on their Garments, and that the Condolances could not be accepted unle&s;s the Goods, intended to cover the Graves, were actually &s;pread on the Ground before them. A Me&s;&s;enger was therefore forthwith &s;ent to meet and ha&s;ten the Waggoners, &s;ince every Thing mu&s;t &s;top till the Goods came.</P>
<P>It was then agreed to confer with <HI>Scarrowyady,</HI> and &s;ome others of the Chiefs of the <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> and <HI>Delawares,</HI> on the State of Affairs at <HI>Ohio,</HI> and from them the Commi&s;&s;ioners learned, in &s;undry Conferences, the following Particulars, viz.</P>
<P>"THAT when the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania's</HI> Expre&s;s arrived at <HI>Ohio,</HI> with the Account of the March of a large <HI>French</HI> Army to the Heads of <HI>Ohio,</HI> with Intent to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Country, it alarmed the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;o much, that the <HI>Delawares,</HI> at <HI>Weningo,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, &s;ituate high up on <HI>Ohio</HI> River, went, agreeable to a Cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and forbad, by a formal Notice, the Commander of that Armament, then advanced to the <HI>Straits,</HI> between Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> and Lake <HI>Erie,</HI> to continue his March, at least not to pre&s;ume to come farther than <HI>Niagara.</HI> This had <PB N="4" REF="007026_0003_102AEBEEA4646800">not however any Effect, but, notwith&s;tanding this No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the <HI>French</HI> continued their March; which, being afterwards taken into Con&s;ideration by the Council, at <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs-Town,</HI> they ordered &s;ome of their principal <HI>Indians</HI> to give the <HI>French</HI> a &s;econd Notice to leave their Country, and return Home, who meeting them on a River running into Lake <HI>Erie,</HI> a little above <HI>Weningo,</HI> addressed the Commander in these Words:</P>

<P>WE were further told by <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> that when the An&s;wer to this Me&s;&s;age was brought to <HI>Logs-Town,</HI> another Council was held, con&s;i&s;ting of the <HI>Six Nations, Delawares,</HI> and <HI>Shawone&s;e,</HI> who unanimou&s;ly agreed to divide them&s;elves into Two Parties, One to go to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> with <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> and the other to go with the <HI>Half King</HI> to the <HI>French Commander,</HI> who had it in Charge to make the following Declaration, as their third and la&s;t Notice.</P>

<HEAD>The Third Notice, delivered by the <HI>Half King</HI> to the Commander of the <HI>French Forces.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You &s;ay you cannot come to our Council Fire at <HI>Logs-Town,</HI> we therefore now come to you, to know what is in your Heart. You remember when you were tired with the War (meaning Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s War) you of your own Accord &s;ent for us, de&s;iring to make Peace with us; when we came, you &s;aid to us, Children, we make a Council Fire for You; we want to talk with you, but we mu&s;t fir&s;t eat all with one Spoon out of this Silver Bowl, and all drink out of this Silver Cup; let us exchange Hatchets; let us bury our Hatchets in this bottomle&s;s Hole; and now we will make a plain Road to all your Countries, &s;o clear, that <HI>Onontio</HI> may &s;it here and &s;ee you all eat and drink out of the Bowl and Cup, which he has provided for you. Upon this Application of yours we con&s;ented to make Peace; and when the Peace was concluded on both Sides, you made a &s;olemn Declaration, &s;aying, Whoever &s;hall hereafter tran&s;gre&s;s this Peace, let the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or be cha&s;ti&s;ed with a Rod, even tho' it be I, your Father.</P>
<P>Now, Father, notwith&s;tanding this &s;olemn Declaration of yours, you have whipped &s;everal of your Children; you know be&s;t why. Of late You have cha&s;ti&s;ed the <HI>Twightwees</HI> very &s;everely, without telling us the Rea&s;on; and now you are come with a &s;trong Band on our Land, and have, contrary to your Engagement, taken up the Hatchet without any previous Parley. The&s;e Things are a Breach of the Peace; they are contrary to your own Declarations: Therefore, now I come to forbid you. I will &s;trike over all this Land with my Rod, let it hurt who it will. I tell you, in plain Words, you mu&s;t go off this Land. You &s;ay you have a &s;trong Body, a &s;trong Neck, and a &s;trong Voice, that when you &s;peak all the <HI>Indians</HI> mu&s;t hear you. It is true, You are a &s;trong Body, and ours is but weak, yet we are not afraid of You. We forbid you to come any further; turn back to the Place from whence you came.</P>

<P>SCARROOYADY, who was the Speaker in the&s;e Conferences, when he had fini&s;hed this Relation, gave his Rea&s;on for &s;etting forth the&s;e three Me&s;&s;ages to the <HI>French</HI> in &s;o di&s;tinct a manner; becau&s;e, &s;aid he, the Great Being who lives above, has ordered us to &s;end three Me&s;&s;ages of Peace before we make War: &mdash; And as the <HI>Half King</HI> has, before this Time, delivered the third and la&s;t Me&s;&s;age, we have nothing now to do but to &s;trike the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007026_0004_102AEBF0317E5960">THE Commi&s;&s;ioners were likewi&s;e informed, by Mr. Croghan, that the <HI>Ohio Indians</HI> had received from the <HI>Virginia</HI> Government at large Number of Arms in the Spring, and that at their pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances a &s;uitable Quantity of Ammunition was ordered in the Treaty at <HI>Winchester</HI> to be lodged for them, in a Place of Security, on this Side the <HI>Ohio,</HI> which was committed to the Care of three Per&s;ons, viz. <HI>Gue&s;t, William Trent,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> who were impowered to di&s;tribute them to the <HI>Indians</HI> as their Occa&s;ions and Behaviour &s;hould require. That all the Tribes &s;ettled at or near <HI>Allegheny</HI> would, take their Measures from the Encouragement which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould find in the Province of <HI>Virginia</HI>; and that the kind Intentions of this Government in the Appropriation of a large Sum of Money for the U&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> in ca&s;e they &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their Enemies, and their Hunting and Planting prevented, were well known to them by the repeated Informations of <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> and the Traders.</P>
<P><HI>CONRAD WEISER,</HI> to whom it was earne&s;tly recommended by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, to procure all the Information po&s;&s;ible from the <HI>Indians</HI> of his Acquaintance, touching their Condition and Di&s;po&s;ition, and the real De&s;igns of the <HI>French,</HI> did likewi&s;e acquaint us, that all Per&s;ons at <HI>Ohio</HI> would have their Eyes on the Reception of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> now at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and judge of the Affection of this Province by their Treatment of them: and that as the intended Pre&s;ent was no Secret to tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> it was his Opinion, that the Whole &s;hould, at this Time, be di&s;tributed; for if any Thing can, &s;uch a generous Donation mu&s;t needs attach the <HI>Indians</HI> entirely to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THESE &s;everal Matters being taken into Con&s;ideration by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the Governor having given them expre&s;s Directions to accommodate them&s;elves to the Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as they &s;hould appear in examining them at the Place of Treaty, we were unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, that an Addition &s;hould be made to the Goods bought at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in which a Regard &s;hould be had to &s;uch Articles as were omitted or &s;upplied in le&s;s Quantities than was &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent Wants of the <HI>Indians.</HI> On this Re&s;olution the Li&s;ts of Goods were examined, and an additional Quantity bought of <HI>John Car&s;on,</HI> at the <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Price, and u&s;ual Rate of Carriage.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e Con&s;ultations, it was rumoured that the <HI>Half King</HI> was returned to <HI>Logs-Town,</HI> and had received an un&s;atisfactory Answer, which was confirmed, but not in &s;uch Manner as could be po&s;itively relied on, by a Brother of <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> and another Per&s;on who came directly from <HI>Allegheny.</HI> This alarmed the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and made them willing po&s;tpone Bu&s;ine&s;s till they &s;hould know the Certainty thereof, judging, that if the <HI>Half King</HI> was returned, he would certainly &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger Expre&s;s to <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> with an Account of what was done by him; and from this the Commi&s;&s;ioners might take their Mea&s;ures in the Di&s;tribution of the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A LETTER, wrote by <HI>Taaf,</HI> and <HI>Callender,</HI> two <HI>Indian</HI> Traders, dated the twenty-eight Day of <HI>September,</HI> from a Place &s;ituate a little on this Side <HI>Allegheny River,</HI> directed to <HI>William Buchannan,</HI> was given him in the Morning of the fir&s;t Day of <HI>October,</HI> and he immediately laid it before the Commi&s;&s;ioners for their Peru&s;al. In this Letter an Account is given, that the <HI>Half King</HI> was returned, and had been received in a very contemptuous Manner by the <HI>French</HI> Commander, who was then preparing with his Forces to come down the River; and that the <HI>Half King,</HI> on his Return, &s;hed Tears, and had actually warned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traders not to pa&s;s the <HI>Ohio,</HI> nor to venture either their Per&s;ons or their Goods, for the <HI>French</HI> would certainly hurt them. On this News the Conferences with <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> and the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations, Delawares,</HI> and <HI>Shawone&s;t,</HI> were renewed, and the Letter read to them, at which they appeared greatly alarmed; but, after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawone&s;e,</HI> &s;poke in the&s;e Words:</P>

You Know how to do this better than we. What we principally de&s;ire, is, that you will con&s;ider this Pre&s;ent as a Token of our cordial E&s;teem for You; and u&s;e it with a Frugality becoming your Circum&s;tances, which call at this Time for more than ordinary Care.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>WITH Plea&s;ure we behold here the Deputies of five different Nations, viz. the <HI>United Six Nations,</HI> the <HI>Delawares,</HI> the <HI>Shawone&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> and the <HI>Owendats.</HI> Be plea&s;ed to ca&s;t your Eyes towards this Belt, whereon &s;ix Figures are deleniated, holding one another by the Hands.

In whatever Part the Belt is broke, all the Wampum runs off, and renders the Whole of no Strength or Con&s;i&s;tency.

We would therefore hereby place before you the Nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving your Faith entire to one another, as well as to this Government. Do not &s;eperate: Do not part on any Score. Let no Differences nor Jealou&s;ies &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Moment between Nation and Nation: but join all together as one Man, &s;incerely and heartily. We on our Part &s;hall always perform our Engagements to every one of you. In Te&s;timony whereof, we pre&s;ent you with this Belt.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I desire you would hear and take Notice of what I am about to &s;ay now. The Governor of Virginia de&s;ired leave to build a &s;trong House on <HI>Ohio,</HI> which came to the Ears of the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI>; and we &s;uppose this caused him to invade our Country. We do not know his Intent; becau&s;e he &s;peaks with two Tongues. So &s;oon as we know his Heart, we &s;hall be able to know what to do; and &s;hall &s;peak accordingly to him. We de&s;ire that <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> would at pre&s;ent forbear &s;ettling on our Lands, over the <HI>Allegheny Hills.</HI> We advise you rather to call your People back on this side of the Hills, le&s;t Damage &s;hould be done, and you think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l of us.

<P>All we who are here de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> you will hear what we are going to &s;ay, and regard it as a Matter of Moment: The <HI>French</HI> look on the great Number of your Traders at <HI>Ohio</HI> with Envy; they fear they &s;hall lo&s;e their Trade. You have more Traders than are nece&s;&s;ary; and they &s;pread them&s;elves over our wide Country, at &s;uch great Di&s;tances, that we cannot &s;ee them, or protect them. We de&s;ire you will call back the great Number of your Traders, and let only three Setts of Traders remain, and order the&s;e to &s;tay in three Places, which we have appointed for their Residence, viz. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs-Town,</HI> the Mouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and the Mouth of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>: the <HI>Indians</HI> will then come to them, and buy their Goods in the&s;e Places, and no where el&s;e.

<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods are &s;old at too dear a Rate to us.

<P>YOUR Traders now bring &s;carce any Thing but Rum and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lead, or other valuable Goods. The Rum ruins us.

<P>THE &s;everal Articles which contain your ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Indian</HI> Traders, and the loo&s;e &s;tragling Manner in which that Trade is carried on, thro' Countries lying at great Di&s;tances from your Towns &mdash; Your Propo&s;als to remedy this, by having named three Places for the Traders to re&s;ide in, under your Care and Protection, with a Reque&s;t, that the Province would appoint the particular Per&s;on to be concerned in this Trade, for whom they will be an&s;werable &mdash; What you &s;ay about the va&s;t Quantities of Rum, and its ill Effects, and that no more may be brought a ong&s;t you; all the&s;e have made a very &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion upon our Minds; and was it now in our Power to rectify the&s;e Di&s;orders, and to put Matters on the Footing you propo&s;e, we would do it with great Plea&s;ure: But the&s;e are Affairs which more immediately concern the Government; in the&s;e therefore, we &s;hall imitate your Example, by laying them before the Governor, a&s;&s;uring you, that our heartie&s;t Repre&s;entations of the Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Regulations &s;hall not be wanting, being convinced, that unle&s;s &s;omething effectual be <PB N="11" REF="007026_0010_102AEBFB39268228">&s;peedily done in the&s;e Matters, the good People of this Province can no longer expect Safety or <HI>Profit</HI> in their Commerce, nor the Continuance of your Affection.</P>

<STAGE>Here the String given with the Reque&s;t was returned.</STAGE>
<P>HAVING delivered our general An&s;wer, we &s;hall now proceed to give one to what was &s;aid by particular Nations, as well by the <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> in the Forenoon, as by the <HI>Twightwees</HI> in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Delawares, <HI>and</HI> Shawone&s;e,</P>
<P>We are glad to &s;ee you in &s;uch good Di&s;po&s;itions to each other. We entreat you to do every Thing you can to pre&s;erve the Continuance of this agreeable Harmony. The <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> may be a&s;&s;ured we retain no Manner of Remembrance of their former Mi&s;carriages: We are perfectly reconciled, and our E&s;teem for their Nation is the &s;ame as ever.</P>
<STAGE>Gave a large String.</STAGE>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Twightwees,</P>
<P>We &s;hall take your &s;everal Pre&s;ents, Shells, Strings, Beaver, Blanket, and Calumet Pipe, with us, and deliver them to the Governor; that the&s;e and the &s;everal Things &s;aid at the Delivery of them, may remain in the Council Chamber, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for our mutual U&s;e and Remembrance, whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e the Great Being, who &s;its above, to bring us together in Council again.</P>
<P>Gave a long String.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>WE de&s;ire you will &s;end the&s;e two Strouds to the young King, as an Acknowledgment of our affectionate Remembrance of his Father's Love to us, and of our Good-will to him.</P>
<P>BE plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent to the Widow of the <HI>Pianka&s;ha</HI> King, our late hearty Friend, the&s;e Handkerchiefs, to wipe the Tears from her Eyes; and likewi&s;e give her Son the&s;e two Strowds to clothe him.</P>
<STAGE>Here two Handkerchiefs and two Strands were given.</STAGE>
<P><HI>Brethren</HI> Twightwees,</P>
<P>WE a&s;&s;ure you we entertain no hard Thoughts of you; nor in any wi&s;e impute to you the Misfortune that befel the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in your Town; it was the Chance of War: We were &s;truck together; we fell together; and we lament your Lo&s;s equally with our own.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Six Nations, Delawares, Shawone&s;e, Twightwees, <HI>and</HI> Owendats,</P>
<P>WE have now fini&s;hed our An&s;wers; and We hope they will be agreeable to you: Whatever we have &s;aid, has been with a hearty Good-will towards you; our Hearts have accompanied our Profe&s;&s;ions, and you will always find our Actions agreeable to them. Then the Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ilent; and after a Space of Time, renewed their Speeches to them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Six Nations, Delawares, Shawone&s;e, Twightwees, and Owendats,</P>
<P>WE have &s;omething to &s;ay to you, to which we entreat you will give your clo&s;e&s;t Attention, &s;ince it concerns both us and You very much.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>WE have held a Council on the pre&s;ent Situation of your Affairs. We have Rea&s;on to think, from the Advices of <HI>Taaf</HI> and <HI>Callender,</HI> that it would be too great a Ri&s;que, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent Di&s;order Things are in at <HI>Ohio,</HI> to encrea&s;e the Quantity of Goods already given you: We therefore acquaint you, that, though the Governor has furni&s;hed us with a larger Pre&s;ent of Goods, to put into your publick Store hou&s;e, as a general Stock, for your Support and Service, and we did intend to have &s;ent them along with you; we have, on this late di&s;agreeable Piece of News, altered our Minds, and determined, that the Goods &s;hall not be delivered till the Governor be made acquainted with your pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, and &s;hall give his own Orders for the Di&s;po&s;al of them. And that they may lie ready for your U&s;e, to be applied for, whenever the Delivery may be &s;afe, &s;ea&s;onable, and likely to do you the mo&s;t Service; we have committed them to the Care of your good Friend <HI>George Croghan,</HI> who is to tran&s;mit to the Governor, by Expre&s;s, a true and faithful Account how your Matters are likely to turn out; and on the Governor's Order, and not otherwi&s;e, to put you into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>THIS we hope you will think a prudent Caution, and a Te&s;timony of our Care for your real good and Welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007026_0011_102AEBFD28095420">Brethren,</P>
<P>WE have a Favour of a particular Nature to reque&s;t from your <HI>Speaker, Scarrooyady,</HI> in which we expect your Concurrence, and joint Intere&s;t; and therefore make it to him in your Pre&s;ence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<STAGE>Here the Commi&s;&s;ioners applying to <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> &s;poke as follows:</STAGE>
<P><HI>Re&s;pected Chief and Brother</HI> Scarrooyady,</P>
<P>We have been informed by <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> and <HI>George Croghan,</HI> that you did at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> in publick Council, undertake to go to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdina,</HI> to &s;ollicit the Relea&s;e of &s;ome Warriors of the <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> Nation, who are &s;aid to be detained in the Publick Pri&s;on of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> on Account of &s;ome Mi&s;chief committed by them, or their Companions, in the inhabited Part of that Province; and the&s;e two Per&s;ons, who are your very good Friends, have given it as their Opinion, if, after you know what has pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Ohio,</HI> you &s;hall now leave this Company of <HI>Indians,</HI> and not return with them to their Families, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Con&s;ultations with the <HI>Half King,</HI> and their other Chiefs, what Mea&s;ures to take in this unhappy Situation of your Affairs, all may be irrecoverably lo&s;t at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and the Lo&s;s with Ju&s;tice be laid at your Door. You may, perhaps, be afraid to di&s;oblige the <HI>Shawone&s;e,</HI> as it was at their In&s;tance you undertook this Journey; but we intend to &s;peak to them, and have no Doubt of obtaining their Con&s;ent; convinc'd as we are, that the Relea&s;e of the&s;e Pri&s;oners will be &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and more effectually procur'd by the joint Interpo&s;ition of the Governors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> than by your per&s;onal Sollicitation; in as much as our Governor, to whom we &s;hall very heartily recommend this Affair, can &s;end, with greater Di&s;patch, his Letters to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">span,</HI> than you can perform the Journey; for at this Sea&s;on, Opportunities pre&s;ent every Day of &s;ending by Sea to <HI>Charles-Town</HI>; and an Expre&s;s by Land may be di&s;patched to Governor <HI>Dinwiddie,</HI> as &s;oon as we return to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<STAGE>Gave a String.</STAGE>
</SP>
<P>THE <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> Chiefs expre&s;&s;ing Di&s;&s;atisfaction at this Endeavour of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;top <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> it gave us &s;ome Trouble to &s;atisfy them, and obtain their Con&s;ent; but at la&s;t it was effected; and when this was &s;ignified to <HI>Scarrooyady,</HI> he made this An&s;wer.</P>
<SP>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I WILL, take your Advice, and not go to <HI>Virginia</HI> at this Time, &mdash; but go Home, and do every Thing in my Power for the common Good. And &s;ince we are here now together, with a great deal of Plea&s;ure I mu&s;t acquaint you, that we have &s;et a Horn on <HI>Andrew Montour</HI>'s Head, and that you may believe what he &s;ays to be true, between the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and you, they have made him one of their Coun&s;ellors, and a great Man among them, and love him dearly.</P>
<STAGE>Scarrooyady <HI>gave a large Belt to</HI> Andrew Montour, <HI>and the Commi&s;&s;ioners agreed to it.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<P>AFTER this Difficulty was got over, nothing el&s;e remained to be done; and as the Ab&s;ence of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> was dangerous, the Commi&s;&s;ioners put an End to the Treaty, and took their Leave of them, making private Pre&s;ents at parting, to &s;uch of the Chiefs, and others, as were recommended by the Interpreters to their particular Notice.</P>
<P>THUS, may it plea&s;e the Governor, we have given a full and ju&s;t Account of all our Proceedings, and we hope our Conduct will meet with his Approbation. But, in Ju&s;tice to the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Promi&s;es we made them, we cannot clo&s;e our Report, without taking Notice, That the Quantities of &s;trong Liquors &s;old to the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> in the Places of their Re&s;idence, and during their Hunting Sea&s;on, from all Parts of the Counties over <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> have encrea&s;ed of late to an inconceivable Degree, &s;o as to keep the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> continually under the Force of Liquor, that they are hereby become di&s;&s;olute, enfeebled and indolent when &s;ober, and untractable and mi&s;chevious in their Liquor, always quarreling, and often murdering one another: That the Traders are under no Bonds, nor give any Security for their Ob&s;ervance of the Laws, and their good Behaviour; and by their own Intemperance, unfair Dealings, and Irregularities, will, it is to be feared, entirely e&s;trange the Affections of the <HI>Indians</HI> from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> deprive them of their natural Strength and Activity, and oblige them either to abandon their Country, or &s;ubmit to any Terms, be they ever &s;o unrea&s;onable, from the <HI>French.</HI> The&s;e Truths, may it plea&s;e the Governor, are of &s;o intere&s;ting a Nature, that we &s;hall &s;tand excu&s;ed in recommending in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Manner, the deplorable State of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and the heavy Di&s;couragements under which our Commerce with them at pre&s;ent labours, to the Governor's mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, that &s;ome good and &s;peedy Remedies may be provided, before it be too late.</P>
