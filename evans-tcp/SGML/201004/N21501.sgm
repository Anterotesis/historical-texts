<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOLOMON</HI> ob&s;erves that many are the devices of a man's heart, but the coun&s;el of the Lord, that &s;hall &s;tand. Many have been the devices of men's hearts and heads, again&s;t chri&s;tianity. From its youth up have they fought again&s;t it; but it is the coun&s;el of the Lord, and therefore has hitherto &s;tood, and if there be any truth in the divine promi&s;es, it will forever maintain its ground. This is an age when the love and practice of true religion is greatly on the decline, when iniquity abounds, and when infidelity rai&s;es her infernal head, and refu&s;es to be a&s;hamed. There are many who boldly profe&s;s their di&s;belief of a divine reve|lation, and employ all their wit and ingenuity in order to exhibit the mo&s;t important doctrines of our holy reli|gion in a ridiculous point of view. Per&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f &s;uch depraved minds, examine the Scriptures as it were with a micro&s;cope, which confines them to &s;ome &s;ingle point, but does not enable them to contemplate the beau|ty and con&s;i&s;tency of the whole, or to perceive the rela|tion which each part has to another. Nay, &s;ome of our modern infidels are &s;o daring and pre&s;umptuous
<PB REF="028262_0003_0FD7DAB3EF661FF0">as to condemn the whole &s;y&s;tem of divine revelation as a cunningly devi&s;ed fable, declaring at the &s;ame time, that the Bible is a book with which they are very little acquainted. But every good man can &s;ay from his own experience, that the more he examines the Scrip|tures, with an humble, an hone&s;t, and unprejudiced mind, and with a &s;incere de&s;ire to attain the knowledge of the truth, the more he will admire them. For they are like tho&s;e per&s;ons whom an intimate acquaintance endears more and more, whatever prejudices we might at fir&s;t &s;ight have conceived again&s;t them. He will find that they afford as much light as our pre&s;ent con|dition &s;tands in need of, and much more than we could po&s;&s;ibly attain, by the exerci&s;e of our una&s;&s;i&s;ted faculties. The Bible is a book which takes in a va&s;t extent of time. It begins with the creation of the world, and the formation of man, and ends in eternity, with the la&s;t judgment and the con&s;ummation of all things. And yet, through all this variety of di&s;pen&s;ations there is one chain, and regular &s;eries of well connected events. And is it not highly proper, that chri&s;tians &s;hould be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;aith of the&s;e important truths, and be able to give a good rea&s;on for the hope that is in them: e&s;pecially at a period when the emi&s;&s;aries of Satan are employing every engine to undermine the grounds of our holy religion. But from what &s;ource does infidelity &s;pring? The an&s;wer is obvious; it proceeds from the depravity of the human heart. When our hearts are deceitful, when our lives are immoral, we wi&s;h to bani&s;h from our minds the idea of the righ|teous judge of all the earth, who will render unto every one according to his works. And it is not very diffi|cult for us to per&s;uade our&s;elves into the belief of what we earne&s;tly wi&s;h to be true. And il has been fre|quently ob&s;erved, that the more vicious the age, the more has infidelity gained ground. This was the ca&s;e in ancient Greece and Rome, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;y&s;tem of Epicurus was patroni&s;ed by many of much
<PB N="v" REF="028262_0004_0FD7DAB575A1A128">greater and more eminent abilities, than any that now e&s;pou&s;e infidelity. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e in Judea, when the &s;ect of the Sadducees prevailed. But perhaps &s;ome may be ready to &s;ay, that the great number of dei&s;tical books, which have been lately written in this country, and al&s;o imported from Europe, has occa&s;ion|ed the great degeneracy of the pre&s;ent age. But the truth is, it is the almo&s;t total depravity of &s;entiment in matters of religion, to which bad writers will be always ready to accommodate them&s;elves, which has occa&s;ioned tho&s;e infidel writings, which are &s;o carefully circulated and &s;o eagerly read by tho&s;e who deny the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And is it not high time for the friends of Je&s;us to exert them&s;elves in his &s;ervice, and to employ every mean in their power, for the &s;upport of his re|ligion. And is not this the time, when men of piety, and learning, and abilities, ought to employ their ta|lents, in the defence of that go&s;pel, upon which our everla&s;ting all depends. Many publications have ap|peared in the pre&s;ent age, which &s;eem to be very pro|perly calculated to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e. Some of the&s;e, however valuable in them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e but little known. This is the ca&s;e with the volume which is now offered to the public, and it is hoped that it will be peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable at this time, when our modern dei&s;ts are &s;o exceedingly zealous in &s;upporting and propagating the unhappy cau&s;e they have the misfor|tune to e&s;pou&s;e. If the&s;e &s;ermons are read with an unbia&s;&s;ed mind, I doubt not but they will be read with great advantage, which will certainly be the mo&s;t effec|tual way of prai&s;ing and recommending them. The Almighty who is wonderful in coun&s;el, and excellent in working, can ea&s;ily bring good out of evil. We &s;eem to be &s;unk into a fatal indolence and in&s;en&s;ibility with regard to the great objects of religion, and &s;ome &s;ignal judgments, &s;ome extraordinary manife&s;tations of the divine di&s;plea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, perhaps may be nece&s;&s;ary, to purge the inhabitants of this country, of their dro&s;s, and to

<HEAD>DISCOURSE I. The in&s;ufficiency of Natural Light, AND The nece&s;&s;ity of a Supernatural Revelation.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2. TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE has been a mighty controver&s;y in the world about fundamentals in religion, points ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be believed by all chri&s;ti|ans; how many &s;uch there are, and which they are. Now without entering into that debate, I take it for granted the &s;ubject before us, (the di|vine original of the Bible) mu&s;t be reckoned in the number of fundamentals. It is certainly a thing of the la&s;t importance to be well in&s;tructed in this matter. I have therefore thought fit to give you a few di&s;cour&s;es upon the in&s;piration, and great u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;criptures. I have hereto|fore treated upon this &s;ubject; but finding that &s;e|veral of you de&s;ire a fuller account of the&s;e things, I have determined to re&s;ume the point, and en|large the plan and &s;cheme; that I may take in the main matters that concern this important doctrine,
<PB N="2" REF="028262_0007_0FD7DABDF8483BD0">the e&s;tabli&s;hing and vindicating the authority of the Bible: which I reckon the more &s;ea&s;onable in regard of the peculiar oppo&s;ition it meets with at this time. To this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall con&s;ider the words I have read, <HI>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;pira|tion of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re|proof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Where we have two things ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have here a&s;&s;erted the divine original and authority of the &s;criptures. <HI>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> That the apo&s;tle re|fers immediately to the &s;criptures of the <HI>Old Te&s;|tament</HI> cannot be que&s;tioned. For, not to &s;ay the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> was not (all of it) then written, he &s;peaks of the &s;criptures that <HI>Timothy</HI> had been edu|cated in the knowledge of, <HI>from a child thou ha&s;t known the holy &s;criptures,</HI> which could be no other than the &s;criptures of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament.</HI> But whereas he affirms, that <HI>all &s;criptures were given by in&s;piration of God;</HI> and it is probable &s;everal books of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> might then be written, the&s;e mu&s;t be included in the general expre&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, when he mentions <HI>Timothy's</HI> knowledge of the holy &s;criptures, and takes notice of their &s;uffi|ciency <HI>to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation,</HI> he adds, <HI>through faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> which &s;eems to lead us to the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> where we have the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t revelation of him.</P>
<P>And indeed, whatever evidence the <HI>Jews</HI> had of their canons being divine and given by in&s;pira|tion, we have the &s;ame, and greater, for the divi|nity of ours. If the &s;criptures of the <HI>Old Te&s;ta|ment</HI> were <HI>by in&s;piration of God,</HI> tho&s;e of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> are certainly no le&s;s &s;o; and con&s;e|quently, we may retain the apo&s;tle's general term, including the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e canon or all the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, and &s;ay, that <HI>all Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="028262_0008_0FD7DABF4BFBFE40">
2. We have the u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e in&s;pired wri|tings a&s;&s;erted here, They <HI>are profitable,</HI> &s;ays the text, <HI>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in|&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The meaning of the&s;e &s;e|veral phra&s;es I &s;hall enquire into afterwards, and &s;hew how the &s;cripture is u&s;eful for all the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean while, two propo&s;itions very natu|rally offer them&s;elves from hence; which I &s;hall lay down as the foundation of what I de&s;ign upon this &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) That <HI>all &s;cripture,</HI> or all the writings of the Old and New Te&s;tament, <HI>were given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) That the &s;criptures, or the &s;everal books and parts of the <HI>Bible,</HI> are of great u&s;e and &s;ervice to the church. Particularly, they <HI>are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truc|tion in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely, that the &s;criptures, all the books of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament, were given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> This is a point of great con&s;equence, among the funda|mentals of the chri&s;tian religion, as I &s;aid before; and therefore I &s;hall now take occa&s;ion to con&s;ider it pretty fully. To mo&s;t of you, I doubt not, what will be &s;aid will be wholly new, and others may find advantage in a review of the &s;ubject, as it tends to refre&s;h their memories, confirm their faith, and improve their joy.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall,

<ITEM>(1.) give &s;ome account of the in&s;piration of the holy &s;crip|tures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) Shew how it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that <HI>all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> And then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) prove the divine in&s;piration of the &s;crip|tures, or, as we commonly expre&s;s it, that the Bible or &s;criptures of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> are the word of God.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="028262_0009_0FD7DAC1D623C538">
I. I &s;hall give &s;ome &s;hort account of the in&s;pi|ration of the holy &s;criptures: the &s;ubject is too <HI>copious,</HI> and it may be too <HI>curious,</HI> to be handled largely here, and is fitter for the <HI>pre&s;s</HI> than the <HI>pul|pit.</HI> However, I &s;hall mention a few particulars for explaining it, as far as &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e will allow.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;uppo&s;e divine revelation lay in &s;ome ex|traordinary, immediate, &s;en&s;ible intercour&s;e that the in&s;piring &s;pirit, from whence the afflatus or in|&s;piration proceeded, had with the minds of tho&s;e that were in&s;pired: in making impre&s;&s;ion or motion on the imagination, and thereby conveying &s;uch and &s;uch things to the mind of the per&s;on concerned. When we conver&s;e with one another by words, a vibration or peculiar kind of motion is made in the air, which &s;trikes the ear of the per&s;on, and occa&s;i|ons a motion in the brain, whereby thoughts and ideas are excited, or our thoughts tran&s;mitted to the mind of him we &s;peak to&punc; now when God in&s;pires any he makes &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon, or motions in the brain immediately, and &s;o tran&s;mits his mind and will to the per&s;on he in&s;pires. Indeed this is not ea&s;ily apprehended by us; nor is it ea&s;y to ap|prehend how my &s;peaking to you, conveys &s;uch or &s;uch ideas to your minds. But as we are &s;ure this is po&s;&s;ible and fact, the other certainly may be al|lowed equally po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e that were in&s;pired knew as certainly that they were &s;o and that it was from God that they received the impre&s;&s;ions, as you know that I am now &s;peaking to you. I grant this is not ea&s;y to be conceived or explained by others, (as I have already &s;aid.) But tho&s;e concerned in it had &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible a&s;&s;urance that it was God who &s;pake to them, as le&s;t them free from all &s;u&s;picion of impo&s;|ture. This is manife&s;t in the ca&s;e of <HI>Abraham.</HI> He heard a voice from Heaven, which bid him <HI>take</HI> his <HI>&s;on, his only &s;on, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e loved, and get him into
<PB N="5" REF="028262_0010_0FD7DAC3E7C457F8">the land of</HI> Moriah <HI>and there offer him up for a burnt-offering.</HI> A command &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;tartling, in regard to the matter of it, that had he not had the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;urance it was from God, he would have abhorred the motion. There was &s;omething in the manner of the in&s;piration, that carried its own evidence along with it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The in&s;pired were not only a&s;&s;ured them|&s;elves of their own in&s;piration, but were enabled to give &s;atisfaction to others concerning that mat|ter. They felt, and certainly knew, they were in&s;pired; and could evidence it to others. How the ancient prophets proved their commi&s;&s;ion, au|thority and in&s;piration, I mu&s;t not now enquire; only I would hint in &s;hort, that there were three ways, among others, of proving this, viz. by work|ing of miracles, by foretelling things to come, things that came to pa&s;s afterwards, and by the te&s;timony of known allowed prophets. When God &s;ent any to make a new revelation, they did not expect men &s;hould believe them upon the au|thority of their own mere word, but they produced their credentials, <HI>the works they did te&s;tified concern|ing</HI> them, as Chri&s;t &s;peaks in his own ca&s;e. Thus we read that God <HI>bore Wilne&s;s</HI> to the apo&s;tles <HI>with &s;igns, wonders and diver&s;e miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> This te&s;timony often attended the doctrine of in&s;pired per&s;ons, and always it may be, when they delivered a new doctrine to the world. In other ca&s;es, when they were only &s;ent to incul|cate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> doctrine already revealed, and call men to the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">vation of a known law, miracles or pre|diction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight not be nece&s;&s;ary. But then &s;uch per|&s;ons ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e te&s;timony of known and approved prophets; were received by the &s;chool of the pro|phets, or by &s;ome or other of the prophetic cha|racter, who&s;e authority had been &s;ufficiently &s;ealed from heaven. And then,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="6" REF="028262_0011_0FD7DAC5305AB150">
4. The in&s;piring &s;pirit did not act and influence all that were in&s;pired in one and the &s;ame manner, but variou&s;ly. This the apo&s;tle hints at <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 1. <HI>God who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">undry times and in diver&s;e manners &s;pake in times pa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the fathers by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t day &s;poken unto us by his &s;on.</HI> He &s;pake by the prophets in <HI>diver&s;e manners.</HI> Some had reve|lations made to them by vi&s;ion in the day, others by dreams in the night: &s;ome by a voice formed in the air, (called a voice from heaven) and others by a more immediate &s;ecret &s;ugge&s;tion. In &s;hort, God &s;ometimes &s;pake to their outward &s;en&s;es when awake, and &s;ometimes to their more inward &s;en&s;es, as I may &s;ay in dreams and extacies, the mind be|ing &s;till informed concerning the meaning of &s;uch repre&s;entations in both ca&s;es. Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. As the &s;pirit communicated him&s;elf to them in different ways, &s;o there was a difference in the kind or degree of in&s;piration. And here to pa&s;s over other le&s;s material di&s;tinctions, I &s;hall take notice of that common and well known one, into an in&s;piration of &s;ugge&s;tion, and an in&s;piration of di|rection.</P>
<P>There was an in&s;piration of &s;ugge&s;tion; which was, when the whole matter that this or that in&s;pir|ed per&s;on was to publi&s;h to the world, whether by word or writing, was revealed to him <HI>de Novo,</HI> and entirely communicated to him from above. Many of the writers of the Holy Scripture had &s;uch an in&s;piration as I now refer to, an in&s;piration of &s;ug|ge&s;tion. The ancient prophets had it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ch of their prophecies as contained predict on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ncern|ing the future &s;tate of the church; as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, his life, death, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. They had it al&s;o in their prophecies concerning the ri&s;e and fall of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our monarchies, and in foretelling many other events relating to the church and the world; and no doubt in de&s;cribing many pa&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="028262_0012_0FD7DAC6E0D672C8">events. So Mo&s;es, in giving the hi&s;tory of the creation, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the whole matter, the entire proce&s;s of that great work laid before him, and communicated to him, by the &s;pirit of God. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> writers in many in&s;tances; as in their prophecies concerning the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the &s;preading the go&s;pel, &amp;c. and it is certain <HI>John</HI> mu&s;t have this kind of in&s;piration in delivering his vi&s;ions mentioned in the <HI>Revelations.</HI> He paints there a &s;cene of things which extends through every age of the church, to the end of the world; which he could not have done without that &s;ort of in&s;piration I am &s;peaking of, or with any le&s;s de|gree of it. The apo&s;tles had a like degree of in|&s;piration in publi&s;hing to the world &s;uch things as are termed <HI>my&s;teries;</HI> as the calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Eph. iii. 2, 3, 4, 5; the conver&s;ion and calling of the <HI>Jews</HI> into the chri&s;tian church, Rom. xi. 25, 26. The re&s;urrection of the body, 1 Cor. xv. The&s;e and the like were my&s;teries, things they could have no notion of, till God revealed or &s;ug|ge&s;ted them to them by his &s;pirit. And I reckon they had the &s;ame in&s;piration in expounding many pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> and accommodating them to the &s;tate of things under the go&s;pel, apply|ing them to this or that event. In the&s;e, and many other in&s;tances, the &s;acred writers had the in&s;pira|tion of &s;ugge&s;tion, the matter they delivered and publi&s;hed they had wholly and immediately from the &s;pirit of God.</P>
<P>But then there was another kind, a lower degree of in&s;piration, namely, that of direction. And this I &s;uppo&s;e all the &s;acred writers had in &s;everal ca&s;es. As for in&s;tance, when the evangeli&s;ts relate that <HI>Judas</HI> betrayed his ma&s;ter, and that <HI>Peter</HI> denied him, they need not herein be in&s;pired in the for|mer &s;en&s;e, need not have the&s;e points of hi&s;tory &s;ug|ge&s;ted
<PB N="8" REF="028262_0013_0FD7DB17DE0695A0">to them, as if they had known nothing of the matter, which ob&s;ervation may be applied to mo&s;t of the other hi&s;torical narrations contained in the &s;criptures. Where the penmen knew the things they recorded, it is rea&s;onable to conclude they had no more than the in&s;piration of direction: the &s;pirit of God fir&s;t &s;tirring them up to write, direct|ing them to make a fit choice what to write, and what not to write; and then guiding them in the performance. Further,</P>
<P N="6">6. All the penmen of the holy Scripture had that degree of in&s;piration, that divine <HI>afflatus</HI> or a&s;&s;i&s;tance that effectually &s;ecured them from errors and mi&s;takes. Some had the higher mea&s;ures thereof, the whole matter, and it may be the very words and &s;yllables &s;ugge&s;ted to them, while others had only direction and conduct in delivering what they were intru&s;ted with. Yet all of them were infallible, they delivered nothing but what is true, and what may be depended upon as true. I might add,</P>
<P N="7">7. That the holy &s;pirit when he in&s;pired the per|&s;ons who penned the Scriptures, not only left them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their natural faculties, but to the free exerci&s;e and u&s;e of them. They were not like a trumpet that a man &s;peaks through, nor like the <HI>Pagan Oracles,</HI> mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments in deliver|ing their me&s;&s;ages and doctrines. But they had their rea&s;on, memory, under&s;tanding, and all their rational powers, which they made u&s;e of and em|ployed: And in many in&s;tances were even allowed to indulge their own fancies and phra&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly touched and explained the in&s;piration of the Bible; in the next place.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to hint how it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that <HI>all Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> For &s;o &s;ays the text, and this is what we are taught to believe that the whole Bible is of divine original,
<PB N="9" REF="028262_0014_0FD7DB1979FA1A20">the word of God. The que&s;tion is, How we mu&s;t under&s;tand this? Now certainly it is not meant, that God him&s;elf &s;pake immediately all the things contained in the Scripture; &s;ometimes indeed he is introduced and repre&s;ented as &s;peaking immedi|ately, as to <HI>Job</HI> out of a whirlwind, <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 1. and at the giving of the law on <HI>Mount Sinai, Exed.</HI> xx. Though &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> make it probable, that he u&s;ed the mini&s;try of angels on that occa&s;ion, particularly, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>If the word &s;poken by angels, was &s;tedfa&s;t, &amp;c.</HI> The mat|ter &s;eems to have been thus; the <HI>Schechinah</HI> ap|pearing on the <HI>Mount</HI> with the u&s;ual guard of at|tending angels, made u&s;e of their mini&s;try in deli|vering the law to the people of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e that all tho&s;e who are brought in &s;peaking in the Scripture, &s;peak from God. The <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> contains a great many hi&s;tories of the words and actions of bad men. The book of <HI>Job</HI> relates the words of the Devil him&s;elf, and the mi&s;taken &s;peeches of <HI>Job's</HI> friends. The evangeli&s;ts give you the words of the <HI>Scribes, Phari&s;ees,</HI> and other avowed enemies of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel: as likewi&s;e doth <HI>Luke</HI> in his hi&s;tory of the acts of the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>So that when the apo&s;tle here &s;ays, <HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God,</HI> we are to take it thus, that all the writers of the &s;acred Scripture were by the &s;pirit of God infallibly a&s;&s;i&s;ted to write tho&s;e things that are contained in the Bible for the u&s;e of the church. In &s;ome things they had an in&s;pir|ation in the fulle&s;t, highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, receiving their doctrine wholly from God. In other things they had only infallible conduct. So that all contained in the Bible is either a divine doctrine, or a true hi&s;tory. There are &s;everal wicked &s;peeches of bad men, &s;everal mi&s;taken &s;peeches of good men, there recorded. But the hi&s;tory is faithful and true.
<PB N="10" REF="028262_0015_0FD7DB1AAAFC0F10">Nothing is here &s;aid to be done, which was not done; nothing is here feigned; nothing fal&s;ely repre&s;ented.

<P N="1">1. I &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome particulars to prepare my way for what I intend to &s;ugge&s;t for the proof of the point. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me premi&s;e that the que&s;tion, Whether the Scripture be the word of God? is not to be taken for granted, nor the re&s;olution of it expected from the immediate te&s;timony of the holy &s;pirit. But it is capable of &s;olid evidence, and may and ought to be &s;ubmitted to a rational enquiry and trial.</P>
<P>It is not to be taken for granted as a fir&s;t princi|ple. Such principles there are (fir&s;t principles we call them), generally allowed and received: &s;elf-evident maxims agreeable to the rea&s;on of man|kind; and the&s;e are not to be di&s;puted and proved; but are the mediums by which we prove other things. But that the Scripture is the word of God, is not a principle of this kind. Indeed among chri&s;tians it is a principle allowed and received on all &s;ides. But when we have to do with unbeliev|ers, or when we are e&s;tabli&s;hing the ground and
<PB N="11" REF="028262_0016_0FD7DB1C28F90768">foundation of our &s;aith, we propo&s;e it to examina|tion. And I am &s;atisfied we may &s;tand the trial here, and &s;ubmit it to the mo&s;t critical enquiry that will proceed without prejudice and partiality. In &s;hort, this propo&s;ition, that our Bible is an in&s;pired book, is not to be believed without rational evi|dence, not to be admitted purely becau&s;e others have told us &s;o, becau&s;e it is received in the country where we live, or becau&s;e it pretends to be a revela|tion from God: for as much may be &s;aid of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> But it is to be proved; and upon evi|dence to be received and believed. The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> pretends his <HI>Bible</HI> is a revelation from heaven, the <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI> or di&s;ciple of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> pretends his <HI>Alcoran</HI> is &s;o. Now, I &s;ay, in order to determine that que&s;tion, rea&s;ons are to be offered on both &s;ides; and if the <HI>Mahometan</HI> can produce better rea&s;ons in behalf of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> than can be pro|duced in behalf of our Bible, the <HI>Alcoran</HI> ought to be pre&s;erred.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we depend on the te&s;timony of the &s;pirit for the re&s;olution of this que&s;tion, Whether the Scriptures be the word of God. Indeed the divine veracity, or authority of God &s;peaking in his word, is the rea&s;on into which our faith is ul|timately re&s;olved. <HI>What&s;oever God &s;ays, is true;</HI> this is a fir&s;t principle and maxim. I therefore believe all things contained in the Scripture, and what God has revealed, becau&s;e God is true, and cannot deceive me; here the faith of a chri&s;tian re&s;ts. But if it be a&s;ked, How do I know that God has &s;poke the&s;e things, or that the Bible is a reve|lation from God? I mu&s;t here &s;eek for rational evidence (as I &s;aid before); and not rely purely on God's te&s;timony, as it is recorded in the word, or expect an immediate te&s;timony from the &s;pirit, a &s;ecret whi&s;per, an inward &s;ugge&s;tion, that the
<PB N="12" REF="028262_0017_0FD7DB1DB8A213D0">Scripture is the word of God. For this is to re|&s;olve &s;aith into private in&s;piration, and make one in&s;piration a rea&s;on of receiving another, which opens the way to dangerous delu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the Scripture is to be proved by rational arguments, and received upon proper evi|dence; yet the te&s;timony of God's &s;pirit, rightly under&s;tood, is of great u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity to us, in order to the di&s;cerning the evidence of Scripture, and re&s;ting in it as a divine revelation. By the te&s;timony of the &s;pirit, I do not mean a particular in&s;piration to this or that particular per&s;on, but the inlightening &s;anctifying work of the holy &s;pirit in the hearts of believers. And concerning this, let me note two or three things. As, that the te&s;ti|mony of the &s;pirit doth not produce the evidence of the divinity of the Scriptures, but helps us to di&s;cern it. It doth not give, but &s;how the evi|dence, and prepares us to receive it. Thus when God opened the heart of <HI>Lydia,</HI> that &s;he attended to the apo&s;tle, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 14. &s;he became better di&s;|po&s;ed to inquire into and receive the chri&s;tian revelation, and to take in the evidence of the truth of it. God writes his law in the hearts of believers, impre&s;&s;es their minds with it, &s;anctifies them by his word, produces affections and inward frames agree|able thereto; and hereby he gives te&s;timony to his word in their hearts. <HI>The entrance of thy word giveth light,</HI> &s;aith the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> P&s;al. xix. That <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> converts the &s;oul, maketh wi&s;e the &s;imple,</HI> &amp;c. He intimates that this was the ground and rea&s;on of that high value that he and other devout per&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad for it. <HI>Thy te&s;timonies are more to be de&s;ire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than gold, you, than much fine gold: &s;wee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er al&s;o than the honey, and the honey-comb,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 10. So P&s;al. cxix. 140. <HI>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy &s;ervant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Now when good men find the great u&s;efulne&s;s and excellency of the word of
<PB N="13" REF="028262_0018_0FD7DB2707D39DC8">God, that it converts, quickens, conducts, comforts them; when they find an inward corre&s;pondence with it, that it de&s;cribes their various ca&s;es, con|flicts and frames, affords relief and con&s;olation in all their difficulties, is their light, their monitor and comforter; as they cannot but love it, &s;o they are better prepared to believe it on this account. And this, I reckon is that te&s;timony of God's &s;pirit, which helps believers to receive the word of God, <HI>as it is indeed the word of God.</HI> It has taken fa&s;t hold of them, they feel the power of the word, and ta&s;te its con&s;olation. God has given them his &s;pirit, and they know of the doctrine that it is of God. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, this is not the evidence of Scripture; but a help to receive that evidence, it removes prejudices, makes us attentive, recommends the Scripture to the mind; but it doth not exclude other rea&s;ons of believing, though it enforces them.</P>
<P>Further, I would note, that this te&s;timony of the &s;pirit of God did (it is likely) generally attend the preaching of the go&s;pel in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;ti|anity, together with miracles, and other extraordin|ary works. There was &s;ome extraordinary &s;uper|natural a&s;&s;i&s;tance indeed accompanying the mini|&s;try of the word. Thus <HI>Peter's</HI> &s;ermon we read converted three thou&s;and at once, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 41. And be&s;ides the numerous and &s;peedy conver&s;ions re|markable at that time, the chri&s;tian religion ap|peared to have an incommon wonderful efficacy and power among tho&s;e that received it. Hence, Lactantius &s;ays, <Q>Shew me a per&s;on that is wrath|ful and furious, by a few words of the go&s;pel, I will render him as meek as a lamb; &s;hew me a per&s;on that is intemperate, unclean, the chri&s;ti|an religion &s;hall render him &s;ober and cha&s;te.</Q> And the like he &s;ays in other in&s;tances. It plea|&s;ed God at the fir&s;t planting of the go&s;pel, and
<PB N="14" REF="028262_0019_0FD7DB29438A5388">in order to it, to arm his word with power. There was a glorious effu&s;ion of the divine &s;pirit, which &s;ubdued the hearts of men to the belief and obe|dience of the Scriptures, and wrought a ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">al reformation, even to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the world. Now where any experienced this divine energy of the &s;pirit, going along with the word and bearing te&s;timony to it, they could never que&s;tion the doc|trine it&s;elf. They found <HI>the word of God quick and powerful,</HI> and con&s;equently, could not but believe it was the word of God.</P>
<P>I might add, the &s;ame te&s;timony in one or other degree of it, is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;aving belief of the Scriptures. We may give a general a&s;&s;ent to this propo&s;ition, that the Scripture is the word of God; may be convinced by clear rational ar|guments, that it is &s;o. But we &s;hall not believe it, &s;o as to mind it, reli&s;h it, delight in it, and comport with the de&s;ign of it, (without which we do not in|deed believe it, and receive it as a revelation from God) we &s;hall not do this, I &s;ay, without the &s;pirit influences on our minds, enlightening the eyes, opening the heart, removing prejudices, and ca&s;ting down lofty imaginations.</P>
<P>Though &s;till let me repeat it, that what&s;oever the &s;pirit of God doth here, &s;ignifies not &s;o much to give evidence, as to di&s;cover evidence. His te&s;timony doth not prove the Scripture to be the word of God, but helps us to &s;ee the proof of it. It may indeed tend to &s;atisfy us in particular con|cerning the proof; but the proof is di&s;tinct from the te&s;timony; at lea&s;t, this te&s;timony is but one part of the proof, and cannot be pleaded with others, of whatever u&s;e it may he privately to our|&s;elves. But the&s;e things I know require a great deal more di&s;cour&s;e to explain them, and &s;et them in a full light, than at pre&s;ent I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> room for. To proceed to another propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="028262_0020_0FD7DB2A679D8290">
3. The revelation contained in the Scripture, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with, or oppo&s;ite to natural religion, (or the dictates of right rea&s;on and natural light;) nor, properly &s;peaking, di&s;tinct from it, but in|cludes it, and perfects it. I reckon the fir&s;t law or covenant innocent man was under, was made known in nature, the will of God concerning duty and rewards was vi&s;ibly therein. Man in his in|tegrity could not but di&s;cern his obligations to his maker, not to &s;ay, that he had the whole law and all his duty written upon his heart, and found a propen&s;ity and inclination thereto. There was no darkne&s;s in his mind, or depravity in his affections, but it was natural for him to love God, to conver&s;e with, and obey him in every in&s;tance; and like|wi&s;e a principle of love, ju&s;tice, and benignity to his neighbor was implanted in him. This, which may be called, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e law of nature, was the fir&s;t law, antecedent to any &s;upernatural revelation. This was the covenant of innocency, or works revealed in nature; and I reckon that the po&s;itive com|mand not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 17. was not the covenant it&s;elf, or fir&s;t law, but added as a te&s;t and trial of man's obedience, and as a mark of God's &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Now this law, &s;ounded on the nature of things, and on the relation man &s;tands in to God, his cre|ator, pre&s;erver, and &s;overeign, is immutable, can|not be changed, and never cea&s;es. Accordingly it runs through every di&s;pen&s;ation of religion. The patriarchs and <HI>Jews</HI> were under the obligation of it. And it &s;till remains as a branch of the go&s;|pel-di&s;pen&s;ation. It was &s;ummed up in the <HI>Deco|logue</HI> given to the <HI>Jews</HI> of old. Chri&s;t makes it in part the &s;ubject of his &s;ermon on the mount, where he illu&s;trates and comments upon it; and it is ex|plained through all the writings of the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment.</HI> So that &s;hould any a&s;k, Whether the <HI>Bible,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="028262_0021_0FD7DB2BF8C11550">or the law of nature, be a revelation from God? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, that the&s;e two are not oppo&s;ed. The <HI>Bible</HI> comprehends all the laws of nature. Whatever is agreeable to rea&s;on, and that rea&s;on could di&s;cover as matter of duty towards God, our neighbor and our&s;elves, this the <HI>Bible</HI> takes in and e&s;tabli&s;hes. In a word, the <HI>Bible</HI> contains the mo&s;t excellent &s;y&s;tem of morals in the world. There is nothing valuable in all the writings of the philo&s;ophers, but it is to be found in the <HI>Bible;</HI> all the laws of ju&s;tice, charity, meekne&s;s, gratitude, patience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they have recommended in their books, are not only &s;et in a better light, but more &s;trongly inforced in the <HI>Bible.</HI> Not but that the <HI>Bible</HI> contains a great deal more than this; but I thought fit here to remark, that it contains this; and con&s;equently, that our modern <HI>dei&s;ts,</HI> that talk &s;o much of natural religion, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on to ob|ject again&s;t the <HI>Bible,</HI> as being defective in that point. If they are for natural religion, they may find it there, and (as I &s;hall &s;hew by and by) with un&s;peakable advantage, compared with what they can learn and attain without the help thereof.</P>
<P N="4">4. Had mankind pre&s;erved their integrity, the light and purity of their minds, I do &s;uppo&s;e, they would have under&s;tood their duty in the whole compa&s;s and latitude of it, without any &s;upernatu|ral revelation. All the precepts of divine morality, all man's obligations and debts towards God, his neighbor and him&s;elf, would have laid open to him. He would have &s;een them clearly and di&s;tinctly, and been convinced of the equity and rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of them without teaching and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ument.</P>
<P>Not but that God might, even in that &s;tate have given po&s;itive laws by &s;pecial and &s;upernatural re|velation. He gave one &s;uch, you know, to <HI>Adam</HI> in innocency, concerning the tree of know edge; and you read, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 8. that <HI>they heard t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> voice

There would have been a con&s;tant intercour&s;e, no que&s;tion, be|tween God and man, had not man apo&s;tatized, and it is probable &s;ome occa&s;ional revelations, e&s;peci|ally with reference to po&s;itive duties. But here, I grant, I am talking in the dark, and can only con|jecture. But what I chiefly a&s;&s;ert, is, that had not man fallen and lo&s;t his original light and rectitude, all the duties of natural religion (as we call it) had been obvious and &s;elf-evident, and there would have needed no &s;upernatural revelation, either to di&s;cover, or inculcate and inforce them. I add,</P>
<P N="5">5. Such is the &s;tate of mankind, having apo&s;ta|tized and fallen from God, &s;uch the weakne&s;s and blindne&s;s of his mind, and &s;o general the depravity and corruption of his nature; that a &s;upernatural revelation is new become exceeding nece&s;&s;ary. This I might prove, (I think I might call it demon|&s;trate) at large. But that I may not be tedious, I &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf with ju&s;t touching a few heads of arguments. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let it be con&s;idered, that the law of nature with the rules and maxims of moral good and evil, however certain in them&s;elves and obvious at fir&s;t, are now become le&s;s legible to us. Such is the weakne&s;s and darkne&s;s of the human mind, &s;o many our prejudices, lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, that we cannot ea&s;ily read the law of nature, nor apprehend the demands of it. Some have magnified that repre|&s;entation and de&s;cription, the great philo&s;opher <HI>Tully</HI> gives us of this matter, (<HI>Tu&s;c. Que&s;t.</HI> lib. iii,) part of which I &s;hall here recite, <HI>If we had come into the world in &s;uch circum&s;tances as that we could clearly and di&s;tinctly have di&s;cerned nature her&s;elf, and been able in the cour&s;e of our lives to have follow|ed
<PB N="18" REF="028262_0023_0FD7DB9397B45430">her true and uncorrupted directions; this alone might have been &s;ufficient, and there would have been little need of teaching and in&s;truction. But now na|ture has given us only &s;ome &s;mall &s;parks of right rea|&s;on, which we &s;oon extingui&s;h with corrupt opinions and evil practices, that the true light of nature no where appears. As &s;oon as we are brought into the world, immediately we dwell in the mid&s;t of all wick|edne&s;s.</HI> And then he goes on to &s;hew the influence that our &s;en&s;es and evil examples have upon us, and concludes, that hereby our very natures are transformed as it were into corrupt &s;entiments. Now this being &s;o, the voice of nature or of right rea&s;on, is not heard without extraordinary atten|tion, and &s;uch as the mo&s;t of mankind are unac|quainted with. And indeed what we now call the law of nature, is of &s;o nice a con&s;ideration, and re|quires &s;o much nice ab&s;tract rea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing, that none but men of parts, liberal education, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd great &s;tudy, are capable of deducing the doctrines of it from their fir&s;t principles, and of repre&s;enting them with proper light and evidence. So that con&s;idering the univer&s;al depravity of men's minds, and con|&s;idering the circum&s;tances of the bulk of mankind, it may I think be a&s;&s;erted, that the law and light of nature, would have been a very &s;ufficient rule, and comparatively of little u&s;e to us. We that have the <HI>Bible</HI> to direct us, and the labours of learned men, who have lighted their torch at that &s;un, can talk finely of the law of nature; but with|out that help, very few, I am per&s;uaded, would have had any tolerable notions of it. Which will appear more evidently, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the greate&s;t proficients in &s;tudy, the mo&s;t profound philo&s;ophers, were at a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and at great uncertainty as to &s;ome of the mo&s;t impor|tant doctrines in religion. To repre&s;ent this would require a di&s;cour&s;e by it&s;elf, and therefore you can
<PB N="19" REF="028262_0024_0FD7DB94F41DEB40">expect only a few hints. They were gro&s;sly in the dark as to the foundation of all religion, the being and perfections of God; as appears from their notions of the&s;e matters, and particularly from this, that they allowed a plurality of gods, which is in effect to undermine and de&s;troy all true divinity, and really leave no God. They <HI>wor&s;hipped crea|tures,</HI> be&s;ides, and in&s;tead of <HI>the creator,</HI> as the apo&s;tle charges them, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 25. and <HI>did &s;ervice to them which by nature are no Gods, Gal.</HI> iv. 8. What a rabble of deities they had brought into the world, and honored with &s;acrifices, and all &s;orts of religious rites, I &s;hall not now &s;tand to &s;hew: only take notice, that though &s;ome great men among them laughed at the&s;e &s;uper&s;titions, and contemn|ed in their hearts the ba&s;e and vile deities of the vulgar; yet it was a principle allowed by them, and according to which they them&s;elves practi&s;ed, that all were to comply with the rites e&s;tabli&s;hed in the country where they lived, and wor&s;hip the gods according to the law. So that natural reli|gion as taught by the philo&s;ophers, and univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heathen world, failed in this fun|damental article, the unity of the Godhead, the owning and acknowledging one only living and true God.</P>
<P>Further, they were ignorant of the origin of the world, and maintained opinions on this head ut|terly incon&s;i&s;tent with religion. It was their com|mon maxim, that nothing could be made out of nothing; and con&s;equently, they held that matter was 'uncreated,' and the world &s;elf-exi&s;tent. Some of them thought the world was not made at all, but from eternity, either with or without a deity, and &s;o was God it&s;elf, or with a deity, being co-exi&s;tent with God, and a &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ary ema|nation from him; which is &s;aid to be the opinion

<P>They were equally bewildered in their notions of providence: a numerous &s;ect of the philo&s;o|phers, the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> denied all providence: others, as <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and his &s;chool, confined it to heaven, leaving all human affairs without any &s;u|perintendency of God: others acknowledged a general providence, but denied it extended to par|ticular per&s;ons and their concernment. And even the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;ertors of divine providence, confined it to the more important af|fairs of mankind. Now it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, that &s;uch a doctrine as this, &s;uch principles as ge|nerally, and almo&s;t univer&s;ally, obtained among them on this head, tended not only to le&s;&s;en, but de&s;troy every thing that de&s;erves the name of reli|gion. For why &s;hould we love, fear, tru&s;t, pray to, or wor&s;hip a God that concerns not him&s;elf about us, on whom we do not depend, and who neither doth us good nor evil.</P>
<P>They were equally at a lo&s;s about the <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> the great end and happine&s;s of man. They knew not wherein happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted, and con&s;equently, mu&s;t rove in uncertainties, act and live without any particular aim. Some of them placed happine&s;s in one thing, others in a different; and &s;o &s;trangely were they divided here, that <HI>Varro</HI> reckoned up no le&s;s than two hundred eighty-eight opinions about it.</P>
<P>Nor were they at any certainty about the im|mortality of the &s;oul and a future &s;tate. The greate&s;t part of them were downright <HI>infidels</HI> as to the&s;e points; and the be&s;t of them, after their ut|mo&s;t re&s;earches, fluctuated, lived and died in &s;u&s;|pence. <HI>Socrates,</HI> though he &s;eemed to incline to believe and hope for another world, &s;peaks doubt|fully:

<P>Now, if the great men among the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;tudy the book of nature, and who had carried their inquiries to the highe&s;t, fell into &s;uch errors and mi&s;takes, and at be&s;t were at &s;uch uncertainties; one may ea&s;ily infer, the ca&s;e of the ignorant vulgar would be very deplorable, and that religion among them would be in a mo&s;t wretched &s;tate. I may add,</P>
<P N="3">3. As tho&s;e that cultivated natural religion, and made the greate&s;t improvements in the &s;tudy of it, thus blundered and run into errors in matters of the highe&s;t con&s;equence; &s;o natural light, in its ut|mo&s;t extent, was defective. Suppo&s;ing the law of nature had been under&s;tood better by tho&s;e that &s;tudied it, it is not &s;ufficient to direct men in all the concernments of religion. In two points particu|larly it falls &s;hort, <HI>viz. The right manner of wor&s;hip|ping God, and the terms upon which &s;inners may a&s;|&s;uredly be accepted with him.</HI> Neither of the&s;e two things, which yet are of the utmo&s;t moment to us, doth it di&s;cover with any &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>the right manner of wor|&s;hipping God;</HI> the light of nature could not of it&s;elf be a &s;ufficient direction. I do not ground my argument or proof of this upon the ab&s;urd, cruel, and filthy manner in which generally they wor&s;hip|ped. For, I grant, natural rea&s;on would condemn that; and we find the wi&s;er among the philo&s;ophers, exclaiming again&s;t &s;uch fooleries very freely; how|ever, they fell in with them in practice. <HI>What a frenzy is it to imagine,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Seneca</HI>) <HI>that the Gods can be delighted with &s;uch cruelties, that even the wor&s;t of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> could &s;cruple to authori&s;e or commit.

Nor do I deny, but the philo&s;ophers &s;pake many grave and good things concerning the wor&s;hip of God. The love of him, and obedience to him, they concluded was the mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice, and that a pure heart was infinitely better than all their hecatombs or mo&s;t co&s;tly oblations. But then, as to the particular manner and form of external wor&s;hip, they knew not, neither could the rea&s;on and light of their minds herein direct them. They could not tell, what mode of external &s;ervice would be acceptable to God. And hence, even the greate&s;t of them thought it be&s;t to comply with e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, which they did &s;o as to involve them&s;elves in the guilt of the mo&s;t vile and &s;tupid idolatry.</P>
<P>And then, as to the other point, the terms upon which they might hope for, and have a&s;&s;urance of acceptance with God, and of being received into favor: rea&s;on, or the light of nature could afford them, very little &s;atisfaction. Here their oracle was &s;ilent, and the light of nature utterly failed.</P>
<P>It is con&s;iderable to my purpo&s;e, that the light of nature could not di&s;cover the origin of evil, <HI>whence this evil,</HI> was the great puzzle of their divi|nity; and it would be no great difficulty, to infer hence, that it could not &s;ufficiently direct how to get it removed; at lea&s;t, tho&s;e that had nothing but nature for their direction, were at a mighty lo&s;s as to both the&s;e particulars. Some of them attributed evil to antipathy, a certain quarrel&s;ome principle, which they knew not what to make of. Others to
<PB N="23" REF="028262_0028_0FD7F40E47B7A1B8">the nece&s;&s;ary perver&s;ity of matter. Others to a certain malignant &s;pirit. Though the mo&s;t common opinion was, that there were two Gods, the one the author of all good, and the other, the author of all evil. Now &s;uch confu&s;ion as this, I dare &s;ay, mu&s;t leave them in the dark, to whom, and how to apply for the removal of evil, the pardon of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould they apply to God, the living and true God, as I grant rea&s;on would direct; yet they could not be a&s;&s;ured, that he would be pro|pitious to them, and pa&s;s by their offences. They might indeed infer &s;omething encouraging from the mercy and goodne&s;s of God; might build &s;ome probable hope upon the methods of his providence, the kindne&s;s, and forbearance di&s;covered in the con&s;tant cour&s;e thereof. But yet, there are in&s;u|perable difficulties remaining here, in which natu|ral rea&s;on cannot relieve us. For in&s;tance, as we are &s;inners, as all men mu&s;t own them&s;elves to be, and the heathens univer&s;ally did acknowledge it. We &s;tand expo&s;ed to the ju&s;tice of God, de&s;erve puni&s;hment, and God has a right to puni&s;h us; and I think natural rea&s;on cannot a&s;&s;ure us, he will depart from his right. If it be &s;aid he is mer|ciful, and this rea&s;on di&s;covers; I an&s;wer, it al&s;o di&s;covers, that he is ju&s;t and righteous; and how can we be a&s;&s;ured that he will exerci&s;e mercy again&s;t the demands of ju&s;tice. Should it be &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that rea&s;on may &s;atisfy the &s;inner, that if he repent, &s;o good and gracious a being, as all men believe God to be, will forgive &s;in. I an&s;wer, rea&s;on cannot give any a&s;&s;urance of this. Repen|tance we &s;ee does not &s;atisfy human governors, who, as concerned for the honor of their laws and government, often puni&s;h criminals, notwith&s;tand|ing their repentance, and for ought rea&s;on can tell us, the righteous governor of the world may do &s;o too.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="028262_0029_0FD7F40FAF725CC0">
Further, rea&s;on cannot a&s;&s;ure us, how often God will pardon; whether he will pardon all &s;in; whe|ther he will not only pardon, but receive into fa|vor; how he will pardon, whether ab&s;olutely, or upon what terms. That the heathens were at a lo&s;s as to all the&s;e things, is evident from the &s;hifts they were put to, when under apprehen&s;ion of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure. Witne&s;s their numerous &s;acri|fices, and &s;uper&s;titious rites, their offering the <HI>fruit of their body for the &s;in of their &s;oul,</HI> and the like; which were the means they devi&s;ed for appea&s;ing the anger of the Deity, and rendering him propiti|ous. In &s;hort, the utmo&s;t length that natural light could carry any in this matter, we have I think ex|emplified in the ca&s;e of the Ninevites, <HI>Who can tell if God will repent, and turn away from his fierce an|ger, that we peri&s;h not?</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, they were in &s;o much darkne&s;s about the nature of God, about &s;in, about repent|ance, and the methods of applying to God; they had &s;o much to increa&s;e their fears, as well as encou|rage their hopes; that in the&s;e re&s;pects it mu&s;t be owned, that natural religion, had they attended to its utmo&s;t light, was lame and defective.</P>
<P>It is too &s;oon to infer from hence, the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upernatural revelation; that I &s;hall do with more advantage from all the particulars when I have fini&s;hed them. Only let me ob&s;erve as I pa&s;s on, how great a ble&s;&s;ing we have in the Bible on this account as well as many others. This clearly &s;hews us our di&s;ea&s;e and points out our remedy. This tells us, that <HI>God made man upright,</HI> but that <HI>he &s;ought out many inventions;</HI> and that <HI>God is in Chri&s;t reconciling the world to him&s;elf.</HI> We now know that he will forgive &s;in, having publi&s;hed an act of grace and indemnity from heaven, declaring that if we repent, <HI>our &s;ins &s;hall be blotted out,</HI> that he <HI>will be merciful to our iniquities, and our &s;ins he will
<PB N="25" REF="028262_0030_0FD7F41179B00930">remember no more.</HI> This our Bible is full of. We cannot doubt of it, but have a &s;ure foundation for our faith and hope to re&s;t upon, and are not left to fluctuate in uncertainties, as the Gentiles did that knew not God, nor were acquainted with the di&s;co|veries of the go&s;pel. The Son of God came from heaven to procure this favor, and he left &s;tated of|ficers in commi&s;&s;ion to proclaim it to the world; for &s;o we read that he commanded, that <HI>repentance, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 47. We have rea&s;on therefore to be thank|ful for the Bible, and value it exceedingly. But this will further appear in the progre&s;s of my di&s;|cour&s;e on this &s;ubject. In the mean time to proceed,</P>
<P N="4">4. As it might be probably concluded from the foregoing particulars, that there would be great di&s;order, darkne&s;s and corruption among mankind that wanted a &s;upernatural revelation; &s;o it is evi|dent this was the ca&s;e. The heathen world as they were the regions of darkne&s;s, the dark places of the earth, &s;o among them were the habitations of cruelty. Their minds were wofully depraved, their principles corrupt, and their manners vile and abo|minable. A &s;hort view of the &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, which you will con&s;ider, as the &s;tate of tho&s;e that wanted the advantage of the Bible, will convince you of this. And as it may be of u&s;e to my pre|&s;ent argument, you will not I hope think it unwor|thy of your attention.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid &s;omething, already concerning their principles with reference to religion; by which it appears how defective their notions were. They were ignorant of &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant doctrines; others they &s;o much depraved by a mixture of their own fancies, and in all were at &s;uch uncertainties, that their principles could be of little u&s;e, either as to practice or comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028262_0031_0FD7F41182F464B8">
To &s;hew this, let me briefly compare their faith with that of chri&s;tians, as we have the latter &s;um|med up in an ancient creed, which we call the apo&s;tles, containing the chief doctrines of chri&s;ti|anity. They were &s;o far from believing aright in God the Father Almighty, that the generality of them run into the ab&s;urdity of polythei&s;m, be|lieving there were many Gods. And few of them had any tolerable notion of the Supreme Being, the one true God. They were &s;o far from own|ing him as maker of heaven and earth, that many of them thought that heaven and earth had no maker. And for the re&s;t of their belief, there is an entire cha&s;m and defect. It is all blank in their creed. They knew nothing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his only Son our Lord; of his birth, death, re&s;ur|rection, a&s;cen&s;ion, nothing of the Holy Gho&s;t; the holy catholic church; had no &s;olid principles on which they could ground the hope of forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in; without which even the be&s;t of them mu&s;t live in continual &s;u&s;picion and fear. As for the re&s;urrection of the body, that great article of the chri&s;tian faith and hope, their philo&s;ophers could not reach it, but rejected it as ab&s;urd and ridiculous when propo&s;ed to them. Nor had they any &s;teady belief of the concluding article, the life everla&s;ting. Some hoped there might be another &s;tate after this; others laughed at the notion as weak and groundle&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing men with needle&s;s apprehen&s;ions; and the be&s;t of them were in &s;u&s;|pence between hope and fear. So that, it is evi|dent, if we had wanted our Bible, we had wanted our creed, wanted the&s;e great articles of religion, on which a chri&s;tian founds his faith and comfort, and which have &s;o con&s;tant and powerful an influ|ence on practice: we had known little of God, nothing of Chri&s;t, little of heaven, or the way to it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028262_0032_0FD7F41382508398">
And as their faith, &s;o their wor&s;hip, was &s;adly defective and depraved, as would appear upon a &s;hort view of it, even to amazement. They were mi&s;taken as to the object of religious wor&s;hip. For as they had deified in their own imaginations the vile&s;t creatures, and things, and di&s;tributed the di|vinity among a multitude of fictitious deities; ac|cordingly, to the&s;e they paid their honors, doing <HI>&s;ervice to them that by nature were no gods.</HI> The apo&s;tle tells us, they had <HI>gods many, and lords many.</HI> They had, indeed, multiplied them to a prodigious number, and divided them into various cla&s;&s;es; as cele&s;tial, aerial, terre&s;tial, infernal, hurtful gods, and kind beneficent gods. The &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, were their mo&s;t ancient deities, to which they had added a va&s;t many more, deifying almo&s;t every thing they thought, they had cau&s;e either to love or fear. Their kings and emperors were u&s;ually brought in|to the cla&s;s, and received divine honors. Not to take notice, how much lower the &s;uper&s;tition of the vulgar carried them, wor&s;hipping the vile&s;t things.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wor&s;hipping the vile&s;t things</HI>] As a Cat, or a Plant. For we are told, that the Egyptians in particular wor&s;hipped &s;uch things, and the be&s;t apology or excu&s;e, that can be made for them, is to &s;ay, it was only a civil and political wor&s;hip or regard they paid to the&s;e objects, and had very little of &s;acred or religious in it, even among the vulgar. Hu&s;bandry being the chief employment and way of living among that people, they declared by a law, that all tho&s;e creatures which were of eminent &s;ervice in agriculture, de|&s;troyers of vermin, or upon &s;ome other account in peculiar e&s;teem with them, &s;hould be holy, &s;acred, and inviolable; &s;o that it was death to de&s;troy any of them, either de&s;ignedly, or by accident. For con&s;idering them as in&s;truments of divine providence towards the &s;upport of human life, they treated them as things &s;et apart and &s;acred to that particular u&s;e and purpo&s;e, nor did they con&s;e|crate any thing without &s;uch a view, as Cicero tells us, <HI>Aegyptii nullam belluam, ni&s;i ob aliquam utilitatem quam ex ea caperent, con&s;ecra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> verunt.</HI> De Nat.

Thus vain were they become in their imagination. Let me only ob&s;erve here, that as they wor&s;hipped this confu&s;ed medley of gods, the devil took the ad|vantage of their folly, played upon them and abu&s;ed them by his impo&s;tures, and really drew them to the wor&s;hip of him&s;elf.

<P>And, as this was the common ca&s;e of the gentile world, it was the ca&s;e of the ancient Britons in particular, as hi&s;tory informs us, <Q>They were foul idolaters, &s;aith a learned writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller</HI>'s Church Hi&s;tory; p. 1</NOTE> who mi&s;apply|ing that great truth, that God is in every thing, made every thing God, as trees, rivers, hills, mountains.</Q> He adds, <Q>they wor&s;hipped devils, who&s;e pictures remained in the days of <HI>Gildas,</HI> within and without the decayed walls of their cities, drawn with deformed and ugly faces,</Q> as no doubt they &s;ometimes appeared. Their great godde&s;s was <HI>Diana,</HI> the godde&s;s of the game.

<PB N="31" REF="028262_0036_0FD7F4236FE06C88">I an&s;wer, it is true. But it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered, they were the e&s;tabli&s;hed rites reverenced by the bulk of the people, and even tho&s;e that knew better, gave them countenance by maintain|ing, that the gods were to be wor&s;hipped according to the cu&s;tom and law of every country.</P>
<P>What their morals would be con&s;equent upon &s;uch principles, and &s;uch a manner of wor&s;hip, it is ea&s;y to conjecture; and I &s;hall leave it very much to be infered without deducing the particu|lars. Try them upon the decalogue, and you will find them living down all the duties of it, and de&s;|troying both tables in their avowed practices. I have hinted how ill they can &s;tand examination upon the fir&s;t table, and might &s;hew the &s;ame with reference to the &s;econd.</P>
<P>They gro&s;sly violated the &s;ixth commandment, by authori&s;ing murders in their gladiatory exerci|&s;es, by procuring the abortion of children, by ex|po&s;ing new-born infants, and by laying violent hands on them&s;elves, which they plead for as matter of honor on &s;everal occa&s;ions. They as boldly condemned the &s;eventh commandment by adultery, ince&s;t, &s;odomy, which they allowed, and even brought into their religion as &s;acred rites. <HI>Tully</HI> in a public oration pleads for fornication. They tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the eighth commandment by theft, which many nations gloried in, rather than account|ed it a fault. And the ninth by lying, which their philo&s;ophers recommended as lawful, whenever it might be profitable.</P>
<P>Thus vile and immoral were the heathens, too generally as is evident from their own books and hi&s;torians. And I need not tell you, that the <HI>New Ta&s;tament</HI> con&s;tantly repre&s;ents them in characters agreeable hereunto. See the apo&s;tle's de&s;cription of them in <HI>Rom.</HI> i. from <HI>ver.</HI> 21, to the end of the chapter. He tells us, <HI>God gave them up to unclean|ne&s;s,
<PB N="32" REF="028262_0037_0FD7F4250DB14790">and to vile affections, and a reprobate mind;</HI> the con&s;equence of which was, that they <HI>were filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, fornication, wickedne&s;s, covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s, envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,</HI> with many other defilements of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, there &s;pecified; and in the &s;ame manner the Scripture every where paints them. I &s;hall only mention one pa&s;&s;age thereof more, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 18, 19. where, &s;peaking of the Gentiles, he &s;ays, <HI>their un|der&s;tandings were darkened, being alienated from the life of God;</HI> he adds, <HI>who being pa&s;t feeling, have given them&s;elves over unto la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, to work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s.</HI> This was the general character of the heathen world. They had cor|rupted their notions of God and religion, their un|der&s;tandings were darkened, hearts hardened, and con&s;cience utterly laid wa&s;te. So that their lives were &s;tained with the wor&s;t abominations. In a word, it is in them that de&s;cription we have, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 11, 12. is mo&s;t literally fulfilled and an&s;wered, <HI>there is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God; they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that does good; no not one:</HI> and again, <HI>ver.</HI> 6. <HI>de&s;|truction and mi&s;ery are in their ways.</HI></P>
<P>Now from hence, I think, I may conclude, the propo&s;ition I am upon &s;tands good, <HI>viz.</HI> That a &s;pecial revelation from heaven, was become nece&s;&s;a|ry. You have &s;een the in&s;ufficiency of natural light, have heard &s;ome of the blunders and errors of tho&s;e that cultivated it, the defects in principle, and univer&s;al depravation of wor&s;hip and manners that over&s;pread the heathen world: the con&s;equence from which is exceeding clear, that there needed help and light from heaven to retrieve matters, and to re&s;tore the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the true God.</P>
<P>But here it may be objected, that there were ex|cellent
<PB N="33" REF="028262_0038_0FD7F42679A2B708">men among the philo&s;ophers, who taught divine and noble doctrines, &s;ufficient to reform the world, and heal the di&s;tempers of it, had they been attended to. Chri&s;tian divines often borrow from them, embelli&s;h their di&s;cour&s;es with their &s;ayings, quoting their writings with great applau&s;e. In an&s;wer to this, I grant there were. <HI>Socrates,</HI> for in&s;tance, &s;eems to be pre&s;erved, like <HI>Noah</HI> in the old world, in the mid&s;t of a deluge of immorality. Some &s;uch there were, but few, here and there one in an age, that overcame vulgar prejudices, and gave them&s;elves up to the conduct of nature's light, without &s;uffering them&s;elves to be bla&s;&s;ed with their pa&s;&s;ions. A <HI>Socrates</HI> in one age, a <HI>Tully</HI> in another, a <HI>Seneca</HI> or an <HI>Antonine</HI> in another. But as the&s;e were over-numbered by libertine philo&s;o|phers and poets, who &s;pread the poi&s;on among the people; &s;o the notions, principles, and religion of the country was again&s;t them. <HI>Socrates</HI> lo&s;t his life for &s;tanding up for that fundamental point of all religion, the unity of the godhead. Be&s;ides, even the&s;e few great men labored under the defects, I before-mentioned. They could not attain to any true &s;cheme of divinity. They were at an uncer|tainty, as to &s;ome of the more important articles of faith, the immortality of the &s;oul, a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And even their morality was far from being complete. They have not &s;o much as a name for the great chri&s;tian grace of humility: what we call &s;o, pa&s;&s;ed with them for abjectne&s;s, lowne&s;s and littlene&s;s of mind. And their pure&s;t morals had a dangerous mixture: &s;elf-&s;ufficience, pride, and revenge, were not only allow|ed, but accounted, a &s;ort of virtue with them. There were great blemi&s;hes in the lives of their be&s;t men. <HI>Socrates</HI> had his <HI>Noevi:</HI> he did not wholly ab&s;tain from idolatry, nor from a regard to the heathen oracles.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028262_0039_0FD7F428A09362D0">
I will only add, that how great and excellent &s;o|ever the&s;e men were, and how excellent &s;oever their writings; they wanted authority, they were too few to be much heard, too weak to &s;tem the tide. This they them&s;elves &s;aw, and &s;ome of them are &s;aid to have declared their apprehen&s;ions, that without a divine and &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance, no con&s;iderable reformation was ever like to be wrought in the world; that their rea&s;onings and philo&s;ophy would not do, unle&s;s god appeared from heaven, and in a divine manner influenced the hearts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The general prevailing noti|ons were exceeding corrupt: idolatry was e&s;tab|li&s;hed; the public rites of their religious wor&s;hip were &s;candalous and lewd; and they found by ex|perience, that their philo&s;ophy was too feeble to &s;ubdue &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions and head&s;trong lu&s;ts, to per|&s;uade men to renounce their fal&s;e gods, and fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and pur&s;ue the maxims of rea&s;on and vir|tue. This they them&s;elves were convinced of, (&s;ome few among them I mean) wherein they own|ed a great truth that ought always to be in reputa|tion with chri&s;tians, <HI>viz,</HI> that &s;upernatural help, or what we call grace, is nece&s;&s;ary to change the hearts and reform the manners of men.</P>
<P>It may further be objected, that many of tho&s;e that receive and profe&s;s the chri&s;tian religion, are as Sad as the poor Pagans: that as the Jews of old were exceeding vicious, notwith&s;tanding they enjoyed a revelation from heaven, &s;o there are multitudes even among chri&s;tians them&s;elves as &s;candalous in their practice, as the heathens were. I mu&s;t confe&s;s this is an objection that may be urged too plau&s;ibly, and give occa&s;ion to take up the apo&s;tle's complaint in his days, <HI>The name of God is bla&s;phemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding, there is no force in the argument, if it be offered to prove, that a di|vine
<PB N="35" REF="028262_0040_0FD7F42CEFD9C180">revelation is not nece&s;&s;ary, or that it is of no u&s;e; that the world needs it not, or has been no better for it. For as to the Jews, it is utterly fal&s;e, that they were generally as bad as their heathen neighbors. It is granted they often apo&s;tatized, and were &s;everely puni&s;hed on that account. Yet I think it highly probable, that they knew more of God, and practiced more of religion, than all the world be&s;ides. Even when things were wor&s;t with them, they had many eminent and great men, a|mong the lower &s;ort, that pre&s;erved their veneration for God and religion. But, as the objection more peculiarly concerns chri&s;tians, &s;everal things might be &s;aid to it: as, that there are great numbers that u&s;urp the name of chri&s;tians, and live in the chri&s;|tian church, who yet really are no chri&s;tians, can &s;carce be &s;aid to receive the Bible. If they have a Bible in their hou&s;e they &s;eldom look into it, and make no other u&s;e of it, than to cavil at a few pa&s;|&s;ages that fall in their way. And no wonder, that &s;uch are not reformed and bettered by divine re|velation, when they have &s;o little regard to it. But then, as the chri&s;tian church ju&s;tly di&s;owns them, at lea&s;t the head of it doth, and will do &s;o at la&s;t, their behaviour ought not to be turned to the reproach of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>He is not a Jew that is one outwardly:</HI> every man that was bapti&s;ed, by the care and procurement of his parents, is not therefore a chri&s;tian, he might as well be called a Mahometan, a Pagan, did he not live in a chri&s;tian country. I an&s;wer further, that where the chri&s;tian revelation is received to purpo&s;e, it has glorious effects; enlight|ening, transforming, and making a beautiful change in the &s;tate of things, which was &s;een eminently in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity. The reformation the go&s;pel wrought in the lives of its profe&s;&s;ors was &s;o remarkable, that their heathen neighbors &s;tood
<PB N="36" REF="028262_0041_0FD7F42DDDC51800">amazed at it. Once more, con&s;ider the chri&s;tian church under all its di&s;advantages from the infir|mities of good men, and the &s;candals given by hy|pocrites, and there is no compari&s;on between that and the Pagan world. Not, but there are &s;ome called chri&s;tians, as vile and every way as bad, as any of the heathens were, but the main body of chri&s;tians are another &s;ort of per&s;ons, they have not only better principles but they practi&s;e better; the bad among them are not &s;o bad, do not run to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot, and the good among them are far better.</P>
<P>So that, I think, I may &s;till adhere to the propo|&s;ition I laid down, that the &s;tate of mankind requir|ed a &s;upernatural revelation; that this was nece&s;&s;a|ry to relieve them amid&s;t their prevailing darkne&s;s and depravity. Nor can it be &s;aid, that it hath not this tendency, or where it is truly received, has not this effect, in &s;ome mea&s;ure. I go on now to ano|ther propo&s;ition, which I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon but briefly.</P>
<P N="6">6. That it is rea&s;onable to expect God &s;hould give &s;uch a revelation. How much this was want|ed you have heard; and that we might expect it may be proved. I &s;hall only offer two things for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It may be argued, with &s;ome probability, from the attributes of God. His mercy is &s;uch as would incline him to pity his creatures in their deplora|ble circum&s;tances, groaping after him in the dark, and led captive by the devil. His wi&s;dom al&s;o encourages the expectation. By the fall, man was &s;o di&s;abled, and by a cour&s;e of &s;in, the world was become &s;o degenerate, a mere ma&s;s of dark|ne&s;s and corruption; that had not God interpo&s;ed, I cannot &s;ee but this part of the creation mu&s;t have been lo&s;t to all the purpo&s;es of religion: all inter|cour&s;e between God and man mu&s;t have been cut
<PB N="37" REF="028262_0042_0FD7F4330D734C60">off, at lea&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure; God mu&s;t have abandoned man, and man mu&s;t have lived without God in the world. Now God's gracious purpo&s;e of redemption being &s;uppo&s;ed, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to expect there &s;hould be a revelation from him, enabling man to an&s;wer the ends of his creation, to teach him his duty, fit him to fill his place a|mong the creatures, and prepare him to receive the ble&s;&s;ings intended through a redeemer. And ac|cordingly,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Some of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t men among the heathens had &s;uch an expectation. Thus <HI>Socra|tes</HI> is brought in by <HI>Plato,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing his &s;en&s;e that they wanted a divine revelation; and therefore, having taken notice of the uncertainty they were at, as to &s;ome things, after their utmo&s;t inquiries, he tells his di&s;ciples, that he thought it be&s;t to wait patiently till &s;uch a time, as they &s;hould learn cer|tainly, how they ought to behave them&s;elves to|wards God and towards man; and then, after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject, he intimates his apprehen&s;ion, that a divine per&s;on will appear and take the mi&s;t from before their eyes. This is men|tioned by &s;ome,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clark</HI> of natural and revealed religion, <HI>p.</HI> 203.</NOTE> and I think ju&s;tly, as a mo&s;t won|derful pa&s;&s;age, and what looks like a hint, to that celebrated philo&s;opher, of the go&s;pel revelation. All the u&s;e I make of it is this, that as the world exceedingly needed a revelation; &s;o it is evident hence, that one of their greate&s;t men, the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t among them, had a conviction that they needed it. He &s;aw they were plunged in difficul|ties, and could not find the way to extricate them|&s;elves, could not attain to a clearne&s;s and certainty in things; and therefore, as he found the nece&s;&s;ity of it, &s;o he had a pre&s;age in his own mind, I do not know but it might be from heaven, that God would
<PB N="38" REF="028262_0043_0FD7F435C3974408">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> time or other, in an extraordinary manner re|lieve them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thus I have advanced pretty far towards the main point de&s;igned, and &s;hall only &s;ubjoin here one propo&s;ition more.</P>
<P N="7">7. Suppo&s;ing it rea&s;onable to expect a revelation from God, and that there is &s;uch a thing in the world, I think it certain our Bible mu&s;t be that re|velation. Two con&s;iderations will &s;upport this propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no other book that pretends to be a revelation from God, that can have an equal claim to be &s;o, or that &s;o well de&s;erves to be re|ceived as &s;uch. As to the books of nature, or na|tural law, I have already &s;aid the Bible doth not exclude that. The Scriptures contain nothing con|trary to natural religion, but compri&s;e it, explain, and improve it; they take in all that is valuable and truly deduced from the principles of rea&s;on, among the philo&s;ophers. So that there needs be no oppo&s;ition between the one and the other. If philo&s;ophy be &s;et up as a competitor with the Bible, you have heard how very defective it is, and enough I think has been &s;aid to di&s;grace its pretences.</P>
<P>As to the books of Mo&s;es, they are a part of Scripture revelation. There remains therefore, but one book more of any account in the world, that can be called a competitor, and that is the <HI>Al|coran,</HI> the Bible or pretended revelation of <HI>Maho|met</HI> and his followers. And if the que&s;tion be, whether that, or the chri&s;tian Bible, be truly a re|velation from heaven? we need but compare them together, and it will be ea&s;y to make a judgment. Concerning the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> let me remark a few things without enlargement: as that what is valuable in it, is generally taken from our Bible; and then it is, for the greate&s;t part of it, &s;uch a jargon, a mix|ture of incoherent non&s;en&s;e as renders it unworthy
<PB N="39" REF="028262_0044_0FD7F4371168BDC8">of a wi&s;e man, much more of the infinitely wi&s;e God. Be&s;ides, there are a great many direct con|tradictions in it, one revelation incon&s;i&s;tent with another, laws given, and then revoked, ju&s;t as occa|&s;ion required; which &s;how, it could not be by di|vine in&s;piration. Further, it propo&s;es an heaven of &s;en&s;ual delights, which it neither becomes man to expect, nor God to promi&s;e. And in &s;hort, all its &s;ucce&s;s and progre&s;s in the world, is owing to the &s;word and outward violance; which certainly are characters that &s;ufficiently di&s;parage it. It follows therefore, either that the Bible is a revela|tion from God, or there is no &s;uch thing in the world. To which let me add,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Bible is a revelation, every way worthy of God; &s;uch as we might expect, &s;uppo&s;|ing God &s;hould afford mankind &s;o great a favor as a &s;upernatural revelation. My time is gone, and I have, it may be, &s;taid long enough on the&s;e things; or I might let you &s;ee the &s;everal general characters of this revelation, which would make it at lea&s;t probable that it is from God. Let me only ju&s;t mention &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>It comprehends, as I &s;aid before, all that is ex|cellent in the books of the moral philo&s;ophers. They have indeed their enlargements, their fine &s;ayings, and ornaments, which are not to be found in the &s;ame form in the Bible. But there is no moral law or duty, no nece&s;&s;ary rule of life and practice, in any of them, but the Bible takes it in. Not to &s;ay, that as it delivers all with greater au|thority, &s;o it enforces all with higher motives and arguments.</P>
<P>It corrects the mi&s;takes of the philo&s;ophers, blots out their errata. It delivers the precepts of uni|ver&s;al benevolence and love, without re&s;training that affection as they did to friends only. It re|commends ju&s;tice and charity, without admitting
<PB N="40" REF="028262_0045_0FD7F4385AE75440">revenge. In a word, it contains the law of right rea&s;on in a more correct edition than is to be found el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Again, it &s;upplies the defects of natural religion, and particularly, as it is delivered to us in the books of the profe&s;&s;ed &s;tudents thereof, the philo|&s;ophers. And here, as a conclu&s;ion to this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention &s;ome points of no &s;mall con&s;e|quence, wherein the philo&s;ophers of the heathen world were at a lo&s;s, and in which our Bible gives us abundant &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It makes known the great object of all religious wor&s;hip; a&s;&s;ures us there is a God, and that there is but one God.</P>
<P>It gives us ju&s;t notions of this God, &s;ets him forth in the &s;everal perfections of his nature; as a &s;pirit of infinite power, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, every where pre&s;ent, unchangeable, and eternal. Now as &s;ome of the heathens were gro&s;sly ignorant of both the&s;e points, &s;o others knew them but very imperfectly; and yet all acceptable wor&s;hip, all true religion, depends on them.</P>
<P>The Bible gives us a clear, &s;atisfying di&s;covery of the origin of the world, and of all things in it. The fir&s;t ver&s;e of the Bible tells us more than we can learn from all the writings of Plato and Ari&s;to|tle, and the other wi&s;e men of old: <HI>In the begin|ning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It a&s;&s;erts the doctrine of divine providence in the full extent of it, and lets us know that the &s;ame power and wi&s;dom that made the world, con&s;tantly upholds and governs it; watching over all crea|tures, and &s;uperintending their affairs.</P>
<P>It informs us of the ri&s;e of evil in the world, which was the great problem of heathen divinity, that about which they could never come to any cer|tainty; acquainting us, that the fir&s;t man &s;inning again&s;t God, corrupted the human nature, and
<PB N="41" REF="028262_0046_0FD7F43BA24423F8">hence the fountain being defiled, the &s;treams that i&s;&s;ue from it are defiled al&s;o.</P>
<P>It reveals the great de&s;ign of God, and the &s;cheme for the re&s;toration and recovery of guilty, lo&s;t man. It &s;ets forth a &s;aviour, and proclaims reconciliation in his blood: a point of the highe&s;t u&s;e and com|fort to mankind; and yet not one word of it in nature, or in the books of the philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>It provides &s;upernatural help for us in the di&s;|charge of all our duties. This it doth by the pro|mi&s;e of the holy &s;pirit. The heathens, as I have hinted, were convinced of their wants and nece&s;|&s;ity here, but knew nothing of a remedy.</P>
<P>It calls men up to a divine, &s;piritual intercour&s;e and conver&s;e with God, as the life and comfort of their minds. Indeed here lies the true &s;ecret of religion; for which all moral duties and acts of wor&s;hip fit us, and thereby prepare us for heaven. And how little the heathens knew of this by the light of nature, I need not &s;ay.</P>
<P>The Bible is full of glorious promi&s;es &s;uited to a chri&s;tian in all the varieties of his ca&s;e. And I add to all the re&s;t, it gives him a&s;&s;urance of a future &s;tate of immortality and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e are points of the utmo&s;t import|ance to us, and of the highe&s;t con&s;olation; points in which natural religion, and the writings of the philo&s;ophers, leave us in the dark, and at a lo&s;s; but wherein our Bible gives us full certainty; they &s;hould, methinks, &s;erve to recommend it to us as mo&s;t likely to be a revelation from God. I do not &s;ay, they ab&s;olutely prove it to be &s;o; but they may prepare us for the belief of this truth, which is all I intend by them, making it manife&s;t, that it is &s;uch a revelation as we wanted, and had rea&s;on to expect.</P>

<ITEM>1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other
<PB N="44" REF="028262_0048_0FD7F440F77BE738">ancient hi&s;tory; and con&s;equently, if it be not true, we have no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to receive and believe any ancient book in the world.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That our Bi|ble has greater marks of credibility than any other ancient book. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the circum&s;tances of it con&s;idered, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be true.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient book; I do not &s;ay, it has not a &s;u|perior credit. I &s;hall endeavor to prove by and by that it has. But it is enough for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to claim an equal credit in behalf of the Bible. And what I a&s;&s;ert, is, that nothing can be &s;aid for any ancient book, any hi&s;tory wrote before our time, (whether more or le&s;s ancient is not ma|terial) but the &s;ame may be &s;aid for the Bible; nor any thing objected again&s;t the Bible, as to the truth of it, but the &s;ame may be urged as &s;trongly again&s;t that ancient hi&s;tory, whatever it is. So that if there be &s;ufficient rea&s;on to receive and believe any an|cient hi&s;tory; for in&s;tance, <HI>Thucydides, Plutarch, Livy,</HI> or <HI>Tacitus:</HI> to believe that the&s;e books were wrote by the per&s;ons who&s;e names they bear, and to whom they are a&s;cribed, and to believe the facts they relate; there is as good rea&s;on to receive the Bible, to believe the &s;everal books of it were wrote by &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons who pa&s;s for the writers of them, and to believe the account of things they give, to be genuine and true. This I dare under|take to prove; and con&s;equently, that no man can reject the Bible under pretence that it wants evi|dence; but he mu&s;t at the &s;ame time reject all other ancient Books, and turn a perfect <HI>Sceptic</HI> and unbeliever with re&s;pect to all hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>That this may appear, let us examine upon what evidence, what principles and motives, we receive and believe any ancient books or hi&s;tories. And you will allow me to &s;ugge&s;t here &s;omething in the
<PB N="45" REF="028262_0049_0FD7F4433237C238">negative, to hint what is not nece&s;&s;ary in the evi|dence, and what cannot be thought an objection again&s;t them: as</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that we our&s;elves &s;aw the things done which we are to believe. In this ca&s;e, there would be no proper believing; for faith or believing, is, an a&s;&s;ent upon the te&s;timony; and what a man &s;ees, he does not receive upon the te&s;timony of another, but he knows it by means of his own &s;en&s;es. Nor could we believe any thing that was tran&s;acted before our own time, or at which we were not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;ee the hi&s;to|rian write his book, and put his own name to it. For if this was requi&s;ite, there are few or no hi&s;to|ries in the world, not to &s;ay of ancient times, but even of our own, that we could be capable of be|lieving.</P>
<P>I the rather mention this to &s;trike at an objection, that I am afraid is lurking in the minds of many, and is at the bottom of their infidelity, though they may not &s;peak out. They never &s;aw <HI>Mo&s;es, Chri&s;t,</HI> nor the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> for in&s;tance, how do they know there were &s;uch per&s;ons? and that they did or wrote &s;uch things? but I a&s;k, did you ever &s;ee <HI>A|lexander, Julius Cae&s;ar, Pompey,</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> VIII of <HI>England?</HI> and yet do you not believe that there were &s;uch per&s;ons? he that doth not believe there were &s;uch per&s;ons becau&s;e he never &s;aw them, has &s;o far laid a&s;ide the nature of man, that he is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ble of being dealt with in a rea&s;onable way. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he doth believe, though he never &s;aw them, then the not &s;eeing <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> can be no rea|&s;on again&s;t the believing the Scripture account of them, that there were &s;uch per&s;ons, and did &s;uch things.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould it be any objection again&s;t believ|ing an ancient hi&s;tory, that there have been, and
<PB N="46" REF="028262_0050_0FD7F444728F8310">are &s;ome fal&s;e hi&s;tories in the world. There are cheats and impo&s;tors we know; but it doth not thence follow, that there are no hone&s;t men. There is a great deal of trick and juggle, a great deal of fal&s;hood and knavery in the world; but I hope notwith&s;tanding, that there is &s;ome &s;incerity and truth; otherwi&s;e, all mutual confidence and tru&s;t would be de&s;troyed, there would be no con|ver&s;ing together, &s;ociety mu&s;t di&s;band and break up and mankind either live &s;eparate, or put them|&s;elves into a &s;tate of war; look upon every body as an enemy, and arm for &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as bad as the world is, there always have been, and will be &s;ome upright, hone&s;t men. While God continues the human race and his go|vernment over mankind, he will pre&s;erve &s;ome de|gree of ju&s;tice, fidelity, and truth &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the being and order of &s;ociety. The pretence therefore, that there have been fal&s;e hi&s;tories, only bids us be cautious what hi&s;tories we receive, but not that we receive none, according to the apo&s;tle's admonition in another ca&s;e, <HI>Beloved, believe not eve|ry &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they are of God; becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets are gone out into the world.</HI> There are many fal&s;e hi&s;tories and fal&s;e men: we &s;hould therefore try them before we believe them. But as this does not prove there are no true hi&s;to|ries, and no hone&s;t men on whom we may with &s;afety depend; &s;o it is no argument again&s;t giving credit to &s;uch. Nor.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it nece&s;&s;ary in order to believe an ancient hi&s;tory or ancient book to be true, that it &s;hould be impo&s;&s;ible for it to be fal&s;e. To expect this is the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable thing in the world. We do not go upon &s;uch evidence in other matters, but be|lieve and tru&s;t without &s;uch high &s;ecurity. All trade and commerce proceeds upon probabilities, and what we call moral certainty. The merchant
<PB N="47" REF="028262_0051_0FD7F4462A8E0EE8">believes there are &s;uch and &s;uch places in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies. It is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may be mi&s;taken. But the concurring te&s;timony of &s;o many per&s;ons, gives &s;o &s;trong a moral evidence, that he cannot rea&s;onably que&s;tion it. Men depend on their &s;ervants, on their fidelity and hone&s;ty, and often they them&s;elves, and all they have in the world, are in their power. They put their lives in the hands of their phy&s;ician, and even of their bar|ber. There is no impo&s;&s;ibility in it but they may be undone in all the&s;e dependencies; and yet that is no argument again&s;t &s;uch tru&s;ts, or for being un|ea&s;y therein. It is po&s;&s;ible any mor&s;el of meat you take may poi&s;on you: but we do not ab&s;tain from eating for all that; it is enough that there is a great deal of whole&s;ome food, and we have no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect what we take, though it is po&s;&s;ible it may be pernicious. In a word, as it is the part of a pru|dent man not to believe a thing purely becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible to be true, &s;o it is equally his part not to reject any thing becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible it may be fal&s;e. We are to con&s;ider the probabilities of things, the evidences they have, what evidences are to be ex|pected, what they are capable of, and &s;hould be thought &s;ufficient: For as it is folly and ra&s;hne&s;s to believe without proper and &s;ufficient evidence, &s;o it is unrea&s;onable not to believe with it, or when we have it. It is po&s;&s;ible this or that book or hi&s;tory may be fal&s;e, that any book or hi&s;tory may be &s;o; but then I &s;ay, if we will exerci&s;e no faith, no tru&s;t, no dependence but where it is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be mi&s;taken; we mu&s;t believe nothing, tru&s;t no body, we mu&s;t con|ver&s;e with mankind no more; but withdraw from the world, or at lea&s;t live in continual jealou&s;y and fear.</P>
<P>I would not have this thought impertinent or a digre&s;&s;ion. I apprehend it to be full to my pur|po&s;e:
<PB N="48" REF="028262_0052_0FD7F44C96FF5828">nor would it appear any great difficulty to prove that mo&s;t of the objections of our dei&s;ts and cavillers at Scripture turn upon this. I do not &s;ay they make this a formal objection; but I am per|&s;uaded, if they would examine their own minds, and inquire what it is that &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cks with them, it would be found this is all that remains to keep their infideli|ty in countenance. They may have learned to flouri&s;h a little upon other topics of raillery; but pu&s;h them home and this will be their la&s;t re&s;ort. They cannot pretend to prove the Bible is fal&s;e, or that they can demon&s;trate it to be &s;o, nor pretend that they have le&s;s evidence of it, than of other books which yet they believe. But their eva&s;ion is this, the&s;e things were done a great while ago, we neither &s;aw nor knew any thing of them; they may be &s;o, but they may be otherwi&s;e; and we ought to have good proof before we give our faith to we know not what. I fear this is the ca&s;e of a great many among us, that call in que&s;tion the Bible. But how unrea&s;onable their cavil is, appears from what has been &s;aid. The que&s;tion concerning the Bible, or any other book, is not, whether it is po&s;|&s;ible it may be fal&s;e; but whether we have &s;uffici|ent rea&s;on to believe it is true. If &s;o, certainly our unbelievers mu&s;t be highly faulty, who &s;o boldly reject it; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the weight and con&s;equence of the things it propo&s;es. And they are the more inexcu&s;able here becau&s;e they do it upon a pretence that will de&s;troy the credit of all hi&s;tory in the world, turn mankind into <HI>Sceptics,</HI> make them di&s;tru&s;t one another, and di&s;tru&s;t them|&s;elves too in every thing.</P>
<P>But to go back to my point, my argument is, that we have equal evidence that the Bible is true, as that there is any true hi&s;tory in the world; or that any other ancient book or hi&s;tory is true. And that this may appear, I told you we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;t inquire
<PB N="49" REF="028262_0053_0FD7F44E05497460">upon what evidence we receive an ancient hi&s;tory, what evidence is &s;ufficient to make it pa&s;s, and ac|tually doth make it pa&s;s current, as a true and good hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And I reckon the credit of ancient books de|pends upon &s;uch things as the&s;e,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the per&s;ons, who wrote them, had &s;uf|ficient knowledge of the things they wrote.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they were men of integrity. The for|mer &s;hows they were not deceived, and this that they would not deceive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they wrote at the very time when the facts, they relate, are &s;aid to be done, and might be known, publicly known, to be done.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That their account of things be confirmed by the co-temporary writers of good credit, by per&s;ons that lived at the &s;ame time and had &s;uffici|ent opportunity to know the facts recorded in the hi&s;tory. I add,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Any ancient book or hi&s;tory receives a migh|ty confirmation if it treats of &s;ubjects of great im|portance, in which the intere&s;ts of mankind are highly concerned or at lea&s;t of a part of mankind: &s;o that as it would be carefully examined by others, it was not contradicted by any, but in the main facts of it owned and acknowledged by all.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Were it proper to enlarge on the &s;ubject in this place, I could &s;how that the&s;e are the characters and principles upon which the credit of all our an|cient books &s;tands. But as this would carry me into a long di&s;cour&s;e, which many of you would account unprofitable &s;peculation, of how great im|portance &s;oever it may be, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent omit it and in&s;tead of that &s;hall immediately apply my&s;elf to the point before us, &s;hall illu&s;trate the &s;everal particulars I have mentioned, in the in&s;tances of the Bible; &s;how that they all belong to it, and con&s;equently, that we have rea&s;on to receive it, as
<PB N="50" REF="028262_0054_0FD7F44F5073AF68">a true hi&s;tory, a faithful record of things; which is all I am at pre&s;ent contending for. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Bible was wrote, by per&s;ons that had &s;uf|ficient opportunity, of being fully informed, con|cerning the things they report; and who could not but know them. A learned man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stilling &s;le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Originae Sacrae.</NOTE> in a celebrated performance, has abundantly proved this, concern|ing <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who has given us the hi&s;tory of the ori|gin of the world, the fall of man, the promi&s;e of a &s;aviour, the beginning of a church, and the fir&s;t in|&s;titutes and main doctrines of religion. This is a con&s;iderable part of the Bible, and contains an hi&s;tory of about 2500 years, and is the foundation of all the re&s;t. And how excellently <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was qualified to write this hi&s;tory, the author I refer to has &s;hown at large. His in&s;piration, which we chri&s;tians believe, and of which we have the &s;tronge&s;t evidence, removes all difficulties at once. But &s;etting that a&s;ide, and con&s;ider him only as a common hi&s;torian, he had a very exact intelligence of the things he relates, and &s;uch as would enable him to write of them in as authentic a manner as any other common hi&s;torian in the world.</P>
<P>As to the four la&s;t books that go under his name, the hi&s;tories of <HI>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deute|ronomy,</HI> he him&s;elf was an actor in all, and had the chief management of affairs as lawgiver and ruler; every thing was done under his eye and cognizance. So that this part of the hi&s;tory, excepting the la&s;t chapter of the la&s;t book, which gives the &s;tory of his death, may be fitly called the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es's life and times.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t book, that of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> he might learn the contents of it from tradition, which as the piety and intere&s;t of the fir&s;t patriarchs obliged them to pre&s;erve pure and uncorrupt, &s;o their long
<PB N="51" REF="028262_0055_0FD7F4515521F150">lives enabled them to do it. All the&s;e facts pa&s;&s;ed but through a few hands, and could not well be mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;repre&s;ented. For in&s;tance, can we imagine that the grand-children of <HI>Jacob</HI> could be ignorant of the affairs of their family, of their pedigree, and whence they came into <HI>Egypt?</HI> can we imagine a thing &s;o remarkable, which was attended with &s;o many memorable circum&s;tances, e&s;pecially the &s;elling of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> &s;hould be forgotten in &s;o little a time? Could <HI>Jacob,</HI> the father of the&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites, Mo&s;es</HI> conver&s;ed with, be ignorant of the country whence his grand-father <HI>Abraham</HI> came, e&s;pecially when he him&s;elf married into the coun|try, and lived &s;o long there in <HI>Laban's</HI> family? could <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he was co-temporary with <HI>Shem,</HI> be ignorant of the truth of the flood, when <HI>Shem</HI> from whom he de&s;cended, was one of the per|&s;ons pre&s;erved in the ark? and can we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Shem</HI> ignorant of the tran&s;actions before the flood, when he was born near 100 years before the death of <HI>Methu&s;elah,</HI> who lived a con&s;iderable part of his time with <HI>Adam?</HI> So that the knowledge of the&s;e things would ea&s;ily be conveyed down to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> For as <HI>Adam</HI> might carry it down to <HI>Methu&s;elah,</HI> and <HI>Methu&s;elah</HI> to <HI>Shem,</HI> &s;o it is likely <HI>Shem</HI> lived &s;ome part of <HI>Jacob's</HI> time, at lea&s;t of <HI>I&s;aac's.</HI> And how &s;hort and ea&s;y the pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch things in the hands of &s;uch men, from <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> any one may collect.</P>
<P>Let me further remark here, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a per&s;on of great wi&s;dom, judgment and experience, capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing truth from fal&s;hood, real|ity from impo&s;ture. He was this way at lea&s;t, as well qualified as any other writer. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> are famed for their learning in all ancient books. They were indeed, the great &s;ource of learning from whence other nations derived theirs. Now
<PB N="52" REF="028262_0056_0FD7F4635CD6C830">the Scripture gives this account of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that as he was brought up in <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> court, &s;o he was &s;killed and <HI>learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians,</HI> Acts vii. 22. It is likely he was eminent for his natural and political knowledge. He lived and conver&s;ed with the mo&s;t eminent men, it is proba|ble, of every profe&s;&s;ion; and that he did not ne|glect the opportunities he had of improving him|&s;elf, the text I mentioned witne&s;&s;es, which &s;ays, he was <HI>learned in all their wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>The u&s;e I would make of this con&s;ideration is, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was not like to be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon. If you allow him to be hone&s;t and upright, as to which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething pre&s;ently, there is no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him credulous, and that he would publi&s;h any thing, the truth of which he had not rea&s;on to know or believe. For in&s;tance, had there been any thing ab&s;urd and repugnant to rea&s;on, in the hi&s;tory of the creation, of the fall of man, the flood, the dimen&s;ions of the ark, and the like: &s;uch a per&s;on as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would not have publi&s;hed them in the manner he doth. He was a wi&s;e and learned man, of far greater capacity to know and judge of the&s;e things, I do not &s;ay than the poor little ca|villers of our age, but than mo&s;t men ever &s;ince of any age.</P>
<P>So that it is evident, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> who wrote one con&s;i|derable part of our Bible, had this fir&s;t qualificati|on of a good hi&s;torian in an extraordinary manner. He did not write of things he under&s;tood not, and of which he had not a &s;ufficient knowledge.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious in &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e to go through the <HI>Prophets</HI> and the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> the writers of the other hi&s;torical and poetical books of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament.</HI> Otherwi&s;e, &s;uch an account might be given of their acquaintance with the materials they publi&s;hed as would be &s;atisfactory to mode&s;t, rea&s;onable men.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="028262_0057_0FD7F465E0BE0CB0">
But I pa&s;s to the writers of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> the apo&s;tles and evangeli&s;ts, in who&s;e writings are contained the doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion; and in the hi&s;torical part of them the facts upon which the whole of chri&s;tianity is founded. Now though they had not the learning of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> they had the qualification I am in&s;i&s;ting upon, as nece&s;&s;ary in an hi&s;torian, <HI>viz.</HI> a particular acquaintance with the things they wrote. St. <HI>Luke</HI> owns this in the preface to his go&s;pel, <HI>Luke i.</HI> 1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>Fora&s;|much as many have taken in hand to &s;et forth in order, a declaration of tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly believed among&s;t us; even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witne&s;&s;es, and mini&s;ters of the word:</HI> he adds, <HI>It &s;eemeth good to me al&s;o, having had perfect under&s;tanding of all things from the very fir&s;t, to write to thee in order, mo&s;t ex|cellent Theophilus, &amp;c.</HI> They did not write with|out a perfect under&s;tanding of the things they relat|ed, as he there intimates; nor could they want this when they were eye-witne&s;&s;es of all that pa&s;&s;ed. That they were &s;o is plain, &s;ince we find it in&s;i&s;ted upon as a nece&s;&s;ary part of an apo&s;tle's character, that he mu&s;t have conver&s;ed with Chri&s;t. <HI>Am not I an apo&s;tle? have I not &s;een Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord?</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 1. he was <HI>born out of due time,</HI> as he tells us, had not &s;een Chri&s;t on earth; and therefore to &s;upply that defect, Chri&s;t appeared to him in heaven. The apo&s;tles were not only &s;elect men, cho&s;en of God; but were eye-witne&s;&s;es of the maje&s;ty of Chri&s;t, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 16. <HI>They had heard and &s;een, had looked upon, and their hands had handled the word of life,</HI> The great &s;ub|ject of their te&s;timony, 1 <HI>John.</HI> i. 1.2. This I &s;ay was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, and therefore when <HI>Ju|das's</HI> place was to be filled up, one mu&s;t be cho&s;en that had <HI>accompanied with them all the time that Je|&s;us went in and out among them,</HI> Acts i. 21. An
<PB N="54" REF="028262_0058_0FD7DAAF8486FB38">apo&s;tle was a witne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and that he might be a&s;&s;ured of the matters he was to te&s;tify, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould per&s;onally conver&s;e with Chri&s;t, hear his doctrine, &s;ee his miracles, and have a &s;en|&s;ible evidence of the truth of all he was to bear witne&s;s of.</P>
<P>It would add &s;ome &s;trength to this &s;hould I &s;hew you, what is exceeding evident concerning them, that the&s;e per&s;ons were &s;o far from being credu|lous, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they were with difficulty brought to be|lieve &s;ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral of the main articles of their doctrine and te&s;timony. They could not tell how to be re|conciled to the notion of their ma&s;ter's death, and could &s;carce be per&s;uaded of his re&s;urrection. Thus it is &s;aid, when he appeared to them after his re&s;urrection <HI>that they believed not,</HI> Luke xxiv. 41. They believed not till he <HI>opened their under&s;tand|ing, that they might under&s;tand the Scriptures.</HI> And you read of <HI>Thomas</HI> in particular, one of their number; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he declared, he would not believe, unle&s;s he &s;hould <HI>&s;ee in his hands the print of the nails, put his finger into the print of the nail, and thru&s;t his hand into his &s;ide,</HI> John xx. 25. An ar|gument that the&s;e witne&s;&s;es were not prepared to report any thing, but mu&s;t be convinced of the things before they could believe them them&s;elves and report them to others.</P>
<P>Now I think it is evident, that the apo&s;tles and evangeli&s;ts, mu&s;t on this account be e&s;teemed very authentic and &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es. It is a rule in the civil law, that te&s;timony upon hear&s;ay, is not valid; becau&s;e, &s;ay the civilians, witne&s;&s;es are to te&s;tify the truth, and not the po&s;&s;ibility of things; which is agreeable to the law of nature, and every where re|ceived. Witne&s;&s;es are to tell what they them&s;elves have &s;een and heard, and not what others report. And thus did the apo&s;tles of our Lord.</P>
<P>So that this fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary character is
<PB N="55" REF="028262_0059_0FD7F468E96726D0">found in the writers of the Bible. They had &s;uf|ficient knowledge of the things they wrote.</P>
<P N="2">2. As they were acquainted with the facts they publi&s;hed, &s;o they were per&s;ons of integrity, and may be depended on in the account they give. The former is nece&s;&s;ary that they might not be im|po&s;ed on them&s;elves, and this is nece&s;&s;ary that they might not impo&s;e on others. And in how eminent a manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this character, might be &s;hewn at large, would the time and your patience allow me to in&s;i&s;t on the argument.</P>
<P>As for Mo&s;es, he has many characters of great openne&s;s, integrity, and &s;implicity. We find him &s;poken of by ancient hi&s;torians with a very high encomium, as al&s;o by Stephen who repre&s;ents him as exceeding fair, as learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians, as mighty in word and deed; and yet the&s;e things he him&s;elf pa&s;&s;es over, without any mention at all; though he takes very particular no|tice of his own infirmaties; as his want of eloquence, and being <HI>&s;low of &s;peech,</HI> Exod. iv. 10; his impati|ence, Numb. xi. 10; his unbelief, Numb. xx. 12; his rebelling again&s;t the commandment of God, with which God was &s;o far di&s;plea&s;ed that he ex|cluded him the promi&s;ed land, Numb. xxvii. 14; of his great anger, Exod. xi. 8; and of his being very wroth, Numb. xvi. 5. He takes notice of his declining the mea&s;ures God calls him to over and over; a&s;cribes the new modelling of the go|vernment to Jethro's advice; and not to his own wi&s;dom and policy. In &s;hort, he neither &s;pares his people nor him&s;elf, but &s;ets forth their mur|murings and apo&s;tacies, and his own weakne&s;&s;es and frailties with all imaginable freedom. And when he came to die was &s;o far from &s;eeking to aggrandize his family, that he leaves them in ob|&s;curity, and devolves the government upon Jo&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, a man of another tribe.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="028262_0060_0FD7F469D3F39EC8">
I will add one con&s;ideration more, which I think a glorious in&s;tance of Mo&s;es's integrity, and that he was fully convinced of the truth of what he wrote, and the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> his for&s;aking the honors and advantages of a court, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his turning his back on all the preferment he mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> have expected there. This the apo&s;tle re|ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a proof of his &s;elf-denial, that he <HI>refu&s;ed to be called the &s;on of Pharaoh's daughter; chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on.</HI> And I think it no le&s;s a proof of the conviction he had of the call of God, and that he engaged in the office he undertook upon principles of religion and &s;incerity. In a word, there is nothing that looks like ambi|tion vanity and a &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ign in any of the writings, or any part of the conduct of Mo&s;es; nothing that &s;avours of counterfeit and impo&s;ture: but a great air of &s;implicity, &s;elf-denial and hone&s;ty appears in all.</P>
<P>The &s;ame I might &s;hew with reference to the apo&s;tles and writers of the New Te&s;tament. Give me leave to &s;ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a few in&s;tances. That they were no cheats, and did not de&s;ign an impo&s;ture, and im|po&s;e upon the world by fraud, is evident from a great many particulars in their character and con|duct. I will but ju&s;t mention three or four things.</P>
<P N="1">1. They were plain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">terate men, no way qua|lified to manage &s;o great and high an impo&s;ture as they were con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erned in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed an impo&s;ture. Their education was low and mean, and &s;ome have ob&s;erved their employment as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;her|men, tended to flatten their &s;pirits; for being much on the water in open boats, and in the night often, they were expo&s;ed to cold and phlegmatic air, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat mu&s;t naturally d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minds and &s;pirits. Now can we imagine that &s;uch men as the&s;e, rude and unacquainted with the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trangers.
<PB N="57" REF="028262_0061_0FD7F46B8BE81880">to the arts of politicians, &s;hould be capable of car|rying on &s;o deep an intrigue, inventing &s;uch &s;tories as the go&s;pel contains, and palming them upon mankind. That they &s;hould undertake it is not rea&s;onable to be &s;uppo&s;ed; but that they &s;hould &s;uc|ceed in it, as actually they did, again&s;t all the power and learning of the world, exceeds even the wild|e&s;t imagination that can be formed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The doctrine they preached to the world was &s;uch as &s;hews it could not be a contrivance of their own; but that they faithfully delivered what they had received and learned from above. Had it been of their own framing, they would certainly have &s;uited it more to the genius and gu&s;t of man|kind. Whereas nothing was more contrary thereto. They lay re&s;traints upon the darling pa&s;&s;ions of all &s;orts of men; the ambitious, the covetous, and the voluptuous; and call them to the ungrateful duties of mortification and &s;elf denial. In&s;tead of falling in with the common prejudices of the world, and of their own countrymen particularly, who expected a pompous triumphant Me&s;&s;iah, they con&s;tantly re|pre&s;ent him under the low and ignominious cha|racter of one crucified, than which nothing could be more offen&s;ive, being to the <HI>Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> They in&s;i&s;t upon the abrogation and repeal of the ceremonies of the <HI>Jewi&s;h law,</HI> which they knew their nation would never bear; having the highe&s;t zeal for that law, and being per&s;uaded it mu&s;t abide for ever. They declare with the greate&s;t freedom again&s;t pagan idolatry, endeavor to demoli&s;h the altars of their gods, and pour contempt upon their &s;acred rites. They &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e the traditions and cu&s;toms that were held mo&s;t venerable, both among Jews and Gentiles; and as was complained of them, <HI>turned the world up&s;ide down.</HI> Now I would a&s;k any rea&s;onable per&s;on, whether if they had been
<PB N="58" REF="028262_0062_0FD7F4713B27A570">impo&s;tors, had publi&s;hed a hi&s;tory and a doctrine out of their own heads, they would have laid the beginning in &s;o unpopular a manner? certainly, had they de&s;igned to win pro&s;elytes by inventions of their own, they would have made their inventi|ons more agreeable, more like to have gained on tho&s;e they hoped to deceive.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are eminent marks of &s;incerity in their writings. How freely do they publi&s;h their own faults? their pride, ambition, cowardice, covetou&s;|ne&s;s, emulation, and the like. They tell you that one of them&s;elves betrayed their ma&s;ter, that ano|ther of them denied him, that all of them for&s;ook him and fled. They publi&s;h a &s;hameful &s;tory of them&s;elves, that they contended which of them &s;hould be greate&s;t. And Matthew leaves a cen&s;ure upon his former life, which Eu&s;ebius ob&s;erves is mentioned by none but him&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had been a <HI>publican and &s;at at the receipt of cu&s;tom,</HI> a thing of very ill fame at that time. Peter, &s;uppo&s;|ing that Mark wrote his go&s;pel under his conduct, as is generally thought, &s;ets forth his denying his ma&s;ter with all the aggravations of the &s;in, more than is to be found in the re&s;t of the evangeli&s;ts; but pa&s;&s;es over very &s;lightly the account of his re|pentance.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e, and the like, are &s;uch in&s;tances of &s;implicity, humility, and hone&s;ty, as are never to be found among impo&s;tors and writers of fal&s;e hi&s;|tory. They generally take care to &s;ecure their own reputation, and make them&s;elves the heroes of the &s;tory, and to &s;erve their party and their cau&s;e at any rate. But as the&s;e writers are free from &s;uch blemi&s;hes, and thus on all occa&s;ions lay open their own infirmities, it is a good argument they had no cau&s;e to &s;erve but that of truth. I might add,</P>
<P N="4">4. They could propo&s;e to them&s;elves no worldly
<PB N="59" REF="028262_0063_0FD7F4723A59F918">advantage, but fully expected reproach, per&s;ecuti|on, poverty, and all &s;orts of &s;ufferings, as what would attend and follow the cau&s;e they had e&s;pou&s;|ed. And accordingly it &s;ell out. But yet,</P>
<P N="5">5. Notwith&s;tanding they per&s;i&s;ted in their &s;tory even to death, and &s;ealed their te&s;timony with their blood. Not one of them ever recanted, or ever owned him&s;elf an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>Now to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e men were cheats, that they did not them&s;elves believe the truth of what they publi&s;hed to the world, is I think to &s;uppo&s;e human nature in them different from what it is in all others. One mu&s;t really change it into another thing in them, quite different from what we know it and feel it to be in our&s;elves, before he can im|agine that herein they acted a part and de&s;igned to deceive. For let us &s;uppo&s;e them cunning enough to have forged their hi&s;tory, and hammered the &s;cheme of the go&s;pel out of their own heads, which yet I think is impo&s;&s;ible, and let us &s;uppo&s;e them wicked enough to have undertaken it. Yet I a&s;k, what motive could they have to do it? would they be at all this pains, and guilty of all this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lene&s;s, for no other end but to be undone in this world, and damned in the next? as they mu&s;t know was their due, if they believed another &s;tate.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid may let us &s;ee that the wri|ters of the Bible were qualified to publi&s;h a true hi&s;tory. What follows will more fully prove that their hi&s;tory is certainly true; otherwi&s;e there is no true hi&s;tory in the world. I proceed therefore to illu&s;trate the next particular requi&s;ite in an au|thentic hi&s;torian.</P>
<P N="3">3. They wrote at the time when the facts they re|late are &s;aid to have been done; and I add, tho&s;e facts are of &s;uch a nature that it could not but be publicly known, whether they were done or not.
<PB N="60" REF="028262_0064_0FD7F47A4D709CE0">Cheats generally lay the &s;cene at a great di&s;tance, when none alive is capable of di&s;pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them. Thus the heathen mythologi&s;ts tell &s;trange &s;tories of things tran&s;acted many ages ago, no body knows when nor where. But the writers of the Bible report things done in their own times, and fre&s;h in the memory of multitudes to whom they appeal.</P>
<P>That Mo&s;es did &s;o, is evident to any one that peru&s;es his hi&s;tory. He wrote when that generati|on was alive that was concerned in the main &s;ub|ject of his book. And he publi&s;hed &s;uch things that it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have impo&s;ed them upon the people, had they been fal&s;e. For in&s;tance, the ten plagues of Egypt, their deliverance out of that land, their pa&s;&s;age through the red &s;ea, the drowning of Pharaoh and his ho&s;t therein, with the many &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tances that attended that event; the feeding them in the wilderne&s;s by the con&s;tant miracle of manna, the i&s;&s;uing water out of the rock at Horeb upon Mo&s;es's &s;miting it with his rod, the defeat of Amalek, the giving the law at mount Sinai, the pillar of fire, and of a cloud, which conducted their march through the wilder|ne&s;s, the de&s;truction of Corah, Dathan, and Abi|ram, with their company, the earth opening her mouth and &s;wallowing them up. Now I would a&s;k any impartial per&s;on, whether there was room for impo&s;ture here? could not this people tell whether they had &s;een any of the wonders in Egypt, Mo&s;es gives &s;o particular an account of? could they not tell, whether they had pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ea? or had &s;een the Egyptians drowned therein? whether they had been fed with manna or not? and heard the thunders of Sinai, and &s;een the glory of the Lord there?</P>
<P>I might take notice, could I here expatiate, that there were &s;everal circum&s;tances of the&s;e events, which rendered them &s;o remarkable and notorious,
<PB N="61" REF="028262_0065_0FD7F47D97056AD8">that it is not po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be mi&s;taken. Thus when the law was delivered at Sinai, the people were commanded to prepare them&s;elves for it three days beforehand; and it is &s;aid that all the people &s;aw the thundering and lightning, and beheld the mountain &s;moaking, which filled them with &s;o much terror, that they &s;tood afar off, and de&s;ired Mo&s;es might mediate between them and the Lord, and that the Lord might not &s;peak any more lea&s;t they &s;hould die. And we read, that <HI>the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was upon it by night, in the &s;ight of all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, throughout all their journies,</HI> Exod. xl. 38. And &s;o great a regard had they to it, that it pre&s;cribed and determined all their marches whil&s;t in the wilder|ne&s;s. <HI>Whether it was two days or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, the children of I&s;rael abode in their tents and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed,</HI> Numb. ix. 22. So the manna was their con&s;tant &s;upply till the day after they had eaten of the corn of Canaan, and then it cea&s;ed, Jo&s;h. v. 12. So long al&s;o their gar|ments la&s;ted without any decay, Deut. xxix. 5. This Mo&s;es relates in his hi&s;tory. Whether it was fact or no, there were as many witne&s;&s;es as there were people; their eyes, their ears, all their &s;en&s;es were witne&s;&s;es whether the&s;e things were &s;o. Had not they been true, or had they been otherwi&s;e than is related, thou&s;ands might have &s;tood forth and di&s;credited the whole &s;tory; and &s;uppo&s;ing them fal&s;e, I dare defy any unbeliever in the world to give a rea&s;onable account why they did not.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve further, as what very much &s;trengthens the argument, that we find Mo&s;es him|&s;elf making a &s;olemn appeal to them concerning the&s;e facts. Con&s;ult the pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Deut.</HI> xi. from <HI>ver.</HI> 2, to the 8th, <HI>And know you this day: for I &s;peak not with your children which have not known, and
<PB N="62" REF="028262_0066_0FD7F47EE07D8140">which have not &s;een the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Lord your God, his greatne&s;s, his mighty hand, and his &s;tretched out arm; and his miracles, and his acts which he did in the mid&s;t of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; and what he did unto the army of Egypt, to their hor&s;es, and to their chariots, how he made the water of the red &s;ea overflow them; and what he did unto you in the wilderne&s;s, until ye came to this place; and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, how the earth opened her mouth and &s;wallowed them up, their hou&s;holds, tents, and all the &s;ub&s;tance in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the mid&s;t of all I&s;rael. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t your eyes have &s;een all the great acts of the Lord, which he did,</HI> You &s;ee he appeals to the people them&s;elves as witne&s;&s;es, eye-witne&s;&s;es of what he &s;aith, and what he records; which he could never have done, had he acted the impo&s;tor, and de&s;igned to have impo&s;ed upon them a narrative of &s;trange things, without any foun|dation.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, that the people were not witne&s;&s;es of all the hi&s;tory he relates; that in Ge|ne&s;is particularly. They knew nothing of the creation, the flood, and affairs of the patriarchs. The&s;e things were at a great di&s;tance, and Mo&s;es might here impo&s;e on their credulity.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that be&s;ide the extraordinary character of Mo&s;es's &s;idelity, he gave &s;uch proofs of his di|vine in&s;piration, (of which hereafter) that he could not be &s;u&s;pected. But more directly to the ob|jection, I &s;ay, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for Mo&s;es to forge this part of his hi&s;tory, and make the peo|ple believe it. The&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed through but a few hands, as remarked before, and the memory of them was ea&s;ily pre&s;erved. Granting there were above two thou&s;and years from the creation to Mo&s;es, yet if Adam, Methu&s;elah and Shem, lived the far greate&s;t part of them, they ought to be e&s;|teemed no more than three generations. And
<PB N="63" REF="028262_0067_0FD7F4806FA3C530">therefore, allowing for the length of men's lives at that time, the di&s;tance from the flood to Mo&s;es, cannot be computed &s;o much as from the reforma|tion to the pre&s;ent year. Now is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch things as Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory contains, &s;hould be invented by an hi&s;torian at this time, and the nation made to believe them? could any man in his &s;en&s;es be made to believe that Henry VIII, was the fir&s;t king of England, that there was a deluge in his time that took off all the inhabitants of the i&s;land, except &s;even or eight per&s;ons, or that at the revolution, the Thames was diverted from its proper channel, and the prince of Orange pa&s;&s;ed over with his army on dry land. And yet this, as ab&s;urd as it appears, might as ea&s;ily be believed among us, as what Mo&s;es &s;ays of the deluge, and of the children of I&s;rael's deliverance out of Egypt, by the people of his time, had it not been true. Several hundred years were no more, by a ju&s;t computation, con&s;idering how much longer men lived than they do now, than one hundred years is with us, a thou&s;and years, not much more than a hundred now, in one part of the period, and but about equal to two hundred in another part of the period. And upon this principle, I do affirm, it was no more po&s;&s;ible for Mo&s;es to invent the things of an earlier date in his hi&s;tory, and bring the peo|ple of his age to believe them, than it would be for a cunning &s;ophi&s;ter to contrive a legend of prodi|gious things done at, or &s;ince the reformation, and make them pa&s;s current among us.</P>
<P>Some may farther object, that the hi&s;tory we a&s;|cribe to Mo&s;es, might not be wrote at the time that is pretended, but might be the invention of later times. But that there is not the lea&s;t probability of this. I think I could demon&s;trate, was the pulpit the proper place for &s;uch an argument, and the auditory prepared to attend to it. I will only mention a few
<PB N="64" REF="028262_0068_0FD7F481D57BC568">things, that would admit of greater enlargement.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Mo&s;es was univer&s;ally owned as the law|giver of the Jews. That people them&s;elves uni|ver&s;ally believed this, and have in all ages paid the utmo&s;t veneration to his memory. Nor did any of the mo&s;t ancient heathen writers pretend to deny, there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Mo&s;es, or que&s;tion, whether he gave laws to the Jewi&s;h nation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The objector cannot give any account when, or by whom, this hi&s;tory, and the&s;e facts related in the five books we a&s;cribe to Mo&s;es, were forged. He cannot tell us the name of this imaginary hi&s;to|rian that per&s;onated Mo&s;es; tell us when he lived, nor produce any authentic vouchers of the thing he &s;uppo&s;es. So that in rea&s;on, the objection ought to be looked upon a mere cavil, and &s;uch as might be made again&s;t any other book in the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is mo&s;t ab&s;urd to imagine the&s;e things &s;hould be the invention of later times, or of any time. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The whole polity and government of the Jews was founded upon their laws. Not only their religion, but civil rites depended upon them, their courts of ju&s;tice, their private privileges, their &s;e|veral properties, their inheritances, all depended upon, and were regulated by the laws &s;aid to be gi|ven by the mini&s;try of Mo&s;es. Now let any one con&s;ider, whether it be po&s;&s;ible for any impo&s;tor to contrive a body of laws, and when he has done, im|po&s;e them upon a whole nation, and per&s;uade them to &s;ubmit all their rights, claims and privileges, to the deci&s;ion of tho&s;e laws. He that &s;uppo&s;es this is the ca&s;e of the Jews, &s;uppo&s;es a thing altogether &s;ingular, and what never came to pa&s;s in any other nation in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many of their laws were of that nature, that one cannot with the lea&s;t rea&s;on, think they would have received them, had they not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they were divine. How but then&s;ome a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of
<PB N="65" REF="028262_0069_0FD7F48661662008">circumci&s;ion? how co&s;tly and trouble&s;ome their &s;a|crifices, with all the numerous precepts about eating, uncleanne&s;s, purgation, wa&s;hing and the like. The&s;e things made their law a yoke, as the apo&s;tle calls it, <HI>which they were not able to bear.</HI> Their weekly &s;ab|bath, was a very great confinement and re&s;traint, which they never would have come under upon the motion of a private man, that enjoins &s;uch things without authority. And to add only one particular more, their &s;abbatical year I reckon a law of &s;uch a nature, that it would never have been e&s;tabli&s;hed among them upon the credit of an impo&s;tor. The law in &s;hort was, that every &s;eventh year their land was to re&s;t. They were neither to &s;ow their ground, prune their vineyards, nor to gather any corn or fruits that grew &s;pontaneou&s;ly that year, Exod. xxiii. 10, 11. This was a &s;tatute that their lawgiver, who|ever he was, obliged them to. The ob&s;ervation of which would have expo&s;ed them to the greate&s;t mi|&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, without the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition and ble&s;&s;ing of heaven for their relief. That they might ju&s;tly apprehend this, is intimated, Lev. xxv. 20, 21, 22. <HI>And if ye &s;hall &s;ay, what &s;hall we eat the &s;eventh year? behold we &s;hall not &s;ow nor gather in our increa&s;e.</HI> It follows by way of an&s;wer, <HI>Then will I command my ble&s;&s;ing upon you in the &s;ixth year, and it &s;hall bring forth fruit for three years, and ye &s;hall &s;ow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year, until her fruits come in ye &s;hall eat of the old &s;tore.</HI> Here was you &s;ee, a law that ca&s;t them entirely upon an extraordinary providence, for two years. The &s;ixth year was to afford provi&s;ion for three years. Now I a&s;k any con&s;iderate per&s;on, whether he can rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e they would have embraced &s;uch a law from an impo&s;tor? or if they had not thought it to be from heaven? I a&s;k fur|ther, if they did receive it, as it is certain they did, was this &s;ecurity given them, of an extraordinary
<PB N="66" REF="028262_0070_0FD7F492A3F5F2A8">ble&s;&s;ing the &s;ixth year, made good or not? If not, that of it&s;elf would have di&s;covered the cheat. If it was made good, it is a full evidence the law was divine,</P>
<P>So that con&s;idering the nature of the&s;e laws, I think it a demon&s;tration, they could not be the contrivance of any, but were given by Mo&s;es, and that by the &s;pecial appointment of heaven, as he affirms. The rea&s;on is, they would not otherwi&s;e have received them. They were &s;o much again&s;t their ca&s;e and their pre&s;ent intere&s;ts, had not God made up all to them by a peculiar providence, they had &s;o much of burden in them, that no le&s;s autho|rity, than that by which Mo&s;es acted, and which they knew he was inve&s;ted with, could have inforc|ed them upon them. Their heathen neighbors laughed at them as a fooli&s;h people, for throwing away a &s;eventh part of their time; becau&s;e they kept the weekly &s;abbath, and would they have yielded not only to this, but to a &s;abbatical year, and to many other cumber&s;ome ob&s;ervances, if they had not had a full conviction of Mo&s;es's commi&s;&s;i|on, and of the divine authority of their laws.</P>
<P N="3">3. The methods taken to in&s;truct the people, both in the law from the fir&s;t promulgation of it, and in matters of fact from the time that they hap|pened; were &s;uch as leaves no room for impo&s;ture. They were all of them obliged to the mo&s;t careful &s;tudy of the law, and to propagate the knowledge of it in their families: <HI>The&s;e words which I command thee this day,</HI> (&s;ays their legi&s;lator) <HI>&s;hall be in thine heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy chil|dren, and &s;hall talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, when thou walke&s;t by the way, when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> Add to that, every &s;eventh year, at the end of the year, the book of the law was brought forth and read in the audience of all the people, men, women, children, and &s;tran|gers,
<PB N="67" REF="028262_0071_0FD7F4949AFCA930"><HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 10. The autograph or original book of Mo&s;es, as &s;ome think, was then produced that the people might hear their law recited in the words in which Mo&s;es left it.</P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t be remembered, that this book con|tained not only their decalogue, their ordinances of wor&s;hip, &s;acrifices and ceremonies, their appoint|ments of fe&s;tivals, and the like; but al&s;o the hi&s;tory of God's providence towards them, the judgments he had wrought among them, and the deliverances he had wrought for them. The&s;e they often heard read, the&s;e they read them&s;elves, and were &s;o well acquainted with, that Jo&s;ephus tells us, they knew them as perfect as their own names. And this be|ing the &s;tate of that people, of the main body of them at lea&s;t, I would demand, could it be po&s;&s;ible for any man after Mo&s;es's time to invent &s;uch a book, and per&s;uade people to receive it? to in|vent a narrative of &s;uch facts, and prevail with a whole nation to own them as facts, though they knew nothing of them, and though they could not but know they were fal&s;e?</P>
<P>The books were in their hands, and in their hearts, as you have heard. Now there mu&s;t be a time when the&s;e books were fir&s;t read. If it was a long time after the facts were done, could not the people tell, whether they had ever heard of &s;uch things before, as the plagues in Egypt, the dividing the red &s;ea, the delivering the law at mount Sinai, and the miracles in the wilderne&s;s? and if they knew all the&s;e things, the point is granted I am plead|ing for, the book was wrote, when we &s;ay it was wrote, in Mo&s;es's time, and when a great part of the generation remained, that had &s;een the tran&s;|actions there de&s;cribed. If they knew them not, how came they to receive a book that relates &s;uch &s;trange things, and not only &s;o, but appeals to them|&s;elves
<PB N="68" REF="028262_0072_0FD7F4961775DFE8">as knowing them. He that can &s;uppo&s;e this, is &s;trangely prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favor of infidelity, and indeed prepared to believe any thing, but the Bible.</P>
<P>Let me add, they had public memorials of many of their great events. To &s;ay nothing of the names of per&s;ons, and places, which were given at the time of this or that event, and de&s;igned to perpet|uate the memory of it; &s;ome of their fe&s;tivals were of this nature. Their pa&s;&s;over was a monument rai&s;ed up to pre&s;erve the memory of their deliverance from Egypt, and of the &s;laying the fir&s;t-born there. The fea&s;t of tabernacles was a memorial of their dwelling in booths in the wilderne&s;s. Aaron's rod, the pot of manna, the golden cen&s;or, the bra&s;en &s;erpent; the&s;e and the like were &s;tanding records of great and eminent providences towards that nation.</P>
<P>And two things I infer from them, <HI>viz.</HI> that as they were monuments, public records of ancient facts expounded to the people and well under&s;tood by them, they could not be ignorant of the&s;e facts. The fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over was a con&s;tant memorial of what happened in Egypt, and whil&s;t it was yearly repeated among them, they could not forget that great &s;alvation. And further, as the&s;e memorials took ri&s;e, and were in&s;tituted immediately, upon &s;uch events to which they refer, the hi&s;tory of the&s;e facts could not be the forgery of after times.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;ufficiently proved, that Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory was wrote at the time when the facts they relate are &s;aid to be done, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could not be an invention of a later date. You will excu&s;e me for in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch things. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am &s;en&s;ible they will be le&s;s acceptable to tho&s;e, that never had their thoughts employed about &s;ubjects of this na|ture. But as I am per&s;uaded of their importance, &s;o, I hope, in the progre&s;s of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, to make you &s;en&s;ible of their u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="028262_0073_0FD7F497B3017AD8">
Some may a&s;k probably, though we allow the hi&s;tory to be as ancient as is de&s;ired, how doth it appear that Mo&s;es was the writer of it? I an&s;wer, it was con&s;tantly believed by the Jews them&s;elves: other places of Scripture a&s;cribe it to him; it was owned by the mo&s;t ancient writers among the Pa|gans, at lea&s;t he was owned by them as the Jewi&s;h lawgiver. As for the objections of Spino&s;a, Hobbs, and father Simon, I apprehend it would be thought tedious, &s;hould I go about to con&s;ider them di&s;|tinctly. They all amount to little more than this, that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the Pentateuch could not be written by Mo&s;es; and, I mu&s;t declare, I know no inconvenience in allowing they might be in&s;ert|ed by &s;ome after-writer; as, for in&s;tance, by Ezra; though I am &s;atisfied mo&s;t of tho&s;e they in&s;i&s;t on, may fairly be accounted for, without any &s;uch con|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I next proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> And what I have here to a&s;&s;ert and maintain is, that the facts there recorded were publicly done, and the hi&s;tory wrote at the very time when it might be known, whether they were done or not.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I think, I need not di&s;|cour&s;e at large upon that &s;ubject. The doctrine, the miracles of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were none of them concealed; but all things were tran&s;acted in the pre&s;ence of their enemies, and expo&s;ed to their view. Hence our Lord pleads in his own defence before the high prie&s;t, <HI>I &s;pake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always re&s;ort; and in &s;ecret have I &s;aid nothing.</HI> And both the go&s;pels, and the hi&s;tory of the Acts, inform us of the miracles the apo&s;tles wrought in the mo&s;t populous cities, at Jeru&s;alem, Samaria, Antioch, and other places. How eminent an event was the effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the apo&s;tles on the day of Pen|teco&s;t;
<PB N="70" REF="028262_0074_0FD7F499AA4B0E90">and how vi&s;ible and public the effects of it. They were enabled to work miracles, and to &s;peak with all &s;orts of tongues, which they did in the pre&s;ence of a multitude of people from all parts of the world. At that great fe&s;tival, Jeru&s;a|lem was filled not only with the natives of Judea, but with the Jews of the di&s;per&s;ion. They came from the ea&s;t as far as Per&s;ia and Media; from the we&s;t, as far as Rome and Lybia; from the &s;outh, as far as Arabia; and from the north, as far as Parthia, and many provinces of A&s;ia the le&s;s. Now in this convention, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, and in the mo&s;t public manner, the apo&s;|tles and preachers of Chri&s;t gave a &s;pecimen of the extraordinary power with which they were indued from on high, and &s;pake all kinds of languages they had never learned: an a&s;toni&s;hing thing! at which the auditory were all amazed: <HI>Are not the&s;e Gallileans?</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</HI></P>
<P>Further, as the facts recorded in the New Te&s;ta|ment, were done in the face of the world, &s;o the hi&s;|tory was publi&s;hed in that age, and whil&s;t the wit|ne&s;&s;es were alive. That it was thus early publi&s;hed is evident, &s;ince it mentions the temple and nation of the Jews as &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting: &s;o that con&s;equently, it mu&s;t be written before the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem. The Acts of the Apo&s;tles, were wrote by St. Luke, &s;oon after St. Paul's going to Rome, an ac|count of which he gives at the clo&s;e of that hi&s;tory. Now this was but about twenty years, after our Lord's re&s;urrection. And you find he there men|tions his go&s;pel, as wrote before that time. But I need not &s;tand to prove what none of the enemies of chri&s;tianity dare take upon them to deny. Hobbs him&s;elf owns, that the writers of the New Te&s;tament lived all in le&s;s than an age after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, and had &s;een our Lord, or been his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028262_0075_0FD7F49B79BA07C8">
The purpo&s;e I bring this for, is, to &s;hew that the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament, mu&s;t be unque&s;tion|ably true; otherwi&s;e, the writers of it would never have publi&s;hed it to the world, and in the mid&s;t of their enemies of all &s;orts, when &s;o many thou&s;ands were living that could have detected the fal&s;hood. The books they wrote, were immediately di&s;per&s;ed, read in all chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies, as Ju&s;tin Martyr a&s;|&s;ures us, And the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t preachers, wher|ever they came, always in&s;i&s;ted upon the great facts of them, the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and the miracles that were wrought, <HI>God &s;till working with them, confirming their words with &s;igns following.</HI> To which may be added, that the next chri&s;tians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The next chri&s;tians in the age after the apo&s;tles.]</HI> Remarkable to this purpo&s;e, is that of Quadratus, who as Eu&s;ebius a&s;&s;ures us, de|dicated and pre&s;ented an apology for the chri&s;tian religion to the emperor Adrian, about the year 120: in which were the&s;e words, <HI>The works of our Saviour were always con&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ous, for they were true. Tho&s;e that were healed, &s;uch as were rai&s;ed from the dead, did not only ap|pear after they were healed, and rai&s;ed, but al&s;o were afterwards &s;een of all, and that not only whil&s;t our &s;aviour was conver&s;ant upon earth, but al&s;o after he was gone; they continued alive a great while, in&s;omuch that &s;ome of them &s;urvived even to our times.</HI> Eu&s;ebius declares in the &s;ame place, that this book of Quadratus was extant among many of the brethren in his time, and that he him&s;elf had it, Eccle&s;. Hid. L. iv. c. 3. And we have another ob&s;ervable pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ame effect in the epi&s;tle of Irenaeus to Florinus, where that father, who flouri&s;hed before the year 170, &s;peaks of his being with Poly|carp in his youth, who&s;e per&s;on and di&s;cour&s;es he perfectly rem|embered, the conver&s;ation, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he had with St John, and others, that had &s;een the Lord: and what Polycarp had receiv|ed concerning our Saviour, his doctrine and miracles, from tho&s;e who had been the eye witne&s;&s;es, all exactly agreeing with the &s;criptures. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;eb. Hi&s;t. Eccl. L. iii.</NOTE> in the age after Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, con&s;tantly profe&s;&s;ed an a&s;&s;urance of the facts recorded in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to any rea&s;onable per&s;on, whether this looks like impo&s;ture, or whether there be any in&s;tance in the whole world, of an impo&s;ture that
<PB N="72" REF="028262_0076_0FD7F49CEA1DAD60">comes up to it? Would the apo&s;tles have taken this method, and have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the contempt of mankind, had they not been con|&s;cious of their own integrity, and a&s;&s;ured that none of their enemies could contradict what they &s;ay? They report to the world that their ma&s;ter ro&s;e again, that the jews &s;ealed the &s;epulchre, that they craved a watch of Pilate to guard it, that the guard run away, and that the chief prie&s;ts, and others, hi|red the &s;oldiers to &s;ay, while they &s;lept, his di&s;|ciples came and &s;tole him away. They affirmed, that a per&s;on born lame, and known to all the in|habitants of Jeru&s;alem, by begging daily at a gate of the temple, was cured by Peter, only with invo|cating the name of Je&s;us, Acts iii. 6.</P>
<P>The&s;e and the like things, they report and write, and you will con&s;ider, that they do not write in a remote country and age, but at the very time when, and in the very place where, the matters were tran&s;|acted: which I think &s;o &s;trong an argument of the truth of their hi&s;tory, that all the cavils of infidelity can never &s;hake it.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome may object, that in all this ar|gument, we appeal to the hi&s;tory it&s;elf, and are ta|king that for granted, which is the que&s;tion. We &s;uppo&s;e that there were &s;uch per&s;ons as Mo&s;es, as Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles; that they did &s;uch things, and that their hi&s;tory was wrote at &s;uch times. But this, &s;aith the unbeliever, wants to be proved. I an|&s;wer, that it is certain the&s;e hi&s;tories are now in the world, and I dare &s;ay, the objector will not pretend they were wrote either this or the la&s;t century. I demand therefore, when they were wrote? who wrote them? who invented the &s;tories of Mo&s;es and Chri&s;t, and when they were invented. It is but rea|&s;onable to expect from them, that they &s;hould fix upon &s;omething as certain, in oppo&s;ition to the ac|count we give; which yet, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> confident, they
<PB N="73" REF="028262_0077_0FD7F49E803AC2F8">will not pretend to; and con&s;equently, this ob|jection mu&s;t pa&s;s for a cavil.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hall more directly con&s;ider it, and remove the difficulty that it &s;eems to throw in our way, which will bring me to the next head, viz. That we do not depend purely on the authority of the hi&s;torians of the Bible, but have the chief facts confirmed by very ancient, and &s;ome of them co|temporary writers. Now this, as it fully an&s;wers the objection I ju&s;t mentioned, &s;o it tends very much to confirm the truth of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory. But as the &s;ubject is too copious to be brought into this di&s;cour&s;e, and too important to be pa&s;&s;ed over &s;u|perficially, I &s;hall take leave to re&s;ume it on ano|ther occa&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, let me make a reflection or two upon what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the Bible be true, as I am proving it is; how weighty and important a thing is religion? the doctrines and concerns of which have been handed down to us in the way mentioned there, by &s;uch a train of wonderful providences, &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing mi|racles, &s;uch labors and &s;ufferings of holy men; and which eclip&s;es all the re&s;t, of the Son of God him&s;elf. The Bible gives that account of the&s;e things, and makes all &s;ub&s;ervient to the great ends of religion: that one cannot but infer, it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t important thing in the world. The inter|e&s;t of the church, divine wor&s;hip, God's covenant and promi&s;es, his favor and eternal life, &amp;c. The&s;e mu&s;t certainly be the mo&s;t momentous affairs. They mu&s;t be &s;o if the Bible be true; otherwi&s;e, they had never been &s;o much the care of heaven, had never employed the council of God &s;o much as they have, if we may believe the Bible.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Bible be true, it de&s;erves our mo&s;t di|ligent and &s;erious &s;tudy, its &s;ubject is &s;o great, its tendency &s;o divine, and we have &s;o mighty an in|tere&s;t in the di&s;coveries it makes, and encourage|ments
<PB N="74" REF="028262_0078_0FD7F4A09871F710">it propo&s;es, that to neglect it, mu&s;t argue great &s;tupidity. And indeed, it is to revive and increa&s;e our veneration for the Bible, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in under&s;tanding and improving it, that I have undertaken the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, and the exerci&s;es that may follow. Did we believe the Bible more, con|ver&s;e with it, and &s;tudy it more, it would tend to give us a di&s;ta&s;te of many of tho&s;e little things that fill our time and thoughts. Nor do I ever expect to &s;ee religion recover its lu&s;tre, till the Bible re|covers its reputation among us. I do not mean, only re&s;cued from the contempt of &s;uch low tri|flers as prefer a play book to it; but from the ne|glect and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s with which mo&s;t chri&s;tians treat it. Were our tempers and frames right, we &s;hould only divert and turn a&s;ide to the things of this world, when, and &s;o far as the nece&s;&s;ity of our affairs, and duties of our places obliged us. But the &s;tudy of the Bible, and the practice of the great things it directs to, would be the main bu&s;ine&s;s to which our minds &s;tood bent. And happy will it be for us, if we find a &s;trong and prevailing bias this way! I have good authority for it, when I &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man who&s;e delight is in the law of the Lord, and therein doth meditate day and night.</HI></P>

<P>I AM endeavoring to prove the Bible is true, and particularly, that it is of equal credit with any other hi&s;tory in the world. To which purpo&s;e I have &s;hewn,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the per&s;ons who wrote it, had &s;ufficient opportunities of knowing the things they publi&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That they were per&s;ons of integrity, who, as they were not deceived them&s;elves, would not de|ceive others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That they wrote at the time when the facts they relate, are &s;aid to be done, and might be known to be done. I now add,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The account the writers of the Bible give of things. The particulars of their hi&s;tory is con|firmed by co-temporary, or at lea&s;t, very ancient writers, that had an opportunity of knowing the facts publi&s;hed there, and could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be bia&s;&s;ed in favor of tho&s;e that publi&s;hed them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>What can one expect more in an hi&s;torian, than that he knows his &s;ubject, whether the things he publi&s;hes be true or fal&s;e; that he be a per&s;on of
<PB N="76" REF="028262_0080_0FD7F4AD5799B3C8">unblemi&s;hed hone&s;ty: that he writes at the very time of action, and when the things he relates were done; and that per&s;ons of the &s;ame age, who have an opportunity al&s;o of knowing the &s;ame things, do not deny, but confirm his account. If the&s;e cha|racters be not &s;ufficient to make an ancient hi&s;tori|an authentic, there is none in the world to be de|pended on. Now the writers of the Bible have them all in a degree above any others. I have proved this with reference to the three former par|ticulars, and am now to do it in relation to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t part of the Bible, the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, there may &s;eem a defect and want of vouch|ers. And it mu&s;t be granted, we cannot find co|temporary writers to confirm Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory. The rea&s;on is, there are no &s;uch, Mo&s;es being the mo&s;t ancient hi&s;torian in the world. And yet &s;omething we have to alledge in confirmation of the &s;acred hi&s;tory, and indeed as much as can rea&s;onably be expected, in the fir&s;t ages of the world. Now this being a point of great nicety, and yet of great ne|ce&s;&s;ity in the pre&s;ent argument, allow me to make a few ob&s;ervations; in which, I &s;hall not only let you &s;ee what foot&s;teps we have of Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory among the mo&s;t ancient writers, but al&s;o why we have no more, nor more early vouchers among them. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me ob&s;erve that the &s;acred hi&s;tory, that of Mo&s;es, is properly the hi&s;tory of the church. After the di&s;per&s;ion of the &s;ons of Noah, when the world was relap&s;ed into idolatry, God was plea&s;ed to &s;ingle out Abraham and erect a church in his family, to give them a covenant of peculiarity, di&s;tingui&s;hing them by many &s;pecial favors and privileges. Thus he tells them, <HI>Deut.</HI> xiv. 2. <HI>Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God; and the Lord hath cho&s;en thee to be a peculiar people unto him&s;elf, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="028262_0081_0FD7F4AEE3C10F98">They were a &s;eparate peculiar people, had peculiar laws; <HI>he &s;hewed his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes and judgments unto I&s;rael. He hath not dealt &s;o with any nation; and as for his judgments they have not known them,</HI> P&s;al. cxlvii. 19, 20. The apo&s;tle takes no|tice of this, <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 4. <HI>To them pertaineth the adop|tion, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the &s;ervice of God, and the promi&s;es.</HI> God was plea&s;ed to inclo&s;e and incorporate this people, for the &s;pecial purpo&s;es of religion, to &s;et them apart for him&s;elf; among them was his taber|nacle and &s;hechinah, the &s;eat of his wor&s;hip, his &s;pecial pre&s;ence, the di&s;plays of his grace, and thea|tre of his wonderful works. Now it mu&s;t be con|&s;idered, that the hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, par|ticularly of Mo&s;es, is an hi&s;tory of facts that more e&s;pecially concerned this people; of revelations made to them, and of things done among them and for them, that is, of things done within the inclo|&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">2. The circum&s;tances of the re&s;t of the world were &s;uch, that no very authentic memoirs, no par|ticular hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially of the affairs of this peo|ple, could be expected from them. They were left out of the pale of the church, and could have but a very imperfect knowledge of what was tran&s;acted within it. It was the po&s;terity of Abraham, the children of his grand&s;on Jacob, that went down into Egypt and &s;ojourned there, they and their de&s;cen|dants for &s;ome hundreds of years; who were the per&s;ons that &s;aw the miracles in Egypt, and at the red &s;ea. The&s;e were they that received the law at Sinai, and were entertained with that &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene of wonders in the wilderne&s;s, for forty years. The re&s;t of the nations as they bore no part in the&s;e things, &s;o all the knowledge they could have of them mu&s;t be by di&s;tant reports. They never &s;aw Mo&s;es by his rod turn the waters of Egypt into blood,
<PB N="78" REF="028262_0082_0FD7F4B092EC1DC0">and afterwards divide the red &s;ea, never &s;aw the flaming mount, on which the divine law was deli|vered; the my&s;terious cloud that de&s;cended, and conducted God's people for &s;o long a time. All the&s;e &s;trange phoenomena were among the I&s;rael|ites, and part of that glory and di&s;tinction God put upon his peculiar people.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the na|tions of the world were involved in gro&s;s ignorance, over-run with idolatry, and &s;unk into barbari&s;m. Upon the confu&s;ion of tongues at Bable, and the defeat of that impious attempt thereby; the know|ledge of God, and of the true religion, began to decline in the world, and in a few generations was very much lo&s;t. I cannot better repre&s;ent this, than in the words of a learned man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stilling fleet</HI> Originae Sacrae. p. 11.</NOTE> <Q>The &s;ons of Noah, after their &s;everal di&s;per&s;ions and planta|tions of &s;everal countries, did gradually degene|rate into ignorance and barbarity; for upon their fir&s;t &s;ettling into any country, they found it em|ployment enough to cultivate the land, and pro|vide them&s;elves habitations and food</Q> He adds, <Q>They were often put to remove from one place to another, which Thucydides &s;peaks of as the ca&s;e of the ancient Grecians, and it was a great while before they came to embody in towns and cities, and from thence to &s;pread them&s;elves into pro|vinces, and to &s;ettle the bounds of their territories.</Q></P>
<P>This being the &s;tate of mo&s;t nations in the fir&s;t ages after their plantation, there was no likelihood of any great improvement in knowledge; &s;o far from it, that there would probably be a great decay of that knowledge, which had been conveyed down to them; their nece&s;&s;ities keeping them in conti|nual employment. It was a con&s;iderable time before they were &s;ettled under regular and formed govern|ments:
<PB N="79" REF="028262_0083_0FD7F4B2D5B49848">and till then, they had no opportunities to pur&s;ue arts and &s;ciences, or write hi&s;tory.

From which opi|nion, Thucydides tells us, the Athenians u&s;ed to wear their golden gra&s;shoppers.</P>
<P>There were two other cau&s;es, be&s;ides what I have ju&s;t mentioned, of the ignorance, and particularly of the defect of records and hi&s;tory, among the heathens, namely, the want of nece&s;&s;ary means and helps to pre&s;erve the memory of things. The Gre|cians, that mo&s;t of all others glory in their antiquity, had not the u&s;e of letters till Cadmus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Had not the u&s;e of letters till</HI> Cadmus.] Some learned men indeed have imagined the Greeks had the knowledge and u&s;e of letters before his time, having learned them from Cecrops the fir&s;t king of Athens, who led a colony out of Egypt, where learning and letters had long flouri&s;hed, fixed in Greece, built that city, and taught the u&s;e of letters to that people. But this conjecture, how probable &s;oever it may appear, is not &s;upported by &s;o many and good arguments, as the opinion of tho&s;e, who make Cadmus the fir&s;t author of the Greek letters. It is very certain if Cecrops did introduce any, there are no monuments of his characters re|maining, nor were they known to the mo&s;t ancient writers of that nation, who&s;e works are come down to us. The olde&s;t we have any memoirs of being tho&s;e taught by Cadmus, and his followers, that &s;eem at fir&s;t to have been the &s;ame with the Phaenician, as Herodotus te&s;tifies they were, and as may be concluded from the mo&s;t ancient Greek in&s;criptions, that we have copies of, particu|larly the Sigaean, given us by Dr. Chi&s;hul; whence it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve a very great affinity between the old Greek letters, and tho&s;e now called Samaritan, thought by many to have been origi|nally the Heb. e. v. and Phaenician characters.</NOTE> taught them the &s;ame; who, carry his antiquity the highe&s;t, was but co-temporary with Jo&s;hua, and many think him only co-temporary with Samuel. And as they wanted means, &s;o al&s;o an inclination to &s;uch work.
<PB N="80" REF="028262_0084_0FD7F4B2FACDA278">They had not learning &s;ufficient, to record things concerning them&s;elves, much le&s;s any inclination to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the affairs of other nations. The great events of the Bible were done among another &s;ort of people; as tho&s;e barbarians knew little of them, &s;o they had little zeal about them.</P>
<P>Add to this, as what may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that after God had confounded their language at Babel, and &s;cattered them abroad upon the face of the earth; he in a great mea&s;ure took his holy &s;pi|rit from them. And as they had not the &s;pecial re|velation from heaven, that the family of Abraham enjoyed, nor that intercour&s;e with God; they gra|dually fell into a forgetfulne&s;s of him; lo&s;t the knowledge of the true God, &s;et up idolatry, and run into tho&s;e horrid &s;uper&s;titions, that in proce&s;s of time, were the di&s;grace and reproach of human nature.</P>
<P>Now that a people in the&s;e circum&s;tances; thus abandoned of God, <HI>a people &s;itting in darkne&s;s, and in the regions of the &s;hadow of death;</HI> de&s;titute of arts and &s;ciences, in a great degree, and for a long time of letters; that knew little of their own affairs, had few or no memorials of their ance&s;tors; and &s;eldom extended their view beyond their own times and concerns; that the&s;e &s;hould not be hi&s;torians, and e&s;pecially hi&s;torians of the church is now wonder.</P>
<P N="3">3. As there are no hi&s;tories among them, but what fall much below the time of Mo&s;es, &s;o when they began to write the hi&s;tory of their re&s;pective nations, and of others, they mix it with fables to that degree, that little dependance can be had on the accounts they give.</P>
<P>Thucidides owns, they have no records of Greece before the Peloponne&s;ian war. All that he could di&s;cover in the ancient &s;tate of that country, was a great deal of confu&s;ion, as he tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, unquiet &s;tations, frequent removals, continual piracies, and
<PB N="81" REF="028262_0085_0FD7F4B4D630F438">no &s;ettled form of government. So that before that period, according to this writer, who is ju&s;tly cele|brated as the mo&s;t impartial of all the greek hi&s;to|rians, there was nothing certain among them, but all was mere chaos and confu&s;ion. Indeed, the Phaenician hi&s;tory by Sanconiatho, is acknowledged to be of more antiquity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Phaenician hi&s;tory by Sanchoniatho is acknowledged to be of more antiquity.] It is &s;o by the generality of learned men, as to &s;ay nothing of Eu&s;ebius and others anciently, by Grotious, Bochart, Stilling fleet, Cumberland, and many more among the moderns: not to mention Kircher, who pretended he had &s;een Sanchoniatho's original hi&s;tory; but there are &s;everal others, both of the la&s;t and the pre&s;ent age, who have called it into que&s;tion, and even rejected it as &s;purious. That great antiquary Mr. Dod|well offered divers arguments to prove it to be &s;o, and to &s;hew it was a forgery, if not of Porphyry him&s;elf, yet of Philo Biblius the tran&s;lator; and an ingenious writer has of late expre&s;&s;ed his &s;u&s;|picious concerning the genuinene&s;s and antiquity thereof, in &s;ome di&s;&s;ertations publi&s;hed in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the republic of letters, with a view of confuting bi&s;hop Cumberland's &s;y&s;tem of mythol|ogy in his learned treati&s;e upon Sanchoniatho's Phaenician hi&s;tory, in order to defend and e&s;tabli&s;h the chronology of the incompara|ble Sir I&s;aac Newton. However, without entering into that di&s;|pute, and admitting the book under con&s;ideration to be genuine, and as old as it can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, there are &s;everal things therein that are a &s;urpri&s;ing confirmation of the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory.</NOTE> And yet his greate&s;t ad|vocate, Prophyry, is forced to grant he was younger than Mo&s;es; Bochart makes him co-temporary with Gideon; though others think him much later.</P>
<P>I hinted, as their hi&s;tories are of le&s;s antiquity than the &s;acred hi&s;tory, &s;o they are very much di&s;|gui&s;ed with fables. This might be &s;hewn at large, was it proper here to &s;tand upon it. They found them&s;elves at a lo&s;s for materials for true hi&s;tory, wanting ancient monuments, and therefore made u&s;e of inventions to &s;upply the defect. Hence the famous di&s;tinction by Varo, of time into unknown, fabulous, and hi&s;torical; accounting all time, either ab&s;olutely unknown, or fabulous, till the fir&s;t Olympiad, which was when the world was three
<PB N="82" REF="028262_0086_0FD7F4B8D3EB22E8">thou&s;and years old. If it be a&s;ked, what purpo&s;e this &s;erves? I an&s;wer, it affords a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on why we &s;hould not expect the records of the Bible among heathen hi&s;torians.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no wonder we find &s;o little in heathen authors concern|ing the Jews, their religion and affairs. As for the Romans their writers are comparatively of a late date. And for the Greeks they were not only very ignorant in antiquity, but &s;o full of them&s;elves as to de&s;pi&s;e all other people, and e&s;teem them barbarians; not excepting even the Romans, whom they appear to have known little of, till they were brought into &s;ubjection to them. Add to this, that it &s;eems highly probable, if not certain, that many of their authors de&s;ignedly omitted &s;peaking of the Jews, and their concerns, out of envy and hatred to them as Je&s;ephus ob&s;erves, and indeed proves by a remarkable in&s;tance. Be&s;ides, it is not to be doubted, but &s;everal of their works are now lo&s;t, wherein we might have met with accounts of that nation that would have confirmed the &s;acred hi&s;tory. This we know to be actually the ca&s;e with Hecataeus's book relating to the Jews, and we may be &s;ure it is &s;o in regard of many other Greek authors. Though after all, there are not a few of the old heathen writers, who&s;e works are come down to our hands, that make mention of them, and &s;ome particulars of their affairs agreeably to the &s;acred records, as Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Trogus, Pompeius, and other.</NOTE> You &s;ee they were out of the church, that Go&s;hen of the world, the land of light, and &s;pot where God di&s;played him&s;elf in the wonders of his providence. They can give no tolerable account of them&s;elves, their own original and affairs, for want of &s;ufficient authentic records. And we need not think it &s;trange that they &s;ay &s;o little of a people &s;eparated from them, and con|fined within &s;uch an inclo&s;ure as the Jews were.</P>
<P>And then, what has been &s;aid may al&s;o &s;erve to promote our veneration for the Bible. We had known little of the origin of the world, the maker of it, or of tho&s;e glorious acts of providence on which our religion is founded; had it not been for Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory. So that however our modern dei&s;ts de&s;pi&s;e the Bible, and in&s;ult Mo&s;es, as they &s;ometimes do with an impious freedom, they are
<PB N="83" REF="028262_0087_0FD7F4BB1C99BB48">beholden to the &s;acred writings for all that is valu|able in their knowledge of ancient things; the creation of the world, the fall of man, God's pur|po&s;e of grace towards fallen mankind, the mani|fe&s;tation of his power and providence in the govern|ment of the world for &s;ome thou&s;ands of years; the knowledge of the&s;e things we derive from the Bible, and entirely depend on divine revelation for. The mo&s;t ancient profane hi&s;torians here give but very little &s;atisfaction; they do not begin &s;oon enough, their di&s;cour&s;e is dark, ob&s;cure, broken, and di&s;gui&s;ed; the rea&s;on of which has been &s;uffi|ciently intimated. So that not only our faith, as chri&s;tians, is e&s;tabli&s;hed, but our curio&s;ity, as men, gratified by the Bible. But.</P>
<P N="4">4. Notwith&s;tanding the great di&s;advantages the heathens lay under, and the manife&s;t defects of their hi&s;tories; it may rea&s;onably be expected, that there &s;hould be pre&s;erved among them &s;ome me|mory of the great events recorded in the Bible. I ground this chiefly upon a fact, which with me ad|mits of no di&s;pute, <HI>viz.</HI> That all mankind proceed|ed from the &s;ame &s;tock, and had originally the &s;ame parents. What cavils are advanced again&s;t this, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent take notice of; nor can I find the lea&s;t weight in any of them. The Scrip|ture is &s;o plain in this matter, that I apprehend none can make a que&s;tion of it that believes the &s;acred writings. The apo&s;tle tells us Adam was the fir&s;t man. And our Lord, &s;peaking of Adam and Eve, &s;ays, that at the <HI>beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</HI> And the apo&s;tle more directly to our purpo&s;e, <HI>God hath made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on the face of the earth;</HI> &s;ome Greek copies followed herein by the Arabic, vulgar Latin, and others, read "of one," that is, of one man, leaving out "blood;" but there is no need of the critici&s;m; blood &s;ignifies,
<PB N="84" REF="028262_0088_0FD7F4C584A4CC08">as is common in the be&s;t Greek authors, the &s;tock out of which mankind &s;prings. Add to this, that Adam expre&s;sly calls his wife, the mother of all living, making that the rea&s;on of her name Eve. So that I need not call this a po&s;tulatum, and de|&s;ire it may be granted by tho&s;e that receive the Bible: It is a certain truth, fully revealed there, that from this pair, Adam and Eve, all mankind derived, and the whole world was peopled.</P>
<P>I am only to ob&s;erve further, that after the de&s;|truction of the world by the deluge, Noah and his &s;ons were the heads and parents of a new world. For this, at pre&s;ent, I appeal to the Scriptures; you have it in expre&s;s words, <HI>Gen.</HI> x. 32. after an ac|count of the de&s;cendants from Japhet, Ham, and Shem, it is added, <HI>the&s;e are the families of the &s;ons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations, and by the&s;e were the nations divided in the carth a&s;ter the flood.</HI></P>
<P>New to apply this to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, &s;ince all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ankind had a common original fir&s;t, from A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and then from Noah and his &s;ons, it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to think they &s;hould have among them &s;ome memory of the chief facts in the Mo&s;aic hi&s;|tory, that were of common concernment; as the creation of the world, with the manner of it; the name of the fir&s;t man, the fir&s;t in&s;titutions or ordi|nances of religious wor&s;hip, the general &s;lood, and the like. It is not accountable that all the&s;e things &s;hould be utterly lo&s;t, and no foot&s;teps of them continue in the heathen nations, &s;ince they had the &s;ame original. So that what remains here to be done, is to enquire, what traditions we find of the &s;acred hi&s;tory among the heathen writers. Your attention I know would not accompany me, &s;hould I enlarge upon this head: and therefore, though I have taken &s;ome pains to collect what I can meet with relating to the &s;ubject, and which I am &s;en&s;i|ble
<PB N="85" REF="028262_0089_0FD7F4C852D57CC8">is of u&s;e for confirming our belief of the Bible. I &s;hall pa&s;s it over with &s;ome &s;hort and general hints.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t ancient and cele|brated hi&s;torian among the pagans, Sanchoniatho, has a great many in&s;tances of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory, and of the &s;tories related by Mo&s;es: as concerning the creation, the original of idolatry, the invention of arts, the foundation of cities, the calling of Abra|ham, and the like; in &s;o much, that Porphyry, an ancient philo&s;opher and a great enemy to chri&s;ti|anity, endeavors to e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of his hi&s;to|ry, from its agreement with that of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not de&s;cend to particulars, and trace all the pa&s;&s;ages that occur to our purpo&s;e. The fulle&s;t account that is given, by any one author, is in that learned book of Grotius, <HI>Of the truth of the chri&s;tian religion;</HI> an abridgment of which I &s;hall offer, as I find it prepared to my hands by an ingenious wri|ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Clark's evidence of natural and revealed religion, p. 279</NOTE> <Q>The manner of the formation of the earth out of a chaos is mentioned by the ancient Phae|nician, Egyptian, Indian and Greek authors: the name of Adam and Eve by Sanchoniatho and others: the longevity of the antedeluvians by Bero&s;us, Manetho, &amp;c.

Change the name of Deucalion for Noah, and Lu|cian's repre&s;entation of this matter is almo&s;t paral|lel to that of Mo&s;es; he tells you the fir&s;t genera|tion of men were de&s;troyed, and Deucalion was the progenitor of a &s;econd generation: he a&s;cribes their de&s;truction to their wickedne&s;s, and makes the means of it to be a flood of water; that Deu|calion and his family only were &s;aved, and that in
<PB N="88" REF="028262_0092_0FD7F4CC18278090">a great che&s;t, into which he came with his children, and with &s;everal animals; and that the deluge of water &s;unk into a great hiatus, or gap in the earth. The&s;e, and a great many more particulars of &s;crip|ture hi&s;tory, are commemorated among them, though changed and mangled in their fables. But any one, that has the Bible in his hands, may trace them in the &s;tories they tell.</P>
<P>I will only hint at two things more here, namely, that Mo&s;es was univer&s;ally owned among them, and celebrated as a lawgiver. Longinus mentions him as no ordinary man. Strabo &s;peaks of him with great commendation, and Diodorus Siculus places him among the chief lawgivers, Trogus Pompeius takes notice of his beauty and wi&s;dom, agreeably to the character Stephen gives of him in Acts vii. Farther, they had among them a great many religi|ous rites, which I think is evident, they derived from the Jews; as circumci&s;ion, &s;o famous among the I&s;hmaelites in Arabia. So their weekly &s;abbath, new moons, and above all, the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of &s;acrificing. The&s;e things were notorious among the heathen nations, and I look upon them as &s;o many foot&s;teps of the original laws given to the patriarchs and Jews, and atte&s;tations to the &s;acred hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And from the whole, without further rea&s;oning, I think I may infer with good evidence, that the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es is true. That they &s;peak of them &s;o fully as they do, and that there is &s;uch a general concurrence and agreement among them upon the main heads of the &s;acred hi&s;tory, I think can never be accounted for, but upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the hi&s;|tory is genuine and authentic. Whence &s;hould all the world have the&s;e notions of a chaos, of a crea|tion out of it, of the flood, of Abraham and the pa|triarchs, of Jewi&s;h rites? and whence &s;hould they take up the practice of &s;acrificing, which univer|&s;ally obtained among them, had not God appointed
<PB N="89" REF="028262_0093_0FD7F4CEC0DA3F18">it, and had it not come to them from the patriarchs and Jews? That the rea&s;on of mankind &s;hould agree in &s;uch a rite of wor&s;hip for appea&s;ing God, and recommending them&s;elves to his favor, is not imaginable. For how &s;hould they conclude, that the deity would be plea&s;ed with the de&s;truction and blood of any of his creatures. So that I think their opinions and &s;entiments, the &s;cattered frag|ments of the &s;acred hi&s;tory, that occur in the pagan writers, and their religious ob&s;ervances, are &s;o &s;trong a te&s;timony to the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, that no rea&s;on|able man can que&s;tion it, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill que&s;tion all hi&s;tory, and de&s;troy all the monu|ments of ancient facts, both &s;acred and profane.</P>
<P>If any a&s;k, whence had the gentiles their account of the&s;e things? I an&s;wer, in &s;hort, &s;ome of them might be had by tradition from the ancient patri|archs, from N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h and his &s;ons. Several things they might learn from the I&s;raelites during their &s;tay in Egypt. And they might get intelligence of &s;ome other particulars from the Jews them&s;elves, after their &s;ettlement in Canaan, and from their &s;acred Scriptures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The heathens may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had their knowledge of the&s;e matters &s;ome or all of the ways here hinted at. For mankind de&s;cending from one common father Noah, who we may be &s;ure carefully in&s;tructed all his children in the hi&s;tory of the world, the creation, fall, deluge, &amp;c. It is by no means likely, that the more remarkable pa&s;&s;ages concerning the&s;e great events &s;hould &s;oon be totally forgotten among any of his po&s;terity. Certainly they would be handed down from age to age, and &s;ome kind of tradition be pre&s;erved of them a con&s;iderable while, though indeed it is natural to imagine, it would by degrees be &s;o broken and altered, as exceedingly to di&s;gui&s;e the truth. Be&s;ides, one cannot but conclude, that during the long re&s;idence of the I&s;|raelites in Egypt they would communicate many things to the Egyptians, and others, who frequently corre&s;ponded with them. Without que&s;tion Jo&s;eph, and other good men, would improve the opportunity they had of &s;preading the knowledge of tho&s;e truths, which had been faithfully tran&s;mitted down to them from their excellent ance&s;tors the Patriarchs, and would take care to leave &s;ome la&s;ting memorials of them among a people they had &s;o much conver&s;ation with. And then the Gentiles undoubtedly de|rived a great many of their notions from the &s;acred oracles after|wards, both in Judea, whither &s;everal of them travelled for in|&s;truction, and in Egypt, where a multitude of the Jews, occa&s;ion|ally at lea&s;t, re&s;ided, and whence, the be&s;t records we have of tho&s;e times inform us, mo&s;t of the famous &s;ages and philo&s;ophers of old fetched their learning, as Solon, Thales, Pherecydes Syrus, Py|thagoras, Plato, &amp;c. That this was really the ca&s;e, we have the te&s;timony of the ancient Jews, chri&s;tians and heathens, as has been &s;hewn at large, and the matter of fact atte&s;ted, and clearly proved, by abundance of our mo&s;t learned modern writers, &s;uch as Scali|ger, Grotius, Bochart, Vo&s;&s;ius, Seldon, Huetius, Stilling fleet, Gale, and many others.</NOTE> as might be made appear highly pro|bable, but that I mu&s;t not enlarge upon the&s;e things.</P>

I mu&s;t yet beg your patience whil&s;t I touch the other part of the hi&s;tory of the Bible, that of the New Te&s;tament, as recorded by the four evange|li&s;ts, and in the acts of the apo&s;tles.

The &s;tar that appeared at his birth, is mentioned by Chalcidious the Platoni&s;t: as is al&s;o the journey of the Chaldaean wi&s;e men.

Many particulars of the collateral hi&s;tory concerning John the bapti&s;t, Herod and Pilate, are largely recorded by Jo&s;ephus: the crucifixion of Chri&s;t under Pontius Pilate, is related by Tacitus; and divers of the mo&s;t re|markable circum&s;tances attending it, &s;uch as the earthquake and miraculous darkne&s;s, was record|ed in the Roman regi&s;ters, and are in a very particular manner atte&s;ted by Phlegon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the mo&s;t con&s;iderable facts mentioned in the New Te&s;ta|ment are confirmed by the concurrent atte&s;tation of Jewi&s;h and heathen authors, might be made appear, by a much larger ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c|tion of particulars; but I chu&s;e to refer the inqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tive reader to Mr. Lardner's credibility of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e will meet with fall &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">faction upon this head; and in&s;tead of thinking it &s;trange, that we have no more and plainer corroborating te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|monies from tho&s;e writers to the matters of fact recorded in the go&s;pels, I am per&s;uaded, he will rather admire that we have &s;o many, and &s;uch clear ones, as we have. E&s;pecially con|&s;idering, how &s;eldom it was to their purpo&s;e to take nonce of the&s;e things, how unacquainted they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been with them for the mo&s;t part, and how little they believed them, having never impartially examined into their truth. In &s;hort, nothing &s;eems to me more unrea&s;onable than to urge the want of plainer and fuller te&s;timonies from heathens and Jews, to the facts on which the belief of the chri&s;tian religion is grounded, as an argument again&s;t it, when the very plainne&s;s and fullne&s;s of a te&s;timony of this &s;ort, is by many thought a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it to be &s;purious and counterfeit, the forgery of &s;ome over officious chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n. This is the ca&s;e with reference to that famous controverted pa&s;&s;age in Jo&s;ephus, the be&s;t argument that I know of produced again&s;t the genvinene&s;s of which is, that it contains an higher character of our &s;aviour than it is likely an unbelieving Jew would give. And as I doubt not the ca&s;e would have been the &s;ame in other in&s;tances, it mu&s;t needs be very unfair to make the paucity of &s;uch te&s;timonies an objection again&s;t chri&s;tianity. So that upon the whole, I think it manife&s;t, that we have as many and ju&s;t &s;uch as we could in rea&s;on look for and expect.</NOTE></Q> </P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="028262_0096_0FD7F4DEDBE6E9F0">
I might add to the&s;e te&s;timonies the acts of Pi|late, which though que&s;tioned by &s;ome, have I think a great probability in them. The ca&s;e was this: it was u&s;ual for the Roman deputies, or go|vernors of provinces, to give an account of the chief things, during their admini&s;tration, to the em|peror: accordingly, Pilate gave an account to Ti|berius of what had happened in his time concerning Je&s;us of Nazareth; an account of his miracles, death, crucifixion and re&s;urrection: upon which, it is &s;aid, that emperor propo&s;ed it to the &s;enate, that he &s;hould be admitted into the number of their gods; and decreed, that none &s;hould be accu&s;ed for being a chri&s;tian during his reign. Two things I may remark with reference to this matter, namely, that Pilate's account was enrolled in the public re|cords at Rome: and, that the fathers, as Ju&s;tin Martyr, and Tertullian afterwards appealed to the emperor and &s;enate upon the head, in their apolo|gies for the chri&s;tian religion. Which we cannot imagine they would have done, had they not been well a&s;&s;ured of the fact, that &s;uch things were re|gi&s;tered,
<PB N="93" REF="028262_0097_0FD7F4DFDFC87D68">and that their enemies had nothing to al|ledge in opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tion to it.</P>
<P>Now this was a te&s;timony of a public nature. Pilate, you know, was the judge before whom our Lord was tried, and by whom he was condemned. The thing was of &s;o great con&s;equence, and made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the world, that one cannot think he would pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence, and take no notice of it to the emperor. The fact is con&s;idered, the mat|ter laid before the &s;enate, and committed to their records; and thereupon a decree made in favor of the chri&s;tians. That this is likely to be true, may be argued from the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. The emperors expected from their deputies, an account of any notable event that happened where they were. And can we imagine, that Pilate either would or dur&s;t conceal &s;o great an event, as that concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t, about which all Judea was in an uproar, and in which he him&s;elf had &s;o great a &s;hare, From hence then, we may infer the pro|bability of the &s;tory; and, I think, conclude its certainty from the apologies I mentioned of Ju&s;tin Martyr and Tertullian. They were both learned men, lived in the next century, and I cannot think it con&s;i&s;tent with their character to appeal, as we find they do, to the head of the Roman empire, and to &s;o augu&s;t a body as the Roman &s;enate, concern|ing this fact had it been in the lea&s;t doubtful.</P>
<P>So that here you &s;ee, we have the te&s;timony of all &s;orts of authors in behalf of our point, of tho&s;e that lived in the time, and neare&s;t to the time, when the things mentioned in the New Te&s;tament hi&s;tory were done. The te&s;timony of enemies, of Jews, of Pagans, of the emperor and &s;enate, of Pilate, the very man that judged and condemned our Lord. All the&s;e own there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he lived at the time the go&s;pel relates, that he wrou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht miracles, that he was put to death
<PB N="94" REF="028262_0098_0FD7F5476B78D860">by crucifixion, that he had many di&s;ciples and fol|lowers, of who&s;e affairs &s;everal of them &s;peak. And it de&s;erves ob&s;ervation, that the mo&s;t &s;piteful ad|ver&s;aries of the chri&s;tian religion, and &s;uch as at|tacked it formerly with the greate&s;t &s;harpne&s;s, as Julian, Porphyry, and Cel&s;us, do not dare to deny the facts; they own what is &s;aid of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that he wrought miracles; only they pretend he did it by the power of magic, the Jews lay by the Tetragrammation, ju&s;t like the ab&s;urd cavil of his enemies in the days of his fle&s;h, that he ca&s;t out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.</P>
<P>You will allow me, I hope, to &s;ay now, that &s;o far I have made good what I undertook, and have &s;hewn you, that the characters of authentic hi&s;torians belong to the writers of the Bible; they have, you &s;ee, the te&s;timony of other ancient writers, even of their very enemies to confirm their hi&s;tory. The Old Te&s;tament has as much of this as could be ex|pected, and the New Te&s;tament more plain, direct, and early vouchers. So that I think I need not &s;cruple hence to conclude, that the Bible is cer|tainly true. But I have not yet given you all the evidence of its truth. I proceed therefore to the next particular, which I &s;hall di&s;patch in a few words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That the writers of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment treat of &s;ubjects of great importance, in which the intere&s;ts of men are very much concerned: in con&s;equence of which, we may conclude their relations of things would be examined by all &s;orts of per&s;ons: and yet none of the mo&s;t critical ex|aminers are able to di&s;prove them, or pretend they were fal&s;e. If any ancient hi&s;tory be a tri&s;le, con|tains things of no moment to the world, mankind will not think them&s;elves obliged to look very nar|rowly into it. Be it true or fal&s;e it is all one to them. When this is the ca&s;e, as it often is, no won|der
<PB N="95" REF="028262_0099_0FD7DAD0A2B06EA0">they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it pa&s;s, even though the greate&s;t part of it be fiction and romance.</P>
<P>But when a hi&s;tory comes forth full of great and &s;urpri&s;ing events, e&s;pecially of new laws and reve|lations in which the highe&s;t intere&s;ts of men are nearly concerned; we cannot imagine, it &s;hould be admitted without trial and &s;ufficient evidence. And of this nature is the hi&s;tory of the Bible, There is no hi&s;tory of equal weight with it, as may be &s;hewn with re&s;pect to both tho&s;e parts of it, I have already more than once touched upon.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, that contains the memoirs of the creation, the fall of man, the promi&s;e of a redeemer to recover lo&s;t &s;inners, the apo&s;tacy and de&s;truction of the old world, the pre&s;ervation of Noah and his family, as heads of a new race, the laws and covenant of God, and the wonders of his providence towards the church, has &s;omething in it not only great and augu&s;t, but of con&s;equence to the world above any other hi&s;tory. And though I grant the Jews being di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;eparate from the re&s;t of the world, their law was not of ge|neral and univer&s;al concernment; yet even their hi&s;tory, as well as that of the patriarchs, was &s;uch as would excite the attention of mankind; parti|cularly, as &s;o many things are related in it that give them a preference to the re&s;t of the nations, the mi|racles God wrought for them, the triumphs of his providence over their enemies, and in their behalf, in Egypt, in the wilderne&s;s, and afterwards in Ca|naan. Their neighbors and enemies could not be ignorant of many of the&s;e things, and had they been fal&s;e, would loudly have remon&s;trated again&s;t them. Would not the Egyptians have borne te&s;timony again&s;t what Mo&s;es lays of the de&s;truction of their monarch, and di&s;grace of their country by &s;o &s;trange a &s;eries and train of judgments, had there been any room to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dict his report? And yet we find no|thing
<PB N="96" REF="028262_0100_0FD7DAD206802388">of this, no counter hi&s;tory, but, as has been ob&s;erved, have evident foot&s;teps of the facts reci|ted by Mo&s;es, in their mo&s;t ancient records.</P>
<P>I need not &s;hew how important Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory was to the Jews, and that they could not have re|ceived it without examination. They would never have &s;ubmitted to Mo&s;es, had he been an impo&s;tor; would never have embraced his laws, had they not known they were divine, nor believed his hi&s;tory, if they had not been a&s;&s;ured it was true. When he delivers his law to them, he doth it in &s;trains of very high authority, and &s;ignifies to them that he &s;ets before them a ble&s;&s;ing and a cur&s;e. <HI>A ble&s;&s;ing if they obeyed, and a cur&s;e if they would not obey.</HI> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he &s;ays, <HI>I have &s;et before thee this day, life and good, and death and evil.</HI> And again, <HI>I call heaven and earth to record this day again&s;t you, that I have &s;et before you, life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing.</HI> He tells them, that <HI>if they walked in the &s;tatutes and judgments of God they &s;hould live and multiply, and God would ble&s;s them in the land whi|ther they went to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. But if their hearts turn|ed away and they would not hear,</HI> he &s;olemnly de|nounces to them, that <HI>they &s;hould &s;urely peri&s;h.</HI> And as their law came with &s;uch an awful &s;anction, &s;o the authority of it reached to all their affairs; their inheritances, civil rights, peace, health, and pro&s;perity of every kind, depended upon it. I might add, that though the whole hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es tends very much to exalt the mercy and grace of God towards that people, and &s;ets forth the won|ders of his providence done among them and for them, yet it leaves them under &s;evere cen&s;ures; it repre&s;ents them as a &s;tiff-necked, rebellious, un|grateful people; gives an account of their frequent murmurings and apo&s;tacies, and of the judgments of God inflicted upon them for their &s;ins; &s;ets a mark of infamy and reproach upon &s;ome eminent
<PB N="97" REF="028262_0101_0FD7DAD386EE42F0">per&s;ons and families among them, as Aaron, Miri|am, Corah, Dathan, Abiram and others.</P>
<P>Now had not this hi&s;tory been true, and known to be true beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of que&s;tion, had not the laws publi&s;hed been from God, the cen&s;ures pa&s;t been ju&s;t, the things related been done accor|ding to the revelation; as it had been in the power of a multitude to have confronted the deceiver and contradicted the &s;tory; they would not have failed to have done it. The account given of them was of too great con&s;equence to the community, and too nearly touched particular per&s;ons, to pa&s;s with|out examination, and to be received without ir|re&s;i&s;tible evidence.</P>
<P>As to the New Te&s;tament, every one will di&s;|cern the importance of its hi&s;tory and of the facts it contains; the incarnation, death, and re&s;urrec|tion of the Son of God, were the greate&s;t events that ever entertained the world, and could not but draw the attention of men, as we know they did. Con&s;ider the matter a little, Je&s;us of Nazareth an ob&s;cure per&s;on by his birth and education, a&s;&s;umes the character of the Me&s;liah; declares him&s;elf &s;ent and commi&s;&s;ioned by God the Father; and accor|dingly acts as his amba&s;&s;ador, repeals the &s;tatutes of Mo&s;es; condemns the forms of wor&s;hip that had &s;o long obtained among the gentiles, and calls upon them to renounce their idols; reveals a new doc|trine and plan of religion; works miracles and &s;ends forth apo&s;tles to preach his doctrine, and gives them al&s;o power of miracles to confirm that doctrine. He lays down his life, ri&s;es again from the dead, promi&s;es eternal happine&s;s to his follow|ers, and demands of all, as ever they expect an in|tere&s;t in his &s;alvation, that they believe in him, and &s;ubmit to his authority.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e were &s;uch very important things, of &s;o mighty con&s;equence to all &s;orts of per&s;ons, that I
<PB N="98" REF="028262_0102_0FD7DAD4E6B24BB8">think it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over with indolence and neglect. Here was a new &s;tate of religion introduced, the venerable rights of Mo|&s;es cancelled, the &s;uper&s;titions of the Pagans tram|pled under foot, and not only &s;o, but the reputati|on both of the one and the other &s;truck at. For to &s;ay nothing of any other in&s;tances of their con|duct &s;et forth and cen&s;ured in the &s;acred hi&s;tory, we find they are repre&s;ented there as acting a &s;can|dalous part in the tragedy of Chri&s;t's death, the Jews per&s;ecuting and delivering him up for envy. and Pilate condemning him again&s;t the conviction of his own con&s;cience. The former, the Jews, &s;eem apprehen&s;ive how much their credit was touched in the matter, and therefore endeavored to &s;ilence the apo&s;tles and &s;tifle their report, alledging they had <HI>filled Jeru&s;alem with their doctrine, and intended to bring this man's blood</HI> upon them. So that had there been room for cavilling, any pre|tence upon which they might hope to invalidate the te&s;timony of the &s;acred writers, their malice, nay, a concern for their own reputation, would have put them upon it. They were avowed enemies to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, nothing galled them &s;o much as the fame of his miracles, and the &s;preading of his doc|trine thereupon; and we may be &s;ure as they did ob&s;erve the&s;e things, they would not let them go without contradiction, but that there was no ground for it.</P>
<P>As for chri&s;tians, the whole body of chri&s;tians, they were &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in the facts recorded in the go&s;pel, that it is certain they could not ne|glect them. They profe&s;&s;ed to believe the go&s;pel hi&s;tory and indeed ventured their all, their pre&s;ent and everla&s;ting all, upon the credit thereof. They could not be chri&s;tians without believing, nor be|lieve, ordinarily, without being martyrs. Their ma&s;ter made the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and their enemies
<PB N="99" REF="028262_0103_0FD7DAD6676649D8">the latter. Chri&s;t would not accept them unle&s;s they would own him, confe&s;s him, and be faithful to him: and if they did &s;o their enemies generally per&s;ecuted them, even unto death.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of the &s;acred hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory. It relates matters of the greate&s;t importance to mankind, wherein their highe&s;t intere&s;ts are immediately concerned; and con&s;equently, they could not but think them&s;elves obliged to enquire narrowly into it, as actually they did: and after their utmo&s;t examination, none were able to deny the facts, or de&s;troy the credit of the hi&s;tory: from whence I may conclude, it is un|doubtedly true.</P>
<P>It was not po&s;&s;ible to forge &s;uch an hi&s;tory as that of Mo&s;es and of Chri&s;t, and per&s;uade man|kind to believe the &s;ame. The rea&s;on is, they were too much concerned in the&s;e things, not to exam|ine whether they were true or not. There are many ancient hi&s;tories of &s;o little moment to any part of mankind, that no body thinks it worth his while critically to enquire into all the particulars of them; and therefore no wonder that &s;ome &s;uch pa&s;s current, whatever fictions there may be in them. But when the hi&s;tory is of general and great moment and importance the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e. Should any one for in&s;tance, pretend to give us an hi&s;tory of our own nation, or but of the reign of one of our kings, wherein a great many facts are forged, and a great multitude of &s;tories told again&s;t the in|tere&s;t and reputation of any con&s;iderable party. And &s;hould he moreover alter public laws, and go about to impo&s;e a new &s;tatute book; I a&s;k, whether &s;uch an hi&s;tory could po&s;&s;ibly obtain any credit, and &s;uch an attempt &s;ucceed among us? would not thou&s;ands ri&s;e up and detect the impo&s;ture? or ra|ther the attempt would &s;ink and ruin it&s;elf by the
<PB REF="028262_0104_0FD7DAD8A1E72748">ab&s;urdity and impudence of it. The &s;ame may be &s;aid with reference to an abu&s;e and forgery of the records in the Bible. No man could have con|trived &s;uch a book, with &s;uch laws and facts, with|out expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the contempt of the world, of Jews, Pagans and Chri&s;tians. England may as &s;oon be per&s;uaded to receive a forged body of &s;tatutes never enacted in parliament, nor pleaded in any court of judicature, as the Jewi&s;h and chri&s;|tian church could have been per&s;uaded to receive the laws and hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es and Chri&s;t, from the hands of an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>And thus I have gone through the fir&s;t of the three particulars I propo&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon; have &s;hown you, that the &s;acred hi&s;tory has equal credit with any ancient hi&s;tory, and that all the characters of credible hi&s;torians belong to the writers of the Bible. They had &s;ufficient knowledge of what they wrote; they were per&s;ons of great integrity; they wrote at the time when the facts they publi&s;h are &s;aid to be done, and when it might be known whether they were done or no; their hi&s;tory is confirmed by co-temporary writers, and the things, they relate, are of &s;o much importance to mankind, that they could not but think them&s;elves obliged to enquire into them. From whence it follows, that either the Bible is true, or we can have no evidence that there is any true hi&s;tory in the world.</P>
<P>And now to conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with a prac|tical remark, or inference from what has been &s;aid. If the Bible is true, then on the one hand, how &s;ad and deplorable is the ca&s;e of wic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d men; of car|nal, worldly, &s;en&s;ual &s;inners. The Bible is wholly again&s;t them. It cen&s;ures their principles, con|demns their practice, repre&s;ents God as their ene|my, and hell as their portion. Which, by the way, I doubt is one great rea&s;on of many per&s;ons' enmity to the Bible. It checks and controuls them in
<PB N="101" REF="028262_0105_0FD7DAFFB1643210">their &s;inful pur&s;uits, and did they believe it, would exceedingly terrify them. Hence they hate it, as Ahab did the prophet, becau&s;e it &s;peaks evil to them. If the Bible be true, <HI>the way of the ungodly &s;hall peri&s;h, and the wicked &s;hall be turned into hell.</HI> On the other hand, we have hence matter of great joy and comfort to good men. It is &s;o much our intere&s;t that the Bible &s;hould be true, that methinks tho&s;e that are inclined to que&s;tion, whether it is, or not, &s;hould yet wi&s;h it true. And indeed was that the ca&s;e with the oppo&s;ers of it, I do not doubt but their &s;cruples would &s;oon be over, and the di&s;pute cea&s;e.</P>
<P>A good man would not for the world that the Bible was not true. He finds there &s;o much &s;atis|faction concerning God and providence, as govern|ing all things and intere&s;ting him&s;elf in all his af|fairs; &s;o much a&s;&s;urance concerning another better &s;tate, &s;o much &s;upport and comfort in this, that he ju&s;tly e&s;teems his Bible his inheritance and trea|&s;ure. Rejoice then, chri&s;tian, that we have &s;uch good evidence of the truth of it. There thou ha&s;t a glorious revelation, <HI>a &s;ure word of prophecy,</HI> ex|cellent rules to direct thy practice, exceeding great and precious promi&s;es to afford thee comfort, and a certain pro&s;pect of eternal life hereafter. O be thankful for the Bible; &s;tudy, love, and live the Bible; and you &s;hall find all true at la&s;t, and that not one iota, or tittle of the word &s;hall pa&s;s till all be accompli&s;hed.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE made it appear, I think, that our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient hi&s;tory, and con&s;equently, that if it be not true, we have no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to receive and believe any ancient book in the world. And according to the me|thod I propo&s;ed, I am now</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew that our Bible has greater marks of credibility, &s;tronger evidences of truth, than any other ancient book. I might argue this at large; but I &s;hall content my&s;elf with a few ob&s;ervations. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The writers of the Bible &s;eem to have excel|led other hi&s;torians in their moral character. They appear to have been per&s;ons of eminent integrity, goodne&s;s and virtue; and di&s;cover in all their writings, the greate&s;t impartiality, and love of truth. Compare them in the&s;e things with mo&s;t hi&s;torians in the world, and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee on which &s;ide the advantage will be.</P>
<P>To touch only on their impartiality; how glo|riou&s;ly does that &s;hine through all their narrations. Mo&s;es fully relates the evil things of his nation;
<PB N="104" REF="028262_0107_0FD7DB08AF93A448">both their &s;ins and their &s;ufferings; their offences again&s;t God, and his judgments upon them. Nor doth he &s;pare him&s;elf, he records &s;everal in&s;tances of his own infirmities, and tells you, that God was angry with him and Aaron, and for their &s;ins ex|cluded them out of the promi&s;ed land. The New Te&s;tament writers repre&s;ent their ma&s;ter under all the di&s;advantageous characters of a &s;ufferer, as load|ed with reproach and contempt, and at la&s;t under|going an ignominious death. And I before took notice, they do with gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t freedom &s;et forth their weakne&s;&s;es; their cowardi&s;e, &s;lowne&s;s of belief, their pride and emulations; the many rebukes they met with from their ma&s;ter, and their &s;hameful for|&s;aking him, and denying him in his la&s;t &s;ufferings. It is left on record again&s;t the great apo&s;tle Paul, that he con&s;enter to the death of Stephen, and made havoc of the church; on which account, he calls him&s;elf the <HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ef of &s;inners, a per&s;ecutor, a bla&s;|phemer, and injurious.</HI> And when he mentions that glorious and di&s;tingui&s;hing in&s;tance of favor to him, his rapture into the third heaven, he doth it with &s;uch circum&s;tances as tend to mortify him; for he tells us thereupon, <HI>God &s;ent a thorn in the fle&s;h, a me&s;&s;enger of Satan to buffet him, le&s;t he &s;hould be ex|alted above mea&s;ure.</HI> This and the like, way the conduct of the&s;e men from fir&s;t to la&s;t, as might be made out in a multitude of in&s;tances. But it is &s;uf|ficient to &s;ay, there never were in the world more candid fair writers; per&s;ons that acted a more di&s;|intere&s;ted part than the writers of the Bible. Bring other writers to the te&s;t, hear and examine their characters, compare them to that of Mo&s;es and the apo&s;tles, and I am confident &s;ew can bear the trial. The common hi&s;torians mu&s;t fall before them, as <HI>Dagon before the ark of God.</HI></P>
<P>What gro&s;s fables the Greek and Roman hi&s;to|rians mixed with their hi&s;tories, on pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;e to ag|grandi&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="028262_0108_0FD7DB0B67DC0678">and rai&s;e the &s;ame of their own nations, has been taken notice of; at the &s;ame time, omitting what&s;oever tended to their diminution. Among other in&s;tances, this is remarkable, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hi&s;t. l. 34. c. 14.</NOTE> Por&s;ena, in his league with the people of Rome, obliged them to make no other u&s;e of iron, but for the tilling the ground, none of the Roman hi&s;torians think fit to relate this circum&s;tance; whereas, when the people of I&s;rael were reduced to the like &s;traits, their hi&s;torian freely owns it. And even Jo&s;ephus, the celebrated Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian, pa&s;&s;es over in &s;i|lence &s;everal things di&s;honorable to his nation; particularly, their folly in making the golden calf. But the &s;acred writers have none of the&s;e blemi&s;hes upon them, none of the&s;e objections lying again&s;t them. They &s;ought not their own glory, the ho|nor of their own nation, their friends, their party; but appear in all they &s;ay and do, to act from no other principle but love and zeal for the truth.</P>
<P>Not but there are a great many hi&s;tories wrote by very hone&s;t and &s;incere per&s;ons, who had no de|&s;ign in any particular to impo&s;e upon the world; but as good men, the be&s;t of men, are in all things fallible, it many things prejudiced; &s;o none of them could come up to the manife&s;t character of the writers of the Bible. The&s;e have been actuated by an higher &s;pirit, have di&s;covered a purer zeal, a more &s;teady, uniform, divine intention in their compo&s;ures. Allow me therefore again to repeat the corrollary and con&s;equence from hence, that if we do not admit the Bible, we mu&s;t give up all other hi&s;tories as legend and juggle.</P>
<P N="2">2. It adds to the credit of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory, and gives it the pre&s;erence to all others, that, as I remarked before, it contains matters the mo&s;t weigh|ty and important of any in the world. It treats of things of &s;uch a nature, that all mankind, before
<PB N="106" REF="028262_0109_0FD7DB0D264E4258">whom it was laid, would think them&s;elves bound to look into it, and fift it to the bottom. There is no other hi&s;tory like to undergo &s;o critical a &s;cruti|ny as the &s;acred; the rea&s;ons of which, I have al|ready hinted at: and, I think, I may ju&s;tly alledge it as a circum&s;tance in favor of the Bible, and as what gives it a &s;uperior credit to any other ancient book.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;cripture hi&s;tory has had more enemies than any other, and has &s;tood the te&s;t of the mo&s;t nice c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">iry: &s;ome of it &s;everal thou&s;and years, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal hundred. The Jews and chri&s;|tians have e&s;pou&s;ed their re&s;pective &s;acred hi&s;to|ries, upon full conviction of the truth of each. Their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have from age to age, and for a great cract of time, acquie&s;ced therein as &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed. Nor have their enemies, for &s;o long a while, been able to di&s;cover any fraud, or cheat in the &s;acred writings, notwith&s;tanding their utmo&s;t efforts.</P>
<P>If it be objected, That the adver&s;aries of chri&s;ti|anity might confute the&s;e things at the time they are &s;aid to be done, though we have not now the ac|count of that matter. I an&s;wer
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. We have no proof, no records remaining of any &s;uch confuta|tion. Let the objector name by whom this was done, or undertaken; produce any tradition of &s;uch a fact, any book wrote on &s;uch a &s;ubject. If he cannot, there is nothing in the allegation, but it mu&s;t be looked upon as a mere cavil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is evi|dent, the enemies of the Bible never pretended to confute or deny the facts therein reported; for in|&s;tance, the miracles of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. On the contrary, you find &s;ome of them freely confe&s;&s;|ing them. <HI>What &s;hall we do,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>to the&s;e men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manife&s;t to all them that dwell in Jeru&s;alem; and we cannot deny it.</HI> Should the objector turn upon me, and &s;ugge&s;t, that I am producing the te&s;timony
<PB N="107" REF="028262_0110_0FD7DB0F8C8B6530">of a book under di&s;pute, that it is only the Scrip|ture it&s;elf that tells us this. I reply, the&s;e facts are owned by the heathens and Jews of that time, as has been proved. And be&s;ides, the Jews &s;ince do not pretend to deny them; but plead, that Chri&s;t wrought miracles by the power of magic, or by the my&s;terious u&s;e of the Tetragrammaton, the name Jehovah. I an&s;wer further,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Had there been any &s;uch confutation of the facts in the Bible, the Jews, no doubt, would have pre&s;erved the te&s;ti|mony or writings of &s;uch oppo&s;ers; would have made u&s;e of them in their di&s;putes again&s;t chri&s;ti|anity; which yet they never did. So that, I con|clude, this character, this &s;uperior character of the credit and truth of the Bible, is unque&s;tionable. No other ancient book has been &s;o much examined and critici&s;ed upon, and &s;tood the attacks of ene|mies &s;o long and &s;o much.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="4">4. The Scripture hi&s;tory receives a mighty con|firmation from the concord and harmony of its &s;e|veral writers. It was wrote by &s;everal per&s;ons, in &s;everal parts and ages of the world, and every one gives te&s;timony to another; which is a circum&s;tance that cannot be alledged with the like advantage in behalf of any other book or hi&s;tory. Mo&s;es &s;peaks and writes of Chri&s;t, as he him&s;elf tells us, John v. 46. and in his types and prophecies points out and delineates the great events of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation in his &s;ong. <HI>He hath rai&s;ed up an horn of &s;alvation for us in the hou&s;e of his &s;ervant David; as he &s;pake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been &s;ince the world began.</HI> So Acts iii. 24. <HI>And all the prophets from Samuel and tho&s;e that follow after, as many as have &s;poken have foretold of the&s;e days.</HI> Mo|&s;es and the prophets give te&s;timony to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; foretell and de&s;cribe the things thereof. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> go&s;pel owns Mo&s;es and the prophets and gives
<PB N="108" REF="028262_0111_0FD7F4E30ABCBBC8">te&s;timony to them. So that it is a good argument, that if any part of the Bible be true, all is true; if Mo&s;es be true, the prophets be true, the New Te&s;|tament is true: and on the other hand, if the New Te&s;tament be true, &s;o are Mo&s;es and the prophets. They have a mutual dependance and give mutual te&s;timony. They &s;tand or fall together. An ar|gument that will &s;erve no other book or hi&s;tory in the world, at lea&s;t not &s;o fully as the Bible. I might add,</P>
<P N="5">5. God him&s;elf hath owned this hi&s;tory, and gi|ven it a divine te&s;timony in a manner, that cannot be pleaded in behalf of any other hi&s;tory. He has owned this book to be his; owned the penman of it, and vindicated its truth and authority. But as this belongs to another argument and will be after|wards con&s;idered as a proof of the in&s;piration of the Bible, I &s;hall not here in&s;i&s;t upon it. In the mean time it may fitly be ob&s;erved as one of the particulars that give the Bible a preference to all other books.</P>
<P>And this may &s;uffice for the evidence of the &s;e|cond particular, that the Bible has &s;uperior marks of credit and truth in it above any other hi&s;tory. It remains according to what I promi&s;ed,</P>
<P N="3">III. That I &s;hew, that all circum&s;tances con&s;i|dered, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible the Bible &s;hould not be true. I &s;ay morally, by which I di&s;tingui&s;h the impo&s;&s;ibility I &s;peak of, from that which is &s;trict and ab&s;olute, ari&s;ing from the nature of things. All human under&s;tandings are, and will be, imper|fect. If we have the te&s;timony of one man, of an hundred, of a thou&s;and, concerning this or that particular, we may have great rea&s;on to believe this or that te&s;timony. But it implies not contra|diction when any &s;ay, it is fal&s;e. But notwith&s;tand|ing this, there may be &s;uch a concurrence of cir|cum&s;tances in a te&s;timony or an hi&s;tory concerning
<PB N="109" REF="028262_0112_0FD7F4E414CD2648">pa&s;t things, as renders it not only highly rea&s;onable to believe it, but even impo&s;&s;ible to be fal&s;e with|out changing the faculties and nature of man, and the &s;tate of things among mankind. And of this kind, I think, is the evidence we have, that the Scripture contains a true hi&s;tory. It is I &s;ay, with the di&s;tinction mentioned, impo&s;&s;ible the Bible &s;hould be fal&s;e. To confirm which po&s;ition, I &s;hall offer a few con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not po&s;&s;ible that the writers of the Bible &s;hould be deceived them&s;elves. They had the help of all their &s;en&s;es and faculties to enable them to di&s;cern whether the things they publi&s;hed were true or not. And if &s;o many per&s;ons, in &s;o many dif|ferent ca&s;es, were not enabled to make a judgment about what they relate, having all of them their &s;en&s;es and the u&s;e of their rea&s;on; others in the like circum&s;tances may be deceived, you and I, and ten thou&s;and more, and con&s;equently nothing can be certain in the world.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es could not but know, whether he had been with Pharaoh, treating with him time after time in the manner he reports. He could not but know, whether he u&s;ed his rod for the working &s;uch mira|cles as are contained in his hi&s;tory; he could not but know whether he had been on the mount with God, and received two tables of &s;tone from God there; whether he brought them down in his hands, broke them at the foot of the mount, and had them afterwards renewed. The New Te&s;tament writers could not but tell, whether they had &s;een Chri&s;t, heard his di&s;cour&s;es, been witne&s;&s;es of his miracles, &s;een him hang on the cro&s;s, conver&s;ed with him after his re&s;urrection, and &s;een him a&s;cend into heaven; they could not but know, whether they had wrought the miracles they give an account of; and, particularly, could not but know &s;uch as were wrought upon them&s;elves, as their &s;peaking with
<PB N="110" REF="028262_0113_0FD7F4E603D838F0">tongues they had never learned; they might know as certainly, whether they received the miraculous gift of languages at Penteco&s;t, as they knew their own exi&s;tence. To &s;uppo&s;e, that a multitud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of per&s;ons, and that of all &s;orts, &s;hould be deceived in things of this kind; is to de&s;troy the nature of man, deny that he is a rea&s;onable creature, capable of moral government, and reflects the utmo&s;t di&s;honor upon God, the author of his nature. I may there|fore conclude, it is impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould be them&s;elves deceived. If what they wrote was fal&s;e, they knew it was fal&s;e, and they could not but know, whether it was true or fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. As they could not be deceived them&s;elves, &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould mean and intend to de|ceive others. For,

<ITEM>1. I have &s;hewn they were per|&s;ons of great integrity and truth. The characters thereof were con&s;picuous in all they &s;aid and did.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They were under great obligations to &s;peak the truth. Nothing is more contrary to the religion they propagated, and the doctrine they taught, than lying; not &s;o much as a pious fraud, an officious lie, was allowed by them. When a thing of that kind was imputed to them, they rejected it with ab|horrence, <HI>If the truth of God,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why yet am I al&s;o judged as a &s;inner? and not rather as we be &s;landerou&s;ly reported, and as &s;ome affirm that we &s;ay, let us do evil that good may come; who&s;e damna|tion is ju&s;t.</HI> And you every where find a mark of reprobation &s;et upon lying in &s;cripture, and &s;uch as indulge to that vice, appointed to de&s;truction. Thus we are told, <HI>All liars &s;hall have their portion in the lake, which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI> Now is it po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould invent a lie, &s;o prodigious and bla&s;phemous a lie, as that of the go&s;pel, if it be fal&s;e? Invent, publi&s;h, and palm it upon the world in the name of God: that
<PB N="111" REF="028262_0114_0FD7F4E71E2744D0">they &s;hould do this in contradiction to their mani|fe&s;t character and avowed doctrine? He that will impute this to them, makes them the mo&s;t &s;elf-con|tradicting, &s;elf-condemned men in the world.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They could have no motive to &s;uch a vile under|taking. It was again&s;t their worldly intere&s;t; as is evident to any one that knows their ca&s;e, and reads their hi&s;tory. What the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays of him|&s;elf, was true of all of them: Chri&s;t had forewarn|ed them of it, and they expected it, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>bonds and afflictions</HI> did abide them. They were a&s;&s;ured, that to follow Chri&s;t in hopes of another world, was the certain way to be undone in this; that they &s;hould be hated of all men for his name-&s;ake, &s;cour|ged, every way per&s;ecuted even unto blood and death. If it be &s;aid, they had not much to lo&s;e, I an&s;wer, &s;ome of them left a very comfortable &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Matthew was a toll-gatherer, an officer of the cu&s;toms, and, no que&s;tion, was in the way, not only of living, but growing rich in &s;ome mea&s;ure. Luke was a phy&s;ician, and the apo&s;tle Paul was in &s;o much e&s;teem among the great men of the Jew|i&s;h church, and &s;o much devoted to their intere&s;t, was &s;o learned, exact, and zealous in his profe&s;&s;ion, that he might have expected con&s;iderable prefer|ments: all which he chearfully renounced, account|ing all, as he tells us, not only lo&s;s, but dung for Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. The re&s;t of the apo&s;tles in|deed were fi&s;hermen; but we are told they had hi|red &s;ervants, which implies, their circum&s;tances were not very mean, at lea&s;t not nece&s;&s;itous. But the argument is not concerned in this. Whatever their former circum&s;tances were, it is certain, they could not propo&s;e to mend them by following Chri&s;t. If they had but little, that little mu&s;t be much with them, becau&s;e it was their all; and no man can lo&s;e more than all. Nor did they only quit their livelihood and means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but their ea&s;e,
<PB N="112" REF="028262_0115_0FD7F4E8E2A71FD0">their outward peace and their life was &s;acrificed for the &s;ame cau&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now I think it not po&s;&s;ible, had they been con|&s;cious of a lie, and that the go&s;pel was a forgery, that they &s;hould have promoted it upon &s;uch terms. They could have no motive, no temptation hereto; and con&s;equently to &s;uppo&s;e them guilty of this, is to &s;uppo&s;e them to have abandoned the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and &s;elf-love, to do evil for evil-&s;ake: not only without, but again&s;t their own intere&s;t; and to contrive the mo&s;t enormous wick|edne&s;s, for no other rea&s;on, but to be mi&s;erable here and damned hereafter, which I reckon impo&s;&s;ible, as not being con&s;i&s;tent with any principles of hu|man nature that we are acquainted with. If there ever were any that did &s;uch things as the&s;e, they mu&s;t not be men, but another &s;pecies of creatures than we have any idea or notion of.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that honor and reputation might &s;et them at work. I an&s;wer, that ob&s;cure per&s;ons, &s;uch as were the fir&s;t propagators of the go&s;pel, and pub|li&s;hers of its hi&s;tory, are &s;eldom pu&s;hed on to great enterpri&s;es, upon motives of honor and vain glory. They have little &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things. Be&s;ides, they could have no expectation of honor from the world. They were told of hatred, of reproach; of the mo&s;t infamous, barbarous u&s;age. And they &s;aw that mu&s;t be their lot, if they engaged in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t. So that, I may conclude, it was not po&s;&s;ible the&s;e men &s;hould de&s;ign a cheat and impo&s;ture. They mu&s;t know the truth and goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;ed, or they had never e&s;pou&s;ed it. Again, 1. I think it altogether unaccountable, and indeed impo&s;&s;ible, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome particular per&s;ons, &s;hould be capable of &s;o much wickedne&s;s and vilene&s;s, that &s;o many of them &s;hould agree therein, and that none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them &s;hould detect the villainy. All &s;orts of per&s;ons, Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<PB N="113" REF="028262_0116_0FD7F4ED79473540">pagans, multitudes of both, were engaged in the profe&s;&s;ion and &s;ervice of the go&s;pel. They had their different &s;entiments, divided into parties, run into debates, and mutual cen&s;ures and &s;chi&s;ms: &s;ome fell into hera&s;ies, and were publicly cen&s;ured by the churches, and excommunicated. The apo&s;tle Paul him&s;elf had zealous enemies that endeavored to ruin his reputation, among the Corinthians, Gala|tions and others; again&s;t whom he was forced to write with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s, for the vindicating him|&s;elf and e&s;tabli&s;hing the churches. Now, what I remark is, that among all the&s;e per&s;ons, this mul|titude of converts, too often drawn up in factions one again&s;t another; full of animo&s;ities, bicker|ings, party heats and quarrels, none of them ever undertook to accu&s;e chri&s;tianity of impo&s;ture, or to di&s;cover any deceit of confederacy among the profe&s;&s;ors of it. Think of the ca&s;e of Judas here particularly. You know he betrayed his ma&s;ter, &s;old him for thirty pieces of &s;ilver. Now, either he knew that Chri&s;t was an impo&s;tor, and the go&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a forgery or not. If he knew it, would he not upon this account have proclaimed the thing to all the world, and thereby vindicated his own honor? but &s;o far was he from it, that you know con&s;cience flew in his face, and he comes to his abettors with a &s;orrowful complaint, <HI>I have betrayed innocent blood,</HI> and not being able to bear the load of &s;o much guilt as he found pre&s;&s;ing his mind; he throws down the money, goes his way, and hangs him&s;elf. Certainly, had the go&s;pel been fal&s;e, the device of &s;ome cunning men, one or other would have &s;poke out; the provoked and enraged; the apo&s;tates, &s;uch as Judas, particularly would have done it. It is not, I think, po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould all per&s;evere in a lie, a known lie; and neither the love of truth, nor love of them&s;elves, nor hatred of &s;uch as they accounted enemies, prevail with them
<PB N="114" REF="028262_0117_0FD7F4F8C2DB1440">to make a di&s;covery. To which I might &s;ubjoin, that multitudes of the&s;e per&s;ons carried their te&s;ti|mony to the truth of chri&s;tianity with them to death, &s;ealing it with their very blood: no fears, no terrors of their enemies, nor remor&s;e of con&s;ci|ence, could make them draw back or recant.</P>
<P>Now all this con&s;idered, I pre&s;ume, I may &s;ay, it is not to be accounted for, it is not agreeable to any thing we know of the human nature; and that indeed it amounts to an impo&s;&s;ibility, that there &s;hould be any fraudulent de&s;ign, in the writers and preachers of the go&s;pel. They could never, &s;o ma|ny of them thus have agreed, and thus have per|&s;i&s;ted in a known lie and fal&s;hood. And then as they could not be deceived or de&s;ign to deceive, &s;o</P>
<P N="3">3. It was not po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be able to de|ceive others. Had the writers of the &s;cripture in|tended, and endeavored, to have impo&s;ed their hi&s;|tory upon the world, they could not have &s;ucceeded in the attempt. This may be &s;ufficiently collected from what has been &s;aid. I &s;hall however remark two or three things for the proof of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. They had not art enough to manage an im|po&s;ture. The apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t particularly had not. Their education was low and mean; they were not bred up in the courts of princes, or in the &s;chools of the philo&s;ophers; but were taken from the fi&s;her-boat mo&s;t of them to preach the go&s;pel; and &s;ome have ob&s;erved, their employment tended to make them more heavy and dull; for being much upon the water, and in the night, the cold phlegmatic air would have an influence upon them and flatten their &s;pirits. Hence Plato, when he would expre&s;s a rude dull man, &s;ays he was brought up among mariners. Add to this, that they lay un|der di&s;advantages from their country, being Galli|leans, who&s;e dialect was accounted the mo&s;t ungen|teel and rude of any; a Gallilean, was a term of
<PB N="115" REF="028262_0118_0FD7F4FAAFC91FB0">diminution, a &s;ort of a nick-name, by which they meant a mean and contemptible ru&s;tic.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, view them in all their circum&s;tances, and it will appear impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch per&s;ons, &s;up|po&s;ing they have the confidence and folly to un|dertake a cheat of this nature, &s;hould ever be able to carry it on. Their enemies took notice they were ignorant and unlearned men. They had nei|ther depth of under&s;tanding, nor fluency of &s;peech, were neither &s;cholars, nor orators. And is it to be imagined, that they &s;hould be able of their own heads to contrive &s;uch a &s;tory, as that of the go&s;|pel hi&s;tory? and not only &s;o, but per&s;uade others to receive it?</P>
<P N="2">2. They relate facts of &s;uch a nature, that it is not po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have cheated the world into the belief of them, had they not been true. For in&s;tance, they give an account of facts done before a multitude of witne&s;&s;es, who could not but know whether &s;uch things were done, and in that manner done or not. Let us con&s;ider, among many other in&s;tances, the pa&s;&s;age of Chri&s;t's crucifixion with the circum&s;tances of it; that at the time of the pa&s;&s;over when there was a mighty concour&s;e of people at Jeru&s;alem, he was condemned by Pilate again&s;t his con&s;cience, and publicly put to death; that the vail of the temple was thereupon rent, the rocks &s;plit, graves opened, and there was a preter|natural darkne&s;s over the land for &s;everal hours; and all this was done, as they pretend, before great numbers of &s;pectators, both Jews and Romans. Now, if the&s;e things really were done, as is repre|&s;ented in the go&s;pel, our point is &s;o far gained, the hi&s;tory is true. If fal&s;e, why did not their ene|mies contradict them; e&s;pecially &s;ince the honor of &s;ome of them was &s;o nearly touched. If this &s;tory be fal&s;e, and Chri&s;t was not crucified, and &s;uch
<PB N="116" REF="028262_0119_0FD7F4FAB4D2FEB8">and &s;uch events did not happen at the time of his crucifixion, it is impo&s;&s;ible the apo&s;tles &s;hould have gained credit to the forgery.</P>
<P>The like I might &s;ay of abundance of miracles recorded in the go&s;pel. Let us reflect a little on the rai&s;ing of Lazarus from the dead, an account of which you have in the eleventh of John: where you will ob&s;erve he was not only dead, but buried four days; this was publicly known in the neigh|borhood: and therefore &s;everal of the Jews came to the &s;i&s;ters of the decea&s;ed to pay them a friendly vi&s;it, and to condole with them: upon this you are told of a conference between Chri&s;t and Martha; and read of the de&s;pair they were in of receiving any help with reference to their brother: yet not|with&s;tanding Chri&s;t goes to the grave, calls upon the dead man, and immediately he comes forth. Thereupon, as the hi&s;tory goes on, many of the Jews believed in him. Others lay the matter be|fore the Phari&s;ees, who immediately &s;ummon a council, and being alarmed with the report of &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a miracle, to prevent the con&s;equence they feared from it, determine to put Je&s;us to death. <HI>What do we?</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>for this man doth many mira|cles, and if we let him alone all men will believe on him.</HI> And you read in the following chapter, they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame re&s;olution with reference to Laza|rus; the fame of the miracle encrea&s;ing, people flocked to &s;ee the dead man now alive, and many believed on Je&s;us, by rea&s;on of Lazarus. Hence they thought it nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould be di&s;|patched out of the way too, and be put to death. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory, and I think I may warrantably conclude, without much rea&s;on|ing upon it, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make it pa&s;s current had it been fal&s;e. Here are a great many per&s;ons introduced, as having a part in the &s;cene, Lazarus, his &s;i&s;ters, the Jews; &s;ome of whom are
<PB N="117" REF="028262_0120_0FD7F4FC18276538">repre&s;ented as convinced, and others as taking di&s;|honorable methods to &s;lur the miracle and di&s;grace the author. Lazarus lives as a &s;tanding monument of the divine power of Chri&s;t; multitudes are car|ried by their curio&s;ity to &s;ee and conver&s;e with &s;o remarkable a per&s;on; and of the&s;e many are con|verted, and profe&s;s faith in Je&s;us as the Me&s;&s;iah. Now what I in&s;i&s;t on is, that had this &s;tory been fal&s;e, it could never have been admitted as true. Lazarus him&s;elf, we may &s;uppo&s;e, would have de|nied that he had been dead, and was rai&s;ed to life again; his &s;i&s;ters, the Jews, would have been ready to have cried out of the impo&s;ture. And upon the whole, I think it is not po&s;&s;ible, circum&s;tances con|&s;idered, that all of them &s;hould have &s;uffered a for|gery of this nature to remain undetected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the occa&s;ion of what is here tran&s;iently &s;aid concerning the re&s;urrection of Lazarus, I cannot forbear remarking, that this is one of the miracles of our &s;aviour that Mr. Wool&s;ton has lately endeavored to di&s;credit as much as he can; though was it a pro|per place to enlarge upon the &s;ubject, it would be no difficult mat|ter to &s;hew the weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity of his exceptions and cavils. But as the di&s;cour&s;e comes in here occa&s;ionally, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent &s;tand to take notice of what he &s;ays. Only, I think, I may be allowed to ob&s;erve, that the hints given in this paragraph are &s;ufficient to vindicate the matter of fact, and manife&s;t the re|ality of the miracle. But if any de&s;ire to &s;ee the ca&s;e confidered more particularly, I would recommend to their peru&s;al the Rev. Dr. Harris's two di&s;cour&s;es upon it, intitled, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of believing in Chri&s;t, and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of infidelity, with the appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P>I might alledge under this head, and for confirm|ation of the point I am upon, that the writers of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory relate many miracles, which a multi|tude of per&s;ons were the &s;ubjects of. For in&s;tance, the de&s;cending of the Holy Gho&s;t, and their &s;peaking with tongues. Thus Peter tells his hearers, that if they repented, and were bapti&s;ed, they &s;hould receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. And we are informed, that while Peter &s;pake to the people <HI>the
<PB N="118" REF="028262_0121_0FD7F4FD9B01B628">Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them that heard the word.</HI> Now this was a &s;en&s;ible thing; the per&s;ons that received the gift could no more doubt of it than of the mo&s;t obvious, plain and certain truths: they could not be deceived in the matter, could not but know whether they &s;pake with tongues they had never learned, and whether they wrought miracles or no. The thing was evident to others, and therefore Si|mon Magus de&s;ired that he might have power granted him <HI>that on whom&s;oever he &s;hould lay hands he might receive the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Others &s;aw it, the per&s;ons them&s;elves felt it, and it was impo&s;&s;ible that herein they &s;hould be deceived.</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;trengthens the argument and further &s;hews the impo&s;&s;ibility of an impo&s;ture, that a multitude of per&s;ons, and of all &s;orts of per&s;ons, received and believed the go&s;pel hi&s;tory; the Jews, the Gen|tiles, many thou&s;ands and myriads of the&s;e; &s;uch as had been avowed enemies, owned their convic|tion and became converts, and that again&s;t the mo&s;t inveterate prejudices. Thus we are told, that <HI>the word of God increa&s;ed, and the number of the di&s;ciples multiplied in Jeru&s;alem, and a greal number of the prie&s;ts were obedient to the faith.</HI> Among the re&s;t, let me only mention the ca&s;e of the apo&s;tle Paul. It is known how deeply he was engaged in another intere&s;t, in oppo&s;ing Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel. He was a per&s;on of character and eminency in the Jewi&s;h church, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, bred up under the famous Gamaliel, entered into the &s;ect of the Phari&s;ees, and exceeding <HI>zealous for the traditions of the elders,</HI> as the re&s;t of that faction were. Here|upon the name of Chri&s;t became odious to him, as a per&s;on that not only le&s;&s;ened the authority of Mo&s;es, but had declared him&s;elf an enemy to the traditions and inventions of the Phari&s;ees, con|demning them as the gro&s;&s;e&s;t hypocrites, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> religion as vain and worthle&s;s. This inflamed him
<PB N="119" REF="028262_0122_0FD7F4FFB62DD3C8">again&s;t chri&s;tianity; and you know how much he &s;et him&s;elf to run it down. He was pre&s;ent at the death of Stephen, the fir&s;t martyr, and was an en|courager of it, received a commi&s;&s;ion from the chief prie&s;ts to do the honorable work of a per&s;ecutor, which he followed with a zeal, that he him&s;elf after|wards called madne&s;s, haling men and women to pri&s;on, and breathing nothing but threatnings and &s;laughter, and death again&s;t them. Now, I would demand of any rea&s;onable man, whether it was like|ly, nay, whether it was po&s;&s;ible, on &s;uppo&s;ition, that the facts in the go&s;pel had been a forgery to per|&s;uade this per&s;on and others to have received them. They could not believe the go&s;pel without quit|ting the mo&s;t &s;tubborn prejudices which had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their minds; without quitting their hon|ors, their intere&s;ts, and preferments; without con|tradicting and condemning them&s;elves, and expo&s;|ing them&s;elves to all manner of reproach and &s;uf|ferings. And would per&s;ons in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces be gulled and cheated by a company of poor fi&s;hermen, and contemptible Gallileans? he that can believe this, is prepared to believe any thing; and indeed believes the mo&s;t ab&s;urd, incredible thing in the world, even whil&s;t he pretends to re|ject the go&s;pel for want of credibility.</P>
<P>So that I do not think I talk in too high a &s;train, when I &s;ay, that it is impo&s;&s;ible the go&s;pel hi&s;tory &s;hould be fal&s;e; and particularly, that if the writers of it had a mind to deceive, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have been able to do it. I may add to what has been &s;aid,</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is not po&s;&s;ible the go&s;pel hi&s;tory, had it been fal&s;e, &s;hould have maintained its credit in the world to this day. Not to repeat here, what has been ob&s;erved already, that it was embraced by &s;o many again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and prejudices, has been examined by &s;uch multitudes
<PB N="120" REF="028262_0123_0FD7F5032C530008">of per&s;ons of different opinions and intere&s;ts. What I would at pre&s;ent remark is, that God him|&s;elf would not have &s;uffered &s;uch an impo&s;ture to have been palmed and impo&s;ed upon the world. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with the divine knowledge, mer|cy and goodne&s;s, to have &s;uffered in his providence a book &s;o full of the &s;tronge&s;t evidence to be of|fered to mankind, a book that looks &s;o like true, that it is impo&s;&s;ible by any faculties we have, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from true, had it been really fal&s;e. He would not have &s;uffered his creatures, e&s;peci|ally the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of them, and I cannot for|bear accounting them &s;uch that have &s;hewn the greate&s;t veneration for chri&s;tianity and the Bible, to be thus tried, and to have lain under a delu&s;ion from age to age.</P>
<P>I grant there are many impo&s;tures and cheats in the world; but God is true, wi&s;e and good, the be&s;t as well as greate&s;t of beings, and he will not neglect, or be wanting, to his upright &s;ervants that &s;incerely de&s;ire to be taught by him, and be &s;ubject to him in all things. In a word, &s;hould we be deceived here, I cannot &s;ee but we are deceived by an evidence that is in a great mea&s;ure irre&s;i&s;table. We cannot reject it without denying our faculties, going con|trary to the faculties God has given us, or if I may be allowed to &s;ay &s;o, governing our&s;elves by other faculties than he has given us. And con&s;equently, to &s;uppo&s;e the Bible may be fal&s;e, is to &s;uppo&s;e that our very faculties en&s;nare, and that God has left us to be deceived in the proper u&s;e of them, without ever interpo&s;ing for our relief; which is an horrid arraigning the author of our nature, and i&s;&s;ues in no le&s;s a bla&s;phemy than this, that if we be deceived, God has deceived us.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;ufficiently proved that the &s;crip|ture is true, that it has all the characters of truth that any other ancient hi&s;tory has, and that if we
<PB N="121" REF="028262_0124_0FD7F5046627D280">are not to receive it, we can believe no hi&s;tory in the world; I have proved it has greater evidence of truth in it, and that all things con&s;idered, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be true.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may be ready to &s;ay, to what pur|po&s;e is all this wa&s;te? we do not que&s;tion the truth of the Bible. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is good to be provided again&s;t the day of trial. You do not know what temptations you may meet with on this head; the time may come when you may want your faith a&s;&s;i&s;ted and confirmed, and then &s;uch arguments will be of u&s;e to you, if you have dige&s;ted them and made them your own, what|ever you think of them now: and even though you could not recollect many of them, it will be of advantage at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, that this point has been cleared up to you to the &s;atisfaction of your minds; and that you have &s;een the evidence of this great point, and have made a judgement concerning it. This may help to repel a temptation to infidelity, when you are not, it may be, able at pre&s;ent to an|&s;wer every cavil and &s;ugge&s;tion. As a per&s;on may be very ea&s;y, and re&s;t &s;atisfied in his title to his e&s;|tate, after it has been examined, though he &s;hould have forgot the particulars of his &s;ecurity, and even the very names of the witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. You &s;ay, you believe the Bible, but it may be you only take it for granted without believing, or knowing wherefore you believe it. If this be your ca&s;e, as I am afraid it is too commonly the ca&s;e of profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians; your faith has nothing rational or divine in it; it &s;tands upon no better founda|tion than the faith of the mahometan with re&s;pect to the Alcoran. The Bible has been delivered to you, as a divine book, and accordingly you receive it without examining, which is not truly believing, and only &s;hews you are chri&s;tians by accident, and that your religion comes to you as many mens
<PB N="122" REF="028262_0125_0FD7F505D3D61830">e&s;tates do, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and inheritance from their fathers. I add,</P>
<P N="3">3. The fuller evidence we have for our faith, the more effectual it is like to be, the more it will in|fluence the heart and command the life. Did we believe the Bible more firmly upon &s;olid grounds and clear conviction of its truth, diligently con|ver&s;ing with tho&s;e arguments by which the autho|rity of it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, its doctrines would have greater force upon us, and be embraced with more affection, we &s;hould mind it more, &s;tudy it more, live it better.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE V. THE DIVINE ORIGINAL AND INSPIRATION OF THE SCRIPTURE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;ubject I am upon, is the divine autho|rity of the Scriptures, my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s be|ing to demon&s;trate and prove the &s;ame. And the &s;cheme I propo&s;ed to pur&s;ue for this purpo&s;e, was,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To &s;hew that the Bible is true, or that the facts there related are &s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That it is in&s;pired. And.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That the books of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment, are the originally in&s;pired books of the Bible.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I have hitherto in&s;i&s;ted upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars, and have proved, I hope, to &s;atisfac|tion,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient hi&s;tory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it hath greater marks of credibility. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That circum&s;tances con&s;i|dered, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be true.</ITEM>
</LIST>
I do not intend that it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible. What is naturally impo&s;&s;ible, cannot be otherwi&s;e without a contradiction in the very nature of things. Thus it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame thing &s;hould be, and not be, at the &s;ame time; &s;hould be true and fal&s;e at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e.
<PB N="124" REF="028262_0127_0FD7F50DB2EEECD8">And thus I grant, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the hi&s;|tory of the Bible may be fal&s;e. For in&s;tance, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the writers of it might be deceiv|ed them&s;elves. They might lo&s;e the u&s;e of their &s;en&s;es and faculties; their imagination might be di&s;turbed, and the texture of their brain altered. It is not naturally impo&s;&s;ible but they might, not|with&s;tanding their fair appearances of integrity, be at the bottom gro&s;s cheats. A man may be deceived him&s;elf, and he may deceive others; he may be weak and deluded, he may be a knave and intend to delude and cheat. This is true of every man in the world, for all mens faculties are finite and boun|ded, weak and defective. It is a contradiction and naturally impo&s;&s;ible that God, a being of infinite perfection, &s;hould either be deceived or deceive, but it is not &s;o with re&s;pect to man, the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men. It is not naturally impo&s;&s;ible that men may mi&s;take their intere&s;ts, may invent and imbelli&s;h an unprofitable lie, that they may run upon their own de&s;truction for no advantage; a frenzy may &s;eize them, or a fal&s;e appearance of things may carry them on without &s;u&s;picion of the tragical i&s;&s;ue. All this, and a great deal more that might be &s;uppo&s;ed, is not naturally impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding, it mu&s;t be a&s;&s;erted, that there are ca&s;es, and the ca&s;e before us is of that nature, in which we have &s;uch evidence of the truth and certainty of facts, and of the per&s;ons te&s;|timony, on which we believe the facts, that it is morally impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be deceived. This is too ab&s;tru&s;e and nice a &s;peculation, or I dur&s;t un|dertake the proof and even demon&s;tration of it, that it is morally impo&s;&s;ible, that the writers of the Bible have impo&s;ed a fal&s;e hi&s;tory upon us, and that the Bible &s;hould be fal&s;e. I beg leave only to retouch what I have already enlarged upon, which I think makes good this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="028262_0128_0FD7F50EDD538D98">
It is morally impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o many per&s;ons &s;hould be deceived them&s;elves, in &s;o many &s;uch in|&s;tances and in the &s;everal facts related by them; that Mo&s;es, the evangeli&s;ts, and apo&s;tles &s;hould be deceived. The rea&s;on is, they have all the evi|dence that men are capable of having: had the a&s;&s;urance and clo&s;e&s;t te&s;timony of all their &s;en&s;es. And con&s;equently, if they were deceived all other men may be deceived in all other in&s;tances, and there is no certainty of any thing remaining. And if this be granted, there is an end of all conver&s;e and of all religion: we can neither have corre&s;|pondence with our follow creatures, nor receive any revelation from God. For how do I know what any man &s;aith to me, or that he &s;peaks at all; that God &s;peaks, or what he &s;peaks, if I may not tru&s;t my &s;en&s;es and faculties. And if Mo&s;es or the apo&s;tles might not tru&s;t their &s;en&s;es, but might be deceived in the report they make of the miracles and facts that fell under their ob&s;ervation, you and I, and all the world, may be deceived, and that in every thing. The re&s;ult of which is, that we can depend neither on God, our neighbor, nor our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o morally impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould deceive others, or de&s;ign an attempt to do it. One rea&s;on of this may be taken from the con&s;equence of de|nying the &s;incerity of the&s;e per&s;ons. It is certain that man was made for &s;ociety, with an inclination and love to it: he needs it, de&s;ires it, derives his &s;upport and comfort from it. And as God de&s;igned him for &s;uch a &s;tate, he has given him principles, or made impre&s;&s;ions upon him, &s;uitable thereto. It is al&s;o certain that there can be no &s;ociety without mutual tru&s;t and confidence, which is the band and cement of it; nor any mutual tru&s;t without truth and integrity &s;uppo&s;ed, which is the foundation on which it re&s;ts. Now what I a&s;&s;ert and argue from is this, that the per&s;ons I am &s;peaking of, the wri|ters
<PB N="126" REF="028262_0129_0FD7F5106BAAD928">of the Scripture, had the highe&s;t characters of integrity. If we do not admit them to be credible, none are, none ever were, or can be credible. The con&s;equence of which, if it be con&s;idered will be no le&s;s than the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety. Where there is no truth there can be no tru&s;t, and where there is no tru&s;t there can be no &s;ociety. And if we may not tru&s;t &s;uch men, appearing with &s;uch criterions and marks of hone&s;ty as Mo&s;es and the apo&s;tles, we can tru&s;t none in the world.</P>
<P>Further, they could have no motive to deceive, which is another rea&s;on of my a&s;&s;ertion, and &s;hews it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould intend to do it. Men do not u&s;e to invent lies for nothing; much le&s;s to &s;pend their time, &s;acrifice their ea&s;e, reputation, in|tere&s;t, and even their lives, in propagating an un|profitable forgery, and what they know to be a for|gery. And yet this was the ca&s;e of the writers of the Bible, of the New Te&s;tament preachers and writers particularly, if their hi&s;tory be fal&s;e. The facts they publi&s;hed to the world, and the doctrines they preached, were &s;uch as brought all &s;orts of &s;ufferings upon them. They were told and ex|pected it would be &s;o; and yet &s;tedfa&s;tly, re&s;olutely and unanimou&s;ly, give their te&s;timony, and adhere to it to the la&s;t, &s;ealing it with their blood. Now I reckon it morally impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have acted &s;uch a part, had they been con&s;cious of im|po&s;ture, and known they were deceiving the world. It is contrary to the human nature, to the princi|ples of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and to that &s;elf-love that is natural to every man: for though the will chu&s;e freely and cannot be forced, yet no man can chu&s;e evil as &s;uch, chu&s;e mi&s;ery, &s;ufferings, and de&s;truc|tion. So that we have the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity here that the&s;e per&s;ons were no deceivers, that the Bible is true, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention one thing more, <HI>viz.</HI> that it
<PB N="127" REF="028262_0130_0FD7F51402F7EEF8">is morally impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o many per&s;ons of different &s;entiments in other things, different intere&s;ts and parties, &s;hould agree in contriving an impo&s;ture, and &s;o many others &s;till of different intere&s;ts, and the like, &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon by it, and none of the former ever confe&s;s, nor any of the latter ever de|tect the impo&s;ture. This I affirm impo&s;&s;ible. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e mankind to have faculties and natures very different from what they now have, and to be governed by different laws, before we can admit &s;uch a ca&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. There is no &s;ufficient cau&s;e of &s;uch an effect; but on the other hand, there are cau&s;es, known, certain, and con&s;tant, proceeding from nature, and the governing principles of man|kind, that would produce a contrary effect. It is not po&s;&s;ible that among the many thou&s;ands that owned chri&s;tianity, &s;ome e&s;pecially when they came to &s;uf|ferings and death, &s;hould not have acknowledged the villainy, had there been any. Surely &s;ome of them would have done it, to have delivered their con&s;ciences from reproach, or at lea&s;t to have &s;aved their lives. It is not po&s;&s;ible, had their &s;tory been fal&s;e, that their enemies, who were &s;pectators and witne&s;&s;es of the facts they report, and to whom they appeal, &s;hould be &s;ilent, and never contradict or undertake to di&s;prove them: but in&s;tead of it, mul|titudes of them be wrought upon to e&s;pou&s;e the &s;ame cau&s;e, and confirm it with their te&s;timony and blood. Lay &s;uch a &s;cheme nearer home and among our&s;elves, and it will be ea&s;y to &s;ee, that a forgery is impo&s;&s;ible in any ca&s;e that bears a tolerable re|&s;emblance to that we are con&s;idering.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not dwell any longer upon the&s;e things, having con&s;idered the matter more fully before; and only de&s;igning by this review a little more particu|larly to limit, explain, and confirm the la&s;t propo|&s;ition I advanced, <HI>viz.</HI> that circum&s;tances con&s;ider|ed, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible the Bible &s;hould not be
<PB N="128" REF="028262_0131_0FD7F5181E889EB0">true. Taking it therefore for granted, as a point I have already, I think, &s;ufficiently proved; that it is true: I now proceed a &s;tep further, to the next thing propo&s;ed, which was,</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove, that the Bible is the word of God, or, that the books which compo&s;e our &s;criptures were given by divine in&s;piration. I have enlarged upon the foregoing head, the truth of the &s;acred hi&s;|tory, beyond my fir&s;t intention, and indeed had I de&s;igned to have taken &s;uch a compa&s;s, I &s;hould have ca&s;t part of my di&s;cour&s;e into a different me|thod. I &s;hall endeavor to be &s;horter on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, namely, in confirming the in&s;piration of the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>What I mean when I &s;ay, the penmen thereof were in&s;pired, is that they wrote under the &s;pecial and infallible conduct of the Holy Spirit; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the prophets and apo&s;tles, they that were concerned in delivering to us the truths and doctrines of the Bi|ble, were &s;ont of God and commi&s;&s;ioned by him, were &s;tirred up to their re&s;pective undertakings and &s;ervices by God, by whom they were al&s;o infallibly affi&s;ted, &s;o as, that the things they deliver mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a revelation from him.</P>
<P>There were indeed different modes of revelation, and different kinds and degrees of in&s;piration: as I ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e from this text. <HI>God at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, &s;pake unto the fathers by the prophets.</HI> Sometimes he re|vealed him&s;elf to them by dreams, &s;ometimes by vi&s;ions; &s;ometimes by a voice, an audible voice, thus he &s;pake to Adam, Abraham, Mo&s;es, and others: and &s;ometimes by inward impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind or under&s;tanding, which is more properly in&s;piration.</P>
<P>Sometimes he &s;ugge&s;ted the very matter and words to them. Sometimes, I &s;uppo&s;e, he left them to the u&s;e of their own words, &s;upplying them with
<PB N="129" REF="028262_0132_0FD7F525F05955A8">the matter; and in things they were well acquaint|ed with, and recorded as hi&s;tory, and of which they had been eye-witne&s;&s;es, all that I think nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ert is, that he concurred with them and a&s;&s;i&s;ted as there was occa&s;ion, and &s;o as might &s;ecure them from mi&s;take: ju&s;t as a guide to a traveller, he needs not direct him in that part of the way he him|&s;elf knows, it is enough to attend him, and when he is like to wander, to admoni&s;h, or reduce when he doth wander. In a word, by the in&s;piration of the Bible is meant, that it is a divine revelation, a reve|lation from God. The hi&s;tory of it is infallibly true, and immediately in&s;pired &s;o far as was nece&s;&s;a|ry; the doctrines of it communicated from heaven, in various ways and different manners, I grant; but all from heaven; publi&s;hed by per&s;ons that had a divine commi&s;&s;ion, who were &s;ent of God to make &s;uch revelations to the world. The further clear|ing and &s;tating this point, I am &s;en&s;ible, would re|quire a great deal of time; but as &s;omething was &s;aid of it before, though very &s;hort and defective, I &s;hall not re&s;ume it, but directly go on to prove what I am upon, namely, that the Bible is the word of God, or that the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, are divinely in&s;pired. To which pur|po&s;e, I &s;hall lay before you &s;everal arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. The writers of the Bible profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be in&s;pired, to be &s;ent of God, and accordingly &s;peak in his name. We have many general a&s;&s;er|tions with reference to this; as in the text, <HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> So, 2 Pet. i. 20.21. <HI>No prophecy of Scripture is of private in|terpretation. For the prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> It is not of private interpretation, or rather private &s;ugge&s;tion or im|pul&s;e, for &s;o the word <HI>Epilu&s;is</HI> may &s;ignify, though &s;ome crities think that the text &s;hould be read dif|ferently,
<PB N="130" REF="028262_0133_0FD7F528AC5B29E0">and that <HI>Epilu&s;is,</HI> is put for <HI>Epelu&s;is,</HI> thus Calvin, Grotius, and others, which notes an afflatus or conception within: &s;o that what the apo&s;tle in|tends is, that the prophecy of Scripture, or the writ|ten word, was not the product of mens own fancies and conceptions; but was by a divine afflatus, that is, it was given by in&s;piration of God. And indeed, whether we have recour&s;e to this critici&s;m or not, and change the reading, for which the authority of &s;ome copies is pleaded, the apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning in the words that immediately follow makes this &s;en&s;e plain, and I think nece&s;&s;ary; <HI>For,</HI> he adds, <HI>prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> If by private interpretation we mean the expound|ing of Scripture by particular per&s;ons, and every one for him&s;elf, as if that was denied here, to which purpo&s;e the papi&s;ts apply the words, though they have nothing in them favorable to their cau&s;e, ex|cept the &s;ound, and build upon them a nece&s;&s;ity of a public authoritative interpreter; if we under|&s;tand the text thus, I &s;ay, there is no force in what the apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins. But if we take <HI>Epilu&s;is</HI> for in&s;piration, as I think we are con&s;trained to do, what follows in <HI>ver.</HI> 21 is a confirmation of that which is &s;aid in the 20th. No prophecy is by pri|vate impul&s;e, for <HI>it came not by the will of man,</HI> it was not the i&s;&s;ue of their own faculties and rea&s;on|ing, was not from any motion or choice of their own, they did not go upon their &s;everal errands, and deliver &s;uch and &s;uch me&s;&s;ages to the world from their own heads; but had a divine impul&s;e, <HI>&s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> This I take to be the &s;en&s;e of that text: and &s;o you &s;ee it is a full te&s;timony to the truth I am upon, that the writers of the Scripture were in&s;pired.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing we have el&s;ewhere and often a&s;|&s;erted, as <HI>Acts</HI> iii. 21. <HI>God &s;pake by the mouth of all
<PB N="131" REF="028262_0134_0FD7F528AE7FCB18">his holy prophets &s;ince the world began.</HI> Acts i. 16. <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;pake by the mouth of David.</HI> And again, <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 25. <HI>Who by the mouth of thy &s;ervant David hath &s;aid, why did the heathen rage!</HI> &amp;c. re|ferring to the &s;econd P&s;alm. The prophets were God's me&s;&s;engers, his in&s;truments; he &s;pake by them, by <HI>all of them &s;ince the world began.</HI> And we have the &s;ame account given of the apo&s;tles. Hence they are mentioned jointly with the prophets, as the foundation on which we are built. And Chri&s;t &s;ays to them, <HI>It is not ye that &s;peak, but the &s;pirit of your Father, that &s;peaketh in you.</HI></P>
<P>I may add, that they all profe&s;s, for them&s;elves, to be &s;ent from God, to &s;peak from him, and to deliver his doctrine and me&s;&s;age. Mo&s;es gives an account of his commi&s;&s;ion, of his being &s;ent imme|diately by God, with the circum&s;tances thereof; he tells how God appeared to him in a burning bu&s;h, as he was keeping Jethro's flock, and gave him orders to go to Pharaoh and undertake the deliverance of oppre&s;&s;ed I&s;rael. And you know when he afterwards came to deliver laws to that people, he always introduces God as the author of them; thus you read, the <HI>Lord &s;pake unto him out of the tabernacle,</HI> and appointed the laws and &s;ervices following. And, <HI>God &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying, &s;peak unto the children of I&s;rael,</HI> which is con&s;tantly re|peated when any new matter was to be laid before them. Nor did the following prophets of the Old Te&s;tament pretend to act without the like authority, the word of the Lord came to them when they pro|phe&s;ied, <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> was the common pre|face to their me&s;&s;ages and di&s;cour&s;es. The &s;ame might be ob&s;erved concerning them that delivered the doctrine of the New Te&s;tament. Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the great prophet of the church, owns his commi&s;|&s;ion from the Father, and that he received his doc|trine
<PB N="132" REF="028262_0135_0FD7F52A0B007F70">from him, <HI>my doctrine,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is not mine, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his that &s;ent me.</HI> Again, <HI>he that &s;ent me is true, and I &s;peak unto the world tho&s;e things which I have heard of him.</HI> And, <HI>I do nothing of my&s;elf, but as the fa|ther has taught me, I &s;peak the&s;e things.</HI> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>I have not &s;poken of my&s;elf, but the Father which &s;ent me, he gave me commandment what I &s;hould &s;ay, and what I &s;hould &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tles claimed the like authority; I do not mean, equal to Chri&s;t, but a divine mi&s;&s;ion and au|thority, as he did; hence when they proceed to the determination of the que&s;tion debated in the council at Jeru&s;alem, they intere&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t therein, <HI>it &s;eems good to the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and lo us,</HI> intimating, that what they delivered to the churches the Holy Gho&s;t delivered; or more pro|perly delivered it by and under his immediate con|duct and direction. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t copious writer of the New Te&s;tament, was the apo&s;tle Paul, and we find him on all occa&s;ions a&s;&s;erting his divine authority and in&s;piration. He tells the <HI>Corinthians</HI> that he had <HI>received of the Lord, what he delivered to them.</HI> That the <HI>things he wrote were the command|ments of God.</HI> And to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> that he was <HI>an apo&s;tle not of men, neither by man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father.</HI> And how direct that to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians, when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God.</HI> And St. Peter, &s;peaking of the go&s;pel, &s;ays, <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent it down from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>This is what the writers of the Scripture profe&s;s; many of them in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, and you have heard the &s;ame is affirmed of all of them. If it be objected, that impo&s;tors have profe&s;&s;ed the like; many have pretended to in&s;piration, that were deluded by their own fancies, or by a warm and heated imagination, and how do we know that
<PB N="133" REF="028262_0136_0FD7F52CAB3B13E0">the writers of the Bible were not impo&s;ed upon as well as others. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is granted, &s;ome have been deluded, and have taken their own imaginations for a divine re|velation; but this is no argument that all are &s;o; and that none ever had a revelation from God. A man may fancy him&s;elf awake when he is in a dream, and have a great many &s;cenes laid before him in his &s;leep, which he takes for real, though all be imaginary. But it doth not follow from hence, that he cannot know when he is awake, or be cer|tain that ever he is awake, or of any thing that is tran&s;acted before him, or that he him&s;elf doth when he is awake. No more doth it follow that becau&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tempered brains have thought them&s;elves in&s;pired, when they were not, that none could ever know that they were in&s;pired.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would a&s;k the objectors here, whether they will allow that God is able to reveal him&s;elf to any part of mankind, &s;o that they &s;hall be certain of the revelation? If not, they &s;uppo&s;e God has le&s;s power and &s;kill than men have, who can expre&s;s their minds to their fellow-creatures in &s;uch a manner, as that they are &s;ure who it is that &s;peaks to them, and what it is they &s;peak. And if God is able to do this, the objection falls to the ground. Some per&s;ons may then have a revelation from him, any may, to whom he plea&s;es to vouch&s;afe it, in which they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured there is no impo&s;ture or de|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The per&s;ons in&s;pired might know by inward &s;en&s;ation and feeling, that they were in&s;pired, and that God &s;pake to them; and I doubt not, with as an infallible a certainty as we know when another per&s;on, like our&s;elves, is conver&s;ing with us, and &s;peaking to us. God might make &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion upon their &s;en&s;es and minds as carried its own evidence with it, and though we that are utterly
<PB N="134" REF="028262_0137_0FD7F52E04C9D480">&s;trangers to &s;uch a communication with God, have no idea or notion of it, they that were concerned could feel it, and knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h it. To clear this in all the in&s;tances of in&s;piration, by voices, dreams, vi&s;ions, and more direct and mental in&s;piration, as I may call it, would require a long di&s;cour&s;e of it&s;elf, which I know you will excu&s;e me from, though a &s;ubject well worthy our &s;erious thoughts, was this a place for it. I will only &s;ay, if we allow God is able to make any revelation of him&s;elf, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he can do it in a way that is di&s;tinct and certain: and I need not &s;cruple to add, that the per&s;on to whom he makes it, may di&s;|cern it by the faculties to which he applies in his revelation, as clearly as we do our mutual di&s;courie, the communication we have one with another.</P>
<P N="4">4. There was nothing that looks like delu&s;ion in the ca&s;e of the&s;e &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red writers and preachers. They had all the marks of a regular head and of a calm &s;edate mind, that can be; had none of the heats of enthu&s;ia&s;ts &s;o far as appears. And particu|larly they were not credulous, did not &s;eem for|ward to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they engaged in; nor to have any preparation and bent towards the &s;ervice they undertook. You know what objections Mo&s;es made again&s;t the errand God called him to, <HI>who am I,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that I &s;hould go unto Pharaoh, and that I &s;hould bring forth the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt? They will not believe me nor hearken to my voice.</HI> And after God had conde&s;cended to give him &s;a|tisfaction in this matter, &s;till he objects, <HI>O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor &s;ince thou ha&s;t &s;poken unto thy fervant.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding God had promi&s;ed to be with him and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, his reluctancy &s;till remains. <HI>O my Lord, &s;end I pray th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e by the hand of him whom thou wilt &s;end.</HI> So little was this per&s;on prepared to be played upon
<PB N="135" REF="028262_0138_0FD7F5310FC6BA10">and abu&s;ed, either by his own imagination or the management of others.</P>
<P>And the like might be ob&s;erved of the apo&s;tles. They were them&s;elves very much prejudiced again&s;t the main articles of the doctrines that they were to teach the world, <HI>viz.</HI> the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. Though their ma&s;ter had often &s;poke thereof to them they could not believe it, nor did they under&s;tand him: &s;o far from it, that when it came to pa&s;s and he was actually put to death, their hopes &s;eemed to die with him, <HI>we tru&s;ted,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>that it had been he which &s;hould have redeemed I&s;rael.</HI> Words of de&s;pair, intimating they thought their cau&s;e lo&s;t and ruined. So when they were told of his re&s;urrection, it is &s;aid, <HI>the words &s;eemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</HI> This was the ca&s;e of the apo&s;tles at that time. The apo&s;tle Paul was not then of their number, but afterwards called to the &s;ame office, and had an eminent part in pub|li&s;hing the doctrine of the New Te&s;tament, and I need not tell you that he had even &s;tronger preju|dices than the re&s;t again&s;t the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;ed. He per&s;ecuted Chri&s;t in his members with the ut|mo&s;t fury; and &s;o much had his zeal blinded him, that as he owns in his defence before Agrippa, he <HI>verily thought with him&s;elf he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Je&s;us of Nazareth.</HI> In which temper of mind divine grace, and the call of God &s;ound him. Now how little there is in all this of the characters of enthu&s;ia&s;in, how oppo&s;ite and con|trary it is thereto, every one may ea&s;ily di&s;cern. Enthu&s;ia&s;ts generally have a preparation in the bent and temper of their mind, to receive the de|lu&s;ion; they readily believe that to be true, which they would have to be true: they are prejudiced in favor of their pretended revelation. Whereas, the prejudices of the&s;e per&s;ons lay the other way, and were &s;o &s;trong that it is plain they would not
<PB N="136" REF="028262_0139_0FD7F5329C3EA2F8">act without full conviction of the call of God, and till they were overpowered, as I may &s;ay, into the belief of it. I add,</P>
<P N="5">5 That no &s;cruples might remain God gave them &s;uch evidence of his &s;peaking to them and of their mi&s;&s;ion as could not be re&s;i&s;ted. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that when God &s;pake to Mo&s;es in Horeb out of the burning bu&s;h, he might doubt whether it was real or not, whether he was in a dream or trance, whether it was not &s;ome unaccountable phoenomenon that had nothing of divinity in it, or the artifice of an evil &s;pirit. Suppo&s;e this I &s;ay, he could not doubt any longer when God bid him ca&s;t his rod upon the ground and it became a &s;erpent. Much le&s;s could he carry his &s;cruple with him in all his journey from Horeb to Egypt, and &s;till maintain it after all that pa&s;&s;ed in Egypt; after he had by the power of God wrought &s;o many miracles there, in the pre|&s;ence of Pharaoh and of the I&s;raelites. He that can &s;uppo&s;e this is too great a &s;ceptic to be rea&s;on|ed with; and indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould, upon his principles, be certain of the reality of any thing that he &s;ees or hears, or that he him&s;elf doth. God reveals him&s;elf to Mo&s;es, that is the thing I am a&s;|&s;erting, and that he might be &s;ure of the revelation, he fir&s;t &s;ummons and awakens his attention by a &s;trange appearance, a bu&s;h all in a flame and not con&s;umed. Then he &s;peaks to him out of the bu&s;h in a manner that no que&s;tion, had &s;omething great and maje&s;tic in it, and brought along with it evi|dence of divinity. And that Mo&s;es might be able to &s;atisfy others, and at the &s;ame time be further &s;atisfied him&s;elf, for what would do the one, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to do the other, he enables him to work a miracle, and afterwards repeat that, and do many more miracles. All which con&s;idered, I think it even impo&s;&s;ible that Mo&s;es &s;hould be deceived; and if any are &s;o re&s;olute, as to &s;uppo&s;e he might
<PB N="137" REF="028262_0140_0FD7F533625D12C8">be under a delu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding all this &s;ecu|rity to the contrary, they mu&s;t be forced to &s;ay that God cannot reveal him&s;elf to mankind with certainty, or mankind is not capable of receiving the revelation, which comes to the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>I might illu&s;trate the argument in many more in&s;tances, particularly in that of the apo&s;tles. But I will only ob&s;erve, that when they were fir&s;t called to their office they labored under a great many in|abilities, wanted light, wi&s;dom, courage; and were no way equal to &s;o difficult a work as lay before them, <HI>viz.</HI> preaching the go&s;pel to and pro&s;elyting all nations. This they were but meanly qualified for, and therefore their great ma&s;ter, when he took leave of them ju&s;t before his a&s;cen&s;ion, bid them tarry at <HI>Jeru&s;ale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> until they were indued with power from on high.</HI> What this power was we are told, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 8. <HI>Ye &s;hall receive power after that the Holy Gho&s;t is come upon you: and ye &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es unto me, both in Jeru&s;alem, and in all Judea, and in Sa|maria, and unto the uttermo&s;t part of the earth.</HI> This he promi&s;ed, and in the &s;econd of Acts you have an hi&s;tory of the great event, an account of the ac|compli&s;hment of the promi&s;e, when the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon them at the day of Penteco&s;t. The con|&s;equence of which was their &s;peaking all &s;orts of tongues which they had never learned, to the amazement of tho&s;e that heard them, <HI>ver.</HI> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Now as this was the power from on high, their ma&s;ter had given them rea&s;on to expect, and an eminent in&s;tance of their in&s;piration; &s;o it was a &s;en&s;ible thing and carried its own evidence along with it; they found that change in them&s;elves, that exaltation of their faculties, that new light in their minds, and that new furniture of &s;trength and abi|lity communicated to them, that they could no more que&s;tion the thing, nor that it was from God, than that they could que&s;tion their own beings, and
<PB N="138" REF="028262_0141_0FD7F53C4D15AF88">whether they were men or not. If their &s;en&s;es and faculties might deceive them in this particular, they might deceive them in all other things; and I think I may add, all other men in all other in&s;tances may be deceived; and con&s;equently it will be true, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, we are, and can be, certain of nothing.</P>
<P>So that thus far, I would hope the way is toler|ably clear. The writers of Scripture affirm them|&s;elves to be in&s;pired; and they could not be under a delu&s;ion, but might know whether they were in|&s;pired or not.</P>
<P>But it may here again be a&s;ked, how doth this prove the point I bring it for, namely, that they were in&s;pired? they might impo&s;e upon us, and take upon them to be in&s;pired, to be &s;ent of God, and to be entru&s;ted with a revelation from heaven, when they were not. We have only their bare word for it. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. All the arguments I before produced, to prove their hi&s;tory true, will conclude in their behalf in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I have given you &s;ufficient evi|dence that there were &s;uch per&s;ons, that they did the things they relate, that the matters of fact they record were genuine, that they had all the charac|ters of ingenuity, integrity, and veracity, that any hi&s;torians ever had, or can have, and that if we can|not believe them, and depend on their te&s;timony, it follows, none in the world are to be believed in any of their reports; that there is no &s;uch thing as credible hi&s;tory, and as was further argued in a former di&s;cour&s;e, no &s;afe conver&s;e; all mutual tru&s;t and conver&s;e is de&s;troyed; and in a word, human &s;ociety mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved. This it was proved, would be the con&s;equence of denying the credit and refu&s;ing the te&s;timony of per&s;ons &s;o qualified, as the writers of the Bible were. And, I think, it needs no proof, that if we cannot believe them in this part
<PB N="139" REF="028262_0142_0FD7F5412F55DBE0">of their te&s;timony concerning their in&s;piration and divine mi&s;&s;ion, we may believe them in nothing. So that the re&s;ult is this, if there be any &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es among mankind, the&s;e were &s;uch; if any true hi&s;tory, the Bible is true, and if the Bible be true it was in&s;pired.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;uppo&s;e them guilty of forgery, and to pretend to a commi&s;&s;ion and revelation from God, when they knew they had none, is to make them act contrary to all the principles of human nature that we are acquainted with. It makes them guilty, not only of an unprofitable, but of a de&s;tructive lie. They knew, according to the rules of the religion they propagated, they could have no reward in ano|ther world; and they knew as certainly they mu&s;t be undone in this world. And what &s;ort of crea|tures mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e them, if we make them act &s;o extravagant a part, expo&s;ing them&s;elves as they did without any motive. For in&s;tance, what temptation could Mo&s;es have to forego the honors and prefer|ment in Pharaoh's court, and chu&s;e to &s;uffer af|fliction with the people of God, had he not been a&s;&s;ured of a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e call? What could induce the apo&s;tles to follow Chri&s;t through &s;ufferings, per&s;e|cution and death, had they been con&s;cious of a lie, que&s;tioned the authority of their ma&s;ter, or their own &s;incerity, in engaging in his &s;ervice? Would the apo&s;tle Paul, think you, have renounced the commi&s;&s;ion he had from the great men of the Jew|i&s;h church, with all the advantages he expected from them, and become a preacher of Chri&s;t, upon no other pro&s;pect but bonds, impri&s;onment, and mar|tyrdom? Would he have done this, had he not been a&s;&s;ured of the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;ed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the certainty of the heavenly vi&s;ion, as he calls it? So that we have not only an argument taken from their veracity, but a &s;trong evidence
<PB N="140" REF="028262_0143_0FD7F5419DA32C68">ari&s;ing out of the principles of the human nature. To &s;uppo&s;e they were deceivers in this in&s;tance, is to &s;uppo&s;e them ruining them&s;elves for nothing, guilty of the greate&s;t wickedne&s;s without any rea|&s;on, and doing evil for evil's-&s;ake; which it may be is more than can be charged on the devil him|&s;elf. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. They not only &s;aid they were in&s;pired, but proved it by a train of facts that alarmed and amazed them. God gave &s;atisfaction to Mo&s;es concerning his mi&s;&s;ion by enabling him to work miracles upon the &s;pot, as you read in the third and fourth of Exodus. And by the &s;ame means, <HI>viz.</HI> a cour&s;e of miracles, he gave the &s;ame &s;atisfaction to the I&s;raelites concerning it. Chri&s;t &s;ent the apo&s;tles, they were a&s;&s;ured, as otherwi&s;e, &s;o by the <HI>power from on high,</HI> that he had &s;ent them, and by exerting that power in a &s;eries of &s;upernatural mi|raculous works, they gave &s;ufficient evidence to the world of their divine mi&s;&s;ion, that God had &s;ent them, and &s;pake by them, and that he owned their te&s;timony and doctrine; as I may more fully &s;hew hereafter.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t argument, the authors of the Bible profe&s;s them&s;elves to be in&s;pired; wherein I have &s;hown, that they could not but know whether they were or not; and that they cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to deceive us in their te&s;timony. I go on now to another argument, which I &s;hall go through more brie&s;ly.</P>
<P N="2">II. As the writers of the Scripture profe&s;s to have their doctrine from God, &s;o it could not be the invention of men. This will abundantly ap|pear in the progre&s;s of my di&s;cour&s;es. What I at pre&s;ent ground my argument upon, is, the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ability of men to contrive &s;uch a book as the Bible, of men as &s;uch, or of any &s;ort of men.</P>
<P>It could not be the contrivance of bad men.
<PB N="141" REF="028262_0144_0FD7F54463453490">Had they invented a religion, &s;urely they would have made it more favorable to their own inclin|ations, lu&s;ts and appetites; would not have fettered them&s;elves, laid them&s;elves under &s;uch re&s;traints as the Bible doth, and denounced &s;uch tremendous judgments again&s;t the ways they chu&s;e and love; they would not have con&s;ulted &s;o entirely the honor of God, and the reputation of virtue and goodne&s;s, as we find the Scripture doth; but would have calculated it more according to their own natures and de&s;igns. I may add, could we &s;uppo&s;e them capable of this, which yet is to make them act con|trary to their nature, we cannot imagine they &s;hould be at &s;o much expence to promote the cau&s;e of the Bible, &s;acrifice their worldly intere&s;ts, and even their lives for the &s;ake of it. Did ever bad men act &s;uch a part, contrive the greate&s;t good, &s;uffer and die to advance it.</P>
<P>It could not be the contrivance of good men. This &s;uppo&s;ition involves them in a guilt, perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with their character. They &s;peak, as you have heard, in the name of God, and profe&s;s to have received their doctrine from him. Now if it was otherwi&s;e, and they were con&s;cious of a forge|ry, they mu&s;t be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;tors in the world, which is &s;o directly contrary to all virtue and hon|e&s;ty, that it can never be imputed to any man that de&s;erves the name of good. In &s;hort, the former &s;uppo&s;ition makes bad men do the be&s;t thing that can be, and this makes good men do the wor&s;t; both which are ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>It could not be the invention of any man or men. This might be demon&s;trated, had I time to &s;tay up|on it; and &s;everal things will afterwards occur that may confirm the a&s;&s;ertion. No man nor body of men could invent &s;uch an hi&s;tory as that of the Bi|ble. A learned Jew, Mana&s;&s;eh Ben I&s;rael, in&s;tan|ces in the account Mo&s;es gives of the creation,
<PB N="142" REF="028262_0145_0FD7F545974FED10">which he maintains could not be his own invention. For no man's rea&s;on, &s;ays he, will dictate to him that the world was made in &s;ix days, and at certain intervals of time, &s;ince it is more for the glory of God's power to make the world in an in&s;tant. Who can imagine, adds he, that the heavens were made without the &s;tars, and adorned with them on the <HI>fourth day?</HI> What judicious mind can con|ceive that the plants were created on the <HI>third day,</HI> and the &s;un on the <HI>fourth,</HI> &s;ince naturally they re|ceive their vegetation from the &s;un? He mentions other particulars, and concludes, the creation of the world was revealed to Adam, and that his po&s;terity had it by tradition from him. But becau&s;e it was not fit, a thing of &s;uch weight &s;hould rely on the authority of one man, God in the &s;econd place ap|peared to Mo&s;es on mount Sinai, and gave him a clear a&s;&s;urance of the&s;e things. Whether this be thought throughout &s;olid or not, the &s;ubject he re|fers to mu&s;t pa&s;s for a pertinent in&s;tance of a hi&s;|tory that has &s;omething more than human in it. Longinus the heathen philo&s;opher, and ma&s;ter of Porphyry, is &s;aid to have admired Mo&s;es's hi&s;tory of the creation; and he makes the account of the fir&s;t day's work, an in&s;tance of the true &s;ublime. There is indeed more &s;atisfaction in it about the original of the world, the author of it, and manner of creation, than in all the books of Pagan philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>And what &s;hall we &s;ay of the many events record|ed in the Bible in a prophetic manner? Some of them many hundreds, and &s;ome &s;everal thou&s;and years before they came to pa&s;s. I cannot enter upon the particulars now, though I may do it here|after, any one that &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders the predicti|ons recorded in the Scripture, mu&s;t &s;ee it could be indicted by no under&s;tanding le&s;s th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n infinite.</P>
<P>I might take notice of the doctrine of the Bible,
<PB N="143" REF="028262_0146_0FD7DACDF7C340D8">and &s;hew how much this exceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> human invention. How maje&s;tic and &s;ublime a part of it? How ad|mirably the whole is &s;itted to the circum&s;tances of man, pre&s;cribing to him in every relation and ca&s;e, an&s;wering all his occa&s;ions and nece&s;&s;ities; and every way adapted at once to promote his happi|ne&s;s and the honor of God. The&s;e and a great many other particulars that might be in&s;i&s;ted upon, &s;hew that the Bible could not be the invention of any human mind, of any man or men, of whatever quality or capacity; and fully prove what the apo&s;tle afferts, that <HI>no prophecy of Scripture is of private in&s;piration,</HI> or impul&s;e, that it <HI>came not by the will of man, but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;everal other arguments to offer, to con|firm the a&s;&s;ertion, but mu&s;t leave them to another opportunity. In the mean time I cannot help re|marking, how unrea&s;onable the cau&s;e of infidelity is. The dei&s;ts and others, that reject the authority of the Bible, do it upon a pretence that would ruin all the hi&s;tory in the world, de&s;troy all human tru&s;t and te&s;timony, and introduce univer&s;al &s;cepti&s;ci&s;m. For if the per&s;ons, who publi&s;hed the Bible, might not be certain of what they &s;aw and felt, of the facts they relate, and in&s;piration they pretend to, no man can be certain of any thing what&s;oever. If we may not depend on &s;uch te&s;timony as that of tho&s;e per|&s;ons, we can depend upon no te&s;timony, nor believe any thing unle&s;s we &s;ee it, nor indeed then neither. For if they might be deceived and deluded, &s;o may others, all others; it could not be expected that any &s;hould have a greater a&s;&s;urance of things than they had, and con&s;equently, there is an end of all evi|dence even of that of the &s;en&s;es; an end of all tru&s;t, of all certainty: &s;o very ab&s;urd is the i&s;&s;ue of in|fidelity.</P>
<P>And I cannot forbear adding, it would be well
<PB N="144" REF="028262_0147_0FD7F548D438AA90">for the&s;e men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at cannot re&s;t in the evidence of the truth and divinity of the Scriptures, could they carry their &s;cepti&s;ci&s;m with them into the other world. But the&s;e unrea&s;onable cavils by which they now &s;upport the wor&s;t cau&s;e, will then vani&s;h, and all will appear real; the truths they de&s;pi&s;ed real, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they feel real, and neither the one nor the other to be run down with a je&s;t and a ban|ter. O let us believe this before-hand, believe Mo|&s;es and the prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, that we come not to the place of torments, and there receive a terrible, as well as unavoidable convic|tion; believe and reverence the Scriptures, and conduct our&s;elves according to the glorious rules thereof. It is the Bible that de&s;cribes heaven and the way to it: it is the light by which a wi&s;e and gracious God would guide us through this world, a dark and dangerous place, and the more we love, &s;tudy and practice the Holy Scripture, the more we &s;hall know of the future heavenly &s;tate, and the fitter we &s;hall be for the enjoyments of it. Let the word of God therefore dwell richly in you. <HI>Peace &s;hall be upon all them that walk according to this rule, and upon the I&s;rael of God.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. The excellency of its doctrine, is an internal character of its divinity. The Bible contains the mo&s;t glorious &s;y&s;tem of religion. Con&s;ider the general &s;cheme of it, and it will appear a revelation admirably &s;uited to the ca&s;e and circum&s;tances of men, and every way worthy of God.</P>
<P>That we are fallen creatures, and, as &s;uch, guilty and defiled, all the world is, or may be convinced by their own experience. The wi&s;er heathens were &s;en&s;ible of this, though how to account for it they knew not. <HI>Whence comes evil?</HI> was a que&s;tion they could not re&s;olve. What more agreeable to the acknowledged perfections of God, that infinite goodne&s;s, kindne&s;s, and love we a&s;cribe to the Cre|ator of the world, and Father of all things, than to pity, relieve, and re&s;tore his lo&s;t creatures? And what method more congruous and &s;uitable to that end, than that which is laid down in the Scripture, namely, by repentance, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins through the mediation and atonement of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? What was more nece&s;&s;ary for God to do for us, than to forgive our ill, and make us good again? And what way to remove the guilt of &s;in, but his grace, &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould make him &s;atisfaction? As for the method in which he has done it, by the &s;acrifice of his Son, though we cannot at pre&s;ent comprehend the depth of that de&s;ign, it appears however a di&s;pen&s;ation full of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, highly tending to advance the honor of God, and &s;ecure the gratitude and obedience of the creature. This is the general &s;cope of all the evangelical writings. They repre|&s;ent the plan and council of infinite wi&s;dom for the &s;alvation of &s;inners through the Lord Je&s;us, make known the purpo&s;e of God for the redemption and recovery of fallen man, the method, means, and terms thereof; a contrivance &s;o wonderfully a|dapted to the great end it is refferred to, and in|cluding
<PB N="147" REF="028262_0150_0FD7F5500733B448">&s;o profound a my&s;tery both of wi&s;dom and grace as &s;peaks its author, and &s;hews it could not be of man, but from God.</P>
<P>Which would appear with greater advantage, could we here &s;urvey more particularly the doc|trines of the Scripture. The Bible is a revelation, a di&s;tinct and full revelation, of all that concerns our duty and happine&s;s, of all that it behoves us to know and practice. I might illu&s;trate this, in the three great branches of religion, as it refers to God, our neighbor and our&s;elves. With reference to God, we are there in&s;tructed in all the particulars of religion as he is the object of it. For in&s;tance, we have a glorious di&s;covery of the divine nature and will. I grant that the being and attributes of God are not to be proved from Scripture, a belief and &s;ome knowledge of the&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to the belief of the Bible. The divine perfections, e&s;pecially his goodne&s;s and veracity or truth, are the greate&s;t &s;ecurity we can have that we are not deceived in embracing the Scriptures as a divine revelation. And the&s;e perfections are otherwi&s;e to be demon|&s;trated and mu&s;t be known beforehand. The evi|dence of them doth not fir&s;t and chiefly depend on the account we have of them in the Bible. But notwith&s;tanding, it may ju&s;tly be reckoned among the benefits and advantages of Scripture revelation, and among the excellencies thereof, that it gives us &s;o clear a view of the perfections of the divine na|ture. <HI>Mo&s;es and the prophets revealed God to the world, and the only begotten Son, that lay in the bo&s;om of the Father, who is the brightne&s;s of his glory, the ex|pre&s;s image of his per&s;on,</HI> hath more fully revealed him. The Bible makes God known in his nature as the one God, the living and true God, infinitely wi&s;e, powerful, ju&s;t and good; the ble&s;&s;ed and only potentate, who alone hath immortality, whom no
<PB N="148" REF="028262_0151_0FD7F5513122FAC0">man hath &s;een, or can &s;ee. It makes known the glorious my&s;tery of the trinity, repre&s;ents the three divine per&s;ons jointly carrying on the work of our &s;alvation, acting &s;everal and di&s;tinct parts in this great affair, according to the council of the divine will, and all con&s;piring in the &s;ame de&s;ign and end. A di&s;pen&s;ation of wi&s;dom and grace, that no book in the world can pretend to give an account of but the Bible.</P>
<P>We have here al&s;o a full di&s;covery of our duty towards God in the di&s;&s;erent parts thereof; as, that we mu&s;t love him with all our heart, &s;oul, mind and &s;trength; that we fear him, and fear him above all others, as being <HI>able to ca&s;t both body and &s;oul into hell;</HI> that we tru&s;t in him, hope in him, rejoice in him, and the like; that we wor&s;hip him, outwardly by prayer, prai&s;e, thank&s;giving and fa&s;ting; and as to the manner, that we <HI>wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth;</HI> that we <HI>lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting,</HI> and that we <HI>do every thing in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</HI> A glorious plan of religious wor&s;hip this! grounded upon the perfections of the divine nature, and mediation of Chri&s;t, and admirably corre&s;|ponding with the ca&s;e and nece&s;&s;ities of &s;inful man.</P>
<P>As to our duty towards our neighbor, nothing can exceed the rules and pre&s;criptions of the Scrip|ture herein. We are commanded to <HI>love our neigh|bor as our&s;elves;</HI> and whatever we would that men &s;hould do to us, we are required to do even &s;o to them; which glorious and divine laws the great author of the Bible hath there more particularly explained, and filled up with &s;uch in&s;tances of ju&s;|tice, charity and love, that nothing can be added to them. He requires, that we put away all bit|terne&s;s, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil-&s;peaking; that we lie not one to another, nor take up a re|proach again&s;t our neighbor; that we be gentle and
<PB N="149" REF="028262_0152_0FD7F5597541AAC0">courteous, that we be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for|gives us; that we walk with all lowline&s;s and meek|ne&s;s, with long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another in love; that we owe no man any thing but love; and in a word, that we imitate the great pattern of goodne&s;s, our heavenly Father, and with a charity as exten&s;ive as the beams and influence of the &s;un, do good again&s;t evil, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us; for|give, pray for, and love our enemies, and overcome evil with good.</P>
<P>I might &s;hew at large, what provi&s;ion is made, in the rules laid down in the Scripture, for the duty and comfort of the &s;everal &s;pecial relations men &s;tand in towards one another. In whatever &s;tations men are placed, by the providence of God, the way of duty is there made plain before them; which did they mind and pur&s;ue, the con&s;equence would be the beauty and order of the world, the peace and harmony of &s;ociety. Every office, was it di&s;|charged according to the direction of God's word, would appear glorious and u&s;eful among mankind, and every relation amiable and comfortable. The magi&s;trate is here taught how to be a guardian of the &s;ociety, to defend and &s;erve it in all u&s;eful mi|ni&s;tries, agreeably to the original de&s;ign and in&s;titu|tion of his office, and therefore he is required to be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God, to be a terror to evil works, and a prai&s;e to the good. Parents are here taught, with what tenderne&s;s and care, to con|duct and provide for their children; to treat them as an holy &s;eed, con&s;eerated to God, bringing them <HI>up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI> And that mo&s;t intinate relation between hu&s;band and wife is made an emblem and &s;igure of the relation between Chri&s;t and the church. The hu&s;band is to love his wi&s;e, as Chri&s;t the church, the wife to ob&s;erve and reverence her hu&s;band, as the church doth
<PB N="150" REF="028262_0153_0FD7F55B71E740D8">Chri&s;t; and both together are to make up a lively image of the love and &s;ubjection there is between Chri&s;t and the church. And &s;hould I pur&s;ue the account through all other relations, as &s;ubjects and children, mini&s;ters and people, ma&s;ters and &s;er|vants; and &s;et before you the &s;everal precepts and rules of Scripture for the conduct of per&s;ons in tho&s;e relations, the excellency of the doctrine of the Bible might be demon&s;trated from thence to the conviction of all. It would appear, how well it is calculated to promote the good of &s;ociety, and that it mu&s;t proceed, not only from a friend to mankind, but one that perfectly under&s;tands the human nature, that knows what there is in man, and what man is; what is the ju&s;t decorum of every action, and what becomes him in every &s;tate; that under&s;tands his intere&s;ts, defects and wants; what belongs to his whole duty, and what would contri|bute to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But to touch a little the next particular, our duty towards our&s;elves, here the Bible exceeds all other in&s;titutes, all the laws and maxims of the moral phi|lo&s;ophers, though it is granted, &s;ome of them have &s;poke admirably on this head. The Scripture above all other books teaches us the knowledge of our|&s;elves. It enjoins, that we &s;hould not think of our|&s;elves <HI>more highly than we ought to think, but to think &s;obely, according as God has dealt to every man the mea&s;ure of faith.</HI> And it hath directed us to make a right e&s;timate of our&s;elves, preferring the &s;oul to the body, and the intere&s;ts thereof, to all the little concerns of the pre&s;ent life. Which is the import of Chri&s;t's doctrine, <HI>What is a man pro&s;ited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?</HI> The Scripture teaches us the proportion of our cares, and the moderation and government of our pa&s;&s;ions in a mo&s;t exact and divine manner. Tells us one
<PB N="151" REF="028262_0154_0FD7F55D96FC1C08">thing is needful, bids us not <HI>labor for the meat which peri&s;hes, but for that which endureth unto everla&s;ting life,</HI> to take no thought for the body, &s;aying, <HI>what &s;hall we eat, or what &s;hall we drink, or wherewithal &s;hall we be clothed.</HI> And becau&s;e the mind of man is too confined and limited to be intent upon two &s;tudies at once, which tend to divide and di&s;tract it, we cannot &s;erve two ma&s;ters, we are therefore re|quired to give up the one, whenever it comes in competition with the other, and to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And how many and excellent its rules concern|ing &s;obriety, moderation, humility, temperance, cha&s;tity, and the like. It enjoins us to <HI>mortify our members which are on the earth, fornication, unclean|ne&s;s, inordinate affections and evil concupi&s;cence;</HI> to take heed le&s;t our <HI>hearts be over-charged with &s;ur|feiting and drunkenne&s;s and cares of this life;</HI> to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s our ve&s;&s;el in fanctification and honor;</HI> to be content with &s;uch things as we have, and to depend on the providence and promi&s;e of God, who hath &s;aid, he will never leave us nor for&s;ake us. In a word, the Bible pre&s;cribes to men in every &s;tate and circum&s;tance, and lays down mo&s;t excellent laws and rules, &s;uch as tend to reform and perfect their natures, to make them comfortable, u&s;eful and happy in this and the other world; it regulates their de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions and affections, and as it is in the ver&s;e following the text, <HI>is able to make the man of God perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good work.</HI></P>
<P>Let me add what I ob&s;erved before, <HI>viz.</HI> What|ever is excellent in natural religion, and to be found among the philo&s;ophers, is all of it taken into the Bible. And further, the Bible repre&s;ents the &s;ame with much advantage; what lies &s;cattered in the books of the heathen philo&s;ophers, and mu&s;t have been gathered from thence with much care and difficulty, is here brought to our hands and &s;et be|fore
<PB N="152" REF="028262_0155_0FD7F55E9C1F3030">us in a &s;hort &s;ummary, truths that were hid under much rubbi&s;h and mixed with many mi&s;takes are here pure and clear, and without adulteration. And again, the Bible &s;upplies the defects of natural religion; &s;ome of the&s;e have been before taken notice of, and I &s;hall now enlarge.</P>
<P>Natural religion, or the light of rea&s;on, &s;ays no|thing of the my&s;tery and redemption of the Son of God incarnate, it di&s;covers nothing certainly of the pardon of &s;in, the terms and means of it, and no|thing at all of the atonement by the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t; it leaves us very much in the dark about the main article and foundation of all religion, a future eternal &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; and indeed is lame and imperfect, as to moral duties and virtues. It is ob&s;ervable, that the philo&s;ophers have no name for that eminent chri&s;tian grace of humility. What we call &s;o, pa&s;&s;es with them for abjectne&s;s and lowne&s;s of mind; nay, &s;o unaccount|able was their vanity, that they thought a wi&s;e man might make him&s;elf happy, and was not beholden to God for his virtues. Ari&s;totle places &s;everal things in the cla&s;tes of virtues, which the Scripture brands as vices and &s;inful di&s;orders; as indignation and di&s;plea&s;ure at the pro&s;perity of unworthy men, &s;o expre&s;sly cen&s;ured in many places of the Bible; a di&s;po&s;ition to je&s;ting, a lightne&s;s of di&s;cour&s;e, the philo&s;opher repre&s;ents as a virtue, and the apo&s;tle condemns as not convenient among chri&s;tians, not being &s;uitable to the gravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y with which a chri&s;tian ought to conduct him&s;elf. Greatne&s;s of mind, which he defines, a man's judging him&s;elf to be worthy of great things, and accordingly pur&s;uing them with an elevation of mind; thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o has the character of a virtue and excellency with that philo&s;opher. But how contrary it is to that mode&s;ty, aba&s;ement, and &s;elf-denial, the becoming little children, &s;aying, af|ter we have done all, that we are unprofitable &s;er|vants,
<PB N="153" REF="028262_0156_0FD7F55FD6CAAFB0">which the Scripture recommends I need not &s;tand to &s;hew.</P>
<P>I might ob&s;erve, that &s;everal of the greate&s;t phi|lo&s;ophers allowed lying, theft, fornication, &s;elf|murder, &amp;c. Even the famous Cato thought it was a point of honor to make away his own life, rather than fall into the hands of Cae&s;ar: which Seneca, one of their &s;tricte&s;t morali&s;ts, is &s;o far from bla|ming in him, that he undertakes his vindication, and applauds him for the greatne&s;s of his mind. Thus mixed and corrupted was their divinity, even among tho&s;e that had mo&s;t refined it.</P>
<P>But nothing of this can be charged upon the Scripture. It has none of the&s;e blemi&s;hes and de|fects. As it &s;upplies what is wanting in their reli|gion, &s;o it corrects what is wrong in their edition of morality. It recommends every grace, pre&s;cribes an entire holine&s;s without any blots and &s;tains, ac|cording to that of the P&s;almi&s;t, which he mentions as an encomium upon the word of God, and one rea&s;on of his affection to it, <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul; the &s;tatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the Lord,</HI> that is, the word or law of God teaching religion, or the fear of the Lord, <HI>is clean, enduring forever.</HI> The&s;e are properties of the law of God, the&s;e are excellencies of the Scripture. It con|tains a doctrine according to Godline&s;s, admirably &s;uited to promote the great ends of religion and Godline&s;s in the world. And though I will not call this, and the other argument under this cla&s;s and order, demon&s;tration; yet I think they have a great deal of force in them. It is certain, if we might expect a revelation from God, the Scripture is &s;uch a revelation as we might expect from him. It is a revelation every way becoming him; and to &s;uppo&s;e it came from an impo&s;tor, as mu&s;t be the
<PB N="154" REF="028262_0157_0FD7F5629DA1C120">ca&s;e if it be not from God, is very unrea&s;onable and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d. It is in its contrivance above the reach and capacity of any man, and it is manife&s;t, the &s;tructure and frame of it is quite contrary to the gu&s;t and heart of a bad man.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;pirituality of its nature, its divine ten|dency, may be pleaded to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and reckoned among the internal characters and marks of its divinity. And here I might take notice that no book condemns &s;in like the Bible, and appears again&s;t it with &s;o &s;trong an oppo&s;ition. It &s;trikes at the very root of it in the thoughts, heart and de&s;ires, and pur&s;ues it through every part of the conver&s;ation and life; repre&s;ents it as the abomi|nable thing which God hates, and threatens it with eternal death.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o remark, that no book &s;o much and &s;o effectually teaches us to deny &s;elf and exalt God, as the Bible doth; to refer all to him, and give him the glory of every attainment.</P>
<P>Thus the apo&s;tle, <HI>by the grace of God I am what I am.</HI> And having taken notice of his labors, his more abundant labors, in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel, he adds, neverthele&s;s, <HI>not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</HI> And el&s;ewhere, <HI>I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints.</HI> And again, <HI>though I be nothing.</HI> Where will you find any &s;trains like this in all the volumes of the philo&s;ophers. So far from it, that pride and &s;elf-exaltation was their great idol; honor, applau&s;e, and glory, the main &s;pring of all their actions; even of their more generous at|chievements, when they &s;acrificed their lives for the good of their country. But the Bible breaths all &s;elf-denial, it teaches, that whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we &s;hould do all to the glory of God; that we &s;hould not receive honor from men, but be content with the honor that cometh from God only.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="028262_0158_0FD7F563A04444E8">
I will only &s;ubjoin under this head as a glorious character of Scripture, that it every where recom|mends and promotes a right frame and po&s;ture of &s;oul towards God, and what I may call a devotional temper. The main &s;cope of heathen philo&s;ophy, was to regulate the pa&s;&s;ions, which it is granted was a noble &s;ubject; or to direct them in homiletical and &s;ocial virtues. The fir&s;t tended to fit them for conver&s;e with them&s;elves, and the other with their fellow creatures. But for conver&s;e and intercour&s;e with God in the exerci&s;e of divine graces, tho&s;e morali&s;ts knew little of it. There is a deep &s;ilence in their writings about it. And I am &s;orry to find there is &s;o much of the like defect in the di&s;cour&s;es and writings of others, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and profe&s;|&s;ion it is to explain the Bible, and recommend the religion there taught to the world. In the mean time, the Scripture has this mark of divinity in it throughout; every part of divine revelation leads to God, to a devout communion and conver&s;e with him; and in order to this it directs us to beg for the holy &s;pirit, to &s;anctify the nature, impre&s;s, renew, and transform the mind, and thereby prepare us for this divine and heavenly employment. It pre|&s;cribes rules of inward and outward purity, that we may not lo&s;e the devout frame. It appoints &s;olemn ordinances as &s;o many means and opportunities of intercour&s;e with God. And I might &s;hew you that this has been the temper of good men in every age of revelation. How much it was of David parti|cularly, under the Old Te&s;tament, every one knows that has read and con&s;idered his P&s;alms. You of|ten hear him &s;peaking in the&s;e, and the like &s;trains, <HI>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, &s;o panteth my &s;oul after thee, O God. In thy favor is life, thy loving-kindne&s;s is better than life. A day in thy courts is better than a thou&s;and. My &s;oul thir&s;teth for thee,
<PB N="156" REF="028262_0159_0FD7F565613E50A0">my fle&s;h longeth for thee, to &s;ee thy power and thy glory, &s;o as I have &s;een thee in the &s;anctuary.</HI> Nor are the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the peculiar experience of David, but pious breathings that in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uit all good men, and de&s;cribe the heart and frame of the church of God. And you have a great deal to the like purpo&s;e in the book of Canticles, which mu&s;t al&s;o be under&s;tood in the &s;ame latitude.</P>
<P>In &s;hort the Bible is a book of devotion: &s;o it may not unfitly be termed. It not only pre&s;cribes it, but &s;eems very much calculated to promote it. Its principles and articles of faith, its rules and laws, its ordinances of wor&s;hip, are all directed to this end; to elevate and rai&s;e the mind to God, to bring him and his &s;oul near together. The &s;pirit and grace it be&s;tows are for the &s;ame purpo&s;e given to refine the nature, purify the heart, and fit the &s;oul for the divine pre&s;ence and embraces. And ac|cordingly all the great heroes of the Bible, tho&s;e divine &s;ouls that have lived under the impre&s;&s;ion of its doctrines, have been men of devotion, a temper that the greate&s;t among the philo&s;ophers, as I have hinted, were very much &s;trangers to.</P>
<P>Now from hence without further enlargement, I think I may ju&s;tly piece this among the characters of divinity, that we may di&s;cern upon the Scripture. It is pure and &s;piritual, wholly favors of God. It &s;o directly leads to him in the de&s;ign of it, that one cannot but infer it comes from him. It teaches to live godly, as well as &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly. It pre&s;cribes an high point, the dignity and glory of human minds, which the light of nature a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the philo&s;ophy of the heathens fell &s;hort of, <HI>viz.</HI> a friend|ly commerce with God.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is &s;omething in the &s;tyle of the Scrip|ture, that favors of divinity. As for in&s;tance, the maje&s;ty and grandeur of it. I do not mean with re&s;pect to pompous figures, or any rhetorical flou|ri&s;hes
<PB N="157" REF="028262_0160_0FD7F56E68AD2D70">and flights of oratory: but with re&s;pect to the authority with which it &s;peaks. It &s;peaks in the name of the great God, the maker of heaven and earth, and demands the attention of the whole world. Some have ob&s;erved there is a great deal of maje&s;ty in that often repeated expre&s;&s;ion of our Saviour, <HI>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</HI> Which is a &s;olemn admonition to mankind of the mighty importance of the thing &s;poken. What I would chiefly remark, is the awful &s;anctions with which this book enforces its laws and precepts, no le&s;s than eternal rewards and eternal puni&s;hments. <HI>Hear, and your &s;oul &s;hall live. He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved; and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Such as this, is the language of the Scrip|ture, and hereby it is too &s;ublime and great for any human lawgiver. How far any might have gone in this way, per&s;onating the &s;upreme maje&s;ty of God, and abu&s;ing the world with a counterfeit of his divine authority, is not ea&s;y to &s;ay. But it has been ob&s;erved, that no book has ever yet come forth, that has &s;poke with &s;uch a &s;ublimity and height of &s;overeignty, as the Bible doth.</P>
<P>Further, there is an admirable &s;implicity mixed with the authority. This appears in the laws con|tained in the Scriptures, particularly, the ten com|mandments. Every thing is delivered with an air of greatne&s;s, and yet with a plainne&s;s that cannot be enough admired. <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other gods before me. Thou &s;halt not make unto thy&s;elf any gra|ven image, &amp;c.. Thou &s;halt not take the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame of the Lord thy God in vain, &amp;c. Thou &s;halt not kill. Thou &s;halt not &s;teal,</HI> and the like. I know &s;ome make this, which they call a lowne&s;s and flatne&s;s of &s;tyle, an objection again&s;t the divinity of the Bible. But it is a cavil without all rea&s;on. There is really a grande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in &s;uch &s;implicity. Even human lawgiv|ers would think it a diminution to them to deliver
<PB N="158" REF="028262_0161_0FD7F56E8F2DB248">their laws in the &s;train of an orator, Speeches from the throne, the edicts of princes, and acts of parli|ament, come forth in naked plain terms, and the greater their &s;implicity and plainne&s;s, the greater marks of authority they have in them. Per&s;ons who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to per&s;uade, addre&s;s to the pa&s;|&s;ions of men, and make u&s;e of their art; but where the highe&s;t authority &s;peaks, and the will of the &s;peaker is a law, the more plainne&s;s there is in the &s;tyle, the more authoritative it appears.</P>
<P>There is the like &s;implicity in the narrations and hi&s;tory of Scripture. The writers delivered things without di&s;gui&s;e, relate facts, even the mo&s;t wonder|ful and &s;urpri&s;ing, and their &s;everal circum&s;tances, with freedom and boldne&s;s; like men that are con|&s;cious of their integrity, and depend upon the dig|nity and importance of the things they report, and the authority of him that &s;ent them. They make u&s;e of no artful apologies, nor &s;tudied addre&s;&s;es, to po&s;&s;e&s;s their readers in their favor. When they command it is with a maje&s;tic plainne&s;s, as tho&s;e that &s;peak in the name of God, and when they re|late pa&s;t things it is with the like &s;implicity, as tho&s;e that &s;peak in the name of truth, as I may &s;ay.</P>
<P>Now this is &s;o far from being the manner of im|po&s;tors and cheats, that it is not really the manner of common men. I do not think any men, left to the conduct of their own wi&s;dom and under&s;tand|ing, would have repre&s;ented &s;uch things, as the Bible contains, in the way the writers of it do; making their reports, and delivering their me&s;&s;ages with a freedom and indifference of &s;tyle, that may &s;eem rather to favour of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, than any thing of affectation. And though I do not &s;ay, that the&s;e, and the like properties and characters of the Scrip|ture &s;tyle, are a full argument of its divinity; yet I cannot help thinking the &s;tyle thereof has a great deal in it recommending; it is &s;omething worthy
<PB N="159" REF="028262_0162_0FD7F57124B1EFA8">of God, and what one might expect in a divine re|velation.</P>
<P N="4">4. The harmony and agreement of the &s;everal parts of the Bible is another mark and character of the in&s;piration of the writers thereof. Particular|ly, there is an harmony in the greate&s;t point of all, I mean exact truth. Survey the Scriptures from the beginning to the end, examine the part every penman has born in this compo&s;ure, and there is nothing to be found, but what can &s;tand the te&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;evere and critical judgment. It may be affirmed of all the &s;acred writings without ex|ception, what is affirmed of &s;ome part, <HI>the&s;e &s;ayings are faithful and true.</HI> Let us reflect a little on this matter. The Scripture con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;orts of &s;ubjects, doctrines, hi&s;tories, and prophecies. And in none of the&s;e can it be convicted of fal&s;e|hood. As to its doctrines, you have heard that it compri&s;es a very glorious and large &s;y&s;tem, articles of faith, rules of practice, all were concerned to know, believe, and do; our whole duty towards God, our neighbor, and our&s;elves. And in all this there is no flaw, no fal&s;e doctrine. No caviller in the world is able to pronounce upon evidence con|cerning any principal, maxim, or rule laid down in the Bible, that it is corrupt and erroneous; what cannot bear the trial of &s;ound and impartial rea&s;on. As to the hi&s;torical and prophetical part, it is of great extent, takes in a compa&s;s of &s;ome thou&s;and years; and yet here one may challenge all the adver&s;aries of the Scripture to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of mi&s;take, any facts mi&s;repre&s;ented, or any predictions given forth, di&s;graced by the event; which is a circum&s;tance that di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all human compo&s;ures, and gives it a &s;ort of triumph over all competitors. In the be&s;t writings of unin&s;pired men there are marks of frailty and infirmity, weakne&s;s of judgments, &s;lips of memory,
<PB N="160" REF="028262_0163_0FD7F5712900FE78">inconclu&s;ive arguments, mi&s;taken facts, and the like. But there is nothing of this in the Bible. All is without a blot, true and irreproveable.</P>
<P>Further, this harmony is among all the writers of the Scriptures. They not only &s;peak truths, but many of them the very &s;ame particular truths. When they touch the &s;ame doctrine they give the &s;ame account of it, the &s;ame in the main, no one contradicting or interfering with another. They teach the &s;ame things concerning God, his nature, attributes, providence and government; give the &s;ame account of the creation, apo&s;tacy, general flood, and other facts of ancient date. The New Te&s;tament writers deliver the &s;ame things concern|ing Chri&s;t, his incarnation, death, burial, re&s;urrec|tion, a&s;cen&s;ion; his doctrine, miracles; the com|ing of the Holy Gho&s;t, and the like. Not that they copy from one another, or expre&s;s the &s;ame parti|cular thoughts upon every &s;ubject. But there is no repugnancy among them. They harmoni&s;e in every thing. One may enlarge upon and explain what another has &s;aid, add to his account and carry it further; but he never contradicts him.</P>
<P>Again, this harmony is among a great number of per&s;ons, living in very di&s;tant places and ages of the world; &s;o that they could not act by confe|deracy and combination. The prophets that follow Mo&s;es, and who confirm his hi&s;tory, laws and pre|dictions, had, many of them, never &s;een him. Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, that lived above a thou&s;and years after Mo&s;es, all agree with him. In &s;hort, they are all of a piece; their revelations, their doctrines and narrations, accord as much as if they had lived at the &s;ame time; had done every thing by concert and contrivance before one word was written. This will appear afterwards with more advantage when I &s;peak of the prophecies of the Bible, and their accompli&s;hment. I &s;hall only at
<PB N="161" REF="028262_0164_0FD7F57299D1C590">pre&s;ent mention one in&s;tance for the illu&s;tration of what I am upon. Mo&s;es writes that the <HI>&s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</HI> This was a promi&s;e made to our fir&s;t parents in paradi&s;e imme|diately upon the apo&s;tacy, about four thou&s;and years before it came to pa&s;s. This Mo&s;es records, places in his hi&s;tory, lays his credit upon it, and leaves it to the examination of after ages. The &s;ucceeding prophets likewi&s;e, all with one voice bear te&s;timony to the &s;ame thing, point out the &s;ame glorious event till it was actually accompli&s;hed. They re&s;ume the &s;ubject and comment upon it, one after another, and in one age after another, &s;till enlightening it more and more, one adding this, ano|ther a different circum&s;tance; as of what family he &s;hould come, of what per&s;on, namely, a virgin, where he &s;hould be born, at what time, and the like; which I take to be an irre&s;i&s;table evidence of their in&s;piration, and that their <HI>prophecy came not of their own will,</HI> but that they <HI>&s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> otherwi&s;e they could ne|ver have agreed in an event &s;o &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing as this. Had Mo&s;es &s;poke of it on his own head, what could induce the other prophets to venture upon the &s;ame prediction, with more par|ticular and determining circum&s;tances. This would never have been the doctrine of one prophet, re|touched and enlarged by others, and confirmed by all, had they not been guided by the &s;ame &s;pirit, and proceeded under the conduct of God. In a word, all the parts of the Bible are in clo&s;e con|nection, and like the &s;everal parts of a regular building, give &s;trength and &s;upport to one another. The Old Te&s;tament contains th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> New in types, &s;hadows and predictions; and the New Te&s;tament is an accompli&s;hment of the Old. Hence the apo&s;|tle takes notice in his defence before Agrippa, that he had &s;aid no other things than what Mo&s;es and
<PB N="162" REF="028262_0165_0FD7F5742D766998">the prophets had foretold &s;hould come to pa&s;s. <HI>Even all the prophets, that have been &s;ince the world began, &s;pake of the&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P>I might &s;ubjoin, that this harmony appears the more beautiful and divine, as it is with &s;ome cir|cum&s;tantial variety and difference. They preach the &s;ame doctrine, but not in the &s;ame manner, relate the &s;ame facts, but not with the like circum&s;tances; and often foretell the &s;ame events, but place them in a different light and cloath them with different circum&s;tances, which is &s;o far from di&s;paraging their writings, that it really gives reputation to them, and is an argument of their &s;incerity and in&s;piration. Had they acted with a fraudulent de&s;ign they would have been more cautious in this re&s;pect, and avoid|ed all appearance of di&s;cord; had they contrived a deceit, they would have laid it clo&s;er together, and not have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to any &s;u&s;picion of contradiction. Common writers think them&s;elves obliged for their credit-&s;ake to guard every ex|pre&s;&s;ion, are timorous and anxious, e&s;pecially if there be any de&s;ign of fal&s;hood an impo&s;ture. But the &s;acred writers conduct them&s;elves with a noble freedom of expre&s;&s;ion, as being &s;ecure of the truth and ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and that under all this variety, the &s;ame divine truth would appear and triumph upon examination.</P>
<P>Well, as this is the ca&s;e of the Bible; as there is &s;uch a wonderful agreement and harmony among the writers of it; it mu&s;t, I think, imply and in|fer their in&s;piration. It is not to be conceived, that a weak and fallible under&s;tanding, as that of man is, &s;hould go through &s;uch a variety of matter, doctrines, hi&s;tories, prophecies, of exceeding great latitude and compa&s;s, and always be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. We do not find that two per&s;ons can write on the &s;ame &s;ubject, e&s;pecially if it be copious and diffu&s;ive, without cla&s;hing; nor can one man write
<PB N="163" REF="028262_0166_0FD7F57593C3A1A0">on a multitude of &s;ubjects, but he will forget him|&s;elf, and &s;how his weakne&s;s and infirmity. Where|as the Scripture is clear of all imputation of this kind, I mean all ju&s;t and well grounded imputation. As to the objection of contradictions therein, I may afterwards con&s;ider it; at pre&s;ent I take it for granted there are none and thence argue, that they who wrote it were under the &s;pecial and infallible influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, who led them into all truth.</P>
<P N="5">5. I may offer to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, or as a fur|ther proof of the in&s;piration of Scripture, that effi|cacy, power and authority, it has on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earts and con&s;ciences of men. Indeed this may be thought an effect of the Scripture, and accounted extrin&s;ic; and con&s;equently, not here in its proper place. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the efficacy I am arguing from, is owing to the internal con&s;titution of the Bible, and to the divine &s;pirit that breathes in it. Now take this in conjunction with the other arguments, and I look upon it a great confirmation of our faith, that it is the word of God. I &s;hall beg leave to enlarge a little here. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. I ob&s;erve, that the Scripture is attended with a penetrating light; has a great deal of efficacy and power in this re&s;pect. It &s;hines into the mind, and lays open the mo&s;t &s;ecret, concealed trea&s;ures of it; the good or evil trea&s;ure of the heart. Thus the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of it, as many under&s;tand that text, <HI>the word of God is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than any two-edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</HI> God that made the heart, is perfectly well acquainted with all its workings, de&s;ires and motions, <HI>he knows our thoughts afar off;</HI> he knows all that is in man, and has in his word, as
<PB N="164" REF="028262_0167_0FD7F57BC93A84B0">in a map or gla&s;s, delineated and repre&s;ented the various movements of his &s;oul, what is formed in his heart, and lodges at any time there. Thus St. Paul, &s;peaking of prophecy, or the opening of the Scripture by virtue of that afflatus or gift of the &s;pirit which &s;ome had at that time, tells us, that by the means thereof, <HI>the unlearned and unbeliever is convinced of all, and judged of all.</HI> It follows, <HI>and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are the &s;ecrets of his heart made manife&s;t, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alling down on his face, he will wor&s;hip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</HI> The word of God often finds the &s;inner out, and when it is di&s;|played before him, God co-operating therewith by his &s;pirit, there is a di&s;covery made of the heart and con&s;cience, and of the thoughts and purpo&s;es lurk|ing there, that often a&s;toni&s;hes and amazes. What the king of Syria's &s;ervant told his ma&s;ter, <HI>viz.</HI> that the prophet Eli&s;ha made known to the king of I&s;|rael even the <HI>words that he &s;pake in his bed-chamber,</HI> may be &s;aid of the Scripture, it makes known to men the language &s;poken in the &s;ecret chambers of their hearts; their mo&s;t retired thoughts and affec|tions. It di&s;clo&s;es the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty, anatomi&s;es and di&s;&s;ects the con&s;cience, brings into open and full light, what the &s;inner before was not aware of. This thou&s;ands can witne&s;s that have been &s;eriou&s;ly conver&s;ant with the holy Scriptures, and e&s;pecially &s;uch that have &s;at under a lively &s;earching mini&s;try. They find their &s;ins, their &s;e|cret &s;ins, &s;et in a clear light, find them&s;elves &s;truck at, and de&s;cribed in the word of God with great exactne&s;s, as if the writer or preacher had known their hearts, and been &s;ome way privy to what pa&s;&s;es there. The rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which is, that the Scripture, proceeding from God, the author of the human mind, that is acquainted with its mo&s;t &s;e|cret &s;prings, and inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es, is able to pene|trate into it, and lay all open.</P>
<PB N="165" REF="028262_0168_0FD7F57BCB729678">
<P>I might ob&s;erve that the light thereof equally reaches the hearts and ca&s;es of good men. It &s;hews them what they are, what they want, what they &s;uffer; de&s;cribes their graces, their conflicts, and fears. In &s;hort, it is a gla&s;s in which both good and bad may view them&s;elves, and &s;ee what manner of per&s;ons they are. Now had it been a mere human writing, a contrivance of men, though of never &s;uch great and wi&s;e men, it could not I think have had this property in it. It would not have been a &s;earcher of hearts, as it every where pretends to be, and we find it to be, had it not proceeded from him that framed the heart and knows it perfectly.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture has a wonderful power and efficacy to convince and awaken con&s;cience. A great deal might be &s;aid here, agreeable to the ex|perience of thou&s;ands and myriads among man|kind. The world hath had a real and &s;en&s;ible ex|periment of this property thereof for many gener|ations. It has been gloriou&s;ly in&s;trumental to di&s;|cover the fig leaves, and detect the delu&s;ion of blinded &s;inners, and to demoli&s;h tho&s;e refuges of lies wherein they tru&s;ted. How many mountains hath it thrown down? how many &s;ons of pride hath it aba&s;ed? how many obdurate and hard hearts hath it broken? many a &s;oul hath the Scripture covered with the &s;hadow of death, even of tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves full of light, and while they have exalted them&s;elves to heaven, it hath brought them down even to hell. Thus the Scripture hath often been to the &s;ecure &s;inner, as the hand writing on the wall to Bel&s;hazzar, <HI>it hath made his countenance change, and his thoughts trouble him, the joints of his loins to be loo&s;ed, and his knees to &s;mite one again&s;t another.</HI> Something of this it is &s;uppo&s;ed the apo&s;tle intimates, when he &s;ays, <HI>I was alive without the law, but when the commandment came, &s;in revived, and I died. Then the commandment which was ordained to
<PB N="166" REF="028262_0169_0FD7F57D6568F338">life, I found to be unto death;</HI> that is, when the law was &s;ent home to my con&s;cience in its &s;piritu|ality, purity and authority. When God carried it to my heart, and removed the ignorance, prejudice, and blindne&s;s which kept the law from reaching me; when it was thus I died, I was filled with amaze|ment and horror at the view of my&s;elf upon this di&s;covery the law made of my heart, &s;tate and con|dition; and I became as a dead man. Now this the Scripture has done in innumerable in&s;tances, with a &s;trange &s;overeignty and authority, ran&s;acking the hearts of men, ca&s;ting them down from their high towers, and laying their pride in the du&s;t. And is there nothing of God in this? is it not ma|nife&s;tly his finger? can any human writings pretend to &s;uch a force? mu&s;t not a word armed with &s;o much power be the word of God? It is ob&s;ervable the Hebrews call thunder the voice of God, <HI>the voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of maje&s;ty, the voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lobanon.</HI> And the rea&s;on why it is termed his voice &s;eems to be, becau&s;e of the maje&s;ty and ter|ror that &s;ometimes attends it. <HI>Ha&s;t thou an arm like God,</HI> &s;aith he him&s;elf to Job, <HI>or can&s;t thou thunder with a voice like him.</HI> Now certainly to thunder in the minds and con&s;ciences of men, and to make &s;uch terrible commotions and concu&s;&s;ions there, as the Scripture doth, cannot but argue &s;omething of divinity, and import that it is the voice of God.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, men may have terror from other cau&s;es, and without the mini&s;try of the Scripture, I grant it; God can &s;trike the con&s;cience of a &s;e|cure &s;inner immediately, or by what means he plea&s;es. But I believe I may ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, that trouble of mind, of a &s;piritual nature, and about another world and the concerns of it, is &s;eldom the exerci&s;e of any but &s;uch as are conver&s;ant with the Bible: and it is mo&s;tly the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="028262_0170_0FD7F58A1E15A900">that have the word of God brought clo&s;e&s;t to them under a lively mini&s;try. Whil&s;t Peter preached, his hearers were <HI>pricked in their hearts, and cried out, men and brethren what &s;hall we do.</HI> It is the Scripture read or preached, laid open and applied, that gives the compunction and makes &s;inners in|qui&s;itive what they mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. Such as live in ignorance of the Bible, and enjoy no faith|ful preaching, &s;eldom know any thing of this: No, their <HI>goods are in peace, they are alive without the law;</HI> but when he <HI>that commands light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hines into</HI> their <HI>hearts:</HI> when the word of God which is <HI>quick and powerful</HI> pierces the con&s;cience, former delu&s;ions vani&s;h. former &s;trong holds are broken down; and there is an inward awakening, and inward light, and often a terror that may be called divine. And as this is a known pro|perty of Scripture, what it claims, and what the church of God has all along more or le&s;s found in it, it is an argument of its in&s;piration. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;hews a mighty efficacy in quickening and comforting good men. Read the hundred and nineteenth P&s;alm, and you will &s;ee how much of this David experienced in the Scriptures that were extant in his time. Hereby God quickened him, and hereby God &s;upported him, as he abundantly declares, particularly, <HI>ver.</HI> 92. <HI>Unle&s;s thy law had been my delight, I &s;hould then have peri&s;hed in mine affliction.</HI> And thou&s;ands can &s;ay the &s;ame thing. They have felt the&s;e powers of the world to come, have found a divine power breaking out of the Scripture in the &s;erious peru&s;al, or in the faithful mini&s;try of it, like lightning out of a cloud, by which their hearts have been revived and rai&s;ed, as it were, from the dead. Sometimes they have been &s;trangely ea&s;ed in their minds; freed from their darkne&s;s, burthens and fears: at another time gloriou&s;ly &s;trengthened in the inward man:
<PB N="168" REF="028262_0171_0FD7F58C133F5E40">&s;ometimes, when they have been in &s;ackcloth, un|der darkne&s;s and terror, the Scripture has cheared their drooping &s;pirits, girded them with gladne&s;s, and filled them with joy in believing. If this be fact, and I am per&s;uaded &s;ome of you can ri&s;e up and give te&s;timony to it, if the Scripture has been of this efficacy to you; if you have found it to be a word of power, of life, peace and con&s;olation; you will not ea&s;ily doubt whether it be the word of God or not. When John the Bapti&s;t &s;ent &s;ome to Chri&s;t with this que&s;tion; <HI>Art thou he that &s;hould come, or do we look for another?</HI> Chri&s;t an&s;wers, <HI>Go, and &s;hew John the things you hear and &s;ee, the blind receive their &s;ight, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dead are rai&s;ed up, and the poor have the go&s;pel preached to them.</HI> Intimating that &s;uch things as the&s;e were a &s;ufficient atte&s;tation to him, that he was the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">. The things were too glorious, and of too gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> reputation, to attend an impo&s;tor. So if the que&s;tion be, whether the Scripture be the word of God, it might be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer me|thinks, if we are able to &s;ay, that by them the &s;ouls of men are enlightened, comforted, the dead &s;pirits of men are rai&s;ed up, and made to live again, that many who were in chains and fetters are &s;et free by them, and by them the world filled with joy and gladne&s;s. A tree that bears &s;uch fruit mu&s;t have been planted by God's right hand. I will only add,</P>
<P N="4">4. That this efficacy is &s;till the &s;ame. The Scripture has the &s;ame quickening, reviving, com|forting power that ever it had. The church has lived upon it &s;ome thou&s;and years; and it has the &s;ame light, life, and con&s;olation in it that it had at fir&s;t. What the &s;tatutes of the Lord were to David, &s;o long ago, they are &s;till to all the faithful; <HI>a lamp to their feet, and a light to their paths,</HI> their rejoic|ing and their heritage forever. Nay, the more we know of the Bible, the more we meditate in the
<PB N="169" REF="028262_0172_0FD7F58D97E54770">law of God, the more we &s;hall delight in it, di&s;co|vering &s;till new and rich mines; being like its au|thor an inexhau&s;ted &s;tore-hou&s;e of all &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Well, the&s;e are the internal marks and charac|ters of the Scripture's divinity. How far they may be depended upon, and what argument they afford for the e&s;tabli&s;hing this doctrine, I de&s;igned at this time to have enquired; but that would lead me farther than your patience and attention may be prepared to follow; and therefore I &s;hall defer it to another opportunity.</P>
<P>In the mean time it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that good men have a mighty advantage above others for un|der&s;tanding and believing divine revelation. They can di&s;cern its innate excellencies and beauties. They have <HI>the witne&s;s in them&s;elves,</HI> an inward ex|perience of the glories of the Scripture; they have felt its power, ta&s;ted its &s;weetne&s;s, and therefore can &s;ay a thou&s;and things on its behalf that others can|not, and con&s;equently will not be &s;taggered with every little &s;ophi&s;tical cavil; but when attacked by gain&s;ayers, will be ready to reply, as the man born blind did to tho&s;e that were wrangling with him concerning Chri&s;t, <HI>It is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is; and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</HI> Endeavor that you may find the power and efficacy of the Scripture on your hearts, and it will very much a&s;&s;i&s;t your faith, and confirm you in it, you will never que&s;tion whence it is, nor whe|ther it be of God, &s;ince it hath opened your eyes. <HI>I will never forget thy precepts,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>for with them thou ha&s;t quickened me.</HI> The more we expe|rience of the power and u&s;efulne&s;s of the word of God, the more we &s;hall value and love it, and the more &s;teadily we &s;hall adhere to it: we &s;hall not forget it, nor be drawn off from our regard to it, becau&s;e thereby God hath quickened us, thereby he hath comforted us, re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed us,
<PB N="170" REF="028262_0173_0FD7F590467486E0">and many ways &s;aved us. And if this be the ca&s;e, if the word of God has got this hold of us, of our hearts and affections; and recommends it&s;elf to our experience, we &s;hall not be moved with every flirt of wit and little je&s;t that the author may think bri&s;k and lively. God's te&s;timony to the Scripture with|out, in his works and providence, has a glorious evidence in it, as you will afterwards hear. But his te&s;timony within comes nearer and clo&s;er to the con&s;cience, and is of mighty u&s;e to tho&s;e that have it. Endeavor for this, and for more of it; and if you do the will of Chri&s;t, and feel the authority of the Scripture in your hearts, you &s;hall know of his doctrine, whether it be of God.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>

<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e words, I laid before you the internal marks and characters of the di|vine in&s;piration of the holy Scriptures. Some call them, the &s;elf-evidencing light thereof, and lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s upon them, that they not only think all other arguments in&s;ufficient without this, but that this is &s;ufficient without them, and exclu&s;ive of them all. There are, they think, tho&s;e characters and impre&s;&s;ions of divinity upon the Scriptures that it manife&s;ts it&s;elf by its own light, to be from God. <Q>The authority of God, the &s;upreme Lord of all, &s;aith a learned divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s &s;elf-evidencing light of the Scripture.</NOTE> &s;peaking in and by the penmen of Scripture, evidenced &s;ingly in, and by Scripture it&s;elf, is the &s;ole bottom and foun|dation or formal rea&s;on of our a&s;&s;enting to the&s;e Scriptures as his word, and &s;ubmitting our hearts and con&s;ciences to them. He adds, God's voice to the penmen of Scripture was accompanied with its own evidence, which gave a&s;&s;urance to
<PB N="172" REF="028262_0175_0FD7F592D41CC9D8">them; and God &s;peaking by them, or their writing to us; his word is accompanied with its own evidence, and gives a&s;&s;urance to us, his authority and veracity did, and do, in the one and the other &s;ufficiently manife&s;t them&s;elves. And again, as God in the creation of the world, and all things, hath &s;o made and framed them, hath left &s;uch characters of his eternal power and wi&s;dom on them, filled with &s;uch evidence of their author, that without any other te&s;timony from him&s;elf or any el&s;e, under the naked con|&s;ideration of what they are, they declare their Creator. So in the giving out his word, he hath by his &s;pirit implanted in it, and impre&s;&s;ed on it &s;uch characters of his goodne&s;s, power, wi&s;dom and holine&s;s, of his love to mankind, truth and faithfulne&s;s, with all the re&s;t of his glorious ex|cellencies and perfections, that at all times, and in all places, where the expan&s;ion of Scripture is &s;tretched out over men by his providence; with|out any other witne&s;s or te&s;timony given there|unto, it declareth it&s;elf to be his, and makes good its authority from him. So that the refu&s;al of it upon its own evidence, brings unavoidable condemnation on the &s;ouls of men. This is di|vine te&s;timony, accompanying the true voice of God, evidencing it&s;elf, and a&s;certaining the &s;oul beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take. Wherever the Scripture is truly received, as the word of God, it is received upon the evidence of that light it hath in it&s;elf; it is all one by what means, by what hands, whether of a child, or of a church, by tradition, accident, or &s;pecial providence, the Scripture comes to us; come how it will it hath its authority in it&s;elf by being the word of God, and hath its power of manife&s;ting it&s;elf &s;o to be from its own innate light.</Q> A great deal more in the like &s;train occurs in the &s;ame learned wri|ter.
<PB N="173" REF="028262_0176_0FD7F598931813A8">He particularly hints wherein the power and authority of the Scripture con&s;i&s;ts, by which it proves it&s;elf to be divine. As its diving into the hearts, con&s;ciences, and &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the minds of men; its judging and &s;entencing them in them|&s;elves; its convictions, terrors, conque&s;ts, and kil|ling of men; its converting, building, making wi&s;e, holy and obedient; its admini&s;tring con&s;ola|tions in every condition, and the like. The&s;e he accounts &s;uch an impre&s;s of God on the Scripture, that they may be looked upon as &s;o many infallible &s;igns, di&s;tingui&s;hing it from the product of any creature. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e another ingenious writer, <Q>the Scripture, &s;ays he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polhill's Precious Faith, p. 35.</NOTE>, appears in divine and heavenly characters, and by the&s;e it bears witne&s;s to it&s;elf that it is the word of God.</Q> So Calvin putting the que&s;tion how we &s;hall be per|&s;uaded it comes from God? an&s;wers, it is the &s;ame thing as to a&s;k, how we can di&s;tingui&s;h light from darkne&s;s. And adds, another author of con&s;idera|ble name, I mean bi&s;hop Leighton,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sermons, p. 85.</NOTE> <Q>They are little ver&s;ed in the holy Scripture that know not that it is frequently called light, and they are &s;en&s;ele&s;s that know not that light is &s;een and known by it&s;elf. <HI>If our go&s;pel be hid,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>it is hid to them that peri&s;h;</HI> the God of the world having blinded their minds again&s;t the <HI>light of the glorious go&s;pel.</HI> No wonder if &s;uch &s;tand in need of a te&s;timony. A blind man knows not that it is light at noon day, but by report; but to tho&s;e that have eyes, light is &s;een by it&s;elf.</Q> I mention the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages more par|ticularly, that I may give you the argument they lay &s;o great weight upon in its full &s;trength, as re|pre&s;ented in their own words. The&s;e learned men
<PB N="174" REF="028262_0177_0FD7F59B2A2F60A0">you &s;ee &s;uppo&s;e the Scripture to bring with it its own proof; and its internal characters, that impre&s;s it has upon it of the maje&s;ty and authority, purity, wi&s;dom and holine&s;s of God, they &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ort of a divine light, and requires only open eyes to di&s;|cern it. Now before I di&s;mi&s;s this argument I &s;hall make a few remarks upon it; in which I mean not to &s;et a&s;ide or weaken it, but guard it. No doubt there is a great deal in the doctrine of Scrip|ture to recommend it to us, as a revelation from God. It has internal characters, that &s;hew its ex|cellency, and imply divinity. But whether the notion of &s;elf-evidencing light, as you have heard it &s;tated, be not carried too far may be que&s;tioned. I &s;hall briefly propo&s;e my thoughts concerning it in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. It mu&s;t not be a&s;&s;erted, that the Scripture ap|pears to all men with this &s;elf-evidencing light. They, that in&s;i&s;t mo&s;t upon it, grant that the &s;pe|cial illumination of the &s;pirit is nece&s;&s;ary to our di&s;cerning the evidence. The eyes of our minds mu&s;t be opened or we &s;hall not &s;ee this light, how clear and &s;trong &s;oever. So that the argument from hence is rather for the confirmation of good men, than the conviction of all. Though the &s;un &s;hines with the utmo&s;t brightne&s;s, it cannot enlight|en tho&s;e that want eyes. And the ca&s;e is allowed to be the &s;ame, with reference to the Scripture's internal light and evidence. Con&s;equently, this argument cannot be of general u&s;e. And yet I que&s;tion not the Scripture may be proved, not only to be true, but to be in&s;pired even to the convic|tion of carnal men, that have only u&s;e of their ra|tional faculties, without &s;pecial grace and illumin|ation. Not that they can receive it, or indeed any other point or particular doctrine of religion with a divine faith; but it may be demon&s;trated by &s;trong arguments, the force of which they may di&s;|cern,
<PB N="175" REF="028262_0178_0FD7F59D561C1478">even before they receive the &s;pirit of illu|mination. How far they may di&s;cern the internal marks of its divinity, I cannot digre&s;s to enquire. No doubt they may di&s;cover much of the beauty and excellency of the Scripture, and own it. It would be pre&s;umptuous, I am afraid, to affirm, that all who have wrote with great learning in defence of the Bible, and particularly have with great &s;kill di&s;played the internal excellency of its doctrine were &s;anctified and good men. However, whether this be granted, or not, as the &s;elf-evidencing light, in the judgment of tho&s;e authors I have mentioned, &s;hines only to them that have the illumination of the &s;pirit, and no que&s;tion it &s;hines mo&s;t eminently to them, it mu&s;t not be looked upon as an argument proper to convince every one. Whatever light there is in the Scripture, or how much &s;oever it partakes of the nature of light, it cannot enlighten them that have not eyes, or want the faculty of di&s;cerning. And yet even the&s;e are bound to re|ceive the Scripture, and are capable of apprehend|ing &s;ufficient rea&s;on and evidence upon which they ought to believe it.</P>
<P N="2">2. When it is &s;aid the Scripture is &s;elf-evident, it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, that the evidence is as ea&s;y and obvious as in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e propo&s;iti|ons we call &s;elf evident; as that two and three make five, or that the whole is greater than a part. Even good men, notwith&s;tanding their illumination from above, need a great deal of rea&s;oning, and con&s;ideration, and the help of much and long ex|perience before they can &s;atisfactorily di&s;cern the internal light of the Scripture; &s;o di&s;cern it as to make it an argument of the divinity thereof. We mu&s;t not therefore apply the metaphor of light, to which the Scripture is compared, too &s;trictly; as if every &s;piritual and good man, that opens the Bible, might &s;ee characters of divine in&s;piration there, as
<PB N="176" REF="028262_0179_0FD7F5A016CDEFB8">plainly as he can &s;ee when the &s;un &s;hines. Tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, that import any thing of this kind, I cannot think &s;ufficiently guarded.</P>
<P N="3">3. I apprehend this &s;elf-evidencing light doth not run through the whole Bible, and appear in every part alike. And I know not but I might &s;ay it doth not &s;ufficiently appear at all in &s;ome parts of it. If the light and evidence be placed in the a&s;&s;er|tions of Scripture, that it is from God, this cannot be admitted as evidence enough that it is &s;o; be|cau&s;e other books not in&s;pired, as the Alcoran for in&s;tance, a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame. And be&s;ides there are &s;ome parts of Scripture that do not a&s;&s;ert this. If the impre&s;s of God thereon be made the &s;elf-evi|dencing light, I am afraid it will be difficult to di&s;|cern this in every book and chapter of the Bible, as in the Kings and Chronicles; and it will be no le&s;s difficult for any one, by this impre&s;s appearing in the book it&s;elf, to pronounce that the Proverbs is the word of God, and not the book of wi&s;dom, that Eccle&s;ia&s;tes is divinely in&s;pired, and not Eccle&s;i|a&s;ticus. I &s;ubjoin,</P>
<P N="4">4. That this internal evidence of the in&s;piration of Scripture re&s;ults from the con&s;titution and frame of the Bible in general; from the doctrines and hi&s;tory of it, the excellency of its matter and &s;tyle. Take the Bible together, con&s;ider it in its whole plan and de&s;ign; and it has glorious characters of divinity upon it. Its doctrines, laws and hi&s;tories, have &s;omething &s;o great, &s;o pure and &s;piritual in them; it has &s;uch marks of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; it is &s;o wonderfully &s;uited to the nece&s;&s;ities and oc|ca&s;ions of &s;inful men, and &s;o well fitted every way to &s;ub&s;erve the profe&s;&s;ed end of &s;uch a revelation, that one may conclude it to be a revelation from God, and above human contrivance. And this will appear with greater force and conviction to tho&s;e that have lived under the impre&s;&s;ion of it, and
<PB N="177" REF="028262_0180_0FD7F5A0442C5FE8">have long experienced its power, and ta&s;ted its comforts.</P>
<P N="5">5. Though this be a good confirming argument of the divinity of the Bible, we ought not, I think to lay the main &s;tre&s;s here, much le&s;s to make it the only argument. We find our Lord appeals to other evidence, namely, that of his miraculous works; <HI>I have greater witne&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>than that of John; for the works, which my father hath given me to fini&s;h, the &s;ame works that I do, bear witne&s;s of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me.</HI> And again, <HI>the works I do in my Father's name, they bear witne&s;s of me.</HI> And, <HI>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works.</HI> You &s;ee he doth not demand their a&s;&s;ent and faith upon his own te&s;timony, or the te&s;timony of John, but produces his works as his credentials. The Scripture is a doctrine worthy of God, and appears in its own innate light and excellency worthy of our acceptation. But, as God has been plea&s;ed to recommend it by many other arguments be&s;ides his own image and impre&s;s thereupon, the&s;e ought not to be neglected. Chri&s;t brings in his works among the evidences of his divine mi&s;&s;ion: and certainly whatever tends to prove, that God &s;ent the writers of the <HI>Bible,</HI> &s;hould be admitted on their behalf, and as a plea for their in&s;piration. Nor can I think it any &s;ervice to the cau&s;e, to lay all the weight upon a &s;ingle argument, rejecting others that may have equal, if not &s;uperior force. Once more,</P>
<P N="6">6. It mu&s;t however be allowed, that the internal excellency, or what &s;ome call it, &s;elf evidencing light, is at lea&s;t a &s;trong motive of its credibility. I do not &s;ay, it is no more, for I think the Scrip|ture Revelation, con&s;idered in the whole of it, is too &s;ublime and divine, has too many characters of wi&s;|dom, holine&s;s, &amp;c. to own any author, but God. So that it is more than a motive of credibility.
<PB N="178" REF="028262_0181_0FD7F5A232F1F248">In the mean time, it is that in a very high degree. Indeed no external arguments of the divinity of the Bible could conclude and determine any rea|&s;onable creature's belief of it, as from God, was it not a revelation every way worthy of him. It is a pertinent pa&s;&s;age to our purpo&s;e of the great Chillingworth <Q>I profe&s;s, &s;ays he, if the doctrine of Scripture did not appear as good, and as fit to come from God, the fountain of goodne&s;s, as the miracles by which it was confirmed were great, I &s;hould want one main pillar of my faith, and for want of it, I fear, I &s;hould be much &s;taggered.</Q> In &s;hort, there is nothing a chri&s;|tian can re&s;t in with more &s;atisfaction, touching the divine in&s;piration of the Bible, than this, that he finds it &s;peaks to him in a way becoming God, commands with an authority becoming God, &s;earches the heart and con&s;cience with light and force becoming God, directs with a wi&s;dom and knowledge God-like, &s;upports, quickens, and com|forts in a manner that plainly &s;hews a divine in|fluence attends it.</P>
<P>But thus much for the third general argument, the internal characters of the Scripture's divinity; which I have &s;tayed the longer upon, becau&s;e I ap|prehended &s;ome difficulty in it; whether I have cleared it or not, I &s;hall not fay. I have however offered what occurred, at pre&s;ent, mo&s;t proper for that purpo&s;e. I proceed now to another argument.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The divine in&s;piration of the Scripture may be argued from &s;ome external marks and characters, &s;ome outward circum&s;tances, and from the provi|dence of God eminently intere&s;ting it&s;elf in behalf thereof: as the antiquity of it, the pre&s;ervation of it through &s;o many ages, its &s;urpri&s;ing accompli&s;h|ment in all the parts of it, and the like.</P>
<P N="1">1. The antiquity of it. I am far from thinking this, one of the be&s;t of our arguments. But as it
<PB N="179" REF="028262_0182_0FD7F5AE4E553850">is generally produced in favor of this cau&s;e, I do not think fit wholly to neglect it; though I &s;hall but touch it briefly. It is agreed, I think however I am &s;atisfied nothing tolerable can be offered again&s;t it, that the Scriptures, I mean part of them, are the mo&s;t ancient writings of any in the world. Ju&s;tin Martyr, a learned father, who lived in the &s;econd century, within about one hundred and thirty years after Chri&s;t, as &s;ome compute, in his exhortation to the Greeks, proves by comparing the times of all human writers, poets, philo&s;ophers, hi&s;torians, and lawgivers, the mo&s;t celebrated for their antiquity, that the laws of Mo&s;es and his writings were long before any of them. And at the &s;ame time &s;hews, that whatever is excellent in any of them, as Orpheus, Homer, Solon, Pythago|ras, or Plato, they derived from Mo&s;es, lighting their candles at his lamp. Eu&s;ebius, another pri|mitive writer, evidences at large the &s;uperior an|tiquity of Mo&s;es, and concludes, that Mo&s;es is found to be more ancient, even than all the gods and heroes of the Greeks. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e Tertullian and others. And indeed, there are none of the heathen authors that can vie with Mo&s;es in this re&s;pect. He begins his hi&s;tory and account of things, from the creation, and continues it through the fir&s;t two thou&s;and years of the world, and more. And though we have no written re|cords of the affairs of the patriarchs before the time that Mo&s;es wrote, yet it is certain his book is of earlier date than any other. His Pentateuch was extant before Thales, Hermes, Sanchoniatho, Homer, or any of the famous pagan antiquaries were heard of, indeed before they had a being; which Tertullian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole pa&s;&s;age of Tertullian being &s;o very remarkable and full to the purpo&s;e it cannot be ami&s;s to in&s;ert it here; <Q>Be|fore any of your public monuments and In&s;criptions, &s;ays he, before any of your forms of government, before the olde&s;t of your books, the original of many nations, the foundation of ma|ny famous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ities, and mo&s;t ancient hi&s;torians; yea, before the invention of letters; and, as if I had hitherto &s;aid but little, be|fore the very being of your gods, your temples, oracles, and &s;acrif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces, were the writings of one of our prophets extant, which are the treafury of the Jewi&s;h religion, and by con&s;equence of the Chri&s;tian. If you have heard of Mo&s;es the prophet, I will tell you his age, he was co-temporary with Ina|chus the fir&s;t king of the Argives, older by three hundred nine|ty-three years than Danaus the olde&s;t in your hi&s;tories. About a thou&s;and years before the de&s;truction of Troy, or, as others reckon, about five hundred years before Homer; the re&s;t of the prophets, though later than Mo&s;es, yet the late&s;t of them fall in with &s;ome of your Sages, lawgivers and hi&s;torians.</Q>&mdash; Nor did he &s;ay &s;o without rea&s;on, &s;ince I&s;aiah, Ho&s;ea, and other of the prophets lived at the time when the Greeks fir&s;t began their Olympiads, before Rome was built; and the very late&s;t of the Old Te&s;tament writers flouri&s;hed before Socrates. To which I may add, that as the other two fathers here mentioned, Ju&s;tin Martyr and Eu&s;ebius, to &s;ay nothing of Clemens Alexandrinus, Cyril, St. Au&s;tin, &amp;c. who urge the &s;ame argument, in&s;i&s;t more at large upon the &s;ubject, &s;o they fully prove Mo&s;es of much greater an|tiquity than the mo&s;t ancient pagan authors. And indeed, this is univer&s;ally owned not only by Jews and Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o by heathens them&s;elves. Even Porphyry, one of the mo&s;t learned and &s;hrewd adver&s;aries chri&s;tianity ever had, was forced to allow him older than his favorite Sanchoniatho, whom yet he places before the Trojan war.</NOTE> enlarges upon, and thereby
<PB N="180" REF="028262_0183_0FD7F5AF8D11B7E8">triumphs over the gentiles; &s;hewing them their religion was but a novel up&s;tart thing compared with that of the chri&s;tians. Mo&s;es, he tells them, lived &s;ome hundred of years before the ruins of Troy; that all the re&s;t of the prophets &s;ucceeded Mo&s;es, and yet &s;ome of the la&s;t of them were of the &s;ame age with their fir&s;t wife men, lawgivers, and hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, what evidence doth this afford of the divinity, or in&s;piration of the Bible? I an&s;wer, as mankind needed a revelation from God, imme|diately upon his apo&s;tacy, and had rea&s;on to hope
<PB N="181" REF="028262_0184_0FD7F5B0E7B21818">for &s;uch a favor, from the divine mercy and good|ne&s;s; and as the Bible is the mo&s;t ancient revela|tion, beginning with man's nece&s;&s;ities, and provi|ding a &s;uitable remedy for them, it is mo&s;t likely to be from God. Not to &s;ay, that antiquity has al|ways claimed a &s;ort of veneration, men agree by common con&s;ent, to ri&s;e up before the hoary head thereof. Hence Tertullian pleads with the gen|tiles, that as it was matter of religion and con&s;ci|ence to give credit to things according to their age and antiquity; therefore the Chri&s;tian religion, having marks of the highe&s;t antiquity, de&s;erved their greate&s;t honor, and they ought accordingly to reverence it. But what I think of the greate&s;t weight here, is, that the Bible being the mo&s;t anci|ent book in the world, has gone through a cour&s;e of the longe&s;t examinations. It has, &s;ome of it, bore the te&s;t of many thou&s;and years, and has &s;tood its ground, after the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t critical trial.</P>
<P>Now had it been fal&s;e, it is not to be imagined it would have e&s;caped without di&s;covery. After it has undergone the &s;crutiny of &s;o many ages, of &s;o many thou&s;ands and millions of per&s;ons, both of friends and enemies, from one generation to another, one cannot rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect it; nor can we think it con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of God, his love of truth and hatred of fal&s;|hood, and his regard to mankind, to &s;uffer a cheat to reign and triumph &s;o long in full glory and repu|tation. No, had it been a cunningly devi&s;ed fable, he would &s;urely have interpo&s;ed in his providence and have defeated it. As time is a con&s;umer of things, &s;o it is a touch&s;tone to di&s;cover what they are. A cheat may pa&s;s for a while, but it was never known that a cheat, &s;uch a one as the Bible mu&s;t be, if it be a cheat, ever pa&s;&s;ed long without di&s;|grace. So that it is really a probable argument, and I carry it no farther, whatever others have
<PB N="182" REF="028262_0185_0FD7F5B266064890">done, that as the Bible is the mo&s;t ancient book, it is a divine book.</P>
<P>If any object, this only &s;peaks for the writings of Mo&s;es. I an&s;wer, it is granted. But then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that Mo&s;es' books contain the &s;ub|&s;tance of the re&s;t. The apo&s;tle tells us, the go&s;pel was preached to Abraham. It had an edition then. We find in the Pentateuch the lineaments, and a more imperfect draught of the whole Bible. And be&s;ides, it has been &s;hewn before, that the &s;everal parts of the Scriptures give te&s;timony to one ano|ther. So that what confirms and proves one di|vine, derives a &s;ort of an Authority to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The pre&s;ervation of the Bible through &s;o many ages is another circum&s;tance, that may be urged to prove the &s;ame thing. If it had not been of God, we cannot think he would have concerned him&s;elf &s;o much about it, and employed his provi|dence for its &s;ecurity all along, as we are a&s;&s;ured he has done. That we have the &s;everal in&s;pired books brought down to us &s;afe and entire, in the main, I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew. At pre&s;ent, I &s;up|po&s;e this to be fact, and may, I think, ground an argument upon it in favor of the Bible.</P>
<P>Several things might be offered to illu&s;trate this; as, that it is the mo&s;t ancient book, and &s;o has had the more time to decay and peri&s;h in. It has gone through a longer &s;tate of trial, as I may &s;ay, and has &s;tood expo&s;ed to all ca&s;ualties and hazards for more ages than any book be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Farther, the &s;ubject of it would create it more enemies. Some books &s;o little concern mankind, they treat about &s;uch mere amu&s;ements, matters of no importance, or at be&s;t little &s;peculations; that they are not like to rai&s;e the enmity of the world again&s;t them. Indeed mens carele&s;ne&s;s a|bout things that de&s;erve no care, may &s;uffer them to peri&s;h; but their &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;ts, or real en|mity
<PB N="183" REF="028262_0186_0FD7F5B45B5BC8C0">will never ri&s;e up again&s;t them to de&s;troy them. Whereas the <HI>Bible</HI> is of a different con|&s;ideration. It treats of higher important things, to which the pa&s;&s;ions and corruptions of men &s;tand in a direct oppo&s;ition. It is a &s;tanding record for God, and again&s;t Satan and his kingdom; a con&s;tant curb and check to vicious men in their pur&s;uits, and &s;ometimes a terror to them. And con&s;equently, &s;uch a book would have many ene|mies that would be glad to get rid of it; to ruin its reputation, and de&s;troy its very being, if they could.</P>
<P>I add, this has actually been the ca&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cripture. Not only bad men have always hated it, but &s;ome of its enemies have appeared again&s;t it with a power equal to their malice. The attempts of <HI>Antiochus Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phanes</HI> under the Old Te&s;tament, and of Diocle&s;ian under the New, to this purpo&s;e, are known. The former, when he had &s;acked Jeru&s;alem, profaned their temple, and made the daily &s;acrifice to cea&s;e, as Daniel prophe&s;ied of him; made diligent &s;earch for the law; burnt all the copies of it he could find, and threatened the &s;evere&s;t torments to tho&s;e who &s;hould conceal it. And the very &s;ame thing did Diocle&s;ian, &s;o fa|mous, or rather infamous, for his rage again&s;t chri&s;tians, and who triumphed in his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uc|ce&s;s. After the mo&s;t barbarous havoc of them, he put forth an edict commanding the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to bring in their <HI>Bibles</HI> to be burnt and de&s;troyed: which multitudes out of fear complied with, and thence had the reproachful name of Traditores, tho&s;e that delivered up their <HI>Bibles,</HI> and in ca&s;e of fai|lure, he threatened all &s;orts of tortures and death. Well, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and all other a&s;&s;aults, notwith&s;tanding the enmity and malice of wicked men and devils again&s;t the Scripture, it has been pre&s;erved pure and uncorrupt, in the main, to this
<PB N="184" REF="028262_0187_0FD7F5B60970F248">day. We have the &s;ame law God delivered to Mo&s;es on mount Sinai, the &s;ame &s;tatutes and judg|ments he gave to I&s;rael, we have the true hi&s;tory left by the immediate followers of the Lord Je&s;us, and tho&s;e &s;acred books that contain the genuine records of their doctrine. The&s;e God has pre&s;erv|ed to us, and lodged in our hands, by a care and &s;overeignty of providence, that one need not &s;cru|ple to call divine. They have been often in dan|ger,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greate&s;t danger they were ever in of being lo&s;t, was in the days of king Jo&s;iah, if tho&s;e learned men are in the right who think there was only one copy of the law of Mo&s;es then left, which Hilkiah the prie&s;t ca&s;ually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">d in the temple, 2 Kings xxii. 8. But there are others to when it &s;eems much more probable, that the book there &s;poken of, was either the Autograph of Mo&s;es, that authentic copy that was expre&s;sly ordered to be laid up and kept by the &s;ide of the ark in the mo&s;t holy place, Deut. xxxi. 26. or el&s;e &s;ome other &s;acred copy u&s;ed in the &s;ervice of the temple and pre&s;erved there, like as was afterwards done in the &s;econd temple, where we are told that copy was kept, which Titus carried in triumph to Rome. Jo&s;eph. de Bell. Judaic. L. vii. cap 24.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes almo&s;t bundled up and brought to the funeral pile. The implacable and avowed enemies of religion, who at once had all human power and terror in their hands, have decreed their extirpation, and accordingly &s;et them&s;elves to accompli&s;h it. But God has defeat|ed all their de&s;igns; &s;till the Bible exi&s;ts and is triumphant, and, I doubt not, will as long as there is a church in the world, that is, till the end of time, and con&s;ummation of all things.</P>
<P>Now hence, I think, one might form an argu|ment that amounts to a demon&s;tration of a moral kind. God's providence in pre&s;erving the Bible is a public &s;ignification that he owns it. Such have been its hazards, that it could never have been pre&s;erved, had not God undertaken its defence. And &s;uch is the ju&s;tice, truth, holine&s;s, and good|ne&s;s of God, that he would never have e&s;pou&s;ed
<PB N="185" REF="028262_0188_0FD7F5B6DB7F5A38">it in the manner he has done, had it been a for|gery, and not from him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another particular, under the general head of external marks and characters of the divinity of Scripture, is the wonderful accompli&s;hment of it in all the circum&s;tances thereof. I &s;ay, in all the circum&s;tances of it; which I que&s;tion not is true, though we may not be able fully to make this out. We may want capacities &s;ometimes to under&s;tand the text, and often to expound the pro|vidence that is an exact accompli&s;hment of it; and &s;o cannot di&s;cern the harmony between the one and the other: which yet is real and certain, and reaches even to very minute and little things, had we penetration enough to di&s;cover it. Howe|ver, notwith&s;tanding our defects here, &s;o much is evident to a diligent ob&s;erver, as is &s;ufficient to give this argument its due force. The Bible has been fulfilled in all ages, from the beginning of the world to this day. It has been &s;o in many in&s;tances as mu&s;t appear to the &s;atisfaction of all, that will allow them&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the&s;e matters, and we have rea&s;on to conclude, it is &s;o univer|&s;ally.</P>
<P>I &s;hall a little expatiate on this head; and let you &s;ee wherein the Scripture is fulfilled, and then make a few remarks, &s;hewing you how the accom|pli&s;hment thereof proves its divinity. Now the Scripture has been fulfilled,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the natural and material world. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the moral world or world of mankind.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. It has been fulfilled in the natural or material world. The account the Bible gives us of the heavens and the earth, &s;o far as they fall under our ob&s;ervation, has been an&s;wered in providence through all generations hitherto. I &s;hall mention a few particulars out of many.</P>
<P N="1">1. We find, according to Scripture, the ground
<PB N="186" REF="028262_0189_0FD7F5BAA4629B10">laid under a cur&s;e upon man's apo&s;tacy, <HI>And unto Adam he &s;aid, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t harkened unto the voice of thy wi&s;e, and ha&s;t eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, &s;aying, thou &s;halt not eat of it: cur&s;ed is the ground for thy &s;ake; in &s;orrow &s;halt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns al&s;o and thi&s;tles &s;hall it bring forth unto thee: in the &s;weat of thy face &s;hall thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.</HI> This the Scripture tells us &s;hould be the future &s;tate of the earth, and we have the experi|ence of &s;everal thou&s;and years atte&s;ting the truth of it. Had not mankind &s;inned, we may ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;e the earth would have been more fertile, and would have yielded the conveniencies of life with le&s;s labour and pains. But as a puni&s;hment of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion it was doomed to a &s;ort of &s;terility, or barrenne&s;s. Thorns and thi&s;tles are its &s;ponta|neous production. It brings forth the&s;e of its own accord. But if man will enjoy its more u&s;eful fruits, it mu&s;t be with greater expence than was nece&s;&s;ary heretofore. He mu&s;t labor in cultivating it, and eat thereof in the &s;weat of his face. Thus the Bible intimates it &s;hould be, that the earth would undergo a change for the wor&s;e in this re&s;|pect; being cur&s;ed for man's &s;ake. And thus all have found it through every age &s;ince.</P>
<P N="2">2. When mankind had lived upon the earth for fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred years, and their &s;ins had provoked the wrath and vengeance of heaven again&s;t them, the Scripture foretells the amazing judgment of an univer&s;al deluge, or flood, which God would bring upon them for their wickedne&s;s. The denunciation of this judgment you have, Gen, vi. 5, 6, 7, 13, 17. That it was fulfilled, and how, you read in the next chapter. I will only ob&s;erve, that the fact that there was a general deluge, at the time a&s;&s;igned by Mo&s;es, is not only affirmed in the Bible, and referred to over and over again there,
<PB N="187" REF="028262_0190_0FD7F5BB511CDFE8">both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, but we have the concurrence of the mo&s;t ancient heathen wri|ters to the &s;ame truth. One of them, of great re|putation, tells us, that O&s;iris, or Noah, went into the ark on the &s;eventeenth day of the Egyptian month Athyr, when the &s;un pa&s;&s;es the &s;ign Scorpio, which is the very &s;ame day mentioned by Mo&s;es, the &s;eventeenth day of the &s;econd month, as &s;ome have &s;hewn from a&s;tronomical calculations. Nor have we only full te&s;timony for the fact; but a kind of demon&s;tration of it from the numerous &s;hells of fi&s;hes, from plants, trees, and other remains of the antideluvian world; which are to this day found buried in the bowels of the earth; and, I do not think, can be &s;o rationally accounted for, as upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a general deluge.</P>
<P>Now if it be con&s;idered, that this was threatened above a hundred years before it came to pa&s;s, when there were no tokens and intimations of it in na|ture: that Noah, that preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, was employed to give warning of it all that while, and that the judgment was executed in the very manner, and at the very time foretold; we may, I think, place this among tho&s;e remarkable provi|dences that confirm the truth and divinity of the Scripture. None but the great Author of nature could bring about &s;uch an event, and none but he could predict and in&s;ure it. He alone could do the thing, and he only could foretell it.</P>
<P N="3">3. After this dreadful and amazing judgment had taken place, God was plea&s;ed to give a &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance to mankind, that he would not again de&s;|troy them in &s;uch a manner, and inflict the like ca|lamity of an univer&s;al deluge; and as a token and pledge of his promi&s;e he tells them he would &s;et his bow in the heavens. <HI>I will remember,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>my convenant which is between me, and you, and every
<PB N="188" REF="028262_0191_0FD7F5C548745268">living creature of all fle&s;h: and the waters &s;hall no more become a flood to de&s;troy all fle&s;h. And the how &s;hall be in the could; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everla&s;ting covenant between God, and every living creature that is upon the earth.</HI> This was God's promi&s;e to the world after the flood, and one may ob&s;erve it carries an air of &s;overeignty and authority in it, that &s;eems to intimate it could come from none but God; could not be the fiction of Mo&s;es, or any impo&s;tor, in&s;erted as an embel|li&s;hment in his hi&s;tory. For who but the great Sovereign and Lord of nature, that had &s;pared a very &s;inful world for above &s;ixteen hundred years, and ju&s;t now de&s;troyed it, could pa&s;s an act of in|demnity, and grant a &s;ecurity again&s;t the like judg|ment for all future time; and not only &s;o, but place the rain-bow in the clouds, as a pledge of his faith|fulne&s;s in this in&s;tance: a token, a federal token between God and man, that the world &s;hould never more peri&s;h by water.</P>
<P>This is the record of Scripture, and every ge|neration &s;ince, for more than four thou&s;and years, has &s;een the accompli&s;hment of it in both the parts, <HI>viz.</HI> a freedom from an univer&s;al flood, and the frequent appearance of the rain-bow: if it be &s;aid, the rain-bow is no new thing, it appeared as much before the flood, as &s;ince, and could not but ap|pear, if they had rain, it proceeding from natural cau&s;es, and being the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of them. I an&s;wer, that at lea&s;t it was appointed for a new &s;er|vice and purpo&s;e after the flood. If it appeared in the clouds before, it was not as a &s;ign of God's co|venant and promi&s;e till afterwards. But, I an&s;wer further, that it does not appear probable to me, there ever was a rain-bow before the flood. The manner of introducing it, <HI>behold I do &s;et my bow in the clouds,</HI> and the end it was to &s;erve for, <HI>it &s;hall be for a token of the covenant between me and the
<PB N="189" REF="028262_0192_0FD7F5C77076EBE0">earth.</HI> This I think implies, it had not been &s;een in the clouds before, and that it was then fir&s;t, and ever after upon occa&s;ion, to appear as a pledge to mankind, that God would make good his promi&s;e. Nor are the late di&s;coveries in philo&s;ophy concern|ing the rainbow, any &s;ufficient objection again&s;t this. We need only &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;tate of the air before the flood was different from what it is at pre&s;ent, and then the objection is removed. And that it might be &s;o, is not at all improbable; and that it actually was &s;o, I have the authority of &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers of no little reputation for &s;kill in the&s;e matters. One<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whi&s;ton's Scripture Prophecies, p. 103.</NOTE> of them &s;peaking of the &s;ubject, has the&s;e words. <Q>Who, but the great governor and di&s;po&s;er of all the works of nature, could &s;o alter the con&s;titution of the air after the deluge, that whereas all the former generations had never &s;een nor heard of &s;uch a thing as the rain-bow, the future &s;hould never be without that glorious &s;ignal of divine goodne&s;s, and in&s;tance of the divine power.</Q> He &s;uppo&s;es, that the rain|bow is a new appearance, that it is a &s;pecial work of the divine power and providence, and that to produce it God changed the &s;tate of the air. And if this be the ca&s;e, as I reckon probable enough, that the bow is a new phaenomenon, never &s;een before the flood, it was the fitter when it appeared, to be a &s;ign of God's covenant, and a confirmation of his promi&s;e. And the con&s;tant appearance of it now, is a glorious in&s;tance of the truth of the Scrip|ture. We &s;hould accordingly improve it, and when we behold the bow in the clouds; &s;uch a reflection as this cannot be impertinent. How faithful is God in all his promi&s;es! How certain, how divine the record he has given of him&s;elf in his word! This God promi&s;ed before any &s;uch thing was
<PB N="190" REF="028262_0193_0FD7F5C8ECFEC4B0">known in the world; and every age has &s;een the performance. Thus true is the word of God, and thus &s;ure are his promi&s;es. I may &s;ubjoin, as what is nearly connected with this head.</P>
<P N="4">4. The a&s;&s;urance the Scripture gives us of a re|gular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of day and night, and of the vari|ous &s;ea&s;ons of the year. This was promi&s;ed imme|diately after Noah came out of the ark, and had offered &s;acrifice to his great pre&s;erver, <HI>while the earth remaineth, &s;eed-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime and harve&s;t, cold and heat, &s;ummer and winter, and day and night &s;hall not cea&s;e,</HI> that is, there &s;hall be no &s;uch confu&s;ion of things as during the late cata&s;trophe and de&s;olation oc|ca&s;ioned, by the deluge, but he will pre&s;erve nature in its regular cour&s;e to the end of time. This I take to be the import of that promi&s;e or prophecy, and every age &s;ince has had the comfortable expe|rience of the accompli&s;hment of it to the pre&s;ent day, and we may depend upon it, it &s;hall always be accompli&s;hed, even till that period the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, <HI>when the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements melt with fervent heat, the earth al&s;o and the works therein &s;hall be burnt up.</HI></P>
<P>This account and repre&s;entation that the Scrip|ture gives of the natural world, &s;ome great and im|portant phaenomena and events therein: To which much more might be added to the like purpo&s;e did I apprehend the di&s;cour&s;e would be acceptable and u&s;eful to the auditory; this account, I &s;ay, glori|ou&s;ly confirms the truth of Scripture, and eviden|ces it mu&s;t have a divine original. Had the wri|ters thereof invented their own materials, they would not have drawn &s;uch a &s;cheme of things, and &s;o boldly have pronounced concerning future events of providence, wholly out of their power and pro&s;pect, about which they could have no cer|tainty them&s;elves, nor give &s;ecurity to others. In the next place,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="191" REF="028262_0194_0FD7F5CA56D2ED10">
2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in the mo|ral world, or the world of mankind. The account it has given of men and their affairs, has been veri|fied and an&s;wered with great exactne&s;s through every age, &s;o as to make a beautiful harmony be|tween the word of God and providence. It would be no &s;mall plea&s;ure to contemplate and view this, as far as our knowledge and ob&s;ervation can carry us. But I &s;hall re&s;train my&s;elf, and only offer a few hints. The Scripture has been and is fulfilled in &s;everal in&s;tances, that concern mankind in ge|neral. It has been fulfilled in &s;ome &s;pecial in&s;tan|ces towards particular families, nations, and people, towards particular per&s;ons, and towards the two different &s;orts, in the grand divi&s;ion of mankind, bad men and good men.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been, and continues to be fulfilled in &s;everal in&s;tances that concern mankind in general; as the univer&s;al taint and defilement of nature. This the Bible mentions as fact. <HI>God made man up|right, but he found out many inventions.</HI> And it gives an account of the occa&s;ion and ri&s;e of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the apo&s;tacy of our fir&s;t parents; by which the hu|man nature was corrupted in the fountain of it. That this has been fulfilled, every man in the world has had experience, more or le&s;s, according to his time in the world, and his &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding of the&s;e matters. <HI>This only have I found,</HI> &s;ays So|lomon in the place I now refer to, that <HI>God made man upright; but they have &s;ought out many inven|tions.</HI> He was a per&s;on of eminent wi&s;dom, of great ob&s;ervation, and very inqui&s;itive; and he could find nothing more certain, than the degeneracy and depravation of mankind. And this every one finds in him&s;elf, and may ob&s;erve in others. The hea|thens found it and complained of it, though they could not find out the cau&s;e of it; which the
<PB N="192" REF="028262_0195_0FD7F5D04ACE9618">Scripture acquaints us with, and herein is fulfilled in the experience of the whole world.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance in the labor, toil and &s;orrow, mankind was doomed to upon his &s;in and apo&s;tacy, which every one ta&s;tes of in one degree or other. As al&s;o, in the vanity and di&s;appointment that at|tends every undertaking and &s;tate. Nothing can be attained without labor and &s;orrow, nothing en|joyed without vanity: a &s;ort of cur&s;e flows down upon it, and mixes with the enjoyment. This is implied in the &s;entence pronounced, Gen. iii. 16, 17, 18, 19. Witne&s;&s;ed to abundantly in other Scriptures, particularly in the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, and confirmed by the experience of the whole world. Nor is it impertinent to mention here with re&s;pect to one &s;ex, her pains in child-bearing, which are greater than tho&s;e of any other females in the world, and were appointed as a peculiar puni&s;hment for the part the woman had in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; together with her more unea&s;y &s;ubjection to her hu&s;band. This the Scripture &s;peaks of with autho|rity and certainty, at the very beginning of the world: and it has had a con&s;tant confirmation du|ring a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>I may add, the &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed on all mankind. And let it be ob&s;erved, that according to the Scripture account, this was pronounced be|fore there was one example of death in the world; and before it could be known by any, but the great Lord of life, or tho&s;e to whom he would reveal it, whether any of the human race &s;hould die or not. And yet, this has been fulfilled univer&s;ally, except|ing two in&s;tances, where the great lawgiver interpo|&s;ed, and where the per&s;ons underwent &s;ome kind of an equivalent, a tran&s;lation in&s;tead of death. It has been fulfilled, I &s;ay, in every age and place, and continues to be &s;o, at this day. And it is very re|markable, that as the life of man, was prolonged for
<PB N="193" REF="028262_0196_0FD7F5DA1EC2AA10">&s;everal hundred years, in the fir&s;t ages, the better to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of he wi&s;e providence, that go|verns the world, and was at la&s;t reduced to three &s;core years and ten, as being the common &s;tandard, that is, the time of a full age, when nature &s;hould appear decayed and &s;pent; &s;o that if men do not die then, they will however, be langui&s;hing and dying: as, I &s;ay, the &s;tandard was thus fixed, it has been found the common mea&s;ure of life ever &s;ince, and men have died, as I may expre&s;s, according to the word of the world. The Scripture has pawned its truth and veracity upon this point, and that when there was no example of dying, as you have heard, that all men &s;hould die, &s;hould return to the du&s;t, and that in the revolution of &s;eventy years, they &s;hould at lea&s;t be ready to fall into it.</P>
<P>Now, could men, any men, by their own under|&s;tanding and fore&s;ight, not let into the &s;ecrets and purpo&s;es of the great governor of the world, could they draw &s;uch a &s;cheme of things? could they have recorded &s;uch matters? have given &s;uch an hi&s;tory of providence, for many ages and genera|tions to come, which is &s;o fully and punctually an|&s;wered in the event? was it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have done this, if they had not had intercour&s;e with the divinity, and had not &s;poke from God, who &s;aw the end, from the beginning?</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in &s;ome &s;pe|cial in&s;tances, towards particular families, nations, and people. The &s;ubject here is too large for me to trace through the particulars, that are known and certain: or, it would afford an ample confirmation of the divinity of the Bible; and not having room for it in this di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t leave it to another head, where it may be urged not le&s;s pertinently. In the mean time, I &s;hall ob&s;erve in general, that the &s;tate of Abraham's family, the &s;urpri&s;ing increa&s;e of it, when as yet he had no child, and according to
<PB N="194" REF="028262_0197_0FD7F6F820CED978">the cour&s;e of nature, was likely to have none. The &s;ojourning of his po&s;terity in Egypt, for four hun|dred years, their deliverance thence and &s;ettlement in the promi&s;ed land, with a great many amazing circum&s;tances, concerning their &s;ettlement, their apo&s;tacies, and puni&s;hments, their &s;everal captivi|ties and re&s;torations, with a multitude of things relating thereto; even till the coming of the Me&s;|&s;iah, and their final de&s;truction: all the&s;e are &s;et forth and de&s;cribed in the Scripture, with &s;o much po&s;itivene&s;s, &s;o di&s;tinctly, and with &s;uch an air of &s;overeignty, as leaves no room to que&s;tion, by who&s;e authority the Bible was written. And, as it de&s;cribes the &s;tate of the Jews, in all their revolu|tions, &s;o it paints the various &s;cenes of the chri&s;ti|an church, that have been, and that &s;hall be; I pre&s;ume to the end of the world. The&s;e we have in the books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and the revela|tions of John; to &s;ay nothing of the &s;ate of the &s;everal kingdoms of the Gentiles, again&s;t whom the prophets denounced judgments, the burthens of the Lord, as they expre&s;s it, again&s;t Idumea, Tyre, Sydon, &amp;c. all which prophecies, have been fulfilled, even in the mo&s;t minute cir|cum&s;tances, as we are a&s;&s;ured, in regard of the main branches of them; and in a manner, that gives the Scripture a triumph over all the cavils of infidel objectors, and will warrant, I think, this conclu&s;ion, that either the Bible is true, or God doth not govern the world. For, I cannot &s;ee but providence and the Bible, are in &s;uch connexion, that they &s;tand or fall together: and that whoever denies the one, mu&s;t give up the other al&s;o. Fur|ther,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Bible has been fulfilled towards particu|lar per&s;ons, in &s;ome very memorable in&s;tances, as towards Abraham, in&s;tanced in before, who&s;e concerns reach through many generations; where|in
<PB N="195" REF="028262_0198_0FD7DADEB08B0080">there are &s;uch marks of divine providence, as plainly imply, the per&s;ons who wrote the accounts, were under a divine conduct. To this, I may add, that denunciation of wrath again&s;t Eli's hou&s;e, which was to this effect, that God would certainly reject his family from the honor and dignity of the high prie&s;thood, for their profanation of &s;acred things, and &s;ub&s;titute another family in their room; that he him&s;elf &s;hould live to &s;ee the ark of God, that glory of I&s;rael, depart from them, and fall into the hands of the Phili&s;tines; that all the branches of his hou&s;e &s;hould die in the flower of their age, and that there &s;hould not be an old man among them, and that in&s;tead of the plenty they now lived in, and which they &s;o much abu&s;ed, they &s;hould be reduced to a piece of bread, and be forced to beg &s;ome mean employment of the high prie&s;ts, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors about the &s;anctuary, to keep them from &s;tarving; and that as a confirmation of all this, his two wicked &s;ons, Hophni and Phineas, &s;hould both die in one day. This is the threatning, the de&s;crip|tion laid down in Scripture of a future event; as you have it, 1 Sam. ii. 31, 32, &amp;c. and chap. iii. 11, 12, 13, 14. How it was fulfilled in all the parts of it, the Scripture hi&s;tory of Eli's hou&s;e lets us &s;ee, though neither my time nor your patience, will allow me to con&s;ider it. I &s;hall only take notice of one pa&s;&s;age, very remarkable, related by a grave author, that a certain family among the Jews being ob&s;erved to be &s;hort lived in an unu&s;ual manner, all of them dying about eighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they con&s;ulted a learned rabbi about the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a judgment. He advi&s;ed them to enquire into their genealogy, and &s;ee if they were not of the po&s;terity of Eli, to whom &s;uch a puni&s;hment was threatened of old; which they found to be their ca&s;e, and thence learn|ed the cau&s;e of that &s;evere di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="028262_0199_0FD7DAE436C3A740">
Of the &s;ame nature is what Jo&s;hua denounces again&s;t the builder of Jericho, that his elde&s;t &s;on &s;hould die when he attempted the work and laid the foundation of the city; that the re&s;t of his &s;ons &s;hould peri&s;h during the progre&s;s of the build|ing, and his younge&s;t at the &s;itting up the gates. The threatning is recorded, Jo&s;h. vi. 26. and the accompli&s;hment, 1 Kings xvi. 34. So exactly all along has divine providence commented upon the Bible, and verified its predictions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention farther under this head, the threatning of the prophet again&s;t his &s;ervant Gahazi and his po&s;terity, viz. That the lepro&s;y of Naaman &s;hould cleave to him and to his &s;eed forever, 2 Kings, v. 27. The inflicting of which judgment, as we have rea&s;on to expect it would be certain from the authority of him that denounced it, &s;o we have an intimation of it in a &s;tory, not unlike that I mentioned before, concerning the &s;hort lives of Eli's hou&s;e, viz. That a family of con&s;iderable note being leprous one after another in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on, enquiry was made into their de&s;cent, and it was found that they were of the po&s;terity of Gahazi. Thus true and infallible is the holy Scripture. What it predicts, it in&s;ures. An argument it could not be of human contrivance, but mu&s;t proceed from an all-comprehending mind, that had know|ledge to fore&s;ee and di&s;cern what would be, and right and authority to determine what &s;hould be. In a word, the Scripture is the di&s;clo&s;ure of the divine purpo&s;es, and contains the model and plan of the divine government. It points out future events, and is a &s;ort of a prophetic regi&s;ter, as I may &s;ay, of all the vici&s;&s;itudes and changes there are in human affairs, and of the proceedings of di|vine providence, whether in a way of rebuke and judgment, or mercy and deliverance, towards the world, towards the church, and towards particular
<PB N="197" REF="028262_0200_0FD7DAE77242DDF8">per&s;ons. And, as it has been hitherto verified, we may conclude, it &s;hall be &s;o &s;till, not one word &s;hall fail, nor one iota pa&s;s, till the whole be accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t particular under this head remains, which I mu&s;t be forced hereafter to re&s;ume. As it con|tains matter of &s;o much in&s;truction and confirma|tion to chri&s;tians, I cannot &s;atisfy my&s;elf to pa&s;s it over lightly. I &s;hall therefore in another di&s;cour&s;e &s;hew that the Scripture has been fulfilled, and con|tinues to be fulfilled in numerous in&s;tances in the two different &s;orts of men, good and bad. It gives the character, lays open the heart, principles, &s;tates and frames of both. Wicked men are exactly &s;uch as they are there repre&s;ented to be. Their inward thoughts, de&s;ires, affections are &s;uch as the word of God de&s;cribes them, And as for good men they find the Scripture a bright mirror wherein they view them&s;elves in all the varieties of their ca&s;e; at lea&s;t, they might do &s;o, and would do it more fully, did they &s;tudy the Scripture more, and un|der&s;tand them&s;elves better. So that the &s;en&s;ible, &s;erious chri&s;tian has a witne&s;s in him&s;elf that the Bible is the word of God. He finds it fulfilled in his own heart every day in &s;ome mea&s;ure; fulfil|led in the con&s;tant experience of his life; whence he is a&s;&s;ured it is true, and thence infers that it is divine.</P>

<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS an argument of the in&s;piration or divine ori|ginal of the Scripture, I mentioned the ac|compli&s;hment of it in all the circum&s;tances thereof. I ob&s;erved, that it has been fulfilled in the natural, material world, and in the moral world, or world of mankind. Under this la&s;t particular, I &s;hewed you,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That it has been, and is fulfilled, in &s;everal in&s;tances that concern mankind in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That it has been fulfilled in &s;ome &s;pecial in|&s;tances towards particular families, nations, and people. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Towards particular per&s;ons. I proceed now to &s;hew,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Scripture has been, and continues to be fulfilled in numerous in&s;tances in regard of the two different &s;orts in the great Divi&s;ion of man|kind, Bad men and good men. It has been ful|filled in the Repre&s;entation it makes of the hearts, principles, condition, and frame of both.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. It has been fulfilled in bad men, and is con|&s;tantly fulfilled in them. I &s;hall touch upon a few things to make this appear.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="200" REF="028262_0202_0FD7DAF5E2BDA188">
1. The Scripture is fulfilled in the account it gives of their inward principles and frame, with re&s;pect to God and Religion. As, that they know not God; that their carnal minds are enmity to him; that they are of this world, have the &s;pirit of the world, their portion in this life, and mind earthly things. That they are &s;en&s;ual, not having the &s;pirit; that they live without God in the world; that he is not in all their thoughts; they call not upon him. It repre&s;ents them as void of the fear and love of God, de&s;titute of all divine graces; having dark minds, hard hearts, &s;eared con&s;cien|ces, and being reprobate to every good work; and in con&s;equence of this, wanting the great di&s;tin|gui&s;hing ornaments of the new and divine nature, their hearts are &s;aid to be little worth, and they are compared to the chaff which the wind driveth away, and that &s;hall be burnt up with unquench|able fire. Now how evidently is all this verifi|ed in a large body of mankind. It is granted, the character being taken from the heart, it is not &s;o legible to us; but it is true of all the ungodly; they exactly an&s;wer this de&s;cription, and their con|formity hereto is in part obvious to the ob&s;ervation of others; their carnal minds and earthly frame are in &s;ome mea&s;ure manife&s;t in their practice. And every one that has had the experience of both &s;tates, has the confirmation hereof in his own brea&s;t. He knows what that darkne&s;s, ignorance, enmity, and carnality is, the Scripture makes the character of the wicked and un&s;anctified. What he &s;ees &s;uch woeful &s;ymptoms and indications of in others, once he experienced in him&s;elf. He was once alienated from the life of God; dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; once darkne&s;s, though now he be light in the Lord; and though he has not war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant to &s;ay preci&s;ely of &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, that they have the charac|ters of the ungodly; yet he can be a&s;&s;ured he was
<PB N="201" REF="028262_0203_0FD7DAFE0BB373F0">once one him&s;elf; and comparing what he ob&s;erves in others about him with what formerly he found within him, he remains convinced that the Scrip|ture account of this matter is true, and that were the hearts of wicked men laid open, as they will be at the great day, it would be evident they are there painted to the life.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture is fulfilled in the de&s;cription it gives of their antipathy to good men; their ha|tred of them, and oppo&s;ition to them, that Enmity God put between the &s;eed of the &s;erpent and that of the woman, has been working ever &s;ince. It &s;hewed it&s;elf carly in Cain, and has appeared in all following ages. There has all along been a gen|eration of men, that may properly be called a &s;er|pentine &s;eed; full of enmity again&s;t the &s;incere wor|&s;hippers of God, and followers of the Lamb: and though their enmity has been, and is di&s;gui&s;ed un|der various pretences, it is really levelled at the religion of the principles of piety and virtue in good men. This the apo&s;tle remarks concerning Cain, <HI>he was of that wicked one, and &s;lew his brother; and wherefore &s;lew he him, becau&s;e his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</HI> This was then the ground of the quarrel, and it remains &s;o to the pre&s;ent day. <HI>As he that was born after the fle&s;h, per&s;ecuted him that was born after the &s;pirit, even &s;o it is now,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul. So it was in the apo&s;tle's days, indeed, always was, and always will be. Thus the Scripture has told us of one &s;ort, at lea&s;t of wicked men; and I appeal to the ob&s;ervation and experience of every age, whether it is not fulfilled. <HI>The wicked in his pride doth per&s;ecute the poor.</HI> Sometimes they per&s;ecute with the tongue only, calling names, inventing invidious di&s;tinctions and terms of reproach; and &s;ometimes they proceed to more open methods of violence. But the enmity &s;till reigns in the heart, which way &s;oever it breaks forth.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="202" REF="028262_0204_0FD7F5DE51F0DD70">
3. The Scripture is fulfilled in the character it gives of this body of men, as to their outward cir|cum&s;tances; placing them on higher ground, and repre&s;enting them as the great men of this world. This character they have often in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, but more commonly in the New. <HI>Ye &s;ee your calling, brethren, how that not many wi&s;e men, after the fle&s;h, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.</HI> Where you will ob&s;erve, the per&s;ons of this con|dition, the rich, the mighty, are left out of the church. So el&s;ewhere, <HI>do not rich men oppre&s;s you? do not they bla&s;pheme that worthy name by which you are called?</HI> And again, <HI>go to, ye rich men, weep and howl for your mi&s;eries that &s;hall come upon you. Ye have lived in plea&s;ure on the earth, and been wanton. Ye have nouri&s;hed your hearts, as in a day of &s;laughter.</HI> Thus the Bible &s;peaks of that body of mankind, which it di&s;tingui&s;hes from the church. And no man, I think, can read the hi&s;tory of former times, or ob&s;erve the occurrences of his own, but mu&s;t &s;ee an exact accompli&s;hment thereof herein. Not that all rich men are bad men, or all bad men rich. But in that divi&s;ion I am &s;peaking of into two cla&s;&s;es or kinds, bad and good, the church and the world; it is evident according to Scripture, that bad men will have the greate&s;t portion of this world. In &s;hort, the Scripture &s;ets forth the danger of riches, in the mo&s;t lively terms; tells us, a rich man &s;hall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven; repre|&s;ents &s;uch as often abandoned to &s;en&s;uality, pride, oppre&s;&s;ion, to forgetfulne&s;s of God and religion. All which we have &s;een &s;o punctually fulfilled hi|therto, as may convince us there are no random gue&s;&s;es in Scripture; that it is a divine revelation, makes known what &s;hall be; containing the dictates of an infinitely wi&s;e, fore&s;eeing, I may add, of a &s;o|vereign mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of their inward di&s;qui|etude,
<PB N="203" REF="028262_0205_0FD7F5DF6870A558">want of proper tranquility and re&s;t of mind. The Scripture tells us, <HI>There is no peace to the wick|ed,</HI> that they <HI>are like the troubled &s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt.</HI> For the accompli&s;hment of this, I appeal to tho&s;e that once were in &s;uch a &s;tate, and are happily got out of it. I appeal to the per&s;ons them&s;elves, whether they do not find a thir&s;t and craving that cannot be &s;atisfied among the creatures: whether they have not many a time been weary of pur&s;uing vanities and gra&s;p|ing &s;hadows? whether their inward lu&s;ts do not vex and di&s;turb them; their outward enjoyments di&s;appoint them? and in a word, whether they be not utter &s;trangers to the &s;olid re&s;t and &s;atisfaction of pious, devout &s;ouls? They may indeed endea|vor to quiet con&s;cience, divert and amu&s;e them|&s;elves by little arts, and cheat them&s;elves into a fal&s;e peace; but after all, they find it will not do: their peace is a dream, their joy a fla&s;h. Nor can they re&s;t till they return to God, and re&s;t in him.</P>
<P>Thus the Scripture is fulfilled in regard of bad men: it is fulfilled in their moral character, in their outward &s;tate and circum&s;tances, in their enmity towards the church, in their di&s;order and unea&s;ine&s;s of mind.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is fulfilled likewi&s;e towards good men. I have here a large field, but mu&s;t &s;atisfy my&s;elf with the bare mention of &s;uch heads of di&s;cour&s;es, as would admit of great enlargement. It is ful|filled towards good men in general, and towards particular believers.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture is fulfilled towards good men in general, the whole church of chri&s;tians. I &s;hall illu&s;trate this in a few in&s;tances.</P>
<P>It repre&s;ents the church of Chri&s;t, as con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons mean and low, as to their circum&s;tances in the world. <HI>Not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h,</HI> &s;ays
<PB N="204" REF="028262_0206_0FD7F5E0EA036AB8">the apo&s;tle in the text I have quoted before, <HI>not many mighty, not many noble are called.</HI> And <HI>hath not God cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in &s;aith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promi&s;ed to them that love him.</HI> This is the con&s;tant language of Scripture. It every where intimates, that the followers of Chri&s;t would be of the meaner &s;ort. Indeed, every thing was at fir&s;t &s;o contrived, and the &s;cene &s;o laid, as plainly imported and &s;ignified this. Thus, when the Lord and head of the church came into the world, it was in circum&s;tances of great outward meanne&s;s. He did not appear with any of the pomp and grandeur of a temporal prince, but a&s;&s;umed the character of an ordinary mechanic; was called the carpenter's &s;on, and the carpenter. The prime mini&s;ters of his kingdom were cho&s;en from among fi&s;hermen. And it is remarked, at the beginning of his religion, that the <HI>poor had the Go&s;|pel preached to them,</HI> that is, were go&s;pellized, or brought to receive the go&s;pel. All which was a &s;ort of a type, as I may call it, or intimation of what he him&s;elf expre&s;sly declares, that his <HI>kingdom was not of this world.</HI> He did not intend to &s;et up a worldly kingdom, nor would the men of this world, that were fond of its di&s;tinctions and enjoyments be among the &s;ubjects of his kingdom. And a lit|tle ob&s;ervation, I think, may convince any compe|tent judges, that in this in&s;tance the Scripture has not wanted its accompli&s;hment. Not that the mem|bers of the chri&s;tian church are the abject and mi|&s;erably poor; but generally they are of the meaner &s;ort. Nor is it to be under&s;tood, as I hinted be|fore, that none of the great men of this world be|long thereto; but that not many of them do &s;o. This is what the Scripture affirms, and the event agrees to the account it gives. It may be o|therwi&s;e, indeed, before the end of the world, when the kings of the earth &s;hall bring their glory into
<PB N="205" REF="028262_0207_0FD7F5E28261AE20">the new Jeru&s;alem, which is but according to the Scripture prediction, and will be the accompli&s;h|ment of it. But, at pre&s;ent, the church of Chri&s;t is the congregation of the poor, as they are called, I mean the invi&s;ible church, the true genuine mem|bers thereof. For, as for mere profe&s;&s;ors and pre|tenders, that u&s;urp the chri&s;tian name without the chri&s;tian nature, by whatever title they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, whether catholic, chri&s;tian, or mo&s;t chri&s;ti|an, it is no objection again&s;t this; <HI>he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly,</HI> nor are all chri&s;tians, that bear that character.</P>
<P>The Scripture repre&s;ents the church al&s;o as the le&s;s, as well as the lower part of mankind. <HI>Fear not little flock,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>it is your Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdon.</HI> And el&s;ewhere, <HI>many are called, and few are cho&s;en.</HI> If it be under|&s;tood of the church compared with the world, the true church of Chri&s;t, the invi&s;ible church, com|pared with the re&s;t of mankind, the great body of hypocrites and &s;al&s;e profe&s;&s;ors; there can be no que&s;tion of its accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Again, the Scripture repre&s;ents the church, the real genuine members of it, as generally in a &s;tate of conflict, exerci&s;e and &s;orrow; whil&s;t the men of the world are in circum&s;tances of great freedom and ea&s;e, that appear more plau&s;ible and agreeable to common judges. Thus, <HI>ye &s;hall lament and weep, but the world &s;hall rejoice.</HI> And this is the con|&s;tant &s;train of Scripture; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>for they &s;hall be comforted.</HI> They that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t &s;uffer per|&s;ecution, and <HI>through much tribulation we mu&s;t enter into the kingdom of neaven.</HI> And even when we are told, that they who <HI>for&s;ake father or mother, &amp;c. &s;hall receive a hundred fold in the pre&s;ent life, and in the world to come eternal life:</HI> it is added, with per&s;e|cutions, Mark x. 30. intimating, that the church

The ac|compli&s;hment of which has been matter of experi|ence and ob&s;ervation through every age: good men have generally been the butt of the world's malice.

But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, they have their exerci&s;es, burthens, fears, their hours of weeping and humiliation, their deep aba&s;ements and &s;elf-an|nihilations, as I may call them, &s;uch as the world knows nothing of.

<PB N="207" REF="028262_0209_0FD7F5E798AF7928">church has been pre&s;erved in the mid&s;t of all its adver&s;aries. Two things add a lu&s;tre and glory to this providence. It has met with the mo&s;t pow|erful oppo&s;ition. Never had any body &s;uch for|midable enemies, and yet it has &s;urvived all. And further, other kingdoms have &s;unk under a far le&s;s weight. The four famous monarchies, the A&s;&s;yrian, Medo-Per&s;ian, Greek, and Roman, that thought them&s;elves invincible, and had all external advan|tages to render them &s;o, are peri&s;hed and come to nothing. And yet the church de&s;titute of all hu|man help, headed by a carpenter, as he was called and appeared in the world, and by a few poor fi&s;h|ermen, has &s;tood its ground and weathered the point to this day. The billows have raged and the mountains been ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; but God has always been in the mid&s;t of his church, <HI>a river has made glad the city of God.</HI></P>
<P>The Scripture repre&s;ents the Church of God as mixed with hypocrites, a company of pretenders, joining in profe&s;&s;ion with the upright followers of the Lord Je&s;us; that have the Lamb's mark on their foreheads. This we have in various parables as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">in other texts; as in the parable of the <HI>net ca&s;t into the &s;ea, the tares &s;own among the wheat, the wi&s;e and fooli&s;h virgins.</HI> And I need not &s;tand to &s;hew you, that it has had its accompli&s;hment hi|therto, that the church has herein exactly an&s;wer|ed the de&s;cription of the word, and appeared in the form, or according to the model drawn by the great Lord and founder of it.</P>
<P>I add, The Scripture repre&s;ents the church in a great variety of &s;tates; as undergoing &s;undry chan|ges, and appearing in different &s;hapes. At fir&s;t it was like a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, little and ob&s;cure, and then was to grow up to a great tree, and in different periods to put on different fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es: &s;ome|times to be oppre&s;&s;ed, its witne&s;&s;es lying in &s;ack|cloth,
<PB N="208" REF="028262_0210_0FD7F5E79F7BA1A0">and prophe&s;ying in &s;able; and then to be enlarged: &s;ometimes to apo&s;tati&s;e and grow luke|warm, &s;ecure, and carele&s;s; and then again to re|vive, and appear in its lu&s;tre and glory. This we have de&s;cribed in &s;everal prophecies and particu|larly in the Revelations, under the type of the &s;e|ven A&s;ian churches. And the providence of God has been fulfilling the &s;ame in every age &s;ince the going forth of the word of prophecy; part of which we have &s;een, and the re&s;t we wait for. You read when the church was only a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, you have &s;een it a great tree. You have heard of its general defection, and have &s;een its re|formation in &s;ome mea&s;ure. And we have rea&s;on to expect it will appear in greater glory than it has ever yet done, But what I offer, is, that the Scrip|ture points at all the&s;e revolutions, vici&s;&s;itudes, and changes; and that the Sovereign Ruler of the world has ordered events an&s;werable to the pre|dictions and characters given of things therein. Thus it has been with reference to the church in general. And I am now to remark,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Scripture has been fulfilled towards particular believers; and that with reference to their call into the church, their character and prin|ciples, their in firmities, the promi&s;es made to them, and the threatenings denounced again&s;t them for their cha&s;ti&s;ement and correction.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture has been fulfilled in their call into the church. And here I may take notice that the Bible repre&s;ents the different characters of the per&s;ons called, &s;ome as notoriou&s;ly wicked, &s;inners before the Lord exceedingly; as the prodigal &s;on, Mary Magdalene; &s;ome among the Corinthians, as the apo&s;tle tells us, 1 Cor, vi. 9, 10, 11. Some as le&s;s infamous and &s;candalous, as the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, Nicodemus, Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, Philip, and Lydia, who are not mentioned with any nota|ble
<PB N="209" REF="028262_0211_0FD7F5F4E82F52B0">blot upon them, or mark of infamy: &s;ome as per&s;ons of purer morality, walking with greater caution, according to the light of their own minds, which was the ca&s;e of the apo&s;tle Paul, and it is likely of other of the converts from among the Jews.</P>
<P>The Scripture al&s;o repre&s;ents the different man|ner of their call; &s;ome with more terror and con|&s;ternation, as Peter's converts that were pricked at their hearts, the gaoler who cried out, <HI>Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> The&s;e were recovered and brought home to God in a more awful manner. He prefaced the work with the voice of thunder. Others were called with a &s;mall &s;till voice, feeling little of the terrors of the Lord, as Philip, Zacheus, Lydia, and it may be, mo&s;t of the apo&s;tles. Now as the&s;e things happened for examples, they mu&s;t he con&s;idered as a kind of Scripture type of future conver&s;ions in the different manner and circum&s;tan|ces of them. And I dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not but herein the Scripture has from time to time been fulfilled; as the experience of chri&s;tians can witne&s;s; whil&s;t &s;ome are able to &s;ay, this was my ca&s;e, another that was mine. And no que&s;tion, if we take in the whole body of the faithful, every ca&s;e will be found touched and de&s;cribed in Scripture. Nor is there a true convert in the world, but the word of God points to him; &s;hews him in the various po&s;tures of his mind, and in all his tendencies towards God. A glorious argument of the divinity of the Bible, though all do not under&s;tand it, and it may be &s;ome will laugh at, and de&s;pi&s;e it; glorious will it app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> when the church is complete, and the &s;aints come to compare notes in heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in the cha|racter, and principles of believers. A chri&s;tian has the <HI>law of God written in his heart,</HI> and is a &s;ort of living Bib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. Time will not allow me to enlarge
<PB N="210" REF="028262_0212_0FD7F5FBB9DEC608">much. But let me remark, that the Scripture eve|ry where &s;peaks of a generation of per&s;ons di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the world, by an inward &s;anctification. It calls them &s;aints, believers, the righteous children of light, the &s;ons of God, the ex|cellent of the earth, and the like. And as bad as the world is, there &s;till are, and always have been &s;ome that appear to belong to this body, and &s;hall be to the end of time. Farther, the Scripture de&s;|cribes them by &s;uch characters as are a &s;ufficient di&s;tinction between them and the re&s;t of mankind, by which they may be known certainly to them|&s;elves, and probably to others: as that they <HI>are not of the world,</HI> that they <HI>do not commit &s;in,</HI> that they <HI>have crucified the fle&s;h with the affections and lu&s;ts,</HI> that they <HI>&s;et their affections on things above, and not on things on the earth,</HI> that they <HI>hunger and thir&s;t af|ter righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that they are &s;en&s;ible of pre&s;ent infirmities, and <HI>forgetting things behind, and reaching forth unto things before, they pre&s;s towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us.</HI> It repre&s;ents them as as&s;piring after God, making him their centre, breathing after him, and re&s;ting in him, and as cloathed with all divine gra|ces, all glorious within. Nor are the&s;e accidental &s;trokes that belong to &s;ome rare &s;aints, but the pro|per character of all believers; though indeed with much variety; &s;ome having the &s;everal graces in greater eminency and lu&s;tre, others more faintly and with greater alloys, according to the di&s;tinction the Scripture it&s;elf mentions of babes, little children and fathers.</P>
<P>Well, thus the Scripture &s;peaks of the church, and thus the church has been from the very foun|dation of it to this day. There is not one mem|ber thereof, but appears with the characters the word of God has provided for him; he has the
<PB N="211" REF="028262_0213_0FD7F5FC9E5E6618">heart, the frame, the principles, there appointed and &s;et forth as the ornament of believers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Scripture is fulfilled in their infirmities al&s;o. Though they be &s;aints, that &s;peaks of them, as imperfect &s;aints; repre&s;ents them as having a <HI>body of &s;in, a law in their members, waring again&s;t the law of</HI> their <HI>minds; the fle&s;h lu&s;ting again&s;t the &s;pirit; as not having yet attained nor being already perfect.</HI> It repre&s;ents the heart deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked, which is true of good men in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as well as others. <HI>The &s;pirit that is in them lu&s;teth to envy,</HI> and other vices. Whence they have their inward conflicts, and fre|quent &s;truggles with their corruptions.</P>
<P>It repre&s;ents them in a great variety of frames: &s;ometimes their hearts following hard after God, triumphing in his favor, and exulting in his pre|&s;ence; at other times, over&s;pread with clouds and darkne&s;s, filled with fear, and wholly indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;piritual conver&s;e and acts of devotion. It re|pre&s;ents the be&s;t of them as weak and defectible, as &s;ometimes off their guard, &s;ecure and pre&s;ump|tuous, and thereupon falling into &s;in. To which purpo&s;e the mi&s;carriages of the &s;aints are left upon record in Scripture; not merely to tell us what they have done, but what others would be like to do in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, when for their pride and &s;elf-confidence, God leaves them to them|&s;elves; and they are written for the admonition and caution of the church in future ages. In the mean time, they &s;hew the frailty of believers, in their pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate. In &s;hort, the Scripture repre&s;ents them as falling out by the way, running into parties and &s;chi&s;ms; uncharitably cen&s;uring one another, and indulging mutual pa&s;&s;ions to the di&s;grace and &s;candal of their profe&s;&s;ion. A great deal of this is hinted concerning them in the New
<PB N="212" REF="028262_0214_0FD7F5FE709145F8">Te&s;tament. And that the&s;e particulars are accom|pli&s;hed, is matter of con&s;tant and univer&s;al expe|rience; I appeal to every heart and con&s;cience among the generation of God's children, and am &s;atisfied there are too many witne&s;&s;es of the truth to need any further confirmation.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Scripture is fulfilled in the promi&s;es thereof towards believers. And here I have a &s;ubject that I could with plea&s;ure employ an hour upon. But I mu&s;t be forced to pa&s;s it over in a good mea&s;ure, and leave every chri&s;tian to &s;upply the defect out of his own experience. All the pro|mi&s;es of God, <HI>the exceeding great and precious pro|mi&s;es</HI> are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>yea and amen.</HI> All are true, faithful and &s;ure; as every one has found that has tried them, every believer from the beginning of the world to this day. Let me ob&s;erve very briefly, that there are &s;ome general promi&s;es con|&s;tantly fulfilled towards all believers; as that God <HI>will never leave them nor for &s;ake them;</HI> that he <HI>will not &s;uffer</HI> them <HI>to be tempted above what</HI> they can <HI>bear, but will, with the temptation, make a way for their e&s;cape;</HI> that <HI>all things &s;hall work together for good to them that love God,</HI> that he will give them his <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> that he will <HI>manife&s;t</HI> him&s;elf to them, <HI>be their God,</HI> and they &s;hall be his <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P>Further, there are occa&s;ional promi&s;es, as I may call them, adapted to the circum&s;tances of particu|lar per&s;ons, and which they, in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, happily experience the accompli&s;hment of; as &s;up|port under burthens, direction and conduct in dif|ficulties, when &s;en&s;ible of our own weakne&s;s, we tru&s;t in the Lord with all our hearts, and lean not to our own under&s;tanding, help in prayer, an&s;wers of prayer, comfort in tribulation, and the like. A multitude of promi&s;es there are in the Scripture, wonderfully &s;uited to all the ca&s;es of chri&s;tians that I mu&s;t not &s;tand now to collect: all which have
<PB N="213" REF="028262_0215_0FD7F5FFCF3572A8">been accompli&s;hed in every age of the church. Every chri&s;tian can &s;et to his &s;eal in this matter, though with more or le&s;s clearne&s;s, according as he is more or le&s;s exerci&s;ed and experienced in the di|vine life.</P>
<P N="5">5. I might &s;hew, that the Scripture is accom|pli&s;hed in the threatnings of it towards good men, in the corrections and cha&s;ti&s;ements frequently in|timated in ca&s;e of back&s;liding, the omi&s;&s;ion of duty, carele&s;ne&s;s in the performance, re&s;training prayer, want of watchfulne&s;s, attention and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in their walk and conduct. In the&s;e ca&s;es, God threatens he <HI>will vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the rod and their iniquities with &s;tripes.</HI> Nor have we only general, but even particular threatnings, de&s;igned as a rebuke to particular failings and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. All which, in their time, &s;ea&s;on and manner, are fulfilled in God's di&s;cipline, towards his children and &s;ervants. In &s;hort, this is a general experi|ence, and it is a perfect accompli&s;hment of the di|vine word; that if the chri&s;tian grows &s;ecure and carele&s;s, le&s;s prayerful and watchful, God with|draws and hides his face; the &s;pirit is grieved and &s;tands at a di&s;tance: in con&s;equence whereof the chri&s;tian finds his chariot wheels taken off, he has neither light nor comfort, little &s;trength for duty, and little enjoyment in it.</P>
<P>Thus the Scripture is fulfilled in all the parts of it: fulfilled towards the world, towards the church, towards particular believers, in the characters, pro|mi&s;es and threatnings of it.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to make &s;ome remarks upon the&s;e particulars, in order to &s;hew the force of this ar|gument for proving the divinity of the Scripture. Had it been a human writing, proceeded from men, without any intelligence from above, it could never have de&s;cribed the &s;tate of the natural and moral world &s;o accurately as it has done, and &s;o agreeably
<PB N="214" REF="028262_0216_0FD7F6038E0A1208">to the even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and i&s;&s;ues of things. The Scripture exhibits and gives us a plan and &s;cheme of the di|vine government of the world; of the different &s;tates of the world and church; of the church in general; and of the &s;everal members of it; of good men and bad men. It repre&s;ents them in their va|rious frames, principles, and di&s;po&s;itions; in their various outward circum&s;tances and conditions; in their various &s;piritual &s;tates, their conflicts, trials, temptations, &s;ufferings and comforts. This it doth in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch a perfect agreement and corre&s;pondence to the providence of God in the con&s;tant cour&s;e thereof, making &s;uch beautiful harmony between the divine providence and the holy Scripture, as is a full evidence that the Bible is from God, and that he who governs the world indited it. Now that this argument may appear in its proper light and force, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few ob|&s;ervations without dwelling long upon them. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the great author of nature and governor of the world had in his own mind a full view and comprehen&s;ion of his works. A perfect &s;cheme, idea, or model thereof, as I may call it. This, I think, we may conclude from the exact wi&s;dom, regularity, and order with which he proceeds in all of them; and the Scripture gives intimations of it. Thus in the hi&s;tory of the creation, after the form|ing the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es and parcels of his creatures, it is &s;aid of each, <HI>God &s;aw that it was good;</HI> and at the clo&s;e of all, when the great Creator came to re|view his work, it is &s;aid, <HI>he &s;aw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good,</HI> that is, was ju&s;t what God de&s;igned it, proportioned and fitted to its place and &s;tation among the creatures, and to the end of its maker. And we are told by the apo&s;|tle, that God <HI>worketh all things according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n&s;el of his own will.</HI> When he purpo&s;ed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed that there &s;hould be a world, there was a
<PB N="215" REF="028262_0217_0FD7F6052D9E40D0">coun&s;el of his will, a wi&s;e plan and &s;cheme, accord|ing to which he determined all things &s;hould be made, and all things &s;hould be governed. Now he governeth all things in nature, providence and grace, according to this <HI>coun&s;el of his will.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The coun&s;el of God, this plan of the divine works and government, is in part laid down in Scripture. I &s;ay in part, for I know not that I have warrant to affirm, that the Bible contains all God's purpo&s;es, and the whole &s;cheme of his coun|&s;els and decrees. But it contains what concerns our world, the great maxims of his government, the different &s;tates of his &s;ubjects here, and the chief events of his providence towards them from time to time. In the Scripture the Book of the divine decrees is opened, as it were. We are there told of his creating a world according to his purpo&s;e; in what manner he proceeded in that work; and how he would proceed in the government of it. And I reckon the cour&s;e of his providence in the main revolutions and changes there would be in the world, and in the &s;everal grand di&s;pen&s;ations of it, at lea&s;t, are there de&s;cribed as they have been, and will be, from the beginning of the world to the end thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the Scripture was written chie&s;ly for the u&s;e of the church: and it may be, I might add, the world continued and governed with regard to the intere&s;t and concerns of the church; &s;o the &s;cheme of divine providence exhibited and laid down there chie&s;ly re&s;pects it. Not that the re&s;t of mankind are pa&s;&s;ed over wholly. The Scrip|ture frequently takes notice of the affairs of the world in general, and of particular kingdoms and nations without the pale. Nor do I &s;uppo&s;e all the affairs of the church, nor of the &s;everal mem|bers of it, are repre&s;ented in Scripture and inclu|ded in its map. But the general &s;tate thereof, its
<PB N="216" REF="028262_0218_0FD7F60900FA88B8">vici&s;&s;itudes and changes, the main in&s;tances of pro|vidence and grace towards it, and the particular members of it; the&s;e things the Scripture repre|&s;ents. It tells us, what the &s;tate of it has been, and what it &s;hall be in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages; what the &s;everal members of it always have been, and will be; what they fear and &s;uffer, and what they en|joy; what their warfare would be; what their con|&s;licts, toils, and victories: and in &s;hort, in what way they &s;hould be di&s;ciplined and prepared for hea|ven.</P>
<P N="4">4. Every thing contained in the Scripture, as part of the divine coun&s;el for the government of the world; &s;uppo&s;ing the Scripture is God's word, and really contains &s;uch a &s;cheme, will be infalli|bly accompli&s;hed. The purpo&s;es of God mall &s;tand. His words will not, cannot, fall to the ground. Hence we read, that &s;uch or &s;uch a thing was done, or came to pa&s;s, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. It is as nece&s;&s;ary, according to the hy|pothe&s;is, or &s;uppo&s;ition, I am now upon, that the Scripture &s;hould be fulfilled, as that the world &s;hould be made. For as the creation of the world was an accompli&s;hment of God's purpo&s;e and coun&s;el in that particular; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of every event in the government of it; e&s;pecially as it is en&s;ured to us in the Scripture. Not one iota, or tittle, &s;hall pa&s;s till the whole be fulfilled. The rea&s;on is, it proceeds from God, the God of truth and wi&s;dom; and nothing can fall out to di&s;|appoint an infinite under&s;tanding. I add,</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;lfilling of the Scripture is a gradual thing, not done all at once, but &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. For it contains God's &s;cheme of providence and go|vernment for many generations. Some of it is fulfilled in one age; &s;uch parts of it as refer to particular events, that were to take place at this or that time: as, the de&s;truction of the old world by
<PB N="217" REF="028262_0219_0FD7F61AF4A1BD58">water; the &s;lavery of Abraham's po&s;terity in E|gypt; their &s;ettlement in Canaan; their captivity and deliverance; the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; and the like. Some of it is con&s;tantly fulfilled; as, what concerns the &s;tate of the natural world in gen|eral; and the world of mankind, of good men, and bad men; who always were, and will be, &s;uch as the Scripture de&s;cribes them, an&s;wering the char|acters there laid down of their re&s;pective &s;tates, principles, and manner of acting. Some of it, in|deed a great deal of it, as it points out particular events, has been fulfilled; and &s;ome remains to be fulfilled, and will have its accompli&s;hment in its proper time, in the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages of the church and periods yet to come: as, the fall of An|tichri&s;t; the la&s;t great &s;truggle of the followers of the Lamb with the followers of the bea&s;t: the Mil|lennium; the re&s;urrection of the body; and the final judgment. The Scripture is an entire Sy|nop&s;is, or general view of the whole cour&s;e of pro|vidence, towards the church e&s;pecially; and con|&s;equently will not all be fulfilled till the la&s;t &s;cene is acted.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the whole work of God in the me|thod of providence is fini&s;hed, and the entire &s;cheme or wi&s;e council of God, as laid down in Scripture, is perfected; and all has taken place in regular and orderly events, the argument from hence, that the Scripture is from God, or given by divine in&s;piration, will appear with greater advan|tage; partly as it will be more full and &s;trong, being grounded upon the accompli&s;hment of all the Scrip|ture; partly as it will &s;tand in a fuller light, with|out being ob&s;cured by that darkne&s;s, prejudice, and want of experience, which now attend per&s;ons and hinder them from di&s;cerning the evidence of this matter. I doubt not, but in that more amiable &s;tate of things which we expect in this world, as
<PB N="218" REF="028262_0220_0FD7F61DE173DBA8">the church will &s;ee more of the accompli&s;hment of the Scripture, &s;o it will &s;ee it more clearly. But, when the end cometh, when the whole my&s;tery of providence is compleated, and the <HI>Son &s;hall give up the Kingdom to God, even the Father,</HI> this argument will appear triumphant, the whole Bible &s;tand in a glorious light, and a per&s;ect harmony between Scripture and providence be &s;een to the conviction of all. The contemplation of which will probably be &s;ome of the bu&s;ine&s;s of heaven, and among the entertainments of the &s;aints there. In the mean time,</P>
<P N="7">7. So much of the Scripture is already accompli&s;h|ed, and evidently appears to be &s;o; as is &s;ufficient at pre&s;ent to give this argument great weight. There is a &s;urpri&s;ing concurrence between the Scrip|ture and providence. They have hitherto run pa|rallel. The world has been &s;uch as the Bible re|pre&s;ents it &s;hould be. It has been governed in the manner that de&s;cribes, and a multitude of wonder|ful events have taken place in the very time and way the Scripture &s;ets forth. Now it ought to be confidered, that the&s;e things were foretold, &s;poken of there as what &s;hould be, certainly be, and be in &s;uch a manner, long before the things them&s;elves came to pa&s;s. What David &s;ays with referrence to divine providence in his formation, may be ac|commodated to this prupo&s;e, <HI>thine eyes did &s;ee my &s;ub&s;tance yet being imperfiect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fa&s;hioned, when as yet there was none of them:</HI> the &s;ame may, in a &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid of the writers of the Scripture, they &s;aw, as it were, the &s;ub&s;tance of all future things, all the great tran&s;actions of provi|dence upon the theatre of the world in the various &s;tates and changes of human affairs, and they wrote down all the members and particulars thereof, which in time come to be fini&s;hed, and receive their
<PB N="219" REF="028262_0221_0FD7F61F20165EE8">being while yet there was none of them. Now who could do this but God? or, which is the &s;ame thing, tho&s;e that &s;aw with his light. In &s;hort, the Scripture holds before our view the various faces of the world: the various &s;tates and po&s;tures of af|fairs therein, and the various tempers of mens hearts. And the experience of &s;everal thou&s;and years, the con&s;tant daily experience of all good men perfectly accords therewith. And this, I think, to be in its kind, next to a demon&s;tration, that the writers of the Bible did not &s;peak of them&s;elves, from private impul&s;e, like weak and &s;hort &s;ighted creatures, as all men are, not knowing certainly what &s;hall be on the morrow; but they &s;pake from God, and as they were moved and taught by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;et before you the fourth argu|ment I propo&s;ed, to prove the Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, viz. the external marks and characters that attend it: and have in&s;i&s;ted &s;ome|what copiou&s;ly on one branch of it, the accompli&s;h|ment of Scripture. The u&s;efulne&s;s and impor|tance of which argument, I reckon to be &s;uch, that it well de&s;erves a volume by it&s;elf. Nor do I think any one could better employ his time, and with more &s;ervice to the church of God, than by &s;etting it forth in its &s;trength. Which mu&s;t be my excu&s;e that I have &s;aid &s;o much upon it; as a regard to your patience is the be&s;t excu&s;e, that I can make, that I have &s;aid no more.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IX. THE DIVINE ORIGINAL AND INSPIRATION OF THE SCRIPTURE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;priration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE already offered &s;everal arguments to prove the divine original or in&s;piration of the Scriptures, and having gone through tho&s;e I pro|ceed now to another.</P>
<P N="5">V. This truth may be argued from the te&s;timony that God gave to the penmen of the Scriptures, as by miracles, prophecy, the &s;preading of their doc|trine, and the glorious effects of it upon the hearts of men in their &s;anctification. Hereby he has &s;et to his &s;eal that the Scripture is true, is divine, and is his word. I &s;hall go over the particulars in their order, beginning with the fir&s;t of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. God has borne te&s;timony to the writers of the Scripture, and to the things there written, by mira|cles. I have &s;tood too long on former arguments to in&s;i&s;t largely on this. I &s;hall briefly repre&s;ent the matter of fact; &s;hew that the penmen of Scrip|ture wrought miracles, and what miracles they wrought. And then con&s;ider the argument from hence, how this proves they were in&s;pired.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall briefly repre&s;ent the matter of fact,
<PB N="222" REF="028262_0223_0FD7F622E108AE28">&s;hew that the penmen of the Scripture wrought mi|racles, and what miracles they wrought.</P>
<P>What a miracle is, what are the proper di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characters of tho&s;e works that we admit as miraculous, it mu&s;t be owned, is a matter of &s;ome difficulty to determine. The common difi|nition of a miracle, is an extraordinary operation, contrary to the &s;ettled laws of nature, wrought by the infinite power of God. "It is," &s;aith a learn|ed man,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Kidder.</NOTE> <Q>a work above the power of nature, and above the reach of any creature what&s;oever</Q> And another &s;ays,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Charles Wol&s;eley.</NOTE> <Q>it is that which properly can have no &s;econd cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> for its author.</Q> Such as no &s;econd cau&s;e, in the judgment of rea&s;on, can effect. Another calls it,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stilling fleet.</NOTE> <Q>a production of &s;ome|thing out of nothing, either in the thing it&s;elf or manner of producing it;</Q> which he affirms can be effected by no le&s;s than an omnipotent arm. And on this account &s;ome critics remark, miracles are termed in Scripture, powers, being works of a divine and infinite power. And this is the more generally received account of the matter. A mi|racle is thought to be &s;omething above the ordin|ary power of nature, as it is contrary to the laws of it. And whenever it is wrought, or by whate|ver in&s;trument, it is the work of God and proclaims omnipotence.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, that &s;ome others are willing to come lower. The ingenious Mr. Lock defines a miracle thus: <Q>It is, &s;ays he, a &s;en&s;ible opera|tion which being above the comprehen&s;ion of the &s;pectator, and in his opinion contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, is by him taken to be divine.</Q> But acknowledging there is a real difficulty in &s;tating this point, ari&s;ing from our not
<PB N="223" REF="028262_0224_0FD7F623240F4ED8">under&s;tanding fully the laws of nature, and the power of &s;econd cau&s;es; and, con&s;equently, what things are contrary to tho&s;e laws, and above the capacity of created beings; I do not think this much affects the pre&s;ent argument, for certainly many of the facts we have to alledge, as performed by the authors of the Scripture Revelation, and tho&s;e that were employed in it, mu&s;t be admitted to be &s;uch as could proceed from none but God. Either they are divine works, extraordinary mira|culous operations, or never any &s;uch were laid be|fore mankind, and offered to the te&s;t of human judgment. So that, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t philo&s;ophi&s;ing over nicely here, and fixing the exact bounds between created and uncreated power, determining the ut|mo&s;t that a creature, a man or an angel can do, and what God only can do, I think it mu&s;t be al|lowed, the facts recorded in Scripture, and that we place to the head of miracles, mu&s;t pa&s;s for mira|cles, or I cannot &s;ee that there ever were, or can be, any miracle in the world, or that any u&s;e can be made of tho&s;e extraordinary phaenomena and di&s;|plays of divine providence that have always in the accounts of mankind been e&s;teemed miraculous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were compo&s;ed, the notion and nature of miracles has been much better &s;tated, than ever before by the Reverend Mr. Samuel Chandler, in his ingenious vindication of the chri&s;tian religion. Who defines a miracle in genneral, <Q>an action done, or an operation vi&s;ibly performed, by any being, that is really and truly above the reach, power and capacity of that being who doth it, to perform of him&s;elf, and without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;uperior agent.</Q> And a miracle when done by a man in confirmation of a divine mi&s;&s;ion, is, according to him, <Q>&s;omewhat vi&s;ibly performed by him in order to prove him&s;elf to be &s;ent of God, which is &s;trictly and truly above all his natural powers and capacities, and which he could not of him&s;elf per|form without the influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;uperior a|gent.</Q> So that what is or is not a miracle is to be determined by the agreement and proportion between the action performed, and the capacities and powers of the agent. If the action done be certainly above all the powers of the agent, of him&s;elf, and un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted to perform it, is a true and proper miracle, and proves the co-operation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome invi&s;ible and &s;uperior being. That may therefore be a miracle in regard of one agent that is not &s;o with regard to another of greater ability and power; that may be a miracle when done by a man, that would be none if done by an angel. For &s;ince no beings can po&s;&s;ibly of them&s;elves perform any thing beyond their natural powers and capacities, whenever they are in&s;trumental in doing any thing of this kind, it mu&s;t argue the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other and higher being. If a man doth what is above the reach of, human abilities, he performs a real miracle, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a&s;&s;i&s;|ted by &s;ome &s;uperior agent. Now this is manife&s;tly the ca&s;e of that wonderful works here urged in behalf of chri&s;tianity and the Bible.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="028262_0225_0FD7F63017CB1C38">
Having promi&s;ed thus much for &s;tating the point and obviating cavils, I &s;hall briefly touch the facts them&s;elves, tho&s;e things which the Scripture re|cords as miraculous operations. And here I would ob&s;erve, that all whom God employed to make known any new laws, or reveal any new doctrines to the world, came with the power of miracles, which were their credentials, or the certain tokens that he &s;ent them. Thus did Mo&s;es, thus did Chri&s;t, and thus did the apo&s;tles. Mo&s;es delivered a body of laws to the Jews, which he profe&s;&s;ed to receive from God; to prove which, he wrought miracles among them.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve again, that the miracles, which the&s;e per&s;ons wrought, were numerous, open, and manifect in the face of the world; and had the highe&s;t characters of divinity in them that any facts ever had, that have been propo&s;ed to the world, under the character of miracles. I &s;hall not give you the li&s;t of them. They are known to &s;uch as are conver&s;ant with the Bible. Mo&s;es offers a &s;pe|cimen of his power immediately upon his call to his office; his rod is turned into a &s;erpent, and then turned into a rod again. The ten miraculous judgments inflicted on Pharaoh and his people,
<PB N="225" REF="028262_0226_0FD7F63209618510">every body has heard of. You have them record|ed in Exod. vii. 8, 9, 10, 11. He afterwards di|vides by his rod the waters of the Red Sea. In the wilderne&s;s he appears glorious, as the mini&s;ter of heaven, by a power of miracles that con&s;tantly attended him, and which he exerted on all occa&s;i|ons. Thus he cured the bitter waters at Marah, by ca&s;ting a tree into them, Exod. xv. 24, 25. brought waters out of the rock by &s;miting it with his rod, Exod. xvii. 6. &s;ub&s;i&s;ted forty days on the mount without food, when by his heavenly con|ver&s;e, his face acquired an angelical lu&s;tre. And you find when his authority was di&s;puted, and his pre-eminence unrea&s;onably cavilled at, God was plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e, and by a miracle, make a de|ci&s;ion in his favor, puni&s;hing Miriam with the le|pro&s;y, Numb. xii. and afterwards upon occa&s;ion of another in&s;tance of the contempt of his authority, and of an affront to his mi&s;&s;ion, the earth opens and &s;wallows up the contenders; and Aaron's rod is made to blo&s;&s;om as a public &s;ignal of God's elec|tion and appointment of him and Mo&s;es, Numb. xvi. 17. Thus you &s;ee Mo&s;es the fir&s;t lawgiver to the church, and fir&s;t writer of Scripture, was a worker of miracles. God hereby bore te&s;timony to him, owned his mini&s;try, and &s;ealed his mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And what miracles Chri&s;t wrought, who came to e&s;tabli&s;h a new law, and deliver a new &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion to the world, I need not tell you. <HI>Go and &s;hew John,</HI> &s;aith he, to one of his di&s;ciples, <HI>tho&s;e things which ye do hear and &s;ee, the blind receive their &s;ight, and the lame walk, the leapers are clean&s;ed, and the deaf hear, the dead are rai&s;ed up, and the poor have the go&s;pel preached to them,</HI> Matt. xi. 4, 5. In &s;hort, he &s;hewed a power over univer&s;al nature, wrought all &s;orts of miracles, and that in the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing manner. He did the works that never man did; and yet tells his di&s;ciples, the &s;ame, and greater
<PB N="226" REF="028262_0227_0FD7F63386120038">works they &s;hould do in his name, which their hi&s;tory confirms.</P>
<P>It is further ob&s;ervable, that this power of work|ing miracles was continued with the church, and was exerted by tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;tian religion for &s;ome ages. Many in&s;tances I might give of this, but mu&s;t forbear.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only take notice of a bold challenge which the chri&s;tians &s;ometimes made to the greate&s;t empe|rors, that if they were brought before the &s;eats of their gods, if they did not force them to depart and make them confe&s;s them&s;elves to be devils and wicked &s;pirits, they would &s;uffer all &s;orts of pun|i&s;hments. They pretended to ca&s;t out devils in the name of Chri&s;t, to triumph over the heathen oracles; and &s;o confident were they of their pow|er herein, that in their di&s;putes with their heathen adver&s;aries, they offered to put the credit of their cau&s;e upon their &s;ucce&s;s in this matter.</P>
<P>I add, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable miracle of all was the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead. This he him&s;elf foretold before it came to pa&s;s, even when his di&s;ciples them&s;elves neither under&s;tood it, nor believed it. He bid them <HI>de&s;troy</HI> that <HI>temple,</HI> viz. his body, and he would <HI>build it up again in three days.</HI> And he did &s;o accordingly: which &s;ingle fact is a &s;ufficient confirmation of the chri&s;tian re|ligion. It doth not indeed directly prove, that the Scripture is in&s;pired, that the prophets and apo&s;tles, and the &s;everal books that go under their names were in&s;pired; but it proves Chri&s;t was what he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be, the &s;on of God: that the doctrine he preached was true; and that he had authority from heaven for all he did.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;tand to prove the certainty of this fact that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the dead. It has all the evi|dence that a thing of this nature is capable of. And I am con&s;ident, no rea&s;onable per&s;on can lay any
<PB N="227" REF="028262_0228_0FD7F634DC69E530">weight upon the &s;orry pretence of his enemies, the a&s;&s;idavit they hired the watch to make, viz. that <HI>while they &s;lept his di&s;ciples came and &s;tole him away.</HI> It was utterly unlikely, that the di&s;ciples &s;hould at|tempt &s;uch a thing. Next to impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould &s;ucceed in it: and be&s;ides the very pretence is &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Men a&s;leep, are as men ab&s;ent and at a di&s;tance, or even men &s;o far and &s;o long dead; and what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">edit is to be given to their te&s;timony? how cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey tell what was done when they were a&s;leep?</P>
<P>The&s;e, and the like, were the miracles by which the doctrines of the Bible were ratified and con|firmed. Mo&s;es, Chri&s;t, the apo&s;tles, and primitive chri&s;tians for &s;ome ages wrought miracles. I am now,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the force of the argument from hence, and to &s;hew how miracles prove the in&s;pir|ation or divine mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e that wrote the Scriptures. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. We find that miracles were wrought for this purpo&s;e, as an evidence of a divine commi&s;&s;ion, and accordingly appealed to. Thus when God ena|bled Mo&s;es to work miracles, he tells him it was that the I&s;raelites might believe the God of their fathers had appeared to him. And accordingly we &s;ee the miracles he wrought in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderne&s;s, were the great means, not only of e&s;tabli&s;hing his authority, but of vindi|cating it when called in que&s;tion. When Corah, Dathan, and Abiram mutinied again&s;t him, he has recour&s;e to miracles, as his credentials, and puts the deci&s;ion of the di&s;pute between him&s;elf and his competitors thereupon. <HI>Hereby,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye &s;hall know that the Lord hath &s;ent me: if the&s;e men die the common death of all men, or if they be vi&s;ited after the vi&s;itation of all men, then the Lord hath not &s;ent me

They appeal to miracles as God's witne&s;s to them. <HI>Believe me,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>for the work's &s;ake.</HI> And again, <HI>if I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had &s;in.</HI> The apo&s;tle Paul pleads for him&s;elf and in behalf of his mi&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>&s;igns of an apo&s;tle were wrought</HI> by him. And the evangeli&s;t remarks with reference to all the apo&s;tles, that <HI>they went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with &s;igns following.</HI> They preached in the name of the Lord, and he owned them by the pow|er of miracles that attended them.</P>
<P>I might here ob&s;erve that the famous impo&s;tor Mahomet, as he was defective in all other proofs of a divine mi&s;&s;ion, &s;o particularly in this. When &s;ome of his country-men that were aware of the vile de&s;igns he was carrying on, under the &s;pecious pretence of a call and revelation from heaven, &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e him, the more effectually to try and gravel him, they demanded he would &s;hew them &s;ome miracle. <Q>Mo&s;es, &s;ay they, and Je&s;us, and the re&s;t of the prophets, according to your own doctrine, wrought miracles to prove their mi&s;&s;ion from God. And therefore, if you be a prophet, and greater than any that were &s;ent be|fore you, as you boa&s;t your&s;elf, make the dead

Sometimes he in&s;inuated, that their predece&s;&s;ors contemned the miracles of Salek, and the other prophets, and that for this rea&s;on God would work no more among them. At other times he told them, that tho&s;e God had ordained to be|lieve, &s;hould believe without miracles, and that tho&s;e whom he had not ordained to believe, &s;hould not be convinced, though all the miracles they re|quired were wrought in their &s;ight. And when he found this would not &s;atisfy, he goes to work ano|ther way; takes up the &s;word and re&s;olves to make u&s;e of that as his only argument for the future.</P>
<P>But the writers of the Scripture, and tho&s;e that were employed in delivering to us the doctrines thereof, do not put us off with &s;uch flames and &s;orry pretences as the&s;e are. They do not de&s;ire we &s;hould believe them upon their bare word, but ap|peal to their works, the power of miracles they were intru&s;ted with, and exerci&s;ed as there was occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me ob&s;erve, that the miracles the&s;e per|&s;ons wrought, are certain evidences of a divine power concurring with them. It was the ju&s;t rea|&s;oning of Nichodemus, <HI>Rabbi, we know thou art a
<PB N="230" REF="028262_0231_0FD7F64630C90B50">teacher come from God; for no man can do the&s;e mi|racles that thou doe&s;t, except God be with him.</HI> A mi|racle &s;uppo&s;es the cour&s;e of nature &s;u&s;pended and altered, which can be done only by the author of nature: it is the finger of God, an operation of in|finite power, whoever may be the in&s;trument in it. The apo&s;tles <HI>went forth and preached the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;gel,</HI> &s;ays the evangeli&s;t, <HI>the Lord working with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and con|firming the word with &s;igns following.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> worked with them, or they had never wroug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> things they did. Now,</P>
<P N="3">3. I think the argument hence fully conclu&s;ive, that the&s;e per&s;ons were undoubtedly &s;ent of God. They wrought miracles, and that by a divine pow|er; and we may be &s;ure God would not lend his power, as I may expre&s;s it, to confirm an impo&s;ture. Had the per&s;ons we are &s;peaking of been cheats, forged the doctrine which they delivered to the world in the name of God, can we imagine that he would have concurred with them in the manner he did? have enabled them to &s;peak all &s;orts of lan|guages they had never learned, and that on pur|po&s;e that they might propagate and &s;pread the re|ligion they had contrived and forged; enabled them to heal all &s;orts of di&s;ea&s;es, and rai&s;e the dead, as we know they frequently did? would God have been thus pre&s;ent with cheats and impo&s;tors, that came to abu&s;e mankind in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner? would he have &s;upplied them with power for &s;uch a horrid purpo&s;e? we cannot &s;uppo&s;e this, without changing our ideas and notions of God, and de&s;|troying his e&s;&s;ential characters of wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the miracles wrought by Mo&s;es, the prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, are the &s;tronge&s;t proof and evidence that can be given, &s;o far as we know, of a divine mi&s;&s;ion. None ever did &s;uch works as they. And I reckon, when any come in
<PB N="231" REF="028262_0232_0FD7F6479FDA9A20">the name of God, with &s;uch a power accompanying them, mankind not only may receive them, but are under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing it; otherwi&s;e, they re|ject the te&s;timony of God, and oppo&s;e his authority.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay, for in&s;tance, of that great confirmation of the chri&s;tian religion, the re&s;urrec|tion of Chri&s;t? had he not ro&s;e from the dead, his religion had died with him. Whereas the miracle of his re&s;urrection is &s;uch a proof of his commi&s;&s;ion, as one would think the mo&s;t &s;tubborn infidel could not with&s;tand. Had he been an impo&s;tor, it is cer|tain, he could not have rai&s;ed him&s;elf. And can we &s;uppo&s;e, that God would have rai&s;ed him, that is, have employed his power, the exceeding great|ne&s;s of his power, to e&s;tabli&s;h a lie, and give credit to a cheat: no, all the notions we have of God oblige us to believe, that if Chri&s;t had not been the faithful witne&s;s, &s;ent and approved by him, he would never have given &s;o high a te&s;timony to him: but rather have withdrawn from him, and left the temple of his body, when it was de&s;troyed, to have lain in its ruins forever. I remember a pa&s;&s;age, which may &s;erve for the illu&s;tration of this argument, of an impo&s;tor, called El-David, that gave out he was the Chri&s;t, and drew many followers af|ter him. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s related by Maimon in a letter to the Jews at Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">illes. His pretences making a noi&s;e in that part of the world, he was brought before an Arabian prince, who a&s;ked him, <Q>what miracle he &s;hewed, that they might believe in him?</Q> He an&s;wered, "cut off my head, and I will live again." To which the prince replied, <Q>thou can&s;t not give us a greater &s;ign, and if it &s;o fall out, that thou do&s;t ri&s;e again to life after I have cut off thy head, I and all my people, nay, all the world &s;ure, will believe what thou &s;aye&s;t is true.</Q> And pre&s;ently the experiment was made. He com|maned him to be beheaded, and there was an end
<PB N="232" REF="028262_0233_0FD7F64915BE5478">of the cheat. But it was not thus with our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. He put the credit of all upon this one &s;in|gle event, and came off with glorious &s;ucce&s;s. He told them often he would ri&s;e again on the third day. Accordingly, he did &s;o at the time appoint|ed; triumphed over the grave, and was declared to be the Son of God with power thereby.</P>
<P>Now this miracle, and the others &s;o wonderfully &s;hewn in the mini&s;try of Mo&s;es and the prophets, of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, are &s;uch public autho|ritative vouchers for the per&s;ons concerned, that God acknowledged them, owned them, and &s;ent them; that their doctrine was true and divine; that nothing can be greater. It may be affirmed of all the re&s;t, what was &s;aid of Je&s;us of Nazareth, namely, that <HI>he was a man approved of God by mi|racles, wonders, and &s;igns, which God did by him.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible many objections may be and have been rai&s;ed again&s;t this doctrine; and it is granted, it is not without its difficulties. But as I am de|termined to ha&s;ten through this &s;ubject as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, I mu&s;t not enter upon the con&s;ideration of the&s;e things, which would not only require more time than I have for them; but it may be, more attention and judgment, than I can promi&s;e my&s;elf from the generality of the auditory. In the mean time, I hope none will think this is an eva&s;ion, and that I am willing to pa&s;s over objections, becau&s;e I know not what to &s;ay to them. I can truly de|clare, I know no difficulty, that may not ea&s;ily be removed; no objection again&s;t miracles, that doth in the lea&s;t invalidate, and di&s;able the argument from them. As an in&s;tance of this, though I can|not now &s;tay to examine all the objections, or cavils that are brought in upon this account, I &s;hall how|ever mention the chief and &s;tronge&s;t of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is objected, that we do not under&s;tand the extent of created powers; do not &s;o well compre|hend
<PB N="233" REF="028262_0234_0FD7F64A9FD79C80">the philo&s;ophy of nature, as to determine what is a miracle, according to the common defini|tion of it, that is, what is contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed cour&s;e and laws of nature, what can or cannot be done by any finite being, men or angels. Con|&s;equently, &s;hould it be granted, that God only can work a miracle, yet if a cheat can do &s;uch things, as no &s;kill of ours is &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h from a real miracle, we are left under the &s;ame difficulty; a miracle can be no &s;atisfactory proof of a divine mi&s;&s;ion: &s;ince an impo&s;tor can perform things &s;o like miracles, that we know them not from miracles.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tronge&s;t objection, that I know, again&s;t the doctrine, and I have given it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. In an&s;wer to it,</P>
<P N="1">1. I grant, that created beings, evil &s;pirits for in&s;tance, may do a great many &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing things. We find juglers among men, can by mere legerdemain, perform feats that puzzle the nice&s;t ob&s;ervers. And no que&s;tion, the devil can do far greater things. He under&s;tands more &s;ecrets in nature, than the mo&s;t &s;kilful philo&s;ophers or phy&s;i|cians do, the virtues of natural means, and knows when and how to apply them with more advantage; and con&s;equently may be allowed to perform, what may be to us utterly unaccountable; what we may think above the powers of nature, though it may not be &s;o. But then we mu&s;t con&s;ider for what pur|po&s;e the&s;e things are done, in what manner they are done, and what other evidences of divinity go along with them. We are to attend to the cir|cum&s;tances of &s;uch &s;igns and wonders, that we are now &s;uppo&s;ing may po&s;&s;ibly be done by wicked &s;pi|rits; and thence make a judgment of them, which we may not be qualified to make, upon the mere contemplation of the facts them&s;elves. But I add,</P>
<P N="2">2. That no powers but tho&s;e that were divine, ever performed &s;uch things as we have recorded in
<PB N="234" REF="028262_0235_0FD7F64E8795AE50">Scripture. Neither men nor devils ever wrought wonders any thing parallel to the miracles there related, or that de&s;erve to be compared with them. Suppo&s;e any could give the color of wine to water, make it look like wine: did ever any turn a great quantity of water into real wine, into the more ge|nerous &s;ort thereof, as our Lord did at the marri|age of Cana in Galilee. <HI>Thou ha&s;t kept the good wine till now,</HI> &s;aith the governor of the fea&s;t, &s;peak|ing of the wine to which Chri&s;t had miraculou&s;ly converted the water. Suppo&s;ing any could by magic, or the devil by his own power, could calm the &s;ea; yet, who ever knew this done by a word &s;peaking? Suppo&s;ing a per&s;on of &s;kill could open the eyes of the blind; yet to do this as Chri&s;t did, by clay and &s;pittle, is a thing unknown in the world. Who ever attempted to &s;peak a dead man into life, or call him out of his grave? What virtue has a <HI>Lazarus come forth!</HI> to commend back a departed &s;pirit, and re-unite it to its b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y? Life cannot be re&s;tored, but by the author of life; at lea&s;t we have no in&s;tances of any power effectual for this purpo&s;e, but the divine power: nor do we find it was ever delegated to impo&s;tors, or put forth by evil &s;pirits, on any occa&s;ion. Di&s;ea&s;es may be cured by natur|al means, and the proper u&s;e of medicines. But our Lord cured all &s;orts of di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;ome have ob&s;erved, &s;uch as were naturally incurable. A learned Phy&s;ician has wrote a book to prove this. And he cured them without medicines, or waiting the lei&s;ure of nature; only by &s;peaking a word: and &s;ometimes when the patient was at a great di&s;|tance. How &s;urp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">zing that, <HI>he &s;tood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately &s;he aro&s;e and mini&s;tred to them?</HI></P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, how do we know but &s;pirits, and an|gels may do as much? I an&s;wer by a&s;king another que&s;tion, whether God de&s;igned to pre&s;cribe a di&s;|tinction
<PB N="235" REF="028262_0236_0FD7F64F37B46040">between created and uncreated power? between his own power and that of his creatures? if not, how &s;hould he govern the world? at lea&s;t, how &s;hould he make him&s;elf known in the govern|ment of it, &s;ince we cannot di&s;cern his works from tho&s;e of his creatures? In a word, though I will not take upon me to &s;ay, how far the power of this or that creature, of angels, good or bad, may go; and to fix the preci&s;e bounds between the divine power, and that of &s;econd cau&s;es: yet I think it no pre&s;umption to affirm, there are many things creatures cannot do; and that the miracles we have an account of in Scripture, both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, are of this &s;ort. They cannot by a rod, or &s;tick, &s;top &s;treams of water, and make them &s;tand up like a wall. They cannot command water out of a rock; make the ground open and &s;wal|low up a company of men; rebuke fevers and o|ther di&s;tempers, and make them depart immediate|ly. They cannot make a man that has been dead four days ri&s;e out of his grave by only calling upon him, and bidding him come forth. They cannot &s;ay to a cripple, that has been lame from his mo|ther's womb, ri&s;e and walk, and thereby re&s;tore him, as Peter did. The&s;e and the like works are &s;uch in&s;tances of power, &s;uch inroads upon the e&s;|tabli&s;hed laws and cour&s;e of nature, and &s;o much above any capacity that &s;econd cau&s;es are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, &s;o far as we know; that we can a&s;cribe them to none, but the author of nature, and great Lord of the world. I an&s;wer once more,</P>
<P N="3">3. Whatever may be po&s;&s;ible to created beings, it is certain, they can do nothing without God: and I think it demon&s;trable from the divine perfec|tions; his wi&s;dom, truth, goodne&s;s; that he will never &s;uffer them to delude mankind by &s;uch works of power, as tho&s;e recorded in Scripture, employed
<PB N="236" REF="028262_0237_0FD7F65947458AB0">to confirm fal&s;ehood and lies. Suppo&s;e Satan and his accomplices could heal the fick, and rai&s;e the dead; which yet, I am per&s;uaded, none will un|dertake to prove they can, in the manner that the&s;e things were performed by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. I a&s;k, for what purpo&s;e they did this? If the Scrip|ture be true, and they hereby meant to e&s;tabli&s;h it, it makes them take part again&s;t them&s;elves, repre|&s;ents Satan as divided again&s;t Satan, and ruining his own kingdom. If the Scripture be fal&s;e, and they concurred with the writers of it to give credit to their fictions; this mu&s;t be done, at lea&s;t, by divine permi&s;&s;ion. It &s;uppo&s;es the great and wi&s;e go|vernor of the world &s;tanding by, and not only &s;o, but I think, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, every one mu&s;t own permitting; while the devil and wicked men, his in&s;truments, abu&s;ed the name of God, and impo&s;ed on mankind in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner; performing &s;uch things as none in the world can di&s;tingui&s;h from the works of God; and yet all is let pa&s;s without any inter|po&s;ition of providence to di&s;cover the cheat. This I think not con&s;i&s;tent with an acknowledgment, that God governs the world, and with tho&s;e attri|butes and perfections of his that are in&s;eparable from his nature and government.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is farther objected that impo&s;tors have wrought miracles, Appollonius Tyanoeus particu|larly, and the magicians in Egypt that with&s;tood Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, as to the fir&s;t, we have no good evi|dence of the truth by the facts alledged. What is related by Philo&s;tratus is manife&s;tly of very doubt|ful credit. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e pretended miracles were few, ob&s;cure, and in no re&s;pect to be compared with tho&s;e we have in the Scripture. As to the magicians in Egypt, &s;uppo&s;ing they were real mira|cles, which yet it is not nece&s;&s;ary to grant, nor, &s;o far as I know, is it nece&s;&s;ary to deny that they were.
<PB N="237" REF="028262_0238_0FD7F65CE68A2E30">But &s;uppo&s;ing they were, they are no di&s;paragement to the miracles of Mo&s;es, and others in the Scrip|ture. The ca&s;e I take to be this: there was a trial of &s;kill, as I may &s;ay, between Mo&s;es and the&s;e men, Mo&s;es works &s;everal miracles before them. God is plea&s;ed for the proving of Pharaoh, or for other purpo&s;es and ends known to him&s;elf, to en|able them to do the like: but then, exerts a &s;upe|rior power, by his &s;ervant Mo&s;es, and &s;o triumphs over them. He fir&s;t &s;ent them his power and then withdrew from them, leaving them to manife&s;t their weakne&s;s and fraud. For after the &s;pecimens they gave, they were nonplu&s;&s;ed, and could proceed no farther. So that the i&s;&s;ue of this conte&s;t was the defeat of the&s;e pretenders; their conviction of a divine power with Mo&s;es, and I may add, the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of Mo&s;es's authority. God left the magi|cians, &s;uppo&s;ing they acted before by his power, continued to a&s;&s;i&s;t and own Mo&s;es; and thereby declared whom he had cho&s;en. And as Mo&s;es was hereby confirmed in his office, and had his com|mi&s;&s;ion &s;ealed from heaven, &s;o it was with the re&s;t of the writers of Scripture: God bore te&s;timony to them by miracles. But I ha&s;ten to another point.</P>
<P N="3">3. God bore te&s;timony to the penmen of Scrip|ture, and to tho&s;e that were the in&s;truments and means of the revelation it contains, by prophecy. Some|thing has been offered on this head, when I &s;poke of the accompli&s;hment of Scripture; and I have at pre&s;ent only room for &s;hort hints. The &s;ubject is copious and important; but I &s;hall confine my|&s;elf. Any one that conver&s;es with his Bible will &s;ee how much it runs in a prophetic &s;train, it a|bounds with prophecies; and divine providence has &s;hewn us the accompli&s;hment of them: there by proving, I think, the in&s;piration I am pleading for. Give me leave to mention a few in&s;tances out of many.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="028262_0239_0FD7F65E29CF4AF8">
It was prophe&s;ied and foretold, that Abraham &s;hould become a great nation; that God would multiply his &s;eed, even as the <HI>&s;tars of heaven,</HI> and as the <HI>du&s;t of the earth;</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed. And it is to be ob&s;erved, at the time of this a&s;&s;urance given him, Abraham had no child, nor had rea&s;on in an ordinary way to expect any.

This was foretold, Gen. xv. and in other places. How it was accompli&s;hed, you read in the book of Exodus. I will only ob|&s;erve, that God not only vi&s;ited his people, and vi|&s;ited their enemies with his judgments, according to his word; but kept day with them: <HI>it came to pa&s;s,</HI> &s;ays Mo&s;es, <HI>at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the &s;elf-&s;ame day it came to pa&s;s, that all the ho&s;ts of I&s;rael went out from the land of Egypt.</HI></P>

<P>Jacob foretold the &s;ettlement of the tribes in the promi&s;ed land, and in a prophetic map, as I may call it, repre&s;ented their &s;everal conditions there; where they &s;hould be fixed; what their &s;tate &s;hould be; and what changes they &s;hould undergo.

<P>As their captivity, &s;o their return from captivity, with the time and circum&s;tances thereof, was fore|told: that God would deliver them up into the hands of their enemies for their &s;ins, and afterwards bring them back and re&s;tore them.

<P>The ri&s;e, continuance and fall of the four fa|mous monarchies, the A&s;&s;yrian, Medo-Per&s;ian, Grecian and Roman, was exactly foretold by Dani|el; the heads of the&s;e monarchies de&s;cribed, and the great events and revolutions under them re|pre&s;ented, as if the prophet had been an hi&s;torian, and had written after the things were come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>A great many things were foretold concerning particular per&s;ons, which were verified in the even. Thus Jo&s;iah was prophe&s;ied of by name
<PB N="240" REF="028262_0241_0FD7F66115BD00A0">above three hundred years before he was born, that he &s;hould execute the judgment of God upon the altar at Bethel, which Jeroboam had &s;et up, and upon the prie&s;ts that officiated there, 1 Kings xiii. 2. This was fulfilled, as you &s;ee, 2 Kings xxiii. 15. Cyrus was prophe&s;ied of by name above a hundred years before he was born, as the per&s;on that &s;hould re&s;tore the Jews and rebuild the tem|ple, I&s;a. xliv. 28. There are a great many won|derful and unlikely things in this prophecy; as in|deed in all the re&s;t, could I here enquire into them: as, that his birth &s;hould be foretold &s;o long before; his name given him; that he &s;hould conquer &s;o potent a monarchy as that of Babylon; and that though an heathen, he &s;hould favor and re&s;tore a religion his predece&s;&s;ors had &s;et them&s;elves to cru&s;h and ruin. This could proceed only from him that knows all things, and to whom future things are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We have a glorious collection of prophecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; the illu&s;trating of which would more than require a di&s;cour&s;e by it&s;elf, and fully prove what is &s;aid, that the <HI>te&s;timony of Je&s;us is the &s;pirit of prophecy.</HI> It was foretold of him, that he &s;hould be the &s;eed of a woman, born of a virgin, which was accordingly fulfilled: that he &s;hould be the &s;eed of Abraham and of David, born at Bethle|hem, and brought out of Egypt. In &s;hort, mo&s;t of the circum&s;tances of his life, his &s;ufferings, his death and re&s;urrection, the oppo&s;ition he would meet with, the &s;ucce&s;s of his doctrine, and the like, were foretold: every iota and tittle of which pre|dictions was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I add, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were di&s;tingui&s;hed with the &s;ame &s;pirit of prophecy, and foretold a great many wonderful events, which the chri&s;tian church has &s;een take place in the way and manner de&s;cribed. Thus Chri&s;t foretold his own death
<PB N="241" REF="028262_0242_0FD7F665A7C3D328">with the circum&s;tances thereof; that all his di&s;ciples &s;hould for&s;ake him; that one of them &s;hould betray him: and this he &s;ignified when none of them had any &s;u&s;picion concerning the traitor; nor the traitor, it is likely, any &s;u&s;pi|cion concerning him&s;elf. He foretold the man|ner of his death, and his re&s;urrection, with the time of it. He foretold that tho&s;e who believed in his name, &s;hould work miracles, &s;peak with tongues, heal di&s;ea&s;es, and ca&s;t out devils. How punctual|ly this was accompli&s;hed, the hi&s;tory of the New-Te&s;tament, and the mo&s;t primitive writings of the church inform us. Nor were the&s;e extraordinary gifts confined to the apo&s;tolical ages; but were common in the ages next &s;ucceeding. <Q>To re&s;tore to health, &s;ays Irenaeus,* by impo&s;ition of hands, to cure the weak, the lame and paralitic, and tho&s;e that labor under any other malady, is a thing frequent in the church.</Q> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e Origen.&dagger; <Q>We have &s;een, &s;aith he, people freed from a thou&s;and dreadful &s;ymptoms and ca|lamities, from which neither men nor devils could recover them, by the invocation of Chri&s;t's name.</Q> And for the ca&s;ting out of devils, the fathers over and over again mention it in their apo|logies, as a thing confe&s;&s;ed by their adver&s;aries. They appeal to their con&s;ciences and knowledge, and tell them that many hundreds were &s;till living of their own &s;uper&s;tition as well as chri&s;tian pro&s;e|lytes, who by their per&s;onal experience could at|te&s;t it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t foretold the preaching of his doctrine through the world, that there &s;hould ari&s;e fal&s;e prophets, and fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, that &s;hould come in his name and deceive many, which accordingly was fulfilled. He foretold the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem,
<PB N="242" REF="028262_0243_0FD7F66F518C7A38">and the temple; the &s;igns and prodigies that &s;hould go before it, the calamities that &s;hould at|tend it; and that the de&s;truction &s;hould be total and final; that there &s;hould not be le&s;t one &s;tone upon another that &s;hould not be thrown down; that Jeru&s;alem &s;hould be trodden down, and the Jews led captives into all nations. How this has been fulfilled the world has &s;een. And was I not now in ha&s;te to get through the &s;ubject, it would be no &s;mall plea&s;ure to &s;hew you the exact parallel be|tween the prophecy and providence, the prediction and the event. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the Jews have often attempted to rebuild their temple, though in vain. The la&s;t attempt was by Julian the apo&s;tate, who out of &s;pite to Chri&s;t, and to de|feat the prediction, gave orders for rebuilding it; but was baffled by the immediate hand of heaven. The &s;tory is related by &s;everal, particularly by Ammianus Marcellinus, an heathen who lived at that time. He tells us, that Julian endeavored to rebuild the temple at Jeru&s;alem, and gave it in charge to one Aliprius of Antioch, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the governor of the province, and a va&s;t trea&s;ure by the Emperor to ha&s;ten and promote the work. But, he adds, they were &s;oon forced to de&s;i&s;t from the enterpri&s;e, by balls of fire i&s;&s;uing from the founda|tion, which terrified and de&s;troyed the per&s;ons employed therein. So much authority was there in the&s;e prophecies, that God would not &s;uffer men or devils to interpo&s;e and &s;lur them, or by any acts and powers of theirs, hinder their accompli&s;hment. And how &s;trong an argument is this of the divine mi&s;&s;ion and in&s;piration of the per&s;ons by who&s;e mi|ni&s;try we have the Scripture doctrine and revelation. They had the &s;eal of miracles as you have heard, and the &s;eal of prophecy, a demon&s;tration that God was with them, and had &s;ent them. In the one in|&s;tance he lent them his power, in the other his

<P>Let me farther remark, that the &s;pirit of pro|phecy that runs through the Scripture concerns generally &s;uch things, &s;uch events, as depended wholly upon the will of God, and the will of free agents, which could not be known at that di&s;tance by any but God him&s;elf, and tho&s;e to whom he was plea&s;ed to reveal them. Who could foretel, for in&s;tance, that there &s;hould be a man born called Cyrus, &s;o long beforehand? that he &s;hould conquer Babylon, that he &s;hould have it in his heart to re&s;|tore the Jews and rebuild their city? There were no natural cau&s;es then exi&s;ting of &s;uch an event: nor could any fore&s;ee it but the infinite all-com|prehending mind, who has the whole tract of time and &s;eries of events under his eye at once, and to whom all his works are known from the beginning to the end. In &s;hort, to foretel future events is the prerogative of God. Hence we find him triumph|ing over idols upon this account; <HI>Let them &s;hew us what &s;hall happen,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hew the former things what they be, and &s;hew the things that are to come here|after, that we may know that ye are Gods.</HI> Intimating, that to be able to fore&s;ee and po&s;itively declare events and occurrences of things merely contingent, that depend on the will of man, or the plea&s;ure of God; to declare the&s;e at a great di&s;tance of time before they come to pa&s;s, argues divinity, or at lea&s;t, &s;pecial communion with and in&s;truction from the divine mind, who from his throne views and takes a pro&s;pect of all time, and has all events placed in order before him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now con&s;ider the objections that may be offered from diviners, the heathen oracles, and the like. It is known there was &s;o much uncer|tainty in their an&s;wers, as very much di&s;graced them

<HEAD>DISCOURSE X. THE INSPIRATION OF THE SCRIPTURE PRO|VED, AND THE CANON OF SCRIPTURE VIN|DICATED.</HEAD>

<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I AM arguing the divinity or in&s;piration of the Scripture from the te&s;timony that God gave to the penmen thereof. I have already con&s;idered the two remarkable in&s;tances of miracles and pro|phecy, and now go on to another particular.</P>
<P N="3">III. God bore te&s;timony to the writers of the Bible by the &s;preading of their doctrine, and the mighty &s;ucce&s;s it had in the world. I mu&s;t here premi&s;e, that it is the chri&s;tian religion, or doctrine of the New Te&s;tament, that this argument chiefly re&s;pects. The revelation God made to the Jews was very much confined to them&s;elves. Not that others were wholly excluded. They admitted pro|&s;elytes, and taught their religion to them. But there was not that general communication made to the world, as after the coming of Chri&s;t. When the partition-wall was broken down, and the inclo|&s;ure God &s;et about his ancient people was laid open. The apo&s;tles had a commi&s;&s;ion in the large&s;t terms to go and preach the go&s;pel to every creature, and pro&s;elyte all nations. God de&s;igned the revelation, he made to the world by the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t and
<PB N="246" REF="028262_0247_0FD7F676D80A24F0">the apo&s;tles, &s;hould be univer&s;al for the u&s;e of all mankind that would receive it. And it is this part of the divine revelation that my pre&s;ent argument peculiarly relates to, the &s;ucce&s;s and &s;preading of the go&s;pel, the doctrine and religion of the New-Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Though I may further premi&s;e, that if the argu|ment from hence be good with re&s;pect to one part, it doth by con&s;equence prove the whole Scripture to be divine. For the New Te&s;tament confirms the Old, as I ob&s;erved before. If Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were &s;ent of God, it is certain Mo&s;es and the prophets were &s;o too; for the former bear te&s;timony to the latter. Let me add, I do not lay the &s;tre&s;s of the argument upon the mere &s;preading of their doctrine, but on the manner and circum|&s;tances of it. Having premi&s;ed the&s;e things, I &s;hall &s;et the argument before you in a few particulars without enlargement.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a certain and known thing that the chri&s;|tian religion had the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s when fir&s;t preached, and was &s;pread through a great part of the world in a little time. This appears from the ancient mounuments of the church; from the te&s;timony of friends, and acknowledgment of ene|mies. Tertullian tells the Roman &s;enate, that though the chri&s;tians were but of ye&s;terday, yet they had filled all places and offices, that they were &s;trong enough to ma&s;ter the Roman empire; nay, that &s;o great were their numbers, that if they &s;hould but agree to retire out of it, the world would wonder at its own &s;olitude. And in his book again&s;t the Jews, he &s;ays, <Q>the chri&s;tian religion had enlarged its conque&s;ts beyond tho&s;e of the Roman empire, and had &s;ubdued tho&s;e places that were inacce&s;&s;i|ble to their armies.</Q> Pliny takes notice in his letter to the emperor concerning the chri&s;tians, that <Q>there were &s;uch multitudes of them, that the
<PB N="247" REF="028262_0248_0FD7F67B259F4960">temples and &s;acrifices of the gods were almo&s;t for&s;aken.</Q> Tacitus &s;peaks of an immen&s;e num|ber, even in Nero's time, the very fir&s;t age of chri&s;tianity. In &s;hort, the prevalency of the chri&s;|tian religion was &s;uch, that it gave occa&s;ion to the heathens to call it, "the powerful and prevailing &s;ect." Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2. Did it prevail among the vulgar only, but among the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive and learned. All &s;orts of per&s;ons, Jews, Gentiles, the ignorant and un|taught, and even the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, embra|ced chri&s;tianity. Indeed, its &s;ucce&s;s then, and ever after, has been mo&s;tly with per&s;ons of a lower &s;tation in the world. But there have always been &s;ome of the greate&s;t name that have owned and e&s;|pou&s;ed it. It was &s;o, particularly, at the fir&s;t plant|ing of it. I might give a large catalogue of philo&s;o|phers and men of &s;ame for learning that came into the church, and employed all their abilities in the &s;ervice of the chri&s;tian cau&s;e. Ju&s;tin Martyr be|fore he became a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, was conver&s;ant with all the &s;ects of the philo&s;ophers, and was at la&s;t a zealous Platoni&s;t; but left all to follow Je&s;us, and upon his acquaintance with the doctrine of Chri&s;t, profe&s;&s;es, that he &s;ound that to be the only &s;ure and profitable philo&s;ophy. Origen, another father in the chri&s;tian church, was in &s;o great fame for his learning, that even after he profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf a chri&s;tian, many of the philo&s;ophers attended his lectures at Alexandria, and &s;ome of them dedi|cated their books to him. It is &s;aid of Flotinus, a famous Platoni&s;t, that while he was reading lectures, di&s;covering Origen among his auditors, he blu&s;hed and was da&s;hed with &s;o great a pre&s;ence, &s;o as to break off abruptly. I might in&s;tance in a great many more of con&s;iderable reputation for their learning; but I forbear. All that I mention the&s;e things for, is to ob&s;erve to you, that as the chri&s;tian
<PB N="248" REF="028262_0249_0FD7F67C565EB328">religion was propagated through the world in a little time, &s;o &s;ome of the greate&s;t men, per&s;ons of the highe&s;t name for wi&s;dom and knowledge, be|came pro&s;elytes to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ucce&s;s that attended the go&s;pel in its fir&s;t publication was the more remarkable and glorious, I might &s;ay, divine, on the account of the mighty difficulties it had to encounter, and which it &s;ur|mounted. Had I time to pur&s;ue this argument, and to illu&s;trate it with &s;uch particulars, as might be in&s;i&s;ted upon, it would amount to a &s;ort of a demon|&s;tration, that the chri&s;tian religion is of God. For in&s;tance, to give a few hints, it had the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices of mankind, of Jews and Gentiles, to overcome.</P>
<P>Among other prejudices among the Jews, there were three that &s;tood directly in the way of the go&s;pel, and that were &s;o deeply rooted that I cannot &s;ee any power, le&s;s than divine, could ever have conquered them.</P>
<P>One of them was, that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould appear with the character of a &s;overeign earthly prince, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to deliver them from their enemies, re&s;tore the kingdom of David at Jeru&s;a|lem, and there reign in great &s;plendor and power over the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; the re&s;t of the world be|ing in a great mea&s;ure &s;ubject to their nation. This was the notion they had formed to them&s;elves of their Me&s;&s;iah and it &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es their minds, as Maimonides, one of their own rabbies, informs us.</P>
<P>It was another of their prejudices, that their law &s;hould abide for ever; that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be &s;o far from abrogating, that he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h it; and that the glory of his kingdom &s;hould chief|ly con&s;i&s;t in the exact performance of the legal wor&s;hip. The forementioned Maimonides, tells us this &s;hall belong to his office, whenever he comes; to rebuild the temple, and gather the di&s;per&s;ed of
<PB N="249" REF="028262_0250_0FD7DADD31475B40">I&s;rael; to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the legal rites and Con&s;titu|tions; to re&s;tore &s;acrifices, the &s;abbatical years and jubilees, according to every precept delivered in the law.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o an opinion among them, that had got hold of every mind, that the Jews only &s;hould par|take of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. The Gentiles they accounted as dogs, unholy and unclean; and we find in a multitude of places in the New Te&s;tament, they could not bear the thoughts of their calling and admi&s;&s;ion to an equal &s;tate and equal priviledges with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As for the heathens, they had prejudices too many to be here enumerated; and which were like mountains in the way of the chri&s;tian religion. The gods they wor&s;hipped in this or that country, the rites with which they wor&s;hipped them, and all the forms of their religion were become venerable with them by a pretended antiquity. And &s;o much were they in&s;laved to antiquity and tradition, that even the famous Tully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do Natura Deorum; l. 3.</NOTE> introduces Cotta as think|ing the plea thereof &s;ufficient to &s;upply the want of all other arguments, and to give a &s;anction to e|very thing that had obtained among them; <HI>this alone will be &s;ufficient for me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that our fore-fathers have thus handed it down to us.</HI></P>
<P>I will only ob&s;erve, be&s;ides the influence of e|ducation and cu&s;tom, and the &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection, that hereby they were brought into, to their reli|gion; there were two things in it, that gave it a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts. It was pompous, and had a glorious exterior, and was calculated to gratify their fle&s;hly inclinations.</P>
<P>Now let it be con&s;idered that before chri&s;tianity could get any footing in the world, all the&s;e pre|judices mu&s;t be removed. The Jews mu&s;t quit
<PB N="250" REF="028262_0251_0FD7F684D8223130">their darling notions of a temporal Me&s;&s;iah, and believe in a crucified Saviour: the pagans re|nounce the gods of their countries, the e&s;tabli&s;hed rites of their religion; the maxims they had receiv|ed by tradition from their fathers; and which was a further difficulty, renounce their beloved lu&s;ts. Upon the&s;e terms chri&s;tianity was preached to the world, and with all the&s;e di&s;advantages did it pre|vail and triumph.</P>
<P>I might &s;hew, that it had, not only the prejudi|ces of mankind again&s;t it, but human laws, and all the power and learning of the world. The <HI>kings of the earth and rulers</HI> of the people <HI>&s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord and again&s;t his Anointed.</HI> The hea|then philo&s;ophers, the Jewi&s;h doctors, with all the authority of the greate&s;t emperors, were united a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t and chri&s;tianity, and yet it prevails, thou&s;ands and myriads bow the knee to the holy Je&s;us, and profe&s;s them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of a cru|cified ma&s;ter. I am per&s;uaded you will not put me upon proving there mu&s;t be the finger of God in this &s;ucce&s;s. Let me ob&s;erve again,</P>
<P N="4">4. The doctrine of the go&s;pel in it&s;elf had a great deal in it to incumber it, and ob&s;truct its &s;ucce&s;s. It was built upon the utter ruin of the heathen re|ligion; declared the Jewi&s;h religion void and an|tiquated, and decently laid it in its grave. It o|verturns all the forms of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition the world was &s;o fond of; calls from pageantry to &s;implicity; and from loo&s;ene&s;s and fle&s;hly indul|gence to the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and purity. Some of its doctrines were not a little &s;hocking to the rea&s;on of mankind, as it was at that time trained up, and blinded by inveterate prejudices. As for in&s;tance, &s;alvation by a crucified chri&s;t; this was the great fundamental point of the go&s;pel, and we know what entertainment it met with in the world: it was <HI>to the Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bling-block, and to the Greeks
<PB N="251" REF="028262_0252_0FD7F6894C741858">fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> Pardon of &s;in, ju&s;tification and life, by the death and righteou&s;ne&s;s of another per&s;on, the re&s;urrection of the body, &amp;c. To &s;ay nothing of the duties pre&s;cribed in the chri&s;tian religion, as humility, meekne&s;s, &s;elf-denial, forgiving and lov|ing enemies, and the like: the&s;e were things that lay cro&s;s in the minds of men, mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the great maxims of wi&s;dom e&s;tabli&s;hed among the phi|lo&s;ophers, and promi&s;ed no kind reception to the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be remarked here, that in&s;tead of honors, preferment, and temporal advantages; it ever &s;peaks of contempt, &s;ufferings and per&s;ecution, as the lot and portion of them that embrace it. Now, that &s;uch a doctrine as this &s;hould obtain in the world, bear down all oppo&s;ition, gain pro&s;elytes without number among both Jews and Gentiles, is an event that, I think, it is impo&s;&s;ible to account for without having recour&s;e to a divine hand. E&s;|pecially, if I add,</P>
<P N="5">5. That the in&s;truments of this great work were low, mean, and contemptible per&s;ons. You know the character of the apo&s;tles, and I need not in&s;i&s;t upon it. The founder of our religion &s;ent forth not twelve princes or philo&s;ophers, but twelve fi&s;h|ermen; men de&s;titute of all human advantages, void of learning, arts, language, reputation, power, and authority: the&s;e receive a commi&s;&s;ion from him. And what was it to do? why, to teach all nations and convert the world. Now you will plea&s;e to remember what your Bible tells you, and what is confirmed by the mo&s;t authentic records of the church, that the&s;e per&s;ons went forth, twelve poor fi&s;hermen, preaching the go&s;pel in the name of Chri&s;t. And in a few years they overturn Sa|tan's empire, &s;ilence his oracles, baffle all the phi|lo&s;ophy of the heathens, and cavils of the Jews;
<PB N="252" REF="028262_0253_0FD7F68AEA73A148">and &s;ubdue a great part of the world to their Lord and ma&s;ter. I leave every one to make the infer|ence from hence which I de&s;ign, viz. that God ap|proved them, that it was his doctrine they publi&s;hed, that he &s;ent them, and was with them. The whole hi&s;tory of their proceedings, I think, demon&s;trates this.</P>
<P>Two things are evident concerning them, to men|tion no more, viz. that they had a &s;upernatural cou|rage, otherwi&s;e they would not have undertaken the work. Suppo&s;e twelve mechanics, among us, &s;hould now be &s;ent by any to go into Turky or Per|&s;ia, and convert the Mahometans, can we imagine that men in their &s;en&s;es would engage in &s;uch an enterpri&s;e? they might object they wanted &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, they wanted a guard to &s;ecure them from danger; they could not &s;peak the language of the country; nor was it likely they &s;hould have any other reception, but to be in&s;ulted and &s;acrificed for their impertinency. The like objections might ri&s;e in the minds of the fir&s;t preachers of the go&s;pel, had they not known they were called of God; had they not received power and courage from on high. Nor would they have per&s;i&s;ted in their enterpri&s;e, as they did, through all &s;orts of terrors and deaths, had not God been with them, and &s;tood by them, &s;trengthening them <HI>by his &s;pirit, with might in the inner man.</HI></P>
<P>Further, it is evident, had not God &s;ent them, and owned them, they could never have &s;ucceeded in the manner they did, and under the difficulties they met with. So that I reckon I may conclude with good authority, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the chri&s;ti|an religion is a &s;trong argument, that it is divine. And if &s;o, the Scriptures mu&s;t have a divine origi|nal.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible it may be objected, that the impo&s;|ture of Mahomet has &s;pread over a great part of
<PB N="253" REF="028262_0254_0FD7F68BF066B388">the world. But I &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;hew this does not at all weaken the force of my argument. The ca&s;e of the one is no way parallel with the other. Though, as I determine now to conclude the proofs I de&s;ign to mention of the in&s;piration of the Bible, I &s;hall defer the con&s;ideration of this objection taken from the &s;preading of Mahometani&s;m, till I &s;peak to the objections in general; and ha&s;ten to another par|ticular.</P>
<P N="4">IV. God bore te&s;timony to the writers of the Scripture, by the glorious effects thereof upon the hearts of men, in their con&s;tant &s;anctification. This is a &s;tanding proof of the truth of chri&s;tianity, and indeed of the truth and divinity of the Bible. And as it is an argument that every chri&s;tian, ho un|&s;kilful and unlearned &s;oever he may be, may un|der&s;tand, and which he carries in his own brea&s;t, it well de&s;erves to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered. I &s;hall only at pre&s;ent take notice, that the chri&s;tian reli|gion, wherever it came and was heartily embraced, wrought a very glorious change. As it teaches to deny ungodline&s;s, and wordly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world; pre&s;crib|ing the mo&s;t exact rules of holy living. So it was attended with an inward power and efficacy; &s;ub|duing the minds of men to a conformity to tho&s;e rules. This was eminently &s;een in the fir&s;t ages of the go&s;pel <Q>&s;hew me a drunkard, &s;ays one of the fathers, &s;hew me a pa&s;&s;ionate man, one that is lu&s;tful; and with a few words of God, I will make him &s;ober, calm, temperate, cha&s;te, &amp;c.</Q> Such was the divine energy and virtue that generally went along with the go&s;pel at that time. And though we have rea&s;on to lament it, that the word of God has not &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and vi&s;ible an effect upon tho&s;e that profe&s;s chri&s;tianity now, as it &s;eems then it had; yet &s;till the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is the <HI>power of God to &s;alvation to every one that believeth.</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="028262_0255_0FD7F68DA98D67C8">God &s;till owns it as his in&s;trument in renewing the minds of men; and thereby gives te&s;timony to his word. But as this is a te&s;timony of the highe&s;t im|portance, and what tends not a little to confirm chri&s;tians of every &s;ort in the behalf of their Bible, I &s;hall re&s;ume it upon another occa&s;ion; and therefore now di&s;mi&s;s it without any farther en|largement.</P>
<P>There is one thing more I &s;hall &s;ubjoin, as the la&s;t argument I intend to offer of the in&s;piration of the Scripture.</P>
<P N="5">V. That all this evidence is &s;trengthened and confirmed by the gro&s;s ab&s;urdities that attend the &s;cheme of unbelievers, who deny the truth and di|vinity of the Bible. They alledge and object difficul|ties in believing the Scripture; and yet they them|&s;elves believe again&s;t Scripture with far more diffi|culties in their way. This might be &s;hewn in a great many in&s;tances. I &s;hall mention and touch upon a few. As,</P>
<P>That God notwith&s;tanding, the confe&s;&s;ed bounty and goodne&s;s of his nature, and his gracious and merciful inclinations towards mankind; &s;hould yet &s;uffer them to remain under their pre&s;ent darkne&s;s, ignorance, and prejudices, without affording them any &s;upernatural revelation. That mankind need a revelation from heaven, I have at large proved. I have proved, that if the Bible be not that revela|tion, there is no &s;uch thing in the world. So that this is one ab&s;urdity that attends their &s;cheme, who reject the authority of the Scriptures, that God has given no revelation of him&s;elf to the world.</P>
<P>Another is, that a book &s;hould be offered to mankind, atte&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as the Bible is, &s;o full of &s;trong evidence, and yet be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, That &s;o great a part of the world, the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t part of the world, &s;hould he under a delu&s;ion for &s;o many ages; embracing the Scrip|ture
<PB N="255" REF="028262_0256_0FD7F69020740B60">as a revelation from God, when it is a mere impo&s;ture, and yet the cheat never be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>That the per&s;ons concerned in delivering to us the doctrines of the Bible, &s;hould impo&s;e upon us by known de&s;igned juggle and impo&s;ture; and that without any pro&s;pect of advantage to them&s;elves. This is to make them guilty of the greate&s;t wick|edne&s;s, the vile&s;t iniquity upon no motive, but to be undone in this world, as they found would be their ca&s;e, and undone in the next, &s;uppo&s;ing they believed any thing of another world.</P>
<P>Farther, that &s;o many impo&s;tors and cheats &s;hould unite in the &s;ame black and horried de&s;igns; invent lies and impo&s;e them upon the world in the name of God; and that none of them &s;hould ever re|cant, and di&s;cover the fraud, that neither the love of life, nor the terrors of a violent death, which was the lot of many of them, even on the account of their religion, &s;hould have any influence upon them to make them confe&s;s the truth; but that they &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in their te&s;timony concerning their doctrine, and their mi&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>And that &s;uch wicked men as the per&s;ons I am now &s;peaking of, the unbelievers, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them to be, &s;hould with &s;uch an evil con&s;cience &s;et them&s;elves to do the greate&s;t good; I mean, deli|ver the mo&s;t excellent doctrine to the world, that has the highe&s;t tendency to promote the honour of God, and the happine&s;s of mankind. Certainly had they been knaves, they would have dealt in other matters, and have appeared in a different form; have flattered mankind, and have endea|voured to recommend them&s;elves to their favour. In &s;hort, according to the fancy of our unbelie|vers, here are a company of the wor&s;t of men in the world, doing the greate&s;t good in the world; and that with a certain pro&s;pect of bringing upon
<PB N="256" REF="028262_0257_0FD7F69114E503A8">them&s;elves the greate&s;t pre&s;ent evils and &s;ufferings. Can any believe this without infatuation?</P>
<P>Again, That the&s;e deceivers and cheats &s;hould be able without any human advantages of learning, &s;ubtilty or &s;ecular power to per&s;uade &s;o great a part of mankind to believe their fables; and upon terms of &s;elf-denial and &s;ufferings, embrace the doc|trines and &s;tories they had invented on their own heads.</P>
<P>That all the experience that thou&s;ands and mil|lions of &s;ober, grave, and wi&s;e men have had of the truth and divinity of the Scripture; of its power to convince, reform, and change mankind; to comfort in their greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to direct and guide in doubts and difficulties, &amp;c. &s;hould all be mere delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>That there &s;hould be a &s;overeign, wi&s;e, and good God, the con&s;tant governor of this world, and in|&s;pector of human affairs; and that he &s;hould &s;tand by and &s;ee &s;o great, &s;o plau&s;ible an impo&s;ture pre|vail among mankind, and never interpo&s;e for its defeat; but in&s;tead thereof, by &s;trange, &s;urpri&s;ing providences, give open countenance to it.</P>
<P>I add, That the Bible &s;hould be fal&s;e, and yet the di&s;covery of this remain the &s;pecial, peculiar attainment and priviledge of per&s;ons of our unbe|lievers character. This, I think unaccountable, and know not why I may not number it among the ab&s;urdities that affect their &s;cheme. I would not aggravate matters here. But I think it evident, they do not reject the Bible becau&s;e they approve of an higher and more excellent &s;cheme of religi|on; becau&s;e they have &s;omething better to advance in the room of the Bible. It is generally &s;u&s;pected concerning them, they had be&s;t &s;ee upon what principles they go that they quarrel with the Bible, becau&s;e it quarrels with them, would di&s;turb their plea&s;ures, and abridge them of their liberties.
<PB N="257" REF="028262_0258_0FD7F69D9C1EF598">And that the&s;e &s;hould be the only men favoured with the judgment and ta&s;te to di&s;tingui&s;h things, or that have the greate&s;t &s;hare of hone&s;ty to profe&s;s and own the truth, is &s;ome what &s;trange, and the belief of it, I perfume, not a little ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Well, the&s;e are &s;ome of the difficulties that clogg the unbeliever's &s;cheme. Whether they do not amount to ab&s;urdides, I leave it to be con&s;idered. If they do, it will be allowed, they &s;erve the pur|po&s;e I mention them for, confirm the authority of the Bible, and a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;trengthen the conclu&s;ion I have been drawing from &s;undry topics and heads of argument, namely, that <HI>the Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have not only &s;hewn that the Scripture is true; but that it is in&s;pired, and of divine origi|nal; which are two of the points I undertook to prove. It remains,</P>
<P N="3">III. That I vindicate the cannon of Scripture, or prove, that the pre&s;ent books of our Bible are the originally in&s;pired books of Scripture. And for the clearer proceeding in this matter, I &s;hall,

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall premi&s;e a few things for &s;tating the point about the canon of Scripture, and to give you &s;ome clear notions of the matter. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. When I &s;ay the books of our pre&s;ent Bible are the original in&s;pired books of Scripture, I do not mean they are the autographs, or the very books in the hand writing of the in&s;pired authors. It may indeed be que&s;tioned, whether there were any great number of them together in this &s;en&s;e? whe|ther Mo&s;es at fir&s;t wrote the five books, that were
<PB N="258" REF="028262_0259_0FD7F69FD84CA460">delivered to the Jews, with his own hand? or, whe|ther the prophets and apo&s;tles wrote, with their own hands, all the &s;acred volumes, the church re|ceived from them, and in their name. They might employ amanuen&s;es, &s;ome to write from their mouths. This &s;eems particularly to have been the ca&s;e of the apo&s;tle Paul, and it might be &s;o of others; as appears from 2 The&s;&s;. iii. 17. <HI>The &s;alu|tation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epi&s;tle, &s;o I write:</HI> intimating, that he u&s;ed to employ others to write the epi&s;tles them|&s;elves, ordinarily, at lea&s;t, that he &s;ent to the churches: he dictated, and they wrote: and then he added with his own hand the &s;alutation, which was a token and &s;ign that the epi&s;tle was from him, and that he owned it. And this, I &s;ay, might be the ca&s;e of the other &s;acred penmen. But however that be, whether they wrote them&s;elves, or others from them, we do not now pretend to have the &s;e|veral fir&s;t original volumes, or any of them. The individual ink and parchment, with, and on which they wrote, could not be pre&s;erved to our time without a miracle. As to the original book of Mo&s;es, or the Pentatcuch, we find it was, by the &s;pecial appointment of God, laid up by the &s;ide of the ark, Deut. xxxi. 25, 26. The text adds, <HI>that it may be there for a witne&s;s again&s;t thee.</HI> It was de|po&s;ited there as a public authentic record, that if any &s;hould attempt to corrupt the law, this divine copy might be produced again&s;t them. Some think it remained by the ark till the de&s;truction of Jeru|&s;alem, but after that, it is in vain to enquire further about it. As to the re&s;t of the in&s;pired books, I mean, in their fir&s;t and original manu&s;cripts, we know le&s;s of them; how long they were pre&s;erved, or when they peri&s;hed. What we pretend to is, that they were wrote out for the u&s;e of the church in their re&s;pective ages, and communicated in faith|ful
<PB N="259" REF="028262_0260_0FD7F6A0D9C0DD70">copies from one generation to another. But as to the original or fir&s;t books, they are long &s;ince peri&s;hed and lo&s;t. Nor could it be otherwi&s;e, as I &s;aid, without a miracle. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. I would premi&s;e, that I do not &s;uppo&s;e the copies we have of the fir&s;t original books are &s;o ab|&s;olutely perfect that there is not the lea&s;t error therein. This is what can be &s;aid of no ancient book in the world. Tully complains of the Latin authors, that they were publi&s;hed with many blun|ders and mi&s;takes in his time: and the &s;ame com|plaint has been made of all others, whether Latin or Greek hi&s;torians, poets, and philo&s;ophers. And though more may be &s;aid in behalf of the &s;acred books, than of any of the re&s;t; yet it would be ex|travagant to a&s;&s;ert, they are brought down to us free of all mi&s;takes. It is but about three hundred years &s;ince printing was &s;ound out: and before that time they were tran&s;cribed, I may &s;ay, almo&s;t an infinite number of times. And I think it not po&s;&s;ible in an ordinary way, and without in&s;piration, that there &s;hould be no errors in the &s;everal copies. The ignorance, ha&s;te, carele&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. of tran&s;cri|bers would probably betray them into mi&s;takes. And we find in fact, that there is &s;ome difference, there are &s;ome various readings, even among the mo&s;t ancient and authentic copies. But then I have two things to add, viz. that we have rea&s;on to conclude, that the mi&s;takes would not be many, and that they would not be great. They would not be many. The high importance of the things them|&s;elves would excite more than common care. The church in every age received tho&s;e writings as di|vine, and had a mighty veneration for the contents of them: and, con&s;equently would be watchful over them that they might not be corrupted and de|praved. And as God de&s;igned them for the u&s;e
<PB N="260" REF="028262_0261_0FD7F6A257199AD0">of the church in all ages, one cannot but expect a &s;pecial &s;uperintendency of providence over them. So that we have rea&s;on, I &s;ay, to think the errors would not be many. And I &s;ubjoin, we may ex|pect they would not be great. It is certain, they are not in matters of any great importance. All ancient copies agree in every article and doctrine of religion. And what various readings there are, are only in things of le&s;s weight, in which the chri&s;|tian faith and religion is not much concerned. And even here the &s;kilful critic is able, by com|paring the &s;everal copies, to di&s;cover which is the true and genuine reading. Often it may be done; and where it is otherwi&s;e, and it yet remains uncer|tain which copy is the true reading, which is mo&s;t likely to be the original in&s;pired text, it is in &s;uch minute matters that religion runs no hazards, &s;uffers no damage: all copies agreeing not only in the e&s;&s;entials, but even in the &s;ub&s;tance and all impor|tant circum&s;tances of divine doctrines and hi&s;tories of fact.</P>
<P N="3">3. I do not know that it is nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain, that all that was ever written by in&s;pired men, is pre&s;erved and contained in our Bible. This, I am &s;en&s;ible, is a controver&s;y of &s;ome difficulty. But as I do not think it proper for the auditory, I &s;hall not trouble you with it. Some have thought the Bible mentions &s;everal &s;acred pieces, which we have not, as the <HI>three thou&s;and</HI> parables or proverbs of Solomon, and the <HI>thou&s;and and five &s;ongs;</HI> be|&s;ides his books of natural philo&s;ophy; for we are told, that he <HI>&s;pake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hy&s;&s;op that &s;pringeth out of the wall. He &s;pake al&s;o of bea&s;ts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fi&s;hes.</HI> The&s;e they think might be in&s;pired books, but now are lo&s;t. As al&s;o the books of Nathan the prophet, and of Gad the &s;eer, mentioned 1 Chron. xxix. 29. The
<PB N="261" REF="028262_0262_0FD7F6A67A3F9B18">prophecies of Ahijah the &s;halonite, the vi&s;ions of Iddo the &s;eer, 2 Chron. ix. 29. The book of Ja|&s;her, Jo&s;h. x. 13. To which &s;ome have added &s;e|veral go&s;pels who&s;e names occur in the primitive writers: and the epi&s;tle to the Laodiceans, &s;poken of Col. iv. 16. as they would under&s;tand the text. The&s;e they think were the works of in&s;pired men; but by &s;ome means or other now lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But others are of a different mind, and think none of the&s;e writings were in&s;pired. However, I &s;hall pa&s;s over this debate, and the arguments produced on the one &s;ide, or the other, for the e&s;|tabli&s;hing their different opinions. In the mean while, I do not think it any prejudice to religion to &s;uppo&s;e, though we have no &s;ufficient evidence of the fact, that there might be &s;ome divine writ|ings, &s;ome narrations, or go&s;pels, for in&s;tance, and &s;ome epi&s;tles, drawn up by in&s;pired men that are not included in our canon, or catalogue of &s;acred books. The apo&s;tles had their di&s;tinct provinces, were di&s;per&s;ed through a great part of the world to &s;pread the chri&s;tian religion, they could not &s;tay long in a place, and it is not improbable they might all of them, or mo&s;t of them, leave ab&s;tracts of their doctrine behind them in the places where they had been; and when they took leave of the churches they had gathered, being called el&s;ewhere. Now &s;hould it be granted, there might have been more of the&s;e than are now come to us, this is neither an argument again&s;t the authority of the books we have, nor again&s;t their &s;ufficiency. There were many more things that Je&s;us did, than tho&s;e the evangeli&s;ts have written, as St. John tells us. And no doubt there were many di&s;cour&s;es he delivered, many &s;ermons of his apo&s;tles, which they delivered by in&s;piration, that were not recorded. And &s;ome that were occa&s;ionally written, which an&s;wered the end for which they were publi&s;hed; and yet not
<PB N="262" REF="028262_0263_0FD7F6B2AE5724D8">being intended for general and univer&s;al u&s;e, are not pre&s;erved and continued in the church. This may be granted without any di&s;advantage to the authority, or &s;ufficiency of our Bible. Though, as I &s;aid, we have no certainty of it, and it is more than can be proved. Hereupon,</P>
<P N="4">4. What I intend, when I &s;ay, that the books of our Bible are the original in&s;pired books of Scrip|ture, is in &s;hort this; that the books we now have and embrace as in&s;pired, are tho&s;e that the church of Chri&s;t has all along owned as &s;uch, and received into the canon, or catalogue of &s;acred Scriptures. It has received all the&s;e books as in&s;pired, and re|ceived none el&s;e. And further, that they have come down to us in the main uncorrupt. None of tho&s;e that were once admitted into the canon are lo&s;t; and none of them corrupted in any points of con&s;equence, or importance. Let me add,</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;acred canon, 'or catalogue of in&s;pired books, was not compo&s;ed and fini&s;hed at once; but gradually, and at different times. This may be affirmed with re&s;pect both to the Old Te&s;tament and the New. The books of the Old Te&s;tament were delivered to the church at diver&s;e times; fir&s;t the decalogue, or ten commandments; the two ta|bles wrote by the finger of God, with the other laws revealed on mount Sinai; and afterwards the whole pentateuch, or five books of Mo&s;es. When and where Mo&s;es wrote the&s;e, with other que&s;tions of the like nature I pa&s;s over, and &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that the fir&s;t and original book of the law was laid up in a che&s;t or coffer, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by the &s;ide of the ark, and kept there as the &s;acred &s;tandard of their religion under that di&s;pen&s;ation: copies of it being di&s;per&s;ed among the people. And this was the fir&s;t part of the &s;cripture canon. The other books of the Old Te&s;tament were ad|ded afterwards, as they were occa&s;ionally written;
<PB N="263" REF="028262_0264_0FD7F6B46CA67350">the per&s;ons that tendered them to the church having fir&s;t given &s;atisfaction concerning their in|&s;piration. How this was done, is a que&s;tion of too great nicety, now to be con&s;idered and re&s;ol|ved. Sometimes, it is likely, they came with the power of miracles; &s;ometimes the per&s;ons, that offered any revelation to be received by the church, were e&s;tabli&s;hed and known prophets; or they had the te&s;timony of allowed and approved prophets. They &s;pake in the name of God, and brought &s;uffi|cient credentials with them: God giving te&s;timo|ny to them in a &s;upernatural way that he &s;ent them, and that their me&s;&s;age was divine. Let me only ob&s;erve farther, with reference to the Old Te&s;ta|ment, that it is probable the canon of it was &s;et|tled: all the books of it reduced into one volume, and delivered to the church after the captivity. This is the common opinion of learned men, and they make it the work of the great &s;ynagogue, as it is called, in which were pre&s;ent Ezra, Haggai, Za|chary, Malachi, Nehemiah, and Zerubbabel. The&s;e collected all the in&s;pired books, &s;uch as were written during the captivity, as well as before, and committed them to the care of the church.</P>
<P>The like ob&s;ervations might be made concern|ing the canon of the New Te&s;tament. It was at fir&s;t publi&s;hed to the world, by Chri&s;t and the apo&s;|tles in their &s;ermons, before any part of it was committed to writing. Nor was it written all at once, but gradually &s;ome at one time, and &s;ome at another; in what order, and way. I am not now to enquire. I would only &s;ugge&s;t, that as &s;everal per&s;ons were extraordinarily called to preach the go&s;pel and publi&s;h the doctrines of it to the world; &s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e were &s;tirred up to write for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of the church, at different times, as it plea&s;ed God by his &s;pirit to direct them. It is &s;uppo&s;ed the go&s;pels were written fir&s;t, and that in
<PB N="264" REF="028262_0265_0FD7F6B5E3B2BF88">the order in which they now &s;tand in our Bible: and the epi&s;tles occa&s;ionally, as the affairs of the church required, and the in&s;piring Spirit conducted. At la&s;t, before the age of in&s;piration cea&s;ed, and towards the clo&s;e of it all the writings of the New Te&s;tament were collected into a volume, and left as a &s;acred tru&s;t to the church in future ages. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been done by St. John, who out|lived all the other apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>I have given the&s;e hints in an ha&s;ty, &s;uperficial manner, the illu&s;trating and confirming of which would require more time and di&s;cour&s;e, than I doubt would be agreeable to &s;ome of my hearers, upon a &s;ubject &s;o much out of their way. They may however, afford you an imperfect view of a very important &s;ubject. And &s;o I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove, that the pre&s;ent books of our Bi|ble, are the originally in&s;pired Scriptures, that is, the books are the &s;ame that were at fir&s;t given by in&s;piration of God. We have the &s;ame pentateuch that Mo&s;es delivered to the Jews. We have all the re&s;t of the books both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, that the in&s;pired writers left with the church. We have the &s;ame in number and kind, and they are not corrupted or depraved in matters of moment, much le&s;s, in points fundamental. I will evidence this with re&s;pect to both the Old and New Te&s;tament: yet very briefly, that I may not too long try your patience. Though methinks, if you would con&s;ider the matter, I might expect your attention, our faith and hope, our eternal all, de|pend upon the truth and divinity of the Bible, and to prove the books of it genuine, is the &s;ame thing with regard to your &s;piritual intere&s;ts, as it is with regard to your temporal concerns, to prove your deeds and conveyances are genuine.</P>
<P N="1">1. I will begin with the Old Te&s;tament, and prove that could not be changed, or corrupted;
<PB N="265" REF="028262_0266_0FD7F6B7AD246968">but that we have the &s;ame original books, that Mo|&s;es and the prophets delivered to the Jews.</P>
<P>To which purpo&s;e let it be con&s;idered, that it was morally impo&s;&s;ible, that the books of the Old Te&s;|tament &s;hould be changed or corrupted. The law was publi&s;hed and revealed in a very &s;olemn and awful manner, at mount Sinai. The original book was laid up, as you have heard, in the &s;anctuary, to which they might have recour&s;e upon occa&s;ion. Copies were delivered out for the u&s;e of the people, and di&s;per&s;ed among them, with a &s;pecial charge that they &s;hould not add thereto, nor dimini&s;h from it, Deut. iv. 2. and again, xii. 32. <HI>What things &s;oe|ver I command you ob&s;erve to do it. Thou &s;halt not add thereto, nor dimini&s;h from it.</HI> And as they had the law in their hands, &s;o they were obliged to have it <HI>in their hearts,</HI> to teach it <HI>diligently to</HI> their <HI>chil|dren,</HI> and <HI>talk of it when they &s;at in their hou&s;es,</HI> when they <HI>walked</HI> by the <HI>way,</HI> when they <HI>lay down,</HI> and <HI>when</HI> they <HI>ro&s;e up; to write it upon the doer-po&s;ts of</HI> their <HI>hou&s;es</HI> and <HI>upon their gates,</HI> Deut. vi. 6, 7, 9. And Chap. xi. 18, 19, 20. And &s;o conver&s;ant were they, and &s;o expert in their law, that Jo&s;ephus tells us they had it con&s;tantly in their mouths, and knew every thing in it as well as their own names.</P>
<P>And as the law was matter of every one's &s;tudy, &s;o the public reading of it was a con&s;tant part of their wor&s;hip. We are told, <HI>Mo&s;es had in old time them that preached him, being read in their &s;yna|gogues every Sabbath day.</HI> Add to this, that in the year of the relea&s;e, at the end of every &s;eventh year, the book of the law was produced, and &s;olemnly read before all the people. They read their law every week by di&s;tinct portions in their &s;ynagogues, or places of religious wor&s;hip. And on this occa|&s;ion the whole volume was brought forth, and read before the people. Now the&s;e circum&s;tances, and many more might be taken notice of, make it next
<PB N="266" REF="028262_0267_0FD7F6B9ECA229A8">to impo&s;&s;ible, that the law &s;hould be changed, or corrupted. They had authentic copies of it among them. Some of the Jews tell us, Mo&s;es wrote thirteen copies thereof with his own hand, that he delivered one to the prie&s;ts to be pre&s;erved in the holy place, and one to each of the twelve tribes to be kept by the elders of each tribe. The de&s;ign of which, it is likely, was that the people of each tribe might have an authentic copy to have re|cour&s;e to, if any thing was thought to be ami&s;s in the more private copies; as the whole nation upon the like occa&s;ion might re&s;ort to the copy in the &s;anctuary. This being the ca&s;e, it is, I &s;ay, mo|rally impo&s;&s;ible that a law thus promulgated, in which a whole nation had &s;o great an intere&s;t, their government, polity, civil as well as religious inte|re&s;t depending upon it; a law &s;o con&s;tantly read, &s;o univer&s;ally &s;tudied and known &s;hould be altered. None could attempt to do it without being di&s;co|vered; nor would they e&s;cape the puni&s;hment due by the law to &s;uch a wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, as a farther argument, it is con&s;iderable, that they had the utmo&s;t veneration for their law. They reverenced it even to &s;uper&s;tition, as might be &s;hewn in many in&s;tances. Some have told us, that they thought every private man, that could, was obliged to write a copy of the law with his own hand. And they were &s;trangely &s;uper&s;titious in the manner of their writing, which however let us &s;ee in what high e&s;teem their law was with them, and that they thought they could not pay it reverence enough. But to omit other particulars, I will only take notice that they had an order of men among them, their Ma&s;orites, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to watch over the &s;acred text, and take care that not the lea&s;t change &s;hould be made in it. And the pains they took to this purpo&s;e were very extraor|dinary. They numbered not only all the ver&s;es,
<PB N="267" REF="028262_0268_0FD7F6BC96ADE0B0">but words and letters of the law; took an account how often any word occurred therein; critici&s;ed upon the form of every letter, how differently it was written; and employed an indu&s;try and art that was almo&s;t incredible. Now was it likely, was it even po&s;&s;ible, that a book thus guarded &s;hould be corrupted?</P>
<P>I might farther urge to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that our Saviour, who &s;o freely upon many occa&s;ions cen&s;ures the Jews, particularly the Scribes and Phari&s;ees for their faults, never once accu&s;es them of corrupting their Scriptures, or of any de&s;igns of that kind. He tells them of their hypocri&s;y, their oppre&s;&s;ion and pride; of their making void the law by their traditions; but never charges them with changing it, or corrupting any of the books of it. But rather bears te&s;timony to them in this particular, whil&s;t he directs to the &s;earching the Scripture, that is, the writings of the Old Te&s;ta|ment; for the&s;e were all the Scriptures extant at that time, and &s;aith, that therein they had eternal life; which he would not have &s;aid, had they ei|ther changed or corrupted it. And we find the apo&s;tle mentions the Jews, as having the &s;acred tru&s;t of the Scripture le&s;t in their hands, without hinting one word of their unfaithfulne&s;s, <HI>unto them were committed the oracles of God.</HI> Now as this crime, the corrupting the &s;acred oracles, would have been the greate&s;t of all crimes, we cannot imagine our Saviour and his apo&s;tles would have pa&s;&s;ed it over in &s;ilence, had they been guilty of it.</P>
<P>Farther, the New Te&s;tament frequently inti|mates, that the text of the Old Te&s;tament was not corrupted. This is implied in that our Lord and his apo&s;tles &s;o often confirm their doctrine thereby, and appeal to the authority of Mo&s;es and the pro|phets. The apo&s;tle in the text declares, <HI>all Scrip|ture,</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="028262_0269_0FD7F6C7B01207C0">meaning the Scripture of the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>was given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> And &s;peaking of Timothy's knowing the Scripture from his child|hood, he &s;ays, they were <HI>able to make wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation, through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> An argument that they were entire and not depraved. I might &s;ubjoin the te&s;timony of their own writers, as Jo&s;ephus, for in&s;tance, who, notwith&s;tanding he upbraids them for their many crying iniquities, and imputes the dreadful judgments that came upon them to their &s;ins and apo&s;ta&s;ies, yet clears them of any guilt in corrupting their law; and indeed, ap|plauds their zeal in and about it. And, which is very much to our purpo&s;e, he gives us a catalogue of the divine books they had pre&s;erved; the very &s;ame that now we have. Philo, another of their learned writers, bears te&s;timony concerning them; that from the going forth of the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt, from the giving of the law, until his days, which was about two thou&s;and years, there was not &s;o much as a word changed or altered therein: and adds, that there was not any Jew but would rather die an hundred times over, than &s;uffer his law to be changed in the lea&s;t. And this I think &s;ufficient to prove that the Old Te&s;tament is not changed; but that the &s;ame original in&s;pired books are communicated to the chri&s;tian church, that the church of the Jews received from Mo&s;es and the prophets. I mu&s;t ha&s;ten through the other cla&s;s of argument, viz.</P>
<P N="2">2. To prove, that the books of the New-Te&s;ta|ment remain the &s;ame and uncorrupted. I &s;hall only mention the heads that might be in&s;i&s;ted upon more fully.</P>
<P>It is a good argument that the books left by the evangeli&s;ts and apo&s;tles were the very &s;ame we now have, in that we find in the mo&s;t early writers of the chri&s;tian church quotations out of them, in which
<PB N="269" REF="028262_0270_0FD7F6CCBA460B88">the very &s;ame words are produced we now find in them. We have &s;everal of the&s;e quotations in the very fir&s;t writers; which &s;hews that the books, the chri&s;tian church then made u&s;e of, and received as the writings of the in&s;pired apo&s;tles, were the &s;ame and not different books, from tho&s;e we have in our hands and receive as &s;uch. We have te&s;timonies to this purpo&s;e above one thou&s;and five hundred years old.</P>
<P>And then it is ob&s;ervable, that we have in the writers of the primitive church, even in the very fir&s;t ages, li&s;ts of the sacred books of the New-Te&s;|tament. They not only quote them, but number them; mention the four evangeli&s;ts, Paul's epi&s;tles, and the re&s;t as the works of &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, who&s;e names they bear. I cannot here produce the evidence of this; but dare be accountable for it at any time.</P>
<P>Again, Tertullian, one of the fir&s;t of the fathers, who lived within a little more than an hundred years after the apo&s;tle John, takes notice of the original writings under the hands of the apo&s;tles; as what remained in &s;ome churches in his day. Now if this was &s;o, the church at that time had a full op|portunity of &s;atisfying them&s;elves concerning any book, or pa&s;&s;age, by appealing to tho&s;e churches as to &s;uch particular books, or pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>Further, we have the canon of the New Te&s;ta|ment owned and declared by an early council in the primitive church, which hath left it as it now is. They place the &s;ame books, and no more in it than what are now received in the prote&s;tant churches.</P>
<P>Some of the keene&s;t enemies of the chri&s;tian faith owned many of the books of the New Te&s;ta|ment, that is, that they were written by &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons in who&s;e names they appear. Thus Julian the apo&s;tate mentions the go&s;pels of Mat|thew and Mark, of Luke and John. And others
<PB N="270" REF="028262_0271_0FD7F6CF64CE5530">mention other books; an argument that nothing could be objected again&s;t the fact, that the&s;e books were wrote by &s;uch per&s;ons. They herein grant, that the chri&s;tians did not forge their books, but re|ceived them from &s;uch authors.</P>
<P>I might add, that &s;ome of the fathers argue again&s;t the here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es they oppo&s;e, that their doctrines did not agree with the unque&s;tionable writings of the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>In a word, it is not probable, nor indeed po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e books &s;hould be forged, be changed or corrupted in any material points. For,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. they could not be corrupted during the lives of the apo&s;tles, while the church was under the conduct of an infallible &s;pirit, and under the authority of the prime mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t's kingdom. Should any then have attempted to impo&s;e &s;purious writ|ings upon the church, there was an ea&s;y remedy at hand. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e any books would then be admitted, but what were approved by the apo&s;|tles and apo&s;tolic men. And con&s;equently, for the fir&s;t age the canon of Scripture mu&s;t, I think, be allowed to be &s;ecure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. When the divine books were communicated to the church, they were re|ceived with great reverence and veneration, and e&s;teemed as their glory and trea&s;ure. They look|ed upon them as a revelation from heaven, and charter for heaven; the rule of their life, and foun|dation of their hope. And we find that generally they would &s;ubmit to any tortures and deaths rather than renounce or part with them. And can we imagine they would corrupt them them&s;elves, or willingly &s;uffer others to do it? No more than you would allow knavi&s;h men to tamper with the wri|tings by which you hold your e&s;tates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There were great numbers of copies &s;pread abroad through the &s;everal churches of Chri&s;t, and in &s;everal nations. Now it cannot be thought all &s;hould agree in a de|&s;ign
<PB N="271" REF="028262_0272_0FD7F6D0E9E9BC80">of changing or corrupting the original books. And if &s;ome only &s;hould endeavor it, the uncor|rupted copies would remain to detect them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They were very early and &s;oon tran&s;lated into dif|ferent languages, and a multitude of learned men made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to teach, explain, and write comments upon them. Now &s;uppo&s;ing there was &s;omething wrong in one ver&s;ion, or in this or that copy, &s;omething changed, added, or taken away; there were many other copies, and other ver&s;ions by help of which the neglect or fraud might be and would be corrected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They were con&s;tantly read in their public a&s;&s;emblies. As the primitive chri&s;|tians u&s;ed to be very conver&s;ant with them in pri|vate, &s;o the reading of them was always a part of their &s;olemn and joint wor&s;hip. By which means, they could not but be well acquainted with them, and have them fixed in their minds and memories, which would be a &s;ecurity again&s;t any remarkable corruption of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Chri&s;tians were &s;oon un|happily divided into different parties and opinions, had many di&s;putes among them&s;elves about &s;ome articles of their faith; in all which they appealed to the holy Scripture as the &s;tandard of their faith, and the judge of their que&s;tions: and con&s;equently no one party could corrupt the &s;ame, but the re&s;t would complain of them, and expo&s;e them for it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Add to all this, the watchfulne&s;s of divine pro|vidence, which we have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied would intere&s;t it&s;elf in this matter, and not &s;uffer the word of God to be altered or corrupted in things of mo|ment, that concern the &s;alvation of mankind, or that would affect and de&s;troy the de&s;ign of his af|fording &s;uch a revelation to the world. In &s;hort, it is as rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a crafty lawyer could forge a new &s;tatute book, and a new body of laws for the people of England, and bring them into our courts, as that any men, whatever their de&s;igns
<PB N="272" REF="028262_0273_0FD7F6D4C99093F0">were, could change or corrupt the books of the New Te&s;tament, which were received by all &s;orts of chri&s;tians, as the rule of their religion, and char|ter of their happine&s;s.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And thus, I hope, I have cleared in &s;ome mea|&s;ure the que&s;tion relating to the canon of Scripture; have &s;hewn you that the books of our pre&s;ent Bi|ble are the original in&s;pired books thereof. I pro|mi&s;ed to take notice of &s;ome objections: but mu&s;t leave them to another di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean while, what has been &s;aid, is matter of no &s;mall &s;atisfaction and comfort to the judicious and inqui&s;itive chri&s;tian. The Bible is his inheri|tance; its te&s;timonies the rejoicing of his heart; and it cannot but give him a plea&s;ure, the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, to &s;ee this well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and its autho|rity vindicated. And &s;hould we not value, &s;tudy, and endeavor to improve our Bible, and the &s;everal books of it; when we have &s;o good a&s;&s;urance that they are divine. The high importance of the things contained therein &s;hould recommend it. The ble&s;&s;ed tendency of its doctrines, &s;hould re|commend it. And methinks it &s;hould exceedingly rai&s;e our e&s;teem of it, that it is a book &s;ent from God. O learn to receive it, and reverence it as &s;uch; and to an&s;wer the apo&s;tles character of the The&s;&s;alonians, in which he &s;o much rejoices, and with which I &s;hall conclude, <HI>For this cau&s;e thank we God without cea&s;ing, becau&s;e when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE endeavored to clear and vindicate the canon of Scripture, have proved that the books of our Bible, are the Scriptures that were given by in&s;piration of God. I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;everal ob|jections have been made to the account I have gi|ven. But as I am in ha&s;te to come to a conclu&s;ion, and cannot &s;uppo&s;e many of my hearers &s;o well acquainted with the&s;e matters, as to de&s;ire a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and examination of them, or likely to receive it with advantage; I &s;hall in a great mea|&s;ure pa&s;s them by, and only mention a few of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is objected, that we know not when or by whom the canon of the Old or New Te&s;tament was &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. I an&s;wer, we have very probable evidence that the canon of the Old Te&s;|tament was &s;upervi&s;ed and &s;ettled by Ezra after the return of the Jews from captivity: and that of the New Te&s;tament by the apo&s;tle John, as I ob&s;erved before. However, it is &s;ufficient if we can prove both were &s;ettled whil&s;t the church was under the conduct of in&s;pired men; who, we may be &s;ure,
<PB N="274" REF="028262_0275_0FD7F6E25ABE11C0">would admit no books into the canon, but &s;uch as were authentic and divine. Let us lay the &s;cene among our&s;elves, and in our own nation: &s;uppo&s;e we had had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prophets, and &s;everal books of religion had been written among us, &s;ome in one age, &s;ome in another; and offered to the church as in&s;pired, at lea&s;t, before all the prophets, or other in&s;pired per&s;ons, were gone from among us, and that extraordinary order cea&s;ed, all the di|vine books were gathered into a volume, and de|livered to the church, as the rule of religion. Sup|po&s;ing this the ca&s;e: I cannot &s;ee we could rea&s;on|ably doubt of our canon, though we knew not cer|tainly when it was received in the church whil&s;t it had in&s;pired guides. And this is really the ca&s;e with reference to the canon of Scripture. There were &s;everal prophets in the Jewi&s;h church, as Hag|gai, Zachary and Malachi, after the canon was fi|ni&s;hed, as we now have it. And we may conclude, that the&s;e men would neither &s;uffer in&s;pired books to be rejected, nor &s;purious ones to be obtruded on the church.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is objected, that there are &s;ome books both of the Old and New Te&s;tament that we know not the writers of; and had they been in&s;pired, &s;urely we &s;hould have them under the names of the in|&s;pired authors. To omit other in&s;tances, it is un|certain, &s;ay our objectors, by whom the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews was written, neither by the apo&s;tle Paul, by Luke, his con&s;tant companion, or by Cle|mens his fellow laborer, as he is called; or by Bar|nabas. Some of the ancients a&s;cribe it to one of the&s;e, and &s;ome to another. I an&s;wer, that though the writer of this or that book might for rea&s;ons, which then had their weight, be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for a time; yet at la&s;t it was generally known. Thus, for example, almo&s;t all antiquity agreed that the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews was wrote by the apo&s;tle
<PB N="275" REF="028262_0276_0FD7F6E3B1A2E8C0">Paul. But I an&s;wer further, the character of the book it&s;elf is of far greater moment, than the name of the writer. If it brought evidence that it was a divine book, the que&s;tion, who wrote it? is not very material. And if it was received as an in|&s;pired book in the age when it was wrote, and whil&s;t the church was governed by in&s;pired men, as I &s;aid before, this would be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the church in any after age concerning it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is pretended, there were many other books be&s;ides the&s;e we retain in our canon, that went abroad in the primitive church under the name of in&s;pired authors; and how come tho&s;e in our can|on only to be admitted, and the re&s;t rejected; when they claimed equal authority? I an&s;wer to this, I grant there was in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity a great number of apocryphal writings. It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when &s;o admirable an in&s;ti|tution as that of the chri&s;tian religion fir&s;t took place in the world, its profe&s;&s;ors would be com|menting upon it in a great variety of books, which they did under different titles, as acts, epi&s;tles, go&s;|pels, intineraries, recognitions, martyrdoms, and the like. And as the&s;e would be read by all &s;orts, &s;o it is not improbable, but &s;ome of them might for a time pa&s;s for divine and in&s;pired. But I add, when the church came to examine and try them, they were rejected, as being different from the ge|nius, &s;pirit, and manner of the apo&s;tles, as Eu&s;ebius gives the rea&s;on; they were not &s;ufficiently recom|mended, were not approved by any apo&s;tle or apo&s;|tolic men; were found de&s;titute of internal cha|racters, in &s;ome things contrary to the unque&s;tion|able writings of the apo&s;tles, &amp;c. And therefore whatever e&s;teem they might once have, they were upon good rea&s;on afterwards &s;et a&s;ide, and of no authority, and became neglected.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="276" REF="028262_0277_0FD7F6E527678A28">
4. It is farther objected, that &s;ome of the books in our canon, were not owned and received in the fir&s;t age of the church. I an&s;wer, this may be grant|ed without any prejudice to the authority of the&s;e books. The canon was not compleated at once, as I have already ob&s;erved, but was a gradual thing. The books of the New Te&s;tament were written &s;ome at one time, &s;ome at another, upon different occa&s;ions. The apo&s;tles, you know, were &s;ent forth to di&s;ciple all nations, to <HI>preach the go&s;pel to every creature,</HI> and in their journies up and down, they wrote many of their epi&s;tles. And as the church was under per&s;ecution, and one part lay at a great di&s;tance from another, we need not wonder that &s;ome churches had in&s;pired writings, which others at fir&s;t knew nothing of; and hence might proceed the &s;cruples that tho&s;e had with reference to particular books. They were but lately come to their hands; they had not &s;ufficient opportunity of examining them, and of receiving the te&s;timony of their brethren concerning them. But then I add, after due examination, the books referred to in the objection, were univer&s;ally received. So that in reality, this is &s;o far from being an objection again&s;t the canon, that it is an argument in favor of it. The church fir&s;t que&s;tioned &s;ome books, and doubted of them; which &s;hews they were not cre|dulous. But afterwards they admitted them as divine; which &s;hews they had &s;atisfaction concern|ing them. In a word, the fir&s;t chri&s;tians engaged in the profe&s;&s;ion of their religion, not with the loo&s;ene&s;s, indifference, and treachery of our times; but with an extraordinary warmth, zeal, and &s;elf|denial. Religion was the greate&s;t thing in the world with them. They would not betray the chri&s;tian church, part with any doctrine, or any rule of practice in the New Te&s;tament, much le&s;s any book of it, for all the world. The &s;acred vo|lumes
<PB N="277" REF="028262_0278_0FD7F6E695AB7858">were dearer to them than their lives. No inducement, promi&s;es or threatnings, rewards or terrors, could prevail with them to give them up, or &s;uffer them to be depraved. I might &s;ubjoin, that all the books of the New Te&s;tament &s;eem very much of a piece; all written with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and worthy of the &s;ame divine author. Not one of them has any internal character that di&s;graces it, or brings it under &s;u&s;picion. So that as the books we at pre&s;ent have, are the &s;ame the fir&s;t chri&s;tians owned, after great caution, &s;erious and &s;trict ex|amination, when there was any room for que&s;tion, owned as divine, and gloried in as a trea&s;ure from heaven, we have abundant rea&s;on to own them as &s;uch too. Our Scripture is the &s;ame with theirs, both given by in&s;piration of God, both have that go&s;pel, which, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have fini&s;hed the third thing propo&s;|ed under the head of vindicating the canon of Scripture. What remains in the cour&s;e of the ge|neral method, is to an&s;wer objections again&s;t the in&s;piration thereof. A great deal has been offered to prove that the Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God. Many volumes formerly, and of late, have been filled with the argument. But notwith&s;tand|ing all that has been &s;aid, or can be &s;aid, there are &s;ome that it &s;eems are not, will not be &s;atisfied. And I &s;hall now con&s;ider what the&s;e per&s;ons have to alledge as the rea&s;on of their infidelity; if one may &s;uppo&s;e they have any thing for it that de&s;erves the name of rea&s;on. Was I here to defend the cau&s;e of religion at large, I &s;hould divide the objectors into different cla&s;&s;es; for they &s;eem to be of differ|ent thoughts, and act upon different principles in their oppo&s;ition to the Bible. Some in&s;inuate, that &s;upernatural revelation is needle&s;s, and that natu|ral religion, as they call it, is not only &s;ufficient, but
<PB N="278" REF="028262_0279_0FD7F6EB55A30C18">really preferable to that of the Scripture, which they repre&s;ent as dull, ab&s;urd, involved in difficul|ties, and unintelligible.</P>
<P>Others &s;peak a little more mode&s;tly. They al|low the Bible has its excellencies: but then they think it wants evidence of its divinity. They would be willing, they pretend, to &s;ee it well prov|ed; but there are difficulties in their way that they cannot get over.</P>
<P>And &s;ome of tho&s;e that would be thought more in earne&s;t, have collected from ancient and modern writers all the exceptions and cavils they can meet with again&s;t particular pa&s;&s;ages of the Bible. The&s;e they &s;et off with &s;uch ornaments of language and oratory, as they are ma&s;ters of, and &s;end them abroad into the world as rea&s;ons again&s;t the Scrip|ture.</P>
<P>Others attack our arguments by which we &s;up|port the authority of the Bible, and endeavor to rai&s;e difficulties, and &s;hew the weakne&s;s of them; &s;uch as are taken from miracles, prophecy, the &s;preading of the chri&s;tian religion, and the like.</P>
<P>But the main body of the anti&s;cripturi&s;ts act a different, and even a meaner part. All their &s;trength lies in a few quirks of wit, that they have picked up in common conver&s;ation, or in the clubs of their companions. They neither read, &s;tudy, nor under&s;tand any part of the Bible, nor do they concern them&s;elves with the rea&s;ons that are offered in its behalf. They have received prejudices a|gain&s;t it, and the&s;e they run away with without ever examining matters. They get hold of a few topics of raillery, &s;ingle out a few texts and phra&s;es, which they have learned in their manner to repre&s;ent as ridiculous; and from the abu&s;e of the&s;e, they con|demn the whole, and even think they have gained a victory.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, you do not expect that I &s;hould
<PB N="279" REF="028262_0280_0FD7F6F1F6246D88">examine all their pleas, and lay open the cavils that each cla&s;s of them bring again&s;t the authority of the Scripture. This would take up more time than I de&s;ign to employ in the remaining part of the &s;ubject. And, as I would hope, I am not at pre|&s;ent &s;peaking to any of this unhappay character, it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t largely on the&s;e things. I &s;hall however for the confirming your faith, take notice of, and endeavor to remove, &s;ome of the more plau&s;ible objections. I &s;hall run through them briefly, and &s;o pa&s;s on to what may be thought more u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some of the&s;e per&s;ons take offence at the &s;tyle of the Scripture: they pretend it is low, flat, and dull; has none of that vivacity and &s;pirit that might be expected in an in&s;pired book. I an&s;wer, this objection is not true with re&s;pect to the whole Bible. There is as true rhetoric, as &s;trong figures, as much pomp and grandeur of &s;tyle, in &s;ome parts of the holy Scripture, as in any book in the world. Job is thought to be not only the fir&s;t, but the fine&s;t &s;pecimen of poetry that has yet been produced by any, either ancients or moderns. Several of the prophets deliver them&s;elves in the &s;ublime&s;t &s;trains of oratory. And it has been ob&s;erved of the apo&s;|tle Paul, that there is often not only a great purity in his language, but much art in his &s;tyle; and that in his defence before Felix and Agrippa, he out|&s;oars the highe&s;t flights of Cicero and Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P>But I grant, the main of the Bible doth not run in this &s;train of an orator. But then this is &s;o far from being an objection again&s;t it, that it is rather an argument of its divinity. It &s;peaks from God, teaches, commands, enacts, promi&s;es, and threatens in the name of the great Sovereign of the world. The importance of its matter, and the authority of its author, are its oratory. And indeed, the&s;e con|&s;idered, human oratory would be an abatement to
<PB N="280" REF="028262_0281_0FD7F6F4A7746B08">it. When a prince &s;peaks from the throne, he doth not a&s;&s;ume the &s;tyle of a common declaimer, nor u&s;e arts of per&s;ua&s;ion; his authority &s;uper&s;edes all the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e things. And &s;o it is in the ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>Others farther object, the difficulty and ob&s;cu|rity of Scripture. They think had it been a reve|lation from heaven, it would have been plain to all, and upon a level with every man's under&s;tanding; as every one is &s;o much concerned in it. To this I an&s;wer, that what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, is ea&s;y and obvious. None can mi&s;under&s;tand the Scrip|ture in the great e&s;&s;ential points of religion, with|out wilful and wicked neglect. In the mean time, I acknowledge there are difficulties, con&s;iderable difficulties in the Bible; and as it de&s;erves, &s;o it requires a good degree of pains and diligence rightly to under&s;tand it. So it has plea&s;ed God to order and &s;tate his revelation. Some things are exceeding plain and ea&s;y; &s;ome things profound, intricate and difficult; which demand the clo&s;e&s;t attention, and are fit to employ the &s;trength of the greate&s;t genius's and &s;tronge&s;t capacities: a di&s;pen|&s;ation that, I doubt not, has a great deal of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God in it. But this is a matter that needs farther explaining; and it would be for many rea&s;ons proper more fully to con&s;ider it. But I have not room here to make the nece&s;|&s;ary enlargement.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is an objection again&s;t the Bible, that &s;ome who are fond of &s;o unhappy, and one would think uncomfortable a cau&s;e, as that of infidelity, &s;eem to triumph in that it contains doctrines, and relates facts, that are not only ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable, but downright impo&s;&s;ible. And con&s;equently, cannot be in&s;pired, or a revelation from God. Many in|&s;tances are given us under this head; as, the uni|ver&s;al deluge, the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a number
<PB N="281" REF="028262_0282_0FD7F6F5B609A228">of creatures, with proper food, in &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el as the ark; that an a&s;s &s;hould &s;peak; that the &s;un &s;hould &s;tand &s;till, and yet the frame of nature not thrown into confu&s;ion; that Jonah &s;hould live in a whale's belly &s;o long without re&s;piration, and not be dige&s;ted in the &s;tomach of the fi&s;h, &amp;c. And what difficulties they find in &s;ome doctrines of re|ligion, is well known; as, the trinity, the incar|nation, a virgin bringing forth a &s;on, God and man united in one per&s;on, the re&s;urrection of the dead, and the like. The&s;e, &s;ay they, are not only above our comprehen&s;ion, but impo&s;&s;ible; from whence they conclude, they are &s;ufficient to &s;ink and ruin the credit of any book that delivers them as true. To which I reply,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That many things appear in|credible, and impo&s;&s;ible for a time, that afterwards are well enough under&s;tood; appear impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ome, yet are certain and ea&s;y to others. A mul|titude of in&s;tances may be produced to illu&s;trate this from the di&s;coveries that have been made in natural philo&s;ophy. It was once thought impo&s;&s;i|ble there &s;hould be antipodes; and yet now no body que&s;tions it. The king of Siam, it is &s;aid, thought him&s;elf affronted by the Dutch amba&s;&s;a|dor, when he told him that in Holland the water would become &s;o hard in cold weather, that men or elephants might walk upon it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. We believe a great many things we do not under&s;tand, cannot account for, and have rea&s;on to think as impo&s;&s;ible as any of the things the objection refers to in Scrip|ture. What notion have we of the infinite divi&s;i|bility of matter, the union of &s;oul and body, a vital union between &s;pirit and matter. This every one believes, and yet no wi&s;e man will undertake to explain. Nothing is more univer&s;ally agreed upon, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, than the eternity of God; and yet the very notion is amazing, &s;hocks the faculties, and almo&s;t overwhelms the mind; that
<PB N="282" REF="028262_0283_0FD7DADBF55916D8">any thing &s;hould exi&s;t without a cau&s;e of its exi&s;t|ence, as God doth, is utterly inconceivable, and were we not con&s;trained to &s;ay, it mu&s;t be &s;o; we &s;hould be ready to &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible. And the like difficulty might be ob&s;erved of the divine om|nipre&s;ence, or infinite exten&s;ion. The thing it&s;elf is demon&s;trable, and yet the mode inexplicable. In &s;hort, we live in a world of my&s;teries: A mul|titude of things we &s;ee and believe are &s;o; that they are, is plain and certain; yet how they are, we know not; and &s;hould be apt boldly to pro|nounce they could not be, but that we are &s;ure they are. How unrea&s;onable is it then to object again&s;t the Bible, becau&s;e it delivers to us &s;ome things we do not under&s;tand; e&s;pecially if they refer to the incomprehen&s;ible, un&s;earchable nature of God, or the extraordinary acts of infinite power. But</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I would a&s;k the objector, whether he believes God made the world? If &s;o; all his cavils upon this head mu&s;t be ab&s;urd. For nothing can &s;eem more impo&s;&s;ible, and can be more hard to be believed, than the doctrine of the creation; that &s;omething &s;hould be made out of nothing. The famous phi|lo&s;opher Ari&s;totle laid it down as a maxim, again&s;t which there was no conte&s;ting, that nothing can be produced from nothing. Nor indeed can it be de|nied, without having recour&s;e to infinite power. Now &s;ince it is granted by many, at lea&s;t, that re|ject revelation, that God made all things out of nothing; or more properly, when there was nothing, did, by his &s;overeign word and command, bring all things into being. Since this is not thought im|po&s;&s;ible; nothing el&s;e certainly ought to be &s;o; nothing, I am &s;ure, related in the Bible. I pro|ceed to another objection.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3. Some alledge contradictions in Scripture, and thence infer it cannot be in&s;pired. I an&s;wer, the contradictions objected are only &s;eeming, but not
<PB N="283" REF="028262_0284_0FD7F6F95A719F70">real. Nor do I know one particular that is not capable of a rational &s;olution. A little &s;kill in critici&s;m, in the Hebrew and Greek languages, their idioms and properties, and the antiquities and cu&s;toms of tho&s;e countries, where the &s;cenes men|tioned in Scripture lay, and the affairs were acted, will clear the main difficulties. A di&s;tinction of the different &s;en&s;es of words, of the different &s;ub|jects and times, will often do it. Thus when it is &s;aid, <HI>it is appointed for all men once to die.</HI> And el&s;ewhere, <HI>if a man keep Chri&s;t's &s;aying, he &s;hall ne|ver &s;ee death.</HI> There is no contradiction. The one place &s;peaking of natural, the other of &s;pirit|ual or eternal death. So when Mo&s;es &s;ays, <HI>God re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day from all his work.</HI> And Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>my Father worketh hitherto.</HI> There is no oppo&s;ition or contradiction: Mo&s;es &s;peaking of the works of creation, and Chri&s;t of the works of providence. Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>John the bapti&s;t was Eli|as that was to come.</HI> And yet John the bapti&s;t when he was a&s;ked, whether he was Elias? an&s;wer|ed, <HI>I am not.</HI> He was not Elias in per&s;on, but was Elias in office and &s;pirit, as I may &s;ay, and con&s;equently, here is no contradiction. Samuel tells us, God <HI>will not repent.</HI> And yet el&s;ewhere we read, that he did repent, that <HI>he made man on the earth. That he made Saul king.</HI> But here is no contradiction: repentence &s;ignifies in the one place a change of mind and council, from want of fore&s;ight of what would come to pa&s;s. And thus God cannot repent. But then he changes his cour&s;e, as men do when they change their minds; and &s;o he may be &s;aid to repent. And in the like method mo&s;t of the re&s;t of the&s;e appearing contra|dictions may be reconciled, viz. by di&s;tingui&s;hing ambiguous words, di&s;tingui&s;hing different times and re&s;pects, &amp;c. Let me add, that con&s;idering
<PB N="284" REF="028262_0285_0FD7F6FB98661030">the nature and quality of the Bible, that part of it is the mo&s;t ancient book in the world; that it is written in a language but very imperfectly under|&s;tood; that it contains a great variety of matters; treats of &s;ubjects of exceeding difficulty as well as importance, it is not to be wondered at, if &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages occur not ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and that may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight incon&s;i&s;tent. In the mean time it mu&s;t argue a ba&s;e humour of cavil|ling, and a &s;trong prejudice again&s;t the cau&s;e of the Bible to reject it on this account; when it comes re|commended to us with &s;uch a torrent of Evidence.</P>
<P N="4">4. It may be objected, that if the Bible be di|vinely in&s;pired, and the &s;ubjects of it of that impor|tance to mankind as is pretended; matters would not &s;ure have been left under &s;o much uncertainty, and &s;o much in the dark: but a revelation inten|ded for the good of all would have been accom|panied with an evidence convincing to all. I an|&s;wer, the evidence is &s;ufficient. Had it been over|powering, there had been no virtue, no excellency in believing. God de&s;igned to try the tempers of men; that as is &s;aid in another ca&s;e, <HI>they that were approved might be made manife&s;t.</HI> But I an&s;wer further, this objection rudely arraigns the &s;ove|reignty of God, and pre&s;cribes to infinite wi&s;dom. It is like the clay ri&s;ing up again&s;t the potter, &s;ay|ing why ha&s;t thou formed me thus? indeed &s;uch cavils would be endle&s;s, &s;hould we indulge the vile temper. We might as decently a&s;k, why did God make mankind liable to &s;in? why did he &s;uffer him to &s;in? why did he not make every man an angel, and every angel a &s;eraph? but as &s;uch a humour as this is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ubjection and reverence due from a creature to the author of his being, &s;o it would undo him even in heaven could it find a place there. Pre&s;ently ca&s;t him down, as the like it may be did the apo&s;tate angels, and lay
<PB N="285" REF="028262_0286_0FD7F7062DC58B68">him in <HI>chains of darkne&s;s.</HI> We have abundant ev|idence of Scripture revelation, all that God &s;aw fit to grant, and all that is nece&s;&s;ary. He requires in order to believing, an humble, teachable di&s;po&s;i|tion. If in&s;tead of this, we allow our&s;elves un|rea&s;onably to carp and find fault, the guilt of our Infidelity will lie at our own door, and our blood will be upon our own head.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is objected, that notwith&s;tanding all that is &s;aid in behalf of the Bible, and of chri&s;tianity, ma|hometani&s;m pretends to as glorious things, and has &s;pread as much in the world, and yet is a vile im|po&s;ture. But it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, that there is nothing in this objection, could I allow my&s;elf to &s;tay upon it, and to &s;hew that the ca&s;e of chri&s;ti|anity and the religion of Mahomet va&s;tly differ. The one has all the marks of impo&s;ture imaginable in it, and the other none at all. Let me &s;ugge&s;t a few things here.</P>
<P>Mahomet accommodated his religion to the hu|mours of the Arabians, and therefore retained therein &s;uch rites and ceremonies as they were fond of, and had been accu&s;tomed to, and indulged them in &s;uch &s;ins as he found them mo&s;t addicted to. But nothing of this can be charged on chri&s;tianity. Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles &s;trictly forbid all &s;in, requir|ed of all without exception the mortification of their mo&s;t beloved lu&s;ts, cancelled the ancient cere|monies of the Jews, and all the fooli&s;h &s;uper&s;titi|ons of the Heathens. Our Saviour made no allow|ance, granted no indulgence here. And yet his religion prevails again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t corruptions and mo&s;t inveterate prejudices.</P>
<P>Mahomet changed his religion, altered his laws and ceremonies; as he found the humours of the people required. He &s;ometimes e&s;tabli&s;hed one law and manner of wor&s;hip, and then &s;uper&s;eded it; pretending divine revelation for both; though
<PB N="286" REF="028262_0287_0FD7F708A4628F58">they were incon&s;i&s;tent. But Chri&s;t was always the &s;ame and his laws invariable.</P>
<P>Mahomet introduced his religion among a peo|ple of the mo&s;t &s;tupid ignorance, and con&s;equently prepared to receive any delu&s;ions that &s;hould be artfully carried on. It is &s;aid, there was but one per&s;on in Mecca, where he began his forgeries, that could write or read. Whereas, on the other hand, Chri&s;t appeared among the mo&s;t learned people in the world, and when learning was at the greate&s;t height.</P>
<P>Mahomet never dur&s;t venture either upon pro|phecy or miracle; though urged and &s;trongly pre&s;&s;|ed on that head; being con&s;cious of his own inabi|lity. But you know how much of both the&s;e at|tended the mini&s;try, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Further, Mahomet forbad under pain of death all di&s;putes about his religion. Whereas Chri&s;t &s;ub|mitted his to a free examination and enquiry.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the religion of Mahomet owed its &s;up|port to the power of the &s;word, and was by that means propagated. Whereas Chri&s;t and his apo&s;|tles neither had, nor would accept of any &s;uch aux|iliaries and helps. <HI>The weapons</HI> of their <HI>warfare</HI> were <HI>not carnal, but &s;piritual, and mighty through God.</HI></P>
<P>So that though it mu&s;t be granted, that maho|metani&s;m has prevailed in a great part of the world, God having in his ju&s;t judgment given up a peo|ple to &s;trong delu&s;ions, that had the chri&s;tian reli|gion among them, but wofully perverted, and grew weary of it. Though this mu&s;t be acknowledged, it can be no diminution of the honor of the chri&s;|tian religion, or argument again&s;t its divinity, &s;ince it is &s;o evidently of a different nature, and made its way through the world in a very different manner. Several nations believe and receive mahometan|i&s;m,
<PB N="287" REF="028262_0288_0FD7F709D804D590">but &s;uch are &s;ubdued, and the conqueror may impo&s;e what laws he plea&s;es upon the conquered. Once more,</P>
<P N="6">6. It is objected, if the Bible be the word of God, if the chri&s;tian religion be divine, if the Son of God came from heaven, as is related therein, and introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed his religion in the man|ner, as is there pretended, it is &s;trange it has had no greater and better effects in the world. If it be &s;o excellent an in&s;titution; how come they that profe&s;s it to live no better than other people? To this I an&s;wer in a word or two, and I have done with the objections.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Multitudes profe&s;s them|&s;elves chri&s;tians that are not &s;o. And we mu&s;t not judge of chri&s;tianity from the conduct of &s;uch that only u&s;urp the name. Suppo&s;e a company of men &s;hould enter them&s;elves among the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect of philo&s;ophers. Yet if they never acquainted them|&s;elves with their doctrines; never enquired into the precepts, nor regarded the rules of the profe&s;|&s;ion; how excellent &s;oever the in&s;titution was, it could have no influence upon &s;uch votaries. And this is the ca&s;e of large numbers that are called chri&s;|tians. They profe&s;s the Bible, but they know little or nothing of it. They bear the name of Chri&s;t, and pretend to be his followers; but they never received his doctrine, nor his &s;pirit. And, con&s;e|quently, by mea&s;ures ought to be taken from them in judging of the chri&s;tian religion. I an&s;wer,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) Chri&s;tianity has wrought a glorious reforma|tion in the world. That body of men, that receive the Bible, differ as much from the re&s;t of the world, as Jeru&s;alem from Kedar. The church though it has great corruptions, yet has great ex|cellencies; The Scripture, wherever it has come, ever has, in one degree or other, and with re&s;pect to &s;ome at lea&s;t, brought a ble&s;&s;ing along with it. But</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) I confe&s;s, the chri&s;tian religion has not
<PB N="288" REF="028262_0289_0FD7F70C2E60A288">had that effect which might be expected; and I mu&s;t own this is one of tho&s;e providences, that ap|pear to me dark and &s;urpri&s;ing; and, as much as any thing, inclines me to believe there will be a more glorious &s;tate of the church, than we have yet &s;een; when chri&s;tianity will look more like it|&s;elf, and &s;hine forth in the lives of tho&s;e that pro|fe&s;s it with greater lu&s;tre. In the mean time the objection doth not conclude. The world is ex|ceedingly the better for the Bible. I verily be|lieve mo&s;t of the virtue and religion, that remains in a corrupt degenerate world, is owing to it; and is to be found among tho&s;e that embrace and pro|fe&s;s it: and, I doubt not, a time will come when the beauty and power of the chri&s;tian religion will appear more illu&s;trious, than it has yet done; at lea&s;t than now it doth.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Our duty, in the mean time, is to retrieve the credit of our profe&s;&s;ion by the purity, integrity, and holine&s;s of our lives. The chri&s;tian apologi&s;ts in the primitive church (O that we could do it more univer&s;ally now!) u&s;ed to appeal to the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of their religion for the excellency of it; intimating, that their enemies might there behold a beautiful idea of chri&s;tianity. This argument is too much ob&s;cured and lo&s;t among us. Let us &s;tudy every one of us to do our part towards re|covering it, waiting for a more abundant effu&s;ion of the divine &s;pirit to revive decayed religion, in our hearts and in our lives; <HI>that others &s;eeing</HI> our <HI>good works, may glorify</HI> our <HI>Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed the fir&s;t general ob&s;ervation from the text, viz. That all Scripture is given of God. And as I have treated the &s;ubject more at large than I intended, I &s;hall endeavor to make &s;ome amends by a more quick di&s;patch of what re|mains.

It is u&s;eful <HI>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,</HI> and <HI>for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> There is &s;ome difference among the critics about the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words; though mo&s;t I think agree in referring the two fir&s;t to doc|trines, or opinions; the two latter to manners. As thus the Scripture is u&s;eful or profitable for doc|trine, that is, to teach us what to believe: for re|proof, or conviction, namely of errors; it is u&s;eful for correction of faults in practice; and for <HI>in&s;truc|tion in righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that is, in the whole compa&s;s of our duty both towards God and man.

And therefore it is added, <HI>that the man of God may be perfect, tho|roughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</HI> I &s;hall go over the particulars, and begin with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture is profitable for doctrine. And here I &s;hall hint what doctrines the Scripture teaches, and with what advantage it teaches &s;uch doctrines.</P>
<P N="1">1. What doctrines the Scripture teaches. In general, I would &s;ugge&s;t, that the Scripture being
<PB N="290" REF="028262_0291_0FD7F70FF0218498"><HI>in&s;pired of God,</HI> mu&s;t be a &s;ufficient rule of faith, and contain all the nece&s;&s;ary points of divine know|ledge and belief. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that a God of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s &s;hould indite a book on purpo&s;e to direct us in the way to heaven, and yet that book be defective in any nece&s;&s;ary ar|ticle of religion. No; <HI>the Scripture is profitable for doctrine,</HI> for all doctrine. How this is to be under&s;tood, I will let you &s;ee in a few propo&s;iti|ons; therein compri&s;ing what I de&s;ign upon the head.</P>
<P N="1">1. I do not affert, that the Scripture teaches us arts, &s;ciences, and philo&s;ophy. There is indeed a great deal of philo&s;ophy in Scripture, a great deal of rhetoric, and oratory; and many &s;pecimens of curious &s;peculation and learning inter&s;per&s;ed. But there is no &s;y&s;tem of any of the&s;e; much le&s;s a &s;y&s;tem of all of them. The Scripture was wrote or the u&s;e of all &s;orts of per&s;ons; the vulgar and ignorant as well as higher genious's; wrote to in|&s;truct us in the way to heaven, and not in the nice|ties of human learning. It is profitable for doc|trine <HI>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed to all good words;</HI> that the chri&s;tian may be in&s;tructed in every thing that concerns religion, and may be a perfect chri&s;tian; not the philo&s;o|pher in&s;tructed in his theorems, at lea&s;t, not in all of them, or in every problem, that may fall under his examination. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2. Do I &s;uppo&s;e the Scripture teaches the doc|trine of politics. I remark this, becau&s;e I appre|hend it a mi&s;take in &s;ome that treat on this &s;ubject, and that it is attended with ill con&s;equences, to found their doctrine of politics on the Bible. I grant it lays down general rules concerning civil government, and concerning the duty both of ma|gi&s;trates and &s;ubjects. As, that they, that rule over men, mu&s;t be <HI>ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</HI>

And as tho&s;e that are under them, enjoy the protection and many advantages of their admini&s;tration, they are to be <HI>&s;ubject not for wrath,</HI> or merely through fear of puni&s;hment; <HI>but for con|&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> This the Scripture enjoins, and the obligation hereunto is evidently founded upon the nature and rea&s;on of things, and re&s;ults from the very end of &s;ociety. But it doth not determine the nece&s;&s;ary form of civil polity, much le&s;s pre|&s;cribe one and the &s;ame for all &s;tates, and all peo|ple in every age of the world.</P>
<P>Different forms of government are lawful in dif|ferent places, or in the &s;ame place at different times. And, I apprehend, any form of government may be lawful, though not found in Scripture; provid|ed it be fitted to an&s;wer the general ends of go|vernment, and be managed con&s;i&s;tently with Scrip|ture rules. In &s;hort, as God has in nature, and by the mini&s;try and help of human rea&s;on afforded &s;ufficient means for human learning, &s;o far as it is nece&s;&s;ary in the world; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of civil government. It is included in the law of na|ture, the rea&s;on of mankind directs to it, furni&s;hes rules for its management; and it is left to the wi&s;|dom and prudence of every nation or community to choo&s;e the form, to &s;pecify and model it as they plea&s;e. All that the Scripture doth here is only to &s;uperintend it, as I may &s;ay, and pre&s;cribe the duties of the &s;everal parts of &s;ociety in general.</P>
<P>I will not affirm our text po&s;itively excludes the u&s;efulne&s;s of Scripture in things of this kind. But I think, it directs us to expect and attend its teach|ings in things of a different kind. It is u&s;eful for doctrine, <HI>that the man of God may be perfect,</HI> not the
<PB N="292" REF="028262_0293_0FD7F718E24E2290">politician; at lea&s;t, that he may be perfect as a chri&s;tian, not as a politician. The Scripture de&s;|cribes God's church, gives us the plan and form of that, and lays down rules for the management of it; teaches how to govern our hearts, and order our lives and conver&s;ations; that we may be fitted for the heavenly hierarchy, the city above. But it doth not meddle &s;o much with the affairs of this world, as to lay down a &s;y&s;tem of politics. Here human wi&s;dom, and human laws, have the chief intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. When it is &s;aid the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, we mu&s;t not under&s;tand it, that it teaches us every thing about the doctrines of religion, that our curio&s;ity may lead us to enquire after, There are a great many doctrines that men have brought into religion, which the Scripture &s;aith nothing of. They are mere human figments, and framed out of their own heads. But as the Scripture is not profitable for the&s;e doctrines, I think we may with clearne&s;s and authority infer, the doctrines them|&s;elves are not profitable. Of this &s;ort are a multi|tude of the doctrines the church of Rome would obtrude upon us under the notion of traditions. I may add, of this &s;ort are many &s;peculations, upon which no &s;mall &s;tre&s;s has been laid, in prote&s;t|ant churches, and which they borrowed from the &s;chools.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve, that in the doctrines the Scrip|ture doth reveal, even in the mo&s;t important of them, there is a re&s;erve. It teaches us &s;omething of them, but not every thing that belongs to this or that &s;ubject. It acquaints us with all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ground our faith, and direct our practice; but not all we may de&s;ire to gratify our curio&s;ity. It gives us, for in&s;tance, the mo&s;t excellent notion of the divine being. But as his nature is un&s;earch|able, there are an hundred que&s;tions men indulge
<PB N="293" REF="028262_0294_0FD7F71ADA0E8070">them&s;elves in with reference to it, wherein it af|fords us no light and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It teaches us the doctrine of the trinity, that &s;ub|lime and di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrine of the chri&s;tian religion. But then it doth not de&s;cend to all the particulars, the nice que&s;tions, and bold deci&s;ions, with which we have, if I mi&s;take not, perplexed and ob&s;cured it. The Scripture is profitable for this doctrine. And the doctrine is a very profitable and comfortable one, if we will be content with what it teaches. But if we leave our guide here, and pretend to be wi&s;e above what is written, we &s;hall &s;oon find our&s;elves out of our depth, and to our own and others prejudices, <HI>darken council with words without knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of many other doctrines of the Bible; as the doctrine of God's decrees, the &s;tate of future happine&s;s, the re&s;urrection, the na|ture, quality, and circum&s;tances of the re&s;urrection body, the condition of angels, their order, govern|ment, officers, and the like. God has in great wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s afforded us a revelation, in which he in&s;tructs us in all things he thought proper and convenient for us, and &s;o far as they are &s;o. He con&s;iders our occa&s;ions, nece&s;&s;ities, and capacities; and accommodates him&s;elf thereunto. The be&s;t here, <HI>know but in part, prophecy but in part;</HI> and, indeed, how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, when God hath revealed things to us but in part. Let us therefore confine our&s;elves within the limits God hath &s;et us, be thankful he has revealed &s;o much; be con|tented that he has revealed no more. The Scrip|ture revelation is &s;ufficient to employ our mo&s;t di|ligent enquiries, at the &s;ame time that it mu&s;t bound them. The apo&s;tle cen&s;ures &s;ome for <HI>intruding into things they had not &s;een;</HI> referring to the doc|trine of angels, into which it &s;eems they pried and &s;earched, as the word &s;ignifies; pretending to know
<PB N="294" REF="028262_0295_0FD7F7E24C6923A8">what the Scripture has not taught concerning them. Let us be cautions and mode&s;t here; receive the doctrines the Scripture has delivered, and as they are delivered there; believe what the Scripture has told us of this or that doctrine; but not take upon us to know what it has not told us; proceeding in our a&s;&s;ertions and deci&s;ions, where the Scripture does not go before us, with its light and in&s;truction. This humor has occa&s;ioned no &s;mall mi&s;chief to the church; and indeed is the &s;ource of the mo&s;t of tho&s;e contentions that have di&s;turbed its peace.</P>
<P N="4">4. When it is &s;aid, the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, the lea&s;t it can intend, is, that it contains all nece&s;&s;ary doctrine for us to know and believe, in order to &s;alvation. This may be concluded from its being in&s;pired. Certainly if it be given by in&s;piration of God, and delivered to the church as a divine rule, it is not a defective and imperfect rule. Nor are we left to infer this, and make it out by rea&s;oning. We find the Scripture often a&s;&s;ert|ing its own &s;ufficiency. Our apo&s;tle in this chap|ter, referring to the Scripture of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, at lea&s;t chiefly, &s;ays, they are <HI>able to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</HI> And if &s;o, they mu&s;t include every nece&s;&s;ary article of faith. And when in the text he affirms, <HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,</HI> &amp;c. He adds, <HI>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed to all good works.</HI> This, as I ob&s;erved, is a&s;&s;erted of the Old Te&s;tament. And we have the &s;ame abun|dantly proved, with re&s;pect to the New. Chri&s;t told his di&s;ciples, that he had <HI>made known all things,</HI> he had <HI>heard of the Father.</HI> And when he was about to leave them, he a&s;&s;ures them, he would <HI>&s;end</HI> the <HI>&s;pirit, who</HI> &s;hould <HI>teach</HI> them <HI>all things, and bring all things to</HI> their <HI>remembrance, what&s;oever</HI> he had <HI>&s;aid to</HI> them. That the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> &s;hould <HI>guide</HI> them <HI>into all truth.</HI> Now it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that as
<PB N="295" REF="028262_0296_0FD7DAEC399C6DA8">the apo&s;tles had a commi&s;&s;ion, being thus furni&s;hed and in&s;tructed to go, and pro&s;elyte <HI>all nations,</HI> and <HI>teach them all things what&s;oever</HI> their ma&s;ter had <HI>commanded</HI> them; &s;o they committed the&s;e things to writing, for the future u&s;e and &s;ervice of the church. So that in the holy Scripture we have all nece&s;&s;ary doctrines of religion. What Chri&s;t heard of the Father, that is, concerning the way and me|thod of man's &s;alvation, this he communicated to his apo&s;tles. This the &s;pirit in them, revived, con|firmed, and commented upon. This they preach|ed to the world. The apo&s;tle Paul tells the Ephe|&s;ians, he had <HI>not &s;hunned to deciare unto</HI> them <HI>all the council of God.</HI> And this doctrine, the whole and entire doctrine, they communicated to the world in in&s;pired writings, which I have proved are the very &s;ame, that we, by the good providence of God, have in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Scripture we enjoy is profitable for doctrine, and &s;ufficient for all di|vine and &s;aving doctrine. He that &s;tudies, under|&s;tands, and believes his Bible, and lives according to it, is <HI>wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Scripture is profitable not only for ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary doctrines, but it teaches us many other things for our greater improvement and com|fort in religion, there is no book, no chapter, no doctrine of the Bible, but what is u&s;eful in its place, and for its proper end and purpo&s;e. But we mu&s;t not &s;ay, that it is all nece&s;&s;ary; that if we had wanted any, we could not have been chri&s;tians; the con&s;equence of which would be, that if we are ignorant of any, we cannot be chri&s;tians. And then how few would be approved? For who is ac|quainted with every part of the Bible; knows and under&s;tands it all. As in the natural body, there are &s;ome parts more e&s;&s;ential, nece&s;&s;ary, and vital; others that have their proper office in the body, and highly u&s;eful, but not of equal nece&s;&s;ity with
<PB N="296" REF="028262_0297_0FD7DAF12285D078">the more noble parts. A man would be maimed, imperfect, and uncomfortable without them; but yet might live without them. Thus it is in the body of Scripture doctrines and revelations. It has its vital and e&s;&s;ential points; and the&s;e are of|ten inculcated, delivered over and over again, in one place and another; and indeed in a multitude of places: that as all are concerned in them, none that are competently attentive and inqui&s;itive, may mi&s;s them, and overlook them. Be&s;ide the&s;e, there are a great many doctrines in the Bible that &s;erve to enlarge and confirm our faith, to enrich our minds with a trea&s;ure of divine truths; to excite and employ our devotion. It delivers many doc|trines of eminent u&s;e, which yet cannot be &s;aid to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; that tend to adorn and perfect the chri&s;tian's faith, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and conduct him in all the parts of the divine and &s;piritual life, and it highly concerns us to attend to the&s;e.</P>
<P>Some people, I have ob&s;erved, notwith&s;tanding the veneration they profe&s;s for the Bible; content them&s;elves with a very &s;canty knowledge of it. They learn a &s;hort creed, or &s;ome of the general abridgments of duty contained in the Scripture; as, that it is required of us that we <HI>do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God:</HI> Or that of our Saviour, <HI>What&s;oever</HI> we <HI>would that men &s;hould do to</HI> us, we mu&s;t <HI>do</HI> even <HI>&s;o to them;</HI> that <HI>he who believeth &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> and the like. The&s;e and &s;uch like maxims and general propo&s;itions they receive; and it is the &s;tock of Scripture knowledge they &s;et up with. All that is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ay they, lies in a little compa&s;s; is ea&s;y and plain; and as they per|&s;uade them&s;elves they have &s;ufficiently learned that, they enquire no farther. But the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould con&s;ider that a little knowledge of the doctrines of the Bible is not &s;ufficient, and all that is nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e that are capable and have opportunity for
<PB N="297" REF="028262_0298_0FD7DAF36AD55CD0">under&s;tanding more. Fundamentals are different according to the different &s;tate of per&s;ons. That ignorance which is excu&s;able in one, I que&s;tion not is de&s;tructive in another.</P>
<P>And then, a good mea&s;ure of diligence and care is requi&s;ite to the under&s;tanding aright even tho&s;e few plain and important doctrines of religion that the&s;e per&s;ons think &s;ufficient. A man, it is grant|ed, may &s;oon learn the propo&s;itions that contain the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of faith. But the doctrines them&s;elves are not &s;o ea&s;ily learned as they may imagine. To in&s;tance in one of the propo&s;itions I mentioned before: <HI>he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Before we can under&s;tand that, we mu&s;t know what faith is; and in order to this we mu&s;t be acquaint|ed with the great objects thereof, as God, Chri&s;t, the Holy Spirit, the in&s;pired Scriptures: we mu&s;t know God in his nature, attributes, and relations to us; Chri&s;t in his mediation and offices; the Spirit in his work and office; the revelation that God has made of him&s;elf in his word. Faith re&s;|pects all the&s;e; and no man can be &s;aid to believe that doth not in &s;ome degree know what he is to be|lieve; I might add, and upon what grounds. Be|&s;ides, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the &s;everal acts of faith, its properties, and effects; the &s;alvation promi&s;ed to it; what it is, what it includes: and here is a large field, great &s;cope for our enquiry and &s;tudy, and which will nece&s;&s;arily lead the chri&s;tian to a frequent, diligent conver&s;ation with his Bible. So that however ea&s;y, how few &s;oever, the e&s;&s;ential, nece&s;&s;ary doctrines of religion are, it is certain they cannot be learned without the Bible, nor without a faithful, and diligent u&s;e of it. They do not re|quire indeed a great capacity, and &s;trength of ge|nius in every one to under&s;tand them; but they require an humble, teachable di&s;po&s;ition, an hone&s;t
<PB N="298" REF="028262_0299_0FD7DAF4691ED718">heart, and a diligent &s;erious &s;earch, according to every one's ability.</P>
<P>Again, according to the principle the per&s;ons, I am now concerned with, act upon, I cannot &s;ee but the greate&s;t part of Scripture is rendered u&s;ele&s;s. If no more be nece&s;&s;ary than a few &s;hort, general propo&s;itions; why did God indict a book &s;o copi|ous, and full of divine matter? Commit it as a fa|vor and tru&s;t to the care of his church? if a few &s;hort &s;entences and propo&s;itions, be all that are needful and u&s;eful, what &s;erves the re&s;t of the Bi|ble for? why was it given? and how will the&s;e per|&s;ons reconcile their notion with the reverence they pretend to of the holy Scripture and its author.</P>
<P>However, if but a little of the Bible be ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary; the re&s;t is highly u&s;eful and valuable, and therefore &s;hould not be neglected. And it mu&s;t argue a vile contempt of &s;acred truths to de&s;pi&s;e any of them under a pretence they are not nece&s;&s;a|ry; that we may be chri&s;tians without them; be &s;aved without them. We do not act at this rate in &s;ecular concerns, are not content with ju&s;t &s;o much food as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport life; with &s;uch at|tire as is barely nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the end of cloathing; nor with &s;o much e&s;tate as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;i&s;t us. And why &s;hould we act &s;o in the affairs of religion? I am afraid this modera|tion doth dot proceed from a nicer head in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing what is mo&s;t important in &s;acred things; but from a di&s;temper of heart that leads us to de&s;|pi&s;e them. David no doubt under&s;tood, as well as mo&s;t others, the e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary doctrines of religion; had well dige&s;ted them, and was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; and yet how vigorous was his de&s;ire after divine knowledge? how diligently did he pur&s;ue the &s;tudy of divine &s;ubjects? that part of &s;acred revelation, which God had then favored the church with, was his con&s;tant meditation and de|light.
<PB N="299" REF="028262_0300_0FD7F71BD3802830">Read cxix P&s;al, and you will &s;ee the temper of that great and good man with re&s;pect to the law of God, or that &s;y&s;tem of revelation the church then had. And if you rightly compare his &s;pirit and your own, I am per&s;uaded you mu&s;t either cen|&s;ure David or your&s;elves; and I leave you to con|&s;ider which is mo&s;t rea&s;onable. I have &s;taid the longer upon this matter, though it may look like a digre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e I apprehend the di&s;cour&s;e &s;ea|&s;onable to &s;ome, and that there may be occa&s;ion for admonition and caution here.</P>
<P>But to return, the Bible, I &s;ay, teaches us not only all that is nece&s;&s;ary, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but many other things for our greater improvement and comfort. It gives us an entire &s;y&s;tem of di|vine truths. You cannot expect I &s;hould enumer|ate them; though it may be proper to offer a few general hints.</P>
<P>The Scripture delivers to us the great doctrines concerning God; his nature and attributes; his relations to us, and government over us; concern|ing the trinity of per&s;ons in the godhead; concern|ing providence and the properties of it; that it is con&s;tant, &s;overeign, univer&s;al, reaches to all per&s;ons and things, and circum&s;tances of things. It deli|vers to us, the doctrine of the creation: that the world was made, by whom, when, in what time, or|der, and the like: the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of man in innocence; his fall, &s;entence, and con|demnation. It acquaints us with the provi&s;ion God made for the relief of apo&s;tate man, by the promi&s;ed &s;eed. It teaches us the great doctrines of morality; which we have abridged in the deca|louge, commented upon in the Old Te&s;tament, and more fully in the New. It acquaints us with the great and glorious tran&s;actions of the Mediator; lays before us the plan and &s;cheme of our redemp|tion
<PB N="300" REF="028262_0301_0FD7F7220E08AE90">as it was accompli&s;hed by him; gives us an account of his incarnation, life, doctrine and mira|cles, his death, re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;itting at the right hand of God; with the beneficial offices he &s;u&s;tains and executes. It acquaints us with the new covenant in the la&s;t edition of it; its duties and privileges; the office of the Spirit; his gifts, graces, and con&s;olations, with all the &s;ublime and excellent rules and laws delivered to the church by the Son of God incarnate; and by his mini&s;ters. It makes known a future heaven, and in &s;ome men|&s;ure unvails the glories of it. Thus the Scripture is profitable for doctrine. It delivers all the great important doctrines of religion; and that &s;o fully and particularly, that if we receive its in&s;truction; we cannot be ignorant of any thing nece&s;&s;ary for us to know.</P>
<P>I would here ob&s;erve, that the&s;e things are con|tained in &s;ereral parts of the Bible, and often re|peated there. The Old Te&s;tament has the fame doctrines with the New; that more ob&s;curely, this with greater clearne&s;s and explication. Mo&s;es &s;peaks of Chri&s;t though with a vail on his face The one was a preparatory di&s;pen&s;ation, and in|cluded very much the &s;ame things with our go&s;pel, but under types, and &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations. In &s;hort both had the &s;ame religion. But we have it in a more perfect &s;tate, and in a clearer light.</P>
<P>I might farther take notice that whatever &s;ome may object to the contrary; there is a great deal of method and order in Scripture. It begins with an account of the original of all things; with the &s;tate of innocency, the fall of man, the early di&s;covery of God's purpo&s;e of grace. It proceeds to ac|quaint us how the world was peopled; with its de|generacy; with the choice of a family, that of A|braham, which God inclo&s;ed as his church; and the progenitors of the Me&s;&s;ials. It gives an account
<PB N="301" REF="028262_0302_0FD7F7239763B778">of the particular revelations God made to this fa|mily from time to time, gradually; and of the laws and ordinances e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, of the ma|ny additionnal hints concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; the types and prophecies that in&s;ured him till the <HI>ful|ne&s;s of time</HI> came, and <HI>God &s;ent forth his Son made of of woman.</HI> The New Te&s;tament begins with his pedigree, genealogy and birth; carries us through at the circum&s;tances of his life, his death and re|&s;urrection; gives us the hi&s;tory of the church in the fir&s;t age of it; its con&s;titution, laws, and admi|ni&s;tration; and foretells the &s;tate thereof in after ages.</P>
<P>In a word, though the doctrine of Scripture be not delivered in the method of our &s;y&s;tems, there is a great deal of beauty even in the method of it. And I dare &s;ay, whoever will &s;tudy it with compe|tent helps, and with humility, diligence, and a &s;uita|ble reverence of God; with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> deference a worm owes to infinite wi&s;dom; will find him&s;elf not a little in&s;tructed and entertained, and his faith con|&s;umed and e&s;tabli&s;hed: will &s;ee cau&s;e to admire even the method of Scripture doctrines, which the proud and cen&s;orious &s;o much carp at.</P>
<P>You will allow me to make a remark or two un|der the other head, and I have done, viz.</P>
<P N="2">2. With what advantage the Scripture teaches us the&s;e things; it is <HI>profitable for doctrine:</HI> and it is in a &s;pecial manner &s;o; more &s;o than any other book, exceeds all other revelations; and no won|der, when it is <HI>given by in&s;piration of God.</HI> It may be expected a book from heaven &s;hould appear with bright and di&s;tingui&s;hing characters upon it; and that it &s;hould teach in a way worthy of its au|thor. And thus doth the holy Scripture. This has been &s;hewn in part already in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;es. I &s;hall only touch a few things here ju&s;t to let you into my meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="028262_0303_0FD7F72C6FDD3C20">
The Scripture teaches us many doctrine that we could not otherwi&s;e have known: as the fall of man, the original of &s;in, the trinity of divine per&s;ons in the godhead, the incarnation, and whole doctrine of the mediator, the offices of Chri&s;t, and of the &s;pirit, and indeed every thing that is properly go&s;|pel: the entire method of our intercour&s;e with God through a redeemer. All this, with all its particulars, we owe to Scripture revelation. And then,</P>
<P>The things that we might otherwi&s;e have under|&s;tood &s;omething of, the Scripture teaches more fully and certainly. I might in&s;tance in the crea|tion and whole &s;cheme of providence. It is known and I took notice of it before; how darkly and confu&s;edly the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers talked upon the&s;e &s;ubjects. Some thought the world was made by chance; others thought it was not made at all, but was eternal. Some denied all providence; others confined it to the heavens, leaving this lower world to its own care and government. And all of them &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed providence and limited it, as to make it a very u&s;ele&s;s and uncomfortable doctrine at be&s;t, if indeed it imported any thing. I might carry the like remark through a great many other in&s;tances; as the attributes of God, the immortality of the &s;oul, and a future &s;tate of rewards and pun|i&s;hments. The&s;e &s;ubjects the philo&s;ophers, who cultivated natural religion, talked of; but plainly di&s;covered they knew very little of them. They talked backward and forward, as men in the dark, that could not tell what to &s;ay, or what to believe.</P>
<P>But the Scripture is profitable for doctrine. It comes in here for our relief, and in a few texts &s;catters all the&s;e mi&s;ts, and gives a &s;atisfaction in the&s;e great points, that in vain we &s;eek for in all the books of the philo&s;ophers. One of the ancient fathers triumphs on this head in behalf of the Bible.
<PB N="303" REF="028262_0304_0FD7F72F063E7320"><Q>By virtue, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> of faith, and the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, ru&s;tics and mechanics exceed the deepe&s;t philo&s;ophers. A&s;k a boy educated in the chri&s;tian religion, who made him? he will tell you God, which is more than Ari&s;to|tle or Democritus would have told. Demand of him, why he was made? he will an&s;wer to glori|fy God. And hardly would Plato or Pythago|ras have replied &s;o wi&s;ely. A&s;k him concerning his &s;oul, he will tell you, it is immortal, mu&s;t be judged according to the deeds done in the body, and be happy or mi&s;erable forever. About which points &s;uch great men as Socrates and Se|neca could &s;ay nothing po&s;itively. So much are we beholden to the Bible, and &s;o great the ad|vantages we receive by it. It clears difficulties in &s;uch doctrines, that the greate&s;t men in the world, de&s;titute of its light, were puzzled with, and delivers the great things of religion to us with extraordinary clearne&s;s and certainty.</Q></P>
<P>I might add, it teaches with great ea&s;e. The philo&s;ophers &s;cheme of natural religion, as it was very imperfect, and uncertain to them&s;elves gene|rally; &s;o it was hammered out with much pains and labor. But divine doctrine di&s;tills as the dew; and the Scripture comment makes all the rules and principles, they di&s;puted &s;o much, plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it teaches with authority. God's &s;pi|rit is promi&s;ed to accompany the Scripture revela|tion. It did &s;o, in &s;ome degree, under the former part of it, the Old Te&s;tament: It does &s;o more eminently under the New; which is therefore cal|led, <HI>the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit.</HI> And his office is not only to reveal the object, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t the eye, to remove prejudices, open the heart, enlighten the mind, and carry home divine truths to the con&s;ci|ences of men. And indeed the more glorious ef|fects of Scripture, are owing to the concurrence
<PB N="304" REF="028262_0305_0FD7F7312B050FC0">and influence of the Holy Spirit. The Bible is his book and allow me to &s;ay, he continues to be the teacher of it. O let us wait for, and depend on his in&s;truction. You have heard how much you owe to the Bible, and what u&s;e you are to make of it. Be thankful for it, improve it for the purpo&s;es it was given; read it often, and diligently ac|quaint your&s;elves with all its doctrines; and while you do &s;o, beg for divine in&s;truction, that the Holy Spirit may unvail your eyes, that you <HI>may behold wondrous things out of God's law.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE XII. THE SCRIPTURE SHEWN TO BE PROFITABLE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TWO things I ob&s;erved in the&s;e words, namely, the divine in&s;piration, and great u&s;efulne&s;s of the Scriptures; and having treated &s;omewhat largely concerning the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I proceeded to con&s;ider the other, which I entered upon in my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. The propo&s;ition I laid down, is, <HI>that the holy Scriptures, or the in&s;pired wrilings of the Old and New Te&s;tament, are of great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e to the church.</HI> Where I propo&s;ed to &s;peak of the u&s;eful|ne&s;s of the &s;everal parts thereof. In con&s;ider|ing the former point, I told you, I would confine my&s;elf to the particulars &s;pecified in the text, and make it appear that it is <HI>profitable,</HI> or u&s;eful, <HI>for doc|trine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Scripture is <HI>profitable for doctrine.</HI> This I have already &s;hewn you, &s;ugge&s;ting what doc|trines the Scripture teaches, and with what advan|tage it teaches &s;uch doctrines. And now I go on to the next particular.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Scripture is <HI>profitable for reproof,</HI> for
<PB N="306" REF="028262_0307_0FD7F733671D4E40">conviction of errors, as I before took notice. The word is under&s;tood by many in this place. And, indeed, this does not &s;eem &s;o much a new and ano|ther property of the Scripture, as a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of the former. As the Scripture is the rule and mea&s;ure of truth, teaches us all nece&s;&s;ary truth; what we are to believe and know in order to &s;alvation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> loth in con&s;equence hereof, detect error, and &s;hew us what we are to reject; what is contrary to this rule, is fal&s;e; what is beyond it, is &s;uperfluous; and what is &s;hort of it, is defective.</P>
<P>So that here I have a fit occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ufficiency and perfection of the holy Scriptures. But as I have detained you too long in &s;peculation already, I &s;hall not handle the &s;ubject in a controver&s;ial way, nor trouble you with the arguments or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avils of the church of Rome upon this head, who, as they &s;et up another rule be&s;ides, and contrary to the Scriptures; &s;o they advance a great many things highly derogatory and di&s;honor|able thereto. But that I may di&s;patch what re|mains in a di&s;cour&s;e or two, as is my intention, I &s;hall not enter upon a debate with them; only of|fer a few remarks for clearing the propo&s;ition be|fore us. The Scripture <HI>is profitable for reproof,</HI> or u&s;eful to detect and di&s;cover errors, doctrinal er|rors. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me ob&s;erve, that we mu&s;t not extend it too far. It is not profitable for reproof and conviction of error in all ca&s;es, as in philo&s;ophy, polities, and the like. It is no argument that this or that problem in philo&s;ophy, this or that theorem in mathematics, is fal&s;e, becau&s;e not taught in Scripture; or that this or that &s;y&s;tem of politics is wrong, becau&s;e we do not find it there. The rea|&s;on is, the Scripture was not wrote to in&s;truct us in the&s;e things, nor doth it deliver all the doctrines that concern them. The u&s;efulne&s;s of Scripture
<PB N="307" REF="028262_0308_0FD7F733DB782290">for reproof, is parallel to its u&s;efulne&s;s for doctrine. It extends as far in the one ca&s;e as in the other: but no further. In &s;hort, it teaches the doctrines of religion, and convinces of errors in religion, but not in human &s;ciences.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Scripture is a divine rule given by in|&s;piration of God, all tho&s;e doctrines that are con|trary thereto, or incon&s;i&s;tent therewith, are con|demned by it, they fall under its reproof and cen|&s;ure. We mu&s;t have recour&s;e <HI>to the law and to the te&s;timony, whoever &s;peaketh not according to this rule, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI> The Scripture is the &s;tandard of divine doctrines, and whatever is advanced in religion, by whom&s;oever, or by what authority &s;oever, if it doth not con&s;i&s;t therewith, it is to be rejected; it is an error, the Scripture re|proves and convicts it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Thus the doctrine of Polythei&s;m, or of many gods, with the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice paid them, which over&s;pread the heathen world, is reproved in Scrip|ture, which teaches us that there is but one God. The doctrine of the unitarians, that deny three divine per&s;ons in the godhead, is reproved there al&s;o. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the doctrine of the Pelagians, that deny original &s;in, contrary to that of the apo&s;tle, <HI>by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> And again, <HI>by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.</HI> And <HI>by one man's di&s;obedience, many were made &s;in|ners.</HI> The Scripture is profitable for reproof here. If any &s;hall (as many have both formerly, and at this day) que&s;tion this doctrine on account of the difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s of it, they &s;tand convicted and reproved by the holy Scripture. Thus God has taught in his word, and we are not to oppo&s;e our rea&s;oning to our rule. The doctrine of the Antinomians,
<PB N="308" REF="028262_0309_0FD7F7379D423818">that di&s;charge men from any obligation to the mo|ral law, making it void as a rule of life, and &s;ub&s;ti|tuting, what they call faith, in&s;tead of obedience; this al&s;o is reproved in Scripture, not only in a few texs, but it is indeed contrary to the &s;cope and de&s;ign of the whole of it. The doctrine of the Semi-Pelagians, or more rigid Arminians, that de|ny &s;pecial grace, the immediate concurrence, oper|ation, and influence of the Holy Spirit, is reproved there likewi&s;e. The apo&s;tle, I think, under&s;tood nothing of their doctrine, if he under&s;tood his own motto, as I may call it, <HI>by the grace of God I am what I am.</HI> He adds, <HI>I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</HI> And again, <HI>it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure.</HI> If it be &s;ugge&s;ted, that we are rea&s;oning creatures, capable of judging what is right, and chu&s;ing what is be&s;t. I grant all this: but then, I &s;ay, we are &s;inful, depraved creatures, and &s;tand in need of the grace of God, of &s;upernatural help and influences; this the Scripture teaches, and this, I think, every good man's experience confirms.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance in a multitude of doctrines, that the Romani&s;ts brought into the church, and by which they have in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner corrupted the chri&s;tian religion; as the doctrine of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, expre&s;sly confuted by our Saviour, who calls the bread in the &s;acrament bread &s;everal times, even after con&s;ecration. They &s;ay, no bread re|mains, but that it is turned into the body of Chri&s;t. Now if the Scripture be true, this doctrine is fal&s;e. So their doctrine concerning wor&s;hipping &s;aints and angels, concerning many mediators, to whom they make application for &s;uccour and relief, the Scripture reproves, when it commands us to <HI>wor|&s;hip the Lord our God;</HI> telling us, that <HI>him only</HI> mu&s;t we <HI>&s;erve.</HI> And a&s;&s;ures us, there is but <HI>one mediator
<PB N="309" REF="028262_0310_0FD7F739E54123D0">between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> I might mention &s;everal other doctrines, as the &s;a|crifice of the ma&s;s, their doctrine of merit, indul|gence, communion in one kind, denying the cup to the laity, and the like. All which are contrary to Scripture, and cannot be received without in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enching upon, and indeed de&s;troying its authority is a rule of faith and practice. And, to mention no more, what &s;hall we &s;ay of their Latin &s;ervice, or praying in an unknown tongue, which is a direct contradiction to what the apo&s;tle teaches and en|joins, 1. Cor. xiv. If the apo&s;tle was herein in|&s;pired, we may be &s;ure the&s;e new teachers are far from infallible, whatever they pretend, and that their doctrine is fal&s;e and erroneous.</P>
<P>In a word, the Scripture being given by in&s;pira|tion of God, is a &s;acred rule, a divine &s;tandard and mea&s;ure of doctrines; and whoever would impo&s;e upon us any articles of faith, or rules of wor&s;hip, that cannot bear an examination thereby, or that contradicts our rule, are to be rejected.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the Scripture is a complete and perfect rule, &s;o all doctrines that are be&s;ides this rule, and not included in it, come under reproof. It is ar|gument enough again&s;t them that they are not taught there. Of this nature are many circum&s;tan|ces of divine doctrines, in which we are apt to add to the word of God, under a pretence of explaining it. I might in&s;tance in the free and too bold, as I apprehend it, explications of the doctrine of the trinity, the incarnation, the per&s;onal union of the word, with the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the rea&s;ons and ends of infinite wi&s;dom in the mediation of Chri&s;t and attonement made by him, the manner of the &s;pirit's operations upon the &s;ouls of men, the nature and &s;everal ingredients of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, the manner and quality of the re&s;urrection of the body. I am mi&s;taken if the Scripture be not profitable for
<PB N="310" REF="028262_0311_0FD7F73C8B9558E8">reproof here, if we would harken to it. It reveals the&s;e doctrines, but it doth not reveal all we may be inqi&s;itive to know about them, and if we in&s;ert in our explications what the Scripture doth not war|rant, in&s;ert as nece&s;&s;ary parts of the&s;e doctrines, we are expo&s;ed to the reproof and cen&s;ure thereof. For if that be a perfect rule, it needs not our &s;up|plements, and when we go beyond it in our doc|trines we offend as well as when we go contrary to it.</P>
<P>I add, as &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;s by &s;upplying circum|&s;tances of divine doctrines, &s;o others by inventing new doctrines, about which the Scripture &s;ays no|thing at all. In which re&s;pect the Romani&s;ts are notoriou&s;ly guilty. They <HI>teach for doctrines the commandments of men.</HI> As in their doctrine con|cerning the head&s;hip and &s;overeignty of the Pope, infallibility, the &s;even &s;acraments, and the re&s;t of the twelve additional articles of their Trent creed. The Scripture reproves the&s;e doctrines and con|vinces them of error. They a&s;k &s;ometimes, where doth the Scripture condemn them? but &s;uppo&s;ing we could not &s;hew them where they are condemn|ed, as often we can; it is &s;ufficient that it doth not command them, hath not revealed them. <HI>The Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is pro|fitable for doctrine, for reproof, &amp;c.</HI> The apo&s;tle adds, <HI>that the man of God might be perfect, thorough|ly furni&s;hed to all good works,</HI> Now, how &s;hould <HI>the man of God be perfect</HI> by the help of Scripture, if any thing nece&s;&s;ary for his knowledge and belief, was wanting therein. It cannot be a rule to us, nor can we conclude it given by in&s;piration of God, if it doth not teach us all that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the Scripture is a divine and perfect rule, &s;o it is a nece&s;&s;ary rule. We are not to receive doctrines contrary to it, nor ingraft doctrines upon
<PB N="311" REF="028262_0312_0FD7F73F6AC6A348">it, and add them thereto; no more mu&s;t we ne|glect the doctrines it teaches. <HI>Go forth,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his apo&s;tles in their commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>and di&s;ciple all nations, teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI> We mu&s;t not make any thing nece&s;&s;ary, which the Scripture has not taught and made nece&s;&s;ary; neither mu&s;t we overlook and di&s;pen&s;e with any thing it has taught and made ne|ce&s;&s;ary. A great many are reproved here by the authority of the Scripture, as well as in the other particulars mentioned before. We have gro&s;s in|&s;tances of this with reference to the &s;acraments. Some, you know, deny both of them, water-bapti&s;m as they call it, and the Lord's &s;upper? though we have the in&s;titution of both in Scripture, and that in mo&s;t expre&s;s terms; and have both recommended to us by the con&s;tant practice of the apo&s;tles and primitive church. Others, though they own the &s;acraments, yet take a liberty with them to change and model them at plea&s;ure. Thus, when Chri&s;t in the in&s;titution of his &s;upper delivered the cup as well as the bread, and &s;aid, <HI>drink ye all of it,</HI> they with a &s;trange pre&s;umption interpo&s;e here, and forbid the cup to the laity. The&s;e errors the Scripture condemns and reproves. Nor can I &s;ee it is con&s;i&s;tent with the veneration we owe to it as an in&s;pired writing to a&s;&s;ume this liberty to our|&s;elves of di&s;pen&s;ing with its rules. If it be a divine revelation we mu&s;t neither add to it, nor take from it. I may add,</P>
<P N="5">5. The Scripture is profitable for reproof and confutation of practical errors, as well as &s;uch as are doctrinal, as we call them, and &s;uch as are more &s;peculative. It delivers a great many divine maxims for the government of the hearts and lives of men, and con&s;equently lays open &s;uch errors as are contrary thereto. Thus that fatal error of co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, or dividing our affections between God
<PB N="312" REF="028262_0313_0FD7F73FD2DE3728">and the creature, is condemned by that pa&s;&s;age, <HI>thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, with all thy might, and with all thy mind;</HI> by that of the apo&s;tle, <HI>love not the world nei|ther the things that are in the world; for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> an indifference and coolne&s;s in religion, preferring any pre&s;ent little intere&s;t to that of our &s;ouls, is re|proved by that Scripture, that bids us, <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all other things &s;hall be added to us,</HI> by that which bids us, <HI>labor not for the meat which peri&s;hes, but for that which endures to everla&s;ting life.</HI> And by that which cen&s;ures the unrea&s;onable &s;olicitude of Martha, even when &s;he was mini&s;tering to the Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf, <HI>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and trou|bled about many things, but one thing is needful.</HI></P>
<P>There are certain divine principles of wi&s;dom and religion recommended in the word of God, by which it not only directs us in our choice and con|duct, but reproves and cen&s;ures us when we act contrary thereto. O endeavor to attend to the ad|monition and reproof of the Scripture, bring your hearts under the authority of God's word: believe, choo&s;e, and act according to the precepts and rules of it. Admit nothing contrary to it as a doctrine of religion, nothing be&s;ides it, nor neglect any thing in it. We are to receive it as a divine, perfect and nece&s;&s;ary rule; and &s;ubmit to its reproof in all things as we &s;tand obnoxious thereto. It follows,</P>
<P N="3">III. The Scripture is <HI>profitable for correction.</HI> This, as I ob&s;erved before, refers to manners: it corrects the di&s;orders in the conver&s;ation. Con|cerning which let me ob&s;erve a few things briefly.</P>
<P>It condemns all &s;in without exception, and grants no indulgence to any iniquity. <HI>The law of God is perfect, converting the &s;oul,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 7. It is per|&s;ect in this re&s;pect, as it &s;earches out all iniquity,
<PB N="313" REF="028262_0314_0FD7F74040F262C8">points it out and cen&s;ures it, and if we harken to its admonitions and teachings, converts the &s;oul from it. Hence it follows, ver. 11. that the P&s;alm|i&s;t, &s;peaking of the judgments or &s;tatutes of the Lord, adds: <HI>Moreover by them is thy &s;ervant warned;</HI> warned of &s;in, and warned of danger. This pro|perty is often a&s;cribed to the holy Scripture, or word of God, particularly in P&s;. cxix. <HI>Thy word,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>have I hid in my heart, that I might not &s;in again&s;t thee,</HI> ver. 11. And again, ver. 9. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</HI> The word of God is a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t &s;in, when it is received with faith and trea&s;ured up in the heart, as a go|verning principle there. It helps to clean&s;e the way and cour&s;e both of young and old. The rules and maxims of the moral philo&s;ophers were in &s;ome things <HI>profitable for correction.</HI> They laid down many excellent rules for the government of the pa&s;&s;ions; but with &s;uch a mixture and alloy of &s;in|ful tolerations, that their be&s;t &s;y&s;tems were altoge|ther in&s;ufficient to accompli&s;h a thorough reforma|tion. Pride and vanity were virtues with them: revenge allowed, when a provocation was given and an injury received; and &s;ome very gro&s;s vices were pleaded for by many of them, as I had occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve before. But the correction, the holy Scripture is profitable for, is more entire and complete. It extends to every corruption, and is levelled again&s;t every &s;in, again&s;t the whole old man. It teaches to <HI>deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts,</HI> Tit. ii. 12.</P>
<P>Farther, it &s;trikes at the root of &s;in in the heart and affections. Never did any in&s;titution of re|ligion proceed with &s;o much purity and divine au|thority, as the Scripture does in this re&s;pect. <HI>Be|ware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,</HI> &s;ays the law of God, Deut. xv. 9. It lays re&s;traints
<PB N="314" REF="028262_0315_0FD7F7415EB4EA88">upon the inward de&s;ires, the fir&s;t motions of the heart, di&s;cerns and condemns &s;in there. Hence, according to the doctrine of our Saviour, ra&s;h an|ger is murder, and a wanton glance adultery, Matt. v. 22, 28. It purifies the fountain, and mends the principles from whence our actions flow.</P>
<P>Again, it furni&s;hes the &s;tronge&s;t motives again&s;t &s;in, oppo&s;es it with all the force of argument and per&s;ua&s;ion. It repre&s;ents, how much it is again&s;t our pre&s;ent intere&s;t, our peace and comfort, our honor, and even our profit in mo&s;t ca&s;es; and how utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with our future and eter|nal intere&s;t. <HI>He that &s;inneth again&s;t God wrongeth his own &s;oul. The wages of &s;in is death,</HI> everla&s;ting death. In &s;hort, <HI>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven</HI> in Scripture <HI>again&s;t all ungodline&s;s of men.</HI> It &s;ets a flaming &s;word, as it were, to di&s;courage &s;inners, and throws terrors and deaths in their way. No book in the world doth or can appear again&s;t &s;in with &s;o much authority as the Bible doth. Did we believe its reports and con&s;ider its threatnings in their utmo&s;t extent, view &s;in in its connection with death and hell, according to the Scripture ac|count of the matter, we &s;hould not make &s;o light a thing of it, as we are many times too apt to do: the very appearance of it would give us a &s;ort of horror. In a word, the account the Scripture gives of &s;in, of its original, nature, tendency, pre&s;ent mi|&s;eries and torments, and future puni&s;hments is a very proper means to keep us from it. Herein it is <HI>profitable for correction.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add, that the Scripture <HI>is profitable for correction,</HI> as it is attended with an inward effi|cacy and force. <HI>The word of God is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than any two-edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pi|rit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</HI> It not only
<PB N="315" REF="028262_0316_0FD7F74C85C449B0">&s;peaks again&s;t &s;in and condemns it, but ran&s;acks the heart, penetrates the con&s;cience, and ri&s;es again&s;t it with a maje&s;ty and authority that is peculiar to it&s;elf. Good men find this divine efficacy in the word. A text of Scripture will have more force to check and controul an unruly pa&s;&s;ion, than an hundred &s;mooth harrangues of human compo&s;ure. David experienced this &s;overeignty and mark of divinity in the Scriptures, and celebrates it through|out P&s;alm cxix, and in other places. And &s;ome|times it plea&s;es God to give it the like efficacy to|wards &s;inners. <HI>The weapons of our warfare,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>are not carnal, but mighty through God.</HI> The word of God di&s;covers vice and dethrones it, It has done &s;o in a thou&s;and in&s;tances. Particu|larly at the fir&s;t preaching of the go&s;pel, which made one of the fathers glory of it in this re&s;pect. Shew me a pa&s;&s;ionate man, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and with a few words of God I will render him mild as a lamb, and the like with re&s;pect to the unclean, &amp;c. Thus <HI>profitable</HI> is the Scripture for correction and refor|mation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. the only head that remains to be touched is, that it is <HI>profitable for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that is, for in&s;truction in all the parts of our duty towards God, towards our neighbor, and towards our&s;elves. It teaches us, as is &s;aid more particu|larly of the go&s;pel, <HI>to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> We have there rules of perfect holine&s;s &s;et before us, directing how to go|vern our appetites, &s;en&s;es, de&s;ires, affections, and pa&s;&s;ions; rules of temperance and cha&s;tity in thought, &s;peech, and behaviour; of meekne&s;s, hu|mility, and the like: rules of ju&s;tice towards men, in all our commerce or intercour&s;e with them. Our Saviour compri&s;es the &s;ub&s;tance of all in two maxims, that we <HI>love our neighbor as our&s;elves,</HI> and
<PB N="316" REF="028262_0317_0FD7F74E20DEDF08">that <HI>whatever</HI> we <HI>would that men &s;hould do unto</HI> us, we <HI>&s;hould do even &s;o unto them.</HI> The&s;e are enlarged and commented upon in a variety of particulars, all tending to exclude injuries, oppre&s;&s;ion, and every thing that is hurtful, and to e&s;tabli&s;h an ex|act decorum and equity in our mutual corre&s;pon|dence. And with equal beauty and per&s;ection, it pre&s;cribes to us the &s;cheme and method of conver&s;e with God. It directs us to <HI>love</HI> him <HI>with all</HI> our <HI>hearts,</HI> to <HI>fear</HI> him, to <HI>tru&s;t</HI> him, to <HI>delight</HI> in him, to <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> him, to devote our&s;elves to him, to choo&s;e him and re&s;t in him, as the only felicity and hap|pine&s;s of our &s;ouls, to make him the Alpha and O|mega, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the beginning and the end of our actions, and indeed the all in all.</P>
<P>This is the general u&s;e of the holy Scripture. It was <HI>given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable</HI> for the&s;e high and noble purpo&s;es, <HI>for doctrine, for re|proof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>A reflection or two upon what has been &s;aid &s;hall conclude this point. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. We may &s;ee hence the vanity of that plea the church of Rome advances in behalf of oral tradition. They own with us, that the Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God; but they pretend, that there are &s;everal divine doctrines, nece&s;&s;ary truths not contained in the Scripture, which the apo&s;tles delivered to the churches by word of mouth. To this we have to an&s;wer, that it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed God &s;hould indite a book, for the u&s;e of his church, and that book &s;hould be defective in any nece&s;&s;ary point. That the Scripture every where witne&s;&s;es to its own perfection. The text tells us, it <HI>is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, &amp;c. that the man of God may be perfect, tho|roughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</HI> And in the foregoing ver&s;e, it is &s;aid, that the holy <HI>Scriptures are able to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</HI> Farther, we have
<PB N="317" REF="028262_0318_0FD7F74FED03C5F0">expre&s;s caution again&s;t the&s;e unwritten traditions. Thus in the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>You &s;hall not add to the word that I command you, neither &s;hall you dimini&s;h from it.</HI> And we find the whole Bible has a &s;eal &s;et to it, in &s;hut up with this awful &s;aying, that <HI>if any man &s;hall add unto the&s;e things, God &s;hall add unto him the plagues written in this book. And if any man &s;hall take away from the words of this book, God &s;hall take away his part out of the book of life.</HI> It is an in&s;pired book, <HI>is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,</HI> and for all the purpo&s;es of religion, is able to make the man of God, the mini&s;ter, the chri&s;tian, perfect: perfect in faith, and perfect in all duties and offices. God has not left it to the caprice and humor of men to add to it, and change it at plea|&s;ure. If he had, it would be no complete rule, and would &s;oon cea&s;e to be any rule at all. I might &s;ub|join a multitude of arguments again&s;t this &s;orry pretence of the Romani&s;ts, was this a place to de|bate that matter. I &s;hall only take notice farther, that the tradition they boa&s;t of has always di&s;graced it&s;elf, and proved it&s;elf an impo&s;ture. Their mo&s;t early traditions have the mo&s;t palpable marks of fable in them. As that of Papias concerning the Millennium; that of the primitive church, which occa&s;ioned &s;o &s;candalous a divi&s;ion among them, relating to the time of keeping Ea&s;ter. Had tra|dition been any good rule, &s;urely we might have expected it would have run clear, and not been &s;o muddy at the very fountain head, as we find it was.</P>
<P>Nor has their tradition only failed them, but be|trayed them into a direct oppo&s;ition to the holy Scripture. For upon this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ock they have grafted &s;everal doctrines contrary to the in&s;pired writings, as purgatory, indulgences, their Latin &s;ervice, the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s, &amp;c. Not to &s;ay, that they have among them traditions incon&s;i&s;tent one with another. In one age they e&s;tabli&s;h doctrines, as
<PB N="318" REF="028262_0319_0FD7F7543A2E64D8">&s;acred and divine, by virtue of a pretended tradi|tion, which in another age are condemned as here&s;y and loaded with an anathema: as, the eating of things &s;trangled, and blood, the immaculate con|ception of the virgin Mary, and the like.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not enlarge on the&s;e things. You have your Bible, chri&s;tians, and there you have a perfect rule of faith and practice. Study that, and you will find it profitable for you in all re&s;pects. It will <HI>make the man of God perfect.</HI> If you neglect that, you will lo&s;e your&s;elf in the labyrinth of hu|man fictions, and neither know what to believe, nor what to practice.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is the <HI>Scripture given by in&s;piration of God, and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> let us u&s;e it for all the&s;e purpo&s;es, receive its doctrines, receive all its doctrines, acquaint your&s;elves with what it teach|es, and re&s;ign to its authority therein. This is a matter of no &s;mall importance, and will require no &s;mall indu&s;try and humility. Do not object again&s;t any of the doctrines of the Bible, becau&s;e they do not &s;eem to &s;tand upon a level with your under|&s;tanding. Whatever God teaches is true; and it is enough, &s;hould be enough to us, that he teaches it, whatever difficulties there may &s;eem to be in it. We &s;hould learn to reverence infinite wi&s;dom, and &s;ubmit our narrow faculties to the conduct thereof. And then endeavor to receive all the doctrines of Scripture. It <HI>is profitable for doctrine,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ere is no doctrine of the Scripture that we &s;hould e&s;teem unprofitable. Such a temper is profane, and in|cludes in it a &s;ort of bla&s;phemy again&s;t the divine wi&s;dom. God knows better than we do what is nece&s;&s;ary and good for us, and wherein he has con|de&s;cended to be a teacher, we &s;hould be cheerful and humble learners. Study therefore your Bible, and endeavor to be complete in all the will of God.
<PB N="319" REF="028262_0320_0FD7F755AC96D350">Whatever God &s;peaks, we &s;hould be ready to hear. All <HI>Scripture is profitable for doctrine,</HI> and it very ill becomes us to neglect the greate&s;t part of it un|der a pretence that it is not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Farther, u&s;e it <HI>for reproof.</HI> Reject every doc|trine contrary to it, and that is again&s;t what it doth reveal, and every thing that is be&s;ides and above what it doth reveal. Let it be the mea&s;ure and boundary of your faith. Endeavor to come up to it, and not go beyond it.</P>
<P>U&s;e it <HI>for correction.</HI> Mind its admonitions, and allow your&s;elves in no thoughts, de&s;ires, words or acts the Scripture &s;ets a mark upon as &s;inful or un|lawful. This is to be chri&s;tians indeed. And according to our care and exactne&s;s herein, we are more or le&s;s chri&s;tians. Hearken to it, and let it correct every &s;inful motion and di&s;order in the &s;oul, and every wry &s;tep in your cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>Once more, u&s;e it for your <HI>in&s;truction in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> As it pre&s;cribes to you in every part of your conver&s;ation, teaches you how to conduct your&s;elves in your whole conver&s;e in the world. To which purpo&s;e, it will be of exceeding advan|tage to you, if you collected and wrote down the principal rules that refer thereto both under this and the former head. For in&s;tance, the Scripture rules for correcting the iniquity of our thoughts, de|&s;ires affections and actions, and the rules for the conduct of all the&s;e, write down the mo&s;t pertinent Scriptures that refer thereto. Frequently peru&s;e them, commit them to your memories. Set them before you as matter of daily duty. Look upon it as your great bu&s;ine&s;s to practice according to the&s;e rules. Endeavor to be good proficients herein. And in proportion to your attainments in this mat|ter, &s;o is your &s;tature in religion. O that I could prevail with you to do this. Nothing in the world would be more your intere&s;t. And indeed without
<PB N="320" REF="028262_0321_0FD7F7623B68C938">&s;ome attention and care this way, you lo&s;e the main advantage of the Bible; you only profe&s;s religion in a general confu&s;ed manner; all you hear, and all you read in the Scripture will turn to little ac|count. Take this method, chri&s;tians. God has given you a book full of glorious excellencies. U&s;e it for its proper end. And con&s;ider for your encouragement, that if you believe it, &s;tudy it, live it, it will be in every re&s;pect profitable to you: it will be <HI>a light to your feel, and a lamp to your paths;</HI> will &s;upport you under your difficulties, fortify you again&s;t temptations, guide you in your duties, and carry you &s;afe to heaven. Therefore make the holy, in&s;pired Scripture your rule, live under its conduct and influence, and you &s;hall die with its comforts.</P>
<P N="2">II. I come now to con&s;ider the u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;everal parts of Scripture. It is <HI>all profitable,</HI> &s;ays the text, every book and part of the Bible has its u&s;e, and is of &s;ervice to the church. What its u&s;e|fulne&s;s is, I am now to enquire. The &s;ubject is copious, and of no &s;mall importance; and yet I mu&s;t very much pa&s;s it over. Though I own it was one thing I had principally in view in the choice of my text. If nothing prevent, I may en|deavor the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e that de&s;ire it ano|ther way, and upon other occa&s;ions. What I have before me, is, to &s;hew the u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;everal parts of the Bible. Concerning which I &s;hall, fir&s;t premi&s;e a few things, and then &s;peak to the &s;ubject more directly in another di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only premi&s;e a few things con|cerning this matter. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That we have great rea&s;on to conclude that all Scripture is profitable and u&s;eful, in that it is given by in&s;piration of God. Since he is the au|thor of it, we may &s;uppo&s;e it is u&s;eful and perti|nent, even though there were &s;ome parts and pa&s;&s;a|ges
<PB N="321" REF="028262_0322_0FD7F762AE47CB28">of it that we could not under&s;tand. A wi&s;e man will not write a book of no u&s;e and value; much le&s;s, the only wi&s;e God. We find the pro|phet celebrating God in his common providence, as in&s;tructing the hu&s;bandman in the management of his affairs, and inferring, that there mu&s;t be wi&s;|dom in the management &s;ince it was from God. <HI>This cometh forth from the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who is won|derful in council, and excellent in working.</HI> What cometh forth from God, who is wonderful in coun|cil, and excellent in working, cannot be worthle&s;s and in&s;ignificant. And thus doth the Scripture, all Scripture, every part of it. And yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. Though all Scripture is profitable, it is not alike &s;o, nor all u&s;eful for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. Some part of Scripture was written for one, other parts for a different end. It is not all u&s;eful for one and the &s;ame end: but all excellent and u&s;eful for its proper end. As in the work of creation God pro|nounced all things good, very good: not that eve|ry creature or &s;pecies of creatures have the &s;ame degree of excellency, or an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e: but all are good in their place, and an&s;wer the par|ticular end God de&s;igned them to &s;erve. There is a mighty difference between a man and a brute, a &s;eraph or an in&s;ect; and yet both are good. So it is with re&s;pect to the holy Scripture, it is all di|vine, excellent, and good; but it is not all alike important and excellent, nor doth every part of it afford the like in&s;truction. I cannot therefore un|der&s;tand the humor of &s;ome devout men, that when they have read a chapter of the Bible, think them|&s;elves obliged to enquire what they can find of Chri&s;t there. We have a great deal of Chri&s;t in the Bible, but not in every chapter of it. And we &s;hould not look for him where he is not to be found. The Scripture is u&s;eful for many purpo&s;es. Some parts for one, &s;ome for another purpo&s;e. And we
<PB N="322" REF="028262_0323_0FD7F76498389F60">then make the true&s;t and be&s;t u&s;e of it when we re|fer every part to its proper purpo&s;e, what God in|tended in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let me ob&s;erve, that the Bible was not deli|vered at once, as a complete &s;y&s;tem of divinity, and body of religion, but contains various, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revelations, gradually made, as &s;eemed good to in|finite wi&s;dom. <HI>God, who at &s;undry times, and in di|ver&s;e manners, &s;pake to the fathers by the prophets,</HI> at la&s;t <HI>&s;pake to us by his Son.</HI></P>
<P>Was I to illu&s;trate this, I &s;hould give you a &s;hort view of the different di&s;pen&s;ations of religion, the different &s;tates of revelation in the &s;everal ages and periods thereof; as, under Adam, Noah, Abra|ham, Mo&s;es, and the Son of God incarnate. Adam had a revelation from God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h before his fall and after, a plan of religion delivered to him, upon which his intercour&s;e and acceptance with God was founded. This was continued among the patri|archs with enlargements at &s;everal times; as under Noah and Abraham. And under Mo&s;es a new pe|culiar di&s;pen&s;ation, a theocracy was introduced; not to &s;et a&s;ide any former revelations, laws, and methods of religion; but to &s;erve the wi&s;e de&s;ign of providence at that time, and to prepare for a fuller and more glorious &s;tate of religion under Chri&s;t. The&s;e &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations make up the Bible, and the &s;urvey of them would &s;hew you the progre&s;s of divine revelation, the u&s;efulne&s;s thereof, and, I reckon, would direct to the be&s;t method of explaining it. But this is what I mu&s;t not now pre|tend to.</P>
<P N="4">4. Every revelation God made to the world was de&s;igned for the u&s;e of the church, not only in the age when it was given, but in all future ages. The apo&s;tle tells us, that the <HI>things which happened</HI> to the <HI>Jews</HI> were <HI>written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> Indeed the church of
<PB N="323" REF="028262_0324_0FD7F7679D9F38B0">God, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is but one body, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at different times, and in different forms. Fir&s;t in its infancy, then in a more improved &s;tate, till it was brought to a &s;tate of maturity under the go&s;pel, and at la&s;t &s;hall be brought to a &s;tate of full per|fection in heaven. Now the revelation vouch&s;afed to the church, at any time, was for the &s;ervice of the whole body at all times. When any new reve|lation was given forth, it did not make void any thing that went before, but &s;uppo&s;ed it was built upon it, and was &s;upplemental to it, except in the ca&s;e of the go&s;pels vacating the typical and tem|porary di&s;pen&s;ation of Mo&s;es. And con&s;equently tho&s;e that live under the la&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation of reli|gion, when revelation is fini&s;hed and compleated are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;pecial advantages, which is our ca&s;e that enjoy the go&s;pel. We have the be|nefit of all foregoing revelations, the light, in&s;truc|tion, admonition, and examples of former ages, the whole trea&s;ure of the holy in&s;pired Scripture, all the glories and excellencies of the Bible are com|mitted to us and lodged in our hands. Let us be thankful for our privileges, and endeavor to im|prove them. If every part of Scripture be pro|fitable and u&s;eful, to be &s;ure the entire Scripture mu&s;t be &s;o. But I mu&s;t leave what remains on this &s;ubject to another opportunity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I PROCEED now to enquire into the particular u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;everal parts of Scripture. It cannot be expected, that I &s;hould examine the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of every book. That would require a vo|lume rather than a &s;ermon. Nor can I go through the &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations of religion and di&s;tinct pe|riods of revelation, and give an account of tho&s;e parts of the Bible that fall under each. How much advantages &s;oever there might be in &s;uch a method, I mu&s;t here decline it. All I can do, is to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the Bible, as divided into the &s;everal &s;ubjects of it. And I &s;hall con&s;ider it under the following heads, as containing hi&s;tories, prophecies, ceremonies, matters of morality, and doctrines.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider the hi&s;torical part of the Bi|ble. This is highly u&s;eful to the church. A great deal of it you know is wrote by way of hi&s;tory, and there is &s;carce any hi&s;tory in the Scripture but what affords abundance of divine in&s;truction. Re|flect a little on the fir&s;t book in the Bible, Gene&s;is. A few chapters of that &s;acred hi&s;tory are of greater
<PB N="326" REF="028262_0326_0FD7F7691DA6D5E8">u&s;e to the church than any large volumes of com|mon writers. I will only take notice of three or four things of which we have an account in this book, and, I may add, in no other book in the world, but what borrows from it. As</P>
<P N="1">1. The creation of the world. The philo&s;o|phers, that wanted the conduct of revelation, were utterly at a lo&s;s and in confu&s;ion about this matter, and run into wild and ab&s;urd hypothe&s;es, as I had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve before. Some of the be&s;t of them, that believed and acknowledged one God, &s;upreme and eternal, and that he was infinitely good, thought his goodne&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily communicate it&s;elf, and thereupon concluded it did &s;o from eter|nity, and con&s;equently that the world mu&s;t be eter|nal. Now this hi&s;tory removes all &s;cruples here, and &s;atisfies all que&s;tions in a few words, tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the world was made, made in time, and made by God, by a free, and yet powerful act of his will. <HI>Let there be,</HI> &s;aith God, <HI>and there was.</HI> His <HI>fiat</HI> or &s;o|vereign word brought all things into being. This clears all difficulties, and at the &s;ame time has &s;uch a grandeur and maje&s;ty in it, that Longinus allows it to be an in&s;tance of the true &s;ublime. <HI>In the be|ginning God created the heaven and the earth, and God &s;aid, let there be light, and there was light. Let there be a firmament, &amp;c. and it was &s;o.</HI> With how much maje&s;ty is this &s;poken, and how fit to convey to the mind an idea of God's greatne&s;s, his infinite great|ne&s;s. <HI>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the ho&s;ts thereof by the breath of his mouth.</HI> How glorious a being is the author of this amazing work? how ju&s;tly may we &s;ay of him as Job does, <HI>I know that thou can&s;t do every thing.</HI></P>
<P>We have here al&s;o an account of the degeneracy of the human nature, that lap&s;e or fall of mankind: a point about which all the philo&s;ophers were puz|zled and nonplu&s;ed. They found in them&s;elves, and
<PB N="327" REF="028262_0327_0FD7F76EF5AC3818">ob&s;erved in the world, a &s;trange di&s;order in the hu|man mind, that the pa&s;&s;ions and affections were be|come head&s;trong and impetuous, and that rea&s;on was not &s;trong enough to curb and ma&s;ter them. And hence &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t of them inferred, that rea&s;on had been &s;ome how weakened and hurt, and thereby lo&s;t the dominion they &s;uppo&s;ed it origi|nally had; though how to account for it they knew not. But this the Scripture hi&s;tory clears up. It tells us that man fell, and how he came to fall. In which it repre&s;ents two things among others that &s;ugge&s;t matter of admiration and caution to us, viz. The danger of pride and &s;en&s;uality, the devil mak|ing u&s;e of the body of a &s;eraph, or bright &s;hining &s;er|pent, in&s;inuated to the woman, that if they eat they &s;hould be advanced to an higher &s;tation, be as God in wi&s;dom and independency, and thus flattered their ambition and took with them, and then the fruit appeared plea&s;ant to the eye, as well as de&s;ira|ble to make wi&s;e; both their rational and &s;en&s;itive appetites were flattered at once, and this hurried them into the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and occa&s;ioned their fall. See here the danger of pride, and of plea&s;ing the &s;en&s;es. It undid man in paradi&s;e, man in inno|cency, and continues the great danger of mankind to this day. Another thing &s;ugge&s;ted in this hi&s;to|ry of the fall is, the &s;hame and cowardi&s;e con&s;e|quent upon &s;in. No &s;ooner had Adam &s;inned, but he hid him&s;elf among the trees of the garden. Be|fore the pre&s;ence of God was his life and his joy, but now he runs away from it. <HI>I heard thy voice,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and hid my&s;elf, for I was afraid becau&s;e I was naked.</HI> Sin had &s;tripped him of his innocency and his ornaments, and now the pre&s;ence and voice of his maker fills him with terror. And this is the natural fruit of &s;in. However it appears during the temptation, when the plea&s;ure is over and the ma&s;k is thrown off, it i&s;&s;ues in bitterne&s;s, &s;hame and
<PB N="328" REF="028262_0328_0FD7F770E6D4E330">horror. It is &s;aid of our fir&s;t parents, that <HI>the eyes of them both were opened and they &s;aw that they were naked,</HI> they &s;aw their guilt and were filled with con|fu&s;ion upon it. And thus it &s;till is with &s;inners when con&s;cience is awakened.</P>
<P>I might take notice of the in&s;titution of marriage between one man and one woman, in oppo&s;ition to polygamy. That practice which generally obtain|ed in the world, and is attended with &s;o much mi&s;|chief, &s;tands here condemned by the original ap|pointment of God. And of the in&s;titution of the &s;abbath, or a &s;eventh day of &s;acred re&s;t and religi|on, after &s;ix days of labor. This was &s;et apart by the example, benediction, and command of God immediately upon fini&s;hing the creation. It was in&s;tituted before the ceremonial law was in being, and con&s;equently, is of a moral nature, and of per|petual obligation.</P>
<P>I might add the original of the &s;oul. It was not created with the body, and out of the du&s;t, as the body was, but created immediately by God, <HI>He breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living &s;oul.</HI> Plainly intimating, that it is di&s;tinct from the body, and con&s;equently can &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out it.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e are points of &s;uch high importance, that the little order and religion there is among mankind very much depends on them; and they are wholly owing to the hi&s;tory of the Bible. The three fir&s;t chapters of it give more &s;atisfaction in the&s;e, and the like great principles and doctrines of religion, than all the philo&s;ophers in the world, that are de&s;titute of Scripture light.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things, not only as an argument of the great worth and u&s;efulne&s;s of the Scripture; but with de&s;ign they may recommend and endear the Bible to you. Read the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third of Gene&s;is, and there you may learn, what you may
<PB N="329" REF="028262_0329_0FD7F77C27129FE0">travel the world round in que&s;t of, and never learn unle&s;s you find a Bible, or conver&s;e with tho&s;e that have lighted their lamps at this torch.</P>
<P>And how valuable an hint is that, Gen. iii. 15. concerning the promi&s;ed &s;eed. When God was proceeding again&s;t the &s;everal criminals, in the mid&s;t of that more awful &s;cene he di&s;covers the purpo&s;es of his grace, <HI>The &s;eed of the woman,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</HI> The purport of which is, that an eminent and extraordinary per&s;on, who &s;hould be the &s;eed of the woman alone, &s;hould ap|pear in the world, de&s;troy Satan's kingdom, re&s;cue and deliver fallen man. This the apo&s;tle four thou&s;and years after refers to and owns the ac|compli&s;hment of; <HI>When the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</HI> A glorious &s;entence! of more con&s;equence to man|kind than all the victories and triumphs recorded by the Greek and Roman hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>I might take notice of the univer&s;al deluge, the de&s;truction of Sodom and Gomorrha, with many particulars relating to the patriarchs and their re|ligion, in which we have not only &s;everal wonder|ful and important events de&s;cribed, with a certainty and clearne&s;s, that in vain we &s;eek for in other hi&s;|tories; but the divine providence &s;et forth in the government of the world, the divine attributes di&s;|played, his knowledge, wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, holine&s;s, and hatred of &s;in manife&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as is mo&s;t fit to &s;trike the minds of men and beget in them a fear and reverence of God, and lay the foundation of divine wor&s;hip and religion.</P>
<P>You &s;ee I can only give you a ta&s;te of things, and of the great u&s;efulne&s;s of the Scripture under this head. Should I pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, even in this &s;uperficial manner, it would require many &s;ermons.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="028262_0330_0FD7F77E30162A58">
I will therefore only ob&s;erve farther, that be|&s;ides the in&s;truction the &s;acred hi&s;tory affords from the matter of it, its &s;everal narratives are generally &s;o many confirmations of its predictions and pro|phecies. The hi&s;tory of Abraham and his po&s;terity, for in&s;tance, their &s;ojourning in Egypt, their deli|verance from thence, their &s;ettling in Go&s;hen, their apo&s;tacies, captivities, and re&s;toration afterwards, are the fulfilling of the promi&s;e made to Abraham, of the prophecies uttered by Jacob when he was leaving the world, and the predictions of Mo&s;es. So that this part of the Bible, which indeed is a con&s;iderable part of the Old Te&s;tament, is exceed|ing u&s;eful to the church; it &s;hews the divine pro|vidence governing the world in a &s;overeign man|ner, &s;hews the divine knowledge in all events, and the truth of all his promi&s;es, and confirms our faith in the belief of the Scripture.</P>
<P>As to the New Te&s;tament hi&s;tory, it is full of glorious events; your own knowledge will furni&s;h you with the particulars, and a little reflection con|vince you of the u&s;efulne&s;s of them. It relates the incarnation, life, miracles, &s;ufferings, crucifixion, re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of the Son of God; the pouring out of the &s;pirit, the mini&s;try of the apo&s;|tles, and the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s that attended it, and herein lays the foundation of the chri&s;tian faith and religion, &s;trictly &s;uch, and at the &s;ame time con|firms and e&s;tabli&s;hes a great part of the Old Te&s;|tament.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not enlarge, you &s;ee by the&s;e hints, that the hi&s;tory of Scripture is profitable. Was it not be&s;ides my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I might &s;hew it was <HI>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> But I rather choo&s;e to take notice of its u&s;efulne&s;s more in ge|neral.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the hi&s;torical, &s;o the prophetical part of
<PB N="331" REF="028262_0331_0FD7F7809E8DFDB0">the Bible is profitable and u&s;eful. You mu&s;t not expect, and I dare &s;ay, do not de&s;ire, I &s;hould make a collection of the prophecies, and go through every one of them, to &s;hew their meaning and u&s;e|fulne&s;s But as you have a good deal of the Bible in this &s;train, it cannot be improper, I am &s;ure not impertinent to the &s;ubject, to touch upon the gene|ral u&s;es of the prophecies.</P>
<P>And it may be affirmed of them, as is &s;aid of all Scripture in the text, that they are <HI>profitable for doc|trine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The prophets though they in&s;i&s;ted much upon predictions, donouncing judgments, foretelling deliverances, &s;alvations and the like; yet they did not confine them&s;elves to the&s;e &s;ub|jects. They were a &s;ort of divine and extraordinary preachers to the people; one de&s;ign of who&s;e mi|ni&s;try was to pre&s;erve a &s;en&s;e of providence and religion among them; accordingly, we find their &s;ermons full of in&s;truction, admonition and reproof.</P>
<P>They give us noble ideas of God and provi|dence, and call upon tho&s;e to whom they were &s;ent, to con&s;ider their ways, to repent and reform. The Jews had a large body of ceremonial laws, in which they were very much employed, and we find they were apt wholly to place their religion therein. This the prophets take notice of, and frequently cen&s;ure, calling them to mind the weightier matters of the moral law, ju&s;tice, mercy, and the love of God, letting them know all their ritual &s;ervices would &s;ignify nothing, whil&s;t they neglected the great moral duties of religion. We have a multi|tude of in&s;tances to this purpo&s;e in the di&s;cour&s;es of the prophets; particularly, I&s;a. xiii. 14. <HI>Bring no more vain oblations,</HI> &s;aith he, in the name of God, <HI>incen&s;e is an abomination to me, the new moons and &s;abbaths, the calling of a&s;&s;emblies I cannot away with:
<PB N="332" REF="028262_0332_0FD7F780B6E8DAB0">it is iniquity even the &s;olemn meeting; your new moons and your appointed fea&s;ts my &s;oul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.</HI> He adds, <HI>ver.</HI> 16. <HI>Wa&s;h you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well, &s;eek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, judge the fatherle&s;s, plead for the widow.</HI></P>
<P>And in the like &s;train many of their di&s;cour&s;es run. Their office, in &s;hort, was to guard and re|form religion, to teach ju&s;t notions of God and providence, and to inculcate the important duties of the moral law. And for this purpo&s;e their writ|ings are of la&s;ting and con&s;tant u&s;e. The &s;ermons of the prophets concern us, as well as the people to whom they were immediately &s;ent, and we &s;hall find no &s;mall advantage in a diligent peru&s;al of them. Here we meet with the mo&s;t lively repre&s;entations of God in his nature, attributes, providence, and government. What an awful de&s;cription is that of the Supreme Being, I&s;a. xl. 12, 15, 16. <HI>Who hath mea&s;ured the waters in the hollow of his hand? meted out the heaven with the &s;pan, comprehended the du&s;t of the earth in a mea&s;ure, weighed the mountains in &s;cales, and the hills in a balance? behold the na|tions are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance: behold, he taketh up the I&s;les as a very little thing. Lebanon it&s;elf is not &s;uf|ficient to burn, nor the bea&s;ts thereof &s;ufficient for a burnt offering. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him as le&s;s than nothing and vanity.</HI> And how maje&s;tic and yet comfortable is that repre&s;entation of him, I&s;a. lvii. 15. <HI>Thus &s;aith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, who&s;e name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place; with him al&s;o, that is of a contrite and humble &s;pirit, to re|vive the &s;pirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</HI></P>
<P>And as we are furni&s;hed with &s;uitable apprehen|&s;ions
<PB N="333" REF="028262_0333_0FD7F781F2720C18">of God, &s;o we are in&s;tructed in our duty in an admirable manner; our duty towards God, our neighbor, and our&s;elves. Micha &s;ums up all in a few words, chap. vi. 8. <HI>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> The&s;e great branches of our religion are here enlarged upon, the contrary &s;ins pointed out in a way that is very proper to awe the con&s;ciences and &s;trike the pa&s;&s;ions. Glo|rious is the advantage of the prophetic writings in this re&s;pect. Nor, it may be, can the man of God, the believer, the chri&s;tian be better furni&s;hed any where for every good work than from hence. This part of Scripture is profitable, and it is well worth our while to &s;tudy it diligently, to acquaint our&s;elves with the doctrine, the language, &s;tyle and phra&s;e of the prophets, hereby our minds will be enriched with excellent divine notions, armed a|gain&s;t &s;in, and not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted in devotion.</P>
<P>Again, the prophetic part of Scripture, as con|&s;i&s;ting in predictions, is of mighty u&s;e, particularly, as it manife&s;ts the infinite knowledge of God, and his &s;overeign providence over the world. We find there a multitude of &s;urpri&s;ing events at a va&s;t di&s;tance foretold, which accordingly took place in the very time and manner &s;ignified in the prophecy. Now this &s;hews, that all things, even future, as well as pre&s;ent <HI>are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do;</HI> that known unto the Lord are all his works from the beginning unto the end; that his eyes run to and fro throughout the earth, conducting with a &s;teady &s;overeign hand all things to &s;uch i&s;&s;ues, as he has fore&s;een and ap|pointed. With what &s;overeignty, how becoming is that &s;poken, I&s;a. xlvi. 9, 10. <HI>I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, &s;aying my council &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my
<PB N="334" REF="028262_0334_0FD7F788E31A0DB0">plea&s;ure.</HI> And when we &s;ee this done in the ac|compli&s;hment of numerous prophecies, it &s;erves to give us high and exalted thoughts of the Deity, a reverence of his providence, and &s;hould teach us to commit all affairs with faith, dependance and full re&s;ignation into his hands, the affair of the church, and our own particular affairs.</P>
<P>Farther, the prophetic part of Scripture is u&s;eful as it affords a &s;trong argument again&s;t &s;in, and unto obedience. Some of the prophecies are declara|tions of God's free and gracious purpo&s;es towards his people in this or that event; many of them de|nunciations of judgments again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; or a&s;&s;urances of deliverance and &s;alvation to the peni|tent or obedient. Now, if we con&s;ider the&s;e pro|phecies aright, con&s;ider the de&s;ign of them and their accompli&s;hment, we cannot but look upon them as &s;o many &s;tanding te&s;timonies again&s;t &s;in; of the evil and danger of it, of the good of obedience, and the like. He has de&s;troyed kingdoms, families, per&s;ons, for their iniquities, he has publi&s;hed his purpo&s;e before hand, and at la&s;t accompli&s;hed it in terrible vengeance. Stand in awe, O my &s;oul, and &s;in not, &s;ays the believer. This u&s;e we &s;hould make of the prophecies of Scripture, and &s;hall make of them, if we read them with attention, under&s;tanding and faith.</P>
<P>I might add. though I cannot &s;tay to enlarge upon it, that the prophecies were to tho&s;e that fir&s;t received them, in&s;urances of future events. They brought di&s;tant things as it were before their eyes, and into pre&s;ent view. And con&s;equently, were a trial and exerci&s;e of their faith, their hope and tru&s;t, and a direction in many particulars of duty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the prophecies accompli&s;hed, and &s;o viewed by the church in after-ages, are a glorious confirmation of faith. They &s;hew us not only that the Lord is God, <HI>Elohim,</HI> governor of the world,
<PB N="335" REF="028262_0335_0FD7F7892318B208">that he rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; but they &s;hew us al&s;o the truth of his word, the in&s;piration and authority of tho&s;e that were employed to deliver it. We can|not have a greater evidence of the divine commi&s;|&s;ion of the penmen of Scripture than the &s;pirit of prophecy that attended them; e&s;pecially when we &s;ee their predictions come to pa&s;s. No man could &s;ay and declare &s;uch things &s;o long before hand, un|le&s;s God was with him. So that when we are read|ing the prophecies we are reading the credentials of tho&s;e divine mini&s;ters from whom we receive our religion, who have &s;poken to us by the word of the Lord, and in the name of the Lord. On which account, as well as others, we &s;hould exceedingly value them, and delight in them.</P>
<P>Once more, the prophecies are highly u&s;eful as they are a pledge and earne&s;t of the accompli&s;hment of &s;uch events as are yet future and waited for. <HI>There failed not ought of any good thing,</HI> &s;ays Jo&s;hua, <HI>which the Lord had &s;poken to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, all came to pa&s;s.</HI> Now when we &s;ee all come to pa&s;s which God hath &s;poken, in &s;o many in&s;tances here|tofore, we may re&s;t &s;ecure that all which yet re|mains to be fulfilled, &s;hall come to pa&s;s al&s;o. God &s;peaks of our deliverance by Chri&s;t four thou&s;and years before the event, and this wonderful thing was accordingly made good. He has &s;poken of the revolutions of kingdoms and nations, their ri&s;e and fall long before they were in the world, and all has come to pa&s;s. Hence our faith may argue and conclude, even with a fort of triumph, that all God's promi&s;es and predictions in behalf of his church, &s;hall have their accompli&s;hment in the time and manner he has appointed. For in&s;tance, anti|chri&s;t &s;hall be de&s;troyed, all rule, authority, and power be put down under the feet of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t's little flock &s;hall be pre&s;erved
<PB N="336" REF="028262_0336_0FD7F78A283292B8">receive a kingdom; the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incor|ruptible, and the living &s;aints changed. This a chri&s;tian may look for, and conclude upon with as much a&s;&s;urance as if he had heard the voice of the archangel, the trump of God, and &s;aw the Lord Je|&s;us de&s;cend from heaven in his Schekina and glory. So many wonderful things foretold in Scripture have been already wonderfully accompli&s;hed, that we cannot rea&s;onably que&s;tion any thing that re|mains to be accompli&s;hed. No, heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but not one iota of the divine word &s;hall fail. O be thankful for every part of Scripture, particularly for the prophetic part of it, and when you peru&s;e the&s;e glorious te&s;timonies of God's wi&s;dom, knowledge, power and providence, endeavour to make a u&s;eful improvement thereof: celebrating and adoring God in what is pa&s;t, de|pending upon him for what is future; remember|ing that of the apo&s;tle, <HI>What&s;oever things were writ|ten aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The ceremonial or ritual part of the Bible, is of u&s;e to the church. The Old Te&s;tament religion was much concerned in the&s;e things, in &s;acrifices, wa&s;hings, meats, drinks, the ob&s;ervation of days, &amp;c. and &s;o large a portion of the Bible is employed about them, that it cannot but be worth while for a man that hath a reverence for it, to enquire into the meaning of &s;uch in&s;titutions, <HI>All Scripture is profitable,</HI> and &s;urely this. Otherwi&s;e it had not been given <HI>by in&s;piration of God.</HI> What the u&s;e and profit of it is, I am briefly to repre&s;ent. You cannot expect I &s;hould de&s;cend to particulars, and con&s;ider the &s;everal rites of the Levitical law. All that comes within the compa&s;s of my de&s;ign, is, to offer a few general remarks upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The ceremonial or ritual part of Scripture, was
<PB N="337" REF="028262_0337_0FD7F79885F11A58">of u&s;e to the church, when the particulars thereof were in force, as they were the matter of their obe|dience; tokens of God's &s;overeignty and domini|on over them, and expre&s;&s;ions of their &s;ubjection. Though neither we, nor they that received the ce|remonial &s;ervices, &s;hould be able to account for all of them, the will and appointment of God was rea|&s;on enough to determine the obedience of tho&s;e that were enjoined to ob&s;erve them. The church was then in its non-age and infancy. And as pa|rents &s;ometimes pre&s;cribe to their children &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ervices, the de&s;ign and end of which they do not under&s;tand, why might not God deal thus with his people at that time: and as the compliance of children in this ca&s;e is acceptable and plea&s;ing, and of u&s;e to train them up to &s;ubjection, &s;o, no que&s;ti|on, it was in the&s;e in&s;titutions of religion. Though the Jews knew not what God intended by &s;ome of the ordinances e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, they knew they were the laws and pre&s;criptions of their &s;ove|reign and wi&s;e creator and governor, and con&s;e|quently that their obedience would be acceptable to him and profitable to them&s;elves. And if we con&s;ider the ceremonial law in this view, it is &s;till u&s;eful even to us, as it affords us an important ad|monition and in&s;truction, viz. to be &s;ubject to the will of God in all things, even when we do not clearly apprehend his particular de&s;ign therein. There was a great deal of this in Abraham's &s;aith and obedience; for which he is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, and mentioned with &s;o much honor in the Scrip|tures, and in the church of God to this day. <HI>Take now thy &s;on,</HI> &s;ays God to him, <HI>thy only &s;on, I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering, upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</HI> Strange! what can this mean? was he not the &s;on of his hopes? the root of that glorious &s;eed in whom all
<PB N="338" REF="028262_0338_0FD7F7988A5DA020"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed? and mu&s;t he now be cut off by the hands of his own fa|ther? what then would become of the promi&s;e? and yet Abraham makes no objection, but addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to this difficult amazing duty; and for this he had an honor put upon him, by which he has been di&s;tingui&s;hed ever &s;ince. God has a right to command, and it is our place to obey. And though his laws carry with them generally &s;ufficient evi|dence of their rea&s;onablene&s;s, and we are convinced of their benificial, comfortable tendency; yet when it is otherwi&s;e, as it might be often in the ca&s;e of the Jews, his will is rea&s;on enough. And indeed the more we are di&s;po&s;ed even to an implicit &s;ub|jection to the will of God, the more excellency there is in our faith and obedience. And when we find a people &s;o long trained up in &s;uch a cour&s;e of obedience, it &s;hould teach us to bow our under|&s;tandings and wills to the divine revelation and will, even when we have not a clear under&s;tanding of the intention of the lawgiver.</P>
<P>Again, the ceremonies and ritual &s;ervices of the law were u&s;eful to the church, as they were a means of ab&s;olution, and of obtaining pardon of &s;in. There were indeed &s;ome exceptions; pre&s;umptu|ous &s;inners had not the indulgence of a &s;acrifice, were not allowed to bring their offerings, but were to be cut off. Nor could the blood of bulls and goats take away &s;in, purge the con&s;cience, and make the comers thereunto perfect. They were not in them&s;elves of &s;ufficient efficacy for this pur|po&s;e. But, as they were of divine appointment, and had a re&s;pect to the atonement of the Son of God, they were tokens and a&s;&s;urances of God's pardon|ing mercy and grace to them, and to the penitent and &s;incere available, no doubt, for their real ab|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Farther, they were u&s;eful as types of the Me&s;&s;iah;
<PB N="339" REF="028262_0339_0FD7F79A26F46598">as &s;o many &s;en&s;ible a&s;&s;urances of the accompli&s;h|ment of the promi&s;es concerning redemption by Chri&s;t; <HI>The feed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;er|pent's head.</HI> This was the foundation of all that friendly intercour&s;e between God and man after the apo&s;tacy. Now every &s;acrifice they brought and flew, was a &s;ort of a repre&s;entation of this great and glorious event. And hence, it may be, he is called the <HI>Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world.</HI> He died, as it were, in a figure, and hung upon the cro&s;s as often as the &s;acrifice died and was laid upon the altar. So that here was a glori|ous in&s;titution to exhibit Chri&s;t. And when we look back upon the&s;e ancient records, as we &s;ee the venerable monuments of divine wi&s;dom; &s;o com|paring them with the event, we have our faith not a little confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed. Chri&s;t was to come, to die, to ju&s;tify us by his blood. The Jews had the earne&s;t of this in their hands, in their &s;a|crifices and other &s;ervices: and many hundred years after we have the thing it&s;elf; have &s;een the &s;alvation of God. The &s;ame rites and &s;hadows that directed their faith to Chri&s;t, confirm our faith in him.</P>
<P>And then, the&s;e rites and ceremonies were de|&s;igned as a di&s;tinction of that nation, to which they were given, from the re&s;t of the world. God cho&s;e Abraham, and called him from among idolators to be the head of a peculiar people. His family was to be the &s;eat of God's wor&s;hip in a &s;pecial manner: of them the Me&s;&s;iah was to be born, and that his birth and de&s;cent might certainly be known, it plea&s;|ed God to inclo&s;e this family and people, and by peculiar laws and rites to divide between them and the re&s;t of mankind. They were not to intermix with the world about them, intermarry with other nations, wor&s;hip, of freely conver&s;e with them.
<PB N="340" REF="028262_0340_0FD7F79BC9E16F28">And to keep up this di&s;tinction, the law of ceremo|nies was <HI>a wall of partition,</HI> as the apo&s;tle calls it, Ephe&s;. ii. 14. which was broken down when Chri&s;t came, the end, one end, of the inclo&s;ure being at|tained. So that whil&s;t we peru&s;e this part of Scrip|ture, we may entertain our&s;elves with the contem|plation of this great de&s;ign of divine wi&s;dom and grace towards the church. God &s;et apart that peo|ple and &s;et a mark upon them from whom the re|deemer was to de&s;cend. He was to be the &s;on of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the family of David; and thus the Scripture a&s;&s;ure us he was. <HI>It is evident,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>our Lord &s;prung out of Judah.</HI> It was a matter of the la&s;t importance to know the Me&s;&s;iah when he appeared, that this was he that was to come, and that we mu&s;t not look for another. Now that this might be manife&s;t to the church, God thus &s;eparated the family and nation from whence he &s;prung.</P>
<P>Again, this part of Scripture revelation is u&s;eful, as it tends to give us high notions and an augu&s;t idea of Chri&s;t and the chri&s;tian religion. All this glorious apparatus, and the laws and &s;ervices of that di&s;pen&s;ation, which were the &s;tudy and employment of the church for &s;o many hundred years, were de|&s;igned to introduce the go&s;pel &s;tate. And with what &s;olemnity do they introduce it! the incarna|tion of Chri&s;t, his &s;acrifice, and our redemption by him, are among the chief of the works of God; the greate&s;t my&s;teries of his grace. And methinks, when it is con&s;idered that the glory of the Jewi&s;h temple, and all the &s;ervices thereof, all the ceremo|nies and rites of a law revealed from heaven, re|ferred to this, and were to i&s;&s;ue and terminate in it; and indeed were contrived on purpo&s;e to give no|tice of the go&s;pel, to proclaim Chri&s;t, and to u&s;her him into the world; when we con&s;ider this, and &s;e|riou&s;ly reflect upon the providence of God therein,
<PB N="341" REF="028262_0341_0FD7F79D4B2D0DB0">we cannot but infer the glory of the go&s;pel &s;tate. Let us make this u&s;e of that part of the Bible, that to many appears u&s;ele&s;s. We may judge of a building in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the greatne&s;s of the &s;caffolding. Certainly &s;uch a va&s;t preparation was never de&s;igned to introduce a thing of little mo|ment.</P>
<P>I add, this part of revelation and &s;tate of religion is of u&s;e, as it may admini&s;ter cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s to us, that we are under an higher and more excel|lent di&s;pen&s;ation. The apo&s;tle often &s;peaks of the Jewi&s;h law in terms of great diminution. He calls the ceremonies thereof, the <HI>elements of this world, beggarly elements,</HI> &s;peaks of the law as <HI>a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t;</HI> as in&s;ufficient; <HI>a &s;hadow of good things to come,</HI> and repre&s;ents the &s;ervices and laborious performances of it, as a yoke, that neither the Jews of that age, nor their <HI>fathers were able to bear.</HI> Now among other advantages we have by the levitical law, this is one, the exciting our thank|fulne&s;s for the more manly, &s;piritual, rational reli|gion of the go&s;pel. Not but that there was an ex|cellency in their religion, and a reverence due to it, as it was the appointment of God. No doubt, &s;erious upright per&s;ons enjoyed acceptance with God, and intercour&s;e with him in it. But that glo|ry was nothing, compared with the glory of the go&s;pel which excells. Now when we find in what low &s;ervices, comparitively, their religion con&s;i&s;ted, we &s;hould rejoice and be thankful that we are cal|led to more noble and divine work.</P>
<P>Once more, the ceremonies and rites of Mo&s;es were u&s;eful to the church at that time, and are &s;till u&s;eful to us, as they contain many moral documents and in&s;tructions. I might go through a great num|ber of particulars, and at large illu&s;trate this; but can only him at things in a general way. Circum|ci&s;ion refers to the inward mortification of &s;in, and
<PB N="342" REF="028262_0342_0FD7F79E6369EEE8">was de&s;igned to teach the nece&s;&s;ity of it. <HI>Circum-ca&s;e,</HI> &s;ays Mo&s;es, <HI>the fore&s;kin of your hearts, and be no more &s;tiff-necked.</HI> And the apo&s;tle plainly intimates the &s;ame, when he makes the true <HI>circumci&s;ion of the heart, in the &s;pirit, and not in the letter, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men, but of God.</HI> Their various wa&s;hings and purgations preached to them their defilement by &s;in, and the nece&s;&s;ity of inward and outward &s;ancti|fication. Their thank offerings were an acknow|ledgment of their dependance on God, teaching them and us how rea&s;onable it is we &s;hould daily own our daily benefactor. Every offering for &s;in repre&s;ented the evil and demerit of it, and was a &s;ignal that the &s;inner de&s;erved to die, that his life was forfeited to the ju&s;tice of God. Accordingly, there was a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in con&s;tantly accompa|nied &s;uch &s;acrifices, by which the nece&s;&s;ity of re|pentance and reformation was urged upon the of|fenders, and was owned by them. In &s;hort, the law was an emblem of the go&s;pel and the religion thereof. It held forth in a figure the death and &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, the purity, holine&s;s, and obedi|ence of chri&s;tians, their &s;eparation from the world, and from all uncleanne&s;s. All the &s;acrifices that referred to &s;in, all the laws about uncleanne&s;s, and means appointed for purifying, were public &s;ignifi|cations of the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s and purity both in heart and life. And we &s;hould now read them as &s;o many admonitions thereto, and cannot better improve them, than by a thorough compliance with the rules of the go&s;pel, which are the moral of tho&s;e in&s;titutions. In this &s;en&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that even this part of Scripture, which may be looked upon of lea&s;t value and u&s;e, and that &s;ome have very rudely objected again&s;t as ab&s;urd, and unworthy of a divine lawgiver; that this is profitable to the church. It an&s;wered wi&s;e
<PB N="343" REF="028262_0343_0FD7F7A11CEDD688">and great purpo&s;e at the time it was given, and was in force, and continues &s;till highly u&s;eful. Let me add,</P>
<P N="4">4. The moral parts of Scripture are profitable. By which, I mean, tho&s;e books that concern the direction of our faith, the furni&s;hing us with good principles, and e&s;pecially that concern the conduct of our lives.</P>
<P>The book of Job repre&s;ents a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene of providence, full of great and excellent in&s;tructi|on. Particularly it repre&s;ents the malice and in|du&s;try of Satan in pro&s;ecuting his de&s;igns again&s;t us; how watchful he is to gain and improve occa|&s;ions to our hurt. This appears in his management again&s;t Job. He waits and &s;eeks for a commi&s;&s;ion again&s;t him, which he no &s;ooner obtains, than he improves it to its utmo&s;t extent, and as far as he could go. Here we are taught what the apo&s;tle long after takes notice of, that <HI>we wre&s;tle not again&s;t fle&s;h and blood, but again&s;t principalities, again&s;t powers, again&s;t the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, again&s;t &s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places.</HI></P>
<P>This book al&s;o repre&s;ents the &s;afety of good men under the divine protection. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not made an hedge about him,</HI> &s;ays Satan concerning Job, <HI>and about his hou&s;e, and about all that he has on every &s;ide?</HI> Our families, per&s;ons, I may add, our names, reputations, our bodies, and &s;ouls, all are in the hands of God; neither men nor devils can hurt us without permi&s;&s;ion from heaven. This we learn from that ancient book, it may be, the mo&s;t anci|ent in the world, written many thou&s;and years ago. And how comfortable is it to find it there,? Good men are &s;till encircled by the &s;ame divine arm. God makes <HI>an hedge about them, and about all that they have. Lord, how are they increa&s;ed that trouble me?</HI> &s;ays <HI>David, many there be which &s;ay of my &s;oul, there is no help for him in God.</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds, <HI>But thou,
<PB N="344" REF="028262_0344_0FD7F7AD7B5262D8">O Lord, art a &s;hield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</HI> And &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered.</HI></P>
<P>Again, It repre&s;ents the &s;overeignty of divine providence in the government of the world, and in the di&s;po&s;al of the affairs of particular per&s;ons. The devil could do nothing again&s;t Job without a commi&s;&s;ion from heaven. And that which I would here more e&s;pecially ob&s;erve, is, that his upright, good, and perfect Man, as he is called, is by the providence of God brought under a cour&s;e of exerci&s;es and trials, a &s;everity of di&s;cipline, the greate&s;t that, it may be, any ever met with. God is righteous in all his works, but he is &s;overeign in all his providences; and we &s;hould learn by this in&s;tance, to &s;ubmit to him an any, in all his rebukes how heavy &s;oever. He has wi&s;e ends in all he doth; will be faithful to his word, and take care of his upright, &s;incere &s;ervants. But this does not exempt them from trials and &s;ufferings. When you &s;ee Job, &s;o eminent and holy a man, pa&s;s through &s;uch a &s;eries of afflictions, amazing afflic|tions; learn to reverence the divine &s;overeignty. Do not think much at any of the trials that may be your lot and whatever God doth, own his authority; <HI>Be &s;till, and know that he is God.</HI></P>
<P>Father, this book repre&s;ents to us an example of patience truly glorious, not without flaws and imperfections, but yet truly excellent and glorious. God &s;mote Job, lies in the du&s;t, and when he was &s;tripped of all, &s;ubmits and adores. <HI>The Lord hath given,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Lord hath taken, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</HI> And even after a mo&s;t di&s;mal train of calamities, it is remarked of him, that <HI>in all this Job finned n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, nor charged God fooli&s;hly.</HI> We have heard of the patience of Job, as the apo&s;tle ex|pre&s;&s;es it. We here read the hi&s;tory of it, and we
<PB N="345" REF="028262_0345_0FD7F7B04D938660">&s;hould &s;et it before us for our admonition in our adver&s;ities.</P>
<P>And then, this divine book repre&s;ents God in his &s;overeignty, maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s, and that with more life and advantage than perhaps any other book in the world. It gives us &s;uch a view of him in his works and providence, and his excellencies, and &s;hould awe and impre&s;s our minds, and &s;ilence our complaints. Even Job forgot him&s;elf, and was too bold, till God came forth and di&s;played his glory; and this reduced and humbled him. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but now mine eye &s;eeth thee, wherefore I abhor my&s;elf, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>Here is repre&s;ented the weakne&s;s and infirmity of good men, even the be&s;t of men. It was one de&s;ign of God in this di&s;pen&s;ation towards Job, to exerci&s;e and manife&s;t the integrity, and uprightne&s;s of his &s;ervant, to confute Satan, and &s;hew that Job was not an hypocrite, as he in&s;inuated. But though Job &s;hewed his integrity he &s;hewed al&s;o his infirm|ity; though Satan was baffled, Job was humbled. And, it may be, had he &s;tood his ground under &s;uch &s;hocking trials, without di&s;covering any frailties, it might have been more dangerous to him than his mi&s;carriages. God hereby humbled him, taught him dependance, let him &s;ee his meanne&s;s and in&s;uf|ficiency. Good men, the greate&s;t men in this life can go through no difficult work, no difficult trials, but it will many ways appear they are men, but men, &s;inful, frail creatures. And though they are owned, accepted and honored of God, it is &s;till upon terms of humility and repentance, and in &s;uch a way as leaves the &s;ucce&s;s of all, and the glory of all, to God, and to the prai&s;e of his grace.</P>
<P>I add, here is repre&s;ented the care of God to|wards wards his faithful &s;ervants, and the comfortable i&s;&s;ue of all their trials and conflicts. We do not,
<PB N="346" REF="028262_0346_0FD7F7B11C4CB488">I grant, always &s;ee this at pre&s;ent, and in the man|ner, as in Job's ca&s;e: But <HI>it &s;hall be well with the righteous;</HI> God will not for&s;ake the &s;oul that &s;eeks him. <HI>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright man, for the end of that man is peace.</HI> God will &s;up|port per&s;ons of this character under all their bur|dens, dangers and fears; and in due time and man|ner deliver them. <HI>No temptation &s;hall befall them but what is common to men,</HI> and God <HI>will with the temptation make a way to e&s;cape, that they may be able to bear it.</HI> They may be ob&s;cured for a ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, <HI>per|&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken; ca&s;t down, not de&s;troyed.</HI> No, their <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hall <HI>go forth as brightne&s;s, and</HI> their <HI>&s;alvation as a lamp that burneth.</HI> Job was conducted through a &s;cene of &s;orrows and calami|ties, that even his three pious and wi&s;e friends, thought it would have been his ruin. But God meant not &s;o. He had de&s;igns of kindne&s;s towards him, and he knew how to deliver the righteous out of temptation, and to &s;ave him in it, and under it. All good men may expect the like &s;uperintendency of divine providence, and &s;upply of divine grace. If your hearts be upright with God, as Job's was, God will be your defence as he was his. He will re&s;train your enemies, pardon your infirmities, though it is fit he &s;hould &s;hew you them, and hum|ble you for them, and at la&s;t be your &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there are many glorious le&s;&s;ons in this book, a &s;cence of providence that one may peru&s;e and contemplate with exceeding great advantage. O learn to under&s;tand the u&s;e of your Bible, and of the &s;everal parts thereof, and I am confident, you will never think meanly of it.</P>
<P>I might illu&s;trate my point by the like reflecti|ons on the book of P&s;alms, and the re&s;t, but have not time. One great advantage of that book is, that it de&s;cribes the various &s;tates, po&s;tures and frames of devout &s;ouls. It &s;ometimes &s;hows you
<PB N="347" REF="028262_0347_0FD7F7B326626698">the good man low and down, full of fears and de&s;|pondency, lying in &s;ackcloth, and watering his couch with his tears. And then ri&s;ing out of this &s;tate, putting off his &s;able, and girded with glad|ne&s;s. It is indeed a glorious trea&s;ure of devotion, as well as a directory for life. And I am &s;atisfied it would be well worth our while, not only fre|quently to read it, but to commit as much as we can of it to our memories. This is what many of the primitive chri&s;tians have done, and others &s;ince, with great advantage. If this does not turn to better account than furni&s;hing, I might &s;ay debauch|ing your minds with &s;uch &s;orry tra&s;h as plays and romances generally, at lea&s;t, are, I am utterly mi&s;|taken. The one is the food, &s;olace, and en|tertainment of divine minds; what &s;hall I &s;ay of the other? but that they are hu&s;ks for &s;wine to feed upon.</P>
<P>The book of Solomon's Proverbs and Eccle&s;ia&s;tes have a great deal of excellency in them, and are highly u&s;eful. The one is a lively de&s;cription of the vanity of pre&s;ent enjoyments, and the other affords the mo&s;t admirable maxims of wi&s;dom. Many of the di&s;cour&s;es of the moral philo&s;ophers, as Plutarch, Seneca, Epictetus, and Antonine, are ju&s;tly celebrated in the world. And indeed they want not their excellencies, great excellencies. But here we have not only higher &s;trains of wi&s;dom, but the precepts of it delivered with more certain|ty and authority. The philo&s;ophers were, many of them, wi&s;e ob&s;ervers of human nature. They knew its infirmities in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and knew how to pre&s;cribe for a cure. But the writers of the&s;e di|vine books were conducted by the author of nature, that perfectly under&s;tands man, knows what there is in him; and therefore their maxims are recom|mended to us, not only by the intrin&s;ic excellency
<PB N="348" REF="028262_0348_0FD7F7B46356C4A8">of them, but by this di&s;tingui&s;hing circum&s;tance, that they are all true, infallibly true. And we may be &s;ure, as they are true, &s;o they are pertinent to the ca&s;es they refer to, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God &s;hall be effectual to tho&s;e that receive and apply them.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e hints recommend the Bible to you, and the &s;everal parts thereof. If there be &s;ome things in it, we do not well under&s;tand, we &s;hould not ca|vil again&s;t the whole on that account, but &s;ay as the philo&s;opher did when he had read the writings of a man of fame, <HI>what I under&s;tand is excellent,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and I pre&s;ume what I under&s;tand not is &s;o too.</HI> Cer|tainly this reverence is due to God, who&s;e book the Bible is, due to infinte wi&s;dom. Acquaint your|&s;elves with the &s;everal parts of Scripture, though you &s;hould be mo&s;t conver&s;ant in tho&s;e parts that are mo&s;t u&s;eful. Be&s;ides the knowledge we &s;hall thereby gain, we may expect the divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing with us when thus employed. When we are diligently and &s;eriou&s;ly reading our Bible, we are on holy ground, as I may &s;ay, and con&s;e|quently, may hope, God will be with us, &s;hining in upon our minds, drawing our affections to him&s;elf, &s;hedding abroad his love in our hearts, pouring out his &s;pirit upon us, more and more &s;anctifying us by his word. O endeavour that the <HI>word of God</HI> may <HI>dwell richly in you,</HI> remembering the character of the ble&s;&s;ed man, that <HI>his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE XIV. PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS UPON THE SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I COME now to the application of the many di&s;cour&s;es I have given you, and &s;hall di&s;patch what I further de&s;ign in a &s;ingle &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;o conclude the &s;ubject. And here I &s;hall only offer a few practical reflections. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the Scripture be given by in&s;piration of God, it ought certainly to be treated with great e&s;teem and reverence among men. As it is the word of God, indited by the Holy Spirit, a book &s;ent from heaven; it challenges a peculiar regard, and &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all human wri|tings. This every one mu&s;t allow that believes it to be in&s;pired. Let us therefore be careful to treat this holy book in a &s;uitable manner. The apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es his great &s;atisfaction concerning the The&s;&s;alonians, that they received the go&s;pel preached to them, <HI>not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God.</HI> Let it appear that we thus receive the Bible, receive it as a divine reve|lation, particularly by our reverence of it. If it be a&s;ked, how mu&s;t we &s;hew our reverence? I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. By a diligent attentive &s;tudy of it. The ex|cellency
<PB N="350" REF="028262_0350_0FD7F7BB59C07010">and u&s;efulne&s;s of the matter of Scripture demands this of us. But what I now in&s;i&s;t upon, is the con&s;ideration of the author. It is from God, and therefore a &s;pecial reverence and e&s;teem is due to it; which we &s;hould manife&s;t by our atten|tion thereto, and careful peru&s;al of it.</P>
<P>All writings are commonly received or neglect|ed, according to the qualifications or characters of their authors. Nothing is expected from books publi&s;hed by ignorant, trifling, or mercenary wri|ters, and therefore &s;uch are generally de&s;pi&s;ed by men of &s;en&s;e; while the productions of authors of a different character, of better learning, capacity, and more integrity, are proportionably better re|ceived and e&s;teemed, and more pains is taken to find out their de&s;igns, to take in their &s;chemes, and to under&s;tand their arguments and way of rea&s;on|ing. They are read with application, and not only once, but often, it may be, according to the cha|racter of the author, or the opinion of the book it|&s;elf. And in the writings of tho&s;e great men, that hold the fir&s;t rank, every &s;entence and line, and almo&s;t every word, is thought to have its weight, and not to be &s;et down carele&s;sly, without a mean|ing or nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e. With what pains and dili|gence have men weighed the particular words, and even the &s;ituation of them, in the compo&s;ures of Plato, Tully, Homer, Virgil, Horace, Terence, and others. Now if the reputation of wi&s;dom and &s;kill in human books, thus commands our reverence and attention; what is due to the book of God? I am not comparing the contents of the&s;e writings, the important de&s;ign and tendency of them; but merely con&s;idering the authors, and I know you will allow me to &s;ay, that if we reverence this or that piece of antiquity for the name of its author, no book challenges &s;o much reverence from us as the Bible.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="028262_0351_0FD7F7C3B03D4228">
Well then, let us &s;hew our regard to it by the pains we take in it. Many have &s;pent their time, and the greate&s;t part of their lives in critici&s;ms up|on &s;ome of the heathen authors, &s;ettling the reading and marking the beauties thereof. How will this diligence reproach us, if we neglect a book that can claim the only Wi&s;e God for its author?</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hould &s;hew our e&s;teem and reverence for the Bible, by a ready and univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;tion to its authority, even in &s;uch things as we cannot fully under&s;tand, nor are able to account for. We are apt to pay a &s;ort of implicit veneration to the wri|tings of great men. Much more &s;hould we do it to the word of God. As he is infinitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, and good; we may be &s;ure he is neither de|ceived him&s;elf, nor can deceive us; that nothing comes from him that is fal&s;e, nothing that is weak, nothing that is imperfect; that all he has revealed is true, pertinent, wi&s;e, and beneficial; proper to an&s;wer the end he had in it. And accordingly we &s;hould entertain every part of his revelation with reverence, knowing from whence it proceeds. The want of this principle has ruined the faith and religion of multitudes. They object again&s;t this or that in the Bible, becau&s;e it does not agree with their rea&s;on, that is, with their prejudices and fan|cies; as if infinite wi&s;dom mu&s;t be mea&s;ured and governed by our narrow and &s;hort views. Thus &s;ome find fault with the rites and ceremonies of the Mo&s;aical law. They cannot under&s;tand the rati|onale of them and are ready to call them ab&s;urd; thus mea&s;uring God by them&s;elves. Others object to the great doctrine of atonement by the &s;acrifice of the Son of God and &s;aving &s;inners through his mediation. This they cannot under&s;tand and therefore will not believe. Some from the &s;ame vanity neglect the &s;acraments of the New Te&s;ta|ment. They cannot &s;ee of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> advantage it is to
<PB N="352" REF="028262_0352_0FD7F7C6A7D3BD60">eat a bit of bread and drink a little wine; what this can contribute to the improvement of the mind. And it is well if &s;ome do not encourage them&s;elves in gro&s;s &s;ins to the like con&s;ideration. Surely, &s;ay they, God will not damn a man for taking a little plea&s;ure out of the way. What harm can there be in gratifying the inclinations God has given us in in&s;tances agreeable thereto? they cannot &s;ee any injury to the Supreme Being herein, nor believe he will ever puni&s;h offences of this kind &s;o &s;everely as is pretended. But this is not to reverence the Bible and treat it as a revelation from God, but to &s;et up our own fooli&s;h fancies in oppo&s;ition thereto, to make our&s;elves God's coun&s;ellors, and even correctors. And indeed the &s;ame principle would carry us to cen&s;ure any of the works of nature, and find fault with them as not rea&s;onable, not well contrived, not well placed. And thus vain men profanely change place with God, get upon his throne and bring him to the bar. Infinite patience! that bears with &s;uch worms, and does not frown them into hell in a moment. If the Scripture is given by in|&s;piration of God, what we have to do, is to make all our rea&s;onings &s;ubmit to it. Though we do not under&s;tand &s;ome of its pre&s;criptions, it is enough they are from heaven. That &s;hould determine our faith, and &s;ilence all cavils. We know not what it is to be creatures till it is thus with us, much le&s;s chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="3">3. Shew your reverence and e&s;teem of the Bible by a firm adherence to it, and to the religion it pre|&s;cribes, whatever temptation you may have to the contrary. It is the mo&s;t valuable trea&s;ure God has entru&s;ted us with, and we &s;hould re&s;olve by his grace, that no terrors, nor death, &s;hall wre&s;t it out of our hands. The zeal of the primitive chri&s;tians in this re&s;pect, is well known. They would rather &s;ubmit to any tortures, than give up their Bibles
<PB N="353" REF="028262_0353_0FD7F7C97B79FB90">at the demand of their enemies. And tho&s;e among them that through fear complied, and would quit their Bibles to &s;ave their lives, were looked upon as infamous, and rejected as unworthy of the com|munion of the chri&s;tian church. They were called <HI>traditores,</HI> &s;uch as delivered up their Bibles, a name of the utmo&s;t reproach and &s;candal among them. Eu&s;ebius mentions one Marinus, a military man, who being di&s;covered to be a chri&s;tian, was ordered to determine in three hours, whether he would re|linqui&s;h his office, or his profe&s;&s;ion. In the mean time, Theobectus, bi&s;hop of Cae&s;aria, comes to him and &s;hewed him a &s;word, the badge of his office, and a Bible, the repo&s;itory of the chri&s;tian faith, and bid him chu&s;e which of the two he would have, for he mu&s;t not keep both; upon which he pre|&s;ently cho&s;e the Bible, and was crowned with mar|tyrdom. Should we ever meet with the like trial, we &s;hould make the like choice. We do not treat the Bible worthy its original, if it be not dearer to us than our lives. Nor &s;hould we part with the religion of the Bible, and give it up in complai|&s;ance to the fa&s;hions of the age, or humors of tho&s;e we conver&s;e with. The Bible is from heaven: believe it, live by it, whatever mea&s;ures others are plea&s;ed to walk by. Let this pre&s;cribe the rules of your conver&s;ation, your religious wor&s;hip, and of all your actions, and be not a&s;hamed of the religion of the Bible, becau&s;e it may be not agreeable to the cu&s;toms and modes that may obtain in the world. A chri&s;tian mu&s;t herein be re&s;olute. The holy Scriptures are his rule, and the reverence he has for them, mu&s;t carry him through all di&s;courage|ments and oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">4. Shew your e&s;teem and reverence of the Bible by the manner in which you read it and conver&s;e with it. Even an outward reverence is due. Peo|ple &s;hould put their bodies into a decent po&s;ture
<PB N="354" REF="028262_0354_0FD7F7C984024A78">when they read the word of God, and e&s;pecially &s;hould be careful to po&s;&s;e&s;s their minds with re|verence and devotion. Con&s;ider it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> divine book, that God is &s;peaking to you, and that you are conver&s;ing with him in it, and accordingly be|have your&s;elves becoming &s;uch a pre&s;ence, with a due deference and re&s;pect to &s;o high an authority. Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. Whenever you mention any part of Scripture, let it be with &s;uitable reverence and e&s;teem. Do not make the Bible a common-place book of je&s;ts, as the manner of &s;ome is, quoting a text of Scrip|ture to divert their company, which favours not a little of profanene&s;s, and indeed is like Bel&s;hazzar's carou&s;ing in the con&s;ecrating ve&s;&s;els of the templ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Guard again&s;t all libertini&s;m of this kind. Remem|ber the Bible is a &s;acred book, and do not pro&s;ti|tute it to &s;o low a purpo&s;e as &s;erving a je&s;t, borrow|ing its phra&s;es to adorn a piece of wit, or promote mirth and laughter. Farther,</P>
<P N="6">6. Shew your e&s;teem of the Bible, by your de|light in it. David was famous for this, as is known to all that know any thing of his character: <HI>O how I love thy law,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it is my meditation all the day.</HI> And he him&s;elf makes it the character of the pious man, that <HI>he delights in the law of the Lord, and</HI> therein <HI>doth he meditate day and night.</HI> And as this is due from us, in con&s;ideration that God is the au|thor of this book, &s;o it is due on the account of the excellency and u&s;efulne&s;s of it, the tendency it has to improve and enrich the mind. It is ob&s;ervable, that after the ju&s;t now mentioned character of the good man, That <HI>his delight is in the law of the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> it follows, <HI>He &s;hall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in &s;ea|&s;on; his leaf al&s;o &s;hall not wither, and what&s;oever he doth &s;hall pro&s;per.</HI> He is ordinarily the be&s;t chri&s;|tian that is mo&s;t conver&s;ant in his Bible, and that takes mo&s;t pains in the &s;urvey of it. He is mo&s;t
<PB N="355" REF="028262_0355_0FD7F7C988FE3348">likely to be fruitful, thoroughly furni&s;hed to all good works. When the word of God dwells richly in you, you will be able to admoni&s;h one another, and to abound in the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Once more,</P>
<P N="7">7. Show your e&s;teem of the Bible, by propagating the knowledge of it, and e&s;pecially in your families and among your children. This has been the way of good people in all ages. <HI>Timothy from a child knew the holy Scriptures,</HI> as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the ver&s;e before my text. The Jews were com|manded <HI>to teach the words of their law to their chil|dren,</HI> to teach them <HI>diligently unto them, and talk of them when they &s;at in their hou&s;es, when they walked by the way, when they lay down, and when they ro&s;e up.</HI> And however defective they were in many other things, they expre&s;&s;ed an extraordinary zeal in this matter. Their children were trained up in the know|ledge of their law, even from their infancy; and were &s;o expert therein, that Jo&s;ephus tells us, they knew every thing in it as fully as their own names. And the like care was &s;hewn by the primitive chri&s;|tians. Nor indeed can it be &s;aid, that we treat the Bible as the word of God, and pay a veneration to it as &s;uch, if we neglect to teach it to our children. The humor of the age, as it runs counter to almo&s;t every thing that favors of true religion, &s;o it has given an odd turn to the education of young per&s;ons. One of the early fathers of the church gives direc|tions in one of his epi&s;tles for the education of a young lady of a noble chri&s;tian family, he advi&s;es, that as &s;oon as &s;he was capable &s;he &s;hould learn the P&s;alms, Proverbs and Eccle&s;ia&s;tes; next he taught the four go&s;pels, to have them always in her hands; then get the Acts and Epi&s;tles by heart, and after that pa&s;s to the reading of the Prophets. How lit|tle there is of this in the pre&s;ent di&s;cipline of mo&s;t families, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay. Mu&s;ic, dancing,
<PB N="356" REF="028262_0356_0FD7F7CAF6B07530">play-books, and &s;ome light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accompli&s;h|ments, are the main things attended to now in edu|cation; which no doubt is one great cau&s;e of that degeneracy we &s;o much complain of in the profe&s;&s;i|on of the chri&s;tian religion. Certainly, we &s;hould either di&s;own this book or make another u&s;e of it than commonly we do.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nlarge farther on this point. We &s;hould treat the Bible with reverence, and &s;hew our regard to it in the ways I have mentioned. This is my fir&s;t rellection.</P>
<P N="2">II. Is the <HI>Scripture given by in&s;piration of God, and profitable</HI> to the church, as you have heard; what rea&s;on have we to be thankful for &s;o great a favor and privilege as the holy Bible, and that we have it in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall briefly mention a few circum&s;tances, as &s;o many motives to grati|tude to the good providence of God on the account of this enjoyment.</P>
<P>You &s;hould be thankful not only that you have a divine revelation, but have it entire. It is account|ed among the di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges of the Jews, that they had <HI>the oracles of God committed</HI> to them. How much greater mu&s;t our advantages be who have not only their Scripture, but a great addition thereto; have a fuller and clearer light, have the darkne&s;s and difficulties of that di&s;pen&s;ation they were under removed, and enjoy the entire &s;y&s;tem of divine doctrines and laws. Certainly if they were &s;o highly favored, the members of the chri&s;ti|an church are much more favored; and con&s;e|quently, under greater engagements to gratitude and adoration. We &s;hould be thankful that this glorious book has been pre&s;erved and brought down to us &s;afe and uncorrupt. I before took no|tice of the rage of enemies again&s;t it, and what at|tempts have been made to de&s;troy it, by Antiochus Epiphanes under the Old Te&s;tament, by Diocle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an,
<PB N="357" REF="028262_0357_0FD7F7CC32C36C20">and Julian, per&s;ecuting heathen emperors after|wards. And yet God has watched over this inva|luable trea&s;ure, and lodged it &s;afe in our hands. O rejoice in his providence, and give him the glo|ry of his own work.</P>
<P>Again, we &s;hould be thankful that we have it in our own tongue: a privilege, you know, our fore|fathers did not enjoy. Some that pretended to be the keepers of this trea&s;ure, locked it up from the people, and took away the key of knowledge. This glorious light was by this means put under a bu&s;hel. Whereas now it &s;hines among us in all its lu&s;tre. The heavenly manne falls about our tent door, and how much are we indebted to God for this. The churches of Germany in the beginning of the reformation had an anniver&s;ary thank&s;giving, which they called, <HI>the fea&s;t of the tran&s;lation of the Bible.</HI> We &s;hould be often devoutly acknowledging the goodne&s;s of God herein, and celebrating the boun|ty of his providence in this in&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>I might add, that we have rea&s;on to be thankful we have the Bible not only tran&s;lated, but printed. About three hundred years ago when printing was fir&s;t found out, a copy thereof, tolerably written in vellum, would co&s;t at lea&s;t a hundred pounds &s;ter|ling, whereas by the invention of printing, the Scriptures are put into every one's hand; the poore&s;t chri&s;tian needs not want a Bible, if he has but an heart to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Again, we &s;hould be thankful that we have &s;o many helps to under&s;tand the Bible; as by con&s;tant mini&s;try of the word, a variety of u&s;eful commen|taries, and other good books written upon the Scripture and the particular doctrines thereof.</P>
<P>Once more, we ought to con&s;ider, that the pro|vidence of God in all the&s;e in&s;tances, has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed us from others. To us are <HI>committed the oracles of God.</HI> The&s;e are the peculiar glory of the
<PB N="358" REF="028262_0358_0FD7F7CFA1D56C38">chri&s;tian church. <HI>He hath &s;hewn his word unto Ja|cob, his &s;tatutes and his judgments unto I&s;rael; he hoth not dealt &s;o with any nation; as for his judgments they have not known them.</HI> This may be &s;aid of us chri&s;tians, we have the Bible, which the greate&s;t part of the world are utter &s;trangers to. Let us mind the admonition of the P&s;almi&s;t hereupon, <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord,</HI> &s;ays he. Surely we ought to prai&s;e him on this account, to &s;peak and live his prai&s;es. I may add, if we do not prai&s;e him in higher &s;trains, and live in a better manner than tho&s;e that know not God, than the unhappy <HI>people that &s;it in darkne&s;s, and in the region and &s;hadow of death,</HI> great will be our guilt, and great our con|demnation.</P>
<P N="3">III. If the Bible be the word of God, and <HI>all Scripture is given by divine in&s;piration,</HI> how danger|ous mu&s;t it be to reject it? it is not only great folly, as it deprives us of the light, in&s;truction, and com|fort of the Scripture, and all the glorious advanta|ges of &s;o excellent a revelation; but it is a flagrant in&s;tance of pre&s;umption and &s;in, a high contempt of the goodne&s;s of God, and of his wi&s;dom and autho|rity. On which account the ca&s;e of our dei&s;ts mu&s;t be exceedingly deplorable. Indeed they &s;eem to put them&s;elves out of the way of &s;alvation. <HI>If they hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets,</HI> &s;ays the parable, <HI>nei|ther will they be per&s;uaded though one ro&s;e from the dead:</HI> Intimating, that &s;uch as will not receive the in&s;truction the Scripture affords, and comply with the way of &s;alvation therein propo&s;ed, will yield to no other means of conviction, though never &s;o &s;en|&s;ible and glaring, and con&s;equently mu&s;t remain in their ob&s;tinacy, and peri&s;h in their &s;in. Natural rea&s;on, the light and conduct of con&s;cience, and any other methods the&s;e per&s;ons may pretend to va|lue and prefer, will, I am afraid, be &s;ound in&s;ufficient. <HI>If they will not believe Mo&s;es and the prophets,</HI> Chri&s;t
<PB N="359" REF="028262_0359_0FD7F7D0A96486F0">and his apo&s;tles; it would &s;eem there is no help for them.</P>
<P>And there is this aggravation in the unbelief of our modern dei&s;ts, who live in a chri&s;tian nation, which the mere negative faith of the heathens has not; that the one never had the Bible laid before them: the other reject it, and all the &s;trong evi|dence with which it comes atte&s;ted, and with which it offers it&s;elf unto them. I leave them to the righ|teous judgment of God. But to me their ca&s;e ap|pears exceedingly hazardous; and, it may be, their guilt approaches the neare&s;t to the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t of any, men now adays are capable of committing. O let us not <HI>refu&s;e him that &s;peaketh from heaven. If he that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es's law, died without mercy, under two or three witne&s;&s;es: of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and done de|&s;pite unto the &s;pirit of grace. If the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t recompence of reward, how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation; which at fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was con|firmed to us by them that heard him, God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s with &s;igns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> To have the Bible among us, and yet contemn and de&s;pi&s;e it, is &s;o great a &s;in, that, I think, I may &s;ay, how &s;trange &s;oever the expre&s;&s;ion may look, a wi&s;e man would rather choo&s;e to be annihilated, than live and die under the guilt of it. Hereupon I add,</P>
<P N="4">IV. As the Scripture is the word of God, a re|velation from heaven, and of &s;uch eminent u&s;e to the church, as you have heard, let us endeavor to make a right u&s;e of it; to read it, &s;tudy it, and conver&s;e with it, in a &s;uitable &s;erious manner. And here &s;everal directions might be offered. But I
<PB N="360" REF="028262_0360_0FD7F7DE0A92A270">&s;hall only &s;tay to mention a few very briefly: and indeed it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, it being a &s;ub|ject I have often touched upon and &s;poke to.</P>
<P>Endeavour to under&s;tand the holy Scripture. It is to no purpo&s;e that <HI>God has wrote to us the great things of his law,</HI> if they have been and are, <HI>&s;trange things</HI> to us. Ignorance will &s;eal up the Bible from us as effectually, as if it was in an unknown Tongue. Take care therefore to under&s;tand your Bibles. To which purpo&s;e &s;ermons and commen|taries are u&s;eful, a diligent peru&s;al of the Bible, a comparing one Scripture with another is u&s;eful, the laying a&s;ide prejudices, and preconceived opi|nions, being willing any thing &s;hould be true, and receiving every thing as true, that you have rea&s;on to think is taught there; this is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary. Prayer and dependence on God, and his Spirit for illumination is al&s;o highly u&s;eful; in the u&s;e of the&s;e and &s;uch like means, &s;tudy the Bible; often put the que&s;tion to your&s;elves, that Philip did to the Ethi|opian Eunuch, <HI>Under&s;tande&s;t thou what thou reade&s;t?</HI> Acts viii. 30. and never think you read to purpo&s;e, unle&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure you under&s;tand what you read.</P>
<P>Read it with faith. <HI>The word preached,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,</HI> Heb. iv. 2. Unbelief will &s;trip the word of all its power and efficacy, and leave it a dead letter, and altogether u&s;ele&s;s. The apo&s;tle rejoices in behalf of the The&s;&s;alonians, when he ob|&s;erved they <HI>mixed the word with faith. For this cau&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, in the place I have already cited, <HI>we thank God without cea&s;ing, becau&s;e when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh al&s;o in you that believe.</HI> It works effectually in them that believe, and in them only. O endeavor for faith, a divine faith. Re|ceive
<PB N="361" REF="028262_0361_0FD7F7E21E02F7D8">the Scripture as the word of God; give a firm a&s;&s;ent to it; look upon its rules as divine, its promi&s;es and threatnings as faithful and true; and entertain it with the &s;ame regard, as if God mani|fe&s;ted him&s;elf in a vi&s;ible manner, or &s;pake to you with an audible voice. And remember that your faith, if it be of the right kind, will always produce obedience. He that believes the wages of &s;in is death, will be afraid of &s;in, and if he is not, it is a &s;ufficient argument he doth not believe. I may ap|ply here what is &s;aid of the &s;ervants of Pharaoh, when the plague of hail was threatned, <HI>That tho&s;e of them who feared the word of the Lord, made his &s;er|vants and his cattle &s;lee into the hou&s;es; but he that regarded not the word of the Lord, left his &s;ervants and cattle in the field.</HI> If we regard and believe the word of God, we &s;hall comply with its advice, avoid the paths it marks out as leading to de&s;truction; attend to the duties it pre&s;cribes, and walk in the way it directs to, as the way of life and &s;alvation. And if we do not do this, it is certain we do not believe. And con&s;equently, like Pharaoh's &s;er|vants &s;hall fall under the judgment God has threat|ened. O beg for faith, and that God would in|crea&s;e your faith. Look upon every thing in the Bible as true, certain and infallible, being a&s;&s;ured, that not one iota thereof &s;hall fall to the ground till all be fulfilled. If we did this it would have a glo|rious effect upon us. What manner of per&s;ons &s;hould we then be in all holy conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Read and &s;tudy with humility, as mode&s;t learn|ers, prepare to receive all the in&s;truction there of|fered. Have a care of a proud, carping, cavilling humor; and if you meet with any thing that &s;eems to you uncouth, do not cen&s;ure and de&s;pi&s;e it, be|cau&s;e you do not under&s;tand it. In&s;tead of that, maintain a reverence of God upon your minds, and
<PB N="362" REF="028262_0362_0FD7DAE9F0CBC688">wait for his illumination, praying with David, <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 18. Nothing is more nece&s;|&s;ary than this. <HI>He re&s;i&s;ts the proud, but gives grace, yea more grace, to the humble. The meek will he guide in judgment, the meek will he teach his way.</HI></P>
<P>And then apply what you read; bring it home to your&s;elves, compare your&s;elves with the rules of the word, and endeavor to conform your&s;elves thereto. The Scripture is profitable for correction, correct your&s;elves by it; for in&s;tance, &s;uch Scriptures as concern the government of the tongue, the thoughts, de&s;ires and affections; &s;uch Scriptures as pre&s;cribe to you in your re&s;pective relations; and for the management of your callings and conver&s;e. Your doctrines whether &s;ecret, private, or public; lay them before you, mea&s;ure, and correct your&s;elves by them. And I am &s;atisfied it would be well worth while to have a li&s;t of &s;uch Scriptures drawn up by you for con&s;tant u&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, beg the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's holy Spirit in order to the &s;tudying and improving your Bibles. The Bible is the book of the Spirit, over which he pre&s;ides, and which he teaches. Many have thought they have got the be&s;t of their knowledge of religion and of the Scriptures upon their knees. And I do not think there is any enthu&s;ia&s;m in that method of &s;tudy, accompanied with the u&s;e of other proper means. But I leave the&s;e things to your &s;erious retired thoughts, without further enlarg|ment: and leave you to the divine conduct and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
