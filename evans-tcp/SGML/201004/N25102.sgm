<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON Mr. GALLATIN's SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Speech of a Repre&s;entative is publi&s;hed in a pamphlet, and tran&s;mitted by its author through the country, it becomes a fair &s;ubject for a free candid examination. It is addre&s;&s;ed, not to the hou&s;e, but to the people; to convince, not his fellow members, but his fellow citizens: and invites a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, not with|in but without doors. In my opinion, no &s;ubject better de&s;erves di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, than that which this Speech embraces. It &s;upports a principle, which, as I view it, mu&s;t be de|&s;troyed, or it will de&s;troy the government: for, if my judgment be right, both cannot &s;urvive. Yet the opinion which I am about to &s;upport, is, by the author of the Speech, even while he profe&s;&s;es to di&s;claim political infal|libility, bluntly declared to be palpably ab&s;urd, and as no|vel as it is ab&s;urd. Many things in the Speech will &s;atisfy us, that the victory of the Con&s;titution over the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the &s;ubject of the appropriations for the Briti&s;h Treaty, is affected to be con&s;idered by this
<PB N="2" REF="033268_0004_0FF6B296892FBAF8">&s;peaker, as but half won; and this Speech, on a more popular &s;ubject, is &s;pread over the country, to prepare the minds of the people for a more popular, and perhaps more &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition to Con&s;titutional principles, on a fu|ture occa&s;ion. The pa&s;t di&s;appointment, the time for re|flection, the character of the &s;peaker, and the humility with which his colleagues in oppo&s;ition compliment him with the palm, as the <HI>coryphaeus</HI> of the party; induce a belief, that his doctrine is now di&s;played in all its force, and to the utmo&s;t expectable advantage. If the oppo&s;ite doctrine can be made to appear neither ab&s;urd nor novel, it will be gaining a point; and if, on inve&s;tigation, it &s;hall appear to be rational and con&s;titutional, it will be gaining a <HI>great</HI> point, for the &s;ecurity of the Government, and the happine&s;s of the people of the United Sates.</P>
<P>As the incidental topics of the Speech are le&s;s or not e&s;&s;ential, I &s;hall confine my ob&s;ervations to the con&s;titu|tional principle involved in the debate which occa&s;ioned the Speech.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution, which ve&s;ted the executive power in the Pre&s;ident of the United States, declared that he &s;hall nominate, and, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint, amba&s;&s;adors, other public mi|ni&s;ters, and con&s;uls.</P>
<P>In July, 1790, Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed a law, authori&s;ing the Pre&s;ident to draw from the trea&s;ury a &s;um not exceeding forty thou&s;and dollars annually, for the &s;upport of &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hall commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;erve the United States in foreign parts; and providing, "that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall not allow to any mini&s;ter plenipotentiary a greater &s;um, than at the rate of nine thou&s;and dollars <HI>per annum,</HI> as a compen&s;ation for all his per&s;onal &s;ervices and other ex|pences; nor a greater &s;um for the &s;ame, than four thou|&s;and
<PB N="3" REF="033268_0005_0FF6B29934AE6788">five hundred dollars <HI>per annum</HI> to a <HI>charg&egrave; des af|faires.</HI>" This law, as is often done when power is wi&s;hed to be retained, Congre&s;s limited to a duration of two years and the end of the &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>1</HI> United States Laws, <HI>175.</HI></NOTE>. In February, 1793, it was continued for other two years<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>2</HI> U. S. L. <HI>151.</HI></NOTE>; and in May, 1796, it was continued for one year; &s;till with the addi|tion of the &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>4</HI> U. S. Law <HI>115.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the different grades of public mini&s;ters known to the law of nations, the&s;e laws provided for the compen&s;a|tion of two; the grade of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, and that of <HI>charg&egrave; des affaires.</HI> Before May, 1796, the higher of the&s;e grades, a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, had been ap|pointed only to Britain, to France, and to Spain; to any other court a mini&s;ter of the inferior grade had been ap|pointed. In May, 1796, the Pre&s;ident thought proper to appoint a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Li&s;bon; and, in 1797, to appoint a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Berlin: and corre&s;pondent appropriations were provided by Con|gre&s;s, in May, 1796, and July, 1797, for tho&s;e years<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>4</HI> U. S. L. <HI>116.&mdash;5</HI> U. S. L. <HI>41.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The limitation of the former laws rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to bring the &s;ubject of foreign intercour&s;e again before Congre&s;s, in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, and continue the law of 1790. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this clau&s;e of the law, "That the Pre&s;ident &s;hall not allow to a mini&s;ter <HI>plenipotentiary</HI> a greater &s;um than at the rate of nine thou&s;and dollars <HI>per annum,</HI> as a compen&s;ation for all his per&s;onal &s;ervices and other expences; nor a greater &s;um for the &s;ame than four thou&s;and five hundred dollars <HI>per annum</HI> to a <HI>charg&egrave; des affaires.</HI>" Mr. Nicholas, an oppo&s;ition member, propo&s;ed to depart from the manner of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in the law
<PB N="4" REF="033268_0006_0FF6B216EC6357A0">of 1790, and ever &s;ince; by &s;triking out the word <HI>"ple|nipotentiary,"</HI> and in&s;erting, in lieu thereof, the words "to Great Britain, France and Spain;" and &s;triking out the words <HI>"charg&egrave; des affaires,"</HI> and in&s;erting, in lieu thereof, the words "any mini&s;ter to any other foreign nation."</P>
<P>This was an artful way of keeping the con&s;titutional que&s;tion out of view, by &s;eeming only to fix &s;alaries.&mdash; It &s;eemed to &s;ay, that only mini&s;ters to Britain, France, and Spain &s;hould have a &s;alary of nine thou&s;and dollars; and a mini&s;ter to any other court, a &s;alary of but four thou|&s;and five hundred. But as it fixed the &s;alaries, not as heretofore, according to the princiles of the law of nati|ons, by the grade of the mini&s;ter, but by the court to which he is &s;ent; it really &s;aid, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould not appoint a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to any other court than Britain, France, and Spain. It acknowledged the &s;tated &s;alaries to be ju&s;tly proportioned to the grades, but re&s;trained the grades. It limited the power of the Pre&s;i|dent not only in compen&s;ating but in appointing mini&s;ters. This is admitted in this &s;peech of Mr. Gallatin, in &s;up|port of Mr. Nicholas's amendment. He avows, "that the effect of the amendment will be to prevent an exten|&s;ion of our political connections with foreign nations; and though <HI>this</HI> amendment will not annihilate that e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, it will effectually check its exten&s;ion." Limitation of compen&s;ation will be a limitation of appointment; and though the Con&s;titution has ve&s;ted the Pre&s;ident with the power of appointment, and the power of conducting fo|reign intercour&s;e; Mr. G. contents, that it has ve&s;ted Congre&s;s with a power to defeat this power. This is the great point of his Speech.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="033268_0007_0FF6B259C181AA78">
He premi&s;es a doubt, "whether, although the Pre&s;ident may appoint amba&s;&s;adors, a law may not be nece&s;&s;ary to create the office, before an appointment takes place." On the ju&s;tice of this doubt he will not rely, and he di&s;cards it as u&s;ele&s;s. What more proper introduction to an argument, pro|fe&s;&s;ing to &s;hew a doctrine <HI>in&s;upportable, novel, and ab&s;urd,</HI> could a man u&s;e, who endeavoured to prove what he did not believe; than to begin with rai&s;ing a doubt of a doc|trine, acknowledged to be neither improbable nor novel; and not venturing to deny the doctrine, nor a&s;&s;ert the doubt?</P>
<P>He thus &s;tates and rea&s;ons on it. "The &s;ection of the con&s;titution empowering the Pre&s;ident to appoint mini&s;ters, &amp;c. recogni&s;es only the po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence of mini&s;ters, and does not create the office; the office to any foreign court, where we have not had any before, is created by the Pre|&s;ident's appointment. And it may even be doubtful, whe|ther a law be not nece&s;&s;ary to create the office, before an appointment takes place. This clau&s;e recogni&s;es al&s;o the exi&s;tence of judges of the &s;upreme court, and not only does it declare, that they, like foreign mini&s;ters, may ex|i&s;t, but another declares, that they &s;hall exi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Art. iii. Sect. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>; yet it has not been contended, that the office of judges of the &s;u|preme court was created by the Con&s;titution, or could be created by the mere appointment of the Pre&s;ident, without the previous authorization of a law, or that he had di&s;cre|tion to appoint an unlimited number, or that he can now appoint more than the number limited by law: yet, if the Con&s;titution, in the ca&s;e of judges, gave the power contend|ed for, in the ca&s;e of mini&s;ters, the law limiting the number of judges would be uncon&s;titutional; for Congre&s;s cannot
<PB N="6" REF="033268_0008_0FF6B219206D8768">dive&s;t the Pre&s;ident of any of his con&s;titutional power.&mdash; "Still" &s;ays he, "it is not my intention to lay any &s;tre&s;s on this argument; a di&s;crimination may be drawn between the offices, and a different con&s;truction has prevailed;&mdash; and it is not nece&s;&s;ary to prove the con&s;titutionality of our doctrine."</P>
<P>Nothing contributes more to error in rea&s;oning, than ambiguity of words, and the u&s;e of words, now in one &s;en&s;e, now in another, or applying different words to the &s;ame thing. By this u&s;e of language, any fal&s;ehood may be made to appear like truth. I am mi&s;taken if the &s;peech be not throughout a remarkable in&s;tance of this. It is &s;tated in the above rea&s;oning, that the office of a mini&s;ter, or that of a judge of the &s;upreme court, is not created by the Con&s;titution; that the office of a mini&s;ter, to any fo|reign court, where we have not had any before, is crea|ted by the Pre&s;ident making the appointment; and that the office of a judge of the &s;upreme court, is created by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Why, but to bewilder the judgement, the words, "where we have not had any before," were added, unle&s;s it be meant to confound office with officer, I do not &s;ee. The appointment of a mini&s;ter to a court, where we have not had any before, will, by this rea&s;oning, be creating an of|fice; but, if it were to a court, where there ever was a mini&s;ter before, it would not be creating an office; that is multiplying officers is creating offices. On the &s;ame principle, increa&s;ing the number of judges of the &s;upreme court, is making new offices; it would look too ab&s;urd to &s;ay it was making a new judiciary, or a new &s;upreme court; yet, the office and the authority is the &s;ame thing, and officer and the per&s;on who executes the authority is the &s;ame thing, but the per&s;on and the authority is not the
<PB N="7" REF="033268_0009_0FF6B21AD6E242D8">&s;ame thing. The office exi&s;ts, when there is no officer, as in the interval between the death, re&s;ignation, or di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion of a &s;ole officer, and the appointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or: the office is then &s;aid to be vacant, not to cea&s;e. The powers of a &s;ole officer may be exerci&s;ed only occa&s;ionally, as the office of lord high-con&s;table, or lord high-&s;tew|ard of England, or a dictator in Rome; in the intervals between their exerci&s;e, the office is not aboli&s;hed, but &s;u&s;|pended; and the next appointment is not the creation of an office, but of an officer. The &s;ame may be the ca&s;e with offices, who&s;e powers are exerci&s;ed not by one, but by &s;everal; and adding to the number is not multiplying offices, but officers. This is the ca&s;e of the office of fo|reign intercour&s;e, of agency, or commi&s;&s;ion to &s;erve the United States in foreign parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">U. S. L. <HI>175.</HI></NOTE>. The foreign intercour&s;e, the Pre&s;ident's agency or commi&s;&s;ion in foreign parts, is the office; the mini&s;ters are the officers; and the appoint|ment of one or more, as occa&s;ion requires, is not the cre|ation of an office, but of officers. The con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania authori&s;es the Governor, to appoint a com|petent number of ju&s;tices of the peace, in each di&s;trict; if, where there is but one, he &s;hould add another, is this creating a new office, or only a new officer?</P>
<P>Before the Con&s;titution or any law of the United States exi&s;ted, there were mini&s;ters, and there were judges.&mdash; There are many offices, as judges, &s;heriffs, coroners, ju&s;|tices of the peace, and con&s;tables, who&s;e authority is not &s;pecially defined, only by a written Con&s;titution or Law, but al&s;o by cu&s;toms and e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions. When it is intended by a Con&s;titution or a Law, to adopt any of the&s;e offices, the Con&s;titution or Law does not go back to all the
<PB N="8" REF="033268_0010_0FF6B21D9CA81AF8">previous e&s;tabli&s;hed definitions or limitations of authority, but conceiving them to exi&s;t, unle&s;s re&s;trained, modifies them to the &s;ituation of the country or the principles of the government. In all nations, there is a legi&s;lative authority, a judicial authority, an executive authority, and an authority of foreign intercour&s;e. The&s;e offices re&s;ult|ing from their internal and relative circum&s;tances, are created in each, whenever the nation takes its &s;overeign rank; and are exerci&s;ed according to the &s;everal modi|fications of their government. While the&s;e &s;tates were in a &s;ubordinate condition, they had not office or authori|ty of foreign intercour&s;e, they had no right to foreign in|tercour&s;e, for they were not &s;overeign &s;tates. The De|claration of Independence, by &s;eparating the United States from Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing them as a nation, created in the United States the office of foreign inter|cour&s;e. The Confederation declared Congre&s;s the organ of this foreign intercour&s;e. The Con&s;titution changed this modification, and declared the Pre&s;ident the organ of the United States in their foreign intercour&s;e; and, from this declaration of the Con&s;titution, the management of foreign intercour&s;e became a part of the Pre&s;ident's con|&s;titutional authority. From the exerci&s;e of this authority and all agency in it, Congre&s;s was excluded; and mini&s;ters to foreign nations were no longer the agents of Con|gre&s;s, but of the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution was a new modification of the govern|ment of the Union; and a federal judiciary, acting upon individuals, was a new power introduced into it. What|ever was given to it, was taken from the &s;tate judiciary. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary "to fix its juri&s;diction," to define what part of the &s;tate judiciary was taken, and ve&s;t|ed in the federal judiciary. The Con&s;titution only e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="9" REF="033268_0011_0FF6B21FD66F1678">a &s;upreme court,&mdash;and a power in Congre&s;s to e&s;tabli&s;h inferior courts, and limited the extent of federal judiciary, which Congre&s;s could take from the &s;upreme court, and ve&s;t in the inferior courts. This la&s;t was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, le&s;t Congre&s;s, in the organization of inferior courts, &s;hould affect that part of juri&s;diction, which is attached to the Pre&s;ident, foreign intercour&s;e. The con&s;titution therefore excludes the inferior courts to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Congre&s;s from all juri&s;diction "affecting amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Art. iii. Sect. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>." The fir&s;t limita|tion was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent any federal court from in|croaching on the &s;tate judiciary.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e rea&s;ons, and no rea&s;on exi&s;ted, to in|duce the framers of the con&s;titution, to define the limits of foreign intercour&s;e. It was not a new principle, in the government of the union, for it exi&s;ted under the confe|deration. It could not incroach on any &s;tate juri&s;diction, for no &s;tate ever had it. It re&s;ulted from the nature of the ca&s;e, and exi&s;ted immediately after the declaration of In|dependence made the thirteen &s;tates, as to all others, one nation.</P>
<P>I will go farther and &s;ay, that the framers of the Con&s;ti|tution could not define or limit it. For it re&s;ted on prin|ciples over which the United States had no control; but in concurrence with other nations. The Con&s;titution could dictate the relations of one &s;tate to another, but it could not dictate the relations of the United States with other nations. Tho&s;e relations are defined by a power paramount, the law of nations&mdash;the con&s;titution of the civilized world. This law of nations is to the Con&s;titution of any nation, as the Con&s;titution of the United States, to
<PB N="10" REF="033268_0012_0FF6B29F4A484B30">the Con&s;titution of any &s;tate of America. This law, therefore, cannot be altered by the act of any one nation, without the concurrence of the others. The Con&s;titution, therefore, is not &s;o ab&s;urd as to meddle with fixing its juri&s;diction, and contents it&s;elf with e&s;tabli&s;hing its organ. In&s;tead of the Congre&s;s of the Confederation, the Con&s;ti|tution e&s;tabli&s;hes the Pre&s;ident, re&s;trained only by the Senate, as its organ of foreign intercour&s;e, and to him, &s;o re&s;trained, leaves all the authority on this &s;ubject, which the Congre&s;s of the Confederation had, or the law of nati|ons gives to the organ of foreign intercour&s;e in any other nation. Part of this the law of nations e&s;tabli&s;hes to be, a power to &s;end mini&s;ters of different grades according to the importance of the &s;ubject or the parties. The com|pen&s;ation to the&s;e grades mu&s;t be determined, by what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the views of the law of nations. And if any other branch of the federal government, in which the power of compen&s;ation is ve&s;ted, in whole or in part, &s;o far exerci&s;e this power, as to defeat the lawful di&s;cretion of the organ of foreign intercour&s;e, that branch u&s;urps a power not given it by the Con&s;titution, exerci&s;es the pow|er, or, which is the fame thing, re&s;trains the exerci&s;e of the power, of the organ of foreign intercour&s;e, and violates not only the Con&s;titution of the United States, but the Con&s;titution of the great Confederation of the civilized world.</P>
<P>How far a law was nece&s;&s;ary, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Supreme Court, may not be nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I have &s;tated that, though the office of a judiciary had exi&s;ted in all &s;tates, a judiciary in the federal government over individuals was (let me adopt the word) "created" by the Con&s;titution. That a law was nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>create</HI> a
<PB N="11" REF="033268_0013_0FF6B221A52CF7C0">Supreme court, cannot be inferred from the words of the Con&s;titution, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall appoint "Judges of the Supreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e appointments are not herein otherwi&s;e pro|vided for, and <HI>which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">U. S. Con&s;t. Art. <HI>2,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>;" for the&s;e words expre&s;sly refer to other officers, than judges of the &s;upreme court; nor from the words "The judicial power of the United States &s;hall be ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as the <HI>Congre&s;s may from time to time ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. <HI>3,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>;" for the&s;e words ex|pre&s;sly refer to other courts, than the &s;upreme court.</P>
<P>That where the Con&s;titution does not, as in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;ident and the two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, minutely de&s;cribe the organization, a law is nece&s;&s;ary to organize, is an idea more favoured by many than by me. Suppo&s;e now, (&s;ince much of the oppo&s;ition argument re&s;ts on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the Pre&s;ident acting extravagantly and ab|&s;urdly) that Congre&s;s had acted &s;o extravagantly and ab&s;urdly, as not to have organized a &s;upreme court; and &s;uppo&s;e that I were to contend for more than was contended for in the debate on the foreign intercour&s;e bill; and to a&s;&s;ert that the Pre&s;ident could, without a law, have ap|pointed &s;uch a number of judges of the &s;upreme court, as in his di&s;cretion were competent for the duties pre&s;cribed by the Con&s;titution; I wi&s;h to know by what arguments from the Con&s;titution my a&s;&s;ertion could be oppo&s;ed. I &s;hould have on my &s;ide, the con&s;titutional authority, as &s;tated in the Speech, "that there <HI>&s;hall</HI> be a &s;upreme court" with a juri&s;diction fixed by the Con&s;titution; and the con&s;titutional authority of the Pre&s;ident to "appoint judges of the &s;upreme court." I might be an&s;wered, that Con|gre&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="033268_0014_0FF6B2A178286378">would furni&s;h no &s;alary. I would reply that Congre&s;s will not a&s;&s;i&s;t, but they will defeat a con&s;titutional autho|rity.</P>
<P>That when Congre&s;s organized the court, and fixed the number of judges, the Pre&s;ident in the exerci&s;e of his con|&s;titutional authority of appointment, &s;hould not exceed that number, is con&s;titutional and proper, for their num|ber is properly a matter of internal legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>But "not to lay any &s;tre&s;s on this argument;" for really the que&s;tion is not, how the office of foreign intercour&s;e was created, but to who&s;e management the Con&s;titution has committed it; I will &s;tate what I conceive to be the true limits of the con&s;titutional authority.&mdash;To Congre&s;s the Con&s;titution has committed the management of internal relations; to the Pre&s;ident, checked only by the Senate, the management of external relations. The Pre&s;ident, &s;o checked, is the con&s;titutional organ of all intercour&s;e be|tween this and foreign nations. Congre&s;s, checked only by the qualified negative of the Pre&s;ident, is the organ of all federal authority operating only on our&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of foreign intercour&s;e, the Pre&s;ident, checked only by the Senate, has <HI>all</HI> legi&s;lative powers, and Congre&s;s has only executive authority. Congre&s;s has power in its de&s;cretion to make &s;uch laws, e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch offices, and appropriate &s;uch &s;alaries for their &s;upport, as our internal circum&s;tances require; and the Pre&s;ident is po&s;itively <HI>bound</HI> to execute them, and appoint &s;uitable of|ficers. The Pre&s;ident has power in his di&s;cretion to make &s;uch treaties, and appoint mini&s;ters of &s;uch grades, as our circum&s;tances relative to foreign nations require; and Con|gre&s;s is po&s;itively <HI>bound</HI> to make &s;uitable provi&s;ions and ap|propriations for &s;alaries, &amp;c.

<PB N="13" REF="033268_0015_0FF6B2A42BEC9930">the Con&s;titution to each, their is a failure in duty, and the Con&s;titution is violated:&mdash;And the Pre&s;ident would not act more uncon&s;titutionally and ab&s;urdly, in refu&s;ing to appoint officers, or in appointing incompetent officers; than Congre&s;s, in refu&s;ing to appropriate &s;alaries, or in appropriating incompetent &s;alaries.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould not the Con&s;titution &s;o di&s;tribute the le|gi&s;lative authority, according to the &s;ubjects on which it is to operate? Is not the Con&s;titution the expre&s;&s;ion of the will of the people? Is not the Pre&s;ident the repre&s;en|tative of the people. And if <HI>&s;afety</HI> require, that the pow|er of making <HI>laws</HI> over only our&s;elves &s;hould be given to <HI>many;</HI> may not <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> require, that the power of making <HI>contracts,</HI> the management of all agency with other nations, be given to <HI>one?</HI> What chance is there, that the be&s;t knowledge of our true intere&s;ts &s;hould be found in a ma|jority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, rather than in the Pre&s;ident? What nation would treat with us, if the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were part of the organ of fo|reign intercour&s;e? The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, with all its popular pa&s;&s;ions, would &s;pend more time and money in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any foreign tran&s;action, and with a re&s;ult le&s;s wi&s;e, than the Pre&s;ident with all his agents, in con|ducting and concluding it. I know not what others may think, and my opinion may be wrong, but I think, that communications of our proceedings, in our foreign inter|cour&s;e, have been too freely made, and have opened di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions and excited pa&s;&s;ions, which have little favoured our peace and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>I know, and could an&s;wer, what may be &s;aid of other nations. No nation is like ours: and I re&s;t on con&s;titutional prin|ciples. The Con&s;titution is the &s;tandard by which this que&s;tion mu&s;t be tried, and to it, therefore, mu&s;t we appeal.</P>

I &s;ay, therefore, that the Con&s;titution has ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident, checked only by the Senate, the &s;ole manage|ment of foreign intercour&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let me, to avoid frequent repetitions, once for all ob&s;erve, that when I &s;ay this authority is ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident, I al|ways mean the Pre&s;ident checked, as the Con&s;titution directs, by the Senate.</NOTE>; and, I &s;upport this opinion by the words of the Con&s;titution. "The Pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Se|nators pre&s;ent concur; and he &s;hall nominate, and, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls; he &s;hall receive amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters. All trea|ties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. <HI>2.</HI> Sect. <HI>2, 3.</HI>&mdash;Art. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE>." The Con&s;titution having e&s;tabli&s;hed an organ of foreign intercour&s;e, and declared the efficacy of its acts, it was not nece&s;&s;ary nor proper, that it &s;hould go farther; the law of nations, a Con&s;titution paramount, would regulate the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, al&s;o, that it is a general rule, that wherever, in the con&s;titutional exerci&s;e of this authority, of managing the intercour&s;e of the United States with foreign nations, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for the Pre&s;ident to call on Congre&s;s for money, they are bound to grant &s;uch a &s;um, as is ade|quate to the purpo&s;es, which he, in &s;uch exerci&s;e of his authority, thinks proper to adopt and execute. And I further &s;ay, that it is a general rule, that no department of the government can execute or defeat the con&s;titutional acts of another; and that, when any department has con|&s;titutionally concluded an act, and the exerci&s;e of the
<PB N="15" REF="033268_0017_0FF6B2A65F579AF8">authority of any other department is nece&s;&s;ary for its execution, every other department is bound to exert its law|ful authority, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for a competent execu|tion of the act; and has no di&s;cretion to refu&s;e &s;uch exertion of its authority. I &s;upport this opinion on the principles of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;overeignty of the United States is not ve&s;ted in one man, or in one body of men; to be exerci&s;ed by that man or that body, or by the agents appointed and remove|able by either. The whole &s;overeignty is broken into portions or &s;hares, and each portion or &s;hare is ve&s;ted in a certain department; that each department exerci&s;ing the whole of its own &s;hare of the &s;overeignty, and no department exerci&s;ing any of the &s;hare of any other, the &s;everal departments may mutually check each other, and no department may engro&s;s the whole &s;overeignty.&mdash; Thus we have a legi&s;lative department, a judicial de|partment, an executive department. There is no &s;upe|riority or control in any of tho&s;e departments or &s;hares of &s;overeignty, over the other; though one may appoint, and another pay, a third; all are equal and uncontrolled within the limits of their power. The executive may pardon or remit a &s;entence of the judiciary, for that is within its &s;hare of &s;overeignty; but it has no power to re&s;train the judges from pa&s;&s;ing a &s;imilar &s;entence, when they next pa&s;s &s;entence on a &s;imilar offence. The legi&s;|lature may alter a law, for that is within its &s;hare of &s;overeignty, but it has no power without altering the law, to direct the judges to alter their con&s;truction of it. When the legi&s;lature has enacted a law, it cannot al&s;o con&s;true it, or judge of any man's conduct or rights by it; but mu&s;t leave that authority to the judiciary. When the judges have con&s;trued a law, or judged of any man's con|duct
<PB N="16" REF="033268_0018_0FF6B2260477B510">or rights by it, they cannot execute their judgement; but leave that authority to the executive. The executive cannot exerci&s;e any of the powers given to the legi&s;lature or to the judiciary; the judiciary cannot exerci&s;e any of the powers given to the executive or to the legi&s;lature; and the legi&s;lature cannot exerci&s;e any of the powers given to the executive or to the judiciary; except in &s;o far as the Con&s;titution may tru&s;t either with a portion of anothers power, and then it becomes in that re&s;pect a part of that other. Thus the departments mutually check each other, and (while none can encroach on the authority of another) mutually re&s;train each other from engro&s;&s;ing the whole of the &s;overeignty, and exerci&s;ing arbitrary power. And all the departments are checked by the Con&s;titution, and by the removing power of the elective branch. If the legi&s;lature or the executive exceed their &s;everal juri&s;diction, the judi|ciary will declare the act void. If the judiciary exceed its juri&s;diction, the executive may refu&s;e its execution. Be|&s;ides the&s;e checks of each department over the others, each department has checks within it&s;elf, over the exerci&s;e of its own power, to prevent its acts from being ra&s;hly con|clu&s;ive. Thus the Con&s;titution of the United States gives the legi&s;lative power to a Congre&s;s, compo&s;ed of a Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and directs, that no bill or re&s;olution &s;hall be con&s;idered as an act of the legi&s;|lature, unle&s;s it have obtained the a&s;&s;ent of both Hou&s;es, and al&s;o of the Pre&s;ident; or, if he refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent, it mu&s;t again pa&s;s through both Hou&s;es with the a&s;&s;ent of two-thirds of each. Until it be pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;olemn manner, it is not an act of the department.</P>
<P>The judicial power is ve&s;ted in a &s;upreme court, e&s;tab|li&s;hed by the Con&s;titution, and circuit and di&s;trict courts e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. The judiciary department has its
<PB N="17" REF="033268_0019_0FF6B22AC4D98808">checks in courts and juries; courts determining law, ju|ries determining facts. Courts cannot determine law, till juries have determined facts; and the verdict of a jury is of no avail, without the judgment of the court. Thus courts and juries mutually check each other, and the &s;u|perior courts check the inferior. The judgment of any court, acquie&s;ced in, is an act of the department; if carri|ed to a &s;uperior court it becomes not an act of the depart|ment, till the judgment of the &s;upreme court is given, or till a judgment of an inferior court is acquie&s;ced in.</P>
<P>The executive power is ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es, in the Pre&s;ident and the Senate. In tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the concurrence of the Senate is nece&s;&s;ary, the act of the Pre&s;ident only is not an act of the department, till it acquires the &s;anction of the Senate. The concur|ring &s;anction of both makes an act of the department.</P>
<P>To this department is intru&s;ted the management of fo|reign intercour&s;e; but, as it is variou&s;ly modified, I &s;hall take the liberty to make a &s;ubdivi&s;ion of this department, under the name of <HI>the department of foreign intercour&s;e.</HI>&mdash; The management of this department of foreign intercour&s;e is intru&s;ted to the Pre&s;ident. All who are employed in it, on the part of the United States, are his agents. He ge|nerally, but without any law to direct him, u&s;es the agency of the Secretary of &s;tate, in his corre&s;pondence with fo|reign mini&s;ters here, or our mini&s;ters abroad: and all our mini&s;ters abroad are his agents. He may receive amba&s;|&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters from foreign &s;tates. But he cannot appoint any amba&s;&s;ador, other public mini&s;ter, or con&s;ul, of the United States, without the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate. And he cannot, even by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, make a treaty, unle&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="033268_0020_0FF6B22CF3AA0748">two-thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">U. S. Con&s;t. Art. <HI>2,</HI> Sect. <HI>2, 3.</HI></NOTE>. The&s;e are the con&s;titutional checks within it&s;elf, on the department of foreign intercour&s;e. The Pre&s;ident may, by his own act, receive a mini&s;ter from a foreign court, but he cannot appoint a mini&s;ter to a foreign court, without the con&s;ent of the Senate; nor make a treaty, though he have the con&s;ent of a majority, without the con&s;ent of two-thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent. In determining therefore, what is an act of the department of foreign intercour&s;e, we mu&s;t con&s;ider what is the &s;ubject of the act. If it be the re|ceiving of an amba&s;&s;ador, it is an act of the department, on the reception by the Pre&s;ident. If it be the appoint|ing of an amba&s;&s;ador, other public mini&s;ter, or con&s;ul, it is an act of the department, on the appointment of the Pre&s;i|dent, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate. If it be the making of a treaty, it is an act of the department, on the ratification by the Pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concur.</P>
<P>Such then are the checks provided by our Con&s;titution; a power of &s;ome other department to prevent any act of any department from exceeding its con&s;titutional juri&s;dic|tion; and a power within every department to prevent any of it acts from being ra&s;hly conclu&s;ive on any other department. Thus the whole &s;overeignty is exerci&s;ed by all; but the whole &s;overeignty is not exerci&s;ed by any; and &s;o an arbitrary power is effectually prevented: pro|vided the Con&s;titution be equally re&s;pected by all, or the removing power of the elective department be faithfully exerted. The authority intru&s;ted by the Con&s;titution, to one department, mu&s;t not be influenced, directed, con|trolled,
<PB N="19" REF="033268_0021_0FF6B22F2879D4E8">or defeated by any other; or there will be an u&s;urpation of power, and the con&s;titutional authority will not be exerci&s;ed by the department, to which the Con&s;ti|tution intru&s;ts it, but by it and &s;ome other, or by &s;ome other only, or by it under the control of &s;ome other.</P>
<P>The check provided by our Con&s;titution is not a pow|er of any one department, to exerci&s;e any of the powers of another, or to re&s;train another in the execution of its powers, or to defeat their execution. One branch of a department may prevent the concluding of its own act; but one department cannot prevent or defeat the act of another. No department can either interrupt the pro|ceedings of another to a con&s;titutional act of this other de|partment, nor, after this other department has concluded its act, defeat its execution, by refu&s;ing the exertion of con&s;titutional power nece&s;&s;ary for its execution.</P>
<P>What was the intention of the Con&s;titution in di&s;tri|buting the &s;overeignty into portions or departments?&mdash; Was it that each or any &s;hould have a communication with the others or any of them? Surely not: for then no &s;eparation would have been made, and all the &s;overeignty would have been left in one body, and thus an arbitrary power given to it. To prevent an arbitrary power the &s;eparation was made, and the communication mu&s;t lead to an arbitrary power; to pro&s;trate fir&s;t one department, and then another, under the feet of the department acquir|ing a communication of the powers of any other. The idea of communication is incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea of &s;e|paration; &s;eparation is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent arbitrary pow|er; communication tends to make the will of one depart|ment defeat that of all the others; and di&s;cretion in one, with communication with the others, is but another word for arbitrary power.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="033268_0022_0FF6B231E2FC96B8">
While the proper department was proceeding to its act, could any other have re&s;trained the exertion of its con&s;ti|tutional powers? Can Congre&s;s make a law, that the &s;upreme court &s;hall not give judgment in an action de|pending therein? If any one department cannot prevent another to complete its act, after the act is complete, can it defeat it? All departments are the agents of the Con|&s;titution; and the Con&s;titution, which authorizes the act, certainly requires its execution; and its intru&s;ting the di|rection to one, and the execution to another agent, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been intended, that the powers be &s;et again&s;t each other, and &s;o nothing be done. Does not the prohibition to prevent the act, nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ume a prohibition to defeat its execution? Can it be a con&s;ti|tutional act, and yet an act not to be executed? Can the check of the one on the other, without this pre&s;umption, be effectual? Without this, will not the department in|tru&s;ted with the act, po&s;&s;e&s;s merely a &s;hadow without a &s;ub&s;tance, and be like tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who &s;uppo&s;e there is nothing in nature but ideas; and wor&s;e than they, as wanting power even in imagination?</P>
<P>I may be told, that there is a department, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es power to defeat the act of another: for the Pre&s;ident may, by a pardon, defeat the judgment of a criminal court. This power is expre&s;sly given by the Con&s;titution. In England, the court of chancery can defeat the judgment of a civil court. The court of chancery is part of the judiciary department. There and here the &s;upreme exe|cutive can, by pardon, defeat the judgment of a criminal court. I con&s;ider the power of pardon, in criminal ca&s;es, as analogous to the chancery power in civil ca&s;es; a power to mitigate the rigour of the law, and give relief, where law could not relieve. In this re&s;pect, I con&s;ider the execu|tive
<PB N="21" REF="033268_0023_0FF6B25BEC7AD740">as acting in a judicial capacity, and concluding the act of that department. And I con&s;ider his di&s;cretion as a judicial di&s;cretion, and like the court of chancery, bound by rules drawn from experience, in the exerci&s;e of this di&s;creti|on. As this idea has not perhaps been &s;ufficiently attended to, I will not undertake to lay down rules for the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cretionary power of pardoning. But &s;omething like this may be &s;ugge&s;ted: that this power ought not to be exerted, where, according to the rules of law, a jury could have acquitted, or a court have di&s;charged; but it may be exerted, where greater mi&s;chief may accure to the com|munity from the execution, than from the pardon of the judgment. Such exerci&s;e of di&s;cretion will not interfere with the con&s;titutional power of the ordinary judiciary; for it is bound by rules, and cannot regard con&s;equences. <HI>Fiat ju&s;titia ruat caelum.</HI></P>
<P>My idea of true di&s;cretion is this: where the Con&s;titu|tion, or where a con&s;titutional act of any other depart|ment does not interfere, every department has a di&s;cretion to proceed or not to proceed, in a particular exertion of its authority. But where the Con&s;titution, or a con&s;titu|tional act of any department, requires an exertion of the authority of any other department, this other department has no di&s;cretion to proceed, or not to proceed, to the ne|ce&s;&s;ary exertion; has no authority to examine, whether the department who&s;e act requires its exertion, has exerci&s;ed its con&s;titutional di&s;cretion right or not. Every act legally concluded by any department, mu&s;t, by every other de|partment, be con&s;idered as <HI>rightly</HI> concluded; and, like a mathematical maxim, be received without proof. And in this ca&s;e, it is not one department that abridges the power of another; but as Mr. G. &s;ays, 'it is the Con&s;titution,
<PB N="22" REF="033268_0024_0FF6B233CDA9D168">which abridges the powers of both:"&mdash;The fir&s;t cannot proceed&mdash;the other cannot look back.</P>
<P>Such are my ideas of the uncontrolled power of the de|partments, their mutual checks, and their &s;everal di&s;cre|tion. And I hope it will appear to every candid, intelli|gent and attentive reader, that this doctrine "will &s;tand the te&s;t of inve&s;tigation, and leads to no palpable ab&s;ur|dity;" and, &s;o far from being "novel," will to every reader who has &s;tudied the principles and modification of the Con&s;titution of the United States, appear familiar and ju&s;t; and as old as the Con&s;titution it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to examine the rea&s;oning of Mr. G. on the&s;e principles; and I hope I &s;hall &s;hew, that it is founded on a mi&s;application of words, and a mi&s;con&s;truc|tion of principles.</P>
<P>He founds his rea&s;oning on this po&s;ition;&mdash;"The Con|&s;titution has expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted, in Congre&s;s, the power of rai&s;ing, granting, and directing the applica|tion of money." For this he &s;tates his authority in the Con&s;titution. "The 8th &s;ection of the fir&s;t article de|clares, that Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to levy and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, and to borrow money on the credit of the United States. The 1&s;t &s;ection em|phatically &s;tates, that <HI>all legi&s;lative powers</HI> herein granted &s;hall be ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s; and the 9th &s;ection provides, that no money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury, but in con&s;equence of <HI>appropriations made by law.</HI>"</P>
<P>From his po&s;ition &s;o &s;upported, he draws this conclu&s;ion, "that Congre&s;s are judges of the propriety or impropri|ety of making a grant, and have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cretion therein."</P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve that his po&s;ition is not &s;tated in the words of the Con&s;titution; and it is no uncommon thing,
<PB N="23" REF="033268_0025_0FF6B272B1C55158">by changing the words of the Con&s;titution, into words conveying the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and &s;omething more, to draw from them a conclu&s;ion which the words of the Con&s;titu|tion do not warrant. For in&s;tance, the 7th &s;ection of the 1&s;t article of the Con&s;titution &s;ays, that "All bills for rai&s;ing a revenue &s;hall originate in the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives." One would think in rea&s;oning on this &s;ecti|on, there would be no harm in &s;ub&s;tituting the words <HI>money bills,</HI> in&s;tead of the words <HI>bills for rai&s;ing a revenue.</HI> But be&s;ides <HI>bills for rai&s;ing a revenue,</HI> there are <HI>appropria|tion bills,</HI> which are bills fixing a &s;um of money, and declaring an object to which it &s;hall be applied, and a fund from which it &s;hall be drawn. The&s;e may al&s;o be called <HI>money bills.</HI> Now by &s;ub&s;tituting, in the 7th &s;ection, the words <HI>money bills,</HI> in&s;tead of the words <HI>bills for rai&s;ing a revenue,</HI> the &s;ection, &s;o read, will be con&s;idered as re&s;train|ing the Senate from originating an <HI>appropriation bill;</HI>&mdash; though the Con&s;titution re&s;trains the Senate only from originating <HI>bills for rai&s;ing a revenue.</HI> Yet an <HI>appropri|ation law</HI> may be made, without a <HI>law for rai&s;ing a reve|nue,</HI> or without occa&s;ioning any &s;uch law.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not di&s;pute, whether the words of his po&s;ition, <HI>rai&s;ing, granting, and directing the application of money,</HI> do not &s;ufficiently expre&s;s the powers of Congre&s;s, as &s;tated in his quotations from the Con&s;titution; but, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to di&s;pute, whether Mr. G. does not u&s;e them, to expre&s;s tho&s;e pow|ers, and &s;omething more, which the words of the Con|&s;titution neither expre&s;s nor imply.</P>
<P>Not content with the words of the Con&s;titution, "All le|gi&s;lative powers herein granted, &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a Con|gre&s;s;" Mr. G. &s;ays, that this is <HI>"emphatically"</HI> &s;tated. Perhaps he in&s;erted the word <HI>emphatically,</HI> thence to &s;upport
<PB N="24" REF="033268_0026_0FF6B274ECEA3EC8">his doctrine, by a conclu&s;ion, that the Con&s;titution gives no legi&s;lative power but to Congre&s;s, and excludes the depart|ment of foreign intercour&s;e from all legi&s;lative power.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution does not ve&s;t all legi&s;lative power in Congre&s;s; for it declares that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators pre|&s;ent concur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Art. <HI>2.</HI> Sect. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>; and it declares, that this Con&s;titution, and the laws of the United States which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof; and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land; and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the Con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been admitted that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives claims no agency in making treaties; and even Mr. G. has admitted, that where a treaty needs no law to carry it into effect, or is not contradicted by any previous law, no interference of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is nece&s;&s;ary; the Con&s;titution declares a treaty to be a law of the Uni|ted States; and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is an e&s;&s;en|tial part of Congre&s;s; there is therefore other legi&s;lative powers granted by the Con&s;titution, than tho&s;e ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In laying down his po&s;ition, having &s;ub&s;tituted words of his own, in&s;tead of the words of the Con&s;titution, on which only his argument mu&s;t re&s;t, he thus rea&s;ons from it. "We &s;ay, that Congre&s;s, having the &s;ole power of granting money, are judges of the propriety or impropri|ety of making a grant, that they have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cretion therein, and that the power of granting
<PB N="25" REF="033268_0027_0FF6B236878FE9C0">money, for any purpo&s;es whatever, belongs &s;olely to the legi&s;lature, in which it is <HI>literally</HI> ve&s;ted by the Con&s;titu|tion. The power of determining the amount of an ap|propriation is a legi&s;lative power, the power of doing what is within the province of law, the power of fixing the rule by which a certain act is to be executed. The Pe&s;ident may appoint as many mini&s;ters as he thinks fit, and if Congre&s;s, without having any right to exerci&s;e di&s;cretion, be bound to make provi&s;ion for them, the amount of mo|ney nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport, would al&s;o depend upon him; and the power of granting money, in that in&s;tance, would be transferred from the legi&s;lature to the executive, and al&s;o the power of rai&s;ing money; for it is immaterial to me, whether he does it directly, or whether the legi&s;la|ture are bound to do it, according to his di&s;cretion."</P>
<P>In order to determine, whether his rea&s;oning be fair, and his conclu&s;ion ju&s;t, we mu&s;t examine the ju&s;tice of his po&s;ition, by comparing it with the &s;ections of the Con&s;ti|tution, by which he &s;upports it. He &s;upports it by his quota|tions from the 8th, the 1&s;t, and the 9th &s;ections, of the 1&s;t article of the Con&s;titution. Taking it for granted (and I believe it is true) that the&s;e quotations are the only parts of the Con&s;titution, on which he could found his rea&s;on|ing to draw his conclu&s;ion; if his po&s;ition, taking the words of it in the &s;en&s;e which his rea&s;oning puts on them, be not &s;upported by his quotations from the Con&s;titution; his rea&s;oning, and his conclu&s;ion mu&s;t fall to the ground.</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming that he &s;upports his power of rai&s;ing money, by the 8th &s;ection; his power of granting, and directing the application of money, by the 9th; and the exclu&s;ive ve&s;ting of the&s;e powers in Congre&s;s, by the 1&s;t; I &s;hall take the liberty to &s;ub&s;titute in his po&s;ition, the words of the Con&s;titution, in&s;tead of his words. The po&s;ition and
<PB N="26" REF="033268_0028_0FF6B238344C3AB8">conclu&s;ion will then &s;tand thus:&mdash;<HI>All legi&s;lative powers herein granted &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a Congre&s;s; Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and ex|ci&s;es, and to borrow money, on the credit of the United States; and no money &s;hall be drawn from the Trea&s;ury, but in con|&s;equence of appropriations made by law; therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Congre&s;s are judges of the propriety or impropriety of mak|ing a grant, and have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cretion therein.</HI>&mdash;STRANGE LOGIC!</P>
<P>In his &s;hort quotation from the 8th &s;ection, he has omit|ted &s;ome words, immediately after the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, and before the power to borrow money. I &s;hall re&s;tore them to their place. "Congre&s;s &s;hall have power</P>
<P>"To lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States:&mdash;</P>
<P>"To borrow money, on the credit of the United States."</P>
<P>From the manner in which this part (and the whole) of this &s;ection is printed, I con&s;ider the word <HI>to</HI> before the words <HI>pay the debts,</HI> as &s;ynonymous with the words <HI>in or|der to,</HI> and the clau&s;es omitted by Mr. G. not as giving two new powers, but as pointing out the objects to which the money rai&s;ed by taxes, &amp;c. &s;hall be applied. So that Congre&s;s takes this power of rai&s;ing money, coupled with the duty of applying it to the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve al&s;o, that this &s;ection which defines the powers of Congre&s;s, gives to it a power "To make all laws, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper, for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers, ve&s;ted, by this Con&s;titution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." I &s;ay that Congre&s;s takes all its powers, coupled with the
<PB N="27" REF="033268_0029_0FF6B27722950318">duty of applying them to the purpo&s;es, for which they were given by the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That the Con&s;titution determines, that Congre&s;s has the exclu&s;ive "power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im|po&s;ts, and exci&s;es, and to borrow money"; and that "no money &s;hall be drawn from the Trea&s;ury, but in con&s;e|quence of appropriations made by law," <HI>and by a law made by Congre&s;s;</HI> I admit. But before Mr. G. can draw a conclu&s;ion, that Congre&s;s may, in every ca&s;e, determine, whether it be proper or improper, to lay taxes, or to ap|propriate money, he mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h &s;omething more: he mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h, from the Con&s;titution, that Congre&s;s has in every ca&s;e, a power to refu&s;e to lay taxes, or to appro|priate money. This he cannot e&s;tabli&s;h either from his quotations or any other part of the Con&s;titution: for it may be the duty of Congre&s;s to lay taxes, in order to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and gene|ral welfare of the United States.</P>
<P>Taking his po&s;ition in his own words, "the Con&s;titu|tion has expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, the power of rai&s;ing, granting, and directing the application of money;" before he can draw his conclu&s;ion, "that Congre&s;s are judges of the propriety or impropriety of making a grant, and have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cre|tion therein;" he mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h &s;omething more: he mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h, that in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, the man who has the &s;ole power of granting money has a power to refu&s;e. This he can|not e&s;tabli&s;h from any principles of rea&s;on; for a man may have the &s;ole power to do a thing coupled with an ab&s;o|lute obligation to do it; as the Pre&s;ident to appoint judges of the &s;upreme court; and the &s;upreme court to give judgment in a ca&s;e before it affecting an amba&s;&s;ador; or a man to pay his debt. Mr. G. therefore draws a conclu|&s;ion
<PB N="28" REF="033268_0030_0FF6B279E1C9D378">without the nece&s;&s;ary premi&s;es; and his conclu&s;ion has not foundation to re&s;t on, and mu&s;t fall to the ground,</P>
<P>If, by laying empha&s;is on the word <HI>all,</HI> he means to prove that <HI>no</HI> legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted in any other de|partment of government, except Congre&s;s, the ordinary legi&s;lature; I have &s;hown, that this is incon&s;i&s;tent with a fair con&s;truction of the Con&s;titution. To found any rea|&s;oning on one expre&s;&s;ion of any in&s;trument, when there are, in it, other expre&s;&s;ions, which would de&s;troy that rea&s;oning, is taking a contracted view, and making an unfair and imprudent u&s;e of that in&s;trument. The whole mu&s;t be taken together, and if there be any contradictory expre&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t if po&s;&s;ible be reconciled, by apply|ing them &s;everally to the re&s;pective objects in the contem|plation of its author.</P>
<P>If Mr. G. con&s;iders di&s;cretion, as &s;ynonymous with legi&s;lative power, and a&s;&s;erts, that in every ca&s;e, in which an act of the legi&s;lature is called for, they have a di&s;cretion to act or to refu&s;e, according to their di&s;cretion; his rea|&s;oning will &s;tand thus:&mdash;The power of rai&s;ing, granting, and directing the application of money, is a legi&s;lative power; but every legi&s;lative power is coupled with a di&s;|cretion in the legi&s;lature, to exerci&s;e or refu&s;e its power; therefore the legi&s;lature may, in every ca&s;e, refu&s;e to rai&s;e, grant, or direct the application of money. I have &s;aid in <HI>every</HI> ca&s;e, not only becau&s;e the di&s;cretion, which Mr. G. contends for, is co-exten&s;ive with the power, which ex|tends to <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es; but becau&s;e there are &s;ome ca&s;es, in which I admit the di&s;cretion to refu&s;e. And I have u&s;ed the words <HI>may refu&s;e to rai&s;e, grant,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;tead of his words, "Congre&s;s <HI>are judges of the propriety or impro|priety of the grant, and have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cretion therein;</HI> becau&s;e I admit, and therefore we both agree,
<PB N="29" REF="033268_0031_0FF6B27BAC0F6758">that Congre&s;s has a right to refu&s;e in &s;ome ca&s;es, and un|le&s;s the di&s;pute is &s;tated, as I have &s;tated it, there would be no di&s;pute; and becau&s;e a right to exerci&s;e <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> to grant, without a power to refu&s;e, is <HI>no</HI> right: there can be no di&s;cretion, where there is no power to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. G. admits, that where the Con&s;titution, as in the ca&s;e of &s;alaries to the Pre&s;ident, and the judges of the &s;u|preme court, declares, that Congre&s;s <HI>&s;hall</HI> grant; Con|gre&s;s is bound not to refu&s;e. But he &s;eems to hold this opinion, "that the di&s;cretionary power of the legi&s;lature, to grant money, is limited only by the Con&s;titution, and is not transferred to any other department;" and &s;tating that, "when the Con&s;titution means to impo&s;e a duty, it po&s;i|tively directs the act to be done," he &s;ays "we may &s;afely conclude, that where it gives no &s;uch direction, where it empowers, in&s;tead of commanding, the rea&s;on is, that it meant to leave a di&s;cretion."</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion he &s;eems to &s;upport, by di&s;tingui&s;hing between the word <HI>&s;hall,</HI> and the word <HI>may,</HI> and he &s;eems to con&s;ider this, as the di&s;tinction between legi&s;lative power, and executive power; con&s;idering legi&s;lative power as coupled with di&s;cretion, and executive power as coupled with obligation; and as the Con&s;titution, in &s;ome ca&s;es, po&s;itively directs, by the word <HI>&s;hall,</HI> there is no obligation on the legi&s;lature but in tho&s;e; and that, in all other ca&s;es where the Con&s;titution u&s;es the word <HI>may,</HI> or the words <HI>&s;hall have power,</HI> the legi&s;lature has di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>It is well e&s;tabli&s;hed and under&s;tood, that <HI>may</HI> is often con&s;trued <HI>&s;hall,</HI> and that <HI>&s;hall</HI> is often con&s;trued <HI>may.</HI> No man conver&s;ant in the legal con&s;truction of language, will require proof of this.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution declares, that "the Pre&s;ident <HI>&s;hall</HI> no|minate, and, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the
<PB N="30" REF="033268_0032_0FF6B27DE3A0BE28">Senate, <HI>&s;hall</HI> appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls;" the Pre&s;ident has never appointed an <HI>am|ba&s;&s;ador;</HI> will Mr. G. recommend an impeachment for this breach of duty? Or, if the Pre&s;ident &s;hould think proper to decline to appoint any public mini&s;ter, would Mr. G. recommend an impeachment? "The Pre&s;ident <HI>&s;hall</HI> re|ceive amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters:" if he have rea&s;on to reject, has he not di&s;cretion?" "The Pre&s;ident <HI>may,</HI> on extraordinary occa&s;ions, convene both hou&s;es, or either of them." Suppo&s;e an occa&s;ion requiring him to convene either or both hou&s;es, and he wilfully refu&s;e; is he not impeachable?</P>
<P>It appears then, that a po&s;itive duty may, without any expre&s;s command, be impo&s;ed by the nature of the ca&s;e. In many ca&s;es, the word <HI>may</HI> impo&s;es as &s;trong an obliga|tion as the word <HI>&s;hall,</HI> and the word <HI>&s;hall</HI> impo&s;es no &s;tronger obligation than the word <HI>may.</HI> The Con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania declares, "that the legi&s;lature <HI>&s;hall,</HI> as &s;oon as conveniently may be, provide by law, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools throughout the &s;tate." Do the words, <HI>as &s;oon as conveniently may be,</HI> weaken the obligation; or &s;uppo&s;e them &s;truck out, would the obligation be &s;trengthened? Or, is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools better provided for, by the word <HI>&s;hall,</HI> than if the Con&s;titution had u&s;ed the word <HI>may?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. G. admitting, that where the Con&s;titution declares, that Congre&s;s &s;hall grant money, there is no di&s;cretion to refu&s;e; ob&s;erves, that if "declares, that the Pre&s;ident and Judges &s;hall have &s;alaries, &amp;c. Had the framers of the Con&s;titution al&s;o intended, that Congre&s;s &s;hould be bound to make provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters, they would have intro|duced a &s;imilar clau&s;e in re&s;pect to them. The Con&s;titu|tion is explicit in one ca&s;e, and declares, that &s;alaries
<PB N="31" REF="033268_0033_0FF6B23A6ED67698">&s;hall be given: it is &s;ilent in the other, and does not de|clare, that &s;alaries &s;hall be given." He concludes, there|fore, that "the objection, that Congre&s;s cannot, in every ca&s;e, exerci&s;e the di&s;cretionary power to grant money, cannot reach farther than the &s;pecific ca&s;e on which it is grounded."</P>
<P>I will ob&s;erve, that the object of tho&s;e clau&s;es in the Con&s;titution, is not &s;o much to bind Congre&s;s to grant money, as to prevent them from altering their grant. Its object is, to make the executive and judiciary independent of the legi&s;lature, and to deprive Congre&s;s of a power of influencing tho&s;e departments to &s;uccumbency to the will of the legi&s;lature, and thereby of acquiring all power, and becoming arbitrary. This is evident, from the difference of expre&s;&s;ion in the two ca&s;es. The compen&s;ation of the Pre&s;ident "&s;hall neither be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed, dur|ing the period for which he &s;hall have been elected." The compen&s;ation of the judges "&s;hall not be dimini&s;hed dur|ing their continuance in office." The judges continuing in office during life, it is evident, that from the gradual &s;inking of the value of money, which accompanies the in|crea&s;e of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, there might, during his continuance in office, be a nece&s;&s;ity to increa&s;e the &s;alary of a Judge: therefore, it is only &s;aid, that the &s;alary of a Judge &s;hall not be dimini&s;hed. But the duration of the Pre&s;ident's authority being only four years, the nece&s;&s;ity is not &s;o great, as to induce the Con&s;titution, to &s;ubmit the Pre&s;ident to the influence of hope from the legi&s;lature. Therefore, his &s;alary can nei|ther be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed, during the period of his appointment. If Congre&s;s could dimini&s;h the &s;alary of the other departments, or, as the Penn&s;ylvania A&s;&s;embly, in the year 1796, did, in the ca&s;e of Judges, when there
<PB N="32" REF="033268_0034_0FF6B280C4D4D100">was a nece&s;&s;ity for an increa&s;e, limit the increa&s;e to a le&s;s time than their continuance in office; the Con&s;titution would be violated, the other departments would be influ|enced to a &s;uccumbency to the legi&s;lature, and a &s;eparation of power, the guard again&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, would be removed. The other departments would become the mere puppets of the legi&s;lature, and be reduced to that &s;tate of dependency, in which the Engli&s;h judges were, before continuance for life was attached to their office: for it is the &s;ame thing whether you take away the office, or take away the &s;alary, or make it incompetent.</P>
<P>It would have been extending but a little farther, the &s;ame principle of rea&s;oning, if Mr. G. had denied, that Congre&s;s is bound to grant money, even to the Pre&s;ident or Judges; for the Con&s;titution does not expre&s;sly &s;ay, that Congre&s;s &s;hall grant, but only that the Pre&s;ident and Judges &s;hall receive: and the obligation to grant is only implied. Had it been expre&s;&s;ed, Congre&s;s, without a &s;en&s;e of duty, could ea&s;ily have evaded the words, by making an incompetent grant, or e&s;tabli&s;hing it on incom|petent funds. The duty of granting ari&s;es out of the power to grant, and the obligation to promote the views of the Con&s;titution. The Con&s;titution lays down only the out lines of the government, and leaves to the depart|ments the power, with the obligation to fini&s;h the re&s;t.&mdash;The Con&s;titution does not de&s;cend to little matters. The Con&s;titution does not provide, that &s;alaries &s;hould be gi|ven to all the officers of the government. But &s;urely, if there be an officer nece&s;&s;ary for the regular operation of the Con&s;titution, and that officer cannot be obtained with|out a &s;alary, Congre&s;s are as much bound by the Con&s;ti|tution, to grant a &s;alary, as if the Con&s;titution expre&s;sly required it to be done.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="033268_0035_0FF6B28272E528D8">
Mr. G. will perhaps allow this, but contend that Con|gre&s;s is to judge of the nece&s;&s;ity, and that the power of acting is accompanied with the power of refu&s;ing. "Con|gre&s;s is, upon all occa&s;ions, under a moral obligation to act according to ju&s;tice and propriety. We do not claim the ab&s;urd privilege of acting without &s;ufficient motives, but we wi&s;h every proper motive to have its due weight. The opinion of the Executive, and where he has a partial power, the application of that power to a certain object, will ever operate as powerful motives upon our deliberations." Whe|ther it be to embarra&s;s the argument, or to give it a &s;peci|ous appearance, in the more harmle&s;s names of right of di&s;cretion, and giving every motive its due weight; he avoids expre&s;&s;ing the power to refu&s;e; though that be the only power really to be contended for. That Congre&s;s alone has the power to grant, is clear. A power to judge, without a power to refu&s;e, is nothing. And to contend for &s;uch power in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, with re|&s;pect to tran&s;actions of the other departments, is to con|tend for an idle and u&s;ele&s;s curio&s;ity into tran&s;actions, which they have no authority to conduct or control. To contend for that, and the power to refu&s;e, is to give the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives a compleat control over all the other branches, and ve&s;t all power in the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives. For, as Congre&s;s only can grant money, if, where money is nece&s;&s;ary to execute the mea&s;ures of the other departments, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives may judge of the propriety or impropriety of making a grant, and have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;cretion therein; though they may grant, if they approve, they may refu&s;e, if they di&s;like. If the acts of other departments are to be weighed as a motive, not re&s;pected as an obligation, there will ne|ver be wanting pretences for con&s;idering the motive as
<PB N="34" REF="033268_0036_0FF6B284B26DED68">light. They will never grant the money, unle&s;s they ap|prove the mea&s;ure. A right to judge of the propriety of the grant, is a right to judge of the propriety of the mea|&s;ure. And thus every department, to whom the Con&s;ti|tution has intru&s;ted the management of power, mu&s;t exer|ci&s;e it according to the will of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; that is, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives will have all power: all the barriers of &s;eparation will be removed, and the com|pleat &s;overeignty lodged in one hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;ay the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, becau&s;e though Mr. G. in making this claim for the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, affects to claim nothing more for them than for the Senate; yet, in fact, this claim increa&s;es only the power of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and adds nothing to the power of the Senate: for the Senate, as part of the department of foreign intercour&s;e, has already all control over the&s;e mea|&s;ures, which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this claim could give.</P>
<P>The doctrine which I would e&s;tabli&s;h, is, that all powers of Congre&s;s are coupled with an obligation to exerci&s;e them; that having a power to make all laws nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the powers of Congre&s;s, and all powers ve&s;ted by the Con&s;titution in the govern|ment of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof; Congre&s;s is <HI>bound</HI> to make all &s;uch laws; that in all other ca&s;es, Congre&s;s are judges of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of &s;uch law, and are bound to make it, only when they judge it nece&s;&s;ary or proper; but that, where a law is nece&s;&s;ary or proper, to carry into execution a con&s;titutional act of any other department, this other de|partment is the &s;ole judge of the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch law; and that, when this department declares the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch law, Congre&s;s is <HI>bound</HI> to pa&s;s it, and has no di&s;cretion, but in choo&s;ing the
<PB N="35" REF="033268_0037_0FF6B23CB4E15698">be&s;t law, to give effect to the act of the other department. That, where the Con&s;titution expre&s;sly requires a law, Congre&s;s has a di&s;cretion to refu&s;e, Mr. G. will not a&s;&s;ert. Every one knows, that an implied obligation impo&s;es a duty as &s;trong as an expre&s;s obligation; and, that, to ob&s;truct the authority derived from the Con&s;titution, is, in effect, to ob&s;truct the Con&s;titution it&s;elf; for the Con&s;ti|tution was made, for the purpo&s;e that its &s;everal autho|rities &s;hould be admini&s;tered by the departments, to which they were &s;everally intru&s;ted; and be carried into execu|tion by the &s;everal departments, to which the means were intru&s;ted. If the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, there|fore, refu&s;e to pa&s;s a law, which the con&s;titutional act of any department has rendered nece&s;&s;ary; the Con&s;titution is as effectually violated, as if they had refu&s;ed to pa&s;s a law, which the Con&s;titution it&s;elf declared to be nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Surely a claim which would defeat all the views of the Con&s;titution, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;eparation of power, a claim, &s;o ab&s;urd as to counteract the Con&s;titution, mu&s;t have very expre&s;s words indeed to &s;upport it. Mr. G. is &s;en&s;i|ble of this, and, without proving, a&s;&s;erts, "that it is evident that <HI>where</HI> the Con&s;titution has lodged the power, <HI>there</HI> exi&s;ts the right of acting and the right of di&s;cretion." But, to &s;upport his a&s;&s;ertion, he cannot appeal to any expre&s;s words of the Con&s;titution. There are none &s;uch. He mu&s;t re&s;t upon general principles of con&s;truction. But I have already ob&s;erved that general principles will not &s;upport his doctrine; for there may be power coupled with obligation, or power without any di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me, to dimini&s;h the force of the clau&s;e re&s;pecting appropriations, by con&s;idering it as a matter of form. It is &s;ub&s;tantial, that no money &s;hall be
<PB N="36" REF="033268_0038_0FF6B28761C74338">drawn from the trea&s;ury but in con&s;equence of a law. But this does not e&s;tabli&s;h, that Congre&s;s is free to refu&s;e to pa&s;s a law for that purpo&s;e; or has, in all ca&s;es, a right to enquire into the propriety of the mea&s;ures, which have oc|ca&s;ioned the nece&s;&s;ity for rai&s;ing money. The limitation, to two years, of appropriations for rai&s;ing armies, is not impo&s;ed as a re&s;traint of Congre&s;s over the Executive, but as a re&s;traint of one Congre&s;s over another. It may be ob&s;erved, from this clau&s;e, that the power of appropriating money gives a control over the &s;ubject; and, if this power be coupled with di&s;cretion in all ca&s;es, gives a control in all ca&s;es. If there be no limitation to the exerci&s;e of this di&s;cretion, but the judgment of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, as there is no power to control their judgment, they only will judge of the weight of their motives, and will always think they judge right; and there will be no limi|tation to the power of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. Thus all &s;eparation of power will be removed, and arbitrary power will be ve&s;ted in one branch of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Who gave the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives a right to &s;et it&s;elf up as the &s;ole organ of &s;overeignty, as the &s;ole judge of propriety; over its compeers in authority, "erecting it&s;elf into a high prie&s;t of the Con&s;titution, a&s;&s;uming the keys of political &s;alvation, and damning, without mercy, who&s;oever differs with it in opinion?" Is <HI>it</HI> any thing more than a fellow-&s;ervant with the other departments, like them, by the Con&s;titution, the lord of all, limited to its own portion of authority, and, by the Con&s;titution, bound to lend its a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them, whenever their con|&s;titutional authority calls for it; as much as each of them is bound towards it? Whenever a law is made, the ju|diciary is bound to carry into execution the view of the legi&s;lature; by lending their power to determine on it.&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="033268_0039_0FF6B23EE7B6CB38">They have no di&s;cretion whether they will do &s;o or not, for the Con&s;titution, by giving them the &s;ole power of determining, po&s;itively binds them to determine, and the only di&s;cretion left with them is the choo&s;ing of the be&s;t manner of determining, &s;o as be&s;t to accompli&s;h the views of the legi&s;lature. When the judiciary have given judg|ment, the executive has no di&s;cretion, whether it will lend its power to execute the judgment; for the Con&s;titution, by giving it the &s;ole power of executing judgments, has po&s;itively bound it to exert its power, for this purpo&s;e; and the only di&s;cretion left is the choice of the mo&s;t con|venient and lawful means for the execution. Whenever Congre&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hes an office, the Con&s;titution, by giving the Pre&s;ident the power of appointing, binds him to appoint a competent officer, and he has no di&s;cretion but to judge of the mo&s;t proper per&s;on. Whenever an act of any of the other departments requires a grant of money, in order to give it effect, the Con&s;titution, by giving Congre&s;s the &s;ole power of granting money, has po&s;itively bound it to grant a &s;um competent for the due execution of the act of the other department; and the only di&s;cretion left to it is a choice of the be&s;t means of rai&s;ing the money, or the be&s;t fund whence to draw it. Suppo&s;e a judgment again&s;t the United States in any of its courts for a &s;um of money; is not Congre&s;s bound by the duty ari&s;ing out of their power, to provide funds for the payment of this judgment; or can it enter on the judiciary province, and enquire into the merits of the judgment? Ju&s;t &s;o, in any act of any other department creating, on the &s;ubject committed to it, a nece&s;&s;ity for a grant of money, there ari&s;es, out of their power, a duty on Congre&s;s to make a competent grant. The competence of the grant is to be mea&s;ured by the nature of the act, the execution of which is to be provided
<PB N="38" REF="033268_0040_0FF6B241A073ADA0">for; and the means of rai&s;ing the money are to be direct|ed by the di&s;cretion of Congre&s;s; for the direction of the means of rai&s;ing money is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s. Whenever an act of another department interferes not, Congre&s;s may grant or refu&s;e, according to its di&s;cretion, re&s;trained only by the Con&s;titution: for the Con&s;titution ve&s;ts in Congre&s;s the re&s;idue of all powers of admini&s;tra|tion, not di&s;tributed to other departments; &s;ubject, like every department, to the duty of exerting its powers for promoting the views of the Con&s;titution, and giving effect to the mea&s;ures of the other departments. Every depart|ment, who&s;e power is wanted in the execution of a mea&s;ure, may judge of the authority of another, but not of its di&s;cretion; of its having acted within its con&s;titutional limits, but not of its having <HI>well</HI> acted. The di&s;cretion, the power of determing the propriety or impropriety of any con&s;titutional mea&s;ure, is exclu&s;ively committed, by the Con&s;titution, to the proper department. When it has determined, all other departments are bound by it. It is the Con&s;titution which binds them all.</P>
<P>The judiciary may judge of the con&s;titutionality of a law; but not of its propriety: the legi&s;lature alone can determine this&mdash;The executive may judge of the con&s;ti|tutionality of a judgment, of the juri&s;diction of the court over the &s;ubject, but not of the merits of the judgment. So, re&s;pecting any act or mea&s;ure of the department of foreign intercour&s;e, the Con&s;titution gives Congre&s;s no power to judge of the propriety of the mea&s;ure; if it can|not judge of the propriety of the mea&s;ure, it cannot judge of the propriety of the grant, any farther than under a &s;en&s;e of duty, to fix the amount, and choo&s;e the means of rai&s;ing it. Even Mr. G. admits that Congre&s;s has no right to dive&s;t the Pre&s;ident of any of his con&s;titutional
<PB N="39" REF="033268_0041_0FF6B228E3A06450">powers. And he con&s;iders the limitation of appropriations for an army, by any one Congre&s;s, to a term equal to its own duration, as &s;ufficiently dive&s;ting any one Congre&s;s of a power of rai&s;ing an army, &s;o as not to be under the control of another Congre&s;s. The power of withholding appropriations, for the acts of any department, is, on this principle, a power of re&s;training from acting, and of di|ve&s;ting this department of its con&s;titutional power. The Pre&s;ident has power to make treaties, and to appoint and receive amba&s;&s;adors. To deprive him of the means of &s;ending public mini&s;ters, is depriving him of the power of making treaties. On his own principles, Mr. G. mu&s;t admit, that this power is coupled with a di&s;cretion of judging with what nation, or in what manner, to form a treaty, or carry on an intercour&s;e by means of amba&s;&s;adors. Yet he avows it to be the object and effect of this claim of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, though not to annihilate the e&s;tabli&s;hment, "effectually to check its exten&s;ion." The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives then &s;ay, "Though the Con&s;titution has ve&s;ted the Pre&s;ident with a di&s;cretion, we will not permit him to execute it; but will dive&s;t him of his con&s;titutional power. It is true, we do not now, an|nihilate the e&s;tabli&s;hment, we choo&s;e only to retrench it; but when we have &s;ucceeded in this, the &s;ame arguments will enable us to annihilate. Surely, if we may now tell the Pre&s;ident, he &s;hall &s;end but three plenipotentiaries, we may, next year, tell him, he &s;hall &s;end but one; and the year following, none: and we will manage the foreign intercour&s;e our&s;elves as well as the powers of internal legi&s;lation. Who|ever has the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive command of the pur&s;e, is the &s;ole ma&s;ter; and if we can ca&s;t off the con&s;titutional limitations of our power, we &s;hall be &s;ole ma&s;ters. Are not we the Repre&s;entatives of the People?"</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="033268_0042_0FF6B243D65306E0">
I con&s;ider the People as the proprietor of a great e&s;tate, the different departments as his agents for the management of it; and the Con&s;titution as the in&s;tructions given them for their conduct, and the limitations of their authority.&mdash; He gives no predominancy of one over another; nor the whole of his own power to any; but a part of it to each. To one he gives power to manage his buildings, gardens and fields; to another of managing his law&s;uits, his di&s;|putes about his boundaries, or any claims of neighbouring proprietors of rights on his e&s;tate; and to another he gives the power of collecting his rents and debts, and paying out his money. Now, if this money agent, be|cau&s;e he has power to rai&s;e and pay money, has a right in all ca&s;es, before he grant, to enquire into the propriety or impropriety of the grant; it is clear that he has the &s;ole management of the e&s;tate, and that nothing can be done re&s;pecting the buildings, gardens, fields, boundaries, of di&s;putes of the proprietor, without the approbation of the money agent; and that he will have all the power of the proprietor, and be &s;ole agent. The proprietor never meant this. He meant only, that this money agent &s;hould take care, that his building agent &s;hould not draw money, for conducting law&s;uits; nor his law agent, for conducting the buildings, gardens or farms; but never meant, that when either of the other agents wanted money for the purpo&s;e of his agency, the money agent &s;hould have power to refu&s;e; or, before he granted, enquire whether the other agent had conducted his own bu&s;ine&s;s right. Every agent, for the purpo&s;es of his own department, is to every other, as the proprietor; and for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, has the &s;ame right as the proprietor, to call on the money agent for mo|ney; and a refu&s;al of the money agent, to furni&s;h any o|ther agent with the nece&s;&s;ary money to accompli&s;h his pur|po&s;es,
<PB N="41" REF="033268_0043_0FF6B2458D2D7D48">is a refu&s;al to obey the in&s;tructions of the proprietor, and amounts to a refu&s;al to furni&s;h the proprietor him&s;elf with money: for this other agent has, for his purpo&s;es, all the authority of the proprietor. The Con&s;titution is the will or in&s;tructions of the proprietor; the departments are the agents; Congre&s;s is the money agent. Every con&s;titutional act of any of the departments, being a re|gular exertion of the authority of the Con&s;titution, has the &s;ame authority over the other departments, as the Con&s;titution it&s;elf; and if it limit the power of the others, it is not this department, but the Con&s;titution which limits the power of the others. An authoritized act of the agent is an act of the principal. Therefore, if the con&s;titutional act of any department require money to give it effect, Congre&s;s is as much bound to grant it, as if the Con&s;ti|tution it&s;elf required the grant. Every act concluded un|der the authority of the Con&s;titution, is as binding as the Con&s;titution; and if an act of the legi&s;lature, of the judi|ciary, or of the department of foreign intercour&s;e, requires a grant of money, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;cutatives are as much bound to rai&s;e and grant it, as if the Con&s;titution required it. They can no more examine the propriety of the act, than the propriety of the Con&s;titution. They are but fel|low agents with the department to who&s;e di&s;cretion their common lord, the Con&s;titution, has exclu&s;ively intru&s;ted the judgment of the propriety or impropriety of the act, and have no power paramount over this department to judge of its di&s;cretion. If the other department has, according to its authority from the Con&s;titution, regularly concluded an act, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives has no di&s;cretion, whe|ther or not, to give it effect. What then is the di&s;cretion of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives? A di&s;cretion to enquire, whether the act be within the juri&s;diction of the other de|partment,
<PB N="42" REF="033268_0044_0FF6B247C9774F30">and how be&s;t to give it effect; a di&s;cretion, under a &s;en&s;e of duty, to determine the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to give it effect, and to devi&s;e the be&s;t ways and means to rai&s;e that &s;um. Each department has di&s;cretion, within its own juri&s;diction, of exerci&s;ing its powers, as it plea&s;es, agreeably to the Con&s;titution; or, if the Con&s;titution, or any other department, do not require it, under a &s;en&s;e of duty, to decline the exerci&s;e of its powers; but no depart|ment can, in the exerci&s;e of its own powers, defeat the con&s;titutional authority of another. An act of the depart|ment of foreign intercour&s;e may be con&s;idered as a law or a contract, and as there is no power in the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives to annul, they mu&s;t execute it, like any other law or contract.</P>
<P>To &s;hew, that this doctrine will not &s;tand the te&s;t of inve&s;tigation, Mr. G. &s;ays, "Whenever the powers ve&s;ted in any one department are &s;ufficient to complete a certain act, it would be uncon&s;titutional in any of the others, to control it. But whenever the powers have been &s;o di&s;tri|buted between two departments, in relation to another certain act, that neither of the two can complete the act, by its own power; each department is controlled by the other." This rea&s;oning &s;eems to be founded on a mi&s;ap|plication of words; by not di&s;tingui&s;hing between a right of determining on a mea&s;ure, and the power of directing the means of giving it effect; calling the fir&s;t an act, and the other a complete act. The fir&s;t is &s;urely, &s;o far as the word <HI>act</HI> can be applied to it, a complete act; and the re|fu&s;al of the means of giving it effect, is not a refu&s;al to complete, but a power to defeat or render u&s;ele&s;s; and the department which has completed the act, though it may not have the power it&s;elf to apply the means, may have a right to require the department, which has the means of
<PB N="43" REF="033268_0045_0FF6B28991E53510">giving it effect, to apply tho&s;e means for that purpo&s;e, and not, by denying the means, defeat the act. A judgment of a court is a compleat act; but the court has not the means of executing it; tho&s;e are intru&s;ted to the proper officers, the &s;heriff, &amp;c. but though the court it&s;elf cannot exert tho&s;e means; it has a right to require the officer to exert them, and it would be uncon&s;titutional in him to re|fu&s;e. Suppo&s;e a bill &s;hould pa&s;s both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, be approved by the Pre&s;ident, and become a law; it is a compleat act, yet it cannot be carried into execution with|out the aid of the executive and the judiciary. They only have the con&s;titutional power of executing it: have they al&s;o a con&s;titutional di&s;cretion to refu&s;e? Suppo&s;e, in the adjourn|ment of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, the Pre&s;ident perceives an emergency requiring a new mini&s;ter to be in&s;tantly di&s;|patched, without waiting for appropriations. The mini&s;ter is di&s;patched, and executes the commi&s;&s;ion. Has the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives a di&s;cretion to refu&s;e a compen&s;ation?</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity which Mr. G. &s;ees, in the doctrine for which I contend, is an ab&s;urdity of his own making, and ari&s;es from begging the que&s;tion, and &s;uppo&s;ing, that the department, which has the means of executing the com|pleat act of another department, has a right to refu&s;e tho&s;e means. I &s;ay it has no &s;uch right; and it is only he who &s;ays it has, who occa&s;ions the ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The novelty of this doctrine is no better proved than its ab&s;urdity. I have &s;hown how con&s;i&s;tent it is with the Con&s;titution. If tradition has made void the law, if poli|tical Scribes and Phari&s;ees have introduced their glo&s;&s;es in&s;tead of the text; no wonder if, when the true go&s;pel &s;hines out, it &s;hould be received by tho&s;e blind guides as novelty. To compare it to the &s;tate con&s;titutions, fur|ni&s;hes no evidence, for either there will be no re&s;emblance,
<PB N="44" REF="033268_0046_0FF6B24A75F439B0">or the &s;ame di&s;pute will exi&s;t. To compare it with the government of Britain, gives no evidence; &s;ince it is not principles of a Con&s;titution, but principles of corruption, which pre&s;erve the form of that government, and &s;upport the authority of the King again&s;t the authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Aided by corruption, the King, who has the power of making treaties, may &s;afely tru&s;t to Parlia|ment the di&s;cretion of executing them; if as Mr. G. &s;ays, "a progre&s;&s;ive patronage and a &s;y&s;tematic corrupting influ|ence have &s;unk Parliament to a nominal repre&s;entation, a mere machine, the convenience u&s;ed by government for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing &s;upplies; the medium through which the executive reach with ea&s;e the pur&s;e of the people. And now when the farce of obtaining even the nominal con&s;ent of Parliament is &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, the mini&s;try di&s;|pen&s;e with the ceremony." The u&s;e of corruption proves, that, without it, the King could not pre&s;erve his preroga|tives again&s;t the incroachments of the Hou&s;e of Commons. But, armed with this corruption, the King has as little to fear from the di&s;cretion of the Parliament, as Robe&s;pierre or the French Directory, armed with terror, could have to fear from the legi&s;lative Councils. But &s;urely either the one or the other model is unfit for our imitation. We want neither an Anglo-monarchico-ari&s;tocratic faction, nor a Gallo-demo-mobocratic faction, to de&s;troy the &s;tructure of the American Con&s;titution. Nor ought we to derive its con&s;truction, from the errors and corruptions of other governments, but from its own principles and organiza|tion.</P>
<P>The great fallacy in the rea&s;oning of Mr. G. ari&s;es by &s;ub&s;tituting the words <HI>rai&s;ing and granting</HI> money, in&s;tead of the words of the Con&s;titution; and confounding the power of rai&s;ing and granting money, with a power of creat|ing
<PB N="45" REF="033268_0047_0FF6B28B43B4E9E0">a nece&s;&s;ity for rai&s;ing and granting, and determining the reality and extent of that nece&s;&s;ity, and making the words <HI>rai&s;ing and granting,</HI> mean creating a nece&s;&s;ity or determining the reality and extent of a nece&s;&s;ity for granting. The&s;e are powers e&s;&s;entially different from the powers of rai&s;ing and granting. They are not, and con&s;i&s;tently with the views of the Con&s;titution, they could not be, ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s. To &s;ay, that they are implied in the powers of rai&s;ing and granting, is rea&s;oning without premi&s;es, and therefore inconclu&s;ively. They are not implied; and often exi&s;t &s;eparate from each other. To &s;ay that they are given to Congre&s;s, is taking a very narrow and imperfect view of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o given in many in&s;tances to other de|partments. It cannot be inferted, from the power of lay|ing taxes, and appropriating money, that this power is always free from an obligation to exert it; or that this ob|ligation cannot be impo&s;ed, but by the di&s;cretion of Con|gre&s;s. To judge of the propriety or impropriety of a grant for any object, in any other &s;en&s;e, than as to judge of the proper amount of the grant, and the proper means of pro|curing and applying the money, is to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the object; and the management of this may, in many ca&s;es, be committed to another department with di&s;cretion exclu&s;ive and equal, as derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, the Con&s;titution. A man is only free to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the grant, in the &s;en&s;e contended for, when he has an arbitrary power over the money. For, if he have it in tru&s;t from the owner, to apply it, as not only he, but his fellow agents may deter|mine; he may often have no di&s;cretion to refu&s;e. Congre&s;s is but a fellow agent with the other departments, and like every other organ of power, takes all its powers couple
<PB N="46" REF="033268_0048_0FF6B24CB43F3E80">with duties; its power to make, therefore, coupled with a duty to make all laws nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the powers of the Con&s;titution, and all other powers ve&s;ted in the government, or in any department or officer thereof. The di&s;cretion of Congre&s;s to judge of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of any law, is bounded by the di&s;cretion of every other department, in the execution of their con&s;titutional authority. Where either the Con&s;ti|tution it&s;elf dictates the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of a law, or gives to any other department, or officer, the di&s;cretion to judge of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of a law, Congre&s;s has no di&s;cretion left to judge of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of making the law, but only of choo&s;ing the be&s;t law to ac|compli&s;h the object of the other department. Its power is abridged by the Con&s;titution. A claim of Congre&s;s then, to a di&s;cretion to judge of the propriety of a law which the Con&s;titution, or any department with authority derived from the Con&s;titution, may have declared to be nece&s;&s;ary, is a claim of all power in the government, or a power to refu&s;e what the Con&s;titution, or the con&s;tituted authorities, may have declared nece&s;&s;ary. When nature may create a nece&s;&s;ity, or the Con&s;titution or any department may make an engagement or legal declaration; a claim in Congre&s;s, to a right to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the grant, is not, and con&s;i&s;tently with the views of the Con|&s;titution, cannot be ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, for it is a claim to a&s;&s;ume univer&s;al power, or a claim to a&s;&s;ume a power over the principles of the Con&s;titution, a power over the principles of nature and morals, and therefore a power over God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have now examined the rea&s;oning of Mr. G. on the con&s;titutional principle; and as we know, that motives as pure as his, are no &s;ecurity again&s;t danger, I think it
<PB N="47" REF="033268_0049_0FF6B24EA26269F8">will appear, that judgment, as clear as his, is no &s;ecurity again&s;t error.&mdash;The fact is, that it is not from a want of obligation on the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to appropriate money, but from a want of power to compel compliance, if they choo&s;e to di&s;regard this obligation. Impunity is often confounded with di&s;cretion, Suppo&s;e the judiciary refu&s;e to decide on a law; how can they be compelled? They may be impeached and removed. But &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame ob&s;tinacy &s;hould exi&s;t in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; the go|verment would be di&s;&s;olved: for no other department can exerci&s;e their authority. If an inferior court refu&s;e the exerci&s;e of its powers, a &s;uperior court may compel it, by <HI>mandamus.</HI> No <HI>mandamus</HI> can go to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. We have no Pari&s;ian mob to &s;urround their hall with pikes and cannon. They cannot be im|peached; for they have the &s;ole power of impeaching.&mdash; And the only compul&s;ive force on them, is the removing power of the people, the elective branch. This is the tribunal before which they are tried; but, as &s;aving mo|ney is generally popular, and the people is often ill inform|ed, the Repre&s;entatives take means to e&s;cape from judg|ment, by prejudicing the judges, by ince&s;&s;antly and widely &s;preading among them mi&s;repre&s;entations of all the mea|&s;ures, which they oppo&s;e, and of all the acts of the admi|ni&s;tration. Though there be therefore a po&s;itive obliga|tion, there being no compul&s;ive power to enforce it, impunity is con&s;trued as di&s;cretion; and the "moral obli|gation" of a &s;en&s;e of duty, can alone enforce the exertion of "the con&s;titutional power." And this it &s;eems is "a metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtlety!"</P>
<P>Of all public officers, we have the lea&s;t hold, by means of a &s;en&s;e of duty, on repre&s;entatives accountable to none but to the people: e&s;pecially in granting money not to be
<PB N="48" REF="033268_0050_0FF6B28D8B9339F0">expended by them&s;elves. The confederation directed that all charges of war, and all other expences that &s;hall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by Congre&s;s, &s;hall be defrayed out of a common trea&s;ury, which &s;hall be &s;upplied by the &s;everal &s;tates; and al&s;o directed that every &s;tate &s;hall abide by the determina|tion of Congre&s;s on all que&s;tions &s;ubmitted to them; and &s;hall inviolably ob&s;erve the articles of Confederation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art.</HI> 8.1</NOTE>.&mdash; Here was po&s;itive and moral duty united. Yet, when danger cea&s;ed, were both po&s;itive and moral duty &s;ufficient to per&s;uade the &s;tate legi&s;latures to comply with the requi|&s;itions of Congre&s;s?</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming the cordial concurrence of each department, to carry into effect the con&s;titutional acts of any other; as Solon made no law again&s;t parricide, apprehending it im|po&s;&s;ible, that any one &s;hould be guilty of &s;o unnatural a barbarity, the Con&s;titution forbears to command any de|partment to ab&s;tain from a re&s;i&s;tance to the authority of any other, which would de&s;troy their common parent.</P>
<P>To the policy of extending or abridging foreign inter|cour&s;e, I &s;ay nothing. Re&s;ting on the con&s;titutional prin|ciple, it is &s;ufficient for me, that the Con&s;titution has excluded the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives from all manage|ment of foreign intercour&s;e; and thought it &s;afe, to tru&s;t the whole di&s;cretion of managing it, to the Pre&s;ident, act|ing under the check of the Senate. The Con&s;titution has con&s;idered the Pre&s;ident, as a &s;afe depo&s;itary of this authority, and the Senate as a &s;ufficient check; and to the acts of this authority, as to the authority of the Con&s;ti|tution, it behoves the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to bow! as it behoves the Pre&s;ident, in his turn, to bow to the authority of Congre&s;s as expre&s;&s;ed by law.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="033268_0051_0FF6B250DDC0F180">
Every act done under the authority of the Con&s;titution is, till it be annulled by the department which gave it ex|i&s;tence, as binding on every department, as the Con&s;titu|tion it&s;elf: thus not only the Con&s;titution, but the laws and treaties of the United States are declared the &s;upreme law. And the que&s;tion is not, whether any department may, in the exerci&s;e of its own authority, exerci&s;e di&s;cre|tion; but whether it may al&s;o exerci&s;e di&s;cretion over the authority of another department: whether the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives be free to do as it plea&s;es, and, uncontrol|led by the con&s;titutional acts of any other department, &s;et it&s;elf up as paramount over all, and ab&s;orb, in it&s;elf, the authority of all the departments. It is a que&s;tion of pride, of ambition in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a power to prevent any thing being done, by any other de|partment, without their approbation; that is, to acquire arbitrary power. And this they ju&s;tify, under a pretence of preventing extravagance and abu&s;e of authority.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e ca&s;es, of a nature &s;o extraordi|nary, as to ju&s;tify one department, in a&s;&s;uming a power not given it, to defeat the acts of another. Per&s;onal liberty is a con&s;titutional right; but if a man u&s;e it dangerou&s;ly, it may be abridged. An emergency &s;o critical may exi&s;t, that, to encounter it, a violation of the Con&s;titution it&s;elf may become a duty. No argument can be drawn from this: for abu&s;e of power is a &s;uppo&s;ition which may be made in all departments, and is &s;urely not le&s;s pre&s;umable, in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, than in the Pre&s;ident and the Senate. So far as the Con&s;titution intends, that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;hould have this power to pre|vent extravagance, it is not di&s;puted with them. They have the di&s;cretion, controlled only by a &s;en&s;e of duty, to ad|ju&s;t the amount of the grant to the nature of the object,
<PB N="50" REF="033268_0052_0FF6B28F436F6CD0">and to choo&s;e the means of rai&s;ing and applying the mo|ney. To give them more, would be giving them all power: and if this be nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve us from abu&s;e in other departments; who, if they obtain this, &s;hall pre&s;erve us from abu&s;e in them? What &s;ecurity have we, that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives may not act as extravagantly as the Pre&s;ident and Senate? Are large popular bodies le&s;s liable to extravagance, pa&s;&s;ion, partiality, and ambi|tion, than an individual, or a &s;mall &s;elect body, re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct? Have they not their favourites? Have they not their ma&s;ters? Give them the power claimed, would the other departments have any chance of pre&s;erv|ing the &s;hadowy fragment of remaining authority? Would not the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;oon render odious the other departments, and render it impo&s;&s;ible for the people to know the truth? The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives would be erected into a national convention, the centre of all authority; its opinions, its agents, its influence would &s;pread ramifications of its power, and receive nouri&s;hment, in every part of the nation; and all its power would cen|tre in a Mirabeau or a Robe&s;pierre.</P>
<P>How tyranny or ruin may have come on other nations, unle&s;s in &s;o far as their circum&s;tances re&s;emble ours, it is not material to enquire. Our Executive has not, and cannot have, an uncontrolled command of the pur&s;e of the people. Nor is there any kind of re&s;emblance between the power of appointing mini&s;ters, and the ca&s;e of &s;hip|money. That ca&s;e was a claim of exerci&s;ing, not only the power which the King had, but the power which he had not; a power of laying and collecting taxes, as well as declaring their nece&s;&s;ity, a power to fix the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary, as well as to declare the object. And whatever deductions may be made from hi&s;tory, it will be found, that tyranny
<PB N="51" REF="033268_0053_0FF6B291F3DE9850">has ari&s;en from the turbulence and refractory conduct of the people, or the other departments; from an abu&s;e of liberty or di&s;cretion; from contentions for power, crea|ting a pretence, and from the circum&s;tances of the Execu|tive furni&s;hing the means, of acquiring a predominancy; and from the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing, when <HI>any</HI> government has &s;uper&s;eded the anxiety of di&s;tractions, ju&s;tifying the &s;ucce&s;s, and favouring the e&s;tabli&s;hment, of this predo|minancy.</P>
<P>"The events of the reign of Charles the fir&s;t" are in|deed "a proof of the danger to be apprehended from the incroachments of the legi&s;lature. They were the re&s;ult of an un&s;ettled Con&s;titution. The preci&s;e boundaries of power were not a&s;certained: Convul&s;ions, a civil war, a revolution en&s;ued." Very natural con&s;equences, from a ca&s;e exactly like the pre&s;ent! Where is the dif|ference between an un&s;ettled con&s;titution, and a con&s;titu|tion, the con&s;truction of which, by tho&s;e who admini&s;ter it, is un&s;ettled? If the preci&s;e boundaries of power be a&s;certained, what is the ground of di&s;pute between the department of foreign intercour&s;e, and the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives? The ca&s;es are the &s;ame, let us take warning by the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In the contra&s;t, which Mr. G. draws, between the Pre|&s;ident's &s;peech to Congre&s;s, and the late Pre&s;ident's ad|dre&s;s to the people; he cites the following &s;entence of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech. "However we may con&s;ider our&s;elves, the maritime and commercial powers of the world will con&s;ider the United States of America, as forming a <HI>weight in that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or neglected.</HI>" Mr. G. recites the la&s;t clau&s;e of this &s;entence thus, <HI>"As to that balance of power in Eu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI>
<PB N="52" REF="033268_0054_0FF6B25391682188">the word <HI>"weight,"</HI> the e&s;&s;ential word in the Pre&s;ident's &s;entence, and the only word expre&s;&s;ing the idea which, he &s;ays, was never to be forgotten or neglected. The Pre|&s;ident's meaning plainly is that the maritime and commer|cial powers of the world will never forget or neglect the <HI>weight,</HI> which the United States of America form, in the balance of power in Europe. Mr. G. &s;eems to cite this, as if the Pre&s;ident thought, that the United States ought never to forget or neglect the balance of power in Europe, but "involve it&s;elf in the de&s;tinies and wars of Europe."</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have made this ob&s;ervation, had it been altogether unconnected with the principles and con&s;equen|ces of the point in di&s;pute. But as the members who oppo&s;e this con&s;titutional principle, in order to ju&s;tify their oppo&s;ition, and render the principle odious, loudly and widely clamour, that there is a <HI>war party</HI> in the ad|mini&s;tration, and that the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> is at the head of this <HI>war party;</HI> and as the quotation of Mr. G. might convey the &s;ame idea; thinking this idea fal&s;e, I made this ob|&s;ervation.
