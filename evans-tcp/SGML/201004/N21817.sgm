<P>ARLACKSMITH in a country town, while &s;hoeing a hor&s;e, was gazed at by a number of negroes as they were pa&s;&s;ing by; being a little piqued at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing the object of the blacks' attention, and attempting to ca&s;t a &s;lur upon them, he &s;aid, "I believe hell's broke loo&s;e."&mdash;"Yes, ma&s;&s;a," &s;ays one, "I &s;ee de devil has got hold de hor&s;e's foot."</P>
<P>A trade&s;man, who&s;e love of money made him per&s;cribe, as beneficial to his &s;ervants" health, and his own profit, the practice of early ri&s;ing, one morning gave a poor black man a &s;evere &s;colding for &s;uffering the &s;un to &s;hine on him while in bed&mdash;concluding his lectures with a &s;evere threat, if he &s;hould ever after find him not up at &s;un ri&s;e.

<P>A very pious gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from Bo&s;ton, made
<PB N="6" REF="028720_0004_0FDA61A665132278">it his con&s;tant practice to call up his family before day, in order that they might attend prayers, and be ready for their labour in good &s;ea&s;on: One morning having mu&s;tered his family rather earlier than common, he com|menced family duties by prayer, during which, he returned thanks to the Lord, that they were brought to &s;ee the light of another day: An old negro &s;tanding by, cried out, "Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, ma&s;&s;a, &s;artin no day yet."</P>

<P>Mr. Mackenzie, who has &s;ometimes been called the Scots Addi&s;on, is by profe&s;&s;ion an attorney. He was lately in company with &s;ir William Howe, in the Highlands of Scotland. After dinner, the conve&s;ation happened to turn upon poi&s;on; the various effects of different &s;pecies were mentioned, and among others, tho&s;e of rat&s;bane and laurel water. "We &s;ay in England," &s;aid the general to Mr. Macken|zie, "that rat&s;bane will not kill a lawyer."&mdash; "And we &s;ay in Scotland," replied the wit, "that &s;ome generals are in no danger from laurel."</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, one Tom Hide, an Indian, famous for his cunning, went into a ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n at
<PB N="7" REF="028720_0005_0FDA61A7A709C640">Brookfield, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and after a little talk, told the landlord, he had been hunting, had killed a fine fat deer, and that if he would give him a quart of rum, he would tell him where it was.&mdash;The landlord did not wi&s;h to let &s;lip &s;o good an opportunity to obtain the veni&s;on, and immediately mea&s;ured the Indian his rum&mdash;"Well," &s;ays Tom, "do you know where the great meadow is?" "Yes"&mdash;"Well, do you know where the great marked maple tree that &s;tands in it, is?"&mdash;"Yes"&mdash;"Well there lies the deer." Away po&s;ted the tavern|er with his team, in que&s;t of his purcha&s;e: He found the meadow and the tree; but his &s;earchings after the deer were in vain; and he returned no heavier, but in chagrin, than he went. Some days after, he met the Indian, and violently accu&s;ed him of a deception. Tom heard him out, and with the coolne&s;s of a philo&s;opher replied, "did you find the mead|ow, as I &s;aid?"&mdash;"Yes," "and the tree?"&mdash; "Yes"&mdash;"and the deer?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Ve|ry good," continues he&mdash;"you found two truths to one li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which was very well for an Indian."</P>
<P>A certain trading ju&s;tice in Bo&s;ton, notori|ous for his profe&s;&s;ional ingenuity, &s;ome time &s;ince employed a poor man to &s;aw a load of wood, for which he agreed to give him eigh|teen pence. The man, in order to be more ex|peditious in the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tripped off his coat and laid it in the &s;treet.&mdash;After fini&s;hing the job, he found, to his &s;urpri&s;e, that the coat had vani&s;hed, and a&s;king the ju&s;tice, who had been at the door, nearly the whole time, if he had &s;een any thing of it&mdash;the worthy magi&s;trate re|plied, "he had found a coat in the &s;treet," and

<P>Some years &s;ince, an Indian re&s;ided in the metropolis of a neighbouring &s;tate; he gained his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by his indu&s;try, and being a ve|ry handy fellow, he was frequently employed by many in the city, particularly by the gov|ernor. The Indian, who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph, took the liberty of enquiring of the governor, how it came to pa&s;s he had &s;o many fine things about him and never worked any? The gov|ernor
<PB N="9" REF="028720_0007_0FDA61AB92904DD8">replied that he got them by headwork. Joe wi&s;hed to be in&s;tructed in the my&s;tery, but was informed his &s;cull was too thick for it. Some time after, Joe was &s;ent for by the gov|ernor, who demanded to know what he would have for killing a calf? Joe &s;aid, he would do it for two &s;hillings: He was de&s;ired to go to the &s;table and perform the bu&s;ine&s;s; he went, cut the calf's throat, and left him lying there: after &s;ome delay he went to the hou&s;e, and re|ceived his pay: Soon after the governor went to &s;ee how his veal looked, but was a&s;toni&s;hed to find the calf lying dead, and nothing more done to it. He &s;ent for the Indian, repri|manded him &s;everely for treating him &s;o. Joe in&s;i&s;ted that he had complied fully with his agreement; &s;aying he had killed the calf, and that for two &s;hillings more he would dre&s;s it, a&s;king the governor if that was not &s;omething like headwork?</P>
<P>Some years ago, immediately after the &s;hock of a tremendous earthquake had alarmed the inhabitants of Grenada, the conver&s;ation turn|ed at the governor's table, upon the latent oc|ca&s;ion of the above phaenomenon; after every one of the company had a&s;&s;igned it to a differ|ent cau&s;e, an old negro woman was a&s;ked, what was her opinion on the &s;ubject; &s;he replied, "&s;he thought the Great God was pa&s;&s;ing by, and the earth had made him a curt&s;y."</P>
<P>Several runaway negroes being condemn|ed to be hanged, one was offered his life, on condition of being the executioner. He re|fu&s;ed it: he would &s;ooner die. The ma&s;ter fixed on another of his &s;laves to perform the office. "Stay," &s;aid this la&s;t, "'till I prepare
<PB N="10" REF="028720_0008_0FDA61AEC671B820">my&s;elf." He in&s;tantly retired to his hut, and cut off his wri&s;t with an axe. Returning to his ma&s;ter, "now," &s;aid he, "compel me, if you can, to hang my comrades."</P>
<P>During the late war, an elderly gen|tleman from New-York, who was at bottom a &s;taunch loyali&s;t, but &s;o fond of argument, that he would occa&s;ionally take up the &s;ubject of the war and argue upon it either pro or con&mdash; being once at a coffeehou&s;e in London, when that topic was in agitation, and then defend|ing the cau&s;e of the Americans, one of the company, more &s;anguine than the re&s;t, round|ly a&s;&s;erted, there could be no doubt of conquer|ing the Americans, notwith&s;tanding the &s;upe|riority of their numbers; for that one Eng|li&s;hman could drive an hundred of them.&mdash; Pray, do you think &s;ir, &s;aid the Yankee, you could atchieve &s;o noble an exploit? Perhaps not, replied the hero, upon &s;o great a number&mdash; Could you drive fifty?&mdash;No&mdash;Could you drive twenty?&mdash;No&mdash;Could you drive one?&mdash; O yes, by G&mdash;d, I could do that ea&s;ily at any time.&mdash;Then, &s;ir, &s;aid the old gentleman, as you are an Engli&s;hman, and I am an American, if you plea&s;e, drive me. The political brag|gadocia, drew in his horns, and &s;neaked off.</P>
<P>Colonel Cockburn ro&s;e from a private &s;oldier to the rank which he enjoyed when St. Eu&s;tatius was retaken.&mdash;Of this circum|&s;tance he was continually boa&s;ting, and upon occa&s;ions where it proved more pride than humility.&mdash;One day in the i&s;land of St. Eu|&s;tatius, he was reviewing his troops, and took notice of a man in the ranks who was exce&s;|&s;ively dirty.&mdash;Going up to him, he &s;aid, "how

<P>A per&s;on of the name of Palmer, who was a lieutenant in the tory new levies, was detected in the camp at Peek's kiln. Governor Tryon, who commanded the new levies, re|claimed him as a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, repre&s;ented the heinous crime of condemning a man com|mi&s;&s;ioned by his maje&s;ty, an threatened ven|geance in ca&s;e he &s;hould be executed. Gener|al Putnam wrote him the following pithy re|ply:</P>

<P>A lady in Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, &s;aid, before one of her little girls, that Mrs. T&mdash;(a ro&s;y widow, whom they vi&s;ited in the next &s;treet) was a very good &s;ort of a woman, and a very entertaining companion, when &s;he had not a drop in her eye.</P>
<P>A few days after, Mrs. T&mdash; came to the hou&s;e, and little Charlotte took more notice of her than &s;he u&s;ually did. She &s;tared in her
<PB N="12" REF="028720_0010_0FDA61B2835C84F8">face, indeed, in &s;o pointed a manner, that the lady could not help being de&s;irous of knowing, "what &s;he &s;aw in her countenance, to occa|&s;ion &s;o critical an examination."</P>
<P>"I am looking," replied the child, with a pretty innocent voice, "to &s;ee if there is a drop in your eye."</P>
<P>A gentleman riding out one morning early in a place where he happened not to be acquainted; coming up by the &s;ide of a young woman who was carrying a pig in her arms, and hearing it &s;cream violently, addre&s;&s;ed her thus: "why, my dear, your child cries amaz|ingly!" The young woman, turning round, and looking him in the face, &s;aid, with a &s;mile upon her countenance, "I know it, &s;ir, it al|ways does &s;o, when it &s;ees its daddy."</P>
<P>As a gentleman, in a certain coffee hou&s;e, was writing a letter to his friend, there being a good deal of company pre&s;ent, a pert young fellow po&s;ted him&s;elf behind him.&mdash; The gentleman concluded his letter with the&s;e words: I &s;hould write more, but there is an impudent puppy looking over my &s;houlder.&mdash; The macaroni in&s;tantly turned upon his heels, and exclaimed aloud, "I'll be d&mdash;d if I was looking over your &s;houlder."</P>
<P>The great Mr. Dalmahoy went in com|pany with a friend lately to bedlam, to &s;ee the lunatics there. Among other unhappy ob|jects, he &s;aw a man quite naked, who called out for him to come to the grate. He did &s;o. The madman &s;aid, come, &s;ir, you are admiral of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fleet.&mdash;I am admiral of the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> us not put our innocent men to death. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this &s;word, (handing him a &s;traw)

Dalmahoy took the &s;traw, and the oth|er throwing him&s;elf into an attitude, made &s;everal pa&s;&s;es through the grate, which Dalma|hoy humoured. At la&s;t the madman dropped his &s;traw, and &s;aid, "you have di&s;armed me: but if you are a man of honor you will permit me to take up my &s;word again." Dalmahoy &s;aid, "by all means." The madman &s;tooped, but in&s;tead of the &s;traw, took up a large jordan, and da&s;hed the contents in Dalmahoy's face, crying out, "there, d&mdash;n you, go and tell your king what a &s;tinking admiral he pitched upon to fight with me."</P>
<P>A fellow who had been engaged to prove an alib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on a late trial, after declaring roundly that the pri&s;oner was in his hou&s;e at the time the robbery was commited, was a&s;ked by the coun&s;ellor for the pro&s;ecutor, whether he had not heard that the pri&s;oner had con|fe&s;&s;ed his guilt? Yes, &s;aid he, gravely, but he was always a d&mdash;d lying dog.</P>
<P>A man went to &s;ee his neighbour who was ill, and &s;itting down by his bed &s;ide, a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions concerning the &s;tate of his health; which the other, who was &s;udden|ly taken &s;peechle&s;s, could not an&s;wer. This highly offended his vi&s;itor, who was not con|&s;cious of the cau&s;e; and ri&s;ing in a rage, told him, "that plea&s;e God he would be &s;ick him|&s;elf &s;oon, and when he came to &s;ee him, the d&mdash;l a word he would &s;ay to him, that noth|ing might be lo&s;t."</P>

<P>A notorious mi&s;er, having heard a very elo|quent charity &s;ermon, "this &s;ermon," &s;aid he, "&s;trongly proves the nece&s;&s;ity of alms; I had almo&s;t a mind to beg."</P>
<P>A young man, who has attended con&s;idera|bly to arithmetic, and formed pretty towering ideas of his &s;kill in that &s;cience, the other day addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to an African in the follow|ing manner: "Bo&s;ton, I can take a pen and ink, and in three minutes can cypher out and tell you how many minutes you have to live." "Canna you, ma&s;&s;a, you mu&s;t be a very good cypher indeed. I a&s;ka you a que&s;tion. Which can &s;ee be&s;t, a mare &s;tone blind, or a hor&s;e without eyes?" Pho, that's no que&s;tion at all." "I a&s;ke you another,&mdash;'po&s;e he be ten rods to Nicholas's, how far you call him away out yonder?" "That I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tell neither," replied he. "Well, I a&s;ke one more," po&s;e fifty rail make one load, how many he take to make a d&mdash;d great pile?" So many unan&s;werable que&s;tions quite confounded our young conceit|ed arithmetician. He began to think he did not know every thing, and retreated from the li&s;ts of his African antagoni&s;t, with &s;hame and confu&s;ion,</P>
<P>One of the king's &s;oldiers in the civil wars, being full of zeal and liquor, &s;taggered again&s;t a church, and clapping the wall of it repeated|ly with his hand, hiccupped out, d&mdash;n you, you b&mdash;h, never fear, I'll &s;tand by you to the la&s;t.</P>

A dragoon was &s;hot in Dublin for de&s;ertion, and taking away his hor&s;e and accoutrements at the &s;ame time. When on his trial, an of|ficer a&s;ked him what could induce him to take away his hor&s;e? To which he replied, "he ran away with him." What, &s;aid the officer, did you do with the money you &s;old him for? "That, plea&s;e your honour," &s;aid the fellow, with the utmo&s;t indifference, "ranaway too."</P>
<P>Two friends, who had not &s;een each other for a long time, met one day by accident.&mdash; "How do you do?" &s;ays one, "&s;o, &s;o," re|plied the other; "and yet I was married, &s;ince you and I were together."&mdash;"That is good news."&mdash;"Not very good&mdash;for it was my lot to meet with a termagant."&mdash;"It is pity."&mdash; "I hardly think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&mdash;for &s;he brought me two thou&s;and pounds."&mdash;"Well, there is comfort." &mdash;"Not much&mdash;for with her fortune I pur|cha&s;ed a quantity of &s;heep, and they all died of the rot."&mdash;"That is indeed di&s;tre&s;&s;ing."&mdash; "Not &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as you imagine&mdash;for by the &s;ale of their &s;kins, I got more than the &s;heep co&s;t me."&mdash;"In that ca&s;e you are indeminifi|ed."&mdash;"By no means&mdash;for my hou&s;e and all my money have been de&s;troyed by fire."&mdash; "Alas! this was a dreadful misfortune."&mdash; "Faith, not &s;o dreadful&mdash;for my termagant wife and my hou&s;e were burned together."</P>
<P>The wife of a farmer, on an e&s;tate near Richmond, was taken in labour: the farmer wi&s;hed for a &s;on, and waited in the next room for the intelligence: it proved a boy, and the man jumped from his chair with ec&s;tacy. A few minutes after, the maid &s;ervant came in,

<P>When George Whitfield fir&s;t came to Charle&s;ton in South Carolina, the Rev. Alex|ander Garden was epi&s;copal mini&s;ter of that place.

<P>It is recorded to the honour of the famous duke of Orleans, who was regent of France during the minority of the late king, that when a man was hired to murder him, and by his &s;pies procured intelligence of it, in&s;tead of endeavouring to defeat the de&s;ign, he gave orders that the man &s;hould be admitted to him. Accordingly he was &s;uffered to pa&s;s into the duke's bed chamber one morning early, on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s from the queen. As &s;oon as the duke ca&s;t his eyes on him, he &s;poke thus: "I know thy bu&s;ine&s;s, friend, thou art &s;ent to take away my life. What hurt have I done thee? It is now in my power, with a word, to have thee cut to pieces before my face. But I pardon thee, go thy way and &s;ee my face no more." The gentleman, &s;tung with his own guilt, and a&s;toni&s;hed at the excellent nature of this prince, fell on his knees, confe&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign, and who employed him; but fearing to tarry in France, he immediately departed the kingdom, and entered him&s;elf into the &s;er|vice of the king of Spain.</P>

The&s;e men at fir&s;t were lying down and pretended to &s;leep. But one &s;oon ro&s;e up, and approaching the emperor, told him, that he had dreamt he ought to take away his hat, and in &s;aying &s;o &s;natched it from him. A &s;econd then came to him, &s;ay|ing he had dreamt that his &s;ourtout would fit him very well, and took that from him. A third ca&s;t his eye upon his buff jacket, and &s;tript him of it. The fourth dreamt likewi&s;e in his turn, and tells the prince not to take it ami&s;s, if he gave him&s;elf the trouble to &s;earch him, and &s;eeing a gold chain about his neck, to which hung a flagelet, he went to take it from him: &s;tay, my friend, &s;aid the emperor to him, before you rob me of this dear little toy, &s;uffer me to &s;hew you the properties of it, and at the &s;ame time he began to whi&s;tle.

<P>At an election, when parties were violent, each warmly canva&s;&s;ing for &s;uffrages, a cap|tain of a &s;hip, then lying at the wharf, took his &s;eamen to a magi&s;trate, paid a tax for each, and procured a certificate of the pay|ment&mdash;then putting &s;uch tickets or votes in their hands, as he plea&s;ed, led them to the &s;tatehou&s;e, where they all longed their votes.</P>
<P>On the return of the &s;hip the next voyage, ju&s;t before &s;he arrived in Delaware bay, &s;he was &s;urrounded by a va&s;t multitude of por|poi&s;es, pur&s;uing a we&s;terly cour&s;e with the &s;hip.

<P>Soon after the &s;ettlement of Virginia, cap|tain Smith, then pre&s;ident of the council, con|ducted a party of men a few miles from James|town, to cut timber.&mdash;Among the re&s;t were two gentlemen, who had not been u&s;ed to la|bour. As they were at work, their fingers began to be bli&s;tered, and the pain of holding their axes was &s;uch as to extort an oath at ev|ery third blow. To prevent this, the pre&s;i|dent ordered the oaths each day to be num|bered, and at night condemned each man to have a can of water for each oath poured into his &s;leeve.

<P>When the American war was warmly agi|tated by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, Mrs. Wright, who was modelling the head of lord North, anxious to hear &s;omething re&s;pecting her na|tive country, waited on him, to &s;ee how far &s;he had improved in the likene&s;s; and &s;oon turned the conver&s;ation to the affairs of Amer|ica.

<P>In the year 1785, a farmer of Bucks' coun|ty, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his people, working in harve&s;t, killed a rattle&s;nake; and &s;oon after having occa&s;ion to go home, took up by mi&s;take his &s;on's jacket, and put it on; the &s;on was a &s;tripling, and both their jackets were made of the &s;ame kind of cloth. The old man being warm, did not button the jacket until he got to the hou&s;e, then found it much too little for him: he in&s;tantly conceived the idea, that he had been imperceptibly bitten by the rattle|&s;nake, and &s;welled from the effects of the poi|&s;on; he grew &s;uddenly very ill, and was put to bed.

<P>At the &s;iege of Charle&s;ton, an American &s;oldier had been bribed to convey to the ene|my a plan and &s;tate of the works, ammuni|tion, &amp;c. After he had pa&s;&s;ed the lines, he was di&s;covered by the piquette; who, having repeatedly called on him to return, were at length obliged to fire at him, and wounded him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that he could not proceed. Upon ex|amining the papers with which he was charg|ed, they were found &s;o accurately and ingeni|ou&s;ly executed, that General Lincoln was con|vinced they were the work of another hand, and offered the &s;oldier his life, provided he would di&s;cover the per&s;on in the garri&s;on, who had employed him.

The u&s;ual arrangements were therefore made for his execution, and the rope being tied about his neck, the General hoped that &s;uch circum|&s;tances might have &s;haken his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rtitude, and

The &s;ignal was immediately given, he was con&s;igned to eternity, under the impre&s;&s;ion of this noble &s;entiment: And it is remarka|ble, that the hangman, as he de&s;cended from his duty, was killed by a &s;hot from the Briti&s;h piquette. Such conduct, however, proves the incon&s;i&s;tency of the human character; nor is it ea&s;y to conceive, how a mind, &s;o &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve its dignity in a matter merely per|&s;onal, &s;hould have conde&s;cended to engage in a treachery, de&s;tructive to publick confidence and allegiance.</P>
<P>During the late war, an old citizen of Charle&s;town happened to fall into the hands of a party of Briti&s;h troops, in one of their excur&s;ions to Dorche&s;ter. On the party's re|turning towards town, they &s;topped to refre&s;h them&s;elves at a plantation on Goo&s;e creek; and the &s;oldiers began to jeer their pri&s;oner for rebelling again&s;t the king. He not wi&s;h|ing to offend them (as his life had been threatened, and they were then preparing a halter for a pri&s;oner) an&s;wered, that he had enjoyed many happy days under the reign of George the &s;econd, and &s;ome agreeable mo|ments &s;ince the pre&s;ent gentleman came to the crown. The commanding officer, a Caledoni|an, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a&s;leep, imagining the pri&s;oner intended to degrade &s;he royalty of his king, jumped up in a violent rage, and a&s;ked how he had the audacions a&s;&s;urance of

<P>The Peruvians had a cu&s;tom, on the death of any di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on, to inter along with him to keep him company, the &s;ervant that had been attached to him in his life.

<P>About fifty years ago, the general a&s;&s;embly of New hamp&s;hire u&s;ed to fit in a tavern.

<P>Dr. John&s;on being engaged by Mr. O&s;borne, a book&s;eller, to tran&s;late a work of &s;ome con|&s;equence, he thought it a re&s;pect which he owed his own talents, as well as the credit of his employer, to be as circum&s;pect in the per|formance of it as po&s;&s;ible.

Upon which Smith &s;ent him word again, that he had &s;et up an hour gla&s;s, and if he did not &s;ubmit to the &s;earch before it was run out, he would &s;ink him. The Dutchman &s;eeing it was in vain to contend with &s;uperior force, &s;ubmitted in time; and &s;o all the money was found. The next time Cromwell &s;aw lord Orrery, he told him, he had his intelligence from that &s;eemingly for|lorn Jew, he &s;aw him go to &s;ome days before.</P>
<P>When the E&s;&s;ay on Man was fir&s;t publi&s;h|ed, it came out in part and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name. A little after the appearance of the fir&s;t, Mr.
<PB N="137" REF="028720_0135_0FDA62E1250372D8">Morris, who attempted tho&s;e things in the poetical way, particularly a piece for mu&s;ick, which was performed in private before &s;ome of the royal family, accidentally paid a vi&s;it to Mr. Pope, who, after the fir&s;t civilities were over, inquired of him what news there was in the learned world; and what new pieces were brought to light? Morris replied, that there was little or nothing; or at lea&s;t little or nothing worth notice: That there was indeed a thing come out called an E&s;|&s;ay on Man, the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, threatening more, for he had read it, and it was a mo&s;t a|bomicable piece of &s;tuff, &s;hocking poetry, un|&s;ufferable philo&s;ophy, no coherence, no con|nexion at all. If I had thought (continued he) that you had not &s;een it, I would have brought it with me. Upon this Mr. Pope frankly told him, "that he had &s;een it before it went to pre&s;s, for it was his own writing, a work of years, and the poetry &s;uch as he thought proper for the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub|ject; on which &s;ide he did not imagine it would ever have been attacked, e&s;pecially by any man pretending to knowledge in the har|mony of numbers." This was like a clap of thunder to the mi&s;taken bard: He reached his hat, and with a blu&s;h and a bow, took his leave of Mr. Pope, and never more ventured to &s;hew his unlucky face there again.</P>
<P>When the army of Lewis XIV. of France was encamped in Flanders during his war with the confederates, the king u&s;ed &s;ometimes to re&s;ide at the head quarters him&s;elf. It hap|pened, that a very fine hor&s;e, which he had lately purcha&s;ed, was exerci&s;ed before his tent,
<PB N="138" REF="028720_0136_0FDA62E2DA6CE480">and among others who had gathered round to &s;ee him, was a corporal, who having been that afternoon too free with aqua vitae, was become as great a man as his maje&s;ty. He had &s;troll|ed up to the &s;pot, and getting within the cir|cle, put him&s;elf in an attitude of con&s;equence, and after having &s;ome time made his ob&s;erva|tions with the air of a profound connoi&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hru&s;ts a quid of tobacco into his mouth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ore it was as fine a creature as ever he &s;aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and as well broke; then tottering up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">om who had been riding it, and was ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ounted, a&s;ked him who was the own|er: At this moment the king came out from his tent, and overhearing the corporal's que&s;|tion, with whom he had already been divert|ed, told him courteou&s;ly, that the hor&s;e was his: The corporal made his maje&s;ty a &s;light compliment by moving his hat, and then &s;et|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing his arms akimbo, told him, that his rea|&s;on for a&s;king was, that he had taken a liking to the hor&s;e and was inclined to buy him. The king told him he had no intention to &s;ell him, but if it would oblige him he would treat with him on the &s;ame &s;pot the next morning. The corporal, thru&s;ting out his hand, cried, a match; to which the king con&s;ented, and rode off, giving private orders that no puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon the corporal, but that he &s;hould be brought before him the next morning. In the morning, when the poor fel|low was told what had pa&s;&s;ed, and conducted to the king's tent, he was &s;eized by a dreadful panick, le&s;t his in&s;olence and drunkenne&s;s might co&s;t him his life. Into the pre&s;ence, however, he was carried; and the king, who
<PB N="139" REF="028720_0137_0FDA62E493BA1838">intended only &s;ome &s;port, a&s;ked him, if he was the man that would la&s;t night have bought his hor&s;e? No, an't plea&s;e your maje&s;ty, &s;ays the fellow, that man went away at three o'clock this morning. Did he &s;o? &s;aid the king (who under&s;tood that at three o'clock, &s;leep had &s;ub&s;tituted a &s;ober man for one that was drunk) I am very glad that I have got &s;o &s;en|&s;ible and decent a per&s;on as you are in his &s;tead, and I hope he will never come back; for if I &s;ee him, I &s;hall certainly re&s;ent his be|haviour. So the corporal was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out farther reprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Killegrew, was a man of very great humour and frequently diverted king Charles II. by his lively &s;pirit of mirth and drollery. He was frequently at court, and had often acce&s;s to king Charles, when admi&s;&s;ion was denied to the fir&s;t peers in the realm. Among&s;t many other merry &s;tories, the following is related of Killegrew. Charles II. who hated bu&s;ine&s;s as much as he loved plea&s;ure, would often di&s;|appoint the council by withdrawing his royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ence when they were met, by which their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s was nece&s;&s;arily delayed, and many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> council much offended at the di&s;re&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to them. It happened one day when the council were met, and had &s;at &s;ome time in expectation of his maje&s;ty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quitted the room in a pa&s;&s;ion, and acci|dentally met with Killegrew, to whom he ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf irreverently of the king: Kil|legrew bade his grace be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alm, for he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he
<PB N="140" REF="028720_0138_0FDA62F4244314C0">would make his maje&s;ty come to council in le&s;s than half an hour. Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of &s;ur|pri&s;e, took him at his word: Kill egrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened; and added, "I know your maje&s;ty hates Lauderdale, though the nece&s;&s;ity of your affairs obliges you to be|have civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man &s;o boundle&s;sly av|aricious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds lo&s;t in this wager, he will hang him|&s;elf, and never plague you any more." The king was plea&s;ed with the archne&s;s of this ob|&s;ervation, and an&s;wered, then Killegrew, I'll po&s;itively go; which he did.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Soi&s;&s;ous in France, who valued him&s;elf on the politene&s;s of his addre&s;s, and was remarkable for never having uttered a rude expre&s;&s;ion, was once, by an indi&s;cretion, guil|ty of a piece of rudene&s;s, &s;ufficient to make his good breeding be called in que&s;tion: And which &s;hews the precaution that is nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed in &s;peaking to &s;trangers. This pre|late was come at court, where ob&s;erving a lady, who was extremely corpulent, talking to the queen, and at the other end of the room a very genteel youth of a very promi&s;ing ap|pearance, both of whom were utter &s;trangers to him, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the young gen|tleman, and with a &s;oft in&s;inuating air, after &s;ome compliments, a&s;ked him if he knew who that Fat Sow was, who was in di&s;cour&s;e with
<PB N="141" REF="028720_0139_0FDA62F5655115D8">her maje&s;ty? Yes, my lord, replied the youth, with great mode&s;ty; that Sow is the amba&s;|&s;adre&s;s of Sweden, and mother to the little pig who has the honour to &s;peak to your lord&s;hip. At this an&s;wer the bi&s;hop was &s;truck with con|fu&s;ion, and humbly begged pardon, adding, that he could not help feeling the greate&s;t e&s;teem for a per&s;on, who had with &s;uch mildne&s;s re|buked him for his brutality.</P>
<P>A few nights &s;ince I was in company (&s;ays the writer) with a gentleman that was in the road of Algiers &s;ome years ago, and was an eye and an ear witne&s;s to the following &s;tory. One day as &s;ome chri&s;tian captives, who had been ran&s;omed, were going to be di&s;charg|ed, the town cruizers brought in a Swedi&s;h ve&s;&s;el; one of them hearing it was of that na|tion, and being from thence him&s;elf, was very de&s;irous to &s;ee the crew, when to his great &s;ur|pri&s;e he &s;aw his own father (who was ma&s;ter of the &s;hip) in the company: The &s;on knew the father, but the father who had lo&s;t him when a youth, knew not his &s;on, having long given him up as dead. The &s;on di&s;covered him|&s;elf, to the father who embraced him with great tenderne&s;s: But the recollection of their &s;itua|tion &s;oon interrupted their joy, and introduced lamentation and de&s;pair.&mdash;At length the young man addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his father in this manner: "The &s;lavery you are going into, will be in&s;upportable to you, and &s;oon put an end to your life, the thoughts of which are wor&s;e than death to me. I have been here a great many years, and know the country, the people and their work; if they will accept of
<PB N="142" REF="028720_0140_0FDA62F6E4CC4DA8">me in your room, I will go back into &s;lavery, and you &s;hall go home again:&mdash;I know if I &s;hould be able to rai&s;e friends, I &s;hall be re|deemed;&mdash;if not&mdash;God's will be done!" The Moors readily accepted the exchange; &s;o the father returned to freedom and his home, and the &s;on to toil and &s;lavery. A memorable in|&s;tance of filial piety.</P>
<P>The vicar of Bray, in Berk&s;hire, being a catholick under the reign of Henry VIII. and a prote&s;tant under Edward VI. a catholick a|gain under queen Mary, and a prote&s;tant in the reign of queen Elizabeth, was reproached as the &s;candal of his gown, by turning from one religion to another; "I cannot help that:" replied the vicar, "but if I changed my religion, I am &s;ure I have kept true to my principle, which is, to live and die the vicar of Bray."</P>
<P>Philips, the noted harlequin, was taken up in London on &s;u&s;picion of debt, and dealt with the officer in the following manner: He fir&s;t called for liquor in abundance, and treated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll about him, to the no &s;mall joy of the bailiff, who was rejoiced to have a calf that bled &s;o well, (as they term it.) Harlequin made the hone&s;t bailiff believe he had &s;ix dozen of wine ready packed up, which he would &s;end for, to drink while in cu&s;tody, and likewife allow him &s;ixpence a bottle for drinking it in his own chamber. Shoulderdab li&s;tened to the propo&s;al with plea&s;ure. The bailiff went to the place, as directed, and returned with joy, to hear that it was to be &s;ent in the morning early. Accordingly it came by a porter, &s;weat|ing
<PB N="143" REF="028720_0141_0FDA62FE720EE548">under his load: The turnkey called to his ma&s;ter, and told him the porter and hamper were come in: Very well, &s;aid he, then let nothing but the porter and hamper out. The porter performed his part very well: Came heavily in with an empty hamper, and &s;eemed to go lightly out, with Philips on his back. He was di&s;hampered at an alehou&s;e on the water &s;ide, cro&s;&s;ed the Thames, and &s;oon after embarked for Ireland. He was very fond of this trick, and would take pride in his project, which was contrived long before he was taken, to be ready on &s;uch an emergency.</P>
