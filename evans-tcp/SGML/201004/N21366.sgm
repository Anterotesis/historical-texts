<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sermons contain the &s;ub|&s;tance of what I have been preaching, for between eight and nine years la&s;t pa&s;t&punc; During that time I have frequently &s;poken in publick, on every &s;ubject in the en&s;uing collection: And I am not con&s;cious, that there is any one point of doctrine, on which I am accu&s;tomed to &s;peak in public, which is not here, incidentally, if not profe&s;&s;edly laid before every Chri&s;tian Reader. Every &s;erious man, who peru&s;es the&s;e will there|fore &s;ee in the cleare&s;t manner, what tho&s;e doctrines are which I embrace and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the e&s;&s;entials of true religion.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="ii" REF="028060_0004_0FD689CB4F7A14F8">
2. But I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible, the&s;e are not propo&s;ed, in &s;uch a manner as &s;ome may expect. Nothing here appears in an elaborate, elegant, or oratorical dre&s;s. If it had been my de&s;ire or de&s;ign to write thus, my lei&s;ure would not permit. But in truth I at pre&s;ent de&s;igned nothing le&s;s; for I now write (as I generally &s;peak) <HI>ad populum:</HI> To the bulk of mankind, to tho&s;e who nei|ther reli&s;h nor under&s;tand the art of &s;peak|ing: But who notwith&s;tanding are compe|tent judges of tho&s;e truths, which are nece&s;|&s;ary to pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. I mention this, that curious readers may &s;pare them&s;elves the labour of &s;eeking for what they will not find.</P>
<P N="3">3. I de&s;ign plain truth for plain people. Therefore of &s;et purpo&s;e I ab&s;tain from all nice and philo&s;ophical &s;peculations, from all perplext and intricate rea&s;onings; and as far as po&s;&s;ible, from even the &s;hew of learn|ing, unle&s;s in &s;ometimes citing the original &s;criptures. I labour to avoid all words which are not ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, all which are not u&s;ed in common life: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd in particular, tho&s;e kind of technical terms, that &s;o frequently occur in bodies of divini|ty, tho&s;e modes of &s;peaking which men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reading are intimately acquainted with, but which to common people are an unknown
<PB N="iii" REF="028060_0005_0FD689CE0291B700">tongue. Yet I am not a&s;&s;ured, that I do not &s;ometimes &s;lide into them unawares: It is &s;o extremely natural to imagine, that a word which is familiar to our&s;elves, is &s;o to all the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nay, my de&s;ign is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to forget all that ever I have read in my life. I mean to &s;peak, in the general, as if I had never read one author, antient or modern (always excepting the in&s;pired.) I am per|&s;uaded, that on the one hand, this may be a means of enabling me more clearly to ex|pre&s;s the &s;entiments of my heart, while I &s;im|ply follow the chain of my own thoughts, without entangling my&s;elf with tho&s;e of other men: And that, on the other, I &s;hall come with fewer weights upon my mind, with le&s;s of prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, either to &s;earch for my&s;elf, or to deliver to others, the naked truths of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="5">5. To candid, rea&s;onable m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> I am not afraid to lay open what have been the inmo&s;t thoughts of my heart. I have thought, "I am a creature of a day, pa&s;&s;ing thro' life, as an arrow through the air. I am a Spirit, come from GOD, and returning to GOD: Ju&s;t hovering over the Great Gulph; till a few moments hence, I am no more &s;een: I drop into an unchangeable eternity! I want
<PB N="iv" REF="028060_0006_0FD689D5F0394A88">to know one thing, the way to Heaven: How to land &s;afe on that happy &s;hore. GOD him&s;elf has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onde&s;cended to teach the way; for this very end he came from Hea|ven. He hath written it down in a book. O give me that book! At any price give me the book of GOD! I have it; Here is know|ledge enough for me. Let me be <HI>Homo unius libri.</HI> Here then I am, far from the bu&s;y ways of men. I &s;it down alone: Only GOD is here. In his pre&s;ence I open, I read his book; for this end, to find the way to Heaven. Is there a doubt concerning the meaning of what I read? Does any thing appear dark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intricate? I lift up my heart to the Father of lights. "Lord, is it not thy word, <HI>If any man lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of</HI> GOD? Thou <HI>give&s;t liberally and upbraide&s;t not;</HI> Thou ha&s;t &s;aid, <HI>If any be willing to do thy will, he &s;hall know.</HI> I am willing to do. Let me know thy will." I then &s;earch af|ter and con&s;ider parallel pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture, <HI>comparing Spiritual things with Spirit|ual.</HI> I meditate thereon, with all the atten|tion and earne&s;tne&s;s of which my mind is capable. If any doubt &s;till remain, I con&s;ult tho&s;e who are experienced in the things of GOD: And then, the writings whereby be|ing dead, they yet &s;peak. And what I thus learn, that I teach.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="v" REF="028060_0007_0FD689DAC7420840">
6. I have accordingly &s;et down in the fol|lowing Sermons, what I find in the bible concerning the way to Heaven; with a view to di&s;tingui&s;h this way of GOD, from all tho&s;e which are the inventions of men. I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe the true, the &s;criptural, experimental religion, &s;o as to omit nothing which is a real part thereof, and to add nothing thereto which is not. And herein it is more e&s;pecially my de&s;ire, fir&s;t, to guard tho&s;e who are ju&s;t &s;etting their faces toward Heaven, (and who having lit|tle acquaintance with the things of GOD, are the more liable to be turned out of the way) from formality, from me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> out&s;ide re|ligion, which has almo&s;t driven heart-reli|on out of the world: And &s;econdly, To warn tho&s;e who know the religion of the heart, the faith which worketh by love, left at any time they make void the law thro' faith, and &s;o fall back into the &s;nare of the Devil.</P>
<P N="7">7. By the advice and at the reque&s;t of &s;ome of my friends, I have prefixt to the other &s;ermons contained in this volume, three &s;ermons of my own and one of my Brother's, preached before the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI> My de&s;ign requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;ome di&s;cour|&s;es on tho&s;e heads. And I preferred the&s;e before any others, as being a &s;tronger an|&s;wer
<PB N="vi" REF="028060_0008_0FD689DDA8CBCD48">than any which can be drawn up now, to tho&s;e who have frequently a&s;&s;erted,&mdash; "That we have changed our doctrine of late, and do not preach now, what we did &s;ome years ago." Any man of under&s;tand|ing may now judge for him&s;elf, when he has compared the latter with the former Ser|mons. But &s;ome may &s;ay, I have mi&s;taken the way my&s;elf, altho' I take upon me to teach it to others. It is po&s;&s;ible, many will think this, and it is very probable, that I have. But I tru&s;t, wherein&s;over I have mi&s;|taken, my mind is open to conviction. I &s;incerely de&s;ire to be better informed. I &s;ay to GOD and man, "What I know not, teach thou me!"</P>
<P N="9">9. Are you per&s;uaded, you &s;ee more clear|ly than me? It is not unlikely that you may. Then, treat me, as you would de&s;ire to be treated your&s;elf upon a change of circum|&s;tances. Point me out a better way than I have yet known. Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> me it is &s;o, by plain proof of &s;cripture. And if I linger in the path I have been accu&s;tomed to tread, and therefore unwilling to leave, labour with me a little, take me by the hand, and lead me as I am able to bear. But be not di&s;plea&s;ed if I entreat you, not to beat me down, in or|der to quicken my pace: I can go but feebly and &s;lowly at be&s;t; then, I &s;hould not be
<PB N="vii" REF="028060_0009_0FD689DF1A9A6108">able to go at all. May I not reque&s;t of you further, not to give me hard names, in or|der to bring me into the right way? Sup|po&s;e I was ever &s;o much in the wrong. I doubt this would not &s;et me right. Rather, it would make me run &s;o much the farther from you, and &s;o get more and more out of the way.</P>
<P N="10">10. Nay, perhaps, if you are angry, &s;o &s;hall I be too; and then there will be &s;mall hopes of finding the truth. If once anger a|ri&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign"> (as <HI>Homer</HI> &s;omewhere expre&s;&s;es it) this &s;moke will &s;o dim the eyes of my &s;oul, that I &s;hall be able to &s;ee nothing clearly. For GOD'S &s;ake, if it be po&s;&s;ible to avoid it, let us not provoke one another to wrath. Let us not kindle in each other this fire of Hell; much le&s;s, blow it up into a flame. If we could di&s;cern truth by that dreadful light, would it not be lo&s;s, rather than gain? For how far is love, even with many wrong opinions, to be preferred before truth it&s;elf without love? We may die without the knowledge of many truths, and yet be car|ried into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bo&s;om. But if we die without love, what will knowledge avail? Ju&s;t as much as it avails the Devil and his Angels!</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="028060_0010_0FD689E0C9F19010">
The GOD of love forbid we &s;hould ever make the trial! May he prepare us for the knowledge of all truth, by filling our hearts with all his love, and with all joy and peace in believing.</P>

<P>By Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. ALL the Ble&s;&s;ings which GOD hath be&s;tow|ed upon Man are of his mere Grace, Bounty or Favour: His Free, unde&s;erved Favour; Favour altogether unde&s;erved; Man having no claim to the lea&s;t of his Mercies. It was free Grace that <HI>formed Man of the Du&s;t of the Ground, and breathed into him a living Soul,</HI> and &s;tamped on that Soul the Image of GOD, and <HI>put all Things under his Feet.</HI> The &s;ame Free Grace continues to us at this Day, Life and Breath, and all Things. For there is nothing we are, or have, or do, which can de&s;erve the lea&s;t Thing at GOD'S Hand. <HI>All our Works thou, O</HI> GOD, <HI>ha&s;t wrought in us.</HI> The&s;e, therefore, are &s;o many more In&s;tances of Free Mercy: And whatever Righteou&s;ne&s;s may be found in Man, this is al&s;o the Gift of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wherewithal then &s;hall a &s;inful Man atone for any the lea&s;t of his Sins? With his own Works? No: Were they ever &s;o many or holy, they are not his own, but GOD'S. But indeed they are all Unholy and Sinful them&s;elves, &s;o that every one of them needs a fre&s;h Atonement. Only corrupt Fruit grows on a corrupt Tree. And his Heart is altogether corrupt and abominable; be|ing <HI>come &s;hort of the Glory of</HI> GOD, the glorious

Therefore, hav|ing nothing, neither Righteou&s;ne&s;s nor Works to plead, his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s utterly &s;topt before</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P>Now, that we fall not &s;hort of the Grace of GOD, it concerns us carefully to enquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. What Faith it is through which we are &s;a|ved?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. What is the Salvation which is through Faith?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. How we may an&s;wer &s;ome Objections.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. What Faith it is through which we are &s;a|ved?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And fir&s;t, It is not barely the Faith of a Heathen. Now GOD requireth of a Heathen to believe, <HI>That</HI> GOD <HI>is; that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him:</HI> and that he is to be &s;ought by <HI>glorifying him as</HI> GOD, <HI>by giving him Thanks</HI> for all Things; and by a careful Practice of Moral Virtue, of Ju&s;tice, Mercy and Truth toward their Fellow Creatures. A <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Ro|man</HI> therefore, yea a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ythi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> or <HI>Indian,</HI> was with|out Excu&s;e if he did not believe thus much. The Being and Attributes of GOD, a future State
<PB N="13" REF="028060_0014_0FD689EEE27EAC58">of Reward and Puni&s;hment, and the obligatory Nature of Moral Virtue. For this is barely the Faith of a Heathen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor, 2dly, Is it the Faith of a Devil, tho' this goes much farther than that of a Heathen. For the Devil believes, not only, that there is a wi&s;e and powerful GOD, Gracious to reward, and Ju&s;t to puni&s;h, but al&s;o, that JESUS is the Son of GOD, the CHRIST, the SAVIOUR of the World. So we find him declaring, in expre&s;s Terms, <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 34. <HI>I know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of</HI> GOD. Nor can we doubt but that unhappy Spirit believes all tho&s;e Words, which came out of the Mouth of the Holy One; yea, and what&s;oever el&s;e was written by tho&s;e Holy Men of old; of two of whom he was compelled to give that glorious Te&s;timony, <HI>The&s;e men are the Servants of the mo&s;t high</HI> GOD, <HI>who &s;hew unto you the Way of Salvation.</HI> Thus much then the great Enemy of GOD and Man believes, and trembles in believing, That GOD <HI>was made manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h;</HI> That he will <HI>tread all Enemies under his Feet,</HI> and that <HI>all Scripture was given by In&s;pi|ration of</HI> GOD. Thus far goeth the Faith of a Devil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Faith through which we are &s;aved, in that Sen&s;e of the Word which will here|after be explained, is not barely that which the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves had while CHRIST was yet upon Earth; tho' they &s;o believed on him as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>leave all and follow him;</HI> altho' they had then Power to work Miracles, to <HI>heal all manner of Sickne&s;s, and all Manner of Di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> yea, they had then <HI>Power and Authority over all Devils:</HI> And which is beyond all this, were &s;ent by their Ma&s;ter to <HI>preach the Kingdom of</HI> GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="14" REF="028060_0015_0FD689F24E770890">
4. What Faith is it then through which we are &s;aved? It may be an&s;wered, fir&s;t, in general, It is a Faith in CHRIST; CHRIST, and GOD through CHRIST, are the proper Object of it. Herein therefore, it is &s;ufficiently, ab&s;olutely, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Faith either of ancient or modern Heathens. And from the Faith of a De|vil, it is fully di&s;tingui&s;hed by this, It is not barely a Speculative, Rational Thing, a cold, lifele&s;s A&s;&s;ent, a Train of Ideas in the Head; but al&s;o a Di&s;po&s;ition of the Heart. For thus &s;aith the Scripture, <HI>With the Heart, Man believeth unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And, <HI>If thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy Mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe with thy</HI> Heart, <HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>hath rai&s;ed Him from the Dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. And herein does it differ from that Faith which the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves had while our Lord was on Earth, that it acknowledges the Nece&s;&s;ity and Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Re|&s;urrection. It acknowledges his death as the only &s;ufficient Means of redeeming Man from Death Eternal; and his Re&s;urrection as the Re&s;toration of us all to Life and Immortality: Ina&s;much as <HI>he was delivered for our Sins, and ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification.</HI> Chri&s;tian Faith is then, not only an A&s;&s;ent to the whole Go&s;pel of CHRIST, but al&s;o a full Reliance on the Blood of CHRIST, a Tru&s;t in the Merits of his Life, Death, and Re|&s;urrection; a Recumbency upon him as our atone|ment and our Life; <HI>as given for us,</HI> and <HI>living in us.</HI> It is a &s;ure Confidence which a Man hath in GOD, that through the Merits of CHRIST, <HI>his</HI> Sins are forgiven, and <HI>he</HI> reconciled to the Favour of GOD; and in con&s;equence hereof, a clo&s;ing with him, and cleaving to him, as <HI>our Wi&s;dom&punc;
<PB N="15" REF="028060_0016_0FD689F4F1398448">Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, Redemption,</HI> or in one Word our <HI>Salvation.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">II. What Salvation it is, which is through this Faith, is the &s;econd Thing to be con&s;idered.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And fir&s;t, What&s;oever el&s;e it imply, it is a Pre&s;ent Salvation. It is &s;omething attainable, yea, actually attained on Earth, by tho&s;e who are Par|takers of this Faith. For thus &s;aith the Apo&s;tle to the Believers at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and in them to the Be|lievers of all Ages, not Ye &s;hall be (tho' that al&s;o is true) but <HI>ye</HI> are <HI>&s;aved through Faith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Ye are &s;aved</HI> (to comprize all in one Word) from Sin. This is the Salvation which is through Faith. This is that great Salvation foretold by the Angel, before GOD brought his fir&s;t begotten into the World, <HI>Thou &s;halt call his Name</HI> JESUS, <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his People from their Sins.</HI> And neither here, nor in other Parts of Holy Writ, is there any Limitation or Re&s;triction. All his People, or, as it is el&s;ewhere expre&s;&s;ed, all that believe in him, he will &s;ave from all their Sins; from Original and Actual, Pa&s;t and Pre&s;ent Sin, of the Fle&s;h and of the Spirit. Through Faith that is in him, they are &s;aved both from the Guilt and from the Power of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Fir&s;t from the Guilt of all Pa&s;t Sin. For whereas <HI>all the World is guilty before</HI> GOD; in&s;o|much that &s;hould he <HI>be extreme to mark what is done ami&s;s, there is none that could abide it:</HI> And whereas <HI>by the Law is only the Knowledge of Sin,</HI> but no Deliverance from it; &s;o that <HI>by fulfilling the Deeds of the Law, no Fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified in his Sight: Now the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> GOD, <HI>which is by Faith of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>is manife&s;ted unto all that believe.</HI> Now <HI>they are ju&s;tified freely by
<PB N="16" REF="028060_0017_0FD689F4F7499080">his Grace, through the Redemption that is in</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Him</HI> GOD <HI>hath &s;et forth to be a Propi|tiation through Faith in his Blood; To declare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s for</HI> (or by) <HI>the Remi&s;&s;ion of the Sins that are pa&s;t.</HI> Now hath CHRIST <HI>taken away the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us.</HI> He hath <HI>blotted out the Hand-writing that was again&s;t us, taking it out of the Way, nailing it to his Cro&s;s. There is therefore no Condemnation now, to them which</HI> believe <HI>in</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. And being &s;aved from Guilt, they are &s;aved from Fear. Not indeed from a filial Fear of of|fending, but from all &s;ervile Fear, from that <HI>Fear which hath Torment,</HI> from Fear of Puni&s;h|ment, from Fear of the Wrath of GOD; whom they now no longer regard as a &s;evere Ma&s;ter, but as an indulgent Father. <HI>They have not received again the Spirit of Bondage; but the Spirit of adop|tion, whereby they cry, Abba, Father: The Spirit it|&s;elf al&s;o bearing Witne&s;s with their Spirits, that they are the Children of</HI> GOD. They are al&s;o &s;aved from the Fear, tho' not from the Po&s;&s;ibility, of falling away from the Grace of GOD, and com|ing &s;hort of the great and precious Promi&s;es: They are <HI>&s;ealed with the Holy Spirit of Promi&s;e, which is the Earne&s;t of their Inheritance.</HI> (Eph. i. 13.) Thus have they <HI>Peace with</HI> GOD <HI>through our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>They rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</HI> GOD. <HI>And the love of</HI> GOD <HI>is &s;hed abroad in their Hearts, through the Holy Gho&s;t, which is given unto them.</HI> And hereby they are <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> (tho' perhaps not all at all Times, nor with the &s;ame Fulne&s;s of Per&s;ua&s;ion) that <HI>neither Death nor Life, nor Things pre&s;ent, nor Things to come, nor Heighth nor Depth, nor any other Creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate them from

<ITEM>5. Again, through this Faith they are &s;aved from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt of it. So the Apo&s;tle declares. <HI>Ye know that he was manife&s;ted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin. Who&s;oever abideth in him &s;inneth not.</HI> (Chap. iii. 5, &amp;c.) Again, <HI>Little Children, let no Man de|ceive you.&mdash;He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.&mdash; Who&s;oever believeth is born of</HI> GOD. <HI>And who&s;oever is born of</HI> GOD <HI>doth not commit Sin, for his Seed re|maineth in him: And he cannot Sin, becau&s;e he is born of</HI> GOD. Once more, <HI>We know that What&s;oever is born of</HI> God <HI>&s;inneth not: But he that is begotten of</HI> God, <HI>keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked one toucheth him not,</HI> Chap. v. 18.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He that is by Faith born of God, &s;inneth not,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By any habitual Sin: For all habitual Sin, is Sin reigning. But Sin cannot reign in any that believeth. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By any wilful Sin, for his Will, while he abideth in the Faith is utterly &s;et again&s;t all Sin, and abhorreth it as deadly Poi&s;on. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By any &s;inful De&s;ire; for he continually de&s;ireth the Holy and Perfect Will of God; and any Tendency to an Unholy De&s;ire, he by the Grace of God, &s;tifleth in the Birth. Nor,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4, Doth he &s;in by Infirmities, whether in Act, Word, or Thought. For his Infirmities have no Concurrence of his Will; and without This they are not properly Sins. Thus, <HI>He that is born of</HI> God <HI>doth not commit Sin.</HI> And tho' he cannot &s;ay, <HI>He hath not &s;inned,</HI> yet now, <HI>he &s;in|neth not.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. This then is the Salvation which is through Faith, even in the pre&s;ent World: A Salvation from Sin, and the Con&s;equences of Sin, both often expre&s;&s;ed in the Word <HI>Ju&s;tification;</HI> which, taken
<PB N="18" REF="028060_0019_0FD689F7DF9A8BB0">in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, implies, A Deliverance from Guilt and Puni&s;hment, by the Atonement of CHRIST actually applied to the Soul of the Sin|ner now believing on him, and a Deliverance from the whole Body of Sin through CHRIST <HI>formed in his Heart.</HI> So that he who is thus ju&s;ti|fied or &s;aved by Faith, is indeed <HI>born again.</HI> He is <HI>born again of the Spirit</HI> unto a new <HI>Life, which is hid with Chri&s;t in</HI> God. <HI>He is a new Creature: Old Things are pa&s;t away: All Things in him are become new.</HI> And as a <HI>new-born Babe he gladly receives the</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>&s;incere Milk of the Word, and grows thereby: Going on in the Might of the Lord his</HI> God, <HI>from Faith to Faith, from Grace to Grace, until at Length he come unto a perfect Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="3">III. The fir&s;t u&s;ual Objection to this is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That to preach Salvation or Ju&s;tification by Faith only, is to preach again&s;t Holine&s;s and Good Works. To which a &s;hort An&s;wer might be given: It would be &s;o, if we &s;pake, as &s;ome do, of a Faith which was &s;eparate from the&s;e. But we &s;peak of a Faith which is not &s;o, but nece&s;&s;arily productive of all Good Works and all Holine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But it may be of u&s;e to con&s;ider it more at large: E&s;pecially &s;ince it is no new Objection, but as old as St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Time; for even then it was a&s;ked, <HI>Do we not make void the Law through Faith?</HI> We an&s;wer, fir&s;t, All who preach not Faith, do manife&s;tly make void the Law; either directly and gro&s;ly by Limitations and Comments, that eat out all the Spirit of the Text: Or indirectly, by not pointing out the only Means whereby it is po&s;&s;ible to perform it. Whereas, &s;econdly, <HI>We e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="19" REF="028060_0020_0FD689F95AD4D9C8">the Law;</HI> both by &s;hewing its full Extent, and Spiritual Meaning: And by calling all to that living Way, whereby <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law may be fulfilled in them.</HI> The&s;e, while they tru&s;t in the Blood of CHRIST alone, u&s;e all the Ordi|nances which he hath appointed, do all the <HI>Good Works which he had before prepared that they &s;hould walk therein,</HI> and enjoy and manife&s;t all holy and heavenly Tempers, even the &s;ame <HI>Mind that was in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But does not preaching this Faith lead Men into Pride? We an&s;wer, Accidentally it may. Therefore ought every Believer to be earne&s;tly cau|tioned, (in the Words of the Great Apo&s;tle) <HI>Be|cau&s;e of Unbelief, the fir&s;t Branches were broken off; and thou &s;tande&s;t by Faith. Be not high minded, but fear. If</HI> God <HI>&s;pared not the Natural Branches, take heed le&s;t he &s;pare not Thee. Behold, therefore, the Goodne&s;s and Severity of</HI> God! <HI>On them which fell, Severity: But towards thee, Goodne&s;s: If thou continue in his Goodne&s;s; otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o &s;halt be cut off.</HI> And while he continues therein, he will remember tho&s;e Words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> fore&s;ee|ing and an&s;wering this very Objection, (<HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 27) <HI>Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</HI> If a Man were ju&s;tified by his Works, he would have whereof to glory. But there is no glorying for him, <HI>that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly,</HI> (Rom. iv.) To the &s;ame Effect, are the Words both preceed|ing and following the Text, (<HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 4, &amp;c.) God, <HI>who is rich in Mercy,&mdash;even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickened us together with</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>(by Grace ye are &s;aved) &mdash; that he might &s;lew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kind|ne&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="028060_0021_0FD689FADD0B2670">towards us through</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>For by Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith. And that not of your&s;elves.</HI> Of your&s;elves cometh neither your Faith nor your Salvation. <HI>It is the Gift of</HI> God; the free, unde&s;erved Gift, the Faith thro' which ye are &s;aved, as well as the Salvation, which he of his own good Plea&s;ure, his mere Favour, an|nexes thereto. That ye believe, is one In&s;tance of his Grace; that believing ye are &s;aved, another. <HI>Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI> For all our Works, all our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which were before our Believing, merited nothing of God but Condemnation. So far were they from de|&s;erving Faith; which therefore, whenever given, is not <HI>of Works.</HI> Neither is Salvation of the Works we do when we believe. For <HI>it is</HI> then God <HI>that worketh in us.</HI> And therefore, that he giveth us a Reward for what he him&s;elf worketh, only commendeth the Riches of his Mercy, but leaveth us nothing whereof to glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. However, may not the &s;peaking thus of the Mercy of God, as &s;aving or ju&s;tifying freely by Faith only, encourage Men in Sin? Indeed it may and will; many <HI>will continue in Sin that Grace may abound.</HI> But their Blood is upon their own Head. The Goodne&s;s of God ought to lead them to Repentance, and &s;o it will tho&s;e who are &s;incere of Heart. When they know there is yet Forgivene&s;s with him, they will cry aloud that he would blot out their Sins al&s;o, thro' Faith which is in Je&s;us. And if they earne&s;tly cry, and faint not, if they &s;eek him in all the Means he hath appointed, if they refu&s;e to be comforted till he come, <HI>he will come and will not tarry.</HI> And he can do much Work in a &s;hort Time. Many are the Examples in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, of
<PB N="21" REF="028060_0022_0FD68A029F0EE998">God's &s;hedding abroad this Faith in Men's Hearts, even like Lightning falling from Heaven. So in the &s;ame Hour that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> began to preach, the Jailor <HI>repented, believed, and was baptized:</HI> As were three Thou&s;and by St. <HI>Peter</HI> on the Day of Penteco&s;t, who all repented and believed at his fir&s;t Preaching. And ble&s;&s;ed be God, there are now many living Proofs, that he is &s;till <HI>mighty to &s;ave.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Yet to the &s;ame Truth, placed in another View, a quite contrary Objection is made: <Q>If a Man cannot be &s;aved by all that he can do, this will drive Men to De&s;pair.</Q> True, to de&s;pair of being &s;aved by their own Works, their own Merits or Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And &s;o it ought; for none can tru&s;t in the Merits of Chri&s;t, till he has utterly renounced his own. He that <HI>goeth about to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> can|not receive the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith cannot be given him, while he tru&s;teth in that which is of the Law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. But this, it is &s;aid, is an uncomfortable Doctrine. The Devil &s;poke like him&s;elf, that is, without either Truth or Shame, when he dared to &s;ugge&s;t to Men that it is &s;uch. 'Tis the only comfortable one, 'tis <HI>very full of Comfort,</HI> to all &s;elf-de&s;troy'd, &s;elf-condemn'd Sinners. That <HI>who|&s;oever believeth on him &s;hall not be a&s;hamed:</HI> That <HI>the &s;ame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him:</HI> Here is Comfort, high as Heaven, &s;tronger than Death! What! Mercy for all? For <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> a Public Robber? For <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> a Common Harlot? Methinks I hear one &s;ay, Then I, even I, may hope for Mercy! And &s;o thou may'&s;t, thou afflicted one, whom
<PB N="22" REF="028060_0023_0FD68A03C0A48530">none hath comforted! God will not ca&s;t out thy Prayer.

<ITEM>7. When no more Objections occur, then we are &s;imply told, That Salvation by Faith only, ought not to be preached as the fir&s;t Doctrine, or at lea&s;t not to be preached to All. But what &s;aith the Holy Gho&s;t? <HI>Other Foundation can no Man lay, than that which is laid, even</HI> JESUS CHRIST.

"Well, but not to all." To whom then are we not to preach it? Whom &s;hall we except? The Poor? Nay, they have a peculiar Right to have the Go&s;pel preached unto them. The unlearned? No. God hath revealed the&s;e Things unto un|learned and ignorant Men from the Beginning. The Young? By no Means. <HI>Suffer the&s;e</HI> in any wi&s;e to <HI>come unto</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>and forbid them not.</HI> The Sinners? Lea&s;t of all. <HI>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI> Why then, if any, we are to except the Rich, the Learned, the Reputable, the Moral Men. And
<PB N="23" REF="028060_0024_0FD68A04B96ACE88">'tis true, they too often except them&s;elves from hearing; yet we mu&s;t &s;peak the Words of our Lord.

But &s;till, <HI>as the Lord liveth, what&s;oever the Lord &s;aith unto us, That we will &s;peak.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. At this Time more e&s;pecially will we &s;peak, That <HI>by Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith:</HI> Be|cau&s;e never was the maintaining this Doctrine more &s;ea&s;onable than it is at this Day. Nothing but this can effectually prevent the Increa&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Delu&s;ion among us. 'Tis endle&s;s to attack one by one, all the Errors of that Church.

It was this Doctrine, (which our Church ju&s;tly calls <HI>the &s;trong Rock and Fountain of the Chri&s;tian Religion</HI>) that fir&s;t drove Popery out of the&s;e Kingdoms, and 'tis this alone can keep it out. Nothing but this can give a Check to that Immorality, which hath <HI>over&s;pread the Land as a Flood.</HI> Can you empty the great Deep, Drop by Drop? Then you may reform us, by Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from particular Vices. But let the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of</HI> God <HI>by Faith</HI> be brought in, and &s;o &s;hall its proud Waves be &s;tayed. Nothing but this can &s;top the Mouths of tho&s;e who <HI>glory in their Shame, and openly deny the Lord that bought them.</HI> They can talk as &s;ublimely of the Law, as he that hath it written by God in his Heart. To hear them &s;peak on this Head, might incline one to think, they were not far from the Kingdom of God. But take them out of the Law into the Go&s;pel; begin with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith, <HI>with</HI>

<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What is implied in being <HI>almo&s;t,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> What in being <HI>altogether a Chri&s;tian.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I.) 1. Now, in the being <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian</HI> is implied, fir&s;t Heathen Hone&s;ty. No one, I &s;uppo&s;e, will make any Que&s;tion of this; e&s;pe|cially, &s;ince by Heathen Hone&s;ty here, I mean, not that which is recommended in the Writings of their Philo&s;ophers only, but &s;uch as the com|mon Heathens expected of one another, and many of them actually practi&s;ed. By the Rules of this they were taught, that they ought not to be un|ju&s;t; not to take away their Neighbour's Goods, either by Robbery or Theft: Not to oppre&s;s the Poor, neither to u&s;e Extortion toward any: Not to cheat or over-reach either the Poor or Rich, in what&s;oever Commerce they had with them:
<PB N="30" REF="028060_0029_0FD68A0DDB80CD50">To defraud no Man of his Right, and, if it were po&s;&s;ible to owe no Man any Thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, the common Heathens allowed, that &s;ome Regard was to be paid to Truth as well as to Ju&s;tice. And accordingly, they not only held him in Abomination, who was for&s;worn, who called God to witne&s;s to a Lie; but him al&s;o, who was known to be a Slanderer of his Neighbour, who fal&s;ely accu&s;ed any Man. And indeed little better did they e&s;teem wilful Liars of any Sort, ac|counting them the Di&s;grace of Human Kind, and the Pe&s;ts of Society.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet again, there was a Sort of Love and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they expected one from another. They expected whatever a&s;&s;i&s;tance any one could give another, without Prejudice to him&s;elf. And this they extended, not only to tho&s;e little Offices of Humanity, which are performed without any Expen&s;e or Labour; but likewi&s;e, to the Feed|ing the Hungry, if they had Food to &s;pare, the clothing the Naked, with their own &s;uperfluous Raiment; and in general, the giving to any that needed, &s;uch Things as they needed not them|&s;elves. Thus far (in the lowe&s;t Account of it) Heathen Hone&s;ty went, the fir&s;t Thing implied in the being <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II.) 4. A &s;econd Thing implied in the being <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian,</HI> is the having a Form of God|line&s;s, of that Godline&s;s which is pre&s;cribed in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: The having the <HI>Out&s;ide of a real Chri&s;tian.</HI> Accordingly, the <HI>Almo&s;t Chri|&s;tian</HI> does nothing which the Go&s;pel forbids. He taketh not the Name of God in vain: He ble&s;|&s;eth and cur&s;eth not; he &s;weareth not at all, but his Communication is yea, yea; nay, nay. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> profanes not the Day of the Lord, nor &s;uffers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

He not only avoids all actual Adultery, Fornication, and Uncleanne&s;s, but every Word or Look, that either directly or in|directly tends thereto: Nay, and all idle Words, ab&s;taining both from all Detraction, Backbiting, Tale bearing, Evil &s;peaking, and from <HI>all fooli&s;h Talking and Je&s;ting,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, a kind of Virtue in the Heathen Morali&s;t's Account. Briefly from all Conver&s;ation that is not <HI>good to the U&s;e of edify|ing,</HI> and that con&s;equently <HI>grieves the Holy Spirit of</HI> God, <HI>whereby we are &s;ealed to the Day of Re|demption.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. He ab&s;tains from <HI>Wine wherein is Exce&s;s,</HI> from Revelling and Gluttony. He avoids, as much as in him lies, all Strife and Contention, continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all Men. And if he &s;uffer wrong, he avengeth not him&s;elf, neither returns Evil for Evil. He is no Railer, no Brawler, no Scoffer, either at the Faults or Infirmities of his Neighbour. He does not willingly wrong, hurt, or grieve any Man; but in all Things acts and &s;peaks by that plain Rule, <HI>What&s;oever thou would&s;t not be &s;hould do unto thee, that do not thou to another.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And in doing Good, he does not confine him&s;elf to cheap and ea&s;y Offices of Kindne&s;s, but labours and &s;uffers for the Profit of many, that by all Means he may help &s;ome. In &s;pite of Toil or Pain, <HI>What&s;oever his Hand findeth to do, he doeth it with all his Might:</HI> Whether it be for his Friends, or for his Enemies; for the Evil, or for the Good. For, being <HI>not &s;lothful in this,</HI> or in any <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s, as he hath Opportunity he doth Good,</HI> all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er of Good <HI>to all Men;</HI> and to their Souls as well as their Bodies.

<P N="3">III.) 9. By Sincerity, I mean, a real, inward Principle of Religion, from whence the&s;e outward Actions flow. And indeed, if we have not this, we have not Heathen Hone&s;ty; no, not &s;o much of it as will an&s;wer the demand of a <HI>Heathen, Epi|curean Poet.</HI> Even this poor Wretch, in his &s;ober Intervals, is able to te&s;tify,

So that if a Man only ab&s;tains from doing Evil, in order to avoid Puni&s;hment,

<P N="10">10.

This De&s;ign, if any Man be <HI>al|mo&s;t a Chri&s;tian,</HI> runs through the whole Tenor of his Life. This is the moving Principle both in his doing Good, his ab&s;taining from Evil, and his u&s;ing the Ordinances of God.</P>
<P N="11">11. But here it will probably be enquired, Is it po&s;&s;ible that any Man living, &s;hould go &s;o far as this, and neverthele&s;s be <HI>only almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian?</HI> What more than this can be implied, in the being <HI>a Chri&s;tian altogether?</HI> I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, That it is po&s;&s;ible to go thus far, and yet be but <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian;</HI> I learn not only from the Oracles of God, but al&s;o from the &s;ure Te&s;timony of Expe|rience.</P>

<P N="13">13. I did go thus far for many Years, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of this Place can te&s;tify: U&s;ing Diligence to e&s;chew
<PB N="35" REF="028060_0034_0FD68A1B177416E0">all Evil, and to have a Con&s;cience void of Offence: Redeeming the Time, buying up every Oppor|tunity of doing all Good to all Men; con&s;tantly and carefully u&s;ing all the Public and all the Pri|vate Means of Grace; endeavouring after a &s;teady Seriou&s;ne&s;s of Behaviour, at all Times and in all Places: And God is my Record, before whom I &s;tand, doing all this in Sincerity; having a real De&s;ign to &s;erve God, a hearty De&s;ire to do his Will in all Things, to plea&s;e him who had called me to <HI>fight the good Fight,</HI> and to <HI>lay hold of eternal Life.</HI> Yet my own Con&s;cience beareth me Wit|ne&s;s in the Holy Gho&s;t, that all this Time I was but <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. If it be enquired, what more than this is implied in the being <HI>altogether a Chri&s;tian?</HI> I an|&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">I.) 1. Fir&s;t, The Love of God. For thus &s;aith his Word, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy</HI> God, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength:</HI> Such a Love of God is this, as engro&s;&s;es the whole Heart, as takes up all the Affections, as fills the entire Capacity of the Soul, and employs the ut|mo&s;t Extent of all its Faculties. He that thus loves the Lord his God, his Spirit continually <HI>rejoiceth in</HI> God <HI>his Saviour.</HI> His <HI>Delight</HI> in <HI>in the Lord, his</HI> Lord and his All, to whom <HI>in every Thing he giveth Thanks. All</HI> his <HI>De&s;ire is unto</HI> God, <HI>and the Remembrance of his Name.</HI> His Heart is ever crying out, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide Thee.</HI> Indeed, what can he de&s;ire be&s;ide God? Not the World, or the Things of the World. For he is <HI>crucified to the World, and the
<PB N="36" REF="028060_0035_0FD68A1C996CD9A0">World crucified to him.</HI> He is crucified to the De&s;ire of the Fle&s;h, the De&s;ire of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. Yea, he is dead to Pride of every Kind: For <HI>Love is not puffed up;</HI> but he that dwelleth in Love <HI>dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> is le&s;s than nothing in his own Eyes.</P>
<P N="2">II.) 2. The Second Thing implied in the be|ing <HI>altogether a Chri&s;tian</HI> is, The Love of our Neighbour. For thus &s;aid our Lord in the fol|lowing Words, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> If any Man a&s;k who is my Neighbour, we reply, Every Man in the World; every Child of his, who is <HI>the Father of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h.</HI> Nor may we in any wi&s;e except our Ene|mies, or the Enemies of God and their own Souls. But every Chri&s;tian loveth the&s;e al&s;o as him&s;elf, yea, <HI>as Chri&s;t loved us.</HI> He that would more fully under&s;tand what Manner of Love this is, may con&s;ider St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s De&s;cription of it. It is, <HI>long &s;uffering and kind. It envieth not. It is not ra&s;h or ha&s;ty in judging. It is not puffed up,</HI> but maketh him that loves, the lea&s;t, the Servant of all. Love <HI>doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly,</HI> but <HI>becometh all Things to all Men.</HI> She <HI>&s;eeketh not her own,</HI> but only the Good of others, that they may be &s;aved. Love <HI>is not provoked.</HI> It ca&s;teth out Wrath, which he who hath, is not <HI>made perfect in Laws.</HI> It <HI>thinketh no Evil.</HI> It <HI>rejoiceth not in Ini|quity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</HI> It <HI>cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth all Things believeth all Things, hopeth all Things, endu|reth all Things.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 3. There is yet one Thing more that may be &s;eparately con&s;idered, tho' it cannot actually be &s;eparate from the preceding, which is im|plied in the being <HI>altogether a Chri&s;tian.</HI> And
<PB N="37" REF="028060_0036_0FD68A1E56FE17D8">that is the Ground of All, even Faith. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry ex|cellent Things are &s;poken of this throughout the Oracles of God. <HI>Every one,</HI> &s;aith the beloved Di&s;ciple, <HI>that believeth, is born of</HI> God. <HI>To as many us received him, gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> And, <HI>this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</HI> Yea, our Lord him&s;elf declares, <HI>He that believeth in the Son hath everla&s;ting Life; and co|meth not into Condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But here let no Man deceive his own Soul. "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homily on the Salvation of Man.</NOTE> It is diligently to be noted, the Faith which bringeth not forth Repentance and Love, and all good Works, is not that right living Faith which is here &s;poken of, but a dead and devili&s;h one. For even the Devils believe that Chri&s;t was born of a Virgin, that he wrought all kinds of Miracles, declaring him&s;elf very God: That for our Sakes he &s;uffered a mo&s;t painful Death, to redeem us from Death everla&s;ting: That he ro&s;e again the third Day; that he a&s;cended into Hea|ven, and &s;itteth at the Right Hand of the Fa|ther, and at the End of the World, &s;hall come a|gain to judge both the Quick and Dead. The&s;e Articles of our Faith the Devils believe, and &s;o they believe all that is written in the Old and New Te&s;tament. And yet for all this Faith, they be but Devils. They remain &s;till in their damnable E&s;tate, lacking the very true Chri&s;tian Faith."</P>
<P N="5">5. "The right and true Chri&s;tian Faith is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o go on in the Words of our own Church, not on|ly to believe that holy Scripture, and the Articles of our Faith are true, but al&s;o to have a &s;ure
<PB N="38" REF="028060_0037_0FD68A2302DDEEB8">Tru&s;t and Confidence, to be &s;aved from ever|la&s;ting Damnation by Chri&s;t. It is a &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confidence which a Man hath in God, that by the Merits of Chri&s;t his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven, and he reconciled to the Favour of God,&mdash;whereof doth follow a loving Heart, to obey his Com|mandments."</P>
<P N="6">6. Now, who&s;oever has this Faith, which <HI>pu|rifies the Heart,</HI> by the Power of God, who <HI>dwelleth therein,</HI> from Pride, Anger, De&s;ire, <HI>from all Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> from <HI>all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit,</HI> whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fills it with Love &s;tronger than Death, both to God and to all Mankind; Love that doth the Works of God, glorying to &s;pend and to be &s;pent for all Men, and that endureth with Joy, not only the Reproach of Chri&s;t, the being mocked, de&s;pi&s;ed, and hated of all Men, but what&s;oever the Wi&s;dom of God permits the Malice of Men or Devils to inflict; who&s;o|ever has this <HI>Faith,</HI> thus <HI>working by Love,</HI> is not <HI>almo&s;t only, but altogether a Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. But who are the living Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e Things? I be&s;eech you, Brethren, as in the Pre|&s;ence of that God, before whom <HI>Hell and De|&s;truction are without a Covering: How much more the Hearts of the Children of Men?</HI> That ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of you would a&s;k his own Heart, "Am I of that Number? Do I &s;o far practi&s;e Ju&s;tice, Mercy and Truth, as even the Rules of Heathen Hone&s;ty require? If &s;o, have I the very <HI>Out&s;ide</HI> of a Chri&s;tian? The Form of Godline&s;s? Do I ab&s;tain from Evil, from what&s;oever is forbidden in the written word of God? Do I, whatever Good my Hand findeth to do, do it with my Might? Do I &s;eriou&s;ly u&s;e all the Ordinances of
<PB N="39" REF="028060_0038_0FD68A2784EC9AD8">God at all Opportunities? And is all this done, with a &s;incere De&s;ign and De&s;ire to plea&s;e God in all Things?</P>
<P N="8">8. Are not many of you con&s;cious, that you never came thus far: That you have not been even <HI>almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian?</HI> That you have not come up to the Standard of Heathen Hone&s;ty? At lea&s;t, not to the Form of Chri&s;tian Godli|ne&s;s? Much le&s;s hath God &s;een Sincerity in you, a real De&s;ign of plea&s;ing him in all Things. You never &s;o much as intended, to devote all your Words and Works, your Bu&s;ine&s;s, Studies, Di|ver&s;ions, to his Glory. You never even de|&s;igned or de&s;ired, that what&s;oever you did, &s;hould be <HI>done in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> and, as &s;uch, &s;hould be <HI>a &s;piritual Sacrifice, acceptable to God through Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. But &s;uppo&s;ing you had, Do good De&s;igns and good De&s;ires make a Chri&s;tian? By no Means, unle&s;s they are brought to good Effect. <Q>Hell is paved, &s;aith one, with good Inten|tions.</Q> The great Que&s;tion of all then &s;till remains. Is the Love of God &s;hed abroad in your Heart? Can you cry out, <Q>My God and my All?</Q> Do you de&s;ire nothing but him? Are you happy in God? Is he your Glory, your Delight, your Crown of Rejoicing? And is this Commandment written in your Heart, That he who loveth God loves his Brother al&s;o? Do you then love your Neighbour as your&s;elf? Do you love every Man, even your Enemies, even the Enemies of God, as your own Soul? As Chri&s;t loved you? Yea, do&s;t thou believe that Chri&s;t loved <HI>thee,</HI> and gave him&s;elf for thee? Ha&s;t thou Faith in his Blood? Believe&s;t thou the
<PB N="40" REF="028060_0039_0FD68A28A170CA80">Lamb of God hath taken away <HI>thy</HI> Sins, and ca&s;t them as a Stone into the Depth of the Sea? That he hath blotted out the Hand-writing that was again&s;t <HI>thee,</HI> taking it out of the Way, nailing it to his Cro&s;s? Ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> indeed Redemption through his Blood, even the Remi&s;&s;ion of <HI>thy</HI> Sins? And doth his Spirit bear witne&s;s with <HI>thy</HI> Spirit, that thou art a Child of God?</P>
<P N="10">10. The God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who now &s;tandeth in the Mid&s;t of us, knoweth that if any Man die without this Faith and this Love, good it were for him that he had never been born.

Let him not re&s;t, till he <HI>make his Goodne&s;s to pa&s;s before thee, till he proclaim unto thee the Name of the Lord.

<ITEM>1. And fir&s;t, as to the Sleepers here &s;poken to. By Sleep is &s;ignified the Natural State of Man: That deep Sleep of the Soul into which the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> hath ca&s;t all who &s;pring from his Loins; that Supinene&s;s, Indolence, and Stupi|dity, that In&s;en&s;ibility of his real Condition, where|in every Man comes into the World, and con|tinues till the Voice of God awakes him.</ITEM>

He &s;ees <HI>no Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for <HI>the one Thing needful,</HI> even that inward univer&s;al Change, that <HI>Birth from above</HI> (figured out by Bapti&s;m) which is the Beginning of that total Renovation, that Sanctification of Spirit, Soul and Body, <HI>without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Full of all Di&s;ea&s;es as he is, he fancies him&s;elf in perfect Health: Fa&s;t bound in Mi&s;ery and Iron, he dreams that he is happy, and at Li|berty. He &s;ays, Peace, Peace, while the Devil, <HI>as a &s;trong Man armed,</HI> is in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul. He &s;leeps on &s;till, and takes his Re&s;t, tho' Hell is moved from beneath to meet him; tho' the Pit, from whence there is no Return, hath opened its Mouth to &s;wallow him up: A Fire is kindled around him, yet he knoweth it not; yea it burns him, yet he lays it not to Heart.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> On what Terms they are ju&s;tified.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I am, fir&s;t, to &s;hew, What is the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">round of this whole Doctrine of Ju&s;tification. 1. In the Image of God was Man made, ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he that created him is holy; merciful as the Author of all is merciful, perfect as his Fa|ther in Heaven is perfect. As God is Love, &s;o Man dwelling in Love, dwelt in God, and God in him. God made him to be <HI>an Image of his own Eternity,</HI> an incorruptible Picture of the God of Glory. He was accordingly pure, as God is pure, from every Spot of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. He knew not Evil in any King or Degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was inwardly and outwardly &s;inle&s;s and undefiled. He
<PB N="93" REF="028060_0088_0FD68AA5163BE118"><HI>loved the Lord his God with all his Heart, and with all his Mind and Soul and Strength.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To Man thus upright and perfect, God give a perfect Law, to which he required full and perfect Obedience. He required full Obedience in every Point, and this to be performed without any Intermi&s;&s;ion, from the Moment Man became a living Soul, till the Time of his Trial &s;hould be ended. No Allowance was made for any fall|ing &s;hort. As indeed there was no need of any; Man being altogether equal to the Ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned, and thoroughly furni&s;hed for every good Word and Work.</P>
<P N="3">3. To the entire Law of Love which was written in his Heart (again&s;t which perhaps he could not &s;in directly) it &s;eemed good to the &s;ove|reign Wi&s;dom of God, to &s;uperadd one po&s;i|tive Law: <HI>Thou &s;halt not eat of the Fruit of the Tree that groweth in the mid&s;t of the Garden:</HI> Annexing that Penalty thereto, <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Such then was the State of Man in Para|di&s;e. By the free, unmerited Love of God, he was holy and happy; he knew, loved, enjoyed God, which is (in Sub&s;tance) Life everla&s;ting. And in this Life of Love, he was to continue for ever, if he continued to obey God in all Things: But if he di&s;obeyed in any, he was to forfeit all. <HI>In that Day,</HI> &s;aid God, <HI>thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Man did di&s;obey God. He <HI>ate of the Tree, of which God commanded him, &s;aying, Thou &s;halt not eat of it.</HI> And in that Day he was condemned, by the righteous Judgment of God. Then al&s;o the Sentence whereof he was
<PB N="94" REF="028060_0089_0FD68AAAF6EB76A8">warned before, began to take Place upon him. For the Moment he ta&s;ted that Fruit, he died: His Soul died, was &s;eparated from God; &s;epa|rate from whom the Soul has no more Life, than the Body has when &s;eparate from the Soul. His Body likewi&s;e became corruptible and mortal; &s;o that Death then took hold on this al&s;o. And be|ing already dead in Spirit, dead to God, dead in Sin, he ha&s;tened on to Death everla&s;ting; to the De&s;truction both of Body and Soul, in the Fire never to be quenched.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus <HI>by one Man, Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin. And &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men,</HI> as being contained in him who was the common Father and Repre&s;entative of us all. Thus <HI>through the Offence of one,</HI> all are dead, dead to God, dead in Sin, dwelling in a cor|ruptible, mortal Body, &s;hortly to be di&s;&s;olved, and under the Sentence of Death eternal. For as <HI>by one Man's Di&s;obedience, all were made &s;inners;</HI> &s;o by that Offence of one, <HI>Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation,</HI> Rom. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In this State we were, even all Mankind, when God <HI>&s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the End we might not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> In the Fulne&s;s of Time, he was made Man, another common Head of Mankind, a &s;econd general Parent and Repre&s;en|tative of the whole human Race. And as &s;uch it was that <HI>he bore our Griefs,</HI> the Lord <HI>laying upon him the Iniquities of us all.</HI> Then <HI>was he wound|ed for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&s;ed for our Iniqui|ties. He made his Soul an Offering for Sin:</HI> He poured out his Blood for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;gre&s;&s;ors: He <HI>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</HI> that
<PB N="95" REF="028060_0090_0FD68AABD980F9F8"><HI>by his Stripes we</HI> might be <HI>healed:</HI> And <HI>by that one Oblation of him&s;elf once offered, he hath redeemed me and all Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kind;</HI> having thereby <HI>made a full, per|fect and &s;ufficient Sacrifice and Satisfaction, for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. In Con&s;ideration of this, that the Son of God hath <HI>ta&s;ted Death for every Man,</HI> God hath now <HI>reconciled the World to him&s;elf, not in|puting to them their former Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> And thus, <HI>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even &s;o by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free Gift came upon all Men unto Ju&s;|tification.</HI> So that for the Sake of his we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-he-loved Son, of what he hath done and &s;uffered for <HI>us,</HI> God now vouch&s;afes on one only Condition (which him&s;elf al&s;o enables us to perform) both to remit the Puni&s;hment due to our Sins, to re|in&s;tate us in his Favour, and to re&s;tore our dead Souls to &s;piritual Life, as the Earne&s;t of Life eternal.</P>
<P N="9">9. This therefore is the general Ground, of the whole Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification.</HI> By the Sin of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> who was not only the Father, but likewi&s;e the Repre&s;entative of us all, we all <HI>fell &s;hort of the</HI> Favour <HI>of</HI> God: we all became <HI>Children of Wrath:</HI> Or, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI> Even &s;o, by the Sacrifice for Sin made by the &s;e|cond <HI>Adam,</HI> as the Repre&s;entative of us all, God is &s;o far reconciled to all the World, that he hath given them a New Covenant. The plain Condition whereof being once fulfilled, <HI>there is no more Condemnation for us,</HI> but we are <HI>ju&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="028060_0091_0FD68AD3C8263E20">
But what is it to be <HI>ju&s;tified?</HI> What is <HI>Ju&s;tification?</HI> This was the &s;econd Thing which I propo&s;ed to &s;hew.

This is <HI>Sanctification;</HI> which is indeed, in &s;ome Degree, the immeditate <HI>Fruit</HI> of Ju&s;tification: But neverthele&s;s is a di&s;tinct Gift of God, and of a totally different Nature.

So that altho' &s;ome rare In&s;tances may be found, wherein the Term <HI>Ju&s;tified,</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> is u&s;ed in &s;o wide a Sen&s;e as to include <HI>Sanctification</HI> al&s;o; yet in ge|neral U&s;e, they are &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, both by St. <HI>Paul</HI> and the other in&s;pir|ed Writers.</P>

<P N="5">5. The plain &s;criptural Notion of Ju&s;tification is Pardon, the Forgivene&s;s of Sins. It is that Act of God the Father, whereby for the &s;ake of the Propitiation made by the Blood of his Son, he <HI>&s;heweth forth his Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (or Mer|cy) <HI>by the Remi&s;&s;ion of the Sins that are pa&s;t.</HI> This is the ea&s;y, natural Account of it given by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> throughout this whole Epi&s;tle. So he explains it him&s;elf, more particularly in this, and in the following Chapter. Thus in the next,

His Sins, all his pa&s;t Sins, in Thought, Word and Deed, are covered, are blotted out: &s;hall not be remembered or mentioned again&s;t him, any more than if they had not been.

<P>Indeed the Apo&s;tle in one Place &s;eems to extend the Meaning of the Word much farther; where he &s;ays, <HI>Not the Hearers of the Low, but the Do|ers of the Law &s;hall be ju&s;tified.</HI> Here he appears to refer our Ju&s;tification, to the Sentence of the great Day.

III. 1. But this is the third Thing which was to be con&s;idered, namely, who are they that are ju&s;tified? And the Apo&s;tle tells us expre&s;ly, <HI>the Ungodly:</HI> He, that is, God, <HI>ju&s;tifieth the Un|godly:</HI> The Ungodly of every Kind and Degree, and none but the Ungodly. As <HI>they that are righ|teous, need no Repentance,</HI> &s;o they need no For|givene&s;s. It is only Sinners that have any Occa|&s;ion for Pardon: It is Sin alone which admits of being forgiven. Forgivene&s;s therefore has an im|mediate Reference to Sin, and (in this Re&s;pect) to nothing el&s;e. It is our <HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to which the pardoning God is <HI>merciful:</HI> It is our <HI>Iniquity</HI> which he <HI>remembereth no more.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;eems not to be at all con&s;idered by tho&s;e who &s;o vehemently contend, that a Man mu&s;t be &s;anctified, that is, holy, before he can be ju&s;tified: E&s;pecially by &s;uch of them as affirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that univer&s;al Holine&s;s or Obedience mu&s;t precede Ju&s;tification (unle&s;s they mean, that Ju&s;tification at the la&s;t Day, which is wholly out of the pre|&s;ent Que&s;tion) &s;o far from it, that the very Sup|po&s;ition, is not only flatly impo&s;&s;ible (for where there is no Love of God, there is no Holine&s;s; and there is no Love of God, but from a Sen&s;e of his loving us) but al&s;o gro&s;ly, intrin&s;ically ab|&s;urd, contradictory to it&s;elf. For it is not a <HI>Saint</HI> but a <HI>Sinner</HI> that is <HI>forgiven,</HI> and under the Notion of a Sinner.

Upon what Condition he doth this, will be con&s;idered quickly: But whatever it is, it cannot be Holine&s;s. To a&s;|&s;ert this, is to &s;ay, the Lamb of God takes

<P>Therefore no Works done before Ju&s;tification are good.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is &s;elf-evident. And the &s;econd, That no Works done before Ju&s;tification, are done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, will appear equally plain and
<PB N="102" REF="028060_0097_0FD68AB93B307F10">undeniable, if we only con&s;ider God hath willed and commanded, that <HI>all our Works</HI> &s;hould <HI>be done in Charity,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) in Love, in that Love to God, which produces Love to all Man|kind. But none of our Works can be done in this Love, while the Love of the Father (of God as our Father) is not in us.

<P N="4">IV. 1. But on what Terms then is he ju&s;tified, who is altogether <HI>ungodly,</HI> and till that Time, <HI>worketh not?</HI> On one alone, which is Faith.

That it is the Moral Law, and that alone which is here intended, ap|pears evidently from the Words that follow. <HI>Do we then make void the Law through Faith?</HI> God <HI>forbid! Yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI> What Law do we e&s;tabli&s;h by Faith? Not the Ritual Law:

<P N="2">2.

Ju&s;tifying Faith implies, not only a Divine Evidence or Convic|tion, that God <HI>was in Chri&s;t, reconciling the World unto him&s;elf,</HI> but a &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confi|dence, that Chri&s;t died for <HI>my</HI> Sins, that he loved <HI>me</HI> and gave him&s;elf for <HI>me.</HI> And at what Time &s;oever a Sinner thus believes, be it in early Child|hood, in the Strength of his Years, or when he is old and hoary-hair'd, God ju&s;tifieth that un|godly one: God for the &s;ake of his Son, pardon|eth and ab&s;olveth him who had in him till then no good Thing. Repentance indeed God had given him before: But that Repentance was nei|ther more nor le&s;s, than a deep Sen&s;e of the Want of all Good, and the Pre&s;ence of all Evil. And whatever Good he hath or doth from that Hour, when he fir&s;t believes in God through Chri&s;t, Faith does not <HI>find</HI> but <HI>bring.</HI> This is the Fruit of Faith. Fir&s;t the Tree is good, and then the Fruit is good al&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. I cannot de&s;cribe the Nature of this Faith better, than in the Words of our own Church. "The only In&s;trument of Salvation" (whereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ju&s;tification is one Branch) "is Faith: that is, a &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confidence, that God both hath and will forgive our Sins, that he hath accepted us again into his Favour, for the Merits of Chri&s;t's. Death and Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But here we mu&s;t take heed that we do not halt with God, through an in|con&s;tant,
<PB N="104" REF="028060_0099_0FD68ABCAD4AE4F8">wavering Faith. <HI>Peter</HI> coming to Chri&s;t upon the Water, becau&s;e he fainted in Faith, was in danger of drowning. So we, if we begin to waver or doubt, it is to be feared, that we &s;hould &s;ink as <HI>Peter</HI> did, not into the Water, but into the bottomle&s;s Pit of Hell-fire." Second Sermon on the Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Therefore have a &s;ure and con&s;tant Faith, not only that the Death of Chri&s;t is available for; all the World, but that he hath made a full and &s;ufficient Sacrifice for <HI>thee,</HI> a perfect clean&s;ing of <HI>thy</HI> Sins, &s;o that thou may&s;t &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, He loved <HI>thee</HI> and gave him&s;elf for <HI>thee.</HI> For this is to make Chri&s;t <HI>thine own,</HI> and to apply his Merits unto <HI>thy&s;elf.</HI>" Sermon on the Sacrament, fir&s;t Part.</P>
<P N="4">4. By affirming that this Faith is the Term or <HI>Condition of Ju&s;tification,</HI> I mean, fir&s;t, that there is no Ju&s;tification without it. <HI>He that be|lieveth not is condemned already;</HI> and &s;o long as he believeth not, that Condemnation cannot be re|moved, but <HI>the Wrath of</HI> God <HI>abideth on him.</HI> As <HI>there is no other Name given under Heaven th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that of Je&s;us of Nazareth,</HI> no other Merit <HI>whereby</HI> a condemned Sinner can ever <HI>be &s;aved</HI> from the Guilt of Sin; &s;o there is no other Way of obtaining a Share in his Merit, than <HI>by Faith in his Name.</HI> So that as long as we are without this Faith, we are <HI>Strangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e,</HI> we are <HI>Aliens from the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, and without</HI> God <HI>in the World.</HI> What|&s;oever Virtues (&s;o called) a Man may have (I &s;peak of tho&s;e unto whom the Go&s;pel is preached; for <HI>what have I to do to judge them that are without?</HI>) what&s;oever good Works (&s;o accounted) he may

<P N="5">5. Faith therefore is the <HI>nece&s;&s;ery</HI> Condition of Ju&s;tification. Yea, and the <HI>only nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Con|dition thereof. This is the &s;econd Point care|fully to be ob&s;erved; that the very Moment God giveth Faith (<HI>for it is the Gift of</HI> God) to the <HI>Un|godly, that worketh not,</HI> that <HI>Faith is counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He hath no Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all, antecedent to this, not &s;o much as negative Righteou&s;ne&s;s or Innocence. But <HI>Faith is imputed to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the very Moment that he believeth. Not that God (as was ob&s;erved before) thinketh him to be, what he is not.

<P N="6">6. Surely the Difficulty of a&s;&s;enting to the Propo&s;ition, That Faith is the <HI>only Condition</HI> of Ju&s;tification, mu&s;t ari&s;e from not under&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> We mean thereby thus much, That it is the only Thing without which none is ju&s;tified; the only Thing that is immediately, indi&s;pen&s;ably, ab&s;o|lutely requi&s;ite in order to Pardon.

<P N="1">1. THE Apo&s;tle doe~s not here oppo&s;e the Co|venant given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the Covenant given by Chri&s;t. If we ever imagined this, it was for want of ob&s;erving, that the latter, as well as the former Part of the&s;e Words, were &s;poken by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and that, concerning the Covenant which then was. (<HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 11, 12, 14.) But it is the Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> which God through Chri&s;t hath e&s;tabli&s;h|ed with Men in all Ages, (as well before and under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, as &s;ince God was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h) which St. <HI>Paul</HI> here oppo&s;es to the Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> made with <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="028060_0107_0FD62874E2656798">while in Paradi&s;e; but commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only Covenant which God had made with Man, particularly by tho&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> of whom the A|po&s;tle writes.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the&s;e it was that he &s;o affectionately &s;peaks, in the Beginning of this Chapter. <HI>My Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they may be &s;aved. For I bear them Record, that they have a Zeal for</HI> God, <HI>but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of</HI> God's <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (of the Ju&s;tification that flows from his mere Grace and Mercy, freely forgiving our Sins through the Son of his Love, through the Redemption which is in Je&s;us) <HI>and &s;eeking to e&s;ta|bli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> (their own Holine&s;s, antecedent to Faith, in <HI>him that ju&s;tifieth the &V;n|godly,</HI> as the Ground of their Pardon and Accep|tance) <HI>have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> God, and con&s;equently &s;eek Death in the Error of their Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. They were ignorant, that <HI>Chri&s;t is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that be|lieveth,</HI> that by the Oblation of him&s;elf once of|fered, he had put an End to the fir&s;t Law or Co|venant (which indeed was not given by God to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but to <HI>Adam</HI> in his State of Innocence) the &s;trict Tenor whereof, without any Abate|ment was; "Do this and live:" And at the &s;ame time purcha&s;ed for us that better Covenant, "Believe and live;" Believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved; now faved both from the Guilt and Power of Sin, and, of Con&s;equence, from the Wages of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="4">4. And how many are equally ignorant now, even among tho&s;e who are called by the Name
<PB N="115" REF="028060_0108_0FD68AD5D4671D30">of Chri&s;t? How many who have now a <HI>Zeal for God,</HI> yet have it not <HI>according to Knowledge:</HI> But are &s;till <HI>&s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as the Ground of their Pardon and Ac|ceptance; and therefore vehemently refu&s;e, to <HI>&s;ubmit them&s;elves unto the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> God? Surely my Heart's De&s;ire, and Prayer to God for you, Brethren, is, that ye may be &s;aved. And in order to remove this grand Stumbling-block out of your Way, I will endeavour to &s;hew, fir&s;t, What <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is, <HI>which is of the Law,</HI> and what <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith;</HI> Secondly, The Folly of tru&s;ting in <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law,</HI> and the Wi&s;dom of <HI>&s;ubmitting to that which is of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, fir&s;t, <HI>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, &s;aith, the Man which doth the&s;e Things, &s;hall live by them.</HI> Con&s;tantly and perfectly ob|&s;erve all the&s;e Things to do them, and then thou &s;halt live for ever. This Law or Covenant (u&s;u|ally called, The Covenant of <HI>Works</HI>) given by God to Man in Paradi&s;e, required an Obedience, perfect in all its Parts, entire and wanting no|thing, as the Condition of his eternal Continu|ance, in the Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s wherein he was created.</P>
<P N="2">2. It required, that Man &s;hould fulfil all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, inward and outward, negative and po&s;itive: That he &s;hould not only ab&s;tain from every idle Word, and avoid every evil Work, but &s;hould keep every Affection, every De&s;ire, every Thought in Obedience to the Will of God. That he &s;hould continue holy, as he which had created him was holy, both in Heart
<PB N="116" REF="028060_0109_0FD68ADE2E6CCBD0">and in all Manner of Conver&s;ation: That he &s;hould be pure in Heart, even as God is pure: perfect as his Father in Heaven was perfect: That he &s;hould love the Lord his God with all his Heart, with all his Soul, with all his Mind, and with all his Strength: That he &s;hould love every Soul which God had made, even as God had loved him: That by this univer&s;al Benevo|lence, he &s;hould <HI>dwell in God</HI> (who is Love) <HI>and</HI> God <HI>in him:</HI> That he &s;hould &s;erve the Lord his God with all his Strength, and in all Things &s;ing|ly aim at his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e were the Things which the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Law required, that he who did them might live thereby. But it farther required. That this entire Obedience to God, this inward and outward Holine&s;s, this Conformity both of Heart and Life to his Will, &s;hould be perfect in <HI>Degree.</HI> No Abatement, no Allowance could po&s;&s;ibly be made, for falling &s;hort in any Degree, as to any Jot or Tittle either of the outward or the inward Law. If every Commandment re|lating to outward Things was obeyed, yet that was not &s;ufficient, unle&s;s every one was obeyed with all the Strength, in the highe&s;t Mea&s;ure, and mo&s;t perfect Manner. Nor did it an&s;wer the Demand of this Covenant, to love God with every Power and Faculty, unle&s;s he were loved with the full Capacity of each, with the whole Po&s;&s;ibility of the Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. One Thing more was indi&s;pen&s;ably required by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law, namely, that this univer&s;al Obedience, this perfect Holine&s;s both of Heart and Life, &s;hould be perfectly unin|terrupted al&s;o, &s;hould continue without any In|termi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="117" REF="028060_0110_0FD68ADFAA016EE8">from the Moment wherein God cre|ated Man, and breathed into his No&s;trile the Breath of Life, until the Days of his Trial &s;hould be ended, and he &s;hould be confirmed in Life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s then which is of the Law, &s;peaketh on this wi&s;e. "Thou, O Man of God, &s;tand fa&s;t in Love, in the Image of God, wherein thou art made. If then wilt re|main in Life, keep the Commandments, which are now written in thy Heart. Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart. Love as thy&s;elf every Soul that he hath made. De&s;ire nothing but God. Aim at God in every Thought, in every Word and Work. Swerve not in one Motion of Body or Soul, from him thy Mark and the Prize of thy high Calling. And let all that is in thee prai&s;e his holy Name, every Power and Faculty of thy Soul, in every Kind, in every Degree, and at every Moment of thine Exi&s;tence. <HI>This do, and thou &s;halt live:</HI> Thy Light &s;hall &s;hine, thy Love &s;hall &s;lame more and more, till thou art received up into the Hou&s;e of God in the Heavens, to reign with him for ever and ever."</P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>But the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith &s;peaketh on this wi&s;e: Say not i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thine Heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven, that is, to bring down Chri&s;t from Above</Q> (as tho' it were &s;ome impo&s;&s;ible Ta&s;k, which God required thee previou&s;ly to per|form, in order to thine Acceptance:) <Q>Or, who &s;hall de&s;cend into the Deep, that is, to bring up Chri&s;t from the Dead;</Q> (as tho' that were &s;till re|maining to be done, for the &s;ake of which thou wert to be accepted.) <Q>But what &s;aith it? The
<PB N="118" REF="028060_0111_0FD68AE11B9F3E48">Word</Q> (according to the Tenor of which, thou maye&s;t now be accepted as an Heir of Life eternal) <Q>is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is, the Word of Faith, which we preach:</Q> The new Covenant which God hath now e&s;tabli&s;hed with &s;inful Man, through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'By the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith,' is meant, that Condition of Ju&s;tification (and in Con&s;equence of pre&s;ent and final Salvation, if we endure therein unto the End) which was given by God to <HI>fallen Man,</HI> through the Merits and Mediation of his only begotten Son. This was in Part revealed to <HI>Adam</HI> &s;oon after his Fall, being contained in the Original Promi&s;e, made to him and his Seed, concerning the Seed of the Woman, who &s;hould <HI>brui&s;e the</HI> Serpent's <HI>Head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 15.</NOTE>. It was a little more clearly revealed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> by the Angel of God from Heaven, &s;aying,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxii. 15, 18.</NOTE> <Q>By My&s;elf have i &s;worn, &s;aith the Lord, that in thy Seed &s;hall all the Nations of the Earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> It was yet more fully made known to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to <HI>Da|vid,</HI> and to the Prophets that followed: And through them, to many of the People of God, in their re&s;pective Generations. But &s;till the Bulk even of the&s;e were ignorant of it; and very few under&s;tood it clearly. Still <HI>Life and Immortality</HI> were not &s;o <HI>brought to Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Jews</HI> of old, as they are now unto us <HI>by the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Now this Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">unful Man, "Perform un&s;inning Obedience and live." If this were the Term, he would have no more Be|nefit by all which Chri&s;t hath done and &s;uffered
<PB N="119" REF="028060_0112_0FD68AE45A545370">for him, than if he was required, in order to Life, to <HI>a&s;cend into Heaven and bring down Chri&s;t from Above;</HI> or to <HI>de&s;cend into the Deep,</HI> into the invi|&s;ible World, and <HI>bring up Chri&s;t from the Dead.</HI> It doth not require any Impo&s;&s;ibily to be done (altho' to mere Man, what it requires would be impo&s;&s;ible; but not, to Man a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spirit of God:) this were only, to mock human Weak|ne&s;s. Indeed, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the Covenant of <HI>Grace</HI> doth not requre us, to <HI>do</HI> any thing at all, as ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in order to our Ju&s;tification: But only, to believe in him, who, for the Sake of his Son, and the Propitia|tion which he hath made, <Q>ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly that worketh not,</Q> and imputes his Faith to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Even &s;o <Q>Abraham believed in the Lord<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xv. 6.</NOTE> and he counted it to him for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. II.</NOTE> And he received the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith&mdash;that he might be the Father of all them that believe&mdash;that Righteou&s;ne&s;s might be imputed unto them al&s;o.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 23, 24, 25.</NOTE> Now it was not written for his &s;ake alone, that it (i. e. Faith) was imputed to him. But for us al&s;o, to whom it &s;hall be imputed</Q> (to whom Faith &s;hall be imputed for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;tand in the Stead of perfect Obedience, in order to our Acceptance with God) <Q>if we believe on him who rai&s;ed up Je&s;us our Lord from the Dead: Who was delivered' to Death 'for our Offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our Ju&s;tification:</Q> "For the A&s;&s;urance of the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and of a &s;e|cond Life to come to them that believe."</P>
<P N="9">9. What &s;aith then the Covenant of Forgivene&s;s, of unmerited Love, of pardoning Mercy? <HI>Believe
<PB N="120" REF="028060_0113_0FD68AE595DD1778">in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> In the Day thou believe&s;t, thou &s;halt &s;urely live. Thou &s;halt be re&s;tored to the Favour of God; and in his Favour is Life. Thou &s;halt be &s;aved from the Cur&s;e and from the Wrath of God. Thou &s;halt be quickened from the Death of Sin, into the Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And if thou en|dure to the End, believing in Je&s;us, thou &s;halt ne|ver ta&s;te the &s;econd Death, but having &s;uffered with thy Lord, &s;halt al&s;o live and reign with him for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="10">10. Now <HI>this word is nigh thee.</HI> This Condi|tion of Life, is plain, ea&s;y, always at hand. <HI>It is in thy Mouth and in thy Heart,</HI> through the Operation of the Spirit of God. The Moment <HI>thou believe&s;t in thine Heart</HI> in him, whom God <HI>hath rai&s;ed from the Dead,</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;e&s;t with thy Mouth the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> as <HI>thy</HI> Lord and <HI>thy</HI> God, <HI>thou &s;halt be &s;aved</HI> from Condemnation, from the Guilt and Puni&s;hment of thy <HI>former</HI> Sins, and &s;halt have Power to &s;erve God in true Holine&s;s, all the <HI>remaining</HI> Days of thy Life.</P>
<P N="11">11. What is the Difference then between the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> and the <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith?</HI> Between the Fir&s;t Co|venant, or the Covenant of Works, and the Se|cond, the Covenant of Grace? The e&s;&s;ential, unchangeable Difference is this: The one &s;up|po&s;es him to whom it is given, to be already holy and happy, created in the image and enjoying the Favour of God; and pre&s;cribes the Condition whereon he may continue therein, in Love and Joy, Life and Immortality. The other &s;uppo&s;es him to whom it is given, to be now unholy and unhappy; fallen &s;hort of the glorious Image of
<PB N="121" REF="028060_0114_0FD68AEC321E2788">God, having the Wrath of God abiding on him, and ha&s;tening through Sin, whereby his Soul is dead, to bodily Death, and Death everla&s;ting. And to Man in this State, it pre&s;cribes the Con|dition, whereon he may regain the Pearl he has lo&s;t: May recover the Favour, and the Image of God, may retrieve the Life of God in his Soul, and be re&s;tored to the Knowledge and the Love of God, which is the Beginning of Life eternal.</P>
<P N="12">12. Again, the Covenant of Works, in order to Man's <HI>Continuance</HI> in the Favour of God, in his Knowledge and Love, in Holine&s;s and Hap|pine&s;s, required of perfect Man, a <HI>perfect</HI> and un|interrupted <HI>Obedience,</HI> to every Point of the Law of God. Whereas the Covenant of Grace, in or|der to Man's <HI>Recovery,</HI> of the Favour and Life of God, requires only <HI>Faith;</HI> living Faith in him who through God ju&s;tifies him that <HI>obeyed not.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Yet again: The Covenant of Works re|quired of <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Children, to <HI>pay the Price them&s;elves,</HI> in Con&s;ideration of which, they were to receive all the future Ble&s;&s;ings of God. But in the Covenant of Grace, &s;eeing we have nothing to pay, God <HI>frankly forgives us all:</HI> Provided only, that we believe in him, who hath <HI>paid the Frice for us;</HI> who hath given him&s;elf a <HI>Propitiation for our Sins, for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Thus the fir&s;t Covenant required what is now <HI>afar off</HI> from all the Children of Men; namely, unlinning Obedience, which is far from tho&s;e who are <HI>conceived and born in Sin.</HI> Where|as the &s;econd requires what is nigh at hand; as tho' it &s;hould &s;ay, Thou art Sin! God is Love. Thou by Sin art fallen &s;hort of the Glory of
<PB N="122" REF="028060_0115_0FD68AED9E1A4C80">God; yet there is Mercy with him. Bring then all thy Sins to the Pardoning God, and they &s;hall vani&s;h away as a Cloud. If thou wert not ungodly, there would be no room for him to ju&s;|tify thee as ungodly. But now draw near, in full A&s;&s;urance of Faith. He &s;peaketh, and it is done. Fear not, only believe; for even the ju&s;t God <HI>ju&s;tifieth all that believe in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. The&s;e Things con&s;idered, it will be ea&s;y to &s;hew, as I propo&s;ed to do in the &s;econd Place, the Folly of tru&s;ting in the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> and the Wi&s;dom of <HI>&s;ubmitting to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The Folly of tho&s;e who &s;till tru&s;t, in the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> the Terms of which are, Do this and live, may abundantly appear from hence. They &s;et out wrong. Their very fir&s;t Step is a fundamental Mi&s;take. For before they can ever think of claiming any Ble&s;|&s;ing on the Terms of this Covenant, they mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves to be in his State, with whom this Covenant was made. But how vain a Sup|po&s;ition is this? Since it was made with <HI>Adam</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> State of Innocence. How weak therefore mu&s;t that whole Building be, which &s;tands on &s;uch a Foundation? And how fooli&s;h are they who thus build on the Sand? Who &s;eem never to have con&s;idered, that the Covenant of Works was not given to Man, when he was dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and Sins, but when he was alive to God, when he knew no Sin, but was holy as God is holy: Who forget, that it was never de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Recovery</HI> of the Favour and Life of God once lo&s;t, but only for the <HI>Continuance</HI> and In|crea&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="028060_0116_0FD68AF0DF393D88">thereof, till it &s;hould be compleat in Life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither do they con&s;ider, who are thus <HI>&s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> what manner of Obedience or Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s that is, which the Law indi&s;pen&s;ably requires. It mu&s;t be perfect and entire, in every Point, or it an&s;wers not the Demand of the Law. But which of you is able to perform &s;uch Obe|dience? Or, con&s;equently, to live thereby? Who among you fulfils every Jot and Tittle even of the outward Commandments of God? Doing nothing, great or &s;mall, which God forbids? Leaving nothing undone which he enjoins? Speaking no <HI>idle Word?</HI> Having your Conver|&s;ation always <HI>meet to mini&s;ter Grace to the Hear|ers?</HI> And <HI>whether you eat or drink, or what|ever you do,</HI> doing <HI>all to the Glory of</HI> God? And how much le&s;s are you able to fulfil all the inward Commandments of God? Tho&s;e which require, that every Temper and motion of your Soul &s;hould be Holine&s;s unto the Lord? Are you able, To <HI>love</HI> God <HI>with all your Heart?</HI> To love all Mankind as your own Soul? To <HI>pray without cea&s;ing? In every Thing to give Thanks?</HI> To have God always before you? And to keep every Affection, De&s;ire and Thought, in Obe|dience to his Law?</P>
<P N="3">3. You &s;hould farther con&s;ider, That the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Law requires, not only the obeying every Command of God, negative and po&s;itive, internal and external, but likewi&s;e in the perfect Degree. In every in&s;tance whatever, the Voice of the Law is, Thou &s;halt &s;erve the Lord thy God with all thy Strength. It allows no Abate|ment
<PB N="124" REF="028060_0117_0FD68AF0E3A434E0">of any Kind. It excu&s;es no Defect. It condemns every coming &s;hort of the full Mea&s;ure of Obedience, and immediately pronounces a Cur&s;e on the Offender. It regards only the in|variable Rules of Ju&s;tice, and &s;aith, "I know not to &s;hew Mercy."</P>
<P N="4">4. Who then can appear before &s;uch a Judge, which is <HI>extreme to mark what is done ami&s;s?</HI> How weak are they who de&s;ire to be tried at the Bar, where <HI>no Fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified?</HI> None of the Offspring of <HI>Adam.</HI> For &s;uppo&s;e we did now keep every Commandment with all our Strength: Yet one &s;ingle Breach which ever was, utterly de|&s;troys our whole Claim to Life. If we have ever offended in any one Point, this Righteou&s;|ne&s;s is at an end. For the Law condemns all who do not perform uninterrupted as well as per|fect Obedience. So that according to the Sen|tence of this, for him who hath once finned, in any Degree, <HI>there remaineth only a fearful Look|ing for of fiery Indignation, which &s;hall devour the Adver&s;aries</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it not then the very Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Folly, for fallen Man to &s;eek Life by this Righteou&s;ne&s;s? For Man, who was <HI>&s;hapen in Wickedne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>in Sin did his Mother conceive him:</HI> Man, who is by Nature all <HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h,</HI> altogether <HI>corrupt and abominable:</HI> In whom, till he find Grace, <HI>dwelleth no good Thing;</HI> nay, who can|not of him&s;elf think one good Thought? Who is indeed all Sin, a mere Lump of Ungodline&s;s, and who commits Sin in every Breath he draws; who&s;e actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, in Word and Deed, are more in Number than the Hairs of his Head! What Stupidity, what Sen&s;ele&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t it be
<PB N="125" REF="028060_0118_0FD68AF45DB583B8">for &s;uch an unclean, guilty, helple&s;s Worm as this, to dream of &s;eeking Acceptance by <HI>his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> of living by <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which <HI>is of the Law?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Now what&s;oever Con&s;iderations prove the Folly of tru&s;ting in the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> prove equally the Wi&s;dom of &s;ubmit|ting to <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of</HI> God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Faith.</HI> This were ea&s;y to be &s;hewn with regard to each of the preceding Con&s;iderations. But to wave this, the Wi&s;dom of the fir&s;t &s;tep hereto, the di&s;claiming our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, plainly appears from hence, That it is acting according to Truth, to the real Nature of Things. For what is it more, than to acknowledge with our Heart as well as Lips, the true State wherein we are? To acknowledge, that we bring with us into the World, a corrupt, &s;inful Nature; more corrupt indeed than we can ea&s;ily conceive, or find Words to expre&s;s? That hereby we are prone to all that is evil, and aver&s;e from all that is good; that we are full of Pride, Self-will, un|ruly Pa&s;&s;ions, fooli&s;h De&s;ires, vile and inordi|nate Affections; Lovers of the World, Lovers of Plea&s;ure more than Lovers of God? That our Lives have been no better than our Hearts, but many ways ungodly and unholy; in&s;omuch that our actual Sins, both in Word and Deed, have been as the Stars of Heaven for Multi|tude: That on all the&s;e Accounts, we are di&s;|plea&s;ing to him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and de&s;erve nothing from him, but Indignation and Wrath and Death, the due Wages of Sin? That we cannot by any of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, (for indeed, we have none at all)
<PB N="126" REF="028060_0119_0FD68AF573AAF590">nor by any of our Works (for they are as the Tree from which they grow) appea&s;e the Wrath of God, or avert the Puni&s;hment we have ju&s;tly de&s;erved; Yea, that, if left to our&s;elves, we &s;hall only was wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;ink deeper and deeper into Sin, offend God more and more both with our evil Works, and with the evil Tempers of our carnal Mind, till we fill up the Mea&s;ure of our Iniquities, and bring upon our|&s;elves &s;wi&s;t De&s;truction? And is not this the very State wherein by Nature we are? To ac|knowledge this then, both with our Heart and Lips, that is, to di&s;claim our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law,</HI> is to act according to the Real Nature of Things, and con&s;equently is an in&s;tance of true Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Wi&s;dom of &s;ubmitting to <HI>the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> appears farther from this Con|&s;ideration. That it is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God: I mean here, It is that Method of Reconcilia|tion with God, which hath been cho&s;e and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by God him&s;elf, not only as he is the God of Wi&s;dom, but as he is the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, and of every Creature which he hath made. Now as it is not meet for Man to &s;ay unto God. What do&s;t thou? As none who is not utterly void of Under&s;tanding, will contend with one that is mightier than he, with him who&s;e Kingdom ruleth over all; &s;o it is true Wi&s;dom, it is a Mark of &s;ound Under&s;tand|ing, to acquie&s;ce in whatever he hath cho&s;en, to &s;ay in this, as in all Things, "It is the Lord. Let him do what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eemeth him Good."</P>
<P N="8">8. It may be farther con&s;idered. That it was of mere Grace, of free Love, of unde&s;erved
<PB N="127" REF="028060_0120_0FD68AF6D6C767D8">Mercy, that God hath vouch&s;afed to &s;inful Man, any way of Reconciliation with him&s;elf, that we were not out away from his Hand, and utterly blotted out of his Remembrance. Therefore whatever Method he is plea&s;ed to appoint, of his tender Mercy, of his unmerited Goodne&s;s, whereby his Enemies, who have &s;o deeply re|volted from him, &s;o long and ob&s;tinately rebelled again&s;t him, may &s;till find Favour in his Sight, it is doubtle&s;s our Wi&s;dom to accept with all Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. To mention but one Con&s;ideration more. It is wi&s;dom to aim at the be&s;t End by the be&s;t Means. Now the be&s;t End which any Creature can pur&s;ue, is Happine&s;s in God. And the be&s;t End a fallen Creature can pur&s;ue is, The Re|covery of the Favour and Image of God. But the be&s;t, indeed the only Means under Heaven given to Man, whereby he may regain the Fa|vour of God, which is better than Life it&s;elf, or the Image of God, which is the true Life of the Soul, is the &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith,</HI> the believing in the only be|gotten Son of God.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Who&s;oever therefore thou art who de|&s;ire&s;t to be forgiven and reconciled to the Favour of God; Do not &s;ay in thy Heart, "I mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t do this;</HI> I mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> conquer every Sin; break off every evil Word and Work, and do all Good to all Men: Or, I mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> go to Church, receive the Lord's Supper, hear more Sermons, and &s;ay more Prayers." Alas, my Brother, thou art clean gone out of the Way. Thou art &s;till <HI>ignorant of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="028060_0121_0FD68AF86FE3DF58">God, and art <HI>&s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h thy own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as the Ground of thy Reconciliation. Knowe&s;t thou not, that thou can&s;t do nothing but &s;in, till thou art reconciled to God? Where|fore then do&s;t thou &s;ay, I <HI>mu&s;t do this</HI> and this <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and then I &s;hall believe. Nay, but <HI>Fir&s;t Believe.</HI> Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Propitiation for thy Sins. Let this good Foun|dation <HI>fir&s;t</HI> be laid, and then thou &s;halt do all Things well.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither &s;ay in thy Heart, "I can't be ac|cepted yet, becau&s;e I am not <HI>good enough.</HI>" Who is <HI>good enough?</HI> Who ever was? To merit Ac|ceptance at God's Hands! Was ever any Child of <HI>Adam good enough</HI> for this? Or will any, till the Con&s;ummation of all Things? And as for thee, thou art not good at all: There dwelleth in thee no good Thing. And thou never wilt be, till thou believe in Je&s;us. Rather thou wilt find thy&s;elf wor&s;e and wor&s;e. But is there any need of being wor&s;e, in order to be accepted? Art thou not <HI>bad enough</HI> already? Indeed thou art, and that God knoweth. And thou thy&s;elf can&s;t not deny it. Then delay not. All Things are now ready. <HI>Ari&s;e and wa&s;h away thy Sins.</HI> The Fountain is open. Now is the Time, to wa&s;h thee white in the Blood of the Lamb. Now he &s;hall <HI>purge</HI> thee as <HI>with Hy&s;&s;op, and</HI> thou <HI>&s;halt be clean; he</HI> &s;hall <HI>wa&s;h</HI> thee, and thou <HI>&s;halt be whiter than Snow.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Do not &s;ay, "But I am not <HI>contrite enough:</HI> I am not <HI>&s;en&s;ible enough</HI> of my Sins." I know it. I would to God, thou wert more <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of them, more <HI>contrite</HI> a thou&s;and fold than thou art. But do not &s;tay for this. It may be God will make
<PB N="129" REF="028060_0122_0FD68AFDD8BBFC48">thee &s;o, not before thou believe&s;t, but by be|lieving. It may be, thou wilt nor weep much, till thou love&s;t much, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t had much forgiven. In the mean time, look unto Je&s;us. Behold how he loveth thee! What could he have done more for thee which he hath not done?
<Q><L>"O Lamb of God, was ever Pain,</L>
<L>Was ever Love like Thine!"</L></Q>
Look &s;teadily upon him, till he looks on thee, and breaks thy hard Heart. Then &s;hall thy <HI>Head</HI> be <HI>Waters, and</HI> thy <HI>Eyes Fountains of Tears.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nor yet do thou &s;ay, "I mu&s;t <HI>do</HI> &s;ome|thing more, <HI>before</HI> I come to Chri&s;t." I grant, &s;uppo&s;ing thy Lord &s;hould delay his coming, it were meet and right to wait for his appearing, in doing &s;o far as thou ha&s;t Power, what&s;oever he hath commanded thee. But there is no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for making &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition. How know|e&s;t thou that he will delay? Perhaps he will ap|pear, as the Day-&s;pring from on High, before the Morning-light. O do not &s;et him a Time. Ex|pect him every Hour. Now, he is nigh! Even at the Door!</P>
<P N="5">5. And to what End would&s;t thou wait for <HI>more Sincerity, before</HI> thy Sins are blotted out? To make thee more worthy of the Grace of God? Alas, thou art &s;till <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing thy own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> He will have Mercy, not becau&s;e thou art worthy of it, but becau&s;e his Compa&s;&s;ions fail not: Not becau&s;e thou art righteous; but becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath atoned for thy Sins.</P>
<P>Again, if there be any thing good in <HI>Sincerity,</HI> why do&s;t thou expect it, <HI>before</HI> thou ha&s;t Faith? See|ing
<PB N="130" REF="028060_0123_0FD68AFF20C68890">Faith it&s;elf is the only Root of whatever is really good and holy.</P>
<P>Above all, How long wilt thou forget, That what&s;oever thou do&s;t, or what&s;oever thou ha&s;t, before thy Sins are forgiven thee, it avails nothing with God, toward the procuring of thy For|givene&s;s? Yea, and that it mu&s;t all be ca&s;t be|hind thy Back, trampled under Foot, made no Account of, or thou wilt never find Favour in God's Sight; becau&s;e until then thou can&s;t not a&s;k it, as a mere Sinner, guilty, lo&s;t, undone, having nothing to plead, nothing to offer to God, but only the Merits of his well-beloved Son, <HI>who loved</HI> thee, <HI>and gave him&s;elf for</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="6">6. To conlude. Who&s;oever thou art, O Man, who ha&s;t the Sentence of Death in thy|&s;elf, who feele&s;t thy&s;elf a condemned Sinner, and ha&s;t the Wrath of God abiding on thee: Unto thee &s;aith the Lord, Not, Do this: per|fectly obey all my Commands and live: But, <HI>Be|lieve in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved. The Word of Faith is nigh unto thee;</HI> Now, at this in&s;tant, in the pre&s;ent Moment, and in thy pre&s;ent State, Sinner as thou art, ju&s;t as thou art, Believe the Go&s;pel: And <HI>I will be merciful unto</HI> thy <HI>Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and</HI> thy <HI>Iniqui|ties will I remember no more.</HI></P>

<P>The Kingdom of <HI>God</HI> is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel.</P></Q>

<P>THESE Words naturally lead us to con&s;i|der, Fir&s;t, The Nature of True Religion, here termed by our Lord, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God, which, &s;aith he, <HI>is at hand:</HI> And Secondly, The Way thereto, which he points out in tho&s;e Words, <HI>Repent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. We are Fir&s;t, to con&s;ider, The Na|ture of True Religion, here term'd by our Lord, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God. The &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ion the great Apo&s;tle u&s;es in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> where he likewi&s;e explains his Lord's Words, &s;aying, <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God <HI>is not Meat and Drink; but Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Chap. xiv. 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> God, or True Religion, <HI>is not Meat and Drink.</HI> It is well known, that not only the unconverted Jews, but great Num|bers of tho&s;e who had received the Faith of Chri&s;t, were notwith&s;tanding <HI>zealous of the Law,</HI> (<HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 20.) even the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> What&s;oever therefore they found written therein, either concerning Meat and Drink-Offerings,
<PB N="134" REF="028060_0126_0FD68B03AC84BA80">or the Di&s;tinction between clean and unclean Meats, they not only ob&s;erved them|&s;elves, but vehemently pre&s;s'd the &s;ame, even on tho&s;e <HI>among the Gentiles</HI> (or Heathens) <HI>who were turned to</HI> God. Yea, to &s;uch a Degree, that &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of them taught, where&s;oever they came a|mong them, <HI>Except ye be circumci&s;ed, and keep the Law</HI> (the whole Ritual Law) <HI>ye cannot be &s;aved.</HI> Acts xv. 1, 24.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, the Apo&s;tle de|clares, both here and in many other Places, That True Religion, does not con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> or in any Ritual Ob&s;ervances: Nor in|deed in any outward Thing whatever, in any Thing exterior to the Heart; the whole Sub|&s;tance thereof lying in <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Not in any <HI>outward Things;</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Forms</HI> or <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> even of the mo&s;t excellent Kind. Suppo&s;ing the&s;e to be ever &s;o decent and &s;ignifi|cant, ever &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of inward Things: Sup|po&s;ing them ever &s;o helpful, not only to the Vul|gar, who&s;e Thought reaches little farther than their Sight; but even to Men of Under&s;tanding, Men of &s;tronger Capacities, as doubtle&s;s they may &s;ometimes be: Yea, &s;uppo&s;ing them, as in the Ca&s;e of the Jews, to be appointed by God him&s;elf; yet even during the Period of Time wherein that Appointment remains in Force, True Religion does not principally con&s;i&s;t there|in; nay, &s;trictly &s;peaking, not at all. How much more mu&s;t this hold concerning &s;uch Rights and Forms, as are only of Human Appointment? The Religion of Chri&s;t ri&s;es infinitely higher, and lies immen&s;ely deeper than all the&s;e. The&s;e
<PB N="135" REF="028060_0127_0FD68B081B7B9560">are good in their Place; ju&s;t &s;o far as they are in fact &s;ub&s;ervient to true Religion. And it were Super&s;tition to object again&s;t them, while they are applied only as occa&s;ional Helps to Human Weakne&s;s. But let no Man carry them farther. Let no Man dream, that they have any intrin&s;ic Worth; or that Religion cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. This were to make them an Abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Nature of Religion is &s;o far from con|&s;i&s;ting in the&s;e, in <HI>Forms</HI> of Wor&s;hip, or <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> that it does not properly con&s;i&s;t in any <HI>outward Actions,</HI> of what Kind &s;oever. It is true, a Man cannot have any Religion, who is guilty of vicious, immoral Actions; or who does to others, what he would not they &s;hould do to him, if he were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tance. And it is al&s;o true, that he can have no real Religion, who <HI>knows to do good, and doth it not.</HI> Yet may a Man both ab&s;tain from outward Evil, and do Good, and &s;till have no Religion. Yea, two Per&s;ons may do the &s;ame outward Work, &s;uppo&s;e, Feeding the Hungry, or Cloathing the Naked: And, in the Mean Time, one of the&s;e may be truly Religious, and the other have no Religion at all: For the one may act from the Love of God, and the other from the Love of Prai&s;e. So manife&s;t it is; that altho' true Religion natu|rally leads to every good Word and Work, yet the Real Nature thereof lies deeper &s;till, even in <HI>the Hidden Man of the Heart.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;ay of <HI>the Heart.</HI> For neither does Re|ligion con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> or <HI>Right Opinions;</HI> which altho' they are not properly outward things, and not in the Heart, but the Under&s;tanding.
<PB N="136" REF="028060_0128_0FD68B0B6936DB88">A Man may be orthodox in every Point; he may not only e&s;pou&s;e Right Opinions, but zealou&s;ly defend them again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers: He may think ju&s;tly concerning the Incarnation of our Lord, concerning the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, and every other Doctrine, contained in the Oracles of God: He may a&s;&s;ent to all the three Creeds; that called The Apo&s;tles, the <HI>Nicene,</HI> and the <HI>Atha|na&s;ian:</HI> And yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible, he may have no Religion at all, no more than a <HI>Jew, Turk,</HI> or <HI>Pagan.</HI> He may be almo&s;t as orthodox as &mdash; the Devil; (tho' indeed, not altogether. For every Man errs in &s;omething; whereas we can't well conceive him to hold any erroneous Opinion) and may all the while be as great a Stranger as he to the Religion of the Heart.</P>
<P N="7">7. This alone is Religion, truly &s;o called: This alone is in the Sight of God of great Price.

<P N="8">8.

<P N="9">9. Now is not this Love <HI>The fulfilling of the Law?</HI> The Sum of all Chri&s;tian Righteou&s;ne&s;s?
<PB N="138" REF="028060_0130_0FD68B0FEEDC0478">Of all inward Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for it nece&s;&s;arily im|plies <HI>Bowels of Mercies, Humblene&s;s of Mind</HI> (&s;ee|ing <HI>Love is not puffed up) Gentlene&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering,</HI> (for Love <HI>is not provoked</HI> but <HI>be|lieveth, hopeth, endureth all Things</HI>) and of all out|ward Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for <HI>Love worketh no Evil to his Neighbour,</HI> either by Word or Deed.

<P N="10">10. But true Religion, or a Heart right toward God and Man, implies Happine&s;s as well as Ho|line&s;s.

<P N="2">II. 1. This is the Way. Walk ye in it. And fir&s;t, Repent, that is, Know your&s;elves. This is the fir&s;t Repentance, previous to Faith; even Conviction, or Self-Knowledge. Awake then thou that &s;leepe&s;t. Know thy&s;elf to be a Sinner, and what Manner of Sinner thou art. Know that Corruption of thy inmo&s;t Nature, whereby thou art very far gone from Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, whereby <HI>the Fle&s;h lu&s;teth</HI> always <HI>contrary to the Spirit,</HI> through that <HI>carnal Mind which is Enmity again&s;t</HI> God, which <HI>is not &s;ubject to the Law of</HI> God, <HI>neither indeed can be.</HI> Know that thou art corrupted in every Power, in every Faculty of thy Soul; that thou art totally corrupted in every one of the&s;e, all the Foundations being out of Cour&s;e. The Eyes of thine Under&s;tanding are darkened, &s;o that they cannot di&s;cern God or the Things of God. The Clouds of Ignorance and Error re&s;t upon thee, and cover thee with the Shadow of Death. Thou knowe&s;t nothing yet, as thou oughte&s;t to know, neither God, nor the World, nor thy&s;elf. Thy Will is no longer the Will of God, but is utterly perver&s;e and di&s;torted, aver&s;e from all Good, from all which God loves, and prone to all Evil, to every Abomination which God hateth. Thy Affections are alienated from God, and &s;cattered abroad over all the Earth. All thy Pa&s;&s;ions, both thy De&s;ires and Aver&s;ions, thy Joys and Sorrows, thy Hopes and Fears, are out of Frame, are either undue in their Degree, or placed on undue Objects. So that there is no Soundne&s;s in thy Soul; but <HI>from the Crown of the
<PB N="142" REF="028060_0134_0FD68B148DE46580">Head to the Sole of the Foot</HI> (to u&s;e the &s;trong Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the Prophet) there are only <HI>Wounds and Brui&s;es and putrifying Sores.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Such is the inbred Corruption of thy Heart, of thy very inmo&s;t Nature. And what Manner of Branches can&s;t thou expect to grow, from &s;uch an evil Root? Hence &s;prings Unbelief, ever depart|ing from the living God: Saying, "Who is the Lord that I &s;hould &s;erve him? Tu&s;h! Thou, God, care&s;t not for it." Hence Independence, affecting to be like the Mo&s;t High; hence Pride, in all its Forms, teaching thee to &s;ay, "I am rich, and increa&s;ed in Goods, and have need of nothing." From this evil Fountain flow forth the bitter &s;treams of Vanity, Thir&s;t of Prai&s;e; Ambition, Covetou&s;ne&s;s; the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. From this ari&s;e Anger, Hatred, Malice, Revenge, Envy, Jealou&s;y, evil Surmi&s;ings: From this all the fool|i&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts, that now <HI>pierce thee through with many Sorrows,</HI> and if not timely prevented, will at length <HI>drown thy Soul in everla&s;ting Perdi|tion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And what Fruits can grow on &s;uch Branches as the&s;e? Only &s;uch as are bitter and evil conti|nually. Of Pride cometh Contention, vain boa&s;t|ing, &s;eeking and receiving Prai&s;e of Men, and &s;o robbing God of that Glory which he cannot give unto another. Of the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h come Gluttony or Drunkenne&s;s, Luxury or Sen|&s;uality: Fornication, Uncleanne&s;s, variou&s;ly de|filing that Body, which was de&s;igned for a Temple of the Holy Gho&s;t: Of Unbelief, every evil Word and Work. But the Time would fail, &s;hould'&s;t thou reckon up all; all the idle Words
<PB N="143" REF="028060_0135_0FD68B182F857B48">thou ha&s;t &s;poken, provoking the Mo&s;t High, grieving the holy One of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> All the evil Works thou ha&s;t done, either wholly evil in them|&s;elves, or at lea&s;t, not done to the Glory of God.

<P N="4">4. And knowe&s;t thou not that <HI>the Wages of Sin is Death?</HI> Death not only temporal, but eternal. <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die:</HI> For the Mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it. It &s;hall die the &s;econd Death.

Thou art guilty of everla&s;t|ing Death. It is the ju&s;t Reward of thy Inward and Outward Wickedne&s;s. It is ju&s;t, that the Sentence &s;hould now take place. Do&s;t thou &s;ee, do&s;t thou feel this? Art thou thoroughly convinced, that thou de&s;erve&s;t God's Wrath and everla&s;ting Damnation? Would God do thee no wrong, if he now commanded the Earth to open and &s;wal|low thee up? If thou wert now to go down quick into the Pit, into the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched? If God hath given thee truly to repent, thou ha&s;t a deep Sen&s;e that the&s;e Things are &s;o; and that it is of his mere Mercy thou art not con&s;umed, &s;wept away from the Face of the Earth.</P>

5. And what wilt thou do to appea&s;e the Wrath of God, to atone for all thy Sins, and to e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment thou ha&s;t &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erved? Alas, thou can&s;t do nothing: Nothing that will in any wi&s;e make amends to God, for one evil Work, or Word, or Thought. If thou could&s;t now do all Things well, if from this very Hour, till thy Soul &s;hould return to God, thou coulde&s;t perform perfect uninterrupted Obedience, even this would not atone for what is pa&s;t. The not increa&s;ing thy Debt would not di&s;charge it. It would &s;till remain as great as ever. Yea, the pre&s;ent and fu|ture Obedience of all the Men upon Earth, and all the Angels in Heaven, would never make Sa|tisfaction to the Ju&s;tice of God for one &s;ingle Sin. How vain then was the Thought, of aton|ing for thy own Sins by any Thing thou could'&s;t do? It co&s;teth far more to redeem one Soul, than all Mankind is able to pay. So that were there no other Help for a guilty Sinner, without Doubt he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed everla&s;tingly.</P>
<P N="6">6. But &s;uppo&s;e perfect Obedience for the time to come, could atone for the Sins that are pa&s;t, this would profit thee nothing; for thou art not able to perform it; no, not in any one Point. Begin now. Make the Trial. Shake off that outward Sin that &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;etteth thee. Thou can&s;t not. How then wilt thou change thy Life from all Evil to all Good? Indeed, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to be done, unle&s;s fir&s;t thy Heart be changed. For &s;o long as the Tree remains evil, it cannot bring forth good Fruit. But art thou able to change thy own Heart, from all Sin to all Holi|ne&s;s? To quicken a Soul that is dead in Sin? Dead to God and alive only to the World? No more
<PB N="145" REF="028060_0137_0FD68B1DDEB9EFB0">than thou art able to quicken a dead Body, to rai&s;e to Life him that lieth in the Grave. Yea, thou art not able to quicken thy Soul in any De|gree, no more than to give any Degree of Life to the dead Body. Thou can&s;t do nothing more or le&s;s, in this Matter; thou art utterly without Strength. To be deeply &s;en&s;ible of this, how helple&s;s thou art, as well as how guilty and how &s;inful, this is that <HI>Repentance not to be repented of,</HI> which is the Fore-runner of the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. If to this lively Conviction of thy inward and outward Sins, of thy utter Guiltine&s;s and Helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, there be added &s;uitable Affections, Sorrow of Heart, for having de&s;pi&s;ed thy own Mercies, Remor&s;e and Self-condemnation, having the Mouth &s;top'd, a&s;hamed to lift up thine Eyes to Heaven; Fear of the Wrath of God abiding on thee, of his Cur&s;e hanging over thy Head, and of the fiery Indignation ready to devour tho&s;e who forget God, and obey not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Earne&s;t De&s;ire to e&s;cape from that Indignation, to cea&s;e from evil and learn to do well: Then I &s;ay unto thee in the Name of the Lord, <HI>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> One Step more and thou &s;halt enter in.

<P N="8">8. <HI>The Go&s;pel</HI> (that is, good Tidings, good News for guilty, helple&s;s Sinners) in the large&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, means, the whole Revela|tion made to Men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And &s;ome|times the whole Account of what our Lord did and &s;uffered, while he tabernacled among Men. The Sub&s;tance of all is, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners.</HI> Or, <HI>GOD &s;o loved the

<P N="9">9. Believe this and the Kingdom of God is thine. By Faith thou attaine&s;t the Promi&s;e. "He pardoneth and ab&s;olveth all that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his holy Go&s;pel." As &s;oon as ever God hath &s;poken to thy Heart, "Be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee," his Kingdom com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; thou ha&s;t Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, and Joy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. Only beware thou do not deceive thy own Soul, with regard to the Nature of this Faith. It is not (as &s;ome have fondly conceived) a bare A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Bible, of the Articles of our Creed, or of all that is contained in the Old and New Te&s;tament. The Devils believe this, as well as I or thou? and yet they are Devils &s;till. But it is, over and above this, a &s;ure Tru&s;t in the Mercy of God through Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is a Confidence in a pardoning God. It is a Divine Evidence or Conviction, that <HI>GOD was in Chri&s;t reconciling the World to him&s;elf, not imputing to them their former Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es:</HI> And in particular, that the Son of God hath loved <HI>me</HI> and given him|&s;elf for me: and that I, even I, am now recon|ciled to God by the Blood of the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="11">11. Do&s;t thou thus believe? Then the Peace of God is in thy Heart, and Sorrow and Sighing flee away. Thou art no longer in doubt for the Love of God: It is clear as the Noon-day Sun. Thou crye&s;t out, <HI>My Song &s;hall be always of the

<P>And, fir&s;t, To Believers in Chri&s;t, walking thus, <HI>there is no Condemnation</HI> on Account of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pa&s;t Sins.

<P N="5">5. They are not condemned, Secondly, for any Pre&s;ent Sins, for now tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Com|mandments of God.

<P N="6">6. They are not condemned Thirdly, for In|ward Sin, even tho' it does now remain. That the Corruption of Nature does &s;till remain, even in tho&s;e who are the Children of God by Faith, that they have in them the Seeds of Pride and Vanity, of Anger, Lu&s;t and evil De&s;ire, yea, Sin of every Kind, is too plain to be denied, being Matter of daily Experience.

<P N="7">7. And yet, for all this, they are not con|demned. Altho' they &s;eel the Fle&s;h, the evil Nature in them, altho' they are more &s;en&s;ible Day by Day, that their <HI>Heart is deceitful and de&s;pe|rately wicked:</HI> Yet &s;o long as they do not yield thereto, &s;o long as they give no Place to the De|vil, &s;o long as they maintain a continual War, with all Sin, with Pride, Anger, De&s;ire, &s;o that the Fle&s;h hath not Dominion over them, but they &s;till <HI>walk after the Spirit:</HI> There is <HI>no Condemna|tion to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> God is well-plea&s;ed with their &s;incere, tho' imperfect Obedience: And they <HI>have Confidence toward</HI> God, knowing <HI>they are his, by the Spirit which he hath given them.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 24.</P>
<P N="8">8. Nay, Fourthly, altho' they are continually convinced of Sin cleaving to all they do; altho' they are con&s;cious of not fulfilling the Perfect Law, either in their Thoughts, or Words, or Works; altho' they know they do not love the Lord their God, with all their Heart, and Mind, and Soul and Strength; altho' they &s;eel more or le&s;s of Pride or Self will, &s;tealing in and mixing with their be&s;t Duties; altho' even in their more immediate Intercour&s;e with God, when they a&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves with the great Congregation, and when they pour out their Souls in &s;ecret to him, who &s;eeth all the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, they are continually a&s;hamed of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ering Thoughts, or of the Deadne&s;s and Dul|ne&s;s of their Affections: Yet there is no Con|demnation to them &s;till, either from God or from their own Heart. The Con&s;ideration of the&s;e manifold Defects only gives them a deeper
<PB N="159" REF="028060_0150_0FD68B4665D0E880">Sen&s;e, That they have always need of that Blood of Sprinkling, which &s;peaks for them in the Ears of God, and that Advocate with the Father <HI>who ever liveth, to make Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ion for them.</HI> So far are the&s;e from driving them away from him, in whom they have believed, that they rather drive them the clo&s;er to him, whom they feel the Want of every Moment.

<P N="9">9. They are not condemned, Fifthly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Sins of Infirmity,</HI> as they are u&s;ually called. (Perhaps it were advi&s;eable rather to call them <HI>Infirmities,</HI> that we may not &s;eem to give any Countenance to Sin, or to extenuate it in any Degree, by thus coupling it with Infirmity. But if we mu&s;t re|tain &s;o ambiguous and dangerous an Expre&s;&s;ion) by <HI>Sins of Infirmity</HI> I would mean, &s;uch involun|tary Failings, as the &s;aying a Thing we believe True, tho' in Fact it prove to be Fal&s;e; or the Hurting our Neighbour, without knowing or de|&s;igning it; perhaps when we de&s;igned to do him Good. Tho' the&s;e are Deviations from the holy and acceptable and perfect will of God, yet they are not properly Sins, nor do they bring any Guilt on the Con&s;cience of <HI>them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> They &s;eparate not between God and them, neither intercept the Light of his Countenance; as being no Ways incon&s;i&s;tent with their general Character, of <HI>walking not after the Fle&s;h but after the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. La&s;tly, <HI>There is no Condemnation</HI> to them for any Thing whatever, which it is not in their Power to help; whether it be of an inward or
<PB N="160" REF="028060_0151_0FD68B490923A150">outward Nature, and whether it be doing &s;ome|thing, or leaving &s;omething undone. For In|&s;tance: The Lord's Supper is to be admini&s;tered. But you do not partake thereof. Why do you not? You are con&s;ined by Sickne&s;s. Therefore you cannot help omitting it: And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, you are not condemned. There is no Guilt; becau&s;e there is no Choice. As there <HI>is a willing Mind, it is accepted, according to that a Man hath, not according to that he hath not.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. A Believer indeed may &s;ometimes be <HI>griev|ed,</HI> becau&s;e he cannot do what his Soul longs for. He may cry out, when he is detained from wor|&s;hipping God in the great Congregation, <HI>Like as the Hart panteth after the Water brooks, &s;o pant|eth my Soul after thee, O</HI> God. <HI>My Soul is a|thir&s;t for</HI> God, <HI>yea even for the living</HI> God: <HI>when &s;hall I come to appear in the Pre&s;ence of</HI> God? He may earne&s;tly de&s;ire (only &s;till &s;aying in his Heart, Not as I will, but as thou wilt) to <HI>go again with the Multitude and bring them forth into the Hou&s;e of</HI> God. But &s;till, if he cannot go, he feels no Condemnation, no Guilt, no Sen&s;e of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure: But can chearfully yield up tho&s;e De&s;ires, with <HI>O my Soul, put thy Tru&s;t in</HI> God: <HI>For I will yet give him Thanks, who is the Help of my Countenance and my</HI> God.</P>
<P N="12">12. It is more difficult to determine concerning tho&s;e which are u&s;ually &s;tiled, <HI>Sins of Surprize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> As when one who commonly in Patience po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es his Soul, on a Sudden and violent Temp|tation, &s;peaks or acts in a manner not con&s;i&s;tent with the Roval Law. <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|hour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Perhaps it is not ea&s;y to fix a General Rule, concerning Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this Nature. We cannot &s;ay, either that Men are,
<PB N="161" REF="028060_0152_0FD68B4B99A03228">or that they are not condemned, for Sins of Sur|prize in general. But it &s;eems whenever a Be|liever is by Surprize over-taken in a Fault, there is more or le&s;s Condemnation, as there is more or le&s;s Concurrence of his Will. In Proportion as a &s;inful De&s;ire or Word or Action is more or le&s;s voluntary, &s;o we may conceive, God is more or le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed, and there is more or le&s;s Guilt upon the Soul.</P>
<P N="13">13. But if &s;o, then there may be &s;ome Sins of Surprize, which bring much Guilt and Condem|nation. For in &s;ome In&s;tances, our being &s;ur|prized is owing to &s;ome wilful and culpable Neg|lect; or to a Sleepine&s;s of Soul which might have been prevented, or &s;haken off before the Temp|tation came. A Man may be previou&s;ly warned either of God or Man, That Trials and Danger are at hand: And yet may &s;ay in his Heart, <HI>A little more Slumber, a little more Folding of the Hands to Re&s;t.</HI> Now if &s;uch an one afterwards fall tho' unawares, into the Snare which he might have avoided; that he fell unawares is no Ex|cu&s;e: He might have fore&s;een, and have &s;hunned the Danger. The falling even by Surprize, in &s;uch an In&s;tance as this, is, in effect, a wilful Sin; and as &s;uch mu&s;t expo&s;e the Sinner to Con|demnation, both from God and his own Con&s;ci|ence.</P>
<P N="14">14. On the other Hand, there may be &s;udden A&s;&s;aults, either from the World, or the God of this World, and frequently from our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> evil Hearts, which we did not, and hardly could fore|&s;ee. And by the&s;e even a Believer, while weak in Faith, may po&s;&s;ibly be borne down, &s;uppo&s;t into a Degree of Anger, or thinking evil of an|other,
<PB N="162" REF="028060_0153_0FD68B4B9DADE298">with &s;carce any Concurrence of his Will. Now in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Jealous God would un|doubtedly &s;hew him that he had done fooli&s;hly. He would be convinced of having &s;werved from the Perfect Law, from the Mind which was in Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently <HI>grieved</HI> with a godly Sorrow, and lovingly <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> before God. Yet need he not come into condemnation.

<P N="3">III. 1. It remains only, to draw &s;ome practi|cal Inferences from the preceeding Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, If there be <HI>no Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and walk not after the Fle&s;h but after the Spirit,</HI> on account of their pa&s;t Sin: Then why art thou fearful, O thou of little Faith? Tho' thy Sins were once more in Num|ber than the Sand, what is that to thee now thou art in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the Charge of</HI> God's <HI>Elect?

<P N="2">2. Wilt thou &s;ay, "But I have again com|mitted Sin, &s;ince I had Redemption through his Blood? And therefore it is, that <HI>I abhor my&s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI>" It is meet thou &s;hould&s;t abhor thy&s;elf; and it is God who hath wrought thee to this &s;elf-&s;ame Thing. But do&s;t thou now believe? Hath he again enabled thee to &s;ay, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth: And the Life which I now live, I live by Faith in the Son of</HI> God? Then that Faith again cancels all that is pa&s;t, and there is no Condemnation to thee. At what&s;oever Time thou truly believe&s;t in the Name of the Son of God, all thy Sins antecedent to that Hour, vani&s;h away as the Morning Dew. Now then, <HI>Stand thou fa&s;t in the Liberty where|with Chri&s;t hath made thee free.</HI> He hath once more made thee free from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt and Puni&s;hment of it. <HI>O be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage!</HI> Neither the vile devili&s;h Bondage of Sin; of evil De&s;ires, evil Tempers, or Words or Works, the mo&s;t grievous Yoke on this Side Hell; Nor the Bondage of &s;lavi&s;h tormenting Fear, of Guilt and Self-condemnation.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, Secondly: Do all they which abide <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit?</HI> Then we cannot but infer, that who|&s;oever now committeth Sin, hath no Part or Lot in this Matter. He is even now condemned by his own Heart. But <HI>if our Heart condemn us,</HI> if our own Con&s;cience beareth Witne&s;s that we are guilty, undoubtedly God doth: For <HI>he is greater
<PB N="164" REF="028060_0155_0FD68B503B85C330">than our Heart, and knoweth all Things;</HI> &s;o that we cannot doceive him, if we can our&s;elves. And think not to &s;ay, "I was ju&s;tified once; my Sins were once forgiven me." I know not that: Neither will I di&s;pute whether they were or no. Perhaps, at this Di&s;tance of Time, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible to know with any tolerable Degree of Certainty, whether that was a true, genuine Work of God, or whether thou did&s;t only de|ceive thy own Soul. But this I know with the utmo&s;t Degree of Certainty, <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> Therefore thou art of thy Father the Devil. It cannot be denied: For the Works of thy Father thou do&s;t. O flatter not thy&s;elf with vain Hopes. Say not to thy Soul, Peace, Peace! For there is no Peace. Cry a|loud! Cry unto God out of the Deep; if haply he may hear thy Voice. Come unto him as at fir&s;t, as wretched and poor, as &s;inful, mi&s;erable, blind and naked. And beware thou &s;uffer thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ul to take no Re&s;t, till his pardoning Love be again revealed, till he <HI>heal thy Back&s;lidings,</HI> and fill thee again with the <HI>Faith that worketh by Love.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Thirdly, Is there no Condemnation to them which <HI>walk after the Spirit,</HI> by rea&s;on of <HI>inward Sin</HI> &s;till remaining, &s;o long as they do not give Way thereto; nor by rea&s;on of <HI>Sin cleaving</HI> to all they do?

And be not afraid to know all this Evil of thy Heart, to know thy&s;elf as al&s;o thou art known. Yea, de&s;ire of God, that thou may&s;t

<HEAD>The Spirit of Bondage and of Adoption. A SERMON On ROMANS viii. 15.</HEAD>
<PB N="171" REF="028060_0160_0FD68B5AAF87D4D8">
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. viii. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear: But ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. ST. <HI>PAUL</HI> here &s;peaks to tho&s;e who are the Children of God by Faith, Ye, &s;aith he, who are indeed his Children, have drank into his Spirit. <HI>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear.</HI> But <HI>becau&s;e ye are Sons,</HI> God <HI>hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts. Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Spirit of Bondage and Fear is widely di&s;tant from this loving Spirit of Adoption. Tho&s;e who are influenced only by &s;lavi&s;h Fear, cannot be termed, The Sons of God. Yet &s;ome of them may be &s;tyled his Servants, and are <HI>not far from the Kinddom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But it is to be feared, the Bulk of Man|kind, yea, of what is called <HI>The Chri&s;tian World,</HI> have not attain'd even this; but are &s;till afar off, <HI>neither is</HI> God <HI>in all their Thoughts.</HI> A few Names may be found of tho&s;e who love God: A few more there are that fear him. But the greater Part have neither the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor the Love of God in their Hearts.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="172" REF="028060_0161_0FD68B5F8E6EA420">
4. Perhaps mo&s;t of you, who by the Mercy of God, now partake of a better Spirit, may re|member the Time, when ye were as they, when ye were under the &s;ame Condemnation. But at fir&s;t ye knew it not, tho' ye were wallowing daily in your Sins and in your Blood: Till in due time ye <HI>received the Spirit of Fear</HI> (<HI>ye received;</HI> for this al&s;o is the Gift of God:) And afterwards, Fear vani&s;hed away, and the Spirit of Love filled your Hearts.</P>
<P N="5">5. One who is in the fir&s;t State of Mind, without Fear or Love, is in Scripture termed <HI>a natural Man.</HI> One who is under the Spirit of Bondage and Fear, is &s;ometimes &s;aid to be <HI>under the Law:</HI> (Altho' that Expre&s;&s;ion more frequent|ly &s;ignifies One, who is under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;|pen&s;ation, who thinks him&s;elf obliged to ob&s;erve all the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Law.</HI>) But one who has exchanged the Spirit of Fear for the Spirit of Love, is properly &s;aid, To be <HI>under Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Now becau&s;e it highly imports us, to know what Spirit we are of, I &s;hall endeavour to point out di&s;tinctly, Fir&s;t, The State of a <HI>natural Man,</HI> Secondly, That of one who is <HI>under the Law,</HI> and Thirdly, of one who is <HI>under Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, Fir&s;t, the State of a <HI>natural Man.</HI> This the Scripture repre&s;ents as a State of Sleep. The Voice of God to him is, <HI>Awake, thou that &s;leepe&s;t.</HI> For his Soul is in a deep Sleep. His Spi|ritual Sen&s;es are not awake: They di&s;cern neither Spiritual Good nor Evil. The Eyes of his Un|der&s;tanding are clo&s;ed; they are &s;ealed together, and &s;ee not. Clouds and Darkne&s;s continually
<PB N="173" REF="028060_0162_0FD68B62E830E8F0">re&s;t upon them; for he lies in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hence having no Inlets for the Knowledge of Spiritual Things, all the Ave|nues of his Soul being &s;hut up, he is in gro&s;s, &s;tupid Ignorance of whatever he is mo&s;t con|cerned to know. He is utterly ignorant of God, knowing nothing concerning him as he ought to know. He is totally a Stranger to the Law of God, as to its True, Inward, Spiritual Mean|ing. He has no Conception of that Evangelical Holine&s;s, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord; nor of the Happine&s;s, which they only find, who&s;e <HI>Life is hid with Chri&s;t in</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. And for this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e he is fa&s;t <HI>a&s;leep,</HI> he is, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, at <HI>Re&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e he is <HI>blind,</HI> he is al&s;o <HI>&s;ecure:</HI> He &s;aith, <HI>Tu&s;h, there &s;hall no Harm happen unto me.</HI> The Darkne&s;s which covers him on every Side, keeps him in a kind of Peace: (So far as Peace can con&s;i&s;t with the Works of the Devil, and with an earthly, devili&s;h Mind.) He <HI>&s;ees</HI> not that he &s;tands on the Edge of the Pit; therefore he <HI>fears</HI> it not. He cannot <HI>tremble</HI> at the Danger he does not <HI>know.</HI> He has not under&s;tanding enough to fear. Why is it that he is in no Dread of God? Be|cau&s;e he is totally ignorant of him: If not <HI>&s;aying in his Heart, There is no</HI> God, or that he <HI>&s;itteth on the Circle of the Heavens, and humbleth</HI> not <HI>him&s;elf to behold the Things</HI> which are done on Earth: yet &s;atisfying him&s;elf as well, to all <HI>Epi|curean</HI> Intents and Purpo&s;es, by &s;aying, "God is Merciful:" Confounding and &s;wallowing up at once, in that unweildly Idea of Mercy, all his Holine&s;s and E&s;&s;ential Hatred of Sin, all his Ju|&s;tice, Wi&s;dom and Truth. He is in no Dread
<PB N="174" REF="028060_0163_0FD68B645BB2C648">of the Vengeance denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who obey not the ble&s;&s;ed Law of God, becau&s;e he under&s;tands it not. He imagines the main Point is, To <HI>do thus,</HI> to be <HI>outwardly</HI> blamele&s;s: And &s;ees not that it extends to every Temper, De&s;ire, Thought, Motion of the Heart. Or he fancies, that the Obligation hereto is cea&s;ed; that Chri&s;t came to <HI>de&s;troy the Law and the Prophets;</HI> to &s;ave his People, <HI>in,</HI> not <HI>from</HI> their Sins; to bring them to Heaven, without Holine&s;s. Not|with&s;tanding his own Words, <HI>Not one Jot or Tittle of the Law &s;hall pa&s;s away, till all Things are fulfilled:</HI> And, <HI>Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord! &s;hall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He is &s;ecure, becau&s;e he is utterly ignorant of him&s;elf. Hence he talks of "repenting by and by," he does not indeed exactly know when; but &s;ome time or other before he dies: Taking it for granted, That this is quite in his own Power. For what &s;hould hinder his doing it, if he will? If he does but once &s;et a Re&s;olution, no fear but he will make it good.</P>
<P N="4">4. But this Ignorance never &s;o &s;trongly glares, as in tho&s;e who are termed, <HI>Men of Learning,</HI> If a Natural Man be one of the&s;e, he can talk at large of his Rational Faculties; of the Freedom of his Will, and the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch Freedom, in order to con&s;titute a Man a Moral Agent. He reads and argues, and proves to a Demon&s;tration, That every Man may do as he will; may di&s;po&s;e his own Heart to Evil or Good, as it &s;eems be&s;t in his own Eyes. Thus the God of this World &s;preads a double Veil of Blindne&s;s
<PB N="175" REF="028060_0164_0FD68B65DC2C6318">over I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. Heart, le&s;t by any Means <HI>the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;hine</HI> upon it.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the &s;ame Ignorance of him&s;elf and God there may &s;ometimes ari&s;e in the Natural Man, a kind of <HI>Joy,</HI> in congratulating him&s;elf, upon his own Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. And what the World calls Joy, he may often po&s;&s;e&s;s. He may have Plea&s;ure in various Kinds; either in gratifying the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h, or the De&s;ire of the Eye, or the Pride of Life: Particularly if he has large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; if he enjoy an affluent Fortune. Then he may <HI>cloath</HI> him&s;elf <HI>in Purple and fine Linen, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every Day.</HI> And <HI>&s;o long as</HI> he thus <HI>doth well unto him&s;elf, Men will</HI> doubtle&s;s <HI>&s;peak good of</HI> him. They will &s;ay, He is a happy Man: For indeed this is the Sum of Wordly Happine&s;s: To dre&s;s, and vi&s;it, and talk, and eat, and drink, and ri&s;e up to play.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, if one in &s;uch Circum|&s;tances as the&s;e, dozed with the Opiates of Flat|tery and Sin, &s;hould imagine, among his other waking Dreams, That he walks in great <HI>Liberty.</HI> How ea&s;ily may he per&s;uade him&s;elf, that he is at Liberty from all <HI>Vulgar Errors,</HI> and from the <HI>Prejudice</HI> of Education, judging exactly right, and keeping clear of all Extremes. "I am free (may he &s;ay) from all the <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> of weak and narrow Souls: From <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> the Di&s;ea&s;e of Fools and Cowards, always righteous over much; and from <HI>Bigotry,</HI> continually incident to tho&s;e who have not a free and generous Way of Think|ing." And too &s;ure it is, That he is altogether free, from the <HI>Wi&s;dom which cometh from Above,</HI> from Holine&s;s, from the Religion of the Heart, from the whole Mind which was in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="176" REF="028060_0165_0FD68B68240F27C8">
7. For all this Time, he is the Servant of Sin. He commits Sin, more or le&s;s Day by Day. Yet he is not troubled: He "is in no Bondage;" (as &s;ome &s;peak) he feels no Condemnation. He con|tents him&s;elf, (even tho' he &s;hould profe&s;s to be|lieve, that the Chri&s;tian Revelation is of God?) with, "Man is frail. We are all weak. Every Man has his Infirmity." Perhaps he quotes Scrip|ture: "Why, does not <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ay, "Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Righteous Man falls into Sin &s;even Times a Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. And doubtle&s;s, they are all Hypocrites or Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts who pretend to be better than their Neigh|bours." If at any Time a &s;erious Thought fixes upon him, he &s;tifles it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, with, "Why &s;hould I fear, &s;ince God is merciful, and Chri&s;t died for Sinners?" Thus he remains a willing Servant of Sin, content with the Bon|dage of Corruption; inwardly and outwardly un|holy, and &s;atisfied therewith; not only not con|quering Sin, but not &s;triving to conquer, parti|cularly That Sin, which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et him.</P>
<P N="8">8. Such is the State of every <HI>Natural Man;</HI> whether he be a gro&s;s, &s;candalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, or a more reputable and decent Sinner, having the Form, tho' not the Power of Godline&s;s. But how can &s;uch an one be <HI>convinced of Sin?</HI> How is he brought to <HI>repent?</HI> To be <HI>under the Law?</HI> To receive the <HI>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear?</HI> This is the Point which is next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. By &s;ome awful Providence, or by his Word applied with the Demon&s;tration of his Spi|rit, God touches the Heart of him that lay a&s;leep in Darkne&s;s and in the Shadow of Death. He is
<PB N="177" REF="028060_0166_0FD68B6829879780">terribly &s;haken out of his Sleep, and awakes into a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his Danger. Perhaps in a Mo|ment, perhaps by Degrees, the Eyes of his Un|der&s;tanding are opened, and now fir&s;t (the Veil being in Part removed) di&s;cern the real State he is in. Horrid Light breaks in upon his Soul; &s;uch Light, as may be conceived to gleam from the bottomle&s;s Pit, from the lowe&s;t Deep, from a Lake of Fire, burning with Brim&s;tone. He at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ees the Loving, the Merciful God, is al&s;o <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">con&s;uming Fire;</HI> that he is a ju&s;t God and a ter|rible, rendering to every Man according to his Works, entering into Judgment with the Ungodly for every idle Word, yea, and for the Imagina|tions of the Heart. He now clearly perceives, that the great and holy God is <HI>of purer Eyes than is behold Iniquity;</HI> that he is an Avenger of every one who rebelleth again&s;t him, and repayeth the Wicked to his Face; and that <HI>it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living</HI> God.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Inward, Spiritual Meaning of the Law of God now begins to glare upon him. He per|ceives the <HI>Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> and <HI>there is nothing hid from the Light thereof.</HI> He is convinced, that every Part of it relates not barely to outward Sin or Obedience, but to what pa&s;&s;es in the &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the Soul, which no Eye but God's can penetrate. If he now hears, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> God &s;peaks in Thunder, <HI>He that hateth his Brother is a Murtherer.</HI> He that &s;aith unto his Brother, <HI>Thou Fool, is obnoxious to Hell-Fire.</HI> If the Law &s;ay, <HI>Thou &s;halt not commit Adul|tery,</HI> the Voice of the Lord &s;ounds in his Ears, <HI>He that looketh on a Woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his
<PB N="178" REF="028060_0167_0FD68B6D0D3178D0">Heart.</HI> And thus in every Point, he feels the Word of God, <HI>quick and powerful, &s;harper than a two-edged Sword.</HI> It pierces even <HI>to the divid|ing a&s;under of</HI> his <HI>Soul and Spirit,</HI> his <HI>Joints and Marrow.</HI> And &s;o much the more, becau&s;e he is con&s;cious to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> of having neglected &s;o great Salvation; of having <HI>trodden under Foot the Son of</HI> God, who would have &s;aved him from his Sins, and <HI>counted the Blood of the Covenant an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> holy,</HI> a common, un&s;anctifying, <HI>Thing.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And as he knows <HI>all Things are naked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> &s;o he &s;ees him&s;elf, naked, &s;tript of all the Fig-leaves which he had &s;ewed together, of all his poor Pretences to Religion or Virtue, and his wretched Excu&s;es for &s;inning again&s;t God. He now &s;ees him&s;elf like the ancient Sacrifices, <GAP DESC="foreign">, cleft in &s;under, as it were, from the Neck downward, &s;o that all within him &s;tands confe&s;t. His Heart is bare, and he &s;ees it is all Sin, <HI>deceitful above all Things, de&s;perately wicked;</HI> that it is altogether corrupt and abominable, more than it is po&s;&s;ible for Tongue to expre&s;s: that there dwelleth therein no good Thing, but Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ungodline&s;s only; every Motion thereof, every Temper and Thought, being only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> continually.</P>
<P N="5">5. And he not only &s;ees, but feels in him&s;elf, by an Emotion of Soul which he cannot de&s;cribe, that for the Sins of his Heart, were his Life with|out Blame (which yet it is not, and cannot be: &s;eeing <HI>an evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit</HI>) he de&s;erves to be ca&s;t into <HI>the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched.</HI> He feels, that the <HI>Wages,</HI> the ju&s;t Reward <HI>of Sin,</HI> of his Sin above all, <HI>is Death;</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="028060_0168_0FD68B708A418CA0">even the Second Death, the Death which dieth not, the De&s;truction of Body and Soul in Hell.</P>
<P N="6">6. Here ends his plea&s;ing Dream, his delu&s;ive Re&s;t, his fal&s;e Peace, his vain Security His Joy now vani&s;hes as a Cloud; Plea&s;ures, once loved, delight no more. They pall upon the Ta&s;te; he loaths the nau&s;eous Sweet; he is weary to bear them. The &s;hadows of Happine&s;s flee away, and &s;ink into Oblivion. So that he is &s;tript of all, and wanders to and fro, &s;eeking Re&s;t, but find|ing none.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Fumes of tho&s;e Opiates being now di&s;|pelled, he feels the Angui&s;h of a wounded Spirit. He finds that Sin let loo&s;e upon the Soul (whe|ther it be Pride, Anger, or Evil De&s;ire, whether Self-will, Malice, Envy, Revenge, or any other) is perfect Mi&s;ery. He feels Sorrow of Heart for the Ble&s;&s;ings he has lo&s;t, and the Cur&s;e which is come upon him; Remor&s;e &s;or having thus de|&s;troyed him&s;elf, and de&s;pi&s;ed his own Mercies; Fear,from a lively Sen&s;e of the Wrath of God, and of the Con&s;equences of his Wrath; of the Puni&s;hment which he has ju&s;tly de&s;erved, and which he &s;ees hanging over his Head; Fear of Death, as being to him the Gate of Hell, the Entrance of Death eternal; Fear of the Devil, the Executioner of the Wrath and righteous Ven|geance of God; Fear of Men, who if they were able to kill his Body, would thereby plunge both Body and Soul into Hell; Fear, &s;ometimes ari&s;|ing to &s;uch a Heighth, that the poor, &s;inful, guilty Soul, is terrified with every Thing, with Nothing, with Shades, with a Leaf &s;haken of the Wind. Yea &s;ometimes it may even border upon Di&s;traction, making a Man <HI>drunken, tho' not with Wine,</HI> &s;u&s;|pending

<P N="5">5. And <HI>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iberty;</HI> Liberty not only from Guilt and Fear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from Sin, from that heavie&s;t of all Yokes, that ba&s;e&s;t of all Bondage.

<P N="6">6.

IV. 1. From this plain account of the three|fold State of Man, the <HI>Natural,</HI> the <HI>Legal,</HI> and the <HI>Evangelical,</HI> it appears, that it is not &s;ufficient, to divide Mankind, into Sincere and In&s;incere. A Man may be &s;incere in any of the&s;e States; not only when he has the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> but while he has the <HI>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear.</HI> Yea, while he has neither this Fear, nor Love. For undoubtedly there may be &s;incere Heathens, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell as &s;incere <HI>Jews</HI> or Chri&s;tians. This Cir|cum&s;tance then, does by no means prove, that a Man is in a State of Acceptance with God.</P>
<P><HI>Examine your&s;elves</HI> therefore, not only whether ye are &s;incere, <HI>but whether ye be in the Faith.</HI> Examine narrowly; for it imports you much. What is the ruling Principle in your Soul? Is it the Love of God? Is it the Fear of God? Or is it neither one nor the other? Is it not rather, the Love of the World? the Love of Plea&s;ure? or Gain? of Ea&s;e, or Reputation? if &s;o, you are not come &s;o far as a <HI>Jew.</HI> You are but a <HI>Heathen</HI> &s;till. Have you Heaven in your Heart? Have you the Spirit of Adoption, ever crying, <HI>Abba, Father?</HI> Or do you cry unto God, as <HI>out of the Belly of Hell,</HI> overwhelmed with Sorrow and Fear? Or are you a Stranger to this whole Affair, and cannot imagine what I mean? Hea|then, pull off the Ma&s;k. Thou ha&s;t never put on Chri&s;t. Stand barefaced. Look up to Hea|ven. And own before Him that liveth for e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and ever, thou ha&s;t no Part either among the Sons or Servants of God.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="028060_0177_0FD68B8863F903D0">
Who&s;oever thou art, Do&s;t thou commit Sin, or do&s;t thou not? If thou do&s;t, is it willingly or unwillingly? In either ca&s;e God hath told thee who&s;e thou art, <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> If thou committe&s;t it willingly, thou art his Faithful Servant. He will not fail to reward thy Labour. If unwillingly, &s;till thou art his Servant. God deliver thee out of his Hands!</P>
<P>Art thou daily fighting again&s;t all Sin? and daily more than Conqueror? I acknowledge thee for a Child of God. O &s;tand fa&s;t in thy glori|ous Liberty. Art thou fighting, but not con|quering; &s;triving for the Ma&s;tery, but not able to attain? Then thou art not yet a Believer in Chri&s;t; but follow on; and thou &s;halt know the Lord. Art thou not fighting at all, but leading an ea&s;y, indolent, fa&s;hionable Life? O how ha&s;t thou dared to Name the Name of Chri&s;t? Only to make it a Reproach among the Heathen? Awake thou Sleeper! Call upon thy God: Before the Deep &s;wallow thee up.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps one Rea&s;on why &s;o many think of them&s;elves more highly than they ought to think, why they do not di&s;cern what State they are in, is, becau&s;e the&s;e &s;everal States of Soul, are often mingled together, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure meet, in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on. Thus Experience &s;hews, that the legal State, or State of Fear, is frequently mixt with the Natural. For few Men are &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep in Sin, but they are &s;ometimes, more or le&s;s awakened. As the Spirit of God does not <HI>wait for the Call of Man,</HI> &s;o at &s;ome times he <HI>will</HI> be heard. He puts them in Fear, &s;o that for a Sea&s;on, at lea&s;t, the Heathen <HI>know
<PB N="189" REF="028060_0178_0FD68B8B930FBAF0">them&s;elves to be but Men.</HI> They feel the Burthen of Sin, and earne&s;tly de&s;ire to flee from the Wrath to come. But not long. They &s;eldom &s;uffer the Arrows of Conviction to go deep into their Souls; but quickly &s;tifle the Grace of God, and return to their Wallowing in the Mire.</P>
<P>In like Manner, the Evangelical State, or State of Love, is frequently mixt with the Legal. For few of tho&s;e who have the Spirit of Bondage and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, remain always without Hope. The wi&s;e and gracious God rarely &s;uffers this; for he re|membereth that we are but Du&s;t. And he willeth not that <HI>the Fle&s;h &s;hould fail before him, or the Spirit which he hath made.</HI> Therefore at &s;uch Times as he &s;eeth Good, he gives a Dawning of Light unto them that &s;it in Darkne&s;s. He cau&s;es a Part of his Goodne&s;s to pa&s;s before them, and &s;hews he is a God <HI>that heareth the Prayer.</HI> They &s;ee the Promi&s;e which is by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, tho' it yet be afar off: And hereby they are encou|raged to <HI>run with Patience the Race which is &s;et before them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another Rea&s;on why many deceive them|&s;elves, is becau&s;e they do not con&s;ider, how far a Man may go, and yet be in a Natural, or at be&s;t a Legal State. A Man may be of a compa&s;&s;ionate and a benevolent Temper, he may be affable, courteous, generous, friendly; he may have &s;ome Degree of Meekne&s;s, Patience, Temperance, and of many other moral Virtues. He may feel many De&s;ires of &s;haking off all Vice, and attain|ing higher Degrees of Virtue. He may ab&s;tain from much Evil; perhaps from all that is gro&s;ly contrary to Ju&s;tice, Mercy or Truth. He may do much Good, may feed the Hungry, cloath the
<PB N="190" REF="028060_0179_0FD68B8CD6C31E30">Naked, relieve the Widow and Fatherle&s;s. He may attend Public Wor&s;hip, u&s;e Prayer in pri|vate, read many Books of Devotion: And yet for all this, he may be a mere Natural Man, knowing neither him&s;elf nor God; equally a Stranger to the Spirit of Fear and to that of Love; having neither repented nor believed the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e there were added to all this, a deep Conviction of Sin, with much Fear of the Wrath of God; vehement De&s;ires to ea&s;t off every Sin, and to fulfil all Righteou&s;ne&s;s; frequent rejoicing in Hope, and Touches of Love often glancing upon the Soul: Yet neither do the&s;e prove a Man to be <HI>under Grace,</HI> to have True, Living, Chri&s;tian Faith, unle&s;s the Spirit of Adoption a|bide in his Heart, unle&s;s he can continually cry, Abba, Father!</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware then, thou who art called by the Name of Chri&s;t, that thou come not &s;hort of the Mark of thy high Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling. Beware thou re&s;t not, either in a Natural State, with too many that are accounted <HI>good Chri&s;tians:</HI> Or in a Legal State, wherein tho&s;e who are <HI>highly e&s;teemed of Men,</HI> are generally content to live and die. Nay, but God hath prepared better Things for thee, if thou follow on till thou attain.

<P N="1">I. 1. Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider, What is the <HI>Wit|ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Te&s;timony of our Spirit.</HI> But here I can|not but de&s;ire all tho&s;e who are for &s;wallowing up the <HI>Te&s;timony of the Spirit of</HI> God, in the <HI>rational Te&s;timony</HI> of our own Spirit, to ob&s;erve, That in this Text the Apo&s;tle is &s;o far from &s;peak|ing
<PB N="197" REF="028060_0184_0FD68B9AEE0A77F0">of the Te&s;timony of our own Spirit <HI>only,</HI> that it may be que&s;tioned, whether he &s;peaks of it <HI>at all?</HI> Whether he does not &s;peak, <HI>only</HI> of the Te&s;timony of God's Spirit? It does not appear, but the original Text may be fairly under&s;tood thus. Thus Apo&s;tle had ju&s;t &s;aid, in the preced|ing Ver&s;e, <HI>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father,</HI> and immediately &s;ubjoins, <GAP DESC="foreign"> (&s;ome Copies read <GAP DESC="foreign">) <GAP DESC="foreign">. Which may be tran&s;lated, <HI>The &s;ame Spirit beareth Witne&s;s</HI> to <HI>our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God (the Propo&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign"> only denoting, that he witne&s;&s;es this <HI>at the &s;ame time</HI> that he enables us to cry Abba, Father!) But I contend not; &s;eeing &s;o many other Texts, with the Experience of all real Chri&s;tians, &s;ufficiently evince, that there is, in every Believer, both the Te&s;timony of God's Spirit, and the Te&s;timony of his own, that he is a Child of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to the latter, the Foundation thereof is laid in tho&s;e numerous Texts of Scrip|ture, which de&s;cribe the Marks of the Children of God, and that &s;o plain, that he which run|neth may read them. The&s;e are al&s;o collected together, and placed in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, by many both ancient and modern Writers. If any need farther Light he may receive it by attend|ing on the Mini&s;try of God's Word; by medi|tating thereon before God in &s;ecret, and by con|ver&s;ing with tho&s;e who have the Knowledge of his Ways. And by the Rea&s;on or Under&s;tanding that God has given him (which Religion was de|&s;igned not to extingui&s;h, but to perfect: Accord|ing to that of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Brethren be not Chil|dren

Every Man applying tho&s;e &s;criptural Marks to him&s;elf, may know, whether he is a Child of God. Thus if he know, Fir&s;t, <HI>as many as are led by the Spirit of</HI> God, into all holy Tempers and Actions, <HI>they are the Sons of</HI> God, (for which he has the infallible A&s;&s;urance of holy Writ;) Secondly, I am thus <HI>led by the Spirit of</HI> God; he will ea&s;ily conclude, There|fore I am a <HI>Son of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Agreeable to this are all tho&s;e plain Declara|tions of St. <HI>John</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle. <HI>Hereby we know, that we do know him, if we keep his Com|mandments,</HI> Chap. ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. ver. 3. <HI>Who&s;o keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of</HI> God <HI>per|fected; hereby we know that we are in him,</HI> that we are indeed the Children of God, ver. 5. <HI>If ye know, that he is Righteous, ye know that every one that doet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Righteou&s;ne&s;s is born of him,</HI> ver. 29. <HI>We know, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">thren,</HI> Chap. iii. ver. 4. <HI>Hereby we know, that we are of the Truth, and &s;hall a&s;&s;ure our Hearts before him,</HI> ver. 18.

And, <HI>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the</HI> (obedient) <HI>Spirit which he hath given us,</HI> Chap. iii. 24.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is highly probable, there never were any Children of God, from the Beginning of the World unto this Day, who were farther advan|ced in the Grace of God, and the Knowledge of
<PB N="199" REF="028060_0186_0FD68B9E1C80A568">our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> at the Time when he wrote the&s;e Words, and the <HI>Fathers in Chri&s;t</HI> to whom he wrote. Notwith|&s;tanding which, it is evident, both the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, and all tho&s;e Pillars in God's Temple, were very far from de&s;pi&s;ing the&s;e Marks, of their being the Children of God; and that they ap|plied them to their own Souls, for the Confir|mation of their Faith. Yet all this is no other than rational Evidence; the <HI>Witne&s;s of our Spi|rit,</HI> or Rea&s;on or Under&s;tanding. It all re&s;olves into this: Tho&s;e who have the&s;e Marks, they are the Children of God. But we have the&s;e Marks: Therefore we are Children of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. But how does it appear that we have the&s;e Marks? This is a que&s;tion which &s;till remains. How does it appear, that we do love God and our Neighbour? And that we keep his Com|mandments? Ob&s;erve, that the Meaning of the Que&s;tion is, How does it appear to <HI>our&s;elves?</HI> (not to <HI>others.</HI>) I would a&s;k him then that propo&s;es this Que&s;tion, How does it appear to you, That you are alive? And that you are now in Ea&s;e and not in Pain? Are you not immediately con&s;cious of it? By the &s;ame immediate Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s you will know, if your Soul is alive to God: If you are &s;aved from the Pain of proud Wrath, and have the Ea&s;e of a meek and quiet Spirit. By the &s;ame Means you cannot but perceive, if you love, rejoice, and delight in God. By the &s;ame, you mu&s;t be directly a&s;&s;ured, if you love your Neighbour as your&s;elf; if you are kindly af|fection'd to all Mankind, and full of Gentlene&s;s and Long-Suffering. And with regard to the Outward Mark of the Children of God, which
<PB N="200" REF="028060_0187_0FD68B9FBA93F8C0">is (according to St. <HI>John</HI>) the keeping his Commandments, You undoubtedly know in your own Brea&s;t, if, by the Grace of God, it belongs to you. Your Con&s;cience informs you from Day to Day, if you do not take the Name of God within your Lips, unle&s;s with Seriou&s;ne&s;s and De|votion, with Reverence and godly Fear: If you remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy: if you honour your Father and Mother; if you do to all as you would they &s;hould do unto you: if you po&s;&s;e&s;s y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Body in Sanctification and Ho|nour: and if whether you eat or drink, you are temperate therein, and do all to the Glory of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. Now this is properly the <HI>Te&s;timony of our own Spirit;</HI> even the Te&s;timony of our Con|&s;cience, that God hath given us to be holy of Heart, and holy in outward Conver&s;ation. It is a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our having received, in and by the Spirit of Adoption, the Tempers men|tioned in the Word of God, as belonging to his adopted Children: Even, a loving Heart toward God and toward all Mankind, hanging with child-like Confidence on God our Father, de&s;ir|ing nothing but him, ca&s;ting all our Care upon him, and embracing every Child of Man, with earne&s;t tender affection; &s;o as to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y to lay down our Life for our Brother, as Chri&s;t lay down his Life for us: A Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that we are in|wardly conformed, by the Spirit of God, to the Image of his Son, and that we walk before him in Ju&s;tice, Mercy and Truth, doing the Things which are plea&s;ing in his Sight.</P>
<P N="7">7. But what is that Te&s;timony of God's Spi|rit, which is &s;uper-added to and conjoined with
<PB N="201" REF="028060_0188_0FD68BA7B85B2F60">this? How does he <HI>bear witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD.</HI> It is hard to find Words in the Language of Men, to explain <HI>the deep Things of GOD.</HI> Indeed there are none that will adequately expre&s;s, what the Children of God experience. But perhaps one might &s;ay (de&s;iring any who are taught of God, to correct, to &s;often or Strengthen the Expre&s;&s;ion.) The Te|&s;timony of the Spirit, is an inward Impre&s;&s;ion on the Soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly <HI>witne&s;&s;es to my Spirit, That I am a Child of GOD;</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath loved me, and given him&s;elf for me: That all my Sins are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. That this <HI>Te&s;timony of the Spirit of GOD</HI> mu&s;t needs, in the very Nature of Things, be antecedent to the <HI>Te&s;timony of our own Spirit,</HI> may appear from this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration. We mu&s;t be holy of Heart and holy in Life, before we can be con&s;cious that we are &s;o; before we can have <HI>the Te&s;timony of our Spirit,</HI> that we are inwardly and outwardly Holy. But we mu&s;t love God, before we can be holy at all; this being the Root of all Holine&s;s. Now we cannot love God, till we know he loves us. <HI>We love Him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI> And we cannot know his Pardoning Love to us, till his Spirit witne&s;&s;es it to our Spirit. Since therefore this <HI>Te&s;timony of his Spirit</HI> mu&s;t precede the Love of God and all Holine&s;s, of Con&s;equence it mu&s;t precede our in|ward Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s thereof, or, the <HI>Te&s;timony of our Spirit</HI> concerning them.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="202" REF="028060_0189_0FD68BA8B2E196C8">
9. Then, and not till then, when the Spirit of God beareth that Witne&s;s to our Spirit, "God hath loved thee, and given his own Son to be the Propitiation for thy Sins; the Son of God hath loved thee, and hath wa&s;hed thee from thy Sins in his Blood:" <HI>We love</HI> God, <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us,</HI> and for his Sake we <HI>love our Brother al&s;o.</HI> And of this we cannot but be con&s;cious to our&s;elves: We <HI>know the Things that are freely given to us of</HI> God. We know that we love God and keep his Com|mandments. And <HI>hereby al&s;o we know that we are of</HI> God. This is that Te&s;timony of our own Spirit; which, &s;o long as we continue to love God and keep his Commandments, continues joined with the Te&s;timony of God's Spirit, <HI>that we are the Children of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Not that I would, by any means, be un|der&s;tood, by any Thing which has been &s;poken concerning it, to exclude the Operation of the Spirit of God, even from the <HI>Te&s;timony of our own Spirit.</HI> In no wi&s;e. It is he that not only worketh in us every Manner of Thing that is good, but al&s;o &s;hines upon his own Work, and clearly &s;hews what he has wrought. According|ly this is &s;poken of by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> as one great End of our receiving the Spirit, <HI>That we may know the Things which are freely given to us of</HI> God: that he may &s;trengthen the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience, touching our <HI>Simplicity and Godly Sin|cerity,</HI> and give us to di&s;cern in a fuller and &s;tronger Light, that we now do the Things which plea&s;e him.</P>
<P N="11">11. Should it &s;till be enquired, How does the Spirit of God, <HI>bear Witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the Children of</HI> God, &s;o as to exclude all
<PB N="203" REF="028060_0190_0FD68BAA1BC1C620">Doubt, and evince the Reality of our Son&s;hip? The an&s;wer is clear, from what has been ob|&s;erved above. And fir&s;t, as to the Witne&s;s of our Spirit. The Soul as intimately and evidently per|ceives, when it loves, delights, and rejoices in God, as when it loves and delights in any Thing on Earth. And it can no more doubt, whe|ther it loves, delights and rejoices, or no, than whether it exi&s;ts, or no. If therefore this be ju&s;t Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>He that now loves God, that delights and re|joices in him, with an humble Joy, an holy Delight, and an obedient Love, is a Child of God:</P>
<P>But I thus love, delight, and rejoice in God;</P>
<P>Therefore I am a Child of God: Then a Chri&s;tian can in no wi&s;e doubt, of his being a Child of God. Of the Former Propo|&s;ition, he has as full an A&s;&s;urance, as he has that the Scriptures are of God. And of his thus loving God, he has an Inward Proof, which is nothing &s;hort of Self-evidence. Thus the <HI>Te&s;ti|mony of our own Spirit</HI> is with the mo&s;t intimate Conviction manife&s;ted to our Hearts; in &s;uch a Manner, as beyond all rea&s;onable Doubt, to e|vince the Reality of our Son&s;hip.</P>
<P N="12">12. The <HI>Manner</HI> how the Divine Te&s;timony is manife&s;ted to the Heart, I do not take upon me to explain. <HI>Such Knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; I cannot attain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it. The Wind bloweth:</HI> And <HI>I hear the Sound thereof,</HI> But I cannot <HI>tell how it cometh, or whither it goeth.</HI> As no one knoweth the Things of a Man, &s;ave the Spirit of a Man that is in him; &s;o the <HI>Manner</HI> of the Things of God knoweth no one,

But the Fact we know: namely, that the Spirit of God does give a Be|liever &s;uch a Te&s;timony of his Adoption, that while it is pre&s;ent to the Soul, he can no more doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Reality of his Son&s;hip, than he can doubt the Shining of the Sun, while he &s;tands in the full Blaze of his Beams.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. How this joint Te&s;timony of God's Spirit and our Spirit, may be clearly and &s;olidly di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the Pre&s;umption of a natural Mind, and from the Delu&s;ion of the Devil, is the next Thing to be con&s;idered. And it highly im|ports all who de&s;ire the Salvation of God, to con&s;ider it with the deepe&s;t Attention, as they would not deceive their own Souls. An Error in this is generally ob&s;erved to have the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences: the rather, becau&s;e he that errs &s;eldom di&s;covers his Mi&s;take, till it is too late to remedy it.</P>
<P N="2">2. And fir&s;t, how is this Te&s;timony to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the Pre&s;umption of a natural Mind? It is certain, one who was never con|vinced of Sin, is always ready to flatter him&s;elf, and to think of him&s;elf, e&s;pecially in &s;piritual Things, more highly than be ought to think. And hence, it is in no wi&s;e &s;trange if one who is vainly puffed up by his fle&s;hy Mind, when he hears of this Privilege of true Chri&s;tians, among whom he undoubtedly ranks him&s;elf, &s;hould &s;oon work him&s;elf up into a Per&s;ua&s;ion, that he is al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;t thereof. Such In&s;tances now abound in the World, and have abounded in all Ages. How then may the real Te&s;timony of the Spirit with our Spirit, be di&s;tingui&s;hed from this damning Pre&s;umption?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="205" REF="028060_0192_0FD68BB083B733D0">
3. I an&s;wer, the Holy Scriptures abound with Marks, whereby the one may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other. They de&s;cribe in the plaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Manner the Circum&s;tance which go before, which accompany, and which follow, the true, genuine Te&s;timony of the Spirit of God with the Spirit of a Believer.

<P N="4">4. By the&s;e, one who vainly pre&s;umes on the Gift of God, might &s;urely know, if he really de|&s;ired it, that he hath been hitherto <HI>given up to a &s;trong Delu&s;ion,</HI> and &s;uffered to <HI>believe a Lie.</HI> For the Scriptures lay down tho&s;e clear, obvious Marks as preceding, accompanying and following that Gift, which a little Reflection would con|vince him, beyond all Doubt, were never found in his Soul. For In&s;tance, the Scripture de&s;cribes Repentance, or Conviction of Sin, as con&s;tantly going before this Witne&s;s of Pardon. So, <HI>Re|pent; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand,</HI> Matt iii. 2. <HI>Repent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel,</HI> Mark i. 15. <HI>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> Acts ii. 38. <HI>Re|pent ye therefore and be converted, that your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins may be blotted out,</HI> Chap. iii. 19. In Conformity whereto our Church al&s;o continually places Re|pentance, before Pardon or the Witne&s;s of it. "He pardoneth and ab&s;olveth all them that truly repent and unfeignedly believe his Holy Go&s;pel." "Almighty God&mdash;hath promi&s;ed Forgivene&s;s
<PB N="206" REF="028060_0193_0FD68BB403CDB1A0">of Sins to all of them, who with hearty Repen|tance and true Faith return unto him." But he is a Stranger even to this Repentance. He hath never known <HI>a broken and a contrite Heart. The Remembrance of</HI> his <HI>Sins</HI> was never <HI>grievous unto</HI> him, nor <HI>the Burthen of them intolerable.</HI> In re|peating tho&s;e Words, he never meant what he &s;aid; he merely paid a Compliment to God. And were it only from the Want of this previous Work of God, he hath too great Rea&s;on to be|lieve, that he hath gra&s;ped a mere Shadow, and never yet known the real Privilege of the Sons of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again, the Scriptures de&s;cribe the being born of God, which mu&s;t precede the Witne&s;s that we are his Children, as a va&s;t and mighty Change, a Change <HI>from Darkne&s;s to Light,</HI> as well as <HI>from the Power of Satan unto</HI> God: As a <HI>pa&s;&s;ing from Death unto Life,</HI> a Re&s;urrection from the Dead. Thus the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Ephe|&s;ians; You hath he quickened who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins,</HI> Chap. ii. ver. 1. And again, <HI>When we were dead in Sins, he hath quickened us together with Chri&s;t; and hath rai&s;ed us up toge|ther, and made us &s;it together, in heavenly Places, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> ver. 5.6. But what knoweth he, concerning whom we now &s;peak, of any &s;uch Change as this? He is altogether unacquainted with this whole Matter. This is a Language which he does not under&s;tand. He tells you, "He always was a Chri&s;tian. He knows no Time when he had need of &s;uch a Change." By this al&s;o, if he give him&s;elf leave to think, may he know, that he is not born of the Spirit: That he has never yet known God; but has mi&s;taken the Voice of Nature for the Voice of God.</P>

6. But waving the Con&s;ideration of whatever he has or has not experienced in Time pa&s;t; by the pre&s;ent Marks may we ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h a Child of God, from a pre&s;umptuous Self-deceiver. The Scriptures de&s;cribe that Joy in the Lord which accompanies the Witne&s;s of his Spirit, as an humble Joy, a Joy that aba&s;es to the Du&s;t; that makes a pardon'd Sinner cry out, "I am vile!

Yea, perhaps, there will &s;ometimes appear a Kind of Fiercene&s;s in his Air, his Manner of Speaking, his whole Deportment, as if he were ju&s;t going to take the Matter out of God's Hands, and him&s;elf to <HI>devour the Adver&s;aries.</HI></P>

Love rejoices to obey; to do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every Point, whatever is acceptable to the Beloved. A true Lover of God ha&s;tens to do his Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven. But is this the Character of the pre&s;umptuous Pretender to the Love of God? Nay, but his Love gives him a Liberty to di&s;obey, to break, not keep, the Command|ments of God. Perhaps when he was in Fear of the Wrath of God, the did labour to do his Will. But now looking on him&s;elf as <HI>not under the Law,</HI> he thinks he is no longer obliged to ob|&s;erve it. He is therefore le&s;s zealous of good Works, le&s;s careful to ab&s;tain from Evil; le&s;s watchful over his own Heart, le&s;s jealous over his Tongue.

It follows with undeniable Evidence, that he has not the true Te&s;timony of his own Spirit. He cannot be con&s;cious of having tho&s;e Marks which he hath not; that Lowline&s;s, Meekne&s;s, and Obedience. Nor yet can the Spirit of the God of Truth bear

<P N="8">8. Di&s;cover thy&s;elf, thou poor Self-deceiver! Thou who art confident of being a Child of God, thou who &s;aye&s;t, "I have the Witne&s;s in my&s;elf," and therefore defie&s;t all thy Enemies. Thou art weighed in the Balance and found wanting; even in the Balance of the Sanctuary. The Word of the Lord hath tried thy Soul, and proved thee to be reprobate Silver. Thou art not lowly of Heart. Therefore thou ha&s;t not received the Spirit of Je&s;us unto this Day. Thou art not gentle and meek; therefore thy Joy is nothing worth: It is not Joy in the Lord. Thou do&s;t not keep his Commandments; therefore thou love&s;t him not, neither art thou Partaker of the Holy Gho&s;t. It is con&s;equently, as certain and as evident, as the Oracles of God can make it, his Spirit doth not bear Witne&s;s with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God. O cry unto him that the Seales may fall off thine Eyes, that thou maye&s;t know thy&s;elf as thou art known; that thou maye&s;t receive the Sentence of Death in thy&s;elf, till thou hear the Voice that rai&s;es the Dead, &s;aying, "be of good Cheer: Thy Sins are forgiven; thy Faith hath made thee whole."</P>

And yet doubtle&s;s the Moment he heard that Voice, he knew it was the Voice of God. But <HI>how</HI> he knew this who is able to explain? Perhaps neither Man nor Angel.</P>
<P N="11">11. To come yet clo&s;er. Suppo&s;e God were now to &s;peak to any Soul, "Thy Sins are for|given thee." He mu&s;t be willing that Soul &s;hould know his Voice; otherwi&s;e he would &s;peak in vain. And he is able to effect this; for when|ever

<P>This is our Rejoicing, the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of <HI>GOD,</HI> we have had our Con|ver&s;ation in the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. SUCH is the Voice of every true Believer in Chri&s;t, &s;o long as he abides in Faith and Love. <HI>He that followeth me,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|eth not in Darkne&s;s:</HI> And while he hath the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, he rejoiceth therein. <HI>As</HI> he <HI>hath received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o</HI> he <HI>walketh in him.</HI> And while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> walketh in him, the Exhortation of the Apo&s;tle takes place in his Soul Day by Day, <HI>Rejoice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord always, and again I &s;ay, rejoice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But that we may not build our Hou&s;e upon the Sand, (le&s;t when the Rains de&s;cend, and the Winds blow, and the Floods ari&s;e and beat upon it, it fall, and great be the Fall thereof) I intend, in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;hew, what is the Nature and Ground of a Chri&s;tian's Joy. We know, in general, It is that happy Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that calm Satisfaction of Spirit, which ari&s;es from &s;uch a Te&s;timony of his Con&s;cience, as is here de|&s;cribed by the Apo&s;tle. But in order to under|&s;tand this the more throughly, it will be requi|&s;ite to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gh all his Words: Whence will ea&s;ily
<PB N="216" REF="028060_0202_0FD68B97F1129388">appear, both what we are to under&s;tand by <HI>Con|&s;cience,</HI> and what, by the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> thereof; and al&s;o, How he that hath this Te&s;timony rejoiceth evermore.</P>
<P N="3">3. And, fir&s;t, What are we to under&s;tand by <HI>Con&s;cience?</HI> What is the Meaning of this World that is in every one's Mouth? One would ima|gine, it was an exceeding difficult Thing, to di&s;|cover this, when we con&s;ider, how large and nu|merous Volumes have been from time to time wrote on this Subject: And how all the Trea|&s;ures of ancient and modern Learning have been ran&s;acked, in order to explain it. And yet it is to be feared, it has not received much Light from all tho&s;e elaborate Enquiries. Rather, have not mo&s;t of tho&s;e Writers puzzled the Cau&s;e, <HI>darken|ing Coun&s;el by Words without Knowledge;</HI> per|plexing a Subject, plain in it&s;elf, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood? For &s;et a&s;ide but hard Words, and every Man of an hone&s;t Heart will &s;oon under|&s;tand the Thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. God has made us Thinking Beings, ca|pable of perceiving what is pre&s;ent, and of re|flecting or looking back on what is pa&s;t. In par|ticular, we are capable of perceiving, what&s;oever pa&s;&s;es in our own Hearts or Lives; of knowing what&s;oever we feel or do; and that either while it pa&s;&s;es, or when it is pa&s;t. This we mean when we &s;ay, Man is a <HI>con&s;cious</HI> Being: He hath a <HI>Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or inward Perception, both of Things pre&s;ent and pa&s;t relating to him&s;elf, of his own Tempers and outward Behaviour. But what we u&s;ually term <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> implies &s;ome|what more than this. It is not barely, The Knowledge of our pre&s;ent, or the Remembrance
<PB N="217" REF="028060_0203_0FD68BC7B3357770">of our preceding Life. To remember, to bear witne&s;s either of pa&s;t or pre&s;ent Things, is only one, and the lea&s;t Office of Con&s;cience. Its main Bu&s;ine&s;s is to excu&s;e or accu&s;e, to approve or di&s;approve, to acquit or condemn.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some late Writers indeed have given a new Name to this, and have cho&s;e to &s;tile it, a <HI>moral Sen&s;e.</HI> But the old Word &s;eems preferable to the new, were it only on this Account, That it is more common and familiar among Men, and therefore ea&s;ier to be under&s;tood. And to Chri&s;|tians it is undeniably preferable, on another Ac|count al&s;o; namely, becau&s;e it is Scriptural; be|cau&s;e it is the Word which the Wi&s;dom of God hath cho&s;e to u&s;e in the In&s;pired Writings.</P>
<P>And according to the Meaning wherein it is generally u&s;ed there, particularly in the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> we may under&s;tand by Con&s;cience, A Faculty or Power, implanted by God in every Soul that comes into the World, of perceiving what is Right or Wrong in his own Heart or Life, in his Temper, Thoughts, Words and Actions.</P>
<P N="6">6. But what is the <HI>Rule</HI> whereby Men are to judge of Right and Wrong? Whereby their Con|&s;cience is to be directed? The Rule of Heathens, (as the Apo&s;tle teaches el&s;ewhere) is <HI>the Law written in their Hearts. The&s;e,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>not hav|ing the</HI> (outward) <HI>Law, are a Law unto them|&s;elves: Who &s;hew the Work of the Law</HI> (that which the outward Law pre&s;cribes) <HI>written in their Heart,</HI> by the Finger of God; <HI>their Con|&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s,</HI> whether they walk by this Rule, or not; <HI>and their Thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing,</HI> acquitting, de|fending
<PB N="218" REF="028060_0204_0FD68BC8DD795578">them, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 14, 15. But the Chri&s;tian Rule of Right and Wrong is the Word of God, the Writings of the Old and New Te&s;tament: All which the Prophets and <HI>Holy Men of Old</HI> wrote <HI>as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t: All</HI> that <HI>Scripture</HI> which was <HI>given by In&s;piration of</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> which <HI>is</HI> indeed <HI>pro|fitable for Doctrine,</HI> or teaching the whole Will of God: <HI>for Reproof</HI> of what is contrary there|to; <HI>for Correction</HI> of Error, <HI>and for In&s;truction</HI> (or training us up) <HI>in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 16.</P>
<P>This is <HI>a Lanthorn unto</HI> a Chri&s;tian's <HI>Feet, and a Light in all</HI> his <HI>Paths.</HI> This alone he receives as his Rule of Right or Wrong, of whatever is really Good or Evil. He e&s;teems nothing Good, but what is here enjoined, either directly or by plain Con&s;equence. He accounts nothing Evil but what is here forbidden, either in Terms, or by undeniable Inference. Whatever the Scrip|ture neither forbids nor enjoins, (either directly, or by plain Con&s;equence) he believes to be of an indifferent Nature, to be in it&s;elf neither Good nor Evil: This being the whole and &s;ole out|ward Rule, whereby his Con&s;cience is to be di|rected in all Things.</P>
<P N="7">7. And if it be directed thereby in fact, then hath he <HI>the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience toward</HI> God. A <HI>good Con&s;cience</HI> is what is el&s;ewhere termed by the Apo&s;tle, a <HI>Con&s;cience void of Of|fence.</HI> So, what he at one time expre&s;&s;es thus, <HI>I have lived in all good Con&s;cience before</HI> God <HI>until this Day,</HI> Acts xxiii. 1. he denotes at ano|ther, by that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Herein do I exerci&s;e my&s;elf, to have always a Con&s;cience void of Offence toward</HI> God <HI>and toward Man,</HI> Chap. xxiv. 16.
<PB N="219" REF="028060_0205_0FD68BCA765170F8">Now in order to this, there is ab&s;olutely required, Fir&s;t, A Right Under&s;tanding of the Word of God, of his <HI>holy and acceptable and perfect Will</HI> concerning us, as it is revealed therein. For it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould walk by a Rule, if we do not know what it means. There is, Secondly, required (which how few have attained?) a true Knowledge of our&s;elves; a Knowledge both of our Hearts and Lives, of our inward Tempers and outward Conver&s;ation: &s;eeing if we know them not, it is not po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould com|pare them with our Rule. There is required, Thirdly, an Agreement of our Hearts and Lives, of our Tempers and Conver&s;ation, of our Thoughts and Words and Works with that Rule, with the written Word of God. For without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if we have any Con&s;cience at all, it can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly an evil Con&s;cience.

<P N="8">8. But whoever de&s;ires to have a Con&s;cience thus void of Offence, let him &s;ee that he lay the right Foundation.

<P N="12">12. <HI>We have had our Conver&s;ation in the World,</HI> Secondly, <HI>in godly Sincerity.</HI> The Difference be|tween Simplicity and Sincerity &s;eems to be chiefly this: Simplicity regards the Intention it&s;elf, Sin|cerity, the Execution of it.

<P N="17">17. Such is the Ground and the Nature of that Joy, whereby a Chri&s;tian rejoiceth ever|more. And from all this we may ea&s;ily infer, Fir&s;t. That this is not a <HI>natural</HI> Joy. It does
<PB N="227" REF="028060_0213_0FD68BDDD333BDB0">not ari&s;e from any natural Cau&s;e: Not from any &s;udden Flow of Spirits. This may give a tran|&s;ient Start of Joy. But the Chri&s;tian <HI>rejoiceth al|ways.</HI> It cannot be owing to bodily Health or Ea&s;e; to Strength and Soundne&s;s of Con&s;titution. For it is equally &s;trong in Sickne&s;s and Pain; yea perhaps far &s;tronger than before. Many Chri&s;|tians have never experienced any Joy, to be com|pared with that which then &s;illed their Soul, when the Body was well nigh worn out with Pain, or con&s;umed away with pining Sickne&s;s. Lea&s;t of all can it be a&s;cribed to outward Pro&s;perity, to the Favour of Men, or Plenty of worldly Goods. For then chiefly, when their Faith has been tried as with Fire, by all Manner of outward Afflic|tions, have the Children of God rejoiced in him, <HI>whom un&s;een they loved,</HI> even <HI>with Joy un|&s;peakable.</HI> And never &s;urely did Men rejoice like tho&s;e, who were u&s;ed as <HI>the Filth and off &s;couring of the World;</HI> who wandered to and two, being in want of all Things; in Hunger, in Cold, in Nakedne&s;s: Who <HI>had Trials,</HI> not only <HI>of cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Mockings,</HI> but <HI>moreover of Bouds and Impri&s;on|ments:</HI> Yea, who at la&s;t <HI>counted not their Lives dear unto them&s;elves, &s;o</HI> they <HI>might fini&s;h their Cour&s;e with Joy.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. From the preceding Con&s;iderations, we may, Secondly, infer, That the Joy of a Chri&s;|tian does not ari&s;e from any <HI>Blindne&s;s of Con|&s;cience,</HI> from his not being able to di&s;cern Good from Evil. So far from it, that he was an utter Stranger to this Joy, till the Eyes of his Under|&s;tanding were opened! that he knew it not, un|til he had Spiritual Sen&s;es, fitted to di&s;cern &s;piri|tual Good and Evil. And now the Eye of his
<PB N="228" REF="028060_0214_0FD68BDFC9F41880">Soul waxeth not dim. He was never &s;o &s;harp-&s;ighted before. He has &s;o quick a Perception of the &s;malle&s;t Things, as is quite amazing to the natural Man. As a Mote is vi&s;ible in the Sar|beam, &s;o to him who is walking in the Light, in the Beams of the uncreated Sun, every Mote of Sin is vi&s;ible. Nor does he clo&s;e the Eyes of his Con&s;cience any more. That Sleep is departed from him. His Soul is always bread awake; No more Slumber or folding of the Hands to Re&s;t! He is always &s;tanding on the Tower, and heark|ning what his Lord will &s;ay concerning him: And always rejoicing in this very Thing, in <HI>&s;eeing him that is invi&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Neither does the Joy of a Chri&s;tian ari&s;e, Thirdly, from any <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Callou&s;ne&s;s of Con|&s;cience.</HI> A Kind of Joy, it is true, may ari&s;e from this, in tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>fooli&s;h Hearts are darken|ed;</HI> who&s;e Heart is callous, unfeeling, dull of Sen&s;e; and con&s;equently, without &s;piritual Under|&s;tanding, Becau&s;e of their &s;en&s;ele&s;s, un&s;eeling Hearts, they may rejoice even in committing Sin: And this they may probably call <HI>Liberty!</HI> Which is indeed more Drunkenne&s;s of Soul: A fatal Numbne&s;s of Spirit, the &s;tupid In&s;en&s;ibility of a &s;eared Con&s;cience. On the contrary, a Chri&s;tian has the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Sen&s;ibility; &s;uch as he could not have conceived before. He never had &s;uch a Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience as he has had, &s;ince the Love of God has reigned in his Heart. And this al&s;o is his Glory and Joy; that God hath heard his daily Prayer,
<Q><L>"O that my tender Soul might fly</L>
<L>The fir&s;t, abhorr'd Approach of Ill:</L>

20. To conclude. Chri&s;tian Joy, is Joy in Obedience: Joy in loving God and keeping his Commandments. And yet not in keeping them, as if we were thereby to fulfil the Terms of the <HI>Covenant of Works;</HI> as if by any Works or Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of ours, we were to <HI>procure</HI> Pardon and Acceptance with God.

<P N="2">2. But in Proce&s;s of time, when <HI>the Love of many waxed cold,</HI> &s;ome began to mi&s;take the <HI>Means</HI> for the <HI>End,</HI> and to place Religion, rather in doing tho&s;e outward Works, than in a Heart renewed after the Image of God. They forgot, that <HI>the End of</HI> every <HI>Commandment is Love, out of a pure Heart, with Faith unfeigned:</HI> The
<PB N="234" REF="028060_0218_0FD68BE914C60DE0">loving the Lord their God with all their Heart, and their Neighbour as them&s;elves; and the be|ing purified from Pride, Anger, and evil De&s;ires, by a <HI>Faith of the Operation of</HI> God. Others &s;eemed to imagine, that tho' Religion did not principally con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e outward Means, yet there was &s;omething in them where with God was well plea&s;ed, &s;omething that would &s;till make them acceptable in his Sight, tho' they were not exact in the weightier Matters of the Law, in Ju&s;tice, Mercy, and the Love of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is evident, in tho&s;e who abu&s;ed them thus, they did not conduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the End for which they were ordained. Rather, the Things which &s;hould have been for their Health, were to them an Occa&s;ion of falling. They were &s;o far from receiving any Ble&s;&s;ing therein, that they only drew down a Cur&s;e upon their Head: &s;o far from growing more heavenly in Heart and Life, that they were twofold more the Children of Hell than before. Others clearly perceiving, that the&s;e Means did not convey the Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God to tho&s;e Children of the Devil, began from this particular Ca&s;e to draw a General Conclu&s;ion, "That they were not Means of conveying the Grace of God."</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet the Number of tho&s;e who <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> the Ordinances of God, was far greater than of tho&s;e who <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> them, till certain Men aro&s;e, not only or great under&s;tanding, (&s;ometimes joined with con&s;iderable Learning) but who likewi&s;e ap|peared to be Men of Love, experimentally ac|quainted with true, Inward Religion.

<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e holy and ve|nerable Men, intended any more at fir&s;t, than to &s;hew that Outward Religion is nothing worth, without the Religion of the Heart: That God <HI>is a Spirit, and they who wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor|&s;hip him in Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it and in Truth:</HI> That therefore external Wor&s;hip is lo&s;t Labour, withou a Heart devoted to God: That the Outward Ordinances of God then profit much, when they advance Inward Holine&s;s, but when they advance it not, are unprofitable and void, are lighter than Vanity: Yea, that when they are u&s;ed, as it were, <HI>in the Place</HI> of This, they are an utter Abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet it is not &s;trange, if &s;ome of the&s;e, be|ing &s;trongly convinced, of that horrid Pro&s;ana|tion of the Ordinances of God, which had &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole Church, and well nigh driven True Religion out of the World; in their fervent Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Re|covery of Souls; from that fatal Delu&s;ion, &s;pake as if Outward Religion were <HI>ab&s;olutely nothing,</HI> as if it had <HI>no</HI> Place in the Religion of Chri&s;t. It is not &s;urprizing at all, if they &s;hould not always have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with &s;ufficent Caution. So that unwary Hearers might believe, they con|demned all Outward Means, as altogether un|profitable; and as not de&s;igned of God to be the Ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace into the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>Nay, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of the&s;e holy Men did at length them&s;elves fall into this Opi|nion:

<P N="6">6.

They have probably tried mo&s;t Outward Means, and found no Ea&s;e in Them: It may be, more and more of Remor&s;e and Fear, and Sorrow and Condemnation. It is ea&s;y there|fore to per&s;uade the&s;e, That it is better for them to ab&s;tain from all tho&s;e Means.

<P N="2">II. 1. In the following Di&s;cour&s;e, I propo&s;e to examine at large. Whether there are any Means of Grace?</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="028060_0221_0FD68BF22321BE70">
By <HI>Means of Grace</HI> I under&s;tand, Outward Signs, Words or Actions, ordained of God, and appointed for this End, to be the <HI>Ordinary</HI> Chan|nels whereby he might convey to Men, prevent|ing, ju&s;tifying or &s;anctifying Grace.</P>
<P>I u&s;e this Expre&s;&s;ion, "Means of Grace," be|cau&s;e I know none better, and becau&s;e it has been generally u&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian Church for many Ages: In particular, by our own Church, which directs us to ble&s;s God, both for the "<HI>Means of Grace</HI> and Hope of Glory;" and teaches us that a Sacrament is "An Outward Sign of In|ward <HI>Grace,</HI> and a <HI>Means</HI> whereby we receive the &s;ame."</P>
<P>The Chief of the&s;e Means are Prayer, whe|ther in &s;ecret, or with the great Congregation; &s;earching the Scriptures (which implies Reading, Hearing and meditating thereon) and receiving the Lord's Supper, eating Bread and drinking Wine in Remembrance of him; and the&s;e we believe to be ordained of God, as the ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. But we allow, That the whole Value of the Means depends on their actual Sub&s;ervience to the End of Religion; that con&s;equently all the&s;e Means, when &s;eparate from the End, are le&s;s than Nothing and Vanity; That if they do not actually conduce to the Knowledge and Love of God, they are not acceptable in his Sight; yea, rather, they are an Abomination before him; a Stink in his No&s;trils; he is weary to bear them, Above all, if they are u&s;ed as a kind of <HI>Commu|nion</HI> for the Religion they were de&s;igned to &s;ub&s;erve. It is not ea&s;y to find Words for the
<PB N="238" REF="028060_0222_0FD68BF40EECB978">enormous Folly and Wickedne&s;s, of thus turn|ing God's Arms again&s;t him&s;elf; of keeping Chri&s;tianity out of the Heart by tho&s;e very Means, which were ordained for the bringing it in.</P>
<P N="3">3. We allow likewi&s;e, that all Outward Means whatever, if &s;eparate from the Spirit of God, cannot profit at all, cannot conduce in any De|gree either to the Knowledge or Love of God. Without Controver&s;y, the Help that is done up|on Earth, he doth it him&s;elf. It is He alone, who by his own Almighty Power, worketh in us what is plea&s;ing in his Sight. And all out|ward Things, unle&s;s he work in them and by them, are mere weak and beggarly Elements. Who&s;oever therefore imagines, there is any In|trin&s;ic <HI>Power,</HI> in any Means what&s;oever, does greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the Power of God. We know that there is no inherent Power, in the Words that are &s;poken in Prayer; in the Letter of Scripture read, the Sound thereof heard, or the Bread and Wine received in the Lord's Supper: But that it is God alone who is the Giver of every good Gift, the Author of all Grace; that the whole Power is of him whereby thro' any of the&s;e, there is any Ble&s;&s;ing conveyed to our Soul. We know like|wi&s;e, that he is able to give the &s;ame Grace, tho' there were no Means on the Face of the Earth. In this Sen&s;e we may affirm, that "with Regard to God, there is no &s;uch Thing as Means:" Seeing he is equally able to work what&s;oever plea&s;eth him, by Any, or by None at all.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="239" REF="028060_0223_0FD68BF5313C4368">
4. We allow farther, That the U&s;e of all Means whatever, will never atone for one Sin; That it is the Blood of Chri&s;t alone, whereby any Sinner can be reconciled to God; there be|ing no other Propitiation for our Sins, no other Fountain for Sin and Uncleanne&s;s. Every Be|liever in Chri&s;t is deeply convinced, that there is no <HI>Merit,</HI> but in Him: That there is no <HI>Merit</HI> in any of his own Works; not in uttering the Prayer, or &s;earching the Scripture, or hearing the Word of God, or eating of that Bread and drinking of that Cup. So that if no more be intended by the Expre&s;&s;ion &s;ome have u&s;ed, "Chri&s;t is the only Means of Grace," than this, That he is the only <HI>Meritorious Cau&s;e</HI> of it, it cannot be gain-&s;aid by any who know the Grace of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet once more. We allow (tho' it is a melancholy Truth) that a large Proportion of tho&s;e who are called Chri&s;tians, do to this Day abu&s;e the Means of Grace, to the De&s;truction of their Souls. This is doubtle&s;s the Ca&s;e with all tho&s;e who re&s;t content, in the Form of Godli|ne&s;s without the Power. Either they fondly pre|&s;ume, they are Chri&s;tians already, becau&s;e they do thus and thus; altho' Chri&s;t was never yet re|vealed in their Hearts, nor the Love of God &s;hed abroad therein: Or el&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e, They &s;hall infallibly be &s;o, barely becau&s;e they u&s;e the&s;e Means: Idly dreaming (tho' perhaps hardly con|&s;cious thereof) either that there is &s;ome Kind of <HI>Power</HI> therein, whereby &s;ooner or later (they know not when) they &s;hall certainly be made Holy: Or that there is a Sort of <HI>Merit</HI> in u&s;ing
<PB N="240" REF="028060_0224_0FD68BF696987450">them, which will &s;urely move God to give them Holine&s;s, or accept them without it.</P>
<P N="6">6. So little do they under&s;tand that great Foundation of the whole Chri&s;tian Building, <HI>By Grace ye are &s;aved.</HI> Ye are &s;aved from your Sins, from the Guilt and Power thereof, ye are re&s;tored to the Favour and Image of God, not for any Works, <HI>Merits</HI> or De&s;ervings of yours, but by the free <HI>Grace,</HI> the mere mercy of God, thro' the <HI>Merits</HI> of his well-beloved Son. Ye are thus &s;aved, not by any <HI>Power,</HI> Wi&s;dom or Strength, which is in you, or in any other Crea|ture: but merely thro' the Grace or <HI>Power</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t, which worketh all in all.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the main Que&s;tion remains. We know this Salvation is the Gift and the Work of God. But how (may one &s;ay, who is convinced he hath it not) may I attain thereto? If you &s;ay, "Believe, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved:" He an|&s;wers, True; but how &s;hall I believe? You re|ply, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it upon God.&mdash;Well. But how am I to wait? In the Means of Grace, or out of them? Am I to wait for the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, by u&s;ing the&s;e Means, or by laying them a&s;ide?</P>
<P N="8">8. It cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived, that the Word of God &s;hould give no Direction in &s;o important a Point: Or that the Son of God, who came down from Heaven for us Men and for our Salvation, &s;hould have left us undeter|mined with regard to a Que&s;tion, wherein our Salvation is &s;o nearly concerned.</P>
<P>And in Fact, he hath not le&s;t us undetermined; he hath &s;hewn us the Way wherein we &s;hould go. We have only to con&s;ult the Oracles of
<PB N="241" REF="028060_0225_0FD68BFC9D78A1C8">God, to inquire what is written there? And if we &s;imply abide by their Deci&s;ion, there can no po&s;&s;ible Doubt remain.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. According to this, according to the Deci&s;ion of Holy Writ, all who de&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained; in u&s;ing, not in laying them a&s;ide.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t: All who de&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of <HI>Prayer.</HI> This is the expre&s;s Direction of our Lord him&s;elf. In his Sermon upon the Mount, after explaining at large wherein Religion con&s;i&s;ts, and de&s;cribing the main Branches of it, he adds, <Q>A&s;k and it &s;hall be given you, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find, knock and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that a&s;keth re|ceiveth, and he that &s;eeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it &s;hall be opened.</Q> (<HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 7, 8.) Here we are in the plaine&s;t Manner directed to a&s;k, in order to, or as a <HI>Means</HI> of receiving; to &s;eek in order to find, the Grace of God, the Pearl of great Price; and to knock, to con|tinue a&s;king and &s;eeking, if we would enter in|to his Kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no Doubt might remain, our Lord labours this Point in a more peculiar Manner. He appeals to every Man's own Heart. <Q>What Man is there of you, who if his Son a&s;k Bread, will give him a Stone? Or if he a&s;k a Fi&s;h, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ow how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more &s;hall your Father which is in Heaven,</Q> the Father of Angels and Men, the Father of the
<PB N="242" REF="028060_0226_0FD68BFF9E908238">Spirits of all Fle&s;h, <HI>give good Things to them that a&s;k him?</HI> ver. 9, 10, 11. Or, as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on another Occa&s;ion, including all good things in one, <HI>How much more &s;hall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him? Luke</HI> xi. 13. It &s;hould be particularly ob&s;erved here, that the Per&s;ons directed to a&s;k, had not then received the Holy Spirit. Neverthele&s;s our Lord directs them to u&s;e this Means, and pro|mi&s;es that it &s;hould be effectual; that upon a&s;k|ing they &s;hould receive the Holy Spirit, from him who&s;e Mercy is over all his Works.</P>
<P N="3">3. The ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing this Means, if we would receive any Gift from God, yet farther appears from that remarkable Pa&s;&s;age which immediately precedes the&s;e Words: <Q>And he &s;aid unto them</Q> (whom he had ju&s;t been teach|ing, how to pray) <Q>which of you &s;hall have a Friend, and &s;hall go unto him at Midnight, and &s;hall &s;ay unto him, Friend, lend me three Loaves&mdash; and he from within &s;hall an&s;wer, Trouble me not &mdash;I cannot ri&s;e and give thee: I &s;ay unto you, though he will not ri&s;e and give him, becau&s;e he is his Friend, yet becau&s;e of his Importunity he will ri&s;e, and give him as many as he needeth. And I &s;ay unto you, a&s;k and it &s;hall be given you,</Q> Luke xi. 5, 7, 8, 9. <Q>Though he will not give him, becau&s;e he is his Friend, yet becau&s;e of his Im|portunity he will ri&s;e and give him as many as he needeth.</Q> How could our ble&s;&s;ed Lord more plainly declare, That we may receive of God, by this Means, by importunately a&s;king, what otherwi&s;e we &s;hould not receive at all.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="243" REF="028060_0227_0FD68BFFA470ACA0">
4. <HI>He &s;pake al&s;o another Parable to this End, that Men ought always to pray, and not to faint,</HI> 'till through this Means they &s;hould receive of God, what&s;oever Petition they a&s;ked of him. <Q>There was in a city a Judge which feared not God, neither regarded Man. And there was a Widow in that City, and &s;he came unto him, &s;ay|ing, Avenge me of my Adver&s;ary. And he would not for a while; but afterwards he &s;aid with him|&s;elf, Though I fear not God, nor regard Man, yet becau&s;e this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her, le&s;t by her continual coming &s;he weary me.</Q> Luke xviii 1&mdash;4. The Application of this our Lord him&s;elf hath made. <HI>Hear what the unju&s;t Judge &s;aith!</HI> Becau&s;e &s;he continues to a&s;k, be|cau&s;e the will take no Denial, therefore I will a|venge her. <HI>And &s;hall not</HI> God <HI>avenge his own Elect, which cry Day and Night unto him? I tell you be will avenge them &s;peedily</HI>&mdash;if they <HI>pray and faint not.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. A Direction equally full and expre&s;s, to wait for the Ble&s;&s;ings of God in private Prayer, together with a po&s;itive Promi&s;e, that by this Means we &s;hall obtain the Reque&s;t of our Lips, he hath given us in tho&s;e well-known Words: <Q>Enter into thy Clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret, and thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret &s;hall reward thee openly,</Q> Matth. vi. 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. If it be po&s;&s;ible for any Direction to be more clear, it is that which God hath given us by the Apo&s;tle, with regard to Prayer of every Kind, public or private, and the Ble&s;&s;ings annext thereto. <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k
<PB N="244" REF="028060_0228_0FD68C01151BC348">of</HI> God, <HI>that giveth to all Men liberally,</HI> (if they a&s;k; otherwi&s;e <HI>ye have not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k not,</HI> Jam. iv. 2.) <HI>and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him,</HI> ch. i. 5.</P>
<P>If it be objected, "But this is no Direction to Unbelievers; to them who know not the par|doning Grace of God: For the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>But let him a&s;k in Faith:</HI> otherwi&s;e, <HI>let him not think that he &s;hall receive any Thing of the Lord."</HI> I an&s;wer, The Meaning of the Word <HI>Faith</HI> in this Place is fixed by the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, (as if it were on purpo&s;e to obviate this Objection) in the Words immediately following: <HI>Let him a&s;k in Faith, nothing wavering,</HI> nothing <HI>doubting,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. Not doubting but God hear|eth his Prayer, and will fulfil the De&s;ire of his Heart.</P>
<P>The gro&s;s, bla&s;phemous Ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;|ing <HI>Faith</HI> in this Place to be taken in the full Chri&s;tian Meaning, appears hence: It is &s;uppo&s;|ing the Holy Gho&s;t to direct a Man who knows he hath not this Faith, (which is here termed <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI>) to a&s;k it of God, with a po&s;itive Promi&s;e that <HI>it &s;hall be given him;</HI> and then immediately to &s;ubjoin, That it &s;hall not be given him, un|le&s;s he have it before he a&s;ks for it! But who can bear &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition; from this Scrip|ture, therefore, as well as tho&s;e cited above, we mu&s;t infer, that all who de&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of Prayer.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Secondly,</HI> All who de&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in <HI>&s;earching the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord's Direction with regard to the U&s;e of this Means, is likewi&s;e plain and clear. <HI>Search
<PB N="245" REF="028060_0229_0FD68C029A565710">the Scriptures,</HI> faith he to the unbelieving <HI>Jews, &mdash;for they te&s;tify of me,</HI> John v. 39. And for this very End did he direct them to &s;earch the Scriptures, that they might <HI>believe in him.</HI></P>
<P>The Objection, "That this is not a Command, but only an A&s;&s;ertion, that they did &s;earch the Scriptures," is &s;hamele&s;ly fal&s;e. I de&s;ire tho&s;e who urge it, to let us know, how a Command can be more clearly expre&s;&s;ed, than in tho&s;e Terms, <GAP DESC="foreign">. It is as peremptory as &s;o many Words can make it.</P>
<P>And what a Ble&s;&s;ing from God attends the U&s;e of this Means, appears from what is record|ed concerning the <HI>Bereans;</HI> who after hearing St. <HI>Paul, &s;earched the Scriptures daily, whether tho&s;e Things were &s;o? Therefore many of them be|lieved;</HI> found the Grace of God, in the Way which he had ordained. <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 12, 13.</P>
<P>It is probable, indeed, that in &s;ome of tho&s;e who had <HI>received the Word with all Readine&s;s of Mind, Faith came</HI> (as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;peaks) <HI>by hearing,</HI> and was only confirmed by <HI>reading</HI> the Scriptures. But it was ob&s;erved above, that under the general Term of <HI>&s;earching the Scrip|tures,</HI> both Hearing, Reading, and Meditating, are contained.</P>
<P N="8">8. And that this is a Means whereby God not only gives, but al&s;o confirms and increa&s;es true Wi&s;dom, we learn from the Words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy: From a Child thou ha&s;t known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wi&s;e unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> 2. Tim. iii. 15. The &s;ame Truth (namely, that this is the great Means God has ordained for
<PB N="246" REF="028060_0230_0FD68C0A5D6FA8E8">conveying his manifold Grace to Man) is deli|vered, in the fulle&s;t Manner that can be con|ceived, in the Words which immediately follow: <HI>All Scripture is given by In&s;piration of</HI> God; (con&s;equently, all Scripture is infallibly true;) <HI>and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: To the End that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> ver. 16, 17.</P>
<P N="9">9. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that this is &s;poken primarily and directly, of the Scriptures which <HI>Timothy</HI> had <HI>known from a Child;</HI> which mu&s;t have been tho&s;e of the Old Te&s;tament, for the New was not then wrote. How far then was St. <HI>Paul</HI> (though he was <HI>not a whit behind the very Chief of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> not therefore, I pre|&s;ume, behind any Man now upon Earth) from making light of the Old Te&s;tament! Behold this, le&s;t ye one Day <HI>wonder and peri&s;h,</HI> ye who make &s;o &s;mall Account of one Half of the Oracles of God! Yea, and that Half of which the Holy Gho&s;t expre&s;sly declares, That it is <HI>profitable,</HI> as a Means ordained of God, for this very Thing, <HI>for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In|&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: To the End the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Nor is this pro&s;itable only for the Men of God, for tho&s;e who walk already in the Light of his Countenance; but al&s;o for tho&s;e who are yet in Darkne&s;s, &s;eeking him whom they know not. Thus St. <HI>Peter, We have al&s;o a more &s;ure Word of Prophecy:</HI> (Literally, <HI>and we
<PB N="247" REF="028060_0231_0FD68C0C6AEDD288">have the prophetic Word more &s;ure:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, confirmed by our being <HI>Eye witne&s;&s;es of his Maje&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>hearing the Voice which came from the Excellent Glory) unto which</HI> (prophetic Word; &s;o he &s;tiles the holy Scriptures) <HI>ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that &s;hineth in a dark Place, until the Day down, and the Day &s;tar ari&s;e in your Hearts,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 19. Let all, therefore, who de&s;ire that Day to dawn upon their Hearts, wait for it in <HI>&s;earching the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> All who de&s;ire an Increa&s;e of the Grace of God, are to wait for it in partaking of the Lord's Supper. For this al&s;o is a Direction him&s;elf hath given. <Q>The &s;ame Night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread, and brake it, and &s;aid, Take, eat:</Q> This is my Body (that is, the &s;acred Sign of my Body) <Q>This do in Remembrance of me. Likewi&s;e, he took the Cup, &s;aying, This Cup is the New Te&s;tament, or <HI>Covenant,</HI> in my Blood, (the &s;acred &s;ign of that Covenant) this do ye, in Remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do &s;hew forth the Lord's Death till he come,</Q> 2 Cor. xi. 23, &amp;c. Ye openly exhibit the &s;ame, by the&s;e vi&s;ible Signs, before God, and Angels, and Men. Ye manife&s;t your &s;olemn Remembrance of his Death, till he cometh in the Clouds of Heaven.</P>
<P>Only <HI>let a Man</HI> fir&s;t <HI>examine him&s;elf,</HI> whether he under&s;tands the Nature and De&s;ign of this holy In&s;titution, and whether he really de&s;ire to be him&s;elf made conformable to the Death of
<PB N="248" REF="028060_0232_0FD68C0DD5FA7318">Chri&s;t: <HI>and &s;o,</HI> nothing doubting, <HI>let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</HI> ver. 28.</P>
<P>Here then the Direction fir&s;t given by our Lord, is expre&s;ly repeated by the Apo&s;tle. Let him eat; let him drink: (<GAP DESC="foreign"> both in the Imperative Mood.) Words not implying a bare Permi&s;&s;ion only, but a clear explicit Com|mand; a Command to all tho&s;e, either who al|ready are filled with Peace and Joy in believing, or who can truly &s;ay, "The Remembrance of our Sins is grievous unto us, the Burden of them is intolerable."</P>
<P N="12">12. And that this is al&s;o an ordinary &s;tated Means of receiving the Grace of God, is evi|dent from tho&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle, which occur in the preceding Chapter. <Q>The Cup of Ble&s;&s;ing which we ble&s;s, is it not the Communion, <HI>or Communication,</HI> of the Blood of Chri&s;t? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chri&s;t?</Q> (1 Cor. x. 16.) Is not the eating of that Bread, and the drinking of that Cup, the outward, vi&s;ible Means, whereby God conveys into our Souls all that Spiritual Grace, that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, which were purcha&s;ed by the Body of Chri&s;t once broken, and the Blood of Chri&s;t once &s;hed for us? Let all, therefore, who truly de&s;ire the Grace of God, eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. But as plainly as God hath pointed out the Way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nerein he will be inquired after, innumerable are the Objections which Men,
<PB N="249" REF="028060_0233_0FD68C0F68061030">wi&s;e in their own Eyes, have from Time to Time rai&s;ed again&s;t it. It may be needful to con&s;ider a few of the&s;e; not becau&s;e they are of Weight in them&s;elves, but becau&s;e they have &s;o often been u&s;ed, e&s;pecially of late Years, to turn the Lame out of the Way; yea, to trouble and &s;ubvert tho&s;e who did run well, till Satan appeared as an Angel of Light.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and Chief of the&s;e is, "You can|not u&s;e the&s;e Means (as you call them) without <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in them." I pray, where is this written? I expect you &s;hould &s;hew me plain Scripture for your A&s;&s;ertion. Otherwi&s;e I dare not receive it: Becau&s;e I am not convinced, that you are wi&s;er than God.</P>
<P>If it really had been as you a&s;&s;ert, it is certain Chri&s;t mu&s;t have known it. And if he had known it, he would &s;urely have warned us, he would have revealed it long ago. Therefore be|cau&s;e he has not, becau&s;e there is no Tittle of this in the whole Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I am as fully a&s;&s;ured your A&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e, as that this Revelation is of God.</P>
<P>"However, leave them off for a &s;hort Time, to &s;ee whether you tru&s;ted in them or no." So I am to di&s;obey God, in order to know, whether I tru&s;t in obeying him! And do you avow this Advice? Do you deliberately teach, to <HI>do Evil that Good may come?</HI> O tremble at the Sentence of God again&s;t &s;uch Teachers! Their <HI>Damna|tion is ju&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>But what do you mean by "<HI>Tru&s;ting</HI> in them?" Looking for the Ble&s;&s;ing of God therein? Be|lieving, that If I wait in this Way I &s;hall attain, what otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not?

<P N="2">2. It has been, &s;econdly, objected, "This is &s;eeking Salvation by Works." Do you know the Meaning of the Expre&s;&s;ion you u&s;e? What is, "&s;eeking Salvation by Works?" In the Writ|ings of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> it means, either &s;eeking to be &s;aved by ob&s;erving the ritual Works of the Mo&s;aic Law, or expecting Salvation for the Sake of our own Works, by the Merit of our own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. But how is either of the&s;e implied, in my waiting in the Way God has ordained, and ex|pecting that he will meet me there, becau&s;e he has promi&s;ed &s;o to do?</P>
<P>I do expect, that he will fulfil his Word, that he will meet and ble&s;s me in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Yet not for the Sake of any Works which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have done, nor for the Merit of my Righteou&s;ne&s;s: But mere|ly through the Merits and Sufferings and Love of his Son, in whom he is always well-plea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been vehemently objected. Thirdly, "that Chri&s;t is the only Means of Grace." I an|&s;wer, this is mere playing upon Words. Explain your Term, and the Objection vani&s;hes away.

Let us examine the Scriptures to which you refer. The fir&s;t of them, with the Context, runs thus:</P>
<P><Q>And when Pharoah drew nigh, the Children of I&s;rael lift up their Eyes&mdash;and they were &s;ore afraid. And they &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, Becau&s;e there were no Graves in Egypt, ha&s;t thou taken us away to die in the Wilderne&s;s? And Mo&s;es &s;aid unto the People, Fear ye not: Stand &s;till, and &s;ee the Salvation of the Lord. And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, &s;peak unto the Children of I&s;rael, that they go forward. But lift thou up thy Rod, and &s;tretch out thine Hand over the Sea and di|vide it. And the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall go on dry Ground through the Mid&s;t of the Sea, Exod. xiv, 10, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>Salvation</HI> of God, which they <HI>&s;tood &s;till</HI> to &s;ee, by <HI>marching forward</HI> with all their Might!</P>
<P>The other Pa&s;&s;age wherein this Expre&s;&s;ion oc|curs, &s;tands thus. <Q>There came &s;ome that told Je|ho&s;haphat, &s;aying, There cometh a great Multitude again&s;t thee, from beyond the Sea. And Jeho&s;ha|phat feared, and &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t throughout all Judah. And Ju|dah gathered them&s;elves together to a&s;k Help of the Lord, even out of all the Cities they came to &s;eek the Lord. And Jeho&s;haphat &s;tood in the Congregation, in the Hou&s;e of the Lord&mdash;Then upon Jahaziel came the Spirit of the Lord&mdash;And he &s;aid&mdash;Be not di&s;mayed by Rea&s;on of this great Multitude&mdash;To-morrow go ye down again&s;t them, ye &s;hall not need to fight in this Battle. Set your&s;elves: Stand ye &s;till, and &s;ee the Salva|tion of the Lord&mdash;And they ro&s;e early in the Morning and went forth. And when they began
<PB N="253" REF="028060_0238_0FD68C22D9061CD8">to &s;ing and to prai&s;e, the Lord &s;et Ambu&s;hments again&s;t the Children of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir&mdash;and every one helped to de&s;troy another, 2 Chron. xx. 2, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Salvation which the Children of <HI>Judah</HI> &s;aw. But how does all this prove, that we ought not to wait for the Grace of God, in the Means which he hath ordained?</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;hall mention but one Objection more, which indeed does not properly belong to this Head. Neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e it has been &s;o fre|quently urged, I may not wholly pa&s;s it by.</P>
<P>"Does not St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, <HI>If ye be dead with Chri&s;t, why are ye &s;ubject to Ordinances? Col.</HI> ii. 20. Therefore a Chri&s;tian, one that is <HI>dead with Chri&s;t,</HI> need not u&s;e the Ordinances any more."</P>
<P>So you &s;ay, "If I am a Chri&s;tian, I am not &s;ubject to the Ordinances of Chri&s;t!" Surely, by the Ab&s;urdity of this, you mu&s;t &s;ee at the fir&s;t Glance, that the Ordinances here mentioned can|not be the Ordinances of Chri&s;t! That they mu&s;t needs be the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ordinances, to which it is certain, a Chri&s;tian is no longer a Subject.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame undeniably appears from the Words immediately following, <HI>Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not</HI>&mdash;all evidently referring to the an|cient Ordinances of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law.</P>
<P>So that this Objection is the weake&s;t of all. And in Spight of all, that great Truth mu&s;t &s;tand un&s;haken, That all who de&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. But this being allowed, that all who de|&s;ire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Means he hath ordained: It may &s;till be enquired,
<PB N="254" REF="028060_0239_0FD68C23F7FE7900">how tho&s;e Means &s;hould be u&s;ed, both as to the <HI>Order,</HI> and the <HI>Manner</HI> of u&s;ing them;</P>
<P>With regard to the former, we may ob&s;erve, there is a Kind of Order, wherein God him&s;elf is generally plea&s;ed, to u&s;e the&s;e Means, in bring|ing a Sinner to Salvation. A &s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Wretch is going on in his own Way, not having God in all his Thoughts, when God comes up|on him unawares, perhaps by an awakening Ser|mon or Conver&s;ation, perhaps by &s;ome awful Providence; or it may be by an immediate Stroke of his convincing Spirit, without any outward Means at all. Having now a De&s;ire to flee from the Wrath to come, he purpo&s;ely goes to <HI>hear,</HI> how it may be done. If he find a Preacher who &s;peaks to the Heart, he is amazed, and begins <HI>&s;earching the Scriptures,</HI> whether the&s;e Things are &s;o? The more he <HI>hears</HI> and <HI>reads</HI> the more con|vinced he is; and the more he <HI>meditates</HI> thereon, Day and Night. Perhaps he finds &s;ome other Book, which explains and inforces what he has heard and read in Scripture. And by all the&s;e Means, the Arrows of Conviction &s;ink deeper into his Soul. He begins al&s;o to <HI>talk</HI> of the Things of God, which are ever uppermo&s;t in his Thoughts: Yea, and to talk with God, to <HI>pray</HI> to him, altho' through Fear and Shame, he &s;carce knows what to &s;ay. But whether he can &s;peak or no, he cannot but pray, were it only in <HI>Grouns which cannot be uttered.</HI> Yet being in doubt, whether <HI>the high and lofty One that inha|biteth Eternity</HI> will regard &s;uch a Sinner as him, he wants to pray with tho&s;e who know God, with the Faithful, in the <HI>Great Congregation.</HI> But here he ob&s;erves others go up to the <HI>Table of
<PB N="255" REF="028060_0240_0FD68C2610806D20">the Lord.</HI> He con&s;iders, Chri&s;t has &s;aid, "Do this!" How is it, that I do not! I am too great a Sinner. I am not fit. I am not worthy. After &s;truggling with the&s;e Scruples a while, he breaks through. And thus he continues in God's Way, in hearing, reading, meditating, praying, and par|taking of the Lord's Supper, till God, in the Man|ner that plea&s;es him, &s;peaks to his Heart, <HI>Thy Faith hath &s;aved thee! Go in Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By ob&s;erving this Order of God, we may learn what Means to recommend to any particular Soul. If any of the&s;e will reach a &s;tupid care|le&s;s Sinner, it is probably <HI>Hearing</HI> or <HI>Conver&s;ation.</HI> To &s;uch therefore we might recommend tho&s;e, if he has ever any Thought about Salvation. To one who begins to feel the Weight of his Sins, not only Hearing the Word of God, but <HI>Read|ing</HI> it too, and perhaps other <HI>&s;erious Books</HI> may be a Means of deeper Conviction. May you not advi&s;e him al&s;o, to <HI>meditate</HI> on what he reads, that it may have its full Force upon his Heart? Yea, and to <HI>&s;peak</HI> thereof and not be a&s;hamed, parti|cularly among tho&s;e who walk in the &s;ame Path. When Trouble and Heavine&s;s take hold upon him, &s;hould you not then earne&s;tly exhort him, to pour out his Soul before God! Always to <HI>pray and not to faint?</HI> And when he feels the Worth|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of his own Prayers, are you not to work together with God, and remind him of going up into <HI>the Hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> and praying with all them that fear him? But if he does this, the <HI>dy|ing Word</HI> of his Lord, will &s;oon be brought to his Remembrance: A plain Intimation, that this is the Time, when we &s;hould &s;econd the Motions of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit. And thus may we lead him
<PB N="256" REF="028060_0241_0FD68C27C1643F38">Step by Step, through all the Means which God has ordained; not according to our own Will, but ju&s;t as the Providence and the Spirit of God go before and open the Way.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet as we find no Command in Holy Writ, for any particular Order to be ob&s;erved herein, &s;o neither do the Providence and the Spirit of God, adhere to any without Variation: But the Means into which different Men are led, and in which they find the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, are varied, tran&s;po&s;ed and combined together, a thou&s;and dif|ferent Ways. Yet &s;till our Wi&s;dom is, to follow the Leadings of his Providence and his Spirit: To be guided herein (more e&s;pecially as to the Means wherein we our&s;elves &s;eek the Grace of God) partly by his outward Providence, giving us the Opportunity of u&s;ing &s;ometimes one Means, &s;ometimes another: Partly by our Experience, which it is whereby his free Spirit is plea&s;ed mo&s;t to work in our Heart. And in the mean time, the &s;ure and general Rule for all who groan for the Salvation of God, is this, Whenever Oppor|tunity &s;erves, u&s;e all the Means which God has ordained. For who knows, in which God will meet thee, with the Grace that bringeth Salva|tion?</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> of u&s;ing them, whereon indeed it wholly depends, whether they &s;hould convey any Grace at all to the U&s;er, it behoves us, Fir&s;t, always to retain a lively Sen&s;e, that God is above all Means. Have a Care therefore of limiting the Almighty. He doth what&s;oever and when&s;oever it plea&s;eth him. He can convey his Grace, either in or out of any of the Means which he hath appointed. Perhaps he will. <HI>Who
<PB N="257" REF="028060_0242_0FD68C28DF4EF808">hath known the Mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his Coun&s;ellor?</HI> Look then every Moment for his Appearing! Be it at the Hour you are employed in his Ordinances; or before, or after that Hour. Or when you are hindered therefrom. He is not hindered. He is always ready: Always able, always willing to &s;ave. <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Before</HI> you u&s;e any Means, let it be deeply impre&s;t on your Soul, "There is no <HI>Power</HI> in this. It is in it&s;elf a poor, dead, empty Thing: Separate from God; it is a dry Leaf, a Shadow. Neither is there any <HI>Merit</HI> in my u&s;ing this; nothing intrin&s;ically plea&s;ing to God, nothing whereby I de&s;erve any Favour at his hands, no, not a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue. But becau&s;e God bids, therefore I do; becau&s;e he directs me to wait in his Way, therefore here I wait for his free Mercy, whereof cometh my Sal|vation.</P>
<P>Settle this in your Heart, that the <HI>Opus Opera|tum,</HI> the mere Work done profiteth nothing: That there is no <HI>Power</HI> to &s;ave, but in the Spirit of God; no <HI>Merit,</HI> but in the Blood of Chri&s;t: That con&s;equently, even what God ordains, conveys no Grace to the Soul, if you tru&s;t not in him alone. On the other Hand, he that does truly tru&s;t in him, cannot fall &s;hort of the Grace of God, even tho' he were cut off from every Outward Ordinance, tho' he were &s;hut up in the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>In</HI> u&s;ing all Means, &s;eek God alone. In and through every Outward Thing, look &s;ingly to the <HI>Power</HI> of his Spirit, and the <HI>Merits</HI> of his Son. Beware you do not &s;tick in the
<PB N="258" REF="028060_0243_0FD68C2BDEBBFF08"><HI>Work</HI> it&s;elf; if you do, it is all lo&s;t Labour. No|thing &s;hort of God can &s;atisfy your Soul. There|fore eye him, in all, through all, and above all.</P>
<P>Remember al&s;o, to u&s;e all Means, <HI>as Means:</HI> As ordained, not for their own Sake, but in order to the Renewal of your Soul in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s. If therefore they actually tend to this, well. But if not, they are Dung and Dro&s;s. La&s;tly, <HI>After</HI> you have u&s;ed any of the&s;e, take care, how you value your&s;elf thereon: How you congratulate your&s;elf, as having done &s;ome great Thing. This is turning all into Poi&s;on. Think, "If God was not there, what does this avail? Have I not been adding Sin to Sin? How long! O Lord! &s;ave or I peri&s;h! O lay not this Sin to my Charge!" If God was there, if his Love flowed into your Heart, you have forgot, as it were, the Outward Work. You &s;ee, you know, you feel, God is All in All. Be aba&s;ed. Sink down before him. Give him all the Prai&s;e. Let God <HI>in all Things be glorified through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Let <HI>all</HI> your <HI>Bones cry out, My Song &s;hall be always of the Loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord: With my Mouth will I ever be telling of thy Truth, from one Genera|tion to another!</HI></P>

I. 1. I am, fir&s;t, to enquire, wherein that Cir|cumci&s;ion of Heart con&s;i&s;ts, which will receive the Prai&s;e of God. In general we may ob&s;erve, it is that habitual Di&s;po&s;ition of Soul, which in the Sacred Writings is termed Holine&s;s, and which di|rectly implies, the being clean&s;ed from Sin <Q>from all Filthine&s;s both of Fle&s;h and Spirit,</Q> and by Con&s;equence, the being endued with tho&s;e Virtues, which were al&s;o in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> the being &s;o <HI>re|newed in the Image of our Mind,</HI> as to be <HI>perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To be more particular, Circumci&s;ion of Heart implies, Humility, Faith, Hope, and Cha|rity. Humility, a right Judgment of our&s;elves, clean&s;es our Minds from tho&s;e high Conceits of our own Perfections, from that undue Opi|nion of our own Abilities and Attainments, which are the genuine Fruit of a corrupted Na|ture.

II. 1. Thus have I particularly inquired, what that <HI>Circumci&s;ion of Heart</HI> is, which will obtain the Prai&s;e or God. I am, in the &s;econd Place, to mention &s;ome Reflections, that naturally ari&s;e from &s;uch an Inquiry, as a plain Rule whereby eve|ry Man may judge of him&s;elf, whether he be of the World or of God.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, it is clear, from what has been &s;aid, That no Man has a Title to the Prai&s;e of God, unle&s;s his Heart is circumci&s;ed by Humility, unle&s;s he is little, and ba&s;e, and vile in his own Eyes: unle&s;s he is deeply convinced of that inbred "Cor|ruption of his Nature, whereby he is very far gone from Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s," being prone to all Evil, aver&s;e to all Good, corrupt and abomina|ble; having a <HI>carnal Mind.</HI> which <HI>is Enmity a|gain&s;t GOD, and is not &s;ubject to the Law of GOD; nor indeed can be:</HI> Unle&s;s he continually feels in his in mo&s;t Soul, that without the Spirit of God re&s;ting upon him, he can neither think, nor de&s;ire, nor &s;peak, nor act, any Thing good or well-plea&s;ing in his Sight.</P>
<P>No Man, I &s;ay, has a Title to the Prai&s;e of God, 'till he feels his Want of God: Nor in|deed, 'till he &s;eeketh that <HI>Honour, which cometh of GOD only:</HI> And neither de&s;ires nor pur&s;ues that which cometh of Man, unle&s;s &s;o far, only as it tends to this.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Truth which naturally follows from what has been &s;aid, is, that none &s;hall ob|tain the Honour that cometh of God, unle&s;s his Heart be circumci&s;ed by Faith; even a <HI>Faith of the Operation of GOD:</HI> unle&s;s refu&s;ing to be any longer led by his Sen&s;es, Appetites or Pa&s;|&s;ions, or even by that blind Leader of the Blind,
<PB N="268" REF="028060_0256_0FD68C4B5F8F6820">&s;o idolized by the World, natural Rea&s;on, he lives and <HI>walks by Faith,</HI> directs every Step, as <HI>&s;eeing Him that is invi&s;ible, looks not at the Things that are &s;een, which are temporal, but at the Things that are not &s;een which are eternal;</HI> and governs all his De|&s;ires, De&s;igns and Thoughts, all his Actions and Conver&s;ations, as one who is entered in within the Veil, where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;its at the Right-hand of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. It were to be wi&s;hed, that they were better acquainted with this Faith, who employ much of their Time and Pains, in laying another Founda|tion; in grounding Religion, on "the Eternal <HI>Fit|ne&s;s</HI> of Things," on "the intrin&s;ick <HI>Excellence</HI> of Virtue," and the <HI>Beauty</HI> of Actions flowing from it: On the <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> as they term them, of Good and Evil, and the <HI>Relations</HI> of Beings to each other. Either the&s;e Accounts of the Grounds of Chri&s;tian Duty, coincide with the Scriptural, or not. If they do, why are well-meaning Men perplext, and drawn from the weightier Matters of the Law, by a Cloud of Terms, whereby the ea&s;ie&s;t Truths are explained into Ob&s;curity. If they are not, then it behoves them to con&s;ider, who is the Author of this New Doctrine: Whether he is likely to be <HI>an Angel from Heaven,</HI> who <HI>preacheth another Go&s;pel</HI> than that of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> Though, if he were, God, not we, hath pronounced his Sentence, <HI>Let him be accur&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Our Go&s;pel, as it knows no other Founda|tion of Good Works than Faith, or of Faith than <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o it clearly informs us, we are not his Di&s;|ciples, while we either deny Him to be the Author, or his Spirit to be the In&s;pirer and Perfecter both of our Faith and Works. <HI>If any Man have not the Spirit of</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>he is none of his.</HI> He alone can
<PB N="269" REF="028060_0257_0FD68C4D30AB2EC8">quicken tho&s;e who are dead unto God, can breathe into them the Breath of Chri&s;tian Life, and &s;o pre|vent, accompany, and follow them with his Grace, as to bring their good De&s;ires to good Effect. And <HI>as many as are thus led, by the Spirit of</HI> God, <HI>they are the Sons of</HI> God. This is God's &s;hort and plain Account of true Religion and Virtue; and <HI>other Foundation can no Man lay.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. From what has been &s;aid we may, Thirdly, learn, That none is truly <HI>led by the Spirit,</HI> unle&s;s that <HI>Spirit bear Witne&s;s with his Spirit, that he is a Child of</HI> God: unle&s;s he &s;ee the Prize and the Crown before him, and <HI>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</HI> God: So greatly have they erred, who have taught that in &s;erving God, we ought not to have a View to our own Happine&s;s. Nay, but we are often and expre&s;sly taught of God, to have Re&s;pect <HI>unto the Recompence of Reward;</HI> to balance the Toil with the <HI>Joy &s;et before us,</HI> the&s;e <HI>light Afflictions</HI> with that <HI>exceeding Weight of Glory.</HI> Yea, we are <HI>Aliens to the Covenant of Promi&s;e,</HI> we are <HI>without</HI> God <HI>in the World,</HI> until God <HI>of his abundant Mercy, hath be|gotten us again, unto a living Hope, of the Inheri|tance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But if the&s;e Things are &s;o, 'tis high Time for tho&s;e Per&s;ons to deal faithfully with their own Souls, who are &s;o far from finding in them&s;elves this joyful A&s;&s;urance, that they fulfil the Terms and &s;hall obtain the Promi&s;es of that Covenant, as to quarrel with the Covenant it&s;elf, and bla&s;pheme the Terms of it: To complain, "They are too &s;evere, and that no Man ever did, or &s;hall live up to them!"

<P N="2">2. But it is not a barely notional or &s;pecula|tive Faith, that is here &s;poken of by the A|po&s;tles. It is not a bare A&s;&s;ent to this Propo|&s;ition, "<HI>Je&s;us</HI> is the <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI>" nor indeed to all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Propo&s;itions contained in our Creed, or in the Old and New Te&s;tament. It is not merely "an A&s;&s;ent, to any, or all the&s;e credible Things as credible." To &s;ay this, were to &s;ay, (which who could hear?) that the Devils were born of God. For they have this Faith. They trem|bling believe, both that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is the <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that all Scripture having been given by In&s;pi|ration of God, is true as God is true. It is not only "an A&s;&s;ent to Divine Truth, upon the Te&s;ti|mony of God," or "upon the Evidence of Miracles." For they al&s;o heard the Words of his Mouth, and knew Him to be a faithful and true Witne&s;s. They could not but receive the Te&s;timony He gave, both of Him&s;elf, and of the Father which &s;ent Him.

<P N="3">3. For all this is no more than a dead Faith. The True, Living, Chri&s;tian Faith, which who|&s;oever hath is <HI>born of</HI> God, is not only an A&s;|&s;ent, an Act of the Under&s;tanding, but a Di&s;po|&s;ition which God hath wrought in his Heart; "a &s;ure Tru&s;t and Confidence in God, that through the Merits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> his Sins are for|given, and he reconciled to the Favour of God." This implies, that a Man fir&s;t <HI>renounces him&s;elf;</HI> that in order to be <HI>found in</HI> Chri&s;t, to be accept|ed through Him, he totally rejects all <HI>Confidence in the Fle&s;h;</HI> that <HI>having nothing to pay,</HI> having no Tru&s;t in his own Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s of any Kind, he comes to God, as a lo&s;t, mi&s;erable, &s;elf-de&s;troyed, &s;elf-condemned, undone, helple&s;s Sinner; as one who&s;e <HI>Mouth</HI> is utterly <HI>&s;topped,</HI> and who is altogether <HI>guilty before</HI> God. Such a Sen&s;e of Sin (commonly called <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> by tho&s;e who &s;peak Evil of the Things they know not together with a full Conviction, &s;uch as no Words can expre&s;s, That of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> only cometh our Sal|vation, and an earne&s;t De&s;ire of that Salvation, mu&s;t precede a Living Faith: A Tru&s;t in Him, who "for us paid our Ran&s;om by his Death, and for us fulfilled the Law in his Life."

<P N="3">3. The nece&s;&s;ary Fruit of this Love of God, is the Love of our Neighbour, of every Soul which God hath made; not excepting our enemies, not excepting tho&s;e who are now <HI>de&s;pitefully u&s;ing and per&s;ecuting us:</HI> A Love, whereby we love every Man <HI>as our&s;elves,</HI> as we love our own Souls. Nay, our Lord has expre&s;&s;ed it &s;till more &s;trongly, teaching us to <HI>love one another even as he hath loved us.</HI> Accordingly the Commandment written in the Hearts of all tho&s;e that love God, is no other than this, <HI>As I have loved you, &s;o love ye one another.</HI> Now<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>herein perceive we the Love of</HI> God, <HI>in that He laid down his Life for us.

Then<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14.</NOTE> <HI>we know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, be|cau&s;e we</HI> thus <HI>love our Brethren.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ch. iv. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Hereby know we</HI> that we are born of God, that we <HI>dwell in Him, and He in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his loving Spirit.</HI> For<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">John iv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Love is of</HI> God, <HI>and every one that</HI> thus <HI>loveth, is born of</HI> God <HI>and knoweth</HI> God.</P>
<P N="4">4. But &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k, Does not the Apo&s;tle &s;ay,<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 3.</NOTE> <HI>This is the Love of</HI> God, <HI>that we keep his Commandments?</HI> Yea, and this the Love of our Neighbour al&s;o, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as it is the Love of God. But what would you infer from hence? That the keeping the outward Commandments, is all that is implied in loving God with all your
<PB N="287" REF="028060_0274_0FD68C7C1D4B5BF0">Heart, with all your Mind, and Soul, and Strength, and in loving your Neighbour as your&s;elf? That the Love of God is not an Affection of the Soul, but merely an <HI>Outward Service?</HI> And that the Love of our Neighbour is not a Di&s;po&s;ition of Heart, but barely a Cour&s;e of <HI>Outward Works!</HI> To mention &s;o wild an Interpretation of the Apo&s;tle's Words, is &s;ufficiently to confute it. The plain indi&s;putable Meaning of that Text is, <HI>this is the</HI> Sign or Proof of the <HI>Love of</HI> God, of our keeping the fir&s;t and great Commandment, to keep all the re&s;t of his Commandments. For true Love, if it be once &s;hed abroad in our Heart, will con&s;train us &s;o to do: Since who&s;oever loves God with all his Heart, cannot but &s;erve Him with all his Strength.</P>
<P N="5">5. A &s;econd Fruit then of the Love of God, (&s;o far as it can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it) is univer&s;al Obedience to Him we love, and Conformity to his Will: Obedience to all the Commands of God, internal and external: Obedience of the Heart and of the Life, in every Temper, and in all Manner of Conver&s;ation. And one of the Tempers mo&s;t obviou&s;ly implied herein is, the being <HI>zealous of good Works;</HI> the hungering and thir&s;ting to do Good, in every po&s;&s;ible Kind, unto all Men; The rejoic|ing to <HI>&s;pend and be &s;pent for them,</HI> for every Child of Man, not looking for any Recompen&s;e in this World, but only in the Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus have I plainly laid down tho&s;e Marks of the New-birth, which I find laid down in Scrip|ture. Thus doth God Him&s;elf an&s;wer that weighty Que&s;tion, what it is to be born of God? Such, if the Appeal be made to the Oracles of God, is <HI>every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> This it is, in the
<PB N="288" REF="028060_0275_0FD68C7F1E692800">Judgment of the Spirit of God, to be a Son or a Child of God. It is, &s;o to believe in God thro' <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>not to commit Sin,</HI> and to enjoy at all Times and in all Places, that <HI>Peace of</HI> God <HI>which pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding.</HI> It is, &s;o to <HI>hope</HI> in God through the Son of his Love, as to have not only the <HI>Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience,</HI> but al&s;o the Spirit of God <HI>bearing Witne&s;s with your Spirits, that ye are the Children of</HI> God: Whence cannot but &s;pring the <HI>rejoicing evermore in Him through whom ye have received the Atonement.</HI> It is &s;o to <HI>love</HI> God who hath thus loved you, as you never did love any Creature: So that ye are con&s;trained to love all Men as your&s;elves; with a Love not only ever burning in your Hearts, but flaming out in all your Actions and Conver&s;ations, and making your whole Life one <HI>Labour of Love,</HI> one continued O|bedience to tho&s;e Commands, <HI>Be ye merciful, as</HI> God <HI>is merciful; Be ye holy, as I the</HI> Lord <HI>am holy; Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Who then are ye that are thus born of God? Ye <HI>know the Things which are given to you of</HI> God. Ye well know, that ye are the Children of God; and <HI>can a&s;&s;ure your Hearts before Him.</HI> And every one of you who has ob&s;erved the&s;e Words cannot but feel and know of a Truth, whether at this Hour, (an&s;wer to God and not to Man!) you are thus a Child of God or no? The Que&s;tion is not what you was made in Bapti&s;m: (Do not evade:) But, what you are now? Is the Spirit of Adoption now in your Heart? To your own Heart let the Appeal be made. I a&s;k not, whether you <HI>was</HI> born of Water and of the Spirit. But <HI>are</HI> you <HI>now</HI> the Temple of the Holy Gho&s;t which dwelleth in you? I

But does the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and of Glory <HI>now</HI> re&s;t upon you? El&s;e <HI>your Circumci&s;ion is become Uncir|cumci&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Say not then in your Heart, I <HI>was once</HI> bap|tized. Therefore I <HI>am now</HI> a Child of God? Alas, that Con&s;equence will by no Means hold. How many are the baptized Gluttons and Drunkards, the baptized Liars and common Swearers, the bap|tized Railers and Evil-&s;peakers, the baptized Whore-mongers, Thieves, Extortioners? What think you? Are the&s;e now the Children of God? Verily I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever you are, unto whom any one of the preceding Characters be|long, <HI>ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Works of your Father ye do.</HI> Unto you I call, in the Name of Him whom you crucify afre&s;h, and in his Words to your circumci&s;ed Predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, How can you e&s;cape the Damna|tion of Hell?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. How indeed, except ye be born again! For ye are now dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins. To &s;ay then, that ye cannot be born again, That there is no New-birth but in Bapti&s;m, is to &s;eal you all under Damnation, to con&s;ign you to Hell, without Help, without Hope. And perhaps &s;ome may think this ju&s;t and right. In their Zeal for the Lord of Ho&s;ts, they may &s;ay, "Yea, cut off the Sinners, the <HI>Amelekites!</HI> Let the&s;e <HI>Gibeonites</HI> be utterly de|&s;troyed! They de&s;erve no le&s;s."&mdash;No; nor I: nor you.&mdash;Mine and your De&s;ert, as well as theirs, is Hell. And it is more Mercy, free unde&s;erved Mer|cy, that <HI>we</HI> are not now in unquenchable Fire. You will &s;ay, "But we are wa&s;hed, we were born
<PB N="290" REF="028060_0277_0FD62876F2CC1AC8">again of Water and of the Spirit." So <HI>were</HI> they. This therefore hinders not at all, but that ye may <HI>now</HI> be even as they. Know ye not, that <HI>what is highly e&s;teemed of Men is an Abomination in the Sight of</HI> God? Come forth, ye "Saints of the World." ye that are honoured of Men, and &s;ee who will ca&s;t the fir&s;t Stone at them, at the&s;e Wretches, not fit to live upon the Earth, the&s;e common Harlots, Adultevers, Murderers.

Lean no more on the Staff of that broken Reed, that ye <HI>were</HI> born again in Bapti&s;m. Ye are now Children of the De|vil. Therefore ye mu&s;t be born again. And let not <HI>Satan</HI> put it into your Heart, to cavil at a Word, when the Thing is clear. Ye have heard, what are the Marks of the Children of God: All ye who have them not on your Souls, baptized or unbaptized, mu&s;t needs receive them, or without Doubt ye will peri&s;h everla&s;tingly. And if ye have been baptized, your only Hope is this, That tho&s;e who were &s;ederally made the Chil|dren of God by Bapti&s;m, but are now the Children of the Devil, may yet receive <HI>Power, to become the Sons of</HI> God: That they may receive even the <HI>Spi|rit of Adoption, crying in their Hearts, Abba, Fa|ther!</HI></P>

<PB N="5" REF="028060_0281_0FD68C8B1571CAB8">
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 JOHN iii. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit Sin.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT has been frequently &s;uppo&s;ed, that the being born of God was all one with the being ju&s;tified; that the new birth and ju&s;tifica|tion were only different expre&s;&s;ions, denoting the &s;ame thing: It being certain on the one hand, that whoever is ju&s;tified, is al&s;o born of God; and on the other, that whoever is born of God, is al|&s;o ju&s;tified: Yea, that both the&s;e gifts of God are given to every believer in one and the &s;ame mo|ment. In one point of time his &s;ins are blotted out, and he is born again of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. But though it be al&s;o wed, that ju&s;tification and the new birth are in point of time in&s;eparable from each other, yet are they ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being not the &s;ame, but things of a widely dif|ferent nature. Ju&s;tification implies only a relative, the new birth a real change. God in ju&s;tifying us, does &s;omething <HI>for</HI> us: In begetting us again, he does the work <HI>in</HI> us. The former changes our outward relation to God, &s;o that of enemies we become children. By the latter our inmo&s;t &s;ouls are changed, &s;o that of &s;inners we become &s;aints.
<PB N="6" REF="028060_0282_0FD68C8D05FE35D0">The one re&s;tores us to the favour, the other to the image of God. The one is, the taking away the guilt, the other, the taking away the power of &s;in. So that although they are joined together in point of time, yet are they of wholly di&s;tinct natures.</P>
<P N="3">3. The not di&s;cerning this, the not ob&s;erving the wide difference there is, between being ju&s;ti|fied and being born again, has occa&s;ioned exceed|ing great confu&s;ion of thought, in many who have treated on this &s;ubject: particularly when they have attempted to explain this great privilege of the children of God; to &s;hew how <HI>who&s;oever is born of</HI> God, <HI>doth not commit &s;in.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In order to apprehend this clearly, it may be nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to con&s;ider what is the proper meaning of that expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Who&s;oever is born of</HI> God; and, &s;econdly, to enquire, in what &s;en&s;e he <HI>doth not commit &s;in.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. Fir&s;t, we are to con&s;ider, what is the proper meaning of that expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Who&s;oever is born of</HI> God. And in general, from all the pa&s;|&s;ages of holy writ, wherein this expre&s;&s;ion, the being <HI>born of</HI> God, occurs, we may learn that it implies not barely the being baptized, or any outward change whatever; but a va&s;t inward change, a change wrought in the &s;oul, by the operation of the Holy Gho&s;t: a change in the whole manner of our exi&s;tence; for from the moment we are <HI>born of</HI> God, we live in quite ano|ther manner than we did before; we are, as it were, in another world.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ground and rea&s;on of the expre&s;&s;ion, his ea&s;y to be under&s;tood. When we under go this
<PB N="7" REF="028060_0283_0FD68C8F1A221428">great change, we may with much propriety be &s;aid <HI>to be born again,</HI> becau&s;e there is &s;o near a re|&s;emblance between the circum&s;tances of the na|tural and of the &s;piritual birth: &s;o that to con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the natural birth, is the mo&s;t ea&s;y way to under&s;tand the &s;piritual.</P>
<P N="3">3. The child which is not yet born, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in|deed by the air, as does every thing which has life; but <HI>feels</HI> it not, nor any thing el&s;e, unle&s;s in a very dull and imperfect manner. It <HI>hears</HI> lit|tle, if at all, the organs of hearing being as yet clo&s;ed up. It <HI>&s;ees</HI> nothing, having its eyes fa&s;t &s;hut, and being &s;urrounded with utter darkne&s;s, There are, it may be, &s;ome &s;aint beginnings of life, when the time of its birth draws nigh; and &s;ome motion con&s;equent thereon, whereby it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from a mere ma&s;s of matter. But it has no <HI>&s;en&s;es;</HI> all the&s;e avenues of the &s;oul are hitherto quite &s;hut up. Of con&s;equence, it has &s;carce any intercour&s;e with this vi&s;ible world: nor any knowledge, conception, or idea, of the things that occur therein.</P>
<P N="4">4. The rea&s;on why he that is not yet born, is wholly a &s;tranger to the vi&s;ible world, is, not be|cau&s;e it is afar off. It is very nigh. It &s;urrounde him on every &s;ide. But partly, becau&s;e he has not tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, they are not yet opened in his &s;oul, whereby alone it is po&s;&s;ible to hold com|merce with the material world; and partly be|cau&s;e &s;o thick a veil is ca&s;t between, thro' which he can di&s;cern nothing.</P>
<P N="5">5. But no &s;ooner is the child born into the world, than he exi&s;ts in a quite different man|ner. He now <HI>feels</HI> the air with which he is &s;urrounded, and which pours into him from
<PB N="8" REF="028060_0284_0FD68C917A3BD640">every &s;ide, as fa&s;t as he alternately breathes it back, to &s;u&s;tain the flame of life. And hence &s;prings a continual increa&s;e of &s;trength, of mo|tion and of &s;en&s;ation: all the bodily &s;en&s;es being now awakened, and furni&s;hed with their proper objects.</P>
<P>His eyes are now opened to perceive the light, which &s;ilently flowing in upon them, di&s;|covers not only it&s;elf, but an in&s;inite variety of things, with which before he was wholly unacquainted. His ears are unclo&s;ed, and &s;ounds ru&s;h in, with endle&s;s diver&s;ity. Every, &s;en&s;e is employed upon &s;uch objects as are peculiarly &s;uitable to it. And by the&s;e inlets, the &s;oul having an open intercour&s;e with the vi&s;ible world, acquires more and more knowledge of &s;en&s;ible things, of all the things which are under the &s;un.</P>
<P N="6">6. So it is with him that is born of God. Before that great change is wrought, although he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by him, in whom all that have life <HI>live and move and have their being,</HI> yet he is not <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of God; he does not <HI>feel,</HI> he has no in|ward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his pre&s;ence. He does not perceive that divine breath of life, with|out which he cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment. Nor is he &s;en&s;ible of any of the things of God. They make no impre&s;&s;ion upon his &s;oul. God is con|tinually calling to him from on high, but he heareth not; his ears are &s;hut; &s;o that <HI>the voice of the charmer</HI> is lo&s;t to him, <HI>charm he n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r &s;o wi&s;ely.</HI> He &s;eeth not the things of the &s;pirit of God, the eyes of his under&s;tanding being clo&s;ed, and utter darkne&s;s covering his whole &s;oul, &s;urrounding him on every &s;ide. It is true, he
<PB N="9" REF="028060_0285_0FD68C95A24C0780">may have &s;ome &s;aint dawnings of life, &s;ome &s;mall beginnings of &s;piritual motion; but as yet he has no &s;piritual &s;en&s;es, capable of di&s;cerning &s;piritual objects. Con&s;equently he <HI>di&s;cerneth not the things of the &s;pirit of</HI> God. <HI>He cannot know them; be|cau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Hence he has &s;carce any knowledge of the invi&s;ible world, as he has &s;carce any inter|cour&s;e with it. Not that it is afar off. No: he is in the mid&s;t of it: it encompa&s;&s;es him round about. The <HI>other world,</HI> as we u&s;ually term it, is not far from every one of us. It is above, and beneath, and on every &s;ide. On|ly the natural man di&s;cerneth it not; partly, be|cau&s;e he has no &s;piritual &s;en&s;es, whereby alone we can di&s;cern the things of God; partly, becau&s;e &s;o thick a veil is interpo&s;ed, as he knows not how to penetrate.</P>

<P>It is plain in fact, that tho&s;e whom we cannot deny to have been truly <HI>born of</HI> God (the &s;pirit of God having given us in his word, this infalli|ble te&s;timony concerning them) neverthele&s;s not only could, but did commit &s;in, even gro&s;s, out|ward &s;in.

<PB N="14" REF="028060_0290_0FD68CA267AE5EF8">the face, becau&s;e he was to be blamed.

<P N="7">7. I an&s;wer, what has been long ob&s;erved is this: &s;o long as <HI>he that is born of God keepeth him&s;elf</HI> (which he is able to do, by the grace of God) <HI>the wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> But if he keepeth not him&s;elf, if he abide not in the faith, he may com|mit &s;in even as another man.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y therefore to under&s;tand, how any of the&s;e children of God might be moved from his own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s, and yet the great truth of God, declared by the apo&s;tle, remain &s;tedfa&s;t and un&s;haken. He did not <HI>keep him&s;elf</HI> by that grace of God which was &s;ufficient for him.

<P N="8">8. To explain this by a particular in&s;tance: <HI>Da|vid</HI> was born of God, and &s;aw God by faith. He loved God in &s;incerity. He could truly &s;ay, <HI>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth</HI> (neither per&s;on, nor thing) <HI>that I de&s;ire in compari&s;on of thee!</HI> but &s;till there remained in his heart that corruption of nature, which is the &s;eed of all evil.</P>
<P>He was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xi. 2.</NOTE> <HI>walking upon the roof of his hou&s;e,</HI> pro|bably prai&s;ing the God whom his &s;oul loved, when he looked down and &s;aw <HI>Bath&s;heba.</HI> He felt a temptation, a thought which tended to evil. The &s;pirit of God did not fail to convince him of this. He doubtle&s;s heard and knew the warning voice. But he yielded in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the thought, and the temptation began to prevail over him. Hereby his &s;pirit was &s;ullied; he &s;aw God &s;till; but it was more dimly than before. He loved God &s;till; but not in the &s;ame degree, not with the &s;ame &s;trength and ardor of affection. Yet God checked him again, though his &s;pirit was grieved; and his voice, though fainter and fainter, &s;till whi&s;pered, "Sin lieth at the door; look unto me, and be thou &s;aved." But he would not hear. He looked again, not unto God, but unto the forbidden object, till nature was &s;upe|rior to grace, and kindled lu&s;t in his &s;oul.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="10">10. To explain this by another in&s;tance. The apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> was full of faith and of the Holy Gho&s;t; and hereby keeping him&s;elf, he had a con|&s;cience void of offence toward God and toward man.</P>
<P>Walking thus in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, <HI>before that certain came from</HI> James, <HI>he did eat with the gentiles,</HI> knowing that what God had clean&s;ed, was not common or unclean.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028060_0293_0FD68CA79A66E170">
But <HI>when they were come,</HI> a temptation aro&s;e in his heart, <HI>to fear tho&s;e of the circumci&s;ion</HI> (the Jew|i&s;h converts, who were zealous for circumci&s;ron and the other rites of the Mo&s;aic law) and regard the favour and prai&s;e of the&s;e men, more than the prai&s;e of God.</P>
<P>He was warned by the &s;pirit that &s;in was near. Neverthele&s;s he yielded to it in &s;ome degree, even to &s;inful fear of man, and his faith and love were proportionably weakened.</P>
<P>God reproved him again for giving place to the devil. Yet he would not hearken to the voice of his &s;hepherd; but gave him&s;elf up to that flavi&s;h fear, and thereby quenched the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Then God di&s;appeared, and faith and love be|ing extinct, he committed the outward &s;in. <HI>Walk|ing not uprightly,</HI> not <HI>according to the truth of the go&s;pel,</HI> he <HI>&s;eparated him&s;elf</HI> from his chri&s;tian bre|thren, and by his evil example, if not advice al&s;o, <HI>compelled</HI> even <HI>the</HI> Gentiles <HI>to live after the manner of the</HI> Jews; to entangle them&s;elves again with that <HI>yoke of bondage,</HI> from which <HI>Chri&s;t had &s;et them free.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is unque&s;tionably true, that he who is born of God, keeping him&s;elf, doth not, cannot commit &s;in; and yet, if he keepeth not him&s;elf, he may commit all manner of &s;in with greedine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. From the preceding con&s;iderations we may learn, fir&s;t, To give a clear and unconte&s;tible an&s;wer, to a que&s;tion which has frequently per|plexed many, who were &s;incere of heart. Does &s;in precede or follow the lo&s;s of faith? "Does a child of God fir&s;t commit &s;in, and thereby lo&s;e his faith? Or does he lo&s;e his faith fir&s;t, before he can commit &s;in?"</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028060_0294_0FD68CABC6EA7648">
I an&s;wer, &s;ome &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily precede the lo&s;s of faith: &s;ome inward &s;in. But the lo&s;s of &s;aith mu&s;t precede the com|mitting outward &s;in.</P>
<P>The more any believer examines his own heart, the more will he be convinced of this: That <HI>faith working by love,</HI> excludes both inward and out|ward &s;in from a &s;oul <HI>watching unto prayer:</HI> that neverthele&s;s we are even then liable to tempta|tion, particularly to the &s;in that did ea&s;ily be&s;et us: that if the loving eye of the &s;oul be &s;teadily fixed on God, the temptation &s;oon vani&s;hes away: but if not, if we are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 14.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, (as the apo&s;tle James &s;peaks) <HI>drawn out</HI> of God by our <HI>own de|&s;ire,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>caught by the bait</HI> of pre&s;ent or promi&s;ed plea&s;ure: then that <HI>de&s;ire conceived</HI> in us, <HI>brings forth &s;in;</HI> and having by that inward &s;in de&s;troyed our faith, it ca&s;ts us headlong into the &s;nare of the devil, &s;o that we may commit any outward &s;in whatever.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been &s;aid, we may learn, &s;econdly, what the life of God in the &s;oul of a believer is; wherein it properly con&s;i&s;ts; and what is immediately and nece&s;&s;arily implied therein. It immediately and nece&s;&s;arily implies, the continual in&s;piration of God's Holy Spirit: God's breath|ing into the &s;oul, and the &s;oul's breathing back what it fir&s;t receives from God: a continual ac|tion of God upon the &s;oul, and re-action of the &s;oul upon God: an uncea&s;ing pre&s;ence of God, the loving, pardoning God, manife&s;ted to the heart, and perceived by faith; and an uncea&s;ing return of love, prai&s;e, and prayer, offering up all the thoughts of our hearts, all the words of our
<PB N="19" REF="028060_0295_0FD68CAED55F9E60">tongues, all the works of our hands, all our bo|dy, &s;oul, and &s;pirit, to be an holy &s;acrifice, ac|ceptable unto God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="3">3. And hence we may, thirdly, infer, the ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this re-action of the &s;oul (what&s;oever it be called) in order to the continu|ance of the divine life therein. For it plainly appears, God does not continue to act upon the &s;oul, unle&s;s the &s;oul re-acts upon God. He pre|vents us indeed with the ble&s;&s;ings of his good|ne&s;s. He fir&s;t loves us, and manife&s;ts him&s;elf unto us. While we are yet afar off, he calls us to him&s;elf, and &s;hines upon our hearts. But if we do not then love him who fir&s;t loved us, if we will not hearken to his voice; if we turn our eye away from him, and will not attend to the light which he pours upon us, his &s;pirit will not always &s;trive; he will gradually withdraw, and leave us to the darkne&s;s of our own hearts. He will not continue to breathe into our &s;oul, unle&s;s our &s;oul breathes toward him again; unle&s;s our love, and prayer, and thank&s;giving return to him, a &s;acrifice wherewith he is well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us learn, la&s;tly, to follow that directi|on of the great apo&s;tle, <HI>Be not high minded, but fear.</HI> Let us fear &s;in more than death or hell. Let us have a jealous (tho' not painful) fear, le&s;t we &s;hould lean to our own deceitful hearts. <HI>Let him that &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> Even he who now &s;tandeth fa&s;t in the grace of God, in the <HI>faith</HI> that <HI>overcometh the world,</HI> may neverthele&s;s fall into inward &s;in, and thereby <HI>make &s;hipwreck of his faith.</HI> And how ea&s;ily then will outward &s;in regain its dominion over him?

<P N="3">3. And what is it which he is teaching? The Son of God, who came from heaven, is here &s;hewing us the way to heaven, to the place which he hath prepared for us, the glory he had before the world began. He is teaching us the true way to life everla&s;ting, the royal way which leads to the kingdom. And the only true way; for there is none be&s;ides: all other paths lead to de&s;truction. From the character of the &s;peaker we are well a&s;&s;ured, that he hath declared the full and perfect will of God. He hath utter|ed not one tittle too much; nothing more than he had received of the Father. Nor too little; he hath not &s;hunned to declare the whole coun|&s;el of God. Much le&s;s hath he uttered any thing wrong, any thing contrary to the will of him that &s;ent him. All his words are true, and right, concerning all things, and &s;hall &s;tand fa&s;t for ever and ever.</P>
<P>And we may ea&s;ily remark, that in explaining and confirming the&s;e faithful and true &s;ayings, he takes care to refute not only the mi&s;takes of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees which then were, the fal&s;e comments whereby the Jewi&s;h teachers of that age had perverted the word of God; but all the practical mi&s;takes, that are incon&s;i&s;tent

<P N="4">4. And hence we are naturally led to ob&s;erve, whom it is that he is here teaching? Not the apo&s;tles alone; if &s;o, he had no need to have gone <HI>up into the mountain.</HI> A room in the hou&s;e of Matthew, or any of his di&s;ciples, would have contained the twelve. Nor does it in any wi&s;e appear, that the <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> who <HI>came unto him,</HI> were the twelve only.

<P>Nor was it only tho&s;e multitudes who were with him on the mount, to whom he now taught the way of &s;alvation; but all the children of men, the whole race of mankind, the children that were yet unborn; all the generations to come even to the end of the world, who &s;hould ever hear the words of this life.</P>

5. And this all men allow, with regard to &s;ome parts of the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e. No man, for in|&s;tance, denies, that what is &s;aid of <HI>poverty of &s;pirit,</HI> relates to all mankind.

<P>But may we not ju&s;tly enquire, who told them this? that &s;ome parts of this di&s;cour&s;e, concern|ed only the apo&s;tles? or the chri&s;tians of the apo&s;tolic age? or the mini&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> bare a&s;&s;ertions are not a &s;ufficient proof, to e&s;tabli&s;h a point of &s;o great importance. Has then our Lord him&s;elf taught us, that &s;ome parts of his di&s;cour&s;e, do not concern all mankind? without doubt, had it been &s;o, he would have told us; he could not have omitted &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an informa|tion.

Has any of the apo&s;tles, or other in&s;pired writers, left &s;uch an in&s;truction upon record? no &s;uch thing. No a&s;&s;ertion of this kind is to be found in all the oracles of God. Who then are the men who are &s;o much wi&s;er than God? wi&s;e, &s;o far above that is written?</P>
<P N="6">6. Perhaps they will &s;ay, "That the rea&s;on of the thing requires &s;uch a re&s;triction to be made." If it does, it mu&s;t be on one of the&s;e

It will plainly appear, when we come to examine the &s;everal particulars, that there is no ab&s;urdity at all in applying all which our Lord hath here delivered, to all man|kind. Neither will it infer any contradiction to any thing el&s;e he has delivered, nor to any other &s;cripture whatever. Nay, it will farther appear, that either all the parts of this di&s;cour&s;e are to be applied to men in general; or no part; &s;ee|ing they are all connected together, all joined as the &s;tones in an arch, of which you cannot take one away, without de&s;troying the whole fabric.</P>
<P N="7">7. We may, la&s;tly, ob&s;erve, how our Lord teaches here.

No, nor even as him&s;elf, at any other time, or on any other occa&s;ion. It does not appear, that it was ever his de&s;ign, at any other time or place, to lay down at once the whole plan of his reli|gion, to give us a full pro&s;pect of chri&s;tianity, to de&s;cribe at large the nature of that holine&s;s without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.

<P>It may not improbably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that our Lord, looking on tho&s;e who were round about him, and ob&s;erving that not many rich were there, but rather the poor of the world, took oc|ca&s;ion from thence to make a tran&s;ition from temporal to &s;piritual things. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;aith he (or <HI>happy;</HI> &s;o the word &s;hould be rendered, both in this and the following ver&s;es) <HI>are the poor in &s;pirit.</HI> He does not &s;ay, they that are <HI>poor</HI> as to <HI>outward circum&s;tances;</HI> it being not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the&s;e may be as far from happi|ne&s;s, as a monarch upon his throne: but <HI>the poor in &s;pirit,</HI> they who, whatever their outward circum&s;tances are, have that di&s;po&s;ition of heart, which is the fir&s;t &s;tep to all real, &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s, either in this world or that which is to come.</P>

3. Some have judged, That by the <HI>poor in &s;pirit</HI> here, are meant, tho&s;e who love poverty; tho&s;e who are free from covetou&s;ne&s;s; from the love of money; who fear, rather than de&s;ire riches.

<P N="6">6. But altho' this mourning is at an end, is lo&s;t in holy joy, by the return of the comforter, yet is there another, and a ble&s;&s;ed mourning it is, which abides in the children of God.

They &s;ee here the hou&s;e of God eternal in the heavens; there, hell and de&s;truc|tion without a covering; and thence feel the importance of every moment, which ju&s;t appears, and is gone for ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. But all this wi&s;dom of God is fooli&s;hne&s;s with the world. The whole affair of <HI>mourning</HI> and <HI>poverty of &s;pirit,</HI> is with them &s;tupidity and dulne&s;s.

And it is no won|der at all, that this judgment &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who know not God. Suppo&s;e as two per&s;ons were walking together, one &s;hould &s;ud|denly &s;top, and with the &s;tronge&s;t &s;igns of fear and amazement, cry out, "On what a preci|pice do we &s;tand! See, we are on the point of being da&s;ned in pieces! Another &s;tep, and we fall into that huge aby&s;s. Stop! I will not go on for all the world."

<P N="8">8. But let not the children of God, <HI>the mourn|ers in Sion,</HI> be moved by any of the&s;e things. Ye who&s;e eyes are enlightened, be not troubled by tho&s;e who walk on &s;till in darkne&s;s. Ye do not walk on in a vain &s;hadow: God and eternity are real things.

2. But who are the meek? Not tho&s;e who grieve at nothing, becau&s;e they know nothing; who are not di&s;compo&s;ed at the evils that occur, becau&s;e they di&s;cern not evil from good. Not tho&s;e who are &s;heltered from the &s;hocks of life, by a &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility; who have either by na|ture or art, the virtue of &s;tocks and &s;tones, and re&s;ent nothing, becau&s;e they feel nothing. Brute philo&s;ophers are wholly unconcerned in this matter. Apathy is as far from meekne&s;s as from humanity. So that one would not ea&s;ily conceive, how any chri&s;tians of the purer ages, e&s;pecially any of the fathers of the church, could confound the&s;e, and mi&s;take one of the foule&s;t errors of heatheni&s;m, for a branch of true chri&s;|tianity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor does chri&s;tian meekne&s;s imply, the be|ing without zeal for God, any more than it does ignorance or in&s;en&s;ibility. No; it keeps clear of every extreme, whether in exce&s;s or defect. It does not de&s;troy but balance the affections, which the God of Nature never de&s;igned &s;hould be rooted out by grace, but only brought and kept under due regulations. It poi&s;es the mind aright. It holds an even &s;cale, with regard to anger, and &s;orrow, and fear: pre&s;erving the mean in every circum&s;tance of life, and not declining either to the right-hand or the left.</P>
<P N="4">4. Meekne&s;s therefore &s;eems properly to relate to our&s;elves. But it may be referred either to God or our neighbour. When this due compo|&s;ure of mind has reference to God, it is u&s;ually termed re&s;ignation; a calm acquie&s;cence in what|&s;oever is his will concerning us, even though it may not be plea&s;ing to nature; &s;aying continu|ally,
<PB N="51" REF="028060_0324_0FD68CEC9628D618"><HI>It is the Lord; let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI> When we con&s;ider it more &s;trictly with re|gard to our&s;elves, we &s;tile it patience or content|edne&s;s. When it is exerted toward other men, then it is mildne&s;s to the good, and gentlene&s;s to the evil.</P>
<P N="5">5. They who are truly meek, can clearly di&s;|cern what is evil; and they can al&s;o &s;uffer it. They are <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of every thing of this kind; but &s;till meekne&s;s holds the reins. They are exceed|ing <HI>zealous for the Lord of Ho&s;ts;</HI> but their zeal is always guided by knowledge, and tempered in every thought, and word, and work, with the love of man as well as the love of God. They do not de&s;ire to extingui&s;h any of the pa&s;&s;ions, which God has for wi&s;e ends implanted in their nature. But they have the ma&s;tery of all; they hold them all in &s;ubjection, and employ them on|ly in &s;ub&s;ervience to tho&s;e ends. And thus even the har&s;her and more unplea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, are applicable to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they which do hunger and thir&s;t after</HI> this: in order fully to under&s;tand which expre&s;&s;ion, we &s;hould ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, That hun|ger and thir&s;t are the &s;tronge&s;t of all our bodily appetites. In like manner this hunger in the &s;oul, this thir&s;t after the image of God, is the &s;tronge&s;t of all our &s;pirituall appetites, when it is once awakened in the heart: yea, it &s;wal|lows up all the re&s;t in that one great de&s;ire, to he renewed after the likene&s;s of him that created us. We &s;hould, &s;econdly, ob&s;erve, that from the time we begin to hunger and thir&s;t, tho&s;e appetites do not cea&s;e but are more and more craving and importunate, till we either eat and

And even &s;o, from the time that we begin to hunger and thir&s;t after the whole mind which was in Chri&s;t, the&s;e &s;piritual appe|tites do not cea&s;e, but cry after their food with more and more importunity.

We may, Third|ly, ob&s;erve, That hunger and thir&s;t are &s;atisfi|ed with nothing but meat and drink. If you would give to him that is hungry all the world be&s;ide, all the elegance of apparel, all the trap|pings of &s;tate, all the trea&s;ure upon earth, yea thou&s;ands of gold and &s;ilver: if you would pay him ever &s;o much honour, he regards it not; all the&s;e things are then of no account with him.

He can find no comfort in any thing but this; he can be &s;a|tisfied with nothing el&s;e. Whatever you offer be&s;ides, it is lightly e&s;teemed; whether it be riches, or honour, or plea&s;ure, he &s;till &s;ays, this is not the thing which I want. Give me love or el&s;e I die!</P>

<P N="2">II. 1. Thus far our Lord has been more di|rectly employed, in teaching the religion of the heart.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The peace-makers:</HI> The word in the original is <GAP DESC="foreign"> It is well known that <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the &s;acred writings, implies all manner of good; eve|ry ble&s;&s;ing that relates either to the &s;oul or the bo|dy, to time or eternity. Accordingly when <HI>St.

<P N="3">3. Hence we may ea&s;ily learn, in how wide a &s;en&s;e, the term <HI>peace-makers</HI> is to be under&s;tood. In its literal meaning it implies, tho&s;e lovers of God and man, who utterly dete&s;t and abhor all &s;trife and debate, all variance and contention: and accordingly labour with all their might either to prevent this fire of hell from being kindled, or when it is kindled, from breaking out, or when it is broke out, from &s;preading any farther. They endeavour to calm the &s;tormy &s;pirits of men, to quiet their turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;often the minds of contending parties, and, if po&s;&s;ible, reconcile them to each other. They u&s;e all innocent arts, and employ all their &s;trength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to pre&s;erve peace, where it is, as to re&s;tore it, where it is not. It is the joy of then heart, to promote, to confirm, to increa&s;e mutual good-will among men: but more e&s;pecially among the children of God, how|ever di&s;tingui&s;hed by things of &s;maller importance. That as they have all <HI>one</HI> Lord, <HI>one faith;</HI> as they <HI>are</HI> all <HI>called in one hope of their calling,</HI> &s;o they may all <HI>walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called: with all lowline&s;s and meekne&s;s, with long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another in love; endea|vouring to keep the unity of the &s;pirit, in the bond of peace.</HI></P>

"Uncharitable creatures! that damn all the world, but tho&s;e that are of their own &s;ort! bla&s;phemous wretches, that pretend to make God a har, to live without &s;in!" above all, be|cau&s;e they are peace-makers, becau&s;e they take all opportunities of doing good to all men. This is the grand rea&s;on why they have been per|&s;ecuted in all ages, and will be till the re&s;tituti|on of all things.</P>
<P>"If they would but keep their religion to them&s;elves, it would be tolerable. But it is this
<PB N="92" REF="028060_0363_0FD68D4363CBE8F0">&s;preading their errors, this infecting &s;o many o|thers, which is not to be endured. They do &s;o much mi&s;chief in the world, that they ought to be tolerated no longer. It is true, the men do &s;ome things well enough; they relieve &s;ome of the poor. But this too, is only done to gain the more to their party; and &s;o, in effect, to do the more mi&s;chief." Thus the men of the world &s;incerely think and &s;peak. And the more the kingdom of God prevails, the more the peace-makers are enabled to propagate lowline&s;s, meek|ne&s;s, and all other divine tempers; the more mi&s;chief is done, in their account. Con&s;equent|ly, the more are they enraged, again&s;t the au|thors of this, and the more vehemently will they per&s;ecute them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us, Thirdly, enquire, who are they that per&s;ecute them? St. Paul an&s;wers, <HI>he that is born after the fle&s;h;</HI> every one who is not <HI>born of the &s;pirit,</HI> or at lea&s;t, de&s;irous &s;o to be: all that do not, at lea&s;t, labour to <HI>live godly in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us: all that are not <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life,</HI> and con&s;equently cannot <HI>love the brethren: the world,</HI> that is according to our &s;aviour's account, <HI>they who know not him that &s;ent me:</HI> they who know not God, even the loving, pardoning God, by the teaching of his own &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on is plain. The &s;pirit which is in the world is directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit which is of God. It mu&s;t therefore needs be that tho&s;e who are of the world, will be oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e who are of God. There is the utmo&s;t contra|riety between them, in all their opinions, their de&s;ires, de&s;igns, and tempers. And hitherto
<PB N="93" REF="028060_0364_0FD68D45239DB4D0"><HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pard and the kid,</HI> cannot <HI>lie down</HI> in peace <HI>together.</HI> The proud, becau&s;e he is proud, can|not but per&s;ecute the lowly; the light and airy, tho&s;e that mourn: and &s;o in every other kind; the unlikene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition (were there no o|ther) being a perpetual ground of earnity. There|fore (were it only on this account) all the &s;er|rants of the devil, will per&s;ecute the children of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Should it be enquired, fourthly, how they will per&s;ecute them? it may be an&s;wered in ge|neral, ju&s;t in that manner and mea&s;ure which the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of all, &s;ees will be mo&s;t for his glory; will tend mo&s;t to his children's growth in grace, and the enlargement of his own kingdom. There is no one branch of God's government of the world, which is more to be admired than this. His car is never heavy to the threatnings of the per&s;ecutor, or the cry of the per&s;ecuted. His eye is ever open, and his hand &s;tretched out, to direct every, the minute&s;t circum&s;tance. When the &s;torm &s;hall begin, how high it &s;hall ri&s;e, which way it &s;hall point its cour&s;e, when and how it &s;hall end, are all determined by his uner|ring wi&s;dom. The ungodly are only a &s;word of his: an in&s;trument which he u&s;es, as it plea&s;eth him, and which it&s;elf, when the gracious ends of his providence are an&s;wered, is ca&s;t into the fire.</P>
<P>At &s;ome rare times, as when chri&s;tianity was planted fir&s;t, and while it was taking root in the earth; as al&s;o when the pure doctrine of Chri&s;t began to be planted again in our nation: God permitted the &s;torm to ri&s;e high, and his children were called to re&s;i&s;t unto blood. There was a pe|culiar
<PB N="94" REF="028060_0365_0FD68D47C2131120">rea&s;on why he &s;uffered this with regard to the apo&s;tles, that their evidence might be the more unexceptionable. But from the annals of the church, we learn another, and a far different rea&s;on, why he &s;uffered the heavy per&s;ecutions which aro&s;e in the &s;econd and third centuries: namely, becau&s;e the my&s;tery of iniquity did &s;o &s;trongly work, becau&s;e of the mon&s;trous corrup|tions which even then reigned in the church: the&s;e God cha&s;ti&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time &s;trove to heal, by tho&s;e &s;evere but nece&s;&s;ary vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>Perhaps the &s;ame: ob&s;ervation may be made, with regard to the grand per&s;ecution in our own land. God had dealt very graciou&s;ly with out nation; he had poured out various ble&s;&s;ings upon us. He had given us peace abroad and at home; and a king wi&s;e and good, beyond his years. And above all, he had cau&s;ed the pure light of his go&s;|pel, to ari&s;e and &s;hine among&s;t us. But what re|turn did he find? <HI>be looked for righteou&s;ne&s;s. But behold a cry!</HI> a cry of oppre&s;&s;ion and wrong, of ambition and inju&s;tice, of malice and fraud and covetou&s;ne&s;s. Yea, the cry of tho&s;e who even then expired in the flames, entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth. It was then God aro&s;e to main|tain his own cau&s;e, again&s;t tho&s;e that held the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. Then he &s;old them into the hands of their per&s;ecutors, by a judgment mixt with mercy: an affliction to puni&s;h and yet a medi|cine to heal the grievous back&s;lidings of his people.</P>
<P N="6">6. But it is &s;eldom God &s;uffers the &s;torm to ri&s;e &s;o high, as torture or death or bonds or im|pri&s;onment. Whereas his children are frequently called to endure tho&s;e lighter kinds of per&s;ecution; they frequently &s;uffer the e&s;trangement of kins|folks;
<PB N="95" REF="028060_0366_0FD68D4997BF5C68">the lo&s;s of the friends that were as their own &s;oul. They find the truth of their Lord's word (concerning the event, though not the de|&s;ign of his coming) * <HI>Suppo&s;e ye that I am come to give peace upon earth? I tell you nay; but rather divi&s;ion.</HI> And hence will naturally follow lo&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s or employment, and con&s;equently of &s;ub|&s;tance. But all the&s;e circum&s;tances likewi&s;e are under the wi&s;e direction of God, who allots to every one what is mo&s;t expedient for him.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the per&s;ecution which attends all the children of God, is that our Lord de&s;cribes in the following words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you and per&s;ecute you</HI> (&s;hall per&s;ecute, by re|viling you) <HI>and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you, fal&s;ely, for my &s;ake.</HI> This cannot fail: it is the very badge of our di&s;ciple&s;hip: it is one of the &s;eals of our calling. It is a &s;ure portion, entailed on all the children of God: if we have it not, we are ba&s;tards and not &s;ons. Strait thro' <HI>evil re|port,</HI> as well as <HI>good report,</HI> lies the only way to the Kingdom. The meek, &s;erious, humble, zea|lous lovers of God and man, are of good report among their brethren; but of evil report with the world, who count and treat them <HI>as the filth and off-&s;couring of all things.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Indeed &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, that before the fulne&s;s of the gentiles &s;hall come in, the &s;candal of the cro&s;s will cea&s;e: that God will cau&s;e chri&s;|tians to be e&s;teemed and loved, even by tho&s;e who are as yet in their &s;ins. Yea, and &s;ure it is, that even now, he at &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pends the contempt as well as the fiercene&s;s of men: <HI>be makes a man's enemies to be at peace with him</HI> for a &s;ea&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 51.</NOTE>

Not &s;o: they may employ them &s;ometimes; but it is for their own profit. They may put confidence in them; for they know their ways are not like other men's. But &s;till they love them not; unle&s;s &s;o far as the &s;pirit of God may be &s;triving with them. Our Saviour's words are expre&s;s: <HI>if ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but becau&s;e ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI> Yea (&s;etting a&s;ide what exceptions may be made by the preventing grace or the peculiar providence of God) it hateth them as cordially and &s;incerely, as ever it did their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="9">9. It remains only to enquire, how are the children of God to behave, with regard to per&s;e|cution? and fir&s;t, they ought not knowingly or de&s;ignedly, to bring it upon them&s;elves. This is contrary both to the example and advice of our Lord and all his apo&s;tles; who teach us not only not to &s;eck, but to avoid it, as far as we can, with|out injuring our con&s;cience; without giving up any part of that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we are to prefer before life it&s;elf. So our Lord expre&s;sly, <HI>when they per&s;ecute you in this city, flee ye into ano|ther:</HI> which is indeed, when it can be taken, the mo&s;t unexceptionable way of avoiding per&s;ecution.</P>
<P N="10">10. Yet think not, that you can always avoid it either by this, or any other means. If ever that
<PB N="97" REF="028060_0368_0FD68D4EE17A1568">idle imagination &s;teals into your heart, put it to flight by that earne&s;t caution, <HI>remember the word that I &s;aid unto you, the &s;ervant is not greater th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> his</HI> Lord. <HI>If they have per&s;ecuted me, they will al&s;o per&s;ecute you.</HI> Be ye <HI>wi&s;e as &s;erpents and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|le&s;s as doves.</HI> But will this &s;creen you from per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">u|tion? not unle&s;s you have more wi&s;dom tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ur ma&s;ter, or more innocence than the Lamb of God.</P>
<P>Neither de&s;ire to avoid it, to e&s;cape it wholly; for if you do, you are none of his.

This inward religion bears the &s;hape of God, &s;o vi&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed upon it, that a &s;oul mu&s;t be wholly immer&s;ed in fle&s;h and blood, when he can doubt of its divine original. We may &s;ay of this, in a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e, even as of the Son of God him&s;elf, that it is the <HI>Bright|ne&s;s of his glory, the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>The beaming forth of his</HI> eternal <HI>glory;</HI> and yet &s;o tempered and &s;oftened, that even the children of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay herein &s;ee God and live: <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the cha|racter, the &s;tamp, the living impre&s;&s;ion, of his per|&s;on,</HI> who is the fountain of beauty and love, the original &s;ource of all excellency and perfection.</P>
<P N="3">3. If religion therefore were carried no far|ther than this, they could have no doubt con|cerning it: they &s;hould have no objection again&s;t pur&s;uing it with the whole ardor of their &s;ouls. But why, &s;ay they, is it clogged with other things? what need of loading it with <HI>doing</HI> and <HI>&s;uffering?</HI> the&s;e are what damps the vigour of the &s;oul and &s;inks it down to earth again Is it not enough, to <HI>follow after charity?</HI> to &s;oar upon the wings of love? will it not &s;uffice, to wor&s;hip God who is a &s;pirit, with the &s;pirit of our minds, without incumbering our&s;elves with out|ward things, or even thinking of them at all? is it not better, that the whole extent of our thought &s;hould be taken up with high and hea|venly contemplation? and that in&s;tead of bu&s;ying

<P N="4">4. Many eminent men have &s;poken thus; have advi&s;ed us "To cea&s;e from all outward ac|tion;" wholly to withdraw from the world; to leave the body behind us; to ab&s;tract our&s;elves from all &s;en&s;ible things: to have no concern at all about outward religion, but to "work all vir|tues in the will," as the far more excellent way, more perfective of the &s;oul, as well as more ac|ceptable to God.</P>
<P N="5">5. It needed not that any &s;hould tell our Lord, of this ma&s;ter-piece of the wi&s;dom from be|neath! this faire&s;t of all the devices wherewith <HI>&s;atan</HI> hath ever perverted the right ways of the Lord. And O! what in&s;truments hath he found from time to time, to employ in this his &s;ervice! to wield this grand engine of hell, again&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t important truths of God! men that <HI>would deceive if it were po&s;&s;ible the very elect;</HI> the men of faith and love: yea, that have for a &s;ea|&s;on deceived and led away no incon&s;iderable num|ber of them; who have fallen in all ages into the gilded &s;nare, and hardly e&s;caped with the &s;kin of their teeth.</P>
<P N="6">6. But has our Lord been wanting on his part? has he not &s;ufficently guarded us again&s;t this plea&s;ing delu&s;ion? has he not armed us here with armour of proof again&s;t &s;atan <HI>transformed into an angel of light?</HI> yea, verily: he here de|fends, in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t manner, the active, patient religion he had ju&s;t de&s;cribed: what can be fuller and plainer than the words he immediately &s;ubjoins, to what he had &s;aid of doing and &s;uffering? <HI>ye are the &s;alt of the earth.

<P>By chri&s;tianity I mean, that method of wor|&s;hipping God, which is here revealed to man by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

And in &s;hewing this, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e con&s;iderations, which will ari&s;e from the very di&s;cour&s;e before us.

Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we can in any wi&s;e condemn the in|termixing &s;olitude or retirement with &s;ociety. This is not only allowable, but expedient: nay, it is nece&s;&s;ary as daily experience &s;hews, for every one that either already is, or de&s;ires to be a real chri&s;tian. It can hardly be that we &s;hould &s;pend one entire day, in a continued intercour&s;e with men, without &s;uffering lo&s;s in our &s;oul, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure grieving the holy &s;pirit of God. We have need daily to retire from the world, at lea&s;t, morning and evening, to conver&s;e with God, to commune more freely with our Father which is in &s;ecret. Nor indeed can a man of experience condemn, even longer &s;ea&s;ons of re|ligious retirement, &s;o they do not imply any ne|glect of the worldly employ, wherein the provi|dence of God has placed us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yet &s;uch retirement mu&s;t not &s;wallow up all our time; this would be to de&s;troy, not ad|vance true religion. For, that the religion de|&s;cribed by our Lord in the foregoing words, can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ociety, without our living and conver&s;ing with other men, is manife&s;t from hence, that &s;everal of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches thereof, can have no place, if we have no inter|cour&s;e with the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no di&s;po&s;ition (for in&s;tance) which is more e&s;&s;ential to chri&s;tianity than meekne&s;s. Now altho' this, as it implies re&s;ignation to God, or patience in pain and &s;ickne&s;s, may &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a de&s;ert, in a hermit's cell, in total &s;olitude; yet as it implies (which it no le&s;s nece&s;&s;arily does) mild|ne&s;s, gentlene&s;s and long-&s;uffering, it cannot po&s;|&s;ibly have a being, it has no place under hea|ven, without an intercour&s;e with other men.
<PB N="110" REF="028060_0379_0FD68D67EF5A7790">So that to attempt turning this into a &s;olita|ry virtue, is to de&s;troy it from the face of the earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another nece&s;&s;ary branch of true chri&s;ti|anity, is peace-making, or doing of good. That this is equally e&s;&s;ential with any of the other parts of the religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> there can be no &s;tronger argument to evince (and therefore it would be ab&s;urd to allege any other) than that it is here in&s;erted in the original plan he has laid down, of the fundamentals of his religion. Therefore to &s;et a&s;ide this, is the &s;ame daring in|&s;ait on the authority of our great ma&s;ter, as to &s;et a&s;ide mercifulne&s;s, purity of heart, or any other branch of his in&s;titution. But this is ap|parently &s;et a&s;ide, by all who call us to the wil|derne&s;s; who recommend entire &s;olitude either to the babes, or the young men, or the fathers in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> For will any man affirm, that a &s;oli|tary chri&s;tian (&s;o called, tho' it is little le&s;s than a contradiction in terms) can be a merciful man? that is, one that takes every opportunity of do|ing all good to all men? what can be more plain, than that this fundamental branch of the religi|on of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out &s;ociety, without our living and conver&s;ing with other men?</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P>And, Fir&s;t, It is impo&s;&s;ible for any that have it, to conceal the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This our Lord makes plain beyond all contradiction, by a two-fold compari&s;on. <HI>Ye are the light of the world. A city &s;et upon an hill cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ye</HI> chri&s;tians <HI>are the light of the world,</HI> with regard both to your tempers and actions. Your holine&s;s makes you as con&s;picuous, as the &s;un in the mid&s;t of heaven. As ye cannot go out of the world, &s;o neither can ye &s;tay in it, without appearing to all mankind. Ye may not flee from men, and while ye are among them, it is impo&s;&s;ible to hide your lowline&s;s and meek|ne&s;s, and tho&s;e other di&s;po&s;itions whereby ye a&s;|pire to be perfect, as your Father which is in hea|ven is perfect. Love cannot be hid any more than light; and lea&s;t of all, when it &s;hines forth in action; when ye exerci&s;e your&s;elves in the la|bour of love, in beneficence of every kind. As well may men think to hide a city, as to hide a chri&s;tian: yea, as well may they conceal a
<PB N="117" REF="028060_0386_0FD68D79B63E8D08">city &s;et upon a hill, as a holy, zealous, active lover of God and man.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is true, men who love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil, will take all po&s;&s;ible pains to prove, that the light which is in you is darkne&s;s. They will &s;ay evil, all manner of evil, fal&s;ely, of the good which is in you: they will lay to your charge that which is farthe&s;t from your thoughts, which is the very re|ver&s;e of all you are and all you do. And your patient continuance in well-doing, your meek &s;uffering all things for the Lord's &s;ake, your calm, humble joy in the mid&s;t of per&s;ecution, your un|wearied labour to overcome evil with good, will make you &s;till more vi&s;ible and con&s;picuous than ye were before.</P>
<P N="4">4. So impo&s;&s;ible it is, to keep our religion from being &s;een, unle&s;s we ca&s;t it away: &s;o vain is the thought, of hiding the light, unle&s;s by putting it out. Sure it is, that a &s;ecret, unob|&s;erved religion cannot be the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whatever religion can be concealed, is not chri&s;tianity. If a chri&s;tian could be hid, he could not be compared to a city &s;et upon an hill; to the light of the world, the &s;un &s;hining from heaven, and &s;een by all the world below. Never therefore let it enter into the heart of him whom God hath renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind, to hide that light, to keep his religion to him&s;elf; e&s;pecially con&s;idering it is not only impo&s;&s;ible to conceal true chri&s;tianity, but likewi&s;e ab&s;olute|ly contrary to the de&s;ign of the great author of it.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="028060_0387_0FD68D7B449CE880">under a bu&s;hel.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, as men do not light a candle, only to cover and conceal it, &s;o neither does God enlighten any &s;oul with his glo|rious knowledge and love, to have it covered or concealed, either by prudence, fal&s;ely &s;o called, or &s;hame, or voluntary humility: to have it hid either in a de&s;ert, or in the world; either by a|voiding men, or in conver&s;ing with them. <HI>But they put it on a candle&s;tick, and it giveth light to all that are in the hou&s;e.</HI> In like manner, it is the de&s;ign of God, that every chri&s;tian &s;hould be in an open point of view: that he may give light to all around, that he may vi&s;ibly expre&s;s the re|ligion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus hath God in all ages &s;poken to the world, not only by precept but by example al&s;o. He hath <HI>not left him&s;elf without witne&s;s</HI> in any nation, where the &s;ound of the go&s;pel had gone forth, without a few who te&s;tified his truth, by their lives as well as their words. The&s;e have been <HI>as lights &s;hining in a dark place.</HI> And from time to time they have been the means of enlight|ening &s;ome, of pre&s;erving a remnant, a little &s;eed, which was <HI>counted unto the</HI> Lord <HI>for a gene|ration.</HI> They have led a few poor &s;heep out of the darkne&s;s of the world, and guided their feet into the way of peace.</P>
<P N="7">7. One might imagine, that where both &s;crip|ture and the rea&s;on of things &s;peak &s;o clearly and expre&s;sly, there could not be much advanced on the other &s;ide, at lea&s;t, not with any appear|ance of truth. But they who imagine thus, know little of the depths of <HI>Satan.</HI> After all that &s;cripture and rea&s;on have &s;aid, &s;o exceeding plau&s;ible are the pretences for &s;olitary religion,
<PB N="119" REF="028060_0388_0FD68D7CA7040D68">for a chri&s;tian's going out of the world, or at lea&s;t hiding him&s;elf in it, that we need all the wi&s;dom of God to &s;ee through the &s;nare, and all the power of God to e&s;cape it: &s;o many and &s;trong are the objections which have been brought, again&s;t being &s;ocial, open, active chri&s;|tians.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. To an&s;wer the&s;e was the third thing which I propo&s;ed. And, fir&s;t, it has been often objected, that religion does not lie in outward things, but in the heart, the inmo&s;t &s;oul: that it is the union of the &s;oul with God, the life of God in the &s;oul of man: that out&s;ide religion is nothing worth; &s;eeing God <HI>delighteth not in burnt-offerings,</HI> in outward &s;ervices, but a pure and holy heart is the <HI>&s;acrifice he will not de&s;pi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, it is mo&s;t true, that the root of re|ligion lies in the heart, in the inmo&s;t &s;oul: that this is, the union of the &s;oul with God; the life of God in the &s;oul of man. But if this root be really in the heart, it cannot but put forth branches. And the&s;e are, the &s;everal in|&s;tances of outward obedience, which partake of the &s;ame nature with the root; and con&s;equently, are not only marks or &s;igns, but &s;ub&s;tantial parts of religion.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o true, that bare out&s;ide religion, which has no root in the heart, is nothing worth; that God delighteth not in <HI>&s;uch</HI> outward &s;er|vices, no more than in Jewi&s;h burnt-offerings, and that a pure and holy heart is a &s;acrifice, with which he is always well plea&s;ed. But he is al&s;o well plea&s;ed with all that outward &s;ervice, which
<PB N="120" REF="028060_0389_0FD68D7E18E73A98">ari&s;es from the heart: with the &s;acrifice of our prayers (whether public or private) of our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;es and thank&s;givings: with the &s;acrifice of our goods, humbly devoted to him, and employ|ed wholly to his glory: and with that of our bodies, which he peculiarly claims; which the apo&s;tle <HI>be&s;eeches</HI> us, <HI>by the mercies of</HI> God, <HI>to pre|&s;ent unto him, a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable to</HI> God.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd objection, nearly related to this is, that love is all in all: that it is <HI>the fulfilling of the &s;aw, the end of the commandment,</HI> of every com|mandment of God: that all we do and all we &s;uffer, if we have not charity, or love, profiteth us nothing: and therefore the apo&s;tle directs us, <HI>to follow after charity,</HI> and terms this, <HI>the more excellent way.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, it is granted, that the love of God and man, ari&s;ing from <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> is all in all, the fulfilling of the law, the end of every commandment of God. It is true, that without this whatever we do, whatever we &s;uffer profits us nothing. But it does not follow, that love is all in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to &s;upe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cede either faith or good works. It is <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI> not by relea&s;ing us from, but by con&s;training us to obey it. It is <HI>the end of the commandment,</HI> as every commandment leads to and centres in it. It is allowed, that whatever we do or &s;uffer, without love, profits us nothing. But withal whatever we do or &s;uffer in love, though it were only the &s;uffering reproach for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or the giv|ing a cup of cold water in his name, it &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e its reward.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="121" REF="028060_0390_0FD68D8751E16868">
3. "But does not the apo&s;tle direct us, to <HI>fol|low after charity?</HI> And does he not term it, <HI>a more excellent way?</HI>"&mdash;He does direct us to <HI>follow after charity.</HI> But not after that alone. His words are,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Follow after charity; and de&s;ire &s;pi|ritual gifts.</HI> Yea, <HI>follow after charity;</HI> and de&s;ire to &s;pend and to be &s;pent for your brethren. <HI>Fol|low after charity;</HI> and as you have opportunity, do good to all men.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame ver&s;e al&s;o, wherein he terms this, The way of love, <HI>a more excellent way,</HI> he directs the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to de&s;ire other gifts be&s;ides it: yea, to de&s;ire them earne&s;tly.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 31.</NOTE> <HI>Covet earne&s;tly,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>the be&s;t gifts: And yet I &s;hew unto you a more excellent way.</HI> More excellent than what? Than the gifts of <HI>healing,</HI> of <HI>&s;peaking with tongues,</HI> and of <HI>interpreting,</HI> mentioned in the preceding ver&s;e. But not more excellent than the way of obedience. Of this the apo&s;tle is not &s;peaking. Neither is he &s;peaking of outward religion at all. So that this text is quite wide of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the apo&s;tle had been &s;peaking of outward as well as inward religion, and com|paring them together: &s;uppo&s;e in the compari&s;on he had given the preference ever &s;o much to the latter: &s;uppo&s;e he had preferred (as he ju&s;tly might) a loving heart, before all outward works whatever: Yet it would not follow, that we were to reject, either one or the other. No; God hath joined them together from the beginning of the world. And let not man put them a&s;under.</P>

4. "But God <HI>is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> And is not this enough? Nay, ought we not to employ the whole &s;trength of our mind herein? Does not attending to outward things, clog the &s;oul, that it cannot &s;oar aloft in holy contemplation?

Whereas St. <HI>Paul</HI> would have us <HI>to be without carefulne&s;s,</HI> and to <HI>wait upon the</HI> Lord <HI>without di&s;traction.</HI>"</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, God is a Spirit, and they that wor|&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth. Yea, and this is enough: we ought to employ the whole &s;trength of our mind therein. But then I would a&s;k, What is it to wor&s;hip God, a Spirit, in &s;pirit and in truth? Why, it is to wor|&s;hip him with our &s;pirit; to wor&s;hip him in that manner, which none but &s;pirits are capable of. It is, to believe in him, as a wi&s;e, ju&s;t, holy Being, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: and yet merciful, gracious, and long-&s;uffering; forgiving iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in: ca&s;t|ing all our &s;ins behind his back, and accepting us in the beloved. It is, To love him, to delight in him, to de&s;ire him, with all our heart, and mind, and &s;oul, and &s;trength: to imitate him we love, by purifying our&s;elves, even as he is pure; and to obey him whom we love and in whom we believe, both in thought, and word, and work. Con&s;equently, one branch of the wor&s;hipping God in &s;pirit and in truth, is the keeping his out|ward commandments. To glorify him therefore with our bodies as well as with our &s;pirits, to go
<PB N="123" REF="028060_0392_0FD68D8A51F22978">thro' outward work with hearts lifted up to him, to make our daily employment a &s;acrifice to God; to buy and &s;ell, to eat and drink to his glory: this is wor&s;hipping God in &s;pirit and in truth, as much as the praying to him in a wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if &s;o, then contemplation is only one way of wor&s;hipping God in &s;pirit and in truth. Therefore to give our&s;elves up entirely to this, would be to de&s;troy many branches of &s;piritual wor&s;hip, all equally acceptable to God, and equally profitable, not hurtful, to the &s;oul. For it is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that an attention to tho&s;e outward things, whereto the providence of God hath called us, is any clog to a chri&s;tian, or any hinderance at all to his always &s;eeing him that is invi&s;ible. It does not at all damp the ar|dor of his thought, it does not incumber or di|&s;tract his mind; it gives him no unea&s;y or hurt|ful care, who does it all as unto the Lord: who hath learned, what&s;oever he doth in word or deed, to do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us: having only one eye of the &s;oul, which moves round on outward things, and one immovably fixed on God. Learn what this meaneth, ye poor reclu&s;es, that you may clearly di&s;cern your own littlene&s;s of faith. Yea, that you may no longer judge others by your&s;elves, go and learn what that meaneth:
<Q><L>Thou, O Lord, in tender love</L>
<L>Do&s;t all my burdens bear;</L>
<L>Lift my heart to things above,</L>
<L>And &s;ix it ever there.</L>

<P N="6">6. But the grand objection is &s;till behind. "We appeal, &s;ay they, to experience. Our light did &s;hine: we u&s;ed outward things many years: and yet they profited nothing. We at|tended on all the ordinances: but we were no better for it; nor indeed any one el&s;e: nay we were the wor&s;e. For we fancied our&s;elves chri|&s;tians for &s;o doing, when we knew not what chri|&s;tianity meant."</P>
<P>I allow the fact. I allow that you and ten thou|&s;and more have thus abu&s;ed the ordinances of God: mi&s;taking the means for the end: &s;uppo|&s;ing that the doing the&s;e, or &s;ome other outward works, either was the religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or would be accepted in the place of it. But let the abu&s;e be taken away and the u&s;e remain. Now u&s;e all outward things; but u&s;e them with a con&s;tant eye to the renewal of your &s;oul in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. But this is not all. They affirm, "Expe|rience likewi&s;e &s;hews, that the trying to do good is but lo&s;t labour: what does it avail to feed or cloath men's bodies, if they are ju&s;t dropping into everla&s;ting fire? and what good can any man do to their &s;ouls? if the&s;e are changed, God doth it him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, all men are ei|ther good, at lea&s;t de&s;irous &s;o to be, or ob&s;ti|nately evil. Now the former have no need of us. Let them a&s;k help of God, and it &s;hall be
<PB N="125" REF="028060_0394_0FD68D8E93644F48">given them. And the latter will receive no help from us. Nay, and our Lord forbids, to <HI>ca&s;t our pearls before &s;wine.</HI>"</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, 1. Whether they will finally be lo&s;t or &s;aved, you are expre&s;sly commanded to feed the hungry and cloath the naked. If you can, and do not, whatever becomes of them, you &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting fire. 2. Though it is God only changes hearts, yet he generally doth it by man. It is our part to do all that in us lies, as diligently as if we could change them our&s;elves, and then to leave the event to him. 3. God in an&s;wer to their prayers, builds up his children by each other in every good gift; nouri&s;hing and &s;trengthening the whole <HI>body, by that which every joint &s;upplieth.</HI> So that <HI>the eye cannot &s;ay to the hand, I have no need of thee;</HI> no, nor even <HI>the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</HI> La&s;tly, how are you a&s;&s;ured, that the per&s;ons before you are dogs or &s;wine? judge them not, until you have tried. <HI>How knowe&s;t thou, O man, but thou maye&s;t gain thy brother?</HI> but thou maye&s;t under God, &s;ave his &s;oul from death? when he &s;purns thy love and bla&s;phemes the good word, then it is time to give him up to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. "We have tried. We have laboured to reform &s;inners. And what did it avail? on ma|ny we could make no impre&s;&s;ion at all: and if &s;ome were changed for a while, yet their good|ne&s;s was but as the morning dew; and they were &s;oon as bad, nay, wor&s;e than ever. So that we only hurt them&mdash;and our&s;elves too; for our minds were hurried and di&s;compo&s;ed; perhaps filled with anger in&s;tead of love. Therefore
<PB N="126" REF="028060_0395_0FD68D944D67F220">we had better have kept our religion to our|&s;elves."</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible this fact al&s;o may be true: that you have tried to do good and have not &s;uc|ceeded; yea, that tho&s;e who &s;eemed reformed, relap&s;ed into &s;in, and their la&s;t &s;tate was wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. And what marvel? is the &s;er|vant above his ma&s;ter? but how often did he &s;trive to &s;ave &s;inners: and they would not hear: or when they had followed him a while, they turned back as a dog to his vomit. But he did not therefore de&s;i&s;t from &s;triving to do good: no more &s;hould you, whatever your &s;ucce&s;s be. It is your part, to do as you are commanded: the event is in the hand of God. You are not ac|countable for this: leave it to him, who orders all things well. <HI>In the morning &s;ow thy &s;eed, and in the evening withold not thy hand; for thou know|e&s;t not whether &s;hall pro&s;per,</HI> Eccle&s;. ix. 6.</P>
<P>"But the trial hurries and frets your own &s;oul." Perhaps it did &s;o for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e you thought you was accountable for the event, which no man is, nor indeed can be. Or perhaps, becau&s;e you was off your guard; you was not watchful ever your own &s;pirit. But this is no rea&s;on for di&s;obeying God. Try again; but try more warily than before. Do good (as you forgive) <HI>not &s;even times only; but until &s;eventy times &s;even.</HI> Only be wi&s;er by experience: at|tempt it every time more cautiou&s;ly than be|fore. Be more humbled before God, more deeply convinced, that of your&s;elf you can do nothing. Be more jealous over your own &s;pirit:

<P>The ritual or ceremonial law, delivered by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> containing all the injunctions and ordinances which related to the old &s;acrifices and &s;ervice of the temple, our Lord indeed did come to de&s;troy, to di&s;&s;olve and utterly aboli&s;h.

<P N="2">2. But the moral law, contained in the ten commandments, and inforced by the prophets, he did not take away. It was not the de&s;ign of his coming, to revoke any part of this. This is a law which never can be broken, which <HI>&s;tands fa&s;t as the faithful witne&s;s in heaven.</HI> The moral &s;tands on an entirely different foundation, from the ceremonial or ritual law; which was only de|&s;igned for a temporary re&s;traint upon a di&s;obedi|ent and &s;tiff-necked people: whereas this was from the beginning of the world; being <HI>written not on tables of &s;tone,</HI> but on the hearts of all the children of men, when they came out of the hands of the Creator. And however the letters once wrote by the finger of God, are now in a great mea&s;ure defaced by &s;in, yet can they not wholly be blotted out, while we have any con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of good and evil. Every part of this law mu&s;t remain in force, upon all mankind, and in all ages: as not depending either on time or place, or any other circum&s;tances liable to change; but on the nature of God, and the na|ture
<PB N="136" REF="028060_0403_0FD68DA71C0E82A8">of man, and their unchangeable relation to each other.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I am not come to de&s;troy but to fulfil.</HI> Some have conceived our Lord to mean, I am come to fulfil this, by my entire and perfect obedience to it. And it cannot be doubted but he did, in this &s;en&s;e, fulfil every part of it. But this does not appear to be what he intends here, being foreign to the &s;cope of his pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. Without que&s;tion his meaning in this place is (con&s;i&s;tently with all that goes before and follows after) <HI>I am come</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h it in its fulne&s;s, in &s;pite of all the glo&s;&s;es of men. I am come to place in a full and clear view, what&s;oever was dark or ob&s;cure therein. I am come to declare the true and full import of every part of it: to &s;hew the length and breadth, the entire extent of every commandment contained therein; and the height and depth, the inconceivable purity and &s;pirituality of it in all its branches.</P>
<P N="4">4. And this our Lord has abundantly perform|ed in the preceding and &s;ub&s;equent parts of the di&s;cour&s;e before us: in which he has not intro|duced a new religion into the world, but the &s;ame which was from the beginning: a religion, the &s;ub&s;tance of which is without que&s;tion, "as old as the creation;" being co&euml;val with man, and having proceeded from God, at the very time when <HI>man became a living &s;oul</HI> (the &s;ub&s;tance, I &s;ay, for &s;ome circum&s;tances of it, now relate to man as a fallen creature.) A religion witne&s;&s;ed to both by the law, and by the prophets in all &s;uc|ceeding generations. Yet was it never &s;o fully explained, nor &s;o throughly under&s;tood, till the
<PB N="137" REF="028060_0404_0FD68DA818BD4080">great author of it him&s;elf, conde&s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to give mankind this authentic comment on all the e&s;&s;en|tial branches of it: at the &s;ame time declaring it &s;hould never be changed, but remain in force to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. <HI>For verily I &s;ay unto you</HI> (a &s;olemn pre|face, which denotes both the importance and certainty of what is &s;poken) <HI>till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law till all be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One jot</HI>&mdash;it is literally, <HI>not one Iota,</HI> not the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable vowel, <HI>or one tittle,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, one corner, or point of a con&s;onant. It is a proverbial expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;ignifies that no one commandment contained in the moral law, nor the lea&s;t part of one, however incon&s;iderable it might &s;eem, &s;hould ever be di&s;annulled.</P>
<P><HI>Shall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. The double negative here u&s;ed, &s;trengthens the &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to admit of no con|tradiction. And the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, it may be ob&s;erved, is not barely <HI>future;</HI> declaring what <HI>will</HI> be; but has likewi&s;e the force of an <HI>impera|tive;</HI> ordering what <HI>&s;hall</HI> be. It is a word of authority, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ovareign will and pow|er of him that &s;pake: of him who&s;e word is the law of heaven and earth, and &s;tands fa&s;t for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>One jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s, till heaven and earth pa&s;s;</HI> or as it is expre&s;&s;ed imme|diately after, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>till all</HI> (or ra|ther <HI>all things</HI>) <HI>be fulfilled,</HI> till the con&s;ummati|on of all things. Here is therefore no room for that poor eva&s;ion (with which &s;ome have de|lighted
<PB N="138" REF="028060_0405_0FD68DAC33A53100">them&s;elves greatly) that "no part of the law was to pa&s;s away, till <HI>all the law</HI> was fulfil|led: but it has been fulfilled by <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and there|fore now mu&s;t pa&s;s, for the go&s;pel to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed." Not &s;o; the word <HI>all</HI> does not mean all the law, but all things in the univer&s;e; as neither has the term <HI>fulfilled,</HI> any reference to the law, but to all things in heaven and earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. From all this we may learn, that there is no contrariety at all, between the law and the go&s;pel; that there is no need for the law to pa&s;s away, in order to the e&s;tabli&s;hing the go&s;pel. Indeed neither of them &s;upercedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very &s;ame words, con&s;idered in different re|&s;pects, are parts both of the law and of the go&s;pel: if they are con&s;idered as commandments, they are parts of the law; if as promi&s;es, of the go&s;pel. Thus, <HI>thou &s;halt love the</HI> Lord <HI>thy</HI> God <HI>with all thy heart,</HI> when con&s;idered as a com|mandment, is a branch of the law; when re|garded as a promi&s;e, is an e&s;&s;ential part of the go&s;pel: the go&s;pel being no other than the com|mands of the law, propo&s;ed by way of pro|mi&s;es. Accordingly poverty of &s;pirit, purity of heart, and whatever el&s;e is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a go&s;pel light, than &s;o many great and precious promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is therefore the clo&s;e&s;t connexion that can be conceived, between the law and the go&s;pel. On the one hand, the law continually makes way for, and points us to the go&s;pel: on the other, the go&s;pel continually leads us to a
<PB N="139" REF="028060_0406_0FD68DAE1530F128">more exact fulfilling of the law. The law, for in&s;tance, requires us to love God, to love our neighbour, to be meek, humble or holy: we feel that we are not &s;ufficient for the&s;e things; yea, that <HI>with man this is impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> But we &s;ee a promi&s;e of God, to give us that love, and to make us humble, meek and holy. We lay hold of this go&s;pel, of the&s;e glad tidings; it is done unto us according to our faith: and <HI>the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the law is fulfilled in us,</HI> through faith which is in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>We may yet farther ob&s;erve, that every com|mand in holy writ, is only a covered promi&s;e. For by that &s;olemn declaration, <HI>this is the cove|nant I will make after tho&s;e days, &s;aith the</HI> Lord, <HI>I will put my laws in your minds, and write them in your hearts,</HI> God hath engaged to give what&s;oe|ver he commands. Does he command us then to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing?</HI> to <HI>rejoice evermore?</HI> to be <HI>holy as he is holy?</HI> it is enough. He will work in us this very thing. It &s;hall be unto us ac|cording to his word.</P>
<P N="4">4. But if the&s;e things are &s;o, we cannot be at a lo&s;s, what to think of tho&s;e who in all ages of the church, have undertaken to change or &s;uper|cede &s;ome commands of God, as they profe&s;&s;ed, by the peculiar direction of his Spirit. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has here given us an infallible rule, whereby to judge of all &s;uch preten&s;ions. Chri&s;tianity, as it includes the whole moral law of God, both by way of injunction and of promi&s;e, if we will hear him, is de&s;igned of God, to be the la&s;t of all his di&s;pen&s;ations. There is no other to come after this. This is to endure till the con&s;umma|tion of all things. Of con&s;equence all &s;uch
<PB N="140" REF="028060_0407_0FD68DAFF34F1608">new revelations, are of Satan and not of God; and all pretences to another more perfect di&s;|pen&s;ation, fall to the ground of cour&s;e. <HI>Hea|ven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away: But</HI> this <HI>word &s;hall not pa&s;s away:</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commandments, and &s;hall teach men &s;o, he &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven: But who&s;oever &s;hall do and teach them, the &s;ame &s;hall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Who, what are they, that make "The preach|ing of the law," a character of reproach? do they not &s;ee on whom the reproach mu&s;t fall? on who&s;e head it mu&s;t light at la&s;t? who&s;oever on this ground de&s;pi&s;eth us, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent us. For did ever any man preach the law like him? even when he <HI>came, not to condemn but to &s;ave the world:</HI> when he came purpo&s;ely to <HI>bring life and immortality to light through the go&s;pel?</HI> can any "preach the law" more expre&s;sly, more rigorou&s;ly, than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> does in the&s;e words? and who is he that &s;hall amend them? who is he that &s;hall in&s;truct the Son of God, how to preach? who will teach him a better way of de|livering the me&s;&s;age which he hath received of the Father?</P>

<PB N="141" REF="028060_0408_0FD68DB1F19567B8">or enforced it, as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>

So that no allow|ance is made for one darling lu&s;t; no re&s;erve for one idol; no excu&s;e for refraining from all be|&s;ides, and only giving way to one bo&s;om &s;in. What God demands is, an entire obedience; we are to have an eye to all his commandments: otherwi&s;e we lo&s;e all the labour we take in keeping &s;ome, and our poor &s;ouls for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>One of the&s;e lea&s;t,</HI> or one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e <HI>commandments.</HI>&mdash;Here is another excu&s;e cut off, whereby many, who cannot deceive God, mi&s;e|rably deceive their own &s;ouls. "This &s;in, &s;aith the &s;inner, is it not a little one? will not the Lord &s;pare me in this thing? &s;urely he will not be extreme to mark this, &s;ince I do not offend in the greater matters of the law." Vain hope! &s;peaking after the manner of men, we may term the&s;e great and tho&s;e little commandments. But in reality, they are not &s;o. If we u&s;e propriety of &s;peech, there is no &s;uch thing as a little &s;in: every &s;in being a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the holy and perfect law, and an affront of the great maje&s;ty of heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And &s;hall teach men &s;o</HI>&mdash;In &s;ome &s;en&s;e it may be &s;aid, that who&s;oever openly breaks any commandment, teaches others to do the &s;ame: for example &s;peaks, and many times louder than
<PB N="142" REF="028060_0409_0FD68DB355093160">precept. In this &s;en&s;e it is apparent every open drunkard, is a teacher of drunkenne&s;s: every &s;abbath-breaker is con&s;tantly teaching his neigh|bour, to profane the day of the Lord. But this is not all; an habitual breaker of the law, is &s;eldom content to &s;top here. He generally teach|es other men to do &s;o too, by word as well as ex|ample: e&s;pecially when he hardens his neck, and hateth to be reproved. Such a &s;inner &s;oon com|mences an advocate for &s;in: he defends what he is re&s;olved not to for&s;ake. He excu&s;es the &s;in which he will not leave, and thus directly teaches every &s;in which he commits.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;hall be called lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven:</HI> that is, &s;hall have no part therein.

<P N="4">4.

"From any demand of the law no man is obliged now to go one &s;tep, to give away one farthing, to eat or omit one mor&s;el." This is indeed carrying matters with a high hand.

2.

Not that they made any formal &s;eparation from, or divi&s;ion in the national church. They were only di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, by greater &s;trictne&s;s of life, by more exactne&s;s of conver&s;ation.

<P>Many of the &s;cribes were of the &s;ect of the phari&s;ees. Thus St. Paul him&s;elf, who was edu|cated for a &s;cribe, fir&s;t at the univer&s;ity of Tar&s;us, and after that in Jeru&s;alem, at the feet of Gama|liel (one of the mo&s;t learned &s;cribes or doctors of the law that were then in the nation) declares of him&s;elf before the council,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>I am a phari&s;ee, the &s;on of a phari&s;ee:</HI> and before king Agrippa,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxvi. 5.</NOTE> <HI>after the &s;traite&s;t &s;ect of our religion I lived a phari&s;ee.</HI> And the whole body of the &s;cribes ge|nerally e&s;teemed and acted in concert with the phari&s;ees.

<P N="3">3. What <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees</HI> really was, it is not difficult to deter|mine. Our Lord has pre&s;erved an authentic ac|count, which one of them gave of him&s;elf.

<P><HI>I am not as other men are.</HI> This is not a &s;mall point. It is not every man that can &s;ay this. It is as if he had &s;aid, I do not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be carried away by that great torrent, cu&s;tom.

<P N="4">4. <HI>I fa&s;t twice in the week.</HI> There is more implied in this, than we may at fir&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of. All the &s;tricter phari&s;ees ob&s;erved the weekly

On the&s;e days, they took no &s;u&s;tenance at all till three in the afternoon; the hour at which they began to of|fer up the evening &s;acrifice in the temple. Till that hour it was their cu&s;tom to remain in the temple, in &s;ome of the corners, apartments or courts thereof; that they might be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t at all the &s;acrifices, and to join in all the pub|lic prayers. The time between, they were ac|cu&s;tomed to employ, partly in private addre&s;&s;es to God, partly in &s;earching the &s;criptures, in read|ing the law and the prophets, and in meditating thereon. Thus much is implied in, <HI>I fa&s;t twice in the week,</HI> the &s;econd branch of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of a phari&s;ee.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI> This the phari&s;ees did with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. They would not except the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable thing, no, not mint, ani&s;e and cummin. They would not keep back the lea&s;t part of what they believed properly to belong to God; but gave a full tenth of their whole &s;ub&s;tance yearly, and of all their increa&s;e, what&s;oever it was.</P>
<P>Yea, the &s;tricter phari&s;ees (as has been often ob&s;erved, by tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the ancient Jewi&s;h writings) not content with giving one tenth of their &s;ub&s;tance to God, in his prie&s;ts and levites, gave another tenth to God in the poor, and that continually. They gave the &s;ame
<PB N="150" REF="028060_0417_0FD68DC8812044E0">proportion of all they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alms, as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to give in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hes.

<P N="6">6. This was <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees:</HI> a righteou&s;ne&s;s, which in many re|&s;pects, went far beyond the conception which many have been accu&s;tomed to entertain concern|ing it. But perhaps, it will be &s;aid, it was all fal&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> feigned; for they were all a company of hypocrites.&mdash;Some of them doubtle&s;s were; men who had really no religion at all; no fear of God, or de&s;ire to plea&s;e him: who had no concern for the honour that cometh of God, but only for the prai&s;e of men. And the&s;e are they whom our Lord &s;o &s;everely condemns, &s;o &s;harply reproves on many occa&s;ions. But we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e many phari&s;ees were hypocrites, therefore all were &s;o. Nor indeed is hypocri&s;y by any means e&s;&s;ential to the cha|racter of a phari&s;ee. This is not the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing mark of their &s;ect. It is rather this (accord|ing to our Lord's account) <HI>they tru&s;ted in them|&s;elves that they were righteous, and de&s;pi&s;ed others.</HI> This is their genuine badge. But the phari&s;ee of this kind cannot be a hypocrite. He mu&s;t be, in the common &s;en&s;e, &s;incere: otherwi&s;e he could not <HI>tru&s;t in him&s;elf that he is righteous.</HI> The man who was here commending him&s;elf to God, unque&s;tionably thought him&s;elf righte|ous. Con&s;equently, he was no hypocrite: he
<PB N="151" REF="028060_0418_0FD68DCA3371A1C8">was not con&s;cious to him&s;elf of any in&s;incerity. He now &s;poke to God ju&s;t what he thought, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly, that he was abundantly better than other men.</P>
<P>But the example of St. Paul, were there no other, is &s;ufficient, to put this out of all que&s;ti|on. He could not only &s;ay, when he was a chri&s;|tian,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 16.</NOTE> <HI>herein do I exerci&s;e my&s;elf, to have always a con&s;cience void of offence, toward</HI> God <HI>and toward men:</HI> but even concerning the time when he was a phari&s;ee;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxiii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>men and brethren, I have lived in all good con&s;cience before</HI> God <HI>until this day.</HI> He was therefore &s;incere when he was a phari&s;ee, as well as when he was a chri&s;tian. He was no more an hypocrite when he per&s;ecuted the church, than when he preached the faith which once he per&s;ecuted. Let this then be added to <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees,</HI> a &s;in|cere belief that they are righteous, and in all things <HI>doing</HI> God <HI>&s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. And yet, <HI>except your righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, <HI>&s;hall exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the king|dom of heaven.</HI> A &s;olemn and weighty declara|tion! and which it behoves all who are called by the name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply to con|&s;ider.

<P>But, to come clo&s;er. Can we u&s;e his fir&s;t plea with God, which is in &s;ub&s;tance, "I do no harm. I live in no outward &s;in; I do nothing, for which my own heart condemns me." Do you not? are you &s;ure of that? do you live in no practi&s;e, for which your own heart condemns you? if you are not an adulterer, if you are not uncha&s;te, either in word or deed, are you not unju&s;t? the grand mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice, as well as of mercy, is, do unto others as thou would&s;t they &s;hould do unto thee.

Do you demand no more than the u&s;ual price of the goods, of any who is in pre&s;&s;ing want? who mu&s;t have, and that without delay the things which you only can furni&s;h him with? if you do, this al&s;o is flat extortion.

<P>Chri&s;tian righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds theirs, Fir&s;t, in the extent of it. Mo&s;t of the phari&s;ees,  <GAP DESC="blank">  they were rigorou&s;ly exact in many things, yet were emboldened by the traditions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ders
<PB N="155" REF="028060_0422_0FD68DD46052EED0">to di&s;pen&s;e with others of equal importance.

So that their righteou&s;ne&s;s was partial: whereas the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of a real chri&s;tian is univer&s;al. He does not ob&s;erve one, or &s;ome parts of the law of God, and neglect the re&s;t; but keeps all his com|mandments, loves them all, values them above gold or precious &s;tones.</P>
<P N="11">11. It may be indeed, that &s;ome of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, endeavoured to keep all the com|mandments, and con&s;equently were, as touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, that is, according to the letter of it, blamele&s;s. But &s;till the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of a chri&s;tian exceeds all this righteou&s;|ne&s;s of a &s;cribe or phari&s;ee, by fulfilling the &s;pi|rit as well as the letter of the law, by inward as well as outward obedience. In this, in the &s;pi|rituality of it, it admits of no compari&s;on. This is the point which our Lord has &s;o largely pro|ved, in the whole tenor of this di&s;cour&s;e. Their righteou&s;ne&s;s was external only; chri&s;tian right|eou&s;ne&s;s is in the inner man. The phari&s;ee <HI>clean|&s;ed the out&s;ide of the cup and the platter;</HI> the chri&s;tian is clean within. The phari&s;ee labour|ed to pre&s;ent God with a good life; the chri&s;|tian with a holy heart. The one &s;hook off the leaves, perhaps the fruits of &s;in; the other <HI>lays the ax to the root:</HI> as not being content with the outward form of godline&s;s, how exact &s;oe|ver it be, unle&s;s the life, the &s;pirit, the power of God unto &s;alvation, be felt in the inmo&s;t &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="028060_0423_0FD68DD6719CFD20">
Thus, to do no harm, to do good, to attend the ordinances of God (the righteou&s;ne&s;s of a phari&s;ee) are all external: whereas, on the con|trary, poverty of &s;pirit, mourning, meekne&s;s, hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, the love of our neighbour, and purity of heart (the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of a chri&s;tian) are all internal. And e|ven peace-making (or doing good) and &s;uffering for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, &s;tand intitled to the ble&s;&s;|ings annexed to them, only as they imply the&s;e inward di&s;po&s;itions, as they &s;pring from, exerci&s;e and confirm them. So that whereas the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees was external only, it may be &s;aid, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, that the right|eou&s;ne&s;s of a chri&s;tian is internal only: all his actions and &s;ufferings being as nothing in them|&s;elves, being e&s;timated before God only by the tempers from which they &s;pring.</P>

<P N="1">1. IN the preceding chapter our Lord has de|&s;cribed inward religion, in its various branch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. He has laid before us tho&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tions
<PB N="165" REF="028060_0430_0FD68DE4D80BE628">of &s;oul, which con&s;titute real chri&s;tianity: the inward tempers contained in that holine&s;s, <HI>without</HI> which <HI>no man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> Lord; the af|fections which, when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are intrin&s;ically and e&s;&s;entially good, and acceptable to God. He proceeds to &s;hew in this chapter, how all our actions likewi&s;e, even tho&s;e that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he largely declares, is of no value before God. Whereas whatever outward works are thus con&s;ecrated to God, they are in his &s;ight of great price.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nece&s;&s;ity of this purity of intention, he &s;hews fir&s;t, with regard to tho&s;e, which are u&s;u|ally accounted religious actions, and indeed are &s;uch, when performed with a right intention. Some of the&s;e are commonly termed works of piety; the re&s;t, works of charity or mercy. Of the latter &s;ort, he particularly names almigiving; of the former, prayer and fa&s;ting. But the di|rections given for the&s;e are equally to be applied to every work, whether of charity or mercy.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And fir&s;t, with regard to works of mercy. <HI>Take heed,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that ye do not your alms before men, to be &s;een of them. Otherwi&s;e ye have no reward of your Father which is in hea|ven. That ye do not your alms.</HI> Although this only is named, yet is every work of charity in|cluded, every thing which we give, or &s;peak, or
<PB N="166" REF="028060_0431_0FD68DE6501AB228">do, whereby our neighbour may be profited, whereby another man may receive any advantage, either in his body or &s;oul. The feeding the hun|gry, the cloathing the naked, the entertaining or a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;tranger, the vi&s;iting tho&s;e that are &s;ick or in pri&s;on, the comforting the afflicted; the in&s;tructing the ignorant, the reproving the wick|ed, the exhorting and encouraging the well-doer; and if there be any other work of mercy, it is equally included in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> direction.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Take heed that ye do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our alms before men, to be &s;een of them.</HI> The thing which is here for|bidden, is not, barely the doing good in the &s;ight of men: this circum&s;tance alone, that others &s;ee what we do, makes the action neither wor&s;e nor better: but the doing it before men, <HI>to be &s;een of them;</HI> with this view, from this intention only. I &s;ay, from <HI>this intention only;</HI> for this may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be a part of our intention; we may de&s;ign that &s;ome of our actions &s;hould be &s;een, and yet they may be acceptable to God. We may intend, that our <HI>light</HI> &s;hould <HI>&s;hine before men,</HI> when our con&s;cience bears us witne&s;s, in the Holy Gho&s;t, that our ultimate end in de&s;igning they &s;hould <HI>&s;ee our good works,</HI> is, <HI>that they may glorify our Father which is in heaven.</HI> But take heed that ye do not the lea&s;t thing with a view to your own glory. Take heed, that a regard to the prai&s;e of men, have no place at all in your works of mercy. If ye &s;eek your own glory, if you have any de&s;ign to gain the honour that cometh of men, whatever is done with this view is nothing worth; it is not done unto the Lord;
<PB N="167" REF="028060_0432_0FD68DEBF111A540">he accepteth it not; <HI>ye have no reward</HI> for this <HI>of your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Therefore when thou do&s;t thine alms, do not &s;ound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the &s;ynagogues and in the &s;treets, that they may have prai&s;e of men.</HI> The word <HI>&s;ynagogue</HI> does not here mean, a place of wor&s;hip, but any place of public re&s;ort, &s;uch as the market-place or exchange. It was a common thing among the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were men of large fortunes, particularly among the phari&s;ees, to cau&s;e a trumpet to be &s;ounded before them in the mo&s;t public parts of the city, when they were about to give any con&s;iderable alms. The pretended rea&s;on for this was, To call the poor together to receive it: but the real de&s;ign, that they might have prai&s;e of men. But be not thou like unto them. Do not thou cau&s;e a trumpet to be founded before thee. U&s;e no o&s;tentation in do|ing good. Aim at the honour which cometh of God only. <HI>They</HI> who &s;eek the prai&s;e of men, <HI>have their reward.</HI> They &s;hall have no prai&s;e of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But when thou doe&s;t alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</HI> This is a proverbial expre&s;&s;ion, the meaning of which is, Do it in as &s;ecret a manner as is po&s;&s;ible: as &s;ecret as is con&s;i&s;tent with the doing it at all; (for it mu&s;t not be left undone: omit no oppor|tunity of doing good, whether &s;ecretly or openly) and with the doing it in the mo&s;t effectual manner. For here is al&s;o an exception to be made. When you are fully per&s;uaded in your own mind, that by your not concealing the good which is done,
<PB N="168" REF="028060_0433_0FD68DED131B2CA0">either you will your&s;elf be enabled, or others ex|cited to do the more good, then you may not conceal it: then let your light appear, and <HI>&s;hine to all that are in the hou&s;e.</HI> But unle&s;s where the glory of God and the good of mankind oblige you to the contrary, act in as private and unob|&s;erved a manner, as the nature of the thing will admit: <HI>That thy alms may be in &s;ecret, and thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, he &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI> Perhaps in the pre&s;ent world; many in|&s;tances of this &s;tand recorded in all ages: but in|fallibly in the world to come, before the general a&s;&s;embly of men and angels.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. From works of charity or mercy, our Lord proceeds to tho&s;e which are termed works of piety. <HI>And when thou praye&s;t,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>thou &s;halt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray &s;tanding in the &s;ynagogues, and in the corners of the &s;treets, that they may be &s;een of men. Thou &s;halt not be as the hypocrites are.</HI> Hypocri&s;y then, or in&s;incerity, is the fir&s;t thing we are to guard again&s;t in prayer. Beware not to &s;peak what thou do&s;t not mean. Prayer is, the lifting up of the heart to God: all words of prayer without this are mere hypocri&s;y. Whenever therefore thou at|tempte&s;t to pray, &s;ee that it be thy one de&s;ign, to commune with God, to lift up thy heart to him, to pour out thy &s;oul before him. Not <HI>as the hypocrites,</HI> who <HI>love,</HI> or are wont, <HI>to pray &s;tanding in the &s;ynagogues,</HI> the exchange or mar|ket-places, <HI>and in the corners of the &s;treets,</HI> where|ver the mo&s;t people are, <HI>that they may be &s;een of men:</HI> this was the &s;ole de&s;ign, the motive and end, of the prayers which they there repeated.
<PB N="169" REF="028060_0434_0FD68DEE997BA2C8"><HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, they have their reward.</HI> They are to expect none from your Father which is in heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. But it is not only, the having an eye to the prai&s;e of men, which cuts us off from any re|ward in heaven; which leaves us no room to expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God, upon our works whether of piety or mercy. Purity of intention is equally de&s;troyed by a view to any temporal reward whatever. If we repeat our prayers, if we attend the public wor&s;hip of God, if we relieve the poor, with a view to gain or inte|re&s;t, it is not a whit more acceptable to God, than if it were done with a view to prai&s;e. Any temporal view, any motive whatever on this &s;ide eternity, any de&s;ign but that of promoting the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of men, for God's &s;ake, makes every action, however fair it may appear to men, an abomination unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>But when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut the door, pray to thy Fa|ther which is in &s;ecret.</HI> There is a time, when thou art openly to glorify God, to pray and prai&s;e him in the great congregation. But when thou de&s;ire&s;t more largely and more particularly to make thy reque&s;ts known unto God, whether it be in the evening or in the morning or at noon|day, <HI>enter into thy clo&s;et and &s;hut the door.</HI> U&s;e all the privacy thou can&s;t. (Only leave it not undone, whether thou ha&s;t any clo&s;et, any pri|vacy or no. Pray to God if it be po&s;&s;ible, when none &s;eeth but he: but if otherwi&s;e, pray to God.) Thus <HI>pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret;</HI> pour out all thy heart before him. <HI>And thy Fa|ther
<PB N="170" REF="028060_0435_0FD68DF01C8D5768">which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, he &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But when ye pray,</HI> even in &s;ecret, <HI>u&s;e not vain repetitions, as the heathen do.</HI> M <GAP DESC="foreign">. Do not u&s;e abundance of words without any meaning. Say not the &s;ame thing over and over again; think not the fruit of your prayers de|pends on the length of them: like the heathens; for <HI>they think they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking.</HI></P>
<P>The thing here reproved, is not &s;imply the length, no more than the &s;hortne&s;s of our pray|ers: but, fir&s;t, length without meaning; the &s;peaking much, and meaning little or nothing: the u&s;ing (not all repetitions; for our Lord him|&s;elf prayed thrice, repeating the &s;ame words; but) vain repetitions, as the heathens did, re|citing the names of their gods over and over: as they do among chri&s;tians (vulgarly &s;o called) and not among the papi&s;ts only, who &s;ay over and over the &s;ame &s;tring of prayers, without ever feeling what they &s;peak: Secondly, the thinking to be heard for our much &s;peaking, the fancying God mea&s;ures prayers by their length, and is be&s;t plea&s;ed with tho&s;e which contain the mo&s;t words, which &s;ound the longe&s;t in his ears. The&s;e are &s;uch in&s;tances of &s;uper&s;tition and &s;olly, as all who are named by the name of Chri&s;t, &s;hould leave to the heathens, to them on whom the glorious light of the go&s;pel hath never &s;hined.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Be not ye therefore like unto them.</HI> Ye who have ta&s;ted of the grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are throughly convinced, <HI>your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye a&s;k him.</HI> So that the
<PB N="171" REF="028060_0436_0FD68DF538A7B920">end of your praving, is not to inform God, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">' he knew not your wants already; but ra|ther to inform your&s;elves, to fix the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e wants more deeply in your hearts, and the &s;en&s;e of your continual dependance on him, who only is able to &s;upply all your wants. It is not &s;o much to move God, who is always more ready to give than you to a&s;k; as to move your&s;elves, that you may be willing and ready to receive the good things he has prepared for you.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. After having taught the true nature and ends of prayer, our Lord &s;ubjoins an ex|ample of it: even that divine form of prayer, which &s;eems in this place to be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ed by way of pattern chiefly, as the model <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tandard of all our prayers; <HI>after this manner therefore pray ye.</HI> Whereas el&s;ewhere he enjoins the u&s;e of the&s;e very words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 2</NOTE> <HI>He &s;aid unto them, when ye pray, &s;ay&mdash;</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We may ob&s;erve in general concerning this divine prayer. Fir&s;t, That it contains all we can rea&s;onably or innocently pray for. There is nothing which we can a&s;k without offending him, which is not included either directly or in|directly in this comprehen&s;ive form: Secondly, That it contains all we can rea&s;onably or inno|cently de&s;ire; whatever is for the glory of God, whatever is needful or pro&s;itable not only for our|&s;elves, but for every creature in heaven and earth. And indeed our prayers are the proper te&s;t of our de&s;ires; nothing being &s;it to have a place in our de&s;ires, which is not &s;it to have a
<PB N="172" REF="028060_0437_0FD68DF616017FC8">place in our prayers; what we may not pray for, neither &s;hould we de&s;ire: Thirdly, That it con|tains all our duty to God and man; what&s;oever things are pure and holy, what&s;oever God re|quires of the children of men, what&s;oever is ac|ceptable in his &s;ight, what&s;oever it is whereby we may profit our neighbour, being expre&s;&s;ed or implied therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. It con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, the preface, the petitions, and the doxology or conclu&s;ion. The preface, <HI>Our Father which art in heaven,</HI> lays a general foundation for prayer; compri&s;ing what we mu&s;t fir&s;t know of God, before we can pray, in confidence of being heard. It likewi&s;e points out to us all tho&s;e tempers, with which we are to approach to God, which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite, if we de&s;ire either our prayers or our lives &s;hould find acceptance with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>"Our Father."</HI> If he is a Father, then he is good, then he is loving to his children. And here is the fir&s;t and great rea&s;on for prayer. God is willing to ble&s;s, let us a&s;k for a ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>"Our Father,"</HI>&mdash;Our Creator; the Author of our being; he who rai&s;ed us from the du&s;t of the earth, who breathed into us the breath of life, and we became living &s;ouls. But if he made us, let us a&s;k and he will not with-hold any good thing from the work of his own hands. <HI>"Our Father"</HI>&mdash;Our pre&s;erver; who day by day &s;u&s;tains the life he has given: of who&s;e con|tinuing love, we now and every moment receive life and breath and all things.

<P N="7">7. <HI>Hallowed be thy Name.</HI> This is the fir&s;t of the &s;ix petitions, whereof the prayer it&s;elf is compo&s;ed. The name of God is God him&s;elf; the nature of God, &s;o far as it can be di&s;cover|ed to man: It means therefore, together with
<PB N="175" REF="028060_0440_0FD68DFD3779B0D0">his exi&s;tence, all his attributes or perfections&mdash;his eternity, particularly &s;ignified by his great and incommunicable name JEHOVAH, as the apo&s;tle John tran&s;lates it, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>The alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, he which is, and which was, and which is to come:</HI>&mdash;His <HI>fulne&s;s of being,</HI> denoted by his other great name, <HI>I am that I am</HI>&mdash;His omnipte&s;ence&mdash;His omnipotence; who is indeed the only agent in the material world; all matter being e&s;&s;entially dull and in|active, and moving only as it is moved by the finger of God: and he is the &s;pring of action in every creature, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible; which could neither act nor exi&s;t, without the continued in|flux and agency of his almighty power&mdash;His wi&s;dom, clearly deduced from the things that are &s;een, from the goodly order of the univer&s;e&mdash;His Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity, di&s;|covered to us in the very fir&s;t line of his written word <GAP DESC="foreign">: literally <HI>the</HI> Gods <HI>created,</HI> a plural noun joined with a verb of the &s;ingular number: as well as in every part of his &s;ub&s;e|quent revelations, given by the mouth of all his holy prophets and apo&s;tles&mdash;His e&s;&s;ential purity and holine&s;s&mdash;and above all, his love, which is the very brightne&s;s of his glory.</P>
<P>In praying that God, or his <HI>name</HI> may <HI>be hal|lowed</HI> or glorified, we pray that he may be known, &s;uch as he is, by all that are capable thereof, by all intelligent beings, and with affections &s;uita|ble to that knowledge: that he may be duly ho|noured and feared and loved by all in heaven above and in the earth beneath; by all angels and
<PB N="176" REF="028060_0441_0FD68DFE56AB7780">men, whom for that end he has made capable of knowing and loving him to eternity.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Thy kingdom come.</HI> This has a clo&s;e con|nexion with the preceding petition. In order that the name of God may be hallowed, we pray that his kingdom, the kingdom of Chri&s;t may come. This kingdom then comes to a particular per&s;on, when he <HI>repents and believes the go&s;pel:</HI> when he is taught of God, not only to know him&s;elf, but to know Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him cru|cified. As <HI>this is life eternal, to know the only true</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>whom he hath &s;ent,</HI> &s;o it is the kingdom of God begun below, &s;et up in the believer's heart: the Lord God omnipotent then reigneth, when he is known through Chri&s;t Je|&s;us. He taketh unto him&s;elf his mighty power; that he may &s;ubdue all things unto him&s;elf. He goeth on in the &s;oul conquering and to conquer, till he hath put all things under his feet, till <HI>every thought</HI> is <HI>brought into captivity to the obedience of</HI> Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When therefore God &s;hall <HI>give his &s;on the hea|then for his inheritance, and the utmo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;</HI> when <HI>all kingdoms &s;hall bow before him, and all nations &s;hall do him &s;er|vice;</HI> when <HI>the mountain of the</HI> Lord's <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> the church of <HI>Chri&s;t &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the top of the mountains;</HI> when <HI>the fulne&s;s of the gentiles &s;hall come in, and all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved:</HI> then &s;hall it be &s;een, that <HI>the</HI> Lord <HI>is king and hath put on glorious apparel</HI> appearing to every &s;oul of man, as King of kings, and Lord of lords. And it is meet for all tho&s;e who <HI>love his appear|ing,</HI> to pray that he would ha&s;ten the time: that
<PB N="177" REF="028060_0442_0FD68E006159DF50">this his kingdom, the kingdom of grace may come quickly, and &s;wallow up all the kingdoms of the earth; that all mankind receiving him for their king, truly believing in his name, may be filled with righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy, with holine&s;s and happine&s;s, till they are removed hence into his heavenly kingdom, there to reign with him for ever and ever.</P>
<P>For this al&s;o we pray in tho&s;e words, <HI>Thy kingdom come:</HI> we pray for the coming of his everla&s;ting kingdom, the kingdom of glory in heaven, which is the continuation and perfection of the kingdom of grace on earth. Con&s;e|quently this, as well as the preceding petition, is offered up for the whole intelligent creation, who are all intere&s;ted in this grand event, the &s;inal renovation of all things, by God's putting an end to mi&s;ery and &s;in, to infirmity and death, for the righteous; taking all things into his own hands, and &s;etting up the kingdom which en|dureth throughout all ages.</P>
<P>Exactly an&s;werable to this, are tho&s;e awful words, in the prayer, at the burial of the dead; "Be&s;eeching thee, that it may plea&s;e thee of thy gracious goodne&s;s, &s;hortly to accompli&s;h the num|ber of thine elect, and to ha&s;ten thy kingdom: that we with all tho&s;e that are departed, in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our per|fect con&s;ummation and bli&s;s, both in body and &s;oul, in thy everla&s;ting glory."</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</HI> This is the nece&s;&s;ary and immediate con&s;equence, wherever the kingdom of God is come: where
<PB N="178" REF="028060_0443_0FD68E016286FD40">ever God dwells in the &s;oul by faith, and Chri&s;t reigns in the heart by love.</P>
<P>It is probable, many, perhaps the generality of men, at the fir&s;t view of the&s;e words, are apt to imagine they are only an expre&s;&s;ion of, or petiti|on for re&s;ignation; for a readine&s;s to &s;uffer the will of God, what&s;oever it be concerning us. And this is unque&s;tionably a divine and excellent temper, a mo&s;t precious gift of God. But this is not what we pray for in this petition, at lea&s;t not in the chief and primary &s;en&s;e of it. We pray, not &s;o much for a pa&s;&s;ive, as for an active conformity to the will of God, in &s;aying, <HI>Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>How is it done by the angels of God in hea|ven? tho&s;e who now circle his throne rejoicing? they do it <HI>willingly;</HI> they love his command|ments, and gladly hearken to his words. It is their meat and drink to do his will; it is their highe&s;t glory and joy. They do it <HI>continually;</HI> there is no interruption in their willing &s;ervice. They re&s;t not day nor night, but employ every hour (&s;peaking after the manner of men; other|wi&s;e our mea&s;ures of duration, days and nights and hours, have no place in eternity) in fulfilling his commands, in executing his de&s;igns, in per|forming the coun&s;el of his will. And they do it <HI>perfectly.</HI> No &s;in, no defect belongs to angelic minds. It is true; <HI>the &s;tars are not pure in his &s;ight,</HI> even the morning-&s;tars that &s;ing together before him. <HI>In his &s;ight,</HI> that is in compari&s;on of him, the very angels are not pure. But this does not imply, that they are not pure <HI>in them|&s;elves.</HI> Doubtle&s;s they are; they are without
<PB N="179" REF="028060_0444_0FD68E052C03E9F0">&s;pot and blamele&s;s. They are altogether de|voted to his will, and perfectly obedient in all things.</P>
<P>If we view this in another light, we may ob|&s;erve, the angels of God in heaven, do <HI>all</HI> the will of God. And they do nothing el&s;e, nothing but what they are ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured is his will Again, they do all the will of God, <HI>as</HI> he will|eth, in the manner which plea&s;es him, and no other. Yea, and they do this, only <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it is his will; for this and no other rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="10">10. When therefore we pray, that the <HI>will of</HI> God may <HI>be done on earth as it is in heaven,</HI> the meaning is, that all the inhabitants of the earth, even the whole race of mankind, may do the will of their Father which is in heaven, as <HI>willingly</HI> as the holy angels: that the&s;e may do it <HI>continually</HI> even as they, without any interruption of their willing &s;ervice: yea, and that they may do it <HI>per|fectly;</HI> that <HI>the</HI> God <HI>of peace, through the blood of the everla&s;ting covenant, may make them perfect in every good work to do his will, and work in them all which is well-plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>In other words, we pray, that we and all man|kind, may do the whole will of God in all things: and nothing el&s;e, not the lea&s;t thing but what is the holy and acceptable will of God. We pray that we may do the whole will of God <HI>as</HI> he willeth, in the manner that plea&s;es him: and la&s;tly, that we may do it, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it is his will: that this may be the &s;ole rea&s;on and ground, the whole and only motive of what&s;oever we think, or what&s;oever we &s;peak or do.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="180" REF="028060_0445_0FD68E06963C8910">
11. <HI>Give us this day our daily bread.</HI> In the three former petitions, we have been praying for all mankind. We come now more particularly to de&s;ire a &s;upply for our own wants. Not that we are directed even here, to confine our prayer altoge|ther to our&s;elves: but this and each of the fol|lowing petitions, may be u&s;ed for the whole church of Chri&s;t upon earth.</P>
<P>By <HI>bread</HI> we may under&s;tand, all things need|ful whether for our &s;ouls or bodies; <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the things pertaining to life and god|line&s;s.</HI> We under&s;tand not barely the outward bread, what our Lord terms <HI>the meat which peri&s;h|eth;</HI> but much more the &s;piritual bread, the grace of God, the food <HI>which endureth unto everla&s;ting life.</HI> It was the judgment of many of the anci|ent fathers, that we are here to under&s;tand, the &s;acramental bread al&s;o: daily received in the be|ginning by the whole church of Chri&s;t, and high|ly e&s;teemed, till the love of many waxed cold, as the grand channel whereby the grace of his &s;pi|rit was conveyed to the &s;ouls of all the children of God.</P>
<P><HI>Our daily bread.</HI> The word we render <HI>daily</HI> has been differently explained by different com|mentators. But the mo&s;t plain and natural &s;en&s;e of it &s;eems to be this, which is retained in al|mo&s;t all tran&s;lations, as well ancient as modern: what is &s;ufficient for this day; and &s;o for each day, as it &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Give us.</HI> For we claim nothing of right, but only of free mercy. We de&s;erve not the air we breathe, the earth that bears, or the &s;un
<PB N="181" REF="028060_0446_0FD68E08117C70C0">that &s;hines upon us. All our de&s;ert, we own, is hell But God loves us freely. Therefore we a&s;k him to <HI>give,</HI> what we can no more <HI>pro|cure</HI> for our&s;elves, than we can <HI>merit</HI> it at his hands.</P>
<P>Not that either the goodne&s;s or the power of God is a rea&s;on for us to &s;tand idle. It is his will, that we &s;hould u&s;e all diligence in all things, that we &s;hould employ our utmo&s;t endeavours, as much as if our &s;ucce&s;s were the natural effect of our own wi&s;dom and &s;trength. And then, as though we had done nothing, we are to depend on him, the giver of every good and perfect gift.</P>
<P><HI>This day.</HI> For we are to take no thought for the morrow. For this very end has our wi&s;e Creator divided life into the&s;e little por|tions of time, &s;o clearly &s;eparated from each other: that we might look on every day, as a fre&s;h gift of God, another life, which we may devote to his glory; and that every evening may be as the clo&s;e of life, beyond which we are to &s;ee nothing but eternity.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>And forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us.</HI> As nothing but &s;in can hinder the bounty of God from flowing forth upon every creature, &s;o this petition na|turally follows the former; that all hinderances being removed, we may the more clearly tru&s;t in the God of love, for every manner of thing which is good.</P>
<P><HI>Our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> The word properly &s;ignifies <HI>our debts.</HI> Thus our &s;ins are frequently repre|&s;ented in &s;cripture: every &s;in laying us under a fre&s;h debt to God; to whom we already owe,
<PB N="182" REF="028060_0447_0FD68E0B1009DD90">as it were, ten thou&s;and talents. What then can we an&s;wer when he &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Pay me that thou owe&s;t?</HI> We are utterly in&s;olvent: we have nothing to pay: we have wa&s;ted all our &s;ub|&s;tance. Therefore if he deal with us according to the rigour of his law, if he exact what he ju&s;tly may, he mu&s;t command us to be <HI>bound hand and foot, and delivered over to the tormentors.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed we are already bound hand and foot, by the chains of our own &s;ins. The&s;e, con&s;i|dered with regard to our&s;elves, are chains of iron and fetters of bra&s;s. They are wounds wherewith the world, the fle&s;h and the devil, have ga&s;hed and mangled us all over. They are di&s;|ea&s;es that drink up our blood and &s;pirits, that bring us down to the chambers of the grave. But con&s;idered as they are here, with regard to God, they are debts immen&s;e and numberle&s;s. Well therefore, &s;eeing we have nothing to pay, may we cry unto him, that he would <HI>frankly forgive</HI> us all.</P>
<P>The word tran&s;lated <HI>forgive,</HI> implies either to forgive a debt, or to unloo&s;e a chain. And if we attain the former, the latter follows of cour&s;e; if our debts are forgiven, the chains fall off our hands. As &s;oon as ever, through the free grace of God in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we <HI>receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> we receive likewi&s;e <HI>a lot among tho&s;e which are &s;anctified, by faith which is in</HI> him. Sin has lo&s;t its power: it has no dominion over tho&s;e, who <HI>are under grace,</HI> that is, in favour with God. As <HI>there is now no condemnation for them that are in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;o they are freed from &s;in as well as from guilt. <HI>The righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law is fulfilled
<PB N="183" REF="028060_0448_0FD68E111F9501B8">in them,</HI> and they <HI>walk not after the fle&s;h but after the &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>As we forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us.</HI> In the&s;e words our Lord clearly declares, both on what condition, and in what degree or manner we may look to be forgiven of God. All our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins are forgiven us, <HI>if</HI> we forgive, and <HI>as</HI> we forgive others. This is a point of the utmo&s;t importance. And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord is &s;o jealous, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let it &s;lip out of our thoughts, that he not only in&s;erts it in the body of his prayer, but pre&s;ently after repeats it twice over.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>If,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Father will al&s;o forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> Secondly, God forgives us, <HI>as</HI> we forgive others. So that if any malice or bitterne&s;s, if any taint of unkindne&s;s or anger remains, if we do not clear|ly fully, and from the heart, forgive all men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, we &s;o far cut &s;hort the forgive|ne&s;s of our own. God cannot clearly and fully forgive us. He may &s;hew us &s;ome degree of mercy. But we will not &s;uffer him to blot out all our &s;ins, and forgive all our iniquities.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while we do not from our hearts, forgive our neighbour his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, what manner of prayer are we offering to God, when|ever we utter the&s;e words? we are indeed &s;et|ting God at open defiance: we are daring him to do his wor&s;t. Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we
<PB N="184" REF="028060_0449_0FD68E129E4D9950">forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us! that is in plain terms, "Do not thou forgive us at all: we de&s;ire no favour at thy hands. We pray, that thou wilt keep our &s;ins in remembrance, and that thy wrath may abide upon us." But can you &s;e|riou&s;ly offer &s;uch a prayer to God? and hath he not yet ca&s;t you quick into hell? O tempt him no longer! now, even now, by his grace, forgive as you would be forgiven! now have compa&s;&s;ion on thy fellow-&s;ervant, as God hath had and will have pity on thee.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Lead us not into temptation.</HI> The word tran&s;lated <HI>temptation,</HI> means trial of any kind. And &s;o the Engli&s;h word temptation was formerly taken, in an indifferent &s;en&s;e: although now it is u&s;ually under&s;tood, of &s;olicitation to &s;in. St. <HI>James</HI> u&s;es the word in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es; fir&s;t, in its general, then in its re&s;trained ac|ceptation. He takes it in the former &s;en&s;e when he &s;aith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. Ver. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that endureth tempt|ation; for when he is tried,</HI> or approved of God, <HI>he &s;hall receive the crown of life.</HI> He immedi|ately adds, taking the word in the latter &s;en&s;e, <HI>let no man &s;ay when he is tempted, I am tempted of</HI> God: <HI>for</HI> God <HI>cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t,</HI> or de&s;ire, <GAP DESC="foreign">, drawn out of God, in whom alone he is &s;afe, <HI>and enticed,</HI> caught as a fi&s;h with a bait. Then it is, when he is thus <HI>drawn away and en|ticed,</HI> that he properly <HI>enters into temptation.</HI> The temptation covers him as a cloud: it over&s;preads
<PB N="185" REF="028060_0450_0FD68E1668C21500">his whole &s;oul. Then how hardly &s;hall he e&s;cape out of the &s;nare? therefore we be&s;eech. God, <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to lead us into temptation,</HI> that is (&s;eeing God <HI>tempt|eth no man</HI>) not to &s;uffer us to be led into it. <HI>But deliver us from evil:</HI> Rather, <HI>from the evil one;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. 'O <GAP DESC="foreign"> is unque&s;tionably <HI>the wicked one,</HI> emphatically &s;o called, the prince and god of this world, who works with mighty power in the children of di&s;obedience. But all tho&s;e who are the children of God by faith, are delivered out of his hands. He may fight again&s;t them: and &s;o he will. But he cannot conquer, unle&s;s they betray their own &s;ouls. He may tor|ment for a time; but he cannot de&s;troy; for God is on their &s;ide, who will not fail in the end, to <HI>avenge his own elect, that cry unto him day and night,</HI> "Lord, when we are tempted, &s;uffer us not to enter into temptation. Do thou make a way for us to e&s;cape, that the wicked one touch us not."</P>
<P N="16">16. The conclu&s;ion of this divine prayer, com|monly called the doxology, is a &s;olemn thank&s;|giving, a compendious acknowledgment of the attributes and works of God. <HI>For thine is the kingdom;</HI> the &s;overeign right of all things that are, or ever were created: yea, thy kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and thy dominion en|dureth throughout all ages. <HI>The power:</HI> the ex|ecutive power, whereby thou governe&s;t all things in thy everla&s;ting kingdom, whereby thou do&s;t what&s;oever plea&s;eth thee, in all places of thy do|minion.&mdash;<HI>And the glory;</HI> the prai&s;e due from eve|ry creature, for thy power and the mightine&s;s of

<P>Moreover, when ye fa&s;t, be not as the Hypocrites, of a &s;ad Countenance, for they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fa&s;t. Verily I &s;ay unto you, they have their Reward.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IT has been the endeavour of Satan from the beginning of the world, to put a&s;under what God had joined together; to &s;eparate in|ward from outward religion, to &s;et one of the&s;e at variance with the other. And herein he has met with no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, among tho&s;e who were <HI>ignorant of his devices.</HI></P>
<P>Many in all ages, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, have been &s;trictly at|tached to the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law,</HI> the perform|ance of outward duties, but in the mean time wholly regardle&s;s of inward righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of</HI> God <HI>by faith.</HI> And many
<PB N="194" REF="028060_0457_0FD68E272F0AF418">have run into the oppo&s;ite extreme, di&s;regarding all outward duties, perhaps even <HI>&s;peaking evil of the law and judging the law,</HI> &s;o far as it enjoins the performance of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is by this very device of Satan, that faith and works have been &s;o often &s;et at variance with each other. And many who had a real zeal for God, have for a time fallen into the &s;nare on ei|ther hand. Some have magnified faith to the ut|ter exclu&s;ion of good works, not only from be|ing the cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification (for we know that man is <HI>ju&s;tified freely by the redemption which is in</HI> Je&s;us) but from being the nece&s;&s;ary fruit of it, yea, from having any place in the religion of <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Others, eager to avoid this dangerous mi&s;take, have run as much too far the contrary way; and either maintained, That good works were the cau&s;e, at lea&s;t the previous condition of ju&s;tification; or &s;poken of them as if they were all in all, the whole religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In the &s;ame manner have the end and the means of religion, been &s;et at variance with each other. Some well-meaning men, have &s;eemed to place all religion, in attending the prayers of the church, in receiving the Lord's &s;upper, in hear|ing &s;ermons, and reading books of piety: ne|glecting mean-time the end of all the&s;e, the love of God and their neighbour. And this very thing has confirmed others in the neglect, if not contempt of the ordinances of God; &s;o wretchedly abu&s;ed to undermine and overthrow the very end they were de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P N="4">4. But of all the means of grace there is &s;carce any, concerning which men have run
<PB N="195" REF="028060_0458_0FD68E295EC624B0">into greater extremes, than that of which our Lord &s;peaks in the above-mentioned words, I mean, religious fa&s;ting. How have &s;ome exalted this beyond all &s;cripture and rea&s;on? and others utterly di&s;regarded it? as it were, revenging them&s;elves, by undervaluing, as much as the former had overvalued it. Tho&s;e have &s;poken of it, as if it were all in all; if not the end it&s;elf, yet infallibly connected with it: the&s;e, as if it were ju&s;t nothing, as if it were a fruitle&s;s labour, which had no relation at all thereto. Whereas it is certain the truth lies between them both. It is not all; nor yet is it nothing. It is not the end, but it is a precious means thereto; a means which God him&s;elf has ordained; and in which therefore, when it is duly u&s;ed, he will &s;urely give us his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In order to &s;et this in the cleare&s;t light, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, Fir&s;t, what is the nature of fa&s;ting, and what the &s;everal &s;orts and degrees thereof: Secondly, what are the rea&s;ons, grounds and ends of it: Thirdly, how we may an&s;wer the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objections again&s;t it: and Fourthly, in what manner it &s;hould be performed.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, Fir&s;t, what is the nature of fa&s;ting, and what the &s;everal &s;orts and degrees thereof. As to the nature of it, all the in&s;pired writers, both in the Old Te&s;ta|ment and the New, take the word, to fa&s;t, in one &s;ingle &s;en&s;e, for not to eat, to ab&s;tain from food. This is &s;o clear, that it would be labour lo&s;t to quote the words of <HI>David, Nehemiah, I&s;aiah,</HI> and the prophets which followed, or of
<PB N="196" REF="028060_0459_0FD68E2A99AC5B70">our Lord and his apo&s;tles; all agreeing in this, that, to fa&s;t, is not to eat for a time pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P N="2">2. To this other circum&s;tances were u&s;ually joined by them of old, which had no nece&s;&s;ary connexion with it. Such were the neglect of their apparel, the laying a&s;ide tho&s;e ornaments which they were accu&s;tomed to wear: the put|ting on mourning, the &s;trewing a&s;hes upon their head, or wearing &s;ackcloth next their &s;kin. But we find little mention made in the new te&s;ta|ment, of any of the&s;e indifferent circum&s;tances. Nor does it appear that any &s;tre&s;s was laid upon them, by the chri&s;tians of the purer ages; how|ever &s;ome penitents might voluntarily u&s;e them, as outward &s;igns of inward humiliation. Much le&s;s did the apo&s;tles or the chri&s;tians cotemporary with them, beat or tear their own fle&s;h. Such <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> as this was not unbecoming the prie&s;ts or wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal.</HI> The gods of the hea|thens were but devils; and it was doubtle&s;s ac|ceptable to their devil-god, when his prie&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xviii. 28.</NOTE> <HI>cried aloud, and cut them&s;elves after this manner, till the blood gu&s;hed out upon them:</HI> but it cannot be plea&s;ing to Him, nor become his followers, who <HI>came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to the degrees or mea&s;ures of fa&s;ting, we have in&s;tances of &s;ome who have fa&s;ted &s;eve|ral days together. So Mo&s;es, Elijah and our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, being indued with &s;upernatural &s;trength for that purpo&s;e, are recorded to have fa&s;ted without intermi&s;&s;ion, <HI>forty days and forty nights.</HI> But the time of fa&s;ting more frequently mentioned in &s;cripture, is, one day, from morn|ing
<PB N="197" REF="028060_0460_0FD68E2C153ED7C0">till evening. And this was the fa&s;t commonly ob&s;erved among the ancient chri&s;tians. But be|&s;ide the&s;e, they had al&s;o their half-fa&s;ts (<HI>&s;emije|junia,</HI> as <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;tiles them) on the fourth and &s;ixth days of the week (Wedne&s;day and Friday) throughout the year: on which they took no &s;u&s;tenance till three in the afternoon, the time when they returned from the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nearly related to this, is what our church &s;eems peculiarly to mean by the term <HI>ab&s;tinence:</HI> which may be u&s;ed when we cannot fa&s;t entirely by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s or hodily weakne&s;s. This is, the eating little; the ab&s;taining in part; the taking a &s;maller quantity of food than u&s;ual. I do not remember any &s;criptural in&s;tance of this. But neither can I condemn it. For the &s;cripture does not: it may have its u&s;e, and receive a ble&s;&s;ing from God.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lowe&s;t kind of fa&s;ting, if it can be called by that name, is the ab&s;taining from plea|&s;ant food. Of this we have &s;everal in&s;tances in &s;cripture be&s;ides that of Daniel and his brethren: who from a peculiar con&s;ideration, namely, that they might<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan, iv. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>not defile them&s;elves with the portion of the kings meat,</HI> nor <HI>with the wine which he drank</HI> (<HI>a daily provi&s;ion</HI> of which <HI>the king had ap|pointed for them</HI>) <HI>reque&s;ted</HI> and obtained of <HI>the prince of the eunuchs, pul&s;e to eat and water to drink.</HI> Perhaps from a mi&s;taken imitation of this, might &s;pring the very ancient cu&s;tom, of ab&s;taining from fle&s;h and wine during &s;uch times as were &s;et a-part for fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence. If it did not rather ari&s;e from a &s;uppo&s;ition that
<PB N="198" REF="028060_0461_0FD68E2DA9723EA8">the&s;e were the mo&s;t plea&s;ant food, and a belief, that it was proper to u&s;e what was lea&s;t plea&s;ing, at tho&s;e times of &s;olemn approach to God.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the Jewi&s;h church, there were &s;ome &s;tated fa&s;ts. Such was the fa&s;t of the &s;eventh month, appointed by God him&s;elf, to be ob&s;erved by all I&s;rael, under the &s;evere&s;t penalty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxiii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The</HI> Lord <HI>&s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying, On the tenth day of the &s;eventh month, there &s;hall be a day of atone|ment; and ye &s;hall afflict your &s;ouls&mdash;to make an atonement for you before the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God. <HI>For what&s;oever &s;oul it be that &s;hall not be afflicted in that &s;ame day he &s;hall be cut off from among his people.</HI> In after ages &s;everal other &s;tated fa&s;ts were added to the&s;e. So mention is made by the prophet Zechariah, of the fa&s;t, not only<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zech. viii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>of the &s;eventh,</HI> but al&s;o of <HI>the &s;ourth, of the fifth, and of the tenth month.</HI></P>
<P>In the ancient chri&s;tian church there were like|wi&s;e &s;tated fa&s;ts, and tho&s;e both annual and week|ly. Of the former &s;ort was that before Ea&s;ter; ob&s;erved by &s;ome for eight and forty hours: by others, for an entire week; by many for two weeks, taking no &s;u&s;tenance till the evening of each day. Of the latter, tho&s;e of the fourth and &s;ixth days of the week, ob&s;erved (as Epipha|nius writes, remarking it as an undeniable fact) <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>in the whole habitable earth,</HI> at lea&s;t, in every place where any chri&s;tians made their abode. The annual fa&s;ts in our church are, "The forty days of lent, the ember days at the four &s;ea&s;ons, the rogation days, and the vigils or
<PB N="199" REF="028060_0462_0FD68E33B91C48F8">eves of &s;everal &s;olemn fe&s;tivals: the weekly, all Fridays in the year, except Chri&s;tmas-day.</P>
<P>But be&s;ide tho&s;e which were fixed, in every na|tion fearing God, there have always been occa|&s;ional fa&s;ts, appointed from time to time, as the particular circum&s;tances and occa&s;ions of each required. So<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xx. 1, 3.</NOTE> when <HI>the children of Moah and the children of Ammon, came again&s;t Jeho&s;haphat to battle; Jeho&s;haphat &s;et him&s;elf to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eh the</HI> Lord, <HI>and proclaimed a fa&s;t throughout all Judah.</HI> And &s;o<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxvi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the &s;on of Jo|&s;iah, in the ninth month,</HI> when they were afraid of the king of Babylon, the princes of Judah <HI>pro|claimed a fa&s;t before the</HI> Lord, <HI>to all the people of Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>And in like manner, particular per&s;ons, who take heed unto their ways, and de&s;ire to walk humbly and clo&s;ely with God, will find frequent occa&s;ion for private &s;ea&s;ons of thus afflicting their &s;ouls, before their Father which is in &s;ecret. And it is to this kind of fa&s;ting, that the direc|tions here given, do chiefly and primarily refer.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. I proceed, to &s;hew, in the &s;econd place, what are the grounds, the rea&s;ons and ends of fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, men who are under &s;trong emoti|ons of mind, who are affected with any vehe|ment pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as &s;orrow or fear, are often &s;wallowed up therein, and even <HI>forget to eat their bread.</HI> At &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons they have little regard for food, not even what is needful to &s;u&s;tain na|ture; much le&s;s for any delicacy or variety, be|ing
<PB N="200" REF="028060_0463_0FD68E51365DEC48">taken up with quite different thoughts. Thus when<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xxv&s;ii. 15, 20.</NOTE> Saul &s;aid, <HI>I am &s;ore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for the Phi|li&s;tines make was again&s;t me, and</HI> God <HI>is departed from me;</HI> it is recorded, <HI>he had eaten no bread, all the day nor all the night.</HI> Thus tho&s;e who were in the &s;hip with St. Paul, <HI>when no &s;mall tempe&s;t lay upon them,</HI> and all <HI>hope that they &s;hould be &s;aved was taken away,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvii. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>continued fa&s;ting, hav|ing taken nothin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> no regular meal, for fourteen days together. And thus <HI>David and all the men that were with him,</HI> when they heard that <HI>the peo|ple were fled from the battle, and that many of the people were fallen and dead, and</HI> Saul <HI>and</HI> Jonathan <HI>his &s;on were dead al&s;o;</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">12.</NOTE> <HI>mourned and wept and fa&s;ted until even for</HI> Saul <HI>and</HI> Jonathan, <HI>and for the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael.</P>
<P>Nay, many times they who&s;e minds are deeply engaged, and impatient of any interruption, and even loath their needful food, as diverting their thoughts, from what they de&s;ire &s;hould engro&s;s their whole attention. Even as Saul, when on the occa&s;ion mentioned before, he had <HI>fallen all along upon the earth and there was no &s;trength in him,</HI> yet <HI>&s;aid, I will not eat,</HI> till <HI>his &s;ervants, together with the woman compelled him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here then is the natural ground of fa&s;ting. One who is under deep affliction, overwhelmed with &s;orrow for &s;in, and a &s;trong apprehen&s;ion of the wrath of God, would without any rule, without knowing or con&s;idering, whether it were a command of God or not, <HI>forget to eat his bread,</HI> ab&s;tain not only from plea&s;ant, but even from needful food. Like St. Paul, who after he was
<PB N="201" REF="028060_0464_0FD6288AF56FCB58"><HI>led into</HI> Dama&s;cus, <HI>was three days without &s;ight, and neither did eat nor drink,</HI> Acts ix. 9.</P>
<P>Yea, when the &s;torm ro&s;e high, when <HI>an hor|rible dread overwhelmed</HI> one who had long been without God in the world; his &s;oul would <HI>loath all manner of meat;</HI> it would be unplea&s;ing and irk|&s;ome to him. He would be impatient of any thing that &s;hould interrupt his cea&s;ele&s;s cry, Lord, <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve! or I peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;trongly is this expre&s;&s;ed by our church, in the fir&s;t part of the homily on fa&s;ting?</P>
<P>"When men feel in them&s;elves the heavy burthen of &s;in, &s;ee damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell; they tremble, they quake, and are inwardly touched with &s;orrowfulne&s;s of heart, and cannot but accu&s;e them&s;elves and open their grief unto almighty God, and call unto him for mercy. This being done &s;eriou&s;ly, their mind is &s;o occupied (taken up) partly with &s;orrow and heavine&s;s, partly with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be deli|vered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all de&s;ire of meat and drink is laid apart, and loath&s;omene&s;s (or loathing) of all worldly things and plea&s;ure cometh in place. So that nothing then liketh them more than to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour of body to &s;how them&s;elves weary of life."</P>
<P N="3">3. Another rea&s;on or ground of fa&s;ting is this. Many of tho&s;e who now fear God, are deeply &s;en&s;ible how often they have &s;inned again&s;t him, by the abu&s;e of the&s;e lawful things. They know, how much they have &s;inned by exce&s;s of food; how long they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the holy law of
<PB N="202" REF="028060_0465_0FD62897E03671D8">God, with regard to temperance, if not &s;obriety too: how they have indulged their &s;en&s;ual appe|tites, perhaps to the impairing even their bodily health; certainly to the no &s;mall hurt of their &s;oul. For hereby they continually fed and in|crea&s;ed that &s;prightly folly, that airine&s;s of mind, that levity of temper, that gay inattention to things of the deepe&s;t concern, that giddine&s;s and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;pirit, which were no other than drunkenne&s;s of &s;oul, which &s;tupified all their no|ble&s;t faculties, no le&s;s than exce&s;s of wine or &s;trong drink. To remove therefore the effect, they remove the cau&s;e: They keep at a di&s;tance from all exce&s;s. They ab&s;tain, as far as is po&s;&s;i|ble, from what had well nigh plunged them in everla&s;ting perdition. They often wholly refrain; always take care to be &s;paring and temperate in all things.</P>
<P N="4">4. They likewi&s;e well remember, how fulne&s;s of bread, increa&s;ed not only carele&s;&s;e&s;s and le|nity of &s;pirit, but al&s;o fooli&s;h and unholy de&s;ires, yea, unclean and vile affections. And this expe|rience puts beyond all doubt. Even a genteel; regular &s;en&s;uality, is continually &s;en&s;ualizing the &s;oul, and &s;inking it into a level with the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. It cannot be expre&s;&s;ed what an ef|fect variety and delicacy of food have on the mind as well as the body; making it ju&s;t ripe for every plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e, as &s;oon as opportunity &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in|vite. Therefore on this ground al&s;o e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y wi&s;e man will refrain his foul, and keep it low; will wean it more and more from all tho&s;e indulgences of the inferior appetites, which naturally tend to chain it down to earth, and to pollute as well as deba&s;e it. Here is another perpetual rea&s;on for
<PB N="203" REF="028060_0466_0FD68E35D5CE2358">fa&s;ting: to remove the food of lu&s;t and &s;en&s;uality, to withdraw the incentives of fooli&s;h and hurtful de&s;ires, of vile and vain affections.</P>
<P N="5">5. Perhaps we need not altogether omit (altho' I know not if we &s;hould do well, to lay any great &s;tre&s;s upon it) another rea&s;on for fa&s;ting, which &s;ome good men have largely in&s;i&s;ted on: namely, the puni&s;hing them&s;elves for having abu&s;ed the good gifts of God, by &s;ometimes wholly refraining from them: thus exerci&s;ing a kind of holy revenge upon them&s;elves, for their pa&s;t folly and ingratitude, in turning the things which &s;hould have been for their health, into an occa&s;ion of falling. They &s;uppo&s;e <HI>David</HI> to have had an eye to this when he &s;aid, <HI>I wept and cha&s;|tened,</HI> or puni&s;hed <HI>my &s;oul with fa&s;ting:</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he mentions <HI>what revenge</HI> godly &s;or|row occa&s;ioned in the <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. A fifth, and more weighty rea&s;on for fa&s;t|ing, is, That it is an help to prayer: par|ticularly, when we &s;et apart larger portions of time for private prayer. Then e&s;pecially it is, that God is often plea&s;ed to lift up the &s;ouls of his &s;ervants above all the things of earth, and &s;ometimes to wrap them up, as it were, into the third heavens. And it is chiefly, as it is an help to prayer, that it has &s;o frequently been found a means in the hand of God, of con|firming and increa&s;ing not one virtue, not cha&s;|tity only (as &s;ome have idly imagined, without any ground, either from &s;cripture, rea&s;on or experience) but al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of &s;pirit, ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, &s;en&s;ibility, and tenderne&s;s of con&s;ci|ence; deadne&s;s to the world, and con&s;equently
<PB N="204" REF="028060_0467_0FD68E36F9294530">the love of God and every holy and heavenly affection.</P>
<P N="7">7. Not that there is any natural or nece&s;&s;ary connexion, between fa&s;ting, and the ble&s;&s;ings God conveys thereby. But he will have mercy <HI>as</HI> he will have mercy: he will convey what&s;oever &s;eemeth him good, by what&s;oever means he is plea&s;ed to appoint.

<P>How powerful a means this is, to avert the wrath of God, we may learn from the remarka|ble in&s;tance of <HI>Ahab.

<P>It was for this end, to avert the wrath of God, that <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;ought God, <HI>with fa&s;ting and &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes.</HI> This appears from the whole tenor of his prayer, particularly from the &s;olemn conclu&s;i|on of it. <HI>O</HI> Lord, <HI>according to all thy righteou&s;ne&s;s|es</HI> (or mercies) <HI>let thy anger be turned away from thy holy mountain&mdash;Hear the prayer of thy &s;ervant, and cau&s;e thy face to &s;hine upon thy &s;anctuary that is de&s;olate.&mdash;O</HI> Lord, <HI>hear!

<P N="8">8. But it is not only from the people of God that we learn, when his anger is moved, to &s;eek
<PB N="205" REF="028060_0468_0FD68E3817AADE50">him by fa&s;ting and prayer; but even from the heathens.

<P N="10">10. In like manner, the apo&s;tles always joined fa&s;ting with prayer, when they de&s;ired the ble&s;&s;|ing of God on any important undertaking.

<P>Yea, that ble&s;&s;ings are to be obtained in the u&s;e of this means, which are no otherwi&s;e at|tainable, our Lord expre&s;sly declares in his an|&s;wer to his di&s;ciples, a&s;king,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xvii. 19, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Why could not we ca&s;t him out?

<P N="11">11. The&s;e were the appointed means.

But they have been from time to time taught it of God him&s;elf, by clear and open revelations of his will. Such is that remarkable one by the prophet Joel,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 12, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>Therefore thus &s;aith the Lord, turn you un|to me, with all your heart, and with fa&s;ting, and with weeping, and with mourning&mdash;Who knoweth if the Lord will return and repent, and leave a ble&s;&s;ing behind him? blow the trumpet in Zion, &s;anctify a fa&s;t, call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly&mdash;Then will the Lord be jealous over his land, and will &s;pare his people.

Nor are they only temporal ble&s;&s;ings which God directs his people to expect in the u&s;e of the&s;e means. For at the &s;ame time that he promi&s;ed to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;eek him with fa&s;ting, and weeping, and mourning, <HI>I will render you the ears which the gra&s;hopper hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar and the palmer-worm, my great army,</HI> he &s;ubjoins, <HI>&s;o &s;hall ye eat and be &s;atisfied, and prai&s;e the name of the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God&mdash;<HI>Ye &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w that I am in the mid&s;t of I&s;rael, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the</HI> Lord <HI>your</HI> God.

<P N="12">12. Now what&s;oever rea&s;ons there were to quicken tho&s;e of old in the zealous and con&s;tant di&s;charge of this duty, they are of equal force &s;till to quicken us. But above all the&s;e we have a peculiar rea&s;on for being in fa&s;tings often, namely, the command of him by who&s;e name we are called. He does not indeed in this place ex|pre&s;sly enjoin, either fa&s;ting, giving of alms or prayer. But his directions how to fa&s;t, to give alms, and to pray, are of the &s;ame force with &s;uch injunctions. For the commanding us, to do any thing <HI>that,</HI> is an unque&s;tionable com|mand, to do that thing; &s;eeing it is impo&s;&s;ible to perform it thus, if it be not performed at all. Con&s;equently, the &s;aying, give alms, pray, fa&s;t in &s;uch a manner, is a clear command to per|form
<PB N="209" REF="028060_0472_0FD68E3FB14F7190">all tho&s;e duties: as well as to perform them in that manner, which &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e its reward.</P>
<P>And this is a &s;till farther motive and encou|ragement, to the performance of this duty; even the promi&s;e which our Lord has graciou&s;ly an|nexed to the due di&s;charge of it: <HI>Thy Father, which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI> Such are the plain grounds, rea&s;ons and ends of fa&s;t|ing; &s;uch our encouragement to per&s;evere there|in, notwith&s;tanding abundance of objections which men, wi&s;er than their Lord, have been continually rai&s;ing again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible of the&s;e I come now to con&s;ider. And, Fir&s;t, It has been frequently &s;aid, "Let a chri&s;tian fa&s;t from &s;in, and not from food: this is what God requires at his hands." So he does: but he requires the other al&s;o. Therefore this ought to be done, and that not left undone.</P>
<P>View your argument in its full dimen&s;ions; and your will ea&s;ily judge of the &s;trength of it.</P>
<P>"If a chri&s;tian ought to ab&s;tain from &s;in, then he ought not to ab&s;tain from food:</P>
<P>But a chri&s;tian ought to ab&s;tain from &s;in:</P>
<P>Therefore he ought not to ab&s;tain from food."</P>
<P>That a chri&s;tian ought to ab&s;tain from &s;in, is mo&s;t true. But does it follow from hence, that he ought not to ab&s;tain from food? Yea, let him do both the one and the other. Let him, by the grace of God, always ab&s;tain from &s;in; and let him often ab&s;tain from food; for &s;uch rea&s;ons and
<PB N="210" REF="028060_0473_0FD68E41148426C8">ends as experience and &s;cripture plainly &s;hew to be an&s;wered thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. "But is it not better (as it has, Secondly, been objected) to ab&s;tain from pride and vanity, from fooli&s;h and hurtful de&s;ires, from peevi&s;hne&s;s, and anger, and di&s;content, than from food?" Without que&s;tion it is. But here again we have need to remind you of our Lord's words, <HI>the&s;e things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI> And indeed the latter is only in order to the former; it is a means to that great end. We ab&s;tain from food with this view, that by the grace of God, conveyed into our &s;ouls, through this outward means, in conjunction with all the other channels of his grace which he hath appointed, we may be enabled to ab&s;tain from eve|ry pa&s;&s;ion and temper, which is not plea&s;ing in his &s;ight. We refrain from the one, that being en|dued with power from on high, we may be able to refrain from the other, &s;o that your argument proves ju&s;t the contrary to what you de&s;igned. It proves, that we ought to fa&s;t. For if we ought to ab&s;tain from evil tempers and de&s;ires, then we ought thus to ab&s;tain from food: &s;ince the&s;e little in&s;tances of &s;elf-denial are the ways God hath cho&s;e, wherein to be&s;tow that great &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. "But we do not find it &s;o in fact: (this is a third objection.) We have fa&s;ted much and often. But what did it avail? we were not a whit better: we found no ble&s;&s;ing therein. Nay, we have found it an hinderance rather than an help. In&s;tead of preventing anger, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="211" REF="028060_0474_0FD68E429ECAEF40">or fretfulne&s;s, it has been a means of increa&s;ing them to &s;uch a height, that we could neither bear others nor our&s;elves." This may very po&s;&s;ibly be the ca&s;e. It is po&s;&s;ible, either to fa&s;t or pray, in &s;uch a manner, as to make you much wor&s;e than before; more unhappy, and more unholy. Yet the fault does not lie in the means it&s;elf; but in the manner of u&s;ing it. U&s;e it &s;till, but u&s;e it in a different manner. Do what God commands as he commands it, and then doubtle&s;s his promi&s;e &s;hall not fail; his ble&s;&s;ing &s;hall be with-held no longer: but <HI>when thou fa&s;te&s;t in &s;ecret, he that &s;eeth in &s;ecret &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "But is it not mere &s;uper&s;tition (&s;o it has been, Fourthly, objected) to imagine that God regards &s;uch little things as the&s;e?" if you &s;ay it is, you condemn all the generation of God's children. But will you &s;ay, the&s;e were all weak, &s;uper&s;titious men? can you be &s;o hardy as to af|firm this, both of Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua, of Samuel and David, of Jeho&s;haphat, Ezra, Nehemiah, and all the prophets? Yea, of a greater than all, the Son of God him&s;elf? it is certain, both our Ma&s;ter, and all the&s;e his &s;ervants, did imagine, that fa&s;ting is not a little thing, and that he who is higher than the highe&s;t doth regard it. Of the &s;ame judgment, it is plain, were all the apo&s;tles, after they were <HI>filled with the Holy Gho&s;t and with wi&s;dom.</HI> When they had <HI>the unction of the Holy One, teaching</HI> them <HI>all things,</HI> they &s;till <HI>approved them&s;elves the mini&s;ters of</HI> God, <HI>by fa&s;tings,</HI> as well as <HI>by the armour of righteou&s;ne&s;s on the right hand, and on the left.</HI> After <HI>the Bridegroom was
<PB N="212" REF="028060_0475_0FD68E441444F700">taken from them, then did they fa&s;t in tho&s;e days.</HI> Nor would they attempt any thing (as we have &s;een above) wherein the glory of God was near|ly concerned, &s;uch as the &s;ending forth labourers into the harve&s;t, without &s;olemn fa&s;ting as well as prayer.</P>
<P N="5">5. "But if fa&s;ting be indeed of &s;o great im|portance, and attended with &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, is it not be&s;t, &s;ay &s;ome, Fifthly, to fa&s;t always? not to do it now and then, but to keep a continual fa&s;t? to u&s;e as much ab&s;tinence at all times, as our bodily &s;trength will bear?" let none be di&s;|couraged from doing this. By all means u&s;e as little and plain food, exerci&s;e as much &s;elf-denial herein at all times, as your bodily &s;trength will bear. And this may conduce, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to &s;everal of the great ends above-menti|oned. It may be a con&s;iderable help not only to cha&s;tity, but al&s;o to heavenly-mindedne&s;s; to the weaning your affections from things below, and &s;etting them on things above. But this is not fa&s;ting, &s;criptural fa&s;ting: it is never termed &s;o in all the Bible. It in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wers &s;ome of the ends hereof but &s;till it is another thing. Practi&s;e it by all means; but not &s;o as thereby to &s;et a&s;ide a command of God, and an in&s;tituted means of averting his judgment, and obtaining the ble&s;&s;ings of his children.</P>
<P N="6">6. U&s;e continually then as much ab&s;tinence as you plea&s;e; which taken thus, is no other than chri&s;tian temperance. But this need not at all interfere with your ob&s;erving &s;olemn times of fa&s;ting and prayer. For in&s;tance; your habitual
<PB N="213" REF="028060_0476_0FD68E4832DB2658">ab&s;tinence or temperance, would not prevent your fa&s;ting in &s;ecret, if you was &s;uddenly over|whelmed with huge &s;orrow and remor&s;e, and with horrible fear and di&s;may. Such a &s;ituation of mind would almo&s;t con&s;train you to fa&s;t: you would loath your dainty food: you would &s;carce endure even to take &s;uch &s;upplies, as were need|ful for the body, till God lifted-you up-<HI>out of the horrible pit, and &s;et your feet upon a rock, and or|dered your goings.</HI> The &s;ame would be the ca&s;e if you was in agony of de&s;ire vehemently wre&s;tling with God for his ble&s;&s;ing. You would need none to in&s;truct you, not to eat bread, till you had ob|tained the reque&s;t of your lips.</P>
<P N="7">7. Again had you been at Nineveh, when it was proclaimed throughout the city, <HI>Let neither man nor bea&s;t, herd nor flock ta&s;te any thing: let them not feed or drink water, but let them cry might|ily unto</HI> God: would your continual fa&s;t have been any rea&s;on for not bearing part in that general humiliation? doubtle&s;s it would not. You would have been as much concerned as any other, not to ta&s;te food on that day.</P>
<P>No more would ab&s;tinence, or the ob&s;erving a continual fa&s;t, have excu&s;ed any of the children of I&s;rael, from fa&s;ting on the tenth day of the &s;eventh month, the great annual day of atone|ment. There was no exception for the&s;e in that &s;olemn decree, <HI>What&s;oever &s;oul it &s;hall be, that &s;hall not be afflicted</HI> (&s;hall not fa&s;t) <HI>in that day, he &s;hall be cut off from among his people.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, had you been with the brethren in An|tioch at the time when they fa&s;ted and prayed,

<P N="4">IV. 1. I am, in the la&s;t place, to &s;hew, in what manner we are to fa&s;t, that it may be an acceptable &s;ervice unto the Lord. And, fir&s;t, Let it be done <HI>unto the</HI> Lord with our eye &s;ingly fixed on him.

<P>Let us beware of mocking God, of turning our fa&s;t as well as our prayer into an abomination unto the Lord, by the mixture of any temporal view, particularly, by &s;eeking the prai&s;e of men. A|gain&s;t this our ble&s;&s;ed Lord more peculiarly guards us, in the words of the text. <HI>Moreover, when ye fa&s;t, be ye not as the hypocrites</HI> (&s;uch were too many who were called the people of God) <HI>of a &s;ad countenance;</HI> four, affectedly &s;ad, putting their looks into a peculiar form. <HI>For they di&s;|figure

<P N="2">2. But if we de&s;ire this reward, let us be|ware, Secondly, of fancying we <HI>merit</HI> any thing of God by our fa&s;ting.

<P N="3">3. Not that we are to imagine, the perform|ing the bare outward act, will receive any ble&s;|&s;ing from God. <HI>Is it &s;uch a fa&s;t that I have cho|&s;en, &s;aith the</HI> Lord: <HI>a day for a man to afflict his &s;oul? is it to &s;pread &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes under him?</HI> are the&s;e outward acts, however &s;trictly per|formed, all that is meant by a man's <HI>afflicting his &s;oul?

<P N="4">4. Yea, the body may &s;ometimes be afflicted too much, &s;o as to be un&s;it for the works of our calling.

<P>But at the&s;e &s;olemn &s;ea&s;ons, we may even in great weakne&s;s of body, avoid that other ex|treme, for which God condemns tho&s;e who of old expo&s;tulated with him for not accepting their fa&s;ts. <HI>Wherefore have we fa&s;ted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;ee&s;t not?&mdash;Behold in the day of your fa&s;t you find plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;aith the Lord&mdash;If we cannot wholly ab&s;tain, we may at lea&s;t ab&s;tain from plea|&s;ant food; and then we &s;hall not &s;eek his face in vain.</P>

For vain and earthly de&s;igns are no more allowable in our employ|ments, than in our alms and devotions. They are not only evil when they mix with our good works," with our religious actions, "but they have the &s;ame evil nature when they enter into the common bu&s;ine&s;s of our employments. If it were allowable to pur&s;ue them in our worldly em|ployments, it would be allowable to pur&s;ue them in our devotions. But as our alms and devotions are not an acceptable &s;ervice, but when they proceed from a pure intention, &s;o our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">on employment cannot be reckoned a &s;ervice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, but when it is performed with the &s;ame piety of heart."</P>

<P>And it is al&s;o matter of daily experience, that <HI>by grace we are</HI> thus &s;aved <HI>through faith.</HI> It is by faith that the eye of the mind is opened, to &s;ee the light of the glorious love of God.

<P>With regard to mo&s;t of the commandments of God, whether relating to the heart or life, the heathens of Africa or America &s;tand much on a level, with tho&s;e that are called chri&s;tians. The chri&s;tians ob&s;erve them (a few only being except|ed) very near as much as the heathens. For in|&s;tance: the generality of the natives of England, commonly called chri&s;tians, are as &s;ober and as temperate, as the generality of the heathens, near the Cape of Good Hope. And &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">he Dutch or French chri&s;tians, are as humble and as cha&s;te, as the Choctaw or Cherokee-Indians. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, when we compare the bulk of the nations in <HI>Europe</HI> with tho&s;e in <HI>America,</HI> whether
<PB N="230" REF="028060_0491_0FD68E6F0EB1EEB0">the &s;uperiority lies on the one &s;ide or the other. At lea&s;t the <HI>American</HI> has not much the advantage. But we cannot affirm this, with regard to the com|mand now before us. Here the heathen has far the pre-eminence. He de&s;ires and &s;eeks nothing more than plain food to eat, and plain raiment to put on. And he &s;eeks this only from day to day. He re&s;erves, he lays up nothing; unle&s;s it be, as much corn at one &s;ea&s;on of the year, as he will need before that &s;ea&s;on returns. This com|mand, therefore, the heathens, though they know it not, do con&s;tantly and punctually ob&s;erve. They <HI>lay up for them&s;elves no trea&s;ures upon earth;</HI> no &s;tores of purple or &s;ine linen, of gold or &s;ilver, which either <HI>moth or ru&s;t may corrupt,</HI> or <HI>thieves break through and &s;teal.</HI> But how do the chri&s;ti|ans ob&s;erve, what they profe&s;s to receive as a com|mand of the mo&s;t high God? not at all; not in any degree; no more than if no &s;uch command had ever been given to man. Even the <HI>good chri&s;|tians,</HI> as they are accounted by others as well as them&s;elves, pay no manner of regard thereto. It might as well be &s;till hid in its original <HI>Greek,</HI> for any notice they take of it. In what chri&s;tian ci|ty do you find one man of five hundred, who makes the lea&s;t &s;cruple, of laying up ju&s;t as much trea&s;ure as he can? of increa&s;ing his goods ju&s;t as far as he is able? there are indeed tho&s;e who would not do this unju&s;tly; there are many who will neither rob nor &s;teal; and &s;ome, who will not defraud their neighbour; nay, who will not gain, either by his ignorance or nece&s;&s;ity. But this is quite another point. Even the&s;e do not &s;cruple the thing but the manner of it. They do not
<PB N="231" REF="028060_0492_0FD68E73AC46C720">&s;cruple the <HI>laying up trea&s;ures upon earth;</HI> but the laying them up by di&s;hone&s;ty. They do not &s;tart at di&s;obeying Chri&s;t, but at a breach of hea|then morality. So that even the&s;e hone&s;t men do no more obey this command, than a high|wayman or a hou&s;e-breaker. Nay, they never de&s;igned to obey it. From their youth up, it never entered into their thoughts. They were bred up by their chri&s;tian parents, ma&s;ters and friends, without any in&s;truction at all concern|ing it: unle&s;s it were this, to break it as &s;oon, and as much as they could, and to continue break|ing it to their lives end.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is no one in&s;tance of &s;piritual infa|tuation in the world, which is more amazing than this. Mo&s;t of the&s;e very men read, or hear the bible read, many of them every Lord's day.

<P N="11">11. Do you a&s;k, what it is to lay <HI>up trea&s;ures on earth?</HI> it will be needful to examine this tho|roughly. And let us, fir&s;t, ob&s;erve, what is not forbidden in this command, that we may then clearly di&s;cern, what is.</P>
<P>We are not forbidden in this command, Fir&s;t, <HI>to provide things hone&s;t in the &s;ight of all men,</HI> to

<P>Neither, Secondly, does he here forbid the pro|viding for our&s;elves, &s;uch things as are needful for the body; a &s;ufficiency of plain, whole&s;ome food to eat, and clean raiment to put on.

Therefore, what&s;oever the wi&s;e men of the world may &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>Ye cannot &s;erve</HI> God <HI>and mammon.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mammon</HI> was the name of one of the hea|then gods, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over riches. It is here under&s;tood of riches them|&s;elves; gold and &s;ilver, or in general, money: and by a common figure of &s;peech, of all that may be purcha&s;ed thereby; &s;uch as ea&s;e, honour, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But what are we here to under&s;tand, by <HI>&s;erving</HI> God? and what, by <HI>&s;erving mammon?</HI></P>
<P>We cannot <HI>&s;erve</HI> God, unle&s;s we believe in him. This is the only true foundation of &s;erv|ing him. Therefore, the believing in God, as <HI>reconciling the world to him&s;elf</HI> through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the believing in him, as a loving, par|doning God, is the fir&s;t great branch of his &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>And, thus to believe in God implies, to <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in him as our &s;trength, without whom we can do nothing, who every moment endues us with power from on high, without which it is impo&s;|&s;ible to plea&s;e him: as our help, our only help in time of trouble, who compa&s;&s;eth us about with &s;ongs of deliverance: as our &s;hield, our defend|er, and the lifter up of our head above all our enemies that are round about us.</P>
<P>It implies, to tru&s;t in God as our happine&s;s; as the centre of &s;pirits, the only re&s;t of our &s;ouls; the only good who is adequate to all
<PB N="258" REF="028060_0517_0FD68EB3D4AAD138">our capacities, and &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy all the de|&s;ires he hath given us.</P>
<P>It implies (what is nearly allied to the other) to tru&s;t in God, as our end; to have an eye to him in all things; to u&s;e all things only as means of enjoying him: where&s;oever we are, or what|&s;oever we do, to &s;ee him that is invi&s;ible, looking on us well-plea&s;ed, and refer all things to him in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="5">5. Thus to believe, is the fir&s;t thing we are to under&s;tand by <HI>&s;erving</HI> God. The &s;econd is, to love him.</P>
<P>Now, to love God in the manner the &s;crip|ture de&s;cribes, in the manner God him&s;elf re|quires of us, and by requiring engages to work in us, is to love him as the one God; that is, <HI>with all our heart and with all our &s;oul, and with all our mind, and with all our &s;trength:</HI> it is, to de&s;ire God alone for his own &s;ake; and nothing el&s;e, but with reference to him: to re|joice in God; to delight in the Lord; not only to &s;eek but find happine&s;s in him: to enjoy God as the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and; to re&s;t in him, as our God and our all. In a word, to have &s;uch a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of God, as makes us always happy.</P>
<P N="6">6. A third thing we are to under&s;tand by <HI>&s;erv|ing</HI> God, is, to re&s;emble or imitate him.</P>
<P>So the ancient father, <HI>Optimus Dei cultus, imi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ari quem colis.</HI> It is the be&s;t wor&s;hip or &s;ervice of God, to imitate him you wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>We here &s;peak, of imitating or re&s;embling him in the &s;pirit of our minds. For here the true chri&s;tian imitation of God begins. God
<PB N="259" REF="028060_0518_0FD68EB5515F8668">is a &s;pirit; and they that imitate or re&s;emble him, mu&s;t do it in &s;pirit and in truth.</P>
<P>Now God is love. Therefore they who re&s;em|ble him in the &s;pirit of their minds, are trans|formed into the &s;ame image. They are merciful, even as he is merciful. Their &s;oul is all love. They are kind, benevolent, compa&s;&s;ionate, ten|der-hearted: and that not only to the good and gentle, but al&s;o to the froward. Yea, they are, like him, loving unto every man, and their mercy extends to all his works.</P>
<P N="7">7. One thing more we are to under&s;tand by <HI>&s;erving</HI> God, and that is, the obeying him; the glorifying him with our bodies, as well as with our &s;pirits; the keeping his outward command|ments: the zealou&s;ly doing whatever he hath en|joined, the carefully avoiding whatever he hath forbidden: the performing all the ordinary acti|ons of life, with a &s;ingle eye and a pure heart; offering them all in holy, fervent love, as &s;acrifices to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let us con&s;ider now, what we are to un|der&s;tand, on the other hand, by <HI>&s;erving mam|mon.</HI> And fir&s;t, it implies, the tru&s;ting in rich|es, in money, or the things purcha&s;eable thereby, as our &s;trength, the means whereby we &s;hall perform, whatever cau&s;e we have in hand: the tru&s;ting in them as our help, by which we look to be comforted in, or delivered out of trouble.</P>
<P>It implies, the tru&s;ting in the world for hap|pine&s;s; the &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>a man's life con&s;i&s;t|eth</HI> (the comfort of his life) <HI>in the abundance of
<PB N="260" REF="028060_0519_0FD68EBD28644948">the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth:</HI> the looking for re&s;t, in the things that are &s;een; for content in out|ward plenty; the expecting that &s;atisfaction in the things of the world, which can never be &s;ound out of God.</P>
<P>And if we do this, we cannot but make the world our end; the ultimate end, if not of all, at lea&s;t of many of our undertakings, many of our actions and de&s;igns: in which we &s;hall aim only at an increa&s;e of wealth, at the obtaining plea|&s;ure or prai&s;e; at the gaining a larger mea&s;ure of temporal things, without any reference to things eternal.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>&s;erving mammon</HI> implies, Secondly, Loving the world; de&s;iring it for its own &s;ake; the placing our joy in the things thereof, and &s;et|ting our hearts upon them; the &s;eeking (what in|deed it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould find) our happine&s;s therein; the re&s;ting with the whole weight of our &s;ouls upon the &s;taff of this broken reed; although daily experience &s;hews it cannot &s;upport, but will only <HI>enter into our hand and pierce it.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. To re&s;emble, to be conformed to the world, is a third thing we are to under&s;tand by <HI>&s;erving mammon:</HI> to have not only de&s;igns, but de&s;ires, tempers, affections &s;uitable to tho&s;e of the world: to be of an earthly, &s;en&s;ual mind, chained down to the things of earth: To be &s;elf-willed, inordinare lavers of our&s;elves; to think highly of our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ments; to de&s;ire and delight in the prai&s;e of men: to fear, &s;hun, and abhor reproach: To be impatient of re|proof, ea&s;y to be provok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and &s;wift to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rn evil for evil.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="261" REF="028060_0520_0FD68EBF12702378">
11. To <HI>&s;erve mammon</HI> is, la&s;tly, to obey the world, by outwardly conforming to its maxims and cu&s;toms; to walk as other men walk, in the common road, in the broad, &s;mooth, beaten path; to be in the fa&s;hion, to follow a multi|tude; to do like the re&s;t of our neighbours; that is, to do the will of the fle&s;h and the mind, to gratify our appetites and inclinations; to &s;a|crifice to our&s;elves; aim at our own ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, in the general cour&s;e both of our words and actions.</P>
<P>Now what can be more undeniably clear, than that we <HI>cannot</HI> thus <HI>&s;erve</HI> God <HI>and mam|mon?</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Does not every man &s;ee, that he cannot <HI>comfortably</HI> &s;erve both?

25. Above all, do not make the care of fu|ture things, a pretence for neglecting pre&s;ent duty. This is the mo&s;t fatal way of <HI>taking thought for the morrow.</HI> And how common is it among men? Many, if we exhort them to keep a con&s;cience void of offence, to ab&s;tain from what they are convinced is evil, do not &s;cru|ple to reply, "How then mu&s;t we live? Mu&s;t we not take care of our&s;elves and of our families?" And this they imagine to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, for continuing in known, wilful &s;in. They &s;ay, and perhaps think, they would &s;erve God now; were it not that they &s;hould by and by lo&s;e their bread. They would prepare for eternity; but they are afraid of wanting the nece&s;&s;aries of life. So they &s;erve the devil for a mor&s;el of bread; they ru&s;h into hell, for fear of want; they throw away their poor &s;ouls, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ome time or other fall &s;hort of what is needful for their bodies.</P>
<P>It is not &s;trange that they who thus take the matter out of God's hand, &s;hould be &s;o often di&s;appointed of the very things they &s;eek; that while they throw away heaven, to &s;ecure the things of earth, they lo&s;e the one, but do not gain the other. The jealous God, in the wi&s;e cour&s;e of his providence, frequently &s;uffers this. So that they who will not ca&s;t their care on God, who taking thought for temporal things, have little concern for things eternal, lo&s;e the very portion which they have cho&s;en. There is a vi&s;ible bla&s;t on all their undertakings: What&s;oever they do, it doth not pro&s;per. In&s;o|much, that after they have for&s;aken God for the world, they lo&s;e what they &s;ought, as well
<PB N="273" REF="028060_0532_0FD68EE417667A80">as what they &s;ought not. They fall &s;hort of the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s; nor yet are other things added unto them.</P>
<P N="26">26. There is another way of <HI>taking thought for the morrow,</HI> which is equally forbidden in the&s;e words. It is po&s;&s;ible to <HI>take thought</HI> in a wrong manner, even with regard to &s;piritual things; to be &s;o careful about what may be by and by, as to neglect what is now required at our hands. How in&s;en&s;ibly do we &s;lide into this, if we are not continually watching unto prayer? how ea&s;ily are we carried away, in a kind of waking dream, projecting di&s;tant &s;chemes, and drawing fine &s;cenes in our own imagination! we think, what good we will do, when we are in &s;uch a place, or when &s;uch a time is come! how u&s;eful we will be, how plenteous in good works, when we are ea&s;ier in our circum&s;tances? how earne&s;tly we will &s;erve God, when once &s;uch an hinderance is out of the way.</P>
<P>Or, perhaps, you are now in heavine&s;s of &s;oul: God, as it were, hides his face from you. You &s;ee little of the light of his countenance; you cannot ta&s;te his redeeming love. In &s;uch a temper of mind, how natural is it to &s;ay. "O how I will prai&s;e God, when the light of his countenance &s;hall be again lifted up upon my &s;oul? how will I exhort others to prai&s;e him, when his love is again &s;hed abroad in my heart? then I will do thus and thus: I will &s;peak for God in all places: I will not be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Then I will redeem the time. I will u&s;e to the uttermo&s;t every talent I have received." Do not believe thy&s;elf. Thou wilt not do it then, unle&s;s thou do&s;t it now. <HI>He

<P N="27">27. And <HI>take no thought</HI> for the temptations of to-morrow. This al&s;o is a dangerous &s;nare. Think not, "When &s;uch a temptation comes, what &s;hall I do, how &s;hall I &s;tand? I feel, I have not power to re&s;i&s;t: I am not able to conquer that enemy." Mo&s;t true: you have not now the power which you do not now &s;tand in need of.

<P N="1">1. OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord, having now fini&s;hed his main de&s;ign, having fir&s;t, delivered the &s;um of true religion, carefully guarded again&s;t tho&s;e glo&s;&s;es of men, whereby they would make the word of God of none effect: and having, next, laid down rules touching that right inten|tion, which we are to pre&s;erve in all our outward actions: now proceeds to point out the main hin|derances of this religion, and concludes all with a &s;uitable application.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the fifth chapter our great teacher has fully de&s;cribed inward religion in its various branches. He has there laid before us tho&s;e di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="281" REF="028060_0538_0FD68EF16AE49740">of &s;oul, which con&s;titute real chri&s;tia|nity; the tempers contained in that holine&s;s, <HI>without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord;</HI> the af|fections, which when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are intrin&s;ically and e&s;&s;entially good, and acceptable to God. In the &s;ixth he has &s;hewn, how all our actions likewi&s;e, even tho&s;e that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good, and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he declares is of no value with God: whereas whatever outward works are thus con&s;ecrated to God, are in his &s;ight of great price.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the former part of this chapter he points out the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t fatal hinderances of this holine&s;s. In the latter, he exhorts us by various motives, to break through all, and &s;ecure that prize of our high calling.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fir&s;t hinderance he cautions us again&s;t is judging. <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Judge not others, that ye be not judged of the Lord, that ye bring not vengeance on your own heads. <HI>For with what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged, and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again:</HI> a plain and equitable rule, whereby God permits you to determine for your&s;elves, in what manner he &s;hall deal with you in the judgment of the great day.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is no &s;tation of life, nor any pe|riod of time, from the hour of our fir&s;t repent|ing and believing the go&s;pel, till we are made perfect in love, wherein this caution is not needful for every child of God. For occa&s;ions
<PB N="282" REF="028060_0539_0FD68EF2D5C93988">of judging can never be wanting. And the temptations to it are innumerable: many where|of are &s;o artfully di&s;gui&s;ed, that we fall into the &s;in, before we &s;u&s;pect any danger. And un|&s;peakable are the mi&s;chiefs produced hereby; always to him that judges another: thus wound|ing his own &s;oul, and expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the righteous judgment of God: and frequently to tho&s;e who are judged, who&s;e hands hang down, who are weakened and hindered in their cour&s;e, if not wholly turned out of the way, and cau&s;ed to draw back even to perdition. Yea, how often, when this <HI>root of bitterne&s;s &s;prings up,</HI> are <HI>many defiled thereby:</HI> by rea&s;on whereof the way of truth it&s;elf is evil &s;poken of, and that worthy name bla&s;phemed whereby we are called.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet it does not appear, that our Lord de|&s;igned this caution, only or chiefly for the chil|dren of God: but rather for the children of the world, for the men who know not God. The&s;e cannot but hear of tho&s;e, who are not of the world, who &s;ollow after the religion above-de&s;cribed: who endeavour to be humble, &s;eri|ous, gentle, merciful and pure in heart; who earne&s;tly de&s;ire &s;uch mea&s;ures of the&s;e holy tem|pers, as they have not yet attained: and wait for them in doing all good to all men, and pa|tiently &s;uffering evil.

They &s;pend their time in finding out their neighbour's faults, in&s;tead of amending their own. They are &s;o bu&s;ied about others go|ing out of the way, that them&s;elves never come into it at all: at lea&s;t, never get forward, never go beyond a poor dead form of godline&s;s without the power.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is to the&s;e more e&s;pecially that our Lord &s;ays, <HI>Why beholde&s;t thou the mote that is in thy bro|ther's eye,</HI> the infirmities, the mi&s;takes, the im|prudence, the weakne&s;s of the children of God; <HI>but con&s;idere&s;t not the beam that is in thine own eye?</HI> thou con&s;idere&s;t not the damnable impeni|tence, the fanatic pride, the accur&s;ed &s;elf-will, the idolatrous love of the world, which are in thy&s;elf, and which make thy whole life an abomination to the Lord. Above all, with what &s;upine carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indifference art thou dancing over the mouth of hell? and how then, with what grace, with what decency or mo|de&s;ty, <HI>wilt thou &s;ay to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye,</HI> the exce&s;s of zeal for God, the extreme &s;elf-denial, the too great di&s;|engagement from worldly cares and employ|ments, the de&s;ire to be day and night in prayer, or hearing the words of eternal life? <HI>and be|hold a beam is in thine own eye!</HI> not a mote, like one of the&s;e. <HI>Thou hypocrite!</HI> who pretende&s;t to care for others and ha&s;t no care for thy own &s;oul! who maketh a &s;how of zeal for the cau&s;e of God, when in truth thou neither love&s;t nor feare&s;t him! <HI>fir&s;t ca&s;t out the beam out of thine own eye.</HI> Ca&s;t out the beam of impenitence.
<PB N="284" REF="028060_0541_0FD68EF5CFDE1688">Know thy&s;elf. See and feel thy&s;elf a &s;inner. Feel, that thy inward parts are very wickedne&s;s, that thou art altogether corrupt and abominable, and that the wrath of God abideth on thee. Ca&s;t out the beam of pride. Abhor thy&s;elf. Sink down as in du&s;t and a&s;hes. Be more and more little and mean, and ba&s;e and vile in thine own eyes. Ca&s;t out the beam of &s;elf-will. Learn what that meaneth, <HI>if any man will come after me, let him renounce him&s;elf.</HI> Deny thy&s;elf and take up thy cro&s;s daily. Let thy whole &s;oul cry out, <HI>I came down from heaven</HI> (for &s;o thou did&s;t, thou never-dying &s;pirit, whether thou knowe&s;t it or no) <HI>not to do my own will, but the will of him that &s;ent me.</HI> Ca&s;t out the beam of love of the world. Love not the world, neither the things of the world. Be thou crucified unto the world, and the world crucified unto thee. Only u&s;e the world, but <HI>enjoy</HI> God. Seek all thy happine&s;s in him. Above all, ca&s;t out the grand beam, that &s;upine carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indifference. Deeply con|&s;ider, that <HI>one thing is needful,</HI> the one thing which thou ha&s;t &s;carce ever thought of. Know and feel, that thou art a poor, vile, guilty worm, quivering over the great gulph! what art thou? a &s;inner born to die: a leaf driven before the wind: a vapour ready to vani&s;h away: ju&s;t appearing, and then &s;cattered into air, to be no more &s;een! &s;ee this, <HI>and then &s;halt thou &s;ee clearly to ca&s;t out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</HI> Then, if thou ha&s;t lei&s;ure from the concerns of thy own &s;oul, thou &s;halt know how to correct thy brother al&s;o.</P>
<P N="8">8. But what is properly the meaning of this word, <HI>judge not?</HI> what is the <HI>judging</HI> which is
<PB N="285" REF="028060_0542_0FD68EFB893F85F0">here forbidden? it is not the &s;ame as evil-&s;peak|ing, although it is frequently joined therewith. Evil-&s;peaking is, the relating any thing that is evil, concerning an ab&s;ent per&s;on: whereas judg|ing may indifferently refer, either to the ab&s;ent or the pre&s;ent. Neither does it nece&s;&s;arily imply the &s;peaking at all, but only the <HI>thinking evil</HI> of another. Not, that all kind of thinking evil of others, is that judging which our Lord con|demns. If I &s;ee one commit robbery or murder, or hear him bla&s;pheme the name of God, I can|not refrain from thinking ill of the robber or murderer. Yet this is not evil judging: there is no &s;in in this, nor any thing contrary to tender affection.</P>
<P N="9">9. The thinking of another, in a manner that is contrary to love, is that judging which is here condemned, and this may be of various kinds. For, fir&s;t, we may think another to blame when he is not. We may lay to his charge (at lea&s;t in our own mind) the things of which he is not guil|ty: the words which he has never &s;poke, or the actions which he has never done. Or we may think his manner of acting was wrong, although in reality it was not. And even where nothing can ju&s;tly be blamed, either in the thing it&s;elf, or in the manner of doing it, we may &s;uppo&s;e, his intention was not good, and &s;o condemn him on that ground; at the &s;ame time that he who &s;earches the heart, &s;ees his &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity.</P>
<P N="10">10. But we may not only fall into the &s;in of judging, by condemning the innocent, but al&s;o, &s;econdly, by condemning the guilty, in a higher degree than he de&s;erves. This &s;pecies of judg|ing
<PB N="286" REF="028060_0543_0FD68EFCA4833E88">is likewi&s;e an offence again&s;t ju&s;tice as well as mercy: and yet &s;uch an offence as nothing can &s;ecure us from, but the &s;tronge&s;t and tendere&s;t affection. Without this, we readily &s;uppo&s;e one who is acknowledged to be in fault, to be more in fault than he really is. We undervalue whatever good is found in him. Nay, we are not ea&s;ily in|duced to believe, that any thing good can remain in him, in whom we have found any thing that is evil.</P>
<P N="11">11. All this &s;hews a manife&s;t want of that love, which <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Thinketh no evil:</HI> which never draws an unju&s;t or unkind conclu|&s;ion, from any premi&s;es what&s;oever. Love will not infer, from a per&s;on's falling once into an act of open &s;in, that he is accu&s;tomed &s;o to do, that he is habitually guilty of it. And if he was habitu|ally guilty once, love does not conclude, he is &s;o &s;till: much le&s;s, that if he is now guilty of this, there|fore he is guilty of other &s;ins al&s;o. The&s;e evil rea&s;onings all pertain to that &s;inful judging, which our Lord here guards us again&s;t: and which we are in the highe&s;t degree concerned to avoid, if we love either God or our own &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="12">12. But &s;uppo&s;ing we do not condemn the in|nocent, neither the guilty any farther than they de&s;erve: &s;till we may not be altogether clear of the &s;nare. For there is a third &s;ort of &s;inful judging, which is the condemning any per&s;on at all where there is not a &s;ufficient evidence. And be the facts we &s;uppo&s;e ever &s;o true, yet that does not acquit us. For they ought not to have been &s;uppo&s;ed but proved, and till they were, we ought to have formed no judgment, I &s;ay, till
<PB N="287" REF="028060_0544_0FD68EFE6B39A0C8">they were: for neither are we excu&s;ed, although the facts admit of ever &s;o &s;trong proof, unle&s;s that proof be produced before we pa&s;s &s;entence, and compared with the evidence on the other &s;ide. Nor can we be excu&s;ed, if ever we pa&s;s a full &s;entence, before the accu&s;ed has &s;poken for him&s;elf. Even a jew might teach us this, as a mere le&s;&s;on of ju&s;tice ab&s;tracted from mercy and brotherly love. <HI>Doth our law,</HI> &s;ays Nicodemus, <HI>Judge any man before it hear him and know what he doth? John.</HI> xvii. 51. Yea, a heathen could reply, when the chief of the jewi&s;h nation de|&s;ired to have judgment again&s;t his pri&s;oner, <HI>it is not the manner of the Romans to</HI> judge <HI>any man before he that is accu&s;ed have the accu&s;ers face to face, and have licence to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, concerning the crime laid again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Indeed we could not ea&s;ily fall into &s;inful <HI>judging,</HI> were we only to ob&s;erve that rule, which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seneca.</NOTE> another of tho&s;e heathen <HI>Romans</HI> affirms to have been the mea&s;ure of his own practice. "I am &s;o far, &s;ays he, from lightly believing every man's, or any man's evidence again&s;t another, that I do not ea&s;ily or immediately be|lieve a man's evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. I always allow him &s;econd thoughts, and many times council too." Go thou who art called a chri&s;|tian, and do likewi&s;e, le&s;t the heathen ri&s;e and condemn thee in that day.</P>
<P N="14">14. But how rarely &s;hould we condemn or judge one another, at lea&s;t, how &s;oon would that evil be remedied, were we to walk by that clear and expre&s;s rule, which our Lord him&s;elf has taught us? <HI>If thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="028060_0545_0FD68F0083CD6B50">(or if thou hear, or believe that he hath) <HI>go and tell him of his fault, between him and thee alone.</HI> This is the fir&s;t &s;tep thou art to take. <HI>But if he will not hear, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es, every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> This is the &s;econd &s;tep. <HI>If he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church;</HI> either to the over&s;eers thereof, or to the whole congregation. Thou ha&s;t then done thy part. Then think of it no more, but commend the whole to God.</P>
<P N="15">15. But &s;uppo&s;ing thou ha&s;t, by the grace of God, <HI>ca&s;t the beam out of thine own eye,</HI> and do&s;t now <HI>clearly &s;ee the mote or beam which is in thy brother's eye,</HI> yet beware thou do&s;t not receive hurt thy&s;elf, by endeavouring to help him Still <HI>give not that which is holy unto dogs.</HI> Do not lightly account any to be of this num|ber. But if it evidently appear, that they de|&s;erve the title, then ca&s;t ye not your <HI>pearls be|fore &s;wine.</HI> Beware of that zeal which is not according to knowledge. For this is another great hinderance in their way who would be <HI>perfect as</HI> their <HI>heavenly Father is perfect.</HI> They who de&s;ire this, cannot but de&s;ire that all man|kind &s;hould partake of the common ble&s;&s;ing.

Hence we are for attacking all we meet without delay, and con&s;training them to &s;ee, whether they will or no. And by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this intemperate zeal, we often

It would not be &s;trange, if they were, according to their nature, to <HI>turn again, and rent you:</HI> if they were to return you evil for good, cur&s;ing for ble&s;&s;ing, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed for your good-will. Such is the enmity of the car|nal mind, again&s;t God and all the things of God. Such the treatment you are to expect from the&s;e, if you offer them the unpardonable affront, of endeavouring to &s;ave their &s;ouls from death, to pluck them as brands out of the burning!</P>
<P N="18">18. And yet you need not utterly de&s;pair even of the&s;e, who for the pre&s;ent <HI>turn again and rent you.</HI> For if all your arguments and per&s;ua&s;ives fail, there is yet another remedy left; and one that is frequently found effectual, when no other method avails. This is prayer. Therefore what|ever you de&s;ire or want, either for others or for your own &s;oul, <HI>a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you: &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find: kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, and it &s;hall be open|ed unto you.</HI> The neglect of this is a third grand hinderance of holine&s;s. Still we have not, <HI>be|cau&s;e we a&s;k not.</HI> O how meek and gentle, how lowly in heart, how full of love both to God and man, might ye have been at this day, if you had only a&s;ked? if you had <HI>continued in&s;tant in prayer!</HI> therefore now, at lea&s;t, <HI>a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given unto you. A&s;k,</HI> that ye may throughly experience and perfectly practi&s;e the whole of that religion, which our Lord has here &s;o beatifully de&s;cribed. <HI>It &s;hall then be
<PB N="292" REF="028060_0549_0FD68F0B97B66F40">given you,</HI> to be holy as he is holy, both in heart and in all manner of conver&s;ation. <HI>Seek,</HI> in the way he hath ordained, in &s;earching the &s;criptures, in hearing his word, in meditating thereon, in fa&s;ting, in partaking of the &s;upper of the Lord, and &s;urely <HI>ye &s;hall find.</HI> Ye &s;hall find that pearl of great price, that faith which overcometh the world, that peace which the world cannot give, that love which is the earne&s;t of your inheri|tance. <HI>Knock:</HI> continue in prayer, and in every other way of the Lord. Be not weary or faint in your mind. Pre&s;s on to the mark. Take no denial. Let him not go until he ble&s;s you. And the door of mercy, of holine&s;s, of heaven <HI>&s;hall be opened unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. It is in compa&s;&s;ion to the hardne&s;s of our hearts, &s;o unready to believe the goodne&s;s of God, that our Lord is plea&s;ed to enlarge upon this head, and to repeat and confirm what he hath &s;poken. <HI>For every one,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that a&s;keth, receiveth:</HI> &s;o that none need come &s;hort of the ble&s;&s;ing: <HI>and he that &s;eeketh,</HI> even every one that &s;eeketh, <HI>findeth,</HI> the love and the image of God: <HI>and to him that knocketh,</HI> to every one that knock|eth, the gate of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be opened. So that here is no room for any to be di&s;couraged, as though they might a&s;k or &s;eek or knock in vain. Only remember, <HI>always to pray,</HI> to &s;eek, to knock <HI>and not to be faint</HI> And then the promi&s;e &s;tand|eth &s;ure. It is firm as the pillars of heaven. Yea, more firm; for heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but his word &s;hall not pa&s;s away.</P>
<P N="20">20. To cut off every pretence for unbelief, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in the following ver&s;es, il|lu&s;trates
<PB N="293" REF="028060_0550_0FD68F0B9DE1EED0">yet farther what he had &s;aid, by an ap|peal to what pa&s;&s;es in our own brea&s;ts. <HI>What man,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>is there of</HI> you, <HI>who, if his &s;on a&s;k bread, will he give him a &s;tone?</HI> will even na|tural affection permit you to refu&s;e the rea&s;onable reque&s;t of one you love? <HI>or if he a&s;k a fi&s;h, will he give him a &s;erpent?</HI> will he give him hurtful, in&s;tead of profitable things? &s;o that even from what you feel and do your&s;elves, you may receive the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance, as, on the one hand, that no ill effect can po&s;&s;ibly attend your a&s;king, &s;o on the other, that it will be attended with that good effect, a full &s;upply of all your wants. For <HI>if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &s;hall your Father which is in heaven,</HI> who is pure, unmixed, e&s;&s;ential good|ne&s;s, <HI>give good things to them that a&s;k him?</HI> or, (as he expre&s;&s;es it on another occa&s;ion) <HI>give the Holy Gho&s;t to them that a&s;k him?</HI> In him are in|cluded all good things; all wi&s;dom, peace, joy, love: the whole trea&s;ure of holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s: all that God hath prepared for them that love him.</P>
<P N="21">21. But that your prayer may have its full weight with God, &s;ee that ye be in charity with all men. For otherwi&s;e, it is more likely to bring a cur&s;e than a ble&s;&s;ing on your own head: nor can you expect, to receive any ble&s;&s;ing from God, while you have not charity towards your neigh|bour. Therefore let this hinderance be removed without delay. Confirm your love towards one another and towards all men. And love them, not in word only, but in deed and in truth. <HI>Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would, that
<PB N="294" REF="028060_0551_0FD68F0DB047D530">men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o unto them: for this is the have and the prophets.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. This is that royal law, that golden rule of mercy as well as ju&s;tice, which even the heathen emperor cau&s;ed to be written over the gate of his palace: a rule, which many believe to be na|turally engraved on the mind of every one that comes into the world. And thus much is certain, that it commends it&s;elf, as &s;oon as heard, to every man's con&s;cience and under&s;tanding: in&s;omuch that no man can knowingly offend again&s;t it, without carrying his condemnation in his own brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>This is the law and the prophets.</HI> What|&s;oever is written in that law which God of old revealed to mankind; and what&s;oever precepts God has given by <HI>his holy prophets, which have been &s;ince the world began,</HI> they are all &s;ummed up in the&s;e few words, they are all contained in this &s;hort direction. And this rightly under&s;tood comprizes the whole of that religion, which our Lord came to e&s;tabli&s;h upon earth.</P>
<P N="24">24. It may be under&s;tood, either in a po&s;i|tive or negative &s;en&s;e. If under&s;tood in a ne|gative &s;en&s;e, the meaning is, "Whatever ye would not that men &s;hould do to you, do not ye unto them." Here is a plain rule, always ready at hand, always ea&s;y to be applied. In all ca&s;es relating to your neighbour, make this ca&s;e your own. Suppo&s;e the circum&s;tances to be changed, and your&s;elf to be ju&s;t as he is now. And then beware that you indulge no temper or thought, that no word pa&s;s out of your lips, that you take no &s;top which you &s;hould have condemned
<PB N="295" REF="028060_0552_0FD68F0E942954C8">in him, upon &s;uch a change of circum&s;tances. If under&s;tood in a direct and po&s;itive &s;en&s;e, the plain meaning of it is, "What&s;oever you could rea&s;onably de&s;ire of him, &s;uppo&s;ing your&s;elf to be in his circum&s;tance, that do, to the uttermo&s;t of your power, to every child of man."</P>
<P N="25">25. To apply this in one or two obvious in&s;tan|ces. It is clear to every man's own con&s;cience, we would not that others &s;hould <HI>judge</HI> us, &s;hould cau&s;ele&s;sly or lightly think evil of us. Much le&s;s would we that any &s;hould &s;peak evil of us, &s;hould publi&s;h our real faults or infirmities. Apply this to your&s;elf. Do not unto another what you would not he &s;hould do unto you; and you will never more <HI>judge</HI> your neighbour, never cau&s;ele&s;sly or lightly think evil of any one. Much le&s;s will you &s;peak evil: You will never mention even the real fault of an ab&s;ent per&s;on, unle&s;s &s;o far as you are convinced, it is ab&s;olutely needful, for the good of other &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="26">26. Again: We would that all men &s;hould love and e&s;teem us, and behave towards us, ac|cording to ju&s;tice, mercy and truth. And we may rea&s;onably de&s;ire, that they &s;hould do us all the good they can do, without injuring them|&s;elves: Yea, that in outward things (accord|ing to the known rule) their &s;uperfluities &s;hould give way to our conveniencies, their convenien|cies to our nece&s;&s;ities, and their nece&s;&s;ities to our extremities. Now then let us walk by the &s;ame rule: Let us do unto all, as we would they &s;hould do to us. Let us love and honour all men. Let ju&s;tice, mercy and truth govern all our minds and actions. Let our &s;uperfluities give way to our neighbour's conveniencies: (and who then will
<PB N="296" REF="028060_0553_0FD68F106E4D7C30">have any &s;uperfluities left?) Our conveniencies to our neighbour's nece&s;&s;ities, our nece&s;&s;ities to his extremities.</P>
<P N="27">27. This is pure and genuine morality. This do and thou &s;halt live. <HI>As many as walk by this rule, peace be to them, and mercy:</HI> for they are the <HI>I&s;rael of</HI> God. But then be it ob&s;erved, none can walk by this rule (nor ever did from the beginning of the world) none can love his neighbour as him&s;elf, unle&s;s he fir&s;t love God. And none can love God, unle&s;s he believe in Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he have redemption thro' his blood, and the &s;pirit of God bearing witne&s;s with his &s;pirit, that he is a child of God. Faith therefore is &s;till the root of all, of pre&s;ent as well as future &s;alvation. Still we mu&s;t &s;ay to every &s;inner, Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved. Thou &s;halt be &s;aved now, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved for ever; &s;aved on earth, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved in heaven Believe in him and thy faith will work by love. Thou wilt love the Lord thy God, becau&s;e he hath loved thee: Thou wilt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. And then it will be thy glory and joy, to exert and increa&s;e this love, not barely by ab&s;taining from what is contrary thereto, from every unkind thought, word and action, but by &s;hewing all that kindne&s;s to every man, which thou would&s;t he &s;hould &s;hew unto thee.</P>
