<HEAD>DETECTION OF A CONSPIRACY, FORMED BY THE <HI>UNITED IRISHMEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE long thought, that the French have form+ed a regular plan for organizing an active and effective force within the&s;e States; and I am per&s;uaded, that after what I am now going to lay before the public &s;hall have been read with attention, few people will be &s;o blind as not to perceive, that my opinion was well founded. The Pari&s;ian Propagande have, in every country that they wi&s;hed to ruin, found villains in abundance ready to engage in their &s;ervice. The am|bitious they have allured by the pro&s;pect of power, and the needy by that of pillage. In America there is le&s;s ambition and le&s;s poverty than in mo&s;t other countries, and therefore, though &s;ome traitors have been found among&s;t them, the <HI>natives</HI> were not much to be relied on, in the pro&s;ecution of any de&s;ign, evidently ho&s;tile to the intere&s;ts and honour of their country. They might be deceived, they might be duped to lend their aid indirectly to &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign; but no man, who
<PB N="4" REF="048395_0003_10250641DA415BF8">
is led on in the dark, can be &s;afely confided in; becau&s;e, at the fir&s;t dawn of light, it is a thou&s;and to one but he makes his retreat.</P>
<P>The French &s;eem to have been fully aware of this. Indeed, they learnt this truth from the mortifying defection of the AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. There were many well-meaning men, who became members of the&s;e &s;editious meetings from ignorance, and who di&s;covered no incon&s;iderable zeal in propa|gating their principles; but, the bandage was torn from their eyes, and no &s;ooner did they perceive the real views of DALLAS and the other leaders, than they turned their backs on them with dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>This le&s;&s;on induced the French to exert their <HI>"diplomatic &s;kill'</HI> in choo&s;ing in&s;truments more fit for their purpo&s;e. Ignorance when allied with hone&s;ty was no tool for them to work with. Real, &s;incere, villainy, then without property, without principles, without country and without character; dark and de&s;|perate, unnatural and bloody-thir&s;ty ruffins; the&s;e were what they wanted; and where could they have &s;ought them with &s;uch certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, as among&s;t that re&s;tle&s;s rebellious tribe, the emigrated UNITED IRISHMEN? The wretches known by this name, had e&s;caped from their country to avoid a puni&s;hment ju&s;tly due to their multitude of crimes. <HI>Here</HI> they expected to find an organized &s;y&s;tem of perpetual anarchy: the needy anticipated a life of lazine&s;s and plunder, the ambitious thought to gra&s;p on power already moulded
<PB N="5" REF="048395_0004_10250645A262CBA0">
to their hands; they all counted upon a &s;tate of things, congenial to their own wicked di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Happily for us, they were deceived. They found a government, which, if too weak (like their own) to puni&s;h con&s;pirators according to their de&s;erts, was yet too &s;turdy to fall pro&s;trate at their feet. They found property protected from their fraternizing clutches; they &s;aw their hopes of political con&s;equence vani&s;h like a dream; and, in&s;tead of care&s;&s;es, condolence and applau&s;e, from the people, they meet with the &s;ame virtuous abhorrence that had followed them from the &s;hores of their native land.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, thus mortified, thus humbled and di&s;graced, it was not to be wondered at, that they conceived a hatred again&s;t America equal to that which they entertained agai&s;t their own country, and it is &s;till le&s;s to be wondered at, that they enrolled them|&s;elves in the treacherous &s;ervice of France.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I heard of the exi&s;tence of a Society of United Iri&s;hmen <HI>here,</HI> was by a printed paper (a copy of which the reader will &s;ee by-and-bye dated the 18th December la&s;t, and &s;igned Js. REYNOLDS. It was envelloped in a piece of paper addre&s;&s;ed to me, and was left by an unknown hand, at the hou&s;e of a per&s;on in Market-&s;treet. It was on the 16th of January that I received this paper, and in about three weeks afterwards, the <HI>plan</HI> of the con&s;piracy was conveyed to me through the &s;ame channel.</P>
<P>This <HI>plan,</HI> which is called a <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> is printed in
<PB N="6" REF="048395_0005_1025064733B84BA0">
a &s;mall octavo pamphlet, bearing date the 8th of Au|gu&s;t la&s;t. The imprint imports, that it was printed at Philadelphia, for the &s;ociety; but the <HI>printer's name</HI> is very cautiou&s;ly omitted. The per&s;on who enclo&s;ed me the pamphlet, has, indeed, written in the margin the name of a printer, who, from the villainous publi|cations which have come from his pre&s;s, I make no doubt was really the man; but this evidence is too weak for me to proceed upon in publi&s;hing his name to the world, as guilty of an offence, which amount to trea&s;on again&s;t the United States.&mdash;Here follows the <HI>plan</HI> of the <HI>con&s;piracy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Declaration.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Six hundred years have pa&s;t, &s;ince divi&s;ion and fraud reduced Ireland to colonial &s;ub&s;erviency; the divi&s;ion of her people have ever &s;ince &s;ubjected them to the la&s;h and to the good of a foreign tyranny; a tyranny more odious than A&s;iatic de&s;poti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In our day and generation we have &s;een and we have felt; it is not nece&s;&s;ary, there is not now time cooly to count over the long black catalogue of her baleful wrongs; there is not now time to argue and complain.</HI> THIS IS THE TIME TO ACT; to act with energy we mu&s;t act with union: Iri&s;hmen are united at home, we will not be di&s;united abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Our love for freedom has not been le&s;&s;ened by what we have experienced of its effects, or for Ireland by our di&s;|tance.

Under the &s;acred influence of devotion to the Uni|on, EQUALITY AND LIBERTY of ALL men, we gladly embrace the &s;olemn ties by which we wi&s;h to be bound to one another, and hereby form our&s;elves into an a&s;&s;ociation,</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="constitution">
<HEAD>UNDER THE NAME OF <HI>THE AMERICAN SOCIETY</HI> OF UNITED IRISHMEN, ADOPTING THE FOLLOWING <HI>CONSTITUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>[The declared intention of procuring <Q>equality and liberty to ALL men,</Q> is a clear proof Ireland alone was not in their view. But, as we go on, we &s;hall perceive that neither that country nor its concerns are at all included in the objects of the&s;e people. The words <HI>Ireland, Iri&s;hmen,</HI> &amp;c. are mere &s;ub&s;titutes for other words, like the cant of the pick-pockets, ac|cording to which a <HI>hog</HI> means a <HI>&s;hilling,</HI> a <HI>pig</HI> means a <HI>&s;ixpence,</HI> and &s;o on. This will clearly appear from the articles and TEST of the precious con&s;titution.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 1. That ALL SUCH PERSONS and &s;uch only, &s;hall be eligible to this Society of United Iri&s;hmen, as &s;hall have &s;uffered in the cau&s;e of freedom, or who, by their zeal for THE RIGHTS OF MAN|KIND, &s;hall have rendered them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hed and worthy of attachment and tru&s;t.</P>
<P>[Thus, you &s;ee, it is not IRISHMEN alone, who are eligible to this Society; but ALL SUCH PER|SONS as &s;hall, according to their cant, have <HI>&s;uffered in the cau&s;e of freedom,</HI> or have &s;hown their zeal for <HI>the
<PB N="8" REF="048395_0007_1025064B58662B88">
rights of mankind!!</HI> In other words, every &s;coundrel, of whatever nation, is eligible, provided he has been manacled or tran&s;ported, or has rendered him&s;elf wor|thy of the gibbet, for &s;ome attempt at rebellion or &s;ome act of trea&s;on, no matter under what government or on what occa&s;ion; or, provided his &s;editious principles are &s;o well known and e&s;tabli&s;hed as to leave no room to doubt of his attachment to the cau&s;e. <HI>Americans,</HI> then, and <HI>Britons,</HI> and <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and men of every coun|try being eligible to the Society, can any one be &s;illy enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that the con&s;piracy had <HI>Ireland</HI> in view? What had any of the&s;e people to do with <HI>Ire|land?</HI> But, on the ab&s;urdity of this we &s;hall have time to remark by-and-by. Indeed, the TEST it&s;elf gives the lie to this cant about Ireland. All that it is nece&s;|&s;ary to remak on this &s;ection, is, <HI>that it provides for the admi&s;&s;ion of every di&s;contented, factious man in the Uni|ted States:</HI> and that the latter part of it is no more than a copy of the qualification clau&s;e of the Jacobin Club at Paris, except that the latter required po&s;itive proof from every new member of his having <HI>actually committed &s;ome crime de&s;erving the halter,</HI> while our li|beral con&s;pirators, thinking it unju&s;t to exclude a vil|lain merely becau&s;e he has failled of &s;ucce&s;s, are willing, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to admit the <HI>intention</HI> as equal in merit to the deed.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 2. That no per&s;on &s;hall be propo&s;ed for ad|mittance but by a member in his place.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 3. That no propo&s;ition for the admittance of a member &s;hall be received, unle&s;s it be &s;econded by

another member pre&s;ent, and that it &s;hall likewi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary for the propo&s;er and &s;econder, to vouch for the moral character and CIVISM of the per&s;on propo&s;|ed; in defect of which, no election &s;hall take place.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 4. Members &s;hall have the privilege of pro|po&s;ing, or &s;econding the propo&s;al of candidates, in any Section, as well as that to which they belong.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 5. A candidate propo&s;ed agreeable to the 2d, 3d, and 4th &s;ections, &s;hall not be ballotted for, until the next meeting after that in which he has been propo&s;ed, unle&s;s known to two-thirds of the members pre&s;ent, (two black beans to reject without a rea&s;on, and one with rea&s;ons), but, upon his election, he &s;hall be immediately admitted, under the following forms:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 6. Before a per&s;on elected &s;hall be con&s;ider|ed a member, the Pre&s;ident &s;hall put to him the fol|lowing que&s;tions; an affirmative to the 1&s;t, 5th and 6th, and a negative an&s;wer to the 2d, 3d, and 4th, &s;hall be indi&s;pen&s;able to admi&s;&s;ion as &s;uch:</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 7. I. Do you believe a free form of govern|ment, and uncontrouled opinion on all &s;ubjects, to be the common rights of all the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="2">II. Do you think the people of Ireland are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e rights.</P>
<P N="3">III. Do you think the government of Great Bri|tain ever was, or is now di&s;po&s;ed, to acknowledge, or a&s;&s;ent, to the freedom of Ireland.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Do you think Great Britain ought, of right, to govern Ireland.</P>

Moreover, I do &s;wear, that I will, as far as in me lies, promote the intere&s;t of this, and every other Society of United Iri&s;hmen, and of each of its members&mdash;and that I will never, from fear of puni&s;hment, or hope of reward, divulge any of its</HI> SE|CRETS <HI>given to me as &s;uch.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Section</HI> 8. That the TEST of this Society, the INTENTION of this INSTITUTION, (in all other re&s;pects than as a <HI>&s;ocial body,</HI> attached to free|dom,) be con&s;idered as SECRET AND INVIO|LABLE in all ca&s;es, but between members, and in the body of the Society.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 9. That neverthele&s;s, a member of the So|ciety &s;hall not be con&s;idered as divulging its &s;ecrets, who &s;hall propound to per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to become mem|bers, the &s;en&s;e of the &s;ix propo&s;itions which <HI>precede the te&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>[Here we &s;ee that Ireland is almo&s;t dropped out of &s;ight. It is ju&s;t mentioned in order to introduce the Briti&s;h government; but the initiated is to &s;wear, that he will do the utmo&s;t of his power for the attainment of LIBERTY and EQUALITY, to MANKIND; and, the&s;e efforts does he &s;wear to make, IN WHAT|EVER NATION HE MAY RESIDE! Ireland, therefore, if not totally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the TEST, is no more contemplated by it than America is, taking the words in their literal &s;en&s;e: and we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;e|quel, that this ble&s;&s;ed liberty and equality is entended for America alone.</P>
<P>The crimality of the purpo&s;e and end of the com|bination
<PB N="11" REF="048395_0010_1025065469B09798">
is mo&s;t amply proved by the &s;ection that im|mediately follows the TEST.&mdash;<Q>The TEST of this &s;ociety and the INTENTION of the in&s;titution &s;hall be kept SECRET and INVIOLABLE.</Q>&mdash; The members may tell the world that it is a <Q><HI>&s;ocial body,</HI> attached to freedom;</Q> that is, they may give out that its principles are friendly to general liberty; they may repre&s;ent it as one of tho&s;e collections of individuals that men of &s;en&s;e u&s;ually laugh at, but they mu&s;t not &s;ay a word about the INTENTION of the in&s;titution, nor mu&s;t they di&s;cover the nature of the OATH.</P>
<P>Now, if nothing more were meant than an a&s;&s;ocia|tion again&s;t <HI>the government of Great Britain,</HI> which they mu&s;t well know would excite contempt and ridi|cule, why all this <HI>&s;ecrecy?</HI> Why conceal the nature of the oath? and, particularly, why conceal the <HI>intention</HI> of the in&s;titution?</P>
<P>By the 9th Section we &s;ee, that the di&s;coveries, made even to tho&s;e who offer them&s;elves as members, are to extend no further than "the &s;en&s;e of the &s;ix propo&s;itions <HI>preceding</HI> the TEST." The Te&s;t it&s;elf they are to know nothing of, 'till they have gone too far to retreat, and then they are bound not to divulge what they have learnt. Fir&s;t the initiated member &s;wears, that he <Q>will never, from <HI>fear of puni&s;hment,</HI> or <HI>hope of reward,</HI> divulge any of the <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> given to him as &s;uch?</Q> and then the INTENTION of the in&s;titution is immediately given to him as one of tho&s;e <HI>inviolable &s;ecrets!</HI> If there were nothing wicked,
<PB N="12" REF="048395_0011_10250656F9B0E7D8">
nothing highly criminal, nothing dark and traiterous in this INTENTION, why is the di&s;covery of it thus guarded again&s;t? Men never <HI>"fear puni&s;hment"</HI> for concealing what is not criminal. Indeed, this TEST &s;tamps the character of the combination: a Te&s;t of &s;ecrecy, as to the <HI>motives</HI> of the members, is e&s;&s;ential to a con&s;piracy; and it is that which di&s;tingui&s;hes this &s;ociety from <HI>"a &s;ocial body,"</HI> which is the character they wi&s;h to appear under in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>Here again we perceive the plan to be little more than a copy of that of the Jacobin club in France. The <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> is di&s;carded, and the initiated wretch &s;wears by the "SUPREME BEING." Next <HI>Liberty and Equality to mankind</HI> is the object, <HI>in whatever country they may re&s;ide;</HI> the world are to be told, that the &s;ociety is merely a <HI>&s;ocial body;</HI> but its real INTENTION is to be kept a &s;ecret under the mo&s;t &s;olemn injunctions. Thus proceeded the Jaco|bins at Paris, that <HI>&s;ocial body</HI> who overturned the government of France. PLAYFAIR &s;ays, they had <HI>two creeds,</HI> one to <HI>amu&s;e the public,</HI> and another that, for long time, never was known but to the members.</P>
<P>The oath of &s;ecrecy nece&s;&s;arily forbids a communi|cation of one of the pamphlets containing the TEST, &amp;c. the per&s;on who made this communication to me mu&s;t, therefore, have broken his oath, or mu&s;t have pur|loined the pamphlet. I rather think the former; becau&s;e had he not thus committed him&s;elf; were it not that he was a&s;hamed to own him&s;elf one of the
<PB N="13" REF="048395_0012_102506589A5C7D48">
con&s;pirators, and at the &s;ame time, incurred the odium of having betrayed his companions, it is pretty clear' that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an inclination to make the di&s;covery' he would long ago have come forward as the in&s;trument of an effectual pro&s;ecution. He tells me in a note which covered one of the papers, that he has <HI>found a clue</HI> to all their &s;ecrets, and, as I before ob&s;erved&punc; he writes down the name of the printer in the margin. This latter circum&s;tance was enough; for, if the printing could be proved, or if it can be proved now, the printer at lea&s;t, can be puni&s;hed as a con&s;pirator, and this may lead to a di&s;covery of his employers.</P>
<P>Having thus remarked on the de&s;ign of the con|&s;pirators, I &s;hould now come to the means provided for <HI>in&s;uring its &s;ucce&s;s,</HI> by which the reader will at lea&s;t &s;ee the extent of the plan, and will be fully con|vinced that its real object is the de&s;truction of the Ame|rican Government.]</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 10. The member thus initiated &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe his name to the con&s;titution, and pay to the trea&s;urer, half a dollar.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 11. The monthly &s;ub&s;cription of each mem|ber &s;hall be a quarter of a dollar; payable on the fir&s;t meeting in every month: if the member be elected af|ter the twentieth of any month, he &s;hall pay no more than his fee of initiation for that month.</P>
<P><HI>Section</HI> 12. If any member neglect to pay the re&s;|pective &s;ums before mentioned, for the &s;pace of three months, the &s;ecretary of his &s;ection &s;hall then &s;ignify, in writing to the member, the amount of the arrears, and demand payment, and that in default thereof, his name and the &s;um due, &s;hall be publicly read by the trea&s;urer of the &s;ection to which he may belong, on

the three next &s;ucceeding meetings thereof, and if his arrears be not paid on the third reading, he &s;hall be ex|cluded the Society.

<P><HI>Section</HI> 13. Any per&s;on elected by ballot, who &s;hall not attend three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meetings after his election, &s;hall forfeit it, unle&s;s due cau&s;e be &s;hewn to the proper &s;ection for his ab&s;ence.</P>

<P>[Now, leaving the mere formalities and other tri|fling things a&s;ide, let us take this plan and look at it in its &s;ub&s;tance. It is very properly called an <HI>"en|larged organization,"</HI> for it embraces an extent no le&s;s than that of the whole Union.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we &s;ee, that every re&s;tle&s;s wretch, of whatever nation, is admitted into any &s;ection of the &s;ociety,
<PB N="19" REF="048395_0018_102506694FC59900">
and has his name, place of re&s;idence, &amp;c. enrolled on its li&s;t; but, le&s;t the a&s;&s;emblages &s;hould become un|wieldly, or alarming to the magi&s;trates, the&s;e &s;ections when they get to a certain &s;trength, &s;eparate, and the detached parts form new ones, ju&s;t as bees &s;warm when the hive is over-crowded &mdash; The troops being thus enrolled in the &s;ections, the next thing is to render them manageable. Were the &s;ections &s;ubjected to no &s;uperior command; were they to remain &s;cattered over the country without any common head, they would be like &s;o many independent companies without a com|mander. But, the&s;e troops have not been rai&s;ed to <HI>lie in idlene&s;s,</HI> and, therefore, a mode of uniting their efforts is provided. The &s;ections in every &s;tate are to &s;end delegates to form a <HI>State-Committee;</HI> and the&s;e &s;ixteen State-Committees are to &s;end delegates to form a <HI>"General EXECUTIVE Committee;"</HI> and this is the whole brought to one point.</P>
<P>So much for the organization. Now for the ope|rative part of the plan.</P>
<P><HI>"The General</HI> EXECUTIVE <HI>Committee"</HI> (which, I have not the lea&s;t doubt, is now &s;itting in Philadelphia) keeps up a con&s;tant communication with the State-Committees, and from it, the whole Society, or rather <HI>army,</HI> receives "directions" when and how to act. It has returns made to it of the numbers enrolled in each State, of the names, re&s;idence, and occupation, of the per&s;ons enrolled; by this mean it is at all times in|formed of its &s;trength, and of where that &s;trength lies.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="048395_0019_1025066B20D3F228" MS="y">When it is nece&s;&s;ary TO ACT, the General <HI>Exe|cutive</HI> Committee are to di&s;patch their orders to the State Committees; the&s;e to their &s;ections, and the&s;e a|gain (by their committee of <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI>) to their <HI>&s;ub-&s;ections.</HI> Here the orders reach the <HI>active troops,</HI> and that there may be no confu&s;ion in their movements, the&s;e <HI>&s;ub-&s;ections</HI> con&s;i&s;t of only <HI>eight</HI> men each, all <HI>living near one another,</HI> and one of the&s;e eight is a &s;ort of non-commi&s;&s;ion officer, who (to u&s;e the very words of the con&s;pirators) is to "have the <HI>charge</HI> of the other &s;even, and is to WARN them IN CASES OF UR|GENCY"!!!</P>
<P>Now, I appeal to any man of common &s;en&s;e, whe|ther this infernal combination can po&s;&s;ibly have any other object in view than an in&s;urrection again&s;t the government of America. What <HI>"ca&s;es of urgency"</HI> can ari&s;e <HI>in this country,</HI> what opportunity can offer it|&s;elf <HI>here,</HI> for <HI>overturning the Briti&s;h Government in Ire|land?</HI> Were the villains, indeed furni&s;hed with <HI>wings;</HI> could they like other birds of pa&s;&s;age, a&s;&s;emble in a flock and take their flight to Ireland; then the o&s;ten&s;i|ble motive of the a&s;&s;ociation would have &s;omething like plau&s;ibility about it; but, as they are, this o&s;ten&s;ible motive is a palpable ab&s;urdity, a mere trick which has been invented in order to inveigh ignorant per&s;ons to take the TEST, and, in ca&s;e of detection, to avoid the puni&s;hment which the law awards to <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>&s;pies;</HI> or at lea&s;t, to leave room for doubt and conten|tion in the courts of ju&s;tice; a bad chance being bet|ter
<PB N="21" REF="048395_0020_102506700377B5E8">
than none, and ten years impri&s;onment being better than death.</P>
<P>That this con&s;piracy is intended <HI>to aid the cau&s;e of France,</HI> it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on; every one mu&s;t perceive it at the fir&s;t glance.&mdash;What can the&s;e ragged ru&s;&s;ians expect to do <HI>alone?</HI> How can they alone &s;upport their current expences, exclu&s;ive of <HI>"ca&s;es of urgency,"</HI> of arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. By an attention to the financical part of their plan, you will perceive, that the money they collect from the members is barely &s;ufficient to defray the charges which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be incurred for rooms to meet in. Who is to pay for printing their CONSTITUTIONS, their CERTIFICATES (which I hear is from an engra|ved copper plate); who is to pay for the time and travelling expences of all their Delegates from the Sec|tions to the State Committees, and from them to the General Executive Committee at Philadelphia; who is to pay a &s;um amounting to not le&s;s than <HI>forty thou|&s;and dollars</HI> annually? Who but tho&s;e who boa&s;t of their "Diplomatick Skill," <HI>and of their</HI> <Q>powerful faction in this country;</Q> tho&s;e who have long had in pay the leading <HI>patriots</HI> in Ireland, and who have con&s;tantly &s;upported a hireling pre&s;s in each of the principal Cities of America?</P>
<P>Next, ob&s;erve that the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy exi&s;ts be|tween the &s;ans-culotte French, who are here, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the emigrated United Iri&s;hmen, and a ba&s;e American printer, notoriou&s;ly in the &s;ervice of France. Ob&s;erve too, that NAPPER TANDY
<PB N="22" REF="048395_0021_10250672989916B0">
went from New York to France, and that the con&s;pi|racy, as appears by its date, was not formed, 'till <HI>after we heard of his arrival at Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The leaders in this con&s;piracy are the very &s;ame per&s;ons, who conducted that in Ireland. When a &s;ection of their deluded partizans, in that country, were taken unawares by the King's troops, no money but <HI>French</HI> was found upon them, and this in a retired part of the kingdom, where it was impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e in&s;atuated wretches could have come at it through any other channel than that of the de&s;pots of Paris and their wicked agents. And, if a con&s;piracy could be &s;o effectually paid there, in a country at open war with France, with an <HI>alien law,</HI> vigourou&s;ly enforced, how ea&s;y mu&s;t it be for them to maintain a hired and regu|larly paid con&s;piracy here, when there is no check what&s;oever to their machinations!</P>
<P>This diabolical plan was formed on the 8th of Au|gu&s;t la&s;t, immediately before the YELLOW FEVER commenced its ravages in this city; with this in his recollection the reader will form his opinion re&s;pecting the following, which is a copy of the <HI>printed paper,</HI> before mentioned.</P>

<P>This is the man, who began his canting letter, re&s;|pecting his attack on Mr. Pickering, with declaring that he was come <HI>here</HI> in &s;earch of "REPOSE"!!&mdash; I will ju&s;t remark further on this notice, that I would lay my life it was tran&s;lated from the French.&mdash;<Q>That view &s;o con&s;oling to humanity.</Q>&mdash;This is French in Engli&s;h words.&mdash;<Q>a manly people whom &s;ix hundred

years &s;lavery could not deba&s;e, are about to be re&s;|tored to their right.</Q>&mdash;A very awkward tran&s;lation of French cant.</P>
<P>This notice, I would have the reader believe, I have not publi&s;hed without good proof of its being &s;igned by REYNOLDS, the &s;eeker of "REPOSE." His name is <HI>written,</HI> and the hand writing has not only been carefully compared with the &s;ignature to a letter of his, now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but has al&s;o been com|pared and verified before one of the judges in this city. All that is now wanted is, good proof of the per&s;on who <HI>printed,</HI> or who <HI>authorized printing,</HI> the plan of the con|&s;piracy, which is called the CONSTITUTION, and if any American, <HI>native</HI> or <HI>adopted,</HI> is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of producing &s;uch proof, and neglects to pro|duce it, he is to all intents and purpo&s;es a TRAITOR.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, now, briefly &s;tate, what I have lately gathered re&s;pecting the members of which the con&s;pi|racy now con&s;i&s;ts, and re&s;pecting the manner in which they are to ACT, and on what occa&s;ions. In the mean time, I would have THOSE, in who&s;e power alone it is to counteract the baleful effects of this helli&s;h combination, to recollect, that any ALIEN LAW, which extends only to ALIENS of a <HI>nation committing ho&s;tilities on the United States,</HI> will not reach the members of this affiliation.</P>
<P>I am informed, by one of the per&s;ons who manage the affairs of the AFRICAN SCHOOL, that the United Iri&s;hmen have not a&s;&s;embled there, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and that the rea&s;on of this was, their number was be|come
<PB REF="048395_0024_10253B7D01BB1998">
<HI>too great</HI> for &s;o &s;mall a room. I am al&s;o well informed, that two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have been admitted into the Society (I dare &s;ay there are two hundred, and that they earne&s;tly &s;olicited <HI>another Engli&s;hman</HI> to join it. Their &s;trength, at this time, in this city and twenty miles round, con&s;i&s;ts of above <HI>fifteen hun+dred;</HI> no contemptible number, if we con&s;ider how &s;hort the &s;pace is, &s;ince they began to enli&s;t. A <HI>&s;ec|tion</HI> has been formed at New-York, another at Balti|more, and another is either formed, or about to be formed, at Chamber&s;burgh, in this &s;tate. Indeed, there is very little doubt, but we &s;hall very &s;oon receive &s;atisfactory information of their being organized in every &s;tate, and in every principal city and town in the Union.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their calling their troops into <HI>ac|tual &s;ervice,</HI> it is clear that they would proceed in the &s;ame manner as the Jacobins in every other country have done. Con&s;pirators are always cowards: be&s;ides this, they know too well their weakne&s;s to attempt an attack on the Government, unaided by any other party, and unprotected by a foreign power. Their whole bu&s;ine&s;s therefore, at pre&s;ent, is, to organize them&s;elves; to enli&s;t and number their troops, and to lie in wait for what they very properly call, <HI>"ca&s;es of URGENCY."</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>"diplomatic &s;kill"</HI> of France had been ex|erci&s;ed with &s;uch complete &s;ucce&s;s as the tyrants of that wretched country &s;uppo&s;ed it was; if it had been found, upon trial, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very numerous and for|midable faction here entirely devoted to her orders, the&s;e <HI>"ca&s;es of URGENCY"</HI> might have ari&s;en
<PB REF="048395_0025_1025067A59722130">
from internal commotions. This &s;ource now &s;eems to be dried up. The di&s;patches from France have rob|bed the "Si&s;ter Republic" of all her adherents, ex|cept the mo&s;t abandoned and infamous mi&s;creants a|mong&s;t the Americans, her own &s;ans-culottes, and the half-gibbeted democrats from Great Britain and Ireland. Nothing, then, can give ri&s;e to one of tho&s;e <Q>ca&s;es of URGENCY</Q> &s;hort of an inva&s;ion by France either from the Spani&s;h territory, or from the &s;ea; and, for an event of this kind the con&s;pirators are ooking for with hopes much more &s;anguine than wan|dering &s;eed of Abraham ever looked for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>An inva&s;ion on the coa&s;t is a thing naturally to be expected, unle&s;s an alliance is formed with Great Bri|tain: from Lou&s;iana or the Floridas is to be expected, whether &s;uch an alliance takes place or no. This, then, would be the <HI>"ca&s;e of URGENCY,"</HI> and thus the con&s;pirators would act. Before the panic would be over, (for there are your panic people in all countries) the whole affiliation would be in movement. They would thwart, threaten, or collect mobs; openly op|po&s;e, or &s;ecretly betray, ju&s;t as it &s;uited their &s;everal &s;ituations. They are not vi&s;ible now, but then they would be &s;een and felt too. I make no doubt but they have members, in &s;ome capacity or other, in every public department. I &s;hould not wonder if they had at this time fifty in the different branches of the Po&s;t|office. Thus has it proved in every country, which the infamous &s;ans-culottes have invaded with &s;ucce&s;s. In Holland, for in&s;tance, few people feared the invaders. The barriers were well fortified, well garri&s;oned, we &s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ions, and the people appeared <HI>unanimous</HI> in their hatred of the enemy. But the fortre&s;&s;es fell, nobody could tell how; the French arrived as if it were <HI>by appointment,</HI> and many of tho&s;e who had been the loude&s;t in their expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t them, were the fir&s;t that they took by the hand.
<PB REF="048395_0026_1025067CEBB26AA8">
The&s;e villains had held a corre&s;pondence with them, and afterwards made a boa&s;t of their trea&s;on; the ja|cobin affiliation ran through all the United Provinces; its members had crept into every department, civil and military; the mine was completed, and, at the approach of the enemy it was &s;prung. Ju&s;t &s;o was it in Italy, in Geneva, in Venice; &s;o was it in Switzerland; &s;o will it be in Spain, and would it have been in Britain long ago, had it not been for her in&s;ular &s;ituation and the watchfulne&s;s and vigour of her government.</P>

Her <HI>di&s;tance from France</HI> is often, and, I mu&s;t add, very &s;tupidly, held out as a guaran|tee for her &s;afety. I might in&s;i&s;t that there is no bar|rier between her and the Spani&s;h territory, which no|body would deny; but, waving that, what, without the interference of Great Britain, is there to prevent twenty thou&s;and &s;ans-culottes from landing in this country? And, if they &s;hould do this, how many circum&s;tances has America again&s;t her which no &s;tate in Europe knew any thing of!</P>
<P>From various cau&s;es the&s;e United States have be|come the re&s;ting place of ninety nine hundredths of the factions villains, which Great Britain and Ireland have vomitted from their &s;hores. They are all &s;chool|ed in &s;edition, are adepts at their trade, and they mo&s;t certainly bear as cordial a hatred to this government as they did to their own. The French &s;ans-culottes now here, capable of bearing arms, amount to at lea&s;t thirty thou&s;and, all furious ruffians, puffed up with vanity, &s;tarving with hunger, and &s;ighing for conque&s;t and pillage.</P>
<P><PB REF="048395_0027_1025067E7AF615F0">Great numbers of the&s;e wretches, of all countries, are what are called CITIZENS; &s;o that no <HI>alien law</HI> will touch them. Several hundreds of French have very lately been admitted to this de&s;tructive privilege and it is well known, that REYNOLDS is not only a citizen, but the <HI>political father</HI> of other citizens; for he has been &s;uffered to vouch for their "good moral character and <HI>their attachment to "Con&s;titution,"</HI> a ne|ce&s;&s;ary prelude to their admi&s;&s;ion. The penal code has been &s;oftened down, till it has no terrors, except for the hone&s;t man, who &s;tands in need of <HI>protection.</HI> There are &s;ixteen governments, all in &s;ome mea&s;ure in|dependent of the general government, to whom the &s;afety of the nation is committed, and the&s;e &s;ixteen are very far from being all in the hands of &s;uch men as would lend their cordial &s;upport to that general govern|ment. The villain, who would get his neck &s;tretched in the Federal courts, would very probably e&s;cape through other hands. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things the civil magi&s;trate mu&s;t hold a blunted, if not a broken, &s;word; and as to the military, though I would be willing to &s;take every thing on their <HI>valour,</HI> yet valour alone without &s;kilful commanders and &s;oldier well di&s;ciplined, is like a razor in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>But, what renders the &s;ituation of America more favourable to the views of France than any other coun|try, is, the <HI>negro &s;lavery</HI> to the Southward. On this it is that the villains ground their hope. It is &s;aid that &s;ome of the <HI>free</HI> negroes have already been admit|ted into the con&s;piracy of the UNITED IRISHMEN, and that &s;ome &s;lave holders either in Carolina or Virginia have engaged, in <HI>"a ca&s;e of URGENCY,"</HI> to &s;et their negroes free, in order to excite di&s;contents among&s;t
<PB REF="048395_0028_102506800FEDAAD0" MS="y">
tho&s;e of their neighbours, and thus involve the whole country in rebellion and blood&s;hed. I do not take up|on me to &s;ay that the&s;e preparatory &s;teps have been taken, but this I know, that nothing could be thought more helli&s;h or better calculated to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of people who will <HI>&s;mile</HI> at all this, and will call it a mere bug bear: the&s;e are, the muddy-headed men of indifference and the jacobins them&s;elves. But, I tru&s;t the real friends of government will &s;ee it in its true light, and will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be lulled a&s;leep by the &s;ongs of Doctor "REPOSE" and his adherents. All the&s;e people want for the pre&s;ent is, to &s;ee the government <HI>quiet,</HI> dull, and un&s;u&s;pecting. This is what they wi&s;hed in Britain and Ireland. Every precautionary mea&s;ure of the legi&s;lature or the execu|tive; every <HI>inquiry,</HI> however legal, and however deli|cately conducted, they brand with the name of "jea|lous tyranny;" and to every hone&s;t man, who has the zeal to come forward in the di&s;covery of their infernal plots, they give the appellation of SPY. This has had much influence on weak minds. Your <HI>good-natured peaceable</HI> man cannot bear the name of <HI>&s;py</HI> or <HI>informer;</HI> he would &s;ooner &s;ee his neighbours burnt in their beds, and his own wife and children along them. I hope, how|ever, that there is yet good &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough le&s;s among&s;t us to de&s;pi&s;e every thing the&s;e artful treacher|ous villains can &s;ay, and to defeat every thing they &s;hall attempt. The man, who &s;hall bring the leaders of this con&s;piracy to the halter, will de&s;erve as well of his country as tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;hed their blood in its de|fence.</P>
