<HEAD>An <HI>Examination</HI> of AND &s;ome <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to THE <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> Narrative &amp; Defence.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Ca&s;e of the fir&s;t Church and Pari&s;h in <HI>Springfield,</HI> with Re&s;pect to the Set|tlement of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Robert Breck</HI> in the pa&s;toral Office among them, has in|deed made <HI>a great Noi&s;e through the Coun|try;</HI> and the <HI>Conduct of tho&s;e who have been immediately concern'd,</HI> approv'd or <HI>blam'd,</HI> accor|ding to the Information Per&s;ons have received, or as they have &s;tood affected to one or other of the acting Parties. But the <HI>extraordinary Noi&s;e</HI> has been occa&s;ioned by the <HI>extraordinary Methods</HI> taken to hin|der the &s;aid Settlement, in direct Oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e Liberties of the Churches, which are confirm'd to them by Law, and they have been in the con&s;tant U&s;e and Exerci&s;e of. If the Reverend Gentlemen in the County of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who di&s;approv'd of Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> s Settlement at <HI>Springfield,</HI> could but have thought they kept them&s;elves pure, by forbearing to act in it them&s;elves, and &s;ending their formal
<PB N="2" REF="003996_0004_100373EDE0A957E8">Prote&s;t again&s;t it, and then left tho&s;e call'd by the Church to judge in the Affair, (of which Number were the Elde&s;t Mini&s;ters in their own County) to have acted according to their Light &amp; Con&s;ciences, with|out employing the &s;ecular Arm upon the Occa&s;ion, much of the Noi&s;e had, to be &s;ure, been prevented. Or if after the &s;trange Interpo&s;ition of &s;ome in civil Authority, to which we have very good Grounds to think the di&s;approving Gentlemen of the &s;acred Order were acce&s;&s;ary, they could have been conten|ted to have let the Matter remaind the Subject of Conver&s;ation only, without runing it into the pub|lic Prints, the Noi&s;e had been &s;till much le&s;s, and the Cen&s;ures be&s;tow'd on either Party fewer and milder. But not thinking enough was done to blacken Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> and bring an odious Imputation on the Council, by the two Letters publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Bo&s;ton Journal,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it may be remark'd, That the&s;e Letters were publi&s;h'd the Day before the Complaint of the Church in <HI>Springfield</HI> was to be heard in the Honourable Hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;entatives,</HI> and were indu&s;triou&s;ly put into the Hands of the Members, no doubt to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them, that nothing might be done in Favour of the Church or Mr. <HI>Breck.</HI> A Specimen of their fair way of managing!</NOTE> by the&s;e Gentlemen them&s;elves, or &s;ome Body that undertook their Vindication, before any Thing had been publi&s;h'd on the other Side of the Que&s;tion, they have now thru&s;t into the World a remarkable Piece, containing about &s;even Sheets; intitled, <HI>A Narrative and Defence of the Proceedings of the Mini&s;ters of Hamp&s;hire, who di&s;approv'd of Mr. Breck's Settlement at Springfield.</HI> And becau&s;e <HI>Vis unita fortior,</HI> it is &s;aid in the Title Page to be <HI>Written by them&s;elves.</HI> The Text of &s;acred Scripture with which this Page is grac'd, is certainly very pertinent and well cho|&s;en, viz. that Pa&s;&s;age of the wi&s;e <HI>Solomon, "He that
<PB N="3" REF="003996_0005_100358A321EE66C0">un&s;wereth a Matter before be heareth it, it is Folly and Shame unto him".</HI> It may therefore well be &s;uppos'd tho&s;e into who&s;e Hands their Narrative has been put, have &s;u&s;pended their Judgment, till they hear the other Side, and will not think them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Merits of the Cau&s;e, by hearing it only <HI>ex Parte.</HI> E&s;pecially &s;ince the &s;ame royal Author tells us pre&s;ently after, <HI>He that is fir&s;t in his own Cau&s;e, &s;eemeth ju&s;t; but his Neighbour cometh and &s;earcheth him.</HI> i. e. <Q>He that &s;peaks fir&s;t will be &s;ure to tell a &s;traight Story, and relate that only which makes for him, and put the be&s;t Colour he can upon it, &s;o that his Cau&s;e &s;hall appear good, whether it be really &s;o or no. But the Plaintiff having done his Evidence, 'tis fit the Defendant &s;hould be heard, and have Leave to &s;hew the Fal&s;ehood &amp; Fallacy of what has been alledg'd, which perhaps may make the Matter appear quite otherwi&s;e than it did.</Q></P>
<P>In the Introduction to their Performance, le&s;t the World &s;hould think they had medled with what did not belong to them, they let us know that <HI>the Mini|&s;ters of the County of Hamp&s;hire were obliged both by their Situation and Office to act in this Affair.</HI> As to their <HI>Situation,</HI> it is indeed in the &s;ame County; but the Churches in this &s;ame County are at a large Di&s;tance from one another. And &s;ome of the&s;e very Gentle|men live twenty, thirty, or near forty Miles from <HI>Springfield:</HI> So that &s;ome Mini&s;ters in another Coun|ty, and indeed in another Province, were as conve|niently &s;ituated to have acted in the Affair as them|&s;elves. <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> is in the County of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> yet the Mini&s;ters there have not tho't them&s;elves oblig'd by their Situation to act in the Affairs of every Church in the County. The&s;e Gentlemen &s;eem to lay a
<PB N="4" REF="003996_0006_100374009DF2F630">great Stre&s;s in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y upon their Limits as a County; tho' we are perfectly at a Lo&s;s by what Law or Rule they make the Churches to follow the Civil Di&s;tricts. The Towns in the Pro|vince we know are by the Legi&s;lative Power laid out into Countys; but we did not know the Churches were. If they are, &s;hould there not be a Shire-Church too in every County, for the holding eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Courts in? The&s;e would be a new Kind of Churches indeed, &s;uch as we have not yet heard of. We have heard of <HI>National</HI> Churches, and of <HI>Provin|cial</HI> and <HI>Cla&s;&s;ical,</HI> but we do not know a Name for the&s;e, unle&s;s that of <HI>Comitatic</HI> may be allowed. &mdash; But it may be their Obligation is &s;tronger from their <HI>Office.</HI> As to <HI>this,</HI> we &s;uppo&s;e them by their Office to be Pa&s;tors of particular Churches, which were committed to their Care at their Ordination; and that they are obliged to act in the Affairs of other Churches only as their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by Advice, or o|therwi&s;e, may be de&s;ir'd &amp; &s;ought, by tho&s;e Churches in Communion with them that think they need it. Or if they con&s;ider them&s;elves as Mini&s;ters in the Catholic Church, and therefore obliged to take Care of all the Churches; &s;o are other Pa&s;tors: and we can't &s;ee but the Obligation which ari&s;es from hence lies upon others equally with them&s;elves.&mdash;But if their <HI>Situation</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> an't quite enough to give them Authority to act in the Affairs of <HI>Spring|field</HI> Church, will not their being an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> do it? It &s;eems the Mini&s;ters in this County are a&s;&s;o|ciated; and will any countenance the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield</HI> in a Rebellion again&s;t the A&s;&s;ociation? And becau&s;e we find &s;uch frequent mention in their <HI>Narrative</HI> of their <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> its <HI>Meeting, Breaking up, Committee, Votes</HI> and <HI>Doings,</HI> we would here, (think|ing it may be as proper a Place as any) &s;peak our
<PB N="5" REF="003996_0007_10037405B978DC30">Thoughts about tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies of Mini&s;ters which are now call'd A&s;&s;ociations. And in a Word, We don't look upon them to be any Part of the Con&s;ti|tution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Churches; for we can't find &s;o much as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> our Platform of Di&s;cipline, or the Re&s;ult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ynods, nor in the Laws of the Pro|vince. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> therefore account them to be voluntary Meetings of Mini&s;ters by mutual Agreement among&s;t them&s;elves; and whether any Per&s;on or Society will refer them&s;elves to them for Advice or not, and how far they will be directed thereby, is perfectly free and voluntary. We make no Que&s;tion but Mini&s;ters have as good a Right to meet together at one ano|thers Hou&s;es, as other People; and if when they are &s;o met, any ask their Advice upon any particular Ca&s;e, they have without Doubt a Right to give it. And &s;uch Interviews at &s;tated Times, duely manag'd, may be many Ways &s;erviceable, as they may help to promote brotherly Love, and their mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Work of the Go&s;pel. But if &s;uch a&s;&s;ociated Pa&s;tors, who&s;e Original as an A&s;&s;ociation is only from them&s;elves, come at length to look upon them|&s;elves as a &s;ort of Body Corporate, and a&s;&s;ume the Exerci&s;e of Government; if they claim a Right to take the &s;ole or the fir&s;t Cognizance of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;es within tho&s;e Bounds which they have drawn for them&s;elves, or to direct and limit Churches in the Election of Officers, and the Calling of Coun|cils; if they declare it irregular and unwarrantable in a particular Church to chu&s;e and ordain a Pa&s;tor, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting them, and having their Con|&s;ent thereto; &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation of Pa&s;tors, where|ever it is found, is an U&s;urpation upon the Liberties of Congregational Churches, and tho&s;e Churches are &s;ervile indeed that tamely &s;ubmit to them therein. And when they come <HI>ex Officio</HI> to admini&s;ter Oaths,
<PB N="6" REF="003996_0008_1003740E6D4B8908">it &s;eems al&s;o to intrench upon the Authority of the Civil Magi&s;trate. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Form of an Oath or Declaration taken by a particular Mini&s;ter, by Order of an A&s;&s;ociation, may be &s;een in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> p. 49. The fir&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e of the Kind, which has been given to the Public, and therefore worthy of &s;pecial Notice.</NOTE></P>
<P>Well; but the&s;e Gentlemen being thus oblig'd to act in the Affair of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, have heard that <HI>their Conduct has been greatly blam'd;</HI> and therefore they think <HI>nothing can be more ju&s;t, than that a true and faithful Account &s;hould be given of tho&s;e things: Their Reputation, the Cau&s;e of Truth, and the Intere&s;t of Religion calling for it.</HI> If any Account were given, it ought, to be &s;ure, to be a true and faithful one; and we heartily wi&s;h we could &s;ay theirs was &s;uch: But whether it is or not, and whether their Reputation, the Cau&s;e of Truth, and the Intere&s;t of Religion, are like to be &s;erv'd by it, mu&s;t now be left to their and our Readers to determine.</P>
<P>After the Introduction, the Performance it &s;elf is divided into two general Parts, a <HI>Narrative</HI> or <HI>hi&s;to|rical Account,</HI> and a <HI>Defence</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;onings upon the Ca&s;e;</HI> tho' they are not very careful to keep the&s;e Parts entire; for in the Hi&s;torical Account they frequent|ly intermix &s;ome Scraps of Argument, and in their Rea&s;onings upon the Ca&s;e, they again give an Ac|count of Facts. And indeed they don't appear to keep to any Order or Method thro'out their whole Book; but Things are very oddly mix'd and &s;cat|ter'd, and bro't in here and there, one would think ju&s;t as their Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion at that Time prompted and hurried them. So that to track their Foot-&s;teps by following them Page after Page, would be little better than a Goo&s;e-Cha&s;e, and carry the Reader
<PB N="7" REF="003996_0009_10037417CFD64A70">hither and thither, and back to the &s;ame Place very often; and indeed make the An&s;wer as large a Bun|dle of Confu&s;ion, as their Narrative &amp; Defence. But we hope the con&s;ideration of nothing which they offer, of any Weight or Force, thro'out their long and labour'd Piece, will be omitted, if we pur&s;ue the following Method. viz. To</P>
<P N="1">I. Make &s;ome <HI>General Remarks</HI> upon the <HI>Hi&s;torical Part</HI> of their Performance, or the Account they give of Facts.</P>
<P N="2">II. Examine tho&s;e <HI>Arguments</HI> they make U&s;e of in their <HI>Defence,</HI> which concern the Merits of the Cau&s;e in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P N="3">III. Give an An&s;wer to the <HI>Charges</HI> which they make upon the Council in general, and &s;ome Mem|bers of it in particular, to bring an odious Imputa|tion upon them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Gratifie the Oppo&s;ing Gentlemen of <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> them&s;elves, in their earne&s;t and repeated Reque&s;t, <HI>That we would let them know wherein they are to be charg'd with U&s;urpation, Injuriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. And,</P>
<P N="5">V. Let the World know the <HI>Grounds</HI> upon which we proceeded to the Ordination of Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> to the Pa&s;toral Office in the Fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> and upon what <HI>Principles</HI> we think it is to be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the Fir&s;t Place we would make a few ju&s;t <HI>Remarks</HI> upon what may be called the <HI>Hi&s;torical Part</HI> of their Book, or the Account they give of Facts. And they are the&s;e which follow,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="003996_0010_10037422012749C0">
(I.) Things are multiplied and repeated in a Manner that is very unnece&s;&s;ary, and to a Degree that is perfectly trouble&s;om and nau&s;eous. The Charges again&s;t Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; come over and over in different Parts of their Narrative. Te&s;timonies to the &s;ame Things, are not only multiplied, but the Te&s;timonies of the very &s;ame Per&s;ons, to the &s;ame Things, at the &s;ame Times, are repeated. After they have publi&s;h'd the Evidences &s;ent to them as an A&s;&s;o|ciation, they mu&s;t needs bring in tho&s;e that were given to the Council; tho' they relate to the &s;ame Matters, and did not at all belong to their Proceed|ings, which they call their Book a Defence of. Six or &s;even Times are &s;carcely enough to bring in Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s &s;aying, <HI>one Man lied,</HI> and he would not <HI>take another's Word for a Groat.</HI> Several Times the Reader is reminded, that one Gentleman of the Council was related to him by Marriage. And we have &s;ome of the &s;ame Stories in that Part which they call the De|fence, that we had before in the Narrative. But why mu&s;t the &s;ame Things be repeated &s;o often, and bro't in at every other Leaf almo&s;t, till the Book is &s;well'd to &s;o large a Size, and mounted to four Shillings and fix Pence Price? It is evident the Gentlemen affected Shew and Bulk, and had a good Will, and &s;trong Inclination, to magnifie Things, and lay on all the Load that ever they could. They &s;urely tho't &s;ome Things could not come over too often; for in this Way they would be likely to make the deeper Im|pre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome of their Readers; and thus they are not vain Repetitions, but &s;erve mighty well to an&s;wer the very chri&s;tian De&s;ign of their Perfor|mance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Account contains &s;everal Things very low and trifling. Among&s;t others of this Nature we might take Notice of what they tell us, (P. 32) of
<PB N="9" REF="003996_0011_1003742A79B6AC68">Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s <HI>&s;inging on a certain Sabbath the three fir&s;t Stanzas in the 35th P&s;alm.</HI>&mdash;Well; and what if he did? We &s;uppo&s;e the P&s;alm is of divine In&s;piration, and given for the U&s;e of the Church, as well as others. But if they would &s;ugge&s;t that Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; de&s;ign'd to have tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Imprecation applied in the &s;inging of them to his Opponents, and &s;o to them|&s;elves, they herein &s;eem to make them&s;elves Judges of evil Thoughts: And that which &s;poils all too is, That the P&s;alm was not of his chu&s;ing, if it was of his naming: For another Gentleman preach'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> him that Day, who de&s;ir'd Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; to ea&s;e him by praying before Sermon in the Afternoon; and Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; asking him what P&s;alm he &s;hou'd appoint to be &s;ung after Prayer, he mention'd this, becau&s;e it was agreable to the Subject he was upon. So that had the Thing been of Importance enough to have told the World of it, yet it was not &s;o much Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Act as the&s;e Gentlemen imagined.&mdash;We do not think it worth while to inform the World, (tho' we could do it) what P&s;alm was appointed to be &s;ung at a certain Lecture, upon the Receipt of that Let|ter they mention in this Page, which they made &s;o much U&s;e of then and &s;ince, and thought would have effectually an&s;wer'd their De&s;ign. Some of the Mi|ni&s;ters that were then pre&s;ent, and ob&s;erv'd the Spi|rit that was di&s;cover'd at the communicating that Letter, could not but think the P&s;alm of Triumph that was &s;ung, was cho&s;en to &s;uit the joyful Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another &s;uch pretty Tale we are entertain'd with in P. 63. There they tell us, <HI>That Mr. B&mdash; preach|ing from tho&s;e Words, Many are the Afflictions of the righ|teous, compar'd him&s;elf to David, Mordecai, and other good Men, and tho&s;e who oppos'd him to Haman,</HI> &amp;c. But tho&s;e who have perus'd the Notes of this Sermon,
<PB N="10" REF="003996_0012_1003742E9D45D1F8">know very well no &s;uch Compari&s;on was made by Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;, and that the Parallel was run only by &s;ome of the Hearers, who did not come to hear with that meek and teachable Frame of Spirit which the Go&s;pel requires. Nor did he make &s;uch a <HI>Declara|tion</HI> as they &s;peak of, and <HI>call God to Witne&s;s that be was innocent of the Things laid to his Charge.</HI> His Words are gro&s;&s;y mi&s;repre&s;ented; for he &s;aid no more than this, <HI>That God and his own Con&s;cience know his Charac|ter had been too unchri&s;tianly treated:</HI> And herein many others think with him &mdash;The telling &s;uch little Sto|ries is a plain Proof the&s;e Gentlemen were for letting nothing &s;lip, tho' of never &s;o trivial a Nature.</P>
<P>We &s;hall mention but one Thing more under this Head, and this becau&s;e they &s;eem to think it worthy of &s;pecial Notice by the Manner in which they tell it. In the 65th Page, the Reader is entertain'd with what they call <HI>a remarkable Scene</HI> that open'd upon the 5th of <HI>October;</HI> which was this, <HI>That a young Gen|tleman, now of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Order, read Mr. B&mdash;'s Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith on Hor&s;eback</HI> Which Story &s;erves to introduce this memorable Piece of Wit in the next Page, namely, <HI>That a Young Gentlemen who was pre|&s;ent at that Tran&s;action, made this Remark upon it,</HI> viz. <HI>The Old Hor&s;e &s;tood a&s;toni&s;h'd at what was doing; and if be had had the Tongue of Balaam's A&s;s, he would have reproved the Madne&s;s of the Prophet.</HI> As to the Matter of Fact refer'd to, The reading the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith on Hor&s;e-back, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to con|&s;ider that, and &s;et it in its true Light in another Place. What we intend here is only to admire the Piece of Wit it was the Occa&s;ion of; which if we &s;hould forbear to do, they that tell it might perhaps be angry with us for our Dullne&s;s. But at the &s;ame Time we can't but lament it, that they have not 
<PB N="13" REF="003996_0013_100374391C6F53D0">gratified our Curio&s;ity with the Name of this witty young Gentleman, and let the World know who this &s;prightly Genius is, lately ri&s;en up in the County of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who could with &s;o quick a Turn of Thought convert the poor <HI>Old Hor&s;e</HI> into <HI>Balaam's A&s;s.</HI> Yet we would not have them think they have all the Wits in their own County neither. If the Reader will forgive our trifling, we will &s;ee whether we can't match them with a Wit. There was a young Gentleman among&s;t us, who after he had read the <HI>Hamp&s;hire Narrative,</HI> told the Story of a certain Roman Catholic, who thinking it high Time to get Ab&s;olution from the Prie&s;t, writ down all his Sins in a great Volumn, and carried them to his Confe&s;&s;or: The Father, frightned at the Bulk of the Book, &s;a|tisfied him&s;elf with asking a few Que&s;tions, and told him, he ab&s;olv'd him from all his Sins. But &s;ays the poor Offender, <HI>What Penance do you impo&s;e?</HI> The Confe&s;&s;or, after a Pau&s;e,&mdash;an&s;wers, <HI>You mu&s;t read your own Book &s;everal Times a Day for a whole Month.</HI></P>
<P>We might point out &s;everal other &s;uch low &amp; little Matters as help to &s;well their Book; but it an't worth while: for we know they don't tend to the main Point; and we ask the Readers Pardon for tho&s;e we have &s;topt at. Only we can't help expre&s;|&s;ing our &s;elves &s;omething &s;urpriz d, to &s;ee a Combi|nation of &s;o many able Heads and Pens, to convey &s;uch trivial Matters as the&s;e into the World! Who would have believed it, if they had not told us they were WRITTEN BY THEMSELVES. But what is &s;till wor&s;e, Their Account contains</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Several Things that di&s;cover an evil and bitter, an uncharitable and unchri&s;tian Tem|per and Spirit. Such a Spirit &s;ufficiently di&s;|covers it &s;elf in many Pa&s;&s;ages of their Book, and
<PB N="14" REF="003996_0014_100374420BEF2918">in diver&s;e of the Stories they tell of the Coun|cil, and of particular Per&s;ons belonging to it, which if they had more of Truth in them, yet don't enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e, and the whole De&s;ign of them mu&s;t be only to fix, as far as they could do it, a Mark of Di&s;honour &amp; Di&s;grace, where they would have it worn. Pa&s;&s;ing here tho&s;e which concern others, we will mention only what relates to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; him&s;elf. Sometimes indeed they pretend a Tenderne&s;s for his Character: And we are told of one Gentleman in particular, <HI>That caution'd the People of S&mdash; to be careful in this Re&s;pect, and endeavour'd to make them &s;en&s;ible how injurious it was to receive and &s;pread Reports th it tended to bla&s;t his Reputation.</HI> And of another, <HI>Who when he let two or three of Mr. B&mdash;'s principal Friends know of the Objections that lay again&s;t him; de&s;ir'd them for the pre&s;ent not to &s;peak of them.</HI> Yet it &s;eems they &s;o far forgot their own Cautions, that as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; left <HI>Spring|field</HI> the fir&s;t Time, they let the Papers from <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> go about the Pari&s;h, when he was not there to make any An&s;wer for him&s;elf. And now, that his Reputation, and therein his Serviceablene&s;s, may be the more effectually de&s;troy'd, they in their Narrative fall upon his Morals as well as Princi|ples; and frequently in&s;inuate as if his Conver&s;a|tion was as bad as they had repre&s;ented his Opi|nions to be. He is &s;poken of in P. 43, as charge|able with <HI>&s;everal Immoralities.</HI> Yet the only one they fa&s;ten upon, (not out of Tenderne&s;s &s;ure!) is one committed when he was a Boy of about 13 Years of Age, while he was at the College; that he then <HI>&s;tole Books.</HI> And for Fear the Truth of the Story &s;hould be que&s;tion'd, they take Care to direct all that de&s;ire to have it confirm'd, to inquire of &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons: Tho', it may be, not one of their Readers has been at the Pains to make the Inquiry,
<PB N="15" REF="003996_0015_1003744CF8449638">and &s;o they might have &s;av'd them&s;elves the Trou|ble of this <HI>Adverti&s;ement.</HI> But what can be more cruel and barbarous, more contrary to Humanity as well as Chri&s;tianity, than to publi&s;h &s;uch a Thing at this Time of Day, which the World knew no|thing of before; which was cover'd in the Time of it by the Per&s;ons injur'd by it, by the Governours of the College who never animadverted upon him for it, and by a good and laudable Conduct after|wards. To fetch &s;uch a Thing up out of Oblivion, and publi&s;h it in a Way that will perpetuate the Remembrance of it to Per&s;ons and Times that are yet to come; &mdash; What a Spirit does this di&s;cover?</P>
<P>But probably it will be &s;aid, The Rea&s;on of publi&s;h|ing this Story is, to &s;hew that he is &s;till defective in Point of Veracity; for he <HI>denied it to Mr. Clap:</HI> And this is One of the Immoralities referr'd to. &mdash; Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s An&s;wer to this, as he gave it to the Gen|tlemen of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> we have in the 25th and 26th Pages of their Narrative. He there &s;ays, <HI>That the Report, as Mr. Clap gave it, being partly fal&s;e, he thought he might con&s;i&s;tent with Truth deny it. For tho' he did take the Books, yet he was not expell'd the College for it, as the Report was: Nor was he &s;o much as call'd to an Account for it by the Governours of the College.</HI> This was true in Fact; and was confirm'd to us by one of the Gentlemen of the Council, who was at that Time one of the Tutors of the College. Yet it might have been better, if Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; had, with|out Re&s;erve or Di&s;gui&s;e, let Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> have known how the Thing was: but no Wonder if he was put into a <HI>Surpri&s;e</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> upon &s;uch a <HI>&s;udden</HI> and <HI>unexpected Que&s;tion;</HI> and had not the Command of his Tho'ts at that Time. Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; him&s;elf after|ward thought this would have been more prudent: And therefore in his Letter to Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash; has the&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="003996_0016_10037457D8B2B930">Words, (P. 20.) "<HI>You having had &s;ome Occa&s;ion to think I was wanting to the Truth, in the An&s;wer I gave you to your Enquiry concerning the former Immorality you hcard I was guilty of, I do blame my &s;elf for it, and wi&s;h I had &s;poken more plainly: But what I meant then, as I have often declar'd, was only this, That the Report you gave me was not wholly true. And &s;o far as I have in any of the&s;e Things, or in my Di&s;cour&s;e with you upon the Account of them, been faulty, I ask chri&s;tian Forgive|ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c." Yet neither this, nor the An&s;wer he gave to him afterwards, when he put the Que&s;tion to him, <HI>Whether there was no Foundation upon which People could build &s;uch a Story?</HI> viz. <HI>That he went to College very young, and that his Conduct was not as it ought to be: But that he hop'd God had given him a Sight and Sen&s;e of his Sins, and that be was truly hum|bled upon the Account of them:</HI> We &s;ay, neither the Blame he takes to him&s;elf in his Letter, nor &s;uch an An&s;wer as this, tho' &s;poken <HI>with Tears,</HI> could prevail upon them to forbear the Publication of &s;uch a Story. If this is to be tender, &s;ome Mens tender Mercies are Cruelty.</P>
<P>Tho', as we have ju&s;t &s;aid, it might have been more prudent in Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;, to have an&s;wer'd Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash; in a plain and unre&s;erv'd Manner; yet, 'tis certain, Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash; had no Right to &s;uch an An|&s;wer; for it was a Que&s;tion he had no Right to put: And in &s;uch a Ca&s;e a Man may lawfully give an eva&s;ive An&s;wer that is con&s;i&s;tent with Truth. The Que&s;tion was evidently un&s;ea&s;onable and im|pertinent, to &s;ay the lea&s;t. To what Purpo&s;e could Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash; &s;o &s;ollicitou&s;ly inquire into this Matter now? Allow it to be true, and it could not di&s;|qualifie him for the Mini&s;try. Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash; knew, or might have known, he had long &s;ince been re|ceiv'd into the Communion of the Church in <HI>Cam|bridge:</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="003996_0017_1003745C3290BF78">A public Te&s;timony that his after Conver&s;ati|on was blamele&s;s.&mdash;But, perhaps it may be &s;aid, Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash;made the Inquiry with a charitable Hope the Story was not true, &amp; a kind De&s;ign to contradict it when he heard it mention'd. Whether it was ju&s;t &s;o or not, there is &s;ome Rea&s;on to doubt, when he could write to a Mini&s;ter in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> (not one of the Coun|cil) to de&s;ire him to make Inquiry into Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Conduct and Behaviour when he was at the Col|lege, and &s;end him an Account of what he could furni&s;h him&s;elf with: But the Gentleman in his An&s;wer de&s;ir'd to be excus'd from &s;o unchri&s;tian a Part, and told him, <HI>He tho't the Que&s;tion was not how Mr. B&mdash; carried him&s;elf when he was a Boy at College, but what his Conver&s;ation had been &s;ince be became a Profe&s;&s;or of Religion, and a Candidate for the Mini&s;try.</HI> Now that this has been laudable in the Opinion of the Governours of the College, what follows is ano|ther Te&s;timony. A pious &amp; charitable Gentlewo|man deceas'd a few Years &s;ince, left 60 Pounds per Annum, to be given to two Candidates for the Mi|ni&s;try, who were &s;ober, diligent, and gave good Hopes of their future Serviceablene&s;s, to encourage them to continue at College and pro&s;ecute their Studies there; to be di&s;pos'd of by the Over&s;eers of the College: And the Over&s;eers referring it to the Rev. Pre&s;ident, with the re&s;t of the Corpora|tion, to nominate two Candidates to them, thus qualified to receive the Donation, Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; was one of the Candidates, &s;o nominated and pre&s;en|ted to the Over&s;eers by the Corporation: And this was ju&s;t at the Time of his going to <HI>Springfield.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; did deny this &s;ame Story in the Manner he did, it may, all Circum&s;tances con|fider'd, be better for the&s;e Gentlemen not to in&s;i&s;t too &s;trongly on his being defective in Point of Ve|racity on this Account. For if to deny a Thing

The good Brother who carried up the Letter before-mention'd from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and by who&s;e Means the Contents of it were &s;pread about <HI>Spring|field,</HI> before it reach'd where it was directed; when the Gentleman who &s;ent that Letter, wrote to him about his doing &s;o, he received from him the following An&s;wer, viz. <HI>"I would inform you that the Account you have of your Letter being put into the Hands of a mean Per&s;on, who carried it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, is a Mi&s;take. For I did not give a Copy of it to any Body, or let any Body ever &s;o much as read it, or take it out of my Hands. But we have many wrong Repre&s;entations made, in order to make us odious abroad. I pray God not to lay to their Charge their injuring me."</HI> Here, tho' we give full Credit to him, and believe he &s;ays <HI>no|thing but the Truth</HI> about it; yet we don't believe he tells <HI>the whole Truth.</HI> While he &s;ays he did not give a Copy of it, nor let any Body &s;o much as read it, or take it out of his hands, he takes a prudent Care not to &s;ay that <HI>he did not read it to any &s;uch Per|&s;on,</HI> and &s;o put it into his <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Mouth,</HI> tho' not into his <HI>Hands;</HI> which was a much more di&s;advan|tageous Way of <HI>carrying it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e,</HI> than if the Letter it &s;elf had been &s;o carried; for we may be &s;ure it lo&s;t nothing by its thus running, if it did not grow: And yet, we believe, this Gentleman and his Friends, would think it hard, if, for this, his Veracity &s;hould be call'd in Que&s;tion. We will add but one Remark more upon their Account of Facts; and this is</P>
<P N="4">(4.) That it abounds with Mi&s;repre&s;entations and Untruths. This may &s;eem a hard Reflection con|&s;idering
<PB N="19" REF="003996_0019_1003746EDBE9F348">who&s;e Names it appears in; but is not more hard than ju&s;t. As to &s;ome of the&s;e Things, their Hast and Warmth, very probably, carried them be|yond their Evidence. This &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e particularly, when to evidence that the Mini&s;ters that came from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> were prejudiced in Favour of Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;, they &s;ay (p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">3.) <HI>they had before join'd in giving him a Certificate of his Orthodoxy;</HI> when in Fact but one of them &s;ign'd it. From whence we may conclude they ventur'd to &s;ay this, before ever they had &s;een the Te&s;timonial. Indeed this is made an <HI>Erratum</HI> at the latter End of the Book, and &s;tands corrected; but, if we mi&s;take not, it was done by a Gentleman at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that look'd over that Half-Sheet before it was work'd off: And 'tis Pity but &s;ome knowing and faithful Friend, had done them the Kindne&s;s to correct &s;ome other more important <HI>Errata</HI> for them; e&s;pecially tho&s;e in which 'tis dif|ficult to excu&s;e them from a wilfull Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion of Matters; as will appear when we come to &s;et them in their true Light in their proper Places. Having made the&s;e General Remarks on their Ac|count of Facts, we proceed</P>
<P N="2">II. To examine the <HI>Arguments</HI> they make u&s;e of in their <HI>Defence,</HI> which do enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e in Di&s;pute between us.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;approving Gentlemen have <HI>freely declar'd it to be their Minds, that tho&s;e Elders and Me&s;&s;engers of Churches that met at Springfield, and took upon them to &s;it there as Judges in Mr. Breck's Ca&s;e, were not regularly call'd thereto, and that they meddled with an Affair that did not belong to them, and that their Proceedings were very irregular and di&s;orderly.</HI> P. 77. This is freely declar'd, tis true; but it becomes them to be &s;ome|thing mode&s;t as well as free in their Declaration,
<PB N="20" REF="003996_0020_1003747C193B07B8">&s;ince the Repre&s;entative Body of the Country have declar'd their Minds the other Way: For the Ho|nourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, after a long Hearing of the Ca&s;e, came into a Vote, <HI>That the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Council conven'd at Springfield at the Call of the fir&s;t Church there, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the regular carrying on the Ordination of Mr. Robert Breck, was a regular Council.</HI> But the&s;e Gentlemen think they have very weighty Rea&s;ons to &s;upport them in the contrary Opinion and Declaration; and they are the following Ones, which we will e'en take in the Order in which they offer them.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Becau&s;e the prevailing Part of the Council was not of neighbouring Churches, but fetch'd from very remote Parts of the Country; in Neglect of the Churches of the Neighbourhood, and in Oppo&s;ition to the Body of neigh|bouring Mini&s;ters.</HI> But the prevailing Part of the Council, as it was call'd by the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> did not con&s;i&s;t of Churches that were &s;o remote from them. Of the <HI>Eight Churches</HI> which the Church in <HI>Springfield</HI> applied to upon this Oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>Four of them</HI> were in that County: If one of them would not come, and by this Means the major Part of the Churches that conven'd were not of the County, it is owing only to the Failure of that Church; and is not to be imputed to <HI>Springfield</HI> Church, nor to the Council. If the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wil|liams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> could but have been prevailed up|on to have come with his Church, as he was ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ir'd &amp; entreated, they would not have had it to &s;ay, That the prevailing Part of the Council came from remote Parts.</P>
<P>But if the major Part of the Council were not of what <HI>they call</HI> neighbouring Churches; was it not a regular, nor &s;o much as a valid Council becau&s;e of
<PB N="21" REF="003996_0021_100358D0EEA05EF0">this? Are Churches in the calling of Councils li|mited to the Vicinity, &s;o that it is an Irregularity and Offence in them, if they don't take the next neighbouring Churches, and no other? This is what the&s;e Gentlemen a&s;&s;ert; and they deliver it not only as their own Opinion, but &s;ay <HI>it was evidently the Mind of the Compo&s;ers of the Platform: For they when they direct to, or mention any Application to be made by a particular Church to other Churches, from Time to Time &s;pecifie neighbour Churches. In the 15th Chapter of the Platform, concerning the Communion of Churches, there is mention made &s;everal Times of Councils of neighbour Churches; and no mention of any other; yea, the Platform is wholly a Stranger to any Councils, but what are made up of neighbour Churches: Why don't the Platform &s;ay barely Councils of Churches? Why does it add &s;uch limi|ting Expre&s;&s;ions from Time to Time, unle&s;s it be a Direc|tion to Churches where to go for Councils?</HI></P>
<P>It is likely the&s;e Gentlemen have, upon this Oc|ca&s;ion, been rous'd up to look into the Platform; yet 'tis plain they have not read it with a due Care and Attention: if they had they would never have a&s;|&s;erted, That <HI>as often as it directs a particular Church to apply to other Churches, it &s;pecifies neighbour Churches;</HI> nor have ask'd, <HI>Why don't the Platform barely &s;ay Coun|cils of Churches? Why does it add &s;uch limiting Expre&s;|&s;ions from Time to Time?</HI> The good Gentlemen have been in too great a Haft; if they would &s;top a lit|tle, and &s;edately con&s;ult the Platform a &s;econd Time, they would find it often and often mentions barely Councils of Churches, without adding &s;uch a Li|mitation as they &s;peak of: If they would look a|gain into that 15th Chapter, concerning the Com|munion of Churches, which they quote, they will find it begins with declaring, <HI>That ALL the Churches ought to pre&s;erve Communion one with another, becau&s;e they are ALL united unto Chri&s;t, not only as a My&s;tical,
<PB N="22" REF="003996_0022_10037483F5AE9590">but as a Political Head, whence is derived a Communion &s;uitable thereunto.</HI> It then goes on to mention the &s;everal Ways in which Communion of Churches is to be exercis'd, One of which is <HI>by way of Con&s;ulta|tion one with another, when they have Occa&s;ion for the Judgment and Coun&s;el of OTHER CHURCHES, touch|ing any Per&s;on or Cau&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. And it adds a little af|ter, If a particular Church in Ca&s;e of <HI>Divi&s;ion or Scandal, refu&s;e to con&s;ult with OTHER CHURCHES, it is matter of ju&s;t Offence,</HI> &amp;c. In the&s;e Places it <HI>barely mentions other Churches,</HI> without any the lea&s;t Re&s;triction. We might turn to many more &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, but one &s;hall &s;uffic&egrave;, which comes neare&s;t to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: In the 9th Chapter, concern|ing <HI>Ordination, and Impo&s;ition of Hands,</HI> having a&s;&s;er|ted the ordaining as well as electing Power with which every particular Church is ve&s;ted, by &s;aying, Sect. 4. <HI>In &s;uch Churches where there are no Elders, Im|po&s;ition of Hands may be perform'd by &s;ome of the Bre|thren, orderly cho&s;en by the Church thereunto;</HI> It adds in Sect. 5, <HI>Neverthele&s;s, in Churches where there are no Elders, and the Church &s;o de&s;ire, we &s;ee not why Im|po&s;ition of Hands may not be perform'd by the Elders of OTHER CHURCHES.</HI> It is &s;aid here <HI>other Churches</HI> at large, and not neighbour Churches; &s;uch as the Church who&s;e Officer is to be ordain'd &s;hall chu&s;e and de&s;ire to perform that Service; and without &s;uch a De&s;ire, we pre&s;ume the Elders of the very next Church can't claim any Right to act in the Affair.</P>
<P>It is true, mention is &s;ometimes made of <HI>neigh|bour Churches;</HI> but, by comparing one Place with another, we can't &s;uppo&s;e that the Compilers of the Platform always meant by <HI>neighbour Churches,</HI> tho&s;e that were &s;ituated next to one another; but Churches in Communion with one another, by pro|fe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel, &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="003996_0023_1003748BE4B54B08">&s;ituated as that they could and would afford A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to one another, as the &s;ame &s;hould be needed and de&s;ir'd. To be &s;ure they never meant to con|fine a particular Church in calling a Council, to &s;uch a Circle as a County or an A&s;&s;ociation; for this would be to de&s;troy the Congregational Scheme, and to make the Government of our Churches not Congregational, but Cla&s;&s;ical; whereas the Plat|form declares, Chap. 2. Sect. 5. <HI>That the Government of the Church &s;ince the Coming of Chri&s;t, is not National, Provincial nor Cla&s;&s;ical, but Congregational only:</HI> If there|fore the Platform is con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, it mu&s;t leave the Communion of Churches in the &s;everal Acts and Ways of it, more at large than the&s;e Gen|tlemen would have it to be. Agreably the <HI>Synod,</HI> in 1662, In An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion propounded to them by the General Court, viz. <HI>Whether according to the Word of God there ought to be a Con&s;ociation of Churches, and what &s;hould be the Manner of it?</HI> Having &s;aid, That <HI>one Act of Communion of Churches, is to &s;eek and accept Help from, and give Help to each other, in Matters of more than ordinary Importance, &s;uch as Ordi|nation of Elders, and in doubtful and difficult Que&s;tions and Controver&s;ies, doctrinal or practical, that may ari&s;e,</HI> goes on to &s;ay, <HI>'Tho' in this there &s;hould be &s;pecial Re|ference to tho&s;e Churches, which are planted in a conve|venient Vicinity; yet there &s;hould be LIBERTY WITH|OUT OFFENCE TO MAKE USE OF OTHERS, as the Nature of the Ca&s;e, and the Advantage of Oppor|tunity, may lead thereto.</HI> And a particular Church is the &s;ole Judge, when their Ca&s;e leads them to make U&s;e of others. The Mind of our Fathers upon this Point is certainly be&s;t known by their Practice: Now it has been the Cu&s;tom of the Churches in the Country from the Beginning, to exerci&s;e this Liberty in calling of Councils, to apply to other Churches according to their own Di&s;cretion, with|out
<PB N="24" REF="003996_0024_100374914DDEC418">being confin'd to Churches of &s;uch a Circle or Divi&s;ion. This has been the Practice particularly in Ordinations; on which Occa&s;ions, as well as o|ther, Churches at a remote Di&s;tance, and even in other Provinces, do, to this Day, exerci&s;e Comu|nion with one another; and never was any Offence taken at it till now.</P>
<P>And this has been pleaded for, as the Right of Congregational Churches, by &s;uch as have wrote in Defence of their Way of Government; and &s;ome who much better knew the Mind of the Compo&s;ers of the Platform than the&s;e Gentlemen. The lear|ned &amp; venerable Doctor <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;|qui&s;ition concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils,</HI> p. 31, 32. en|ters his <HI>vehement Di&s;&s;ent</HI> from a Propo&s;al that carries in it &s;uch a Limitation as this; and &s;ays, <HI>"Churches who&s;e Ca&s;e calls for a Council, ought not to have their Li|berties infringed."</HI>&mdash;So that upon the whole we can't but think the&s;e Gentlemen have mi&s;taken the Sen&s;e of the Platform, and the Mind of the Compo&s;ers of it, as well as of the <HI>Legi&s;lators of the Province:</HI> For as our Platform of Di&s;cipline has been approv'd and recommended by the General Court, we can't but &s;uppo&s;e when they mention neighbouring Churches in any of the Laws, it is to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e who are &s;uch in the Sen&s;e of the Platform. The Legi&s;|lative Authority has taken Care to e&s;tabli&s;h the Li|berty of the Churches to them in the fulle&s;t &amp; lar|ge&s;t Manner, and not in the lea&s;t wi&s;e to curtail them. In the pre&s;ent Act for the Support and Set|tlement of Mini&s;ters, it is declar'd in the&s;e Words, <HI>"The re&s;pective Churches in the &s;everal Towns within this Province, &s;hall at all Times hereafter, u&s;e, exerci&s;e and enjoy all their Privileges and Freedoms re&s;pecting di|vine Wor&s;hip, Church Order, and Di&s;cipline; and &s;hall be encourag'd in the regular and peaceable Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice thereof.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003996_0025_10037492D4C375D0">
But if neither the Platform, nor the Province Law, has con&s;tituted them the Judges in this Ca&s;e, they think they have a higher Claim that what is founded on either of the&s;e. <HI>PROVIDENCE,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>has a&s;&s;ign'd it to us, by placing the religious State of our Neighbourhood under our View, and by making us by our Situation mo&s;t capable of under&s;tanding it, and of ad|vi&s;ing and acting upon it.</HI> But we think other Things mu&s;t concur with their Situation, before they can found their claim in Providence. The Affair mu&s;t be put into their Hands, by tho&s;e nextly concern'd, (i. e. by the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> it &s;elf) or by &s;ome &s;uperiour lawful Authority, before they can &s;ay <HI>Providence</HI> has a&s;&s;ign'd it to them; notwith&s;tanding their Situation may be very convenient.</P>
<P>They go on to &s;ay, <HI>Be&s;ides, it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, that wherein other Churches are concern'd, it &s;hould be neighbouring Churches; becau&s;e next to the Church it &s;elf, the Intere&s;t of neighbour Churches is concern'd.</HI> If this is ordinarily proper and fitting, yet it is not ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, nor always rea&s;onable. It is very po&s;&s;ible neighbouring Churches may have differing Apprehen&s;ions in Points of Order and Government from a particular Church in the Neighbourhood; and in &s;uch a Ca&s;e &s;hou'd not a particular Church be at their Liberty, to apply to &s;uch Churches as mo&s;t agree with them in Principles? It is al&s;o very po&s;&s;ible the neare&s;t Churches, or the Pa&s;tors of them, may be prejudiced, or pre-ingaged, in a Controver|&s;y that calls for the Judgment of other Churches. And it is more than po&s;&s;ible the Body of Pa&s;tors in an A&s;&s;ociation, or Neighbourhood, may be related to one another; and it may be ob&s;erv'd of them, that they commonly hang together, and are all af|fected or di&s;affected, to a Per&s;on or Bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;ome particular Ones among them are.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003996_0026_1003749702BC6C98">
But where it is on &s;ome Accounts mo&s;t fitting that neighbouring Churches &s;hould be employ'd, mu&s;t <HI>all</HI> be apply'd to that call them&s;elves neighbour Churches? And if any of them are not apply'd to, is there Occa&s;ion given them to cry out of their being <HI>injur'd,</HI> or <HI>denied their Rights?</HI> The Church in <HI>Spring|field</HI> did upon this Occa&s;ion apply to neighbouring Churches, and three of them came and concur'd in the Ordination; and the &s;econd Mini&s;ter in Age in their own County pre&s;ided in it, and gave the Charge, as another of them did the Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip. Yet the&s;e Gentlemen will &s;ay, It was done in <HI>Neglect of the Churches of the Neighbourbood,</HI> becau&s;e their particular Churches were not applied to.</P>
<P>But they complain of &s;omething more than a bare Neglect, that it was done <HI>in Oppo&s;ition to the Body of neighbouring Mini&s;ters.</HI> It is true their A&s;&s;ociation was divided upon Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Ca&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ted, (as one of the&s;e Gentlemen inform'd us,) of thirteen; and &s;even of them were again&s;t the Church's Pro|ceeding to his Settlement. So that at be&s;t Things lay among them at &s;ixs and &s;evens. But had there been a greater Union among&s;t them&s;elves, unle&s;s this Body of Mini&s;ters had the Right of Juri&s;dicti|on over the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> their meer Oppo&s;ition ought not to prevail to &s;top the Pro|ceedings of the Church, or of the Council: And this their Right of Juri&s;diction is &s;till to be made out, notwith&s;tanding all they here &s;ay to &s;up|port their Claim of it.</P>
<P>Was the Claim of the&s;e Gentlemen to be allow'd, &amp; their Scheme of Government once &s;uffer'd to take Place in the Country, the Churches would have lit|tle but the Name of their Liberties left unto them.
<PB N="27" REF="003996_0027_1003749C87BCC620">What they a&s;&s;ert, &amp; contend for, is plainly this, <HI>That the Judgment of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;es, which are bro't out of a particular Church to other Churches, belongs to neighbour|ing Mini&s;ters and Churches, and to THEM ONLY:</HI> Other Mini&s;ters and Churches that live out of the Vicinity mu&s;t not be &s;o much as join'd with them in any Ca&s;e; this is to <HI>intermeddle in their Affairs.</HI> They by their Situation are be&s;t able to judge, and &s;o Providence has a&s;&s;ign'd it to them; to them therefore it mu&s;t be bro't, and by them it mu&s;t be i&s;&s;u'd; and there don't &s;eem &s;o much as an Appeal to be allow'd. This is evidently the Scheme by their whole Talk under this Head. And a fine Scheme it is to fetter and en&s;lave the Churches; and have Things carried according to the Will, Hu|mour, Prejudice, or arbitrary Di&s;po&s;ition of a par|ticular Set of Mini&s;ters. Where did they get this Scheme of Government? And by what Name &s;hall it be call'd? It differs as much from the Presbyterian as it does from the Congregational. The Govern|ment in the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> compar'd with this, is a Government of Liberty: For they are very far from thus confining Things within the Circle of a Neighbourhood. If a Difficulty ari&s;es among <HI>them</HI> about &s;ettling a vacant Congregation, tho' that Presbytery fir&s;t judges upon the Ca&s;e; yet if either Party does not like their Judgment, they may ap|peal to the Synod, made up of &s;ix or ten Presbyterys from &s;everal Countys; and if they like not their Determination, they may from them appeal to the General A&s;&s;embly of that Church. But as our Con|&s;titution has not &s;uch Appeals belonging to it, it is the more unrea&s;onable and dangerous to confine Church Affairs to &s;uch a narrow Circle.</P>

<P>This Committee, upon their Application to the neighbouring Mini&s;ters, according to the foregoing Votes, had the following Advice given them, viz.</P>
<P>Upon Con&s;ideration of the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Robert Breck,</HI> repre&s;ented to us in &s;ome Letters from <HI>Wind|ham</HI> and <HI>Norwich,</HI> we think it advi&s;eable that the People of <HI>Springfield</HI> do no farther make their Ap|plication to him.

<P>Tho' the foregoing Advice was produc'd in their Meeting, yet the Precinct went into a Vote to invite Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> to preach the Word of God to them in order to Settlement. P. 14.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> upon Application made to him returns to <HI>Springfield,</HI> and &s;ome Time after the Pari&s;h &s;ends to the A&s;&s;ociation which met there <HI>April</HI> 1735, <Q>That they would plea&s;e to let them know, Whe|ther there was any ju&s;t Impediment to his being &s;ettled with them in the Work of the Mini&s;try, and in Ca&s;e there was, What Methods were pro|per for the removing of it.</Q></P>
<P>The A&s;&s;ociation gave this Advice, <Q>That the Matters objected again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> by Mr. <HI>Clap</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="003996_0031_100374ACEAB93D98">and others, &s;hould be fully heard and determin'd by a Committee of the A&s;&s;ociation, either here or in the County of <HI>Windham,</HI> (i.e. by <HI>Windham</HI> A&s;&s;ociation.) And voted, That the Rev.

<P>This is all that was done by the People; and yet the Gentlemen will have it that the People did <HI>of their own Accord put the Matter into their Hands;</HI> and &s;o they go on to argue very notably, That <HI>if they put the Ca&s;e into their Hands of their own Accord, then they could not regularly take it out of their Hands; and if they could not regularly take it out of their Hands, they could not regularly put it into other Hands;</HI> when no|thing can be plainer from their own Account, than this, That after they had of their own Accord ta|ken the Ca&s;e into their Hands, and had it there a long Time, the People of <HI>Springfield</HI> only &s;ent to them to be inform'd what the Impediment in the Way of Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Settlement was, and what Me|thods they would advi&s;e to for the Removal of them.</P>
<P>The Method which the A&s;&s;ociation advis'd to for the Removal of the Difficulties, viz. to have the Matter heard and determin'd by <HI>Windham</HI> A&s;|&s;ociation, or by that Committee of their own which they had cho&s;en, the People of <HI>Springfield</HI> thought they had &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons not to comply with: And their not complying with this Advice, is re|pre&s;ented as a Thing very di&s;orderly &amp; irregular. Nay they carry the Matter further, and &s;ay, That as it was irregular not to comply with the Advice of the A&s;&s;ociation to have the Matter heard by
<PB N="32" REF="003996_0032_100358E46FC21AD0">their Committee, &s;o, if the Matter had been heard by them, and they had given their Judgment upon it, it would not have been regular in them to have acted again&s;t it. The Argument here is &s;o plea&s;ant that we will give it the Reader in their own Words, by tran&s;cribing the whole Paragraph that contains it, in P. 82. <HI>If we &s;uppo&s;e it to be in their Power to refer it to whom they would, yet certainly it was a di&s;or|derly Thing for them to take it out of the Hands of the A&s;&s;ociation, after they them&s;elves had of their own Ac|cord put it into them, before ever they had had any Oppor|tunity to give their Judgment in the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it was before they had Opportunity to hear Mr. Breck and the Wit|ne&s;&s;es face to face; and that for no other Rea&s;on but be|cau&s;e they in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch a Hearing before they gave their Judgments. If the A&s;&s;ociation had given their Judg|ment, and their Judgment had not &s;uited them, it would not have been regular in them, after they had referr'd it to their Judgment, to have acted without any kind of Regard to it, meerly becau&s;e they did not judge that Way that they would have had them; becau&s;e this would be nothing but Confu&s;ion; they would herein have been incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; there is a gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity in their referring the Matter to our Judgment and Advice, unle&s;s it was to be directed; the very Notion of asking Advice is to ask others Judgment to be directed, but it is impo&s;&s;ible and &s;elf-contradictory that any one &s;hould ask judgment to be directed, that is already fully determined, that let the Judgment be which Way it will, he will go no other Way than this; but it was yet more di&s;orderly to take the Ca&s;e out of the Hands of the A&s;&s;ociation, after they them|&s;elves had put into their Hands, before ever they had Op|portunity to make any Judgment. And if it was irre|gularly taken out of their Hands, it could never be regu|larly in any other Hands.</HI> What can be finer! It mu&s;t be put into their Hands, they told us be|fore, it properly belong'd to them, and none el&s;e;
<PB N="33" REF="003996_0033_100374B02C868770">for by Rea&s;on of their Situation, and other Cir|cum&s;tances, they were be&s;t able to judge in it: Be|ing put into their Hands, it mu&s;t not be taken out till they have given their final Judgment; &amp; when they have given it, it mu&s;t not be di&s;regarded or receded from: No! This would be irregular, and bring Confu&s;ion; and tis ab&s;urd to ask Advice, unle&s;s it be to be directed; for the very Notion of asking Advice, is to ask others Judgment to be di|rected. But, <HI>Dear Sirs!</HI> to be <HI>directed,</HI> how? Any otherwi&s;e than to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making a Judgment for them&s;elves? We think there is <HI>a gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity</HI> in calling of it <HI>Advice,</HI> &amp; yet making it to be bind|ing and obligatory; and that the <HI>very Notion of ask|ing Advice,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es a Capacity and Right in them that ask it to judge at la&s;t for them&s;elves. If it mu&s;t be follow'd, however un&s;uitable in the Judg|ment of tho&s;e to whom it is given, pray don't call it <HI>Advice,</HI> but by its proper Name, <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Com|mand.</HI> But if to ask Advice of an A&s;&s;ociation, does thus take away the Right of private Judgment, they that value their own Liberty, or (to u&s;e your own Words, when you a&s;&s;ert your own Right to judge for your &s;elves, p. 68.) think them&s;elves <HI>Partakers with the Re&s;t of their Species of the Nature of rational Creatures,</HI> will be very cautious how they ask any Advice of them.</P>
<P>But let us now &s;ee whether the Church in <HI>Spring|field,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> had not &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for not complying with the Advice of the A&s;&s;ociation, to have the Matter heard and determined by the Committee afore&s;aid. There were &s;ix Reverend Gentlemen put upon this Committee; Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> objected again&s;t one of them, namely. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Long-Meadow,</HI> as a Per&s;on prejudic'd; and pray'd the Fayour of his being taken off, and then he
<PB N="34" REF="003996_0034_100358E8F800CAC0">&s;hould be free to leave the Matter to the Judg|ment of the other five: And, that his Reque&s;t might be the more readily complied with, added, that the Committee at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ted of an even Number, which was not look'd upon convenient in &s;uch Ca&s;es; and as the Committee was large, one might well enough be &s;par'd. But Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> it &s;eems, was not willing to exclude him&s;elf, and &s;o the A&s;&s;ociation were not willing to exclude him; and it was &s;aid, It was not fit Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;hould dic|tate to the A&s;&s;ociation: tho' to remedy the Incon|venience of an even Number, another Gentleman was added, but one tho't to be very far from being favourably di&s;pos'd to Mr. <HI>Breck;</HI> and &s;o the Com|mittee con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even, which was the major Part of the whole A&s;&s;ociation; &mdash; and they had as good have re&s;olv'd them&s;elves into a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e. This was certainly an unrea|&s;onable Piece of Stiffne&s;s in the A&s;&s;ociation; and it does not excu&s;e the Matter for them to &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> objected again&s;t Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> as a prejudiced Per&s;on, <HI>but without offering any Rea&s;on.</HI> That was Rea&s;on eno'; it was &s;ufficient to &s;ay he look'd up|on him prejudic'd. Upon this Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> ought immediately to have excus'd him&s;elf, and all other Judicatures would have taken him off. This gave Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> little Rea&s;on to expect much Favour from the&s;e Gentlemen in their after Managements: Therefore he made another Reque&s;t to the Mode|rator of the A&s;&s;ociation, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> that he might have Liberty to join two or three Gentlemen from abroad with them: and tho' <HI>He</HI> might con&s;ent to it, as they &s;ay he did, p. 29. yet others did not; and their mentioning of it in &s;uch a way as looks as if it was con|ceeded to, becau&s;e he con&s;ented to it, when o|thers did not con&s;ent, is a Kind of Fallacy, and
<PB N="35" REF="003996_0035_100374BC9D1D6650">tends to impo&s;e upon the World: For when the &s;ame Propo&s;al was afterwards made by others, in Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Name, and at his De&s;ire, we know &s;everal of the&s;e Gentlemen manife&s;ted their Di&s;like of it, and would not give their Con&s;ent.

If we con&s;ult the Platform upon this, we &s;hall find it puts the calling of a Council when there is need of one upon any Occa&s;ion, into the Hands of the Church, and not of a Party di&s;&s;atisfied with the Proceedings of a Church. And the Law of the Pro|vince does the fame: For if there happens a Diffe|rence at any Time between the Church &amp; the Inhabi|tants about the Call &amp; Settlement of a Mini&s;ter, &s;o as that the Inhabitants do not concur with the Choice of the Church, the Law &s;ays the Church may call a Council of Churches to hear the Rea&s;ons of their Di&s;&s;atisfaction, and if the Council judge them not to be &s;ufficient, the Mini&s;ter the Church has cho&s;en &s;hall be accounted the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h. In|deed the Ca&s;e of <HI>Springfield</HI> happily differs in this, That the Inhabitants concur with the Church in the Choice of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> by a very great Majority; and therefore we only mention the Law of the Pro|vince in this Ca&s;e, to &s;hew that the Right &amp; Power to call a Council, when there are a Number di&s;&s;en|ting from the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, is lodg'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and not with a di&s;&s;atisfied Party, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> very large.

<PB N="38" REF="003996_0038_100374CF793BDEE8">Ca&s;e to chu&s;e all the Judges, then the Rights of congrega|tional Churches are built on the Ruins of the common Rights of Mankind; and if &s;o they &s;tand upon but a very poor Foundation.</HI> But we think this is to argue very weakly and fal&s;ly; for it is agreable to the common Rights of Mankind as united in So|cieties, that the Majority &s;hould rule. And as the&s;e di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren had an equal Vote with every other Member of the Society, both in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, and in the Choice of the Ordination Council, there is no Foundation for the Complaint of their being denied the com|mon Rights of Mankind. They had indeed <HI>a Right to have their Objections and Complaints fairly beard</HI> by the Council which the Church had call'd; and therefore the Church &s;ea&s;onably pa&s;s'd a Vote, and &s;ent it to them, wherein was &s;ignified that they might have Opportunity to offer their Objections again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Settlement, the Day before that which was appointed for Ordination, to the Coun|cil they expected would then convene: And to do this they had all the Opportunity and Liberty that could be, given them by the Council. And it was further offer'd to them in an Interview which the Brethren of the Church had with their di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren, about a Fortnight or three Weeks before the Council met the &s;econd Time, that they might have the Liberty to join a Number of other Churches to them; but they would not accept the Offer, without a Council intirely new was called, and the Churches which the Church had applied to were &s;et a&s;ide. But if this be the Right of one or two di&s;&s;enting Brethren in a Church, we think it is built on the Ruins of the common Rights of Societies.</P>

[5.] Their fifth Rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e <HI>the major Part of the Council was cho&s;en by Mr. Breck him&s;elf, and 'tis contrary to the Light and Sen&s;e of all Mankind, that a Man &s;hould chu&s;e his own Judges, becau&s;e this is in Effect to give him Liberty to chu&s;e his own Judgment.</HI> It is true that the Church gave Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> Liberty to nomi|nate &s;ome of the Churches they &s;hould apply to; but not the major Part; and this is no more than is given to all Candidates.

<P>At a Meeting of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> regularly met <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4. 1735. <HI>Luke Hitchcock</HI> 2d cho&s;en Clerk.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Voted</HI> to chu&s;e Elders for to ordain the wor|thy Mr. <HI>Robert Breck,</HI> viz. The Rev.

<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>John Burt</HI> cho&s;en to go to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> as a Me&s;&s;enger to the Elders that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;hall chu&s;e to ordain him.</P></Q>
<P>The Church had not at this Time a Pa&s;tor at their Head, but were left to manage for them|&s;elves as well as they could, and &s;o their Votes are not drawn up in &s;o methodical and ex|pre&s;&s;ive a Manner, as they might have been; ne|verthele&s;s the true Intent and Meaning of them is very plain to any one that has a Mind to under|&s;tand them, and no De&s;ign to pervert them. The Church regularly met to vote upon Affairs re&s;pec|ting the Ordination; they cho&s;e four of the El|ders, that with their Churches, they de&s;ir'd might a&s;&s;i&s;t; thinking the Churches were &s;ufficiently di&s;|tingui&s;hed by naming their Elders; than which nothing is more common: And as for &s;ending to Elders without their Churches, it never entred into their Hearts. The naming the other four was left with Mr. <HI>Breck.</HI> And they cho&s;e a Committee to
<PB N="43" REF="003996_0043_100374E9B1CDDCD8">manage the Affairs re&s;pecting the Ordination; and one nece&s;&s;ary Affair for which they were cho&s;en, was to &s;ign Letters to the &s;everal Churches of which the&s;e Elders were the Pa&s;tors. And becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e Elders liv'd at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they cho&s;e another of their Number to be their Me&s;&s;enger to carry the Letters to them This is the plain State of the Ca&s;e, and this was the true Intent and Meaning of the Church, as they afterwards declar'd in a Body. For when the Coun|cil met at <HI>Springfield,</HI> it was &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that truly they were never applied to by <HI>Spring|field Church:</HI> Therefore at a Meeting of the Church by Adjournment the next Day, we thought it pro|per to inquire of them, Whether the Letters we had receiv'd came from that Church, and the Committee that &s;ign'd them in their Name were appointed and authoriz'd by them &s;o to do? And they univer&s;ally an&s;wer'd in the Affirmative. This the Gentlemen have repre&s;ented in P. 89, as our being <HI>accepted</HI> as a Council after our coming up to <HI>Springfield</HI> by a Vote of the Church, to &s;upply the Defect of their not &s;ending to us. And in the 88th Page, having &s;aid, That <HI>the Act of the Churches of Bo&s;ton and Sud|bury in chu&s;ing of Delegates to a&s;&s;i&s;t in or daining an Officer in Springfield Church, was null and void, becau&s;e they had never been applied to by Springfield Church,</HI> they go on to argue, <HI>and if that Act was null and void when done, the Vote of Springfield Church that was pa&s;&s;ed after|wards, could not make it valid;</HI> when in Truth no Vote of this Nature was pa&s;s'd, or ask'd for, or &s;o much as thought of: There was only a plain Que&s;|tion ask'd the Church, to which they returned an An&s;wer. It is therefore a very fal&s;e Repre&s;entation which they make of this Matter, and they have herein impos'd upon the World, &amp; abus'd both the Church and the Council; but it is not the fir&s;t nor the la&s;t Time of their doing &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="003996_0044_100374F242E87DD8">
They go on in their Argument again&s;t the Regu|larity of the Council, and &s;eem to think it encrea&s;es in Strength as it does in Length: To cut us all up by the Roots at once, they &s;ay, <HI>Indeed not only that Part of the Council that came from Bo&s;ton and Sudbury were not regularly call'd according to congregational Prin|ciples, but neither that Part that belong'd to this County, for the Church never voted to de&s;ire the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any Church at all, or any of their Lay-Delegates, and voted for none but certain Presbyters by Name; the Church did nothing that by congregational Principles they had any Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, which was to de&s;ire the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Churches, and did not only that which they had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, (viz.) chu&s;e particular Per&s;ons out of other Churches to a&s;&s;i&s;t, which by congregational Principles belonged not to them, but to tho&s;e other Churches they belonged to. So that by congregational Principles all they did was null, and THERE WAS NOT ONE SOUL OF THAT COUNCIL HAD ANT BUSINESS THERE accor|ding to the Platform, but their being there was in Oppo|&s;ition to it.</HI> The whole Weight of this &s;welling Argument re&s;ts upon this, that only Elders are men|tion'd in the Church's Votes; tho' there is not any Que&s;tion to be made, but they intended the Chur|ches of which they were the Elders, and in their Letters tho&s;e Churches were addre&s;s'd to &s;end their Elders and other Delegates. The Gentlemen are very welcome to any Advantage they can make from &s;o mean a Cavil, which none but the lowe&s;t Sort of Di&s;putants would make U&s;e of&mdash;But &s;up|po&s;ing <HI>Springfield</HI> Church had only de&s;ir'd the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of certain Elders by Name, and tho&s;e El|ders had, with the Con&s;ent of their Churches, come to them, and carried on the Ordination, being &s;a|tisfied as to the Man's Qualifications for the Mi|ni&s;try, to &s;ay that this is contrary to congregatio|nal Principles, and according to tho&s;e Principles
<PB N="45" REF="003996_0045_100374F60124B1B0">is null and void, di&s;covers they have no thorough Acquaintance with tho&s;e Principles they pretend to judge upon. The Platform in the Chapter of Ordination, Sect. 5, &s;ays, <HI>The Impo&s;ition of Hands may be performed by the Elders of other Churches, if the Church who&s;e Officer is to be ordained &s;o de&s;ire.</HI> And the Synod of 1662, &s;peaking of the Communion of Chur|ches, &s;ays it is exercis'd by <HI>making U&s;e occa&s;ionally of Elders, or able Brethren of other Churches, or by the more &s;olemn Meetings of both Elders and Me&s;&s;engers in le&s;&s;er or greater Councils, as the Matter &s;hall require.</HI> But it may be the Gentleman who thus lays about him to invalidate the <HI>Springfield</HI> Ordination, had be&s;t not &s;trike too furiou&s;ly, le&s;t the Blows &s;hould reverbe|rate upon him&s;elf; For, if we have been rightly inform'd, only certain Elders by Name were invited to carry on his own Ordination, and the&s;e never &s;o much as cho&s;en by the Church he was ordain'd to; tho' we don't &s;u&s;pect he has any De&s;ign to in|validate his own Ordination, and we have &s;uch a Re&s;pect both for the Per&s;on and Mini&s;try of this Brother, that we would not go about to invalidate it neither, tho' it were only upon congregational Principles.</P>
<P>There is another Argument the&s;e Gentlemen make much U&s;e of, tho' it does not &s;tand di&s;tinctly by it &s;elf, but &s;eems rather to run thro' their whole Performance, and to be interwoven with almo&s;t e|very &s;ingle Argument, viz. That <HI>the Method taken by Springfield Church, and their Council, makes void all Endeavours any Mini&s;ters can u&s;e to hinder the &s;ettling of heterodox Mini&s;ters, and to prevent the Growth of Error in the Country. &mdash; That we have opened a Door for the letting in of Error,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and this at a Time when they ap|prehend the State of the Land requires that the Care that is taken in &s;uch Ca&s;es be not &s;lighty, but thorough and ef|fectual.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="003996_0046_100374FA64AC65B0">We have, perhaps, as good Opportunity to know the State of the Land, (i. e. of the Churches in the Land,) as them&s;elves; &amp; we are as apprehen|&s;ive as they are, that it requires that the Care that is taken in the Settlement of Mini&s;ters re&s;pecting their Orthodoxy, &s;hould be not &s;lighty, but as tho|rough &amp; effectual as may be. But from the Know|ledge that we have of the State of the Land, we are fully per&s;waded the Care of Councils re&s;pecting this Matter, is likely to be as thorough and effec|tual as that of A&s;&s;ociations. In this Way Purity of Doctrine has been pre&s;erv'd in the&s;e Churches, for more than a hundred Years: And if future Coun|cils will take as much Care in this Re&s;pect, as the <HI>Springfield</HI> Council has done, we hope there will yet be Truth in our Day; tho' whether our Care has been &s;lighty or thorough, the Reader will not be able to judge, till we come to &s;hew the Grounds up|on which we proceeded, which will be done in its proper Place. But our propo&s;ed Method leads us in the next Place,</P>
<P N="3">III. To reply to tho&s;e Things with which they <HI>charge the Council</HI> in general, or &s;ome <HI>particular Mem|bers</HI> of it, to bring an <HI>Odium</HI> upon them.</P>

<P>In one Place 'tis &s;ugge&s;ted as if we had given Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> our Promi&s;e to come and ordain him; and for this they bring in the Rev. Mr. <HI>Allis</HI> as a Voucher. They &s;ay, P. 33, 34. <HI>The Rev. Mr. Allis, coming di|rectly from Mr. Breck, told &s;ome of us, that Mr. Breck intended it &s;hould not be known, what Churches out of the County &s;hould be &s;ent to, till the Letters to call them were actually gone. And Mr. Allis added, There was no

In a Letter to one of us, dated <HI>April</HI> 5, 1736, he &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e are to inform you that what is produc'd in the Narrative, as an Argument to prove that you <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Mini&s;ters were prejudiced in the Affair of Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Ord nation, and were not fit to fit as Judges in the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e as they &s;ay, I told them <HI>that Mr. B&mdash; intended it &s;hould not be known what Churches out of the County &s;hould be &s;ent to, till the Letters to call them were actually gone; and that there was no doubt but he would be ordain'd, for he had got &s;ome Gentlemen's Promi&s;e that they would come and ordain him,</HI> is not &s;o; for up|on the &s;tricte&s;t Recollection in the World, I can't remember any &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ion, and have told the Gentlemen &s;ince they mu&s;t needs be mi&s;taken, and then repeated to them what I did &s;ay, which was va&s;tly different from what they repre&s;ent.</Q> To be &s;ure the Sugge&s;tion, let it come from whom it will, is groundle&s;s and fal&s;e. We now &s;olemnly declare Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; had never any &s;uch Promi&s;e from us; but on the contrary, we, (&s;ome of us at lea&s;t) took Occa&s;ion once and again to &s;ay to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; him&s;elf, and tho&s;e that bro't the Letters to us, that if we &s;hould go up, they mu&s;t not think we came re&s;olv'd to carry on an Ordination, but to hear and judge of what might be objected, and if there was not full Satisfaction given as to Principles, we &s;hould never lay our Hands on him. That we &s;pake to this Purpo&s;e to them, they them|&s;elves openly declar'd, upon an Appeal which we made to them, before the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="003996_0048_10037506E19F19F8">

But they have hereby doubly abus'd Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> and ba&s;ely mi&s;repre&s;ented his Letter; the De&s;ign of which was not to ask the Con&s;ent of any of them, to his coming up upon a Council, if the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> &s;hould apply to the Church of which he was a Pa&s;tor, and his Church &s;hould vote to &s;end; No; Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> never thought their Con&s;ent at all needful to that; But it was at Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s De&s;ire, and in his Name, to make the Motion which he him|&s;elf had made before, but did not think complied with, tho' they once &amp; again &s;peak as if it was, viz. that when the Objections again&s;t him from <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> were further heard in the A&s;&s;ociation, he might be allow'd to have two or three Mini&s;ters from a|broad pre&s;ent, to hear tho&s;e Matters, and to u&s;e their good Offices as far as might be proper for them, to get the Difficulties remov'd, for the greater Sa|tisfaction, both of the People of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Breck.</HI> Their Con&s;ent to this Propo&s;al was needful; and this is all that the Letter refers to. And if this Motion had been con&s;ented to at this Time, on the Part of tho&s;e Gentlemen, it may be the greate&s;t Difficulties had been remov'd, and the Things that follow'd prevented.

<P>When Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> came to us with a Reque&s;t that we would take him under &s;uch an Examination, it was immediately objected to him, That as he had been preaching at <HI>Springfield,</HI> and had a Call to Settlement in that Place, it was much more proper for him to be examin'd by the Rev. A&s;&s;ociation there, than by the Mini&s;ters here: That tho&s;e Gentlemen might think we had taken an Affair upon us, that did not immedi|ately concern us, and &s;o it might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;gu&s;t them, and prejudice him. To which he an&s;wer'd, "That tho' he had a Call to <HI>Springfield</HI> his Settlement there was at pre&s;ent Matter of Uncertainty; and he had once already refus'd their Invi|tation. That if he did finally &s;ettle there, he did not &s;up|po&s;e this wou'd &s;et a&s;ide his Examination by tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, and that he &s;hould be free and ready to be examin'd by them al&s;o, if they de&s;ir'd it. But there having been Reports con|cerning him in other Places, as a Per&s;on of Heterodox Prin|ciples, particularly at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Marlborough,</HI> (which &s;ome of us knew to be true, tho' we had no Rea&s;on to think them well grounded) he tho't it concern'd him to endeavour to &s;e|cure his Character in the&s;e Parts; and that this wou'd be bet|ter
<PB N="50" REF="003996_0050_100359210F91BBA8">done by an Examination here, than at any other Place." So after &s;ome delay we proceeded, and gave him a Te&s;timo|nial which we tho't proper. It is true, Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> did not ac|quaint us with the Difficulties re&s;pecting him in your A&s;&s;o|ciation: Nor do I &s;ee how the&s;e Matters in di&s;pute are <HI>touch'd</HI> by what we have done. For our Te&s;timonial only re&s;pects his Orthodoxy, as it appear'd to us upon an Examination at his own Reque&s;t; nor is it &s;uited to &s;erve him at <HI>Springfield</HI> any more than any other Place in the Province. If indeed Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;hould make u&s;e of it to &s;uperceed any Examination into his Principles, you might think proper to make previous to an Ordination, he would &s;o far deal unfairly and fal&s;ely with us.</P>
<P>It is much to be de&s;ir'd, that the happy Harmony which has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the Mini&s;ters and Churches in your County, by which the Intere&s;ts of Religion have no doubt been greatly &s;erv'd, &s;hould be continued, and no Breach made upon it, e&s;pecially at a Time wherein &s;uch a remarkable Work of God is carrying on among you, for which we here give Thanks to Heaven, and pray that nothing may be permitted to interrupt or blemi&s;h it; and therefore that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Settlement at <HI>Springfield</HI> &s;hould be to the Satisfaction of neigh|bour Pa&s;tors. But I find Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> him&s;elf ready to think &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions have been made upon <HI>&s;ome</HI> of tho&s;e Gentle|men to his Di&s;advantage, that they, as Things are now cir|cum&s;tanc'd, can't be deem'd equal Judges in his Ca&s;e. He al&s;o thinks if any thing &s;hould be determin'd not in his Fa|vour, the People would not be likely to re&s;t &s;atisfied with it, if they alone were the Judges. It is therefore his pre&s;ent Intention (as I under&s;tand from him&s;elf) to ask them &s;o far to Favour him, as to give him Liberty to invite two or three other Mi|&s;ters, to give their Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when his Affairs are further proceeded in: And in Ca&s;e this Motion is accep|ted, he reque&s;ts me to be one of them.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> tho' it would be very plea&s;ant to me to vi&s;it my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in your Part of the Province, and it is what I have long had a De&s;ire to do, and &s;hould choo&s;e this remarkable Time above any, yet I cannot think of coming upon this Occa&s;ion, without con&s;ulting tho&s;e who are more nearly related to the Affair. I therefore humbly Reque&s;t you to give your &s;elf the Trouble to write me your Thoughts upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="003996_0051_10037512E36D7D10">
As to Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> him&s;elf, tho' I heartily wi&s;h his U&s;efulne&s;s, and entertain good Hopes concerning him, yet I have no par|ticular Intere&s;t in him, and know of nothing to give me an undue Bya&s;s towards him: And I hope no one will appear upon this Occa&s;ion to oblige Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> or gratifie the Peo|ple, to the Damage of Religion, Peace, and good Order, or to the <HI>ju&s;t Grief and Offence</HI> of neighbour Pa&s;tors.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear your advanced Age is &s;o comfortable to your &s;elf, and profitable to the Church of Chri&s;t; and pray God &s;till to prolong your u&s;eful Life. I beg your candid In|terpretation of my writing on this Affair, and ask your Ble&s;&s;ing and Prayers for</P>

<P>I Have received your's relating to the Affair of Mr. <HI>Breck;</HI> wherein you &s;igni&s;ie a De&s;ire to vi&s;it our Parts of the Country. I &s;hould greatly rejoice to &s;ee you here, and I doubt not you would be welcome to my Brethren in the Mini&s;try here. But I am not con&s;cious of any unfairne&s;s or unfriend|line&s;s towards him, as to the Matters that have been objec|ted again&s;t him, nor any per&s;onal Prejudice again&s;t him in any of us, that &s;hould render us unmeet Judges in his Ca&s;e, as he &s;ugge&s;ts. It is probable that he and the People of <HI>Spring|field</HI> will U&s;e their Liberty in conducting their Affairs as they have done.

<P>The Gentlemen carry on their Charge of Prejudice re&s;pecting tho&s;e of the Council particularly that came from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;ay, P. 90, 91. <HI>It evidently appear'd in their acting when they came, contrary to what they gave Rea&s;on to expect; who a&s;&s;ur'd the Rev. Doctor Colman, as he inform'd us in a Letter directed to the Rev. Mr. Williams of Hatfield, that when they came they would before they proceeded vi&s;it us, and not act without us, much le&s;s again&s;t us; but yet when they came never con&s;ulted with us, but acted intirely without us, yea, contrary to our Prote&s;tation &mdash;. Indeed they propo&s;ed that the A&s;&s;o|ciation &s;hould be call'd together at Springfield when they came up, to give them their Rea&s;ons, &amp;c. But this in
<PB N="53" REF="003996_0053_100375204FA30D40">our Judgment would have made an odd Appearance, for our A&s;&s;ociation to be call'd together from all Parts of the County, to appear before them, to give an Account of our &s;elves to them, &s;ubmitting our Conduct, as well as Mr. Breck's Ca&s;e. to their Judgment.</HI> This Paragraph contains a complicated Charge, in which there is a Complication of vile Mi&s;repre&s;entations: We call them &s;o, becau&s;e they can be no other than willful ones.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the Charge is, That when we came to <HI>Springfield</HI> we never con&s;ulted them, but acted intirely without them. This Charge, accor|ding to Cu&s;tom, is made two or three Times over. We had it before, P. 79, where they &s;ay, <HI>We have the more Rea&s;on to complain that in an Affair wherein our Intere&s;t is &s;o much concerned, and their's &s;o little, they would re&s;olutely proceed, without giving any Heed to our earne&s;t Remon&s;trances, and &s;tand aloof from us when they came into the County, and never &s;o much as friendly in|quire of us, or give us any fair Opportunity to &s;peak for our &s;elves.</HI> When the Truth of the Ca&s;e is, they &s;tood aloof from us, and would not give us that Opportunity to confer and con&s;ult with them, which we earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd and reque&s;ted them to favour us with, in a Joint-Letter which we wrote to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield.</HI> This Rev. Gentleman, after the Letters from <HI>Springfield</HI> Church had been read in our Churches, and they had voted to &s;end, and appointed their Me&s;&s;engers, writes a Letter to Doctor <HI>Colman,</HI> the Contents of which he de&s;ir'd might be communicated to the other Pa&s;tors of the Churches &s;ent to; in which he has &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age as this; "I can't but take it &s;omething hardly that upon Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s bare Word, they &s;hould think &s;o meanly of us, as to count it nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;end their Mini&s;ters and Delegates to inter|po&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="003996_0054_1003752420193190">in that Affair". And afterwards asks, "Are not our Churches got too deep into Contentions already?" This occa&s;ion'd our Writing to him the following (as we thought, re&s;pectful) Letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. <HI>William Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter to the Rev. Doctor <HI>Colman</HI> has been com|municated to us, the other Pa&s;tors of the Churches in this Town, applied to by the Church in <HI>Springfield</HI> to come up to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Ordination of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> whom they have cho&s;en to be their Pa&s;tor. Their Letters mi&s;&s;ive had been before communicated to our &s;everal Churches, who had with much Unanimity voted to an&s;wer the De&s;ire of that Church, by &s;ending their Elders and Me&s;&s;engers upon the Occa&s;ion. But it is Matter of Concern and Grief to us that this Step &s;hould give any Grief or Offence to your &s;elf, or any other of our Fathers and Brethren in the Mini&s;try with you. We can't think the Affair ju&s;tly &s;tated, when we are repre&s;ented as co|ming up <HI>upon Mr. Breck's bare Word to interpo&s;e</HI> in an Affair that don't belong to us, without taking the lea&s;t Notice of the Call we have from the Church mo&s;t nearly concerned in the Affair. Nor can we think our coming up, as &s;o called and &s;ent, ca&s;ts a Reflection upon the Mini&s;ters of your County, as if they were <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> or <HI>unfaithful;</HI> but mu&s;t declare again&s;t any &s;uch Interpretation of the Action as mo&s;t injurious to us, being con&s;cious to our &s;elves that we highly Honour and E&s;teem them, for their Piety, Wi&s;dom, Faithfulne&s;s, and other Endowments, as well as for the Honour God does them in &s;o owning them in his Work, as he has done formerly and of late. The Act of Communion which the Church at <HI>Spring|field</HI> asks us to exerci&s;e, is, as we apprehend, agreeable to the general Principles and Practice of the&s;e Churches. We are far from thinking our &s;elves nece&s;&s;ary to this Affair, any o|therwi&s;e than as we are applied to by that Church. And we hope you don't think <HI>&s;o meanly of us,</HI> as that we &s;hall be their Tools to carry on an irregular and unworthy Action. How|ever inferiour we may be to our Brethren with you, in other Re&s;pects, we hope we are equal with them in a Concern for the Purity, Peace and Order of the Churches. And could we after a mo&s;t &s;erious weighing the Matter, judge that the Ends of Peace and Edification were mo&s;t likely to be an&s;wer'd by
<PB N="55" REF="003996_0055_1003752BE20D9EF0">our &s;taying at Home, we can a&s;&s;ure yon, <HI>Sir,</HI> we &s;hould not vi&s;it you at this Time, at lea&s;t not as coming up upon this Affair. But we verily fear if the Churches &s;ent to &s;hould re|fu&s;e to come up to <HI>Springfield,</HI> becau&s;e the neighbour Mini&s;ters have de&s;ir'd they would not, it would tend to widen the Diffe|rence, inflame the Spirits of Men, and drive the Church there to &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as might give you &s;till more Grief.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible, <HI>Sir,</HI> as you are, <HI>that our Churches are already too deep in Contentions;</HI> and therefore de&s;ire there mayn't a new one ari&s;e, about the Rights of A&s;&s;ociations, and the Liberty of particular Churches in calling and ordaining their Pa&s;tors.</P>
<P>In one Thing we are obliged to &s;et Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and the Church at <HI>Springfield</HI> right in your Thoughts. You intimate a Su&s;picion that the Ordination might be purpo&s;ely &s;et at a Time when the Mini&s;ters were to be ab&s;ent at an A&s;&s;ociation Meeting at <HI>Deer|field.</HI> But we can a&s;&s;ure you the contrary. There was a Blank left in the Letters that the Time might be &s;et which would be&s;t &s;uit tho&s;e that were at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance. They that bro't the Letters were very de&s;irous it might be the Be|ginning of <HI>September,</HI> but as that did not &s;uit the Circum&s;tances of &s;ome of us, &s;o we tho't it was bringing on the Af|fair much too quick, and therefore, not without &s;ome Diffi|culty, got them to &s;et the <HI>Eighth</HI> of <HI>October</HI> for the Day. And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> the chief De&s;ign of this Letter, is to make this Re|que&s;t, if it may be granted; That your A&s;&s;ociation Meeting which was to be at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> may be at <HI>Springfield</HI> on Thur&s;day the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> at which Time we &s;hall endeavour, by the Will of God, to be up; that &s;o we may be favour'd with an Interview with the Rev. Brethren, and may receive the fulle&s;t Information of the State of the Ca&s;e we are call'd to be con|cern'd in, that we mayn't be left to act ami&s;s for want of &s;uf|ficient Light; And that there may be the Pre&s;ence of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kirtland,</HI> if it can be obtain'd, If this Mo|tion may be complied with, and all Prejudice and Re&s;entment, (if there be any Thing of them) laid a&s;ide, and a friendly Inter|view had, who can tell but it may have a good I&s;&s;ue? But if this can't be obtain'd, we neverthele&s;s hope, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t, that Your &s;elf, and the other Gentlemen of your Coun|ty that are &s;ent to, would come with their Churches, and &s;it in the Ordination Council, and hear and judge in the Affair. We cannot &s;ee, Sir, why any &s;hould refu&s;e this, becau&s;e if they are not &s;atisfied, they may refu&s;e to act if an Ordination

In the&s;e Reque&s;ts we think we have the Concurrence of the Rev. Doctor <HI>Colman,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e he will &s;o far join with us as to make them to you him&s;elf in a &s;eperate Letter. We are &s;orry for the Occa&s;ion of giving you this Trouble; and if, in any thing, we have us'd too great a Freedom with the hoary Head, which we would ri&s;e up before, we pray you to excu&s;e and forgive,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter, before it was &s;ent up, was &s;hewn to &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who have never been &s;u&s;pected to be in the lea&s;t prejudic'd in Favour of Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> or of us, who expre&s;s'd them&s;elves well pleas'd with our writing in &s;o re&s;pectful Manner, and e&s;pe|cially with our de&s;iring &s;uch an Interview with tho&s;e Mini&s;ters; it was therefore the more &s;urpri|&s;ing to us to receive &s;uch an An&s;wer from the good Gentleman him&s;elf as we did, wherein he &s;peaks of him&s;elf as <HI>ill-treated,</HI> and refu&s;es to call the A&s;&s;ocia|tion together, <HI>unle&s;s it might be left to the A&s;&s;ociation, with our &s;elves, to judge what might be objected again&s;t the Proceedings of Springfield Church.</HI> But this was not in our Power to do. We could not put the Proceedings of <HI>Springfield</HI> Church into the Hands of the A&s;&s;ociation to judge of &amp; determine. None could do this but the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> them|&s;elves, and they had before refus'd to do it. Be|&s;ides our Churches had now &s;ent us forth with o|ther Delegates, in the Way of a Council of Chur|ches; and how could we &s;et a&s;ide our Me&s;&s;engers, and join our &s;elves with the A&s;&s;ociation, in judging the Ca&s;e? All therefore that we propos'd, or could
<PB N="57" REF="003996_0057_10035933AB531850">propo&s;e, was a brotherly Interview &amp; Conference, between the Mini&s;ters of that A&s;&s;ociation, and the Mini&s;ters of the Council, to try if &s;ome of the Dif|ficulties could not be remov'd before the Council met, and way could not be made to have &s;ome o|ther of the neighbouring Churches yet &s;ent to. If we had found Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> or the Church unrea&s;ona|bly refu&s;ing what was proper for them to do on their Part, we had &s;ome Rea&s;on to hope that by our Intere&s;t in them we might have prevail'd upon them to a &s;uitable Compliance. With &s;uch Views and Hopes, and with Hearts full of Re&s;pect to our Fathers and Brethren in the Mini&s;try there, (God is our Witne&s;s!) we went up to <HI>Springfield,</HI> a Week &s;ooner than we &s;hould el&s;e have done; but found the A&s;&s;ociation would not conde&s;cend to give us the Meeting we &s;o much de&s;ir'd, tho' they had not their Meeting at <HI>Deerfield</HI> neither. But in&s;tead of meeting <HI>us,</HI> a Number of them met for &s;everal Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with the Di&s;&s;atisfied, and with the Ju&s;tices that were fetch'd down from <HI>Northampton,</HI> and there is no Room to doubt were in the Scheme to &s;top the Councils proceeding in the Affair, by that extraordinary Interpo&s;ition which every Body has heard of. And now, let any one judge, with what Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice they complain of us, that we <HI>&s;tood aloof from them, and would not con&s;ult with them.</HI> Could they imagine we &s;hould go from one Part of the County to another, to meet with them &s;ingly, when they live &s;o remote from one a|nother. Some of us, particularly Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wel&s;teed,</HI> did go to vi&s;it Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> at <HI>Long-Meadow,</HI> where they found Mr. <HI>Raynolds</HI> with him, and had con&s;iderable Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Affair. And we &s;hould with Plea&s;ure have paid our Duty at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> if we had had more Rea&s;on to think the Vi&s;it would have been well receiv'd: but as the
<PB N="58" REF="003996_0058_10037538FB5E9008">venerable Gentleman there, &s;eem'd to think him&s;elf ill treated in a Letter, drawn up in as re&s;pectful Terms as we could do it, we de&s;pair'd of his think|ing him&s;elf well treated by us in a Vi&s;it: So that Reverence, and not Want of Re&s;pect, kept us from thence. But whether it was expected we &s;hould have proceeded, and humbly vi&s;ited as far as <HI>Deer|field,</HI> we can't &s;ay.</P>
<P>We can al&s;o leave it to every Reader, of but com|mon Under&s;tanding, and the lowe&s;t Degree of Im|partiality, to &s;ay, Whether in the <HI>latter Part</HI> of this Charge, they don't treat us again in a mo&s;t unju&s;t and injurious Manner, when, for our thus reque&s;t|ing them &s;o far to favour us, as to have their A&s;&s;o|ciation Meeting at <HI>Springfield</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> that &s;o we might have an Opportunity for an <HI>In|terview</HI> and <HI>Conference</HI> with them, they repre&s;ent us as writing in an a&s;&s;uming Way, to have their A&s;&s;o|ciation call'd together, <HI>to appear before us, to give an Account of them&s;elves to us, and to &s;ubmit their own Conduct, as well as Mr. Breck's Ca&s;e, to our Judgment</HI> Is there any Thing in our Letter that gives them Occa&s;ion to &s;ay this? Can this be any other than a wilful Mi&s;repre&s;entation of us, and our Propo&s;al? And how &s;hould &s;uch Men be credited in their Re|pre&s;entation of other Matters?</P>
<P>They &s;ay farther concerning the Council, That <HI>their Prejudice evidently appear'd in the driving and vio|lence of their Proceedings, particularly when we earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd them if they would come, at lea&s;t to defer coming for &s;ome Time, and not to proceed &s;o &s;uddenly and ha&s;tily; that there might be further Opportunity for Con&s;ideration, or for things to get into a better Po&s;ture, but we were not regarded, they went violently on again&s;t all that could be &s;aid to them.</HI> How fa&s;t and violently we drove

The Church at <HI>Springfield</HI> &s;ent forth their Letters to the Churches, the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> A Blank was left in the Letters to &s;et the Time for the Council to meet, that might be&s;t &s;uit tho&s;e that liv'd at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance. The People, as we under&s;tood by tho&s;e that bro't the Letters, were de&s;irous it might be early in <HI>Septem|ber.</HI> But the Mini&s;ters at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> prevail'd to have <HI>October</HI> fix'd for the Time; &s;o that there were two Months between &s;ending out the Letters, and the Meeting of the Council: And one principal Rea|&s;on why they de&s;ir'd the Time &s;hould be put off, was, that the Affair might not be bro't on too quick, and that there might be <HI>Opportunity for Con&s;ideration, and Things to get into a better Po&s;ture.</HI> Not only this, but we went to <HI>Springfield</HI> a Week before the Time for the Se&s;&s;ion of the Council; and let the Gentle|men there know that we &s;hould do &s;o, that &s;o we might have Opportunity to confer and con&s;ult with them. The Council (i. e &s;even of the eight Churches &s;ent to) conven'd on the &s;eventh of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> in the Morning, and being form'd into a Coun|cil, let the Church, and the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren, know we were ready to hear what they had to of|fer to us. The di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren let us know they were not yet prepar'd to bring in their Objec|tions, and de&s;ir'd further Time. The Council there|fore adjourn'd to 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon; at which Time they came &amp; pre&s;ented a Paper of Char|ges &amp; Allegations again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> but declar'd they would not bring their Proofs, becau&s;e they would not &s;ubmit their Affairs to us as a Council. The next Day in the Morning the Council &s;ent to them the following Vote, <Q>That this Council expect the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren, not only to produce their Objections again&s;t the Ord nation of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> but al&s;o the Proofs and Evidences to &s;up|port
<PB N="60" REF="003996_0060_10035930876BC7C0">them: And if the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren re|fu&s;e to do &s;o, we &s;hall think it our Duty to in|quire into the Principles of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> and it we find him Orthodox, &s;hall proceed to comply with the De&s;ire of the Church in this Place.</Q> The Return was, that they &s;hould not &s;ubmit their Affairs to us However, as the Council were appriz'd that the Rev. Me&s;&s;i. <HI>Kirtland</HI> and <HI>Clap,</HI> two <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> Mini&s;ters, who were then at <HI>Springfield</HI> were the principal Per&s;ons from whom the Objections again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> came, they pa&s;s'd a Vote, and &s;ent it to tho&s;e Gentlemen, manife&s;ting it to be <Q>the earne&s;t De&s;ire of the Council, that if they knew any thing re&s;pecting the Doctrine, or Morals. or both, of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> which may di&s;qualifie him for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, they would plea&s;e to declare it freely to us.</Q> The&s;e Gentlemen, af|ter &s;ome Debate, both by Word and Writing, con|&s;ented to give us an Account of what they knew. [We were now bro't to the Day, that had been nam'd by the Church for the Ordination; but the Council told them there could then be no &s;uch Thing as an Ordination; Time mu&s;t be allow'd to hear and judge in the Ca&s;e; and whether we &s;hould ordain at all we could not yet tell; and therefore forbad their making the u&s;ual Prepara|tions for Entertainment.] When the Rev. Gen|tlemen afore&s;aid were admitted into the Council, and the Council prepar'd to hear, Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> pro|duc'd and read &s;undry large Papers referring to the Principles of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> which Papers are publi&s;h'd in the Narrative. When Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> fir&s;t began, Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> de&s;ir'd to know whether he might make An|&s;wer to Things as Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> went along, or &s;tay till he had done. The Council told him they would hear Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> out, and then he &s;hould have Op|portunity to make An&s;wer. While Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> was
<PB N="61" REF="003996_0061_1003754EB3DC8128">reading his Papers, there came a Me&s;&s;enger on Hor&s;e-back to &s;peak with him, who, having fini&s;h'd his private Me&s;&s;age to Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> rode away with convenient Speed, it is not unlikely to inform tho&s;e that &s;ent him, how to Time the next Me&s;&s;enger and Me&s;&s;age. For ju&s;t as Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> was fini&s;hing, &amp; Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was to have made An&s;wer, there came an Of|ficer with a Warrant from three <HI>Northampton</HI> Ju&s;tices who were fetch'd down to <HI>Springfield</HI> a Day or two before, to apprehend <HI>Robert Breck,</HI> Gentleman, and bring him before them, to an&s;wer to &s;uch Things as &s;hould be objected him. And Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> being apprehended, was carried into the public Town-Hou&s;e, and Proclamation being made for any in the A&s;&s;embly to te&s;tifie what they knew about the Principles &amp;c. of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> the Rev. Me&s;&s;i <HI>Clap, Kirtland,</HI> and others, appear'd as Evidences to te&s;t|fie to tho&s;e Things which they were before exhi|biting to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council. Tho' the Council look'd upon this unprecedented Proceed|ing of the Ju&s;tices, to be a direct Breach upon tho&s;e Liberties of the Churches which the Law has con|firmed to them, and they had been in the unmo|le&s;ted Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and U&s;e of to that very Day, yet they made no Oppo&s;ition to them, but on the con|trary endeavour'd to calm the Spirits of the Peo|ple, that were now put into Ferment eno'; and by their Influence kept them from any ra&s;h Ac|tion; and contented them&s;elves with &s;ending to them the following Vote by two of the Members of the Council, &s;oil. <Q>Voted by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council in this Place, That they con&s;ider it as their Duty, not only to the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Spring|field,</HI> but al&s;o to the Churches whom we repre|&s;ent, and all the Churches of Chri&s;t thro' this Province, to acquaint your Honours, that when you &s;ent your Officer to apprehend Mr. <HI>Robert
<PB N="62" REF="003996_0062_10037556021DFA18">Breck,</HI> and bring him before you, we were regu|larly and legally conven'd in Council, at the De&s;ire of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> for the regular carrying on the Ordination of &s;aid Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> according to the Order of the Go&s;pel in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and were actually hearing the Charges again&s;t the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> which your Honours have &s;een meet to take Cog|nizance of, and wre&s;t out of our Hands.</Q></P>
<P>The Ju&s;tices kept Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> from the Council till it was Night, and order'd the Officer to take Care of him till they &s;hould &s;end for him again the next Day; but upon &s;ome of the Councils giving their Word he &s;hould be forth coming when call'd for, he was admitted to go to his Lodging that Night. The Council were together early in the Morning, and endeavour'd to go on with the Hearing; but it was not long before Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was again &s;ent for by the Ju&s;tices. But Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> declar'd to the Coun|cil, he had the Day before delivered to them al|mo&s;t all that he had to offer in the Ca&s;e; and Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> &s;aid what he had to offer was much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, &amp; tended to confirm what Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> had offer'd; and that it was given to the Ju&s;tices in Writing the Day before, from whom might be had a Copy of it. The Ju&s;tices kept Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> till it was late in the Afternoon, when they &s;ign'd a Warrant to carry him to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> there to an|&s;wer for tho&s;e Things; and thither he was forth|with carried; a Number of the Church being cho|&s;en to attend him in Token of Re&s;pect, and the People giving evident Marks of their Affection to him as he went thro' the Town. &mdash; The Council while he was gone, did all they could that the Tem|per &amp; Behaviour of the People might be &s;uitable to their Circum&s;tances; &amp;, it mu&s;t be &s;aid of them, they
<PB N="63" REF="003996_0063_1003755F6D2776A8">generally carried it becoming their chri&s;tian Cha|racter. As an In&s;tance of it, A Number of the Church came, the next Morning, to the Mini&s;ters of the Council, with a De&s;ire that &s;ome Time might be &s;pent with them in extraordinary Supplications to Heaven, upon &s;o extraordinary an Occa&s;ion; to which we readily and willingly con&s;ented. It was propos'd at fir&s;t to have it with the Church in pri|vate; but finding the Inhabitants concurring with the Church in the Motion and Reque&s;t, it was a|greed to have it in Publick: Accordingly the Af|ternoon was &s;pent in Prayer in the Public Meeting Hou&s;e, with a large and weeping A&s;&s;embly; and the Word accompanied Prayer, in a &s;ea&s;onable Di&s;|cour&s;e made by one of the Mini&s;ters, from tho&s;e Words, Eph. 2. 21. <HI>In whom all the Building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Day after this Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> return'd to <HI>Spring|field;</HI> and tho' the Council, after mature Delibe|ration upon the Ca&s;e, were unanimou&s;ly of Opi|nion, that as he had given, and was &s;till ready to give, full Satisfaction about his Principles, the Ob|jections that had been made again&s;t him from <HI>Con|necticut</HI> of &s;o long &s;tanding, were no longer a Bar in the Way of his Ordination; and tho' many of the People were de&s;irous, if we had Light in our own Minds for it, that we &s;hould then proceed to or|dain; yet we tho't it be&s;t, on many Accounts, to proceed no further in the Affair at that Time: We therefore only come to a Re&s;ult, in which we gave our Opinion and Advice to the Church; and having agreed to &s;tay and keep the following Sab|bath with them, our Re&s;ult was then publickly read. The next Day we made an Adjournment; and, after &s;everal Se&s;&s;ions by Adjournment, and after
<PB N="64" REF="003996_0064_100359A69094FEC0">the Affair was determined in Favour of the Church and of the Council, &s;o far as it went in the Gene|ral Court upon the People's Complaint, the Coun|cil, after the Space of more than three Months, met again at <HI>Springfield,</HI> and finding the People did a|bide firm in their Choice of Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> and con|tinue &s;tedfa&s;t in their De&s;ires to have him ordain'd their Pa&s;tor, we did, upon what we e&s;teem'd &s;uffi|cient Satisfaction, proceed to an&s;wer their De&s;ires. &mdash; And now, Where does the <HI>driving and vio|lence,</HI> they &s;peak of, appear? We think we proceed|ed in the Affair by very &s;low and lei&s;urely Steps; and &s;hew'd much Moderation in our Councils and Managements; and that there was no other dri|ving but this, that we did not &s;tay at Home when they bid us, and &s;top as they would have had us.</P>
<P>Another Thing they complain of us for, is, that we had not a public Hearing of the Ca&s;e. Thus they ask, P. 47. <HI>Can it be tho't a proper Act of an Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Council, to bear Matters of public Scandal, in which many are greatly concern'd, in a private and hid|den Manner? As was the Ca&s;e here. If Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils, (or indeed any Judicature) acting as &s;uch, &s;hould thus conduct them&s;elves, we cannot but think that they would give the World too much Rea&s;on to think, that they had other Things in View, than Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Truth and Pence. When the Council, Witne&s;&s;es, and Accu&s;ed, were &s;ecure within the Walls of a private Chamber, the Door fa&s;t &s;hut, and latch'd upon them, the Bu&s;ine&s;s proceeded,</HI> &amp;c. That Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils always meet fir&s;t in a private Hou&s;e, and there form them&s;elves into a Council, chu&s;e a Moderator, Clerk, &amp;c. and pre|pare Matters for a public Hearing, before they go into Public, is known to all that have ever attended &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies. And the only Rea&s;on why we did not go into a public Hearing of this Ca&s;e, was becau&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="003996_0065_10037560F23AEAD0">the di&s;&s;atisfied declar'd they would not &s;ubmit their Matters to us a Council; and tho' they bro't to the Council a long Paper of Charges, or Allegations, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> yet they once and again refus'd to bring their Proofs to &s;upport them; as appears by the 46th Page of the Narrative. And when the Rev. Me&s;&s;i. <HI>Kirtland</HI> and <HI>Clap,</HI> were afterwards de|&s;ir'd to give the Council an Account of what they knew relating to Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Principles, they de|clar'd they did not come to be <HI>Accu&s;ers;</HI> they had been &s;ent for by the di&s;&s;atisfied to be <HI>Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> but now they were come they found tho&s;e that had &s;ent for them would not improve them in that Ca|pacity, becau&s;e they were determin'd not to &s;ubmit their Affairs to us as a Council; and they, for their own Parts &s;hould not put them&s;elves into the Place of Accu&s;ers, and &s;o be under Obligation them&s;elves to get Proofs and Evidences. The Council then &s;aid to them to this Purpo&s;e, 'We will not con&s;ider you in the Ca&s;e, either as Witne&s;&s;es or Accu&s;ers, but as Friends to Truth, and Per&s;ons concern'd for the Purity of the Churches, and &s;peaking only to give the Council what Light you can at their Re|que&s;t to you; and we hope, and, as far as we can, engage, that neither Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> nor his Friends, &s;hall take Advantage of what you &s;hall &s;ay, to give you any Trouble.' Then the&s;e Gentlemen de&s;ir'd the Hearing might be in public. &mdash; But the Coun|cil told them, 'There could be no Foundation for a public Hearing, unle&s;s &s;ome Per&s;ons would appear as Accu&s;ers. They them&s;elves refus'd to do that; and the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren, when they bro't in their Paper of Allegations, declar'd they would not bring their Proofs; and to arraign a Man in a pub|lic Judicature, when no one appear'd as his Accu|&s;er, &amp; when tho&s;e that pretended to exhibit Charges again&s;t him, declar'd, at the &s;ame Time, that they
<PB N="66" REF="003996_0066_1003593CF3E99CA0">would not &s;upport their Charges by evidence, was contrary to the Rules of common Ju&s;tice: But if the di&s;&s;atisfied Brethren, would let us know they were ready to &s;upport their Charges, or they them|&s;elves would be his Accu&s;ers, we were free &amp; ready to go into a public Hearing.' And herein we can't but think our Conduct will be ju&s;tified by all wi&s;e and ju&s;t Men. And as to the Door's being &s;hut, while the&s;e Reverend Gentlemen wore giving us their Account, the Weather was too cold to al|low it to &s;tand open; but it was never &s;hut to keep out any that they de&s;ir'd might be pre&s;ent. They did de&s;ire Me&s;&s;i. <HI>Stephen Williams, Hopkins, Raynolds,</HI> and <HI>Bull,</HI> and &s;ome others might be pre&s;ent, &amp; they were readily admitted. &mdash; It look'd very odd, that when the di&s;&s;atisfied refus'd to &s;ubmit the Ca&s;e to us, and the&s;e Gentlemen declin'd the Place of Accu&s;ers, a public Hearing &s;hould &s;till be &s;o pre&s;s'd for on all Sides, as it was. There is &s;ome Rea&s;on to think, there was another De&s;ign in it, be&s;ides the the endeavouring to blacken Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> all that they could. We know, (for it was prov'd before the Honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives) that a War|rant was prepar'd to apprehend that Part of the Council which did not belong to the County; and the going into public would have given a fairer Opportunity to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Warrant, and &s;ome more Colour to pro&s;ecute us for a Riot. But we can a&s;&s;ure them not the Jealou&s;y of this, but the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Inju&s;tice of the Thing, made us decline going into publick.</P>
<P>Another Thing they &s;ay, (P. 91.) that &s;hew'd the Prejudice of the Council was, <HI>their appearing Mr. Breck's Advocates, even before they came to a Re&s;ult, as one of the Delegates did openly in Court.</HI> One would think they might be a&s;ham'd to hint any thing of
<PB N="67" REF="003996_0067_10037568D511FB60">what was tran&s;acted in the Court-Hou&s;e! &mdash; But an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, and a civil Court, are very different Things: And why one Man's &s;peaking for another in a civil Proce&s;s, mu&s;t di&s;qualifie him from acting in an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affair, when that &s;ame Per&s;on is concern'd, other People will not &s;o readily apprehend as the&s;e Gentlemen do: Be&s;ides that Delegate appear'd there in Behalf of the Coun|cil, as well as Mr. <HI>Breck.</HI></P>
<P>They proceed and &s;ay, (P. 91.) <HI>Another Thing that &s;hews the Prejudice of the Council, was their cau&s;ing to be read, (as we pre&s;ume it was of their ordering, becau&s;e done &s;o publickly under their Window) on Hor&s;e-back, in the Street, in the mid&s;t of a Multitude of People, Decla|rations of certain Per&s;ons, to no other End, but to repre|&s;ent Mr. Kirtland and Mr. Clap to be Liars,</HI> &amp;c. The Hi&s;tory of this al&s;o was given before, (P. 65.) &s;ome|thing more particularly, after this Manner, <HI>Upon the Ninth of October, there was a very great Concour&s;e of People gather'd at the Hou&s;e where the Council was &s;it|ting; whether call'd together, or accidentally met, we don't pretend to determine: But can't but take Notice of a very remarkable Scene that then open'd, which was this; The People being a&s;&s;embled in great Numbers before the Door, a young Gentleman, now of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Order, di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf, by mounting a Hor&s;e, and reading off Mr. Breck's Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, (the fir&s;t po&s;&s;ibly, that ever was read on Hor&s;e-back) And that which is more &s;urpri&s;ing &s;till is, that tho' the Day before, the Evidences in Oppo&s;ition to Mr. Breck's gro&s;s Errors, mu&s;t needs be beard in a mo&s;t private Manner; yet now the Evidences to invalidate them, mu&s;t be read on Hor&s;e-back,</HI> &amp;c. We have before taken Notice of the prodigious Piece of Wit, about the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> and the <HI>A&s;s,</HI> which this &s;erves to introduce; that which we have now to &s;peak to is the Matter of Fact related. And tho'
<PB N="68" REF="003996_0068_1003756A883E2B20">the Gentlemen's Manner of Rea&s;oning here is ad|mirably &s;trong, &s;cil. <HI>It was done under their Window, therefore by their Order;</HI> yet we can a&s;&s;ure them, if they will give Credit to us, that let it be done where it would, it was not only without the Coun|cil's Order, but without their Knowledge. The Time they &s;peak of in which it was done, was the Day after Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was carried from the Council before the Ju&s;tices, and while he was with them the &s;econd Time, and they were &s;igning the War|rant to &s;end him to <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Council being now ob&s;tructed, they were adjourn'd, and the Members of it &s;catter'd, &s;ome in one Place and &s;ome in another. Two or three of them were &s;itting &amp; di&s;cour&s;ing by the Fire-&s;ide, in the Cham|ber where the Council had &s;at, and there came up one or two of the Church, &amp; &s;aid to them, 'They had heard &s;ome Evidences had been bro't to the Council, tending to invalidate &s;ome of the Evi|dences again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> had him&s;elf given in a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith; and de|fir'd they might &s;ee them.' They were an&s;wer'd, 'That if they would be patient for a Day or two, the Council would by that Time come to a Re&s;ult, and the Church would be &s;ent for in a Body, and the Council would then give them all the Light they had them&s;elves.' They &s;aid, 'They &s;uppos'd it would do no Hurt ju&s;t to take them down and read them, and they &s;hould &s;oon be return'd.' So the Per&s;on who had tho&s;e Papers in his Pocket, let them take 'em, without any Tho't of their be|ing read in &s;o publick a Manner. But, it &s;eems, as they began to read them; one and another gather'd about, and becau&s;e they that had them could not read them very readily, a young Gentleman, a Can|didate for the Mini&s;try, who happen'd to be by, was de&s;ir'd to read them; and becau&s;e more ga|ther'd
<PB N="69" REF="003996_0069_10037573DC667A30">about than could well hear, he was per&s;wade'd by &s;ome of them to get upon a Hor&s;e that hung by the Door. The Gentlemen of the Council who were &s;itting together up Stairs, perceiv'd nothing of all this, till it was ju&s;t over; probably, they would not have advis'd to the Thing in the Man|ner of it, had they known it before. However, it may be remark'd, This was nothing near &s;o public as the Tran&s;actions in the Town Hou&s;e the Day before, where all the Charges again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> were read to a much greater Multitude, and as if they were not drawn un full enough, were har|rangu'd upon, according to the be&s;t of &s;ome Men's Talent, on Purpo&s;e to blacken him the more. But if the Concern of this young Gentleman for his Friend, at &s;uch a Time as this, did carry him a Step beyond the Rules of Prudence, for the&s;e Gentlemen to publi&s;h it in &s;uch a Way as they have done, with a plain De&s;ign to bring, as far as this can do it, an <HI>Odium</HI> upon him, helps to &s;hew with what Tender|ne&s;s they u&s;e tho&s;e that do any Thing that is not plea&s;ing to them. And that which makes it &s;till look wor&s;e in them, is, that Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> and <HI>Clap,</HI> whom they &s;peak of as injur'd by it, did not mani|fe&s;t them&s;elves offended with him for it; but a Week or two after a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his Ordination. But it will not hurt the young Gentleman, with tho&s;e that know his di&s;creet, &s;ober, and ingenious Conver&s;a|tion, which &s;ome of us had Opportunity with Plea|&s;ure to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t Charge, it &s;eems, is re&s;erv'd for the la&s;t; They fini&s;h with &s;aying, (P. 92.) <HI>A|nother Thing that &s;hews the Prejudice and Violence of the Gentlemen of that Party (if tho&s;e can be called Gen|tlemen that can be guilty of &s;o &s;ordid an Act) is their intercepting and breaking open, and publi&s;hing in the Ga|zette, a private Letter of a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction to his
<PB N="70" REF="003996_0070_1003594923953508">Friend; the taking &s;uch Methods to promote their De&s;ign, will have a Tendency to render both the De&s;ign, and them that promote it, infamous in the Eyes of all wi&s;e and &s;ober Per&s;ons: Herein they have done that in the Face of the World, as glorying in it, which common KNAVES and RUFFIANS when they do, do privately, and keep &s;ecret, as being a&s;hamed of it.</HI> The Gentleman that writes this &s;eems to have his Temper pretty much rais'd, and to de&s;ire to rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions of his Rea|ders too. And we acknowledge &s;uch an Act de|&s;erves to be had in Dete&s;tation and Abhorrence. But as they relate the Story, it wants, as many of their Stories unhappily do, the needful Circum|&s;tance of Truth. We are, &s;ome of us at lea&s;t, charg'd with <HI>intercepting</HI> this Letter. But we do, every Man of us, (if they'l allow us once more to borrow &s;ome of their own Words) <HI>&s;olemnly declare, to all that will give us the Credit of Men of common Hone&s;ty &amp; Truth,</HI> that if the Letter they refer to was intercepted, we were, no manner of Way in the World, knowing of, or concern'd therein. A Copy of a certain Let|ter was bro't to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> but not one of us knows, from whom, or by whom, it came.

For the&s;e Gentlemen therefore to charge it &s;o roundly upon &s;ome of us, upon no better a Founda|tion, and with &s;uch Terms of Reproach, as they u&s;e, is very injurious Treatment, and we might ju&s;tly return their hard Words upon them; but we will only &s;ay, They may do well to con&s;ider, if it be not a Breach of the <HI>ninth Commandment,</HI> which they are obliged to teach others to ob&s;erve and keep.&mdash;

<P N="4">IV. We let them, and the World, know wherein <HI>their Conduct is to be blam'd,</HI> or they are to be charg'd with any <HI>Injuriou&s;ne&s;s, U&s;urpation, &amp;c.</HI> They be|gin their Defence with a Complaint, <HI>that we have never &s;ignified to them, what Parts of their Conduct have been Matter of Difficulty with us, or wherein we have thought it blame-worthy.</HI> And in the 73 Page they &s;ay, <HI>We have heard there is a great Cry of in&s;ufferable Tyranny in the Hamp&s;hire A&s;&s;ociation: We de&s;ire that tho&s;e that have made and promoted it, either in this Coun|ty, or el&s;ewhere, making all the Improvement they can of their own Ob&s;ervation, and all the Information they can get from any People in the County, or tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that
<PB N="74" REF="003996_0074_1003758D35116748">belong to us, that have di&s;&s;ented from us in the late Af|fair, to &s;how in any one In&s;tance wherein the A&s;&s;ociation of the Mini&s;ters of Hamp&s;hire have, in this Ca&s;e, or any other, done any Thing that has in the lea&s;t &s;avour'd of a Spirit of U&s;urpation or Tyranny, or whereby the Privilege of any Congregational Church have in the lea&s;t Degree been invaded. And is it to the Honour of them that make this Clamour, that they are the Authors of &s;o great a Noi&s;e and Uproar, again&s;t a Body of Mini&s;ters in the Country, whereof they can give no Account, of &s;hew any Ground?</HI> To gratify the&s;e Gentlemen, we will freely let them know, wherein we think their Conduct, in &s;ome Parts of it, is to be blam'd, and has more than &s;avour'd of U&s;urpation and Tyranny. But becau&s;e they have heard that they have been blam'd, in Things that we never heard them blam'd for, we will, (to do them Ju&s;tice) let them know wherein we do not lay any Blame to them.</P>
<P>We do not blame them in the lea&s;t, becau&s;e <HI>they have in &s;ome In&s;tances forborn to act as</HI> (they &s;ay) <HI>Mr. Breck, and the fir&s;t Church in Springfield, would have bad them, becau&s;e they would not act again&s;t their Judg|ments;</HI> No; &s;o far from this that we think they are to be commended &amp; honour'd for it, &amp; not blam'd. And we intirely agree with them, that their not acting again&s;t their Judgments, was <HI>&s;o far from in|vading the Rights of any Congregational Church, that whoever oppo&s;es them in it, invades their Right, not as Members or Mini&s;ters of either Congregational or Presby|terian Churches, but as Partakers with the re&s;t of their Species of the Nature of rational Creatures.</HI> But then they &s;hould be willing to allow others, who are as rational and free Creatures as them&s;elves, a Right to act according to their Judgments. We can't but think, Mr. <HI>Chauncey,</HI> Mr. <HI>Devotion,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rand,</HI> had as good a Right to act according to their Judg|ments,
<PB N="75" REF="003996_0075_10037594267A2C88">in the Affair of <HI>Springfield,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> had to forbear act|ing again&s;t their Judgments; and that to oppo&s;e them therein is <HI>to invade their Rights as Partakers with the re&s;t of their Species of the Nature of rational Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>Neither do we at all blame them, that they <HI>have, either in private Conver&s;ation, or more openly, freely de|clar'd their Opinions,</HI> about the <HI>Springfield</HI> Affair; if they have but &s;poken the Words of Truth and So|berne&s;s. We are no more <HI>aware</HI> than them&s;elves are, <HI>that either Congregational Churches or Councils, had ever a Right to oblige neighbouring Mini&s;ters to hold their Tongues, and not to dare to &s;peak their Minds about the Regularity of their Proceedings.</HI> But neither are we aware that <HI>Presbyterian Mini&s;ters</HI> have a Right to tie the Legs and Hands of <HI>Congregational Mini&s;ters,</HI> that they &s;hall not come &amp; ordain a Mini&s;ter in a Con|gregational Church, that has &s;ent to them to ex|erci&s;e &s;uch an Act of Communion with them.</P>
<P>And, that we may lay as little Blame as po&s;&s;ible upon the&s;e Brethren, we &s;ay farther, We never <HI>blam'd</HI> them, nor &s;o much as ever heard them <HI>blam'd, becau&s;e the Rev. Mr. Williams, the Rector of the College in New-Haven, was at Springfield at the Time wherein the Ordination was intended.</HI> Tho' we think the Ex|cu&s;e they make about his being there is &s;omething lame. They &s;ay, he <HI>came up a little before on a Vi&s;it to his Rev. Father at Hatfield, and was then on his Re|turn home, and came both to Hatfield, and to Springfield, without any of their Procurement; and they &s;uppo&s;e bad as much Bu&s;ine&s;s there as the greater Part of Gentlemen have that attend Ordinations, and conclude he did not think he tran&s;gre&s;s'd any Rule, or invaded any Bodies Right in going there.</HI> If neither his being there, nor
<PB N="76" REF="003996_0076_10037597DAF83878">his Conduct there, needs an Excu&s;e, why do the&s;e Gentlemen go about to make one for him? But if one is at all needed, it's Pity but they &s;hould make a better. He might, and no doubt did, make a Vi&s;it to his Rev. Father at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> but we know a great Part of his Time was &s;pent at <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Springfield,</HI> e&s;pecially the latter Place, where he was more than once, and for diver&s;e Days toge|ther, tho' it is twenty Miles from his Father's Hou&s;e at <HI>Hatfield.</HI> We can hardly think he came as other Gentlemen do to an Ordination, when the Week before, he could con&s;idently give out at <HI>Springfield,</HI> there <HI>would be no Ordination,</HI> or <HI>there &s;hould be none;</HI> and &s;ome others of <HI>Connecti|cut,</HI> that were with him there, could give out the &s;ame. It is much more likely he came to hinder the Ordination what he could, when he was with the Ju&s;tices, and the di&s;&s;atisfied for &s;o many Days to|gether. And whether he did not urge the &s;erving the Warrant upon that Part of the Council that did not belong to the County, let the Gentleman who refus'd to Con&s;ent to its being &s;erv'd, be inquir'd of. When Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was taken from the Council, into the public Town-Hou&s;e, &amp; treated after the Manner he was, did not Mr. Rector <HI>Williams</HI> &s;it there, with a &s;ingular Air of Plea&s;ure in his Countenance, to the Ob|&s;ervation of many that &s;aw him? And did he not faithfully attend at <HI>Springfield,</HI> till the Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o far over, that the Warrant was &s;ign'd to &s;end him to <HI>Connecticut?</HI> Then he rode a Way a little before, no doubt to prepare him a &s;uitable Reception in that <HI>Colony;</HI> and to do as that <HI>Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction</HI> did, who wrote the Letter from <HI>N</HI>&mdash; <HI>H</HI>&mdash; to <HI>L&mdash;g-M&mdash;d&mdash;w.</HI> Yet we fully agree with the&s;e Gentlemen, that it would look <HI>hard, if they mu&s;t be accountable for his being there,</HI> or for what he did there.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="003996_0077_1003759D649D8518">
That we think they were to <HI>blame about the Choice of the Committee of A&s;&s;ociation, to hear Mr. Breck, and the Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> we have &s;aid already. As likewi&s;e in their refu&s;ing to give us a friendly Meeting, and <HI>&s;tanding aloof from us,</HI> when we came into the Coun|ty. But e&s;pecially do we think them Blame-worthy in that they have as an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> or as <HI>County Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> &s;et up a <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> over the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Springfield,</HI> and claim'd for them&s;elves the <HI>&s;ole Cog|nizance</HI> of the Affairs of that Church, and endea|vour'd to <HI>limit, controul,</HI> and <HI>over-rule</HI> them, in their free electing and ordaining Power. Herein, we &s;ay plainly, we think they <HI>have invaded the Rights of a Congregational Church,</HI> and are chargeable with no &s;mall Degree of <HI>Injuriou&s;ne&s;s, U&s;urpation,</HI> and <HI>Ty|rany.</HI> It will doubtle&s;s be expected that we &s;hew the Ground of this Charge, and wherein it appears that the <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> Mini&s;ters have &s;o done.</P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>That the&s;e Gentlemen did, by virtue of their <HI>Si|tuation</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> take the Affair of <HI>Springfield</HI> into their Hands, without its being referr'd to them by that Church, has been already made evident from their own Narrative; and that to judge of the Proceedings of that Church in the Call and Settle|ment of their Mini&s;ter, did of Right belong to <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>them only,</HI> is what they argue and contend for, when they come to that Part which they call their Defence. See the 78th, 79th, 80th, &amp; 81&s;t Pages; out of which we have had Occa&s;ion to tran&s;cribe &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages already, and therefore &s;hall omit them here to avoid Repetitions.</P>
<P>That they endeavour'd to keep the Ca&s;e in the Hands of the A&s;&s;ociation, and bring the Church at <HI>Springfield</HI> under a Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ubmit to their Judg|ment
<PB N="78" REF="003996_0078_100375A723028E10">and Deci&s;ion, is evident from the great Pains they took to hinder the Churches &s;ent to from coming up upon the Occa&s;ion. Many Letters were wrote to this End, in which were &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e; <HI>"It is an odd Thing, that the Ca&s;e of a Can|didate, bro't before an ASSOCIATION, &s;hould be wre&s;ied out of their Hands,</HI> (Nam &s;ub judice lis erat) <HI>under a Notion of the Privilege that the Churches have to choo&s;e their own Officers, or of the Liberty to choo&s;e whom they will to ordain." &mdash; "If the Charges again&s;t Mr. Breck were heard by our whole ASSOCIATION, and be was clear'd by them, Things would be like to be ea&s;y.'&mdash; "For Gentlemen to come from di&s;tant Parts to concern them&s;elves in this Affair, OR AND THE LIKE CASE, is irregular, and not to ju&s;tified, Becau&s;e the Mini&s;ters of this County are equal to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and becau&s;e they are more knowing in and better acquainted with the Ca&s;e, and therefore more fit to be the Judges." &mdash;</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;till more evident from their Conduct after the Churches &s;ent to did convene at <HI>Springfield:</HI> par|ticularly by that <HI>formal Prote&s;tation</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Narrative, P. 38, 39, 40.</NOTE> &s;ent in again&s;t the Councils proceeding at all to act in the Affair, &s;ign'd by &s;ix of them, (to which another has &s;ince given his Concurrence) &s;ome of whom live about forty Miles from <HI>Springfield;</HI> in which Prote&s;tation they plainly claim the Church at <HI>Springfield</HI> as be|longing to their <HI>Dioce&s;s,</HI> by telling us our coming up there, was properly, <HI>allotrio epi&s;copine,</HI> to play the Bi&s;hop in another Man's Charge.</P>
<P>But that the Powers of the A&s;&s;ociation might be in the mo&s;t effectual Manner &s;upported, and the Church of <HI>Springfield</HI> at la&s;t compell'd to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their Juri&s;diction, the Help of &s;ome
<PB N="79" REF="003996_0079_100375AB30D311B8">Ju&s;tices was call'd in; and after tho&s;e Gentlemen, in an Interview with the Council, had let us know that they did not think it proper that other Mi|ni&s;ters and Churches &s;hould be concern'd in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs of that County, there was a Warrant drawn and &s;ign'd, to apprehend that Part of the Council, that did not belong to the County of <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> And, if we are rightly inform'd, no|thing hindred the prepared Warrant's being actually &s;erv'd, but the Prudence of one of the three Ju&s;tices, who after it was &s;ign'd, grew diffident in his own Mind a out the Step they were going to take, and &s;o would not con&s;ent to have it &s;erv'd. By this Means it was that the Mea&s;ures were turn'd, from the Council, upon Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> and another Warrant was &s;uddenly drawn and &s;ign'd to apprehend him; which was accordingly executed. &mdash; And if we &s;ay, that the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> A&s;&s;ociation, a con&s;iderable Number of them at lea&s;t, were acce&s;|&s;ary to this Interpo&s;ition of the Ju&s;tices, it is no groundle&s;s Surmi&s;e. If they were not the Per&s;ons that complain'd to the Ju&s;tices, or went to fetch them down to <HI>Springfield,</HI> yet, we know that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Long-Meadow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Raynolds,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> with a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinc|tion from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> came to <HI>Springfield</HI> when the Ju&s;tices did, and were in <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> if not in <HI>Con|&s;uit,</HI> with them, and the di&s;&s;atisfied Party, from Day to Day, till the Bu&s;ine&s;s was over. &mdash; Indeed the <HI>four Mini&s;ters</HI> that were pre&s;ent at the De&s;ire of Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> and <HI>Clap,</HI> when tho&s;e Gentlemen gave their Account of Matters to the Council, did &s;eem &s;ur|priz'd to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> apprehended. And one of them particularly, &s;aid to a Mini&s;ter of the Coun|cil, that <HI>he knew nothing of it, but was &s;urpriz'd and griev'd at it.</HI> And we charitably believe him; for till then they imagin'd the Council was to be ap|prehended;
<PB N="80" REF="003996_0080_100375B38E1AAFF0">for the &s;udden Change of their con|certed Mea&s;ures from the Council to Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> was made while they were pre&s;ent in the Council at the Hearing; and, we make no doubt, but it was a grievous Di&s;appointment to them, that the Mem|bers of the Council were not &s;eiz'd &amp; committed, in&s;tead of Mr. <HI>Breck.</HI> &mdash; That it mayn't be &s;aid this is a bare Conjecture of ours, we will tran&s;cribe a Pa&s;&s;age or two from a Letter, which one of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters afterwards wrote to a Mini&s;ter of the Council, &mdash; <HI>"I thought I had &s;atisfied you when at Springfield, that I was not acce&s;&s;ary to the Mea&s;ures that the civil Magi&s;trate took; for you told me you believ'd me, when I told you I was not. But I hear in Town, and from Bo&s;ton, that I am mi&s;taken if I think I have &s;atis|fied you, that I was no way acce&s;&s;ary,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I am &s;orry that my Veracity is bro't into &s;uch Su&s;picion with you; but yet I venture again to tell you, and that in Writing, that I am not &s;en&s;ible that I was acce&s;&s;ary: For the Ap|plication to the civil Authority, by the grieved Party, was not only without my Advice, but even without my Know|ledge. For Capt.

We would then ask them, Whether they advis'd again&s;t it when they did know it, or manife&s;ted a Di&s;approbation of it? If they had

Tho' &s;uch a Te&s;timonal as this, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, would have been e&s;teem'd a &s;ufficient Satisfaction, yet the Council did not think it was in this. Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> was therefore directed to prepare and give in a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith,</HI> which if it was e&s;teem'd or|thodox, &s;hould be publickly deliver'd at his Ordi|nation, if they proceeded to it. Such a one he gave in, which, when it was read and con&s;ider'd by the Council, was unanimou&s;ly approv'd by them as an orthodox Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; and, at the De|mand of the Moderator in the Name of the Coun|cil, it was publickly deliver'd by him, previous to his Ordination; and is as follows,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>IN AS MUCH as it is de&s;ired of me, by Tho&s;e who I think have a Right to be &s;atisfied, that I &s;hould give an Account, what tho&s;e Principles and Doctrines are, which I believe my &s;elf, and &s;hall endeavour to teach others; I do with all Freedom of Mind, and I hope with Seriou&s;ne&s;s of Spirit, (con&s;idering my &s;elf as before the Heart-&s;earching God) declare to the Church that has cho&s;en me to be their Pa&s;tor, to the Churches convened on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, and to all the World, as follows,</HI></P>
<P>I Believe that <HI>there is a God,</HI> who&s;e eternal Power and God|head are to be clearly &s;een from the Things which he has made: But I believe the Light of Nature is no way &s;uffi|cient to lead us into the true Knowledge of what God is, and what he requires of us, in order to our Glorifying him here, and coming to the Enjoyment of him hereafter.</P>
<P>I therefore acknowledge <HI>the Nece&s;&s;ity of divine Revelation,</HI> and believe this is to be found in the Books of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment,</HI> and in no other: The&s;e I mo&s;t heartily receive as of di|vine Original and Authority, and believe that God has to this Day, in his Providence, kept them <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>uncorrupt.</HI></P>
<P>According to the&s;e I believe that there is <HI>but One God,</HI> who is over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever; yet, that in the <HI>Unity of the Godhead there are three Per&s;ons,</HI> the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, who are the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance, and equal in Power and Glory: And as this is a Doctrine of pure Revelation, &s;o I look upon it to be of the highe&s;t Importance in Religion, and that on which the greate&s;t Truths of the Go&s;pel do depend.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="003996_0089_1003597FB13FA2B0">
I believe that this one God hath, from all Eternity, <HI>decreet</HI> and <HI>fore-ordained</HI> in the Council of his own Will, what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s in Time: yet &s;o as not to take away the Will of his Creatures, or make him&s;elf to be the Author of Sin.</P>
<P>I believe that as the great God <HI>created</HI> all Things at fir&s;t by the Word of his Power, &s;o he does now by his powerful Pro|vidence, <HI>uphold, pre&s;erve,</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> his Creatures, all their Ac|tions and Affairs, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t of them.</P>
<P>I believe that <HI>God made Man at fir&s;t in his own Image,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s; giving him a Law for the Rule of his Obedience; and entring into a Covenant, wherein Life was promi&s;ed to him and all his Po&s;terity, upon Condition of his perfect and per&s;onal obeying the &s;ame; endowing him al&s;o with a Stock of Grace &s;ufficient to enable him thereunto: But that Man being made mutable, did, thro' the Subtilty and Temptation of Satan, wilfully tran&s;gre&s;s the Law of his Creation, and break Covenant with God by eating the forbidden Fruit.</P>
<P>I al&s;o believe that <HI>Adam</HI> being the <HI>Covenant,</HI> as well as <HI>Natural Head</HI> of all Mankind, he by this fir&s;t Sin of his, derived both Guilt and Corruption to all his Po&s;terity: So that every Man as he comes into the World, is both odious to God's Holine&s;s, and obnoxious to his Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But God having from all Eternity, a De&s;ign to glorify the Riches of his Grace, in the Recovery and Salvation of an <HI>elect Number</HI> of the fallen Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> hath made a <HI>new Cove|nant,</HI> wherein the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;tands as their <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Surety.</HI></P>
<P>In order to this I believe, That in the fulne&s;s of Time, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, being the eternal <HI>Son of God, became Man.</HI> I believe the my&s;terious Union of the divine and humane Na|tures in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t: I believe that in order to &s;atis|fy divine Ju&s;tice for the Sins of the Elect, and reconcile them to God, he offer'd up him&s;elf a Sacrifice upon the Cro&s;s. And, as he was deliver'd for their Offences, &s;o I believe he was rai|&s;ed for their Ju&s;tification, and after wards a&s;cended into Heaven, where he is now at the Right Hand of God, making Interce&s;|&s;ion for his People.</P>
<P>I believe that it is the peculiar Work and Office of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> to make the effectual Application of the Benefits of Chri&s;t's Redemption to the Souls of Men; and that he does this by working Faith in them, and thereby uniting them to Chri&s;t in their effectual Calling.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="003996_0090_100375F01EC211B8">
I believe that fallen Man has left all Power to what is &s;pi|ritually Good, and is not able to convert or turn him&s;elf to God; and therefore that <HI>Effectual Calling</HI> is the &s;pecial and al|mighty Work of the Spirit of God, in and upon the Hearts of Sinners, whereby of unwilling they are made willing, in the Day of his Power, to go to Chri&s;t for Life.</P>
<P>I believe that all that are effectually Called, are <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> thro' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t imputed unto them, and received by Faith of God's own Operation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e I believe the Work of <HI>Sanctification</HI> will be carried on, and they will be enabled to per&s;evere in Grace and Holi|ne&s;s to the End of their Lives.</P>
<P>At Death I believe that the Souls of the Righteous are made perfect in Holine&s;s, and do pa&s;s into Glory and Happine&s;s; but the Spirits of the Wicked into Torments and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I believe the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will come a &s;econd Time to Rai&s;e the Dead and Judge the World; then &s;hall the Wicked in their rai&s;ed Bodies, go into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment; but the Righteous into Life Eternal.</P>
<P><HI>THIS is the Sum of that Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which I have lear|ned from the Holy Scriptures, and &s;hall think my &s;elf obliged to teach others in the be&s;t Manner I am able; while at the &s;ame Time I put them that pro&s;e&s;s to believe, in Mind that they be careful to maintain good Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And I hope it will be my Prayer to the Father of Lights, that my Knowledge of the&s;e Things may be enlarg'd, and my Faith of them con|firm'd, and that I may be enabled always to keep the My&s;tery of Faith in a pure Con&s;cience.</HI></P>

If Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> is now really an ortho|dox Man, how can he &s;atisfy any that he is &s;o, but by an Examination, and a &s;olemn Declaration of his Faith? Unle&s;s it will be &s;aid, There &s;hould be a Time of <HI>Probation;</HI> and this there was in his Ca&s;e; for he had been preaching at <HI>Springfield,</HI> after he left <HI>Connecticut,</HI> more than a Year &amp; half, and approv'd him&s;elf orthodox by the Tenor of his Conver&s;ation and Preaching there. If one that had been &s;ettled for &s;ome Years in the Mini&s;try, had been charg'd with &s;uch Errors, and the Charges prov'd, and the Per&s;on, after a le&s;s Time of Probation than Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> had been preaching at <HI>Springfield,</HI> had re|nounc'd the Errors he was charg'd with, and own'd the contrary Truths, and &s;olemnly engag'd to teach them for the Time to come, it would, doubtle&s;s, have been, in the Opinion of prudent &amp; charitable Men, a &s;ufficient Foundation for his being re&s;tor'd to the Exerci&s;e of his Mini&s;try. How much rather then &s;hould this be e&s;teem'd a Satisfaction, in the Ca&s;e of a young Student, (ju&s;t bolted out of Col|lege, at little more than 20 Years of Age,) before it can be &s;uppos'd he had duly inform'd his Under|&s;tanding, and &s;ettled his Principles? Allow all the Objections again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> in their full Strength, without any Abatement on any Account, and &s;ay that he was of &s;uch Principles, two or three Years ago; &s;till he was not wor&s;e than a <HI>Heretic,</HI> make the wor&s;t of him. Now the Rule of the Go&s;pel in &s;uch a Ca&s;e is, Tit. 3.10. <HI>A Man that is a Heretic,
<PB N="93" REF="003996_0093_10037601FAC6EBB8">after the fir&s;t and &s;econd Admonition, reject.</HI> The End of the Admonition is doubtle&s;s to rectific the State of the Man's Mind, and reduce him from his Errors; if this is an&s;wer'd, and the Man makes a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth, that may be accounted &s;incere in a Judgment of Charity, he mu&s;t not be rejected: The Rejection is to be only in Ca&s;e he continues ob&s;tinate and irreclaimable. By what Rule then &s;hould this young Gentleman be rejected from the Mini&s;try, who was free to &s;ay, that whatever Doubts had been in his Mind in Time pa&s;t about &s;ome certain Points in Religion, they had been long &s;ince removed, by Study, Conver&s;ation and Prayer; who actually &s;ubmitted to an Examination about tho&s;e Points; who openly and &s;olemnly, as in the Sight of God, own'd the contrary Truths; and farther declar'd, <HI>That if any &s;till wanted Satis|faction, by Conference, or any other Way, he &s;tood ready to give it to the ut mo&s;t of his Power?</HI> As we know of no Rule by which his Rejection could be ju&s;tified, &s;o we think there are many would have been tran&s;|gre&s;s'd by it.</P>
<P>As to Objections again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> that re&s;pected his <HI>Morals,</HI> be&s;ides what relates to the Books, (which we believe, every one of our Readers will think ought no more to be mention'd) we know of none, but what they call his a&s;per&s;ing &s;ome of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es; by &s;aying, <HI>One of them lied,</HI> and he <HI>would not take another's Word for a Groat.</HI> We have been often told in the Narrative who the&s;e Gentlemen were, namely, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> had declar'd, that when Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> came to vi&s;it him, after he was at <HI>Springfield,</HI> to di&s;cour&s;e with him about the Objections he had &s;ent thither again&s;t him, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in it, <HI>that the Heathen might be &s;av'd without Faith.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> heard the Re|port of this, he in his Ha&s;te did &s;ay, <HI>Mr. Clap lied.</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="003996_0094_1003760B84B97CE8">When his &s;aying &s;o of Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> was mention'd to him in the A&s;&s;ociation as Matter of Offence, he immediately &s;aid. "He was &s;orry he expre&s;s'd him|&s;elf in &s;o ha&s;ty and indecent a Manner, but he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it that in what Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> &s;aid of him he was wrong'd". Indeed it looks very &s;trange that Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> &s;hould &s;o expre&s;s him&s;elf to Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> at this Time, when the whole De&s;ign of his Vi&s;it was to &s;ee if he could &s;atisfie Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> that &s;o he might manife&s;t him&s;elf &s;atisfied to the Gentlemen of <HI>Hamp|&s;hire;</HI> yet he <HI>might</HI> do it: But then the Burthen of Proof lies upon Mr. <HI>Clap;</HI> and as the Conver&s;ation was private, between Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> and Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> alone, Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> is not able to prove it, if Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> did really &s;ay &s;o. In this Ca&s;e, no other Acknowledg|ment can in Ju&s;tice be in&s;i&s;ted on from Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> but only that he did not expre&s;s him&s;elf in a &s;uita|ble Manner; that con&s;idering Mr. <HI>Clap</HI>'s Station and Character, in&s;tead of &s;aying he <HI>lied,</HI> he &s;hould have &s;aid, he was <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> or mi&s;-under&s;tood him &mdash; And, to this Purpo&s;e Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> did not only &s;peak to the A&s;&s;ociation, but write to Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> him|&s;elf. The Words of his Letter are, "<HI>So far as I have been faulty, or have fail'd in &s;hewing that Re&s;pect which was due to you, or of that Meekne&s;s which becomes a Chri&s;tian, I ask Chri&s;tian Forgivene&s;s; and de&s;ire your Prayers,</HI> &amp;c."</P>
<P>As to the Rea&s;on of Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf as he did, re&s;pecting the Rev. Mr. <HI>Kirtland,</HI> we are not particularly acquainted with it; but the Council were much concern'd that both the&s;e Gen|tlemen might have a proper Satisfaction given them, if they had been hurt in their Reputation. And therefore when they were with the Council, after they had &s;aid all they cho&s;e to &s;ay about Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> relating to Principles, the Moderator in the Name of the Council, inquir'd of them, "Whether they
<PB N="95" REF="003996_0095_10035991C0838010">had any Charges to make again&s;t Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> upon the Account of any per&s;onal Injury he had done them? That if they had there might be a rea&s;o|nable Satisfaction given them by Mr. <HI>Breck,</HI> which he at the &s;ame Time declar'd he was ready to give." But both the&s;e Gentlemen declin'd making any Charge upon him, or manife&s;ting them&s;elves offen|ded with him upon any &s;uch Account. And this is the Ground of what the Council &s;ay in their Re&s;ult, That they <HI>are not &s;en&s;ible of any Thing re&s;pecting his Morals, to di&s;qualifie him for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; ina&s;|much as tho&s;e Per&s;ons who have tho't them&s;elves a&s;pers'd by him, bad an Opportunity to bring in their Complaints, but did not do it; and to one of them particularly he had given what might be look'd upon to be chri&s;tian Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>And now that we may draw to a CONCLUSION.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, in our Turn, <HI>de&s;ire all that will allow them|&s;elves to make U&s;e of their Rea&s;on, and to think coolly on the Matter, to judge to whom it is that all the va&s;t Confu|&s;ion is owing, that has hapned with Relation to this Ca&s;e.</HI> We know indeed all Men are apt to be partial to them&s;elves in judging of their own Actions, yet we can't help thinking our Proceedings in this Affair are to be ju&s;tified upon the Principles of <HI>Liberty</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI> For we invaded no Men's Right. The Church at <HI>Springfield,</HI> which call'd us to act in their Affairs, was a free Church; and had never put them&s;elves under the Juri&s;diction of tho&s;e Gen|tlemen that oppos'd us. They were inquir'd of, "Whether they had by any Vote, oblig'd them|&s;elves to referr their Concerns only to the Mini&s;ters and Churches of that A&s;&s;ociation?" And they declar'd, No! It was al&s;o further declar'd, That tho' &s;uch a Vote had once been projected in the A&s;&s;ociation and offer'd to the Churches, and &s;ome of the Churches had been bro't into it, yet that this Church of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and &s;ome others in the Coun|ty,
<PB N="96" REF="003996_0096_10037613976A1460">had refus'd it.&mdash; We think al&s;o our Proceed|ing to the Settlement of Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> in this Church, is to be ju&s;tified upon the Principle of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> as well as <HI>Tenderne&s;s,</HI> to one who had been devoted to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and &s;pent a con&s;ide|rable Part of his Patrimony in his Education for it; who had now given &s;uch Satisfaction of his Sound|ne&s;s in the Faith, and of who&s;e Abilities for the Work of the Mini&s;try, and Sutablene&s;s to be their Pa&s;tor, the Church that call'd him were generally &s;o well &s;atisfied.&mdash;And that we have not e&s;pous'd the Cau&s;e of Liberty, or that of a particular Per&s;on or Society, to the Damage of the Cau&s;e of <HI>Truth,</HI> which &s;hould be mo&s;t dear to us, we think appears from the Care we took to have the great Doctrines of the Go&s;pel both &s;ecur'd &amp; honour'd: We may &s;ay, Such Care as was never before taken at any Ordina|tion in the Country. And tho' the&s;e Gentlemen are pleas'd to repre&s;ent us as <HI>Favourers of heterodox Prin|ciples,</HI> and having <HI>opened a Door for the letting in of Error upon the Churches,</HI> if Churches that are here|after call'd to Ordinations, whether they are at a Di&s;tance, or near at Hand, will take as much Care, and receive the like Satisfaction and Engagements from tho&s;e whom they introduce into the Mini&s;try, we believe there will be le&s;s Danger of the letting in of Error, than there has been for &s;ome Time pa&s;t. For our Parts, we can't, after all, but hope our Con|duct in this Affair will be a real Service to the Cau&s;e of Truth, as well as Liberty, in our Churches.&mdash; And we can't but wi&s;h our Brethren of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> would, at this Time, put on a little more of that <HI>Charity, which rejoices in the Truth,</HI> and in Per&s;ons be|ing bro't to own and acknowledge it. Or if they &s;till allow them&s;elves to &s;u&s;pect Mr. <HI>Breck</HI>'s Sinceri|ty, let them &s;tay till he does &s;omething again&s;t the Truth, before they go to give him and his Church any more Trouble. Since there has been &s;uch Con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="97" REF="003996_0097_10037619095943C8">already, let them but do their Endeavour there &s;hould be no more, &amp; Things would, probably, very &s;oon return to a State of Peace If it be the Cau&s;e of Truth and not their own apprehended A&s;&s;ociation Rights they have at Heart, (as they pretend) &s;ince Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> has been &s;olemnly ordained to the Mini&s;try upon tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ed Principles which they account orthodox, why will they not own him as an ortho|dox Mini&s;ter, till he di&s;covers him&s;elf to be other|wi&s;e, and admit him to join with them in promo|ting the common Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and &s;o prevent, or heal, the Breach in their A&s;|&s;ociation, which they &s;eem &s;o much concerned a|bout? This, we know, is what has been earne&s;tly recommended to them by &s;ome whom they profe&s;s a great Honour for, and is what would rejoice their be&s;t Friends that are at a Di&s;tance from them. But if they continue to &s;hew no Regard to Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> as a Mini&s;ter, and will not &s;o much as pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Mini&s;try, upon &s;pecial Occa&s;ions that lead to it; and if they countenance the Mea|&s;ures that are now taking, to get the Pari&s;h pre|&s;ented to the civil Court, for not being &s;upplied with an orthodox Mini&s;ter as the Law requires, we fear tho&s;e who have been ready to think there was nothing but the Wi&s;dom and Meekne&s;s of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in them, will be ready to &s;ay, <HI>Ye know not what Man|ner of Spirits ye are of:</HI> And tho' they may call it <HI>Con|&s;cience,</HI> others will be apt to put another Name upon it.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen conclude their Defence, with a &s;olemn Appeal to Heaven, in the following Words; <HI>Whoever condemns us, we re&s;t in the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, appealing to our Lord and Ma&s;ter, who has &s;ent us into his Vineyard and who is the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, that is omni&s;cient, &amp; never blinded with Prejudice, that he would judge us with re&s;pect to our Uprightne&s;s in this Affair.</HI>&mdash;Some &s;erious, con&s;iderate
<PB N="98" REF="003996_0098_10036C7307A40E00">Chri&s;tians, have been a little &s;urpriz'd at &s;o &s;trong an Appeal in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. For our Part, We are &s;en&s;ible that Controver&s;y always rai&s;es a Du&s;t, that tends to blind even wi&s;e &amp; good Men; and when &s;uch are fallen into a Contention, each Party are too apt to act from other Principles be&s;ides tho&s;e of Religion and Con&s;cience, and yet not always be &s;en&s;ible wherein, or how far, they have done &s;o. They are but little acquainted with the Infirmities and Corruptions of Men in their pre&s;ent be&s;t State, that will not allow <HI>it is humane &s;o to err.</HI> We would remember the Words of the great Apo&s;tle, <HI>I know nothing by my &s;elf, yet am I not hereby ju&s;tified:</HI> and therefore in&s;tead of &s;uch a confident Appeal, we would take the Liberty to clo&s;e this Vindication, as the Sermon at the Ordination concluded, with a humble Prayer, <Q>That wherein any of us, on either Part, have failed or done amils, God would &s;hew it to us, humble us for it, and <HI>&s;pare us according to his great Mercy!</HI> And that wherein we have acted &s;incerely, from right Principles, &amp; for right Ends, we may find Acceptance, for the &s;ake of the per|fect Obedience of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who <HI>al|wayes did the Things that pleas'd the Father!</HI> &mdash;That the God of Love, would unite his Mini&s;ters and Churches, in Love to Chri&s;t and one another, till we &s;hall all come to that ble&s;&s;ed World, where no Offence &s;hall ari&s;e, where there &s;hall be no Jar, no Contention, but perfect Love and Peace and Charity, &s;hall reign for ever and ever! Where that Prayer of our Saviour for his Church and People, will have its full and everla&s;ting Accom|pli&s;hment, THAT THEY ALL MAY BE ONE, AS THOU FATHER ART IN ME, AND I IN THEE; THAT THEY ALL MAY BE ONE IN US! <HI>AMEN.</HI></Q></P>
