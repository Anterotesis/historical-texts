<P>_THE Occa&s;ion of the following Di&s;cour&s;es, of which the fir&s;t is but a Preparative to the &s;e|cond, was the Removal of a certain Per&s;on by Death, &s;ome &s;mall Space of Time after the La&s;t &s;acra|mental Solemnity, which has been the Sub|ject Matter of much Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Oc|ca&s;ion of many Reflections.</P>
<P>I thought it was my Duty to improve that &s;olemn Providence publickly, for the Edification and Vindication of &s;uch as are truly pious, and for the Conviction of the Impenitent: This therefore I have at|tempted in the Sermons following, which by the Advice of Friends are now &s;ubmitted to
<PB N="4" REF="040085_0003_101627E65EF66FF8">the Readers Judgment, with this Reque&s;t, that he would not condemn them, either in the Whole or in Part, before he weighs im|partially what is offered in them, by the Sanctuary Scales.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing the awful Providence of God, re&s;pecting the afore&s;aid Per&s;on, gave Birth to the &s;ub&s;equent Di&s;cour&s;es, I judg|ed it not improper to preface them, with &s;ome brief Account of his Character, as al&s;o of the Manner of his being taken, and of his Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>By the be&s;t Information I can get of his Neighbours, he had a very regular and Chri&s;tian like Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And when examined here, the <HI>Saturday</HI> before the Sacrament, he gave a very mo|de&s;t and &s;atisfactory Relation of his gracious Experiences.</P>
<P>The Time and Manner of his being taken was as follows: Upon the Sabbath Even|ing, at the Hou&s;e of a certain Per&s;on near this Place, after the reading of a Chapter of &s;acred Scripture, he was &s;truck with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Holine&s;s of GOD, as overwhelmed his Spirits, &s;o that he fainted
<PB N="5" REF="040085_0004_101627E9F9C7C750">and fell to the Earth; after which the De|vil be&s;et him with violent Temptations, tell|ing him, <HI>That he was a Hypocrite, and as bad as</HI> Spira; the Shock of which his feeble Faith not being able to endure, he was imediately bereaved of the Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on, and then knew not what he &s;poke or acted. This was the Account he gave him&s;elf the <HI>Monday</HI> following, in the Afternoon, when he enjoyed (&s;o far as I and others were capable of judging) the full Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It has been &s;toried about (as I am infor|med) that it was the Preaching of one or more Mini&s;ters, which was the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;order; But there is not the lea&s;t Shadow of Rea&s;on for this A&s;per&s;ion, his own Relations have acknowledged, <HI>That during the whole of his Illne&s;s, he re|flected upon none, as being the Cau&s;es of it.</HI> Surely if there had been any Thing in this, he would have made &s;ome Mention of it that Afternoon afore&s;aid, when the Oc|ca&s;ions of his Di&s;tre&s;s were enquired into; but not one Word Was &s;o much as hinted this Way.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="040085_0005_101627EE13E6E8E0">
The Manner of his Death (as I am in|formed by a Per&s;on of Credit that was then pre&s;ent) Was hopeful; he &s;eemed to enjoy, for &s;ome Space before his Di&s;&s;olution, the Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on, during which he penitently a&s;ked Forgivene&s;s of his Father, re&s;pecting the Faults he had committed a|gain&s;t him, and &s;o expired.</P>
<P>His Relations concur in a&s;&s;erting, that he eat but very little for &s;ome Days before he was taken (&s;o as is before hinted) viz. nothing but a &s;mall Cru&s;t of Bread and Water, Which with his Riding about Thir|ty Miles, for &s;ome Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively (his Place of Abode being about Fifteen Miles from the Meeting) it is probable Weakened his Con&s;titution con&s;iderably, and &s;o prepar|ed Fuel for the Temptations of the Enemy to fa&s;ten with more Power upon him; this he him&s;elf complained of on the afore&s;aid <HI>Munday,</HI> and therewith u&s;ed the P&s;almi&s;t's Petition, <HI>P&s;. li. 8.</HI></P>
<P>Candid Reader, give me Leave to add one Word more, and I &s;hall conclude; I pray God that thou and I may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="7" REF="040085_0006_101627EF9EF78168">him to learn &s;uitable In&s;tructions from, and take &s;ea&s;onable Warning, by &s;uch awful Examples, le&s;t We our &s;elves be made &s;uch.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS Good both Moral and Phy&s;ical is the proper Object of the Will or rational Apetite, &s;o Truth is the proper Object and Food of the Mind. But it is mournful to behold the awful Infatuation and Di&s;order, which have now &s;eized all the noble Powers of rational, once
<PB N="9" REF="040085_0008_101627F4C43777C0">innocent, but now degenerate Creatures! A|las, how imperiou&s;ly do their Wills tyran|nize over their en&s;laved Minds! How eager|ly do they court real Evil under the Gui&s;e of Good, and greedily embrace temporary and peri&s;hing for durable and eternal Gain! And thus like the Dog in the Fable, while they gra&s;p at fleeting Shadows, they lo&s;e the enduring Sub&s;tance! But the fatal Original of this Folly and Di&s;order, is owing to the Defects, Darkne&s;s and Infatuation of the <HI>Mind;</HI> which not only through the corrupt Bya&s;s of the <HI>Will,</HI> but al&s;o becau&s;e of its own native Weakne&s;s and Ignorance, is ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed upon by the &s;ophi&s;tical Arts of Satan and his Emi&s;aries, to a&s;&s;ent to Error and Fal&s;|hood, under the Pretext of Truth. Dreadful In&s;tances of this we have in our Text and Context, in which is contained a De&s;cription of the <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of <HI>Anti-Chri&s;t,</HI> and his deceived <HI>Followers;</HI> as al&s;o of their de&s;erved Ruin and final Overthrow. Some of which I &s;hall mention. And</P>
<P N="1">1. He is called <HI>v.</HI> 3. <HI>That Man of Sin;</HI> which &s;eems to &s;ignify, that he is not only notoriou&s;ly wicked him&s;elf, but commands and commends Impiety in others. And do not the <HI>Popes of Rome</HI> command the Wor|&s;hip of Saints and Angels? Have they not contrived, enjoyned and prai&s;ed the barba|rous
<PB N="10" REF="040085_0009_101627F6ED7FCFD8">Murder of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of all Orders? And do they not connive at the mo&s;t execrable Uncleanne&s;s to advance their worldly In|tere&s;t?</P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Character</HI> is this, <HI>That he op|po&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God or that is wor&s;hiped. v.</HI> 4. Have not <HI>Popes</HI> had the Impudence not only to in|&s;ult, with the greate&s;t Degrees of Di&s;dain <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Emperors,</HI> who are called Gods, becau&s;e they are his Vicegerents, in Re&s;pect of civil Power and Authority, and thereby are dark Shadows and faint Repre&s;entatives of his Glorious Sovereignty, but even to con|front the Authority of God him&s;elf, coun|termanding and ca&s;hiering his po&s;itive Laws and In&s;titutions, and even tearing one of the Commandments out of the Decalogue?</P>
<P N="3">3. The third <HI>Character</HI> is, <HI>That he as God &s;itteth in the Temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God. v.</HI> 4. As God is wor&s;hiped in the A&s;&s;emblies of his People, is not the <HI>Pope</HI> &s;o wor&s;hiped in the <HI>Papi&s;t's</HI> Churches? Do they not &s;tile him <HI>our Lord God the Pope,</HI> in their bla&s;phemous <HI>Mi&s;&s;als?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth <HI>Character</HI> is, <HI>That he is con|cerned in a My&s;tery of Iniquity. v.</HI> 7. <HI>i. e.</HI> Wickedne&s;s cloaked with a fair Pretext of Piety. And will not the <HI>Pope</HI> and his bloody blind Votaries pretend a great Deal of Zeal &amp;
<PB N="11" REF="040085_0010_101627F879114890">and Devotion, when they are going to cut your Throats, or pick your Pockets.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth <HI>Character</HI> is, <HI>That his coming is after the Working of Satan, with all Power and Signs and lying Wonders, and with all Deceiveablene&s;s of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in them that peri&s;h. v.</HI> 10. It is too notorious to be de|nyed, that <HI>Popes</HI> and their Adherents have almo&s;t in every Age, &s;ince their Antichri&s;tian Kingdom has been erected, pretended a Pow|er to work Wonders and Miracles; but their Wonders are lying Ones, mo&s;tly wretched Untruths, or jugling Tricks, and fraudulent Impo&s;itions upon the poor ignorant and de|luded People; or if there was any Reality in any of them, it was through the Working of <HI>Satan. Others may call them pious Frauds</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Henry) but the Apo&s;tle called them Un|righteous and Wicked Frauds; and indeed all Fraud which is contrary to Truth, is an impi|ous Thing;</HI> as the &s;ame Author ob&s;erves.</P>
<P>After the Apo&s;tle had &s;poken thus much, concerning the <HI>Characters of Antichri&s;t,</HI> he comes to de&s;cribe the <HI>Properties</HI> of his <HI>Sub|jects;</HI> one of which is mentioned in the Words I am now to in&s;i&s;t upon, and it is this, <HI>That they receive not the Love of the Truth that they might be &s;aved.</HI> This, in order to vindicate God's Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, in his penal Proce&s;s again&s;t them, is repre&s;ented to
<PB N="12" REF="040085_0011_101627FB6AA8BB08">be the meritorious Cau&s;e of the dreadful Judgments threatned in the following Ver&s;es, as the cau&s;al Particle <HI>[becau&s;e]</HI> &s;ufficiently intim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes, which is twice repeated in this and the following Ver&s;es, [<HI>becau&s;e</HI> and <HI>for this Cau&s;e</HI>] perhaps for a twofold Rea&s;on. (1.) To &s;hew how heinous this Sin of not <HI>receiv|ing the Love of the Truth</HI> is in it &s;elf, and how offen&s;ive to God, as well as de&s;tructive to us. And (2.) to &s;ignify the Stupidity of Sinners who need &s;uch repeated Warnings, in order to fix nece&s;&s;ary Impre&s;&s;ions of their Guilt and Danger becau&s;e of Sin upon them.</P>
<P>Two Words only of the Text under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, <HI>viz. Truth</HI> and <HI>&s;aved,</HI> need Explication, in order to form a doctri|nal Propo&s;ition from them; and (1). let me enquire what may be intended by the Word <HI>Truth</HI> in our Text. To this End con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. More generally, that <HI>Truth</HI> is threefold, <HI>metaphi&s;ical, logical, ethical.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Metaphi&s;ical Truth</HI> is, when the Form or Appearance of a Thing an&s;wers what it repre&s;ents.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Logical Truth</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in our Apprehen|&s;ion of a Thing according to its Nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ethical Truth</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Conformity</HI> of our outward <HI>Expe&s;&s;ions</HI> to our inward <HI>Sen|timents,</HI> or in the Harmony and Agreement of the Speeches of our Lips with the Dictates
<PB N="13" REF="040085_0012_101627FE39655FE8">of our Minds; the fir&s;t is oppo&s;ed to <HI>Paint,</HI> the &s;econd to <HI>Error,</HI> and the third to <HI>Lying,</HI> which as &s;ome ob&s;erve con&s;i&s;ts (at lea&s;t in part) in cro&s;&s;ing the Dictates of the Mind. But when our Speech is concerned in Pro|mi&s;es, then the Truth con&s;i&s;ts not only in expre&s;&s;ing what is agreeable to our Intenti|ons, but in a &s;ea&s;onable and punctual accom|pli&s;hment of what we expre&s;s, in the Time and Manner &s;pecified, unle&s;s &s;ome unavoid|able Hindrance prevent. It is the &s;econd of the&s;e Kinds of <HI>Truth</HI> mentioned, that comes neare&s;t to the De&s;ign of our Text. But</P>
<P N="2">II. More particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Word <HI>Truth</HI> in Scripture is &s;ome|times under&s;tood the <HI>Grace of Truth, viz. Sincerity,</HI> a precious Grace of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Eph.</HI> VI. 14. And</P>
<P N="2">2. Sometimes the <HI>Doctrine of Truth</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel of Grace,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> I. 12. 2 <HI>Joh. v.</HI> 1. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> II. 4. This is called <HI>Truth</HI> by Way of Eminence in three Re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> in Re|gard of its <HI>Author, Nature</HI> and <HI>Effects.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Its <HI>Author</HI> is the God of Truth, an un|changeable &s;imple Being, punctual in the Performances of his Promi&s;es and Threats, <HI>Deut.</HI> XXXII. 4. <HI>He is the Rock, his Work is perfect, for all his Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="040085_0013_10162801011D37A0">
2. The Go&s;pel is called <HI>Truth,</HI> becau&s;e of the Simplicity and Candour of its Doctrines, which give a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of Things, according to their different Natures and final I&s;&s;ues. Sin is there repre&s;ented in its native Horrors, and Holine&s;s in its proper Charms and alluring Attractives, and the Fruits of both &s;et in a true Light. Its Hi&s;tories are an hone&s;t and true Relation of Matters of Fact, as the Simplicity of the Style, and con&s;pir|ing Harmony of its different Narratives wit|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Precepts</HI> are a ju&s;t and true Repre|&s;entation of the Claims of Right, which God and our Neighbour have to our Obedi|ence and Service: A tran&s;cript of the <HI>Na|ture,</HI> and agreeable to the moral Perfections, of that Glorious Being to whom they owe their Original.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> are not like the fabulous <HI>Eli|&s;iums</HI> of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Poets, (tho' natural Men treat them as if they were no better) but True and Faithful. Deut. VII. 9.10. <HI>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Govenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments to a Thou&s;and Generations; and repayeth them that hate him to their Face to de&s;troy them, he will not be &s;lack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his Face.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="040085_0014_101628028B5181B8">
Its <HI>Threats</HI> are no Romances or Bugbears, but &s;uch de&s;erved Penaltys, &s;uited to the Na|ture and Aggravations of Crimes, (whatever &s;ecure Sinners dream to the contrary) as that God who is Ju&s;tice and Truth it &s;elf will &s;urely inflict, <HI>the Heavens and Earth may pa&s;s away, but not one Word that ever God has &s;poken, &s;hall pa&s;s away without its ju&s;t Accom|pli&s;hment,</HI> one <HI>Jot</HI> or <HI>Tittle</HI> of his Truths &s;hall never fail, <HI>Mat.</HI> V. 18.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Terms</HI> are no flattering Impo&s;itions up|on his Di&s;ciples credulity, like the Turki&s;h Tales, but a genuine and true Relation of the wor&s;t they mu&s;t &s;uffer for his Sake.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Arabian</HI> Impo&s;tor <HI>Mahomet,</HI> fir&s;t divulged his religious Hypothe&s;is at <HI>Mecha,</HI> he &s;uited his Principles to corrupt nature's Dictates, and &s;ini&s;ter Inclinations, and made the&s;e Things the great incentive to a Com|pliance with them; which were mo&s;t &s;oo|thing to human Pa&s;&s;ions, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;er|vient to Temporal Intere&s;ts: He promi&s;ed a carnal Paradi&s;e after Death and Honours Profits, and Preferments in Life, as the grand Motives to engage the rude Populace to ad|here to his erroneous Opinions, he indulged the carnal and cruel Appetites, with the unrea&s;onable liberty of abhorred Polygamy, and the mo&s;t Savage Barbarity: By which art full Device, attended with the Terror of
<PB N="16" REF="040085_0015_101628062D8B83F0">the civil Sword; he allur'd &s;ome and &s;car'd others into his Sentiments. The great Gran|dees with their pompous Retinues, quickly li&s;ten'd to the Sen&s;e plea&s;ing Sounds, and danc'd after the inchanting Pipe of that fatal <HI>Orpheus:</HI> And no wonder, for Nature needs not many Per&s;wa&s;ives to enduce a Compliance with what it has the &s;tronge&s;t innate Pronene&s;s to, and Tendency after. But our Glorious <HI>JESUS</HI> not intending a Kingdom in this World took not &s;uch Mea|&s;ures to erect it, as were hatched in the Womb of carnal Wi&s;dom. Nay, on the contrary the Terms our Lord propo&s;ed were &s;o oppo|&s;ite to the corrupt Inclinations of Nature, &s;o cro&s;s to Men's Honour and Intere&s;ts, that they &s;eem'd to have a Natural and &s;trong Tendency to drive the whole World away from him, in&s;tead of gaining any to him, our Lord propos'd no temporal Paradi&s;e to his Di&s;ciples here, nor a carnal One here|after; but on the contrary informed them that they mu&s;t expect a continu'd Scene of Affliction and Sorrow in this World. <HI>Joh.</HI> XVI 33. <HI>Acts</HI> XIV. 22. <HI>Joh.</HI> XVI. 20, As al&s;o, that they mu&s;t deny their Lu&s;ts, Wills, Honours and temporary Intere&s;ts, and that on the Account of a Spiritual and (at pre&s;ent) invi&s;ible Glory and Happine&s;s, to be enjoy'd in the next State. <HI>Luke.</HI> IX. 23.
<PB N="17" REF="040085_0016_10162808C5902220">This duly con&s;idered, together with the &s;peedy and va&s;t Progre&s;s, the Go&s;pel made in the early Ages of Chri&s;tianity among the polite&s;t Nations, and that without the Helps of civil Power, or human Literature, yea, again&s;t the utmo&s;t Force, of both, &s;hews with meridi|an Brightne&s;s the divine Birth of that Go&s;pel we pro&s;e&s;s, who&s;e holy Laws and equal Terms are &s;o contrary to the corrupt Lu&s;ts and natural Inclinations of Mankind, that unle&s;s they had been accompanied with Di|vine Energy, none would (in the Face of &s;uch Danger as the primitive Chri&s;tians were expo&s;ed to) have complied with them, and &s;o the Chri&s;tian Name would have been long ago extinct, and therefore none now in being to profe&s;s the Lord <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> What! to give up and entirely abandon all the&s;e Lu&s;ts and Intere&s;ts, which we naturally love above our Lives, yea, our Souls, and expo&s;e our &s;elves to a Series of Shame, Pain and Suffering, and all for the Promi&s;es of a future and un&s;een World!

<P>Another Argument confirming the rea|lity of a divine Providence, may be drawn from the Order and Harmony, which is con|tinually pre&s;erved, both in the natural and moral Creation.</P>
<P>It's &s;urprizing to behold, how all the nu|merous Creatures in the &s;pacious Univer&s;e, are exactly fitted in their Form and Texture, to an&s;wer the various U&s;es for which they are de&s;ign'd!

He that duly

For that the tran&s;|ver&s;e or cro&s;s Motions of unthinking Crea|tures, &s;hould conduce to attain one uniform end and that worthy of the wi&s;e&s;t Agent; mu&s;t needs be a&s;cribed to an infinite Mind, who &s;its at the Helm of Government, fixes the Springs, and guides the Wheels of Motion.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider Mankind, either in their private, civil, or religious Capacities; the reality and Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uperintending Providence, will appear con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>For, are they not protected by an invi&s;i|ble Power, amid&s;t the various Deaths, and Dangers which environ and pur&s;ue human Life, in all it's winding Labrinths, (as the Shadow the Body) and that &s;ometimes by a &s;urprizing Train of unexpected Occurrences?</P>
<P>What el&s;e can re&s;train the Wrath of &s;avage &s;elfi&s;h Men, from boyling over its ju&s;t Boun|daries, to the utter De&s;truction of human Society?

And what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for many Duties of Religion, if we believe not, that God has the &s;upream di&s;po&s;al of all Events. How can we rationally tru&s;t in him in the mid&s;t of Danger for Protection, Pray to him in want for &s;upply, or Prai&s;e him for Mercies already vouch&s;afed? &mdash; But not to in&s;i&s;t,</P>
<P>As Man in his <HI>Creation,</HI> was the <HI>Crown</HI> of all the vi&s;ible Works of God.

<P>More <HI>generally</HI> the De&s;ign of &s;uch dark Pro|vidences is to vindicate the divine Soveraig|nity over all, to magnify the Riches of his pure Grace upon &s;ome, and his &s;trict Ju&s;tice towards others, according to his invariable and eternal Purpo&s;es; of which Providence is but the Executor. 1. <HI>Pet.

<P>More <HI>particularly</HI> as to good People the Intentions of the afore&s;aid Providences, &s;eem to be the&s;e following, namly</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>excite</HI> their <HI>fear,</HI> becau&s;e of God's Holine&s;s and their own meanne&s;s, that they may <HI>enter into the Rock, and hide them in the Du&s;t, for &s;ear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Maje&s;ty.</HI> It is in this Re&s;pect the P&s;almi&s;t crys out, <HI>P&s;.

It was doubtle&s;s to vindicate the divine Wor|&s;hip from a &s;ordid Contempt, and prophane irreverence, that the thou&s;ands of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were
<PB N="139" REF="040085_0134_101629320C4B9928">&s;truck with a &s;olemn dread, by the Death of <HI>Uzzah.</HI> And no doubt this was the Cau&s;e why &s;o many of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Church were &s;ei|zed with &s;ickne&s;s and &s;wallow'd up of Death, immediately after the Sacramental Solem|nity.</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>excite</HI> their <HI>Faith,</HI> dark Providen|ces give room for the Exerci&s;e of that noble Grace, which it is our Honour, our Duty, and our Intere&s;t to live by. <HI>Heb. X.</HI> 38. This inclines a gracious Per&s;on with <HI>Abraham</HI> not to &s;tagger at the promi&s;e, but to <HI>Hope again&s;t Hope,</HI> (i. e. again&s;t human probability or the pre&s;ent A&s;pect or Cour&s;e of Things) upon that &s;table and faithful Foundation the Word of God. <HI>Rom. IV.</HI> 18, 20. <HI>Heb. X.</HI> 23.</P>
<P>Al&s;o with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the mid&s;t of danger, when no Way opens for e&s;cape, to wait patiently for the Salvation of God. <HI>Ex. XIV.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>And with <HI>Habakkuk,</HI> in the mid&s;t of want and Penury when all the Ci&s;terns of earthly Succour fail, to rejoyce in the God of his Sal|vation. <HI>Mal. III.</HI> 17, 18. The Exerci&s;e of this noble Grace of Faith was no doubt the great de&s;ign of that trying Providence to|wards <HI>Abraham,</HI> re&s;pecting his &s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould &s;lay him who was the Son of the Promi&s;e, his only Son, the Son of his eager De&s;ires and blooming Hopes, the Staff of his
<PB N="140" REF="040085_0135_10162935FA50C988">aged Years, and thereby at once break the Laws of Nature and of God, expo&s;e Religi|on to the Reproach of Heathens, and him|&s;elf to the continual revilings and abhorrence of the Wife of his Bo&s;om. And yet not|with&s;tanding the&s;e &s;urprizing Difficulties, he di&s;puted not the divine Precept, que&s;tio|ned not the divine Promi&s;e, but obey's! See dear Brethren how con&s;picuou&s;ly divine Wi&s;dom &s;hines in bringing to pa&s;s this dark and trying Providence, the i&s;&s;ue of which tends &s;o much to illu&s;trate the Honours of the divine Goodne&s;s and faithfullne&s;s, and to render perpetually apparent the a&s;toni&s;h|ing Strength, and tran&s;cendent Beauty of his Servants Faith, and Obedience; which &s;o well de&s;erves our highe&s;t Admiration, and &s;o ju&s;tly demands our laborious Imitation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another De&s;ign of tho&s;e dark Di&s;pen|&s;ations, is to try the Love of Gods People, the Lord Je&s;us &s;peaks to his People, by them, as he did to <HI>Peter, Joh. XXI.</HI> 15. <HI>Simon Son of Jonas, love&s;t thou me more then the&s;e,</HI> (i. e.) do you Love me more then all your Friends and dear Relations? More then all your worldly Occupations and delectable Enjoyments? More then your Honour, your Ea&s;e your Life? Without which you can have no real Intere&s;t in my Per&s;on, or Be|nefit by my &s;uffering; (that is &s;pecial and
<PB N="241" REF="040085_0136_1016293834E38918">durable) then bear my Cro&s;s, endure Re|proach, and Shame for my &s;ake. You profe&s;s Love by your Lips, &s;hew it by your Practi&s;e; Love not in word and in Tongue, (i. e. only) but in deed and in truth, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> III. 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another end of tho&s;e &s;tumbling Provi|dences, is to <HI>excite de&s;ire</HI> in God's People after Heaven, if they enjoyed a continued Scene of Honour, Ea&s;e and Pro&s;perity in this World, it is probable they would be too thoughtle&s;s of the next; too little affec|ted with the Glories of it, either in longing af|ter them, or in a delight&s;ome expectation of en|joying them But when tho&s;e Lillies find them|&s;elves perpetually environ'd with piercing Thorns, attended with a Train of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Di&s;a&s;ters, that oftentimes like <HI>Noa's</HI> Dove upon the watry World, they cannot find a re&s;ting Place; for <HI>without are fightings, and within are fears.</HI> 2. <HI>Cor. VII.</HI> 5. This makes the Thoughts of a re&s;t above &s;weet to their oppre&s;&s;ed Hearts, as the Expectation of <HI>Ca|naan</HI> was to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> wearied in the De|&s;arts Labrinths; or as the Hopes of a calm Harbour is plea&s;ant to the perplexed Mariner, where he may find a &s;afe Sanctuary from the blu&s;tring Winds, a &s;ecure retreat from the enraged Deeps.</P>
<P>This makes them groan within them&s;elves <HI>waiting for the Redemption of their Bodies</HI> Rom. <HI>VIII.</HI> 23.</P>

5.

<P N="1"><PB N="170" REF="040085_0165_1016297FC93E7098">
1. The Nature of the damned's Torments, appears in two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Their privative and po&s;&s;itive Mi&s;eries, or in the evils of lo&s;s and Sen&s;e they are expo&s;ed to, thus the Pu|ni&s;hments of the damned are generally, and I think ju&s;tly de&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>privative mi&s;eries</HI> of the <HI>Damned</HI> are principaly the&s;e following, namely they &s;hall be perfectly and eternally &s;eperated from all Union to, Communion with, and Enjoy|ment of the ble&s;&s;ed God; who is mo&s;t cer|tainly the fir&s;t Truth and Supreme Good, the great &s;ource and Spring of Happine&s;s; <HI>who&s;e Favour is better then Life,</HI> and who&s;e Frowns are wor&s;e then Death. And by con|&s;equence bereaved of tho&s;e holy Qualities, and delightful Enjoyments which are the proper and natural I&s;&s;ues of his gracious Pre|&s;ence; as well as perpetually Bani&s;hed from the Seat of his glorious Re&s;idence, where tho&s;e are exerted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Perfec|tion of Beauty and Delight; and finaly &s;e|perated from that Bli&s;sful Fellow&s;hip and &s;ocial Wor&s;hip, with Saints and Angels, which are equally the Ornament and Entertainment of the Courts above.</P>
<P>In this Li&s;e the wicked for the mo&s;t Part, are not &s;en&s;ible how va&s;t the Lo&s;s of a God is; their Minds are &s;o mi&s;erably darkned by Sin, that they have no &s;uitable Appre|hen&s;ions

<P>Again they are &s;trangely diverted, from contemplating upon the divine Perfections, by the Amu&s;ements of worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;en&s;itive Plea&s;ure; to which they have a &s;trong Bya&s;s, and Inclination of will and af|fections. <HI>Rom.</HI> VIII. 5. <HI>For they that are af|ter the Fle&s;h, do mind the Things of the Fle&s;h:</HI> Natural Men are &s;o fle&s;hly, &s;o far de|generated into Bea&s;ts; that they pur&s;ue prin|cipally as their chief good (notwith&s;tanding their fal&s;e Preten&s;es to the contrary) tho&s;e Gratifications that are common to them; thay have &s;o far extingui&s;hed the &s;mall Re|mains of the divine Image, and forgot the Dignity of the human Nature, that they eager|ly pur&s;ue the &s;ame De&s;ign of Life with Brutes, and the chief Difference between them (in this re&s;pect) is that they are more artful and mi&s;chievous then they, in the pro&s;ecution of it. They greedily endeavour to glut their fle&s;hly Souls with carnal De|lights, and when di&s;appointed in one Object they run to another with impatient ha&s;te, and thus they &s;pend their wretched Lives in fruitle&s;s Labours and Di&s;appoint|ments; <HI>Rom.</HI> VI. 27. And by this hurrie are kept from the nece&s;&s;ary Knowledge of;
<PB N="172" REF="040085_0167_101629841EA4E8E0">and &s;uitable Meditation upon the &s;upreme Being.</P>
<P>But the Damned will have a confounding Sen&s;e of the Lo&s;s of a God in Eternity, when their Minds being freed from their pre&s;ent Diver&s;ions, Amu&s;ements, and mi&s;|takes, &s;hall be experimentally and judicially enlarged, to Frame a ju&s;ter E&s;timate of the divine Goodne&s;s, and Excellency both E&s;&s;en|tial and communicative; and con&s;equently inclined to dwell for ever upon the mourn|ful Thoughts of their being &s;eperated eter|naly from them. The ble&s;&s;ed God being the fountain of all de&s;irable Good both Moral and Phi&s;ical, the Soul that is &s;eperated from him can have no more &s;olid Delight and Sa|tisfaction, &s;uited to its noble Nature and wor|thy of its exalted De&s;ires; then the Body of animal Life when &s;eperated from the Soul.</P>
<P>And are not natural Men in general as &s;tupidly and in&s;en&s;ible of the other Bereave|ments before hinted? They have no <HI>Pi&s;ga's</HI> pro&s;pect (by faith) of the cele&s;tial Canaan nor any ta&s;te or reli&s;h (being carnal) of tho&s;e pious plea&s;ures which are the natural Re&s;ult of the divine Life. And do they not &s;ecretly di&s;like the Conver&s;ation of the Saints, becau&s;e of their &s;trict Holine&s;s, pious and di&s;cover|ing Di&s;cour&s;es, which &s;ometimes gripe their guilty Con&s;ciences; and therefore they care|fully

But in Eternity the Tables will be turned, they &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch Dawnings of Glory and joyous Triumph, in the &s;hining Appearance of the Saints and Angels; as will much heighten their E&s;teem of the Beauty, Splendor, and Delights of that Paradi&s;e, which is made the Seat of their perpetual Re&s;idence; and from which them &s;elves are forever Excluded; this will &s;trike their &s;ofte&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions, and extort their never ending Lamentations! <HI>&s;ee Luk.</HI> XIII. 28. <HI>There &s;hall be Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth</HI> (&s;ays the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us) <HI>When ye &s;hall &s;ee</HI> Abraham, <HI>and</HI> J&s;aac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your &s;elves thru&s;t out.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' their Love to the Saints, will be much the &s;ame then that it is now, <HI>viz.</HI> The Perfection of that hatred; yet for the &s;ake of their own &s;afey they will be de&s;irous to croud in among them whom they now &s;o much di&s;dain, but to no purpo&s;e, the Door is &s;hut, the Gulph is fix'd, they &s;hall not find acce&s;s, <HI>Luk.

<P N="3">3.

An acute Pain but in one Part of our Body makes life a Burden, and it is onely the Hopes of its &s;peedy Expiration, which makes it tolerable; otherwi&s;e if one were a&s;&s;ured that they mu&s;t

<P N="1">1. If not believing the Truth, and having plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, be evils of &s;uch dangerous Con&s;equence, as has been hinted; then it exceedingly concerns us to enquire narrowly into our pre&s;ent practice, and to examine our &s;elves &s;trictly by the Charracters given of &s;uch Per&s;ons from the 87 &mdash; to the 100.

<P N="2">2. May People's Day of Grace expire be|fore their natural Death? &mdash; And after this, will God be gracious no more? &mdash; Then for Chri&s;t's &s;ake be entreated to try your &s;elves, by tho&s;e Signs of an expired Sea&s;on of

<P N="3">3. Are dark Providences &s;ent with &s;uch gracious De&s;igns in re&s;pect of Gods People? As has been hinted, from the 138 to the 146 Page. Then let them be advi&s;ed.</P>

<P N="4">4. Are the De&s;igns of the afore&s;aid Provi|dences, &s;o terrible towards many wicked People, as has been in &s;ome &s;ort repre&s;en|ted? Then truly they have little cau&s;e for that Joy and Satisfaction they u&s;ually (&s;ome of them) expre&s;s upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions? and as little Rea&s;on have they for their malici|ous Reflections, again&s;t the whole Body of Profe&s;&s;ors, for the falls of &s;ome, or divine Judgments inflicted upon others, &s;eeing their Sins are often the meritorious Cau&s;es of the former. <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> XXII. 20.2. <HI>Chron.</HI> XX. 35.37.

<PB N="189" REF="040085_0184_101629AFBB6BCEA8">If wicked Men did but con&s;ult their own In|tere&s;t, they would certainly re&s;train their unrea&s;onable invectives, again&s;t &s;uch who are the Object of Gods peculiar Love and Care. <HI>Zec.</HI> II. 8.

<P N="5">5. Does the Righteous God threaten to &s;end Delu&s;ion, that &s;uch who believe not the Truth, but have plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, may believe a Lie; and be all Damned? Then why &s;hould we wonder to &s;ee this Threatning of the faithful God executed upon the proper Subjects of it, and fullfilled in an Age of &s;uch Impiety as ours is, wherein eve|ry Thing that is worthy of E&s;teem, is treated with Contempt.

<P>To prevent the afore&s;aid Delu&s;ion, and the Dam|nation which follows it, I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;|cour&s;e with the following Councils.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be not contented with the bare Speculative Knowledge of Divine Truths but &s;eek to get them impre&s;&s;ed on your Hearts, and labour to improve them into Practice, which is their great De&s;ign. <HI>Eph.</HI> IV. 21.</P>
<P N="2">2. Endeavour to be well acquainted with the Prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity, with their Grounds and Con|nection; as al&s;o with your own State and Condition towards God, that ye may be able to <HI>render a Rea|&s;on of your Hope,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> III. 15.</P>
<P>To this End ye &s;hould,</P>
<P N="1">1. Read the holy Scriptures reverently and fre|quently, with a Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>learn la&s;truction</HI> from them, <HI>Joh.</HI> V. 39.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be earne&s;t in &s;upplicating the ble&s;&s;ed God, the Source of Truth, that he would <HI>lead you into all Truth</HI> by his Holy Spirit, and keep you from being <HI>turned a&s;ide by every Wind of Doctrine,</HI> and the Craft of tho&s;e <HI>who lie in wait to deceive. Eph.</HI> IV. 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. Labour again&s;t the Pride of your own Under|&s;tanding, which inclines you to di&s;credit tho&s;e Things you cannot comprehend, or gra&s;p in your &s;hallow Capacities. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> III. 18.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="191" REF="040085_0186_101629B5C3C9ECC8">
4. Once more, beware of curious Enquiries into, ha&s;ty Cen&s;ures upon God's Councils, Providences, or afflicted People, le&s;t ye feel the <HI>Beth&s;hemites</HI> Fate, or &s;omething wor&s;e, if wor&s;e can be. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> VI. 19. When you &s;ee the Hand of God upon &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion, afflicting them with Di&s;pair, Madne&s;s, or Death it &s;elf, then let your Fle&s;h tremble for fear of GOD, and be afraid of his Judgements, and won|der that the righteous God hath not hitherto bla&s;ted your rational Powers, and utterly bereaved you of that Rea&s;on, which you have &s;o long abu&s;ed, to the Di&s;honour of its kind Author, and the un&s;peakable Di&s;advantage of its indolent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.

Has the Devil had &s;uch Power over the Bedies of pious People for a Time, as has been proved? Then admire, wicked Sinner, that he has not hitherto torn thee in Pieces, or that he doth not even this Moment Sieze thee, and drag thee quick to Hell! &mdash; What Fence ha&s;t thou to guard thee from his cruel Gripe? None at all, unhappy Creature! but thy fal&s;e Hope! and that is not worth a Ru&s;h!
