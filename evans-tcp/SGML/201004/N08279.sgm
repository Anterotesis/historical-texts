<P>AN EXAMINATION INTO THE PRINCIPLES OF BAPTISM. In a LETTER to the Infant Baptizers of North-Pari&s;h, in NEW-LONDON.</P>

<Q>Behold, I waited for your words, I gave ear to your rea&s;ons, while you &s;earched out what to &s;ay: And &s;earched the &s;criptures daily, to &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN ASMUCH as Bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted by the great King of hea|ven and earth, I &s;hall make no apology for being de&s;irous to know who are the &s;ub|jects of that ordinance: and &s;eeing you would be great lovers of what you call truth, and not de&s;irous that the people &s;hould be in an error, I hope you will not be offended with my making &s;ome remarks on that &s;ubject, and a&s;king a few que&s;tions concerning the chief arguments that I have ever heard u&s;ed by any per&s;on in favor of infant bapti&s;m; and al&s;o in re&s;pect of per&s;ons being de&s;ired, or forced to pay to the &s;upport of a mini&s;try that they have no fellow&s;hip with.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t argument I &s;hall mention, is what is generally u&s;ed to &s;hew that bapti&s;m was in|&s;tituted in the room and &s;tead of circumci&s;ion, and to be admini&s;tred to the &s;ame &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>We have an account in Act. 15 chap. of the judai&s;ing teachers going down to Antioch, and &s;aid, <HI>Except you be circumci&s;ed after the manner of Mo&s;es, ye cannot be &s;aved.</HI> The apo&s;|tles Paul and Barnabas were &s;ent up to the apo&s;tles and elders, about that que&s;tion; who wrote back a letter, in which are the&s;e words.
<PB N="4" REF="010571_0003_0F80D243EEC34870">viz. <HI>It &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen than the&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary things; that ye ab&s;tain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things &s;trangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep your&s;elves, ye &s;hall do well.</HI> Now if bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted in the room and &s;tead of circumci|&s;ion, did not the apo&s;tles know it? And if they knew it, would they not have taught it? Surely as they declared the coun&s;el of God, they would have informed us that bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted in the room of circumci&s;ion. I believe there is none &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;ay the Holy Gho&s;t did not know it; or that he did, and would not reveal it to the apo&s;tles. But in the letter it is &s;aid, <HI>from which if you keep your&s;elves, ye &s;hall do well;</HI> let me a&s;k you, could it be &s;aid, <HI>ye &s;hall do well,</HI> unle&s;s they did all that was required in the room and &s;tead of circumci&s;ion, concerning which they wrote?</P>
<P>Again, it is argued in favor of the pre&s;by|terians, or infant baptizers, that the apo&s;tles practi&s;ed baptizing infants; for they &s;ay hou&s;|holde were baptized, viz. the jailor and his hou&s;hold, Lydia and her hou&s;hold, and the hou&s;hold of Stephanus: they &s;ay probably there was infants baptized in &s;ome one or other of the&s;e hou&s;holds. But let us con&s;ider of the probability.&mdash;As to the jailor we are told, Act. 16.34. <HI>That be rejoiced, believing in God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> all his hou&s;e.</HI> Now if they were believ|ers,
<PB N="5" REF="010571_0004_0F80D244BB82E8B8">as is evident they was, they were proper &s;ubject, of bapti&s;m, as appears by Philip's an&s;wer to the Ethiop an that reque&s;ted bap|ti&s;m, &s;ee Act 8 37. <HI>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou may&s;t:</HI> Which plainly &s;hews that faith in Chri&s;t was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to be admitted to the ordinance of bapti&s;m, &s;ee al&s;o, Act. 10 47. <HI>Can any man forbid water that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized which have received the Holy Gho&s;t as well as we?</HI> Which plainly &s;hews that the receiving the Holy Gho&s;t was an evidence of faith in Chri&s;t, and the rule upon which they were admitted to the ordinance of Bapti&s;m. But to return: As to Lydia, if we believe the &s;criptures, &s;ay|ing <HI>her</HI> hou&s;hold; &s;he had no hu&s;band; for if &s;he had, it would have been &s;aid HIS hou&s;|hold, and not <HI>her</HI> hou&s;hold: and it is not half the virgins and widows that have hou&s;holds, that have children in them &s;o &s;mall, that if they had faith in Chri&s;t, it could not be known. Be&s;ides, what would &s;he do with infants tending her &s;hop? Again, we find in Act. 16 40. <HI>And when they had &s;een the bre|thren, they comforted them and departed.</HI> Now then if the&s;e brethren are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in|fants, how, and with what did the apo&s;tles comfort them? Upon the whole, it is evident that &s;he had no children in her hou&s;hold, but &s;uch as could and did make a profe&s;&s;ion before they were baptized.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the hou&s;hold of Ste|phanus,
<PB N="6" REF="010571_0005_0F80D2455DEBB2D0">&s;ee 1 Cor. 16.15, 16. <HI>I be&s;eech you brethren, ye know the hou&s;e of Stephanus, that it is the fir&s;t fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted them&s;elves to the mini&s;try of the &s;aints; that ye &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto &s;uch.</HI> Now from the time of the writting this fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, back to Paul's preaching at Co|rinth, was but about five years, as appears by the dates in the bible. Now then, if the hou&s;hold of Stephanus were baptized in infan|cy, they mu&s;t have been in the mini&s;try over the church, at about &s;ix or &s;even years of age, which I think is exceeding unlikely.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k you, if the apo&s;tles had con|&s;tantly practi&s;ed baptizing infants, is it not much more probable there would have been &s;ome direct account of it, &s;ome where in the new te&s;tament, than that there was infants baptized in &s;ome one or other of the&s;e hou&s;|holds? Where were the infants of the three thou&s;and that came together to &s;ee that &s;trange thing? As it is in the eyes of all unconverted people, to &s;ee the Holy Gho&s;t poured out up|on the apo&s;tles, do you think they brought their infants with them to be baptized, or no? No, it is evident they did not; as may be &s;hewn pre&s;ently. But why do I talk thus of probabilities; let us prove from &s;cripture what the apo&s;tles practice was; re-con&s;ider and &s;ee Gal 3 27. <HI>As many of you as have been baptized into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t.</HI> Says the Rev. Mr. Fi&s;h, on the text, <Q>That as, in your
<PB N="7" REF="010571_0006_0F80D245DFF35628">bapti&s;m, you put on the character of chri&s;|tians, you declared or profe&s;s'd, that you received Chri&s;t as your Lord and Saviour.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See his &s;ermons. pag. 37.</NOTE></Q> And I verily believe the gentleman was quite right; for I cannot believe, that to put on Chri&s;t, can mean any thing le&s;s than that they were true believers in Chri&s;t. Now then, if as many, or all of them that were baptized, had made their profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o that it was evi|dent they had faith in Chri&s;t, then the apo&s;|tles did not baptize children that made no profe&s;&s;ion: nor is there any believers that dare declare that all their infants have faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The third argument is drawn from Act. 15.10 <HI>Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the di&s;ciples?</HI> Here they &s;ay, ina&s;much as it appears from the chapter, that the yoke was circumci&s;ion which they would have laid upon children at eight days old, infants are called di&s;ciples in the &s;crip|ture, and therefore they are &s;o, and have a right to be baptized by the commi&s;&s;ion, Mat. 28.19. where di&s;ciples are ordered to be baptized, tho' the word children or infants is not mentioned.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k you why you do not admit infants to the Lord's table, ina&s;much as our Saviour tells us in Mat. 26.27. <HI>Drink ye all off it.</HI> Is not that as much an in&s;titution for di&s;|ciples as bapti&s;m? Do you indeed keep ordi|nances
<PB N="8" REF="010571_0007_0F80D2469D0CFF18">according to your own mind?</P>
<P>But for an&s;wer, I &s;ay the word <HI>why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the di&s;ciples,</HI> doth not conclude, that all on whom they would have laid that yoke, were di&s;ciples. The church of Antioch was a Gentile church, &s;ee Act. 21.25 the believers in it bad not been circumci&s;ed; &s;o that the putting the yoke upon the neck of the believers of the church of Antioch, of whom they &s;pake, was putting a yoke upon the neck of the di&s;ciples; altho' there might be thou&s;ands of infants, or others which were not di&s;ciples, on whom they would have laid that yoke. This will appear to be the true meaning of this text, if it is compa|red with our Saviour's explanation of the word DISCIPLE, &s;ee Luk. 14 27. <HI>And who&s;oever doth not bear his cro&s;s, and come after me, can|not be my di&s;ciple.</HI> Now did all the infants of the church of Antioch, and do all infants of all believers, take up their cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t? Ver. 26 <HI>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, yea and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</HI> Did, and do all the infants of believers, love God to that degree that their love to their fathers and mothers, and to their own lives, when in com|petition to their love to God, is but hatred? Of if you do not like my explanation, do all the infants of all believers hate their fathers and mothers, and their own lives, with a perfect hatred?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010571_0008_0F80D2475F5CF9F8">
The fourth argument is drawn from Acts 2. and part of the 38 and 39 ver&s;es. <HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you&mdash;For the promi&s;e is to you and to your children.</HI> Here they argue that the promi&s;e was mentioned as an encouragement to both parents and children, to be baptized. I an&s;wer, that the promi&s;e is mentioned as an encouragement to them to repent, and be bap|tized; but not that they &s;hould be baptized without repentance. But as true repentance cannot be, without true faith, this text is another in&s;tance of true faith's being a rule, in order to be admitted to bapti&s;m. E&s;pecially when com|pared with the la&s;t part of the &s;ame ver&s;e. <HI>Re|pent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Here I would a&s;k, was there ever a promi&s;e of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and of the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, made to bap|ti&s;m without repentance? if not, then the pro|mi&s;e they &s;peak of could be no encouragement to bapti&s;m without repentance. Again we &s;ee in the chapter the&s;e jewi&s;h believers were bap|ti&s;ed them&s;elves; but did they have their chil|dren baptized. NO. It is evident they did not, for we &s;ee ver&s;e 42, they continued &s;ted|fa&s;tly in the apo&s;tles doctrine: But they conti|nued &s;teadfa&s;tly in the practice of circumci&s;ing their children, therefore that was the apo&s;tles doctrine, &s;ee Acts 21.20. <HI>And they were all zealous of the law:</HI> that is the law of circumci|&s;ion, as appears from the 21&s;t ver&s;e. And they al&s;o advi&s;ed St. Paul to &s;hew the jewi&s;h believ|ers,
<PB N="10" REF="010571_0009_0F80D2482537C560">that he kept that law, as in ver&s;e 24. To circumci&s;e the children therefore, was the apo&s;t|les doctrine and the jewi&s;h believers practice. But if bapti&s;m was appointed in the room and &s;tead of circumci&s;ion, then circumci&s;ion mu&s;t have cea&s;ed, and would have been no more an in&s;titution, than if it never had been in&s;tituted. Now to &s;et up circumci&s;ion as a &s;eal after that, without divine warrant: was to &s;et up a &s;eal of their own in oppo&s;ition to that which God had &s;et up. Pray what manner of men do they make of the apo&s;tles, were they the vile&s;t of men? &s;urely no.</P>
<P>The fifth argument is drawn from Mark 10.14, 15. I do not remember any account of our Saviour's being di&s;plea&s;ed, but when &s;omething was &s;aid, which tended to hinder the channels of his mercy to poor peri&s;hing &s;inners. But I &s;uppo&s;e no one will deny that tho&s;e children were brought to Chri&s;t to plead for mercy: likely their parents were poor and de&s;pi&s;ed in the world; perhaps the di&s;ciples therefore, tho't it below their ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, to take notice of &s;uch mi&s;erable creatures, as likely they appeared to be. But our Saviour &s;oon corrects their mi&s;|take; and &s;ays he, <HI>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of God.</HI> I under&s;tand it is, as if he had &s;aid, tho&s;e children are in a deplorable con|dition, polluted with &s;in, and expo&s;ed to the everla&s;ting wrath of God. Hinder them not from coming to me for mercy. In me is a full|ne&s;s whereby is &s;u&s;tained the whole kingdom of God.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010571_0010_0F80D248E2D8BEF0">
But they argue from the words, <HI>&s;uffer little children to come unto me, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of God.</HI> That &s;ome little children belong to the kingdom of God, and therefore have a right to church-member&s;hip and its ordinance. But why do they &s;ay &s;ome children? I never knew them to argue that the children that were brought to Chri&s;t, were children of believing parents. But I believe tho&s;e per&s;ons that brought the&s;e chil|dren to Chri&s;t, were converted per&s;ons; and as it is truly every one's duty to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures to know what is their duty, and not to pin their faith upon other men's &s;leeves without evidence, I am willing you &s;hould make the be&s;t of your arguments; I will therefore give you the rea&s;on why I think &s;o. &mdash; But to re|turn &mdash; Ob&s;erve the word, <HI>of &s;uch is the king|dom of God:</HI> here is an ALL implied: &mdash;the king|dom means all the kingdom. Does it not? Is the kingdom of God made up of &s;uch infants? Have all the infants of believing parents an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t by faith? If there be evidence of that, then they are proper &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m; but if not, how do they belong to the kingdom of God? But if you would have it, that by the kingdom of God is meant church-member&s;hip, our Saviour tells you in the next ver&s;e, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he &s;hall not enter therein.</HI> &mdash; And can no per&s;on enter into your church, un|le&s;s he receive it as a little child? You will an|&s;wer, doubtle&s;s they can and do.</P>
<P>But I come now to let you know, why I think
<PB N="12" REF="010571_0011_0F80D24AA0C0A0D8">tho&s;e per&s;ons that brought the children to Chri&s;t, were converted per&s;ons. When any per&s;on (at a time) is under the operation of the Spirit of God, and is brought to &s;ee that the puni&s;hment, eternal mi&s;ery! is, if any thing, much le&s;s than he de&s;erves; oh! now he is amazed at the mer|cy of God! that he is not &s;ent into the eternal torments of hell, Lev. 26.41. Ezek. 36.31. Now if his heart cries to God for mercy, God does &s;hew him&s;elf, in and through Chri&s;t, Joh. 17.3. and chap 6.40. to be more willing to forgive him, than any of you could be to pull an only &s;on, or your deare&s;t friend on earth out of the flaming fire, if he lay &s;creaming there. For <HI>we all with open face beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image.</HI> Now if tho&s;e that brought the children to Chri&s;t, had not been made thus to know Chri&s;t, likely they would, with the unconverted multitude of that age, have called him the carpenter's &s;on; or with the topping phari&s;ees of them times, who were not willing that Chri&s;t &s;hould preach, have demanded by what authority, and have &s;aid <HI>this fellow, &amp;c.</HI> and not have come to him for a ble&s;&s;ing upon their children. But the word <HI>(at a time)</HI> was put becau&s;e mo&s;t people think they have known their puni&s;hment for &s;in was ju&s;t, ever &s;ince they came to the years of under&s;tand|ing, altho' their heart ri&s;es up again&s;t it, and thinks hard of the puni&s;hment. This is what &s;ome call an hi&s;torical knowledge, or learnt by man, and is not of the operation of the &s;pirit of God. Job 36.22. <HI>Behold God exalteth by his power, who teacheth like him?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010571_0012_0F80D24B1C8D3440">
Again, if they &s;hould &s;ay they have had the &s;ame lively &s;en&s;e of it always, ever &s;ince they had an under&s;tanding, I &s;hould think it was on|ly the &s;ame hi&s;torical knowledge which is com|mon to all natural men of under&s;tanding, and not from the Spirit of God, Song 3.4. and 5.4.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth argument is taken from 1 Cor. 7.14. <HI>And the unbelieving wife is &s;anctified by the hu&s;band, el&s;e were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</HI> Here they a&s;k what holine&s;s this can mean, if it is not &s;uch an holine&s;s as intitles the chil|dren to bapti&s;m? To which I an&s;wer, that it may be &s;uch an holine&s;s as the children of I&s;rael had, on account of which they were called an holy people, an holy nation, &amp;c. which was an holine&s;s that did entitle them to circumci&s;ion, but now to ab&s;tinence from meats offered to idols, &amp;c. but not to bapti&s;m. Bapti&s;m is a profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, that he has faith in Chri&s;t. See Col. 2.12. <HI>Being buried with him in bapti&s;m; wherein al&s;o ye are ri&s;en with him thro' the faith.</HI> Says the Rev. Mr Fi&s;h, in his &s;ermons, p. 41. <Q>As if he had &s;aid, in and by your bapti&s;m, you &s;ignify and declare, that your old man, the body of &s;in, is crucified with Chri&s;t.</Q> Then how can the body of &s;in be crucified with Chri&s;t, without faith in him? But was circumci&s;ion a profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t? The an&s;wer is, No: it was ordered to be admini&s;tred to the males of the &s;ojourner a|mong the children of I&s;rael, who had a mind to keep the pa&s;&s;over, and to all the males of the children of I&s;rael. Were the&s;e all converted
<PB N="14" REF="010571_0013_0F80D24E6C4E4518">per&s;ons? &s;uch as could in truth profe&s;s that they were true believers in Chri&s;t? Do you think that God ordered or directed his people to be fal&s;e? But &s;ays the Rev. Mr. Par&s;ons, in his book, intitled, <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m vindicated,</HI> p. 28. <Q>Circumci&s;ion &s;ignified putting off the &s;ins of the fle&s;h and &s;o does bapti&s;m, Colo&s;. 2.11.</Q> This text doth not &s;ay that circumci&s;ion made with hands, did &s;ignify that the &s;ubjects of it had put off the &s;ins of the fle&s;h: but Abraham did not circumci&s;e without hands. Did circum|ci&s;ion &s;ignify that the &s;ubjects of it had put off the &s;ins of the fle&s;h? No. Circumci&s;ion was given to teach faith in Chri&s;t, and was a &s;eal of the promi&s;e that God would ju&s;tify &s;uch as had or &s;hould have faith in Chri&s;t, &s;ee Gal 3.8&mdash;29. <HI>And the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith, preached before the go&s;pel unto Abraham, &s;aying, in thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed. And if ye be Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abra|ham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e.</HI> Thus circumci&s;ion was a token, a&s;&s;urance, or &s;eal, that God would ju&s;tify Abraham, ina&s;much as he had faith in Chri&s;t, tho' it was before he was circumci&s;ed, Rom. 4 11. But does not bapti&s;m &s;ignify that the &s;ubjects of it had put off the &s;ins of the fle&s;h? Why then did the apo&s;tles require faith in Chri&s;t, as a rule for their admini&s;tring the ordinance of bapti&s;m? You don't pretend that the commi&s;&s;ion, Mat. 28.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">9 authorized the apo&s;tles to baptize any but di&s;ciples; and they are &s;uch as are true believers in Chri&s;t, if I can under&s;tand our Saviour's explanation of
<PB N="15" REF="010571_0014_0F80D24F316F9038">the word <HI>Di&s;ciple,</HI> in the 14th chapter of Luke. Will not God's &s;aying in Jer. 31.31, 32. <HI>I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah: Not according to the co|venant that I made with their fathers,</HI> convince you that there is a difference between the new church-covenant, and that made with Abraham; altho' the new excels, yet that made with Abra|ham was great. Although the apo&s;tle Paul, writing to the Roman church, &s;ays, 2 chap. 26. <HI>Shall not his uncircumci&s;ion be counted for circum|ci&s;ion?</HI> Such as have faith in Chri&s;t will be ju&s;ti|fied, when one that is circumci&s;ed, not having faith in Chri&s;t, will be condemned. He in the 3d chap v.i &s;ays, <HI>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumci&s;ion?</HI> ver. 2. <HI>Chiefly, becau&s;e that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</HI> A great gift this, which taught the main errand of the bible, viz. Faith in Chri&s;t. But oh! how &s;lothful is man, that he mu&s;t be whipt with the yoke of circumci&s;ion, to make him remember him&s;elf, and to teach his children. <HI>O the depth of the riches hath of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God! How un&s;earchable are his judg|ments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out. To whom be glory forever.</HI> Amen. Rom. 11.33.36.</P>

<P>IT is argued by &s;ome, in favor of believers bap|ti&s;m, from Acts 8.38, 39. that both Philip and the Eunuch went down into the water, and came up out of the water; from whence they &s;ay it is evident that the Eunuch was baptized by dipping.</P>
<P>This is an&s;wered by &s;ome, in favor of &s;prink|ling for bapti&s;m, that the Greek prepo&s;ition (<HI>ek</HI>) here rendered <HI>out of,</HI> properly &s;ignifies <HI>from.</HI> To which for an&s;wer I &s;ay, that the word <HI>from.</HI> being alone, has no &s;ignification at all. If I &s;hould meet you in the &s;treet, and &s;ay <HI>from,</HI> what could you know by it? <HI>Ek,</HI> therefore of it&s;elf, or with &s;ome additional word, mu&s;t &s;ignify <HI>from</HI> the place where they were. Now if the place where they were was <HI>in</HI> the water, then the old tran&s;lators were right in &s;aying <HI>out of the water;</HI> for to &s;ay <HI>from in the water,</HI> is not good Engli&s;h, although it would have the &s;ame meaning: but if the place where they were was <HI>at</HI> the water, then the&s;e new tran&s;lators. Wherefore the ar|gument turns upon the Greck prepo&s;ition, <HI>eis,</HI> which they &s;ay in the place under con&s;ideration, was rendered <HI>into,</HI> and naturally &s;ignifies <HI>unto,</HI> and is commonly &s;o u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament. Thus Mat. 15.24. <HI>Unto the lo&s;t &s;heep.</HI> Joh. 13.1. <HI>Unto the end.</HI> Joh. 7.8. <HI>Unto the fea&s;t.</HI> 1 The&s; 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Our go&s;pel came not unto you.</HI> But if the Greek word <HI>eis,</HI> &s;ignified <HI>unto,</HI> and did not &s;ignify <HI>into,</HI> why did they not tell us what Greek word &s;ig|nified
<PB N="17" REF="010571_0016_0F80D2506C1B2340"><HI>into,</HI> &s;o that we might have &s;een the diffe|rence. But ca&s;ting my eyes into a Greek te&s;ta|ment, where in the text under con&s;ideration, Act. 8.38. the apo&s;tle has written <HI>eis to;</HI> now if they &s;hew us that <HI>eis to,</HI> was always tran&s;lated <HI>unto,</HI> and never tran&s;lated <HI>into,</HI> and that &s;ome other Greek word was always tran&s;lated <HI>into,</HI> and never tran&s;lated <HI>unto,</HI> I &s;hall believe the old tran&s;lators were wrong then, and never till then. Thus they have utterly failed of &s;hewing that the old tran&s;|lators were wrong. How, when in the text un|der con&s;ideration, the Greek is <HI>eis to,</HI> do they think to convince us by &s;aying that <HI>eis</HI> alone &s;ig|nified <HI>unto?</HI> Neverthele&s;s in my ob&s;ervation, there is ver&s;es in &s;cripture wherein there is <HI>into</HI> in Engli&s;h, and only <HI>eis</HI> in Greek. Thus the Greek, in Acts 16.40. there is <HI>eis,</HI> the Engli&s;h in that text is, <HI>and entered into the hou&s;e of Lydia;</HI> and in Rev. 17.11. there is <HI>eis,</HI> in Engli&s;h, <HI>into perdi|tion:</HI> which gives me rea&s;on to think that the Greclans, when they intended <HI>into,</HI> wrote <HI>eis to,</HI> unle&s;s where there was a word in the text that forced the &s;en&s;e, <HI>into,</HI> as in the fir&s;t of the&s;e in|&s;tances ENTERED, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that they entered the hou&s;e, and did not go in: &s;o in the &s;econd in&s;tance, the bea&s;t could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to go <HI>to</HI> perdition, and not go <HI>into</HI> perdition. The like ob&s;ervation I have in our own language in many in&s;tances: &s;ee 1 Sam. 1.21. <HI>And the man Elkanah, and all his hou&s;e, went up to offer.</HI> What per&s;on of &s;en&s;e can &s;uppo&s;e that Elkanah went up with his hou&s;e to offer, and left all his people at home. But what if the text had declared,
<PB N="18" REF="010571_0017_0F80D2511FC93500">that Elkanah's hou&s;e was all of a light fire, would you have &s;uppo&s;ed his people were all of a blaze, and burnt like tinder? Is not the like done by tho&s;e people, with re&s;pect to the Greek word, <HI>hudata polla,</HI> which they &s;ay &s;ignifies <HI>many waters,</HI> altho' it is tran&s;lated <HI>much water,</HI> &s;ee Joh. 3.23. <HI>And John was baptizing in Enon, near to Salem, becau&s;e there was much water there.</HI> Had John any need to baptize in Enon, becau&s;e there was much water there, when a &s;mall vial full of water would baptize an hundred, according to your mode of &s;prinkling? Surely now if the people had water to drink, they might have ea&s;ily &s;pa|red two drops to put in their face, for that would be &s;prinkling; for they &s;ay it is not in the quan|tity of water which they baptize with: but they &s;ay they went unto Enon, to get drink for them|&s;elves and their hor&s;es. Who ever took a jour|ney to Enon to get drink for him&s;elf and his hor&s;e, and all his other creatures at home, had a &s;ufficiency and to &s;pare, &s;o had no need to drive them. But they baptized in Enon, becau&s;e there was much water there, or water &s;ufficient to plunge the &s;ubject in. But they further &s;ay in favor of &s;prinkling, that it appears from Acts 2. 41. that there was three thou&s;and baptized at Jeru&s;alem in one day, (mo&s;t certainly towards the clo&s;e of the day) and was there any proba|bility that they all &s;hould be baptized by dipping in &s;o &s;hort a time? I do not under&s;tand the text, that they were baptized that day, but that they were added that day. Now when per&s;ons are converted, they do in heart give up them&s;elves
<PB N="19" REF="010571_0018_0F80D25262CB3230">&s;olemnly, voluntarily and freely to God, as their king to rule and reign over them, and to obey all his commands, which teaches them every duty to their brother or brethren. Bapti&s;m therefore is a renewing and &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of this covenant, and is to be complied with as &s;oon as may be. 1 John 2.19 <HI>They went our from us, but they were not of us.</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e here &s;poken of were baptized per&s;ons, yet they were not of the apo&s;tles or children of God, becau&s;e they were not converted per&s;ons, there|fore they were not of them. Ergo, bapti&s;m is not adding. Jer. 31.33. <HI>But this &s;hall be the co|venant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, After tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</HI> It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that God never conver|ted a per&s;on before, but that this &s;hould be the rule of church-membering in the new church-covenant, a covenant which is not according to the old national church-covenant, in which they had to teach every man his brother. This &s;hews that they did not all know the Lord, which were in the old covenant, ver. 32. But with re&s;pect to the new covenant, how &s;oon was it declared, that Simon the &s;orcerer had neither part nor lot in the matter when it was found that his heart was not right in the &s;ight of God, Act. 8.21. further &s;ee Act. 2.47. <HI>And the Lord added to the church daily, &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved,</HI> and not that the apo&s;tles added them. Therefore the text, a and 41 of Acts, doth not prove but they were baptized the next day, or onwards.</P>

Again, if the word of God, as recorded in the original languages, is wrong tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h tongue, then that which is wrong can|not be the word of God. But the truth contain|ed in the bible is proved by many witne&s;&s;es, that as it is now tran&s;lated it is the word of God. For there is no per&s;on who has been converted in the path way or line of the go&s;pel, but what knows a&s;&s;uredly that the bible is the word of God. But if you &s;hould tell me that there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in &s;cripture which are not thus proved, I would tell you for an&s;wer, that the tran&s;lators were not men that were then carrying on arguments in favor of their own party: but as they were men of the greate&s;t knowledge in the tongues that were then to be found in the nation, and doubtle&s;s were va&s;tly &s;uperior to any of our learned men that pretend in this day to correct them, and that they did tran&s;late <HI>into,</HI> &amp;c. from the &s;ame Greek word that they u&s;ed to tran&s;late <HI>into</HI> from; therefore; I &s;hall believe them, if a thou&s;and reverends tells me to the contrary. But if the&s;e men may tran&s;late the bible as they plea&s;e, what argument can they not gain? And now it appears from Acts 8 38.39. that &s;prinkling is not according to the initituti|on: and it al&s;o appears by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in the foregoing, that the the infants of believers, as &s;uch, are not the &s;ubjects of the in&s;titution. Nor can they &s;ay they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> covenant, as in Mat. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.19. <HI>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, and of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> according to the in&s;titution. Now if it were comanded of
<PB N="21" REF="010571_0020_0F80D1161EAAC0F8">believers, why they do not comply with the in&s;titution? Will it do to &s;ay, &s;ome mini&s;ter or other pretended to baptize me? And what el&s;e can they &s;ay? &mdash; Now, that we may find what is the TRUTH, and practice accordingly, is the &s;incere de&s;ire of</P>

<P>Thus I have made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on every argument re&s;pecting bapti&s;m, that I think worthy of notice; but give me leave to mention one which I think not worth notice, which was expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>That doctrine which infers all infants to be in the vi&s;ible kingdom of &s;atan, is certainly fal&s;e doctrine: &mdash;But the doctrine that denies all infants to be members of the vi&s;ible church, infers them to be members of the vi&s;ible kingdom of &s;atan; therefore it is fal&s;e doctrine.</Q> I hope this argument was not put to make people think that bapti&s;m was regene|ration, nor to &s;care &s;ome old woman or other into their principle. But in an&s;wer, I &s;uppo&s;e you won't pretend that &s;atan has a kingdom upon earth, into which he takes in and ca&s;ts out members: but they who &s;ubmit to bapti&s;m without a right, are more expo&s;ed to the king|dom of &s;atan than tho&s;e who are not baptized at all; for they who are not true believers in Chri&s;t, not having their wills bowed, will certainly be rejected of Chri&s;t, while they who are true be|lievers in Chri&s;t, will be received to glory, babtized or not.

<P>NOW &s;uffer me to &s;ay &s;omething re&s;pecting the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of compelling the people of one per&s;ua&s;ion to hear or &s;upport the mini&s;ters of another. Can a per&s;on who has been redeemed, be &s;o ungrateful as to hire a mini&s;ter to preach up a doctrine which in his heart he believes to be directly contrary to the in&s;titution of his redeemer? Now if one of you &s;hould happen to be in company with a number of Roman Catholicks, who &s;hould tell you that if you would not hire a mini&s;ter to preach up tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and the wor&s;hip|ping of images to your children and to an un|thinking people, they would cut off your head; could you do it? Can you any better &s;ubmit to hire a mini&s;ter to preach up a doctrine which you in your heart believe directly contrary to the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t? I do not doubt but that many of you, and do not know but that all of you know what it is to experience redeeming love: and if &s;o, how can you take a per&s;on of another per&s;ua&s;ion, and put him in goal for a trifling &s;um, de&s;troy his e&s;tate and ruin his fa|mily (as you &s;ignify the law will bear you out) when he is careful to &s;upport the religion which he in his con&s;cience looks upon to be right, who hone&s;tly tells you it is wronging his con&s;cience to pay to your mini&s;ter, and that he may not do it though he &s;uffer?
