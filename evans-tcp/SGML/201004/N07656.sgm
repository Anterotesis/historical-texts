<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the Pamphlets you &s;ent me on the Differences in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> none &s;urpriz'd me &s;o much as that entitled, "<HI>A Letter from</HI> Charles Read, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the Ho|nourable</HI> John Ladd, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR>"&mdash;When I con|&s;ider this Letter either as the Production of the Secretary or Judge, I am amazed to think how it came into print. As Secretary, it was out of his Province to write &s;uch a Letter to Ju&s;tices; he had nothing more to do, than to &s;ignify his Excellency's Orders of Protection; and had the Governor not thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to give any Account of the Di&s;turbances
<PB N="4" REF="009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330">in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Letter-Writer &s;hould have &s;aid &s;o, and delivered the Governor's Sentiments, and not his Own.&mdash; As a Judge there is no Excu&s;e; and it grieves me to think that a Ju&s;tice of the Supream Court, &s;hould &s;o far forget him&s;elf, as to give his Opinion upon Hear-&s;ay, and brand People with the Name of MURDERERS, upon bare Report.</P>
<P>The Letter has a mo&s;t extraordinary Begin|ning: I &s;hould be glad to know who the <HI>&s;ome Per&s;ons of good Character in Philadelphia,</HI> are, upon who&s;e Application the Governor &s;o readily granted his Licence and Protection for <HI>&s;ome</HI> Indians to re&s;ide in this Province; and who tho&s;e Indians are, that we are told, <HI>"have been always in the Engli&s;h Intere&s;t."</HI></P>
<P>The Letter-Writer certainly knows: Why did he not then &s;peak out? I am &s;ure indif|ferent Men will think it very &s;trange to en|deavour to intere&s;t Magi&s;trates in Favour of
<PB N="5" REF="009774_0003_0F7A563EE49A9330">Indians, by Invectives again&s;t Men they are Strangers to, as well as to the Motives of their Conduct.</P>
<P>Any Application from private Per&s;ons, of ever &s;o good Character, in my Opinion, was not a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to i&s;&s;ue an Order of Go|vernment for the Protection of Indians, charg|ed with high Crimes, by the Inhabitants of the Frontier-Counties of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> The People will judge for them&s;elves; and when they know that the Government of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> did not apply, but that the&s;e Indians ought to be in the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> they will naturally con&s;true this Letter as a preme|ditated Thing, and an entering voluntarily on one Side of a Que&s;tion, and giving a par|tial Judgment again&s;t a Number of Men, on the bare Word of <HI>&s;ome</HI> Per&s;ons who are not known, in favour of <HI>&s;ome</HI> Indians, who may be Enemies, for ought we know</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0">
But to brand a People with the Name of MURDERERS&mdash;to repre&s;ent them in a State of Infatuation&mdash;to charge them with Crimes of the blacke&s;t Dye, &s;urely requir'd better Evi|dence than bare Report; and plainly &s;hews that the Letter-Writer had inli&s;ted him&s;elf as Advocate in a Matter and Mea&s;ures wherein the Province was not in the lea&s;t concerned, but he determined to &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>"Weak Minds are apt to be inflamed,"</HI> he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>"on reading an Article in the Gazette, of a few Per&s;ons being killed by In|dians, &amp;c."</HI>&mdash; And no Wonder, as the Indian Mode of War is horrid, and their Cruelty &s;hocking: But this is the fir&s;t Time I have ever heard it palliated, and that generous Ardor that is rai&s;ed on the Report of Indian Inroads, (which, if properly directed, would cha&s;ti&s;e Indian In&s;olence) &s;tiled <HI>a Weakne&s;s</HI> of Mind, and lowered to a Ferment rather di&s;|graceful to Human Nature. At the &s;ame
<PB N="7" REF="009774_0004_0F7A56408DD74DF0">Time he confe&s;&s;es the Affair at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> has rai&s;ed his <HI>Re&s;entment;</HI> whether it is a Proof of the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of his Mind, I leave to him to determine. This he mu&s;t allow, that the People have as good a Right to judge as him|&s;elf; and it may be feared they will not im|pute <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> to him only.</P>
<P>But he has drawn his Pen not &s;o much to &s;ignify the Governor's Orders, as to write profe&s;&s;edly in Favour of Mea&s;ures that can|not be ju&s;tify'd; and has not he&s;itated to con|demn without Evidence, and to &s;peak of In|dians in a Manner none can approve.</P>
<P>Had he reflected ever &s;o little on the pre|&s;ent Affairs, he mu&s;t have found that it was not a Time to cry up Indian Numbers, when we are ju&s;tly arming to &s;courge them for their In&s;olence and Cruelty: He would have found that &s;uch Stories might di&s;courage the inli&s;t|ing Men for the Campaign; and that when the People hear, from his Pen, that &s;uch are the Indians and the Situation of their Coun|try, that half a Million of Men (for of &s;o many as lea&s;t con&s;i&s;ted the Armies on all
<PB N="8" REF="009774_0005_0F7A56412A78E8D8">Sides the la&s;t War) are not able to effect their Ruin, might it not naturally follow that our People may be backward to inli&s;t and di&s;pirited when led to the Field: Con|&s;equently he &s;hould have attended to, and con&s;ider'd, before he blindly e&s;pou&s;ed a Party, and a&s;&s;erted Facts he can have no Evidence to &s;upport: But his over Zeal has prevented the bad Effects his round A&s;&s;ertion might otherwi&s;e have produced.</P>
<P>There are many other Things in this ex|traordinary Letter which I would take No|tice of, but I have exceeded the Bounds I pre&s;cribed, which nothing could have induce|ed me to, but the Regard I have for <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and my real Sorrow to &s;ee the Authority of its Government pro&s;tituted, to &s;upport a Party in the Protection of Indians in this Province, which they found them&s;elves un|able to do in their own.</P>
