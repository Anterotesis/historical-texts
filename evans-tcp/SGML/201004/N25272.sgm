<P>THE events related in the following pages, naturally became a frequent &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation with my children and my friends. They felt &s;o much &s;atisfaction at the accounts which I gave them, that they repeatedly urged me to com|mit the whole to paper; and their affectionate par|tiality induced them to &s;uppo&s;e, that the narrative would be, not only agreeable to them, but intere&s;t|ing to the public. In complying with their &s;olici|tations, I am far from being confident that the &s;ucce&s;s of my efforts will ju&s;tify their hopes: I tru&s;t, however, that too much will not be expect|ed, in regard to literary compo&s;ition, from a per&s;on who&s;e life has been principally devoted to the duties of a &s;oldier and the &s;ervice of his country&mdash; and that a &s;crupulous adherence to truth will com|pen&s;ate for many blemi&s;hes in &s;tyle and arrange|ment.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE tenderne&s;s of a fond father's heart admoni&s;hes me, that I &s;hould but poorly requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the affectionate &s;olicitude you have &s;o often expre&s;&s;ed, to become acquainted with the particulars of my jour|ney over land to India, if I any longer with-held from you an account of that &s;ingular and eventful period of my life. I confe&s;s to you, my dear boy, that often when I have endeavoured to amu&s;e you with the leading incidents and extraordinary vici&s;|&s;itudes of fortune which chequered the whole of that &s;eries of adventures, and ob&s;erved the eager attention with which, young though you were, you li&s;tened to the recital, the tender &s;en&s;ibility you di&s;|clo&s;ed at &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, and the earne&s;t de&s;ire you expre&s;&s;ed that "I &s;hould the whole relate," I have felt an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to indulge you with an accurate and faithful narrative, and have more than once &s;at down at my bureau for the pur|po&s;e: but &s;ober and deliberate reflection &s;ugge&s;ted that it was too &s;oon, and that, by complying with your de&s;ire at &s;uch a very early period of your life, I &s;hould but render the great end I propo&s;ed by it
<PB N="14" REF="033487_0013_0FF72210AB67A220">
abortive, fru&s;trate the in&s;truction which I meant to convey, and impre&s;s the mere incident on your memory, while the moral deducible from it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily evaporate, and leave no trace, or rather excite no idea, in a mind not &s;ufficiently matured for the conception of ab&s;tract principles, or prepared by practice for the deduction of moral inferences.</P>
<P>I am aware that there are many people, who, contemplating only the number of your days, would con&s;ider my undertaking this arduous ta&s;k, and offer|ing it to your reflection, even now, premature: but this is a &s;ubject on which I have &s;o long and &s;o deliberately dwelt, which I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with &s;o much care, and examined with &s;uch impartiality, that I think I may be acquitted of vanity, though I &s;ay I am competent to form a judgment on it. The re&s;ult of that judgment is, that I am determined to indulge you without further delay; and I tru&s;t that you will not, on your part, render it an empty indulgence, but, on the contrary, by turning every circum&s;tance to its be&s;t u&s;e, by converting every feeling which the&s;e pages may excite in your heart into matter of &s;erious reflection, and by making every event (as it happens to de&s;erve) an example to promote either emulation on the one hand, or circum&s;pection and caution on the other, ju&s;tify me in that opinion of you on which I found this de|termination.</P>
<P>I remember, that when, at an early age, I entered upon that &s;tage of cla&s;&s;ical education at which you are now, at an earlier age, arrived&mdash;I mean the Aeneid&mdash;I was not only captivated with the beauti|ful &s;tory of the Hero, in the &s;econd Book, but drew certain inferences from parts of it, which I &s;hall never forget, and which afterwards &s;erved to give a direction to the growth of my &s;entiments on occa|&s;ions of a &s;imilar nature: above all, the filial piety of Aeneas made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, and,
<PB N="15" REF="033487_0014_0FF722123B3B6FD8">
by imperceptibly exciting emulation in my bo&s;om, augmented con&s;iderably the natural warmth of my affection and re&s;pect for my father. It is under the recollection of this &s;en&s;ation, and a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that your heart is fully as &s;u&s;ceptible of every tender impre&s;&s;ion, and your under&s;tanding as fit for the reception of u&s;eful hi&s;tory, as mine was then, that I overlook your extreme youth, and write to you as though you were an adult. If there be a thing on earth of which I can boa&s;t a perfect knowledge, it is my FREDERICK'S heart: it has been the object of my uninterrupted &s;tudy almo&s;t &s;ince it was fir&s;t capable of manife&s;ting a &s;en&s;ation; and, if I am not very much mi&s;taken in it indeed, the lively intere&s;t he feels in the occurrences of his father's life, is the re&s;ult, not of idle curio&s;ity, but unbounded filial affection. Such an amiable motive &s;hall not be di&s;|appointed in its end; and while I di&s;charge the duty of a parent in gratifying it, I &s;hall be encouraged and &s;u&s;tained under my labours by the &s;anguine ex|pectation, that he will derive from my exertions the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages in his future progre&s;s through life. As tho&s;e advantages are expected al&s;o to extend to my dear boy JOHN, who&s;e tender years di&s;qualify him from making the &s;ame immediate reflections on the various &s;ubjects as they occur, my FREDERICK will perceive that it becomes his duty, not only as a good &s;on, but as an affectionate brother, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and enforce them upon his mind, to explain to him the difficulties, and furni&s;h him with his rea&s;onings and inferences on them, &s;o as that they may make, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, equal impre&s;&s;ions on the heart and under&s;tanding of both. <Q>"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum:"</Q> And though few have the felicity to be warned by other men's misfortunes or faults, becau&s;e they &s;el|dom make deep impre&s;&s;ions on their feelings, I am
<PB N="16" REF="033487_0015_0FF72215CB75C2F8">
convinced that my &s;ufferings and errors, as they will intere&s;t my FREDERICK'S heart, and gratify his curio&s;ity, cannot fail to enlarge his under&s;tand|ing, and improve his conduct.</P>

<P>HAVING, in compliance with your reiterated &s;olicitations, determined to give you a narrative of my journey to the Ea&s;t Indies, and the &s;ingular turns of fortune which befel me there, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, on reflection, to prepare you &s;till further for the reception of it, by propo&s;ing certain terms to be fulfilled on your part; and as, in my la&s;t, I told you that I expected you, and, with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, your brother, to turn my r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion to a more u&s;eful account than the gratification of mere idle curio&s;ity, by letting the moral deducible from my errors and misfortunes &s;trike deep and take root in your mind&mdash;&s;o there are other things, which, though not &s;o extremely important, are too weighty to be neglected; to which I de&s;ire to direct your attention.</P>
<P>I believe you mu&s;t have already perceived, that the well-being of your&s;elf and your brother is my ne&s;t&mdash;I might, perhaps, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing much upon truth, &s;ay, my only object in life; that, to the care of your education, and the cultivation of your m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, I exclu&s;ively devote my time and my thoughts; and that, to in&s;ure your future happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="17" REF="033487_0016_0FF722184CC54980">
I would &s;acrifice every thing I have a right to di&s;po&s;e of, and ri&s;k even life it&s;elf. The time, I tru&s;t, is not far di&s;tant, when your brother will be as well qualified to under&s;tand this as you are now&mdash;when both will feel alike the important duty it enforces on you&mdash;and when your only emulation will be, who &s;hall produce the mo&s;t luxuriant har|ve&s;t to reward the labours I have taken&mdash;to reward your&s;elves.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, on my part, to give every thing I do a tendency to the great object of my wi&s;hes, and induce you, on your's, to contribute your &s;hare to it, I &s;hall give you, as I proceed in my narrative, a topographical de&s;cription of the various Countries through which I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to conduct you, and, as conci&s;ely as may be, an account of their manners, policy, and munici|pal in&s;titutions, &s;o far as I have been able to collect them; which I hope will &s;erve to awaken in you a thir&s;t for tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible parts of polite educa|tion, Geography and Hi&s;tory. I expect that you will carefully attend to tho&s;e &s;ciences, and that you will not &s;uffer your&s;elf, as you read my Letters, to be carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay by the rapid &s;tream of idle curio&s;ity from incident to incident, without time or di&s;po&s;i|tion for reflection: you mu&s;t take excur&s;ions, as you go along, from my Letters to your Geographical Grammar and your Maps&mdash;and, when nece&s;&s;ary, call in the aid of your Tutor, in order to compare my ob&s;ervations with tho&s;e of others on the &s;ame places, and by tho&s;e means to acquire as determinate an idea as po&s;&s;ible of their local &s;ituation, laws, and comparative advantages, whether of Nature or Art. You will thus enable your&s;elf hereafter to con&s;ider how &s;ociety is influenced, and why &s;ome commu|nities are better directed than others.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that as geography is a &s;cience to which rational conver&s;ation, as &s;up|ported

by gentlemen of breeding and education, mo&s;t frequently refers, the lea&s;t ignorance of it is continually liable to detection, and, when detected, &s;ubjects a man to the mo&s;t mortifying ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>The ingenious GEORGE ALEXANDER STEE|VENS has, in his celebrated Lecture upon Heads, given a mo&s;t ludicrous in&s;tance of this &s;pecies of ignorance, in the character of a citizen, who, cen|&s;uring the incapacity of mini&s;ters, propo&s;es to carry on the war on a new plan of his own. The plan is, to put the troops in cork jackets&mdash;&s;end them, thus equipped, to &s;ea&mdash;and <HI>land them in the Medi|terranean;</HI> When his companion a&s;ks him where that place lies, he calls him <HI>fool,</HI> and informs him that the Mediterranean is the capital of Con&s;tanti|nople. Thus, my dear &s;on, has this &s;atiri&s;t ridicu|led ignorance in pretenders to education; and thus will every one be ridiculous who betrays a deficien|cy in this very indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient in forming the character of a gentleman. But a &s;tory which I heard from a per&s;on of &s;trict veracity, will &s;erve more &s;trongly to &s;hew you the &s;hame attendant on ignorance of tho&s;e things which, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rank, we are &s;uppo&s;ed to know; and as the fear of &s;hame never fails to operate powerfully on a generous mind, I am &s;ure it will &s;erve to alarm you into indu&s;try, and application to your &s;tudies.</P>
<P>During the late American war, about that period when the KING of FRANCE was, &s;o fatally for him&s;elf, though perhaps in the end it may prove fortunate for the intere&s;ts of mankind, manife&s;ting an intention to interfere and join the Americans, a worthy alderman in Dublin, reading the new&s;pa|per, ob&s;erved a paragraph, intimating, that in con|&s;equence of Briti&s;h crui&s;ers having &s;topped &s;ome French ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, and &s;earched them, France had taken <HI>umbrage!</HI> The &s;agacious alderman, more

To this the other, after a torrent of invective again&s;t mini|&s;ters, and condolence with his affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted friend, an|&s;wered that he was utterly unable to tell him, but that he had often heard it mentioned, and of cour&s;e conceived it to a place of great importance; at the &s;ame time propo&s;ing that they &s;hould go to a neigh|bouring book&s;eller, who, as he dealt in books, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily know every thing, in order to have this gordian knot untied. They accordingly went; and having propounded the que&s;tion, "what part of the globe <HI>Umbrage</HI> lay in?" the book&s;eller took a Gazetteer, and, having &s;earched it diligently, de|clared that he could not find it, and &s;aid he was almo&s;t &s;ure there was no &s;uch place in exi&s;tence. To this the two aldermen, with a contemptuous &s;neer, an&s;wered by triumphantly reading the para|graph out of the new&s;paper. The book&s;eller, who was a &s;hrewd fellow, and, like mo&s;t of his coun|trymen, delighted in a je&s;t, gravely replied, that the Gazetteer being an old edition, he could not an&s;wer for it, but that he &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Umbrage</HI> lay &s;omewhere on the coa&s;t of America. With this the wi&s;e mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;trates returned home, partly &s;atisfied: but what words can expre&s;s their chagrin when they found their error&mdash;that the unlucky book&s;el|ler had &s;pread the &s;tory over the city&mdash;that the new&s;papers were filled with &s;atirical &s;quibs upon it&mdash;nay, that a caracature print of them&s;elves lead|ing the city-watch to the <HI>retaking of Umbrage,</HI> was &s;tuck up in every &s;hop&mdash;and finally, that they could &s;carcely (albeit aldermen) walk the &s;treets, without

having the populace &s;neer at them about the <HI>taking of Umbrage!</HI></P>
<P>Thus, my child, will every one be more or le&s;s ridiculous who appears obviou&s;ly ignorant of tho&s;e things which, from the rank he holds in life, he &s;hould be expected to know, or to the knowledge of which vanity or petulence may tempt him to pretend.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I need not &s;ay more to you on this &s;ubject; for I think you love me too well to di&s;ap|point me in the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, and I believe you have too much manly pride to &s;uffer &s;o degra|ding a defect as indolence to expo&s;e you hereafter to animadver&s;ion or contempt. Remember, that as nothing in this life, however trivial or worthle&s;s, is to be procured without labour&mdash;&s;o, above all others, the weighty and invaluable trea&s;ures of eru|dition are only to be acquired by exertions vigor|ou&s;ly made and unremittingly continued.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>A VARIETY of unpropicious circum|&s;tances gave ri&s;e to my journey to the Ea&s;t Indies, while dome&s;tic calamity marked my departure, and, at the very out&s;et, gave me a foreta&s;te of tho&s;e mi&s;e|ries which fate had re&s;erved to let fall upon me in the &s;equel. The channels from which I drew the means of &s;upporting my family in that &s;tyle which their rank and connections obliged them to maintain, were clogged by a coincidence of events as unlucky as unexpected: the war in India had interrupted the regular remittance of my property from thence: a &s;evere &s;hock which unbounded genero&s;ity and beneficence had given to the affairs of my father, rendered him incapable of maintaining his u&s;ual punctuality in the payment of the income he had a&s;&s;igned me; and, to crown the whole, I had been deprived, by death, of two lovely children (your brother and &s;i&s;ter), whom I loved not le&s;s than I have &s;ince loved you and your brother.</P>
<P>It was under the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e accumulated affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions, aggravated by the goading thought of leaving my family for &s;uch a length of time as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily elap&s;e before I could again &s;ee them, that I &s;et out for India in the month of May, in the year 1781, with a heart overwhelmed with woe, and too &s;urely predictive of misfortunes.</P>
<P>From the gloomy cave of depre&s;&s;ion in which my mind was &s;unk, I looked forward, to &s;eek, in the future, a gleam of comfort&mdash;but in vain: not a ray
<PB N="22" REF="033487_0021_0FF72227346ABB50">
appeared&mdash;Melancholy had thrown her &s;ombre &s;ha|dow on the whole. Even pre&s;ent affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction yielded up a &s;hare of my heart to an unaccountable di&s;mal pre&s;entiment of future ill; and the di&s;a&s;ters and di&s;appointments I had pa&s;&s;ed, were lo&s;t and forgot|ten in ominous forebodings and in&s;tinctive pre&s;ages of tho&s;e that were to come.</P>
<P>Of all the weakne&s;&s;es to which the human mind is &s;ubject, &s;uper&s;tition is that again&s;t which I would have you guard with the utmo&s;t vigilance. It is the mo&s;t incurable canker of the mind. Under its un|relenting dominion, happine&s;s withers, the under|&s;tanding becomes ob&s;cured, and every principle of joy is bla&s;ted. For this rea&s;on I wi&s;h to account for tho&s;e pre&s;ages, by referring them to their true phy&s;ical cau&s;es, in order thereby to prevent your young mind from receiving, from what I have written, any injurious impre&s;&s;ion, or &s;uper&s;titious idea of <HI>pre&s;entiment,</HI> as it is fa&s;hionably denominated.</P>
<P>If the mind of man be examined, it will be found naturally prone to the contemplation of the future&mdash; its flights from hope to hope, or fear to fear, lead|ing it in&s;en&s;ibly from objects pre&s;ent and in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, to tho&s;e remote and in expectation&mdash;from po&s;itive good to &s;uppo&s;itious better, or from actual melancholy to imaginary misfortune. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the mind never fails to &s;ee the pro&s;pect in colours derived from the medium through which it is viewed and exaggerated by the magnifying power of fancy. Thus my mind, labouring under all the unea&s;ine&s;s I have de&s;cribed, &s;aw every thing through the gloomy medium of melancholy, and, looking forward, foreboded nothing but misfortune: acci|dent afterwards fulfilled tho&s;e forebodings; but accident, nay, the mo&s;t trifling change of circum|&s;tances, might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;o totally changed the face of my &s;ub&s;equent progre&s;s, that good fortune, in&s;tead of mi&s;adventure, might have been my lot,
<PB N="23" REF="033487_0022_0FF72228CD7FE6F0">
and &s;o all my forebodings been as illu&s;ory and falli|ble as all &s;uch phantoms of the imagination really are. Thus I argue now&mdash;and I am &s;ure I argue truly; but if rea&s;on be not timely called in, and made, as it were, an habitual inmate, it avails but little again&s;t the overbearing force of &s;uper&s;tition, who, when &s;he once gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, holds her &s;eat with unrelenting tenacity, and, call|ing in a whole ho&s;t of horrors, with de&s;pair at their head, to her aid, entrenches her&s;elf behind their formidable powers, and bids defiance to the a&s;&s;aults of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus it fared with me&mdash;Under the dominion of a gloomy pre&s;entiment, I left London; and my journey down to Margate, where I was to take &s;hipping, was, as SHAKSPEARE emphatically &s;ays, <Q>a phanta&s;m, or a hideous dream&mdash;and my little &s;tate of man &s;uffered, as it were, the nature of an in&s;urrection:</Q>&mdash;the chaos within me forbade even the approach of di&s;criminate reflection; and I found my&s;elf on board the packet, bound to O&s;|tend, without having a &s;ingle trace left upon my mind, of the intermediate &s;tages and incidents that happened &s;ince I had left London.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved&mdash;and I wi&s;h you always to carry it in memory, as one of the be&s;t con&s;olations under affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction&mdash;that human &s;ufferings, like all other things, find their vital principle exhau&s;ted, and then extiction accelerated, by overgrowth; and that, at the moment when man thinks him&s;elf mo&s;t mi&s;erable, a benignant Providence is preparing re|lief, in &s;ome form or other, for him. So if, in &s;ome &s;ort, happened with me; for I was fortunate enough to find in the packet a fellow-pa&s;&s;enger, who&s;e valuable conver&s;ation and agreeable manners beguiled me in&s;en&s;ibly of the gloomy contemplation in which I was ab&s;orbed, and afforded my tortured mind a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of pain. This gen|tleman
<PB N="24" REF="033487_0023_0FF7222A9F639D30">
was General LOCKHART: he was going to Bru&s;&s;els, to pay his court to the Emperor JOSEPH the Second, who was then &s;hortly expected in the Low Countries, in order to go through the cere|monies of his inauguration. As Bru&s;&s;els lay in my way, I was flattered with the hopes of having for a companion a gentleman at once &s;o plea&s;ing in his manners and re&s;pect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble in his character, and was much comforted when I found him as much di&s;po|&s;ed as my&s;elf to an agreement to travel the whole of the way thither together. Thus, though far, very far from a &s;tate of ea&s;e, I was, when landing at O&s;tend, at lea&s;t le&s;s mi&s;erable than at my coming on board the packet.</P>
<P>As this letter is already &s;pun to a length too great to admit of any material part of the de&s;cription I am now to give you of O&s;tend, and the country to which it belongs, I think it better to po&s;tpone it to my next, which I mean to devote entirely to that &s;ubject, and thereby avoid the confu&s;ion that ari&s;es from mixing two &s;ubjects in the &s;ame letter, or breaking off the thread of one in order to make way for the other.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear boy!&mdash;Forget not your brother JOHN. That you may both be good and happy, is all the wi&s;h now left to, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THAT country to which I am now to call your attention&mdash;I mean, the Netherlands&mdash;is marked by a greater number of political changes, and hara&s;&s;ed by a more continued train of military
<PB N="25" REF="033487_0024_0FF7222D23C5B318">
operations, than perhaps any country in the records of modern hi&s;tory. It may truly be called the Cockpit Royal of Europe, on which tyrants, as ambition, avarice, pride, caprice, or malignity, prompted them, pitted thou&s;ands, and hundreds of thou&s;ands, of their fellow-creatures, to cut each other's throats about &s;ome point, frivolous as regard|ing them&s;elves, unimportant to mankind, and only tending to gratify a diabolical lu&s;t for dominion; Yet, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, (&s;uch are the natural qualities of this country), it has, till lately, been in a tolerably flouri&s;hing &s;tate; and would, under a good government and proper protection, equal any part of Europe for richne&s;s.</P>
<P>Flanders, Brabant, and the country now called the United Netherlands, were in general known by the name of Netherlands, Low Countries, or Pais-bas, from their &s;ituat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, in re&s;pect of Germany. Anciently, they formed a part of Belgic Gaul, of which you may remember to have read an account in the Commentaries of JULIUS CAESAR, who de&s;cribes the inhabitants as the mo&s;t valiant of all the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llic Nations&mdash;<Q>Horum omnium Belgae funt forti&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi.</Q> They after|wards were &s;ubject to petty princes, and made part of the German Empire; and, in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, became &s;ubject to CHARLES the Fifth of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: but, being oppre&s;&s;ed beyond endurance by his &s;on, PHILIP the Second of Spain, (that blind and furious bigot), they openly revolted &mdash;&s;lew to arms to a&s;&s;ert their freedom; and, after a &s;truggle as glorious in effect as virtuous in princi|ple&mdash;after performing prodigies of valour, and ex|hibiting examples of fortitude, to which none but men fighting in the godlike cau&s;e of LIBERTY are competent&mdash;led on by the wi&s;dom and valour of the PRINCE of ORANGE, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the SOVE|REIGN of GREAT BRITAIN&mdash;they at length &s;o

far &s;ucceeded, that tho&s;e now called the United Netherlands, entered into a &s;olemn league, and forced the gloomy tyrant to acknowledge their in|dependence. But that part to which I am now particularly to allude, continued annexed to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In 1787, they revolted, and made a temporary &s;truggle to di&s;engage them&s;elves from the dominion of the EMPEROR; but, owing to &s;ome cabals among them&s;elves, and the temper|ate conduct of that prince, they again returned to their allegiance, and were rewarded with a general amne&s;ty. In 1792, they were over-run by the French army under General DUMOURIER&mdash;open|ed their arms to tho&s;e republicans, and were re|warded for it by oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, and inju&s;tice. The French, however, were driven back out of the country; and, wonderful to relate, they again re|ceived their old ma&s;ter, the EMPEROR, with &s;trong demon&s;trations of joy, and manife&s;ted their loyalty and attachment to him by every expre&s;&s;ion that abject hypocri&s;y could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<Q>"O! how unlike their Belgic &s;ires of old!"</Q>
<P>Here, could I &s;top with &s;trict ju&s;tice, I would&mdash; But, behold! the French again came; again they opened their gates to receive them; and again they were, with tenfold fury and rapacity, pillaged, op|pre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted; and at the very time I am writing this, the guillotine is doing its office&mdash;en|forcing the payment of the mo&s;t exorbitant and enormous contributions, and compelling, it is &s;aid, one hundred thou&s;and of the ill-fated inhabitants to take the field, as &s;oldiers of the republic.</P>
<P>Human opinion is &s;o chequered and uncertain, that two very hone&s;t men may in certain ca&s;es act in direct contradiction and ho&s;tility to each other, with the very be&s;t intentions&mdash;He, therefore, mu&s;t have but a cold heart, and a contracted under&s;tand|ing,

who cannot forgive the man that acts in &s;uch ca&s;es erroneou&s;ly, when he acts from the exact dic|tates of his opinion, and upon the principle which he has con&s;cientiou&s;ly adopted: but when a whole people are &s;een whi&s;king about with every gu&s;t of fortune, and making a new principle for every new point of convenience, we mu&s;t di&s;pi&s;e them even when they happen to act right, and can &s;carcely af|ford them &s;o much as pity in their calamities. The Au&s;ttrian Netherlands are now in that &s;tate; and, without pre&s;uming to &s;ay in which of their tergiver|&s;ations they were right, I will venture to pronounce that they de&s;erve puni&s;hment, and I believe they are in hands very likely to give them their due.</P>
<P>To return&mdash;O&s;tend is a &s;ea-port of Au&s;trian Flanders, and is &s;ituated in the Liberty of Bruges. It was, at one time, the &s;tronge&s;t town in Flan|ders: but a double ditch and ramparts, which con|&s;tituted its &s;trength, are now de&s;troyed; and in the place where the former &s;tood, docks, or rather ba&s;ons, extremely capacious and commodious, are formed, for the reception of &s;hipping. The ground about the town is very low and mar&s;hy, and cut into a number of fine canals&mdash;into &s;ome of which, &s;hips of the large&s;t &s;ize may enter&mdash;and in one of which, ve&s;&s;els of great burthen may ride, even clo&s;e to Bruges. The harbour here is &s;o fortunately cir|cum&s;tanced, that it was once thought, by engineers, entirely &s;ecure from a blockade; and its pri&s;tine &s;trength can in no way be &s;o well de&s;cribed, as by a relation of the defence it made in the four fir&s;t years of the &s;eventeenth century&mdash;though, near the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth, it was no better than an in|&s;ignificant fi&s;hing town. It held out again&s;t the Spaniards for three years, two months, and &s;ixteen days. Eighty thou&s;and men lo&s;t their lives before it, while fifty thou&s;and were killed or died within. It at la&s;t &s;urrendered, but on good terms; and not

for want of men or provi&s;ions, but for want of ground to &s;tand on, which the enemy took from them, at an amazing lo&s;s, &s;tep by &s;tep, till they had not room left for men to defend it. Three hun|dred thou&s;and cannon-balls, of thirty pounds weight each, were fired again&s;t it; and the be&s;ieged often filled up the breaches made in their ramparts with heaps of dead bodies.</P>

<P>THE pride of the Engli&s;h is remarked all over the globe, even to a proverb! But pride is a word of &s;uch dubious meaning, &s;o undefined in its &s;en&s;e, and &s;trained to &s;uch various imports, that you &s;hall hear it violently execrated by one, and warmly applauded by another&mdash;this denouncing it as a &s;in of the fir&s;t magnitude, and that main|taining it to be the mo&s;t vigilant guardian of human virtue. Tho&s;e differences in opinion ari&s;e not from any defect in the intellects of either, but from each viewing the &s;ubject in that one point in which it fir&s;t &s;trikes his eye, or be&s;t &s;uits his ta&s;te, his feel|ing, or his prejudices. I have no doubt, however, but a full con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject would &s;hew, that pride, as it is called, is only good or bad as the object from which it ari&s;es is mean or magnificent, culpable or meritorious. That noble pride which &s;timulates to extraordinary acts of genero&s;ity and magnanimity, &s;uch as, in many in&s;tances, has di&s;|tingui&s;hed, above all others, the nobility of Spain, exacts the homage and admiration of mankind: But I fear very much that our Engli&s;h pride is of another growth, and &s;mells too rankly of that over-&s;trained commercial &s;pirit which makes the ba&s;is of the pre&s;ent grandeur of Great Britain, but which, in my humble judgment, rai&s;es only to deba&s;e her

In &s;hort, we are approaching, I fear, with daily accelerated &s;teps, to the di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ordid habits of the Dutch, of whom Doctor GOLDSMITH &s;o very pertinently and truly &s;peaks, when he &s;ays, <Q>"Ev'n Liberty it&s;elf is barter'd here!"</Q></P>
<P>Without leading your mind through a maze of di&s;qui&s;ition on this &s;ubject, which might fatigue with ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s and prolixity, I will bring you back to the point from which the matter &s;tarted, and content my&s;elf with remarking, that the pride of the Engli&s;h, &s;peaking of it as a part of the nati|onal character, is the meane&s;t of all pride. The inflation of bloated, overgrown wealth, an over-weening affection for money, an idolatrous wor&s;hip of gain, have ab&s;olutely confounded the general intellect, and warped the judgment of the many to that exce&s;s, that, in e&s;timating men or things, they always refer to "what is he worth?" or, "what will it fetch?" This &s;ordid habit of thinking was finely hit off by a keen fellow, the native of a neighbouring kingdom, who, for many years, car|ried on bu&s;ine&s;s in London, and failed:&mdash;Sitting one day in a coffee-hou&s;e in the city, where &s;ome wealthy citizens were di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a &s;ubject not entire|ly unconnected with ca&s;h concerns, one of them ob&s;erving him rather attentive to their conver&s;ation, turned to him, and &s;aid, "What is your opinion, Sir, of the matter?"&mdash;"'s blood, Sir!" returned he, peevi&s;hly, "what opinion can a man have in this country, who has not a guinea in his pocket?"</P>

In all the places through which I have travelled, I have had occa&s;ion to remark (and the remark has been amply verified by every gentleman I have ever conver&s;ed with on the &s;ub|ject), and the mo&s;t extravagant hou&s;es of entertain|ment are tho&s;e kept by Engli&s;hmen.

<P>I had heard much of Bruges, its grandeur, and its opulence; you will gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e then, when, on entering it, I found nothing but an old-fa&s;hioned, ill-built, irregular town; the &s;treets, in general, narrow and dirty, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of poverty and &s;qualid wretch|edne&s;s:

<P>Perhaps there is no &s;ubject that affords an ampler field for a &s;peculative mind to expatiate upon, than the various, and, I may &s;ay, incongruous revolu|tions which have chequered the progre&s;s of human &s;ociety from the fir&s;t records of hi&s;tory down to the pre&s;ent time. It is indeed a &s;peculation which not only tends to improve the under&s;tanding, by calling in experience to correct the illu&s;ions of theory, but is highly in&s;tructive in a moral point of view, by pointing out the in&s;tability of the very be&s;t &s;trictures of human wi&s;dom, and teaching us how little reliance is to be placed upon human ca&s;ualties, or earthly contingencies. Look to Greece, once the fountain-head of arts, eloquence, and lear|ning, and the mother of freedom&mdash;her poets, her legi&s;lators, her &s;oldiers, and her patriots, even to this day con&s;idered the brighte&s;t examples of earth|ly glory!&mdash;&s;ee her now &s;unk in &s;lavery, ignorance, &s;loth, and imbecility, below any petty nation of Europe.

<P>It was in this irre&s;i&s;tible mutation of things, that Bruges &s;unk from the high &s;tate of a mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing city, where there are &s;till (unle&s;s the French have de&s;troyed them) to be &s;een the remains of &s;e|venteen palaces, anciently the re&s;idences of con&s;uls of different nations, each of which had di&s;tinct hou&s;es, magnificently built and furni&s;hed, with warehou&s;es for their merchandi&s;es: and &s;uch was the power and wealth of the citizens in tho&s;e days, that it is an indubitable fact, they kept their &s;ove|reign, the Archduke MAXIMILIAN, pri&s;oner, af|fronted his &s;ervants, and abu&s;ed his officers; nor would they relea&s;e him until he took an oath to pre&s;erve inviolate the laws of the &s;tate.

<P>Several fine canals run in a variety of directions from Bruges: by one of them, boats can go, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ummer's day, to O&s;tend, Neuport, Furnes, and Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ki&s;k; and ve&s;&s;els of four hundred tuns can float in the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of this town.

two rivers Lys and Scheldt, as in London; for which, as there, every hou&s;e pays a certain tax.</P>
<P>Although the trade of this city has, like that of all the Low Countries, been gradually declining, and daily &s;ucked into the vortices of Briti&s;h and Dutch commerce, there were, till the French en|tered it, many rich merchants there, who met every day at noon in the great market-place, to communi|cate and tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s, which was chiefly done in the Flemi&s;h language, hardly any one in it &s;peak|ing French; a circum&s;tance that by this time, is much altered&mdash;for they have been already made, if not to &s;peak French, at lea&s;t to &s;ing <HI>Ca-ira,</HI> and dance to the tune of it too, to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The once-famed grandeur of this city con&s;i&s;ted chiefly, like that of all grand places in the dark periods of Popery, of the gloomy piles, the o&s;ten|tatious frippery, and unwieldy ma&s;&s;es of wealth, accumulated by a long &s;eries of monki&s;h impo&s;ture &mdash;of Gothic &s;tructures, of enormous &s;ize and &s;able a&s;pect, filled with dreary cells, calculated to &s;trike the &s;ouls of the ignorant and enthu&s;ia&s;tic with holy horror, to in&s;pire awe of the places, and venera|tion for the per&s;ons who dared to inhabit them, and, by enfeebling the rea&s;on with the mixed ope|rations of horror, wonder, and reverence, to fit the credulous for the reception of every impo&s;i|tion, however gro&s;s in conception, or bungled in execution. Tho&s;e are the things which con&s;tituted the greatne&s;s and &s;plendor of the cities of ancient Chri&s;tendom; to tho&s;e has the &s;turdie&s;t human vigour and intellect been forced to bend the knees: they were built to endure the outrages of time; and will &s;tand, I am &s;ure, long, long after their power &s;hall have been annihilated.</P>
<P>What a powerful engine has &s;uper&s;tition been, in the cunning management of prie&s;ts! How lamenta|ble it is to think, that not only all who believed,

The mitre of this place conveys to the head that wears it a dioce&s;e containing &s;ix cities, from the names of which you will be able to form &s;ome &s;mall judgment of the opulence of one poor &s;on of ab&s;tinence and mortification.&mdash;Tho&s;e cities are, in the fir&s;t place, Bruges it&s;elf, then O&s;tend, Sluys, Damme, Middleburgh in Flanders, and Oudenberch&mdash;not to mention one hundred and thirty-three boroughs and villages; and if you could compute the number of inferior clergy with which the &s;treets and highways are filled, you would be thunder&s;truck. There, and in all tho&s;e Popi&s;h countries, they may be &s;een, with grote&s;que habits and bald pates, buzzing up and down like bees, in &s;warms, (a precious hive!)&mdash;and, with the mo&s;t vehement prote&s;tations of voluntary po|verty in their mouths, and eyes uplifted to Hea|ven, &s;crambling for the good things of the earth with the eagerne&s;s of a pack of hounds, and the rapacity of a whole roll of lawyers! With loaded thighs (I might &s;ay, loaded arms too, for they have large pockets even in their &s;leeves, for the conceal|ment of moveables), they return to the great hive, where, contrary to the law of bees, the drone lives in idle &s;tate, and he plunders them: contrary, too, to the habits of tho&s;e u&s;eful in&s;ects, they bani&s;h the queen bee, and &s;uffer no female to approach their cells, but keep them in contiguous hives, where, under cover of the night, they vi&s;it them, and ful|fil in private that which they deny in public&mdash;the great command of Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033487_0040_0FF7225D10E1AF90">The fir&s;t building in nominal rank, though by no means the fir&s;t in value, is the great cathedral, which has at lea&s;t bulk, antiquity, and gloomine&s;s enough to recommend it to the faithful. It is by no means unfurni&s;hed within, though not in &s;o re|markable a manner as to induce me to fill a letter with it. In a word, it is an old Popi&s;h cathedral, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed wanting in wealth: at the time I write, it has been &s;tanding no le&s;s a time than nine hundred and twenty-nine years, having been built in the year 865.</P>
<P>The next that occurs to me, as worthy of notice, is the church of Notre Dame, or that dedicated to <HI>our Lady</HI> the Virgin MARY. This is really a beau|tiful &s;tructure of the kind&mdash;indeed magnificent. Its &s;teeple is beyond conception &s;tupendous, being &s;o very high as to be &s;een at &s;ea off O&s;tend, al|though it is not elevated in the &s;malle&s;t degree by any ri&s;e in the ground; for, &s;o very flat is the whole intermediate country, that I believe it would puzzle a &s;kilful leveller to find two feet elevation from high-water-mark at O&s;tend up to this city. The contents of this church are corre&s;pondent to its external appearance&mdash;being enriched and beau|tified with a va&s;t variety of &s;acerdotal trinkets, and fine tombs and monuments. As to the former, the ve&s;tments of that &s;ame THOMAS A BECKET whom I mentioned in my la&s;t, make a part of the curio&s;i|ties depo&s;ited in this church: this furious and in|flexible impo&s;tor was archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; and his &s;truggles to en&s;lave both the king and peo|ple of England, and make them tributary to the Pope, have canonized him, and obtained the very honourable depot I mention for his ve&s;tments. To do ju&s;tice, however, to the &s;pirit and &s;agacity of the holy fathers who have &s;o long taken the pains to pre&s;erve them, it mu&s;t be commemorated, that they are, or at lea&s;t were &s;et with diamonds, and
<PB N="42" REF="033487_0041_0FF7225EA1AE1200">
other precious &s;tones! Probably, among the many prie&s;ts who have, in &s;o many centuries, had the cu&s;tody of tho&s;e divine relics, &s;ome one, more &s;a|gacious than the re&s;t, might conceive, that, to lie in a church, and be &s;een by the all-believing eyes of the faithful, a little coloured gla&s;s was ju&s;t as good as any precious &s;tone, and wi&s;ely have con|verted the originals to &s;ome better purpo&s;e. If &s;o, it will be &s;ome con&s;olation to Holy Mother Church to reflect, that &s;he has bilked the <HI>Sans-culottes,</HI> who certainly have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saint THOMAS A BECKET'S &s;acerdotal petticoats; and, if they have been &s;ound enough to &s;tand the cutting, have, by this time, converted them into comfortable cam|paigning breeches. O mon&s;trous! wicked! abo|minable!&mdash;that the Royal MARY, &s;i&s;ter to the great Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, &s;hould, &s;o long ago as the Reformation, have bought at an immen&s;e price, and depo&s;ited in the trea&s;ury of the church of <HI>our Lady</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin MARY, the ve&s;t|ments of a &s;aint, only to make breeches, in the year 1794, for a French &s;oldier! The time has been, when the bare &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;uch &s;acrilege would have turned the brain of half the people of Chri&s;tendom: but tho&s;e things are now better managed.</P>
<P>Of the tombs in this church, I &s;hall only mention two, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by their co&s;tli|ne&s;s, magnificence, and antiquity. They are made of copper, well gilt. One of them is the tomb of MARY, heire&s;s to the Ducal Hou&s;e of Burgundy; and the other, that of CHARLES (commonly called <HI>the Hardy</HI>), Duke of Burgundy, her father.</P>
<P>In Bruges there were four great abbeys, and an amazing number of convents and nunneries. The buildings, I pre&s;ume, yet &s;tand; but there is little doubt that their contents, of every kind, have been,
<PB N="43" REF="033487_0042_0FF722607A5768D8">

<P>The church once belonging to the Je&s;uits, is built in a noble &s;tyle of architecture: and that of the Do|minicans has not only its external merits, but its internal value; for, be&s;ides the u&s;ual &s;uperabun|dance of rich chalices, &amp;c. it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome very great curio&s;ities&mdash;</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, a very curious, highly wrought pulpit &mdash;beautiful in it&s;elf, but remarkable for the top be|ing &s;upported by wood, cut out, in the mo&s;t natu|ral, deceptive manner, in the form of ropes, and which beguile the &s;pectator the more into a belief of its reality, becau&s;e it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of ropes.</P>
<P>Secondly, a picture&mdash;and &s;o extraordinary a pic|ture! Before I de&s;cribe it, I mu&s;t appri&s;e you that your faith mu&s;t be almo&s;t as great as that of a Spa|ni&s;h Chri&s;tian to believe me&mdash;to believe that the human intellect ever &s;unk &s;o low as, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, to conceive, and, in the next, to harbour and admire, &s;uch a piece. But I mi&s;take&mdash;it has i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s merit; it is a curio&s;ity&mdash;the demon of &s;atire him&s;elf could not wi&s;h for a greater.</P>
<P>This picture, then, is the repre&s;entation of a mar|riage!&mdash;but of whom? why, truly, of JESUS CHRIST with Saint CATHARINE of Sienna. Ob|&s;erve the congruity&mdash;Saint CATHARINE of Sienna lived many centuries after the tran&s;lation of JESUS CHRIST to Heaven, where he is to &s;it, you know, till he comes to judge the quick and the dead!&mdash; But who marries them? In truth, Saint DOMINIC, the patron of this church! The Virgin MARY joins their hands&mdash;that is not ami&s;s&mdash;But, to crown the whole, King DAVID him&s;elf, who died &s;o long before CHRIST was born, plays the harp at the wedding!</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="033487_0043_0FF7226307E78F40">My dear FREDERICK, I &s;hall take it as no &s;mall in&s;tance of your dutiful opinion of me to believe, that &s;uch a picture exi&s;ted, and made part of the holy paraphernalia of a temple con&s;ecrated to the wor&s;hip of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vinity: but I a&s;&s;ure you it is a fact; and as I have never given you rea&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect my veracity.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was going to the barque, at Bruges, to take my departure for Ghent, the next town in my route, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a number of offi|cious, bu&s;y, poor fellows, crowding round my effects, and &s;eizing them&mdash;&s;ome my trunk, &s;ome my portmanteau. &amp;c. I believe two or three to each: but my a&s;toni&s;hment partly &s;ub&s;ided when I was told that they were porters, who plied on the canal, and about the city, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and only came to have the <HI>honour</HI> of carraying my baggage down to the ve&s;&s;el. Noting their eagerne&s;s, I could not help &s;miling. I know there are tho&s;e, and I have heard of &s;uch, who would blu&s;ter at them: but my mirth at the bu&s;tling importance which the poor fellows affected, &s;oon &s;unk into &s;erious con|cern; I &s;aid within my&s;elf, "Alas, how hard mu&s;t be your lot indeed!" and my imagination was in an in&s;tant back again in London, where a porter often makes you pay for a job, not in money only, but in patience al&s;o, and where the &s;urline&s;s of in|dependence &s;cowls upon his brow as he does your
<PB N="46" REF="033487_0045_0FF7226AC64EEDE0">
work. Every one of my men demanded a remu|neration for his labour: one man could have ea&s;ily done the work of five&mdash;but I re&s;olved not to &s;end them away di&s;contented: he is but a &s;ordid churl that would; and I paid them to their full &s;atisfac|tion. Here, my dear FREDERICK, let me offer you (&s;ince it occurs) my parental advice on this point&mdash;from the practice of which you will gain more &s;olid felicity than you can po&s;sibly be aware of now: never weigh &s;crupulou&s;ly the value of the work of the poor; rather exceed than fall &s;hort of rewarding it: it is a very, very &s;mall thing, that will put them in good humour with you and with them&s;elves, and relax the hard furrows of labour into the &s;oft &s;mile of gratitude&mdash;a &s;mile which, to a heart of &s;en&s;ibility &s;uch as yours, will, of it&s;elf, ten-thou&s;and-fold repay you, even though the fre|quent practice of it &s;hould abridge you of a few of tho&s;e things called plea&s;ures, or detract a little from the weight of your pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Being again &s;eated in my barque, I &s;et off for Ghent, a city lying at a di&s;tance of twenty-four miles from Bruges. I mu&s;t here remark to you, that the company one meets in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els is not always of the fir&s;t rank; it is generally of a mixed, motley kind: but to a man who carries along with him, through his travels, a love for his fellow-crea|tures, and a de&s;ire to &s;ee men, and their cu&s;toms and manners, it is both plea&s;ant and eligible&mdash;at lea&s;t I thought it &s;o, and enjoyed it. There were tho&s;e among&s;t us who &s;poke rather loftily on that &s;ubject: I &s;aid nothing; but it brought to my mind a reflection I have often had occa&s;ion to concur in, viz. that a fa&s;tidious u&s;urpation of dignity (happily denominated <HI>&s;tateline&s;s</HI>) is the never-failing mark of an up&s;tart or a blockhead. The man of true digni|ty, &s;elf-erect and &s;trong, needs not have recour&s;e, for &s;upport, to the comparative wretchedne&s;s of his
<PB N="47" REF="033487_0046_0FF7226C5709BC50">
fellow-creature, or plume him&s;elf upon &s;purious &s;uperiority. You will under&s;tand me, however! When I &s;ay, "the man of true dignity," I am far, very far, from meaning a lord, a &s;quire, a banker, or a general officer&mdash;I mean a man of intrin&s;ic worth&mdash;homo emunctae naris&mdash;one who, in every &s;tation into which chance may throw him, feels firm in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of right&mdash;who can &s;ee and cheri&s;h merit, though enveloped and concealed be|hind a &s;habby &s;uit of clothes&mdash;and who &s;corns the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own-up fool of fortune, that without &s;en&s;e or &s;en|timent, without virtue, wi&s;dom, or courage, pre|&s;umes to call him&s;elf great, merely becau&s;e he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a few acres of earth which he had neither the indu&s;try nor merit to earn, or becau&s;e his great-great-great-grandfather purcha&s;ed a title by perfidy to his country, the plunder of his fellow-citizens, or the &s;laughter of mankind.</P>
<P>Although the face of that part of the country through which we are now pa&s;&s;ing, like that of the preceding &s;tage from O&s;tend to Bruges, wants di|ver&s;ity, it has its charms, and would be particularly delightful in the eye of an Engli&s;h farmer; for it is covered with the thicke&s;t verdure on each &s;ide of the canal, and the banks are decorated all along by rows of &s;tately trees, while the fields in the back ground are cultivated to the highe&s;t degree of perfection, and bear the a&s;pect of producing the mo&s;t abundant harve&s;t.</P>
<P>You will be able to form a judgment of the trif|ling expence of travelling in this country, from my expences in this &s;tage of twenty-four miles. I had an excellent dinner for about fifteen pence of our money; my pa&s;&s;age co&s;t me but &s;ixteen more, amounting in all to two &s;hillings and &s;even pence: compare that with travelling in England, where one cannot ri&s;e up from an indifferent dinner, in
<PB N="48" REF="033487_0047_0FF7226FD880BC50">
an inn, under five &s;hillings at the lea&s;t, and you mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at the di&s;proportion.</P>
<P>Ghent is the capital of Flanders, and is to be reckoned among the large&s;t cities of Europe, as it covers a &s;pace of ground of not le&s;s than &s;even miles in circumference; but there is not above one half of that occupied with buildings, the greater part being thrown into fields, gardens, orchards, and plea&s;ure-grounds. Situated on four navigable rivers, and inter&s;ected into no fewer than twenty-&s;ix i&s;lands by a number of canals, which afford an ea&s;y, cheap, and expeditious carriage for weighty merchandize, it may be con&s;idered, in point of local advantages for commerce, &s;uperior to mo&s;t cities in Europe; while tho&s;e i&s;lands are again united by about a hundred bridges, &s;ome great and &s;ome &s;mall, which contrbute much to the beauty of the city.</P>
<P>To a man accu&s;tomed to mould his thoughts by what he &s;ees in Great Britain, the &s;trong fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fica|tions that &s;urround almo&s;t all towns on the Conti|nent convey the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|minding him of the fir&s;t mi&s;ery of mankind, War! &mdash; denoting, alas! too truly, the di&s;po&s;ition of man to violate the rights of his fellow-creatures, and manife&s;ting the tyrannous abu&s;e of power. On me, though trained and accu&s;tomed to military ha|bits, this "dreadful note of preparation" had an unplea&s;ing effect; for, though born, bred, and ha|bituated to the life of a &s;oldier, I find the feelings of the citizen and the man claim a paramount right to my heart.</P>
<P>Ghent was once extremely well fortified, and calculated, by nature as well as by art, to repel en|croachment. It had a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, walls, and ditches; and now, though not otherwi&s;e &s;trong, the country may, by &s;hutting up the &s;lui|ces, be, for above a mile round, laid in a very
<PB N="49" REF="033487_0048_0FF722730623F1F8">
&s;hort time under water. It was formerly &s;o popu|lous and powerful, that it declared war more than once again&s;t its &s;overeign, and rai&s;ed amazing ar|mies. In the year 1587, it &s;uffered dreadfully from all the ravages of famine, under which a number not le&s;s than three thou&s;and of its inhabitants pe|ri&s;hed in one week.</P>
<P>This town is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the nativity of two celebrated characters: one was the famous JOHN of Gaunt, &s;on of King EDWARD the third of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gland; the other, the Emperor CHARLES the Fifth, who was born there in the year 1500.</P>
<P>It was in this city that the Confederation of the States, well known under the title of the Pacifica|tion of Ghent, which united the Provinces in the mo&s;t la&s;ting union of intere&s;t and laws, was held: this union was chiefly owing to the vigorous, un|remitted efforts of WILLIAM the Fir&s;t, Prince of Orange, to who&s;e valour and virtue may be attri|buted the independence of the United States.</P>
<P>In this city there were computed to be fifty com|panies of trade&s;men, among whom were manufac|tured a variety of very curious and rich cloths, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilks: it is certain, that the woollen manufac|ture flouri&s;hed here before it had made the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;s in England, who&s;e wool they then bought. There was al&s;o a good branch of linen manufacture here, and a pretty bri&s;k corn trade, for which it was locally well calculated. You will ob&s;erve, once for all, that in &s;peaking of this country, I generally u&s;e the pa&s;t ten&s;e; for, at pre&s;ent, they are utterly undone.</P>
<P>Ghent was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who, like the bi&s;hop of Bruges, was &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mechlin. Thus, in mo&s;t Chri&s;tian countries, are the intellects, the con&s;ciences, and the ca&s;h too, of the people, &s;hut up and hid from the light, by prie&s;t within dean, and dean within bi&s;hop&mdash;like
<PB N="50" REF="033487_0049_0FF7227592F60100">
a ring in the hand of a conjurer, box within box &mdash;till at la&s;t they are enveloped in the great recep|tacle of all deception, the capacious pocket of the archbi&s;hop. Let not &s;ceptered tyrants, their legi|ons, their &s;caffolds, and their &s;words, bear all the infamy of the &s;lavery of mankind! Opinion, opinion, under the management of fraud and im|po&s;ture, is the engine that forges their fetters!!&mdash; JANSENIUS, from whom the Jan&s;eni&s;ts took their name, was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of this place; and the late bi&s;hop, I think, may be reckoned the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The municipal government of this city is correct, and well calculated to &s;ecure internal peace and or|der. The chief magi&s;trate is the high bailiff; &s;ub|ordinate to whom are burgoma&s;ters, echivins, and coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Ghent is not deficient in &s;tately edifices; and, true to their &s;y&s;tem, the holy fathers of the church have their &s;hare, which, in old Popi&s;h countries, is at lea&s;t nineteen twentieths. In the middle of the town is a high tower, called Belfort tower: from whence there is a delightful pro&s;pect over the whole city and its environs. Mona&s;teries and churches, there, are without number; be&s;ides ho&s;|pitals and market-places: that called Friday's mar|ket, is the large&s;t of all, and is adorned with a &s;ta|tue of CHARLES the Fifth, in his imperial robes. The &s;tad-hou&s;e is a magnificent &s;tructure&mdash;So is the cathedral, under which the reverend fathers have built a &s;ubterraneous church. What deeds are tho&s;e which &s;hun the light! Why tho&s;e holy patriarchs have &s;uch a de&s;ire for burying them&s;elves, and working like moles under ground, they them&s;elves be&s;t know, and I think it is not difficult for others to conjecture.</P>
<P>This cathedral, however, is well worth atten|tion, on account of &s;ome capital pictures it contains. The marble of the church is remarkably fine, and
<PB N="51" REF="033487_0050_0FF7227833BF3528">
the altar-piece &s;plendid beyond all po&s;&s;ible de&s;crip|tion; and, indeed, in all the others, there are paintings, eminent for their own excellence, and for the celebrity of the ma&s;ters who painted them.</P>
<P>In the mona&s;tery of St. PIERRE, there is a grand library, filled with books in all languages; but it is chiefly remarkable for the &s;uperlative beauty of its ceiling, one half of which was painted by RU|BENS.</P>
<P>Thus you may perceive, my dear FREDERICK, the charity of the clergy!&mdash;how, in pure pity for the &s;ins of mankind, and in paternal care of their &s;ouls, they exact from the laity &s;ome atonement for their crimes, and con&s;train them at lea&s;t to repent &mdash;and, with unparalleled magnanimity, take upon them&s;elves the vices, the gluttony, the avarice, and the &s;en&s;uality, of which they are &s;o careful to purge their fellow-creatures.</P>

He at fir&s;t re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to pre&s;erve his life by means &s;o fatal and dete&s;table: This is not to be wondered at; for I hope, for the honour of our nature, that there are but few, very few &s;orts, who would not have &s;purned, with abhorrence, life &s;u&s;tained on conditions &s;o horrid, &s;o unnatural. The &s;on, though long inflexible, was at length overcome by the tears and entreaties of a fond father, who re|pre&s;ented to him, at all events, his (the father's) life was forfeited, and that it would be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible con&s;olation to him, at his la&s;t moments, to think, that in his death he was the in&s;trument of his &s;on's pre&s;ervation. The youth con&s;ented to adopt the horrible means of recovering his life and liber|ty: he lifted the axe; but, as it was about to fall, his arm &s;unk nervele&s;s, and the axe dropped from his hand! Had he as many lives as hairs, he would have yielded them all, one after the other, rather than again even conceive, much le&s;s perpetrate, &s;uch an act. Life, liberty, every thing, vani&s;hed before the dearer intere&s;ts of filial affection: he fell upon his father's neck, and, embracing him, triumphantly exclaimed, "My father, my father! we will die together!" and then called for ano|ther executioner to fulfil the &s;entence of the law.</P>

<P>From Ghent to Bru&s;&s;els (the next great &s;tage in my way), I found, to my regret, that there was no conveyance by water: I therefore was obliged to go in a voiture, and &s;topt at Alo&s;t, as an interme|diate &s;tage; and mathematically intermediate it is&mdash; for it lies at equal di&s;tance from Ghent and Bru&s;&s;els, being exactly fifteen miles from each.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="033487_0053_0FF722804FC39D30">This is a &s;mall, but exceeding neat town, &s;ituated on the river Dender; and being a remarkably great thoroughfare accommodations of every kind are to|lerably good in it.

<P>This country is bounded, to the north, by the Scheldt; to the north-we&s;t, by the Northern Sea: to the &s;outh, and &s;outh-we&s;t, by Artois, one of the fine&s;t Provinces of France; and to the ea&s;t, by Brabant. Its greate&s;t length is &s;eventy-five miles; and its greate&s;t breadth, fifty-five. The air is good; but it is &s;aid to be better in proportion as it recedes from the &s;ea. The winters are &s;ometimes long and &s;evere, and the &s;ummers &s;ometimes wet and &s;ultry; yet, in general, the climate is agreea|ble. The &s;oil is in mo&s;t parts fertile, and in &s;ome to a degree equal to that of any part of Europe. It is chiefly famous for its pa&s;turage; in con&s;e|quence of which, great numbers of black cattle, hor&s;es and &s;heep, are bred in it, and immen&s;e quan|tities of butter and chee&s;e made. It is, be&s;ides, abundantly productive of all &s;orts of culinary vege|tables&mdash;fruit in great quantities&mdash;corn and flax, which la&s;t is not only rai&s;ed in great plenty, but is celebrated for the finene&s;s and &s;trength of its &s;taple. It is true, that in &s;ome parts they have not corn &s;ufficient for the inhabitants; but this is well re|compen&s;ed by other productions, with the redun|dance of which they purcha&s;e the &s;uperfluous grain of their neighbours&mdash;for, where the inhabitants do follow tillage, the produce is unequalled, and the &s;uperfluity mu&s;t of cour&s;e be great.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior fecundity of the &s;heep of this country is very remarkable, and difficult, perhaps, to be accounted for&mdash;a ewe here bringing forth con&s;tantly three lambs at a birth, &s;ometimes four,
<PB N="57" REF="033487_0056_0FF72288CA84EEA0">
&s;ometimes five, and &s;ome have been known to pro|duce as many as &s;ix and &s;even&mdash;no &s;mall in&s;tance of the prodigality of nature in providing for this &s;pot.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, the face of the country is decorated with a profu&s;ion of wood, fitted either for timber or for fuel; and towards the coa&s;t, where nature has been rather niggard of that ble&s;&s;ing, the inhabitants &s;ub&s;titute, in its &s;tead, for fuel, a kind of turf, which they find at the depth of four or five feet from the &s;urface of the earth, and which makes a fire, not only cheerful, plea|&s;ant, and hot, but remarkably whole&s;ome, being free from the de&s;tructive &s;ulphurious and bitumi|nous vapour attendant upon coal.</P>
<P>Perhaps no part of the world is better &s;upplied than this province with all &s;orts of fi&s;h, as well tho&s;e of &s;ea as fre&s;h water: fowl and veni&s;on were extremely plenty and rea&s;onable; and a great deal of excellent beer was brewed in it. It is wa&s;hed by &s;everal rivers, four of which are noble &s;treams, namely, the Scheldt, the Lys, the Scarpe, and the Dender; and there are &s;everal canals, the chief of which is that between Bruges and Ghent.</P>
<P>Thus in whatever way it be con&s;idered, nature &s;eems to have made ample provi&s;ion for the happi|ne&s;s of the people: how far they are &s;o, you &s;hall hear when I come to give a general view of the Netherlands&mdash;that which is applicable to Au&s;trian Flanders being equally &s;o to all the other parts of the Netherlands, excepting tho&s;e under the domi|nion of the Republic of the United States.</P>
<P>The States of this country, according to the con|&s;titution it once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ted of clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The clergy were the bi&s;hops and abbots: the nobility was compo&s;ed of certain families holding hereditary offices or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aronies, to which that privilege was annexed; and
<PB N="58" REF="033487_0057_0FF7228B69EC0670">
the commoners were made up of the burgoma&s;ters, pen&s;ioners and deputies of the cities and di&s;tricts. But the only religion profe&s;&s;ed or tolerated in this country, was the Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>Of the people of Au&s;trian Flanders a celebrated Author gives the following account, which I tran&s;|cribe for your u&s;e, the rather as my &s;tay there was too &s;hort to enable me to make any material ob&s;er|vations on them, or their manners.&mdash;</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to the per&s;ons and characters of the inhabitants," &s;ays he, "they are, generally &s;peaking, lu&s;ty, fat, and clum&s;y&mdash;very indu&s;trious, both in cultivating their lands, and in their trades and manufactures&mdash;lovers of liberty, and enemies to &s;lavery&mdash;and not defective in good &s;en&s;e or judg|ment, though they have not &s;o lively an imagina|tion as &s;ome other nations. Their women are fair, hand&s;ome enough, and hone&s;t by their natural con|&s;titution, as well as from a principle of virtue: as they cannot pretend to wit and repartee, they do not make them&s;elves ridiculous by the nau&s;eous affectation of them. Both &s;exes are great lovers of public diver&s;ions; and every city, town, and vil|lage, have their kermi&s;&s;es, or fairs, in which all &s;orts of &s;hews are exhibited."</P>
<P>Many arts which now enrich other nations, and the importance of which has excited conte&s;ts and &s;truggles of the mo&s;t &s;erious kind in the political world, were invented or improved in that country. Weaving, in general, though not invented, was greatly improved; and the art of forming figures of all &s;orts in linen was fir&s;t invented there. To the Flemings we are al&s;o indebted for the arts of curing herrings, dyeing cloths and &s;tuffs, and oil-colours. But tho&s;e arts, and the manufactures, have gradually &s;lid away from them, and left but a &s;mall &s;hare behind, when compared with their former flouri&s;hing &s;tate; they have flown to a land of

liberty and &s;ecurity, where ho&s;tile feet never tread, where &s;lavery corrupteth not, where war devoureth not, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Prie&s;ts no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> De&s;pots break in and &s;teal. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ilk, cotton and woollen &s;tuffs, broc|ades, camblets, tape&s;try, linen, and lace, are &s;till manufactured here to &s;ome &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>This province had counts of its own, from the ninth century up to the year 1369, when it was made over, by marriage, (l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke a farm of cattle) to the dukes of Burgundy; and afterwards, again, was by them made over, in like way of marriage, to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In 1667 France &s;eized the &s;outhern part; and the States General obtained the northern, partly by the treaty of Mun&s;ter, and partly by the Barrier treaty of 1715.</P>
<P>To reckon upon the natural endowments of this country, one would &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;hould be a ter|re&s;trial paradi&s;e: yet &s;uch is the wickedne&s;s of man, and the outrageous &s;pirit of power, that it is almo&s;t the la&s;t country in Europe in which I would have property, and fix a permanent re&s;idence. Ju&s;t now, while I am writing, I have before me an ac|count, that the French, to whom they have opened their gates, have plundered them to the la&s;t atom of their moveable po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ions; and that the pro|perty of the unfortunate people is now in waggons, on its way to Paris.</P>
<P>Once more, my boy, I &s;ay, ble&s;s your GOD, that planted you in a country cheered by the voice of freedom, defended by Briti&s;h valour, and, what is of more con&s;equence, &s;urrounded by the Ocean.</P>

<P>HAVING conducted you through that part of the Netherlands called Au&s;trian Flanders, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are now to direct our attention to that called Au&s;trian Brabant, of which part, as well as of the Netherlands in general, Bru&s;&s;els, where I arrived the &s;ame day I left Ghent, is the capital, giving its name to a quarter or territory that &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>In all parts of the Netherlands through which I travelled, I could not help admiring the uniform decorations of the roads, rivers, and canals, with rows of lofty trees, which form a mo&s;t agreeable &s;hade from the &s;ummer's burning &s;un, and yet do not ob&s;truct any great extent of pro&s;pect, the coun|try is &s;o extremely flat. And one thing I remark|ed, and which certainty &s;eems at fir&s;t view, extra|ordinary, is, that in the great extent of country through which we have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed, from O&s;|tend to Bru&s;&s;els, being &s;ixty-eight miles, I &s;carce &s;aw one nobleman or gentleman's &s;eat&mdash;nothing above the hou&s;e of a hu&s;bandman, a curate, or &s;ome per&s;on of &s;mall fortune: and yet the country is extremely rich; and I &s;aw many &s;pots, as I went along, charming beyond de&s;cription, and &s;uch as would tempt, I &s;hould think, a man of ta&s;te and opulence to &s;ettle in them. This mu&s;t appear un|accountable to tho&s;e who do not recollect, that in a country &s;ubject like this to the ravaging incur&s;i|ons of contending armies, fortified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owns are con|&s;idered as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, becau&s;e the mo&s;t &s;e|cure retreats of opulence.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="033487_0060_0FF72294E70DA670">As I approached the city of Bru&s;&s;els, I was &s;truck with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of &s;urpri&s;e and de|light at the appearance it made&mdash;none that I had ever &s;een being comparable to it, and not one in Europe, by the account of travellers, being in that re&s;pect &s;uperior to it, Naples and Genoa only ex|cepted: like them, however, it, when entered, falls far &s;hort of the expectation rai&s;ed by its ex|ternal appearance, being all compo&s;ed of hills and hollows, which not only fatigue, but render the appearance of the &s;treets, though well built, con|temptible and mean.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els &s;tands on the beautiful little river Senne, on the brow of a hill. The city is about &s;even miles in circumference, has &s;even gates, with ex|ten&s;ive &s;uburbs, and is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double wall made of brick, and ditches; but its &s;ize is too great for &s;trength, as a face of defence of &s;uch ex|tent could not po&s;&s;ibly hold out a long &s;iege&mdash;a great and in&s;uperable defect in &s;uch a country as I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Great as is the extent of ground on which this city &s;tands, it is neverthele&s;s very well built, and extremely populous. It is ornamented with no fewer than &s;even &s;quares, all of them remarkably fine, particularly the great &s;quare or market place, which is reckoned to be perhaps the fine&s;t in Eu|rope. Around it are the halls of the different trades, the fronts of which are adorned, in a &s;u|perb manner, with emblematical &s;culpture, with gilding, and a variety of Latin in&s;criptions. One quarter of this &s;quare is entirely occupied by the town-hou&s;es, a noble pile of building, in which there were apartments where the States of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inely adorned with tape&s;try in gift frames, and &s;ome admirable original paintings. At the time I was there, the whole city was in motion, preparing for the Inauguration of the EMPEROR, who was then impatiently expected, and who&s;e ap|proach
<PB N="62" REF="033487_0061_0FF72296726BBAE8">
made &s;uch a bu&s;tle, and promi&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pectacle, as made me regret the nece&s;&s;ity I lay under of proceeding on my journey. The town-hou&s;e was put into the highe&s;t order, and &s;ub&s;e|quently fell a &s;acrifice to the great and important event for which it was prepared.</P>
<P>The &s;teeple of this building is of a mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous height&mdash;three hundred and &s;ixty-four feet; and on the top of it is erected a &s;tatue of Saint MICHAEL killing the Dragon, of the enormous height of &s;eventeen feet: this colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue is &s;o con&s;tructed as to &s;erve for a weather-cock; and be|ing made of copper, well gilt, is at once con&s;pi|cuous, magnificent, and ornamental.</P>
<P>The public buildings of Bru&s;&s;els, particularly the palaces and courts of the &s;everal princes, counts, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, (and, you may be &s;ure, the churches and cloi&s;ters too), are &s;pacious, expen&s;ive, and magnificent. Behind the imperial palace, which &s;tood in the highe&s;t part of the city, but was burnt down many years ago, is a park, well &s;tocked with deer, and planted with trees, like St. James's-park at London, for the inhabitants to walk in. At the farther end of it is a fine plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, built by the Emperor CHARLES the fifth, after his abdication.</P>
<P>The palace is a magnificent &s;tructure: the rooms of it are fini&s;hed in a &s;tyle far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any palace in England, and enriched with many fine paintings: that of the family of HECTOR, in the council chamber, lays claim to the fir&s;t rank of eminence. Of the other buildings (the grandeur of which entitle them to the names of palaces), tho&s;e of the Prince de la Tour and Taxis, and the Briti&s;h Earl of Ayle&s;bury, are di&s;tingu&s;hed by great beauty and magnificence. Indeed, in all the pala|ces, there are collections of original paintings, by the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters, both Italian and Flemi&s;h.</P>

Look to Mexico!&mdash;&s;ee a mon&s;ter, a high prie&s;t of your religion, collecting, by fair pro|mi&s;es and &s;weet pur&s;ua&s;ion, a people round him; and, when a plain was filled, commanding his blood-hounds, armed with &s;word and crucifix, to fall upon and murder them&mdash;becau&s;e one poor creature, who knew not what a book meant, had acciden|tally dropped a bible from his hands!&mdash;&s;ee him not &s;paring age or &s;ex, but butchering all, for the love of CHRIST!&mdash;When have the deluded and en|frenzied mob of France perpetrated, in the full torrent of popular frenzy, &s;uch atrocities as this cruel prie&s;t committed in cold blood? when have they hunted down their follow creatures, ma&s;&s;acred children, and given their yet panting members to their dogs for food, as pious Chri&s;tians, headed by a pious prie&s;t, have done in Mexico? Never! ne|ver! &mdash;Learn wi&s;dom, then, ye hypocrites! and if you cannot convince your enemies by rea&s;on, or conquer them by force, and if their predatory and wicked progre&s;s is not to be &s;topped, do not &s;anc|tify their enormities, or palliate their crimes, in the eye of rea&s;on, by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of a deeper dye: remember, that "not to be the wor&s;t &s;tands in &s;ome rank of prai&s;e," and that the Jaco|bin cruelties of Paris, horrible though they were, were pity and tender mercy, compared with the

Chri&s;tian butchery in Mexico, in Europe, in A&s;ia, in every place where Popery ever &s;et its bloody hoof.</P>
<P>You are not, from what I &s;ay, to infer that I entertain any illiberal animo&s;ity to Popery, as many men, and more women, do, merely becau&s;e its ar|ticles of faith differ from tho&s;e in which I was bred; I tru&s;t my heart and under&s;tanding are above &s;uch very degrading prejudices: but I abhor every thing that militates again&s;t human happine&s;s&mdash;every thing that cru&s;hes the operations of intellect&mdash;every thing that &s;tops the current of opinion, and pre|vents its cour&s;e from enlarging and meliorating our condition: I abhor the impertinent and hypocriti|cal intru&s;ion of all churchmen upon national or do|me&s;tic concerns; the more, when that intru&s;ion is mi&s;chievous; and more &s;till, when it a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of piety&mdash;for that is at once a fraud upon man and an abu&s;e of GOD. All tho&s;e cau&s;es of abhor|rence attach, more or le&s;s, to all &s;ects of the Chri&s;|tian religion, the Quakers only excepted&mdash;but to Popery rather more than to any of the others; for it is ob&s;erved, that while the very fir&s;t principles of Chri&s;tianity, as originally laid down in theory, are peace and good-will towards men, warfare, per|&s;ecution, and blood&s;hed, have practically marked its foot&s;teps wherever it has trod, and its very e&s;&s;ence been perverted by its own mini&s;ters, who, entru&s;ted with the key of the temple, &s;teal the ve&s;tments from the alter, to cover the deformed, crookrd back of vice. But the rays of dawning rea&s;on now break with fuller light upon mankind; and it ha&s;|tens to meridian re&s;plendence, before which tho&s;e phantoms rai&s;ed by pious jugglers will vani&s;h, and, "like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leave not a wreck behind."</P>

<P>IN the ar&s;enal of Bru&s;&s;els was another cu|rio&s;ity, which I overlooked in my la&s;t&mdash;a model of a cannon, con&s;tructed &s;o as to throw &s;even balls at once. It is &s;ome con&s;olation to philanthropy to re|flect, that of all the abominable engines and in&s;tru|ments which the inventive faculties of man have di&s;covered to increa&s;e the cruelty and carnage of war, not one has been of late times adopted. This model lies here, therefore, only as a memorial of the diabolical genius of the inventor.</P>
<P>The opera-hou&s;e of Bru&s;&s;els, accounted the no|ble&s;t and large&s;t in Europe, is built after the Italian manner, with rows of lodges or clo&s;ets, in mo&s;t of which are chimneys. One of tho&s;e, which belong|ed to a prince, who&s;e title I now forget, was hung with looking-gla&s;&s;es, in which, while he &s;at by the fire, took refre&s;hments, or reclined on his couch, he could &s;ee the whole repre&s;entation, without be|ing expo&s;ed to the view of either the actors or the audience.</P>
<P>The markets of Bru&s;&s;els are very remarkable. The dukes of St. Pierre paid no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and florins, or upwards of three thou&s;and pounds Sterling, for four pictures of them, painted by RUBENS and SYNDER&mdash;LEWIS the Fourteenth of France offered an immen&s;e &s;um of money for them; but they found their way at la&s;t into the collection of the Briti&s;h Earl of Orford. The va|lue of them is &s;aid, by connoi&s;&s;eurs, to be beyond computation.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els is extremely well &s;upplied with water: for, be&s;ides the river, it has twenty public foun|tains,
<PB N="67" REF="033487_0066_0FF722A36A8813A8">
adorned with &s;tatues, at the corners of the mo&s;t public &s;treets; and the lower part of the city is cut into canals, which communicate with the great one, extending from Bru&s;&s;els to the Scheldt, fifteen miles: by means of this canal, which was fini&s;hed in 1561, and co&s;t the city eight hundred thou&s;and florins, a per&s;on may &s;ail from Bru&s;&s;els to the North Sea; and barques do actually go twice a-day to Antwerp, and back again.</P>
<P>This city is full of churches, of which the mo&s;t remarkable is that of Saint MICHAEL and Saint GUDULA, commonly called the cathedral. It is a &s;uperb, old Gothic &s;tructure, and, from its celebra|ted &s;ituation, a mo&s;t beautiful ornament to the city. It is not only grand in its external appearance, but finely adorned within. The pillars which &s;upport the roof are lofty and elegant: and again&s;t each is a &s;tatue of ten feet in height. There are no le&s;s than &s;ixteen chapels in it; and each chapel is en|riched with abundance of &s;plendid ornaments, altar finery, candle-&s;ticks, crucifixes, &amp;c. and with &s;ome excellent pictures too: a picture of JESUS CHRIST pre&s;enting the keys of Paradi&s;e to Saint PETER, which is reckoned among the chef-d'oeuvres of RUBENS, hangs in one of tho&s;e chapels. There are &s;ome monuments, al&s;o, of very great merit, in the choir of this church. But that which I think by far the greate&s;t and mo&s;t admirable curio&s;ity (I mean of human workman&s;hip) in the church, is a pulpit&mdash;one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t exqui&s;itely wrought pieces I have ever &s;een: at the bottom are &s;een ADAM and EVE as large as life, repre&s;ented as at the moment when the angel drove them out of Paradi&s;e: in both of their faces are deeply and ex|pre&s;&s;ively marked the traits of a mind agoni&s;ed with angui&s;h and remor&s;e: behind EVE is a figure of Death, which follows them; and on the top of the pulpit are &s;een the figures of JESUS CHRIST and the Virgin MARY cru&s;hing the head of the
<PB N="68" REF="033487_0067_0FF722A5157D6760">
Serpent. The &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions in the faces of all tho&s;e figures, and the exqui&s;ite turn of the workman&s;hip. is the more remarkable, as it is all cut out of oak wood.</P>
<P>Of &s;upernatural curio&s;ities, one of the chapels in this cathedral contains &s;ome, that, for miracle, yield to none in the long catalogue of monki&s;h de|vices. Three ho&s;ts or wafers are daily wor&s;hipped by the people; which ho&s;ts or wafers, the prie&s;ts firmly a&s;&s;ert, and the people as firmly believe, were, &s;o long ago as the year 1369, &s;tabbed by a Jew, and bled profu&s;ely. They are expo&s;ed on every fe&s;tival, in a chalice richly &s;et with diamonds; and on the fir&s;t Sunday after every thirteenth of July, there is a yearly proce&s;&s;ion in memory of this &s;tab|bing and bleeding, when the ho&s;ts are carried in great &s;tate round the city, embelli&s;hed with all man|ner of precious &s;tones, and attended by all the clergy, &s;ecular and regular, the magi&s;trates, the courts of ju&s;tice, and even by the governor of the province: the chapel where they are kept is of marble, and the altar of &s;olid &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Great GOD! what an opprobium to the human under&s;tanding, that, at the time when the mind of man is &s;ufficiently enlightened to avoid the weak|ne&s;s of &s;hameful credulity, a whole people &s;hould &s;toop to &s;uch extravagant impo&s;ition! what a &s;hame to ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty, that tho&s;e who are tru&s;ted to guard the rights of a people, and who certainly are too well informed to yield their belief to &s;uch tra&s;h, &s;hould yet join in, and give the weight of their authority to &s;o gro&s;s, &s;o wicked a deception on a community! The magi&s;trates, the courts of ju&s;tice, and the governor&mdash;they walk, too, in company with the bald-pated impo&s;tors&mdash;Good GOD! can more be &s;aid? volumes of comment could not elucidate or render it more con&s;picuou&s;ly ab&s;urd than the bare recital of the fact it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="033487_0068_0FF722AAD5124598">It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to recount to you the num|ber of nunneries, of various orders, in which un|fortunate women were cloi&s;tered up, &s;ome from bigotry, and others by force, in this city. There were, however, two of them Engli&s;h&mdash;one of Do|minican ladies, founded by Cardinal HOWARD, in the reign of CHARLES the Second, of which a lady of the noble Hou&s;e of Norfolk was always abbe&s;s: the other is of Benedictine nuns; the Beguinage of the latter is like a little town, &s;urrounded with a wall and ditch, and divided into pretty little &s;treets, where every Beguine has her apartment; the num|ber of them amounts in general to &s;even or eight hundred, &s;ometimes more.</P>
<P>If population be the true &s;trength of a nation, this part, of Popery is very impolitic. The &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of women in this one convent &s;ince the reign of CHARLES the Second, mu&s;t amount to many thou&s;ands. Had tho&s;e been married, and, on an average, had only two children each, with the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, down to the pre&s;ent day, in all the ramifications of de&s;cent, there is no doubt but their number would equal that of the whole people of &s;ome exten&s;ive provinces. What, then, mu&s;t be the lo&s;s to the po|pulation of the earth, ari&s;ing from the celibacy of &s;o many millions of males and females as have been con&s;igned to &s;terility in the catholic countries, ever &s;ince that extraordinary doctrine came fir&s;t into fa&s;hion? It is out of the reach of calculation: not but, now and then, they may have children&mdash;indeed they certainly have but tho&s;e are generally di&s;po&s;ed of in a way not to bring &s;hame on the frail Si&s;ter|hood, or their Confe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In wading through &s;uch a torrent of offen&s;ive ideas as the innumerable ab&s;urdities and deceptions of Popi&s;h countries continually rai&s;e in the mind, it is a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance to be relieved by the contemplation of &s;ome really u&s;eful, humane in&s;ti|tution;
<PB N="70" REF="033487_0069_0FF722D9058CF5A0">
and &s;uch a one pre&s;ents it&s;elf now to my recollection: At Bru&s;&s;els, and, I am told, at all great towns of the Netherlands, there is a public office for lending money at a very moderate intere&s;t upon pledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: it is called the Mount of Piety; and was e&s;tabli&s;hed nearly 108 years ago by the Archduke, ALBERT, and ISABELLA, his wife. By this in&s;titution, the poor are &s;aved from the fleecings and frauds of pawn-brokers: and to ren|der it &s;till more perfect in accommodation, there are private pa&s;&s;ages for entrance: &s;o that tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to conceal their nece&s;&s;ities, are exempt|ed from the mortification of being &s;een publicly going in, or coming out.</P>
<P>You have read, I pre&s;ume, that in the days of Heatheni&s;m, the Deities of that curious Mythology were &s;uppo&s;ed to rejoice in the number Three. The Popi&s;h Code has fixed upon Seven as the lucky number. Thus they have &s;even &s;acraments, &s;even deadly &s;ins, &amp;c. &amp;c. Bru&s;&s;els has improved upon that; and, taking the hint from their ble&s;&s;ed liturgy, has &s;even grand &s;treets; &s;even pari&s;h-churches; &s;even Patrician families, out of which the Magi&s;trates are or were elected; &s;even large &s;quares; &s;even midwives, licen&s;ed and &s;worn by the Senate; and &s;even gates, leading to &s;even pla|ces of recreations and exerci&s;e, one to a place pro|per for fowling, a &s;econd to a place for fi&s;hing, a third to one far hunting, a fourth to plea&s;ant fields, a fifth to pa&s;time grounds, a &s;ixth to &s;prings and vineyards, and a &s;eventh to gardens. Be&s;ides all which &s;evens, they boa&s;t of having once had the great good fortune of entertaining, at one time, &s;even crowned heads, with &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e belonging to their retinue. If there were any &s;pell in the number Seven, the people of Bru&s;&s;els &s;ure|ly mu&s;t have been &s;ecure from all mi&s;chief; but the <HI>Sans-Culottes</HI> have broken the charm, di&s;per&s;ed the
<PB N="71" REF="033487_0070_0FF67B9FF354BB58">
necromancers, and lowered poor number Seven to its mere arithmetical value.</P>
<P>The inns, or eating hou&s;es, in this city, were equal to any in the world: a &s;tranger might dine there better and cheaper than in any place perhaps, on earth.

<P>HITHERTO, as I have proceeded on my travels, I have been purpo&s;ely very particular in my de&s;criptions of the towns through which I pa&s;&s;ed on my way to India, in order to give your mind a di&s;po&s;ition to inquiry, and point out to you an overflowing &s;ource of improvement and delight. Having &s;o far &s;hewn you how amply you will be

rewarded, even in amu&s;ement, by the trouble of &s;earching into books, for the accurate topographical de&s;criptions of towns, cities, buildings, &amp;c. &amp;c. I think I may &s;pare my&s;elf that labour for the fu|ture, and confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e points that more immediately apply to the enlargement of the mind &mdash;I mean, the government, laws, manners, and character of the people of each country; and only u&s;e the former as &s;ub&s;ervient to the latter purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t until I come to tho&s;e places where, the ground being but little trodden by Briti&s;h feet, more preci&s;e de&s;cription may become nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>Although per&s;onal appearance be, in the eye of Moral Philo&s;ophy, a very inferior con&s;ideration, and mind the proper &s;tudy of man; yet in de&s;crib|ing a people, I cannot think it altogether unnece&s;|&s;ary to include their per&s;onal appearance, as it will be found that there exi&s;ts a greater analogy between the per&s;on and the mind of men than is generally perceived.

<P>In the year 1781, the Emperor JOSEPH the Se|cond came to Bru&s;&s;els, in order to indulge his pa|ternal feelings as a monarch with the contemplation and view of his &s;ubjects, and al&s;o to be inaugurated; and perhaps upon no occa&s;ion that has ever occur|red in the mo&s;t volatile nation, was there greater joy more univer&s;ally expre&s;&s;ed.

and, even with them, dome&s;tic indu&s;try &s;topped its u&s;ual per&s;evering pace, &s;u&s;pended in the eager, anxious expectation of his arrival. Every thing in the birth, education, natural di&s;po&s;ition and per&s;on of the young Emperor, united to impre&s;s his &s;ub|jects with the mo&s;t exalted opinion of his goodne&s;s, and to in&s;pire all ranks of people with the mo&s;t fortunate pre&s;ages of a wi&s;e and beneficent govern|ment. Nor did he di&s;appoint them: his conduct, when among them, is handed over to remembrance, by a variety of acts of benevolence and conde&s;cen|&s;ion, which &s;howed that the grandeur of the mo|narch had not made him forget the nature of the man, and that his heart was better fitted for the mild, dome&s;tic enjoyments of a &s;ubject, than the &s;tern and unbending hardihood fit for a King: for I am perfectly of opinion with the celebrated JU|NIUS, that there are virtues in a private man which are vices in a King; and that the monarch of a country, in order to pre&s;erve re&s;pect, &s;hould avoid familiarity, and keep his per&s;on &s;acred from too general ob&s;ervation.

<P>The affability of monarchs has often been magni|fied by the fooli&s;h, and often blamed by the wi&s;e: But, if all the in&s;tances of eonde&s;cen&s;ion practi&s;ed by kings were like that I have recited of JOSEPH; if they aro&s;e from a &s;ound, unque&s;tionable &s;pirit of philanthropy, not from gaping curio&s;ity, broad fol|ly, or a peurile inqui&s;itive habit; and if, in&s;tead of conceiving tho&s;e they vi&s;it paid for their intru|&s;ion with the honour of having conver&s;ed with ma|je&s;ty, and leaving them churli&s;hly, they would ge|nerou&s;ly pay them with hard ca&s;h, as the good Em|peror JOSEPH did; then, indeed, their affability

<P>On the 13th of July, the ceremony of inaugura|tion took place at Bru&s;&s;els. Nothing could equal the &s;plendour of the place but the general joy of the people: the crowds were beyond all conception immen&s;e, and every thing was carried on with re|gularity till evening, when, in playing off &s;ome fire-works, that noble building the town-hou&s;e took fire, and was burnt: &s;ix unfortunate per&s;ons lo&s;t their lives, and twenty were dangerou&s;ly hurt|ed: tho&s;e who peri&s;hed were ab&s;olutely roa&s;ted, and their cries were beyond de&s;cription piercing. To &s;uch a temper as JOSEPH'S, you will readily conclude that this mu&s;t be a mo&s;t afflicting circum|&s;tance &mdash;it was &s;o; and he left Bru&s;&s;els under the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">re of very different feelings from tho&s;e with which he entered it, and was followed by the pray|ers and ble&s;&s;ings of all the people.</P>
<P>But now we are to view the rever&s;e of the me|dal. The &s;ound of their prayers for his welfare, and prai&s;es of his goodne&s;s, had hardly died away upon their lips, ere their minds turned to revolt and rebellion. I will not &s;ay that they were not right in one or other, or which of tho&s;e two ex|tremes: certainly they could not be right in both; much le&s;s can their &s;ub&s;equent conduct be ju&s;tified, or accounted for, in any principle of human nature, but that of the mo&s;t abject meanne&s;s, da&s;tardly fee|blene&s;s, and gro&s;s folly. They returned to their allegiance, and be&s;ought forgivene&s;s: that forgive|ne&s;s was granted. How they have behaved &s;ince, I have already informed you, (&s;ee Letter IV.); and I have now to add, that, pillaged by the French, and likely to be left unprotected, they have again held their necks out, &s;oliciting the protection and the yoke of Au&s;tria, and have actually offered to rai&s;e 100,000 men for the Emperor, <HI>if</HI> he will again

<P>How a people, once formed for manly pith and love of freedom, could bend &s;o low, is unaccount|able. It is a que&s;tion hard to be determined, whe|ther an ob&s;tinate adherence even to a bad cau&s;e, is not more re&s;pectable, than a fickle, alternate dere|liction, and adoption of right and wrong, as it &s;uits the caprice or convenience of the moment? Of two things &s;o very contemptible, I think the for|mer the lea&s;t odious and lea&s;t unmanly.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, my ob&s;ervations on the coun|try led me to conceive, that under the name of freedom, they groaned under the yoke of tyranny; for, though the country was, as I have de&s;cribed it, charming, its fecundity un&s;urpa&s;&s;ed, its face deco|rated with the be&s;t gifts of Providence&mdash;I mean, &s;miling fields and bleating plains&mdash;though <HI>Ceres</HI> profu&s;ely repaid the labours of the hu&s;bandman, though every field had the appearance of a garden, and though, upon inquiry, I found that land which would bring in England five pounds an acre, rented at eight, nine, and ten &s;hillings of our money at mo&s;t&mdash;yet, in &s;pite of all this, the farmers were rather poor in general&mdash;not even one of them to be found rich and &s;ub&s;tantial, like the middle rank of that cla&s;s of men in England. They wanted the great &s;timulus to indu&s;try&mdash;&s;ecurity of their pro|perty: they were liable to be turned out by their landlords at plea&s;ure, and be plundered when it &s;hould plea&s;e &s;ome monarch to make war.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, however, you will ob&s;erve, is not the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Emperor: it is a tyranny of that wor&s;t of all con&s;tituent parts of a &s;tate, an ari&s;tocracy&mdash;a vile ari&s;tocracy!&mdash;that univer&s;al, that every-day de&s;poti&s;m, under which all places groan, more or le&s;s&mdash;which is exerci&s;ed in all the various gradations of life that chequer &s;ociety, from the great man who, under the name of mini&s;ter, domi|neers

<P>Having &s;een as much of Bru&s;&s;els as my time and occa&s;ions would at all allow, and, in truth, having rather tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on my plan, for the rea&s;ons ju&s;t mentioned, I determined to pu&s;h forward as fa&s;t as it was po&s;&s;ible, and took po&s;t for Liege, where I arrived, after pa&s;&s;ing through a beautiful, fertile, well-cultivated country, to the charms of which the renewed agony of my feelings redered me al|mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>As we have now almo&s;t the whole length of Germany before us to travel through, it will be proper, before I proceed further, to give you a ge|neral idea of the con&s;titution of this ve&s;t empire&mdash; over all which, while one great monarch nominally pre&s;ides, there are &s;pread a number of petty poten|tates, who really rule after as di&s;tinct forms of go|vernment as almo&s;t any two governments, however remote in Europe.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the nature of government ab&s;tracted|ly, one would &s;uppo&s;e that it aro&s;e from the general will of the &s;ociety governed, and was formed for their u&s;e and benefit alone: but if we view the dif|ferent &s;y&s;tems &s;cattered over the civilized part of the earth, we &s;hall find that they originated from force and fraud; and that, in their fir&s;t formation, when bodily prowe&s;s, not intellectual power, bore &s;way&mdash;when he that could carry the &s;tronge&s;t ar|mour, and &s;trike the heavie&s;t blows, was &s;ure to govern&mdash;when mere animal &s;trength and ferocity di&s;inherited rea&s;on of her rights, and robbed her of that a&s;cendency to which the invention of gunpowder, aided by the art of printing, has &s;ince in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;tored her&mdash;the ba&s;is upon which

Hence aro&s;e the cabals and intrigues of courts, the &s;pirit of party, and inte&s;tine commo|tion; till at length the people, for their own &s;ecu|rity, and to avoid the horrors of civil war, made choice (from di&s;mal nece&s;&s;ity) of &s;ome one family to rule them. As &s;ociety advanced, and opulence held forth temptation, &s;ome greater ruffian, follow|ed by a horde of needy, fami&s;hed barbarians, made incur&s;ions on tho&s;e rulers; and being irre&s;i&s;tible, as well from numbers firmly connected, as from the powerful impul&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, under who&s;e banners they generally robbed and ravaged, was &s;ubmitted to on terms, and became Lord Paramount of a num|ber of petty &s;overeigns, who did homage to him, and fleeced the mi&s;erable &s;ubjects, to keep him in humour; and thus, in a &s;eries of time, the power of both took root, and remained immoveable, unle&s;s when torn up by &s;ome violent tempe&s;t that convu&s;|ed the &s;tate, and &s;hook it to its foundations.</P>

<P>Upon a retro&s;pective view of the Hi&s;tory of Eu|rope, it will be found, that for a long time after the birth of CHRIST, Germany was divided among &s;uch petty rulers as I have de&s;cribed, who each held his little &s;tate in &s;overeignty, and was called <HI>Princeps</HI> in Latin, or, in plain Engli&s;h, <HI>Prince.</HI> After the downfal of the We&s;tern Empire, a nation called <HI>Franks,</HI> from that part called <HI>Franconia,</HI> over-ran a great part of Gaul and Germany, and in the fifth century took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that part of Gaul which lay north of the river Loire. In the year 800, CHARLEMAGNE, the &s;on of PEPIN, their king, formed an immen&s;e empire in the we&s;t, comprehending a great part of Germany, France, Italy, and a part of Spain. About eighty years af|terwards, the petty princes of Germany &s;hook off the French Carlovinian race, and elected an em|peror of their own from the Hou&s;e of Bavaria.</P>

JOSEPH the Second, that good and wi&s;e monarh, di&s;played a greater &s;pirit of toleration than any other Catholic prince &s;ince HENRY the Fourth of France. He was not murdered by a friar for it, it is true&mdash;tho&s;e days of pious barbarity are pa&s;t; but he was vi&s;i|ted on the occa&s;ion by his Holine&s;s, who, after a variety of remon&s;trances again&s;t the relaxation he gave to religious &s;everity in his own dominions, finding him unmoved by papers, re&s;olved to attack him in per&s;on; but, whether it was that the pon|tifical amulet lo&s;t its charm when out of the air of Rome, or that his Holine&s;s was not properly anointed before (like <HI>Hecate</HI> in <HI>Macbeth</HI>) he took his flight, or that he forgot &s;ome of tho&s;e reliques which were expected to operate on JOSEPH'S mind, &s;o it was, that the good emperor continued inflexi|bly attached to his former re&s;olve; and, after ki&s;&s;|ing his Holine&s;s' toe, and a thou&s;and other pretty politene&s;&s;es, &s;ent him back to Rome again with his finger in his mouth; and a &s;tory to relate. that would, at one time, have &s;et all Europe in a flame, and &s;ent the good monarch, like HENRY the Se|cond of England, to la&s;h him&s;elf naked over the rotten remains of &s;ome vagabond fraudulent prie&s;t.</P>

A&s;&s;uredly, the impo&s;ing a bi&s;hopric upon him mu&s;t be a great act of violence on his inclinations: for I cannot think it po&s;&s;ible that a Chri&s;tian divine would, in the fir&s;t place, commit the crime of &s;imony by &s;eeking preferment, and gaining it by pro&s;titution; much le&s;s can I be|lieve that he would be guilty, at the holy altar, of a &s;olemn act of perjury, by &s;wearing <HI>nolo epi&s;copari,</HI> if he was not actually, and <HI>bon&acirc; fid&ecirc;,</HI> aver&s;e to a bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Liege, however, may be fairly acquitted on the &s;core of his temporal half, for the &s;hare of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions committed by his &s;piritual half.

vanities of prince of Liege, duke of Bouillon, marquis of Franchemont, count of Looz, &amp;c.

<P>Of all kinds of &s;lavery, that nation groans be|neath the wor&s;t, which has the name, without the e&s;&s;ence, of a free con&s;titution; and Germany abounds with &s;uch. By the con&s;titution of this bi&s;hopric, the government con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;tates, the fir&s;t is the chapter of Liege; the &s;econd, the nobility; and the third, the deputies of the towns and capital. The&s;e, however, are very &s;eldom call|ed together, except to <HI>rai&s;e taxes,</HI> or on &s;ome &s;uch <HI>extraordinary</HI> emergency: but there is a committee of the &s;tates who meet three times a-week, and in time of war daily; they are always about the prince bi&s;hop, to make remon&s;trances, and demand the redre&s;s of grievances&mdash;from whence we may rea|&s;onably infer, that the people are well protected, or at lea&s;t well governed; the continual intercour&s;e between the committee and bi&s;hops, no doubt, tending to promote a very happy influence in fa|vour of the people!</P>
<P>In forming this con&s;titution, &s;pecial care has been taken to give the fir&s;t &s;tate a great preponderance. The chapter is to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ixty per&s;ons, who mu&s;t either prove their nobility for four generations, both by father and mother, or have been doctors or licentiates of divinity for &s;even years, or of law for five years, in &s;ome famous univer&s;ity, before they can be admitted.</P>
<P>How is it that the profe&s;&s;ion of the law &s;hould bear &s;uch potent &s;way in almo&s;t all countries&mdash;that even in Liege, a Catholic country and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, five years &s;tudy of the law &s;hould be deemed an equal qualification of &s;even of divinity?

In England, and its dependencies, the a&s;cendancy of the law is &s;till greater; and even in America, that profe&s;&s;ion is the fir&s;t &s;tep to &s;tate honours. The truth is, that the &s;cience of the law, which, however de&s;picable in practice, is the noble&s;t of human &s;ciences, quickens and invigorates the un|der&s;tanding more than all the other kinds of learn|ing put together; while the &s;tudy of divinity (I do not mean real divinity or morality, but that whim&s;ical jumble of miracles and incongruities, of ful&s;ome cant and &s;en&s;ele&s;s rhap&s;ody, called &s;o by churchmen) contracts the under&s;tanding, and bends it into a kind of crooked cunning. Formerly, the clergy were the di&s;pen&s;ers of the laws, and they alone &s;tudied it&mdash;Happy times! happy people! When the united powers of both lawyers and prie&s;ts were lodged in the &s;ame per&s;on, it is no wonder that they were able to en&s;lave the per&s;ons, when they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the under&s;tanding, of the people&mdash;that we at this day &s;ee &s;o many &s;tu|pendous monuments remaining of their pride and power, and that the bloated load of epi&s;copacy &s;till has its votaries and &s;upporters.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hopric of Liege is very populous and ex|ten&s;ive, containing many large towns, many baro|nies and &s;eigniories, &s;eventeen abbeys for men, who mu&s;t be all gentlemen, and eleven for ladies, ex|clu&s;ive of &s;warms of inferior note. In this di&s;tri|bution of the abbeys, male and female, I do not think that &s;ufficient regard has been had to equality of numbers: I really think the fathers have been ill u&s;ed. The ladies, though, I dare &s;ay, are well enough contented with the arrangement.</P>
<P>Although, as I have already apprized you, I do not mean to enter into a minute de&s;cription of towns, &s;o very ea&s;ily found in many volumes of geography and hi&s;tory, there occa&s;ionally occur cer|tain curio&s;ities in &s;ome of tho&s;e towns, which it would be unpardonable in me to pa&s;s over, as they

<P>Liege, the capital of the bi&s;hopric, is unque&s;ti|onably a beautiful city, of immen&s;e &s;ize: its opu|lence, its plea&s;antne&s;s, its plenty, and &s;alubrity, may be calculated from the name it has long been expre&s;sly called by way of eminence&mdash;<HI>the Paradi&s;e of Prie&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;Indeed, it mu&s;t needs be a holy and happy city; for it is chiefly occupied with con|vents, churches, and other religious foundations.</P>

<P>AIX-LA-CHAPELLE&mdash;The imperial city of Aix-la-Chapelle, by the Germans called Achen, lies at the di&s;tance of twenty-&s;ix miles, nearly ea&s;t, of Liege. As it was a moderate &s;tage, the weather fine, and the face of the country around beautiful, I found my journey extremely plea&s;ant, and entered that famous city in as good a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with it, as circum&s;tances and reflections &s;o melan|choly as mine (which, in &s;pite of every effort, would intrude them&s;elves) may be &s;uppo&s;ed to allow. It is certainly a very fine city, and well de&s;erves the reputation it has in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>Perhaps no city in Germany has a fairer claim to antiquity than Aix-la-Chapelle; for it was famous, even, in the time of the ancient Romans&punc; for its waters, and was by them called <HI>Aqua&s;granum,</HI> or <HI>Urbs Aqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;us.</HI> It was de&s;troyed by the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, who, like the French now, de&s;troyed and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpled under foot every ve&s;tige of refinement, wherever

they carried their conque&s;ts; and it lay in ruins till it was rebuilt by CHARLEMAGNE, who made it the &s;eat of his empire on this &s;ide of the Alps. By him it was ordained, the kings of the Romans &s;hould be crowned there: and it has been famous, &s;ince that time, for councils and treaties, particu|larly that famous one between France and Spain in 1663, and another lately between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P>Although there are many Prote&s;tants, both Lu|therans and Calvini&s;ts, in this city, they are obli|liged to go to church two miles off, at a place called Vaels, in the dutchy of Limburg; &s;o that Popery prevails with &s;ome portion of its intolerance. Here, as in all other places &s;ubject to its power, it has rai&s;ed the Gothic gloomy pile, accumulated enor|mous ma&s;&s;es of wealth, and hoarded up trea&s;ures, under the gulling pretexts of religious parapherna|lia: a golden ca&s;ket, &s;et with precious &s;tones of ine&s;timable value, is hoarded up, not for the actual value of the moveable, but as the only fit recepta|cle for a relique it contains&mdash;a curious one, too, even of its kind&mdash;a bit of earth!&mdash;A bit of earth? yes! a bit of earth, common earth!&mdash;only with this fortunate circum&s;tance in addition, that a drop of the blood of Saint STEPHEN fell, or is &s;aid to have fallen, upon it, as he was &s;toned to death! think of that, ma&s;ter FREDERICK! Why, when tho&s;e things occur to me, I feel my&s;elf agitated by a whim&s;ical tumult of &s;en&s;ations, &s;erious and ludi|crous, &s;orrowful and merry, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe&mdash;&s;omething like that &s;tate in which the &s;pirits flutter when a per&s;on whimpers between a laugh and cry. But, to carry the matter farther, when we recollect that &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and brighte&s;t of mankind, &s;ome of the brave&s;t warriors, &s;terne&s;t philo&s;ophers, and able&s;t &s;tate&s;men, that ever exi&s;ted, have been the dupes of tho&s;e &s;hallow artificers, and actually have knelt in devout homage

<P>We have already had, and are likely yet to have &s;uch a clum&s;y load of cathedrals to attend to, that I &s;hould not mention that of Aix-la-Chapelle (a large, gloomy, dreary, old-fa&s;hioned, Gothic pile), were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not that it carries along with it &s;ome matters worthy of notice. What think you, then, of an emperor, a pope, and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops, in one company? Oh! precious a&s;&s;em|blage! But where, I hear you a&s;k&mdash;where, in the name of GOD, collect the bi&s;hops? a pope and emperor are ea&s;ily had! My dear FREDERICK, three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops might ea&s;ily be picked up in Chri&s;tendom, and leave more behind, too, than would &s;erve any u&s;eful purpo&s;e to the world.&mdash;Yes, the Emperor CHARLEMAGNE, and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops, were pre&s;ent at the con&s;ecration of this cathedral by Pope LEO the Third. That emperor lies now in great &s;tate under the altar of the choir: Pope LEO rots in Rome; and for the bi&s;hops, they are gone, per|haps, as <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays, "to &s;top a beer barrel."&mdash;</P>

<L>Might &s;top a hole, to keep the wind away&punc;"</L></Q>
<P>From &s;uch a &s;plendid and opulent attendance at the con&s;ecration, one would naturally expect that this cathedral would have been, at the very outlet, enriched with co&s;tly and valuable trappings: but no&mdash;one image of that of Liege would purcha&s;e the whole. It &s;hould be recollected, however, that they were all, excepting the emperor, Churchmen &mdash;a cla&s;s, who&s;e charity, generally &s;peaking, has, like a ring, neither end nor beginning; or at lea&s;t

ends and begins in it&s;elf, where nobody can &s;ee it; or, according to the old proverb, begins at home.</P>
<P>To compen&s;ate, however, for tho&s;e worldly, worthle&s;s vanities, gold, &s;ilver, and jewels, his Holine&s;s, and their three hundred and &s;ixty-five Graces, pre&s;ented the cathedral with &s;ome exqui|&s;ite pieces of relique, of more ine&s;timable value, by their account, than the mines of Poto&s;i or Gol|conda: the fir&s;t, an old covering&mdash;it would be folly for me to &s;ay, whether gown, petticoat, or &s;hift&mdash; but they, that is to &s;ay, the prie&s;ts, &s;ay, and the faithful believe them, that it was the &s;hift worn by the Virgin MARY at the birth of CHRIST&mdash;how their Holine&s;&s;es came by it, is hard to conjecture: &mdash;in the next place, a piece of coar&s;e cloth, which, they al&s;o &s;ay, and are believed when they &s;ay, was girt about CHRIST on the cro&s;s: thirdly, a piece of cord, with which they &s;ay he was bound:&mdash; fourthly, &s;ome of the blood of Saint STEPHEN, now eighteen hundred years old;&mdash;and, fifthly, a picture of the Virgin and Child, embo&s;&s;ed on a j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;per, by Saint LUKE. With all due deference to their Reverences' knowledge, I &s;hould think a do|zen &s;tatues in gold of the apo&s;tles would be rather a more valuable gift, and more ornamental, than the&s;e rags and cords, which I dare &s;ay did not co&s;t altogether &s;ix pence. We talk here of our blue ribbons, our red ribbons, and our &s;tars as great do|nations; but I think the pre&s;ents of the Pope and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops to the cathe|dral of Aix-la-Chapelle, beat them out of the field, whether we con&s;ider the magnificence of the gift, or the genero&s;ity of the givers.</P>
<P>But that which, above all things, renders Aix-la-Chapelle worthy of notice, is the &s;alubrity of its waters, which bring from England, and all other European nations, a va&s;t concour&s;e of valetudina|rians, who contribute at once to the gaiety and opulence of the city and adjacent country. Some

of tho&s;e waters are u&s;ed for drinking, and others for bathing, re&s;embling very much, in their qua|lity, the virtues of tho&s;e of Bath in Somer&s;et&s;hire, but that &s;ome of them are &s;till hotter and &s;tronger: they are unplea&s;ant to the ta&s;te till u&s;e reconciles the palate to them, and mo&s;t of them have a very offen&s;ive &s;mell; but they are often powerful in effect, and give relief in a great variety of mala|dies; and they are rendered &s;till more palatable by the commodious neatne&s;s of the baths, the excel|lence of the accommodations, and the great plenty of provi&s;ions, which are at once good and rea&s;ona|ble in this city.</P>
<P>I &s;taid to &s;hort a time at Aix-la-Chapelle, that I could not, without the aid of &s;ome of the miracles wrought by the &s;aints of the Romi&s;h church, or Sir JOHN MANDEVILLE, acquire a &s;ufficient knowledge of the people, to attempt a de&s;cription of them, or their manners&mdash;but it and Spa are &s;o well known, that you cannot have much trouble in finding a de&s;cription of them already written.</P>
<P>As far as my ob&s;ervations enabled me to judge, there was nothing in the German character that had the power either to create intere&s;t, or excite great attention.&mdash;They are rather to be approved than admired; and, wanting tho&s;e prominent features that &s;o whim&s;ically chequer other nations with the extremes of bad and good, maje&s;tic and ridiculous, afford little &s;ubject to the traveller for the indul|gence of &s;entimental reflection, or to the philo&s;o+pher for the exerci&s;e of moral &s;peculation.</P>

<P>BIDDING adieu to the famous city of Aix-la-Chapelle, which, very untraveller-like, I pa&s;&s;ed without drinking of its waters. I pu&s;hed on, and &s;oon arrived at the city of Juliers, the capital of a dutchy of that name, &s;ixteen miles from Aix. The country it&s;elf is wonderfully fruitful, teeming with abundance of all &s;orts of corn, wood, pa&s;ture, woad, coal, and cattle; above all, a mo&s;t excellent breed of hor&s;es, of which great numbers are ex|ported.</P>
<P>As to the city, though a capital, there was no|thing in it that I thought worth attention&mdash;that of neatne&s;s is its greate&s;t prai&s;e. It is not, like Liege, overloaded with enormous church edifices; but, what is much better, the people are opulent, the poor well &s;upplied, and all happy. In all likeli|hood, this is owing to the inhabitants being a mix|ture of Prote&s;tant and Roman Catholic; for, by a treaty between the Elector Palatine and the Em|peror of Brandenburg, re&s;pecting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the territories of the Duke of Cleves, both the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts of this dutchy, and of Berg, are to enjoy the public exerci&s;e of their reli|gion, and all other religious rites.</P>
<P>If experience would allow us to wonder at any thing in the management of the rulers of nations, it mu&s;t &s;urely be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that in an article of &s;uch con&s;equence as eternity, and which mu&s;t be directed by private &s;entiments alone, &s;uch violence &s;hould &s;y&s;tematically be offered to opinion, and that mankind &s;hould be dragooned, as they have been for &s;o many weary centuries, into

the profe&s;&s;ion of particular modes of faith.

If it be objected that certain religious &s;ects are ho&s;tile to certain &s;tates, it may be an&s;wered, that they are &s;o becau&s;e the &s;tate is ho&s;tile to them.

Never, in my life, had I heard &s;uch an infernal clatter: never before had I &s;een any thing &s;o gloomy and melancholy&mdash;the &s;treets black&mdash;di&s;mal bells tolling&mdash;bald-pated friars, in myriads, trailing their long black forms through the &s;treets, moulding their faces into every &s;hape that art had enabled them to a&s;&s;ume, in order to excite commi&s;eration, and begging alms with a melancholy &s;ong calculated for the purpo&s;e, &s;omewhat like that
<PB N="99" REF="033487_0098_0FF722F8E4600EB8">
of our blind beggars in London, and productive of the &s;ame di&s;agreeable effect upon the &s;pirits. In &s;hort, I was not an hour in Cologne, when tho&s;e circum&s;tances, con&s;piring with the in&s;uperable melancholy of my mind, made me wi&s;h my&s;elf out of it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Cologne is a fine city; and if it be any &s;atisfaction to you to &s;pin tho&s;e fine imaginary ligaments that, in the brain of the book-worm, con|nect the ancient and modern world, I will inform you, that it was anciently called <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI> becau&s;e AGRIPPINA, the mother of NERO, was born there, and honored it with a Roman colony, becau&s;e it was her birth-place. The mind, forced back to that period, and contemplating the mi&s;|chiefs of that mon&s;ter NERO, cannot help wi&s;hing that Cologne had been burnt the nigth of her birth, and Mi&s;s AGRIPPINA buried in the ruins, ere &s;he had lived to give birth to that &s;courge of the world.</P>
<P>Although the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion here be the Roman Catholic, extraordinary as it may appear, they are very jealous of power; and though the elector, by his officers, admini&s;ters ju&s;tice in all criminal cau&s;es, they will not permit him, in per|&s;on, to re&s;ide above three days at a time in the city, nor to bring a great train with him when he vi&s;its it; for this rea&s;on he commonly re&s;ides at Bonne.</P>
<P>Cologne has a very con&s;iderable trade, particularly in Rheni&s;h wine; and its gin is reckoned the be&s;t in the world, and bears a higher price than any other in all the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>Like all great Roman Catholic cities, it has a profu&s;ion of churches, cro&s;&s;es, miracles, &s;aints, and church trinkets; and I really think it has more &s;teeples and bells than any two cities in Germany. As Liege was called the Paradi&s;e of Prie&s;ts, this ought to be called the Golgotha of Skulls and Skull-caps. In the church of Saint URSULA, they &s;hew, or pretend at lea&s;t to &s;hew, the bones of
<PB N="100" REF="033487_0099_0FF722FBC9E49F90">
eleven thou&s;and virgin martyrs. The &s;kulls of &s;ome of tho&s;e imaginary virgins are in &s;ilver ca&s;es, and others in &s;kull-caps, of cloth, of gold, and velvet. And in the church of Saint GERION, are no le&s;s than nine hundred heads of Moori&s;h cavaliers, of the army of the Emperor CONSTANTINE, (previ|ous to that &s;aint's conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity), who they &s;ay was beheaded for refu&s;ing to &s;acrifice to idols: by the bye, the Popi&s;h divines burn, in&s;tead of beheading, for not &s;acrificing to idols&mdash;Every one of tho&s;e heads, however, has a cap of &s;carlet, adorned with pearls. The whole forms a &s;pectacle no doubt equally agreeable and edifying. It &s;truck me, however, as an extremely ludicious &s;ight, mal|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;olemnity of &s;o many death's he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds: and when their &s;tory was recounted, I could not help internally chuckling, and &s;aying (rather punningly, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">). "Ah! what <HI>blockheads</HI> ye mu&s;t have been, to &s;uffer your&s;elves to be &s;eparated from your &s;nug warm bodies, rather than drop down and wor|&s;hip an idol, in which &s;o many good Chri&s;tian di|vines have &s;hewn you an example!" This, you will conclude, I &s;aid to my&s;elf: an avowal of my &s;entiments in that place might have given my head a title to a &s;carlet cap and pearls; and as I had &s;ome further u&s;e for it, I did not think it expedient to leave it behind me in the church of Saint GERION &mdash;&s;o, very prudently, kept my mind to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Coming out of the church, a multitude of beg|gars, all in canonicals, or &s;tudent's habits, &s;ur|rounded, be&s;eeching me for alms&mdash;one, pour l'amour de DIEU; another, pour l'amour de la Sainte Vierge; a third, pour le &s;alut de no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Redemp|teur; a fourth, pour l'amour de Saint GERION; and &s;o on!</P>
<P>When I had gone as far as I wi&s;hed in donations, another attacked me: though I told him my cha|rity-bank was exhau&s;ted, he per&s;evered, and was uncommonly &s;olicitous&mdash;till at length, having ex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="101" REF="033487_0100_0FF722FEF404ECD0">
the whole catalogue of &s;aints that are to be found in the calendar, he rai&s;ed his voice from the mi&s;erable whine of petition, and exclaimed with great energy, "Par les neuf cent tetes des Cavaliers Maures qui &s;ont &s;antifies au Ciel, je vous conjure de me faire l'aumone!" This was too formidable an appeal to be &s;lighted; and &s;o, in homage to the &s;kulls and red caps, I put my hand in my pocket, and &s;topped his clamours.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mi&s;erable modes of peculation are the mo&s;t pardonable of any produced by the church: we have no right to regret a trifle &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of compa&s;&s;ion, even when that compa&s;&s;ion is mi&s;taken; but our rea&s;on revolts at impo&s;ition, when it calls coercion to its aid, and a&s;&s;umes the name of right.</P>
<P>Without any national predilection, which you know I am above, I think our church affairs in Scotland are arranged upon a better &s;y&s;tem than any other that I know of: hence their clergy are in general examples worthy of imitation, for learning, piety, and moral conduct.</P>

<P>LABOURED inve&s;tigations to e&s;tabli&s;h connections between the hi&s;tory of the ancient and bu&s;ine&s;s of the modern world, and virulent di&s;putes about trifles of antiquity, &s;uch as in what year this place was built, or that great man was born, when and where JULIUS CAESAR landed in England, whether he pa&s;&s;ed this road or that, what route HANNIBAL took over the Alps. and &s;uch like, are &s;o e&s;&s;entially unintere&s;ting, u&s;ele&s;s, and unimpor|tant, &s;o unprofitable, and, one would think, &s;o
<PB N="102" REF="033487_0101_0FF72300CD984150">
painful too&punc; that it is wonderful how &s;o many men of great learning have been unwi&s;e enough to em|ploy their lives in the re&s;earch.</P>
<P>It does not follow, however, that when informa|tion that tends to recall to our minds the great men of antiquity is pre&s;ented to us, we &s;hould reject it. A man of cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te and education feels a delight in tho&s;e little memorials of what gave him plea&s;ure in his youth. I know a gentleman, who, being at Seville; in Spain, travelled to Cordova, for no other purpo&s;e but to &s;ee the town where LUCAN and SE|NECA were born: and I dare &s;ay, that if you were at Cologne, you would be much plea&s;ed to &s;ee the town-hou&s;e, a great Gothic building, which, con|tains a variety of ancient in&s;criptions; the fir&s;t to commemorate the kindne&s;s of JULIUS CAESAR to the Ubii, who inhabited this place, and of whom you have found mention made by him in his Com|mentaries, and al&s;o his building two wooden bridges over the Rhine: a &s;econd commemorates AUGUS|TUS &s;ending a colony here. There is al&s;o a cro&s;s-bow of whalebone, twelve feet long, eight broad, and four inches thick, which they who &s;peak of it conjecture to have belonged to the Emperor MAXI|MIN. There are al&s;o &s;ome Roman in&s;criptions in the ar&s;enal, the import of which I now forget.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary, but certainly a fact, that there are, about Cologne, families yet exi&s;ting, who indulge the &s;en&s;ele&s;s ambition of pretending to be de&s;cended from the ancient Romans, and who actu|ally produce their genealogies, carried down from the fir&s;t time this city was made a colony of the Roman empire. Of all kinds of vanity, this is perhaps the mo&s;t extravagant; for, if antiquity merely be the object, all are equally high, &s;ince all mu&s;t have originated from the &s;ame &s;tock; and if it be the pride of belonging to a particular family who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for valour or virtue, a claim which often only &s;erves to prove the degeneracy of
<PB N="103" REF="033487_0102_0FF72303956BD748">
the claimant, it could not apply in the ca&s;e of a whole people: but this is among the frailties of humanity; and we are often &s;o dazzled with the &s;plendour of terre&s;trial glory, that we endeavour to be allied to it even by the mo&s;t remote and ridicu|lous connections. I heard of a man, who&s;e pride and boa&s;t, when drunk, was, that Dean SWIFT had once thrown his mother's oy&s;ters (&s;he was an oy&s;ter-wench) about the &s;treet, and then gave her half a crown as an atonement for the injury. On the &s;trength of this affinity did he call the Dean nothing but <HI>Cou&s;in Jonathan,</HI> though the Dean was dead before he was born!</P>
<P>But of all the &s;tories I have ever heard as illu|&s;trative of this &s;trange ambition, that which the late Lord ANSON has left us is the mo&s;t &s;triking. When that great man was travelling in the Ea&s;t&punc; he hired a ve&s;&s;el to vi&s;it the i&s;land of Tenedos&punc; his pilot, a modern Greek, pointing to a bay as they &s;ailed along, exclaimed in great triumph, "There, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, there it was that our fleet lay."&mdash;"What fleet?" interrogated ANSON&mdash;"Why, our Grecian fleet, at the &s;iege of Troy," returned the pilot.</P>
<P>While tho&s;e doughty de&s;cendants of the ancient Romans indulge the cheerle&s;s idea of their great and illu&s;trious line of ancient ance&s;try, the prince who rules them felicitates him&s;elf with the more &s;ub&s;tantial dignities and emoluments of his modern offices. As elector and archbi&s;hop of Cologne, he has dominion over a large, fruitful, and opulent country: he is the mo&s;t powerful of the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal electors: he has many &s;uffragan princes, lay and &s;piritual, under him: and he is archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. The revenues of his archbi&s;hopric amount annually to one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds Sterling; and as elector, he is po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed of &s;everal other great benefices. I pre|&s;ume, becau&s;e he is a prince, that he is a man of &s;en&s;e; and, I will venture to &s;ay, that, as &s;uch, he
<PB N="104" REF="033487_0103_0FF7230A3599E0C8">
would not barter tho&s;e good things for the power to demon&s;trate that LUCRETIA was his aunt, BRU|TUS his grandfather, and the great JULIUS CAESAR him&s;elf his cou&s;in-german.</P>
<P>CHRIST cho&s;e his di&s;ciples out of fi&s;hermen. The Chapter of Cologne is, perhaps, on the contrary, the very mo&s;t ari&s;tocratic body exi&s;ting, being com|po&s;ed of forty canons, who are princes or counts of the empire&mdash;Of tho&s;e, twenty-five choo&s;e the archbi&s;hop, and many advance one of their own body to that great and wealthy dignity, if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From Cologne I proceeded to the town of Bonne, which is &s;aid to take its name from the plea&s;antne&s;s of its &s;ituation. Here the elector re&s;ides, and has a very fine palace. The country around is extremely fruitful and plea&s;ant, and is ble&s;&s;ed with mo&s;t of the good things which render the rich magnificent and happy, and remind the poor of their inferiority and wretchedne&s;s&mdash;particularly wine, which is here re|markably excellent. It contains churches, prie&s;ts, convents, cloi&s;ters, &amp;c.; but I need not mention them&mdash;what place could exi&s;t without them?</P>
<P>I &s;hould not forget to tell you, that, at this place, JULIUS CAESAR built one of his bridges acro&s;s the Rhine&mdash;works which would have handed down to po&s;terity the name of a common man, for the mag|nitude of the &s;tructure and ingenuity of the contri|vance, but are lo&s;t in the crowd of a&s;toni&s;hing talents which di&s;tingui&s;hed that brighte&s;t of morals. The greate&s;t biographer of antiquity &s;ays of him, that he was as great a general as HANNIBAL, as great an orator as CICERO, and as great a politician as AU|GUSTUS; but it might be added, that he was among the fir&s;t poets of his day&mdash;that he was of the fir&s;t mechanical genius, and the fine&s;t gentleman, in Rome.</P>
<P>Nature &s;eems to have formed, in CAESAR, a com|pendious union of all human talents, as if to de|mon&s;trate

how unavailing they were when oppo&s;ed to &s;trict rigid hone&s;ty and virtue in the character of BRUTUS.</P>
<P>To go from Bonne to Frankfort, there are two ways&mdash;one over the mountains of Wetterania, the other up the river Rhine. I made no he&s;itation to adopt the latter, and was rewarded for my choice with the view of as &s;ine a country, inhabited by as fine a race of people, as I had ever &s;een. Valleys filled with herds, plains enamelled with corn-fields, and the hills covered with vineyards, regaled the eye, and conveyed to the mind all the felicitating ideas of plenty, natural opulence, and true pro&s;pe|rity. My anxiety, however, to get forward, and di&s;engage my&s;elf from a &s;pecies of &s;olitude in a country where, though travelling is cheap, accom|modations of mo&s;t kinds in the public hou&s;es are bad, induced me to pu&s;h on, without taking the time nece&s;&s;ary for making accurate ob&s;ervations on the country as I pa&s;&s;ed; &s;o that, gliding, as it were, imperceptibly, through a number of towns, of which I recollect nothing di&s;tinctly but the names of Coblentz and Mentz, I arrived at the great, free, and imperial city of Frankfort on the Maine.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall &s;top, for a &s;hort time, my relation, in order to give you time for ju&s;t reflection and ex|amination of what I have already written: and as, in the latter part of it, I have &s;kimmed very lightly over the country, I de&s;ire that you will &s;upply the deficiency of my information by clo&s;e re&s;earch in books; inform your&s;elf of the great outlines of the Germanic Con&s;titution; look back to its origin, its progre&s;s, and its e&s;tabli&s;hment; thence proceed to the di&s;trict parts, or inferior &s;tates, of which it is compo&s;ed; ponder them all well; and from tho&s;e draw your own inferences, and let me hear what they are with freedom: &s;hould they be wrong, I will endeavour to &s;et them right; but &s;hould they be right, they will afford me the mo&s;t lively &s;atis|faction;

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE country about Frankfort is delight|ful, rich and fruitful, and watered by the beautiful river Maine, which divides the city into two parts, that on the north being called Frankfort, and that on the &s;outh, Saxenhau&s;en, from the Saxons, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the founders of it. The city it&s;elf is large, populous, and rich, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for being the place where the emperor and king of the Romans is elected&mdash;though, by the ap|pointment of CHARLEMAGNE, Cologne has a &s;upe|rior claim to that honor. The magi&s;trates, and great part of the inhabitants, are Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts; notwith&s;tanding which, mo&s;t of the churches are in the hands of the Roman Catholics&mdash;a laudable in|&s;tance of the true tolerant &s;pirit of a wi&s;e and virtu|ous in&s;titution, and a heavy reflection upon, as well as a noble example to the Popi&s;h Powers of Europe.</P>
<P>The territory belonging to Frankfort is of very con&s;iderable extent; and the trade carried on through it, by means of the rivers Rhine and Maine, of very great importance, not only to the country it&s;elf, but to other commercial nations, and particularly to Great Britain, who&s;e manufactures
<PB N="107" REF="033487_0106_0FF723101A069CE8">
are &s;ent to Frankfort, and thence circulated through the Continent. in amazing quantities.</P>
<P>The fairs of Frankfort are talked of all over Eu|rope &mdash;of &s;uch importance are they in the world of commerce. They are held, one at Ea&s;ter, and ano|ther in September, and continue for three weeks, during which time the re&s;ort of people there from all quarters is a&s;toni&s;hing. Every thing is done by the government to render them as attractive to mer|chants as po&s;&s;ible; and taxes or duties are extremely low&mdash;a bale of the value of ten or twenty thou&s;and crowns paying duty only about ten or eleven pence of our money. All commodities from all parts of the world are &s;old there, and circulated through the empire; but, particularly, books are &s;old in prodi|gious quantities. After the fairs are over, the &s;hops of the foreign merchants are &s;hut up, and their names written over their doors.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the great importance the&s;e fairs are to commerce, I need only mention, that in the pre&s;ent war, the impediments thrown by the French in the way of the tran&s;it of goods up the Rhine, and the &s;hutting up that fair, gave a mo&s;t alarming paraly&s;is to the manufacturing e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of England, and a &s;hock to public credit in con&s;equence, that would, but for the timely inter|ference of Parliament, have, in all probability, been fatal to the national credit.</P>
<P>Frankfort is in many re&s;pects a plea&s;ant place: the merchants are extremely convivial and &s;ociable, and form clubs, where they meet to drink tea and coffee, and play at cards. There is a playhou&s;e al&s;o, a great number of coffee-hou&s;es, and other hou&s;es of entertainment in abundance. The coun|try around is covered with woods and vineyards, and the circumjacent villages are very plea&s;ant, and well &s;upplied with hou&s;es of entertainment, to which the inhabitants of the city re&s;ort in the
<PB N="108" REF="033487_0107_0FF72315236EE470">
Summer &s;ea&s;on: and the inns in Frankfort are excellent.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular cu&s;tom prevails here, which I think worth mentioning: Taverns are denoted by pine|trees planted before the doors of them; and the different prices of the wines in their cellars are marked in ciphers on the door-po&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the town here is pre&s;ented the original Gol|den Bull, or Pope's Authority, which contains the rules and orders to be ob&s;erved at the election of the Emperors. The Golden Bull is never &s;hown to &s;trangers but in the pre&s;ence of two of the coun|cil and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecretary&mdash;It is a little manu&s;cript in q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-two leaves of parch|ment, with a gold &s;eal of three inches diameter, of the value of twenty ducats, hung to it by a cord of yellow &s;ilk. It is &s;aid to be written in Latin and Gothic characters, without diphthongs; and kept in a black box together with two written tran&s;la|tions of it into the German language.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of Frankfort, that the Roman Catholics po&s;&s;e&s;s the churches, the Lutherans the dignities, and the Calvini&s;ts the riches. It is therefore one of the few places in Chri&s;tendom where the churches and the riches do not go into the &s;ame hands.</P>
<P>From Frankfort to Aug&s;burgh, I pa&s;&s;ed through a number of towns, all of them &s;o very incon&s;ider|able as not to merit any particular de&s;cription. The way lies from the Palatinate though the Circle of Suabia. In the extreme end of the Palatinate, and immediately before entering the Dutchy of Wir|temberg, the country is covered with fir-trees, and money is &s;o &s;carce in it, that a loaf of wheaten bread, weighing eight pounds, co&s;ts but two pence.</P>
<P>This city of Aug&s;burgh is the capital of a bi&s;h|opric of that name in the Circle of Suabia, and is worthy of the attention of the cla&s;&s;ical traveller for its antiquity. About twelve years before the birth

of CHRIST, AUGUSTUS CAESAR &s;ubdued all this country, and, on the place where Aug&s;burgh now &s;tands, formed a colony, gave the town the name of Augu&s;ta Vindelicorum, and put it under the government of DRUSUS the brother of TIBERIUS, afterwards emperor of Rome. The inhabitants of this place were the Vindelici, a branch of the Illyrians. But, ancient though it be, it has little more of antiquity to entitle it to notice than the bare name; for it has been pillaged &s;o often, par|ticularly by that mon&s;ter ATTILA, that there are &s;carcely any remains of its antiquity to be found.</P>
<P>Aug&s;burgh, is now, however a hand&s;ome city&mdash; the public buildings in general magnificent, and adorned with fountains, water engines of a curious con&s;truction, and &s;tatues.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t rich and &s;plendid part of the town belongs to a family of the name of FUGGERS (ori|ginaly de&s;cended from a weaver), who enriched them&s;elves by commerce, and one of whom render|ed not only him&s;elf, but the whole family, con&s;pi|cuous, by entertaining the emperor CHARLES the Fifth in a &s;uperb manner, and &s;upplying him with money, and then throwing his bond into the fire; in return for which, the emperor, made him a count of the empire.</P>
<P>This city is remarkable for gold&s;miths' ware; and its mechanics are equal to any in the world, for works in gold, ivory, clocks, and time-pieces; and they engrave better than any people in Germany, which brings them con&s;iderable profits. But what they are, above all other people, eminent for, is the manufacturing &s;teel-chains &s;o prodigiou&s;ly fine, that when one of them, of a &s;pan in length, has been put about the neck of a flea, it lifts up the whole of it as it leaps; and yet tho&s;e are &s;old for le&s;s than a &s;hilling of our money a piece.</P>

Chri&s;tianity, di&s;graced the human under&s;tanding, and defaced &s;ociety, impo&s;es upon the liberal, well-thinking traveller, the office of &s;atiri&s;t but too often. Aug&s;burgh, however, is a &s;plendid ex|ception, and holds up a mo&s;t glorious &s;pectacle of manly &s;en&s;e, generous &s;entiment, ju&s;tice, and I will &s;ay policy too, vanqui&s;hing that &s;hark-jawed enemy of mankind, bigotry. The magi&s;tracy of Aug&s;|burgh is compo&s;ed of about an equal number of Prote&s;tants and Roman Catholics&mdash;their &s;enate con|&s;i&s;ting of twenty-three Roman Catholics and twenty-two Lutherans, and their common Council of a hundred and fifty of each: The executive power is lodged in the &s;enate&mdash;the legi&s;lative authority in both bodies. But, what is hardly to be found any where, they all, as well as the people, agree toge|ther in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, notwith&s;tanding the difference of religion; and at all tables but the communion table, they a&s;&s;ociate together, dip in the &s;ame di&s;h, and drink of the &s;ame cup, as if they had never heard of the odious di&s;tinction of Papi&s;t and Prote&s;tant, but as being bound to each other by the great and irrefragable bond of humanity: fellow-creatures, affected by the &s;ame feelings, impelled by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, labouring under the &s;ame nece&s;|&s;ities, and heirs to the &s;ame &s;ufferings, their means of a&s;&s;uaging the one, gratifying or re&s;i&s;ting another, and &s;upplying the third, are the &s;ame, though che|quered and varied a little in the mode&mdash;the road alone different, the ends alike. Is it not cruel, then&mdash;is it not intolerable, that the calamities in&s;e|parable from humanity &s;hould be aggravated with artificial &s;tings, and the nakedne&s;s of human nature expo&s;ed, and rendered more offen&s;ive, by factitious calamities of human contrivance?

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the rea&s;ons mentioned in my la&s;t, Aug&s;burgh is a mo&s;t agreeable place to live in. Touched with the &s;en&s;ations natural to a man who loved to &s;ee his fellow-creatures happy, my heart expanded to a &s;y&s;tem of peace and harmony, com|prehending the whole globe: my mind expatiated involuntarily on the ble&s;&s;ings and advantages deriv|ed from &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem; and, taking flight from the bounds of practicability, to which our feeble nature is pinned on this earth, into the regions or fancy, had reared a fabric of Utopian mold, which, I ve|rily believe, exceeded in extravagance the works of all the Utopian architects that ever con&s;tructed ca&s;tles in the air.</P>
<P>Hurried on by this delightful vi&s;ion, my per&s;on paid an involuntary obedience to my mind; and the quickne&s;s of my pace increa&s;ing with the im|petuo&s;ity of my thoughts, I found my&s;elf, before I was aware of it, within the chapel-door of the convent of the Carmelites. Ob&s;erving my error, I &s;uddenly turned about, in order to depart, when a friar, a goodly per&s;on of a man, elderly, and of a benign a&s;pect, called me, and, advancing towards me, a&s;ked, in terms of politene&s;s, and in the French language, why I was retreating &s;o abruptly&mdash;I was confu&s;ed: but truth is the enemy before whom confu&s;ion ever flies; and I told him the whole of my mi&s;take, and the thoughts from which they aro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="033487_0111_0FF7231FB539FDE8">The good father, waving further di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, but with a &s;mile which I thought carried a mixture of benevolence for my&s;elf, and contempt for my ideas, brought me through the church, and &s;hewed me all the curio&s;ities of the place, and par|ticularly pointed out to me, as a great curio&s;ity, a &s;un-dial made in the form of a Madonna, the head enriched with rays and &s;tars, and in the hand a &s;ceptre which marked the hours.</P>
<P>Quitting the chapel, and going towards the re|fectory, the friar &s;tood, and, looking at me with a &s;mile of gaiety, &s;aid, "I have yet &s;omething to &s;hew you, which, while lady Madonna marks the time, will help us to pa&s;s it; and, as it will make its way with more force and &s;ubtlety to your &s;en&s;es than tho&s;e I have yet &s;hewn you, will be likely to be longer retained in remembrance."</P>
<P>He &s;poke a few words in German, which of cour&s;e I did not under&s;tand, to a vi&s;ion bearing the &s;hape of a human creature, who, I under&s;tood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lay-brother; and, turning down a long alley, brought me to his cell, where we were &s;oon fol|lowed by the afore&s;aid lay-brother, with a large earthen jug of liquor, two gla&s;&s;es, and a plate with &s;ome delicately white bi&s;cuit.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid the friar, "that the convent of Carmelites at Aug&s;burgh has for ages been famed for beer unequalled in any part of the world; and I have brought you here to have your opinion&mdash;for, being an Engli&s;hman, you mu&s;t be a judge, the Britons being famed for luxury, and a perfect knowledge of the <HI>&s;cavoir vivre."</HI> He pour|ed out, and drank to me: it looked liker the clear|e&s;t Champaigne than beer&mdash;I never ta&s;ted any thing to equal it; and he &s;eemed highly gratified by my expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e, which I lavi&s;hed upon it, as well from politene&s;s, as regard to truth.</P>
<P>After we had drank a gla&s;s each, "I have been reflecting," &s;aid the friar, "on the &s;ingular flight
<PB N="113" REF="033487_0112_0FF7232146A727D0">
of fancy that directed your &s;teps into this convent&mdash; Your mind was di&s;ea&s;ed, my &s;on! and a propitious &s;uperintending Power has guided your &s;teps to a phy&s;ician, if you will but have the goodne&s;s to take the medicine he offers."</P>
<P>I &s;tared with vi&s;ible marks of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"You are &s;urpri&s;ed," continued he; "but you &s;hall hear! When fir&s;t you di&s;clo&s;ed to me tho&s;e &s;ickly flights of your mind, I could on the in&s;tant have an&s;wered them: but you are young&mdash;you are an Engli&s;hman&mdash;two characters impatient of re|proof: the dogmas of a prie&s;t, I thought there|fore, would be &s;ufficiently difficult to be dige&s;ted of them&s;elves, without any additional di&s;ta&s;te caught from the chilling au&s;terity of a chapel!"</P>
<P>I looked unintentionally at the earthen jug, and &s;miled.</P>
<P>"It is very true," &s;aid he, catching my very in|mo&s;t thoughts from the expre&s;&s;ion of my counte|nance &mdash;"it is very true! good doctrine may, at certain times, and with certain per&s;ons, be more effectually enforced under the cheering influence of the &s;ocial board, than by the authoritative declama|tion and formal &s;anctity of the pulpit; nor am I, though a Carmelite, one of tho&s;e who pretend to think, that a thing in it&s;elf good, can be made bad by decent hilarity, and the animation produced by a moderate and wi&s;e u&s;e of the goods of this earth."</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;</P>
<P>"You fell into a reverie," continued he, "pro|duced by a contemplation of the happine&s;s of a &s;ociety exi&s;ting without any difference, and where no human breath &s;hould be wa&s;ted on a &s;igh, no ear tortured with a groan, no tears to trickle, no griefs or calamities to wring the heart."</P>
<P>"Yes, father!" &s;aid I, catching the idea with my former enthu&s;ia&s;m; "that would be my wi&s;h&mdash; that my greate&s;t, fir&s;t de&s;ire."</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="033487_0113_0FF72322DF25FFC0">"Then &s;ee&s;t thou," interrupted he, "the ex|tent of thy wi&s;h, &s;uppo&s;e you could realize it, which, thank GOD! you cannot."</P>
<P>"What! thank GOD that I cannot? are the&s;e your thoughts?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my &s;on; and ere Madonna marks the progre&s;s of ten minutes with her &s;ceptre, they will be your's too."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Hear me, my &s;on!&mdash;Is not death a horrible precipice to the view of human creatures?"</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;uredly," &s;aid I&mdash;"the mo&s;t horrible: hu|man laws declare that, by re&s;orting to it for puni&s;h|ment, as the ultimatum of all terrible inflictions."</P>
<P>"When, then," &s;aid he, "covered as we are with mi&s;ery, to leave this world is &s;o in&s;upportable to the human reflection, what mu&s;t it be if we had nothing but joy and felicity to ta&s;te of in this life? Mark me, child!" &s;aid he, with an animated zeal that gave an expre&s;&s;ion to his countenance beyond any thing I had ever &s;een: "the mi&s;eries, the cala|mities, the heart-rendings, and the tears, which are &s;o intimately interwoven by the great arti&s;t in our natures as not to be &s;eparated in a &s;ingle in|&s;tance, are in the fir&s;t place our &s;ecurity of a future &s;tate, and in the next place &s;erve to &s;lope the way before us, and, by gradual operation, fit our minds for viewing, with &s;ome &s;ort of fortitude, that hi|deous cha&s;m that lies between us and that &s;tate&mdash; death. View tho&s;e mi&s;eries, then, as &s;pecial acts of mercy and commi&s;eration of a beneficent Crea|tor, who, with every calamity, melts away a link of that earthly chain that fetters our wi&s;hes to this di&s;mal world. Accept his ble&s;&s;ings and his goods, when he &s;ends them, with gratitude and enjoyment: receive his afflictions, too, with as joyous accept|ance, and as hearty gratitude. Thus, and not other|wi&s;e, you will realize all your Utopian flights of de&s;ire, by turning every thing to matter of comfort,
<PB N="115" REF="033487_0114_0FF72325DC6827E0">
and living contented with di&s;pen&s;ations which you cannot alter, and, if you could, would mo&s;t cer|tainly alter for the wor&s;e."</P>
<P>I &s;at ab&s;orbed in reflection&mdash;The friar, after &s;ome pau&s;e proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>"Errors ari&s;ing from virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and the love of our fellow creatures, take their com|plexion from their parent motives, and are virtu|ous. Your wi&s;hes, therefore, my &s;on! though er|roneous, merit reward, and, I tru&s;t will receive it from that Being who &s;ees the rece&s;&s;es of the heart; and if the truths I have told you have not failed to make their way to your under&s;tanding, let your adventure of to-day impre&s;s this undeniable maxim on your mind&mdash;&s;o limited is man, &s;o imperfect in his nature, that the extent of his virtue borders on vice, and the extent of his wi&s;dom on error."</P>
<P>I thought he was in&s;pired; and, ju&s;t as he got to the la&s;t period, every organ of mine was opened to take in his words.</P>
<P>"'Tis well, my &s;on!" &s;aid he&mdash;"I perceive you like my doctrine: then" changing his manner of &s;peaking, his expre&s;&s;ive countenance the whole time almo&s;t anticipating his whole words, "take &s;ome more of it," &s;aid he gaily, pouring out a fre&s;h gla&s;s. I pleaded the fear of inebriety&mdash;"Fear not," &s;aid he; "the beer of this convent never hurts the in|tellect."</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation continued till near dinner-time; for I was &s;o delighted, I &s;carcely knew how to &s;natch my&s;elf away: &s;uch a happy melange of piety and plea&s;antry, grave wi&s;dom and humour, I had never met. At length, the convent-bell tolling. I ro&s;e: he took me by the hand, and, in a tone of the mo&s;t complacent admonition, &s;aid, "Remember, my child! as long as you live, remember the convent of the Carmelites; and in the innumerable evils that certainly await you if you are to live long, the words you have heard from old Friar AUGUSTINE will afford you comfort."</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="033487_0115_0FF7232A93987AC0">"Father!" returned I, "be a&s;&s;ured I carry away from you a token that will never &s;uffer me to forget the ho&s;pitality&punc; the advice, or the politene&s;s of the good father AUGUSTINE. Poor as I am in natural means, I can make no other return than my good wi&s;hes, nor leave any impre&s;&s;ion behind me: but as my e&s;teem for you, and perhaps my vanity&punc; make me wi&s;h not to be forgotten, accept this, (a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, with a device in hair, which I happened to have on my finger); and whenever you look at it, let it re|mind you of one of tho&s;e, I dare &s;ay innumerable, in&s;tances, in which you have contributed to the happine&s;s and improvement of your fellow-crea|tures."</P>
<P>The good old man was affected, took the ring, and attended me to the convent gate, pronouncing many ble&s;&s;ings, and charging me to make Aug&s;burgh my way back again to England if po&s;&s;ible, and take one gla&s;s more of the convent ale.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING Aug&s;burgh, I travelled thro' Bavaria a long way before I reached the Tyrol Country, of the natural beauty of which I had heard much. and which I therefore entered with great expectations of that &s;ublime gratification the beau|ties of nature never fail to afford me. I was not di&s;appointed; indeed, my warme&s;t expectations were exceeded.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes a traveller from Bava|ria, on entering it, is the fort of Cherink, built be|tween two inacce&s;&s;ible rocks which &s;eparate Tyrol from the bi&s;hopric of Frei&s;ingen. So amply has nature provided for the &s;ecurity of this country
<PB N="117" REF="033487_0116_0FF7232C53F1ED30">
again&s;t the incur&s;ion of an enemy, that there is not a pa&s;s which leads to it that is not through &s;ome narrow defile between mountains almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;i|ble; and on the rocks and brows of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es, the emperor has con&s;tructed forts and citadels, &s;o advantageou&s;ly placed, that they command all the valleys and avenues beneath.</P>
<P>After a variety of windings and turnings through mountains of &s;tupendous height and awful a&s;pect, I began to de&s;cend, and entered the mo&s;t delightful valley I had ever beheld&mdash;deep, long, and above a mile in breadth&mdash;&s;urrounded with enormous piles of mountains, and diver&s;ified with the alternate beauties of nature and cultivation, &s;o as to form an union rarely to be met with, and delight at once the eye of the farmer, and the fancy of him that has a true ta&s;te for rural wildne&s;s. From the heights in de&s;cending, the whole appeared in all its glory; the beautiful river Inn gliding along through it longitudinally, its banks &s;tudded with the mo&s;t ro|mantic little villages, while a number of inferior &s;treams were &s;een winding in different cour&s;es, and ha&s;tening to pour their tribute into its bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Here I felt my heart overwhelmed with &s;en&s;ations of tran&s;port, which all the works of art could never in&s;pire: here nature ru&s;hed irre&s;i&s;tibly upon my &s;en&s;es, and, making them captive, exacted their ac|knowledgement of her &s;upremacy: here vanity, ambition, lu&s;t of fame and power, and all the tin|&s;elled, gaudy frippery to which habit and worldly cu&s;tom en&s;lave the mind, retired, to make way for &s;entiments of harmony, purity, &s;implicity, and truth: here Providence &s;eemed to &s;peak in language mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive, "Come &s;illy man, leave the wild tumult, the endle&s;s &s;truggle, the glittering follies, the fal&s;e and &s;purious plea&s;ures which artifice creates, to &s;e|duce you from the true&mdash;dwell here, and in the lap of natute &s;tudy me:" Here, oh! here, exclaimed I, in a tran&s;port which bereft me, for the time, of
<PB N="118" REF="033487_0117_0FF7232DE84C5860">
every other con&s;ideration, here will I dwell for ever. The charm was too finely &s;pun, to with&s;tand the hard tugs of fact; and all its precious delu&s;ions va|ni&s;hed before a ho&s;t of gloomy truths&mdash;deranged affairs&mdash;family far off, with the di&s;tance daily increa|&s;ing &mdash;the hazards and the hard&s;hips of a long untried journey&mdash;and the Ea&s;t Indies, with all its horrors, in the rear. I hung my head in &s;orrow; and, of|fering up a prayer to protect my family, &s;trengthen my&s;elf, and bring us once more together in &s;ome &s;pot heavenly as that I pa&s;&s;ed through, was pro|ceeding on in a &s;tate of dejection proportionate to my previous tran&s;ports, when I was rouled by my po&s;tillion, who, pointing to a very high, &s;teep rock, de&s;ired me to take notice of it. I did &s;o; but &s;eeing nothing very remarkable in its appear|ance, a&s;ked him what he meant by directing my at|tention to it&mdash;He an&s;wered me in the following manner, which, from the &s;ingularity of the narra|tive, and his &s;trange mode of telling it, I think it would injure to take out of his own words: I will, therefore, endeavour, as well as I can, to give you a literal tran&s;lation of it; and, indeed, the im|pre&s;&s;ion it made on my memory was &s;uch, that, I apprehend, I &s;hall not materially differ from his words:</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, Sir, (for every one in the world knows it), that all the&s;e mountains around us, are the abodes of good and evil &s;pirits, or genii&mdash; the latter of whom are continually doing every ma|licious thing they can devi&s;e, to injure the people of the country,&mdash;&s;uch as leading them a&s;tray&mdash; &s;mothering them in the &s;now&mdash;killing the cattle by throwing them down precipices&mdash;nay, when they can do no wor&s;e, drying up the milk in the udders of the goats&mdash;and, &s;ometimes, putting between young men and their &s;weet-hearts, and &s;topping their marriage. Ten thou&s;and cur&s;es light upon them! I &s;hould have been married two years ago,
<PB N="119" REF="033487_0118_0FF72332DB43F718">
and had two children to-day, but for their &s;chemes. In &s;hort, Sir, if it were not for the others&mdash;the good ones&mdash;who are always employed (and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin knows they have enough on their hands) in preventing the mi&s;chiefs of tho&s;e devils, the whole place would be de&s;troyed, and the coun|try left without a living thing&punc; man or goat!"</P>
<P>Here I could not, for the life of me, retain my gravity any longer, but bur&s;t, in &s;pite of me, into an immoderate fit of laughter, which &s;o di&s;concert|ed and offended him, that he &s;ullenly refu&s;ed to proceed with the &s;tory and farther, but continued marking his forehead (his hat off) with a thou&s;and cro&s;&s;es, uttering pious ejaculations. looking at me with a mixture of terror, di&s;tru&s;t, and admiration and every now and then glancing his eye a&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce toward the hills, as if fearful of a de&s;cent from the evil &s;pirits.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity was awakened by the very extraor|dinary commencement of his narrative; and I de|termined, if po&s;&s;ible, to hear it out: &s;o, a&s;&s;uring him that I meant nothing either of &s;light or wick|ne&s;s by my laughter&mdash;that I had too &s;erious ideas of &s;uch things to treat them with levity&mdash;and&punc; what was more convincing logic with him, promi&s;ing to reward him for it&mdash;he proceeded with his &s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>"Well, Sir, you &s;ay you were not &s;porting with tho&s;e &s;pirits&mdash;and fortunate it is for you: at all events, Saint JOHN of GOD be our guide, and bring us &s;afe to Inn&s;pruck. Ju&s;t &s;o the great MAXIMILIAN was wont to laugh at them; and you &s;hall hear how he was puni&s;hed for it&mdash;and that was the &s;tory I was about to tell you. The Emperor MAXIMILIAN, that glory of the world, (he is now in the lap of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin in Pa|radi&s;e), once on a time, before he was emperor, that is to &s;ay, when he was archduke, was al|ways laughing at the country people's fears of

tho&s;e &s;pirits&mdash;and an old father of the church forewarned him to beware, le&s;t he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ffer for his ra&s;hne&s;s: &s;o one day he went out hunting, and at the foot of that mountain a mo&s;t beautiful chamois &s;tarted before him; he &s;hot at it, and mi&s;&s;ed it&mdash;(the fir&s;t &s;hot he had mi&s;&s;ed for ma|ny years, which you know was warning enough to him)&mdash;however, he followed, &s;hooting at and mi&s;&s;ing it, the animal &s;tanding every now and then till he came up within &s;hot of it: thus he continued till near night, when the goat di&s;appeared of a &s;udden, and he found him&s;elf buried, as it were in the bowels of the mountain: he endeavoured to find his way out, but in vain; every &s;tep he took led him more a&s;tray, and he was for two days wandering about, CHRIST &s;ave us! in the frightful hollows of tho&s;e mountains, living all the time on wild berries: on the &s;econd night be bethought him&s;elf of his want of faith, and of the &s;aying of old Father JEROME: and he fell on his knees, and wept and prayed all night; and the Virgin heard his prayers, he being a good man, and, above all, an emperor&mdash;GOD ble&s;s you and me! we &s;hould have peri&s;hed&mdash;In the morning a beautiful young man, dre&s;&s;ed in a pea&s;ant's habit, came up to him, gave him victuals and wine, and de&s;ired him to follow him, which he did, you may be &s;ure, joyfully&mdash;but, Oh ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! think what his &s;urp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e mu&s;t have been, when, getting again into the plain out of the mountain, the young man di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ppeared and vani&s;hed all of a &s;ud|den, ju&s;t at the foot of that &s;teep rock which I &s;hewed you, and which ever &s;ince goes by the name of the emperor's rock&mdash;You &s;ee what a dan|gerous place it is, and what dangerous &s;pirits they mu&s;t be that would not &s;pare even the holy Roman emperor. In my mind, the be&s;t way is to &s;ay no|thing again&s;t tho&s;e things, as &s;ome faithle&s;s people do, and to wor&s;hip the Virgin and keep a good con|&s;cience, and then one will have the le&s;s to fear."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="033487_0120_0FF7233629B4A2C0">By the time he had ended his narrative, we were in &s;ight of Inn&s;pruck, when I annoyed and terri|fied him afre&s;h, by laughing immoderately at the end of his &s;tory&mdash;but atoned in &s;ome mea&s;ure for it, by giving him half a florin.</P>
<P>On inquiring at Inn&s;pruck, I found that MAXI|MILIAN had actually lo&s;t his way in the mountain, and had been conducted out of it by a pea&s;ant, who left him &s;uddenly; the re&s;t was an exaggerated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ditionary tale, ari&s;ing from the &s;uper&s;titious fears of the country people.</P>

<P>IN all nations under Heaven, and at all times &s;ince the creation there have been men form|ed to make a noi&s;e in the world&mdash;to increa&s;e or impede, to direct or di&s;turb, the calm, &s;ober pro|gre&s;s of &s;ocial life&mdash;and, in the eagerne&s;s and vio|lence of their efforts to reach the goal of &s;uperio|rity, overturn or thru&s;t out of their ordinary path the re&s;t of mankind, till either they provoke again&s;t them a general con&s;piracy of their fellow-creatures, or, till reaching the point of their pur&s;uit, they become elevated objects of homage and admiration. Such men are generally compo&s;ed of great materials for mi&s;chief:&mdash;having &s;trong natural talents and violent ungovernable &s;pirits; according to the di|rection the&s;e get, they are harmle&s;s or mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chievous &mdash;but, like morbid matter in the animal &s;y&s;tem, if not let loo&s;e by &s;ome channel or other, they never fail to di&s;turb the whole economy of the body they belong to, and produce fatal con&s;equences to it and to them&s;elves: Colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have therefore, in &s;ome views, been of u&s;e (as America formerly to

England) to draw off tho&s;e dangerous &s;pirits, who, though they are in times of peace better at a di&s;|tance, in times of war are found to be the toughe&s;t &s;inews of a nation.</P>
<P>The country of Tyrol, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed it, formed bv nature for the re&s;idence of the Syl|van deities, rich in the products of the earth, the people contented and happy, and the whole the region of peace; manufactures, the fir&s;t root of low vices, and commerce, the great in&s;tigator of war, have &s;carcely been able to &s;et their feet there: hence it happens, that there is no channel through which tho&s;e exuberant &s;pirits I have alluded to can take their cour&s;e, or expand their force. Home, there|fore, is no place for tho&s;e of the Tyrole&s;e, who are cur&s;ed or ble&s;&s;ed (call it which you plea&s;e) with tho&s;e very combu&s;tible qualities; and they are obliged to roam abroad in &s;earch of opportunities of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, giving vent to their &s;pirits, and manife&s;ting their talents. They are found, therefore, &s;cattered all over the Continent: and as it rarely happens that opportunities occur in life of &s;ignali&s;ing &s;uch talents in a dignified line, rather than be idle they do what they can, and apply to chicanery as a wide and appropriate field for their genius and vigour to work on&mdash;the emi|grant Tyrole&s;e are, therefore, by mo&s;t nations of the continent, reckoned among the mo&s;t expert and accompli&s;hed &s;harpers in the world&mdash;the peo|ple, however, who remain at home, are of a dif|ferent character&mdash;they are, generally &s;peaking, tall, robu&s;t, and vigorous; the women &s;trong, and very fair; and both &s;exes exhibit a very plea&s;ing mixture of German phlegm and Italian &s;prightline&s;s; or, to &s;peak more properly, they are a mean between tho&s;e two extremes.</P>
<P>Inn&s;pruck, though a &s;mall city, is hand&s;ome and agreeable, &s;tanding in a very beautiful valley, &s;ur|rounded with mountains, which, while their lower
<PB N="123" REF="033487_0122_0FF7233C319F3388">
parts are well cultivated, are capped on the tops with perennial &s;now. The ca&s;tle formerly the re&s;i|dence of the Au&s;trian princes is &s;tately and magni|ficent, adorned within with fine paintings, and decorated without by natural and artificial foun|tains, &s;tatues, plea&s;ant gardens, groves, walks, and covered galleries, leading to five different churches.</P>
<P><HI>A-propas</HI>&mdash;Let me not forget the churches! In a chapel of the Franci&s;can church, there is an image of the Virgin MARY as big as the life, of &s;olid &s;ilver, with many, other images of faints of the &s;ame metal. If &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ilver deities were transferred to Paris, I fear their divinity would not &s;ave them from the hands of the &s;acrilegious Con|vention. One thing, however, is well worth the attention of travellers, particularly tho&s;e who wi&s;h to wipe away the &s;ins of a decea&s;ed friend, and get them a direct pa&s;&s;port to happine&s;s&mdash;This Franci&s;|can church is held to be one of the mo&s;t &s;acred and venerable in the world, on account of the indul|gences granted to it by &s;everal popes; &s;o that one &s;ingle ma&s;s &s;aid in it, is declared to be &s;ufficient to deliver a &s;oul from the pains of purgatory. When we con&s;ider the great and important extent of their power in that re&s;pect, we cannot wonder if they had all the &s;aints in the calendar, and the Virgin MARY to boot, in &s;olid &s;ilver, even of the &s;ize of the Colo&s;&s;us at Rhodes.</P>
<P>Hall, the &s;econd city in Tyrol, lies one league from Inn&s;pruck: it is famous for its &s;alt-works, and for a mint and &s;ilver mines, in which &s;even thou&s;and men, women, and children are con&s;tantly employed.</P>
<P>At a royal palace and ca&s;tle called Ombras, lying at equal di&s;tance from Inn&s;pruck and Hall, there is an ar&s;enal, famous for a prodigious collection of curio&s;ities, &s;uch as medals, precious &s;tones, &s;uits of armour, and &s;tatues of &s;everal princes on hor&s;eback, in their old rich fighting accoutrements; be&s;ides
<PB N="124" REF="033487_0123_0FF7233EF117BBD8">
great variety of military &s;poils and trophies taken by the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; in particular, a &s;tatue of FRANCIS the Fir&s;t and his hor&s;e, ju&s;t as they were taken at the battle of Pavia, and two others of Turki&s;h ba&s;haws, with the co&s;tly habits and appoint|ments with which they were taken, embelli&s;hed with gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones. But, above all their curio&s;ities, the mo&s;t extraordinary is an oak inclo&s;ing the body of a deer: this la&s;t, however unaccountable, is fact; and equals, I think, any of the wonders in the metamorpho&s;es of OVID.</P>
<P>Leaving Inn&s;pruck, I proceeded on my journey, and &s;oon entered into the mountains, which are there of a terrible height&mdash;I was the be&s;t part of a day a&s;cending them: as I got near the top, I was &s;hewn, by my driver, the &s;pot where FERDINAND, king of Hungary, and the Emperor CHARLES the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fth, met, when he returned from Africa, in the year 1520. It is marked with an in&s;cription to that effect, and has grown into a little village, which, from that circum&s;tance, bears the name of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lutation.</P>
<P>Although this mountain, called Bremenberg (or Burning-hill), is covered with &s;now for nine months in the year, it is inhabited to the very top, and produces corn and hay in abundance; at the highe&s;t part there is a po&s;t-hou&s;e, a tavern, and a chapel, where the traveller is accommodated with fre&s;h hor&s;es, provi&s;ions, and, if he choo&s;es, a mouth|ful of prayers&mdash;I availed my&s;elf of the two fir&s;t; but the latter being not altogether in my way, I declined it, for which I could perceive that I was, by every mouth and eye in the place, con&s;igned to perdition as a heretic.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this &s;pot there is a &s;pring of water which falls upon a rock, and divides into two currents, which, at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, a&s;&s;ume the appear|ance, and, in fact, the magnitude too, of very large rivers. The mountain is &s;ometimes difficult to pa&s;s,
<PB N="125" REF="033487_0124_0FF72342226D33B0">
&s;ometimes ab&s;olutely impracticable&mdash;I was fortunate, however, in this re&s;pect; for I got over it without any very extraordinary delay, and on my way was regaled with the mo&s;t delicious veni&s;on that I have ever ta&s;ted in my life; it was &s;aid to be the fle&s;h of a kind of goat.</P>
<P>Although it is but thirty-five miles from Inn|&s;pruck to Bri&s;en, it was late when I reached the latter; and as it contained nothing worth either the trouble or delay attending the &s;earch of it, I &s;et out the next morning, and, travelling with high moun|tains on one &s;ide, and a river all along upon the other, arrived at a town called Bol&s;ano, in the bi&s;hopric of Trent. The country all along was thickly inhabited, and the mountains perfectly cul|tivated and manured even to their highe&s;t tops. On entering the valley of Bol&s;ano, I found the air becoming obviou&s;ly &s;weet, delightful, and tempe|rate; the vineyards, and all the trees and &s;hrubs, olives, mulberries, willows, and ro&s;es, &amp;c. of all the mo&s;t lively green, and every thing marking the mo&s;t luxuriant vegetation.</P>
<P>Bol&s;ano is a &s;mall, but extremely neat and plea|&s;ant town&mdash;but nothing I &s;aw about it plea&s;ed me &s;o much as their vineyards, which are planted in long terraces along the &s;ides of the hills, and are formed into the mo&s;t beautiful arbours, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow above another.</P>
<P>From Bol&s;ano to Trent, is fifty-one miles, a good day's journey: almo&s;t the whole of it lies through the valley of Bol&s;ano, a mo&s;t fruitful and plea&s;ant &mdash;indeed, delightful road, which made the day's journey appear to me much &s;horter than it really was.</P>
<P>Perhaps no part of the habitable globe is, within the &s;ame comparatively &s;mall compa&s;s of earth, &s;o wonderfully diver&s;ified by the hand of nature in all her extremes, as that through which I have ju&s;t carried you. There, under almo&s;t the &s;ame glance

<P>PERHAPS the learned unwi&s;e men of the world, who &s;pend their lives poring after impo&s;&s;i|bilities, have never met with a more copious &s;ub|ject of puzzle-pated enjoyment than the derivation of the names of places. In all di&s;puted ca&s;es on this &s;ubject, the utmo&s;t within human reach is con|jecture; but the joke of it is, that, fortunately for mankind, the certainty of it would not be of a &s;ingle button advantage to them, even if it could be acquired by their &s;earch. Doctor GOLDSMITH, in his <HI>Citizen of the World,</HI> has thrown this matter into high ridicule; and I recommend it to your peru&s;al, le&s;t this &s;hadow of literature &s;hould one

day wheedle you from more re&s;pectable pur&s;uits. Trent has afforded va&s;t exerci&s;e to book-worm con|jectures in this way; for, while &s;ome pronounce it to be derived from Tridentum, and for this pur|po&s;e will have it that NEPTUNE was wor&s;hipped there, though &s;o far from the &s;ea-others claim the di&s;covery of its derivation from Tribus Torren|tibus, or three &s;treams which run there. Now, as to the fir&s;t, exclu&s;ive of forcing NEPTUNE all the way from the Gulph of Venice to their temples, I cannot find any &s;uch &s;imilarity in the &s;ound of Trent and Trident to warrant the inference; and as to the Tribus Torrentibus, they might as well &s;ay that a primmer or hornbook was found there, and that thence it was derived from the alphabet, &s;ince the &s;ame analogy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, namely, that the letters T, R, E, N, T are to be found in both. But, in the name of God, what &s;ignifies what it was called after? Its name is Trent; and if it had been Putney, or John o' Groat's hou&s;e, the town would be neither the better nor the wor&s;e, nor the trea&s;ures of literature &s;uffer any defalcation from the difference.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hopric of Trent is about &s;ixty miles long, and forty broad&mdash;fertile, and abundant in wine, oil, fruit, and pa&s;ture&mdash;and plea&s;ant, the beautiful river Adige meandering through the whole of it from north to &s;outh. The inhabitants are bigoted Ro|man Catholics&mdash;you will the le&s;s wonder, then, that the bi&s;hop &s;hould have &s;o exten&s;ive a princi|pality, and an annual revenue of forty thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>As I receded from Germany, and advanced to|wards Italy, I found the air, the per&s;ons, and the manners of the people, to di&s;play a very great dif|ference, and to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Italians more than tho&s;e of the Germans. Though Popi&s;h big|otry be pretty &s;trong in many parts of Germany, it no where there a&s;&s;umes the gloomy, dete&s;table a&s;pect that it does in Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="033487_0127_0FF7234AEB376E48">And now, &s;ince I have happened to mention the characters of the&s;e two people, I may as well, once for all, more particularly as we are got to the verge of both, give you them in full; in both which I am warranted in &s;aying, that all who know the two will agree with me.</P>
<P>Perhaps contra&s;t was never more perfectly exem|plified than in a compari&s;on between the Germans and Italians; and that contra&s;t &s;trikes more forcibly and &s;uddenly in pa&s;&s;ing from one country in the other, than it would in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace between any two people exi&s;ting. The Italians, jealous, revengeful, treacherous, di&s;&s;embling, &s;ervile, vici|ous, &s;anguinary, idle, and &s;en&s;ual. The Germans, on the contrary, open, good-natured, free from malice and &s;ubtlety, laborious, &s;incere, hone&s;t, and ho&s;pitable&mdash;and, with tho&s;e valuable qualities, pro|perly complai&s;ant. So happy is the character of this people, that to be German hearted has long been a phra&s;e &s;ignifying an hone&s;t man who hated di&s;&s;imulation: and their ho&s;pitality was even in the days of JULIUS CAESAR, remarkable; for we learn from him, that their hou&s;es were open to all men&mdash;that they thought it inju&s;tice to affront a traveller, and made it an article of their religion to protect tho&s;e who came under their roof. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not intemperance in eating and drinking detract from their virtues, no people on earth would bear com|pari&s;on with them for intrin&s;ic worth, and particu|larly for integrity in dealing.</P>
<P>The city of Trent, though not very large in cir|cumference, is populous. The high mountains which &s;urround it, &s;ubject it to all the inconveni|ences of heat and cold&mdash;rendering the air exce&s;&s;ive|ly hot in &s;ummer, and extremely cold in winter; be&s;ides which, they expo&s;e the town to dreadful inundations&mdash;the torrents that de&s;cend from the mountains being &s;ometimes &s;o impetuous as to roll large pieces of rock with them into it, and having &s;everal times laid the whole place wa&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="033487_0128_0FF7234C832920B8">There are in Trent many &s;tately palaces, church|es, and religious hou&s;es. The only one, however, that I will particularize, is that of Saint MARY MAJOR, noted for a prodigious large organ, which can be made to counterfeit all &s;orts of mu&s;ical in|&s;truments, together with the &s;inging of birds, the cries of &s;everal bea&s;ts, and the &s;ounds of drums and trumpets, &s;o exactly, that it is difficult to di&s;|tingui&s;h between the imitation and the reality. To what an end &s;uch an in&s;trument &s;hould be &s;et up in a place of wor&s;hip, I am at a lo&s;s to divine, un|le&s;s it be to add to the rich, u&s;ele&s;s lumber that fills all tho&s;e of Popi&s;h countries.</P>
<P>But that which di&s;tingui&s;hes this church &s;till fur|ther, is, that it is the place where the famous Coun|cil of Trent was held, concerning the Reformation, at which four thou&s;and per&s;ons of a public character, laymen and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This Council &s;at eighteen years before it did any thing; but at la&s;t the Pope contrived to get the a&s;cendant; and, after debating and deliberating &s;o long, not only the Pro|te&s;tants, but even the German and French nations, refu&s;ed to receive its decrees. Certain of the cler|gy, finding the a&s;cendancy that the negotiation of the Pope was getting in this council, &s;aid that the Holy Gho&s;t had been &s;ent here from Rome in a <HI>cloakbag!</HI></P>
<P>Trent once boa&s;ted a curio&s;ity&mdash;which indeed &s;till remains, though out of u&s;e&mdash;that, I think, would be found &s;erviceable in mo&s;t towns in Chri&s;|tendom, and el&s;ewhere too, and particularly at Bath, and &s;uch places. It was a tower on the river Adige, into which the &s;tream was conducted, for the purpo&s;e of drowning &s;uch of the clergy as were convicted of having been too familiar with their neighbours' wives and daughters!</P>
<P>The people of Trent &s;peak promi&s;cou&s;ly, and in|differently, both the German and Italian languages; but whether well or not, I was not adept enough to di&s;cover.</P>

<P>AS I approached Venice, I was much delighted with its appearance. Its &s;tately &s;teeples and noble buildings &s;eemed as if ju&s;t emerging from the &s;ea, and floating on the &s;urface of it; and it required no great &s;tretch of fancy to imagine, that it undulated with the agitated waves of its parent the Adriatic. On all the &s;urrounding coa&s;ts, na|ture and art &s;eemed to have vied with each other in pouring the greate&s;t profu&s;ion of their gifts, while thou&s;ands of ma&s;ts, &s;cattered like fore&s;ts over the &s;urrounding bays, denoted that Venice, not con|tent with her own, &s;hared in the wealth and luxu|ries of other climes.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="033487_0131_0FF7235608663CF0">It is indeed difficult to conceive a more extraor|dinary and plea&s;ing appearance than this city makes at a di&s;tance, whether you approach it from the &s;ea or from the continent.

The &s;teeples are &s;een at &s;ea at the di&s;tance of thirty miles; and the pro&s;pect becomes more beautiful the nearer it is approached&mdash;pre&s;enting in many views the ap|pearance of floating i&s;lands.</P>

<PB N="134" REF="033487_0133_0FF7235A76240BE0">
privilege of &s;itting in the great Council being confined to the nobility; and the doge, under the name of head, being no more than a gaudy &s;lave, loaded with fetters: yet, &s;uch is the idle fondne&s;s of man for &s;uperficial pomp, that this office is &s;ought-after with avidity; for though his power be &s;mall, his &s;tate is very &s;plendid. Hence it is &s;aid, that the doge of Venice is a king in his robes, a &s;enator in council, a pri&s;oner in the city, and a private man out of it; and what is more extraordi|nary, is, that though he may be depo&s;ed, he cannot re&s;ign&mdash;nor even decline the office, if he be once cho&s;en, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to bani&s;hment, and his effects to confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this &s;tate is the Ro|man Catholic; but the Venetians are not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gots, and reject the &s;upremacy of the Pope.

<P>The fir&s;t peculiarity that &s;trikes me, as ari&s;ing immediately from their living, I may &s;ay, in the &s;ea, is the total exclu&s;ion of all &s;ort of carriages; for tho&s;e &s;treets that are on firm ground are ex|tremely narrow and crooked; and on mo&s;t of the canals, &s;o far from having a quay on either &s;ide to walk on, the water comes up to the doors of the hou&s;es; &s;o that walking is but little known, for they get into a boat off their thre&s;hold, and their fir&s;t &s;tep out of it again is, ten to one, on the thre&s;hold of another. This circum&s;tance, though in &s;ome re&s;pects it has its u&s;es, is, in others, ex|tremely di&s;agreeable, as well as injurious; for, though tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to labour have a &s;ufficiency of exerci&s;e, tho&s;e who&s;e condition ex|empts them from labour, and who, therefore, in all other countries, re&s;ort to artificial labour (exer|ci&s;e) for the promotion of health, are here entirely cut off from all &s;uch means of it as we practi&s;e, having neither hunting, &s;hooting, riding, bowling, &amp;c. &amp;c. nor can they have them, unle&s;s they go to the Continent for them. The chief amu&s;ements of the Venetians are re&s;erved for the carnival time, which commences about a week after Chri&s;tmas, and which, therefore, I could not &s;ee; but, from the concurrent te&s;timony of all travellers and the people them&s;elves, as well as from the evidence of

<P>There is an active principle in the mind of man which will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ofter it to re&s;t; it mu&s;t have &s;ome materials to work upon.

I tru&s;t the day of depravity and indelicacy is far removed from us, that will exhibit a Briti&s;h mother arranging a plan of accommodation for her &s;on, and bargaining for a young virgin to commit to his embraces&mdash;as they do in Venice&mdash; not as wife, but as concubine.

<P>The Venetian men are well-featured and well-&s;haped&mdash;the women, well-&s;haped, beautiful, and, it is &s;aid, witty: but I had <HI>that within</HI> which rob|bed every object of its charms; and I might &s;ay with HAMLET, that "man delighted not me, nor woman either."&mdash;In &s;hort, not all the beauties and novelty of the place, not all the plea&s;ures that &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the traveller in the face, and &s;olicit his enjoyment, not all the exqui&s;ite looks of the ladies, could rou&s;e my mind from its melancholy, or fix my attention&mdash; I grew weary of Venice before I had been many hours in it, and determined to gra&s;p at the very fir&s;t opportunity that offered for my departure.</P>
<P>I had arranged, in my own mind, a plan to pro|ceed to Latichea, a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port town in Syria, and thence to Aleppo, whence, as it was a great Ea&s;tern mart, I entertained hopes that I &s;hould find a &s;peedy, or at lea&s;t a certain convey|ance, by a caravan, acro&s;s the de&s;erts, to Ba&s;&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah, and little doubted but that I &s;hould find a ve&s;&s;el at &s;ome of the Venetian ports, either bound, or be|longing to a &s;ea-port of &s;uch commercial con&s;e|quence, upon which I could procure a pa&s;&s;age&mdash; But in this I was di&s;appointed; for, on the fulle&s;t

inquiry that I could make, I found that there was only one &s;hip ready to &s;ail, and no probability of any other for a con&s;iderable time after&mdash;I did every thing I could to avail my&s;elf of this conveyance, but was di&s;appointed, owing to a young lady being pa&s;&s;enger, who was daughter to the owner of the ve&s;&s;el&mdash;and the old gentleman did not approve of an Engli&s;h officer being of the party with his daugh|ter. I u&s;ed ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> argument without &s;ucce&s;s, ur|ging the re&s;ident, Mr STRANGE, who had behaved very politely to me during my &s;hort re&s;idence at Venice, to intere&s;t him&s;elf about it: I likewi&s;e entreated Mrs. STRANGE, an affable, plea&s;ant wo|man, to exert her endeavours, and made her laugh, by propo&s;ing to her to give me a certificate of my behaviour, and to pledge her&s;elf to the old gentle|man that the happine&s;s or honour of his family would not be di&s;turbed by me during the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Hearing, however, that a &s;hip lay at Trie&s;te, which was to &s;ail thence for Alexandria in Egypt, I determined to embrace that opportunity, and, in|&s;tead of my former intended route, go to Grand Cairo, thence to Saez, and &s;o down the Red Sea, by way of Mecca, to Moca, and thence to Aden, which company's ve&s;&s;els, or India country traders are always to be found going to one or other of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;et out for Trie&s;te, with all the im|patience of a &s;anguine mind, anxious to change place, eager to pu&s;h forward, and full of the new route I had laid down&mdash;the charms of which, par|ticularly of &s;eeing Grand Cairo, the Land of Egypt, and the Pyramids, were painted by my imagination in all the glowing exaggerated colours of romance. The captain of the ve&s;&s;el was then at Venice, and I accompanied him to Trie&s;te, which is about &s;ixty miles from Venice.</P>
<P>Soon after our arrival at Trie&s;te, I had the mor|tification to find, that the ve&s;&s;el was by no means

likely to keep pace with the ardour of my mind, and that, owing to &s;ome unfore&s;een event, her de|parture was to be delayed; &s;o, after a few of tho&s;e effu&s;ions which may be &s;uppo&s;ed on &s;uch an occa&s;i|on to e&s;cape a man of no very cool temper hanging on the tenter-hooks of expectation, I found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;it down, and patiently wait the revolu|tion of time and event, which nothing could either impede or accelerate.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, and is held as a point of faith by Prede&s;tinarians, that &s;ome men are doomed by fate to di&s;appointment&mdash;and that, when they are &s;o, no wi&s;dom can obviate, no vigilance provide again&s;t, nor no re&s;olution re&s;i&s;t, her de|crees; but, that, in &s;pite of all the efforts of rea&s;on and indu&s;try, a &s;eries of &s;ini&s;ter events &s;hall pur&s;ue them through life, and meet them at every turn they attempt to take. Such has been my lot for the greate&s;t part of my life&mdash;but I have neither faith enough in prede&s;tination, nor &s;elf-love enough &s;o far to blind me to my own faults, as to &s;uppo&s;e that lady Fate had any thing at all to do with it. No, no; it was often owing to a temper, warm, impa|tient, and uncontroled, which, in almo&s;t all cares of momentary embarra&s;&s;ment, cha&s;ed rea&s;on from her office, u&s;urped her place, and decided as chance directed. Let every man examine the grounds of all his &s;erious di&s;appointments in life with candour, and he will find phy&s;ical cau&s;es to which to a&s;&s;ign them, without re&s;orting to &s;upernatural. For my part, when I hear a man &s;ay that he has been all his life pur&s;ued by ill-fortune, I directly conclude, that either he has been a blunderer, or tho&s;e he dealt with, brutes. In the ordinary operation of earthly contingencies, mi&s;chances will happen; but an uniform life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mi&s;chance can only ari&s;e from mi&s;|management, or a very extraordinary chain of human inju&s;tice.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="033487_0140_0FF72370EDA85AC0">The&s;e reflections aro&s;e from the following in|cident:</P>
<P>I had procured a &s;ervant to attend me on my journey, who, from my &s;hort ob&s;ervation of him, promi&s;ed to contribute very con&s;iderably to my comfort, my convenience, and, indeed, to my &s;e|curity, as he was apparently hone&s;t, &s;incere, active, and clever in his duty, and ma&s;ter of &s;everal lan|guages, and particularly of the <HI>lingua Franca,</HI> a mixture of languages, peculiarly u&s;eful in travel|ling through the Ea&s;t. Finding that I was likely to be delayed at Trie&s;te, and conceiving that in this interim letters from England, for which I mo&s;t ardently longed, might have arrived at Venice for me, I imprudently and impetuou&s;ly &s;ent him to Venice, for the purpo&s;e of taking them up, and carrying them to me. But gue&s;s what mu&s;t have been my feelings when I found, almo&s;t immedi|ately after his departure, that the ve&s;&s;el was prepar|ing to &s;ail, and that I mu&s;t either lo&s;e my pa&s;&s;age or my &s;ervant: anx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous though I was to get forward, and grievous though my former delay had been to me, I he&s;itated which to do; but prudence, for once, prevailed over inclination; and I determin|ed, at all events, to depart, under all the embarra&s;&s;|ment attending the want of a &s;ervant and lingui&s;t, and all the poignant feelings of having been acce&s;|&s;ary to the di&s;appointment, and perhaps the injury of a poor fellow, whom I really conceived to be a per&s;on of merit. In our pa&s;&s;age to Alexandria we touched at Zante, an i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Greece, belonging to Venice; it was anciently called Za|cy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s&mdash;is about fifty miles in circumference, and contains fifty thou&s;and inhabitants.

<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tages of melancholy, con&s;olation is rejected by the mind as premature.

<P>AT the time I &s;et out upon my journey over land to India, I was (though married, and the father of children) very young, naturally of a &s;anguine con&s;titution: my attachment to the fair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ex was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ways dimini&s;hed by a military education: and a warmth of temper, an ardent &s;en&s;ibility of mind, and a frank un&s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition, left me but too often to regret the facility with which I yielded to the charms of women. But the regret for each error was wilfully &s;mothered in vain determinations of amendment&mdash;and the promi&s;ed amendment again broken in upon by &s;ome new error. Thus it was, till riper years and circum&s;tances of weight &s;trength|ened my rea&s;on, and gave it in &s;ome greater degree that dominion it &s;hould have over my actions.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as I have in my la&s;t letter de&s;cribed my&s;elf to be, and con&s;tituted by nature and educa|tion as I have mentioned above, I landed in the charming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;land of Zante, where nature her&s;elf &s;eems to have con&s;pired again&s;t cha&s;tity&mdash;making the very air breathe nothing but tran&s;port and de|light.

In &s;hort, I &s;o very eagerly enforced my propo&s;al to accompany me, and time was &s;o very &s;hort, that &s;he con&s;ented, and in two hours we had arranged every thing for our depar|ture together&mdash;and here with &s;hame and horror I confe&s;s (nor &s;hall ever cea&s;e to regret it), that this ecclai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eci&s;&s;ement communicated the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay of &s;ub|&s;tantial plea&s;ure to my heart that it felt &s;ince I left London.</P>
<P>Thus far, our project &s;ailed before the wind: wayward imagination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it out in the mo&s;t alluring drapery that fancy could fabricate, and prevented us from &s;eeing the impract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cability of it, as it &s;tood in the nakedne&s;s of truth; and when it came to be carried into execution, a thou&s;and diffi|culties occurred, that the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, and the warmth of our feelings, had before concealed

from our view. In the fir&s;t place, it was nece&s;&s;ary for her to obtain the con&s;ent of a lady to who&s;e care and protection &s;he was committed: in the next place, accommodations were to be procured for her in the &s;ame &s;hip with me&mdash;a circum&s;tance of mo&s;t arduous difficulty; be&s;ides which, a variety of other impediments&mdash;in&s;uperable indeed&mdash;concur|red to fru&s;trate our views, and put an end to our project. If my plea&s;ure at meeting her was great, my angui&s;h at parting with her was inexpre&s;&s;ible. I had once more to face the world alone; and, on the &s;econd day of my &s;ojourning at Zante, emba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked with a heavy heart, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et &s;ail for Alex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

I never reflected, as I have &s;ince done, what &s;erious mi&s;chiefs, what endle&s;s mi&s;ery, what lo&s;s of time, means, and reputation, I may by that providential di&s;appointment have e&s;caped&mdash;for the&s;e are the al|mo&s;t never-failing con&s;equences of &s;uch affairs. It too often happens, that the &s;yren who deludes a man into her &s;nares, is the very per&s;on who inflicts the deadly wound into his heart. Avoid, my dear FREDERICK! avoid all &s;uch, as you would avoid plague, pe&s;tilence, or ruin&mdash;&s;teel your heart by timely reflection again&s;t their advances. In all your tran&s;actions with women, like a good general in warfare, &s;ecure for your heart a retreat; for it will be too late to find that they are unworthy when your heart is en&s;nared&mdash;and when you find them worthy of your affection, it will be time enough to give a loo&s;e to the &s;en&s;ibility of your heart. A virtuous woman is beyond all calculation to be valued, when &s;he is found; but, alas! in finding her, you may pa&s;s through &s;o many fires ordeal, and run &s;uch danger, that it is almo&s;t a doubt, whe|ther a wi&s;e man (if he can fetter his pa&s;&s;ions) had

<P>On my arrival at Alexandria, I found, to my fre&s;h mortification, that the plague was raging all over Egypt&mdash;and as, if this was not of it&s;elf &s;uffi|cient to block up my intended route, an irruption of the Arabs, who in formidable bodies infe&s;ted all the roads, put a period to all my hopes of &s;eeing Grand Cairo, and viewing the curio&s;ities of that country, which all who, like us, have the Bible put early into their hands, are taught to venerate as &s;oon as they are taught to read. Here I thought to have viewed the pyramids, who&s;e antiquity, ori|gin, or intended u&s;e, have baffled the learned and ingenious inquiries of &s;o many ages&mdash;of beholding Mount Sinai, the &s;tone of Mo&s;es, the tract of the I&s;raelites, all of which are &s;aid to be clearly pointed out, and geography by that means brought into the &s;upport of Sacred Hi&s;tory. The&s;e, and many things, I did wi&s;h to &s;ee&mdash;they are worth it: but I have had &s;ince rea&s;on to believe, that my ill luck was not &s;o great as I then thought it; for the &s;earch is dangerous, and made prodigiou&s;ly expen&s;ive by the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions of the Mahomedan magi&s;trates. It is as well, therefore, to travel over this country in books, which afford us good information, and more of it, at an ea&s;ier rate than you could purcha&s;e it in the country.</P>
<P>Alexandria was built by ALEXANDER the Great, &s;oon after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before CHRIST, and is &s;ituated on the Mediterra|nean, twelve miles we&s;t of that mouth of the Nile, anciently called Canopicum. A very extraordinary circum&s;tance is related as a proof of the &s;uddenne&s;s of ALEXANDER'S re&s;olution to build it: After he had directed the number of public &s;trictures, and fixed the places where they were to &s;tand, there were no in&s;truments at hand proper for marking out the walls, according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="033487_0146_0FF7237F01749EA0">
times: upon this, a workman advi&s;ed the King to collect what meal was among the &s;oldiers, and &s;ift it in lines upon the ground, in order to mark out the circuit of the walls: the advice was followed, and the king's &s;ooth&s;ayer interpreted it to be a pre|&s;age of the future pro&s;perity and abundance of the city. This prophecy was certainly afterwards ve|rified; for it &s;oon became the emporium of com|merce, of arts, and of &s;ciences.</P>
<P>By the de&s;cription of STRABO and other anci|ents, it appears that this city was built upon a plan well worthy the va&s;t mind of its founder; and the fragments of its ornaments afterwards made part of the grande&s;t embelli&s;hments of Rome and Con&s;tantino|ple. In the mu&s;eum of the royal palace, which occupied a fourth part of the city, the body of ALEXANDER was depo&s;ited in a golden coffin&mdash; but the dete&s;table SELDUCUS CIBYOFACTES viola|ted the monument, took away the golden coffin, and &s;ub&s;tituted a gla&s;s one in its place.</P>
<P>This city like mo&s;t others of antiquity, has been the &s;cene of terrible ma&s;&s;acres. About two hun|dred years after its foundation, it was totally depo|pulated by PTOLEMY PHYSCON&mdash;the very few who e&s;caped &s;tronger, flying into other countries. De&s;irous, however, not to reign over empty hou&s;es, he &s;educed inhabitants from the neighbouring coun|tries; and again, for &s;ome &s;light offence, determin|ed on a general ma&s;&s;acre of the young men; and accordingly, when they were one day a&s;&s;embled in the Gymna&s;ium, or place of public exerci&s;e, he ordered it to be &s;et on fire, &s;o that all peri&s;hed, either in the flames, or by the &s;words of his mer|cenaries, whom he had placed at all the avenues. Afterwards, in the year of CHRIST 215, the Em|peror CARACAILA, having been lampooned by &s;ome of the inhabitants, ordered a gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al ma&s;&s;acre by his numerous troops, who were di&s;per&s;ed over the city. The inhuman orders being given, all were
<PB N="148" REF="033487_0147_0FF72382854E0840">
murdered, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex; &s;o that, in one night's time, the whole city floated in blood, and every hou&s;e was filled with carca&s;es: the mon&s;ter him&s;elf, retiring to the temple of Se|rapis, was all the time imploring the protection of the Deity&mdash;a proof that practical devotion and the mo&s;t atrocious inhumanity may meet in the &s;ame bo&s;om. As if this had not been &s;ufficient ven|geance, he &s;tripped the city of all its ancient pri|vileges&mdash;ordered all &s;trangers who lived there to depart&mdash;and, that the few who remained might not have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing one another, he cut off all communication of one &s;treet with ano|ther, by walls built for the purpo&s;e, and guarded with troops.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ma&s;&s;acres, Alexandria again recovered its former &s;plendour&mdash;and was again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by AMROU, the infamous Saracen&mdash;and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">repid youth of the city peri&s;hed with arms in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hands.

<P>The great advantages of the Ea&s;t India trade, which was then carried on by the Red Sea, pre|&s;erved Alexandria through &s;everal re&s;olutions; but having fallen under the dominion of the Turks, and the pa&s;&s;age round the Cape of Good Hope being di&s;covered, a fatal blow was given to its commerce, and it has &s;ince fallen to decay. It is, however, even now, worth the attention of the cla&s;&s;ical traveller. Entering the harbour, we pa&s;|&s;ed by the I&s;land of Pharos, were PTOLEMY built the enormous tower which was once the wonder of the world; and, when riding within the port, no|thing could be more gratifying than to &s;ee from thence that mixture of ancient and modern monu|ments

that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the view, on which ever &s;ide the eye could be turned.</P>
<P>Of myriads of antiquities which this place af|fords for the in&s;pection of the curious, I &s;hall men|tion only two&mdash;One, the column of POMPEY, on viewing of which, the remembrance of that great and good man's mo&s;t unmerited and cruel fate ex|tracted a &s;igh from the bottom of my heart: this pillar engages the attention of all travellers; it is compo&s;ed of red granite; the capital is Corinthian, with palm leaves, and not indented; the &s;haft and the upper member of the ba&s;e are of one piece, ninety feet long; and nine in diameter; the ba&s;e, a &s;quare of fifteen feet on each &s;ide; the whole column is one hundred and fourteen feet high, perfectly well poli&s;hed, and only a little &s;hivered on the ea&s;tern &s;ide. Nothing can equal the maje&s;ty of this monument: &s;een from a di&s;tance it over-tops the town, and &s;erves as a &s;ignal for ve&s;&s;els; approaching it nearer, it produces an a&s;toni&s;hment mixed with awe: one would never be tired of ad|miring the beauty of the capital, the length of the &s;haft, nor the extraordinary &s;implicity of the pe|de&s;tal. Some years ago, a party of Engli&s;h &s;eamen contrived, by flying a kite, to draw a line over the pillar, and by that means made a kind of a &s;hroud, by which they got up, and on the very top of it drank a bowl of punch, to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of a multitude who came to &s;ee them; they broke off one of the volutes of the column, but amply compen&s;ated for this mi&s;chief by a di&s;covery they made, as, without their evidence, the world would not have known, at this hour, that there was ori|ginally a &s;tatue on this column, one foot and ancle of which, of enormous &s;ize, are &s;till remaining.&mdash; The other is the obeli&s;k of CLEOPATRA, of im|men&s;e &s;ize, and of one &s;ingle piece of granite mar|ble. Here I ob&s;erved, too, a thick wall, with towers mouldering under extreme age, which con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ained,

The&s;e circum&s;tances tend to demon&s;trate, that, far back beyond the reach of our calculation, the arts flouri&s;hed: and when one thinks of the miraculous ma&s;&s;es of work done in former ages&mdash;the magnitude of the pieces of which tho&s;e works were compo&s;ed, &s;uch as whole columns and obeli&s;ks of a &s;ingle block of marble&mdash;the Co|lo&s;&s;us of Rhodes, made of bra&s;s, one foot of which was placed on one &s;ide of the harbour, and another on the other &s;ide, &s;o that &s;hips pa&s;&s;ed between its legs&mdash;we cannot help yielding up the palm to the ancients for &s;tupendous magnificence, however we may &s;urpa&s;s them for the u&s;eful, the elegant, and the good.</P>
<P>At Alexandria I remained about twelve days, till, wearied of the confined &s;tate I lived in on account of the plague, I re&s;olved to devi&s;e &s;ome m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, if po&s;&s;ible, to get away, and at length hired a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at to carry me to the i&s;land of Cyprus, from whence I concluded, that I &s;hould find no &s;ort of difficulty in procuring a conveyance to Latichea, and &s;o proceed by my fir&s;t intended route. I ac|cordingly arrived at Cyprus in perfect &s;afety, where, to my great &s;orrow and a&s;toni&s;hment, I found that an epidemical fever, equal in its effects to a plague, prevailed: however, there was no alternative; I mu&s;t run the ri&s;que, and I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boat that carried me from Alexandria.</P>
<P>Although the etymologies of the names of places are of very little importance, and mo&s;t frequently uncertain, I think it probable that the learned are r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght, who a&s;&s;ert the name of this is derived from Cyprus, or Cypre&s;s&mdash;with which &s;hurbs the i&s;land
<PB N="151" REF="033487_0150_0FF72389DD5F8418">
abounds. It had, in ancient times, a number of other names&mdash;one of which was Paphia, whence Venus&punc; who was wor&s;hipped in it, was called the Paphian Godde&s;s. It lies thirty miles we&s;t of Sy|ria, whither I was bound, &s;tretching from the &s;outh-we&s;t to the north-ea&s;t, one hundred and fifty miles in length, and &s;eventy in breadth in the wide&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>This i&s;land holds a very high rank in cla&s;&s;ic lore &mdash;It gave birth to &s;ome great philo&s;ophers and con|&s;iderable poets&mdash;The Apo&s;tle BARNABAS was a na|tive of it, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ST. PAUL, fir&s;t intro|duced Chri&s;tianity among them. Famagu&s;ta, a town on the ea&s;tern part of the i&s;land, oppo&s;ite to the &s;hore of Syria, is the ancient Salamis, built by TEUCER the &s;on of TELAMON, and brother of AJAX.</P>
<P>Symi&s;&s;o, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, the be&s;t port in Cy|prus, is the <HI>Amathus</HI> mentioned by VIRGIL, in his Aeneid, and by OVID in his Metamorpho&s;es. And Baffo. on the We&s;tern coa&s;t, is the Paphos of antiquity, famous for the Temple of Venus.</P>
<P>As the branches of an empire mo&s;t remote from the great &s;eat of government are always more de&s;|potically governed than tho&s;e near the &s;ource of redre&s;s, Cyprus has been continually ruled with a rod of iron &s;ince it came into the hands of the Turks. While it was under the dominion of Chri&s;tians, it was well peopled, having no le&s;s than eight hundred or a thou&s;and villages in it, be&s;ides &s;everal hand&s;ome cities; but the Turks have &s;pread ruin and de&s;olation over the country, and it is now &s;o thinly inhabited that more than half the lands lie uncultivated.</P>
<P>The air of this i&s;land is now for the mo&s;t part unwhole&s;ome, owing to the damps ari&s;ing from the many fens and mar&s;hes with which the country abounds&mdash;while, there being but few &s;prings or rivers in the i&s;land, the want of a plentiful fall of
<PB N="152" REF="033487_0151_0FF7238DA2D2A858">
rain, at proper periods, di&s;tre&s;&s;es the inhabitants very much in another way; and by means of the uncultivated &s;tate of the country, they are greatly infe&s;ted with poi&s;onous reptiles of various kinds.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable mountain in Cyprus is cal|led Olympus&mdash;a name common to &s;everal other mountains in Greece, particularly to that in The&s;&s;a|ly, &s;o famous in the poetry of the ancients. That in Cyprus is about fifty miles in circumference: great part of it is covered with woods; and at the foot of it are fine vineyards, which produce admi|rable wine, not only in a &s;ufficiency for their own con&s;umption, but &s;ome al&s;o for exportation. And although the greater part of the i&s;land lies unculti|vated, as I have before ob&s;erved, it produces a &s;uf|ficient quantity of corn, unle&s;s in &s;ea&s;ons when their harve&s;t fails, in which ca&s;e the people are ea&s;i|ly &s;upplied from the continent. They have, be|&s;ides, cattle enough for their own con&s;umption. Many parts of the country abound in wild fowl, and &s;everal &s;orts of game, and they have plenty of fi&s;h upon the &s;ea coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The trade of Cyprus is not incon&s;iderable, and carried on chiefly by Jews and Armenians: the commodities in which they deal are wine, oil, cot|ton, wool, &s;alt, &s;ilk, and turpentine&mdash;be&s;ides, it produces &s;everal &s;orts of earth, fit for the u&s;e of painters, particularly red, black, and yellow.</P>
<P>Its mo&s;t wonderful production, however, is the famous &s;tone (A&s;be&s;tos) inextingui&s;hable, or (Ami|antos) impollutus, &s;o called from its extraordinary property of re&s;i&s;ting fire. It is related that the an|cients m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de out of this &s;tone a kind of thread that would r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rn uncon&s;umed in the mo&s;t inten&s;e fire. It is even &s;aid, that &s;ome experiments have been made in modern days, which have &s;ufficiently prov|ed that the thing is not a fiction. In &s;uch extraor|dinary que&s;tions as this, though I do not po&s;itively contradict, I always &s;u&s;pend my belief, till &s;omething
<PB N="153" REF="033487_0152_0FF723902633FFB0">
&s;tronger than mere a&s;&s;ertion is offered to convince me.</P>
<P>There is one dreadful mi&s;chief to which this i&s;land is &s;ubject. In the hot &s;ea&s;on, locu&s;ts come from the Continent, in &s;warms &s;o va&s;t and &s;o thick as to darken the &s;ky like clouds. Tho&s;e would certainly devour all the fruits of the earth, if they were not driven to &s;ea by a north wind that u&s;ually blows at the time of their coming. When that wind hap|pens to fail, which fortunately is &s;eldom, the con&s;e|quence is a total demolition of the fruits of the country.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land, as well as particular towns, was entirely con&s;ecrated to the godde&s;s VENUS, who thence was called VENUS CYPRIA, or DEA CYPRIA, and is repre&s;ented by the poets as taking a preculiar plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting it; and this unque&s;ti|onably aro&s;e from the loo&s;e habits and la&s;civious temperament of the women there, who certainly are, at this time, not remarkable for cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that I felt great plea|&s;ure in entering Cyprus; it was, as I have already &s;tated, cla&s;&s;ic ground, and dedicated to the Queen of Love. But a traveller who vi&s;its it with &s;hapes of amu&s;ement, will be much di&s;appointed; for in no one particular did it &s;eem to me to re&s;emble that Cyprus famed in the Heathen Story and Mytholo|gy. Of the Cyprian queen's favours the ladies &s;eemed to boa&s;t no one ma&s;k, &s;ave the mo&s;t nau&s;eous, di&s;gu&s;ting lewdne&s;s; and the natural fertility of the &s;oil is half lo&s;t beneath the oppre&s;&s;ive yoke of the &s;ervants of the Turki&s;h government. Thus, in the extraordinary revolutions that human affairs are in|ce&s;&s;antly undergoing, that i&s;land which for its &s;upe|rior beauties was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the re&s;idence of love, which gave birth to the philo&s;ophers ZENO, APPOLLONIUS, anD XENOPHON, is now a mi&s;e|rable, half-cultivated &s;pot, peopled with a mixture of wretched Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Chri&s;tians
<PB N="154" REF="033487_0153_0FF72392E95135A0">
&mdash;groaning under the tyranny of a barbarous de&s;po|tic abu&s;e of delegated power&mdash;infe&s;ted with locu&s;ts which devour the fruits of the earth&mdash;and di&s;graced by a race of ignominious women, who e&s;teem it to be an act of religion to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to all &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Our RICHARD the Fir&s;t made a conque&s;t of this i&s;land on his way to the Holy Land, and conferred the royalty of it on GUY LUSIGNAN, king of Je|ru&s;alem. The Venetians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it in the year 1480&mdash;but, in the &s;ixteenth century, the Turks di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, and have ever &s;ince kept it under the yoke&mdash;I &s;hould have remarked that then wine is excellent.</P>
<P>Continuing my route, I hired another boat, after only forty-eight hours &s;tay at Cyprus, and proceed|ed for Latichea, which, as I have &s;omewhere be|fore mentioned, is a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port town of Syria, built on a promontory of land, which, run|ning into the &s;ea, occa&s;ions its being continually refre&s;hed with breezes. Fortune, who had hither|to been not very liberal in her di&s;pen&s;ations, now favoured me; for, ju&s;t as I arrived at Latichea, a caravan was preparing. The con&s;ul of the Turki&s;h Company at Cyprus received me with great polite|ne&s;s and ho&s;pitality&mdash;gave me a letter to the re&s;ident at Latichea; and by his in&s;truction and a&s;&s;i&s;&s;tance, after a very &s;hort &s;tay, I &s;et out on my way to Alep|po with the caravan.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion more particular|ly to de&s;cribe the nature or tho&s;e caravans, I &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, tell you, that this was compo&s;ed of no other bea&s;ts of burden than mules and a&s;&s;es, of which there were not le&s;s than three or four hundred in number.</P>
<P>Mounted on a mule, I travelled along, well plea&s;ed with the fertile appearance of the country, and delighted with the &s;erenity of the air&mdash;We were, as well as I can now recollect, near ten days on the road; during which time we travelled only
<PB N="155" REF="033487_0154_0FF72394C31B1AE0">
in the morning early, and in the heat of the day repo&s;ed under the &s;hade of trees.</P>
<P>I was informed, that if, in&s;tead of going to Lati|chea, I had gone to Scandaroon (otherwi&s;e Alexan|dretta), I &s;hould, in the road from thence to Aleppo, have travelled through a country, in which the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extravagant cu&s;toms prevail that exi&s;t in any country emerged from barbari&s;m&mdash;Several of tho&s;e I heard; but one in particular was, that the men pro&s;tituted their wives and daughters to all comers&mdash;and that this originated from a principle of religion, though there was every rea&s;on to believe, that, like many of their religious in&s;titutions, it was made at la&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to the gratification of avarice.</P>
<P>On my way to Aleppo, I was met by a Mr. &mdash;, an Engli&s;h gentleman, who had heard of my coming, and who, in the mo&s;t kind and ho&s;pitable manner, in&s;i&s;ted upon my living at his hou&s;e in&s;tead of the Briti&s;h con&s;ul's, where I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have re|&s;ided during my &s;tay there; and his manner of a&s;king me was &s;o engaging, intere&s;ting, and impre&s;|&s;ive, that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>As the great public caravan had departed from Aleppo before my arrival, and the expence of fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ming a private one on my account was too great, as I was travelling on my own account, and had no di&s;patches to authori&s;e or enforce my departure, or bear me out in the expence; I was con&s;trained to remain at Aleppo till &s;ome eligible mode of travel|ling occurred, or another public caravan was formed. This delay gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing and informing my&s;elf of the city and &s;urrounding coun|try; the re&s;ult of which, I &s;hall, in as &s;hort a man|ner as po&s;&s;ible, relate to you in a future letter.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SO long as the route of my journey lay through European regions, little pre&s;ented it&s;elf re|&s;pecting human nature of &s;uch very great novelty as to excite admiration or awaken curio&s;ity. In all the various nations through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, a certain parity of &s;entiment, ari&s;ing from the ore great &s;ub&s;tratum, Chri&s;tianity, gave the &s;ame general colouring to all the &s;cenes, however they might differ from each other in their various &s;hadings. Whatever di&s;&s;imilitude the influence of accident, climate, or local circum&s;tance, may, in the revolutions of ages, have introduced into their manners, cu&s;toms muni|cipal laws, and exterior forms of wor&s;hip&mdash;the great code of religion and moral &s;entiment remains nearly the &s;ame with all: and right and wrong, good and evil, being defined by the &s;ame principles of rea&s;on, and a&s;certained by the &s;ame boundaries, bring the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le of conduct of each to &s;o clo&s;e an approx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mation with that of the orders, that, when compared with tho&s;e we are now to attend to, they may really be con&s;idered as one and the &s;ame people.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="033487_0156_0FF7239BC2DD3720">In the empire now before us, were we to leave our judgment to the guidance of general opinion of Chri&s;tian nations, we &s;hould have, on the contrary, to contemplate man under a variety of forms and modifications, &s;o entirely different from tho&s;e to which habit has familiari&s;ed our minds, as at fir&s;t to impre&s;s us with an idea of a total di&s;ruption from our nature, and induce us, as it has already the ge|nerality of our people, to divorce them from a par|ticipation of all tho&s;e &s;ympathetic feelings which &s;erve to enforce the di&s;charge of mutual good offices among men. Deducing all their principles, not only of moral conduct, but municipal government, from a religion radically different from, and e&s;&s;enti|ally adver&s;e to, ours; deluded by that &s;y&s;tem into a variety of opinions which liberality it&s;elf mu&s;t think ab&s;urd; unaided by that enlightened philo&s;ophy which learning, and learned men, acting under the influence of comparative freedom, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the art of printing, have diffu&s;ed through the ma&s;s of Europeans; and living under a climate the mo&s;t unfavourable to intellectual or bodily exertion, they exhibit a &s;pectacle which the philo&s;ophic and liberal mind mu&s;t view with di&s;approbation, regret, and pity&mdash;the illiberal fierce Chri&s;tian with unequalifi|ed dete&s;tation and di&s;gu&s;t: while, on their part, bigoted to their own principles and opinions, they look on us with abhorrence, and indulge as con&s;ci|entious a contempt of, and antipathy to Chri&s;tians, which I apprehend no lap&s;e of time, without a great change of circum&s;tance, will be able to eradi|cate. Should Mahomedani&s;m and Chri&s;tianity ever happen to merge in Dei&s;m (but not otherwi&s;e), the inhabitants of Syria and Europe will agree to con|&s;ider each other even as fellow creatures. In Spain and Portugal, Jew, Turk, and indeed Pro|te&s;tant, are without di&s;tinction called hogs. In Turkey, Jews and Chri&s;tians are di&s;criminately called dogs; each thinking the other completely

excluded from the pale of humanity, and well wor|thy the dagger of any TRUE BELIEVER who would have the <HI>piety</HI> to apply it.</P>
<P>You will allow, my dear FREDERICK, that it mu&s;t have been rather an important contemplation to your father, to have perhaps two thou&s;ands miles to travel through the immen&s;e and almo&s;t trackle&s;s wilds of a country inhabited by &s;uch people, without the con|&s;olation of any others to accompany him in his jour|ney; for, unle&s;s a public di&s;patch was to overtake me, there was little probability of my having a &s;in|gle European partner of my fatigue and perils.</P>
<P>However, as the period was not yet arrived at which I was to go forward, or even determine my mode of travelling, I endeavoured to &s;oothe my mind as much as I could into content, and to take advan|tage of my &s;tay at Aleppo, to acquire all the know|ledge po&s;&s;ible of the place, that is to &s;ay, of that city in particular, and of the Turki&s;h government and manners in general.</P>
<P>A di&s;tant view of Aleppo fills the mind with expectations of great &s;plendour and magnificence. The mo&s;ques, the towers, the large ranges of hou&s;es with flat roofs, ri&s;ing above each other, ac|cording to the &s;loping hills on which they &s;tand, the whole variegated with beautiful rows of trees, form altogether a &s;cene magnificent, gay, and de|lightful: but, on entering the town, all tho&s;e ex|pected beauties vani&s;h, and leave nothing in the &s;treets to meet the eye, but a di&s;mal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of high &s;tone walls, gloomy as the rece&s;&s;es of a con|vent or &s;tate pri&s;on, and unenlivened by windows, embelli&s;hed, as with us, by the human face divine. The &s;treets them&s;elves, not wider than &s;ome of the meane&s;t alleys in London, overca&s;t by the height of the pri&s;on-hou&s;es on either &s;ide, are rendered &s;till more formidably gloomy by the &s;olitude and &s;ilence that pervade them; while here and there a lattice towards the top, barely vi&s;ible, &s;trikes the
<PB N="159" REF="033487_0158_0FF7239FF8CFCED8">
&s;oul with the gloomy idea of thraldom, coercion, and impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>This dete&s;table mode of building, which owes its origin to jealou&s;y, and the &s;candalous re&s;traints every man is empowered by the laws and religion of the place to impo&s;e upon the women con&s;igned either by &s;ale or birth to his tyranny, extends not to the in&s;ide of the hou&s;es, many of which are magnificent and hand&s;ome, and all admirably &s;uited to the exigencies of the climate, and the dome&s;tic cu&s;toms and manner of living of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The city is adorned, it is true, here and there, with mo&s;ques and appendant towers, called Mina|rets, from which cryers call the faithful to prayers; and in &s;ome of the &s;treets there are arches built at certain di&s;tances from each other, &s;o as to carry the eye directly through them, and form a vi&s;ta of con|&s;iderable grandeur: but all the&s;e are far from &s;uffi|cient to counterbalance the general a&s;pect or gloo|mine&s;s and &s;olitude which reigns over the whole, and renders it &s;o peculiarly di&s;gu&s;ting, particularly at fir&s;t &s;ight, to an Engli&s;hman who has enjoyed the gaiety and contemplated the freedom of a city in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The mo&s;ques (Mahomedan temples) are extreme|ly numerous in this city; indeed almo&s;t as much &s;o as churches and convents in the Popi&s;h countries of Chri&s;tendom. There is nothing in their exter|nal appearance to attract the notice of the traveller, or indulge the eye of the architect; they are almo&s;t all of one form&mdash;an oblong quadrangle: and as to the in&s;ide, I never had an opportunity of &s;eeing one; none but Mu&s;&s;ulmen being permitted to enter them, at lea&s;t at Aleppo.</P>
<P>The next buildings of a public kind to the mo&s;ques that de&s;erve to be particularly mentioned, are the caravan&s;eras&mdash;buildings which, whether we con&s;ider the &s;pirit of beneficence and charity that fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted them, their national importance, or
<PB N="160" REF="033487_0159_0FF723A377BFA6F8">
their exten&s;ive utility, may rank, though not in &s;plendour of appearance, at lea&s;t in true value, with any to be found in the world.</P>
<P>Caravan&s;eras were originally intended for, and are now pretty generally applied to, the accommo|dation of &s;trangers and travellers, though, like every other good in&s;titution, &s;ometimes perverted to the purpo&s;es of private emolument or public job: they are built at proper di&s;tances through the roads of the Turki&s;h dominions, and afford the indigent or weary traveller an a&s;ylum from the inclemency of the weather; are in general very large, and built of the mo&s;t &s;olid and durable materials; have com|monly one &s;tory above the ground floor, the lower of which is arched, and &s;erves for warehou&s;es to &s;tow goods, for lodgings and for &s;tables, while the upper is u&s;ed merely for lodgings; be&s;ides which, they are always accommodated with a fountain, and have cooks &s;hops and other conveniencies to &s;up|ply the wants of the lodgers. In Aleppo the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avan&s;eras are almo&s;t exclu&s;ively occupied by merchants, to whom they are, like other hou&s;es, rented.</P>
<P>The &s;uburbs of Aleppo, and the &s;urrounding country, are very hand&s;ome, plea&s;ant, and, to a per&s;on coming out of the gloomy city, in &s;ome re|&s;pects intere&s;ting. Some to&s;&s;ed about into hill and valley lie under the hands of the hu&s;bandman; others are covered with hand&s;ome villas; and others again &s;aid out in gardens, whither the people of Aleppo occa&s;ionally re&s;ort for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The roofs of all the hou&s;es are flat, and formed of a compo&s;ition which re&s;i&s;ts the weather effectu|ally. On tho&s;e mo&s;t of the people &s;leep in the very hot weather: they are &s;eparated from each other by walls; but the Franks, who live contigu|ous to one another, and who, from their di&s;agreea|ble circum&s;tances with regard to the Turks, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a friendly and
<PB N="161" REF="033487_0160_0FF723A5F8F6D708">
harmonious intercour&s;e together, have doors of communication, which are attended with the&s;e for|tunate and plea&s;ing advantages, that they can make a large circuit without de&s;cending into the &s;treets, and can vi&s;it each other during the plaque, with|out running the ri&s;k of catching the infection by going among the natives below.</P>
<P>There is a ca&s;tle in the city which I had nearly forgotten to mention&mdash;The natives conceive it to be a place of great &s;trength. It could not, how|ever, with&s;tand the &s;hock of a few pieces of ord|nance for a day. It is e&s;teemed a favour to be per|mitted to &s;ee it; and there is nothing to recom|pen&s;e one for the trouble of obtaining permi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s it be the pro&s;pect of the &s;urrounding coun|try, which from the battlements is exten&s;ive and beautiful.</P>
<P>Near this ca&s;tle &s;tands the &s;eraglio, a large old building, where the ba&s;haw of Aleppo re&s;ides: the whole of it &s;eemed to me to be kept in very bad repair, con&s;idering the importance of the place. It is &s;urrounded by a &s;trong wall of great height: be|&s;ides which, its contiguity to the ca&s;tle is very con|venient; as, in ca&s;e of popular tumults, or inte&s;tine commotions, the ba&s;haw finds an a&s;ylum in the latter, which commands and overawes the city, and is ne|ver without a numerous garri&s;on under the command of an Aga.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ummary account I have been able to collect of Aleppo, the capital of Syria; which, mean though it is when compared with the capitals of European countries, is certainly the third city for &s;plendour, magnificence, and importance, in the va&s;t extent of the Ottoman Empire&mdash;Con&s;tantinople and Grand Cairo only excelling it in tho&s;e points, and no other bearing any &s;ort of competition with it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER faction may agitate or abu&s;e irritate the minds of men again&s;t the executive branch of their government, the people of every nation under Heaven are di&s;po&s;ed to think their own con|&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem the be&s;t; and the artful intertexture of religion with governments confirms them in that opinion, and often con&s;igns the under&s;tanding to unalterable, error and illiberal prejudice. It would be wonderful, then, if the Turki&s;h con&s;titution, founded on the Koran, was not looked upon with abhorence by the bulk of the Chri&s;tian world; and more wonderful &s;till, if the outrageous zealots of the Chri&s;tian church, who for &s;o many centuries engro&s;&s;|ed all the learning of Europe to them&s;elves, &s;hould not have handed down with exaggerated mi&s;repre|&s;entation every circum&s;tance belonging to the great enemies of their faith. But that, at this day of in|tellectual illumination, mankind &s;hould be envelo|ped in &s;uch error and darkne&s;s, with regard to the government of &s;o large a portion of the globe as Turkey, is extraordinary; and only to be accounted for by a reference, in the fir&s;t place, to tho&s;e reli|gious prejudices which we &s;uck in from our nur&s;e, and which habit, ince&s;&s;ant document, and every part of our education, tend to confirm in our mind; and in the next, to that indi&s;po&s;ition the human mind feels to part with its old prejudices, and the general indolence and incapacity of men to acquire knowledge by the arduous and fatiguing paths of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h government is gro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly mi&s;repre&s;en|ted. Were our opinions to be directed by the gen|eral
<PB N="163" REF="033487_0162_0FF723ABF8B21578">
belief of Europeans, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the life and property of every being in that va&s;t em|pire were irremediably at the mercy of the Grand Seignior&mdash;and that, without laws to protect, or any intermediate power whatever to &s;hield them, they were entirely &s;ubject to the capricious will of an inexorable tyrant, who, &s;timulated by cruelty, &s;harpened by avarice, and unre&s;trained by any law human or divine, did every thing to oppre&s;s his &s;ubjects, and carry de&s;truction among mankind. I firmly believe, that, from the combination of ideas ari&s;ing from tho&s;e prejudices, there are few Chri&s;ti|ans who think or hear of the grand Turk, that do not, by an involuntary act of the mind, in&s;tantly think of blood and murder, &s;trangling with bow-&s;trings, and &s;licing off heads with cimeters.</P>
<P>As there is no part of your education more near my heart than the eradicating illiberal prejudices from your mind, and fortifying you again&s;t their a&s;&s;aults; I find it impo&s;&s;ible to refrain from giving you my opinion of the Turki&s;h government, which I have been at &s;ome pains to collect, as well from oral information as from the be&s;t authors; and which, though very far from what a generous and univer&s;ally philanthropic di&s;po&s;ition would wi&s;h them to have, is very different from that which is generally attributed to them, and unque&s;tionably far more limited in its powers than the governments of &s;everal Chri&s;tian countries I could mention.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of that country is laid down ex|pre&s;sly in the Koran. The emperor of Turkey (commonly called the Grand Seignior) is a de&s;cend|ant of Mahomet, who pretended he had the Koran from Heaven: and he is as much bound by the in|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tutes of that book as any &s;ubject in his realm&mdash;as liable to depo&s;ition as they to puni&s;hment for breach of them, and indeed has been more than once de|po&s;ed, and the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion rai&s;ed to the throne. Thus far, it is obvious, his power is
<PB N="164" REF="033487_0163_0FF723AD896AC058">
limited and under control. But that is not all&mdash;It is equally certain that the Turki&s;h government is partly republican; for, though the people at large have no &s;hare in the legi&s;lation, and are excluded by the Koran from it (which Koran has e&s;tabli&s;hed and preci&s;ely a&s;certained their rights, privileges, and per&s;onal &s;ecurity), yet there is an intermediate power which, when rou&s;ed to exertion, is &s;tronger than the Emperor's, and &s;tands as a bulwark be|tween the extremes of de&s;poti&s;m and them. This body is the ULAMA, compo&s;ed of all the members of the Church and the law, &s;uperior to any nobi|lity, jealous of their rights and privileges, and partly taken from the people, not by election, but by profe&s;&s;ion and talents.&mdash;In this body are com|pri&s;ed the Moulahs, the hereditary and perpetual guardians of the religion and laws of the empire: they derive their authority as much as the Emperor from the Koran, and, when nece&s;&s;ary, act with all the firmne&s;s re&s;ulting from a conviction of that au|thority; which they often demon&s;trate by oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures, not only with impunity, but &s;ucce&s;s. Their per&s;ons are &s;acred; and they can, by means of the unbounded re&s;pect in which they are held, rou&s;e the people to arms, and proceed to depo&s;e. But, what is much more, the Emperor cannot be depo&s;ed without their concurrence.</P>
<P>If, by this provi&s;ion of the con&s;titution, the power of the monarch is limited, and the per&s;onal &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject a&s;certained, on the one hand; the energy of the empire in its external operations is, on the other, very frequently and fatally pal&s;ied by it. Declarations of war have been procra&s;ti|nated, till an injurious and irrecoverable act of ho&s;|tility has been &s;u&s;tained; and peace often protract|ed, when peace would have been advantageous. The Ulama being a numerous body, it has been found always difficult, often impo&s;&s;ible, to unite &s;o many different opinions; and nothing being to
<PB N="165" REF="033487_0164_0FF723AF18045C78">
be done without their concurrence, the executive power finds it often impo&s;&s;ible to take a deci&s;ive &s;tep in a cri&s;is of advantageous opportunity. But as this code of laws and government is received as a divine revelation, binding both prince and peo|ple, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ealed in Heaven, the breach of it would be &s;ufficient to confign even the monarch to depo&s;ition and death.</P>
<P>As to the military force, which in the hands of all De&s;pots has been made the in&s;trument of the people's &s;lavery, that of the Turk could avail him nothing; and, whenever it does interfere, acts only to his overthrow. The very reverence they have for his per&s;on ari&s;ing from obedience to their religion, they are, <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> governed by it, not him. He holds no communication with them; and the &s;tanding force of the Jani&s;&s;aries is, com|pared with the ma&s;s of the people, only a handful. Some wild accounts, indeed, have &s;tated it at 300,000; but the be&s;t informed fix it below 60,000 of which a great part con&s;i&s;ts of fal&s;e mu&s;|ters and abu&s;es&mdash;great multitudes being enrolled to obtain certain privileges annexed to the office of Jani&s;&s;ary. The fact is, that the chief force of the empire is a militia compo&s;ed of the people; who, with re&s;pect to obedience and &s;ubordination, are &s;o loo&s;e that they leave their duty whenever they plea&s;e, without receiving any puni&s;hment. How far the people of Turkey are protected from the encroach|ments of power, will appear from the recital of a fact related by one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t liberal of our hi&s;torians on that &s;ubject, and which is of too great notoriety to be doubted.</P>
<P>In the year 1755, the Porte, as it is called, or Palace of the Grand Vizir at Con&s;tantinople, was burnt down: in laying the plan for rebuilding it on the former &s;ite, the leading con&s;ideration was, how to contrive matters &s;o as to render it &s;ecure from accidents of a like nature in future; and it
<PB N="166" REF="033487_0165_0FF723B2EA8FF730">
was determined that the only certain means to do &s;o was, to leave a &s;pace of clear ground all round it, for which purpo&s;e the contiguous hou&s;es &s;hould be purcha&s;ed from the proprietors, and demoli&s;hed. All the owners of the hou&s;es agreed to the &s;ale, except one old woman, who pertinaciou&s;ly refu&s;ed: &s;he &s;aid &s;he was born, and had lived all her life, in that &s;pot, and would not quit it for any one. Now, in England, for the convenience of a private canal, the Parliament would force her to &s;ell. But what did they &s;ay in Turkey? When all the people cried out, "Why does not the Sultan u&s;e his au|thority, and take the hou&s;e, and pay her the va|lue?" No! an&s;wered the magi&s;trates and the Ulama, it is impo&s;&s;ible! it cannot be done! it is her property. While the power of the monarch is thus limited, and the rights of the people thus a&s;certained by the Koran, and in things manife&s;t and open to view rigidly adhered to, ju&s;tice be|tween man and man is rarely admini&s;tered; for, though the laws them&s;elves are good, the corrupt admini&s;tration of them di&s;arms their effect, and di&s;torts them from their purpo&s;e. The venality of the judges is beyond conception flagitious and bare|faced; and their connivances at fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly habitual, that te&s;timony is become an article of commerce, and can be procured with a facility and at a price that at once &s;tamps an appro|brium on the country, and furni&s;hes matter of wonder to the con&s;iderate mind, how, if judges are flagitious and &s;hamele&s;s enough to be guilty of it, the people can bear &s;uch a pern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious &s;y&s;tem &s;o long.

This too I wi&s;h to impre&s;s on you, that the common people are more free, and that pro|perty and life are better &s;ecured, in Turkey, than in &s;ome European countries. I will mention Spain for one. Like the country we are now contempla|ting, fear keeps them, as di&s;united individuals, un|der pa&s;&s;ive obedience in ordinary ca&s;es; but, unlike the Spaniards, when notoriou&s;ly aggrieved: when their property or religious code is forcibly violated: when the prince would riot in blood, and per&s;i&s;t in an un&s;ucce&s;sful war: the Turks appeal to the law; they find a chief; the &s;oldiery join their &s;tandard, and depo&s;e or de&s;troy him, not on the fu|rious pretext of popular hatred, but upon the legiti|mate ground of the Koran, as an infidel, and a vio|lator of the laws of GOD and Mahomet&mdash;They al|ways, however, place his regular &s;ucce&s;&s;or on the throne.

<P>PREJUDICE, that canker of the hu|man heart, has injured mankind by impeding per|&s;onal intercour&s;e, and thereby clogging the channel of intellectual improvement: it forbids that inter|change

<P>Thus it is between the Turks and us&mdash;the little of their affairs which the prejudice of the Maho|medans have allowed them&s;elves to communicate, or &s;uffered others to glean among them, has been in general &s;o mi&s;u&s;ed, di&s;torted, and mi&s;repre&s;ented by the prejudices of the Chri&s;tians, that it is not going beyond the truth to &s;ay, there exi&s;t not a people in the civilized world who&s;e real hi&s;tory and genuine &s;tate are &s;o little known as tho&s;e of the Turks: and the wor&s;t of it is, that not one mi&s;repre&s;entation, not one &s;ingle mi&s;take has fallen on the generous, charitable &s;ide; but all, all with|out exception tend to repre&s;ent the Turk in the mo&s;t degraded and dete&s;table point of view. As the purity of the Chri&s;tian does not allow him to be guilty of a wilful, uncharitable mi&s;repre&s;entation, we &s;hould attribute it to unavoidable error, were it not that, till &s;ome late authors who&s;e liberality does them honour, they all walked in the very &s;ame track, and could hardly have been &s;o uniformly erroneous from de&s;ign. We mu&s;t therefore attri|bute it to religious zeal and mi&s;taken piety; in which, in this in&s;tance alone, they &s;eem to be reputable competitors with the Turks. The mo|ro&s;ene&s;s, the animo&s;ity, and the &s;upercilious &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

of the bigot, each holds in common with the other.</P>
<P>One &s;triking feature in the con&s;titution of Tur|key is, that neither blood nor &s;plendid birth are of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to recommend a man to great offices. Merit and abilities alone are the pinions which can lift ambition to its height. The cottager may be exalted to the highe&s;t office in the empire; at lea&s;t there is no ab&s;olute impediment in his way; and I believe it has often happened. Compare this with France under its late monarchy, where no merit could rai&s;e a man from the Canaille: this, I &s;ay, is one of the criterions of a free con&s;titution, and Turkey is &s;o far democratic.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t principle ingrafted in the minds of the Mahomedan children, is a high contempt of all religions but their own; and from the minute babes are capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, they are taught to call Chri&s;tians by the name of Ghiaour, or Infi|del: this grows up in their manhood &s;o &s;trong in them, that they will follow a Chri&s;tian through the &s;treets, and even ju&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t him with contempt, crying, Ghiaour! Ghiaour! or, Infidel! Infidel!&mdash; Men of dignity and rank, indeed, will treat Chri&s;|tians with courte&s;y; but as &s;oon as they are gone out of hearing, will call them dog! This is mon|&s;trous! But let us recollect how a Turk would be treated in Spain or Portugal, and we &s;hall &s;ee that inhuman bigotry may be found in a greater degree among Chri&s;tians than even Mahomedans. In Spain or Portugal they would treat them thus:&mdash;the com|mon people would call them hogs; they would ju&s;|tle them al&s;o in contempt; and what is more, they would &s;tab them (it has often happened) <HI>por amor de Dios;</HI> and as to the people of rank, they would very con&s;cientiou&s;ly con&s;ign them to the Inqui&s;i|tion, where the pious fathers of the church would very piou&s;ly con&s;ign them to the flames, and coolly go to the altar, and pray to GOD to damn them
<PB N="171" REF="033487_0170_0FF67BA81C985000">
hereafter to all eternity. So far the balance, I think, is in favour of the Turks. Need I go fur|ther?&mdash;I will.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Mahomedans are divided into two &s;ects, as the Chri&s;tians are into many. Tho&s;e are the &s;ect of Ali, and the &s;ect of Omar. Now, I have never heard among them of one &s;ect burning the other de|liberately: but the Roman Catholics, even now, burn Prote&s;tants by juridical &s;entence&mdash;burn their fellow Chri&s;tians to death for differing from them in a mere &s;peculative point of doctrine. Which then are the better men? I am &s;ure it is unnece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ay; though bad are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Turks are allowed, by tho&s;e who know them be&s;t, to have &s;ome excellent qualities; and I think, that in the prodigality of our cen&s;ure, which, tho' &s;tow acquainted with them, we are forward to be|little, it would be but fair to give them credit for many of tho&s;e good qualities, which even among our&s;elves it requires the greate&s;t intimacy and the warme&s;t mutual confidence and e&s;teem to di&s;clo&s;e or di&s;cover in each other. That they have many vices is certain. What people are they that have not? Gaming they dete&s;t; wine they u&s;e not, or at lea&s;t u&s;e only a little, and that by &s;tealth; and as to the plurality of women, it can in them be &s;carcely deemed a vice, &s;ince their religion allows it. One vice, and one only, of a dark dye is laid to their charge; and that has been trumpeted forth with the grievous and horrid addition, that though con|tradictory to nature, it was allowed by their reli|gion. This I have rea&s;on to believe is one of the many fabrications and artifices of Chri&s;tian zealots, to render Mahomedani&s;m more odious: for I have been informed from the mo&s;t competent and re|&s;pectable authority, and am therefore per&s;uaded, that the dete&s;table crime to which I allude, is forbidden both by the Koran and their municipal laws; that it is openly condemned by all, as with us; and
<PB N="172" REF="033487_0171_0FF67BADE78B6DA8">
that&punc; though candour mu&s;t allow there are many who practice it (by the bye there are too many in England w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o are &s;uppo&s;ed to do the &s;ame), there are none hardy or &s;hamele&s;s enough not to endea|vour to conceali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t; and, in &s;hort, that it is apparently as much reprobated there as any where; which, at all events, re&s;cues the laws and religion of the country from that &s;tigma.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no part of the world where the flame of parental affection burns with more ardent and unextingui&s;hable &s;trength, or is more faithfully returned by reciprocal tenderne&s;s and filial obedi|ence, than Turkey. Educated in the mo&s;t unaffect|ed deference and pious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their parents will; trained both by precept and example to the greate&s;t veneration for the aged, and &s;eparated al|mo&s;t from their infancy from the women, they ac|quire a mode&s;ty to their &s;uperiors, and a ba&s;hfulne&s;s and re&s;pectful deportment to the weaker &s;ex, which never cea&s;e to influence them through life. A Turk meeting a woman in the &s;treet, turns his head from her, as if looking at her were criminal: and there is nothing they dete&s;t &s;o much, or will more &s;edul|ou&s;ly &s;hun, than an impudent, audacious woman. To get the better of a Turk therefore, there is no|thing further nece&s;&s;ary, than to let &s;lip a virago at him, and he in&s;tantly retreats.</P>
<P>Since the arrival of the Turki&s;h amba&s;&s;ador in London, I have had frequent occa&s;&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the people of his train have been already, by the good example of our Briti&s;h belles and beaux, pretty much ea&s;ed of their national mode&s;ty, and can look at the women with as broad and intrepid a &s;tare, as the greate&s;t puppy in the metropolis.</P>
<P>Their habitual tenderne&s;s and deference for the fair &s;ex, while it &s;peaks much for their manly gal|lantry&punc; mu&s;t be allowed by candour to be carried to an exce&s;s extravagant and irrational. It is the greate&s;t di&s;grace to the character of a Turk to lift
<PB N="173" REF="033487_0172_0FF67BBA7B91B1E0">
his hand to a woman: this is, doubtle&s;s, right, with &s;ome limitations; but they carry it &s;o far as to allow no provocation, be it what it may, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify u&s;ing force or &s;trokes to a woman; the utmo&s;t they can do is, to &s;cold and walk off. The con&s;equence of this is, that the women often run into the mo&s;t violent exce&s;&s;es. There have been in&s;tances where they have been guilty of the mo&s;t furious outrages; where they have violated the laws in a collected body, and broke open public &s;tores of corn laid up by the government: the ma|gi&s;trates attended, the Jani&s;&s;aries were called, and came running to quell the riot&mdash;but, behold they were women who committed it: they knew no way of re&s;i&s;ting them, unle&s;s by force; and force they could not u&s;e: &s;o the ladies were permitted quietly to do their work in defiance of magi&s;trates, law, right, and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Among the variety of errors and moral ab&s;urdi|ties fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to the Mahomedan religion, the exclu&s;ion of women from Paradi&s;e holds a very con&s;picuous place, as a charge equally fal&s;e and ab|&s;urd; on the contrary, the women have their fa&s;ts, their ablutions, and the other religious rites deem|ed by Mahomedans nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Not|with&s;tanding, it has been the practice of travellers to have recour&s;e to invention, where the cu&s;toms of the country precluded po&s;itive information; and to give their accounts rather from the &s;ugge&s;ti|ons of their own prejudiced imagination, than from any fair inferences or conclu&s;ions drawn from the facts that came under their ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject I touched upon in my la&s;t three letters, and on which this, and probably &s;ome &s;ucceeding ones, will turn, is attended with cir|cum&s;tances of great delicacy, and may po&s;&s;ibly bear the a&s;pect of at lea&s;t a dubious import, as touching the great point of religion. I will therefore, be|fore I proceed further, explain to you (le&s;t it &s;hould require explanation) the whole &s;cope of my meaning.</P>
<P>My object throughout the whole of what I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the Turks, is to war with prejudice, not to draw compari&s;ons:&mdash;to &s;hew that where the Mahomedans are vicious or en&s;laved, it is not the fault of their religion or their laws:&mdash;to convince you, the Turks are not the only people in the world, who, under all the external forms of &s;ancti|ty and religion, are capable of the mo&s;t dete&s;table <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;ometimes, utterly be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eft of all pre|tentions to charity&mdash;and that, while they have been held up as a perpetual &s;ubject of reproach and ac|cu&s;ation, they were con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting only ju&s;t the &s;ame crimes that con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cience might have re&s;orted on their accu&s;ers.

And it mu&s;t be grievous to all men of virtue and religion to reflect,
<PB N="175" REF="033487_0174_0FF723C192528D40">
that churchmen, di&s;ciples of the Chri&s;tan church, which &s;hould be the fountain of purity and truth, have been foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of fal&s;ifiers.</P>
<P>The difficulty of obtaining information of any kind in Turkey, is very great; of their religion chiefly they are extremely tenacious; and as to their women, it is allowed by the be&s;t informed men, who have lived there for many years, in departments of life that gave them the be&s;t means of obtaining information Europeans can have, that, at be&s;t, but a very imperfect knowledge can be had of them. Yet travellers who probably never migrated farther than "from the green bed to the brown," have given us di&s;&s;u&s;e accounts of their religion; and adventurers who never were beyond the purlieus of Drury, have &s;caled Seraglio walls, and carried off the favo|rites of Sultans.</P>
<P>The truth is, my dear FREDERICK, the Turks, like all other people, have their &s;hare of vices, but are by no means countenanced in them by their re|ligion; and from what I have been able to collect, as well from my own inquiries and ob&s;ervations, as from reading the be&s;t hi&s;torians, I am per&s;uaded that they have not, in the whole &s;cope of Mahome|dani&s;m, one doctrine &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of virtue, or &s;o encouraging to the indulgence of vice, as many that are to be found in that curious code, Popery.</P>
<P>The malice of our intemperate zealots again&s;t Mahomedani&s;m has been of cour&s;e extended to its founder with more than common exaggeration and additions. They have repre&s;ented Mahomet to be a man of mean origin, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a mind unenlight|ened by &s;cience or literature, and an under&s;tanding and faculties naturally gro&s;s. All tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are undoubtedly fal&s;e;&mdash;he &s;prung from the mo&s;t noble of all the Arabian tribes&mdash;the Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hites: at his time, poverty, &s;o far from being a reproach among them, was a mark of every thing that was great and dignified, if &s;upported with magnanimity
<PB N="176" REF="033487_0175_0FF723C41B757EC8">
and fortitude; and the two fir&s;t caliphs lived as poor as Mahomet him&s;elf, although they had im|men&s;e revenues, commanded va&s;t armies, and were lords of great provinces. As to his under&s;tanding I can only &s;ay, that perhaps he was the very la&s;t man in the world who&s;e intellectual powers &s;hould be called in que&s;tion. His genius was unbounded, his &s;pirit enterpri&s;ing, his powers of addre&s;s were unequalled, he was allowed to be the greate&s;t ora|tor of his time; and yet, with all the&s;e qualifica|tions, his under&s;tanding was &s;lighted. It is a logi|cal truth, that when people prove too much, they prove nothing at all: our Chri&s;tian zealots, in this in&s;tance, have over&s;hot the mark, and thereby rendered all their other information at lea&s;t doubt|ful. Perhaps the con&s;ummation of all policy was Mahomet's pretending to be an idiot, in order to make his great and wonderful effu&s;ions appear to be the immediate in&s;piration of Heaven&mdash;He call|ed him&s;elf THE IDIOT PROPHET.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mohammed.</NOTE></P>
<P>The whole of Mahomedani&s;m may be reduced &s;imply to this one article of faith&mdash;"There is but one GOD, and MAHOMET is the prophet;" but upon this they have &s;uperinduced, from time to time, &s;uch a variety of ab&s;urdities as would require volumes to de&s;cribe: however, in &s;trict candour let us reflect, and a&s;k our own hearts the que&s;tion, whether &s;prinkling with holy water, or wor&s;hipping a bit of white wafer as GOD, can be exceeded, or are le&s;s ab&s;urd than the periodical ablutions of the Turks, or their going on a pilgrimage to Mecca?</P>
<P>With regard to the women, I have &s;aid before that the be&s;t information we can obtain is very im|porfect; all I have been able to collect, you &s;hall have. They are formed in a &s;tyle of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite &s;ymmetry, par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icularly about the che&s;t and bo&s;om; they have delicate &s;kins, regular features, black hair and eyes, and are, above all other beings,

cleanly and neat in their per&s;ons, bathing twice a day regularly, be&s;ides on other occa&s;ions, and not &s;ufferng even the &s;malle&s;t hair to remain upon their bodies. They are kept in the mo&s;t rigorous con|finement, and only per&s;ons of ill fame paint. Wo|men of character are there cha&s;te&mdash;nor is their cha&s;tity to be attributed to re&s;traint merely, for, from their infancy they are trained to di&s;cretion and &s;elf-&s;ubjection, and the mode&s;ty natural to the &s;ex is cheri&s;hed from its fir&s;t dawnings. When they grow up, they are not, like our women here, &s;ub|jected to the contagion of infamous gallantry; nei|ther are the men trained to, nor do they pride them&s;elves, like &s;ome among us, on the arts of &s;e|duction. In fact, that practice makes no part of the accompli&s;hments of their fine gentlemen; nay, it is held by them to be infamous. There are no &s;uch characters to be found in Turkey as your box-lobby loungers&mdash;none of your up&s;tart cubs like tho&s;e who doudle the be&s;t part of the day through Pall-Mall, St. James's-&s;treet and Bond-&s;treet; who, without birth, wealth, education, or parts, fancy them&s;elves fine fellows, and powder their no&s;es in ladies' head-dre&s;&s;es, whi&s;pering them in order to get the reputation of gallantry; who &s;trut like Bantam cocks, and a&s;&s;ume a fierce air to conceal their con|&s;cious want of &s;pirit; and dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of regi|mentals bought by papa, at mama's reque&s;t, to ex|hibit &s;weet Ma&s;ter Jacky to advantage in the Park&mdash; though never to be &s;oiled with gunpowder, or per|&s;onated with a ball in the na&s;ty field of battle!!!&mdash; my dear FREDERICK, I have often told you that you &s;hall make choice of your own profe&s;&s;ion. If you &s;hould choo&s;e any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, you may fail in it without di&s;honour; for many of the able&s;t men have failed before: but, mark me! avoid the military as you would ruin, unle&s;s you have the requi&s;ites; let not the glitter of a &s;carlet coat, or the empty name of a &s;oldier, tempt you to

be like one of tho&s;e mi&s;erable animals I have de|&s;cribed. There may be chara&s;ters more wicked&mdash;I know none &s;o utterly contemptible.</P>
<P>All extremes are bad; but the exceedings of virtue even where they run into error, are &s;till preferable to vice. However ludricous it may ap|pear, we cannot ab&s;olutely de&s;pi&s;e or condemn the prudery of the Turki&s;h women, though it runs into &s;uch extravagance, that, when feeding their poultry, they keep carefully vieled if there hap|pens to be a cock among them, &s;o fa&s;tidiou&s;ly aver&s;e are they to the odious male creature &s;eeing their pretty faces.</P>
<P>When the circum&s;tances under which the Tur|ki&s;h women &s;tand are con&s;idered, it mu&s;t appear amazing, that cha&s;tity, from principle, is univer&s;al among them, as it is confe&s;&s;ed to be: the nature of man urges him to de&s;ire, with greate&s;t ardour, that which is mo&s;t forbidden; and women who are much confined, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have their pa&s;|&s;ions inflamed by the exaggerated workings of the imagination. Infidelity, however, to the marriage-bed, is much le&s;s frequent among the men there, than among the women here; and the tide or fa&s;h|ion, which in this country gives &s;uch a rapid and irre&s;i&s;tible circulation to vice and adultery, runs there in an oppo&s;ite direction; and contrary to our cu&s;toms, no man is &s;o unfa&s;hionable in Turkey as he that has interrupttd the dome&s;tic peace of a fa|mily by &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Among the many virtues which may with &s;trict ju&s;tice be a&s;cribed to the Turks, ho&s;pitality holds a con&s;picuous place. It is not confined to common civility, it extends to per&s;onal protection. Many deem it ab&s;olutely their duty to ri&s;k their lives in defence of their gue&s;ts; nor will any motive, how|ever cogent, be allowed to ju&s;tify the violation of it. Nay, to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem is it carried up, that an engagement with a &s;tranger is accepted as an excu&s;e
<PB N="179" REF="033487_0178_0FF723CE9378E4D0">
for not obeying the &s;ummons of a great man, when no other apology, not even that of indi&s;po&s;ition, would be admitted.</P>
<P>While the Turks abhor and de&s;pi&s;e all other re|ligions but their own, their government is by no means intolerant in &s;piritual concerns. The exer|ci&s;e of all religions is free, and at Con&s;tantinople (we are told) Monks dre&s;s in their habits, and are allowed at funeral proce&s;&s;ions to elevate the cro&s;s, which is more than the Engli&s;h tyranny allowed the Roman Catholics of Ireland to do, till very lately: a Turk, however, convicted of apo&s;tacy, could not by any means e&s;cape death. Meantime it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that if they keep up a decent &s;emblance of the forms of their religion, no intru|&s;ive inquiry is made unto their real faith: and though it is one of the injunctions of Mahomet to endeavour to convert unbelievers, and they &s;ome|times in obedience to that command &s;olicit the con|ver&s;ion of Chri&s;tians and others; they never &s;ail to con&s;ider any renegado, or per&s;on who becomes a convert, with contempt, if not di&s;like.</P>
<P>I will conclude this letter with an extract from that mo&s;t valuable and accurate work, Ru&s;&s;el's Hi&s;t|ory of Aleppo, which will give you a better, be|cau&s;e a true, notion of Turki&s;h morals, than you are likely to receive from general opinion. "Up|on the whole," &s;ays he, "whether it be a&s;cribed to the influence of their political con&s;titution, or to the ab&s;ence of various temptations, which in Eu|rope often lead to the violation of better laws; there are perhaps few great cities where many of the private and dome&s;tic virtues are in general more prevalent than at Aleppo."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;e of periodical &s;tated times of de|votion is univer&s;ally admitted, and the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting them makes a part of the Chri&s;tian code. The Mahomedan religion, however, exceeds it far in the rigid attention to, and frequency of, de|votion. There are no le&s;s than five &s;tated times of prayer in every twenty-four hours, fixed as in|di&s;pen&s;able, at none of which a true believer fails; and the fervency of their praying exceeds even the frequency. I have heard it a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted, that if the hou&s;e was to take fire while they are at their devo|tion, they would not break off; and &s;o rigidly in|tent do they conceive it their duty to be during the time of prayer, that if in the mid&s;t of it they were interrupted by a fit of &s;neering or coughing, they con&s;ider all already done as gone for nothing, and always begin them again. And to tell a truth of them, if the Chri&s;tian cur&s;e them, they are pret|ty even with them in return, never failing to pray for di&s;cord, enmity, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion among their enemies, as well as health and pro&s;perity to them|&s;elves; and to the efficacy of tho&s;e prayers they fondly attribute all the wars and di&s;&s;en&s;ions which ince&s;&s;antly hara&s;s Chri&s;tendom. A bell tolls as a public notice of prayer; and when a true Mahome|dan hears it, let him be where he will, whether at home or abroad, in the highway or in the market, be the place dirty or clean, wet or dry, he imme|ditely falls down and wor&s;hips.</P>
<P>As &s;ub&s;idiary to prayer they have their ablutions, in which they are full as &s;crupulou&s;ly punctual as in their prayers. One is preparatory to prayer, another
<PB N="181" REF="033487_0180_0FF723D3006F57E8">
after cohabitation with women, a third before e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing, and another again incidental. Tho&s;e they never neglect to perform, unle&s;s &s;ome in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle lies in the way. Charity, that mo&s;t glo|rious doctrine of any religion, is enjoined by the Koran under the mo&s;t heavy denunciation of hea|venly vengeance, in ca&s;e of neglect; and by it they are charged to regard no bounds in liberality to the poor. Many Mu&s;&s;ulmen in their zeal to di&s;charge this duty have given a fourth, many a third, and &s;ome one half of their property. Nay, the in&s;tances are not unfrequent of men giving away their all, and living afterwards them&s;elves upon alms. To do &s;trict ju&s;tice it mo&s;t be &s;aid, that poverty is no where &s;o re&s;pectfully attended to, honoured, or reverenced, as among the Mahome|dans; who have a &s;aying among them, "that the fear of want is a mark of the judgment of GOD."</P>
<P>Ab&s;tinence is con&s;idered as a virtue among them, and very &s;trictly enjoined as a religious duty. The great fa&s;t appointed by the Koran continues for the month of Ramedan, during which time they nei|ther eat, drink, nor conver&s;e with their wives, from &s;un-ri&s;e till the &s;tars appear, or the lamps are hung out at the mo&s;ques. Any man who breaks it is puni&s;hed with death; but the wor&s;t of it is, that they will not allow even travellers, the &s;ick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wounded, to plead a right to exemption: &s;ome of the Turks, however, and all the Chri&s;tians, have hit upon expedients to pa&s;s the month without much mortification; that is, &s;leeping in bed all day, and &s;itting up and carou&s;ing all night, to evade the re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and greate&s;t ordinance of their religion is the pilgrimage to Mecca, which when once ac|compli&s;hed is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a dire&s;t pa&s;&s;port to Heaven; and there are few of them who do not at one time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other of their lives take that painful and hazardous journey. As this is a very intere&s;t|ing
<PB N="182" REF="033487_0181_0FF723D5CC777B88">
journey, however, to travel in the clo&s;et, as it includes the de&s;cription of a caravan, and &s;erves to &s;hew to what extremeties enthu&s;ia&s;m can influence men, I will give you a de&s;cription of it as handed to me by a very accurate and ingenious per&s;on, on who&s;e preci&s;e veracity I can rely; fir&s;t making &s;ome remarks upon the preceding part of this letter.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve from what I have already &s;aid, that, excepting the mere points of religious faith, the moral ordinances of Mahomedani&s;m compre|hend mo&s;t of tho&s;e parts of the Chri&s;tian religion, on the practice of which the reputation of piety is founded; and that for &s;trict obedience to tho&s;e ordinances the Mahomedans are more remarkable than we are. Adultery is not frequent among them; wine is &s;eldom or never u&s;ed; theft is little known; &s;o is murder. Then in the practical parts of devotion, there are in the fir&s;t place prayers; &s;econdly, ab&s;tinence or fa&s;ting; thirdly, charity. Tho&s;e are all Chri&s;tian doctrines, more zealou&s;ly ob&s;erved by them than by us. Their ablutions are at lea&s;t no injury to the cau&s;e of morality or piety; but rather, being done as a religious exerci&s;e, &s;erve to keep up the &s;eries of intercour&s;e which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the creature and his Creator: be|&s;ides, I cannot help thinking with our inimitable poet Thom&s;on, that
<Q><L>&mdash;from the body's purity, the mind</L>
<L>Receives a &s;ecret &s;ympathetic aid. SEASONS&mdash;Summer.</L></Q>
And as to the pilgrimage to Mecca, however irra|tional it may appear to us, it is at lea&s;t recommended by &s;incerity and zeal, and is doubtle&s;s in the eye of an all-&s;eeing Providence meritorious. HE, we are to &s;uppo&s;e, will judge, not by the value of the act, but the purity of the motive; and will accept it as the offering of a frail, blind mortal, bending in obedience to that which he conceives to be the will of Heaven. Be&s;ides, for the life of me I cannot &s;ee why a pilgrimage to Mecca is at all more culpa|ble
<PB N="183" REF="033487_0182_0FF723D882F20F10">
than a pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem; not to mention the thou&s;and other holy places to which well-mean|ing Chri&s;tians go, for their &s;oul's &s;ake, at imminent hazard of their lives, and certain mortification and hard&s;hip to their bodies.</P>
<P>Bani&s;h then, my FREDERICK! bani&s;h from your heart all illiberal and uncharitable prejudices, if any have yet found their way to it. Revere and cling to your religion as the be&s;t and mo&s;t conducive to eternal and temporal happine&s;s; and the more good becau&s;e it enjoins us to be charitable even to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles: but never think that you advance the cau&s;e of that religion, or do &s;ervice to your GOD, by waging war again&s;t your fellow-creatures for opinions they can no more help entertaining than you can help having yours, or by denouncing again&s;t them that eternal &s;entence which re&s;ts with the Almighty alone to judge of or to pro|nounce.</P>
<P>To a benevolent mind the animo&s;ities of mankind pre&s;ent a mo&s;t afflicting picture&punc; and the frivolous pretexts upon which tho&s;e animo&s;ities are grounded render it only the more horrible. One would think that the &s;ub&s;tantial traffic of life, and the &s;truggle of mankind for the &s;uperfluities of it, of them&s;elves afforded ample materials for &s;cuffle, without re&s;ort|ing to the &s;hadows of &s;peculation for contention. Yet experience has &s;hewn us that opinion is a much more copious &s;ource of animo&s;ity and warfare; and that for one man who has been cur&s;ed, murdered, or de&s;troyed by his fellow-creatures in a conte&s;t for property, there are a thou&s;and who have fallen &s;a|crifices to the vengeance of ho&s;tile opinion.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible that I could obtain from the bounty of Heaven a grant of the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, that wi&s;h &s;hould be to &s;ee all mankind in harmony and mutual good will, ranging without di&s;tinction under the one great name of man and brother. As tho&s;e who foment the di&s;union be|tween
<PB N="184" REF="033487_0183_0FF723DBA0037AF8">
them are the mo&s;t pernicious mon&s;ters of &s;ociety, &s;o he who endeavours to bring them one &s;tep nearer to a general accommodation of &s;entiment, who &s;trives to inculcate the principles of mutual toleration, and encourage the growth of reciprocal affection between men as fellow beings, may be ju&s;tly ranked among the be&s;t friends of mankind, and the mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants of Him who gave being to all.</P>
<P>Among the gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of which I complain, and which for the &s;ake of mankind I lament, is that general fal&s;ehood, the infidelity of the Turki&s;h women. The re&s;pectable author whom I have before taken the freedom of quoting, I mean Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, declares that in twenty years re|&s;idence at Aleppo, he did not remember a public in&s;tance of adultery; and that in the private walks of &s;candal tho&s;e he heard of were among the low|e&s;t cla&s;s, and did not in number exceed a dozen. "In re&s;pect to the Franks (continues he) the un|dertaking is attended not only with &s;uch ri&s;k to the individual, but may in its con&s;equences &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly involve the whole &s;ettlement, that it is either ne|ver attempted, or is concealed with a &s;ecrecy un|exampled in other matters. I have rea&s;on to be|lieve that European travellers have &s;ometimes had a Greek courte&s;an impo&s;ed on them for a &s;ultana; and after having been heartily frightened, have been induced to pay &s;martly, in order to pre&s;erve a &s;ecret which the day after was known to half the &s;i&s;terhood in town." He remarks, however, that at Con&s;tantinople the &s;tate of gallantry is different.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the Turki&s;h moral character, I have endeavoured to be as conci&s;e as ju&s;tice would allow me to be; and yet I find that I have gone to &s;ome length. I cannot however di&s;mi&s;s it without giving you a trait to which the mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate polemical prejudice, and the mo&s;t inveterate hatred, mu&s;t in &s;pite of them pay the tribute of
<PB N="185" REF="033487_0184_0FF723DEC7FAFFD0">
applau&s;e. Their treatment to their &s;laves is beyond all example among us humane, tender, and gene|rous, and &s;uch as may well bring a blu&s;h into the faces of Chri&s;tian dealers in human fle&s;h. When young &s;laves, male or female, are bought by a Turk, they &s;eem to be introduced into the family rather in the condition of an adopted child; they receive the &s;ame education, perform nearly the &s;ame offices, and are bound to no greater marks of re&s;pect than their ma&s;ter's own children&mdash;and in fact feel none of the galling circum&s;tances of a &s;tate of &s;ervility; the very wor&s;t treatment they ever re|ceive is to be put on a footing with the menial do|me&s;tics, or ordered to the &s;ame duty as a valet or a page. It often happens, on the other hand, that they are married into the family, and very fre|quently are promoted to high offices in the &s;tate. If they adopt the religion of their ma&s;ters, it is always &s;pontaneou&s;ly; and even to &s;laves taken in war, no compul&s;ion is u&s;ed to make them change their faith.</P>
<P>The following is the be&s;t de&s;cription I am able to give you of an Ea&s;tern caravan. It exactly co|incides with my own ob&s;ervations, and with the various accounts I have had from others. I owe it, as well as the account of the proceedings of the pilgrims at Mecca, to the kind offices of a friend, who took the pains to procure them for me.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A CARAVAN. <HI>Inclo&s;ed in the preceding Letter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A CARAVAN, which is &s;o often mentioned in the hi&s;tory and de&s;cription of the Ea&s;t, and in all the tales and &s;tories of tho&s;e countries, is an a&s;&s;em|blage of travellers, partly pilgrims, partly merchants, who collect together in order to con&s;olidate a &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="186" REF="033487_0185_0FF723E059B31A00">
force to protect them, in travelling through the hideous wilds and burning de&s;erts over which they are con&s;trained to pa&s;s for commercial and other purpo&s;es; tho&s;e wilds being infe&s;ted with Arabs, who make a profe&s;&s;ion of pillage, and rob in mo&s;t formidable bodies, &s;ome almo&s;t as large as &s;mall armies. As the collection of &s;uch a number requires time, and the embodying of them is a &s;eri|ous concern, it is concerted with great care and preparation, and is never attempted without the permi&s;&s;ion of the prince in who&s;e dominions it is to be formed, and of tho&s;e al&s;o through who&s;e do|minions it is to pa&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed in writing. The exact number of men and carriages, mules, hor&s;es, and other bea&s;ts of burthen, are &s;pecified in the licen&s;e; and the merchants to whom the caravan belongs, regulate and direct every thing appertain|ing to its government and police during the journey, and appoint the various officers nece&s;&s;ary for con|ducting it.</P>
<P>Each caravan has four principal officers: the fir&s;t, the caravanbachi, or head of the caravan; the &s;e|cond, the captain of the march; the third, the captain of the &s;top or re&s;t; and the fourth, the captain of the di&s;tribution. The fir&s;t has the un|controlable authority and command over all the others, and gives, them his orders: the &s;econd is ab&s;olute during the march; but his authority imme|diately cea&s;es on the &s;topping or encamping of the caravan, when the third a&s;&s;umes his &s;hare of the authority, and exerts it during the time of its re|maining at re&s;t: and the fourth orders the di&s;po&s;i|tion of every part of the caravan, in ca&s;e of an attack or battle. This la&s;t officer has al&s;o during the march the in&s;pection and direction of the di&s;|tribution of provi&s;ions, which is conducted under his management by &s;everal inferior officers, who are obliged to give &s;ecurity to the ma&s;ter of the cara|van; each of them having the care of a certain
<PB N="187" REF="033487_0186_0FF723E20F35E7D8">
number of men, elephants, dromedaries, camels, &amp;c. &amp;c. which they undertake to conduct and fur|ni&s;h with provi&s;ions at their own ri&s;que, accord|ing to an agreement &s;tipulated between them.</P>
<P>A fifth officer of the caravan is the pay-ma&s;ter or trea&s;urer, who has under him a great many clerks and interpreters, appointed to keep accurate jour|nals of all the material incidents that occur upon the journey. And it is by the&s;e journals, &s;igned by the &s;uperior officers, that the owners of the ca|ravan judge whether they have been well or ill &s;erved or conducted.</P>
<P>Another kind of officers are the mathematicians, without whom no caravan will pre&s;ume to &s;et out. There are commonly three of them attached to a ca|ravan of large &s;ize; and they perform the offices both of quarter-ma&s;ters and aides-de-camp, leading the troops when the caravan is attacked, and a&s;&s;ign|ing the quarters where the caravan is appointed to encamp.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than five di&s;tinct &s;orts of cara|vans; fir&s;t, the heavy caravans, which are compo&s;|ed of elephants, dromedaries, camels and hor&s;es; &s;econdly, the light caravans, which have but few elephants; thirdly, the common caravans, where there are none of tho&s;e animals; fourthly the hor&s;e caravans, where there are neither dromedaries nor camels; and la&s;tly, &s;ea caravans, con&s;i&s;ting of ve&s;|&s;els; from whence you will ob&s;erve that the word caravan is not confined to the land, but extends to the water al&s;o.</P>
<P>The proportion ob&s;erved in the heavy caravan is as follows: When there are five hundred ele|phants, they add a thou&s;and dromedaries and two thou&s;and hor&s;es at the lea&s;t: and then the e&s;cort is compo&s;ed of four thou&s;and men on hor&s;eback. Two men are required for leading one elephant, five for three dromedaries, and &s;even for eleven cam|els. This multitude of &s;ervants, together with the
<PB N="188" REF="033487_0187_0FF723E965A89830">
officers and pa&s;&s;engers, who&s;e number is uncertain, &s;erve to &s;upport the e&s;cort in ca&s;e of a fight, and render the caravan more formidable and &s;ecure. The pa&s;&s;engers are not ab&s;olutely obliged to fight; but according to the laws and u&s;ages of the caravans, if they refu&s;e to do &s;o, they are not entitled to any provi&s;ions whatever from the caravan, even though they &s;hould agree to pay an extravagant price for them.</P>
<P>Every elephant is mounted by what they call a nick: that is to &s;ay, a young lad of nine or ten years old, brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s, who drives the elephant, and pricks it with a pointed iron to animate it in the fight: the &s;ame lad al&s;o loads the fire-arms of the two &s;oldiers who mount the ele|phant, with him.</P>
<P>The day of the caravan &s;etting out being once fixed, is never altered or po&s;tponed&punc; &s;o that no di&s;appointment can po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue to any one.</P>
<P>One would &s;uppo&s;e that &s;o enormous and power|ful a body, &s;o well armed, might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of mov|ing forward without fear of being robbed: but as mo&s;t of the Arabian princes have no other means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t but by their robberies, they keep &s;pies in all parts, who give them notice when the cara|vans &s;et out, which they way lay; and &s;ometimes attack with &s;uperior force, overpower them, plun|der them of all their trea&s;ure, and make &s;laves of the whole convoy&mdash;foreigners excepted, to whom they generally &s;hew more mercy. If they are re|pul&s;ed, they generally come to &s;ome agreement; the conditions of which are pretty well ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially if the a&s;&s;ailants are native Arabians. The carrying on of robberies with &s;uch armies may ap|pear a&s;toni&s;hing; but when the temptation is con|&s;idered, and when it is known that one caravan only is &s;ometimes enough to enrich tho&s;e princes, much of our &s;urpri&s;e vani&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="033487_0188_0FF67BA637170AE8">They are obliged to u&s;e great precautions to pre|vent the caravan from introducing that dreadful di&s;temper, the plague, into the places through which they pa&s;s, or from being them&s;elves infected with it. When therefore they arrive near a town, the inhabitants of the town and the people of the ca|ravan hold a &s;olemn conference concerning the &s;tate of their health, and very &s;incerely communi|cate to each other the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, candidly informing each other whether there be danger on either &s;ide.&mdash;When there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any contagious di&s;temper, they amicably agree that no communication whatever &s;hall take place between them; and if the caravan &s;tands in need of provi|&s;ions, they are conveyed to them with the utmo&s;t caution over the walls of the town.</P>
<P>The fatigues, hard&s;hips, and hazards, attending tho&s;e caravans, are &s;o great, that they certainly would never be undertaken, if the amazing profits did not in &s;ome mea&s;ure counterbalance them.&mdash; The merchant who travels in them mu&s;t be con|tent with &s;uch provi&s;ions as he can get, mu&s;t part with all his delicacies, and give up all hope of ea&s;e; he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the frightful confu&s;ion of lan|guages and nations; the fatigues of long marches over &s;ands, and under a climate almo&s;t &s;ufficiently hot to reduce him to a cinder: he mu&s;t &s;ubmit cheerfully to exorbitant duties fraudulently levied, and audacious robberies and &s;ubtle tricks practi&s;ed by the herd of vagabonds who follow the caravans &mdash;for preventing which, the merchants have a va|riety of well contrived locks, that can only be opened by tho&s;e who know the knack of them.</P>
<P>But in &s;ome tracks of caravans there are dangers, and horrible ones again&s;t which no human fore&s;ight or power can provide, and beneath which whole caravans &s;ink, and are never after heard of.</P>
<P>The Egyptian caravans are particularly &s;ubject to hazards in the horrid tracks they are nece&s;&s;arily

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF THE CEREMONIES OBSERVED BY PILGRIMS ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT MECCA.</HEAD>
<P>The caravans are generally &s;o ordered, as to arrive at Mecca about forty days after the Fa&s;t of Ramedan, and immediately previous to the Corban, or Great Sacrifice. Five or &s;ix days before that fe&s;tival, the three great caravans, viz. that from Europe, that from A&s;ia Minor, and that from Arabia, unite; and all, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred thou&s;and men, and three hundred thou&s;and bea&s;ts of burthen, en|camp at &s;ome miles from Mecca. The pilgrims form them&s;elves into &s;mall detachments, and enter the town to arrange the ceremonies preparatory to the Great Sacrifice. They are led through a &s;treet of continual a&s;cent, till they arrive at a gate on an eminence, called the Gate of Health. From thence they &s;ee the great mo&s;que which inclo&s;es the Hou&s;e of Abraham. They &s;alute it with the mo&s;t pro|found re&s;pect and devotion, repeating twice, "Sa|lam Alek Iru&s;oul Allah!" that is to &s;ay, "Peace be with the Amba&s;&s;ador of God!" Thence, at &s;ome di&s;tance, they mount five &s;teps to a large platform faced with &s;tone, where they offer up then pray|ers; they then de&s;cend on the other &s;ide of it, and advance towards two arches, of the &s;ame kind of dimen&s;ions, but at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, through which they pa&s;s with great &s;ilence and devotion. This ceremony mu&s;t be performed &s;e|ven times.</P>
<P>From hence proceeding to the great mo&s;que which inclo&s;es the Hou&s;e of Abraham, they enter the mo&s;que, and walk &s;even times round the little building contained within it, &s;aying, "This is the Hou&s;e of GOD, and of his &s;ervant Abraham." Then ki&s;&s;ing with great veneration a black &s;tone, &s;aid to have de&s;cended white from Heaven, they go to the famous well called Zun Zun, which the angel

&s;hewed to Hagar when &s;he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the de|&s;ert, and could find no water for her &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I&s;hmael, and which the Arabs call Zem Zem. Into this well they plunge with all their clothes, repeating "Toba Alla, Toba Alla!" that is to &s;ay, "For|givene&s;s, GOD! Forgivene&s;s, GOD!" They drink a draught of that foe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id, turbid water, and depart.</P>
<P>The duty of bathing and drinking they are oblig|ed to pa&s;s through once; but tho&s;e who would gain Paradi&s;e bofore the others, mu&s;t repeat it once a day during the &s;tay of the caravan at Mecca.</P>
<P>At fifteen miles from the town of Mecca there is a hill called "Ghiabal Arafata," or "the Mount of Forgivene&s;s." It is about two miles in circum|ference&mdash;a mo&s;t delicious &s;pot. On it ADAM and EVE met, after the LORD had, for their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, &s;eparated them forty years. Here they cohabited and lived in exce&s;s of happine&s;s, having built a hou&s;e on it, called "Beith Adam," that is to &s;ay, "the Hou&s;e of Adam." On the eve of the day of Sacrifice, the three caravans, ranged in a triangular form, &s;urround this mountain&mdash;during the whole night the people rejoice, clamour, and riot&mdash;firing off cannon, mu&s;kets, pi&s;tols, and fire|works, with an ince&s;&s;ant &s;ound of drums and trum|pets. As &s;oon as day breaks, a profound &s;ilence &s;ucceeds&mdash;they &s;lay their &s;heep and offer up their &s;acrifice on the mountain with every demon&s;tration of the mo&s;t profound devotion.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden a &s;cheik (or head of the temple), a kind of prelate, ru&s;hes from amid&s;t them, mounted on a camel&mdash;he a&s;cends five &s;teps, rendered practi|cable for the purpo&s;e, and in a &s;tudied &s;ermon preaches thus to the people:</P>
<P>"Return prai&s;e and thanks for the infinite and immen&s;e benefits granted by GOD to Mahomedars, through the mediation of his mo&s;t beloved friend and prophet, Mahomet: for that he has delivered them from the &s;lavery and bondage of &s;in and ido|latry,

in which they were plunged; has given them the Hou&s;e of Abraham, from whence they can be heard, and their petitions granted; al&s;o the moun|tain of forgivene&s;s, by which they can implore Him, and obtain a pardon and remi&s;&s;ion of all their &s;ins.</P>
<P>"For that the ble&s;&s;ed, pious, and merciful GOD, giver of all good gifts, commanded his &s;ecretary, Abraham, to build him&s;elf a hou&s;e at Mecca, whence his de&s;cendants might pray to the Almighty, and their de&s;ires be fulfilled.</P>
<P>"On this command all the mountains in the world ran, as it were, each ambitious to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ecretary of the LORD, and to furni&s;h a &s;tone to|wards erecting the holy hou&s;e; all, except this poor little mountain, which, through mere indi|gence, could not contribute a &s;tone. It continued therefore thirty years grievou&s;ly afflicted: at length the Eternal God ob&s;erved its angui&s;h, and, moved with pity at its long &s;uffering, broke forth, &s;aying, I can forbear no longer, my child! your bitter la|mentations have reached my ears; and I now de|clare, that all tho&s;e who go to vi&s;it the hou&s;e of my friend Abraham &s;hall not be ab&s;olved of their &s;ins, if they do not fir&s;t reverence you, and celebrate on you the holy Sacrifice, which I have enjoined my people through the mouth of my prophet Maho|met! Love God! Pray! Give Alms!"</P>
<P>After this &s;ermon the people &s;alute the Moun|tain, and depart.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t letters I endeavoured to give you an account of the Turki&s;h government, laws,
<PB N="195" REF="033487_0194_0FF723FB6AEC0980">
and con&s;titution in general, &s;o far as I was able to collect information on the &s;ubject. I will now proceed to a de&s;cription of tho&s;e particular parts of that va&s;t empire through which I had occa&s;ion to travel.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at Aleppo, I experienced much politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality from the European gen|try re&s;ident there, and particularly from Mr. &mdash;, at who&s;e hou&s;e I entirely re&s;ided; and as the Franks live on a very good footing with each other, the time pa&s;&s;ed &s;o agreeably, that were it not for "that within," I &s;hould have been happy enough &mdash;We rode out occa&s;ionally, &s;ometimes hunting, &s;ometimes merely for the ride &s;ake. Sometimes with an intelligent native whom I got to walk with me, or with &s;ome of the Franks, I walked about the town, in order to amu&s;e away the time and &s;ee what was going forward, notwith&s;tanding the cry of "Frangi Cucu!" or "Cuckold Frank!" which frequently followed us for the length of a &s;treet. Sometimes we went of evenings to &s;ome of the outlets, where preperation was made for our recep|tion by &s;ervants, previou&s;ly di&s;patched for the purpo&s;e, and there regaled with coffee, wine, fruits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day we went on a party of the la&s;t men|tioned kind, Mrs. &mdash; did us the honour to ac|company us: the place appointed was in a range of beautiful rural gardens that lie along the &s;ide of a river; where the well cultivated earth teeming with a va&s;t abundance of the be&s;t e&s;culent plants, flow|ers, flowering &s;hrubs and fruit-trees, afforded a mo&s;t delicious regale to the &s;en&s;es; and the plane, the willow, the a&s;h, the pomegranate, and a variety of other trees, clu&s;tered together in almo&s;t impervious thickets, yielded a delightful &s;hady retreat from the piercing rays of the &s;un. It was on this occa|&s;ion that I got the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of Turki&s;h illibe|rality, which, as I was entirely unprepared for it
<PB N="196" REF="033487_0195_0FF7240047614070">
confounded me, and nearly deprived me of temper and of prudence. As we walked along, I ob&s;erved &s;everal Turks addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to Mrs. &mdash; and me, who walked arm in arm, and &s;peaking with a loudne&s;s of voice, contortion of countenance, and violence of ge&s;ticulation, attended with a clap|pling of hands, which, though I did not under&s;tand their language, I could plainly perceive carried the appearance of a menace or in&s;ult. I was at a lo&s;s what to think of it: Mrs. &mdash; blu&s;hed, and &s;eemed much hurt: Mr. &mdash; and the other gen|tlemen were &s;ilent, and betrayed not the lea&s;t mark of emotion or re&s;entment. At length, when we got from them, I a&s;ked what it meant? and was told, that it was all aimed at Mrs. &mdash;, or at lea&s;t occa&s;ioned by her: that, bigoted to the cu&s;toms of their own country, and utterly ignorant of tho&s;e of any other, they were affected with great indigna|tion at her dre&s;s, occa&s;ional derangement of her veil, and, above all, at the &s;hamele&s;s and unpardon|ably wicked circum&s;tance of a woman walking &s;o openly and familiarly in the company of men.&mdash; Talking of this affair afterwards with Mr. &mdash;, the lady's hu&s;band, he a&s;&s;ured me, that there was not an opprobrious and infamous epithet which the vulgar ingenuity of the brighte&s;t que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in Billings-gate could think of, that they had not huddled up|on us. I was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hed at the coolne&s;s with which he bore it, and &s;aid, that if I had under&s;tood what they had &s;aid, I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have been unable to re&s;train my&s;elf, and would have knocked one of them down as an ex|ample to the re&s;t. Had you done &s;o, returned he, you would certainly have repented it: for, if you e&s;caped being &s;toned, or put to death upon the &s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the legal puni&s;hment for an infidel &s;triking a true believer, you could not e&s;cape; and probably we, and all the Franks in the city, would &s;uffer for it: it would at all events cau&s;e a dreadful convul&s;ion

in the place, and you would your&s;elf fall a &s;acrifice to it.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince I was conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject with a gentleman of my acquaintance, and menti|oned it with &s;ome a&s;perity, as ari&s;ing from a &s;pirit of bigotry peculiar to Mahomedans. "My good Sir," &s;aid he, "let me undeceive you! the very &s;ame would be done in mo&s;t parts of Spain. I was one day," continued he, "walking in a town in Spain, in company with the wife of a gentleman who re&s;ided there, who were both well known, and bore the mo&s;t unexceptionable character. See|ing me however walking with her, the populace, as we pa&s;&s;ed, held up two fingers &s;ignificantly, and cried to her, What a cuckold is your hu&s;band! and concluded with 'Todas las Ingle&s;as &s;on putas,' or, "All Engli&s;h women are &mdash;s." He added, "that he was even in Cadiz, where commercial in|tercour&s;e renders them rather more liberal than in other part of the country, frequently acco&s;ted by little children them&s;elves, with 'Crees in Dios?' Do you believe in God? and &s;ometimes forming a cro&s;s with the thumb of the right hand and the forefinger, 'Crees en e&s;te? Crees en e&s;te? No! No! Ah Judio! Moro! Barbaro! Bruto! Pro|te&s;tante! Puerco! Voia al los Infernos!!' In Engli&s;h&mdash;Do you believe in this? Do you believe in this? No! No! Ah Jew! Moor! Barbarian! Prote&s;tant! Hog! Go to Hell!!"</P>
<P>So much for human beneficience and charity, under the fo&s;tering au&s;pices of religion!</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Mr. &mdash;, where I was &s;o ho&s;|pitably lodged, was a magnificent edifice, built in all the fulne&s;s of Ea&s;tern grandeur and luxury, and furni&s;hed with all the &s;plendour and &s;tate of Tur|key, united with the ta&s;te and opulence of Great Britain. It was indeed a hou&s;e in which voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;t it&s;elf might &s;it down with &s;atisfaction&mdash;The mo&s;t unaffected ho&s;pitality and generous benevo|lence
<PB N="198" REF="033487_0197_0FF724037748F828">
&s;pread the board, and politene&s;s and affability pre&s;ided over all. Never &s;hall I forget it&mdash;never &s;hall I think of it without gratitude and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>A gentleman of the opulence and con&s;equence of Mr. &mdash;, with a hou&s;e &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ocial enjoyment, was not, you will conclude, without a re&s;ort of company and friends; in truth, he had friends even among the better &s;ort of Turks. Parties of plea&s;ure had no in|termi&s;&s;ion while I was there; and as the ladies of Europe or of European extraction in that country are highly accompli&s;hed, &s;peak many languages, are indefatigable in their efforts to plea&s;e, and receive &s;trangers from Europe with a joy and &s;atisfaction not to be de&s;cribed, Aleppo would have been to me an Ely&s;ium, if the plea&s;ures of the place did not from the beginning &s;uffer diminution from my own painful &s;en&s;ations, which were aggravated at la&s;t by an incident that aro&s;e from my intercour&s;e there&mdash; of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>While I remained at Aleppo, I walked as I be|fore told you, frequently about the &s;treets; and I think I never was witne&s;s to &s;o many broils in all my life put together, as I was in my wanderings there&mdash;Not a time I went out that I did not ob&s;erve one, two, three, and &s;ometimes half a dozen or more. They have nothing terrible in them however, and, were it not extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;ee men &s;cold, would be very entertaining; for I will venture to &s;ay that a &s;treet battle "&agrave; la Turque" is one of the mo&s;t ludicrous exhibitions in the world. The par|ties approach to each other, and retreat mutually, as the action of the one gives hopes to the other of victory, lifting their hands, and flouri&s;hing them in the air, as if ready to &s;trike every moment, grinning and gna&s;hing their teeth, while their beard and whi&s;kers be&s;prent with the &s;pume of their mouths, and wagging with the quick motion of their lips and gha&s;tly contortions of their jaws, pre&s;ent the
<PB N="199" REF="033487_0198_0FF7240603B7FEF0">
mo&s;t ridiculous &s;pectacle imaginable. They remind|ed me at the time of a ver&s;e in an old Engli&s;h bal|lad:&mdash;
<Q><L>'Tis merry in the hall,</L>
<L>When beards wag all.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nothing, in fact, can exceed the extravagance of their ge&s;ture: the vehement loudne&s;s of their voice, or the whim&s;ical di&s;tortions of their countenances, in which are di&s;played &s;ometimes the quicke&s;t vici&s;|&s;itudes of fear and fury, and &s;ometimes the mo&s;t laughable combination of both. All this time, however, not a &s;ingle blow is actually &s;truck; but they compen&s;ate for the want of bodily prowe&s;s by the exerci&s;e of the tongue, denouncing vengeance again&s;t each other, threatening in&s;tant demolition, lavi&s;hing every bitter reproach, every filthy epithet, and every horrible imprecation that they can think of, and both boa&s;ting occa&s;ionally of their patience and forbearance, which fortunately enabled them to refrain from annihilating their adver&s;ary. At la&s;t the fray gradually decays: exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and half choaked with du&s;t and vociferation, they retreat gradually backwards to their own doors; where &s;umming up all their malignity into a mo&s;t horrid execration, they part for the time, and retire to vaunt in empty threat, and growl away their rage, in the rece&s;&s;es of their haram.</P>
<P>Yet tho&s;e people are found terrible in battle by the Chri&s;tian troops that have from time to time been oppo&s;ed to them: here, if proof be wanting of the effects of religion on the human mind, is an incontrovertable one of its powerful operations. Under the influence of their faith, which tells them that they go to Paradi&s;e in&s;tantly if killed in battle with Infidels, they perform prodigies of va|lour fighting again&s;t Chri&s;tians; while, forbidden by that faith to imbrue their hands in the blood of a true believer, their pa&s;&s;ions have been gradually brought under the dominion of their religion, till
<PB N="200" REF="033487_0199_0FF7240A0F0ED3F0">
that which at fir&s;t was faith at la&s;t becomes habit, and the appropriate energy and courage of the man has &s;unk into the degrading and ema&s;culant efforts of the woman.</P>
<P>The practice of fighting, or per&s;onal conflicts between individuals of the &s;ame &s;ociety, &s;eems to have been condemned by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all religions. The Gentoos, as well as all the other &s;ects of the various parts of the Ea&s;t through which I have travelled, give vent to their pa&s;&s;ion in near|ly the &s;ame manner as the Turks. The Chri&s;tians too are mo&s;t &s;trictly forbidden to &s;trike one another by the great Author of their faith: but it is their good fortune, that they not only have the be&s;t reli|gion in the world for their guidance, but that they are the only people in the world who claim exemp|tion from the penalties of that religion, and think them&s;elves wronged and their per&s;onal rights in|fringed, if they are refu&s;ed the privilege of break|ing through its rules whenever tho&s;e rules are at variance with their convenience.</P>
<P>Be it your care, my dear child, to fortify your mind with the &s;pirit of true religion and &s;ound morality, and let your practice in life be ever guid|ed by their precepts.</P>

<P>THE avidity with which human crea|tures &s;earch for &s;omething to recreate the mind and keep it in exerci&s;e, is of it&s;elf a convincing proof of the natural activity of our intellectual faculties, and &s;hews that, like the different parts of the bo|dy, they were given by Providence to be called into effort and improved by practice. As they who

Cards, dice, and games of chance are (according to the extent to which they are carried) of the two former&mdash;tale and novel-reading of the two latter. Tho&s;e how|ever &s;erve to occupy the vacant hours of all the idle and unemployed. And when letters deny their friendly aid, we find among our&s;elves the de|ficiency &s;upplied from the le&s;s ample re&s;ources of the memory; and &s;tory-telling, love tales, fairy tales, and goblin and gho&s;t adventures, are recited round the villager's fire or the kitchen hearth in as great numbers, with as much ingenuity, and to as great effect, as they are to be found written in the innumerable volumes on the &s;helves of our cir|culating libraries.</P>
<P>In Turkey, where the art of printing has not yet been known, were the circulation of literary pro|ductions is chained down within the narrow compa&s;s of manu&s;cript, and where therefore the efforts of genius are repre&s;&s;ed by di&s;couragement, the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tory-telling makes in it&s;elf a profe&s;&s;ion, which, as it is acquired by &s;tudy and pro&s;ecuted with art, is followed with con&s;iderably profit.</P>

eating-hou&s;es and coffee-hou&s;es, and every appen|dage that could render them convenient and com|fortable. As we were about leaving the la&s;t I ob&s;erved my friend &s;top and li&s;ten attentively. "Come hither," &s;aid he, after a minute's pau&s;e&mdash; "come into this coffee-hou&s;e, here is &s;omething going forward that may amu&s;e you."</P>
<P>We accordingly entered the coffee-hou&s;e, where we &s;aw a number of people, &s;ome &s;eated in the Tur|ki&s;h fa&s;hion, &s;ome on low &s;tools, and &s;ome &s;tand|ing; and in the middle a man walking to and fro, &s;peaking in an audible voice, &s;ometimes &s;lowly, &s;ometimes with rapidity, varying his tones occa&s;ion|ally with all the inflections of a corre&s;ponding &s;en&s;e. I could not under&s;tand him, but he &s;eemed to me to &s;peak with "good empha&s;is and good di&s;cre|tion:" his action was ea&s;y to him, though expre&s;|&s;ive and emphatical; and his countenance exhibited &s;trong marks of eloquent expre&s;&s;ion. I could not help &s;taring with a&s;toni&s;hment at a &s;cene &s;o new to me, and felt great approbation of the tones and manner of this extraordinary orator, though I could not under&s;tand a &s;ingle word he &s;aid. He was li&s;t|ened to by all with great attention, and the Turks (albeit not u&s;ed to the laughing mood) frequently betrayed &s;trong &s;ymptoms of ri&s;ibility: but in the height and torrent of his &s;peech he broke &s;uddenly off, &s;campered out of the door and di&s;appeard. I &s;et it down that he was a maniac or lunatic of an inge|nious kind, and was for going away. "Stay," &s;ays my friend, "re&s;t where you are for a few minutes, let us hear further."</P>
<P>The orator had &s;carcely been gone three minutes when the room was filled with the buzz of conver|&s;ation, a word of which I could not under&s;tand, but which my guide li&s;tened to very attentively. At length the buzz began to grow loud, and &s;oon increa&s;ed into clamour; when a &s;cene en&s;ued of &s;o very ludricious a kind as forced me to cram my
<PB N="203" REF="033487_0202_0FF724145332EAC0">
handkerchief into my mouth to &s;uppre&s;s a laugh, or at lea&s;t &s;o to &s;tifle it as to avoid ob&s;ervation. In &s;hort, they were di&s;puting violently, and the beards were, as I once before mentioned to you, ALL WAGGING. I became more convul&s;ed with mirth; and my friend &s;eeing that I was likely to give of|fence, took me under the arm and hurried me out of the coffee-hou&s;e: we retired into a porch in the caravan&s;era, where I gave vent to my &s;uppre&s;&s;ed laughter till my &s;ides were &s;ore and my eyes ran tears.</P>
<P>"In the name of God, my friend!" &s;aid I, "tell me what is the meaning of all that extravagant &s;cene to which we have ju&s;t now been witne&s;s: who is that madman that &s;poke &s;o much? and why did they all quarrel after he went away?"</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid he, "let us retire to my hou&s;e, and I will there explain the whole of it to you, from begining to ending."</P>
<P>I accordingly accompanied him home, where we found a very gay circle a&s;&s;embled, to whom he de|&s;cribed my a&s;toni&s;hment; recounting my immode|rate laughter, till they all laughed very nearly as im|moderately as my&s;elf. "You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, "that he whom you took to be a madman, is one of the mo&s;t cele|brated compo&s;ers and tellers of &s;tories in A&s;ia, and only wants the aid of printing to be perhaps as emi|nent in reputation for making CONTES, as Mar|montel or Madame D'Anois. As we pa&s;&s;ed along I heard his voice, and, knowing it, re&s;olved to let you &s;ee him, and brought you in for the purpo&s;e. He was entertaining the company with a very curi|ous, intere&s;ting, and comical &s;tory; the &s;ubject of which was ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce: the hero a mi&s;er of the name of Ca&s;&s;em. His mi&s;ery and avarice are repre&s;ented in it as bringing him into a variety of &s;crapes, which wa&s;te his wealth; and his character is drawn with &s;uch &s;trength of colouring, and marked with &s;uch

grote&s;que lines of humour&mdash;he related it moreover with &s;o much wit, in &s;uch admirable language, and embelli&s;hed and enforced it with &s;uch appropriate action, utterance, and empha&s;is&mdash;that it rivited, as you &s;aw, the attention of all his auditors, and ex|torted laughter even from Turki&s;h gravity,"</P>
<P>"But how came he to break off &s;o &s;uddenly?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"That," returned my friend, "is a part of the art of his profe&s;&s;ion, without which he could not live; ju&s;t as he gets to a mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the &s;tory, when he has wound the imagination of his auditors up to the highe&s;t climax of expectation, he purpo&s;ely breaks off to make them eager for the re&s;t. He is &s;ure to have them all next day, with additional numbers who come on their report, and he makes his terms to fini&s;h the &s;tory."</P>
<P>"Why then," interrupted I, "why did they&punc; who remained behind fall di&s;puting?"</P>
<P>"That I will explain to you," &s;aid he. Ju&s;t as he broke off, Ca&s;&s;em the mi&s;er (who, as far as I heard, &s;eems as well drawn as Moliere's AVARE) having already &s;uffered a thou&s;and whim&s;ical mi&s;|fortunes and dilapidations of fortune, is brought be|fore the cadi for digging in his garden, on the pre|&s;umption that he was digging for trea&s;ure. As &s;oon as the hi&s;torian was gone, they fir&s;t applauded him, and then began to di&s;cu&s;s his &s;tory&mdash;which they one and all agreed in prai&s;ing highly and when they came to talk of the probable i&s;&s;ue of the &s;equel of it, there were almo&s;t as many opinions as there were men in company; each maintained his own, and they went to loggerheads as you law about it&mdash; when the chance is a thou&s;and to one, that not one of them was near the mark. One in particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur|miled that Ca&s;&s;em would be married to the cadi's daughter; which gave great offence to &s;ome, and rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed another of the company to declare, that he was well a&s;&s;ured in his con&s;cience that Ca&s;&s;em

would be brought to the ba&s;tinado or the &s;take, or el&s;e hanged, in the &s;equel."</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid I, "that a group of twenty or thirty rational beings can be &s;o far bereft of all common &s;en&s;e, as to di&s;pute upon the re&s;ult of a contigency, which ab&s;olutely depends on the arbitrary fancy of an acknowledged fabricator of fal&s;ehoods?"</P>
<P>"<HI>C'e&s;t vrai,</HI> Mon&s;ieur? and thereby they de|mon&s;trate the power of the poet (for poet we may call him); and <HI>entre nous,</HI> I doubt whether it is not more rational, as well as more fair, to di&s;pute what the <HI>denouement</HI> ought to be before than after the in|ventor of the piece has di&s;po&s;ed of it, as is the practice with us. When he has once fini&s;hed his fable, you will find them all content, and the voice of critici&s;m &s;ilent. Now in France or England, our critics lie <HI>perdue,</HI> in order to attack the poet, let him fini&s;h his performance how he may. But you will recollect, Mon&s;ieur, that in Turkey criti|ci&s;m is the hone&s;t &s;pontaneous i&s;&s;ue of the heart, and with us is a trade, where &s;ometimes lucre, &s;ome|times vanity, but oftener than both, envy and ma|lice direct the deci&s;ion, and di&s;po&s;e to cavil and cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>"But we will go again to-morrow," continued he, "probably he will be there to conclude or pro|ceed further with his &s;tory;" I agreed to this and we parted.</P>
<P>On the next day we went, and not &s;eeing the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his place, lounged about the caravan&s;era, and going to another coffee-hou&s;e found him de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h all his might.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>MY la&s;t letter has &s;hewn you, that the conceptions of genius, though they may want the aid of the pre&s;s to bring them in full and perfect di&s;clo&s;ure to the world, will yet bur&s;t through their bounds, and find &s;ome means of communication with mankind; for though the art of printing be unknown in Turkey, the emanations of &s;uperior intellect and fancy find their way to the general ear through the medium of public declamation in cof|fee-hou&s;es. This letter will &s;erve to &s;hew you that malver&s;ation in office, public delinquency, and all tho&s;e crimes of the great, which with us are cog|nizable by no tribunal but that of the public pre&s;s, are not altogether &s;o exempt from the la&s;t and ex|po&s;ure of the &s;atiri&s;t in Turkey, as the want of that great palladium of freedom would di&s;po&s;e us to believe; and that, incredible as it may appear, the magi&s;trates are held up to ridicule in public exhibition, &s;atiri&s;ed with all the extravagant vul|garity of coar&s;e humour and unpoli&s;hed wit, and expo&s;ed with all the bitter exaggerations of enven|omed genius.</P>
<P>The French gentleman whom I mentined to you in my la&s;t, as having procured me that plea&s;ant repa&s;t at the coffee-hou&s;e, called on me a morning or two after that, and reminded me how highly I &s;eemed to be entertained: &s;aid, there were often to be &s;een, by walking about and going into public
<PB N="207" REF="033487_0206_0FF7241CC20A04B8">
places, a variety of things, which however worth|le&s;s and unentertaining in them&s;elves, might, from the novelty of their appearance, and their unlike|line&s;s to any thing &s;een in Europe, &s;erve either to divert by their oddity, or promote the conception of new ideas in the mind: he therefore recom|mended it to me, with all the zeal of a per&s;on who took an intere&s;t in my happine&s;s, to keep on my legs and in the &s;treets while I remained at Aleppo.</P>
<P>You will conclude that I readily complied, and we &s;allied ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> directly in que&s;t of adventure. We proceeded, therefore, to one of the before menti|oned coffee-hou&s;es, where, as my friend ob&s;erved to me, though there were no people of great rank, there was generally &s;omething to afford contempla|tion or amu&s;ement; and where, if nothing el&s;e occurred, the motley appearance of the company was &s;ufficient to excite a variety of whim&s;ical emo|tions, and &s;ugge&s;t numberle&s;s ludicrous images to the imagination of an Engli&s;h or French man. As there was no orator at work declaiming, I had time to indulge my&s;elf with a more accurate view than I had before taken of the group that &s;urround|ed us: and &s;urely never was ponderous gravity more ludicrou&s;ly, or in more various forms depicted by any caricaturi&s;t in the world.&mdash;Here it was to be &s;een, in all its &s;hadings, from the &s;elf-important nod of &s;erious cogitation, down to the &s;oporific a&s;pect of &s;tolid &s;tupidity. Not a mu&s;cle was mo|ved in way of mirth, not a face di&s;graced with a &s;mile, and I could not help thinking all the time, that if every nation of the earth was to take &s;ome animal for its in&s;ignia, as the Briti&s;h a&s;&s;ume the lion, and the Pru&s;&s;ian the eagle, the Turks might be divided in their choice between the appropriate claims of the owl and the a&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after we entered, a band of what they called mu&s;ic, &s;truck up a concert. And here again the notion of the owl and the a&s;s &s;truck me with
<PB N="208" REF="033487_0207_0FF72422045C8BF0">
increa&s;ed force, as peculiarly pre&s;iding over their mu&s;ic: for no other combination of &s;ounds that I know on earth, but the &s;creeching of the one, and the braying of the other, could form any thing to re&s;emble this concert, with which the auditory &s;eemed va&s;tly plea&s;ed, though I was obliged to be|take my&s;elf to &s;light, in order to get relief from the torture it give me. The Turks, however, as I retreated, honoured me with a few remarks, which as I did not under&s;tand, I could not pre|ci&s;ely feel&punc; my friend however told me, they were to the effect that we were Frangi Dumus (Frank H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g)&punc; and had no more ear than that filthy ani|mal for mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid my friend, don't be di&s;couraged!&mdash; But the mu&s;ic&mdash;the mu&s;ic! interrupted I.&mdash;Well then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the mu&s;ic, or rather the &s;ounds were execrable to be &s;ure; they have at lea&s;t &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h this certainty, that there is nothing, how|ever di&s;cordant or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;table, which habit will not reconcile us to.

<P>We vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted many coffee-hou&s;es in the cour&s;e of that day, in every one of which we found &s;ome|thing to divert or di&s;gu&s;t us; at length as we en|tered one, my friendly guide turning to me with &s;atisfaction in his countenance, &s;aid "Here is &s;omething about to go forward that will plea&s;e you better than the concert of mu&s;ic." What is it &s;aid I? A drama, returned he; a drama, to you mo&s;t certainly of a new and extraordinary kind; and I do a&s;&s;ure you that &s;o zealous am I to procure you entertainment, I would rather than a couple of lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s' you could under&s;tand what is going for|ward: your hearty mirth and laughter, added he, are &s;ufficient to put one in &s;pirits. He then di|rected my attention to a fellow who was bu&s;ily em|ployed
<PB N="209" REF="033487_0208_0FF72423AA412768">
in erecting a &s;tage, which he accompli&s;hed in a time incredibly &s;hort. The light of the &s;un was completely excluded, and a puppet &s;hew com|menced, which gave great delight to all the audi|ence, and ignorant as I was of the language, plea|&s;ed me very much.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed when informed that one man only &s;poke for all the per&s;onages of the drama, for &s;o artfully did he change his tone of voice, that I could have &s;worn there had been as many people to &s;peak, as there were characters in the piece. The images were not actually puppets, commonly &s;o called, but &s;hadows done in the manner of A&s;t|ley's <HI>Ombres Chinoi&s;es.</HI> They were, however, far inferior to his in execution and management, though the dialogue and incident evidently appear|ed even to me, to be executed with a degree of the <HI>vis comica</HI> far &s;uperior to any I ever &s;aw in a thing of the kind in Europe; indeed &s;o perfect was the whole, that though I knew not a word of the lan|guage, I comprehended clearly the plan of the piece, and many of the &s;trokes of humour con|tained in the dialogues.&mdash;The plan was obviou&s;ly taken from a &s;tory which I have read in &s;ome of the Ea&s;tern tales, I believe the Arabian Nights Enter|tainments, and it is founded on the law of the country, that a man may repudiate his wife twice, and take her back again; but in the event of a third divorce, cannot retake her to his marriage-bed, unle&s;s &s;he be previou&s;ly married and divorced by another man. To obviate which, hu&s;bands who repent having divorced their wives a third time, employ a man to marry them, and re&s;tore her back again; and he who does this office is called a <HI>Hullah.</HI>&mdash;In the piece before us, however, the Lady and the Hullah like each other &s;o well, that they agree not to &s;eparate; the hu&s;band brings them both before the cadi to enforce a &s;eparation; and the &s;cene before the cadi was as ludic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous, and
<PB N="210" REF="033487_0209_0FF7242550423758">
as keen a &s;atire upon tho&s;e magi&s;trates as can well be conceived, though of the low kind.</P>
<P>The piece was introduced with a grand nuptial proce&s;&s;ion, in which the ma&s;ter di&s;played the pow|ers of his voice by uttering a variety of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite tones in the whole gamut of the human voice; &s;ometimes &s;peaking, &s;ometimes &s;queaking like a hurt child, &s;ometimes hazz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing as a man, a woman, or a child; &s;ometimes neighing like a hor&s;e, and &s;ometimes inter&s;per&s;ing it with other &s;uch &s;ounds as commonly occur in crowds, in &s;uch a manner as a&s;toni&s;hed me: while the concomitant action of the images, grote&s;que beyond mea&s;ure, kept up the laugh; hor&s;es kicking and throwing their riders, a&s;&s;es biting tho&s;e near them, and kick|ing tho&s;e behind them, who retire limping in the mo&s;t ridiculous manner; while their great &s;tanding character in all pieces, KARA-GHUSE (the &s;ame as our Punch), rai&s;ed a general roar of ob&s;treperous mirth even from the Turks, with his whim&s;ical action, of which I mu&s;t &s;ay that, though non&s;e&s;i|cal, though indecent, and &s;ometimes even di&s;gu&s;t|ing, it was on the whole the mo&s;t fini&s;hed com|po&s;ition of low ribaldry and fun that I ever be|held.</P>
<P>When they come before the cadi, he is &s;eated in his divan of ju&s;tice; but as &s;oon as the complaint is opened and an&s;wered, he ri&s;es and comes for|ward between the contending parties: here he turns to one and demands in a terrific tone what he has to &s;ay, while the other puts ca&s;h in his hand behind, and in proportion as the ca&s;h is counted in, increa&s;es the terror of his voice; he then pockets the money, and again turns to the other, and de|mands what he has to offer, while in like manner he receives the bribes from his adver&s;ary and puts it in an oppo&s;ite pocket: this alternate application la&s;ts till the pur&s;es of both are exhau&s;ted, when, giving a great groan, he retires on one &s;ide to reck|on
<PB N="211" REF="033487_0210_0FF72427DB5CD260">
the money of each from a pocket he has on either &s;ide, one called plaintiff, and the other de|fendant; when balancing them, he finds plaintiff better by one a&s;per (or three-halfpence) than de|fendant, and pronounces his judgment accordingly. The defendant appeals to the ba&s;haw; they go be|fore him: KARA-GHUSE (Punch) however, takes the defendant a&s;ide, and in a dialogue, which my friend a&s;&s;ured me was pointed, witty, and bitterly &s;atirical, developes to him the whole &s;y&s;tem of ma|gi&s;tratical inju&s;tice, advi&s;es him to bribe the ba&s;haw, and declaring his zeal for all young people fond of amorous enjoyment (which he is at &s;ome pains to enlarge upon to the exce&s;s of indelicacy), offers him the aid of his pur&s;e. The advice is followed; the bribe is accepted; the cadi's decree is rever&s;ed, and him&s;elf di&s;graced, and the mob at once hu&s;tle him and bear the Hullah home to his bride with clamours of joy. Here again the ma&s;ter &s;hewed his extraordinary powers, giving not only, as before, di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite tones of voice, but huddling a number of different &s;ounds with &s;uch &s;kill and ra|pidity together, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ion that they were the i&s;&s;ue of a large and tumultuous crowd of men and animals. With this extravagant <HI>melange</HI> the curtain dropped, and the performance ended.</P>
<P>Returning home we conver&s;ed together on the &s;ubje&s;t of the piece, which I confe&s;s I could not get out of my head for &s;ome time. My friend explain|ed to me, as well as he could recollect, a great part of the dialogue, and a&s;&s;ured me, that the freedom of &s;peech of Mon&s;ieur KARA-GHUSE had from time to time created a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, not only to private offending individuals, but to the magi&s;tracy it&s;elf&mdash;that no offender, however intrenched behind power, or en&s;hrined in rank, could e&s;cape him&mdash;that ba&s;haws, cadis, nay the Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;aries them&s;elves, were often made the &s;port of his fury; that he was not

more re&s;trained in the effu&s;ions of ob&s;cenity which he utered, than in his &s;atire; that he was always well received and applauded, even venerated (as we venerate the liberty of the pre&s;s) as a bold teller of truth, who with little mi&s;chief does a great deal of good, and often rou&s;es the lethargic public mind to a &s;en&s;e of public dangers and injuries. He added, that in &s;ome ca&s;es the magi&s;trate had been obliged to interfere; and the ba&s;haw him&s;elf was &s;eriou&s;ly called upon at times to &s;top the licentious tongue of this champion of Freedom, KARA-GHUSE.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid I, "it appears upon the whole that Mon&s;ieur KARA-GHUSE is a very great black-guard, but a very witty, and a very hone&s;t one."</P>
<P>"You have ju&s;t hit it," &s;aid he; "and if Ma&s;ter Kara-ghu&s;e was to take &s;uch liberties in France, Spain, Portugal, or Germany, all his wit and hone&s;ty would not &s;ave him from puni&s;hment. In England you do not want him; every man there is a KARA-GHUSE, and every new&s;paper a puppet-&s;hew."</P>
<P>"And yet," returned I, "we complain &s;adly of want of liberty!"</P>
<P>"That is natural," returned my &s;agacious French|man, "perfectly natural. Liberty is like money; the more we have of it, the more covetous we grow."</P>
<P>"Very true, Mon&s;ieur," &s;aid I, plea&s;ed with his compliment to our happy con&s;titution, and to clinch his ob&s;ervation, gave a Latin quotation, which when a child I got out of Lilly's Grammar, "Cre&s;cit amor nummi, quantum ip&s;a pecunia cre&s;cit;" and then changging nummus for libertas, "Cre&s;cit amor li|bertatis, quantum ip&s;a libertas cre&s;cit."</P>
<P>"'Tis very well, Mon&s;ieur," &s;aid he; and to carry on your allu&s;ion, may we not &s;ay, that they who do not know when they have enough, are as dangerou&s;ly wrong in the one ca&s;e, as tho&s;e who &s;ay we have too much, are in the other? The En|gli&s;h complaining of the want of liberty, reminds me of the coffee-hou&s;e orator's &s;tory of Ca&s;&s;em, who,

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was, in the manner I have already mentioned, endeavouring to pa&s;s away the time as cheerfully as po&s;&s;ible, till a caravan was for|med, or Company's di&s;patches were coming over land, of which I might avail my&s;elf; I found my &s;ituation in the hou&s;e of Mr. &mdash; growing ex|tremely critical. That gentleman, of who&s;e good &s;en&s;e, and truly excellent di&s;po&s;ition, I had too manifold proofs to call them in que&s;tion, had, though fallen into the vale of years, married his la|dy at a very tender age. She was then young, beautiful, full of &s;en&s;ibility, and gifted with &s;uch natural endowments both of mind and per&s;on, ac|companied with all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which helped to dre&s;s them to advantage, that &s;he might well be acquitted of vanity, even though fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to her &s;he was fit to grace and confer hap|pine&s;s on a younger bed; while reflection on the obvious di&s;parity of the match (which the cool tem|per of &s;atiety po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;ted to him) might per|haps have alarmed his mind to circum&s;tances of probable danger, that, before wedlock, were all hid behind the deceptive veil of pa&s;&s;ion. Whe|ther the&s;e were the private &s;entiments that influen|ced both or either of them, I cannot pre&s;ume to determine, though I think it probable: for I was not long in the hou&s;e till I plainly perceived they were on a very bad footing with each other, and

in &s;hort that di&s;agreement was become habitual to them. At fir&s;t, that is to &s;ay, for a few days after my becoming an inmate of their hou&s;e, decency en|forced concealment, and the ebullitions of peevi&s;h|ne&s;s were &s;tifled by the dictates of prudence; but the animo&s;ities of the connubial &s;tate are tho&s;e which of all others are the mo&s;t impatient under control; and as time, by producing familiarity, relaxed re&s;t|raint, the pent-up pa&s;&s;ions began to force their way, and open bickering took place in my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is but barely doing ju&s;tice to my&s;elf to &s;ay, that I felt the mo&s;t poignant concern at &s;eeing a couple, each &s;o perfectly amiable in all other re&s;pects bla&s;t|ing the hours that &s;hould be given to harmony and love, in jarring reproach, and recrimination; and I would have given all I was worth that I had ne|ver had occa&s;ion to e&s;teem them &s;o much, or that I could give them that peace which &s;eemed to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lown them for ever. Fain would I ca&s;t a veil over the whole tran&s;action fain would I bury it even from my&s;elf, in oblivion: but it has been made by my enemies the &s;ubject of triumphant &s;lan|der; and to do ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, and di&s;claim the extent of guilt which they would impute to me, I am reluctantly obliged to avow the &s;hare I had, and declare how the matter really &s;tood. I mu&s;t &s;peak the truth, and hope you will not conceive that I de&s;ignedly lean too heavily upon any one, to ea&s;e my&s;elf of my &s;hare of the load.</P>
<P>Whatever dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s may &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween a married pair, the man, if prudent, will endeavour to conceal it; and the woman, if truly virtuous, will take care to do &s;o: &s;hould great di&s;|parity of age (as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) be the ca&s;e, the lady is more particularly bound to conceal any unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t it &s;hould be attributed to that cau&s;e which people are in &s;uch ca&s;es too prone to &s;u&s;pect, di&s;like to her hu&s;band; and before young men, above all, &s;he &s;hould be mo&s;t exemplary, as

&s;he mu&s;t well know that their natural vanity, com|bined with the leading idea of her aver&s;ion and infidelity to her hu&s;band, &s;ugge&s;t ideas to them from whence their warm imaginations draw infer|ences of a nature too plea&s;ing to be parted with, and too probable not to be put in practice, or at lea&s;t attempted. Here then a woman at once lays her&s;elf fairly open to the a&s;&s;aults of illicit love. I think it will not be denied, that the woman who promulgates the di&s;agreements between her and her hu&s;band, particularly if &s;he &s;uffers a young man to be privy to it, is either extremely ignorant, or in|tentionally vicious, or both.</P>
<P>That the lady I allude to may in &s;ome re&s;pect be acquitted of this imputation, I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;he was only eighteen years of age; her tender, in|experienced mind had not yet arrived to that matu|rity which gives &s;ound judgment; and though of good natural talents, highly cultivated (for &s;he &s;poke fluently Engli&s;h, French, Italian, Arabic, Per&s;ian, and the Greek and Turki&s;h languages), &s;he yet was &s;imple&punc; innocent, uninformed in the ways of the world, and incapable of rea&s;oning from cau&s;es up to con&s;equences. But unfortunately that &s;implicity is attended with as much mi&s;chief, though not guilt, as the wilful mi&s;conduct of the more expe|rienced; it has the &s;ame baleful effects with the hearers, in&s;pires the &s;ame confidence, emboldens with the &s;ame hopes, and leads to the &s;ame perni|cious practices.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, and will now remind you, that I was then young. Perhaps it was owing to a congeniality pointed out by our age, perhaps to a compa&s;&s;ionate politene&s;s amounting to tender|ne&s;s, which I always di&s;clo&s;ed on tho&s;e unhappy occa&s;ions, joined perhaps to the ardent look of youth kindled by the imaginations to which this imprudent conduct in&s;en&s;ibly gave birth, that the lady thought proper to take the very hazardous &s;tep

of making a confidant of a young man and a &s;oldier &mdash;and revealing to me the whole tale of her griev|ances, with a pathetic eloquence, that would have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon a much le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible heart than mine. I declare it mo&s;t &s;olemely, that though this extraordinary mark of confidence and e&s;teem communicated to my heart &s;trong &s;en&s;ations of unju&s;tifiable plea&s;ure: I &s;o far got the better of my&s;elf at fir&s;t, as to receive the whole with the &s;ame appearance of tranquility, as if I had been only a confidential female friend. I pitied, it is true;&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my pity:&mdash;I advi&s;ed, not trea|cherou&s;ly but faithfully;&mdash;I &s;aid &s;uch things as occured to me to be mo&s;t likely to a&s;&s;uage and ex|tingui&s;h the flame of di&s;cord, and lead to an amica|ble adju&s;tment; and I parted for that time with her to go to a &s;elf-approving pillow, where, while my fancy was inflamed and tickled by the flattering mark of regard &s;hewn me by &s;o all-accompli&s;hed a per&s;on. I had the &s;oothing delightful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having, as far as I was able, done my duty, and e&s;caped the corroding reflection of having violated the rights of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Not an opportunity however afterwards offered, that the &s;ame unhappy point was not the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and unfortunately tho&s;e opportunities but too frequenlly occurred; till at length we began to feel that they were the &s;weete&s;t minutes of our lives, and were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought for with indu&s;trious avidity by both of us.

We fell&mdash;but not intirely. There is one length to which no earthly con&s;ideration&mdash;no al|lurement however dazzling could tempt me&mdash;it is now the mo&s;t cordial con&s;olation to my mind; I never &s;uffered my&s;elf to think of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the decorum of his hou&s;e, nor did we in any &s;ingle in|&s;tance carry our intercour&s;e to a direct violation of his bed. Though the tran&s;ports of youthful pa&s;|&s;ion hurried us into conver&s;ations and reflections on the &s;ubject of her determination to be &s;eparated from her hu&s;band, yet that pa&s;&s;ion was of too deli|cate a kind to &s;ink into the brutal &s;ordid indulgence of di&s;honourable &s;tolen embraces. She wi&s;hed for that &s;eparation, rather as a &s;ubterfuge from ince&s;&s;ant diurnal mi&s;ery, than as a prelude to any vicious or illicit enjoyment; and we looked with plea&s;ure to the event, but we looked no further.</P>
<P>It is thus that, in the down-hill path of vice, we are hurried on &s;tep by &s;tep, fondly imagining that each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive object, which bounds our &s;ight, will &s;top our headlong career; while alas! every &s;tep we advance gives additional rapidity to our de|&s;cent: like the centripetal force of a projectile, our pace increa&s;es with uniformly accelerated motion&mdash; till di&s;daining all control, and breaking down every impediment that rea&s;on, morality, or honour throw in the way to re&s;cue us or retard our ruin, we pre|cipitate

unexpectedly into the la&s;t gulph of vice and infamy.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, an incident intervened in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, which arre&s;ted our progre&s;s down this hideous de&s;cent, and re&s;erved us both I hope to conviction of our folly, and repentance of our error. And I have the con&s;olation to reflect, that out of &s;uch a ho&s;t of dangers and temptations as I was be&s;et with, I have e&s;caped without the actual perpetration of a deed, which would, had it hap|pened, in all probability have embittered my life.</P>
<P>While we hugged our&s;elves in the &s;ecurity and &s;ecrecy of expre&s;&s;ing our genuine &s;entiments, her hu&s;band di&s;covered our wi&s;hes, and all at once took the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for preventing them. So that, overwhelmed with grief and &s;hame, I directly formed the re&s;olution to leave Aleppo, and proceed in the be&s;t manner I could on my de&s;ti|nation.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my dear FREDERICK, was your father, by failing to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of an unlawful and di&s;honourable pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;en&s;ibly led to the very brink of a precipice, the bare remem|brance of which now makes him &s;hudder with hor|ror. The &s;tory, by means unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention, took wind. The folly of &s;ome, the ma|lice of others, and the unaccountable propen&s;ity to fal&s;ehood of more, trumpeted it about with many exaggerations to my injury, and I was held up as the deliberate &s;educer of innocence: but the whole tran&s;action is exactly as I have &s;tated it; and the di&s;agreements previous to my arrival at Aleppo, which, in telling the &s;tory, they purpo&s;ely left out, were of &s;uch public notoriety, that every European, even the con&s;ul him&s;elf, was fully acquainted with them. This is the con&s;equence of a deviation from the &s;trict rule of right. Trea&s;ure it up in your mind, my child, never to be forgotten; and let it operate as a caution to you, how you entangle

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;covery to which I alluded in my la&s;t letter, &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved me very much<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and indeed it a&s;toni&s;hed me the more, from the manner in which it was communicated.</P>
<P>One day I received a polite me&s;&s;age from the Briti&s;h con&s;ul, &s;aying, he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of great con&s;e|quence. I thought at fir&s;t, that it might be &s;ome plan for my proceeding on my journey&mdash;perhaps Company's di&s;patches that had arrived to go over land; and at intervals, &s;omething like apprehen&s;i|ons of the true motive of his &s;ending for me flew acro&s;s my mind. I however went to him, when, after &s;ome little introductory conver&s;ation, he told me, that my ho&s;t Mr. &mdash; had been with him that morning, laying before him a complaint of a mo&s;t extraordinary and &s;erious nature, of which, as it immediately concerned me, he thought him|&s;elf bound to inform me, in order that I might either contradict &s;o gro&s;s a calumny if it were un|true, or find means to avoid the obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;a|ry re&s;ult if founded in fact.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to relate to me, that Mr. &mdash; had informed him of a con&s;piracy having been meditated again&s;t his peace and honour, be|tween his wife and the Engli&s;h gentleman whom he had entertained in his hou&s;e; that their plan was nothing le&s;s than an elopement, and that he did not know how &s;oon it might be carried into execution, if not timely prevented; and finally, that he had demanded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the con&s;ul and his intere&s;t with the Turki&s;h magi&s;trate to pre|vent
<PB N="221" REF="033487_0220_0FF72444803E83E8">
it, by granting him an armed force for the protection of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that conver&s;ations &s;o very guarded as ours were di&s;covered, and more &s;o that the aggrieved per&s;on did not think proper to &s;peak to my&s;elf, and charge me in per&s;on with the offence; never reflecting the while, that all my ideas were military, and his merely commercial: I was al&s;o much at a lo&s;s to conjecture how he came to make the di&s;covery&mdash;but this I found afterwards he owed to a female &s;ervant, who had been im|providently intru&s;ted by her mi&s;tre&s;s with the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Finding, however, that by whatever means he became acquainted with the affair, it was a certain fact that he was appri&s;ed of it, I directly acknow|ledged the whole truth with the utmo&s;t candour to the con&s;ul; told him the affair &s;tep by &s;tep as it aro&s;e, a&s;&s;uring him (which I really thought to be the ca&s;e) that pity for the lady's deplorable &s;itua|tion made me li&s;ten to &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and that unlawful pa&s;&s;ion had &s;o little to do with it, that in all our private conferences we had never tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the limits of purity; and that her per&s;on was, at lea&s;t re&s;pecting me, and I firmly believed all mankind, &s;potle&s;s and inviolate. I added, that great allowances were to be made for a young crea|ture barely eighteen years of age, con&s;igned by the wickedne&s;s of avaricious parents to the embraces of a man of &s;ixty-five; who, amiable and worthy though he was, in &s;ocial intercour&s;e with the world (which I knew him to be), was yet in the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able point of connubial felicity &s;o utterly defective, as nece&s;&s;arily to create di&s;gu&s;t and abhorrence in a youthful mind. I remarked to him, that, in the forming of laws, it as plainly appeared on their face, who made them among&s;t the Engli&s;h, as it does on the face of the Gentoo laws, that they were made by the Bramins: for,

as by the latter the penalty of a few puns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Couries, a kind of &s;mall &s;hells u&s;ed in India, as a circu|lating medium in place of coin, in value much below the &s;malle&s;t copper coin&mdash;a Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s a certain number of them.</NOTE> of cou|ries (not value a &s;hilling) is annexed to the perpe|tration of a crime, for which tho&s;e of another cla&s;s loo&s;e their lives; &s;o, among us, it appears that our laws are made by the aged, the decrepid, the &s;en&s;ual, and the rich. El&s;e it could never hap|pen that there were in the &s;ame code, laws to pun|i&s;h marriage between the young and vigorous, and enable the brutality of a parent to take its full &s;cope, and con&s;ign, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, youth, beauty, health, and every per&s;onal attraction, to the arms of age, infirmity, and impotence. And I concluded by &s;aying, that all parties aiding in &s;uch an unnatural confederacy &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The con&s;ul fairly acknowledged there was too much truth in what I had &s;aid; but remarked withal, that it was rather a hazardous experiment, and he was &s;ure it would be an endle&s;s one, to correct all the abu&s;es to which the fallibility of man, and his incompetency to form any thing per|fect, nece&s;&s;arily left &s;ociety and their laws liable&mdash; that the law was written, and it was the duty of every individual to obey it&mdash;and that in ca&s;es of adultery, the offence could be ju&s;tified on no &s;olid grounds whatever, for, independent of the feel|ings of the hu&s;band, which perhaps were more poignant in old age than youth, the injury to his family was not to be got over, in probably giving to him an heir no way a-kin to him. "It would be right, I think," &s;aid he, "to &s;top &s;uch di&s;pro|portionate matches; yet, once made, they &s;hould be as religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved inviolate as tho&s;e of love, among which we almo&s;t as frequently, as in tho&s;e of compul&s;ion, &s;ee in&s;tances of infidelity.

<P><PB N="223" REF="033487_0222_0FF7244A1F6049A0">I agreed to the ju&s;tice of what he &s;aid, at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured him, that my intentions went no farther than wi&s;hing the lady to be re&s;cued from her thraldom, which I told him was dreadful.&mdash; "I am &s;ure," &s;aid the con&s;ul, "that Mr. Camp|bell thinks &s;o, becau&s;e I am convinced he would not otherwi&s;e &s;ay &s;o.

<P>The con&s;ul &s;miled, and, turning the di&s;cour&s;e from its direct line, ob&s;erved, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould de&s;i&s;t, el&s;e he would be obliged to u&s;e his influence and power to protect Mr. &mdash;.</P>

<P>Being now con&s;trained by every con&s;ideration, as well of prudence and decency as of inclination, to leave Aleppo immediately; I determined that no common impediments &s;hould &s;top me, and waited with impatience the arrival of the per&s;on on whom the con&s;ul re&s;ted his hopes of di&s;patching me.</P>
<P>He came in the evening, and after a conference with the con&s;ul he introduced him to me, and ac|quainted me that he was a Tartar, and one of the va&s;t number of that de&s;cription who are employed by the Turki&s;h &s;tate in carrying di&s;patches from court to the various viceroys and ba&s;haws, and in|terchangeably between them again; that they were men on who&s;e fidelity the utmo&s;t reliance could be had; and that this man, who had an excellent cha|racter, had agreed to take me to Bagdad, provided I would &s;ubmit to the di&s;gui&s;e of a Tartar.</P>
<P>The agreement between us I entirely &s;ubmitted to the di&s;cretion of the con&s;ul, who had the good|ne&s;s to &s;ettle it thus:&mdash;The Tartar was to deliver me &s;afe at Bagdad; to &s;upply me and my &s;ervant, who acted as interpreter, with an ample &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ions and hor&s;es on the road; to exchange my hor&s;e for me as often as I plea&s;ed, and to go at &s;uch a rate, whether fa&s;ter or &s;lower, as I thought proper: for this he was to receive one hundred pounds; and I further promi&s;ed, as an encourage|ment to him, that if he acted to my &s;atisfaction, I would, on our arrival at Bagdad, add a douceur of twenty pounds.</P>
<P>The next day he came, and I had a di&s;tinct view of this my new fellow traveller and &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;t|er, for in &s;everal places, I was to pa&s;s for his &s;lave. He was one of tho&s;e &s;triking <HI>character</HI> figures that a painter would like to take a &s;ketch of&mdash;and me-thought Tartar was written legibly in every line|ament of his countenance and per&s;on.&mdash;He was

He &s;urveyed me with great atten|tion &mdash;opened his mouth two or three times like a ga&s;ping pike, as if to &s;peak&mdash;&s;troaked his whi&s;kers as often&mdash;and at la&s;t pronounced that he would un|dertake to conduct me; adding, in allu&s;ion to my black hair and dark complexion, that I looked more like a native, than any Frank he had ever &s;een. He ordered me to cut my hair quite &s;hort, to pro|vide my&s;elf with the Tartar dre&s;s and cap, in the fa&s;hion of his own; and &s;aying he would call on me in proper time, departed.</P>
<P>Thus equipped, we &s;et out, not without great pain and regret on my part; pain at leaving a mo&s;t beau|tiful young woman, whom I pitied and e&s;teemed, &s;ubject to the re&s;entment of a hu&s;band, at once jea|lous from nature, peevi&s;h from habit, and enraged from her open and unequivocal demon&s;trations of hatred and regret at having been betrayed by &s;itua|ation into &s;uch a very &s;erious dilemma.</P>
<P>After my departure from Aleppo, this affair was repre&s;ented in a variety of unfavourable lights to

<P>AS I became familiari&s;ed to my Tartar guide I found his character di&s;clo&s;e much better traits than his fir&s;t appearance be&s;poke, and I began in&s;en&s;ibility to think him a very entertaining fel|low: preceiving that I was very low &s;pirited
<PB N="228" REF="033487_0227_0FF7245923794C80">
and thoughtful, he exhibited manife&s;t marks of compa&s;&s;ion; and taking it into his head that I was actually removed for ever from my friends and my family, he &s;poke in a &s;tyle of regret and feeling, that did great honor to his heart: and to &s;ay the truth, he did every thing in his power to alleviate my feelings, conver&s;ing with me either by means of the inter|preter, or in broken lingua franca; &s;upplying all my wants cheerfully and abundantly; changing hor&s;es with me as often as I pea&s;ed, and going &s;low or golloping forward ju&s;t as be&s;t &s;uited my inclination or humour.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object he &s;eemed to have in view on our journey, was to impre&s;s me with a notion of his con&s;equence and authority, as a me&s;&s;enger belong|ing to the Sultan. As all tho&s;e men are employed by the fir&s;t magi&s;trates in the country, and are, as it were, the links of communication between them, they think them&s;elves of great importance in the &s;tate; while the great men who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s they are employed in, make them feel the weight of author|ity, and treat them with the greate&s;t contempt: hence they become habitually &s;ervile to their &s;uperi|ors, and by natural con&s;equence in&s;olent and over-bearing to their inferiors, or tho&s;e who being in their power they conceive to be &s;o. As carriers of di&s;paches, their power and authority wherever they go is in &s;ome points undi&s;puted; and they can com|pel a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, hor&s;es, and attendants, wherever it &s;uits their occa&s;ions; nor dare any man re&s;i&s;t their right to take the hor&s;e from under him to proceed on the Emperor's bu&s;ine&s;s, be the owner's occa&s;ion ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>My feelings, which I can tell you were altoge|ther of the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant kind, &s;erved as a &s;timu|lus to my mind, and increa&s;ed my anxiety to get forward; I therefore pu&s;hed on as fa&s;t as the hor&s;es, which were in general excellent, could carry me: and as we halted at a number of &s;tages to get fre&s;h
<PB N="229" REF="033487_0228_0FF7245AB45E2C78">
hor&s;es and provi&s;ions, my Tartar guide had frequent opportunities of indulging his &s;elf-importance, and di&s;playing his great authority and power. As &s;oon as he &s;topped at a caravan&s;era, he immediately cal|led lu&s;tily about him in the name of the Sultan, demanding with an imperious and menacing tone of voice, fre&s;h hor&s;es, victuals, &amp;c. on the in&s;tant. The terror of this great man operated like magic; nothing could exceed the activity of the men, the bri&s;kne&s;s of the women, and the terror of the chil|dren; for the caravan&s;eras are continually attended by numbers of the very lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the people; but no quickne&s;s of preparation, no effort or in|du&s;try could &s;atisfy my gentleman; he would &s;hew me his power in a &s;till more &s;triking point of view, and fall belabouring them with his whip, and kick|ing them with all his might. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was much hurt at this extravagant abu&s;e of up&s;tart pow|er, and was two or three times on the point of in|terfering; but fortunately, recollected that it would neither be in character, nor have any good effect, and that if I pre&s;umed to &s;peak, my guide would be obliged in my defence to give me a flogging in order to prevent &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>This incon&s;iderate tyranny and cruelty, I had afterwards rea&s;on to believe, was by no means a part of his natural di&s;po&s;ition; but vanity, to which &s;o many among us in Europe fall victims, urged him to exce&s;&s;es, which I dare &s;ay his heart private|ly condemned.</P>
<P>It was on the fifth or &s;ixth day (I cannot pre|ci&s;ely &s;ay which) after our leaving Aleppo, that we got to the city of Diarbeker, the capital of the province of that name, having pa&s;&s;ed over an ex|tent of country of between three and four hundred miles, mo&s;t of it ble&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t fertility, producing, in the few cultivated parts, grain, fruits of various kinds, and &s;ilk in great variety and abundance, and abounding with as rich pa&s;tures as
<PB N="230" REF="033487_0229_0FF7245C4D02DF20">
I ever beheld, covered with numerous herds and flocks. The air was charmingly temperate in the day-time, but, to my feeling, extremely cold at night.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the extreme fertility of this country, the bad admini&s;tration of government, con|&s;piring with the indolence of the inhabitants, leaves it unpopulous and uncultivated. Diarbeker, pro|per, called al&s;o Me&s;opotamia, from its lying be|tween the two famous rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and by Mo&s;es called PADAN ARAM, that is to &s;ay &mdash;"The fruitful Syria;" abounds with corn, wine, oil, fruits, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;eat of the Earthly Paradi&s;e, and all geographers agree that it was there the de&s;cendants of Noah fir&s;t &s;ettled after the flood.</P>
<P>In&s;ignificant as tho&s;e circum&s;tances may appear to mere calculators of profit and lo&s;s, it cannot be de|nied that they have a powerful and plea&s;ing effect on the refined imagination. To be treading that ground where Abraham trod; where Nahor the fa|ther of Rebecca lived; and where Laban, to whom Jacob fled to avoid his brother E&s;au's re&s;entment, and whom he &s;erved fourteen years for the love he bore to Rachel, was to me a circum&s;tance produc|tive of delightful &s;en&s;ations. How finely has that giant of the pen, John&s;on, ju&s;tified tho&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions in his Tour to the Highlands of Scotland and We&s;tern I&s;lands;&mdash;de&s;cribing his emotions on vi&s;it|ing the famous i&s;land of Iona, or Colombkill, he &s;ays&mdash;"We were now treading that illu&s;trious i&s;land which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence &s;avage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge, and ble&s;&s;ings of religion. To ab&s;tract the mind from all local emo|tion, would be impo&s;&s;ible if it were endeavoured, and would be fooli&s;h if it were po&s;&s;ible. What|ever withdraws us from the power of our &s;en&s;es&mdash; whatever makes the pa&s;t, the di&s;tant, or the future,

predominate over the pre&s;ent, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me, and from my friends, be &s;uch frigid philo&s;ophy, as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wi&s;dom, bra|very, or virtue!&mdash;that man is little to be envied who&s;e patrioti&s;m would not gain force upon the Plain of Marathon, or who&s;e piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona."</P>
<P>The city of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arbeker it&s;elf is &s;ituated in a de|lightful plain on the banks of the river Tigris, and nearly at its head; it is one of the riche&s;t, mo&s;t trading, &s;trong, and populous cities in A&s;iatic Tur|key; and is adorned with many pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zzas and mar|ket places in the Turki&s;h &s;tyle, and a large magni|ficent mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">que, formerly a Chri&s;tian church; for Chri&s;tianity flouri&s;hed over this country &s;o late as the &s;ixth century.

<P>Few countries in the world exceed that about this city for natural richne&s;s and beauty:&mdash;the bread and wine are excellent&mdash;the fruit beyond conception delicious&mdash;and my friend the Tartar took care, under pretence of &s;upercilious <HI>hauteur,</HI> to tear in pieces a couple of fowls, and hand me now a leg, now a wing, till I made the mo&s;t deli|cious repa&s;t I ever remember to have eat in my life.</P>
<P>It is computed that there are re&s;ident in this city no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian inhabitants, &s;ome of whom are of the Church of Rome;&mdash;and perhaps it is owing to that mixture, that the fair &s;ex have more freedom, and the men more polite|ne&s;s and affability, than tho&s;e of any other city in

<P>AS we advanced towards the &s;outhward and ea&s;tward, in our way from Diarbeker towards Bagdad, I found the air become &s;en&s;ibly warmer, and ob&s;erved that the di&s;po&s;ition of the people grew more and more brutal. My guide's conduct for he knew them well) became proportiontely

artful, and my manners were of cour&s;e to grow &s;o much the humbler. I ob&s;erved, however, that his authority continued the &s;ame, and that he &s;eemed to exert it with greater rigour; not in &s;everity or cha&s;ti&s;ement, but in exacting implicit obedience. Yet &s;till he evidently acted with great caution and circum&s;pection; for, in &s;ome di&s;tricts, he either avoided the little villages by a circuitous route, or da&s;hed through them at a very quick pace, while the gaping multitude con&s;idered us as on a di&s;patch of ha&s;te and importance&mdash;in others, he entered the towns without re&s;erve, and left it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance to de|cide whether we &s;hould be di&s;covered or not. At &s;ome caravan&s;eras he treated me with affected neg|ligence, at others he made me eat with him and drink wine, of which, in &s;ome places, he him&s;elf drank copiou&s;ly, and at others as &s;crupulou&s;ly re|frained from. And &s;ometimes we lay at night out in the open air, rather than enter a town; on which occa&s;ions I found the weather as piercing cold as it was di&s;tre&s;sfully hot in the day time. Bred, as the man was, a mixture of &s;lave and, ty|rant, I can &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome parts of this conduct to ari&s;e from caprice; but, as he was naturally kind, as many of tho&s;e aberrations from the u&s;ual mode of travelling were atttended with hard&s;hip and in|convenience to him&s;elf, and as my &s;ervant and the other Tartar were clearly of opinion he was right, I am rather di&s;po&s;ed to believe that he, on the whole, acted from principles of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and policy.</P>
<P>He frequently advi&s;ed me again&s;t indulging in laughter; &s;aid it was unmanly, indecorous, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the gravity becoming a wi&s;e man, and withal dangerous.</P>
<P>One evening we came to a caravan&s;era much fa|tigued, the day being extremely hot, and we hav|ing rode very hard&mdash;whether it was caprice or fatigue, or the &s;ugge&s;tion of policy that moved him,

I cannot &s;ay, but he was certainly more di&s;po&s;ed to play the tyrant than I had ever before &s;een him. He flogged the men who took the hor&s;es, kicked every one he met, made the hou&s;e ring with his enormous voice; directed &s;upper to be got ready, ate growling, and finding fault with every thing; and under pretence of di&s;liking the ingredients of an excellent pillaw, handed it over to me, &s;aying, "Here, Jimmel (the name he called me), here, take this filth, and cram it down thy coar&s;e throat, it is only fit for a Frank"&mdash;I took it with be&s;t air of humility I could a&s;&s;ume; and tearing the meat with my fingers, which I al&s;o u&s;ed in&s;tead of a &s;poon to eat the rice, &s;wallowed it eagerly; he watching me all the time attentively. When I had fini&s;hed it, I gave him a hint in the Frank lan|guage, that I &s;hould like to wa&s;h it down with &s;ome wine; but he did not, or rather would not under|&s;tand me.</P>
<P>Supper done, he ordered a &s;ervant to attend him with &s;ome water, and directed him to wa&s;h his feet; while that operation was performing, he continued menacing every one about him. My &s;ervant, who &s;at next me and behind him, interpreted every thing he &s;aid. "Yes, ye &s;laves," &s;aid he, as he lolled back upon his cu&s;hion, "yes, I will make the be&s;t of you wa&s;h my feet; for who &s;hall refu&s;e to wa&s;h the feet of him, who repre&s;ents the Sultan of the World, the Son of Mahomet, the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord?" The poor fellow proceeded in his humble office, and only interrupted him by &s;aying, "Ble&s;&s;ed be my Lord the &s;ultan, and glory be to the Lord our God, and Mahomet his prophet." "Yes, yes," continued my Tartar, "ble&s;s God and the prophet, and pray for his &s;ervant our &s;ultan, and all who repre&s;ent him like me, that &s;laves of your de&s;cription are permitted to live: nay, thou &s;halt wa&s;h this Frank's feet:" then turning to me with an air of magi&s;terial tenderne&s;s, "Jimmel,"

&s;aid he, "hold forth thy feet, and let them be wa&s;hed by this di&s;ciple of Ali&mdash;I &s;ay, hold forth thy feet."</P>
<P>Scarcely able to refrain from laughter at this Bombardinian of the Ea&s;t, and his pompous man|ner of i&s;&s;uing his orders, I drew up my trow&s;ers and took off my boots&mdash;the man brought fre&s;h wa|ter, and fell to rubbing my feet with great good will and humility; yet evidently felt &s;o much hurt at the humiliation, that I was &s;orry for it, and would rather have di&s;pen&s;ed with the wa&s;hing, though it was a luxury.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this operation, the Tartar, who was reclining on his cu&s;hion, &s;moking, ro&s;e up, and &s;talking two or three times acro&s;s the room, with the mo&s;t ludicrous air of &s;elf conceit and im|portance, took his tobacco pipe from his mouth, brandi&s;hed it in o&s;tentatious parade, and in the tone and manner rather of one that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving than of a man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, bur&s;t out with an emphati|cal expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction, and &s;aid, "This it is to be protected by a great man: Mu&s;&s;ulmen &s;alam to him and wa&s;h his feet."</P>
<P>The extravagance of this &s;entiment, the ab&s;ur|dity of its application, and the con&s;equential &s;o|lemnity of his action and countenance while he &s;poke, altogether ru&s;hed upon me with &s;uch impe|tuous force, that I could not re&s;i&s;t it, and, in &s;pite of every effort to re&s;train my&s;elf, bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laughter.</P>

rather grinned than frowned; though under it were to be &s;een &s;hame and mortification, &s;orrow and re|&s;entment, pride and degradation, &s;illy ba&s;hfulne&s;s and decayed importance. For &s;ome time he &s;tood transfixed to the &s;pot, his eyes gli&s;tening like tho&s;e of a rat in a trap; his pointed whi&s;kers moving with the contortions of his lips, and his mouth every now and then opening like the beak of a wounded hawk. To utter his &s;en&s;ations he was unable; and he continued in this &s;tate, not only till my laughter was abated, but till I had time to reflect and be &s;eriou&s;ly concerned.</P>
<P>At length, without &s;aying a &s;entence, he wheel|ed about, threw off his &s;lippers, drew on his boots, vociferated till he brought all the people of the caravan&s;era about him, and ordered hor&s;es to be ready in&s;tantly. As orders from &s;uch a per&s;on were not likely to be di&s;obeyed, the hor&s;es were got ready. I &s;aw that I mu&s;t either proceed, or come to an open rupture with him; &s;o recollect|ing that I was my&s;elf in fault, that a di&s;pute might be fatal, and that at all events it was only the hu|mour of the moment, I drew on my boots too, and was ready to go, though I was much fitter for a twelve hours' nap than for an hour's travelling on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>We mounted immediately, and it was my good fortune to have the be&s;t hor&s;e. He &s;et out upon the gallop, the moon &s;hining as bright almo&s;t as day; I put forward my hor&s;e, and kept rather be|fore him, which vexed him &s;o, that he beat the poor animal he rode on mo&s;t unmercifully. At length after about eight or ten miles riding, he called a halt&mdash;di&s;mounted, and &s;aid he would re&s;t there all night. I &s;aw it was I re&s;entment: but knowing that it would be in vain to remon&s;trate, I di&s;|mounted too; and, judging that the be&s;t way to mortify him in return, was to comply with affected approbation, turned to my &s;ervant and told him
<PB N="238" REF="033487_0237_0FF7247440DEA030">
(knowing that it would go from him to the Tartar) that I was delighted with the beauty of the night; remarking at the &s;ame time, that lying in the &s;weet &s;alu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious air was far preferable to being confined in the &s;ultry fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th of a caravan&s;era.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was communicated to the Tartar, he remarked, that the open air was the fitte&s;t place for the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, and therefore &s;uitable to a Frank: but for his part, he had much rather repo&s;e on a cu&s;hion, which he &s;hould have done, had it not been for my accur&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ible faculties.</P>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation re&s;ted, and we fell a&s;leep. In a few hours he awoke us, and we &s;et forward: after &s;ome pau&s;e, he began in the following man|ner, when was interpreted to me, as he &s;poke, by my &s;ervant:</P>
<P>"Surely God made laughter for the deri&s;ion and &s;hame of mankind, and gave it to the Franks and the monkies; for the one ha, ha, ha's, and the other he, he, he's, and both are malicious, mi&s;|chievous, and good for nothing but to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et and tan|talize all that come acro&s;s them."</P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed, as waiting for &s;omething to be &s;aid: however, I remained &s;ilent. At length, he continued: "Not but that, with all their laughter, they have the wi&s;dom to take &s;pecial care of them|&s;elves; for half a dozen monkies, will he, he, he, and empty a whole orchard of its fruit in the reck|oning of a hundred; and a Frank will ha, ha, ha, and eat you up pillaws and poultry like a wolf, and drink up wine with the &s;ame moderation that a camel drinks up water."</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould have choaked with &s;mothered laughter: I would not however interrupt him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o contrived to keep it to my&s;elf: he proceded to apothegmati&s;e:</P>
<P>"But with all their he, he, he's, and ha, ha, ha's, it &s;ometimes turns out that they are caught: the monkey is &s;eized in a trap and caged or knock|ed
<PB N="239" REF="033487_0238_0FF7247AD597CD30">
in the head, and the Frank is put in jail, and ba&s;tinadoed or hanged; and then the tune is chan|ged, and it is Oh, ho, ho!" Here he began to mimic crying &s;o admirably, and at the &s;ame time &s;o ridiculou&s;ly; that I bur&s;t out laughing again.</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve, Jimmel," &s;aid he ha&s;tily, "ob&s;erve! you can't refrain! But by our holy prophet," &s;aid he &s;eriou&s;ly, "it may end as I &s;aid: &s;o look to your|&s;elf, and avoid laughter in caravan&s;eras, or we part; for there are places, and that was one of them la&s;t night, where &s;u&s;picion would ruin you. And if you lo&s;t your life, what &s;hould I &s;ay for my&s;elf on my return to Aleppo? Eh, what &s;hould I &s;ay for my&s;elf? Ha ha, ha! would not do. No, no, they would not believe it, and I &s;hould lo&s;e my character."</P>
<P>"Why don't you laugh your&s;elf?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Very &s;eldom, or rather never," returned he; "at lea&s;t I would not in time of danger. No, no, none but Chri&s;tians and monkies makes a practice of laughing&mdash;Turks and Tartars are wi&s;er." I pro|mi&s;ed him, that I would in future take more care; and, by way of appea&s;ing him with a little &s;lavery, &s;aid, that he played his part &s;o admirably, it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e. But he an&s;wered, with a grave face, that his action in that care was of too &s;erious nature to be made a &s;ubject of merriment &mdash;and advi&s;ed me to believe it &s;o.</P>

<P>THE &s;olicitude of my guide for my &s;afety was the earne&s;tne&s;s of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s zealous to di&s;charge with the utmo&s;t punctuality the duty he had undertaken; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that
<PB N="240" REF="033487_0239_0FF7247C6371CAA0">
the whole of his conduct evinced a preci&s;ion and punctually of dealing rarely found in our intercour&s;e with mankind. Previous to leaving Aloppo, he had undertaken to convey me &s;afe&mdash;he was, as you may already perceive, indefatigable and unremitting in his endeavours to do &s;o; he had promi&s;ed to &s;up|ply me with food&mdash;&s;o he did, in the mo&s;t ample manner; he promi&s;ed to go as I plea&s;ed fa&s;t or &s;low &mdash;&s;o he did; he promi&s;ed to change hor&s;es with me, as often as I thought proper to de&s;ire&mdash;he did &s;o. But beyond this, he &s;eemed to carry his care of me no farther than to any bale of goods he might have in his charge. He was bound to deliver me &s;afe, in good order and condition, at Bagdad: &s;o much he was determined to do, and no more did he think of. I had got letters to the ba&s;haws of &s;ome of the towns through which we were to pa&s;s: but as the delivery of a letter is, according to the cu&s;tom of that country always accompanied with a pre&s;ent, I thought it better to decline delivering them, except when nece&s;&s;ity compelled&mdash;though the &s;tate of the country was &s;o un&s;ettled, that we often had occa&s;ion for a guard.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the remembrance of the laughing affair was a little decayed, the Tartar began to relax into good humour, and to talk with his u&s;ual vehemence; for he was always, according to the flow of his &s;pirits, either &s;ullenly &s;ilent or extravagantly l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">qua|cious. His tongue might be con&s;idered as a thermo|meter, by which the warmth or coldne&s;s of his temper might be calculated, and the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emes&punc; of garrulity and taciturnity were the indices. His conver&s;ation, however, was very circum&s;cribed, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of &s;tories of him&s;elf and his hor&s;e, the amazing journeys he made, and the fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of man|hood he performed. One circum&s;tance I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice mention, as I think it mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trongly the ha|bitual delicacy and mode&s;ty of this people. Al|though he frequently lamented my bani&s;hment from
<PB N="241" REF="033487_0240_0FF7247DF6BFCAF8">
my family, and although we were for eighteen days continually conver&s;ing on a variety of occa&s;ions that might lead to the &s;ubject, he never once talked of women; never, in all his pity for my &s;ituation, glanced even remotely at the po&s;&s;ibility of my get|ting a &s;ub&s;titute in that way; never hinted that he thought of them him&s;elf. On &s;eeing women, co|ming to the wells, they remined me of &s;ome of the &s;tories in the Old Te&s;tament. I mentioned it, but it went no farther; for whenever the &s;ubject was &s;tarted, he threw cold water on it.</P>
<P>That he conceived me to be in &s;ome re&s;pects a parcel of property, I have good rea&s;on to believe: for I ob&s;erved that at &s;ome caravan&s;eras the people collected round me, and regarded me with &s;trong &s;ymptoms of &s;urpri&s;e and pity; &s;ome viewed me with commi&s;eration, &s;ome with contempt; but not one creature, however wretched or abject, &s;eemed to envy my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I was the more confirmed in this opinion by an incident that happened between Diarbeker and Mo&s;ul. One morning I was unu&s;ually overcome with the fatigues of the preceding day: the Tar|tar called me, &s;ummoned me to hor&s;e; and finding that I gave no an&s;wer, nor &s;hewed any token of awaking, he lifted me in his arms bodily from my couch (&s;uch was his &s;trength that he did it without any difficulty), carried me out without the lea&s;t ceremony, and, before I was &s;o completely awake as to be &s;en&s;ible of my &s;ituation, had me fixed up|on a horie ready to depart.</P>
<P>A tran&s;action &s;o very &s;ingular, you may well con|clude, &s;urpri&s;ed me at the time, and would not readily be forgotten: &s;uch a crowd of &s;trange, con|fu&s;ed, and incongruous thoughts and &s;en&s;ations as occurred to me, I never before experienced: they were painful, they were &s;urpri&s;ing&mdash;but I was in &s;uch a &s;tate that I could not afterwards analy&s;e them. The chief reflection that aro&s;e from it was,
<PB N="242" REF="033487_0241_0FF724814F297070">
that human &s;entiment mu&s;t be in a deplorable &s;tate of degradation indeed, when &s;uch a circum&s;tance could occur from the notion that a man was as much an a&s;&s;et or piece of property, could be tran&s;|ferred by the &s;ame means, and moved in the &s;ame unfeeling manner, as any portion of inert matter that makes up a bale of merchandize. Of the truth of this po&s;ition I had &s;oon after a melancholy proof, in an incident which, though lamentable, was attended with &s;uch ludicrous circum&s;tances, that even now I never think of it without &s;miling &mdash;&s;miling, as I did then, with a heart bleeding with pity.</P>
<P>One morning I was awakened before day-break with a bu&s;tle in the caravan&s;era where we lodged. I conjectured that the Tartar was preparing to get forward, and ro&s;e in order to lo&s;e no time. I was &s;o far right in my conjectures: the hor&s;es were rea|dy, and I came out to mount, and was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to perceive &s;everal hor&s;es before me loaded with &s;omething which &s;tood erect from their backs, and which I had barely light to di&s;cern were not men. I concluded that they were bales of merchandize packed in a particular form, and a&s;ked no que&s;tions till full day-light di&s;clo&s;ed to me that they were human creatures tied up in &s;acks, and fa&s;tened a&s;tride on the hor&s;es' backs. There was a &s;trange union of horror and oddity in the conception, that &s;truck me at once with a mixed emotion of indignation, pity, and mirth.&mdash;The former however got the better, and I a&s;ked my &s;ervant with &s;ome warmth what it meant&mdash;He &s;aid that the &s;acks contained &s;ome young women whom the Tartar had bought.&mdash;<Q>Good GOD! &s;aid I, is it po&s;&s;ible that he can have bought wretched females to treat them with &s;o little tenderne&s;s?</Q>
<Q>He has bought them, returned my &s;ervant, in the way of traffic, not for plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="033487_0242_0FF7248410D34040">"Suppo&s;e he has," &s;aid I, "&s;uppo&s;e even they were men, not to mention young women, how can he imagine that they will &s;urvive this? Tied up and &s;weltered in a &s;ack&mdash;fa&s;tened cro&s;s-legs, on a hor&s;e, and driven at &s;uch an amazing rate (for by this time we had &s;et forward, and another Tartar was whipping the hor&s;es up all the time, and dri|ving them on)&mdash;how is it po&s;&s;ible they can &s;ur|vive? They mu&s;t be &s;mothered&mdash;they mu&s;t be &s;hattered to pieces&mdash;they mu&s;t be &s;tripped, exco|riated, and tortured to death!"</P>
<P>"If I might pre&s;ume to advi&s;e," &s;aid he, "I would &s;ay that you had better make no remarks upon it: it would only get them perhaps wor&s;e treated, and rai&s;e his anger again&s;t you."</P>
<P>To conclude, I took his advice, and kept my mind to my&s;elf. The unfortunate women were in this manner carried fifty miles, at the end of which their tender-hearted purcha&s;er di&s;po&s;ed of them in &s;ome way of keeping till his return; when I &s;up|po&s;e they were to be carried back in &s;acks a&s;tride upon hor&s;es, all the way to Aleppo, there to be &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>To us, my FREDERICK, who live in a country where an hour's detention in a hou&s;e again&s;t our will is puni&s;hed as unlawful impri&s;onment, and who feel and value the rich trea&s;ure of liberty above all earthly ble&s;&s;ings, the bare idea of &s;lavery appears horrible; when the mi&s;eries of &s;lavery are &s;harpened by cruelty, our indignation burns at the offence: but &s;uch a complicated piece of enormity as that I have mentioned, almo&s;t tran&s;cends belief, and indignation is lo&s;t in amazement. There are but few men, even in our bracing climate, whom fifty miles riding would not &s;hake to pieces, and torture almo&s;t to death. No woman would think of it. But when to that is &s;uperadded, fir&s;t the compul&s;ion&mdash;then the &s;orry and at be&s;t painful equipage of the hor&s;es&mdash;the tender per&s;ons, unac|cu&s;tomed to riding, of the women&mdash;the &s;mother|ing

heat of the &s;ack&mdash;and above all the horrid cli|mate, burning with an almo&s;t vertical heat (vertical at lea&s;t compared with our oblique &s;un)&mdash;it will be allowed to be a wonder, almo&s;t approaching to a miracle, that they &s;urvived one half of their jour|ney. The wonder-working hand of Omnipotence alone could bring them through it; and when I a&s;ked in the evening whether they were dying or dead, and was told that they were not only alive but in perfect health, I could not help repeating that mo&s;t beautiful expre&s;&s;ion put into the mouth of Maria by the inimitable Sterne, "God tempers the wind to the &s;ide of the &s;horn lamb."</P>
<P>This affair tended to prejudice me &s;trongly again&s;t my Tartar guide, and I was for &s;ome time that I could not look upon him without horror: but at length my re&s;entment abated; and rea&s;on, re&s;uming her &s;eat of cool deci&s;ion, told me, that though it was a crime and a grievous one, he was not &s;o re|&s;pon&s;ible for it as tho&s;e who, knowing better, au|thori&s;ed it by their concurrence, gave it the &s;anction of law, and made it familiarly practi&s;ed; he only did that which he had been even from his mother's brea&s;t in&s;tructed to do, and &s;hould therefore not be judged by tho&s;e rules which a Briton would lay down for the government of &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>

<P>FROM the con&s;iderations I have already pretty fully mentioned, my mind was by no means at ca&s;e. The ince&s;&s;ant travelling for &s;o many days, at the rate of &s;eventy-five miles a day, to be con|tinued
<PB N="246" REF="033487_0245_0FF7248C43FECFD8">
I knew not how long, increa&s;ed my anx|iety: and the apprehen&s;ions of accident, interrup|tion, and above all &s;ickne&s;s, intercepting me on my way, haunted my imagination with all its terrors. I was be&s;ides approaching fa&s;t to that region where the winds &s;trike all living things that draw them in in&s;tantly dead: and conceiving that the more ex|peditions I was in getting over the journey, the greater chance I had of e&s;caping tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs; I pu&s;hed heartily forward, and urged the Tartar till he at la&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment and approba|tion; paid me the compliment to &s;ay, that I was almo&s;t equal to him&s;elf for enduring fatigue; and concluded with a very &s;agacious &s;urmi&s;e, that in all probability I had been my&s;elf a carrier of di&s;patches among the Frank governments.</P>
<P>One day after we had rode about four miles from a caravan&s;era, at which we had changed our cattle, I found that a mo&s;t execrable bad hor&s;e had fallen to my lot: he was &s;tiff, feeble, and &s;oundered; in con&s;equence of which he &s;tumbled very much, and I every minute expected that he would fall and roll over me. I therefore propo&s;ed to the guide to ex|change with me; a favour he had hitherto never refu&s;ed, and for which I was the more anxious, as the bea&s;t he rode was of the very be&s;t kind. To my utter a&s;toni&s;hment he peremptorily refu&s;ed: and as this had been a day of unu&s;ual taciturnity on his part, I attributed his refu&s;al to peevi&s;hne&s;s and ill temper, and was re&s;olved not to let the matter re&s;t there. I therefore de&s;ired the interpreter to in|form him, that as he had at Aleppo agreed to change hor&s;es with me as often as I plea&s;ed, I &s;hould con&s;ider our agreement infringed upon if he did not comply, and would write to the Con&s;ul at Aleppo to that effect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was conveyed to him, he &s;eemed &s;trongly agitated by anger; yet endeavoured to con|ceal his emotions under affected contempt and deri|&s;ion,
<PB N="247" REF="033487_0246_0FF7249179076168">
which produced from him one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular grins that ever yet marred the human phy|&s;iognomy. At length he broke forth:</P>
<P>"You will write to Aleppo, will you? Fooli&s;h Frank! they will not believe you! By Mahomet, it would be well done to hear the complaint of a wandering Frank again&s;t Ha&s;&s;an Artaz&mdash;Ha&s;&s;an the faithful and the ju&s;t, who for ten years and more has been the me&s;&s;enger of an emperor, and the friend and confidant of cadis, ba&s;haws, and vice|roys, and never yet was called &s;o much as liar! Who, think you, poor mi&s;guided one! who, think you, would belive that I broke my promi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Why do you not then," &s;aid I, interrupting him, "why do you not perform it by changing hor&s;es, when you are convinced in your con&s;cience (if you have any) that it was part of your agree|ment?"&mdash;"Once for all I tell you," interrupted he, "I will not give up this hor&s;e. There is not," &s;aid he ga&s;conadingly, "there is not a Mu&s;&s;ulman that ever wore a beard, not to talk of a wretched Frank, that &s;hould get this hor&s;e from under me; I would not yield him to the commander of the faithful this minute, were he in your place: I would not, I tell you Frank&mdash;and I have my own rea&s;ons for it."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay you have," returned I; "love of your ea&s;e, and fear of your bones."</P>
<P>At hearing this, he grew quite outrageous&mdash;cal|led MAHOMET and ALLA to witne&s;s that he did not know what it was to fear any thing&mdash;declared that he was convinced that &s;ome infernal &s;pirit had that day got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me&mdash;and indeed &s;eemed well di&s;po&s;ed to go to logger-heads. At length ob&s;erving that I looked at him with &s;neering con|temptuous defiance, he rode up along &s;ide of me&mdash; I thought it was to &s;trike, and prepared to defend my&s;elf. I was however mi&s;taken; he &s;natched the reins out of my hand, and caught hold of them
<PB N="248" REF="033487_0247_0FF724930915CE40">
collected clo&s;e at the hor&s;e's jaw; then fell flogging my hor&s;e and &s;purring his own, till he got them both in full &s;peed; nor did he &s;top there, but con|tinued to belabour mine with his whip, and to &s;pur his own, driving headlong over every impediment that came in our way, till I really thought he had run mad, or de&s;igned to kill me. Several times I was on the point of &s;triking him with my whip, in order to knock him off his hor&s;e&mdash;but as often patience providentially came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and whi&s;pered to me to forbear and &s;ee it out. Mean time I con&s;idered my&s;elf as being in &s;ome danger; and yet &s;uch was the power he had over the cattle, that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top him: &s;o re&s;igning the event to the direction of Providence, I &s;uffered him without a further effort to proceed; I calling him every opprobrious name I could think of in lingua Franca, and he grinning, and calling me Dumus, Jiha&s;h, Burhl (i. e. hog, a&s;s, mule), in rapid and impetuous vehemence of tone and utter|ance.</P>
<P>He continued this for a length of I dare &s;ay &s;ome miles&punc; over an uncultivated tract, here and there in|ter&s;ected with channels formed by rills of water in the periodical rains; thickly &s;et with low furze, ferns, and other dwarf bu&s;hes, and broken up and down into little hills. His hor&s;e carried him clean over all: and though mine was every minute &s;tum|bling and nearly down, yet with a dexterity inex|pre&s;&s;ible, and a vigour altogether amazing, he kept him up by the bridle, and I may &s;ay <HI>carried</HI> him gallantly over every thing. I was a&s;toni&s;hed very much at all this, and towards the end as much plea|&s;ed as a&s;toni&s;hed; which he perceiving, cried out frequently and triumphantly, "O, la Frangi! Heli! Heli! Frangi!" and at la&s;t drawing in the hor&s;es, &s;topping &s;hort, and looking me full in the face, exclaimed in lingua Franca, "Que dice, Frangi&mdash;Que dice?"</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="033487_0248_0FF72495C5014BB8">For &s;ome time I was incapable of making him any an&s;wer, but continued &s;urveying him from head to foot as the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;avage I had ever beheld; while he &s;troked his whi&s;kers with great &s;elf-complacency and compo&s;ure, and nodded his head every now and then, as much as to &s;ay, Ay, ay, it is &s;o! look at me! am not I a very capital fellow?&mdash;"A capital fellow indeed you are," &s;aid I, "but I wi&s;h I was well out of your confound|ed clutches."</P>
<P>We alighted on the brow of a &s;mall hill, whence was to be &s;een a full and uninterrupted pro&s;pect of the country all round. The interpreter coming up, he called to him and de&s;ired him to explain to me carefully the meaning of what he was about to &s;ay; which I will give you as nearly as I can in his own words, as they were tran&s;lated by the lingui&s;t:</P>
<P>"You &s;ee tho&s;e mountains yonder," &s;aid he, pointing to the ea&s;t; "tho&s;e are in the province of <HI>Kurde&s;tan,</HI> inhabited by a vile race of robbers called Je&s;ides, who pay homage to a God of their own called Je&s;id (Je&s;us), and wor&s;hip the Devil from fear. They live by plunder, and often de|&s;cend from tho&s;e mountains, cro&s;s the Tigris which runs between them and us, and plunder and ravage this country in bands of great number and formida|ble &s;trength, carrying away into &s;lavery all they can catch, and killing all who re&s;i&s;t them. This country therefore, for &s;ome di&s;tance round us, is very dangerous to travellers, who&s;e only &s;afety lies in flight. Now it was our misfortune this morning to get a very bad hor&s;e, for which, plea&s;e ALLA (&s;troking his whi&s;kers), &s;ome one &s;hall receive the ba&s;tinado. Should we meet with a band of tho&s;e Curds, what could we do but fly? And if you, Frangi, rode this hor&s;e, and I that, we could never e&s;cape; for I doubt you could not keep him up from falling under me, as I did under you: I &s;hould
<PB N="250" REF="033487_0249_0FF724976885D338">
therefore come down and be taken&mdash;you would lo&s;e your guide, and mi&s;s your way, and all of us be undone. Be&s;ides," continued he, "there are many villages here where people live, who, if they only &s;u&s;pected you were a Frank, would fol|low and &s;acrifice you if they could to MAHOMET, and where of cour&s;e you mu&s;t run for it."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the interpreter had explained this to me, "Well," continued the Tartar, "what does he &s;ay now to it?" Then turning to me, and to&s;|&s;ing up his head&mdash;"Que dice, Frangi?"</P>
<P>"Why, I &s;ay," returned I, "that you have &s;po|ken good &s;en&s;e and found rea&s;on; and I am obli|ged to you."</P>
<P>This, when interpreted fully, operated mo&s;t plea|&s;ingly upon him; his features relaxed into a broad look of &s;atisfaction, and he &s;aid:&mdash;"I will do every thing I can to make you ea&s;y and contented: and when I am ob&s;tinate, don't re&s;i&s;t&mdash;for be a&s;&s;ured I have rea&s;on for it; and above all things avoid laugh|ing in my pre&s;ence. But we &s;hall reach Mo&s;ul by and bye, and probably then we may have no more rides." For I expected to get down the river Ti|gris from Mo&s;ul to Bagdad, and had told him &s;o, and he encouraged me with the expectation.</P>
<P>That night we came to a caravan&s;era which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from a village. Here the Tartar, plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for the conduct of the day, and plea&s;ed with me for my approbation of it, or|dered a mo&s;t admirable &s;upper; and not only, as was very common with him, rejected the be&s;t di&s;h in order to pre&s;ent it to me, but al&s;o &s;elected for me the choice&s;t bits of tho&s;e upon the table. He then ordered wine, ob&s;erving that the fatigue of a gov|ernment me&s;&s;enger demanded indulgence; and u&s;ing a &s;alvo of my &s;ugge&s;tion on a former occa&s;ion, viz. that the Prophet would not be offended with travellers more than with the &s;ick for taking it as it were <HI>medicinally.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="033487_0250_0FF7249B8AB3E610">We accordingly had wine, and admirable it was, though by no means equal to that we drank at the city of Diarbeker. I took little however, and the Tartar was much &s;urpri&s;ed at my ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s; remarking, that he never &s;aw a Frank before that was not a downright hog when he got the cup to his lips. My taking it in &s;mall portions, while he drank it as we do table beer, particularly a&s;toni&s;hed him. Before he lay down on his couch, he gave orders for hor&s;es, threatening the people with &s;evere ca&s;tigition if they gave bad ones; holding up as an example the per&s;on that gave us the &s;tumbling hor&s;e that day, who he declared &s;hould be ba&s;tinadoed as &s;oon as he returned, if there was a cadi within ten leagues of him; and I dare to &s;ay that he kept his word mo&s;t religiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The next morning we had excellent cattle; fear produced wonders among them, and we &s;et forward ju&s;t as the &s;un ro&s;e. As we entered the fir&s;t vil|lage, I was &s;omewhat alarmed by perceiving my guide draw up his hor&s;e&mdash;deliberate&mdash;mutter to him&s;elf&mdash;and &s;eem rather unea&s;y while he viewed a crowd that was up the &s;treet before us; &s;ome of whom I perceived to be agitated with &s;ome extra|ordinary motions of the body, while one man &s;tood in the middle, rolling his body into a variety of &s;trange contortions.&mdash;The Tartar, for a minute or two, &s;eemed to be debating within him&s;elf whether he &s;hould proceed or turn about: at length putting me on his left hand, he &s;et forward at full &s;peed, leaving the crowd on his right, who, &s;eeing the rapidity of our pace, flew on one &s;ide, and let us pa&s;s. We &s;oon however heard &s;houting behind us, and could hear plainly the words, "Ghiaour! Frangi Cucu!" and looking back, perceived &s;eve|ral ragged men like &s;avages pur&s;uing us, lifting &s;tones occa&s;ionally, and ca&s;ting them after us with all their might. The &s;peed of our hor&s;es at la&s;t got us out of both &s;ight and hearing; and I plainly perceived,
<PB N="252" REF="033487_0251_0FF7249FD5732A48">
and was for the fir&s;t time convinced, that my guide's conduct was directed by &s;ound &s;en&s;e, &s;pirit, good faith, and integrity.</P>

<P>THE extraordinary occurrence which I mentioned in my la&s;t letter required explanation, and my Tartar friend was not backward in giving it; for he loved exceedingly to hear him&s;elf talk, and, on any &s;ubject within the compa&s;s of his know|ledge, was &s;hrewd, per&s;picuous, and even naturally eloquent: he had moreover on that occa&s;ion acted the part of a &s;kilful general; and as I applauded his prudence and addre&s;s, he was extremely kind and communicative, and gave me a full account of that affair, his motives, his deliberations, and the ur|gency of the ca&s;e; and, in &s;kort, every thing that could elucidate the circum&s;tance, or aggrandize his own importance. It would be a pity to take it out of his own words: I &s;hall therefore relate them to you, as I had them through the medium of our lin|gui&s;t, for they made an impre&s;&s;ion on my memory not ea&s;ily te be era&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he, "that there are &s;pread over the face of this great and glorious em|pire a number of dervi&s;es of different kinds&mdash;<HI>holy</HI> men, who renounce the enjoyments and plea&s;ures of the world to conver&s;e with Mahomet and wor|&s;hip Alla. Some of tho&s;e are very good men, in|deed &s;aints, and never do any thing bad; preaching and praying, without hurting any thing, even a rat or a &s;nake; nay, they would not hurt a Chri&s;tian. There are others again, of whom I have heard our ba&s;haws and effendis, and even the Maazeen, declare
<PB N="253" REF="033487_0252_0FF724A162CADC40">
that they are forbid by the Koran; and yet the common people (the lower &s;ort you know have no &s;en&s;e) reverence and wor&s;hip them&mdash;they are called <HI>Santons;</HI> live by them&s;elves, &s;ometimes under ground like rabbits, end &s;ometimes in the thickets and woods. They go where they plea&s;e, take the be&s;t &s;eat in any man's hou&s;e, cram them&s;elves with meat and drink, and yet none re&s;i&s;t them; for &s;ome will not, and others dare not. Nay, they often pollute women in the open &s;treets&mdash;and they never &s;et their eyes on a Chri&s;tian or a Frank, that they will not kill, if po&s;&s;ible. For my part, I think that they ought to be hanged, every one of them that had a head to be hanged by&mdash;or rather &s;taked &mdash;for no puni&s;hment is too great for them; but I dare not &s;ay &s;o in that town&mdash;if I did, I &s;hould be &s;toned to death by the rabble.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I perceived the crowd, and the ra&s;|cals dancing, I knew that they were &s;antons, and was &s;ure that they would &s;top us in order to extract money from us; in which ca&s;e they would mo&s;t probably have di&s;covered you&mdash;for they have the eyes of the devil. Nothing then could &s;ave your life; the crowd would join them, and your brains would have been beat out with &s;tones. I had a mind to turn back and go round the town, but that might have cau&s;ed &s;u&s;picion, and got us perhaps intercepted; &s;o I determined to pu&s;h by them boldly, which I did, you can te&s;tify, like a brave man. You &s;aw enough your&s;elf, to convince you of the danger you have e&s;caped, and of my wi&s;dom and valour; let me therefore entreat you to be en|tirely guided by me, and above all things avoid that accur&s;ed propen&s;ity to laughter."</P>
<P>Since I fir&s;t formed the re&s;olution of writing this account of my journey, I have been at &s;ome pains to dip into the be&s;t hi&s;tories of that country, and I find that in every in&s;tance my Tartar guide's in|formation was correct. Tho&s;e &s;antons, as well as
<PB N="254" REF="033487_0253_0FF724A345041A78">
other cla&s;&s;es of dervi&s;es and &s;heihs, travel about the country, and levy contributions on the inhabi|tants: &s;ome are really what they pretend to be, and are as pure and as pious as the monks of the primitive Chri&s;tian church; but the &s;antons are mon&s;ters, who exi&s;t only by the barbarous creduli|ty and more than &s;avage ignorance of the lower order of the people&mdash;though reprobated, and in|deed, execrated, by the better &s;ort of Turks. They affect to be dementated (which with the Mahomedans is the greate&s;t mark of &s;anctity), and under cover of that madne&s;s commit every exce&s;s and enormity, not merely with impunity, but with applau&s;e. Such is the melancholy &s;tate of degrada|tion, to which the weight of &s;uper&s;tition's chains bends the mind of man! It is not long &s;ince I had a very plea&s;ing di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this extraordinary &s;ub|ject, with a gentleman of my acquain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance, for who&s;e veracity I have great re&s;pect. Super&s;tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on and credulity very naturally led to a con&s;ideration of the Turki&s;h religion, and I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;atis|faction, that the wor&s;t excre&s;cences of the Chri&s;tian &s;chi&s;ms could not be compared with the Turki&s;h faith in their dervi&s;es. He &s;aid, that he agreed it did not go quite the length of the &s;antons; but he related to me a conver&s;ation between him and a Roman catholic, not more than twenty-four miles from the enlightened city of Dublin, which &s;ur|pri&s;ed me much.</P>
<P>"I was," &s;aid he, "when a youth, very free in cen&s;uring all religions, and chiefly Popery; for, being bred among Roman catholics, I had the greater opportunity of &s;eeing their ab&s;urdities, which I trea&s;ured up as &s;o much gain, without ever taking into account their many virtues, of which they have their &s;hare. One day I was on a party of plea&s;ure, at a place called &mdash;, and in pre|&s;ence of a poor country fellow ridiculed the prie&s;t|hood, attributing to them many vices, and particu|larly
<PB N="255" REF="033487_0254_0FF724A827129040">
fornication and adultery. The man re&s;i&s;ted me, and declared it was impo&s;&s;ible, Then I &s;up|po&s;e, &s;aid I, if a prie&s;t and a woman were locked up in a room together for a year, and the woman in a week after coming forth was brought to bed of a child, you would not believe it to be the prie&s;t's. No, &s;aid he, I would not. Then how comes the child? I don't know, replied he&mdash;any way but by him. In &s;hort, he would believe in &s;elf-impregnation, or preternatural vi&s;itation, rather than allow a prie&s;t to be capable of fornication."</P>
<P>"But," &s;aid I, "you &s;uppo&s;ed a ca&s;e&mdash;if the fellow was &s;hrewd enough to &s;ay, no &s;uch ca&s;e could at all happen, he would have put you down; that was what he meant, though he knew not how to go about expre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The difficulties and hazards of the journey, which &s;eemed to thicken upon us as we advanced, made me pant for a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion to it; and the ad|venture of the la&s;t day opened more clearly to my view the dangers we had to encounter, which were &s;till likely to increa&s;e as we got to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward, where the fury of bigotry raged with|out remor&s;e; where the greater di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government made the populace more law|le&s;s, and the magi&s;trate more corrupt and tyranni|cal; where the total &s;eclu&s;ion from all well ordered &s;ociety rendered the manners barbarous; where &s;trangers were &s;eldom &s;een, and when &s;een fleeced and per&s;ecuted; and where particularly I had rea|&s;on to believe, &s;carcely any Engli&s;hman had ever &s;et his foot; and above all, where the very winds that blew were charged with de&s;truction, and car|ried in&s;tant death upon their wings. I therefore earne&s;tly longed to reach Mo&s;ul, where the proba|bility was, I &s;hould get at lea&s;t the more comforta|ble and commodious conveyance of water carriage, and where I might refre&s;h my&s;elf completely, after the fatigues of &s;o many days journey; and, if there

was occa&s;ion, claim a guard and protection, having along with me a letter to the ba&s;haw, which I might withhold or deliver, ju&s;t as be&s;t &s;uited my inclination or convenience.</P>
<P>I could not help viewing with a &s;ad and melan|choly eye my pre&s;ent &s;tate; wandering, I may &s;ay alone, unaccommodated and wretched, through an inho&s;pitable region, and more inho&s;pitable people; where danger be&s;et me in a thou&s;and forms, and every &s;tep I took, I took in hazard of my life; and comparing it with tho&s;e &s;cenes of opulence and comfort which I had once experienced, where every lawful wi&s;h met with its accompli&s;hment; where every nece&s;&s;ity was &s;upplied, and every difficulty obviated; where tender love and attachment antici|pated every de&s;ire; and &s;oothed every care: where the mutual endearments and reciprocal accommoda|tions of tender relatives, wife, children, faithful friends, and kindly intimates gave a ze&s;t to life, made me feel that my exi&s;tence was of intere&s;t to others as well as to my&s;elf, and communicated a con&s;cious importance which the i&s;olated, &s;olitary, &s;elfi&s;h man can never feel: I could not help look|ing back with grief and mortification, to think that I once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;hould perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s them no more; but, on the contrary, might peri&s;h unknown, unheeded, and unlamented, in an unknown corner of the wilds of an unknown ho&s;tile country, without one friend to &s;olace or to cheer me, or tell to tho&s;e who loved or took &s;hare in my concerns, the place where I lay, or the par|ticulars of my fate.</P>
<P>Nor in this di&s;mal train of reflections was Aleppo forgotten. It made the great connecting link be|tween my former happine&s;s and pre&s;ent mi&s;ery; it was, as it were, the door through which I pa&s;&s;ed when I took my la&s;t farewell of comfort: when it clo&s;ed and &s;hut me out, the pro&s;pect was indeed gloomy; nor did I after feel one happy &s;en&s;ation,
<PB N="257" REF="033487_0256_0FF724AB4B1D46A0">
unle&s;s the convul&s;ive tran&s;ports of a laugh, and the boi&s;terous fleeting mirth ari&s;ing from the &s;ingulari|ties of my guide, which, as the &s;urge rai&s;ed by the tempe&s;t above its proper height lifts up the &s;hat|tered bark only to ca&s;t it on the beach and leave it &s;hip-wrecked, elevated my &s;pirits for the moment beyond their proper pitch, to retire quickly, and leave them in the horrors of ten times deeper melancholy.</P>
<P>Perceiving how much ca&s;t down I was, my friendly Tartar began to rally me: "Jimmel," &s;aid he, "the &s;antons have frightened you:&mdash;but don't be afraid&mdash;HASSAN ARTAZ is no boy: he can bring you through greater difficulties than tho&s;e, &s;hould they befall us."</P>
<P>"But how comes it," &s;aid I, "Ha&s;&s;an, that you, who have &s;o much power at the caravan&s;eras, have not power to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e ra&s;cally &s;antons, or the mobs of a village?"</P>
<P>"Why, as to the mob," &s;aid he, "if I was by my&s;elf, or had only a true Believer with me, I would make them fly before me like the du&s;t be|fore the wind. As to the &s;antons, no one can re|&s;i&s;t them: the Great, who hate them, are obliged to &s;how them re&s;pect: and the ba&s;haw of Aleppo, nay the Commander of the Faithful him&s;elf, could not &s;ave you, if one of them called on the mob to &s;tone you, or tear you to pieces. However, be of good cheer; for, plea&s;e ALLA, I will deliver you &s;afe and &s;ound to the Coja at Bagdad: be&s;ides, we &s;hall very &s;oon be at Mo&s;ul from whence we will go down by water, which will be very plea&s;ant: and the chief danger then will be in fair fighting, which is better than being cut off by &s;antons.&mdash; Should there be occa&s;ion," &s;aid he, looking mo&s;t ferociou&s;ly and brandi&s;hing his whip&mdash;"&s;hould we be attacked by Curds or Robbers, you &s;hall &s;ee&mdash; you &s;hall &s;ee, Jimme!&mdash;Oh! holy Prophet, how I'll fight!"</P>

<P>IT was early in the evening when the pointed turrets of the city of Mo&s;ul opened on our view, and communicated no very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations to my heart. I found my&s;elf on Scrip|ture ground; and could not help feeling &s;ome por|tion of the pride of the traveller, when I reflected that I was now within &s;ight of Nineveh, renowned in Holy Writ.&mdash;The city is &s;eated in a very barren &s;andy plain, on the banks of the river Tigris, em|belli&s;hed with the united gifts of Pomona, Ceres, and Flora. The external view of the town is much in its favour, being encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;tately walls of &s;olid &s;tone, over which the &s;teeples or minarets of other lofty buildings are &s;een with in|crea&s;ed effect. Here I fir&s;t &s;aw a large caravan en|camped, halting on its march from the Gulph of Per&s;ia to Armenia; and it certainly made a mo&s;t noble appearance, filling the eye with a multitude of grand objects, all uniting to form one magnifi|cent whole.</P>
<P>But though the out&s;ide be &s;o beautiful, the in&s;ide is mo&s;t dete&s;table: the heat is &s;o inten&s;e, that in the middle of the day there is no &s;tirring out; and even at night the walls of the hou&s;es are &s;o heated by the day's &s;un, as to produce a di&s;agreeable heat to the body at a foot or even a yard di&s;tance from them. However, I entered it with &s;pirits, becau&s;e I con&s;idered it as the la&s;t &s;tage of the wor&s;t part of my pilgrimage. But al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s! I was di&s;appointed in my expectation; for the Tigris was dried up by the inten&s;ity of the heat, and an unu&s;ually long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ought; and I was obliged to take the matter with a patient

&s;hrug, and accommodate my mind to a journey on hor&s;eback, which, though not &s;o long as that I had already made, was likely to be equally dangerous, and which therefore demanded a full exertion of fortitude and re&s;olution.&mdash;There are a thou&s;and la|tent energies in every man, which only want the powerful voice of nece&s;&s;ity to call them out: and now drawn to the top of my bent, I prepared my mind to &s;et out in the morning, with as much cheer|fulne&s;s as if the hopes of water carriage to Bagdad had never once occured to my mind.</P>
<P>It was &s;till the hot &s;ea&s;on of the year, and we were to travel through that country, over which the horrid wind I have before mentioned &s;weeps its con&s;uming bla&s;ts: it is called by the Turks &s;a|miel, is mentioned by holy Job under the name of the Ea&s;t Wind, and extends its ravages all the way from the extreme end of the Gulph of Cambaya up to Mo&s;ul; it carries along with it fleaks of fire, like threads of &s;ilk; in&s;tantly &s;trikes dead tho&s;e that breathe it, and con&s;umes them inwardly to a&s;hes; the fle&s;h &s;oon becoming black as a coal, and dropping off from the bones. Philo&s;ophers con&s;i|der it as a kind of electric fire, proceeding from the &s;ulphureous or nitrous exhalations which are kindled by the agitation of the winds. The only po&s;&s;ible means of e&s;cape from its fatal effects, is to fall flat on the ground, and thereby prevent the drawing it in&punc; to do this, however, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to &s;ee it, which is not always practicable.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the ordinary heat of the climate is extremely dangerous to the blood and lungs, and even to the &s;kin, which it bli&s;ters and peels away from the fle&s;h, affecting the eyes &s;o much that tra|vellers are obliged to wear a tran&s;parent covering over them to keep the heat off.</P>
<P>That night, Ha&s;&s;an &s;aid, that as we mu&s;t proceed to Bagdad on hor&s;eback, he would &s;tay the next at Mo&s;ul to refre&s;h us; which I objected to: he then

&s;poke of the &s;ucceeding part of the journey as a thing of nothing: we had already come near nine hundred miles, and had not above five to go: be|&s;ides, as the weather was warmer, we would travel more in the night, and lie-by in the day-time, in places with which he was well acquainted.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the poor fellow &s;eemed to take an in|tere&s;t in my &s;afety, and to wi&s;h to alleviate the pains of my mind; and he always concluded with a remon&s;trance again&s;t laughing, which from fre|quently hearing I now under&s;tood even in his own language.&mdash;"Don't laugh&punc; Jimmel, don't laugh," he would &s;ay with great &s;olemnity.&mdash;By the bye, I ob&s;erved, that when he was well di&s;po&s;ed to me he always called me Jimmel (a name which I pre&s;ume he con&s;tructed, with my &s;ervant's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the re&s;emblance of &s;ound between Campbel and Camel, Jimmel being the Turki&s;h for that animal); and when angry, he called me Frangi, with all its gradations of Turki&s;h abu&s;e, Damus, Cucu, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That evening, as we &s;at in the caravan&s;era&punc; a man entered and &s;poke to Ha&s;&s;an, who &s;eemed to pay great attention to what he was &s;aying.&mdash;He was a well made man&mdash;below the middle &s;ize&mdash;and had that kind of countenance which be&s;peaks &s;hrewdne&s;s, ingenuity, and mirth. At length he retired; and &s;oon after Ha&s;&s;an bade us ri&s;e and follow him: he went into a &s;ort of public room, where a number of people were collected, &s;itting as is the cu&s;tom in coffee-hou&s;es on low &s;tools. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;an pointed to me to &s;it down, which I did: then placing the Interpreter near us, he &s;at him&s;elf: and &s;traight I perceived the little man, who had ju&s;t been &s;peaking to him, &s;tep forth from the crowd and begin to pronounce a &s;ort of prologue, which I neither under&s;tood nor wi&s;hed to under|&s;tand: it appeared from his cadences to be metrical, and &s;eemed, by the little impre&s;&s;ion it made on his auditors, to have nothing particular to recommend
<PB N="261" REF="033487_0260_0FF724B829E29090">
it. At length, however, he pau&s;ed, and, hem|ming &s;everal times to clear his pipes, began again to hold forth. "He is going to tell a &s;tory," &s;aid the Interpreter. The attention of all was fixed upon him, and he proceeded with a modulation of tones, a variety of action, and an energy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, that I think I have never heard or &s;een excelled: his action indeed was &s;ingularly admira|ble; and I could perceive that he was occa&s;ionally &s;peaking in the tones of a man and a woman: in which latter character he gave a picture of whining ludicrous di&s;tre&s;s, that moved the ri&s;ible mu&s;cles of all the company. I looked at Ha&s;&s;an, and he was grinning as merrily as could any monkey or Frank in A&s;ia. The Lingui&s;t occa&s;ionally inter|preted what the &s;tory-teller was &s;aying; and I &s;oon began to &s;u&s;pect that it was a &s;tory I had more than once read in the Arabian Nights, though altered, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure dramatized by the &s;peaker. I looked &s;everal times archly at Ha&s;&s;an, and he re|turned my glance, as much as to &s;ay, You &s;ee I don't laugh at all this. At length, however, the orator came to a part where he was to mimic a poor little hunch back (for I now di&s;covered it to be the &s;tory of little Hunch-back) choking with a bone: he threw up his back; &s;queezed till all the blood in his body &s;eemed collected in his face, his eyes rolled in their &s;ockets, his knees knocked, he twi&s;ted and folded his body, putting his fore finger, and thumb into his throat, and pull|ing with all his might, as if to pull &s;omething out: at length he grew weaker, &s;tretched his arms down, and his fingers back, like tho&s;e of a per&s;on &s;tranggling&mdash;kicked, fell, quivered, and died. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any de&s;cription to do ju&s;tice to the perfection of his acting; and what rendered it the more extraordinary was, that though it was a &s;cene of death, and well acted death he continued to render it &s;o ludicrous in circum&s;tances,
<PB N="262" REF="033487_0261_0FF724BAD333EC90">
as to &s;u&s;pend the audience between a laugh and cry. They did not remain long &s;o; for he &s;udden|ly bounced up, and began the mo&s;t doleful lamen|tation of a woman, and exhibited &s;uch a &s;cene of burle&s;que di&s;tre&s;s as I never witne&s;&s;ed. All bur&s;t out in torrents of laughter, Ha&s;&s;an as well as the re&s;t&mdash;I alone remained purpo&s;ely &s;erious; and the orator, according to cu&s;tom, broke off in the mid|dle of an intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>When we returned to the caravan&s;era, I rallied the Tartar on the &s;core of his laughter: he growled, and &s;aid, "who could avoid it? Why did not you laugh as you were wont?"&mdash;<Q>Becau&s;e, &s;aid I, he did not act as cornically as you.</Q>&mdash;"No," returned he, "but becau&s;e Franks and monkies on|ly laugh for mi&s;chief, and where they ought not. No, Jimmel, you will never &s;ee me laugh at mi&s;|chief."&mdash;"What," &s;aid I, "not a a poor man's being choked to death!"&mdash;"Nay," &s;aid he, "I &s;eldom laugh, Yet I could not avoid it then." That very hour, however, a puppet-&s;how was exhibited in the &s;ame room, and my grave guide laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and his voice &s;unk into a warning treble. <HI>Kara ghu&s;e</HI> was certainly extravagantly comical, though filthy; and frighten|ed a cad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a whole troop of Jani&s;&s;aries, by letting fly at them a &s;hot or two&mdash;<HI>a parte po&s;t</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The next day we &s;et out well mounted, and pu&s;h|ed on with renovated &s;pirits towards Bagdad.&mdash; Ha&s;&s;an could no more have the a&s;&s;urance to cen&s;ure laughing and, as I was little di&s;po&s;ed to do it in time of danger, we were likely to agree well. In &s;hort, we began to like one another's company; and if I brought him to be a greater laugher than he u&s;ed to be, he gave him&s;elf the credit of having made me much more &s;erious than I had been before&mdash;I pro|filed by his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>It would be an effort as idle and fruitle&s;s on my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntertaining and unintere&s;ting on yours,

to attempt to give you a regular detail of our pro|gre&s;s from Mo&s;ul to Bagdad; the &s;ame general cau|tions were ob&s;erved, with the &s;ame occa&s;ional re|laxations. Ha&s;&s;an &s;till continued to treat me with a repetition of him&s;elf and his hor&s;e, his own feats and his hor&s;e's feats; to be &s;ilent when ill-tempered, and loquacious when gay; to flog the attendants at the caravan&s;eras; order the be&s;t hor&s;es, and eat the be&s;t victuals, and to give me the be&s;t of both; and finally we had our fallings out and fallings in again: but I had not the mortification of &s;eeing any more women tied in &s;acks on hor&s;e's backs, and excoria|ted with a ride of fifty miles a day.</P>
<P>As we rode along we overtook &s;everal times &s;traggling callenders, a kind of Mahomedan monks, who profe&s;s poverty and great &s;anctity; they were dre&s;&s;ed all in rags, covered with filth, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ried a gourd, by way of bottle, for water&mdash;I pre&s;ume &s;ometimes for wine too&mdash;and bore in their hands a long pole decorated with rags, and pieces of cloth of various colours.

<HEAD>A JOURNEY TO INDIA, &amp;c. PART III.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FREDERICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing through an immen&s;e tract of country, di&s;tingui&s;hed by nothing that could &s;erve even as a circum&s;tance to mark and remember our daily journeys, but which I ob&s;erved to grow manife&s;tly wor&s;e, both in &s;oil and climate, as we proceeded Southward, we came in fight of the fa|mous city of Bagdad, on the &s;eventh day from that on which we left Mo&s;ul, and on the eighteenth from that of my departure from Aleppo; in which eighteen days we had rode fourteen hundred miles, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly through a route which no European, I have rea&s;on to believe, ever took before.</P>
<P>On entering the city, I de&s;ired my guide to con|duct me to the hou&s;e of a Merchant, to whom I had got letters of credit and introduction. He took me accordingly through the windings of &s;everal &s;treets, and at la&s;t &s;topped at the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of an Arme|nian Merchant, or <HI>Coja,</HI> where he made me alight, and come in. I was received with great politene&s;s; and, on producing my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ound that he was not the per&s;on to whom it was directed: I accord|ingly
<PB N="266" REF="033487_0265_0FF724C698C585B0">
made a &s;uitable apology, and was for retiring to find the hou&s;e of the proper per&s;on, for which purpo&s;e the Armenian offered me a &s;ervant, when, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, my Tartar interfered; &s;aid that it was to this Merchant he brought all his goods, and that I mu&s;t remain where I was; at the &s;ame time ordering the Armenian, in a peremptory tone, to take charge of me, and u&s;e me well. It was in vain that the Armenian endeavoured to ex|plain to him the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I in&s;i&s;ted I mu&s;t go to the other Merchant&mdash;HASSAN was peremptory, and declared that I &s;hould not. It was &s;o extremely <HI>outre</HI> and ridiculous, that I could not be angry; and the good Armenian unit|ing his voice with that of the Tartar, and entreat|ing me to favour him with my company, I acqui|e&s;ced, and indeed remained in his hou&s;e all the time I was at Bagdad. This was proof po&s;itive, if any other than I already had was wanting, that he con&s;idered me merely as a piece of merchandi&s;e, which he was bound (according to the language of Merchants) to deliver in good order and con|dition.</P>
<P>I had undertaken, before leaving Aleppo, to give the guide, if he acted conformably to my wi&s;hes, and behaved well, twenty pounds over and above the hundred provided by the agreement: I therefore &s;ent for him, to &s;ettle finally, and part. He had heard that I was a per&s;on different from what he had &s;uppo&s;ed me to be: but it did not alter his conduct, as might be expected, or make him &s;toop to cringing; he &s;till &s;poke with the &s;ame hone&s;t, bold familiarity; and when I gave him the promi&s;ed twenty pounds, he never hinted, cringed for, or even looked as if he expected more: but when we came to part, the feelings he di&s;clo&s;ed, and tho&s;e I my&s;elf felt, convinced me, that Man is not naturally that brute which prejudice has made him; and, when left to his own operations,
<PB N="267" REF="033487_0266_0FF724C922678690">
the human heart would be uniformly kindly, affec|tionate, and &s;ympathetic: the poor, rough, un|poli&s;hed Turk, betrayed the &s;tronge&s;t marks of &s;en&s;ibility, and I my&s;elf once more felt the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of parting.</P>
<P>I think this is the proper place to give you my opinion of the Turks, while the recollection of hone&s;t HASSAN is fre&s;h in my mind; and I cannot do it better than by quoting the words of an excel|lent French Writer&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Turks (&s;ays M. du LOIR) are naturally a good people, which is not to be a&s;cribed to the cli|mate; for the Greeks born in the &s;ame climate have very different di&s;po&s;itions, and retain only the bad qualities of their ance&s;tors, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">z. roguery, treachery, and vanity. The Turks, on the contrary, priding them&s;elves on their integrity and mode&s;ty, are di&s;|tingui&s;hed in general by an open, ingenuous &s;im|plicity of manners; courtiers only excepted, who, in Turkey, as every where el&s;e, are the &s;laves of ambition and avarice."</P>
<P>The name of Bagdad has been &s;o renowned in Ea&s;tern &s;tory, and is the &s;cene of &s;o many of tho&s;e bewitching tales which we find tran&s;lated, or pre|tended to be tran&s;lated, from the Arabic and Per|&s;ian, that I felt great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing it, and con|ceived my&s;elf to be at the very fountain-head of marvellous adventure and romance. Fraught with this idea, I was impatient to go forth into the town; and notwith&s;tanding the weather was be|yond conception hot, I paraded a number of &s;treets: but never did I, in the cour&s;e of my life, &s;ee a place &s;o calculated to belie the opinion one would form of it from the ea&s;tern tales. It appeared to me to be among the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable cities of the world, and has no one circum&s;tance that I could di&s;cover to recommend it: the heat is &s;o great, that in the Summer-time the inhabitants are forced to keep their markets in the night, and to lie
<PB N="268" REF="033487_0267_0FF724CC1220C328">
all night in the open air, on the terraces of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Armenian with whom I re&s;ided, did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable to me; and I &s;hall always retain a lively &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s and ho&s;pitality: he was not only generous and polite, but well informed, and plea&s;ing in con|ver&s;ation. I took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s to him the di&s;appointment I felt at finding Bagdad &s;o very dif|ferent from what I expected; and told him that I had, when a youth, learned to think highly of it, or rather romantically, from reading Ea&s;tern tales. This led to a conver&s;ation on the Arabian Nights Entertainments, a copy of which he had in the Arabic, and produced it: he then &s;hewed me, with great triumph, a French tran&s;lation of them, print|ed at Paris, which he had read, and declared that the tran&s;lation was nothing it all in compari&s;on with the original. I believe he was well qualified to judge, for he was a perfect ma&s;ter of the French language.</P>
<P>We talked of the Ea&s;tern tale of the Gla&s;s Man, who, in a reverie, increa&s;es his &s;tock till he gets &s;o rich as, in imagination, to marry the Cadi's daughter, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in kicking his wife, kicks all his gla&s;&s;es about, and de&s;troys the whole of his vi&s;ionary fortune. I prai&s;ed the humour of it much &mdash;"Sir," &s;aid he, "there is nothing in it that may not be experienced frequently in actual life: tho&s;e waking dreams are the u&s;ual concomitants of opium: a man who has accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to the pernici|cious practice of eating opium, is con&s;tantly &s;ub|ject to them.

to all about him. I have &s;een &s;ome indulg|ing in the blandi&s;hments of love with Prince&s;&s;es, and others wallowing in the wealth of Golconda. But the mo&s;t extr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ordinary vi&s;ionary of this kind I ever met with, was one who imagined him&s;elf tran&s;lated to Paradi&s;e, co-equal to Mahomet, and &s;itting by the &s;ide of that prophet, arguing with him in defence of the u&s;e of wine and opium: he argued mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly, li&s;tened in &s;ilence to the &s;uppo&s;ed arguments of his adver&s;ary, an&s;wered them, replied, rejoined, and &s;till argued on&mdash;till, growing at la&s;t angry, he &s;wore that he was as good a prophet as him, did not care a fig for him, and called him fool and fal&s;e prophet. A Turk who was pre&s;ent, in the fulne&s;s of his zeal, laid a &s;tick very heavily acro&s;s his &s;houlders, and put an end to the vi&s;ion: and never did I &s;ee a wretch &s;o abject, &s;o forlorn, or &s;o mi&s;erably de&s;ponding; he put his forehead to the ground, which he wet with his tears, crying, Mercy, Mahomet! mercy, holy Prophet! mercy, Alla!&mdash;nor could he find relief (&s;uch is the ruin of opium) till he got a fre&s;h &s;upply of it in his mouth, which &s;oon gave him a temporary re&s;pite from the horrors of his &s;ituation."</P>
<P>Unque&s;tionably, Bagdad was once a great city, of flouri&s;hing commerce; but the Sultan AMU|RATH the Fourth, when he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, put the riche&s;t Merchants &s;ettled there to death; and it has ever &s;ince gradually declined. About two days journey from it, lie the ruins of the once famous city of Babylon. I was much di&s;|po&s;ed to go to &s;ee it, and thence drop down the Euphrates to Ba&s;&s;ora: but my Armenian ho&s;t told me there was nothing in it to recompen&s;e a per&s;on for half the trouble; for, of that magnificent city, which was &s;ixty m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les in circumference, which was encompa&s;&s;ed with walls eighty-&s;even feet in thickne&s;s, and three hundred and fifty in height, nothing was to be &s;een but the bare foundations of
<PB N="270" REF="033487_0269_0FF724FF8431DA40">
&s;ome great edifices. The Tower of Belus, and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, lie with the re&s;t in un|di&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. The greate&s;t curio&s;ities, then, were, in the fir&s;t place, the ruins of a building &s;aid to be the famed Tower of Babel, which ap|peared to have been half a league in compa&s;s; and the remains of a va&s;t bridge over the Euphrates, where it is half a league broad.</P>
<P>I was not more anxious to arrive at the city of Bagdad than I was to leave it; and having written letters, and put them in a way of being forwarded to Europe, I took leave of my friendly ho&s;pitable Armenian, and, with a thou&s;and acknowledgments for his kindne&s;s, &s;et out on hor&s;eback to a place on the Tigris, where I embarked in a boat, in order to proceed to Ba&s;&s;ora. This river, known &s;ince the fir&s;t records of human exi&s;tence by Geogra|phers, is remarkable for its rapidity, whence, PLINY &s;ays, it has the name of Tigris, (in the Median language, a dart); and for its extraordinary cour&s;e, which is in many places under ground, ri&s;es in Armenia, &s;inks into the earth near mount Taurus, and runs under a mountain&mdash;then ri&s;ing at the other &s;ide, follows its cour&s;e through the lake The&s;pites&mdash;again &s;inks frequently under ground, and continues hid at one time for a &s;pace of twen|ty-five miles; where, once more emerging, it glides along wiih a very rapid &s;tream, meets the Euphrates at a place called Korna, pa&s;&s;es through Ba&s;&s;ora, and falls into the Per&s;ian Gulph.</P>
<P>As the boat in which I took my pa&s;&s;age had no convenience for excluding the violence of the &s;un, except an awning, I &s;uffered extremely from the heat. The River it&s;elf was grand; but the banks, and contiguous country, contained nothing to at|tract notice&mdash;no object to diver&s;ify the dreary, de|&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a&s;pect of the &s;cene&mdash;nothing to afford room for reflection, or give birth to a new idea. I do not remember to have ever pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a
<PB N="271" REF="033487_0270_0FF67BAB8F2BC230">
va&s;t extent of country, &s;o uniformly dull and unin|tere&s;ting. The only thing that &s;erved to keep the mind alive, was the apprehen&s;ion of robbers, who, in great numbers, hover over this river, and plun|der pa&s;&s;engers. We had taken care, on leaving Bagdad, to be well provided with fire-arms; and they did us yeomen's &s;ervice&mdash;for we were fre|quently attacked by robbers with a view to plun|der, but found that a &s;hot or two di&s;per&s;ed and &s;ent them off in con&s;ternation. One night, however, in pa&s;&s;ing a creek, we perceived &s;everal boats i&s;&s;u|ing from it, in great order, and in a manner that evinced method and premeditation: we &s;ilently prepared for their reception, and were completely ready to meet them warmly, while they thought us quite unprepared, and uncon&s;cious of their ap|proach: they fir&s;t endeavoured to board us by &s;ur|pri&s;e: wi&s;hing rather to frighten than to kill them, we began by firing over their heads; on which they &s;et up the mo&s;t horrible &s;houts, and ru&s;hed on with a tumultuous rapidity, making the mo&s;t terrible noi&s;e in order to intimidate us: they were by this time quite near us; we therefore took aim at them, and let fly, and immediately perceived them in great confu&s;ion, &s;ome of the boats lo&s;ing their helm, and falling with the &s;tream on the others: at la&s;t we &s;aw them &s;heer off, and they gave us no farther trouble.</P>

The Engli&s;h and Dutch have factories here, as well for the purpo&s;e of commerce, as the tran&s;it of di&s;patches, by way of Dama&s;cus and Aleppo, to Europe. The Riche&s;t merchandi&s;e of India and Europe are brought here in caravans; and its opulence is greatly increa&s;ed by the caravans of Pilgrims, who pa&s;s through it on their way to Mecca, and pay great duties, bartering for many rich commodities. The hor&s;es of this place are ce|lebrated for their &s;uperior excellence: it is &s;aid that they will run thirty hours without meat or drink&mdash;I doubt the fact, and &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o inhuman an experiment tried.</P>
<P>One comfortable circum&s;tance attending Ba&s;&s;ora is, that at night the &s;treets may be walked with perfect &s;afety at all hours. It is &s;ubject to an Arab Prince, who is tributary to the Turk, and who&s;e revenue is very great, as well from the above-men|tioned cau&s;es, as becau&s;e he gives full liberty to all Nations to come and trade to his capital.</P>
<P>From Ba&s;&s;ora I took my pa&s;&s;age in a date-boat going to Mu&s;kat, expecting to get from thence a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age to Bombay: but the boat &s;prung a leak at &s;ea, and we were obliged to run into Bu&s;|heer, where I was very ho&s;pitably received and

entertained by Mr. GALLEY, the Company's Re|&s;ident.</P>
<P>There really &s;eemed to be an unu&s;ual fatality at|tending me throughout the whole of my journey. You will recollect, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I was pre|vented, by the war with France, from going by the direct route which I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have taken, and obliged to pa&s;s through the Low Coun|tries and Germany&mdash;In the next place, at Venice I was di&s;appointed in obtaining a pa&s;&s;age to Lata|chaea; and, immediately on the heels of that, lo&s;t my &s;ervant at Trie&s;te, by &s;ending him for letters to Venice&mdash;Afterwards, when I had gone to Alex|andria with expectation of travelling through Egypt, and viewing that intere&s;ting part of the world, I found my&s;elf prevented by the unhappy circum|&s;tances of the country&mdash;the plague raging in Alex|andria, and all the roads being blocked up by an incur&s;ion of the Arabs. Thus mortified and di&s;|appointed, I turned about, in order to make my way in another direction; and arriving at Cyprus, found, to my infinite &s;urpri&s;e and regret, that an epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, little &s;hort of the plague, pre|vailed there, and &s;wept off the inhabitants in great numbers: when, after &s;urmounting all tho&s;e ob&s;ta|cles, I arrived at Aleppo, the fir&s;t information I got was, that the caravan was gone, and that it would be a long time before another would be ready; and my departure from Aleppo was attended with circum&s;tances no le&s;s inau&s;picious than my en|trance&mdash;At Mo&s;ul I experienced another di&s;ap|pointment, by the river's being dried up, and ren|dered impracticable by boats&mdash;My pa&s;&s;age from Ba&s;&s;ora to Mu&s;kat was impeded by the ve&s;&s;el &s;pring|ing a leak&mdash;And now, when at la&s;t I hoped to get from Bu&s;heer to Bombay, I was &s;topped by the intelligence that the Gulph was blocked up by French privateers, in&s;omuch as no ve&s;&s;el could hope to e&s;cape, I was therefore obliged to remain at

Bu&s;heer, till a Company's frigate, commanded by Captain HARDY, and &s;oon expected &s;hould afford me an opportunity of proceeding to Bombay. Time, however, brought that period about; and I took my pa&s;&s;age, and arrived &s;afe at Bombay, where I &s;oon after embarked on board a Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;el, being the only conveyance that offered for me to proceed to Madras: &s;he was fir&s;t bound to Goa, and we arrived &s;afely at that i&s;land, where I was received with great politene&s;s, and treated with the mo&s;t friendly attention, by Mr. HENSHAW, the Engli&s;h Re&s;ident.</P>
<P>Goa belongs to the Portugue&s;e: the Viceroy of the Nation lives there in great pomp. It was once the &s;cene of the mo&s;t abominable cruelties, exer|ci&s;ed by that flagitious people on the natives, under pretended ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l for Chri&s;tianity&mdash;I had read the Abb&egrave; RAYNAL'S glowing de&s;cription of it; and as I trod the ground, my frame trembled at the thoughts of the ma&s;&s;acres perpetrated there.</P>
<P>I was impatient to get from Goa, and yet I look|ed forward to my departure with a &s;ecret unea&s;i|ne&s;s, for which I was entirely unable to account&mdash; I wi&s;hed to proceed, and yet &s;ome &s;ecret foreboding whi&s;pered to my heart that I was on the verge of calamity: &s;o powerful was it, and &s;o ob&s;tinate, that I could neither rea&s;on away its admonitions, nor re&s;i&s;t its impre&s;&s;ions; and &s;omething ince&s;tant|ly told me, in as plain language as if a human be|ing &s;poke, that I &s;hould &s;uffer a dreadful misfor|tune. As I had all my life been an enemy to &s;uper&s;tition, I felt my &s;pirit in&s;ulted, and my under&s;tanding degraded, by the involuntary victory which I allowed to this impre&s;&s;ion&mdash;I combated it with rea&s;on, with ridicule, with &s;elf-contempt &mdash;all in vain: in &s;pite of me, I became the very &s;lave of gloomy pre&s;entiment; and in order to get the &s;uccedaneous aid of a friend's rea&s;on, as well as to be prepared, I communicated the &s;tate of my
<PB N="275" REF="033487_0274_0FF724DB61BDF080">
feelings to Mr. HENSHAW. In vain he endea|voured to cheer me: all he could do was to give me his coun&s;el; in con&s;equence of which I actu|ally &s;ettled all my affairs up to that day, made my will, left it with Mr. HENSHAW, and, full of dreadful forebodings of &s;hipwreck, went on board a Portugue&s;e &s;now bound to Madras.</P>
<P>It was now the eighteenth day of May when we &s;ailed from Goa. The hemi&s;phere had been for &s;ome days overca&s;t with clouds: &s;ome light &s;howers of rain had fallen; and you may conclude that it did not tend to rai&s;e my &s;pirits, or free me from ominous apprehen&s;ions, to hear that tho&s;e circum&s;tances indicated an approaching gale of wind. I ob&s;erved, moreover, that the ve&s;&s;el was much too deep in the water, being greatly over|loaded&mdash;that &s;he was in many re&s;pects defective, and, as the &s;eamen &s;ay, ill-found, and in &s;hort ve|ry unfit to encounter a gale of wind of any vio|lence. I &s;corned, however, to yield to tho&s;e united impre&s;&s;ions, and determined to proceed.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth, the &s;ky was ob&s;cured by immen&s;e fleeces of clouds, &s;urcharged with inflam|mable matter; and in the evening, the rain fell in torrents, the firmament darkened apace, &s;udden night came on, and the horrors of extreme dark|ne&s;s were rendered &s;till more horrible by the peals of thunder which rent the air, and the frequent fla&s;hes of lightning, which &s;erved only to &s;hew us the horror of our &s;ituation, and leave us in increa|&s;ed darkne&s;s: mean-time the wind became more violent, blowing on the &s;hore; and a heavy &s;ea, rai&s;ed by its force, united with it to make our &s;tate more formidable.</P>
<P>By day-light on the morning of the twentieth, the gale had encrea&s;ed to a furious tempe&s;t; and the &s;ea, keeping pace with it, ran mountain-high; and as it kept invariably to the &s;ame point, the Cap|tain and Officers became &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and al|mo&s;t
<PB N="276" REF="033487_0275_0FF724DCEE7B75B8">
per&s;uaded that the South-We&s;t Mon&s;oon had &s;et in, which, if it were &s;o, would render it ab&s;olute|ly impo&s;&s;ible for us to weather the coa&s;t. All that day, however, we kept as clo&s;e as the violence of the weather would allow us to the wind; but the &s;ea canted her head &s;o to leeward, that &s;he made more lee than head-way; and the rigging was &s;o &s;trained with the work that we had little hope of keeping off the &s;hore, unle&s;s the wind changed, of which there was not now the &s;malle&s;t probability. During the night there was no intermi&s;&s;ion of the &s;torm: many of the &s;ails flew into ribbons; &s;ome of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igging was carried away; and &s;uch exertions were made, that, before morning, every &s;tick that could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;truck was down upon the deck.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock on the morning of the twen|ty-fir&s;t, I was alarmed by an un&s;ual noi&s;e upon the deck, and running up, perceived that every remaining &s;ail in the ve&s;&s;el, the fore-&s;ail alone ex|cepted, was totally carried away. The &s;ight was hor|rible; and the whole ve&s;&s;el pre&s;ented a &s;pectacle as dreadful to the feelings as mortifying to human pride. Fear had produced, not only all the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of de&s;pondency, but all the mi&s;chievous freaks of in|&s;anity. In one place &s;tood the Captain, raving, &s;tamping, and tearing his hair in handfuls from his head&mdash;here &s;ome of the crew were ca&s;t upon their knees, clapping their hands, and praying, with all the extravagance of horror painted in their faces &mdash; there, others were flogging their images with all their might, calling upon them to allay the &s;torm. One of our pa&s;&s;engers, who was Pur&s;er of an En|gli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indiaman, had got hold of a ca&s;e-bottle of rum, and, with an air of di&s;traction and deep de&s;pair imprinted in his face, was &s;talking about in his &s;hirt. I perceived him to be on the point of &s;erving it about, in large tumblers, to the few un|di&s;mayed people; and well convinced, that, &s;o far from alleviating, it would &s;harpen the horrors of
<PB N="277" REF="033487_0276_0FF724E0F9A06548">
their mind, I went forward, and with much diffi|culty prevented him.</P>
<P>Having accompli&s;hed this point, I applied my|&s;elf to the Captain, and endeavoured to bring h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m back (if po&s;&s;ible) to his recollection, and to a &s;en&s;e of what he owed to his duty as a commander, and to his dignity as a man: I exhorted him to encou|rage the &s;ailors by his example; and &s;trove to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, by &s;aying that the &s;torm did not appear to me by any means &s;o terrible as &s;ome I had before experienced.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed, we &s;hipped a &s;ea on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, which I really thought would have &s;ent us down. The ve&s;&s;el &s;eemed to &s;ink beneath its weight, &s;hivered, and remained moti|onle&s;s&mdash;it was a moment of critical &s;u&s;pen&s;e: fancy made me think I felt her gradually de&s;cending&mdash;I gave my&s;elf up as gone, and &s;ummoned all my for|titude to bear approaching death with becoming manhood.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this cri&s;is, the water, which ru&s;hed with incredible force through all parts of the ve&s;&s;el, brought out floating, and nearly &s;uffocated, another Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;enger, who was endeavouring to take a little repo&s;e in a &s;mall cabin boarded off from the deck: he was a very &s;tout young man, and full of true &s;pirit. Finding that the ve&s;&s;el was not, as I had thought, going immediately down, he joined me in exhorting the captain to his duty: we per|&s;uaded him to throw the guns overboard, as well as a number of trunks and packages with which the ve&s;&s;el was much encumbered; and with &s;ome little exertion, we got the pumps &s;et agoing.</P>
<P>Here I will &s;top, knowing the warm &s;en&s;ibility of my FREDERICK'S mind; and, convinced that his &s;ympathetic heart will go hand-in-hand with his Father's &s;uffering's, I will not overcharge it with grief by an immediate continuation of the bu&s;ine&s;s, but defer it to another Letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>THE name of the Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;enger, whom I mentioned to you in my la&s;t Letter as a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing me in getting the Captain and Mariners to do their duty, was HALL. He was a young man of a mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and with it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that manly &s;pirit that gives pre&s;ence of mind in exigences of danger. He and I having, with great difficulty, got &s;ome hands to &s;tick to the pumps, &s;tood at the wheel, at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t the men, and prevent them from quitting it; and, although hopele&s;s, determined that no effort practicable on our parts &s;hould be wanting to the pre&s;ervation of the ve&s;&s;el. The water, however, gained upon the pumps, notwith&s;tanding every effort; and it evi|dently appeared that we could not keep her long above water.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock the wind &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and amounted to a downright hurricane: the &s;ky was &s;o entirely ob&s;cured with black clouds, and the rain fell &s;o thick, that objects were not di&s;cernable from the wheel to the &s;hip's head. Soon the pumps were choaked, and could no longer be worked: then di&s;may &s;eized on all&mdash;nothing but unutterable de&s;pair, &s;ilent angui&s;h, and horror, wrought up to frenzy, was to be &s;een; not a &s;in|gle &s;oul was capable of an effort to be u&s;eful&mdash;all &s;eemed more de&s;irous to extingui&s;h their calamities by embracing death, than willing, by a painful exertion, to avoid it.</P>
<P>At about eleven o'clock we could plainly di&s;tin|gui&s;h a dreadful roaring noi&s;e, re&s;embling that of waves rolling again&s;t rocks; but the darkne&s;s of
<PB N="279" REF="033487_0278_0FF724E63631DEF0">
the day, and the accompanying rains, prevented us from &s;eeing any di&s;tance; and if they were rocks, we might be actually da&s;hed to pieces on them before we could perceive them. At twelve o'clock, however, the weather cleared up a little, and both the wind and the &s;ea &s;eemed to have aba|ted: the very expan&s;ion of the pro&s;pect round the &s;hip was exhilerating; and as the weather grew better, and the &s;ea le&s;s furious, the &s;en&s;es of the people returned, and the general &s;tupefaction be|gan to decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The weather continuing to clear up, we in &s;ome time di&s;covered breakers and large rocks without &s;ide of us; &s;o that it appeared we mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed quite clo&s;e to them, and were now fairly hemmed in between them and the land.</P>
<P>In this very critical juncture, the Captain, en|tirely contrary to my opinion, adopted the danger|ous re&s;olution of letting go an anchor, to bring her up with her head to the &s;ea: But, though no &s;ea|man, my common &s;en&s;e told me that &s;he could never ride it out, but mu&s;t directly go down. The event nearly ju&s;tified my judgment; for &s;he had &s;carcely been at anchor before an enormous &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rolling over her, overwhelmed and filled her with water, and every one on board concluded that &s;he was certainly &s;inking&mdash;On the in&s;tant, a La&s;car, with a pre&s;ence of mind worthy an old Engli&s;h mariner, took an axe, ran forward, and cut the cable.</P>
<P>On finding her&s;elf free, the ve&s;&s;el again floated, and made an effort to right her&s;elf; but &s;he was almo&s;t completely water-logged, and heeled to lar|board &s;o much that the gunnel lay under water. We then endeavoured to &s;teer as fa&s;t as we could for the land, which we knew could not be at any great di&s;tance, though we were unable to di&s;cover it through the hazy weather: the fore&s;ail was loo&s;|ened; by great efforts in balling, &s;he righted a lit|tle,
<PB N="280" REF="033487_0279_0FF724E8C4D1A868">
her gunnel was got above water, and we &s;cud|ded as well as we could before the wind, which &s;till blew hard on &s;hore; and at about two o'clock the land appeared at a &s;mall di&s;tance a head.</P>
<P>The love of life countervails all other con&s;idera|tions in the mind of man. The uncertainty we were under with regard to the &s;hore before us, which we had rea&s;on to believe was part of HYDER ALLI'S dominions, where we &s;hould meet with the mo&s;t rigorous treatment, if not ultimate death, was forgotten in the joyful hope of &s;aving life; and we &s;cudded towards the &s;hore in all the exult|ing tran&s;ports of people ju&s;t &s;natched from the jaws of death.</P>
<P>This gleam of happine&s;s continued not long: a tremendous &s;ea rolling after us, broke over our &s;tern, tore every thing before it, &s;tove in the &s;teer|age, carried away the rudder, &s;hivered the wheel to pieces, and tore up the very ring-bolts of the deck&mdash;conveyed the men who &s;tood at the wheel forward, and &s;wept them overboard. I was &s;tand|ing, at the time, near the wheel, and fortunately had hold of the taffarel, which enabled me to re&s;i&s;t in part the weight of the wave. I was, however, &s;wept off my feet, and da&s;hed again&s;t the main-ma&s;t. The jerk from the taffarel, which I hold very tenaciou&s;ly, &s;eemed as if it would have di&s;lo|cated my arms: however, it broke the impetus of my motion, and in all probability &s;aved me from being da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the ma&s;t.</P>
<P>I floundered about in the water at the foot of the ma&s;t, till at length I got on my feet, and &s;eiz|ed a rope, which I held in a &s;tate of great embar|ra&s;&s;ment, dubious what I &s;hould do to extricate my&s;elf. At this in&s;tant I perceived that Mr. HALL had got upon the cap&s;tern, and was waving his hand to me to follow his example: this I wi&s;hed to do, though it was an enterpri&s;e of &s;ome ri&s;k and difficulty; for, if I lo&s;t the hold I had, a &s;ingle
<PB N="281" REF="033487_0280_0FF724EA58B48DF0">
motion of the ve&s;&s;el, or a full wave, would cer|tainly carry me overboard. I made a bold pu&s;h, however, and fortunately accompli&s;hed it. Having attained this &s;tation, I could the better &s;urvey the wreck, and &s;aw that the water was nearly brea&s;t-high on the quarter-deck, (for the ve&s;&s;el was deep-wai&s;ted); and I perceived the unfortunate Engli&s;h Pur&s;er &s;tanding where the water was mo&s;t &s;hallow, as if watching with patient expectation its ri&s;ing, and awating death: I called to him to come to us, but he &s;hook his head in de&s;pair, and &s;aid, in a lamentable tone, "It is all over with us! GOD have mercy upon us!"&mdash;then &s;eated him&s;elf with &s;eeming compo&s;ure on a chair which happened to be rolling about in the wreck of the deck, and in a few minutes afterwards was wa&s;hed into the &s;ea along with it, where he was &s;peedily relea&s;ed from a &s;tate ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>During this univer&s;al wreck of things, the hor|ror I was in could not prevent me from ob&s;erving a very curious circum&s;tance, which at any other time would have excited laughter, though now it pro|duced no other emotion than &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;We hap|pened to be in part laden with mangoes, of which the i&s;land of Goa is known to produce the fine&s;t in the world; &s;ome of them lay in ba&s;kets on the poop; a little black boy, in the moment of greate&s;t danger, had got &s;eated by them, devouring them voraciou&s;ly, and crying all the time mo&s;t bitterly at the horrors of his &s;ituation!</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el now got completely water-logged; and Mr. HALL and I were employed in forming conjectural calculations how many minutes &s;he could keep above water, and con&s;oling one another on the unfortunate circum&s;tances under which we met&mdash; lamenting that fate had thus brought us acquainted only to make us witne&s;&s;es of each other's mi&s;ery, and then to &s;ee one another no more.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="033487_0281_0FF724ED35C7A3A0">As the larboard &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el was gradually going down, the deck, and of cour&s;e the cap&s;tern, became too nearly perpendicular for us to continue on it: we therefore fore&s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of quit|ting it, and got upon the &s;tarboard &s;ide, holding fa&s;t by the gunnel, and allowing our bodies and legs to yield to the &s;ea as it broke over us. Thus we continued for &s;ome time: at length the &s;everity of the labour &s;o entirely exhau&s;ted our &s;trength and &s;pirits, that our be&s;t hope &s;eemed to be a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion to our painful death; and we began to have &s;erious intentions of letting go our hold, and yielding our&s;elves up at once to the fury of the waves.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el, which all this time drifted with the &s;ea and wind, gradually approximated the &s;hore, and at length &s;truck the ground, which for an in|&s;tant revived our almo&s;t departed hopes; but we &s;oon found that it did not in the &s;malle&s;t degree better our &s;ituation&mdash;Again I began to yield to utter de&s;pair&mdash;again I thought of letting go my hold, and &s;inking at once: It is impo&s;&s;ible thought I ever to e&s;cape&mdash;why, then, prolong, for a few minutes, a painful exi&s;tence that mu&s;t at la&s;t be given up? Yet, yet, the all-&s;ubduing love of life &s;ugge&s;ted, that many things apparently impo&s;&s;ible had come to pa&s;s; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, If life is to be lo&s;t, why not lo&s;e it in a glorious &s;truggle? Should I &s;urvive it by accident, life will be ren|dered doubly &s;weet to me, and I &s;till more worthy of it by per&s;evering fortitude.</P>
<P>While I was employed in this train of reflection, I perceived &s;ome of the people collecting together, talking, and holding a con&s;ultation&mdash;It immedi|ately occurred to me, that they were devi&s;ing &s;ome plan for e&s;caping from the wreck, and get|ting on &s;hore: and, &s;o natural is it for man to cling to his fellow-creature for &s;upport in difficult or dangerous exigences, I propo&s;ed to Mr. HALL to
<PB N="283" REF="033487_0282_0FF724F0B86243E0">
join them, and take a &s;hare in the execution of the plan&mdash;ob&s;erving to him at the &s;ame time, that I was determined at all events to quit the ve&s;&s;el, and tru&s;t to the protection and guidance of a &s;uperintending Providence for the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>AS prodigality of life is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the exce&s;s of virtue and courage&mdash;&s;o there are others in which it is vice, meanne&s;s and cowardice. True courage is, according to the circum&s;tances under which it is to operate, as rigidly tenacious and vigilant of life in one ca&s;e, as it is indifferent and regardle&s;s in another; and I think it is a very &s;trange contradiction in the human heart (although it often happens), that a man who has the mo&s;t un|bounded courage, in &s;eeking death even in the can|non's mouth, &s;hall yet want the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;olu|tion to make exertions to &s;ave his life in ca&s;es of ordinary danger. The unfortunate Engli&s;h Pur&s;er could not collect courage &s;ufficient to make an effort to &s;ave him&s;elf; and yet I think it probable that he would have faced a battery of artillery, or expo&s;ed him&s;elf to a pi&s;tol-&s;hot, if occa&s;ion required, as &s;oon as any other man. Thus it appears at fir&s;t view: but may not this &s;eeming incongruity be explained by &s;aying, that per&s;onal courage and for|titude are different qualities of the mind and body, and depend upon the exerci&s;e of entirely different functions?</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I argued with my&s;elf, in the height of my calamitous &s;ituation, upon the &s;ub|ject of fortitude and dejection, courage and cow|ardice; and, nothwith&s;tanding the &s;erious a&s;pect of
<PB N="284" REF="033487_0283_0FF724F251D49B10">
affairs, found my&s;elf li&s;tening to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pride: What a paltry thing to yield, while &s;trength is left to &s;truggle! Vanity her&s;elf had her hint, and whi&s;pered, "Should I e&s;cape by an effort of my own, what a glorious theme of exultation!" There were, I confe&s;s, tran&s;itory images in my mind, which, co-operating with the natural at|tachment to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, made me per&s;evere, and re&s;olve to do &s;o, while one ve&s;tige of hope was left for the mind to dwell on.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, as I told you before, the people con|&s;ulting together, and re&s;olving to join them, I made an effort to get to the lee &s;hrouds, where they were &s;tanding, or rather clinging; but before I could accompli&s;h it, I lo&s;t my hold, fell down the hatch|way (the gratings having been carried away with the long-boat), and was for &s;ome minutes entangled there among&s;t a heap of packages, which the vio|lent fluctuations of the water had collected on the lee &s;ide. As the ve&s;&s;el moved with the &s;ea, and the water flowed in, the packages and I were roll|ed together&mdash;&s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes another, uppermo&s;t; &s;o that I began to be apprehen&s;ive I &s;hould not be able to extricate my&s;elf: by the mere&s;t accident, however, I gra&s;ped &s;omething that lay in my way, made a vigorous &s;pring, and gained the lee &s;hrouds. Mr. HALL, who followed me, in &s;eizing the &s;hrouds, came thump again&s;t me with &s;uch violence that I could &s;carcely retain my hold of the rigging. Compelled by the peri|lous &s;ituation in which I &s;tood, I called out to him for GOD'S &s;ake to keep off, for that I was rendered quite breathle&s;s and worn out: he generou&s;ly en|deavoured to make way for me, and, in doing &s;o, unfortunately lo&s;t his hold, and went down under the &s;hip's &s;ide. Never, never &s;hall I forget my &s;en&s;ations at this melancholy incident&mdash;I would have given millions of worlds that I could have recalled the words which made him move; my
<PB N="285" REF="033487_0284_0FF724F74A707C40">
mind was wound up to the la&s;t pitch of angui&s;h: I may truly &s;ay, that this was the mo&s;t bitter of all the bitter moments of my life, compared with which the other circum&s;tances of the &s;hipwreck &s;eemed le&s;&s;ened&mdash;for I had in&s;en&s;ibly acquired an unu&s;ual e&s;teem and warm attachment for him, and was doubtful whether, after being even the inno|cent occa&s;ion of his falling, I ought to take fur|ther pains to pre&s;erve my own life. All tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations were pa&s;&s;ing with the rapidity of light|ning through my thoughts, when, as much to my a&s;toni&s;hment as to my joy, I &s;aw him borne by a returning wave, and thrown among the very pack|ages from which I had but ju&s;t before, with &s;uch labour and difficulty, extricated my&s;elf&mdash;In the end he proved equally fortunate, but after a much longer and harder &s;truggle, and after &s;u&s;taining much more injury.</P>
<P>I once more changed my &s;tation, and made my way to the poop, where I found my&s;elf rather more &s;heltered&mdash;I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed Mr. HALL to be with me, whatever might be my ultimate fate &mdash;and beckoned to him to come to me; but he only an&s;wered by &s;haking his head, in a feeble, de&s;ponding manner&mdash;&s;taring at the &s;ame time wild|ly about him: even his &s;pirit was &s;ubdued; and de&s;pair, I perceived, had begun to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind.</P>
<P>Being a little more at ea&s;e in my new &s;tation than I had been before, I had more time to deliberate, and more power to judge. I recollected, that, ac|cording to the cour&s;e of time, the day was far gone, and the night quickly approaching: I reflected, that for any enterprize what&s;oever, day was much preferable to night; and above all I con&s;idered, that the ve&s;&s;el could not hold long together&mdash;I therefore thought, that the be&s;t mode I could adopt would be, to take to the water with the fir&s;t boyant thing I could &s;ee; and, as the wind and water
<PB N="286" REF="033487_0285_0FF724F8DB69DE38">
both &s;eemed to run to the &s;hore, to take my chance in that way of reaching it. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, I tore off my &s;hirt, having before that thrown off the other parts of my dre&s;s&mdash;I looked at my &s;leeve buttons, in which was &s;et the hair of my departed children&mdash;and, by an involuntary act of the imagination, a&s;ked my&s;elf the que&s;tion, "Shall I be happy enough to meet them where I am now about to go?&mdash;&s;hall tho&s;e dear la&s;t remains, too, become a prey to the devouring deep?"&mdash;In that in&s;tant, rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pended by the horrors of the &s;cene, gave way to in&s;tinct; and I rolled my &s;hirt up, and very carefully thru&s;t it into a hole between decks, with the wild hopes that the &s;leeve buttons might yet e&s;cape untouched. Watching my opportunity, I &s;aw a log of wood floating near the ve&s;&s;el, and, waving my hand to Mr. HALL as a la&s;t adieu, jumped after it. Here, again, I was doomed to aggravated hard&s;hips&mdash;I had &s;carcely touched the log when a great &s;ea &s;natched it from my hold: &s;till as it came near me, I gra&s;ped at it ineffectually, till at la&s;t it was completely carried away, but not before it had cut and battered and brui&s;ed me in &s;everal places, and in a manner that at any other time I &s;hould have thought dreadful.</P>
<P>Death &s;eemed inevitable: and all that occured to me now to do, was to acclerate it, and get out of its pangs as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for, though I knew how to &s;wim, the tremendous &s;urf rendered &s;wim|ming u&s;ele&s;s, and all hope from it would have been rediculous. I therefore began to &s;wallow as much water as po&s;&s;ible; yet, &s;till ri&s;ing by the the boyant principle of the waves to the &s;urface, my former thoughts began to recur; and whether it was that, or natural in&s;tinct, which &s;urvived the temporary impre&s;&s;ions of de&s;pair, I know not&mdash;but I endea|voured to &s;wim, which I had not done long, when I again di&s;covered the log of wood I had lo&s;t float|ing near me, and with &s;ome difficulty caught it:
<PB N="287" REF="033487_0286_0FF724FA6880B2B8">
hardly had it been an in&s;tant in my hands, when, by the &s;ame unlucky means, I lo&s;t it again. I had often heard it &s;aid in Scotland, that if a man will throw him&s;elf flat on his back in the water, lie quite &s;traight and &s;tiff, and &s;uffer him&s;elf to &s;ink till the water g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts into his ears, he will continue to float &s;o for ever; this occured to me now, and I determined to try the experiment; &s;o I threw my|&s;elf on my back in the manner I have de&s;cribed and left my&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;al of providence: nor was it long till I found the truth of the &s;aying&mdash;for I floated with hardly an effort, and began for the fir&s;t time to conceive &s;omething like hopes of pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>After lying in this manner, committed to the di&s;cretion of the tides, I &s;oon &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el&mdash;&s;aw that it was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance behind me. Livelie&s;t hope began to play about my heart, and joy fluttered with a thou&s;and gay fancies in my mind: I began to form the favourable conclu&s;ion, that the tide was carrying me rapidly to land from the ve&s;&s;el, and that I &s;hould &s;oon once more touch <HI>terra f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rma.</HI></P>
<P>This expectation was a cordial that revived my exhau&s;ted &s;pirits: I took courage, and left my&s;elf &s;till to the &s;ame all directing Power that had hitherto pre&s;erved me, &s;carcely doubting that I &s;hould &s;oon reach the land. Nor was I mi&s;taken; for, in a &s;hort time more, without effort or exertion, and without once turning from off my back, I found my&s;elf &s;trike again&s;t the &s;andy beach. Overjoyed, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, to the highe&s;t pitch of tran&s;port at my providential deliverance. I made a convul&s;ive &s;pring, and ran up a little di&s;tance on the &s;hore; but was &s;o weak and worn down by fa|tigue, and &s;o unable to clear my &s;tomach of the &s;alt water with which it was loaded, that I &s;uddenly grew deadly &s;ick, and apprehended that I had only exchanged one death for another; and in a minute or two fainted away.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT admirable man and &s;agacious pe|netrating philo&s;opher, Dr. FRANKLIN, has left us, among innumerable in&s;tructions for the conduct of human life, and for remedying many of the griev|ances of it, directions for going a voyage at &s;ea, and has particularly enforced the folly of quitting &s;hips ha&s;tily, and yielding one's &s;elf up to de&s;pair. I am convinced, that nine tenths of the people who peri&s;h by &s;hipwreck, peri&s;h from the want of pre|&s;ence of mind, and &s;ufficient fortitude to bear them out. The unhappy pur&s;er, who &s;at deliberately in a chair, and &s;uffered him&s;elf, without a &s;truggle, to be carried overboard, is an in&s;tance in point. The feeble conduct of the captain and crew is another. Had he, in&s;tead of tearing of his hair, raving, and acting the part of a bedlamite, encouraged his men, and taken vigorous mea&s;ures in time; and had they, in&s;tead of whimpering prayers on their knees, and whipping their images, made all clear, and prepared for the wor&s;t; in &s;hort, had they, according to the moral of the old fable, put their &s;houlder to the wheel, in&s;tead of calling on Hercules, it is not im|po&s;&s;ible but the ve&s;&s;el might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>As for my part, the joy of e&s;caping immediate death made me blind to the other mi&s;eries of my &s;ituation. Naked, moneyle&s;s and friendle&s;s, upon an unknown, and probably inho&s;pitable coa&s;t, what rea&s;onable cau&s;e had I to rejoice? Perhaps the re|ver&s;e. But that remains to be &s;een.</P>
<P>How long I continued in the &s;woon into which I had fallen, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell; but, when I recovered, I found my&s;elf &s;urrounded by
<PB N="289" REF="033487_0288_0FF7250438459BF0">
a guard of armed &s;oldiers, &s;epoys, and pikemen. I knew them immediately to be the troops of HY|DER ALLI, and almo&s;t wi&s;hed my&s;elf back into the waves again. Looking round, I &s;aw that the people and effects that had been &s;aved from the wreck were collected all together along with me.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate we remained till it was dark. A La&s;car<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natives of India, employed &s;ometimes as &s;ailors, &s;ome|times for inferior offices in the army, &s;uch as pitching tents, drawing guns, &amp;c.</NOTE> belonging to the ve&s;&s;el, perceiving that my nakedne&s;s gave me great concern, tore into two a piece of cloth which he had tied round his wai&s;t, and gave me one part of it, which afforded a &s;hort apron. This &s;imple act of a poor, uninformed black man, whom chri&s;tian charity would call an idolator, methought had more of the true and e&s;|&s;ential &s;pirit of charity in it, than half the o&s;tenta|tious, parading new&s;paper public charities of Lon|don&mdash;the &s;lough of pur&s;e-proud vanity, and un|wieldy bloathed wealth. Of all the acts of beneficence that I ever met with, it &s;truck me the mo&s;t forcibly: it had kindne&s;s, di&s;-intere&s;tedne&s;s and delicacy for its ba&s;is; and I have never &s;ince thought of it without wi&s;hing that I could meet the man, to reward him for his beneficence with a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for life. The lower order of people of a certain country, I know, would think a man in &s;uch circum&s;tances as I was then in, a fitter ob|ject of plea&s;antry than pity.</P>
<P>The va&s;t quantity of &s;alt water I had &s;wallowed, &s;till made me deadly &s;ick in the &s;tomach: how|ever, after &s;ome time, I threw it up, and got great relief. I had hardly felt the comfortable effects of this, before I was ordered to march: nine of us, all La&s;cars except my&s;elf, were conveyed to a vil|lage at a few miles di&s;tance on the &s;ea-&s;ide, where we were for the night put into a &s;quare place, walled round, open to the inclemency of the wea|ther
<PB N="290" REF="033487_0289_0FF72505C8997638">
above and below, and filled with large logs of wood; it blew mo&s;t violently, and the rain fell in torrents&mdash;while not one &s;mooth plank could be found on which to &s;tretch our fatigued and wa&s;ted bodies. Thus, naked, &s;ick, exhau&s;ted with fatigue and fa&s;ting, drenched with wet, and unable to lie down, our mi&s;ery might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be incapa|ble of increa&s;e. But, alas! where are the bounds which we can &s;et to human woe?&mdash;Thir&s;t, that mo&s;t dreadful of pains, occa&s;ioned by the drench|ing with &s;alt water, &s;eized us: we begged, we entreated, we clamoured for water; but the inhu|man wretches, deaf to the groans and &s;creeches of their fellow-creatures, (for &s;ome grew delirious with the agony of thir&s;t), refu&s;ed them even the cheap and mi&s;erable indulgence of a drop of water!</P>
<P>The influence of the mind upon the body has been much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers and phy|&s;icians, and I believe will be admitted by all wi&s;e men. I was my&s;elf in this in&s;tance, a &s;triking proof of it; for, though I had &s;wallowed and thrown up &s;o much &s;alt water, though my thir&s;t had exceeded any thing I had ever before felt&mdash;yet, finding that water was not to be had or expected, I compo&s;ed my mind to do without it, diverted my thoughts from it by the contemplation of the many other evils which be&s;et me, and pa&s;&s;ed the night without that horrible agony experienced by the others.</P>
<P>Indeed, a night of more exqui&s;ite horror cannot be imagined. The thoughts of being a pri&s;oner to HYDER ALLI, was, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to render me completely unhappy: but my utter want of clothes almo&s;t put me be&s;ide my&s;elf; and lying expo&s;ed to the open air, where I was glad to &s;it clo&s;e to the La&s;cars to receive a little heat from their bodies, and to hold open my mouth in order to catch a drop of the de&s;cending rain, was a &s;tate
<PB N="291" REF="033487_0290_0FF7250755090E38">
that might be con&s;idered as the highe&s;t refinement upon mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the morning, a little cold rice was brought us to eat, and water was dug out of a hole near the &s;pot for us; but as all things in this life are good or bad merely relatively, this wretched fare was &s;ome refre&s;hment to us. I was then removed to the ruins of a toddy-hut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall temporary hut, where <HI>toddy</HI> (a liquor extracted from the cocoa-nut tree) is &s;old.</NOTE> &s;epara|ted from the re&s;t, and a guard &s;et over me. Here I had full room for reflection, and could "medi|tate e'en to madne&s;s." The whole of my &s;ituation appeared before me with all its aggravating circum|&s;tances of horror; and to any one who con&s;iders it, I believe it will appear that it was hardly po&s;&s;i|ble to fill the bitter cup of calamity fuller. Oh! what were my thoughts! My family bereft of him on who&s;e efforts they were in a great mea&s;ure to de+pend for &s;upport and protection&mdash;you, then a little innocent cherub, appeared to my di&s;tracted imagi|nation twining round your mother's neck, and, in infant clamour, calling your father&mdash;while he, in a dreadful captivity, compared with which even a cruel death were mercy, lay wa&s;ting, naked and forlorn, peri&s;hing with the inclemency of the wea|ther, wanting even food fit for his &s;upport, and expo&s;ed to the &s;courge of every petty tyrant that barbarous power might employ to guard him!&mdash; Such were my reflections: they were in rea&s;on well founded; for there was no probability of my being ever relea&s;ed, as my captivity was unlikely to be known to my country, or by my friends.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate I was, when, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and to my no le&s;s joy, the amiable companion of my &s;hipwreck, Mr. HALL, appeared before me. I &s;carcely knew how to think his appearance reali|ty, as I under&s;tood that the La&s;cars then along with
<PB N="292" REF="033487_0291_0FF7250AD5EC4A18">
me were all that were &s;aved from the wreck; and he was, at the time I parted from him, &s;o exhau&s;t|ed both in body and mind, that I thought he would be the la&s;t who could e&s;cape. He, however, &s;hook me by the hand; and, fitting down, told me that he had given me up for lo&s;t, and remained with the ve&s;&s;el until the tide, having ebbed, left her almo&s;t dry&mdash;that, immediately on getting a&s;hore, and be|ing taken pri&s;oner, he made inquiries about me, and heard that I had been &s;aved&mdash;that, finding this, his joy was &s;uch as to make him almo&s;t forget his own misfortunes&mdash;and, exerting all his entrea|ties not to be &s;eparated from me, they had been &s;o far indulgent to him, and had brought him to me, that we might be companions in bondage. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded, that out of eleven Europeans and fifty-&s;ix La&s;cars who were on board, only he and I of the former, and fourteen of the latter, were &s;aved from the wreck, the re&s;t having been drowned in the attempt, excepting &s;ome who, overcome with ter|ror, angui&s;h and anxiety, and exhau&s;ted with fa|tigue, had bid a formal adieu to their companions, let go their hold, and calmly and voluntarily given them&s;elves up to the deep.</P>
<P>I here took occa&s;ion to remark to him, what I have already &s;aid to you, that thou&s;ands lo&s;e their lives for want of per&s;everance, fortitude, and cou|rage to pre&s;erve them&mdash;Had the Engli&s;h Pur&s;er collected courage enough to hold fa&s;t till the tide ebbed, he might have been &s;afe on &s;hore as we were, as he was &s;uperior to either of us in bodily &s;trength.</P>
<P>"Ah! my friend!" &s;aid he, &s;haking his head de&s;pondingly&mdash;"is he wor&s;e where he is? I doubt whether death is not far preferable to our pre&s;ent pro&s;pects."</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid I, perceiving he was me|lancholy, though I my&s;elf laboured under all the horrors he expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;"come, let us not think; all
<PB N="293" REF="033487_0292_0FF7250EF9F5D460">
will yet be well: I fore&s;ee it will; and you mu&s;t known I have &s;omething of the prophet in my nature&mdash;perhaps the &s;econd &s;ight." I then told him my pre&s;entiments on leaving Goa, which much a&s;toni&s;hed him&mdash;&s;till more when I acquaint|ed him with the formal acts I had done in con&s;e|quence thereof, by Mr. HENSHAW'S advice, and with his privity.</P>
<P>In fact, our joy at meeting was reciprocally great, and in &s;ome re&s;pect cheered us for the time under all our mi&s;eries in hand, and the dreary pro&s;pect of tho&s;e yet to come.</P>
<P>Perceiving that he &s;tood as much in need of re|lief as I did when the La&s;car relieved me by divid|ing his cloth, I took mine off, tore it in two, and gave him half of it: you may well conceive our mi&s;ery from this, if other circum&s;tances were want|ing, that &s;uch a thing as a rag of linen, not worth &s;ix pence, was a very material accommodation to us both.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter, occa&s;ioned by the account of my &s;hipwreck and &s;ub&s;equent di&s;a&s;ter, gave me, my amiable boy! as great plea&s;ure as tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters gave me pain. Your account, too, of JOHN'S bur&s;ting into tears on the reading of it to him, had almo&s;t a &s;imilar effect upon my&s;elf: and I tru&s;t in the Almighty di&s;po&s;er of events, that that excel|lent turn of mind will be &s;o fa&s;hioned by the edu|cation I give you, as to make it the &s;ource of boundle&s;s gratification and true greatne&s;s (by which I mean goodne&s;s) here, and of never-fading feli|city hereafter. You &s;ay you cannot account for it,
<PB N="294" REF="033487_0293_0FF725108BA2AB10">
but you found more happine&s;s at my e&s;cape, than mi&s;ery at my misfortunes. I hail that circum&s;tance as the &s;tronge&s;t mark of perfect excellence of di&s;|po&s;ition. A great moral philo&s;opher has laid it down as a maxim, that it is the &s;urer mark of a good heart to &s;ympathi&s;e with joy than with &s;or|row; and this in&s;tance only comes in aid of that opinion of you which my fond hopes have always nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t declare to you, that my plea&s;ure at e&s;caping &s;hipwreck was by no means as great as the agony my mind underwent as the pro&s;|pect now before me was poignant. I have already &s;aid, and indeed with truth, that I &s;hould have with much greater plea&s;ure embraced death: I, who had been already &s;ome years in India, and had op|portunities of hearing, as well from my father as from other officers in the &s;ervice, what the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the tyrant in who&s;e power I had now fallen was, knew too well the horrors of my &s;ituation to feel any thing like hope. The unmerciful di&s;po&s;i|tion of HYDER, and all tho&s;e in authority under him, and the cruel policy of the Ea&s;tern chiefs, making the life of any one, particularly a Briti&s;h pri&s;oner, at the be&s;t a precarious tenure, I did not know the moment when death might be infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted upon me with perhaps a thou&s;and aggravating cir|cum&s;tances: and at all events, the affairs which demanded my pre&s;ence in India &s;o very importu|nately as to urge me to all the fatigues and hard|&s;hips of a pa&s;&s;age over land, were, of them&s;elves, &s;ufficient to make my mind unea&s;y; but the abject &s;tate of want and nakedne&s;s in which it &s;eemed I was likely to remain, &s;truck a deep and damp hor|ror to my heart, and almo&s;t unman'd me.</P>
<P>Mr. HALL and I, however, endeavoured with all our might to &s;tem the headlong torrent of our fate&mdash;Melancholy preyed deeply and openly upon him, while I concealed mine, and endeavoured to
<PB N="295" REF="033487_0294_0FF725121B296E20">
cheer the &s;inking &s;pirits of that noble youth, who, I perceived was the prey rather of extreme &s;en&s;i|bility than feeblene&s;s of mind. All the horrors of &s;hivering nakedne&s;s, though, to a mind delicate like his, and a per&s;on reared in the lap of luxury, &s;ufficiently goading, appeared as nothing when com|pared with one lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained in the depre|dations with which &s;hipwreck is con&s;tantly fol|lowed up. In the cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e between life and death, which I have already de&s;cribed, previous to my getting on &s;hore, this amiable young man had &s;ecured and trea&s;ured next his heart, as the in&s;epe|rable companion of his fate, a miniature portrait of a young lady; it hung round his neck, and was, by the unfeeling villains who &s;eized him on his land|ing, taken away. This cruel deprivation was an ince&s;&s;ant corro&s;ive to his mind&mdash;the copious &s;ource of angui&s;h to his heart&mdash;the hourly theme of the mo&s;t pathetic, affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting exclamations. "Had I," he would cry, "oh! had I had but the good for|tune to have gone to the bottom while yet it hung about my neck, I &s;hould have been happy: but now, &s;eparated from the heavenly original, and bereft of the precious image, what is life? what would be life were I yet &s;ure of it? What plea|&s;ure, what common content, has the world left for me? None&mdash;oh! none, none! Never &s;hall this heart again know comfort!</P>

<P>At the end of that time, we, and, along with us, the La&s;cars, were ordered to proceed into the country, and drove on foot to a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, in order to render up an account of our&s;elves to per&s;ons belonging to government, authori&s;ed to take it. It was advanced in the morning when we moved, without receiving any &s;ort of &s;u&s;tenance; and were marched in that wa&s;ting climate eight hours, without breaking our fa&s;t; during which time we were expo&s;ed alternately to the &s;corching heat of the &s;un and heavy torrents of rain, which rai&s;ed painful bli&s;ters on our &s;kin: we had often to &s;tand expo&s;ed to the weather, or to lie down, under the pre&s;&s;ure of fatigue and weakne&s;s, on the bare ground; then wait an hour, or more, at the door of &s;ome in&s;olent, unfeeling mon&s;ter, until he fini&s;hed his dinner, or took his afternoon's nap; and when this was over, drove forward with wan|ton barbarity by the people who attended us.</P>
<P>You, my FREDERICK! who only know the mild and merciful di&s;po&s;ition of the people of Great Britain, where government, religion, and long habit, have reduced charity and benevolence &s;o completely to a &s;y&s;tem that they &s;eem to be in|nate principles of the mind, can have no concep|tion of a people who will not only look upon the wor&s;t human afflictions with indifference, but take a &s;avage delight in the mi&s;eries of their fellow-creatures, even where no po&s;&s;ible advantage can be reaped from their inhumanity, and where the only reward they can propo&s;e to them&s;elves for their cruelty is the plea&s;ure of contemplating human &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="033487_0296_0FF72518DEE25770">Such, &s;orry am I to &s;ay it, is the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t Indies that I have been in; and although tho&s;e parts under the dominion of Great Britain owe their emancipation from the mo&s;t galling yokes to the Engli&s;h&mdash;and though, under their au&s;pices, they live in a &s;tate of greater happine&s;s than ever they did, and greater freedom even than Britons them&s;elves&mdash;yet &s;uch is the wicked ingratitude of many of them, &s;uch the inflexible animo&s;ity ari&s;ing from a contra|dictory religion, that the death or &s;uffering of an Engli&s;hman, or any misfortune that may befal him, often &s;erves only as matter of &s;port or amu&s;ement to them.

<P>Two days after this, we were moved again, and marched up the country by a long and circuitious route, in which we underwent every hard&s;hip that cruelty could inflict, or human fortitude endure&mdash; now bli&s;tered with the heat, now drenched with the rain, and now chilled with the night damps &mdash;de&s;titute of any place but the bare earth to re&s;t or lay our heads on, with only a &s;canty pittance of boil|ed rice for our &s;upport&mdash;often without water to quench our thir&s;t, and con&s;tantly goaded by the guards, who pricked us with their bayonets every now and then, at once to evince their power, en|tertain the &s;pectators, and mortify us. We arrived at Hydernagur, the metropolis of the province of Biddanore&mdash;a fort of con&s;idereble &s;trength, mounting upwards of &s;eventy guns, containing a large garri&s;on of men, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="033487_0297_0FF7251F15655B20">It was about two o'clock in the morning when we arrived at Biddanore: the day was extremely hot, and we were kept out under the full heat of that broiling &s;un till &s;ix o'clock in the evening, be|fore we were admitted to an audience of the Je|madar, or governor of the place, without having a mouthful of victuals offered to us after the fati|guing march of the morning.</P>
<P>While we &s;tood in this forlorn &s;tate, a va&s;t con|cour&s;e of people collected about, and viewed us with curio&s;ity. Looking round through tho&s;e who &s;tood neare&s;t, I ob&s;erved &s;ome men gazing at me with &s;trong marks of emotion, and a mixture of wonder and concern pourtrayed in their countenances. Surpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch &s;ymptoms of humanity in a My&s;orian Indian, I looked at them with more &s;cruti|inicing attention, and thought that their faces were familiar to me. Catching my eye, they looked at me &s;ignificantly, as though they would expre&s;s their regard and re&s;pect for me, if they dared; and I then began to recollect that they were formerly privates in my regiment of cavalry, and were then pri&s;oners at large with HYDER.</P>
<P>I was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed that tho&s;e poor fellows &s;hould recogni&s;e me in my pre&s;ent mi&s;erable fallen &s;tate, than affected at the &s;ympathetic feeling they di&s;clo&s;ed. I returned their look with a private nod of recognition; but, &s;eeing that they were afraid to &s;peak to me, and fearing I might injure them by di&s;clo&s;ing our acquaintance, I forbore any thing more. The guilty &s;ouls of de&s;potic governments are perpetually alive to &s;u&s;picion: every look alarms them; and alarm or &s;u&s;picion never fails to be fol|lowed up with pro&s;cription or death.</P>
<P>Men, when in the fullne&s;s of power and pride of office, very &s;eldom give them&s;elves time to reflect upon the in&s;tability of human greatne&s;s, and the uncertainty of earthly contingencies. When, in|ve&s;ted with alll the trappings of authority, I com|manded

<P>HAD we been made pri&s;oners of war in battle again&s;t an enemy, there is no law of nature or nations, no rule of rea&s;on or principle of equity, that could palliate &s;uch treatment as that which we now received: but, ca&s;t by misfortune and &s;hip-wreck on their &s;hore, we were entitled to &s;olace and protection.

<P>Mortifications of one &s;ort or other&mdash;the ince&s;&s;ant torturing of the mind on the rack of &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;the injuries to the animal &s;y&s;tem, occa&s;ioned by con|&s;tant expo&s;ure to the weather, and the want of food &mdash;all con&s;pired to reduce me to the dimen&s;ions and feeblene&s;s of a &s;keleton. I had grown daily weaker and weaker, and was now nearly exhau&s;ted, and quite faint; while, on the other hand, my amiable companion in affliction was reduced by a dy&s;entery, which attacked him &s;oon after our &s;hipwreck, and which the torments of his mind, the want of medi|cine and comfortable food, and, above all, the alter|nate violent changes from profu&s;e per&s;piration in walking to chilling cold at night, had increa&s;ed to &s;uch an alarming degree, that he was obliged to be carried the two la&s;t days journey:&mdash;In this &s;tate, we appeared to each other as two &s;pectres hanging over the brink of the grave: and in truth, perceiv|ing the rapid progre&s;s he was making to his di&s;&s;olu|tion, I was affected to a degree, that, while it really exa&s;perated my own worn-down &s;tate, deprived me of all attention to the rapid decline I was fall|ing into, and almo&s;t entirely engro&s;&s;ed my care. In my progre&s;s through life, I have had occa&s;ion to try &s;everal men, and have found among them many who were every thing that a good heart could wi&s;h to find: but this young gentleman had at once &s;o much &s;uavity and &s;pirit&mdash;&s;uch gentlene&s;s and forti|titude&mdash;his &s;ufferings (tho&s;e of his mind, as well as tho&s;e of his body) were &s;o exqui&s;ite, and he bore them with &s;uch meekne&s;s, tempered by &s;uch unin|terrupted good humour, and concealed and managed with &s;o much delicacy, that I do not tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of truth when I &s;ay I never met one who &s;o entirely intere&s;ted my feelings, and attached my

friend&s;hip &s;o unalterably, upon principles of in|&s;tinctive impul&s;e, as well as rea&s;on. Impelled by the irre&s;i&s;tible claims he had upon my approbation and e&s;teem, I entered with all the warmth of a brother into his &s;ufferings, and can a&s;&s;ert with truth that they con&s;tituted the &s;evere&s;t trials I underwent during my whole impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>While we &s;tood in the court, waiting to be brought before the Jemadar, we pre&s;ented a &s;pecta|cle that would have wrung pity, one would think, from the heart of a tiger, if a tiger was endued with reflection. At length we were &s;ummoned to appear before him, and brought into his pre&s;ence. I had made up my mind for the occa&s;ion&mdash;deter|mined to deport my&s;elf in a manly, candid man|ner&mdash;and to let no con&s;ideration what&s;oever lead me to any thing di&s;graceful to my real character, or unworthy my &s;ituation in life; and, finally, had prepared my&s;elf to meet, without &s;hrinking, what|ever misfortunes might yet be in &s;tore for me, or whatever cruelties the barbarous di&s;po&s;ition or wicked policy of the Tyrant might think proper to inflict.</P>
<P>On entering, we found the Jemadar in full Dur|bar.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Court.</NOTE> He was then occupied with the reading of di&s;patches, and in tran&s;acting other public bu&s;ine&s;s. We were placed directly oppo&s;ite to him, where we &s;tood for near an hour, during which time he never ca&s;t his eyes towards us: but when at la&s;t he had concluded the bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he was en|gaged, and deigned to look at us, we were ordered to pro&s;trate our&s;elves before him: the La&s;cars im|mediately obeyed the order, and threw them&s;elves on the ground; but I contented my&s;elf with mak|ing a &s;alam, in which poor Mr. HALL, who knew not the Ea&s;tern manner as I did, followed my example.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="033487_0301_0FF72529D78FCCA0">As &s;oon as this ceremony was over, the Jemadar (who was no other man than the famous HYAT SAHIB that has made &s;ome noi&s;e in the hi&s;tory of that war) began to que&s;tion me. He de&s;ired to know, who I was?&mdash;what my profe&s;&s;ion was?&mdash; what was the cau&s;e and manner of my approaching the country of HYDER ALLI?&mdash;To all tho&s;e que&s;|tions I gave an&s;wers that &s;eemed to &s;atisfy him. He then a&s;ked me, what news I had brought with me from Europe?&mdash;inquired into the &s;tate of the army, and number of recruits di&s;patched in the &s;hips of that &s;ea&s;on&mdash;was minute and circum&s;tantial in his que&s;tions re&s;pecting the nature and &s;ucce&s;s of the war in Europe&mdash;and examined me clo&s;ely, touching the re&s;ources of the Ea&s;t India Company. I &s;aw his drift, and was cautious and circum&s;pect in my an&s;wers, and at the &s;ame time contrived to &s;peak with an air of candour that in &s;ome &s;ort &s;atis|fied him.</P>
<P>Having exhau&s;ted his whole &s;tring of que&s;tions, he turned the di&s;cour&s;e to another &s;ubject&mdash;no le&s;s than his great and pui&s;&s;ant Lord and Ma&s;ter, HY|DER, of whom he had endeavoured to impre&s;s me with a great, if not terrible idea&mdash;amplifying his power, his wealth, and the extent and opulence of his dominions&mdash;and de&s;cribing to me, in the mo&s;t exaggerated terms, the number of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his military talents&mdash;his va&s;t, and, accor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to his account, unrivalled genius&mdash;his amazing abilities in conquering and governing Nations&mdash;and, above all, his many amiable qualities, and &s;plendid en|dowments of heart, no le&s;s than under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Having thus, with equal zeal and fidelity, en|deavoured to impre&s;s me with veneration for his Lord and Ma&s;ter, and for that purpo&s;e attributed to him every perfection that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided among all the Kings and Generals that have lived &s;ince the birth of CHRIST, and given each their due, he turned to the Engli&s;h Government,
<PB N="303" REF="033487_0302_0FF7252BB6F7D2B8">
and endeavoured to demon&s;trate to me the folly and inutility of our attempting to re&s;i&s;t his progre&s;s, which he compared to that of the &s;ea, to a tempe&s;t, to a torrent, to a lion's pace and fury&mdash;to every thing that an Ea&s;tern imagination could &s;ugge&s;t as a figure proper to exemplify grandeur and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble power. He then vaunted of his Sovereign's &s;ucce&s;&s;es over the Engli&s;h, &s;ome of which I had not heard of before, and did not believe; and con|cluded by a&s;&s;uring me, that it was HYDER'S deter|mination to drive all Europeans from Indo&s;tan, which he averred he could not fail to do, con&s;ider|ing the weakne&s;s of the one, and boundle&s;s power of the other. This part of HYAT SAHIB'S di&s;|cour&s;e is well worth your remembering, as it will &s;erve to make a very diverting contra&s;t with his &s;ub&s;equent conduct.</P>
<P>After having expended near half an hour in this manner, he called upon me to come over near him, and cau&s;ed me to &s;eat my&s;elf upon a mat with a pillow to lean upon&mdash;encouraged me, by every means he could, by the mo&s;t gentle accents, and the mo&s;t &s;oothing, mollifying language, to &s;peak to him without the lea&s;t re&s;erve&mdash;exhorted me to tell him the truth in every thing we &s;poke of&mdash;and hinted to me, that my falling into his hands might turn out the mo&s;t fortunate event of my life.</P>
<P>I was at a lo&s;s to what motive to attribute all tho&s;e &s;ingular marks of indulgence; but found that he had learned who&s;e &s;on I was, and knew my father by reputation from the pri&s;oners, our Sepoys, who were now pri&s;oners at large here: and as rank and office are the chief recommendation in the Ea&s;t, as well as el&s;ewhere, or rather much more than any where el&s;e, the &s;agacious HYAT SAHIB found many claims to e&s;teem and humanity in me as the &s;on of a Colonel CAMPBELL, which he never would have found in me had I been the &s;on of a plain humble farmer or trade&s;man in England.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="033487_0303_0FF72530F61E1488">After a full hour's audience, in which HYAT SAHIB treated me with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of his favour, con&s;idering my &s;ituation, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with the ceremony of beetle-nut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An aromatic nut which the Ea&s;t Indians chew; it is warm and a&s;tringent, and con&s;idered by them a great re&s;torative.</NOTE> ro&s;e-water, and other compliments, which are in that country held as the &s;tronge&s;t marks of politene&s;s, re&s;pect, and good-will.</P>
<P>Leaving the Durbar, I was led to the inner fort or citadel: and the officious zeal of tho&s;e about me, unwilling to let me remain ignorant of that which they conceived to be a mo&s;t fortunate turn in my affairs, gave the <HI>coup de grace</HI> to my mi&s;eries as I went along, by congratulating me on the favourable opinion which the Jemadar had formed of me, and intimating at the &s;ame time that I would &s;oon be honoured with a re&s;pectible command in HYDER'S &s;ervice.</P>
<P>If I was mi&s;erable before, this intimation entire|ly de&s;troyed the la&s;t remnant of peace or hope.

<P>That night the Jemadar &s;ent me an excellent &s;up|per, of not le&s;s than &s;ix di&s;hes, from his own table; and although I had been &s;o long fami&s;hing with the want of whole&s;ome food, the idea of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the &s;ervice of HYDER &s;truck me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, that I lo&s;t all appetite, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to eat a mouthful.

were &s;eperated from the La&s;cars, Who were relea&s;ed and forced to work.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the favourable intentions mani|fe&s;ted towards me by the Jemader, as I have alrea|dy mentioned, no mark of it what&s;oever appeared in our lodging. This con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall place, exactly the &s;ize of our length and breadth, in the zig-zag of one of the gates of the citadel: it was open in front, but covered with a kind of a &s;hed on the top; and a number of other pri&s;oners were about us: each of us was allowed a mat and pillow, and this formed the whole of our local accommoda|tions. Upon my remarking it, we were told, that in conformity to the cu&s;tom of the Circar,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Country or Province.</NOTE> we mu&s;t be treated &s;o for &s;ome time, but that our ac|commodations would afterwards be extended, and made more agreeable to our wi&s;hes: even this was better than our &s;ituation &s;ince we landed.</P>
<P>In addition to this luxury, we were allowed to the value of four pence halfpenny a day for our maintenance; and a guard of Sepoys was put over us and a few more pri&s;oners, one of whom was di|rected to go and purcha&s;e our victuals, and do &s;uch offices for us.</P>
<P>This guard was changed every week&mdash;a &s;trong mark of the &s;u&s;picious and wary tempers of tho&s;e people, who could fear intrigues and cabals between wretched pri&s;oners like us and their &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>In two or three days after this, HYAT SAHIB &s;ent for me, treated me with great kindne&s;s, gave me &s;ome tea, and furni&s;hed me with two or three &s;hirts, an old coat, and two pairs of breeches, which were &s;tripped from the dead bodies that were thrown a&s;hore from the wreck&mdash;every thing that was &s;aved from it being &s;ent to Biddanore.

thirty rupees&mdash;and, upon my going away, told me that in a few days a very flattering propo&s;al would be made to me, and that my &s;ituation would be ren|dered not only comfortable, but enviable.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s to you, my dear FREDERICK! the horror I felt at the idea of this intended propo&s;al&mdash;for I knew but too well what it meant. It was the &s;ource of bitter mi&s;ery to my mind: neverthele&s;s, I determined to re&s;i&s;t every effort that &s;hould be made, whether blandi&s;hment, intreaty, or menace&mdash;to lay down my life it&s;elf, though in ob&s;curity, with honour&mdash;and to carry along with me, go where I would, the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having done my duty.</P>
<P>I have in the cour&s;e of my life met with many people, who, under the plau&s;ible pretext of libe|rality and greatne&s;s of mind, have called them&s;elves citizens of the world, and declared that the coun|try where they lived, be that what country it might, was their's, and demanded their allegiance and pro|tection: but I have always &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that &s;uch men act from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being outca&s;ts of their own country&mdash;and, &s;corned and rejected by their fellow-citizens, would retaliate by affecting to deny their natural attachment. There are men who neitheir love father, mother, &s;i&s;ter, brother, or connection: &s;uch, however, are, thank GOD! very thinly &s;own in this world; but, except it be a few &s;uch unnatural people, I am convinced that there is no one who&s;e heart does not confe&s;s the patriotic pa&s;&s;ion, and burn with a flame, more or le&s;s ardent, of love for his country.

<P>ON the evening of that day on which the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB had honoured me with an audience, given me clothes and money, and informed me that a propo&s;al, which he called flat|tering, would be made to me, I was &s;ent for to attend, not at the Durbar, but at the hou&s;e of a man high in office. As I expected to meet HYAT SAHIB him&s;elf, and trembled at the thoughts of his expected propo&s;ition, I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and in|deed plea&s;ed, to find that it was with one of his people only I was to have a conference. This man, who&s;e name I now forget, received me with great kindne&s;s, encouraged me, made me &s;it down with him, and began to &s;peak of HYAT SAHIB, whom he extolled to the &s;kies, as a per&s;on endowed with every great and amiable quality; informing me at the &s;ame time, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the friend|&s;hip and confidence of his ma&s;ter, HYDER ALLI, in a greater degree than any other per&s;on&mdash;TIPPOO SAHIB, his own &s;on, not excepted: he then gave me the private hi&s;tory of HYAT&mdash;&s;aying, that he was born a Gentoo prince, of one of the provin|ces of the Malabar coa&s;t, which had fallen beneath the irre&s;i&s;tible arms of HYDER, and had been by him annexed to the va&s;t My&s;orean Empire. HY|AT, he &s;aid, was then only a boy of eleven or twelve years of age, of a mo&s;t promi&s;ing genius, and a quickne&s;s of mind unu&s;ually met with in
<PB N="308" REF="033487_0307_0FF7253A9995AAD8">
one of tho&s;e tender years. HYDER, who was in all re&s;pects a man of unrivalled penetration, thought he &s;aw in the boy that which, if properly culti|vated, would turn out of va&s;t u&s;e to a &s;tate; and as, in all Mahomedan governments, unconnected, i&s;olated boys, oft-times &s;laves, are bred up in the &s;eraglio to &s;ucceed to the great offices of the &s;tate, HYDER adopted the boy, had him made a Mahome|dan, and, in fact, treated him as if he had been the i&s;&s;ue of his own loins, and brought him up with all the affection and tenderne&s;s of a fond parent. I am the more particular in &s;tating this part of HYAT'S hi&s;tory to you, as &s;ome re&s;pectable hi&s;torians, de|ceived by erroneous report, have &s;aid that he was the illegitimate offspring of HYDER. The &s;ultan, however, was not di&s;appointed in the expectations he had formed; for HYAT SAHIB had, in zeal, fi|delity and attachment, as well as in intellectual facul|ties and talents for governing, even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t hopes of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having given me this conci&s;e account of the Jemadar, he proceeded to inform me, that the Arcot Sepoys, whom I have before mentioned to you, had di&s;covered to HYAT SAHIB who I was, given him a full account of my family, and inform|ed him that I had commanded a regiment of cavalry in the &s;ervice of the Nabob of Arcot, together with a corps of infantry and artillery attached to it. In con&s;equence of this report, HYAT SAHIB, he &s;aid, had intere&s;ted him&s;elf very warmly in my favour, and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe&s;&s;ed an anxious de&s;ire to render me a &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Thus far the di&s;cour&s;e plea&s;ed me. Nothing was &s;aid in it to give me alarm; on the contrary. I in|dulged a hope, that, knowing my rank, and the rank of my father, he would no longer entertain a hope of my entering into the &s;ervice of HYDER, and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the time I was to be impri&s;oned, treat me with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ble indulgence. But I flattered my&s;elf too &s;oon; or, as the old &s;aying is, "reckoned with|out my ho&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="033487_0308_0FF7253D6D82F0A0">When he had fini&s;hed his hi&s;tory of HYAT SA|HIB, which he overcharged with ful&s;ome panegyric, he told me, with a face full of that triumphant im|portance which one who thinks he is conferring a great favour generally a&s;&s;umes, that it was the inten|tion of HYAT SAHIB, for and on behalf of his ma&s;|ter the Sultan, to give me the command of five thou&s;and men&mdash;an offer which he &s;uppo&s;ed I could not think of declining, and therefore expected no other an&s;wer but a profu&s;ion of thanks, and &s;trong manife&s;tations of joy on my part.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe to you my di&s;may at this formal propo&s;al, or pourtray to you the various emotions that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t. Re&s;entment had its &s;hare&mdash;the pride of the &s;oldier, not unaccompanied with the pride of fami|ly and rank, while it urged me to &s;purn from me &s;uch a ba&s;e accommodation, made me con&s;ider the offer as a great in&s;ult. I therefore pau&s;ed a little, to &s;uppre&s;s my feelings; and then told him my firm re&s;olution, never to accept of &s;uch a propo&s;al; and upon his expre&s;&s;ing great a&s;toni&s;hment of my de|clining a &s;tation &s;o fraught with advantage, I laid down, in the be&s;t manner I could, my rea&s;ons; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that he li&s;tened to all the objections I &s;tarted with great patience; but, in the conclu|&s;ion, &s;aid he had little doubt of finding means to overcome my reluctance.</P>
<P>He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me for the pre&s;ent, and I returned to my pri&s;on, where I related to my companion, Mr. HALL, every thing that pa&s;&s;ed between us: we canva&s;&s;ed the matter fully, and he agreed with me, that it was likely to turn out a mo&s;t dreadful and cruel per&s;ecution. It was on this occa&s;ion that I fir&s;t felt the truth of the principle, that per&s;ecu|tion never fails to be &s;ubver&s;ive of its own end, and to promote that which it is intended to de&s;troy. There is, in the human mind, an innite abhorrence of compul&s;ion; and per&s;ecution always gives new

<P>Piqued by the idea of per&s;ecution, I began to feel a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m which I was before a &s;tranger to: I looked forward, with a kind of gloomy plea&s;ure, to the mi&s;eries that brutal tyranny might inflict upon me, even to death it&s;elf; and already began to indulge the exultation of martyr|dom "No," &s;aid I, "my dear HALL! never will I tarni&s;h the character of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier&mdash;never will I di&s;grace my blood or my profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;never &s;hall an act of mine fully the pure fame of my re|vered father&mdash;never &s;hall any &s;ufferings of mine, however poignant, or worldly advantage, however &s;eductive, tempt me to do that which his noble &s;pirit would regard with horror or contempt. I may, and I fore&s;ee I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable; but I never will be ba&s;e or degenerate!" Indeed, I had wrought my&s;elf up to &s;uch a pitch of firmne&s;s, that I am per&s;uaded the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and refined cruelties which the ingenuity of an Iroquois Indian could have inflicted on my body, would have been utterly incapable of bending the &s;tubborn temper of my mind.</P>
<P>The place in which we were lodged was &s;ituated in a way not very favourable to our feelings. Ju&s;t within &s;ight of it, the commandant of the citadel held a court&mdash;by him yclep'd a court of ju&s;tice&mdash; where the mo&s;t &s;hocking, barbarious cruelties were hourly exerci&s;ed&mdash;mo&s;t of them for the purpo&s;e of extorting money, and compelling the di&s;covery of hidden, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ppo&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious hidden trea&s;ures. Indeed, five &s;ixths of tho&s;e who &s;uffered were of this de&s;|cription; and the proce&s;s per&s;ued was as artful as barbarious: they fir&s;t began with care&s;&s;es, then proceeded to examination and cro&s;&s;-examination, thence to threats, thence to puni&s;hment, and final|ly, to the mo&s;t cruel tortures.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="033487_0310_0FF7254283B0B3C0">Directly oppo&s;ite to us, was impri&s;oned an un|fortunate per&s;on, who had for years been a clo&s;e captive, and the &s;port and &s;ubject of tho&s;e enormi|ties.

<P>Mr. HALL, notwith&s;tanding the various &s;ufferings both of mind and body which he had undergone, began to recruit, and get a little better; and this circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, diffu&s;ed a flow of &s;pirits over me that contributed to my &s;upport. We con|&s;oled each other by every means we could devi&s;e&mdash; &s;ometimes indulging in all the luxury of woe&mdash; &s;ometimes rallying each other, and, with ill-di&s;&s;em|bled &s;prightline&s;s, calling on the godde&s;s EUPHRO|SYNE to come with her <HI>"quirps and cranks, and wreathed &s;miles:"</HI> but, alas! the mountain nymph, &s;weet LIBERTY, was far away, and the godde&s;s &s;hunned our abode. We however began to con|ceive that we might form a &s;y&s;tem for our relief, and by a methodical arrangement, entrench our|&s;elves from the a&s;&s;aults of grief: to this end, we formed &s;everal re&s;olutions, and entered into certain engagements&mdash;&s;uch as, never to repine at our fate, <HI>if we could</HI>&mdash;to draw con&s;olation from the more dreadful lot of others, <HI>if we could;</HI>&mdash;and to encou|rage hope&mdash;hope that comes to all; and, on the whole, to confine our conver&s;ation as much as po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;ubjects of an agreeable nature: but the&s;e, like many other rules which we lay down for the conduct of life, were often broken by nece&s;&s;ity, and left us to regret the fallibility of all human pre|cautionary &s;y&s;tems.</P>

<P>MR. HALL having, as I told you in my la&s;t, obligingly agreed to favour me with a rela|tion of his &s;tory, I now give it to you as nearly in his own words as I can remember them. He proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"Although you are now, my dear friend! a witne&s;s to my being the mo&s;t perfectly wretched of all created beings, yet the time is not long pa&s;t when fortune &s;miled upon and gave me promi&s;e of as much happine&s;s as Man in this wretched vale of tears is allowed by his circum&s;cribed nature to hope for. I have &s;een the time, when each revolving &s;un ro&s;e to u&s;her me to a day of joy, and &s;et to con&s;ign me to a night of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e&mdash;when the bounties of Nature, and the productions of Art, were poured with the profu&s;ion of fond pater|nal

affection into my lap&mdash;when troops of friends hailed my ri&s;ing pro&s;pects&mdash;when health and peace made this per&s;on their uninterrupted abode&mdash;and when the mo&s;t benignant love that ever ble&s;&s;ed a mortal filled up the mea&s;ure of my bli&s;s. Yes, CAMPBELL! it was once my happine&s;s, though now, alas! the &s;ource of poignant mi&s;ery, to be ble&s;&s;ed with the be&s;t parents that ever watched over the welfare of a child&mdash;with friends, too, who loved me, and whom my heart cheri&s;hed&mdash; and&mdash;O God! do I think of her, and yet retain my &s;en&s;es&mdash;with the affections of a young lady, than whom providence, in the fullne&s;s of its power and bounty to mankind, never formed one more lovely, one more angelic in per&s;on, more heavenly in di&s;po&s;ition, more rich in intellectual endowments. Alas! my friend, will you, can you pardon tho&s;e warm ebullitions of a fond pa&s;&s;ion? will you for a moment enter into my feelings, and make allowance for tho&s;e tran&s;ports? But how can you? Your friend&s;hip and pity may indeed induce you to excu&s;e this interruption; but, to &s;ympathi&s;e truly, and feel as I feel, you mu&s;t have known the charming girl her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"My father, though he did not move in the very fir&s;t walk of life, held the rank of a Gentle|man by birth and education, and was re&s;pectable, not only as a man of con&s;iderable property, but as a per&s;on who knew how to turn the gifts of for|tune to their be&s;t account: he was generous with|out prodigality, and charitable without o&s;tentation: he was allowed by all who knew him to be the mo&s;t tender of hu&s;bands&mdash;the mo&s;t zealous and &s;incere of friends; and I can bear witne&s;s to his being the be&s;t of parents. As long as I can remember to have been able to make a remark, the tenderne&s;s of both my father and mother knew no bounds: I &s;eemed to occupy all their thoughts, all their atten|tion; and in a few years, as I thank God I never

made un un&s;uitable return for their affection, it in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that their exi&s;tence &s;eemed to hang upon mine.</P>
<P>"To make &s;o much of a child &s;o beloved as his natural talents would allow, no expence was &s;pared in my education: from childhood, every in&s;truc|tion that money could purcha&s;e, and every allure|ment to learn, that fondne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, were be&s;towed upon me: while my beloved father trac|ing the advances I made with the magnifying eye of affection, would hang over me in rapture, and en|joy by anticipation the fame and honours that, overweening fondne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted to him, mu&s;t one day &s;urround me. The&s;e prejudices, my dear friend! ari&s;ing from the exce&s;s of natural affection, are ex|cu&s;eable, if not amiable, and de&s;erve a better fate than di&s;appointment. Alas! my honoured father, you little knew&mdash;and, oh! may you never know, what &s;ort of fame, what &s;ort of honours, await your child! May the angui&s;h he endures, and his mo&s;t calamitious fate, never reach your ears!&mdash;for, too well I know, 'twould give a deadly wrench to your heart, and precipitate you untimely to your grave.</P>
<P>"Thus years rolled on; during which, time &s;eemed to have added new wings to his flight, &s;o quickly did they pa&s;s. Unmarked by any of tho&s;e &s;ini&s;ter events that parcel out the time in weary &s;tages to the unfortunate, it &s;lid on unperceived; and an enlargement in my &s;ize, and an increa&s;e of knowledge, were all I had to inform me that eigh|teen years had pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>It was at this time that I fir&s;t found the &s;mooth current of my tranquility interrupted, and the tide of my feelings &s;welled and agitated, by the acce&s;&s;ion of new &s;treams of &s;en&s;ation&mdash;In &s;hort I became a &s;lave to the delicious pains of Love; and, after having borne them in concealment for a long time, at length collected courage to declare it.

and candour were among the virtues of my belov|ed: &s;he li&s;tened to the prote&s;tations of affection, and ri&s;ing above the little arts of her &s;ex, avowed a reciprocal attachment. The mea&s;ure of my bli&s;s &s;eemed now to be full; the purity of my pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uch, that the thoughts of the gro&s;&s;er animal de&s;ires never once occured; and happy in loving, and being beloved, we pa&s;&s;ed our time in all the in|nocent blandi&s;hments which truly virtuous love in|&s;pires, without our imagination roaming even for an in&s;tant into the wilds of &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>"As I was to inherit a genteel, independent fortune, my father propo&s;ed to breed me up to a learned profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;the Law; rather to invigorate and exerci&s;e my intellects, and as a &s;tep to rank in the &s;tate, than for more lucrative purpo&s;es.

<P>"It was but a few months antecedent to my embarking for the ea&s;tern world, that my father, whom I had far &s;ome time with &s;orrow ob&s;erved thoughtful, &s;tudious and melancholy, took me into his &s;tudy, and, &s;eizing my hand, and looking ear|ne&s;tly into my face, while his countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, a&s;ked me empha|tically, if I thought I had fortitude to bear the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible calamity? I was horror-&s;truck at his emotion, accompanied by &s;uch a que&s;tion&mdash; but replied, I hoped I had. He then a&s;ked me if I had affection enough for him to forgive him if he was the cau&s;e of it? I an&s;wered, that the idea connected with the word <HI>forgivene&s;s,</HI> was that

which I could never be brought by any earthly circum&s;tance to apply to my father; but begged him at once to di&s;clo&s;e the wor&s;t to me&mdash;as, be it what it might, my mi&s;ery could not &s;urpa&s;s what I then felt from the my&s;terious manner in which he then &s;poke.</P>
<P>"He then told me that he was an undone man&mdash; that he had, with the very be&s;t intentions, and with the view of aggrandizing me, engaged in great and important &s;peculations, which, had they &s;uc|ceeded, would have given us a princely fortune&mdash; but, having turned out, unfortunately, the rever&s;e, had left him little above beggary. He added, that he had not the re&s;olution to communicate his lo&s;&s;es to me, until nece&s;&s;ity compelled him to tell me all the truth.</P>
<P>"Although this was a &s;evere &s;hock to me, I en|deavoured to conceal my feelings from my father, on whole account, more than on my own, I was af|fected, and pretended to make as light of it as &s;o very important a misfortune would ju&s;tify; and I had the happine&s;s to perceive that the worthy man took &s;ome comfort from my &s;uppo&s;ed indifference. I conjured him not to let &s;o very trivial a thing as the lo&s;s of property, which could be repaired, break in on his peace of mind or health, which could not; and ob&s;erved to him, that we had all of us &s;till enough&mdash;for that my private property (which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed independent of him, and which a relation left me) would amply &s;upply all our ne|ce&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>"Having thus endeavoured to accommodate my unhappy father's feelings to his lo&s;&s;es, I had yet to accommodate my own; and began to revolve in my mind what was likely to en&s;ue from, and what &s;tep was mo&s;t proper to be taken, in this dreadful change of circum&s;tances. That which lay neare&s;t my heart fir&s;t occurred;&mdash;you will readily gue&s;s that I mean my love; to involve her I lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,

far more, than my life, in the misfortunes of my family, was too horrible a con&s;ideration to be out|weighed even by the dread of lo&s;ing her.

<HEAD>LETTER LII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the day &s;ucceeding that on which the agent of HYAT SAHIB had held the di&s;cour&s;e with me, mentioned in my la&s;t letter but one, I was again &s;ent for, and brought to the &s;ame per&s;on, who a&s;ked me, whether I had duly con&s;idered of the important offer made me by HYAT SAHIB, and of the con&s;equences likely to re&s;ult from a refu&s;al? and he appri&s;ed me at the &s;ame time, that the command of five thou&s;and men was an honour which the fir&s;t Rajahs in the My&s;orean dominions would gra&s;p at with tran&s;port. I told him I was well convinced of the honour &s;uch a command would confer on any man but an Engli&s;hman, who&s;e country being the object of HYDER'S ince&s;|&s;ant

ho&s;tility, would make the acceptance of it in|famy&mdash;that although I knew there were but too many Engli&s;hmen apo&s;tates to their country, I hoped there were but few to be found in India willing to accept of any emoluments, however great, or any temptations, however &s;pecious, to fly from the &s;tandard of their country, and rally round that of its bittere&s;t enemy&mdash;that, for my own part, being of a name ever foremo&s;t in the ranks of loyalty and patrioti&s;m, and of a family that had hitherto detracted nothing from the ho|nours of that name, &s;uch an act of apo&s;tacy would be peculiarly infamous in me, and I could view it in no better light than traitorous and parricidal&mdash; that, independent of all tho&s;e claims, which were of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to deter me, I felt within my&s;elf a principle, perhaps innate, perhaps in&s;pi|red by military habit, that forbade my acceding&mdash; and, finally, appealed to the good &s;en&s;e of HYAT SAHIB, whether a man who in &s;uch circum&s;tances had betrayed his country, and &s;acrificed her inter|e&s;ts to his own convenience, was &s;uch a per&s;on as confidence could properly be put in.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, and a thou&s;and other re|mon&s;trances, which I cannot immediately recollect, but which the hazards of my &s;ituation &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;till continued to pre&s;s me, and u&s;ed every argu|ment, every per&s;ua&s;ion, that ingenuity could dic|tate, or hints of puni&s;hment enforce, to &s;hake my purpo&s;e&mdash;but in vain: attachment to country and family ro&s;e paramount to all other con&s;iderations; and I gave a peremptory, deci&s;ive refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tanced as I was, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to keep an accurate journal of the various incidents that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, or vici&s;&s;itudes of thought that occur|red, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uring the period of my impri&s;onment. In|deed, I was &s;carcely con&s;cious of the length of my captivity, and could not, till I was relea&s;ed, determine exactly how long it had continued. You
<PB N="321" REF="033487_0320_0FF7255D99882DB8">
mu&s;t therefore content your&s;elf to be told in gene|ral terms, that I was repeatedly urged on the &s;ub|ject by fair per&s;ua&s;ives: they then had recour&s;e to menace; then they withheld the daily pittance al|lowed for my &s;upport; and at length proceeded to coercion, tying a rope round my neck, and hoi&s;t|ing me up to a tree. All this, however, I bore firmly: if it had any effect, it was to confirm me in my re&s;olution, and call in policy to the aid of honour's dictates. Every man of feeling or rea|&s;on mu&s;t allow, that it was better to die, than live a life of &s;ubjection to tyranny &s;o truly diabo|lical.</P>
<P>Mr. HALL and I, thus drove to the brink of ex|tinction, yet con&s;oled our&s;elves with the reflection, that tho&s;e whom mo&s;t we loved were not &s;haring our unhappy fate, and were fortunately ignorant of our &s;ufferings; and as I enjoyed perfect good health, hope yet lived within me.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pring, an ela&s;ticity, in every man's mind, of which the owner is rarely, very rarely con&s;cious, becau&s;e fortunately the occa&s;ions &s;eldom occur in which it can be brought to the proof, for, as la&s;&s;itude is the nece&s;&s;ary forerunner of refre&s;h|ment, &s;o is extreme dejection to the mo&s;t vigorous exerei&s;e of our fortitude. So I found it: as the horrors of my &s;ituation thickened round me, I felt my &s;pirits increa&s;e; my re&s;olution became more firm, my hopes more &s;anguine&mdash;I even began to look forward, and form projects for the future: whole hours amu&s;ement, every day and every night, aro&s;e from the contemplation of my beloved boy; I in imagination traced his growth, directed his ri&s;ing &s;entiments, formed plans for his future &s;uc|ce&s;s and pro&s;perity, and indulged by anticipation in all the enjoyment which I now tru&s;t I &s;hall yet have in his ripened manhood.</P>
<P>Thus we continued for many months, during which no alteration what&s;oever took place in our
<PB N="322" REF="033487_0321_0FF72560264C7180">
treatment or &s;ituation. We heard a thou&s;and con|tradictory reports of victories gained over the Eng|li&s;h, and again of &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es on their part: they, however, de&s;i&s;ted to pre&s;s me into then &s;er|vice. The only relief from our &s;ufferings lay in the re&s;ources of our own minds, and in our mutual en|devours to plea&s;e and con&s;ole one another: the cir|cum&s;tances of aggravation were the nece&s;&s;ity of dai|ly bearing witne&s;s to the mo&s;t barbarous puni&s;hments he inflicted upon wretched individuals under the &s;emblance of ju&s;tice, and the occa&s;ional depriva|tion of our food, either by the fraud of the &s;epoys who attended us, or the caprice or cruelty of their &s;uperiors. It is but ju&s;tice, however, to &s;ay, that they were not all alike: &s;ome overflowed with mer|cy, charity, and the milk of human kindne&s;s; while others, again, were almo&s;t as bad men as the &s;overeigns they &s;erved. We were not allowed the u&s;e of pen, ink, or paper; and very &s;eldom could afford our&s;elves the luxury of &s;having, or clean lin|en: nor were we at all &s;heltered from the incle|mency of the weather, till at length a little room was built for us of mud, which being &s;mall and damp, rendered our &s;ituation wor&s;e than it was before.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner whom I have already mentioned, as having, in the time of the former &s;overeign, held the fir&s;t office in Bidanore, &s;till continued op|po&s;ite to me; and he and I at length began to un|der&s;tand each other, and found means, by looks, &s;igns and ge&s;tures, to exchange thoughts, and hold an intercour&s;e of &s;entiments together. From the circum&s;tance of his being a native, and better &s;kil|led in the language than me, he had much better intelligence than I could po&s;&s;ibly have, and he was always eager to convey to me any circum&s;tance or news that he thought might be agreeable: &s;ome me&s;&s;ages al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed between us, by means of the &s;epoys who had alternately been his guard and mine &mdash;for our guards were changed every week.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="033487_0322_0FF72562AEDCD380">Projects and hopes of a new kind now began to intrude them&s;elves on my thoughts; and I con|ceived a de&s;ign, which I flattered my&s;elf was not entirely impracticable to effect an e&s;cape, and even a revolt in the place. A variety of circum&s;tances concurred to per&s;uade me, that the tyranny of HY|DER, and his &s;ervant HYAT SAHIB, was abhorred, though none dared to give vent to their &s;entiments. I thought I could ob&s;erve, that the native pri&s;oner oppo&s;ite to me was privately beloved, and might, from the recollection of his former dignities, have con&s;iderable influence in the place. Several Arcot &s;epoys and their officers (&s;ome of them belonging to my own regiment) were al&s;o pri&s;oners at large; and withal I recollected, that difficulties apparent|ly more &s;tupendous had been overcome by Engli&s;h|men&mdash;having often heard it a&s;&s;erted, that there was not a pri&s;on in the known world out of which a Briti&s;h &s;ubject had not made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Fraught with tho&s;e conceptions, I attempted to &s;ound the officers of the Arcot Sepoys, whether it were not po&s;&s;ible for us to effect our e&s;cape? So ardent is the flame of liberty in all men's brea&s;ts, &s;o great is the dete&s;tation of human nature to &s;lavery, that I perceived a manife&s;t willingne&s;s in the peo|ple about us to join me in an attempt to procure our liberty, or bring about a revolt in the garri&s;on. My heart beat high with the hope; and I began to flatter my&s;elf, that, the day was not far removed when we &s;hould not only bid defiance to our ty|rants, but even make them repent the day on which we were ca&s;t a&s;hore on their coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;tantly &s;ounded all who I thought were likely to concur, upon the practicability of the attempt, and found them, as I conceived, di&s;|po&s;ed to take &s;hare in it, it yet remained to con|&s;ider of the <HI>quomodo</HI>&mdash;and, after having formed the general outlines of a plan, to lick it into &s;hape. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a critical con&s;ideration: the
<PB N="324" REF="033487_0323_0FF7256441D56028">
&s;econd required addre&s;s and management, and was likely to be impeded by the vigilance of the peo|ple about, who would not fail to remark, and take the alarm, from any unu&s;ual intercour&s;e or di&s;cour&s;e between us; and without a mutual communication of thoughts, and full deliberation by all parties con|cerned, as well as knowledge of the fort and its different gates, nothing could, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, be determined&mdash;nothing, without the mo&s;t imminent hazard, be attempted. I therefore held various councils with my own mind, and with Mr. HALL, on the &s;ubject&mdash;mo&s;t of which were abor|tive, without at all di&s;couraging us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I began to think of &s;ounding the Bida|nore pri&s;oner, <HI>ci-devant</HI> governor of the place; and determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring him into our con|&s;ultations, as I had before hoped to make him a party in the execution of the project: but while I was &s;ettling all this much to my own &s;atisfaction, an event occured which extingui&s;hed all my hopes in that way&mdash;of which you &s;hall have an account in my next letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the plan which I men|tioned in my la&s;t was di&s;covered or not, or from what other motive it aro&s;e, I have not to this day been able to decide; but &s;o it was, that while my &s;anguine mind was overflowing with the hope of carrying my project for an e&s;cape into effect, Mr. HALL and I were one day unexpectedly loaded with irons, and fa&s;tened together, leg by leg, by one bolt. This, as nearly as I can compute, was four or five mouths before my relea&s;e. Of all the
<PB N="325" REF="033487_0324_0FF72568E61E77F8">
circum&s;tances of my life, it has made the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind: it unexpectedly and &s;uddenly broke down the mo&s;t plea&s;ing fabric my imagination had ever built. The &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ion|ed by the appearance of the irons, and the precau|tionary manner in which it was undertaken, was indeed great: &s;till more was I &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the per&s;on who was employed to &s;ee this put in execution, manife&s;ted unu&s;ual emotions, &s;eemed much affected, and even &s;hed tears as he looked on: and while the &s;uddenne&s;s and cautionary mode of doing it convinced me that &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance on our part was apprehended, the &s;orrow which the offi|cer who &s;uperintended it di&s;clo&s;ed, portended in my mind a fatal, or at lea&s;t a very &s;erious i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, poor Mr. HALL had for &s;ome time been afflicted with a return of his dreadful di&s;|order, the dy&s;entery; and our being &s;hackled to|gether increa&s;ed an unconquerable mortification of feelings which we had before undergone, from a delicacy of nature that would have done honour to the mo&s;t mode&s;t virgin, be her &s;en&s;ibility ever &s;o exqui&s;ite, or her delicacy ever &s;o extreme&mdash;And here, my dear FREDERICK! I cannot let &s;lip this opportunity of remarking to you, that the man, as well as the woman, who would render him&s;elf tru|ly amiable in the eyes of his fellow-creatures, &s;hould cultivate delicacy and mode&s;ty, as the mo&s;t captivating of all the moral virtues: from them, heroi&s;m derives additional lu&s;tre&mdash;wit, ten-fold force&mdash;religion and morality, the charms of per&s;ua|&s;ion&mdash;and every per&s;onal action of the man, irre|&s;i&s;tible dignity and winning grace. From this un|lucky event, I received a temporary depre&s;&s;ion; and the rapidly increa&s;ing illne&s;s of poor HALL rendered my &s;ituation more than ever calamitous; when, again, my &s;pirits, eagerly prone to gra&s;p at every thing that gave a momentary hope of &s;upport, were a little recruited by confu&s;ed rumours of the
<PB N="326" REF="033487_0325_0FF7256A751E5BB0">
Engli&s;h army having made a de&s;cent on the Mala|bar coa&s;t: and &s;o powerful is the influence of mind on the animal &s;y&s;tem, that Mr. HALL enjoyed from the report a momentary alleviation of his malady; but, having no medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor even &s;uffici|ent &s;u&s;tenance to further the favourable operations of nature, he relap&s;ed again; the di&s;ea&s;e fell upon him with redoubled fury: a very &s;canty portion of boiled rice, with a more &s;canty mor&s;el of &s;tinking &s;alt fi&s;h or putrid fle&s;h, was a very inadequate &s;up|port for me, who, though emaciated, was in health &mdash;and very improper medicine for a per&s;on labour|ing under a malady &s;uch as Mr. HALL'S, which re|quired comfort, good medical &s;kill, and delicate nutritious food. The tea which HYAT SAHIB had given me was expended; and we were not allow|ed to be &s;haved from the hour we were put in irons, an indulgence of that kind being forbidden by the barbarous rules of the pri&s;on: and, to refine upon our tortures &s;leep, "the balm of hurt minds," was not allowed us uninterrupted; for, in confor|mity to another regulation, we were di&s;turbed every half hour by a noi&s;e &s;omething re&s;embling a watch|man's rattle, and a fellow who, &s;triking every part of our irons with a kind of hammer, and examin|ing them le&s;t they &s;hould be cut, broke in upon that kind re&s;torative, and awoke our &s;ouls to fre&s;h horrors.</P>
<P>As it mu&s;t be much more naturally matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that any bodily &s;trength could &s;upport it&s;elf under &s;uch complicated calamities, than that infirmity &s;hould &s;ink beneath them, you will be ra|ther grieved than &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that poor Mr. HALL was now app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oaching to his end with ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly accelerated &s;teps. Every application that I made in his favour was refu&s;ed, or rather treated with cruel neglect and contemptuous &s;ilence; and I fore&s;aw, with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h and indigna|tion, that the barbarians would not abate him in his

la&s;t minutes one jot of mi&s;ery, and that my mo&s;t amiable friend was fated to expire under every at|tendant horror that mere &s;ublunary circum&s;tances could create. But that pity which the mighty, the powerful and enlightened denied, natural be|nevolence operating upon an uninformed mind, and &s;canty means, afforded us. HYAT SAHIB, the powerful, the wealthy, the governor of a great opulent province, refu&s;ed to an expiring fellow-creature a little cheap relief&mdash;while a poor &s;epoy taxed his little means to &s;upply it: one who guard|ed us, of his own accord, at hazard of imminent puni&s;hment, purched us a lamp and a little oil, which we burned for the la&s;t few nights.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers and divines have declaimed upon the advantages of a well-&s;pent life, as felt <HI>in arti|culo mortis;</HI> and their efforts have had, I hope, &s;ome effect upon the lives of many. To witne&s;s one example &s;uch as Mr. HALL held forth, would be worth volumes of precepts on this &s;ubject. The unfeigned re&s;ignation with which he met his di&s;&s;o|lution, and the maje&s;tic fortitude with which he looked in the face the various circum&s;tances of horror that &s;urrounded him, rendered him the mo&s;t dignified object I ever beheld or conceived, and the mo&s;t glorious in&s;tance of con&s;cious virtue tri|umphing over the terrors of death, and the cun|ning barbarity of mankind. Were the progre&s;s of virtue attended with pain, and the practice of vice with plea&s;ure, the adoption of the former would be amply repaid by its &s;oothings in the dreadful moment, even if it were to accompany us no fur|ther. About a quarter of an hour before he died, Mr. HALL broached a mo&s;t tender &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation, which he followed up with a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations, &s;o truly refined, &s;o exqui&s;itely turned, &s;o delicate and &s;o pathetic, that it &s;eemed almo&s;t the language of in&s;piration, as if, in proportion to the decay of the body, intellect increa&s;ed, and the
<PB N="328" REF="033487_0327_0FF72572363503A0">
dying man had become all mind. Such a conver|&s;ation I never remembered to have heard, or heard of. Its effects upon me were wonderful; for, though the combination of melancholy circum&s;tan|ces attending my now critical &s;ituation had almo&s;t rai&s;ed my mind to frenzy, the &s;alutary influence of his words and example controuled the exce&s;&s;es of my &s;en&s;ations; and I met the afflicting moment of his departure with a degree of tranquility, which, though not to be compared to his, has on reflec|tion appeared to me a&s;toni&s;hing. This conver&s;a|tion continued to the very in&s;tant of his death; during which time he held my hand cla&s;ped in his, frequently enforcing his kind expre&s;&s;ions to me with a &s;queeze&mdash;while my &s;orrow, taking its mo&s;t ea&s;y channel, bedewed my face with tears. As he proceeded, my voice was choaked with my feel|ings; and I attempted once or twice in vain to &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k.

<P>The recital of this afflicting event has called up to my fancy &s;o lively a picture of the &s;cene as it pa&s;&s;ed with all its horrors&mdash;horrors which out&s;trip all efforts of de&s;cription, and baffle all power of language&mdash;that my feelings are in part renewed, and I find my&s;elf incapable of proceeding further at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>FOR &s;ome time I was lo&s;t in grief for the death of Mr. HALL. Though I had long ex|pected it, and might con&s;equently be &s;uppo&s;ed to have wa&s;ted great part of my &s;orrow in anticipa|tion; yet, having only con&s;idered and felt the point before his death merely as it re&s;pected him and his misfortunes, a great portion of the calamity yet remained unconceived: and, now that he was dead, I began for the fir&s;t time to con&s;ider and feel the &s;ubject as it concerned my&s;elf.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s to you the ago|nies of mind I underwent during the re&s;t of the night. In the morning a report was made to the commandant, of the death of Mr. HALL; and in about an hour after, he pa&s;&s;ed me by, but kept his face purpo&s;ely turned away from me to the other &s;ide. I patiently waited for the removal of the dead body till the evening, when I de&s;ired the Se|poys who guarded me to apply for its being remov|ed. They returned, and told me that they could get no an&s;wer re&s;pecting it. Night came on, but there was no appearance of an intention to unfetter me from the corp&s;e. The commandant was &s;itting in his court, admini&s;tering, in the manner I have before de&s;cribed, <HI>ju&s;tice!</HI> I called out to him my&s;elf with all my might, but could get no an&s;wer from him. Nothing could equal my rage and con&s;terna|tion; for, exclu&s;ive of the painful idea of being &s;hackled to the dead body of a friend I loved, an|other circum&s;tance contributed to make it a &s;erious &s;ubject of horror. In tho&s;e ciimates the weather is &s;o inten&s;ely hot, that putrefaction almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;ucceeds death, and meat that is killed in the morn|ing, and kept in the &s;hade, will be unfit for dre&s;|&s;ing at night. In a &s;ubject, then, on which pu|trefaction had made advances even before death, and which remained expo&s;ed to the open air, the proce&s;s mu&s;t have been much more rapid. So far, however, from compa&s;&s;ionating my &s;ituation, or indulging me by a removal of the body, their barba|rity &s;ugge&s;ted to them to make it an in&s;trument of
<PB N="331" REF="033487_0330_0FF72577FAF6CD88">
puni&s;hment; and they pertinaciou&s;ly adhered to the mo&s;t mortifying &s;ilence and di&s;regard of my complaints. For &s;everal days and nights it remain|ed attached to me by the irons. I grew almo&s;t di&s;|tracted&mdash;wi&s;hed for the means of putting an end to my mi&s;eries by death, and could not move without witne&s;&s;ing &s;ome new &s;tage of putre&s;cence it attained, or breathe without inhaling the putrid effluvia that aro&s;e from it&mdash;while myriads of flies and loath&s;ome in&s;ects re&s;ted on it, the former of which every now and then vi&s;ited me, crawling over my face and hands, and lighting in hundreds on my victuals. I never look back at this cri&s;is without confu&s;ion, horror, and even a&s;toni&s;hment; and, were it not connected with a chain of events preceding and &s;ub|&s;equent to it, too well known by re&s;pectable peo|ple to be doubted, and too much interwoven with a part of the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t war in India to ad|mit of a doubt, I &s;hould not only be afraid to tell, but ab&s;olutely doubt my&s;elf whether the whole was not the illu&s;ion of a dream, rather than credit the po&s;&s;ibility of my enduring &s;uch unheard of hard|&s;hips without lo&s;s of life or deprivation of &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when the body had reached that &s;hock|ing loath&s;ome &s;tate of putrefaction which threaten|ed that further delay would render removal abomi|nable, if not impo&s;&s;ible, the mon&s;ters agreed to take it away from me&mdash;and I was &s;o far relieved: but the mortification and injury I underwent from it, joined to the agitation of the preceding week, made a vi&s;ible inroad on my health. I totally lo&s;t my &s;pirits; my appetite entirely for&s;ook me: my long-nouri&s;hed hopes fled; and I looked forward to death as the only de&s;irable event that was within the verge of likelihood or po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>One day, my oppo&s;ite friend (the native pri&s;oner) gave me a look of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and encou|raging kind; and I perceived a more than u&s;ual bu&s;tle in the citadel, while the &s;epoys informed
<PB N="332" REF="033487_0331_0FF7257E4D525AC8">
me that they were ordered on immediate &s;ervice, and that &s;ome events of great importance had taken place. From this feeble gleam, my mind, natu|rally active, though depre&s;&s;ed by circum&s;tances of unu&s;ual weight, again took fire, and hope bright|ened with a kind of gloomy light the pro&s;pect be|fore me: I revolved a thou&s;and things, and drew from them a thou&s;and &s;urmi&s;es; but all as yet was only conjecture with me. In a day or two, the bu&s;tle increa&s;ed to a high pitch, accompanied with marks of con&s;ternation: the whole of the troops in the citadel were ordered to march; and the commandant, and a man with a hammar and in&s;tru|ments, came to take off my irons.</P>
<P>While they were at work taking off my irons, I perceived they were taking off tho&s;e of the native pri&s;oner oppo&s;ite to me al&s;o. He went away under a guard: we looked at each other complacently, nodded and &s;miled, as who &s;hould &s;ay, "we hope to &s;ee one another in happier times not far di&s;tant." But, alas! vain are human hopes, and &s;hort and dark is the extent of our utmo&s;t fore&s;ight! This unhappy man, without committing any &s;ort of of|fen&s;e to merit it, but in conformity to the damna|ble, barbarous pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly of tho&s;e countries, was, by the Jemadar's orders, taken forth, and his throat cut! This the Jemadar him&s;elf afterwards acknow|ledged to me&mdash;and, what was &s;till more abominable if po&s;&s;ible, undertook to ju&s;tify the proceeding upon the principles of rea&s;on, &s;ound &s;en&s;e, and precedent of A&s;iatic policy.</P>
<P>In order to elucidate the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to recur to events which hap|pened antecedent to this time, but of which, by rea&s;on of my &s;ituation, I was then entirely igno|rant; and as they involve, not only the grounds of my &s;ub&s;equent e&s;cape and proceedings, but a con&s;iderable portion of hi&s;torical fact, and &s;ome of the material intere&s;ts of the Ea&s;t India Company,

<P>HYDER ALLI KHAWN, late Nabob of My&s;ore, and father to the pre&s;ent TIPPO SAHIB SULTAIN, was as extraordinary a man, and perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as great natural talents, as any recorded in the page of hi&s;tory. Born and bred up in the low|e&s;t ranks of an unenlightened and ignorant people, and to the la&s;t day of his life perfectly illiterate, he not only emerged from his native ob&s;curity by the vigor of his mind and body, but became an object of terror and admiration to &s;urrounding potentates. Early initiated in the habits and inured to the toils of a military life, he ro&s;e, by the gradual &s;teps of promotion, to a rank which afforded an opportunity of di&s;playing his capacity and prowe&s;s: he &s;oon obtained the command of that army in which he had once &s;erved as a common &s;oldier, and immedi|ately demon&s;trated that the &s;ublimity of his mind was formed to keep pace with his extraordinary elevation.</P>
<P>The Marhattas, the mo&s;t formidable people in Hither India, bordered on the My&s;orean domin|ions, and kept their neighbours, by frequent ho&s;|tilities, in a continual &s;tate of awe&mdash;making incur|&s;ions on their territories, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by force of arms, of large portions of their country: but no &s;ooner had HYDER got the command of the armies of his country, than he drove back the Mar|hattas
<PB N="334" REF="033487_0333_0FF725827648B698">
from the My&s;orean dominions, which he ex|tended by con&s;iderable acqui&s;itions from the Mar|hatta frontiers; and followed up his conque&s;ts with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;sful ardour, that he compelled that war|like nation to re&s;pect his countrymen as their equals, if not &s;uperiors, in military achievement. Thus, while he ingratiated him&s;elf with his &s;overeign and fellow-citizens by his wi&s;dom, he acquired the ad|miration of the &s;oldiery by his per&s;onal addre&s;s and valour; and at the &s;ame time, by the &s;everity of his decipline, and the occa&s;ional au&s;terity of his deportmet, maintained an awe over them, which &s;trengthened his authority with dimini&s;hing their affection.</P>
<P>HYDER was therefore now arrived at that point of elevation, beyond which no exertion of mental capacity, if governed by virtue or integrity, could rai&s;e him&mdash;So far he owed all to guenius: but his towering ambition looked higher; and, unre&s;train|ed by any principle of religion or morality, he de|termined to accompli&s;h, at any rate, that which he knew nothing but crime could accompli&s;h. With wicked deliberation he looked forward into the womb of time, and with unparalleled policy arran|ged the whole &s;y&s;tem upon which he was to act, when that order of things his penetrating and in|tuitive genius enabled him to &s;ee would naturally ari&s;e from each other, &s;hould afford him a proper opportunity. Although he was utterly ignorant of books, and of cour&s;e could derive little benefit from the examples of the great and ambitious men recorded in hi&s;tory, yet, drawing upon the infinite re&s;ources of his own mind for information, he adopted the very &s;ame means of furthering his views; and fore&s;eeing, that, with an immen&s;e ar|my devoted to his intere&s;ts, few things would be unattainable, he applied him&s;elf diligently to model and form that of the KING of MYSORE to the greate&s;t perfection in di&s;cipline, and to render it
<PB N="335" REF="033487_0334_0FF725852C72DC48">
attached to his per&s;on, and &s;ub&s;ervient to his views, by a &s;kilful mixture of &s;everity and relaxation, toil and reward, danger and applau&s;e, which none but a ma&s;ter-hand like his was capable of exactly com|pounding.</P>
<P>The death of his &s;overeign the KING of MY|SORE at length afforded him the opportunity to which he had &s;o long, and with &s;o prophetic an eye, looked forward&mdash;and gave him ample room for &s;elf gratulation on the &s;core of his &s;agacity and prudence.</P>
<P>The heir in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne being then an infant, the politic HYDER, &s;etting a&s;ide all claims of the kindred of the young prince, took upon him&s;elf the guardian&s;hip&mdash;under the title of Regent a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme authority&mdash;and, though too well aware of the inviolable attachment of the people to their lawful monarch to put him directly to death, u&s;urped the throne, and con&s;igned him to impri&s;onment in Seringapatam, the capital of the My&s;orean dominions.</P>
<P>Having thus, by his talents, acquired the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the throne, he gave a large range to the &s;ub|limity of his views, and &s;oon di&s;played the exhau&s;t|le&s;s re&s;ources of his mind in the new office of Go|vernor and Legi&s;lator&mdash;forming &s;uch va&s;t well-or|dered military e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;uch judicious and &s;alutary civil in&s;titutions, as made him blaze forth at once the terror of his neighbours, and ren|dered him, in the &s;equel, the mo&s;t powerful and formidable potentate in the Hither Penin&s;ula. In carrying on tho&s;e, his deficiency in letters was &s;up|plied by his vigilance and &s;agacity, &s;harpened by &s;u&s;picion: three &s;ecretaries executed all his orders in &s;eparate apartments: and if, on compari&s;on, they were found to differ, he who committed the error received &s;entence of death. His natural cru|elty made him take the execution of their &s;entence upon him&s;elf not unfrequently: to &s;lice off a
<PB N="336" REF="033487_0335_0FF72587B402BE38">
head with his own hand, or &s;ee it done by others, was a luxurious recreation to the &s;anguinary HYDER.</P>
<P>The natural &s;agacity of this great man &s;ugge&s;ted, that in order to accompli&s;h the exten&s;ive objects which his active and ambitious temper held up to his imagination, the introduction of the mo&s;t per|fect military di&s;cipline was above all other things nece&s;&s;ary; and his judgment informed him that the European was the be&s;t. He therefore held out the mo&s;t tempting allurements to military adventures, and particularly to tho&s;e, whether black or white, who had been trained in the &s;ervice of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company: he &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries, for the purpo&s;e, to all parts of India, with in&s;tructions to offer great rewards; and carried this de&s;ign &s;o far, that whenever accident or war threw per&s;ons of that de&s;cription into his hands, he never failed to detain them, and, if they refu&s;ed to enter into his &s;ervice, treat them with the mo&s;t unpardonable rigour and barbarity; and by the&s;e means brought his army to a &s;tate of perfection till then unknown to a black power. He did not &s;top there, but determined to e&s;tabli&s;h a navy&mdash;by large offers allured many &s;hip-carpenters and artizans from Bombay&mdash;made no in|con&s;iderable progre&s;s in con&s;tructing dock-yards, and had actually equiped &s;ome &s;hips <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the line, be&s;ides frigates, fitted to encounter European &s;eas. Indeed, he &s;eemed to have carried his views of con|que&s;t even to the Polar regions; for it is a fact, that he directed his people, in con&s;tructing tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, to fit them for encountering &s;eas of ice, or, as he called it, the thick water.</P>
<P>To a man of &s;uch ardent ambition and deep pene|tration, the va&s;t power which the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t In|dia company had acquired, and were daily acquir|ing, in the Ea&s;t, could not fail to be an object of jealou&s;y. He conceived a deadly and implacable animo&s;ity to the Briti&s;h Nation, which influenced
<PB N="337" REF="033487_0336_0FF7258AC9E17AE0">
his whole &s;ucceeding life, ended only with his death, and was then tran&s;mitted to his &s;on TIPPOO SAHIB, with the exaction of a &s;olemn oath, ever to retain tho&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>A coincidence of circum&s;tances, which has &s;el|dom occured in the fortunes of men, tended, at a lucky cri&s;is, to further the bold projects of HYDER; and neither fortune, though extremely propitious to him, nor his own unbounded talents and ener|getic &s;pirit, favoured the execution of them, more than the bungling politics, the ludicrous ambition, and the con&s;equent unju&s;t fiable proceedings, of one of our Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">encies in India&mdash;I mean Bombay. Fortunately, the wi&s;dom and moderation of our Ea&s;t India councils at this day, vindicate the wounded character of the Briti&s;h nation, and ju&s;ti|fy me in the remarks I make.</P>
<P>An ambitious and profligate chief of the Marhat|ta Tribes&mdash;his name RAGANAUT ROW&mdash;had been depo&s;ed by the wi&s;e men of his country, for having murdered his nephew, in order to u&s;urp the throne of Setterah. He fled to Bombay, and, by &s;pecious promi&s;es and other means, prevailed on that Pre&s;i|dency to afford him an a&s;ylum, and finally to take up arms in his defence again&s;t the united Marhatta States, who at the very time were able to rai&s;e an army of three hundred thou&s;and fighting men. Ho&s;tilities were fir&s;t commenced by the Engli&s;h; and by them peace was fir&s;t propo&s;ed. The treaty of Poonah was made, by which it was provided that RAGANAUT ROW would quit Bombay; and by the Engli&s;h the provi&s;ions of that treaty were broken&mdash;for, in direct violation of it RAGANAUT was kept at Bombay. This breach of the treaty led to another; for this crafty and unprincipled chief made u&s;e of it with &s;uch addre&s;s as to per|&s;uade that Pre&s;idency to attack the Marhattas again: &mdash;by magnifying the power of his party among his countrymen, he prevailed upon them once more
<PB N="338" REF="033487_0337_0FF7258DAF013400">
to a&s;&s;ert his rights; and the Pre&s;idency of Calcutta, I am afraid, were induced to join that of Bombay in the plan.</P>
<P>It happened unfortunately, that at this time the Pre&s;idency of Bombay was compo&s;ed of per&s;ons the mo&s;t unqualified, probably, that could be found in any community for offices of &s;uch importance. One, particularly, was allowed, by the almo&s;t una|nimous con&s;ent of tho&s;e who knew his private or public character, to be ignorant, not only of the fir&s;t principles of government, but of the ordinary knowledge requi&s;ite for a gentleman; and for &s;itua|tions of moment he was peculiarly di&s;qualified by a fondne&s;s for minutiae, to which he paid more at|tention than to matters of greater con&s;equence. A temper and intellect of this kind were rendered &s;till more incapable of the enlarged views any Repre&s;entative of a great Nation in a di&s;tant colo|ny &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, by a mercantile education and habits, which narrowed even his circum&s;cribed mind, and left him not a &s;entiment, not an idea, that was not merely commercial. The admini&s;tra|tion of &s;uch men was exactly what might have been expected; and, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting the dignity of Great Britain, or promoting the advantage of their employers&mdash;narrow policy, &s;elfi&s;h views, and ef|forts ari&s;ing from mi&s;taken notions of conque&s;t, made the whole ti&s;&s;ue of their conduct in India.</P>
<P>Blinded by the plau&s;ible in&s;inuations of RAGA|NAUT, and &s;timulated, as I have already ob&s;erved, by a lu&s;t for conque&s;t, which would have been un|ju&s;tifiable even in an hereditary de&s;pot, but which were peculiarly vicious and ridiculous in a body of merchants who were them&s;elves &s;ubjects, the Ea&s;t India company's &s;ervants again determined to &s;up|port, by force of arms, that mo&s;t atrocious mur|derer: and with the contemptibly inadequate force of four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hou&s;and men, encumbered with an un|wieldy train of baggage and &s;ervants for the ac|commodation
<PB N="339" REF="033487_0338_0FF7258F4FEC4370">
of finikin voluptuous officers, and led by two doughty compting-hou&s;e champions (CARNAC and MOSTYN), with colonel EGERTON as <HI>military a&s;&s;i&s;tant</HI> rather than commander, they &s;et out, to encounter the whole torrent of the Mar|hatta force, and conduct RAGANAUT to Poonah.</P>
<P>Had RAGANAUT advanced at the head of his own partizans only, the chiefs of the Marhatta Nation might po&s;&s;ibly have taken different &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and left between them a breach for his arms or intrigues to make an entrance fatal to the general cau&s;e of the country: but the a&s;&s;aults of a foreign army&mdash;an army of intere&s;ted peculat|ing &s;trangers, as the company's troops then were&mdash; an army of avowed natural enemies, profe&s;&s;ing a different religion, entertaining different political principles, and formed by nature of a different complexion&mdash;rou&s;ed and united them in one com|mon cau&s;e, and compre&s;&s;ed di&s;cordant intere&s;ts, which had been for time immemorial at irreconcila|ble variance, into one compact body of re&s;i&s;tance, which, as it became more firm from the &s;trokes of ho&s;tility, could not, in the nature of things, be &s;ubdued; in the &s;ame manner as the unju&s;tifiable confederacy of kings again&s;t France lately united all the conflicting parties of that country&mdash;con|verted twenty-&s;even millions of people, male and female, into one compact armed force&mdash;rendered them not only invincible at home, but terrible abroad&mdash;and finally, has enabled them to be&s;tride, Colo&s;&s;us like, the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>THE approach of the Briti&s;h troops with RAGANAUT cau&s;ed great alarm at Poonah; and the mini&s;ters there &s;ent to offer terms, which were con|temptuou&s;ly rejected. They then determined to &s;ave, by prowe&s;s, tho&s;e rights which they could not pre&s;erve by ju&s;tice or negociation&mdash;and took the field with &s;uch great force, that their menacing enemies found it expedient to con&s;ider of a retreat. The <HI>faithful</HI> RAGANAUT, finding his plans baffled, &s;ent privately to SCINDIAH, the Marhatta chief, propo&s;ing to him to attack the Engli&s;h, and pro|mi&s;ing in that ca&s;e to join him with his part of the army: his perfidy, however, being di&s;covered, the Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h commanders began to retreat, carrying him along with them. They were, however, &s;ur|rounded, and reduced to make the mo&s;t abject con|ce&s;&s;ions&mdash;offering a <HI>carte-blanche</HI> to SCINDIAH as the price of a retreat: but that augu&s;t chief nobly di&s;dained to take advantage of their &s;ituation, and contented him&s;elf with terms which ju&s;tice &s;hould have ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted from them, even if nece&s;&s;ity had not compelled their acceptance. The re&s;toration of Sal&s;ette, and of the other conque&s;ts made by the company's troops during the preceding ho&s;tilities, and the delivery of RAGANAUT'S per&s;on into the hands of the Marhattas, were among the prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions. RAGANAUT was delivered up: two he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s were taken for the remaining part of the treaty, and the harra&s;&s;ed remains of the Engli&s;h army were per|mitted to return to Bombay.</P>
<P>RAGANAUT having found means to e&s;cape, reach|ed S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and the company's chiefs refu&s;ed to com|ply

with the provi&s;ions of the treaty: notwith|&s;tanding which, the noble Marhatta di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ho&s;tages, and prepared for a more manly revenge than that which could be wreaked on two defence|le&s;s individuals. General GODDART, who had been &s;ent with an army from Bengal, was commi&s;|&s;ioned to negociate for a pacification: but SCIN|DIAH making the delivery of RAGANAUT into his hands an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary, the negociation was broken off, and both parties determined to re|fer the controver&s;y to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;eemed to con&s;pire to cha&s;ti&s;e the ra&s;hne&s;s and folly of our Indian councils. The difficulties in which our American conte&s;t had in|volved the nation, were reported with exaggera|tion in India, and gave additional firmne&s;s to our enemies in that quarter. The re&s;tle&s;s and intrigu|ing &s;pirit of the court of Ver&s;ailles found its way with Mon&s;ieur ST. LUBIN to the &s;hores of Indo&s;|tan, and &s;o powerfully worked upon the mind of HYDER, that he entered into a treaty with France again&s;t England, and brought the &s;trength of both into the mo&s;t formidable combination that ever was made in that country, to root out the power of Great Britain from the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus, by the depraved politics of the councils of a petty &s;ettlement, were the important intere&s;ts of Great Britain in India, and the lives and pro|perties of all its &s;ervants in that quarter, at once expo&s;ed to the fury of three formidable ho&s;tile powers&mdash;the Marhattas, HYDER and the French.</P>
<P>I will not entangle my narrative with a detail of the various military operations which aro&s;e from this confederacy: they were in general di&s;a&s;trous to the Engli&s;h, who&s;e power there was pre&s;erved from utter annihilation by the energetic councils of Mr. HASTINGS, the unexampled courage of our troops, and the unparalleled abilities and gal|lantry of the veteran Sir EYRE COOTE. That
<PB N="342" REF="033487_0341_0FF72598DEF2BAC0">
part which applies to my pre&s;ent narrative, is the only part I think it nece&s;&s;ary to detail; but I wi&s;h you to inform your&s;elf of all of them fully, by an attentive peru&s;al of the different hi&s;tories of that war.</P>
<P>In order to relieve the Carnatic, which was &s;uf|fering under the ravages of a formidable victorious army, who had not only cut off a great part of our forces on that coa&s;t, but affronted our army even at the walls of Fort St. George, de&s;cents upon the coa&s;ts of Malabar were planned, in order to make a diver&s;ion: and General MATHEWS, in January 1783, landed with a &s;mall army under his com|mand, at a place called Rajamondroog&mdash;took Onore, and &s;everal forts: and being joined by other troops, which, under the command of Colonel HUMBERT|SON, had done con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the &s;outh|ward, and were now commanded by Colonel MAC|LEOD, marched from Cundapore, with an army con&s;i&s;ting of twelve hundred Europeans and eight battalions of Sepoys, towards Huff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingurry Ghaut, a pa&s;s that leads over the&s;e immen&s;e mountains which divide the penin&s;ula, running north and &s;outh from Per&s;ia to Cape Comorin.

<P>I have thus digre&s;&s;ed from the &s;traight path of my narrative, in order to explain to you the occa|&s;ion
<PB N="343" REF="033487_0342_0FF7259D62D54838">
of the extraordinary revolution that &s;o &s;ud|denly took place in the fort, which I &s;tated to you in my la&s;t letter but one&mdash;You will therefore look back to the conclu&s;ion of that letter, from whence I again take up my narrative.</P>
<P>I was utterly at a lo&s;s to conjecture what this &s;o &s;udden re&s;olution to relea&s;e me and my oppo&s;ite fellow-pri&s;oner meant. I endeavoured to get &s;ome explanation of it from the per&s;ons about me; but all I could at the time collect was, that the Jema|dar had directed me to be taken out of irons, and ordered me to appear before him. I walked out of the citadel with two or three men who had got charge of me: it was a delightful afternoon; and my &s;en&s;ations on once more vi&s;iting the open air&mdash; at again viewing the va&s;t expan&s;e of the firmament above, and the profu&s;ion of beauties with which nature embelli&s;hed the earth beneath&mdash;were too bli&s;sful, too &s;ublime for de&s;cription. My heart beat with involuntary tran&s;ports of gratitude to that Being from which all &s;prung; and I felt that man is, in his nature, even without the intervention of his rea&s;on, a being of devotion. For an hour of &s;uch delight as I then experienced, a year of impri&s;onment was, I thought, hardly too dear a price. Tho&s;e exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations in&s;en&s;ibly led my heart to the mo&s;t flattering pre&s;ages; the ani|mal &s;pirit appeared to have, in corre&s;pondence with the body, &s;haken off a load of chains; and as I walked along, I &s;eemed to tread on air.</P>
<P>As we proceeded forward, we found, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the fort, an open dooly, into which the guards forcibly crammed me; and I was carried off, &s;till attended by the &s;ame men. As we went along, they gave me to under&s;tand that HYAT SA|HIB, the Jemadar, was at a place ten or a dozen miles di&s;tant from Bidanore. I thought it within my&s;elf a mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance, and was at a lo&s;s to conjecture for what purpo&s;e he required
<PB N="344" REF="033487_0343_0FF7259EF10915D8">
my pre&s;ence there. Perhaps, thought I, it is to deliver me per&s;onally into the hands of TIPPOO&mdash; perhaps to &s;end me to Seringapatam. Su&s;pence whetted my curio&s;ity; and impatience to know my fate, &s;et my mind afloat upon a wide &s;ea of conjec|ture. Still, however, my &s;en&s;es acknowledged a degree of plea&s;ure inde&s;cribable&mdash;I inhaled the fre&s;h air with greedine&s;s, and, as I &s;nuffed it in, &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Well, well&mdash;at the wor&s;t, this will enliven my &s;pirits, and lay up a new &s;tock of health and vigour, to enable me to endure with manhood whatever other &s;ufferings the barbarians, into who&s;e hands I have fallen, may have in &s;tore for me."</P>
<P>When we had got about a mile from the fort, we met a per&s;on attended by three others, all on hor&s;eback. He was a man of con&s;iderable rank in that country, and I recollected to have &s;een him at the Jemadar's Durbar, where he had manife&s;ted a favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards me, looking always graciou&s;ly, and nodding to me, which, con&s;idering my circum&s;tances and his, was not a little extraor|dinary. The moment he recognized me, he leaped from his hor&s;e, apparently in great agitation: then turning to the guards, ordered them to leave me immediately&mdash;&s;aying at the &s;ame time that he would be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences. They &s;eemed at fir&s;t to he&s;itate whether they would obey him or not; but on his &s;haking at them his &s;word, which was all along drawn in his hand, and &s;mear|ed with blood, and repeating his orders a &s;econd time in a firm and deci&s;ive tone of voice and man|ner, they all ran off.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were alone, he revealed to me, that he had all along known who I was&mdash;had mo&s;t heartily pitied my &s;ufferings, and privately enter|tained the mo&s;t anxious wi&s;hes to &s;erve me, but could not venture to interfere&mdash;the lea&s;t jealou&s;y, when once awakened, being there always followed

up by &s;ummary vengeance. He then mentioned his name, informing me that he was the &s;on of a Na|bob near Vellore, who&s;e dominions had been wre&s;t|ed from him by force, and united to the Carnatic; that his family had received great favours from my father, in return for which he felt him&s;elf bound to do me every &s;ervice in his power; but that, hav|ing been, after the misfortunes which befel his fa|mily, taken into the &s;ervice of HYDER, and hold|ing then a place of con&s;equence under him, he was di&s;qualified from demon&s;trating his gratitude and e&s;teem in the way he wi&s;hed; he added, he had ju&s;t come from the &s;ummit of the Ghauts, where he left the Engli&s;h army po&s;ted, after their having beat the Circar troops, and carried all the &s;trong works which had been erected for the defence of the pa&s;&s;es, and were deemed from their &s;ituation impregnable; that the Jemadar, HYAT SAHIB, had gone there to encourage the troops, and ani|mate them to one grand effort of re&s;i&s;tance, and would remain there till the &s;ucceeding day&mdash;Here he &s;topped, and &s;eemed much agitated; but recov|ering him&s;elf &s;oon, &s;aid, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olemn and alarming manner, "This day I heard HYAT SAHIB give or|ders to bring you before him, in order that he might &s;atiate his revenge by your dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h!

As well as my limitted knowledge of the language of the country enabled me, I endeavoured to make him a &s;uitable acknowledgement: in &s;uch a cau&s;e, dullne&s;s mu&s;t have become eloquent: and I lamented that my deficiency in the language pre|vented my giving vent to the extreme fullne&s;s of my heart. He &s;eemed, however, to be &s;ati&s;fied with my meaning; and I was ju&s;t on the point of re|turning with him to Hydernagur, when we were &s;uddenly &s;tartled by the Jemadar's mu&s;ic, which was &s;oon afterwards &s;ucceeded by the appearance of his guards advancing towards us at &s;ome di&s;|tance. He &s;eemed confounded and alarmed&mdash;la|mented, in warm terms, his incapacity to &s;erve me &mdash;and, pointed to a path which wound through a wood that lay on either &s;ide of the road, directed me to &s;trike into it immediately, &s;aying, that by following that route, I &s;hould certainly fall in with the Briti&s;h army. He then rode away, and I fol|lowed his advice, and proceeded for &s;ome time through the wood without interruption; for, though I did not implicitly believe the a&s;&s;ertion that HYAT SAHIB meant to have cut me off, I deemed it prudent to avail my&s;elf of the opportuni|ty which offered to effect my e&s;cape, apprehending a wor&s;e fate than death, namely, being &s;ent pri&s;oner to Seringapatam.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf fairly extricated, I began to exa|mine my &s;ituation, and to reflect on the different conver&s;ations which had pa&s;&s;ed between HYAT SA|HIB and me, and on his conduct previous to my being put in irons. I recollected the information I had from time to time received, touching the
<PB N="347" REF="033487_0346_0FF725A71F689A88">
Jemadar's di&s;po&s;ition, HYDER'S death, TIPPOO SAHIB'S character and avowed hatred of HYAT, and the nature of the inhabitants. I moreover took into con&s;ideration, that my &s;trength was im|paired, and my con&s;titution undermined; and that my pro&s;pects in India, in point of &s;ame or emolu|ment, could only be promoted by &s;ome extraordi|nary exertion, or &s;ome hazardous enterpri&s;e. The re&s;ult of the whole was a determination on my part to return back to the fort, and venture an attempt to per&s;uade the Jemadar to offer propo&s;als for an accomodation to General MATHEWS, and to make me the in&s;trument of his negociation.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this determination, I returned; and about &s;ix o'clock in the evening re-entered the fort, and proceeded to the palace of the Jemadar, where, de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing an audience, I was admitted. At the very fir&s;t &s;ight of him, I could perceive in his appearance all the mortification of falling power. He received me with a gloomy countenance, in which there was more of thoughtful &s;adne&s;s than of vindictive fury. After a minute's &s;ilence, how|ever, he &s;aid to me, "Well, Sir! you have heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the Engli&s;h army are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ghauts, and doubtle&s;s know that the cu&s;|toms of this country authori&s;e my proceeding again&s;t you with the utmo&s;t rigor." Here he pau&s;ed for a few moments&mdash;then proceeded thus: "Neverthe|le&s;s, in con&s;ideration of your family&mdash;in con&s;ide|ration of the regard I have for a long time conceiv|ed for you, from ob&s;erving your conduct, and &s;trict adherence to truth in an&s;wering all my que&s;tions, and &s;till more on account of the &s;uffering which you have &s;u&s;tained with fortitude, I will allow you to e&s;cape: ha&s;te you, then, away&mdash;fly from this fort directly&mdash;Begone!" Then waving his hand as a &s;ignal for me to depart, averted his face from me, and looked another way.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="033487_0347_0FF725AD54FADD68">I thought that this was a very favourable oppor|tunity for my intended purpo&s;e, and entreated him to hear me while I &s;aid a few words of perhaps more moment to him than to my&s;elf. He again turned towards me; and, nodding a&s;&s;ent, while his eye be&s;poke impatient curio&s;ity, I proceeded&mdash; And, fir&s;t, I expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t terms I was able, the high &s;en&s;e I entertained of the favourable reception I met with when I fir&s;t came to the fort; a&s;&s;uring him, that I &s;hould never forget the kind|ne&s;s he &s;hewed me on that occa&s;ion&punc; and that in my con&s;cience I imputed all the &s;ufferings I had un|dergone wholly to orders which he had been oblig|ed to execute, and not to any want of humanity in him&s;elf. Here I perceived the clouds wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch had over&s;pread his countenance begin gradually to di&s;|per&s;e, and with the greater confidence proceeded to &s;ay, that if he would conde&s;cend to give me a patient hearing, and not take my boldne&s;s ami&s;s, I would venture to intrude upon him with my ad|vice. At this he &s;tared at me with a look of &s;ur|pri&s;e&mdash;pau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed&mdash;then &s;aid, that he authori&s;ed me to &s;peak whatever I plea&s;ed&mdash;continuing, in a tone of gentle melancholy, "But of what u&s;e can your advice be to me now?"</P>
<P>Having thus obtained his permi&s;&s;ion, I began by complimenting him on his great talents and temper in governing&mdash;on his fidelity, zeal and attachment to HYDER&mdash;and on the mild and beneficient u&s;e which he was acknowledged to have made of the unbounded power ve&s;ted in him by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Prince, which was the more extraordinary, con&s;idering how many examples he had to ju&s;tify him in a contrary practice. I reminded him, however, that circum|&s;tances were at pre&s;ent widely different from what they were&mdash;that he had now got a very different &s;overeign to &s;erve&mdash;that he had no longer the ten|der father (for to HYDER might have been con&s;i|dered to him), but TIPPOO SULTAN, now the

ma&s;ter, once the rival, who&s;e mea&s;ures he had al|ways oppo&s;ed, again&s;t whom he had once laid a mo&s;t &s;erious charge, and who, con&s;idering the firmne&s;s of his nature, could not be rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed to have forgiven him; and I hinted, that whatever external appearance of regard TIPPOO might from the political nece&s;&s;ity of the moment a&s;&s;ume, his temper, and the &s;pirit of A&s;iatic policy, were too well known to have a doubt remaining, that &s;o far from continuing him (HYAT) in the &s;ame power and authority which he enjoyed during the life of his father HYDER, he would, on the con|trary, proceed again&s;t him with rigor and cruelty.</P>
<P>Here I perceived the Jemadar involuntary nod|ding his head in a manner which, though not in|tended for my ob&s;ervation, denoted internal a&s;&s;ent; and was convinced that I had exactly fallen in with the current of his own thoughts. No wonder, indeed, they &s;hould be his &s;entiments; for they had long been the &s;entiments of all per&s;ons who had known the circum&s;tances of the Nabob's fa|mily.</P>
<P>Having, therefore, gone as far on that point as I conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary to awaken the mind of HYAT to the precariou&s;ne&s;s, of rather danger of his &s;ituation with TIPPOO, I painted to him, in the &s;tronge&s;t colours I was ma&s;ter of, the humanity, the fidelity, the bravery and genero&s;ity of the En|gli&s;h, which, I &s;aid, were &s;o univer&s;ally acknow|ledged, that even their wor&s;t enemies bore te&s;ti|mony to them: and I a&s;&s;ured him, that if, in&s;tead of making an unavailing oppo&s;ition to them, he would throw him&s;elf with confidence upon their protection, and become their friend, he would not only be continued in his &s;tation, power and autho|rity, and &s;upported as heretofore, but be made a much greater man, with &s;till greater &s;ecurity, than ever he had been before.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="033487_0349_0FF725B07558BD00">This was the general &s;cope of my argument with him; but there were many more which &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves at the time, though I cannot now re|member them. I enforced them with all the pow|er I had: they were &s;upported by the acknow|ledged character for genero&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, and &s;till more by HYAT'S apprehen&s;ions of TIPPOO; and they had their effect. That very night he au|thori&s;ed me to go to the Briti&s;h General; and, though he would not commit him&s;elf by &s;ending propo&s;als in writing, he con&s;ented to receive them from the General, and promi&s;ed to wait for my re|turn till day-light the next morning&mdash;adding, that if I did not appear by that time, he would go off with his family and trea&s;ure to &s;ome other place, and &s;et the town, powder-magazine and &s;tore-hou|&s;es on fire, leaving a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed cha|racter to defend the citadel or inner fort, which was &s;trong, with a deep ditch, and mounted with many pieces of cannon, and &s;end immediate intel|ligence to an army of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e and ten thou&s;and infantry, who were at that time on their road from Seringapatam, to ha&s;ten their progre&s;s, and make them advance with all po&s;&s;ible rapidity; and he further ob&s;erved, that as TIPPOO him&s;elf would come to the immediate protection of his country, and, if once come while the Engli&s;h ar|my remained in the open field, would give them cau&s;e to repent their temerity, there was no time to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Accompanied by a per&s;on who had officiated as interpreter between the Jemadar and me, and who&s;e good offices and influence with HYAT, which was very great, I had been previou&s;ly lucky enough to &s;ecure, I &s;et off at ten o'clock at night, on hor&s;eback to the Briti&s;h army. My companion was in high &s;pirits when we fir&s;t &s;et out from the fort; but as we proceeded, he expre&s;&s;ed great ap|prehen&s;ion of being &s;hot in approaching the camp,
<PB N="351" REF="033487_0350_0FF725B486AFCEA8">
and earne&s;tly entreated me to &s;leep at a choreltry, which lay in our way, till morning. His terror mu&s;t have been great indeed, to induce him to make &s;uch a propo&s;al, as he knew very well that we had pledged our&s;elves to be back before dawn next day. I rallied him upon his fears, and en|deavoured to per&s;uade him there was not the &s;mall|e&s;t danger, as I knew how to an&s;wer the outpo&s;ts, when they &s;hould challenge us, in &s;uch a manner as to prevent their firing. As we advanced to the camp, however, his trepidation increa&s;ed; and when we approached the &s;entries, I was obliged to drag him along by force. Then his fears had very nearly produced the danger he dreaded, (the almo&s;t invariable effect of cowardice); for the &s;entry next to us, hearing the ru&s;tling noi&s;e, let off his piece, and was retreating when I had the good fortune to make him hear me. My companion, alarmed at the noi&s;e of the mu&s;quet, fell down in a paroxy&s;m of terror, from which it was &s;ome time before he was completely recovered. The &s;entry who had fired, coming up, conducted us to a place where other &s;entries were po&s;ted, one of whom accompa|nied us to a guard, from whence we were brought to the grand guard, and by them conducted to the General.</P>

the bare ground in a choreltry. His duba&s;h, who&s;e name was SNAKE, recollected me immediately, and was almo&s;t as much frightened at my appearance at fir&s;t, as my interpreter companion was at the &s;hot of the &s;entry; for it was full five months &s;ince my hair and beard were both &s;haved at the &s;ame time, during which period a comb had never touched my head: I had no hat&mdash;no &s;tockings&mdash;was clad in a pair of very ragged breeches, a &s;hirt which was &s;o full of holes that it re&s;embled rather a net than a web of cloth, and a wai&s;tcoat which had been made for a man twice my &s;ize&mdash;while my feet were de|fended from the &s;tones only by a pair of Indian &s;lippers. SNAKE, as &s;oon as he was able to con|quer his terror, and &s;top the loquacious effu&s;ions of a&s;toni&s;hment, brought me to the General, whom I found fa&s;t a&s;leep.

<P>Having &s;tated to the General the nature and ob|ject of my mi&s;&s;ion, and related to him what had happened in the fort, he in&s;tantly &s;aw the great advantages that mu&s;t accrue from &s;uch an arrange|ment&mdash;entered into a full but &s;hort di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;&s;ettled with me the plan to be pur|&s;ued in either ca&s;e of HYAT SAHIB'S acceding to or di&s;&s;enting from the terms he propo&s;ed to offer; and in le&s;s than an hour after my arrival, I was di&s;|patched back to the fort in the General's palan|quin, with a cowl from him, &s;ignifying that the Jemadar HYAT SAHIB'S power and influence &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened, if he &s;hould quietly &s;ur|render up the fort. Before my departure, the General expre&s;&s;ed, in the warme&s;t terms, his ap|probation of my conduct; and added that con&s;ider|ing the importance of the fort, the exten&s;ive in|fluence
<PB N="353" REF="033487_0352_0FF725BA1179E080">
of HYAT SAHIB, and the advantages that might be derived from his experience and abilities, coupled with the enfeebled &s;tate of his army, the benefits of &s;uch a negociation &s;carcely admitted of calculation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the very flattering circum&s;tan|ces with which my pre&s;ent pur&s;uit was attended, I could not help, as I returned to Hydernagur, find|ing &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, ari&s;ing from the imme|diate nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and from my know|ledge of the faithle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition of A&s;iatics, and the little difficulty they find in violating any moral principle, if it happens to cla&s;h with their intere&s;t, or if a breach of it promi&s;es any advantage. I con|&s;idered that it was by no means impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome re&s;olution adver&s;e to my project might have been adopted in my ab&s;ence, and that the Jemadar's policy might lead him to make my de&s;truction a &s;ort of propitiation for his former offences, and to &s;end me and the cowl together to TIPPOO, to be &s;acrificed to his re&s;entment. The&s;e thoughts, I own, made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind&mdash; but were again effaced by the reflection, that a laud|able mea&s;ure, once begun, ought to be per&s;evered in, and that the accompli&s;hing a plan of &s;uch im|portance and incalculable public utility, might operate &s;till further by example, and produce con|&s;equences of which it was impo&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent to form a conception. Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and a variety of &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions, entirely overcame the &s;cruples and fears of the danger; and I once more entered the fort of Hydernagur. At this time the Briti&s;h troops were, by detaching a part with Colonel MACLEOD, to get round the fort, and attack it in the rear, and, by death and &s;ickne&s;s, reduced to le&s;s than four hundred Europeans and &s;even hun|dred Sepoys, without ordnance.</P>
<P>When I delivered the cowl to the Jemadar, he read it, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed, but talked of four or

five days to con&s;ider of an an&s;wer, and &s;eemed to be wavering in his mind, and labouring under the alternate impul&s;es of oppo&s;ite motives and contra|dictory pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;aw that it was a cri&s;is of more importance than any other of my life&mdash;a cri&s;is in which delay, irre&s;olution, or yielding to the pro|tractive expedients of HYAT, might be fatal. To prevent, therefore, the effects of either treachery or repentance, I took advantage of the general confu&s;ion and trepidation which prevailed in the fort&mdash;collected the Arcot Sepoys, who, to the number of four hundred, were pri&s;oners at large&mdash; po&s;ted them at the gates, powder-magazines, and other critical &s;ituations; and, having taken the&s;e and other precautions, went out to the General, who, according to the plan concerted between us, had pu&s;hed on with the advanced guard; and, con|ducting him into the fort with hardly an attendant, brought him &s;traight to the Jemadar's pre&s;ence while he yet remained in a &s;tate of indeci&s;ion and terror. General MATHEWS, in his fir&s;t interview with the Jemadar, did every thing to re-a&s;&s;ure him, and confirmed with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations the terms of the cowl; in con&s;equence of which the latter acceded to the propo&s;itions contained in it, and the Briti&s;h colours for the fir&s;t time waved upon the walls of the chief fort of the country of Bidanore.</P>
<P>Having thus contributed to put this important garri&s;on, with all its trea&s;ures, which certainly were immen&s;e, into the hands of the Company, without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle man, or even the &s;trik|ing of a &s;ingle blow, my exultation was incon|ceivable; and, much though I wanted money, I can with truth aver, that avarice had not even for an in&s;tant the lea&s;t &s;hare in my &s;en&s;ations. 'Tis true, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my &s;ervices a&s;&s;ured me of a reward; but how that reward was to accrue to me, never once was the &s;ubject of my contem|plation
<PB N="355" REF="033487_0354_0FF725BE5ABA50D0">
&mdash;much le&s;s did I think of availing my&s;elf of the in&s;tant occa&s;ion to obtain it. How far my delicacy on the occa&s;ion may be cen&s;ured or appro|ved, I cannot tell; but if I got nothing by it, I have at lea&s;t the con&s;olation to reflect that I e&s;caped calumny, which was with a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable and un&s;paring hand lavi&s;hed on others. The General, it is true, promi&s;ed that I &s;hould remain with him till he made &s;ome arrangements; and HYAT SA|HIB offered, on his part, to make me, through the General, a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent. The General, however, &s;uddenly became di&s;&s;atisfied with me; and I neither got HYAT SAHIB'S pre&s;ent, nor ever received even a rupee of the va&s;t &s;poil found there.</P>
<P>Here I think it a duty incumbent on me to &s;ay &s;omething of General MATHEWS, and, while I de|plore the unfortunate turn in his temper, which injured me, and tarni&s;hed in &s;ome mea&s;ure his good qualities, to re&s;cue him from that unremitted oblo|quy which the ignorant, the intere&s;ted and the en|vious have thrown upon his fame. Light lie the a&s;hes of the dead, and hallowed be the turf that pillows the head of a &s;oldier! General MATHEWS was indeed a &s;oldier&mdash;was calumniated too; and although he did not u&s;e me as I had rea&s;on to hope he would, I will, as far as I can, re&s;cue his fame from gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>An extravagant love of fame was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of General MATHEWS: it was the great end of all his pur&s;uits; and while, in his military profe&s;&s;ion, he walked with a firm pace towards it, he lo&s;t his time, di&s;torted his progre&s;s, and pal&s;ied his own efforts, by a jealous vigilance and envious oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e whom he found taking the &s;ame road, whether they walked be&s;ide him, or panted in feeble effort behind. This was his fault; it was doubtle&s;s a great alloy to his good qualities: but it has been puni&s;hed with rigour di&s;proportion|ate

to the offence. Tho&s;e who per&s;onally felt his jealou&s;y, took advantage of his melancholy end to traduce him, and magnify every mole-hill of error into a mountain of crime. It is unmanly in any one&mdash;indeed it is&mdash;to traduce the &s;oldier who has fallen in the &s;ervice of his country; but it is here|&s;y in a &s;oldier to do &s;o. No &s;ooner did the buzz of calumny get abroad, than thou&s;ands of hornets, who had neither intere&s;t nor concern in the affair, joined in it. The malignant, who wi&s;hed to &s;ting merely to get rid of &s;o much of their venom&mdash;and the vain, who wi&s;hed to acquire a reputation for knowledge of A&s;iatic affairs at the expence of truth &mdash;united together, and rai&s;ed a hum which reach|ed Europe, where the hornets (I mean authors), under the le&s;s unju&s;tifiable impul&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, took it up, and buzzed through the medium of <HI>quartos</HI> and <HI>octavos</HI> &s;o loud, that public opinion was poi&s;oned; and the gallant &s;oldier who, for the ad|vantage of England, &s;tood the harde&s;t tugs of war, and at la&s;t drank the poi&s;oned cup from the tyrant hands of her enemy, was generally under&s;tood to be a peculator, and to have clande&s;tinely and di&s;|hone&s;tly obtained three hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>On this attention I put my direct negative. It may be &s;aid, however, that this is only a&s;&s;ertion again&s;t a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;True! Sorry &s;hould I be to re&s;t it there: my a&s;&s;ertions are grounded on &s;uch proofs as are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be &s;haken&mdash;proofs on record in the office of the Pre&s;idency of Bombay.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Hydernagur was taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, HYAT SAHIB immediately i&s;&s;ued orders to the &s;orts of Mangatore, Deokull, Ananpore, and &s;ome others in that country, to &s;urrender to the Briti&s;h arms. Some obeyed the mandate; but tho&s;e three re&s;i&s;ted, and were reduced by General MATHEWS. Ren|dered incautious by &s;ucce&s;s, our army became le&s;s vigilant, and TIPPOO retook Hydernagur; and, in direct breach of the capitulation, made the gar|ri&s;on

pri&s;oners, treated them with a degree of in|humanity which chills the blood even to think of, and forced General MATHEWS to take poi&s;on in pri&s;on!</P>
<P>Mean-time HYAT SAHIB, with whom the Ge|neral had got into di&s;putes, arrived at Bombay, and laid a charge again&s;t him, which he, being in the hands of TIPPOO, could not controvert, or even know. And what was the charge? The whole extent of it was his (MATHEWS'S) having got two lacks of rupees, and a pearl necklace, as a pre&s;ent &mdash;a &s;um, con&s;idering the country and circum&s;tan|&s;tances, not at all extraordinary, but which is com|pletely vindicated by the General's letter to the Court of Directors, dated at Mangalore, the 15th of March, 1783; in which he &s;tates the pre&s;ent, and reque&s;ts permi&s;&s;ion to accept it. This, as I &s;aid before, is on record, and was tran&s;lated by Mr. SYBBALD, who was then Per&s;ian interpreter at Bombay. The letter I allude to, you will &s;ee in the APPENDIX. In &s;hort, General MATHEWS had his faults, but an unju&s;t avarice was not a|mong&s;t them.</P>

<P>HAVING, in my la&s;t letter, &s;aid as much as I thought ju&s;tice demanded in defence of Gen|eral MATHEWS, again&s;t the charge of peculation, I am now to &s;peak of him as his conduct touched me. He was, as I have already mentioned, an old friend of my father's, and an intimate of my own: I had rea&s;on, therefore, to expect from him, according to the u&s;ual di&s;po&s;itions and manners of men, if not partiality, at lea&s;t friend&s;hip; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e as
<PB N="358" REF="033487_0357_0FF725C66A771FD0">
I have related, where my &s;ervices gave me a claim to notice, it was not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he would have been forward to promote my inter|e&s;t, by &s;tating my &s;ervices in &s;uch a manner as to call attention to them. He had, however, &s;ome di&s;a|greeable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with his officers; and &s;eeing I was on a footing with Colonel HUMBERTSON, and &s;till more with Major CAMPBELL (he who &s;o ably and gallantly defended Mangalore again&s;t TIPPOO'S whole army and &s;ix hundred French), and finding me extremely zealous and importunate to have his arrangement with HYAT SAHIB adhered to, he be|came di&s;plea&s;ed, and, though he him&s;elf had deter|mined that I &s;hould remain with him, changed his mind, and ordered me away at an hour's notice&mdash; many days &s;ooner than he had originally intended to &s;end off any di&s;patches. He moreover occa&s;ion|ed my lo&s;ing a &s;um of money, and on the whole paid le&s;s attention to my intere&s;t than the circum|&s;tances of the ca&s;e demanded.</P>
<P>In the evening of the day on which he determi|ned on my departure, I &s;et off with his di&s;patches to the governments of Madra&s;s and Bengal, and reached the mo&s;t di&s;tant of our po&s;ts that night. From thence I had thirty miles to Cundapore, a &s;ea|port town upon the Malabar coa&s;t, taken by us from the enemy. During this journey, which was through the country of TIPPOO SAHIB, I had on|ly &s;ix Sepoys to conduct me: yet, &s;uch was the univer&s;al panic that had &s;eized all cla&s;&s;es and di&s;|tinctions of people at the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in that quarter, I met only a few &s;cattered Sepoys, who were &s;o badly wounded I pre&s;ume they were unable to travel&mdash;the villages through|out being completely abandoned by all their inha|bitants.</P>

At length, with great difficulty, I reached Cundapore, where the commanding officer, and all about him did every thing in their power to afford me a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort under my mi&s;eries, which increa&s;ed every hour rapidly. I felt as if my in&s;ide was utterly decayed, and all its functions lo&s;t in de|bility: at the &s;ame time my head &s;eemed deranged &mdash;I could &s;carcely comprehend the meaning of what was &s;aid; lifting up my head was attended with agonizing pain; and if I had any power of thought, it was to con&s;ider my&s;elf as approaching fa&s;t to di&s;&s;olution. I had the &s;en&s;e, however, to &s;end to General MATHEWS, to acquaint him with my indi&s;po&s;ition, and utter inability to pro|ceed with his di&s;patches. To this I received the following letter:</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="360" REF="033487_0359_0FF725CE924696C0">The receipt of this letter induced me, bad as I was, to make one other exertion; and I re&s;olved, though I &s;hould die on the way, not to leave any thing which, even by malicious con&s;truction, could be made a &s;et-off again&s;t my claims: I therefore hired an open boat to carry me along the coa&s;t to Anjengo, and &s;et out with every pro&s;pect of hav|ing the virulence of my di&s;order increa&s;ed, by be|ing expo&s;ed in an uncovered ve&s;&s;el to the damp of the night air, and the raging heat of the &s;un in the day, and of being arre&s;ted by the hand of death in my way. By the time I had got down the coa&s;t as far as Mangalore, my complaints increa&s;ed to an alarming height; and I became &s;peechle&s;s, and un|able to &s;tand. Fortunately there happened to be a Company's ve&s;&s;el then lying at anchor off that place, the captain of which had the goodne&s;s to in|vite me to remain on board with him, &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;ing that I &s;hould give up the thoughts of pro|ceeding immediately on my voyage to Anjengo, which I could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive, and to forward my di&s;patches by another hand. The &s;urgeon of the &s;hip joining the captain in opinion that I could not &s;urvive if I attempted it, and my own judg|ment coinciding with their's, I at length con&s;en|ted, and remained there.</P>
<P>Tranquility, kind treatment, and good medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, produced, in the &s;pace of two or three weeks, &s;o material a change in my health, I was in a condition to avail my&s;elf, at the expiration of that time, of a &s;hip bound to Anjengo, and which offering the additional inducement of touching at Tellicherry, determined me to take my pa&s;&s;age in her. When I arrived at Tellicherry, and during my &s;tay there, the great attention &s;hewn me by Mr. FREEMAN, the chief of that place, and the comforts of his hou&s;e, re&s;tored me to a great &s;hare of health and &s;pirits&mdash;And here a very &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance occurred.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="033487_0360_0FF725D0229EC330">One day a ve&s;&s;el arrived; and perceiving a boat coming on &s;hore from her, Mr. FREEMAN and I walked down to the beach, to make the u&s;ual in|quiries&mdash;&s;uch as, where &s;he came from? what news &s;he brought? <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> As &s;oon as the boat touched the &s;hore, a gentleman leaped out of it, who&s;e per&s;on &s;eemed familiar to me: upon his nearer approach, I di&s;covered that it was Mr. BRODEY, a gentleman who had been kind enough to take upon him the office of my attorney, upon my leaving India &s;ome years before&mdash;not my <HI>attor|ney</HI> in the ordinary acceptation of that word, but a liberal and di&s;intere&s;ted friend, who obligingly un|dertook the management of my affairs in my ab|&s;ence, without the &s;malle&s;t hope of advantage, or rather under circum&s;tances which &s;erved as pre|ludes to further obligations. I was certainly plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him; but his a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee me amounted almo&s;t to a di&s;tru&s;t of his eye|&s;ight: he had received &s;uch indubitable proofs of my death, that my &s;udden appearance on his land|ing, at the fir&s;t ru&s;h of thought, impre&s;&s;ed him with the notion of a <HI>deceptio vi&s;us.</HI> My identity, however, was too po&s;itive for re&s;i&s;tance; and his wonder melted down into cordial &s;atisfaction, and congratulations on my &s;afety. He then took out a pocket account-book, in which, for &s;ecurity again&s;t accidents, he kept accounts-current, written in a brief manner&mdash;and &s;hewed me mine, &s;ettled al|mo&s;t to the very day, upon which was tran&s;cribed a copy of a letter he had received, and which he thought was a te&s;timony of my death. So, cutting out the account, and pre&s;enting it to me, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t cordial and hand&s;ome manner, his joy that it was into my own hands he had at la&s;t had an opportunity to deliver it. This gentleman is now in this Kingdom, and too well known for me to de&s;cribe him. Suffice it to &s;ay, that in En|gland, as well as in India, he has always enjoyed
<PB N="362" REF="033487_0361_0FF725D378AA7C28">
the e&s;teem and re&s;pect of all his acquaintances, to as great an extent as any other per&s;on I know.</P>
<P>I again embarked to proceed on my voyage, and had hardly got on board when a &s;hip dropped an|chor along &s;ide of us, in which captain CAMPBELL of Comby, a very near connection of mine, was pa&s;&s;enger. On hailing one another, he heard that I was on board, and immeditely was with me. Tho&s;e who &s;incerely love each other, and who&s;e hearts confe&s;s the fond ties of con&s;anguinity, can alone conceive what our mutual plea&s;ure was at meeting &s;o unexpectedly in &s;o remote a corner of the world. He was then on his way to join the army. This amiable young man, now repo&s;es in the bed of honour at Mangalore! He fell, after having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the very gallant defence made by that place again&s;t the whole force of TIPPOO. With regret we parted: and in due time I arrived at Anjengo without any accident befalling me, which was rather extraordinary.</P>
<P>Leaving Anjengo, I &s;et out for Madras, de&s;ign|ing to go all the way by land&mdash;a journey of near eight hundred miles. I accordingly &s;truck through the Kingdom of Travancore, who&s;e &s;overeign is in alliance with the Engli&s;h; and had not long entered the territories of the Nabob of Arcot, be|fore Major MACNEAL, an old friend of mine, and commandant of a fort in that di&s;trict, met me preceded by a troop of dancing girls, who encir|cled my palanquin, dancing around me until I entered the Major's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to give you an adequate notion of tho&s;e dancing girls. Trained up from their infancy to the practice of the mo&s;t graceful motions, the mo&s;t artful di&s;play of per&s;onal &s;ym|metry, and the mo&s;t wanton allurements, they dance in &s;uch a &s;tyle, and twine their limbs and bodies into &s;uch po&s;tures, as bewitch the &s;en&s;es, and extort applau&s;e and admiration where in &s;trict|ne&s;s
<PB N="363" REF="033487_0362_0FF725D7079329C8">
di&s;approbation is due: nor is their agility in|ferior to the grace of their movements&mdash;though they do not exert it in the &s;ame &s;kipping way that our &s;tage dancers do, but make it &s;ub&s;ervient to the elegance, and, I may &s;ay, grandeur, of their air. They are generally found in troops of &s;ix or eight, attended by mu&s;icians, who&s;e a&s;pect and dre&s;s are as uncouth and &s;qualid, as the &s;ounds they produce under the name of mu&s;ic, are inelegant, har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant. To this mu&s;ic, from which mea&s;ure as much as harmony is excluded, they dance, mo&s;t wonderfully adapting their &s;tep to the perpetual change of the time, accompanying it with amorous &s;ongs, while the corre&s;pondent action of their body and limbs, the wanton palpitation and heaving of their exqui&s;itely formed bo&s;oms, and the amorous, or rather la&s;civious expre&s;&s;ion of their countenance, excite in the &s;pectators emotions not very favourable to cha&s;tity. Thus they con|tinue to act, till, by the warmth of exerci&s;e and imagination, they become &s;eemingly frantic with ec&s;tacy, and, &s;inking down motionle&s;s with fatigue, throw them&s;elves into the mo&s;t alluring attitudes that ingenious vice and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e.</P>
<P>That &s;uch incitements to vice &s;hould make a part of the &s;y&s;tem of any &s;ociety, is to be lament|ed: yet, at all ceremonies and great occa&s;ions, whe|ther of religious wor&s;hip or dome&s;tic enjoyment, they make a part of the entertainment; and the altar of their gods, and the purity of the marriage rites, are alike polluted by the introduction of the dancing girls. The impurity of this cu&s;tom, how|ever, vani&s;hes in India, when compared with the hideous practice of introducing dancing <HI>boys.</HI></P>
<P>The Major, after having entertained me in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner, accompanied me to Palam|cotah, to the hou&s;e of Doctor DOTT, who lived in a generous and ho&s;pitable &s;tyle. I had once had
<PB N="364" REF="033487_0363_0FF725D9A9299CE8">
an opportunity of evincing my good di&s;po&s;ition to this gentleman, when he was mo&s;t critically &s;itu|ated; and the reception he gave me demon&s;trated, that he than retained a lively &s;en&s;e of my conduct to him.</P>
<P>Leaving Palamcotah, I continued my route thro' Madura. This country is rendered remarkable by the revolt of the famous ISIF CAWN, who made a bold and well-conducted attempt to erect him&s;elf into the &s;overeignty of that province, independent of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in who&s;e &s;ervice he was: and as the affair occurs to my thoughts, I will, for your information, notwith&s;tanding its being unconnected with my &s;tory, digre&s;s into an account of it. As &s;oon as the revolt of ISIF CAWN was known, General MONSON, an officer of great military &s;kill and per&s;onal merit, went again&s;t him at the head of the King's and com|pany's troops, and inve&s;ted the &s;ort of Madura, in which that rebellious chief was po&s;ted. The general made a practicable breach, and, in &s;torm|ing, was beat back with great &s;laughter by ISIF; and the &s;etting in of the mon&s;oons immediately after, retarded the further operations of our army again&s;t the place; and in the interim, peace hav|ing been concluded between the courts of St. James's and Ver&s;ailles, the King's troops were withdrawn.</P>
<P>On the recall of the King's troops, an army of company's troops was formed, to proceed again&s;t Madura, in order to reduce this gallant turbulent rebel to &s;ubjection; and the renowned general LAWRENCE being rendered incapable of actual &s;ervice, and obliged to remain at the pre&s;idency by extreme age and infirmity, the chief command de|volved upon my father by &s;eniority: he headed the expedition; and, after overcoming innumerable difficulties thrown in his way by the inventive genius and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of ISIF CAWN, again

made a breach, which was deemed practicable by the chief engineer, now Sir JOHN CALL. An a&s;&s;ault was made with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former; for our army was again repul&s;ed with in|credible &s;laughter: more than two thirds, I believe, of our European officers, were among the killed or wounded; and the death o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Major PRESTON, &s;econd in command, a man endeared to the a my by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every advantage of per&s;on, heart and talents&mdash;an active, intrepid and able offi|cer&mdash;aggravated the calami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of the day.</P>

<P>The peculiar &s;tyle of this letter made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my memory, that I am able to give the exact words.

The re&s;ult was an&s;werable to his expectations; for the young man's conduct, both as an officer and a gentleman, was &s;uch in the &s;equel as to reflect credit on him|&s;elf and his family; and his very honourable and hopeful career was at la&s;t terminated by a cannon-ball at the &s;iege of Tanjore.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<P>PASSING through Madura, I arrived at Trichinopoly, where I met Mr. SULLIVAN, the re&s;ident of Tanjore, who very politely furni&s;hed me with a letter to Mr. HIPPESLEY, his deputy at Tanjore, from whom I received many marks of civility. At that place I had the plea&s;ure of meet|ing a gentleman with whom I had been at college, and for whom I had always entertained a great e&s;teem: this was Colonel FULLARTON. It is an old maxim, that we &s;hould &s;ay nothing but good of the dead&mdash;"De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum." It is not a new maxim, I believe, to avoid prai&s;ing the living: I am aware of the indelicacy of it; and therefore purpo&s;ely avoid in this, as I &s;hall in other in&s;tances, &s;peaking the full opinion I entertain&punc; To the general e&s;teem in which he was held by all ranks of people in India, I refer you to Colonel FULLARTON'S character: it is of &s;uch a &s;ort, that I wi&s;h to hold it up for your imitation. At a time of life when others have arrived to &s;ome perfection in their profe&s;&s;ion, he made choice of his, and en|tered for the fir&s;t time into the arduous military de|partment, with a command for which the training of many years is no more than &s;ufficient to prepare other men. The Mini&s;ter of that day gave him this important charge, underwent the clamours of
<PB N="370" REF="033487_0369_0FF7261CA7864940">
Oppo&s;ition for it, and was ju&s;tified in the event. When the Colonel came to act, &s;o far from be|ing deficient, his whole conduct was di&s;tingui&s;hed, not le&s;s for military talent than courage&mdash;while the mo&s;t fortunate command and temper and captiva|ting addre&s;s &s;ubdued the &s;pirit of prejudice, recon|ciled the mo&s;t di&s;cordant, and gained him, though a King's Officer, the e&s;teem as much of the Com|pany's as King's troops. In &s;hort, all ranks of people, civil as well as military, whether belong|ing to King or Company, united in approbation of his conduct&mdash;a thing not before, nor &s;ince, but in the per&s;on of LORD CORNWALLIS.</P>
<P>Too m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> cannot be &s;aid of the advantages re|&s;ulting from a proper command of temper. To promote that in my FEDERICK, will be attended with little difficulty: on the contrary, my only doubt is, that the placability and mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition will too often &s;ubject him to impo&s;ition. JOHN is, however, of a different temper; there is &s;omething in it which requires both admonition and good example to repre&s;s within proper bounds: to &s;hew him the beauty as well as u&s;e of a mild, cool temper, &s;uch in&s;tances as Colonel FULLAR|TON may be of weight, and I wi&s;h him to reflect upon it. And here I am reminded of a per&s;on and a circum&s;tance &s;o exactly in point, that I cannot refrain from noticing them: they convey no inade|quate idea of the happine&s;s re&s;ulting from a gentle|ne&s;s of nature, and dominion over the mind; and as the per&s;on I allude to is dead, I may &s;peak of him with the greater freedom in that full &s;train of prai&s;e of which his &s;hining virtues de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Of all the men I have ever had the good fortune to know, Sir ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the highe&s;t degree, that heavenly turn of mind, which not only is at peace with it&s;elf, but diffu&s;es harmony and cheerfulne&s;s around it.

<P>An incident that occured in my pre&s;ence may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to decipher the mind of this admirable man&mdash;I &s;hall never forget it. Previou&s;ly to his going to India, he had exerted his intere&s;t to obtain from the Ea&s;t India Company &s;ome re|ward for my &s;ervices; and, a few days before his departure, promi&s;ed to &s;peak again to Mr. DE|VAYNES, Chairman of the Ea&s;t India Company. I waited on him on the day he was &s;etting off: he was ju&s;t about to depart, and &s;urrounded by a nu|merous circle. In the mid&s;t of this bu&s;tle, and the confu&s;ion, one would &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;eparable from &s;uch a cri&s;is, he recollected his promi&s;e&mdash;told me Mr. DEVAYNES had that minute taken leave of him, and he had forgot to mention me, but &s;aid that he would write to him on the &s;ubject: and, though he was at the in&s;tant on the point of mo|ving to the carriage that was to carry him off, &s;at down, and with that amiable &s;weetne&s;s of manners and happily collected mind &s;o peculiarly his own,

<P>I had the honour to write to your lord&s;hip on the 8th by Captain HALLAM, who carried from hence very large packets to you. The opportu|nity of Captain CAMPBELL tempts me to trou|ble your lord&s;hip, merely to inform you, that all my letters from Bidanore a&s;cribe in a great degree the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms in that quarter, and the <HI>romantic</HI> Revolution effected there, to the influence he had with HYAT SAHIB, and to the propo&s;als of &s;urrender which he &s;ugge&s;t|ed, and tran&s;acted with the General and Jema|dar. I think it nece&s;&s;ary that you, my lord, may know how much the Public is indebted to Captain CAMPBELL, who&s;e good fortune in this affair has only been equalled by his good conduct. He is perfectly acquainted with the &s;tate of af|fairs on the other coa&s;t, and has &s;een and heard much of our tran&s;actions here; &s;o that no per&s;on can give a more clear or unbia&s;&s;ed view of events.</P>

<P>I had al&s;o the good luck to meet, at Tanjore, Mr. BUCHANAN, a very near connection of mine, for whom I had long entertained a &s;incere and warm regard. It has been my misfortune to have been obliged frequently to cen&s;ure &s;ome of my re|latives for ill-nature and ingratitude: I never did

&s;o without the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations. When, on the contrary, I am enabled to &s;peak to their honour, I feel a proportionate &s;hare of plea&s;ure: I am therefore happy in mentioning Mr. BUCHAN|AN as a man as amiable in his private as re&s;pectable in his public character; but the &s;atisfaction I felt at this meeting was much alloyed by finding him in a very bad &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Before I left Tanjore, I had an opportunity of being eye-witne&s;s to that extraordinary and horrid ceremony, the burring of a Gentoo woman with the body of her hu&s;band.

<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Ceremony of the Gentoo Women burning them&s;elves with the bodies of their Hu&s;bands.</HEAD>
<P>"This day, &mdash;, I went to &s;ee a Gentoo woman re&s;ign her&s;elf to be burned along with the corp&s;e of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band.</P>
<P>"The place fixed upon for this tragic &s;cene, was a &s;mall i&s;let on the bank of one of the branches of the river Cavery, about a mile to the Northward of the fort of Tanjore.</P>
<P>"When I came to the &s;pot, I found the victim, who appeared to be not above &s;ixteen, &s;itting on the ground, dre&s;&s;ed in the Gentoo manner, with a white cloth wrapped round her, &s;ome white flowers like je&s;&s;amins hanging round her neck, and &s;ome of them hanging from her hair. There were about twenty women &s;itting on their hams round her, holding a white handkerchief, extended hori|zontally over her head, to &s;hade her from the &s;un, which was exce&s;&s;ively hot, it being then about noon.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="033487_0374_0FF725F2ADA345F8">"At about twenty yards from where &s;he was &s;it|ting, and facing her, there were &s;everal Bramins bu&s;y in con&s;tructing a pile with billets of fire|wood: the pile was about eight feet long, and four broad. They fir&s;t began by driving &s;ome upright &s;takes into the ground, and then built up the middle to about the height of three feet and a half with billets of wood.</P>
<P>"The dead hu&s;band, who, from his appearance, &s;eemed to be about &s;ixty years of age, was lying clo&s;e by, &s;tretched out on a bie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, made of Bamboo canes. Four Bramins walked in proce&s;&s;ion three times round the dead body, fir&s;t in a direction con|trary to the &s;un, and afterwards other three times in a direction with the &s;un, all the while muttering in|cantations; and at each round or circuit they made, they untwi&s;ted, and immediately again twi&s;ted up the &s;mall long lock of hair which is left un&s;haven at the back of their heads.</P>
<P>"Some other Bramins were in the mean time employed in &s;prinkling water out of a green leaf, rolled up like a cup, upon a &s;mall heap of cakes of dry cow-dung, with which the pile was after|wards to be &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>"An old Bramin &s;at at the North-ea&s;t corner of the pile upon his hams, with a pair of &s;pectacles on, reading, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Sha&s;ter, or their Scriptures, from a book compo&s;ed of Cajan leaves.</P>
<P>"Having been pre&s;ent now nearly an hour, I inquired when they meant to &s;et the pile on fire: they an&s;wered, in about two hours. As this &s;pec|tacle was mo&s;t melancholy, and naturally &s;truck me with horror, and as I had only gone there to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of the <HI>truth of &s;uch &s;acrifices being made,</HI> I went away towards the fort. After I was gone about five hundred yards, they &s;ent &s;ome one to tell me they would burn immediately; on which I returned, and found the woman had been moved from where &s;he was &s;itting to the river, where the
<PB N="376" REF="033487_0375_0FF725F43B0D7268">
Bramins were bathing her. On taking her out of the water, they put &s;ome money in her hand, which &s;he dipped in the river, and divided among the Bramins: &s;he had then a yellow cloth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olled par|tially round her. They put &s;ome red colour, about the &s;ize of a &s;ixpence, on the centre of her fore|head, and rubbed &s;omething that appeared to me to be clay. She was then led to the pile, round which &s;he walked three times as the &s;un goes: &s;he then mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nted it at the North-ea&s;t corner, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;at her&s;elf down on the right &s;ide of her hu&s;band, who had been previou&s;ly laid upon the pile. She then un&s;crewed the pins which fa&s;tened the jewels or &s;ilver rings on her arms: after &s;he had taken them off, &s;he &s;hut them, and &s;crewed in the pins again, and gave one to each of two women who were &s;tanding: &s;he un&s;crewed the car-rings, and other toys, with great compo&s;ure, and divided them among the women who were with her. There &s;eemed to be &s;ome little &s;quabble about the di&s;tribution of her jewels, which &s;he &s;ettled with great preci&s;ion; and then, falling gently backwards, polled a fold of the yellow cloth over her face, turned her brea&s;t towards her hu&s;bands &s;ide, and laid her right arm over his brea&s;t; and in this po&s;ture &s;he remained without moving.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t before &s;he lay down, the Bramins put &s;ome rice in her lap, and al&s;o &s;ome in the mouth and on the long grey beard of her hu&s;band: they then &s;prinkled &s;ome water on the head, brea&s;t and feet of both, and tied them gently together round the middle with a &s;lender bit of rope: they then rai&s;ed, as it were, a little wall of wood lengthways on two &s;ides of the pile, &s;o as to rai&s;e it above the level of the bodies; and then put cro&s;s pieces, &s;o as to prevent the billets of wood from pre&s;&s;ing on them: they then poured on the pile, above where the woman lay, a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful of &s;omething that appeared to me to be oil; after this they heaped on more
<PB N="377" REF="033487_0376_0FF725F5CE6CEAB8">
wood, to the height of about four feet above where the bodies were built in; &s;o that all I now &s;aw was a &s;tack of fire-wood.</P>
<P>"One of the Bramins, I ob&s;erved, &s;tood at the end of the pile next the woman's head&mdash;was call|ing to her through the inter&s;tices of the wood, and laughed &s;everal times during the conver&s;ation. La&s;tly, they over&s;pread the pile with wet &s;traw, and tied it on with ropes.</P>
<P>"A Bramin then took a handful of &s;traw, which he &s;et on fire at the little heap of burning cakes of cow-dung; and, &s;tanding to windward of the pile, he let the wind drive the flame from the &s;traw till it catched the pile. Fortunately, at this in&s;tant, the wind ro&s;e much higher than it had been any part of the day; and in an in&s;tant the flames per|vaded the whole pile, and it burnt with great fury. I li&s;tened a few &s;econds, but could not di&s;tingui&s;h any &s;hricks, which might perhaps be owing to my being then to windward. In a very few minutes, the pile became a heap of a&s;hes.</P>
<P>"During the whole time of this proce&s;s, which la&s;ted from fir&s;t to la&s;t above two hours before we lo&s;t &s;ight of the woman by her being built up in the middle of the pile, I kept my eyes almo&s;t con|&s;tantly upon her; and I declare to GOD that I could not perceive, either in her countenance or limbs, the lea&s;t trace of either horror, fear, or even he&s;itation: her countenance was perfectly com|po&s;ed and placed; and &s;he was not, I am po&s;itive, either intoxicated or &s;tupified. From &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances, I thought the Bramins exulted in this helli&s;h &s;acrifice, and did not &s;eem at all di&s;plea&s;ed that Europeans &s;hould be witne&s;&s;es of it."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO every &s;tep of my journey has been marked by occurrences &s;o unexpected, and accidents &s;o extraordinary, that I &s;hould feel &s;ome repugnance to relate them, le&s;t my veracity &s;hould be called in que&s;tion, were they not atte&s;ted by &s;o many living per&s;ons of re&s;pectability, and by writ|ten documents of authority on record. Were one to con&s;ider them merely as the offspring of fiction, they would perhaps have intere&s;t enough to catch the attention; but, viewing them as facts, they borrow, from their number and rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as from their &s;ingularity, &s;o much of the com|plexion of imaginary adventure, that the combina|tion cannot, I think, fail to intere&s;t your mind as well as your feelings.</P>
<P>Arrived at Negapatnam, within a &s;hort run of Madras, it is natural for you to &s;uppo&s;e that adven|ture was at an end, and that fortune, fatigued by the ince&s;&s;ant exertion of her caprice, might have left me to proceed the &s;hort re&s;idue of my way without further mole&s;tation. It fell out other|wi&s;e: &s;he had marked me as her game, and re&s;olved to worry me to the la&s;t moment; for, as we ap|proached Madras, we were cha&s;ed by a French fri|gate, and taken near Fort St. George.</P>
<P>This appeared to me the greate&s;t misfortune I had yet met with, and likely to be the mo&s;t fatal
<PB N="379" REF="033487_0378_0FF725FE02B2F2D0">
in its con&s;equences. In order to explain this, I mu&s;t recur to certain circum&s;tances, which though I was informed of them &s;ince my relea&s;e from Hy|dernagur, I did not relate to you, becau&s;e they were no way connected with my narrative till now.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur SUFFREIN, the French Admiral, hav|ing a number of Briti&s;h pri&s;oners in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whom he found it extremely inconvenient to &s;up|port, made a propo&s;al for an exchange&mdash;which, from &s;ome failure in the conveyance, or ambi|guity in the terms of the corre&s;pondence, was neglected.</P>
<P>The motives or accidents which gave ri&s;e to this neglect have never been completely developed; and perhaps the Admiral him&s;elf, Sir EDWARD HUGHES, and Lord MACARTNEY, were the only per&s;ons who knew the bottom of that tran&s;action. In &s;uch ca&s;es, however, the ignorance of fact is generally &s;upplied by conjecture; and men have pre&s;umed to cen&s;ure unequivocally on the mere hypothetical &s;ugge&s;tions of their own imaginations. Candour, however, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, where it could not &s;peak with certainty, would &s;peak with cau|tion. An Hi&s;torian, particularly, &s;hould &s;teer clear of party rancour, and not &s;uffer the prejudice or malignity which mi&s;led him&s;elf, to go down to and mi&s;lead po&s;terity. Where po&s;itive proof is want|ing, if we are obliged to decide, we mu&s;t judge by analogy and inference; and in the ca&s;e now be|fore us, we have little but the characters of the per&s;ons concerned to guide us in our deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of the horrid cata&s;trophe which &s;ucceeded the neglect of exchanging pri&s;oners, it is hardly po&s;&s;i|ble that any one but Mon&s;ieur SUFFREIN him&s;elf could have had a conception. To &s;uppo&s;e, that, under &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion, our leading men would have he&s;itated to prevent it, would be to &s;uppo&s;e their intellects weak, and their hearts corrupt and inhuman. I fancy it will be difficult to fa&s;ten on
<PB N="380" REF="033487_0379_0FF725FF8F0A1CE8">
Lord MACARTNEY either the one or the other; for he was wi&s;e and humane: tho&s;e whom the di&s;|appointment of unrea&s;onable expectations, or the malevolence of party, have induced to &s;u&s;pect his Lord&s;hip's heart, have been forced by his conduct to revere his talents; and the breath of calumny has never touched the humanity of Sir EDWARD HUGHES. Whatever their motives, therefore, may have been&mdash;rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and candour, mu&s;t acquit them of the con&s;equences. It &s;hould be recollected, too, that Mon&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur SUFFREIN'S cha|racter was a very probable &s;ecurity, in the mind of men of &s;en&s;e and honour, again&s;t any act of horrid inhumanity: his conduct as an officer had made a new aera in the Naval Hi&s;tory of France: his ta|lents and courage might be compared, without di&s;|advantage, to tho&s;e of the be&s;t of our Briti&s;h Ad|mirals; and he had exhibited marks of uncommon genero&s;ity to tho&s;e whom the chance of war had thrown into his hands. It would therefore have been &s;omething more than pre&s;cience to have pre|&s;uppo&s;ed what actually happened; and I declare mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that the inference I draw from the whole information I have had on the &s;ubject is, that, calamitous though the event was, it attaches no po&s;itive guilt on any of the parties concerned. The fact is plainly this: The French Admiral ha|ving no place on the coa&s;t where he could &s;ecure his pri&s;oners, and grieving, as he him&s;elf &s;ub&s;e|quently wrote to Mr. HASTINGS, to &s;ee the un|happy men, who had been &s;ix or &s;even months at &s;ea, dying of the &s;curvy, delivered over the pri|&s;oners, to the number of above three hundred, to HYDER. Their fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e afterwards was &s;uch as it would har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up your &s;oul to hear related.</P>
<P>Take the whole of the circum&s;tances into one glance, and &s;ee what my feelings mu&s;t have been on finding my&s;elf once more a pri&s;oner. HYDER ALLI, who was, when compared with the wor&s;t de&s;|pots
<PB N="381" REF="033487_0380_0FF726022A657848">
of the European world, a mon&s;ter, mu&s;t yet be con&s;idered, when put in compari&s;on, with his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or TIPPOO, mild and merciful. HYDER, from policy and hypocri&s;y, &s;hewed &s;ome lenity to the pri&s;oners who fell into his hands. In&s;tances are known where Briti&s;h captives have broke through the crowd that &s;urrounded him into his pre&s;ence for protection&mdash;when he has hypocritically feigned anger, threatened the per&s;ons who had treated them ill, reprobated &s;everity, and &s;ent them off &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent. TIPPOO, on the contrary, was &s;o perfectly &s;avage, that cruelty &s;eemed to be, not only the internal habit of his &s;oul, but the guide of all his actions, the moving principle of his policy, the rule of his public conduct, and the &s;ource of his private gratification. Like the tyger which, BUFFON tells us, kills the whole flock before he begins to feed, every appetite of his yielded to the more urgent calls of barbarity; and while one drop blood of remained un&s;pilled, one agony uninflicted, one tear un&s;hed, the natural appetites of TIPPOO &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, and the luxuries of life courted his enjoyment in vain. Like the hyena which THOMPSON calls the felle&s;t of the fell, the fury of his nature was neither to be controuled by re&s;i&s;t|ance, nor a&s;&s;uaged by blandi&s;hments. Aloof from the general order of the workings of Providence, he &s;tands a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which the Omnipo|tent has pre&s;ented a glowing living picture, ALL SHADE: not one ray breaks in, to relieve the glo|my a&s;pect of the piece; but, di&s;tinct from the whole human race, of him alone it may be &s;aid, that he never yet di&s;olo&s;ed, even for a moment, one &s;park of virtue.</P>
<P>From barbarity &s;o inflexible to tho&s;e taken in the ordinary chance of war, what could I expect if I fell again into his hands&mdash;I who had been the in|&s;trument of one of his chief Governor's defection &mdash;who had, by my negociations, contributed to
<PB N="382" REF="033487_0381_0FF726041DA58DC8">
deprive him of a Province, and, what perhaps might have had greater weight with him, robbed him of the gratification of a long harboured revenge, by putting his enemy HYAT SAHIB under the protec|tion of the Company? Diabolical vengeance never perhaps met with a &s;ubject of &s;uch &s;ublime enjoy|ment, as the torturing of me would have been to this mon&s;ter. Couple this then, my FREDERICK, with the fears of SUFFREIN'S doing by me as he had already done by the other Engli&s;h pri&s;oners&mdash; and gue&s;s what my terror and con&s;ternation mu&s;t have been at falling into the hands of the French!</P>
<P>Having &s;truck our colours to the French frigate, the Captain ordered us to follow her, and &s;teered to the northward. We obeyed him for &s;ome time: at length night fell; and, a fre&s;h and favourable breeze fortunately aiding the attempt, we put about, ran for Madras, and luckily dropt anchor &s;afely in the roads. In the e&s;capes I had hitherto had, there was always &s;ome di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tance to alloy the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from them&mdash;In this in&s;tance, my joy was pure and unqualified; and I looked forward with a rea&s;onable hope that the wor&s;t was all over.</P>
<P>Here I found Lord MACARTNEY governor, &s;truggling to &s;upport the credit of the Company, and directing their affairs through &s;uch embarra&s;&s;|ments and difficulties as made the mo&s;t wi&s;e and temperate de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. So arduous an un|dertaking as the government of Madras then was, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely occurred: and a more &s;ucce&s;sful final ac|compli&s;hment is not to be in&s;tanced. In the in|ce&s;&s;ant conflicts to which he was expo&s;ed, he main|tained his po&s;t with inflexible firmne&s;s and unaba|ted energy of mind&mdash;and, in the mo&s;t trying cir|cum&s;tances, di&s;charged his important duty with zeal, integrity and wi&s;dom. The &s;trict di&s;charge of the duty he owed to his country, rai&s;ed clamours again&s;t him among an intere&s;ted few in India; but the

<P>AFTER &s;o many hazards and hard&s;hips as I had undergone, it was a mo&s;t plea&s;ing reflect|ion to find my&s;elf in a &s;ociety compo&s;ed of my old|e&s;t profe&s;&s;ional connections, and warme&s;t and &s;in|cere&s;t friends: but this was a happine&s;s I could not long enjoy: for, being charged with a mi&s;&s;ion from HYAT SAHIB to the Governor-General and Su|preme Council, I was con&s;trained to proceed to Bengal, and accordingly &s;et &s;ail, for Calcu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eached in little more than a week, with|out encountering any accident, or meeting a &s;ingle occurence, worth the relation.

<SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Indi&s;po&s;ition has put it out of my power, &s;ince the fir&s;t day after my arrival here, to have the honour of paying you my re&s;pects, and of laying before you, for the information of the board, the objects of my mi&s;&s;ion to your &s;uperintending go|vernment.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="033487_0383_0FF7260A38299BF8">As the&s;e objects are of public importance, and as ill health may prevent me, for &s;ome time lon|ger from having the honour of waiting upon you, I take the liberty to beg your attention to this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The great revolution in favour of the India Company upon the we&s;t &s;ide of India, and to which I had the happine&s;s of being in &s;ome little degree in&s;trumental, has been certainly brought about by the zeal and &s;pirit of General MAT|THEWS; but that officer a&s;cribes to the orders and &s;upplies of your government the principal merit of the undertaking: he looks to the &s;ame government for &s;upport in the arrangement which he has made, and may make, for the &s;ecurity of the conquered province.</P>
<P>The hurry in which I left him, and his anxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ty for my &s;peedy communication of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, gave no time for a formal communication to the Governor-General and cooncil. of the particu|lars of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and of the arrangements which he wi&s;hed to be adopted. He wrote a &s;hort account of the fir&s;t to the Pre&s;idency of Fort St. George; and gave me a public letter to the Commander in Chief of the Military E&s;tabli&s;hment of that Pre&s;idency to which I par|ticularly belong, in atte&s;tation of the &s;ervices I rendered in the negociation between him and the Governor of Bidanore, for the &s;urrender of that capital and province. A copy of that letter I have the plea&s;ure to lay before you.</P>
<P>As I was charged with a particular commi&s;&s;ion from HYAT SAHIB, the manager of the Bidanore province, to the Governor-General and council, as appears by his letter, which I had the honour of pre&s;enting to you, General MATHEWS gave me, in verbal in&s;tructions, and memorandums written in his own hand, the particulars of what he wi&s;hed me to repre&s;ent to your Government:
<PB N="385" REF="033487_0384_0FF7260BD51844C0">
he gave me, be&s;ides, &s;hort notes of introduction to two of the members of Government, whom he knew per&s;onally&mdash;referring them to me for an account of his &s;ituation, and allowing me, I believe, more credit than I de&s;erve, for the &s;hare I had in contributing to his final acqui&s;i|tion of Bidanore without drawing a &s;word.</P>
<P>It would be tedious, and more fit for the de|tail of conver&s;ation than of a public addre&s;s, to inform you of the various &s;teps that led to the &s;urrender of the capital and province of Bida|nore. I had had &s;everal conferences with HYAT SAHIB before HYDER'S death, and endeavoured to &s;ugge&s;t to him the advantage which would ari&s;e to him from a revolt in favour of the Com|pany. My efforts in the&s;e conver&s;ations ended ultimately in the mo&s;t rigorous di&s;tre&s;s to my&s;elf: I was put in irons, and remained &s;o for four months, in a &s;ituation only of exi&s;tence without any hopes of ever e&s;caping. When General MATHEWS had &s;tormed the Ghauts, HYAT SA|HIB &s;ent for me, and, after various &s;truggles, and much indeci&s;ion, agreed to my proceeding to the Engli&s;h camp; and I conducted General MA|THEWS, almo&s;t unattended, into Bidanore. HY|AT SAHIB at length agreed to &s;ubmit: but as, in his various conver&s;ations with me before and af|ter that event, he made a very particular di&s;tinc|tion between the government of Bombay and the chief government of the Engli&s;h in Indo&s;|tan, &s;o he propo&s;ed that I &s;hould immediately depart, after he had given up the place and all the forts of the Province, with a letter to you, to obtain your &s;anction to me to his arrangements with the Engli&s;h General.</P>
<P>The&s;e arrangements were not even clearly de|fined before my departure; and &s;o anxious was he for my &s;peedy arrival at Calcutta, that he only
<PB N="386" REF="033487_0385_0FF7260E6D72B078">
gave me the general propo&s;itions that are con|tained in his letter.</P>
<P>Permit me here to ob&s;erve, that it is by the treatment which HYAT SAHIB meets with, that the other chiefs of HYDER'S country will e&s;ti|mate the advantage of abandoning the intere&s;ts of TIPPOO SAHIB, or will confirm their depen|dence upon him. TIPPOO was prevented by his father from all intercour&s;e with the Gover|nors of his provinces, or any interference in country affairs; &s;o that tho&s;e left in charge at his father's death are &s;tranger's to him, and are men to whom he has little attachment. He is, be|&s;ides, con&s;idered to be of a cruel di&s;po&s;ition. His father was cruel upon a political principle: he is thought to be &s;o from nature.</P>
<P>The unfortunate differences about money which aro&s;e in General MATHEWS'S camp, and of which you will probably hear from the Pre&s;i|dency of Bombay, took up much of the Gene|ral's time, and may have retarded his operations: however, his &s;ucce&s;s in the reduction of Manga|lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e gives a &s;ecurity to his conque&s;ts. The reve|nues of the Bidanore Province are about twenty lacks of pagodas per annum.</P>
<P>The particular &s;ituation of the capital merits attention. It is placed in a valley of con&s;idera|ble extent in circumference: according to the be&s;t ob&s;ervation I could make, there is an a&s;cent to it, from all &s;ides, of near &s;even miles: it can only be approached by four roads, which are cut among the hills, and which were judiciou&s;ly for|tified with great pains by HYDER: woods, to the depth of many miles, are a frontier round its &s;kirts; and where the&s;e admitted a pa&s;&s;age, HYDER took the precaution to plant bamboos and thorns&mdash;&s;o that I have little fear but that General MATHEWS will be able to defend the&s;e pa&s;&s;es; and as for provi&s;ions, and military &s;tores
<PB N="387" REF="033487_0386_0FF72613CD69C2F8">
of all kinds, that were found in Bidanore, of the latter particularly, what, according to Gene|ral MATHEWS'S own declaration, would equip nine &s;uch armies as his.</P>
<P>Cundapore is the next &s;ea-port to Bidanore, and is di&s;tant about fifty miles: Mangalore is di&s;tant about a hundred miles. The road lead|ing from Mangalore joins with that from Cunda|pore, where the a&s;cent of the hills commence: another road from Bidanore leads to Seringapatam, and a fourth into the Marhatta country.</P>
<P>It was from the lower country, along the &s;ea|coa&s;t, between Onore and Mangalore, which is watered by many rivers, and is the be&s;t cultivated country I ever &s;aw, that HYDER got the greate&s;t part of his provi&s;ions for his army in the Carna|tic; and, independent of the advantages which the Company have gained by the acqui&s;ition of the&s;e countries, the con&s;equent lo&s;&s;es of the My&s;oreans are immen&s;e, and &s;uch as will di&s;able them from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French in the Carnatic.</P>
<P>It becomes not an officer of my rank to make any ob&s;ervations that relate to the conduct of the different governments of my employers; but I am obliged to ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to HYAT SA|HIB'S declaration to me, that he will not rely upon any arrangement made in his favour by the Governor and council of Bombay, unle&s;s he has a &s;peedy an&s;wer to his letter from this govern|ment. He has reque&s;ted me to return with that an&s;wer, and with the &s;anction of the Governor-General to the cowl given to him by General MATHEWS. Though I am worn down by my &s;ufferings in pri&s;on, and my health can &s;carcely enable me to be carried by land, I am ready to undertake this &s;ervice; for I know it is the greate&s;t I may ever have it in my power to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|der to the company and to my country.</P>
<P>My return to the other coa&s;t with a favoura|ble an&s;wer to HYAT SAHIB, will be the &s;ignal to
<PB N="388" REF="033487_0387_0FF726155B0C0E98">
other Chiefs to throw off the yoke of TIPPOO; and if Colonel LONG has made any progre&s;s in the Coimbatore country, or that General MA|THEWS has not been too &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed by TIPPOO, I may arrive upon the other coa&s;t in time to be of real u&s;e to the company.</P>
<P>I know, Honourable Sir, the liberal and great &s;y&s;tem of your admini&s;tration: I will not, there|fore, point out any little circum&s;tances about the footing upon which I &s;hould return to HYAT SAHIB, or remain upon the other coa&s;t. I wi&s;h only to be rewarded by my employers as I am &s;ucce&s;sful; and I &s;hall leave it to your goodne&s;s, and to your di&s;tingui&s;hed zeal for the public pro|priety, to give me any in&s;tructions for my con|duct, or to charge me with any advices to Gen|eral MATHEWS, as you may think proper.</P>
<P>I hope you will pardon this long and irregu|lar addre&s;s, and honour me by communicating any part of it that you may think worthy of communication to the gentlemen of the council.</P>

<P>I have directed the affairs of the Soobeh of Hydernagur for &s;ome years pa&s;t, on the part of the NAVVAUB HYDER. When lately attacked by the victorious forces of the Engli&s;h under the command of General MATHEWS, I oppo&s;ed him, and fulfilled my duty in every re&s;pect: but &s;ee|ing the &s;uperior fortune and force of the En|gli&s;h, and receiving propo&s;als for peace from General MATHEWS, by the&s;e circum&s;tances, but more e&s;pecially by the per&s;ua&s;ions of Captain CAMPBELL, the &s;on of Colonel CAMPBELL, who was formerly at Chinaputtan, I was indu|ced to come to terms, and delivered up to Gen|eral MATHEWS the trea&s;ury, property, &s;tores and keys of the &s;orts of this country. If I had been di&s;po&s;ed, I had it in my power to have ap|propriated this collected wealth to other purpo|&s;es; but, from a regard to the high fortune of the KING of ENGLAND, and the uprightne&s;s and integrity of the Engli&s;h people, I have in|cluded my&s;elf in the number of your &s;ervants, and have determined, with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity and purity of heart, to &s;erve you well and faith|fully. By the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, under your au&s;pices, my endeavours towards the well and full performance of my duty &s;hall be ten-fold greater than heretofore; and as General MA|THEWS intends to proceed to Seringputtam, your loyal &s;ervant will a&s;&s;i&s;t, to the utmo&s;t of his ability and power.

<SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Some time ago, I did my&s;elf the honour of writing to you, on the &s;ubject of my mi&s;&s;ion from HYAT SAHIB to his government.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ure I now under&s;tand that you have come to the re&s;olution of &s;ending an an&s;wer to his letter. I cannot help delivering it as my opinion, that a decided and avowed protection granted to him from this government, will be productive of great public utility: but &s;hould you, and the other gentlemen of the council, think proper to decline this, from motives be&s;t known to your&s;elves, and of which I &s;hall not pretend to judge, I beg leave humbly to repre|&s;ent, that the &s;ooner HYAT SAHIB'S letter is acknowledged, the more &s;atisfactory it will be to
<PB N="391" REF="033487_0390_0FF67BAFD0E93940">
him, and the more efficacious in its probable good con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I am ready and anxious to proceed immediate|ly to the other coa&s;t with the an&s;wer to HYAT SAHIB, and &s;hall take the liberty of hoping that you will give me in&s;tructions to remain &s;ome time with him, that he may have an opportunity of tran&s;mitting, through me, any communication that he may wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h with this govern|ment. I have the plea&s;ure to inform you, that that Pre&s;idency to which I particularly belong, have granted me their con&s;ent to be employed in the final arrangement of the Bidanore treaty, &s;hould your board think proper to choo&s;e me as a fit per&s;on; and they have further unanimou&s;ly done me the honour to approve of my conduct in the commencement of this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the appointments you may judge right to allow me, I tru&s;t entirely to your own ideas of propriety. I wi&s;h for nothing more than what is &s;ufficient to defray the expences of &s;uch a journey, and to enable me to maintain that character in a &s;ituation of this kind which is requi&s;ite to promote the public good. I have the honour to be, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect,</P>

<P>After &s;ome delay, I received in&s;tructions, toge|ther with a letter from Mr. HASTINGS for HYAT, with which I &s;et off in order to deliver it into his own hands, as follows:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It would be unpardonable in me to let this occa|&s;ion pa&s;s, without expre&s;&s;ing the high &s;en&s;e I en|tertain of Mr. HASTINGS'S politene&s;s, and Sir JOHN MACPHERSON'S kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, during my &s;tay at, Calcutta. As to Mr. HASTINGS, in his public capacity, it would be pre&s;umptuous and injudicious to &s;ay much, as he now &s;tands for the judgment of the highe&s;t tribunal in this coun|try. My own ob&s;ervation leads me to con&s;ider him as a man of &s;ound, acute and brilliant talents, and of a va&s;t and comprehen&s;ive mind&mdash;of manners &s;ociable, amiable, meek and unaffected&mdash;and of a di&s;po&s;ition truly benevolent. His &s;uperior know|ledge of the political intere&s;ts of Indo&s;tan, and particularly of the affairs of the Ea&s;t India compa|ny, has never been que&s;tioned; and, if the &s;uffrage of the people of India may be allowed to decide, his conduct as Governor-General, though, like every thing human, intermixed with error, was, on the whole, great and laudable&mdash;for I declare I &s;carcely ever heard a man in India, Native or Eu|ropean, cen&s;ure him, although he was often the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation with all per&s;ons and in all companies in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial virtues of Sir JOHN MACPHERSON are &s;o well known, that it would be &s;uperfluous to notice them. The &s;ame friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality I experienced in his hou&s;e, has been &s;hared by many, who are not backward in doing him ample ju&s;tice on that head. But his conduct during his
<PB N="394" REF="033487_0393_0FF7262719D9D410">
&s;hort admini&s;tration can be known only by tho&s;e who make the political concerns of India a &s;ubject of &s;tudious attention: To enter into a detail of his various wi&s;e regulations for the re&s;toration of the company's affairs, would be de&s;tructive of the end I propo&s;e, which is, by a conci&s;e and &s;imple &s;ummary of the whole, to render a fair picture of his admini&s;tration &s;o clear as to be under&s;tood by any per&s;on, however ignorant he may be of the politics of that country, and &s;o brief as not to di&s;|courage the reading of it.</P>
<P>Sir JOHN MACPHERSON took the reins of government into his hands on the fir&s;t of February, 1785. He found the company's revenues dimi|ni&s;hed, and their expenditure increa&s;ed, by the continual claims of Proprietors, Directors, and Mini&s;ters, to a &s;hare in the patronage of Mr. HASTINGS&mdash;and a public debt accumulating to an enormous amount. He therefore &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of putting in practice every expedient po&s;&s;ible, and trying every experiment that the &s;tate of the country &s;ugge&s;ted, as likely to promote an increa&s;e of the revenue, a diminution of the public expen|diture, and a liquidation of the debt. He, there|fore, on the fourteenth day of his admini&s;tration, commenced a reform, which he continued with indefatigable zeal and indu&s;try to introduce through the various departments of government&mdash;and, be|ginning with him&s;elf, di&s;charged his body-guards. While he was thus employed in India, the Com|pany and Parliament in England were unremit|tingly engaged con&s;idering and molding into &s;hape a &s;y&s;tem of reform al&s;o; and, extraordinary as it may appear, the fact is, that the &s;agacity of Mr. MACPHERSON had adopted by anticipation, and actually reduced to practice, the identical &s;pe|culative reforms which the Parliament and Com|pany were proceeding upon in England; and the general plan of reform which pa&s;&s;ed the court of
<PB N="395" REF="033487_0394_0FF7262C2C87CF90">
directors on the eleventh of April, 1785, had been actually carried into execution by Sir JOHN MAC|PHERSON in Bengal, in the months of February, March and April, 1785. He made arrangements for the diffu&s;ion of knowledge&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ettlement of Pulo Penang, or Prince of Wales's I&s;land&mdash;&s;ettled the bank of Calcutta on a firm ba&s;is &mdash;regulated the markets&mdash;and, by a plan of his own conception, &s;ecured the Company from the accu&s;tomed fraudulent compo&s;itions with Zemin|dars, by bonding their balances, and making the bonds cancelable only by the Court of Directors. In fine, he introduced and carried into effect a &s;y&s;tem of reform which had a mo&s;t &s;udden and &s;alutary effect on the Briti&s;h affairs in India; and in an admini&s;tration of only eighteen months, he had the felicity to perceive the fruits of his wi&s;|dom and indu&s;try maturing&mdash;to receive that be&s;t of earthly rewards, the e&s;teem and applau&s;e of his fellow-citizens&mdash;and to be honoured by the be&s;t of Sovereigns with the dignity of a Baronet.</P>
<P>While I was at Sir JOHN MACPHERSON'S hou&s;e, I happened, in conver&s;ation one day with Mr. MACAULY, Sir JOHN'S Secretary, to be talking over &s;ome part of my adventures; and found to my a&s;toni&s;hment, that he had, in his route to India, accidentally hired the very &s;ervant whom I had lo&s;t at Trie&s;te by &s;ending him for letters to Ve|nice; and Mr. MACAULY a&s;&s;ured me, that he found him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the good qualities I had expected to meet in him: but the poor fellow had died before my arrival at Calcutta, to my great mortification and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on in which I was to leave Calcutta was very unfavourable for a voyage by &s;ea, and the coa&s;t thereabouts is one of the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable in the world, I &s;et off by land for Madras, and in my way had an opportunity of &s;urveying that curious and grote&s;que monument of &s;uper&s;titious folly, cal|led
<PB N="396" REF="033487_0395_0FF7262DB8EE8A08">
the Jagranaut Pagoda. It is an immen&s;e, bar|barous &s;tructure, of a kind of pyramidal form, em|belli&s;hed with devices cut in &s;tone-work, not more &s;ingular than di&s;gu&s;ting. Chri&s;tian idolators, in forming types and figures of divine beings, always endeavour to repre&s;ent them with per&s;onal beauty, as proportionate to their divine nature as human &s;kill can make it. Tho&s;e Pagans, on the contrary, in forming their idols, ca&s;t out every ve&s;tige of beauty&mdash;every thing that, by the con&s;ent of man|kind, is &s;uppo&s;ed to convey plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; and, in their place, &s;ub&s;titute the mo&s;t extravagant, unnatural deformity, the mo&s;t loath&s;ome na&s;tine&s;s, the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting ob&s;cenity. It is not in lan|guage to convey an adequate idea of their temples and idols; and if it was, no purpo&s;e could be an|&s;wered by it, only the excitement of painful and abominable &s;en&s;ations. To keep pace with the figures of their idols, a chief Bramin, by &s;ome accur&s;ed artificial means, (by herbs, I believe), has brought to a mo&s;t unnatural form, and enormous dimen&s;ions, that which decency forbids me to mention; and the pure and &s;potle&s;s women, who from infancy have been &s;hut up from the &s;ight of men, even of their brothers, are brought to ki&s;s this di&s;gu&s;ting and mis&s;hapen mon&s;ter, under the prepo&s;terous belief that it promotes fecundity.</P>
<P>In this Pagoda &s;tands the figure of Jagranaut, (their god under Brama); and a &s;ightly figure it is truly!&mdash;nothing more than a black &s;tone, in an ir|regular pyramidal form, having two rich diamonds in the top by way of eyes, and a no&s;e and mouth painted red. For this god, five hundred prie&s;ts are daily employed in boiling food, which, as he &s;eldom eats it, they doubtle&s;s convert to their own u&s;e in the evening.</P>
<P>I &s;topped at Vizagapatnam for a few days with Mr. RUSSEL, who was chief of that place. His &s;tyle of living was &s;o exactly &s;imilar to that of an
<PB N="397" REF="033487_0396_0FF7262F4CD64528">
elegant family re&s;iding at their country-hou&s;e in England, that I felt my&s;elf more happy and com|fortable than I had been &s;ince my arrival in India; and that happine&s;s was much increa&s;ed by meeting Mr. MAXTON, who was married to Mr. RUSSEL'S daughter. This gentleman and I had, when mere boys, been &s;hipmates on our fir&s;t going out to India: a warm friend&s;hip took place between us, which has met with no interruption, but rather increa&s;ed from lap&s;e of time, and greater habits of intimacy. To &s;ee a man whom I &s;o entirely e&s;teemed, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t perfect dome&s;tic felicity, and &s;urrounded by a number of amiable connections and friends, was to me a &s;ubject of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing contemplation.</P>

<P>LEAVING Vizagapatam, I took my route along the coa&s;t, and arrived at Ma&s;ulipatam, where I heard rumours of the unfortunate fate of General MATHEWS. This threw &s;uch a damp upon my &s;pirits, that all the ho&s;pitality and kind|ne&s;s of Mr. DANIEL, the chief, could &s;carcely rai&s;e me from de&s;pondence; and on my arrival at Ma|dras, I found the whole amply confirmed.</P>
<P>As HYAT SAHIB'S affair yet remaining un&s;et|tled, and I con&s;idered my&s;elf in a degree pledged to obtain him &s;ome &s;atisfaction for his &s;ervices in &s;urrendering the province of Bidanore, and to ful|fil my engagements with him and the Supreme Council, I determined to proceed to Bombay, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;a&s;ter of General MATHEWS, which had entirely cru&s;hed all my private pro&s;pects in that quarter, and to co-operate with HYAT SA|HIB
<PB N="398" REF="033487_0397_0FF72632DDDCE9A8">
in &s;uch mea&s;ures as might yet remain to us for promoting the public good. I left Madras, therefore, and pro&s;ecuted my journey without any material interruption until I reached Palamcotah, where the chagrin ari&s;ing from my various di&s;ap|pointments, co-operating with fatigue and climate, threw me into a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which confined me to my bed for five or &s;ix weeks. Upon recovering a little, I crawled on to Anjengo, where, at the hou&s;e of Mr. HUTCHINSON, the Re&s;ident, (who treated me with cordial kindne&s;s), I waited for an opportunity of getting to Bombay, and during that time laid in a &s;tock of &s;trength and &s;pirits: at length a Europe &s;hip touched at Anjengo on her way to Bombay, I obtained a pa&s;&s;age and pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>At Bombay I found HYAT SAHIB, it having been deemed expedient to &s;end him away from Bidanore on the approach of TIPPOO with his army, where I received from him a confirmation of what I have &s;tated re&s;pecting General MATHEWS receiving only two lacks of rupees and a necklace. And now, as peace was negociating between us and TIPPOO, and my remaining on the Malabar coa&s;t could be of little u&s;e, I determined to return to the Carnatic. And here I have an incident to add to the many di&s;agreeable occurrences of my life, in which, with intentions the mo&s;t innocent, I was made the &s;ubject of obloquy and unmerited &s;candal.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at the time I was leaving Bombay, a young lady, the daughter of a per&s;on formerly of high rank in India, and now a member of Parliament, but who&s;e name it would be u&s;ele&s;s to mention, wi&s;hed to return to the Carnatic; and I, at the reque&s;t of her&s;elf, and another lady with whom &s;he lived, unguardedly took charge of her during the journey. Before our departure, I reflected upon the difficulties and impropriety of this &s;tep,
<PB N="399" REF="033487_0398_0FF72636EB4EAB80">
and communicated my ideas to the ladies, who, in|&s;tead of li&s;tening to the objections I &s;tarted, pre&s;|&s;ed me to fulfil my promi&s;e: I con&s;ented, purely from principles of politene&s;s and good-nature. During the cour&s;e of our journey, &s;he unfolded to me, of her own accord, certain acts of cruelty and inju&s;tice &s;he had &s;uffered from her father, at the in&s;tigation of her <HI>mother-in-law,</HI> with a &s;tory of her innocence having fallen, and her reputation hav|ing been de&s;troyed, by a connection of the lady under who&s;e charge &s;he was, and who for that rea|&s;on had pre&s;&s;ed her departure with me; and added, &s;he was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with India, that &s;he determin|ed to quit it; and entreated me to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the accompli&s;hment of her wi&s;hes. I di&s;approved, in the mo&s;t unqualified terms, of her project&mdash;gave her the be&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted advice&mdash;and, through the whole di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s which was impo&s;ed upon me, acted merely with a view to her honour and happine&s;s; and &s;everal of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people in Palamcotah, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, and at Madras, where &s;he afterwards re&s;ided, could atte&s;t the delicacy of my conduct towards her, as well as the concern and intere&s;t I took in every thing that was likely to be of advan|tage to her.</P>
<P>This is a fair &s;tatement of the matter; and yet, on account of it, I was mo&s;t infamou&s;ly &s;candaliz|ed; and the &s;candal reached even the ears of my father, whom, however, I &s;oon &s;atisfied on that head. But that which &s;tung me to the quick was the conduct of &s;ome of my own relations, (who, if they even could not ju&s;tify or approve, ought at lea&s;t to have been &s;ilent), in becoming the mo&s;t virulent of my detractors&mdash;though, when the cha|racter of tho&s;e very relations had on former occa|&s;ions been reflected upon, I &s;tood up and defended them at the imminent hazard of my life. Such conduct appeared to me mo&s;t atrocious; for, whe|ther
<PB N="400" REF="033487_0399_0FF7263878CA96E8">
from affection, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or pride, I always &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported my relations, if I heard them traduced in their ab&s;ence&mdash;and, when I was not able to ju&s;tify their proceedings, at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the conver&s;ation. To a man who had uniformly acted &s;o. were there even no reciprocation of family affection, mutual ju&s;tice demanded different treatment from that I experienced, which could have &s;prung only from depravity of heart, poverty of intellect, and the mo&s;t abject meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. And what is remarkable on this, as well as on other occa&s;ions, tho&s;e who had been under the greate&s;t obligation to my father and my&s;elf, were the mo&s;t inveterate.</P>
<P>On the death of my father, looking over his pa|pers in the pre&s;ence of the Deputy Sheriff of Argyll, and three other gentlemen, we met with a letter on the &s;ubject from the young lady's father to mine, reflecting in a gro&s;s manner on my cha|racter. I directly wrote to that gentleman, explain|ing the whole affair, and demanding ju&s;tice to be done to my reputation. Upon an ecclaireci&s;&s;ement of the matter, he wrote to me a complete apology, acknowledging that he had acted on that occa&s;ion through mi&s;repre&s;entation, and had too ea&s;ily given credit to ill-founded reports; and &s;aying, that as the letter in que&s;tion had, by the peru&s;al of the Deputy Sheriff and other gentlemen, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure become a matter of public notoriety, he thought it incumbent on him to make that apology, and to expre&s;s his &s;incere regret for any detriment I might have &s;u&s;tained, by his yielding unguardedly to a &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed, as he was then perfectly convinced, by mi&s;information.</P>
<P>Thus was my character at once cleared of a ca|lumny which the indu&s;trious villany of a few had contrived to propagate through every &s;pot of the earth where I was known.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="033487_0400_0FF7263A0D0FB830">This &s;tory may &s;erve as an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to you, my FREDERICK, to avoid, in the very fir&s;t in&s;tance, any connection with women that in the probable cour&s;e of things can lead to private acts of confidence: they are at be&s;t indi&s;creet&mdash;tend, as in this ca&s;e, to make a man a dupe&mdash;and never fail to lead to &s;candal and reproach.

I have known it frequently, as in this in&s;tance, end in mortification and regret.</P>
<P>Before quitting entirely the Malabar coa&s;t, I took a trip to Surat, which amply repaid me for my trou|ble. It &s;urpa&s;&s;es any part of India for extent and variety of commerce, for populous &s;treets and &s;u|burbs, and for a continually moving &s;cene of opu|lence.

With the ob&s;ervations which I made in the cour&s;e of this excur&s;ion and my re&s;idence at Canton, I would furni&s;h you, but that Lord MACARTNEY'S emba&s;&s;y is ju&s;t returned from that country; and there is every rea&s;on to hope that he, or &s;ome of the gentlemen who atten|ded him, and who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior abilities and more ample materials, will favour the public with a much more perfect account than mine could po&s;|&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>While I remained at Canton, a very di&s;agreeable rupture took place between the Factory and the Chine&s;e. An Engli&s;h &s;hip lying at Wampoa, in &s;aluting, &s;hattered a Chine&s;e boat; by which acci|dent, two men in it were much hurt with the &s;plin|ters, and one of them died of his wounds &s;oon af|ter. The matter was clearly explained to the Man|darins; and they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied that it was merely an accident. A few days after, the Super|corgo of the &s;hip was forcibly &s;eized, and carried into the city: the Council met, and determined to &s;end for the &s;ailors from the &s;hips; and in the even|ing after dark, fifteen or &s;ixteen, boats, with four or five hundred men attempted, in an irregular manner, to come up to Canton&mdash;were fired upon by the Chine&s;e boats and forts in pa&s;&s;ing, and, with a few men wounded, were compelled to retreat. Nothing could &s;urpa&s;s the con&s;ternation and inde|ci&s;ion of the Council; and after the mo&s;t humilia|ting language, they were obliged to appea&s;e the Chine&s;e, and &s;ettle the affair by giving up the gun|ner of the &s;hip to their re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="033487_0403_0FF72645E9072C80">On the 29th December, 1784, I embarked in the Pon&s;borne Ea&s;t-Indiaman, Captain HAMMET, in which I had come from Madras to China; and, after a tolerable voyage of five months and two days, got on board a fi&s;hing boat off Falmouth, and was put on &s;hore there, having been exactly four years and five days from England.</P>
<P>Such was my impatience to &s;ee you, that I wrote from Falmouth for you to meet me at Bath. We arrived there the &s;ame day: and never in my life did I experience &s;uch tran&s;ports as in fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ing you to my bo&s;om; I found you all that my heart could wi&s;h; and I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to my opinion, aver, that not one action of your life has tended &s;ince to give me a moment's pain: on the contrary, I have every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied that my &s;anguine hopes of you will be realized. The turn of your thoughts and actions have been vigilantly watched and clo&s;e|ly examined by me; and from your affection to my&s;elf and your mother, your gentle deportment to my dome&s;tics, your frankne&s;s and candour with your brother and &s;chool-fellows&mdash;even from your fondne&s;s for your favourite dog <HI>Pompey,</HI> and fre|quent &s;ilent contemplations of the etchings of his countenance, I have drawn the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pre|&s;ages of purity and innocence of heart, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and refined honour and genero&s;ity. If it plea&s;es GOD to &s;pare your life, and &s;trengthen your con&s;titution, I &s;hall &s;till be the happie&s;t of men, notwith&s;tanding the inroad made upon my feelings by the hard&s;hips and afflictions I had un|dergone, of which many aro&s;e from unavoidable accident, and &s;ome from malignant and unnatural per&s;ecution, ari&s;ing from ba&s;e envy, dictated by cowardly revenge. I do not wi&s;h you to know who the wretches are: I only wi&s;h you to know that &s;uch dete&s;table pa&s;&s;ions do exi&s;t in human na|ture&mdash; that, warned by their wickedne&s;s to me, you

may, in your progre&s;s through life, be cautious, temperate and guarded.</P>
<P>Another thing I am anxious to impre&s;s upon the mind, particularly, of your brother JOHN, is the danger of a warm, impetuous temper. Many of the hazards and difficulties of my life aro&s;e from the predominance of a fiery &s;pirit, and an ungov|ernable, mi&s;taken ambition. A &s;ingle in&s;tance will &s;erve to &s;hew it. When I was under the com|mand of Captain, afterwards General MATHEWS, in his regiment of cavalry, being cantoned at a place called Tuckolam, in the neighbourhood of exten&s;ive woods, information was brought us that wild bulls infe&s;ted the neighbouring villages, and had killed &s;ome people: we prepared to enter the wood, and de&s;troy, if po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e ferocious ani|mals, which had become the terror and de&s;truction of the contiguous country. The origin of tho&s;e wild herds was this&mdash;From time immemorial, a re|ligious cu&s;tom had prevailed among the Pagan in|habitants, of offering a calf to the wood upon the accompli&s;hment of any favourite purpo&s;e, &s;uch as the &s;afe delivery of his wife, or the obtaining an employment, &amp;c. In proce&s;s of time, tho&s;e calves bred, and became numerous and incredibly fierce. Independent of protecting the defencele&s;s natives, it was in it&s;elf a mo&s;t intere&s;ting kind of hunting. The mode of doing it was this&mdash;A large party, well mounted, galloping in a body up to a great flock, and marking out the fierce&s;t champion of the whole, attacked him with &s;words and pi&s;tols. One day, a bull which was wounded, and thereby rendered more fierce, though not le&s;s vigorous, got po&s;ted in &s;ome thick bu&s;hes, in &s;uch a manner as to be approached only in front: a whim of the mo&s;t extravagant kind came into my head, &s;ugge&s;t|ed by vain-glory and youthful fire&mdash;I thought it ungenerous for &s;o many to attack him at once; and, wi&s;hing to have the credit of &s;ubduing him, I di&s;|mounted
<PB N="406" REF="033487_0405_0FF7264A30798BC0">
from my hor&s;e, and attacked him with a pike: I &s;oon, however, had cau&s;e to repent this ra&s;h and unwarrantable &s;tep; it had nearly been fatal to me&mdash;for the bull &s;oon threw the pike into the air, and, had it not been for the very gallant exertions of my brother officers, who rode in upon him, and re&s;cued me at the moment that the brute's horns had touched my coat, I mu&s;t have been kil|led. An Indian officer, who was in my troop, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, at the imminent hazard of his life, the bull having to&s;&s;ed his hor&s;e and him&s;elf to a di&s;tance from his horns. At this time I was but eighteen years of age, and had not the judgment to reflect, that if I had been killed, my fate would be attended with only pity or &s;corn for my folly; whereas, had I &s;ucceeded, the whole reward of my danger would have been the u&s;ele&s;s applau&s;e of &s;ome young&s;ters, idle and incen&s;iderate as my&s;elf&mdash;while my ra&s;hne&s;s would have been re|probated by every man who&s;e good opinion was worth enjoying. One or two people who were pre&s;ent at the time, are now living in great repute in England. We &s;ucceeded, however, in driving tho&s;e wild cattle into the interior rece&s;&s;es of the wood, dividing the fle&s;h of tho&s;e we killed among &s;uch of the poor S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">poys as would eat it, and there|by rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the contiguous villages.</P>
<P>Often when I have heard, in coffee-hou&s;es and play-hou&s;es, &s;ome of our &s;porting &s;parks boa&s;ting of their prowe&s;s over a timid hare or a feeble fox, I could not help recollecting with re&s;pect the hun|ters of India, who cha&s;e the de&s;tructive mon&s;ters of the fore&s;t&mdash;the boar, the tyger, the hyena, the bull, or the buffalo; and, while they &s;teel the nerves, animate the courage, and, by habitual deeds of pith, fit them&s;elves for war, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to their fellow creatures, and &s;ave the lives and property of thou&s;ands. Such greatne&s;s of &s;pi|rit,
<PB N="407" REF="033487_0406_0FF7264D769F7D70">
under the controul of good &s;en&s;e, and the di|rection of prudence, mu&s;t render a man re&s;pectable &mdash;but, if not managed with di&s;cretion, leaves a man no other prai&s;e than that of a magnanimous madman. Take every opportunity, my dear FRE|DERICK, of inculcating the&s;e precepts in the mind of your brother: the natural warmth of his temper often makes me fearful of the mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quences which I have my&s;elf too often experienced &mdash;though, I thank GOD, it never &s;timulated me to revenge, or to a premeditated intention of in|jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g any one.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid more than once, that I have a mo&s;t perfect conviction your amiable di&s;po&s;ition will en&s;ure to you the love of mankind; but it will at the &s;ame time &s;ubject you to many impo&s;iti|ons&mdash; to gaurd again&s;t which, a great &s;hare of &s;tern|ne&s;s is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary: there is, be&s;ides, a certain degree of fortitude ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to give lu&s;tre to a gentle di&s;po&s;ition; without it, meekne&s;s is thought timidity&mdash;mode&s;ty, weakne&s;s &mdash;and the charming mildne&s;s of the forgiving heart, abu&s;ed as the pitiful re&s;ource of abject apprehen&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and a mean &s;pirit. There are times, therefore, when the wickedne&s;s of men, and the cu&s;toms of the world, make it nece&s;&s;ary to lay a&s;ide the lamb, and a&s;&s;ume the lion. EUROPE at this moment pre|&s;ents an awful and alarming cri&s;is. In a neighbour|ing country, the conduct of the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety has produced a dreadful convul&s;ion:&s;ocial order has been &s;ubverted, and the &s;tability of pro|perty annihilated: all rea&s;oning from the hi&s;tory of former times is found inapplicable to the pre|&s;ent: the &s;y&s;tem of warfare it&s;elf has undergone a revolution; and no man is able to &s;ay from po&s;itive inference, "Thus will it be to morrow." Our in&s;ular &s;ituation, thank GOD! protects us: and the precarious footing upon which civil order and property &s;tand in mo&s;t countries on the continent,
<PB N="408" REF="033487_0407_0FF7265027E79768">
make our &s;tate in England enviable. The time is neverthele&s;s pregnant with extraordinary event; and you are now approaching that age at which men &s;hould be ready to act at the call of their coun|try. It is therefore fitting for you to make &s;uch things the &s;ubject of frequent contemplation&mdash;to habituate your mind to the meeting of danger, &s;o as to be ready, at a moment's warning, to lay down your life, if nece&s;&s;ary, for the good of your coun|try; for, after all, my FREDERICK, what avails it whether we die in this way or in that?&mdash;to die with honour and a good con&s;cience, is all. Let prejudice be laid a&s;ide&mdash;and who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of com|mon &s;en&s;e, could he&s;itate a moment to prefer death in the field, to death with the loath&s;ome aggrava|tion of &s;ickne&s;s, the crocodile tears of pretended friends, and the painful emotions and lamentations of tho&s;e who really love us?</P>
<P>Finally, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that at the time I left In|dia, the affairs of the Briti&s;h Nation wore &s;o very lowering an a&s;pect, all per&s;ons acquainted with our concerns there, allowed nothing but a long &s;eries of wi&s;e mea&s;ures, with the be&s;t efficient &s;ervants to execute them, could re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cue the company from ruin. I am happy in being able now to &s;tate, without the po&s;&s;ibility of contradiction, that the clouds which menaced us in that quarter have &s;ince been gradually di&s;&s;ipating beneath the mea&s;ures of the BOARD of CONTROUL, under the direction of Mr. DUNDAS; and are at la&s;t entirely di&s;per&s;ed by the glorious admini&s;tration of Lord CORNWAL|LIS, who&s;e wi&s;dom in the cabinet tended no le&s;s to the &s;ecurity, than his military talents, ju&s;tice and moderation, to the honour, of GREAT BRI|TAIN in the Ea&s;t. The choice of &s;uch a per&s;on for the government of India, reflects credit on HIS MAJESTY'S Councils, and evinces that the pater|nal care and &s;olicitude of our amiable SOVEREIGN extend to the mo&s;t remote part of the Empire.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. LETTER FROM GENERAL MATHEWS, TO THE COURT OF DIRECTORS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY. (REFERRED TO IN THE FOREGOING LETTERS.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>HONOURABLE SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour of informing you of the &s;ucce&s;s of your arms on the Malabar coa&s;t. You will have received advices of the out&s;et of the expedition from Bombay, and the general pur|port of it. On the 12th of December, I &s;ailed with a &s;mall party; and thought proper, of my own accord, to land at Rajamundroog, in prefer|ence to any other place&mdash;becau&s;e, on this part of the coa&s;t. I had the double advantage of being able to &s;ecure my&s;elf until reinforced, and to procure provi&s;ions, which I could not have done at Cun|dapore, or any place to the &s;outhward, by rea&s;on of the numerous garri&s;ons, and the vicinity of them to the capital. The mea&s;ures and di&s;po&s;itions of the gentlemen at Bombay were &s;uch, that I could not place any dependence upon being timely reinforced from thence, or of having any &s;upply of provi&s;ions. Rajamundroog is on the top of a
<PB N="410" REF="033487_0409_0FF72655CAFE25E0">
high hill, and commands the entrance of the be&s;t river on the coa&s;t. We took it by &s;torm. The moment we landed, a &s;hort time was taken up in preparing to move towards Onore; for we had not a cooly, carriage, or bullock, to convey any &s;tores. The battering cannon, ammunition, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. were &s;ent by &s;ea; and the great additions that HY|DER had made to the fortifications of Onore and fortified I&s;land, prevented my entering the river with the &s;mall craft, and obliged me to land every thing through a heavy &s;urf on the beach, and then to cro&s;s the river to the northward of the fort. The&s;e impediments were got over; and a practica|ble breach being effected, the a&s;&s;ault was made&mdash; and the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of two thou&s;and five hundred men, were either killed, drowned, or made pri&s;oners.&mdash;Shortly after this event, the troops from the &s;outhward, under Lieutenant Co|lonel MACLEOD, were landed at Rajamundroog. To wait for a junction, would take up much time: &s;o, that not a moment &s;hould be lo&s;t, I embarked, and landed near Cundapore, under the fire of the Bombay Grab and the Intrepid, and immediately &s;eized a &s;mall fort that &s;erved to &s;ecure our &s;tores. The enemy were in &s;ight, and &s;eemed numerous: &s;ome pri&s;oners that we took, reckoned them at twelve hundred hor&s;e, one thou&s;and Sepoys, and five hundred Peons. My party was compo&s;ed of three hundred and fifty Europeans, &s;ix hundred Sepoys, and four &s;mall field-pieces&mdash;with which I marched, fir&s;t towards the enemy, who drew back, and then I proceeded to Cundapore. They incom|moded my rear very much; but being determined to attack the fort, I only acted on the defen&s;ive, and at &s;even in the evening got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, and the &s;everal redoubts that commanded the river. The grand object of the expedition, an at|tack upon Bidanore, remained to be undertaken; and much &s;erious reflection it required before the
<PB N="411" REF="033487_0410_0FF726586239B030">
hazardous enterprize &s;hould be determined on.&mdash; Your Honours will now take a view of the &s;tate of my army: No carriage-bullock, and the few draft not able to draw eight light field-pieces&mdash;not a cooly to carry mu&s;quet, ammunition or provi&s;ions &mdash;not a tent&mdash;and many officers, HIS MAJESTY'S in particular, had not a &s;ingle &s;ervent&mdash;neither bul|lock or &s;heep to be had, the enemy having drove them off. The army, at this time, con&s;i&s;ted of about eleven hundred effective Europeans, and three thou&s;and Sepoys. The di&s;tance from Cun|dapore to the foot of the Ghaut is thirty miles, through a woody country: the enemy's army had been reinforced, and lay in the way. The reports of the &s;trength of the various works that defended the pa&s;s up the mountains, was &s;uch as gave me but very faint hope of &s;ucce&s;s; and the difficulty of &s;upplying my troops with rice, was almo&s;t of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to deter a per&s;on from the attempt. However, having po&s;itive orders to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bidanore, I re&s;olved to make a trial, and i&s;&s;ued directions for the march. We had not gone &s;ix miles, before the enemy oppo&s;ed us in force. We pu&s;hed forwards; and, by the effect of well &s;erved artillery, and the &s;teadine&s;s of the men, the enemy retired as we advanced. The &s;kirmi&s;h continued about three hours&mdash;after which we were left to pur&s;ue our route unmole&s;ted; nor did the enemy make any &s;tand till we were on the fourth day's march, within three miles of the pa&s;s&mdash;where, the ground being favourable, they attempted oppo&s;i|tion, and were roughly treated, lo&s;ing, by the bay|onet and &s;hot, above three hundred men. They were pur&s;ued to a &s;mall fort, which was immedi|ately abandoned; and then fled to the fir&s;t barrier or entrance of the pa&s;s. This was a line of ma|&s;onry that covered all the open ground, and was clo&s;ed by woods to the right and left. Upon &s;ix ba&s;tions were mounted fifteen pieces of cannon;
<PB N="412" REF="033487_0411_0FF7265B57F193E0">
and on the left was a work on a &s;teep mountain, with two twelve pounders. This altogether had too formidable an appearance to attack in front; but having reconnoitred the right, I imagined that the flank might be turned by a&s;cending the hill through the wood. Early in the morning, two parties were formed&mdash;one to attempt the flank, the other to e&s;calade the wall; but the enemy &s;aved us that trouble by evacuating the place. This was a happy moment to try the pa&s;s; for the enemy, by felling trees, &amp;c. would have thrown &s;o many ob|&s;tacles in the way, that the want of provi&s;ion would have compelled me to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign. A party was in&s;tantly ordered to follow the enemy up the hill, which, with little lo&s;s, gained the &s;econd barrier, on which were mounted eleven guns. Fifty of the enemy were killed or taken at this work. Having this &s;ucce&s;s, I relieved the ex|hau&s;ted by fre&s;h detachments, which excited emu|lation, and encouraged the ardour of the Sepoys; for, to the unremitting exertions of this branch of your troops is due the honour of this day. Battery after battery was taken; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ort on the top of the Ghaut, about five in the afternoon, called Hyderghur, crowned the whole. At this fort we found mounted thirty pieces of cannon, from twenty-four to four pounders; and at the different works in the pa&s;s, forty others, from four to twelve.</P>
<P>When we contemplated the numerous redoubts and the height of the Ghaut, and were told by pri|&s;oners that we had drove off &s;eventeen thou&s;and men, including di&s;mounted cavalry, regular Sepoys, and match-lock Peons, we could not con&s;ider the vic|tory we had gained as due to us&mdash;our weak efforts would have been in vain. The progre&s;s of your arms is to be a&s;cribed to the Divine will. In the cour&s;e of this war, Providence has been peculiarly bountiful&mdash;When we were in want of rice, we
<PB N="413" REF="033487_0412_0FF7265DDFA4E038">
were &s;ure to find a &s;upply left for our u&s;e by the enemy&mdash;when our mu&s;quet-ammunition was ex|pended, the enemy's magazines furni&s;hed us abun|dantly&mdash;cannon we found in every fort, and &s;uch quantities of warlike &s;tores, that we are apt to &s;up|po&s;e that HYDER &s;upplied all his garri&s;ons from this coa&s;t and from Bidanore. Hyderghur is about four|teen miles from Hydernagur, <HI>alias</HI> Bidanore, the capital of the Province.</P>
<P>In the night of the day that we gained the Ghaut, I was vi&s;ited by Captain DONALD CAMPBELL, the &s;on of Colonel CHARLES CAMPBELL. He had been wrecked off the coa&s;t, was &s;eized, and kept in irons, until the approach of this army cau&s;ed the Jemadar to relea&s;e him, to employ him as an Am|ba&s;&s;ador. His me&s;&s;age was, that the Jemadar hav|ing lo&s;t his Ma&s;ter (HYDER), and being upon bad terms with TIPPOO SAHIB, would willingly put him&s;elf under the protection of the Company, pro|vided that the management of the country was con|tinued to him. The idea of getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital and the forts of the kingdom towards Seringapatam, as well as the very great advantage I might expect from his experience, abilities and in|fluence, with the weak &s;tate of my army, induced me to clo&s;e with the propo&s;al; and I &s;ent him a cowl, &s;ignifying that his power and influence &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened. This, tho' not drawn with a pen of a lawyer, was equal in value to the capital of Bidanore. Captain CAMPBELL returned with it, and was to tell the Jemadar that I &s;hould march in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he morning.</P>
<P>Not expecting the great &s;ucce&s;s that we had met with by forcing the pa&s;s on the main road, I had detached Lieutenant-Colonel MACLEOD to the left to a&s;cend the Ghaut through a narrow path, in or|der to attack Hyderghur in the tear. The ab&s;ence of this detachment, and the fatigue of the former day, reduced my party to about four hundred Eu|ropeans
<PB N="414" REF="033487_0413_0FF726606B3B8CF8">
and &s;even hundred Sepoys; and all my guns were at the bottom of the Ghaut. With this detachment I moved towards Bidanore, and was within a mile of the walls before any me&s;&s;age came from Captain CAMPBELL or the Jemadar: but hav|ing nothing to apprehend in the field from the pa|nic-&s;truck enemy, we continued our march until the welcome approach of Captain CAMPBELL a&s;&s;ur|ed me the place was our own. On entering it, I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee about four hundred of your Sepoys that had been taken in the Carnatic, who offered me their &s;ervice. Upon vi&s;iting the Jemadar, I re|peated my a&s;&s;urances, that while he behaved faith|fully to the Company, the management of the coun|try &s;hould be continued to him; and, although the &s;word mu&s;t be in your hands, that he &s;hould have as much power and influence as his &s;tation required and that you would not refu&s;e &s;ettling upon him ve|ry ample allowances. The enemy being in force, and my army much weakened, with other di&s;agreeable matters that occured, prevented my further advance than to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two forts to the Ea&s;tward; for, being apprehen&s;ive that the Killidar of Manga|lore would not deliver up that place to the order of HYAT SAHIB, and con&s;idering that famous &s;ea|port of more con&s;equence to your affairs than ac|quiring territory beyond the mountains, I held my|&s;elf in readine&s;s to march that way, and was forced to lay &s;iege to it. A practicable breach being made, the Killidar thought proper to &s;urrender it. Upon this happy event give me leave to congratulate you; for it partly &s;ecures our conque&s;ts from Carwar to Cananore. There are two or three places that I have not been able to &s;ummons; but as the&s;e garri&s;|ons cannot expect any &s;uccour, they will fall of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus have I given your honours a &s;hort recital, from the fir&s;t landing of your arms on the 12th of December, to the reduction of Mangalore on the 9th
<PB N="415" REF="033487_0414_0FF72661F6F68E80">
of March; in which &s;hort time a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s has attended us that can hardly be paralleled. All the enemy's marine has fallen in our hands, among which are eight &s;hips of the line, either built or on the &s;tocks; and five of them might be &s;ent to &s;ea in a &s;hort time. After informing you of the happy and glorious &s;ucce&s;s of your arms, it is pain|ful for me to tell you, that di&s;&s;ention in the ar|my, on account of plunder and booty, has ari&s;en to &s;uch a height as to threaten open mutiny. I have informed your Honours of the terms that the Jemadar required, and that I in your name granted; and you know in how peacable a manner this capital was re&s;igned to you. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that HIS MAJESTY'S officers have been foremo&s;t in the cla|mours; and that the agents appointed by them have occa&s;ioned me much trouble and anxiety, and a great deal of di&s;content throughout the army. I &s;hall &s;end you copies of the &s;everal letters that have pa&s;&s;ed, for your determination. They may &s;up|po&s;e that I have appropriated trea&s;ure to my own u&s;e, or bargained to re&s;tore the private property of the Jemadar to him; or that I &s;hould agree that he &s;hould call all trea&s;ure and jewels his private pro|perty, to the exclu&s;ion of what of right &s;hould be|long to the Honourable Company or the captors. I have only to a&s;&s;ure your Honours, that I have made no bargain whatever, either public or private, but what was expre&s;&s;ed in the cowl &s;ent from Hy|derghur, to which Captain CAMPBELL was wit|ne&s;s: and as I have frequently mentioned to my friends, that I would not receive a pre&s;ent of con|&s;equence without the con&s;ent of the Honourable Company, I &s;hall inform you, that on my fir&s;t vi&s;it the Jemadar in&s;i&s;ted on making me a pre&s;ent of a lack of rupees; and when he plea&s;ed to give a do|nation to the army of two lacks and thirty thou&s;and of rupees, which &s;um waits your plea&s;ure, he re|que&s;ted I would accept of another lack of rupees.
<PB N="416" REF="033487_0415_0FF72667C9AF2FE0">
To both of the&s;e reque&s;ts re&s;pecting my&s;elf, I re|plied, that provided your Honours would give me leave, I &s;hould certainly embrace that fortunate moment to gain an independence, and &s;hall wait your orders as to the di&s;po&s;al of two lacks of ru|pees. How far my former and the pre&s;ent &s;ervi|ces may entitle me to your good opinion, and to your acquie&s;cence in thus rewarding me, is left to the genero&s;ity of your Honours: but I beg that you will believe, that during the cour&s;e of my &s;er|vices, every thing of a &s;imiliar nature &s;hall be laid before you.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy the avidity of a body of men, this little army would have a &s;uffiency of honour and profit to fill the mo&s;t greedy; but the infirmities of nature are not to be controuled by rea&s;on. Avarice of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency has pervaded the limits of &s;en&s;e, and &s;tepped be|yond the bounds of duty. The army, not content with acquiring, at the different places, that has been taken on the coa&s;t in &s;hips of war, naval &s;tores, merchandize, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in goods of va|rious kinds at Bidanore, which altogether the Je|madar &s;ays may be valued at thirty lacks of pago|das; they &s;eek to deprive the Jemadar of his pri|vate property, under pretence of the lawful rights of war; and a&s;&s;ume a &s;tyle and manner in their clamours and united addre&s;&s;es, that appears inten|ded to force from me what I think ought to be pre&s;erved for the public &s;ervice, and for the benefit of the Honourable Company. The manner that the fort and city was delivered to the company, does not authori&s;e me to touch private property; and the cowl implies a perfect &s;ecurtiy for all &s;uch. Would your honours be plea&s;ed, that by any rapa|cious action of your Commander in Chief, that he or the troops &s;hould forfeit the good opinion that may be entertained of them from their rapid &s;ucce&s;s, or that the public &s;ervice &s;hould be con|&s;idered

as a &s;econdary object? Our name has fallen almo&s;t to contempt, but, as far as lays in my pow|er, it &s;hall be recovered, if not rai&s;ed to its former eminence.</P>
