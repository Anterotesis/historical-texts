<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THEY who have read Mr. Littlepage's late Publications again&s;t Mr. Jay, have doubtle&s;s ob&s;erved, that all his Charges re&s;t on no other Evidence whatever, than his BARE ASSERTIONS. As it is impo&s;&s;ible to prove Negatives, the only que&s;tion that pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, whether any and what credit is due to his A&s;&s;ertions? Although Mr. Jay flatters him&s;elf that his Character affords a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, to all who know and wi&s;h not to mi&s;repre&s;ent it; yet, as there is rea&s;on to believe that this Young Man's Ebullitions have not been entirely &s;pontaneous, nor de&s;igned to &s;erve merely his own Purpo&s;es, it is thought expedient
<PB REF="019735_0004_0FACA531A5D72240">to lay before the Public all the Letters which have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Mr. Jay and him.</P>
<P>They will enable the Reader to perceive how far his con|duct has been influenced by candour and delicacy, and whether it exhibits tho&s;e marks of con&s;i&s;tency and ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s, which are nece&s;&s;ary to create and &s;upport an Opinion of his veracity. A compari&s;on of tho&s;e Letters with his late Publications, will determine whether the A&s;&s;ertions and Ac|counts contained in both, corre&s;pond with each other, or whether they are &s;o contradictory and repugnant as to have no claims to Credit: For Truth being immutable, it will in|variably &s;peak the &s;ame Language, and all its Accounts and Relations forever harmonize and agree.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PROBABLY you may be &s;urpri&s;ed at this letter, when you are informed that it comes from the per&s;on, whom Mr. <HI>T. Adams</HI> recommended to your pro|tection in Philadelphia: The anxiety which that worthy friend has always di&s;co|vered for my intere&s;t, will ever claim my warme&s;t gratitude; and I am far from e&s;teeming his recommendation of me to you, as a trivial in&s;tance of friend&s;hip. You were, (I doubt not) &s;urpri&s;ed at not hearing from me in America: I was, all &s;he la&s;t &s;ummer, in a very ill &s;tate of health; but never had the lea&s;t idea that my Guardian had neglected to inform you of my &s;ituation, and return the thanks due to your genero&s;ity: Soon after my recovery, I was much chagrined at receiving a me&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>Fleming,</HI> of Virginia, that <Q>you were to &s;ail immediately; but if my friends cho&s;e to &s;end me to Europe, you would take care of me.</Q> I then prevailed on my Guardian, to let me follow you; and, in a &s;hort time, em|barked on board a &s;hip bound to Bourdeaux, but was driven into this port by di&s;tre&s;s of weather, about the middle of February. For &s;ome time after my ar|rival, I could hear nothing of you; and had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe the Confederacy lo&s;t; but at length was informed of your &s;afe arrival in Spain: I acquainted Doctor <HI>Franklin</HI> with my &s;ituation, and he advi&s;ed me to write to you, and remain in France, till you in&s;tructed me how to proceed: This I &s;hould have done before, had I certainly known where to direct. I &s;hall be much obliged to you to write to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly, as I find it very expen&s;ive in this country.
<PB N="4" REF="019735_0006_0FACA533278942F8">Be plea&s;ed to direct your letter to the care of Mr. <HI>Bonfield,</HI> in Bourdeaux, where I &s;hall re&s;ide till it comes to hand. I have the honor to be, with the greate&s;t re|&s;pect, Sir, your grateful, and much obliged humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>YOUR favor of the 3d of April, reached me a few days pa&s;t at Nantz. I ar|rived but ye&s;terday in this city, and have now the agreeable pro&s;pect of being with you in a &s;hout time.

I am exceedingly obliged to you for your offer of &s;upplies, but for|tunately bad letters of credit to Nantz: I was at fir&s;t apprehen&s;ive of being obliged to go to Paris, to M. <HI>Beaumarchais;</HI> but the gentlemen, to whom I was recom|mended, have offered to advance whatever may be nece&s;&s;ary for the expences of my journey. The only opportunity that at pre&s;ent &s;eems to occur for my getting to Madrid with conveniency, is, in the company of an Envoy from the Court of Hungary to Spain, who is daily expected in Bourdeaux. Should I be di&s;appointed in this, fortune mu&s;t direct me. My mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments to your Lady, (who I have heard is with you.)

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Bonfield</HI> ye&s;terday informed me, that he had received a letter from you, with permi&s;&s;ion for me to remain &s;ome time longer in France: My peculiar &s;itua|tion, &s;ince my arrival in this country, has unfortunately prevented me from an a&s;|&s;idious application to acquire the French language grammatically. I have bad little or no &s;ociety with the natives of France, who were unacquainted with the Briti&s;h language; and all that I have as yet attained, is a &s;uperficial knowledge of a few words, &s;ufficient perhaps for a traveller.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of your la&s;t letter to Mr. <HI>Bonfield,</HI> I &s;hall this day leave Bour|deaux, and re&s;ide at the country &s;eat of a gentleman, &s;ome leagues di&s;tant; where it will be le&s;s difficult to acquire the French pronunciation.

<P>YOUR favor, of the 30th ult. has been delivered to me.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favor, of the 16th of June, agreeably interrupted my application to the barren rudiments of the French language: All the polite a&s;&s;iduities of the worthy family in which I re&s;ide, have been able to render my &s;ituation little bet|ter than a plea&s;ing hermitage.

<P>IT is with infinite regret that I mu&s;t acquaint you with my pre&s;ent di&s;agreeable &s;ituation.&mdash;A few days after the date of my la&s;t (the 15th ult.) I was &s;eized with vio|lent intermitting fevers, which continuing for &s;ome time with encrea&s;ing fervour, obliged me to leave my happy re&s;idence in the country, and return to this city; not only on account of the inconvenience which my di&s;ea&s;e unavoidably occa&s;ioned to the ho&s;pitable family, whom I but too much incommoded, but for the benefit of medicine and Phy&s;icians; all the &s;ervice, however, which the&s;e two powerful &s;up|ports of mortality have been able to render me, is, to convert an irregular fever into an ob&s;tinate periodical quartan; which has incredibly reduced me.

<P>I find my&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed from my ye&s;terday's fever, which continued all the night pa&s;t. But as the po&s;t for Spain, this day leaves Bourdeaux, nece&s;&s;ity obliges me to conclude. Your favor, of the 19th in&s;tant, was this moment de|livered to me: The warmth of &s;incere friend&s;hip glows in every line. The object, which you have &s;o &s;trikingly exhibited to my view, mu&s;t undoubtedly be animating to every mind endued with &s;en&s;ibility: But the happine&s;s of being in any degree u&s;eful to my country, is a &s;ummit to which my ambition dare not a&s;pire:&mdash;Con|&s;cious di&s;&s;idence forbids me to hope it.&mdash;To my friends I may, perhaps, be &s;er|viceable; at lea&s;t, inability &s;hall be the only ob&s;tacle. Your de&s;ire I perceive is, that I &s;hould remain &s;ome time longer in France, for the more perfect attainment of the language. Unfortunately, my re&s;idence in a French family, was but of &s;hort duration; I am now amid&s;t Americans and Engli&s;h: However, during my &s;hort retreat in the country, I acquired a &s;ufficiency for the nece&s;&s;ities of travelling, and common conver&s;ation: Their authors I have read with tolerable facility, and &s;ome degree of ta&s;te. This, joined with &s;ome more weighty rea&s;ons, will, I hope, pro|cure your con&s;ent for me to pro&s;ecute my long protracted journey to Madrid, as &s;oon as my health will permit.

<P>MR. <HI>Littlepage</HI> delivered me your favor of the 20th of November, 1779, on his arrival here from France, a few weeks ago: He fully ju&s;tifies the character given me of him by Col. <HI>Adams,</HI> and if he continues to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ivate his genius proper|ly, will one day do honor as well as &s;ervice to his country and connections.

<P>That from circum&s;tances immaterial to this &s;ubject, it &s;o happened, that a coolne&s;s then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and continued between Mr. Jay and Mr. Carmichael, his &s;ecretary to the legation.</P>
<P>That Mr. Littlepage (whether with de&s;ign to ingratiate him&s;elf with Mr. Jay, or from o &s;en&s;e of his kindne&s;s to him, was <HI>then</HI> problematical) frequently communicated to Mr. Jay, anecdotes of that gentlemen's conduct and language, with which it was impo&s;&s;ible Mr. Jay could be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>That in the latter end of May or beginning of June <HI>1781,</HI> Mr. Jay removed his fa|mily to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> one of the royal &s;eats, at which the court were to re&s;ide for &s;ome time: That while there, Mr. Littlepage took a fancy to go with the Duke de Crillon to <HI>Mi|norca,</HI> and warmly &s;ollicited Mr. Jay's con&s;ent, but <HI>without effect:</HI> That among other rea&s;ons which be urged in favor of his project, be in&s;i&s;ted largely on Mr. Carmichael's attempts to oppo&s;e and mi&s;repre&s;ent <HI>him,</HI> and how u&s;eful an acquaintance with the prin|cipal officers would be, to fru&s;trate the effects of &s;uch conduct in future.&mdash;He enumerated many in&s;tances and particulars, &s;ome of which were entirely new to Mr. Jay.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING you friendly endeavors to di&s;&s;uade me from my intention of accompanying the Duke of <HI>Crillon</HI> in the en&s;uing campaign, I find my inclination, honor, and let me add, my intere&s;t, too nearly concerned to admit the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of de&s;i&s;ting. Perfectly convinced, however, of the <HI>generous and candid motives</HI> which influence your conduct, I think it indi&s;pen&s;ibly incumbent upon me to explain to you in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner my rea&s;ons for per&s;evering.</P>
<P>In this unhappy aera of war and commotion, politicians and &s;oldiers are equal|ly nece&s;&s;ary: at a di&s;tance from my native country, and con&s;equently incapable of &s;erving it immediately in a military line, I think it &s;till my duty to embrace every opportunity of acquiring a degree of experience, which may one day prove beneficial. Your partiality to my abilities induces you to &s;uppo&s;e polities my proper &s;phere: Friend&s;hip &s;eems more prevalent than judgment in that conjecture: My pre&s;ent object is the attainment of the Spani&s;h language: the alternative is to retire to &s;ome village, or &s;pend a few months in the army; thel atter is infi|nitely more agreeable, <HI>le&s;s expen&s;ive,</HI> and more con&s;i&s;tent with my future plans of life.&mdash;Here, &s;ir, permit me to call your attention to &s;ome <HI>minute particulars, relative only to my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Neither your friend&s;hip nor my own caution can, I find, protect me from the <HI>machinations of a powerful and in&s;idious enemy:</HI> to his malicious in&s;inuations I can alone impute that univer&s;al coldne&s;s, with which every per&s;on in the lea&s;t influen|ced by <HI>him,</HI> continually avoids me. Su&s;picions to the prejudice of my character are infu&s;ed into the minds of all who appear di&s;po&s;ed to treat me with civility. <HI>Attempts have been, and are daily and hourly made, to irritate, and render me di&s;con|tented with you;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to <HI>&s;educe me</HI> into pur&s;uits which would tend to le&s;&s;en your good opinion of my <HI>honor and morals.</HI> The mo&s;t infamous fal&s;hoods

Your SECRETARY, MR. WM. CARMICHAEL, is the per&s;on to whom I allude.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly incen&s;ed and di&s;gu&s;ted at this unprovoked and inhumane treatment; ac|tuated by the mo&s;t honorable and ardent de&s;ire of exculpating my&s;elf from a&s;per|&s;ions equally odious and ill&s;ounded, and of obtaining &s;ome degree of re&s;pect among&s;t my pre&s;ent deluded acquaintances, I have formed the de&s;ign of entering, if po&s;&s;ible, into the family of his grace of <HI>Crillon,</HI> and &s;erving as a volunteer in the intended expedition from <HI>Cadiz.</HI> The connexions which I may there form; the reputation which only a decent line of conduct will inevitably procure; may, per|haps, convince the world that <HI>malice,</HI> not candor, could injure me.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE only letter which I have as yet had the plea&s;ure of receiving from you, is the one which Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI> brought with him from America, and is dated the 20th of November, 1779. In October, 1780, Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI> reached Ma|drid, and on the 21&s;t of November following, I had the honor of writing to you and Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> informing you of his arrival, and the objects which I advi&s;ed him to pur&s;ue; and which, from conver&s;ations with Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> I had rea&s;on to think, were perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his, and your views. I al&s;o thought it nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="15" REF="019735_0017_0FACA53B62DC54E8">in mentioning the expences he had incurred, to reque&s;t that you would fix the limits within which they &s;hould in future be confined.</P>
<P>From that time to this, he has been con&s;tantly in my family, and con&s;equently &s;ubject to few expences. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is time has, in my opinion, been upon the whole u&s;e|fully &s;pent; and had his application been equal to his talents, his progre&s;s might have been &s;till greater.</P>
<P>As the Court pa&s;s the &s;pring at Aranjuez, a royal &s;eat, about &s;even leagues di&s;tance from here, I removed my family there. About a fortnight ago, the public were informed, that the Duke de <HI>Crillon,</HI> to whom I had formerly intro|duced Mr. <HI>Littlepage,</HI> was appointed to command an expedition, to &s;ail from Ca|diz, but for what place is &s;till unknown.</P>
<P>Some days afterwards, Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI> &s;urprized me, by a propo&s;al to accompa|ny the Duke as a Volunteer on this expedition, and &s;trongly &s;olicited my con&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. I u&s;ed every argument to di&s;&s;uade him from it, but in vain; he &s;everal time renewed his application, and pre&s;&s;ed it with earne&s;tne&s;s, and I as of|ten told him, that my opinion of the plan remained fixed, and that as I did not approve of it, I could not patronize it. At length he wrote me a letter on the &s;ub|ject, in which he repeated his former arguments, to &s;hew the expediency of the plan; and al&s;o urged the tendency it would have to enable him, more ea&s;ily to from u&s;eful connections, in doing which he had experienced ob&s;tacles from the malevolence of one of his acquaintances.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, for your &s;atisfaction, in&s;ert the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> part of this letter, and my an&s;wer.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING your friendly endeavours to di&s;&s;uade me from my in|tention of accompanying the Duke of <HI>Crillon,</HI> in the en&s;uing campaign, I find my inclination, honor, and let me add, my intere&s;t, too nearly concerned to ad|mit the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of de&s;i&s;ting. I think it indi&s;pen&s;ably incumbent on me to explain to you, in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner, my rea&s;ons for per&s;evering.</P>
<P>In the unhappy aera of war and commotion, politicians and &s;oldiers are equally nece&s;&s;ary. At a di&s;tance from my native country, and con&s;equently incapable of &s;erving it immediately, in a military line; I think it &s;till my duty to embrace every opportunity of acquiring a degree of experience, which may one day prove bene|ficial: Your partiality to my abilities enduces you to &s;uppo&s;e polities my proper &s;phere: Friend&s;hip &s;eems more prevalent than judgment in that conjecture. My pre&s;ent object is the attainment of the Spani&s;h language,&mdash;the alternative is, to re|tire to &s;ome village, or &s;pend a few months in the army; the latter is infinitely more agreeable, le&s;s expen&s;ive, and more con&s;i&s;tent with my future plans of life.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have con&s;idered your letter of to day, with all the attention due to the impor|tance and delicacy of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The general rea&s;ons you urge for re&s;olving to per&s;evere in the plan of accompa|nying the Duke of <HI>Crillon,</HI> on the expedition in que&s;tion, are the &s;ame which we before fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in conver&s;ation. I mu&s;t candidly a&s;&s;ure you, that my opinion remains unaltered. It cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the rea&s;ons which I a&s;&s;igned to you for with-holding my con&s;ent and approbation. The conver&s;ations I had with your friend, Col. <HI>Adams,</HI> on the &s;ubject, led me to &s;uppo&s;e, that law and poli|tics were to be your objects; and I con&s;idered your coming to Europe, as de&s;igned for the purpo&s;e of facilitating the attainment of them; by giving you opportuni|ties of acquiring two u&s;eful languages, and of applying to &s;uch pur&s;uits and &s;tu|dies as might conduce to qualify you for the bar, and for civil employments. My knowledge of you, per&s;uades me, that your friends were wi&s;e in propo&s;ing the&s;e objects to your attention; and therefore, though I admire the &s;pirit which actu|ates you on this occa&s;ion, I cannot forbear di&s;approving your permitting it to car|ry you out of the &s;phere propo&s;ed for you to move in.</P>
<P>You was recommended to my care&mdash;I promi&s;ed that you &s;hould receive it:&mdash; Hence it became my duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the attainment of the objects before-men|tioned, but not to encourage or approve your pur&s;uing different ones.</P>
<P>I know that you ought, and I advi&s;e you, &s;teadily to follow wherever your du|ty may lead you, without being deterred by dangers or evils of any kind what|ever; and were it your duty to go on the propo&s;ed expedition, I &s;hould cea&s;e to e&s;teem you if you &s;uffered any per&s;onal con&s;ideration to re&s;train you. You &s;eem to admit that your duty does not require you to take this &s;tep, and, I think, you would do well to con&s;ider how far it will authorize it. This is a delicate &s;ubject, and yet the relations you &s;tand in to your country, your family and your friends, ought to be well weighed, before you embark in a mea&s;ure that may affect each of them. But you know my &s;entiments on all the&s;e points, having before dwelt mi|nutely on them. All I can do is to give you my advice; this I have done fully and candidly."</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I find that Mr. <HI>Lewis Littlepage,</HI> a young American gentleman in my family, has conveyed to your Excellency, through the Duke de <HI>Crillon,</HI> a reque&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;erve as a Volunteer in the Duke's family on the intended expedition.</P>
<P>"As my further &s;ilence on this occa&s;ion might appear &s;ingular, and perhaps di&s;re&s;pectful, I take the liberty of mentioning the rea&s;ons which prevented my ta|king a part in Mr. <HI>littlepage</HI>'s application.</P>
<P>"He was placed by his Guardian and friends under my particular care and pro|tection, and I am per&s;uaded it was their intention that he &s;hould confine him&s;elf to &s;uch &s;tudies and pur&s;uits, as might conduce to prepare him for the profe&s;&s;ion of the law and for <HI>civil</HI> employments. The tru&s;t they repo&s;ed in me, would not, therefore, permit me to con&s;ent to his quitting this line, and going into a <HI>military</HI> one; e&s;pecially as my <HI>private judgment</HI> led me to view an adherence to the fir&s;t plan as more conducive to his advantage.</P>
<P>"He has earne&s;tly and repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed me to con&s;ent, and on my continu|ing to with-hold it, finally told me, he was determined to make the campaign, if His Maje&s;ty's and the Duke's permi&s;&s;ion could po&s;&s;ibly be obtained; and hoped that I would take no mea&s;ures to oppo&s;e it. I replied, that I claimed no authority over him, and that I &s;hould never attempt to re&s;train him in any other manner, than by hone&s;t coun&s;el and di&s;intere&s;ted advice.</P>
<P>"I ought to inform your Excellency, that this Gentleman's character is fair: &mdash;I think highly of his integrity and abilities, and &s;hould be &s;ucceed in his appli|cation for his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, the reflection of his being in the family of the Duke, would afford me much con&s;olation.

</LETTER>
<P>But whatever might be the light in which this project appeared to me, it is cer|tain that the Spaniards were much plea&s;ed with the idea of a young American gen|tleman's offering to go as a Volunteer in their &s;ervice.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI> was much &s;poken of, and commended; and &s;o popular did his application &s;oon promi&s;e, an indeed begin to be, that &s;ome, on who&s;e attachment he had no great rea&s;on to rely, and who at fir&s;t treated the project with redicule, profe&s;&s;ed to be convinced of its proving advantageous, and let &s;lip no opportunity of appearing to patronize cordi|ally both it and him. He certainly gained much per&s;onal credit by it, and there were gentlemen of weight and di&s;tinction who advi&s;ed me very &s;eriou&s;ly to give my con&s;ent to his going, and to &s;upport his application for permi&s;&s;ion, adding, that it would &s;erve the American cau&s;e, &amp;c. I an&s;wered the&s;e gentlemen, that, on this occa&s;ion, I could act in no other capacity than that of Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI>'s friend; and that no con&s;ideration of convenience, either to the public or my&s;elf, would ever
<PB N="18" REF="019735_0020_0FACA53DA3B7DC20">prevail upon me to depart from what I conceived to be the &s;pirit of the tru&s;t you had repo&s;ed in me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI>'s idea was, in ca&s;e he obtained permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;et out in com|pany with the Duke, who daily expected to depart, and by that means avoid con|&s;iderable expences; but it unfortunately happened that he did not get it 'till after much delay, and after the Duke was on the road to Cadiz. It was not 'till Satur|day la&s;t that he was informed that his reque&s;t was granted. I advi&s;ed him, before the Duke's departure, to take &s;uch explicit arrangements with the Duke, as that no matters of expence might be le&s;t un&s;ettled, in ca&s;e he &s;hould have leave to go, (which I confe&s;s I did not think very probable) but this was omitted. When the King's permi&s;&s;ion was &s;ignified to him, it was too late; and no other alternative was le&s;t him, than either to decline accepting a favor he had &s;trongly &s;olicited, or &s;et out po&s;t for Cadiz, and arrange this bu&s;ine&s;s there as well as he could. The former could not be done con&s;i&s;tent with his honor, and the latter required ex|pences which I feared would be very di&s;agreeable to you. This dilemma reduced me to a very delicate &s;ituation&mdash;pre&s;uming however, that you would prefer the ex|pence, to the di&s;honor, I con&s;ented to furni&s;h him with as much money as might be nece&s;&s;ary for his journey and outfit, and propo&s;ed the pay of a Spani&s;h Cap|tain of foot, as a rea&s;onable allowance for his ordinary expences. This did not corre&s;pond with his ideas&mdash;he cho&s;e rather to be left at liberty to draw upon me for &s;uch &s;ums as he might from time to time find nece&s;&s;ary, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that I might rely on his ob&s;erving the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy. He expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions that a Captain's pay, which is twenty-two dollars and one half of a dollar per month, would probably be in&s;ufficient, and therefore wi&s;hed to be provided accordingly.</P>
<P>I told him that unlimited credit always appeared to me improper, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es where I was acting for others, that if Captains could live on this allowance, it would al&s;o be in his power; and that, if he &s;hould be admitted into the Duke's family, even le&s;s might be &s;ufficient. That therefore, notwith&s;tanding my con&s;i|&s;tence in his prudence, I could not think of going further; but hoped that he would endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to live within that allowance, and be cautious of ren|dering the bounty of his friends inconvenient to them.</P>
<P>I accordingly furni&s;hed him with money &s;ufficient to go to Cadiz, and provide again&s;t ca&s;ualties on the road, and with credit there on Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> for as much as, with what would probably remain of the former &s;um, would be nece&s;&s;ary to fit him out; and al&s;o the amount of a Spani&s;h Captain's pay for &s;ix months: which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vance apeared the more nece&s;&s;ary, as many are of opinion the Duke is going to South America. For my own part I doubt it; but yet, as it may be the ca&s;e, I could not think of letting him run the ri&s;que, without &s;ome money to be-friend him. I al&s;o thought it prudent not to exceed <HI>&s;ix months,</HI> as before that time, I might expect to receive your orders for my government in future.&mdash;He left us ye&s;|terday.</P>

The Amba&s;&s;ador of France being on the mo&s;t intimate footing with the Duke, and it being of importance to Mr. <HI>Littlepage,</HI> that the Duke &s;hould have every in|ducement to favor him with his friend&s;hip and protection, I gave him the following letter to deliver to the Amba&s;&s;ador at Aranjuez, viz.</P>

<P>"MR. <HI>Littlepage</HI> informs me, that he has obtained permi&s;&s;ion to accompany the Duke de <HI>Crillon,</HI> on the intended expedition.

</LETTER>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you a &s;hort, but accurate account of an affair, which mu&s;t from its nature be no le&s;s unexpected than intere&s;ting to you. How far my conduct upon this occa&s;ion may coincide with your &s;entiments, is not certain; but, however that may be, I flatter my&s;elf, you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that it was directed by the pure&s;t motives, and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted regard to what I thought right. If Mr. <HI>Littlepage's</HI> plan &s;hould meet with your approbation, no inconveniences can re&s;ult either to him or you, from my having <HI>in vain</HI> advi&s;ed him again&s;t it. But if, on the contrary, your &s;entiments re&s;pecting it &s;hould corre&s;|pond with my own, I hope you will further agree with me in opinion, that he &s;till merits your care and attention, and that a fine &s;oil ought not to be neglected, be|cau&s;e all its natural productions are not equally e&s;timable.&mdash;It demands only a greater degree of prudent, and perhaps patient cultivation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t again take the liberty of remarking, that, in my opinion, your allow|ance to him for expences, ought to be re&s;tricted to &s;ome fixed limits:&mdash;Your letter to me leaves them without bounds, and con&s;equently leaves us both to di&s;|agreeable differences in &s;entiment on a very delicate &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is with equal chearfulne&s;s, that I now repeat the a&s;&s;urances I before gave you, of my readine&s;s to be u&s;eful to Mr. <HI>Littlepage,</HI> whenever it may be in my power. I will with plea&s;ure and without he&s;itation, make him from time to time &s;uch ad|vances of money as may be nece&s;&s;ary, and con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch orders as I may re|ceive from you:&mdash;And I mu&s;t reque&s;t the favor of you, to &s;end me immediately, and by different opportunities, expre&s;s and particular directions about it.</P>
<P>The annexed account of what I have already advanced, and engaged to pay,
<PB N="20" REF="019735_0022_0FACA53F238EA940">will &s;hew how nece&s;&s;ary it is, that the&s;e matters be &s;peedily arranged, and regular remittances made; which may be done without difficulty or ri&s;que by bills of ex|change. The extent of my own expences here, renders punctual reimbur&s;ements indi&s;pen&s;ible; and le&s;t unexpected occurrences, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, &s;hould again tempt Mr. <HI>Littlepage</HI> into deviations from the line you may chu&s;e he &s;hould ob&s;erve, I really think that the &s;ooner you give him and me your &s;entiments and orders about it, the better.</P>
<P>The object of the expedition is, as I &s;aid before, unknown; but the more ge|neral opinion is, that it is not very di&s;tant, and will &s;oon be decided. If no acci|dents &s;hould happen to Mr. <HI>Littlepage,</HI> I expect he will return in the fall, and I hope, before that time, to have the plea&s;ure of receiving an an&s;wer to this letter. Whatever intelligence I may in the mean time receive of, or from him, &s;hall be immediately communicated to you. He has promi&s;ed me to write to you and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> before he leaves Cadiz. I &s;hall tran&s;mit this letter to the Delegates of Virginia, in Congre&s;s, and reque&s;t the favor of them to forward it to you.

My &s;ituation is &s;o per|fectly changed, that I can &s;carce beleive my&s;elf to be in Spain, <HI>after what I expe|rienced at Madrid.</HI> Be plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent my compliments to the Chevalier <HI>Bour|goine,</HI> I hope he will excu&s;e my not writing to him; as, the la&s;t po&s;t, I had &s;o violent a return of my quartan, that my few lines to you were not fini&s;hed without &s;ome extraordinary efforts: Dr. <HI>Craig</HI>'s remedy, has however, again proved efficacious: (de&s;ire Peter to correct that orthography.)

<P>YOUR omi&s;&s;ion to an&s;wer my letters on &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an emergency, I confe&s;s &s;urprizes me, and would have been productive of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;equences, had not the timely genero&s;ity of Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> relieved me. My expences &s;ince my arrival at this place have amounted to near 260 <HI>dollars;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> has fur|ni&s;hed me with 100 for the campaign. It is indeed a moderate, a very moderate allowance, con&s;idering my &s;ituation:&mdash;I am obliged to keep a &s;ervant at &s;even dol|lars and a half a month; and, when incamped, mu&s;t maintain him as well as my|&s;elf, at my private expence. Should we be&s;ent to America, I &s;hall, too probably, be reduced to a &s;tate of dependence on my companions; how far I may tru&s;t even their genero&s;ity is dubious.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A LETTER which I this day received from Mr. Harri&s;on informs me, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e and concern, that your Excellency has prote&s;ted my bills!&mdash; your long &s;ilence is no longer a my&s;tery. I mean not to reproach you; your conduct may not de&s;erve the appellation of ungenerous or cruel; it is, indeed, unexpected. Permit me, &s;ir, to recal your attention to &s;ome circum&s;tances which both preceded and were &s;ub&s;equent to my engaging in this unfortunate enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t communicated to you my intention of making this campaign, you endeavored to di&s;&s;uaded me from it for two rea&s;ons&mdash;"as being contrary to the <HI>de&s;igns of my friends,</HI> and from <HI>per&s;onal danger:</HI>" For the fir&s;t I look upon my&s;elf to be re&s;pon&s;ible: judge whether I ought to have been influenced by the latter.&mdash;
<PB N="24" REF="019735_0026_0FACA54224D5A060">You never objected the expence 'till after I had received the permi&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty; 'twas then too late! My reputation, my honor, my all was at &s;take!&mdash; Why, in the name of humanity, why was not that mentioned, even hinted in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, before? I expo&s;tulated with you, warmly perhaps, I hope not indecently, on that &s;ubject, as well as with regard to the credit you allowed me on Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on;</HI> that, you re&s;tricted to <HI>&s;ix months pay for a captain of foot!</HI> This, &s;ir, as I afterwards informed you, was a fatal regulation for me: a captain of cavalry in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice has forty reals a day, and forage; a volunteer aid de camp, in which capacity I have the honor to &s;erve, has nothing and pays both for his hor&s;e and forage.</P>
<P>As to the 150 dollars on Mr. H. you a&s;&s;ured me it was not from &s;u&s;picions of my making an improper u&s;e of <HI>unlimited credit,</HI> but to ju&s;tify you to my friends, &s;hould they di&s;approve my conduct; that it was by no means your de&s;ign I &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; on the contrary, &s;hould that happen, I might draw on you as my exigencies &s;hould require. 'Twas, &s;ir, in con&s;equence of this, that I ventured to draw on Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on.</HI> I appeal to him whether I expended one penny unnece&s;&s;a|rily.</P>
<P><HI>Your conduct, perhaps, is influenced by apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;s, as you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s an opulent fortune.&mdash;I ear not, fir;</HI> 'tis true, I have obligations to &s;ome few valuable friends, but they &s;hall never &s;uffer: The genero&s;ity of an affectionate parent and a worthy decea&s;ed relation, <HI>have left me above dependence.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your letter of the 8th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I have paid Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> the money he advanced to you, as far as my letter of credit to him in your favor extended. Your bill upon me, <HI>drawn without my con|&s;ent,</HI> for a &s;um beyond the limits of that credit, I did not accept.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="019735_0027_0FACA542E3260430">
It is true, &s;ir, that I was &s;o far the cau&s;e of your leaving your friends, as my offer|ing to receive you into <HI>my family, care, and protection, in ca&s;e they &s;hould think proper to &s;end you to Europe,</HI> might have been inducements. This offer was di&s;intere&s;ted, and in my opinion as generous as my circum&s;tances and my duty to tho&s;e who &s;tand in the neare&s;t of all relations to me, would permit.</P>
<P>I then under&s;tood that your principal funds con&s;i&s;ted in the genero&s;ity of a wor|thy uncle, and one or two other friends; and I had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;upplies with which they might be willing to furni&s;h you, would, tho' equal to your nece&s;&s;ary expences, be neverthele&s;s &s;uch, as to <HI>require</HI> a con&s;tant attention to oeconomy; for I remember, that on &s;peaking with Colonel Fleming, &s;hortly before I left Philadelphia, about the probability of your following me, he told me that <HI>the difficulty of providing funds</HI> for the purpo&s;e, would be the <HI>principal ob&s;tacle;</HI> but this being a matter without my province, I could only de&s;ire him to a&s;&s;ure your friends, <HI>that in ca&s;e they &s;hould conclude to &s;end you, they might depend on my taking care of you.</HI> Hence I have con&s;tanly thought my&s;elf particularly bound, ever &s;ince your arrival, to take care that <HI>the&s;e funds,</HI> &s;o far as the di&s;po&s;ition of them might depend upon me, &s;hould be confined to their <HI>proper objects,</HI> and not diverted to &s;uch <HI>foreign ones</HI> as might, from time to time, &s;pring up in a warm and youthful fancy. I neither con&s;idered my&s;elf, nor did I &s;uppo&s;e that you would con&s;ider me, merely in the light of <HI>your bancker.</HI>&mdash;I expected to receive you under my <HI>direction,</HI> as well as <HI>protection;</HI> and that the expences, which your friends might be willing to be at on your account, &s;hould be regulated, in a certain degree, by <HI>my judgment,</HI> as well as <HI>your's.</HI></P>
<P>A moment's reflection ought to convince you, that <HI>no &s;elfi&s;h</HI> con&s;iderations in|fluenced me to undertake this ta&s;k. You was repre&s;ented to me as a young gentleman who&s;e talents and di&s;po&s;ition merited better opportunities of improve|ment than tho&s;e you had; and my regard for a ri&s;ing genius oppo&s;ed by difficul|ties, prompted me to patronize you, <HI>tho' a perfect &s;tranger to me,</HI> and no way con|nected with any of my family.</P>
<P>With this view it was that my hou&s;e and patronage were at fir&s;t offered to you, and hence it was that I have, from time to time, taken the liberty of advi&s;ing you with re&s;pect to the books and &s;tudies mo&s;t proper for you, in my opinion, to read and to pur&s;ue. You may remember al&s;o, that in a conver&s;ation about your ex|pences, brought on by Mr. De Francy's letter, I &s;hewed you your uncle's letter to me, remarking it's too great want of particularity on that head, and expre&s;&s;ing my wi&s;hes that it had been more explicit; for that as I was ignorant of the ex|tent of your funds, it was impo&s;&s;ible to determine the proper extent of your ex|pences, which I thought the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, in my judgment, the plan of your education &s;hould be more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, in proportion as you might be more or le&s;s able to &s;upport the expence of it. I mention the&s;e circum&s;tances to remind you, that I early con&s;idered my&s;elf in another light than that of your <HI>bancker.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="019735_0028_0FACA543A6884DB8">
When you fir&s;t mentioned to me your plan of going a volunteer with the Duke de Crillon, and reque&s;ted me to &s;peak to him upon the &s;ubject, I well remember that <HI>the expence of it</HI> became one of the topics of the conver&s;ation which then en&s;ued; and I am <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI> you &s;hould forget that you urged the <HI>cheapne&s;s</HI> of the plan as an argument to reconcile me to it. You ob&s;erved particularly to it, that if you &s;hould be admitted into the Duke's family, you would have &s;carce any <HI>other expence</HI> than that of <HI>regimentals;</HI> and that it would not only be a more ex|peditious and agreable, but al&s;o a le&s;s <HI>expen&s;ive</HI> way of learning Spani&s;h, than that of going to a country village, as Mr. Vaughan had done, and as you would other|wi&s;e be al&s;o inclined to do.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of that, and all other conver&s;ations which I have ever had with you or others on the &s;ubject of this project, <HI>I pointedly di&s;approved of it;</HI> and tho' many rea&s;ons for my di&s;approbation were &s;ubmitted to your con&s;ideration, it &s;eems that all except two have e&s;caped your memory, viz. <HI>"as being contrary to the de&s;igns of your friends, and from per&s;ona! danger."</HI> For the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> you &s;ay, you looked upon your&s;elf to be re&s;pon&s;ible; and I will add, that &s;o far as I might be concerned in it, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as re&s;pon&s;ible both to your friends and to my own judgment.&mdash;As to the circum&s;tance of <HI>per&s;onal danger,</HI> you de&s;ire me to judge whether you ought to have been influenced by it? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forbear remarks on the repetition of this que&s;tion, it wants explanation, and you will find, that, as well as an an&s;wer to it, in the following paragraph of a letter I wrote you on this &s;ubject, the 15th June la&s;t, viz. "I know that you ought, and I advi&s;e you &s;teadily to follow wherever your duty may lead you <HI>without being deterred by danger, or evils of any kind whatever:</HI> and were it your duty to go on the propo&s;ed expedition, I &s;hould cea&s;e to e&s;teem you, if you &s;uffered <HI>any per&s;onal con&s;ideration</HI> to re&s;train you. You &s;eem to admit that your duty does not require you to take this &s;tep&mdash;and I think you will do well to con&s;ider how far it will <HI>authori&s;e</HI> it.&mdash;This is a delicate &s;ubject; and yet the relations you &s;tand in to your country, your family, and your friends, ought to be well weighted, before you embark in a mea&s;ure that may affect each of them. But you know my &s;entiments on all the&s;e points, having before dwelt minutely on them. All I can do, is to give you my advice&mdash;this I have done freely and candidly."</P>
<P>The objections you mention are only <HI>two</HI> of the rea&s;ons which I urged again&s;t your project&mdash;They were accompanied with tho&s;e others which naturally ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject, mu&s;t pre&s;ent them&s;elves to all who con&s;ider it with attention. It would be as unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate them now, as it proved u&s;ele&s;s to urge them at fir&s;t. Be&s;ides, the manner in which you refer to my objections, &s;eems to be more with a view of &s;hewing what they <HI>were not,</HI> than what they <HI>were</HI>&mdash;for if I under&s;tand you right, you mean to infer from the&s;e <HI>two</HI> being the <HI>&s;ole</HI> rea&s;ons for my di&s;&s;ent, that the <HI>expence</HI> of the plan could not have been one of them, and therefore that I ought either to have afterwards furni&s;hed you with <HI>as much</HI> money as you might have occa&s;ion for in the execution of it, or have told you that I
<PB N="27" REF="019735_0029_0FACA54462E09E90">would not &s;upply you with <HI>any.</HI>&mdash;There is a difference, &s;ir, between advancing <HI>no more</HI> at all, and advancing <HI>as much</HI> as a young gentleman may plea&s;e <HI>to a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for,</HI> beyond the probable extent of his funds.&mdash;There are al&s;o &s;ome matters of fact which I wi&s;h to recal to your memory; and that this may be done with le&s;s ri&s;que of mi&s;take and confu&s;ion, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider the whole time in which the bu&s;ine&s;s of this project was in agitation, as coming within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> periods:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The time which pa&s;&s;ed between your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mentioning it to me, and your acquainting me with your determination <HI>to per&s;i&s;t</HI> in pur&s;uing it, notwith|&s;tanding my di&s;approbation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The time which pa&s;&s;ed between this determination, and the grant of your reque&s;t by the court.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The time &s;ub&s;equent to the grant of your reque&s;t, including your departure for, and arrival at Cadiz.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>During the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e periods I flattered my&s;elf with being able to convince you, that your project, being ill adapted to <HI>your &s;ituation,</HI> and little calculated to promote your <HI>proper</HI> views, ought to be relinqui&s;hed&mdash;it was then &s;ufficient only &s;o far to touch upon the matter of <HI>expence,</HI> as it gave occa&s;ion to <HI>general</HI> remarks. At <HI>that</HI> time it had not become rea&s;onable nor nece&s;&s;ary to tell you, <HI>I would not advance you any money in ca&s;e you per&s;i&s;ted,</HI> for I could not pre&s;ume that <HI>you would per&s;i&s;t again&s;t my advice and con&s;ent.</HI> Such a <HI>threat</HI> would have been too har&s;h and indelicate, to have had a good effect; and would have been very di&s;tant from the manner in which I always had treated, and always wi&s;hed to treat you.</P>
<P>On the commencement of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> period, the &s;tate of the whole affair was changed. The moment you cea&s;ed to re&s;pect my opinion and con&s;ent, it became <HI>your</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, and cea&s;ed to be <HI>mine,</HI> to provide for the means of executing a &s;cheme you had <HI>re&s;olved to adopt again&s;t my approbation.</HI> So that if I had after|wards ob&s;erved the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence re&s;pecting the expence, and all other articles connected with this project, you would have had no &s;ort of right to complain.</P>
<P>But, &s;ir, altho' my advice had hitherto been neglected, I again took an occa&s;ion of troubling you with it; for on hearing that the Duke had, on your application, con&s;ented to take you into his family, provided you could obtain the leave of the court to go, I thought it a good opportunity of calling your attention to a matter, about which your expectations appeared to be rather too &s;anguine, I mean <HI>the expence.</HI> I advi&s;ed you, in &s;o many words, immediately to take &s;uch explicit arrangements with the Duke, as that <HI>no matters of expence</HI> might be le&s;t una&s;certained, in ca&s;e you &s;hould obtain the permi&s;&s;ion in que&s;tion. I expected that the propriety of this advice would certainly &s;trike you; and not doubting but that you would mention to me the re&s;ult of your conver&s;ation with him on this &s;ubject, I &s;u&s;pected it would afford me <HI>new arguments</HI> to prevail upon you to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But this advice, however proper, met with <HI>no attention:</HI> You applied to the Court for leave to accompany the Duke, and permitted him to &s;et out for Cadiz,
<PB N="28" REF="019735_0030_0FACA5452F1C16D0">without having &s;aid a word to him about the expence you might expect to incur.</P>
<P>Here aro&s;e the following que&s;tion of prudence, viz. Whether it would be be&s;t for me to tell you plainly, that I would not &s;upply you with any money, in ca&s;e you &s;hould obtain leave to go, and thereby oblige you to abandon, from <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> a &s;cheme which you could not be per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h from <HI>rea&s;on.</HI>&mdash;. On con&s;idering this que&s;tion, I &s;aw that the nece&s;&s;ity and con&s;equently the propriety of this &s;tep, mu&s;t depend entirely on the <HI>probability</HI> of your obtaining the leave of the Court. A little time and con&s;ideration convinced me that probability was decidedly again&s;t your obtaining it: For,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You was a prote&s;tant, and it was &s;aid that no officers of that profe&s;&s;ion were to be found in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You was a citizen of North-America, who&s;e independence had not been acknowledged by this court.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I had made no &s;ecret of my di&s;approbation, and in a letter of the 17th June, informed the mini&s;ter of &s;tate, that I could take no part in your application, the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me by your friends, as well as my <HI>prive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te judgment,</HI> oppo&s;ing it.</ITEM>

<P>The conclu&s;ions, deducible from the&s;e circum&s;tances, need not be &s;pecified&mdash; The language of them made the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion upon you, that it did upon me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it was not long before we both became per&s;uaded that your application would prove fruitle&s;s, and in all probability die away without further notice.</P>
<P>There not being therefore the lea&s;t appearance of nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;tep in que&s;tion, it would have been very improper to take it, e&s;pecially as it would have unavoida|bly exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea in your brea&s;t, &s;en&s;ations and feelings very de&s;tructive to that confi|dence in my friendly attention, without which I could expect to be of very little u&s;e to you.

Be&s;ides, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ere&s;ted motives</HI> had never found a place among tho&s;e which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my conduct towards you, it would have been imprudent, by a mea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> capable of &s;uch a con&s;truction, to have given you rea&s;on to impute to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;iderations, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;ition which proceeded from the <HI>pure&s;t principles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;hip and candor.</HI></P>
<P>We were never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hele&s;s mi&s;taken in our conjectures as to the improbability of your obtaining the permi&s;&s;ion you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollicited, without entering into the rea&s;ons which, it &s;eems, prevailed with the court, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, very ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x|pectedly to us both, it was granted.</P>
<P>Here the la&s;t period begin. The Duke had gone to Cadiz, and you was to follow him immediately. You reflected that money would be nece&s;&s;ary, and
<PB N="29" REF="019735_0031_0FACA545E3C17140"><HI>you propo&s;ed to draw bills upon me, as your occa&s;ions &s;hould require,</HI> a&s;&s;uring me that you would only draw for as much as might be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;This propo&s;ition did not appear to me in the <HI>mo&s;t proper light,</HI> tho' I did not tell you &s;o. You had no money in my hands, nor any pecuniary demands upon me; and this was at lea&s;t an <HI>unu&s;ual</HI> way of applying for favors. As this project was adopted without my approbation, and pur&s;ued again&s;t my advice, I might with great ju&s;tice have refu&s;ed to furni&s;h any money for its execution. But, &s;ir, I &s;aw and I felt the unhappy dilemma to which you had imprudently brought your&s;elf; without money, you could not proceed, and without proceeding your would &s;uffer di&s;gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. I al&s;o con&s;idered what was due to your friends, whom you had thus &s;ubjected to the di&s;agreeable alternative of either &s;eeing you re&s;ign with an ill grace, or &s;ubmit to the expence of preventing it. The latter was more con&s;i&s;tent with my own judgment and feelings, and therefore I pre&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that <HI>they</HI> would al&s;o prefer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><HI>How much</HI> you &s;hould be allowed, then became a nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion, as well as a difficult one; becau&s;e in determining it, re&s;pect was to be had to the <HI>abilities and inclination</HI> of your friends, which I could only <HI>conjecture;</HI> to <HI>your ideas of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> which were very <HI>vague,</HI> and to your <HI>proper and unavoidable expences</HI> which we neither knew, nor had then time to enquire about; and which would greatly depend on your <HI>being admitted,</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> into the Duke's family. As to your pro|po&s;ition of <HI>unlimited credit,</HI> I declined it; not from doubts of the &s;incerity of your a&s;&s;urances, but becau&s;e it would in it&s;elf have been improper.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that either in the capacity of a volunteer-gentleman-&s;oldier, or as a volunteer aid de camp to the Duke, you might &s;pend a great deal of money, and yet &s;pend much le&s;s than &s;ome others in the &s;ame &s;ituation: But I could al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;um which, mea&s;ured by their fortunes, would be very moderate, would, if compared with <HI>your funds,</HI> be very extravagant: <HI>Their</HI> expences, therefore, could furni&s;h no rule for <HI>your's.</HI> Admitting al&s;o, for the &s;ake of argument, that this project was capable of affording you not only much plea&s;ure, but al&s;o much advantage; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the expence of it exceeded your means to &s;upply, your attention &s;hould return, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to objects more within the limits of your power and circum&s;tances. Had you followed my advice, and previou&s;ly a&s;certained the expences incident to the place promi&s;ed you by the Duke, your way would have been plain and obvious.</P>
<P>I had &s;everal months before written to your uncle <HI>to fix the &s;um</HI> beyond which he would not chu&s;e that your expences &s;hould extend, and I purpo&s;ed immedi|ately to repeat that reque&s;t, as his an&s;wer would relieve me from the ri&s;que of all differences with you on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject in future, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to make you &s;uch an allowance <HI>in the mean time,</HI> as I had rea&s;on to think fully adequate to <HI>your real wants,</HI> tho' perhaps not to <HI>your de&s;ires.</HI> For this, however, &s;ome <HI>ule</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary, and I could find none better than the allowances on which <HI>the Spani&s;h officers appeared to live decently.</HI> I thought that if you was enabled to
<PB N="30" REF="019735_0032_0FACA546A3C7F920">live in the &s;tile of a <HI>Spani&s;h captain of foot,</HI> until the in&s;tructions of your uncle &s;hould arrive, you would have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied. I therefore agreed to allow you <HI>the &s;ame pay,</HI> and to advance you the amount of it <HI>for &s;ix months.</HI> Over and above this, I agreed not only to pay off your little debts here, which I after|wards found to amount to fifty odd hard dollars, but al&s;o to furni&s;h you with mo|ney for your expences between this and Cadiz, and for regimentals, &amp;c. In &s;hort, I gave you at &s;etting out 127 pieces of eight <HI>in hand,</HI> and a credit on Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> for 150 more, which you accordingly received on your arrival. I al&s;o authori&s;ed you, <HI>in ca&s;e you &s;hould be taken pri&s;oner, and not otherwi&s;e,</HI> to draw upon me for &s;ufficient to relieve you from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which &s;uch an event might involve you. I acknowledge that you expo&s;tulated with me warmly, tho' not indecently, on the &s;ubject of this provi&s;ion, and that you was di&s;contented with it, tho' in my opinion, without rea&s;on. I thought it was doing as much as, all things con&s;idered, could prudently be done for you. I did not know how far your uncle might either find it convenient, or be di&s;po&s;ed to defray even the&s;e expences, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the amount of tho&s;e which he had already incurred on your account; and I thought it my duty to pay &s;ome regard to his convenience, as well as to your's.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This reque&s;t was afterwards repeated almo&s;t in the &s;ame words, in your letter of the 6th July, in which you al&s;o mention &s;ome articles of news, and inform me, that tho' your quartan had returned the la&s;t po&s;t-day, you was then recovered.</P>
<P>You now complain that the&s;e letters were never an&s;wered.&mdash;It is true, that tho' I have &s;ince written to you, viz. on the 10th day of September la&s;t, yet <HI>I never id take any notice of the&s;e letters.</HI></P>
<P>I have known many gentlemen with ten times your allowance, in daily di&s;tre&s;s for want of money; and yet it would not have been proper to indulge them with more.</P>
<P>You informed me, that unle&s;s your allowance <HI>was doubled,</HI> you might be infi|nitely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. This I knew to be very <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> but &s;till the in&s;ufficiency of
<PB N="31" REF="019735_0033_0FACA54764CF0110">your allowance for your <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> expences could not <HI>thence</HI> be argued. From what could I argue it? You mentioned no facts&mdash;you &s;ent me no e&s;timate&mdash; you did not a&s;&s;ign a &s;ingle rea&s;on for your apprehen&s;ions. You informed me, in|deed, that the expences of your journey, and others unavoidably to be incurred, greatly exceeded your expectations; but how was I to divine either the one or the other? or with what propriety could you expect that I would be guided by your opinion or apprehen&s;ions, further than they might <HI>appear</HI> to be well found|ed? &mdash;I would have encrea&s;ed your allowance, <HI>if evidently incompetent;</HI> but that incompetency was fir&s;t to be manife&s;ted. The obvious impropriety of &s;uch &s;um|mary, unexplained applications for money, <HI>in &s;uch ca&s;es,</HI> affords a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to them; and I &s;hould indeed have ill an&s;wered the expectations of your friends, if I could have given them no better rea&s;ons for advancing you money on their account, than that <HI>you had a&s;ked for it.</HI></P>
<P>Your reque&s;t to <HI>double your allowance,</HI> being accompanied with no facts or rea&s;ons to &s;hew its propriety, I could continue to judge of it only from the general appearance of things. I con&s;idered that you had &s;et out with an ample &s;upply of cloaths, and with money to purcha&s;e regimentals, &amp;c. That you had al&s;o been furni&s;hed with money for your journey, and thereby enabled to enter the Duke's family with <HI>&s;ix months pay of a Captain untouched in your pocket.</HI></P>
<P>I con&s;idered that your admi&s;&s;ion into his family and to his table, had actually realized tho&s;e expectations, from which you had before argued the <HI>cheapne&s;s</HI> of your plan; and that tho' you might a&s;&s;ociate with gentlemen of <HI>fortune</HI> and <HI>ex|pence,</HI> yet that, not being equal to them in the <HI>one,</HI> you ought not to follow them in the <HI>other.</HI> I could perceive without any difficulty, that if you meant to keep pace in expence with many of your companions, your allowance would prove very inadequate, and I had my fears that this in a certain degree might be the ca&s;e; for tho' you had been at the expence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This included the whole expence for hor&s;es to Cadiz.</NOTE> of an order for po&s;t-hor&s;es to carry you from hence to Cadiz, yet it &s;eems the "<HI>extreme heat of the weather obliged</HI> you and a fellow-traveller to <HI>hire a coach</HI> on the way." This, no doubt, was a more <HI>agreeable</HI> way of going, and yet (unle&s;s made nece&s;&s;ary by &s;ickne&s;s, which I have not heard was the ca&s;e) it was travelling rather like a gentleman who needed not to regard expence, than like one who&s;e funds did not admit of &s;uch indulgences. You may &s;ay, perhaps, that it made no great difference in the expence; if &s;o, it was a &s;lender rea&s;on for encrea&s;ing your allowance&mdash;and if, on the contrary, it was con&s;iderable, it ought to have been avoided.</P>
<P>Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, at this <HI>late</HI> day, you inform me that you are obliged to find not only your own hor&s;e, but even forage for him. This is undoubtedly a good ar|gument in favor of increa&s;ing your allowance; but &s;urely, &s;ir, you could not ex|pect that I &s;hould be influenced by this circum&s;tance, before it had come to my knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="019735_0034_0FACA548247DB878">
Thus, &s;ir, I have, by a full and temperate an&s;wer, treated your letter with a degree of re&s;pect, which it would not probably have received from many others.&mdash; I forbear making any remarks on its improprieties, being per&s;uaded that they are to be con&s;idered, rather as the incautious violences of a generous mind, revolting again&s;t narrow, tho' nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints, than as the virulent efforts of a bad di&s;|po&s;ition, to give unmerited pain.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Port Mahon,</HI> <DATE>7th of <HI>December,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 26th of <HI>October</HI> reached me ye&s;terday.&mdash;To begin with it&mdash;</P>
<P>That your offers to patronize me <HI>were generous and di&s;intere&s;ted,</HI> I &s;hall ever acknowledge with <HI>gra itude.</HI> Can you &mdash; that there was any de&s;ign in the acceptance of them to prejudice "you," or the neare&s;t of all relations to you?" The thought's injurious.&mdash;That an oeconomical attention was to be ob&s;erved in the regulation of my expences, is certain: from this, &s;ir, I flatter my&s;elf I have not deviated. Sent at a very early time of life to France, <HI>with letters of unlimited credit,</HI> my con&s;tant endeavors were to live with frugality and decency My wor|thy uncle had permitted me to &s;pend &s;ome months at Paris (con&s;ult your letter from him) a tender regard for his <HI>"convenience"</HI> induced me to relinqui&s;h it as too expen&s;ive a plan. You your&s;elf, &s;ir, have expre&s;s'd your &s;atisfaction of my conduct on that head, as well as my expences in general, till <HI>"this affair."</HI></P>
<P>That my re&s;ources are principally from the genero&s;ity of an uncle and other friends, is not altogether fact. I am, &s;ir, a younger &s;on of an honorable family: the profu&s;ion of my father, too certainly left his de&s;cendants by his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> marriage in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. At his union with my mother, <HI>her</HI> father prudently di&s;po&s;ed of her fortune in &s;uch a manner that it could only be inherited by her children: the death of my father entitled her to a third part of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anded pro|perty, during life, that &s;he re&s;igned in con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deration of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;maller <HI>real</HI> e&s;tate, which &s;he generou&s;ly &s;ettled upon me at her &s;econd marriage; the one half to be &s;old, and which has actually been &s;old by my uncle to defray the expences of my education; the other half to devolve to me at the death of her|&s;elf and hu&s;band. Some years pa&s;t a di&s;tant relation died and left a valuable tract of land of about 10,000 acres, to be divided between four brothers-in-law any my&s;elf: this, Sir! with the land and &s;ome &s;laves which I &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s at my mother's decea&s;e, will &s;urely enable me to indemnify my uncle for generou&s;ly advancing me the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums for my travels, &amp;c. &amp;c. even <HI>"after this affair."</HI></P>
<P>A reliance on the &s;incerity of your friend&s;hip, joined to the remon&s;trances of Mr. Adams, prevailed on him to &s;end me to Europe, to your <HI>care and "direction,"</HI> provided with no funds but a letter to you&mdash;'tis not &s;ufficiently explicit&mdash;you &s;ay perhaps &s;o: 'twas intended as <HI>reque&s;t</HI> to a <HI>friend,</HI> not an <HI>order</HI> on a "Banker." If he expected that I &s;hould only be received into your hou&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c. how in the name of heaven was I to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted?&mdash;think better on it. I &s;till affirm that you was the cau&s;e of my leaving my friends and country: 'till your offers, my uncle never entertained the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of &s;ending me to Europe? I never con&s;idered you in the light of my "Banker!" Sir! you wrong both your|&s;elf and me by &s;o degrading an appellation&mdash;you have no money of mine in your hands:&mdash;I was confided &s;olely to your friend&s;hip:&mdash;Could my worthy uncle
<PB N="35" REF="019735_0037_0FACA54A64C99658">but know that for &s;ome inaccuracy in his letter, I am at this moment reduced to &s;ell my cloaths for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; what would be his feelings?</P>
<P>I find you have mi&s; under&s;tood &s;ome parts of my letter: in my fir&s;t conver&s;ation in regard to this expedition, <HI>I certainly did mention the expence:</HI> but remember, Sir! you was far from <HI>objecting</HI> to it:&mdash;I again affirm it!&mdash;you agreed with me, that in all <HI>probability</HI> the expence would not be <HI>con&s;iderable,</HI> we were both deceived!&mdash; as a proof be plea&s;ed <HI>to examine my letter to you of the 15th of June, where you will find this paragraph:</HI></P>
<P><Q>My pre&s;ent object is the attainment of the Spani&s;h language; the alternative is to retire to &s;ome village, or &s;pend a few months in the army; the latter is in|finitely more plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, le&s;s <HI>expen&s;ive,</HI> and more con&s;utent with my future plans of life.</Q></P>
<P>Neither in your reply, nor in conver&s;ation, did you ever &s;eem to think the expence very <HI>important,</HI> 'till my permi&s;&s;ion was obtained.</P>
<P>Our different rea&s;ons had not e&s;caped my memory, Sir! I only mentioned the two alluded to as tho&s;e of mo&s;t con&s;equence: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that as your ac|quie&s;cence in my opinion with regard to the expence induced me to per&s;evere in it beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of retracting, I think it afterwards became an obligation upon you to &s;upply me with a &s;ufficiency to go through with it in a <HI>decent</HI> manner; there is a difference, Sir, between advancing a <HI>competency,</HI> or barely enough to carry a Gentleman to the &s;cene of action, where he mu&s;t either <HI>&s;tarve,</HI> or di&s;honor him&s;elf eternally by <HI>ignominious</HI> retreat. As to the propriety of your objecting the expence in the fir&s;t or &s;econd period, which you &s;tate, it depended entirely on your own judgment. I remember your de&s;iring me to come to an explana|tion with Crillon about it; but here, Sir! &s;ome circum&s;tances have e&s;caped your memory: you may very unju&s;tly accu&s;e me of neglecting your advice: I waited on him when he informed me that he had mentioned the affair to Count de Florida Blanca, and very candidly declared his belief of its being impracticable.&mdash;I com|municated it to you, and as you ob&s;erve, we very &s;oon agreed that the affair was fini&s;hed and would die away: why then do you accu&s;e me of permitting the Duke to &s;et out for Cadiz, without &s;aving a word to him of expences which he had de|declared, and <HI>both</HI> of us believed would never be incurred? <HI>after our various con|ver&s;ations, and my letter of the 15th of June,</HI> I am &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee this &s;entence in vom letter,&mdash;</P>
<P>"But the warmth and enthu&s;ia&s;m in&s;pired by a de&s;ire of &s;haring the eclat of a brilliant coup de main hurried you too far." <HI>I mu&s;t refer to the afore&s;aid letter, and to &s;ome "minute particulars" therein.</HI> Remember your own opinion on that &s;ubject&mdash;my &s;ituation. Remember my la&s;t reque&s;t, and your promi&s;e to ju&s;tify me to my friends, to inform them generou&s;ly of the many unfore&s;een delays which impeded my application, and obliged me to incur heavy expence, viz. the journey to Cadiz, which I flattered my&s;elf to have made with the Duke: <HI>was not that letter of the 15th of June written at your own reque&s;t, to &s;erve as a proof
<PB N="36" REF="019735_0038_0FACA54B23C04860">of tho&s;e "minute particulars" in defence of both our characters?</HI> is all this &s;o &s;oon forgotten? I find my&s;elf de&s;cribed by you as a &s;harper, ba&s;ely endeavouring to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raud of your money, tied down to the &s;trict limits of your letter though given under a &s;uppo&s;ition of its being a competency; my word was not &s;ufficient to the contrary! what mu&s;t Harri&s;on think of me? I ye&s;terday had a letter from him? he declines a&s;&s;i&s;ting me any farther! I cannot blame him; I was wrong to a&s;k it; the pro&s;pect of want obliged me! I have deceived him, but I was deceived my&s;elf! I told him that your re&s;tricting me to 150 dollars was from a per&s;ua&s;ion that it would be enough; that a proof of its in&s;ufficiency would in|duce you to extend it; in &s;hort gave him every a&s;&s;urance that he would &s;uffer no inconvenience from it; I believe it, Sir! You &s;u&s;pect me of &s;pending my money by a ridiculous vanity of being thought equal to men of ten times my fortune? you ought to have known me better.

<HEAD>No. 26. FROM MR. JAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Madrid,</HI> <DATE>December 29, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS &s;ilence is &s;ometimes liable to be mi&s;interpreted, it is proper that I &s;hould &s;o far reply to your letter of the 7th in&s;tant, as to correct &s;ome of the principal er|rors in it.</P>
<P>I have never thought nor intimated, that my offers to patronize you were ac|cepted with de&s;ign to prejudice me, and con&s;equently your remark on that head is premature.</P>
<P>It is true that I did approve of your not going to Paris, and (as far as I could judge) "of your expences in general, till this affair"&mdash;ju&s;tice demands this ad|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;I am ignorant of your having had <HI>unlimited credit in France.</HI></P>
<P>That you came to Europe, de&s;titute of other funds than a letter to me, <HI>I did not know.</HI> I expected, on your arrival, and from time to time afterwards, to furni&s;h money for your nece&s;&s;ary expences; but, I al&s;o expected, that funds had been, or would be provided, to reimbur&s;e the&s;e advances from time to time.</P>
<P>Whether your Uncle had any thoughts of &s;ending you to Europe until after my offers, is a &s;ubject on which I have no other information than <HI>your letter.</HI> I know that your Guardian, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> had &s;uch thoughts.&mdash;It was from him I fir&s;t <HI>heard</HI> of you, and it was from his account of you, and his &s;ignifying a de&s;ire that I &s;hould take you with me, under my immediate care, that the&s;e offers were made.</P>
<P>I never con&s;idered your Uncle's letter in the light of an order on a Banker and am at a lo&s;s to conceive what &s;hould have mi&s;led you into &s;uch an opinion. My remark on the want of preci&s;ion in that letter, aro&s;e from his having omitted to limit your expences, and having thereby left me expo&s;ed to di&s;agreeable differ|ences with you on that head.</P>
<P>I never did concur with you in opinion as to the expences which would proba|bly attend your project; nor did I ever give you rea&s;on to think &s;o. I did in|deed agree <HI>that if, as you flattered your&s;elf,</HI> the Duke &s;hould receive you in &s;uch a manner into his family, as to leave you expo&s;ed to no other expences than for cloaths and pocket money, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e expences would not be con&s;iderable; but <HI>I doubted this being the ca&s;e; I told you &s;o;</HI> and in order to reduce the matter to a certainty, I advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed you to a&s;certain it by &s;peaking fully to the Duke on the &s;ub|ject. I gave you this advice, immediately on being informed that he had promi&s;ed to take you into his family, and not after the delays of the Court and other cir|cum&s;tances had rendered it improbable that your reque&s;t for leave to accompany him, would be granted.</P>
<P>But admitting for a moment, that I really did acquie&s;ce in your opinion of the&s;e expences, the inferences you attempt to draw from thence are neverthele&s;s falla|cious.&mdash;Suppo&s;e that my Nephew now with me, &s;hould a&s;k my con&s;ent to go to

<P><HI>You refer me for the rea&s;ons which induced you to go on this expedition, to your letter of the 15th of June, and "to &s;ome minute particulars therein:" and al&s;o to my opinion on them. I well remember the contents of that letter, but I know of no other opinion on tho&s;e minute particulars, con&s;idered as rea&s;ons for your project,</HI> than what I thus expre&s;&s;ed in my <HI>an&s;wer to that letter,</HI> viz. "That in my opinion you ought not at any rate to let them drive you to &s;uch extremities." But I am &s;till of opinion that you was more &s;trongly urged into this project<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the imagined brilli|ancy of it, than by any &s;erious con&s;iderations; although you have doubtle&s;s per|&s;uaded your&s;elf to think other wi&s;e.</P>
<P>You remind me of your reque&s;t and a promi&s;e on my part to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> you to your friends. I did not promi&s;e to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> you in this affair, to your friends, nor to any body el&s;e. I promi&s;ed to &s;tate the facts fully and candidly to your friends&mdash;I have done &s;o, in a letter to your Uncle of the 25th of June la&s;t; and that letter will &s;hew my regard both for you and for truth.</P>
<P>It is very true, that your letter to me of the 15th of June, was written at my reque&s;t, <HI>I made that re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue&s;t, becau&s;e I thought the matters it contains, and which you had before mentioned to me in conver&s;ation, were &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to be re|duced to writing, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uidence of them thereby the better pre&s;erved. I remem|ber this very well, nor was there any thing in that tran&s;action which I have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t wi&s;h either to forget or conceal.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing of my having de&s;cribed you as a &s;harper.</P>
<P>You <HI>now</HI> &s;ay, that the mo&s;t prevalent rea&s;on with you to make this campaign, was a firm belief that I was of your opinion with regard to its utility; "and that it appeared to you that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed you rather to have acted contrary to the coun&s;el which the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> delicacy of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ation with regard to you, obliged me to give." This is an ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of intelligent which! never expected to have received.&mdash; Your <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> &s;eem to have had a very uncommon degree of influence on your <HI>belief.</HI></P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment that you mentioned this plan to me, and throughout the cour&s;e of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> had with your, or others, on the &s;ub|ject of it; I not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> an unwire and indi&s;creet one, but I uni|formly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and pointedly <HI>gave that opinion of it</HI> to you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them.</P>

In my letter to the Mini&s;ter of Start of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of June, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> told him, thus "not only the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me by your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;orting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it was contract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> In my letter to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, I mentioned that your embarking in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, it &s;eems, that you picked up a contrary idea in &s;ome conver&s;ations with me, and you adduce <HI>two</HI> in&s;tances as affording &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons for your adopting it.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that on your expatiating on the advantages which would accrue to you from this project&mdash;you &s;ay I an&s;wered "yes, if you e&s;cape with whole bones, or &s;ome &s;uch remark."&mdash;The matter you appear to allude to might have been more accurately &s;tated*.</P>
<P>Among the advantages which you thought would re&s;ult from this project, you often in&s;i&s;ted upon this, viz.&mdash;That by bringing you acquainted with many gen|teel people in the army, it would, on your return to Madrid, facilitate your form|ing many re&s;pectable and agreeable acquaintances.&mdash;It is true I admitted that this might be the ca&s;e;&mdash;and I al&s;o ob&s;erved, <HI>at the &s;ame time,</HI> that &s;uppo&s;ing it to be an advantage, yet that it was not of &s;ufficient importance to render it advi&s;eable for you to encounter the hazards and inconveniences of a voyage and expedition who&s;e object was then unknown, and which many conjectured would be to South America; from whence you might not return in le&s;s than two or three years, if at all.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> in&s;tance you adduce is, that I expre&s;&s;ed my apprehen&s;ions to you one day, that a certain Gentleman "would be glad to have a handle again&s;t me, either by imputing my <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to a <HI>wrong motive,</HI> or el&s;e making me from <HI>politi|cal rea&s;ons</HI> act contrary to what <HI>my duty obliged me.</HI></P>
<P>I remember this circum&s;tance, and you have &s;tated it right in &s;ub&s;tance. But it &s;eems to me that this circum&s;tance, in&s;tead of leading you to conclude and be|lieve, that I was <HI>in favor</HI> of your &s;cheme, not only afforded proof of any oppo|&s;ition to it, but al&s;o of my being influenced to that oppo&s;ition by a &s;en&s;e of duty, and not by <HI>political rea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>But although I oppo&s;ed your plan upon the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted principles,</HI> yet as experience had taught me to expect little, fair or friendly, from the Gentleman in que&s;tion, I did apprehend that he would endeavour to infu&s;e an opinion of my do|ing it from motives of a <HI>private or per&s;onal</HI> nature; and though I do not remember to have explained this <HI>&s;o you,</HI> yet I was not without &s;u&s;picions, that he would af|fect to a&s;cribe it to a de&s;ire of detaining you as <HI>a private Secretary</HI> in the room of Mr. <HI>Liningston,</HI> who you know had at that very time, &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed to re|turn to America; or to <HI>a di&s;inclination</HI> to make the extraordinary advances of monkey, which the expences of this project might demand&mdash;and the fact is, that this certain Gentleman did in&s;inuate <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you,</HI> that I had <HI>ether rea&s;ons</HI> for my oppo&s;i|tion that the&s;e which I had a&s;&s;igned <HI>to you and others.</HI> I did further apprehend that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Gentleman would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ee, and to draw me, if po&s;&s;ible, into
<PB N="43" REF="019735_0045_0FACA550638FE5A8">incon&s;i&s;tency of finally con&s;enting from <HI>political rea&s;ons,</HI> to a mea&s;ure which I had before declared that <HI>my judgment,</HI> as well as my duty to you and your friends, for|bid me to agree to, or countenance.&mdash;For although that Gentleman had <HI>at fir&s;t warmly oppo&s;ed</HI> your intention of going with the Duke, yet when he found that it became <HI>popular,</HI> he profe&s;&s;ed to be convinced of its utility, and even <HI>&s;timulated you</HI> to per&s;evere in it.</P>
<P>And although that Gentleman had, without any re&s;pect to my &s;entiments, open|ly patronized this project, evidently with a view to draw me into the abovemen|tioned incon&s;i&s;tency, <HI>he advi&s;ed you</HI> to &s;olicit my permi&s;&s;ion, <HI>for him to &s;peak to</HI> the Mini&s;ter of State <HI>in favor</HI> of your application, pretending that without my con|&s;ent, it would not be proper or delicate for him to interfere&mdash;but this &s;nare did not &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>That &s;ame Gentleman perceiving that the Spaniards, (among whom he had again&s;t his better knowledge, and not for the be&s;t purpo&s;es, repre&s;ented you as a young Gentleman of an opulent fortune) were plea&s;ed with your plan of going a Volunteer in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, expatiated much and often on its advantages, and treated my oppo&s;ition to it with an <HI>air of my&s;tery,</HI> calculated to infu&s;e the &s;ame &s;u&s;|picion into others <HI>which eh expre&s;&s;ed to you,</HI> viz. that I had <HI>other rea&s;ons</HI> for my oppo&s;ition than tho&s;e which I a&s;&s;igned to you.&mdash;What the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;hould be, he never to my knowledge explained, but left you and others to your own conjectures. Hence the propriety of my conduct upon that occa&s;ion, was <HI>drawn into que&s;tion,</HI> as well as <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;I found my&s;elf expo&s;ed by this oppo&s;ition, to illiberal doubts and invidious &s;urmi&s;es.&mdash;And the pain of &s;uch a &s;ituation naturally afforded in|ducements to relieve my&s;elf from it, by withdrawing this oppo&s;ition. The&s;e in|ducements were the <HI>political rea&s;ons</HI> which I apprehended that this &s;ame Gentlemen wi&s;hed to make me &s;ubmit to act from, and be governed by.</P>
<P>I, neverthele&s;s, preferred obeying the obligations of what I thought my duty, to the temporary conveniences of deviating from it; for I do repeat, and &s;hall <HI>as long as I live</HI> declare, that I am not con&s;cious of having ever in thought approved, or by word or deed led you to think, that I approved of this project.&mdash;On the con|trary, I did con&s;tantly, openly and &s;trongly <HI>object to it,</HI> and endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade you from it.&mdash;I never harboured in my heart the mo&s;t di&s;tant wi&s;h that you would act contrary to that advice, nor ever gave you <HI>the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a rea&s;on to e&s;pou&s;e &s;uch an opinion.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL endeavor to an&s;wer your letter of the 29th December, as coolly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately as the intruding reflections on my &s;ituation will permit.</P>
<P>My credit in France was for my <HI>expences,</HI> the regulation of which was left to <HI>my prudence.</HI> That I had no funds in Europe but my uncle's letter to you, I have repeatedly declared, particularly in our conver&s;ation about <HI>de Francy</HI>'s affair, and in &s;ettling my little accounts with Col. <HI>Livingston,</HI> at his return from Bordeaux. <HI>That my uncle will find expedients to reimbur&s;e your advances, cannot be doubted:</HI> The expre&s;s methods I know not, and have <HI>often</HI> told you &s;o! He did not explain it to me before my departure, nor have I <HI>ever bad</HI> the lea&s;t intelligence from him &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> is not my guardian; con&s;equently, whatever plans of educations he might form for me could only be the wellwi&s;hes of a di&s;intere&s;ted friend. Your frequent repetition of the word <HI>banker,</HI> in your letter of 26th October, occa&s;ioned the ob&s;ervation of which you expre&s;s &s;urpri&s;e. I mu&s;t &s;till in&s;i&s;t on your con|currence in my opinion with regard to the expence; at lea&s;t your extreme delicacy in <HI>not objecting</HI> it, betrayed me into a <HI>belief</HI> of your acquie&s;cences, and that fatal error, by urging me to <HI>per&s;evere,</HI> has reduced me to inextricable mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>Your advice about arrangements with <HI>Crillon,</HI> was <HI>precedent</HI> to his promi&s;e of receiving me into his family: He reque&s;ted me to wait a <HI>verbal</HI> an&s;wer to any let|ter, and in the interim mentioned it to the mini&s;ter; during this interval, your coun&s;el was given, but the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and indeed <HI>only</HI> time I &s;aw him afterwards, he candidly informed me that my reque&s;t was impracticable; though &s;hould it be granted, he would with plea&s;ure receive me into his hou&s;ehold. <HI>His</HI> declaration, Sir, cru&s;hed my hopes, and not the <HI>&s;ub&s;equent delays of the court,</HI> which <HI>we both</HI> regarded only as little &s;trokes of fine&s;&s;e to let the affair die away.</P>
<P>Your &s;uppo&s;ition with regard to your nephew, is not entirely je&s;t; his early age confines him to objects le&s;s a&s;piring than tho&s;e which ought to influence me:&mdash; I am arrived at a period when I ought to think (in the vulgar phra&s;e) of <HI>making my way in the world</HI>&mdash;to <HI>learn Spani&s;h,</HI> was not the only advantage which allured me to this dangerous enterprize; <HI>one</HI> among&s;t many others was to attain the great object of my voyage to Europe, viz.

<P><HI>The preceding letters are the only ones which pa&s;&s;ed between Mr.</HI> Jay <HI>and Mr.</HI> Littlepage, <HI>prior to his return from</HI> Minorca, <HI>which was the middle or towards the latter end of</HI> April.</P>

<P>To prevent all <HI>further</HI> di&s;putes about the <HI>quantum</HI> of &s;upplies, Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> told him that the amount of them, during that interval, mu&s;t al&s;o be fixed; and after much conver&s;ation on that point, it was at length agreed, that Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> &s;hould advance him at the rate of fifty guineas a year, Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> con&s;enting that he &s;hould keep the room he then occupied in his hou&s;e.

What are your intentions or ex|pectations with regard to me? Can you &s;uppo&s;e that I am to &s;ub&s;i&s;t forever on advances from Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> without the &s;malle&s;t appearance of remittances or reim|bur&s;ements to him? His &s;ituation on that head is extremely embarra&s;&s;ing, nor is my own le&s;s &s;o: by a liberal allowance he may exceed <HI>your</HI> ideas of my nece&s;&s;ities, and too clo&s;e re&s;trictions are painful to us both, and indeed prejudicial to me. Such has been Mr. <HI>Jay's</HI> &s;ituation ever &s;ince my arrival in Europe, continually in hopes of being relieved by letters from you, and as often di&s;appointed. Delays are pardonable; but ab&s;olute neglect is unju&s;tifiable. Cannot you as lea&s;t inform Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> of the rea&s;ons which have hitherto prevented you from making him remittances, and your future expectations on that head! As to the &s;um he has already advanced <HI>he declares him&s;elf to be by no means pre&s;&s;ing for the re-payment of it:</HI> nor does he wi&s;h you to di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elf on that account, but to take your mea&s;ures relative to it, in any manner mo&s;t commodious to your&s;elf;&mdash;he will advance as my exigencies may require not exceeding fifty guineas per year, from the time of his departure, <HI>till next March,</HI> when as I have before ob&s;erved, if you do not furni&s;h me with adequate &s;upplies, and him with proper in&s;tructions, I mu&s;t abandon all the hopes I have formed in the political line, and return to Virginia Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on my &s;ituation, and the con&s;equences which may follow a further delay on &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an occa&s;ion. After near three years re&s;idence at this Court in the family of an American Mini&s;ter with <HI>the friend&s;hip and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of that Mini&s;ter</HI> to recommend me in America, my political projects cannot &s;urely be deemed chimerical. I am as yet too young to expect a public employ|ment,
<PB N="54" REF="019735_0056_0FACA558A4A87DB0">a &s;hort time will remove that objection, and in the interim I have the hap|pie&s;t opportunities of in&s;tructing my&s;elf in the politics of this country, and Eu|rope in general. The mutual intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of Spain and America will require that an eternal political intercour&s;e &s;hould exi&s;t between the two nations, and as a candi|date for an employment of that kind, I po&s;&s;e&s;s inconte&s;tible advantages. To elucidate this, a &s;hort review of my pa&s;t conduct here, may not be unnece&s;&s;ary. On my arrival at this place, I &s;o and my &s;ituation very different from the ideas I had previou&s;ly formed of it. The in deci&s;ion of the Court with re&s;pect to Ame|rica, &s;trongly influenced the conduct of individuals, which, <HI>joined to &s;ome more private rea&s;ons,</HI> (by no means however proceeding from Mr. <HI>Jay</HI> rendered all connection or even intercour&s;e with Spaniards, difficult, and <HI>to me</HI> really impo&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>My political pur&s;uits were in con&s;equence greatly impeded, if not ab&s;olutely fru&s;trated, as the fir&s;t &s;tep in that line was to render my&s;elf <HI>known</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h|ed,</HI> and by attracting <HI>attention</HI> acquire <HI>con&s;equence.</HI> Eight months experience too well convinced me of the impracticability of &s;ucce&s;s on my fir&s;t plan, and I be|gan to think &s;eriou&s;ly of abandoning it, when an occa&s;ion offered which I thought meritted attention. Immen&s;e preparations were making for an expedition to be commanded by the Duke de <HI>Crillon,</HI> and &s;aid to be again&s;t Gibraltar or Minor|ca, Policy &s;ugge&s;ted to me that &s;ome efforts on the occa&s;ion might be of utility in the attainment of my grand object, as it would inevitably remove the difficul|ties I had experienced in forming connections here. Recon&s;ideration but con|firmed me in the idea, and in con&s;equence I demanded the King's permi&s;&s;ion to attend the Duke de <HI>Crillon</HI> as a Volunteer. This &s;tep occa&s;ioned great &s;pecula|lation, and effectually an&s;wered my purpo&s;e in <HI>attracting attention.</HI> To the &s;urprize of every body my reque&s;t was granted, and I &s;erved the campaign in the Mediterranean as Volunteer Aid de Camp to the Commander in Chief. Du|ring the &s;iege of Mahon I a&s;&s;idiou&s;ly endeavoured, both from real e&s;teem and poli|cy, to recommend my&s;elf to the Spaniards, in which I &s;o happily &s;ucceeded, that at my return I found every political ob&s;tacle removed, and nothing now remains but to pro&s;ecute my plan under every advantage that my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Such is my &s;ituation and &s;uch my views in Europe, which will be all rendered abortive by a further delay on your part.

My reception at Court was flattering enough, though my intention of quitting the &s;ervice occa&s;ioned univer&s;al &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;ome of my mo&s;t inti|mate friends, who from their &s;ituations could be&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know the di&s;-di&s;po&s;ition of both the Court and people, after informing me of the conjectures up|on the occa&s;ion, candidly advi&s;ed me either to leave Spain, or fini&s;h in the military line what I had happily commenced.

<P>Afterwards, to wit, in Augu&s;t 1783, the Hon. Mr. Adams wrote a letter to Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Jay, propo&s;ing Mr. <HI>Thaxter,</HI> who was his private Secretary, as a proper per&s;on to carry the Dennitive Treaty of Peace to Congre&s;s, and mentioning the rea&s;ons why he thought that mark of attention was due to him, Mr. Adams told Mr. Jay, that Dr. Franklin, on reading it, &s;aid, <HI>"be had no objections,"</HI> and Mr. Jay on being informed of this, and perfectly concurring in opinion with Mr. Adams relative to Mr. Thaxter, al&s;o con&s;ented.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of September, 1783, Mr. Littlepage waited on Mr. Jay, and told him, that the matter of his carrying the Treaty to America now re&s;ted &s;olely with him, for that on applying to Dr. Franklin for his note, the Doctor an&s;wered, <HI>"he had no predilection for Mr. Adams's Secretary, and if it would do him (Mr. Littlepage) a plea&s;ure, he &s;hould have his vote."</HI> Mr. Jay ob&s;erved that there mu&s;t be &s;ome mi&s;take in the bu&s;ine&s;s, for that Mr. Franklin had told Mr. Adams, <HI>"he had no objections to Mr. Thaxter's being the per&s;on,"</HI> and further added, that for his own part, he really thought, as Mr. Thaxter had long been in the diplomatic department, he certainly ought on &s;uch an occa&s;ion to be preferred to <HI>one who had never been in it.</HI> Mr. Littlepage in&s;i&s;ted on his having the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">octor's promi&s;e, and went away to appearance much di&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>On the 2d September, Mr. Jay received as in&s;olent a letter from. Mr. Littlepage, as could well be penned;&mdash;it reproached him in very indecent language, for having told him that Mr. Franklin was for Mr. Thaxter, when on the contrary, he had promi&s;ed to vote for <HI>him,</HI> it charged him with this as a palpable fal&s;ehood; it reproached him in general terms for ill u&s;age; it a&s;&s;erted that Mr. Jay hadgiven him rea&s;on to expect his vote; it contained a challenge, and among other abu&s;ive pa&s;|&s;ages, in&s;inuated that Mr. Jay had declined bringing him to Paris, merely to leave him as a &s;py on Mr. Carmichael, at Madrid.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, and not long after the receipt of this letter, Mr. Adams came in, and &s;hortly
<PB N="62" REF="019735_0064_0FACA55EA375BE58">afterwards a &s;ervant informed Mr. Jay, that Mr. Littlepage wanted to &s;ee him; he was admitted, and de&s;ired Mr. Jay to &s;peak with him in private, to which Mr. Jay replied, that he could have no|thing to &s;ay, which Mr. Jay had any objections to his &s;aying before Mr. Adams. Mr. Jay &s;hewed Mr. Adams the letter, and that gentleman gave his opinion of it in very explicit and proper terms to Mr. Littlepage, adding that <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> had told Mr. Jay, that Dr. Frank in had no objections to Mr. Thaxter's being appointed, and that the Doctor had told him &s;o. A conver&s;ation then en|&s;ued between Mr. Jay and Mr. Littlepage, relative to the other very exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages in his letter: Mr. Jay po&s;itively denied the truth of the hardy a&s;&s;ertions contained in it, and with re&s;pect to the rea&s;ons of his having remained at Madrid, referred him to his own letter to his uncle, of the 15th of May, 1782, and a&s;ked him how he could reconcile what he <HI>now</HI> in&s;inuated, with the con|tents of that letter;&mdash;he confe&s;&s;ed that they <HI>did not "run parallel:"</HI> after a little further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he began to appear &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of his conduct, in &s;hort, <HI>he a&s;ked Mr. Jay's pardon for what he had written, he de&s;ired it might be all forgotten, and for that purpo&s;e, reque&s;ted Mr. Jay's permi&s;&s;ion to burn the letter, which</HI> (Mr. Jay con&s;enting to) <HI>he then immediately burnt:</HI> He then gave Mr. Jay his hand, and took his leave: Mr. dams was in the room from the time Mr. Littlepage came into, and &s;ome time after, the time Mr. Littlepage want away; and to the well known can|dour and integrity of that Honorable Gentleman Mr. Jay appeals, for the truth and proof of the&s;e facts.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after this, Mr. Jay was well informed, that Mr. Littlepage had &s;poken of this tran&s;action, and had &s;aid <HI>that the di&s;pute was accommodated, on Mr. Jay's making certain admi&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>From that time forwards, Mr. Jay avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible, all manner of intercour&s;e and corre&s;pondence with that young man: Nor does he recollect to have written to, or received a &s;ingle line further from him, during the cour&s;e of that year, except the following note when in London, and to which he did not return any an&s;wer, viz.&mdash;</P>

Mr. Jay neither mentioned nor &s;hewed to him Mr. Littlepage's letter of 15th June, 1782, nor any of its contents. In the cour&s;e of the conferrence, Mr. Carmichael mentioned him, and intimated that he had good rea&s;on to believe that Mr. Littlepage had played a double game between them; for that after Mr. Jay had left Madrid, he had taken him into his hou&s;e, and lent him money; and that he had told him many things <HI>to Mr. Jay's di&s;advantage,</HI> which appeared to him <HI>very extraordinary and improbable;</HI> and among others, <HI>"that Mr. Jay had left b m at Madrid ex|pre&s;ly to be a &s;py upon him, (Mr. Carmichael; and had given him a cypher to enable him to convey his advices more &s;afely and &s;ecurely."</HI> Mr. Jay a&s;&s;ured Mr. Carmi|chael, that it was a mo&s;t impudent fal&s;hood, and <HI>he</HI> did not he&s;&s;itate to &s;ay, that he really believed it to be &s;o.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSE Mr. Jay to be as capable of inventing, as Mr. Littlepage confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have been of certifying, fal&s;e facts; is it probable that Mr. Jay would have (e&s;pecially con&s;idering his profe&s;&s;ional knowledge of &s;uch &s;ubjects) contrived that letter of 15th June, 1781, &s;o very injudiciou&s;ly, as that it &s;hould repre&s;ent his witne&s;s to be a per&s;on highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the man whom his te&s;timony was de&s;igned to depreciate? Would he, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, have invented, and brought into &s;trong light, re&s;entments of his witne&s;s again&s;t the adver&s;e party? or would he not rather have given his witne&s;s the appearance of an indifferent per&s;on, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately giving evidence merely from regard to ju&s;tice and to truth?</P>
<P>If <HI>that letter</HI> was of Mr. Jay's invention, and written at his in&s;tigation, how did it happen that Mr. Littlepage, &s;o often in the cour&s;e of his &s;ub&s;equent letters, written during his ab&s;ence, &s;hould not only refer to it as true, but al&s;o mention additional facts and circum&s;tances again&s;t Mr. Carmichael, which exactly corre&s;|pond with the motives and conduct imputed by him to that gentleman in this?</P>
<P>How did it happen that Mr. Littlepage did never, in any of tho&s;e moments of chagrin and vexation in which he wrote his &s;everal rude and abu&s;ive letters to Mr. Jay, even &s;o much as intimate, that Mr. Jay had made him write and atte&s;t fal&s;e|hoods?</P>
<P>Is it to be pre&s;umed that common &s;en&s;e, if not common hone&s;ty, would not have re&s;trained Mr. Jay from thus ra&s;hly putting him&s;elf in the power of a per&s;on &s;o incon&s;iderate, &s;o volatile, and &s;o young?</P>
<P>Had Mr. Jay &s;o committed him&s;elf, how is it to be accounted for, that he &s;hould, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, for now near five years, have per&s;evered in one &s;tedfa&s;t,
<PB N="76" REF="019735_0078_0FACA56922B4FAB0">inflexible line of conduct; and by repeatedly cro&s;&s;ing and di&s;appointing Mr. Littlepage's favorite with is and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;o net<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s leaving him to &s;uffer for his rudene&s;s and indelicacy, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;timulate him to indulge his propen&s;ity to pour forth reproaches?</P>
<P>How did it happen, that, if Mr. Littlepage po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Mr. Jay's confidence in the degree he pretends, that none of Mr. Jay's letters to him contain the lea&s;t mark of it? They &s;ay nothing of Mr. Carmichael, but what &s;prung from the letter in que&s;tion: nor any thing of Mr. Living&s;ton, but that he was gone to America&mdash; not even a hint of his rea&s;ons for going, nor of the circum&s;tances inducing or at|tending it.</P>
<P>If Mr. Jay had wi&s;hed to leave Mr. Littlepage at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to watch Mr. Car|michael, why did he <HI>advi&s;e and pre&s;s him</HI> to go to <HI>America,</HI> as Mr. Littlepage him&s;elf admits? How did it happen that none of their &s;ub&s;equent letter; even alluded to &s;uch a de&s;ign, or contained even an ob&s;cure hint relative to the executi|on of it.</P>
<P>If &s;uch an explanation as littlepage pretends, really did take place between him and Mr. Carmichael, whereby he was led toentertain the opinion which he &s;ays he <HI>thenceforth</HI> entertained of Mr. Jay; how are we to account for his &s;ub&s;equent let|ters of 10 June, 29 Oct. 5 and 29 Dec. 1782, in which he expre&s;&s;es ideas the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite that can be to &s;uch an opinion? Why did he afterwards &s;olicit Mr. Jay's favor and influence at Paris, by his letter of 16th July 1783, and when Mr. Jay then acted directly contrary to his wi&s;hes and reque&s;t, why did he a&s;k Mr. Jay's pardon in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Adams, for the expre&s;&s;ions he u&s;ed on that occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>How did it happen that here in America Mr. Jay &s;hould continue to keep him at a di&s;tance, and hold &s;uch a conduct towards him, as in&s;tead of betraying appre|hen&s;ion and prudential pliancy, rather invited offence and crimination?</P>
<P>Does all this look as if Mr. Jay was con&s;cious of having put him&s;elf in the power of this young man? Or that Mr. Littlepage could with truth &s;ay any thing injurious to the character which Mr. Jay, from his youth, and for years, &s;pent under the public eye, and in the public &s;ervice, has invariably maintained?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, after a full inve&s;tigation of Mr. Littlepage's behaviour and practices, as delineated in his letters and publications, can any other conclu&s;ion be drawn, than that <HI>Hic niger e&s;t, hune tu Romane caveto.</HI></P>
