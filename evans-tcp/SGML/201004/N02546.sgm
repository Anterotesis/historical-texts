<P><LABEL>IV. Charge.</LABEL>
The Bill then Charges, That on the bearers de&s;ire of the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI>'s
<PB N="3" REF="003019_0005_0FEFA0A29AA2C578">
Account of Charges and Commi&s;&s;ions, he told them, <HI>It came to about Fourteen Hundred Pounds,</HI> but refu&s;ed to &s;how them any Account for what, and told them, <HI>if it was not paid in three days, he would prote&s;t again&s;t them, and not deliver the Tobaccoes.</HI> Which behaviour in demanding of &s;o great a Sum in &s;o &s;hort a time, and denying to &s;how for what, &s;o contrary to the Cu&s;tom of fair Merchants, &s;urprized the &s;aid bearers, and brought them into a great &s;trait. That on the 25th day of <HI>November</HI> afore&s;aid, the day in&s;i&s;ted on for payment of the &s;aid Sum, the bearers, in the pre&s;ence of the Notary, Counted out the &s;aid Fourteen Hundred Pounds, to the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> who then did, and not till then would, &s;how his Account; the Ballance whereof amounted to 1397 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d</HI> which Sum he then received and gave his Receipt for it.</P>
<P><LABEL>V. Charge.</LABEL>
The Bill further charges, that the Account is extravagant, fal&s;e &amp; fraudulent, in the greate&s;t part of the Articles thereof. And that tho' three times as much as the Commi&s;&s;ions due, were therein Charged, yet no &s;ooner he Received the &s;aid Sum, but he trumped up a new pretence, and &s;howed a Bond of 1500 <HI>l.</HI> with condition to pay Five Pounds for every Hundred Pounds worth of Snuff he &s;hould deliver, to be computed at the rate of Eleven Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound, tell|ing them, they mu&s;t execute that or they &s;hould have no Snuff, but if they would, they might begin to weigh to morrow, whereupon the bearers executed al&s;o that Bond.</P>
<P><LABEL>VI. Charge.</LABEL>
That afterwards, the &s;aid <HI>Hett</HI> delivered to the bearers 1691 Bags of Snuff, great and &s;mall, damaged and undamaged, weighing 315400 <HI>l.</HI> and a half, 101 Rolls of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> weighing 10412 <HI>l.</HI> and no more, as by the deputy Weigh-Ma&s;ters Certificate appears, and then &s;aid, he had no more to deliver, when by his Account to the <HI>India Company,</HI> there remained undelivered 307 bags of Snuff, weighing 64424&frac12; <HI>Pounds,</HI> 3875 <HI>Pounds</HI> of <HI>Tobacco</HI> in Roll, and 9628 <HI>Pounds</HI> in Leaf <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and upwards, which he &s;till denyed to deliver, and therefore on the 9th of <HI>March</HI> there-after, the bearers, in the pre&s;ence of the Notary, de|manded it of him, and upon his denyal, prote&s;ted, according to the Cu&s;tom of Merchants, in the like ca&s;e.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="003019_0009_0FEFA0AE41D373F8">Therefore, and for that the Complainants could have no Remedy herein at Law, being matters of Fraud and Di&s;covery, they prayed the aid of this Court to Compel the Defendants to a Di&s;covery of the Pre|mi&s;&s;es, by An&s;wer upon Oath, and to produce the Books of Accounts that were kept of the &s;aid Tobaccoes, and to come to a fair Account, &amp; deliver up the &s;aid Bond and the Snuff remaining in their hands, and that the Com|plainants might have &s;uch other and farther Relief as is agreeable to Equity and good Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And farther prayed, a Warrant of Injunction to &s;tay Proceedings at Law on the &s;aid Bond, and a &s;ubpoena to appear and an&s;wer the Premi&s;&s;es. Which being granted, and the Defendants &s;erved there-with, they appeared, and on the 25th of <HI>October,</HI> 1726. they were ordered to An&s;wer the Premi&s;&s;es in eight Days, according to the cour&s;e of the Court; which time being expired, at the prayer of the Defendants, further time was granted them, by the favour of the Court, until the 12th Day of <HI>December,</HI> there-after. At which time the Defendants filed an An&s;wer, Plea &amp; Demurrer to the &s;aid Bill, which Plea and Demurrer came to Hearing on the third Day of <HI>February,</HI> there-after, when after hearing of the Arguments of the Council of both &s;ides, this Court did conceive the &s;aid Plea &amp; Demurrer were not &s;ufficient to barr the Complain|ants of Relief in the Premi&s;&s;es, and therefore over-ruled the &s;ame, &s;aving to the Defendants neverthele&s;s, any benefit they could make of their Plea at the hearing of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>And the Complainants Excepted to the An&s;wer, as In&s;ufficient, and Evading the Di&s;covery of the matters prayed in the Bill to be Di&s;covered, and delivered their Exceptions to the Defendants Clerk, &s;etting forth the Points in which the &s;ame An&s;wer was In&s;ufficient and Eva&s;ive, in order for the Defendants to An&s;wer to the points defective in Eight Days, according to the cour&s;e of the Court; which time being elap&s;ed, and no An&s;wer to the&s;e Points put in, the Complainants <HI>Jacob De Lara</HI> and <HI>Manuel vaz de Co&s;ta,</HI> on the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> made Oath to this purpo&s;e, <HI>That they came from</HI> England <HI>hither to receive the &s;aid Tobaccoes, and that ever &s;ince</HI> October, 1725. <HI>they have been here without any other bu&s;ine&s;s, and have no other bu&s;ine&s;s here what&s;oever, than the obtaining the &s;aid Tobaccoes, and Ju&s;tice in this Cau&s;e.</HI> And the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> made Oath, <HI>That he had pre&s;&s;ing Affairs in</HI> Europe, <HI>which required his Pre&s;ence there, and that he had put his Affairs in order here for Departure, Except only the obtaining the &s;aid Tobaccos and Ju&s;tice in this Cau&s;e.</HI> And the &s;aid <HI>De Lara, De Co&s;ta</HI> and <HI>Pacheco</HI> having, by their Petition (with Affidavits to the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid, thereunto annexed) &s;et forth to this Court, &s;undry Cau&s;es that induced them to believe the Defendants affected delay in this Cau&s;e; That Delay of Ju&s;tice in this cau&s;e, in their Cir|cum&s;tances, might prove as prejudicial to them, as the Denyal thereof: That great Delays were commonly u&s;ed upon the References of Exceptions to Ma&s;ters, and therefore prayed that their Exceptions might be either heard by the Court without reference thereof, as &s;ometimes has been done to prevent Delays; Or that the Ma&s;ter, to whom they &s;hould be referred, might have &s;pecial Directions for Di&s;patch. Which Petition and Affidavits were pre&s;ent|ed to this Court on the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> the Defendants having been fir&s;t &s;erved with Copies thereof, and a Hearing on the Merits thereof, was appoint|ed on the 16th Day of the &s;ame Month: At which Day the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rits of the &s;aid Petition and Affidavits being fully argued and debated by Council of both &s;ides, this Court was of Opinion, that the Complainants Circum&s;tances in|tituled
<PB N="8" REF="003019_0010_0FEFA0B1A50850F0">
them to the Expediting of Ju&s;tice in this Cau&s;e, and that if need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, their Exceptions &s;hould be heard in Court without reference. But the De|fendants Council admitting their fir&s;t An&s;wer not &s;ufficient, and denying any Intentions of Delay, and Promi&s;ing to make a full and perfect An&s;wer, if a Fortnights Time was allowed them for the doing thereof (the &s;ame being twice the time allowed for that purpo&s;e by the Cour&s;e of the Court) which time being elap&s;ed, at the Prayers of the Defendants, and further Promi&s;es of their Council, to make a full and perfect An&s;wer, further times were allowed till the 20th Day of <HI>March,</HI> there-after, when the Defendants filed their &s;econd An&s;wer; to which the Complainants again excepted, as entirely Eva&s;ive and In&s;ufficient. Which Exceptions, being delivered, and no An&s;wer put in to the Points Excepted to, they, by Order, came to be heard in Court on the 5th Day of <HI>May,</HI> 1727. At which Day, upon arguing and Debating the &s;ame, by the Council of both &s;ides, this Court was of Opinion, That the &s;aid An&s;wer was very Eva&s;ive and In&s;ufficient in many Points, and therefore ordered a further An&s;wer to the&s;e Points. Which not being done in the Eight days (the time allowed for it by the cour&s;e of the Court) and further favour of Time being conceived not due (the Circum&s;tances of the Complainants and long Times before granted on the fir&s;t and &s;econd An&s;wers, being con&s;idered) the Defendants were in Contempt of the Court; And there|fore on the 19th of the &s;ame Month of <HI>May,</HI> Attachments i&s;&s;ued to take the Defendants for their Contempt: who on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>June,</HI> 1727. filed their third An&s;wer. Afterwards, on the &s;ame fir&s;t Day of <HI>June,</HI> the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> by Affidavit, &s;et forth, That he had di&s;covered &s;ome failing in his ad An&s;wer. That the <HI>Forty Bales of Snuff,</HI> the &s;ale of which Capt. <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> acknowledged to be ju&s;t, and &s;aid in the &s;aid An&s;wer, to be part of that for which Credit is given in the Defendants Account, was a mi&s;take, and that he believed it was that Sale of forty Bags &s;old to pay Coll. <HI>Lurting</HI> his Store-Rent, before the Snuff was delivered to him and <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> &amp; by Pitition, prayed leave to amend his &s;econd An&s;wer, by razing the&s;e words out of it (which is part of that for which Credit was given in this Defendants Account.) Wherupon it was Ordered, That the Prayer of the Petition be granted, unle&s;s cau&s;e &s;ufficient was &s;hown on the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> to the contrary. At which day the &s;aid Petition and Affidavit came to be argued, in pre&s;ence of the Council of both &s;ides, when the Council for the Complainants produced a Certificate under the hand of the &s;aid Coll. <HI>Lurting,</HI> who is one of the Ma&s;ters of this Court, that only Twenty Four Bags had been &s;old to pay his Store-Rent, and from thence concluded, that could not be the Sale of 40 Bags which <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> approved of. That <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el's</HI> Letter, by them produced, bearing date eight Months before the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Tobaccoes were acquitted by the Admiralty, acknowledging a Sale of 40 Bales of Snuff to be ju&s;t, was a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that &s;uch a Sale was made by them, to whom the approbation was given, and al&s;o a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that they had Snuff of his to &s;ell, and that it was not a Sale of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Snuff, becau&s;e it was then in the Cu&s;tody of the Court of Admiralty, and &s;o not in their Power to &s;ell any of it: Which com|pared with the proceedings of the Admiralty, by which it appears, that <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> claimed as his own Property, a great Quantity of the 2217 Bags of Snuff Libelled again&s;t; That what he claimed, was acquitted about two years before the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s was, and before his departure from hence; and that there were only 1998 Bags of Snuff Delivered to <HI>Hett</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> as the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s; and from thence concluded, That <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> had Snuff of his own to
<PB N="9" REF="003019_0011_0FEFA0B45902B9A8">
leave in their hands, out of which that Sale might have been made. And fur|ther in&s;i&s;ted, That it appearing, that at <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI>'s Departure, they undertook to pay &s;undry Debts for him, and to be at the Charge of the Defence of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Snuff, it was improbable they would undertake this without his leaving &s;omething in their hands to do it with, e&s;pecially &s;eeing he had enough to leave with them, even of Snuff; and con&s;idering how precarious a Fond the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Snuff was, to repay them at that time, it being then as likely to be Condemned as Acquitted; and had it been Con|demned, the Difficulty of their recovery of <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el,</HI> a Sea-fairing man of an|other Nation; and if acquitted, there could be no rea&s;on that the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Snuff &s;hould pay <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI>'s Debts. Which compared al&s;o with the great Sum allowed the <HI>India Company</HI> above their Freight, even when the Snuff was not Delivered at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as it ought to have been: And from thence in|ferred, That there was a great Probability that <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> left Effects in their hands to pay the&s;e Debts and Charges of the Pro&s;ecution, and that this Sale of Forty Bales, &s;o approved of by <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el,</HI> was a part of what he &s;o left in their hands, and of con&s;equence, Credit ought to have been given for it in the Defendants Accounts, and for all that he &s;o left in their hands, and the rather for that the Defendants &s;till refu&s;ed to produce their Books of Accounts, tho' expre&s;ly demanded by the Bill, and twice &s;ince by the pa&s;t Exceptions to the An&s;wers. Upon the whole, That this was a Di&s;covery accidentally dropt from the Defendants, which has with the utmo&s;t Care been endeavoured to be Concealed, and that no part of it ought to be with-drawn, and the rather, in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e it is not &s;hown by the Affidavit, that he was &s;urprized into it, and any Rea&s;on there appearing, would &s;erve as well to &s;tifle any Perjury, when perceived as this: And as it was an Evidence affecting the Credit of what the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> &s;hould &s;et forth in his An&s;wers, they had a Right to the Pre&s;ervation thereof, and the granting the Defendants Petition would be a Depriving them of it; and the rather, it ought to &s;tand, becau&s;e the Defendants third An&s;wer was &s;till in&s;ufficient, and to which the Complainants had Ex|cepted; and &s;o the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> would have an opportunity by a fourth An&s;wer, to add what &s;alvo he thought proper to this matter. Upon Con|&s;ideration whereof, and hearing all that could be &s;aid by the Council of both &s;ides, the Prayer of the &s;aid Petition was then di&s;allowed; Neverthele&s;s, if the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> had not the opportunity of a fourth An&s;wer, and if he would then apply further, the Court would farther con&s;ider of the matter. And the Complainants having Excepted to the Defendants third An&s;wer, &s;till as In&s;ufficient and Eva&s;ive, in many Points, the 14th Day of <HI>June</HI> was appointed, by order of this Court, for hearing the &s;aid Exceptions. At which Day the &s;ame came to be debated &amp; agrued, in the pre&s;ence of Council of both &s;ides; and the 16th of the &s;ame Month was then appointed for a further hearing of the &s;ame, when the Exceptions were further Debated and argued by the Council of both &s;ides&punc; on each of which Days the &s;aid third An&s;wer was found In&s;ufficient and Eva&s;ive in &s;undry Points; and on the &s;aid 16th Day, a further An&s;wer was ordered to the&s;e Points; To which Points the Defendants filed their fourth An&s;wer on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th Day of <HI>June.</HI> To all which four An&s;wers the Complainants, on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>July,</HI> 1727. re|plyed, offering to prove the Charges of their Bill, and denying the Defendants Defences in their An&s;wers, to be true. And the Defendants being &s;ubpoened to Rejoyn, they filed their Rejoynder on the 12th Day of the &s;ame Month, denying the Replication, and offering to prove their defences in their An&s;wers.
<PB N="10" REF="003019_0012_0FEFA0B7331D0D70">
And on the 13th of the &s;ame Month, the Defendants were &s;erved with a Rule to produce their Witne&s;&s;es, in order to Examination of them. After|wards, on the 15th day of the &s;ame Month, the Defendants, by Petition pray'd for a Writ of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Exeat Provinciam</HI> again&s;t the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> to com|pel him to give &s;ecurity for the Co&s;ts of this Suit, and for the Payment of the &s;aid 1500 <HI>l.</HI> Bond, in ca&s;e the Complainants were ca&s;t; which accordingly was granted, and the Complainant <HI>Pacheco</HI> taken and arre&s;ted thereon, and to which he gave in &s;ecurity in Two Thou&s;and Pounds accordingly. After|wards, to wit, the 18th Day of the &s;ame Month of <HI>July,</HI> the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> by Affidavit &s;et forth, That the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> had for &s;everal Weeks pa&s;t ab&s;conded; that he had great rea&s;on to believe, that <HI>Abraham Gouverneur</HI> was the chief in&s;trument, and a party in carrying on the Frauds com|plained of in the Bill. That he was informed, and believed, that the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> had made over the greate&s;t part of his E&s;tate to his Son-in-Law <HI>William Smith,</HI> and his Daughter <HI>Sarah Hett,</HI> on purpo&s;e to Defeat the Complainants of their Relief in this Suit: That he verily believed, on a fair Account, in this Suit, the Defendants would be found indebted to the Complainants, above three Thou&s;and Pounds; &amp; that he feared that if the &s;aid <HI>Abraham Gouverneur, Wm. Smith</HI> &amp; <HI>Sarah Hett</HI> were made Parties to the Bill, they would not abide the Judgment of the Court, and had a like fear of <HI>Mrs. Fre&s;neau.</HI> Wherefore by Petition, &s;etting al&s;o forth, That it appeared by the An&s;wers, that the &s;aid <HI>Abraham Gouverneur</HI> had received &s;undry large Sums of Money, part of what the &s;aid <HI>Hett</HI> had defrauded the Complainants of, and for which the &s;aid <HI>Gouverneur</HI> could render an Account. Which Petition being annexed to the &s;aid Affidavit the Complainants thereby prayed <HI>Ne Exeats</HI> again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Abraham Gouverneur, Wm. Smith, Sarah Hett</HI> and <HI>He&s;ter Fre&s;neau,</HI> and that the Complainants might have leave to make the &s;aid <HI>Abraham Gouverneur, Wm. Smith</HI> &amp; <HI>Sarah Hett</HI> Parties to the &s;aid Bill; and (becau&s;e they were aver&s;e to that Charge, unle&s;s of an unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of doing it, or of lo&s;ing their Money) they prayed time for the doing thereof, until the then Defendants have been ten days in Contempt for not complying with &s;uch Decree as &s;hall be given in this Cau&s;e, if any &s;uch &s;hall be given again&s;t the Defendants. Whereupon the Prayer of the Petition was granted, re&s;tricting the Security on the <HI>Ne Exeats</HI> to <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds.</HI> And the &s;aid <HI>Abrah. Gouverneur, William Smith, Sarah Hett</HI> and <HI>He&s;ter Fre&s;neau</HI> were taken on the <HI>Ne Exeats,</HI> and gave in Security accordingly. On which &s;ame 18th of <HI>July,</HI> the Com|plainants, by another Petition, prayed (for avoiding of delay) that both &s;ides might make their full proof before the hearing of the Cau&s;e, and be concluded from Examining after the hearing: And on hearing of the Council of both &s;ides on the merits of the &s;aid Petition, this Court did not &s;ee &s;ufficient cau&s;e for the granting thereof, therefore di&s;allowed the Prayer of the &s;ame. Afterwards, on the 21th day of the &s;ame Month, the Defendants were &s;erved with the Rule to Examine their Witne&s;&s;es, &amp; the Complainants proceeded to Examine their Witne&s;&s;es. Afterwards, to wit, the &s;econd day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1727. the De|fendants, by Petition, without Affidvit, prayed Commi&s;&s;ions to <HI>London,</HI> to Examine <HI>George Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ot,</HI> and the Complainants <HI>De Lara</HI> &amp; <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> who were gone there&punc; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>France</HI> to Examine Capt. <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> and Mon&s;. <HI>Dur|and,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> heretofore Lieutenants of the Victory, &amp; Mon&s;. <HI>Baraule</HI> Clerk of the &s;aid Ship&punc; On which Petition, Council of both &s;ides being heard, tho&s;e for the Complainants in&s;i&s;ted,</P>

<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> That to make that Nece&s;&s;ity evident, it ought to appear, by Affidavit or other-wi&s;e, what Points each Witne&s;s can depo&s;e to, and that the Petitioner knows of none here to prove the &s;ame Points, whereon the Court might and ought to con&s;ider, whether the&s;e Points were material, that Delays, by unnece&s;&s;ary Examinations, might be avided; and that, with this agrees the Practice of the Court of Chancery at Home, as appears in the Book of Orders thereof, page 207.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>dly,</HI> That &s;hould the Court thereon be convinced that the Points were material, and that the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es could depo&s;e to them, yet the other Party had the Liberty of admitting the&s;e Points, as proved, which the Complainants would certainly chu&s;e, in this ca&s;e, rather than be delayed; and played, That for the irregularity of this Petition, being without any Affidavit or Proof of the facts therof, it might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Whereupon, and upon hearing what could be &s;aid by the Council of both &s;ides, this Court did order, That on or before the 2<HI>d</HI> day of <HI>September,</HI> the Defendants do file the Points to which they want to Examine beyond Sea; and by the 8th of the &s;ame Month, that they make it evident by Affidavit, or other-wi&s;e, that the Witne&s;&s;es can materially depo&s;e to the&s;e Points. Afterwards, to wit, the Ninth day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1727. the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> by Affidavit, &s;et forth, That he had information that the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> and one <HI>John Lafont,</HI> had privately packt a large Quantity of the Snuff in di&s;pute, into Barrels, and concealed the &s;ame; that it was lately carried in the night to, and concealed in the Cellar of one Mrs. <HI>Bieu,</HI> the Wife of a Marriner; and by Petition there-with, &s;et forth, That the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> having ab&s;conded, and the burthen of this Suit being like to fall on the Widow &amp; Children of <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> the Di&s;covery hereof would &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them; and that the Widow had prayed, That all means might be taken for the di&s;covery &amp; Recovery thereof, therefore pray'd the Court to do therein what might be agreable to Equity and Ju&s;tice. Whereupon this Court did Order the Examiner of this Court to go to the Hou&s;es of the &s;aid <HI>Bieu</HI> and <HI>Lafont,</HI> and to Examine them to the Truth of the &s;aid Information; and if upon Examination it appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; Then that <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters of the Court, do take the Snuff into his Cu&s;tody, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the further Order of this Court. Pur&s;uant to which Order, the &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> day report|ed to this Court, that he Examined Mrs. <HI>Bieu</HI> to the truth of the Information afore&s;aid, &s;et forth in the &s;aid Petition, on Oath; to which &s;he an&s;wered in the <HI>Negative,</HI> and declar'd that &s;he knew nothing of the matters therein contain'd. That he in like manner Examined Mr. <HI>Lafont</HI> to the &s;ame, upon Oath, to
<PB N="12" REF="003019_0014_0FEFA0BB5B184F50">
which the &s;aid <HI>Lafont</HI> al&s;o an&s;wered in the <HI>Negative,</HI> and declared, he knew nothing of the matters there in contained: But being informed that Mr. <HI>Lafont</HI> had con&s;idered better of what he had &s;aid, and that he would declare the whole truth, if he were Re-Examined, he the &s;aid Examiner returned to Mr. <HI>Lafonts,</HI> and in the pre&s;ence of Coll. <HI>Lurting,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters of this Court, Examined him to the &s;ame Points he had before done, to which he then replyed, That there was a private Cellar in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bieu</HI> before-mentioned, that there were many Barrels of Snuff lodged in &s;aid Cellar; That he had packed three or four Barrels of &s;aid Snuff; that the &s;ame was there lodged by Mr. <HI>Rene Hett,</HI> or his order, and marked for Beef; and that &s;aid Cellar was hired by &s;aid <HI>Hett</HI> for that purpo&s;e. The &s;aid Examiner further reported, That after he had gone from Mr. <HI>Lafonts</HI> Hou&s;e, but &s;ome few Steps, Mr. <HI>Lafont</HI> followed him, and de&s;ired him to Ob&s;erve, that he did not know that the &s;aid Snuff belonged to the Cargo of the Ship <HI>Victory.</HI> And the &s;aid Ma&s;ter Reported, That hav|ing been pre&s;ent at the &s;aid La&s;t Examination of <HI>Lafont,</HI> he went with <HI>Elias Pipon,</HI> Son-in-Law of &s;aid <HI>Lafont,</HI> with the Con&s;ent of &s;aid <HI>Lafont,</HI> to the Cellar of the &s;aid <HI>Bieu,</HI> within which Cellar, along the Wall on the left &s;ide, there were Stanchions put up, and boards behind tho&s;e Stanchions, which Mr. <HI>Pipon</HI> having beat down, behind them then appeared a &s;mall door nailed fa&s;t, which he opened, within which was a &s;mall Cellar, where lay Twenty Casks of Snuff, which he the &s;aid Ma&s;ter took into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to wait the fur|ther order of this Court concerning the &s;ame: Which Twenty Casks weigh 3697 Pounds neat. <HI>Robert Lurting, M. C.</HI> Afterwards, to wit, the 24th Day of the &s;ame Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Complainants by Petition, &s;et forth, That they had credible information of &s;undry more Quantities of the &s;aid Snuff, which was quickly to be Tran&s;ported to the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> who &s;till ab&s;conded in another Province, to avoid the Ju&s;tice of this Court, and that they had given notice of Examining &s;undry Per&s;ons, who they had rea&s;on to believe, were privy to the &s;aid Concealments, and de&s;ign of Tran&s;portation of &s;aid Snuff, and therefore pray'd Relief of this Court herein; Whereupon it was ordered, That if the Examiner upon the Examination of the Witne&s;&s;es in this cau&s;e, does there-from di&s;cover any more Quantities of Snuff, &s;o concealed by the Defendant, <HI>Hett,</HI> That the Examiner acquaint this Court thereof, And if his Excellency &s;hould be ab&s;ent, that <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters, do take it into his Cu&s;tody, to wait the further Order of this Court.</P>
<P>Afterwards, pur&s;uant to the Order of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2d, the Defendants filed the Points they would Examine to beyond Sea, which in &s;ub&s;tance are,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That Capt. <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> agreed to pay <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> and <HI>Hett</HI> all the Com|mi&s;&s;ions they charge.</P>

<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> That he ordered them to pay for Mr. <HI>Baraules</HI> Maintenance at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly,</HI> That he ordered them to act with the Advice of <HI>Abraham Gouver|neur</HI> in the whole Affair, and to pay him for his Trouble.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly,</HI> That he ordered them not to part with the Snuff to the <HI>French Com|pany,</HI> without a preci&s;e Order from him.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="13" REF="003019_0015_0FEFA0BDF00FAA48">8<HI>thly,</HI> To Examine <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;ell</HI> whether his Letter of the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1721. was not upon Notice of the Seizure of forty Bags of Snuff for Store-Rent.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>thly,</HI> To Examine Mr. <HI>Chabot</HI> in <HI>London</HI> concerning the Quantity of Snuff &s;ent in the <HI>Duke of Portland.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10<HI>thly,</HI> To Examine <HI>De Lara</HI> and <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> as to an Agreement about the Account and Bond &s;et forth in the An&s;wers.</P>
<P>And the Hearing of this Matter being put off to the 15th day of <HI>September,</HI> 1727. at which day the &s;ame coming to be heard, in pre&s;ence of Council of both &s;ides, the Council for the Executors of <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> di&s;owned the &s;aid Petition for Commi&s;&s;ions, and prayed that this Court would proceed without delay to the Determination of this Cau&s;e. And by the Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> it was in&s;i&s;ted on, That the&s;e Points were material, and proper to be examined to in Foreign Parts, in &s;o far as mo&s;t of the&s;e Points were by the An&s;wers a&s;&s;erted to be True; and that the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ons, who from the nature of the thing, mu&s;t have been Tran&s;acting them, or privy thereto, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be the mo&s;t proper Evidences thereto.</P>
<P>To which it was an&s;wered by the Complainants Council, That they con|ceived them not very material, and rather than to be put to the Delay of Com|mi&s;&s;ions, would admit every one of the&s;e Points to be true. And then in part, but more fully afterwards; on the hearing of this Cau&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted That as to the <HI>fir&s;t Point,</HI> This is the very fir&s;t time that in all this Cau&s;e this thing was broached, and a matter of &s;uch Moment as the Defendants would make it, can|not (were it true) have &s;lipt the Defendants Memory, during all the four An&s;wers. But yet, there is nothing to that Purpo&s;e in any of the An&s;wers; and as by the An&s;wers, no &s;uch thing was a&s;&s;erted or put in i&s;&s;ue, they could not, by the Practice of the Court, examine to it. Again, it cannot well be pre|&s;umed, that &s;uch a thing could be without &s;ome Writing, or Letter, or Paper, or &s;ome Per&s;ons here who have heard it; and yet, no &s;uch thing do they pre|tend there is: But further in&s;i&s;ted, That were &s;uch agreement confe&s;&s;ed, it would be no way binding, for by the Law of Nations, and of Merchants, no Ma&s;ter of a Ve&s;&s;el (as <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> was) nor even the Owners (as the <HI>India Company</HI> were) could (either alone or both together) charge the goods freighted with them (as this Snuff of the <HI>King of Spain</HI>'s was) with any thing beyond the Freight agreed on, further than the Expences that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation thereof: Again, were that Agreement good and binding, then if <HI>Hett</HI> had the &s;ame but one Night in his Cu&s;tody, he mu&s;t have had &s;o much for it as now; and whatever Power <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> had to make that Agreement with him, he had a like Power to make it with another Per&s;on; and &s;o, after it had been a Night in <HI>Hetts</HI> Cu&s;tody, might have put it into an|thers Cu&s;tody, upon like terms, and the like with a third, fourth, fifth, &amp;c. Per&s;ons; how ab&s;urd and contrary to common Rea&s;on, &amp; the Laws of Nations and of Merchans this would be, needeth not further enlarging on. And therefore either &s;uch an Agreement never was; but if it had been, the &s;ame is void.</P>
<P>As to the 2<HI>d Point,</HI> the Complainants never did or will di&s;pute the payment of nece&s;&s;ary Charges about the Snuff; but as to <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el's</HI> Debts, no Order of his can, in Law or Rea&s;on, make another per&s;ons Good liable to the pay|ment of them: And as to his Power, it could not impower them to do what neither he nor the <HI>India Company</HI> them&s;elves could do, to &s;ell another Per&s;ons Goods, unle&s;s an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity had happened, of &s;elling a part for the Per&s;ervation of the re&s;t; which Nece&s;&s;ity has no way appeared in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the 3<HI>d,</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> 5<HI>th</HI> &amp; 6<HI>th,</HI> the proving or not proving of the&s;e Orders,
<PB N="14" REF="003019_0016_0FEFA0C3216A2F18">
cannot be material or affect this Cau&s;e, for the Rea&s;ons before; nor can it be material to prove the 7<HI>th Point,</HI> for its only proving that <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> gave them an Order, which neither Law nor Rea&s;on could ju&s;tify them in obeying: For as by the Law of Nations and of Merchants, the Owners of a Ship are an&s;wer|able for the Ma&s;ter, and all Per&s;ons to whom he &s;hall intru&s;t the goods freighted in their Ship, it mu&s;t be in their Power either to change the Ma&s;ter or Keeper of tho&s;e Goods, for &s;uch Per&s;ons as they &s;hall chu&s;e rather to tru&s;t them with.</P>
<P>As to the 8<HI>th,</HI> They acknowledged, it might be material, and rather than be delayed, they would chu&s;e to admit it to be true.</P>
<P>As to the 9<HI>th,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chabot</HI> could not be the proper Evidence of what was Shipt in the <HI>Duke of Portland,</HI> but the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Books, the Ma&s;ter and Owners here, mu&s;t be proper Evidences of the Quantity Shipt, and <HI>Chabot,</HI> could only be of the Quantity Delivered him.</P>
<P>As to the 10<HI>th,</HI> Every thing material concerning the Agreement and Bond, in the An&s;wer &s;et forth, was as well tran&s;acted with Mr. <HI>Pacheco,</HI> as <HI>De Lara</HI> and <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> &s;o that they could Examine Mr. <HI>Pacheco</HI> here upon the Spot, to that matter, who was ready to An&s;wer any Interrogatories to that purpo&s;e; and it was a&s;&s;erted, They might have Examined <HI>De Lara</HI> &amp; <HI>De Co&s;ta</HI> before they went, they having given publick Notice of their going, in the Secretary's Office, according to the Cu&s;tom of this place. So that upon the whole, they in&s;i&s;ted, This pretence of want of Commi&s;&s;ions to Examine beyond Seas, was only a pretext to delay Ju&s;tice in this cau&s;e, and the rather, for that it has been publick fame here, the&s;e many Months pa&s;t, that <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> was Ship-wreckt and lo&s;t in a Voyage for <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and his Officers being Sea-faring Men, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be ea&s;ily found, to be Examined. And further in&s;i&s;ted, That tho' the Points had been material, and were &s;et forth in the An&s;wer as true, yet it could no way be inferred from thence, that the&s;e Per&s;ons &s;et forth in the Petition, could prove the&s;e Points, Nor that there were no Per&s;ons or means here to prove them; both which they conceiv'd ought to appear to this Court, before &s;uch a delay, as almo&s;t a mounted to hanging up the Cau&s;e forever, were granted, and which, by the Rea&s;on and Practice &s;et forth in the former hearing on this matter, ought to appear to this Court; And therefore prayed, the &s;aid Petition for Commi&s;&s;ions might be Rejected.</P>
<P>And upon hearing what was alledged by the Council of both &s;ides, this Court was of opinion, That &s;ufficient Rea&s;on did not appear to grant the Commi&s;&s;ions prayed for. And thereupon the Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> produced an Affidavit made by him, to this purpo&s;e, That he is advi&s;ed by his Council, that its material and Nece&s;&s;ary for him to Examine Witne&s;&s;es in foreign Parts, to prove the afore&s;aid ten Points, and that he believes that <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> can prove all that's material for him to prove in the fir&s;t eight Articles; and that about fifteen Months ago he had a Letter from him, and has not received any account of his Decea&s;e &s;ince that time, but does believe, he is &s;till alive: That <HI>Baraule, Durand</HI> and <HI>Livodes</HI> were acquainted in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the affairs relating to the Cargo of the <HI>Victory,</HI> and believes they can materially depo&s;e to the matters contained in &s;ome of the &s;aid Articles: That he believes <HI>Chabot</HI> can Evidence the 9<HI>th Article,</HI> and <HI>De Lara</HI> and <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> the matters referred to in the 10<HI>th Article;</HI> and that he is advi&s;ed and believes, it's not &s;afe to go to hearing without Examining them to the afore&s;aid Articles; and that he believes the Intere&s;t of the Defendants is concerned in &s;uch Examination to the value of <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds.</HI> Which Affidavit was read, after &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the reading thereof, by the Complainants Council, for that it had not been filed
<PB N="15" REF="003019_0017_0FEFA0C519FDA7F0">
with the Regi&s;ter before hand, according to the practice of the Court, in order that they might have got a Copy thereof, and been prepared to &s;peak to it.</P>
<P>And thereupon it was <HI>Ordered,</HI> That the &s;ame be &s;poke to that Day three Weeks.</P>
<P>Afterwards, to wit, the &s;ixteenth Day of the &s;ame Month of <HI>September,</HI> the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> made Oath, by Affidavit filed, That there are &s;undry Facts, which he is advi&s;ed are material, to Cro&s;s-Examine the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> upon, concerning the Points of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ions and Affidavit, and that he believed the Defendant <HI>Hetts</HI> An&s;wers to Interrogatories for that purpo&s;e, would in a great mea&s;ure avoid the Rea&s;ons adduced for granting the &s;aid Com|mi&s;&s;ions; and that he knew not how otherwi&s;e to prove tho&s;e Facts, than by the An&s;wers of the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> to &s;uch Interrogatories. And on the 18th of the &s;ame Month, upon Notice duly given, the Complainants Council moved, that a Day might be prefixed for Cro&s;s-Examining the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> as afore&s;aid; and offered the Interrogatories, that the Court might judge whether they were material. And Becau&s;e the &s;aid Defendant had not purged his Contempt herein before-mentioned, moved further, That a day might be prefixed for him to appear and purge his Contempt, or that (according to the Practice of the <HI>Court of Chancery</HI> at home, to grant no favours to Per&s;ons while in Contempt) the Petition for Commi&s;&s;ions be Rejected. And that to prevent &s;urprize (as three weeks were given for a further hearing, on the De|fendants Petition for Commi&s;&s;ions) if any further Affidavit or matter of Proof, the Defendants will u&s;e to &s;upport it, moved further, That they might file it with the Regi&s;ter a week before hearing. Whereupon, the Defendant <HI>Hetts</HI> Council, an&s;wered, That it was unprecedented to Examine the Defendant in any &s;uch Ca&s;e; and that as their Affidavit was a voluntary Affidavit, which they might have cho&s;en to make, or let it alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they may chu&s;e to be Cro&s;s-Examined, or let it alone, and are not Compellable thereto. And as to the Contempt, they had paid the Co&s;ts therof to the Complainants Council, which were accepted of by them, and &s;o they had no right to move any &s;uch thing. And as to the filing &s;uch further Affidavit, as moved, they had no Objection thereto.</P>
<P>It was Replyed by the Complainants Council, That as to the Contempt, tho' they had no right to move it, yet as no Satisfaction was made to the Court, according to the Rules, the Court might, if they plea&s;ed, give order for the purging of the Contempt, and hoped the Court would, in &s;o far as the Defen|dant <HI>Hett</HI> had for &s;o long time ab&s;conded, to avoid the Ju&s;tice of the Court; and that if he did not appear, the Proceedings thereof were like to be of little effect in this ca&s;e, except only again&s;t the Fatherle&s;s Children and Widdow of <HI>Fre&s;neau.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, and upon hearing of what was alledged by the Council of both &s;ides, this Court was of Opinion, <HI>That as the Defendants Affidavit was volun|tary, he is not compellable, but may chu&s;e to be cro&s;s-examined concerning the Facts thereof, or not:</HI> But at the &s;ame time the Defendants declining &s;uch Cro&s;s-Ex|amination, takes off the Force of the Affidavit, in &s;o far as the Exception to the &s;ame &s;eemeth ju&s;t. And in regard the Defendant ab&s;conds, to <HI>avoid the Ju&s;tice of this Court,</HI> and the Practice at Home appears to be, as alledged by the Complainants, it is Ordered, <HI>That unle&s;s on</HI> Friday <HI>fortnight next, be Per|&s;onally appear in this Court, to purge his Contempt afore&s;aid, his Petition for Com|mi&s;&s;ions be Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</HI> And it is further Ordered, <HI>That the Defendant file with the Regi&s;ter &s;uch further Matter of Proof as shall be u&s;ed to &s;upport the &s;aid Petition, a Week before the day of further Hearing thereof</HI></P>

And (according to Notice given) it was further moved, That a &s;hort Day might be appointed for Publication in this Cau&s;e, in regard the Complainant <HI>Pacheco</HI> only waited in this Province for the I&s;&s;ue of this Suit, as by Affidavit appeared. Whereupon it was alledged by the Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> That neither the &s;aid <HI>Rene Hett,</HI> his Council, Sollicitor or Clerk in Court, had been &s;erved with the la&s;t Order, and therefore the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI>'s not appearing Per&s;onally in Court, ought not to barr him from having Commi&s;&s;ions to Examine, as prayed by his Petition.

<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge V.</LABEL>
It is &s;aid by <HI>Richard Nicholls</HI> Depo&s;ition to the 23d Interrogatory, That immediately after the Money of the Account was paid, <HI>Abraham Gouverneur</HI> pulled a Paper out of his Pocket, and read it to the Bearers, and &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t enter into a Bond of the &s;ame Conditions;</HI> and <HI>Hett</HI> then &s;aid, <HI>If they would Execute that Bond, they might begin to Weigh, if it was the next day;</HI> That <HI>Pacheco,</HI> &s;aid to the Deponent, he thought the Snuff &s;hould be delivered as &s;oon as the Payment was made, and that now he was at a Lo&s;s what to do, or to that purpo&s;e.

<P>As to the 26 <HI>Article of</HI> 65 <HI>l.</HI> the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> &s;ays, in his 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 63. That it was &s;undry Tavern Expences paid at &s;undry times in Treats of the Court Lawyers, and others concerned in this Affair, and that the whole was Computed by him&s;elf and <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> to amount to 65 <HI>l.</HI> Which being ex|cepted to, for that the 7th Article of 48 <HI>l.</HI> 14<HI>s.</HI> 1&frac12; <HI>d.</HI> was not di&s;puted by the Complainants for Charges, and that it could hardly be that they were put to both the&s;e Sums in Expences, therefore the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in his 3<HI>d An|&s;wer, fol.</HI> 2. &s;ays, That the 65 <HI>l.</HI> Charges accrued after the 7th Article had been allowed of by the Court of Admiralty, which by the procedings thereof
<PB N="23" REF="003019_0025_0FEFA0DE1972F038">
appear to be on the acquittal of the Tobaccoes. And theron it was Obe&s;rved, That in the nature of things, it was hardly Po&s;&s;ible, and far from Probable, that after &s;entence, when either Court or Lawyers had little to do in the Affair, the Defendants could be at &s;o much Charge in treating of them: Which com|pared with the Depo&s;ition of <HI>Andrew Hamilton,</HI> to the Twelvth Interrogatory, who &s;aith, That he does not remember that he ever put &s;aid <HI>Hett</HI> &amp; <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> or either of them, to any Expen&s;e in a Tavern, unle&s;&s; that one night he was at a &s;upper, which he thinks might be &s;ome very &s;mall Expen&s;e to them. And that all this taken together, &s;hows the Improbability of &s;o much being Depended, as is &s;aid in this Article.</P>
<P>As to the 28<HI>th</HI> Article of <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> paid to the Pilot of the <HI>Victory,</HI> the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> acknowledges in <HI>fol.</HI> 76. of his 2<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> That he only paid 4 <HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> tho' he took a Receipt for <HI>Ten Pounds.</HI></P>

<P>As to the 40<HI>th,</HI> 41<HI>&s;t</HI> &amp; 42<HI>d Articles,</HI> on the face of the Account, it appears that 230 days <HI>Negro-hire,</HI> does not come to 40<HI>l.</HI> as charged in the 40<HI>th Article,</HI> As to which the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> &s;ays, in his 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 83 &amp; 86. <HI>That Cartage and Po&s;ts to &s;upport the Ware-hou&s;e mu&s;t be included, &amp; that the</HI> Negro-hire <HI>was to turn the Snuff after a Storm, that much damaged it, and denys it was done with the fraudalent view of chu&s;ing the be&s;t Snuff to Ship off for</HI> Holland <HI>and</HI> England.

<P>As to the 42<HI>d Article,</HI> the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> &s;ays, in his 2d An&s;wer, from <HI>fol.</HI> 92, to 94. That Ozenbrigs were then 15<HI>d. per yard,</HI> That he bought them a <HI>Penny-worth,</HI> and being a Shop-keeper might take a rea&s;onable Advantage on them; confe&s;&s;es he bought 771 Ells thereof of Mr. <HI>Delancy</HI> for 12 <HI>d. per Ell,</HI> and 967 Ells of <HI>Nunez</HI> at 12&frac12; <HI>d,</HI> and the remainder of <HI>Bryer</HI> at 16 <HI>d,</HI> and &s;ome Tents were u&s;ed to this purpo&s;e.

And in his 4<HI>th An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 11 to 13. confe&s;&s;es of whom the Tents were bought, and when they and the Ozenbrigs were paid for, and that what was &s;aid in his 3<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> to be Six Tents, <HI>Twelve Pounds,</HI> &s;hould have been for Twelve Tents, <HI>Six Pounds.</HI> As to which, <HI>John Scott</HI> in his Depo&s;ition to the 18th Interroga|tory &s;aith, That no Ozenbrigs that he knew of were u&s;ed about the Bags, but a cheaper &s;ort of Linnen, called <HI>Hartfords,</HI> and &s;ome old Tents, and that &s;aid Linnen and Tents were u&s;ed for patching and covering &s;aid Bags; and he &s;ays, that many Bags were needle&s;sly covered, and &s;ome were covered which
<PB N="24" REF="003019_0026_0FEFA0DFABA0FDB8">
wanted only patching; and he &s;ays, That &s;uch as at fir&s;t wanted Patching or Covering, were patched &amp; covered by the joynt order of Mr. <HI>Hett</HI> &amp; <HI>Fre&s;neau;</HI> &amp; afterwards, Mr. <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> ob&s;erving that Mr. <HI>Hett</HI> would have more Bags cover|ed than wanted it, did oppo&s;e the doing of the &s;ame, to which Mr. <HI>Hett</HI> replyed, <HI>I will cover my own half, and put the Profit in my own Pocket;</HI> and that <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> &s;aid, he could not An&s;wer the doing &s;o. And <HI>Jo&s;eph Jamain</HI> in his Depo&s;ition to the &s;ame Interrogatory &s;aith, That he believes the Snuff might have been pre&s;erved without covering the Bags a new with new Stuff, but cannot tell who ordered &s;aid Bags to be new covered, but has heard that Mr. <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> did oppo&s;e the new covering the &s;ame, and that he told Mr. <HI>Hett, That it was not fair to put Money in his Pocket thereby.</HI> And it further appears by the Certificate herein-before-mentioned, of the Deputy Weigh Ma&s;ter, That there were 804 of the Bags delivered to the Complainants, which were covered, and no more; and upon the whole of the&s;e three Articles, it was ob&s;erved, there was not only a very great Over-charge, but hardly fair dealing in <HI>Hett</HI> concerning them; and that by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nations,</HI> of <HI>Merchants</HI> and of <HI>Common Rea&s;on,</HI> no more than the nece&s;&s;ary Charge ought in this ca&s;e to be allowed.</P>
<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge XIII.</LABEL>
As to which, the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> &s;ays, in his 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 90. <HI>That</HI> D' Ro&s;&s;el <HI>gave directions to make &s;uch Pre&s;ents as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y should think fit.</HI> Whereupon it was ob&s;erved, That <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el</HI> had no power him&s;elf to make Pre&s;ents of ano|ther Per&s;ons Goods, and &s;o if they could &s;how directions from him to this purpo&s;e, they could be of no u&s;e; and had they any &s;uch directions, it would have been rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed they would have had them in writing, which they don't pretend to have; and that 17&frac12; <HI>per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions are charged for makeing the&s;e Imbezlements, is apparent by in&s;pection of the Account.</P>
<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge XIV.</LABEL>
Its admitted by the An&s;wers, there can be no di&s;pute but that the Com|mi&s;&s;ions ought to be &s;o reduced.</P>
<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge XV.</LABEL>
As to this matter, the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in his <HI>fir&s;t An&s;wer,</HI> from <HI>fol.</HI> 20 to 27. &s;ets forth, That Commi&s;&s;ions at <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> were talkt of with the Complainants before the acceptance of the Agreement at <HI>Paris,</HI> That the Com|plainant <HI>Pacheco</HI> &s;aid, It was too much, but &s;aid, if he could prove that any Merchant in <HI>New-York,</HI> had &s;o much he &s;hould have it; that he after-wards &s;howed them a Cetificate of two per&s;ons that they had <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for Delivery, with which its there &s;aid, the Complainants were &s;atisfied. On which it was ob&s;erved, That no Proof being of this matter, it is as if no &s;uch thing had been; &amp; it was theron further ob&s;erved, That no other Commi&s;&s;ions what&s;oever are mentioned in the fir&s;t An&s;wer, than that <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> and would the Defendants have been &s;atisfied with that, it would not have been a Di&s;pute here. Again, the Defendants in their 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 79. &s;ay, They do believe, that by the Cu&s;tom of Merchants <HI>Two and a half per Cent.</HI> is u&s;ually allowed for &s;toreage, tho' the goods received by the Factor were immediatly &s;old and Delivered, and never actually put in any Store-Hou&s;e, but
<PB N="25" REF="003019_0027_0FEFA0E218A9B498">
here the Store-Rent came to more than the Storeage. Again, the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in <HI>fol.</HI> 90. of 2<HI>d An&s;wer</HI> &s;aith, That by the Cu&s;tom of Merchants, he believes, its u&s;ual to charge <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for receiving, and <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for Delivery, and <HI>Two and half per Cent.</HI> for &s;toreage, tho' perhaps the goods are not detained one day in the Cu&s;tody of the Factor. On which it was ob&s;erved, That no Proof was of this, and that if there had been, yet it mu&s;t be when Goods are &s;ent to a Factor to &s;ell, and if tho&s;e Goods he &s;hould hap|pen to &s;ell the &s;ame day he receives them, and make Returns of the Price the &s;ame day, then <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for the Sales, and <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for the Returns, and <HI>Two and a half per Cent.</HI> for the Storeage, its agreed is u&s;ual; but this is no &s;uch Ca&s;e; for the&s;e Tobacco's were never put into their hands for any &s;uch Purpo&s;e as to &s;ell or make Returns of them, and for no other purpo&s;e, but the &s;afe-keeping of them till called for, and Commi&s;&s;ions for the &s;afe-keeping, and no other, could or ought to be demanded in this ca&s;e. That if barely for receiving and Delivery <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions were due, then every Per|&s;on thro' who&s;e hands goods once came, ought to have the &s;ame, the Con&s;e|quence and ab&s;urdity whereof, could not be hard to &s;ee.</P>
<P>Again, the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in the 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 102 &amp; 103. &s;aith, That by the Cu&s;tom of Merchants, he believes he can fully Ju&s;tifie his de|mand of <HI>Seven and a half per Cent.</HI> for Commi&s;&s;ions and Storeage, and &s;ays, That the Complainants did freely, and without Compul&s;ion, agree to pay the &s;ame before their Acceptation afore&s;aid, in manner as in fir&s;t An&s;wer is &s;et forth.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was ob&s;erved, That the Defendant here brings the Agree|ment of the Complainants to &s;upport that Cu&s;tom of Merchants; but, as was ob&s;erved before, there is not a word mentioned in the <HI>fir&s;t An&s;wer</HI> of more Commi&s;&s;ions than of <HI>five per Cent.</HI> And as to the Cu&s;tom of Merchants, it was in&s;i&s;ted, That none &s;uch was proven, and for the Rea&s;ons before, no &s;uch Cu&s;tom could be.</P>
<P>Again, the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in <HI>fol.</HI> 105. of the 2<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> &s;aith, <HI>That he verily believes, and doubts not but that he shall be able to prove, that it is agreeable to the U&s;age of Merchants in</HI> New-York, <HI>in &s;uch ca&s;es where goods are received, tho' they are not &s;old, but delivered over by the Order of the Employer, to a third Per&s;on, to charge &s;o much as he has charged.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which it was ob&s;erved, That no &s;ucn U&s;age appeared; but if it did, it could only be when Goods were put into a Merchants hands to &s;ell, and in that ca&s;e, tho' not &s;old, yet as he was willing to &s;ell them, and had been at pains to &s;how them (perhaps to many People) for Sale, it was but rea&s;onable in that ca&s;e to charge the Commi&s;&s;ions for &s;toreage and Sale, (which is <HI>Seven and half per Cent.</HI>) upon delivery over of the goods to the owner or another Fac|tor, if no default was in him that they were not &s;old before. And that the Cu&s;tom might be &s;o, in that ca&s;e, they admitted; but that this Ca&s;e was not like it, the goods here being never put into their hands for Sale, nor could they be at any trouble in &s;howing them to buyers, or bargaining about them, which is a great part of the cau&s;e for which Commi&s;&s;ions are drawn; and therefore if this were proven, it would not ju&s;tify <HI>Seven and a half per Cent.</HI> in this ca&s;e, and far Le&s;s <HI>Twelve and a half per Cent.</HI> as is charged; and in&s;i&s;ted, that the knavery appearing in this ca&s;e, and the not keeping or making away with the Accounts, ought in Rea&s;on to Deprive them of Commi&s;&s;ions (were they other|wi&s;e due) for Commi&s;&s;ions would &s;eem only due to tho&s;e who have hone&s;tly performed, or endeavoured to perform, the &s;ervice for which the Com|mi&s;&s;ions
<PB N="26" REF="003019_0028_0FEFA0E46538D2E8">
are demanded. And further, the Complainants Council in&s;i&s;ted on the Arguments herein before &s;et forth, on the <HI>fir&s;t Point,</HI> to which the De|fendant <HI>Hett</HI> prayed Commi&s;&s;ions to Examine beyond &s;ea; and on the whole, in&s;i&s;ted, That only Commi&s;&s;ions of <HI>Two and a half per Cent.</HI> for &s;toreage, and what the &s;toreage might exceed the Commi&s;&s;ions, and what was rea&s;onable for Pains, care and labour about the Snuff, ought to be allowed of, in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge XVI.</LABEL>
Upon this the Defendants in their 2<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> from <HI>fol.</HI> 9 to 16. &s;et forth, a Letter of Attorney to <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> and <HI>Hett,</HI> dated the 29<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1719. from Capt. <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el,</HI> whereby he makes them his Attorneys to receive all Moneys, Goods, &amp;c. due to him in this Province, and to pro&s;ecute the Suit in the Admiralty, about the Snuff and Tobacco, as al&s;o &s;undry Sums of Money and Ambergreefe, and to u&s;e all lawful, means for the Recovery thereof, and upon Receipt thereof, to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ame for his u&s;e, and to pay and di&s;charge all Co&s;ts and Charges relating to and concerning the &s;ame; and that by virtue of that Power, they di&s;po&s;ed of &s;undry Parcels for defraying the nece&s;&s;ary Charges.</P>
<P>As to which, it was in&s;i&s;ted, from the Rea&s;ons of the Argument of the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, upon the <HI>fir&s;t Point</HI> which the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> would have examined to beyond Seas, That neither the <HI>India Company</HI> nor <HI>D' Ro&s;&s;el</HI> could them&s;elves &s;ell any of the &s;aid Tobacco's, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of an ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;elling a part for the Pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t; and therefore their Letter of Attorney could give no more Power than they had.</P>
<P>Again, the An&s;wers &s;et forth, <HI>That</HI> Hett <HI>&amp;</HI> Fre&s;neau, <HI>by the Cu&s;tom of Mer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, had Power to &s;ell to pay nece&s;&s;ary Charges.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which it was ob&s;erved, That in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, for Pre|&s;ervation of the re&s;t, a part might be &s;old: or if the Owner will not, upon pro|per application, pay Freight and nece&s;&s;ary Charges: in the&s;e ca&s;es the Cu&s;tom alledged, was admitted, and denyed in any other. But here was neither an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ell a part for the Pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t, nor any refu&s;al of Payment of Nece&s;&s;ary charges, but on the contrary, it appears in 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 17 &amp; 18. by a Letter from the <HI>India Company,</HI> there &s;et forth, dated the 14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> 1722. wherein they Promi&s;ed to <HI>Hett</HI> &amp; <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> that they &s;hould be exactly reimbur&s;ed all their Charges concerning the &s;aid Tobacco's.</P>
<P>And it further appears by the Account and An&s;wers, and the Letters of <HI>Hett</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> that they on the 22d of <HI>March,</HI> 1721-2. drew Bills for Two Hundred Pounds Sterling, on the Company, which its confe&s;&s;ed were paid; and from thence it was inferred, that as the <HI>India Company</HI> Promi&s;ed to reim|bur&s;e them, and &s;o far as they drew, paid; There nothing can appear but that the <HI>India Company</HI> would in like manner have paid all the other charges.</P>
<P>As to which, its &s;et forth in the 2<HI>d An&s;wer, fol.</HI> 21. That tho' the Bill for Two Hundred Pounds was paid, yet it was not till about ten Months after the Company had Promi&s;ed to pay it, which di&s;couraged them from drawing any more Bills, and from that time forward, Sold Snuff here to rai&s;e Money, in&s;tead of drawing Bills.</P>

As to this, the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> affixes to his 2<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> a Schedule, which in <HI>fol.</HI> 119. he &s;ays, <HI>He believes to be a true &amp; full Account of the Snuff receiv'd by the &s;aid</HI> Fre&s;neau &amp; Hett, <HI>and applied to their u&s;e, allowances being made for the Damage thereof.</HI> Which Schedule contains 137 Bags, weighing Neat 20628 <HI>l.</HI> whereof above eighty of the Bags appear to weigh under one Hundred and a half, many only one Hundred, and none of them above two Hundred. To which al&s;o is affixed an Account of Sales of ten Bags of them by <HI>Vanwys</HI> and <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> weighing there gro&s;s 1934.

Al&s;o, an Account of 31 Bags &s;old to <HI>Richards</HI> and <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> here at the Ma&s;t, weighing Neat 5511. Upon which it was in&s;i&s;ted and ob&s;erved, That when the account &s;hould come to be &s;ettled before a Ma&s;ter of this Court, they were able to prove the <HI>Dutch Weight</HI> to be <HI>Eight per Cent.</HI> heavier than the <HI>English,</HI> and if &s;o, then it would plainly ap|pear, that the&s;e four Articles being only 111 Bags weighed more than the whole 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7 Bags, wherof they are &s;aid to be a part, by the weight of four or five Bags, and that therefore &s;hort Credit of about 30 Bags is given in this one Article of the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7 Bags, and that upon the pretence of taking it to them&s;elves, and mak|ing allowances for damage.</P>

And by the Depo&s;ition of <HI>Thomas Hammond,</HI> it ap|pears, that in the year 1724&punc; on or about the Month of <HI>October,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rene Hett</HI> in Company with Mr. <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> propo&s;ed to him, That if he would take any Snuff on board, on his, <HI>Hett's</HI> account, the Deponent &s;hould have half of the neat produce of what he &s;old for, not mentioning any quantity, that being left to the Deponent to take what he plea&s;ed: That the Deponent re|plyed, <HI>He would not do any &s;uch thing, for the con&s;equence thereof would be dangerous to his Captain and him&s;elf.</HI> Upon which Proofs, it was in&s;i&s;ted, That tho' they don't expre&s;ly prove that the Snuff &s;o &s;hipt off for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and offered to be &s;hipt, as above, was of the Cargo of the Ship <HI>Victory,</HI> depo&s;it|ed as afore&s;aid, yet con&s;idering &s;o great a Wantage there is of it, as before appears, and the &s;everal fraudulent and &s;ecret Circum&s;tances by the&s;e Proofs, and other the Proofs before, to the other Charges, appearing, and that there's no Proof that the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> had, or that this was of any other Snuff, and that had it been of any other Snuff, there was no need of &s;uch di&s;gui&s;es
<PB N="32" REF="003019_0034_0FEFA0F36CAA99D0">
and &s;ecrecy; for no Man can be afraid or a&s;hamed to own what is his own; and that People are generally more &s;aving of their own Effects, than to offer one half of the neat produce for the Sale of them; and that from thence, there's the mo&s;t violent Pre&s;umption (which amounts to full Proof) that this, as well as the twenty Barrels concealed at <HI>Bieus,</HI> was of the Cargo of the <HI>Victory,</HI> depo&s;ited as afore&s;aid; and al&s;o, there's a like pre&s;umption, that the re&s;t of the Snuff wanting, has been in &s;uch fraudulent manner concealed and made away with; and that therefore Notwith&s;tanding of the &s;everal po&s;itive Denyals upon Oath, by the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> in his An&s;wers, of the matters of this 19<HI>th</HI> Charge, the &s;ame appears fully to be made good.</P>
<P><LABEL>Proof of Charge XIX.</LABEL>
As to this, It appears confe&s;&s;ed by the Defendants <HI>An&s;wers,</HI> That Mer|chandize was bought in <HI>Holland</HI> for the price of the Snuff &s;hipped by <HI>Hett</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;neau;</HI> that they had other Moneys there at that time, with which goods were al&s;o bought, and &s;o it came to be mixt in their Trade afterwards, &s;o that they can't render an Account of the Profits by Trade there-with. And from Authorities &s;hown, it was in&s;i&s;ted on to be apparent, That it was the antient Law of <HI>England,</HI> and that its now the continued Cour&s;e of the Chancery at home, to compel Executors and Tru&s;tees trading with the Te&s;tators or En|tru&s;ters Money, or letting it to Intere&s;t, to account for the Profits of the Trade, or to pay &s;uch Intere&s;t; and that the Laws of Nature and Nations, and of common Rea&s;on, were accordingly: And that all the Rea&s;on of the&s;e ca&s;es, was here, and much more, in &s;o far as &s;o great a number of <HI>Frauds, Perjuries</HI> and <HI>foul-Dealings</HI> do Evidently appear in this ca&s;e, be&s;ide what fur|ther may be pre&s;umed; and &s;o great a number of <HI>Contrivances</HI> of <HI>Delay</HI> and <HI>Vexation</HI> to tne Complainants, in the Cour&s;e of this Suit, to hinder the com|ing at Ju&s;tice, that the like of both, has not in any one ca&s;e, in all Pro|bability, ever appeared.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, and hearing what could be alledged by the Council for the Complainants, and for the Executors of <HI>Andrew Fre&s;neau</HI> (the Defendant <HI>Hetts</HI> Council not attending, as afore&s;aid) and upon mature Deliberation had thereon, this Court was of Opinion, and did Order and Decree accordingly.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Decreed on.</LABEL>
THAT the fir&s;t Eight Charges in the Bill appeared to be &s;ufficiently made good, and therefore, that the Defendants do come to a fair account with the Complainants.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge IX. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That Notwith&s;tanding the Probabilities, Rea&s;ons, Arguments and Ca&s;e cited, to make good this Charge, this Court cannot determine that <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el</HI> did as is charged.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge X. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That what Charges appear to have accrued upon the <HI>French</HI> Goods &s;eparately,
<PB N="33" REF="003019_0035_0FEFA0F5001C1F38">
ought not to be charged upon the <HI>Spanish Tobacco's;</HI> but what was jointly upon both, this Court &s;eeth no method by which a proportion can be made; and had not the <HI>French Goods</HI> been joined, it appeareth not but that there might have been the &s;ame Charge upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> alone.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XI. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That &s;uch Debts as were contracted by Charges in Defence of the <HI>Spanish Tobacco's,</HI> by <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el,</HI> and paid by the Defendants &s;ince his departure, ought to be Chargeable on the <HI>Spanish Tobacco's,</HI> but his other Debts not Chargeable thereon.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XII. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That &s;uch part of the Articles as appear to have been, <HI>bona fide,</HI> paid on account of the <HI>Spanish Tobacco's,</HI> be allowed.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XIII. Decreed on.</LABEL>
If, <HI>bona fide,</HI> given for &s;ervices concerning the <HI>Spanish Tobacco's,</HI> the gifts to be allowed, but not the <HI>Seventeen and a half per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions, other|wi&s;e than as herein after directed.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XIV. Decreed on.</LABEL>
No Di&s;pute about.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XV. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That neither the <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for Receiving the Snuff and Tobacco, nor the <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> for the Delivery thereof, ought to be allowed the Defendants, but that what is Rea&s;onable for their Pains, Care and Labour about the &s;ame, be allowed, with Rea&s;onable Storeage.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XVI. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That the Sales of the Tobacco and Snuff appear to be <HI>Fraudulent,</HI> &amp; made without &s;ufficient Power, and no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of making them for the Pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t; and therefore no Commi&s;&s;ions, for making the Sales, ought to be allowed.</P>
<P><LABEL>Charge XVII. &amp; XVIII. Decreed on.</LABEL>
That the Defendants be accountable for all the Snuff that came to the hands of <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> and <HI>Hett,</HI> and not delivered to the Complainants, rea&s;onable Allowance being made for Wa&s;ting and Du&s;ting: And that the twenty Casks of Snuff, now in the Cu&s;tody of <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters of this Court, which was concealed in the Cellar of Mrs. <HI>Bieu,</HI> by the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> be delivered to the Complainants, as part of the wanting Snuff.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="003019_0036_0FEFA0FA3566C2D8"><LABEL>Charge XIX.</LABEL>
That the Defendants &s;hall not account for the Profits they made by Trading with the Moneys ari&s;ing by their Sales of the Snuff in <HI>Holland</HI> &amp; <HI>England,</HI> But for the neat Produce thereof, and the Intere&s;t of &s;o much thereof as over paid them from &s;uch time, as it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;aid Moneys ari&s;ing by the &s;aid Sales, might be received here, until they &s;hall pay the &s;ame; and that the Defendants be allowed Intere&s;t for the Moneys advanced by them, till they were repaid the &s;ame. And that &s;uch Sum or Sums of Money as ap|pear wrongfully to have been received by the Defendants, from the Com|plainants, or any of them, that the Defendants account for the &s;ame, with Intere&s;t from the time the &s;ame was received, till it is repaid. But that the Executors of <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> be chargeable with no more of the <HI>Thirteen hundred and Ninety &s;even Pounds eighteen Shillings</HI> &amp; <HI>three Pence,</HI> paid by the Complainants to the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> than for what came to the &s;aid Executors hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further Orders of the Court.</NOTE>And this Court was further of Opinion, That what ap|pears to be the &s;eperate Tran&s;actions alone of <HI>Hett,</HI> he alone is to be accountable for the &s;ame; and in like manner of <HI>Fre&s;neau;</HI> But that, what &s;hall not appear to have been &s;eperately Tran&s;|acted, they &s;hall be joyntly and &s;everally chargeable therewith.</P>
<P>And in regard that it appears by the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI>'s own &s;howing, in his <HI>fir&s;t An&s;wer,</HI> that no more Commi&s;&s;ions than that of <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> was pre|tended to be agreed about, between him and the Complainants, and that he was only to receive the Charges in Ca&s;h, &amp; to take Bond for the Commi&s;&s;ions, and that the 1397 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> was pretended to be the charges, and yet above <HI>Seven and a half per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions do appear in the body of that account, which Account, by the further An&s;wers and Proofs, appears not to have been &s;hown to the Complainants, till paid by them, and therefore had there been &s;uch an Agreement as is &s;et forth in the <HI>fir&s;t An&s;wer</HI> (which is not proved) it was a mainfe&s;t <HI>Fraud</HI> and Impo&s;ition, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to take <HI>Seven and a half per Cent.</HI> in Ca&s;h for Commi&s;&s;ions, when only <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> was (pretended to be) agreed about, and afterwards to in&s;i&s;t on and take Bond for the &s;ame thing, &s;o before paid in Ca&s;h, and over paid; and it being agreeable to the Rules of na|tural Equity and Ju&s;tice, that no man take benefit by his own <HI>Frauds,</HI> Im|po&s;itions and unju&s;t Actions, and to Relieve Per&s;ons deceived, from Cheats and Impo&s;itions put upon them; and it being &s;hown to this Court, by the continued Practice of the Court of Chancery of <HI>England,</HI> that Relief is there had again&s;t Bonds, Deeds or any other Writings what&s;oever, where <HI>Fraud</HI> and Impo&s;ition was the Cau&s;e of the making them; and that in Ca&s;es much Le&s;s apparent than this, and becau&s;e none of the matters &s;et forth in any of the Defendants <HI>four An&s;wers,</HI> appear proved to ju&s;tify this pretence of <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions for Receiveing and delivering the Tobacco's depo&s;ited with <HI>Hett</HI> &amp; <HI>Fre&s;neau</HI> (for <HI>Five per Cent.</HI> whereof, its confe&s;&s;ed, this Bond was granted) &amp; for that the pretence of an Agreement by <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el</HI> to pay tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions, &s;et forth in the Defendant <HI>Hetts</HI> Affidavit, in order to entitle him to Commi&s;&s;ions to Examine beyond Seas, &s;eemeth very Improbable, in &s;o far as no Writting or Proof is pretended to prove that Agreement, but the Ex|amining of <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el;</HI> and that had &s;uch an Agreement been, its unlikely that it &s;hould have been forgot in every one of the <HI>four An&s;wers</HI> of the Defendant
<PB N="35" REF="003019_0037_0FEFA0FCFA454068">
<HI>Hett;</HI> And for that were it proved, its apparent, that neither the <HI>India Company</HI> nor <HI>D'Ro&s;&s;el</HI> had Power to charge the&s;e Tobacco's with any thing further than the nece&s;&s;ary Charges concerning the &s;ame, and &s;o &s;uch Agreement would be Void, as being made by one who had no Power to make it. And upon the whole, this Court was further of Opinion, and did therefore Order &amp; Decree, That the Bond entered into by <HI>Pacheco, De Lara</HI> and <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> in 1500 <HI>l.</HI> to the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> dated the 25th of <HI>November,</HI> 1725.

And it was further Ordered and Decreed, That the Sheriff of <HI>New-York</HI> do bring into this Court to be Cancelled, the Bail Bond entered into by the Complainant <HI>Pacheco,</HI> and his Securities, upon the Pro&s;ecution there again&s;t him, upon the &s;aid Bond to <HI>Hett;</HI> and that the <HI>Ne Exeat</HI> again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Pacheco</HI> be di&s;&s;olved; and that the Sheriff do deliver up the Security, taken thereon, to be Cancelled; And that the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> do pay to the Complainants, their Co&s;ts at Law, and in Equity, occa&s;ioned by the Pro&s;ecu|tion of the afore&s;aid Bond and <HI>Ne Exeat;</HI> and that the Defendants do pay to the Complainants the full Co&s;ts of this Suit.</P>
<P>And it was then referred to <HI>Robert Lurting</HI> and <HI>Cadwallader Colden,</HI> E&s;qrs. to &s;ettle the &s;aid Accounts, according to the directions of this Court, and to tax the Co&s;ts, and to make Report thereof to this Court, with all convenient Expedition.</P>
<P>Which Matters &s;o Decreed and Ordered, as afore&s;aid, were ordered to be Ab&s;olute, in &s;o far as the &s;ame was again&s;t the Executors of <HI>Fre&s;neau;</HI> But in regard that no Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> appeared, the &s;ame were only to be Ab&s;olute again&s;t the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> if no &s;ufficient Cau&s;e was &s;hewed, either to this Court, to the contrary, on the Twenty third Day of the &s;aid Month of <HI>December</HI> (his Excellency being to depart the next day thereafter for his Government of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>) Or to the Ma&s;ters to whom the &s;aid Matters were referred, upon their Second Summons.</P>

<P>IN Obedience to your Excellency's Orders in <HI>Chancery,</HI> of the 21<HI>&s;t</HI> and 22<HI>d</HI> days of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, referring to us the Settlement of the Accounts in this Cau&s;e, According to the Directions of the &s;aid Orders, We proceeded to the Settlement of the &s;ame, and the 30<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, was appointed by a &s;econd Summons from us, for the Parties to attend us, for that purpo&s;e; when the Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> &s;howed Cau&s;e again&s;t the Decree, by a Writing by them delivered to us, in the&s;e words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e he hath not Examined his Witne&s;&s;es, to prove the &s;everal Matters alledged in his &s;everal <HI>An&s;wers,</HI> being deprived of that Priviledge, by the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his Petition pre&s;ented to the Court for that purpo&s;e, whereby he was utterly di&s;abled to make his Defence, which being yet al|lowed, would enable him fully &s;o to do.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e the twenty Casks of Snuff, now in the Cu&s;tody of <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which are &s;aid to have been concealed in the Cellar of Mrs. <HI>Bieu,</HI> by the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> are ordered to be delivered to the Complainants, as part of the wanting Snuff, whereas it doth not appear there is any Snuff wanting, rea&s;onable allowance being made for Wa&s;teage and Du&s;t; and al&s;o, becau&s;e the &s;aid Twenty Casks are no where mentioned in, nor prayed for by the Bill, nor does it appear that they are any part of the Snuff pretended to be wanted in the &s;aid Bill of the Complainants.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Cau&s;es, we conceived our &s;elves no ways ob|liged to take any notice thereof, being a thing &s;et forth to have been adjudged by your Excellency. As to the <HI>Second Cau&s;e,</HI> It appears to us by the Proceed|ings in this Cau&s;e, before hearing (and which by the Orders afore&s;aid, are &s;aid to have appeared on hearing) that after allowance for Wa&s;ting &amp; Du&s;ting, and other proper allowances, and after &s;ub&s;tracting the twenty Casks of Snuff concealed at <HI>Bieu's,</HI> there &s;till remains 2532 Pounds Weight of Snuff want|ing, as more fully appears by the Account of the Snuff hereunto annex'd, Marked <HI>No.</HI> 1. And therefore, that the <HI>Second Cau&s;e</HI> was of no weight. We therefore gave a third Summons for the Partys to attend us on the Eighth day of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, and a fourth to attend as on the Twelfth day of the &s;ame Month; on all which Summon&s;es the Complainants Council appeared, but none in behalf of either of the Defendants, at any of the&s;e times, except on the &s;econd Summons, to deliver us the Writting afore&s;aid, tho' every of the &s;aid Summon&s;es appeared to us by Oath, to be duly &s;erved. That therefore we proceeded to &s;ettle the Accounts <HI>Ex parte,</HI> as they appeared, gathered from the Proceedings in the Cau&s;e, according to the Directions in the Orders of the Court afore&s;aid, except in this, that the Complainants and their Council did
<PB N="37" REF="003019_0039_0FEFA104A0F10F48">
allow of &s;undry Articles and parts of Articles to &s;tand charged in the Defendants Account, without making any objection to them, tho' no &s;ufficient Proof ap|pears in the Proceedings, that the&s;e Sums were paid, nor of any rea&s;onable cau&s;e for which they might have been paid, and that only from the Po&s;&s;ibility that &s;ome &s;uch Sums might have been paid by the Defendants, for the&s;e pur|po&s;es; and al&s;o, Except in this, that it not appearing clearly when the Sums paid out by the Defendants, were paid out; and it al&s;o not appearing clearly by the Proceedings, when the produce of the Sales came into the Defendants hands, and becau&s;e of the Intricacy that mu&s;t of cour&s;e ari&s;e there-from, to compute the Intere&s;t to the Partys to whom, from time to time, a Ballance was due: By the con&s;ent of the <HI>Complainants</HI> &amp; their <HI>Council,</HI> we have not con&s;ider'd of this Article, further than to find that the Ballances were mo&s;tly again&s;t the Defendants, and that &s;eeing the Complainants were willing to wave that ad|vantage, we were wiling to &s;ave our &s;elves the trouble of computing how much the Intere&s;t of the Ballances amounted to until the payment of the 1397 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> by the Complainants to the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> before which, we find, there was a Ballance due to the Complainants of <HI>Eighty two Pounds</HI> and <HI>One Penny,</HI> the Intere&s;t whereof the Complainants were al&s;o willing to wave till the date of the Decretal Order (the Complainants however prote&s;t|ing that the&s;e Allowances and Wavings of theirs might be no Barr to them to Di&s;pute the&s;e Matters, if the Defendants appeared, but that they might in&s;i&s;t on their whole Due, if they &s;hould then &s;o think it proper) and therefore we have only computed Intere&s;t upon the &s;aid 1397 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> till the Decretal Order; and upon the whole, con&s;idered, as afore&s;aid, we find that on the twenty &s;econd day of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, the Defendants owed the Complainants (be&s;ides the Delivering up of the 1500<HI>l.</HI> Bond for Commi&s;&s;ions of Delivery) the Sum of <HI>Seventeen hundred</HI> &amp; <HI>Eleven Pounds, Seventeen Shillings</HI> &amp; <HI>One Penny,</HI> as the Ballance of the Accounts &s;tated, as by the Account annexed, marked <HI>No.</HI> 2. Plainly will appear.</P>
<P>We do al&s;o find, that the Defendant <HI>Hett</HI> was &s;olely chargeable with <HI>Fourteen Hundred</HI> and <HI>Seven Pounds Fourteen Shillings</HI> and <HI>Four Pence half Penny</HI> of the &s;aid Ballance of <HI>Seventeen Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eleven Pounds Seventeen Shillings</HI> and <HI>One Penny,</HI> and that the Executors of <HI>Fre&s;neau,</HI> decea&s;ed, are &s;olely Charge|able with the Sum of <HI>Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Ninety One Pounds Ten Shillings</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>And we find the Defendants, jointly and &s;everally Chargeable with <HI>Twelve Pounds Twelve Shillings</HI> and <HI>Eight Pence half Penny,</HI> the remainder of the &s;aid Ballance, as plainly will appear by the Account annexed, marked <HI>No.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>The Accounts having appeared to us in &s;ub&s;tance, as afore&s;aid, we on the Fourteenth of this In&s;tant <HI>February,</HI> i&s;&s;ued a fifth Summons for the Parties to attend us on the Sixteenth of the &s;ame Month, in order to the final Settlement of the Accounts, and making our Report thereof: which Summons being duly &s;erved, the Council for the Complainants appeared, as did tho&s;e of the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> to whom the Accounts, &s;o far as then Drawn out in form, were then &s;hown, &amp; they de&s;iring a Copy of the &s;ame, we an&s;wered, that giving Copies of a part would cau&s;e an unnece&s;&s;ary Delay, but as &s;oon as the Accounts &s;hould be fini&s;hed, they &s;hould have a Copy (if de&s;ired) of the Accounts, and of our Report together, to make their Objections to them.

<P>Afterwards, to wit, the 2<HI>d</HI> day of <HI>March,</HI> 1727-8. Capt. <HI>Matthew Norris,</HI> Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Low&s;taff,</HI> Pre&s;ented a Petition to this Court, &s;etting forth, <HI>That the Complainants in this Suit, &s;ued as Agents for the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>That he had Orders to &s;eize</HI> Spani&s;h Ships <HI>and</HI> Effects, <HI>as in time of War, that he had lately Seized</HI> 4OO <HI>Bags of Snuff, part of the &s;ame Cargo, and Libelled it in the Court of Admiralty, and after regular Proceedings there, that it no way appeared the Property was altered from the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>and therefore the &s;ame was Condemned;</HI> and therefore Prayed, <HI>That what might be Decreed in this Suit, might be to his Maje&s;ty's U&s;e.</HI> Whereupon it was Ordered, That Cau&s;e be &s;hown, on <HI>Fryday</HI> then next, Why the Prayer of the &s;aid Petition &s;hould not be granted? And now at this Day, to wit, the 8<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>March,</HI> 1727-8. upon Notice duely given, it was moved, That the Report of the Ma&s;ters afore&s;aid &s;hould be read, Which being accordingly read, it was moved, That the &s;ame be ab&s;olutely Confirmed, &amp; that this Court would Decree accordingly. Which Motion <HI>Jo&s;eph Murray</HI> and <HI>William Smith,</HI> Council for the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> appearing, did oppo&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their Exceptions to the Decree in the &s;aid Ma&s;ters Report. To which it was An&s;wered by the Complainants Council, That it was entirely irregular to Offer any thing to that purpo&s;e at
<PB N="41" REF="003019_0043_0FEFA1105A894DF0">
this time, in &s;o far as they have had time enough to file their Exceptions to the Ma&s;ters Report, according to the cour&s;e of the Court, if they conceived their Clyent wronged thereby; And that it was unprecedented to Offer any thing again&s;t a Report, without Exceptions thereto fir&s;t duely filed. How|ever this Court did order the Depo&s;itions and Proofs in this Cau&s;e to be brought, and &s;o much thereof as related to the Exceptions in the &s;aid Ma&s;ters Report, to be read; And the matter being debated by the Council of both &s;ides, this Court was of Opinion, <HI>That the &s;aid Report do &s;tand Confirmed, if no further matter appeared why the &s;ame &s;hould not.</HI> Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;eph Murray,</HI> of Council for Capt. <HI>Norris,</HI> moved and in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>James Alexander,</HI> Council for the Complainants, &s;hould be ordered by this Court as Advocate-General of of this Province, to &s;upport the &s;aid Petition of Capt. <HI>Norris.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>James Alexander</HI> Surrendered to his Excellency his Commi&s;&s;ion as Advocate General, and prayed his Surrender might be accepted of, and that he might not be &s;o Compelled. Which Surrender being accepted of, Cau&s;e was &s;howed why the &s;aid Petition &s;hould not be granted, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Fact therein alledged, That it appeared by the Bill and 2<HI>d An&s;wer,</HI> That this Suit was for Relief to <HI>Medina</HI> and Company, for the Snuff wanting, and to the bearers of their Orders, for the 1397<HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> and the 1500 <HI>Pounds</HI> Bond in their own Right, and not as Agents to any Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> As to his Orders, it appeared they were from the Admiralty, who had no Juri&s;diction or Power beyond High-Water Mark, &amp; therefore his Orders of no further extent; and that he could not by virtue thereof Enter into any hou&s;e here lawfully, to Execute his Orders, by &s;eizing upon any thing; and that it was notorious, that the Preliminary Articles of Pacfication were &s;igned on the part of <HI>England</HI> long ago, and that we have had &s;everal accounts that they are now &s;o on the part of <HI>Spain;</HI> for both which Rea&s;ons, tho' the mat|ter in que&s;tion had been the King of <HI>Spains,</HI> (which they expre&s;ly denyed) he ought not to intermedle him&s;elf in this Affair; and as no other Per&s;on here had any Orders or Power to &s;eize or affect the matter in que&s;tion, then nothing could lawfully affect it.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> As to the Property being in the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that the Admiralty could &s;ee nothing that had altered it; It was in&s;i&s;ted, That was no Rea&s;on why this Court, or any other Court, might not &s;ee Evidence to prove it was altered. And thereupon it was in&s;i&s;ted, That the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain's</HI> Or|ders to the <HI>India Company,</HI> to cau&s;e the Tobacco's to be delivered to <HI>Medina</HI> and Company, with their Orders accordingly, and the acceptance of them by the Defendant <HI>Hett,</HI> was by the Laws of Nature, of Nations, and of Merch|ants, a &s;ufficient ve&s;ting of the Property in Medina and Company, unle&s;s there was an expre&s;s Tru&s;t proved; which in this ca&s;e appeared not. Whereupon <HI>Jo&s;eph Murray,</HI> of Council for Capt. <HI>Norris,</HI> prayed further time to An&s;wer the Cau&s;es &s;howed again&s;t the &s;aid Petition.</P>
<P>And it appearing to this Court, that as to the 1500 <HI>l.</HI> Bond, and the 1397 <HI>l.</HI> 18<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> and Intere&s;t thereof, Relief could only be due to the Complainants <HI>Pacheco, De Lara,</HI> &amp; <HI>De Co&s;ta,</HI> for the &s;ame, not as Agents to any body, but in their own right.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="003019_0044_0FEFA1138E5FC388">Therefore this Court as to &s;o much, and the Co&s;ts, did Order the matters herein before Decreed and the &s;aid Report to &s;tand ab&s;olutely Confirm|ed and Decreed, to be Ob&s;erved and performed, and the Moneys found due by the &s;aid Report, to be paid to the Complainants with Intere&s;t by all Parties, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</P>
<P>And it is this pre&s;ent Day, to wit, the Eighth Day of <HI>March,</HI> in the fir&s;t year of the Reign of Our Sovereign Lord <HI>George</HI> the Second of <HI>Great Brittain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> King, Defender of the <HI>Faith</HI> &amp;c.

<P>And that as to the remainder <HI>viz.</HI> 82 <HI>l.</HI> 0 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> and the 20 Barrels of Snuff in the Cu&s;tody of <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> that the &s;ame Report and Decree do &s;tand al&s;o ab&s;olutely Confirmed and Decreed, unle&s;s &s;ufficient cau&s;e is &s;hown why the &s;ame &s;hould not by Monday next, on the part of Capt. <HI>Norris.</HI></P>
<P>And it was further moved; becau&s;e <HI>Cadwallader Colden</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was gone out of Town, that <HI>Robert Lurting,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> do make the Report of the Co&s;ts to this Court, with all Expedition. Which was Ordered accordingly.</P>
