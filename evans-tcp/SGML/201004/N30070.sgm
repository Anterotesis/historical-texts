<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE double Tye of Nature and Grace, be&s;ides the many endearing Pa&s;&s;ages that for &s;o many Year have linked &amp; glewed our Affections &s;o intimately, cannot but beget a tender Sympathy in me with you under all your Troubles; and make me &s;ay of every Affliction which befalls you, <HI>half mine.</HI> I find it is with our Affections, as with the Strings of Mu&s;ical In&s;truments exactly &s;et at the &s;ame heighth, if one be <HI>touched,</HI> the other <HI>trembles,</HI> though it be at &s;ome Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Affections</HI> are one, and &s;o in a great mea&s;ure have been our <HI>Afflictions</HI> al&s;o. You cannot forget that in the Years lately pa&s;t, the Almighty vi&s;ited my Tabernacle with the Rod,
<PB REF="039945_0003_10149606AD70D000">and in one Year cut off from it the Root and Branch, the tender Mother, and the only Son. What the Effects of the&s;e <HI>Strokes,</HI> or rather of my own unmortified <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> were, I have <HI>felt,</HI> and you and others have heard. Surely, <HI>I was a Bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the Yoak;</HI> Yea, I may &s;ay with them, <HI>Lam. 3.19, 20. Remembring mine Affliction and my Mi|&s;ery, the Wormwood and the Gall, my Soul hath them &s;till in Remembrance, and is humbled in me.</HI></P>
<P>I dare not &s;ay that ever I felt my Heart di&s;contentedly ri&s;ing and &s;welling again&s;t God: no, I could &s;till ju&s;tifie him, when I mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly &s;marted by his Hand: If he had plunged me into a Sea of Sorrow, yet I could &s;ay in all that Sea of Sorrow, there is not a drop of <HI>In|ju&s;tice:</HI> But it was the over-beating, and o|ver-acting of my fond and unmortified Affec|tions and Pa&s;&s;ions that made &s;o &s;ad Impre&s;&s;i|ons upon my Body; and ca&s;t me under tho&s;e Di&s;tempers which &s;oon imbittered all my re|maining Comforts to me.</P>
<P>It was my earne&s;t De&s;ire &s;o &s;oon as I had Strength and Opportunity for &s;o great a Jour|ney, to vi&s;it you; that &s;o (if the Lord had pleas'd) I might both refre&s;h, and be refre&s;hed by you, after all my &s;ad and di&s;con&s;olate Days. And you cannot imagine what Content and Plea&s;ure I projected in that Vi&s;it; but it prov|ed to us, as all other Comforts of the &s;ame
<PB REF="039945_0003_10149606AD70D000">kind ordinarily do, more in <HI>Expectation,</HI> than in <HI>Fruition:</HI> For how &s;oon after our joy|ful Meeting and Embraces, did the Lord over|ca&s;t and darken our Day, by &s;ending Death into your Tabernacle, <HI>to take away the De&s;ire of your Eyes with a Stroke!</HI> to crop off that &s;weet and only Bud from which we promi&s;ed our &s;elves &s;o much Comfort. But no more of that, I fear I am gone too far already. It is not my De&s;ign to exa&s;perate your Troubles, but to heal them; and for that Purpo&s;e have I &s;ent you the&s;e Papers, which I hope may be of U&s;e both to you and many others in your Conditi|on, &s;ince they are the After Fruits of my own Troubles; Things that I have commended not to you from another Hand, but which I have (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) proved and ta&s;ted in my own Trials.</P>
<P>But I will not hold you longer here. I have only a few Things to de&s;ire for and from you, and I have done.</P>
<P>The Things I de&s;ire, are</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That you will not be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ha&s;ty to get off the Yoak which God hath put upon your Neck. Remember when your Child was in the Womb, neither of your de&s;ired it &s;hould be de|livered thence, till God's appointed. Time was fully come, and now that you travail again with Sorrow for its Death, Oh, de&s;ire not to be delivered from your Sorrows one Moment before God's Time for your Deliverance be ful|ly
<PB REF="039945_0004_101496086C922BE8">come al&s;o. Let Patience have its perfect Work; that Comfort which comes in God's Way and Sea&s;on, will &s;tick by you, and do you good indeed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I de&s;ire, That though you and your <HI>Afflictions</HI> had a &s;ad <HI>Meeting,</HI> yet you and they may have a comfortable <HI>Parting.</HI> If they effect that upon your Hearts which God &s;ent them for, I doubt not but you will give them a fair Te&s;timony when they go off.</P>
<P>If they obtain God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon them in their <HI>Operation,</HI> &s;urely they will have your Ble&s;&s;ing too at their <HI>Valediction:</HI> And what you entertained with <HI>Fear,</HI> you will di&s;mi&s;s with <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI> How &s;weet is it to hear the af|flicted Soul &s;ay, when God is lo&s;ing his Hands, <HI>It's good for me that I have been Afflicted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I heartily wi&s;h that the&s;e &s;earch|ing Afflictions may make the mo&s;t &s;atisfying Di&s;coveries, that you may now &s;ee more of the Evil of Sin, the Vanity of the Creature, and the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, than ever you yet &s;aw. Afflictions are Searchers, and put the Soul up|on &s;earching and trying its way, <HI>Lam. 3.14.</HI> When our Sin finds us out by Affliction, hap|py are we, if by the Light of Affliction we find out Sin. Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man whom God cha&s;teneth, and teacheth out of his Law, <HI>P&s;. 94.12.</HI> There are un&s;een Cau&s;es many Times of our Troubles; you have an Advantage now to fi&s;t out the Seeds and Principles from which they &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB REF="039945_0004_101496086C922BE8">
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> I wi&s;h that all the Love and Delight you be&s;towed upon your little One, may now be placed to your greater Advantage upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that the Stream of your <HI>Affection</HI> to him, may be &s;o much the &s;trong|er, as there are now fewer Channels for it to be divided into. If God will not have any part of your Happine&s;s to lie in Children, then let it wholly lye in him&s;elf. If the Jealou&s;ie of the Lord hath removed that which drew away too much of your Heart from him, and hath &s;po|ken by his Rod, &s;aying, <HI>Stand a&s;ide, Child, thou art in my way, and fille&s;t more Room in thy Parents Hearts than belongs to thee.</HI> O then deliver up all to him, and &s;ay, Lord, take the whole Heart entirely and undivided|ly to thy &s;elf. Henceforth let there be no par|ting, &s;haring, or dividing of the Affection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> betwixt God and the Creature, let all the Streams meet and center in him only.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That you may be &s;trongthened with all might in the Inner-man to all Patience, that the Peace of God may keep your Hearts, and Minds. Labour to bring your Hearts to a meek Submi&s;&s;ion to the Rod of your Father. <HI>We had Fathers of the Fle&s;h who correct|ed us, and we gave them Reverence, &s;hall we not much more be in Subjection to the Father of Spirits and live?</HI> Is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> comely for Children to conte&s;t and &s;tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with their Father! or is it the way to be freed from
<PB REF="039945_0005_1014960B602DABC0">the Yoak from &s;truggling under it! O that your Hearts might be in a like frame with his that &s;aid, Lord, thou &s;halt <HI>beat</HI> and I will <HI>bear.</HI> It was a good Ob&s;ervation that one made, <HI>Anima &s;edendo &amp; quie&s;cendo fit &s;a|piens.</HI> The Soul grows wi&s;e by &s;itting &s;till <HI>&amp;</HI> quiet under the Rod. And the Apo&s;tle calls tho&s;e excellent Fruits which the Saints ga|ther from their &s;anctified Afflictions, <HI>The peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Heb. <HI>12.11.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> My Hearts De&s;ire and Prayer to God for you, is that you may die daily to all vi&s;ible Enjoyments, and by the&s;e frequent Con|ver&s;es with Death in your Family, you may be prepared for your own Change and Di&s;&s;olu|tion when it &s;hall come.</P>
<P>Oh Friends! How many Graves have you and I &s;een opened for our dear Relations? How oft hath Death come up into your Win|dows, and &s;ummoned the Delight of your Eyes! It is but a little while and we &s;hall go to them; we and they are di&s;tingui&s;hed but by &s;hort Intervals.</P>
<P><HI>Tran&s;ivere patres, &s;imul hinc tran&s;ibi|mus omnes.</HI></P>
<P>Our dear Parents are gone, our lovely and de&s;irable Children are gone, our Bo&s;om Rela|tions that were as our own Souls are gone:
<PB REF="039945_0005_1014960B602DABC0">And do not all the&s;e Warning-Knocks at our Doors acquaint us, that we mu&s;t prepare to follow &s;hortly after them.</P>
<P>O that by the&s;e things, our own Death might be both <HI>ea&s;ie</HI> and <HI>familiar</HI> to us! the oftner it vi&s;its us, the better we &s;hould be ac|quainted with it; and the more of our belov|ed Relations it removes before us, the le&s;s of either Snare or Intanglement remain for us when our Turn comes.</P>
<P>My dear Friends, my Fle&s;h and my Blood, I be&s;eech you for Religion Sake, for your own &s;ake, and for my &s;ake, who&s;e Com|fort is in great part, bound up in your Pro&s;pe|rity and Welfare, that you read frequently, ponder &s;eriou&s;ly, and apply believingly the&s;e Scripture-Con&s;olations and Directions, which in &s;ome ha&s;te, I have gathered for your U&s;e; And the God of all Con&s;olation be with you.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO be above the Stroak of Pa&s;&s;ions is a <HI>Condition</HI> equal to <HI>Angels:</HI> To be in a <HI>State</HI> of Sorrow, without the Sen&s;e of Sorrow, is a <HI>Di&s;po&s;i|tion</HI> beneath <HI>Bea&s;ts;</HI> but duly to reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">late our Sorrows, and bound our Pa&s;&s;ions under the Rod, is the Wi&s;dom, Duty, and Ex|cellency of a <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI> He that is without natural Affections, is de&s;ervedly ranked a|mong the wor&s;t of <HI>Heathens;</HI> and he that is able rightly to manage them, de&s;erves to be number'd with the be&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Tho' when we are <HI>Sanctified,</HI> we put on the <HI>Divine Nature;</HI> yet till we are <HI>Glorified,</HI> we put not off the Infirmities of our <HI>humane Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t we are within the reach of Trou|bles, we cannot be without the Danger, nor ought not to be without the Fear of
<PB N="2" REF="039945_0007_10149611A37B7B18">Sin; and it is as hard for us to e&s;cape Sin, be|ing in <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> as <HI>Becalming</HI> in <HI>Pro&s;perity.</HI></P>
<P>How apt we are to tran&s;gre&s;s the Bounds both of Rea&s;on and Religion under a &s;harp Affliction, appears, as in mo&s;t Mens Expe|rience, &s;o in this Woman's Example, to who&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Sorrow, Chri&s;t puts a Stop in the Text: <HI>He &s;aw her, and had Compa&s;|&s;ion on her, and &s;aid to her, Weep not.</HI></P>
<P>The Lamentations and Wailings of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother, moved the tender Com|pa&s;&s;ions of the Lord in beholding them, and &s;tirred up more Pity in his Heart for her, than could be in her Heart for her dear and only Son.</P>
<P>In the Words we are to con&s;ider, both the <HI>Condition</HI> of the Woman, and the <HI>Coun|&s;el</HI> of Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Condition</HI> of this Woman, which appears to be very Dolorous and Di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed; her Groans and Tears moved and melted the very Heart of Chri&s;t, to hear and behold them: <HI>When he &s;aw her, he had Compa&s;&s;ion on her.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;ad an Hour it was with her when Chri&s;t met her, appears by what is &s;o di|&s;tinctly remarked by the Evangeli&s;t, in <HI>ver.</HI> 12. where it is &s;aid, <HI>Now when they came nigh to the Gate of the City, behold there was a dead Man carried out, the only Son of his Mo|ther, and &s;he was a Widow, and much Peo|ple of the City was with her.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039945_0007_10149611A37B7B18">
In this one Ver&s;e, divers Heart-piercing Circum&s;tances of this Affliction are noted.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It was the <HI>Death of a Son.</HI> To bury a Child, any Child mu&s;t needs rend the Heart of a tender Parent; for what are Children but the Parent multiplied? A Child is a part of the Parent made up in another Skin. But to lay a Son in the Grave, a Son which continues the Name, and &s;upports the Fa|mily; this was ever accounted a very great Affliction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This Son was not carried from the <HI>Cradle</HI> to the <HI>Coffin,</HI> nor &s;tript out of its <HI>Swathing,</HI> to be wrapt in it's <HI>Winding-Cloth:</HI> Had he died in Infancy, before he had engaged <HI>Affection,</HI> or rai&s;ed <HI>Expectati|on,</HI> the Affliction had not been &s;o punge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and cutting, as now it was; Death &s;mote this Son in the Flower and Prime of his Time.

<P>Thus <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> bewailed the Death of his Son:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I once had a Son who was a young Man, my only Succe&s;&s;or, the Solace of my Age, the Glory of his Kind, the Prop of my Family, arrived to the endear|ing Age; then was he &s;natcht from me by Death, who&s;e lovely Voice, but a little be|fore I heard, who late|ly was a plea&s;ant &s;pe|ctacle to his Parent.</NOTE> <Q>Filius mihi erat adole&s;cens, &s;olus vitae &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;o|latium &s;enectae, gloria generis, flos aequaliam, fulcrum domus, aetatem gratio&s;i&s;&s;imam a|gebat: hic raptus periit, qui paulo ante jucundam vo|cem edebat, &amp; ju|cundi&s;&s;imum &s;pe|ctaculum parentis oculis erat.</Q></P>
<P>Reader, if this have been thine own Condition, as it hath been his that writes it, I need &s;ay no more to convince thee, that it was a &s;orrowful State indeed Chri&s;t met this tender Mother in.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> And which is yet more, he was not only a Son, but an only Son: So you find in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 12. <HI>He was the only Son of his Mother,</HI> One in whom all her Hopes and Comforts of that kind were bound up.

<P>Many a Man's Soul is to his Body, as a &s;harp Knife to a thin &s;heath, which ea&s;ily cuts it through; and what do we by poring and pondering upon our Troubles, but whet the Knife that it may cut the deeper and the quicker?

And O that my Words may be as &s;ucce&s;s|ful upon tho&s;e pen&s;ive Souls that &s;hall read them, as <HI>Abigal</HI>'s were to <HI>David,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25.32. who when he perceived how proper and &s;ea&s;onable they were, &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, who &s;ent thee this Day to meet me, and ble&s;&s;ed be thy Advice.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible how hard a Task it is, I here undertake; to charm down, and allay mutinous, raging, and tumultuous Pa&s;&s;ions; to give a Check to the Torrent of Pa&s;&s;ion, is ordinarily but to provoke it, and make it rage and &s;well the more.</P>
<P>The Work is the Lord's, wholly depends upon his Power &amp; Ble&s;&s;ing. He that &s;aith to the Sea, when the Waves thereof roar, Be &s;till; can al&s;o quiet and compo&s;e the &s;tormy and tumultuous Sea that rages in the Brea&s;ts of the Afflicted, and ca&s;ts up no|thing but the <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th</HI> of vain and u&s;ele&s;s Com|plaint of our Mi&s;ery, or the <HI>Dirt</HI> of &s;inful and wicked Complaints of the Dealings of the Lord with us.</P>
<P>The Rod of Affliction goes round, and vi&s;its all &s;orts of Per&s;ons without Difference It is upon the Tabernacles of the Ju&s;t an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>The Godly are not &s;o to be minded, as that the other be wholly neglected, they have as &s;trong and tender, though not as regular Affections to their Relations, and mu&s;t not be wholly &s;uffered to &s;ink under their unrelieved Burthens.</P>
<P>Here therefore I mu&s;t have Re&s;pect to two &s;orts of Per&s;ons, whom I find in Tears upon the &s;ame Account; I mean the Lo&s;s of their dear Relations, the Regenerate, and the Unregenerate.

We mu&s;t pity them that can|not pity them&s;elves. The Law of God Commands us to help a Bea&s;t, if fallen under its Burden; How much more a Man &s;ink|ing under a Load of Sorrows?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, U&s;es of Comfort to the Unre|generate are not, ordinarily, in U&s;e among us, and it may &s;eem &s;trange whence any Thing of Support &s;hould be drawn for them that have no &s;pecial Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, or Promi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="039945_0026_10149641425C85D0">
I confe&s;s al&s;o, that I find my &s;elf under great Di&s;advantages for this Work, I can|not offer them tho&s;e reviving Cordials that are contained in Chri&s;t, and the Covenant, for God's afflicted People; but &s;uch is the Goodne&s;s of God, even to his Enemies, that they are not left wholly without Sup|ports, or Means to allay their Sorrow.</P>
<P>If this therefore be thy Ca&s;e, who reade&s;t the&s;e Lines; afflicted and un&s;anctified, mourning bitterly for thy dead Friends, ha&s;t more cau&s;e to mourn for thy dead Soul, Chri&s;tle&s;s and Gracele&s;s, as well as Childle&s;s or Friendle&s;s: No comfort in hand, nor yet in Hope, full of Trouble, and no vent by Prayer or Faith to ea&s;e thy Heart.</P>
<P>Poor Creature, thy Ca&s;e is &s;ad, but yet do not wholly &s;ink, and &s;uffer thy &s;elf to be &s;wallowed up of Grief; thou ha&s;t laid thy dear one in the Grave, yet throw not thy &s;elf headlong into the Grave, after him; that will not be the way to remedy thy Mi&s;ery: But &s;it down a while and ponder the&s;e three things.</P>

If a Believer dies, there's no Danger of Hell to him, the Second Death hath no Power over him; but wo to thee if it overtake thee in thy Sin; beware therefore what thou do&s;t do again&s;t thy Health and Life. Do not put the Candle of Sorrow too near that Thread, by which thou hange&s;t over the Mouth of Hell.</P>
<P>O it is far better for to be Childle&s;s or Friendle&s;s on Earth, than hopele&s;s, and remedile&s;s in Hell.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Own and admire the Bounty and Goodne&s;s of God manife&s;ted to thee in this Affliction; that when Death came into thy Family to &s;mite and carry off one, it had not fallen to thy Lot to be the Per|&s;on; thy Husband, Wife or Child is taken, and thou art left; Had thy Name been in the Commi&s;&s;ion, thou had&s;t been now pa&s;t Hope.</P>
<P>O the &s;paring Mercy of God! the won|derful Long Suffering of God towards thee; Po&s;&s;ibly that poor Creature that is gone; never provoked God as thou ha&s;t done; thy poor Child never abu&s;ed Mer|cies, neglected Calls, trea&s;ured up the thou&s;andth part of that Guilt thou ha&s;t done So that thou mighte&s;t well imagine if &s;hould rather have cut thee down, that

<P>But oh the admirable Patience of God! Oh the Riches of his Long-&s;uffering! thou art only warned, not &s;mitten by it: Is there nothing in this worth thankful Ac|knowledgement? Is it not better to be in Black for another on Earth, than in the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s forever? Is it not ea&s;i|er to go to the Grave with thy dead Friend, and weep there; then to go to Hell among the Damned where there is Weeping, and Wailing, and Gna&s;hing of Teeth?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Affliction for which thou mourne&s;t, may be the greate&s;t Mercy to thee that ever yet befel thee in this World. God hath now made thy Heart &s;oft by Trouble, &s;hewed thee the Vanity of this World; and what a poor Trifle it is which thou made&s;t thy Happine&s;s: There is now a dark Cloud &s;pread over all thy worldly Comforts. Now, O now! if the Lord would but &s;trike in with this Affliction, and by it open thine Eyes to &s;ee thy de|plorable State, and take off thy heart for ever from the vain World which thou now &s;ee&s;t hath nothing in it; and cau&s;e thee to chu&s;e Chri&s;t the only abiding Good, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thy Portion.

O happy Death, that &s;hall prove Life to thy Soul.</P>
<P>Why this is &s;ometimes the way of the Lord with Men, <HI>Job</HI> 36.8, 9. <HI>If they be bound in fetters, and holden in Cords of Af|fliction then he &s;heweth them their work, and their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that they have exceeded: He openeth al&s;o their Ears to Di&s;cipline, and commandeth them that they return from I|niquity.</HI></P>
<P>O con&s;ider, poor pen&s;ive Creature, that which &s;tole away the Heart from God, is now gone: That which eat up thy Time and Thoughts, that there was no Room for God, Soul, or Eternity in them, is gone: All the vain Expectations that thou rai&s;ed&s;t up unto thy &s;elf, from that poor Creature which now lies in the Du&s;t, are in one Day quite peri&s;hed. O what an Advantage ha&s;t thou now for Heaven, be|yond whatever thou yet had&s;t If God will but ble&s;s this Rod, thou wilt have Cau&s;e to keep many a Thank&s;giving-Day for this Day.</P>

<P>The &s;pecial Limit is that Proportion of Time, which God by his own Coun&s;el and Will hath allotted to every individual Per|&s;on; and it is only known to us by the Event: This we affirm to be a fixed and unmoveable Term, with it all Things &s;hall fall in, and ob&s;erve the Will of God in our Di&s;&s;olution at that Time.

<P>And let none &s;ay the Death of Children is a praemature Death. God hath Ways to ripen them for Heaven, whom he in|tends to gather thither betimes, the which we know not: In Re&s;pect of Fitne&s;s they die in a full Age, though they be cut off in the Bud of their Time.</P>

<P>Yet let the Covenant God hath made with thee, comfort thee in this thy de&s;olate Condition.</P>
<P>You know what dome&s;tick Troubles holy <HI>David</HI> met with in a &s;ad Succe&s;&s;ion, not only from the Death of Children; but which was much wor&s;e, from the wicked Lives of his Children.

<P>And as it comforted him, although his Hou&s;e did not encrea&s;e, and tho&s;e that were left were not &s;uch as he de&s;ired: So it may abundantly comfort you al&s;o whatever Troubles or Deaths be upon your Families, who have an Intere&s;t in the Covenant. For,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If you be God's Covenant People, though he may <HI>afflict,</HI> yet he will never <HI>forget</HI> you, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 3.5. He is ever mindful <HI>of his Covenant.</HI> You are as much upon his Heart in your deepe&s;t Afflictions, as in the greate&s;t Flouri&s;h of your Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>You find it hard to forget your Child, though it be now turned to an heap of Cor|ruption, and loath&s;ome Rottenne&s;s; O how doth your Mind run upon it Night and Day! Your Thoughts tire not upon that Object: Why, &s;urely it's much more ea&s;ie for you to forget your dear Child whil&s;t living and mo&s;t endearing, much more when dead and unde&s;ireable; than it is for your God to forget you, I&s;a 49.15. <HI>Can a Wo|man forget her &s;ucking Child, that &s;he &s;hould not have Compa&s;&s;ion upon the Son of her

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As he will never forget you in your Troubles; &s;o he will order all your Troubles for your good; It is a <HI>well ordered Covenant,</HI> or a Covenant orderly di&s;po&s;ed: So that every thing &s;hall work together for your good.</P>
<P>The Covenant &s;o orders all your Trials, ranks and di&s;po&s;es your various Troubles &s;o, as that they &s;hall in their Orders and Places &s;weetly co-operate and join their united Influence to make you happy.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Covenant is not only well ordered in all things, but <HI>&s;ure;</HI> the Mercies contained in it are called <HI>the &s;ure Mercies of David,</HI> I&s;a. 55.3.

<P>Probably &s;uch Thoughts you have had, and rai&s;ed up to your &s;elves great Expecta|tions of Comfort in your old Age from it; but now you &s;ee you built upon the Sand; and where were you now, if you had not a firmer Bottom to build upon? But ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Covenant-Mercies are more &s;ure and &s;olid: God, Chri&s;t and Heaven, never &s;tart or fade as the&s;e things do.</P>
<P>The &s;weete&s;t Creature enjoyments you ever had or have in this World, cannot &s;ay

<P>But though the&s;e vani&s;h away, ble&s;&s;ed be God there is &s;omething that abides. <HI>Though all Fle&s;h be as Gra&s;s, and the Goodli|ne&s;s of it as the Flower of the Gra&s;s, though the Gra&s;s withereth, and the Flower thereof fadeth, becau&s;e the Spirit of the Lord blow|eth upon it; yet the Word of our God &s;hall &s;tand for ever,</HI> I&s;a. 40.6, 7, 8. There is &s;o much of Support contained in this one Con&s;ideration, that could but your Faith fix here, to realize and apply it, I might lay down my Pen at this Period, and &s;ay, the Work is done, there needs no more.</P>
<P N="9">9. Con&s;id. <HI>The Hope of the Re&s;urrection &s;hould powerfully re&s;train all Exce&s;&s;es of Sorrow in tho&s;e that do pro&s;e&s;s it.</HI></P>

<P>Q. D. Look not upon the Dead as a lo&s;t Generation: Think not that Death hath annihilated and utterly de&s;troyed them.

<PB N="75" REF="039945_0043_1014966ADB05E090">of them, which his plea&s;ant Contemplations of their vertuous Actions could give him; for he was wholly unacquainted with the comfortable and Heart &s;upporting Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection.

<P>I be&s;eech thee, Reader, if thy decea&s;ed Friend have left thee any &s;olid Ground of Hope that he died intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t, and the Covenant; that thou wilt di&s;tinctly ponder the&s;e admirable Supports which the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection affords:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the &s;ame Body which was &s;o plea&s;ant a Spectacle to thee, &s;hall be re|&s;tored again; yea, the &s;ame <HI>numerically,</HI> as well as the &s;ame <HI>&s;pecifically:</HI> So that it &s;hall not only be <HI>what</HI> it was, but the <HI>who</HI> it was. <HI>The&s;e Eyes &s;hall behold him, and not another,</HI> Job 19.27, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="76" REF="039945_0044_1014966D79F7E7A0">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> And farther, this is &s;upport|ing, that as you &s;hall &s;ee the &s;ame Per&s;on that was &s;o dear to you; &s;o you &s;hall know them to be the &s;ame that were once en|deared to you on Earth in &s;o near a tye of Relation.</P>
<P>Indeed you &s;hall know them no more in any carnal Relation, Death di&s;&s;olved that Bond: But you &s;hall know them to be &s;uch as once were your dear <HI>Relations</HI> in this <HI>World,</HI> and be able to &s;ingle them out among that great Multitude, and &s;ay, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was my Father, Mother, Husband, Wife or Child.

<P>For we may allow in that State, all that <HI>Knowledge</HI> which is <HI>cumulative</HI> and <HI>perfec|tive,</HI> what&s;oever may enlarge and heighten our Felicity and Satisfaction, as this mu&s;t needs be allowed to do. <HI>Luther</HI>'s Judg|ment in this Point being asked by his Friends at Supper the Evening before he died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melchior <HI>Adam</HI> in vita <HI>Lu|theri.</HI></NOTE> replied thus, <HI>What</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>befel</HI> Adam?

After the &s;ame Manner we al&s;o &s;hall be in the other Life renewed by Chri&s;t, and &s;hall know our Parents, our Wives and Chil|dren.</P>
<P>And this among other Things was that with which <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> comforted the Lady <HI>Italica</HI> after the Death of her dear Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ang.</HI> E|pi&s;t. 6.</NOTE> telling her that &s;he &s;hould know him in the World to come among the glorified Saints.

<P N="10">10 Con&s;id. <HI>The pre&s;ent Felicity into which all that die in Chri&s;t are pre&s;ently admitted, &s;hould abundantly comfort Chri&s;tians over the Death of &s;uch as either carried a lively Hope out of the World with them, or have left good Grounds of &s;uch an Hope behind them.</HI></P>
<P>Such there are that carried a lively hope to Heaven with them, who could evidence to them&s;elves and Friends their Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and in the Covenant.

<P>Parents, now ponder the&s;e Grounds; you have prayed for them, you have ma|ny Times wre&s;tled with the Lord on their Behalf; you have taken hold of God's Co|venant for them, as well as for your &s;elves and dedicated them to the Lord; and they have not by any Actions of theirs

<P>There is no Chri&s;tian Parent in the World but would rejoyce to &s;ee his Child out-&s;trip and get before him in Grace, that he may be more eminent in Parts and Ser|vice than ever he was: And that Rea&s;on can be given why we &s;hould not as much rejoyce to &s;ee our Children get before us in Glory as in Grace? They are gotten to Heaven a few Years before you, and is that Matter of Mourning? Would not your Child (if he were not ignorant of you) &s;ay as Chri&s;t did to his Friends a little before his Death, when he &s;aw them ca&s;t down at the Thoughts of parting, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.28. <HI>If ye loved me ye would rejoice, be|cau&s;e I go unto the Father, q. d.</HI> Do you value your own &s;en&s;ible Comfort from my Bodily Pre&s;ence with you, before my Glo|ry and Advancement in Heaven?

<P>Alas, though you want your Friend's Company, he wants not yours: Your Care was to provide for this Child, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath provided infinitely better for it than you could; you intended an E&s;tate, but he a Kingdom for it: You thought upon &s;uch or &s;uch a Match, but Chri&s;t hath forbid all others, &amp; married your Child to him&s;elf.

<P><Q>Another notable In&s;tance of Grace, with a very Remarkable Pa&s;&s;age in his Condition, I &s;hall here mention.

His Life was very remarkable for Tenderne&s;s, and near Conver&s;e with God in his walk; and which was worthy to be noticed, one day after a &s;harp Tryal, having his only Son &s;uddenly taken away by Death, he reti|red alone for &s;everal Hours, and when he came forth did look &s;o chearfully, that to tho&s;e who asked him the Rea&s;on thereof,

<P>That cowardly Spirit falleth upon the People of God when they are down and low in Spirit, as well as State.

<P>You now &s;it pen&s;ive under the Rod, &s;adly lamenting and deploring the Lo&s;s of &s;ome earthly Comfort, your Heart is &s;ur|charged with Sorrow, your Eyes run down upon every Mention and Remembrance of your dear Friend.

<P>Now you &s;ee that your Affections were &s;unk many Degrees deeper into the Crea|ture than you are aware of: and what &s;hould God do in this Ca&s;e by you?

<P>Yea, What if by this Stroke upon one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Things you had in this World, God will di&s;cover to you, more &s;en&s;ibly and effectually than ever, the Va|nity both of that and all other earthly Comforts, &s;o as that you &s;hall from hence|forth never let forth your Heart, your Hope, your Love and Delight to any of them, as you did before? You could talk before of the Creature's Vanity; but I que&s;tion whether ever you had &s;o clear &amp; convincing a Sight of its Vanity as you have this Day. And is not this a con&s;ide|rable Mercy in your Eyes?</P>

<P>The next Day, the Two Boys having crept a&s;ide, found the Hide of a Bea&s;t which had been killed, at the Root of a Tree; which the Mother ca&s;t over them lying upon the Snow.

<P>Thus they lived Ten Days without a|ny vi&s;ible Means of Help, having no Bread but Ice and Snow, nor Drink ex|cept Water.

<P>Indeed, had your Neglect or Mi&s;carri|age been knowing or voluntary, or had you really preferred a little Money (being able to give it) before the Life of your Rela|tion, and did deliberately chu&s;e to hazard this, rather than part with that, no doubt then but there had been much Evil of Sin mixed with your Affliction: And your Con|&s;cience

<P N="1">1. <HI>An&s;.</HI> Though you want at pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible Comfort, yet you have Rea&s;on to be thankful for gracious Sup|ports, Though the Light of God's Countenance &s;hine not upon you; yet you find that the everla&s;ting Arms are underneath you; the Care of God worketh for you, when the Con&s;olations of God are withdrawn from you.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>An&s;.</HI> To have God hide his Face in the time of Trouble is no new, nor unu&s;ual Thing. God's deare&s;t Saints, yea, his own Son hath experienced it; who in the deeps of inward and outward Trouble, when Wave called unto Wave, felt not tho&s;e &s;weets &s;en&s;ible influences of Com|fort from God, which had always filled his Soul formerly. If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> cry in Extremity, <HI>My God, wy God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Then &s;ure we need not wonder, as if &s;ome &s;trange Thing had happpened to us.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>An&s;.</HI> May not your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Carrage under the Rod provoke God for to hide his Face from you? Pray con&s;ider it well, nothing is more probable than this, for to be the Cau&s;e of God's Withdrawment from you Could you in Meekne&s;s and Quietne&s;s receive that Cup your Father hath given you to drink; accept the Puni&s;hment of your Iniquities; &s;ay, that Good is the Word of the Lord, it is the Lord, let him do what he will; you would &s;oon find the Ca&s;e altered with you; but the com|forting Spirit finds no delight or Re&s;t in a turbulent and tumultuous Brea&s;t.</P>

And thus I have &s;atisfied the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Pleas urged in Ju&s;tification of our Exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. I come now to the la&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, namely, The Means of curing and preventing the&s;e &s;inful Exce&s;&s;es of Sorrow for the Death of dear Relations.</P>
<P>And although much hath been &s;aid already to di&s;&s;uade from this Evil, and I have enlarged already beyond my fir&s;t Intention; yet I &s;hall ca&s;t in &s;ome farther Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the Healing of this De&s;temper, by pre&s;cribing the following Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. Rule. <HI>If you would not mourn exce&s;&s;ively for the Lo&s;s of Creature-Comforts, then beware that you &s;et not your De|light and Love exce&s;&s;ively or inordinatly upon them whil&s;t you do enjoy them</HI></P>
<P>Strong <HI>Affections</HI> make &s;trong <HI>Afflictions,</HI> the higher the Tide, the lower the Ebb. According to the Mea&s;ure of our Delight in the Enjoyment, is our Grief in the Lo&s;s of the&s;e Things. The Apo&s;tles knits the&s;e two Graces, <HI>Temperance</HI> &amp; <HI>Patience</HI> together in the Precept, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.16. And it's very ob&s;ervable, how <HI>Intemperance</HI> and <HI>Impatience</HI> are in|&s;eparably linked in Experience, yea, the Experience of the be&s;t Men, You read, <HI>Gen.</HI> 37.3. How <HI>I&s;rael loved Jo&s;eph more than all his Children, becau&s;e he was the on of his old Age; and made him a Coat of many Colours.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Darling; <HI>Jacob's</HI> Heart was exceedingly &s;et upon him; his very Life was bound up in the Life of the Lad, Now when the &s;uppo&s;ed Death of this Child was brought to him, how did he carry it See <HI>Ver.</HI> 34.35. <HI>And Jacob rent his Cloaths, and put Sackloth upon his Loins, and mourned for his Son many Days: And all his Sons &amp; all his Daughters ro&s;e up to comfort him, but he refu&s;ed to he Comforted; and he &s;aid, For I will go down to the Grave to my Son mourning. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Father wept for him.</HI></P>
<P>Here, as in a Gla&s;s, are the Effect of exce&s;&s;ive Love to a Child repre&s;ented. Here you may &s;ee what Work immoderate Love will make, even in a &s;anctified Heart.</P>
<P>O therefore <HI>let your Moderation be known to all Men,</HI> in your Delights and Sorrows about earthly Things; for ordinarily the Proportion of the one is an&s;werable to the other.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="131" REF="039945_0071_101496AA487B8240">
2. Rule. <HI>If you would not be overwhelmed with Grief for the Lo&s;s of your Relations, be exact and careful in di&s;charg|ing your Duties to them while you have them</HI></P>
<P>The Te&s;timony of your Con&s;cience that you have la|boured in all Things to di&s;charge the Duties you owed to your Relations, whil&s;t they were with you, will prove an excellent Allay to your Sorrows for them when they are no longer yours. 'Tis not &s;o much the &s;ingle Affliction as the Guilt charged upon us in Times of Affliction, that makes our Load &s;o heavy.</P>
<P>O what a terrible Thing is it to look upon our dead Friend, whil&s;t Con&s;cience is accu&s;ing and upbraiding us for our Duties neglected, and &s;uch or &s;uch Sins com|mitted? O you little think how dreadfula Spectacle this will make the dead Body of thy Friend to thee.</P>
<P>Con&s;cience if not quite &s;tupid, or dead, will &s;peak at &s;uch a Time. O therefore, as ever you would provide for a comfortable parting at Death, or meet again at Judg|ment; be exact, punctual and circum&s;pect in all your Re|lative Duties.</P>
<P N="3">3. Rule <HI>If you would not be overwhelmed by Trouble for the lo&s;s of dear Relations, then turn to God under your Trouble, and pour out your Sorrows by Prayer into his Bo&s;om.</HI></P>
<P>This will ea&s;e and allay your Troubles? Ble&s;&s;ed be God for the Ordinance of Prayer; How much are all the Saints beholden to it at all Times, but e&s;pecially in Heart-&s;inking &amp; di&s;tre&s;sful Times. It's &s;ome Relief, when in our Di&s;tre&s;s we can pour out our Trouble into the Bo&s;om of a Wife, or faithful Friend; how much more when we leave our Complaint before the gracious, wi&s;e, and faithful God? I told you before of that Holy Man, who having lo&s;t his dear and only Son, got to his Clo&s;et, there poured out his Soul freely to the Lord, and when he came down to his Friends that were waiting below to comfort him and fearing how he would bear that Stroke; he came from his Duty with a chearful Countenance, telling them he would be content to bury a Son, if it were po&s;&s;ible, every Day, provided he might enjoy &s;uch Comforts as his Soul had found in that private Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="039945_0072_101496ABFABA0EC0">
Go thy way, Chri&s;tian, to thy God, get thee to thy Knees in the cloudy &amp; dark Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Retire from all Crea|tures, that thou maye&s;t have thy full Liberty with God, &amp; there pour out thy Heart before him, in free, full &amp; broken-hearted Confe&s;&s;ions of Sin: Judge thy &s;elf worthy of Hell as well as of this Trouble: Ju&s;tify God in all his &s;marte&s;t Strokes; beg him in this Di&s;tre&s;s to put under thee everla&s;ting Arms, intreat one Smile, one gracious Look to inlighten thy Darkne&s;s &amp; chear thy drooping Spirit. Say with the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.17. <HI>Be not thou a Terror to me; thou art my Hope in the Day of Evil.</HI> And try what Relief &s;uch a Cour&s;e will afford thee.

<P N="4">4. Rule. <HI>If you would bear the Lo&s;s of your dear Rela|tions with Moderation, eye God, in the whole Proce&s;s of the Affliction, more, and &s;econdary Cau&s;es and Circum&s;tances of the Matter, le&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becau&s;e thou did&s;t it,</HI> P&s;. 39.9. Con&s;ider the Hand of the Lord in the whole Matter: And that,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As a Sovereign Hand which hath right to di&s;|po&s;e of thee, and all thy Comforts without thy Leave or Con&s;ent, <HI>Job</HI> 33.13.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As a Father's Hand correcting thee in Love &amp; Faithfulne&s;s, Prov. 3.11. <HI>Whom the Lord loveth, he cor|recteth, as a Father the Son in whom he delighteth.</HI> O if once you could but &s;ee Affliction as a Rod in a Father's Hand proceeding from his Love, and intended for your eternal Good; how quiet would you then be?</P>
<P>And &s;urely if it draw your Heart nearer to God, &amp; mortify it more to this vain World, it is a Rod in the Hand of &s;pecial Love: If it end in your Love to God, doubt not but it comes from God's Love to you.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As a ju&s;t and Righteous Hand, Ha&s;t not thou procured this to thy &s;elf by thy own Folly? Yea, the Lord is ju&s;t in all that is come upon thee: Whatever he hath done, yet he hath done thee no wrong</P>

<P N="5">5. Rule. <HI>If you would bear your Affliction with Mode|ration, compare it with the Affliction of other Men, and that will greatly quiet your Spirits</HI></P>
<P>You have no Cau&s;e to &s;ay, God hath dealt bitterly with you, &amp; that there is no Sorrow like unto your Sor|row: Look round about you, &amp; impartially con&s;ider the Condition that others are in: And they nothing inferi|or to you in any Re&s;pect. You had one dead Child, <HI>Aa|ron</HI> had two at a &s;troke, <HI>Job</HI> all one &s;troke, and both the&s;e by an immediate Stroke from the Hand of God. Some Godly Parents have lived to &s;ee their Children die in their Sin by the Hand of Ju&s;tice: Others have &s;een them live to the Di&s;honour of God, &amp; breaking of their own Spirits: And would have e&s;teemed it a Mer|cy if they had died from the Womb, and given up the Gho&s;t when they came out of the Belly, as <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks.</P>
<P>In what Mi&s;ery have &s;ome Parents &s;een their Chil|dren lie? God holding them as &s;o many terrible Specta|cles of Mi&s;ery before their Eyes; &s;o that they have begged the Lord with Importunity, to let loo&s;e his Hands and cut them off: Death being in their E&s;teem, nothing to tho&s;e continual Agonies, in which they have &s;een them lie &s;weltering from Day to Day. O you little know what a bitter Cup others have had given them to drink. Sure|ly if you compare, you mu&s;t &s;ay, the Lord hath dealt gently and graciou&s;ly with me.</P>
<P N="6">6. Rule. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">refully &s;hun and avoid what&s;over may re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your Sorrow, or provoke you to Impatience.</HI></P>
<P>Increa&s;e not your Sorrow by the Sight of, or Di&s;cour|&s;es about &s;ad Objects, and labour to avoid them, as Oc|ca&s;ions pre&s;ented by the Enemy of your Souls, to draw forth the Corruptions of your heart.</P>
<P>I told you before, why <HI>Jacob</HI> would not have the Child of which <HI>Rachel</HI> died, called after the Name his Wife had given, <HI>Benoni,</HI> the Son of my Sorrow, le&s;t it &s;hould
<PB N="134" REF="039945_0073_101496AEDB53E150">prove a daily Occa&s;ion of renewing his Trouble for the lo&s;s of his dear Wife; but he called his Name <HI>Benjamin.</HI></P>
<P>Your Patience is like Tinder, or Gun-Powder, &s;o long as you can prevent the Sparks from falling on it, there is no great Danger: But you that carry &s;uch dangerous prepared Matter in your own Hearts, cannot be too care|ful to prevent them. Do by murmuring as you do by bla&s;phemous Thoughts, think quite another way, and give no Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. Rule. <HI>In the Day of your mourning for the Death of your Friend, &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider your own Death as approach|ing, and that you &amp; your dead Friend are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;mall Interval and Point of Time.</HI> 2 Sam. 11.13. <HI>I &s;hall go to him.</HI> Surely the Thoughts of your own Death as approaching al&s;o, will greatly allay your Sorrows for the Dead that are gone before you. We are apt to fancy a long Life in the World, &amp; then the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e Comforts which we promi&s;ed our&s;elves &s;o much of the &s;weetne&s;s &amp; comfort of our Lives from, &s;eems an intolerable Thing.</P>
<P>But would you realize your own Deaths more, you would not be &s;o deeply concerned for their Death as you are. Could you but look into your own Graves more &s;eri|ou&s;ly, you would be able to look into your Friend's Grave more compo&s;edly.</P>
<P>And thus I have fini&s;hed what I de&s;igned from this Scripture. The Father of Mercies and God of all Com|forts, who&s;e &s;ole Prerogative it is to comfort them that are ca&s;t down, write all his Truths upon your Hearts, that they abide there, and reduce your di&s;ordered Affections to that Frame which be&s;t &s;uits the Will of God, &amp; the Profe&s;|&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u make of Subjection and Re&s;ignation thereunto</P>
