<P>A MILITIA is the mo&s;t natural defence of a free &s;tate, from inva|&s;ion and tyranny: they who compo&s;e the militia, are the proprie|tors

<P>THEY who follow the profe&s;&s;ion of arms conceive them&s;elves exempted from the u&s;eful occupations of life, and thence con|tract a habit of di&s;&s;ipation; &s;oldiers inured to exerci&s;e and labour in their duty, at lea&s;ure to roam, will not be wholly inactive in a city, where the means of gratification abound; per&s;uing the objects of plea&s;ure, with the &s;ame zeal they engaged in the toils and enterprizes of the field. Whole armies have, too late, found them|&s;elves de&s;troyed by the di&s;&s;olving power of luxury.</P>
<P>WE have a remarkable in&s;tance of this, my fellow-citizens, in the army of Hanibal, which, having with&s;tood the greate&s;t hard|&s;hips, and which the mo&s;t dreadful dangers had never been able

<P>THE effects of luxury tho' productive of the greate&s;t misfor|tunes to an army &s;tationed in a city, are by no means confined to that cla&s;s of men. The great body of the people, &s;mote by the charms and blandi&s;hments of a life of ca&s;e and plea&s;ures, fall ea&s;y victims to their fa&s;cinations. The city reared by the forming hand of indu&s;try, &s;oon feels the &s;ymptoms of di&s;&s;olution&mdash;The bu&s;y merchant now no more extends his commerce! The me|chanic throws a&s;ide his chi&s;&s;el; the voice of riot &s;ucceeds to the &s;ound of the hammer, and the midnight revel to the vigils of labour.</P>
<P>WHEN a large re&s;pectable &s;tanding army has been &s;tationed in a city, commanded by officers of known patrioti&s;m, who have taught tho&s;e under their orders, to enterchange the kind and friendly offices of life; citizens conceiving them&s;elves &s;ecured from dome&s;tic broils and the danger of inva&s;ion from abroad, imperceptibly relax in their attention to military exerci&s;es, and may thus be expo&s;ed as a tempting bait to an a&s;piring de&s;pot; be&s;ides, a people who have made them&s;elves re&s;pectable by their per&s;onal attention to their own defence, neglecting their militia, may be in&s;ulted by tho&s;e neigh|bours who had formerly been accu&s;tomed to revere their power.</P>

WHEN communities have &s;o far mi&s;taken their intere&s;t, as to commit the defence of every thing valuable in life to a &s;tanding army; the love of ca&s;e will &s;carcely permit them to rea&s;&s;ume the unplea&s;ing ta&s;k of defending them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of a long and bloody war, the liberties of a people are in real danger from the admi&s;&s;ion of troops into a free city. When an army has &s;uffered every hard&s;hip to which the life of a Soldier is peculiarly incident, and has returned crowned with the well earned laurels of the field, they ju&s;tly expect to be re|ceived into the open arms, and with the applau&s;es of tho&s;e for whom they have fought, and in who&s;e cau&s;e they have bled; in a &s;itua|tion like this, whole communities in tran&s;port of gratitude, have weakly &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of a deliverer, every thing for which their armies have fought or their heroes have bled.</P>
<P>NATIONS the mo&s;t renowned among the antients for their wi&s;dom and their policy, have viewed the army with an eye of attentive jealou&s;y; the Romans characterized for <HI>per&s;onal brave|ry,</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>In the battles fought in our age, every &s;ingle &s;oldier has very little &s;ecurity and confidence except in the multitude; but among the Romans, every indi|vidual, more robu&s;t and of greater experience in war, as well as more inured to the fatigues of it, than the enemy, relied upon him&s;elf only.

<BIBL>MONTESQUIEU</BIBL></Q></NOTE> trembled for their country, at the &s;ight of one hundred and fifty lictors or peace officers, as a guard of the decemviri&mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="018302_0010_0FA5CC1FE28B3B30">Such an army was dangerous, they &s;aid, to liberty. The&s;e poli|tic people knew the prevailing propen&s;ity in all mankind to power. The hi&s;tory of later times has abundantly ju&s;tified the wi&s;dom of their jealou&s;ies All parts of Europe which have been en&s;laved, have been en&s;laved by armies. No nation can be &s;aid to enjoy internal liberty which admits them in a time of peace. When a government has a body of &s;tanding troops at command, it is ea&s;y to form preten&s;ions for the di&s;tribution of them, &s;o as to effect their own purpo&s;es; when a favourite point is to be car|ried, a thou&s;and &s;oldiers may convey irre&s;i&s;table argument, and compel men to act again&s;t their feelings, intere&s;t and country.</P>
<P>SUCH were the arguments employed by Philip the &s;econd of Spain, to per&s;uade the inhabitants of the Netherlands to relin|qui&s;h their liberties, their property and their religion; the progre&s;s of the&s;e dreadful mea&s;ures produced &s;cenes of Ma&s;&s;acre and Deva&s;tation, the recital of which mu&s;t excite exqui&s;ite hor|ror in the mo&s;t &s;avage brea&s;t.</P>
<P>ONE of the commanders of the army under the duke of Alva, demanding a pa&s;s through the city of Rotterdam,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This whole affair is related at length in Wat&s;on's Hi&s;tory of the Low Countries to which the reader is referred.</NOTE> was at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, but a&s;&s;uring the magi&s;trates that be meant only to lead his troops through the town and not to lodge them in it; they con&s;ented to &s;uffer the companies to pa&s;s through one by one:
<PB N="12" REF="018302_0011_0FA5CC21681692C0">No &s;ooner had the fir&s;t company entered the city, than the officer, without regard to his engagements, ordered them to keep the gates open 'till the other companies &s;hould arrive; one of the citizens endeavouring to &s;hut the gate, was killed by his own hand; his troops eager to follow his example, drew their &s;words, and giving a loo&s;e to their fury, &s;pread them&s;elves over the town, and butchered more than three hundred of the inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>THIS was among the fir&s;t events of that war which rendered the Netherlands a &s;cene of horror and deva&s;tation for more than thirty years; but which, whil&s;t it proved the &s;ource on many occa&s;ions of extreme di&s;tre&s;s to the people, called forth an exer|tion of virtue, &s;pirit and intrepidity, which &s;eldom occurs in the annals of hi&s;tory. Never was there a more unequal conte&s;t than between the inhabitants of the Low-Countries, and the Spani&s;h Monarch; and never was the i&s;&s;ue of any di&s;pute more contrary to what the parties had rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>UNDER &s;imilar circum&s;tances, my fellow-citizens, a &s;tanding army was introduced and &s;tationed in this city; which produced the &s;cene we now commemorate; and which I know you cannot all remember; but let the &s;tranger hear and let the li&s;tening youth be told; that on the evening of the fifth of March, &s;even|teen hundred and &s;eventy, under the orders of a mercenary officer, murder with her polluted weapons, &s;tood trampling in

<P>IT has become fa&s;hionable in Europe, to keep a large &s;tanding army in times of peace. The people of Great-Britain have pro|fe&s;&s;ed their aver&s;ion to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, yet have &s;uffered it to gain ground upon the idea of pre&s;erving the balance of power.
<PB N="14" REF="018302_0013_0FA5CC22E12369E8">This cu&s;tom is &s;o deeply rooted and &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that nothing &s;hort of annihilation of the governments where they have been &s;o long tolerated can aboli&s;h the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ituation and vicinity of the nations of Europe with re&s;pect to each other, the different extent of territory rendering it more difficult to repel an inva&s;ion from &s;ome countries than others, for the celerity of defence and the more compleat &s;ecu|rity of exten&s;ive countries; from the&s;e and &s;imilar con&s;idera|tions, even wi&s;e politicians have defended the propriety of the e&s;tabli&s;hment; but let their motives be ever &s;o pure, the <HI>ambiti|ous</HI> and the <HI>a&s;piring</HI> have views more exten&s;ive and ruinous; they have felt the charms and experienced the utility of this engine, and are not wanting in their exertions to &s;upport its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>OUR fortunate Alliances in Europe have &s;ecured us from any danger of inva&s;ion from thence; this &s;ecurity is derived from con&s;iderations of the be&s;t policy and true intere&s;t of the allied powers.</P>

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>If there was ever among Nations a natural Alliance, one may be formed between the two republics. The fir&s;t planters of the four northern States found in this Country an A&s;ylum from Per&s;ecution, and re&s;ided here from the Year one thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred and eight, to the Year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty, twelve Years preceeding their Migration. They ever entertained and have tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, a grateful Remembrance of that Protection and Ho&s;pi|tality, and e&s;pecially of that religious Liberty they found here, having &s;ought it in vain in England.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t Inhabitants of two other States, New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, were immediate Emigrants from this Nation, and have tran&s;mitted their Religion, Language, Cu&s;toms, Manners and Character: and America in general, until her Connections with the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, has ever con&s;idered this Nation as her fir&s;t Friend in Europe, who&s;e Hi&s;tory, and the great Characters it exhibits, in the various Arts of Peace, as well as Atchievements of War by Sea and Land, have been particularly &s;tudied, admired and imitated in every State.</P>
<P>"A Similitude of Religion, although it is not deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential in this as in former Ages, to the Alliance of Nations, is &s;till, as it ever will be thought, a de&s;irable Circum&s;tance. Now it may be &s;aid with Truth, that there are no two Nations, who&s;e Wor&s;hip, Doctrine and Di&s;cipline, are more alike than the&s;e of the two Republicks. In this particular therefore, as far as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> weight, an al|liance would be perfectly natural.</P>
<P>"A Similarity in the Forms of Government, it u&s;ually con&s;idered as another Circum&s;tance, which renders Alliances natural: and although the Con&s;titutions of the two Republicks are not perfectly alike, there is yet Analogy enough between them, to make a Connection ea&s;y in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>"The Originals of the two Republicks are &s;o much alike, that the Hi&s;tory of one &s;eems but a Tran&s;cript from that of the other: &s;o that every Dutchman in|&s;tructed in the &s;ubject, mu&s;t pronounce the American Revolution ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, or pa&s;s a Cen&s;ure upon the greate&s;t Actions of his immortal Ance&s;tors: Actions which have been approved and applauded by Mankind, and ju&s;tified by the Deci&s;ion of Heaven.</P>
<P>"If therefore an Analogy of Religion, Government, Original, Manners, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and la&s;ting commercial Intere&s;ts, can form a Ground and an Invitation to political Connections, the Sub&s;criber flatters him&s;elf, that in all the&s;e Particulars the Union, is &s;o obviou&s;ly natural, that there has &s;eldom been a more di&s;tinct De&s;ignation of Providence to any two di&s;tant Nations to unite them|&s;elves together."</P>

<P>NEAR eight full years have now rolled away, &s;ince America has been ca&s;t off from the bo&s;om and embraces of her pretend|ed parent; and has &s;et up her own name among the empires. The a&s;&s;ertions of &s;o young a country, were at fir&s;t beheld, with dubious expectation; and the world were ready to &s;tamp the name of ra&s;hne&s;s or enterprize according to the event.</P>
<P>BUT a manly and fortunate beginning, &s;oon in&s;ured the mo&s;t generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The renowned and the ancient <HI>Gauls</HI> came early to the combat&mdash;wi&s;e in council&mdash;mighty in battle! Then with new fury raged the &s;torm of war! The &s;eas were
<PB N="18" REF="018302_0017_0FA5CC29A2B4B460">crim&s;oned with the riche&s;t blood of nations! America's cho&s;en legions waded to freedom through rivers died with the mingled blood of her enemies and her citizens; through fields of carnage; and the gates of death!</P>
<P>AT length, <HI>Independence</HI> is ours&mdash;the halcyon day appears, lo from the ea&s;t I &s;ee the harbinger, and from the train 'tis peace her&s;elf; and as attendants all the gentle arts of life; commerce di&s;plays her &s;now white navies, fraught with the wealth of king|doms; plenty from her copious horn, pours forth her riche&s;t gifts. Heaven commands! The ea&s;t and the we&s;t give up, and the north keeps not back! all nations meet! And beat their &s;words into plough&s;hares and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks, and re&s;olve to learn war no more.&mdash;Henceforth &s;hall the American wilder|ne&s;s blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e, and every man &s;hall &s;it under his vine and under his fig-tree, and none &s;hall make him afraid.</P>
