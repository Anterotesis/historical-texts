<P>TO form the minds of youth to the principles of u&s;eful knowledge, and to the e&s;teem and practice of virtue, is at once to communicate the greate&s;t benevolence to mankind, and to receive the mo&s;t rational &s;atisfaction of which a generous mind is capable.</P>
<P>At the au&s;picious Aera of the birth of an in&s;titution, founded here, to promote piety, virtue and literature, per|mit me to &s;olicit your attention to this plea&s;ing theme&mdash; A theme on which I cannot flatter my&s;elf, that I &s;hall offer any thing new, &s;ince it has received its de&s;erved Eulogies, from the enlightened of all ages, in which learning has flouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Were I to &s;peak of the importance of the good edu|cation of youth, in order to their pa&s;&s;ing through life with decency, reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s, and acting their part well on the theatre of the world; or in prai&s;e of the various branches of academic &s;cience; or of the &s;ucce&s;s which has attended the pious labors of tho&s;e who have laid the foundations of &s;uch in&s;titutions, in which the gentle hand of in&s;truction has led the &s;teps of expanding genius, in the path of virtue and of knowledge; or were I to &s;hew
<PB N="4" REF="018006_0003_0FA45464701A8B70">that the virtuous education of the ri&s;ing generation, lays the &s;ure foundation of that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation;</HI> my attempt would be anticipated by the celebrated ma&s;ters of in&s;truction, not only of <HI>Athens</HI> and of <HI>Rome,</HI> but of the&s;e more enlightned days.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubject has not novelty to recom|mend it, the occa&s;ion mu&s;t apologize for me, generous audi|tors, while I &s;hall attempt, for your entertainment, to offer a few thoughts on the advantage derived to mankind from the improvement of the under&s;tanding in knowledge, and the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</P>
<P>The divine architect, in the creation of the world, has pour'd abroad in rich profu&s;ion his benignity among the countle&s;s variety of beings, its inhabitants; each repre&s;enta|tive of his omnipotence, his knowledge, his wi&s;dom and his goodne&s;s. To <HI>man,</HI> the favorite of heaven, is given a pre|eminence; in that it hath plea&s;ed the &s;overeign goodne&s;s, to endue him with the powers of rea&s;on; uniting to the divine workman&s;hip of the body, an immortal &s;pirit, capa|ble of thought and reflection, and of everla&s;ting improve|ment in knowledge and virtue; and &s;o wi&s;ely con&s;tituting tho&s;e, that the animal powers and &s;en&s;es &s;hall be happily &s;ub&s;ervient to the rational improvement of the mind.</P>
<P>It is by the cultivation of this noble power, that man attains to &s;uperior dignity among his fellow men. by this he is brought to the knowledge of his end, and of the wi&s;|dom
<PB N="5" REF="018006_0004_0FA454652DE04B10">of that being, to whom, true &s;cience teaches him to refer, with uncea&s;ing gratitude, the tribute of &s;ublime prai&s;e. This is the glorious end of all &s;cience, and for which the father of &s;pirits confered the gift of rea&s;on on man.&mdash; The cultivation then, of our rational powers in knowledge and in virtue, is a duty as profitable as it is binding, and as plea&s;ing as it is profitable.</P>
<P>If we confine our pro&s;pect to tho&s;e great characters which have ro&s;e to eminence and glory on the &s;tage of life, we &s;hall find that they have attained that greatne&s;s by the im|provement of their minds in knowledge and virtue, and in the application of their attainments to the public good. I join the e&s;teem and practice of virtue with u&s;eful knowledge, becau&s;e there can be no true greatne&s;s without goodne&s;s; and deeds however illu&s;trious that originate not in &s;olid vir|tue, are but the &s;plendor of fal&s;e greatne&s;s; it is virtue that gives them con&s;i&s;tancy, dignity and merit.</P>
<P>From the dawn of life the mind gradually expands to receive the rays of truth, pre&s;ented by an endle&s;s variety of objects, which, if neglected by &s;alutary in&s;truction, con|tracts a &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and is ab&s;obed in ignorance; and by &s;uch neglect, deprived of receiving and communicating that rational happine&s;s of which it is capable.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the va&s;t importance of education, that the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of individuals, of families and of nations, depend upon it; wi&s;e legi&s;lators, heathen as well
<PB N="6" REF="018006_0005_0FA454660146C070">as chri&s;tian, have paid particular attention to it, and encourag|ed and &s;upported in&s;titutions of learning. They have &s;ought for, and maintained, in this honorable employment, men qualified to guide the youth to knowledge and virtue; hence colleges and &s;chools of learning have been founded and en|dowed in early days; and the encouragement and &s;upport of literature and of the arts and &s;ciences interwoven with their &s;y&s;tems of government and laws.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e with the wi&s;er heathen of <HI>Greece</HI> and of <HI>Rome;</HI> and in their public &s;chools were formed tho&s;e re|nowned &s;tate&s;men, patriots, orators, poets, philo&s;ophers and heroes; who by their abilities and generous labours, rai&s;ed their re&s;pective republics to eminence and glory in the hi&s;|tory of mankind. They ro&s;e to opulence and dominion, more by the aids of &s;uperior knowledge, than martial bra|very. By informing the minds of their youth with the knowledge of the rights of mankind, and warming them with patriotic virtue, they were animated to &s;uch active deeds as rendered them great in the e&s;timation of mankind, and reflected at the &s;ame time, the highe&s;t honor on the wi&s;dom of their government. Great and good men in all ages, have ever e&s;teemed it their honor and felicity to encourage and &s;upport in&s;titutions of learning.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking and propriety of rea&s;oning on &s;ub|jects within the ken of human comprehen&s;ion, with a &s;ui|table application of the principles of knowledge to the great purpo&s;es of living, are the happy fruits of a well regulated
<PB N="7" REF="018006_0006_0FA4546794F30980">education: and in this con&s;i&s;ts the dignity and glory of man.</P>
<P>By learning and virtue the civilized man is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;avage, and rai&s;ed as far above the uncultivated part of his &s;pecies, as they are above the animal. Learning enlarges the mind&mdash;frees it from its "native barrenne&s;s and ru&s;ticity"&mdash;collects and &s;trengthens the mental powers&mdash; reduces the pa&s;&s;ions to a proper &s;ubordination to the law of rea&s;on, and re&s;tores harmony to the &s;oul. It cheri&s;hes a manline&s;s of &s;pirit&mdash;it flouri&s;hes under the &s;hield of virtuous freedom&mdash;it is the enemy of &s;lavery&mdash;the &s;upport and orna|ment of every profe&s;&s;ion of the gown, the &s;word, the bar and the pulpit. It is the delight of our youthful days; an agreeable and profitable companion in active life; and the &s;olace of advanced age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cicero</NOTE></P>
<P>To a mind engaged in the &s;earch of truth, time imper|ceptibly pa&s;&s;es away&mdash;and is regaled with the repa&s;t of angels. On the wings of virtue and knowledge, it &s;oars towards perfection, and with the &s;teadine&s;s of the eagle, enjoys the beams of &s;cience, unclouded by prejudice or error.</P>
<P>Learning expands the heart with univer&s;al philanthropy&mdash;&s;timulates the &s;oul to a generous emulation&mdash;the good of mankind is the noble rule of its conduct &mdash;it is the light of human life. Happy the people who&s;e &s;ons pur&s;ue the paths of knowledge and of virtue! They will attain the purpo&s;es of life, by cultivating the arts of peace, manu|factures,
<PB N="8" REF="018006_0007_0FA454682B3FC318">agriculture and commerce; and by the practice of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which con&s;i&s;ts in ju&s;tice, mercy and truth, reach the &s;ummit of human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the contrary; ignorance degrades the &s;oul&mdash;the man is lo&s;t in the uncultivated &s;avage&mdash;and the "human form divine" but little &s;uperior to the irrational creation. By <HI>ignorance</HI> the mind is not only deprived of <HI>tho&s;e enlarged</HI> improvements in knowledge, and of that perfection of which it is made ca|pable, but it is the &s;lave of the &s;en&s;itive pa&s;&s;ions, and like a &s;hip without a pilot, overwhelmed and lo&s;t in the &s;torms of life.</P>
<Q><L>"<HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>vice,</HI></L>
<L>"In con&s;ort foul agree, each heigt'ning each,</L>
<L>"While <HI>virtue</HI> draws from <HI>knowledge,</HI> brighter fire."</L></Q>
<P>The &s;avage tribes of our we&s;tern wilderne&s;s, in their mode of life, exhibit a &s;triking contra&s;t to the advantages and felicity of a civilized people. De&s;titute of any regular forms of government, life and property are not &s;ecure; while no laws re&s;train the licentious, or protect the peaceable &s;ubject. They are the perpetual &s;laves of fierce and cruel pa&s;&s;ions and gloomy imaginations; the pa&s;&s;ive votaries of the <HI>prince of darkne&s;s,</HI> who rules uncontrouled in tho&s;e dark corners of the earth. But, what a happy change even among &s;avages, is made by the introduction of knowledge! Their barba|rous tempers are &s;oftened by the genial warmth of &s;cience; darkne&s;s no longer ob&s;tructs the mental ray. There, "witchcraft, magic and &s;orcery," and the an&s;wers of the
<PB N="9" REF="018006_0008_0FA4546A5CD370B8">oracles of demons di&s;appear&mdash; to the &s;hades of ignorance they fly&mdash;they flouri&s;h only in tho&s;e dark regions of the earth, where the light of &s;cience never &s;hines.</P>
<P>To ignorance, as the prolific cau&s;e, mu&s;t be attributed, the complication of mi&s;eries which tyranny and per&s;ecution have brought upon mankind in the different ages of the world.</P>
<P>Dete&s;table ignorance! thou, offspring of &s;in, and fruitful parent of evil! with foul a&s;&s;iduity thou nouri&s;he&s;t blind bigotry, gloomy &s;uper&s;tition, unre&s;i&s;ting &s;lavery, and bloody per&s;ecution! too long ha&s;t thou held mankind in thy chains. Thy charm &s;hall be broken. In thy ruin &s;hall &s;cience, liberty and virtue triumph!</P>
<P>The introduction of knowledge opens the minds of a people to comprehend the great purpo&s;es of living; and to pur&s;ue the means of attaining happine&s;s. It di&s;po&s;es them to &s;uppre&s;s lawle&s;s ambition and revenge; which, among the uncivilized, &s;peedily kindle the flames of war&mdash;for mankind, uncultivated, are prone to commence ho&s;tilities at every injury; having little to loo&s;e by the ravages of con|que&s;t. Far different is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e nations with whom manufactures, trade and commerce have made a progre&s;s: their intere&s;t and happine&s;s are &s;ecured by a peaceable conduct. Great indeed have been the changes which have been made among mankind by the introduction of the arts of civil and &s;ocial life, and the happy &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="10" REF="018006_0009_0FA4546BE5AA9018">evangelical truth&mdash;by the lighth of the&s;e the nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have emerged from gothic ignorance and barbari&s;m; and ro&s;e to greatne&s;s and refinement, both in a political and religious view. Hence, the va&s;t difference between the manners of the&s;e, and tho&s;e of the wandering herds of <HI>Tartars,</HI> the plundering tribes of <HI>Arabia</HI> and the &s;avage nations of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>By improving the human under&s;tanding, great di&s;coveries have been made, tending to the common utility and happi|ne&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>Inriched with the knowledge of the ancients, the moderns have excelled them in many valuable arts and manufactures. In profitable branches of &s;cience they have al&s;o excelled.&mdash; As the &s;uperior lu&s;tre of the &s;un eclip&s;es the rays of inferior orbs, &s;o &s;hines the genius of a <HI>Newton,</HI> among philo&s;ophers of former times. Admitted to pry into the <HI>arcana</HI> of go|vernment by which the heavenly bodies are regulated, with a force of penetration peculiar to him&s;elf, he has &s;truck out new paths for &s;ucceeding geniu&s;es, and reaching the zenith of human &s;cience, attained the glorious end, to which all knowledge is directed&mdash;to acknowledge and adore the allwi&s;e ruler of this &s;tupendious frame! In the contemplation of the univer&s;e the mind is enraptured, and anticipates the period which &s;hall di&s;ingage it from matter and open a field for everla&s;ting advancement towards perfection.</P>
<P>Great improvements have been made in later days in the
<PB N="11" REF="018006_0010_0FA4546D5E056CC0">&s;cience of geography. The le&s;&s;er divi&s;ions only of the earth were known to the ancients; their geographical knowledge was bounded by <HI>Britain</HI> and the <HI>Ganges;</HI> all be&s;ides was to them a <HI>Terra incognita.</HI></P>
<P>The polar property of the magnet, and its u&s;es in navi|gation, was to them unknown: hence their knowledge of di&s;tant regions and nations was very imperfect, and their ideas of them vi&s;ionary and romantic: and without this mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;covery, we mu&s;t have continued in the &s;ame igno|rance; and like the ancient <HI>Phoenicians</HI> performed our voyages only along the &s;hores, and by the guidance of the &s;tars. But by the aid of this invention, the &s;kilful mariner can now find his way thro' the pathle&s;s de&s;erts of the ocean in &s;torms and darkne&s;s, to the wi&s;hed-for port: by this, trade and commerce, the great &s;ources of national opulence and power, are carried on, the nations &s;pread over the face of the globe become acquainted, and are no longer &s;trangers or enemies, but friends, allies and brethren of one univer&s;al family. Commerce gives life and motion to the world; the &s;pirit of indu&s;try is hereby excited, the trea&s;ures and delica|cies of various climates di&s;tributed round the earth, and the general happine&s;s promoted. Far different from this, was the intercour&s;e of nations in the darker ages; <HI>then</HI> they fought each other to plunder or de&s;troy; and were known only as victors and vanqui&s;hed, tyrants and &s;laves.</P>
<P>Thus, from a few in&s;tances, we may di&s;cover the happi|ne&s;s derived to mankind from the improvement of the un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018006_0011_0FA4546D6D03C208">
Were we to trace the various and almo&s;t endle&s;s branches of the arts and manufactures to their &s;ource, each of them would afford a plea&s;ing topic of panegyric in favour of learn|ing; &s;ince they all owe their origin and perfection to the application of the principles of philo&s;ophy and the powers of mechanics: but our time will not indulge a further pur|&s;uit of the agreeable theme.</P>
<P>Come we now to &s;peak of the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</P>
<P>From the acknowledged advantages which are enjoyed by tho&s;e nations who cultivate the arts and &s;ciences, and train up their youth in u&s;eful knowledge, and the practice of moral virtue, the nece&s;&s;ity of education mu&s;t &s;trike every mind with conviction: and learning can have no enemies, the "ignorant excepted."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflections on learning.</NOTE> No man, re&s;pected auditors, can be truly great, who is not a friend to learning; &s;ince no man can be truly great without an enlightned under&s;tanding and a benevolent heart. The importance then of the propo&s;ition which I would attempt to illu&s;trate, mu&s;t, by the wi&s;e and good, be univer&s;ally acknowledged.</P>
<P>As the &s;kill of the Arti&s;t gives beauty and lu&s;tre to the rude diamond taken from the mine; &s;o does the poli&s;h of education di&s;cover <HI>the ju&s;t value of the</HI> rational immortal mind.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018006_0012_0FA4546E2D52DC08">
The de&s;ign of education is to qualify youth for an active, <HI>u&s;eful</HI> and <HI>virtuous life;</HI> and to direct them into the path of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>endle&s;s felicity.</HI> The&s;e are the great ends for which this in&s;titution is founded; which ordains, that the youth be initiated into &s;uch branches of human &s;cience, as &s;hall lay a foundation for their after improvement; and above all, that &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of moral obligation, and the great principles of natural and revealed religion, be made on their minds; as, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, may make them truly good; as well as u&s;eful in life.</P>
<P>Youth is a &s;u&s;ceptible age; free from prejudice, and ea|ger in the pur&s;uit of knowledge; in&s;truction obtains a wel|come admittance to their minds; the heart receives it by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition; and from thence it flows, in all the various actions of riper days.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which are made upon the mind in child|hood and youth are mo&s;t la&s;ting; as a new ve&s;&s;el long re|tains a tincture of the liquor which it fir&s;t receives: the&s;e form the manners, and regulate the temper thro' life; agreeable to the ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e&s;t of men. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>As education opens the mind to receive the light of revelation, it is hand-maid of religion; and the mer|ciful parent of the whole family of <HI>Adam,</HI> is plea&s;ed to cheri&s;h the &s;eeds of pious in&s;truction planted in the youthful
<PB N="14" REF="018006_0013_0FA4546FB46C2698">brea&s;t, with heavenly influence; and from tho&s;e families and in&s;titutions, in which religion is inforced by examples of goodne&s;s, and in&s;tructions of early peity, have tho&s;e per&s;ons u&s;ually been taken, whom GOD hath honored with di&s;tin|gui&s;hed u&s;efulne&s;s in the world.</P>
<P>As without application, knowledge is not to be acquired; and the mind gradually expands to receive it; the &s;kilful hand of in&s;truction is nece&s;&s;ary to rear it to valuable attain|ments. As the fertile &s;oil by proper cultivation &s;ends forth a rich harve&s;t, but if neglected by the hand of indu&s;try, yields nought but weeds and briers; &s;o the minds of youth, well in&s;tructed, will &s;end forth generous and &s;alutary fruit, to reward the labor.</P>
<P>In a public &s;chool, youth engaged in the &s;ame &s;tudies, will be excited by a laudable ambition to excel. The knowledge diffu&s;ed among the whole, will become in a degree the property of each individual. There the unhappine&s;s of &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions will be cured by a con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e that are plea&s;ant and amiable&mdash;they will poli&s;h one another. And, under the direction of the faithful precep|tor, the vicious pa&s;&s;ions will be checked as &s;oon as they appear; and the laudable, encouraged, protected and re|warded.</P>
<P>Our venerable ance&s;tors, impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of improving this early period of life, founded colleges and &s;chools; by which they have left us a monument of their
<PB N="15" REF="018006_0014_0FA45470838E9948">wi&s;dom, their piety and their patrioti&s;m, as la&s;ting as time. This good work of theirs, it hath plea&s;ed GOD remarkably to ble&s;s;&mdash;into tho&s;e fountains he has ca&s;t the &s;alt of divine grace; and the &s;alutary &s;treams have made glad the city of GOD. This generous part of that rightou&s;ne&s;s which con|&s;i&s;ts in a zealous pur&s;uit of duty towards the ri&s;ing genera|tion, we this day experience the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of, from the great father of mankind, who&s;e <HI>gentlene&s;s hath made us great.</HI></P>
<P>Let us bow the knee, my highly favoured auditors, to the GOD of our fathers and of our &s;alvation, with never cea&s;|ing gratitude, that it is our happy lot to draw the vital air, and flouri&s;h in this land of knowledge, of liberty and pub|lic virtue! That we are individual members of the&s;e States, which Heaven has crowned with the ble&s;&s;ings of INDE|PENDENCE and PEACE; and rendered pro&s;perous in population, commerce and wealth, and above all, that we enjoy the light of the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in great|er purity than any people on <HI>Earth!</HI> May it be the &s;ubject of our daily &s;olicitude&mdash;<HI>what &s;hall we render to the Lord for all his benefits!</HI></P>
<P>In this happy age, and even &s;ince the commencement of our &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle to be free, we behold a &s;pirit of enquiry on the great &s;ubject of the natural rights of mankind, ra|pidly &s;preading over the earth; and the eyes of de&s;potic princes and of their oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects opening to the con|viction of liberty and ju&s;tice; national prejudices di&s;appearing
