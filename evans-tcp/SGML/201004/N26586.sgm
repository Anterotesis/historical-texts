<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>The unfriendly reports that have been indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly circulated, by certain malevolent characters, re&s;pecting a &s;ettlement lately e&s;tabli&s;hed at the mouth of Cumberland on the Ohio river: and the late military abu&s;es, offered to my friends and &s;elf, on our late route down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, has induced me to &s;ubmit the following pages to the impartial circle of my fellow citizens: and to my friends in particular: As a ju&s;tice due them: and as a duty I owe my&s;elf, it becomes me now to declare mo&s;t &s;o|lemnly, that no part of my proceedings, negociati|ons, or corre&s;pondance, has ever been intended, or de&s;igned, directly or indirectly, to be immicalto my country: the con&s;titution or laws of it: to prove this my a&s;&s;ertion: &s;hould it be nece&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary: hundr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of citizens equally as re&s;pectable as any in the we&s;t|ern country will appear, who have been, and &s;till are, intimately acquainted with my intentions, and objects.</P>
<P>I further defy any man, or men on earth with truth to &s;ay that any part of my tran&s;actions, nego|ciations, or corre&s;pondance, ever was, or can po&s;&s;i|bly with propriety, be con&s;trued inimical to the true intere&s;t of my country; the con&s;titution or laws of it: but to the contrary, as much as any man on earth, I have ever re&s;pected &amp; reverenced them. If upon impartial inve&s;tigation I am wrong (it is not wilful) I wi&s;h to be convinced of it: if in the right, a legal remedy, &s;o as to prevent a future evil of the &s;ame nature: is all I a&s;k: I am content to bear my lo&s;&s;es with fortitude: it is beyond human reach to repair the injury.</P>

<P>All We&s;tern America, in the United States, South of latitude 41 degrees North&mdash;would in pro|portion, receive &s;imilar advantages, with the&s;e a|bove &s;tated&mdash;independant of what, would natural|ly re&s;uit, from the great object of exportation&mdash;which mu&s;t be highly productive to any country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the advantages, of &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ources of wealth, as are here found.</P>
<P>It is certain for many years, the exports will pa&s;s down the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi&mdash;but the imports, if the avenue was admitted to be opened, would now pa&s;s by way of Mobile and Tenne&s;&s;ee&mdash;and the various &s;treams with which the latter communicates.</P>
<P>From correct information I am induced to believe that with but little expence, the communication, between the navigable waters of Mobile and Ten|ne&s;&s;ee, may be &s;hortened, at lea&s;t 10, perhaps 15 miles: con&s;equently it cannot be improbable that the day will be, when the commerce of far greater part of We&s;tern America&mdash;North of the junction of Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, will concentre to this grand mart, formed by nature.</P>
<P>To me it appears &s;trange, that any government &s;hould deem it good policy, to withhold from a part of her citizens, the u&s;e of &s;treams formed for their benefit; while the nations having claims on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> borders, remain unoppo&s;ed to its exerci&s;e.</P>

<P>we continued at Natchez &s;everal days, in peace and harmony with our friends.</P>
<P>On the 18th in&s;tant, about the hour of twelve o'clock at night, my lodging was &s;urrounded with probably &s;ome few le&s;s than a battalion of federal troops, with fixed bayonets.

<PB N="42" REF="035360_0042_10049FB14196AD60">written by me mu&s;t po&s;itively be done in his pre|&s;ence. Some few days previous to my departure from confinement I was informed by a friend (who accidentally got an opportunity to &s;peak with me) that every mea&s;ure po&s;&s;ible was then pur&s;uing, by General Wilkin&s;on, and the Federal officers, to involve me in inevitable ruin. The mo&s;t ungerous reflections and unfavourable repre&s;entations were made to tho&s;e who were unacquainted with us; in fact no abu&s;e with them was too nefarious to be pre&s;cribed, and that if I re&s;pected my&s;elf or friends he advi&s;ed me if po&s;&s;ible to depart.</P>
<P>Under tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions I determined at every ri&s;que to leave my confinement.</P>
<P>On the 25th. of Sept. I told the officers of the Fort in the care of whom I was placed; that I would rather not exi&s;t than to be unju&s;tly and ille|gally confined, my friends would be injured, who had repo&s;ed implicit confidence in me; and I mu&s;t be involved in inevitable ruin; provided I was de|tained from pur&s;uing my lawfull bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>All I a&s;ked was that ju&s;tice the con&s;titution and laws of my country entitled me to, and rather than be denied that, I would cea&s;e to exi&s;t in this world.</P>
<P>Except &s;ome few contemptuous grins, the officers made little or no reply to my ob&s;ervations and pro|bably thought le&s;s of them.</P>
<P>On the 26th of September 1798 (with con&s;ider|able ri&s;que) I departed from Fort Panmeur of Natchez, on my way at the di&s;tance of fifteen leagues from New Orleans, I met a report that my&s;elf with a con&s;iderable number of men was on the way to plunder and harra&s;s the Spani&s;h &s;ettlers; and on my arrival at New Orleans, on the 3d. of October 1798. I was informed of the fact, that a
<PB N="43" REF="035360_0043_10049FB2D7A14548">letter from General Wilkin&s;on had arrived &s;ome few days previous, the contents of which will ap|pear in the following orders, publi&s;hed by the Go|vernor general of the Province of Loui&s;iana viz. I have ju&s;t now received an unque&s;tionable proof of the faith of the U. S. in the ob&s;ervance of the treaty by which the intere&s;t of our nations are &s;o happi|ly united.</P>
<P>General Wilkin&s;on informs me that a very large number of people without law or any nation all con&s;ideration have joined in the we&s;tern part of the U. S. with the perver&s;e de&s;ign of invading this province, and no other object than that of plundering its inhabitants and committing &s;uch exce&s;&s;es as may be expected from men with|out any di&s;cipline, who&s;e exi&s;tance is only &s;uppor|ted as long as their atrocities keep them out of the reach of de&s;erved puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The chief of tho&s;e banditti has under various pretexts deceived the commander of Fort Ma&s;&s;ac and was permitted to pa&s;s with a &s;mall party of his people, having pur&s;uaded him that they were going to hunting; but the main body went through the woods out of &s;ight of the Fort to embark about a league further; &s;aid General &s;up|po&s;es that the&s;e may be a part of the forces with which Blount intended to invade this province.</P>
<P>He has given me this timely information to the end that I might take &s;uch mea&s;ures as can prevent &s;o eminant a danger; the executive power of the U. S. has been long pur&s;uing that party of outlaw|ed people &s;o far as to &s;end troops again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The chief of tho&s;e vagabonds has been lately ar|re&s;ted in Natchez and I make no doubt but what the vigilence of that Government will continue to
<PB N="44" REF="035360_0044_10049FB71E25A2D8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">op the progre&s;s of tho&s;e malefactors.</P>
<P>Although the mea&s;ures which the government of the U.

My arrival at New-Orlean the moment I did, gave no &s;mall degree of &s;urpri&s;e to the citizens, as well as the Spani&s;h officers&mdash;and as to my own part I can only leave to my friends and fellow citizens to judge of the unplea&s;ant &s;ituation in which I was placed: a lone &s;tranger, &s;upported only by a con&s;|cious rectitude of my actions, and the profound ju&s;|tice of the Spani&s;h officers who are di&s;po&s;ed to be in amity with the United States, and to treat her citizens with ju&s;tice and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>On my arrival at New Orlean, I immediately waited on his excellency governor Gayo&s;o, to whom I &s;tated candidly my &s;ituation, and the object I had in view for making him a vi&s;it.&mdash;,&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The impartial can ju&s;tly figure to them&s;elves, the e&s;toni&s;hment with which I was received, and my embarra&s;ment when the unfavorable repre&s;en|tations which had been officially communicated, was pronounced to me; howeve truth as in all ca&s;es here, had its influence.</NOTE> I was treated politely; and am happy to have it in my power, to inform the world and my friends par|ticularly; that in his excellency Manuel Gayo&s;o De-lemos, I have had the plea&s;ure to find every principle that con&s;titutes the officer of ju&s;tice, gen|tleman of honour, humanity and benevolence.</P>

<P>Some &s;hort time after my arrival at New Or|leans, Wilkin&s;on, or Sergeant, perhaps both of them, demanded of governor Gayo&s;o the per&s;on of Zachr.
