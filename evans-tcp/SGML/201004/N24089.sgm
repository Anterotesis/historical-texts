<HEAD>OPINIONS RESPECTING THE COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE <HI>Vnited States</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A GREAT fundamental principle of action, applying to national intercour&s;e and tran&s;ac|tions of every kind, whether commercial or not, is, that one nation &s;hould not injure another: that national conduct &s;hould, upon all occa&s;ions, be frank and &s;incere; or that whatever might be the relative power, there &s;hould be no aim to over-reach, or to obtain unequal or improper advantages. The writers upon the law of nations agree in this great principle, as &s;pringing from the law of nature. From whence they infer, that treaties made, and to be kept, &s;hould have equality for their ba&s;is, let what may be the &s;tate and condition of the contracting parties; for as &s;uperiority of power creates no obli|gation, or right, "&s;o power or weakne&s;s," &s;ays Vat|tel, "does not, in this re&s;pect, produce any differ|ence." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 1. chap. 1. page 18.</NOTE> Equal treaties then, founded on equal rights, and conferring equal benefits, are alone obli|gatory by the law of nations. "Treaties equal," &s;ays Vattel, "are tho&s;e in which the contracting par|ties promi&s;e the &s;ame things, or things that are equiv|alent;

or, in &s;hort, that are equitably proportioned, &s;o that their condition is equal. Equal treaties may be &s;ubdivided into as many kinds as the &s;ove|reigns have different tran&s;actions between them. Thus they treat of the conditions of commerce,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 2. chap. 12. &s;ect. 172.</NOTE> &amp;c. "Nations not being le&s;s obliged than individuals, to have regard for equity, they ought, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, to pre&s;erve equality in their treaties; when, therefore, the parties are in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to obtain the <HI>&s;ame reciprocal advantages,</HI> the law of nature re|quires their treaties &s;hould be equal, at lea&s;t, if there is not &s;ome particular rea&s;on to deviate from that equality, &s;uch as gratitude for a former benefit,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vattel, book 11. chap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. &s;ect. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> &amp;c.

<P>To apply the foregoing ob&s;ervations, drawn from the law of nations, to a particular article of the Brit|i&s;h treaty, to determine its meaning and con&s;truction, it may not be improper, in the fir&s;t place, to recite the 14th article of the treaty at large, and then to in|quire, whether there is not &s;ufficient latitude, in its con&s;truction, to ju&s;tify &s;uch additional regulations of commerce, as &s;hall give that protection and &s;upport to the commerce and navigation of the United States, which reciprocity demands.</P>

<HEAD>14th ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>There &s;hall be between all the dominions of his Maje&s;ty in Europe and the territories of the United States, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of Com|merce and Navigation. The people and inhabi|tants of the two countries re&s;pectively &s;hall have liberty, freely and &s;ecurely, and without hindrance and mole&s;tation, to come, with their &s;hips and car|goes, to the lands, countries, cities, ports, places and rivers, within the dominions and territories

<P>If the &s;tipulation of a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce and navigation herein made, as well as the protection and &s;ecurity promi&s;ed to the mer|chants and traders on each &s;ide, is not &s;ufficiently ex|plicit, when it is declared, as to what re&s;pects the ar|ticle, to be always &s;ubject to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries re&s;pectively; &s;hould it be made a que&s;tion, whether a general &s;tipulation, under as gen|eral an exception, as to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries, &s;hall be con&s;trued to preclude the Le|gi&s;lature from making laws and &s;tatutes, which are nece&s;&s;ary to procure the reciprocity guarantied, or &s;uch laws and &s;tatutes as are founded in reciprocity and equality; and in the policy and practice of one of the contracting parties, the Briti&s;h? or whether it ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the other contracting party (the United States) &s;hould be tied down under the general &s;tipulation, and not allowed to protect its citizens and commerce again&s;t foreign interference? or whether a perfect liberty of commerce and naviga|tion ought to be granted on one &s;ide, again&s;t a very imperfect one on the other? or, in other words, whether the affected perfect liberty conferred by the treaty, marred by re&s;trictions and prohibitions, ought to reciprocate few, or no advantages on the one hand, whil&s;t the mo&s;t perfect liberty, common to every cit|izen of the United States, is allowed on the other, with the exception of an extra tonnage duty upon foreign ve&s;&s;els, and an addition of one tenth to the amount of the impo&s;t accruing upon their cargoes?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031857_0007_0FEE935263F45498">If &s;uch a con&s;truction is admitted, there is no room left on which legi&s;lation can exerci&s;e its powers; all future laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries being nece&s;&s;arily contravened. And although Briti&s;h mer|chants and traders might introduce practices injurious to the rights and intere&s;ts of the merchants and citi|zens of the United States, they would not be amen|able to laws made po&s;terior to the treaty; and of cour&s;e there might be a &s;et of foreigners, under the privileges of a general protection, committing inju|ries to the commerce of the country beyond the reach of legi&s;lative remedy.</P>
<P>If this con&s;truction was the one de&s;igned, why was the exception made as to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries? Was it to ratify and confirm Briti&s;h navigation acts, and the re&s;trictions and prohibitions of Briti&s;h &s;tatutes on the one &s;ide, and to leave no means to reciprocate &s;uch di&s;advantages on the other?</P>
<P>If this was intended, why was it not declared; and that no future laws or &s;tatutes &s;hould be made to limit or re&s;train the liberty therein given; in which ca&s;e, with what view, or to what purpo&s;e, was the &s;ucceeding, the 15th article, made?</P>
<P>The 15th article appears to be but an exception or a provi&s;o to the 14th; or if it is not, it has neither meaning nor &s;ignification: For if the legi&s;lative power was to be controled, in future, by the pro|vi&s;ions of the preceding article, of what con&s;equence was it to &s;tipulate, that "no other or higher duties <HI>&s;hall</HI> be paid by the &s;hips and merchandizes of the one party, in the ports of the other, than &s;uch as are paid, by the like ve&s;&s;els, on merchandize of all other na|tions"? or that "no other, or higher duty, &s;hould be impo&s;ed in one country, on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of the other, than are, or <HI>&s;hall be payable</HI> (mark this ex|pre&s;&s;ion) on the importation of the like articles, being of the growth, produce or manufacture of any other foreign nation"? Or of what import are the follow|ing
<PB N="11" REF="031857_0008_0FEF21AA70C95588">
words? <Q>Nor <HI>&s;hall</HI> any prohibition be impo&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any article, to or from the territories of the two parties re&s;pectively, which <HI>&s;hall</HI> not equally extend to all other na|tions.</Q> The reply is, that the 15th article mu&s;t become nugatory, and be without meaning or &s;igni|fication, if the unnatural con&s;truction aforementioned is admitted. The &s;tipulation of the 14th article ap|pears to guaranty a reciprocal liberty of commerce, and navigation, with protection and &s;ecurity to mer|chants and traders; but &s;ubject to the laws and &s;ta|tutes of the two countries re&s;pectively; provided &s;uch laws and &s;tatutes &s;hall conform to the provi&s;ions and limitations of the 15th article. Taking the two articles together, the con&s;tructions harmonize, and the legi&s;latures of the two countries are left only un|der the re&s;traints of reciprocity, as to commerce and navigation; that in ca&s;e either party &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to reciprocate what it &s;hould deem unequal, or di&s;advantageous, the regulations nece&s;&s;ary therefor mu&s;t extend to every other nation. This con&s;truc|tion gives to the treaty its true meaning, and con|forms to the law of nations, which exacts ju&s;tice and equality, as the ba&s;is of commercial and political tran&s;|actions. It is pre&s;umed then, that the United States have a clear, obvious right to pa&s;s &s;uch laws and &s;ta|tutes as are nece&s;&s;ary to equalize commercial advan|tages, and to give protection and &s;ecurity to their cit|izens again&s;t foreign interference.</P>
<P>Admitting the foregoing rea&s;oning to be ju&s;t, the next inquiry which ari&s;es out of our &s;ubject, is, What regulations does reciprocity require, on our part, to place the commerce of the two countries upon that footing of equality which wi&s;dom on the one &s;ide, and a liberal policy on the other, ought to demand?</P>
<P>To permit commercial intercour&s;e to take off the &s;urplus productions, beyond what are nece&s;&s;ary for home con&s;umption, is a duty that nations owe to the
<PB N="12" REF="031857_0009_0FEF21ADD448E6D0">
welfare and happine&s;s of each other; and the obliga|tion is no le&s;s &s;trong, that the exchanges &s;hould be founded in ju&s;tice and equity; for the moral princi|ple of nations does not permit unequal regulations of commerce; or, at lea&s;t, if they are a&s;&s;umed, or pro|cured through artifice or intrigue by the one party, it is made the duty of the other, by the law of na|tions, to re&s;i&s;t and to oppo&s;e them. In order then to examine the &s;ubject before us with clearne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inquire,

<P>In treating the important &s;ubject herein undertaken, it is proper to premi&s;e, that what is aimed to be e&s;|tabli&s;hed, re&s;ts as much upon facts, as deductions; upon commercial &s;tatements, as political inferences. The facts depended on, are the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;tate|ments of Great-Britain, and tho&s;e official documents, and other references, which were thought &s;ufficient data, on which to ground that &s;y&s;tem of rules and regulations, by which Great-Britain is, and has been guided in her commerce with this country. A re|currence to the &s;ame facts and authorities, which, it is conceived, are the be&s;t the &s;ubject admits, cannot be deemed unfair, to &s;hew the inequality and danger of the United States from &s;uch regulations, and the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting and oppo&s;ing them by counter regulations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of inquiry herein propo&s;ed, referring to the comparative benefits re&s;ulting from the com|mercial and maritime regulations of the two coun|tries, &s;hall be con&s;idered under their di&s;tinct heads, as far as the nature of the &s;ubject will permit.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to the regulations above recited, it is to be ob&s;erved, that they were repeated the Decem|ber following, and have been, from time to time, &s;ince continued, with little alteration in their principle, by acts which have pa&s;&s;ed, at every &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, authorizing his Maje&s;ty to make them; and they are now confirmed, with the approbation of the United States, in the ratification of the late treaty with Brit|ain,
<PB N="15" REF="031857_0012_0FEF21B8CBF94AD8">
viz. in the 14th article aforementioned, which &s;ubjects the liberty of commerce, therein given, "to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries re&s;pectively." It is but ju&s;tice to the treaty, however, to &s;ay, that the provi&s;ions of the 12th article, which were refu&s;ed ratification by the United States, were intended as a mitigation to the injuries and inequalities of the&s;e reg|ulations. The conce&s;&s;ions therein made, by the Brit|i&s;h government, although unequal to the &s;acrifices, by the United States, in other parts of the treaty, might have been of &s;ome commercial advantage; but they were accompanied with &s;uch indignities to the freedom and independence of the country, in re|lation to productions from the dominions of other &s;tates, that they could not be accepted.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to ob&s;erve upon the detail, it will be proper to make a few ob&s;ervations upon the principle of the foregoing regulations.</P>
<P>They hold up an important di&s;tinction between the European and the other dominions of Great-Britain, in the allowance of commerce with the United States. If this di&s;tinction was proper, why did it not go fur|ther, and extend the &s;ame re&s;triction to Ireland, which is no more than a Briti&s;h colony; or to Scotland or Wales, or to all of them; for there would have been equal propriety in extending the re&s;trictions further, even to all the Briti&s;h dominions, whether in Europe or el&s;ewhere, which, it is believed, would have been mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of the United States, as to have limited the re&s;trictions to the Engli&s;h colonies only? In &s;uch ca&s;e, the United States would have &s;een through the equity of the regulations, and governed them&s;elves accordingly. As well might the United States &s;ay, that liberty of commerce &s;hould be grant|ed to the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, except with Vir|ginia, South-Carolina and Georgia, and with them, &s;o far as to permit the citizens of the United States to tran&s;port tobacco, rice, and naval &s;tores to Great-Britain, if &s;hipped in American bottoms, with liberty
<PB N="16" REF="031857_0013_0FEF21BA51208968">
to import into tho&s;e &s;tates, in like bottoms, Engli&s;h manufactures, with the exception of woolen cloths, cottons, and &s;ome other principal Briti&s;h merchandiz|es, which &s;hould be totally prohibited.</P>
<P>Whenever a nation &s;ets up a principle of action, as a rule of commercial or political conduct, which is to operate upon the commerce or policy of other nations, it is becoming, that it &s;hould regard ju&s;tice and equity, in relation to &s;uch nations with which &s;he has political or commercial tran&s;actions. It is not &s;ufficient for a nation to &s;ay, that &s;he has colonies, which, becau&s;e &s;he has planted, &s;he will wantonly exclude from other nations, and monopolize to her&s;elf their commerce and labour: nor is it &s;ufficient, that this principle be fortified by the u&s;ages and practices of nations; or that Grotius, Puffendorf, Burlamaqui, and Vattel, implicitly or explicitly ju&s;tify it. Two con&s;iderations, in their nature previous to the adoption of &s;uch a rule, enter into its exerci&s;e, and ought to make its principle; the fir&s;t is, whether it is for the be&s;t intere&s;t of the parent &s;tate as connected with the lea&s;t injury to the inhabitants of her colonies: and the &s;econd, whether it is for her be&s;t intere&s;t as connected with tho&s;e advan|tages &s;he derives from the commerce of other &s;tates. Admitting the right of monopoly over colonies, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e that protection and power can give it, it does not follow, that the inhabitants of colonies have no claim upon the parent &s;tate, from &s;ituation and humanity, from circum&s;tances and ex|pedients, in procuring their own welfare, with the objects of their e&s;tabli&s;hment: although the parent &s;tate is &s;overeign, and colonies &s;hould be &s;ubordinate; and &s;hould produce, &s;ay indefea&s;ible right, on the one &s;ide; and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other; yet un|nece&s;&s;ary and cruel deprivations cannot be ju&s;tified under &s;uch a claim. Their circum&s;tances and &s;itua|tion, their internal and external relations, mu&s;t pro|duce a choice of means, which mu&s;t de&s;ignate the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and policy of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued.
<PB N="17" REF="031857_0014_0FEF21BD9C443C90">
To &s;ay then, that colonies have no rights, but &s;uch as are ab&s;orbed in the mere will of the metropolitan &s;tate, is ab&s;urd: nor le&s;s &s;o, would it be to &s;ay, that it would be always for the intere&s;t of the metropolitan &s;tate to exclude foreigners from a participation in its colonial commerce; for &s;uch a regulation &s;hould ari&s;e rather from policy than right, and mu&s;t depend upon the liquidation of advantages and di&s;advantages, in its commerce with other &s;tates: if the right is a&s;&s;umed, the policy may be denied, and the metropolitan &s;tate may become the lo&s;er from its a&s;&s;umption. In &s;uch ca&s;e, it had been better to have adhered to the policy, rather than the right. The concurrence, then, of both the one, and the other, mu&s;t be brought into view, to determine the fitne&s;s and propriety of &s;uch com|mercial regulations. The right then re&s;ts preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame footing, which every independent country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of regulating its own commerce, to extend, to limit, or totally to prohibit it, with foreign nations, leaving the &s;ame right to the nation affected by &s;uch regulations, which mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, at length reduce the right to a mere que&s;tion of policy.</P>
<P>Let us examine then, whether right and policy concur, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to ju&s;tify Great-Britain in excluding the citizens of the United States from a participation in the commerce and navigation of her We&s;t-India i&s;lands, admitting the right and power of retaliation in the United States, which &s;hall hereafter be &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Whenever we reflect upon what was the relative &s;ituation of the United States and the Engli&s;h We&s;t-India colonies, that we were the offspring of the &s;ame parent, e&s;tabli&s;hed and protected by the &s;ame power, and nouri&s;hed and cheri&s;hed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, viz. the aggrandizement of the Briti&s;h empire; without entering into the di&s;putes which brought on the American revolution; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that there was, before the revolution, a clo&s;e, intimate and beneficial commercial connection, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the

Engli&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands and the now United States. Mutual wants and conveniences were its foundation, which contributed not le&s;s to the growth and pro&s;peri|ty of the then re&s;pective colonies, than to the opulence and grandeur of the mother country.</P>
<P>To &s;ever and cut off a commercial intercour&s;e, &s;pringing from &s;ituation, interwoven by habit, and cemented by &s;o many ties of intere&s;t and convenience, ought to be ju&s;tified by arguments of more &s;olidity than the independence of the United States, or the mere right of monopoly over the trade and produce of colonies.</P>
<P>It is admitted, that the citizens of the two coun|tries, by the &s;overeignty and independence of the United States, became aliens to each other, and that each country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a &s;en&s;e, the right of limit|ing, re&s;tricting, or prohibiting its commerce, as it might deem be&s;t; yet, when a narrow, illiberal pol|icy, bottomed upon re&s;entment and di&s;appointment, rather than its real intere&s;t, or the convenience or ad|vantage of its colonies, became adopted into a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations, &s;uch a conduct, if proved, mu&s;t de&s;erve reprobation and reproach, and in the end will produce defen&s;ory mea&s;ures, which &s;hall re|quite their inju&s;tice. Several of the &s;tates, in the year 1784, in their individual capacities, as well as the Engli&s;h We&s;t-India merchants and planters, made in|effectual efforts to procure the repeal of the&s;e offen&s;ive regulations. The latter, that is, the Engli&s;h mer|chants and planters, petitioned the Engli&s;h parliament, pointing out the injurious con&s;equences of the regu|lations of commerce to the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; that they were founded in ill policy and re&s;entment, and would induce a retaliation on the part of the United States. The &s;tates of Virginia, New-York, New-Jer|&s;ey, and Maryland, pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions upon the &s;ub|ject, con&s;idering them as aggre&s;&s;ions upon the com|merce of the &s;tates, and &s;trongly recommending countervailing re&s;trictions. The &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts

pa&s;&s;ed a navigation act, with an expectation it would have been followed by &s;imilar acts from the other &s;tates, which was to have been in force until Congre&s;s &s;hould have been empowered to regulate trade: but it not being &s;econded by any other &s;tate than Rhode-I&s;land, it was repealed, for the want of a more general concurrence. Thus ended the prophe|cies of retaliation by Engli&s;h writers, and We&s;t-India planters; and thus became fruitle&s;s, the individual attempts of &s;everal of the &s;tates to remedy the inju|ries and cruelties of the&s;e pernicious regulations of commerce.</P>
<P>Mankind don't admini&s;ter to the rights of others &s;o much from duty as from fear; it is by retaliation, that nations mu&s;t make their rights and intere&s;ts re|&s;pected, when they are infringed. The United States, untaught by experience, and not having provided again&s;t the evils, which awaited their independence, for &s;ix years were laid under Briti&s;h commercial bon|dage, and patiently &s;uffered their navigation, com|merce, and manufactures, to be almo&s;t cut up by the roots, for the want of tho&s;e defen&s;ory re&s;trictions, which were nece&s;&s;ary to their protection. The&s;e in|juries, &s;en&s;ibly as they were felt, had their attendant benefits; they afforded an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to the hone&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting politics of our country. Great-Britain, under the deceitful appearance of tendering to us the liberal hand of friend&s;hip and reconciliation, at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, di&s;armed us of our pru|dence; and, by her commercial arrangements, even put to hazard the very independence for which we had contended, and achieved. The &s;everal &s;tates &s;aw the evil, which was &s;apping their be&s;t intere&s;ts, jealous of their &s;overeignties, and di&s;tracted by oppo&s;ing &s;en|timents, from the defect of the old organization of Congre&s;s; and from the nece&s;&s;ity of a power to reg|ulate commerce, the great actuating motive for the adoption of a Federal Con&s;titution, the now Con&s;ti|tution of the United States became accepted, and ap|proved

by the people, tru&s;ting, that its re&s;ult would produce a conduct from Great-Britain more con&s;o|nant to equity, and to tho&s;e advantages &s;he was daily deriving from the commerce of the United States. But Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, hitherto knowing the influence of language, habits, manners, fa&s;hions, and credits; knowing the difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments attend|ant on the altering of old channels of commerce; knowing her power to circum&s;cribe her own mar|kets, whil&s;t ours were open to her manufactures; knowing the prejudicies and jealou&s;ies &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the &s;everal &s;tates, &s;he has even procured a pre|ference in our own ports, through her merchants and factors, for the employment of her &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, to tho&s;e of the United States: and the United States, for &s;everal years, exhibited a &s;ituation as novel as it was ab&s;urd; foreign &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els finding in our ports ample and ready freights, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the United States, circumvented by Briti&s;h re&s;trictions, were rotting at our wharves, for want of employ.</P>
<P>It is by the &s;ettled tendency of mea&s;ures, rather than by profe&s;&s;ions and declarations, that we mu&s;t judge of the friend&s;hip or enmity of nations: we need not recur, for in&s;tance, to the hi&s;tories of either France or England, to know their enmity and hatred to each other: a recurrence to their laws, and to their rules of commerce, will &s;ufficiently di&s;cover their pa&s;|&s;ions and re&s;entments, perhaps more &s;trongly than the hi&s;tory of their battles. Accident, mi&s;take, or occurrences, from a thou&s;and circum&s;tances, might produce temporary ho&s;tilities; but in the &s;ettled rules and regulations of their general and commercial pol|icy, their hatred, their malice, and their rivalries, will be more fully de&s;ignated: in like manner, if we re|cur to the Engli&s;h regulations of commerce, adopted towards this country, in the face of the petitions and remon&s;trances of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Engli&s;h merchants and We&s;t-India planters, to point to their leading motives, <HI>we cannot doubt, that extreme &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,

and a marked re&s;entment again&s;t the United States general|ly, and the New-England &s;tates in particular, for their manly conduct in the revolution, were the chief objects and end of their policy.</HI> Circum&s;tanced and &s;ituated as the New-England States particularly were, at the clo&s;e of the war, can the narrow, &s;elfi&s;h, bigoted policy of a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter be ju&s;tified in denouncing their navi|gation, fi&s;heries, and commerce, by the mo&s;t &s;udden, cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive regulations? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the New-England &s;tates can have witne&s;&s;ed the ten|dency of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and ob&s;erve them continued and per&s;i&s;ted in, and yet be taught, as &s;ome among&s;t us affect to in&s;truct us, that an Engli&s;h alliance ought to be courted and preferred to all others? if alliances with re&s;trictions and prohibitions ought to be court|ed; if they are marks of friend&s;hip, a New-England|man might well a&s;k, what are indications of enmity, &s;hort of open ho&s;tility? whil&s;t he will apo&s;trophize and &s;ay, From &s;uch friend&s;hip, and &s;uch regulations of commerce, good Lord deliver us!</P>
<P>But as it would be unwarrantable, and it is not my intention, to mi&s;repre&s;ent, either the de&s;igns or the policy of the Briti&s;h government, it is fitting that the facts and &s;tatements, on which the foregoing &s;ugge&s;tions are grounded, &s;hould be laid before the public.</P>
<P N="1">1. The citizens of the United States and their ve&s;&s;els were excluded commercial intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands, whereby the employ|ment of above thirty thou&s;and tons of American &s;hipping was totally interdicted, be&s;ides the di&s;advan|tage of a great diminution, both in the vent of Amer|ican productions, and in the &s;upply of tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies, which aro&s;e from confining the carrying trade, in both directions, to Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="2">2. The following important articles of the pro|duce of the United States, particularly tho&s;e of the New-England &s;tates, were totally prohibited to be im|ported into the Engli&s;h We&s;t-India colonies, either in

Briti&s;h or American bottoms, viz. beef, pork, &s;alted fi&s;h, whale oil, &s;permaceti candles, &amp;c. whereby the New-England &s;tates &s;u&s;tained an annual lo&s;s of vent or market for upwards of <Q>fifteen thou&s;and barrels of beef and pork, two hundred and thirty thou&s;and quintals of fi&s;h, about five hundred tons of whale oil,</Q> which, with the other articles of the growth and produce of the United States annually &s;hipped to the Engli&s;h We&s;t-Indies, amounted, by the Briti&s;h ac|counts, to not le&s;s than a million &s;terling, which not only &s;upplied them with the produce of the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, viz. with <Q>three million &s;ix hundred thou|&s;and gallons of We&s;t-India rum, three thou&s;and hog&s;heads, fifteen hundred tierces and four thou|&s;and barrels of &s;ugar, one hundred and fifty thou|&s;and gallons of mola&s;&s;es, with coffee to the amount of &pound;50,000 &s;terling; cocoa, mahogany plank, pi|menta, ginger, cotton wool, fu&s;tick, logwood, and lignum-vitae, to the amount of &pound;. 60,000 &s;terling, be&s;ides a balance in ca&s;h of &pound;.240,000 &s;terling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brian Edwards's pamphlet, re&s;pecting the trade of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands with the United States.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It was natural for the un&s;u&s;pecting politics of the United States to &s;uppo&s;e that Great-Britain had &s;o much to gain, by permitting their commerce to take its old channels, and in the end, &s;o much to lo&s;e, if they would not permit it, that the general balance of the whole trade was &s;o much to the advantage of Great-Britain, by receiving an annual balance from the United States of above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides the immen&s;e advantage ari&s;ing from the freightage of the produce of the United States, that &s;he would not, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, aim to pro&s;cribe her markets to American ve&s;&s;els; nor to carry into effect again&s;t them, her illiberal &s;y&s;tem of re&s;trictions and prohibitions upon foreigners, and foreign ve&s;&s;els, to the di&s;advantage of any particu|lar part of the commerce of the United States, e&s;pecial|ly of the New-England &s;tates: but in this, the United
<PB N="23" REF="031857_0020_0FEF21CE8F5402E0">
States have found them&s;elves deceived, and Great-Britain has hitherto been able to &s;upport her narrow, &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations, unretaliated by the United States, through her machinations and intrigues, in the government of the United States.</P>
<P>But the nece&s;&s;ity of revi&s;ing the commercial &s;y&s;tem of the United States does not re&s;t, merely, upon the Engli&s;h colonial arrangements, but mu&s;t be con&s;idered in connection with her European &s;y&s;tem of commer|cial policy; and in relation to the di&s;tinctions and di&s;abilities, which the laws of England impo&s;e, between foreigners and Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Although merchant &s;trangers enjoy important priv|ileges in England, compared with tho&s;e of &s;ome other countries of Europe, except Holland; that when friends, they have a con&s;titutional right of re&s;idence, and a legal protection to their per&s;ons and properties, extending even to the right of holding real e&s;tate, when not to their own u&s;e, they are &s;till under nu|merous di&s;abilities, and &s;ubject to peculiar impo&s;itions, which, although le&s;&s;ening, &s;ays Judge Black&s;tone, "from the commercial intere&s;t and policy of the nation," yet they create important di&s;tinctions be|tween natives and foreigners, to the benefit of the one, and to the prejudice of the other. To the&s;e im|po&s;itions, numerous as they are, &s;ay Briti&s;h mini&s;ters, the citizens of the United States became &s;ubject from their independence! and what rendered them the more injurious, was, that they had been the ground, and rea&s;on, on which the commerce of the United States had, in many ca&s;es, been predicated. A con|&s;picuous example of the fact herein &s;tated, well known to the people of New-England, is the alien duty of &pound;.18-3 &s;terling per ton on foreign train oil, original|ly intended, as it now continues to be, a prohibition upon its importation into England; whereby the employment of one hundred and thirty &s;ail of our ve&s;&s;els, or thirteen thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping, in our whale fi&s;hery, was laid under &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ments,

<P>Upon the &s;ame principle, American built &s;hips were prohibited &s;ale in Briti&s;h ports; or, what was the &s;ame thing, the prohibitions and re&s;trictions of the Engli&s;h navigation act de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h market for the &s;ale of American built ve&s;&s;els, which, before the revolution, Great-Britain had been in the habit of purcha&s;ing, deriving, at lea&s;t, two fifths of her &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els from the built of America, amount|ing to about two hundred and ten thou&s;and tons, which, if renewed every &s;even years, the time allow|ed, by Briti&s;h accounts, for the duration of American built ve&s;&s;els, an annual vent for thirty thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping became lo&s;t to the United States; which, if calculated at &s;ix pounds &s;terling per ton, including their &s;ails and rigging, without reckoning their freight to England, amounted to one hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.

But when we have had &s;o unfavourable a balance, &s;o immen&s;e in its amount, when applied to Great-Britain, that the demand for Briti&s;h manufactures, in&s;tead of relaxing, has acquired force, from our commercial policy: that the manu|factures, which had grown up under the re&s;trictions and prohibitions of the &s;everal &s;tates, had been grad|ually expiring; whereby the intermediate relations between hu&s;bandmen and merchants have almo&s;t wholly &s;ub&s;ided: that what had been called protect|ing duties, whether ari&s;ing from in&s;ufficiency in their

<P>The fitne&s;s and propriety of commercial intercour&s;e depends on calculation, and minute inve&s;tigation of advantages and di&s;advantages: To &s;uppo&s;e that an object of &s;uch importance ought to re&s;t merely on the ca&s;ual, tran&s;ient information of the members of a Legi&s;lature, would &s;eem improper; or, at lea&s;t, it has been deemed &s;o, by the Briti&s;h nation, as long ago as Cromwell's time, (1665), when a board of commi&s;|&s;ioners of trade and plantations was e&s;tabli&s;hed; which, although afterwards laid down for a time, was revived in the year 1696, under the admini&s;tration of King William. To this board, the Briti&s;h nation owes its principal commercial pro&s;perity: its bu&s;ine&s;s has been, from time to time, to recommend altera|tions in the trade laws; to &s;tate "favourable, or un|favourable balances of trade, with foreign nations; and to receive propo&s;als for the ca&s;e and improvement of navigation, manufactures, and commerce." By the con&s;titution of the board, it was to con&s;i&s;t of mem|bers, having a "<HI>thorough knowledge of the general &s;tate, hi&s;tory, and intere&s;ts of commerce.</HI> How far an e&s;tab|li&s;hment of this &s;ort, would be worth the con&s;idera|tion of our government, is not the pre&s;ent inquiry, any further than to &s;hew, that the navigation, man|ufactures, and commerce of a country, and the pla|cing
<PB N="32" REF="031857_0029_0FEF21F2CADB76F8">
them in a ju&s;t relation to each other, and to for|eign nations, are objects of the highe&s;t importance, demanding the attention of government, particularly in relation to the policy of &s;uch nations, with which we have unfavourable balances.</P>
<P>There are writers, among whom is Mr. Hume,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 5th e&s;&s;ay, vol. 2.</NOTE> who have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the received, if not e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, in re&s;pect to balances of trade, were errone|ous, and without foundation; and that &s;uch balances would find their own level: that the precious metals were no other than merchandize, which would have a value with regard to commodities, or other proper|ty, in proportion to their plenty or &s;carcity: that if money was more plenty than other property, it would be of a le&s;s comparative value; and that if commodi|ties, or other property, were plentier than money, that it would be of a comparative greater: that if a country had accidentally loft the greater part of its circulating medium, that the remaining quantity would &s;till be a mean of transferring property, at a proportionably le&s;s price: and that, therefore, a nation had nothing to do, but to attend to its indu&s;try, and that trade would balance it&s;elf. However plau&s;i|ble and &s;olacing this theory is, and however well in|tended it may have been, for the people and times in which it was &s;ugge&s;ted, the government of England never thought the principle worthy of their atten|tion, but aims at pre&s;erving a general balance in its favour; and con&s;iders every trade pernicious, which carries a balance again&s;t her; and the more &s;o, in proportion to the increa&s;e of &s;uch balance. Profe&s;&s;or Smith concurs, in &s;ome points, with Mr. Hume, in regard to balances of trade; but confe&s;&s;es, that there is a balance of <Q>produce, and con&s;umption, which, as it happens to be either favourable or unfavour|able, nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions the pro&s;perity or decay of a nation;" "if the exchangeable value of the an|nual produce," &s;ays this excellent writer, "falls &s;hort of the annual con&s;umption, the capital of the
<PB N="33" REF="031857_0030_0FEF21FA44A88910">
&s;ociety mu&s;t annually decay in proportion to this deficiency. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith on the wealth of nations, vol. 2. chap. 3d. part 2d. page 208.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But admitting Mr. Hume's po&s;ition to be true, in an ab&s;tract view, it does not follow, that trade ought to be left to it&s;elf, and to the commercial impo&s;itions, that other nations may put upon it; for a commer|cial law extends beyond the juri&s;diction of the gov|ernment making it: it may go to the denying, cur|tailing, or extending the privileges of other nations; even to the giving a preference of one nation to an|other. In proportion as &s;uch a law limits, re&s;tricts, or denies commercial intercour&s;e to other nations, the a&s;&s;umed juri&s;diction, if unretaliated, becomes per|nicious and injurious. In this ca&s;e, a commercial, may have the effect of a political law, operating either upon other nations generally, or to extend the power of one &s;tate, whil&s;t it may be a mean of de|pre&s;&s;ing that of another: it may give advantages, with or without receiving equivalents; it may deny benefits, when more than equivalents are be&s;towed, if the nation receiving the di&s;advantages, will permit them: but if the re&s;trictive operation of the law &s;hould be retaliated, as it ought to be, the commercial inter|cour&s;e might dimini&s;h, or be &s;u&s;pended for a time, until both parties &s;hould find it convenient to make mutual conce&s;&s;ions. Since, by regulating trade then, it may be &s;o contrived, as to produce favourable or unfavourable balances, &s;o a nation, for the mo&s;t part, paying an unfavourable balance, may mo&s;t commonly conclude, that in ca&s;e of its taking place, it ari&s;es from unju&s;t and &s;elfi&s;h trade laws in other nations, which require, and ought to be retaliated. For one of three things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from an unfavourable balance of trade, when the commodities imported are con&s;umed, and are not re-exported. 1. The &s;pecie mu&s;t either be exported, to pay the unfavourable bal|ance:&mdash;or, 2. it mu&s;t be made up from the exce&s;s, in the commerce with other &s;tates;&mdash;or, 3. it mu&s;t re|main a debt again&s;t the country.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="031857_0031_0FEF21FBC8CFD048">With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, whatever may have been &s;aid by Mr. Hume, that a circulating medium will regulate it&s;elf, and that no country need be apprehen|&s;ive from its exports, whil&s;t it has population, and the means of indu&s;try; yet every &s;tate mu&s;t feel appre|hen&s;ive for its &s;afety and welfare, from depreciating the value of property, in relation to the precious met|als, when &s;uch changes are known to lay the founda|tions of inju&s;tice, and to produce di&s;tru&s;t, di&s;order, and confu&s;ion in every country. For example, we need but to retrace events a few years back, in our own country, to know the cau&s;e and effect of the lo&s;s of our circulating medium. The heavy balances due to Great-Britain, from cutting off our u&s;ual remittances, by her commercial regulations, produced the unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, di&s;tru&s;ts, and confu&s;ions of the year 1786. The people, who had contracted debts, and made promi&s;es of &s;pecie at one rate of value, found them&s;elves utterly unable, from its undue exportation, to fulfil them at another, i. e. an enhanced one, ari&s;ing out of its &s;car|city;&mdash;for in&s;tance, he who had bought a hundred bu&s;hels of grain, and gave his note for it, at a given price, payable at an advanced period, &s;ay twelve months, found that it would require more than double the quantity of grain to di&s;charge his note. In &s;hort, &s;uch were the di&s;orders introduced into the money tran&s;actions of the country, through this fertile &s;ource of public calamity, that public and private credit were for a long time &s;u&s;pended, and confu&s;ion and di&s;affec|tion to government, in &s;ome in&s;tances, grew out of the unfavourable balances of trade, grounded on Briti&s;h regulations of commerce.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the liquidating an unfavourable balance of trade with one country by a favourable one with another, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a mean too precarious and uncertain to be calculated upon, in a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations; for it cannot be expected to continue longer than until the nations, with which we have favourable balances, &s;hall become
<PB N="35" REF="031857_0032_0FEF21FD53CC6F88">
apprized of their &s;ituation and intere&s;t. For in&s;tance; Can it rationally be expected, that France, with which we have had, before the pre&s;ent European war, a more favourable balance of trade than with any other na|tion, amounting to 2,068,348 dollars, will not put further re&s;trictions upon our commerce, or demand an equivalent, in &s;ome form or other; e&s;pecially when &s;he finds, that the balance &s;he pays to the United States, goes to feed and to nouri&s;h the commerce and power of her enemy? Every nation ought, then, to expect an unequal commerce will be retaliated, and that it will be re&s;tricted and retrenched, as times and opportunity pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Although there was a balance of trade of 235,975 dollars, in the year 1790, again&s;t the United States, yet it has been &s;aid, that it has been &s;ometimes in their favour; but a little reflection upon what took place, prior to the pre&s;ent European war, will not only &s;hew the &s;ugge&s;tion unfounded; but will &s;ufficiently prove, that unle&s;s additional protection had been given to the commerce of the United States, what with the old debts due to Great-Britain, and tho&s;e which were daily accruing, there was much rea&s;on to fear, that the Engli&s;h commerce would, in a few years, have ab&s;orbed the greater part, or all, of the per&s;onal property of the country; as the in&s;ufficiency of the exports was made up, for &s;everal years, out of the public &s;ecurities, bank &s;tocks, and an exten&s;ive &s;ale of our wild lands in England; and although the&s;e operated as remit|tances to a va&s;t amount, comprehending, as it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, one half of the national bank &s;tocks, and one third, at lea&s;t, of the public debt of the United States; yet the concurrence of the&s;e circum&s;tances was not &s;ufficient to reduce the price of bills of ex|change. If the&s;e then are facts, and that they are, a reference to people in trade, and to the rates of ex|change, until the beginning of the pre&s;ent European war, will fully evince;&mdash;mu&s;t it not, then, be a &s;erious cau&s;e of alarm, to &s;ee the &s;ame pernicious commercial
<PB N="36" REF="031857_0033_0FEF21FEDC41EAD0">
&s;y&s;tem per&s;i&s;ted in, almo&s;t without a &s;ugge&s;tion, or an attempt, to retaliate the commercial policy of England? Well might the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter exult, as he did, in the year 1790, that the independence of the United States had co&s;t nothing to Great-Britain; that &s;o far from its proving an injury, it had &s;aved the heavy ex|pen&s;e of their protection; whil&s;t Great-Britain had derived greater commercial benefits, from the United States, than when they were colonies: or, in other words, that the American independence had been, and would continue, but a name, whil&s;t a phy&s;ical depend|ence could be retained by commerce.</P>
<P>If the power of regulating commerce, given to the United States, implies an obligation, it mu&s;t have been intended, that the commerce &s;hould be &s;o man|aged, that the annual imports &s;hould not exceed the exports; or that the productions of foreign countries &s;hould not be con&s;umed out of proportion to the means of paying for them, by the productions of the United States; for any thing &s;hort of this, is not the regulation, but the mi&s;management of commerce; for the term regulation carries with it, the idea of a ju&s;t and proper method of management, which can|not be the ca&s;e, if this principle is unattended to.</P>
<P>Baron Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu, book 20, chap. 12 and 13.</NOTE> that the liberty of commerce depends upon its re&s;traints; that it does not con&s;i&s;t, on the one hand, in an unbridled freedom to traders; nor yet in unju&s;t impo&s;itions for the &s;ake of revenue, on the other: that government &s;hould &s;tand neuter between its commerce and revenues, and not &s;uffer the intere&s;ts of the latter to encroach upon the rights of the former. In &s;hort, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone, book 3. ch. 13. vol. 3. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">17.</NOTE> the law maxim of <HI>&s;ic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas,</HI> &s;eems &s;trongly to apply, both as to the individual liberty of commerce, and to the rules and regulations nece&s;&s;ary to produce it; on the exten&s;ion of which, mu&s;t principally de|pend the public economy:&mdash;Public economy exacts,
<PB N="37" REF="031857_0034_0FEF2206B19E9B30">
that the public income &s;hould not exceed the public expenditure:&mdash;In this ca&s;e, the annual exports are the income, and the annual imports the expenditure; which, if the regulations of commerce do not con|trol, &s;o that the latter &s;hould not exceed the former, it is a &s;ure mark, that the commerce is not &s;ufficient|ly re&s;trained. The impo&s;t laws of the United States allow the importation of every thing from abroad, whether wanted or not, on payment of the &s;tipulated duties; but to allow the importation of &s;uch articles, which we do not want, or can procure among&s;t our|&s;elves, mu&s;t le&s;&s;en the capacity to obtain what we actually &s;tand in need of. If we expend equally in what we do, and do not want, we mu&s;t have a redu|ced quantity of what we do want, by the amount of the expenditure in what we do not want. To le&s;&s;en foreign importations, then, it is nece&s;&s;ary to prohibit entry to &s;uch articles as we can rai&s;e or manufacture among&s;t our&s;elves in &s;ufficient quantities, to &s;upply the demand. High duties, by &s;ome called protecting duties, are &s;eldom collected, or very imperfectly &s;o, <HI>in countries even le&s;s &s;uited to conceal &s;muggling than the United States;</HI> from whence it may be inferred, that prohi|bitions will afford greater &s;ecurity to American manu|factures, than what are called protecting duties, which offer temptation to &s;muggling, produce little or no revenue, and ju&s;tify the &s;ale, u&s;e, and con&s;umption of &s;uch manufactures, which merit an exclu&s;ion. Sure it is, that means more effectual, than tho&s;e which have been hitherto devi&s;ed, are nece&s;&s;ary to re|duce the ruinous and growing balance of trade, again&s;t the United States, in favour of Great-Britain. The &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts prohibited the importation from abroad, of many articles of home produce, and manufacture, in the year 1786, which had a benefi|cial effect, as to &s;everal of the articles; for whil&s;t the prohibition &s;hut out foreign importation, &s;uch was the competition produced in their manufacture, that many of the articles were &s;upplied at a le&s;s price than
<PB N="38" REF="031857_0035_0FEF220A723E7128">
before their importation was prohibited.

The be&s;t vent for the productions of every country, is that of its riche&s;t citizens, who, if &s;upplied with what they u&s;e, through foreign nations, mu&s;t pro&s;trate all efforts to improvement, and leave to the native farmers and arti&s;ans, the &s;upply of the poorer citizens only, who are unable to purcha&s;e, but of the inferior kinds.

If laws are intended to prevent public evils; if the impo&s;t laws, particularly, can be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to le&s;&s;en luxury, to influence manners, and to induce habits of indu&s;try, economy, and moderation, ought not con&s;iderations of this &s;ort to have weight in a re|publican government?

<P>Another object, perhaps of no le&s;s importance than what has been before intimated, to reduce an unfav|ourable balance of trade, may not be improper here to &s;ugge&s;t: it is a mea&s;ure of no le&s;s con&s;equence than to &s;ecure the commi&s;&s;ions, or factorage, upon the &s;up|ply of our own markets with the productions and merchandizes of foreign countries: and it is conceiv|ed, that no better &s;ugge&s;tion, for the purpo&s;e, can be readily offered, <HI>than an alien duty upon goods, wares, or productions of foreign countries, &s;hipped for, or con&s;igned to

any other, than an American citizen; and that no draw|back &s;hould be allowed upon the exportation of articles, oth|erwi&s;e &s;hipped or con&s;igned, which had previou&s;ly paid duty upon importation:</HI> By a mea&s;ure of this &s;ort, the Unit|ed States might calculate a &s;aving, at lea&s;t, of two millions of dollars annually, which the commi&s;&s;ions upon importation and exportation, calculated at 5 per cent. with incidental charges, would at lea&s;t amount to.</P>
<P>American merchants, con&s;idered as &s;uch, in relation to their country, &s;tand in an important point of view; they are to be regarded as the in&s;truments of com|munication with foreign countries, of exciting do|me&s;tic indu&s;try, of diffu&s;ing pro&s;perity and wealth, and of holding the capitals of the country, to be re|curred to, in ca&s;es of exigence or nece&s;&s;ity. To &s;up|po&s;e that per&s;ons, of this re&s;pectable cla&s;s, ought not to find protection, in preference to tho&s;e of foreign nations, is to con&s;ider that foreign merchants are not bound by ties and connections, which attach them to their native country; and that their opinions and &s;entiments are dive&s;ted of tho&s;e partialities, which commonly actuate the human heart. So fully do the Engli&s;h laws recognize this principle of attachment to their native country, that they &s;uppo&s;e, if a merchant &s;hall even a&s;&s;ume a foreign allegiance, that it is only <HI>"local and temporary,"</HI> and that his natural allegiance is a perpetual, actuating principle, from which he can|not be withdrawn without the "concurrent act of the government to which it was fir&s;t due." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone, book 1. chap. 10. p. 370.</NOTE> This principle of the Engli&s;h law is likewi&s;e concurrent to another, quite as generally received, and better un|der&s;tood, which is, <HI>that the profits obtained in commerce, if carried on by foreigners, will be expended out of the country, in which they were procured.</HI></P>
<P>When we reflect upon the numerous evils, ari&s;ing from the profits of labour, (which mo&s;t commonly center in commerce), being expended out of the coun|try,
<PB N="43" REF="031857_0040_0FEF2218E29057C8">
to which they properly belong; that a gradual poverty, and an accumulating mi&s;ery, are its never failing con&s;equence, as may be exemplified in the peo|ple of Scotland and Ireland, particularly the latter, where their wealth, being principally expended in England, in&s;tead of nouri&s;hing the &s;ources, from whence it is derived, has reduced the inhabitants to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of beggary and wretchedne&s;s. In proportion, therefore, as a country &s;uffers its com|merce to be carried on by foreigners, will its citizens become depre&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed. Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia, afford an additional ex|ample in point, where Engli&s;h and Scotch merchants and factors carry on the commerce, and retire to their native country, with the wealth which they thereby acquire, to the injury of tho&s;e &s;tates. To &s;uppo&s;e, then, that a di&s;tinction ought not to be made, between American merchants and tho&s;e of other countries; and that the di&s;abilities of foreign merchants ought not to be increa&s;ed in the United States, when &s;o many inconveniencies mu&s;t ari&s;e from the e&s;tabli&s;hing of a foreign influence, from the transferring the profits of commerce to a foreign country, and from withdraw|ing the credits and capitals from the country, at a time of exigence, or of war, when they may be mo&s;t needed, is, in every point of view, a pro&s;tration, both of national and commercial policy. For this purpo&s;e, additional and &s;pecial impediments &s;hould be thrown in the way of naturalizing merchant &s;trangers, in order to procure the preferences and advantages herein con|templated.

Lord Hawke&s;borough, in his di&s;cour&s;e with regard to neutral nations, calls Cromwell's act <Q>A NOBLE STRAIN OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, which hath proved the fertile &s;ource of all the naval pow|er, which hath operated in&s;en&s;ibly to the pre&s;erva|tion, and hath been the &s;pring from whence hath flowed, the wealth and greatne&s;s of England.</Q></P>
<P>How far <HI>this noble &s;train of commercial policy</HI> ought to be re&s;i&s;ted, or harmonized with; and whether, in the poetic language of the noble Lord, the United States ought to echo to the &s;ong, and in notes re&s;pon|&s;ive, bear up its lengthened &s;ound, let it be the ob|ject of the following ob&s;ervations to examine.</P>
<P>Admitting the advantages of navigation, and of a carrying trade, to be unque&s;tionable, as a mean of wealth and defence, which will &s;carcely be denied;&mdash; a commercial intercour&s;e ought equally, as has been already &s;ugge&s;ted, to reciprocate &s;uch advantages;&mdash; and the benefits received &s;hould equal tho&s;e which are be&s;towed: But the inquiry recurs, What is the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, as it re&s;pects the important &s;ubject in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? It is, in fact, that in the year end|ing the 1&s;t of October, 1790, the United States al|lowed to the ve&s;&s;els of Great-Britain, five times the direct freightage that they received; and of cour&s;e, our carrying trade contributed to the wealth and de|fence of Great-Britain in the proportion of four parts in five, at lea&s;t, of what it did to the advantage and benefit of the United States!!</P>
<P>The whole tonnage of ve&s;&s;els, on which duty was paid in the United States, in the aforementioned year, was 761,710 tons, of which there were belonging to the United States 492,100 tons, to other nations 269, 610 tons, of which Great-Britain had 226,953 tons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jeffer&s;on's &s;tatement to Congre&s;s in December, 1793.

<P>Ob&s;erve, that the above &s;tatement does not include the imports or ex|ports to and from the Briti&s;h colonies.</P>
<P>If the foregoing &s;tatements are founded upon facts; (for it is by facts and &s;tatements of this &s;ort that the commercial policy of a country mu&s;t be adjudged);&mdash; if they ju&s;tly point out the relative advantages, ari&s;|ing from the commerce and navigation of the two countries, can there be a doubt remaining, as to the ill policy of our exi&s;ting regulations of commerce?
<PB N="57" REF="031857_0054_0FEF2249B9AAF468">
and is it not obvious, that a balance of trade, &s;o im|men&s;e in its amount, and &s;o ruinous in its con&s;e|quences, threatning both public and private credit with &s;hipwreck, ought, by &s;ome means or other, to be remedied? and to what mea&s;ure, concurrent to tho&s;e already &s;ugge&s;ted, can we better recur, than to an American navigation act, &s;imilar to that of Great-Britain? It is a mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, of protection to our citizens, and of reciprocity to Great-Britain. Tench Coxe, in his view of the United States, ob&s;erves upon it, <Q>That the article of the Briti&s;h trade laws, which confines the importation of foreign goods to the bottoms of the country producing them, and of their own citizens, appears applicable to our &s;ituation. By means of tho&s;e two flags, we &s;hould be certain of the nece&s;&s;ary importa|tions; and we &s;hould throw out of each department of the carrying trade, every competitor, except the &s;hips of the nation by which the goods were pro|duced or manufactured. All trade with &s;everal countries, &s;uch as China and India, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;eldom or never make foreign voyages, would be &s;ecured in our own hands. It will be found, that a modified application of this regulation, in practice, will be attended with no difficulties or inconveni|ences; and be&s;ides the immediate benefits already mentioned, our merchants will be led <HI>directly</HI> to the <HI>original</HI> market for the &s;upplies of which we &s;tand in need. In&s;tead of purcha&s;ing goods of Ru&s;&s;ia, or the Ea&s;t-Indies, in England, France, or Holland, our own &s;hips will &s;ail directly to the fountain, from whence they have hitherto flowed to us through foreign channels. The credits given to us in Eu|rope, after the peace, kept us in the practice of go|ing to a very few places, for all our importations. But they have tru&s;ted us, in many in&s;tances, at a dear rate indeed; and however u&s;eful credit may be, as a &s;upplement to our means of trade, in this young country, it is very certain that we &s;hould

fir&s;t lay out to the be&s;t advantage, our funds in hand.</Q></P>
<P>Le&s;t it may be objected, that the reforms herein &s;ugge&s;ted, in the commercial &s;y&s;tem of the United States, might impugn the revenue, and thereby pro|duce mi&s;chief and di&s;order in the public finances;&mdash; but as this is neither intended, nor expected; and with a view to prevent &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion, as well as to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary amplification, it may not be improp|er to &s;ugge&s;t the following queries.</P>
<P>Query 1. Whether the revenue upon goods im|ported, ought to be calculated upon, beyond the value of the goods or produce exported?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether an increa&s;e of revenue, ari&s;ing from an undue importation in one year, mu&s;t not be fol|lowed by a reduced revenue in &s;ucceeding years; and if the exce&s;s be repeated, (the imports exceeding the exports), whether the revenue, grounded upon &s;uch importations, will not be &s;ubjected to a gradual reduc|tion, if not a final extinction?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether the amount of the importations would in fact be dimini&s;hed by particular prohibitions, tak|ing &s;everal years together; and whether the exclu|&s;ion of articles, unnece&s;&s;ary and luxurious, would not produce the &s;ame revenue, by the increa&s;e of &s;uch ar|ticles as were u&s;eful and convenient?</P>
<P N="4">4. And, la&s;tly, Whether a diminution in the re|venue from a partial exclu&s;ion of foreign tonnage, by an American navigation act, might not readily be in|demnified by an increa&s;ed duty upon the dome&s;tic?</P>
<P>Before the pre&s;ent &s;ubject is concluded, it may not be improper to make a few additional ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>An American navigation act, it is conceived, mu&s;t operate not le&s;s beneficially to the agricultural, than to the commercial &s;tates, by giving &s;ecurity to the tran&s;|portation of their produce to foreign markets at all times, and e&s;pecially in times of war; and &s;hould it be &s;ound, that the competition, in the &s;upply of ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould not at fir&s;t be &s;ufficient to furni&s;h the freight|age
<PB N="59" REF="031857_0056_0FEF224EEBEA66B0">
at the lowe&s;t rates, (which mu&s;t &s;oon be the ca&s;e,) the agricultural &s;tates, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, would be wanting in a ju&s;t view of their true intere&s;ts, not to co-operate in the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to produce it: In proof of which, it may be a&s;ked, what would have been the probable &s;ituation of the &s;outhern &s;tates, from the pre&s;ent European war, if the United States had been without navigation? Their produce mu&s;t, in all probability, have peri&s;hed upon their hands, or have been tran&s;ported to market at &s;o heavy an expen&s;e, as to have left little to the profit of their lands: whereas they have found immen&s;e prices for their productions, whil&s;t our &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els have had ample and gene|rous freights for their tran&s;portation. The union of the commercial and agricultural intere&s;t in this, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, has been found contributive to the general welfare; and perhaps no mea&s;ure of more ge|neral policy, or particular advantage, applying to the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates, could be readily devi&s;ed for the mutual benefit of agriculture and commerce, than an American navigation act, upon the principles herein propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But when we con&s;ider the encouragement of navi|gation as contributive to the general defence, without going far into the hi&s;tory of ancient or modern na|tions, there are few or no in&s;tances of a country hold|ing exten&s;ive colonies or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions abroad, or of en|joying power or re&s;pectability at home, or among the neighbouring &s;tates, without the aid of a maritime force. Navigation, as a nur&s;ery of &s;eamen, and as a mean of be&s;towing wealth and power, is found, by experience, to be among the fir&s;t objects of national policy. The Carthagenians maintained their indepen|dence, and were &s;ucce&s;sful rivals to the Roman power, as long as they pre&s;erved their naval &s;uperiority:&mdash; The mo&s;t brilliant achievements of the Athenians were through the means of their fleets:&mdash;<Q>The an&s;wer giv|en by the oracle of Delphi to the Athenians, to fortify their city with wooden walls again&s;t the inva&s;ion of
<PB N="60" REF="031857_0057_0FEF225537E7EF78">
Xerxes, is an advice which has been &s;ucce&s;sfully adopt|ed by the French and Engli&s;h,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;tlethwaite</NOTE></Q> and ought to be operative upon the citizens and government of the United States.</P>
<P>France, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of di&s;tant colonies, and by laying a duty, amounting to a prohibition, upon foreign &s;hipping, in the time of Lewis 14th, gained &s;uch an a&s;cendency upon the ocean, that her fleets be|came formidable to tho&s;e of England, Holland, and Spain: England, although always known as a mari|time power, yet from the time of King Edgar, to that of Queen Elizabeth, made no great figure upon the ocean:&mdash;Her colonies, principally Virginia, and after|wards the Carolinas, added to the wi&s;e provi&s;ions and prohibitions of her navigation acts, fir&s;t laid the foun|dation, and afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed her maritime im|portance.</P>
<P>To the policy of the&s;e acts ought the citizens of the United States to have recour&s;e, as a mean of pro|curing their country's pro&s;perity and power, as a mea&s;ure of &s;ecurity again&s;t foreign inva&s;ion;&mdash;to con|voy and to protect their commerce, to a&s;&s;ure to them the ju&s;t reward of their labour, and to protect it again&s;t foreign interference:&mdash;as a defen&s;ive mea&s;ure, to equalize the advantages of commerce with foreign nations; to place prohibitions again&s;t prohibitions, and generally to &s;ecure tho&s;e benefits, to which their &s;ituation, productions and good policy ought to en|title them.</P>
<P>To conclude:&mdash;Fellow-Citizens of the United States! let not <HI>"partial views, or local prejudices,"</HI> deter you from a due con&s;ideration of the mea&s;ures herein recommended: weigh well your commercial and political &s;ituation with Great-Britain! Let unity of action and de&s;ign (the chief characteri&s;tics of a na|tion) mark your mea&s;ures and councils!&mdash;Weak&mdash; timid&mdash;yielding politics never yet achieved any thing of importance!&mdash;It is for you to &s;ay, whether you
<PB N="61" REF="031857_0058_0FEF2256C0163398">
will be a great, independent, enterpri&s;ing and com|manding people;&mdash;or a weak&mdash;dependent&mdash;timid&mdash; and degraded one!&mdash;Speak the word, infu&s;e your influence into your government; and tho&s;e acts and mea&s;ures will &s;oon be pur&s;ued, which will not only &s;ecure you again&s;t the impending evils, which threat|en you, but will waft to your favoured &s;hores, pro|gre&s;&s;ive wealth, pro&s;perity, and power.</P>
