<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Relation might be acceptable to many of my Readers, being intended impartially as near the Truth as it hath come to my Knowledge. At <HI>Philadelphia</HI> on the third Day of the Second Month 1764. GEORGE the THIRD then happily Reigning. <HI>John Penn,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Tidings came from the <HI>North</HI> of a great Number of Men, who had a&s;&s;embled them|&s;elves in Arms, and were actually on their March for the &s;aid City, in order to take their Revenge on a Number of poor wretch|ed Savages, then in the Barracks of &s;aid City, under the Protection of the Govern|ment, however, ju&s;t their Cau&s;e might have been in Pointing out &s;uch of them as were actually Murderers (who would have been try'd by Law, and received their De&s;tiny) yet to fly in the Face of Government where|on very Individual and in &s;hort our All de|pends, mu&s;t be productive of very danger|ous and fatal Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>HWOBEIT, <HI>Philadelphia</HI> at this Time prov'd not to be the <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> expre&s;&s;es daily and
<PB N="4" REF="009697_0004_0F77860F1E628C98">hourly arriving of their nearer Approach, Orders were &s;ent to all the Ferrys on the River <HI>Schuylkil,</HI> to &s;top them by cutting away the Ropes and &s;inking their Boats, which greatly impeded their March, and about Four Hundred cro&s;s'd the River a|bout fourteen Miles <HI>North</HI> of the City at a Place call'd the <HI>Swedes Ford.</HI> Upon which being the Second Day of the Week, and the Sixth of the &s;ame Month, a Number of the Inhabitants of the City and others appeared under Arms, the Barracks and Streets lin'd with Cannon, and nothing was expected but the doleful Scene of War. Among the re&s;t were the People call'd Friends, prepared with Arms like <HI>Spartans</HI> brave, &s;triding forth with Gigantic Pace to defend their Laws and Liberty, more pre|cious than Life, let it be Recorded in the An|als of after Ages in LETTERS of GOLD.</P>
<P>ON the Seventh Day of the &s;ame Month an Expre&s;s arrives, informing that the Ad|vanced Guard, amounting to near two Hun|dred Men, had come into <HI>Germantown,</HI> whereon a Council was held, in which it was determined, that they &s;hould be met in Order to know their Demands, and why
<PB N="5" REF="009697_0005_0F77860FDFD4C5F0">they came Arm'd in &s;uch a Manner that they might drop their Intention by being in|formed of our Strength and Re&s;olution to Defend our Rights to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>HOWEVER on the eighth Day of the &s;ame they were vi&s;ited at <HI>Germantown;</HI> where|upon after &s;ome Communication with the Recorder and his A&s;&s;ociates; attended by a great Number of the Inhabitants, Gen|tlemen of the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they were found a &s;elected Band of Gentlemen, Decendants of the Noble <HI>Eniskillers,</HI> who were the great Means of &s;etting that great and never to be forgotten Prince King <HI>William</HI> on the Throne. Their Demands were too rea&s;on+able to be rejected, they were Gentle and ea&s;y, not farther then Pointing out to the Government &s;uch of the&s;e Savages as had been guilty of Murder, and a praying like|wi&s;e that the Government would take notice, and try them by the Laws of the Place ac|cordingly; they had no Intent in the lea&s;t to mole&s;t Man, Woman or Child. Their Grievance as it is &s;aid were yet &s;omewhat farther; they had paid for Lands, paid al&s;o their Taxes, &s;erv'd his Maje&s;ty, and all were in a Manner taken from them; indeed
<PB N="6" REF="009697_0006_0F778610A1C09060">&s;ome went &s;o far as to &s;ay, that it was given to Savage Indians, who were at this Time rioting in all the Plenty that &s;o great and Fertile a Province could afford; notwith|&s;tanding their Perfideous Outrages, on the Poor back Inhabitants, their Wives and de|fencele&s;s Children. Their Grievances by Information is at length to be laid before the Honourable Governor, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and undoubtedly from &s;o ju&s;t a Con&s;titution will receive the ju&s;t Merits of their Cau&s;e, which we hope in due Time will be made Manife&s;t and openly publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>THESE Things are the Effects of &s;uc|couring a Savage Nation, who Wolf-like for the&s;e many Years have been Murdering and De&s;troying Poor defencele&s;s People; and all they had thro' out our Frontiers, and when driven to Extremity for want of Cloathing or Victuals, they then propo&s;e a Treaty with our People, who generou&s;ly complies with almo&s;t every Things they &s;ay and want, then the next Step will be, give them &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Pounds in Cloa|thing, Arms, Ammunition, and in &s;hort every Thing they can &s;ay that they have
<PB N="7" REF="009697_0007_0F77861175C69A00">need of, and when the Renderzvous is over, and the Indians have well Eaten and Drank, they return to their own Country, killing whether Man or Bea&s;t they meet in their Way, this is the Retaliation the Government who mu&s;t pay all Sums thus expended get in return, &s;ome may &s;ay it's a nece&s;&s;ary Scourge for our Evil; others that it is not a Welcome One, and full of Ingratitude and Deceit.</P>
<P>MAY <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of all Nature direct us as Chri&s;tians to Humility, walk humbly before him, and to love our Neighbours as our&s;elves,</HI> and then undoubtedly will cea&s;e all this Tumultuous Factions: <HI>He will &s;ay to the Fomenting Sea, who&s;e Winds are Outrageous, be thou &s;till as the fine gliding Brook, who&s;e purling Streams are harmonious to the Hear|ers Ears, is the earne&s;t Prayer of your true and affectionate Lover of King and Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It would be well in this Critical juncture of Things, as the White People mo&s;t in General, hates any Thing that Sa|vours of the Name of an Indian; that they were remov'd to their own Country and there &s;et down in the mo&s;t Peaceable terms
<PB N="8" REF="009697_0008_0F778612273206F0">we could make with them, in hopes for the Future they wou'd re&s;t &s;atisfied, and in their Way, endeavour for an hone&s;t Living by Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Trade with us in my Opinion, for their Skins and Furrs, wou'd be valuable; and the Heart &s;cald that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among People; chiefly on their Account, wou'd weare away; on the other Hand if they &s;hould misbehave; there are Men enough here, and more will be very &s;oon here, and be able to follow them into their Towns, and undoubtedly take full Satisfaction, for any In&s;ults they dare com|mit. If we rightly inform'd, our Mother Country had always &s;ome Jealou&s;y of our behaviour one Day or other, and in this Situation of Things, there is a beginning made. SOLOMON &s;ays; <HI>A rod for the Fools hack,</HI> and we &s;hall have it, a &s;tanding Army to maintain.</P>
