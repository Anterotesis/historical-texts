<HEAD>Scriptural Cautions, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the earne&s;t reque&s;t of many &s;erious minded per&s;ons, I have undertaken to pre&s;ent to public view the nece&s;&s;ity of their receiving and maintain|ing evidences of a &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, by faith and love; accompanied with practical Godline&s;s,</P>
<P>And, From a di&s;covery of the deplorable &s;tate of the inhabitants of our land, appearing awfully &s;unk down and involved in &s;in and di&s;obedience again&s;t God, and the &s;trong delu&s;ions pointed out in the &s;criptures, &s;preading among&s;t the people; and from &s;orrowful experience of the baneful effects of my own family's being infatuated with this new, fal&s;e and &s;trange religion; which is attended with all deceiv|ablene&s;s.</P>
<P>In deep humiliation I would adverti&s;e all people, that are de&s;irous of the knowledge of the truth, that they may be &s;aved from the&s;e impending delu&s;ions; with &s;criptural cautions, again&s;t giving their at|tention to fal&s;e Chri&s;ts and fal&s;e Prophets; there|fore attend to the words of wi&s;dom, from the wi&s;e King of I&s;rael, again&s;t giving attention to, or fol|lowing after the &s;trange WOMAN, or her Pro&s;olites: Who flatter with their lips, Proverbs vii. 5, and at times is loud and &s;tubborn; her feet abideth not in her hou&s;e; therefore let not your hearts in|cline to her ways: Go not a&s;tray in her paths for &s;he hath ca&s;t down many, wounded, yea her hou&s;e is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death, Proverbs vii. 11, 25, 26, 27. She having &s;eparated from, and left her own hu&s;band, as I am in|formed, contrary to divine authority, Matt. xix. 5, 6. I. Cor. vii. 2, 3, 4, 5. She and her adherents teach others to do the &s;ame, through which means in&s;tead
<PB N="4" REF="018310_0003_0FA5C8D81A8DF558">of being a crown, to their hu&s;bands, they become as rottenne&s;s in his bones; Proverbs xii. 4. She &s;elleth families through her witchcrafts. Mal. iii. 4. for they become tributary to her, as well as in|volved in Satan's &s;nare.&mdash;It may be ob&s;erved that this &s;cheme is carried on and &s;upported with all de|ceivablene&s;s. II. The&s;&s;. ii. 10. She is &s;ubtil of heart and their ways are movable, they may at fir&s;t appear with many good words and fair &s;peeches to deceive the hearts of the &s;imple, repeating tho&s;e miracles they have power to do. Rev. xii. 14. And there was un|clean &s;pirits to come out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet working miracles. Rev. xvi. 13, 14. They often change from this &s;cheme of flattery and appear in a very great fury calling it the anger of God, a|gain&s;t &s;in, telling per&s;ons they are going right to hell, except they come into relation with that body of Europeans they &s;tile the CHURCH, and &s;ubjected in perfect obedience to them;&mdash;hence they wear the rough garment to deceive, as in Zach. xii. 4. If it be one that is per&s;uaded of a &s;aving intere&s;t in God's &s;alvation, through faith in the blood and right teou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; they will very artfully labour to draw a vail between him and all his former views of re|demption by the virtue of Chri&s;t's blood; and tell them it will all avail them nothing, but he is the far|ther lo&s;t from God for what he has heretofore experi|enced of light, comfort and con&s;olation; therefore there is no way to e&s;cape hell, but to lay open all the &s;ecret &s;ins of his pa&s;t life to them for they &s;ay God cannot be found any where el&s;e but in that body they belong to; therefore it appears that it is a &s;trange God they wor&s;hip, as well as a &s;trange Woman they follow; I am per&s;uaded it is not the God of the whole univer&s;e for he fills heaven and earth, therefore in him we live move and have our being; &s;ince there|fore they give their adorations to &s;uch a &s;trange Deity, and adore a poor old Woman as the head and &s;ource of their influences; we may ob&s;erve they have &s;trange laws, which run counter to the laws and
<PB N="5" REF="018310_0004_0FA5C8D9E502A3D0">commands of the true God of I&s;rael; they urge that for men and their own wives to dwell together according to knowledge in the u&s;e of means for multiplication according to God's appointment, is a damning &s;in; therefore the man and his wife mu&s;t part a&s;under in that re&s;pect and not &s;o much as lodge in one bed to|gether;&mdash;but the God that made them at the be|ginning made them male and female, and tempered them together; commanding them to be fruitful and multiply, annexing his ble&s;&s;ing to them, Gen. i. 28. God &s;aw fit to make the woman, a help meat for the man, being bone of his bone and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, Gen. ii. 23. Again, we may ob&s;erve God e|&s;tabli&s;hed his covenant with Noah; after he came out of the ark, when the old world was drowned, and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply, and bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein, Gen. ix. 7, 8 Moreover the &s;uper&s;titious Phari&s;ees came to our Saviour tempting him with this que&s;tion; whether or no it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cau&s;e; ob&s;erve the an|&s;wer of that divine per&s;on by whom we were at fir&s;t formed and who &s;pake us into being; he an&s;wered the &s;uper&s;titious Phari&s;ees &amp; &s;aid unto them; have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and &s;aid for this cau&s;e, &s;hall a man leave father and mother and &s;hall cleave to his wife, and they twain &s;hall be one fle&s;h; where|fore they are no more twain but one fle&s;h; what therefore God has joined together let no man put a|&s;under;&mdash;and tells them, &s;ome for the hardne&s;s of their hearts were &s;uffered to put away their wives, but it was not &s;o from the beginning, and he plainly tells them the con&s;equences of &s;uch procedings is to become adulterers, Matt. ix. 3,&mdash;10, therefore Paul willeth that the young women marry, bear children, guide their hou&s;e, and give no occa&s;ion to their ad|ver&s;ary to &s;peak reproachfully; hence it is that mar|riage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
<PB N="6" REF="018310_0005_0FA5C8DA4A95E278">I. Tim. v. 14. Heb. xiii. 4. Therefore it plainly ap|pears from divine authority that the laws and rules coming forth from the &s;trange Woman and her pro|&s;olites, does not corre&s;pond with, but runs counter to the laws and in&s;titutions of the God of the true I&s;rael, under both law and go&s;pel: To blind peo|ples eyes they urge they mu&s;t not indulge any of the works of the fle&s;h; now the apostle tells us the works of the fle&s;h are manife&s;t, which are the&s;e adultry, fornication, idolatry, witchcraft, &amp;c. with many other wicked practices. But in the catalogue of the works of the fle&s;h he does not once call in que&s;tion; men's and women's labouring with their hands in a lawful way, for the things needful to their bodies nor partaking of tho&s;e things for their nouri&s;hment and comfort, if it be received with thank&s;giving to the author of their benefits. Neither does the in&s;pired apo&s;tle once mention men and their own wives dwel|ling together according to knowledge, or lodging in one bed together, to be the works of the fle&s;h; but the apo&s;tle de&s;cribes the works of the fle&s;h, Gal. v. 19, 20. Furthermore in this &s;trange religion is found the generations that Solomon &s;peaks of in Prov. xxx. 11. 12, that cur&s;es their father and does not ble&s;s their mother, and are pure in their own eyes, and never have been wa&s;hed from their filthine&s;s; if any &s;hould deny this a&s;&s;ertion, it is too obvious from their own conduct to be denied, which may be prov|ed by good authority; what heavier cur&s;es can a child denounce again&s;t his parents than to call them devils and tell them they will wake in hell? yet the&s;e poor deluded creatures boa&s;t of their holi|ne&s;s, as though none could convince them of &s;in; it further appears they are not wa&s;hed from their filthi|ne&s;s, from their own te&s;timony, di&s;owning any being born again but tho&s;e Europeans, which they call the church; yet they will impo&s;e upon the public, pre|tending to teach them the way to heaven, and the things of the kingdom. And yet our Saviour te&s;tifi|ed to Nicodemus, except a man be born again he
<PB N="7" REF="018310_0006_0FA5C8DAEB2BD588">cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God; con&s;equently they are &s;trangers to the things of that kingdom, for if they are not born of God, they are of their father the devil. John, viii. 44. Therefore we may not think it &s;trange if they cla&s;h in the face of God's authority, even to cur&s;ing father and mother, and parting a&s;under hu&s;|band and wife; for Chri&s;t tells them the works of their father they will do, for he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth; they al&s;o countenance and indulge hu&s;bands leaving their own wives, and children, and depriving them of his intere&s;t or labour for their maintainance or &s;upport, unle&s;s they will imbrace with them this &s;trange re|ligion that is attended with &s;o many glairing ab&s;urdi|ties. Wives di&s;own all natural affections to their hu&s;bands and children. Thus women become mon&s;ters, and men wor&s;e than infidels in this new and &s;trange religion: but when we con&s;ider from whence the&s;e new laws and rules originate, and who &s;tands at the head of their di&s;cipline, the wonder may a|bate in &s;ome degree, for God placed the man next to him&s;elf in the creation, between the woman and him|&s;elf, and enjoined the womans obedience to the man, and &s;aid the man &s;hould rule over her, Gen. iii. 16. And Paul being in&s;pired by the &s;ame &s;pirit, &s;aith, let the women learn in &s;ilence with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but &s;uffer not a woman to teach, nor to u&s;urp autho|rity over the man, but to be in &s;ilence, for Adam was fir&s;t formed, then Eve. I. Tim. ii. 11, 12, 13. But in this new religion, the men hold them&s;elves in in|tire &s;ubjection to the woman, and &s;he has the rule o|ver the men to that degree, that it appears to be the common opinion of her adherents and their foremo&s;t leaders, the olde&s;t of which &s;tands in more awe and fear of her than children do of their parents.</P>
<P>Under the lead and influence of this government, &s;ome being operated upon with &s;trange per&s;uations, that it is the works of God, acknowledge them&s;elves filled with bla&s;phemous thoughts again&s;t the God of heaven; and at times are under temptations to mur|der
<PB N="8" REF="018310_0007_0FA5C8DE7545D910">them&s;elves, and yet are hurried to go forth with the re&s;t of their company, in their dance as though they were all filled with frolicking devils. Sometimes they will appear with a &s;trange ri&s;ing &s;huddering, and trembling, as though the hatchways of the bot|tomle&s;s pit were bur&s;ted open, and the infernal &s;pirits had broke in among them; therefore they have ma|ny kinds of charms to affright, or to allure. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it may not be thought &s;trange, if one &s;hould conclude their was &s;orcery and witch|craft in the cau&s;e, &s;ince they obey not the truth, Gal. iii. 1. They boa&s;t much of their &s;igns and wonders, but I have not found them exalted above what we read of them in the II. The&s;&s;. ii. 3,&mdash;10. And we may &s;ee it is above all that is called God, and with all powers and &s;igns, and lying wonders. Now the &s;pirit &s;peaketh expre&s;ly, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, givine heed to &s;educing &s;pirits and doctring of devils, &s;peaking lies in hypocri&s;y, having their con&s;ciences &s;eared with a hot iron, forbiding to marry, and commanding to ab|&s;tain from meats which God has created to be receiv|ed with thank&s;giving. I. Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Furthermore, They urge that a new di&s;pen&s;ation has taken place, and that Chri&s;t has come the &s;econd time, which they pretend to prove by counting the mi&s;tical numbers &s;pecified in the prophe&s;ies of Daniel, as well as by their &s;igns and wonders. But our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t adverti&s;es us of the&s;e great &s;igns and wonders taking place before his coming; which if it were po&s;&s;ible would deceive the very elect. Matt. xxiv. 24. The&s;e things indicate that the time draws nigh and is even at the doors; but it has plea&s;ed God in his wi&s;dom to re&s;erve the fore&s;ight and knowledge of that time to him&s;elf, and not reveal it to men nor angels beforehand; but it &s;hall come &s;udden, to the great &s;urpri&s;e of Chri&s;t's rejectors and go&s;pel di&s;pi&s;ers; for it &s;hall come like a thief in the night, on a &s;udden as the lightening breaketh forth out of the ea&s;t and &s;hineth unto the we&s;t, for the Lord &s;hall de&s;cend from
<PB N="9" REF="018310_0008_0FA5C8DFE9601250">heaven with a &s;hout, &amp;c. Matt. xxiv. 27, 43, I. The&s;&s;. iv. 16, &amp;c. Therefore let all per&s;ons that are infatuated with apprehen&s;ions of its being a new di&s;pen&s;ation, and &s;o conclude it may admit of new laws or a new go&s;pel, be alarmed from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>When God had given forth the divine law under the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, he forbid adding thereto or dimini&s;hing therefrom. Deut. xii 32. And at the clo&s;e of the divine records, the Lord tells us, that he that &s;hall add to the things of the prophe&s;ies of the book, God &s;hall add to him all the plagues that are written in the book; and if any man &s;hall take away from the words of this prophecy, God &s;hall take away his part out of the book of life. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. Therefore &s;aith Paul, Though we, or an angel from heaven preach any other go&s;pel unto you, then that we have preached unto you, let him be accur&s;ed. Gal. i. 8. O then let us all turn our attention from the voice of fal&s;e prophets and the influence of &s;eucing &s;pirits, and carefully attend to God's word, by which we are to try the &s;pirits.&mdash;If there ari&s;e among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a &s;ign or a wonder, and the &s;ign comes to pa&s;s, whereof he &s;pake unto thee, &s;aying, Let us go after other Gods, which thou ha&s;t not known, and let us &s;erve them; thou &s;halt not harken to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with your heart and with all your &s;oul; ye &s;hall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye &s;hall &s;erve him and cleave unto him, and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams &s;hall be put to death, becau&s;e he hath &s;poken to turn you away from the Lord your God. Deut. xiii. 1&mdash;5. Now let it excite every one that has named the name of Chri&s;t, to prayer and watchfulne&s;s, and that they depart from all iniquity; while we look into this meluncholly
<PB N="10" REF="018310_0009_0FA5C8E1A697DA30">&s;cene of &s;ome departing from the faith, and forget|ing they were purged from their old &s;ins, and have be|come pu&s;&s;ed up and vain in their imaginations, having their under&s;tandings darkened, being alien|ated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts. Eph. iv. 18. And being de&s;titute of the principles and powers of &s;piritual life and void of natural affec|tations. What mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of &s;eeking to witches, wizards, charmers and tho&s;e that have fami|liar &s;pirits, and for children to cur&s;e their parents, hu&s;bands and wives to part a&s;under and become adulterers, leaving their poor children de&s;titute of any &s;upport, and renouncing all natural affections for each other and their offspring, and &s;peaking bla&s;|phemies again&s;t God, and &s;ometimes are under &s;trong temptations to murder them&s;elves, and yet &s;eem to be fully per&s;uaded they are in the work of God.</P>
<P>And now in order to be deterred from, and guarded again&s;t tho&s;e horrid ab&s;urdities, let us all be allarmed from mount Ebal, &amp; con&s;ider the cannons of God's word are loaded with heavy cur&s;es that are pointed again&s;t &s;uch wicked conduct, and will be di&s;charged like &s;o many blazeing thunder-bolts from the artillery of heaven, in one eternal &s;torm again&s;t all &s;uch mi&s;erable offenders, unle&s;s timely repentance through the ten|der mercy and long forbearance of God, through the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t interpo&s;e for their relief; for it will not avail for any to plead that tho&s;e things were but the effects of their &s;trong zeal; it was a very great zeal no doubt in them that cau&s;ed their children to pa&s;s through the fire to Moloch; They built the high places of Baal, to burn their &s;ons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which the Lord &s;ays I commanded not, nor &s;pake it, neither came it into my mind. Jer. xix. 5.</P>
<P>From hence we learn the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping clo&s;e to the &s;acred wor of God as the man of our coun&s;el;
<PB N="11" REF="018310_0010_0FA5C8E1CD97EF48">for it is not only fle&s;h and blood that we have to con|tend with in the cau&s;e, but principalities and powers and &s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places; wherefore we need to take the whole armour of God, that we may be able to with&s;tand temptations in this evil day; let us &s;tand therefore having on the brea&s;t|plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, above all, taking the &s;hield of &s;aith, wherewith we may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; and take the helmet of &s;alvation and &s;word of the &s;pirit which is the word of God, praying with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance. Eph. vi. 11&mdash;18. Therefore let every &s;oul be careful to lay a&s;ide all carnal weapons in this ca&s;e, and u&s;e none but them that are mighty through God to the pulling down the &s;trong hold of &s;in either in our&s;elves or others, and ca&s;ting down imaginations and every thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t God, and let every thought be brought into captivity to the obedience of Chri&s;t, and let us ever look to the Captain of our &s;alvation by faith and prayer, le&s;t while we are watching the motions of the enemy on one hand, we are caught in his &s;nare on the other, and it being but fleeing from the bear for the lion to meet us.</P>
<P>With &s;orrow and grief I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have been much captivated with, and deeply involved in this new and &s;trange &s;cheme, to the admiration of many of my former acquaintances, and was extremely zealous, being per&s;uaded, it was the only way to perfection out of all &s;in; but alas, the great decep|tion is this, to be ever going on in a way that never comes to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P>For the con&s;ideration of inquiring minds, I &s;hall mention a few things which were conducive to my falling in with this deceiving &s;cheme; the con&s;ider|ation of which is to be lamented. Not only &s;eeing the encouragible, impenitent, and open profane, ea|gerly pur&s;uing every method by which they might
<PB N="12" REF="018310_0011_0FA5C8E290FD3670">expre&s;s their ab&s;olute contempt both of the autho|rity and goodne&s;s of God, (which &s;hould have led them to repentance) as though the flood-gates of &s;in and abomination were hoi&s;ted, and each one was &s;triving to be formo&s;t in the horrid &s;tream lead|ing down to the black regions of the burning main.</P>
<P>And the profe&s;&s;ing people of our land, who &s;tile them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, who ought to have kept the fea&s;t with the unlevened bread of &s;incerity, or ra|ther been mourning for the abominations of our land in deep humiliation before God.</P>
<P>But the dark a&s;pects that appear from their com|mon conduct, &s;eem to denote a woful declen&s;ion from go&s;pel &s;implicity, and true faith is &s;carcely to be found on earth among&s;t all its profe&s;&s;ors, who appear with the mark of infidelity, coveteou&s;ne&s;s, pride and wantonne&s;s abounding, at a very enormous height, through which means civil religion appears to be &s;tiffled, and almo&s;t fetched its la&s;t ga&s;ps in our pro|fe&s;&s;ing land. The con&s;ideration of the&s;e things gave me much exerci&s;e for the want of charity; when there was any &s;ubjected to the cro&s;s, or had vital union with Chri&s;t, or walked humbly with God.</P>
<P>And my mind not being fruitful in the con&s;ider|ation, that at &s;uch a juncture the man of &s;in or &s;on of perdition would exalt him&s;elf and a&s;cend his reign with the miftry of inquity, &s;preading it&s;elf with all deceivablene&s;s.</P>
<P>I therefore having the oppertunity of an interview with tho&s;e people, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> me, that a new di&s;per&s;ation had taken place; and they appearing with their fine-&s;pue dre&s;s of perfection&mdash;with the appearance or things &s;upernatural, and with many good words, drew my attention to their inchanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, by which means I &s;oon became prejudiced in their favour, and &s;ubjected to their lead and go|vernment,
<PB N="13" REF="018310_0012_0FA5C8E40DA2B130">expecting to find them the people they profe&s;s to be.</P>
<P>But alas, I found my&s;elf awfully deceived, being landed upon a papi&s;t &s;y&s;tem attended with its own &s;pirit, and pregnant with its corrupt principles, vending it&s;elf with the attempts of tyranny: as the young a&s;p may act out all the po&s;tures of the old one, before it has power to bite.</P>
<P>Furthermore, When I came to hear fal&s;e te&s;timo|nies, to my certain knowledge, come forth from tho&s;e that call them&s;elves perfect, as well as from their pro&s;olites; under the&s;e operations and influences de|ceived by them, which has not only been productive to break the mo&s;t tendere&s;t ties of nature between a man and his wife, but the horrid &s;in of adultry is carried on among&s;t tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious perifectioners, that pretend, that it is a damning &s;in for a man and his own wife to dwell together according to know|ledge in the natural u&s;e of each other.</P>
<P>But &s;ince their &s;cheme is carried on, and with all deceivablene&s;s, the circum&s;tances of deception are mani&s;old.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting their dancing, the general repre&s;enta|tion they give of it, is, that it is the token of great joy and happine&s;s of the new Jeru&s;alem &s;tate, and denotes the victory over &s;in; a great deception lies in the&s;e pretentions; for a&s;k tho&s;e dancers, whether they are born again, and they will &s;ay no. Be&s;ides this, the orders from their church, are to labour in their dance to maortify the lufts of the fle&s;h. Hence they u&s;e the&s;e expre&s;&s;ion in their dance: Labour, labour, mortification before redemption! Thus it evidently appears, that in order to be born again, they mu&s;t ware out their con&s;titutions, and reduce their natures &s;o low, as not to have any of the common &s;eelings of mankind, and by this they are to judge of their be|ing born again; O mi&s;erable Jeru&s;alem &s;tate.</P>

About two years ago, they held up to view, and was often heard to &s;ay, if they per&s;evered in their di&s;|pen&s;ation, they &s;hould never die a natural death; but after they began to die and numbers had died among them, they grew a&s;hamed of their doctrine of immor|tality, and began to deny that they ever held to any &s;uch thing; thus they are known to &s;hi&s;t and change, to &s;ay and un&s;ay, to carry and end their &s;cheme.</P>
<P>As to their doctrine, it is well known to all who are acquainted with the &s;everal branches of it, and are al&s;o acquainted with the doctrine of the church of Rome, that there is no e&s;&s;ential difference; their doctrine of per&s;ection, celibacy or ab&s;tainance, the doctrine of purgatory or pri&s;on &s;tate, the doctrine of church oracles, the doctrine of church power to open and &s;hut heaven to acquit and damn &s;ouls, is all Ro|mi&s;h doctrine; thus it is very ea&s;y to &s;ee who the&s;e people are, and to what body or church they belong; and if it was written of the church of Rome, Mi&s;tery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abomi|nations of the earth; &s;o may it be written of this people, Mi&s;tery, Rome the mother of witchcra&s;ts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved that the exact re&s;emblance of this people appeared in England in the year 1706 and 1707, brought in by two or three French pro|phets (&s;o called,) who went on with their prophe&s;ies, &s;hakeings, unknown tongues, &amp;c. which prevailed for a time, and took in many into the delu&s;ive &s;cheme, but finally worked it&s;elf out and died in &s;hame and contempt.</P>
<P>Since therefore we are all expo&s;ed and liable to be taken in the &s;nares of Satan, let it exite one all to &s;anctify the Lord God in their hearts, and let him be our fear and our dread, &s;ince the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to depart from the &s;nares of death. For he &s;pake thus to me with a &s;trong hand, and in|structed
<PB N="15" REF="018310_0014_0FA5C8E58FAA4100">me that I &s;hould not walk in the way of this people. Saying, Say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people &s;hall &s;ay a confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid; &s;anctify the Lord of ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And when they &s;hall &s;ay unto you, &s;eek unto them that have famliar &s;pirits, and unto wizards that peep, and mutter: &s;hould not a people &s;eek unto their God: for the living, to the dead? TO the law and to the te&s;timony: if they &s;peak not ac|cording to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them. I&s;aiah, viii. II&mdash;13, 19, 20.</P>
