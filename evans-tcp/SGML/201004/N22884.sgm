<P>THIS day the Congre&s;s met, and, a quorum being formed, it was agreed, on the 6th, to inform the Pre&s;ident that the two Hou&s;es were ready to receive &s;uch communications as he might have to make to them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pre&s;ident went to the Repre&s;entatives' chamber, in the u&s;ual manner, where, the two Hou&s;es being a&s;&s;embled, he delivered the follow|ing addre&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN recurring to the internal &s;ituation of our country &s;ince I had la&s;t the plea&s;ure to addre&s;s you, I find ample rea&s;on for a renewed expre&s;&s;ion of that gratitude to the
<PB N="6" REF="030227_0005_0FE54BB4A4062718">
Ruler of the Univer&s;e, which a continued &s;eries of pro&s;|perity has &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly called forth.</P>
<P>The acts of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, which required &s;pecial ar|rangements, have been, as far as circum&s;tances would ad|mit, carried into operation.</P>
<P>Mea&s;ures calculated to en&s;ure a continuance of the friend&s;hip of the Indians, and to pre&s;erve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been dige&s;ted and adopted. In the framing of the&s;e, care has been taken to guard on the one hand, our advanced &s;ettlements from the predatory incur&s;ions of tho&s;e unruly individuals, who cannot be re&s;trained by their tribes; and on the other hand, to protect the rights &s;ecured to the Indians by trea|ty; to draw them nearer to the civilized &s;tate; and in|&s;pire them with correct conceptions of the power, as well as ju&s;tice of the government.</P>
<P>The meeting of the deputies from the Creek nation at Coleraine, in the State of Georgia, which had for a princi|pal object the purcha&s;e of a parcel of their land by that State, broke up without its being accompli&s;hed; the na|tion having, previous to their departure, in&s;tructed them again&s;t making any &s;ale; the occa&s;ion however has been improved, to confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks, their pre-exi&s;ting engagements with the United States; and to obtain their con&s;ent to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of trading hou&s;es, and military po&s;ts within their boundary; by means of which their friend&s;hip and the general peace may be more effectually &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The period during the late &s;e&s;&s;ion, at which the appro|priation was pa&s;&s;ed, for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Maje&s;ty, nece&s;&s;arily procra&s;tinated the reception of the po&s;ts &s;tipulated to be delivered, be|yond the date a&s;&s;igned for that event.</P>
<P>As &s;oon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addre&s;&s;ed with propriety on the &s;ubject, arrange|ments were cordially and promptly concluded for their
<PB N="7" REF="030227_0006_0FE54BB631A6B950">
evacuation, and the United States took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principal of them, comprehending O&s;wego, Niagara, De|troit, Michilimackinac and Fort Miami, where &s;uch re|pairs and additions have been ordered to be made as ap|peared indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain, to determine which is the ri|ver St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Ben&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of New-York, for the third commi&s;&s;ioner. The whole met at St. Andrew's, in Pa&s;&s;amaquody Bay, in the beginning of Oc|tober, and directed &s;urveys to be made of the rivers in di&s;|pute; but deeming it impracticable to have the&s;e &s;urveys completed before the next year, they adjourned, to meet at Bo&s;ton in Augu&s;t 1797, for the final deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Other commi&s;&s;ioners appointed on the part of the Unit|ed States, agreeably to the &s;eventh article of the treaty with Great-Britain, relative to captures and condemna|tion of ve&s;&s;els and other property, met the commi&s;&s;ioners of his Britannic maje&s;ty in London, in Augu&s;t la&s;t, when John Trumbull, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was cho&s;en by lot, for the fifth com|mi&s;&s;ioner. In October following, the board were to pro|ceed to bu&s;ine&s;s. As yet, there has been no communica|tion of commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of Great-Britain, to unite with tho&s;e who have been appointed on the part of the United States, for carrying into effect the &s;ixth article of the treaty.</P>
<P>The treaty with Spain required that the commi&s;&s;ioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States, and his Catholic Maje&s;ty's provinces of Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida, &s;hould meet at the Natchez before the expiration of &s;ixth months after the exchange of the rati|fications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the twenty-fifth day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Maje&s;|ty, occupying any po&s;ts within the limits of the United States, were within the &s;ame period to be withdrawn.&mdash; The commi&s;&s;ioner of the United States, therefore, com|menced his journey for the Natchez in September, and
<PB N="8" REF="030227_0007_0FE54BBA09D891A0">
troops were ordered to occupy the po&s;ts from which the Spani&s;h garri&s;ons &s;hould be withdrawn. Information has been recently received of the appointment of a commi&s;|&s;ioner on the part of his Catholic Maje&s;ty, for running the boundary line; but none of any appointment for the ad|ju&s;tment of the claims of our citizens, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els were captured by the armed ve&s;&s;els of Spain.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the act of Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;|&s;ion, for the protection and relief of American &s;eamen, agents were appointed, one to re&s;ide in Great Britain, and the other in the We&s;t-Indies. The effects of the agency in the We&s;t-Indies are not yet fully a&s;certained; but tho&s;e which have been communicated afford grounds to believe the mea&s;ure will be beneficial. The agent de&s;|tined to re&s;ide in Great-Britain declining to accept the appointment, the bu&s;ine&s;s has con&s;equently devolved on the mini&s;ter of the United States, in London, and will com|mand his attention, until a new agent &s;hall be appointed.</P>
<P>After many delays and di&s;appointments ari&s;ing out of the European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Al|giers, will, in all pre&s;ent appearance, be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; but under great, though inevitable di&s;advantages in the pecuniary tran&s;actions, occa&s;ioned by that war&punc; which will render a further provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary. The actual liberation of all our citizens who were pri&s;oners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is it&s;elf an earne&s;t of a &s;atisfactory termination of the whole ne|gociation. Mea&s;ures are in operation for effecting trea|ties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.</P>
<P>To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval force is indi&s;pen&s;able. This is manife&s;t with regard to wars in which a &s;tate is it&s;elf a party. But be&s;ides this, it is in our own experience, that the mo&s;t &s;incere neutrality is not a &s;ufficient guard again&s;t the depredations of nations at war. To &s;ecure re&s;pect to a neutral flag, requires a naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from in|&s;ult or aggre&s;&s;ion. This may even prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of going to war, by di&s;couraging belligerent powers from
<PB N="9" REF="030227_0008_0FE54BBCD7479458">
committing &s;uch violations of the rights of the neutral party, as may, fir&s;t or la&s;t, leave no other option. From the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, it would &s;eem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a pro|tecting force, will always be in&s;ecure; and our citizens expo&s;ed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but ju&s;t been relieved.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations invite the United States to look to the means, and to &s;et about the gradual creation of a navy. The increa&s;ing progre&s;s of their navigation pro|mi&s;es them, at no di&s;tant period, the requi&s;ite &s;upply of &s;eamen; and their means, in other re&s;pects, favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement likewi&s;e, that their particular &s;ituation will give weight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands. Will it not then be advi&s;able to begin without delay to provide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of &s;hips of war; and to proceed in the work by degrees, in propor|tion as our re&s;ources &s;hall render it practicable without inconvenience; &s;o that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in the &s;ame unprotected &s;tate in which it was found by the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>Congre&s;s have repeatedly, and not without &s;ucce&s;s, di|rected their attention to the encouragement of manufac|tures. The object is of too much con&s;equence not to en|&s;ure a continuance of their efforts in every way which &s;hall appear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on public account are inexpedient. But where the &s;tate of things in a country leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture will for a great length of time obtain; when the&s;e are of a nature e&s;&s;ential to the fur|ni&s;hing and equipping of the public force in time of war; are not e&s;tabli&s;hments for procuring them on public ac|count, <HI>to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public &s;ervice,</HI> recommended by &s;trong con&s;iderations of national policy, as an exception to the general rule? Ought our country to remain in &s;uch ca&s;es dependent on foreign &s;up|ply, precarious, becau&s;e liable to be interrupted?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030227_0009_0FE54BBE65450FB8">If the nece&s;&s;ary articles &s;hould in this mode co&s;t more in time of peace, will not the &s;ecurity and independence thence ari&s;ing, form an ample compen&s;ation? E&s;tabli&s;h|ments of this &s;ort, commen&s;urate only with the calls of the public &s;ervice in time of peace, will, in time of war&punc; ea&s;ily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the govern|ment; and may even perhaps be made to yield a &s;urplus for the &s;upply of our citizens at large, &s;o as to mitigate the privations from the interruptions of their trade. If adopt|ed, the plan ought to exclude all tho&s;e branches which are already, or likely &s;oon to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the country; in order that there may be no danger of interference with pur&s;uits of individual indu&s;try.</P>
<P>It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance in popula|tion, and other circum&s;tances of maturity, this truth be|comes more apparent; and renders the cultivation of the &s;oil more and more an object of public patronage. In&s;titu|tions for promoting it, grow up &s;upported by the public pur&s;e: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater &s;ucce&s;s, than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Boards, compo&s;ed of proper cha|racters, charged with collecting and diffu&s;ing information, and enabled, by premiums and &s;mall pecuniary aids, to en|courage and a&s;&s;i&s;t a &s;pirit of di&s;covery and improvement.&mdash; This &s;pecies of e&s;tabli&s;hment contributes doubly to the in|crea&s;e of improvement; by &s;timulating to enterprize and experiment; and by drawing to a common centre the re|&s;ults every where of individual &s;kill and ob&s;ervation, and &s;preading them thence over the whole nation. Experi|ence accordingly has &s;hewn, that they are very cheap in|&s;truments of immen&s;e national benefits.</P>
<P>I have heretofore propo&s;ed to the con&s;ideration of Con|gre&s;s, the expediency of e&s;tabli&s;hing a National Univer&s;i|ty; and al&s;o a Military Academy. The de&s;irablene&s;s of both the&s;e in&s;titutions, has &s;o con&s;tantly increa&s;ed with every new view I have taken of the &s;ubject, that I cannot
<PB N="11" REF="030227_0010_0FE54BC08964A9C0">
omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your atten|tion to them.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly to which I addre&s;s my&s;elf, is too enlight|ened not to be fully &s;en&s;ible how much a flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the arts and &s;ciences contributes to national pro&s;perity and reputation. True it is, that our country, much to its honor, contains many &s;eminaries of learning highly re&s;pec|table and u&s;eful; but the funds upon which they re&s;t, are too narrow to command the able&s;t profe&s;&s;ors in the diffe|rent departments of liberal knowledge, for the in&s;titution contemplated: though they would be excellent auxiliaries.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the motives to &s;uch an in&s;titution, the a&s;&s;imila|tion of the principles, opinions and manners of our coun|trymen, by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter, well de&s;erves attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in the&s;e particulars, the greater will be our pro&s;pect of permanent union; and a primary object of &s;uch a national in&s;titution &s;hould be, the education of our youth in the &s;cience of <HI>government.</HI> In a republic, what &s;pecies of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more pre&s;&s;ing on its legi&s;la|ture, than to patroni&s;e a plan for communicating it to tho&s;e who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of a military academy, is al&s;o recom|mended by cogent rea&s;ons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate &s;tock of military knowledge for emergencies. The fir&s;t would impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its &s;afety, or expo&s;e it to greater evils when war could not be avoided. Be&s;ides, that war might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the ob&s;ervance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the nece&s;&s;ity of practi&s;ing the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in pre&s;erving and tran&s;mitting by proper e&s;tabli&s;hments, the knowledge of that art. What|ever argument may be drawn from particular examples, &s;uperficially viewed, a thorough examination of the &s;ub|ject will evince, that the art of war is at once comprehen|&s;ive
<PB N="12" REF="030227_0011_0FE54BC648FCE358">
and complicated; that it demands much previous &s;tudy; and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in its mo&s;t improved and perfect &s;tate, is always of great moment to the &s;ecurity of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a &s;erious care of every government; and for this purpo&s;e, an academy, where a regular cour&s;e of in&s;truction is given, is an ob|vious expedient, which different nations have &s;ucce&s;sfully employed.</P>
<P>The compen&s;ations to the officers of the United States, in various in&s;tances, and in none more than in re&s;pect to the mo&s;t important &s;tations, appear to call for legi&s;lative revi&s;ion. The con&s;equences of a defective provi&s;ion are of &s;erious import to the government. If private wealth is to &s;upply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly contract the &s;phere within which the &s;election of character for office is to be made; and will proportionally dimini&s;h the probability of a choice of men, able as well as upright. Be&s;ides that it would be repugnant to the vital principles of our government, virtually to exclude from public tru&s;ts, talents and virtue, unle&s;s accompanied by wealth.</P>
<P>While in our external relations, &s;ome &s;erious inconve|niencies and embarra&s;&s;ments have been overcome, and others le&s;&s;ened, it is with much pain, and deep regret, I mention, that circum&s;tances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has &s;uffered, and is &s;uf|fering exten&s;ive injuries in the We&s;t-Indies, from the cruizers and agents of the French republic; and communi|cations have been received from its mini&s;ter here, which indicate the danger of a further di&s;turbance of our com|merce by its authority; and which are, in other re&s;pects, far from agreeable.</P>
<P>It has been my con&s;tant, &s;incere and earne&s;t wi&s;h, in conformity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly under&s;tanding with that republic. This wi&s;h remains unabated; and I &s;hall per|&s;evere in the endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmo&s;t extent of what &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t, and indi&s;pen&s;able regard to the rights and honour of our country: nor will I ea&s;ily cea&s;e to cheri&s;h the expectation, that a &s;pirit of ju&s;|tice,
<PB N="13" REF="030227_0012_0FE54BC7D7649620">
candor and friend&s;hip, on the part of the republic, will eventually en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing this cour&s;e, however, I cannot forget what is due to the character of our government and nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good &s;en&s;e, patrioti&s;m, &s;elf-re&s;pect and fortitude of my countrymen.</P>
<P>I re&s;erve for a &s;pecial me&s;&s;age, a more particular com|munication on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>I have directed an e&s;timate of the appropriations nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, to be &s;ubmitted from the proper department; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to the late&s;t period to which an account can be prepared.</P>
<P>It is with &s;atisfaction I am able to inform you, that the revenues of the United States continue in a &s;tate of pro|gre&s;&s;ive improvement.</P>
<P>A reinforcement of the exi&s;ting provi&s;ions for di&s;charg|ing our public debt, was mentioned in my addre&s;s at the opening of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. Some preliminary &s;teps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, en|gage your zealous attention during the pre&s;ent. I will only add, that it will afford me a heartfelt &s;atisfaction to concur in &s;uch further mea&s;ures, as will a&s;certain to our country the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy extingui&s;hment of the debt. Po&s;terity may have cau&s;e to regret, if from any mo|tive, intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for acce|lerating this valuable end.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Senate and of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>My &s;olicitude to &s;ee the militia of the United States placed on an efficient e&s;tabli&s;hment, has been &s;o often, and &s;o ardently expre&s;&s;ed, that I &s;hall but barely recall the &s;ub|ject to your view on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; at the &s;ame time that I &s;hall &s;ubmit to your inquiry, whether our har|bours are yet &s;ufficiently &s;ecured.</P>
<P><PB REF="030227_0013_0FE54BC9654CC078">The &s;ituation in which I now &s;tand, for the la&s;t time, in the mid&s;t of the repre&s;entatives of the people of the U|nited States, naturally recalls the period when the admi|ni&s;tration of the pre&s;ent form of government commenced: and I cannot omit the occa&s;ion to congratulate you, and my country, on the &s;ucce&s;s of the experiment; nor to re|peat my &s;upplication to the Supreme Ruler of the uni|ver&s;e, and Sovereign Arbiter of nations, that his provi|dential care may &s;till be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happine&s;s of the people may be pre|&s;erved; and that the government, which they have in&s;ti|tuted for the protection of their liberties, may be perpe|tual.</P>

<HEAD>12th DECEMBER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Senate pre&s;ented to the Pre&s;ident the fol|lowing an&s;wer to his addre&s;s of the 7th.</HEAD>
<P>WE thank you, Sir, for your faithful and detailed ex|po&s;ure of the exi&s;ting &s;ituation of our country: and we &s;incerely join in &s;entiments of gratitude to an over-ruling Providence, for the di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;hare of public pro&s;peri|ty, and private happine&s;s, which the people of the United States &s;o peculiarly enjoy.</P>
<P>We are fully &s;en&s;ible of the advantages that have re|&s;ulted from the adoption of mea&s;ures (which you have &s;ucce&s;sfully carried into effect) to pre&s;erve peace, cultivate friend&s;hip, and promote civilization, among the Indian tribes, on the we&s;tern frontiers;&mdash;feelings of humanity, and the mo&s;t &s;olid political principles, equally encourage the continuance of this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that the delivery of the mi|litary po&s;ts, lately occupied by the Briti&s;h forces, within the territory of the United States, was made with cordi|ality, and promptitude, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances would ad|mit; and that the other provi&s;ions of our treaties with Great-Britain and Spain, that were objects of eventual
<PB N="15" REF="030227_0014_0FE54BCB876F2708">
arrangement, are about being carried into effect, with en|tire harmony and good faith.</P>
<P>The unfortunate, but unavoidable difficulties that op|po&s;ed a timely compliance with the terms of the Algerine treaty, are much to be lamented; as they may occa&s;ion a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the advantages to be derived from a &s;olid peace with that power, and a perfect &s;ecurity from its predatory warfare; at the &s;ame time, the lively impre&s;&s;ions that affected the public mind, on the redemp|tion of our captive fellow-citizens, afford the mo&s;t laudable incentive to our exertions, to remove the remaining ob&s;ta|cles.</P>
<P>We perfectly coincide with you in opinion that the im|portance of our commerce demands a naval force for its protection again&s;t foreign in&s;ult and depredation, and our &s;olicitude to attain that object will be always proportionate to its magnitude.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of accelerating the e&s;tabli&s;hment of cer|tain u&s;eful manufactures, by the intervention of legi&s;lative aid and protection, and the encouragement due to agricul|ture, by the creation of Boards, (compo&s;ed of intelligent individuals) to patronize this primary pur&s;uit of &s;ociety, are &s;ubjects which will readily engage our mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention.</P>
<P>A national univer&s;ity may be converted to the mo&s;t u&s;eful purpo&s;es&mdash;the &s;cience of legi&s;lation, being &s;o e&s;&s;enti|ally dependent on the endowments of the mind, the public intere&s;t mu&s;t receive effectual aid from the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge; and the United States will a&s;&s;une a more dignified &s;tation, among the nations of the earth, by the &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation of the higher branches of literature.</P>
<P>A military academy may be likewi&s;e rendered equally important. To aid and direct the phy&s;ical force of the na|tion, by cheri&s;hhing a military &s;pirit, enforcing a proper &s;en&s;e of di&s;cipline, and inculcating a &s;cientific &s;y&s;tem of tactics, is con&s;onant to the &s;ounde&s;t maxims of public poli|cy: connected with, and &s;upported by &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
<PB N="16" REF="030227_0015_0FE54BD1C82AD5E8">
a well regulated militia, con&s;tituting the national defence of the country, would prove the mo&s;t effectual, as well as economical, pre&s;ervative of peace.</P>
<P>We cannot but con&s;ider, with &s;erious apprehen&s;ions, the inadequate compen&s;ations of public officers, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e in the more important &s;tations. It is not only a violation of the &s;pirit of a public contract, but is an evil &s;o exten&s;ive in its operation, and &s;o de&s;tructive in its con&s;e|quences, that we tru&s;t it will receive the mo&s;t pointed le|gi&s;lative attention.</P>
<P>We &s;incerely lament, that whil&s;t the conduct of the United States has been uniformly impre&s;&s;ed with the cha|racter of equity, moderation, and love of peace, in the maintainance of all their foreign relation&s;hips, our trade &s;hould be &s;o harra&s;&s;ed by the crui&s;ers and agents of the republic of France, throughout the exten&s;ive departments of the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we are confident that no cau&s;e of complaint ex|i&s;ts, that could authori&s;e an interruption of our tranquilli|ty, or di&s;engage that republic from the bonds of amity, cemented by the faith of treaties, we cannot but expre&s;s our deepe&s;t regrets, that official communications have been made to you, indicating a more &s;erious di&s;turbance of our commerce. Although we cheri&s;h the expectation, that a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, and a con&s;ideration of our mutual inte||re&s;ts will moderate their councils; we are not unmindful of the &s;ituation in which events may place us, nor unpre|pared to adopt that &s;y&s;tem of conduct, which, compatible with the dignity of a re&s;pectable nation, nece&s;&s;ity may com|pel us to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>We cordially acquie&s;ce in the reflection, that the Uni|ted States, under the operation of the federal govern|ment, have experienced a mo&s;t rapid aggrandizement and pro&s;perity, as well political, as commercial.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t contemplating the cau&s;es that produce this au&s;|picious re&s;ult, we much acknowledge the excellence of the con&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem, and the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lative

It is, therefore, with the &s;incere&s;t regret, that we now receive an official notification of your intentions to retire from the public employments of your country.</P>
<P>When we review the various &s;cenes of your public life, &s;o long and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully devoted to the mo&s;t arduous &s;ervices, civil and military,&mdash;as well during the &s;truggles of the American revolution, as the convul&s;ive periods of a recent date, we cannot look forward to your retirement, without our warme&s;t affections and mo&s;t anxious regards accompanying you; and without mingling with our fel|low citizens at large, the &s;incere&s;t wi&s;hes for your per&s;onal happine&s;s, that &s;en&s;ibility and attachment can expre&s;s.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="answer">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have attended to your communication re&s;pecting the &s;tate of our country, with all the &s;en&s;ibility that the contemplation of the &s;ubject, and a &s;en&s;e of duty can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>We are gratified by the information, that mea&s;ures cal|culated to en&s;ure a continuance of the friend&s;hip of the Indians, and to maintain the tranquillity of the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> frontier, have been adopted; and we indulge the hope
<PB N="18" REF="030227_0017_0FE54BD523D67BF8">
that the&s;e, by impre&s;&s;ing the Indian tribes with more cor|rect conceptions of the ju&s;tice, as well as power of the U|nited States, will be attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>While we notice, with &s;atisfaction, the &s;teps that you have taken in pur&s;uance of the late treaties with &s;everal foreign nations, the liberation of our citizens, who were pri&s;oners at Algiers, is a &s;ubject of peculiar felicitation. We &s;hall cheerfully co-operate in any further mea&s;ures that &s;hall appear, on con&s;ideration, to be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>We have ever concurred with you in the mo&s;t &s;incere and uniform di&s;po&s;ition to pre&s;erve our neutral relations inviolate, and it is, of cour&s;e, with anxiety and deep re|gret we hear that any interruption of our harmony with the French Republic has occurred: for we feel with you and with our con&s;tituents, the cordial and unabated wi&s;h to maintain a perfectly friendly under&s;tanding with that nation. Your endeavours to fulfil that wi&s;h, and by all honourable means to pre&s;erve peace and to re&s;tore that harmony and affection which have heretofore &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the French Republic and the United States, cannot fail, therefore, to intere&s;t our attention. And while we participate in the full reliance you have expre&s;&s;ed on the patrioti&s;m, &s;elf-re&s;pect and fortitude of our countrymen, we cheri&s;h the plea&s;ing hope, that a mu|tual &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and moderation will en&s;ure the &s;uc|ce&s;s of your per&s;everance.</P>
<P>The various &s;ubjects of your communication will, re&s;|pectively, meet with the attention that is due to their im|portance.</P>
<P>When we advert to the internal &s;ituation of the United States, we deem it equally natural and becoming to com|pare the pre&s;ent period with that immediately antecedent to the operation of the government, and to contra&s;t it with the calamities in which the &s;tate of war &s;till involves &s;eve|ral of the European nations, as the reflections deduced from both tend to ju&s;tify as well as to excite, a warmer admiration of our free con&s;titution, and to exalt our minds to a more fervent and grateful &s;en&s;e of piety towards Al|mighty
<PB N="19" REF="030227_0018_0FE54BD756587D50">
God for the beneficence of his providence, by which its admini&s;tration has been hitherto &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>And while we entertain a grateful conviction that your wi&s;e, firm and patriotic admini&s;tration has been &s;ignally conducive to the &s;ucce&s;s of the pre&s;ent form of govern|ment, we cannot forbear to expre&s;s the deep &s;en&s;ations of regret with which we contemplate your intended retire|ment from office.</P>
<P>As no other &s;uitable occa&s;ion may occur, we cannot &s;uf|fer the pre&s;ent to pa&s;s without attempting to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome of the emotions which it cannot fail to awaken.</P>
<P>The gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are &s;till drawn to the recollection of tho&s;e re&s;plendent virtues and talents which were &s;o eminently in&s;trumental to the atchievement of the revolution, and of which that glori|ous event will ever be the memorial. Your obedience to the voice of duty and your country, when you quitted re|luctantly, a &s;econd time, the retreat you had cho&s;en, and fir&s;t accepted the pre&s;idency, afforded a new proof of the devotedne&s;s of your zeal in its &s;ervice, and an earne&s;t of the patrioti&s;m and &s;ucce&s;s which have characterized your admini&s;tration. As the grateful confidence of the citizens in the virtues of their chief magi&s;trate, has e&s;&s;entially con|tributed to that &s;ucce&s;s, we per&s;uade our&s;elves that the millions whom we repre&s;ent, participate with us in the anxious &s;olicitudes of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet we cannot be unmindful that your moderation and magnanimity, twice di&s;played by retiring from your ex|alted &s;tations, afford examples no le&s;s rare and in&s;tructive to mankind, than valuable to a republic.</P>
<P>Although we are &s;en&s;ible that this event, of it&s;elf, com|pletes the lu&s;tre of a character already con&s;picuou&s;ly unri|valled by the coincidence of virtue, talents, &s;ucce&s;s and public e&s;timation; yet we conceive we owe it to you, Sir, and &s;till more emphatically to our&s;elves and to our nation, (of the language of who&s;e hearts we pre&s;ume to think

our&s;elves at this moment the faithful interpreters) to ex|pre&s;s the &s;entiments with which it is contemplated.</P>
<P>The &s;pectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering by its repre&s;entatives the tribute of unfeigned approbation to its fir&s;t citizen, however novel and intere&s;ting it may be, derives all its lu&s;tre (a lu&s;tre which accident or enthu&s;i|a&s;m could not be&s;tow, and which adulation would tarni&s;h) from the tran&s;cendent merit of which it is the voluntary te&s;timony.</P>
<P>May you long enjoy that liberty which is &s;o dear to you, and to which your name will ever be &s;o dear: May your own virtues and a nation's prayers obtain the hap|pie&s;t &s;un-&s;hine for the decline of your days and the choice&s;t of future ble&s;&s;ings. For our country's &s;ake, for the &s;ake of republican liberty, it is our earne&s;t wi&s;h that your ex|ample may be the guide of your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and thus, after being the ornament and &s;afeguard of the pre&s;ent age, be|come the patrimony of our de&s;cendants.</P>

<P>This an&s;wer, on which there was a pretty long and warm debate, is &s;omewhat different from that which was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by the committee ap|pointed to draw it up. Some members were op|po&s;ed to almo&s;t every part of it, but their oppo&s;i|tion was more directly levelled again&s;t three par|ticular points; the compliment to the Pre&s;ident, the paragraph re&s;pecting the mi&s;under&s;tanding with the French Republic, and the expre&s;&s;ion of the free and enlightened &s;tate of the American peo|ple.</P>
<P>That a compliment to the Pre&s;ident, or rather a faint acknowledgement of his virtues and &s;er|vices (for on this &s;ubject any acknowledgement mu&s;t be faint,) &s;hould be oppo&s;ed in the Congre&s;s of the United States, would be cau&s;e of great mor|tification to every generous and grateful mind,
<PB N="21" REF="030227_0020_0FE54BDE398C44F0">
were it not accompanied with the con&s;oling reflec|tion, that <HI>Mr. Giles</HI> was at the head of the oppo|&s;ition. There are certain per&s;ons, who&s;e applau&s;e we &s;hun with as much &s;olicitude as we &s;eek for that of others, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there are few men in the world who&s;e prai&s;es I &s;hould dread more than tho&s;e of the Virginian Giles, and I dare &s;ay the Pre&s;ident is very happy to think that he has e&s;caped them.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer expre&s;&s;es a grateful conviction of the Pre&s;ident's <HI>wi&s;e, firm,</HI> and <HI>patriotic</HI> admini|&s;tration, and regrets his departure from office. To all this the virtuous and upright Mr. Giles objected. He &s;aid, that
<Q>the Pre&s;ident's admini|&s;tration had been neither <HI>wi&s;e</HI> nor <HI>firm;</HI> and as to his departure from office, he felt not the lea&s;t regret on account of it. He hoped he would retire to his country &s;eat, and live comfortably there. He believed the government of the United States would go on without him. <HI>The people</HI> were competent to their <HI>own</HI> government. That for tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed &s;ome of the principal mea&s;ures of the Pre&s;ident, to vote for the an&s;wer in its pre&s;ent form, would be <HI>writing &s;coundrel on their foreheads.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It would be u&s;ele&s;s to take up mine and my read|er's time in a ju&s;tification of the compliment to which Mr. Giles was oppo&s;ed. The people of the United States, from one end of the Union to the other, have unequivocally expre&s;&s;ed, what this gentleman is afraid to expre&s;s, le&s;t thereby he &s;hould write &s;coundrel on his forehead. If the reader will look back to the Cen&s;or for April la&s;t, he will find this &s;ame patriot declaring, that he <HI>adored</HI> the voice of the people, and yet he has
<PB N="22" REF="030227_0021_0FE54BDFCE9BDA58">
now the temerity to doubt its infallibility, to re|fu&s;e obedience to it, even to mutiny again&s;t and offer re&s;i&s;tance to its <HI>awful</HI> commands. If ever I derived an extraordinary degree of &s;atisfaction from the embarra&s;&s;ment of others, it was on &s;eeing Mr. Giles and his brother patriots, the votaries of the popular voice, reduced to take the <HI>unpopular</HI> &s;ide of a que&s;tion. The leader &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of the awkwardne&s;s of his &s;ituation, when he &s;aid that
<Q><HI>the people</HI> are competent to their <HI>own</HI> government.</Q>
This was a kind of palliative, it was &s;hifting the ground of oppo&s;ition, it was a poor mi&s;erable attempt to pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency, and betrayed either a total want of di&s;cernment in the &s;peaker, or a con&s;ummate contempt for the under&s;tandings of the people: for, if the people are competent to their own government, they are certainly competent to form a judgment of the conduct of the Pre&s;ident, and as they have declar|ed his admini&s;tration to be wi&s;e, firm and patrio|tic, how dared their zealous and pious adorer to &s;ay they are mi&s;taken?</P>
<P>As to <HI>writing &s;coundrel on his front,</HI> of which Mr. Giles &s;eemed to entertain &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary fears, if the approving of the compliment in que&s;|tion would produce this effect, all the members of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, and nine-tenths of their con&s;tituents, had already taken the hideous in|&s;cription. What a &s;coundrelly god, then, does Mr. Giles adore? If an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition to all the mo&s;t important mea&s;ures of an admini&s;tra|tion, which the an&s;wer approves of in the aggre|gate, was calculated to imprint the terrific word, voting for the an&s;wer could do no more than ren|der legible what was already written; as charac|ters in certain liquids remain imperceptible till
<PB N="23" REF="030227_0022_0FE54BE2021883A8">
drawn forth by the fire. Mr. Giles and his fel|low labourers prudently &s;hrank from the ordeal; but they will excu&s;e us, if our imaginations &s;hould &s;upply its place. Read we a&s;&s;uredly &s;hall, and it will be nothing very extraordinary if we &s;hould extend the &s;ignification of every term that we think we perceive.</P>
<P>The next &s;ubject of oppo&s;ition was the para|graph which &s;peaks of the mi&s;under&s;tanding with the bloody Gallican Republic. In the reported an&s;wer it &s;tood thus:
<Q>We have ever concurred with you in the mo&s;t &s;incere and uniform di&s;|po&s;ition to pre&s;erve our mutual relations invio|late, and it is, of cour&s;e, with anxiety and deep regret we hear that any interruption of our har|mony with the French Republic has occurred: for we feel with you, and with our con&s;tituents, the cordial and unabated wi&s;h, to maintain a perfectly friendly under&s;tanding with that na|tion. Your endeavours to fulfil that wi&s;h can|not fail therefore to intere&s;t our attention. And while we participate in the full reliance you have expre&s;&s;ed on the patrioti&s;m, &s;elf-re&s;pect and fortitude of our countrymen, we cheri&s;h the plea&s;ing hope, that a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and moderation will en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of your per|&s;everance.</Q></P>
<P>This was certainly tame enough, after all the outrages and in&s;ults of France. The de&s;ire to re-e&s;tabli&s;h harmony is expre&s;&s;ed, as <HI>Mr. Ames</HI> ob|&s;erved, with little le&s;s ardour than the reque&s;ts of a &s;upplicating lover; and the confidence in the &s;pirit of the country, in ca&s;e of an appeal to arms, is di&s;gui&s;ed with as much care, as if it were a crime to be courageous in oppo&s;ing the violence and re|&s;enting
<PB N="24" REF="030227_0023_0FE54BE8A1116888">
the indignities of a horde of ba&s;e-born grovelling tyrants.</P>
<P>How different from this he&s;itating tone was that of the Senate: "We are," &s;ay they,
<Q>not un|mindful of the &s;ituation in which events may place us, <HI>nor unprepared to adopt that &s;y&s;tem of conduct, which, compatible with the dignity of a re|&s;pectable nation, nece&s;&s;ity may compel us to pur&s;ue.</HI></Q>
This manly an&s;wer does infinite honour to the man who penned it, and let the in&s;olent convention re|collect, that it was approved of by him with whom they will in future be obliged to treat.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of the Senate was all that could be wi&s;hed, but it &s;hould have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in warmth by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the <HI>immedi|ate</HI> repre&s;entatives of the people. Language that may be extremely proper, at &s;uch a cri&s;is, from cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Senators, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is rather to check than to encourage the ardour of the public &s;pirit, may be poor and cold when coming from the Repre&s;entatives. Every &s;entence from them &s;hould have &s;moked with indignation at the in&s;upportable in&s;olence of the French; they &s;hould have declared, that they were ready with their lives to defend that independence, which had been &s;o openly attacked, and to &s;upport the government in every energetic mea&s;ure it &s;hould take to obtain &s;atisfaction for the indigni|ties that had been heaped on it. Yet, &s;o far from this was the conduct of the Hou&s;e, that even the paragraph above quoted was not humble enough for them: not content with expre&s;&s;ing their <HI>anxi|ety</HI> and <HI>deep regret</HI> at the interruption of <HI>harmony,</HI> and their <HI>unabated</HI> wi&s;h to maintain a <HI>perfectly friendly</HI> under&s;tanding, with the nation who had
<PB N="25" REF="030227_0024_0FE54BEA48627430">
robbed, de&s;pi&s;ed, and openly in&s;ulted them and their country, they mu&s;t needs add another &s;en|tence, wi&s;hing for the re&s;toration of that <HI>harmony</HI> and <HI>affection,</HI> which had hitherto &s;o <HI>happily</HI> &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted. Not content with amplifying their tremu|lous accents till the quaver had lo&s;t the &s;ound of manhood, they mu&s;t needs begin <HI>da Capo</HI> and re|peat the faltering tune. Nay, the la&s;t &s;entence of the paragraph, which &s;peaks of a &s;pirit of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>moderation,</HI> could not pa&s;s without being crammed with the word <HI>mutual.</HI> Mr. Giles, in|deed, wi&s;hed to tack another phra&s;e; viz. <HI>"on the part of the Republic,"</HI> to the end of this word <HI>mu|tual.</HI> He &s;eemed to think that the an&s;wer would be incomplete without a little <HI>nonsense.&mdash;</HI><Q>That a <HI>mutual</HI> &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and moderation <HI>on the part of the Republic</HI> will en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of your per&s;everance.</Q>&mdash;If you can go to the Sun|day-Schools round the city, and find me a boy out of his primer, &s;tupid and illiterate enough to compo&s;e a &s;entence like this, I will be bound to find you men in Virginia, who &s;hall vote him into Congre&s;s.&mdash; "<HI>The</HI> Republic," too. <HI>What</HI> Repub|lic? Is not America a Republic as well as France? The French King forbade his &s;ubjects to addre&s;s him, or &s;peak of him, under any other name than &s;imply that of <HI>the</HI> King, as if there were but one king in the world; ju&s;t as we &s;peak of the Sun or the Moon. The de&s;pots who have cut his throat, &s;eem to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his vanity as well as of his hou&s;es, his gardens, his coaches and his jewels. They call their poor beggared en&s;laved country <HI>the</HI> Republic. But other kingdoms ne|ver ob&s;erved this &s;tyle of eminence towards the French monarch, nor will it be ob&s;erved towards the French Republic, I tru&s;t, by any other Re|public, or any other mortal except Mr. Giles. It
<PB N="26" REF="030227_0025_0FE54BEBD7EC34E0">
would &s;eem that the gentleman forgot where he was, and looked upon him&s;elf as a repre&s;entative of the &s;warthy French, in&s;tead of the more hu|mane and more enlightened, though &s;ooty, citi|zens of the ancient dominion.</P>
<P>The imagination of this man, and of all tho&s;e who voted with him, appears to have been upon the rack to find out terms expre&s;&s;ive of their de|pendence on the genero&s;ity and magnanimity of the in&s;ulting foe, and of their want of confidence in the people of this country. Was this what the Pre&s;ident expected, when he complained to them of the aggre&s;&s;ions of the French, and of the threats he had received from their mini&s;ter? Was this what the people expected, when that in&s;olent mini&s;ter appealed to them from their govern|ment? No; they expected no &s;uch milk-&s;op tau|tology. They expected a good, plain, and re|&s;olute tone, calculated to convince the treache|rous French, that their independence was not a mere name, and that, while a de&s;ire of peace dwelt in their brea&s;ts, fear of a war found no place there.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the introduc|tion of that redundancy of <HI>affection,</HI> which now di&s;honours the an&s;wer, that the fir&s;t draught was dictated by a &s;pirit of accommodation; and, in|deed, this was evidently the ca&s;e, for no one who knows Me&s;&s;rs. Ames and Sitgreaves, and reads their animated &s;peeches in the debate, will be|lieve that this draught was dictated by their feel|ings. My complai&s;ance, however, would not have carried me &s;o far; I would have &s;tood alone in the Hou&s;e; I would have oppo&s;ed every &s;en|tence, every word, and every &s;yllable, that &s;a|voured
<PB N="27" REF="030227_0026_0FE54BEDF03B9860">
of tamene&s;s, that indicated a reliance on the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>moderation</HI> of the French, or a fear of encountering their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The third &s;ubject of oppo&s;ition was, that &s;en|tence in the an&s;wer which &s;tyles the people of America
<Q>the free&s;t and mo&s;t enlightened in the world;</Q>
and who could help being &s;urpri&s;ed that the <HI>adorer</HI> of the <HI>people</HI> &s;hould take the lead here al&s;o! One would imagine, that to be proper ob|jects of adoration, they &s;hould at lea&s;t be the mo&s;t free and enlightened in the world; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. Giles adored them for their purity and virtue, which there is very little rea&s;on to do.</P>
<P>The&s;e words were at la&s;t changed for,
<Q>a free and enlightened people.</Q>
The cau&s;e of this (with &s;hame be it &s;poken) was, <HI>fear of offending the French Convention,</HI> an a&s;&s;embly that every worthy American longs to &s;pit upon; an a&s;&s;em|bly who&s;e approbation is a mark of di&s;honour ten thou&s;and times greater than &s;tanding in the pillory or being burnt in the hand. Talk of writing &s;coundrel in the forehead! I would &s;ooner bear the word &s;coundrel as a motto round the pupils of my eyes, than be bla&s;ted with the approving grin of a gang of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</P>
<P>That the cau&s;e of the oppo&s;ition was what I have &s;tated it, mu&s;t be clear to every one who recollects the language of the members who took a part in it, on other occa&s;ions. There is hardly a people in Europe, except the French, whom they have not, at different times, &s;ince the pre|&s;ent war, repre&s;ented as buried in &s;lavery and brutal ignorance. They in&s;i&s;ted that the Hou&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="030227_0027_0FE54BF0C5E6D958">
had no right to ca&s;t reflections on foreign nations; what right had Mr. Giles, then, to ca&s;t reflections on the government and parliament of Britain? What right had another member to call the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia a &s;he-bear, another, the King of Great Bri|tain a robber, and another, all kings in general a herd of crowned mon&s;ters? "The fact may be true," &s;aid they,
<Q>but we have no right to &s;tep beyond the boundaries of our own country to contra&s;t it with any other.</Q>
Now, what did the pretty Mr. Living&s;ton, who was one of the&s;e inoffen&s;ive and mode&s;t gentlemen, do la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion.?&mdash;<Q>Great Britain, was <HI>once</HI> free; but now Great Britain, and <HI>all Europe,</HI> France <HI>except|ed,</HI> is <HI>in chains!</HI></Q>&mdash;Was this &s;tepping beyond the boundary line? This was not being content with eulogium on America, but was openly in|&s;ulting every nation of Europe, <HI>except the French,</HI> the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened</HI> heroes of the <HI>Bloody Buoy.</HI> But, why need we go back to pa&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, when in the pre&s;ent one, and even in this debate, and on this very que&s;tion, we hear the delicate Mr. Parker exclaim:
<Q>Kingcraft and prie&s;tcraft have too long governed the world with an iron rod: more enlightened times, I tru&s;t, are approach|ing, and I hope ere long <HI>republicani&s;m</HI> will cover the earth.</Q>&mdash;Like the univer&s;al deluge I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is pretty clear from this &s;ally of Mr. Parker, that no nations were to be excepted but tho&s;e who are, or call them&s;elves, republics. This might have done very well, and the an&s;wer might have been thus amended with &s;ome little con&s;i&s;tency, but poor Mr. Parker has a &s;hort memory, and being pre&s;&s;ed hard by Mr. William Smith, who truly a&s;&s;erted that fear of giving umbrage to the
<PB N="29" REF="030227_0028_0FE54BF44F5E9200">
French, was at the bottom of the oppo&s;ition, he tacked &s;hort about, and ran headlong into the mo&s;t mon&s;trous contradiction that ever bemired a poor orator.&mdash;"No;" &s;aid he,
<Q>I have not the French republic, or any other nation in view; the Swi&s;s Cantons have &s;hown them&s;elves more enlightened than we.</Q>&mdash;All was well yet, but Mr. Parker, like mo&s;t other eloquent men, is very fond of enumeration, and he unfortunately added the <HI>Danes</HI> and the <HI>Swedes.</HI> The&s;e nations al&s;o, he &s;aid, were more enlightened than the people of America, though, in the &s;ame &s;peech, he declared that <HI>King-craft</HI> had too long govern|ed the world with an iron rod, and hoped that more enlightened times were at hand, and that republicani&s;m would &s;oon cover the earth! He could not be &s;o very ignorant, or at lea&s;t I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;o, as not to know that Denmark and Sweden are governed by kings; but he was hem|med up in a corner, and did not know where to look for more enlightened republics than his own, <HI>except France.</HI>&mdash;A legi&s;lator &s;hould always un|der&s;tand geography and a&s;tronomy, and then "his eye in a fine fit of frenzy rolling," might, as Doctor Ruth &s;ays Rittenhou&s;e did, find out re|publics in the moon. However, a very little &s;tudy of the former &s;cience, might have led Mr. Parker, in his jump from Switzerland to Den|mark, to perceive the dear &s;i&s;ter republic of <HI>Ba|tavia.</HI> Here he might have found a triumphant compari&s;on. Republicani&s;m has enlightened the Dutch with a vengeance. The &s;ans-culottes have worn them down till you may read a new&s;paper through their ribs. <HI>Geneva</HI> too, which was &s;o near him when he was got among the Swi&s;s, might, one would have thought, have claimed a
<PB N="30" REF="030227_0029_0FE54BF5DD674090">
preference to Denmark and Sweden; particularly as the cheering rays of republicani&s;m have been communicated to it by the great luminary which &s;eems to be the &s;ole object of his admiration.</P>
<P>Mr. Parker moved for &s;triking out the words, "free&s;t and mo&s;t enlightened." This Mr. Chri&s;|tie propo&s;ed to amend, by in&s;erting,
<Q>free-e&s;t, and <HI>amongst</HI> the mo&s;t enlightened;</Q>
but &s;till Mr. Swanwick thought the word <HI>"amongst"</HI> &s;hould come before, in&s;tead of after
<Q><HI>free-e&s;t;</HI> becau&s;e nothing could tend more to <HI>pre&s;erve the peace</HI> of the country, than <HI>treating others with re|&s;pect;</HI></Q>
and in this opinion he was joined by Me&s;&s;rs. Coit and Dayton, the latter of whom mo&s;t humbly thought, that
<Q>the amendment very much <HI>&s;oftened</HI> the terms, and rendered them <HI>more palatable.</HI></Q>&mdash;At la&s;t, after the&s;e four words had undergone ju&s;t as many changes as can be rung upon four bells, the peal was clo&s;ed with, "<HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened</HI> people."</P>
<P>Gracious heaven! and have I lived to hear the American Congre&s;s, men who&s;e brow I had been taught to believe <HI>independence</HI> had made its cho&s;en &s;eat, haggling three whole days about four words of compliment to their country, and at la&s;t ex|punge them, le&s;t they &s;hould give offence to a foreign nation! Mr. Living&s;ton and the news-monger Brown may dun us as long as they plea&s;e about the &s;lavery of Britons, but if a member of their Hou&s;e of Commons were timid enough to expre&s;s his <HI>&s;ears</HI> at calling his nation the free-e&s;t and mo&s;t enlightened in the world, I flatter my|&s;elf he would never dare &s;how his face again in that a&s;&s;embly. For a nation, which dares not pa&s;s on it&s;elf whatever compliment or encomium
<PB N="31" REF="030227_0030_0FE54BF810D5B140">
it plea&s;es, to call it&s;elf <HI>free</HI> and <HI>independent,</HI> is an abu&s;e of words that nothing can be a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for, except the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of be|ing, and of being thought, exactly the contrary of what it &s;trives to appear.</P>
<P>That the amendment &s;hould be adopted at all, is a circum&s;tance in it&s;elf &s;ufficiently humiliating; but, when we con&s;ider that it was adopted for fear of giving umbrage to France; when we con&s;ider that the repre&s;entatives of the people thought it unfitting to declare them more <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlighten|ed</HI> than the ba&s;e, the willing &s;laves, the bruti&s;hly ignorant and illiterate wretches left in the French territory, we feel our &s;uperiority in&s;ulted, and de&s;pi&s;e the man who would &s;hrink from the de|claration.</P>
<P>In that <HI>free</HI> country, France, the parent dares not yield protection to his child, nor the child to his parent, without the previous con&s;ent of &s;ome petty under&s;trapping de&s;pot. Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no|thing; his property belongs to a mob of tyrants, who call them&s;elves the nation, who hold his la|bour and his very carca&s;s in a &s;tate of requi&s;ition. If his griefs break out into complaint, he is dragged to a tribunal, where <HI>no evidence is required.</HI> A &s;hrug, a look, a tear, or a &s;igh, betrays him. To repine at the cruelty of his fate is to be &s;u&s;|pected, and to be &s;u&s;pected is death.</P>
<P>We need not &s;tretch our view acro&s;s the At|lantic for &s;pecimens of French liberty; we may &s;ee enough without quitting our own country, or even our hou&s;es. The <HI>cockade proclamation</HI> of Citizen Adet is at once an in&s;ult to the United States, and an act of abominable tyranny on the
<PB N="32" REF="030227_0031_0FE54BFCFB00F718">
unfortunate French who have taken a refuge in them. They mu&s;t not only &s;uffer &s;hame for their country, but mu&s;t bear about them the &s;ign of its di&s;grace, the livery of the infamous Orleans. They mu&s;t not only be de&s;poiled of their wealth, and driven from their homes and their families, but mu&s;t drag their chains into di&s;tant lands. It is not enough that they &s;hould be branded with the name of &s;lave; they mu&s;t wear the &s;ymbol of their &s;lavery, and that, too, exactly where other men wear the &s;ymbol of courage and of honour!&mdash; Will not the people of America blu&s;h to think, that their repre&s;entatives were afraid to a&s;&s;ert, that they enjoyed a degree of freedom &s;uperior to this?</P>
<P>Of the <HI>enlightened</HI> people, now called the French nation, not one out of five hundred can &s;pell his own name. As to religion, four years ago they were &s;een kneeling with their faces prone to the earth, blubbering out their &s;ins, and be|&s;eeching ab&s;olution from the men whom, in a year afterwards, they degraded, in&s;ulted, muti|lated and murdered. After changing the catho|lic wor&s;hip, at the command of one gang of tyrants, for a wor&s;hip that was neither catholic nor prote&s;tant; at the command of another, they abandoned all wor&s;hip what&s;oever, and publicly rejoiced that
<Q>the &s;oul of man was like that of the bea&s;t.</Q>
A third gang orders them to be|lieve that there is a god: in&s;tantly the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive brutes acknowledge his exi&s;tence, and fall on their knees at the &s;ight of Robe&s;pierre, proclaim|ing the decree, with as much devotion as they formerly did at the elevation of the &s;acred ho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="030227_0032_0FE54BFF38C6F920">Politically con&s;idered, they are equally <HI>enlight|ened.</HI> Every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive faction has been the ob|ject of their huzzas, in the day of its power, and of their execrations in that of its fall. They crowded to the bar of the Convention to felici|tate Robe&s;pierre on his e&s;cape from the poignard of a woman; and, in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks after|wards, danced round his &s;caffold, and mocked his dying groans.&mdash;Fir&s;t they approve of a con|&s;titution with a hereditary monarch, who&s;e per&s;on they declare <HI>inviolable</HI> and <HI>&s;acred,</HI> and &s;wear to defend him with their lives. Next they murder this monarch, and declare them&s;elves a republic, to be governed by a &s;ingle chamber of delegates. This &s;econd con&s;titution they de&s;troy, and frame a third, with two chambers and five co-equal kings.&mdash;After having &s;pent five years in mak|ing war, in the name of liberty and equality, upon arms, &s;tars, garters, cro&s;&s;es, and every other exterior &s;ign of &s;uperiority of rank, they very peaceably and tamely &s;uffer their ma&s;ters to dub them&s;elves with what titles they plea&s;e, and ex|clu&s;ively to a&s;&s;ume garbs and badges of di&s;tinc|tion far more numerous than tho&s;e which former|ly exi&s;ted in France.</P>
<P>But, the circum&s;tance be&s;t calculated to give a ju&s;t idea of their ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit and &s;wini&s;h ignorance, is, their &s;anctioning a con&s;titution, which declares that they &s;hall elect the members of their a&s;&s;emblies, and then &s;ubmitting to a de|cree, obliging them to choo&s;e two-thirds of the number out of the Convention. Nor was this all; the Convention, not content with en&s;uring the re-election of the&s;e two-thirds, re&s;erved to it&s;elf the power of rejecting &s;uch members of the other third as it might not approve of!&mdash;And yet

<P>There is not a true American, and I love to believe that a very great majority of the people of the&s;e &s;tates are of that de&s;cription, who does not reject with &s;corn the idea of being upon a level with the regenerated French; not only in under&s;tanding, but in any re&s;pect whatever.

<P>After having contemplated the mode&s;t and humble tone of the Antifederal members towards France, it may not be ami&s;s to contra&s;t it with their language towards Great Britain, on an oc|ca&s;ion &s;omewhat &s;imilar.&mdash;It was reported, that His Britannic Maje&s;ty had i&s;&s;ued in&s;tructions for &s;eizing American ve&s;&s;els, contrary to the law of nations. It was, indeed, well known that many ve&s;&s;els were &s;eized; but it was not known that the &s;eizure was authori&s;ed by the&s;e in&s;tructions. They were equivocal, and therefore left room to hope that they were mi&s;con&s;trued, by intere&s;ted individuals, and that an indemnification would be obtained by a manly and temperate repre&s;en|tation of the injury. This hope, which was then entertained by the friends of the federal govern|ment, has &s;ince been completely realized. But, what was the tone of Mr. Madi&s;on, Mr. Clarke,
<PB N="35" REF="030227_0034_0FE54C02EA0E20E8">
Mr. Dayton, and all tho&s;e who are now for &s;often|ing their language towards France, till it &s;urpa&s;&s;es in effeminacy the pipe of a &s;ickly girl? What were the mea&s;ures they then propo&s;ed? <HI>Lay a double duty on their goods,</HI> &s;aid one; <HI>Prohibit all trade with them,</HI> &s;aid another; and Mr. Dayton offered a re&s;olution for
<Q>&s;eque&s;trating all debts due from the citizens of the United States to the &s;ubjects of the king of Great Britain.</Q>&mdash;
Thus, without waiting a moment to inquire whe|ther the king's in&s;tructions were mi&s;interpreted, or whether an indemnification was likely to be obtained, the &s;eizure was to be regarded as a commencement of ho&s;tilities; repri&s;als were im|mediately to be made, and that, too, in a mode that every honourable and hone&s;t man turns from with &s;corn.&mdash;Was this very <HI>"palatable,"</HI> Mr. Dayton?</P>
<P>It was during this memorable debate, that Mr. Smith from Maryland, <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> exclaimed:&mdash;
<Q>Let us adopt the re&s;olution. It will arre&s;t <HI>twenty millions</HI> of dollars in our hands, as a fund to reimbur&s;e the <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> millions, which we have been &s;tripped of by that <HI>piratical nation,</HI> Great Britain, according to the in&s;truc|tions of that <HI>king of &s;ea-robbers,</HI> that <HI>Leviathan</HI> who aims at &s;wallowing up all that &s;wims on the ocean, that <HI>mon&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e only law is power, and who re&s;pects neither the rights of nations, nor the property of individuals.</Q>&mdash;
Was this <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> &s;peech very
"palat|able?"&mdash;The&s;e political cooks &s;eem to be very &s;kilful in di&s;tingui&s;hing the difference be|tween the palates of Britons and that of the &s;oupe-maigre, frog-eating French, who can re|li&s;h nothing that is not<HI>bien cuit,</HI> or coddled to
<PB N="36" REF="030227_0035_0FE54C09DCD88D50">
mummy, except the fle&s;h and blood of ari&s;to|crats.</P>
<P>Striking as this contra&s;t is, it is not &s;een in its proper light, till accompanied with a compara|tive view of the injuries received from the two nations. The Briti&s;h, when they were called <HI>pirates, &s;ea-robbers,</HI> and <HI>mon&s;ters,</HI> by a member of Congre&s;s, had unlawfully &s;eized on American property, to the amount of
<Q><HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> mil|lions of dollars.</Q>
The French, even at that time, were guilty of the &s;ame aggre&s;&s;ions, and of this the Congre&s;s could not plead ignorance, as it was &s;tated to them by order of the Pre&s;ident, in the &s;ame report that complains of the conduct of the Briti&s;h. At the pre&s;ent epoch it is ac|knowledged that the depredations of the French are double in amount to tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h, be|fore any indemnification was obtained. But, to avoid all di&s;pute on this &s;ubject, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the lo&s;s from both nations to be of exactly the &s;ame amount, and confine our remarks to the va&s;t difference in their anterior &s;ituation and &s;ub|&s;equent conduct with re&s;pect to this country. Great Britain had no treaty, either of amity or commerce, with America; her conduct towards us, therefore, was &s;ubject to no rule but that pre&s;cribed by the general law of nations, the principles of which, often leaving room for mi&s;|interpretation, give a &s;cope to an abu&s;e of power, that does not, if reparation be demanded and obtained, fix the &s;tigma of cowardice or depen|dence on the injured nation. The &s;ituation of the French was quite different. The depreda|tions committed by them are in direct violation of a &s;olemn contract, voluntarily entered into with America. Great Britain excu&s;ed her&s;elf by
<PB N="37" REF="030227_0036_0FE54C0BC39E8380">
declaring (whether truly or not is no matter) that her orders had been mi&s;con&s;trued, that &s;he was ready to make re&s;titution, and it is well known that &s;he has made good this declaration, by pay|ing the full value of the cargoes and ve&s;&s;els ille|gally &s;eized. But, the conduct of the French leaves no room for an excu&s;e. They cannot plead a mi&s;con&s;truction of their orders, their &s;poliations have not taken place under an ambiguous in&s;truc|tion, but are warranted by a decree of their tyran|nical a&s;&s;embly; and, to deprive America of the hope of indemnification, and even of the ap|pearance of maintaining her rights, they have hurled this decree in our teeth. The Briti&s;h un|lawfully &s;eized on the property of Americans, or, if you will, in the polite language of Maryland Mr. Smith, that nation of "mon&s;ters" robbed them; but the mini&s;ter of the&s;e "mon&s;ters" did not pro|claim the plundering order in this country, and in|&s;ult the people whom they had robbed, by telling them that it was the fault of their own Executive. The French have done all this and ten times more: they have trampled upon the indepen|dence of Americans, braved them, &s;coffed at them; they have done every thing but kick the Pre&s;ident from his chair and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government: and yet Mr. Dayton, the <HI>ener|getic</HI> Mr. Dayton, &s;ays not a word about <HI>&s;eque&s;|tration;</HI> he is even afraid to compliment his con|&s;tituents on their <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould be <HI>unpalatable</HI> to this in&s;idious, treache|rous and in&s;olent nation. Not a word do we now hear about

Briti&s;h, "nothing," it was &s;aid,

Thus, one nation is &s;poken of with approbation, e&s;teem and affection; is even flattered and care&s;&s;ed, after loading us with inju|ries a thou&s;and times greater than tho&s;e which drew down on another nation the indecent and opprobrious terms of <HI>"pirates</HI> and <HI>mon&s;ters."</HI> Is this a proof of the candour or of the ob&s;tinate pre|judice, of the wi&s;dom or folly, of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives?

other &s;timulus than mutual intere&s;t, confidence and inclination, the two countries ru&s;hed together like congenial waters that had been &s;eparated by an artificial dyke.</P>
<P>It is this natural connection with Britain, the Briti&s;h capital, which a confidence in the &s;tability of the government invites hither, together with the credit that the merchants of that country give to tho&s;e of this, a credit which Briti&s;h merchants alone are either willing or able to give, that forms the great &s;ource of American wealth. Mr. Smith from Maryland, the <HI>polite</HI> Mr. Smith, who called the Briti&s;h <HI>"&s;ea-robbers</HI> and <HI>mon&s;ters,"</HI> incauti|ou&s;ly acknowledged, in the &s;ame breath, that the&s;e "mon&s;ters" gave a &s;tationary credit to this country amounting to <HI>twenty millions of dollars.</HI> Grateful gentleman!&mdash;A very great part of this credit is given for a twelve-month at lea&s;t; &s;o that the &s;imple intere&s;t on it amounts to <HI>one million two hundred thou&s;and dollars annually;</HI> an advantage to this country that might have merited in return &s;omething <HI>"more palatable"</HI> than "<HI>&s;ea-robbers</HI> and <HI>"mon&s;ters."</HI></P>
<P>If America could obtain what &s;he &s;tands in need of (which &s;he cannot) from any other coun|try than Britain, from what country on earth could &s;he obtain them on terms like the&s;e? The capacity of France, in the brighte&s;t days of her commercial pro&s;perity, was fairly tried. Cor|re&s;pondencies were opened with her merchants; but what was the re&s;ult? The total ruin of them and of all tho&s;e who were concerned with them. They are no more; they are forgotten. Their trade could be equalled in &s;hortne&s;s of duration by nothing but the wear of their merchandi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="030227_0040_0FE54C1742BE31B8">To &s;ay, as &s;ome of the French faction have done, that America does not want the manufactures of Britain, is an in&s;ult on the national di&s;cernment little &s;hort of the <HI>Blunderbu&s;s</HI> of my old friend Citizen Adet. Let any man take a view of his dre&s;s (when he is dre&s;&s;ed like a man), from head to foot, from the garments that he wears to &s;ea, to plough, to market or to church, down to tho&s;e with which he &s;teps into bed; let him look round his &s;hop, and round the &s;hops of his neighbours; let him examine his library, his bed-chamber, his par|lour and his kitchen, and then let him &s;ay how great a part of all he &s;ees, of all that is indi&s;|pen&s;able, u&s;eful or convenient; let him &s;ay how great a part of all this comes from Great Britain, and how &s;mall a one from France or any other country; and then, if he be fool enough, let him &s;ay with the Gallican faction, that we &s;tand in no need of the manufactures of Britain.</P>
<P>The commercial connection between this coun|try and Great Britain is full as nece&s;&s;ary as that between the baker and miller, while the connec|tion between America and France may be com|pared to one between the baker and the milliner or toyman. France may furni&s;h us with looking gla&s;&s;es; but without the aid of Britain we &s;hall be a&s;hamed to &s;ee our&s;elves in them, unle&s;s the &s;ans|culottes can per&s;uade us that thread-bare beggary is a beauty. France may deck the heads of our wives and daughters (but by the bye, &s;he &s;han't tho&s;e of mine) with ribbons, gauze, and powder, their ears with bobs, their cheeks with paint, and their heels with gaudy party-coloured &s;ilk, as rotten as the hearts of the manufacturers; but Great Britain mu&s;t cover their and our bodies. When the rain pours down and wa&s;hes the ro&s;e

from the cheek; when the bleak north-we&s;ter blows through the gauze, then it is that we know our friends. Great Britain mu&s;t wrap us up warm, and keep us all decent, &s;nug and comfortable, from the child in &s;waddling cloths to its tottering grand|&s;ire. France may &s;end us cockades, as &s;he does (or has done) in abundance; but Great Britain mu&s;t &s;end us hats to &s;tick them in. France may furni&s;h the ruffle, but Great Britain mu&s;t &s;end us the &s;hirt; and the commerce of the latter nation is ju&s;t as much more nece&s;&s;ary to this country than that of the former, as a good decent &s;hirt is more nece&s;&s;ary than a paltry di&s;hclout of a ruffle.</P>
<P>As, then, the importance of a trade, with any nation, mu&s;t be the &s;tandard whereby to mea&s;ure the embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;s that its &s;u&s;pen&s;ion would produce, it is evident that a war with Great Britain would, in this re&s;pect, have been productive of infinite calamities to America, while a war with France would hardly be felt. The dangers, therefore, to be apprehended from mi|litary operations only, remain to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>By going back to the epoch when the ho&s;tile tone was a&s;&s;umed towards Great Britain, I could repre&s;ent her as in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>We&s;tern Po&s;ts,</HI> and con&s;equently as in a &s;ituation to arm and &s;up|port the Indians, to harra&s;s that frontier, and by tho&s;e means find employment for an army of the United States, and that a very expen&s;ive one too. But, I &s;hall decline this advantage, &s;hall con&s;ider things in their pre&s;ent &s;tate; I &s;hall even &s;uppo&s;e all inroads from Canada impo&s;&s;ible, &s;hall turn my eyes to the &s;ea only, and there take a view of
<PB N="43" REF="030227_0042_0FE54C1AE92F51D8">
what might be rea&s;onably feared from a war with Great Britain, and what from a war with France.</P>
<P>The mighty difference in the maritime power, &s;kill and courage of the two nations, is &s;o univer|&s;ally known, and has undergone &s;o many and &s;o convincing proofs during the pre&s;ent war, that any compari&s;on in this re&s;pect would be &s;uperflu|ous. The hirelings of France, do, however, pre|tend that &s;he could eat us up alive, crack us as a &s;quirrel does a nut, while we could boldly bid de|fiance to her rival. I &s;hall not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for Great Britain to bombard our towns and burn our &s;hipping, I &s;hall look upon all our harbours as completely defended; I &s;hall even &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible for her to make a landing on any part of our coa&s;t, to carry off a &s;ingle &s;ack of flour or head of cattle; and only in&s;i&s;t, that, with thirty detached frigates and a &s;quadron of twenty &s;hips of the line, &s;he could completely block up every principal port in the United States, in defiance of the French and their new allies, Holland and Spain. If I am told to look back to what &s;he was able to do, in this way, la&s;t war; I reply, that the commerce, the foreign relation&s;hips, of this country, are not now what they were then, nor would the &s;pecies of war, carried on by Britain, be the &s;ame. Then &s;he had armies on the land, on which the operations of her fleet were depen|dent. It had garri&s;ons to &s;upply, convoys to e&s;|cort, and tran&s;ports to conduct from one &s;tate to another. Tho&s;e who look to France and her al|lies for relief, forget that during this war France has lo&s;t <HI>thirty-nine</HI> &s;hips of the line, with a pro|portionate number of frigates; that the remnant of her &s;hattered fleet is now blocked up in her own ports, and that her petty armaments &s;kulk
<PB N="44" REF="030227_0043_0FE54C1E6786A318">
about from harbour to harbour, as if their only object was to keep out of &s;ight. They forget that the Dutch dare not peep out of the Texel, and that the Spaniards, after mu&s;tering their all together, are &s;tationed before a place of refuge in the Mediterranean. In this &s;ituation of things nothing could prevent Great Britain from totally cutting off the commerce of America, exports as well as imports, trebling the price of every ar|ticle of foreign manufacture, and rendering the produce of the land a drug; de&s;troying the re|venue of the country at the very moment that a tenfold augmentation of it would be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From the French and their allies, on the contrary, America has little, nay nothing to fear. When we are told about their demoli&s;hing our towns and invading our country, it &s;eems to be forgotten that they mu&s;t cro&s;s the &s;ea to come to us. Fear &s;eems to have deranged the trembling wretches who hold this language. They talk and think about the prowe&s;s of the barbarian armies, till they imagine us divided from them by a river only, or that it is as ea&s;y for a hundred thou&s;and of them to be &s;hipped off and landed in America, as for them to cro&s;s the Rhine; they imagine that a fleet of three hundred tran&s;ports and fifty &s;hips of the line as ea&s;ily erected as a bridge of boats. And, during this terrific reverie, it never once &s;trikes them that Great Britain is at war with the French, or that her fleets would blow them to atoms, before they could approach our coa&s;t. Mr. Giles, and all tho&s;e who talk about the dan|ger of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the French, delight in repre&s;enting her as ready to make an attack on us in conjunction with the Spaniards. This is true, and we are informed that they have

already &s;et the&s;e their "natural allies," to &s;eize and confi&s;cate our ve&s;&s;els <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is pretended by France, that our treaty with Britain contra|venes that with her; and for that rea&s;on &s;he &s;eizes our ve&s;&s;els. Groundle&s;s and in&s;olent as this pretext is, it is worth noticing now that the Spaniards have begun to imitate her. We had <HI>no treaty</HI> with them, when that with Great Britain was formed, and therefore, I pre&s;ume, that the "<HI>magnanimous</HI> Spani&s;h monarch," as Mr. Swanwick called him, will allege that our treaty with him was contravened <HI>be|fore it was made;</HI> nor &s;hould I much wonder, if members in Congre&s;s were to be found, courageous and patriotic enough to attempt to &s;up|port the charge.&mdash;This is all that is wanted to fill up the mea&s;ure of our humiliation.</NOTE>. There is no doubt but both nations would willingly co-operate in &s;uch an enterprize; but I would a&s;k Mr. Giles &s;eriou&s;ly, whether he thinks America would &s;tand &s;ingly in the war; whether he thinks the govern|ment or the people &s;o incorrigibly blind and &s;tupid, as, while they &s;ee the French calling in all hell to their aid, to refu&s;e the only a&s;&s;i&s;tance capable of repul&s;ing the infernal ho&s;t.&mdash;Oh, Lord! &s;ays Mr. Giles, what are you talking about!

&s;ays Citizen Adet, and &s;o &s;ays every Frenchman as well as Mr. Giles. Yes; this is what they "di&s;like," this is the thing, and the only thing, they are afraid of, and it is for that very rea&s;on that it ought to take place.</P>
<P>But, I &s;hould be glad to know on what Mr. Giles founds his "di&s;like" to this connection, in ca&s;e of a war. He acknowledges its "pecuniary advantages," and that is one great point gained; for you well know, Mr. Giles, that in <HI>connec|tions

with foreign nations</HI> nothing goes on cheerly <HI>without money.</HI> What, then, can be the objection? Becau&s;e America is a <HI>Republic</HI> and Britain a <HI>Mo|narchy?</HI> This was the old objection to the treaty of amity and commerce with Great Britain; but it very luckily happened that, ju&s;t before that treaty was concluded, the Republic of France had made a &s;imilar treaty with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and now, as if on purpo&s;e to give us a &s;econd ex|ample, &s;he has concluded a treaty offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with the king of Spain, and has called that nation her "<HI>natural</HI> allies."&mdash;Now, Mr. Giles, rub that <HI>forehead</HI> of yours a little, and tell me &s;incerely, without any quibbling or &s;ubterfuge, whether you think the Spaniards are more <HI>natu|rally</HI> allied to the French than the Americans are to the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>Surely no nation was ever &s;o completely duped as America has been by the French and their par|tizans! By a &s;incere and hearty alliance with Great Britain, &s;he would not only place her&s;elf in a &s;ituation to make a peremptory demand of indemnification from France, but, in ca&s;e of re|fu&s;al, would be able to &s;trip both France and Spain of every inch of territory they po&s;&s;e&s;s in this hemi&s;phere. There is no danger of any other nation taking umbrage at this. America and Great Britain might bid defiance to the world. The map of this continent and its i&s;lands lies open before them: they might cut and carve for them&s;elves, and &s;it down in the quiet enjoy|ment of their conque&s;ts. The very mention of &s;uch an alliance would &s;care the Dons at the bot|tom of their mines, and would make the <HI>&s;even hundred and five tyrants</HI> tremble on their thrones.

From this adjunct to the title, we might have expected from the Great Tom Paine, the prince of demagogues, &s;omething like a review of the Pre&s;ident's admini&s;tration and a developement of diplomatic and cabinet &s;ecrets. It was not being over &s;anguine to expect this much from a member of the "illuminated and illuminating A&s;&s;embly of France," and a maker of con&s;titutions be&s;ides. But, alas! how have we been di&s;appointed! That part of your letter, which treats of what you call <HI>"public affairs,"</HI> is no more than a repetition of one or two pa&s;&s;ages of Citizen Adet's in&s;olent notes, which had been &s;entenced to general execration a month before you letter appeared.

of the rea&s;ons on which they are founded, it is in compliance with that claim, and not in complai&s;ance to the inhabitant of a dungeon, that I proceed to ob&s;erve on what you have had the impudence to a&s;&s;ert: viz. 1. That our treaty with Britain ju&s;tifies the &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els by the French. 2.

That our Federal con&s;titution is an
<Q>incon&s;i&s;tent in|&s;trument,</Q>
which, if you live to return to America, you will have altered. 4. That all which General Wa&s;hington did in the American revolution, might have been done by any other man as well as by him, and that he has neither talents nor virtues, either as a &s;tate&s;man or a ge|neral.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions; to wit, <HI>That our treaty with Britain ju&s;tifies the &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els by the French,</HI> you attempt to &s;upport by a mo&s;t barefaced mi&s;con&s;truction of the &s;econd article of our treaty with France. This article &s;ays, that the contracting parties engage mutually, not to grant any particular <HI>favour</HI> to other nations, in re&s;pect to commerce and navigation, <HI>that &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party.</HI>

<P>You were informed of the piratical orders they had i&s;&s;ued, and were commanded to prepare a ju&s;tification.

Do you think that we have ne|ver read this treaty? And, if we had not, do you think there is a man among us fool enough to be|lieve that it contains &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion? If you do, your opinion of the people of your
<Q>belov|ed America</Q>
mu&s;t be much changed.</P>
<P>This article, out of which you have culled <HI>two,</HI> and only <HI>two words,</HI> runs thus:
<Q>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the <HI>precise cases</HI> in which <HI>alone</HI> provi&s;ions and other articles, not generally contraband, <HI>may be regarded as such,</HI> renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the mi&s;|under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e: It is agreed, that, whenever any &s;uch articles, <HI>so be|coming contraband,</HI> according to the <HI>exi&s;ting law

<P><HI>Playfair</HI> calls you
<Q>the clum&s;y advocate of in|&s;urrection,</Q>
and you are certainly as clum&s;y an advocate of piracy. Poor Citizen Adet is a lame hand enough, but you are &s;till wor&s;e; he did flounce about and made a noi&s;e before he &s;unk; but you ju&s;t make a bubble, and go to the bottom at once, like a &s;tone or a lump of lead.</P>
<P>I now come to your charge again&s;t the Pre&s;ident re&s;pecting your detention in pri&s;on. You in&s;i&s;t that you were &s;till a citizen of America, and that therefore it was his duty to demand your enlarge|ment.&mdash;You perceived that you had lo&s;t all claim to citizen&s;hip here, in virtue of the article which extends that deprivation to all tho&s;e
<Q>who &s;hall accept of any title or <HI>office</HI> under any foreign king, prince, or <HI>&s;tate.</HI></Q>
To get rid of this you have recour&s;e to a curious quibble: you pretend that this provi&s;ion did not embrace your ca&s;e, be|cau&s;e France, at the time you joined the legi&s;la|tive mob was neither a kingdom, principality nor <HI>&s;tate,</HI> but <HI>a people in a &s;tate of revolution.</HI></P>
<P>That France was not worthy of the name of <HI>&s;tate</HI> I am very ready to allow. The French were then, what they are now, a horde of &s;avages, engaged in the work of de&s;truction. But, be this as it might, France was acknowledged as a <HI>&s;tate</HI> by America, and even you, I pre&s;ume, will not have
<PB N="8" REF="030227_0054_0FE54C38AD8E4310">
the impudence to deny, that &s;he was declared to be a republic too, the very fir&s;t day that you took your &s;eat in the convention, and, if a republic, &s;he was certainly a &s;tate. Admitting your own doctrine, then, to have pre&s;erved your claim to American citizen&s;hip, you &s;hould have abdicated your &s;eat, the in&s;tant this declaration took place.</P>
<P>You contend that a man may lend a hand to <HI>form a con&s;titution</HI> for a nation who has none, without forfeiting his citizen&s;hip in his own coun|try. This may be &s;o: it is non&s;en&s;e, and there|fore not worth di&s;puting about. But why did you not retire as &s;oon as your job was done. You continued your &s;eat after you had made and &s;worn to and made every one el&s;e &s;wear to your &s;illy work.

Was not the convention every thing, legi&s;lative, executive and diplomatic; judicial, military and <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tic?</HI> Were not &s;ome of you watching the armies, others &s;uperintending the guillotine, and others preach|ing &s;ermons of athei&s;m?

Nay, did you not pre&s;ide <HI>as judge</HI> ("ah! righteous ra&s;cally judge!") on the trial of Louis the XVIth?

Hence the appellations of "Briti&s;h tyrant," and "willing &s;laves;" and all the acrimonious and di&s;dainful language that was for a long time held towards that nation.

<P>The object of your ma&s;ters, in having re|cour&s;e to you on this occa&s;ion, is evident to every one. Your letter was written at the time they were pa&s;&s;ing the decree for authorizing the viola|tion of their treaty with America. To prevent the people here from re&s;enting the injury, it was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;uade them that it was owing
<PB N="18" REF="030227_0064_0FE54C55EC228DB0">
to the mal-admini&s;tration of their own govern|ment, and this could not be done without under|mining the character of him who pre&s;ided over it.

<P>Your tyrants are completely baffled. The ef|fects of your letter are exactly the contrary to what it was intended to produce. There is but one thing on earth nearer to the hearts of all true Americans than their con&s;titution, and that is, the &s;potle&s;s character of their chief. Your brutal attempt to blacken this character was all that was wanted to crown his honour and your infamy. You never before &s;unk to a level with the damned, but now you are plunged beneath them.

<HEAD>PROPOSALS, <HI>By William Cobbett, Book-Seller, of Philadelphia,</HI> FOR PUBLISHING <HI>A NEWS-PAPER,</HI> TO BE ENTITLED, Porcupine's Gazette AND DAILY ADVERTISER.</HEAD>
<P>METHINKS I hear the reader exclaim:
<Q>What! have we not Gazettes enough al|ready?</Q>
Yes, and far too many: but tho&s;e that we have, are, in general, conducted in &s;uch a manner that their great number, in&s;tead of ren|dering mine unnece&s;&s;ary, is the only cau&s;e that calls for its e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The gazettes in this country have done it more real injury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They mi&s;lead the people at home and mi&s;repre&s;ent them abroad. It was the&s;e vehicles of &s;edition and di&s;cord that encouraged the coun|ties in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> to rebel; it was they that gave ri&s;e to the depredations of Britain, by exciting the people to &s;uch acts of violence again&s;t that nation, as left her no room to doubt that we were deter|mined on war; and it was they, when an accom|modation had been happily effected, that &s;tirred up an oppo&s;ition to it &s;uch as has &s;eldom been witne&s;&s;ed, and which was overcome by mere chance. The&s;e gazettes it was, that, by mi&s;re|pre&s;enting the di&s;po&s;itions of the people, encou|raged the French to proceed from one degree of
<PB REF="030227_0066_0FE54C5A5DF2E2A8">
in&s;olence to another, till at la&s;t their mini&s;ter braves the Pre&s;ident in his chair, and a bullying commander comes and tells us that his only bu|&s;ine&s;s is to &s;eize our ve&s;&s;els, in violation of a trea|ty, by virtue of which alone he claims a right to enter our ports: and it is the&s;e gazettes that now have the impudence to defend what their fal&s;e|hood and malice have produced.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told, that the people are to blame; that they are not obliged to read the&s;e abominable publications. But they <HI>do read</HI> them; and thou|&s;ands who read them, read nothing el&s;e. To &s;up|pre&s;s them is impo&s;&s;ible; they will vomit forth their poi&s;on; it is a privilege of their natures, that no law can abridge; and therefore the only mode left, is, to counteract its effects.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be done, too, in their own way. Books, or periodical publications in the form of books, may be of &s;ome &s;ervice, but are by no means a match for their flying folios. A fal&s;e|hood that remains uncontradicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth, and when the detection at la&s;t makes its appearance, it is often as u&s;ele&s;s as that of the doctor who finds his pa|tient expired.</P>
<P>The only method of oppo&s;ition, then, is to meet them on their own ground; to &s;et foot to foot; di&s;pute every inch and every hair's breadth; fight them at their own weapons, and return them two blows for one.</P>
<P>A gazette of this &s;tamp is what I have long wi&s;hed to &s;ee, but I have wi&s;hed and expected it in vain. Indignation at the &s;upinene&s;s of others
<PB REF="030227_0067_0FE54C5C85CFDE88">
has at la&s;t got the better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has determined me to encoun|ter the ta&s;k.</P>
