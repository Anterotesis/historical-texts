</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Di&s;ea&s;e of a venal Majority in the great council of the nation, may be truly called a mortification in the body politic. This de&s;perate ca&s;e requires a de&s;perate remedy. A pa|triotic King would neither delay, nor fear the ap|plication. Its &s;ucce&s;s depends upon the hand that operates. The operation of a whole&s;ome and &s;a|lutary de&s;olution has been wi&s;ely in&s;tru&s;ted by our con&s;iderate ance&s;tors to the &s;overeign. The exer|tion of this great prerogative was petitioned for, with the greate&s;t rea&s;on, during the tyranny and iniquities of the la&s;t venal parliament, by the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t loyal, and re&s;pectable metropolis in the univer&s;e, the city of London. It was petitioned for, and twice refu&s;ed.</P>

<P><PB N="200" REF="013990_0002_0F92590B8B9587C8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">tion. If a tyrannic parliament &s;till per&s;i&s;ts, a <HI>Pa|triot King,</HI> (like an hone&s;t dictator) will di&s;&s;olve &s;uch mi&s;creants.</P>
<P>Thus corruption will be extingui&s;hed, hone&s;t repre&s;entatives elected, and a good King enthroned in the hearts of a grateful and affectionate people, whom he has thus con&s;titutionally protected from &s;lavery and ruin. What, (&s;ays &s;ome mini&s;terial &s;cribbler, a John&s;on perhaps) &s;hall a King of Eng|land detach him&s;elf from his Parliament? I an&s;wer Yes; if that Parliament is corrupt, wicked, and tyrannical; it is then no con&s;titutional Parliament, but an illicit gang; nor is he con&s;titutional King, but a daring and unthinking tyrant, who adheres to them. By &s;o doing, he plainly &s;hews that it is not his intention to protect, but to en&s;lave his peo|ple. That venerable body alone can be called a Parliament, who are known, according to the im|port of the word <HI>(parler le ment)</HI> to &s;peak their mind, to be above all human influence. Can this be &s;aid of a &s;ervile, dete&s;table, in&s;idious, uncon&s;ti|tutional majority, who came to the great council, with a mercenary gagg in their mouths, their per|fidious names in the court calendar, and Lord Bute's (under the colour of Lord North's) in&s;tructions in their pockets? Our Kings, it is true, are parlia|mentary Kings, but there is a wide difference be|tween a parliament and a cabal; between &s;ages convened, and voters hired, between free, con&s;ti|tutional &s;tates, and &s;ervile, mini&s;terial dependents.</P>
<P>When a Parliament is degenerated thus far, they loo&s;e their honour, they ought to loo&s;e their former name; they de&s;erve no farther confidence. They would find none, in a wi&s;e and good King. No
<PB N="201" REF="013990_0003_0F92590C495A2E28">Prince who is not under the ideocy, in&s;anity, or the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, could adhere to &s;uch a junto. Such men are audacious in calling them&s;elves a Parliament. They no longer repre&s;ent, but u&s;urp; they are not faithful &s;ervants, but a&s;&s;uming tyrants, they are not coun&s;ellors of the King, but traytors to the people. A great council, (or rather a great majority) compo&s;ed of &s;uch mon&s;ters, &s;uch pe&s;ts of a community, cannot be &s;aid either to regard, or to repre&s;ent a people; their views and intere&s;ts are different. The people &s;ue for protection, they for places; the people wi&s;h to &s;upport the con&s;ti|tution, they to &s;upply their luxury; the people are affected by the decay of commerce, they by the large&s;&s;es of the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Can a patriotic King confide in, or co-operate with &s;uch a mock-parliament? When we hear a King talk of &s;teadily pur&s;uing the advice of the great council of the nation, it mu&s;t be taken for granted, that he knows and believes the majority of that council (who&s;e votes are deci&s;ive of the fate of this kingdom) to be incorrupt. Can &s;uch faith as this be found in I&s;rael? If not, a King of England may well be a&s;ked, even by the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects, why he is wicked enough, or weak enough, to approve, &s;anctify and confirm, the de&s;potic acts, not of &s;uch a parliament, but of &s;uch a traiterous convention? Is it his duty in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to confide or to di&s;&s;olve? In &s;uch a danger|ous cri&s;is the con&s;titution has given a judicial pow|er to Kings; they are bound to exerci&s;e that pow|er, not for the de&s;truction, but for the &s;afety of the commonwealth. They are not to con&s;ult the views, the wi&s;hes, the intere&s;ts, or &s;ecurity of mi|ni&s;ters
<PB N="202" REF="013990_0004_0F92590D07688BA0">or favourites, but the &s;alvation of the king|dom. Our laws, under which every king mu&s;t &s;ubmit to reign, &s;peaks plainly to the &s;overeign, in open, intelligible, rational terms, when it &s;ays, <HI>"Ce&s;&s;a regnare, &s;i non vis judicare."</HI>
<Q>If you will not exerci&s;e tho&s;e judicial powers, with which the con&s;titution has entru&s;ted you, re&s;ign your crown, you are no longer fit to reign over a free people.</Q> The word <HI>(judicare)</HI> in the maxim abovementioned, extends not merely to the exer|tion of a King's judicial powers in civil, or crimi|nal ca&s;es, (though this would be the fal&s;e interpre|tation of a Mansfield) but it mu&s;t be taken in its large&s;t, and mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e; it is allowed by every hone&s;t man, learned interpreter, to extend to the whole &s;y&s;tem of the King's executive powers. In that large &s;en&s;e it has ever been con&s;idered by &s;uch political writers as Locke, Sidney, Acherly, and Nathaniel Bacon, who writes &s;o admirably on government.</P>
<P>This maxim is &s;trong, and pointed; it comes directly home to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and opens a large field for no very favourable inferences at the pre&s;ent juncture. A King of England mu&s;t not, cannot live for him&s;elf, (much le&s;s for his minions) but only for his people. I &s;peak an hone&s;t, con|&s;titutional truth, when I &s;ay that he mu&s;t not in|dulge, but toil. A King's revenues, magnificence, &s;plendor, pomp, and grandeur, are not de&s;igned to emblazon him, but to do honour to his kingdom. All his glittering rays of Maje&s;ty are reflected from the people. An Engli&s;h throne is like a Turki&s;h Sopha, to be made the idle &s;eat of &s;lumber and re|po&s;e. It is erected for the exerci&s;e of mercy, truth,
<PB N="203" REF="013990_0005_0F92590DC41E13C0">and ju&s;tice. Neither of the&s;e princely attributes is concerned in maintaining corruption, or repelling ju&s;t &s;uitors without redre&s;s; nay, with ignominious language and contempt. It is a King of England's duty to clean&s;e the Augean &s;table. He is the Argus of the commonwealth; his eyes, his ears, his men|tal powers, mu&s;t all be open to his people, whil&s;t his royal pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubdued. He can acquire neither honour nor &s;ecurity by an injudicious &s;trug|gle with his &s;ubjects. Truth and liberty will pre|vail. Tyrants and fools have been dethroned. In|jured &s;ubjects have triumphed and exulted in their ruin. Minions, and abandoned mini&s;ters have been guarded to the &s;caffold; and corruption it&s;elf, tho' not to be di&s;&s;olved, may be at la&s;t extingui&s;hed, in another glorious and nece&s;&s;ary revolution.</P>
<P>The&s;e are le&s;&s;ons which Engli&s;h princes &s;hould be taught betimes in their minority. By the&s;e, even Kings them&s;elves, may profit in riper yeas. By the&s;e, the pre&s;ent obdurate, deluded &s;overeign, whom heaven has not been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s with any great &s;hare of natural di&s;cernment, may be taught to avoid the&s;e mi&s;eries, which mu&s;t attend his ra&s;h and head&s;trong per&s;everance, his unju&s;t and guilty confidence; his tyrannic pride, and an in&s;o|lent contempt of that people, through who&s;e pa|tience and indulgence, he mo&s;t unworthily holds the crown of England.</P>
