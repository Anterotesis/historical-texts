<P>WHAT can be more &s;hock|ing to the human mind than the appearance of one of tho&s;e fallen angels that were turn|ed out of heaven, and now make the habitations of darkne&s;s their homes! Such an appearance would &s;trike terror into the mo&s;t un&s;haken mind, the mo&s;t hard &amp; &s;tubborn heart; yea, of &s;uch a kind as no one can conceive of, but tho&s;e who have had the trial, which has been ours&mdash;an account of which we now &s;end abroad.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 24th of May, 1784, John Che&s;&s;elden and James Arkins, &s;et out from Kenfry, a town near the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi, to vi&s;it an old friend of ours, who lived about twenty

The road that led to this place was through a wood, called Var|num's wood, on account of its belonging to one Varnum. We &s;at out about 8 o'clock in the morning; &s;oon after which, James Arkins began to tell me, (John Che&s;&s;elden) that &s;hould we in pa&s;&s;ing this wood, meet with &s;uch a devil of a fright as I&s;aac King did, (a per&s;on who pa&s;&s;ed them a few months before, and &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;aw a per&s;on without either head or arms) we &s;hould de&s;erve to &s;tay in them, and never be &s;uffered to return or pa&s;s them. He likewi&s;e &s;aid that per&s;ons of the character of King, ought to be bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of all that had either &s;pirits or common &s;en&s;e; and that he defied all the devils in|habiting the infernal regions to intimidate him in the lea&s;t, &s;hould they be plea&s;ed to appear to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

this &s;peech of his, I undertook to reprimand him for his un|guarded talk, telling him that al|though I &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;aid King was frightened, at nothing more than imagination, yet I believed the devil was often permitted to appear to men, tho' we had not &s;een the appearance, This talk &s;eemed greatly to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, in&s;omuch that he &s;aid if there ev|er appeared a devil or any &s;pirit unto men while on earth, he de&s;ir|ed that he might in pa&s;&s;ing this wood, have one of them for a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Little did he, as well as my&s;elf thing of the&s;e words of his being fulfilled; which however was done, in a mo&s;t frightful and &s;hocking manner; in a manner which clearly &s;hewed it to be the hand of heaven, that it &s;hould be as he de&s;ired, and which &s;hews us that the all-wi&s;e God ob&s;erves the actions of men, and often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

We had not gone far before we ro&s;e a &s;mall hill, on the other &s;ide of which, near the bottom, &s;tood a large bunch of bu&s;hes, in which was this ru&s;ttling of leaves.

He had not been out of the bu&s;hes above the &s;pabe of a minute, before he &s;tood erect up|on his feet, and greatly altered both in &s;hape and ge&s;ture; at the &s;ight of which we both fell pro&s;|trate on the ground, and &s;o con|tinued a while, wholly in&s;en&s;i|ble; when at length, I John Che&s;&s;elden partly recovered from my in&s;en&s;ibility and rai&s;ing my|&s;elf up partly on my hands and feet, di&s;covered this mon&s;ter about three yards from me, in a hori|zontal po&s;ture, in the clear fluid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

My com|panion, James Arkins, being not yet recovered, I thought, if po&s;&s;i|ble, to do it, and endeavour to make our e&s;cape from the feroci|ous tyrant: whereupon I &s;tepped up to him and upon gently touch|ing him, he immediately, its great &s;urprize &s;prang up, and with a loud voice exclaimed, God be merciful to me the greate&s;t of &s;inners, and mo&s;t worthy of thy di&s;plea&s;ure. Upon the&s;e words being pronounced, this truly frightful mon&s;ter immediately left his &s;ituation in the air, and &s;tood upright on his feet before the &s;aid James Arkins, without either head or hands, and in the very form which the fore men|tioned King had repre&s;ented. In this po&s;ture he continued for a|bout the &s;pace of half an hour, &s;tanding the whole of the time

Here in this place he &s;ent forth the mo&s;t horrid cry that perhaps ever mor|tals heard, or devils uttered. It was &s;o &s;trong a &s;ound, that the earth where we &s;tood was in great commotion, and every tree ap|peared to be leaving its foudation. It is not po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe our feelings at the&s;e moments when we expected &s;o &s;hortly to bid a|dieu to our earthly bodies; to be de&s;troyed by this univer&s;al ty|rant; what to do we knew not; to flee from him was not in our power.

No &s;ooner had we attempted to move, than the mon&s;ter aro&s;e from his &s;eat, which when he took, he was without head or hands, or any kind of garment, but was now adorned with all the&s;e, and of the mo&s;t dazzling appearance; and truly had a more &s;triking appearance than the greate&s;t po|tentate or prince on earth;&mdash; and in this form made up to us, where he &s;tood for &s;ome time, as likewi&s;e did we, without either attempting to move in the lea&s;t; but at length we undertook to proceed on our way back from whence we came, which when he &s;aw, he made up to us, and with a very plea&s;ant voice, &s;aid, why do you hurry your&s;elves, friends; I will &s;hortly be your companion, and will attend you where you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

After he had proceeded in this manner about 20 rods, he again came upon the &s;urface of the earth, and proceeded with us on our way until we were within one hundred rods of our habita|tions, when he told us we had got to go a little way with him, where he would &s;hew us &s;everal cities, mo&s;t elegantly adorned with a thou&s;and objects that would highly elevate us, and where he &s;aid were many plea&s;|ant dwelling places, which, with|out doubt, we &s;hould &s;o greatly fancy that he believed we &s;hould be willing to take up with them

for our abodes and la&s;ting homes, where likewi&s;e he &s;aid were many that &s;poke our language, and he believed were our countrymen.

Upon this &s;peech of mine, he ap|peared greatly incen&s;ed and im|mediately caught James Arkins by the hair of his head, and with a horrid cry &s;aid, what &s;uch young up&s;tarts as you di&s;obey my will!

out at lea&s;t one half of the hair of his head, and wounding him in many parts of his body. Now it was about &s;un&s;et, and we were at lea&s;t four miles from any inhabitants, in this deplora|ble &s;ituation, never expecting to be in any other, with Arkins groaning with his wounds and death &s;taring us in the face on every &s;ide.&mdash;Here, gentle reader, drop a tear at our condition in the&s;e moments, when we expect|ed never to e&s;cape to inform the world of our feelings or the cau&s;e of our deaths. But Heaven be prai&s;ed; now did we even in the&s;e moments that &s;o &s;hortly threatened our ruin, get from his infernal hands. Seeing night was come upon us, and we &s;till in the hands of the devil, who every minute would a&s;&s;ume what|ever forms he plea&s;ed, and them which were the mo&s;t &s;hocking to behold, I re&s;olved to look up to

heaven for relief, fell upon my bended knees and cryed with a loud voice to him who made the heavens, that he would not &s;uf|fer us to be de&s;troyed by this fallen angel, who was driven out of heaven and &s;entenced to dwell in chains and everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment. Immediately upon the tyrant's hearing the&s;e words, he vani&s;hed out of our &s;ight, and was gone; upon which I imme|diately took Arkins on my back, who was &s;o wounded that he could not walk, and arrived &s;afe|ly at our own homes about 8 o' clock at night.</P>
<P>But by the way, we mu&s;t not forget to inform the reader, that among the many forms this ty|rant a&s;&s;umed, was this truly &s;ur|pri&s;ing one: as the dark of the evening approached, Arkins be|ing in great di&s;tre&s;s with his wounds, and as I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome|thing &s;hattered in rea&s;on, he cri|ed
<PB N="15" REF="030187_0015_0FE4FD3BC65D8828">
out, who, or which of you can deliver me out of the&s;e deep agonies? upon which the devil &s;aid, I will give you the relief you de&s;erve, and in&s;tantly mount|ed a large rock, upon which he had the perfect form of two per|&s;ons, both lying pro&s;trate, one like a man when expiring, utter|ing the mo&s;t piercing groans that perhaps ever mortals heard, and &s;aying, oh my ruined and depart|ing &s;oul! The other form in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embled a man, tho' much larger, with one cloven foot, his face black, and ge&s;tures very terrible. After they had continued in this po&s;ture &s;ome time, the one in form of a man, uttered &s;everal more piercing groans than any of the former, and violently &s;truggling, &s;eemed to die immediately! upon which there &s;eemed to come or evapor|ate from his body, the &s;ame form or likene&s;s, to appearance com|po&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="030187_0016_0FE4FD3D4BA3FB00">
of pure air, whick kept in a gentle motion or tremor for &s;ome time&mdash;when at length, this other form aro&s;e upon his feet, with an a&s;pect very terrible, &s;tep|ped to the utmo&s;t extremity of the rock, where he extended his arms to receive this form in the air, which gradually made to|wards him, tho &s;eemingly with great reluctance, until it came within them, when he gra&s;ped it with the greate&s;t fury, and im|mediately leaped down upon the ground, which when his feet touched, gave way for the &s;pace of two rods in circumference, and &s;unk directly down, leaving a large cavity, into which he de|&s;cended with this form or body in his arms, where appeared melt|ed minerals or brim&s;tone, dread|ful to behold&punc; in which they both continued &s;ome time, where were groans not to be uttered. At length he who had the cloven
<PB N="17" REF="030187_0017_0FE4FD5362D48100">
foot came out of this place, leav|ing the other behind, who &s;ent forth &s;uch &s;hrieks as we &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe, as language would be too feeble for the un|dertaking. Upon his coming out of this place, he returned to this rock, and on touching it with one hand it rolled over and entirely &s;hut up the cavity or o|pening in the earth, when all was &s;ilent; he then put on many frightful &s;hapes by turns, till at length he vani&s;hed and was gone.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of our giving the reader a more particular account of this la&s;t appearance was, that we verily believe it to have had great re&s;emblance to a per&s;on re|&s;igning his breath, and having his immortal &s;oul committed by the great Sovereign of the univer&s;e into the hands of the prince of darkne&s;s. Surely it mu&s;t have been the emblem of this, as one of the&s;e forms was the exact pic|ture
<PB N="18" REF="030187_0018_0FE4FD59C8704358">
of one in the agonies of death, as the very image of the immortal &s;oul appeared in open air, near the form of the body with the mon&s;ter, this univer&s;al tyrant receiving and con&s;inging it to this true de&s;cription of end|le&s;s torments.</P>
<P>And &s;ince this was without doubt a repre&s;entation of what we have &s;aid, where &s;hall the wretch be found, &s;o hard and &s;o &s;tupid as to one day more, yea one hour, follow the ways of the devil, however inviting they may appear; for they will &s;urely lead to the death of the immortal &s;oul! Tho' he now &s;miles at thy ways, he will at death appear as he did to us upon this rock (mo&s;t dread|ful) and after groaning life away as the form did, he will, with the &s;ame ferocity, confine the &s;oul in endle&s;s mi&s;ery, and a rock will be rolled to the cavern's mouth, never to be moved.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030187_0019_0FE4FD5B4C9E54D8">During the whole day nothing gave me a greater &s;hock, than to hear the devil &s;ay to Arkins, I will give you the relief you de|&s;erve, as I &s;uppo&s;e he meant by this to make an attempt upon our lives, and his appearing upon the rock as he did &s;eems to con|firm the opinion. Without doubt he intended by this to &s;how us, that he had a will, though he had not power, quickly to de&s;troy our &s;ouls, and confine them in the dark aby&s;s which he repre|&s;ented to us; but heaven be prai&s;|ed, he was not permitted, but &s;ent his way, without executing his plan, and we were conducted to our habitations, rejoicing in the &s;trength of the Lord, and prai&s;|ing his holy name for this won|derful deliverance.</P>
<P>The next morning we related the narrative to our friends, which &s;oon &s;pread thro' the town, and before 12 o'clock there were at
<PB N="20" REF="030187_0020_0FE4FD4CF148D628">
lea&s;t two hundred people collect|ed, with countenances that &s;hew|ed &s;orrow of the deepe&s;t nature, &s;uppo&s;ing it was an appearance that foreboded their de&s;truction, was the appearance real, to con|vince them of which, Arkins &s;hewed them his wounds; but this not being &s;ufficient, we told them that by walking with us in|to Varnum's wood, they would be convinced; upon which four per|&s;ons turned out and went with us, viz. James Erwin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Na|than Cole, Benjamin Guy, and Samuel Ford, to whom we &s;hew|ed the rock which was moved, and which wholly &s;atisfied them as to the truth of it; we then re|turned with the&s;e four men, who told the people that what we had related was without doubt true, as the huge rock was moved (for &s;o it was called) at lea&s;t 12 feet; which when they heard they be|lieved, and we were brought be|fore

them and related the whole affair, with the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between us before we en|tered the wood, which greatly &s;atisfied them, for, &s;aid they, it was to puni&s;h a wicked per&s;on, and not to de&s;troy us, as we im|agined. After the people's fears were abated, Mr. John Boyd, who was preaching in the&s;e parts, and who came to enquire into the matter, called us out, and in the pre&s;ence of all the people &s;aid, "the appearance of the devil is a great and &s;hocking &s;ight to the human mind, yet not &s;o &s;hocking as the &s;ight of one who makes light of it, and can deliberately, when a little out of humour, wi&s;h him to be his companion and gue&s;t: &s;urely the &s;ight of the lat|ter of the&s;e ought to &s;trike us with va&s;tly greater a&s;toni&s;hment than the former. It ought to put each one of us upon &s;trict enqui|ry whether we are wholly free
<PB N="22" REF="030187_0022_0FE4FEB777E470F0">
from &s;uch an abominable charac|ter. All mu&s;t be convinced by what happened ye&s;terday, that the great God takes notice of the words and actions of men, and often in this life gives them what they &s;ay they de&s;ire. And as we know he is a being of ju&s;tice, we may conclude, that tho&s;e who pa&s;s through this life in a cour&s;e of &s;in, and yet go unpuni&s;hed, mu&s;t, when they die, be &s;entenced to that world, where they mu&s;t ev|er remain in un&s;peakable mi&s;ery and de&s;pair. We &s;ee one before us who has been taken at his word, and in a &s;hocking manner wounded by one who he wi&s;hed might attend him. What can he &s;ay? he has had his wi&s;h. Be|hold him and take warning, flee his ways with the greate&s;t abhor|rence. May this be a mean of turning him into the ways of righteou&s;ne&s;s and every one pre&s;|ent, till we &s;hall &s;ay the&s;e are the

<P>After this &s;peech James Ar|kins in pre&s;ence of all the people, came forth, &s;hewed his wounds and with tears in his eyes &s;aid, the&s;e have I received ju&s;tly, and had I received my de&s;erts, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it would have been to &s;uf|fer with the devils to the endle&s;s ages of eternity.
