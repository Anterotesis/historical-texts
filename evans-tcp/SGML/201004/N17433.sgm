<HEAD>THE LIFE OF SIR MATTHEW HALE.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Matthew Hale, a man of great learning and in|tegrity, and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench in the la&s;t century, was born at Alderly, in Glouces|ter&s;hire. November 1, 1609. His grandfather was Robert Hale, an eminent clothier in the &s;ame county, where he and his ance&s;tors had lived for many de&s;cents, and were remarkable for their liberality to the poor. This Robert acquired an e&s;tate of ten thou&s;and pounds, which he divided equally among&s;t his five &s;ons, be|&s;ides the portions be gave his daughters. His &s;econd &s;on was Robert Hale, a Barri&s;ter of Lincoln's Inn, who married Joan, the daughter of Matthew Poyntz, of Alderly, E&s;q. Of this marriage, the great man, the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs, was the only i&s;&s;ue. His father was a man of that &s;trictne&s;s of con&s;cience, that he gave over the practice of the law, becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand the rea&s;on of giving colour in pleadings, which he thought was to tell a lie, and that, with &s;ome other things commonly practi&s;ed, &s;eemed to him contrary to that exactne&s;s of truth and ju&s;tice which became a Chri&s;tian, &s;o that he withdrew him&s;elf from the Inns of Court, to live on his e&s;tate in the country. (A rare in&s;tance! and &s;carcely to be found now-a-days.) But as the care he had to &s;ave his &s;oul made him aban|don a profe&s;&s;ion by which he might have rai&s;ed his family much higher, &s;o his charity made him not only deal his alms largely while he lived, but at his death he left 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. to the poor at Wotton, which his &s;on confirmed to them with &s;ome additions.</P>
<P>Thus he was de&s;cended rather from a good than a noble family; and what was wanting in the in&s;ignifi|cant titles of high birth, and "the boa&s;t of heraldry," was more than made up in the worth of his ance&s;tors. But he was &s;oon deprived of his father's care and in|&s;truction
<PB N="iii" REF="022548_0003_0FB947ECE808B3F8">
&mdash;as his mother died when he was three years old, &s;o his father died when he was no more than five. But as Providence, when it takes one ble&s;|&s;ing from us, or one friend, takes care to rai&s;e up ano|ther for our comfort, &s;o was he taken under the care of Anthony King&s;cot, E&s;q. who was his next kin&s;|man, after his uncles, by his mother.</P>
<P>Great care was taken of his education, and his guardian intended to breed him a Divine, and being inclined to the Puritans, he was put to &s;chools that were taught by that party, and in the &s;eventeenth year of his age he was &s;ent to Magdalen Hall, in Oxford. He was an extraordinary proficient at &s;chool, and for &s;ome time at Oxford; but the players coming thither, by &s;eeing &s;o many plays, he was &s;o much corrupted, that he almo&s;t wholly for&s;ook his &s;tudies, by which he lo&s;t much time, which he was not only &s;en&s;ible of, but found his head filled with vain images of things, which were unprofitable, if not hurtful to him; there|fore he re&s;olved upon coming to London, never to &s;ee a play more; to which he &s;trictly adhered.</P>
<P>The corruption of a young man's mind in one par|ticular, frequently brings on a great many more after it; &s;o now being taken off from following his &s;tudies, and from that gravity which was before his character|i&s;tic, he now &s;et him&s;elf to many of the vanities inci|dent to younger years, but yet he pre&s;erved his purity, and a great probity of mind. He loved fine cloaths, and delighted much in company, and being of a &s;trong and robu&s;t make, he was ma&s;ter of all tho&s;e exerci&s;es which require &s;trength and agility of body. He learned to fence, in which he became &s;o expert, that &s;carcely any could ma&s;ter him in that art. One of his teachers told him one day that he could now in&s;truct him no more, for that he was now better at his trade than he him&s;elf was; this Hale looked upon as flattery, to make a di&s;covery of which, he promi&s;ed him the hou&s;e he lived in (for he was his tenant,) if he would hit
<PB N="iv" REF="022548_0004_0FB947EF99ECBBE8">
him on the head, and bid him do his be&s;t, for he would be as good as his word; after a little engage|ment, the ma&s;ter being really &s;uperior, hit him on the head, and he perfomed his promi&s;e freely. This in|&s;tance &s;hewed a good judgment, and gave &s;ome hopes of better things; and he was not unwilling at that rate to learn &s;o early to di&s;tingui&s;h flattery from truth. He was now &s;o taken up with martial matters, that in&s;tead of being a &s;cholar or divine, he re&s;olved to be a &s;oldier; and his tutor, Obadiah Sedgewick, going to the Low Countries, Chaplain to the renowned Lord Vere, he re&s;olved to go along with him, and to trail a pike in the Prince of Orange's army: but a happy &s;top was put to this re&s;olution, which might have proved fatal to him&s;elf, and deprived his country of the great example he gave, and the u&s;eful &s;ervices he did. He was engaged in a &s;uit of law with Sir William Whitmore, who laid claim to part of his e&s;tate, and his guardian being a man of a retired tem|per, and not made for bu&s;ine&s;s, he was obliged to leave the Univer&s;ity, after he had been three years in it, and go to London to &s;olicit for his own bu&s;ine&s;s. Being recommended to Serjeant Glanvil for his Coun|&s;ellor, and he ob&s;erving in him a clear apprehen&s;ion of things, and a &s;olid judgment, and a great fitne&s;s for the law, took pains to per&s;uade him from being a &s;oldier, and to apply to the law; this had &s;o good an effect on him, that on the eighth of November, 1632, he was admitted into Lincoln's Inn, and being &s;en&s;ible how much time he had lo&s;t, he re&s;olved to redeem it, and followed his &s;tudies with a diligence that &s;carcely could be believed, if the &s;ignal effects of it did not gain it credit. He &s;tudied for many years at the rate of &s;ixteen hours a day; he threw a&s;ide all fine cloaths, and betook him&s;elf to a plain fa&s;hion, which he continued to his dying day. Yet he did not at fir&s;t break off from keeping too much company with &s;ome vain people, till a &s;ad accident drove him
<PB N="v" REF="022548_0005_0FB947F0A04CFF48">
from it; for he and &s;ome other young &s;tudents being invited out of town to be merry, one of them called for &s;o much wine, that notwith&s;tanding all Mr. Hale could do to prevent it, he carried his exce&s;s to &s;uch an height, that he fell down dead before them. They were all much affrighted at it, and did what they could to bring him to him&s;elf again. Mr. Hale was &s;o particularly affected, that he went into another room, fell on his knees, and prayed earne&s;tly to God, both for him&s;elf and friend, that he might be re&s;tored to life again, and be forgiven for giving &s;uch counte|nance to exce&s;s; and he then vowed to God, that he would never again keep company in that manner, nor drink a health while he lived, and he mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved his vow.</P>
<P>This wrought an entire change on him: he now en|tirely for&s;ook all vain company, and divided him&s;elf between the duties of religion, and the &s;tudies of his profe&s;&s;ion; in the former he was &s;o regular, that for thirty &s;ix years time, he never once failed going to church on the Lord's day; this ob&s;ervation he made when an ague interrupted that con&s;tant cour&s;e, and he reflected on it, as an acknowledgment of God's great goodne&s;s to him, in &s;o long a continuance of his health.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with the law books then publi&s;hed, but re&s;olved to take things from the fountain head, he was very diligent in &s;earching records, and with col|lections out of the books he read, together with his own learned ob&s;ervations, he made a mo&s;t valuable common place book. He was early taken notice of by the Attorney General Noy, who directed him in his &s;tudies, and admitted him to &s;uch an intimacy, that he was called by many Young Noy. The great and learned Mr. Selden al&s;o &s;oon found him out, and took &s;uch a liking to him, that he not only lived in great friend&s;hip with him, but made him one of his executors. Mr Selden put him upon a more enlarged pur&s;uit of learning, which he had before confined to
<PB N="vi" REF="022548_0006_0FB947F25C0A2190">
his own profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that he arrived in time to a con|&s;iderable knowledge in the civil law, in arithmetic, algebra, and other mathematical &s;ciences, as well as in phy&s;ic, anatomy, and &s;urgery. He was al&s;o con|ver&s;ant in experimental philo&s;ophy, and other branch|es of philo&s;ophical learning; and in ancient hi&s;tory and chronology. But above all, he &s;eemed to have made divinity his chief &s;tudy, &s;o that tho&s;e who read what he has written upon theological que&s;tions, might be inclined to think, that he had &s;tudied nothing el&s;e. "It is incredible, &s;ays Dr. Burnet, that one man in no great compa&s;s of years &s;hould have acquired &s;uch a variety of knowledge, and that, in &s;ciences which re|quire much lei&s;ure and application. But as his parts were quick, and his apprehen&s;ion lively, his memory great, and his judgment &s;trong, &s;o his indu&s;try was almo&s;t indefatigable. He ro&s;e always betimes in the morning; was never idle; &s;carce ever held any di&s;|cour&s;e about news, except with &s;ome few in whom he entirely confided. He entered into no corre&s;pon|dence by letters, except about nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, or matters of learning, and &s;pent very little time in eat|ing and drinking, for as he never went to public fea&s;ts, &s;o he gave no entertainments but to the poor. He fol|lowed our Saviour's directions, of fea&s;ting none but the&s;e, literally; and in eating and drinking, he ob&s;erved not only great plainne&s;s and moderation, but lived &s;o philo&s;ophically, that he always ended his meal with an appetite; by which he not only lo&s;t little time when he dined, but was fit for any exerci&s;e of the mind immediately after. By the&s;e means he gained a great deal of time, which others for the mo&s;t part wa&s;te unprofitably."</P>
<P>He took a &s;trict account of his time, of which the reader will be&s;t judge by the following &s;cheme he drew for a diary, and which &s;hows, by the im|perfection of the wording of them, they were only

in his dre&s;s, to that of neglecting him&s;elf too much, was once taken by a pre&s;s gang, as a per&s;on fit for the King's &s;ervice; for he was a &s;trong and a well-built man; but &s;ome coming by that knew him, and giving notice who he was, the pre&s;s-men let him go. This made him return to more decency in his cloaths, but never to any &s;uperfinity or vanity in them.</P>
<P>Once as he was buying &s;ome cloth for a &s;uit of cloaths, the draper, with whom he differed about the price, told him, he &s;hould have it for nothing, if he would promi&s;e him an hundred pounds when he came to be Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England; to which he an&s;wered, That he could not with a good con&s;cience wear any man's cloth, unle&s;s he paid for it; &s;o he paid the draper his price; and carried away the cloth; yet the draper lived to &s;ee him ad|vanced to that dignity.</P>
<P>Some time before the civil wars broke out, he was called to the bar, and began to make a figure in the world; but upon their breaking out, ob&s;erv|ing how difficult it was to pre&s;erve his integrity, and yet live &s;ecurely, he re&s;olved to follow tho&s;e two rules of Pomponius Atticus, whom he propo|&s;ed to him&s;elf as a pattern, <HI>viz.</HI> "To engage in no faction, or meddle in public bu&s;ine&s;s, and con|&s;tantly to relieve and favour tho&s;e that were lowe&s;t." He often relieved the royali&s;ts in their nece&s;&s;ities, which &s;o ingratiated him with them, that he was generally employed by them. He was one of the coun&s;el to the Earl of Strafford, Archbi&s;hop Land, and King Charles; as al&s;o to the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, the Lord Capel, and the Lord Craven But being e&s;teemed a plain hone&s;t man, and of great knowledge in the law, he was entertained by both parties. In 1643, he took the covenant, and appeared &s;everal times with other
<PB N="ix" REF="022548_0009_0FB947FCAEA76F88">
lay per&s;ons among the a&s;&s;embly of divines. He was then in great e&s;teem with the Parliament, and employed by them in &s;everal affairs for his coun&s;el, particularly in the reduction of the garri&s;on at Ox|ford; being, as a lawyer, added to the commi&s;&s;i|oners named by the Parliament, to treat with tho&s;e appointed by the King. In that capacity he did good &s;ervice, by advi&s;ing them, e&s;pecially General Fairfax, to pre&s;erve that famous &s;eat of learning from ruin. Afterwards, though he was grieved at Charles's death, he took the oath called the en|gagement; and on the 20th of January, 1651-2, was one of tho&s;e appointed to con&s;ider of the reforma|tion of the law; and Cromwell knowing his great abilities, never le&s;t importuning him, till he ac|cepted of the place of one of the Ju&s;tices of the Common Bench, for which purpo&s;e he was made Serjeant at Law, on January 25, 1653-4. In that &s;tation he acted with integrity and courage. He had at fir&s;t great &s;cruples concerning the authority under which he was to act: and after having gone two or three circuits, he refu&s;ed to &s;it any more on the crown &s;ide. When Cromwell died, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from accepting the mourning that was &s;ent him, and al&s;o refu&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ion offered him by Richard. He did not &s;it in Cromwell's &s;e|cond Parliament in 1656; but in Richard's, which met in January, 1658-9, he was one of the Bur|ge&s;&s;es for the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. In the Heal|ing Parliament in 1660, which recalled King Charles II. he was elected one of the Knights for the county of Glouce&s;ter, and moved that a com|mittee might be appointed to look into the propo|&s;itions that had been made, and the conce&s;&s;ions that had been offered by Charles I. during the late war, and from thence &s;uch propo&s;itions might be
<PB N="x" REF="022548_0010_0FB94801959A74E0">
dige&s;ted, as they &s;hould think &s;it, to be &s;ent over to the King at Breda. The King upon his return recalled him in June to the degree of Serjeant at Law; and upon &s;ettling the Courts in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, con&s;tituted him in November Chief Baron of the Exchequer. When the Lord Clarendon deli|vered him his commi&s;&s;ion, he told him, that "If the King could have found out an hone&s;ter and fit|ter man for that employment, he would not have advanced him to it; and that he had therefore pre|ferred him, becau&s;e he knew none that de&s;erved it &s;o well." It is u&s;ual for per&s;ons &s;o promoted to be Knighted, but he de&s;ired to avoid having that honor done him; which the Lord Chancellor ob|&s;erving, &s;ent for him upon bu&s;ine&s;s one day, when the King was at his hou&s;e, and told his Maje&s;ty there was his mode&s;t Chief Baron; upon which, he was unexpectedly Knighted.</P>
<P>He continued eleven years in that place, mana|ging the court with &s;ingular ju&s;tice. It was ob&s;erved by the whole nation how much he rai&s;ed the repu|tation and practice of it; and tho&s;e who held places in it could declare not only the impartiality of his ju&s;tice, but his genero&s;ity, his va&s;t diligence, and his great exactne&s;s in trials. This gave occa&s;ion to the only complaint ever made of him, "that he did not di&s;patch matters quick enough." But the great care he u&s;ed to put &s;uits to a ju&s;t and final end, made him &s;lower in deciding them,&mdash;&s;o that cau&s;es tried before him were &s;eldom, if ever, tried again.</P>
<P>But it will not &s;eem &s;trange that a Judge behaved him&s;elf as he did, who, at the entry of his em|ployment, &s;et the&s;e excellent rules to him&s;elf, which are copied from his own hand writing.</P>
<P><HI>Things nece&s;&s;ary to be had in continual remembrance.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, I am in|tru&s;ted
<PB N="xi" REF="022548_0011_0FB94803AB24FBA0">
for God, the King, and country; and there|fore,&mdash;2. That it be done, 1. Uprightly. 2. Deli|berately. 3. Re&s;olutely.&mdash;3. That I re&s;t not upon mine own under&s;tanding or &s;trength, but implore and re&s;t upon the direction and &s;trength of God.&mdash;4. That in the execution of ju&s;tice, I carefully lay a&s;ide my own pa&s;&s;ions, and not give way to them, however provoked.&mdash;5. That I may be wholly intent upon the bu&s;ine&s;s I am about, remit|ting all other cares and thoughts as un&s;ea&s;onable, and interruptions.&mdash;6. That I &s;uffer not my&s;elf to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with any judgment at all, till the whole bu&s;ine&s;s and both parties be heard.&mdash;7. That I never engage my&s;elf in the beginning of any cau&s;e, but re&s;erve my&s;elf unprejudiced till the whole be heard.&mdash;8. That in bu&s;ine&s;s capital, though my na|ture prompt me to pity; yet to con&s;ider, that there is a ju&s;tice due to my country.&mdash;9. That I be not too rigid in matters purely con&s;cientious, where all the harm is diver&s;ity of judgment.&mdash;10. That I be not bia&s;&s;ed with compa&s;&s;ion to the poor, or fa|vour to the rich, in point of ju&s;tice.&mdash;11. That the popular or court applau&s;e, or di&s;ta&s;te, have no in|fluence into any thing I do in point of di&s;tributing of ju&s;tice.&mdash;12. Not to be &s;olicitous what men will &s;ay or think, &s;o long as I keep my&s;elf exactly ac|cording to the rule of ju&s;tice.&mdash;13. If in criminals it be a mea&s;uring ca&s;t, to incline to mercy and ac|quittal &mdash;14. In criminals that con&s;i&s;t merely in words, when no harm en&s;ues, moderation is no in|ju&s;tice.&mdash;15. In criminals of blood, if the fact be evident, &s;everity is ju&s;tice.&mdash;16. To abhor all pri|vate &s;olicitations, of what kind &s;oever, and by whom&s;oever, in matters depending.&mdash;17. To charge my &s;ervants, 1. Not to interpo&s;e in any bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="xii" REF="022548_0012_0FB94805790B7C30">
what&s;oever. 2. Not to take more than their known fees. 3. Not to give any undue precedence to cau&s;es. 4. Not to recommend council.&mdash; 18. To be &s;hort and &s;paring at meals, that I may be the fitter for bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He would never receive private addre&s;&s;es or re|commendations from the greate&s;t per&s;ons, in any matter in which ju&s;tice was concerned. One of the fir&s;t Peers in England went once to his chamber, and told him, "That having a &s;uit in law to be tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better under&s;tand it, when it &s;hould come to be heard in court." Upon which the Lord Chief Baron interrupted him, and &s;aid, "He did not deal fairly to come to his chamber about &s;uch affairs, for he never received any infor|mation of cau&s;es but in open court, where both parties were to be heard alike;" &s;o he would not &s;uffer his Grace to go on; &s;o that the Duke went away very much di&s;&s;atisfied, and complained of it to the King as a rudene&s;s that was not to be en|dured.</P>
<P>But his Maje&s;ty bid him content him&s;elf that he was not wor&s;e u&s;ed, and &s;aid, "He verily believ|ed he would have u&s;ed him&s;elf no better, if he had gone to &s;olicit him in any of his own cau&s;es."</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance occurred in one of his cir|cuits, which al&s;o flowed from his exactne&s;s to the rules he had &s;et him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A gentleman had &s;ent him a buck for his table, that had a trial at the a&s;&s;izes; &s;o when he heard his name, he a&s;ked, "If he was not the &s;ame per&s;on who had &s;ent him the veni&s;on?" and finding he was the &s;ame, told him, "he could not &s;uffer the trial to go on, till he had paid him for his buck:" To which the gentleman an&s;wered, "That he never &s;old his veni&s;on, and that he had done nothing to
<PB N="xiii" REF="022548_0013_0FB9480665A44E88">
him, which he did not do to every Judge that had gone that circuit;" which was confirmed by &s;everal gentlemen then pre&s;ent: but all would not do, for the Lord Chief Baron had learned from Solomon, that <HI>"A gift perverteth the ways of judgment;"</HI> and therefore, he would not &s;uffer the trial to go on till he had paid for the pre&s;ent; upon which the gen|tleman withdrew the record. When he was coun|&s;el for Lord Craven, he pleaded with that force of argument, that the then Attorney General, Ed|mund Prideanx, threatened him for appearing again&s;t the government: to whom he an&s;wered, "He was pleading in defence of tho&s;e laws, which they declared they would maintain and pre&s;erve, and he was doing his duty to his client, &s;o that he was not to be daunted with threatenings."</P>
<P>Sir Matthew Hale continued in his office of Lord Chief Baron till the 18th of May, 1671, when on the death of the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, he was pro|moted to that honor. And here he &s;pent the re&s;t of his public life and employment: but about four years and a half after his advancement, he who had hitherto enjoyed a firm and vigorous health, to which his great temperance, and the equality of his mind, did not a little conduce, was on a &s;udden brought very low by an inflammation in his midriff, which in two days broke the con&s;titution of his health to &s;uch a degree, that he never recovered it: he became &s;o a&s;hmatical&punc; that with great diffi|culty he could fetch his breath: that determined in a drop&s;y, of which he afterwards died. He under|&s;tood phy&s;ic &s;o well, that con&s;idering his age, he concluded his di&s;temper mu&s;t carry him off in a lit|tle time; and he therefore re&s;olved to have &s;ome of the la&s;t months of his life to him&s;elf, that being freed from all worldly cares, he might be prepar|ing
<PB N="xiv" REF="022548_0014_0FB9480AC5ECA9A0">
for his change; he was al&s;o &s;o much di&s;abled in his body, that he could hardly, though &s;upported by his &s;ervants walk through We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, or endure the toil of bu&s;ine&s;s: he had been a long time wearied with the di&s;tractions that his employ|ment had brought on him, and his profe&s;&s;ion was become ungrateful to him; he loved to apply him|&s;elf wholly to better purpo&s;es, as will appear by the following paper, which he wrote on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. If I con&s;ider the bu&s;ine&s;s of my profe&s;&s;ion, whether as an advocate, or a judge, it is true, I do acknowledge, by the in&s;titution of Almighty God, and the di&s;pen&s;ation of his providence, I am bound to indu&s;try and fidelity in it: and as it is an act of obedience unto his will, it carries with it &s;omething of religious duty, and I may, and do take comfort in it, and expect a reward of my obedience to him, and the good that I do to mankind therein, from the bounty and beneficence, and promi&s;e of Al|mighty God; and it is true al&s;o, that without &s;uch employments, civil &s;ocieties cannot be &s;upported, and great good redounds to mankind from them, and in tho&s;e re&s;pects, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own indu&s;try, fidelity and integrity in them is a great comfort and &s;atisfaction to me. But yet this I mu&s;t &s;ay concerning the&s;e employments, con&s;idered &s;im|ply in them&s;elves, that they are very full of cares, anxieties, and perturbations.&mdash;2. That though they are beneficial to others, yet they are of the lea&s;t benefit to him that is employed in them.&mdash;3. That they do nece&s;&s;arily involve the party, who&s;e office it is, in great dangers, difficulties, and calum|nies. 4. That they only &s;erve for the meridian of life, which is &s;hort and uncertain.&mdash;5. That though it be my duty faithfully to &s;erve in them, while I am called to them, and till I am duly called from them,
<PB N="xv" REF="022548_0015_0FB9480D189ECBA0">
yet they are great con&s;umers of the little time we have here, which, as it &s;eems to me, might be &s;pent in a pious contemplative life, and a due provi&s;ion for eternity. I do not know a better temporal em|ployment than Martha had, in te&s;tifying her love and duty to our Saviour, making provi&s;ion for him; yet our Lord tells her, "that though &s;he was trou|bled about many things, there was only one thing nece&s;&s;ary, and Mary had cho&s;en the better part."</P>
<P>By this the reader will &s;ee that he continued in his &s;tation upon no other con&s;ideration, but the being &s;et in it by the providence of God, he judged he could not abandon the po&s;t which was a&s;&s;igned him, without prefering his own private inclination to the choice God had made for him: but now that &s;ame Providence, having by this great di&s;temper, di&s;|engaged him from the obligation of holding a place, which he was no longer able to di&s;charge, he re&s;olv|ed to re&s;ign it: this was no &s;ooner &s;urmi&s;ed abroad, than it drew upon him the importunities of his friends, and the clamour of the whole town, to divert him from it, but to no purpo&s;e: &s;o that he made applications to his maje&s;ty for his writ of ea&s;e, which the king was very unwilling to grant him, and offered to let him hold his place &s;till (he doing what bu&s;ine&s;s he could in his chamber); but he &s;aid, "He could not with a good con&s;cience continue in it, &s;ince he was no longer able to di&s;|charge the duties belonging to it."</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty deferred granting his reque&s;t as long as po&s;&s;ible; but at la&s;t having wearied him&s;elf, and all his friends, with his importunate de&s;ires, and growing &s;en&s;ibly weaker in body, he formally &s;ur|rendered his office the 21&s;t of February, 28 Car. 1675-6. He had now nothing to do, but to pre|pare for that change which is equally the lot of all human beings; he returned home with cheerful|ne&s;s,
<PB N="xvi" REF="022548_0016_0FB94810233CB0E0">
and calling all his &s;ervants of office together, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with con&s;iderable pre&s;ents. He lived only to December following; but all the time was &s;o ill, no hopes were given of his recovery; he &s;till continued to retire often, both for his devo|tion and &s;tudies At la&s;t, as the winter came on, he &s;aw, with great joy, his deliverance approaching; for be&s;ides being weary of the world, and his long|ings for the ble&s;&s;ings of another &s;tate, his pains &s;o increa&s;ed, that no patience inferior to his could have borne them &s;o meekly; yet he expre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God, and &s;uch an equal temper under his afflictions, that it was vi&s;ible, what mighty effects his philo&s;ophy and Chri&s;tianity had on him in &s;upporting him under &s;uch a heavy and grievous load.</P>
<P>Not long before his death, the mini&s;ter told him, "There was to be a &s;acrament next Sunday at church, but he believed he could not come and par|take of it; therefore he would give it to him in his own hou&s;e;" but he an&s;wered, "No, his heavenly father had prepared a fea&s;t for him, and he would go to his father's hou&s;e and partake of it," which he, with the help of his &s;ervants, did.</P>
<P>He had &s;ome pre&s;ages of his death, for he &s;aid, if he did not die on a certain day, viz. 25th of November, he &s;hould &s;urvive a month longer; and he died that day month.</P>
<P>He was twice married, fir&s;t to Ann, daughter of Sir Henry More, of Flay, in Berk&s;hire, by whom he had ten children. He out lived them all, except his elde&s;t daughter and younge&s;t &s;on: and &s;econdly to Ann, daughter to Mr. Jo&s;eph Bi&s;hop, of Berk|&s;hire, by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue.</P>

<HEAD>SIR MATTHEW HALE'S EPISTLES TO HIS CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>EPISTLE THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Children,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INTENDED to have been at Al|derly this Whit&s;untide, de&s;irous to renew tho&s;e coun&s;els and advices which I have often given you, in order to your greate&s;t concernment; namely, the everla&s;ting good and welfare of your &s;ouls hereafter, and the due or|dering of your lives and conver&s;ations here.</P>
<P>And although young people are apt, through their own indi&s;cretion, or the
<PB N="2" REF="022548_0018_0FB9481574B9B228">
ill advice of others, to think the&s;e kind of entertainments but dry and empty matters, and the moro&s;e and needle&s;s interpo&s;itions of old men: yet give him leave to tell you, that very well knows what he &s;ays, the&s;e things are of more importance and concernment to you, than external gifts and bounties; where|in, neverthele&s;s, I have not been want|ing to you according to my ability.</P>
<P>This was my intention in this jour|ney; and though I have been di&s;ap|pointed therein, yet I thought good, by letters and me&s;&s;ages, to do &s;ome|thing that might be done that way for your benefit, that I had otherwi&s;e in|tended to have done for your per&s;on.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ure your&s;elves therefore, and be|lieve it from one that knows what he &s;ays; from one that neither can have any rea&s;on or end to deceive you, that the be&s;t gift I can give you, is good coun&s;el; and the be&s;t coun&s;el I can give you, is that which relates to your greate&s;t import and concernment;&mdash; namely, <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>And, therefore, &s;ince I cannot, at
<PB N="3" REF="022548_0019_0FB94817A04D5538">
this time, deliver it to you in per&s;on, I &s;hall do it by this letter; wherein I &s;hall not be very large, but keep my|&s;elf within the bounds proper for a letter; and tho&s;e things only, at this time, which may be mo&s;t of pre&s;ent u&s;e and moment to you: and by your due ob&s;ervance to the&s;e directions, I &s;hall have a good character, both of your dutifulne&s;s to God, your obedience to your father, and al&s;o of your di&s;cre|tion and prudence; for it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that as religion is the be&s;t means to advance and rectify human nature, &s;o no man &s;hall be either truly wi&s;e, or truly happy without it, and the love of it; no, not in this life, much le&s;s in that which is to come.</P>
<P N="1">1. Therefore, every morning and evening, upon your knees, humbly commend your&s;elves to Almighty God in prayer, begging his mercy to pardon your &s;ins, his grace to direct you, his providence to protect you; returning him humble thanks for all his di&s;pen|&s;ations towards you; yea, even for his very corrections and afflictions, intreat|ing
<PB N="4" REF="022548_0020_0FB9481B272FE028">
him to give you wi&s;dom and grace to make a &s;ober, patient, humble, pro|fitable u&s;e of them; and in his due time, to deliver you from them; con|cluding your prayers with the Lord's Prayer. This will be a certain means to bring your mind into a right frame; to procure you comfort and ble&s;&s;ing, and to prevent thou&s;ands of inconve|niences and mi&s;chiefs, to which you will be otherwi&s;e &s;ubjected.</P>
<P N="2">2. Every morning read &s;eriou&s;ly and reverently, a portion of the holy &s;crip|ture, and acquaint your&s;elf with the hi&s;tory and doctrine thereof: it is a book full of light and wi&s;dom, will make you wi&s;e to eternal life, and fur|ni&s;h you with directions and principles to guide and order your life &s;afely and prudently.</P>
<P N="3">3. Conclude every evening with read|ing &s;ome part of the &s;cripture and pray|er in your family.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be &s;trict and religious ob&s;ervers of the Lord's day; re&s;ort to your pari&s;h church twice that day, if your health will permit, and attend diligently and
<PB N="5" REF="022548_0021_0FB9481C2297E560">
reverently to the public prayers and &s;ermons; he cannot rea&s;onably expect a ble&s;&s;ing from God, the re&s;t of the week, that neglects his duty to God, in the due con&s;ecration of this day, to the &s;pecial &s;ervice and duty of God, which this day requires.</P>
<P N="5">5. Receive the Sacrament, at lea&s;t, three times in the year, and oftener, as there is occa&s;ion, in your pari&s;h church. The laws of the land require this, and the law of your Saviour re|quires it, and the law of duty and gra|titude requires it of you. Prepare your&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly for this &s;ervice be|forehand, and perform it with reve|rence and thankfulne&s;s: the neglect of this duty procures great inconveni|ence and &s;trangene&s;s; and commonly the neglect hereof ari&s;eth from &s;ome conceited opinion that people in|con&s;iderately take up; but mo&s;t ordinarily from a &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of mind, and an unwillingne&s;s to fit and prepare the mind for it; or to leave &s;ome &s;inful and vain cour&s;e that men are not willing to leave, and yet con|demn
<PB N="6" REF="022548_0022_0FB9481D9C9CE3E0">
them&s;elves in the practice of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Beware of tho&s;e who go about to &s;educe you from that religion wherein you have been brought up hitherto. It is not unknown to any that ob&s;erves the &s;tate of things in the world, how many erroneous religions are &s;cattered abroad in the world; and how indu&s;|trious men of all per&s;ua&s;ions are to make pro&s;elytes.</P>
<P>And that you may know and ob&s;erve the better, you &s;hall ever find the&s;e artifices practi&s;ed by them: 1. They will u&s;e all flattering applications and in&s;inuations, to be ma&s;ter of your hu|mour, and when they have gotten that advantage, they that &s;eem before to &s;erve you, will then command you. 2. They will u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible &s;kill to rai&s;e in you jealou&s;y and di&s;like towards tho&s;e who may otherwi&s;e continue and keep you in the truth; as to rai&s;e di&s;like in you again&s;t your mini&s;ter; nay, rather than fail, to rai&s;e di&s;&s;ention among re|lations; yea, to ca&s;t jealou&s;ies and &s;ur|mi&s;es among them, if it may be in&s;tru|mental to corrupt them. 3. They will
<PB N="7" REF="022548_0023_0FB94821F4644AE0">
endeavour to withdraw people from the public mini&s;try of God's word, en|courage men to &s;light and neglect it; and when they have once effected this, they have a fair opportunity to infu&s;e their own corrupt principles. 4. They will engage you, by &s;ome means or other, to them; either by &s;ome real, but mo&s;t ordinarily, by &s;ome pretended kindne&s;s or familiarity; that in a little time, you &s;hall not dare to di&s;plea&s;e them; you mu&s;t do and &s;peak what they will have you, becau&s;e &s;ome way or other you are entangled with them, or engaged to them; and then they become your governors, and you will not dare to di&s;obey them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e artifices whereby crafty and &s;ubtle &s;educers gain pro&s;elytes, and bring men under captivity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be very careful to moderate your pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially of choler and an|ger; it inflames the blood, di&s;orders the brain, and, for a time, extermi|nates not only religion, but common rea&s;on; it puts the mind into confu|&s;ion,
<PB N="8" REF="022548_0024_0FB94827624FDBF8">
and throws wild-fire into the tongue, whereby men give others ad|vantage again&s;t them; it renders a man incapable of doing his duty to God, and puts a man upon acts of violence, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and inju&s;tice to men: therefore keep your pa&s;&s;ions under di&s;|cipline, and under as &s;trict a chain as you would keep an unruly ma&s;tiff; look to it, that you give it not too much line at fir&s;t. But if it hath got|ten any fire within you, quench it pre|&s;ently, with con&s;ideration, and let it not break out into pa&s;&s;ionate or unru|ly words and actions; but whatever you do, let it not gangrene into malice, envy, or &s;pite.</P>
<P N="8">8. Send your children early to learn their catechi&s;m, that they take in the true principles of religion betimes, which may grow up with them, and habituate them both to the knowledge and practice of it; that they may e&s;|cape the danger of corruption by error or vice, being antecedently &s;ea&s;oned with better principles.</P>
<P N="9">9. Receive the ble&s;&s;ings of God with
<PB N="9" REF="022548_0025_0FB94828E1BA1438">
very much thankfulne&s;s to him, for he is the root and fountain of all the good you do, or can receive.</P>
<P N="10">10. Bear all afflictions and cro&s;&s;es patiently; it is your duty, for afflicti|ons come not from the du&s;t. The great God of heaven and earth is he that &s;ends the&s;e me&s;&s;engers to you, though po&s;&s;i|bly evil occurrence may be the imme|diate in&s;truments of them: you owe to Almighty God an infinite &s;ubjection and obedience, and to expo&s;tulate with him, is rebellion; and as it is your duty, &s;o it is your wi&s;dom, and your prudence: impatience will not di&s;|charge your yoke, but it will make its gall the wor&s;e, and &s;it the harder.</P>
<P N="11">11. Learn not only patience under your afflictions, but al&s;o profitably to improve them to your &s;oul's good; learn by them how vain and unprofit|able the world, and the plea&s;ures there|of, are, that a &s;harp, or a lingering &s;ickne&s;s renders utterly ta&s;tele&s;s. Learn how vain and weak a thing human na|ture is, which is pulled down to the gates of death, and cloathed with rot|tenne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="022548_0026_0FB9482A782371D8">
and corruption by a little di&s;|order in the blood, in a nerve, in a vein, in an artery. And &s;ince we have &s;o little hold of a temporal life, which is &s;haken and &s;hattered by any &s;mall oc|currence, accident, or di&s;temper: learn to lay hold on eternal life, and of that covenant of peace and &s;alvation, which Chri&s;t hath bought for all that believe, and obey the go&s;pel of peace and &s;al|vation: there &s;hall be no death, no &s;ickne&s;s, no pain, no weakne&s;s, but a &s;tate of unchangeable, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s: and if you thus improve afflictions, you are gainers by it; and mo&s;t certain it is, that there is no more probable way under heaven to be de|livered from affliction, if the wi&s;e God &s;ee it fit, than thus to improve it; for affliction is a me&s;&s;enger, and the rod hath a voice; and that is to require mankind to be the more patient, and the more humble, and the more to ac|knowledge Almighty God in all our ways; and if men li&s;ten to this voice of the rod, and conform to it, the rod, hath done his errand; and will
<PB N="11" REF="022548_0027_0FB9482BDF8AAD30">
either leave a man, or at lea&s;t give a man &s;ingular comfort, even under the &s;harpe&s;t affliction; and this <HI>affliction, which is but for a moment, thus improved, will work for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Reverence your mini&s;ter; he is a wi&s;e, and a good man, and one that loves you, and has a tender care and re&s;pect for you: do not grieve him either by neglect or di&s;re&s;pect. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elves if there be any per&s;on that &s;ets any of you again&s;t him, or provokes or encourageth any of you to de&s;pi&s;e or neglect him, that per&s;on, whoever he be, loves not you, nor the office he bears; and therefore, as the laws of the land, and the Divine Providence, hath placed him at Alderly, to have a care of your &s;ouls; &s;o I mu&s;t tell you, I do expect you &s;hould reverence and honor him for his own, for your, and for his office &s;ake.</P>
<P>And now I have written this long Epi&s;tle to you, to perform that office

<P>I THANK God, I came well to Far|rington this Saturday, about five of the clock: and becau&s;e I have &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="022548_0030_0FB94834DF4D7550">
lei&s;ure time at my inn, I could not &s;pend the time more to my own contentment, and to your benefit, than by my let|ter, to give you all good coun&s;el: the &s;ubject whereof, at this time &s;hall be concerning &s;peech; becau&s;e much of the good or evil that befals per&s;ons, doth occa&s;ionally happen by the well or ill-managing of that part of human conver&s;ation. I &s;hall, as I have lei&s;ure and opportunity, at other times, give you my directions concerning other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>And herein I &s;hall advi&s;e you, fir&s;t, how you are to entertain the &s;peeches of others, according to the divers de&s;ires thereof. Secondly, how you are to manage and order your own &s;peech.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As concerning the former, ob|&s;erve the&s;e directions.</P>

<P>But if they be light, impertinent, vain, pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;ons, their &s;peech is for the mo&s;t part according; and the be&s;t advantage that you will gain by their &s;peech, is but thereby to learn their di&s;po&s;itions, to di&s;cern their fail|ings, and to make your&s;elves the more cautious both in your conver&s;ation with them, and in your own &s;peech and deportment; for in the un&s;eem|line&s;s of their &s;peech, you may di&s;cern and avoid the like in your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2.

If any man &s;peak any thing to the di&s;advantage or reproach of one that is ab&s;ent, be not too ready to be|lieve it, only ob&s;erve and remember it; for it may be, it is not true, or it is not all true, or &s;ome other circum|&s;tances mingled with it, which might give the bu&s;ine&s;s reported a ju&s;tifica|tion, or at lea&s;t an allay, an extenuation, or a rea&s;onable excu&s;e: in mo&s;t actions, if that which is bad alone, or &s;eems to be &s;o, be reported, omitting that which is good, or the circum&s;tances that accompany it, any action may be ea&s;ily mi&s;repre&s;ented; be not too ha&s;ty therefore to believe a reproach, till you know the truth, and the whole truth.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any per&s;on report unto you &s;ome injury done to you by another, either in words or deeds, do not be over-ha&s;ty in believing it, nor &s;udden|ly angry with the per&s;on &s;o accu&s;ed; for po&s;&s;ibly it may be fal&s;e or mi&s;taken;

and how un&s;eemly a thing will it be, when your credulity and pa&s;&s;ion carry you, upon a &s;uppo&s;ed injury, to do wrong to him that hath done you none; or, at lea&s;t, when the bottom and truth of the accu&s;ation is known, you will be a&s;hamed of your pa&s;&s;ion? Believe not a report, till the party accu&s;ed be heard; and if the report be true, yet be not tran&s;ported either with pa&s;&s;ion, ha&s;ty anger, or revenge, for that will be your own torment and perturba|tion: ever, when a per&s;on is accu&s;ed, or reported to have injured you, before you give your&s;elf leave to be angry, think with your&s;elf, why &s;hould I be angry before I am certain it is true? or, if it be true, how can I tell how much I &s;hould be angry till I know the whole matter? Though, it may be, he hath done wrong, yet po&s;&s;ibly it is not &s;o much as is reported, or it was done by mi&s;take, or, it may be, he is &s;orry for it: I will not be angry till I know there be cau&s;e; and if there be a cau&s;e, yet I will not be angry till I know the whole cau&s;e, for till then, if I mu&s;t

be angry at all, yet I know not how much to be angry; it may be, it is not worth my anger, or, if it be, it may be, it de&s;erves but a little. This will keep your mind and carriage, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, in a due temper and order; and will di&s;|appoint malicious or officious tale-bear|ers.</P>
<P N="5">5. If a man, who&s;e integrity you do not very well know, makes you great and extraordinary profe&s;&s;ions and pro|mi&s;es, give him as kind thanks as may be, but give not much credit to it: ca&s;t about with your&s;elf what may be the rea&s;on of this wonderful kindne&s;s; it is twenty to one but you will find &s;omething that he aims at, be&s;ides kind|ne&s;s to you: it may be he hath &s;ome|thing to beg or buy of you, or to &s;ell to you, or &s;ome &s;uch bargain that &s;peaks out, at lea&s;t his own advantage, and not yours; and if he &s;erve his turn of you, or if he be di&s;appointed, his kindne&s;s will grow cold.</P>
<P N="6">6. If a man flatter and commend you to your face, or to one that he thinks will tell you of it, it is a thou|&s;and

<P N="7">7. If a per&s;on be choleric, pa&s;&s;ion|ate, and give you ill language, remem|ber, 1. Rather to pity him, than to be moved into anger and pa&s;&s;ion with him; for mo&s;t certainly, that man is in a di&s;temper and di&s;order; ob&s;erve him calmly, and you &s;hall &s;ee him in &s;o much perturbation and di&s;turbance, that you will ea&s;ily believe he is not a pattern to be imitated by you; and, therefore, return not choler or anger, for angry words; for you do but put your&s;elf in a phren&s;y, becau&s;e you &s;ee him &s;o. 2. Be &s;ure you return not railing, reproaching, or reviling, for reviling, for it doth but kindle more heat, and you will find &s;ilence, or, at lea&s;t, very gentle words, the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite revenge of reproaches that can be; for either it will cure the di&s;temper in the other, and make him &s;ee and be &s;orry for his pa&s;&s;ion, or it will torment

him with more perturbation and di&s;|turbance. But how&s;oever, it keeps your innocence, gives you de&s;erved re|putation of wi&s;dom and moderation, and keeps up the &s;erenity and compo|&s;ure of your mind; whereas pa&s;&s;ion and anger do make a man unfit for any thing that becomes him, as a man, or as a Chri&s;tian.</P>

Some men are excellent in know|ledge of hu&s;bandry, &s;ome of planting, &s;ome of gardening, &s;ome in the ma|thematics, &s;ome in one kind, &s;ome in another: in your conver&s;ation, learn, as near as you can, wherein the &s;kill and excellence of any per&s;on lies, and put him upon talk of that &s;ubject, and ob&s;erve it, and keep it in memory, or writing: by this means, you will glean up the worth and excellence of every per&s;on you meet with, and at an ea&s;y rate put together that which may be for your u&s;e on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="9">9. Conver&s;e not with a liar, or a &s;wearer, or a man of ob&s;cene or wan|ton language; for either he will cor|rupt you, or at lea&s;t it will hazard your

reputation to be one of the like mak|ing; and, if it do neither, yet will fill your memory with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, that will be trouble&s;ome to you in after|time, and the returns of the remem|brance of the pa&s;&s;ages which you long &s;ince heard of this nature, will haunt you when your thoughts &s;hould be bet|ter employed.</P>
<P>Now, as concerning your own &s;peech, and how you are to manage it; &s;omething may be collected out of what goes before, but I &s;hall add &s;ome things el&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let your &s;peech be true; never &s;peak any thing for a truth, which you know, or believe, to be fal&s;e: it is a great &s;in again&s;t God, that gave you a tongue to &s;peak your mind, and not to &s;peak a lie: it is a great offence again&s;t humanity it&s;elf; for where there is no truth, there can be no &s;ociety between man and man; and it is an injury to the &s;peaker; for be&s;ides the ba&s;e di&s;|reputation it ca&s;ts upon him, it doth in time bring a man to that ba&s;ene&s;s of mind, that he can &s;carce tell how to
<PB N="22" REF="022548_0038_0FB94847ED214C88">
tell truth, or to avoid lying, even when he hath no colour of nece&s;&s;ity for it; and in time he comes to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that as another man cannot believe he tells a truth, &s;o he him&s;elf &s;carce knows when he tells a lie; and, ob|&s;erve it, a lie ever returns with di&s;co|very and &s;hame at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. As you mu&s;t be careful not to lie, &s;o you mu&s;t avoid coming near it: you mu&s;t no equivocate; you mu&s;t not &s;peak that ab&s;olutely, which you have but by hear&s;ay or relation; you mu&s;t not &s;peak that as upon knowledge, which you have but by conjecture or opinion only.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let your words be few, e&s;pecially when your betters, or &s;trangers, or men of more experience or under&s;tand|ing, are pre&s;ent; for you do your&s;elf at once two great mi&s;chiefs. 1. You betray and di&s;cover your own weakne&s;s and folly. 2. You rob your&s;elf of that opportunity which you might otherwi&s;e have to gain knowledge, wi&s;|dom, and experience, by hearing tho&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="022548_0039_0FB9484C0B04E858">
that you &s;ilence by your impertinent talking.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be not over earne&s;t, loud, or violent in talking, for it is un&s;eemly; and earne&s;t and loud talking makes you over&s;hoot and loo&s;e your bu&s;ine&s;s; when you &s;hould be con&s;idering and pondering your thoughts, and how to expre&s;s them &s;ignificantly, to the pur|po&s;e, you are &s;triving to keep your tongue going, and to &s;ilence your op|ponent, not with rea&s;on, but with noi&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be careful not to interrupt ano|ther in his talk; hear him out, you will under&s;tand him the better, and be able to give him the better an&s;wer; it may be, if you will give him leave, he will &s;ay &s;omewhat more than you have yet heard, or well under&s;tood, or that which you did not expect.</P>
<P N="6">6. Always before you &s;peak, e&s;peci|ally where the bu&s;ine&s;s is of moment, con&s;ider before hand, weigh the &s;en&s;e in your mind, which you intend to ut|ter, think upon the expre&s;&s;ions you in|tend to u&s;e, that they may be &s;ignifi|cant,
<PB N="24" REF="022548_0040_0FB9484CE0ACA790">
pertinent, and inoffen&s;ive; and whereas it is the ordinary cour&s;e of in|con&s;iderate per&s;ons to &s;peak their words, and then to think, or not to think till they &s;peak: think fir&s;t, and &s;peak after, if it be in any mat|ter of moment or &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be willing to &s;peak well of the ab&s;ent, if you do not know they de|&s;erve ill: by this means you &s;hall make your&s;elf many friends; and &s;ome|times an unde&s;erved commendation is not lo&s;t to the party to whom it is giv|en: I have known &s;ome men, that have met with an unde&s;erved com|mendation, out of &s;hame of being wor&s;e than they have been reported, &s;ecretly to make up practices an&s;wer|able to their commendation, and &s;o to make them&s;elves as good as they are reported.</P>
<P N="8">8. Be &s;ure you give not an ill report to any that you are not &s;ure de&s;erves it; and in mo&s;t ca&s;es, though a man de&s;erves ill, yet you &s;hould be very &s;paring to report him &s;o: in &s;ome ca&s;es, indeed, you are bound, in ho|ne&s;ty
<PB N="25" REF="022548_0041_0FB9484E682D7A08">
and ju&s;tice, to give that account concerning the demerit or default of a per&s;on that he de&s;erves; as, namely, when you are called to give te&s;timony for the ending of a controver&s;y, or when the concealing of it may harden and encourage a per&s;on in an evil way, or bring another into danger; in &s;uch ca&s;es, the very duty of charity binds you to &s;peak your knowledge; nay, your probable fear or &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch a per&s;on, &s;o it be done for prevention of greater inconvenience, and in love; and e&s;pecially if the di&s;covery be made to a per&s;on that hath a &s;uperinten|dance, care, or authority over the per|&s;on complained of; for this is an act of love and duty. But for any per&s;on, maliciou&s;ly, bu&s;ily, and with intent to &s;candali&s;e another, to be whi&s;pering tales and &s;tories to the prejudice of an|other, this is a fault; if you know any good of any per&s;on, &s;peak it as you have opportunity; if you know any evil, &s;peak it, if it be really and prudently done, for the good of him, and the &s;afety of others; otherwi&s;e,

rather choo&s;e to &s;ay nothing, than to &s;ay any thing reproachfully, maliciou&s;|ly, or officiou&s;ly, to his prejudice.</P>
<P N="9">9. Avoid &s;wearing in your ordinary communication, unle&s;s called to it by the magi&s;trate, and not only the gro&s;&s;er oaths, but the le&s;&s;er; and not only oaths, imprecations, earne&s;t and deep prote&s;tations: as you have the com|mendable example of good men to ju&s;|tify a &s;olemn oath before a magi&s;trate, &s;o you have the precept of our Saviour forbidding it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">10. Avoid &s;coffing, and bitter and biting jeering, and je&s;ting, e&s;pecially at your friends' condition, credit, de|formity, or natural defects of any per|&s;on; for the&s;e leave a deep impre&s;&s;ion, and are a mo&s;t apparent inju&s;tice; were you &s;o u&s;ed, you would take it inward|ly ami&s;s; and many times &s;uch an in|jury co&s;ts a man dear, when he little thinks of it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Be very careful, that you give no reproachful, bitter, menacing or &s;piteful words to any per&s;on; nay, not to &s;ervants, or other per&s;ons of an in|ferior

condition; and that upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, 1. There is not the meane&s;t per&s;on but you may &s;tand in need of him in one kind, or at &s;ome time or other; good words make friends, bad words make enemies: it is the be&s;t prudence in the world to make as many friends as you hone&s;tly can, e&s;pecially when it may be done at &s;o ea&s;y a rate as a good word; and it is the greate&s;t folly that can be to make an enemy by ill words, which do not at all any good to the party that u&s;eth them. 2. Ill words provoke ill words again, and commonly &s;uch ill words as are gained by &s;uch a provocation, e&s;pe|cially of an inferior, &s;tick clo&s;er, and wound deeper, than &s;uch as come un|provoked by ill language, or from an equal. 3. Where faults are commit|ted, they may, and by a &s;uperior, mu&s;t be reproved; but let it be done without reproaches, or bitterne&s;s, otherwi&s;e it loo&s;eth its due end and u&s;e, and in|&s;tead of reforming the offence, exa&s;|perates the offender, and makes him wor&s;e, and gives him the cudgel to

&s;trike again, becau&s;e it di&s;covers your own weakne&s;s when you are reprehend|ing another, and lays you ju&s;tly open to his reproof, and makes your own but &s;corned and di&s;e&s;teemed: I pre&s;s this the rather, becau&s;e, mo&s;t ordina|rily, ill language is the folly of chil|dren, and of weak and pa&s;&s;ionate peo|ple.</P>
<P N="12">12. If there be occa&s;ion for you to &s;peak in any company, always be care|ful, if you &s;peak at all, to &s;peak late&s;t, e&s;pecially if &s;trangers are in company; for by this means, you will have the advantage of knowing the &s;en&s;e, judg|ment, temper, and relations of others, which may be a great light and help to you, in ordering your &s;peech; and you will better know the inclination of the company, and &s;peak with more advantage and acceptation, and with more &s;ecurity again&s;t giving offence.</P>
<P N="13">13. Be careful, that you commend not your&s;elves: it is the mo&s;t unu&s;eful and ungrateful thing that can be. You &s;hould avoid flattering of your&s;elves; it is a &s;ign your reputation is &s;mall and
<PB N="29" REF="022548_0045_0FB94855DE6FE2A8">
&s;inking, if your own tongues mu&s;t be your flatterers or commenders; it is a ful&s;ome and unplea&s;ant thing for others to hear it.</P>
<P N="14">14. Abhor all foul, unclean, and ob&s;cene &s;peeches; it is a &s;ign that the heart is corrupt, and &s;uch kind of &s;peeches will make it wor&s;e; it will taint, and corrupt your&s;elves, and tho&s;e that hear it, and brings di&s;repu|tation to tho&s;e that u&s;e it.</P>
<P N="15">15. Never u&s;e any profane &s;peeches, nor make je&s;ts of &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions: when you u&s;e the names of <HI>God,</HI> or of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or any pa&s;&s;ages or words of the holy &s;cripture, u&s;e them with rever|ence and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and not lightly, vainly, or &s;currilou&s;ly, for it is taking the name of God in vain.</P>
<P N="16">16. If you hear of any un&s;eemly ex|pre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in religious exerci&s;es, you mu&s;t be careful to forget, and not to publi&s;h; or if you at all mention them, let it be with pity and &s;orrow, not with deri&s;ion or reproach.</P>
<P N="17">17. Do not upbraid any, or deride any man, for a pious, &s;trict, and reli|gious

of Divine Providence, tho&s;e two great experiments, that God is plea&s;ed to u&s;e &s;ometimes towards the children of men: namely, correction, and deliverance; his rod and &s;taff: and therefore, in all rea&s;onable conjecture, this is the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable time to give you a lecture upon both, and tho&s;e ad|monitions which may render the one and the other profitable to you: and this I &s;hall endeavour to do in the&s;e following lines.</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;hall not need to fear that I intend to upbraid you with the errors of your youth, or to expo&s;tulate with you touching them; for I do a&s;&s;ure you, I do from my heart forgive you all your follies and mi&s;carriages; and I do a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that you have re|pented of them, and re&s;olved again&s;t them for the time to come, and that thereupon God Almighty hath al&s;o ful|ly forgiven what is pa&s;t; and this is a great a&s;&s;urance thereof to me, in that he hath &s;o wonderfully re&s;tored you, and given you, as it were, a new life, wherein you may obey and &s;erve him

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e papers is prin|cipally to commend unto you two ge|neral remembrances, and certain re|&s;ults and collections that ari&s;e from them; they are all &s;ea&s;onable for your pre&s;ent condition, and will be of &s;in|gular u&s;e and benefit to you, in the whole en&s;uing cour&s;e of your life.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would have you, as long as you live, remember your late &s;ickne&s;s in all its circum&s;tances, and the&s;e plain and profitable inferences and advices that ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would have you remember, as long as you live, your great deliver|ance, and the &s;everal circum&s;tances of it, and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary duties that are in|cumbent upon you in relation thereun|to.</P>
<P>It is evident to daily experience, that
<PB N="38" REF="022548_0054_0FB9486A30998F10">
while afflictions are upon us, and while deliverances are fre&s;h, they commonly have &s;ome good effect upon us; but as the iron is no &s;ooner out of the fire, but it quickly returns to its coldne&s;s, and hardne&s;s; &s;o when the affliction or deliverance is pa&s;t, we u&s;ually for|get them, count them common things, attribute them to mean and &s;econd cau&s;es; and &s;o the good, that mankind &s;hould gather from them, vani&s;hes, and men grow quickly to be but what they were before they came; their &s;ick-bed promi&s;es are forgot when the &s;ickne&s;s is over.</P>
<P>And therefore I &s;hall give you an account of your &s;ickne&s;s, and of your recovery: and let them never be for|gotten by you; as often as tho&s;e &s;pots and marks in your face are reflected to your view from the gla&s;s, as often as this paper comes in your &s;ight, nay, as often as you open your eyes from &s;leep, which were once clo&s;ed, and ne|ver likely to open again, &s;o often, and more often, remember your &s;ickne&s;s, and your recovery, and the admoni|tions

<P N="1">1. Therefore, touching your late &s;ickne&s;s, I would have you remember the&s;e particulars. 1. The di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, in its own nature, is now become ordi|narily very mortal, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of your age; look upon even the la&s;t year's general bill of mortality, you will find near two thou&s;and died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inoculation was not introduced into England at that time: this &s;alutary inven|tion was brought from Turkey about 1721, by Lady W.

It was a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, that &s;ecluded the acce&s;s of your neare&s;t relations. 3. Your &s;ickne&s;s rendered you noi&s;ome to your&s;elf, and to all that were about you, and a &s;pectacle full of deformity,
<PB N="40" REF="022548_0056_0FB9486D4ACF8848">
by the exce&s;s of your di&s;ea&s;e beyond mo&s;t that are &s;ick thereof. 4. It was a fierce and violent &s;ickne&s;s: it did not only take away the common &s;upplies of nature, as dige&s;tion, &s;leep, &s;trength, but it took away your memory, your under&s;tanding, and the very &s;en&s;e of your condition, or what might be con|ducible to your good; all that you could do, was only to make your con|dition more de&s;perate in ca&s;e they that were about you had not prevented it, and taken more care for you, than you did or could for your&s;elf. 5. Your &s;ickne&s;s was de&s;perate, in&s;omuch that your &s;ymptoms, and the violence of your di&s;temper, were without example; and you were in the next degree to ab|&s;olute rottenne&s;s, putrefaction, and death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Look upon the foregoing de&s;cription, and remember that &s;uch was your con|dition; you were as &s;ad a picture of mortality and corruption, as any thing, but death it&s;elf, could make: remem|ber it; and remember al&s;o the&s;e en&s;uing in&s;tructions, that may make that re|membrance
<PB N="41" REF="022548_0057_0FB9486EB54632E8">
profitable and u&s;eful to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Remember, that <HI>"Affliction com|eth not forth of the du&s;t, nor doth trouble &s;pring out of the ground."</HI>&mdash;Job v. 6.&mdash; But this terrible vi&s;itation was &s;ent to you from the wi&s;e over-ruling provi|dence of God; it is he that bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up again. It is true, that this di&s;ea&s;e may &s;eem common, but you may, and mu&s;t know, that there was more than the common hand of God in &s;ending it upon you, in &s;uch a manner, and &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, when you were grown up to a compe|tent age and degree of under&s;tanding, to make a due u&s;e of it, that you might &s;ee his ju&s;tice in afflicting you, and his goodne&s;s in delivering you from &s;uch danger.</P>
<P N="2">2 Remember that Almighty God is of mo&s;t infinite wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and mercy; he hath excellent ends in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence: he never &s;ends an affliction, but it brings

a me&s;&s;age with it; his rod has a voice commanding us to &s;earch and try our ways, and to examine our&s;elves whe|ther there hath not been &s;ome great &s;in again&s;t him, or neglect of duty to him; a voice commanding us to re|pent of what is ami&s;s, to be more watchful, circum&s;pect, and obedient to him; in the future cour&s;e of our lives to fear to offend him: and if a man hear this voice, God hath his end of mercy and goodne&s;s; and man hath the fruit, benefit, and advantage of this affliction, and commonly a com|fortable i&s;&s;ue of it; read often and at|tentively the 33d. Job, from the be|ginning to the end.</P>
<P N="3">3. Remember how uncertain and frail a creature man is, even in his &s;eeming &s;tronge&s;t age and con&s;titution of health; even then a pe&s;tilential air, &s;ome evil humour in his blood, &s;ome ob&s;truction, it may be, of a little vein, or artery, a little meat ill-dige&s;ted, and a thou&s;and &s;mall occurrences may, upon a &s;udden, without any con&s;ider|able warning, plunge a man into a de&s;|perate

and mortal &s;ickne&s;s, and bring a man to the grave. Remember, this terrible &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized upon you &s;ud|denly, pulled down your &s;trength quickly, and brought you to the very brink of the grave: and though God hath recovered you, you know not how &s;oon you may be brought into the like condition.</P>
<P N="4">4. Remember, therefore, that you make and keep peace with God, and walk in his fear in the days of health, e&s;pecially after &s;o great a deliverance; and that for many rea&s;ons. 1. You know not whether you may not be o|vertaken with &s;udden death, and then it will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to begin that work. 2. If you have &s;ickne&s;s to give you warning of the approach of death, yet you know not whether that &s;ickne&s;s may not &s;uddenly take away your &s;en&s;es, memory, under&s;tanding, whereby you may be di&s;abled to make your peace with God, or to exerci&s;e any &s;erious thoughts about it. 3. But if that &s;ickne&s;s give you fair warning, and take not away your under&s;tanding,
<PB N="44" REF="022548_0060_0FB9487328B39610">
yet your own experience cannot choo&s;e but to let you know, that pain, and weakne&s;s, and di&s;traction of mind, and impatience, and unquietne&s;s, are the common attendants of a &s;ick-bed, and render that &s;ea&s;on, at lea&s;t, very difficult then to begin that great|e&s;t, and &s;olemne&s;t, and mo&s;t important bu|&s;ine&s;s of a man's life. 4. But if your &s;ick|ne&s;s be not &s;o &s;harp, but that it leaves you patience, and attention of mind for that great bu&s;ine&s;s, how do you know whether your heart &s;hall be inclined to it? Repen|tance and conver&s;ion to God is his gift, though it mu&s;t be our endeavour: and though the merciful God never refu&s;eth a repenting, returning offender; yet, how can a man, that, all the time of his health, hath neglected Almighty God, refu&s;ed his invi|tations, and &s;erved his lu&s;ts and his &s;ins, ex|pect rea&s;onably, that God in the time of &s;ickne&s;s, when the man can &s;erve his &s;ins no longer, will give him the grace of re|pentance?</P>
<P>Whatever you do, therefore, be &s;ure you make peace with God, and keep it in the days of your health, e&s;pecially after &s;o great a deliverance from &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Remember your condition is never &s;o low, but that God hath power to deliver

you, and therefore tru&s;t in him: but re|member withal, that your condition is never &s;o &s;afe and &s;ecure, but you are within the reach of his power to bring you down. You are now, by the mercy of God, reco|vered from a terrible &s;ickne&s;s; think not with your&s;elf that your turn is now &s;erved, and that you &s;hall have no more need of him, and therefore that you may live as you li&s;t, and never regard your duty to him; deceive not your&s;elf herein; remember that this &s;ickne&s;s, within two or three days, brought you upon your knees even from a &s;eeming &s;tate of health: the ca&s;e is the &s;ame &s;till, nay much wor&s;e, if this affliction make you not better; Almighty God cal|led you to love, to &s;erve, and obey him, by the &s;till voice of his word, by the per|&s;ua&s;ion of your friends, by the advices and reproofs of your father: and when the&s;e were not &s;o effectual, as I know you now wi&s;h they had been, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger that &s;peaks louder, that would be heard, even this terrible &s;ickne&s;s; and mo&s;t cer|tainly, if you have heard the voice of this rod, as I am hopeful you have, and there|upon entirely turned to your duty to God in all &s;incerity and obedience, it is the hap|pie&s;t providence that ever befel you; and

you will, upon &s;ound conviction, conclude with the Prophet, <HI>"It was good for me that I was afflicted."</HI> But on the other &s;ide, if notwith&s;tanding this voice of the rod, you &s;hall after your recovery return again to folly, and vanity, and exce&s;s, and har|den your&s;elf again&s;t this me&s;&s;enger; know for certain, you are within the reach of the divine ju&s;tice and power; and if you walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to you, "and puni&s;h you yet &s;even times for your &s;ins." <HI>[Levit.]</HI> Therefore I give you that coun&s;el that our Lord gave to him that he had healed, "Behold thou art made whole, go thy way and &s;in no more, le&s;t a wor&s;e thing befal thee." There is no con|te&s;ting with Almighty God; he is ready and ea&s;y to be reconciled to the wor&s;t of men, upon humiliation and true repentance, but he is not to be ma&s;tered or conquered by ob&s;tinacy and oppo&s;ition: <HI>"Who hath hardened him&s;elf again&s;t him, and pro&s;pered?"</HI> Job ix. 5.</P>
<P N="6">6. I would have you remember, that &s;ickne&s;s, as well as death, doth undeceive mankind, and &s;hows them where their true wi&s;dom lies; when a young man e&s;pecially is in the full career of his vanity and plea|&s;ure, he thinks that religion, and the fear

Therefore I would have you to recollect your&s;elf, and if the violence of your di&s;ea&s;e left you at any time the u&s;e of your rea&s;on, bethink your&s;elf what opinion you then had of intemperance, wa&s;ting of time, un|lawful lu&s;t, or any of tho&s;e &s;ins that for|merly plea&s;ed you in your health, whether they did not appear to you in your &s;ickne&s;s very vain, fooli&s;h, vexing things, &s;uch as you wi&s;hed never to have been committed: and on the other &s;ide, what opinion you had in your &s;ickne&s;s touching piety towards God, hearing of his word, calling upon his name, redeeming of time, mode&s;ty, tem|perance: whether tho&s;e actions of your life pa&s;t, that &s;avoured of the&s;e, were not com|fortable, and contenting to you in your &s;ickne&s;s; whether your purpo&s;es, and pro|mi&s;es, and re&s;olutions of your &s;ick-bed, were not full of &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e: if it plea&s;e God to recover me, I will never be &s;uch a fool as I have been: I will never drink to exce&s;s, mi&s;pend my time; I will

Remember, that although great deli|verances require your great acknowledg|ments, yet there is &s;omewhat more required; namely, a real, practical glorifying of God, by ordering your conver&s;ation aright, by &s;erving him, plea&s;ing him, obeying him, liv|ing to his honor: this Almighty God ex|pects, as well as prai&s;es, and acknowledg|ments; as the end of God in afflictions is
<PB N="55" REF="022548_0071_0FB9488A6EC20FF0">
to make men better; &s;o the end of God in deliverances is to make men better; and if we are not the better men by both di&s;pen&s;a|tions, we do, as much as in us lies, di&s;ap|point Almighty God in his de&s;ign, and di&s;|appoint our&s;elves of the benefit and advan|tage intended in both, and ea&s;ily to be gained by both. This therefore is the voice of this deliverance, it calls &s;weetly, and gently indeed, but earne&s;tly, and effec|tuall, for amendment of life, and that upon two great and moving arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your recovery, and great deliverance, calls for this from you, upon the account of common ingenuity and good nature, which obligeth a man to be ob&s;ervant and dutiful to his benefactor. God Almighty is the greate&s;t benefactor, and hath manife&s;ted him&s;elf &s;uch to you, upon a vi&s;ible eminent account; this is engagement enough, upon the account of common humanity, to be dutiful and obedient to him; when there|fore you are at any time, by the temptation of your own corruption, or by the &s;olicita|tion of evil per&s;ons, &s;olicited to evil actions, con&s;ider thus with your&s;elf;&mdash;is this a be|coming return to that God, that hath thus wonderfully delivered me? is this the requit|al that I &s;hall make unto him for his mercy? &s;hall I plea&s;e the great God of heaven and
<PB N="56" REF="022548_0072_0FB9488BE31C9A08">
earth, that hath thus delivered me, and done me more good than all the world could ever do me, or than I can ever recompen&s;e? <HI>"Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye fooli&s;h people, and unwi&s;e? hath he not made thee, and e&s;tabli&s;hed thee?</HI> Deut. xxxiii.</P>
<P N="2">2. This his mercy calls for your obedience to God in an eminent manner upon the ac|count of common prudence and di&s;cretion; the benefit of your obedience to him will be your own, your own happine&s;s in this life, and in that to come; there is no greater moral &s;ecurity again&s;t future dangers and troubles, than obedience and reformation of life, upon great deliverances received; nor is there any greater invitation of new troubles and mi&s;chiefs than ingratitude, di&s;obedience, and great &s;ins after great mer|cies and deliverances; there is a kind of cer|tain and infallible connexion, between great &s;ins, after great mercies received, and great judgments to follow; <HI>Ingentia beneficia, ingentia peccata, ingentia &s;upplicia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Great favours, followed by great crimes, are &s;uc|ceeded by great puni&s;hments.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Again, as I have formerly told you, you do not know how &s;oon you may &s;tand in need of the &s;ame mercy and goodne&s;s of God, which you have formerly found; you are never out of the reach of his power, and
<PB N="57" REF="022548_0073_0FB9488D62D81310">
the nece&s;&s;ity of his help; whatever you do, therefore, never di&s;oblige him by whom you live, and who&s;e extraordinary mercy you may &s;tand in need of, you know not how &s;oon; there is nothing in the world doth more provoke God than neglect, for|getfulne&s;s, or wilful di&s;obedience after &s;ignal mercies; the&s;e provoke the merciful God to a &s;everity of the highe&s;t kind, be|cau&s;e the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t obliging call of mercy and deliverance is neglected; read the fir&s;t chapter of the Proverbs attentively. And the merciful God hath given us a plain rule and method, how he may be &s;erved, obeyed, and plea&s;ed; he hath given us a plain di&s;covery of his will in the Scriptures of both Te&s;taments; read that often, you have it by you, and you need not go far to find what is your Maker's will, and what that obedience is that he requires, as the return of this, and all other his mercies; yet I think it not ami&s;s to mind you of &s;ome particulars, that may be u&s;eful for you upon this occa&s;ion, and to direct you how parti|cularly to improve it, and &s;o order your fu|ture life in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would have you make it your fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, after your recovery, to con&s;ider the cour&s;e of your life pa&s;t, &s;ince you came
<PB N="58" REF="022548_0074_0FB9488EE664B858">
to the age of di&s;cretion, and &s;ee what hath been ami&s;s in it; whether you have not ne|glected religion, and the duties of it, too much, as prayer, hearing the word preach|ed, ob&s;erving the Lord's day, receiving the Sacrament, whether you have not been guilty of intemperance, exce&s;s of drinking, wantonne&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, idlene&s;s, mi&s;pend|ing your time, and tho&s;e &s;upplies which have been allowed for your maintainance; whether you have not too much delighted in vain, &s;inful, and di&s;orderly compa|ny, vanity and expen&s;e in apparel; and if &s;uch, or the like faults have been, repent of them; be &s;orry for them, re&s;olve again&s;t them; and let the future cour&s;e of your life be amended in relation thereunto. I have before told you that your heavenly Father hath forgiven you, and I have for|given you, neither do I mention tho&s;e things to upbraid you for them, but that you, upon the con&s;ideration of what hath been ami&s;s, may be thereby the better enabled to rectify and &s;et in order your fu|ture life; if this be done and practi&s;ed, I will reckon your late &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;temper one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings that ever befel you.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would have you always keep a ha|bit of the fear of God upon your heart;
<PB N="59" REF="022548_0075_0FB948920A1C39F0">
con&s;ider his pre&s;ence, order your life as in his pre&s;ence; con&s;ider that he always &s;ees you, beholds and takes notice of you, and e&s;pecially whether you carry your&s;elf an|&s;werable to this great deliverance: it is one of tho&s;e talents for which he will expect an account from you.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would have you frequently and thank|fully con&s;ider of the great love of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath given to be the in&s;tructor and governor, and &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of you and all mankind: through whom, upon repentance, you have a&s;&s;ur|ance of the remi&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins, and eter|nal life: and frequently con&s;ider how great an engagement this is upon you, and all mankind, to live according to &s;uch a hope, and &s;uch a mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would have you every morning read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, till you have read the bible from the beginning to the end: ob&s;erve it well, read it reverently and attentively, &s;et your heart upon it, and lay it up in your memory, and make it the direction of your life; it will make you a wi&s;e and good man: I have been acquaint|ed &s;omewhat with men and books, and have had long experience in learning, and in the world: there is no book like the bible for excellent learning, wi&s;dom, and u&s;e: and
<PB N="60" REF="022548_0076_0FB948935FFD02B8">
it is the want of under&s;tanding, in them that think or &s;peak otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. Every morning and every evening, upon your knees, with all reverence and at|tention of mind, return hearty thanks to God for his mercy to you, and particularly for this deliverance; de&s;ire his grace to ena|ble you to walk in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable to it; beg his providence to protect you, his grace to direct you, to keep you from evil actions, and evil per&s;ons, and evil oc|currences; beg his pardon for your &s;ins, and the continuance of his favour; always concluding with the Lord's prayer.</P>
<P N="6">6. Ob&s;erve con&s;cientiou&s;ly the Lord's day to keep it holy; avoid idle company, idle di&s;cour&s;e, recreations, and &s;ecular employ|ment, upon that day; re&s;ort that day twice to the public prayers and &s;ermon; go early to it, be attentive at it, and keep your eyes and mind from roving after vain thoughts or objects; &s;pend the re&s;t of that day, that is free from nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, in reading the Scriptures or &s;ome good books of di|vinity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Once every term, at lea&s;t, come pre|paredly and reverently to the Holy Commu|nion, receive it with great reverence and thankfulne&s;s, and due con&s;ideration to the
<PB N="61" REF="022548_0077_0FB94894DFA7F160">
end of its in&s;titution; renew your covenant with Almighty God, that you made in bap|ti&s;m, and live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly before him, and beg his grace and &s;trength to perform it.</P>
<P>And as tho&s;e directions before do more e&s;pecially relate to Almighty God, and your deportment immediately towards him; &s;o the&s;e that follow, more e&s;pecially relate to your&s;elf and others, and your moral con|ver&s;ation. Therefore,</P>
<P N="8">8. Be very moderate in eating and drink|ing; drunkenne&s;s is the great vice of the time; and by drunkenne&s;s, I do mean, not only gro&s;s drunkenne&s;s, but al&s;o tippling, drinking exce&s;&s;ively or immoderately, or more than is convenient, and nece&s;&s;ary; avoid tho&s;e companies that are given to it; come not into tho&s;e places that are devoted to that bea&s;tly vice, namely, taverns and ale-hou&s;es; avoid and refu&s;e tho&s;e devices that are u&s;ed to occa&s;ion it, as drinking and pledging of healths: be re&s;olute again&s;t it, and when your re&s;olution is once known, you will never be &s;olicited to it. The Re|chabites were commanded by their father not to drink wine, and they obeyed it, and had a ble&s;&s;ing for it: my command to you is not &s;o &s;trict; I allow you the moderate
<PB N="62" REF="022548_0078_0FB948965E6C8360">
u&s;e of wine and &s;trong drink at your meals; I only forbid you exce&s;s, or the unnece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of it, and tho&s;e places and companies and artifices, that are temptations to it.</P>
<P N="9">9. Avoid wanton and la&s;civious ac|tions, &s;peeches, and company: read pro|verbs ii. 5, 6, 7, 9. An harlot hunts for the precious life of a man, and that vice brings a ruin with it to the &s;oul, body, and e&s;tate: if you cannot conveniently contain your&s;elf in a &s;ingle life, and be of competent health, marry, but with the ad|vice and coun&s;el of your father while he lives.</P>
<P N="10">10. Be frugal of your time, it is one of the be&s;t jewels we have; and to that end avoid idlene&s;s, it con&s;umes your time, and lays you open to wor&s;e inconveniences; let your recreations be healthy, and creditable, and moderate, without too much expen&s;e of time or money; go not to plays, they are wa&s;ting of time; value time by that e&s;timate we would have of it, when we want it; what would not a &s;ick man give for tho&s;e portions of time, and health, that he had formerly improvidently wa&s;ted?</P>
<P N="11">11. Be diligent in your &s;tudy and call|ing; it is an act of duty to Almighty God, that requires it, and it will be your wi&s;dom and benefit; and it will be a good expen&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="022548_0079_0FB9489A29882420">
of time, a prevention from a thou&s;and in|conveniencies and temptations that other|wi&s;e will befal a man; it will furni&s;h you with knowledge and under&s;tanding, give you the advantage and means of a comfort|able and plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and make you a &s;upport, comfort, and benefit to your friends and country.</P>
<P N="12">12. Be frugal in your expen&s;es; live within the compa&s;s of that exhibition that God's providence, and your father's abi|lities &s;hall &s;upply you withal; it is enough to maintain an hone&s;t provident man, and ten times more will not be enough to a profu&s;e mind; a frugal man will live com|fortably, and plentifully, upon a little, and a profu&s;e man will live beggarly, nece&s;|&s;itou&s;ly, and in continual want, whatever his &s;upplies be.</P>
<P N="13">13. In all your expen&s;es, con&s;ider before hand; can I not be well enough without this that I am about to buy? is there an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it? can I not forbear till I am in a better condition to compa&s;s it? If I buy or borrow, can I pay&mdash;and when?&mdash;and am I &s;ure?&mdash;will this expen&s;e hold out?&mdash;how &s;hall I bring about the next quarter, or the next year?&mdash;If young men would but have the patience to con&s;i|der,
<PB N="64" REF="022548_0080_0FB9489ADBB7E6C8">
and a&s;k them&s;elves que&s;tions of the like nature, it would make them con&s;iderate in their expen&s;es, and provident for the future; and the&s;e con&s;iderations will, in an e&s;pecial manner, concern you, in re&s;pect of your father's expen&s;es for you, which though I have forgiven and forgotten, I would have you remember with gratitude and caution.</P>
<P N="14">14. The vanity of young men, in loving fine cloaths and new fa&s;hions, and valuing them&s;elves by them, is one of the mo&s;t childi&s;h pieces of folly that can be, and the occa&s;ion of great profu&s;ene&s;s and undoing of young men. Avoid curio&s;ity and too much expen&s;ivene&s;s in your apparel: be comely, plain, decent, cleanly&mdash;not curi|ous or co&s;tly:&mdash;it is the &s;ign of a weak head-piece, to be &s;ick for every new fa&s;hion, or to think him&s;elf the better in it, or the wor&s;e without it.</P>
<P N="15">15. Be careful, what company you con|&s;ort with&mdash;and much more careful, what per&s;ons you grow intimate with. Choo&s;e &s;ober, wi&s;e, learned, hone&s;t, religious com|pany:&mdash;you will gain learning and wi&s;dom, and improve your&s;elf in learning and good|ne&s;s, by conver&s;ing with them:&mdash;but avoid debauched, fooli&s;h, intemperate, prodigal, athei&s;tical, profane company, as you would
<PB N="65" REF="022548_0081_0FB948A092DD4110">
avoid the plague:&mdash;they will corrupt and undo you:&mdash;they are a &s;ort of the mo&s;t pi|tiful fools in the world; and familiar ac|quaintance and conver&s;ation with them will endanger to make you like them.</P>
<P N="16">16. Weigh and con&s;ider your words be|fore you &s;peak them; and do not talk at random or at a venture. Let your words be few, and to the purpo&s;e:&mdash;be more ready to hear others, than to &s;peak your&s;elf:&mdash;ac|cu&s;tom your&s;elf to &s;peak lei&s;urely and deli|berately:&mdash;it will be a means to make you &s;peak warily and con&s;iderately.</P>
<P N="17">17. Be very careful to &s;peak truth; and beware of lying. As lying is di&s;plea&s;ing to God, &s;o it is offen&s;ive to man; and al|ways, at the latter end, returns to the re|proach or di&s;advantage of him that u&s;eth it:&mdash;it is an evidence of a weak and un|manly mind. Be careful that you believe not ha&s;tily &s;trange &s;tories; and be much more careful that you do not report them, though at the &s;econd hand:&mdash;for, if it prove an untruth, as commonly &s;trange &s;tories prove &s;o, it brings an imputation of levity upon him that reports it, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome di&s;advantage to others.</P>
<P N="18">18. Take heed, what you promi&s;e:&mdash; &s;ee that it be ju&s;t, and hone&s;t, and lawful,
<PB N="66" REF="022548_0082_0FB948A35B2A1230">
and what is in your power hone&s;tly and cer|tainly to perform: and when you have &s;o promi&s;ed, be true to your word. It is, for the mo&s;t part the fa&s;hion of incon&s;iderate and young men, e&s;pecially that run in debt; they will, with great a&s;&s;everations, promi&s;e preci&s;e payment at this day, or that day, when either they certainly know they can|not perform, or at lea&s;t have no probable a&s;&s;urance that they can do it; and when their turn is &s;erved, they are as backward in their performance, as they were before liberal in their promi&s;es. Breach of pro|mi&s;es, and lying, are much of a nature, com|monly go together, and are arguments of an impotent and unmanly mind.</P>
<P N="19">19. Beware of gaming; it is the &s;udden|e&s;t con&s;umption of an e&s;tate that can be, and that vice &s;eldom goes alone; commonly debauchery of all kinds accompanies it: be&s;ides it makes a man of a wild, va&s;t, and un&s;ettled mind; and &s;uch men are impatient of an hone&s;t calling, or of moderate or ho|ne&s;t gain.</P>
<P N="20">20. Run not in debt, either for wares &s;old, or money borrowed; be content to want things that are not of ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity, rather than to run upon the &s;core; &s;uch a man pays at the latter end, one third part more than the principal comes to, and
<PB N="67" REF="022548_0083_0FB948A4AB25D660">
is in perpetual &s;ervitude to his creditors, lives uncomfortably, is nece&s;&s;itated to in|crea&s;e his debts, to &s;top his creditors' mouths, and many times falls into de&s;perate cour&s;es.</P>
<P N="21">21. Be re&s;pectful to all, familiar and inti|mate with few: be grateful to your bene|factors, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who, under God, were in&s;trumental for your good, in your late &s;ickne&s;s, and return your thanks to them; to your father, that &s;pared no co&s;t for your recovery; to your doctor, that was exceedingly diligent about you; to tho&s;e that attended you in your &s;ickne&s;s; to tho&s;e that, together with your father, often pray|ed to God for your recovery, and for a ble&s;|&s;ing upon this affliction, who&s;e names you &s;hall, in due time, particularly know; but above all, to Almighty God, who not only provided and ble&s;&s;ed the means, but &s;aved and delivered you above all means and when means failed.</P>
<P N="22">22. La&s;tly, I &s;hall conclude with one ad|vice more, without the ob&s;ervance whereof, my labour in writing this long epi&s;tle will be probably fruitle&s;s: be not wi&s;e in your own conceit; this is the unhappy error, and many times the ruin of young men e&s;peci|ally; they are u&s;ually ra&s;h, giddy, and in|con&s;iderate, and yet extremely confident of
<PB N="68" REF="022548_0084_0FB948A623F4B640">
that which they have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to tru&s;t; namely, their own under&s;tanding, which renders them mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">erved from them that are willing and be&s;t able to advi&s;e them, impatient of reproof, love to be flattered, and &s;o become incapable of good and wi&s;e coun&s;el, till their follies have reduced them to extreme &s;traits and inconveniencies; &s;u&s;|pect therefore your own judgment: advi&s;e often with your father, e&s;pecially in all things of moment; be glad of coun&s;el, and be contented and willing to follow it; at lea&s;t till ripene&s;s of age, ob&s;ervation, and experience have enabled you to advi&s;e your|&s;elf; this is an ea&s;y, and ready, and cheap way of attaining wi&s;dom, and avoiding infinite inconveniencies.</P>
<P>And thus I have in this long epi&s;tle, given you the means how you may improve both your own &s;ickne&s;s, and recovery, to the glory of God, and your own benefit. I &s;hall therefore conclude with two con&s;ider|ations that may the more engage you to the u&s;e of both the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P N="1">1. The danger is great, if afflictions make not a man more humble and dutiful; and the danger is yet greater, if any great de|liverances and mercies do not make a man more thankful and obedient to God; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="022548_0085_0FB948A819527F88">
it is the mo&s;t obliging method that the gracious God can u&s;e towards the chil|dren of men for that end, in this life; and the neglect of that invitation adds ingrati|tude and contempt to the neglect of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The benefit that you will receive by making a good u&s;e of the&s;e two di&s;pen&s;a|tions, in improving your dutifulne&s;s and obedience to God, will be &s;ingular and ex|cellent. 1. It will make you a wi&s;e man, by making you a good and religious man: believe it from your father, who will not deceive you; nay, believe it from a greater than your father, the very Spirit of Truth, who cannot deceive you; the true fear of God, is the only true wi&s;dom: Read Deut. iv. 6; Job xxvii. 28; P&s;alm cxi. 10; Prov. i. 7; Prov. ix. 10; Eccls. xii. 13; and very many more declarations there are of this great truth. 2. It will make you a happy man, it will give you the favour and love of God, which is better than life it|&s;elf: you &s;hall have his mercy to pardon you, his providence to protect you, his wi&s;|dom to direct you, his goodne&s;s to ble&s;s you, and to forgive and to forget whatever hath heretofore been done ami&s;s by you: this will make all conditions comfortable to you; whether life or death, &s;ickne&s;s or

health: by this means you may be a com|fort to your father, a &s;upport to your bro|thers and &s;i&s;ters, an in&s;trument of good to your country, and attain an hone&s;t, cre|ditable, and competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in this world, and an everla&s;ting inheritance of glory and immortality in the world to come.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you a large letter of found and good coun&s;el: &s;et your heart to it, and ob&s;erve and remember it: we &s;ee how un&s;table our lives are; you nor I know not how &s;oon either, or both of us, may leave this world: it may be, this may be the la&s;t paper of advice that your father may give you; but however it &s;hall plea&s;e God to deal with you or me, touching our conti|nuance in this world, yet let me leave this with you, in the clo&s;e of this letter; if I &s;hall find that the&s;e directions are dutifully ob&s;erved, I &s;hall be ready, from time to time, freely to advi&s;e and direct you: and as I have pa&s;&s;ed by your former extravagances, &s;o I &s;hall hereby have great a&s;&s;urance, that God hath ble&s;&s;ed this vi&s;itation to you. But on the other &s;ide, if I &s;hall find that you neglect my coun&s;els, that you make light of them, that you &s;till pur&s;ue tho&s;e cour&s;es, that will certainly be bitterne&s;s in the end, I mu&s;t then tell you, I &s;hall pray

<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e it hath plea&s;ed God to ca&s;t my lot &s;o, that I am to re&s;t at this place upon that day, and the con&s;ideration there|fore of that duty is proper for me and you: it is <HI>opus diei in die &s;uo,</HI> the work fit and proper for that day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e I have found by long and &s;ound experience, that the due ob&s;ervance of this day, and of the duties of it, hath been of &s;ingular comfort and advantage to me; and I doubt not but it will prove &s;o to you. God Almighty is the Lord of our time, and lends it to us; and it is but ju&s;t we &s;hould con&s;ecrate this part of that time to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e I find in the world much loo&s;ene&s;s and apo&s;tacy from this duty. Peo|ple begin to be cold and carele&s;s in it, al|lowing them&s;elves &s;ports and recreations and &s;ecular employments in it, without any nece&s;&s;ity; which is a &s;ad &s;pectacle and an ill pre&s;age. It concerns me therefore (that am your father) as much as I may, to res|cue
<PB N="73" REF="022548_0089_0FB948ADB19E9F18">
you from that &s;in, which the example of others, and the inclination and incon&s;i|deratene&s;s of youth, is otherwi&s;e apt to lead you into.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore &s;et down to you parti|cularly (and not in generals only) the&s;e things&mdash;1. What is the rea&s;on and ground of your ob&s;ervation of this day. 2. What things ought not to be done up|on this day, which po&s;&s;ibly may be law|ful upon another day. 3. What things may be done upon this day. 4. What things are either fit or nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in or+der to the &s;anctification of this day.</P>
<P>Touching the fir&s;t of the&s;e, viz. The rea|&s;on of the ob&s;ervation and &s;anctification of this day:&mdash;and the rea&s;ons are the&s;e:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a moral duty, that, &s;ince the glo|rious God gives me my time, I &s;hould con|&s;ecrate and &s;et apart &s;ome portion of that time, in a &s;pecial manner, to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="2">2. And becau&s;e the glorious God be&s;t knows, what portion of time is fit to be peculiarly dedicated to his &s;ervice, that &s;o the morality of that time might be deter|mined unto &s;ome certainty, he hath, by his expre&s;s precept, given to his ancient peo|ple, the Jews, limited one day of &s;even, to be that &s;pecial portion of time, which he
<PB N="74" REF="022548_0090_0FB948AF93572C00">
would have peculiarly dedicated to his &s;er|vice, and &s;o to conclude into it the mora|lity of that duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;eventh portion of time, under the old law given to the Jews, was deter|mined by the precept and command of God, in the fourth command; and likewi&s;e by his own example, confined to the &s;eventh day from the creation.</P>
<P N="4">4. But our &s;aviour, Chri&s;t, who is the &s;on of God, ble&s;&s;ed for ever, and is the Lord of the Sabbath, [<HI>Matt.</HI> xii.] fulfill|ing the work of our redemption, by his re|&s;urrection upon the fir&s;t day of the week, and by his mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t mi|raculou&s;ly the fir&s;t day of the week, and by the &s;ecret me&s;&s;age of the &s;pirit to the apos|tles and primitive church, hath tran&s;lated the ob&s;ervation of the &s;eventh day of the week, to the fir&s;t day of the week, which is our Chri&s;tian Sabbath.</P>
<P>Concerning the &s;econd&mdash;It is certain that what is unlawful to be done upon an|other day, is much mo&s;t unlawful upon this; as exce&s;s and intemperance, and the like &s;inful and unlawful actions. But fur|ther, there are many things, that may be lawfully done on another day, which may not lawfully be done upon this; and many
<PB N="75" REF="022548_0091_0FB948B0AAFD66D0">
that are not only lawful upon another day, but al&s;o fit and decent, which are yet un|fit to be done upon this day. Upon other days we may and mu&s;t employ our&s;elves in our &s;ecular and ordinary callings&mdash;we may u&s;e bodily exerci&s;es and recreations, as bowl|ing, &s;hooting, hunting, and divers others&mdash; we may &s;tudy human learning:&mdash;but I hold the&s;e to be not only unfit, but unlawful to be u&s;ed upon this day: and therefore re|member it. Moderate walking may thus far be u&s;ed, &s;o far only, as it enableth you to the more cheerful performance of the duties of this day: and therefore I allow you to walk &s;oberly, about half an hour after din|ner, to dige&s;t your meat, that you be not drow&s;y nor indi&s;po&s;ed, in the religious du|ties of the day. Fea&s;tings may be &s;ea&s;on|ably u&s;ed &s;ometimes upon other days, but are unfit upon this. Let only &s;uch provi|&s;ion be made upon this day, as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the family and the poor: and therefore I hold, that curio&s;ities, baking of meats, and &s;uperfluous provi&s;ions, upon this day, are to be avoided, as being an unne|ce&s;&s;ary breaking of the re&s;t of this day, and unbe&s;eeming the &s;olemnity of it.</P>
<P>Thirdly,&mdash;What things may be done this day, is a que&s;tion of great latitude; becau&s;e
<PB N="76" REF="022548_0092_0FB948B22E4A7E90">
circum&s;tances are many, that do much di|ver&s;ify the actions of men, and many times render them lawful or unlawful, according to tho&s;e varieties of circum&s;tances. There|fore I &s;hall &s;hortly &s;et down tho&s;e things, that do not of them&s;elves directly tend to the &s;anctitication of this day, that yet may, and &s;ometimes mu&s;t, be done upon this day. For there were many things, that were &s;trictly enjoined to the Jews in their ob&s;er|vation of the Sabbath, which were ceremo|nial, and concerned only that &s;tate, and do not oblige under the go&s;pel; as their dre&s;s|ing meat upon this day was prohibited to them, but not to us: and many more things they did forbear and count unlawful, which in truth were not only not forbidden, but enjoined and commanded;&mdash;for which our Lord reproves the Phari&s;ees, who account|ed it a breach of the Sabbath, to heal the &s;ick, or to pluck the ears of corn for neces|&s;ary relief of hunger. <HI>Mat.</HI> xii.</P>
<P>Therefore&mdash;1. Works of ab&s;olute neces|&s;ity, for man or bea&s;t, may be done upon the Lord's day. And tho&s;e I call works of nece&s;&s;ity, which cannot be done before this day, or after, without apparent dan|ger; as, for in&s;tance, &s;topping of the breach of a &s;ea-wall&mdash;&s;upporting a hou&s;e, that,
<PB N="77" REF="022548_0093_0FB948B39C8C1718">
upon a &s;udden tempe&s;t or ca&s;ualty, is ready to fall&mdash;pulling out an ox or other bea&s;t, fallen into a ditch&mdash;preventing of a tre&s;pa&s;s, by a &s;udden accident, that may be occa&s;i|oned to my corn, or my neighbour's&mdash;&s;et|ting of a broken bone&mdash;phy&s;ic to remove an imminent di&s;ea&s;e or pain&mdash;milking of cows&mdash;feeding of cattle&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ary dre&s;&s;ing of meat for the family&mdash;and many more in&s;tances of that kind. But yet there in warine&s;s and integrity mu&s;t be u&s;ed; for otherwi&s;e men, under the pretence of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, will take the liberty to do what they plea&s;e. Therefore take the&s;e cautions con|cerning nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="1">1. That is not a nece&s;&s;ity, that excu&s;eth a work upon this day, which might have been rea&s;onably fore&s;een and done before the day; as, for in&s;tance, a man hath a ne|ce&s;&s;ity to dre&s;s meat for his family, which he might have provided on the Saturday; and neglects it:&mdash;this nece&s;&s;ity will not ju&s;tify him in &s;ending two or three miles to buy meat on the Sunday.</P>
<P N="2">2. That is not a nece&s;&s;ity, which may be forborne to be done, without any ab&s;olute de&s;truction or lo&s;s of the thing, until the morrow. If a rick of hay be on fire, I may endeavor to quench it on the Lord's day:
<PB N="78" REF="022548_0094_0FB948B559B64298">
but if my corn be cut and lying upon the ground, on the Saturday, though the weather be rainy or inclining to wet, I may not make it into cocks, or fetch it home, upon the Lord's day; becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly Almigh|ty God may &s;end fair weather to-morrow: and there|fore, in my forbearance, I do two duties under one, viz. ob&s;erve his law, and re&s;t upon his providence. Men have nece&s;&s;ities many times, to &s;erve their ca&s;e, and &s;loth, and fancies, when in truth there is none; but the bu&s;ine&s;s may be deferred without any danger. If we would be more faithful in our obedience to God, we &s;hould find many pretended nece&s;&s;ities to vani&s;h into mere imaginations.</P>
<P N="3">3. Works of charity&mdash;relief of the poor&mdash;admin|i&s;tering phy&s;ic upon an apparent nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;vi&s;iting or comforting the afflicted&mdash;admoni&s;hing the di&s;orderly &mdash;per&s;uading peace between neighbors offended&mdash;and endeavoring to compo&s;e differences which require not much examination, or cannot be deferred without an apparent danger of greater mi&s;chief&mdash;the&s;e are not only permitted, but commendable, nay commanded, upon this day. But if the bu&s;ine&s;s require examina|tion, or may be deferred till to-morrow, then it is be&s;t to defer &s;uch examinations, and treaties between offended parties, till another day; becau&s;e they will take away too much of the little precious portion of time of this day, and may be as well done to-morrow.</P>
<P>As to the fourth,&mdash;what is proper, fit, or nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to the &s;anctification of this day&mdash; I will &s;et down particularly; for generals &s;eldom pro|duce any great effect, becau&s;e every man is apt to con&s;true them according to his own mind and liking.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would not have you meddle with any recrea|tion, pa&s;times, or ordinary work of your calling, from Saturday evening to Monday morning.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ri&s;e at lea&s;t three hours before morning &s;ermon; and when you have made your&s;elf ready, and wa&s;hed
<PB N="79" REF="022548_0095_0FB948B711674E98">
and fitted your&s;elf for the &s;olemnity of the day, read two chapters in the bible; and then go &s;olemnly to your private prayer, and de&s;ire of God his grace to enable you to &s;anctify his day: and after your private prayer, read another chapter; and let your reading be with attention, ob&s;ervation, and your head uncovered.</P>
<P N="3">3. When you are in the public wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, be uncovered all the while of reading, pray|ing, or preaching.</P>
<P N="4">4. Kneel upon your knees at prayer; &s;tand up at the reading of the p&s;alms, and at the fir&s;t and &s;econd le&s;&s;on, and the epi&s;tle and go&s;pel, &amp;c.&mdash;&s;o you &s;hall avoid offence.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sit at the &s;ermon, and be very attentive at your prayers, and in your hearing. I recommend your writing the &s;ermon, e&s;pecially until you are one or two and twenty years old; becau&s;e young minds are apt to wander; and writing the &s;ermon fixeth them, and maketh them more attentive.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the mini&s;ter readeth any p&s;alms or les|&s;ons, turn to them in your bible, and read along with him.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be very attentive and &s;erious at church: u&s;e no laughing, nor gazing about, nor whi&s;pering.</P>
<P N="8">8. Sing the p&s;alms with the re&s;t of the congregation.</P>
<P N="9">9. Eat moderately at dinner&mdash;rather &s;paringly than plentifully&mdash;upon this day; that you may be fit for the afternoon's exerci&s;e, without drow&s;ine&s;s or dulne&s;s.</P>
<P N="10">10. Walk half an hour after dinner in the garden, to dige&s;t your meat: then retire to your chamber, to 'commune with your own heart' until church-time.</P>
<P N="11">11. If you are well, be &s;ure to go to church morn|ing and afternoon; and be there before the mini&s;ter begin, and &s;tay until he hath ended: and all the while you are at church, carry your&s;elf gravely, &s;oberly, and reverently.</P>
<P N="12">12. After evening &s;ermon, go up to your chamber,
<PB N="80" REF="022548_0096_0FB948B9036191F0">
and read a chapter in your bible; then examine what you have written of the &s;ermon.</P>
<P N="13">13 In all your &s;peeches or actions of this day, let there be no lightne&s;s nor vanity: but let your actions and &s;peech be &s;uch as the day is, &s;erious and &s;acred, tending to learn or in&s;truct in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of your knowledge of God, and his will, and your own duty.</P>
<P N="14">14. After &s;upper, every one of you, going to bed, kneel down upon your knees, and de&s;ire of God his pardon for what you have done ami&s;s this day, and his ble&s;&s;ing upon what you have heard, and his acceptance of what you have endeavored in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="15">15. Perform all this cheerfully, and uprightly, and hone&s;tly; and account it not a burden to you: for as|&s;ure your&s;elves, you &s;hall find a ble&s;&s;ing from God in &s;o doing. And remember, it is your father, that tells you &s;o, and that loves you, and will not deceive you.</P>
<P>And thus I have written to you of the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day; wherein though I have omitted many things, that might have been fit to be in&s;erted, yet you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that I had but a &s;mall portion of time allowed me to write, while I lay at an inn, and upon that day wherein I have performed tho&s;e du|ties which I now enjoin you. Let the original be laid up &s;afely for your brother R &mdash;; and every one of you take copies of it, that you may thereby remem|ber the coun&s;els of,</P>
