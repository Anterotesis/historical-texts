<HEAD>Natural Religion aided by Revelation, and perfected in Chri&s;tianity.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t chapter of the book of GENESIS, 20th and 27th ver&s;es, it is written,
<Q>And God &s;aid, let us make man in our image, after our likene&s;s: and let them have dominion over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&mdash; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female created he them.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>_THE Jewi&s;h Hi&s;torian, furni&s;hed with mate|rials from on high, hath given us this conci&s;e account of the origin of man:&mdash; He tells us, That God created him, male and female, in his own image, and after his likene&s;s.</P>
<P>In conformity to the in&s;tructions thus received, and partly in con&s;equence of it, the wi&s;e and virtuous, in all ages and places, a&s;cribing their exi&s;tence to the &s;ame cau&s;e, have believed, that the Spirit of God hath made them, and the breath of the Almighty hath given them life.</P>

Many and various have been the opinions of Divines, both ancient and modern, in regard to what, and how much is intended by, and included in the Image of God, wherein man is &s;aid to be created. Every &s;imilitude of God, and every degree thereof, in the creature, man or angle, is doubtle&s;s &s;o far his Image; and &s;o it appears to be explained, in his Image, after his likene&s;s. Had the Image of God in man been no where mentioned in the book of Revelation, but in this part of &s;acred hi&s;tory, it is more than probable, there would not have been &s;uch a diver&s;ity of &s;entiment about it; but that it would have been confined (not indeed exclu&s;ively of the intel|lectual faculties of the human mind, and the original rectitude of them, for there is &s;imilitude in the&s;e; but) chiefly to that communicated right of &s;overeignty, which man received at his creation: That as God was &s;upreme Lord and Governor over all; &s;o he &s;hould be over the creatures of this lower world, and have domi|nion on earth. This re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e appears to offer the mo&s;t obviou&s;ly of any from the hi&s;tory it&s;elf:&mdash;But as men advance in the powers of rea&s;on, in their moral qualities, or in any kind of re&s;emblance towards the Deity, the idea of his Image in them, is nece&s;&s;arily varied, and enlarged:&mdash; Hence it has been differently &s;poken of in other parts of revelation; e&s;pecially by the New Te&s;tament writers, who have &s;ometimes repre&s;ented it as con&s;i&s;ting in holine&s;s, And from this various u&s;e and &s;ignification of the Image of God in man, many learned and good men have &s;uppo&s;ed, it ought to be under&s;tood from the fir&s;t as a complex idea, made up of &s;everal ingredients. So much I have thought not improper to &s;ay in regard to the Image of God, in which man was created; and, indeed, I could not well avoid it, as it makes part of the hi&s;tory, placed at the
<PB N="7" REF="016303_0005_0F9C1F664BC53EA0">head of this di&s;cour&s;e. Sen&s;ible, however, of my inabi|lity to offer any thing on the point, that has not already been much better done by others; and the de&s;ign of this Lecture demanding no &s;uch inve&s;tigation, I &s;hould, perhaps, have been acquitted if I had pa&s;&s;ed it in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Other di&s;qui&s;itions are now to be made, which, it is hoped, will have &s;ome tendency, "to prove, explain or &s;hew the proper u&s;e and improvement of the principles of Natural Religion," which is our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, and the more ju&s;t arrangement of our thoughts, the creature man, and the religion of his nature, &s;hall be the &s;ubject of our promi&s;cuous inquiry: This will prepare the way for &s;ome ob&s;ervations and reflections, which will clo&s;e the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The faculty of rea&s;on, with which man is endowed, enable him, by obvious deductions from the contem|plation of the beauty, order and maje&s;ty of the world, and the evident impre&s;&s;ions of power, wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s, which it every where bears, both to argue the being of a God, and to admit al&s;o, that there is one, when told, that it mu&s;t be &s;o; and of con&s;equence, to make con&s;iderable di&s;coveries in religion.</P>
<P>Religion, both natural and revealed, in the ju&s;t and proper notion of it, has an immediate re&s;pect to the Deity; and in this view, though not in any other, it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from ju&s;t &s;entiment, and right action, which have no regard to his authority. It is founded in the divine exi&s;tence and perfections; that is, if God did not exi&s;t, or if he were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e per|fections, which are nece&s;&s;arily e&s;&s;ential to a &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, there could be no religion. The perception of
<PB N="8" REF="016303_0006_0F9C1F678A439FE0">the obligation of religion on man ari&s;es from his believ|ing that God is, from the knowledge he has of his intel|lectual capacities, the circum&s;tances he is placed in, and the relations he bears to the Creator. The obligation of religion, and the perception of this obligation in the human mind are di&s;tinct and different ideas; and the former mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t prior, in the order of nature, to the latter.&mdash; What I intend is, that religion is naturally and in it&s;elf right: It is fit and proper con|duct in the creature to wor&s;hip and obey the Creator, and it cannot be otherwi&s;e, &s;o long as the relations be|tween them remain: But then the obligation to do &s;o is only felt, when, and &s;o far as this is perceived to be fit and proper. It is very po&s;&s;ible for man, &s;o far to abu&s;e his intellectual faculties, neglect enquiry and every rational deduction, as not to feel the force of this obligation, or at lea&s;t to have but dark, indetermi|nate and confu&s;ed notions about it. This is more or le&s;s the ca&s;e with all &s;uch as have fallen into any kinds of idolatrous wor&s;hip. The perception of the obli|gation of religion, in in&s;tances, where the proper object of wor&s;hip is mi&s;taken, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed equally clear and vigorous, as in tho&s;e, where it is not; for &s;uper&s;tition, about which there is often the greate&s;t zeal, is no other than the corruption of pure religion. Men fall into the former, in the &s;ame proportion as they lo&s;e the proper &s;en&s;e of the obligation of the latter. It would, I tru&s;t, be far from the truth to affirm, that the obligation to wor&s;hip the One only living and true God cea&s;es, in proportion as the per|ception of it in the mind does &s;o, or becomes le&s;s clear and manife&s;t: Yet &s;o it mu&s;t be, if the obligation of religion be not prior to, di&s;tinct from, and independent on the perception of it. From the denial of this po&s;ition,
<PB N="9" REF="016303_0007_0F9C1F685E6BB458">it will, I think, follow, that if any individual among men &s;hould ever unhappily &s;ink even below idolatry it&s;elf, and &s;o darken his notions of the author of nature, as to pay him no kind of religious homage at all (which is no impo&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition) the obligation thereto would become totally extinct. This obligation, therefore, to religion is to be con&s;idered as &s;omething permanent and fixed in the nature and relations of things; founded in the divine Being and attributes, re&s;ulting from the rectitude of his will, and &s;uited to the rational faculties of men: Suited I &s;ay, to their rational faculties; becau&s;e, though it be an immoveable unabating principle of religious &s;ervice to every one; yet is it not, I &s;uppo&s;e, exactly the &s;ame in all; that is, it does not demand preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;ervices towards God from all. It would, indeed, do &s;o, were the rational faculties of men, their opportunities, means of moral &s;cience and improvement, every where equal: But as they are manife&s;tly various, and even widely different, this obligation is to each, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his faculties and opportunities to know God, and his duty to him.</P>
<P>What were the intellectual capacities of the original progenitors of mankind is difficult to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash; What has been often &s;aid of one of them, in particular, his mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge of natural things animate and inanimate, their natures, qualities, u&s;es and ends; and his comprehen&s;ive and clear di&s;cernment of moral truths, is, I believe, meer hypothe&s;is, altogether un|&s;upported by any thing recorded in &s;acred hi&s;tory, of what he ever &s;aid or did. It appears extremly unphilo&s;ophical, as well as incon&s;i&s;tent with every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">|logical argument, to imagine, that, at the in&s;tant of his creation, he was inve&s;ted with as ample powers of rea&s;on and moral reflection, as he was made capable
<PB N="10" REF="016303_0008_0F9C1F68E2D7A998">of attaining to, and did, probably, afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;s, The faculties of this my&s;terious man for improvement in natural and moral &s;cience, were, doubtle&s;s, every way &s;ufficient for his nece&s;&s;ities; for his duly ob&s;erving the law he was under, and to quality him for that higher and more perfect happine&s;s for which his benevolent Creator de&s;igned him. This, however, determines nothing, as to the comparative &s;trength of his faculties; or whether they were greater, or le&s;s, than tho&s;e of the generality of his po&s;terity. The knowledge he had, the moment of his being brought into exi&s;tence (if, indeed, he had any, be&s;ides the per|ception that he did exi&s;t) mu&s;t have been communi|cated. But to affirm, that the communication was co|eval with his exi&s;tence, or that his knowledge was concreated with him, is to &s;ay much more than is nece&s;&s;ary. It is not only incapable of any proof, but is, moreover, un&s;upported by the argument of analogy. We are, indeed, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, very incom|petent judges of what Omnipotence can do. It far &s;urpa&s;&s;es the comprehen&s;ion of creatures, boldly to a&s;&s;ert, that God has not done, or cannot do, thus or &s;o; meerly, becau&s;e we have no conception of the modus of his operations. It is as daringly impious, as it is weak and inconclu&s;ive arguing, and it directly militates again&s;t the plaine&s;t fact in nature, the work of creation it&s;elf; for we do not know how things were made.&mdash; We are, notwith&s;tanding, to judge of things, when we have a right to judge at all, with the faculties which he has be&s;towed, in the be&s;t manner we are able, and according to that rule which the known methods of the divine conduct furni&s;h us with. This rule, the be&s;t we have, leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the knowledge of the fir&s;t man was communicated and acquired after he had received his exi&s;tence; and that it was not co|eval,
<PB N="11" REF="016303_0009_0F9C1F6C02E99EE8">or concreated with him. The &s;ame great and important ends would be equally obtained on the for|mer as on the latter &s;uppo&s;ition. No doctrine of re|ligion, that I know of, natural or revealed, would, in any degree, be affected, much le&s;s injured by it: It is indi&s;putably more con&s;onant to the &s;ub&s;equent ways of divine providence. We can have no conception of knowledge in man, or indeed in any other creature, but that, which is made up of ideas gradually ad|mitted, and properly ordered by the under&s;tanding. We have, however, &s;ome colour of rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the fir&s;t man's capacity to receive tho&s;e ideas, out of which he was to form his knowledge, was not as in after ages, by the &s;low degrees of infancy and youth; but in more &s;peedy and free &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, both by frequent divine &s;ugge&s;tions, and the continual pre|&s;entation of external objects: This being more adapted to the original manhood of his con&s;titution, and the full-made &s;trength of his bodily &s;en&s;es. It is mo&s;t probable, that he was greatly aided by the Creator, in ama&s;&s;ing and perfecting the furniture of his under|&s;tanding; that he was told who his maker was, as &s;oon as he could make proper u&s;e of &s;uch knowledge; and that the great variety of living creatures, and thing inanimate, which he &s;aw around him, had the &s;ame cau&s;e of exi&s;tence with him&s;elf, and were the care of the &s;ame providence. Hence, by deduction, he would &s;oon come to have &s;ome knowledge of the law of his nature, his dependence on and duty to the Creator; and on every reflection would arrive to more perfect notions hereof. Had he not been favoured with the aids of intimation by his Maker, but left to his own inve&s;tigations, and improvements on ideas admitted by the &s;en&s;es from outward objects only, however large we may &s;uppo&s;e his capacity to receive
<PB N="12" REF="016303_0010_0F9C1F6D523554C8">and make u&s;e of them; and however di&s;po&s;ed we may be to allow that he would, at length, by the de|duction, of rea&s;on, have learnt to con&s;ider him&s;elf as the effect of &s;ome cau&s;e; yet, I believe, it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether it would not have been much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">er before he could have had any notion of this cau&s;e being invi&s;ible. He would not, untaught, very readily have had any conception of there being invi|&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, or have extended his views beyond the vi&s;ible world, or have formed any ju&s;t and tolerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of a Being &s;o &s;piritual and incomprehen&s;ible, as God. &mdash; What conception could he po&s;&s;ibly have had at fir&s;t, unin&s;tructed, as we now &s;uppo&s;e him, of the divine unity, infinity and eternity, which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the proper notion of the Deity? The knowledge of the&s;e was not to be obtained, but in a cour&s;e of ju&s;t rea&s;oning and deduction; and as imper|fect as his notions were, &s;o proportionably imperfect mu&s;t his religion have been. There appears &s;ufficient foundation from the hi&s;tory of the early periods of man's life to &s;uppo&s;e, that he received very great and &s;ea&s;onable helps from the Creator. It is manife&s;t, that he was favoured with vi&s;its from his Lord; and &s;ome circum&s;tances make it probable, that they were frequent. It is, moreover, certain, that he was in|&s;tructed by him, in regard to his worldly conduct and temporal felicity. Judging from the notions we now have of the divine character, which from eternity is unchangeably the &s;ame, we cannot, we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, that le&s;s care was taken of him, with re&s;pect to moral &s;entiment and religious wor&s;hip. Although the di&s;pen&s;ation, man was at fir&s;t put under, was that of &s;trict and rigorous law, "obey and live;" "tran&s;|gre&s;s and die;" a di&s;pen&s;ation, which admitted of no promi&s;e of aid under any exigency, no provi&s;ion of pardon for any crime, for the&s;e would have changed
<PB N="13" REF="016303_0011_0F9C1F6DD28EB3B0">it's nature; yet, it is no way incon&s;i&s;tent with this di&s;|pen&s;ation, but, on the contrary, plainly deducible from the perfections of the Deity, that man &s;hould be fa|voured with every nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction with regard to the law it&s;elf; that he might have a full under&s;tanding of it, he able to keep it, and appri&s;ed of the con&s;equences of obeying or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing it. Such in&s;truction he re|ceived. As, by the &s;ame means he learned, much &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e he would have done, who had given him exi&s;tence, on whom he depended, and from what &s;ource the manifold favours and ble&s;&s;ings, with which he was &s;o liberally encompa&s;&s;ed, were derived; &s;o he was brought to know what the religion of his nature was. He &s;aw the fitne&s;s, he felt the obligation of loving and &s;erving his Maker; of expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments of piety, dependence and gratitude, in &s;uch ways only, and by &s;uch acts of external homage as the Deity &s;hould plea&s;e to appoint. He perceived it to be right, therefore his duty, to &s;ubmit to the divine authority in all things, to obey his will, to do his plea&s;ure, in whatever in&s;tance made known; in par|ticular, with regard to that of his avoiding the inter|dicted tree. Had he kept his &s;tation, as he might, had he opened and enlarged his rational faculties, ac|cording to his advantages, and improved by tho&s;e di|vine hints that were afforded him; his &s;en&s;e of right and of religious obligation would have been daily ren|dered more perfect and exten&s;ive. But he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed; and by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;trict law ended; that of grace, under the Mediator, commenced; and &s;in and death entered into the world. Whatever were the ability and advantages of man to keep his origi|nal &s;tate and pre&s;erve his primitive innocence, it is an inconte&s;tible fact, that his defection took place in con&s;equence of the fir&s;t temptation. Scared hi&s;tory
<PB N="14" REF="016303_0012_0F9C1F6EA39B4BA0">mentions no other; nor have we any rea&s;on to think he ever re&s;i&s;ted one. This, by the way, is no argument of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;upereminent intellectual powers, of moral di&s;cernment, above the common &s;tandard of mankind.&mdash;He tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and he mu&s;t die. This is the ju&s;t demerit and threatned penalty of &s;in. His Creator, however, did not for&s;ake him; but continued his providential care and watchfulne&s;s towards him. A plan of grace, on the fore&s;ight of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, had been previou&s;ly laid in the divine coun&s;els, whereby both the actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and his po&s;terity, who were now born to die, were, in future time, to be re&s;tored to life, through him who is the re&s;urrection and the life. From this period, God has thought fit to treat with the creature man, by the mediation of his Son, opening and di&s;covering divine truths to them, as they &s;hould be able to bear them, and were pre|pared to profit by them. Such di&s;coveries were made, at fir&s;t, as appear to be adapted to the infant &s;tate of the world. The knowledge which the fir&s;t man had of the Deity, and of moral obligation and truth, he, doubtle&s;s, communicated to his po&s;terity. For, though he mu&s;t have greatly felt the unhappy bia&s;s of a depraved heart, yet we know not that his intellectual powers, or meer knowledge of moral truth, were, at all, impaired by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The con|trary rather appears, as higher orders of beings, who have al&s;o &s;inned, are, notwith&s;tanding, repre&s;ented as being very &s;agacious and knowing, though indi&s;po&s;ed to all good. But I hope, whatever may be true of individuals, or even whole nations, &s;ince, that it will not de&s;erve cen&s;ure, if we do not carry the moral indi&s;po&s;ition of man, at this time, &s;o far as to equal it with that of Devils. The notions, which he now had of a future &s;tate and an immortal life after death,
<PB N="15" REF="016303_0013_0F9C1F6FAB41CAA0">mu&s;t, I think, have been collected out of that di&s;cour&s;e which God held with him after his defection.&mdash; The only po&s;&s;ible idea he could have of immortality in innocence, is that of continuance in life&mdash;Obey and live. It did not accord with the nature of the di&s;|pen&s;ation he was under, that he &s;hould have any other. What he now believed about a future &s;tate, he made known to his children, with the grounds of it. This called forth the exertion of their intellectual faculties, and they improved, grew wi&s;er, and had hope.&mdash;This hope God was plea&s;ed afterwards greatly to &s;trengthen, particularly by the tran&s;lation of Enoch, who&s;e piety was con&s;picuous. The rea&s;on of man was &s;ufficient, from hints, to deduce many important truths; and to &s;ee the fitne&s;s and obligation of &s;everal things, which, meerly of it&s;elf, would not have been &s;o &s;oon or ea&s;ily di&s;covered. Hence, I am inclined to think that na|tural religion is not &s;o properly defined to be that, which mankind have, or might come to the knowledge of, meerly by the &s;trength of una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on; as that, which rea&s;on &s;ees to be right, and feels the force of, when it is known, What rea&s;on knows to be fit, what it a&s;&s;ents to, approves and re&s;ts &s;atisfied in, when it is perceived, tho' it be offered to it, an&s;wers preci&s;ely the &s;ame purpo&s;es as to religion and moral obligation, and indeed, as to its being the foundation and te&s;t of revelation it&s;elf, that it would do, were it di&s;covered in its own &s;trength. To affirm, however, that the rea&s;on of man cannot come to the knowledge of God and his duty to him, by any contemplations and de|ductions of his own, is to &s;ay a great deal too much. Rea&s;on, properly employed, will make very great di&s;|coveries, and by attending to the con&s;titution and order of things, be led up to their cau&s;e. This not|with&s;tanding, had the immediate po&s;terity of Adam
<PB N="16" REF="016303_0014_0F9C1F7060216B08">received no light from him, or communications from the Deity, their progre&s;s in moral &s;cience would, undoubt|edly, have been very &s;low. It is evident, that God did not &s;ee fit to leave them, meerly, to their own in|ve&s;tigations. He &s;uperadded his daily a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the powers of rea&s;on, with which he had endowed them. He manife&s;ted him&s;elf to them, and directed his own wor&s;hip. There is no accounting for the early prac|tice of &s;acrificing on any other principle. Such care God has, certainly, taken of man from the beginning. He even conde&s;cended to rea&s;on with Cain, in regard to the mi&s;take he had made in his offering.</P>
<P>Although natural religion is founded in the ex|i&s;tence of God, and the relation man &s;tands in to him; and is, therefore, unalrerably the &s;ame, whether under|&s;tood by man or not; that is, it is an eternal truth, that the obligation of religion re&s;ults from &s;uch exi&s;tence and relations; yet this has not been di&s;covered meerly by the faculty of rea&s;on, exclu&s;ive of aid: but it has had helps; it has been &s;et to work; and when the di&s;covery has been made, religion has been found to be altogether agreeable to the under&s;tanding: it con|&s;ents to and feels the force of it, and it can no more reject or call it in que&s;tion, than it can tho&s;e truths, which nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from any other natural rela|tions, and the agreement or di&s;agreement of ideas. We cannot, however, argue, from natural religion's being founded in relations that cannot but exi&s;t be|tween the Deity and man, and the obligation of it being alike derived from this &s;ource on all, that the quantity thereof to each mu&s;t therefore be the &s;ame. The notion of a general natural religion for the hu|man race will, I tru&s;t, on examination be found to be groundle&s;s, and no way con&s;onant to the nature of
<PB N="17" REF="016303_0015_0F9C1F7361DBE478">things. Natural religion hath re&s;pect not to collective bodies of men, much le&s;s to the whole ma&s;s of man|kind, but to individuals; each one has his own natural religion, and it is more or le&s;s as is the rea&s;on of each, or at lea&s;t, as it might be, were it duly exerci&s;ed and improved. Indeed it makes no difference here, whe|ther we con&s;ider the rea&s;on of each man as it is, or as it would be, had it been exerci&s;ed and improved by every one to the utmo&s;t. In either ca&s;e it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in unequal portions. On the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, tho' each one would know more than he now does, or in other words, would have more rea&s;on than he now has, and con&s;equently, would have more natural religion; yet there would be as real a diver&s;ity among men as there is at pre&s;ent:&mdash; That is, they would not all have the &s;ame quantity of rea&s;on, and, therefore, could not all have the &s;ame quantity of natural religion; the latter being always proportionate to the former.</P>
<P>Every man is accepted according to that he hath, and not according to that he hath not. When the gifts of nature are &s;mall, and the opportunities and advantages for the acqui&s;ition of knowledge infe|rior, the le&s;s will be required. From him to whom one or two talents are committed the &s;ame improve|ments will not be exacted as from him who hath had five:&mdash;For it is equally true on the plan of nature, as that of revelation, that, to whom&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall much be required. A &s;ufficiency is given on either plan by the benevolent author of both, if duly cultivated and improved, to promote and &s;ecure the happine&s;s of every one. Le&s;s capacities are filled with le&s;s enjoyments. It is, notwith&s;tanding a good, much to be de&s;ired, to have our capacities enlarged, to know more of God and truth, natural and moral, that our
<PB N="18" REF="016303_0016_0F9C1F74C8FB1E38">happine&s;s may be al&s;o enlarged. The wi&s;e and good author of our nature hath, accordingly, &s;o framed them, that happine&s;s is made to depend on our&s;elves. It is unnece&s;&s;ary, to ob&s;erve, that I do not intend, it is &s;o, exclu&s;ively of tho&s;e aids, which, from the perfections of the Deity, are to be expected under the law of nature; and from his promi&s;e, under the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace. Happine&s;s, I &s;ay, depends on our&s;elves; ari&s;es out of our own indu&s;try and progre&s;s in tho&s;e moral improvements, which are commonly made to better advantage by the means of natural ones. The one does not, indeed, nece&s;&s;arily follow from the other, as effects from cau&s;es; but there is a tendency in the latter to beget the former; though, at the &s;ame time, from the principle of human liberty, the effect may not be, and often is not, produced. The greater, however, and the more exten&s;ive our knowledge is of natural, the greater may it be of moral truths. The more we know of the latter, the more may we love and embrace them, and conform to them, in temper and conduct towards God and the world around us. This is natural religion. From this happine&s;s re&s;ults. When we con&s;ider the intellectual powers of human nature, as original faculties to attain knowledge by aid and &s;ugge&s;tion; to improve every degree thereof; to extend and enlarge it; to argue, by this means, the being and perfection of the Deity from his works, and the obligation of the &s;everal duties we owe him, in due and proper order, from his attributes; it is not ea&s;y to &s;peak in too exalted &s;trains of them.&mdash;They are truly great and noble. They have in many in|&s;tances been carried far. To what lengths they might be pu&s;hed, even in this &s;tate, in regard of both natural and moral &s;cience, did not the decay and di&s;&s;olution of the body hinder enquiry, is impo&s;&s;ible to determine.
<PB N="19" REF="016303_0017_0F9C1F755100A170">Of this, however, we are certain, that the larger the &s;tock of &s;cience is in any mind, the better it is able to advance; the farther it goes, the farther may it go, and the clearer will be it's apprehen&s;ions of there being things, yet to be known; and the progre&s;s might be endle&s;s, as, in the other &s;tate, it will, doubtle&s;s, be &s;trictly &s;o. The mo&s;t rational and con&s;i&s;tent notion we can form of the condition of good men in heaven, is, that of continual advances in knowledge and holi|ne&s;s; approaching towards the Deity, and perfecting their image of him. Hence happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e, and increa&s;e in ju&s;t proportion. But if the rational faculties of man are &s;uppo&s;ed to be left to di&s;cover truths meerly in their own &s;trength, without aid or intimation, it will then be very difficult to &s;ay how great they will ever &s;hew them&s;elves, or what they may po&s;&s;ibly do. It is not manife&s;t, that the trial has ever yet been made; the contrary rather appears. And hence it may be ju&s;tly inferred, that the wi&s;e and benevolent author of our beings never de&s;igned, that the creature man, who was &s;o admirably formed, with capacities to receive by in&s;truction and improve upon every hint, &s;hould be left to the &s;low and uncertain acqui&s;ition of, and progre&s;s in knowledge, by the &s;ole exertion of his own faculties. The argument from what man can now do, with the helps he has had, in&s;tructed and enlightened as he is, to what he would, or could have done, without the&s;e advantages, is inconclu&s;ive and illu&s;ory. Let the con|jectures we have made, in regard to the fir&s;t man, turn out as they may, however great his knowledge, or in what way &s;oever he came by it, learned men, who have made the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical enquiries, generally agree, that his po&s;terity came into the world de&s;titute of knowledge, or even the materials of it, having only capacities to receive it.</P>

The opinion of innate ideas and principles, which prevailed for &s;o long a time, is now, almo&s;t, univer&s;ally given up; and that of the human mind receiving them afterwards di&s;tinct and &s;imple; comparing, compound|ing and di&s;po&s;ing of them, together with the percep|tion of tho&s;e operations, is adopted in its room, as the original of knowledge.

<P>The mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;ophers have not pretended to inve&s;tigate the mo&s;t important truths of the moral kind, whereof they had no knowledge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o much as aimed to e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e on fixed principles, and render them plainer by their rea&s;oning, which have been handed down to them by tradition.

And what &s;hall we &s;ay in regard to the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t fundamental truth in nature, that which is the ba&s;is of all other truth? In what age or country has he lived, and what is his name, or his &s;on's name, who, without any previous intimation, meerly by deduction and argument, has, in fact, proved the divine exi&s;tence? Though it is mo&s;t undeniably to be done from the things that are made; yet who has ever been put to the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it? If we look among the ancient or modern philo&s;ophers, who have
<PB N="21" REF="016303_0019_0F9C1F76CCC6DFC0">attempted the proof of the divine Being and perfec|tions, either by arguments <HI>a priori</HI> or <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> do we not find them before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary truth?

<P>To what has been advanced, I think the authority of St. Paul cannot be oppo&s;ed, who hath &s;aid, The invi&s;ible things of him &s;ince the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and god-head; &s;o that they are without excu&s;e. The Apo&s;tle is here &s;peaking of the heathens, but for what does he blame them? And on what account were they without excu&s;e? Was it be|cau&s;e they did not &s;eek after and find the true God, from his works, whom they had never before known? Does he not repre&s;ent them as knowing God already, but not glorifying him as God? As not liking to retain him in their knowledge? And as holding the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e that which may be known of God, is manife&s;t in them, for God hath &s;hewed it unto them? And does he not &s;peak of them, as being with|out excu&s;e; becau&s;e they had &s;o far lo&s;t the knowledge they once had of him, as to change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to cor|ruptible
<PB N="22" REF="016303_0020_0F9C1F7792AB1938">man, and to birds and four footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things; when, at the &s;ame time, they had &s;o clear and &s;triking an argument, before their eyes, of the invi&s;ible things of him; even his eternal power and godhead, as the things that are made did afford them? and had afforded all mankind, ever &s;ince they were made? This is evidently the &s;cope of the Apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning; and the argument is truly powerful and convincing; there is no re&s;i&s;ting its force, where pro|per attention is given, If the things that are made are &s;ufficient to prove the being, as cannot be denied, much more are they &s;o, to pre&s;erve the knowledge, of God, in every rational mind. And the intellectual faculties of men, duly employed, cannot but con&s;ent to this, and immediately perceive it to be &s;o. With|out excu&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t they be, to lo&s;e the know|ledge of him, after they have once had it, and change the truth of God into a lie, and wor&s;hip and &s;erve the creature more than the Creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed forever.</P>
<P>On what has been, thus far, di&s;cour&s;ed of man; the capacities he is endowed with; the means he enjoys of knowing God, and his duty to him; and the proportionate religion of his nature, &s;everal things may be noticed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we may ob&s;erve, with the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled piety and gratitude, that the divine care of man, in every period, has been &s;uited to the circum&s;tances he came under; commen&s;urate to the exigencies of his condition; and calculated to open and enlarge his views of moral &s;cience, and the mo&s;t fundamental principles of natural religion. In innocence, his Creator was his friend and patron, his daily protector and guide; and this, in a way &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with that
<PB N="23" REF="016303_0021_0F9C1F790D926168">liberty and active power with which he was endowed, as to leave room for merit and &s;elf-&s;atisfaction in the exerci&s;e of his own faculties. When he had &s;inned, he did not depart from him, and abandon him to the horrors of de&s;pair and ruin. Highly di&s;plea&s;ed and di&s;honored, as he certainly was, with his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and notwith&s;tanding the fulle&s;t te&s;timony he bore again&s;t it; &s;hewing his extreame&s;t abhorrence, by &s;uffering the con&s;equences thereof to come on, agree|able to the threatning; "in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die;" yet he took occa&s;ion, from this very act, to make farther di&s;coveries of his grace and kindne&s;s. He applied remedies again&s;t the prevalency of &s;in and lu&s;t, which had now entered into the world, and corrected and re&s;trained their growth, by new in&s;tructions and appointments, adapted to the degraded condition of humanity. He took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures, had they been regarded, to pre&s;erve and &s;pread the knowledge of him&s;elf and his wor&s;hip in the world; and finally, to procure the re&s;toration of men, from the darkne&s;s of death to a &s;tate of immortal life and glory. The paternal care which God &s;aw fit to take of man, from the beginning of his weakne&s;s and depravity, and the wi&s;e and gracious methods he has all along pur&s;ued, to convey the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;truction to him, and keep a &s;en&s;e of religion and moral obligation in his heart, cannot be recollected by us, in the pre&s;ent age of the world, who &s;o richly enjoy the benefits hereof, but with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude. By favoring man, with many appearances from the angel of his pre&s;ence, he declared him&s;elf and his ways to them, as far as the nece&s;&s;ity of their temporal concerns would admit, and their capacities were able to improve and receive ad|vantage by &s;uch in&s;tructions: He communicated the

"There were but two generations from Adam to Noah. So that we cannot well ima|gine that the knowledge and true wor&s;hip of God, during that time, Could be entirely lo&s;t, in any part of the world."</P>
<P>After the general deluge, con&s;idering what had &s;o recently happened, to manife&s;t the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t iniquity, and make his power known, and al&s;o that the world was, as it were, beginning anew; the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential truths of natural religion, as they were acknowledged, might be very well left, for &s;ome time, to traditionary conveyance, and the common rea&s;oning of mankind, without any new communications from the Deity. But no &s;ooner did men begin to fall away. and corrupt and darken their notions of the one &s;u|preme God, and incline to idolatry, than he &s;aw fit to interpo&s;e to prevent it, and to take various methods to invigorate the impre&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t leading and e&s;&s;ential truths, and enforce the obli|gation of religious homage. And when, notwith&s;tand|ing the paternal care, which God exerci&s;ed over his offspring, they had grown too generally refractory and di&s;obedient, obliterating their natural notions of him, and corrupting the fir&s;t principles of rea&s;on, even &s;o far as to darken their under&s;tandings, and render them&s;elves unfit &s;ubjects of the divine communications: in&s;omuch that he was, as it were, obliged to withhold favors of this &s;ort, as being no longer &s;uitable for
<PB N="25" REF="016303_0023_0F9C1F7A974F8F50">them. This, I &s;ay, being the ca&s;e, he did not fail to make u&s;e of other means, which had now become more adapted to the ob&s;curity of their under&s;tandings, and the depravity of their hearts, to do them good; to recover their lo&s;t notions of God, and the religion of their nature. He rai&s;ed up and furni&s;hed certain individuals of mankind, who had retained more ju&s;t and rational notions of the Deity and their duty to him, and of the general obligations of religious fear, wor&s;hip and obedience, than the re&s;t, to guide, teach and in&s;truct them, as both them&s;elves and the&s;e had before been taught of God. For this important pur|po&s;e, Abraham was called and very much di&s;tingui&s;hed, together with his po&s;terity, by notable di&s;coveries of God and religion, and many benefits and privileges, both of a temporal and &s;piritual kind. But, as a very eminently learned and judicious writer has ob&s;erved, &mdash;"we cannot think, that it was &s;o much on his own account, that he was thus di&s;tingui&s;hed; or that, for his &s;ake only, faith, or &s;incerity, is &s;aid to be imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s; but rather for the common benefit of mankind was all this done; in order to make him an in&s;trument, in the hand of providence (and a fit one he was) to convey the &s;ame faith and fear of God to all the nations round him." And be&s;ides Abraham, there were many other per&s;ons, &s;pread abroad in almo&s;t every nation, who were burning and &s;hining lights, in dark ages and places; and who, not|with&s;tanding the too great prevalency of idolatry, had pre&s;erved, &s;ome of them, con&s;iderably pure and rational, others, by far more con&s;i&s;tent notions of the one true God, than the generality. Even the &s;pirit of prophecy, which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by many, before Abraham's time, did not utterly cea&s;e among the &s;e|veral nations, in his day, nor &s;oon after it, There
<PB N="26" REF="016303_0024_0F9C1F7CD3C53BC8">were al&s;o other means of conveying divine admonitions to men, and &s;ome were in&s;tructed by vi&s;ions and revela|tions; whereby the knowledge of God and natural reli|gion was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, kept up in the world. But that, which had the mo&s;t direct and di&s;tingui&s;hed ten|dency to enlighten mankind; to reform their idolatrous practices and vices; and to recover and diffu&s;e, among all nations, proper conceptions of the power, ju&s;tice and maje&s;ty of the God of nature, and the religious obedience which he required and would accept of rea&s;onable beings, was his afterwards giving a written law to the Jews; &s;tatutes and judgments, more righ|teous than tho&s;e of other nations; and making him|&s;elf, as it were, the political head of their &s;tate; guiding and regulating their moral governmental and eccle&s;ia&s;tic affairs. In every part of which he &s;eems to have had in view the &s;ame divine intention, which he had pro&s;ecuted from the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That of applying to, calling forth and aiding the human rea&s;on; and adapt|ing his providential care to the circum&s;tances and nece&s;|&s;ities of mankind. God had before, in various in&s;tances, revealed his will to particular per&s;ons for the com|mon benefit; that is, he had made it known, at &s;uch times, and in &s;uch ways and degrees, as he &s;aw be&s;t &s;uited to accompli&s;h his benevolent purpo&s;e of informing mens minds, and giving &s;pring to the exertion of their rati|onal faculties; but he never had, 'till now, written his law for their con&s;tant peru&s;al. The learned Bi&s;hop, to whom I am already indebted, and &s;ome others, have &s;uppo&s;ed, with great probability, that Mo&s;es was divinely taught on this occa&s;ion, and that this was the origin of letters. Nor was the law confined to the Jewi&s;h nation; it had re&s;pect al&s;o to the &s;tranger: And all nations had, and were originally de&s;igned to have, a &s;hare of ble&s;&s;ings, in the adoption and ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="27" REF="016303_0025_0F9C1F7F9F7A5598">Abraham, and the giving of the law. Accordingly the Jews were made u&s;e of, in a great variety of ways, for the grand end of &s;preading the doctrine of the divine unity thro' the world, and re&s;toring and e&s;tabli&s;hing the e&s;&s;ential principles of natural religion. Whether they pur&s;ued their own inclination, in many in&s;tances, and aimed to be ble&s;&s;ings to other nations or not, is of no con&s;equence to enquire; &s;ince, in either ca&s;e, the divine plan is carried forward; and "the re&s;t of the world reap almo&s;t the &s;ame benefit by them, whether they keep their law and pro&s;per, or di&s;obey it and are in di&s;tre&s;s." By their rewards and by their puni&s;hments, by their victories, and by their captivities, the name of Jehovah is made known, and the great truths of religion &s;pread abroad and confirmed.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is a ju&s;t and obvious remark from the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, that the divine conduct towards men in the &s;everal ages of the world, and in all the darkne&s;s and diver&s;ity of their circum&s;tances, has been calculated to furni&s;h their minds with &s;uch degrees of light and knowledge, in regard to their moral &s;tate, and the nece&s;&s;ities of nature, as to di&s;po&s;e them for the ca&s;ier reception of the go&s;pel revelation, when it &s;hould be offered to them, and for the many di&s;tingui&s;h|ed privileges and advantages, which it brings along with it. Men &s;ee their wants by the means of light, and their having been accu&s;tomed to receive it, pre|pares them for more. They can in rea&s;on, have no prejudice again&s;t new di&s;coveries, when they have been u&s;ed to old ones; or to further and more perfect a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance when they have already had &s;ome, though more re&s;trained and par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ial; yet always &s;uch as was be&s;t adapt|ed to their moral circum&s;tances. The chri&s;tian di&s;pen|&s;ation may be properly con&s;idered, as the perfection
<PB N="28" REF="016303_0026_0F9C1F81167C2638">of the general plan of conduct in this world, pur&s;ued by the Deity with re&s;pect to the human race from the be|ginning. He early began in diver&s;e ways and manners to give them ju&s;t notions of the religion of their na|ture; and by his &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations, has been uniform|ly carrying forward the &s;ame de&s;ign; 'till it at length i&s;&s;ued in the &s;uperior light and advantage of the go&s;pel revelation. It is not e&s;&s;ential to the ju&s;t and proper notion of natural religion, that it &s;hould be di&s;covered, by the meer &s;trength of human rea&s;on; it is &s;ufficient if it be con&s;onant to rea&s;on, and founded in nature The way and manner of knowing it, does not come into the account; or make it more or le&s;s natural religion.</P>
<P>Let a part of the human race, in &s;ome dark corner of the earth, be &s;uppo&s;ed totally ignorant of all the natural religion that ever was in the world; let a few of them be now &s;o happy, as to di&s;cover it by contem|plation, and the proper u&s;e of their own faculties; and let them communicate it to the re&s;t. In this ca&s;e, I a&s;k would it not be equally natural religion in them all? And would it make any difference here, if the communi|cation &s;hould proceed from &s;ome other quarter, or even from the Deity? If it has its foundation in the divine perfections, and the relation there is between God and man; is not this enough to con&s;titute it the religion of nature, in whatever way men are &s;uppo&s;ed to come to the knowledge of it? To &s;peak, therefore, of what is called natural religion and revealed, as though they were totally di&s;tinct, and e&s;&s;entially and &s;ub&s;tantially different, is, I believe, to give an undue repre&s;entation of them both; and to admini&s;ter very unnece&s;&s;ary &s;upport to the cau&s;e of infidelity. The grand de&s;ign of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in every in&s;tance, has been, either di|rectly or con&s;equentially to open, enlarge and e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="29" REF="016303_0027_0F9C1F814DFA3B58">the genuine principles of natural religion; that is, the religion that is adapted to the nature and circum&s;tances of the creature, man. In this way, and with this de&s;ign, the benevolent Father of the univer&s;e has gone on, with re&s;pect to the human race, from the begin|ning down to the pre&s;ent time; ri&s;ing in the per&s;pi|cuity and fulne&s;s of his manife&s;tations; until he &s;aw fit, in the unfathomable depths of his wi&s;dom, to ble&s;s the world with the Go&s;pel revelation, and the di&s;pen|&s;ation of his grace, under the immediate conduct and admini&s;tration of the Son of his love; wherein the great principles and duties of natural religion are more perfectly taught, explained and under&s;tood; and more clearly and authoritatively enforced and confirmed, than they had ever before been under any former di&s;pen&s;ation. There is now, by the means of the Go&s;pel, more natural religion in the world than the rea&s;on of man, with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction that has been given it, had ever before brought him acquainted with; in&s;omuch, that it may be truly affirmed, that tho&s;e &s;ocieties, or even individuals, who have the mo&s;t Chri&s;tianity, have al&s;o the mo&s;t natural religion among them. It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, to the prai&s;e of the divine grace, that the Go&s;pel has made glorious di&s;coveries of things, which the rea&s;on of man could never come to the knowledge of, but by revelation. They are, however, &s;uch as have a tendency to pro|mote the principles, and oblige us to the practice of the &s;everal duties of natural religion. The general doctrine of the mediation of Chri&s;t, and it's appen|dages; that of atonement and ju&s;tification in his merits; and, indeed, the &s;everal offices, executed by him, in the great and glorious work of redemption, have for their object, the giving men ju&s;t views of the divine character; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;en&s;e of their own,
<PB N="30" REF="016303_0028_0F9C1F821FCBB5A0">and the &s;tate they are in; forming them to proper tempers towards God and one another, and leading them to a corre&s;pondent conduct: So that the &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity is calculated to &s;ubdue &s;in, which de|grades human nature; and to direct and influence men to act according to it's law, which dignifies and exalts it. But I pa&s;s on to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>Thirdly, That if the Deity has &s;een fit all along to aid the rea&s;on of man by frequent di&s;coveries, according to its nece&s;&s;ities, as we have heard, them no objection can be ju&s;tly formed again&s;t revelation in general; nor of con&s;equence again&s;t the chri&s;tian revelation in parti|cular, which is no other than his continuing to do the &s;ame. It has been &s;aid, with great rea&s;on and judg|ment, "That the &s;everal di&s;pen&s;ations of what we call revealed religion, have hitherto been, in the main, con|formable to tho&s;e of providence, in both the natural and moral world." And if &s;o, then revealed religion "may po&s;&s;ibly come from the &s;ame author, and receive yet farther increa&s;e, which the&s;e al&s;o do, as they are better under&s;tood."</P>
<P>It is indeed owing, in part to the greater improve|ments, which later ages have made in general &s;cience and literature, than former ages had done, that the modern Dei&s;ts know more, and more they do certainly know than their predece&s;&s;ors, the ancient philo&s;ophers. But this is chiefly to be attributed to the advantage of the chri&s;tian revelation, which has been a rich ble&s;&s;ing, even to tho&s;e who do not believe in it. One would be ready to imagine that we meet the Dei&s;ts on their own ground, and give them all their wi&s;hes, when we undertake to &s;hew that the chri&s;tian revelation is the fulfilment and perfection of the &s;ame plan, which the
<PB N="31" REF="016303_0029_0F9C1F82DC7504D8">Deity has pur&s;ued with men, from the fir&s;t; and that the great aim and tendency of it is to give them more ju&s;t and enlarged notions of the principles, and more &s;trongly to oblige them to the duties of natural re|ligion. Whether this be the ca&s;e or not, they them|&s;elves will allow, is worthy their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e, we have now had, may remind us all of the &s;ingular advantages we enjoy, in this age of light and inprovement, both to know and do our duty. But I cannot help felicitating my young brethren the Students of this univer&s;ity, in particular, on the peculiar ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of their &s;ituation, and the pro&s;pects they have before them. In this &s;eat of learning, kind Pro|vidence has honored them with privileges above the common portion of mankind; or even of tho&s;e who are figuratively &s;aid to be lifted up to heaven, with respect to theirs. And if they de&s;ire to an&s;wer the ju&s;t and rea&s;onable expectations of God, their friends or their country from them, it &s;hould be their care, that their literary and religious accompli&s;hments ri&s;e in &s;ome proportion to &s;uch happy enjoyments. When we are told of their general virtues, their regular behavior, their ea&s;y &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the good orders, in&s;truction and government of this &s;ociety; or of their honor|ing them&s;elves and this favored &s;eminary, by their lite|rary performances, we are glad: Rejoicing in their per&s;onal glory, and wi&s;hing them every ble&s;&s;ing, we an|ticipate the happine&s;s of future time, when they &s;hall be called forth to act their parts in places of tru&s;t and eminence both in church and &s;tate. But we are made &s;orry with every report of a different kind, and con&s;ole our&s;elves only with the hope, that it cannot be true. We, who have trod the paths of &s;cience before them,
<PB N="32" REF="016303_0030_0F9C1F8392DBA6E8">may po&s;&s;ibly, as we do mo&s;t willingly, afford them our friendly aid, but they mu&s;t not think to bound their progre&s;s in literature by the limits that have been &s;et to ours. They mu&s;t go beyond us. They enjoy happy opportunities for this. Their advantages, by means of daily improvements, are better than ours were. And if they do not &s;urpa&s;s us, they will have a greater account to give up before God at la&s;t. In addition to human literature, and the a&s;&s;iduous culti|vation of the liberal arts and &s;ciences, which will lead them to an ea&s;ier and more exten&s;ive acquaintance with the foundations both of natural and revealed religion, their minds mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with divine &s;cience. They mu&s;t acquire and cheri&s;h the mo&s;t reverential thoughts of the holy Scriptures, which are able to make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. Their hearts mu&s;t be repleni&s;hed with the divine grace. They mu&s;t know God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, whom to know is eternal life. Wi&s;dom is the principal thing: Therefore, get wi&s;dom; but with all thy getting, got under&s;tanding.</P>
