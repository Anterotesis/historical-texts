<P>IT is with the greate&s;t propriety I addre&s;s this paper to you: It is in your defence, at this great, this important cri&s;is I take the pen in hand: A cri&s;is big with the fate of the mo&s;t glo|rious empire known in the records of time; and by your firmne&s;s and re&s;olution, you may pre&s;erve to your&s;elves, your immediate offspring, and late&s;t po&s;terity, all the glorious ble&s;&s;ings of freedom given by Heaven to unde&s;erving mortals; by your &s;upinene&s;s and pu&s;illanimity, you will entail on your&s;elves, your children, and millions yet unborn, mi&s;ery and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>It is in your defence I now &s;tand forth to oppo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;anguinary and de&s;potic court that ever di&s;graced a free country.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="013898_0002_0F9257EBA84FBF78">
It is in your defence I now un&s;heath the &s;word of ju&s;tice, to oppo&s;e the mo&s;t profligate and abandoned admini&s;tration that ever &s;hewed the weakne&s;s, or abu&s;ed the confidence of a prince.</P>
<P>It is in your defence I now &s;tand forth, and with a firmne&s;s becoming an Engli&s;hman determined to be free, to oppo&s;e every arbitrary and every uncon|&s;titutional act of a venal and corrupt majority &s;muggled into the pre&s;ent new fangled court par|liament, through the villany of Lord North, and purcha&s;ed with the public money, to betray their tru&s;t, en&s;lave the people, &s;ubvert the Prote&s;tant religion, and de&s;troy the glory, honor, intere&s;t, and commerce, both foreign and dome&s;tic, of England and America; and all this villanous &s;acrifice of a great empire, a brave people, and the glorious truths of Heaven, to comply with the ambitious views, and gratify the mean vindictive &s;pirit of one, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a numerous train of deputy tyrants, who&s;e &s;ole aim has been to trample under foot the &s;acred rights of mankind, and the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution</P>
<P>It is in your defence, and in defence of the liberties of my country, that I now &s;tand forth, with a fixed re&s;olution, to oppo&s;e, and &s;hew to the world, unawed by fear, the dangerous ten|dency of every act of lawle&s;s power, whether it &s;hall proceed from the King, the Lords, or the Commons.</P>
<P>I will endeavour, in conjunction with my fellow laborer in this great work, to re&s;cue the liberty of the pre&s;s (that bulwark of freedom) from the ruin with which it is now threatened by &s;pecial ju|ries of Middle&s;ex, and the arbitrary deci&s;ions of a Scotch Chief Ju&s;tice, the glorious advocate for
<PB N="3" REF="013898_0003_0F9257ED533C58D0">de&s;potic &s;way. The heavy fines, and cruel im|pri&s;onment of the two Woodfalls, without even the appearance of guilt, and contrary to the intention of the jury, will be faithfully recorded by the pen of truth, and fill many pages in the black catalogue of Murray's
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Mansfield's name is Murray.</NOTE> crimes.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be my endeavour, in this degenerate age, to revive the dying embers of freedom, and rou&s;e my countrymen in England from that lethargic &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s and inattention, in which they &s;eem to &s;leep, at this time of national danger, when a mighty kingdom, and all the deare&s;t rights of men are ha&s;tening to their ruin; that they may yet &s;tand high on the roll of fame, equal with their brave and virtuous brethren in America, who are now &s;truggling in the glorious cau&s;e of liberty, again&s;t the cruel oppre&s;&s;ions and de&s;tructive de&s;igns of exalted villains, who&s;e actions will be tran&s;|mitted to po&s;terity in characters of blood, and their names for ever branded with eternal marks of in|famy; while America will remain the glory and ad|miration of the world, and be held in the highe&s;t veneration to the end of time. Let not the long envied glory of Britain, O my countrymen, be eclip&s;ed by the virtuous actions of the Americans in the new world! Our danger is the &s;ame, their cau&s;e is our cau&s;e; with the con&s;titutional rights of America mu&s;t fall the liberties of England; let us then, &s;hew our&s;elves equal to them in virtue, cou|rage, firmne&s;s, and re&s;olution; and, as they have done, prove to the world, we are alike enemies to tyranny, and lawle&s;s power, and that we never will be &s;laves to one, nor to a majority of five hundred and eighty-eight tyrants.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="013898_0004_0F9257EDC0EFBF00">
We will &s;train every nerve, and brave every danger, to &s;timulate our countrymen on this &s;ide the Atlantic, to a noble exertion of their rights as freemen; to &s;hew them the danger, as well as the infamy of remaining quiet &s;pectators of their own de&s;truction; and to remove that dark cloud of &s;la|very, which now ob&s;cures the glorious light of freedom; and, but for the virtue of our fore|fathers, would ages ago have overwhelmed this kingdom, like the &s;tates around us, in a long, a la&s;ting night of mi&s;ery and ruin.</P>
<P>Upon this plan, and with the&s;e principles, we &s;et out, and intend to proceed, that the pre&s;ent (if not too far degenerated) and future genera|tions may enjoy undimini&s;hed all the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty. To accompli&s;h this end, we will ri&s;k every thing that is dear to man, and brave both royal and mini&s;terial vengeance, to pre&s;erve from ruin (if po&s;&s;ible) the natural rights of mankind, the &s;acred con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, and the freedom of our country.</P>
<P>Agreeable to our motto we &s;hall ever think, "Liberty with danger preferable to &s;ervitude with &s;ecurity."</P>
<P>We &s;hould glory in the &s;miles of our Sovereign, but will never purcha&s;e them at the expence of our liberty; nor will we ever give up, but with our lives, the right to expo&s;e and publicly di&s;|play, in all its hideous forms, the cruel de&s;poti&s;m of tyrants. We can conceive no rea&s;on why the laws and religion of England &s;hould be &s;port|ed with, and trampled under foot, by a Prince of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick any more than by one of the Hou&s;e of Stuart; &s;urely upon every prin|ciple of ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e, what|ever
<PB N="5" REF="013898_0005_0F9257EE8BD07D88">is tyranny and murder in one man, is equally &s;o in another; and if it is ju&s;t to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t one, it is as ju&s;t to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the other. It is not a name, nor an office, however import|ant, that can or ought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> bring re&s;pect and reve|rence to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, while he acts below, and is unworthy of them. Folly and villany ought to have no a&s;ylum; nor can titles &s;anctify crimes, though in our days they protect criminals. A royal, right honourable, or a right reverend robber, is the mo&s;t dangerous robber, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t to be dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>Our modern advocates for vallany and &s;lavery have found out a new way of arguing and con|vincing the judgments of men; they make nice di&s;tinctions without a difference, and tell the world what was tyranny in the time of Charles the Fir&s;t is not tyranny in the days of George the Third, and to this they add a long catalogue of virtues which he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; they &s;ay he is pious, that his chief aim is to render his &s;ubjects a happy, great, and free people (and indeed he has more than once &s;aid &s;o him&s;elf) the&s;e and many other fal&s;ehoods, equally wicked and ab&s;urd, they endeavour to in|&s;til into the minds of the too ea&s;ily deluded Eng|li&s;h. The&s;e, and &s;uch like artifices, have ever been made u&s;e of in the reigns of arbitrary Kings, to deceive the people, and make them with more ea&s;e, and to chains well poli&s;hed, &s;ubmit their necks, and even reverence and adore the hand that rivets them. Thus do tyrants &s;ucceed, and the galling yoke of &s;lavery, &s;o much complained of by almo&s;t every nation in the world, becomes a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude in the people, through their own credulity and vile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Truth, in
<PB N="6" REF="013898_0006_0F9257EF46268A08">&s;pite of all the fal&s;e colouring of venal writers, &s;peaks a different language, and declares in oppo|&s;ition to the pen of fal&s;ehood, that blood&s;hed and &s;laughter, violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, popery and law|le&s;s power, characteri&s;e the pre&s;ent reign; and we will defy even the pen&s;ioned John&s;on, after the clo&s;e&s;t examination of the two reigns, to tell which is the be&s;t. Charles broke his coronation oath, butchered his &s;ubjects, made ten thou&s;and &s;olemn promi&s;es he never intended to perform, and often committed perjury (but the&s;e are no crimes in a King, for mo&s;t Kings pretend a divine right to be Devils) he tried to overturn the con&s;titution by force, but found his mi&s;take when it was too late, and that even royal villany does not always &s;uc|ceed; and when the ju&s;t vengeance of Heaven overtook him, he &s;aw (though he would not be|lieve it before, and imagined he had a divine right to &s;hed human blood) that the &s;ame power which rai&s;ed him up, could pull him down. The pre&s;ent Sovereign, not wi&s;hing to make a figure in hi&s;tory without a head, and being more mild and gentle, ju&s;t and good, has improved upon the plan, and is now tearing up the con&s;titution by the roots, under the form of law; this method of pro|ceeding is certainly much &s;afer, and more judicious, as well as ju&s;t; for what right can an Engli&s;hman have to complain, when he is legally made a &s;lave by act of parliament. How wicked! how rebel|lious! mu&s;t the Americans be, and what levelling principles mu&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;s, to re&s;i&s;t the divine right of the King, and the divine power of the Lords and Commons, under the &s;anction of a di|vine act of parliament, &s;ent from heaven to plun|der, butcher, &s;tarve or en&s;lave them; ju&s;t as it
<PB N="7" REF="013898_0007_0F9257F006ED50C0">&s;hall come into their divine heads, or the heads of their divine in&s;truments; and when once they have carried this divine law into execution, according to their righteous intention, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee on this &s;ide the Atlantic, that they have the &s;ame divine right to u&s;e us in the &s;ame merciful and divine manner. This is but the fir&s;t divine &s;tep of a diabolical plan for &s;hedding human blood, reducing an indu&s;trious, brave, flouri&s;hing, and free people, from a &s;tate of affluence to that of mi&s;ery, beg|gary, and &s;lavery; and nothing but a re&s;olution in the people here will be able to prevent the next divine &s;tep on the &s;ame plan, from laying in ruins all the rights of the Briti&s;h, with tho&s;e of the American world.</P>
<P>The altar of de&s;poti&s;m is erected in America, and we &s;hall be the next victims to lawle&s;s power; all the horrors of &s;lavery now &s;tare us in the face; our religion &s;ubverted, freedom, law, and right, artfully undermined; the Roman catholic religion not tolerated, but e&s;tabli&s;hed; a majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Hou&s;e of Lords, mere creatures of the King; in &s;hort, every engine of oppre&s;&s;ion and arbitrary power is at work to accompli&s;h our ruin.</P>
<P>O, my countrymen! that we could but in&s;pire you with noble &s;entiments of LIBERTY, rou&s;e you to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your immediate danger, and make you feel, &s;en&s;ibly feel, all the ble&s;&s;ings de|rived from freedom, the natural right of every man, but more peculiarly of Engli&s;hmen; it is our birthright, our inheritance; it was handed down to us by our ance&s;tors, and &s;ealed often with their blood; let us then, in ju&s;tice to them, to our&s;elves, and to po&s;terity, make a noble con&s;titutional &s;tand,
<PB N="8" REF="013898_0008_0F9257F0BB47CBE8">in conjunction with our noble and &s;pirited, but &s;uffering fellow &s;ubjects in America, again&s;t the pre&s;ent plan long fixed by the minions of power to de&s;troy it, and overturn the con&s;titution, a con|&s;titution ten thou&s;and times &s;uperior to any &s;y&s;tem ever devi&s;ed by the Greeks or Romans.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a time as this, when the mercile&s;s, the relentle&s;s hand of tyranny is tearing out the vitals of freedom, &s;apping the foundation of public &s;e|curity, making a mockery of ju&s;tice, and de&s;troy|ing all the envied rights of Britain and the truths of Heaven; I &s;ay, at &s;uch a time, to be inatten|tive, or inactive, is infamy; and he who can tamely &s;ee his country upon the brink of ruin, without putting out his arm, and lending a helping hand to re&s;cue her from de&s;truction, mu&s;t be an aban|doned wretch, a di&s;grace to the name of Engli&s;h|man and to his country.</P>
