<HEAD>A brief Account of the State of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not very long after the beginning of the former <HI>Century,</HI> That a con&s;iderable Num|ber of the Subject of the Crown of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by the Allowance, and under the Countenance and Protection of the Supream Authority, did Tran&s;plant them&s;elves, Families and E&s;tates into the remote Regions of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>THESE fir&s;t Planters were known to be Per|&s;ons not only of approved Piety to GOD, but of ex|emplary Loyalty to the Throne and Government they belonged to, and brought the&s;e Principles of affection and duty to their Prince into the&s;e His di&s;tant Dominions, and their care was to tran&s;mit the &s;ame Loyal Principles and Spirit to their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>TO encourage and &s;trengthen them to &s;ub|mit to the many Toils, Hazards and va&s;t Ex|pence in Subduing and Planting a Wilderne&s;s. They were favoured with the Royal Grant of a CHARTER, by which they were ve&s;ted with &s;everal Powers, Liberties, and Priviledges for their good Order and Government.</P>
<P>UNDER the Protection of the Royal CHAR|TER,
<PB N="3" REF="001896_0003_0FB9D5CB91EE7058">
in which they intirely confided for the &s;ecurity of the Liberties therein granted, they were animated chearfully to undergo, unknown Perils and Hard&s;hips, which were unavoidable in their fir&s;t Plantations: By which a valuable acce&s;&s;ion has been made to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Domi|nions, and the Commerce of <HI>Great Britain</HI> en|larged, without any Charge to the Crown.</P>
<P>IN the latter end of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, this <HI>Charter</HI> was vacated by a Judgment in the High Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> which Judgment was re&s;pited till the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, when this Corporation were disfranchi&s;ed, and actually dive&s;ted of all the Powers, Liberties &amp; Priviledges that had been granted to them.</P>
<P>AFTER the happy Revolution tho&s;e Glori|ous Princes King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> &amp; Queen <HI>MARY</HI> of Immortal Memory, were plea&s;ed in their Princely Wi&s;dom and Grace, by their Royal CHARTER to Unite, and Erect into One Pro|vince the Colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, New-Plymouth, &amp;c.</HI> by the Name of the Pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> which was to be Governed by a Governour, Council and A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>BY this Royal CHARTER many valuable Priviledges and Immunities are ve&s;ted in the Body of the People inhabiting &s;aid Province, their Properties &s;ecured, and all the Immuni|ties and Liberties of natural Subjects born in
<PB N="4" REF="001896_0004_0FB9D5CDB17BBD68">
the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> are granted and affirm|ed to them.</P>
<P>HEREBY al&s;o Powers are ve&s;ted in the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of Electing Annually &s;uch as &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t in Council, to Con&s;titute and Settle all Civil Officers, under certain Re&s;trictions and Re&s;ervations: To Erect Courts of Judi|cature, To Levy Taxes upon &s;aid Inhabitants for the Support of the Government, and De|fence of the Province. And to make Laws from time to time not repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> for the good Government of the Subjects.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the Govern|ment of the &s;aid Province by its pre&s;ent CHAR|TER, effectual Provi&s;ion is made to maintain their intire dependence on, and to &s;ecure in all points the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown.</P>
<P>THE Nomination and Con&s;titution of the Governour, Lieutenant Governour, Secretary, and all Officers of the Admiralty, is wholly re&s;erved to the Crown.</P>
<P>THE Power of the <HI>Militia</HI> is wholly in the hands of His Maje&s;ty's Governour, as Captain General.</P>
<P>ALL Judges and Ju&s;tices, of a Superiour and Inferiour Order, and Sheriffs, to whom the Exe|cution of the Laws are Entru&s;ted, are nominated and appointed by the Governour, with the Ad|vice and Con&s;ent of his Maje&s;ty's Council.</P>
<P>THE Governour has a Negative upon all Laws, Elections, and Acts of Government of the General A&s;&s;embly and Council.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001896_0005_0FB9D5CF38115138">ALL Laws Enacted by the General A&s;&s;embly and approved of by the Governour are to be tran&s;mitted Home for the Royal Approbation and if di&s;allowed within the &s;pace of Three Years, to be utterly void.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's Liege People of this Province have &s;ince the Enjoyment of their pre&s;ent CHAR|TER been expo&s;ed to many inconceivable Hard|&s;hips by two long and bloody Wars with the bar|barous Salvages, in which with great Unanimity and Alacrity, they have defended the&s;e His Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions with great Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE Inhabitants of this Province have al|ways had a ju&s;t value for their Civil Liberties. But the free and &s;ecure Enjoyment of their Reli|gious Priviledges, has ever been mo&s;t dear to them: and e&s;teem'd a plentiful Reward of all the Dangers and Difficulties they have been &s;trugling with, from their fir&s;t Plantation to this Day.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Planters of the&s;e His Maje&s;ty's Ter|ritories, were as to their Per&s;wa&s;ion in Religion, &s;uch as in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation were called Puritans, who de&s;ired and &s;ought, what was in their ap|prehen&s;ion a further Reformation, in point of Di&s;cipline, and Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THAT they and their Po&s;terity after them might Enjoy the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences in the&s;e Points, and Wor&s;hip GOD according to their be&s;t Light, with le&s;s hazard to them&s;elves and le&s;s offence to others, They &s;ought a place of re&s;t in the&s;e remote Regions.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001896_0006_0FB9D5D19D395A90">NOTWITHSTANDING their con&s;cientious di&s;&s;ent from the Church of <HI>England</HI> in &s;ome le&s;&s;er Points, yet in their Removal they paid all ju&s;t Regards to Her, they dutifully askt her Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ing in their Settlement, &amp; heartily prayed for the Pro&s;perity of Religion in her Communion.</P>
<P>BY the Care and Zeal of the&s;e fir&s;t Planters, the Kingdom of CHRIST was fir&s;t Planted in the&s;e His Maje&s;ty's di&s;tant Dominions, Churches Erected in their &s;everal Towns &amp; Plantations, in which the Go&s;pel is Di&s;pen&s;ed, &amp; the Ordinances of GOD's Hou&s;e, Admini&s;tred, without any Terms of Communion, but what according to their be&s;t <HI>Light,</HI> were plainly pre&s;cribed in the <HI>Word of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrines of Faith profe&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Churches are entitely <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> mo&s;t agreeable to the Doctrinal Articles and Homilies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Confe&s;&s;ions of the Reformed Churches abroad.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Churches</HI> in point of Di&s;cipline &amp; Mode of Wor&s;hip are mainly <HI>Congregational</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyteri|an,</HI> of one Profe&s;&s;ion &amp; Principle, with the United Brethren the <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>South-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE U&s;e and Power of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils &amp; Synods is here acknowledged, &amp; the Right not only of the Churches, but al&s;o the Power of the Civil Government to Convocate &s;uch A&s;&s;em|blies, when the nece&s;&s;ities of the Churches &s;hall call for them, is A&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>IT is required that the Pa&s;tors of the&s;e Chur|ches, be Per&s;ons of approved Sanctity of Life,
<PB N="7" REF="001896_0007_0FB9D5D3B5AC6AE0" MS="y">
Orthodoxy in the Faith, of good Learning and known Mini&s;terial Abilities: The&s;e are Elected by the People, They take the Charge of; &amp; are &s;et apart to the Pa&s;toral Office, by the Impo&s;i|tion of the hands of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI></P>
<P>TO provide for a Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an Or|thodox &amp; Learned Mini&s;try in the&s;e Churches, <HI>Grammar-Schools</HI> were Erected in the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Towns through the Province, and a <HI>Col|lege</HI> early was Founded, where the Liberal Arts and Sciences are publickly taught, and nothing required to qualify for Academical Honours, and Priviledges, but a proficiency in Learning and good Morals.</P>
<P>BY the Favour of Heaven upon this Seminary of Piety, &amp; good Literature, the&s;e Churches, have hence been fully &s;upplied from time to time to this Day, with a well qualified Mini&s;try, who have taught them the good Knowledge of GOD.</P>
<P>THESE Churches, tho' not formed in all points, in exact Conformity to the E&s;tabli&s;ht Church of <HI>South-Britain,</HI> yet have their Con&s;titution and Priviledges &s;ecured to them, not barely, by an Act of Toleration, but a Legal Approbation and E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>MANY good Laws have been Enacted by the Go|vernour and A&s;&s;embly, by which the&s;e Churches are Protected &amp; Encouraged in the peaceable and regular Profe&s;&s;ion &amp; Practice of their Religious Priviledges, their Form of Wor&s;hip, Church Order &amp; Di&s;cipline. By which al&s;o the Method of Calling &amp; Setling Mi|ni&s;ters in the &s;everal Congregations through the Pro|vince, is Legally &s;tated and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and Legal Provi&s;ion made for the Honourable Support and
<PB N="8" REF="001896_0008_0FB9D5D5EEA87D10" MS="y">
Maintenance of the Mini&s;ters thus Called &amp; Setled.</P>
<P>ALL which Laws have been Confirmed, by the Approbation and Sanction of the Crown in the Glo|rious Reign of King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory.</P>
<P>THROUGH the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven the&s;e Chur|ches under their pre&s;ent Securities, have greatly flou|ri&s;hed and increa&s;ed, That at the pre&s;ent Time, there are above an <HI>Hundred</HI> Religious A&s;&s;emblies and Con|gregations in this Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> be&s;ides about <HI>Thirty</HI> A&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;tianized <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> who profe&s;s the Faith, Order and Wor&s;hip here|in acknowledged.</P>
<P>AND at the &s;ame time there are through the whole Province not above <HI>Three</HI> Congregations that in their Form of Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline, profe&s;s them|&s;elves of the Per&s;wa&s;ion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> Though Per&s;ons of that per&s;wa&s;ion are under no Re&s;traints, or Di&s;couragements, but are ever Treated with all Chri&s;tian Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t in Ju&s;tice be affirmed to the Honour of the&s;e Churches of the <HI>Congregational</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Denomination, that there is not one Mini&s;ter or one &s;ingle Per&s;on known in their Communion, but what are full of Duty, Zeal and Affection to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Illu&s;trious Prote&s;tant Hou&s;e of <HI>HANOVER,</HI> and do account them&s;elves under the &s;tronge&s;t ties, to Ble&s;s GOD for the happy Acce&s;&s;ion of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> to the Throne of his Ance&s;tors, and both Pa&s;tors and People do utterly abhor the late Impious and Rebellious attempts, to di&s;turb His Peaceable Go|vernment. They Adore and Prai&s;e the Hand of Heaven in giving &s;uch a &s;ignal Bla&s;t to the de&s;igns of tho&s;e wicked Sons of Violence. And their Prayers are ever going up, for the long Life and Pro&s;perity of His Maje&s;ty, and the whole Royal Family.</P>
