<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING frequently ob&s;erved that &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> attended my preaching, I was led to reflect on the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate</HI> of that dear neglected people. The more attentively I con&s;idered the matter, the more &s;en&s;ibly was my compa&s;&s;ion excited, and the more powerfully were my affections drawn out towards them. At length my heart di&s;&s;olved in pity; and I determined to preach to them on a &s;ubject, in which, I conceive, they are deeply intere&s;ted. This I did: and multitudes of them, knowing my intention, hon|oured me with a candid hearing. The di&s;cour&s;e it&s;elf I now publi&s;h; in compliance with the earne&s;t &s;olicita|tion of &s;everal who heard it; in vindication of my&s;elf from the errors and ab&s;urdities &s;ome <HI>mercenary printers and book&s;ellers</HI> would father upon me in their <HI>&s;urrepti|tious editions;</HI> and in hopes that the profits, ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of it among the Gentiles, will enable me to di&s;tribute the copies <HI>gratis</HI> to the Jews.</P>

<P>&rindx; On peru&s;ing the following Di&s;cour&s;e, the reader will be naturally led to inquire, "Is it known whether this Sermon had any particular effect upon the Jews?" To &s;atis|fy this inquiry, the following extracts are &s;ubjoined.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>PIERCE,</HI> of Birmingham, in a letter of the 20th of November la&s;t, to a Mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, thus writes&mdash;."It will give you plea&s;ure to be informed that many Jews in London have lately attended on the Go&s;pel&mdash;that a Society for their in&s;truction is formed&mdash;that the &s;econd Sermon preached to them under its patron|age was delivered la&s;t night&mdash;and that they expre&s;s gratitude for the re&s;pect &s;hewn them by the&s;e appropriate &s;orvices."</P>
<P>In another letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>MANTLE,</HI> of We&s;tbury, in England, to a Clergyman in Newbury-Port, dated February ult. is the following&mdash;"The clouds of darkne&s;s which have long hung over God's ancient people the Jews begin to di&s;&s;ipate, and the glorious purpo&s;es of Heaven beam forth in their progre&s;s to perfect day. The Batavian A&s;&s;embly has di&s;&s;olved the unnatural alliance of Church and State, and re&s;tored to the privileges of citizens, the Jews who are di&s;tributed throughout their provinces in va&s;t mul|titudes. In London, thou&s;ands of the Jews attend under the min|i&s;try of Mr. <HI>COOPER,</HI> in Sion-Chapel. Va&s;t numbers of his fir&s;t Sermon [the one here followin have been publi&s;hed and di&s;trib|uted gratis among them, and con&s;iderable efforts are making to dif|fu&s;e the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity among that long neglected people."</P>

<HEAD>The PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>O THOU God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of Jacob! behold the company of poor &s;inners, Jews and Gentiles this day in thy great pre&s;ence. O Lord God! bow down, and ble&s;s with thy &s;miles, this numerous congregation; be in the mid&s;t of this people as thou wa&s;t in the mid&s;t of the camp of I&s;rael of old, and let that glory which went before them, be &s;hown unto us. O Lord God Almighty! behold the children of I&s;rael; and &s;tretch forth, for their deliverance, thy hand, which is not &s;hortened that it cannot &s;ave; and let thine ear, which is not heavy, be inclined to our petitions. We de&s;ire to prai&s;e thy name for all the wonders that are recorded in thy ble&s;&s;ed word. Thou did&s;t take thy &s;ervant Abraham of old out of the land where he was; thou did&s;t call him into a land where he had never been; and thou did&s;t, contrary to nature, give him a &s;on, from whom thou did&s;t promi&s;e a &s;eed &s;hould come, in which all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed. Thou did&s;t, by wonderful mercies&mdash;thou did&s;t by wonderful providences pro|tect them and their children, when they &s;tood in need of thy protection. Thine arm was &s;tretched forth for their help. Thou did&s;t call them to go, and it was of thy wi&s;dom that they did go, into a land where they were in captivity for an appoint|ed time. There, Lord, thou did&s;t ble&s;s them. Thou wa&s;t not forgetful of thy promi&s;e; but, notwith&s;tanding their rebellion, thou cau&s;ed&s;t them to multiply into an exceeding great nation; and when the time appointed was come, in the very hour which thou had&s;t appointed, notwith&s;tanding their frequent rebellion again&s;t thee, thou wa&s;t regardful of thy promi&s;e, and did&s;t deliver them. Thou did&s;t bring them out of Egypt with a mighty hand; thou did&s;t divide the Red Sea, that thine I&s;rael might pa&s;s through. Their enemies, pur&s;uing them, were overwhelmed in the deep, while they pa&s;&s;ed through dry &s;hod, &s;inging thy prai&s;es. Again they rebelled again&s;t thee, and thou did&s;t lead them about in a wa&s;te, howling wilderne&s;s; neverthele&s;s, thou did&s;t carry them like an eagle, and keep them as the apple of thine eye. Though thou did&s;t bring down thy judgments upon them, yet ju&s;tice was always tempered with
<PB N="7" REF="030279_0006_0FE59DB895D50128">mercy; and thou did&s;t never puni&s;h them as their &s;ins de&s;erved. Athougth, after forty years, thou did&s;t bring them into the land which thou had&s;t prepared for them; their enemies, though mighty, falling before them: there they wor&s;hipped thee, and there they enjoyed thy pre&s;ence; till at length thou did&s;t take thy pre&s;ence for a little time from them, and &s;uffered&s;t them to fall before their enemies. Neverthele&s;s, at the appointed time thou did&s;t re&s;tore them. They offended again and again; and were again and again captivated, and again delivered. They were under captivity, according to thy prophecies, &s;eventy years: but thou wa&s;t faithful, O God! and at the expiration of the appointed time, thou did&s;t &s;end thy &s;ervants of old to be their leaders; and, according to thy promi&s;e, did&s;t bring them again to their land; and thy temple was again re&s;tored to them. They continued there, in different &s;tates and conditions, for many years; till at length the Romans, the people whom thou had&s;t permitted to come, overpowered them, and the &s;ceptre depart|ed from Judah, and the lawgiver from between his feet. O Lord God! thou did&s;t &s;ay in thy word, that there &s;hould then appear a wonderful man upon earth: Lord, teach us what we &s;hould think of that man. Thou &s;cattered&s;t them abroad; at this day they have no prie&s;t, no &s;acrifice, no temple, nor can they wor&s;hip thee according to thy law. But thou ha&s;t promi&s;|ed that I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved in the Lord with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation. Let this day, O God! be the beginning of their de|liverance. Now, O God of gods, Light of lights, &s;hine down into our hearts, cha&s;e away the clouds of unbelief and igno|rance, and give us &s;aith in thee, as Abraham thy &s;ervant had. Thou did&s;t &s;ay to Abraham, "In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." Many have ari&s;en who have pretended to be this promi&s;ed &s;eed, and have proved otherwi&s;e; but there was a man who, when the &s;ceptre was about to depart, did great miracles, and the Jews them&s;elves bore witne&s;s of them. Teach us, O Lord! what we &s;hould think of that man. If he be the Me&s;&s;iah O God! let us believe in him. Lead us into all truth, teach us to under&s;tand thy word, and thine &s;hall be the glory. O Lord! as this is my birth-day, let it be the birth-day of thou&s;ands, and let thy pre&s;ence be &s;hewn to I&s;rael in a pecu|liar
<PB N="8" REF="030279_0007_0FE59840DB8902E0">manner to-day. Hear us, O God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of Jacob! and do more and better for us, poor unworthy Gentiles, but more e&s;pecially for thine ancient I&s;rael, thy dear people, the Jews, than we can a&s;k or think.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>AND IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED.</P>&mdash;<BIBL><HI>GEN.</HI> xxii. 18.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BLESSED be the God of Abraham for the glorious &s;ight which I now behold! Thou&s;ands of divers nations, Jews and Gentiles, are a&s;&s;embled beneath this roof to hear the word of God! O may the Spirit of the Almighty enable me to preach it faithfully, and may your hearts be opened cordially to receive it.</P>
<P>Gentile &s;inners, you are this day highly honoured with the pre&s;ence of a noble nation. Behold the ancient I&s;rael of God; and, con&s;cious of your own inferiority, reverence them as your &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Ye ancient I&s;rael of God, we view you with rapturous de|light and veneration; nor are we a&s;hamed to acknowledge your great &s;uperiority. Our forefathers, forgetting your high de|&s;cent, may have in&s;ulted you, but we di&s;claim their ba&s;e actions, and would atone for their faults by double humiliation. You are the lineal de&s;cendants of God's ancient cho&s;en people; we are the children of idolatrous and execrable Gentiles. To you were committed the lively oracles of God, while our fathers groped in ignorance, and peri&s;hed for lack of knowledge. Yet your fa|thers prayed for us; and we, prompted by gratitude, would im|itate their conduct, and &s;eek to do you good. Actuated by this motive, I, an unworthy worm, pre&s;ume this day to preach unto you the word of the Lord. Not that I am wi&s;er than you. No; I am only a poor child, completing this day my twentieth year; but convinced of my own inability to in&s;truct grey hairs, I earne&s;tly pray the Lord to be unto me a mouth and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>As I am &s;tanding before a company of Jews, among whom are many learned men, it might be expected by &s;ome that I &s;hould addre&s;s them in a learned manner. This, however, I cannot do; for I candidly confe&s;s, in the pre&s;ence of you all,
<PB N="10" REF="030279_0009_0FE59DBC52FC7558">that I under&s;tand no language but the Engli&s;h. Craving, there|fore, indulgence, if, in pronouncing Hebrew names, my accent &s;hould be improper, and entreating the mo&s;t candid attention whil&s;t I rea&s;on on the doctrines of this book with all po&s;&s;ible per&s;picuity and plainne&s;s&mdash;I enter on the great work before me with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>There is little occa&s;ion, I pre&s;ume, for acquainting this a&s;|&s;embly with the remarkable occurrence which &s;eems to be a prelude to the gracions promi&s;e in my text. For the &s;ake, however, of tho&s;e who are uninformed, &s;hould any &s;uch be here pre&s;ent, a brief recital may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>God having called Abraham from his native land into a &s;trange country, gave him the promi&s;e of a &s;on, from whom a numerous progeny &s;hould de&s;cend; tho' at that time, Abraham was an hundred years old, and Sarah, according to the cour&s;e of nature, pa&s;t child-bearing. Abraham believed in God; but &s;o far was Sarah from thinking &s;uch an event po&s;&s;ible, that when the promi&s;e was given, &s;he laugh&egrave;d, &s;aying with an air of incredulity, "Shall I bear a &s;on?" Neverthele&s;s, Sarah did conceive, and bear a &s;on to Abraham, in his old age, at the &s;et time of which God had &s;poken to him (Gen. xxi. 2:) and from him, thus miraculou&s;ly conceived, when the &s;prings of nature were dried up, the Me&s;&s;iah him&s;elf was to de&s;cend, in a man|ner as impo&s;&s;ible in the eye of &s;en&s;e, as a root could &s;pring up out of dry ground.</P>
<P>For the further trial of Abraham's faith, God &s;aith to him, when I&s;aac was grown up, "Take now thy &s;on, thy only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering, upon one of the moun|tains which I will tell thee of." The good man ro&s;e early in the morning, and taking his &s;on, and the things needful for the &s;acrifice, began his journey. On the third day, O! painful &s;ight! he lift up his eyes, and beheld the place afar off where his lamb mu&s;t bleed. O! a&s;toni&s;hing faith! that enabled him to proceed at the divine command, while nature's per&s;ua&s;ive voice, like the tempting &s;erpent, urges him to di&s;obey. But nature, already bleeding, receives another wound; for, as they went on both of them together, I&s;aac &s;aid, "My father; and he replied, Here am I, my &s;on. And he &s;aid, Behold the fire
<PB N="11" REF="030279_0010_0FE59DC0D5D61298">and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" And Abraham &s;aid, "My &s;on, God will provide him&s;elf a lamb for a burnt-offering." At &s;uch a que&s;tion what mu&s;t he feel! how difficult to &s;uppre&s;s the tears that were ready to bur&s;t from his eyes! "Ah! dear child, little do&s;t thou think what I am about to do. Thou art the lamb. My hand mu&s;t &s;ix in thy beloved brea&s;t the deadly &s;teel." He &s;truggles again&s;t the kill|ing thought, and per&s;everes. At length they reach the place. There Abraham builds the altar, and on the altar he lays the wood in order. He binds his &s;on, and lays him on the wood. Taking the fatal knife, he &s;tretches forth his hand, and &s;tands prepared to &s;lay his &s;on. O Abraham, forbear. If thy faith be deaf to nature's voice, li&s;ten one moment to what rea&s;on has to &s;ay. "Art thou not to be the father of many nations? Is it not &s;aid, "In I&s;aac &s;hall thy &s;eed be called?" How can the divine prediction be fulfilled if I&s;aac dies without a child? Drop, therefore, the knife, and let thy darling live." But no; the man of God obeys the voice of Heaven; and now, behold the &s;on of promi&s;e ready to receive the mortal wound. Ju&s;t at that in&s;tant the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do you any thing unto him; for now I know thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou has not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me. And Abraham looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns; and he went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the &s;tead of his &s;on. And the angel of the Lord called to him out of heaven a &s;econd time, and &s;aid, By my&s;elf have I &s;worn, &s;aith the Lord, for becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done this thing, and ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on, that in ble&s;&s;ing I will ble&s;s thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy &s;eed as the &s;tars of the heaven and as the &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore; and thy &s;eed &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the gate of his enemies. And," then follows the GRAND PROMISE, "In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>This promi&s;e is made to Abraham, that illu&s;trious character, whom Jews and Gentiles reverence, and whom God him&s;elf delighted to honour. His name was Ab-ram, mighty-father, but God changed it to Abraham, the father of multitudes, or nations, as it is &s;aid, Gen. xvii. 5. "the father of many nations
<PB N="12" REF="030279_0011_0FE59DC2DD3FF210">have I made thee." This could not be &s;poken of him in rela|tion to his progeny after the fle&s;h, for he was the father of I&s;ra|el only, a &s;ingle nation; it mu&s;t, therefore, de&s;ign that &s;pirit|ual race that &s;hould &s;pring from this SEED, in whom all the na|tions of the earth are to be ble&s;&s;ed. We join with you in de|nominating Abraham, by way of eminence, "the father of the faithful." How ju&s;tly he de&s;erves this title, may be inferred from what hath been &s;aid. Not becau&s;e he is either the author of faith, or the object of it, but becau&s;e his faith was, of all men's the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous: and as you are his children af|ter the fle&s;h, I pray God you may be imitators of his faithfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>He is likewi&s;e called "the friend of God;" the mo&s;t digni|fied appellation that ever was conferred on a mortal man. In con&s;equence of his friend&s;hip, he was admitted to the greate&s;t confidence and familiarity, in&s;omuch that God would not de|&s;troy the cities of the plain without fir&s;t acquainting him with his de&s;ign. "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" I grant that in the Canticles he calls his people collective|ly, friends; &s;aying, "Eat, O friends! and drink abundantly, O beloved!" but he never &s;pake to any individual of them but Abraham, in terms of intimacy like the&s;e.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h nation, being the natural po&s;terity of this faithful Abraham, this friend of God, and bearing in their countenan|ces the marks of their high de&s;cent, derive no &s;mall honour from this very circum&s;tance. The meane&s;t Jew has, in this re&s;pect, more dignity than the greate&s;t Princes; for kingly de&s;cent can|not be traced &s;o high, nor can the proude&s;t monarch upon earth boa&s;t of &s;uch noble progenitors. What warrior can be com|pared with David, or who, for wi&s;dom and riches, can vie with Solomon? Yet the&s;e, Oye Jews! were your ance&s;tors, and &s;o al&s;o were many prophets and kings, who&s;e names God him&s;elf has recorded with the highe&s;t honour, that they may be held in ev|erla&s;ting remembrance. If we Gentile &s;inners do not, in a man|ner, honour you as kings, and account our&s;elves your &s;ervants, we di&s;grace our profe&s;&s;ion. Your nation was once the glow and terror of the world, and though that glory is now no more, it would be &s;hameful in us to de&s;pi&s;e you; for the chiefe&s;t glory of your nation yet remains, that <HI>&s;eed</HI> of Abraham <HI>in whom all the nations of the earth are to be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030279_0012_0FE59DC46EE6F158">
The word <HI>&s;eed</HI> confines the promi&s;e to one family, and in|deed to one per&s;on, that is the Me&s;&s;iah; but the ble&s;&s;ing is un|to all, and upon all them that believe. Call us Gentile dogs, if you plea&s;e; we are &s;o, and the mo&s;t contemptible name is not too bad for us. Yet do not wi&s;h to exclude us from the ble&s;&s;|ings comprehended in this promi&s;e. We al&s;o hope for eternal happine&s;s through the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of Abraham, the MESSIAH; who we conceive is already come, and we ought not to look for anoth|er. This you doubt. This I &s;irmly believe. If I am wrong, may God convince me to day! O! convince me before this multitude, and let thy I&s;rael, if they are wrong, bow to the &s;ceptre of truth, that we may no longer be at variance, but all con&s;e&s;s the glory of God in the promi&s;ed &s;eed.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, candidly inquire into the&s;e three particu|lars: fir&s;t, Whether the Me&s;&s;iah be actually come; &s;econdly, If he be, who this Me&s;&s;iah is; and thirdly, What ble&s;&s;ings all nations derive from him?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, is the Me&s;&s;iah come? It appears to me that he is. In &s;upport of this I &s;hall adduce, though I am but a child in knowledge, four Scriptures, which I think are conclu&s;ive; wi&s;er men, I dart &s;ay, could bring a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age to which I &s;hall refer, you will find in the forty-ninth chapter of Gene&s;is, where Jacob, ble&s;&s;ing his &s;ons, pronounces the following on Judah: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren &s;hall prai&s;e; thy hand &s;hall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children &s;hall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my &s;on, thou art gone up; he &s;tooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who &s;hall rou&s;e him up? The &s;ceptre &s;hall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him &s;hall the gathering of the people be.</P>
<P>Setting a&s;ide all the needle&s;s objections of your nation con|cerning the tran&s;lation of the&s;e words, let us, for a moment, con&s;ider their import; for men of wi&s;dom and learning, like you, know that all objections of that &s;ort are merely cavils. Al|lowing the Hebrew word, which we tran&s;late <HI>&s;ceptre,</HI> to mean a rod, as you &s;ay, yet there is no doubt but it means a &s;taff or rod of power, not of affliction. This is plain from what follows in the &s;ame &s;entence&mdash;"nor a lawgiver from between his feet;"
<PB N="14" REF="030279_0013_0FE59DC6033F2570">for you cannot deny but the word rendered <HI>lawgiver,</HI> is prop|erly tran&s;lated; &s;o that if we leave out the word <HI>&s;ceptre,</HI> the meaning will be plain enough; namerly, that governing power &s;hall not depart from Judah till Shiloh come; but Judah governs no more&mdash;the &s;ceptre is departed. I &s;hall not attempt to prove the exact time when it did depart; you are much wi&s;er than I, and know much better than I can tell you. My arguments, that the &s;eeptre is now departed, and all knowledge of regal, &s;acerdo|tal and tribal de&s;cent utterly lo&s;t. Eighteen hundred years, nearly, hath Jeru&s;alem been de&s;troyed, nor is there a trace of &s;overeignty remaining, or the hope of it po&s;&s;ible. Are the&s;e things &s;o, or are they not? Have you a king, or have you not? Where is your lawgiver? Where is the knowledge of your tribes? I defy the mo&s;t learned Jew to tell me which of you is of Judah, which of Levi, or to what tribe he him&s;elf belongs. But this you all know, that the &s;ceptre is departed from Judah, and a lawgiver from between his feet. Then it follows, either that the unchanging God hath fled from his promi&s;e, or that Shiloh is come. You al&s;o know that about the time when the &s;ceptre departed, there appeared in the world a CERTAIN MAN, who was afterwards crucified at Jeru&s;alem; and that about that time many of your nation expected the Me&s;&s;iah; did they not? Let hi&s;tory, let your own writers be witne&s;&s;es. But if you will not believe that Shiloh is come, why do you pretend to believe this promi&s;e, &s;eeing, if he is not come, it cannot be true?</P>
<P>The next proof I &s;hall allege, is a pa&s;&s;age in the ninth chap|ter of Daniel; "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy peo|ple and upon thy holy city, to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and to make an end of &s;ins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to &s;eal up the vi&s;|ion and prophecy, and to anoint the mo&s;t holy. Know, there|fore, and under&s;tand, that from the going forth of the com|mandment to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;alem, unto the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince, &s;hall be &s;even weeks, and three&s;core and two weeks; the &s;treet &s;hall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after three&s;core and two weeks &s;hall Me&s;&s;iah be CUT OFF, (do you hear that, O ye Jews!) MESSIAH SHALL BE CUT OFF, but not for him&s;elf; and the people of the prince that &s;hall come &s;hall de&s;troy the city and the &s;anctuary; and the end
<PB N="15" REF="030279_0014_0FE59DCDD2909040">thereof &s;hall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war de&s;|olations are determined. And he &s;hall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the mid&s;t of the week he &s;hall cau&s;e the &s;acri&s;ice and the oblation to cea&s;e, and for the over|&s;preading of abominations he &s;hall make it de&s;olate, even until the con&s;ummation, and that determined &s;hall be poured upon the de&s;olate." You pay more re&s;pect to your Rabbies and their &s;ayings, than to God and his law. One of them hath pa&s;&s;ed a bitter cur&s;e on any one that dares to calculate the time of the Me&s;&s;iah's coming. He prays that his bowels may gu&s;h out. They are con&s;cious that he is come, and wi&s;h, by imprecations like this, to deter you from &s;earching for the truth; but this will not deter me. I am too young and unlearned to enter into accurate computations; but I appeal to the mo&s;t learned Jew, whether the&s;e &s;eventy jubilee weeks, or weeks of years, mu&s;t not have long &s;ince expired, and con&s;equently, whether the Me&s;|&s;iah mu&s;t not have appeared, and been cut off, as hi&s;tory reports? Seventy weeks of years amount to four hundred and ninety years. The period cannot be a&s;certained exactly when tho&s;e weeks commenced. Some fix one time, and &s;ome another. But that is immaterial. Let this &s;uffice, they are long &s;ince pa&s;t. The text &s;ays, "&s;eventy weeks are determined to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make an end of &s;ins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, (and who can bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, but an everla&s;ting God;) to &s;eal up the vi&s;ion and prophecy and to anoint the mo&s;t holy." Mo&s;t of you will agree that Me&s;&s;iah the Prince is here intended; and if not, you mu&s;t confe&s;s he is meant when his name is mentioned in the &s;ub&s;equent ver&s;es. "From the going forth of the commandment to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;alem, to Me&s;&s;iah the Prince, is &s;even weeks, and three&s;core and two weeks." Your own ma&s;ters, if they would, could calculate this time more exactly than I can. However, let me a&s;k your con|&s;ciences, whether about the time when the&s;e &s;eventy weeks drew to a conclu&s;ion, there was not a remarkable per&s;on who gave out that he was the Me&s;&s;iah; yea, whether many of your nation did not become his followers; and whether your fa|thers did not CUT OFF that per&s;on? as it is &s;aid, "the Me&s;&s;i|ah &s;hall be cut off, but not for him&s;elf." Al&s;o, whether he did
<PB N="16" REF="030279_0015_0FE59DCFAEC9E3D8">not pronounce at his death, "It is fini&s;hed?" After this is done, "The people of the prince that &s;hall come, &s;hall de&s;troy the city." Now you all know the city of Jeru&s;alem is here meant; but you will ob&s;erve the de&s;truction of it is not mentioned, till after mention is made of Me&s;&s;iah's being cut off. But who are the people of the prince that &s;hall come? Are they not the Romans? Did they not de&s;troy your city, and de&s;olate your nation? "To the end of the war de&s;olations are determined." Thou&s;ands, yea, tens of thou&s;ands of your countrymen, accord|ing to Jo&s;ephus, peri&s;hed in that bloody war; the country was made a de&s;olation, and &s;o it remains to this day. But you will ob&s;erve, that the Me&s;&s;iah was to be cut off, before the people of the prince &s;hould come and de&s;troy your city. But Jeru&s;a|&s;alem is de&s;troyed, therefore the Me&s;&s;iah is cut off. Why, O Jews, why will you be blinded through unbelief? Why will you &s;hut your eyes again&s;t the clear &s;hining of truth? Fir&s;t, Me&s;&s;iah mu&s;t be cut off; and then in con&s;equence of that, the Romans &s;hall come, and de&s;troy your city. Is Jeru&s;alem de|&s;troyed, or is it not? It is de&s;troyed; and your people remain, to this day, &s;catteted up and down upon the face of the earth. God's promi&s;es can never fail. It is therefore in vain for you to &s;ay, your &s;infulne&s;s hinders their fulfilment, This is not a conditional promi&s;e, but it is po&s;itive: "Seventy weeks are DETERMINED; the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hall be cut off." When I&s;rael was in Egypt, and the time came when God had promi&s;ed to deliver them, their unworthine&s;s did not make God unfaithful; for he brought them out the <HI>&s;elf-&s;ame</HI> night: and &s;hall the &s;ev|enty weeks expire, and &s;hall not the Me&s;&s;iah come?</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, "He &s;hall confirm the covenant with MANY, for one week, that is, &s;even years, and in the MIDST OF THE WEEK, he &s;hall cau&s;e the &s;acrifice and oblation to cea&s;e." That is, this Me&s;&s;iah, whoever he is, &s;hall confirm the covenant of God with your fathers concerning him&s;elf, by many <HI>infallible</HI> miracles, as well as by his life and doctrines. "And in the mid&s;t of the week," that is, in about three years and a half af|ter he begins his work of confirming his covenant, "he &s;hall cau&s;e the &s;acrifice and oblation to cea&s;e." I &s;uppo&s;e this means, that being cut off, not for him&s;elf, but as a &s;acrifice for the people, he &s;hall, by that one offering of him&s;elf, render his
<PB N="17" REF="030279_0016_0FE59DD14537AD98">work perfect, and make all tho&s;e &s;acrifices and oblations of the ceremonial law ineffectual; for types are like &s;caffolding, which is taken down when the building is completed.</P>
<P>I remember, concerning that remarkable per&s;on who ap|peared about the time the&s;e &s;eventy weeks were expired, that he wrought many miracles, and con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted that he was the Me&s;&s;iah; yea, that he was <HI>cut off</HI> in about three years and a half after he had begun preaching; that his death happened about the time of the evening &s;acrifice, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing that he groaned his la&s;t at the very moment the &s;eventy weeks of Daniel were completed, as the angel &s;pake to him, about the time of the evening oblation.</P>
<P>The third pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall produce, you will find written in the fifth chapter of Micah: "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thou&s;ands of Judah, yet out of thee &s;hall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in I&s;ra|el; who&s;e goings forth have been from of old, from everla&s;t|ing." That the Me&s;&s;iah is here &s;poken of, and the place of his nativity pointed out, the Jews them&s;elves acknowledge; for when Herod inquired where the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be born, the chief prie&s;ts and &s;cribes an&s;wered, in Bethlehern of Judah, al|leging this prophecy in proof. That this prophecy might be fulfilled, God cau&s;ed Cae&s;ar to make a decree that the whole land &s;hould be regi&s;tered; for which purpo&s;e all were com|manded to go to their own city. Jo&s;eph, being of the family of David, went to Bethlehem, where Je&s;us was born; declar|ing by his enrollment, of what family he was, and likewi&s;e ful|filling the words of this prophecy. Where is Bethlehem now? From thence, according to your own teachers, Me&s;&s;iah is to come. But Bethlehem is de&s;troyed: therefore Me&s;&s;iah is come. Jeru&s;alem is no more; Bethlehem is no more; there|fore, either this prophecy <HI>cannot</HI> be fulfilled, or it is already ful|filled; for, "out of thee &s;hall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in I&s;rael;" he &s;hall go out from me; do the work which he hath undertaken, and come to me again. "There|fore will he give them up, until the time that &s;he which travail|eth hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren &s;hall return unto the children of I&s;rael." I cannot tell how you may interpret this text; but I &s;uppo&s;e it partly means that I&s;rael
<PB N="18" REF="030279_0017_0FE59DD2D7D793A0">&s;hall be given up, till the fullne&s;s of the Gentiles &s;hall come in. Then &s;hall all I&s;rael confe&s;s the Me&s;&s;iah, and be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation. When that glorious event will take place, God only knows; but I tru&s;t it is not far off. I think it is <HI>very</HI> near: and he alone who ruleth above, knows whether this day may not be the beginning of that glorious &s;ea&s;on; and whether the conver&s;ion of the Jews may not be the means of &s;preading the Go&s;pel from pole to pole.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;cripture, from which I &s;hall argue the point, is contained in the third chapter of Malachi: "Behold, I will &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger, and he &s;hall propare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye &s;eek &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his temple, even the Me&s;&s;enger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he &s;hall come, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts." To this I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a pa&s;&s;age in Haggai: "And I will &s;hake all nations, and the De|&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come; and I will fill this hou&s;e with glo|ry, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts. The &s;ilver is mine, and the gold is mine, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts. The glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hall be greater than of the former, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts: and in this place will I give peace, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts." I &s;hall argue from both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages at once. Now there is no Jew but will acknowledge that the &s;econd temple, built by Zerubbabel, was &s;o far inferior to that of Solomon, that there was no compari&s;on between them; for though Herod beauti|fied this &s;econd temple, and lavi&s;hed va&s;t &s;ums upon it, yet it was not in Herod's power to make it like Solomon's in glory. Compared with that, it was contemptible; but God, for the comfort of his people, here promi&s;es that its glory &s;hall exceed the glory of the former. "For the Lord whom ye &s;eek &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his temple&mdash;even the De&s;ire, or de&s;irable Object, of ALL nations." And it is evident that the pre&s;ence of the Me&s;&s;iah, God incarnate, was, according to this promi&s;e, to give it that &s;uperior glory.</P>
<P>Now, O Jews! your temple is de&s;troyed, and you can have no rea&s;onable expectation of another. How then can this prom|i&s;e be fulfilled, if it is not already fulfilled? How can the Me&s;|&s;enger of the covenant come into that temple which is now de|&s;troyed? But it is evident it was not to be de&s;troyed till he had come into it. As, therefore, it is de&s;troyed, the Me&s;&s;enger, the
<PB N="19" REF="030279_0018_0FE59DDA4D6E7618">De&s;ire of all nations, mu&s;t have already come into it. It cannot be &s;poken of a third temple, for God confined the promi&s;e to the &s;econd: "I will fill THIS hou&s;e with glory." And again, "The glory of this LATTER HOUSE &s;hall be greater than of the former."</P>
<P>O Jews! do ye not now believe? Shall God promi&s;e, and &s;hall he not perform? Is he &s;lack concerning his promi&s;e? Will the God of truth amu&s;e you with fal&s;ity? By no means: all his promi&s;es &s;hall be fulfilled, without the delay of a moment. If he &s;aid the Me&s;&s;enger &s;hould come to his temple, depend up|on it he is come, as the Lord hath &s;aid. May God Almighty enlighten you, that you may &s;ee the meaning of the&s;e Scriptures.</P>
<P>It is evident, whoever the Me&s;&s;iah is, that he is come: and nothing but blindne&s;s and unbelief, which have happened unto I&s;rael, can engage them to look for another. All their hopes, therefore, like the pa&s;t, mu&s;t end in confu&s;ion, till they return unto him from whom they have &s;o greatly departed. But you will argue, that becau&s;e of your &s;infulne&s;s, God hath withheld his promi&s;e for a time. Was God ever wont to do &s;o? When he promi&s;ed you deliverance from Egypt, did he not deliver you the &s;elf-&s;ame night as he had promi&s;ed? did he not bring you forth with a mighty hand&mdash;lead you through the Red Sea, and overwhelm your pur&s;uers in the mighty deep? Did he not lead you forty years through a wa&s;te howling wilderne&s;s? and, notwith&s;tanding your rebellion, brought you into the promi&s;ed land? If then, God hath been faithful in le&s;&s;er matters, &s;hall he not keep his word concerning the Me&s;&s;iah? Yes, he hath kept his word, and Me&s;&s;iah is come. But who is the Me&s;&s;i|ah? This brings me to inquire, as I propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>Secondly, who the Me&s;&s;iah is? And this I &s;hall do by inve&s;|tigating in whom is verified all that the prophets had foretold concerning him. To this end, I &s;hall direct your attention to many pa&s;&s;ages in the book of God. Look into the twenty-&s;econd P&s;alm, and read the fir&s;t ver&s;e. "My God! my God! why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?" The&s;e words are the language of prophecy, and &s;eem to look forward to &s;omething remark|able. They were &s;poken by Je&s;us of Nazareth, when he was in the agonies of death, and thou&s;ands of the Jews heard him. Read al&s;o the 7th and 8th ver&s;es of the &s;ame P&s;alm. "All they that &s;ee me laugh me to &s;corn: they &s;hoot out the lip; they
<PB N="20" REF="030279_0019_0FE59DDC253E7450">&s;hake the head, &s;aying, He tru&s;ted in the Lord, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, &s;eeing he delighted in him." The&s;e words were al&s;o &s;poken by the multitude, in deri&s;ion of that &s;ame per&s;on, while he hung on the cro&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxvii. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the 14th ver&s;e it is &s;aid, "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint." This &s;eems to allude to the dread|ful death of crucifixion, which, by the extending of the body and the &s;udden jerk it &s;u&s;tained when the cro&s;s was put down into the hole dug for that purpo&s;e, mu&s;t &s;ometimes di&s;locate the limbs; and perhaps it was &s;o with Je&s;us of Nazareth; but it is very remarkable concerning him, that a bone of him was not broken. Ver&s;e the 15th &s;ays, "my &s;trength is dried up like a pot&s;herd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou ha&s;t brought me into the du&s;t of death." Who can the P&s;almi&s;t be &s;peaking of? There is &s;omething very &s;triking in the words. Whoever he is &s;peaking of, &s;eems to be a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief. His &s;orrows &s;eem like a burning heat, which hath dried up his &s;trength, and cau&s;ed a parching thir&s;t. I recollect al&s;o another pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, which &s;ays, "They gave me al&s;o another pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, which &s;ays, "They gave me al&s;o gall for my meat, and in my thir&s;t they gave me vinegar to drink."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxix. 21.</NOTE> Is it not very &s;urpring that all this &s;hould be fulfilled in Je&s;us of Nazareth? for they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvii. 48.

O my God what do I &s;ee?&mdash;"THEY PIERCED MY MANDS AND MY FEET." Ju&s;t &s;o was it done to Je&s;us of Naz|areth; and of a truth he was the Son of God&mdash;he is the Me&s;&s;iah that was to come.

And the Lord &s;aid unto me, ca&s;t it unto the porter; a goodly price that I was prized at of them.

Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our &s;orrows; yet we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God, and afflicted. But he was <HI>wounded</HI> for our tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, he was <HI>brui&s;ed</HI> for our iniquities; the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him; and with <HI>his &s;tripes</HI> we are heal|ed. All we, like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppre&s;&s;ed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb; &s;o he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from pri&s;on and from judgment, and who &s;hall declare his generation; for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;tricken. And he made his grave with the wick|ed, and with the rich in his death; becau&s;e he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth." According to the acknowledgment of one of your own teachers, this prophecy hampers you more than any other; and &s;ome of you have wi&s;hed it had not been written, or that it were expunged from the Old Te&s;tament writings. It is a rule among &s;ome of you, that you mu&s;t believe all your teachers. Many of them have attempted to explain this Scripture; and mo&s;t of them have differed in their &s;entiments concerning it. Some have affirmed it relates to David, &s;ome to Jo&s;hua, &s;ome to Zechariah, and others to Zerubbabel. But, agreeably to your own rule, you mu&s;t believe them all. Now one of them has explained it as referring to the Me&s;&s;iah. Why then do ye not believe him? And he has tran&s;lated the words, "&s;mitten of God and afflicted." <HI>God him&s;elf was &s;mitten and humbled.</HI> But
<PB N="23" REF="030279_0022_0FE59DE519AF39D0">wi&s;e men, like you, will not be blind followers of any man's opinion. I a&s;k you, therefore, of whom doth the Prophet here &s;peak? You know, O Jews! that he &s;peaks of the Me&s;&s;iah, who was "cut off" for your &s;ins&mdash;"who made his grave with the wicked"&mdash;was crucified between two thieves, "and with the rich in his death;" for he was buried in the grave of a rich man. O Jews! through this man only, can you have hope of everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, "I will not believe in a crucified God, a God that hath been hanged." But why not? becau&s;e the veil is &s;till upon your hearts; and unle&s;s the Great God is plea&s;ed to remove it, I know that the fooli&s;hne&s;s of my preach|ing will never convince you. So you &s;ay, you will not have a crucified Saviour? What! not have him whom the P&s;almi&s;t per&s;onates, when he &s;ays, "They pierced my hands and my feet." What! not believe in him "who hath borne your &s;or|rows;" and, as the Prophet &s;peaks, "ca&s;t your &s;ins into the depths of the &s;ea?" Will you not have this Prince to reign over you? But you &s;ay, "it was never de&s;igned that your Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be a &s;ufferer." You certainly know otherwi&s;e; for it was &s;ore-ordained that he &s;hould be cut off&mdash;that the &s;word &s;hould awake, and &s;mite the &s;hepherd, God's equal, and that the &s;heep &s;hould be &s;cattered, and all with a view that the &s;aying might be verified, "I have trodden the wine-pre&s;s alone, and of the people there was none with me." But who is God's equal? Is the wi&s;e&s;t Prophet&mdash;is the greate&s;t mon|arch, equal with the great God? Nay, is the highe&s;t arch|angel in heaven his equal? No.&mdash;You &s;hudder to entertain &s;uch an idea. But the text &s;ays, "again&s;t the MAN that is my FELLOW, my EQUAL;" and this is no other than that "<HI>Child</HI> which &s;hould be born, that <HI>Son</HI> which &s;hould be given, the Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, the Mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ix. 6.</NOTE> "The God-man, the Me&s;&s;iah, the &s;eed of the woman which hath brui&s;ed the &s;crpent's head; and in whom all the nations of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed." But your Me&s;&s;iah is &s;poken of in Scripture as a <HI>prophet, prie&s;t,</HI> and <HI>king.</HI> He is a <HI>prophet.</HI> "I will rai&s;e them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my word in his

And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that whoever will not heark|en unto my words, which he &s;hall &s;peak in my name, I will require it of him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 18.</NOTE> This prophet is to be "rai&s;ed up from among their brethren." Je&s;us of Nazareth an&s;wers to the char|acter &s;o far. He was born a Jew, of the &s;eed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the hou&s;e of David, in Bethlehem of Ju|dah. He is, moreover, to be like Mo&s;es in meekne&s;s; "he was as a lamb dumb before the &s;hcarers."&mdash;In power and working miracles, the winds and the waves obey him; he di&s;cerned the thoughts, rai&s;ed the dead, and healed all manner of di&s;ea&s;es; And his miracles were not merely as marvellous as tho&s;e which Mo&s;es wrought, but va&s;tly more a&s;toni&s;hing. Some of you, however, will &s;ay, it was all delu&s;ion, and nothing better than enchantment. But an a&s;&s;ertion is not a proof. You al&s;o &s;ay, that he obtained the power of working miracles, by &s;tealing the great name of JEHOVAH, out of the temple. But in &s;aying this; you do in effect &s;ay, either that he overpower|ed God, and &s;o &s;tole the name again&s;t his will, or that God was carele&s;s about it; or that being willing he &s;hould take it, &s;et his &s;eal to a lie, and thus &s;uffered thou&s;ands of poor &s;inners to be deluded. But, I hope, you will be di&s;po&s;ed to confe&s;s the truth, that this is the very prophet which God had &s;o long promi&s;ed. If he had not been the anointed of the Lord, never, never would tho&s;e miracles have been wrought which &s;o clear|ly evince that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah. Je&s;us ca&s;t out devils; and if Satan ca&s;t out Satan, his kingdom cannot &s;tand; but evil &s;pirits them&s;elves confe&s;s, "Thou art the Holy One of God;" and they a&s;k, "Art thou come to torment us before the time?" They had no power to enter into the &s;wine till they had fir&s;t obtained his permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The la&s;t proof that Je&s;us is that prophet which was to ari&s;e, you will find in the book of Deuteronomy, "When a Proph|et &s;peaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pa&s;s, that is the thing which the Lord hath not &s;poken."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 22.</NOTE> But it hath not been &s;o with our Prophet. He pre|dicted concerning Jeru&s;alem, the three-walled city, that it &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and that "one &s;tone of the temple &s;hould
<PB N="25" REF="030279_0024_0FE59DE8C40E40F8">not be left upon another, that &s;hould not be thrown down." All the efforts of wicked men to rebuild it have proved abor|tive, and the place where it once &s;tood can &s;carcely be a&s;cer|tained. He al&s;o foretold, that "in the latter days fal&s;e proph|ets &s;hould ari&s;e, and deceive many." That prediction is now fulfilling. He al&s;o foretold his own death, and various other things, which we cannot now mention, all of which have been, or will be, exactly accompli&s;hed. And as Mo&s;es in|&s;tructed the people, &s;o did Chri&s;t; and particularly in the law of love. Is it not declared, "He that will not hearken to my words, which he &s;hall &s;peak, I will require it of him." There appears to be &s;omething more implied than &s;poken in this &s;en|tence. I am ready to believe it refers to the bleeding &s;orrows of your nation for rejecting the Me&s;&s;iah: and till you repent, and turn unto him, your wounds will not be healed. Come, dear Jews, come and learn of our Prophet and yours. He will teach you the meaning of all your types and &s;hadows. He will &s;hew you the &s;pirituality of the moral law, and how you may be delivered from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>Your Me&s;&s;iah is a <HI>prie&s;t</HI> as well as a prophet. "The Lord hath &s;worn, and will not repent: thou art a prie&s;t forever after the order of Melchizedek."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cx. 4.</NOTE> He is the great, the everla&s;ting High Prie&s;t of I&s;rael. Does every high prie&s;t offer a &s;acrifice? What doth he &s;ay? "Sacrifice and offering thou did&s;t not de&s;ire; burnt-offering, and &s;in-offering ha&s;t thou not required. Then &s;aid I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God!"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xi. 6-8.</NOTE> And he offered not the blood of bulls and goats, but his own blood. "Thou ha&s;t made his &s;oul," &s;aith I&s;aiah, "a &s;acrifice for &s;in:" and by that one offering he hath forever perfected them that believe. And now, "The Lord is gone up with a &s;hout"&mdash;he is entered into the Holy of Holies&mdash;the heaven of heavens, where he now appears "making interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. liii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our Je&s;us of Nazareth is al&s;o a <HI>king.</HI> "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! &s;hout, O daughter of Jeru&s;alem! behold, thy <HI>King</HI> cometh unto thee: he is ju&s;t, and having &s;alvation; lowly, and riding upon an a&s;s, and upon a colt the foal of an a&s;s."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Zech. ix. 9.</NOTE> You expect your king to appear like a conquering Alex|ander, &s;urrounded with great wordly &s;plendor: but hear, O ye

But it was not a great while after, that the&s;e very men, many of them, however, exclaimed, with the mo&s;t im|placable malice, "Crucify him! crucify him!" What! cru|cify your King? Yes, O Jews! and you, of the pre&s;ent gen|eration, reject that very King. Be a&s;&s;ured, notwith&s;tanding, that "God has &s;et him upon his holy hill of Sion," and &s;olemnly &s;aid, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

<P>There is one thing I might have mentioned before, but will not omit it in this place. The Scriptures not only predict the death of Chri&s;t, but his re&s;urrection al&s;o. Jonah's deliverance from the whale's belly was an emblem of this; and the P&s;alm|i&s;t, in the per&s;on of the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;ays, "Thou wilt not leave my &s;oul in hell," the place of the dead, "neither wilt thou &s;uf|fer <HI>thine Holy One</HI> to &s;ee corruption."<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xvi. 10.</NOTE> And, as though he were addre&s;&s;ing him, "Thou ha&s;t a&s;cended on high, thou ha&s;t led captivity captive; thou ha&s;t received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious al&s;o, that the Lord God might dwell among them."<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxviii. 18.</NOTE> But who is a&s;cended? Why, "God hath gone up with a &s;hout, and our Lord with the &s;ound of a trumpet." But
<PB N="27" REF="030279_0026_0FE59DF24D3C6998">before he a&s;cends, he mu&s;t de&s;cend; and you all very well know that God, as a Spirit, who fills every place, cannot be &s;aid to a&s;cend or de&s;cend: it is, without doubt, therefore, the incar|nate God who is here &s;poken of; the man who groaned on Calvary&mdash;ro&s;e from the dead the third day, and, by many in|fallible proofs, manife&s;ted him&s;elf to be the ri&s;en Saviour; and then, after forty days, in the pre&s;ence of a great multi|tude, was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their &s;ight.</P>
<P>But all this, O Jews! you &s;tumble at. But though a "&s;tone of &s;tumbling, and a rock of offence to both the hou&s;es of I&s;rael,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. viii. 14.</NOTE> he is, neverthele&s;s, the foundation, the tried &s;tone, the precious corner-&s;tone, which God hath laid in Sion;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxviii. 16.</NOTE> nor is there &s;al|vation in any other. Dear Jews! are you not convinced? Behold the rocks, the elements, are your in&s;tructors! for, at the death of Je&s;us, the earth trembled&mdash;the rocks were rent&mdash;the graves were opened&mdash;many &s;hrouded bodies aro&s;e from their &s;epul|chres&mdash;the &s;un withheld its wonted light, and a tenfold dark|ne&s;s enveloped the face of day. Diony&s;ius, a heathen philo&s;o|pher, beholding this dreadful fight, and knowing it to be con|trary to the common cour&s;e of nature, for an eclip&s;e of the &s;un to happen at the time of the full moon, is reported to have ex|claimed, "Either the frame of nature is di&s;&s;olving, or the God of nature &s;uffers." And when I tell you that this man was after|wards a convert to Chri&s;tianity, it may, perhaps, give energy to the language he then uttered. Now, if the things I have been &s;ay|ing concerning Je&s;us of Nazareth be not true, why did not &s;ome writers of that day, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening their evidence, as &s;ome of them have done, contradict them at the time they were fir&s;t propagated? Jo&s;ephus, your own hi&s;torian, &s;o far from de|nying what I have been preaching, &s;eems to be half a convert. Hear what he &s;ays upon this point. "About this time there was one Je&s;us a <HI>wi&s;e man,</HI> if a <HI>man</HI> he may be called, who was a great worker of miracles, and a teacher of tho&s;e that were cu|rious and de&s;irous to learn the truth; and he had a <HI>great many</HI> followers, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This was the Chri&s;t that was accu&s;ed by the princes and great men of our nation. Pilate delivered him up to the cro&s;s; and all this notwith&s;tanding, tho&s;e that loved him at fir&s;t did not for&s;ake him. He was &s;een
<PB N="28" REF="030279_0027_0FE59DF3DFCEE608">alive again the third day after his crucifixion, as had been fore|told, with a thou&s;and other things, by &s;everal prophets, and there are a &s;ort of people who, to this day, bear the name of Chri&s;tians, as owning him for their head."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;ephus, book 18. ch. iii.</NOTE> Who can with|&s;tand &s;uch evidence? Can you, O ye Jews! No; I am firmly per&s;uaded that many, I had almo&s;t &s;aid every one of you, are fully convinced that the Me&s;&s;iah is come, and that Je&s;us of Nazareth is that Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the third thing propo&s;ed, the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed to be derived from him. "In thy &s;eed &s;hall all na|tions of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." I hope you will excu&s;e my brevity on this head, as I have preached till I have nearly ex|hau&s;ted all my &s;trength. There is a &s;weet promi&s;e for you, my dear Jews, in the book of I&s;aiah,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xi. 10</NOTE> where the prophet &s;peaks of the Root of Je&s;&s;e, which you know is the Me&s;&s;iah, as "&s;tanding for an en&s;ign of the people, and &s;ays, to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious; and in that day the Lord &s;hall &s;et his hand again the &s;econd time to gather you from the nations where you are di&s;per&s;ed." You &s;ay you are not re&s;tored from your former captivity; but that is non|&s;en&s;e. God had fixed a time to deliver you, and he was faith|ful to his word. He never was wont to puni&s;h even for the &s;in of idolatry, but to the third or fourth generation. What then hath I&s;rael done, that he &s;hould ca&s;t them off &s;o long? O Jews! you have rejected the Me&s;&s;iah&mdash;that is the rea&s;on; and to this day you ob&s;tinately reject him. But if you now believe, the cur&s;e &s;hall be removed, and you &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him. Pray do not any longer reject him who is the only hope of I&s;rael; he waits to be gracious to you, and to ble&s;s you; but he cannot unle&s;s you believe in him. It is a truth mo&s;t certain, that the Jews are pre&s;erved a di&s;tinct people for the purpo&s;e of accom|pli&s;hing a variety of promi&s;es, and that when the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles is brought in, <HI>all</HI> I&s;rael will turn to the Lord Me&s;&s;iah; and probably their conver&s;ion will be the great means of ef|fecting the univer&s;al &s;pread of the Go&s;pel. I am certain, how|ever, that "God hath not ca&s;t away his people whom he fore|knew." It is evident from their pre&s;ent condition, which is nothing le&s;s than a &s;tanding miracle, that they are pre&s;erved
<PB N="29" REF="030279_0028_0FE59DF5739041A0">for &s;ome very extraordinary event. Never did any other peo|ple &s;ub&s;i&s;t, for a &s;ingle century only, wholly &s;eparate from their conquerors: Never did any other people, di&s;per&s;ed through &s;o many nations, continue as with a wall of fire round about them, not for one age merely, but for thou&s;ands of years. Look at a Jew, and you &s;ee a miracle; his nation is &s;tamped on his coun|tenance; and it is an honourable nation, Look at a Jew, and you &s;ee a man tenacious of the traditions of his fathers; but incapable of obeying one of the ordinances of Mo&s;es; without a <HI>temple,</HI> without a <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> without a <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> or a capability of offering to God an acceptable &s;ervice. Look at a Jew, and you are a witne&s;s of the accompli&s;hment of all the threatenings of Mo&s;es and the prophets. Behold a Jew, and you &s;ee an expect|ant of the fulfilment of the Scriptures, and a monument of their veracity; for the time will come, I hope it is near, when all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved. "I will make an end of all nations, but I never will make a full end of thee." And how happy I &s;hall be, if God is plea&s;ed to make my words the beginning of &s;al|vation to but one of Abraham's &s;eed! that the Redeemer may come to him from Sion, and turn away ungodline&s;s from I&s;rael.</P>
<P>And now, Sirs, what &s;ay you? Have I &s;poken to you, though in great weakne&s;s, yet the words of truth? If I have been un|faithful, may I not &s;peak another word! But if I have di&s;played the truth of God, why, poor &s;inners, will ye be &s;till blinded? I am as certain, as that this book of God is given by in&s;piration, that many of your nation are convinced that our Je&s;us is the promi&s;ed &s;eed; for &s;ome of your teachers have exhorted their friends, when on their dying-beds, to believe in the &s;ame Me&s;&s;iah which Chri&s;tians acknowledge; and yet the&s;e men, in public, will deny that he is the Me&s;&s;iah. What does all this prove, but that they &s;tubbornly re&s;i&s;t the light, and &s;tifle the convic|tions of their con&s;cience? I am per&s;uaded that many of you are convinced of the truth of what I have been &s;aying; but you are attached to your old religion, you are aver&s;e to the idea of changing it, and &s;o you reject the coun&s;el of God, and the only Me&s;&s;iah. Some of you are learned men. Search the Scriptures. You think you under&s;tand them better than we Gentiles do; but, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, there are many poor, un|learned, Gentile Chri&s;tians, who can better explain the types
<PB N="30" REF="030279_0029_0FE59DF7CBA7D748">and &s;hadows of your law, than the mo&s;t learned of the Jews. What &s;ay you to the&s;e things? If Je&s;us be not the Me&s;&s;iah, why were the prophecies &s;o exactly fulfilled in him? If you will not believe in Je&s;us, do not believe your prophets. If you want another Saviour, &s;hew us another law. If you reject Je|&s;us, reject Mo&s;es al&s;o; for Mo&s;es &s;pake of him.</P>
<P>Je&s;us is <HI>my</HI> Saviour; my &s;oul relies on him. And though he is the &s;tone which is "&s;et at nought by you builders, he is, neverthele&s;s, the head-&s;tone of the corner. Neither is there &s;alvation in any other." If you reject him, you reject ever|la&s;ting life; you are condemned by your own law, being in|capable of wor&s;hipping God as that law requires; you have not the benediction pronounced upon you, for none was per|mitted to pronounce it but the high prie&s;t. But in Je&s;us all nations &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed, Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles, among whom you dwell, believe in Je&s;us, and are ble&s;&s;ed in him; and &s;hould you a&s;k, I am &s;ure they would tell you, that they never knew what true joy and happine&s;s meant, till they believed in him. But, perhaps, you are a&s;hamed to acknowl|edge him. Why &s;o? You will not be alone; others have done it before you. There was Xeres the Jew, who&s;e book I now hold up; he is a witne&s;s again&s;t you. He was convert|ed to the Chri&s;tian faith in 1710, and has tran&s;lated many pa&s;&s;ages of your Hebrew Bible, and proved, from your own books, that Je&s;us is the true Me&s;&s;iah. O may the Spirit of God di&s;po&s;e you to follow his example! And then &s;hall you be completely ble&s;&s;ed in time, and to eternity.</P>
<P>The God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Ja|cob, look down upon you with complacency, and enlighen your dark under&s;tandings; and may you become witne&s;&s;es with me, that Je&s;us of Nazareth is the true Me&s;&s;iah!</P>

<P>A HAND-BILL of Brothers's Prophecies having been ju&s;t given to me by a Jew, I beg for a moment your farther attention.</P>
<P>MEN OF ISRAEL&mdash;Many of you object to the embracing Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e there are among&s;t us &s;o many &s;ects and parties. But, let me candidly a&s;k you, were there not many parties and &s;ects among your&s;elves in ancient days? Were there not Phari&s;ees, Sadducees, Herodians, and many others which I cannot enumerate? A per&s;on has put into my hand a paper re&s;pect|ing the prophecies of Brothers; but I give no &s;ort of credit to the whims of &s;uch a madman. I con&s;ider him, neverthele&s;s, as a &s;triking proof of the in|&s;piration of the New Te&s;tament; which has expre&s;sly foretold that, "in the latter days, many fal&s;e prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall <HI>deceive many.</HI>" If any thing be predicted, and it comes to pa&s;s, agreeably to the time foretold, you may have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe it; but when a man has the confidence to prophe&s;y what is never accompli&s;hed, you are in duty bound to reject him as an impo&s;tor. The prophecies of this enthu&s;ia&s;t are not fulfilled, nor ever will be. He is, undoubtedly, one of tho&s;e fal&s;e prophets the Scriptures &s;peak of; and as <HI>he</HI> hath ari&s;en, be not &s;urpri&s;ed if you hear of many more. Their preten&s;ions do but concur, though without de&s;ign, to evince the authenticity of that Go&s;pel, which was preached by the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us of Nazareth.</P>
<P>The Lord God of Abraham ble&s;s you all.</P>

<HEAD>PRAYER after Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>O LORD God of Abraham! do thou be plea&s;ed to command thy ble&s;&s;ing. Do thou now un&s;eal the dark things of prophecy, and give us a &s;aving acquaintance with all the truths of thy holy word. None can under&s;tand them aright, but as thou art plea&s;ed to teach them. Lord, do thou &s;hew to this people that Je&s;us of Nazareth is the Me&s;&s;iah; &s;hew them that he is the King that reigns in Zion, and that he &s;hall reign till all his enemies are under his feet. Do thou take the veil from all our hearts, thou dear Lamb of God, who was crucified for our &s;ins. At thy death the &s;un was darkened, the rocks were &s;haken, the graves were opened, and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. O! rend thou the veil from the hearts of thy dear I&s;rael now before thee; let them be no longer deluded, but &s;ave them with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation. O Lord! di&s;mi&s;s them and us with thy divine ble&s;&s;ing, for the alone &s;ake of Me&s;&s;iah, who was cut off for our &s;ins, who was rai&s;ed from the dead for our ju&s;tification, and who ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for us. Amen.</P>
<P>May the peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, come down from heaven into all your hearts! May the Holy Spirit, by his &s;acred illuminations, lead you into all truth; un|fold to you the my&s;terious words of prophecy, and cau&s;e you to believe in that Saviour whom your fathers crucified! Then may you join with us Gentiles, in a&s;cribing to him, with the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t, everla&s;ting prai&s;es. Amen.</P>
