<HEAD>THE CLAIM. TO THE COMMISSIONERS For carrying into effect the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, concluded between his Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States of America, the Nineteenth day of November, 1794,</HEAD>
<OPENER>THE MEMORIAL of William Cunningham, Pe|ter Murdoch, James Robi&s;on, and John Hamil|ton, Junior, &s;urviving partners of Andrew Coch|rane, William Cunningham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Peter Murdoch, James Robi&s;on, Wil|liam Hender&s;on, William Reid, and John Hamil|ton, Junior,
<HI>RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH,</HI></OPENER>
<P>THAT the &s;aid Andrew Cochran, William Cunningham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Pe|ter Murdoch, James Robi&s;on, William Hender&s;on, William Reid and John Hamilton, junior, were &s;ubjects of his Britannic Maje&s;ty carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s under the firm of William Cunningham and com|pany, and that the &s;aid William Cunningham, Peter
<PB N="4" REF="034906_0003_0FFF9323EF8CB6D8">
Murdoch, James Robi&s;on and John Hamilton, jun|ior, are the &s;urvivors of the &s;aid firm.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts further beg leave to &s;hew, that for many years previous to the fourth day of July one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, they carried on exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s as merchants in the then colony, now &s;tate of Virginia, and had e&s;tab|li&s;hed &s;everal con&s;iderable &s;tores in that country un|der the management and direction of different fact|ors and agents, among others the &s;tore called Wil|liam Cunningham and company's Brun&s;wick Store, the accounts of which will be herein after more par|ticularly mentioned.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts further beg leave to &s;tate and &s;hew, that from the earlie&s;t &s;ettlement of Virginia, the inhabitants, having very little circulating ca&s;h among them, had no means of procuring nece&s;&s;aries from Europe but by the crops they annually made&mdash;hence aro&s;e a practice of obtaining goods upon credit un|til their crops were reaped, and as the articles taken up at any one time were generally &s;mall in value and quantity, being chiefly occa&s;ional &s;upplies for their families, it was never thought nece&s;&s;ary to procure evidence of the facts, the mo&s;t perfect and de&s;erved|ly well grounded confidence, was placed by the planter in the books of the merchant; but in pro|ce&s;s of time, as the inhabitants became much more numerous, debtors &s;ometimes di&s;puted the accounts, which threatened de&s;truction to that confidence which had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the merchants and the planter, and which was e&s;&s;ential to the con|venience of the inhabitants. This induced the le|gi&s;lature
<PB N="5" REF="034906_0004_0FFF932662F09480">
of Virginia in the year 1748 to pa&s;s the act intituled "An act pre&s;cribing the method of prov|ing book debts"&mdash;a copy of which act is laid before the board.</P>
<P>After the pa&s;&s;age of this law the cour&s;e of trade continued upon the ancient footing, the deci&s;ions of the courts were equitable, and the practice of the bar liberal&mdash;a mutual confidence exi&s;ted between the merchant and the planter, and in the public o|pinion few evidences were more re&s;pected than a merchant's books. From this temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion of the parties, and the &s;ecurity which the law and the practices of the country afforded the credit|or, &s;uits were &s;eldom brought unle&s;s the delay of payment was uncon&s;cionable or the debtor declining in his circum&s;tances, in which ca&s;es they were brought not to authenticate the debt, for that was con&s;idered as e&s;tabli&s;hed without, but merely to in|force payment of the money. The revolution and its con&s;equent regulations, came therefor on your memoriali&s;ts by &s;urprize; but even if it had been fore&s;een, it was not in their power to compel pay|ment after the twelfth day of April 1774, as the co&s;ts of &s;uit in Virginia were regulated by a tempora|ry law called the Fee Bill, which expired on that day and was not revived again until other impedi|ments hereafter to be mentioned began to exi&s;t. In this &s;ituation were things when a law was pa&s;&s;ed which obliged the creditors, their factors and agents to leave the country.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts further beg leave to &s;hew, that on the 4th day of October 1779, an act was pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="034906_0005_0FFF9329C4C10698">
in Virginia, intituled "An act for di&s;couraging ex|ten&s;ive credits, and repealing the act pre&s;cribing the method of proving book debts"&mdash;a copy of which is al&s;o before the board. By the operations of this act and the deci&s;ions under it, tho&s;e hopes which your memoriali&s;ts had entertained, that on a return of peace they would have been permitted to prove their debts according to the exi&s;ting mode at the time they were contracted, were entirely bla&s;ted &mdash;for their books being no longer admitted as proof of the debt, and the factors, agents and &s;tore-keep|ers who might in &s;ome ca&s;es have proved them, be|ing driven out of the &s;tate, dead, or di&s;per&s;ed into different parts of the world, your memoriali&s;ts, in all ca&s;es of this de&s;cription are without redre&s;s in the courts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts having made the&s;e few prelim|inaries, and in their opinion nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations, beg leave further to &s;hew that prior to the fourth day of July 1776, they had e&s;tabli&s;hed (among o|thers) a &s;tore at  <GAP DESC="blank">  in Virginia under the care, &s;uperintendance and direction of Mr. Alexan|der Ho&s;burgh, which went by the name of their Brun&s;wick Store; and that at the time your memo|riali&s;ts &s;aid factor was obliged to leave Virginia there was ju&s;tly and bona fide due and owing to them from divers citizens of Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> the &s;um of thirteen hund|red and twenty-nine pounds thirteen &s;hillings and two pence three farthings Virginia currency, equal to  <GAP DESC="blank">  &s;terling money of Great Britain principal &s;um, a true and accurate &s;tatement of which with the names of the &s;everal debtors and
<PB N="7" REF="034906_0006_0FFF932B4778C3F8">
the dates, nature and amount of the &s;everal debts and the intere&s;t accrued thereon are annexed to this memorial on the &s;everal papers marked A, B, C, D, E, which your memoriali&s;ts pray, may be received taken and con&s;idered as part of this memorial and claim, and the &s;everal original notes, bills, orders and bonds, together with the accounts of the &s;aid &s;tore are ready to be produced before your board when and where you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to direct.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts further beg leave to &s;hew that each, every and all of the debts &s;tated on the &s;eve|ral papers marked as above, and forming part of this memorial, remained due and unpaid to your me|moriali&s;ts and their factor, at the time of their fac|tor's leaving Virginia in obedience and conformity to the law before mentioned, And that no part or parts of the &s;aid debts and demands, or any of them, have &s;ince been recovered or received by your Me|moriali&s;ts, or by any other per&s;on or per&s;ons to their u&s;e, but that each, every and all of them, &s;till re|main due and unpaid.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts further beg leave to &s;hew, that from a &s;hort time after the definitive treaty of peace between Great-Britain and the United States, they have had an Agent in Virginia, and yet have, fully authorized and empowered to collect and give ac|quittances for the debts due to them, but all the en|deavors of their &s;aid Agents were without effect, owing as well to the Impediments before &s;tated as to others herein after mentioned. In fact your me|moriali&s;ts a&s;&s;ert, that notwith&s;tanding the provi&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="034906_0007_0FFF932DB5D6F968">
contained in the 4th article of the &s;aid treaty of peace, no judgment was or could be obtained in Virginia, at the &s;uit of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, for a debt due before the war, where a plea of Briti&s;h debts was put in and &s;upported, until after the commence|ment of the year 1793, which year the fir&s;t judg|ment was rendered, and the deci&s;ions in many of the di&s;tricts and county courts were not effected &s;ooner than between two and three years afterwards.</P>
<P>The legal impediments which exi&s;ted in Virginia &s;ince the peace, preventing the recovery of Briti&s;h Debts, are to be found in the following Acts of A&s;|&s;embly, in addition to tho&s;e abovementioned, copies of which, in the following order, are before the Board.</P>

<P>This act is more generally known by the name of the Depreciation Law, and operates as an impedi|ment in the following manner. The debts due to your Memoriali&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were contracted before any De|preciation was known, but in many in&s;tances the Bonds were not taken for the &s;aid debts until after the period at which this retro&s;pective law has fixed the commencement of the &s;cale of depreciation. The bonds are taken for current money of Virginia; and as the courts of law refu&s;e to admit parol proof to alter the purport of what is under &s;eal, the&s;e bonds are determined to have been taken for the money current at the date, and to be reduced accordingly.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts deem it unnece&s;&s;ary herein par|ticularly to &s;tate each and every Act of the Legi&s;la|ture of Virginia which created impediments to the recovery of their ju&s;t demands; they will only add, that when the A&s;&s;embly of that State on the 12th December 1787, pa&s;&s;ed

<PB N="10" REF="034906_0009_0FFF9334973C3248">
&s;hall, by his Proclamation, notify to this State that Great-Britain hath delivered up to the United States the po&s;ts therein now occu|pied by Briti&s;h troops, which po&s;ts were &s;tipu|lated to be given up to Congre&s;s immediately after the conclu&s;ion of peace, and is al&s;o taking mea&s;ures for the further fulfilments of the &s;aid treaty by delivering up the negroes belonging to the citizens of this State, taken away contra|ry to the &s;eventh article of the treaty, or by making &s;uch compen&s;ation for them as &s;hall be &s;atisfactory to Congre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts further &s;hew, that by means of the impediments afore&s;aid, no &s;uits whatever could be maintained for debts due before the peace, in Virginia, to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, until after the adop|tion of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the United States&mdash;That even &s;ince the adoption of the &s;aid Con&s;titution, no debt can be recovered where your Memoriali&s;ts Store Books are the only evidence to &s;upport the demand, and in many in&s;tances of pro|mi&s;&s;ory notes and &s;igned &s;ettlements acknowledging the balance, the Act of Limitations has barred re|covery.</P>
<P>That in &s;uits upon obligations under &s;eal, bearing intere&s;t, the juries in all ca&s;es deduct at lea&s;t eight years intere&s;t, in many ca&s;es they barely allow the principal, and in others allow intere&s;t only from the impetration of the writ&mdash;That during the continu|ance of the impediments afore&s;aid, many of your Memoriali&s;ts' debtors have ab&s;conded or become in|&s;olvent, and from tho&s;e yet reputed &s;olvent, and

who&s;e debts are evidenced by bonds or notes, your Memoriali&s;ts cannot now actually have and receive the full value thereof in the ordinary cour&s;e of judi|cial proceedings, as well owing to the deduction of intere&s;t as afore&s;aid as to this further impediment, to wit, that at the time the &s;aid debts were &s;everally contracted the difference between &s;terling money of Great-Britain and the currency of Virginia was only 25 per cent, whereas by laws pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince, there is now a difference of 331/3; per cent.&mdash;</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts therefore pray that this their claim may be received to the amount of the &s;everal &s;ums of money principal and intere&s;t &s;tated in the &s;everal &s;chedules annexed to and forming part of this memorial, in which they have arranged the &s;e|veral debtors to their Brun&s;wick &s;tore, under the following cla&s;&s;es.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>THE ANSWER. <HI>TO THE COMMISSIONERS</HI> For carrying into effect the Sixth Article of the Trea|ty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, be|tween His Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States of America, concluded on the Nineteenth of November, 1794.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The an&s;wer of the United States by their agent to the claim of William Cunningham, Peter Murdoch, James Robi&s;on and John Hamilton, junior, &s;urviv|ing partners of Andrew Cochran, William Cunning|ham, Robert Bogle, John Murdoch, Peter Mur|doch, James Robi&s;on, William Hender&s;on, William Reid and John Hamilton, junior.</HEAD>
<P>SECTION I. AS this claim is conceived to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the board of commi&s;&s;ioners many of the important principles relative to the debts within the &s;tate of Virginia, of which payment may be claimed under the treaty of 1794 from the trea&s;ury of the United States, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be di&s;tinctly and thoroughly examined in all its parts, and that every material principle which it involves &s;hould be fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="034906_0016_0FFF93447B115680"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Limited juri&s;|diction of the Arbitrators.</NOTE>The United States and his Britannic Maje&s;ty have con&s;tituted by mutual con&s;ent an extraordinary tri|bunal for hearing and deciding the &s;pecial ca&s;es con|tained in the 6th article of the treaty of 1794. As the cognizance of this tribunal is expre&s;sly limited to &s;pecial ca&s;es, nothing can be more indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite than to under&s;tand the limits which are &s;et to it. In arbitraments between man and man under the municipal regulations of a &s;tate, it is a rule that the arbitrators ought not to exceed their juri&s;diction, and if they do, a remedy may be ea&s;ily &s;upplied in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, for by the civil as well as the common law an award upon a ca&s;e to which the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion does not extend is void. In arbitra|ments between nation and nation the &s;ame rule pre|vails that the arbitrators ought not to exceed their juri&s;diction, but if they do, there being no common controuling power to correct the error each nation has a ju&s;t right to judge for it&s;elf, and may ju&s;tly con&s;ider as void every arbitrament upon a ca&s;e out of their limited juri&s;diction. This ob&s;ervation is made to impre&s;s on the commi&s;&s;ioners the pri|mary importance of under&s;tanding the limits which are pre&s;cribed to them by the terms of the article: For &s;hould an error unfortunately occur on this point it may lay a foundation for di&s;appointing all the good con&s;equences that have been expected from the article and perhaps for renewing the di&s;&s;en|&s;ions between the two nations which it is &s;o de&s;ira|ble &s;hould be forever compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In expre&s;&s;ing on the part of the United States their opinion, that it is nece&s;&s;arily re&s;erved to each

nation to determine for it&s;elf whether an award is within the &s;phere of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limited juri&s;|diction of the Arbitrators.</NOTE> it is not meant to a&s;&s;ert that the arbitrators are not to decide for them&s;elves whether a ca&s;e is cognizable before them or not, but it is meant to a&s;&s;ert <HI>that though they &s;hall decide a ca&s;e to be cognizable before them, yet if it ap|pears to either nation that it is not, either has a ju&s;t right to di&s;regard the award.</HI> If this were not &s;o, there would be no difference between a limited and an un|limited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. If this were not &s;o, the commi&s;|&s;ioners might determine any and every que&s;tion upon any and every &s;ubject which concern the two nations. Though this opinion is &s;o rea&s;onable in it&s;elf that it need not be &s;upported by any authority, yet what a learned modern writer has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject de&s;erves to be noticed. Vattel relative to the arbi|tration of national di&s;putes ob&s;erves
<Q>It may then happen, as in the example ju&s;t alledged, that the arbitrators may exceed their power, and pa&s;s their judgment on what has not been really &s;ubmit|ted to their deci&s;ion: and being called to judge of the &s;atisfaction a &s;tate ought to make for an offence they may condemn it to become &s;ubject to the offen|ded. Certainly that &s;tate never gave them &s;o exten|&s;ive a power, and their ab&s;urd &s;entence is not bind|ing. To avoid all difficulty, and to take away every pretence from bad faith, it is nece&s;&s;ary to determine <HI>exactly in the compromi&s;e, the &s;ubject of the di&s;|pute, the re&s;pective and oppo&s;ite preten&s;ion, the demands of the one, and the oppo&s;itions of the other.</HI> This is what is &s;ubmitted to arbitrators, and upon this they promi&s;e to adhere to their judgment.
<PB N="4" REF="034906_0018_0FFF934A74C62D78">
If then their &s;entence is confined within the&s;e bounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limited juri&s;|diction of the Arbitrators.</NOTE> it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to it. It cannot be &s;aid that it is manife&s;tly unju&s;t, &s;ince it is pro|nounced on a que&s;tion which the di&s;&s;ention of the parties renders doubtful, <HI>and which has been &s;ubmit|ted as &s;uch.</HI> In order to be free from <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;entence, it &s;hould be proved by indubitable facts, that it was produced by corruption, or a flagrant partial|ity.</Q>

<P>Hence it appears if a ca&s;e within the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is de|cided by arbitrators, even though the &s;entence is con|ceived to be unju&s;t it ought to be executed unle&s;s proceeding from corruption; but if the ca&s;e be out of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion then the &s;entence is not obligatory.</P>
<P>When the treaty of 1794 was formed, the courts of ju&s;tice in all the &s;tates of America were open. This was well known to the negociators on both &s;ides as well as to both nations. But there were &s;ome par|ticular and extraordinary ca&s;es in which complete ju&s;tice was not attainab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice and to decide the&s;e a particular and extraor|dinary tribunal was in&s;tituted. The treaty having been made between two nations who &s;peak the &s;ame language, who are alike in manners and morals, who till lately were united under the &s;ame empire and who&s;e principles and ideas of ju&s;tice are deri|ved from the &s;ame &s;ources, it may be hoped to re|ceive the &s;ame interpretation in both countries, and e&s;pecially that there will be no di&s;agreement re&s;pect|ing the meaning of the 6th article among the com|mi&s;&s;ioners who are &s;elected to decide upon it.

the propo&s;ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion much aid will be &s;ought by the agent for the United States from the rules and principles of equity recognized by the judicial de|terminations of the Briti&s;h courts, who&s;e pure and wi&s;e admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice for many ages while it has been the &s;ource of happine&s;s to the people of that country, has al&s;o been an object of the high|e&s;t admiration among mankind.</P>
<P>It is a general rule that has prevailed at all times and which is acknowledged in all courts that the plaintiff or claimant mu&s;t produce &s;ufficient proofs of his ca&s;e to be entitled to the redre&s;s he &s;eeks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claimant to prove his Ca&s;e.</NOTE> <HI>Melior e&s;t conditio defendentis</HI> is a maxim highly e&s;|teemed becau&s;e it conduces to the &s;ecurity of pro|perty and to the repo&s;e of &s;ociety.

<P>So brief and intelligible is this &s;tipulation that it is difficult by any phra&s;eology to make it either more conci&s;e or plain. To attempt it let it be &s;aid that every claim again&s;t the United States mu&s;t be found|ed on a debt contracted before the peace and remain|ing due to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject on the 19th November 1794, from a citizen or inhabitant of the United States, which by the operation of &s;ome lawful im|pediment &s;ince the peace, has been either delayed as to recovery or le&s;&s;ened in value or &s;ecurity, &s;o that a lo&s;s and damage has accrued to the creditor for which in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings <HI>full</HI> compen&s;ation cannot be obtained and which lo&s;s and damage was not occa&s;ioned by the in&s;olvency of the debtor or any other cau&s;e that would have equally produced it, if a legal impediment had not exi&s;ted, or by the manife&s;t delay or negligence or wilful omi&s;&s;ion of the claimant. For every &s;uch lo&s;s and damage, full and adequate compen&s;ation is pro|mi&s;ed by the United States, and God forbid that a promi&s;e &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o honorable &s;hould not be ful|filled with exemplary fidelity.</P>

had exi&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The claimant to prove his ca&s;e.</NOTE> it is not to be compen&s;ated by the United States.</P>
<P>Nothing need be &s;aid to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of proving the fir&s;t, &s;econd and fourth particular nor to elucidate the rea&s;onablene&s;s of requiring that proof from the claimant. A few remarks however are expedient relative to the third and fifth.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e it may be ob&s;erved the claimant is to be pre&s;umed to know the circum&s;tances of the debt|or, becau&s;e they are generally known when the credit is given, and the creditor having an intere&s;t in the affairs of his debtor, will naturally from time to time make enquiries concerning his tran&s;actions, &s;o as to know how he has been employed, whether he has been thrifty or prodigal, what e&s;tate he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, what was done with it, where his domicil is, and many other particulars which need not be here enu|merated. If the agents of the United States were multiplied &s;o as to fill every corner of the country this &s;ort of knowledge would be acquired by them in mo&s;t in&s;tances with great difficulty and expen&s;e. This ob&s;ervation is &s;pecially applicable to claims ari|&s;ing out of debts contracted in America in the cour&s;e of retail dealing. Therefore it &s;eems on this account rea&s;onable that the claimant &s;hould be required to prove the &s;olvency of the debtor at the treaty of peace, and his in&s;olvency &s;ince, and the legal im|pediment to the recovery of the debt which has oc|ca&s;ioned a lo&s;s. But another rea&s;on for requiring the&s;e proofs from the claimant ari&s;es from the na|ture of the promi&s;e of the United States. It is a promi&s;e to pay out of their trea&s;ury whatever &s;um
<PB N="10" REF="034906_0024_0FFF935978874C58">
of money is nece&s;&s;ary in certain ca&s;es for doing com|plete ju&s;tice to the creditor which the debtor ought to pay, but which cannot be got from him. They are re&s;pon&s;ible to pay, only if the debtor cannot ei|ther by rea&s;on of inability or certain other cau|&s;es be compelled to make full compen&s;ation, and have agreed to pay whatever deficiency of full com|pen&s;ation &s;hall remain unattainable from the debtor in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings in the particular ca&s;eS de&s;cribed in the article. The claim|ant therefore ought to prove what this deficiency is, which implies that he mu&s;t al&s;o prove that he has diligently pro&s;ecuted all rea&s;onable means for recov|ering from the debtor whatever it was po&s;&s;ible to get from him in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. In the ca&s;e of every particular <HI>debtor</HI> a que&s;tion will a|ri&s;e to be decided by the commi&s;&s;ioners, whether the creditor has u&s;ed rea&s;onable diligence to compel him to pay the debt. Hence it may be inferred as a <HI>general</HI> rule that the creditor ought to apply to the courts of ju&s;tice again&s;t the debtor before he applies to the commi&s;&s;ioners again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;es not re|lievable under the treaty.</NOTE>If this interpretation of the meaning of the &s;tipu|lation be correct, it will follow that compen&s;ation ought not to be awarded again&s;t the United States for a lo&s;s and damage in any of the following ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Where a debtor has re&s;ided in a &s;tate, in which ever &s;ince the peace the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice has been as free and unimpeded in re&s;pect to Briti&s;h cre|ditors as it was before the war.</P>

That cannot be &s;aid to be a lo&s;s and damage, to which the party freely <HI>con&s;ents.</HI></P>

<P N="9">9th. Nor where the treaty of peace having com|plete operation, the ju&s;tice and extent of the claim has been judicially decided and a&s;certained accord|ing to tho&s;e rules of law and equity which prevailed when the contract was made and the judgment of the court has been fully &s;atisfied and di&s;charged. For in&s;tance, where verdicts founded on equity have been rendered for the defendant, or where in judicial proceedings off-&s;ets and credits have been ju&s;tly al|lowed to reduce the debt, or where intere&s;t during the war in whole or in part has been di&s;allowed upon equitable con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>It is not attempted to enumerate here all the ca&s;es which may be brought forward, containing &s;ome feature or other that excludes them from relief under the 6th article of the treaty, but tho&s;e are pre&s;ent|ed to view which &s;eem lea&s;t liable to controver&s;y. This article mu&s;t be admitted to have grown out of the 4th article of the treaty of peace, and was meant to retribute the lo&s;&s;es and damages in certain ca&s;es ari&s;ing from a contravention or imperfect execution of it. If this be the policy of the &s;tipulation, it may be laid down as a fundamental rule, that no lo&s;s nor damage is reparable under the treaty of 1794 that is not grounded on a debt comprehended in the 4th article of the treaty of 1783 and has not pro|ceeded from the violation or non execution thereof. This leads to an enquiry as to the true meaning of the la&s;tmentioned article and particularly whether it meant to provide for the payment of intere&s;t during
<PB N="13" REF="034906_0027_0FFF9364C77B9E70">
the war, and if it did not, then it mu&s;t be contended that compen&s;ation ought not to be awarded for in|tere&s;t during the war.</P>
<P>SEC. 4.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> The&s;e debts were contracted either in the then American colonies where the creditor and deb|tor re&s;ided at the time of contract, or el&s;ewhere in other parts of the Briti&s;h dominions where the cre|ditor re&s;ided. Mo&s;t of the objections again&s;t the claim of war-intere&s;t, are alike applicable to both de&s;criptions of debt and a few will apply with grea|ter force to the former.</P>
<P>Though the 4th article of the treaty of peace, is in its terms reciprocal &s;o that it would &s;eem that each nation was equally intere&s;ted in having it plain and free from doubt, yet the contrary is well known to be the fact. The creditors almo&s;t entirely belong|ed to one and the debtors to the other nation. It was then the peculiar intere&s;t and duty of the credi|tor nation to expre&s;s this &s;tipulation in &s;uch language as to leave no doubt that it embraced not only the principal debt but the intere&s;t al&s;o during the war, and if this explanation has not been made it is the wor&s;e for that nation. <HI>Veteribus placet pactionem ob|&s;curam vel ambiguam venditori et qui locavit nocere; in quorum fuit pote&s;tate legem apertius con&s;cribere.

"It is an ancient rule that an ob&s;cure or ambiguous pact is to be con|&s;trued unfavorably to the vender and creditor in who&s;e power it was to expre&s;s the legal meaning more plainly." The &s;ame thing is laid down by Vat|tel as a general maxim in interpreting treaties B. 2. Section 264. "If he who can and ought to have ex|plained

The pact made between the two nations exi&s;ts only in the article now under con&s;ideration, and if the expre&s;&s;ions admit a rea&s;o|nable doubt whether intere&s;t during the war was comprehended or not, and if it was the duty of the creditor to have been more explicit than he has been, that interpretation is to be received according to the&s;e rules, which is mo&s;t favorable to the debtor.</P>
<P>This argument is enforced by what pa&s;&s;ed between the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States for negotiat|ing a peace with Great-Britain, and David Hartley, mini&s;ter of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. Before the defi|nitive treaty was &s;igned in their letter of the 17th July 1783, they repre&s;ented the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s on war-intere&s;t, in the following words "Congre&s;s al&s;o think it rea&s;onable that &s;uch part of the intere&s;t which may have accrued on &s;uch debts during the war &s;hall not be payable, becau&s;e all intercour&s;e be|tween the two countries had, during that period be|come impracticable, as well as improper. It does not appear ju&s;t that individuals in America &s;hould pay for delays in payment, which were occa&s;ioned by the civil and military mea&s;ures of Great-Bri|tain."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident's Me&s;&s;ages, page 140.</NOTE> After this if War-intere&s;t was meant to be claimed on the part of Great-Britain &s;ome un|eqivocal terms &s;hould have been u&s;ed, comprehend|ing it, and the not u&s;ing &s;uch terms is an acquie&s;cence

in the opinion entertained by Congre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> which had been communicated by the American negotiators of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Hence it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pre&s;umed that the article was under&s;tood by Great-Britain, as it was by America, and under&s;tood not to comprehend war-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is &s;aid by Grotius, that if the mean|ing of words be dubious as the &s;eller or buyer may be affected, the interpretation ought to be again&s;t the &s;eller, who ought to blame him&s;elf for not fully explaining him&s;elf. B. iii. Ch. 20. Sect. 26. So if a doubt ari&s;es whether the words of a &s;tipulation ought to be interpreted favorably to the creditor or to the debtor, the rea&s;on of this rule ought to be ap|plied in favor of the debtor, who is generally in the greater want, and therefore is in more need of the benignity of con&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Suppo&s;ing the words of the article to be am|biguous, that interpretation is to be preferred that leads to equality, and therefore it has become a well known rule, that the cau&s;e of him who wi&s;hes to avoid a lo&s;s, is to be preferred to him who &s;eeks an advantage. Vattel, book 2d. &s;ection 301. To deny intere&s;t on the&s;e debts during the war will put the creditor and debtor upon a more equal footing than to exact it, and a lo&s;s will not be incurred by the debtor for the &s;ake of a gain to the creditor.</P>
<P>What is meant by intere&s;t?</P>
<P>If intere&s;t be defined the hire of money to be paid by another for the u&s;e of it, this ought not to be paid to the creditor, when the debtor has been de|prived
<PB N="16" REF="034906_0030_0FFF936C1CAC1A68">
of the means of u&s;ing it with profit by unfore|&s;een events,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> to be attributed to the creditor equally, if not more than to him&s;elf. If the creditor receive intere&s;t during the war, he lo&s;es nothing, and gains every thing that he would have gained in peace. To him the war is no calamity. On the other hand if the debtor pays intere&s;t during the war, hav|ing made no profit during this period, but in many in&s;tances having &s;u&s;tained lo&s;&s;es, he will be charged with an additional lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus then it is apparent, that if the Briti&s;h cre|ditors remain without war-intere&s;t from their Ame|rican debtors, who made no profits during the war, the two parties will be in a more equal &s;ituation, than if the former &s;hould receive that intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The &s;tipulation in the fourth article of the treaty of peace "that creditors on either &s;ide &s;hall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money of all bona fide debts" contracted before that time, provides for the principal only, and leaves all claims of intere&s;t open, to be decided judicially, according to all the circum|&s;tances of each ca&s;e. There is no country in the world, where the di&s;tinction between principal and intere&s;t is better under&s;tood than in Great-Britain, and there <HI>Debt</HI> in common parlance means principal exclu&s;ively of intere&s;t. Generally in accounts the debt and the intere&s;t are di&s;tinctly &s;tated.</P>
<P>If in the language of &s;ome political writers inte|re&s;t is truly defined to be the <HI>hire of money,</HI> it cannot be contended that the hire of the &s;um is the &s;ame thing with the &s;um it&s;elf. This would be to &s;ay that
<PB N="17" REF="034906_0031_0FFF936D9EB6F210">
a profit produced by a thing, was the thing it&s;elf.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> But the profit of land, or chattels is well known to be a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate thing from the land or chattels. No remark perhaps can more &s;trongly en|force this di&s;tinction between debt and intere&s;t, than that debts in many in&s;tances do not carry intere&s;t. This is too well known to require particular illu&s;tra|tion. If a &s;um of money be due, a promi&s;e to pay the debt is not a promi&s;e that intere&s;t on the debt &s;hall be paid al&s;o.</P>
<P>According to the Roman lawyers "intere&s;t is what is given more than the principal, that the creditor may not be a lo&s;er;" U&s;ura quod accedit ne in dam|no ver&s;etur creditor. Grotius B. 2. chap. 12. note to &s;ec. 21. The learned Puffendorf ob&s;erves that the damages allowed the creditor for what he might have made of his money, are among other rea&s;ons, de|manded for failure of payment at the time appoint|ed, which ought to be &s;tated according to the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained, be it what it will; but becau&s;e it would be difficult to prove and adju&s;t it exactly, it is there|fore generally reduced to regular intere&s;t."</P>
<P>"Since therefore 'tis lawful to demand damages for tardy payment, or becau&s;e we lo&s;e by not having our money paid in at the time appointed, why may we not bargain for &s;omething certain be|fore hand, upon con&s;ideration that our money is in another man's power, whereas we were not obliged for his benefit to venture the lo&s;s, or to neglect the gain that might be made of it." B. 5. chap. 7. &s;ec. 9. But on this point let the books of Engli&s;h juri&s;pru|dence be con&s;ulted, and let that definition of intere&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="034906_0032_0FFF9372137F1AA8">
be received in preference to any other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> which in a long cour&s;e of judicial deci&s;ions, by learned, wi&s;e and ju&s;t judges, has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. To this the claimant will not pre&s;ume to object, and the agent for the United States con&s;cious of the inte|grity, intelligence and equity, which the judges of that country have di&s;played, mo&s;t readily con&s;ents. By the Engli&s;h judges, intere&s;t is con&s;idered as com|pen&s;ation for the damage ari&s;ing from detaining the debt, and &s;o di&s;tinct is the intere&s;t con&s;idered from the debt, that an action of debt does not lie to reco|ver the intere&s;t accrued on the debt. In the ca&s;e of Yeoman vs. Bar&s;tow, ju&s;tice Powel &s;aid that "debt ne gi&s;t pour interet," 1 Lutwyche 274. In the ca&s;e of Seaman vs. Dee, after &s;everal arguments lord chief ju&s;tice Hale &s;aid "no action of debt lies for the inte|re&s;t of money, though he which borrows it, promi|&s;es to pay after the rate of 6 per cent for it, but it is to be recovered by a&s;&s;ump&s;it in damages. So where by deed the party covenants or binds him&s;elf to pay the principal with intere&s;t, the intere&s;t is not to be included with the principal, in an action of debt, but &s;hall be turned into damages, which the jury is to mea&s;ure to what the intere&s;t amounts to." 1 Ven|tri&s;s 198. This is a judicial re&s;olution upon the very point, whether intere&s;t was recoverable as debt, which was brought before the court by demurrer, and therefore is of high authority. If it be an axiom of Engli&s;h law, as it is believed to be that an <HI>action of debt</HI> lies for recovering every debt, and if &s;uch an action does not lie for intere&s;t, as has been &s;hewn, it then follows that in the eye of Engli&s;h law, inte|re&s;t is not debt.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="034906_0033_0FFF93739525BDF8">In the ca&s;e of Holdiph vs. Otway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> it was declared by the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be the cour&s;e of both courts upon a judgment in debt by default or confe&s;&s;ion to tax the damages occa&s;ione detentionis debiti as well as the co&s;ts of &s;uit &amp;c. 2d.

Mod. 277. Lord Mansfield in the ca&s;e of Zinck vs. Langton, confirmed this doctrine that in an action for debt intere&s;t is recoverable by the way of damage and ought to be the rule for a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the damage. This was a writ of error, and a motion was made under the &s;tatute of Henry the 7th. that intere&s;t on the original judgement &s;hould be allowed for da|mage &s;u&s;tained by the delay ari&s;ing from the writ of error which was granted by the court, who &s;aid that the original action being for a debt, the intere&s;t ought to be the mea&s;ure of the damage." So in Sweatland vs. Squire, ju&s;tice Powel &s;aid that intere&s;t is recovered by way of damages when damages are recovered occa&s;ione detentionis debiti. 2d. Salkeld 623.

intere&s;t is recoverable as compen&s;ation for the da|mage occa&s;ioned by detaining the debt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> Thus much has been thought nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the po&s;i|tion, that "debt" is di&s;tingui&s;hable from intere&s;t and does not nece&s;&s;arily ex vi termini include inte|re&s;t. If this be admitted, then the 4th article of the treaty of peace being &s;ilent as to intere&s;t, may be interpreted not to include it, but to leave all claims of intere&s;t to be decided according to ju&s;tice, upon a comprehen&s;ive view of all circum&s;tances attending each ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As a general rule it may be admitted that intere&s;t from the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace ought to be paid to the creditor in &s;pecialty ca&s;es, and al&s;o wherever by the u&s;age of trade it was in contemplation of both parties that it &s;hould be pay|able. Though this &s;hould be admitted, yet it is contended that intere&s;t during the war under the &s;ingular and unprecedented circum&s;tances under which the creditor and the debtor were placed by it, ought not in equity to be paid.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e it may fairly be inferred that the omi&s;&s;ion in the treaty to &s;tipulate for the payment of war-intere&s;t, was meant to bury in oblivion that &s;pecies of damage ari&s;ing from the detention of debt for which intere&s;t is the ordinary compen&s;ation. This idea is &s;trongly &s;upported by Vattel, who &s;ays,
<Q>As every power at war pretends to have right on its &s;ide, and this preten&s;ion is not liable to be judg|ed by others, the &s;tate of things at the in&s;tant of the treaty is to be held legitimate, and any change to be made in it requires an expre&s;s &s;pecification

in the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> con&s;equently all things not mention|ed in the treaty, are to remain as they were at the conclu&s;ion of it. This is al&s;o a con&s;equence of the promi&s;ed amne&s;ty. All the damages cau&s;ed during the war are likewi&s;e buried in oblivion, and no plea is allowable for tho&s;e the re&s;toration of which is not mentioned in the treaty: they are looked on as if they had never happened.</Q>
B. iv, &s;ec. 21. If then the damage to the creditor by detain|ing his debt during the war, is to be buried in obli|vion, there remains no ground to claim compen&s;a|tion for that damage, or in other words to claim in|tere&s;t. This matter mu&s;t remain incapable of repa|ration as at the in&s;tant of the treaty.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In a liberal view of this &s;ubject it de&s;erves to be noticed that different opinions have been en|tertained in the United States and great Britain con|cerning that part of the 7th Article which prohibits the "carrying away negroes or other property of the American in habitants," and it has been executed in the manner mo&s;t favorable to the latter. The Ame|ricans in&s;i&s;ted that this Article was to be interpreted <HI>liberally</HI> in favor of their ancient rights, but the <HI>strict</HI> con&s;truction has prevailed. With re&s;pect to the 4th Article concerning debts, the Americans have con|tended and do contend, that a &s;trict con&s;truction ought to be given to it, excluding intere&s;t, but on the part of Britain it is urged that a liberal con&s;truc|tion &s;hould be given, &s;o as to include intere&s;t. Is it rea&s;onable or equal that where a &s;trict interpreta|tion of one article will be advantageous to Britain, it &s;hould be taken, and that where a &s;trict interpreta|ion
<PB N="22" REF="034906_0036_0FFF93792C9CBEF0">
of another article will be advantageous to Ame|rica,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> it &s;hould be denied. In a national point of view, may not the lo&s;s of &s;laves by rea&s;on of the &s;trict con&s;truction put on one article, be rea&s;onably oppo&s;ed to the demand of intere&s;t during the war, when founded not on a &s;trict but on the mo&s;t liberal interpretation of another article? Is it rea&s;onable that every article in the treaty &s;hall be under&s;tood mo&s;t unfavorably to the United States? Is it con&s;i&s;t|ent with tho&s;e "principles of liberal equity and re|ciprocity" which the preliminary articles declare to be the ba&s;is for &s;ecuring perpetual peace and harmo|ny?</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It cannot be &s;aid with rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, that when by the laws of the nation to whom the credi|tor was &s;ubject, it was highly criminal for him to receive payment, the damage to him in not re|ceiving payment, &s;hould be an&s;wered by the debt|or. So fully impre&s;&s;ed with the weight of this argu|ment was the Briti&s;h Secretary of Foreign Affairs, in the year 1786, in a conver&s;ation with the Ameri|can Mini&s;ter, that he agreed with him in the inju&s;|tice of demanding intere&s;t during that period. This may be &s;een in an extract of a letter from the Ame|rican Mini&s;ter at the Court of Great-Britain to the American Secretary for Foreign Affairs, dated June 16, 1786.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="034906_0037_0FFF937D7A93F4D8">
of giving up the intere&s;t during the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> and of agreeing to a plan of payment by in&s;talments, was again in&s;i&s;ted on, from various con&s;iderations, particularly from the evident inju&s;tice of demand|ing intere&s;t from that period. It was urged that the claim of intere&s;t, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, was grounded upon cu&s;tom and the mutual under&s;tanding of the parties; but that it never had been the cu&s;tom, nor had it ever been under&s;tood or fore&s;een that an Act of Parliament &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, ca&s;ting the American debtor out of the protection of the crown, cutting off all corre&s;pondence and render|ing all intercour&s;e criminal; for that was the re|&s;ult and the legal con&s;truction during the whole war.</Q>
<P><Q>Here his Lord&s;hip fully agreed with me, and ev|en out-went me, &s;aying, that "It was very true, that by con&s;truction of the law of this land, it was high trea&s;on in a creditor in Great-Britain to re|ceive a remittance from his debtor in America du|ring the war." His Lord&s;hip added &s;ome &s;light expre&s;&s;ions concerning the intere&s;t, and wi&s;hed that the Courts were opened for recovering the principal: we might leave the intere&s;t for an after con&s;ideration.</Q> <BIBL>Pre&s;ident's Me&s;&s;ages, 140.</BIBL></P>
<P N="4">4thly. The detention of the debt during the war, was unavoidable by rea&s;on of the war, not only be|cau&s;e all commerce was interdicted to the United States by the Briti&s;h parliament, and all intercour&s;e and acce&s;s between the American debtors and Briti&s;h creditors was unlawful and generally impo&s;&s;ible in con&s;equence of the party creditor, but becau&s;e the
<PB N="24" REF="034906_0038_0FFF9380DAB8AED8">
Americans were ab&s;olutely deprived of the means of payment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> by the nature, manner and events of the war. On the &s;ide of the Americans it was a war for life, liberty and property&mdash;it was a war pro aris et focis; their country was invaded almo&s;t every where, ho&s;tilities were brought into its bo&s;om, their great towns taken, &s;ome of their &s;mall ones de&s;troy|ed, the hu&s;bandmen obliged to abandon their homes, the labourers carried away by force, or &s;educed by reward, the plantations and farms not permitted to be cultivated, as in ordinary wars between independent nations they might have been, and all the products of the land were indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for defence. There was nothing left to an individual for paying intere&s;t on his debt, and in a conte&s;t of this kind, if &s;ucce&s;sful, few expected to be required at a future day to pay intere&s;t upon <HI>any debt</HI> due to a Briti&s;h creditor, for that &s;pace of time when all profit from their property was become impo&s;&s;ible. Waving the enquiry before a tribunal con&s;tituted as this is, con|cerning the ju&s;tice of the war on the one &s;ide or on the other, it may be a&s;&s;erted, that if the two nati|ons had equal ju&s;tice on its &s;ide in regard to it, yet under the extraordinary circum&s;tances attending its pro&s;ecution it is not equitable to claim intere&s;t dur|ing the period of the war upon American debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The agent for the United States is aware that Great-Britain is to be viewed in the light of a creditor nation in Europe, A&s;ia and Ame|rica, and that it deeply concerns her to extend the claims of intere&s;t upon debts as far as may be prac|ticable, yet he relies they will be limited by the principles of equity.

<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that at the time this author
<PB N="26" REF="034906_0040_0FFF9384F2DC6E78">
wrote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> intere&s;t was lawful in but few countries, and there not generally but in &s;pecial ca&s;es: therefore intere&s;t on a debt during war could not have been in his contemplation, and the latter &s;ection is to be confined to the principal only. So under&s;tand|ing it the doctrine is not denied. But the former &s;ection very much favors the idea which has been be|fore pre&s;&s;ed, that intere&s;t being the rated damage for detaining the principal, and this detention being the effect of the war, and the treaty not expre&s;sly mentioning intere&s;t, it ought to be con&s;idered as a damage forgiven by the peace.</P>
<P>In like manner it is laid down by Vattel
<Q>debts contracted with individuals or injuries which they may have received without relating to the war, are likewi&s;e not aboli&s;hed by the agreement and amne&s;ty, the&s;e relating only to their object, that is <HI>the war, its cau&s;es and effects.</HI></Q>
<Q>That the ef|fect of the agreement or amne&s;ty cannot be ex|tended to things of no relation to the war, con|cluded by the treaty. Thus claims founded on a debt or an injury prior to the war, but which made a part of the rea&s;ons for undertaking it remain en|tire, and are not aboli&s;hed by the treaty unle&s;s it be formally extended to the extinction of every claim whatever. It is the &s;ame with debts con|tracted during the war but for cau&s;es of no rela|tion to it or with injuries likewi&s;e done during the cour&s;e of the war, but foreign to the &s;tate of it.</Q>
Upon this let it be ob&s;erved that the fir&s;t clau&s;e relates to the debts due to the nation, and the latter to the debts due to individuals; and it is agreed that

neither &s;pecies of debts as di&s;tinct from intere&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intere&s;t during the War.</NOTE> are aboli&s;hed by a treaty of peace without expre&s;s words to that effect. 2d. It is true that the author lived at a time when intere&s;t on debts was become more ge|neral than in the time of Grotius, and therefore per|haps he has u&s;ed different expre&s;&s;ions, which as to individuals are confined to <HI>debts</HI> exclu&s;ive of intere&s;t, or if they extend to intere&s;t during the war, they are to be under&s;tood to aboli&s;h intere&s;t during this period. According to him claims for re|paration of injuries ari&s;ing from or effected by the war, are aboli&s;hed; others not relating to the war are not. Tne detention of the debt during the war was an injury or damage to the creditor, pro|duced by the war, e&s;pecially under the circum&s;tances of the American war; therefore a claim for repara|tion for this damage, that is for intere&s;t during the war is aboli&s;hed by the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>But further to illu&s;trate that the circum&s;tances of the American war ought in the judgment of ju&s;t men to exempt the debtor from paying intere&s;t during that period, it de&s;erves to be noticed that in the un|der&s;tanding of both parties when the credit was giv|en, the expected profits of the farms and plantations in America con&s;tituted the funds from which the debts were payable, and the intere&s;t too in tho&s;e ca|&s;es where by contract or u&s;age intere&s;t ought to be paid. It is laid down by Viner in his abridgement of the laws of England
<Q>that where by a general and <HI>national</HI> calamity nothing is made out of lands which are a&s;&s;igned for the payment of in|tere&s;t, it ought not to run on during the time of &s;uch calamity.</Q>

<Q>Can a more general nati|onal calamity be conceived than that univer&s;al de|va&s;tion, which took place in many of tho&s;e &s;tates during the war?

The pro|duce of tho&s;e lands, for want of the opportunity of exporting it &s;afely, was down to almo&s;t no|thing in real money, e. g. tobacco was le&s;s than a dollar the 100lb. Imported articles of cloathing or com&s;umption were from four to eight times their u&s;ual price. A bu&s;hel of &s;alt was u&s;ually &s;old for 100lb. of tobacco. At the &s;ame time, the&s;e lands, and other property, in which the money of the Briti&s;h creditor was ve&s;ted, were paying high taxes for their own protection, and the debtor as nomi|nal holder, &s;tood ultimate in&s;urer of their value to the creditor, who was the real proprietor, be|cau&s;e they were bought with his money. And who will e&s;timate the value of this in&s;urance, or &s;ay what would have been the forfeit in a contrary event of the war? Who will &s;ay that the ri&s;k of the property was not worth the intere&s;t of its price.</Q>

A con|currence of opinion on this point in the different &s;tates, of the numerous individuals who&s;e duty in &s;ome way or other it has been to decide upon it, &s;peaks loudly in favor of its rectitude; e&s;pecially when it is remem|bered that in &s;ome of the &s;tates, the claims of Briti&s;h debts were &s;o incon&s;iderable, and &s;o few as not to have occa&s;ioned public concern, or to have excited any prejudices.

The Agent for the United States is authoriz|ed to repre&s;ent that this was the prevailing practice in Maryland and Virginia; and to add, that demands for more than a million of dollars have been &s;ettled and paid in tho&s;e two &s;tates according to this rule, with the con&s;ent of the creditors, and in mo&s;t in|&s;tances at their own &s;ugge&s;tion.

<P>Whether intere&s;t during the war, ought in equity to be paid, was a que&s;tion more likely to be decided rightly immediately upon the return of the peace, when all the circum&s;tances of the war were in the knowledge of the parties, than at a later period; and the general impre&s;&s;ion, the general conviction and general practice which was then taken up by the cre|ditors, that intere&s;t during the war ought not to be claimed furni&s;hes an argument that de&s;erves much con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons that have occured for main|taining the propo&s;ition that the Briti&s;h creditors are not entitled upon principles of ju&s;tice to intere&s;t dur|ing the war, on the debts due from the American debtors, which were contracted before the war, whe|ther the debts be evidenced by bond, note or account. A bond in common form carries intere&s;t only by the u&s;age of the courts and juries in America as well as

<P>If according to the treaty of peace the payment of intere&s;t during the war is not &s;tipulated but left to be decided by principles of equity, and if the&s;e princi|ples dictate that it ought not to be paid, then the claim of intere&s;t during the war cannot be awarded in any ca&s;e whatever, under the treaty of 1794. The 6th article of this treaty was not de&s;igned to enlarge the rights of creditors beyond what they were under the treaty of 1783, but to &s;atisfy their claims under the 4th article of that treaty, in in&s;tances where from the operation of legal impediments contrary to good faith lo&s;&s;es had occurred, and complete ju&s;|tice was unattainable from the debtors, and the cre|ditors had not been in fault.</P>

pre&s;ent claimants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No legal impe|diment in Vir|ginia &s;ince the peace.</NOTE> there is not a &s;ingle bond of this de&s;cription; for they are dated anterior to the fir&s;t day of January in the year 1777, and the &s;pace of depreciation fixed by the act commenced on the fir&s;t day of January 1777, and ended the 1&s;t day of Ja|nuary 1782. Con&s;equently the&s;e claimants have no right to complain of the depreciation law, as they have not received a lo&s;s from it in any ca&s;e, in any form whatever. It is re&s;erved to the United States more fully to di&s;cu&s;s this law, when any ca&s;e of lo&s;s under it &s;hall be pre&s;ented to the board. In the mean time the agent for the United States thinks proper to mention his information, that by judicial deci&s;ions it has been &s;ettled in Virginia, that if a bond dated at any time between the 1&s;t day of Ja|nuary 1777, and 1&s;t day of January 1782, contains in the condition or any part of it any thing to &s;hew the debt was originally contracted before the date of the bond, the depreciation law &s;hall not be con&s;trued to operate on &s;uch a ca&s;e; but if the bond has no &s;uch intrin&s;ic evidence of the time the debt was con|tracted, it is liable to be &s;caled and parole evidence is not admitted to alter the effect and purport of the &s;ealed in&s;trument. Thus then if the creditor omitted to take a bond &s;o as to &s;hew by &s;omething in it, that it was probably to &s;ecure a debt contracted before the war, it was a wilful omi&s;&s;ion in him, and if any lo&s;s ari&s;es from hence, it is a lo&s;s not intended by the treaty of 1794, to be charged on the United States.</P>

<Q>Whereas it is &s;tipulated by the fourth article of the treaty of peace between the king of Great-Britain and the United States of America in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, that creditors on either &s;ide &s;hall meet with no lawful impediment in the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted; Be it therefore enacted by the General A&s;&s;embly, that &s;uch of the acts or parts of acts of the legi&s;lature of this commonwealth, as have prevented or may prevent the recovery of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, according to the true intent and meaning of the &s;aid treaty of peace, &s;hall be, and are here|by repealed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Provided that this act &s;hall be &s;u&s;pended until the governor with the advice of council &s;hall, by his proclamation, notify to this &s;tate that Great-Britain hath delivered up to the United States the po&s;ts therein now occupied by Briti&s;h troops, which po&s;ts were &s;tipulated by treaty, to be given up to Congre&s;s immediately after the conclu&s;ion of peace; and is al&s;o taking mea&s;ures for the fur|ther fulfilment of the &s;aid treaty, by delivering up the negroes belonging to the citizens of this &s;tate taken away contrary to the &s;eventh article of the treaty, or by making &s;uch compen&s;ation for them as &s;hall be &s;atisfactory to Congre&s;s.</Q>
It will not be urged that this act repealed any act what&s;oever prohibiting the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, if any le|gal prohibition at that time exi&s;ted. But the whole act is to be con&s;idered as nugatory; the provi&s;o an|nexed to the act which is correctly &s;et forth by the

claimants &s;u&s;pended the operation of the act com|pletely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No legal impe|diment in Vir|ginia &s;ince the peace.</NOTE> if indeed there had been any &s;ubject for its operation. In reality there was no &s;uch &s;ubject. There was no act or part of an act in force which prohibited the recovery of Briti&s;h debts on the 12th of December 1787, and it was pa&s;&s;ed under an erro|neous opinion that &s;ome &s;uch act or part of an act did then exi&s;t: an opinion that was generally prevalent as much becau&s;e the creditors did not venture to bring forward their claims from an idea of a general prejudice again&s;t them before a court of ju&s;tice, as for any other rea&s;on which can be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It has been alledged as another impediment to the recovery of the full value of the debts in &s;terling money, in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceed|ings, that at the time the debts were &s;everally contract|ed the difference between &s;terling money of Great-Britain and currency of Virginia was only 25 per cent, and by the laws pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the revolution the difference is now 33&frac13; per cent. Since the year 1755 to this day, the law has been re&s;pecting the &s;ter|ling money debts, the &s;ame. It was enacted,
<Q>that in any action which hath been or &s;hall be com|menced, and is or &s;hall be depending for the reco|very of any <HI>&s;terling</HI> money in any court of record within this commonwealth, wherein the plaintiff or plaintiffs &s;hall recover; &s;uch court &s;hall have power, and are hereby directed by rule, to be en|tered at the foot of their judgment in &s;uch action, to order &s;uch judgment to be di&s;charged or levied in current money at &s;uch rate of exchange <HI>as they &s;hall think ju&s;t,</HI> any law, u&s;age or cu&s;tom to the

contrary notwith&s;tanding.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No legal impe|diment in Vir|ginia &s;ince the peace.</NOTE></Q>
Virginia laws 121,323. The&s;e are the very words of the act of a&s;&s;embly at this day in force, and con&s;equently there &s;eems no pretence for the complaint which has been made re|lative to debts contracted in &s;terling money. As to debts contracted in Virginia, in current money of Vir|ginia, there never was a law which fixed the value of current money of Virginia in &s;terling money of Great-Britain at any certain rate, nor was a debt in the current money of the &s;tate ever expected to be di&s;charged in &s;terling money: The lex loci was in theory and practice the rule, and when the current money debt was paid in &s;pecie at the current value, the debtor was di&s;charged in equity as well as law. The value of a Spani&s;h milled dollar varied from five &s;hillings and ninepence currency to &s;ix &s;hillings cur|rency, and was e&s;timated of the latter value about the time the revolution commenced. Since the re|volution the value of a dollar is fixed by law to be &s;ix &s;hillings, and other &s;ilver coins in proportion, and the dollar is the adopted item in account. Was it contemplated by the two nations when they made the treaties, that this was a &s;ubject on which a diffe|rence would ari&s;e? Rather was not the phra&s;e
<Q>va|lue in &s;terling money</Q>
in the treaty of peace intend|ed to preclude paper money in all varieties of form: Ought it not to be re&s;trained to paper money, and not extended to &s;pecie? e&s;pecially when the actual rate of &s;pecie in the dealings of individuals was the &s;ame on the 19th April 1775, or 4th July 1776, as at this day in Virginia.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the acts which the pre&s;ent claimants have &s;pecifically alledged to create impediments to

<Q>An act to repeal &s;o much of a former act as &s;u&s;pends the i&s;&s;uing of executions upon certain judgment until December 1783.</Q>
By the &s;econd &s;ection it is enacted
<Q>that no debt or debt or demand what&s;oever, originally due to a &s;ubject of Great-Britain &s;hall be recoverable in any court in this Commonwealth, although the &s;ame may be transferred to a citizen of this &s;tate, or to any other per&s;on capable of maintaining &s;uch ac|tion, unle&s;s the a&s;&s;ignment hath been or may be made for a valuable con&s;ideration, bona &s;ide paid before the fir&s;t day of May, in the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy &s;even, the proof of which con&s;ideration and the time thereof, &s;hall be on the plaintiff.</Q>

The &s;tate of war created this di&s;ability in Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who being enemies could not maintain actions in our courts. But &s;uits might have been pro&s;ecuted, upon debts of this kind a&s;&s;igned to citizens. This during the trouble and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the war would have been oppre&s;&s;ive and intolerable, and it called for the pre|ventive aid of the legi&s;lature: Therefore this act was made, which may be rea&s;onably re&s;trained to the re|covery of Briti&s;h debts a&s;&s;igned to citizens; and if this be the mo&s;t proper con&s;truction it follows that no impediment has ari&s;en to Briti&s;h creditors from this law.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it mu&s;t be under&s;tood more gene|rally, yet it will be found not to have been in force longer than July 1784, if &s;o long.

This is conceived to be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the acts of May and October 1782. Be|&s;ides the latter contains a &s;entence of repeal of every part of the former not compatible with the latter. If then the act of May 1782 be dige&s;ted, amended and merged in the act of October 1782, which was temporary, it may be con&s;idered as being out of force with the act of October 1782. It is admitted as laid down in Hobart, 215, that an affirmative con|tinuance for a limitted time, of a perpetual &s;tatute will not abrogate it, after the expiration of the limit+ed time, but this rule does not apply to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where a perpetual &s;tatute was dige&s;ted, merged and re-enacted under additional modifications by a|nother &s;tatute which was limited in its duration.

<P>From this view which has been fairly pre&s;ented of the acts of Virginia, there &s;eem &s;trong grounds for the opinion, that independent of the operation of the treaty of peace, there was no law in force in that &s;tate which prohibited Briti&s;h &s;ubjects from recover|ing their ju&s;t debts from the date of the peace, and at all events from the  <GAP DESC="blank">  of July, 1784, when the aforementioned acts of 1782 expired.

<P>Secondly. The operation of the treaty of peace upon the acts of Virginia, will now claim &s;ome atten|tion. It is contended that the treaty abrogated all the legi&s;lative acts of Virginia, which were contrary to it if any &s;uch were to be found. On the 14th of January, 1784, Congre&s;s ratified it, and proclaimed it the law of the land, and required it to be executed and obeyed accordingly. In this light it was gene|rally con&s;idered throughout the United States; and it is not believed that any judicial deci&s;ion was ever made to the contrary by the judges of any court in any &s;tate; and if by accident &s;uch a deci&s;ion was ever made, it may be pronounced to be erroneous, and it would have been corrected if it had been carried be|fore

In confirmation of this doctrine, the unani|mous judgment the circuit court of the United States in the di&s;trict of North-Carolina held in June 1796, in the ca&s;e of Hamiltons again&s;t Eaton, may be cited as of the highe&s;t authority. Chief ju&s;tice Ell&s;worth in delivering his &s;entiments ob&s;erved with his u&s;ual &s;trength and per&s;picuity of expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q>As to the opinion that a treaty does not annul a &s;tatute, &s;o far as there is an interference, it is un&s;ound. A &s;tatute is a declaration of the public will, and of high authority; but it is controulable by the public will &s;ub&s;equently declared. Thence the maxim, that where two &s;tatutes are oppo&s;ed to each other, the latter abrogates the former. Nor is it material as to the effect of the public will, what organ it is declared by, provided it be an organ con&s;tituti|onally authori&s;ed to make the declaration. A trea|ty when it is in fact made, is with regard to each nation that is a party to it, a national act, an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the national will, as much &s;o as a &s;ta|tute can be. And it does, therefore, of nece&s;&s;ity, annul any prior &s;tatute &s;o far as there is an inter|ference. The &s;uppo&s;ition that the public can have two wills at the &s;ame time, repugnant to each other, one expre&s;&s;ed by &s;tatute and another by a treaty, is ab&s;urd.</Q></P>

<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons by which the agent for the United States maintains the propo&s;ition, that in Virginia there was no legal impediment to the re|covery of Briti&s;h debts, &s;ub&s;equent to the peace of 1783, or at all events, &s;ub&s;equent to July 1784. If this &s;hall have been &s;atisfactorily proved to the board, it will be difficult to produce any ca&s;e grounded on a debt contracted in Virginia, where according to the treaties, the creditors will be entitled to reparation from the trea&s;ury of the United States. It is there|fore a mo&s;t important point to be determined by the board. It is not denied that the Briti&s;h creditors generally entertained the opinion that &s;uits were not maintainable in the courts of Virginia, and con&s;e|quently the fact was, that very few &s;uits were com|menced by them 'till the operation of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States. This was a wilful omi&s;&s;ion on their part, and e&s;pecially on the part of tho&s;e who were advi&s;ed, by re&s;pectable coun&s;el, that the courts were open to the recovery of their debts.</P>

<P>Virginia is divided into counties and judicial di&s;|tricts. In each county are a convenient number of ju&s;tices of the peace; who po&s;&s;e&s;s juri&s;diction &s;ingly to hear and determine all claims for debt under five dollars and award execution again&s;t the debtors goods and chattels. In each county a court which is a court of record, con&s;i&s;ting of any four or more of the ju&s;tices, is to be held every month, who have final ju|ri&s;diction to hear and determine in a &s;ummary way on all demands of debts under twenty dollars, and to hear and determine all actions founded on contract, where the &s;um in controver&s;y amounts to twenty dol|lars or more, and all actions founded on tort, accord|ing to the principles of common law or chancery, as the ca&s;e may require; and their juri&s;diction is final in common law ca&s;es founded on contract where the judgment is for le&s;s than one hundred dollars, if for more, it may be carried into the Di&s;trict court for correction, by writ of error or appeal, upon giving approved &s;ecurity for &s;atisfying the judgment and da|mages for the delay, if affirmed, and in Chancery ca&s;es an appeal lies to the high court of Chancery, on giv|ing approved &s;ecurity for performing the decree if affirmed. The rules of proceeding are declared by law, &s;o that they are not only ea&s;ily under&s;tood but productive of an uniform practice. The&s;e rules are generally derived from the mo&s;t improved practice of the courts of King's Bench, and of Chancery in Eng|land, with &s;uch alterations and additions as by expe|rience have been found to render them more cheap,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William Cun|ningham and company, li&s;t A.</NOTE>Upon examining this li&s;t which contains debts claimed from thirty-&s;ix individuals, amounting to the &s;um of &pound;. 217.7.11, of which &pound;. 207.9 7&frac12; are &s;tated to be good, and the re&s;idue &pound;. 9.18 3&frac12; to be doubtful, a que&s;tion naturally ari&s;es upon what grounds do the claimants demand payment of the &s;everal &s;ums &s;et forth in this li&s;t from the United States. As to tho&s;e which are &s;tated to be good, why have not &s;uits been brought? In &s;uch ca&s;es can it be &s;aid that full compen&s;ation is not attainable in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings until a trial &s;hall be made? Can this be admitted to be true as to all the&s;e ca&s;es in aggregate? Perhaps in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces compen&s;ation might be had if it was &s;ought in the tribunals having cognizance and the&s;e in&s;tances ought to be deducted.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e thirty-&s;ix ca&s;es twelve are cognizable be|fore a &s;ingle magi&s;trate, each being under the &s;um of five dollars, one is for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as one &s;hil|ling and two pence: other twelve are recoverable in a &s;ummary way by petition before a county court, each being for a &s;um le&s;s than twenty dollars. While &s;uch demands furni&s;h a proof of the extreme care and indu&s;try with which the claimants have been glean|ing their books and papers, they are liable to this ob|jection, that the two nations never contemplated &s;uch to be &s;ubject to the awards of the commi&s;&s;ioners. Not only the maxim, de minimis non curat lex, but the honor and dignity of the nations dictate their exclu&s;ion. If it be &s;aid that the principles of equity are the &s;ame, whether the debt be one &s;hilling or

one hundred pounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Cun|ningham and company, li&s;t A.</NOTE> let it be ob&s;erved that there will be required the &s;ame proofs and con&s;equently the &s;ame trouble to inve&s;tigate a claim for the &s;maller as for the larger &s;um. Did Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay intend this? Did the nations intend it? Or was the trea&s;ury of the United States to be re&s;orted to for all the little balances due in America to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to &s;ave them the inconvenience of reque&s;ting payment from the debtors? In all &s;uch ca&s;es payment it is pre&s;umable would be made on reque&s;t where the demand is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the other remaining twelve ca&s;es in li&s;t A. how is the a&s;&s;ertion proved that they are not recover|able in the courts of Virginia. Each of the&s;e is re|pre&s;ented to be good, that is to &s;ay, due from a &s;ol|vent per&s;on. With re&s;pect to the&s;e, the attention of the board is reque&s;ted to all tho&s;e ob&s;ervations which have been made in a general point of view, relative to the interpretation of the treaties, relative to the mat|ters which ought to be proved by the claimants, and relative to the judiciary of Virginia. It may here be added as a general rule, that the creditors ought to go before the ordinary tribunals with their claims, and ought to u&s;e rea&s;onable endeavours to obtain payment from the debtors capable of paying, before the United States &s;hall be charged. The&s;e endea|vours &s;hould be made to appear before the commi&s;|&s;ioners, and ought not to be pre&s;umed. Equity re|quires this not only for the rea&s;ons that have been given, but becau&s;e in &s;uits again&s;t the debtors, &s;ome in&s;tances will probably occur where the debts appear|ing

to be due,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Cun|ningham and company, li&s;t A.</NOTE> according to the books of the mer|chants, can and will be proved by the debtors to have been in whole or in part paid. Such in&s;tances the agent of the United States is authorized to de|clare, have occurred in Virginia. It is al&s;o thought rea&s;onable that the creditor &s;hould go through the &s;ame labor and preparation to obtain payment from the debtor, who is not certainly in&s;olvent, as if no treaty had been made. To ea&s;e him of this was not the intent of the treaty. Again, &s;ome claims were barred by the acts of limitation before the commence|ment of the war, and &s;uch cannot be rea&s;onably brought within the operation of the treaty, or it will have an operation retro-active to the fir&s;t &s;ettlements in America. As to intere&s;t on the&s;e ca&s;es, where the creditors and debtors re&s;ided in Virginia at the time the debts were contracted, in retail dealing, it may well be doubted whether intere&s;t is ju&s;tly recoverable. For goods &s;old, it was not u&s;ual in Virginia to al|low intere&s;t in judicial deci&s;ions before the war, and therefore they were &s;old at a higher price. The ex|orbitance of price compen&s;ated for the denial of in|tere&s;t. At common law, book debts do not of cour&s;e carry intere&s;t, and if it be payable at all, it mu&s;t be in con&s;equence of cu&s;tom or of &s;ome &s;pecial agree|ment, or,
<Q>in ca&s;es of long delay under vexatious and oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances,</Q>
of which a jury in their di&s;cretion may judge. The&s;e are the words of Lord Mansfield in the ca&s;e of Eddowes vs. Har|ris's executors. Dougla&s;s 361. Admitting this rule to be proper as here laid down, and that the u&s;age in Virginia was to di&s;allow intere&s;t on book-debts, and that no &s;pecial agreement exi&s;ted in any

of the&s;e ca&s;es in li&s;t A. it follows that unle&s;s there has been long delay under vexatious and oppre&s;&s;ive cir|cum&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Cun|ningham and company, li&s;t A.</NOTE> there is not ground to demand intere&s;t on the&s;e accounts. As to long delay, the creditor, for aught appears, has not even a&s;ked payment; cer|tainly he has not &s;ued, but has neglected from the time of the peace, or at any rate from July 1784, to &s;ue as it has been &s;hewn he might have done. As to vex|atious and oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances, they, it is hoped, will not be the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will draw forth an enquiry into the conduct of the two nations relative to the non-execution of the treaty of peace, which has been wi&s;ely con&s;igned to oblivion by the treaty of 1794; and therefore it would very improperly be &s;tirred, even if any &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances exi&s;ted before the national arbitrators: But if it is, the agent for the United States re&s;erves to him&s;elf the privilege of a copious and thorough di&s;qui&s;ition. With re&s;pect to intere&s;t during the war, on debts of this kind, an additional argument to what has been urged on this head, ought not to be omitted. The creditors and their factors left Vir|ginia and carried away their books and vouchers, and were inacce&s;&s;able to the debtors 'till the return of peace. The place of payment was in Virginia, and the debtors were not bound to pay while there was no per&s;on there to receive payment; and this alone ought to di&s;charge the claim of intere&s;t during the war, in ca&s;es of this kind. So it has been judicially determined in the court of appeals of Virginia, in the ca&s;e of M'Call, vs. Turner. No. 1. A manu&s;cript re|port of which ca&s;e, taken by one of the able and ju|dicious coun&s;el of that court, is annexed for the &s;a|tisfaction

Before this time, many had voluntarily gone, and only &s;uch of tho&s;e who re|mained were ordered away, who had given proofs of their di&s;affection to the cau&s;e of America. It was there|fore their own act, their preference to the cau&s;e of Great Britain that occa&s;ioned their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances it was moderation, laudable mo|deration, on the part of Virginia, to permit or direct them to be ab&s;ent.

&s;uch in&s;tance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Cun|ningham and company, li&s;t B.</NOTE> Thomas Gordon the agent for the claimants, has &s;ubjoined a remark which applies to each li&s;t, that each is characterized agreeable to a li&s;t in 1775. A doubt ari&s;es on the meaning of this phra&s;e. If under&s;tood to mean among other things the &s;olvency or in&s;olvency of the debtors in 1775 it is hoped that tho&s;e that are &s;tated then to have been doubtful &s;hall be excluded, unle&s;s &s;olvency &s;hall be actually and &s;atisfactorily proven &s;ub&s;equent to the peace, as well as all the other requi&s;ites that have formerly in the general argument been urged to be indi&s;pen&s;able to entitle a claim to redre&s;s under the treaty of 1794. Tho&s;e which are then repre&s;ented to be good, it is in&s;i&s;ted ought to be proved to have continued good on the third day of September 1783 when the treaty of peace was concluded. And on this occa&s;ion it is repeated that wherever the in&s;ol|vency happened before the date of the treaty of peace, no circum&s;tances can bring any lo&s;s ari&s;ing from thence within the meaning of the 6th article of the treaty of 1794.

One ob&s;ervation relative to intere&s;t during the war mu&s;t however be here mentioned. By the municipal law of Virginia of an ancient &s;tanding, it is enacted
<Q>That in all actions which &s;hall be brought upon any bond or bonds for the payment of money wherein the plaintiff &s;hall re|cover, judgment &s;hall be entered for the penalty of &s;uch bond to be di&s;charged by payment of the

A contrary opinion was however once expre&s;&s;ed in the ca&s;e of Jones' executors vs. Hylton by the chief ju&s;tice of the United States on the meaning of this act, who thought where the debt was evidenced by a bond, that the jury had no power over the intere&s;t but it accrued of cour&s;e. This opinion, though proceeding from a mo&s;t re&s;pected judge, was never approved by the bar or bench of the &s;tate of Vir|ginia, and a different interpretation has prevailed there. This matter is explained in order that the opinion of the chief ju&s;tice may not improperly in|fluence the que&s;tion, whether in equity intere&s;t dur|ing the war is payable. It was not on principles of equity but on the &s;tatute of Virginia &s;trictly con&s;i|dered that the opinion was expre&s;&s;ed which with great deference to the able and learned Judge, has been generally deemed erroneous. The ca&s;e of M' Call vs. Turner is in point and expre&s;&s;es the unani|mous judgment of the court of appeals in that &s;tate.</P>

<P>Re&s;pecting the 2d cla&s;s. It has been denied that any legal impediment to the recovery of the Briti&s;h debts exi&s;ted in Virginia &s;ince the peace. The trea|ty of peace repealed all acts anterior to it, which created any &s;uch impediments, and no laws of that kind were pa&s;&s;ed po&s;terior to it, unle&s;s the continu|ance of the acts of May and October 1782, 'till July 1784, be &s;aid to be one.</P>
<P>This point the agent for the United States hopes, with confidence, has been fully and &s;atisfactorily pro|ven to the board, and to his former arguments he prays leave to refer.

The latter &s;hall be left in the point of view in which it has been placed.

No new law was introduced on this &s;ubject, and therefore this conduct of juries or courts cannot be truly repre&s;ented as a legal impedi|ment in the contemplation of the treaty of 1783.

Or can it be under&s;tood to require the in&s;titution of new laws or a new mode for deciding upon and recover|ing debts contracted before the war?

If this be admitted to be correct it follows that it is expre&s;sly excluded from the provi&s;ion of the 6th article of the treaty of 1794, and that no award can be made again&s;t the United States for compen&s;ation of intere&s;t that is deducted by the com|petent tribunal in the ordinary cour&s;e of proceeding, according to ancient u&s;age and laws.

<HEAD>M'CALL vs. TURNER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an appeal from a judgment of the di&s;trict court of King and Queen, upon the follow|ing ca&s;e. On the 18th day of January 1774. Reu|ben Wright, Reuben Turner, Benjamin C. Spiller and William Aylett, entered into a bond of the u&s;ual form, to Robert M'Kendli&s;h, in the penalty of fifty five pounds with condition to be void on payment of twenty &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings on or before the fir&s;t day of October thence next following,
<Q>with intere&s;t from the date;</Q>
which bond M'Kindli&s;h a&s;&s;igned to the plaintiff by an indor&s;ement in the&s;e words, "Pay the within to Archibald M'Call" and &s;igned his name to the &s;aid indor&s;ement. In July 1793, M'Call brought &s;uit upon this bond in the di&s;trict court of King and Queen, again&s;t Reuben Wright, Reuben Turner and Benjamin C. Spiller, the &s;urviving oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs; for William Aylett was then dead. The writ was executed by the &s;heriff of King William, on Reuben Turner only, and Spiller and Wright were returned "no inhabitants." The plain|tiff filed a declaration on the above bond in the common form of declarations upon a&s;&s;igned bonds; after which follows an entry in the&s;e words,
<Q>Abated as to the defendants Reuben Wright and Benja|min C. Spiller, by the return, and a conditional order again&s;t the defendant Reuben Turner and James Turner bail for appearance.</Q>
The condi|tional order was confirmed at the next rules; and at
<PB N="iv" REF="034906_0090_0FFF94002914DC68">
the &s;ucceeding court Reuben Turner gave &s;pecial bail, pleaded payment, and the plaintiff took i&s;&s;ue. In April 1795, the cau&s;e &s;tood for trial; and the jury being charged upon the i&s;&s;ue, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the courts opinion, which &s;tated that
<Q>the defendant by his coun&s;el moved the court to be permitted to give in evidence to the jury that the plaintiff was ab&s;ent in foreign ports beyond &s;eas, and not within the &s;tate of Virginia for the &s;pace of eight years, to wit, from the 19th day of April 1775, to the 19th day of April 1783, and that during that period, he had not any known agent or attorney within the commonwealth, who would receive payment of the debt and give a legal di&s;charge for the &s;ame, on which the &s;uit is found|ed, with a view of extingui&s;hing the intere&s;t dur|ing that period, to which the coun&s;el for the plaintiff objected, but the court permitted the defendant to offer &s;uch evidence if he &s;hould think fit &s;o to do. And the defendant being per|mitted to give evidence to the jury, to the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid, it was proved that the plaintiff was out of Virginia in ports beyond &s;ea, from &s;ome time in the year 1775, to &s;ome time in the year 1783, which was permitted to go to the jury.</Q>
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant had not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned, but that the &s;ame ought however to be di&s;charged by the payment of twenty &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings with intere&s;t thereon from the date of the bond until the 19th day of April 1775, and from the 19th day of April 1783, until paid, and a&s;&s;igned damages to a penny; and the court gave judgment for the plaintiff,
<PB N="v" REF="034906_0091_0FFF94029B8F8AC0">
for the penalty of the bond to be di&s;charged accord|ing to the terms of the verdict with co&s;ts of &s;uit From which judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court.</P>
<P>WARDEN for the appellant. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much upon this &s;ubject; for the record &s;hews mani|fe&s;t error in the opinion of the court in permitting improper evidence to be given to the jury. The plea was payment, and nothing but what went to prove that &s;hould have been received; for nothing el&s;e was within the i&s;&s;ue. The notice was not that the defen|dant would prove a payment, but that the plaintiff was ab&s;ent during a certain period; within which it does not appear that there was no agent here to re|ceive the money, had &s;uch a fact ever been material which it was not. All that the jury upon this i&s;&s;ue could do, was to find whether the defendant had paid the debt or not; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e if travelling out of the i&s;&s;ue they of their own accord &s;hould dimini&s;h the debt, it would be the duty of the court to grant a new trial. The law is that judgment &s;hall be entered for the penalty, to be di&s;charged by the payment of the principal debt with intere&s;t and co&s;ts; and &s;o it is con&s;tantly done in ca&s;es of judgments by default; which proves the law to be as I have &s;tated it. Al|though the bill of exceptions does not &s;tate that this was all the evidence, yet it is fair to infer that there was no other, as none appears; and therefore I con|clude that the evidence offered by the defendant was inadmi&s;&s;ible: and con&s;equently that the judgment is erroneous and ought to be rever&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="034906_0092_0FFF94051E5555C8">WICKHAM for the appellee. This was a &s;uit upon a joint bond, which could neither be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or pro&s;ecuted &s;everally. The plaintiff therefore &s;hould have pur&s;ued all the obligors, and &s;hould not have abated the &s;uit as to the non-re&s;ident defendants; for he thereby di&s;continued as to him who was arre&s;ted. It may be &s;aid that this &s;hould have been pleaded in abatement; but that was not nece&s;&s;ary, as it appears upon the record: and Turner could not have pleaded it, be|cau&s;e the declaration was joint. The act of A&s;&s;em|bly had provided the means of bringing all the par|ties before the court, and therefore it ought to have been done. At lea&s;t the plaintiff &s;hould have follow|ed up his proce&s;s.</P>
<P>Then as to the point concerning the evidence:&mdash; My own impre&s;&s;ion from the act of A&s;&s;embly origi|nally was, that the jury were merely to find if any and what payments had been made, and that the court was to a&s;certain the re&s;t; but on my fir&s;t com|ing to the bar, I found the practice &s;ettled the other way, and that the jury were to find the &s;um by which the penalty was to be di&s;charged: which I pre&s;ume was done upon a proper con&s;ideration of the law. I had occa&s;ion once to &s;ubmit this que&s;tion to the federal court, and contended that the jury &s;hould find the payments &s;pecially; but the court enquired into the practice of Mr. Brown the clerk of the gene|ral court, and being informed that the practice was to find generally they &s;ubmitted the cau&s;e to the jury. Therefore I conclude that the practice is &s;ettled, that the jury may enquire into the amount; and of cour&s;e mu&s;t be regulated by evidence and the circum&s;tan|ces.
<PB N="vii" REF="034906_0093_0FFF9408838E0CA8">
Perhaps the circum&s;tances do not all appear in this ca&s;e; but if under any circum&s;tances there might be a deduction of intere&s;t, the court will &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e circum&s;tances were proved upon the trial, as every thing tran&s;acted in a court of ju&s;tice is pre|&s;umed to be rightly done until the contrary is &s;hewn. The que&s;tion therefore is, whether under any cir|cum&s;tances a deduction of intere&s;t can be made by the jury?</P>
<P>The act of A&s;&s;embly does not &s;tate from what pe|riod intere&s;t &s;hall commence; and I &s;uppo&s;e the act was founded on the practice of the court of chan|cery of relieving again&s;t the penalty on payment of principal, intere&s;t and co&s;ts. Now in a court of e|quity circum&s;tances would clearly be taken into con|&s;ideration, and a deduction made or not according as they &s;hould appear. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e all the cir|cum&s;tances do not appear, but there are &s;everal men|tioned which afford an equity. The plaintiff was ab&s;ent during all the interval mentioned in the re|cord, and had no known agent to whom payment could be made, which of it&s;elf affords a &s;trong rea+&s;on for &s;u&s;pending the intere&s;t; but if during that period he went into the ho&s;tile country and became an alien enemy, &s;o that the defendant was prohi|bited from having any intercour&s;e with or paying him the money, in that ca&s;e the deduction would be more rea&s;onable &s;till. For it would be again&s;t con|&s;cience that the creditor &s;hould demand intere&s;t when his own ab&s;ence was the cau&s;e why the debt was not paid. I dont &s;ay this was the ca&s;e, or what kind of proof was actually made, but as nothing contrary to
<PB N="viii" REF="034906_0094_0FFF940A0783EB70">
what I &s;tated appears, the court will intend that tho&s;e circum&s;tances or &s;ome &s;uch were proved; for the rea&s;on before given, that whatever is tran&s;acted in a court of ju&s;tice is pre&s;umed to be rightly done until the contrary is &s;hewn.</P>
<P>WARDEN. As to the que&s;tion concerning the abate|ment, there is no difficulty in it. The &s;heriff is bound to return the truth of the ca&s;e, for otherwi&s;e the pro|ce&s;s might be infinite. In the county courts it has been con&s;tantly done both before and &s;ince the revo|lution. When this &s;uit was commenced the di&s;trict courts did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of i&s;&s;uing me&s;ne pro|ce&s;s out of the limits of the di&s;trict. There is a ma|nife&s;t difference in this re&s;pect between the act of 1788, under which this &s;uit was brought, and the act of 1792, &s;poken of by Mr. Wickham. The le|gi&s;lature by allowing copies of bonds to be u&s;ed in|&s;tead of the originals in &s;uits brought in other di&s;|tricts plainly intended to provide again&s;t the defect of limited juri&s;diction. The plaintiff proceeding un|der the act of 1788, was obliged to &s;ubmit to the abatement; for he could not follow up the proce&s;s as to the non-re&s;ident defendants.</P>
<P>Then as to the point of evidence;&mdash;Any thing el&s;e might as well have been proved on the plea of pay|ment as the ab&s;ence of the party. If the defendant had pleaded the fact &s;pecially it would have been demurrable to; which proves that &s;uch evidence before the jury cannot be admitted: for whatever goes to the de&s;truction of the plaintiff's right may be pleaded. Even a tender in this ca&s;e would not have
<PB N="ix" REF="034906_0095_0FFF940B89BD1678">
availed; becau&s;e the day of payment had arrived, before the plaintiffs departure from the &s;tate. A ca&s;e in the federal court was mentioned which I do not re|collect; but I remember that, in the ca&s;e of Jones's executors vs. Hylton, chief ju&s;tice J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y was of opini|on that the jury could not deduct impre&s;s; for he &s;aid it was the act of the court to a&s;certain the amount &s;till due after the payments were deducted, which was all that the jury could enquire into. It has been &s;aid by &s;ome that no particular intere&s;t was fixed by law; becau&s;e the act of a&s;&s;embly does not &s;ay that any intere&s;t &s;hould be received in &s;o many words, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t only that not more than five per cent &s;hall be taken. Though the law has &s;aid that the obligee &s;hall not take more than five per cent, it certainly implies that he may take that; and the uniform practice of the country has been to give judgment for it, which proves the univer&s;al opinion of the law. By the treaty of peace we agreed to the payment; and there is no exception in it of cour&s;e where the party was ab&s;ent. It is therefore a reflection on the &s;tate, and renders us rediculous in the eyes of foreigners, that our juries have &s;o long per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to per|form the &s;tipulation and to find the full amount due to tho&s;e creditors.</P>
<P>The judges now delivered their opinions &s;eparately to the following effect.</P>
<P>Fleming judge. There were two points made in this cau&s;e; one by the appellants coun&s;el on the propriety of admitting the evidence in order to ex|tingui&s;h the intere&s;t during the ab&s;ence of the plain|tiff
<PB N="x" REF="034906_0096_0FFF9434D3D78B48">
from this country: and the other by the defen|dants coun&s;el on the ground that the plaintiff by fail|ing to continue the proce&s;s again&s;t the non-re&s;ident defendants had di&s;continued his &s;uit altogether.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t que&s;tion it was &s;aid by the coun&s;el for the appellants that &s;uch evidence could not be given upon the trial of an i&s;&s;ue on the plea of payment; and that po&s;ition is correct if the ca&s;e be con&s;idered upon the doctrines of the common law only. But the act of a&s;&s;embly has altered the common law; and by allowing the penalty "to be di&s;charged by payment of the principal and the intere&s;t due there|on," with the co&s;ts of &s;uit, has nece&s;&s;arily turned the quantum into a que&s;tion to be determined by circum&s;tances: and I think it was the province of the jury to decide that que&s;tion. The plaintiff by ab&s;ent|ing him&s;elf from the country put it out of the power of the debtor to make payment; and therefore it is unrea&s;onable that he &s;hould demand intere&s;t during that period. This was a circum&s;tance proper to be left to the jury, upon a plea of this kind in an action of debt upon a bond. It is like collateral evidence to mitigate damages in actions of a&s;&s;ault and battery.</P>
<P>As to the other point, the act of a&s;&s;embly does not give &s;uch exten&s;ive juri&s;diction as the coun&s;il for the appellees contended for; and the clau&s;e relative to the copy of the bond proves it. Which would have been unnece&s;&s;ary if the court had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed general juri&s;diction &s;o as to force the appearance of non-re&s;ident defendants from other di&s;tricts. However according to any con&s;truction, I think it ought

to have been pleaded; and therefore I am of opini|on that the judgment of the court was right upon both points, and ought to be affirmed.</P>
<P>Carrington judge. Every que&s;tion in this ca&s;e might have been &s;aved except that upon the bill of excep|tions. If Mr. Wickhams argument was correct a judgment might never be obtained, where there are &s;everal defendants; becau&s;e it would &s;eldom happen that they all could be found in one di&s;trict: and the act of a&s;&s;embly does not admit of the enlarged ju|ri&s;diction which he contends it does. For although the words of the provi&s;o page 83, are calculated to give that impre&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t view, yet a clo&s;er at|tention will lead to another con&s;truction; becau&s;e the next member of the &s;entence which allows a copy to be given in evidence would according to the other interpretation have been wholly unnece&s;&s;ary. But let the expo&s;ition be what it may, the matter &s;hould have been pleaded in abatement; without which if it even be admitted that the argument of the appellees coun&s;el is correct, no advantage can be taken of it. Upon that ground therefore I think there is no error.</P>
<P>The whole que&s;tion then re&s;ts upon the other point; and I am of opinion that the jury had the right of deciding what was the amount of the intere&s;t due&middot; The act of a&s;&s;embly &s;eems to me e&s;&s;entially to inve&s;t them with this power; for the expre&s;s language is that the penalty &s;hall be di&s;charged
<Q>by payment of the principal and the intere&s;t due thereon,</Q>
with the co&s;ts of &s;uit. Who then are to &s;ay what intere&s;t

is due thereon? The jury &s;urely; who mu&s;t decide upon the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, and &s;ay when it &s;hall commence, how long it &s;hould continue, and when it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended or extingui&s;hed. On all general i&s;&s;ues (and this is one) the whole circum|&s;tances of the ca&s;e &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the jury, who are to decide accordingly.</P>
<P>As to the ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e I do not think its be|ing a Briti&s;h debt or not makes any difference. The &s;ame rule would apply in a ca&s;e between two citi|zens. Now &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e between two citizens, in which one is creditor and the other debtor; and that the creditor removes him&s;elf into parts of the world unknown to his debtor: who thereby cannot come at him in order to make payment, would it be ju&s;t in &s;uch a ca&s;e that full intere&s;t &s;hould be given; and ought not the jury to enquire into the circum&s;tances and reduce the intere&s;t accordingly?&mdash;Again &s;uppo&s;e there be a bargain and &s;ale of property, and that the &s;eller keeps the property a long time; would it be right that he &s;hould recover intere&s;t upon the pur|cha&s;e money during the time of his unju&s;t detention of the property?&mdash;Surely not; no jury would do otherwi&s;e than deduct it: and I think the act of a&s;|&s;embly would warrant them in doing &s;o. In this ca&s;e the plaintiff ab&s;ented him&s;elf, and went into a country with which we had no intercour&s;e, and did not return until &s;ome time in the year 1783; &s;o that his debtor could not make payment to him or by remittance. If under the&s;e circum&s;tances he were to have full intere&s;t he would be better off than our own citizens who &s;tayed at home and braved the dan|gers

of the war. Upon the whole, the trial appears to have been fair; the plaintiff had notice of the evidence: the verdict I think was ju&s;t, and did not in my opinion endanger the honor of the country. I am therefore for affirming the judgment.</P>
<P>Pendleton Pre&s;ident. It was objected by the coun|&s;el for the appellee that the plaintiff had &s;uffered the &s;uit to be abated as to the non-re&s;ident parties, whom it was &s;aid he ought to have pur&s;ued by continuing the proce&s;s; and that having &s;ailed to do &s;o he had di&s;continued his &s;uit. I thought at fir&s;t, from a &s;light reading of the act of a&s;&s;embly, that a te&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m capias might in the ca&s;e of a joint bond be i&s;&s;ued into any county; but on a more attentive peru&s;al of the law I find I was mi&s;taken, and that the fir&s;t part of the provi&s;o is corrected by the latter, which allows the party to make u&s;e of a copy, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where all the defendants are not arre&s;ted in the &s;ame di&s;|trict. The provi&s;o though was for the benefit of the plaintiff who might waive it if he would. It was &s;aid by the coun&s;el for the appellee that the defendant could not have pleaded it in abatement, becau&s;e the declaration was joint; but the fact appeared upon the record, and therefore might have been in&s;i&s;ted on by way of plea if the objection had been main|tainable. The defendant however might upon his part al&s;o waive the objection if he would; and by going on to trial without taking any notice of it, he certainly has done &s;o.</P>
<P>Then as to the que&s;tion with regard to the pro|priety
<PB N="xiv" REF="034906_0100_0FFF941253D312C0">
of the evidence. The ju&s;tice of the defence was impeached; and it was a&s;ked whether it was right that a Briti&s;h &s;ubject &s;hould lo&s;e intere&s;t on his debt during the continuance of the war between that country and this? The affirmative it was &s;aid would be di&s;honorable to the &s;tate; and that it was di&s;grace|ful to the people of this country that the juries had per&s;i&s;ted &s;o long in deducting intere&s;t during that period. I am &s;en&s;ible that politics ought not to en|ter into judicial determinations, for which rea&s;on I have u&s;ually avoided them; and I tru&s;t I am an im|partial judge upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, unle&s;s it &s;hall be &s;uppo&s;ed that I am under any national preju|dices, of which however I am not con&s;cious. Un|der the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions I will endeavor to redeem my country from the grievous imputation which has been laid upon it; and I cannot &s;ay that I think the ver|dict wrong upon the ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e. I am an enemy to war and all its con&s;equences; but if we compare the conduct of the two nations the compar|i&s;on is evidently in favor of America. Our &s;eque&s;|tration laws &s;ecured the proceeds of the property in the public trea&s;ury, and waited for the conduct of the mother country; but did Great Britain meet us on the &s;ame liberal ground? I wi&s;h the circum|&s;tances forgotten; and it is with an ill grace that tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould recall the painful remembrance of them, which were &s;o many deflections from the modern rules of warfare; and did not in my opinion, entitle the creditors even to the prin|cipal debts them&s;elves, had they not been &s;tipulated for by the treaty of peace. With which however,
<PB N="xv" REF="034906_0101_0FFF9414C3B55740">
I dont find fault; for although it was unju&s;t and inconvenient in one re&s;pect, yet as the other parts were e&s;teemed beneficial it was right to accept it, for the &s;ake of the general advantages it contained: and having been entered into it &s;hould be performed, provided Great Britain had fulfilled her part of it. But this however is now out of the que&s;tion; it is &s;ettled that the debts are to be paid: and the only point which remains to be con&s;idered, is, whether the creditors are entitled to intere&s;t during the war? We were attacked by a great and powerful nation, who entering our country with force, obliged us to call forth every re&s;ource, and to exert every means of defence; &s;o that the debtor, in&s;tead of providing for the payment of his debt, was con&s;tantly engaged in the protection of his family: and might there|fore well be excu&s;ed for not paying his debt during a period in which he was prevented from attending to his private affairs, by the calamities of a war which his creditor was a&s;&s;i&s;ting to excite. According to the modern practice of nations, all that the credi|tors could have expected, was to be put in the &s;ame &s;ituatiom with re&s;pect to the recovery of their debts, as our own citizens were; but the latter be&s;ides the depredations of war, &s;u&s;tained immen&s;e lo&s;&s;es from various cau&s;es which that had introduced, and are daily &s;ubject to the lo&s;s not only of intere&s;t but of principal too, and no good rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned why the other &s;ide &s;hould have been put upon a bet|ter footing. If a citizen creditor had removed him&s;elf to other parts of the world in the &s;ame manner, and left his debtor to fight the battles of his
<PB N="xvi" REF="034906_0102_0FFF94164780B338">
country, it would have been a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for taking off the intere&s;t during that period; and the rea&s;on certainly holds with as much force when ap|plied to tho&s;e who were on the &s;ide of the people with whom we were contending. This is my opin|ion, and whether it be right or wrong mu&s;t be re|ferred to a more unerring tribunal hereafter!</P>
<P>Then as to the mode of proceeding; the que&s;|tion is, whether evidence of the&s;e facts could be gi|ven to the jury on the plea of payment? The ar|gument, that it could not be done at common law is true; becau&s;e the whole penalty was forfeited if only a &s;hilling was due: and therefore it was to no purpo&s;e to offer evidence to dimini&s;h the debt; for that did not excu&s;e the penalty. This drove the de|fendant into equity to &s;uch a di&s;charge by payment of the principal, intere&s;t and co&s;ts; where relief upon tho&s;e terms was con&s;tantly obtained. But this was found to be trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive; and therefore the legi&s;lature interfered and pa&s;&s;ed the act of a&s;&s;embly for that purpo&s;e: which not only allows payments, but di&s;counts too, to be given in evidence at the trial. Now, if in&s;tead of paying intere&s;t on the debt, proof can be given to the jury di&s;clo&s;ing a rea&s;on why intere&s;t &s;hould not be paid, why &s;hould it not be received and the court allow the jury to con&s;ider of it? I can di&s;cern no good objection to it; nor do I think that any can be offered. I ob&s;erved that the act of a&s;&s;embly was founded on the practice of the court of chancery; and in a court of equity evidence of the circum&s;tances would certainly be
<PB N="xvii" REF="034906_0103_0FFF9418CCCF82B0">
received, and a deduction of intere&s;t made or not ac|cording to them. The trial here was fair; even no|tice of the evidence was given, though that perhaps was not nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore I &s;ee no rea&s;on to di&s;turb the verdict. The opinion of the chief ju&s;tice of the United States in a ca&s;e before the federal court was cited; in which he is &s;tated to have deliv|ered to the jury a charge differing from the opinion I have ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed; but I cannot concur with him. He is reported to have &s;aid, that intere&s;t was que&s;|tion of law; which I do not agree to: for no law has &s;aid in expre&s;s terms when intere&s;t &s;hall com|mence." The jury in the ca&s;e before the federal court deducted the intere&s;t; and to them I think it emphatically belonged to decide whether it &s;hould be paid or not. I concur therefore, with the other judges who have delivered their opinions, that the judgment in this ca&s;e ought to be affirmed upon both the points which have been made in the cau&s;e.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<P>FOR the &s;ake of order and method the Claimants will pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e of ar|gument in their Reply, from that adopted in the An&s;wer to their claim&mdash;For if the doctrine, (to them &s;o &s;trange) "<HI>that no legal impediments to the recovery of their debts exi&s;ted in Virginia &s;ince the peace</HI>" be really well founded, every other di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will be vain and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>This claim <HI>was</HI> intended "<HI>to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the Board mo&s;t of the principles relative to the debts within the State of Virginia,</HI> of which payment may be claimed, under the treaty of 1794, from the trea&s;ury of the United States." In order to bring the&s;e forward with as much expedition, and at as &s;mall expence and trouble as po&s;&s;ible, the claimants at large, were advi&s;ed by their General Agent to &s;elect that li&s;t of balances which contained the fewe&s;t names, and to cla&s;s the &s;everal debtors agreeably to a form pre&s;cribed.&mdash;It was not thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the li&s;t &s;o &s;elected &s;hould contain at lea&s;t one ca&s;e under every different head of impediment, e&s;pecially as a claim on account of a trea&s;ury payment had been filed, and in part argued before the Board&mdash; The li&s;t &s;elected, does embrace nearly every other ca&s;e upon which a que&s;tion of impor|tance can ari&s;e. It was therefore expected, and if the claimants are correct in their recollection, it was agreed, that every point &s;hould be argued, in order, that after the long delay which had unfortunately tho' unavoidably taken place, as many principles as po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould be &s;ettled by a decree in a &s;ingle claim, which would enable other claimants &s;o to prepare their different memorials, that all their tenable demands might be arranged under their proper heads, and the cla&s;s or cla&s;&s;es which might be determined untenable, abandoned or omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034906_0110_0FFF9428F26C2460">The form in which the An&s;wer in this ca&s;e appears, and the direction that the re|plication have equal publicity, mu&s;t be the apology for a repetition in many in&s;tances of, in&s;tead of a reference to, the arguments in other ca&s;es&mdash;the An&s;wer does not appear to demand very much new matter in the Reply.</P>
<P>The claimants would not have thought it altogether ju&s;tifiable, for them, in rea&s;oning upon the plain words of a written in&s;trument, to draw inferences from the corre&s;pon|dence or conver&s;ation of mini&s;ters, in order to extend or narrow down the evident and natural meaning of tho&s;e words,&mdash;a mode of argument however which has been adopt|ed in one ca&s;e on one &s;ide, may be pur&s;ued in other ca&s;es on the other &s;ide&mdash;and as the example has been given, it will be followed.&mdash;Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Mr. Ham|mond has al&s;o been cited with much approbation, in the An&s;wer on behalf of the United States to this claim; in that letter the opinions of members of the two Briti&s;h Hou&s;es of Parliament are quoted, to &s;hew the idea that nation entertained of the effect of <HI>recommendations of Congre&s;s.</HI>&mdash;In this Reply the opinions of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous mem|bers of &s;everal deliberative bodies in the United States will be re&s;orted to, to &s;how the ideas Americans entertained of <HI>impediments</HI>&mdash;Deci&s;ions in Engli&s;h courts have been re|lied upon in the An&s;wer&mdash;Deci&s;ions in American courts will be brought forward in the Reply.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, "<HI>that no legal impediments to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, contracted be|fore, exi&s;ted after, the peace, in the State of Virginia</HI>; and, if &s;ome laws of that State bore the complexion of impediments, they were <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> repealed by the treaty.</P>
<P>In order to form a true judgment upon the&s;e po&s;itions, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine into the powers of Congre&s;s previous to the articles of confederation; the authorities ve&s;ted in them by that in&s;trument, and whether they ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means of en|forcing obedience to re&s;olutions, decrees, ordinances or compacts, pa&s;&s;ed or entered in|to by them, within the undoubted limits of that authority!</P>
<P><Q>The powers of Congre&s;s were revolutionary in their nature, ari&s;ing out of events, adequate to every national emergency, and co-exten&s;ive with the object to be at|tained. Congre&s;s was the general, &s;upreme, and controuling council of the nation, the centre of union, the centre of force, and the &s;un of the political &s;y&s;tem. To de|termine what their powers were, we mu&s;t enquire what powers they exerci&s;ed. Con|gre&s;s rai&s;ed armies, fitted out a navy, and pre&s;cribed rules for their government: Congre&s;s conducted all military operations both by land and &s;ea: Congre&s;s emitted bills of credit, received, and &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors, and made treaties: Congre&s;s com|mi&s;&s;ioned privateers to crui&s;e again&s;t the enemy, directed what ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be lia|ble to capture, and pre&s;cribed rules for the di&s;tribution of prizes. Tho&s;e <HI>high acts of &s;overeignty were &s;ubmitted to, acquie&s;ced in, and approved of, by the people of A|merica.</HI> In Congre&s;s were ve&s;ted, <HI>becau&s;e by Congre&s;s were exerci&s;ed with the approba|tion of the people,</HI> the rights and powers of war and peace. In every government, whether it con&s;i&s;t of many &s;tates, or of few, or whether it be of a federal or con&s;oli|dated nature, there mu&s;t be a &s;upreme power or will; the rights of war and peace are component parts of this &s;upremacy, and incidental thereto is the que&s;tion of prize. &mdash;The que&s;tion of prize grows out of the nature of the thing. If it be a&s;ked, in whom, during our revolution war, was lodged, and by whom was exerci&s;ed this &s;u|preme authority? No one will he&s;itate for an an&s;wer. It was lodged in and exerci|&s;ed by Congre&s;s; it was there or no where; the States individually did not, and with &s;afety could not, exerci&s;e it. Di&s;a&s;trous would have been the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, if the &s;tates, &s;eperately, had exerci&s;ed the powers of war. For in &s;uch ca&s;e, there would have been as many &s;upreme wills as there were States, and as many wars as there were wills.

The truth is, that the States individually were not known nor recognized as &s;overeign by foreign nations, nor are they now? the States collectively, under Congre&s;s as the connecting point, or head, were acknowledged by foreign powers as &s;overeign, particularly in that acceptation of the term, which is applicable to all great national concerns, and in the exerci&s;e of which, other &s;ove|reigns would be more immediately intere&s;ted; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as the rights of war and peace, of making treaties, and &s;ending and receiving Amba&s;&s;adors.

<P>The following brief &s;tate of the ca&s;e in which the above opinion was delivered, is abridged from the Judge's &s;tatement:</P>
<P>On the 25th Nov. 1775, Congre&s;s (1 journ. 259) pa&s;&s;ed a &s;eries of re&s;olutions re&s;pecting captures, and recommended it to the different colonies, to erect courts for the trial of &s;uch as &s;hould be made, re&s;erving in all ca&s;es an appeal to Congre&s;s, or &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hould appoint for the trial of appeals.</P>
<P>On the 23d of March, 1776, they re&s;olved, that the inhabitants of the Colonies be per|mitted to fit out armed ve&s;&s;els to crui&s;e on the enemies of the United Colonies, and a few days after, they agreed upon the form of a commi&s;&s;ion to the commanders of private &s;hips of war, which was to run in the name of the Delegates of the United Colonies, and be &s;igned by the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 3d July, 1776, New-Hamp&s;hire pa&s;&s;ed an act for the trial of captures, and allowed in certain ca&s;es an appeal to Congre&s;s, and in others to the Superior Court of the State.</P>
<P>On the 30th of Jan. 1777, Congre&s;s appointed a &s;tanding Committee of Appeals.</P>
<P>In October, 1777, the brigantine Su&s;anna was captured by an armed ve&s;&s;el belonging to Penhallow and others, citizens of New-Hamp&s;hire&mdash;&s;he was libelled in the Maritime Court of New-Hamp&s;hire, and a claim filed on behalf of Doane and others, citizens of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts&mdash;On the 16th of December, 1777, &s;he was condemned&mdash;An appeal to Con|gre&s;s was in due time demanded and refu&s;ed, <HI>becau&s;e contrary to a law of the State</HI>&mdash;An appeal was then pray'd by the claimants to the Superior Court of New-Hamp&s;hire and allowed&mdash;and in September, 1778, a judgment of condemnation was al&s;o rendered in that court&mdash;The claimants in due time demanded an appeal to Congre&s;s, tender'd &s;e|curity to pro&s;ecute the appeal to effect, and the &s;ame was lodged in Congre&s;s within the proper time after the definitive &s;entence was pronounced.</P>
<P>On the 9th of October, 1778, a petition from Eli&s;ha Doane was read in Congre&s;s, ac|companied with the proceedings in New-Hamp&s;hire, and praying an appeal&mdash;this was referred to the Committee of Appeals (4 journal, 586.)</P>
<P>On the 26th of June, 1779, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Appeal gave their opinion that they had juri&s;diction of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034906_0112_0FFF942F1AF6AA08">By the articles of Confederation dated the 19th of July, 1778, ratified the 1&s;t of March, 1781, Congre&s;s were ve&s;ted with the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and exclu&s;ive power</HI> of e&s;tabli&s;hing courts for finally determining appeals in ca&s;es of capture, and in con&s;equence thereof they did erect &s;uch court, and re&s;olved, that all matters re&s;pecting appeals in ca&s;es of capture then depending before Congre&s;s, or the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Appeals, &s;hould be referred to the newly erected Court of Appeals, to be there adjudged and determined according to law.</P>
<P>In the month of September, 1783, the Court of Appeals, before whom the parties ap|peared by their advocates, did after a full hearing and &s;olemn argument finally adjudge and decree, that the &s;entences of the inferior and &s;uperior courts of New-Hamp&s;hire &s;hould be rever&s;ed, and the property re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Here the cau&s;e re&s;ted till the adoption of the exi&s;ting Con&s;titution of the United States, except an ineffectual &s;truggle before Congre&s;s on the part of New-Hamp&s;hire, and an unavailing experiment at common law, to obtain redre&s;s on the part of the appellants.</P>
<P>From the foregoing &s;tatement, William Cunningham &amp; Co. think, that they are not going too far in &s;aying, that there the cau&s;e would have re&s;ted forever, had it not been for the pre&s;ent judiciary &s;y&s;tem of the United States.&mdash;Fortunately however, that &s;y&s;tem was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the time arrived when theory could be reduced to practice, when imbe|cility was &s;ucceeded by energy, when impartial ju&s;tice could not only pronounce her deci&s;ion, but enforce its execution, and in the year 1795, the repre&s;entative of Doane heard a decree in his favour from the highe&s;t tribunal in America, prefaced with this hone&s;t and correct &s;entiment&mdash;
<Q>Judges may die, and Courts be at an end; but Ju&s;tice &s;till lives, and though &s;he may &s;leep for a while, will eventually awake, and mu&s;t be &s;atisfied.</Q></P>
<P>Another in&s;tance:</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the &s;loop Active, in the Admiralty of Penn&s;ylvania, the jury found a verdict which was confirmed by the Judge, and &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed thereon&mdash;An appeal was lodged and referred by Congre&s;s to the Committee of Appeals&mdash;the Committee rever&s;ed the &s;entence, making a new decree, and ordering proce&s;s out of the Court of Admiralty of Penn&s;ylvania, to carry this their decree into execution.</P>
<P>The Judge of the Court of Admiralty refu&s;ed to carry into execution the decree of the Committee on Appeals, and a&s;&s;igned as the rea&s;on of his refu&s;al, that an <HI>act of the Legi&s;la|ture of the State</HI> has declared, that the finding of a jury &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the facts in all trials in the Court of Admiralty without re-examination or appeal, and that an appeal is permitted only from the decree of the Judge.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s was agitated in Congre&s;s, and it was "Re&s;olved, That Congre&s;s, or &s;uch per&s;ons as they appoint, to bear and determine appeals from the Courts of Admiralty, <HI>have nece&s;&s;arily the power</HI> to examine, as well into deci&s;ions on facts, as deci&s;ions on the law, and to decree finally thereon, and that no finding of a jury in any Court of Ad|miralty, or Court for determining the legality of captures on the high &s;eas, can or ought to de&s;troy the rights of appeal, and the re-examination of the facts re&s;erved to Congre&s;s:</P>
<P>That no act of any one State, can or ought to de&s;troy the right of appeals to Congre&s;s in the &s;en&s;e above declared:</P>
<P>That Congre&s;s is by the&s;e United States inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme &s;overeign power of war and peace:</P>
<P>That the power of executing the law of nations is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;overeign &s;upreme power of war and peace:</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034906_0113_0FFF94309F7B0560">That the legality of all captures on the high &s;eas mu&s;t be determined by the law of nations:</P>
<P>That the authority ultimately and finally to decide on all matters and que&s;tions touching the law of nations, does re&s;ide, and is ve&s;ted in the &s;overeign &s;upreme power of war and peace:</P>
<P>That a controul by appeal is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to compel a ju&s;t and uniform exe|cution of the law of nations:</P>
<P>That the &s;aid controul mu&s;t extend, as well over the deci&s;ions of juries as Judges, in courts for determining the legality of captures on the &s;ea; otherwi&s;e <HI>the juries would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ultimate &s;upreme power of executing the law of nations in all ca&s;es of captures, and might at any time exerci&s;e the &s;ame in &s;uch manner, as to prevent a po&s;&s;ibility of being controuled</HI>; a con&s;truction which involves many inconveniences and ab&s;urdities, de&s;troys an e&s;&s;ential part of the power of war and peace entru&s;ted to Congre&s;s, <HI>and would di&s;able the Congre&s;s of the United States, from giving &s;atisfaction to foreign nations complaining of a violation of neutralities, of treaties or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury in any one State,</HI> to involve the United States in ho&s;tilities; a con&s;truction, which for the&s;e and many other rea&s;ons, is inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That this power of controuling by appeal the &s;everal admiralty juri&s;dictions of the States, has hitherto been exerci&s;ed by Congre&s;s, by the medium of a Committee of their own Members.</P>
<P>That the Committee who determined the appeal from the Admiralty of Penn&s;ylvania was duly con&s;tituted. The Congre&s;s then</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that the &s;aid Committee had competent juri&s;diction to make thereon a final decree, and therefore their decree ought to be carried into execution."</P>
<P>The powers above claimed by Congre&s;s, were mo&s;t ab&s;olutely and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to be ve&s;ted &s;omewhere in confederated Republics, as well as in &s;ingle States and Monar|chies. The &s;upreme power of the confederation was the only place in which they could be lodged. The &s;afety of all the States as well as of each individual State, irre&s;i&s;tibly required it; and the deductions drawn by Congre&s;s from the nece&s;&s;ary and acknowledged po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power, flow too palpably to admit of contradiction. All this the Judge of the Admiralty of Penn&s;ylvania knew, as well as Congre&s;s. But there was a colli&s;io legum. Congre&s;s the &s;upreme power of the whole had re&s;erved the right of deciding on appeals in all ca&s;es of capture: The law of Penn&s;ylvania had declared the finding of a jury to be final. That law was not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of the State. The Judge of the State court was bound by his oath, to decide according to the law of the State: He was not to declare a new law; he was not to determine whether the par|tial appeal was politic or impolitic: He could only &s;ay, this act is my authority; my oath and con&s;cience are my monitors: And this Congre&s;s knew as well as the Judge. What then did Congre&s;s do? Had they the means of enforcing the decree of their committee? Could they compel the inferior to bend to the &s;uperior court? They did all in their power.&mdash;</P>
<P>They re&s;olved,</P>
<P>"That the General A&s;&s;embly of the State of Penn&s;ylvania be reque&s;ted to appoint a committee to confer with a committee of Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of the proceedings relative to the &s;loop Active, and the objections made to the execution of the decree of the Committee on Appeals, to the end that proper mea&s;ures may be adopted for removing the &s;aid ob&s;tacles: And that a committee of three be appointed to hold the &s;aid confer|ence with the committee of the General A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, (5 journals, 86 to 90.)</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania appointed a committee to confer accordingly, and the following re&s;o|lutions pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly as directions to that committee.</P>

<P>Re&s;olved 1&s;t. That "the power of e&s;tabli&s;hing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all ca&s;es of captures". is re&s;erved in Congre&s;s by the articles of Con|federation: And as the State of Penn&s;ylvania has acceded to tho&s;e articles, this hou&s;e e&s;teem it their duty to adopt &s;uch regulations, con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of the Con|federation, as Congre&s;s may judge nece&s;&s;ary for the due exerci&s;e of the &s;aid power.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That by an act of this Commonwealth for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Court of Admiralty, it is declared and enacted, that the finding of the jury &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the facts without re-examination or appeal; and that the &s;aid act is not repugnant to, but con&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s of 25th Nov. 1775.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That the proceedings in the ca&s;e of the &s;loop Active were founded on the afore&s;aid act of A&s;&s;embly, which, together with the &s;aid re&s;olve, form the true ground whereupon the deci&s;ion of the conte&s;ted points &s;hould be made, without involving a con|&s;ideration of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of future alterations or amendments.</P>
<P>It need only be added, that the Legi&s;lature the next year amended their Admiralty law, directed that ca&s;es of capture &s;hould be decided agreeably to the law of nations and acts of Congre&s;s; that the proceedings &s;hould be according to the cour&s;e of the civil law, and an appeal in all ca&s;es given to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>From the foregoing ca&s;es it is evident, that whenever any difference aro&s;e between the Superior Court of Congre&s;s and the Inferior Court of the State, the advantage was on the &s;ide of the State Court; that when in the lower court, a State law came in op|po&s;ition to the act, ordinance, or re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, the latter was obliged to yield to the former: In fine, that although Congre&s;s appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s exten&s;ive powers, they could carry nothing into effect, when oppo&s;ed by the laws and courts of individual States; in theory they had every thing, in practice nothing.</P>
<P>Were the real powers of Congre&s;s increa&s;ed by the adoption of the articles of Confe|deration?&mdash;It is contended their power in making treaties was dimini&s;hed. Congre&s;s had declared the States independent;&mdash;the States individually formed Con&s;titutions for them&s;elves;&mdash;the Con&s;tituted Authority in each State &s;ent their Delegates to Congre&s;s, to con&s;ult and act for the general good;&mdash;thus &s;ent with undefined powers, the only na|tural conclu&s;ion was, that their authority mu&s;t be commen&s;urate to the object of their ap|pointment:&mdash;"He who wills the end, wills al&s;o the means by which that end &s;hould be accompli&s;hed." Under the impre&s;&s;ion of having the fulle&s;t powers for that purpo&s;e, Congre&s;s entered into and ratified treaties with France;&mdash;but this power, is (by the &s;tronge&s;t implication) con&s;idered in a le&s;s exten&s;ive point of view in the articles of Confede|ration. There each State re&s;erves its own &s;overeignty, and every power not expre&s;sly delegated to Congre&s;s; and &s;o far were the States from allowing that Treaties were the Law of the Land, that a clau&s;e was in&s;erted, that
<Q>No State &s;hould lay impo&s;ts or duties to interfere with any &s;tipulations in Treaties, entered into by the United States, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, with any King, Prince, or State, in pur&s;uance of any Treaties already propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s to the Courts of France and Spain:</Q>
And in the 9th article, in which the power of <HI>entering into</HI> Treaties is delegated, the power of e&s;tabli&s;hing rules for deciding in ca&s;es of capture is given, but with this remarkable difference, that all the important rights of foreigners, however &s;ecured by Treaty, all the numerous que&s;tions on the law of nations ari&s;ing out of Treaties, are left to be decided as many different ways as there may be courts; and in many in&s;tances the national faith, character, honor and peace, committed to the general verdicts of uninformed juries, while a di&s;pute about a cock-boat could be carried to a Court of Appeals appointed by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034906_0115_0FFF5FA750AC1CB8">The imperfections of a &s;y&s;tem formed in a time of general commotion, became day by day more vi&s;ible. The public inconveniences ari&s;ing from them were &s;everely felt after the peace; amendments were con&s;tantly called for, and at la&s;t, the voice of the Continent, upon the &s;ubject of the imbecility of the Confederation, became too loud and powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. A Convention was called to amend the article. They found it ea&s;ier to build up a new &s;y&s;tem than patch the old one. A new Form of Go|vernment was agreed upon, and &s;ubmitted to the different States for adoption or rejection.</P>
<P>That valuable in&s;trument had its friends and opponents in all the States. In none was it more &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, or more ably &s;upported than in Virginia; and to no part of it was the oppo&s;ition more pointed, than that which made Treaties the Law of the Land.</P>
<P>The opinions and declarations of &s;ome of the able&s;t characters is the Union on that important occa&s;ion will be quoted, not as authorities to extend or narrow any word in a Compact, but as irre&s;i&s;tible proof of the general &s;entiment of America, re&s;pecting the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Congre&s;s, under the Confederation, and of the infractions of the Treaty of Peace.

to have any force at all, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as re&s;pects individuals, mu&s;t, like all other laws, be a&s;certained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in the&s;e determinations, they ought to be &s;ubmitted in the la&s;t re&s;ort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL: And this tribunal ought to be in&s;tituted under the &s;ame authority which forms the treaties them&s;elves. The&s;e in|gredients are both indi&s;pen&s;ible. If there is in each &s;tate a court of final juri&s;diction, there may be as many different final determinations on the &s;ame point, as there are courts. There are endle&s;s diver&s;ities in the opinions of men. We often &s;ee not only differing courts, but the judges of the &s;ame court differing from each other. To avoid the confu&s;ion which would unavoidably re&s;ult from the contradictory deci&s;ions of a num|ber of independent judicatories, all nations have found it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h one court paramount to the re&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a general &s;uperintendence, and authori&s;ed to &s;ettle and declare in the la&s;t re&s;ort, an uniform rule of civil ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"This is the more nece&s;&s;ary where the frame of the government is &s;o compounded, that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this ca&s;e, if the particular tribunals are inve&s;ted with a right of ultimate juri&s;diction, be&s;ides the contradictions to be expected from difference or opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local regulations. As often as &s;uch an interference was to happen, there would be rea&s;on to apprehend, that the provi&s;ions of the particular laws might be prefered to tho&s;e of the general laws; from the deference with which men in office naturally look up to that au|thority to which they owe their official exi&s;tence. The treaties of the United States, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen different legi&s;la|tures, and as many different courts of final juri&s;diction, acting under the authority of tho&s;e legi&s;latures. The faith, the reputation, the peace of the whole Union, are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the intere&s;ts of every mem|ber of which it is compo&s;ed. Is it po&s;&s;ible that foreign nations can either re&s;pect or con|fide in &s;uch a government? Is it po&s;&s;ible that the people of America will longer con&s;ent to tru&s;t their honour, their happine&s;s, their &s;afety, on &s;o precarious a foundation?"</P>

<P>"If there are &s;uch things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government being co-exten&s;ive with its legi&s;lative, may be ranked among the number.

<P>And again (<HI>ib.</HI> 96.) &s;peaking of the judiciary:</P>
<P>"The judicial power extends to all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, by the United States. I &s;hall not repeat, at this time, what has been &s;aid with regard to the power of the States to make Treaties; it can not be controverted, that when made, they ought to be ob&s;erved. But it is highly proper that this regulation &s;hould be made; for the truth is, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, that in order to prevent the payment of Briti&s;h debts, and from other cau&s;es, our treaties have been violated, and violated too by the expre&s;s laws of &s;everal States in the Union. Penn&s;ylvania, to her honor be it &s;poken, has hitherto done no act of this kind; but it is acknowledged, on all &s;ides, that many States in the Union have infringed the treaty; and it is well known, that when the Mini&s;ter of the United States made a demand of Lord Carmar|then, of a &s;urrender of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, he told the Mini&s;ter, with truth and ju&s;tice, <Q>The treaty, under which you claim tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, has not been performed on your part: Until that is done, tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions will not be delivered up.</Q> This clau&s;e, Sir, will &s;hew the world, that we make the faith of treaties a con&s;titutional part of the character of the United States; that we &s;ecure its performance no longer nominally, for the Judges of the United States will be enabled to carry them into effect, let the le|gi&s;latures of the different States do what they may."</P>
<P>And in another page (131.)</P>
<P>"I &s;tated on a former occa&s;ion one important advantage; by adopting this &s;y&s;tem, we become a nation; at pre&s;ent we are not one. Can we perform a &s;ingle national act? Can we do any thing to procure us dignity, or to pre&s;erve peace and tranquillity? Can we relieve the di&s;tre&s;s of our citizens? Can we provide for their welfare or happi|ne&s;s? The powers of our government are mere &s;ound.

<P><PB N="13" REF="034906_0118_0FFF943D00DFF408">Mr. Maddi&s;on, in the Virginia Convention (1 vol. deb. 140) u&s;es the following &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions:</P>

Our violation of treaties already entered into, proves this truth unequivocally."</P>
<P>Mr. Randolph, (at that time Governor of Virginia, and &s;ince Attorney-General, and afterwards Secretary of State for the United States) in an&s;wer to &s;ome ob&s;ervations of Mr. Henry on the Confederation, &s;ays,</P>
<P>"P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the meeting of the federal convention, &s;ays the honorable gentleman, we re&s;t|ed in peace; a miracle it was, that we were &s;o: Miraculous mu&s;t it appear to tho&s;e who con&s;ider the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the war, and the no le&s;s afflicting calamities, which we &s;uffered in the &s;ucceeding peace;&mdash;be &s;o good as to recollect how we fared under the confederati|on. I am ready to pour forth &s;entiments of the fulle&s;t gratitude to tho&s;e gentlemen who framed that &s;y&s;tem. I believe they had the mo&s;t enlightened heads in this we&s;tern hemi&s;|phere:&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding their intelligence, and earne&s;t &s;olicitude, for the good of their country, this &s;y&s;tem has proved totally inadequate to the purpo&s;e, for which it was devi|&s;ed: But, Sir, this was no di&s;grace to them; the &s;ubject of confederations was then new, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily forming &s;ome government for the States, to defend them a|gain&s;t the pre&s;&s;ing dangers, prevented, perhaps, tho&s;e able State&s;men from making that &s;y&s;tem as perfect as more lei&s;ure and deliberation might have enabled them to do: I can|not otherwi&s;e conceive how they could have formed a &s;y&s;tem, that provided no means of enforcing the powers which were nominally given it. Was it not a political farce, to pretend to ve&s;t powers, without accompanying them with the means of putting them in execution? This want of energy was not a greater &s;oleci&s;m than the blending together, and ve&s;ting in one body, all the branches of Government. The utter inefficacy of this &s;y&s;tem was di&s;covered the moment the danger was over, by the introduction of peace: The accumulated public misfortunes that re&s;ulted from its inefficacy, rendered an altera|tion nece&s;&s;ary; this nece&s;&s;ity was obvious to all America: Attempts have according|ly been made for this purpo&s;e. I have been a witne&s;s to this bu&s;ine&s;s from its earlie&s;t be|ginning. I was honoured with a &s;eat in the &s;mall Convention held at Annapolis. The members of that Convention thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">animou&s;ly, that the controul of commerce &s;hould be given to Congre&s;s, and recommended to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to extend the improvement to the whole &s;y&s;tem. The members of the general Convention were particularly deputed to me|liorate the confederation. On a thorough contemplation of the &s;ubject, they found it impo&s;&s;ible to amend that &s;y&s;tem: What was to be done? The dangers of America, which will be &s;hewn at another time by a particular enumeration, &s;ugge&s;ted the expedient of forming a new plan: The confederation has done a great deal for us, we all allow, but it was the danger of a powerful enemy, and the &s;pirit of America, Sir, and not a|ny energy in that &s;y&s;tem that carried us through that perilous war: For what were its be&s;t arms? The greate&s;t exertions were made, when the danger was mo&s;t imminent. This &s;y&s;tem was not &s;igned till March 1781, Maryland having not acceded to it before: yet the military atchievements and other exertions of America, previous to that period, were as brilliant, effectual, and &s;ucce&s;sful, as they could have been under the mo&s;t energie Go|vernment. This clearly &s;hews, that our perilous &s;ituation was the cement of our Union &mdash;How different the &s;cene when this peril vani&s;hed, and peace was re&s;tored! The de|mands of Congre&s;s were treated with neglect. One State complained that another had not paid its quotas as well as it&s;elf. Public credit gone&mdash;for I believe were it not for the private credit of individuals we &s;hould have been ruined long before that time. Commerce langui&s;hing&mdash;produce falling in value, and ju&s;tice trampled under foot.

<P>The &s;ame Gentleman, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed acquainted with the laws of Virginia and the practice of its courts, and who cannot be &s;u&s;pected of a public &s;lander upon his na|tive State, &s;ays, "The cry of peace is fal&s;e. It is but a &s;udden calm; the tempe&s;t growls over you&mdash;look round&mdash;where&s;oever you look you &s;ee danger. When there are &s;o many witne&s;&s;es in many parts of America, that Ju&s;tice is &s;uffocated, &s;hall peace and happine&s;s &s;till be &s;aid to reign? Candour, Sir, requires an undi&s;gui&s;ed repre&s;entation of our &s;ituation. Candour demands a faithful expo&s;ition of facts. Many <HI>citizens</HI> have found Ju&s;tice &s;trangled and trampled under foot, through the cour&s;e of juri&s;prudence in this country. Are tho&s;e who have debts due to them, &s;atisfied with your government? Are not creditors wearied with the procra&s;tination of your legal proce&s;s? A proce&s;s ob|&s;cured by legi&s;lative mi&s;ts."</P>
<P>If the above remarks are founded, (and the Claimants do not ob&s;erve that they were contradicted,) if even citizens were thus impeded in the recovery of their ju&s;t debts, what mu&s;t have been the &s;ituation of Briti&s;h creditors?</P>
<P>Again, the &s;ame &s;peaker &s;ays, (1 vol. deb. 84) "The debts due to the Briti&s;h are al&s;o very con&s;iderable. The&s;e have been withheld contrary to treaty." And in reply to Mr. Henry, who had an&s;wered him, he &s;ays, (p. 190) "The honorable gentleman has pa&s;t by my ob&s;ervations with re&s;pect to Briti&s;h debts. He has thought proper to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. My ob&s;ervations mu&s;t, therefore, have full force." The Claimants do not conceive that any member could contradict the a&s;&s;ertion. The in&s;trument then under con&s;ideration was dated Sept. 17, 1787. The act of Virginia of Dec. 12, 1787, and its &s;u&s;pending clau&s;e, was only &s;ix months old, and mu&s;t have been too fre&s;h in the memory of every one pre&s;ent, to admit of a contradiction.</P>
<P>Mr. Pendleton, the pre&s;ident of the Convention, &s;ays, "It was the &s;pirit of Ame|rica, and not the Confederation, that carried us thro' the war. Thus I prove it; the moment of peace &s;hewed the imbecility of the Federal Government. Congre&s;s were em|powered to make war and peace. A peace they made, giving us the great object, In|dependence, and yielding us a territory that exceeded my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. Unfortunately, a &s;ingle <HI>di&s;agreeable clau&s;e,</HI> not the object of the war, has retarded the performance of the treaty on our part. <HI>Congre&s;s could only recommend its performance, not enforce it.</HI>"</P>
<P>Mr. Nicholas, in urging the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting the Con&s;titution, &s;ays, (Deb. vol. 2, p. 43) "There is another point wherein this government will &s;et them right; I mean the We&s;tern Po&s;ts. They have been withheld from us &s;ince the peace by the Briti&s;h. The violation of the treaty on our part, authori&s;es this detention in &s;ome degree. The an&s;wer of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter to our demand of &s;urrendering the Po&s;ts, was, that as &s;oon as America &s;hould &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to comply with the treaty on her part, that Great Britain &s;hould do the &s;ame. By this Con&s;titution, treaties will be the &s;upreme law of the land."</P>
<P>If other proof was wanting, in addition to the&s;e &s;trong and uncontradicted acknowledg|ments, Congre&s;s have repeatedly declared their &s;entiments on the &s;ubject. It was in vain they a&s;&s;erted, that "a treaty made and publi&s;hed by them became obligatory on the whole nation." The a&s;&s;ertion was a dead letter. They had no power to inflict penal|ties on infractions; no courts to carry their decrees into execution: It was in vain they recommended repeals of exi&s;ting laws infringing the treaty; the days of common danger were over; the tali&s;man that had once en&s;ured re&s;pect to their ordinances, had lo&s;t its virtue, and their recommendations &s;ounded as feebly in the &s;outh, as the voice of Ju&s;tice in the ears of a di&s;hone&s;t and protected debtor.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034906_0120_0FFF9443002790E8">The rea&s;oning of the Author of the Federali&s;t is &s;o conclu&s;ive that the Claimants mu&s;t beg leave to adopt it as their own.</P>
<P>"The ca&s;e of Virginia is &s;till &s;tronger than that of South Carolina. There is e|vidence which cannot be di&s;puted, that her courts, in defiance of the treaty, have con|&s;tantly remained &s;hut to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, in virtue of laws pa&s;&s;ed during the War.</P>
<P>"An act of her general a&s;&s;embly of the 22d. June, 1784, after &s;ugge&s;ting as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain the carrying off of the Negroes, and the detention of the po&s;ts, after in&s;tructing her delegates in Congre&s;s to reque&s;t a remon&s;trance to the Briti&s;h court, complaining of tho&s;e infractions, and de&s;iring reparation, and after declaring that the national honour and intere&s;t of the citizens of that Commonwealth, obliged the a&s;|&s;embly to withhold their co-operation in the compleat fulfilment of the &s;aid treaty, until the &s;ucce&s;s of the aforementioned remon&s;trance is known, or Congre&s;s &s;hall &s;ignify their &s;entiments touching the premi&s;es, concludes with the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>"That &s;o &s;oon as reparation is made for the foregoing infraction, or congre&s;s &s;hall judge it indi&s;putably nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch acts and parts of acts pa&s;&s;ed during the late war, as inhibit the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, ought to be repealed, and payment thereof made in &s;uch time and manner, as &s;hall con&s;i&s;t with the exhau&s;ted &s;ituation of the common|wealth.</P>
<P>"The plain language of this re&s;olution is, that there were acts pa&s;&s;ed during the war, which then actually inhibited the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, and that for the removal of this inhibition, a repealing act by the authority of Virginia was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"However unfounded this po&s;ition might have been in theory, here is conclu&s;ive evi|dence that the fact in Virginia was conformable to it; that her courts had been, ever &s;ince the peace, then were, and until a repealing law was pa&s;&s;ed, were likely to continue to be &s;hut again&s;t the recovery of Briti&s;h debts.&mdash;When te&s;timony of this kind was urged by the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, was it po&s;&s;ible for our Envoy to make any &s;olid reply; Who could be &s;uppo&s;ed to know better than the legi&s;lature of Virginia, the real &s;tate of the fact? When that legi&s;lature declared it to be as has been &s;tated, who, or what could contradict it? With what truth has it been a&s;&s;erted, that "it was at all times perfectly under&s;tood" that treaties controuled the laws of the States?</P>
<P>"Additional proof of the contrary is found in the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, the State pa&s;&s;ed an act, repealing all &s;uch acts or parts of acts of the State, as had prevented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this provi&s;o, that there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the repeal, 'till the Governor, by advice of council, had, by proclamation, notified that Great-Britain had delivered up the po&s;ts, and was taking mea&s;ures for the further fulfilment of the treaty by delivering up the negroes, or by making compen&s;ation for them. This denotes clearly, that in the opinion of the legi&s;|lature of Virginia, there were acts of that State which had prevented, and might pre|vent, the recovery of debts according to the treaty.</P>
<P>"It is ob&s;ervable too, that the re&s;olutions of June, 1784, do not even give the expectation of a complete repeal of the impeding laws, in the event of reparation of the breaches of treaty by Great-Britain. They only promi&s;e &s;uch a modification of them as would permit the payment in &s;uch time and manner as &s;hould con&s;i&s;t with the exhau&s;ted &s;itu|ation of the Commonwealth; that is, not according to the true intent of the treaty, but according to the opinion of the legi&s;lature of Virginia of the abilities of the Com|monwealth.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="034906_0121_0FFF944484189580">"The complaints of a power, who&s;e treaty with us was, in fact, violated by the ope|ration of a State law, could never be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered by referring to a theo|retic ab&s;tract, or di&s;puted propo&s;ition. Such a power might reply with irre&s;i&s;tible force: "It is not for us to concern our&s;elves about the &s;tructure and meaning of your political con&s;titutions, or the force of legal maxims deducible from the forms and di&s;tri|butions of power which you have adopted for your government.

<P>But it is &s;aid that the legi&s;lature of Virginia did not know what their own laws were, or in other words, that the &s;u&s;pending clau&s;e in the act of 12th December, 1777, acknowledging the exi&s;tence of impediments, and refu&s;ing to repeal the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, "<HI>pa&s;&s;ed un|der an erroneous opinion</HI> that impediments did exi&s;t, and that this opinion was generally prevalent, as much <HI>becau&s;e the creditors did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> venture to bring forward their claim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, from an idea of a general prejudice again&s;t them before a court of ju&s;tice, as for any other rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned.</HI>" If the members were in the habit of attending the courts of their re&s;pective counties, they would find good rea&s;ons for their opinion. This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which the Claimants have ever heard the ignorance of a legi&s;lature u&s;ed as an argument to do away an unequivocal declaration in a &s;tatute. If, indeed, the laws regulating elections in Virginia, contained a prohibition &s;imilar to that in the writs for the Coventry Parliament, then the name of <HI>Parliamentum indoctum,</HI> and the ob&s;erva|tion of Sir Edward Coke, "that they never made a good law," might be applied to the Virginia A&s;&s;embly of 1787. If any member of that hou&s;e &s;ub&s;cribes to the a&s;&s;ertion in the An&s;wer, the Claimants will refer him to the only reported ca&s;e they know, in which, and the terms on which, ignorance of the law was admitted as an excu&s;e.</P>
<P>"In the year 1598, Sir E. Coke, then Attorney-General, married the Lady Hatton, without banns or licence, and in a private hou&s;e, &s;everal great men were pre&s;ent, as Lord Burleigh, &amp;c.&mdash;they all &s;ubmitted to the cen&s;ure of the Arch-Bi&s;hop, who granted them ab&s;olution from the excommunication they had incurred.

<P>The Claimants in this ca&s;e &s;incerely repent, that they were as ignorant of the laws of Virginia as the law-makers them&s;elves are &s;tated to be, in the an&s;wer to their claim; and they tru&s;t their ignorance will be their excu&s;e.</P>
<P>But even &s;uppo&s;ing there were legal impediments in Virginia, and that the legi&s;lature of that State were not in an error when they pa&s;&s;ed the act of 1787, "it is contended that the treaty of peace abrogated all the legi&s;lative acts of Virginia, which were con|trary to it: In this light it was generally con&s;idered throughout the United States; and it is not believed, that any judicial deci&s;ion was ever made to the contrary, by the Judges of any court, in any State: And if, <HI>by accident,</HI> &s;uch a deci&s;ion was ever made, it may be pronounced to be erroneous, and would have been corrected, if it had been carried before a higher tribunal."

<P>It is conceived, that enough has already been &s;aid to afford a &s;atisfactory reply to this part of the an&s;wer: A very few ob&s;ervations more will be made.</P>

The Claimants al&s;o admit, that there can be no doubt whatever, but that by the law of nations, and general equity, every particular State (where there are many which compo&s;e one whole) is bound to perform the contract or peace-treaty entered into at a Congre&s;s of the repre&s;entatives of tho&s;e States, which form the whole; and that &s;uch treaty mu&s;t ope|rate as a tie upon each State, <HI>to re&s;cind all acts and ordinances whatever made during the war, which contravent the terms of the treaty.</HI> But they contend, and the Congre&s;s of the United States have admitted, that &s;ome act of each particular State (repealing any act or ordinance which might impede the operation of the treaty, and giving power to the &s;tated Judges of each State to pronounce judgment notwith&s;tanding &s;uch act or ordi|nance in conformity to the treaty) would be nece&s;&s;ary to warrant the Judges of each State to act in conformity to the treaty.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted (An&s;wer, pa. 51) that the treaty was generally con&s;idered throughout the United States as the law of the land and to be obeyed and executed accordingly; it is acknowledged (pa. 43) that a contrary opinion was generally prevalent in Virginia, and even adopted and acted upon by the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in the An&s;wer (pa. 51.) that "it is not believed that any judicial deci&s;ion was ever made to the contrary by the judges of any Court in any State, and if <HI>by acci|dent</HI> &s;uch deci&s;ion was ever made, it may be pronounced erroneous." One out of many &s;hall encumber this reply&mdash;others will be produced to the Board in proper time.</P>

<P>"On this day came the parties by their Attornies, and upon hearing the arguments that were offered by the &s;aid Attornies, and all matters of law ari&s;ing thereupon, the Court are of opinion that this &s;uit be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it appearing to the <HI>Court to be a Briti&s;h Debt.</HI>"</P>
<P>The foregoing is duly certified under the County Seal&mdash;The deci&s;ion does not appear from the record to have been made by <HI>accident,</HI> but upon deliberation and hearing argu|ments of Council.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="034906_0123_0FFF9448794525E8">The record of the ca&s;e of Clerk, Admr. of Ru&s;&s;el <HI>v</HI> Harwood, in Maryland, has been before the Board as a document in another Claim. A repetition of a few ob&s;ervations upon that deci&s;ion, may be proper here. The effect of a payment of a debt due to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject into the trea&s;ury of Maryland, was the &s;ame, as a &s;imilar payment in Virginia. By the laws of each State it operated as a di&s;charge of the debt. It is fair to rea&s;on from what did pa&s;s in Maryland, who&s;e courts were open immediately after the peace, to what would have pa&s;&s;ed in Virginia, had &s;he barely repealed all laws prevent|ing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects from pro&s;ecuting &s;uits for the recovery of their debts, without going further and <HI>declaring the Treaty of peace the &s;upreme law of the land.</HI></P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Ru&s;&s;ell's Admr. <HI>v</HI> Harwood,</P>
<P>The original Writ i&s;&s;ued 19th. June 1786&mdash;Several pleas were put in, but all of them were afterwards relinqui&s;h'd, except that of payment unto the trea&s;ury agreeably to the act of A&s;&s;embly, and judgment was rendered in favour of the Plaintiff by the Judges of the General Court, deducting war intere&s;t, on the 12th of October 1790. A writ of Er|ror was &s;ued out the 21&s;t. December 1790, and the judgment of the General Court was rever&s;ed in the high court of errors and appeals, June the 9th. 1795.</P>
<P>The Claimants do not pretend, nor have they, or any other Claimants before the Board, ever pretended, that the decree of the court of appeals <HI>in this Ca&s;e</HI> can be &s;up|ported on legal principles&mdash;The judgment of the general court was rendered after the trea|ty had been declared the law of the land, by the Legi&s;lature of Maryland, and after it had been <HI>&s;olemnly e&s;tabli&s;hed as the &s;upreme law of the land,</HI> by the adoption of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States&mdash;It however e&s;tabli&s;hes undeniably the&s;e points&mdash;That the act authori&s;ing payments into the trea&s;ury of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and pay|ments made in conformity to the directions of that act, were in the opinion of the high|e&s;t court of Maryland, a bar to the recovery of the debt, and notwith&s;tanding the fede|ral Con&s;titution, would &s;till be a bar, if an appeal had not been authori&s;ed in the "act to e&s;tabli&s;h the judicial courts of the United States."</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts al&s;o an impediment which that act it&s;elf cannot remove, and which would entitle the Admini&s;trator of Ru&s;&s;el to claim compen&s;ation of the United States, if Har|wood had became in&s;olvent even &s;ub&s;equent to the 9th. of June, 1795. The bail in er|ror, was bail for the ab&s;olute payment of the debt, if the court of appeals of Maryland affirmed the judgment. By the rever&s;al of the judgment of the General Court that bail was di&s;charged. Another con&s;equence is undeniable. If this &s;uit had been brought earli|er, and if the final judgment of the court of appeals in Maryland had been rendered be|fore the 24th. of September, 1789, the date of the "act to e&s;tabli&s;h the judicial courts of the United States," the Creditor would have been without remedy, except under the 6th Article of the Treaty of Amity,&mdash;And if all the Creditors in Virginia had commen|ced their &s;uits immediately after the peace, and every one had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, on the ground that they were for Briti&s;h debts, no courts erected &s;ub&s;equent to tho&s;e judgments, and under a con&s;titution adopted &s;ub&s;equent to them, could po&s;&s;ibly re-examine and rever&s;e them.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid that the deci&s;ion of the circuit Court of the United States in June, 1796, fully e&s;tabli&s;hes the doctrine, that a treaty controuls all State laws oppo&s;ed to it. Could a &s;imilar deci&s;ion of the Judges of the Supreme court of Virginia &s;ince the peace and before the adoption of the federal Con&s;titution, be produced, it might be of con&s;equence, but it lies not with the United States to &s;ay, "It is true that in 1783, we &s;tipulated, that no legal impediments &s;hould exi&s;t to the recovery of debts, the courts in the different States ought to have decided that that &s;tipulation repealed the laws which the Judges of tho&s;e courts were &s;worn to &s;upport; We recommended it to them &s;o to do; Their ob&s;tinacy would not, or their con&s;ciences could not, bend to our recommendati|ons. It is true, that many lo&s;&s;es have been &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence thereof: It is true
<PB N="19" REF="034906_0124_0FFF944A577C1D90">
that in 1794, we promi&s;ed compen&s;ation for tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es; but we are relea&s;ed from both &s;tipulations, becau&s;e, in 1796, the Judges of our Circuit Court have decided that judgments of State Courts, (not in our power to rever&s;e,) were rendered on erroneous principles."</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e cited (Hamilton <HI>v</HI> Eaton) does not go the full length contended for in the An&s;wer. The principle there laid down is correct where there is one &s;overeign will; but it has been &s;hewn, that it is at be&s;t extremely doubtful where there is <HI>imperium in imperio</HI>; nor was it nece&s;&s;ary to decide the point, for the Chief Ju&s;tice goes on and &s;ays, "If, however, a &s;ub&s;equent &s;anction of this State was at all nece&s;&s;ary to make the treaty law here, it has been had and repeated. By a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in 1787, the treaty was de|clared to be law in this State, &amp;c. And in 1789, was adopted here, the Con&s;titution of the United States, which declared, that all treaties made, or to be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hould be the &s;upreme law of the land, and that the Judges in every State &s;hould be bound thereby; any thing in the Con&s;titution or laws of the State to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. Surely then, <HI>the treaty is now law in this State.</HI>" He concludes with &s;aying, "What is mo&s;t material to be here noted is, that the right or ob&s;tacle in que&s;tion, whatever it may amount to, has been created <HI>by law, and not by the creditors:</HI> It comes within the de&s;cription of <HI>lawful impediments,</HI> all of which, in this ca&s;e, the treaty, as I apprehend, <HI>removes.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Claimants leave the general points on legal impediments, with this remark, that if the power of the State legi&s;lature of North Carolina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;hort &s;tatement of facts attending the above ca&s;e may be nece&s;&s;ary. Archibald Hamilton, and Co. had mercantile hou&s;es in Gla&s;gow; they had large &s;tores in North Carolina and in Virginia; the American concerns of the hou&s;e for &s;everal years previous to the Revolution, had been under the direction of John Hamilton, E&s;quire. In April 1777, the legi&s;lature of North Carolina enacted, that all per&s;ons who had traded directly to Great Britain or Ireland, within ten years la&s;t pa&s;t, &s;hould take an oath of alle|giance or depart the State; they were authori&s;ed to &s;ell their e&s;tates, to export the amount in produce, and to appoint attornies to &s;ell and di&s;po&s;e of their e&s;tates for their u&s;e. Debts were not mentioned, nor were they required to collect them before their departure. That was impracticable, as no courts exi&s;ted. Under the above act the plaintiffs left North Carolina. In November, 1777, another act pa&s;&s;ed, confi&s;cating all their e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal; and Commi&s;&s;ioners were directed to be appointed to collect all their debts for the u&s;e of the State, and give di&s;charges, which &s;hould forever indemnify the debtor. Under this act very large &s;ums were paid, among others the debt of the defendant. After the peace, Col. Hamilton return|ed to North Carolina to endeavour to collect his debts, but a po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive law of the State prohibited him from in&s;tituting any &s;uit. Several &s;uits were commenced again&s;t him for &s;ums owing to citizens of Virginia and North Carolina, and judgments &s;peedily obtained for principal and intere&s;t. In this &s;ituation he petitioned the legi&s;lature to repeal the confi&s;cation law, and grant an order on the trea&s;ury for the monies paid in by his debtors; this was rejected. He petitioned a &s;econd time, &s;tating the &s;uits brought again&s;t him, and praying the equal benefit of the laws to recover the debts due to him, and reque&s;ting an order for only &s;o much of the money paid into the trea&s;ury by his debtors, as would enable him to di&s;charge the debts due by the firm before the war to citizens of America. This, al&s;o, was rejected; and as the federal judiciary was now e&s;tabli&s;hed, in which &s;uits for 500 dollars and upwards could be commenced, and &s;ome were, they or|dered the Attorney and Solicitor General to defend them.</NOTE>, had not been controuled by the Con&s;titution of the United States; or if the 14th amendment to that Con&s;titution agreed to by the Virginia Convention,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By an amendment propo&s;ed by the Virginia Convention, the judicial power of the United States was not to extend to any ca&s;e, where the cau&s;e of action originated before the ratification of the Con&s;ti|tution, except di&s;putes between States about their territory, di&s;putes between per&s;ons claiming lands under grants of different States and &s;uits for debts due to the United States.</NOTE> had been adopted, it is probable the ca&s;es of Hamilton <HI>v</HI> Eaton, or Jones <HI>v</HI> Hylton, would have never been decided.</P>

<HEAD>The Claimants are to prove their Ca&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is admitted, but it is contended that in this ca&s;e, as well as in &s;uits at law, a title prima facia good, is &s;ufficient until the defendant &s;hews, either that the plaintiff has been dive&s;ted of that title, or that the defendant, or &s;ome per&s;on el&s;e, has a better; or, if it is a demand for money, that the demand has been legally &s;atisfied. But there are ca&s;es even at law where the fulle&s;t proof cannot be expected; and here a legal maxim applies: "No man is permitted to take advantage of a defect of evidence, when that defect is occa&s;ioned by his own act."</P>
<P>A maxim is cited in the An&s;wer, (p. 5) <HI>Melior e&s;t conditio defendentis</HI>&mdash;This requires an ob&s;ervation. "<HI>Potior e&s;t conditio po&s;&s;identis,</HI>" is a correct maxim. In an ejectment the plaintiff mu&s;t produce a clear title, otherwi&s;e the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the defendant is &s;ufficient. The maxim cited in the an&s;wer &s;hould be, "<HI>In pari delictu melior e&s;t conditio defendentis.</HI>" This is founded on a principle of general policy, which a defendant has advantage of, contrary to real ju&s;tice, as between him and the plaintiff; the principle is, "<HI>ex dolo malo non oritur actio.</HI>" If the cau&s;e of action appears to ari&s;e <HI>ex turpi c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;a,</HI> or a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a po&s;itive law, there the court &s;ays, the plaintiff has no right to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted; it is not for the &s;ake of the <HI>defendant,</HI> but becau&s;e they will not lend their aid to &s;uch a <HI>plaintiff,</HI> (Cowper 343.) In reply to this maxim, a claimant can only a&s;k, in the "plaintive motto of a Courtnay, <HI>Ubi lap&s;us? quid feci.</HI>"</P>
<P>It is agreed, that the &s;tipulation in the Sixth article of the treaty of Amity is &s;o "<HI>brief and intelligible, that it is difficult by any phra&s;eology to make it either more conci&s;e or plain.</HI>" (An&s;w. pa. 7.) But the Claimants do not entirely acceed to the &s;pecial de&s;cripti|on in the An&s;wer. (pa. 8.) within which it is &s;aid, a "remediable claim mu&s;t be brought;" nor to all the ca&s;es (pa. 10.11.) &s;aid to be "<HI>not relievable under the trea|ty.</HI>" They fully agree with the An&s;wer in this, "<HI>that the</HI> 6<HI>th. article of the treaty of amity grew out of the</HI> 4<HI>th. article of the treaty of peace</HI>" but while they acknowledge the fundamental principle laid down, (pa. 12.)
<Q>that no lo&s;s or damage is reparable under the treaty of <HI>1794,</HI> that is not grounded on a debt comprehended in the <HI>4</HI>th article of the treaty of <HI>1783,</HI> and has not proceeded from the violation or non-execution thereof,</Q>
to be cor|rect as far as it goes, they re&s;pectfully contend, that the fundamental rule &s;hould be in the affirmative, and not the negative; it &s;hould be&mdash;<HI>Every lo&s;s or damage is reparable under the treaty of</HI> 1794, <HI>that is grounded on a Debt comprehended in the</HI> 4<HI>th article of the treaty of peace, and has proceeded from a violation or non-execution thereof.</HI></P>
<P>This leads to a &s;hort di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as to the true meaning of both articles. The Claimants will &s;tate the con&s;truction which to them appears to ari&s;e from the Words&mdash;The Board will decide between the an&s;wer and reply.</P>
<P>"<HI>It is agreed, that Creditors on either &s;ide, &s;hall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in &s;terling Money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</HI>"</P>
<P>The words <HI>Creditors on either &s;ide,</HI> are to be taken in their mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ignification. All Briti&s;h &s;ubjects having demands on one &s;ide, whether re&s;ident in Great Britain, Ireland, the Indies, or the Continent; and all American citizens on the other. All

di&s;tinctions of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects taken from their re&s;idence, are blended in the de&s;ignation <HI>Creditors on the &s;ide of His Britannic Maje&s;ty.</HI> Not a word is &s;aid of <HI>Debtors</HI>; therefore, the fir&s;t de&s;cription in the An&s;wer (pa. 8) is not quite accurate; for, if a Briti&s;h &s;ubject indebted to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject before the peace, had ab&s;conded with his property, after the peace, and becoming either a citizen or inhabitant of any State, had there been protected by a State law from the pur&s;uit of his creditor, it is not unfair to &s;up|po&s;e it a remediable claim. That, however, is not the ca&s;e of the Claimants, nor is it known or believed that any &s;uch ca&s;e exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Further. "<HI>Creditors of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted,</HI>" whether entitled to receive the debts, as creditors by original contract or a&s;&s;ignment before the peace: Whether the debts had been confi&s;cated, &s;eque&s;tered, paid into the Trea&s;ury, or tendered in worthle&s;s paper, or in any thing le&s;s than &s;terling value: Whether the obligations or evidences of the debts had been &s;eized, de&s;troyed and cancelled, as in &s;everal ca&s;es they were, under a State law; or fraudulently or forcibly, or by operation of law, obtained by the debtor&mdash;Still they are creditors, and are to meet no lawful impediment to the <HI>recovery</HI> of the full value in &s;terling money <HI>of all &s;uch debts.</HI></P>
<P>A law that is univer&s;ally beneficial cannot contain exceptions, for &s;uch would make it only beneficial in ca&s;es not excepted. The word <HI>all,</HI> without any exception annexed to it, is a term of univer&s;ality, and cannot be re&s;trained, there being no ambiguity in the expre&s;&s;ion, and as to the words <HI>lawful impediments to the recovery,</HI> they have nothing to operate upon, e&s;pecially as connected with the words <HI>full value in &s;terling money,</HI> except confi&s;cations, &s;eque&s;trations, depreciated paper, depreciation laws, &s;caleing debts, and laws at that time in force prohibiting &s;uits; all of which required legi&s;lative interference to remove; in every other ca&s;e, by the mere return of peace, without any expre&s;s &s;tipu|lation, the war &s;u&s;pended remedy revived. The article therefore clearly means, that tho&s;e laws, and all proceedings under them, &s;hould be <HI>no impediment to a full recovery.</HI> A rule of con&s;truction of &s;tatutes, already mentioned, is "to give its force to every word, where it can be done." And Vattel &s;ays, "<HI>where an act is conceived in clear and pre|ci&s;e terms, when the &s;en&s;e is manife&s;t and leads to nothing ab&s;urd, there can be no rea&s;on to refu&s;e the &s;en&s;e which it naturally pre&s;ents,&mdash;to go el&s;ewhere in &s;earch of conjectures to extin|gui&s;h or re&s;train it, is to endeavour to elude it.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the treaties made between France, Spain, and Holland, with Great Britain, about the &s;ame time, there is no &s;uch provi&s;ion; becau&s;e there exi&s;ted no &s;uch acts in tho&s;e governments, which rendered nece&s;&s;ary a &s;tipulation that their effects &s;hould be of no validity.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice, and reciprocal remedies to the &s;ubjects and citizens of the two countries, call for this con&s;truction. The intimate connection which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great Bri|tain and the Colonies, previous to their &s;eparation, &s;trongly require it, in order to make the article completely mutual. No laws were made in England confi&s;cating debts, or making depreciated paper a tender; and if a creditor was beyond &s;eas, no act of limi|tation barred him. If, therefore, le&s;s than <HI>all</HI> impediments to the recovery of <HI>all</HI> debts were intended to be removed, where is the line to be drawn?&mdash;An half, a fiftieth, or a thou&s;andth part? Or, is a con&s;truction to be put, &s;imilar to that &s;tated and &s;everely re|probated by Puffendorf, on the treaty between Fabius Labeo and Antiochus. in which the Romans &s;tipulated to re&s;tore one half the &s;hips taken from Antiochus. They &s;awed them all in half, and rendered the whole u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth article of the treaty of amity which aro&s;e out of the foregoing article of the treaty of peace, in con&s;equence of alledged infractions, evidently contains, and mu&s;t be divided into two parts. Great Britain complained, "that debts to a con&s;iderable amount, which were bona fide contracted before the peace, &s;till remain owing to her &s;ub|jects, by citizens or inhabitants of the United States; that by the operation of various

<P>Within this part of the &s;ection, and this only, the Claimants mu&s;t prove their ca&s;e. They come fairly before the Board on the following terms:</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Their Debtors mu&s;t have been citizens or inhabitants of the United States.</P>
<P>Their debts mu&s;t have been bona fide contracted before the peace; they are to be proved in that manner which was admi&s;&s;ible and &s;ufficient, at the time they were con|tracted, if that is now po&s;&s;ible; but, if from the unavoidable accidents that mu&s;t have happened in a long lap&s;e of time, that is now impracticable, the next be&s;t te&s;timony in their power is to be received and con&s;idered. Their debts mu&s;t &s;till remain owing to them; legal impediments mu&s;t have &s;o operated, that <HI>a full recovery has been delayed,</HI> or the value and &s;ecurity impaired and le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that by the <HI>ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceed|ings</HI> (that is, the courts which had original juri&s;diction, according to the amount in the State where the debt was contracted,&mdash;for the pro&s;ecution of a five pound appeal, &s;even hundred miles off, was never contemplated) they cannot NOW <HI>actually have and receive full and adequate compen&s;ation</HI> for the lo&s;&s;es and damages thereby &s;u&s;tained. No further or other points are to be proved, and if they cannot <HI>now</HI> actually have and receive from their Debtor, they are not to wait the event of hopele&s;s &s;uits or general verdicts, years after the commi&s;&s;ion &s;hall have been expended; becau&s;e, the United States <HI>have agreed,</HI> that in all &s;uch ca&s;es where full compen&s;ation cannot, <HI>for whatever rea&s;on,</HI> be actually ob|tained, they will make it.</P>
<P>While the Claimants &s;tate the above to be all that can be required of them, and in&s;i&s;t that it is &s;ufficient to entitle them to a decree, (they executing proper a&s;&s;igmnents and relea&s;es) for all lo&s;&s;es and damages thus proved to be &s;u&s;tained, if nothing el&s;e appears; They admit, that there is a defendant &s;ide to the ca&s;e, becau&s;e, when the United States &s;tipulated to make compen&s;ation as above, they required, and it was agreed, and "di&s;tinctly under&s;tood, that the &s;tipulation was not to extend to lo&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned <HI>by &s;uch in&s;olvency of the debtors, as would equally have operated to produce &s;uch lo&s;s if the &s;aid impe|diments had not exi&s;ted,</HI> nor to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es or damages as have been occa&s;ioned by the ma|nife&s;t delay, negligence, or wilful omi&s;&s;ion of the Claimant."</P>
<P>This part of the article belongs to the United States, and when the in&s;olvency of the debtor at and ever &s;ince the peace is affirmed, the burthen of the proof lies on the par|ty affirming. If an executor or admini&s;trator pleads no a&s;&s;ets, or fully admini&s;ter'd, it is incumbent upon him to &s;hew that nothing was in his hands, or how he has admini&s;ter'd. So where omi&s;&s;ion or negligence is alledged.</P>
<P>If the foregoing view of the article is correct, &s;hort replies will be &s;ufficient to many ob&s;ervations contained in the An&s;wer.</P>

while debtors are tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s publicly, buying, &s;elling, and trading, they are at that time good and &s;olvent debtors; and the State of Virginia by protecting their debtors from a &s;uit, was like the holder of a bill of exchange giving credit at his own ri&s;k to an acceptor.</P>
<P>If all tho&s;e debts had been a&s;&s;igned to the United States at the peace for valuable con|&s;ideration, with a&s;&s;urances to refund &s;uch part as, with due diligence could not be reco|vered by rea&s;on of in&s;olvency, and Virginia one of the United States created, or permited impediments to exi&s;t for &s;everal years, which were at la&s;t removed, but the debtor became in&s;olvent before a &s;uit can be pro&s;ecuted to judgment,&mdash;The remedy over is lo&s;t unle&s;s clear proof can be brought of actual in&s;olvency at the time of the a&s;&s;ignment. So where the payee of a bill neglects to give due notice of the non-acceptance, he will lo&s;e his re|medy again&s;t the drawer, on the principle, that if due notice had been given, the draw|er <HI>might have &s;ecured him&s;elf</HI>; this defence however of the drawer will not avail him, if it is &s;ufficiently proved that he had no funds in the hands of the drawee. It mu&s;t there|fore be evident, that if, in the ca&s;e of an a&s;&s;ignment as above &s;tated, the United States could not recover of the Claimants, without proof of in&s;olvency at the peace, (which is equivalent to proof of no funds in the hands of a drawee) &s;o neither can they re&s;i&s;t their promi&s;e to make full compen&s;ation, without that proof.</P>
<P>But the rever&s;e of the allegation is true. The creditors were driven out of the State by law. The courts were occluded in 1774. At the return of peace, &s;uits were pro|hibited. If therefore, there is a defect of proof on this point, it ari&s;es from the act of the State, and not to be taken advantage of. Where pre&s;ent in&s;olvency, or removal from the State during the exi&s;tence of legal impediments, are the grounds on which com|pen&s;ation is claimed, they will be proved.</P>
<P>It is laid down as a <HI>general rule,</HI> "that the creditor ought to apply to the Courts of Ju&s;tice again&s;t the debtor, before he applies to the Commi&s;&s;ioner's again&s;t the United States." (An&s;w. pa. 10.)</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances the debtors have &s;old off their property during the period of exi&s;ting impediments, and removed to places beyond the reach or knowledge of the claimants; it cannot be expected that records of &s;uits &s;hall be produced in &s;uch ca&s;es. To &s;ue per&s;ons notoriou&s;ly in&s;olvent, only to produce a return of "no goods," is to &s;uppo&s;e the Commi&s;|&s;ioners can receive no te&s;timony of facts, but what ari&s;es from record.&mdash;If one &s;uch re|turn was had, it might be alledged, that the claimants had only tried one county;&mdash;that the debtor might have goods in another of the eighty-two counties, he mu&s;t be pur&s;ued in each; if the returns are uniform, it may be urged that he has lands; the claimants mu&s;t try their elegits, and at la&s;t after twenty years delay, and expence equal to fifty times the debt, they will be able to e&s;tabli&s;h by records what the board can ea&s;ily decide upon te&s;ti|mony le&s;s expen&s;ive, more ea&s;ily obtained, and equally &s;atisfactory.&mdash;To bring &s;uits in ca|&s;es where there is no other te&s;timony except the books, or even where there is other proof, if length of time is a bar, would only be adding the co&s;ts of ten thou&s;and fruitle&s;s &s;uits to the lo&s;s and damage already &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;e &s;tated (An&s;w. pa. 10, 11) as not relievable, is admitted; &s;o is the &s;e|cond, on proof by the United States of the debtors in&s;olvency at the peace, and at all times &s;ince: The third and fourth are conte&s;ted, for rea&s;ons already given; and be|cau&s;e mo&s;t of the debts are below the juri&s;diction of the Circuit Court of the United States. It would take years to carry tho&s;e which are above the final juri&s;diction of the inferior court, up to the "highe&s;t court of law or equity of the State in which a deci&s;ion can be had;" in order to bring them within the appellate juri&s;diction of the Supreme Court of the United States; and becau&s;e the word <HI>now,</HI> in the &s;ixth article, does not mean ten years after the Board &s;hall have broken up.</P>

Where the debt has been <HI>&s;atisfactorily &s;ettled before</HI> the peace, there was no debt <HI>at the peace</HI>; where ever it has been <HI>&s;o &s;ettled</HI> &s;ince the peace, there is no debt now owing; where it was voluntarily compromi&s;ed by a new contract before the peace, and the performance of that contract has been prevented by legal impediments &s;ince, that is &s;trictly within the treaty; where it has been <HI>voluntarily</HI> compromi&s;ed by a new contract &s;ince the peace, the original demand is extingui&s;hed, and it is not within the treaty. In making the&s;e admi&s;&s;ions, the Claimants under&s;tand the words voluntarily and &s;atisfactorily in their plain &s;en&s;e&mdash;the will mu&s;t have been unfettered by the certainty that <HI>compromi&s;e</HI> was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e payment could not be enforced; and the &s;ettlement mu&s;t have been &s;uch, as would have been &s;atisfactory, if acce&s;s to the courts had not been denied, and the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice had been unimpeded. A ca&s;e may ari&s;e, where a debtor in affluent circum|&s;tances, or the heirs of &s;uch debtor, paid the debt into the trea&s;ury of Virginia, and took a receipt, which by law was declared an effectual di&s;charge from the debt: The e&s;tate of the decea&s;ed has pa&s;&s;ed unincumbered into the hands of bona fide purcha&s;ers: The heirs, in the enjoyment of the per&s;onal and the purcha&s;e money of the real e&s;tate are, on the return of peace, applied to by the creditor: Their an&s;wer is rigorous, but mixt with hone&s;ty, and a regard for character: Your debt (&s;ay they) has been paid according to a law in force: By law we are di&s;charged&mdash;by law you cannot recover: It is true, that the money paid into the trea&s;ury was worth nothing&mdash;it is true, you have received no &s;atisfaction, and in con&s;cience and ju&s;tice you are entitled to it; make us certain deductions, give us certain terms of in&s;talment, accept our &s;eparate engage|ments according to the proportions of e&s;tate which have re&s;pectively de&s;cended to us, and we will give them; but you mu&s;t take this or nothing. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the credi|tor complying was doing the be&s;t in his power for him&s;elf, and of cour&s;e the be&s;t in his power for the United States. But can this be called a <HI>voluntary compromi&s;e,</HI> a <HI>&s;atisfac|tory &s;ettlement?</HI> And if one of tho&s;e heirs became in&s;olvent before payment could be en|forced, can negligence or omi&s;&s;ion be imputed to the creditor, or will it be fair in the United States to &s;ay, "<HI>We did &s;tipulate that no impediments &s;hould exi&s;t, but we are di&s;|charged from that agreement, becau&s;e the creditor has been compelled to &s;ubmit to impediments which actually did exi&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>The &s;eventh excepted ca&s;e is admitted, provided the indulgence was granted &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal court, and the &s;um was within its juri&s;diction; but it is ho|ped that no endeavours of a claimant to per&s;uade a debtor to do ju&s;tice, no kind expo&s;tu|lations in letters &s;oliciting payment, or even part payments, at a time when no payment which could not be enforced by law, will be con&s;trued into &s;uch indulgence, and in in|&s;tances where the Attorney for the creditor was a relation of the debtor, it might have been hoped, that tho&s;e expo&s;tulations would have had more weight then when pro|ceeding from a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The eighth excepted ca&s;e in the An&s;wer, is by no means agreed to. Judgments of competent courts before the war, are undoubtedly a bar to any claim, on account of a debt then determined not to be ju&s;t; but if non-&s;uits have been ordered, &s;uits di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, or judgments rendered for defendants during the commotions at <HI>the commencement of the war,</HI> and in the ab&s;ence of the plaintiff, it will require more con&s;ideration before claims on that account are abandoned. The different Claimants have been advi&s;ed by their General Agent not to bring forward any very &s;tale claims; but it is by no means ad|mitted, that a debt, which had been five years due, at the time of the occlu&s;ion of the courts in Virginia, was not a <HI>bona fide debt</HI> within the meaning of the treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="034906_0130_0FFF945B5686B170">The Claimants acknowledge, if the courts in Virginia had been open to them at the ratification of the treaty of peace, and all the time between their occlu&s;ion and that ra|tification had been declared out of the act of limitations, in that ca&s;e they would have had no right to complain. If length of time had then been pleaded, they might have repelled the plea by proof of &s;ub&s;equent acknowledgments and promi&s;es, <HI>which is not now within their power.</HI></P>
<P>Here &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the book debt law, the act of limitations, the deci&s;ions of courts, and the practice of the bar in Virginia under tho&s;e acts, may be properly in|troduced. Deci&s;ions nearly coeval with the date of a &s;tatute, and particularly where an uniform practice conformably to &s;uch deci&s;ions has taken place for a length of years, are of &s;uch high authority as not to be &s;haken; "<HI>Contemporanea expo&s;itio e&s;t forti&s;&s;ima in lege,</HI>" they re&s;train, they enlarge the con&s;truction, and &s;ometimes &s;ettle a con&s;truc|tion contrary to the letter.</P>
<P>Before the enacting of the act of 1748, the &s;tore books of the merchant had always been admitted as evidence of the debt, and an act (5 Geo. IId. now out of print) of the &s;ame title as the act of 1748, was in force; and it is believed no complaints ever were heard either again&s;t the practice or the law. But as the &s;tate of &s;ociety advan|ced, debtors &s;ometimes di&s;puted the accounts, which threatened de&s;truction to that mu|tual confidence which had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the merchant and the planter, and which was e&s;&s;ential to the convenience of the inhabitants. However, the exigencies of the people, who were moneyle&s;s a great part of the year ab&s;olutely requiring it, (for otherwi&s;e, they could not without the mo&s;t intolerable inconvenience to them&s;elves have procured the comforts and nece&s;&s;aries which their families daily &s;tood in need of,) the le|gi&s;lature, <HI>at once to comply with the public convenience, and to &s;ecure the merchant,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the "<HI>act pre&s;cribing the method for proving book debts.</HI>"</P>
<P>After the pa&s;&s;ing of this law, (which the claimants never under&s;tood to have been con|&s;idered as a <HI>grievance to the planters)</HI> the cour&s;e of trade was continued upon the ancient footing, and the planters per&s;i&s;ted to take up goods, as they had occa&s;ion for them for the u&s;e of their families, and to pay for them out of the en&s;uing crop. It frequently hap|pened though, that they over went the growing crop and anticipated the &s;ub&s;equent one: In which ca&s;es, if the exce&s;s was not great in proportion to the u&s;ual extent of their crops, it was cu&s;tomary once a year to call over the accounts in pre&s;ence of the debtor, to fur|ni&s;h him with a copy if de&s;ired; and to transfer the balance to another ledger, without demanding a &s;pecialty, which would have been con&s;idered as a mark of di&s;tru&s;t, and therefore would have been highly offen&s;ive, in&s;omuch that it was never done, except in ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be perilous, in order to give dignity to the debt. Nor is there any in|&s;tance recollected where &s;uch transfer of the balance has ever been made, until the ac|count was approved of by the debtor. The courts fell in with this di&s;po&s;ition of the par|ties, and took the law by equity; which they extended beyond the &s;trictne&s;s of the let|ter to ca&s;es which hardly &s;eemed to be within the provi&s;ions of it.</P>
<P>Thus, although the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ections relate to accounts for &s;tore dealings and tran&s;actions altogether, yet accounts between planters, or for mechanic work, or upon a|ny other account what&s;oever, were proved in the &s;ame way, and judgment given on them.</P>
<P>So, although the law &s;peaks of two and three years, yet the County Courts univer&s;ally di&s;pen&s;ed with the limitations, and allowed the evidence at any di&s;tance of time. Hence it came to pa&s;s, that nothing ever prevented a recovery of an open account thus authen|ticated, but the general act of limitations pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1705; which, at that time, was thought &s;o di&s;graceful, that lawyers never in&s;i&s;ted on it without directions, and no per&s;on of reputation would require it to be pleaded; and whoever did was held in &s;uch di&s;honour that very few in&s;tances of it ever occurred; and even in tho&s;e, juries found for the defendant with &s;uch reluctance, that any thing was admitted in avoidence of the
<PB N="26" REF="034906_0131_0FFF945DE26CA710">
plea. In the General Court too, which at that time was the highe&s;t Court of Judicature in the State &s;uch evidence was admitted, where not pointedly objected to; and the ob|jection either from the integrity of the bar, or the di&s;countenance &s;hewn by the Court, was &s;eldom made, in&s;omuch that it is believed, that but few ca&s;es happened where the plain|tiff failed to recover merely upon the ground of that objection. Nay, &s;uch was the encou|ragement given by the Courts to this &s;pecies of evidence, that in ca&s;es where the plain|tiffs &s;ummoned his clerks or others to prove the account, payment for the witne&s;&s;es atten|dance was di&s;allowed by the Court, as the plaintiff might have proved it by his own oath and therefore &s;hould not have &s;ummoned the witne&s;s and unnece&s;&s;arily have encrea&s;ed the co&s;ts of the &s;uit again&s;t the defendant.</P>
<P>This conduct generated a mutual confidence between the merchants and their cu&s;to|mers, which induced candour in the planter, and a &s;trict attention on the part of the merchant to the fairne&s;s of his accounts; in&s;omuch that he would have yielded any debt which was pointedly objected to by the cu&s;tomer, &s;ooner than have the reputation of his books impeached. And to &s;uch length was this carried, that a wilful fal&s;e entry in his books would have been as highly condemned, not only by cu&s;tomers, but by mer|chants, as if he had committed forgery; becau&s;e &s;uch practices would, in the long run, have weakened the te&s;timony, which, while it remained unimpaired, was held as &s;acred as a bond. Hence, in the public e&s;timation, few evidences were more re&s;pected than a merchant's books, and none, where it was more e&s;&s;entially the intere&s;t of the party that they &s;hould be pure and unexceptionable.</P>
<P>Under this act, therefore, prior to the revolution, the merchants and traders of all de|nominations re&s;ted perfectly &s;ecure, and &s;eldom thought of procuring any other te&s;ti|mony, except where the claim had grown to any con&s;iderable amount, or all dealings and tran&s;actions were broken off betwixt the parties, when bonds were &s;ometimes taken to give dignity to the debt. The planter confided in the books, and the merchant relied on them as the only evidence of his claim, which he tru&s;ted would be always &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport it; and a&s;&s;ured of this, from the whole experience of his bu&s;ine&s;s, he gave him&s;elf no concern about any other. Which &s;ecurity was not indi&s;creet, but was founded on the practice and deci&s;ions of the country.</P>
<P>From this temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the parties, and the &s;ecurity which the law and practice of the country afforded the creditor, &s;uits were &s;eldom brought, unle&s;s the delay of payment was uncon&s;cionable, or the debtor was declining in his circum&s;tances: In which ca&s;es they were brought, not to authentica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the debt, for that was con&s;idered as e&s;tabli&s;hed without, but merely to enforce payment of the money.</P>
<P>The revolution then, and its con&s;equent regulations, came upon them by &s;urpri&s;e. It was an event which no human wi&s;dom could have fore&s;een, and therefore could not be provided again&s;t. But even had it been fore&s;een, and had the creditors re&s;olved to guard again&s;t it, they mu&s;t have relied upon the genero&s;ity and integrity of the debtors, as it was not in their power to compel them, from the twelfth day of April, 1774, to this very time. For the co&s;ts of &s;uit in Virginia were a&s;certained by a temporary law called the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Bill, which expired upon the 12th day of April, 1774, and was not revived again until the impediments already mentioned in the memorial, began to exi&s;t. Hence, in a variety of in&s;tances, the creditor <HI>could not have brought his &s;uit, had he deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o, within the limitations pre&s;cribed by the act of A&s;&s;embly</HI>; which being an impediment ari&s;ing from a defect of ju&s;tice in the country, the delay of &s;uit ought not to be imputed to the creditor, even had it been fore&s;een that &s;uch a &s;tep was important. But when it is con&s;idered, that no &s;agacity could have penetrated into the events which afterwards took place, every &s;hadow of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indi&s;cretion imme|diately di&s;appears.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="034906_0132_0FFF945FEFA10228">In this &s;ituation were things then at the commencement of the revolution, which brought on an occlu&s;ion of the courts of ju&s;tice, paper money, and a thou&s;and other ob|&s;tructions, until finally a law was pa&s;&s;ed which obliged the creditors, their factors and agents, to depart the country. So that it became impo&s;&s;ible, by this additional act of government, even had they divined the nece&s;&s;ity of it, to obtain further proofs of their debts, which they could not &s;ue for and reduce into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;1&s;t. Becau&s;e there was an occlu&s;ion of the courts of ju&s;tice&mdash;2d. Becau&s;e there was an expre&s;s inhibition to pro|ceedings in &s;uits brought by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects&mdash;3d. Becau&s;e the creditor could only have recovered paper money, which would have been of no &s;ervice to him out of America; and here he was not allowed to u&s;e or employ it.</P>
<P>Hence if no alteration had been made in the law, it would not have been a chimerical inference in the creditors, that they would on the return of peace, have been allowed to prove their debts according to the exi&s;ting modes at the time they were contracted. But flattering as this pro&s;pect was, it was afterwards bla&s;ted for ever; for, in the year 1779, the book-debt law was repealed; and although the repealing act has an excep|tion with regard to goods &s;old before, yet the Courts immediately began to depart from the liberality of the former practice, and held the plaintiff to the &s;trict letter of the book-debt law, in all ca&s;es previous to the operation of the repealing &s;tatute, and called on him for common law proof in all ca&s;es &s;ub&s;equent to that &s;tatute. So that it is now univer&s;ally holden in all ca&s;es before the State courts, that neither citizen or foreigner can e&s;tabli&s;h his claim by his own oath; and at a late court of the United States for the middle circuit and di&s;trict of Virginia, it was expre&s;sly decided, that the plaintiff could not recover in a &s;uit brought by him upon an open account which was only proved by his own oath, but that the delivery of the articles to the debtor mu&s;t be proved by di&s;|intere&s;ted te&s;timony. Added to this, in the State court on whom alone the deci&s;ion of all cau&s;es under five hundred dollars is devolved, and of the&s;e particularly the county courts, who have concurrent juri&s;diction in all common plea ca&s;es what&s;oever, and ex|clu&s;ive juri&s;diction in all ca&s;es under one hundred dollars, the difficulty would be greater &s;till: For even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;es &s;upported by other evidence, the plaintiffs, &s;ometimes from the ob&s;tinacy of the juries, and at other times from the reluctance of the courts, have been continually delayed, or their claims have been decided again&s;t them without regard to the merits of the ca&s;e, merely on the ground of their being Briti&s;h debts.</P>
<P>Hence it has become morally certain, that no recovery can be had of the debtor for the&s;e claims, becau&s;e the law having been held to be out of force which allowed the plaintiffs to prove them by their own oaths, and the factors, agents, and &s;tore-keepers who might in &s;ome in&s;tances have been able to have proved them having been driven out of the State; and being now dead, or di&s;per&s;ed into different quarters of the world unknown, in much the greater part of the ca&s;es, to the creditors, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prove them according to the common law rules in a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The claimants re&s;pectfully contend, that a change of the rules of evidence after the debts were contracted, ought not to affect the creditor, who only provided him&s;elf with &s;uch evidence as the then exi&s;ting laws and u&s;ages required, and as it was not nece&s;&s;ary for them to have witne&s;&s;es at that time it ought not now to be required; otherwi&s;e the treaty will have done nothing for them, &s;ince although the right to recover is acknow|ledged, yet the means are taken away by requiring te&s;timony not fore&s;een, and impo&s;&s;ible to be procured.</P>
<P>The ninth ca&s;e &s;tated in the An&s;wer (pa. 12.) as not relievable under the treaty, would not have been much conte&s;ted if it had re&s;ted at the fir&s;t period; but the in&s;tance given in the latter part is &s;o contradictory to what the claimants conceive to be an undeniable maxim, to wit "neither of the contracting powers has a right to interpret the treaty at his plea&s;ure," and would go to the entire cutting up of &s;o large a portion of the claims which were intended to be compen&s;ated, that the admi&s;&s;ion would be making the greater
<PB N="28" REF="034906_0133_0FFF9461C0449698">
part of the treaty a dead letter. It is al&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with another part of the An&s;wer it|&s;elf. In one ca&s;e it is in&s;i&s;ted, that the creditors mu&s;t re&s;ort in all ca&s;es to the tribunals of the country, where they can only obtain a partial relief, before they can come before the Board for that part which cannot be recovered; and here it is in&s;i&s;ted, that when they have re&s;orted to that tribunal, and obtained a verdict for that part of their demand which a jury may plea&s;e to allow, they are to be concluded by the verdict, as to the amount, and can never be permitted to &s;hew, that inju&s;tice has been done to them. In other words it is &s;aying, that the courts and juries in Virginia, and in ca&s;es of general verdicts <HI>juries alone,</HI> the friends and neighbours of the debtor, with every prejudice, if not re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the creditor, are to be the exclu&s;ive judges on the con&s;truction of the treaty of peace, that their ideas of equity and ju&s;tice is to be binding on the con&s;ciences of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and that if Judges, <HI>on a plea of payment to a bond,</HI> will admit evidence of the ab&s;ence of the creditor, though forced from the country by law, <HI>as a &s;et-off,</HI> that the Briti&s;h &s;ubject mu&s;t in all ca&s;es &s;ubmit to it; this (to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions of Congre&s;s already quoted, &s;ee pa. 8. <HI>anti.</HI>) "is a con&s;truction which involves many inconveniences and ab&s;urdi|ties, de&s;troys an e&s;&s;ential part of the power of war and peace entru&s;ted to Congre&s;s, <HI>and would di&s;able the Congre&s;s of the United States, from giving &s;atisfaction to foreign nations complain|ing of a violation of neutralities, of treaties, or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury in any one State,</HI> to involve the United States in ho&s;tilities; a con|&s;truction, which for the&s;e and many other rea&s;ons, is inadmi&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>An in&s;tance in which the verdicts of juries has been peculiarly injurious to Briti&s;h creditors, ari&s;es from an act &s;ettling a &s;cale of depreciation. It is true, that the &s;che|dules of debts due at the Brun&s;wick &s;tore, contain no demand on this account; but the Claimants &s;tated in their memorial, that they had &s;everal &s;tores, and it was agreed that as many heads of real complaints as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be brought forward for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in one claim. Under this agreement, and referring to it, the Agent of the United States omitted an&s;wering &s;everal points in the ca&s;e of <HI>O&s;wald Denni&s;town, &amp; Co.</HI> to &s;ave repetition before the Board.</P>
<P>The whole of the debts due to the Claimants were contracted at a time of un&s;u&s;|pecting confidence; when debtor and creditor were &s;ubjects of the &s;ame Sovereign, and bound by the &s;ame laws, under the faith of which the credit was given. No depreci|ation of money was then known. In the year 1777, per&s;ons of their de&s;cription were ordered, by proclamation, to quit Virginia in forty days. To collect their debts in that &s;hort &s;pace was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;they did what they could. From as many of their debtors as they met, who were willing to give, they obtained bonds for the balances due to them. In 1781, a law is pa&s;&s;ed, by which the &s;ums are directed to be reduced to two thirds of the debt bona fide contracted, and war intere&s;t deducted from that two thirds: Is this <HI>equity and ju&s;tice? Is this full compen&s;ation?</HI> Courts and juries may think &s;o, or be bound to decide &s;o in the United States, but debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are not to be legi&s;lated away, by acts to which they were no party. (Du Co&s;ta <HI>v</HI> Cole, Skinner, 272) And as &s;uch judgments are no compliance with the 4th article of the treaty of peace, the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by means of them are to be redre&s;&s;ed under the 6th article of the treaty of amity.</P>
<P>But it is alledged (An&s;w. pa. 41.) "that by judicial deci&s;ions it has been &s;ettled in Virginia, that if a bond dated at any time between the 1&s;t day of January 1777, and 1&s;t day of January 1782, contains in the condition, or any part of it, any thing to &s;hew the debt was originally contracted before the date of the bond, the depreciation law &s;hall not be con&s;trued to operate on &s;uch a ca&s;e; but if the bond has no &s;uch intrin&s;ic evidence of the time the debt was contracted, it is is liable to be &s;caled, and parole evidence is not admitted to alter the effect and purport of the &s;ealed in&s;trument. <HI>Thus then, if the creditor omitted to take a bond &s;o as to &s;hew by &s;omething in it, that it was probably to &s;ecure a debt contracted before the war, it was a wilful omi&s;&s;ion in him,</HI> and if any lo&s;s ari&s;es from hence, it is a lo&s;s not intended by the treaty of 1794, to be charged on the United States."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="034906_0134_0FFF94651BA00198">The only omi&s;&s;ion the Claimants can charge them&s;elves with, is, in not having &s;tated in their memorial, that they are natives of Gla&s;gow <HI>only,</HI> and not from the north; and that there, as in America, the maxim obtains, "<HI>Nemo tenetur divinare.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>Intere&s;t during the War.</HEAD>
<P>Intere&s;t is recoverable upon contracts wherein intere&s;t is &s;tipulated to be paid; upon merchandize according to the u&s;age of particular branches of trade, or of a &s;pecial agree|ment; upon goods &s;old and delivered at a limited credit, after the expiration of the time of credit; upon money payable at a particular day, after that day is pa&s;&s;ed; upon money payable on demand, after demand proved; upon accounts after final &s;ettlement, and even upon accounts where no time of credit was &s;pecified, if the delay has been long, and under vexatious and oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion of intere&s;t will be examined upon general principle, becau&s;e, the occlu|&s;ion of courts prevented a legal demand at one period, the bani&s;hment of the creditors or their factors rendered final &s;ettlements in mo&s;t ca&s;es impo&s;&s;ible, the impediments &s;ince the peace have been vexatious, the deci&s;ions reducing their bonds bearing intere&s;t, have been oppre&s;&s;ive, the lo&s;s upon their accounts for which bonds were not obtained, has been nearly total, and the expence of agents and factors for fourteen years pa&s;t in endea|vouring to collect their debts, has been more than equal to all recovered.</P>
<P>The Claimants do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to go back to the black letter deci&s;ions in the reigns of the Stuarts, to di&s;cover whether <HI>intere&s;t</HI> was recoverable as debt or da|mages; or to find out how judgments were entered, or what pleadings were faulty, a century ago. All the ca&s;es, therefore, cited in the An&s;wer from the 13th to the 20th page, will, (except one) be left as they are. The ca&s;e in a Ventris, 198, is &s;aid in the An&s;wer to be "a judicial re&s;olution upon the very point, whether intere&s;t is reco|verable as debt," and as it was decided upon demurrer, it "<HI>therefore is of high autho|rity.</HI>" The ca&s;e is &s;hortly this. A te&s;tator borrowed a &s;um of money, for which he gave his obligation to repay the &s;ame &s;um with intere&s;t; a judgment was obtained on this obligation again&s;t the executor. Another &s;uit, by another creditor, was afterwards brought again&s;t the executor, to which he pleaded that judgment, in which, the debt and intere&s;t at the time of the action brought, amounted to &s;uch a &s;um, &amp;c. ultra quae he had not to &s;atisfy: Demurrer and judgment for the plaintiff. Lord Hale does make u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ions quoted in the An&s;wer, (pa. 18) but as the real rea&s;on for the judgment is omitted in the An&s;wer, it &s;hall be in&s;erted in the Reply. "<HI>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, that part of the intere&s;t accrued after the te&s;tator's death, which is the</HI> EXECUTOR's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|PER DEBT, <HI>being his own default to &s;uffer the intere&s;t to run on,</HI>" &amp;c.</P>
<P>From the &s;everal ca&s;es cited in the An&s;wer, the following conclu&s;ion is drawn: "If it be an axiom of the Engli&s;h law, as it is believed to be, that an <HI>action of debt</HI> lies for recovering every debt; and if &s;uch an action of debt does not lie for intere&s;t, as has been &s;hewn, then it follows, that in the eye of Engli&s;h law, intere&s;t is not debt."</P>
<P>In the eye of the Engli&s;h law, <HI>intere&s;t is debt</HI>; it is demandable as &s;oon as it be|comes <HI>due</HI> and <HI>payable; it is recoverable</HI> in an <HI>action of debt</HI> brought for <HI>intere&s;t alone,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the ca&s;e in Ventris: For in&s;tance, if a &s;um of money was lent for a num|ber of years with intere&s;t, payable half yearly, the intere&s;t could not be recovered by a&s;&s;ump&s;it in damages for not paying the principal, becau&s;e the principal might not be due. And Lord Kenyon &s;ays, (5 term. R. 556) "<HI>The ca&s;e cited from Ventris ought not to be treated &s;lightly, or overturned without great con&s;ideration, becau&s;e it has the &s;anction of Lord Hale's name. But as at pre&s;ent advi&s;ed, I confe&s;s it appears to me, that the rea&s;ons given in &s;upport of that judgment, are &s;trong to &s;how, that the deci&s;ion &s;hould have been the other way</HI>; for if it were rightly decided in that ca&s;e, that an action of debt will not lie for intere&s;t, great inju&s;tice would be done in a variety of in&s;tances that might be put.
<PB N="30" REF="034906_0135_0FFF94679AA89D90">
If by the terms of the contract, the payment of the money borrowed is to be po&s;tponed to a di&s;tant day, and intere&s;t be re&s;erved and made payable in the mean time, the leader would not, acoording to that doctrine, have any me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of enforcing the payment of the intere&s;t, before the principal can be recovered, and in the in&s;tance put, of the &s;ecurity being by deed, the lender could not recover intere&s;t at all, in a&s;&s;ump&s;it, on ac|count <HI>of the deed.</HI>"</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield &s;ays, (3 Burr. 1375) "The intere&s;t (even upon &s;ums payable by in|&s;talment) is part of the original <HI>debt due upon and &s;ecured by the bond.</HI>"</P>
<P>Lord Hale in the ca&s;e of Ventris, admits, that intere&s;t may be recovered in a&s;&s;ump&s;it, and it is a rule, that wherever <HI>indebit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: a&s;&s;umpfit</HI> will lie, <HI>debt</HI> will al&s;o lie. And la&s;tly, the an&s;wer it&s;elf admits, that intere&s;t &s;ince the peace &s;hould be paid;</P>
<P>Nor is the <HI>maxim</HI> laid down in the An&s;wer, (pa. 19, 20) "that in an action of debt intere&s;t is recoverable for the damage occa&s;ioned by detaining the debt," more cor|rect than the <HI>axiom.</HI></P>
<P>In truth, intere&s;t is recoverable both in Great-Britain and the United States in one or the other of all the following forms.</P>
<P>In actions of debt on bonds with penalty, judgment is rendered for the penalty as the debt, to be relea&s;ed on payment of the principal and intere&s;t due, and if there is a delay of payment beyond the time of judgment, the principal and intere&s;t form a new debt upon which intere&s;t is calculated.</P>
<P>In actions of debt without penalty, intere&s;t is given for detention, and judgment is rendered, (to pre&s;erve old forms,) for &s;o much debt and &s;o much damages.</P>
<P>In actions on the ca&s;e, both principal and intere&s;t are called damages, and judgment rendered for one &s;um including both; and</P>
<P>Intere&s;t is recoverable in an action of debt, by it&s;elf, and in an action of a&s;&s;ump&s;it by it&s;elf, where the principle is not due.</P>
<P>But it is totally immaterial to the Claimants, in what form of action, or by what name intere&s;t is recoverable, or how judgment rolls are made up in different actions; to them it is &s;ufficient, that intere&s;t is <HI>money,</HI> and that it is <HI>due.</HI> In&s;tead therefore of hunting through ob&s;olete ca&s;es for what was the &s;trict meaning of a word, not to be found in the 4th. article of the treaty, to wit, "<HI>intere&s;t,</HI>" the Claimants beg leave to examine into the meaning of a very important word in that article, <HI>debts.</HI></P>
<P>In common parlance <HI>all debts</HI> mu&s;t, and do mean, every &s;um of money a man owes, whether principal or intere&s;t, whether by &s;ealed &s;pecialty, bill, note, book-debt, or pro|mi&s;e expre&s;s or implied; whether recoverable by action of debt, covenant, a&s;&s;umpit, or even ca&s;e for a quantum meruit; or again&s;t a common carrier for the value of goods lo&s;t. If a note bearing intere&s;t is barred by an act of limitation, a promi&s;e to pay the debt will revive the remedy as to principal and intere&s;t. So, directions in a will to pay all the te&s;tator's ju&s;t debts, has been held to revive the remedy for both principal and intere&s;t of debts which had been barred by length of time. It is in this common acceptation that the word was u&s;ed in the treaty. In many in&s;tances, however, of this particular claim, if the &s;trict legal meaning of the word <HI>debt</HI> is adhered to, then the award, even deducting intere&s;t during the war, will far exceed the pre&s;ent demand. On failure of payment agreeably to the condition, the penalty became the debt in every ca&s;e of &s;pe|cialties with penalty;&mdash;The penalty was the debt at the treaty of peace&mdash;The penalty is the &s;um for which an action mu&s;t be brought, and for which the Court are obliged to
<PB N="31" REF="034906_0136_0FFF946A734DF8E0">
render judgement; and (bound down to certain forms of proceeding) nominal damages mu&s;t be given on that penalty, and if from length of time, the principal and intere&s;t exceed the penalty, the overplus intere&s;t is recoverable beyond the penalty. Formerly, Courts of Equity only could relieve again&s;t the penalty; modern &s;tatutes have authorized Common Law Courts to relieve; but how? They render judgement for the penalty&mdash; to be relea&s;ed on payment of <HI>principal and intere&s;t.</HI> Courts rendering judgements on other grounds are a&s;&s;uming Chancery powers not delegated to them.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed, that an accurate report of the ca&s;e of Jones <HI>v</HI> Hylton, had been printed, as well as M'Call <HI>v</HI> Turner. In that cau&s;e Chief Ju&s;tice Jay pre&s;ided, and delivered in the mo&s;t expre&s;s and pointed terms, the opinion of the Court, that full in|tere&s;t &s;hould be recovered. The jury were &s;ent out more than once, but per&s;i&s;ted in the deduction. In the ca&s;e of Hamilton <HI>v</HI> Eaton, the jury of enquiry found a &s;pecial ver|dict, by which the que&s;tion of war intere&s;t was left to the Court, and decided in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance here requires remark. Whenever a Claimant grounds his Claim upon an impediment, created by the judgement of the highe&s;t State Court, the nece&s;&s;i|ty of an appeal to the dernier re&s;ort is in&s;i&s;ted upon. Here, however, the ca&s;e of M'Call <HI>v</HI> Turner is relied upon, in oppo&s;ition to the decided opinion of the Judges who compo&s;e that Superior Court. It belongs not exclu&s;ively to the Courts of either Country to inter|pret treaties. If they differ, no inference but what ari&s;es from the force, the rea&s;on of their arguments, can be drawn. Where the &s;upreme judicial authority of both agree in opinion, that opinion is of the greate&s;t weight.</P>
<P>It has been endeavoured in the An&s;wer, (pa. 14.) to draw an inference from an extract of a letter from the American Commi&s;&s;ioners to Mr. Hartly, dated Pa&s;&s;y, July 17th. 1783, in &s;upport of the po&s;ition, that war intere&s;t &s;hould not be allowed. The Claimant makes no exception to it, but he believes, that if the pre&s;ent was a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion before the highe&s;t Court of Law of Equity, either in Great Britain or the United States, the Jud|ges would not li&s;ten to &s;uch an argument. The an&s;wer would be&mdash;
<Q>We are bound by our oaths to judge upon the words of the in&s;trument, as it is before us&mdash;Our con&s;ciences are not to be guided by the corre&s;pondence of the Mini&s;ters on either &s;ide&mdash;If the Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides were pre&s;ent we could not examine them&mdash;Who ever heard of legi&s;lators be|ing call'd upon to explain the meaning they affix'd to words? <HI>'Tis theirs to legi&s;late, to us belongs the interpretation of their acts.</HI></Q>
As the letter or extract is before the Board it will be ob&s;erved upon, and one undeniable po&s;ition being ceded, it is thought a conclu&s;ion, diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of the Attorney General, will be fairly drawn.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ional articles which were to form the ba&s;is of the definitive treaty of peace were &s;igned the 30th of November, 1782. They laid the foundation of peace and re|conciliation&mdash;They were to be in&s;erted in and con&s;titute the treaty of peace. Whatever therefore was meant by the 4th provi&s;ional article, mu&s;t be the meaning of the 4th arti|cle of the definitive treaty. This is the po&s;ition not to be denied. The&s;e articles were &s;ent over to Congre&s;s: They knew the meaning of the word <HI>debt,</HI> and that it included intere&s;t and principal: Satisfactory as the articles mu&s;t have been, &s;till Congre&s;s wi&s;hed for &s;omething more. From the circum&s;tances of the country at the clo&s;e of the war, they thought it rea&s;onable that time &s;hould be given for payment, and a deduction of intere&s;t agreed to, and in&s;tructed their Mini&s;ters accordingly.</P>
<P>For what purpo&s;e then was the letter of July 17th, 1783, written? To obtain an a|mendment of the article. In what points? In order that in&s;talments might be &s;ettled, and a deduction of intere&s;t agreed to. Was this amendment obtained? No. What is the con&s;equence? That in&s;talment laws and deductions of intere&s;t were a violation of the treaty. To recur to the argument on this point.&mdash;"After this, if war intere&s;t was meant to be claimed on the part of Great Britain, &s;ome unequivocal terms &s;hould have been
<PB N="32" REF="034906_0137_0FFF946C612D0AC0">
u&s;ed, comprehending it; and the not u&s;ing &s;uch terms, is an acquie&s;cence in the opinion entertained by Congre&s;s, which had been communicated by the American negociators of the treaty." Let this inference be contra&s;ted by maxims, and it will at once fall to the ground. If he who can, and ought "to have explained him&s;elf clearly and plainly, has not done it, it is the wor&s;e for him; he can not be allowed to introduce &s;ub&s;equent re|&s;trictions, which he has not expre&s;&s;ed." To this authority from Vattel, the Claimants will add a maxim from a writer equally re&s;pectable: "All contracts are to be taken according to the intent of the parties, expre&s;&s;ed by their own words, and if there be any doubt in the &s;en&s;e of the words, &s;uch interpretation mu&s;t be made, as is mo&s;t &s;trong again&s;t the grantor or obligor, that he may not by ob&s;cure wording of the contract, find means to evade or elude it."</P>
<P>The Claimants believe the 4th article was, as its terms expre&s;s it to be "<HI>reciprocal.</HI>" If the contrary is the ca&s;e, as contended for, the United States are the grantors, the obligors, and for the mo&s;t valuable of all con&s;iderations: Their country was di&s;covered by Britons, peopled by Britons, and during its infancy and weakne&s;s, had been guarded and protected by the blood and trea&s;ure of Britain. It is true, that as the Colonies matured in &s;trength and vigour, they were in a fair way of repaying, by an almo&s;t ex|clu&s;ive commerce, even if they had not actually repaid, the debt of protection. But if at the clo&s;e of a civil war, they demanded and obtained the acknowledgment of their Independence, and the ce&s;&s;ion of an immen&s;e territory unoccupied by citizens of the United States, granted by the Aborigines to the Crown, and in an exten&s;ive line join|ing other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that Crown; and in lieu of this acknowledgment and ce&s;&s;ion, they covenanted, that all debts contracted in a time of mutual confidence, &s;hould be paid, the United States are grantors and obligors for a valuable con&s;ideration, and can not by any &s;ub&s;equent re&s;triction of the meaning of any word in their contract, le&s;&s;en the force of their obligation.</P>
<P>There are &s;tronger objections to any argument being drawn again&s;t the Claimants from Lord Carmarthen's conver&s;ation, than from the Commi&s;&s;ioners corre&s;pondence. Courts of law will not admit parole te&s;timony to contradict a deed; and &s;urely conver&s;ation is not to contradict a treaty. But what is the purport of it? Two years after the negocia|tors of the treaty had fruitle&s;sly endeavoured to have the fourth article amended, &s;o as to admit of in&s;talments and a deduction of intere&s;t, the &s;ame &s;ubject is broached, but the expre&s;&s;ions are widely different, and in both ca&s;es correct.</P>
<P>While the negociation was yet open, and there was a po&s;&s;ibility of an alteration being made, the language is, "Congre&s;s think it rea&s;onable that the <HI>intere&s;t which may have accrued during the war, &s;hall not be payable.</HI> In June, 1786, Mr. Jay urges the policy of <HI>giving up the intere&s;t during the war,</HI> thereby plainly allowing the right to demand it, although the United States may have thought it impolitic and &s;evere to exert that right. Mr. Jay's deci&s;ions as Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States, corroborate this con&s;truction. Lord Carmarthen's ideas of trea&s;on, do not appear extremely correct; and the Clai|mants, yielding in loyalty to none of their fellow-&s;ubjects, would have thought it no crime to have received their debts during the war; but his Lord&s;hip's &s;light expre&s;&s;ions concerning the intere&s;t, and his wi&s;hes that the courts were open for recovering the prin|cipal, were a very mild reproof upon the in&s;talment and other laws infringing the treaty. As to intere&s;t being left to after con&s;ideration, that has been the ca&s;e. In&s;talment laws, deductions of intere&s;t, trea&s;ury payments, and a variety of other impediments, have been the &s;ubject of after negociation and treaty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t clau&s;e only of the &s;ixth article of that treaty, which &s;peaks of <HI>bona fide debts</HI> contracted before the peace, and lo&s;&s;es and damages occa&s;ioned by impediments and in|&s;olvencies, has been in&s;erted in the An&s;wer to the claim of Cunningham and Company. If the article had re&s;ted at the end of the fir&s;t clau&s;e, it might with as much rea&s;on be urged, that no intere&s;t at all &s;hould be allowed&mdash;that when the whole debt was lo&s;t by
<PB N="33" REF="034906_0138_0FFF946F1B246128">
in&s;olvency, the original &s;um due, &s;hould be the full compen&s;ation; and where a partial in&s;olvency happened, the only damage or lo&s;s was to be the difference of the &s;um reco|vered and the original debt. <HI>Debts bona fide contracted</HI> before the peace, and <HI>bona fide debts contracted</HI> before the peace, mean one and the &s;ame thing&mdash;both include intere&s;t, or neither does.</P>
<P>The general tenor of the intere&s;t argument &s;ufficiently accounts for the omi&s;&s;ion of, and total &s;ilence upon, a latter clau&s;e of the 6th article of the treaty of amity, in the An&s;wer to Cunningham's claim: As it contradicts nothing, but &s;upports every thing ad|vanced in this Reply, the &s;ame rea&s;on for &s;ilence does not apply.

<P>The con&s;truction on the 7th article of the treaty of peace formerly contended for, has been abandoned, and the true con&s;truction of the 4th article, has been &s;olemnly &s;ettled by negociation. All que&s;tions on the former being now at re&s;t for ever, it will here be only remarked, that however proper the &s;ubject was for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Hammond in 1792, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for any allu&s;ion to it, either in the deci&s;ion of M'Call <HI>v</HI> Turner, or in the An&s;wer to the memorial of the Claimants. Not the mo&s;t di&s;tant imputation is meant to be made upon the integrity and virtue of the Judges who decided that ca&s;e; but the legality and propriety of the deci&s;ion may be canva&s;&s;ed and denied without a &s;hadow of di&s;re&s;pect to them. The great Lord Hard|wicke, after full argument, and long con&s;ideration, decided an important cau&s;e; ano|ther hearing was afterwards had, and having taken a twelvemonth's time to con&s;ider, he rever&s;ed his own decree, concluding with this ob&s;ervation: "<HI>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons which induced me to alter my opinion, and I am not a&s;hamed of doing it; for I always thought it a much greater reproach to a Judge to continue in his error than retract it.</HI>" Many re|marks might be made upon the deci&s;ion in M'Call <HI>v</HI> Turner, but they will (except one) be avoided. Pre&s;ident Pendleton, after declaring, that intere&s;t during the war ought to be deducted, &s;ays, "<HI>The opinion of the Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States in a ca&s;e (Jones</HI> v <HI>Hylton) before the Federal Court, was cited, in which he is &s;tated to have deli|vered to the jury a charge differing from the opinion I have ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed, but I cannot con|cur with him.</HI>" In the An&s;wer (pa. 38) the ca&s;e of Jones <HI>v</HI> Hylton is mentioned, and this remark is made: "<HI>To this judgment all the Inferior Courts are bound in duty to con|form, and it is believed actually do conform.</HI>" Juries are &s;worn to give verdicts according to their evidence; the opinion of the Court is their evidence what the law of the land is; &mdash;<HI>They di&s;regard it.</HI> Inferior Courts are bound in duty to conform to the judgment of Superior Courts, <HI>but they cannot concur.</HI></P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations in the An&s;wer, (pa. 25 &amp; &s;eq.) do not require reply. <HI>Damages done in war,</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t occurred during a war,</HI> are too widely different to be compared to|gether, or to have inferences drawn from the law of nations re&s;pecting one, applied to the other; in the authorities cited, they are oppo&s;ed to each other. On a peace, da|mages done in war, whether to public or private property, are to be buried in oblivion, the&s;e being <HI>the effects of war</HI>; but debts retain their full force.</P>
<P>Here the Claimants re&s;t the que&s;tion of intere&s;t during the war, with only one remark, That however di&s;po&s;ed they might them&s;elves have been to indulgence and &s;ome allow|ances, if they could have obtained payment of their debts at the peace, it is not rea|&s;onable to expect them now&mdash;nor are they to be bound by what others have done, "<HI>Qui|libet pote&s;t renunciari jure pro &s;e introducto.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="034906_0139_0FFF9472B56353F0">THE Claimants re&s;pectfully tru&s;t and believe, that they have clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed the following points:</P>
<P N="1">1. That in Virginia there exi&s;ted legal impediments to the recovery of all Briti&s;h debts contracted before the peace, from the time of the occlu&s;ion of the Courts in 1774, until the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Federal Judiciary.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the treaty of peace did not, of it&s;elf, by its own mere power, repeal tho&s;e impediments; and that the Legi&s;lature of Virginia, who alone had the power, refu&s;ed to repeal them.</P>
<P N="3">3. That even if the plau&s;ible theory of the repealing power of the treaty was as cor|rect and &s;ound, as it is un&s;ound, or at mo&s;t, doubtful; yet, as the general opinion of the Legi&s;lature and people of Virginia, and the practice of the Courts was the other way, no fault is imputable to the Claimants.</P>
<P N="4">4. That there are impediments yet exi&s;ting, which even the Federal Courts cannot re|move, as they are obliged to determine according to the laws of the State: The&s;e ari&s;e from the lap&s;e of time, which is again&s;t the Claimants, altho' the Courts were &s;hut to them, &s;o that in every in&s;tance, where their books are all their evidence, judgment mu&s;t be given again&s;t them; in ca&s;es where other evidence can be produced, the act of limitations is a bar, altho' it would not have been a bar, could the Claimants have &s;ued at the peace; and in all ca&s;es, where bonds were taken in 1777, for debts due years before, they are reduced by a &s;cale, which the Claimants could not fore&s;ee, and which was pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years after taking the bonds. That as full compen&s;ation can|not in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings be actually had for &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, the United States have agreed to make it. That the General Government is alone an&s;werable for any violation of treaties; and that if the State Governments &s;uffered legal impediments to remain, and in con&s;equence, the claims of creditors have been delay'd, and the common law evidence to &s;upport &s;uch claims lo&s;t by the delay, or &s;tatutes of limitation had run again&s;t them, the General Government cannot avail it&s;elf of the&s;e circum&s;tances; be|cau&s;e this would be fir&s;t to violate a compact by delaying a claim till the evidence of it was lo&s;t, and then to avail them&s;elves of that act which they had created.</P>
<P N="5">5. That proof of the actual in&s;olvency of debtors at the peace, would, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, be impo&s;&s;ible, and that it is not required of the Claimants.</P>
<P N="6">6. That where in&s;olvency, omi&s;&s;ion, or any other cau&s;e, is alledged to have equally operated to produce the lo&s;s, that is the defence of the United States and mu&s;t be &s;up|ported by proof.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the claimants are entitled to full intere&s;t on their demands, and that they are not to wait the event of &s;uits until years after the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hall be broken up.</P>
<P>It remains now to be &s;hewn, how each particular cla&s;s of demands annexed to the memo|rial in this particular claim, comes within the true intent, &s;pirit and meaning of the trea|ty of amity, and on what grounds the Claimants demand payment of the &s;everal &s;ums &s;et forth in the &s;everal li&s;ts. In the An&s;wer on behalf of the United States, (pa. 60.) a re|mark is made upon the li&s;t of debts, which might have been &s;pared; The Claimants are not hurt by it; Con&s;cious of their own integrity, they do not believe any imputation was intended to be ca&s;t upon them; indeed the whole tenor of the An&s;wer forbids them to entertain an idea of the kind.
<Q>It is &s;aid while &s;uch demands furni&s;h a proof <HI>of the ex|treme

The Claimants have been gleaning no books and pa|pers&mdash;It was the con&s;tant practice with the re&s;ident factors of the mercantile hou&s;es in Scotland who had retail &s;tores in Virginia, to make out once in every year and tran&s;mit to their employers, correct li&s;ts of all out&s;tanding debts, divided into three cla&s;&s;es, bad, doubtful, and good&mdash;The factors knew every individual in the neighbourhood of the &s;tores, and the &s;tatements thus made could be relied upon.

The li&s;ts al&s;o furni&s;h full proof of the indu&s;try of the factor in collecting, and the punctuality of the neighbourhood in paying before the war&mdash;No old long&s;tanding debts appear&mdash;none barred by the act of limitations; none which could not be proved agreeably to the book debt law&mdash;But it is &s;aid the demands are too &s;mall to be &s;ubject to the award of the Board &mdash;

&mdash;If this is &s;o, the Claimants mu&s;t be the &s;ufferers; for they cannot fabricate books for large debts, when only &s;mall ones are due.&mdash;But the an&s;wer it|&s;elf affords the Claimants the be&s;t Reply, "The principles of equity are the &s;ame whe|ther the debt be one &s;hilling or one hundred pounds"&mdash;And although, if burthen&s;ome and expen&s;ive proof of every &s;mall claim could be required of the Claimants, they might think it beneath the dignity of a great nation to in&s;i&s;t upon the production of that proof, and if in&s;i&s;ted upon, might in many in&s;tances abandon, rather than pur&s;ue the demand, they al&s;o think, that the burthen of the proof is on the other &s;ide, and that it is more con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of a nation to pay than contend for trifles.&mdash;As there is no power in the Board to li&s;ten and agree to compromi&s;es, the Claimants mu&s;t contend for principles.</P>

The fir&s;t que&s;tion of intere&s;t has been fully argued. All arguments that could apply to lo&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by the depreciation law, will apply to difference of cur|rency.

<HEAD>To the Commi&s;&s;ioners for carrying into effect the <HI>6</HI>th Article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation concluded be|tween his Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States of America, on the <HI>19</HI>th November, <HI>1794.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OBSERVATIONS On the part of the UNITED STATES by their AGENT, to the reply of DANIEL DULANY.</HEAD>
<P>THE agent for the United States regrets that he finds him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of again troubling the board upon the &s;ubject of the claim of Daniel Dulany. The reply contains &s;ome po&s;itions and ob&s;ervations not before urged, which are of real importance and ought not to go unan&s;wered. It con|tains others, which, whether true or not in them|&s;elves, need not and therefore will not be contro|verted.</P>
<P>The material facts in this ca&s;e, according to the al|legations of the claimant, to be found in his original claim and &s;ub&s;equent reply, may be &s;tated as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034906_0144_0FFF94802122D960">Ann Ta&s;ker, &s;ome years before the commence|ment of the revolution war, departed this life, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate, of which a princi|pal part, to the value of &pound;42,000 &s;terling was in cre|dits, evidenced by bonds and otherwi&s;e. By her will &s;he devi&s;ed various pecuniary legacies of the value of &pound;28,000 &s;terling, appointed Daniel Dulany the elder, &s;ole executor, and his &s;on Daniel Dulany the young|er, re&s;iduary legatee. The debts were all contracted and payable in the then colony, now &s;tate of Mary|land, where Ann Ta&s;ker, as well as the debtors and executor, re&s;ided. The executor undertook the tru&s;t, and died in opulent circum&s;tances in the year 1796. The re&s;iduary legatee was and always has been a real Briti&s;h &s;ubject, and the debtors to Ann Ta&s;ker, as well as her executor, became citizens of the &s;tate of Maryland when the &s;eparation of the two countries took effect. During the war the debtors fully paid to the executor, their debts in the lawful money of the &s;tate, which was depreciated at the time of payment, in &s;o much, that upon the &s;um of &pound;12,559 1 8 &s;terling, which was thus received, the lo&s;s was &pound;10,344 8 7 &s;terling, the real value of the money being &pound;3655 11 5, according to the &s;cale of depreciation afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in that &s;tate. For this difference &pound;10,344 8 7 &s;terling, the re&s;iduary legatee now applies for payment from the United States, alledging it ought to be awarded to him under the treaty of 1794, in as much as no re|covery can be had of it, either from the executor, or from the original debtors, who have received acquit|tances in full from the executor. An act of the &s;tate of Maryland was in full force at the time of payment,
<PB N="5" REF="034906_0145_0FFF9481A4C6DB20">
making the money a legal tender. The nece&s;&s;ary proofs for e&s;tabli&s;hing this &s;tatement to the &s;atisfac|tion of the board, the agent for the United States in|&s;i&s;ts &s;hould be produced by the claimant. If the&s;e proofs &s;hall be produced he then contends the ca&s;e is not relievable under the treaty of 1794.</P>
<P>In the an&s;wer to the claim of William Cunning|ham and Company, the agent for the United States di&s;cu&s;&s;ed a variety of propo&s;itions, &s;ome of which con|cern the pre&s;ent claim; &s;uch as that the juri&s;dic|tion of the arbitrators was limited, and that the claim|ant is bound to prove every matter e&s;&s;ential to his ca&s;e to bring it within the relief of the treaty. He al&s;o endeavoured to lay down the true interpretation of the 4th article of the treaty of peace, and the 6th ar|ticle of the treaty of amity, to explain their connection with each other, and to prove that the latter was confined to compen&s;ation in &s;uch ca&s;es only where lo&s;&s;es had happened by rea&s;on of the operation of le|gal impediments contrary to the former. Upon the&s;e &s;everal heads as well as relative to intere&s;t during the war, he begs leave to refer the board to the ar|guments which have been there u&s;ed. The ca&s;e which has been &s;tated pre&s;ents for con&s;ideration the&s;e po&s;itions;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the claimant was always, and is now a real Briti&s;h &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That he was the re&s;iduary legatee of Ann Ta&s;ker, and for the actual re&s;iduum, which exi&s;ted in out-&s;tanding debts was a creditor until the debts were paid.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="034906_0146_0FFF948328D02E60">3dly. That the re&s;iduum was &pound;14,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That the debts were contracted in Maryland, where, when a colony, a legi&s;lative power over its internal affairs was exerci&s;ed, and where the laws regulated the mode of fulfilling and di&s;charging con|tracts there made as in an independent &s;tate.</P>
<P N="5">5th. That Ann Ta&s;ker, the creditor, as well as her executor, and all the debtors were inhabitants of Maryland when the debts were contracted, and &s;o continued always.</P>
<P N="6">6th. That the debts were fully paid by the debtors to the authorized agent of the creditor, who accept|ed the money in payment, gave acquitances, and de|livered up the bonds.</P>
<P N="7">7th. That the acceptance of the money might have been refu&s;ed, and if it had been the legal effect of the refu&s;al would have been a legal que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="8">8th. That the executor, unle&s;s he committed a breach of tru&s;t in receiving the payment, cannot be charged with the lo&s;s by depreciation, nor the debt|ors who have fully and legally di&s;charged their debts, &s;o that this lo&s;s mu&s;t remain with the claimant unle&s;s the United States under the treaties of peace and of amity &s;hall be made re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P N="9">9th. That the difference between the &s;terling value of the money in which the debt was contracted, and the &s;terling value of the money in which it was paid, forms the &s;um which is claimed from the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034906_0147_0FFF94859DC4FCA8">The agent for the United States contends that &s;uch a claim cannot be maintained before the board, who have no authority to award payment by the United States in a ca&s;e &s;o circum&s;tanced, and therefore any &s;uch award will be void. The principle on which the defence of the United States re&s;ts, again&s;t a claim of this de&s;cription is,
<Q>that whenever a debt is completely &s;atisfied according to the laws of the country where the debt was contracted, and to be paid, by the payment of the debtor to the creditor, or his authorized agent which has been accepted, it is a final di&s;charge.</Q>
This, as a general principle, cannot be denied. In the ca&s;e reported by Brown 376, it is expre&s;sly affirmed by the Lord Chancellor that <HI>if a tran&s;action is legally &s;atisfied in the country where it aro&s;e</HI> nothing is left for equity to do. This adjudication related to a contract made before the war in South Carolina, evidenced by bond, and af|terwards &s;atisfied there by a payment in paper money at the legal nominal value in that &s;tate during the war. Whether the creditor was or was not a real Briti&s;h &s;ubject does not appear, and though he were, the principal of lexloci, as to contracts, has the &s;ame operation. If a Briti&s;h &s;ubject will go into Ru&s;&s;ia, and there make a contract with a Ru&s;&s;ian, and the contract is &s;atisfied according to the laws of Ru&s;&s;ia, the &s;atisfaction is final and conclu&s;ive according to the juri&s;prudence of England. Before the revolu|tion, if any Engli&s;hman or Scot&s;man &s;hould have gone from London or Edinburg into the colony of Maryland, and there given a credit, or contracted a debt, a &s;atisfaction there according to the local laws of the colony, would have been deemed a compleat
<PB N="8" REF="034906_0148_0FFF9489E863EF70">
&s;atisfaction in every court at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Under the colonial &s;y&s;tem as well as &s;ince the independence of Maryland, the legi&s;lature could make a paper mo|ney current and a tender in payment, of debts con|tracted within its limits. In many colonies before the war, &s;uch as Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, New Jer&s;ey, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &amp;c. &amp;c. there was a paper currency. The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th particulars above reci|ted, de&s;erve to be well con&s;idered, as they contain the grounds of the defence in this ca&s;e; and the 1&s;t, 2nd, 3rd and 9th are &s;ubmitted, with &s;uch proofs as may be offered concerning them.</P>
<P>The 4th article of the treaty of peace is the ba&s;is of the 6th article of the treaty of Amity. The form|er never meant to annul or &s;et a&s;ide, in whole or in part, any compleat payments which had legally been made to, and excepted by the creditor.</P>
<P>A manife&s;t difference exi&s;ts between payments to a &s;tate and payments to a creditor. If the former <HI>a&s;&s;umed</HI> authority to receive payment it al&s;o abroga|ted what was &s;o done by the provi&s;ion in the treaty. In all adjudications re&s;pecting confi&s;cations or pay|ments into the &s;tate trea&s;uries, it was taken as a foun|dation, that the creditor had never accepted the pay|ment, and was not bound by it. But if a creditor is not bound by his own act in accepting payment ac|cording to the laws of the place, where the contract was made, and where it was to be fulfilled, what is there can bind him? It was by the acts of debtor and creditor that the debt was originally contracted, and it has &s;ince been paid by the one and accepted by the other; the contracts are equally valid, that which in|curred

the debt and that which di&s;charged it. It is not therefore to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the 4th article of the treaty of 1783 was intended to &s;et a&s;ide pay|ments accepted by the creditors them&s;elves, under an idea that &s;uch payments were legal impediments. The impediment ari&s;ing from the receipt of the cre|ditor is an impediment of fact, an impediment which could not have been without his concurrence. Can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that this article was intend|ed to open and un&s;ettle the numberle&s;s liquidations and payments to which the parties, debtor and cre|ditor had agreed? By the 6th article of the treaty of 1794 the United States can be liable in no ca&s;e what|ever, unle&s;s the lo&s;s has ari&s;en from &s;ome legal im|pediments which have prevented a due recovery of the debts in pur&s;uance of the treaty of peace, and lo&s;&s;es of this &s;pecial de&s;cription only are referred to arbitration. This is fully illu&s;trated in the ca&s;e of Cunningham and Company, to which the agent of the United States prays leave to refer.</P>
<P>If this view of the two treaties be correct, and if payment to, and acceptance by a creditor according to law, be not a legal impediment intended to be remov|ed by the 4th article of the treaty of peace, it follows that in ca&s;es where payments in paper money have been accepted by creditors, the lo&s;&s;es, if any, are not reparable under either treaty, but mu&s;t lie as they have fallen.</P>
<P>According to this doctrine, if in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the bonds had been a&s;&s;igned to the claimant by the ex|ecutor, and if the claimant had accepted payment in
<PB N="10" REF="034906_0150_0FFF948EDF34DC70">
paper money he would not be relievable under the treaty of 1794.</P>
<P>There is no difference between the acceptance of the creditor him&s;elf and the acceptance of an autho|rized agent. The executor received full authority by the will of the te&s;tatrix, who died before the war, to receive payment of the&s;e debts, and he alone was legally authorized to receive payment.&mdash;When re|ceived, the executor held the money paid to him in the character of tru&s;tee for the legatees. If in the hands of the tru&s;tee, the money depreciated without his fault, the lo&s;s will fall on the ce&s;tuique tru&s;t for which he has no remedy, and which properly may be termed a misfortune.</P>
<P>But if the executor has committed a breach of tru&s;t either in accepting payment as the claimant, in his reply, &s;eems to intimate, by declaring him
<Q>parti|ceps criminis,</Q>
or by any other act, then the ex|ecutor was re&s;pon&s;ible for it, and his repre&s;entatives may now be made to repair the wrong in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings in Maryland, for let it be recollected that the claimant repre&s;ents him as having died fully &s;ufficient and &s;olvent to make good the lo&s;s here claimed from the United States.</P>
<P>There is a manife&s;t and e&s;&s;ential difference between the confi&s;cation of a debt belonging to an enemy by a &s;overeign, and the payment of a debt by a debtor to an enemy creditor, which he accepts. The hazard that is run of lo&s;ing the debt entirely, by the laws of war, as it may be taken away during the war by con|fi&s;cation, and may not be re&s;tored by the terms of
<PB N="11" REF="034906_0151_0FFF94915ADF97C8">
the peace, may induce the creditor to accept &s;pecific commodities at an over-rated value, or a depreciated paper currency in payment. If under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, the creditor or his agent accepts in full pay|ment a thing not one half the value of the debt, it is his own contract that ought to bind him in rea&s;on, and therefore in equity al&s;o.</P>
<P>Confi&s;cation is a lawful appropriation to public u&s;e of the property of an individual who offends the &s;tate, or who is an open enemy. This property may be re&s;tored by the &s;overeign without interfering with the rights of a third per&s;on. In the ca&s;e of debtor and creditor where payment has been accepted, a re|&s;toration cannot be made without infringing directly or indirectly private rights. Though then it be ad|mitted that the 4th article of the treaty of peace &s;ets a&s;ide the confi&s;cation of debts, it does not al&s;o follow that it &s;ets a&s;ide payments accepted by the creditor or his authorized agent, in a depreciated current money.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Maryland confi&s;cated no part of the debts due to the te&s;tatrix, Ann Ta&s;ker, but in the confi&s;cation laws, the debts were expre&s;sly excepted. This exception proves the &s;en&s;e of Maryland, that a debt paid in depreciated money, was not con&s;idered as a confi&s;cation. The claimant &s;eems to contend that there is no difference between payment in depreciated paper and a confi&s;cation; that the former is a confi&s;|cation in another form. The difference, it is hoped, has been &s;hewn; the former cannot take place with|out the participation of the creditor or his agent; the latter is effected independently of &s;uch participa|tion. In the former ca&s;e, when the money is receiv|ed
<PB N="12" REF="034906_0152_0FFF9494B146DA58">
according to law, the debtor is di&s;charged, and it does not concern him whether a profit or a lo&s;s is made out of it by the creditor. The debt is paid according to the laws of the country, where, by the original contract, it ought to have been paid; and re|lative to payments &s;o made, the laws bind an alien as firmly as a citizen. In whatever light, therefore, the claimant may be con&s;idered, whether as an alien or as a citizen of Maryland (and in one or other of the&s;e lights he mu&s;t be con&s;idered after the 4th day of July, 1776) the tender law made in 1777 by Maryland, mu&s;t operate on the debts <HI>contracted and payable there.</HI> It is hoped it will not &s;eriou&s;ly be di&s;puted that Maryland was an independent &s;tate in the year 1777, for even the Lord Chancellor and the ma&s;ter of the Rolls of England have openly affirmed it. Wright and Nutt Henry Black&s;tone's reports 154. This was a ca&s;e between a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject and a citizen of South Carolina. The &s;ame opinion is declared by Lord Loughborough, in the ca&s;e of Folliott and Ogden. Henry Black&s;tone's re|ports 135.
<Q>A civil war breaks the bonds of &s;ociety and government, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pends their force and effects. It produces in the nation two independent parties, con&s;idering each other as enemies, and ac|knowledging no common judge; therefore, of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, the&s;e two parties mu&s;t be con&s;idered at lea&s;t for a time, as forming two &s;eparate bodies, two di&s;tinct people.</Q>
&amp;c. <BIBL>Vattel, B. 3d. Sect. 293.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>But when a nation becomes divided into two par|ties, ab&s;olutely independent, and no longer acknow|ledging a common &s;uperior, the &s;tate is di&s;&s;olved, and
<PB N="13" REF="034906_0153_0FFF949727026F58">
the war betwixt the two parties, in every re&s;pect, is the &s;ame with that of a public war between two different nations.</Q>
Vattel B. 3. Sect. 295.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by the claimant, that upon the &s;e|verance of an empire into two parts, if one &s;ubject adhere to one part, and another to the other, neither part can annul the contract between the two indivi|duals. It is however a&s;&s;erted, that each part having become a &s;overeign independent &s;tate, has compleat power, if a war &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, to appropriate the contract to its &s;elf, by the rights of war, and to make laws that reach all contracts made and to be fulfilled within its limits, as well tho&s;e between its own &s;ubjects as aliens.</P>
<P>The claimant need not have taken any trouble to a&s;&s;ert that
<Q>if one empire is &s;ubdivided and forms two, the debts contracted, prior to that event, &s;till are to be &s;atisfied.</Q>
This is fully an&s;wered by the fact of the ca&s;e, for the debts have been &s;atis|fied according to the laws of the country where they were to be paid, and this &s;atisfaction is valid every where. Nor though it be admitted that &s;uch debts could not be confi&s;cated or extingui&s;hed by a legi&s;la|tive act of the &s;tate, does it follow that payments made and accepted in the money of the country, declared a legal tender, &s;hall not avail as compleat &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted by the claimant,
<Q>that the &s;tate of Maryland was bound in good faith, &s;o to modi|fy its laws, as to enable him to recover the differ|ence here claimed, and as that has not been done, and perhaps cannot con&s;titutionally be done, that he is now entitled to compen&s;ation under the 6th
<PB N="14" REF="034906_0154_0FFF9498C8E85988">
article of the treaty of amity.</Q>
To this it is an|&s;wered that no &s;uch modification was nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e the treaty of peace not only repealed all legal impediments which had been created to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money, of debts there|tofore contracted, but was always con&s;idered in that &s;tate as the &s;upreme law of the land, which no act of the &s;tate, either before or &s;ince the peace, could con|travene or invalidate. Therefore, this cannot be a &s;ufficient ground for demanding compen&s;ation from the United States under the treaty of amity. If how|ever, a payment accepted by the creditor, be a legal impediment within this treaty, which is not admitted, but denied on the part of the United States; and if it has been annulled, recour&s;e &s;hould be had to the ori|ginal debtors, who are &s;till &s;olvent for the difference in value between the money due and the money paid.</P>
<P>The agent for the United States acknowledges that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf inaccurately when he &s;aid that the treaty of 1794 contemplated no remedy, except what was given by the treaty of 1785; <HI>he meant to have &s;aid that the treaty of</HI> 1794 <HI>contemplated no re|medy except for a lo&s;s that had been occa&s;ioned to the creditor in con&s;equence of the operation of &s;ome legal impediment, contravening the treaty of</HI> 1783, <HI>and without any fault or laches on his part.</HI> Admit|ting that the treaty of peace &s;hall be con&s;trued to annul the confi&s;cations of debts as being a kind of legal impediment meant to be removed; if there is a real difference between debts confi&s;cated and debts paid to the creditors or their agents, duly authorized,
<PB N="15" REF="034906_0155_0FFF949D279FC898">
which it is hoped has been &s;atisfactorily &s;hewn, any argument concerning the former is to be con&s;idered as irrelative to the latter.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted by the claimant, that however the &s;tate might pa&s;s laws to bind its own citizens, it could not pa&s;s laws to bind a &s;ubject of Great Britain. To the&s;e an an&s;wer has been given, and here it is repeat|ed, that a &s;tate, by the laws of nations as recognized by the Engli&s;h law, has a right to pa&s;s laws that &s;hall <HI>govern all contracts made and to be fulfilled within its territory;</HI> and &s;uch laws bind all per&s;ons, as well the &s;ubjects or citizens as foreigners or aliens. A law of this kind is compul&s;ory on all, and foreigners have no right to expect a different law concerning their contracts made and to be fulfilled in the &s;tate, than the &s;ubjects enjoy in the like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this propo&s;ition, nothing urged by the claimant will be found to militate. But it will be ob|vious that it has been avoided, and that the arguments as well as the authorities, on which the claimant has relied, are be&s;ide, and do not meet the principle on which the defence of the United States has been placed.</P>
<P>The claimants &s;eem to rely on a deci&s;ion in the cir|cuit court of the United States, which he has cited as applicable in his favour. The contract was made in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, for a &s;um of money to be paid in France, where the parties intended payment to be made in &s;pecie and not in paper medium called a&s;|&s;ignats. It was decided that the creditor was not bound to <HI>accept</HI> the paper. This deci&s;ion is legal and
<PB N="16" REF="034906_0156_0FFF949F979D49C0">
ju&s;t, but in two points the facts of this ca&s;e differ from the ca&s;e of the claimant. 1&s;t. The contract was made in one &s;tate, to be performed in another. 2d. The a&s;&s;ignats were not accepted in pay|ment.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the a&s;&s;ignats had been accepted in payment by the holders of the bill in France, let it be a&s;ked whether the drawer would not have been forever, and every where di&s;charged. Undoubtedly he would.</P>
<P>The like doctrine is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the other ca&s;e cited by the claimant, Da Co&s;ta, vs. Cole Skinner 272, which is con&s;equently entitled to the like an&s;|wer. There too, payment was not actually accepted in the le&s;&s;ened money of Portugal, but payment was refu&s;ed becau&s;e the parties did not contemplate any change in the value of the money, and the drawer and payee were both Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion in this ca&s;e was not on the validity of a payment accepted in le&s;&s;ened money, but how the payments ought to have been made.</P>
<P>The claimant has al&s;o quoted the &s;entiments of Judge Sitgreaves, in the ca&s;e of Hamilton, vs. Ea&s;|ton, in the circuit court of North Carolina, which need not be que&s;tioned on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and perhaps on no other. They &s;eemed not to furni&s;h any oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;ent defence.</P>
<P>It is thus the agent of the United States has en|deavoured to an&s;wer tho&s;e ob&s;ervations of the claim|ant which have appeared to him mo&s;t material, and
<PB N="17" REF="034906_0157_0FFF94A11A664148">
to &s;upport the propo&s;ition that a lo&s;s ari&s;ing from the payment, by a citizen, of a debt due to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, before the war, in a depreciated currency, the lawful money of the &s;tate where the debt had been contracted, and was payable when a colony, which payment the creditor or his agent, has accepted, is not a lo&s;s that can be awarded to be paid by the U|nited States, under the treaty of 1794, and with great deference his arguments are &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>

<HEAD>In the Ca&s;e of Daniel Dulany.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the purpo&s;e of having a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance, as the <HI>general</HI> que&s;tion which occurs in this ca&s;e, maturely con&s;idered, on full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and argument,</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> that the agent for the United States have leave, within eight days, to lay before the Board &s;uch further argument as he may think pro|per, for obviating the points &s;ugge&s;ted in the fol|lowing que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It has been &s;tated on the part of the United States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See An&s;wer, &amp;c. in Han|bury's ca&s;e.</NOTE> that the effect of the "<HI>conce&s;&s;ion</HI>" made by the treaty on their part was "<HI>to revive</HI>" debts which were held to be &s;atisfied; and in the ca&s;e of pay|ments into the trea&s;ury, before the peace, it never has been di&s;puted that the creditor is entitled to a remedy under the treaty, although it was adjudged in the la&s;t re&s;ort, and held to be a law, that by &s;uch payments into the trea&s;ury, pur&s;uant to an act of the &s;tate declaring the debt to be thereby extin|gui&s;hed, it was accordingly &s;o extingui&s;hed and &s;a|tisfied at law. Is it not, therefore, clearly under|&s;tood by both parties, as a principle, that a di&s;|charge or extinction of the debt at law before the
<PB N="2" REF="034906_0159_0FFF94A6283D7F98">
treaty, is not <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> a bar to the remedy thereby provided; but that it mu&s;t al&s;o appear to have been &s;uch an extinction and di&s;charge as proceed|ed from the <HI>free</HI> concurrence and <HI>voluntary act</HI> of the creditor, and not from the effect and operation of law; &s;uch operation of law, in bar of all legal remedy, being on the contrary relied on as the main foundation of a right to claim under the treaty?</P>
<P N="2">2dly. By the "Tender law" of Maryland, pa&s;&s;|ed in April, 1777, it is enacted that the paper mo|ney in que&s;tion
<Q><HI>&s;hall</HI> pa&s;s current and <HI>be received</HI> in payment and <HI>di&s;charge</HI> of all manner of debts.</Q>
Do the United States contend that any individual living within the &s;tate of Maryland, whether Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubject or American citizen, was at liberty to di&s;rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this law, and ought not to have obeyed it? If not, is the lo&s;s ari&s;ing from his obedience a&s;cri|bable <HI>under the treaties,</HI> to his own <HI>free</HI> concur|rence and <HI>voluntary</HI> act, or &s;olely to the act of the law it&s;elf? Having it in view that the que&s;tion here rai&s;ed, refers, not to an <HI>implied</HI> concurrence, nece&s;|&s;arily connected with all obedience, by fiction or maxim of law, but to that true meaning, purpo&s;e, and under&s;tanding of the party, acting upon choice and fair alternative, which arbitrators in equity are bound to require.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be argued on the part of a public government that an individual was at at liberty, and ought to have di&s;obeyed a preci&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="034906_0160_0FFF94A89776CA48">
and po&s;itive law of the &s;tate in which he lived, would he as a creditor, or the per&s;on for who&s;e be|nefit he acted, have been in a better &s;ituation in con&s;equence of his di&s;obedience? In obeying the law, he received &s;omething; by refu&s;ing to obey it, he would have forfeited all&mdash;for it is al&s;o there|by enacted, that if the creditor refu&s;e to receive the paper money tendered, as a &s;atisfaction, the <HI>whole</HI> debt or demand
<Q><HI>&s;hall be forever extingui&s;hed,</HI> and if any &s;uit &s;hall be commenced for the recovery of &s;uch debt or demand, after tender and refu&s;al as afore&s;aid, the defendant may plead payment, and give this act and the &s;pecial matter in evi|dence.</Q>
&mdash;And further it is thereby provided that it &s;hall, in that ca&s;e, be lawful for the debtor to demand the bond or contract; or a di&s;charge of the debt and if the creditor &s;hall refu&s;e to deliver up the &s;ame or give &s;uch di&s;charge, it &s;hall be lawful for &s;uch debtor to &s;ue him for damages, to the extent of the debt, with co&s;ts of &s;uit.&mdash;How it is to be maintained that a debt was <HI>voluntarily given up</HI> when it could not be &s;aved? Or that a claim under the treaty is to be le&s;s admi&s;&s;ible or ju&s;t for compen|&s;ation on account of his having been deprived by the above law of only <HI>part</HI> of his debt, than it would have been, if, in con&s;equence of his di&s;obe|dience, he had been thereby deprived of the whole? Was the extinction le&s;s compleat, or re|medy more attainable, under the law, in the latter ca&s;e than in the former?</P>

of view&mdash;It has been argued in this ca&s;e, on the part of the United States, that

<P>THE agent for the United States, re&s;pectfully offers the following ob&s;ervations, upon the &s;everal points &s;ugge&s;ted by the commi&s;&s;ioner, in their order of the 7th in&s;tant.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>UPON THE FIRST POINT.</HEAD>
<P>When the agent for the United States, in the cour&s;e of his argument in Hanbury's ca&s;e, repre|&s;ented the effect of the treaty on debts that might have been deemed to have been paid before the peace, he had in view tho&s;e debts only which had been paid into a &s;tate trea&s;ury. The Board will be plea&s;ed to recollect that in Hanbury's ca&s;e the debtor had made payment into the trea&s;ury of Maryland, pur&s;uant to a law of that &s;tate, and that it was only with re&s;pect to the operation of the treaty on trea&s;ury payments that the agent had oc|ca&s;ion to make any ob&s;ervations; and he there|fore tru&s;ts they will be applied to trea&s;ury pay|ments only as they were intended. With re&s;pect to payments accepted by the creditors, whether in paper money, in lands, in hou&s;es, in public &s;ecuri|ties, or in any other commodity, the validity of either of the&s;e, to which both parties, the creditor and debtor had agreed was not imagined to be que&s;tionable.</P>
<P>After the &s;upreme court of the United States
<PB N="8" REF="034906_0164_0FFF94B543F76568">
had decided in the ca&s;e of Hylton, that the pay|ment of the debt into the trea&s;ury of Virginia, in pur&s;uance to the laws of that &s;tate, was not a bar to the action of the plaintiff, becau&s;e the fourth ar|ticle of the treaty of peace had annulled &s;uch a pay|ment, and had placed the creditor and debtor in the &s;ame &s;ituation, as if it never had been made; the agent for the United States would not pre&s;ume to controvert the operation of the treaty on &s;uch payments, though he well knows that many learn|ed and able juri&s;ts avow their di&s;&s;ent from that de|ci&s;ion. This has however e&s;tabli&s;hed, that a trea|&s;ury payment is by the operation of the treaty of peace to be con&s;idered as no payment, to which adjudication not only the courts, but the &s;tates of America have conformed.</P>
<P>In Virginia an act was lately pa&s;&s;ed, authoriz|ing her trea&s;urer to re-pay to the debtor the value in &s;pecie, of the paper money he had paid into the trea&s;ury, and the &s;ame has accordingly been repaid when demanded, &s;o that trea&s;ury payments are null and void to every intent and purpo&s;e. They form no impediment either in law or equity, to the re|covery of any debt, bona fide, contracted before the late war, and due from a citizen of the United States to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject. The debtor is liable in like manner, as if he had made no &s;uch payment, and from him the creditor is bound to u&s;e all rea|&s;onable means to obtain payment, before he can have under any circum&s;tances whatever any ju&s;t ground to apply to the United States. The con|&s;truction

given by the &s;upreme court to the fourth article of the treaty of peace, was &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t liberal, and to extend it further &s;eems inadmi&s;&s;able. If the treaty of peace had not been con&s;trued to an|null the trea&s;ury payments, the creditors would have lo&s;t tho&s;e &s;ums by the laws of war, by con|fi&s;cation; but the American courts have been &s;o liberal as to interpret the treaty to re&s;tore debts paid into the public trea&s;ury. The principle upon which this interpretation re&s;ts has been fully ex|plained in the former argument in this ca&s;e, where it has been contended that there is an e&s;&s;ential dif|ference between a payment into a &s;tate trea&s;ury, and the acceptance of payment by the creditor in any commodity, whether paper money, lands, or public &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion the agent for the United States ought not to omit to ob&s;erve, that the trea|&s;ury payments having been made without the pri|vity or con&s;ent of the creditors, might have been con&s;idered by them only as extingui&s;hing the legal remedy for a time, which was re&s;tored by the trea|ty, in which ca&s;es the treaty might be con&s;trued to remove any impediments of that de&s;cription with|out interfering improperly with private tran&s;ac|tions, or without occa&s;ioning general inconveni|ence. But the agent for the United States does not admit, that it was ever under&s;tood by him, or by the United States, as a general
<Q>principle, that the di&s;charge or extinction of the debt at law

before the peace was a legal impediment, which the treaty of peace removed,</Q>
and con&s;equently that every adju&s;tment, and payment between the debtor and creditor, before that period, was liable to be re-examined and un&s;ettled. On the contra|ry, the agent denies &s;uch a principle, and contends that the Board has no power to make examination into any matter that has been &s;ettled by the debtor and creditor, according to the laws of the land. The juri&s;diction of the commi&s;&s;ioners is con|ceived to be confined to claims again&s;t the United States, in ca&s;es where the debtor and creditor have not &s;o &s;ettled, and which are attended with all the other circum&s;tances requi&s;ite to bring tho&s;e ca&s;es within the treaty of 1794. Upon this &s;ubject, and the true interpretation of the treaties he prays leave to refer to the argument in the ca&s;e of Cunning|ham and Company.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE SECOND POINT.</HEAD>
<P>As a general rule, it is lawful for a creditor to refu&s;e money tendered to him, in payment of a debt, and the con&s;equence of &s;uch refu&s;al is a di&s;|charge from intere&s;t and co&s;ts from the time of the tender, 3d Blac. Com. 303. Ld. Raym. 254. The United States therefore do contend, that according to common law, it was in the power of any indi|vidual creditor, if he plea&s;ed, and that it is at this day, in his power to refu&s;e a tender, whether made in paper or &s;pecie, the lawful current money of the country; and at common law &s;uch refu&s;al is not a public offence. So too, when a &s;tatute declares a
<PB N="11" REF="034906_0167_0FFF94BBBB96BED8">
thing to be money, and &s;hall pa&s;s, and be received as &s;uch, if a creditoe refu&s;es to take it under par|ticular circum&s;tances, he is not chargeable as an offender, with di&s;obeying the law, for if this di&s;obe|dience was a public offence if would be puni&s;hable|able as &s;uch. To refu&s;e paper declared money by &s;tatute is no more a public offence than to refu&s;e metal declared money by &s;tatute. If therefore a creditor accepts a tender, which he might refu&s;e, and a lo&s;s accrues in con&s;equence thereof, it is to be imputed to his own act, and not &s;olely to the &s;tatute which made the money a tender, and it is contended, neither treaty had in view any lo&s;&s;es which aro&s;e in whole or in part from the conduct of the creditor.</P>
<P>Though it be admitted that it was de&s;irable on the part of the United States, that the paper cur|rency &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed freely as &s;pecie from hand to hand, yet many per&s;ons, from di&s;affection to the American cau&s;e, created difficulties, made objec|tions, and thereby occa&s;ioned a depreciation. The&s;e cau&s;es of depreciation, or any other, did not proceed from the will of the con&s;tituted au|thorities.</P>
<P>May it be permitted here to a&s;k, whether on the part of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, or of his &s;ubjects it is contended, that a Briti&s;h &s;ubject ought to have receiv|ed, or was obliged by duty to receive in payment, during the late war, the paper currency emitted by any of the United States? Rather was it not an of|fence, for which by the laws of Great Britain, he
<PB N="12" REF="034906_0168_0FFF94BF1B79BCB8">
was puni&s;hable, as all intercour&s;e was prohibited by his King? And &s;hall he now claim a merit for re|ceiving paper money which the laws of his country try required him to refu&s;e?</P>
<P>As to the power of arbitrators in equity, it can|not be better decided than by the maxims of equity which are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the high courts of equity in Great Britain and America.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ON THE THIRD POINT.</HEAD>
<P>Suppo&s;ing a Briti&s;h &s;ubject had refu&s;ed a tender in paper currency, which he might have done with|out committing a public offence, it is contended that he would have been in a better &s;ituation with re&s;pect to his right to recover his debt under the laws of the land and the treaty of peace, than he is after accepting it. 1&s;t. Let it be ob&s;erved that there is &s;carcely an in&s;tance between citizen and citizen, where the validity of a tender in paper mo|ney has been litigated that it has been maintained. There has been &s;ome defect, either in the quality of the bills or in the time, or in the place, or in the per|&s;on, or in &s;ome other material thing, or as the tender might relate to the contract, for which the tender has been adjudged in&s;ufficient. The doctrine of tenders was little under&s;tood here, 'till after the peace, when a number of law-&s;uits brought the &s;ub|ject before the American courts. Hence it may be inferred, that on legal grounds, the tender would have been unavailing, 2dly. The effect of a ten|der and refu&s;al is always a matter of legal con&s;truc|tion.
<PB N="13" REF="034906_0169_0FFF94C18C535988">
It is not a payment of the debt at common law under any circum&s;tances. It is not a payment of the debt even under the &s;tatute of Maryland, which has been quoted; but the utmo&s;t operation of that &s;tatute would have been to extingui&s;h the remedy of the creditor, but not his right, or even &s;uppo&s;ing the right to be extingui&s;hed 'till the trea|ty of peace was made, this treaty would have &s;et a&s;ide the effect of the tender and refu&s;al, would have revived the right of the creditor upon the like principles, that debts paid into the trea&s;ury may be recovered from the debtors by the credi|tors, which having been the &s;olemn judgment of the court of the United States, is the law of the land.</P>
<P>Thus then it is not admitted that the creditor might not have &s;aved his debt, &s;o as to recover the full value thereof in &s;terling money from his debtor. On the contrary it is contended, that by refu&s;ing the tender, this would have been in his power under the laws of the country and the trea|ty of peace. If by the act of the creditor, the debtor has been di&s;charged, the United States are not, according to any &s;tipulations with Great Bri|tain to be held liable. If the creditor had refu&s;ed the tender, he might have recovered the whole from the debtor, the principal as well as the inter|e&s;t, to which ju&s;tice would have entitled him. The inadmi&s;&s;ibility then of this claim again&s;t the United States, re&s;ts not on the idea that the credi|tor could have had a better title to recover from
<PB N="14" REF="034906_0170_0FFF94C403EA5D78">
the United States the whole, if he had refu&s;ed the tender, than a part &s;ince he accepted the tender, but it re&s;ts on the principle that the creditor has done an act which has forever di&s;charged the debt|or, which act might not have been done, and if o|mitted, the debtor would have been re&s;pon&s;ible for the debt.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>UPON THE FOURTH POINT.</HEAD>
<P>It has been in&s;i&s;ted by the agent for the United States, that by the fourth article of the treaty of peace, it was not intended to &s;et a&s;ide payments ac|cepted by the creditors them&s;elves, under the idea that &s;uch payments are lawful impediments. To prove the truth of this proportion nothing new will be attempted here, but the agent prays leave to refer to his former arguments in this ca&s;e. If true, there &s;eems no room for controver&s;y, for un|le&s;s the treaty of peace did contemplate payments accepted by the creditors, as legal impediments, which it intended to annul; there is no contraven|tion of the treaty in maintaining their validity; con&s;equently from this cau&s;e, no complaint can exi&s;t again&s;t the United States, for which they are to make compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider this point in the view pre&s;ented by the board, it may be contended that the debtor is not di&s;charged, merely by the effect given by &s;ta|tute to payments, where the creditor has accepted in full &s;atisfaction, a commodity of le&s;s than the full value, but the di&s;charge ari&s;es from the acts of the
<PB N="15" REF="034906_0171_0FFF94C59CCC5850">
creditor, who has accepted &s;atisfaction, and given an acquittance. If a creditor received public &s;ecu|rities of the United States, or land, or any &s;pecific commodity, in &s;atisfaction of his debt, and gave an acquittance in full, the debtor is di&s;charged, though there is no &s;tatute giving &s;uch an effect to a tran&s;ac|tion of that kind. Here it may be remarked, that Briti&s;h creditors have received in &s;atisfaction of their debts, many things which have &s;uddenly apprecia|ted in their hands: are the&s;e willing to un&s;ettle their liquidations, and to re&s;tore to the debtors the immen&s;e gains which have accrued from this &s;ource? Would it be rea&s;onble to demand it? Or ought &s;uch gains to be paid to the United States?</P>
<P>With this view of the &s;ubject then, it is urged, that the United States do not act in oppo&s;ition to the treaty of peace, when they maintain the effica|cy of payments in paper money, accepted by the creditors; nor are they chargeable with a breach of that treaty by &s;uffering &s;uch payments to re|main a perpetual bar to any demands of Briti&s;h creditors in full &s;atisfaction of which they have been accepted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>UPON THE FIFTH POINT.</HEAD>
<P>There doubtle&s;s, are ca&s;es in which the creditors who accepted depreciated paper money in payment, may have &s;u&s;tained lo&s;&s;es, but the&s;e lo&s;&s;es ari&s;ing wholly or in part from their own act, are not en|titled to retribution from any quarter; if from any it &s;hould be from the debtors. A claim of this kind
<PB N="16" REF="034906_0172_0FFF94C8F9AD1B30">
only concerns the debtor and creditor; a nation not being an&s;werable for the lo&s;&s;es which accrue to individuals from their dealings with one another, either by the principles of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, or by the u&s;age of nations. Therefore, any argument a|ri&s;ing from the ju&s;tice of making a nation re&s;pon&s;i|ble for any lo&s;&s;es of this kind, it is hoped will not weigh with the Board.</P>
<P>The agent for the United States has endeavour|ed to confine his ob&s;ervations &s;trictly to the matters &s;ugge&s;ted in the order of the Board, and he tru&s;ts that they will obviate and remove all doubts that a claim for compen&s;ation from the United States, on account of payments accepted by Briti&s;h credi|tors in depreciated money, is not by the treaty of amity, &s;ubmitted to the juri&s;diction of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
