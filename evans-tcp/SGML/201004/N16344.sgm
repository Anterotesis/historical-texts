<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not a fondne&s;s for controver&s;y, but a de&s;ire to vin|dicate the honour of Chri&s;t, as lawgiver in his own king|dom; to a&s;&s;ert the &s;criptural importance of a po&s;itive in&s;titu|tion in the hou&s;e of God; and to exculpate him&s;elf, together with a great majority of his brethren of the Bapti&s;t per&s;ua|&s;ion, from charges of an odious kind, that excited the author to compo&s;e and publi&s;h the following pages. If the&s;e de&s;igns be an&s;wered, the writer obtains his end; and if not, he has the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience to the uprightne&s;s of his intentions.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> The Bapti&s;ts not chargeable with laying an unwarrantable Stre&s;s on the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>MANY reflections are ca&s;t on the Bapti&s;ts, the various charges are laid again&s;t them; reflec|tions and charges of &s;uch a kind, as greatly impeach the truth of their doctrinal principles, and the candour of their chri&s;tian temper. They are frequently repre|&s;ented by their Paedobapti&s;t brethren, as <HI>uncharitably rigid,</HI> as <HI>incorrigible bigots</HI> to a favourite opinion, and as putting bapti&s;m in the place of our Lord's <HI>atoning blood</HI> and the <HI>&s;anctifying agency</HI> of the divine Spirit.&mdash;To give them epithets and load them with charges of this kind, the generality of their opponents agree; whether they be members of our National E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, or in the number of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>But why &s;uch unfriendly &s;urmi&s;es and bold accu&s;a|tions? What is there in our principles or conduct that lays a foundation for &s;uch hard &s;u&s;picions and &s;uch &s;e|verity

How far any of tho&s;e who are called <HI>General</HI> Bapti&s;ts, may have given occa&s;ion for &s;uch imputations, I neither take upon me to affirm nor deny.</NOTE> For it is too notorious to admit a plea of ignorance in any of our opponents, that we con&s;ider no one as a proper &s;ubject of that in&s;titution, who does not profe&s;s repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who does not, in o|ther words, appear to be in a &s;tate of &s;alvation. Nay, &s;o far from making bapti&s;m a <HI>&s;aving</HI> ordinance, we do not, we cannot con&s;ider any one as a proper &s;ubject of it, who looks upon it in that light.</P>
<P>Yet were an imputation of this kind as ju&s;t and pertinent, as it is groundle&s;s and ungenerous; did we really a&s;cribe a regenerating efficacy and &s;aving effects to that &s;acred appointment; we &s;hould hard|ly forbear concluding, that the&s;e complaints and charges came with an ill grace from our brethren of the E&s;tabli&s;hment; e&s;pecially from the clergy, who have &s;olemnly declared their a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to all that is contained in the book of Common Prayer. For they, immediately after baptizing an infant, ad|dre&s;s fir&s;t the people, and then the omni&s;cient God, in the following remarkable words; <Q>Seeing dearly beloved brethren, that this child IS REGENERATE and grafted into the body of Chri&s;t's church, let us
<PB N="7" REF="020976_0006_0FB2076760107F00" MS="y">give thanks to Almighty God for the&s;e benefits&mdash; We yield thee hearty thanks, mo&s;t merciful Father, that it hath plea&s;ed thee to REGENERATE this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for THINE OWN CHILD by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy church</Q>&mdash;Thus the clergy mo&s;t &s;olemnly pro|fe&s;s to believe, when they admini&s;ter bapti&s;m to in|fants. And, when giving catechetical in&s;tructions to children, they inculcate on their tender minds the &s;ame things, as truths and facts of great importance. For thus they interrogate each young catechumen, and thus they teach him to an&s;wer. <Q>Who gave you this name? My Godfathers and Godmothers in my bapti&s;m, WHEREIN I WAS MADE a member of Chri&s;t, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven. How many &s;acraments hath Chri&s;t ordained in his church? Two only, as GENERALLY NECES|SARY TO SALVATION, that is to &s;ay; bapti&s;m and the &s;upper of the Lord.

For, that millions die without bapti&s;m, is an undoubted fact; and that God in favour of &s;uch, &s;hould be <HI>frequently departing</HI> from the <HI>ordinary</HI> method of his divine procedure, <HI>much oftener</HI> departing from, than acting according to it, is hard to conceive; is ab&s;olutely incredible, as it involves a contradiction. Yet, on Mr We&s;ley's principles, it mu&s;t be &s;o, if the generality of tho&s;e that have died, &s;ince bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted, be not excluded the kingdom of heaven. For he who con&s;iders what multitudes of Jews and Heathens have peopled the earth, ever &s;ince the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation commenced; what an exten&s;ive &s;pread Mahomet's impo&s;ture has had for more than eleven hundred years; and what numbers of infants die without bapti&s;m, even in Chri&s;tian countries, can|not but conclude, even admitting Paedobapti&s;m to have been practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, that a va&s;t majo|rity of decea&s;ed infants have left the world without being baptized.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. We&s;ley, it is well known, is a very warm defender of general redemption.

In regard, therefore, to all that peri&s;h for want of bapti&s;m, it &s;hould &s;eem, on his principles, as if our divine Lord we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">cis careful to provide <HI>an ad|mini&s;trator</HI> to confer an ordinance, than to <HI>offer a pro|pitiatory &s;acrifice;</HI> and more &s;paring of a <HI>little water,</HI> than of his <HI>owm blood:</HI> even though he knew the latter would be of no avail, in millions of in&s;tances, with|out the former. But whether &s;uch &s;entiments be agreeable to the &s;criptures, or honourable to our Lord's atonement, the reader will be at no lo&s;s to de|termine.</NOTE> Now who could &s;uppo&s;e an author

<P>Nor are we con&s;cious of attributing any degree of importance to Bapti&s;m, which our Paedobapti&s;t Di&s;|&s;enting brethren do not allow, and for which they do not plead. Do we con&s;ider it as a divine appointment, as an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, the admini&s;tration and u&s;e of which are to continue to the end of the world? So do they. Do they con&s;ider it as an ordinance which, when once rightly admini&s;tred to a proper &s;ubject, is never to be repeated? So do we. Do we look up|on it as indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to communion at the Lord's table? So do they. Do we actually re|fu&s;e communion to &s;uch whom we con&s;ider as un|baptized? So do they. No man, I pre&s;ume, if con&s;i|dered by them as not baptized, would be admitted to break bread at the Lord's table, in any of their churches; however amiable his character, or how much &s;oever they might e&s;teem him in other re&s;pects.</P>

Yes, the love of God, in giving his dear, his only Son; and the death of Chri&s;t, as our divine &s;ub&s;titute and propitiatory &s;acri|fice, are the grand objects we are called to contem|plate at the Lord's table.&mdash;As to a <HI>proof,</HI> a <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial proof</HI> of our love to the children of God, it is not given at &s;o cheap and ea&s;y a rate, as that of &s;itting down with them, either acca&s;ionally or &s;tatedly, at the holy table. Numbers do that, who are very far from loving the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, for the truth's &s;ake. To give real evidence of that heavenly affection, there mu&s;t be the exerci&s;e of &s;uch tempers, and the perfor|mance of &s;uch actions, as require much &s;elf-denial; and without which, were we to commune with them ever &s;o often, or talk ever &s;o loudly of candour and a catholic &s;pirit;&mdash;we &s;hould, after all, be de&s;ti|tute of that <HI>charity,</HI> without which we are <HI>"nothing".</HI> The reader, therefore, will do well to remember, that the <HI>true te&s;t</HI> of his love to the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, is, not a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any particular ordinance of public wor&s;hip; for that is rather an evidence of his love to God and reverence for his authority; but &s;ym|pathizing with them in their afflictions; feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and taking plea&s;ure in doing them good, whatever their nece&s;&s;ities may be. For this I have the authority of our final Judge, who will &s;ay o his people; <Q>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Fa|ther, for</Q>&mdash;what?

It is not the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenet of Bapti&s;m, how much &s;oever they wi&s;h it to prevail, that is the main band that knits them in affection to one another: it is the infinitely nobler con&s;ideration of the relation they &s;tand in to Chri&s;t as his di&s;ciples.

But is it not &s;trange, &s;trange to a&s;toni&s;hment, if the &s;criptures contain their &s;entiment, and vindicate their conduct, that it never was di&s;covered by any who acknowledged the proper Deity, the eternal do|minion, and the complete &s;atisfaction of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, till the latter end of the la&s;t century? &s;eeing, long be|fore then, almo&s;t every principle of the Chri&s;tian faith, almo&s;t every branch of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, had been the &s;ubject, either of learned, or unlearned contro|ver&s;y, among &s;uch as thought them&s;elves the di&s;ci|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

No; he would bold|ly preach a <HI>crucified</HI> and ri&s;en Je&s;us, as the only foun|dation of hope for his hearers; and, if the energy of God attended his labours with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, he would think it his duty to lay before &s;uch as believed in Chri&s;t, what he had learned from the New Te&s;ta|ment, relating to a go&s;pel church&mdash;its nature and or|dinances, its privileges, duties, and great utility. In doing of which, he could hardly forbear to mention <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> as an appointment of his divine Ma&s;ter: but though he might <HI>mention</HI> it, yet, on his hypothe&s;is, he could not <HI>require</HI> a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it, as previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to their incorporating as a church, and their having communion together at the Lord's table. He might, indeed, <HI>recommend</HI> it to his young converts, as having &s;omething agreeable in it; but if they did not &s;ee its propriety; or if, on any other account un|known to him, they did not choo&s;e to comply, and yet were de&s;irous of being formed into a church &s;tate,
<PB N="40" REF="020976_0039_0FB207CA6F123F48">and of having communion at the Lord's table; he could not refu&s;e, though not one of them was, or would be baptized.

If the former, ei|ther Je&s;us Chri&s;t di&s;covered &s;ome defect in that plan of proceeding, and, in certain ca&s;es, countermanded his fir&s;t order, or the conduct of our brethren mu&s;t be wrong; they admitting per&s;ons to communion, who; on their own principles, are not baptized. But if they do not look upon this apo&s;tolic precedent, as ex|pre&s;s;ive of the mind of Chri&s;t, and as a pattern for fu|ture imitation to the end of the world; they mu&s;t con&s;ider the apo&s;tles, either as ignorant of our Lord's will, or as unfaithful in the performance of it. Con|&s;equences the&s;e, which cannot be admitted, without <Q>greatly prejudicing the honour and intere&s;t of true religion, and not a little contributing to the cau&s;e of infidelity:</Q> for which rea&s;on they will, no doubt, be abhorred by all our brethren.</P>
<P>Again: It is manife&s;t from that fir&s;t and mo&s;t au|thentic hi&s;tory of the primitive Chri&s;tian church, con|tained in the Acts of the apo&s;tles; that after &s;inners had received the truth and believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they were exhorted and commanded, by unerring teachers, to be baptized without delay. For thus we read; <Q>Repent and <HI>be baptized</HI> every one of you&mdash; When they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they were <HI>baptized,</HI> both men and wo|men&mdash;And Philip &s;aid, If thou believe&s;t with all thy heart, thou maye&s;t. And he an&s;wered and

And he commanded the chariot to &s;tand &s;till: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he <HI>baptized</HI> him&mdash;And was <HI>baptized,</HI> he and all his &s;traightway&mdash;Many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed, and were <HI>baptized</HI> &mdash;And now, why tarrie&s;t thou? <HI>Ari&s;e and be bap|tized</HI>&mdash;Can any man forbid water, that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as we?

Yes, it appears with the brighte&s;t evidence, that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to bapti&s;m was the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the very <HI>fir&s;t</HI> public act of obedience, to which both Jews and Gentiles were called, after they believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And it is equally clear, from the la&s;t of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages here tran&s;cribed, that the highe&s;t evidence of a per&s;on's acceptance with God, though attended with the bapti&s;m of the Holy Spirit in the be&s;towal of miraculous gifts, was &s;o far, in the account of Peter, from &s;uper&s;eding the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ordinance of bapti&s;m; that he urged the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e very facts, as a rea|&s;on why they who were &s;o ble&s;&s;ed and honoured &s;hould &s;ubmit to it <HI>immediately.</HI> Con&s;equently, while our brethren revere the authority by which the
<PB N="47" REF="020976_0046_0FB207E0AE6DA690">apo&s;tles acted, and while they believe that infant &s;prinkling is not bapti&s;m; they are obliged, in vir|tue of the&s;e ancient precedents, and by all that is amiable in a con&s;i&s;tent conduct, to admit none to communion at the Lord's table, whom they do not con&s;ider as really baptized according to the com|mand of Chri&s;t&mdash;Nor have we the lea&s;t rea&s;on to believe that the apo&s;tles were inve&s;ted with a <HI>di&s;cre|tional</HI> power, to alter our Lord's in&s;titutions as they might think proper; either as to mode, or &s;ubject, or their order and connection one with another. No; they never pretend to any &s;uch power; they utterly di&s;claim it. Let us hear the declaration of one, as the language of all, and that in regard to the &s;acred &s;upper. "I have <HI>received of the Lord,</HI> that which al&s;o I delivered unto you." And again, relating to his doctrine in general, when writing to the &s;ame people and in the &s;ame epi&s;tle, he &s;ays; <Q>I deliver|ed unto you <HI>that which I al&s;o received</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi, 23. xv. 3.</NOTE>.</Q> The apo&s;tles being only <HI>&s;ervants</HI> in the hou&s;e of God, had no more authority to alter or di&s;pen&s;e with an ordi|nance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than any other mini&s;ter of the word. Their apo&s;tolic gifts and powers did not at all inve&s;t them with a right of <HI>legi&s;lation</HI> in the king|dom of their divine <HI>Lord.</HI> They were &s;till but <HI>&s;tew|ards; as &s;uch</HI> they claimed regard from the churches, in which they laboured and to which they wrote: at the &s;ame time freely acknowledging, that it was their indi&s;pen&s;able duty to "be found faithful" in the whole extent of their office; they being accountable to the great Head of the church. They acted, there|fore,
<PB N="48" REF="020976_0047_0FB207E22BBB28F0">in the whole compa&s;s of their duty, under the command, and by the direction of the a&s;cended Je|&s;us. Nay, the more they were honoured and ble&s;&s;ed by him, the more were they bound to obey the lea&s;t intimation of his will.</P>
<P>Once more: If we regard <HI>the different &s;ignification</HI> of the two in&s;titutions it will appear, that bapti&s;m ought to precede. In &s;ubmitting to bapti&s;m, we have an emblem of our union and communion with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as our great repre&s;entative, in his death, bu|rial and re&s;urrection: at the &s;ame time declaring, that we <Q>reckon our&s;elves to be dead indeed unto &s;in, but alive to God;</Q> and that it is our de&s;ire, as well as our duty, to live devoted to him. And as, in bapti&s;m, we pro&s;e&s;s to have <HI>received</HI> &s;piritual life; &s;o in communicating at the Lord's table, we have the emblems of that heavenly food by which we <HI>live,</HI> by which we <HI>grow,</HI> and in virtue of which we hope to <HI>live for ever.</HI> And as we are born of God but once, &s;o we are <HI>baptized</HI> but once: but as our &s;piritual life is maintained by the <HI>continued</HI> agency of divine grace, and the comfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of it enjoyed by the <HI>habitual</HI> exerci&s;e of faith on the dying Redeemer, &s;o it is our duty and privilege <HI>frequently</HI> to receive the holy &s;upper. Hence theological writers have often called bapti&s;m, the &s;a|crament of <HI>regeneration,</HI> or of <HI>initiation;</HI> and the Lord's &s;upper, the &s;acrament of <HI>nutrition.</HI>&mdash;Whether, there|fore, we con&s;ider the order of <HI>time,</HI> in which the&s;e two in&s;titutions were appointed; or the order of <HI>words,</HI> in the great commi&s;&s;ion given by our Lord to his mini&s;tering &s;ervants; or the order of admini&s;tra|tion in the <HI>apo&s;tolic practice;</HI> or the <HI>different &s;ignification</HI> of the two &s;olemn appointments, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to bap|ti&s;m ought ever to <HI>precede</HI> a reception of the Lord's
<PB N="49" REF="020976_0048_0FB207E54E2AFBD0">&s;upper. Or, &s;hould any one que&s;tion the validity of this inference, I would only a&s;k; Whether, in regard to the &s;acred &s;upper he might not as well deny the nece&s;&s;ity of always <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> the bread, before it be broken; or of <HI>breaking</HI> the bread, before it be received; or of receiv|ing the <HI>bread,</HI> before the <HI>wine?</HI> Or, by what <HI>better</HI> arguments, he would prove the oppo&s;ite conduct, ei|ther unlawful or improper? Nay, if the&s;e <HI>declarations,</HI> and <HI>facts,</HI> and <HI>precedents,</HI> be not &s;ufficient to determine the point in our favour; it will be exceedingly hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to conclude with certainty, in what order any two in&s;titutions that God ever appointed, were to be admini&s;tered. For, &s;urely, that order of proceeding which agrees with the <HI>time</HI> in which two in&s;titutions were appointed; with the <HI>words</HI> in which the ob&s;ervation of them was enjoined; with the <HI>fir&s;t admini&s;tration</HI> of them by unerring teachers; and with their <HI>different &s;ignification,</HI> mu&s;t be the order of <HI>truth,</HI> the order of <HI>propriety,</HI> and the order of <HI>duty,</HI> becau&s;e it is the order of God. And our brethren will do well to remember, that when Paul commends the Co|rinthians for <Q>keeping the ordinances <HI>as they were delivered to them;</HI></Q> it is plainly and &s;trongly implied, that divine ordinances are given us to <HI>keep;</HI> that they who keep them <HI>as they were in&s;tituted,</HI> are to be com|mended; and that they who do not <HI>keep</HI> them at all, or ob&s;erve them in a <HI>different order</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> from that at fir&s;t appointed, are worthy of cen&s;ure. Nor is the order in which the two po&s;itive in&s;titutions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould be admini&s;tered, le&s;s clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, than the mode and &s;ubject of bapti&s;m. This, however, is a notorious fact, that while the <HI>latter</HI> have been much and warmly di&s;put|ed, the <HI>former</HI> does not appear to have been ever call|ed
<PB N="50" REF="020976_0049_0FB207EA15EBF428">in que&s;tion by the real di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; except in the conduct of tho&s;e few that plead for free com|munion. They, indeed, practically deny that which appears clear as the &s;un, to all other Chri&s;tians, by frequently admitting per&s;ons to the Lord's table, and baptizing them afterwards: for they do not refu&s;e to baptize their Paedobapti&s;t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbers, if they de&s;ire it, though they may have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">low&s;hip with them for ten, or twenty, or fifty ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.&mdash;But have not&mdash;I appeal to the under&s;tanding and the con&s;cience of my brethren them&s;elves;&mdash;have not the Paedobapti&s;ts as good a warrant for their practice, as you have for in|verting the <HI>plain,</HI> the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> the <HI>divinely appointed</HI> order, in which the two po&s;itive in&s;titutions ought to be admini&s;tered? They baptize and then teach; you admini&s;ter the &s;acred &s;upper and then baptize. They baptize thou&s;ands whom they never admit to the Lord's table; you receive to that &s;acred ordinance numbers who, on your own principles, never were, nor ever will be baptized. Do they argue in defence of their practice and endeavour to prove their point, not by expre&s;s commands, or plain facts, recorded in the New Te&s;tament; but by <HI>inferences,</HI> and that, &s;ometimes, from &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of holy writ, as have not, in our opinion, any relation at all to the &s;ub|ject? &s;o do you. For it is not pretended, that there is any <HI>expre&s;s command</HI> to receive unbaptized believers into communion; and as to a <HI>plain precedent,</HI> our breth|ren are equally &s;ilent. The <HI>whole</HI> of their arguing, therefore, mu&s;t be either analogical or inferential. Yet the de&s;ign of it is to &s;how, what is our duty in regard to a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> in&s;titution; an appointment about which we cannot know any thing at all, but from re|velation. But what can that be in divine revelation,
<PB N="51" REF="020976_0050_0FB207EB1B3AE2E0">relating to a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> ordinance, which is neither com|manded in a precept&mdash;a precept relating to the <HI>ordi|nance</HI> in que&s;tion; nor exhibited in an example?

<P>It would, no doubt, have been highly offen&s;ive to God, if the prie&s;ts or the people of old had inverted the order appointed by him, for the admini&s;tation of his own &s;olemn appointments.

Have they any rea&s;on, then, to imagine, that a &s;imilar breach of order is not equally di&s;plea&s;ing to God, un|der the New Te&s;tament economy? If not, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Mo&s;t High has not &s;o great a re|gard to the purity of his wor&s;hip, is le&s;s jealous of his honour, and does not &s;o much in&s;i&s;t on his eternal pe|rogative now, as he did under the former di&s;pen&s;ation: &s;uppo&s;itions the&s;e, which they who acknowledge his univer&s;al dominion and ab&s;olute immutability, will hardly admit.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, I think, be acknowledged, even by our brethren them&s;elves, that we have as good a warrant for omitting an <HI>e&s;&s;ential branch</HI> of an ordinance, or to rever&s;e the order in which the <HI>con&s;tituent parts</HI> of an ordinance were originally admini&s;tered; as we have to lay a&s;ide a divine in&s;titution, or to change the or|der in which two different appointments were fir&s;t fixed.

<P>The &s;entiment which our brethren adopt, if &s;uf|fered to operate in its full extent, would exclude both bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper from the wor&s;hip of God.

<P>If, then, our brethren's grand rule of proceeding be right, we are bound to receive believers, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and have communion with them at the Lord's table, tho' they do not con&s;ider them&s;elves as baptized. And here I would beg leave to a&s;k, Whether they would receive a candidate for communion, whom they e&s;teem as a believer in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has not been bap|tized in infancy; nor, looking on bapti&s;m as a tem|porary in&s;titution, is willing to be baptized at all?
<PB N="54" REF="020976_0053_0FB207F7EC0BF0A0">The &s;uppo&s;ition of a per&s;on, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, applying for fellow&s;hip at the Lord's table, is far from being improbable; nay, I have known it a real fact.

<P>Nor is the title of the &s;ame plea, under the &s;igna|ture of <HI>Candidus,</HI> any way different in its real import, for it runs thus: <Q>A mode&s;t plea for Free Commu|nion at the Lord's table; <HI>Particularly</HI> between the Bapti&s;ts and Paedobapti&s;ts.</Q> For it is manife&s;t that the emphatical word, <HI>Particularly,</HI> if not quite im|pertinent, defends free communion, between <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Paedo|bapti&s;ts;</HI> yet that he is far from denying, nay, that he <HI>really pleads</HI> for the &s;ame free communion, with tho&s;e that are neither the one or the other. And who can they be but <HI>Katabapti&s;ts,</HI> or tho&s;e in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances with the per&s;on in the ca&s;e here &s;uppo&s;ed? So that whether they be <HI>Quakers,</HI> or <HI>Catholics;</HI> whatever their di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;entiments or modes of wor&s;hip may be; they con&s;ider them&s;elves as bound to admit them to the &s;acred &s;upper if they look upon them as true believers, and they reque&s;t communion with them. But as all our opponents are not entirely of their mind in this re&s;pect, I &s;hall proceed with the argument.&mdash;If, then, they receive a per&s;on, in the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, they avowedly reject bapti&s;m, as un|nece&s;&s;ary to fellow&s;hip in a church of Chri&s;t; for if

But if they reject him purely on that ground, they ought, on their Antipaedobapti&s;t prin|ciples, to reject <HI>all</HI> who have had no other than infant bapti&s;m; becau&s;e they con&s;ider it as a very different thing from the appointment of Chri&s;t. Yes, they declare to all the world, every time they admini&s;ter bapti&s;m on a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, to any of their Pae|dobapti&s;t friends, that they do not believe infant &s;prinkling to be an ordinance of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be objected; <Q>The two ca&s;es are not parallel: becau&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ed candidate for communion, is not only unbaptized, but oppo&s;es the ordinance it&s;elf.</Q> True: but, admitting a &s;mall di&s;parity, he acts on a principle of con&s;cience; for he &s;uppo&s;es, with the Quakers, that bapti&s;m was not in|tended, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a &s;tanding ordinance in his church; though he has a very different view of the Lord's &s;upper. And, to adopt a method of ar|guing u&s;ed by our brethren, when pleading for free communion; What have you to do with another man's con&s;cience, in a matter that is non-e&s;&s;ential? To his own Ma&s;ter he &s;tands or falls. He con&s;iders the Lord's &s;upper as a very important ordinance, and longs to partake of it.

The following is a well authenticated fact. Several per&s;ons, being convinced of believers bapti&s;m, and wi&s;hing for fellow&s;hip with the people of God, related their Chri&s;tian experience to a church and her pa&s;tor who practi&s;e free communion.

But when the time appointed for their being baptized came, and the pa&s;tor was ready to admini&s;ter the ordinance to them, one of them was ab&s;ent; and, con&s;equently, was not baptized with his brethren. The &s;tated &s;ea&s;on for celebrating the death of Je&s;us at his own table quickly approaching, he was, notwith&s;tanding, received into fellow&s;hip, had com|munion at the Lord', table, and was baptized after|wards.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I be not greatly deceived, the Pa&s;tor of this church has pleaded the cau&s;e of free communion, under the name of <HI>Pacificus.</HI> A character, no doubt, very happily cho&s;en, to expre&s;s that peculiarly peace|ful temper and admirably conde&s;cending conduct, which are &s;o clearly di&s;played in this little anecdote.

By their conduct, in many in&s;tances, it al&s;o appears they are no le&s;s per&s;uaded, that unerring wi&s;dom and &s;upreme authority united in appointing bapti&s;m to be admini&s;tred <HI>prior</HI> to the Lord's &s;upper: for, where the views and the incli|nations

Again: as the &s;overeign will of God is more con|cerned and manife&s;ted in po&s;itive ordinances than in any other branches of holy wor&s;hip; &s;o it is evident, from the hi&s;tory of the Jewi&s;h church, which is the hi&s;tory of Providence for near two thou&s;and years; that the <HI>divine jealou&s;y</HI> was never &s;ooner in&s;lamed, nor ever more awfully expre&s;&s;ed, than when God's an|cient people failed in their obedience to &s;uch com|mands, or deviated from the pre&s;cribed rule of &s;uch in&s;titutions. The de&s;truction of Nadab and Abihu, by fire from heaven: the breach that was made upon Uzzah; the &s;tigma fixed and the cur&s;es denounced on Jeroboam; together with the fall and ruin of all man|kind, by our fir&s;t father's di&s;obedience to a po&s;itive command, are among the many authentic proofs of this a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;Nor need we wonder at the divine procedure, in &s;everely puni&s;hing &s;uch offenders. For knowingly to di&s;obey the po&s;itive laws of Jehovah, is to impeach his wi&s;dom, or his goodne&s;s, in &s;uch in|&s;titutions; and impiou&s;ly to deny his legi&s;lative au|thority and ab&s;olute dominion over his creatures.

<P>Though the Lord's &s;upper is a po&s;itive in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and though we cannot know any thing at all about it, but what we learn from the New Te&s;tament; yet our brethren make, not the word of revelation, but the mea&s;ure of light and the di&s;po&s;itions of a candidate for fellow&s;hip, the rule of admi&s;&s;ion to it.&mdash;This appears from hence. A per|&s;on applies to one of their churches for communion in the ordinances of God's hou&s;e; the pa&s;tor of which community, and a great majority of its members, are Bapti&s;ts. He gives a rea&s;on of the hope that is in him, to general &s;atisfaction. His moral conduct is good,
<PB N="75" REF="020976_0074_0FB20825BB17B750">and his character amiable. The pa&s;tor in the name of the church, de&s;ires to know, what are his views of <HI>bapti&s;m.</HI> He declares him&s;elf a Paedobapti&s;t; &s;ays he was bapti&s;ed in his infancy, and is quite &s;atisfied with it. Now, neither the pa&s;tor, nor the generali|ty of his people, can look upon this as bapti&s;m; but con&s;ider it as an invention of men, and a corruption of the wor&s;hip of God. Con&s;equently, they would be glad if his views, in that re&s;pect, were otherwi&s;e. They agree, however, to receive him into commu|nion. And why?

On this foundation they admit him to the Lord's table: and, which is very remarkable, they receive him with a cordial good will, to have him baptized afterwards, if ever he di&s;cover an inclina|tion towards it. Their charity forbids them treating a Chri&s;tian as <HI>unbaptized,</HI> if he do but <HI>heartily be|lieve</HI> him&s;elf to be baptized.

<P>When a Paedobapti&s;t applies for communion with Bapti&s;ts, he acts upon a per&s;ua&s;ion that he has been
<PB N="82" REF="020976_0081_0FB2083941491618">rightly and truly baptized: for there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the generality of our Paedobapti&s;t brethren would &s;tart at the thought of partaking at the Lord's table, while they con&s;ider them&s;elves as unbaptized. Con&s;equently, when our opponents admit one of them to communion, they confirm him in what they con&s;ider as a fal&s;e pre&s;umption, and practically ap|prove of what, at other times, they boldly pronounce <HI>a human invention, a tradition of men,</HI> and <HI>will-wor&s;hip;</HI> for &s;uch infant &s;prinkling mu&s;t be, if not a divine appointment.

<P>That circumci&s;ion was, by divine command, an indi&s;pen&s;able qualification, in every male, for a par|ticipation of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over, and communion in the &s;anctuary wor&s;hip, is generally allowed. And though I am far from thinking that bapti&s;m came in the place of circumci&s;ion, as many of our Paedobap|ti&s;t brethren &s;uppo&s;e; yet that the former is equally nece&s;&s;ary to communion at the Lord's table, under the Chri&s;tian economy, as the latter was to every male, in order to partake of the pa&s;chal fea&s;t, and to unite in the tabernacle &s;ervice, I am fully per&s;uaded. Nor is my opinion &s;ingular. It has been the &s;en&s;e of the Chri&s;tian church in every age; and, excepting tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts who plead for free communion, it is the voice of the Chri&s;tian world in general at this day.&mdash;I do not find that the nece&s;&s;ity of circumci&s;ion,
<PB N="83" REF="020976_0082_0FB20839F0900D78">for the purpo&s;es ju&s;t mentioned, was ever controvert|ed, either by the ancient or modern Jews. We will &s;uppo&s;e, however, for the &s;ake of argument, that it was di&s;puted in the Jewi&s;h church; and that, amid&s;t a great variety of intere&s;ting intelligence, which the Rabbinical writers pretend to give, concerning ancient cu&s;toms and ancient di&s;putes, they are found to &s;peak as follows: <Q>In the days of our ma&s;ter, Mo&s;es, di&s;|putes aro&s;e about the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of cir|cumci&s;ion: that is, whether the ancient rite was to be performed on the <HI>fore&s;kin,</HI> or on a <HI>finger;</HI> and, whether it was an indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite qualifica|tion, in every male, for a &s;eat at the pa&s;chal fea&s;t, and admi&s;&s;ion to the &s;anctuary wor&s;hip. The ge|nerality of our fathers maintained, that no male, though a &s;on of Abraham; that no Gentile, though he might acknowledge and &s;erve Abraham's God; had any claim to communion in tho&s;e joyful and &s;olemn &s;ervices, if he was not circumci&s;ed accord|ing to the divine command, Others contended, with no le&s;s a&s;&s;urance, that circumci&s;ion being only an <HI>outward &s;ign</HI> of what is internal and &s;piritu|al; every male, whether a de&s;cendent from the loins of our father Abraham, or one of the Gentile race, who knew and feared the God of I&s;rael, had an undeniable claim to fellow&s;hip, though it were not the fore&s;kin of his fle&s;h, but a finger that was circumci&s;ed. The latter a&s;&s;erted, with great con|fidence, that the holy ble&s;&s;ed God having accepted &s;uch; as plainly appeared by their having the in|ternal and &s;piritual circumci&s;ion; it would be <HI>ab|&s;urd</HI> and <HI>uncharitable</HI> to refu&s;e them communion.

This, we readily acknowledge, is a mi&s;|take; nor dare we, on any account, imitate their proceedings in that re&s;pect: becau&s;e, with us, there is no doubt, that the God of our fathers ordained it otherwi&s;e.

<P>Now &s;uppo&s;ing our brethren in the cour&s;e of their reading to meet with &s;uch an account, what would they think of it? What would they &s;ay? They would, undoubtedly, &s;u&s;pect the truth of the whole. They would con&s;ider it as a Rabbinical fable. But how would their indignation ri&s;e, were the fabulous narrator to proceed and a&s;&s;ert; <Q>That Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua, warmly e&s;pou&s;ing this latter opinion, ad|ded

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> Several Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture con&s;idered, which our Breth|ren produce in favour of their Sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>THE cau&s;e which our brethren undertake to de|fend, is denominated by them, <HI>Free Communion.</HI> That communion, then, for which they plead, is <HI>free.</HI> But here I beg leave to a&s;k, From <HI>what?</HI> The re|&s;traints of <HI>men?</HI> that is a laudable freedom. From the laws of <HI>Heaven?</HI> that were a licentious liberty. Ab&s;urd, in theory; impo&s;&s;ible, in fact. It never was, it never can be the ca&s;e, that God &s;hould in&s;titute a po&s;itive ordinance of divine wor&s;hip, as the Lord's &s;upper undoubtedly is; and leave it entirely to the di&s;cretion of men, to whom it &s;hould be admini&s;tered. Free&mdash;for <HI>whom?</HI> For every one that will? This they do not pretend. For all who imagine them&s;elves believers and qualified for it? This they dare not a&s;&s;ert. For, notwith&s;tanding all their candour and
<PB N="92" REF="020976_0091_0FB2085185DDF7E8">all their catholici&s;m, they do not con&s;ider every one that thinks him&s;elf a believer and de&s;ires communion, as fit for it. Hence it is, they a&s;k a rea&s;on of the candidate's hope, and take the liberty of judging for them&s;elves, what his hope and the ground of it are. They think it their duty to inquire, in what light he views him&s;elf and what he believes concerning the Son of God. And if, in their judgment, he be not con|verted to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they put a negative on his re|que&s;t; even tho' they feel an affection for him, as a mo|ral, a &s;incere, a well meaning man. Here, then, is an|other and great limitation; a boundary which it would not be lawful to &s;et, if a po&s;itive in&s;titution were not concerned, and if &s;uch limitation were not fixed by the divine In&s;titutor. By parity of rea&s;on, therefore, if our Lord has given any other direction, relating to the &s;ame ordinance, it &s;hould be regarded with equal reverence and equal punctuality.</P>
<P>What, then, is the <HI>freedom</HI> for which they plead? Why, that Bapti&s;t churches &s;hould admit Paedobap|ti&s;ts into communion with them. In other words, That they &s;hould admit believers to the Lord's table, whom they con&s;ider as unbaptized. A very extra|ordinary po&s;ition this! Such, however, is <HI>free com|munion:</HI> in defence of which, &s;everal pamphlets have, of late, been publi&s;hed. And who can tell, but &s;ome of our brethren may &s;o improve on the doctrine of liberty, in regard to divine in&s;titutions of a po&s;itive nature, as to favour us, ere long, with a <HI>Plea for free Bapti&s;m?</HI>&mdash;With a di&s;&s;ertation, intended to prove the lawfulne&s;s, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the nece&s;&s;ity, of admini&s;tering bapti&s;m to &s;uch whom we con&s;ider as unbelievers? e&s;pecially, if the candidates for that or|dinance be firmly per&s;uaded in their own minds, that

<P>The principal pa&s;&s;ages adduced from holy writ, and here to be con&s;idered, are the following:&mdash; <Q>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful di&s;putations&mdash;for God hath received him&mdash;Receive ye one another, as Chri&s;t al&s;o re|ceived us, to the glory of God&mdash;God, which know|eth the hearts, bare them witne&s;s, giving them the Holy Gho&s;t, even as he did unto us: and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith&mdash;I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means &s;ave &s;ome. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom xiv. 1, 3. and xv. 7.

<P>Again: The texts produced do not &s;o much as <HI>mention</HI> communion at the Lord's table, nor appear
<PB N="94" REF="020976_0093_0FB2085661967ED8">to have the lea&s;t reference to it. No; the Holy Gho&s;t has other objects in view, in each of the con|texts. And as the&s;e are the principal pa&s;&s;ages to which our brethren appeal in proof of their point, we may take it for granted, that better are not to be found; and, con&s;equently, as a tacit acknowledgment, that po&s;itive proof is wanting. But if it be allowed, that there is no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> evidence in favour of their practice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> amounts to a conce&s;&s;ion that there is <HI>no proof</HI> at all. Becau&s;e nothing of a po&s;itive and ritual nature can be proved a duty, or agreeable to the will of God, merely by our own rea&s;onings; nor by arguments formed on moral precepts and general rules of con|duct. For if once we admit any thing in the wor&s;hip of God, as a duty, that is grounded, either on far-fetched inferences from particular declarations of &s;crip|ture, in which the holy penmen do not appear to have had the lea&s;t thought of the matter in que&s;tion; or on our own ideas of expediency and u&s;efulne&s;s, we &s;hall not know where to &s;top. On this principle, a great number of ceremonies were brought into the church of Rome, and might be introduced by us, though not one of them could &s;tand that divine que|ry, "Who hath required this at your hand?" As it cannot be proved, by the deductions of rea&s;on, that it is the duty of any man to eat bread and to drink wine, as a branch of divine wor&s;hip, but only from the te&s;timony of God, &s;o what he has revealed in re|gard to that matter, is our only rule in all that re|lates to the Lord's &s;upper.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plain account of Bap.

<P>The converted Romans were commanded by Paul, to <Q>receive them that were weak in faith, as God and Chri&s;t had received them.</Q> And we are plainly informed, that the per&s;ons intended were &s;uch, as had not a clear di&s;cernment of their Chri&s;tian
<PB N="97" REF="020976_0096_0FB2085F762FB058">liberty, in regard to <HI>the eating of meats</HI> forbidden by the ceremonial law, and <HI>the ob&s;ervation of days,</HI> that was of old required by it. But what has this to do with <HI>free communion?</HI> Is there no way of <Q>receiving him that is weak in faith,</Q> but by admitting him to the Lord's table? Mu&s;t the exhortation to receive a Chri&s;tian brother, be confined to that &s;ingle in&s;tance of true benevolence? Or, is our &s;o doing the capital idea and the primary &s;en&s;e of the precept, in any of Paul's writings? He &s;ays, in this very epi&s;tle, <Q>I commend unto you Phebe our &s;i&s;ter,&mdash;that <HI>ye receive her</HI> in the Lord.</Q> Was her admi&s;&s;ion to the holy table the principal thing that he de&s;ired of the belie|ving Romans, on her account? No; he evidently had &s;omething el&s;e in view; &s;omething that would manife&s;t their love to a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, much more than barely permitting her to have communion with them in the &s;acred &s;upper.

<P>Be&s;ides, the faith of a &s;incere believer may be as weak, and require as much forbearance, in regard to the holy &s;upper, as in re&s;pect of bapti&s;m. A refor|med and really converted Catholic may de&s;ire fel|low&s;hip with us, who &s;till retains the Popi&s;h error of communion in one kind only: but are we obliged by this apo&s;tolic precept, to mutilate the &s;acred ordi|nance in conde&s;cen&s;ion to his weakne&s;s?&mdash;To em|brace the weak, as well as the &s;trong believer, in the arms of Chri&s;tian affection, is a capital duty of the moral law. To bear with a brother's infirmities, and to "forbear one another in love," are certainly required by that command which &s;ays; <Q>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf;</Q> and would have been our duty, if neither bapti&s;m, nor the Lord's &s;upper, had ever exi&s;ted. But are we to regulate our conduct, in the admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons to a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> in&s;titution;&mdash;to one which depends entirely on the <HI>&s;overeign plea&s;ure</HI> of God, by inferences drawn from the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> duties of the moral law?&mdash;Were the precepts of that eternal law ever con&s;ider|ed
<PB N="99" REF="020976_0098_0FB208640137A540">by the prie&s;ts or the people of old, as the rule of admini&s;tering po&s;itive in&s;titutions?

Concerned and grieved at &s;uch contentions and &s;uch a breach of brotherly love, in a once flouri&s;hing and happy church, he writes a friendly letter; in which he bewails their hurtful conte&s;ts, gives them his be&s;t advice, and, among other things, he &s;ays: <Q>Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye, but not
<PB N="111" REF="020976_0110_0FB205F6273EFF40">to doubtful di&s;putations. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another who is weak, eat|eth herbs.

Wherefore receive ye one another, as Chri&s;t al&s;o received us to the glory of God.</Q>&mdash; In a while-after this healing epi&s;tle is publi&s;hed, and read by many. In the peru&s;al of which, &s;ome &s;u&s;|pect, and others conclude that the per&s;ons exhorted to mutual forbearance, had <HI>not communion</HI> one with another, under the pa&s;toral care of Candidus, and that they who are &s;tiled, "weak in faith," had never been <HI>baptized.</HI> Nay, &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that the mere <HI>want of bapti&s;m,</HI> in the opinion of Irenaeus, ought never to be objected again&s;t any that are candidates for commu|nion at the Lord's table; nor ever be made a bar to fellow&s;hip in a church of Chri&s;t. Yet Irenaeus was ne|ver known, in any in&s;tance, to give the lea&s;t cau&s;e for &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion. The application is ea&s;y: I &s;hall there|fore only a&s;k, Whether, in the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, &s;uch in|ferences would be genuine and ju&s;t, or forced and unnatural? and, whether they who drew them might not be &s;u&s;pected of being, either very fanciful and weak, or as acting under the power of &s;ome pre|judice? The reader will pardon my prolixity on this pa&s;&s;age, when he con&s;iders that our opponents lay a very great &s;tre&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>By the text produced from the acts of the apo&s;tles we learn, that "God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons;" that he, as an ab&s;olute &s;overeign, be&s;tows his favours on Jews and Gentiles without any difference. But will our brethren infer from hence, that they who&s;e honour and happine&s;s it is to be his obedient &s;er|vants,

<P>Once more: They produce, as much in their fa|vour, the declarations of Paul to the church at Co|rinth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix. 19&mdash;23.</NOTE> relating to his own conduct. And what do we learn in general from this pa&s;&s;age, but that he, out of his great concern for the good of mankind, and his abundant zeal for the glory of God, was wil|ling to do, or forbear, any thing that was lawful, in order to gain an impartial hearing from both Jews and Gentiles wherever he came? I &s;aid, any thing that <HI>was lawful;</HI> the rule of which is the divine precept, or &s;ome example warranted by divine authority. Nor can we view the&s;e words in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, without implicitly charging the great apo&s;tle with <HI>temporizing,</HI> and highly impeaching his exalted character.&mdash;But what has this text, any more than the former, to do with the admini&s;tration, or lay|ing a&s;ide, of po&s;itive in&s;titutions? It was the duty of Aaron, as well as of Paul, and of us, to &s;eek the hap|pine&s;s of his fellow creatures and the honour of God, to the utmo&s;t of his ability. But was this general obligation the rule of his performing the &s;olemn &s;anctuary &s;ervices on the great day of atonement? Could he conclude from hence, that if the di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ti|ons of the people required it, he was at liberty to <HI>omit</HI> any of the &s;acred rites, or to <HI>tran&s;po&s;e</HI> the order in which <HI>Jehovah</HI> commanded they &s;hould be perform|ed?

For they will readily allow, that an intere&s;t in the divine favour, is not <HI>obtained</HI> by the mi&s;erable &s;inner, but <HI>granted</HI> by the Eternal Sovereign.

<P>Bapti&s;m is <HI>not fundamental;</HI> is <HI>not e&s;&s;ential.</HI> True; it limited to the foregoing ca&s;es.

<P>Is not the in&s;titution of bapti&s;m a branch of divine wor&s;hip?

Nay, <HI>Pacificus</HI> him&s;elf tacitly allows, that the practice of free communion is a breach of order in go&s;pel churches. For, in an&s;wer to an objection of this kind, he &s;ays; <Q>Though it be admitted that the order of churches is of <HI>great</HI> importance, yet it mu&s;t be admitted that the edification of Chri&s;|tians, and their obedience to the acknowledged command of Chri&s;t to all his di&s;ciples, "Do this in remembrance of me," are points of <HI>infinitely greater</HI> importance; the lea&s;t therefore ought to give way to the greate&s;t.</Q>&mdash;The order of churches, then, is of <HI>great</HI> importance, <HI>Pacificus</HI> him&s;elf being judge; and <HI>Candidus,</HI> his colleague, acknowledges, that it <Q>is of <HI>&s;ome</HI> importance.</Q> Nor could they deny it, without impeaching the wi&s;dom, or the goodne&s;s of
<PB N="116" REF="020976_0115_0FB205FDA349A548">Chri&s;t, as Lord over his own hou&s;e; and impo&s;ing that injunction of the Holy Gho&s;t, <Q>Let all things be done decently and in order.</Q> And as the Di|vine Spirit requires the ob&s;ervation of order in the church of God, &s;o Paul commends the Corinthians for "keeping the ordinances <HI>as he delivered them;</HI>" and expre&s;&s;es a holy joy, on "beholding the order" of that Chri&s;tian church which was at Colo&s;&s;e. But that order which the great Lord of all appointed, and in the practice of which the good apo&s;tle &s;incere|ly rejoiced, our brethren, it &s;eems, con&s;ider as <HI>a mere trifle</HI>&mdash;as comparatively <HI>nothing.</HI> For what is any thing that has only a <HI>finite</HI> importance attending it, when compared with that which is of <HI>infinite</HI> im|portance?

Yet thus our opponents venture to &s;tate the comparative worth of church or|der, and the edification of individuals.&mdash;But give me leave here to inquire, Whether the primitive order of go&s;pel churches can be detached from the le|gi&s;lative authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? And, whether the exerci&s;e of that authority can be con&s;idered as having no connection with his honour? To an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in the negative, free communion it&s;elf can hardly demur. Con&s;equently, a breach of that or|der which Chri&s;t appointed, as king in Zion, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an oppo&s;ition to his crown and dignity; and <HI>his honour</HI> is of much greater importance than the edification of believers. For our Je&s;us and our Lawgiver is <HI>Jehovah;</HI> between who&s;e <HI>honour</HI> and the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of &s;inful worms, there is, there can be no compari&s;on.

<PB N="117" REF="020976_0116_0FB205FFE306F310">grace. I may, therefore, venture to retort the ar|gument; Though it be admitted, that the edifica|tion of Chri&s;tians is of <HI>great</HI> importance; yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that the honour of our divine Sovereign is of <HI>infinitely greater</HI> importance; and, con&s;equently, the primitive order of the go&s;pel churches &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Again: Are not my readers a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the rea&s;oning of our opponents which I have ju&s;t produced? Are they not ready to &s;ay, with &s;ome of old, "May we know what this new doctrine is?" What, rever&s;e the order of churches, appointed by God him&s;elf, with a view to edification! Di&s;pen&s;e with a po&s;itive ordinance of heaven, and break a di|vine command, under the fair pretence of promot|ing obedience to Chri&s;t! Our brethren, in pleading for free communion, bring <Q>certain &s;trange things to our ears; we would know, therefore, what the&s;e things mean,</Q> and how they may be &s;up|ported. For if we are obliged, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to &s;et a&s;ide an ordinance of divine wor&s;hip, and to break a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> command, in order that certain in|dividuals may perform <HI>another po&s;itive</HI> injunction of the great Legi&s;lator; the laws of Chri&s;t are not half &s;o con&s;i&s;tent as Paul's preaching; <Q>which was not yea and nay,</Q> as tho&s;e would be, if the argument here oppo&s;ed were valid.&mdash;Nor have we, that I remem|ber, any thing like a parallel ca&s;e, either in the Old or New Te&s;tament. We find, indeed, an in&s;tance, or two, of po&s;itive and typical rites giving way to natural nece&s;&s;ities and moral obligations, when the performance of both was impracticable; as, when David are of the &s;hew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ead, without incurring a di|vine cen&s;ure: but we have no example of a po&s;itive

That maxim of our Lord, <Q>I will have mercy and not &s;acrifice;</Q> is, therefore, to|tally inapplicable in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Bunyan, I know, &s;trenuou&s;ly pleads the ne|glect of circumci&s;ion by the I&s;raelites in the wilder|ne&s;s, while they attended on other po&s;itive appoint|ments of God, as arguing &s;trongly for free commu|on; but he &s;eems to have forgotten that the omi&s;&s;ion of which he &s;peaks, is keenly cen&s;ured by the Holy Gho&s;t. The uncircumci&s;ed &s;tate of the people, whatever might be the occa&s;ion of it, is called, <HI>a re|proach,</HI> "the reproach of Egypt;" which odium was rolled from them on the borders of Canaan, and the place in which they were circumci&s;ed was called by a new name, to perpetuate the memory of that e|vent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. v. 9.</NOTE> Now, as that neglect of the I&s;raelites was a <HI>breach</HI> of the divine command, <HI>a reproach</HI> to their character as the &s;ons of Abraham, and &s;tands <HI>con|demned</HI> by the Spirit of God; it cannot be pleaded in defence of a &s;imilar omi&s;&s;ion, with the lea&s;t appear|ance of rea&s;on. And if &s;o, I leave our brethren to judge whether it can be imitated <Q>without injuring the honour of true religion, and promoting the cau&s;e of infidelity.</Q>&mdash;Nor is that other in&s;tance, which the &s;ame author produces, relating to the fea&s;t of pa&s;&s;over, in the reign of Hezekiah, any more to his purpo&s;e.

<P>Di&s;turb and break the order of churches, or or|der by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with a view to edification?

The church of England al&s;o has retained the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, and claims a power to decree rites and ceremonies in di|vine wor&s;hip whenever &s;he plea&s;es; and all, no doubt, with a view to <HI>edification.</HI> Yet I never heard that either of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, arrogant as the for|mer is, ever talked of <HI>altering</HI> the primitive order of the Chri&s;tion church, or of <HI>omitting</HI> an ordinance, allowed to be divine, with a view to edification. Our brethren, however, plead for this; and, which is equally wonderful, they plead for it under the &s;pe|cious pretext, that a <HI>command</HI> of Chri&s;t may be per|formed.

For he who is indifferent to the performance of what he con&s;iders as a command of God, treats God him&s;elf with an equal degree of indifference: there being no po&s;&s;ible way of expre&s;&s;ing our affection for God, but by regarding his revealed will. <Q>This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.</Q> Now, as our opponents mu&s;t allow, that their communities are liable to all tho&s;e other imperfections which are common to the real churches of Chri&s;t; &s;o, I pre|&s;ume, the reader will hardly forbear concluding, that free communion expo&s;es them to &s;ome <HI>additional</HI> di&s;|advantages, which are peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>

Thus kind and humble is modern charity.&mdash;In&s;tead of rejoicing in, or with the truth, it rejoiceth in contempla|ting the admirable piety that may be produced from &s;o many different, yea, oppo&s;ite principles.&mdash; It is very true, that the power of godline&s;s has oft|en &s;uffered in a zealous contention about rites and ceremonies; but the contention has been chiefly about forms of human device. The Chri&s;tians of old time were taught, not to <HI>di&s;pute</HI> about the in|&s;titutions of their Lord, but to <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> them thank|fully; and hereby they expre&s;&s;ed their affection to him and to each other. If that affection be grant|ed to be more important than the tokens of it, it would be unju&s;t to infer that the latter have no obligation; which would imply, that Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles <HI>meant nothing</HI> by their precepts. The Methodi&s;ts have not, indeed, gone &s;o far as their &s;piritual brethren [the Quakers] have done, in re|jecting all external ceremonies; but they are taught to believe, that all concern about the ancient or|der and cu&s;toms of the Chri&s;tians is mere party-&s;pirit, and injurious to the devout exerci&s;es of the heart. Thus the moder charity vaunts it&s;elf, in an&s;wering better purpo&s;es than could be accom|pli&s;hed by keeping the words of Chri&s;t.

Yet care &s;hould be taken, that her language be an echo to the voice of divine revelation; el&s;e you may neglect your duty and &s;light your privileges, offend God and injure your &s;oul, even while you obey her commands.&mdash; <Q>But I am per&s;uaded Chri&s;t has accepted me, and that it is my duty to receive the holy &s;upper.</Q> That Chri&s;t has received you, I have a plea&s;ing per&s;ua&s;ion; and &s;o I conclude, in a judgment of charity, concerning all whom I baptize: but that it is the <HI>immediate</HI> duty of any unbaptized be|liever to approach the Lord's table, may admit of a query: nay, the general practice of the Chri&s;tian church in every age, has been quite in the negative. For a learned writer a&s;&s;ures us, that <Q>among <HI>all the ab&s;urdities</HI> that ever were held, none ever maintain|ed <HI>that,</HI> that any per&s;on &s;hould partake of the com|munion before he was baptized.</Q> Was it, think you, the duty of an ancient I&s;raelite to wor&s;hip at the &s;anctuary, or to partake of the pa&s;chal &s;ea&s;t, before he was circumci&s;ed? Or, was it the duty of the Jew|i&s;h prie&s;ts to burn incen&s;e in the holy place, before they offered the morning or the evening &s;acrifice? The appointments of God mu&s;t be admini&s;tered in his own way, and in that order which he has fixed. For, to borrow an illu&s;tration from a well known author, <Q>Suppo&s;e a ma&s;ter commands his &s;ervant to
<PB N="135" REF="020976_0134_0FB20624A70C1BE8">&s;ow his ground; doth this give a right to him to go <HI>immediately</HI> and ca&s;t in the &s;eed, before that ever he break the ground with the plough, and make it fit for the receiving the &s;eed? Should he go thus to work, he were a di&s;obedient &s;ervant. Neither could it excu&s;e, that he had his ma&s;ter's immediate command to &s;ow his ground. Even &s;o in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Thomas Bo&s;ton's <HI>Works,</HI> page 386.</NOTE>&mdash;</Q> Chri&s;t commands believers to remem|ber him at his own table. But were tho&s;e believers to whom he fir&s;t gave the command <HI>unbaptized?</HI> Or, can we infer, becau&s;e it is the duty of all baptized believers to celebrate the Lord's &s;upper, that it is the <HI>immediate</HI> duty of one that is not baptized, &s;o to do? &mdash;<Q>Could you produce an in&s;tance from the records of the New Te&s;tament, of any believer being refu|&s;ed communion, merely becau&s;e he &s;crupled the propriety of being immer&s;ed on a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, it would warrant your pre&s;ent denial. But, when|ever you &s;hall make it appear, that a truly con|verted per&s;on, and one who was con&s;idered as &s;uch, de&s;ired fellow&s;hip with a church of Chri&s;t in the apo&s;tolic age: I will engage to prove that he was received, whatever might be his views relating to the mode and &s;ubject of bapti&s;m.</Q> And when you &s;hall adduce an in&s;tance of any real convert, in tho&s;e primitive times, con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupling the u&s;e of the wine at the Lord's table; I will enter under the &s;ame obligation to prove, that the &s;acred &s;upper was admini&s;tered to him in his own way.&mdash; <Q>Will you, then, dare to reject tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t accepts!</Q> Reject, from what? My e&s;teem and affection? Far be it! Under a per&s;ua&s;ion that Chri&s;t has received
<PB N="136" REF="020976_0135_0FB20626207DDB18">you, I love and honour you as a Chri&s;tian brother. His image appearing in your temper and conduct commands my regard.&mdash;<Q>With what con&s;i&s;|tency, then, can you refu&s;e me communion? If Chri&s;t has accepted me, if Chri&s;t him&s;elf has com|munion with me, why may not you?</Q> Commu|nion with you in the knowledge and comfort of the truth I have; and this would be both my honour and happine&s;s, were you a converted Jew. Commu|nion with you I al&s;o have in affection; but fellow|&s;hip at the Lord's table is a di&s;tinct act, a very dif|ferent thing; and is to be regulated entirely by the revealed will of Him that appointed it. Communion at the holy &s;upper would never have been either the duty or privilege of any man, if Chri&s;t had not com|manded it, any more than it is now my duty to ce|lebrate the ancient pa&s;&s;over. But that eternal law which requires me <Q>to love my neighbour as my|&s;elf,</Q> would have obliged me to love you, both as a man and a Chri&s;tian, if bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper had never been ordained.&mdash; <Q>After all, your profe&s;&s;ions of affection for me as a believer in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and your refu&s;ing to have communion with me at the holy table, carry the appearance of a &s;trong incon&s;i&s;tency.</Q> Admitting they do, the incon&s;i&s;tency is not peculiar to me, nor to tho&s;e of my per&s;ua&s;ion; becau&s;e I act on a principle received in common by the whole Chri&s;tian church. There is no denomination of Chri&s;tians, except tho&s;e who plead for free communion, that would admit you to the Lord's table, if they did not think you had been baptized. This, therefore, is the principle on which I refu&s;e to have communion with you: I con&s;ider you as unbaptized. Suppo&s;e a Jew, a Turk, or a Pagan, to be enlightened by divine grace, to have
<PB N="137" REF="020976_0136_0FB20628D00155F8">the truth as it is in Je&s;us, to love God and de&s;ire communion with his people before he is baptized; would you think it right, could your own con&s;cience admit of it, as con&s;i&s;tent with the revealed will of Chri&s;t and the practice of his apo&s;tles, that &s;uch a reque&s;t &s;hould be granted by any go&s;pel church? in a ca&s;e of this kind, I pre&s;ume,&mdash;and there have been millions of Jews and Heathens converted, &s;ince the Chri&s;tian aera commenced,&mdash;in &s;uch a ca&s;e you would ea&s;ily di&s;cern a con&s;i&s;tency, between loving him as a believer, and refu&s;ing to have communion with him till he was baptized. Nay, I cannot help thinking, but you would be &s;tartled at the report of any reli|gious community admitting &s;uch an one to the Lord's table; becau&s;e it would &s;trike you as a notorious de|parture from the divine rule of proceeding; from the laws and &s;tatutes of Heaven, in that ca&s;e made and provided. Be&s;ides, you have already acknow|ledged, that if you did not con&s;ider your&s;elf as bap|tized; if you thought immer&s;ion on a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m, which you very well know is <HI>my</HI> &s;entiment; you &s;hould think it your duty to &s;ubmit, you would not he&s;itate a moment. So that, were I to encourage your immediate approach to the &s;acred &s;upper, I &s;hould &s;tand condemned on your own principles. This, therefore, is the only que&s;ti|on between us, <HI>What is bapti&s;m?</HI> For you dare not a&s;&s;ert, you cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that an unbaptized be|liever, de&s;cended from Chri&s;tian parents, has any pre-eminence, in point of claim to communion, a|bove a truly converted Jew: and you mu&s;t allow that I have an equal right with you, or any other man, to judge for my&s;elf what is e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m. You verily believe that you have been baptized; I
<PB N="138" REF="020976_0137_0FB20629F1C58808">am equally confident, from your own account of the matter, that you have not. Your con&s;cience oppo|&s;es the thought of being immer&s;ed on a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, becau&s;e, in your opinion, it would be rebap|tization; mine cannot encourage your approach to the Lord's table, becau&s;e I con&s;ider infant bapti&s;m as invalid.&mdash; <Q>I perceive, then, that you look upon me as an unbaptized Heathen: for you cannot imagine that I am, or ever was, a Turk or a Jew.</Q> Quite a mi&s;take. I con&s;ider you as a real convert, and love you as a Chri&s;tian brother. Were you per|&s;uaded that a &s;on of Abraham after the fle&s;h, or a dupe to Mahomet's impo&s;ture, or an uncultivated Hottentot, had received the truth and was convert|ed to the Lord Redeemer; would you &s;till call him, without limitation, a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Heathen?</HI> No, candour and common &s;en&s;e would forbid the thought. You would rather &s;ay, He is a believer in God's Me&s;&s;iah, and a lover of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he feels the power of go&s;pel truth on his heart, and his moral conduct is comely; but, as yet, he is unbap|tized. I &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee him convinced of the importance of that in&s;titution, of the connection it has with other appointments of Chri&s;t, and behold him &s;ubmit to it. Then, were I in communion, I &s;hould freely give him the right hand of fellow&s;hip, and break bread with him at the Lord's table. Till then, however, though I think it the duty of every Chri&s;tian to love him for the truth's &s;ake, I con&s;ider it as no breach of charity, in any community, not to admit him to the Lord's table.&mdash;Now I appeal to the reader, I appeal to our brethren them&s;elves, Whether, on our Antipaedobapti&s;t principles, we are not obliged to con&s;ider a truly converted but unbap|tized
<PB N="139" REF="020976_0138_0FB2062B60E4BB08">Mu&s;&s;ulman, and a converted Engli&s;hman, who has has had no other than Paedobapti&s;m, as on a le|vel, in point of claim to communion with us? For God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. It is not matter where a man was born, or how he was educated; whether he drew his fir&s;t breath at Con&s;tantinople or Pekin, or London; whether his parents taught him to revere the Koran of Mahomet, the In&s;titutes of Confucius, or the well atte&s;ted Revelation of God; if he really be born of the Spirit, he has an equal claim to all the privileges of a go&s;pel church, with a true convert de&s;cended from Chri&s;tian ance&s;tors. And if &s;o, while our brethren abide by their pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, they could not refu&s;e the &s;acred &s;upper to the one, any more than the other, without the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency; though, by admitting the <HI>former</HI> to that divine appointment, they would &s;ur|pri&s;e and offend all that heard of it.</P>
<P>Our opponents further &s;ugge&s;t, nay, they &s;eem quite confident, <Q>That the Chri&s;tian Jews in the primitive church, might, on our principles, have refu&s;ed communion to the believing Gentiles, be|cau&s;e they were not circumci&s;ed; and that the con|verted Gentiles might have denied fellow&s;hip to the believing Jews, for the oppo&s;ite rea&s;on.</Q> But here our brethren take for granted, what we cannot by any means allow. For this way of talking &s;uppo&s;es, that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to bapti&s;m is no more demanded of believers now, than circumci&s;ion was of Gentile con|verts in the apo&s;tolic age; and that we who plead for bapti&s;m, as a term of communion, have no more authority &s;o to do, than Judaizing Chri&s;tians then had for maintaining the nece&s;&s;ity of circumci&s;ion. Now &s;uch extraordinary po&s;itions as the&s;e &s;hould not
<PB N="140" REF="020976_0139_0FB2062FE0DB0A90">have been a&s;&s;umed <HI>gratis,</HI> but <HI>proved, &s;oundly proved;</HI> which, had our oppo&s;ers well and truly performed, would have made me and many of their &s;tricter brethren, thorough pro&s;elytes to free communion. Nay, we &s;hould, probably, before now, have been in a hopeful way of getting <HI>entirely rid</HI> of that ordi|nance, about the order and importance of which we now contend. For neither Pacificus, nor Candidus, will dare to a&s;&s;ert, that our a&s;cended Lord requires <HI>any</HI> of his di&s;ciples to be circumci&s;ed, either before or after their admi&s;&s;ion to the holy table: con&s;e|quently, if their arguing from circumci&s;ion to bap|ti&s;m be conclu&s;ive, we may ab&s;olutely omit the lat|ter, as converts of old did the former, without fear of the lea&s;t offence, or of any divine re&s;entment.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t we, indeed, con&s;ider the admini&s;tration and the neglect of bapti&s;m, as on a perfect level with being circumci&s;ed, or uncircumci&s;ed, in the apo&s;tolic times! Mu&s;t an ordinance of the New Te&s;tament, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to which our Lord requires of all his di&s;ciples, be placed on the &s;ame footing with an ob&s;olete rite of the Jewi&s;h church! How kind it is of our brethren who po&s;&s;e&s;s this knowledge, and are &s;o well acquainted with Chri&s;tian liberty, relating to bapti&s;m, that they are willing to inform us of its true extent! For, as Socinus long ago ob&s;erved, <Q>Ignorance of it is the cau&s;e of <HI>many evils.</HI></Q> I may, however, venture an appeal to the intelligent reader, Whether this way of arguing does not much better become the pen of Socinus, of Volkelius, or of a Quaker; than that of Pacificus, of Candidus, or of any Bapti&s;t? Becau&s;e, as Hornbeek remarks, in an&s;wer to the Socinians; <Q>If is very ab&s;urd to explain the de&s;ign, the com|mand, and the obligation of bapti&s;m, by the abro|gation
<PB N="141" REF="020976_0140_0FB206334E718E38">and abu&s;e of circumci&s;ion.</Q> As our breth|ren dete&s;t the Socinian &s;y&s;tem in general, I cannot but wonder that they &s;hould &s;o often u&s;e weapons, in de&s;ence of their novel &s;entiment, that were forged by Socinus, or &s;ome of his pupils, for a &s;imilar pur|po&s;e. I could wi&s;h therefore, that &s;ome &s;uch per&s;on as Mr. Ryland, who is well known to have an utter aver&s;ion to the capital tenets of that pretended re|former of the Reformed church in Poland, would &s;e|riou&s;ly take Pacificus to ta&s;k, for paying &s;o much ho|nour to a depraver of divine truth, and a mutilator of God's wor&s;hip. For who knows but it might have a happy effect, and cau&s;e him to retract his <HI>Mo|de&s;t Plea?</HI>&mdash;Before I proceed to another objection. it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, What a <HI>variety</HI> of laudable and kindred purpo&s;es this argument is adapted to &s;erve, according to its various application by different per&s;ons. In the hands of our <HI>opponents,</HI> it effectually proves the nece&s;&s;ity of admitting infant &s;prinkling, in &s;ome ca&s;es, as a proper <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for what they con&s;ider as real bapti&s;m. From the pen of Socinus, it evinces beyond a doubt, that bapti&s;m is an <HI>indifferent thing.</HI> And in the mouth of Barclay, it will equally well demon&s;trate, that bapti&s;m &s;hould be <HI>entirely laid a&s;ide.</HI> Well, then, might our Candid and Peaceful oppo&s;ers congratulate them&s;elves on the &s;afety of their cau&s;e, it being defended by &s;uch a <HI>three edged</HI> &s;word as this! And well might they unite, at one man, in &s;aying: <Q>If, therefore, this were the <HI>only</HI> thing that could be urged in &s;avour of the latitude of communion I plead for, I &s;hould think it would be &s;ufficient; at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to excu&s;e our conduct, and &s;top the mouth of cen|&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="020976_0141_0FB206346B9783F0">
But, notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid, we &s;tand charged by our brethren with a <HI>notorious incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> in our own conduct; becau&s;e we occa&s;ionally admit, with plea&s;ure, Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters into our pul|pits, to whom we &s;hould refu&s;e communion at the Lord's table. This objection has been much in&s;i&s;ted upon of late, and is &s;ometimes urged again&s;t us by way of query, to the following effect. <Q>Is not as much required in order to an <HI>offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> in the church, as to <HI>private member&s;hip?</HI> Is it not as incon&s;i&s;tent to receive a Paedobapti&s;t, as a <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> and admit him into the <HI>pulpit,</HI> as to admit him into the <HI>church</HI> and to the <HI>Lord's table?</HI> Where have you either pre|cept, or example, for receiving them as <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> any more than for receiving them <HI>as members?</HI></Q>&mdash; The&s;e queries being con&s;idered, by many of our op|ponents, as quite unan&s;werable, I &s;hall take the more notice of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing then, that demands regard, is the &s;tate of the que&s;tion which is now before us. For it is not, as the&s;e queries &s;ugge&s;t, Whether as much be not required in order to an <HI>office</HI> in the church, as to <HI>private communion?</HI> This we readily allow; this we never denied. For what congregation of &s;trict Bap|ti&s;ts would think they acted con&s;i&s;tently in making choice of a Paedobapti&s;t for their pa&s;tor, or to offici|ate as a deacon? Be&s;ides, will not our brethren ac|knowledge, that in every orderly &s;ociety, and more e&s;pecially in a church of Chri&s;t, a per&s;on mu&s;t be a member before he can be an officer in it? <HI>This</HI> is the point in di&s;pute, at lea&s;t it is this about which I contend; Whether bapti&s;m be equally nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>occa&s;ional exerci&s;e</HI> of mini&s;terial gifts, as it is to
<PB N="143" REF="020976_0142_0FB20635F59E41E0"><HI>communion</HI> at the Lord's table? and, Whether the &s;cripture favour the one as much as the other?</P>
<P>Such being the true &s;tate of the que&s;tion, I now beg leave to a&s;k; Suppo&s;ing our brethren to prove the affirmative beyond a doubt, what is the con&s;e|quence, and how are we affected by it? Is it, that we are found guilty of a direct violation of &s;ome di|vine command, that <HI>requires</HI> us to receive Paedobap|ti&s;ts into our communion? No &s;uch thing is pretend|ed. Is it, that we oppo&s;e &s;ome plain apo&s;tolic <HI>prece|dent?</HI> neither is this laid to our charge. For they do not believe there were any Paedobapti&s;ts in the apo&s;tolic times; and, con&s;equently, they cannot &s;up|po&s;e that the New Te&s;tament contains an example of &s;uch being received into communion. What, then, is the conclu&s;ion they would infer? It mu&s;t, &s;urely, be &s;omething formidable to every &s;trict Bapti&s;t; otherwi&s;e it is hardly &s;uppo&s;able that &s;o much weight &s;hould be laid upon this objection. The con&s;equence, however, is only this; The premi&s;es proved, <HI>the &s;trict Bapti&s;ts have no rea&s;on to cen&s;ure their brethren of a loo&s;er ca&s;t, becau&s;e they them&s;elves are equally culpable, though in a different re&s;pect.</HI> Or, in other words. <HI>The &s;trict Bap|ti&s;ts, like &s;ome other folks, are not quite infallible; do ac|tually err; and, by rea&s;on of a mi&s;take, impertinently blame the conduct of their more free, and open, and gene|rous brethren, when they ought rather to examine and re|form their own.</HI>&mdash;But this inference can be of little &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of free communion, except it be good logic and &s;ound divinity, to attempt a ju&s;tifi|cation of my own faults, by proving that he who ac|cu&s;es me is equally guilty: or to congratulate my|&s;elf as an innocent man, becau&s;e my neighbour can|not with a good grace reprove me. Our opponents,
<PB N="144" REF="020976_0143_0FB206376E46EC80">I per&s;uade my&s;elf, will not be greatly offended with us, if this argument, <HI>Herculean</HI> as it &s;eems to them; &s;hould not make us complete converts to free commu|nion. So &s;oon, however, as our brethren &s;hall make it appear, that they have as good a warrant for re|ceiving Paedobapti&s;t believers into &s;tated communi|on, as I have to admit a Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ter occa|&s;ionally into my pulpit; I will either <HI>encourage</HI> the former, or <HI>entirely refu&s;e</HI> the latter.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e queries prove any thing, they prove too much; more at lea&s;t, than the queri&s;ts intend. For, according to the argument contained in them, it is equally unwarrantable for us to <HI>hear</HI> a Paedo|babti&s;t mini&s;ter preach, or to <HI>unite with him</HI> in pub|blic prayer; as it is for them to receive him into communion. For in&s;tance: do they demand, <Q>Where have you either precept, or example, for admitting Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters into your pulpits, any more than for receiving them as members?</Q> I re&s;ort, on their Bapti&s;t principles; Where have you either precept or example, in the New Te&s;tament, for <HI>bearing</HI> Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters preach; or for <HI>uniting with them</HI> in public prayer, any more than for re|ceiving them as members? And, to &s;hew the futili|ty of this argument, I again demand; If, in <HI>bearing</HI> &s;uch mini&s;ters preach, or by <HI>uniting with them</HI> in pub|lic prayer (which are undoubtedly branches of the <HI>moral</HI> wor&s;hip of God, nor peculiar to any di&s;pen&s;a|tion of religion) we act without any expre&s;s com|mand or plain example in the New Te&s;tament; with what propriety, can we blame our brethren for ad|mitting. Paedobapti&s;ts to the Lord's &s;upper (which is a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> in&s;titution; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> part of divine wor&s;hip that depends entirely on a <HI>revelation</HI> of the &s;overeign will
<PB N="145" REF="020976_0144_0FB2063CE24F5EF8">of God) though they have neither precept nor pre|cedent for &s;o doing? Queries of this kind might be multiplied, but the&s;e may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>But is there <HI>no</HI> difference between the two ca&s;es? <HI>No</HI> difference between occa&s;ionally admitting Paedo|bapti&s;t mini&s;ters into our pulpits, and receiving them, or others of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion, into our communion? I can &s;carcely imagine that our breth|ren them&s;elves will here an&s;wer in the negative; but that this difference may plainly appear, let the fol|lowing things be ob&s;erved.&mdash;Public preaching is not confined to per&s;ons in a <HI>church &s;tate,</HI> nor ever was; but the Lord's &s;upper is a church ordinance, nor ought ever to be admini&s;tered but to a particular church, <HI>as &s;uch.</HI> Now it is of a particular church, and of a po&s;itive ordinance peculiar to it, concerning which is all our di&s;pute.&mdash;There is not that &s;trict mutual relation between bare hearers of the word and their preachers, as there is between the members of a church and her pa&s;tor, or between the members them&s;elves. And as, according to the appointment of God, per&s;ons mu&s;t <HI>believe</HI> the go&s;pel before they have any thing to do with po&s;itive in&s;titutions; &s;o, in the ordinary cour&s;e of Providence, they mu&s;t <HI>hear</HI> the go&s;pel in order to their believing. The Corin|thians <HI>heard</HI> before they <HI>believed;</HI> they believed be|fore they were <HI>baptized;</HI> and, no doubt, they were baptized before they received the <HI>&s;acred &s;upper.</HI> (Acts xviii. 8.) When our opponents receive Paedobapti&s;ts into their fellow&s;hip, they practically allow what they them&s;elves con&s;ider as a human invention, to &s;uper&s;ede a po&s;itive, divine in&s;titution; and that with a view to their attending on another po&s;itive appointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Not &s;o, when we ad|mit

There is, undoubtedly, a material difference, between hearing a mini&s;ter who, in our judgment, is igno|rant of the only true bapti&s;m, di&s;cour&s;e on tho&s;e doctrines he experimentally knows, and countenanc|ing an invention of men.

<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, as a fact, that per|&s;ons have been called by grace, who were not bap|tized in their infancy; and, con&s;idering bapti&s;m as a temporary in&s;titution, have con&s;cientiou&s;ly refu&s;ed a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that ordinance when converted, who yet de&s;ired communion in the holy &s;upper.

Now, on either of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, I demand of our brethren, whether they would receive &s;uch an one into communion with the &s;ame readine&s;s that they would admit him into their pulpits? If they an&s;wer in the negative, then by their own confe&s;|&s;ion, there is not &s;o clo&s;e a connection between ad|mitting a per&s;on to preach among&s;t us, and receiving him into communion, as they pretend.

Yes, the New Te&s;ta|ment not only <HI>permits,</HI> as lawful, but <HI>enjoins</HI> as an in|di&s;pen&s;able duty, that we &s;hould love them that love the Lord; and that we &s;hould manife&s;t his holy af|fection in every way, that is not incon&s;i&s;tent with a revelation of the divine will in &s;ome other re&s;pect.

To admit, therefore, a mini&s;ter to preach among us, with whom we &s;hould have no objection to com|mune, could we allow the validity of infant bap|ti&s;m; as it is a token of our affection for a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, of our love to the truth he preaches, and is not contrary to any part of divine revelation, mu&s;t be lawful: or if not, it lies with our brethren to prove it; becau&s;e they cannot deny that the word of God requires us to love him, and to manife&s;t our affection for him. But as to communion at the holy table, Chri&s;tians in general have had no more doubt, whether bapti&s;m &s;hould <HI>precede</HI> it, according to a &s;pecial revelation of the divine will; than whether bapti&s;m it&s;elf be a part of the coun&s;el of God.&mdash; When we a&s;k a Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ter to preach in any of our churches, we act on the &s;ame general principle, as when we reque&s;t him to pray with any of us in a private family.

<P>I take it for granted, that circumci&s;ion was ab&s;o|lutely

This, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, our opponents mu&s;t allow: this, I think, they dare not deny. Yet if Enoch, for in&s;tance, had been in the camp of I&s;rael when Korah and his company mutinied, and had been di&s;po&s;ed to give the rebels a lecture on the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t; I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that his offered &s;ervice would have been re|jected by Mo&s;es or Jo&s;hua, merely becau&s;e he was not circumci&s;ed.

Ezek. xliv. 7.) If this be allowed, the con&s;equence is plain, and the argument, though analogical, is irrefragable. For the Pa&s;|chal fea&s;t and the &s;anctuary &s;ervices were not more of a po&s;itive nature than the Lord's &s;upper; nor were the former more peculiar to that di&s;pen&s;ation than the latter is to this; but preacing and hear|ing the word are not peculiar to any di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, as are bapti&s;m and the &s;acred &s;upper.</P>
<P>Our Lord, though he warned his hearers again&s;t the pride and hypocri&s;y, the unbelief and covetou&s;|ne&s;s, of the ancient Phari&s;ees, and Scribes, and Jew|i&s;h teachers; yet exhorted the people to regard the truths they delivered.

(Acts. x. 44.) Nor is it improbable but &s;ome of them then received gifts for the mini&s;try; and if &s;o, in the ful|ne&s;s of their hearts and the tran&s;port of their joy, they al&s;o gave the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of their future mi|ni&s;trations, to the plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment of Peter and tho&s;e that were with him. But can our brethren &s;uppo&s;e, that the great apo&s;tle would have taken equal plea&s;ure in hearing them reque&s;t a place at the Lord's table, before they were baptized? No; his own conduct oppo&s;es the thought.

<P>Once more: A very competent judge of all that pertains to the mini&s;terial character, and of all that belongs to a Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, has left his opinion on record concerning the mini&s;try of certain per&s;ons, whom he con&s;idered as quite unworthy of his inti|mate friend&s;hip. Yes, Paul, that mo&s;t excellent man,

<P>Mr. Daniel Turner has al&s;o borne his te&s;timony to the u&s;efulne&s;s and importance of bapti&s;m. For, &s;peaking of that ordinance, he &s;ays: <Q>Chri&s;t him|&s;elf &s;ubmitted to this rite, as admini&s;tered by John; not indeed with the &s;ame views, or to the &s;ame ends, with others; but as pointing out by his ex|ample, <HI>the duty of Chri&s;tians in general.</HI> He al&s;o gave his mini&s;ters a commi&s;&s;ion and order, to bap|tize all the nations they taught.&mdash;It appears that

<P>After &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e, relating to the va&s;t utility and grand importance of bapti&s;m, one cannot but wonder at Pacificus, Candidus, and o|thers of our opponents that were never &s;u&s;pected of Antitrinitarian error; calling that ordinance, a <HI>non-e&s;&s;ential,</HI> an <HI>external rite,</HI> an <HI>indifferent thing,</HI> a <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> a <HI>mere outward form;</HI> comparing it with <HI>the antiqua|ted rite of circumci&s;ion,</HI> in the apo&s;tolic age. How different this way of talking from the quotations I have ju&s;t produced; e&s;pecially tho&s;e I have taken
<PB N="162" REF="020976_0161_0FB20668D0C07B90">from pieces that were either publi&s;hed, or compo&s;ed and recommended, by my worthy friend Mr. Ry|land! For he looks upon bapti&s;m, in connection with the Lord's &s;upper, as of <HI>un&s;peakable importance</HI> to the glory of God, and the very being of a true church upon earth. He in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that bapti&s;m demands the believer's regard, <HI>prior</HI> to the holy &s;up|per, as it was appointed to be fir&s;t admini&s;tered: and he &s;everely cen&s;ures tho&s;e <HI>incon&s;iderate mortals,</HI> who treat the ordinance lightly.&mdash;Mr. Turner al&s;o, as we have &s;een, maintains that bapti&s;m is <HI>the duty of Chri&s;tians in general;</HI> that it is the <HI>common token</HI> of our &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t; that it is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to a regu|lar entrance</HI> into the vi&s;ible church; and that it is the <HI>foundation</HI> of external communion in the hou&s;e of God. Surely, then, the&s;e authors cannot but be greatly grieved, if not offended, which tho&s;e diluting terms and that degrading compari&s;on, which are u&s;ed by Me&s;&s;ieurs Pacificus and Candidus, when &s;peaking of the ordinance! Nay, they will be ready to retort upon them that heavy charge, with tho&s;e <HI>Peaceful</HI> and <HI>Candid</HI> Gentlemen levelled at us; and to remind them that, by treating bapti&s;m in &s;uch a manner, they greatly injure <Q>the honour and inter|e&s;t of true religion, and not a little contribute to the cau&s;e of infidelity.</Q> For they have united in repeatedly calling bapti&s;m <HI>a non-e&s;&s;ential;</HI> and in com|paring it with that ob&s;olete appointment <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> of which judaizing Chri&s;tians of old were &s;o fond. This being the ca&s;e, I am heartily glad that the&s;e worthy authors have <HI>reprobated</HI> their conduct, and &s;o <HI>publicly condemned</HI> their way of thinking, in regard to bapti&s;m. It may &s;erve, perhaps, as an antidote again&s;t the hurtful influence of their <HI>Mode&s;t Plea;</HI>

For as their names are, <HI>Candid</HI> and <HI>Peaceful,</HI> &s;o is their temper; and it might have a beneficial effect, by making them more careful what they write and publi&s;h in future, in regard to free communion.&mdash;But I return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VI.</HI> Reflections on the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character, <HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts,</HI> which our Brethren apply to us.</HEAD>
<P>OUR opponents, I ob&s;erve, repeatedly call us, <HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts;</HI> but whether for &s;o doing they merit commendation, or de&s;erve cen&s;ure, may, per|haps, be a que&s;tion with &s;ome. If, by the epithet
<PB N="171" REF="020976_0170_0FB2067C61693CE8"><HI>&s;trict,</HI> they mean <HI>exact, accurate, con&s;cientiou&s;ly nice;</HI> their candour de&s;erves commendation. In that &s;en&s;e of the term we are not a&s;hamed to be called <HI>Strict, Bapti&s;ts;</HI> we cheerfully adopt the character.</P>
<P>It may, however, admit of a query, whether we be &s;o fully entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s this honour without a rival, as our brethren &s;eem to in&s;inuate. Is it be|cau&s;e we are &s;tricter than the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> in regard to communion at the Lord's table? That remains to be proved. Is it becau&s;e we con&s;ider bapti&s;m as equally the duty of <HI>all</HI> believers? This, indeed, we maintain: and the rea&s;on is, tho&s;e arguments which prove it the duty of one, will apply to all. Or, is it becau&s;e we con&s;ider bapti&s;m as <HI>a term</HI> of commu|nion? We, it is true, avow the &s;entiment; but it is far from being peculiar to us. For it appears from the foregoing pages, that we act on a principle re|ceived in common by Chri&s;tians of almo&s;t every name, in every age, and in every nation. When, therefore, we are compared with profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;|tians in general, we have no peculiar claim to the epithet <HI>&s;trict;</HI> whatever right we may have to the denomination of <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> or whatever be our di&s;|tingui&s;hing character, when oppo&s;ed to our brethren with whom we now contend.&mdash;Nor can we be other|wi&s;e than <HI>&s;trict,</HI> without violating our own prin|ciples, and contradicting our own practice. For <HI>we</HI> believe that all who have received the truth, &s;hould profe&s;s their faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t and be baptized. And have we not the happine&s;s, in this re&s;pect, of agreeing with our brethren? When we made a pub|lic declaration of our dependence on Chri&s;t, and gave a rea&s;on of the hope that is in us, we believed it was <HI>our</HI> duty to be baptized, before we received the &s;a|cred
<PB N="172" REF="020976_0171_0FB20681835FFF98" MS="y">&s;upper. Did not our opponents do the &s;ame? or had it no place at all in their creed? In con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a conviction, <HI>we</HI> were actually immer|&s;ed in the name of the Lord, before we approached the holy table. And were not they al&s;o? But how came it to be either <HI>our</HI> duty, or <HI>theirs,</HI> thus to pro|ceed? Was it becau&s;e they or we <HI>believed</HI> that it was required of us? Or, did a full per&s;ua&s;ion of this kind con&s;titute that <HI>a duty,</HI> which would no other|wi&s;e have been obligatory? If &s;o, a Catholic may lawfully adore the ho&s;t, a Mu&s;&s;ulman revere Maho|met, and a Jew bla&s;pheme the Me&s;&s;iah. No; that which made it our duty to be baptized, and then to receive the Lord's &s;upper, was <HI>the command of God;</HI> which lies on every per&s;on &s;o qualified, by the re|newing agency of the divine Spirit, as we humbly conceived our&s;elves to be. Now, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that this command extends to none but tho&s;e among real converts, who feel its force on their own con|&s;ciences? Or, may we &s;afely conclude, that a be|liever is no further obliged by any divine precept, or prohibition, than he <HI>&s;ees</HI> and <HI>acknowledges</HI> the obliga|tion, in regard to him&s;elf? If &s;o, a believer who has been baptized, may live all his days in the neglect of communion at the Lord's table, and &s;tand acquit|ted of blame; and covetou&s;ne&s;s is no crime, in thou|&s;ands who bow at the &s;hrine of Mammon; for there are comparatively few lovers of money, who ac|knowledge their guilt in that re&s;pect. Nay, on this principle it will follow, that the more ignorant any believer is, and the le&s;s tender his con&s;cience, he is under &s;o much the le&s;s obligation to obey the divine commands. But the reader will do well to remem|ber, that the <HI>Great Supreme</HI> do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> not lie at our cour|te&s;y
<PB N="173" REF="020976_0172_0FB2068540419CE0" MS="y">for his claim of obedience upon us, in any in&s;tance that can be named. No; it is not our <HI>conviction</HI> of the propriety, the utility, or the nece&s;&s;ity of any command which he has given, that entitles him to the performance of it; but, in all things of a moral nature, our being <HI>rational creatures</HI> is the ground of his claim; and in tho&s;e of a po&s;itive kind, our <HI>being qualified</HI> according to his direction, whether we be &s;o wi&s;e and &s;o &s;incere as to acknowledge the obligation, or no. Thus it appears that the epithet <HI>&s;trict,</HI> if taken in the &s;en&s;e already explained, is no di&s;honour to us.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, our brethren mean by the epithet, that we are <HI>bigotted, unnece&s;&s;arily exact, un|&s;cripturally confined;</HI> their forwardne&s;s to give us a name calls for our cen&s;ure. In the former &s;en&s;e, I will venture to affirm, every Bapti&s;t <HI>ought</HI> to be a <HI>&s;trict</HI> one, or el&s;e to renounce the name. In the lat|ter u&s;e of the term, we reject the di&s;tingui&s;hing epi|thet, and require our opponents to prove&mdash;I &s;ay to <HI>prove,</HI> not to &s;urmi&s;e, that it ju&s;tly belongs to us. And that they u&s;e the word in this <HI>obnoxious</HI> meaning appears to me, by the tenor of their arguing; by &s;uperadding that har&s;her epithet <HI>rigorous;</HI> and by that home charge, of greatly injuring <Q>the honour and intere&s;t of true religion, and <HI>not a little contributing to the cau&s;e of infidelity?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But if we be <HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts,</HI> what are they? Our brethren will not be offended, if I again a&s;k, What <HI>are</HI> they; and by <HI>what name</HI> &s;hall we call them? That they are not <HI>&s;trict</HI> Bapti&s;ts, is out of all di&s;pute; be|cau&s;e from &s;uch they expre&s;sly di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and have abundant rea&s;on, if the charge ju&s;t menti|oned be true, to be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of them. I am obliged,
<PB N="174" REF="020976_0173_0FB2068624D48338">therefore, if it be lawful for me to imitate their of|ficiou&s;ne&s;s, and to give them a name, (for as yet they are <HI>half</HI> anonymous) to &s;earch for &s;ome &s;ignificant and de&s;criptive adjective, that will &s;et them at a <HI>wide di&s;tance</HI> from the &s;trict Bapti&s;ts. But what mu&s;t it be? <HI>Innaccurate,</HI> or <HI>loo&s;e,</HI> or <HI>latitudinarian?</HI> I would not, de|&s;ignedly, be guilty of a mi&s;nomer; but as all the&s;e terms are very different in their meaning from that obnoxious word <HI>&s;trict,</HI> it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that. I am far from the truth. As they profe&s;s them|&s;elves <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> there we agree; but as they hold the ordinance of bapti&s;m with a <HI>loo&s;e hand,</HI> there we dif|fer; and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch oppo&s;itely &s;igni|ficant epithets, to mark our different conduct. For names, you know, are &s;o much the more perfect, by how much the more they expre&s;s the nature and properties of per&s;ons and things. Yes, the practice of our opponents makes it evident to all the world, that the term <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> when applied to them, is to be under&s;tood in &s;uch a latitude of &s;ignification, as will comport with receiving per&s;ons to communi|on, who, in their judgment, are <HI>unbaptized.</HI> That is, they are <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> when the ideas expre&s;&s;ed by that name &s;uit the di&s;po&s;itions of their hearers; and they entirely omit the ordinance, from which they take their denomination, when candidates for communion with them do not approve of it. And, which makes their conduct, in this re&s;pect, appear exceedingly &s;trange, they do not, like his Holine&s;s of Rome, expre&s;sly claim a di&s;pen&s;ing power; nor, in the madne&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m, pretend to any new revelation; nor yet, with the di&s;ciples of George Rox, confider bapti&s;m as a temporary in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Our character, then, is fixed. Their own pens
<PB N="175" REF="020976_0174_0FB20687A657F6B8">have engro&s;&s;ed it. And, be it known to all men, we are <HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts.</HI> To this character, as before ex|plained, we &s;ub&s;cribe with hand and heart; in the la&s;t words of the celebrated Father Paul, <HI>E&s;to perpe|tua.</HI> Theirs I have attempted to draw, in contra&s;t with ours, and will now venture to call them, <HI>Lati|tudinarian Bapti&s;ts.</HI> Whether they will allow the name to be ju&s;t, and e&s;teem it as we do ours, I am not certain. But of this I make no doubt, that the religious world in general, were they to &s;ee and com|pare it with the opinion and practice of our brethren; would pronounce it de&s;criptive of the per&s;ons to whom it is given. <HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts</HI>&mdash;they will permit our cha|racter to &s;tand fir&s;t, as it has confe&s;&s;edly the right of primogeniture&mdash;<HI>Strict Bapti&s;ts! Latitudinarian Bap|ti&s;ts!</HI> The&s;e characters, in contra&s;t, &s;ound very oddly, I mu&s;t confe&s;s; and they are but of a novel date. For they do not appear to have had an exi&s;tence till about the middle of the la&s;t century. What a pity it is but &s;omething of a &s;imilar kind could have been found, in the ancient monuments of the Jewi&s;h church, relating to circumci&s;ion, as a prerequi&s;ite for communion in it. Had it appeared, in any authentic records, that the &s;ons of Abraham, in times of yore, were divided in their judgment about that ob&s;olete rite; and that &s;ome of them were called <HI>Strict Cir|cumci&s;ioni&s;ts,</HI> and others <HI>Latitudinarian Circumci&s;ioni&s;ts;</HI> it would have given, at lea&s;t, an <HI>air</HI> of antiquity to our brethren's hypothe&s;is, practice, and character. But&mdash;we mu&s;t take things as we find them.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t now recollect, what many of my readers mu&s;t know to be fact, that our Paedobapti&s;t brethren, when they have a mind to &s;hew their wit and be a little merry at our expence, repre&s;ent the Bapti&s;ts,
<PB N="176" REF="020976_0175_0FB20689C1231788">without di&s;tinction, as <HI>exceedingly fond</HI> of water; as profe&s;&s;ors that cannot <HI>live</HI> in a church &s;tate, without <HI>a great deal of water.</HI> Nay, one of them has very politely called us <HI>'watery Bigots;'</HI> and then adds, <Q>Many ignorant &s;prinkled Chri&s;tians are often, to their hurt, <HI>pulled by them into the water.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mayo's <HI>True Scripture Doctrine of Bapti&s;m,</HI> p. 33. Poor creatures! How much the&s;e <Q>&s;prinkled Chri&s;tians</Q> are to be pitied, when treated &s;o rudely by <HI>watery bigots!</HI> Is there no remedy again&s;t &s;uch an inva&s;ion of per&s;onal liberty, by appealing to Cae&s;ar? If there be, a <HI>Doctor of Laws</HI> would not &s;pend his time ill in pointing it out, for the benefit of &s;uch '<HI>ignorant</HI> &s;prinkled Chri&s;tians,' and to prevent any of them being <HI>hurt,</HI> in future.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;Accor|ding to this Gentleman, then, we are <HI>watery bigots.</HI> Well, it does not greatly di&s;tre&s;s <HI>me</HI> to be thus repre|&s;ented by a &s;neering antagoni&s;t; becau&s;e I really be|lieve that <HI>much water</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to bapti&s;m, and am no le&s;s confident, that bapti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary to com|munion at the Lord's table. But &s;ince I have maturely con&s;idered the &s;ingular character and peculiar &s;ituation of our latitudinarian brethren, I can by no means think it either candid or equitable that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be thus repre&s;ented. Becau&s;e it is evident, evident even to demon&s;tration, that their profe&s;&s;ion and practice taken together will not admit of it. They, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, will &s;ometimes declaim aloud on the nece&s;&s;ity of a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, and of immer&s;ion in the name of the triune God, to con&s;titute that bapti&s;m which is from heaven. So, when they write on the &s;ubject, and publi&s;h their thoughts to the
<PB N="177" REF="020976_0176_0FB2068C5F4C2178">world at large, they a&s;&s;ert the&s;e things with the grea|te&s;t confidence. They will al&s;o, with the venerable John, go down into Jordan, and there admini&s;ter the &s;ignificant ordinance: &s;o that one would be tempted to think they were <HI>&s;trict</HI> Bapti&s;ts, <HI>real</HI> Bapti&s;ts, and that Bapti&s;m has no <HI>fa&s;ter friends</HI> upon earth. But when they plead for free communion, they <HI>talk</HI> a dif|ferent language; they &s;peak of it as an indifferent thing and a mere trifle, that is not worth contending about. And, when they admit communicants, they often <HI>act</HI> in a different way; for, in receiving a Pae|dohapti&s;t, what they con&s;ider as real bapti&s;m is en|tirely &s;et a&s;ide. They might, con&s;equently, with equal con&s;i&s;tency, admit believers to their commu|nion, who have neither been immer&s;ed nor &s;prinkled; and &s;o, like the Quakers, have nothing at all to do with <HI>water</HI> in the wor&s;hip of God. Whether, there|fore, a per&s;on has been immer&s;ed in a river, be the waters ever &s;o <HI>many;</HI> or &s;prinkled with that element from the palm of the hand, be the drops ever &s;o <HI>few;</HI> or has had no concern with water <HI>at all,</HI> it makes no material difference with them, in point of communi|on. So, then, as they can receive members into their communities, &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a church &s;tate, and en|joy fellow&s;hip at the Lord's table, with either <HI>much</HI> water, or <HI>little</HI> water, or <HI>none at all;</HI> I humbly con|ceive, that if our bantering opponent would do them ju&s;tice, while he di&s;plays his own wit, he &s;hould give them a <HI>different name.</HI> For though they &s;eem, at &s;ometimes, to be as fond of water as we are; in|&s;i&s;ting upon it, that where there is no immer&s;ion there is no bapti&s;m; yet, at others, they warm|ly contend, that believers of <HI>all</HI> denominations, (i. e. Bapti&s;ts with <HI>much</HI> water; Paedobapti&s;ts, with <HI>little</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="020976_0177_0FB20691A99658D8">water; and Katabapti&s;ts without <HI>any water</HI> at all) have a right of communion with them in the &s;acred &s;upper. It behoves the Doctor, therefore, if ever he favour us with another addre&s;s, to &s;earch for a new di&s;tingui&s;hing epithet, to connect with the term <HI>bigots,</HI> that &s;hall include and expre&s;s the&s;e vari|ous ideas. But whether our own language be able to furni&s;h an adjective comprehen&s;ive enough, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, I dare not a&s;&s;ert: very probably, however, among tho&s;e numerous compounds con|tained in the language of ancient Greece, he may find one that is fit for the purpo&s;e. And as it is not every one, no, nor every Doctor, who could have thought of that elegant phra&s;e, <HI>'Watery Bigots;'</HI> I doubt not the fertility of his invention, and the well known accuracy of his pen, when handling the Bap|ti&s;ts, will enable him to give our brethren a de&s;crip|tive character, that &s;hall be equally polite and per|fectly &s;uitable.</P>
<P>Though I am far from &s;u&s;pecting that our breth|ren want &s;incerity, or from thinking that they violate the dictates of con&s;cience, in maintaining their very &s;ingular hypothe&s;is; yet their conduct, in regard to bapti&s;m, has &s;uch an <HI>ambiguous</HI> appearance, and looks &s;o much like holding <HI>both &s;ides</HI> of a contradiction, that I &s;hould not wonder if one or another of our Paedobap|ti&s;t opponents, were to apply them with a little alte|ration, the &s;pirited remon&s;trance of Bp. Hall to Abp. Laud. The latter being &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of a pre|dilection for Popery, and the former intending to deal roundly with him on that &s;ubject, addre&s;&s;ed him in the following language. <Q>I would I knew where to find you&mdash;To day you are in the tents of the Romani&s;ts; to morrow in ours; the next day be|tween

Heat and cold have their u&s;es; luke|warmne&s;s is good for nothing but to trouble the &s;tomach&mdash;How long will you halt in this indiffer|ency? Re&s;olve one way, and know, at la&s;t, what you do hold; what you &s;hould. Ca&s;t off either your wings or your teeth; and, loathing this bat-like form, be either a bird or a bea&s;t. If you mu&s;t be|gin, why not now?&mdash;God crieth with Jehu, <HI>Who is on my &s;ide, who?</HI>&mdash;Take you <HI>peace;</HI> let me have <HI>truth,</HI> if I cannot have both.</Q> * Thus the acute and good Bi&s;hop Hall, to one who halted between two opinions; who was neither an uniform Papi&s;t, nor a con&s;i&s;tent Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>And now, before I conclude, our brethren will &s;uffer me al&s;o to remon&s;trate; and the reader may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I do it without the lea&s;t impeach|ment of their integrity; If infant &s;prinkling be a hu|man invention, di&s;own it, renounce it, entirely re|ject it, and no longer let it hold the place of a divine in&s;titution in any of your churches. But if it be from Heaven, embrace it, profe&s;s it, practi&s;e it in the face of the &s;un, and lay the other ab&s;olutely a&s;ide, as de&s;titute of a divine warrant. For as there is but <HI>one God,</HI> and <HI>one faith,</HI> &s;o there is but <HI>one bapti&s;m.</HI> Divine truth is con&s;i&s;tent; divine ordinances are con|&s;i&s;tent, for they are not yea and nay; and all the Chri&s;tian world are con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, rela|ting to bapti&s;m; be ye, therefore, con&s;i&s;tent, in this, as you are in other re&s;pects. That is, be either con|&s;i&s;tent <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Paedobapti&s;ts;</HI> for, according to your pre&s;ent practice, all thinking and impartial men mu&s;t pronounce you an <HI>heterogeneous mixture</HI> of both.</P>
