<P>IT is to be lamented, that in this country, few pens have been devoted to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. In remarking this, I do not con&s;ider the numerous pamphlets and &s;ermons, which have appeared, &s;o far as the de&s;ign of them was, to extend the character of the writers, or to &s;upport &s;ome &s;ide of a theological di&s;pute. Whatever is not addre&s;&s;ed to the heart-will never reach the &s;eat of Religion.</P>
<P>The following is de&s;igned to explore the arts of infidels; to trace the op|erations of the Spirit of God; to open the leading doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and to extend the Redeemer's kingdom. It may be read by the learned and the ignorant; may be u&s;eful to the gay and the &s;erious, and equally plea&s;|ing to the young and old.</P>
<P>As the time and place of <HI>Clio's</HI> death, are among the unintere&s;ting parts of his hi&s;tory, I have not noticed them; and in my connexion, have thrown in only tho&s;e facts, which his own manu&s;cript left untold.</P>

<HEAD>MARTIN<HI>'s HISTORY OF</HI> CLIO.</HEAD>
<P>_CLIO was indebted to Nature, for feelings, exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible to all the occurrences of life. His pul&s;e beat high with joy, when he &s;aw his friends in pro&s;perity, and tears flowed in &s;treams from his eyes, when he attended &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>To education, he owed a cultivated mind, and to a knowledge of the world, an accurate acquaint|ance with the hearts of men. Though he delight|ed to &s;hed the &s;ecret tear; though he preferred the hou&s;e of mourning to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting; though he indulged rather in that &s;orrow, which makes the heart better, than in the laughter of fools; yet he was more often found among the gay, than the gloomy.</P>
<P>This proceeded, not from levity, but from a cer|tain refinement of &s;oul, which taught him to avoid &s;cenes of woe, where he might betray a feeling heart, and expo&s;e a flowing eye to &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;neers and ridi|cule. With me, his only bo&s;om friend, has he &s;pent many hours; and has often, from motives of deli|cacy, waved &s;ubjects mo&s;t near to his heart, fearing to give me pain: but he was as ignorant of my heart,
<PB N="6" REF="023207_0005_0FBE7FC4C7A03D70">as the world was of his; for how often would I gladly have mingled my tears with his tears, and have paid an united tribute to the dignity of human nature; but tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;cenes are pa&s;t; never to return.</P>
<P>To an excellent family education Clio was in|debted for an early acquaintance with the Chri&s;tian religion. His parents were the faithful &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and taught their children <HI>to re|member their Creator in the days of their youth,</HI> and to believe the great truths of the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>No pains nor expen&s;e were &s;pared to give Clio the be&s;t education, which his country could afford. He was de&s;igned for the &s;acred work of the mini&s;|try, and his father was re&s;olved not to add to the number of blind guides, who, ignorant them&s;elves, pre&s;ume to in&s;truct the world.</P>
<P>Though Clio's heart was uncorrupted, though <HI>within</HI> he was pen&s;ive and &s;erious; yet <HI>without</HI> he had a certain air of gaiety and volatility, which, however innocent, had almo&s;t proved his ruin: So nece&s;&s;ary is it, that the manners and the heart be congenial. Though idlers, triflers and fools were always Clio's abhorrence; yet there was a kind of company, with whom he a&s;&s;ociated, more danger|ous than them all. The&s;e were &s;ubtle rea&s;oners, who&s;e heads are warm; but who&s;e hearts are cold; full of &s;entiment; but void of &s;en&s;ibility. OF SUCH CHARACTERS, MY YOUNG FRIENDS, BEWARE!</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ubtle a&s;&s;ociates would often ridicule the duties of Chri&s;tianity; would call the religion of the New Te&s;tament, a &s;cheme, ju&s;t calculated for people of weak minds; would &s;ay, that revelation had no &s;upport but fanatici&s;m; and that if the clergy were not intere&s;ted in its promotion, it would fall to the ground. The train was artfully laid;
<PB N="7" REF="023207_0006_0FBE7FC5EA998098">for Clio, jealous of his character as a &s;cholar, was unwilling to be ranked among fools and fanatics.</P>
<P>He began to hear with apparent plea&s;ure, of cel|ebrated dei&s;ts, and was once per&s;uaded to toa&s;t the names of Hume, Voltaire, Bolingbroke and Chubb.</P>
<P>He was young, therefore we are not to wonder, that with him, rea&s;onings, <HI>of which men would have been a&s;hamed,</HI> had an influence. He was per&s;uaded to read the writings of unbelievers, to the neglect of his &s;tudies, and even of his bible, which, till this, he had never omitted, morning nor evening.</P>
<P>His heart often reproved him, con&s;cience beat frequent alarms; but, the PRIDE OF SCIENCE pre|vailed, and he began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, with his borrowed arguments, as a mo&s;t penetrating ca&s;ui&s;t.</P>
<P>To my readers, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to remark on the delicate and minute &s;prings of the mind. None was more ea&s;ily put into operation, than Clio's. He was on the verge of dei&s;m, at the opening of this fir&s;t vi&s;ion, which I give in his own words.</P>

<P>IT was evening: the moon &s;hone bright. The &s;tars glittered in the heavens, &s;o di&s;tinctly that I could call them by name. I admired the wonders of God in the firmament, and adored the Author of exi&s;tence. This recalled to my mind the hi&s;to|ry of creation, and the records of that book, which I had for &s;ome time neglected. For the moment,
<PB N="8" REF="023207_0007_0FBE7FC8AE7D42A8">remor&s;e took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. I retired to my &s;tudy and took my Bible; but, on opening it, much of its grandeur was lo&s;t, and no part &s;eemed to invite my attention. I laid it down, and took up a book, entitled "THE RELIGION OF NATURE," in which the author attempts to prove him&s;elf more capable than his Maker, of propo&s;ing a &s;y&s;tem of faith and morals. However ab&s;urd his attempt, the title then promi&s;ed ju&s;t what &s;uited my turn of mind. I &s;oon ran over the contents, and ca&s;ting my eye upon the chapters, caught, with a tran&s;i|tory plea&s;ure, the following words: "This proves, that the writings of Mo&s;es are farcical, that the &s;tory of Ruth and E&s;ther is ridiculous; that the account of a theocracy is whim&s;ical; and as to the P&s;alms of David and the Prophecies, (as they are called) any man of tolerable genius, might write better. The Proverbs of Solomon are old &s;entences, which were current in his day; and as to the New Te&s;tament, there is &s;carcely a page, but what con|tains &s;omething incredible and impo&s;&s;ible." He went on to ridicule the doctrine of miracles, and to &s;hew, that no man of &s;en&s;e would believe any thing, unle&s;s he knew the rea&s;on of it. I did not examine how he attempted to prove all this, nor what &s;y&s;tem he propo&s;ed in the room of it; but he &s;aid enough to balance all the impre&s;&s;ions, with which I &s;at down, and I retired to re&s;t in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>My &s;leep was confu&s;ed, and towards morning, methought I was tran&s;ported to the bed&s;ide of my father who appeared to be in his la&s;t moments. It was a &s;cene, which touched me to the heart. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ed did I feel, at &s;eeing my parent, the guide of my youth, &s;o near the grave. To me the world had begun to propo&s;e its allurements; all
<PB N="9" REF="023207_0008_0FBE7FC9C0341020">the objects of time and &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to be gilded. I had not then conceived a thought, that the colouring was all imparted from my own eye, nor had &s;u&s;pected that when the&s;e eyes &s;hould, like my father's, lo&s;e their lu&s;tre, the world would lo&s;e its charms.</P>
<P>How fondly, and o&s;t how fatally, are youth de|ceived! They pur&s;ue the &s;hadow of a moment, and lo&s;e the eternal &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It &s;eems at this moment a reality, that my fath|er, feeble and almo&s;t breathle&s;s, took my hand, and &s;aid, <HI>"Weep not, my &s;on, I go to a better world. Tru&s;ting in my Saviour, 'to die will be everla&s;ting gain.' I expect you to preach the go&s;pel, and in a few years to &s;ee you following me, bringing with you the &s;eals of your mini&s;try and the crown of your rejoicing. The time will come, when like me, you mu&s;t be &s;urrounded by weeping friends, breathing your la&s;t. Keep that hour ever in mind, and you will be faithful to the &s;ouls of men. Avoid &s;ubtle rea&s;onings. Preach in its power and extent the doctrines of the cro&s;s, and ever be found bearing about you the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel of peace. Imitate your divine Saviour, go about doing good, vi&s;it the &s;ick, comfort mourners, pour balm into wounds, and point out the Lamb of God, to all who are enquiring the way to Zion; and, my &s;on, con&s;ider that I &s;hall expect &s;oon to embrace you in a world, where we &s;hall never part."</HI></P>
<P>My father knew the tenderne&s;s of my heart, and forebore &s;aying many things, which he might have added, and &s;oon after appeared calmly to breathe his la&s;t, &s;aying, 'INTO THY HANDS, MY SAVIOUR, I COMMIT MY SPIRIT!' Such was the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment, that I would have gladly followed, and left the world to its vanities, and my de&s;truc|tive books to be cankered by their poi&s;ons. At
<PB N="10" REF="023207_0009_0FBE7FCB409B7CB0">waking, the impre&s;&s;ion was fre&s;h in my mind, and my pillow was moi&s;tened with tears. Though I found it but a dream of the night, it &s;eemed like a warning from heaven. The &s;olemn &s;ound of my father's voice &s;till rung in my ears, as if an angel &s;poke. I ro&s;e and opened my Bible, and with what rapture did I turn over the leaves of that in&s;pired volume. Then with what contempt did I regard the feeble rea&s;onings of man, when oppo&s;ed to the wi&s;dom of God. How could men leave &s;uch foun|tains of love for &s;treams of pride! How could they prefer the trifles of a moment, the rattles of an hour, to everla&s;ting riches! Is it po&s;&s;ible that I was ever blind to the&s;e &s;acred truths? And can I now think of clo&s;ing the&s;e records of redeeming love? No. this &s;hall be the man of my coun&s;els. Of this go&s;pel I will be the herald. By this &s;hall I be enabled to become an humble in&s;trument of the Spirit, to lead enquiring &s;ouls into the way of all truth; to admini&s;ter the ble&s;&s;ed comforts of our mo&s;t holy religion to the mourners in Zion, and to lead the thir&s;ty &s;oul to the wells of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>How will the &s;pirit of my father be rejoiced to &s;ee me arrive at the heavenly courts, attended by tho&s;e who, through my mini&s;try, &s;hall be re&s;cued from &s;in and death, and brought into the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>As well might Athei&s;ts talk of heaven, as Dei&s;ts hope for future happine&s;s. Can their &s;y&s;tems &s;tand the conflagration? Can their wood, hay and &s;tubble, built upon the &s;and, endure that fire which &s;hall try every work? No! Then will I begin in earne&s;t to build gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones upon the foundation of the go&s;pel. On this book

<P>NOTHING could be more plea&s;ing, at this time, than to &s;ee Clio firm to his re&s;olution; but his conviction of the truth re&s;ulted from feelings ex|cited by a vi&s;ion. I vi&s;ited him, while under all the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which he has de&s;cribed. He &s;hed abundance of tears at his former folly, and a&s;&s;ur|ed me, that he was now re&s;olved to be a chri&s;tian indeed. Knowing the quickne&s;s of his feelings, and convinced, that he relied upon his own &s;trength, I propo&s;ed to him the&s;e words, which he has &s;ince told me, that he had afterwards occa&s;ion to con|&s;ider as peculiarly prophetic. <HI>"The youths &s;hall faint and be weary, and the young men &s;hall utterly fall."</HI> Had he then waited upon the Lord, his &s;trength would have been renewed, and he might have mounted, on the wings of the go&s;pel, as an eagle; but he fell, and great indeed was his fall. It is ea&s;y to de&s;cend, but hard to retrack our &s;teps. Youth are ea&s;ily charmed into the paths of vice. To them virtue &s;eems a rugged way. A&s;k the aged Chri&s;tian, and he will tell you, from experi|ence, that THE WAYS OF VIRTUE ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS. A&s;k the aged &s;inner, and he will tell you, <HI>"I was allured into the paths of vice. In the &s;pring of life I &s;et out on flowers, and for a lit|tle
<PB N="12" REF="023207_0011_0FBE7FCEE9C4FA58">time the path was delightful. I pur&s;ued it with the ardor of youth, farther than I can ever retrack, for lo! the winter of age is come, and the flowers are no more."</HI> Let youth be warned, that beneath the ro&s;es of plea&s;ure are the briars of pain.</P>
<P>Clio had received much excellent advice, had heard the le&s;&s;ons of experience; his impre&s;&s;ions were &s;trong; but his heart was unguarded. His former a&s;&s;ociates &s;oon found admi&s;&s;ion to his room. Wi&s;hing to per&s;uade them, he communicated the &s;u&s;pen&s;e of his mind, his vi&s;ion, and con&s;equent re&s;olution.</P>
<P>They were too artful to ridicule him at once; but began to hint at the prejudice of education, on which they at length &s;o much refined, as to in|&s;i&s;t, that nothing ought to be believed, which we learnt of our parents; that all the experience to which the aged pretend, was only to make youth revere them, and imbibe their principles, without examination; that when people began to be old and gloomy, they &s;aw every thing through a wrong medium. One proceeded &s;o far as to &s;ay, that he de&s;pi&s;ed all old mu&s;ty le&s;&s;ons of his father; that he would think for him&s;elf, and that he did not want a &s;tronger argument again&s;t any propo&s;ition, than that it was maintained by our forefathers.</P>
<P>Clio propo&s;ed the following an&s;wer: "Do we not grow wi&s;er as we grow older? and why &s;hould not our parents be &s;uppo&s;ed to do the &s;ame. They have pa&s;&s;ed through this very time of life, and the &s;un &s;hone then as bright as now. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e many nights have interfered be|tween their youth and ours, that their days were darker, or their minds le&s;s improved than ours. They have experience, and my father has often told me, that THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AGED, WAS
<PB N="13" REF="023207_0012_0FBE7FD06AFE5518">BETTER THAN SILVER AND GOLD TO THE YOUNG. Can they have any motive to adopt wrong princi|ples, or to in&s;truct their children in what they do not believe?"</P>
<P>His &s;educers had been accu&s;tomed to &s;uch re|marks, and an&s;wered them partly with appearance of argument, and partly with &s;neers and ridicule: "Solomon," they &s;aid, "was for pronouncing vanity upon this world, when he was too old to en|joy it." And they added&mdash;"No &s;ubject or object can make a ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, except at the very mo|ment of ob&s;erving it. Our parents may as well judge of the proportions of a building, at a thou|&s;and miles di&s;tance, as of our plea&s;ures, or princi|ples, or religion, at their di&s;tance of age."</P>
<P>Clio gave &s;ome heed to this remark, not reflect|ing on the infinite difference between mere &s;ubjects and objects of &s;en&s;e, and tho&s;e moral principles and practices, the ju&s;t conception of which, ever depend upon mature judgment and experience. SOPHISTRY HAS RUINED ITS THOUSANDS! 'Tis the engine, which the enemy of man mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully employs again&s;t the minds of youth.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;ophi&s;ts under&s;tood Clio's unguarded part, and there plied with &s;ucce&s;s. "How," &s;aid they, "can a young man, of genius and talents, be dependent for his religion on his nur&s;e, and quote for argument, the prattle of a fire-&s;ide? Do not all &s;ubjects &s;tand on their own ba&s;is? If a religion be unrea&s;onable, it ought to be rejected; and if there be rea&s;ons enough, by them let it be &s;up|ported; for MERE HEREDITARY RELIGION IS GOOD FOR NOTHING." This la&s;t remark being <HI>perfectly true,</HI> gave an air of truth to the preceding ones.</P>
<P>Clio's pride, as a &s;cholar, was now called into exerci&s;e, and he con&s;idered him&s;elf to have renounced
<PB N="14" REF="023207_0013_0FBE7FD305596280">nothing, when he con&s;ented to try the truth of the book by argument. He re&s;olved to defend it again&s;t their attacks, and vainly hoped that the&s;e would be among his fir&s;t converts.</P>
<P>Alas! little did he know his own &s;trength; for as yet he had never proved the armour of the go&s;|pel, nor known the power of the Spirit of God. But this intere&s;ting &s;cene we have in his own words, which introduce the &s;econd vi&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CLIO'S</HI> Father becomes his Guardian Angel.</HEAD>
<P>FOR ever gloomy will appear to me that night, when, with my &s;educing a&s;&s;ociates, I opened the &s;acred volume, and vainly pre&s;umed to e&s;tabli&s;h the eternal truth of God, upon the feeble rea&s;on of man. We had not even attained maturity of mind; mere youths, ju&s;t &s;tarted into being, and indebted for all our little knowledge to our par|ents and in&s;tructors! yet we pre&s;umptuou&s;ly ar|raigned the&s;e our be&s;t friends, before the very tri|bunal of knowledge, which they had erected in our minds, and there ungratefully condemned them as old, as prejudiced, and unworthy to guide us. ALAS! HOW MANY YOUTHS HAVE BEEN RUINED BY AN AFFECTED INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT! HOW INDEPENDENT ARE SUCH OF REASON, OF GRATITUDE, OF SENSE AND REFLECTION!&mdash;But the word of God was opened, and mere children, who ought to have been under a father's rod, were &s;itting with mock maje&s;ty, to decide upon the truth of revelation. When David was champion of the
<PB N="15" REF="023207_0014_0FBE7FD61510BEF8">armies of I&s;rael, he relied not o^l^l his &s;tone and &s;ling, but in the name of the Lord, and in the &s;trength of the mighty God of Jacob. But I, alas! had not even a &s;tone nor a &s;ling; yet might have made &s;ome defence again&s;t my a&s;&s;ociates, feeble as my&s;elf, had not they produced again&s;t me the mighty Go|liahs, the champions of infidelity, who have long defied the experienced &s;oldiers in the armies of Je&s;us. To their helmets of bra&s;s and mighty &s;pears, what could I oppo&s;e? The conte&s;t was &s;hort; I re&s;igned the Bible, renounced the doctrines of the cro&s;s, which I was to have preached, and became more fatally than before, a victim to &s;ubtlety and &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>The event was &s;uch as an experienced parent could have foretold. We triumphed together up|on a reunion of &s;entiment, and I retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Not long had my eyes been clo&s;ed, when the well-known face of my father pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me. The natural benignity of his countenance was heightened by cele&s;tial &s;miles. He was apparelled in white, which I have &s;ince learned, were the robes of the Redeemer's righteou&s;ne&s;s. He had in his right hand a branch of palm-tree, which he told me, was an emblem of victory; not gained by him&s;elf, but pre&s;ented by the mighty Conqueror. Says he, <HI>"I am permitted to leave yonder world, to vi&s;it the &s;on of my hopes: You are de&s;igned by the great Head of the Church, to be a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and to be in&s;trumental in turning many from the error of their ways, to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t. By nature you were formed, both in heart and &s;oul, for the arduous ta&s;k.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You are to be an officer in the armies of Je&s;us, and to oppo&s;e the weapons, which his go&s;pel has furni&s;hed, again&s;t the rebels to his cau&s;e and kingdom. You are
<PB N="16" REF="023207_0015_0FBE7FDA3B047D70">to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring to allegiance, tho&s;e, who have once declared, that they will not have Chri&s;t to reign over them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"I appear to you, that you may never be led to doubt the truth of God. Behold, I have been tran&s;lat|ed to immortal life, and you &s;hall live for ever: But I have left you in a world full of error and temptation, and am fearful that you will, in &s;ome unguarded mo|ment, be allured from the new and living way, which is opened through the veil, into the holy of holies."</HI></P>

<P>With what &s;weet &s;erenity, and irre&s;i&s;tible elo|quence, did he teach me the character of a Chri&s;|tian preacher, and open to me the doctrines of the New Te&s;tament?

<HEAD>CLIO deluded by the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>SHAFTESBURY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>&mdash;HOW mu&s;t the &s;pirit of my guar|dian parent have been affected, at &s;eeing a &s;trip|ling go forth, thus mi&s;erably prepared for the work of the mini&s;try! Had I then per&s;i&s;ted, he would &s;urely have re&s;trained me.</P>
<P>How was it po&s;&s;ible that I, all ignorant of men, and de&s;titute of grace and go&s;pel truth, as the bea&s;ts which peri&s;h, &s;hould pre&s;ume to offer my|&s;elf to in&s;truct men in the way to heaven? How could I, who was dead, and under the &s;entence of the law condemned, teach men to live and be &s;av|ed? Were my hands pure enough to handle the word of life? Alas! I had not then ta&s;ted that the Lord was gracious: But I was prevented from this great evil, by a very &s;ingular incident. One of me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">iends had &s;ugge&s;ted to me the importance of &s;ome knowledge of men, before I attempted to preach to them, and advi&s;ed me, <HI>very ignorantly,</HI> to go through a cour&s;e of &s;tudies upon human nature, and &s;ubjects of real life. I did not then reflect, that books were but the pictures of life; that &s;ome were very deficient in real likene&s;s; that the fa&s;hion of the world changed; and that if the di&s;orders of the heart remained always the &s;ame, yet the &s;ymptoms were perpetually varying. Books I &s;tudi|ed for a knowledge of men, and was peculiarly plea&s;ed with the ingenious philo&s;ophy of Shafte&s;|bury.</P>
<P>He taught, in mo&s;t charming language, the dignity of human nature; and on the rubbi&s;h of &s;in, folly and fa&s;hion erected a &s;uperb &s;tructure of
<PB N="22" REF="023207_0021_0FBE7FEC2388FC20">morality. This was decorated with all the elegan|cies of his fancy, and pre&s;ented to the eye, as hav|ing the &s;tricte&s;t proportions.</P>
<P>MY YOUNG FRIENDS ENTER NOT THE PORCH OF HIS DOORS, FOR WITHIN ARE THE CHAMBERS OF DEATH.</P>
<P>Soon will that fabric feel its want of founda|tion and totter to the ground, cru&s;hing all who &s;hall be found in it.</P>
<P>On clo&s;ing this book, I thought my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a key to all hearts; was per&s;uaded, that MAN, created in the likene&s;s of God; that MAN, the lord of this lower world; that MAN, &s;o near to angels, was full of dignity; that he needed no threats and terrors, but that mildne&s;s and per&s;ua|&s;ion, addre&s;&s;ed to his rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, would be &s;ure of producing effect.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the days when I talked learnedly about <HI>the moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;oft pliability of the human &s;oul;</HI> about the natural attraction between the mind of man, and every thing good, amiable and excellent throughout the univer&s;e. I &s;ought the company of tho&s;e, who admired the ingenious &s;y&s;tem, and wondered at the &s;tupidity of the world, in not &s;eeing its ju&s;tice. This led me to ridicule the doctrine of moral depravity.</P>
<P>I even refined upon the &s;y&s;tem, and pur&s;ued it, ju&s;t as the author could have wi&s;hed, fir&s;t oppo&s;|ing all exerci&s;e of puni&s;hment on earth, for breach of human laws. THE LORDS OF CREATION WERE TO BE LED, NOT DRIVEN. But I could not fail to re|flect on the millions of men, who are exceedingly vicious and deba&s;ed, abandoned to the meane&s;t vices, to the profounde&s;t ignorance, or the mo&s;t horrid crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="023207_0022_0FBE7FEDA68AD240">
Men once &s;y&s;tem-mad are not ea&s;ily checked. My new doctrine would prove or di&s;prove any thing. I made it change the whole face of the natural and moral world. The earth was culti|vated, and all the bloom of Eden &s;miling in the mid&s;t of winter. Men of all cla&s;&s;es became moral and indu&s;trious. Hills lay low, and vallies ro&s;e at my command; and here I &s;aw clearly, that this principle was finally to prepare the way for a mil|lennial &s;tate. The influence of it began to be vi&s;|ible in the abolition of &s;lavery, in the increa&s;e of in&s;titutions of learning, and in the revolutions of empire.</P>
<P>With &s;hame I reflect on tho&s;e vagaries of a di&s;|tempered brain, tho&s;e whims of an ungoverned fancy; yet this &s;y&s;tem of dignity was then in all my di&s;cour&s;e; it regulated my choice of diet; was applicable to all profe&s;&s;ions, to every body, and to every bu&s;ine&s;s under the &s;un.</P>
<P>With confidence I intruded it into every body's affairs, and left my own eternal bu&s;ine&s;s undone. While I thought the doctrine my &s;lave, which would go and come at my command; it was in fact my God. I wor&s;hipped it, and paid to it the homage of all my faculties.</P>
<P>To crown all, Shafte&s;bury's &s;y&s;tem (if only his name was omitted) proved the truth of revelation and elucidated all its doctrines. Once after a re|tired walk, having wrought my&s;elf into a frenzy of dignity and moral &s;en&s;e, I bur&s;t forth into the following exclamation, <HI>"Franklin may boa&s;t of &s;natching lightning from the clouds, it &s;hall be mine to &s;hine in the moral world with more di&s;tingui&s;hed fame. I'll teach men, that though the thunders of the mount, and the wrath of God mu&s;t fall, I can render them
<PB N="24" REF="023207_0023_0FBE7FEF2AAB2820">perfectly harmle&s;s. This &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be the conductor, and thus all the families of the earth &s;hall be &s;afe."</HI></P>
<P>I had wrought up the figure to its highe&s;t pitch; but was more &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve a parallel be|tween Franklin's glory and mine, than between the thunder of our clouds, and THE THUNDER OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD.</P>
<P>On returning, I opened my Bible, and between the original and tran&s;lation, new modelled the hi&s;|tory of the fall, proving that it was an actual <HI>ri&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>By the fir&s;t chapter of I&s;aiah I found, that (oth|erwi&s;e tran&s;lated) man was from the crown of his head to the &s;oals of his feet <HI>all</HI> &s;oundne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the New Te&s;tament much was wrong; but when I found, that in &s;o many pa&s;&s;ages, we were a&s;&s;ured, that the wrath of God &s;hould be revealed upon all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of man, I concluded not to alter them, but to do better for God and men, &s;aving the honor of the fir&s;t, and the &s;ouls of the la&s;t. I contrived that when the wrath mu&s;t come, it &s;hould light upon the <HI>&s;ins;</HI> but leave the &s;inner unhurt; and that in the la&s;t great day, when &s;in|ners were &s;ummoned to appear before the bar of God, the <HI>&s;ins</HI> &s;hould appear, and an&s;wer for the deeds, which they had done in the <HI>pure</HI> bodies of men; but&mdash;how could &s;ins appear alone, and where would the man be, in whom tho&s;e &s;ins were committed? All this was ea&s;ily contrived, at that inventive time of life. The &s;oul was to be &s;eparat|ed from the pa&s;&s;ions; the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were to ac|company the &s;ins; and the man, who had been an actual &s;ufferer by the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and their &s;ins, would &s;ee the righteous &s;entence of God executed upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="023207_0024_0FBE7FF3B3E1D470">
All the&s;e things were proved and illu&s;trated by many texts of &s;cripture. Every thing bent kindly to my purpo&s;e, and I little &s;u&s;pected, that by pu&s;h|ing the theory a little further, it would, by a like proce&s;s, prove that there was no need of a God, a Saviour, or a Bible.</P>
<P>At that time my mind was not &s;trong enough to advance thus far, though &s;ince I have done it. Upon this part of my hi&s;tory, I am led to remark the danger of indulging in theories upon religion, without recour&s;e to the Bible. I was at that time actually a dei&s;t, though I did not &s;u&s;pect it; for I had impiou&s;ly made the word of God conform to my &s;y&s;tem, in&s;tead of conforming my&s;elf to the in&s;allible &s;tandard of truth.</P>
<P>My Bible was open more than ever; but it was no longer GOD'S BIBLE. I admired revelation in|deed; but it was only tho&s;e parts of it, which were an exact tran&s;cript of <HI>my</HI> mind and will, not of God's; and when any doubts aro&s;e, I hu&s;hed them by the words INTERNAL EVIDENCE, MORAL SENSE. The&s;e were univer&s;al opiates.</P>
<P>My &s;leeping vi&s;ions were full of truth, but this waking vi&s;ion I &s;hall ever have rea&s;on to con&s;ider, as a contrivance of Satan, to effect the ruin of my &s;oul. Shall I add, that &s;o &s;trong was my delu&s;ion, that with a new go&s;pel, thus made by my&s;elf, I had the confidence to propo&s;e to be recognized, in the u&s;u|al form of the country, as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>One day, &s;itting and conver&s;ing with him, I took occa&s;ion to recal the vi&s;ions which he had re|lated to me, and the manife&s;t means of Providence in bringing him to a knowledge of the truth. He
<PB N="30" REF="023207_0029_0FBE7FFCA4EE6C08">&s;eemed much agitated for the moment, then took up his Bible, cla&s;ped it, and threw it upon his ta|ble with &s;ome vehemence, then bur&s;t into tears. &s;aying, "My friend, I wi&s;h never again to con|ver&s;e with you on this &s;ubject. I am now re&s;olved, and neither arguments nor vi&s;ions &s;hall move me. THAT BOOK I GIVE TO FOOLS AND FANATICKS."</P>
<P>After this, he became a man of the world, was totally carele&s;s of religion; yet he profe&s;&s;ed to be|lieve in the being of a God, and in the immortal|ity of the &s;oul. Virgil's account of a future &s;tate, he would often &s;ay, was far more rational, than the Bible account; and that if he was hone&s;t and tolerably moral, he &s;hould get &s;afe enough to Ely&s;ium.</P>
<P>He found, in a conver&s;e with the world, that his favorite &s;y&s;tem often betrayed him; but could not yet per&s;uade him&s;elf to renounce it.&mdash;He was ready to di&s;pute with Chri&s;tians, Dei&s;ts, or Scep|tics, and could per&s;onate either of tho&s;e characters. He had &s;tudied accurately the philo&s;ophy of the &s;chools of Athens, and by an happy talent, had &s;o moderni&s;ed it, that all the wi&s;dom of enlightened Greece appeared his own.</P>
<P>He under&s;tood the &s;y&s;tem of Berkley, and could reduce to decimal fractions, infinitely, the lea&s;t ap|pearance of matter; could even &s;ubdivide atoms &s;o &s;mall, that they were invi&s;ible to the human eye, and inconceivable by the human mind; or at plea&s;ure he could prove that the whole earth was one conjoint, indivi&s;ible, immen&s;e atom. He could place the earth on a tortoi&s;e, or &s;u&s;pend it in the air; could make it whirl millions of miles in a &s;econd, or be totally at re&s;t. He had di&s;covered the weak &s;ide of human nature, and was &s;ure of
<PB N="31" REF="023207_0030_0FBE7FFE276D8180">being <HI>thought learned, when he conver&s;ed, &s;o that no one under&s;tood him.</HI></P>
<P>His pride of &s;cience was now in its zenith, and by all the ignorant, he was e&s;teemed a prodigy. He did not care to conver&s;e with the learned, who practi&s;ed, as he did, the magic power. No credit was to be gained from tho&s;e who were in the &s;e|cret. He well knew the jealou&s;y, and enmity, which generally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between your great met|aphy&s;ical and unfathomable &s;cholars.</P>
<P>He di&s;covered that the loude&s;t talker, and the bolde&s;t a&s;&s;erter was generally mo&s;t applauded; and that the laurels of genius were never to be expect|ed from learned competitors. He reduced the&s;e ob&s;ervations to a general principle, which he ap|plied to all arts and profe&s;&s;ions, forming a complete "SYSTEM OF HUMAN NATURE," which I have in manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>I have no occa&s;ion to notice his travels, his books, or his company, only &s;o far, that the reader may trace his <HI>pride of &s;cience, and the natural con|&s;equences of infidelity;</HI> nor mu&s;t we forget, that even now were perceivable, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the effects of a GOOD EARLY EDUCATION. This had an un&s;een influence, and was finally improved, by the Spirit of God, for his recovery.</P>
<P>His guardian parent &s;eemed to have for&s;aken him; his vi&s;ions were no more; all his partial convictions and re&s;olutions forgotten, and he was left to him&s;elf. "This earth," he &s;aid, "was his pre&s;ent re&s;idence, and this life, the only one which he was ab&s;olutely &s;ure of: that he was re&s;olved to <HI>live,</HI> while he did live, and if after he died, another life &s;hould be given him, he would make the mo&s;t of it."</P>

Such conver&s;ation often pur&s;ued by his friends, at length led him to doubt the immortality of the &s;oul. This alarmed him.

<P>His manu&s;cript treati&s;e upon this is long and full of laboured &s;ophi&s;try. He had exerted all the powers of his &s;oul to prove, that he had no &s;oul; but a doubt occurring, how this principle of life could be annihilated, he fell into the doctrine of <HI>tran&s;migration.</HI> This was long a favorite &s;cheme.

He pur&s;ued the &s;y&s;tem in this whim&s;ical manner, and for him&s;elf re&s;olved to be an eagle.</P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed with this change of being, and delighted with this creature of his fancy; he even &s;pent whole nights in drawing conclu&s;ions in fav|or of it, from various experiments in anatomy.</P>

But &s;teep is the de&s;cent to the &s;hades of error. Clio was not to re&s;t here. He caught by accident a book in an old library, entitled, "MAN A MA|CHINE," written by La Metrie. This was the very &s;ubject which lay next to tran&s;migration. He took it up, merely to gratify curio&s;ity; but the old philo&s;opher under&s;tood very well the machinery of man; too well for Clio. From the fir&s;t page, he was led to the &s;econd, and &s;o on through the book. He made no pau&s;e, and no conclu&s;ions; but half convinced, gave it a &s;econd reading, again a third. THE PRIDE OF SCIENCE was touched; he longed to be ma&s;ter of the &s;y&s;tem; though he was &s;till unre&s;olved to admit it.</P>
<P>But we often rea&s;on our&s;elves into blindne&s;s. He rea&s;oned upon the &s;tructure of the human bo|dy, of which he had obtained a mo&s;t accurate knowledge; upon the nece&s;&s;ary &s;eat of the living principle; &s;hewed how the nerves conducted mu|&s;ic to the &s;oul, and how all objects of &s;en&s;e con|veyed their impre&s;&s;ions. He then rea&s;oned upon the compartments of the brain, and their appro|priate u&s;es; of the effect, which a di&s;ordered &s;tate of body has upon the &s;oul; of the operations of diet; of the circulation of the blood, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e he would throw out to his adver&s;aries, as mere trials of their &s;kill; then when their argu|ments were exhau&s;ted, he would come out with his main body.</P>
<P>This was fortified on every &s;ide, by the argu|ments again&s;t innate ideas. He would &s;ay, if we come into the world without one idea, and if this pretended &s;oul never receives any, except through the &s;en&s;es, have we any argument that the &s;oul is capable of receiving ideas without &s;uch a medium? Again, if reflection be de&s;troyed, when a man is

What is it &s;eparately? It is nothing and vanity: it has not half the properties of fixed air. His antagoni&s;ts being un|able to define their terms again&s;t him, were foiled as he was at fir&s;t, for want of premi&s;es.</P>
<P>He would pur&s;ue the triumph by remarking how far the oppo&s;ite doctrine mu&s;t carry: that it mu&s;t prove the perpetual exi&s;tence of the living princi|ple, both in brute animals and vegetables; and he would add with empha&s;is, if we renounce La Me|trie's principle, <HI>even the &s;tones of the &s;treet would be immortal, and we might expect to &s;ee rocks in a cour&s;e of ages, ri&s;ing into rational life, and haranguing an audience of rivers and fore&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>When he was rallied upon the&s;e flights, he would coolly lead his antagoni&s;ts into the old doc|trine of the &s;chools, OF AN UNIVERSAL ATTRACT|ING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE, IN THE CENTRE OF THE MORAL WORLD; would a&s;&s;ert that all living nature was drawn by it from lower to higher grades, thro' eternity; here he would lead them from the lowe&s;t vegetable up to the highe&s;t exi&s;tence; and as they could &s;eldom follow him, through all the mazes of natural hi&s;tory, they were &s;oon lo&s;t and confound|ed, and the triumph was completely his own.</P>
<P>Clio longed to make <HI>this</HI> la&s;t theory his own; but it would lead him too far back, and his bent was forward; he was for ANNIHILATION. Long had he left his favorite &s;y&s;tem of <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> and was too proud to look back.</P>
<P>The ground was now his own, and he could walk through regions of fancy, before untrod by man.</P>

<P>I have recorded the&s;e things of Clio &s;o minutely, as this was a mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of his life; and as it opens a &s;cene, perhaps unparalleled on our records, of the intricate wi&s;dom of God.</P>

<P>&mdash;SHOULD my hi&s;tory ever reach the light, may it be a le&s;&s;on to the youths who &s;hall follow me!</P>
<P>In early life, I was a victim to the pride of &s;ci|ence. The knowledge, which I derived from my parents, was exerted to prove, that no re&s;pect was to be paid to their parental in&s;truction. My know|ledge, derived from the Bible, was exerted to prove that Bible fal&s;e. Then all the&s;e acquirements were employed as rebels to my God, my Saviour, and my Bible, in &s;upporting the cau&s;e of their bitter|e&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>I even endeavored to gain the influence of the officers of heaven, that I might be a &s;ecure &s;py in the camp of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>At length I impiou&s;ly renounced my Bible to fools and fanatics. I even improved the immor|tal faculties of my &s;oul, to prove that my &s;oul was formed of du&s;t and a&s;hes, and gloried in the pro&s;|pect of eternal &s;leep. I made &s;tocks and &s;tones my brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and improved the breath which God had breathed into my no&s;trils, to con|vince the world, that my breath was my own. Wor&s;e than all, I improved not only the light of my mind, but even the &s;even golden candle&s;ticks, to light me into the glooms of heatheni&s;h igno|rance and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>THIS WAS AT A TIME, WHEN I LOVED DARK|NESS RATHER THAN LIGHT. WHEN MY EYES COULD NOT ENDURE THE CELESTIAL GLORY OF THE BRIGHT AND THE MORNING STAR.</P>
<P><PB REF="023207_0036_0FBE8014D7FF2870">
Why &s;hould I then retain God in my know|ledge, when I had denied his wi&s;dom, his word, his providence and his works? Without the&s;e there is no God. I did not do it. I was a <HI>con&s;i&s;tent in|fidel,</HI> and pur&s;ued my principles to the very gates of hell. On my principles there was no need of a God; for I then could as well have conceived of matter &s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-created and eternal, as of a being with all the&s;e attributes, capable of creating it, with all its forms and modifications. I will not proceed; it is enough that I denied the God who made me, that I erected athei&s;m upon the foundation of infidelity. I boa&s;t not that I under&s;tood the economy of Satan's kingdom, and that I was his ma&s;ter-builder; perhaps the only one, who ever made u&s;e of all his materials, in erecting to the pinnacle, a temple of his wor&s;hip.

<P>CLIO has &s;o frequently interwoven the early and latter &s;cenes of his life, that I am often oblig|ed to interrupt his own narration, to pre&s;erve a clear connexion in the mind of the reader.</P>
<P>We are now to contemplate Clio in the depth of infidelity. He could get no farther from moral light. But this was to be his tropic, from which
<PB N="38" REF="023207_0037_0FBE801638D96FB0">we &s;hall &s;ee him gradually advancing back. With what heart-rending eloquence has Clio often de&s;|cribed to me the &s;tate of his mind, at this gloomy period. I mu&s;t reluctantly omit to record it, and leave the reader to pur&s;ue the thought.</P>
<P>Clio, by a fortunate accident, took up the writ|ings of old Python, ma&s;ter of the &s;ceptical &s;chool in Athens; this he read with plea&s;ure, and became per&s;uaded to doubt of every thing. He had never reflected, that upon moral &s;ubjects, the world have agreed to adopt certain fir&s;t principles, which no man can di&s;pute more fairly, than he can the let|ters of the alphabet. Old Python had propo&s;ed a great number of the plaine&s;t fir&s;t principles, and challenged all the other &s;chools, to &s;upport any one of them, by ab&s;tract rea&s;oning. Knowing, that this could never be done, he had proceeded to &s;hew, <HI>that the great truths in all the &s;ciences were only arbitrary axioms, which owed their &s;upport to the credulity of man; that truth it&s;elf was but a relative term, and that any man of tolerable acutene&s;s might confound any &s;ubject, or any rea&s;oner, by denying his fir&s;t principle, and obliging him to attempt the proof of it.</HI></P>
<P>Here Python proceeded to record his victories over the logicians of his day. Clio was convinced, not reflecting that a true di&s;ciple of Python mu&s;t <HI>doubt</HI> the truth of what he wrote. He became a Sceptic, which is one grade <HI>better</HI> than an Athei&s;t, for IT IS BETTEK TO DOUBT, WHETHER THERE BE A GOD, THAN TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO GOD. Clio had &s;ome &s;ecret wi&s;h to live beyond this &s;tate of being, and endeavored to refine &s;o far upon &s;ceptici&s;m, that when he actually died, he might always be in doubt, whether he was or was not dead.</P>
<P><PB REF="023207_0038_0FBE8017CF151968">
He was &s;truck with the ab&s;urdity of this, and turning about to pur&s;ue the principle, among the different doctrines of religion, and &s;y&s;tems of phi|lo&s;ophy in the world, he re&s;olved to &s;ap their foun|dations, and to make them totter. He ought to have <HI>doubted</HI> his &s;trength; but here we &s;hall &s;ee the Spirit of God, beginning to operate upon him. We &s;hall &s;ee it improving, for his recovery, tho&s;e very faculties, which Satan had before employed for his ruin. Even this pride of &s;cience was im|proved as a leading in&s;trument. Here let us pau&s;e a moment, that we may notice, with all due atten|tion, the wi&s;dom of God; for we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, in Clio's conver&s;ion, how <HI>he improves not only good early education, but even pride and other perver&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es.</HI> "Even the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e God."</P>

I wi&s;hed, that on the &s;tone which &s;hould cover my remains, might be in&s;cribed, <HI>"Here lies a man, who &s;acrificed his life to the infant intere&s;ts of his country, and found an early grave; but he was full of days, if we count them by his &s;orrows, his pains, his mi&s;eries, and the vici&s;&s;itudes of his life. Here he lies low in death; let the tears of a grateful public moi&s;ten his grave."</HI></P>
<P>I then thought, as I now do, that "HE DE|SERVES NO STONE TO RECORD HIS NAME, WHO LEAVES NO ACTION TO ENDEAR HIS MEMORY."&mdash;With a heart warm as the world is cold, and having ever in view the end of life, I pur&s;ued the thought, and con|templated the &s;erious time, when followed by tho&s;e who were mine in the &s;tricte&s;t bonds of nature, duty and affection, I &s;hould be carried to the hou&s;e appointed for all living. Then a long train of parents would follow, leading the children of my care, all in &s;olemn &s;ilence, paying a tribute to my memory, more durable and precious than mon|uments of marble.</P>
<P>The&s;e I have found vain illu&s;ions, mere waking "vi&s;ions of a ba&s;ele&s;s fabric;" yet for the time, they gave joy to my heart, &s;trengthened my hands, and led me to exertions beyond the powers of na|ture. In my days, I had not lei&s;ure for the com|mon recreations of li&s;e; my nights were &s;leeple&s;sly &s;pent in preparations for the morning; yet my
<PB N="44" REF="023207_0043_0FBE80246D9C6C10">mind was active, my imagination bright, and my &s;oul feelingly alive to all my duties.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is, I imprudently denied to nature, the repo&s;e which &s;he required, my health failed, and I became a &s;ubject of pain and gloom. All the fe&s;tivities of life were courted. I re&s;orted to brilliancy and gaiety, and indulged in &s;cenes of humor for relief. All was in vain. If I &s;miled! it was like the lightning of the heavens, which leaves the eye in more "intimate darkne&s;s." It was a tran&s;ient gleam of brightne&s;s on the face, which brings no warmth to the heart. How oft, that I might not give pain to a friend, have I re|tired, where no eye could &s;ee me, to commune with my own heart, and to a&s;k from it that relief which the world could not give.</P>
<P>In moments of gloom, all the painful images which through life have been &s;een, all the gho&s;ts of departed actions, appear at once, &s;hewing their hideous &s;pectres to the eye of the &s;oul. All the malicious demons, who had aimed cruel &s;tabs at the reputation, now pre&s;ent anew their poinards, and "grin horribly a gha&s;tly &s;mile," in&s;ulting the wretch's woe.</P>
<P>The whole &s;cene is beyond de&s;cription; even the half cannot be told you; yet the whole was mine. They only know the pangs of death, who have felt its &s;ting.</P>
<P>At &s;cenes like the&s;e, we a&s;k no tears from mar|ble eyes&mdash;no blood to flow with quick emotion in marble veins&mdash;no heart of &s;tone to beat&mdash;no iron brea&s;t to heave with &s;ighs, nor tongue of &s;teel to &s;peak; but they who <HI>can</HI> feel, <HI>will</HI> feel, and the tears of &s;en&s;ibility will flow; they will moi&s;ten the manly cheek, and &s;tream from the gli&s;tening eye, when the hand which holds this pen &s;hall be no more.</P>

<P>I RETIRED late to re&s;t, hara&s;&s;ed with care: my limbs were indeed repo&s;ed; but my mind was never more wakeful. It was winter, and the &s;ea|&s;on
<PB N="46" REF="023207_0045_0FBE80282EF4F730">peculiarly &s;evere; but I &s;eemed in&s;tantly con|veyed into a beautiful garden, where fruits and flowers were in perfection. The heat &s;eemed in|ten&s;e, and I re&s;orted to an arbour for &s;hade. My ears were &s;oon &s;aluted by a concert of the mo&s;t mu&s;ical voices, &s;eemingly of children. My curi|o&s;ity led me to follow the &s;ound, which appeared to retire as I advanced. They were &s;weet notes, and I was de&s;irous to know what cele&s;tial choirs had re&s;orted to this retirement. I walked on ha&s;t|ily through a vale enamelled with flowers: if I trod upon a ro&s;e, it drooped for the moment, but &s;oon rai&s;ed its blu&s;hing head with improved beau|ty and fragrance. I mu&s;t pau&s;e a moment to no|tice the kindne&s;s of Providence, in giving us &s;uch active fancies, capable of enjoying the beauties of nature in idea, when in truth the &s;ea&s;on had in|ve&s;ted, with fro&s;t and &s;now, the whole face of the earth. TO FANCY, TO WHIM, AND OFTEN TO FALLACY, ARE WE INDEBTED FOR HAPPINESS.</P>
<P>I reached the place, from which the &s;ound pro|ceeded, and found a large &s;chool of boys and girls, chanting a morning hymn to the prai&s;e of their Creator. There was an elegance in their appear|ance, and a &s;erene &s;mile upon their faces, &s;uch as I had never &s;een among my own children. I entered without he&s;itation. The ma&s;ter, who &s;eemed, at fir&s;t &s;ight, created to take &s;uch a charming &s;chool, beckoned me to take a &s;eat by him.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed, and all fell upon their knees, rai&s;ing their eyes, in the act of fervent devotion. The ma&s;ter then addre&s;&s;ed the throne of grace, in a few words, mo&s;t pertinent and &s;triking. All ro&s;e; there was a perfect &s;ilence; all commenced their employments, which they pur&s;ued with dili|gence. If the ma&s;ter &s;poke, every ear was atten|tive
<PB N="47" REF="023207_0046_0FBE802A69F0FBF8">and every thing proceeded with perfect ea&s;e and harmony. This, I thought, proves that my former ideas were ju&s;t; but I will enquire how this effect is produced.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed my que&s;tions, and &s;ugge&s;ted the em|barra&s;&s;ments, which I had experienced in attempt|ing to form &s;uch a &s;chool, and added, I &s;hall al|ways in future, conclude the fault to have been in my&s;elf, "Who could even frown on &s;uch inno|cents? What mon&s;ters are they who cruelly in|flict puni&s;hment on children?" I am a&s;hamed <HI>now</HI> to repeat all which I <HI>then</HI> &s;aid; but as I was clo&s;ing a laboured panegyric on my own &s;agacity, and knowledge of the effect of moral truth upon the young mind, every thing &s;eemed changed in an in&s;tant. The ma&s;ter a&s;&s;umed the appearance of an angel, and the children looked like cherubs and &s;eraphs. The angel then addre&s;&s;ed me. To &s;uch alone can your principles apply with truth. The&s;e are pure &s;pirits, and this &s;cene is all de&s;igned for your in&s;truction. He then opened to me in clear and explicit terms, the doctrine of rewards and puni&s;hments, and taught me the wi&s;dom of God in ordaining them, and their fitne&s;s to the nature of man. <HI>How many poor wretches,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>have been di&s;gracefully &s;ent out of this world, into a wor&s;e, from the mere neglect of early di&s;cipline and control. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on, when the rough and boi&s;terous pa&s;|&s;ion may be &s;ubdued, and if this &s;ea&s;on be neglected, the life will be like a garden, where the growth of every u&s;eful thing is prevented by a multitude of weeds and brambles.</HI></P>
<P>He then added, "GO AND CONDUCT LIKE A FAITHFUL GARDENER." I waked, fully impre&s;&s;ed with the vi&s;ion, and for &s;everal days revolved over the actual government of the King of the univer&s;e,
<PB N="48" REF="023207_0047_0FBE802DEA0BD310">as it is di&s;covered in his Providence, and in revela|tion. At length I e&s;tabli&s;hed a conviction, that pun|i&s;hments as well as threats were nece&s;&s;ary for man, and that it was vain to expect the rea&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t my former theory, till this rea&s;on &s;hould control the pa&s;&s;ions.

<HEAD>IMMORTALITY <HI>of the</HI> SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>HOW little do I value this emaciated body? It is welcome to return home, if my &s;oul can have the &s;ame privilege. Surely &s;ome guardian angel watches my &s;lumbers, and &s;eizes the moment, when all my pa&s;&s;ions are a&s;leep, to teach my rea&s;on the mo&s;t &s;acred truths. O that my prejudice, error and pride would never wake!</P>
<P>If this be &s;ickne&s;s, let me be &s;ick, till death, for &s;carcely do I &s;ink into the arms of &s;leep, when &s;ome un&s;een power pre&s;ents to me the &s;ublime&s;t vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The la&s;t I cannot de&s;cribe; it &s;urpa&s;&s;es my &s;trength and the powers of my pen.</P>
<P>Could I have written at the in&s;tant of the im|pre&s;&s;ion, my lines had been full of fire, they would have warmed every heart, not with poetic fire! No! for the genuine feelings of the &s;oul, at &s;uch en|trancing &s;ea&s;ons, &s;corn the aids of art, and the pri&s;|on of mea&s;ured lines. They bur&s;t forth with in|&s;piration, and delight to be arrayed in the &s;lowing robes and charming dignity of pro&s;e.</P>
<P>Can that &s;oul be mortal, which is compo&s;ed of &s;uch heaven-wrought materials? Shall that &s;oul die, which can for a &s;ea&s;on bid adieu to the &s;en&s;es and the clay, and &s;oar to &s;cenes immea&s;urably di&s;|tant? No! <HI>"The du&s;t &s;hall return to its kindred du&s;t; but the &s;pirit &s;hall return to God who gave it."</HI></P>
<P>At &s;uch moments would I have wa&s;ted a wi&s;h to be &s;ure of immortality? No! I felt my&s;elf already
<PB N="50" REF="023207_0049_0FBE8032A2EEB408">in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal being, full of princi|ples of life, which death can never de&s;troy, nor the grave dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>Such was my confidence, that had the choice been my own, I would never have been reunited to the for&s;aken ma&s;s. As &s;oon would angels leave their &s;eats of bli&s;s, their golden harps un&s;trung, their ble&s;t &s;ociety forgot, and a&s;k for human bodies to inhabit this vile earth again. But to them how little is this world! its pomps, it plea&s;ures and its non&s;en&s;e all! The crowns of monarchs, and the wealth of worlds, how trifling in their view!</P>
<P>But heaven is their ble&s;t abode, and there will they rejoice to dwell for ever. That world will never want for &s;ongs, nor God for prai&s;e. There &s;hall daily arrive, from the&s;e lower courts, after a triumphant flight from &s;en&s;e and pain, the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t. There &s;hall cherubs ever &s;mile, and &s;eraphs ever burn before the throne of God.</P>
<P>Shall flim&s;y argument, &s;hall &s;ubtle &s;ophi&s;try, and nice-wrought &s;ceptici&s;m <HI>un&s;oul</HI> the man, and reduce to a level with the lower creation, the image of God? Shall not the &s;oul of the mother meet the &s;oul of the child in the world of glory? Shall not the &s;on, who in youth was &s;unk into a watry grave, &s;ee his father again? Yes! The graves &s;hall give up their dead, and friends, who parted with aching hearts, &s;hall meet in a world, where tears &s;hall be wiped from every eye.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t return to the body! mu&s;t &s;tay yet a little longer; but in prayer will I watch each ri&s;ing &s;un, and &s;wift in duty hail it to its &s;etting.</P>
<P>Days, months and years &s;hall roll on without regret. Fain would I &s;eize the minutes of my to-morrows, and draw my&s;elf to heaven; but I
<PB N="51" REF="023207_0050_0FBE8036F7896C28">mu&s;t wait till my change come. Death will never appal me; for I know, that even in the dark val|ley of its &s;hadow, I &s;hall &s;ee beams of light from the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;ickne&s;s I will rejoice; even with pre&s;ent pains will be glad. Each pang will I regard as the beck|oning of an angel; for as the body retires, the &s;oul advances, and with one effort more I &s;hall be gone.</P>
<P>With a mo&s;t ardent exertion I &s;prang; but the body had enchained me. I was &s;till its pri&s;oner, and could not bur&s;t the bands of life. I reached not the cele&s;tial goal. I &s;prung not into heaven, but back to earth, and found my&s;elf awake, repeat|ing with prodigious energy "LET OTHERS BOAST THAT THEY ARE BRUTES, I GLORY THAT I'M A MAN. LET OTHERS WISH FOR ETERNAL SLEEP, I SHALL BE FOR EVER AWAKE. LET OTH|ERS WASTE THEIR GOLDEN HOURS IN PROVING THAT GOD IS FALSE, I FEEL SOMETHING WITH|IN, WHICH PROVES THAT HIS WORD IS TRUE. THOUGH OTHERS CONSIGN SOUL AND BODY TO THE DUST, THE CLODS OF THE VALLEY CANNOT COVER MY SOUL. NO! LEGIONS OF ANGELS CAN'T CONFINE ME TO THE GRAVE.

<P>IN the vi&s;ions of the night, when deep &s;leep falleth upon man, methought I was tran&s;ported in|to a region beyond mortal view, and there beheld wonders, which no tongue can relate and no pen de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>But perhaps a faint de&s;cription may entertain the inqui&s;itive, may warm the cold, and lead the minds of the young and the aged, to that mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject, which excited my thoughts.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf on an exten&s;ive plain, &s;urround|ed by multitudes of people, all crowding forward. The throng was prodigious, and each neglectful of his neighbour, was only &s;olicitous to advance him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e were of all ages, &s;exes, colours, nations and languages on earth. A&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a mingled group, and wondering at the object of their zealous pur&s;uit, being unable to retire, and curious to be &s;atisfied, I pre&s;&s;ed forward with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When, lo! at once my eyes were &s;truck with the &s;ight of a magnificent building: It was large enough to contain all the families of the earth, and my fir&s;t thought was, that the Father of the uni|ver&s;e had erected it, that he might a&s;&s;emble in one place all his children. I was tran&s;ported with joy at being &s;o near the door of my father's hou&s;e. I had pa&s;&s;ed no valley of the &s;hadow of death, and imagined that the time was come, when from all
<PB N="54" REF="023207_0053_0FBE8040EC533E88">the winds of heaven, were collecting the &s;ons and daughters of the Lord Jehovah.</P>
<P>Elevated with the thought, I contemplated all the promi&s;es and prophecies of our religion; and was, for the time convinced, that this was no other than a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</P>
<P>On our arrival, I perceived that this building was &s;urrounded by numberle&s;s little chapels, into which the multitude crowded with eagerne&s;s. They &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, and I was left alone to examine the place. I found over each an in&s;cription. Some were &s;acred to Mahomet; &s;ome to Paul, Apollos and Cephas; and among the re&s;t, was a&s;toni&s;hed to find one to the unknown God; but more to &s;ee it crowded by innumerable votaries. While I was mu&s;ing upon the&s;e things, one, in the likene&s;s of a man, approached me, and &s;aid, "Know that this is the temple of religion. The chapel by which you &s;tand is frequented by tho&s;e, who have not God in their knowledge. The others are zealous partizans; their doors are ever thrown wide open, and there are &s;ome always at the entrance, to bec|kon in &s;trangers, and to increa&s;e their numbers. He then pointed me to &s;everal, who con&s;tantly em|ployed &s;ome of their number, compa&s;&s;ing &s;ea and land, to make pro&s;elytes." As we pa&s;&s;ed along, I was &s;olicited at every door to enter: per&s;ua&s;ive motives were u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e; for I was anxi|ous to get within the great temple. As we came round to the door, I perceived it locked, and over it, in plain letters&mdash;</P>
<P>TO GOD AND TO THE LAMB.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to my guide, why the doors were &s;hut. He replied, "This is a faint, earthly em|blem
<PB N="55" REF="023207_0054_0FBE80426DAAC7D8">of the things which &s;hall be hereafter; for in the city which is to come, there is no material temple, for the Lord God almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it; but here &s;hall, in no wi&s;e, enter any thing that defileth: for holine&s;s becomes God's hou&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands of tho&s;e, whom you have &s;een, are daily applying for admi&s;&s;ion; but few obtain it. The many plead their zeal in the &s;ervice of God; but this zeal is not according to knowledge. They plead their works; but the&s;e have been done to plea&s;e men, and not with a &s;ingle eye to the glory of the Giver of life. They plead their prayers and alms; but the&s;e have never come up in memorial before God; they have not fed the hungry, nor clothed the naked, nor vi&s;ited the &s;ick, nor the pri&s;oner. They have not &s;old their goods, and given to the poor; they have not comforted the mourner, nor afforded relief to the dying; but they have lived in luxury and vanity; they have hoard|ed up the mammon of this world; they have pam|pered their lu&s;ts and lived deceitfully. They have harboured malice, envy, hatred, bitterne&s;s, and ev|ery evil thing: yea, &s;ome have &s;aid there is no God, and have denied the Lord that bought them; yet with all the&s;e abominations, they wi&s;h to enter this holy temple. But how gladly would they re|turn to their parties and their lu&s;ts, rather than en|dure the &s;ociety of the happy beings within, for here, the high prai&s;es of God employ every tongue and gratitude to the Redeemer fills every heart. Their chapels are filled with men plea&s;ers, who &s;ay, Lord, Lord, merely to be heard of men, and lift up their eyes to heaven, that they may &s;eem to pray; but he, who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire,
<PB N="56" REF="023207_0055_0FBE8044F44D05D8">&s;ees their hypocri&s;y, and will cau&s;e them to fear and tremble in the day of his wrath.</P>
<P>While he was &s;peaking, the clouds had been gathering, and at this moment, the war of ele|ments began, and I was almo&s;t petrified with fear. Never was a &s;cene &s;o full of terror; yet my guide was calm and &s;erene, unruffled at the impending &s;torm. I noticed, as a fla&s;h of lightning gleamed acro&s;s his face, if &s;eemed to remain, and he &s;hone with the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, and appeared like a burning &s;eraph. Till this time of life, I had never known &s;uch an exce&s;s of fear. The rolling of a di&s;tant thunder had always filled me with a &s;olemn &s;erenity; but now in awful terror, the lightning fla&s;hed upon my a&s;toni&s;hed eyes, and the thunder, peal on peal, &s;eemed rending heaven and earth, ready to bur&s;t upon my devoted head. I had ju&s;t breath to cry for mercy. I fainted, fell, and &s;eemed to be no more&mdash;But I recovered, and at the moment of &s;tanding on my feet, was ha&s;ting for &s;helter, to one of tho&s;e chapels. All, &s;o far as I could &s;ee, were beckoning me to enter. As I was running towards them, on a &s;udden the thunder cra&s;hed them to atoms, and &s;ent to in&s;tant death all their votaries! But the great temple was unhurt, and appeared much more augu&s;t and mag|nificent, than when &s;urrounded by tho&s;e chapels. All was vi&s;ion, but to me &s;eemed reality. My guide, &s;eeing the agitation of my &s;oul, by the &s;cenes which had pa&s;&s;ed, took me by the hand, and &s;aid, "Know that I am the angel of charity, who am entru&s;ted with the keys of this temple," They, who were in tho&s;e chapels, thought them&s;elves &s;afe, and were triumphing over their neighbours, in the vain imagination, that their own hou&s;e &s;tood &s;trong,
<PB N="57" REF="023207_0056_0FBE804639763868">at the very moment when the thunder bur&s;t upon them. They would all have offered you &s;helter; but had you believed them, &s;ee where you would have been. Adore then that goodne&s;s which &s;truck you to the earth; for had your own &s;trength per|mitted, you would have been lying among yon ruins; he, who heareth prayer, heard your feeble cry for mercy, as you fell, and you are now alive, never to fear again; for behold! here he waved his hand towards the heavens, I ca&s;t up mine eyes, and lo! the clouds were di&s;per&s;ing, the rainbow of the covenant appeared, and in the mid&s;t one like unto the Son of man, "having on his head a crown of gold, and in his right hand &s;even &s;tars, and his countenance was as the &s;un &s;hined in his &s;trength," and he &s;aid with a voice of infinite mildne&s;s, and a look of ineffable tenderne&s;s, "In my father's hou&s;e are many man&s;ions."</P>
<P>At this moment the angel opened the door of the temple, and beckoned me to enter, &s;aying, Lo! here are they whom no thunders appal. They could look unmoved at the wreck of nature. They have all pa&s;&s;ed the &s;cene which you have endured, and are now perpetually &s;erene. Without you will be expo&s;ed to frequent &s;torms; for tho&s;e chapels, lo! they are already rebuilt, and will be again demoli&s;hed. To me they appeared indeed rebuilt on the old ruins, and the dead bodies. They &s;eemed larger than before, and all again filled.</P>
<P>The angel again beckoned me to enter. I fell upon my knees, with un&s;peakable humility, and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my demerit, &s;aying, "My heaven|ly Father, thou knowe&s;t that I am not worthy to enter under this roof; but I will for ever remain thus at the &s;teps of thine hou&s;e." The angel took
<PB N="58" REF="023207_0057_0FBE8047AA4FD538">me by the hand, and &s;aid, "Thy Saviour is worthy: thou ha&s;t given a cup of cold water to a di&s;ciple in his name; he is a faithful Saviour, and thou &s;halt not lo&s;e thy reward. Then he led me into THE TEMPLE OF RELIGION, WHERE, WITH FILIAL REVERENCE AND HEART|FELT AWE, I JOINED THE BLESSED SO|CIETY OF THOSE, WHOSE DAYS WERE DEVOTED, AND WHOSE HEARTS <HI>WERE DEDICATED TO THE SERVICE</HI> OF GOD AND THE LAMB.</P>

<P>I WAS &s;tanding by his bed, when he awoke from this vi&s;ion: his health was at this time wholly departed, and while awake, he was often the &s;ub|ject of acute pain. The fir&s;t words which he pronounced, &s;hewed that he had a confu&s;ed idea of being &s;till in a &s;chool, as he repeated</P>
<Q><L>My children round this temple throng</L>
<L>To &s;ee your ble&s;t Redeemer's face,</L>
<L>The &s;on of David be your &s;ong,</L>
<L>Let young Ho&s;annahs fill the place.</L></Q>
<P>Upon recovering he &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to pain; his &s;oul was healed, and he was calm. There was a divine mildne&s;s, and a placid &s;mile on his face. A cele&s;tial lu&s;tre &s;eemed to &s;parkle from his eyes, and he cea&s;ed to have a mortal look. I feared, for the moment, that his breath was about to leave
<PB N="59" REF="023207_0058_0FBE804C5CD51698">him, and was much affected with the thought; for our &s;ouls had been knit together. He recov|ered, but the vi&s;ion had nearly overpowered him. To him, it has had all the effect of reality, and he afterwards a&s;&s;ured me, that had I known all, there was no occa&s;ion for alarm; for if he appeared to be dying, it was but a few moments before, that he received the <HI>new breath,</HI> which can never leave him: that he then ju&s;t commenced to live the life of angels, and to anticipate the innocence, the knowledge, the holine&s;s and employments of heav|en. With his new breath, he received new lan|guage, to record which, is beyond my power. He talked with ec&s;tacy of the work of redemption, and ever reflected with Chri&s;tian gratitude, on the means of the Spirit, in bringing him to a <HI>&s;aving</HI> knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P>But when he &s;poke of the joy, which his arrival in heaven would afford his father, and how all the a&s;cended heirs of glory would rejoice at the return of a repenting &s;inner: When he conver&s;ed of tho&s;e with whom he &s;hould &s;pend an eternity, how would his eyes &s;tream with tears of rapture, <HI>Ye, who have experienced what Clio felt; ye, who are in Chri&s;t, his brethren and &s;i&s;ters, can be&s;t conceive his feelings and language.</HI></P>
<P>BY THIS HISTORY, MAY PARENTS BE INDUCED TO TRAIN UP THEIR CHILDREN IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD GO. MAY YOUTHS BE WARNED NOT TO INDULGE IN VAIN IMAGINATIONS ABOUT ETERNAL CONCERNS, AND MAY ALL BE PERSUAD|ED TO RELY ON THAT DIVINE SPIRIT, WHICH RAISED CLIO EVEN FROM THE DEPTHS OF INFI|DELITY, INTO THE ELEVATED RANK OF THE BRETHREN OF JESUS, AND INTO THE DISTIN|GUISHED HONOR OF THE SONS OF GOD.</P>
