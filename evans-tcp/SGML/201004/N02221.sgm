<P>This la&s;t Ca&s;e was that which Governed the opinion of the Council (when Judge <HI>Mem|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted) to declare that part of Col. <HI>Evan</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion void, which re&s;erved to the Proprietor the final A&s;&s;ent to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> he pa&s;&s;ed into Laws in this Province.

<P>The next thing ob&s;ervable in the above recited Clau&s;e of the Royal Charter, is the Right and Power of Legi&s;lation, granted to the Proprietor and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and to his and their

<P>But the Proprietor, pur&s;uant to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d recited Clau&s;e, made Charters which pre&s;cribed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of A&s;&s;embling the Free-men to act in Legi&s;lation after the Modes mentioned in the Memorial; and it may be the People were regardle&s;s of a new Charter after the Re|&s;ignation of the fir&s;t, not out of any liking they had to be conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned by Writs, but as the Right of Meeting together to make Laws was virtually in them by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid Royal Grant, &s;o the form of their Elections and A&s;&s;embling might be &s;ettled by Law, which was effected afterwards by an Act to A&s;certain the number of Members of A&s;&s;embly and to regulate Elections, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the fourth Year of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, and &s;ettled yearly Elections of Repre&s;entatives in A&s;&s;embly without Writs, and appointed the Time when and by whom tho&s;e Elections &s;hould be made, as al&s;o the Time of the A&s;&s;embly's Meeting, and how they &s;hould qualify them&s;elves to act, choo&s;e their Speaker, and be Judges of the Qualifications and Elections of their own Members, &s;it upon their own Adjourn|ments, appoint Committees, prepare Bills in order to pa&s;s into Laws, <HI>Impeach Criminals</HI> and redre&s;s Grievances <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By this Law and la&s;t Charter (wherein the Proprietary, according to his Right made one &s;ide of the agreement, which he could not alter or avoid without the Concurrence of the parties concerned on the other &s;ide) it is evident, That the whole Legi&s;lative Autho|rity here is lodged in the Governour and Repre&s;entatives of the People; and I have met none &s;o &s;encele&s;s as to &s;ay, that the Governour is thereby concluded of having a Council to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t in Legi&s;lation and other matter relating to the State, and I have known divers of the Members of that Board very &s;erviceable in that Station, and, I doubt not, may be &s;o &s;till, therefore I de&s;ire they may not withdraw from their Service nor in&s;i&s;t upon a Negative to the Acts of tho&s;e that Repre&s;ent them, which, by a rea&s;onable Con&s;truc|tion of the &s;aid Law and Charte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is lodged with the Governour, and is &s;o ve&s;ted in him by his Commi&s;&s;ion &s;tamped with the Royal Allowance and Authority of the King's Let|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs Patent, That the Proprietary could by no In&s;truction or other Act what&s;oever, with|out the Governour's Con&s;ent, dive&s;t him of his Right to Govern, unle&s;s by re&s;uming the Government or Deputing another in his &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d. And if the Governour has given any Bond or Covenant to ob&s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that abridge or re&s;train the Authority granted him by Commi&s;&s;ion to Exerci&s;e the Powers of Government in this Province, the &s;ame is void, as appears by the above cited Re&s;olutions, from whence it may be ob&s;erved how careful the Law is to keep Powers entire, as the be&s;t means to pre&s;erve good Order in States and Governments, where no &s;uch ab&s;urdity can be admitted, as to allow the Per&s;ons Repre|&s;ented to controul the Acts of their Repre&s;entatives, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Matters which the other Branch of the Legi&s;lature may think to be rea&s;onably Propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And altho' the Law declares, that Bonds and Covenants (given to Guard the Principal, when he would dimini&s;h or abridge the Power of his Deputy) are Repugnant to his Office, and therefore void and again&s;t Law, having a tendency to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny or delay Ju&s;tice (as in our Ca&s;e) yet, if the Governour came under any Security to ob&s;erve the Directions of the King's Grant, which forbids to depart from the Faith and Allegeance due to the King, or to maintain Corre&s;pondence with his Enemies, or to commit Ho&s;tility again&s;t &s;uch as are in League with him, or Tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the Laws of Trade, and Navigation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for di&s;charging of his Tru&s;t and Duty in the Admini&s;tration of the Government according to the purport of the &s;aid Royal Grant and the Laws and Con&s;titutions of this Province; I conceive that in tho&s;e Ca&s;es &s;uch Security is binding upon the Governour and will be mo&s;t effectual and available in Law, unle&s;s &s;ome illegal or repugnant Condition be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed thereunto.</P>
<P>As to the Power of making Ordinances with the a&s;&s;ertance of other Per&s;ons that the People's Delegates, it appears by the Patent, that tho&s;e Ordinances cannot be Extended, in any &s;ort, to bind change or take away the Right or Intere&s;t of any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons for or in their Life, Members, Free-hold, Goods or Chattels, nor are they directed to be made except &s;udden Accidents happen, whereto it may be nece&s;&s;ary to apply Remedy, before the Free-holders or their Delegates can be a&s;&s;embled to make Laws,&mdash;Be&s;ides our Law|makers (who ought to have Notice of &s;uch Occa&s;ions) may be convened as &s;oon as the Magi&s;trates and Officers of the re&s;pective Counties, who are to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making Ordinan|ces: But if the Ordinance-makers &s;hould happen to get the &s;tart; yet when the Delegates of the People come together and acquaint the Governour of their readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the publick Service of the Government, and to an&s;wer the Exigences thereof, I think the Power of making Ordinances &s;hould then be waved, and the Legi&s;lative Authority applyed to, becau&s;e their Acts are deemed more Exten&s;ive and Binding, as appears by the expre&s;s Words of the &s;aid Patent.</P>
