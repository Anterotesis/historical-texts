<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>SATURDAY, April</HI> 1, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS country is now reduced to a &s;ituation really degrading and deplorable, through the &s;trange ob&s;tinacy and week prejudices of the King, who is determined, even at the ri&s;k of his own &s;afety, the pre&s;ervation of the king|dom, and contrary to the united voice of his peo|ple, to encourage and protect an abandoned &s;et of men in the de&s;truction of that con&s;titution he was &s;worn to &s;upport and defend.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory fatally informs us, that the Engli&s;h have been driven to extremes, by cau&s;es of le&s;s moment than tho&s;e which have &s;haken this kingdom during the pre&s;ent reign.</P>
<P>Since the la&s;t &s;tupendous Revolution, it has been generally believed, that the nature of our con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="82" REF="013973_0002_0F925A06C0E71828">became clearly a&s;certained, and fixed on firmer and more la&s;ting principles than it had known be|fore that glorious aera; at lea&s;t the obtaining the&s;e ends, as well as redre&s;&s;ing grievances, are acknow|ledged to be the motives to the tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times. For had the exorbitant power of the crown been left unlimited and un&s;ettled, as before that event, and the liberties and privileges of the &s;ub|jects of England, in the &s;ame undecided &s;tate; it would have been only to change the name of ma&s;|ters, and not the nature of their &s;overeignty. And if, in&s;tead of removing the cau&s;e of our &s;ufferings, and fixing our rights and liberties, we then gave to a Hou&s;e of Commons, an unlimited power to di&s;po&s;e of the la&s;t, according to their inclination, it was only changing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of arbitrary power, by granting to a pro&s;tituted &s;et of repre|&s;entatives what was denied the King; and thus this illu&s;trious action of the Revolution mu&s;t ap|pear to be the re&s;ult of the faction, and aver&s;ion to one intere&s;t, or unwarrantable zeal for another. In what manner can a nation be more &s;ettled in its freedom, by transferring arbitrary power from one part of the con&s;titution to another.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that the laws, which were then enacted to e&s;tabli&s;h upon a foundation not to be again &s;haken, the freedom of the Engli&s;h nation, and the liberties of the people ought to be con&s;idered, as unalterable, the very ba&s;is and boun|dary of the King's prerogative, and the rights of Engli&s;hmen, &s;omething in the government like the center in the earth, the fixed point, round which all things move, and to which they tend.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e acts which were made at the Revolution, relative to the con&s;titution, &s;uch as the bill of
<PB N="83" REF="013973_0003_0F925A07D7DCD748">rights, and afterwards in con&s;equence of it the act of &s;ettlement, which may be ju&s;tly deemed the compact between the Hou&s;e of Hanover and the people of England, and which was pre&s;erved invi|olate, till broken by the unhallowed hands of the pre&s;ent Sovereign and his mini&s;ters, are undoubt|edly of a nature more &s;acred than tho&s;e which e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a turnpike road.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e acts, founded on our former rights in Magna Charta, ought to be con&s;idered as the e&s;|&s;ential authority by which the Hou&s;e of Commons exi&s;ts, than laws which a Parliament may abro|gate, through pure inclination to indulge a King or his Mini&s;ters, to make them de&s;potic, and the people mi&s;erable; for it mu&s;t appear &s;trangely ab|&s;urd in a con&s;titution, that the repre&s;entatives of the people, who form a third part of it, &s;hould be authorized by them to de&s;troy their liberties, and thereby exclude them from the rights which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in the government of the kingdom? Be|&s;ides, it is contrary to the very idea of a free &s;tate, that a people &s;hould have given a power of &s;acri|ficing their privileges to men cho&s;en the guardi|ans of them.</P>
<P>Something mu&s;t exi&s;t in a free &s;tate, which no part of it can be authori&s;ed to alter or de&s;troy, otherwi&s;e the idea of a con&s;titution cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for unle&s;s we allow the freeholders and electors of Great Britain to be &s;uperior to a Hou&s;e of Com|mons, we grant to them an ab&s;olute power, a power incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of a free peo|ple, and de&s;tructive of the principles of a mixed government.</P>
<P>Should it be acknowledged, that though the Commons have exerci&s;ed a power of annihilating many privileges and rights belonging to the peo|ple,
<PB N="84" REF="013973_0004_0F925A087564C708">and that they po&s;&s;e&s;s no legal title to it, then all laws &s;ubver&s;ive of Magna Charta, the bill of rights, act or &s;ettlement, and &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, are an exce&s;s of their authority, and a violation of their tru&s;t, for which the pre&s;ent infamous parliament ought not only to be di&s;&s;ol|ved, but every member who vi&s;ibly engaged in the de&s;truction of the peoples rights, &s;hould &s;uf|fer death, together with tho&s;e helli&s;h mini&s;ters who formed a de&s;ign of en&s;laving the people; and it mu&s;t be equally ju&s;t, as well as nece&s;&s;ary, to call to a &s;trict account the fir&s;t magi&s;trate, who could be ba&s;e enough to encourage the de&s;truction of our liberties, and a &s;ubver&s;ion of the noble&s;t con&s;titution in the world, as an example to future Kings and mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>If any mini&s;terial hireling &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that our repre&s;entatives, after the hour of election are no longer an&s;werable for their conduct, and are le|gally inve&s;ted with authority to de&s;troy our rights and liberties at their plea&s;ure, then what did King James do more than by this his prerogative? And of what advantage has the Revolution proved to us, if &s;ubverting the con&s;titution be legally placed in the hands of the repre&s;entatives? In what &s;en&s;e does the idea of a free &s;tate, or the liberty of the people exi&s;t, when it depends upon nothing more permanent or e&s;tabli&s;hed than the vague, rapacious, or intere&s;ted inclination of a majority of five hundred and fifty eight men, open to the in&s;idious attacks of a weak or de&s;ign|ing Prince, and his mini&s;ters? Surely it will be granted, that whether King or mini&s;ter, who by undue influence &s;hould prevail in pa&s;&s;ing laws &s;ubver&s;ive of the &s;tatutes before mentioned, mu&s;t be deemed an offender again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;acred of
<PB N="85" REF="013973_0005_0F925A0CD263F648">all human enjoyments, liberty and the con&s;titu|tion of his country, and equally criminal with James the &s;econd and his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The whole pre&s;umptive title a parliament can pretend to have of di&s;po&s;ing of our rights and privileges can be but prerogative, which in many in&s;tances has been illegally carried beyond the li|mits of liberty and the con&s;titution. It is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould recur to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution with the &s;tricte&s;t rigour and per&s;eve|rance.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on that can be given, why our forefathers, in the antient fundamental &s;tatutes of the realm, have delivered nothing verbally expli|cit on this head of limiting the power of their repre&s;entatives, derives it origin from the &s;ame cau&s;e that the Romans had no laws again&s;t parri|cide, they never conceived that the thought of betraying or &s;elling a peoples liberties, any more than murdering a father could enter the human heart; they never imagined that the repre&s;enta|tive could ever po&s;&s;e&s;s an intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of his con&s;tituent, or that pecuniary advan|tage could outweigh the public good in his brea&s;t; they did not fore&s;ee that mini&s;ters might have occa&s;ion to oppre&s;s us, for the gratification of a weak or wicked Prince; or that Engli&s;hmen, no longer animated by the &s;oul of public pro&s;perity, might degenerate into granting oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, till the nation would be brought within one &s;tep of ruin; or that laws, e&s;&s;ential to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of freedom and &s;ecurity of the &s;tate, could be made to bur&s;t at the mandate of a mini&s;ter, by the breath of a majority of five hundred and fifty eight men.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="013973_0006_0F925A0E49FACF40">
When the repre&s;entatives of the people act con|trary to the very elements of the con&s;titution, betray and give up the rights, privileges, and liberties of the people, though nothing in the fundamental &s;tatutes literally prohibit &s;o ignominious a behavi|our; the very nature of their &s;tation, the innate &s;en&s;e of right, and original &s;pirit of government, directly contradict all po&s;&s;ibility of their having title for &s;uch proceedings; and whenever it is done, it is an unju&s;t and wanton exertion of power, and not of authority; add to this dread|ful and heinous crime the indignant and humilia|ting con&s;ideration, that our equals whom we choo&s;e to &s;erve, have &s;old us like our cattle to a weak (not to &s;ay wor&s;e) King, and his accur&s;ed mini&s;ters, who have paid our betrayers with a part of that money which was mo&s;t unju&s;tly levied on us, not to an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ity of govern|ment, but for the mo&s;t infamous and villanous purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The particulars mentioned in the bill of rights at the Revolution, were then con&s;idered as &s;o many violations committed by King James, on the privileges of the people, and nece&s;&s;ary to be remedied for the &s;ake of &s;ecuring our religion, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty and the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The grievances, at that time complained of again&s;t the Sovereign, had their foundation in ju&s;tice, and the rights of the people and the redre&s;&s;ing them in the nature of the con&s;titution; otherwi&s;e, by what arguments could be a&s;&s;igned a cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t the Prince on the throne, or pre&s;erve tho&s;e men, who accompli&s;hed the Revolution, from the imputation of traitors and rebels to their King.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="013973_0007_0F925A0F02F18270">
They con&s;idered the con&s;titution as the primary object of an Engli&s;hman, and the King but as the &s;econdary; who, by his attempts towards de&s;poti&s;m, became a rebel again&s;t this &s;uperior power. They ju&s;tly rea&s;oned, that as the people, who made a third of the con&s;titution, are deemed traitors for plotting or attempting the life of, or taking up arms again&s;t the King, who forms another third of the con&s;titution, and doomed to death in con|&s;equence of &s;uch behavior, in like manner King JAMES rebelled again&s;t two thirds of the go|vernment, by attempting to &s;ubvert their religion and liberties; for our con&s;titution &s;uppo&s;es, that each part of it has a right to be pre&s;erved; that two are more than one, and the happine&s;s of a whole people to be pre&s;erved, in preference to the ambition or pernicious pa&s;&s;ion or de&s;igns of a King.</P>
<P>Shall then the pre&s;ent Sovereign and his mini|&s;ters be exempted from a &s;trict and nice inquiry into their conduct, becau&s;e they have effected in one method the very de&s;poti&s;m which was oppo&s;ed in James, who was de&s;ervedly drove into exile, for attempting it in another. Forbid it, Heaven! And every thing that is dear to Engli&s;hmen!</P>
