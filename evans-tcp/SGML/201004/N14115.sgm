<HEAD>TO THE PEOPLE AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.</HEAD>
<P>THE following publication is intended to convey a few ob&s;er|vations to my fellow citizens, on a new <HI>Society or In&s;titution</HI> lately e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the continent, compo&s;ed of the Major-Generals, Brigadiers, and other Officers of our army. It is in&s;tituted by the name of "THE SOCIETY OF THE CIN|CINNATI;" and it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to con&s;iderable &s;trength and matu|rity already. For be&s;ides the Grand or <HI>General Society</HI> of this order, a &s;ubordinate or <HI>State Society</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed in each &s;tate, and the&s;e again &s;ubdivided "into &s;uch di&s;tricts as &s;hall be directed by the State So|cieties. The General Society is to be held on the fir&s;t Monday in May annually, &s;o long as they &s;hall deem nece&s;&s;ary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and after|wards at lea&s;t once in every three years. The &s;tate Societies are to meet the fourth of July annually, or oftner, if they &s;hall find it ex|pedient."</P>
<P>Major-General Baron Steuben is appointed <HI>Grand Ma&s;ter of the Order,</HI> under the more humble title of <HI>Pre&s;ident;</HI> and each State Society as well as the Grand one has al&s;o its Pre&s;ident, Vice-Pre&s;ident, Secre|tary, Trea&s;urer and Vice Trea&s;urer. Annual communications of the States with each other, by circular letters are enjoined: "And the General Meeting of the Society, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of its officers, and a repre&s;entation from each &s;tate in number not ex|ceeding five: who&s;e expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces &s;hall be borne by the re&s;pective State Societies." So that here are delegates to be &s;ent to form a general convention or congre&s;s of the order. They have al&s;o in|&s;tituted a badge of honour, or what they call "an Order by which its members &s;hall be known and di&s;tingui&s;hed. It is a medal of gold in the figure of an eagle, with an in&s;cription on the face and rever&s;e, alluding to the time of e&s;tabli&s;hing the order, and to their having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed the republic. And this badge of di&s;tinction, is to be &s;u&s;pended by a deep blue ribbon two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">es wide, edged with white, de&s;criptive of the Union between America and France." and to be worn by each member, as the French and Briti&s;h nobility wear their &s;tars and ribbons, the in&s;ignia of their peerage. They have already conferred the honour and freedom of their Order on his excellency the French Amba&s;&s;ador, his excellency the Sieur Gerard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, the count d'E&s;taing, count de Gra&s;&s;e, count de Barras, the chevalier de Touches, count Rochambeau, and the generals and colonels of his army. And it is reported that &s;everal crowned heads and princes in Eu|rope, are to dignify it by becoming honorary members of it. Con|gre&s;s for political rea&s;ons no doubt, winks at it; and no one &s;tate, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> body of men in any one of them, have given it the lea&s;t oppo&s;i|tion. The di&s;cretion of the commander in chief, which I take to be his di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic, is &s;ignal on this occa&s;ion; for he has appeared quite neutral in this bu&s;ine&s;s, if we except his becom|ing
<PB N="3" REF="017863_0003_0FA373B821B574A0">an honorary member of it. I believe the officers do not declare them&s;elves to each other; and that on this occa&s;ion, there is too much truth in the remark of an able philo&s;opher, "that there is no man who lets his neare&s;t friend &s;ee the bottom of his heart."</P>
<P>The more I reflect on this in&s;titution, and the political con&s;equen|ces it will involve, the more am I filled with a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;elf created as it is, and coming upon us in &s;o bold and que&s;tionable an appearance, &s;o deeply planned, and clo&s;ely executed, yet that it &s;hould have been &s;o little attended to, that it is not even the &s;ubject of private conver&s;ation. Could I for a moment view this Order with indifference, it would be impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;mile, to behold the po|pulace of America, in their town committees and town meetings, &s;o keenly bent on petty mi&s;chiefs, in full cha&s;e and cry after a few in&s;ignifican tories, and running on regardle&s;s of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which ere long mu&s;t &s;trip the po&s;terity of the middling and lower cla&s;&s;es of every influence or authority, and leave them nothing but in&s;ignificance, contempt, and the wretched privilege of murmuring when it is too late. So thoughtle&s;s are the multitude!</P>
<P>My de&s;ign at pre&s;ent is to &s;hew, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> What this Order or Society &s;eems to be; in the next place, To demon&s;trate what it really is, and will turn out to be; and la&s;tly, To prove there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of extirpating it altogether.</P>
<P>From the out&s;ide appearance of their <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> or in&s;trument of writing which combines this Order, and which has been &s;ent thro' the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ates by circular letters, it is nothing more than an <Q>A&s;&s;ocia|tion, Con&s;titution, and Combination of the Generals, and other Officers of the Army, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved three years, or were derang|ed by Congre&s;s, into a Society of Friends, to perpetuate the memo|ry of the Revolution, and their own mutual friend&s;hip; to endure as long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they &s;hall endure, <HI>or any of their elde&s;t ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e poperity:</HI> and in failure thereof, <HI>the collateral branches who may be judged worthy of becoming its &s;upporters and members:</HI> To attend ince&s;&s;antly to pre&s;erve inviolate the exalted rights and liberties of human nature: for which they fought and bled. To promote and cheri&s;h between the re&s;pective &s;tates, Union and National Honor: To render permanent, cordial affecti|on, and the &s;pirit of brotherly kindne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s among the officers: To ex|tend acts of beneficence towards tho&s;e officers and their families who may unfortunately be under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving it.</Q> They advance each a mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s pay, and open a door for donations from others not of the &s;ociety, and for the charitable purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a fund, as well as for the <HI>political</HI> one, of engaging the leading men of each &s;tate in the intere&s;ts of the Order, they have the following rule; <Q>And as there will at all time, be men in the re&s;pective &s;tates, emi|nent for their abilities and patrioti&s;m, who&s;e views may be direct|ed to the &s;ome laudable objects with tho&s;e of the Cincinnati; it &s;hall be a rule to admit &s;uch characters, as honorary members of the &s;o|ciety for their own lives only: Provided that the number of the ho|norary members does not exceed a ratio of one to four of the officers and their de&s;cendents.</Q></P>
<P>The quotations I have made are the words of the General <HI>A&s;&s;oci|ation:</HI> &s;o that it &s;eems to be the offspring of patrioti&s;m, friend&s;hip, and humanity. And that many of the officers who have not clo&s;ely viewed the &s;ubject, favour it from tho&s;e principles, I have no doubt. But as &s;everal of them are equal in knowledge and abilities to any men in America, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible but that &s;ome of them mu&s;t &s;ee into the nature and con&s;equences of the in&s;titution. For, to come to the &s;econd part of my argument, it is in reality, and will turn out to be, <HI>an hereditary peerage;</HI> a nobility to them and their <HI>male
<PB N="4" REF="017863_0004_0FA373B88680EAC0">i&s;&s;ue,</HI> and in default thereof, to the <HI>collateral branches:</HI> what the lawyers would call&mdash;A title of peerage of Cincinnati to them and their heirs male, remainder to their heirs general.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth article of our confederation &s;ays, "Nor &s;hall the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, nor any of them grant any title of nobility." But the order of Cincinnati u&s;urp a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">obrlity without gift or grant, in defiance of Congre&s;s and the &s;tates, as I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently. And though the order cannot, at pre&s;ent be &s;anctified by legal authority, yet t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> makes nothing again&s;t the con&s;equences which will en&s;ue. Though the Order is &s;elf-created, and an in|fringement of a general law of the Union; yet if the courage of the officers does not fail them: if they but keep up with firmne&s;s and per&s;everance again&s;t oppo&s;ition, for this will be but trifling, &s;o un|thinking are the people; if they have but patience, &s;ubtilty, and addre&s;s to cloke their de&s;ign under a pious name of rai&s;ing a chari|table fund; &s;o as to make it go down only for a few years; even of they are obliged from policy to lay a&s;ide the <HI>badge and blue ribbon:</HI> My life for it, they will have lei&s;ure to laugh at, and ma&s;ter their op|ponents. And the next generation will drink as deep of noble blood, and a hereditary peerage be as firmly &s;ettled in each potent family, and rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted in our government, as any order of nobility is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">narchies of Europe. This Order is planted in a fiery, hot ambi|tion, and thir&s;t for power; and its branches will end in tyranny. The Cincinnati will &s;oon be corrupted, and the &s;pirit of the people depre&s;&s;ed; for in le&s;s than a century it will occa&s;ion &s;uch an inequa|lity in the condition of our inhabitants, that the country will be compo&s;ed only of two ranks of men; the patricians or nobles, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abble. This is the natural re&s;ult of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, who&s;e departure is &s;o &s;udden from our open profe&s;&s;ions of republicani&s;m, that it mu&s;t give a thinking mind mo&s;t melancholy forebodings. This creating of a nobility, and breaking through our con&s;titution, ju&s;t as we were &s;etting out in the world, is making that liberty which the Almighty has given us, a means for feeding our pride; and turning the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence into a cur&s;e upon us.</P>
<P>Had this order been created by Congre&s;s or our own legi&s;lature, even in violation of the confederation and of our laws, I &s;hould not think it a matter of &s;uch moment dukes, earls, or peers of the Cin|cinnati, &s;anctified by an act of A&s;&s;embly or of Congre&s;s, would be under&s;tood by all of us. Their preten&s;ions and exclu&s;ive privileges, the mode of their trial for life and death, &amp;c. a&s;certained. But the &s;elf-created Cincinnati, like a proud imperious man, would &s;et no bounds to its claims. Jealous that it held not any thing on its own ambitious terms, as they had cut and carved titles for them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, they would be &s;till gra&s;ping for every thing, and ri&s;ing from one u&s;urpation to another, as they &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Let us examine the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;ons for in&s;tituting the Cincin|nati. Fir&s;t, "to perpetuate the remembrance of the revolution." But will not the hi&s;torian more effectually tran&s;mit to po&s;terity, the memory of the revolution, and the illu&s;trious actions atchieved in bringing it about? And as to "pre&s;erving inviolate the exalted rights of human nature; the&s;e rights will in my opinion be much better pre&s;erved inviolate by having no <HI>di&s;tinct order</HI> of patricians or nobility among us: which, however thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the throne of a prince, or form a barrier between him and his peo|ple, is a bane and a cur&s;e to a republic; for unle&s;s you de&s;troy the one, you cannot have the other.</P>
<P>Again. They will "attend ince&s;&s;antly to pre&s;erve inviolate the exalted rights of human nature." Are there then, mo&s;t illu&s;trious
<PB N="5" REF="017863_0005_0FA373B947B73458">Cincinnati, two &s;orts of rights belonging to human nature? Is there one kind, &s;ubordinate, and on a level with the humble condition of Plebeians? and others <HI>more exalted,</HI> which the citizens are incapable of pre&s;erving inviolate, without the <HI>ince&s;&s;ant watching</HI> of a dignified or|der of patricians? They mu&s;t mean this or nothing. The people of America, it &s;eems, are not fit to be tru&s;ted with their own <HI>national honor,</HI> or their own affairs, unle&s;s the Order takes the &s;uperintend|ence and direction of them. Can contradiction be more &s;trong and glaring? In one moment they in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;titute an order, and rai&s;e a <HI>di&s;tinction,</HI> which looks down, as from an high mountain, on all beneath them: They have laid in ruins that fine, plain, level &s;tate of civil equality, over which the &s;ight of the beholder pa&s;&s;ed with plea&s;ure: which God laid out for our u&s;e and happine&s;s, and which our Laws and the nature of a Republican government promi&s;ed us: They have violated all; yet in the &s;ame breath, by way of a ma&s;k thrown over their doings, they &s;pread before us the fine words la&s;t quoted. But the di&s;gui&s;e is too thin: for in the name of Heaven, can any man in his &s;en&s;es believe that the remaining rights of the people which are yet left untouched, will not be in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and violated, by men, who di&s;daining the condition of private citizens, as below them, left it, and mounted up to the elevated and exclu&s;ive dignity of hereditary title?</P>
<P>But &s;ay they, "an order of nobility will give &s;trength, duration, and reverence to our government." Has not the war of America, I &s;ay, convinced mankind that &s;ociety in the mo&s;t trying conjunc|tures, and fierce&s;t dangers, can do better without them? When we fir&s;t &s;et out we had &s;carcely a di&s;tinction among us: for the body of our people was chiefly compo&s;ed of Yeomanry. But though they had no titles nor badges, they &s;oon produced excellent officers, &s;ol|diers and &s;tate&s;men: and every corner of America, at this moment, abounds with men, as well militia as continentals, as capable of command in cavalry or infantry, as any regular officers Europe can boa&s;t of. This military virtue of our citizens: their &s;en&s;e of digni|ty and contempt of danger; the gallant efforts they made; was not this, I &s;ay, the offspring of the equality and independent temper of men, who fought for them&s;elves, and not for ma&s;ters; and who&s;e &s;pirit was not trammeled or broken down by the oppre&s;&s;ion of an in&s;olent nobility? This was that warm animating pride which di&s;|dained to look up to any human creature as a &s;uperior, which rai&s;|ed us armies, and fought campaigns without pay or covering: efforts &s;o glorious, as never were, nor can po&s;&s;ibly be made by any nation where a nobility have got a con&s;iderable footing.</P>
<P>But if this order prevails in our country, the generous gallant virtues of the pre&s;ent day will &s;oon be extingui&s;hed, never to appear again. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lu&s;t calls <HI>the common di&s;ea&s;e of a nobility,</HI> nobilitatis com|mune malum &s;uperbia &amp; contemptor animus; <HI>pride and in&s;olence</HI> on the one hand, and oppre&s;&s;ion and cringing habits on the other, will break the &s;pirit of our children to &s;uch a degree of deba&s;ement, they would &s;hortly be impre&s;&s;ed in good earne&s;t with the idea, that the independence of America was from the beginning ordained: that &s;uch an effu&s;ion of human life and human blood: &s;o great a vari|ety of glorious atchievements and honourable &s;ufferings through the war: that all this I &s;ay was effected, not for the good of the people, but for a few families to aggrandize them&s;elves, and mo|nopolize the power of the continent, and to enjoy the fruits of it.</P>
<P>The other pretext is, "to promote and cheri&s;h between the re|&s;pective &s;tates, Union and National Honour." But I have the ho|nour to tell Baron Steuben, that though an order of peerage may
<PB N="6" REF="017863_0006_0FA373BA08ADAE00">do very well under the petty princes of Germany, yet in America it is incompatible with our freedom; and in&s;tead of being a bond of <HI>political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> it would on a future day, prove a &s;ource of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;|&s;en&s;ion and mi&s;ery:</HI> by e&s;tabli&s;hing two <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> orders; one who&s;e foun|dation is the <HI>Army;</HI> the other compo&s;ed of the <HI>Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onalt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Thus it opens a theatre for ignominous di&s;tinctious, for jealou&s;y and hatred, and ends in civil war, between the&s;e patricians and the people, if the latter had any &s;pirit left. And as the Order would be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by time, the world in le&s;s than an hundred years, would find its de&s;cendants a race of men di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of &s;ociety, with the eyes of all fixed upon them, as objects of &s;uch wor&s;hip, that it is not at all improbable, but our children &s;hould find the Order foi&s;ting the divinity of their in&s;titution into our pulpits, un|der a <HI>jure d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vino</HI> title. In a few generations hence, &s;uch are the ex|travagancies which enter into the heart of man, the peers of Cin|cinnati might confider them&s;elves as deriving their lineage from heaven&punc; Let us examine the &s;tory of tho&s;e heroes celebrated in the two immortal poems of Homer and Virgil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trip it of the bewitch|ing charms of poetry and you &s;hall find they afford not a better foundation for idolatry and the Yahoo-like wor&s;hip of men, than the peers of our Order. The courage of Hector, engaged in de|fence of his country again&s;t a foreign inva&s;ion: The valour of Achilles in avenging an in&s;ult to his nation: The piety of Aeneas in &s;aving his father and a few images of the Trojan Gods out of the ruins of his native city: I &s;peak agreeable to truth and com|mon &s;en&s;e, when I &s;ay that all the&s;e exploits have been equalled by the Cincinnati. And it is equally probable that they would produce in &s;ome future generation of American plebeians, &s;uch an admiration and idolatry, that would in the fervor of its operation, as in Rome of old, enable &s;ome leading man of the Order to &s;et up a tyranny. Some &s;ycophant poet would not be wanting to pro&s;ti|ture the talents which God gave him, for the vile purpo&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bing with divinity, as Virgil did Augu&s;tus, a tyrant who had &s;wallowed up the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>The Cincinnati at any rate would &s;oon <HI>have and hold</HI> an exclu&s;ive right to offices, honors and authorities, civil and military&punc; And the whole country be&s;ides them&s;elves, a mere mob of plebeians, without weight or e&s;timation; degraded in the eyes of our patrici|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, as the Roman people were by their republican nobility.

Ari&s;ing &s;olely from the ignominious <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> between the Commons, and the Patricians, as an hereditary order: who from the expul&s;ion of the Tarquins, to the time of the Grac|chi, about 300 years, produced &s;uch perpetual di&s;cord and tumults in that republic, that nothing but its good fortune and military virtue pre&s;erved it &s;o long from de&s;truction. At la&s;t when the people became corrupted, their di&s;&s;entions &s;welled to open rupture, or civil war. Sylla heading the nobility, and Marius the commons, The latter being compleatly vanqui&s;hed, the conqueror, as per|petual dictator, &s;et up a tyranny; and exerci&s;ed confi&s;cation, ba|ni&s;hment, and every other &s;pecies of cruelty which marks a di&s;or|derly people. Still civil di&s;cord admitted of no ce&s;&s;ation; for in a &s;hort time afterwards, the fire broke out with multiplied fury,
<PB N="7" REF="017863_0007_0FA373BAC84DDAC0">under Cae&s;ar, the leader of the commons, and Pompey, at the head of the nobility. The event is well known; Cae&s;ar triumph|ed over his adver&s;ary, and over the liberty of his fellow citizens; and the whole ended in a cruel de&s;poti&s;m. And thus &s;o many wars carried on&mdash;&s;o many illu&s;trious actions performed by that gallant people, only to gratify the ambition of an order, &s;imilar to the Cincinnati, but in its origin by no means &s;o re&s;pectable, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew; and finally to become the &s;laves of barbarous ma&s;ters, the Roman Emperors.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew plain notorious facts, to prove, that the in|&s;titution of this nobility is not the way to promote and cheri&s;h <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Natural Honour.</HI> Out of it will ari&s;e <HI>di&s;cord</HI> and not <HI>union.</HI> And that the people &s;hould, without &s;o much as &s;aying a word a|bout the matter, behold this poi&s;onous <HI>exotic</HI> plant taking root throughout the land. That they &s;hould commit &s;uch a vile abu&s;e of their liberty as to allow it, is a reproach upon human nature; and would, in the eyes of po&s;terity, be a national di&s;honour to us. I have often thought that the revolution in America would reduce it to a certainty, whether mankind was de&s;tined by nature for li|berty or flavery, for a republican government never before has had, what we call fair play, in any part of the globe. But the Order of Cincinnati would give a fatal wound to civil liberty thro' the world, and prove that all that Plato, Sidney, Locke and others have bequeathed to po&s;terity on the &s;ubject of political happine&s;s, though appearing well on paper, yet was no more than ideal pic|tures of a &s;ine magination. Our example too would &s;erve to &s;trengthen tyranny in Europe, by evincing that a people brought up under a monarchy, and accu&s;tomed to be governed by others, are too degenerate to govern them&s;elves in a &s;tate of liberty and that after all we have done, we &s;till keep a hankering after the or|ders, titles and trumpery we have been u&s;ed to under the royal government, where the people are &s;o bewitched, that abilities, virtue or wealth it&s;elf, are not &s;uch objects of reverence as a &s;tar or ribbon.</P>
<P>The following clau&s;e of the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> I think an extraordinary one. <Q>The officers of the American army having generally been taken from the citizens of America, po&s;&s;e&s;s high veneration for the character o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at illu&s;trious Roman, Lucius Quintus Cineinnatus; and being re&s;olved to follow his example, by returning to their ci|tizen&s;hip, they think they may with propriety denominate them|&s;elves the &s;ociety of the Cincinnati.</Q></P>
<P>Then as they were taken from the citizens, why in the name of God not be contented "to return to citizen&s;hip," without u&s;urping an hereditary order? or with what "propriety can they denominate" them&s;elves from Cincinnatus, with an ambition &s;o renk, as to aim at nothing le&s;s, than <HI>Otrum cum dignitate, "retirement and a peerage?"</HI> Did that virtuous Roman, having &s;ubdued the ene|mies of his country, and returned home to tend his vineyard and plant his cabbages, did he confer an hereditary order of peerage on him&s;elf and his fellow &s;oldiers? I an&s;wer, No; it was more than he dared to do. For a le&s;s crime, that republic, in the days of its liberty, put to death, bani&s;hed or di&s;graced &s;ome of her citizens, as illu&s;trious and renowned as any we have, without exception.</P>
<P>The Romans had learned from &s;ad experience, a le&s;&s;on which &s;eems to be brought home to our&s;elves in the example before me; that military commanders acquiring fame, and accu&s;tomed to re|ceive the obedience of armies, are generally in their hearts ari&s;to|craties, and enemies to the popular equality of a republic. That
<PB N="8" REF="017863_0008_0FA373BB877BF078">becoming illu&s;trious by their &s;ervices, they are ever ready, under plau&s;able appearances of <HI>ju&s;tice and merit,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume u&s;urpations of of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency. The people fir&s;t adore them with a &s;tupid veneration, which &s;wells their pride; enables them to form factions; procure followers; create di&s;tinctions; aggrandize their families; &s;plit the &s;tate into divi&s;ions, and like Cae&s;ar, Cromwell, and others, under the &s;moke they had created, rai&s;e them&s;elves to de&s;poti&s;m. This is the rea&s;on that in wi&s;e republics, &s;uch citizens were &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly put out of the way; bani&s;hed their country; or excluded from dignities or influence. And their fame and eclat was thought an ample reward to con&s;ole them under it. It is probable therefore that it was as much through fear, as repub|lican virtue, that Cincinnatus and his officers were re&s;trained from in&s;tituting a new order; for I do not &s;uppo&s;e they were either bet|ter or wor&s;e than our own. Only that republic had wi&s;e laws t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bridle the ambition and controul the factions of potent citizens, and we have as yet no &s;uch laws.</P>
<P>I know it will be denied, that the Order is, what I do holdly a&s;|&s;ert it to be, an <HI>hereditary peerage.</HI> Some of its members a&s;&s;ume the cloak of political mode&s;ty, and under it talk, that they are no more dangerous than a city corporation of "&s;hop-keepers, taylors, or other mechanics; or like the Free Ma&s;ons and other clubs who wear badges or medals." Here we &s;ee how ambition can a&s;&s;ume all &s;hapes and colours; and humble it&s;elf to the very du&s;t to accompli&s;h its purpo&s;e! This moment take upon them the &s;uperintendence of empire, the <HI>honour, union and happine&s;s of nations,</HI> and the <HI>exalted rights of human nature;</HI> and the very next, pro&s;trate them&s;elves to the level of men, with whom to be compared on any other occa&s;ion, the Or|der would deem an in&s;ult. I &s;ay, that a body of military com|manders, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of &s;ociety under an in&s;titution founded on the illu&s;trious actions of &s;o &s;ingular a revolution as that of America: inve&s;ted with the exclu&s;ive privilege of wearing a badge of their order, honourable to them&s;elves, as it is ignomini|ous to the people; elevated above others, and in parity among them&s;elves: The&s;e, I &s;ay, are peers of the realm, <HI>pares regni,</HI> and nothing more or le&s;s. And that this order being entailed on the <HI>male i&s;&s;ue,</HI> and in default thereof, on the <HI>collateral line,</HI> makes it <HI>heredi|tary.</HI> And whether it be in&s;tituted by the legi&s;lature, who alone have the legal power to do it, or be u&s;urped by the officers, it makes no difference in its con&s;equences. For as I ob&s;erved before, in one generation the order of Cincinnati will be e&s;tabli&s;hed im|moveably. The rank, number and influence of the members; the remembrance of their glorious actions, &s;till heightened by the pro|pen&s;ity of mankind to the marvellous: all this, I &s;ay, will rai&s;e the order to grandeur, antiquity, veneration and arbitrary power; ac|qui&s;itions which will become here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the peerage, and once obtained, not one family of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ever think of renouncing.</P>
<P>But in &s;upport of the order, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be alledged, that the &s;tates cannot pay the army, the officers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l be contented with this <HI>bau|ble,</HI> and they will not abu&s;e it. "'Tis like throwing a tub to a whale," &s;ay they. Should the &s;tates commit &s;uch a national ini|quity, as not to pay their army, they merit eternal infamy, and to be <HI>peer-ridden</HI> into the bargain. And as to the officers re&s;ting &s;ati&s;|fied with the <HI>blue ribbon,</HI> it is the nature of man never to be content|ed with any thing, nor &s;ecure of what he has unle&s;s he be perpetu|ally adding. And as this order would &s;till be apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;|ing the exclu&s;ive honour and influence they had, they would eter|nally be caballing and working for more, to the di&s;quiet of the go|vernment.
<PB N="9" REF="017863_0009_0FA373BC45DC59D8">And admitting the pre&s;ent members would not abu&s;e it; is any one certain, that their children will make no ill u&s;e of it? The officers can tran&s;mit to their po&s;terity, their fortunes, their reputation, and the peerage of Cincinnati: but can they leave to them, as a legacy, that virtue which lately led them to encoun|ter the hard&s;hips of a perilous war? Or when the pre&s;ent genera|tion is off the &s;tage, will the &s;ons of our &s;elf-created patricians, who will not experience the adver&s;ity their fathers bore in defending their liberties; will they, finding them&s;elves rai&s;ed above their neighbours, agree to de&s;cend, and live on a footing of equality with them? Or will they not rather, relying on the rank and power of an ari&s;tocratic nobility, di&s;daining private men, nor &s;tanding in fear of public laws engro&s;s the offices, powers and influence of the republic, which &s;hould belong to the body of the people? Or in ca&s;e any ambitions leader, or a few, &s;hould threaten the liberties of the commons&punc; or Congre&s;s on a future day, inve&s;ted with a re|venue, a fleet and army, attempt a point of con&s;equence: will they not &s;upport the one or the other, as it will be mo&s;t likely to &s;up|port their order? In &s;uch a di&s;pute their weight would turn the &s;cale; for the number of the peers of the order, reckoning honora|ry members (which their good policy would lead them to choo&s;e out of the fir&s;t rate men) cannot be far &s;hort of ten thou&s;and; and as they will be the principal men in America, to &s;uppo&s;e that each can, by his influence, procure two or three followers, who will ad|here to his intere&s;t and &s;ervice, is a rea&s;onable calculation. Here is a body of 20 or 30,000 men immediately; and every generation will be adding to the number.</P>
<P>Had our officers le&s;s merit and claim to the applau&s;e of their countrymen at home, and to &s;ame abroad, I &s;hould not be &s;o a|larmed at this bold u&s;urpation of theirs. For a cla&s;s of men of lit|tle worth, could never have influence to render an in&s;titution of this nature detrimental to the freedom of their country. It would rather meet with ridicule, and dwindle into nothing. But it mu&s;t be remembered, that a &s;eries of hardy&punc; gallant, &s;plendid actions, through a fierce and de&s;perate conflict; their toils and &s;ufferings: and their patience under them; and above all, the glorious &s;ucce&s;s which crowned the whole&punc; have rendered the officers of the Ame|rican army, the mo&s;t renowned band of men, that this day walk on the face of the globe. And was it as well acquainted as I am, with the temper of goodne&s;s and humanity which runs thro' the whole of them, they would be as much beloved as they are admir|ed. Their bravery the world knows: But as it is not foreign to my &s;ubject, I &s;hall give an example of their good &s;en&s;e and philan|thropy, on a very eminent occa&s;ion. It will be a con&s;iderable aid to me, while I try to give an idea of their general character.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern army was encamped near Jack&s;onborough, and covered our a&s;&s;embly in 1782, while it was driving down the con|fi&s;cation bu&s;ine&s;s; which has made &s;o much noi&s;e, and out of which daily multiply &s;o many unfore&s;een mi&s;chiefs. And it may be wor|thy of remarking, that from the commander down to the rugged, ragged centinel, the army in general held that act in dete&s;tation. The officers mixed with the members of both hou&s;es during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure with cool, gentleman-like rea&s;on|ing; which I believe was one cau&s;e, that the li&s;t of the pro&s;cribed was no larger than it is. They could not account how the citi|zens of South Carolina, who&s;e &s;ufferings la&s;ted only about 16 or 18 months, and mo&s;t of whom had from the beginning of the trou|bles been &s;peculating and making money, could be urged on by

<P>My ob&s;ervations here go to prove, that the order of Cincinnati, compo&s;ed of our Major Generals, Brigadiers, and field officers, re|inforced and firmly &s;upported by all the potent families and leading fir&s;t-r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te men, in and out of the different legi&s;latures and public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> throughout America, who&s;e influence and intere&s;t the deep po|licy of the Order has already determined to pre-engage as honorary members; that this body, I &s;ay, in con&s;equence of their meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;er|vices, and lu&s;tre of character, forms a very broad and re&s;pectable foundation for rai&s;ing a hereditary nobility in America; and are much more likely to produce it, than were the heads and fir&s;t found|ers of ancient or modern nobility in the old world.</P>
<P>Let us go up to the &s;ource of nobility among the Romans, and &s;ee whether it will bear a compari&s;on with the Cincinnati, the fountain of American pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&punc; In the fir&s;t age of that republic, they had no idea of in&s;tituting &s;uch an order. We have only to imagine a &s;ociety of men, living in a &s;tate of &s;implicity, with fortunes on a level, each po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing no more than two acres of ground. A few old men were cho&s;en for the legi&s;lature di&s;tingui&s;hed for nothing but the experience of years, and an affection they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have for the people&punc; hence they were called <HI>patres</HI> or <HI>fathers.</HI> But the de&s;cendents of the&s;e plain home&s;pun families, in a few years by con&s;idering them|&s;elves as di&s;tinct from their fellow citizens a&s;&s;uming preten&s;ions; forming family unions; and cementing them by intermarriages: This policy alone, without title or badge of honor, laid in Rome the foundation of a nobility, with &s;uch pride and thir&s;t of domineering, that even <HI>after monarchy was aboli&s;hed,</HI> by the depo&s;ition of the <HI>Tarquin family,</HI> the people, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was brought about, gained but little by the bargain.

That of the Bath, from another idle flory. The order of St. An|drew, very dignified formerly, from a dream of a &s;uper&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tious prince of Scotland. That of St. Patrick, lately in&s;tituted among the Iri&s;h, (who, though it is only a link in the chain which ties them down, are, it &s;eems, very fond of it,) from a legendary tale of a fanatic preacher: who, if he ever exi&s;ted at all, had not half the learning or merit of Whitefield or We&s;ley. At lea&s;t nobody will in&s;i&s;t that the men or circum&s;tances which gave ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ence to tho&s;e orders, were &s;o likely to produce an <HI>bereditary di&s;tinction,</HI> as the American Revolution and the Cincinnati, the fame of who&s;e exploits re&s;ounds through the world.</P>
<P>If we trace nobility up to the head in Venice and other parts of Europe, we &s;hall find it in every nation &s;mall and contemptible but that the very creating a <HI>public di&s;tinct order,</HI> uniformly terminated in every country, in &s;ervitude to the people.

<P>But although the force of tho&s;e remarks is well known to men of &s;en&s;e of the army, yet they cannot be contented with the reputation which their &s;ervices have &s;ecured to them, unle&s;s they appropriate an hereditary peerage. <HI>Except their pay,</HI> I cannot &s;ee any thing they want to &s;atisfy them, unle&s;s that their eclat being &s;o univer&s;al, po|pularity has, like a mi&s;tre&s;s after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t her charms in their eyes; they con&s;ider her too common, and &s;eek &s;ome other beauty out of the ordinary way.

<P>The government of this country, as formed by the con&s;titution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a democracy. If this was the ca&s;e, which I &s;hall not di&s;pute, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rally ran into an ari&s;tocracy.

<P>To apply the force of this remark here, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in the Jack&s;on borough proceedings, our fir&s;t-rate men were the leaders and drivers, till the bu&s;ine&s;s was gone through. For the others with hearts fully bent on it, had not heads to contrive a mi&s;chief of &s;uch magnitude. But after it was over, the gentry be|low, di&s;covered more inclination to undo what was pa&s;t, and were touched more with compa&s;&s;ion than the other, for the mi&s;eries they had created. I believe this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more owing to the effects of education, which humani&s;es the mind, than to policy, in the ways of which they are not as yet &s;ufficiently hackneyed, however the thing it&s;elf has gained them con&s;iderable weight, while the demo|cracy is &s;unk in ruin. For the generality begin to look up to the few, as alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the prudence and policy of a civilized peo|ple, and alone worthy of holding the reins of the republic; while the democratic part of our A&s;&s;embly are eyed, as unfeeling and incon&s;iderate, and making no &s;cruple to abu&s;e their power; even to the trampling on the laws and rights of their fellow citizens, for the glorious-exploit of hunting down a Tory. In &s;hort, the public opinion and power of the government, is on the &s;ide of the ari&s;tocracy; at the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pirit of the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thoroughly broken. In other countries governments, like the hu|man body, have had their growth, perfection and decay: but ours, like an untimely birth, &s;uffered an abortion before it was in ma|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rity fit to come into the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks may appear trivial to &s;ome of my readers: but they are worthy, in my opinion, the attention of the philo&s;opher and hi&s;torian. They &s;erve to &s;hew, that the freedom of a country may be overturned by cau&s;es imperceptible to the multitude: and that when popular a&s;&s;emblies are carried away by violent pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;trike at per&s;ons in&s;tead of things, they are then clo&s;ely work|ing for the aggrandi&s;ement of others; and while they avenge par|ty injuries on petty enemies, only lay a &s;nare for that liberty which &s;hould be held mo&s;t dear to them and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>To bear &s;ome thoughtle&s;s people boa&s;t of our democracy, when it does not exi&s;t, is plea&s;ant: for our government, I have &s;hewn, is an ari&s;trocracy; and will be in a few years as fierce and oppre&s;|&s;ive as that of Poland or Venice, if the Order of Cincinnati be &s;uf|fered to take root and &s;pread in it, for it will compleat what the Jack&s;onborough policy has left undone.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems no one who took protection will be admitted to the honour of the Order. Is not this a&s;&s;erting a &s;uperiority, at once ruinous to the equality of a republic? If the peers of the Order already draw &s;uch a line of &s;eparation, I would not wi&s;h to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|nuate to what lengths their children will carry the di&s;tinction a|gain&s;t the po&s;terity of protection-men.</NOTE> The&s;e fre&s;h &s;lips of no|bility will &s;pring up, over&s;hade and prevent the growth and flour|i&s;hing
<PB N="14" REF="017863_0014_0FA373C005CF4E00">of our youth; and &s;oon cover under one dark &s;hade of vile in&s;ignificance and &s;ub&s;erviency, the de&s;cendants of the middle and lower order of the virtuous few, and protection-men: and after peri&s;hing every fair plant throughout the &s;tate, they will &s;hoot forth branches wide-&s;preading on every &s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and finally yield &s;uch bitter fruit, as will work a fatal poi&s;on to the little political health and happine&s;s there is left us.</P>
<P>I have proved I hope to the reader's &s;atisfaction, that the Cin|cinnati creates two di&s;tinct orders among&s;t us. 1&s;t. A race of here|ditary Nobles; founded on the military, together with the pow|erful families, and fir&s;t rate, leading men in the &s;tate, who&s;e view it will ever be, <HI>to rule:</HI> and 2d. The people or plebeians, who&s;e only view is not to be oppre&s;&s;ed: but who&s;e certain fate it will be to &s;uffer oppre&s;&s;ion under the in&s;titution: I have &s;hewed that it is a deep laid contrivance to beget, and perpetuate family grandeur in an ari&s;tocratic Nobility, to terminate at la&s;t in monarchical tyranny. And I &s;hall now pa&s;s on to point out the con&s;titutional means of oppo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>I feel &s;en&s;ibly that the few remarks I have to make, are too bold and deci&s;ive to meet the approbation of &s;ome men. But if there be among my readers one, who merits the name of a republican, I have the confidence to believe his opinion will go along with mine.</P>
<P>To cru&s;h this Order, then, without embroi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the &s;tate, there is but one way. Let the legi&s;lature immediately enter into &s;pirited re&s;olutions again&s;t it: let them tell the Order, and the world, that however pious or patriotic the pretence, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any political combina|tion of military commanders, is, in a republican government, ex|tremely hazardous, and highly cen&s;urable. But that in&s;tituting ex|clu&s;ive honours and privileges of an Hereditary Order, is a daring u&s;urpation on the &s;overeignty of the republic: a dangerous in&s;ult to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rights and liberties of the people, and a fatal &s;tab to that prin|ciple of equality, which forms the ba&s;is of our government; to e&s;ta|bli&s;h which the people fought and bled as well as the Cincinnati; though the latter are now taking every mea&s;ure to rob them of the credit, and of the fruits of it. If this would not do, and the Order &s;till go on; yet &s;uch a re&s;olve would have a good effect. It would, like Ithuriel's &s;pear in Milton, touch the Order; and however plau|&s;ible the external appearance, under which it now &s;its transformed, the re&s;olution would oblige it, as the fallen angel in paradi&s;e, to &s;tart up in its own true hideous &s;hape and likene&s;s; and then we &s;hould know how to grapple with it. And afterwards, though I am will|ing to con&s;ider our officers as the plank, which bore us through the &s;torm &s;afe to land, yet I am one that would not let it be the means of drowning us in a calm, within the harbour. The examples of the wi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and mo&s;t renowned republics of which hi&s;tory furni&s;hes any account, and the opinion of the able&s;t political writers, will &s;upport me in a doctrine, which I &s;hould di&s;cu&s;s on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, if I were certain that our citizens, for who&s;e information I am writing, were good &s;tuff for republicans.</P>
<P>With regard to my&s;elf, I will be candid to own, that although I am morally certain the in&s;titution will entail upon us the evils I have mentioned: yet I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea, that it will come to a di&s;&s;olution. The fir&s;t cla&s;s, or leading gentry in the &s;tate, and who will always hold the government, will find their intere&s;t in &s;upporting a di&s;tinction that will gratify their ambition, by re|moving them far above their fellow citizens. The middling order of our gentry, and &s;ub&s;tantial land holders, may &s;ee its tendency, but they can take no &s;tep to oppo&s;e it; having little to do with the
<PB N="15" REF="017863_0015_0FA373C0C8DAA5B8">government. And the lower cla&s;s, with the city populace, will ne|ver rea&s;on on it, till they feel the &s;mart, and then they will have neither the power nor capacity for a reformation. Be&s;ides, the &s;o|ciety will have more adherents from another quarter than they are aware of. The &s;eeds of internal divi&s;ion, and a variety of humours are thick &s;own in this country. The legi&s;lature bearing hard on many families, and individuals: public and private partiality and inju&s;tice: malecontents bia&s;&s;ed in favour of monarchy: all this will rai&s;e a party, who out of hatred to the government of the people, will range them&s;elves under the banners of any man of faction, to promote its intere&s;t, and be avenged.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I know too well, to entertain the vain hope of any individual &s;ucceeding in oppo&s;ition. But although I fore&s;ee the con|&s;equences, yet I think it a point of duty to give this public te&s;timo|ny of my di&s;like to the Order. I tru&s;t its members will pardon me, if I &s;hall ever hold it ignominious, that tho&s;e gallant citizens, who with as much valour and per&s;everance, though not with the &s;ame ecla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as the cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nental officers, &s;tepped forth and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;ub|duing the Lion, &s;hould &s;ubmit to be degraded by creatures of their own rank and condition.</P>

<P>SINCE the foregoing publication w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th the pre&s;s, a &s;et of "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Bye Laws of the Society of Cincinnati e&s;tabli&s;hed in South-Carolina," have been printed and handed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bout in this city. I have peru&s;ed their rules and I am more convinced than ever, that the in&s;ti|tution is one of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> extraordinary factions, which the &s;tory of republics furni&s;hes any account of; that my notion of it, my argu|ment on the &s;ubject, and my apprehen&s;ions concerning its con&s;e|quences, are well founded. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the fir&s;t role, and conclude with a few remarks. It runs thus:</P>
<P>"The State Society accedes to the propo&s;itions and rules tran&s;|mitted to Maj. Gen Moultrie, by Maj&punc; Gen. Heath and Steuben, re|&s;pectively, on the 20th May and&mdash;day of June la&s;t with this re&s;er|vation, that if the &s;aid propo&s;itions or rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;hould by any con&s;tructi|on be held obligatory on the &s;ociety, to interfere in any &s;hape what|&s;oever, with the civil polity, of this or any of the United States, or the United States in general, this &s;ociety will not deem them&s;elves bound thereby: They prizing too highly the civil liberties of their country, and their own rights as citizens, to con&s;ent that a mili|tary &s;ociety, &s;hould in any &s;en&s;e dictate to civil authority&punc;"</P>
<P>Here is a candid fair acknowledgment, that no &s;mall danger was to be apprehended to lurk under the in&s;titution of a military &s;ociety. They di&s;claim, it is true, all &s;ini&s;ter views in them&s;elves, and &s;o may the Grand Order, although they let the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out of the bag too &s;oon, make us the &s;ame fine promi&s;es in &s;ome future re&s;olution. Their prizing too highly the liberties of their country, and their own rights as citizens, is all the &s;ecurity we have again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But I would a&s;k men of knowledge among them, if there be one example in the world of an ambitious man or powerful faction, who
<PB N="16" REF="017863_0016_0FA373C188E16830">to bring about their de&s;igns, did not pretend to be public bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ac|tors; warm advocates for the public; and wonderfully careful of the civil liberties of their country? Is not this the &s;ure&s;t way of undermining? When Cromwell and his Major Generals, tho&s;e &s;courges of monarchy, and champions for popular government, when they were executing their fine &s;chemes, did they tell the world they intended to u&s;urp the &s;overeignty, though this was their de|&s;ign? Or did not they amu&s;e even their own party, with preaching and canting about religion and liberty? Were their u&s;urpations the le&s;s &s;o, becau&s;e they fought well, &s;erved their country, and made fair promi&s;es?</P>
<P>The &s;econd rule of the State Order, tells us, <Q>the principal end of the Society, is to maintain their indigent officers and their wi|dows, and to maintain and educate their indigent children.</Q> For my own part, I entertain not an idea of &s;uch degeneracy in the &s;tate, as to &s;uppo&s;e it will not make a decent provi&s;ion for them. But for the purpo&s;e of a charitable u&s;e, to entail a nobility on the Cincin|nati, which will entail bondage on the people, is charity with a witne&s;s! It is like that &s;ort of benevolence that would introduce the plague, in order to get rid of a quartan ague.</P>
