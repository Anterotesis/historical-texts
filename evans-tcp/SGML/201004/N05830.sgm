<P>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men, for our People, and for the Cities of our God: And the Lord do that which &s;eemeth him good.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AN Hundred Years of Peace and Liberty in &s;uch a World as this, is a very unu&s;ual Thing; and yet our Country has been the happy Spot that has been di&s;|tingui&s;hed with &s;uch a long Series of Ble&s;&s;ings, with little or no Interruption. Our Situation in the Mid|dle of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, and our Separation from the <HI>French,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>eternal</HI> Enemies of Liberty and <HI>Britons,</HI> on the one Side by the va&s;t <HI>Atlantic,</HI> and on the other by a long Ridge of Mountains, and a wide, extended Wilderne&s;s, have for many Years been a Barrier to us; and while other Nations have been involved in War, we have not been alarmed with the Sound of the Trumpet, nor &s;een <HI>Garments rolled in Blood.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Scene is changed: Now we begin to experience in our Turn the Fate of the Nations of the Earth. Our Territories are invaded by the Power and Perfidy of <HI>France;</HI> our Frontiers ravaged by mercile&s;s Savages, and our Fellow-Subjects there murdered with all the horrid Arts of <HI>Indian</HI> and Popi&s;h Torture.
<PB N="4" REF="007403_0003_102D819E8EFAA3F8">Our General <HI>unfortunately brave,</HI> is fallen, an Army of 1300 choice Men routed, our fine Train of Artillery taken, and all this (Oh mortifying Thought!) all this by 4 or 500 da&s;tardly, in&s;idious, Barbarians.</P>
<P>The&s;e Calamities have not come upon us without Warnings. We were long ago apprized of the ambitious Schemes of our Ene|mies, and their Motions to carry them into Execution: And had we taken timely Mea&s;ures, they might have been cru&s;hed, before they could arrive at &s;uch a formidable Height. But how have we gene|rally behaved in &s;uch a critical Time; Alas! our Country has been &s;unk in a deep Sleep: A &s;tupid Security has unmanned the Inhabitants: They could not realize a Danger at the Di&s;tance of 2 or 300 Miles: They would not be per&s;uaded, that even <HI>French Papi&s;ts</HI> could &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ign us an Injury: And hence little or nothing has been done for the Defence of our Country in Time, except by the Compul&s;ion of Authority. And now, when the Cloud thickens over our Heads, and alarms every thoughtful Mind with its near Approach, Multitudes, I am afraid, are &s;till di&s;&s;olved in carele&s;s Security, or enervated with an effeminate, cowardly Spirit. When the melancholy News fir&s;t reached us concerning the Fate of our Army, then we &s;aw how natural it is for the Pre&s;umptuous to fall into the oppo&s;ite Extreme of unmanly De&s;pondence and Con&s;ternation; and how little Men could do in &s;uch a Pannic for their own Defence. We have al&s;o <HI>&s;uffered our poor Fellow-Subjects in the Frontier Counties to fall a helple&s;s Prey to Blood-thir&s;ty Savages, without affording them proper A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,</HI> which as Members of the &s;ame Body Politic, they had a Right to expect. They might as well have continued <HI>in a State of Nature,</HI> as be united <HI>in Society,</HI> if in &s;uch an Article of extreme Danger, they are left to &s;hift for them&s;elves. The bloody Barba|rians have exerci&s;ed on &s;ome of them the mo&s;t unnatural and lei|&s;urely Tortures; and others they have butchered in their Beds, or in &s;ome unguarded Hour. Can human Nature bear the Horror of the Sight! See yonder! the hairy Scalps, clotted with Gore! the mangled Limbs! the ript-up Women! the Heart and Bowels, &s;till palpitating with Life, &s;moking on the Ground! See the Sava|ges
<PB N="5" REF="007403_0004_102D81A0DE3C1108">&s;willing their Blood, and imbibing a more outragious Fury with the inhuman Draught! Sure the&s;e are not <HI>Men;</HI> they are not <HI>Bea&s;ts of Prey;</HI> they are &s;omething wor&s;e; they mu&s;t be <HI>infernal Furies</HI> in human Shape. And have we tamely looked on, and &s;uf|fered them to exerci&s;e the&s;e helli&s;h Barbarities upon our Fellow-Men, our Fellow-Subjects, our Brethren? Alas! with what Hor|ror mu&s;t we look upon our&s;elves, as being little better than Acce&s;|&s;aries to their Blood?</P>
<P>And &s;hall the&s;e Ravages go on unchecked? Shall <HI>Virginia</HI> incur the Guilt and the everla&s;ting Shame, of tamely exchanging her Liber|ty, her Religion, and her All, for arbitrary <HI>Gallic</HI> Power, and for Popi&s;h Slavery, Tyranny and Ma&s;&s;acre? Alas! are there none of her Children, that enjoyed all the Ble&s;&s;ings of her Peace, that will e&s;pou&s;e her Cau&s;e, and befriend her now in the Time of her Danger? Are <HI>Britons</HI> utterly degenerated by &s;o &s;hort a Remove from their Mother-Country? Is the Spirit of Patrioti&s;m entirely extingui&s;hed among us? And mu&s;t I give thee up for lo&s;t, O my Country, and all that is included in that important Word? Mu&s;t I look upon thee as a conquered, en&s;laved Province of <HI>France,</HI> and the Range of <HI>Indian</HI> Savages? My Heart breaks at the Thought. And mu&s;t ye, our unhappy Brethren in our Frontiers, mu&s;t ye &s;tand the &s;ingle Barriers of a ravaged Country, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, unbe|friended, unpitied? Alas! mu&s;t I draw the&s;e &s;hocking Conclu&s;i|ons?</P>
<P>No; I am agreeably checked by the happy, encouraging Pro&s;|pect now before me. Is it a plea&s;ing Dream? Or do I really &s;ee a Number of brave Men, without the Compul&s;ion of Authority, without the Pro&s;pect of Gain, voluntarily a&s;&s;ociated in a Compa|ny, to march over horrendous Rocks and Mountains, into an hi|deous Wilderne&s;s, to &s;uccour their helple&s;s Fellow-Subjects, and guard their Country? Yes, Gentlemen, I &s;ee you here upon this De&s;ign; and were you all united to my Heart by the mo&s;t endear|ing Ties of Nature, or Friend&s;hip, I could not wi&s;h to &s;ee you engaged in a nobler Cau&s;e; and whatever the Fondne&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion might carry me to, I am &s;ure my Judgment would never &s;uffer me to per&s;uade you to de&s;ert it. You all generou&s;ly put your Lives in
<PB N="6" REF="007403_0005_102D81A30287CFD8">your Hands; and &s;undry of you have nobly di&s;engaged your&s;elves from the &s;trong and tender Ties that twine about the Heart of <HI>a Fa|ther,</HI> or <HI>a Husband,</HI> to confine you at home in inglorious Ea&s;e, and &s;neaking Retirement from Danger, when your Country calls for your A&s;&s;i&s;tance. While I have you before me, I have high Thoughts of a <HI>Virginian;</HI> and I entertain the plea&s;ing Hope that my Country will yet emerge out of her Di&s;tre&s;s, and flouri&s;h with her u&s;ual Ble&s;&s;ings. I am gratefully &s;en&s;ible of the unmerited Honour you have done me, in making Choice of me to addre&s;s you upon &s;o &s;ingular and important an Occa&s;ion: And I am &s;ure I bring with me a Heart ardent to &s;erve you and my Country, though I am af|fraid my Inability, and the Hurry of my Preparations, may give you Rea&s;on to repent your Choice. I cannot begin my Addre&s;s to you with more proper Words than tho&s;e of a great General, which I have read to you: <HI>Be of good Courage, and play the Men, for your People, and for the Cities of your God; and the Lord do what &s;eem|eth him good.</HI></P>
<P>My pre&s;ent De&s;ign is, to illu&s;trate and improve the &s;undry Parts of my Text, as They lie in order, which you will find rich in &s;undry important In&s;tructions, adapted to this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Words were &s;poken ju&s;t before a very threat'ning Engagement by <HI>Joab,</HI> who had long &s;erved under that pious Hero King <HI>David,</HI> as the General of his Forces, and bad &s;hewn him&s;elf an Officer of true Courage, conducted with Prudence. The <HI>Ammonites,</HI> a neighbouring Nation, at frequent Ho&s;tilities with the <HI>Jews,</HI> had ungratefully offered Indignities to &s;ome of <HI>David's</HI> Courtiers whom he had &s;ent to condole their King upon the Death of his Father, and congratulate his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown. Our holy Religion teaches us to bear <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Injuries without <HI>private</HI> Revenge: But <HI>national</HI> In&s;ults and Indignities ought to excite the <HI>public</HI> Re&s;entment. Accordingly King <HI>David,</HI> when he heard that the <HI>Ammoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> with their Allies, were preparing to invade his Territories, and carry their Injuries &s;till farther, &s;ent <HI>Joab</HI> his General, with his Army, to repel them and avenge the Affronts they had offered his Subjects. It &s;eems the Army of the Enemy were much more nu|merous than <HI>David</HI>'s: Their Mercenaries from other Nations were
<PB N="7" REF="007403_0006_102D81A491BAD950">no le&s;s than 31,000 Men; and no Doubt the <HI>Ammonites</HI> them&s;elves were a &s;till greater Number. The&s;e numerous Forces were di&s;po&s;ed in the mo&s;t advantagious Manner, and &s;urrounded <HI>Joab</HI>'s Men, that they might attack them both in Flank and Front at once, and cut them all off, leaving no Way for them to e&s;cape. Prudence is of the utmo&s;t Importance in the Conduct of an Army: And <HI>Joab,</HI> in this critical Situation, gives a Proof how much he was Ma&s;ter of it, and di&s;covers the &s;teady Compo&s;ure of his Mind, while thus &s;ur|rounded with Danger. He divides his Army, and gives one Party to his Brother <HI>Abi&s;hai,</HI> who commanded next to him, and the other he kept the Command of him&s;elf, and re&s;olves to attack the <HI>Syrian</HI> Mercenaries, who &s;eemed the mo&s;t formidable; he gives Orders to his Brother in the mean Time to Fall upon the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> and he animates him with this noble Advice: <HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People and the Cities of our God,</HI> which are now at Stake: <HI>And the Lord do what &s;eemeth him Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men:</HI>&mdash;Courage is an e&s;&s;en|tial Character of a good Soldier:&mdash;Not a &s;avage ferocious Vio|lence:&mdash;Not a fool-hardy In&s;en&s;ibility of Danger, or head&s;trong Ra&s;hne&s;s to ru&s;h into it:&mdash;Not the Fury of enflamed Pa&s;&s;ions, broke loo&s;e from the Government of Rea&s;on: But calm, delibe|rate, rational Courage; a &s;teady, judicious, thoughtful Fortitude; the Courage of a Man, and not of a Tyger: Such a Temper as <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> a&s;cribes with &s;o much Ju&s;tice to the famous <HI>Malborough</HI> and <HI>Eugene:</HI>
<Q><L>Who&s;e Courage dwelt not in a troubled Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;&mdash;But</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul, with Virtue over-rul'd,</L>
<L>Inflam'd by Rea&s;on, and by Rea&s;on cool'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Campaign.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is true Courage, and &s;uch as we ought all to cheri&s;h in the pre&s;ent dangerous Conjuncture. This will render Men vigilant and cautious again&s;t Surprizes, prudent and deliberate in concerting their Mea&s;ures, and &s;teady and re&s;olute in executing them. But
<PB N="8" REF="007403_0007_102D81A6E3738408">without this they will fall into un&s;u&s;pected Dangers, which will &s;trike them with wild Con&s;ternation: They will meanly &s;hun Dan|gers that are &s;urmountable, or precipitantly ru&s;h into tho&s;e that are cau&s;ele&s;s, or evidently fatal, and throw away their Lives in vain.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Men who <HI>naturally</HI> have this heroic Turn of Mind. The wi&s;e Creator has adapted the natural Genius of Man|kind, with a &s;urprizing and beautiful Variety to the State in which they are placed in this World. To &s;ome he has given a Turn for intellectual Improvement, and the liberal Arts and Sciences; to others a Genius for Trade; to others a Dexterity in Mechanics, and the ruder Arts, nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of human Life: The Generality of Mankind may be capable of tolerable Improvements in any of the&s;e: But it is only they whom the God of Nature has formed for them, that will &s;hine in them, every Man in his own Province. And as God well knew what a World of degenerate, ambitious, and revengeful Creatures this is; as he knew that In|nocence could not be protected, Property and Liberty &s;ecured, nor the Lives of Mankind pre&s;erved from the lawle&s;s Hands of Ambition, Avarice and Tyranny, without the U&s;e of the Sword; as he knew this would be the only Method to pre&s;erve Mankind from univer&s;al Slavery; he has formed &s;ome Men for this dread|ful Work, and fired them with a martial Spirit, and a glorious Love of Danger. Such a Spirit, though mo&s;t pernicious when ungoverned by the Rules of Ju&s;tice, and Benevolence to Mankind, is a public Ble&s;&s;ing, when rightly directed: Such a Spirit, under God, has often mortified the In&s;olence of Tyrants, checked the Incroachments of arbitrary Power, and delivered en&s;laved and ru|ined Nations: It is as nece&s;&s;ary in its Place, for our Sub&s;i&s;tence in &s;uch a World as this, as any of the gentler Genius's among Mankind; and it is derived from the &s;ame divine Original. He that winged the Imagination of an <HI>Homer</HI> or a <HI>Milton,</HI> he that gave Penetration to the Mind of <HI>Newton,</HI> he that made <HI>Tubal-Cain</HI> an In&s;tructor of Artificers in Bra&s;s and Iton <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> iv. 22.</NOTE>, and gave Skill to <HI>Be|zaleel</HI> and <HI>Aholiab</HI> in curious Works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxxv. 30, 31, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>; nay, he that &s;ent out <HI>Paul</HI> and his Brethren to conquer the Nations with the gentler Wea|pons
<PB N="9" REF="007403_0008_102D81A8AF29AF48">of <HI>Plain Truth,</HI> Miracles, and the Love of a crucified Savi|our; HE, even that &s;ame gracious Power, has formed and rai&s;ed up an <HI>Alexander,</HI> a <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> a <HI>William</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King <HI>William</HI> the Third, the Deliverer of <HI>Britain</HI> from Popery and Slavery, and the Scourge of <HI>France</HI> and her haughty <HI>Grand Monarque.</HI></NOTE>, and a <HI>Malborough,</HI> and in&s;pired them with this enterprizing, intrepid Spirit, the Two fir&s;t to &s;courge a guilty World, and the Two la&s;t to &s;ave Nations on the Brink of Ruin. There is &s;omething <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>inviting</HI> in Danger, to &s;uch noble Minds; and their Brea&s;ts beat with a gene|rous Ardour when it appears.</P>
<P>Our Continent is like to become the Seat of War; and we, for the future (till the &s;undry <HI>European</HI> Nations that have planted Colo|nies in it, have fixed their Boundaries by the Sword) have no other Way left to defend our Rights and Privileges. And has God been plea&s;ed to diffu&s;e &s;ome Sparks of this Martial Fire through our Country? I hope he has: And though it has been almo&s;t ex|tingui&s;hed by &s;o long a Peace, and a Deluge of Luxury and Plea|&s;ure, now I hope it begins to kindle: And may I not produce you my Brethren, who are engaged in this Expedition, as In&s;tances of it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As a remarkable In&s;tance of this, I may point out to the Public that heroic. Youth Col. <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto pre|&s;erved in &s;o &s;ignal a Manner, for &s;ome important Service to his Country.</NOTE>? Well, cheri&s;h it as a &s;acred Heaven-born Fire; and let the Injuries done to your Country admini&s;ter Fewel to it; and kindle it in tho&s;e Brea&s;ts where it has been hitherto &s;mothered.</P>
<P>Though Nature be the true Origin of military Courage, and it can never be kindled to a high Degree, where there is but a feeble Spark of it innate; yet there are &s;undry Things that may improve it even in Minds full of natural Bravery, and animate tho&s;e who are naturally of an effeminate Spirit to behave with a tolerable Degree of Re&s;olution and Fortitude, in the Defence of their Country. &mdash;I need not tell you that it is of great Importance for this End that you &s;hould be at Peace with God and your own Con&s;cience, and prepared for your future State. Guilt is naturally timerous, and often &s;truck into a Panic even with imaginary Dangers; and an infidel Courage, proceeding from Want of Thought, or a &s;tupid
<PB N="10" REF="007403_0009_102D81ACF36E2B10">Carele&s;ne&s;s about our Welfare through an immortal Duration be|yond the Grave, is very unbecoming a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a Chri&s;tian. The mo&s;t important Periods of our Exi&s;tence, my Brethren, lie Beyond the Grave; and it is a Matter of much more Concern to us, what will be our Doom in the World to come, than what becomes of us in this. We are obliged to defend our Country; and that is a &s;neaking, &s;ordid Soul indeed that can de&s;ert it at &s;uch a Time as this: But this is not all; we are al&s;o obliged to take Care of an immortal Soul; a Soul that mu&s;t exi&s;t, and be happy or mi&s;erable, through the Revolutions of eternal Ages. This &s;hould be our fir&s;t Care: and when this is &s;ecured, Death, in its mo&s;t Shocking Forms, is but a Relea&s;e from a World of Sin a Sorrows, and an Introduction into everla&s;ting Life and Glory. But how can this be &s;ecured? not by a Cour&s;e of impenitent Sinning; not by a Cour&s;e of &s;tupid Carele&s;ne&s;s and Inaction: But by vigorous and re&s;o|lute &s;triving; by &s;erious and affectionate Thoughtfulne&s;s about our Condition, and by a con&s;cientious and earne&s;t Attendance upon the Means that God has graciou&s;ly appointed for our Recovery. But <Q>we are Sinners, heinous Sinners again&s;t a God of infinite Purity and inexorable Ju&s;tice. Yes, we are &s;o; and does not the Po&s;ture of Penitents then become us? Is not Repentance, deep, broken-hearted Repentance,</Q> a Duty &s;uitable to Per&s;ons of our Character? Undoubtedly it is: And therefore, O my Country|men, and particularly you brave Men that are the Occa&s;ion of this Meeting, REPENT: Down upon your Knees before the provoked Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, again&s;t whom you have rebelled. Di&s;&s;olve and melt in penitential Sorrows at his Feet; and he will tell you <HI>Ari&s;e, be of good Chear; your Sins are forgiven you.</HI> <Q>But will Repentance make Atonement for our Sins? Will our Tears wa&s;h away their Guilt? Will our Sorrows merit Forgive|ne&s;s?</Q> No, my Brethren, after you have done all, you are but unprofitable Servants: After all your Sorrows, and Prayers and Tears, you de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed as obnoxious Criminals: That would be a &s;orry Government indeed, where Repentance, per|haps extorted by the &s;ervile Fear of Puni&s;hment, would make A|tonement for every Offence. But <HI>I bring you glad Tidings of great

This I earne&s;tly recommend to all my Hearers, and e&s;pecially to you Gentlemen, and others, that are not about generou&s;ly to ri&s;que your Lives for your Country. Account this the be&s;t Preparative to encounter Danger and Death; the be&s;t Incentive to true, rational Courage. What can do you a la&s;ting Injury, while you have a reconciled God &s;miling upon you from on high, a peaceful Con&s;cience animating you within, and a happy Immortality ju&s;t before you! Sure you may bid De|fiance to Dangers and Death in their mo&s;t &s;hocking Forms. You have an&s;wered the End of this Life already by preparing for ano|ther; and how can you depart off this mortal Stage more honour|ably, than in the Cau&s;e of Liberty, of Religion, and your Coun|try? But if any of you are perplexed with gloomy Fears about
<PB N="12" REF="007403_0011_102D81B1006522A0">this important Affair, or con&s;cious you are entirely unprepared for Eternity, what mu&s;t you do? Mu&s;t you &s;eek to prolong your Life, and your Time for Preparation, by mean or unlawful Ways, by a cowardly De&s;ertion of the Cau&s;e of your Country, and &s;hifting for your little Selves, as though you had no Connection with So|ciety? Alas! this would but aggravate your Guilt, and render your Condition &s;till more perplexed and di&s;couraging. FOLLOW THE PATH OF DUTY wherever it leads you, for it will be always the &s;afe&s;t in the I&s;&s;ue. Diligently improve the Time you have to <HI>make your Calling and Election &s;ure,</HI> and you have Rea&s;on to hope for Mercy, and <HI>Grace to help in</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Time of Need.</HI>&mdash;You will forgive me, if I have enlarged upon this Point, even to a Digre&s;|&s;ion; for I thought it of great Con&s;equence to you all. I &s;hall now proceed with more Ha&s;te.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o of great Importance to excite and keep up our Courage in &s;uch an Expedition, that we &s;hould be full &s;atisfied we engage in a <HI>righteous</HI> Cau&s;e,&mdash;and in a Cau&s;e of <HI>great Moment;</HI> for we can|not pro&s;ecute a &s;u&s;pected or a wicked Scheme, which our own Minds condemn, but with He&s;itation and timorous Apprehen&s;ions; and we cannot engage with Spirit and Re&s;olution in a trifling Scheme, from which we can expect no Con&s;equences worth our vigorous Pur&s;uit. This <HI>Joab</HI> might have in View in his heroic Advice to his Brother; <HI>Be of good Courage,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and let us play the Men, for our People, and for the Cities of our God.</HI> q. d. <HI>We are engaged in a</HI> righteous <HI>Cau&s;e; we are not urged on by an unbounded Lu&s;t of Power or Riches, to encroach upon the Rights and Properties of others, and di&s;turb our quiet Neighbours: We act entirely upon the defen&s;ive, repel unju&s;t Violence, and avenge national Injuries; we are fighting</HI> for our People, and for the Cities of our God. <HI>We are al&s;o engaged in a Cau&s;e of the utmo&s;t</HI> Importance. <HI>We fight for</HI> our People; <HI>and what Endearments are included in that &s;ignificant Word! Our Liberty, our E&s;|tates, our Lives! our King, our Fellow-Subjects, our venerable Fathers, our tender Children, the Wives of our Bo&s;om, our Friends, the Sharers of our Souls, our Po&s;terity to the late&s;t Ages! And who would not u&s;e his Sword with an exerted Arm, when the&s;e lie at State? But even the&s;e are not all: We fight</HI> for the Cities of our God. <HI>God has di&s;tingui&s;hed us
<PB N="13" REF="007403_0012_102D81B28F537640">with a Religion from Heaven; and hitherto we have enjoyed the quiet and unre&s;trained Exerci&s;e of it: He has conde&s;cended to become a</HI> gentilitial God <HI>to our Nation; and honor'd our Cities with his gracious Pre&s;ence, and the In&s;titutions of his Wor&s;hip, the Means of making us wi&s;e, good and happy: But now the&s;e mo&s;t invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings lie at Stake; the&s;e are the Prize for which we contend; and mu&s;t it not excite all our active Powers to the highe&s;t Pitch of Exertion? Shall we tamely &s;ubmit to Idolatry and religious Tyranny? No, God forbid:</HI> Let us play the Men, <HI>&s;ince we take up Arms for our People, and the Cities of our God.</HI></P>
<P>I need not tell you how applicable this Advice, thus paraphra&s;ed, is to the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociated Company. The Equity of our Cau&s;e is mo&s;t evident. The <HI>Indian</HI> Savages have certainly no Right to murder our Fellow-&s;ubjects, living quiet and inoffen|&s;ive in their Habitations; nor have the <HI>French</HI> any Power to hound them out upon us, nor to invade the Territories belonging to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, and &s;ecured to it by the Faith of Treaties. This is a clear Ca&s;e. And it is equally clear, that you are engaged in a Cau&s;e of the utmo&s;t Importance. To protect your Brethren from the mo&s;t bloody Barbarities&mdash;to defend the Territories of the be&s;t of Kings again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Tyranny of arbitrary Power, to &s;e|cure the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty, <HI>Briti&s;h Liberty,</HI> from the Chains of <HI>French</HI> Slavery&mdash;to pre&s;erve your E&s;tates, for which you have &s;weat and toiled, from falling a Prey to greedy Vultures, <HI>Indians,</HI> Prie&s;ts, Friers, and hungry <HI>Gallic</HI> Slaves, or not-more-de|vouring Flames&mdash;to guard your Religion, the pure <HI>Religion of Je&s;us,</HI> &s;treaming uncorrupted from the &s;acred Fountain of the Scriptures; the mo&s;t excellent, rational and divine Religion that ever was made known to the Sons of Men; to guard &s;uch a dear precious Religion (my Heart grows warm while I mention it) again&s;t Ig|norance, Super&s;tition, Idolatry, Tyranny over Con&s;cience, Ma&s;|&s;acre, Fire and Sword, and all the Mi&s;chiefs, beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, with which Popery is pregnant&mdash;to keep from the cruel Hands of Barbarians and Papi&s;ts, your Wives, your Children, your Parents, your Friends&mdash;to &s;ecure the Liberties conveyed to you by your brave Fore-Fathers, and bought with their Blood, that you may tran&s;mit them uncurtailed to your Po&s;terity&mdash;the&s;e are the Ble&s;&s;ings

I count my&s;elf happy that I &s;ee &s;o many of yo engaged in &s;uch a Cau&s;e; but when I view it in this Light, I cannot but be concerned that there are &s;o few to join you. Are there but 50 or 60 Per&s;ons in this large and populous County that can be &s;pared from home for a few Weeks upon &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a De&s;ign, or that are able to bear the Fatigues of it? Where are the Friends of human Nature, where the Lovers of Liberty and Reli|gion? Now is the Time for you to come forth, and &s;hew your|&s;elves.

Ari&s;e, and march away; you had better be ab&s;ent from tho&s;e you love for a little while, than &s;ee them butchered before your Eyes, or doomed to eternal Poverty and Slavery. The A&s;&s;ociation now &s;orming is not yet compleat; and if it were, it would be a glorious Thing to form another. Therefore, as an Advocate for your King, your Fellow-Subjects, your Country, Your Relatives, Your earthly All, I do invite and intreat all of you, who have not &s;ome very &s;ufficient Rea&s;on again&s;t it, voluntarily to enli&s;t, and go out with tho&s;e brave Souls, who
<PB N="15" REF="007403_0014_102D81B72FF71D20">have &s;et you &s;o noble an Example. It will be more advantageous to go out in Time, and more honourable to go out as Volunteers, than to be compelled to it by Authority, when perhaps it may be too late.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of the Ju&s;tice and Importance of the Cau&s;e may al&s;o encourage You to hope, that the Lord of Ho&s;ts will e&s;|pou&s;e it, and render its Guardians &s;ucce&s;sful, and return them in Safety to the Arms of their longing Friends. The Event howe|ver is in his Hands; and it is much better there, than if it were in Yours. This Thought is &s;ugge&s;ted with beautiful Simplicity, in the remaining Part of my Text. <HI>The Lord do that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI> This may be looked upon in various Views, as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It may be under&s;tood as the Language of Uncertainty and Mode&s;ty. <HI>q. d. Let us do all we can; but after all, the I&s;&s;ue is un|certain; we know not, as yet, to what Side God will incline the Victory.</HI> Such Language as this, my Brethren becomes us in all our Under|takings; it &s;ounds <HI>Creature-like,</HI> and God approves of &s;uch &s;elf-dif|fident Humility. But to indulge &s;anguine and confident Expecta|tions of Victory, to <HI>boa&s;t</HI> when we <HI>put on our Armour,</HI> as though we were <HI>putting it off,</HI> and to derive our high Hopes from our own Power and good Management, without any Regard to the Provi|dence of God, this is too lordly and a&s;&s;uming for &s;uch feeble Mor|tals; &s;uch In&s;olence is generally mortified, and &s;uch a haughty Spirit, is the Fore-runner of a Fall. Therefore, though I do not apprehend Your Lives will be in any great Danger in Your pre&s;ent Expedition to range the Frontiers, and clear them of the &s;kulking <HI>Indians;</HI> yet, I would not flatter You, my Brethren, with too high Hopes either of Victory or Safety. I cannot but entertain the plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect of congratulating You will may of Your Friends, upon Your &s;ucce&s;sful Expedition, and &s;afe Return: And yet it is very po&s;&s;ible our next Interview may be in that &s;trange untried World beyond the Grave. You are, however, in the Hands of God, and he will deal with you as it <HI>&s;eemeth him good:</HI> And I am per&s;uaded You would not wi&s;h it were otherwi&s;e; You would not now practically retract the Petition You have &s;o often offered up, <HI>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="16" REF="007403_0015_102D81B90239A808">
2. This Language; <HI>The Lord do as &s;eemeth him good,</HI> may be looked upon as expre&s;&s;ive of a firm Per&s;ua&s;ion that the Event of War entire|ly depends upon the Providence of God. <HI>q. d.</HI> Let <HI>us</HI> do our be&s;t; but after all, let us be &s;en&s;ible that the Succe&s;s does not de|pend on <HI>us; that</HI> is entirely in the Hands of an <HI>all-ruling God.</HI> That God governs the World, is a fundamental Article of natural, as well as revealed Religion: It is no great Exploit of Faith, to be|lieve this: It is but a &s;mall Advance beyond Athei&s;m, and down|right Infidelity. I know no Country upon Earth, where I &s;hould be put to the Expence of Argument to prove this. The Heathens gave &s;triking Proofs of their Belief of it, by their Prayers, their Sacrifices, their con&s;ulting Oracles, before they engaged in War; and by their co&s;tly Offerings and &s;olemn Thank&s;givings, after Victory. And &s;hall &s;uch a plain Principle as this, be di&s;puted in a Chri&s;tian Land? No; we all &s;peculatively believe it; but that is not enough; let our Spirits be deeply <HI>impre&s;&s;ed</HI> with it, and our Lives <HI>influenced</HI> by it; Let us live in the World, as in a Territory of Jehovah's Empire. Carry this Impre&s;&s;ion upon Your Hearts into the Wilderne&s;s, whither You are going. Often let &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e recur to your Minds, <HI>I am the feeble Creature of God; and ble&s;&s;ed be his Name, I am not ca&s;t off his Hand as a di&s;regarded Orphan to &s;hift for my&s;elf. My Life is under his Care; the Succe&s;s of this Expedi|tion is at his Di&s;po&s;als Therefore, O thou all-ruling God, I implore thy Protection; I confide in this Care; I chearfully re&s;ign my&s;elf, and the E|vent of this Undertaking, to thee.</HI> Which leads me to ob&s;erve,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the&s;e Words, <HI>The Lord do what &s;eemeth him good,</HI> may ex|pre&s;s a humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the Di&s;po&s;al of Providence, let the E|vent turn out as it would. <HI>q. d. We have not the Di&s;po&s;al of the E|vent, not do we know what will be: But Jehovah knows, and that is enough. We are &s;ure he will do what is be&s;t, upon the whole; and it becomes us to acquie&s;ce!</HI> Thus, my Friends, do You re&s;ign and &s;ubmit your|&s;elves to the Rules of the World in the pre&s;ent Enterprize. He <HI>will</HI> order Matters as he plea&s;es; Oh! let him do &s;o by Your chear|ful Con&s;ent. Let Succe&s;s of Di&s;appointment, let Life or Death be the I&s;&s;ue, &s;till &s;ay, <HI>Good is the Will of the Lord; let him do what &s;eem|eth him good:</HI> Or if Nature bia&s;&s;es Your Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires to the

<ITEM>4. The&s;e Words, in their Connection, may intimate, that let the Event be what it will, it will afford us Satisfaction to think, that we have done the be&s;t we could. <HI>q d. We cannot command Suc|ce&s;s; but let us do all in our Power to obtain it, and we have Rea&s;on to hope that in this Way we &s;hall not be di&s;appointed: But if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to render all our Endeavours vain, &s;till we &s;hall have the generous Plea&s;ure to reflects, that we have not been acce&s;&s;ary to the Ruin of our Country, but have done all we could for its Deliverance.</HI> So You my Brethren have generou&s;ly engaged in a di&s;intere&s;ted Scheme for Your King and Country: God does generally crown &s;uch noble Undertakings with Succe&s;s, and You have Encouragement to hope for it: But the Cau&s;e You have e&s;pou&s;ed, is the Cau&s;e of a &s;inful impenitent Country; and if God, in righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;hould on this Account bla&s;t your Attempt, &s;till you will have the Plea&s;ure of reflecting upon Your generous Views and vigorous Endeavours, and that You have done Your Part con&s;cientiou&s;ly.</ITEM>

It concerns you all &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon your own Sins, and the Sins of your Land, which have brought all the&s;e Calamities upon us. If You believe that God governs the World, if You do not abjure him from being the Ruler of Your Country, You mu&s;t acknowledge that all the Calamities of War, and the threatening Appearances of Famine, are ordered by his Providence; <HI>There is no Evil in a City or Country, but the Lord hath done it.</HI> And if You believe that he is a ju&s;t and Righteous Ruler, You mu&s;t al&s;o be|lieve, that he would not thus puni&s;h a righteous or a penitent Peo|ple. We and our Countrymen are Sinners, aggravated Sinners: God proclaims that we are &s;uch by his Judgments now upon us, by withering Fields and &s;canty Harve&s;ts, by the Sound of the Trumpet and the Alarm of War. Our Con&s;ciences mu&s;t al&s;o bear witne&s;s to the &s;ame melancholy Truth. And if my Heart were properly affected, I would concur with the&s;e undoubted Witne&s;|&s;es: I would cry aloud, and not &s;pare, I would lift up my Voice like a Trumpet, to &s;hew You Your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and Your Sins.

God will appear for us, and give a pro&s;perous Turn to our Affairs; he has a&s;&s;ured us of this in his own Word, <HI>At what In&s;tant,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it; if that Nation, again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them,</HI> Jer. xviii. 7, 8. Therefore, my Bre|thren, as we have all rebelled, let us all join in unanimous Repen|tance, and a through Reformation. Not only your eternal Sal|vation requires it, but al&s;o the Pre&s;ervation of your Country, that is now bleeding with the Wounds you have given it by your Sins. The Safety of the&s;e our Friends, who are now engaged in &s;o ge|nerous a De&s;ign, requires it: For an Army of Saints or of Heroes, cannot defend a guilty, impenitent People, ripe for the Judgments of God. If you would be everla&s;tingly happy, and e&s;cape the Vengeance of eternal Fire, or (to mention what may perhaps have more Weight with &s;ome of you) if you would pre&s;erve your|&s;elves, your Families, you Po&s;terity, from Poverty, from Slavery, Ignorance Idolatry, Torture and Death; if you would &s;ave your&s;elves and them from all the infernal Horrors of Popery, and the &s;avage Tyranny of a mongrel Race of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Con|querors; in &s;hort, if you would avoid all that is terrible, and en|joy every Thing that is dear and valuable, REPENT, and turn to the Lord. This is the only Cure for our wounded Coun|try; and if you refu&s;e to admini&s;ter it in Time, prepare to peri&s;h in its Ruins. If you go on impenitent in Sin, you may expect not only to be damned for ever, but (what is more terrible to &s;ome of you) to fall into the mo&s;t extreme outward Di&s;tre&s;s. You will have
<PB N="23" REF="007403_0022_102D81C6F1AFECC8">Rea&s;on to fear not only the Lo&s;s of Heaven, which &s;ome of you per|haps think little of, but the Lo&s;s of your E&s;tates, that lie &s;o near your Hearts. And will you not repent, when you are pre&s;&s;ed to it from &s;o many Quarters at once?</P>
<P>And now, My Brethren, in the la&s;t Place, I have a &s;ew parting Words to offer to you who are more particularly concerned in this Occa&s;ion; and I am &s;ure I &s;hall addre&s;s you with as much affecti|onate Benevolence as you could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t and leading Advice to you is, Labour to conduct this Expedition in a Religious Manner. Methinks this &s;hould not &s;eem &s;trange Coun&s;el to Creatures, entirely dependent upon God, and at his Di&s;po&s;al. As you are an Independent Company of Volunteers under Officers of your own chu&s;ing, you may manage your Affairs more according to your own Inclinations, than if you had enli&s;ted upon the ordinary Footing: And I hope you will improve this Advantage for the Purpo&s;es of Religion. Let Prayer to the God of your Life be your daily Exerci&s;e. When Retirement is &s;afe, pour out your Hearts to him in &s;ecret; and when it is practicable, join in Prayer together Morning and Evening in your Camp. How acceptable to Heaven mu&s;t &s;uch an <HI>unu&s;ual Offering be,</HI> from that de&s;art Wilderne&s;s! Maintain a Sen&s;e of divine Providence upon your Hearts, and re&s;ign your &s;elves and all your Affairs into the Hands of God. You are engaged in a good Cau&s;e, the Cau&s;e of your People, and the Cities of your God; and therefore you may the more boldly commit it to him, and pray and hope for his Ble&s;&s;ing. I would fain hope, there is no Nece&s;&s;ity to take Precautions a|gain&s;t Vice among &s;uch a &s;elect Company: But le&s;t there &s;hould, I would humbly recommend to you to make this one of the Ar|ticles of your A&s;&s;ociation, before you &s;et out, that every Form of Vice &s;hall be &s;everely di&s;countenanced, and if you think proper, ex|po&s;e the Offender to &s;ome pecuniary or corporal Puni&s;hment. It would be &s;hocking indeed, and I cannot bear the Tho't, that a Com|pany formed upon &s;uch generous Principles, &s;hould commit or to|lerate
<PB N="24" REF="007403_0023_102D81C90A7A6B38">open Wickedne&s;s among them; and I hope this Caution is needle&s;s to you all, as I am &s;ure it is to &s;undry of you.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Friends, and the Friends of you neglected Country, <HI>In the Name of the Lord lift up your Banners: Be of good Courage, and play the Men for the People and the Cities of your God; and the Lord do what &s;eemeth him god.</HI> Should I now give Vent to the Pa&s;&s;ions of my Heart, and become a Speaker for my Country, methinks I &s;hould even overwhelm you with a Torrent of good Wi&s;hes, and Prayers from the Hearts of Thou&s;ands. May the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> go forth along with you! <HI>May he teach your Hands to War, and gird you with Strength to Battle!</HI> May he ble&s;s you with a &s;a&s;e Return, and long Life, or a glorious Death in the Bed of Honour, and a happy Im|mortality! May he guard and &s;upport your anxious Families and Friends at home, and return you victorious to their longing Arms! May all the Ble&s;&s;ings your Hearts can wi&s;h attend you wherever you go! The&s;e are the Wi&s;hes and Prayers of my Heart; and Thou&s;ands concur in them: And we cannot but cheerfully hope they will be granted, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
