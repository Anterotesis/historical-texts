<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;ituation of your dome&s;tic con|cerns, and the fituation of public affairs in general, loudly call for your attention: It is time that you &s;hould know what comforts you are to enjoy, what rights you have to defend.</P>
<P>The laws of nature are &s;ufficiently promulgated by that nece&s;&s;ity which has occa&s;ioned them, by the benefit man receives in ob&s;erving them, and the evils he &s;uffers by their infraction. Governments are in&s;tituted to &s;up|port the laws of nature, and not by the arbitrary de|crees of men to violate them. The&s;e truths, although &s;o obvious and &s;imple, that no per&s;on can be ignorant of them, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be premi&s;|ed in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the principles upon which men enter into civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t acquaintance with the order of &s;ciences evidences that it is by the mo&s;t &s;imple truths that men attain the knowledge of tho&s;e which are le&s;s evident. Thus in geometry, it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin by learning that the whole is greater than any of its parts, that things which are equal to the &s;ame are equal to one an|other, and other truths which children know, but the u&s;e of which is nece&s;&s;ary for penetrating into other truths which are not &s;o clear.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="023507_0003_0FBFCC52DA5AF6A8">
To di&s;cover the origin of government it is not nece&s;|&s;ary that we &s;hould have recour&s;e to the vague opinions of the &s;cholia&s;ts, or to the contradictory accounts of civilians: A careful inve&s;tigation into the nature of man, manife&s;ts that it is the intention of the Creator of the world that he &s;hould live in &s;ociety. His &s;en&s;ations, his faculties, his wants in childhood and in old age, render this &s;tate nece&s;&s;ary. Man thus united in &s;ociety, is not left to the arbitrary and capricious decrees of men; but, with every other part of the creation, has laws ordained by GOD for his government: the&s;e laws are &s;imple and evident; they have their foundation in the reciprocal duties men owe to each other, and their rights ari&s;ing from &s;uch duties.</P>
<P>On whatever &s;ide we turn our eyes, we &s;ee nothing in nature which is not governed by laws proper to its exi&s;tence, and which is not organi&s;ed in a manner to obey &s;uch laws, to acquire every &s;uccour which is a|greeable to the nature of its being, or nece&s;&s;ary to its mode of exi&s;tence, Man is not neglected by his Crea|tor; the gifts which to him are particular, and which give him the empire of the world, manife&s;t that hap|pine&s;s and pro&s;perity are de&s;igned for him, and an or|der proper to en&s;ure him the enjoyment of them.&mdash; Therefore, we mu&s;t regard &s;ociety as being the work of GOD him&s;elf, and the laws con&s;tituting the &s;ocial order as making part of the univer&s;al and immutable laws of the creation. In &s;upport of this opinion, man is found in every part of the world connected with his fellow creatures upon principles of government more or le&s;s perfect, according to the &s;ituation of the coun|try, and the number of its inhabitants, where the na|tural produce of the earth affords a &s;ufficient &s;upport for its few inhabitants, and the gratification of their
<PB N="5" REF="023507_0004_0FBFCC5455CD7778">wants does not depend on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men, but ari&s;es from the bountiful gifts of GOD; the &s;ocial tie is the weake&s;t imaginable. Men depending on wild animals taken in cha&s;e, or on &s;i&s;h for their &s;upport, having a right in the game they take, as the ju&s;t reward of their exertions and indu&s;try, and al&s;o in their bows and arrows, and other per&s;onal property, they are &s;tronger united in &s;ociety than the la&s;t; but even in this &s;tate, the &s;ociety as a body does not revenge the injuries which any individual may &s;u&s;tain, as every man is &s;uppo&s;ed capable of defending his per&s;on and the &s;mall property immediately connected with it.</P>
<P>In the pa&s;toral life, the mark of government is &s;till &s;tronger; here you have ma&s;ter and &s;ervant and &s;ome degree of &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>But whenever the population of a country becomes &s;o great as to render the cultivation of the &s;oil nece&s;&s;a|ry for the &s;upport of its inhabitants, then a &s;irm, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed government becomes equally nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port each individual citizen in the right of &s;oil, and the advantages and pro&s;its ari&s;ing from his labor.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering Agriculture then, as forming the ba&s;is of regular government; it is proper that every citizen engaged in this mo&s;t honorable, and mo&s;t u&s;eful em|ploy, &s;hould be acquainted with that chain of practical truths, which con&s;titutes the order of laws the mo&s;t advantageous to men united in &s;ociety: The&s;e are com|pri&s;ed under regulations or ordinances, mo&s;t favorable to the cultivation of the land, in which the intere&s;t of all is concerned, and to which the increa&s;e of every good is united.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="023507_0005_0FBFCC5936599300">
Convinced of the dependence of civil &s;ociety upon Agriculture, and that the population, the pro&s;perity and the happine&s;s of a country is in a direct ratio to the cultivation of the earth; it becomes the intere&s;t, it becomes the duty of the farmers of the United States, to procure a &s;y&s;tem of laws favorable to this di|vine &s;cience. Under this happy &s;ituation of public affairs the rights and duties of men would be known: ju&s;tice and the energy of government, would be firmly united together for the protection of the liberty of every citizen; and your property, after having once contri|buted to the &s;upport of government by an equal direct tax, would become perfectly free, without being &s;ub|ject to unju&s;t commercial regulations.</P>
<P>The independent yeomanry of England are almo&s;t annihilated, owing to a de&s;tructive lethargy having taken place among&s;t them re&s;pecting their rights &mdash; The gentlemen in that country, living independent on their own e&s;tates, have always been duped, by men much more active and connected than them&s;elves, into the belief that to grant the demands of the commercial and ma|nufacturing cla&s;&s;es, was the be&s;t way of promoting their own intere&s;t&mdash;The farmer, after paying one tenth of the produce of his labor to the clergy, two or three more tenths to the government, and a very heavy tax for the &s;upport of a numerous poor, rendered &s;o by large ma|nufacturing towns: after this weight of taxes, the free &s;ale of the remainder of his produce is re&s;tricted to &s;a|tisfy the avarice of merchants and manufacturers.</P>
<P>A freeman &s;hould examine every act of government for him&s;elf; for, however di&s;intere&s;ted, however vir|tuous the men intru&s;ted with the legi&s;lative authority; yet if they are ignorant of the dependence of civil &s;o|ciety
<PB N="7" REF="023507_0006_0FBFCC5CF12901B8">upon the phy&s;ical order of cultivation, their ad|mini&s;tration will produce nothing but arbitrary, mutable, and contradictory laws&mdash;State&s;men and lawyers have greatly contributed to involve the rights of men as con|nected in civil &s;ociety into a labyrinth of error, invert|ing the order of nature, and, in the place of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing government upon the &s;imple principles of ju&s;tice, u&s;ing every artifice to render the &s;cience of politics im|penetrable to the people, wi&s;hing to attract the admira|tion of an ignorant populace by my&s;terious, and ob|&s;cure oracles, rather than enlighten the minds of free citizens by &s;ub&s;tantial and immutable truths.</P>
<P>Nor is it any matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that Lawyers &s;hould be ignorant of the fundamental principles of government: All the &s;ciences have been rendered ob|&s;cure by the pretended teachers of them. The hi&s;tory of medicine, and of philo&s;ophy in general, &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion. Even the Chri&s;tian religion it&s;elf is &s;o greatly altered from its original purity and &s;implicity, that was the holy founder of it now to appear on earth, he would &s;carcely be acknowledged by the o&s;tentatious profe&s;&s;ors of his own doctrines. Mankind in general continue in error, becau&s;e the guides on whom they depend, being them&s;elves unacquainted with truth, are incapable of in&s;tructing others, and therefore only in|culcate &s;uch fal&s;e principles as they are infe&s;ted with. Knowledge mu&s;t be acquired by experience and reflec|tion, by which means alone we are enabled to di&s;tin|gui&s;h &s;ub&s;tantial, permanent good, from tran&s;itory plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;cience of political economy in no in&s;tance is &s;ubject to uncertainty, but a plea&s;ing uniformity is di&s;|coverable in every part of it. To engage the learned
<PB N="8" REF="023507_0007_0FBFCC606B373F68">in the belief of a new &s;cience may be difficult, and &s;till more difficult to render them &s;o humble as to &s;tudy its elements. Wi&s;dom frequently in&s;pires us with a con|fidence in the knowledge acquired, and makes us &s;u&s;|picious of novelties. Men, who have dedicated great part of their lives to antient and modern learning, will not ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded that the antients were ignorant of the e&s;&s;ential truths of political economy; and that the moderns, who have acquired &s;o much u&s;eful know|ledge in philo&s;ophy, &s;hould be unacquainted with the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of promoting the happine&s;s of men united in &s;ociety. Yet this is really the ca&s;e, and the world is alone indebted to a few enlightened men in France for this important di&s;covery.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject merits your mo&s;t &s;erious attention, hav|ing no le&s;s an object in view than e&s;tabli&s;hing a govern|ment founded in ju&s;tice. The &s;ublime &s;atisfaction which you will experience in being the authors of pub|lic good, and of &s;eeing thou&s;ands of your fellow citi|zens happy in living under your admini&s;tration, will be your ample reward.</P>
<P>It is to you alone that the people of the United States can look&mdash;it is to you alone that they ought to look, for protection and &s;upport. Men of weak judge|ments and little reflection, regard the Farmers merely as laborers, who rai&s;e wheat or other grain for the &s;u&s;|tenance of men; but they appear ignorant that it is the Farmers alone who furni&s;h every other cla&s;s of citizens with the means of paving their expences, and on who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s depends the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of a perfect knowledge with political economy, and the high &s;tation which you hold in civil
<PB N="9" REF="023507_0008_0FBFCC61F0DA12B0">&s;ociety, &s;hould engage you to dedicate part of your lei&s;ure to the &s;tudy of this &s;cience&mdash;a &s;cience evidently of the fir&s;t importance, becau&s;e it brings us near to GOD him&s;elf, by engaging us to promote the general pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of mankind. Removed from the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of a great city, and accu&s;tomed to reflection, you are well qualified to become acquainted with truth, by means of &s;trict examination.</P>
<P>Being your&s;elves convinced of the exi&s;tence of a na|tural order, intended by the Creator of the Univer&s;e for the purpo&s;e of promoting the happine&s;s of men united in &s;ociety: For you to be &s;ilent or inactive on this important &s;ubject, would be criminal. Although you may not at pre&s;ent have &s;ufficient influence to di&s;|&s;ipate the thick clouds of political ignorance, with which our country is &s;urrounded, or to &s;top the unju&s;t mea&s;ures of government; yet you may expect to &s;ee that day, when your fellow-citizens in general will be convinced of the ju&s;tice of the&s;e &s;alutary principles; and admitting their in&s;luence over every department of government, we &s;hall experience a happy revolution in our laws, and in our manners, by which means our country will become the &s;eat of ju&s;tice and of peace. Experience, reflection and truth, mu&s;t open the eyes of men, and will dictate tho&s;e mea&s;ures mo&s;t proper for them to adopt. For whenever public affairs are directed by mere opinion, they are always fluctuating, inadequate and unju&s;t. Tyrants, governed by opinion, believe that their happine&s;s and reputation con&s;i&s;t in de&s;tructive wars, in parade, and in expence; and your Legi&s;lators, governed by mere opinion, think it nece&s;|&s;ary that the commerce of your country &s;hould be re|&s;tricted by oppre&s;&s;ive and embarra&s;&s;ing regulations, e|qually unju&s;t and impolitic. When a people are inat|tentive
<PB N="10" REF="023507_0009_0FBFCC63588D3B88">to the fundamental principles of their original compact, or to the conduct of tho&s;e men intru&s;ted with the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate, they mu&s;t expect that the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the community will be continually &s;acrificed to the ambition and avarice of a few.</P>
<P>There are no people more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their govern|ment than the Chine&s;e, becau&s;e they are well in&s;tructed in the reciprocal duties of the &s;overeign, and of the people, and are watchful that the&s;e duties are not vi|olated on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>You have hitherto been equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to your government, but you have not been equally attentive to the conduct of your officers entru&s;ted with the ad|mini&s;tration of it; and yet there are men among you who are anxious for a more efficient government, in order to render the people &s;till more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.&mdash;Such characters &s;hould reflect, that a time may come when rea&s;on will find the minds of our citizens di&s;po&s;ed to hear, and will determine them to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice. A wi&s;e Legi&s;lature will di&s;tingui&s;h between the appro|bation of their con&s;tituents, and the indignant &s;ilence or lethargy of a free people.</P>

<P>THE particular terms made u&s;e of in the inve&s;|tigation of any &s;cience, &s;hould have clear and deter|mined ideas affixed to them. By <HI>political economy</HI> is to be under&s;tood, that natural order appointed by the Creator of the Univer&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of promoting the happine&s;s of men in united &s;ociety. This &s;cience is &s;upported by the phy&s;ical order of cultivation, cal|culated to render the &s;oil the mo&s;t productive po&s;&s;ible; and by the &s;acred moral principle of doing unto others as we would have others to do unto us&mdash;The fir&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary to the maintenance and exi&s;tence of civil &s;o|ciety &mdash;the la&s;t, equally nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure its pro&s;|perity.</P>
<P>In the propagation of this ble&s;&s;ed doctrine, you mu&s;t expect to be oppo&s;ed by the ignorant, proud, and all tho&s;e indolent characters among you who are anxious for lucrative offices in government, that they may be &s;upported by the labor of their fellow-citizens. You will be told by the&s;e wretched di&s;ciples of Machiavel, Hobbs and Spino&s;a, that the natural &s;tate of man is that of a &s;avage animal, perpetually at war with his fel|low-creatures; that it is force alone which renders him &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to government; and that &s;elf-intere&s;t con|&s;tantly engages him to take the advantage of his neigh|bors by force or &s;tratagem&mdash;A mo&s;t horrid &s;y&s;tem, which authori&s;es every &s;pecies of outrage and inju&s;tice, and from the adoption of which it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that every man in civil &s;ociety mu&s;t be either ma&s;ter or &s;lave, oppre&s;&s;or or oppre&s;&s;ed; and to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from de&s;truction, mu&s;t be con&s;tantly employed in the ruin of others. The error of the&s;e men ari&s;es from their want of reflection, and con&s;equently mi&s;tak|ing a momentary intere&s;t for a &s;olid, permanent good, dictated by rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023507_0011_0FBFCC6C82AA8A78">
The &s;ame Great Being who created man for the pur|po&s;es of his own glory, has al&s;o appointed an order of conduct, calculated to conciliate the intere&s;ts of men united in &s;ociety, not merely by a&s;&s;uring to each indi|vidual his own &s;afety, without u&s;urping the rights of others, but by making the proportion of every man's happine&s;s to depend upon his benevolence and &s;ervices to others.</P>
<P>Men, thus united in &s;ociety, and forming a di&s;tinct government, mu&s;t naturally wi&s;h that &s;uch government &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s great riches, great authority, and great power. The only po&s;&s;ible means of acquiring this &s;itu|ation, depends upon a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the phy&s;ical order of cultivation&mdash;When the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate, con&s;idering it&s;elf as a partner entitled to receive only a ju&s;t portion of the net proceeds of the land, &s;e|cures and protects the Farmer in the free di&s;po&s;al of the remainder.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign power which thinks it has the right of commanding, and wi&s;hes to enjoy the power of making it&s;elf obeyed, &s;hould at the &s;ame time comply with its duty in doing nothing but for the general good of the &s;ociety, and &s;ecuring to every individual the full enjoyment of tho&s;e natural rights, to &s;ecure which men enter into civil &s;ociety, and put them&s;elves under the protection of government,</P>
<P>The reciprocal rights and duties of the people, and of the &s;overeign, con&s;titutes &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice. In con|&s;idering this &s;ubject one point &s;hould be attended to, which is, that in every government the duty of the &s;overeign power, in acting con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the people, always preceeds its right of demanding
<PB N="13" REF="023507_0012_0FBFCC6FF1E014E8">obedience; whil&s;t, on the contrary, between individu|als, every man's duty of &s;erving his fellow-citizens, precedes his right of expecting any benefit or attention from them. The ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e funda|mental laws mu&s;t appear evident to every per&s;on in the lea&s;t acquainted with the &s;ituation of men in &s;ociety; they naturally ari&s;e from that &s;ituation, and owe no|thing to legi&s;lative authority, or expre&s;s contract.</P>
<P>An ignorance or neglect of the&s;e &s;alutary principles of political economy, mu&s;t occa&s;ion the whole admi|ni&s;tration of that exten&s;ive government which you have adopted, to be wavering and unju&s;t; and your repre|&s;entatives being too far removed from the in&s;tructions of their con&s;tituents, will think that their own ha&s;ty o|pinion or caprice &s;hould be the ruling principle of legi&s;|lation. But the yeomanry of the United States will certainly never &s;uffer them&s;elves to be reduced to that abject &s;tate of &s;ervility as to believe that thou&s;ands of freemen &s;hould be &s;ubject to the arbitrary opinion of the few; or that the people owe every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government, whil&s;t that government is only devoted to &s;upport the luxury or ambition of its officers.</P>
<P>A Legi&s;lature unprovided with any fixed rule of conduct in the exerci&s;e of its power, mu&s;t con&s;tantly be &s;ubject to the caprice of the moment. You &s;hould therefore impre&s;s the minds of your &s;ervants in Con|gre&s;s with the ju&s;t principles of political economy&mdash;an attention to which will guard them again&s;t the infatua|tion of power, the projects of ambition, or any fal&s;e ideas of glory, connected with the extravagance and parade of a court. This duty is more particularly ne|ce&s;&s;ary at a time when your country is ju&s;t at the com|mencement of a new and important aera, and when too
<PB N="14" REF="023507_0013_0FBFCC725C876010">many of your fellow-citizens, infatuated with the fal&s;e principles of the government of Great-Britain, are anxious to adopt her wretched &s;y&s;tem of policy. To divide the intere&s;t of the people appears to be a funda|mental maxim of that government; and therefore it is con&s;tantly engaged in making laws to regulate its agri|culture, its commerce, and its manufactures; and thus, by &s;acrificing the intere&s;ts of one cla&s;s of citizens to an|other. jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities are created among them. In the place of doing &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice to her indu&s;trious farmers, manufacturers, and mechanics, by admitting a free di&s;po&s;al of the produce of their labor and ingenuity, the country is overwhelmed with com|mercial regulations, in order to &s;ecure a monopoly of the carrying-trade to her own merchants, and to &s;up|port a very expen&s;ive navy; although the real advan|tage of either, have never been clearly a&s;certained.&mdash; From hence al&s;o the exclu&s;ion of &s;trangers from her ports, prohibitory impo&s;itions, repri&s;als, jealou&s;ies of commerce, quarrels, and, in fine, the mo&s;t de&s;tructive wars, to &s;upport mea&s;ures, the contrary of which would be the true intere&s;t of that country.</P>
<P>Every unprejudiced citizen mu&s;t allow, that the total freedom of commerce, without any re&s;trictions what|ever, will be one of the principle means of promoting the pro&s;perity of our country. In this great que&s;tion you &s;hould take a decided part; and as you wi&s;h to &s;upport the general intere&s;t of the community, you &s;hould exert your&s;elves to expo&s;e and &s;uppre&s;s the fal&s;e principles of tho&s;e men who wi&s;h to make their fortunes by monopolies and intrigue; and who&s;e projects of o|pulence are ever founded upon the ruin of the people.</P>

<P>THE Legi&s;lators of a free people, influenced by the ju&s;t principles of political economy, will look only to the land for a &s;ource of revenue. Thus &s;cience mani|e&s;ts the truth of the following axioms, beyond the po&s;|&s;ibility of a doubt.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t: The earth is naturally fruitful.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The earth is not &s;ufficiently productive for the &s;upport of civil &s;ociety without cultivation.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The earth is the only &s;ource of tho&s;e things ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of men.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The earth being the only productive fund, the cultivation of the earth is the only productive employ.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Every other kind of work which has for its object the preparation, alteration, or tran&s;port of &s;uch productions may be more or le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, but they are not productive.</P>
<P N="6">6th. No work can be executed without expence; this expence con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;upport of its agents, and in the collection and pre&s;ervation of the in&s;truments ne|ne&s;&s;ary to &s;uch work.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts then two kinds of work, the one pro|ductive &mdash;the other unproductive. They equally re|quire the expence of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but whil&s;t the one is creative, the other only replaces the actual con&s;umption of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The cultivation of the land being the only produc|tive employ, it con&s;equently does not merely pay the
<PB N="16" REF="023507_0015_0FBFCC7DC3ADAE50">expence of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but al&s;o furni&s;hes a &s;urplus, more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, according to the ability or independent &s;ituation of the Farmer.</P>
<P>It is the intere&s;t of the government, and of every cla&s;s of citizens, that this &s;urplus &s;hould be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it affords the only ju&s;t revenue to the &s;tate:</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, in proportion to the net produce of the land, will be the encouragement and comfortable &s;up|port of u&s;eful mechanics and manufacturers:</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, the greater this produce, the greater will be the employ and profit of the merchant.</P>
<P>In fine, the whole community, from the mo&s;t dig|nified character, to the poore&s;t beggar, are all benefit|ted by the full cultivation of the earth.</P>
<P>As the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of every individual in civil &s;ociety depends upon Agriculture; and as it is the intere&s;t of all, that Agriculture &s;hould be the mo&s;t productive po&s;&s;ible, it is the duty of all to encourage and promote it. This mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed by devot|ing large &s;ums of money to tho&s;e previous expences ne|ce&s;&s;ary to making the land fertile.</P>
<P>The expences which are nece&s;&s;ary to obtain an an|nual production from the land, by cultivation, are of two &s;orts: primitive expences, which con&s;i&s;t in the pur|cha&s;e of in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, hor&s;es, oxen, and other animals nece&s;&s;ary on a well regulated farm; and annual expences, which con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;upport of the Farmer, his family, and &s;tock, from one harve&s;t to the
<PB N="17" REF="023507_0016_0FBFCC7F15C57C80">other: be&s;ides which, 10 per cent. upon the primitive expences &s;hould be annually deducted from the gro&s;s produce of the farm, to replace the &s;tock, in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. which require renovation at lea&s;t every ten years.</P>
<P>The quantity of the net produce of Agriculture de|pends upon the primitive expence; when the fund is inadequate to the full cultivation of the &s;oil; the an|nual expences of every kind being deducted leaves but a &s;mall &s;urplus; and therefore, the greater the fund, the better will be the cultivation, and the greater will be the profit to the farmer, and to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The gro&s;s produce of Agriculture naturally divides it&s;elf into two portions, one of which &s;hould be held &s;acred to di&s;charge every expence nece&s;&s;ary to the full cultivation of the &s;oil; the remainder, forming the great ma&s;s of wealth of the community, is di&s;tributed among the citizens according to their indu&s;try and me|rit. And as this &s;urplus ari&s;ing from Agriculture is the only real wealth of a government, it follows, that a nation cannot &s;pend annually more than its annual income, without de&s;troying it&s;elf. The &s;ub&s;equent works to cultivation do not multiply the riches of a &s;tate, nor extend its power of &s;upporting expence; they are certainly very nece&s;&s;ary, and very u&s;eful, but they are unproductive.</P>
<P>The quantity of the net produce ari&s;ing from culti|vation depends not only upon the quantity of the an|nual produce, but al&s;o on its value; when this is low, a greater proportion of the gro&s;s produce is required to pay the nece&s;&s;ary expences of cultivation, and therefore the &s;urplus remaining mu&s;t be &s;maller. As it is the
<PB N="18" REF="023507_0017_0FBFCC80953F58A8">intere&s;t of every cla&s;s of citizens, and of the govern|ment it&s;elf, that the produce of the land &s;hould be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible, &s;o it is equally the intere&s;t of all, that &s;uch produce &s;hould bear the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible price, by means of a perfect free commerce.</P>
<P>Ambitious State&s;men, and tho&s;e contemptible wretches who are &s;eeking to be &s;upported by the public revenue, will endeavor to per&s;uade you, That by impo&s;ts laid on the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, the burthen of &s;upporting your government will be more equally di|vided among&s;t the citizens&mdash;that &s;uch taxes being op|tional they are mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the independent &s;pirit of freemen&mdash;and that the revenue ari&s;ing from the con&s;umption of the articles taxed, the acquiring of it is attended with le&s;s delay and difficulty than by a di|rect tax.</P>
<P>In&s;tructed in the ju&s;t principles of political economy, you certainly will not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be deceived by &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>As all the private and public wealth of a country a|ri&s;es from the land, the revenue nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;up|port of government can only be derived from the pro|prietors and farmers; therefore, every indirect tax, however circuitous, mu&s;t finally flow from the &s;ame &s;ource. You can gain no po&s;&s;ible advantage from in|direct taxes upon articles of con&s;umption, but on the contrary mu&s;t &s;uffer a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s&mdash;The me|chanic &mdash;the manufacturer&mdash;the merchant, and every other cla&s;s of citizens to whom you may have occa&s;ion to pay wages, will make their charges in proportion to the duties they pay to the government: All &s;uch ex|pences being deducted from the gro&s;s produce of your
<PB N="19" REF="023507_0018_0FBFCC8215180258">farms, mu&s;t dimini&s;h that &s;urplus which con&s;titutes your wealth, <HI>and in proportion to which you &s;hould pay a revenue to the &s;tate for protection.</HI> Such charges may become &s;o great as to eat up the whole produce of your indu&s;try, particularly where the &s;oil is not very rich and fertile. In this &s;ituation you may be regarded as &s;laves to &s;upport the pageantry of government, but cannot be e&s;teemed freemen, acquiring property for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd po&s;ition&mdash;that indirect taxes being optional, they are mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the independent &s;pirit of freemen&mdash;it is a principle that no ju&s;t or wi&s;e government will adopt. The tax which each individual is bound to pay, ought to be certain&mdash; the time and manner of payment, and the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contri|butor. Where it is otherwi&s;e, and it is left to the op|tion of every per&s;on to contribute what &s;um he plea&s;es to the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the &s;tate, di&s;order mu&s;t pervade the mo&s;t important department of government, and the public revenue will be in a &s;ituation of uncer|tainty never to be depended on. Be&s;ides, a free citi|zen of a republic will not wi&s;h to enjoy the protection of a government without contributing his ju&s;t propor|tion towards its &s;upport.</P>
<P>An unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive tax may be acquired from a free people without much difficulty, by laying a duty or exci&s;e upon articles of con&s;umption, in which ca&s;e the purcha&s;er thinks he is only paying the price of the commodity, whil&s;t in fact he is paying a heavy tax. Such a &s;y&s;tem of deception may be well calculated for an ari&s;tocracy, where a few haughty and deluded men are in the habit of violating the rights of their fello-citizens,
<PB N="20" REF="023507_0019_0FBFCC8B9C988A98">and hold them&s;elves unaccountable for the ex|penditure of the public revenue&mdash;But is it &s;afe for a re|public of freemen to be indifferent with re&s;pect to their finances? An enlightened people, wi&s;hing to pre&s;erve the liberty of their country, will cheerfully &s;ubmit to their duty in contributing to the nece&s;&s;ary expences of government, but at the &s;ame time will contend for their rights, in having the revenue &s;trictly appropriated to the ju&s;t demands of the &s;tate, and not wa&s;ted in &s;up|porting the parade or extravagance of the &s;ervants of the people, or in bribery and corruption.</P>
<P>In whatever manner a tax is taken, it is not a mat|ter of indifference to the pro&s;perity of the country. A tax &s;hould take out of the pockets of the citizens as lit|tle as po&s;&s;ible over and above what it brings into the public trea&s;ury of the &s;tate. Indirect taxes upon arti|cles of con&s;umption, in proportion to what they bring into the public trea&s;ury, take from the people more than any other tax, by the number of revenue officers nece&s;&s;ary to carry the &s;y&s;tem into execution, who&s;e &s;a|laries and perqui&s;ites are a real tax upon the people. However plau&s;ible the&s;e taxes may appear, they con|ceal a hidden poi&s;on, which is continually preying up|on the indu&s;trious part of the community. De Witt ob&s;erves, that the Dutch taxes upon con&s;umption, rai&s;ed the price of their broad cloth 40 per cent. Bri|tain has long labored under the &s;ame di&s;temper, which, by excluding her from foreign markets, will put an end to her manufactures. Nothing &s;upports them at pre|&s;ent but the immen&s;e capitals inve&s;ted in them, and the great perfection to which they have brought machinery to aid and facilitate the work. The agriculture and infant manufactures of your country mu&s;t &s;uffer a &s;i|milar fate, if the labor of the poor is to be enhanced by duties on &s;alt and other nece&s;&s;ary articles.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS the earth is the only &s;ource of private and public wealth, it is evident that the revenue &s;hould be determined by the immutable principles of ju&s;tice, being &s;trictly confined to a certain proportion of the produce of the earth, after the deduction of every nece&s;&s;ary ex|pence of the proprietor or farmer. The full cultiva|tion of the &s;oil, and the real intere&s;t of &s;ociety, depends upon this arrangement. It therefore cannot be vio|lated by government with impunity. The laborer, the mechanic, the manufacturer, and every other cla&s;s of citizens, occupied in the &s;ervice of the Farmer, ought not to be &s;ubject to a capitation tax, or to any indirect tax upon the nece&s;&s;aries or conveniences of life. The&s;e occupations, however u&s;eful or agreeable, yet not being productive of any real wealth, every charge and expence to which they are &s;ubject mu&s;t be reimbur&s;ed by the Farmer. If the&s;e principles are not well founded, then civil &s;ociety can exi&s;t independent of the produce of the land, or cultivation, which is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of all nations bears te&s;timony that it is for want of looking to their true intere&s;t that &s;o many governments pur&s;ue an unju&s;t &s;y&s;tem of &s;inance, found|ed upon indirect taxes; being influenced by the caprice of the moment, without any regard to futurity. Such governments not only direct every public mea&s;ure, but al&s;o interfere in the mo&s;t minute actions of their citi|zens: But as &s;uch power is &s;eldom exerci&s;ed con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;trict principles of ju&s;tice, it becomes oppre&s;|&s;ive, con&s;tantly violating the rights, the liberties and pro&s;perity of the people. The ravages of &s;uch govern|ments may be di&s;covered in every quarter of the world: Its direful effects may be traced in the poverty, in the inactivity, and in the depopulated &s;tate of all countries
<PB N="22" REF="023507_0021_0FBFCC8EDBCF79F0">which have experienced its fury. Why at the pre&s;ent day do we find people living in the mo&s;t wretched mi&s;e|ry, although inhabiting countries which by indu&s;try would afford them every convenience to render them happy and comfortable? Why are they deprived of u&s;eful manufactures, or nece&s;&s;ary arts? Is the climate or &s;oil of Egypt, of Greece, of Italy, and many other countries, now langui&s;hing in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, chang|ed? or, mu&s;t we not rather attribute this a&s;toni&s;hing alteration to the de&s;poti&s;m of their governments, which has fru&s;trated the mo&s;t bountiful gifts of nature. Such tyrants, influenced by a puerile pride, attached to their own per&s;ons, and having no idea of real grandeur, connected with the general pro&s;perity of the people, are contented to govern countries almo&s;t depopulated, and which pre&s;ent to the traveller the remains of a former pro&s;perity and population, contra&s;ted with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing appearance of pre&s;ent mi&s;ery and wretched|ne&s;s. The negligence and the extravagance of unju&s;t governments have in this manner changed the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and populous countries into de&s;erts. The land, abandoned by the cultivator, frequently occa&s;ions famines, followed by contagion. All countries be|come healthy in proportion to their cultivation; they are not cultivated but in proportion to their popula|tion; they are not populous but in proportion to the pro&s;perity, the ea&s;e and liberty of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>No government ever derived advantage from keeping its citizens in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery; and yet there are &s;ome politicians who dare to &s;upport the fal&s;e and dete&s;tible opinion, that to render the people &s;ub&s;ervient to go|vernment it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep them poor and depen|dent. Men treated in this way will either fall into a ruinous lethargy and inaction; or, becoming de&s;perate
<PB N="23" REF="023507_0022_0FBFCC908708D7A0">by accumulated wrongs, they will puni&s;h the authors of their mi&s;ery. A government that wi&s;hes to acquire the love and confidence of its citizens, &s;hould be con|&s;tantly engaged in promoting their pro&s;perity and hap|pine&s;s &mdash;This maxim, &s;o &s;imple, and &s;o &s;elf-evident, yet is too little attended to, by men exerci&s;ing the &s;o|vereign power of &s;tates&mdash;On the contrary, unju&s;t and arbitrary rulers expect to be honored, whil&s;t their op|pre&s;&s;ive conduct only in&s;pires horror.

<P>All the&s;e evils ari&s;e from inattention, or from an ignorance of the real intere&s;t of civil &s;ociety, as found|ed upon the full cultivation of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>As you, my fellow-citizens, value the real pro&s;pe|rity of your country, acquaint your&s;elves with the cau&s;es of the decline and fall of nations. The &s;ame effects will ever follow the &s;ame cau&s;es; and therefore you &s;hould &s;trictly attend to the operations of that ex|ten&s;ive and dangerous government which you have ju&s;t adopted. Congre&s;s is e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of finance, founded in deception, which never has been pur&s;ued by any government but to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great body of the people. Do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be lulled into a dangerous lethargy by the opinions of tho&s;e men who are looking to Congre&s;s for lucrative
<PB N="24" REF="023507_0023_0FBFCC94ED1588D0">offices, that they may be unju&s;tly &s;upported by the labor of others.&mdash;Come forward&mdash;tell your &s;ervants in Con|gre&s;s, that it is you who mu&s;t feel the effects of their Machiavelian politics; tell them the truth, and convince them that their own true intere&s;ts depend upon the ge|neral pro&s;perity of the people. Convinced that a pub|lic revenue is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, tell them that you are willing to pay a ju&s;t proportion of the annual produce of your land into the public trea&s;ury, but that the remainder &s;hall be left free at your own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>A &s;y&s;tem of &s;inance of this kind is not unprecedent|ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In China the revenue of the Sovereign is derived from the land which ri&s;es or falls with the plenty or &s;carcity of the annual produce. The public revenue in that exten&s;ive empire being immediately connected with the cul|tivation of the land; therefore Agriculture becomes an object of public at|tention.</NOTE> &mdash;The Prince of Baden, in Germany, with full con&s;ent of his &s;ubjects, has long &s;ince adopted it; in con&s;equence of which he has aboli&s;hed every &s;pecies of indirect tax, and all trafficking or commercial regula|tions, leaving the actions of his &s;ubjects totally free, except where they violate the rights of others. It is &s;aid the Duke of Tu&s;cany, and &s;ome other Princes in Europe, are about adopting &s;imilar principles of re|venue.</P>
<P>But the apparent advantages of commercial regula|tions, and of indirect taxes upon articles of con&s;ump|tion, &s;educes your government in &s;uch a manner, that although at pre&s;ent it makes this &s;y&s;tem of finance, an excu&s;e to prevent the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of foreign articles of luxury, there is great rea&s;on to apprehend that it will, in time, become the only &s;ource from whence a public revenue will be drawn&mdash;The facility of adding
<PB N="25" REF="023507_0024_0FBFCC9CEB7BD600">to the old taxes, or inventing new ones&mdash;the ea&s;e of collecting&mdash;the pecuniary advantages which a great number of citizens gain as agents, and the deception which takes place upon acquiring a revenue by an in|direct tax upon articles of con&s;umption, will all tend to e&s;tabli&s;h this de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem. The principle of fi&s;cality will pervade every department of government, and the intere&s;t of the Farmer, the mechanic, the la|borer, and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful citizens, will con&s;tantly be &s;acrificed to rich monied men, who will be always ready to become the creditors of the &s;tate, in order to enjoy, in a &s;lothful indolence, a participation of the public revenue.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem of taxation is more ruinous by its de|&s;tructive effects upon cultivation, than by the enormous expence nece&s;&s;ary to carry it into operation: and yet, if you refu&s;e to pay to government a ju&s;t proportion of the net produce of your farms, by a direct tax, and you will &s;ubmit to be deceived and ruined by the arts and projects of crafty financiers, you mu&s;t expect that, by circuitous impo&s;itions, the free &s;ale of your produce will be circum&s;cribed, and the very &s;ources of your riches will be de&s;troyed. The immutable principles of political economy cannot be diverted or fru&s;trated by the fal&s;e opinions of &s;peculative men. A con&s;tant re|venue is nec&s;&s;eary for the &s;upport of civil government; the &s;ource of &s;uch revenue &s;hould be equally certain, and therefore mu&s;t ari&s;e from the annual produce of the land.</P>
<P>The difference to the Farmer between a direct and an indirect tax, is very great. A direct tax is con|&s;ined to a ju&s;t proportion of the not produce of the land.&mdash;Indirect taxes are ob&s;cure in their operation,
<PB N="26" REF="023507_0025_0FBFCC9DDD42EFB0">devoid of all order and proportion. The money rai&s;ed by a direct tax pa&s;&s;es immediately into the public Trea|&s;ury, whil&s;t an indirect tax, upon articles of con&s;ump|tion, requires a great expence to &s;upport a ho&s;t of re|venue officers. A direct tax, being confined to a ju&s;t proportion of the net produce of your farms, can never be oppre&s;&s;ive; whil&s;t an indirect tax, preying upon the gro&s;s produce of your farms, will de&s;troy the means of future cultivation.</P>
<P>When the public revenue depends upon indirect taxes, little attention is given to economy in the ex|penditure of it. Mini&s;ters look forward to future taxes to &s;upply deficiencies, but &s;uch re&s;ources do not produce relief to &s;atisfy the demand, becau&s;e the re|venue mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed in proportion to the de&s;truc|tion of the productive fund. In this &s;tate of di&s;order the expence will always exceed the public revenue: every year will create new demands, and will augment the difficulty of providing for them. Under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances public debts mu&s;t be contracted, by which you will unju&s;tly burthen po&s;terity to di&s;charge debts contracted to &s;upport the folly and extravagance of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The dreadful example of Great Britain, and of &s;ome other nations, which have given way to the de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem of &s;upporting their governments, by procuring public credit, &s;hould be a warning to this infant repub|lic: Should we be &s;o far infatuated as to adopt &s;imilar principles of &s;inance, we mu&s;t expect that the property of our be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful citizens, will be &s;acrificed to &s;atiate the unbounded avarice of &s;tock-jobbers and u&s;urers; and the wealth of our country, wre&s;ted from nece&s;&s;ary agricultural improvements, (in which the in|tere&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="023507_0026_0FBFCC9F54726000">of the whole community is concerned) will be devoted to &s;upport the parade and di&s;&s;ipation of a few idle men, in great cities.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential object of civil &s;ociety is, to procure to every individual citizen the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s, by &s;ecuring to him the full enjoyment of his property. Under this general term is included, the property of per&s;on, the property of moveable goods, and the pro|perty of the &s;oil rendered productive by labor.</P>
<P>In the natural order of political economy, the duties and rights of men are equal. The right which cor|re&s;ponds with the ab&s;olute duty and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;atis|fying our wants, is the right of a full and entire liber|ty of our per&s;ons. To violate this right, is to de&s;troy the very intention of our exi&s;tence. Every man in your country, &s;hould be regarded as the ab&s;olute &s;o|vereign of his per&s;on. The nature of our exi&s;tence, by which we are rendered liable to con&s;tant wants, re|minds us of our duty, without the interference of go|vernment to pre&s;cribe or delimit our conduct. A wi&s;e legi&s;lature will not, therefore, interfere with the actions of citizens, <HI>except when they violate the rights of others.</HI> Make u&s;e of every means in your power to e&s;tabli&s;h this fir&s;t law of nature. The two other &s;pecies of pro|perty depends upon the unequivocal rights of our per|&s;ons. The three together will in&s;ure the pro&s;perity and &s;tability of your government.</P>
<P>Our rights over the other &s;pecies of property ari&s;e from the labor we have be&s;towed in acquiring them, or from the bounty of others: Such property can be a|lienated, as its exi&s;tence does not depend upon the life of the original proprietor.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="023507_0027_0FBFCCA219B21448">
The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence excites us to work.&mdash; The fir&s;t employ is that of hunting, or collecting the &s;pontaneous fruits of the earth: By this means, men are &s;upported during the time they are engaged in clearing the land, and rendering it productive by agriculture. The property of goods precedes the property of land, in the &s;ame manner that per&s;onal property precedes both. They are all &s;o intimately blended together, that one cannot be violated without the others &s;uffering in|jury. Of what advantage is the free di&s;po&s;al of a man's per&s;on, if the whole property acquired by his labor, is to be wre&s;ted from him by an arbitrary power? The territorial right of a government, can give it no legal authority over the property of its citizens; except as far as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the expence of protection con&s;i&s;tent with the original compact.</P>
<P>If you admit the&s;e principles to form the ba&s;is of your laws, you may expect, that the agriculture of your country will immediately revive. Under your govern|ment, men will regard their property as certain of the powerful protection of inviolable ju&s;tice, and, therefore, will inve&s;t large &s;ums of money in the cultivation of the earth, as the mo&s;t pro&s;itable employ. You be&s;t know how far an event of this importance is to be de&s;ired: Your experience has long &s;ince taught you, that land is productive in proportion to the previous expence be|&s;towed.</P>
<P>Men do not e&s;teem or value property but as they are the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it; and, therefore in a coun|try where the moveable property is not exempt from tax, and held &s;acred, the idea of wealth will only be attached to gold and &s;ilver, the amount of which, in the hands of individuals, is &s;eldom known to the pub|lic.
<PB N="29" REF="023507_0028_0FBFCCAA5C391CE8">From hence accumulation of gold will be regard|ed as the only riches of your country, and every art will be made u&s;e of to draw it from &s;trangers, not to be appropriated to the nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful improve|ments of agriculture and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, but to be ex|pended in the dainties of the table, co&s;tly equipages, and per&s;onal ornaments&mdash;The mo&s;t certain &s;ymptoms of the ruin of a &s;tate.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try of a country will ever be influenced by its laws. Oppre&s;&s;ed by unju&s;t laws, men will not inve&s;t their money in the cultivation of the land, which, to render productive, requires great expence of money, or moveable property.</P>
<P>The real wealth of a country, as ari&s;ing from agri|culture, &s;hould pay a tax to that government by which it is protected. Whatever form it may afterwards a&s;|&s;ume, or however it may change its &s;ituation, it &s;hould be left to the free di&s;po&s;al of the proprietor. This is the right of every citizen, and it is the duty of the &s;o|vereign authority to &s;upport him in &s;uch right.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of territory, without its being culti|vated, is of little value to civil &s;ociety, whether con|&s;i&s;ting of fore&s;ts or exten&s;ive plains, depopulated by oppre&s;&s;ive governments. Per&s;onal labor and move|able property are nece&s;&s;ary to render the land pro|ductive.</P>
<P>From the principles adduced re&s;pecting the public revenue due to a government, it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That civil &s;ociety has no claim upon the per|&s;on of a citizen, becau&s;e he derives this right from GOD, independent of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="023507_0029_0FBFCCAC16B589A0">
2d. That moveable property owes nothing to go|vernment, as its ju&s;t appropriation is to render the land productive; on which account it &s;hould be left to the free di&s;po&s;al of the proprietor.</P>
<P>The full liberty and &s;ecurity of the&s;e rights, &s;up|ported by the concurrence and union of men in civil &s;ociety, produces an increa&s;e of property, which is obtained from the earth by means of agriculture. The net produce of &s;uch property, together with a very &s;mall part naturally ari&s;ing from fertile &s;oils, con&s;titute the real wealth of a people, and therefore is the only &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">e from which a ju&s;t revenue can be drawn. As this advantage to individuals totally depends on the pro|tection of government, it becomes the fir&s;t duty of every citizen to &s;upport its authority and power. This pre|ference is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict ju&s;tice, becau&s;e men ac|quire the whole of &s;uch property under the protection of civil &s;ociety. The&s;e reciprocal rights and duties of the people and of the &s;overeign power, being well un|der&s;tood, and mutually &s;upported, mu&s;t render a go|vernment happy and permanent. Under its benign influence, the net produce of the land would become the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible to the emolument of the Farmer, and through him to the advantage of every individual in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Under whatever form the &s;overeign authority of a country may be admini&s;tered, it has a ju&s;t claim only to a certain proportion of the net produce of the earth, to defray the nece&s;&s;ary expence of protection, and there|fore it &s;hould be regarded as a co-partner with the pro|prietor or Farmer. In this &s;ituation it could never in|jure the rights of its citizens, without experiencing an equal injury to its own power. As the pro&s;perity and
<PB N="31" REF="023507_0030_0FBFCCAD9EBAF180">happine&s;s of the people, and the full enjoyment of their rights, is of con&s;equence to the &s;overeign authority, &s;o the pro&s;perity and power of the government is equal|ly intere&s;ting to the people under its protection. The only means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a u&s;eful and permanent a|greement between the&s;e reciprocal rights and duties, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;upported, is to e&s;tabli&s;h the ju&s;t pro|portion due to government for protection, and &s;trictly con&s;ining the appropriation of the public revenue to the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices of the &s;tate, and not &s;acrificing it to the &s;upport of a few men in lucrative or unnece&s;&s;ary offices. The power and authority of government, u|nited with the private exertions of our citizens to ren|der the land productive, would make our country po|polous and happy.</P>
<P>Such is the immutable law of political economy, or|dained by GOD to promote the happine&s;s of men united in &s;ociety, and is the only ju&s;t foundation of revenue.</P>

<P>HOW long will you &s;uffer your&s;elves to be duped by the low cunning and artifice of half-informed Law|yers, and mercenary Merchants? Are the&s;e characters to be the dictators of a free people? Are you to have no laws, no regulations, but through their influence, or by their authority?&mdash;Certainly you have not wre&s;t|ed the power from Great Britain, to place it in the hands of the&s;e men. As you value your own pro&s;pe|rity and that of your children, look well to the pre&s;ent moment: a dangerous ari&s;tocracy is forming, which if not cru&s;hed in the bud, will de&s;troy your liberties for ever: Continuing in a &s;tate of lethargy re&s;pecting pub|lic affairs, you will too late repent of your folly and negligence.</P>
<P>From whence does your government derive its au|thority for interfering in, or directing the occupation of its citizens&mdash;from whence its power of re&s;tricting the free &s;ale of the produce of your farms by commercial regulations? Are the&s;e mea&s;ures founded in wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice; or are they not rather a contemptible imi|tation of the oppre&s;&s;ive governments in Europe, where it is a political maxim, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the <HI>people</HI> poor and dependent, in order to render them &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive. This could not be effected by an equal direct tax, and therefore recour&s;e is had to indirect taxes up|on articles of con&s;umption; by which means the weal|thy citizens and great landed proprietors, do not con|tribute to the public revenue in proportion to their in|come, whil&s;t the Farmer, the mechanic, and the labor|er, are unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed. The pro&s;perity of your country does not require that a few members of &s;o|ciety &s;hould enjoy a &s;uper&s;luity of wealth, but that the great body of the people &s;hould live at their ea&s;e and be
<PB N="33" REF="023507_0032_0FBFCCBA10087A18">happy. It is the misfortune of the pre&s;ent day to connect the dignity of government, with the parade and extravagance of its officers. A more ruinous &s;y&s;|tem of policy cannot be pur&s;ued, than lavi&s;hing the property of indu&s;trious citizens upon u&s;ele&s;s offices, or in <HI>pen&s;ions</HI> to idle men in no manner engaged in pro|moting the good of the Commonwealth. The wealth of private citizens at their own free command, and employed by them&s;elves, will ever be of the greate&s;t advantage to their country. It is therefore the inter|e&s;t of every nation that &s;uch u&s;eful characters &s;hould enjoy the mo&s;t comfortable &s;upport, that thereby they may be encouraged to defend and &s;upport their coun|try in times of public danger. To make war a profe&s;|&s;ion, in order to acquire territory or riches, is to ruin the great body of citizens, to enable a few to enrich them&s;elves&mdash;be&s;ides, money thus acquired con&s;tantly brings in its train luxury, venality, ba&s;ene&s;s, and every vice which tends to the de&s;truction of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the wars which have been entered into by the kingdoms of Europe for many years pa&s;t, have been to procure to them&s;elves an exten&s;ive commerce, which has appeared to them the only &s;ource of wealth. Their politicians do not perceive that the abundance of &s;ilver, produced by commerce, terminates by de&s;troying commerce it&s;elf. The greater the quantity of money, bank notes, or any circulating paper, in a country, the greater will become the price of &s;u&s;tenance, and con|&s;equently of work; then the poorer nations will natu|rally &s;upplant their rich neighbours in their commerce. Merchants will always apply where they can be &s;upplied at the lowe&s;t rate.</P>

Your Legi&s;lators appear to forget that their country is inhabited by an independent yeomanry, who ought to be regarded as the mo&s;t valuable cla&s;s of citizens, and not &s;acrificed to the avidity of merchants, who are citizens of the world, and who know no country but their coffers of gold. The Farmer, finally, pays all the impo&s;ts, and by his indu&s;try procures from the earth the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;ociety. Merchants are in general engaged in furni&s;hing nations with u&s;e|le&s;s or unnece&s;&s;ary articles.&mdash;Their commerce would be confined within narrow limits, if they were only to &s;upply tho&s;e things nece&s;&s;ary to render life comfortable or happy. It is true, that in a country accu&s;tomed to frivolity and di&s;&s;ipation, a vitiated ta&s;te makes many things indi&s;pen&s;able; but are governments in&s;tituted to &s;upport the extravagant fancies of a few idle men, who know nothing more intere&s;ting to their country, than what will contribute to their own vanity, or grati|fication?</P>
<P>An enlightened government will ever give the great|e&s;t attention to the happine&s;s and to the pro&s;perity of its real citizens; to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s and cultivate the land: it will give every encouragement to agriculture, as the mo&s;t u&s;eful occupation in which its citizens can be employed.</P>
<P>What advantage has the yeomanry of any country derived from wars undertaken on account of commerce? Nothing but new taxes, or having their e&s;tates and the indu&s;try of their children mortgaged, to pay an annu|al and heavy intere&s;t to a few monied men.</P>

The ordinary re|venues of the &s;tate are found in&s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the additional expence occa&s;ioned by the war, and govern|ment has recour&s;e to public credit. The wealthy Mer|chant lends the money to government, and the Farmer pays the intere&s;t without receiving any benefit from the mea&s;ure. In this manner a commercial war, carried on at the expence of the lives of many valuable citi|zens, and much trea&s;ure, terminates in bringing an ad|ditional burthen on the nation. Whil&s;t it enriches merchants, financiers and u&s;urers, who may po&s;&s;e&s;s no real property in the &s;tate, and who may remove from it, as &s;oon as they have accumulated the property of its laborious citizens.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of public funds, from whence your wealthy citizens may draw an annual income, will not only become very burthen&s;ome to the indu&s;trious part of the community, but will al&s;o favor the indolence of men, who, neglecting agriculture, or any other em|ployment of real u&s;e to their country, will abandon them&s;elves to indolence, and &s;eek for amu&s;ement in the di&s;&s;ipation of your cities, which they will infe&s;t by their di&s;orderly lives.

The unju&s;t policy of nations in violating the rights of the people in favor of a few, is the fruitful &s;ource of every moral and political evil.</P>
<P>Public credit, which our politicians e&s;teem of the greate&s;t importance to government, &s;hould be regard|ed as the mo&s;t unju&s;t and ruinous invention of modern times. It is only u&s;eful and convenient to &s;erve the ambitious projects of governments, and to add to the wealth of monied men. The facility of acquiring cre|dit precipitates nations into wars and other expences beyond the revenues of the &s;tate; funding &s;y&s;tems are adopted, and peace it&s;elf does not relieve the people from oppre&s;&s;ive taxes; but the mi&s;ery of the pre&s;ent generation is unju&s;tly tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. Thus kingdoms, which pa&s;s for the mo&s;t opulent, experience real di&s;tre&s;s, and tho&s;e who govern them are continu|ally reduced to &s;eek for new expedients to &s;atisfy the demands of u&s;urers. They re&s;emble tho&s;e young men who borrow money at any rate, and mortgage their patrimony to &s;upply the extravagancies and follies of youth.</P>
<P>In Turkey, and &s;uch de&s;potic governments, where the lives and fortunes of the people are at the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate, the proper|ty of the &s;ubject is taken by force&mdash;and therefore there is no occa&s;ion to &s;upport the phantom of public credit. Free governments, unju&s;tly or weakly admini&s;tered, have recour&s;e to this de&s;tructive expedient. By dou|ceurs and great apparent advantages, men are tempted to become creditors to the &s;tate&mdash;Government finds it|&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed, and every artifice and deception is made u&s;e of to draw money from the people to &s;atisfy the demands of men, who living upon the blood of
<PB N="37" REF="023507_0036_0FBFCCC7D813ECD8">their fellow-citizens, in&s;ult them with an o&s;tentatious parade of their ill-gotten wealth.</P>
<P>An exten&s;ive public credit can be of little &s;ervice to you: it may tend to ruin your country. The cer|tainty of borrowing will precipitate your Legi&s;lators in|to unnece&s;&s;ary expences and wars, which may be a means of adding to the wealth of a few artful men, but will add nothing to the happine&s;s of the u&s;eful and laborious citizen.</P>
<P>The enormous debts, which at pre&s;ent oppre&s;s and will ruin all the great nations of Europe, has been pro|gre&s;&s;ive; and the practice of funding &s;uch debts has gradually enfeebled every &s;tate which has adopted that de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem. The republics of Venice and Genoa, have long langui&s;hed under the oppre&s;&s;ive load, and the citizens of Holland can no longer boa&s;t of en|joying their ancient liberty, whil&s;t they are under the ab&s;olute control of an ari&s;tocracy of monied men.</P>
<P>To proportion your expences to your income, is a maxim as nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to by government, as by individuals. This &s;alutary principle is de&s;pi&s;ed and neglected when public credit is too ea&s;ily acquired; and, therefore, in the place of e&s;teeming an enormous public debt as a ble&s;&s;ing, every wi&s;e and good man will regard it with anxiety and horror.</P>
<P>Let your government conduct with that degree of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, as to &s;ecure the con&s;idence and affection of the <HI>people,</HI> and it will have no occa&s;ion of rich creditors, to &s;upport its authority and dignity.</P>

<P>There is a law anterior to civil laws, the &s;upport of which ought to be the only object of government.

This exchange is a contract purely natural, where the command of property &s;hould be free in its mo&s;t exten|&s;ive &s;en&s;e.

<P>It is greatly to be lamented that the commercial re|gulations and laws of all the nations in Europe, are founded in error and inju&s;tice; and it is equally to be lamented that your &s;ervants in Congre&s;s are adopting &s;imilar mea&s;ures.

<P>It is confidently a&s;&s;erted that <HI>Great Britain</HI> owes all her power and grandeur to her <HI>navigation act.</HI>&mdash;to her <HI>exci&s;e laws</HI>&mdash;and to her commercial regulations&mdash;To tho&s;e cau&s;es &s;he is indebted for the mi&s;ery of her mo&s;t u&s;eful citizens. The grandeur and power of a nation mu&s;t be e&s;timated, not from the exuberant wealth of the few, but from the ea&s;e and pro&s;perity of the many. It is true that <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ome other parts of Britain, exhibit an appearance of wealth, little known in former days. But what is the &s;ituation of the great body of the <HI>people?</HI> Marchall and Young, two of the late&s;t and
<PB N="44" REF="023507_0043_0FBFCCDCD33D52D0">mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervers of the agriculture of England, declare that the yeomanry of that country are almo&s;t annihilated; and their manufacturers and laborers are daily becoming objects of charity. In&s;tead of being alarmed at the&s;e appearances, and &s;eeking to remedy &s;o great an evil we are told with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, thoughtle&s;s exultation, that their King was chanted in|to church by &s;even thou&s;and <HI>charity children,</HI> and that three hundred thou&s;and children belonging to <HI>parents</HI> not <HI>capable of bearing, the expence of their education,</HI> were objects of <HI>Sunday &s;chools.</HI> Whil&s;t &s;uch in&s;tances mani|fe&s;t the humanity and benevolence of that nation, they at the &s;ame time afford the mo&s;t unequivocal proof of the wretched, depending &s;ituation of the <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P>The navigation act of Britain, which appears to be the fond object of imitation with Congre&s;s, has for more than a century, &s;ubjected the indu&s;trious part of the people to a legal monopoly; it has violated the rights of the hu&s;bandman, and of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious citizens, to augment the riches of the merchants: it has impoveri&s;hed the ma&s;ters of the hou&s;e, the real citizens occupying the land, to enrich the &s;ervants; it has contributed to rai&s;e pecuniary fortunes, by which the delirium of public &s;unds has been &s;upported. The merchants of London, Bri&s;tol and other &s;ea ports, have rapidly increa&s;ed their fortunes at the expence of their fellow-citizens, and becoming of importance by the influence of their riches, they have precipitated the nation into commercial wars beyond its ability.</P>
<P>Had Britain never experienced the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of a <HI>naviga|tion act</HI>&mdash;had the indu&s;trious part of the nation been permitted to enjoy the full and ju&s;t value of the pro|duce of their labor, by a free commerce; had &s;he not
<PB N="45" REF="023507_0044_0FBFCCE26527EEB0">entered into wars to &s;upport the unbounded avarice of her merchants&mdash;had &s;he not borrowed money, and <HI>funded her debts,</HI> to enable her to carry on &s;uch wars &mdash;and had &s;he avoided <HI>exci&s;e laws,</HI> and every &s;pecies of indirect taxation; contenting her&s;elf with a ju&s;t portion of the net produce of the land, the great body of the people would enjoy a degree of ea&s;e and happi|ne&s;s to which they are now &s;trangers, and the nation it&s;elf would experience real pro&s;perity and power.</P>
<P>The raw, bulky materials, which con&s;titute the principal part of your exports, does not afford a freight to &s;atisfy your merchants; and therefore, the&s;e men, ever attentive to their private emolument, have taken the advantage of your lethargy, and have influenced Congre&s;s to enact the mo&s;t arbitrary and unju&s;t laws, &s;acrificing your rights and your property, to add to their wealth.</P>
<P>Engage your Legi&s;lators to take a &s;urvey of the ex|hau&s;ted, and almo&s;t di&s;mantled &s;tate of your farms; inform them of your poverty and inability to render your farms productive, and then let them turn their attention to the ea&s;e and affluence of the merchants, enjoying every comfort and luxury in your great cities. The contra&s;t is &s;o great that no man can think it con|&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that Congre&s;s &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a monopoly in their favor. A ju&s;t competition for the produce of your farms, being de&s;troyed by re&s;tricting foreign ve&s;&s;els from coming among&s;t us; the whole agricultural intere&s;t of your country mu&s;t depend upon the mercy of a combination of merchants.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>KNOWING what con&s;titutes your rights, you &s;hould comply with that duty you owe to your&s;elves and to your po&s;terity, and &s;upport &s;uch rights.</P>
<P>Do not &s;uffer ambitious and de&s;igning men to mi&s;|lead you into an opinion, that whil&s;t you enjoy the freedom of electing your Legi&s;lators there is no danger of your rights being violated. This is a dangerous and fal&s;e doctrine; for laws made by the immediate repre|&s;entatives of the people, are not always ju&s;t. Britain, which is regarded by many of our politicians, as an ex|ample worthy of imitation, is continually enacting laws, not only unju&s;t, but oppre&s;&s;ive to her mo&s;t valuable citizens. You can only be regarded as a free people whil&s;t your Legi&s;lature adheres &s;trictly to the laws of nature, and calculates every one of its regulations for the protection of PROPERTY, and for promoting the <HI>general happine&s;s</HI> of the community. This princi|ple is too frequently &s;tifled by the voice of avarice and ambition; the wealthy citizens, by intrigue, &s;umptuous entertainments, and bribery, influence the conduct of Legi&s;lators; and when by &s;uch means a law is obtain|ed in favor of the few, however the general rights of the community may be violated, yet it mu&s;t never be altered or repealed, from a mock apprehen&s;ion of a breach of public faith.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances of fine&s;&s;e and impo&s;ition, it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould &s;upport a regular militia; otherwi&s;e an army of mercenaries may be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to procure obedience to laws. This has taken place in England to &s;upport the mo&s;t unju&s;t and op|pre&s;&s;ive exci&s;e laws; and the Mini&s;try of that country
<PB N="47" REF="023507_0046_0FBFCCE82BAF26B8">depends more on a willing, obedient &s;oldiery, than on the ju&s;tice of laws, to procure a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them.</P>
<P>Under every government the dernier re&s;ort of the people, is an appeal to the &s;word; whether to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the open attacks of a foreign enemy, or to check the in&s;idious encroachments of dome&s;tic foes. Whenever a people are &s;o enervated by luxury, as to intru&s;t the defence of their country to a regular, &s;tanding army, compo&s;ed of mercenaries, the power of that country will remain under the direction and in|fluence of the mo&s;t wealthy citizens. The hi&s;tory of Holland and other modern republics will manife&s;t, how far a <HI>mere monied intere&s;t</HI> is to be intru&s;ted with the li|berties of the people. This &s;ubject requires your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. Whatever form your govern|ment may a&s;&s;ume, your liberties will be &s;afe as long as you &s;upport a well regulated militia. Tho&s;e who expe|rience the labor of acquiring property, will ever be the be&s;t defenders of it.</P>
