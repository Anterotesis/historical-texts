<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Public will expect no apology for the pre&s;ent collection of the&s;e letters; for it is deci&s;ive of their utility, that though the Rebels began, they have found it expedient to di&s;continue, the re-publication of them in their Gazettes.</P>
<P>They made it a que&s;tion at fir&s;t, whether Deane was the real author of them? and yet what is that to the ar|guments, if they are &s;ound and &s;ub|&s;tantial? But this point is now &s;ettled&mdash; Not one of the per&s;one to whom they are directed, has ventured to deny his receipt of the duplicate; and their pre&s;&s;es are pouring out abu&s;es upon their <HI>quondam</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, as freely as of late again&s;t General Arnold, whom

<P>It is a proof that though the domi|neering, they are the minor party, that they forbid the liberty of the pre&s;s, and in the ca&s;e of their own Amba&s;&s;a|dor's letters, dare not appeal to the under&s;tandings of the multitude; and it adds to the evidence, that &s;uch un|cea&s;ing pains are taken, to expre&s;s a joy and confidence, felt <HI>lea&s;t</HI> by tho&s;e who mo&s;t promote the &s;hew and ap|pearance.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="017509_0020_0FA125946FF5D8E8">equally pernicious to us.

We complained of England for including America in the Navigation Act, and other acts of trade, but if the naval force of that nation ro&s;e in con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e acts, into a power &s;ufficient to protect the trade of the whole empire; if the trade of America was protected thereby, could it be unrea&s;onable that the trade of America &s;hould &s;ubmit to tho&s;e acts and regulations which were the &s;ource of its protection and &s;ecurity? We complained that acts of parliament prohibited us from carrying certain articles of our produce to foreign markets, and thereby gave England a monopoly advantageous to her and injurious to us; but it mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be acknow|ledged that Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were generally re|&s;trained from purcha&s;ing and importing the &s;ame articles from other countries; &s;o that if England made a monopoly of certain articles of our pro|duce, &s;he gave us in return a monopoly of her market, and the liberty of re-exporting our goods if a better market afforded el&s;ewhere; in this, the advantage ay evidently with us; a great part of the articles thus monopolized by Eng|land, were &s;uch as could have been, and were formerly &s;upplied by foreigners at as low or lower rates than we could afford them. But the &s;y&s;tem of Great-Britain being as you know to promote the commerce of her own empire in every part
<PB N="11" REF="017509_0022_0FA1259773948B48">of it, not only re&s;traints and duties were laid on foreign importations, but bounties given to en|courage the growth and importation of many of our productions, which otherwi&s;e would not have found their way to Europe; another complaint was, that we were prohibited the taking from fo|reigners, articles, which we wanted though not the growth or fabric of England; but it is well known that tho&s;e articles concerning which &s;o much has been &s;aid, formed but a very incon&s;iderable part of our commerce.&mdash; Every one who has had an opportunity of com|paring the manufactures of one nation in Eu|rope with another, of ob&s;erving the different modes and principles of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, will at once give England and her merchants the preference. All the more &s;olid, &s;ub&s;tantial and u&s;eful articles are made better, and afforded cheaper there, than any where el&s;e, certain linens from Ru&s;&s;ia and Sile&s;ia excepted&mdash;and even tho&s;e as well as the le&s;s important foreign articles, came to us, con&s;idering the drawbacks in England on exportation, nearly, if not quite as cheap, as we could have imported them di|rectly.

The exclu&s;ion of foreigners from being the carriers for England

I believe that others as well as my&s;elf, had at that time but partially examined the &s;ubject, and in truth we know that too many of our leading pa|triots had little or no knowledge of commerce, its intere&s;ts and dependencies.&mdash;I confe&s;s that on a more exten&s;ive view, and impartial exami|nation of the &s;ubject, I think it evident that the re&s;trictions which were laid on our commerce previous to the pre&s;ent di&s;pute were over-ba|lanced by the protection, and various encou|ragements afforded to it by Great-Britain, but &s;uppo&s;ing that at the clo&s;e of the war America
<PB N="13" REF="017509_0024_0FA12599AD98B6D8">remain independent, what mu&s;t be the future &s;ituation of our commerce? Will independency at the re&s;toration of peace, give commerce &s;uch a &s;pring, procure for it &s;uch new &s;ources and encouragements as are nece&s;&s;ary, not only to revive it from the ruined &s;tate in which it now is, but to rai&s;e it &s;till higher than it has been at any former period? Or will independency prove prejudicial to the commerce of America? This is a &s;erious que&s;tion, and the importance of it mu&s;t apologize for the length of my letter. I know that I am writing to the fir&s;t commercial character in America, but I al&s;o know your candor and love of truth, and therefore I ven|ture to communicate to you my thoughts on the &s;ubject, which if ju&s;t you will approve, if erro|neous you will correct. America left at liberty will, I am per&s;uaded, take at the lea&s;t, three|fourths of all the European articles &s;he wants from Great-Britain. The &s;uperiority of the Briti&s;h manufactures, their conformity to our ta&s;te and habits; the genero&s;ity and &s;trict punctu|ality of her merchants, and above all the credit which they can give, and which no other nation can, or will give, mu&s;t &s;ecure to that nation, as great a &s;hare of our trade as I have mentioned. But how are we to pay for tho&s;e purcha&s;es? Whil&s;t we were part of the empire, Great-Britain gave a preference to our iron, naval &s;tores, pot a&s;h, flax &s;eed, timber, &amp;c. &amp;c. and encouraged the importation of them by bounties,
<PB N="14" REF="017509_0025_0FA1259A6F3FA078">and by laying heavy duties on the &s;ame articles from foreign nations. This will no longer be the ca&s;e; we have no rea&s;on to expect to be even among&s;t the mo&s;t favoured foreign nations in the Briti&s;h ports. We have imagined that Great-Britain would not &s;upport its commerce, and manufactures, without our productions and with|out our markets for a con&s;umption of theirs; this has been a&s;&s;erted, in harangues and publi|cations many thou&s;ands of times within &s;even years pa&s;t, I confe&s;s, that I once believed it&mdash; but ob&s;ervation and experience have convinced me, that we have been greatly mi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken.&mdash;Of all the articles furni&s;hed by us to Great-Britain, I know but two, tobacco and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, which can|not be obtained as good and as cheap from other countries. The con&s;umption of rice in Great-Britain, is very incon&s;iderable; and that of to|bacco, does not exceed twenty thou&s;and hog&s;|heads annually, on an average.&mdash;Other coun|tries indeed can produce both the&s;e articles at as low a price as America can, but the preference given to them from America by Great-Britain, has formerly prevented their being cultivated to any extent.&mdash;It is well known that the I&s;land of Cuba, the Coa&s;t of Brazil, and many other countries produce tobacco of a quality &s;uperior to ours.&mdash;That the Ukraine is capable of &s;upply|ing all Europe with that article: its cultivation it is true is not yet carried to perfection there, but as it is, Ru&s;&s;ia at this time exports large

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had the plea&s;ure of any letters from you &s;ince my leaving America, &s;o that though I have written &s;everal, am uncertain of any of them coming to your hand, you doubtle&s;s mu&s;t be as de&s;irous to know the true &s;tate of af|fairs on this &s;ide the water, as I am to know how things really are on yours,&mdash;the few letters I have received have been too &s;hort, and written with too much caution to give me the infor|mation I wi&s;h for, and the Americans who arrive run into &s;uch extremes that I know not what to depend on. But a few weeks before the news of the defeat of Gen. Gates in Carolina, we were told by Mr. Searle, who arrived directly from Philadelphia, that the Briti&s;h were &s;hut up, and in a manner be&s;ieged in Charle&s;town, that General Wa&s;hington's army con&s;i&s;ted of more than 20,000 men, &amp;c. others gave an account very different: In &s;hort, nothing can be more con|tradictory than the accounts given by the diffe|rent per&s;ons, who arrive in France, of the &s;tate of affairs in America. I wi&s;h you could find time and a &s;afe opportunity to &s;end me the truth, and the whole truth; I a&s;&s;ure you it would be of &s;ervice, and tend to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which flow from fal&s;e and exaggerated accounts tran&s;mitted from America, and which are repaid with intere&s;t in the account &s;ent back to you of the &s;tate of affairs in Europe. The writers and
<PB N="38" REF="017509_0049_0FA125B1AE246890">relaters of fal&s;e accounts on both &s;ides the water, have done us infinite mi&s;chief. The war it&s;elf was occa&s;ioned at fir&s;t more by them than by any other, or perhaps every other cau&s;e taken to|gether, and the continuance of it has been equally owing to them; and in the beginning of the conte&s;t, the friends of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try in America a&s;&s;ured them, that America would not per&s;evere in its oppo&s;ition, and our agents and corre&s;pondents in London encouraged us, by a&s;|&s;uring us that the majority of the nation was in our favour, that government would not go to extremities, that Parliament would, and mu&s;t recede, for that the nation was unable to make war, and to &s;upport it for any time; thus fal&s;e repre&s;entations on both &s;ides laid the foundation for the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded, and in which we are &s;till involved, and a continuation of the &s;ame kind of wrong and groundle&s;s information has kept up the action of this great tragedy of errors. You have found &s;o many of the accounts tran&s;mitted you from Europe to have been groundle&s;s, and &s;o many of the flattering encouragements and promi&s;es made you, di&s;ap|pear and vani&s;h into air their original compo&s;ition, that I pre&s;ume you would now bear to hear the truth at large, if I dared to &s;end it you, and though it is hardly &s;afe for me to do it, I dare not &s;end you any thing el&s;e&mdash;Great-Britain is neither ex|hau&s;ted nor di&s;pirited as you have been taught to believe, the Parliament appear more unani|mous

The Briti&s;h fleet is evidently &s;uperior at &s;ea to that of our ally, and the former are preparing to augment it by more than thirty new &s;hips of the line, and near forty frigates, actually on the &s;tocks&mdash;The late &s;ub&s;cription to the new loan, &s;hews that money is not wanted though the na|tional debt is become immen&s;e; this is their fituation&mdash;The &s;tate of our friends has been as greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented in America, as that of our enemies&mdash;I will not enter into particulars but I think you cannot rely on either men or &s;hips from hence, untill very late in this &s;ea&s;on if at all&mdash;Mon&s;. de Gra&s;&s;e has &s;ailed with about twenty &s;ail of the line for the We&s;t-Indies, from whence, it is &s;aid, he is ordered to America, but as Admiral Rodney has a fleet nearly equal in force, in the I&s;lands, I &s;ee no pro&s;pect of any thing deci&s;ive &s;hould &s;uch a manoeuvre be made, and &s;hould it take place, the French fleet cannot be with you before Augu&s;t, or later, and in the&s;e &s;eas the maritime force of contend|ing powers appear too nearly balanced to expect any thing of importance from them this Sum|mer&mdash;I am fully of opinion however, that Eng|land enters on this campaign with greater advan|tage, than it has began any one &s;ince France joined in the war, and if they &s;ucceed in bring|ing

This will be known in a very &s;hort time, po&s;&s;ibly before I &s;end on this letter&mdash; Our fir&s;t object of the war was the repeal of tho&s;e acts of Parliament which were injurious to our rights and privileges; before this repeal was obtained we were forced to declare Indepen|dency, and &s;olicit an alliance with France, the hereditary enemy of England&mdash;By a fortunate turn of our affairs, France was brought into an alliance with us, and to guarranty our Indepen|dence, ju&s;t at this time the Parliament of Eng|land repealed the obnoxious acts; this changed entirely the object of the war on our part as well as on that of England; it was no longer for the redre&s;s of grievances, but for &s;overeignty that we fought; at the time in which France came into a treaty of alliance with us, their object was to &s;epa|rate America forever from England, and thereby to weaken effectually, a power which for centuries pa&s;t, had given them more unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;tood more in their way than any other power in Europe, from appearances they judged that by a &s;udden declaration and vigorous exertions the point would be gained, in a very &s;hort time, and at little expence, either of men or money; that England would be brought to con&s;ent to the in|dependence of America, after which every thing el&s;e would follow of cour&s;e, and in its proper time, but the fir&s;t &s;troke failed, the favourable
<PB N="41" REF="017509_0052_0FA125B3EE32ACE8">moment was lo&s;t, and all the preparations which had been made for improving it, &s;erved only to &s;hew England the danger it had been in, and to rou&s;e the &s;pirit of the nation to make the mo&s;t vigorous exertions. From this period the ob|ject of the war became almo&s;t as much changed with France, as it had before been changed in America; at fir&s;t, it was by a &s;udden &s;troke to force England to acknowledge our independence and &s;eparation from their empire, which being done, peace mu&s;t have followed, and time will have &s;oon effected the re&s;t; but this failing, the original object was changed, or rather it was thought be&s;t to obtain it, by taking a different line of conduct. England was loaded with debt, and was violently agitated by parties, the oppo|&s;ition to Mini&s;ters in Parliament and out, was formidable, and it appeared more &s;o than it really was, from the Engli&s;h freedom of &s;peech in Parliament, and of publications out of it; America was not perfectly unanimous in any of its mea&s;ures, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;upport generally of their independency, in this they appeared &s;uf|ficiently unanimous, to prevent any fear of them falling off or accommodating. Therefore what could not be gained in one way, was to be at|tempted in another; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eakening of England was the primary and con&s;tant object, but the means for doing this were changed; it was as I have already &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to be don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by our being immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed independency, and the

But &s;uppo&s;ing that England in con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould in two or three years be reduced to receive the law from France and Spain, in what &s;ituation mu&s;t America by that time be? And to what Power can we look for relief, if France or Spain, or both, &s;hould offer to dictate the laws to us? Though this may not be the ca&s;e, yet nothing is more evident than

<P>THE famous Abbe Raynall has publi&s;hed a new edition of his <HI>Hi&s;toire Philo&s;ophique &amp; Politique.</HI> The Parliament of Paris have con|demned the book to be torn and burnt, his per|&s;on to be &s;eized, and his e&s;tate confi&s;cated.

The liberties which the Abbe has taken with the Chri&s;tian Religion, and with the political manoeuvres of France, have cau&s;ed his per&s;ecution. I am of opinion that the latter has been the principal, for it is well known that no country in Europe abounds more in Dei&s;ts and Dei&s;tical writers than this&mdash; As you mu&s;t be anxious to know the &s;entiments of this celebrated and eloquent writer with re&s;|pect to the American revolution, I have made a few extract, and would gladly oblige you with more if I had time, but having only borrowed the books, I mu&s;t return them as &s;oon as read, &s;peaking of our revolution he &s;ays.

<P>A Gentleman lately here from America, a&s;&s;ured me, that it was con&s;idered by our country|men as political here&s;y or trea&s;on to entertain a doubt that France would under any circum&s;tances whatever, give up our independency by with|drawing from its alliance with us.&mdash;This way of thinking, reflects honour on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> countrymen, as it mu&s;t proceed from their re&s;olution to &s;up|port inviolably and at all events, their own en|gagements; but too much confidence proves fa|tal to nations oftener than too little, and it is not un&s;ea&s;onable for them to review, what has &s;o frequently happened in Europe under circum|&s;tances &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, and reflect on tho&s;e in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons which the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t two centuries lays before us. What nation in Europe has not during that period broken their mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties, and de&s;erted their allies, as often as &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity or public intere&s;t and &s;afety dictated the mea&s;ure?

On an impartial review of the pa&s;t, and examination of the pre&s;ent, I confe&s;s, I think we &s;hall, and if we eventually become the dupes, and are &s;acrificed by our un&s;u&s;picious confidence, the political world will judge, at lea&s;t, that we were rather too young and unex|perienced for the great affairs we engaged in. The &s;tyle of Congre&s;s appeared to me, I con|fe&s;s, a little too &s;trong and pre&s;umptuous, when in September 1779, they declared that the inde|pendence of America was as fixed as fate; this was in a religious view, bidding defiance to Omnipotence, and placing our independence on a ba&s;is which no civil government or human &s;y&s;tem ever yet could boa&s;t of. Since my return to Europe, I have had lei&s;ure to take a calm and unprejudiced view of our &s;ituation, and however confident you may be in America, I can but have the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions for our future peace, liberty and &s;afety; not that I have more rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the good faith of France than that of any other nation, under &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances, but I have every rea&s;on to doubt of the favourable i&s;&s;ue of the war, and if it &s;hould be un&s;avourable, France has already declared to the world the part it will take with regard to our independence.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRESUMING that you &s;till continue in Con|gre&s;s, and that the friend&s;hip which has &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, remains unimpaired, I have determined to write you a long and con|fidential letter, on &s;ubjects intimately connected to the well being of our country. Some of the &s;entiments I am about to communicate, may perhaps appear incon&s;i&s;tent with my former con|duct and profe&s;&s;ions, and therefore it is incum|bent on me to explain the cau&s;es which have in any degree changed my political opinions. I need not particularly recur to the origin of the
<PB N="82" REF="017509_0093_0FA1261F2FB2F7D0">pre&s;ent controver&s;y with Great Britain; what I profe&s;&s;ed and did at that period, was profe&s;&s;ed with &s;incerity, and done with the be&s;t intentions, but had I then fore&s;een one half of the calamities that have followed the mea&s;ures of that time, in|&s;tead of approving, I &s;hould have mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed them; for it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we were actuated rather by the apprehen&s;ion of fu|ture grievances, than by the actual pre&s;&s;ure of any which we really felt; and mo&s;t certainly I &s;hould not have thought it either wi&s;e or ju&s;ti|fiable to run into the horrors of civil war, with|out more urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and a much greater load of oppre&s;&s;ion. But unfortunately, we in America were deceived by tho&s;e flattering ac|counts tran&s;mitted to us from England, as much as the Briti&s;h government was deceived by oppo|&s;ite accounts &s;ent from America. We were fully per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aded that a majority of the people of Great Britain, approved our claims, and that a &s;hort &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of commerce with that kingdom would obtain us all we de&s;ired; under this delu&s;ion we went forward until ho&s;tilities &s;uddenly began: Tho&s;e who have mo&s;t &s;tudied human nature, and the hi&s;tory of mankind, will be&s;t conceive the effects and changes which followed: Inflamed and afterwards exa&s;perated by the provocations and ravages of war, our minds became gradually alienated from that people who&s;e ance&s;tors were ours, and to whom we had always been connected by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, that can bind or unite &s;o|cieties
<PB N="83" REF="017509_0094_0FA1261FED929870">of men. We indignantly &s;lighted that union which had been e&s;teemed our greate&s;t glory and happine&s;s, and under who&s;e benign influence we had increa&s;ed and pro&s;pered beyond example.

Of all the various objections that have been made on this &s;ubject at different times and by different people, there are but two which de&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t notice. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is, that the &s;olemn acts and declarations of the King and Parliament of Great Britain, are not to be re|lied upon; That when we &s;hall have laid down our arms, former pretentions may be revived and new acts of Parliament made to &s;ubject our rights, &amp;c. If there be any force in this objec|tion it will operate even more &s;trongly again&s;t negociating for peace than for reconciliation; a treaty of peace would be an act of the crown only, and might be more ea&s;ily evaded than a &s;olemn compact, in which the Parliament as well as the King would be a party. Tho&s;e therefore who from apprehen&s;ions of this nature, refu&s;e treating for reconciliation, &s;hould not think of treating for peace, they &s;hould re&s;olve to pro&s;e|cute the war with unrelenting fury; to reprobate the folly of Congre&s;s in &s;ending Mr. Adams to negociate with Great-Britain, they &s;hould forget how often that nation has interpo&s;ed to &s;ave the civil and religious liberties of other countries a|gain&s;t the ambitious views of France and Spain, and regardle&s;s of the danger of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lling under the power of the&s;e our new friends, they &s;hould re|&s;olve never to &s;heath the &s;word until the Briti&s;h

But what renders this ob|jection more contemptible is, that it proceeds from tho&s;e very men who were mo&s;t active in evading and violating the mo&s;t &s;olemn engage|ments, and the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations of ju&s;tice re&s;pecting the redemption and value of the Con|gre&s;s bills of credit.

<PB N="114" REF="017509_0125_0FA125C8ED56A8B0">of it promoted our public mea&s;ures; but my jealou&s;y and zeal were naturally extingui&s;hed when Congre&s;s on the 18th of March, 1780, committed that very act, which, but &s;ix months before, they had unanimou&s;ly and publicly re|probated as <HI>"excerable deed,"</HI> an <Q><HI>unpardonable &s;in,</HI></Q> and which, by their own judgment and &s;entence would ju&s;tly <Q><HI>render us a reproach and a bye-word among the nations of the Earth,</HI></Q> and make us <HI>"appear like a common pro&s;titute among cha&s;te and re&s;pectable matrons, &amp;c"</HI>&mdash; Such being our &s;ituation, &s;uch our crime and puni&s;hment, according to the deci&s;ion and &s;en|tence of our own repre&s;entative.

It has already been demon&s;trated, that the French government con&s;iders it&s;elf, as at liberty, to de&s;ert us at the end of an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucce&s;sful war, and con&s;equently we mu&s;t be entitled to the &s;ame liberty, and to the &s;ame interpretation of our engagements.&mdash; Should we continue independent, our treaties with France ought to be mo&s;t &s;acredly fulfilled, but we never could have intended by tho&s;e trea|ties,

I have been as you well know mo&s;t ready to magnify our obligation to the French, as well from my per&s;onal regard to that nation, as from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the appearance of gra|titude on our &s;ide would produce beneficial ef|fects. I was willing even to err by an exce&s;s of grateful &s;entiments towards our new ally, &s;o long as that exce&s;s appeared harmle&s;s, but when a claim on our gratitude is &s;et up, and oppo&s;ed to the peace and happine&s;s of millions, it becomes proper at lea&s;t to enquire if it is well &s;ounded? In what, let me a&s;k are we obliged to France? She &s;carcely knew a &s;ingle individual of our country, and therefore could not have been ac|tuated by any motive of regard for us, at the time when &s;he began to afford us &s;ecret a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. It is with reluctance that I enter on the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, even privately with you, but it is as ea&s;y, as it is expedient to a&s;cer|tain the views of the French government and its

In &s;imilar circum&s;tances as much a&s;&s;i&s;tance would have been given to any other people under heaven, and there can be no cau&s;e for gratitude for any aid given in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, and with &s;uch views. The fir&s;t an of the French government evidently was to a&s;&s;i&s;t us ju&s;t &s;o far as might be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent an accommodation, and to give this a&s;|&s;i&s;tance with &s;o much &s;ecrecy as to avoid any rupture with Great Britain.

It was per|ceived, or at lea&s;t believed, that nothing &s;hort of an open declaration in our favour, would pre|tract the quarrel, or prevent our reconciliation with Great Britain; and it was apprehended, that when reconciled, both countries might turn their force again&s;t France,&mdash;England from re|&s;entment for what had been done, and America for what had been refu&s;ed for our &s;upport. The French Mini&s;try then appeared, for the fir&s;t time, to think &s;eriou&s;ly of promoting a final &s;e|paration between us and our parent country, being convinced, from the &s;trength which we had manife&s;ted, in &s;ingly re&s;i&s;ting the power of Great Britain, and the general di&s;couragement which notoriou&s;ly prevailed in that nation, that
<PB N="120" REF="017509_0131_0FA125CE2E6211B8">&s;uch a &s;eparation might be effected with but little difficulty, and no danger to France.</P>
<P>The propo&s;als of Congre&s;s, therefore, which had been le&s;t twelve months unnoticed, were &s;uddenly accepted, and the treaties &s;peedily con|cluded, and afterwards ha&s;tily announced to the world, in order to fru&s;trate the pacific endea|vours of the Briti&s;h Government, and engage us to reject it's liberal offers, for promoting a re|conciliation. Having been per&s;onally engaged in concluding and &s;igning the treaties with France and per&s;onally favoured and obliged to it's Government, and being al&s;o per&s;uaded as I then was, that tho&s;e treaties would prove infi|nitely beneficial to our country, I very naturally approved of their ratification, and of the rejec|tion of all terms offered by the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;i|oners. Situated as I then was, and thinking as I then did, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to act other|wi&s;e; but yet I &s;hall for ever regret, that a ma|jority of our countrymen were not wi&s;e enough to know, and pur&s;ue their own intere&s;ts, and to accept of offers, which contained every thing conducive to their future peace and pro&s;perity, and which, had the, been accepted, would have &s;aved us and our parent country innumerable calamities, and have pre&s;erved thou&s;ands of u&s;e|ful rives, with oceans of kindred blood, which have been &s;ince offered up as a &s;acrifice to our idol, Independency.&mdash;Unhappily that time and opportunity were irrecoverably lo&s;t, and all re|grets

<P>It is to be remembered, that before France en|tered into the war, we had alone &s;upported a very unequal conte&s;t with Great-Britain for near three years, and had thereby incurred an enor|mous debt, and nearly exhau&s;ted all our credit and re&s;ources; it might therefore have been ex|pected from the terms of our engagement, that in&s;tead of continuing to bear an unequal &s;hare of the burthen, our own proportion would have been lightened by our Ally, in con&s;ideration of what we had previou&s;ly done and &s;uffered alone; but has this been in any degree the ca&s;e?

It is not until &s;ince the alarming revolt of the Penn&s;ylvania and Jer&s;ey troops, that this government could ever be brought to promi&s;e a &s;ingle &s;hilling towards paying the army in America, and the &s;um now granted is placed under the direction of General Wa&s;hing|ton, in a way that manife&s;ts a total want of con|fidence in Congre&s;s, and renders the General in effect independent of the body by whom he is commi&s;&s;ioned, and who will not dare either to di&s;mi&s;s, or even to di&s;oblige him; becau&s;e with|out his concurrence, the army cannot obtain a &s;ingle &s;hilling.

<P>Re&s;pecting the &s;ea and land forces &s;ent at dif|ferent times to America, they doubtle&s;s were never &s;uited nor intended to drive the Briti&s;h forces out of the United States, probably this government thinks that &s;o great a part of the Briti&s;h forces can no where be employed and wa&s;ted &s;o advantageou&s;ly for France, as in fight|ing again&s;t the people of America, where they can do no harm to the French nation, and where we are under the nece&s;&s;ity of oppo&s;ing them, but were the Briti&s;h fleets and armies transferred from the continent to the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, it would depend on our inclination, whether we followed them or not, and in either ca&s;e but e&s;pecially in the latter, the French and Spani&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would be in imminent danger.

<P>In 1775, the number of inhabitants amounted to about three millions, &s;ettled on a &s;ea coa&s;t of near 1500 miles in extent, with an immen&s;e continent be|hind them, fettile and uninhabited, except by a few wandering &s;avages; and being all employed (a very few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the innocent and healthful bu&s;ine&s;s of cultivating the earth, this, &s;tock of inhabitants, independent of importations increa&s;ed at the rate of doubling or cent per cent. every twenty years; their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> exportations, which con&s;i&s;ted in all kinds of provi&s;ions, in lumber, tobacco, indigo, and other produce of the country, amounted to nearly three millions and an half &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing.</P>

<P>This annual exportation, of three millions and an half, was not a clear profit in favour of America, for the greate&s;t part of it, and at times the whole, was returned in foreign commodities, part of which might have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, but at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that if<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ta&s;ie for

But tho&s;e claims being now out of the que&s;tion, and America offered the peaceable enjoyment of this capital with all its encrea&s;ing advantages, &s;ecured and guaranteed under the Briti&s;h empire, it is evident that in pro|ceeding to &s;tate the account of our expences and lo&s;&s;es, previous to this, &s;tand as &s;o many charges, incurred in defending and &s;ecuring our original ca|pital &s;tock, that effected, every thing further mu&s;t be charged again&s;t independent &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>This account is mo&s;t unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t im|portant that America, or perhaps any other country, ever had to con&s;ider and to &s;tate fairly, without pre|judice or partiality, and I tru&s;t my hone&s;t and brave countrymen, will view it in this right, that they will e&s;timate without exaggerating, or dimini&s;hing, what their lo&s;&s;es and expences have actually been, &s;ince the pre&s;ent object of independent &s;overeignty, has been
<PB N="viii" REF="017509_0160_0FA125E4ADBD9458">the only one in que&s;tion, what the &s;ituation of our country has been ever &s;ince it has been claimed and exerci&s;ed, what our circum&s;tances now are, what they were previous to this conte&s;t or to 1763, and from comparing the pre&s;ent, with the pa&s;t, form a true judgment on the whole to direct their future con|duct. In the beginning of 1778 an offer was made to America to be placed in the &s;ituation it was in, at, and previous to the year 1763, to have all the griev|ances complained of by Congre&s;s in 1774 and 1775 redre&s;&s;ed, to have the acts which they remon&s;trated again&s;t, and which were then declared to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ole cau&s;e of the war, revealed, and &s;everal advantages granted to America, which the inhabitants had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, previous to 1763, either claimed or enjoyed, had the&s;e offers been accepted of, the account would then have been clo&s;ed (as I have already &s;hewn) in our fa|vour. But independent &s;overeignty was by Congre&s;s made an e&s;&s;ential prelimenary, <HI>a &s;ine qua non,</HI> of any negociation at all. In July 1776, the above terms had not been offered to us, and a per&s;ua&s;ion that England would not recede &s;o far, as to offer them was the prin|cipal ground on which that re&s;olution was taken. All the declarations of Congre&s;s and of the different American a&s;&s;emblies prove the truth of this fact; the declaration of independence it&s;elf acknowledges it, and the arguments made u&s;e of in &s;upport of the mea&s;ure were all drawn from that pre&s;umption only, Foreign aid was &s;ollicited, this could neither he a&s;ked or granted con&s;i&s;tently with the laws of nations, and the &s;aith of treaties, whil&s;t we a knowledged our|&s;elves to be the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, therefore being re&s;olved to de&s;erd our rights, the foreign aid &s;ollicited, became indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil government in the &s;everal pro|vinces
<PB N="ix" REF="017509_0161_0FA125E5703BDAC8">equally &s;o, to prevent general anarchy and con|fu&s;ion. On this ground, and on this only, Congre&s;s were forced into a mea&s;ure, which they had before reprobated in all their public declarations.&mdash; In their petition and addre&s;s to the King, and people of England, in 1774, and 1775, they &s;olemnly cal|led God to witne&s;s, that they had no view of a &s;epa|ration, and that they regarded &s;uch an event as the greate&s;t of evils, which could befall both countries. I dare appeal to the warme&s;t &s;upporter of the Decla|ration of July, 1776, to &s;ay, if the &s;ame offers had been made on the part of England, as were made in 1778, any &s;uch re&s;olution would have pa&s;&s;ed in C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gre&s;s, or in any one of the American a&s;&s;emblies.

<P>The number of hou&s;es, in a country where the materials for building are found in plenty, and co&s;t little more than the charge of collecting them to|gether, will ever be in proportion to the number of inhabitants; but there are not at this time more hou&s;es in America, than there were in 1775, whereas by the above calculation, they would, had we been at peace, have increa&s;ed near one third. In the Autumn 1774, upwards of five hundred hou&s;es were contracted for to be built in Philadelphia the next year. Other Towns were in proportion to that City. The in|crea&s;e of hou&s;es in country Towns and Villages was &s;uch, that the articles of nails, window gla&s;s, and other nece&s;&s;ary materials for building, formed a very capital part of our imports; I will not pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, the&s;e ob&s;ervations being &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the pre&s;umption, that the number of inhabitants has not increa&s;ed to any con&s;iderable amount &s;ince the war. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain this with certainty, as no exact numbering was ever made; the aggregate of three millions was a pre&s;umed one, from the general e&s;timate made by the Delegates from
<PB N="xiii" REF="017509_0165_0FA125E870802728">different parts of the continent. But the number of hou&s;es not having increa&s;ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or hou&s;e rent advanced, convinces me that there has been but little, or no in|crea&s;e &s;ince the war. The annual importation of in|habitants, amounted to near 20,000 one year with another; the &s;topping of this &s;ource of population, our lo&s;s of men by the war, the continual emigra|tions from us to Europe and the We&s;t-Indies, and the before unexperienced ob&s;tacles and difficulties, in the way of e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;upporting families, ap|pear to me &s;ufficient to have prevented any increa&s;e of our numbers. To this immen&s;e lo&s;s of inhabi|tants, we may ju&s;tly add tho&s;e, who by a military life, or otherwi&s;e, in con&s;equence of the war have acquired &s;uch di&s;&s;ipated habits, that they cannot be expected to return to their old indu&s;trious and lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|rious employments.</P>
<P>This great and capital lo&s;s, has been attended with another naturally and nece&s;&s;arily connected with it, and with the lo&s;s of commerce, viz. the de|cline of agriculture, and reduction of our exports.

I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that all our importations were wi&s;ely made, or that many of the articles were &s;uch as we had better have been without, for admitting of this,
