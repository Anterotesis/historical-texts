<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> BRETHREN <HI>and</HI> COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MADNESS in any Society of Peo|ple is generally a Fore-Runner of their De&s;truction. For, before <HI>the Almighty</HI> de&s;troys a Nation or People, he permits them fir&s;t to be &s;o infa|tuated as to run into Extravagancies, which by natural Con&s;equences, bring De&s;tructi|on upon them. The Ma&s;&s;acre of the In|dians at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and the too general Ap|probation it has met with, are Evidences of very great Madne&s;s: And that Calamities, by Occa&s;ion thereof, are impending over us, will appear from the following Con|&s;iderations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>To put any Man to Death (tho' in open War) when he may be made a Pri&s;oner, is contrary to the Laws of Nations.</P>
<P>UNDER the <HI>Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> we find the Jews, who were under the immediate Direction of GOD him&s;elf, ob&s;erving and performing their Treaties with great Punc|tuality.&mdash;Thus the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were &s;par|ed, becau&s;e of the Publick Faith of the
<PB N="4" REF="009834_0003_0F7A50106CCAD3D0"><HI>I&s;ralites</HI> plighted to them, tho' the &s;ame was obtained by Fraud and Fal&s;hood. And we find the good old Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> by divine In&s;piration, on his Death-Bed; bit|terly cur&s;ing two of his Sons; becau&s;e of the Murder of <HI>Schechem</HI> and his Family, in cool Blood, after Peace had been con|cluded; tho' before he had committed a Crime worthy of Death.</P>
<P>IT is a fundamental Law of all <HI>civil Go|vernments,</HI> that no Per&s;on &s;hall put another to death by his own Authority, let him have committed what Crime he may, if he can, with Safety be apprehended, &s;o as to be brought to Tryal by the Laws of the Community.</P>
<P>To make War on one Nation for the Offences of another Nation; or to &s;lay one Man for the Crime of another, &s;eems con|trary to <HI>natural Ju&s;tice.</HI> But to butcher Infants at the Brea&s;t, in capable of di&s;tingu|i&s;hing between Right and Wrong, for the Crimes of their Parents, or of the Nation to which they belong, or perhaps only for the Crimes of <HI>other</HI> Nations of the &s;ame Colour, is &s;hocking to every Per&s;on who has the common Feelings of Humanity. The
<PB N="5" REF="009834_0004_0F7A5012AD9D6228">Vi&s;iting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children can only be under&s;tood of &s;uch Children, who, from the Examples of their Fathers (which is too commonly the Ca&s;e) pur&s;ue the &s;ame vicious Cour&s;es. For to under&s;tand it otherwi&s;e, would be incon|&s;i&s;tent with the moral Government of the <HI>Divine Being;</HI> who, by the Prophet has forbid to u&s;e this Proverb; "the Fathers have eaten &s;ower Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are &s;et on Edge: Becau&s;e the Soul that &s;inneth, &s;hall die, and the Son &s;hall not bear the Iniquity of the Father."</P>
<P>To apply the&s;e Doctrines to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of the Indians, let us con&s;ider;</P>
<P>THAT the Indians con&s;i&s;t of different Na|tions or Tribes independent of one another, and make War or Peace &s;eparately without each others Con&s;ent,&mdash;Some indeed for their mutual Protections have joined in A&s;&s;ociations, like tho&s;e of the Swi&s;s Can|tons, or the united Provinces. The Ca|no&s;togoe Tribe in the Year 1701. con|firmed a Grant of their Land to <HI>W. Penn;</HI> and, by a &s;olemn Treaty with this Govern|ment, agreed to live together with us as
<PB N="6" REF="009834_0005_0F7A5012C80CDE08" MS="y">one People. A &s;mall Spot of Land was a&s;&s;igned to them to live upon: And, tho we did not make them Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water, they have continu|ed there ever &s;ince, in no better Conditi|on, than that of poor Basket-Makers and Broom-Makers. If &s;ome of them have, now and then, been guilty of Offences, they were always ready to be apprehended and brought to Tryal: And indeed, from the prevailing odium again&s;t Indians in general, if a Jury could be pre&s;umed to be bya&s;&s;ed, 'tis mo&s;t likely they would be &s;o, in Favour of the Pro&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>DURING all the Time of our late Troubles they lived quietly and peaceably among&s;t us, and &s;ome of them have been employed by the Government.</P>
<P>BUT, notwit&s;tanding all this, an enraged Body of People, irritated by the Murders of &s;ome of their Relatives, <HI>by Indians of other Nations,</HI> on the Frontiers, came to the Indian Town and killed and &s;calped &s;ix of them, in cool Blood. The Re&s;idue of the whole Tribe, being fourteen in Number, in Pur&s;uance of Promi&s;es made at &s;olemn Treaties, immediately upon this,
<PB N="7" REF="009834_0006_0F7A5013B948B028">put them&s;elves under the Protection of the Magi&s;trates, and were lodged in the Work-Hou&s;e; which is Part of the Publick Goal in <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> But this was in vain. For a Party of fifty Men came to the Goal in broad Day-light; broke it open, and bar|barou&s;ly murdered tho&s;e Indians, not &s;paring a Woman Seventy-&s;even Years of Age, nor a Child &s;ucking it's Mother's Brea&s;t. Now I appeal to every Man, who will give him&s;elf Leave to con&s;ider, if &s;uch an Act be not contrary to the Laws both divine and human, which I mentioned before.</P>
<P>BUT the immediate apparent Con&s;e|quences of this tumultuous Riot, and atroci|cous Murder, is an additional Proof of the Infatuation of the&s;e People and their A|betors.</P>
<P>IT appears, from the publick Papers, that Negotiations for a general Peace with the Indians were in great Forwardne&s;s, which the&s;e unlucky Affairs mu&s;t greatly retard, if not altogether prevent. For, how can Indians, who have been <HI>at War</HI> with us, confide in the Promi&s;es of the Go|vernment, when they find that Govern|ment
<PB N="8" REF="009834_0007_0F7A5014388A9C00">unable to protect the friendly In|dians, who have always been <HI>at Peace</HI> and have claimed it's Protection, from the Out|rages of our own bad People! To extir|pate the Indians is impracticable: It has been &s;aid (and I believe with a great deal of Rea&s;on) that all the Forces in <HI>Europe</HI> could not totally de&s;troy them. The Ca|naanites will &s;till be in the Land. And while we continue at Enmity with them, they will be Thorns in our Sides, and Bri|ars in our Eyes.&mdash;We have a long extended Frontier; to defend, all of which, from the Attacks and Incur&s;ions of Savages, is impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;And the&s;e unhappy People who have committed this Outrage, if they had not been demented, ought, from their expo&s;ed Situation, to have been the mo&s;t cautious of doing any Act which might prevent &s;uch a Peace. On the contrary their Friend&s;hip might be of very great Benefit to us.&mdash;The Skins and Furrs are great Weights in the Ballance of Trade between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and us. Exchange is there|by lowered, and con&s;equently the Prices of Goods which we import.</P>
<P>ANOTHER apparent bad Con&s;equence is,
<PB N="9" REF="009834_0008_0F7A5014EF46FB48">unle&s;s the Indians have more Humanity than &s;ome of us, who profe&s;s, to have re|ceived the Light of the Go&s;pel, and to be Followers of the Prince of Peace; We can|not expect but that the Pri&s;oners, of our own Blood, who are now among&s;t them, will &s;hare the &s;ame Fate with the unhappy Wretches in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> Goal.</P>
<P>THIS Province has been a Land of Li|berty; and Ju&s;tice has hitherto been <HI>ef|fectually</HI> admini&s;tred, without A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Military Force. It has al&s;o been an A|&s;ylum for People of tender Con&s;ciences, who removed hither for the Liberty of wor&s;hipping the <HI>Supream Being,</HI> in the Manner they believed mo&s;t agreeable to Him. The&s;e ine&s;timable Privileges in|duced our Ance&s;tors to leave their Native Land, to encounter the Dangers of the Deep, and &s;ettle in this Howling Wilder|ne&s;s; which is now become a fertile Field, a Land of Plenty. But alas! is it likely we &s;hall long enjoy the&s;e Privileges? Can you imagine that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will &s;uffer the Admini&s;trations of Ju&s;tice in &s;o valu|able a Province as <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to be inter|rupted; the Goals broke open; the Civil
<PB N="10" REF="009834_0009_0F7A5015B06DCBF0">Officers in&s;ulted; Trade rendered pre|carious; and every Thing put into Con|fu&s;ion, by a <HI>Mob?</HI> No certainly!</P>
<P>INSURRECTIONS which had but &s;mall Be|ginnings have often aro&s;e to great Heights; Becau&s;e, when once a Mob have broke through the Limits pre&s;cribed by the Laws, 'tis uncertain, how far they will wander in the Fields of Anarchy and Confu&s;ion; and what Extravagancies they will run into which at fir&s;t they did not De&s;ign. If the&s;e People &s;hould take it into their Heads, not to pay Taxes, or not to pay the Proprie|taries for their Lands, or the Merchants for their Goods; what would be the Con|&s;equence? Is it not highly probable, that, to prevent the like, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Govern|ment will oblige us to maintain a Military Force to &s;upport the Civil Authority; and <HI>dragoon</HI> us into our Duty, <HI>at our own Expence!</HI> The Iron Rod of Military Power mu&s;t correct tho&s;e who are deaf to the Voice of Rea&s;on and &s;uperior to the Fear of the Laws.&mdash;Great is the Law, it mu&s;t, and it will prevail. Whoever thinks him&s;elf exempted from the civil Juris|diction only gnaws a File, which will
<PB N="11" REF="009834_0010_0F7A5017320BC098">break his Teeth.&mdash;Be&s;ides, as 'tis currently reported, that the&s;e Outrages, Tumults and In&s;urrections have been excited ex|ecuted, and abetted, principally and chiefly, if not altogether, by Per&s;ons di&s;|&s;enting from the Church e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>England;</HI> it is too likely, if they are re|peated and encouraged, that every Per&s;on who would bear an Office mu&s;t conform to the Rites of that Church, in the &s;ame Manner as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>FROM all the&s;e Hints, which I have thrown together, without Order or Me|thod, I hope you will be convinced, that it is your Duty to U&s;e your Influ|ence with the&s;e deluded People, to de|&s;i&s;t from their intended Enterprize; and that you will endeavour to convince them of their Error in what they have already done. Why &s;hould they be rendered de&s;perate by having a Price &s;et upon their Heads, like Wolves? Why &s;hould they have a Mark &s;et upon them; and wander like Fugitives and Vagabonds in continual Fear? Or why &s;hould we be put to the Expence of maintaining an Army in Time of Peace, which we
<PB N="12" REF="009834_0011_0F7A5017EDAD63D0">might have done without? Or pay Tithes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to Clergy, whom many of us do not choo&s;e to hear preach? Or why &s;hould you deprive your&s;elves of filling the Po&s;ts you are otherwi&s;e qualified for, by vindicating a wrongheaded Mob?</P>
<P>THE lower Sort of People are very imitative of their Superiors.&mdash;They watch their Motions, Looks and Eyes:&mdash;If there|fore the more &s;en&s;ible Part of you would openly avow your Di&s;approbation of the&s;e Mea&s;ures, you will find this Rage and Clamour will &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide; The&s;e People will di&s;per&s;e; they will crumble like the Du&s;t, and di&s;appear [at lea&s;t in a ho&s;tile Manner] like the Snow that melted ye&s;ter|day.</P>
