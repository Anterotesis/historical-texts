<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS, AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO weep over the tomb of the patriot&mdash;to drop a tear to the memory of tho&s;e unfortunate citizens, who fell the fir&s;t &s;acrifi|ces to tyranny and u&s;urpation is noble, generous and humane. Such are the &s;entiments that influence you, my countrymen, or why through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods, with heartfelt &s;en&s;ations, have you attended this &s;olemn anniver&s;ary, and paid this &s;ad tribute to the memo|ry of your &s;laughter'd brethren. Nor is the circle contracted&mdash;The mo&s;t ami|able part of the creation &s;hare the grief, and, &s;oft pity beaming in their coun|tenances, like <HI>the daughters of I&s;rael,</HI> annually lament the fate of others, and weep over the mi&s;eries of their country. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judges 11th, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, 40.</NOTE> Come then, my friends, let us enter the &s;olitary courts of death, and perhaps an hour &s;pent in &s;uch reflections, may afford as &s;olid improvement as nature <HI>in her gaye&s;t &s;cenes.</HI></P>
<P>To commemorate the deaths of tho&s;e men who fell unhappy victims to bru|tal violence&mdash;To &s;how the dangerous tendency of &s;tanding armies in populous cities in time of peace, the origin of this fatal cata&s;trophe&mdash;to trace its con|nexion and effects, as they have been, and are now di&s;play'd, in different parts of America, I take to be the de&s;ign of this day's &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>It appears to me needle&s;s to enter into the nature and ends of civil govern|ment, and to evince that &s;tanding armies are a &s;oleci&s;m in &s;uch a con&s;titution. Such &s;entiments are founded in nature, and have for ages, under different forms, and different meridians, been fully di&s;play'd by men who knew the rights of nature and mankind. The names of LOCK, SYDNEY &amp; HAMPDEN have long been illu&s;trious, and my countrymen are too well acquainted with their writings, not to venerate their memories. Nor can I forget the &s;ame &s;entiments which have charm'd you from the lips of men, who have &s;poke be|fore me on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, who&s;e characters will be ever dear, and the ex|ertions of who&s;e patrioti&s;m and virtue exhibited in the mo&s;t critical &s;ituations, po&s;terity will ever wonder at and revere.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to confirm this point by logical conclu&s;ions mu&s;t be an u&s;ele&s;s mi&s;|&s;pen&s;e of time. Even a crown lawyer, who&s;e &s;entiments are not always friend|ly to the rights of mankind will tell us, <Q>In a land of liberty, it is extremely
<PB N="6" REF="015725_0005_0F9B2AAF50452558">dangerous to make a di&s;tinct order of the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. In ab&s;olute monarchies this is indeed nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>&s;afety of the prince,</HI> and ari&s;es from the <HI>main principle</HI> of their con&s;titution, which is, governing <HI>by fear:</HI> but in free &s;tates, the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier, taken <HI>&s;ingly</HI> and <HI>merely</HI> as a profe&s;&s;ion, is ju&s;tly an object of jealou&s;y. The laws therefore, and con|&s;titution of the&s;e kingdoms, know no &s;uch thing as a <HI>perpetual, &s;tanding</HI> &s;oldier. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone's Commentaries, Vol. 1&s;t. Pag. 407.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Arguments exi&s;ting in theory, however the mind may be captivated, do not always convince, and con&s;equences traced from the &s;ame &s;ource are &s;eldom intere&s;ting. But when we find the apprehen&s;ions of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of mankind, who actuated by a principle of benevolence, felt for the common intere&s;ts, fully di&s;play'd in awful and tremendous effects, we then &s;tart from our lethargy, and like the &s;en&s;itive plant, &s;hrink from approaching danger! &s;uch is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject before us. Philo&s;ophers and &s;tate&s;|men have &s;hewn how dangerous &s;tanding armies <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be in a free &s;tate, and every page in the volume of mankind confirms the melancholy account.</P>
<P>Speculative writers may indeed tell us, that the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution exi&s;t in every body politick&mdash;that like the body natural it mu&s;t decay and die&mdash;and that the &s;ame cau&s;es which brought the empires of <HI>Belus</HI> and <HI>Cyrus</HI> to de&s;|truction will &s;ap every other government on earth. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Beilz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">rius by M. Maimontall.</NOTE> For my own part I am no fatali&s;t, and <HI>nil de&s;perandum pro republica,</HI> is to me a much preferable, and more generous motto. And in&s;tead of enumerating their many vices and corruptions as the <HI>original cau&s;e,</HI> I think a little acquaintance with hi&s;tory will inform us, that they are not merely the original cau&s;e, but <HI>con&s;equences</HI> re&s;ulting from the fatal mea&s;ure, we are con&s;idering. In ab&s;olute monarchies, where the military is the principal engine of government, we are not to look for a confirmation of this argument. But in republics, till the introduction of a &s;oldiery di&s;tinct from the citizens, we find them as remote from corrup|tion, luxury, and the other black catalogue of vices as any human &s;y&s;tem can attain to. But when &s;tanding troops were introduced, they immediately fol|lowed. Depravity of manners&mdash;a di&s;like to virtue and manly &s;entiment&mdash;effeminacy, and tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er vices, too indelicate to be mentioned in this place, &s;talk'd like daemons through their cities. Witne&s;s, ye republics, that were once great and illu&s;trious, but are now no more! witne&s;s O Bo&s;ton! for ye were too well acquainted with the melancholy truth!</P>
<P>We will now confirm the &s;entiment by a brief in&s;pection into &s;ome parts of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> were a republic that in a &s;hort fright of years, exhibited the mo&s;t glorious &s;pectacle, that ever appeared to mankind; and, as one ob&s;erves, the age they liv'd in, &s;eem'd to be the golden period of human nature. In
<PB N="7" REF="015725_0006_0F9B2AB003BB4AB0">every branch of war or peace, in every &s;pecies of &s;cience they excelled, and were at once fear'd, admir'd and venerated by the other nations of the world. Yet this heroic confederacy was originally reduced from this glorious &s;uperio|rity by the arts of <HI>one</HI> man. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;i&s;tratus.</NOTE> Under the idea of a guard, from an incon&s;i|derable number of attendants, he increa&s;ed to that &s;tretch of power as proved the fatal &s;tab to the vitals of his country. The bank thus broken down, the tide &s;well'd toorapid to be &s;temm'd, and virtue, freedom and the laws all fell a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Similar was the &s;ituation of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Although not &s;o univer&s;ally dis|tingui&s;hed as the <HI>Greeks</HI> yet from the expul&s;ion of their kings, to the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> they evinced to what a prodigious greatne&s;s mankind may arrive when actuated by the principles of liberty, virtue and honor. Influenced by &s;uch motives, no wonder their actions were conformable; and while the mo&s;t rigid inflexibility pre&s;ided at home, the Roman eagle &s;lew to the remote&s;t corner of the globe.</P>
<P>Can we then &s;uppo&s;e when we view the characters which appeared on the &s;tage at this period&mdash;when we con&s;ider how remote they were from tho&s;e vi|ces which have been prevalent in powerful monarchies, and how carefully they watch'd the &s;acred altar of freedom, that they them&s;elves mu&s;t remain a &s;tand|ing monument of the con&s;equences of this fatal mea&s;ure. Such is the ca&s;e. Marius in new modelling the legions, and replacing the citizens who &s;erved in them with foreign mercenaries laid the horrid foundation. The door was now open for one <HI>too powerful citizen</HI> after another, until <HI>Ca&s;ar,</HI> lo&s;ing every check, and laughing at the impotent anathemas of the &s;enate, with the di&s;tant legions march'd to Rome, and formed a new aera in their hi&s;tory. From this period weare charmed no more with illu&s;trious actions, and the la&s;t remains of dignity, &s;unk in the Roman world. So true is it, that when a people lo&s;e their liberty, they at once become fit &s;ubjects of every thing ba&s;e and infamous.</P>
<P>We have thus far produced in&s;tances of the fatal effects of armies thus kept up, which have ended in the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the laws and government of two of the mo&s;t memorable republics in antient &s;tory. We will now &s;hift the &s;cene, and while we &s;how their dangerous tendency in &s;tates of a more modern date, we will exhibit an illu&s;trious example through what &s;cenes of danger, hard&s;hips and blood the determined &s;pirit of honor, and attachment to freedom will carry a people.</P>
<P>Previous to mentioning the &s;ituation of the <HI>united provinces,</HI> I mu&s;t remark how very &s;imilar their circum&s;tances were to ours. We &s;hall ever find it an unalterable maxim of princes, who in time of peace keep up a &s;tanding force, however they may call them the <HI>protectors of law,</HI> the end is <HI>to &s;ubvert</HI> tho&s;e laws and render the con&s;titution u&s;ele&s;s. Such was the mode of conduct of <HI>Phillip
<PB N="8" REF="015725_0007_0F9B2AB0D5FE3020">the &s;econd</HI> of Spain, to the low countries, and &s;uch the procedure of a &s;imilar character, <HI>George the third,</HI> of Britain, influenced by as de&s;picable a min&s;try. The former, as &s;ir William Temple ob&s;erves, "thinking it not agreeing with his greatne&s;s," (an army being now in the bowels of their country) "to con&s;i|der their di&s;contents, or be limited by their ancient forms of government," pro|ceeds to de&s;pi&s;e the one and overturn the other. New courts judicatory were appointed, new offices e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>depending ab&s;olutely on the king.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Wil. Temple's Ob&s;ervations on the United Provinces, Pag. 21, 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence?&mdash;could it be &s;uppo&s;ed a generous people would &s;it down tamely, and ki&s;s the rod that la&s;h'd them? a different mode of con|duct en&s;ued. The duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was &s;ent with a powerful army, the very forcible plea of tyrants, and the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelties were committed. Here let humanity &s;pread her veil, nor let the tender brea&s;t heave with angui&s;h at &s;uch &s;cenes. But &s;hocking as they are, they flow as naturally from this cur|&s;ed engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, as beams of light from the &s;un. For as the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible writer ob&s;erves, <Q>So great antipathy ever appears between citizens and &s;oldiers; while one <HI>pretends to be &s;afe</HI> under laws, which the other pretends <HI>&s;hall be &s;ubject</HI> to his &s;word and his will.</Q></P>
<P>But terrible as the many executions of their mo&s;t illu&s;trious patriots appear'd to them, while the land was drench'd in its riche&s;t blood;&mdash;however affecting the &s;ight of confi&s;cations, impri&s;onments, and the numberle&s;s cruelties that at|tended them, they were not daunted. That God who hateth oppre&s;&s;ion, and delighteth in the happine&s;s of his creation, in&s;pired them with &s;entiments, that carried them through innumerable hard&s;hips, till after having expended immen&s;e trea&s;ures and blood for better than three&s;core years they laid the foun|dation of a rich, free and flouri&s;hing people: Providence hereby giving an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on to po&s;terity in every age, who are contending for all that is dear and &s;acred, to pur&s;ue the glorious object undaunted; knowing that as liberty is a plant tran&s;planted from the gardens of heaven, its divine parent will &s;till cheri&s;h it, and in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition it will flouri&s;h, it will live forever.</P>
<P>Such, my friends, have been the methods u&s;ed by enterpri&s;ing men, in former ages, to carry into effect their ambitious de&s;igns, and found their great|ne&s;s on the ruins of their country. But in our day, the&s;e mea&s;ures have be|come &s;y&s;tematical. They are in fact part of the con&s;titution. To take a view of the different powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> and compare them with the &s;tate of ancient republics, under great and wi&s;e legi&s;lators, who &s;eem'd to be rai&s;ed up for the benefit of the age they lived in, and the admiration of po&s;terity, we mu&s;t drop the tear of &s;en&s;ibility at the contra&s;t. Where is the kingdom that does not groan under the calamities of military tyranny?&mdash;let us pau&s;e a while on the mo&s;t eminent of them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015725_0008_0F9B2AB232E43A90">
In the large Empire of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the effects are glaring. Even the &s;hadow of Liberty has evani&s;hed. Of &s;o great importance is the Military, that a re|cruiting Officer can go through their Villages, and pitch upon the able&s;t of the Inhabitants as he would chu&s;e his Cattle. And even a Father has been im|pri&s;oned in his own hou&s;e, for the e&s;cape of a Child, while by order of the Officer, his own Sons have been his goalers. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Guthrie's Grammar.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps there is no Nation in any part of the world, more happy than <HI>France,</HI> in every luxury of life. But amid this profu&s;ion of plenty, the Farmer exhibits the mo&s;t wretched &s;pectacle in nature. Supported by the gleanings of the field, the fruits of his labor go to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Soldiery. Thus di&s;pirited and depre&s;&s;ed, he contents him&s;elf with the refuge of his ground, while after his greate&s;t exertions, another will reap the fruits of his hone&s;t indu&s;try. The mo&s;t obdurate brea&s;t mu&s;t melt at &s;uch &s;cenes, and execrate the effects of &s;tanding Armies.</P>
<P>Look into the &s;ituation of <HI>Poland.</HI> Under the direction of that great Man, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John Sobieslci.</NOTE> famous for his victories again&s;t the Turks, they were brave and virtuous, and proved the bulwark of Chri&s;tendom. But under the Saxon line, this &s;pirit, not &s;uiting their plan of government, was awed by Electoral troops, and totally de|cayed. The con&s;equences are now &s;everely experienced by them, and while in this depre&s;&s;ed State they are an object of de&s;ire to <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> their Country is a &s;cene of blood&s;hed and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to mention <HI>England,</HI> or the idle farce of an annual Act of Par|liament, for the &s;upport of &s;tanding Troops, which is nothing but an in&s;ult on the &s;en&s;e of that Nation. The more virtuous among them, if the flame of liberty has not entirely expired, ea&s;ily &s;ee through the gui&s;e, and in the death of <HI>Allen</HI> and others, wantonly butchered by a mercenary Soldiery, can too clearly read the fate of them&s;elves and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The melancholy part of this &s;ubject mu&s;t give pain to every humane brea&s;t. This is natural. But the&s;e &s;cenes more directly affect other nations; and how|ever we may pity the unhappy &s;ufferers, there is a kind of plea&s;ure we feel that we our&s;elves are not immediately intere&s;ted. And would to God, it had ever remained &s;o. O my Country! with what heart-felt &s;atisfaction, &s;hould I re|joice, if oppre&s;&s;ion had never &s;tretched her baleful wings to this once happy clime! That that liberty which an illu&s;trious &s;et of Men, of whom the world was not worthy, purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate, might have de&s;cended unimpaired to late&s;t po&s;terity. But is this the ca&s;e? Has this &s;courge of mankind, &s;tand|ing
<PB N="10" REF="015725_0009_0F9B2AB33A9CD648">Armies, never interrupted our pro&s;perity?&mdash;If &s;o, why is this De&s;k hung with the &s;able covering of Death! Why am I &s;urrounded by &s;o many of my fellow-citizens, who li&s;ten to the tale of woe! Yes, my Countrymen, we our|&s;elves are deeply intere&s;ted; and this &s;ame engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, which has thrown mighty Republics from their foundations, has attempted and &s;till con|tinues to &s;pread the &s;ame horrid con&s;equences in America. And in its u&s;ual mode of conduct, has been attended with every &s;pecies of cruelty, &s;ome of them unheard of before; but which your firmne&s;s, under God, has hitherto, and I pray ever may &s;urmount.</P>
<P>The &s;hocking &s;cene of that dreadful night, the fatal effects of which we are &s;till weeping over, is beyond de&s;cription. No one perhaps, if it is taken in every view, that was not a &s;pectator, can conceive it. When I con&s;ider the many in&s;ults, abu&s;es and violences, this unhappy Town was expo&s;ed to for months previous to this melancholy tragedy&mdash;and when the tumult of contrary pa&s;&s;ions was thus naturally excited, to &s;ee a brutal &s;oldiery, &s;cattering promi&s;cuous death through a defencele&s;s unarmed multitude, till yonder &s;treet was crim|&s;oned with the blood of its Citizens, while a tender Mother, frantic with grief, pours forth the angui&s;h of her heart over a beloved &s;on, now incapable of any returns of gratitude, all this exhibits a &s;cene, which the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed heart may painfully feel, but which the tongue cannot expre&s;s. Let the brea&s;t then &s;till continue to beat. The&s;e, my friends, are virtuous, generous feelings, and do honor to humanity. May we ever retain them. May this In&s;titution, &s;acred to the memory of our murdered Brethren, be ever carefully pre&s;erved. Yes, ye injured Shades! We will &s;till weep over you, and if any thing can be more &s;oothing, WE WILL REVENGE YOU.</P>
<P>This glaring &s;pecimen of cruelty rou&s;ed the Citizens, and in convincing colors di&s;played the effects of &s;tanding Armies in time of peace. But however our exertions were then &s;ucce&s;sful, however the &s;torm &s;ub&s;ided, it was but tem|porary. While the Scales of Ju&s;tice were held in pal&s;ied hands, and the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities were the highe&s;t merit, an additional force only was nece&s;|&s;ary. That arriving, the ma&s;k was thrown off, and a &s;till greater &s;cene of car|nage and de&s;truction, opened in our adjacent villages.</P>
<P>But &s;uch proceedings, however alarming at that period, were &s;oon lo&s;t in more dreadful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing operations. The Heights of Charle&s;town too awfully convinced us of the melancholly truth, and po&s;terity, while with tears of compa&s;&s;ion, they ponder the tran&s;actions of that day, mu&s;t execrate the cau&s;es which produced them. In any &s;ituation, the relicts of &s;laughtered Citizens are objects of pity, and the &s;ympathizing &s;pectator will ever drop a tear over them. But there may be in&s;tances, when the le&s;&s;er &s;treams of affection, are ab&s;orbed in a &s;till greater &s;ea of woe. Such are the &s;entiments that mu&s;t &s;trike every
<PB N="11" REF="015725_0010_0F9B2AB3C0405C90">brea&s;t, when we reflect, ILLUSTRIOUS WARREN! on thy death&mdash;A death, which whole hecatombs of &s;laughtered enemies, &s;trowed around thy Corp&s;e, can never repay. Here, Ye minions of power! Ye who are dead to the calls of honor and public virtue, are willing to wade to Station, through the blood of your Brethren, here behold a Spectacle that mu&s;t harrow your inmo&s;t &s;oul. You, my Countrymen, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, have attentively li&s;tened, while, like us, he was weeping over the unhappy fate of others. You have kindled into rage, while he has &s;et before you the dangerous nature and con&s;e|quences of &s;tanding Armies, and prophetically pointed out to you &s;till greater events. How affecting! That he who could lament the fate of others, mu&s;t be him&s;elf deplored;&mdash;and that he, who could &s;o feelingly paint the effects of this horrid mea&s;ure, mu&s;t him&s;elf fall one of the fir&s;t &s;acrifices to it!</P>
<P>But it is not &s;ufficient to drop a tran&s;ient tear to the memory of departed Heroes, or to pay an Eulogy to their characters. The happine&s;s of &s;uch Men, who, after having expired in the arms of Liberty and Virtue, are now &s;haring the highe&s;t degree of felicity, cannot be increa&s;ed by our prai&s;es: No, my friends, the be&s;t way to expre&s;s our affection for &s;uch great and good Men, is to rou&s;e and revenge them. To hurl &s;till fiercer bolts of vengeance on an in|human Soldiery, who in&s;tead of affording the la&s;t honors, &s;acred to the dead, and which a generous Enemy will ever regard,&mdash;after grinning with helli&s;h plea&s;ure on the mangled Corp&s;e, which alive could &s;trike terror into their bolde&s;t heart, lodged it in a promi&s;cuous grave; that &s;ince they could not prevent his name and reputation being immortal, his Remains might be hid forever.&mdash;O Britain! Thou ha&s;t, and &s;hall &s;till weep tears of blood for this!</P>
<P>Are not &s;uch In&s;tances, my Countrymen, very convincing proofs of the fatal effects of &s;tanding Armies, in time of peace. In &s;uch a period they originated, and from the fifth of March 1770, through every degree of violence and bar|barity, to the pre&s;ent day, it is but one connected &s;cene.</P>
<P>After &s;uch exhibitions of cruelty and carnage, what can we &s;uppo&s;e too bru|tal, too infamous for &s;uch an army? Can we wonder to &s;ee our hou&s;es in flames? Our altars ra&s;ed to the ground, or converted to a much more horrid u&s;e, than the Jewi&s;h temple? It po&s;&s;ible they have even exceeded; and the armies of Britain &s;eem to be held up as a &s;tanding evidence, how far the &s;pirit of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion can operate.</P>
<P>We &s;hudder when the faithful page of hi&s;tory opens to our view the conduct of armies, flu&s;h'd with victories, &s;acking towns, burning villages, and perpetrating murders, with all the other dreadful concomitants. But if we look into the conduct of the Briti&s;h army in the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> and &s;ome part of the State of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="015725_0011_0F9B2AB47A8D8C38">we &s;hall find in&s;tances of all the&s;e crimes, and perhaps in &s;ome places in&s;tances even beyond them. To &s;ee the third City in a neighbouring State, wantonly con&s;umed by an enemy, who not having &s;pirit or ability, to meet us in the field, de&s;cend to the&s;e little mean methods of exciting error&mdash;To &s;ee the ravages in the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> and the garden of America that wantonly defaced,&mdash;Does not the blood beat high!&mdash;Do we not pre&s;s forward to exterminate &s;uch Barbarians from the face of the earth!&mdash;But to mention &s;till greater &s;cenes of cruelty&mdash;Does not the ear tingle, when it hears the &s;hrieks of helple&s;s Virgins, dreadful victims to lu&s;t and barbarity; while the grey hairs and expre&s;|&s;ive groans of an aged parent, witne&s;s to his daughter's &s;hame, plead in vain. Can any thing &s;well this complicated &s;cene of woe? It <HI>can</HI> receive addition. The&s;e mon&s;ters exceed even the mo&s;t barbarous nations. With them the a&s;hes of the dead have ever been &s;acred. But under the patronage of a Briti&s;h Ty|rant and his General, &s;ouffing the tainted gale, they have ran&s;acked the &s;ilent repo&s;itories, and the remains of one that was once amiable and captivating, flung about as food for the birds of the air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Delauncey's Form.</NOTE> O God where is thy vengeance! O Virtue, Honor, Religion, Humanity, where, where are ye fled!</P>
<P>The&s;e, my Countrymen, are not the flights of fancy, not the dictates of ima|gination. They are &s;olid, though very affecting realities. Can we then wi&s;h a re-union with &s;uch a people? Can we ever familiarly &s;hake hands with a nation, who leaping every barrier, are thus wantonly &s;porting with our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and bathing them&s;elves in the blood of our countrymen? May America never re|tain &s;uch mean da&s;tardly &s;entiments! For my own part, if I may be indulged, I would intreat, I would conjure, every one, who as a parent feels for the welfare of his po&s;terity, to imitate the example of the renowned Carthagenian.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> about nine years old, was &s;oothing with childi&s;h care&s;&s;es his Father Hamil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> to take him along with him to Spain, whither, after fini&s;hing the war in Africa, be war now about to tran&s;port his troops. and was &s;acrificing for &s;ucce&s;s in that expedi|tion, he was led by his Father to the altar, and with his hand on the victim, was bound by this &s;olemn oath, <Q>That as &s;oon as he &s;hould have it in his power he would declare him&s;elf an enemy to the Roman People.</Q> <HI>Livy,</HI> b. 21. ch. 1.</NOTE> Lead your &s;ons, ye fathers, not to the altar of Pagani&s;m, and under the tutelage of &s;ome unknown Deity, but to the &s;acred altar of Freedom; and while the guar|dian God of America is witne&s;s to the &s;olemn obligation, MAKE THEM SWEAR that they never will be friends to a Power, who are thus &s;acrificing their deare&s;t privileges.

No one, I think, can &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e thoughts proceed from rage or pa&s;&s;ion. They are the cool dictates of my heart. I love my Country; her di&s;tre&s;&s;es af|fect me; nor from this moment do I ever wi&s;h a reconciliation with a Power, who&s;e pro&s;perity mu&s;t be founded on my utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I have now, my Countrymen, endeavor'd to exhibit the fatal effects of &s;tanding armies in time of peace; not from ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, but as they exi&s;t in fact, and now prevail in our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed land. Here I would remark, that it is &s;tanding armies in <HI>time of peace,</HI> and the <HI>con&s;equences</HI> thence re&s;ulting, that we are now deprecating. Armies in defence of our Country, unju&s;tly invaded, are nece&s;&s;ary, and in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e ju&s;tifiable. We, my friends, attacked by an arbritary tyrant, under the &s;anction of a force, the effects of which, we have attempted to illu&s;trate, have been obliged to make the la&s;t &s;olemn appeal. And I cannot but feel a plea&s;ing kind of tran&s;port, when I &s;ee America, un|daunted by the many trying &s;cenes, that have attended her, &s;till baffling the efforts of the mo&s;t formidable power in Europe, and exhibiting an in&s;tance, unknown in hi&s;tory. To &s;ee an army of veterans, who had fought and con|quered in different quarters of the globe&mdash;headed by a General tutor'd in the field of War, illu&s;trious by former victories, and flu&s;h'd with repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es, threatning, with all the pomp of expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;pread havock, de&s;olation and ruin around him; to &s;ee &s;uch a Soldiery and &s;uch a General, yielding to an hardy race of men, new to the field of war; while on the one hand it exalts the character of the latter, convincingly proves the folly of tho&s;e, who, under pretence of having a body of troops, bred to war, and ever ready for action, adopt this dangerous &s;y&s;tem, in &s;ubver&s;ion of every principle of lawful govern|ment. Here, if after having depictured &s;cenes of &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a nature, it may not appear too de&s;cending, I could not forbear &s;miling at the Briti&s;h General and his Troops, who not willing to reflect on their pre&s;ent humiliating condition, affect the air of arrogant &s;uperiority. But Americans have learnt them, that Men, fighting on the principles of Freedom and Honor, de&s;pi&s;e the examples that have been &s;et them by an Enemy;&mdash;and though, in the field, they can brave every danger in defence of tho&s;e principles, to a vanqui&s;hed enemy they know how to be generous:&mdash;But that this is a genero&s;ity not weak and unmeaning, but found|ed on ju&s;t &s;entiments, and if wantonly preformed upon, will never interfere with that national ju&s;tice, which ever ought, and lately has been properly exerted.</P>
<P>But while, with the warme&s;t gratitude to Heaven, we view our late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and are at a lo&s;s to expre&s;s our acknowledgment to the ILLUSTRIOUS HERO, who was the in&s;trument, and who&s;e Name, to remote&s;t ages, will be ever dear to the&s;e New-England States, let us not forget our &s;ituation. There is an Army, and a very powerful one, &s;till exi&s;ting in the Heart of America. Me|thinks the Reputation of pa&s;t Succe&s;&s;es &s;hould animate every inhabitant of Ame|rica to fly to Arms; and by one general Exertion utterly expel this la&s;t, this only
<PB N="14" REF="015725_0013_0F9B2AB798F35C10">remaining power of Great Britain on the Continent. Ye, to whom the &s;acred, the important Sy&s;tem of Government is committed&mdash;Ye Men of Sen&s;e and Virtue&mdash;Ye Patriots, who feel an affection for your Country and Po&s;terity, let me conjure you to &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity, happier than we could ever have expected, and which once omitted may never be again in our power.</P>
<P>I would not pretend to in&s;inuate, that this is the <HI>only</HI> point which ought to be under <HI>immediate</HI> con&s;ideration, by a wi&s;e People or their <HI>Delegates.</HI> But this I will venture to affirm, that unle&s;s this is the <HI>governing &s;entiment,</HI> in every deliberation, every other thing is &s;uperfluous. Let us then ri&s;e &s;uperior to every private local attachment. As we are embarked on one broad bottom of univer&s;al Freedom, let us attend to this mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion; an occa&s;ion providentially offered for future Security and Happine&s;s, If a royal army, tho' weak in its number, can thus in&s;ult us unpuni&s;hed, the mo&s;t &s;lender imagi|nation can ea&s;ily fore&s;ee what mu&s;t be the effects of a &s;till greater force. I wi&s;h that the pre&s;ent generation, I wi&s;h that po&s;terity may not feelingly reproach our inactivity.</P>
<P>Shall the frequent Calls of our EXALTED GENERAL, who &s;eems to have been rai&s;ed up by Heaven, to &s;how to what an height Humanity may &s;oar; who generou&s;ly &s;acrificing affluence and dome&s;tic ca&s;e, wi&s;hes to &s;hare with you in every danger and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hall his frequent calls be in vain?&mdash;Remember, my Countrymen, the eyes of the Good and Great, in every Clime, are upon the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. Liberty, di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;cenes of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, has le&s;t her ancient altars, and is now hovering to fix her la&s;t re&s;idence in America. Our exertions have hitherto been great and &s;ucce&s;sful. Let not the a&s;hes of WARREN, MONTGOMERY, and the illu&s;trious Roll of Heroes who died for Freedom, reproach our inactivity and want of &s;pirit, in not <HI>compleating</HI> this grand Super&s;tructure; the Pillars of which have been cemented with the riche&s;t Blood of America. May that &s;ame Ardor, which has rendered America famous, &s;till continue, and looking forward to tho&s;e happy days of Liberty and Peace, which, our Po&s;terity &s;hall enjoy, let us exult at the thought, that future Gene|rations, while they reap the glorious Fruits of our Struggles, will ri&s;e up and call us Ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
