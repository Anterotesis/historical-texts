<HEAD>LETTERS ON APPRECIATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>NUMBER I.</HEAD>
<P>TO meddle with the &s;ubject of the Currency was long deemed a matter of the highe&s;t imprudence; and tho' all &s;aw and felt its decline, few had the hardine&s;s publicly to declare it. But the depreciation became, at length, an object of &s;uch magnitude, and was &s;o intimately connected with every movement, both political and military, that eve|ry eye became familiarized to it. The laws acknowledged it, and the news-papers, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive e&s;&s;ays, proclaimed it aloud. Various have been the &s;chemes for remedying the evil; and appreciation, appreciation, has been the cry from one end of the Continent to the other. To combat the general voice, may be thought to &s;avour of either folly or vanity. But as no injury can now happen to the public, from even torturing the &s;ubject into every &s;hape, I am willing to ri&s;que the im|putation; and venture on the ocean of finance with my little bark. An ocean, much of which remains unexplored, and in which fog banks and i&s;lands of ice are often mi&s;taken for land. If I peri&s;h with my little vi&s;ionary crew by the falling of &s;ome mighty projecting promontory, future voyages mu&s;t beware of my fate.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that in the &s;undry calcu|lations which I may take occa&s;ion to exhibit, I &s;hall gene|rally make u&s;e of whole numbers; as the nature of the &s;ub|ject precludes accuracy.</P>
<P>BY the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s in January, 1779, it appears they had emitted 123 millions of dollars. And in September following, in their circular letter, they &s;tate the amount ex|pended to be about 160 millions; and then propo&s;ed conti|nuing the emi&s;&s;ions till they &s;hould reach 200 millions, ex|clu&s;ive of 33 millions borrowed on intere&s;t. I pre&s;ume the &s;aid 200 millions are now compleated; for if in eight months (viz. from January to September) the expences were 37 mil|lions, when depreciation was on the general average 15 1-2
<PB N="2" REF="016820_0002_0F9E803CE1CF9038">
for 1, the remaining four months would undoubtedly con|&s;ume 40 millions, becau&s;e the average depreciation &s;ince September has been 35 1-2 for 1.</P>
<P>DURING the two fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ions, of 3 millions each, the money I believe continued at par, no actual diminution of value having taken place. How the depreciation has &s;ince gone on, may be &s;een by a table I &s;hall &s;ubjoin to this letter, taking gold for the &s;tandard; which, by the by, has ever been behind every other commodity in advance of price. As we have no account of the quantities of all the &s;everal emi&s;|&s;ions, or the dates at which they were actually i&s;&s;ued, it is in the brea&s;t of Congre&s;s alone, to determine with preci&s;ion, how far the depreciation has kept pace with the quantity, and from thence in &s;ome mea&s;ure to a&s;certain, whether the quantity alone, or &s;ome other concomitant cau&s;es, have pro|duced the effect. Was I to judge from mere conjectural ap|pearances, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the value of money has been principally affected by its relative quantity, when compared with the quantity of commodities for &s;ale. For in&s;tance, if 10 millions of dollars, at 7<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 each, were &s;ufficient for a me|dium of trade, when we had 40 millions of &s;aleables, and we &s;hould at any time have 200 millions of dollars, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e money would be depreciated as 20 to 1, becau&s;e, not being of intrin&s;ic value, or capable of exportation, there would be 20 times the number of bidders for every article on &s;ale (for money is in fact the buyer or bidder) and of cour&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of money could as well afford to give 20 prices for an article, as they could formerly to give <HI>one</HI> price. But if the quantity of &s;aleables &s;hould be reduced to one half, or 20 millions, I &s;hould then &s;ay that the depreciation was ac|tually 40 for 1; becau&s;e there was 40 times as much money as was nece&s;&s;ary for a medium. This I pre&s;ume is plain rea|&s;oning. But to come nearer to the matter of fact, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve that, from the be&s;t information I have been able to col|lect, the current money of America formerly never exceeded 16 millions of dollars, when the value of merchandize might be e&s;timated at about 45 millions.</P>
<P>I fancy it will be readily allowed, that we have not at pre&s;ent above one fourth part of the quantity of &s;aleables which we had formerly, con&s;equently not much above 11 millions in value. Then, if 16 millions of money conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of 45 millions of &s;aleables, How much is nece&s;&s;ary to nego|ciate 11 millions? The an&s;wer is, About 4 millions. And
<PB N="3" REF="016820_0003_0F9E803DB4DF37A0">
this proportion of money will be deemed very &s;ufficient, if we recollect, that 6 millions of running ca&s;h &s;erved the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of England in Sir William Petty's time, when the &s;aleables amounted to 42 millions and a half. Now as we have of Continental money about 200 millions, at a time when 4 millions would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, it is evident there is fifty times as much as is nece&s;&s;ary, and the money is in fact depreciated to fifty for one. I do not bring land into the ac|count of &s;aleables, as the amount would be too uncertain to at|tempt; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the local emi&s;&s;ions of the &s;everal States, together with the value of Loan-Office money i&s;&s;ued under the denomination of Certificates, may be deemed fully to counterbalance any allowance for the &s;ale of real e&s;tates; e&s;pecially when we reflect, that very con&s;iderable loans have been made &s;ince the 33 millions mentioned, in September.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that I am obliged to a&s;&s;ume my pre|mi&s;es, as no certain data can be formed, yet I conceive I am not much be&s;ide the mark; for if we rea&s;on back from effects to cau&s;es, we &s;hall find, that on an average the prices of &s;ale|ables are <HI>more</HI> than 50 for 1, and thence di&s;cover the medium to be 50 times more than is wanted. And I am the more con|vinced of the truth of this conjecture from the late prices of goods; which have in &s;ome mea&s;ure become &s;tationary or fixed. For though the quantity of money has been daily en|crea&s;ing, yet the quantity of goods, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, crouded in upon us, has in &s;ome mea&s;ure counterbalanced the quantity of money; whereby a kind of equilibrium hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and trade has fairly regulated it&s;elf. The merchants endeavoured to advance the prices, but the money on hand was not &s;ufficient to bear it; and it is ju&s;t now, relatively, as &s;carce as when it pa&s;&s;ed equal to hard money. Should Congre&s;s continue &s;triking at the rate of 10 millions a month, and 10 millions pre&s;ent value of goods &s;hould be imported in each month, I think I might venture to a&s;&s;ert, that no further real depreciation could take place. As to any more capricious turns, they could not be durable. The ge|neral equilibrium between the quantity of goods, and the quantity of money would &s;oon be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>THEN taking for granted, that the real depreciation is fifty for one, the grand que&s;tion ari&s;es, "What is to be done?" Some cry, &s;top the pre&s;s, and rai&s;e by taxes and loans &s;ufficient for the exigencies of government; &s;ome are for a &s;udden appreciation to the rate of twenty for one; &s;ome

for a foreign loan; and others for calling in the whole mo|ney, and re-i&s;&s;uing about one &s;ixth part, which, &s;ay they, will be as valuable as the whole; and the remaining 5 6th to be funded, and carry an intere&s;t. The&s;e &s;everal modes re&s;emble the pre&s;criptions of anxious friends, &s;tanding round a &s;ick bed&mdash;Some would bleed&mdash;&s;ome phy&s;ic&mdash;one is for poultices, another for a bath of bitter herbs, whil&s;t poor dame nature is labouring ince&s;&s;antly to throw off the di&s;or|der by her own efforts, and would often &s;ucceed, if not in|terrupted by the ignorance of quacks. That the money has depreciated, we well know; and many have fatally felt its effects; but tho&s;e partial evils I pre&s;ume are pretty generally at an end. All old contracts are either &s;ettled or the prof|fered payments ab&s;olutely rejected; for he who can bear to lo&s;e 19<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 in the pound, will not be ruined by the other &s;ix pence. Let the debtor pay it into the Trea&s;ury, and the Laws &s;upport him as long as con&s;cience will bear it. Pre|&s;ent dealings are for ready money&mdash;not a moment's credit is allowed&mdash;the ca&s;h is paid, or the bargain void.</P>
<P><HI>"Stop the pre&s;&s;es"</HI>&mdash;ea&s;ily &s;aid&mdash;But how are the current expences to be &s;upplied?&mdash;<HI>"Rai&s;e taxes"</HI>&mdash;Every State on the Continent, is at it as hard as they can drive, and law after law has been pa&s;&s;ed for &s;upplying the quotas called for by Congre&s;s. In November 1777, five millions were re|quired, in 1779 fifteen millions and forty-five millions. Yet I believe not one will a&s;&s;ert, that even one fourth part of the whole is paid into the Trea&s;ury. In Sep|tember la&s;t, they tell us, no more than three millions had been received. To expect that a country can be brought to pay taxes, voluntarily, to &s;upport the whole demands of the year, in the mid&s;t of an expen&s;ive war, is as ab&s;urd, as to &s;uppo&s;e the rent of a hou&s;e will in one year pay for the building of it; nothing but an anticipation of the taxes can effect it. A young country, like America, can by no means be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uch an overplus of riches as to furni&s;h the &s;um wanted. In England they have long been com|pelled to borrow, in time of war, and the accumulating in|tere&s;t has nearly ruined the nation; they can now &s;carce le|vy taxes &s;ufficient to pay the intere&s;t; for during the whole interval of the la&s;t peace, they have not, I think, paid four millions into the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>"BORROW money then&mdash;at home&mdash;of foreigners&mdash;any where&mdash;rather than have fre&s;h emi&s;&s;ions."&mdash;What borrow

on intere&s;t, when you may have it without!&mdash;Send your re&s;ources to foreign Courts when you may keep them at home!&mdash; I would a&s;k, what is the difference between &s;triking a million of Bills of 50 dollars each, and i&s;&s;uing Loan Of|fice Certificates for the &s;ame amount in notes of 500 dollars each? With re&s;pect to the quantity of paper, there is none; for Certificates are now as liable to circulation, as the money it&s;elf. We are not to conclude that the Certificates will re|main more dormant than the money did. He who puts money into the Loan-Office, may be pre&s;umed to have no immediate u&s;e for it; and that it was innocently re&s;ting in his che&s;t, without ru&s;hing into circulation to encrea&s;e the &s;um current; and whenever it becomes convenient to make a purcha&s;e he would either bring out the ca&s;h or the Certi|ficate. Therefore to pay an intere&s;t of 6 per cent for money received at the Loan Office, is in my humble opinion to in|volve the country in a la&s;ting tax, purely for the benefit of monied men. A tax which every man of &s;mall capital, ar|ti&s;an and labourer, mu&s;t annually contribute to rai&s;e, with|out the lea&s;t benefit to them&s;elves. From the fir&s;t moment a Loan-Office was projected, I conceived it an error in po|litics, and it has brought on the country the great evil of a contrariety of intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee a great depreciation has happened of near 50 for 1, and every man who at the fir&s;t paid 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> into the Loan-Office, has in fact &s;unk his &s;tock to 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and &s;o in propor|tion to the different dates at which they lent to the public; and many of the&s;e have been foreign lenders upon the credit and honour of the Continent. Now all the&s;e people have an intere&s;t different from the people at large, and mu&s;t be continually wi&s;hing for a re&s;toration of the value of the mo|ney; whil&s;t the re&s;t of the community who have gradually borne a &s;hare of the lo&s;s by depreciation from time to time, and have &s;ettled and &s;quared all their tran&s;actions conform|ably thereto, cannot have a wi&s;h to &s;ee the money return to its original value. All they have to de&s;ire is, that the value may remain where it is, or if it &s;till declines, that they may bear no more than their proportion of the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>IT may be a&s;ked what mode of &s;ettlement is to be adopted between government and the money lenders. Policy would an&s;wer <Q>emit as much fre&s;h money as will pay off the whole debt immediately,</Q> and ju&s;tice would add, <Q>let &s;uch an addition be made, as will amply reimbur&s;e the lenders,
<PB N="6" REF="016820_0006_0F9E803FD93E91F8">
e&s;timating the value of money at the time of &s;ub&s;cribing.</Q> Perhaps &s;ome medium between the two, might be proper; for as people at large have borne their &s;hare of the deprecia|tion, the&s;e &s;ub&s;cribers could not expect to &s;et down whole. I don't pretend to determine, what &s;uch medium &s;hould be. I only contend for the immediate di&s;&s;olution of the Loan-Office; for why &s;hould the Community be burthened with an addition of taxes, merely to pay an intere&s;t to monied men, for lending paper to government; when that very pa|per could be as well made without any other expence than &s;triking it; and the larger the&s;e bills the better; if a thou|&s;and dollars each, it might help to retard the circulation, and le&s;&s;en the charge of printing and &s;igning. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the whole of my rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject turns upon the a&s;&s;ertion, that Loan-Office Certificates are money to all intents and purpo&s;es, and operate in proportion to their quantity, equal to a like &s;um of Continental bills&mdash; if I am wrong my conclu&s;ions fall to the ground.</P>
<P>LOANS on intere&s;t in England are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e real gold is paid into the trea&s;ury by the &s;ub&s;cribers, but could their government manufacture that gold, as cheap as we can manufacture paper, will any man &s;uppo&s;e they would prefer taking it up on intere&s;t? &s;urely no; the habit we had long been accu&s;tomed to, of u&s;ing paper money, ren|dered it familiar to us; and no one was alarmed with the con&s;equences of an encrea&s;ing quantity, yet it is a debt to all intents and purpo&s;es; but being due to our&s;elves, the evil is not &s;o great as if Foreigners were our creditors. The expe|riment might prove dangerous to Great-Britain, &s;hould &s;he attempt to carry on a war with paper money, otherwi&s;e &s;he might pledge her funds for redeeming it and &s;ave the intere&s;t, but her complicated trade and connection with foreigners would thereby be involved in great perplexity. It will be &s;aid, that much of the circulating medium of Great-Britain is already paper: I grant it with this difference, that it is not legal tender, and a man can at any moment convert it into actual hard ca&s;h. But I have rather wandered from the point: I only mean to prove, that it is highly injurious to America in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, to have a Loan-Office. As to foreign Loans with a view to &s;erve the Currency, every ar|gument u&s;ed again&s;t Loans among&s;t our&s;elves, applies with equal force again&s;t them, with this important addition, that the intere&s;t would be an actual drain of the wealth of our
<PB N="7" REF="016820_0007_0F9E804303321D80">
country. In the former in&s;tance it would only drain people of moderate and &s;mall fortunes for the benefit of the rich; but in the latter both rich and poor would lo&s;e for ever the intere&s;t &s;o paid. How far Foreign Loans may be requi&s;ite to &s;upply the Continent with &s;uch Foreign nece&s;&s;aries, as we have not the means of paying for at pre&s;ent, is a con&s;idera|tion which does not come within the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert the table of depreciation the greater part of which I had from a trader, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s required his accounts to be kept in hard money, and agrees with accounts kept by &s;ome others with whom I have compared. And yet I am aware it cannot corre&s;pond with all, who may have kept &s;uch accounts, becau&s;e the rates of exchange, between different per&s;ons, have often varied on the &s;ame day; I on|ly mean to demon&s;trate the general gradual depreciation; and the table here produced, will come near enough to the truth, for the u&s;e I propo&s;e making of it in my next letter.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II.</HEAD>
<P>IF taxes will not &s;upply the pre&s;ent exigencies, and Loans, both dome&s;tic and foreign, are rejected; you &s;ay appreci|ate the money to 20 for 1 by acts of the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, and oblige the venders of goods and trade&s;men to charge their goods and work at that rate. Has not this mode been attempted three &s;everal times, and univer&s;ally failed? Did not general di&s;contents and murmurs prevail? Was not every artifice u&s;ed to elude the &s;cheme? Were not goods &s;ecreted? And did not one State take the advantage of the other, in either buying up from their neighbour, or refu&s;ing to have intercour&s;e with them? Did not Congre&s;s (aware of the evils it produced) recommend the di&s;continuing &s;uch regu|lations? And is it not probable the &s;ame inconveniences will &s;till ari&s;e? And after the people have been worrying and perplexing each other, will it not be likely to fall through? as trade carried on under re&s;traint will be for ever attempt|ing to break the fetters. But &s;hould &s;ucce&s;s attend the at|tempt, it would produce the very evil I would wi&s;h to avoid. An evil of the mo&s;t alarming nature; converting an <HI>imaginary</HI> into a <HI>real</HI> debt, and riveting on the Continent a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of taxes, which we &s;hould &s;carce ever be able to get clear of. Suppo&s;e we con&s;ider this &s;ubject a little more minutely. We will, for argument's &s;ake, allow of the de&s;ired appreciation in its utmo&s;t extent; that by &s;ome magical &s;troke the whole Continental money, calling it 200 millions, &s;hould become equal to gold and &s;ilver; that a Continental dollar would purcha&s;e as much as a hard dollar would; why truly we &s;hould &s;uddenly arrive at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of immen&s;e riches, provided we could export this &s;ame money as a commodity, and import, in lieu thereof, the production of other coun|tries; but as no one can expect this can happen, what is to be done with it? The exce&s;s of quantity is far beyond the value of &s;aleables; is the &s;urplus to be locked up? No, we will put it to intere&s;t with &s;uch as want: But this cannot be; for tho&s;e who are to be the borrowers, cannot find ma|terials to ve&s;t it in. What is next to be done with this &s;ur|plus? It appears to be a nominal not a real e&s;tate; it lies dormant by us, and nothing is to be bought with it, for the proportion in actual circulation an&s;wers every purpo&s;e.

that, in ca&s;e of another war, we may not have too great a re|dundance of it, by &s;triking afre&s;h, and again bring on our backs this mon&s;ter depreciation. But how &s;hall this &s;ame money be de&s;troyed, in &s;uch equal proportions, as to give general &s;atisfaction?&mdash;Very ea&s;ily, by taxes.&mdash;Agreed. We will now, if you plea&s;e begin to lay them, and try how long it will take to do the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Here is John Harrow, the farmer, for in&s;tance. He has a farm of 200 acres, and rai&s;es 400 bu&s;hels of wheat per an+num, which, at 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per bu&s;hel, the pre&s;ent price, is 8000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for which he &s;hall pay the old accu&s;tomed rate of 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 in the pound; his tax will then be 600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.&mdash;But &s;top, the money is appreciated. John Harrow cannot get above 8<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per bu&s;hel for his wheat, his 400 bu&s;hels will only amount to 160<ABBR>l.</ABBR> of con&s;equence his tax of 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 in the pound will yield no more than 12<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum; which is only one fiftieth part. Very pretty, truly! Why, then if this 200 mil|lions is to be made good money, we &s;hall take <HI>fifty years</HI> to pay off that portion of the debt, which would have been paid off in <HI>one year,</HI> if the money had not appreciated: That is, John Harrow, in&s;tead of &s;elling 30 bu&s;hels of wheat one year, at 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per bu&s;hel, to rai&s;e his 600<ABBR>l.</ABBR> he mu&s;t now &s;ell this &s;ame 30 bu&s;hels for 12<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and have the &s;ame to do every year for 49 years to come; which would in fact be a tax upon John Harrow of 1500 bu&s;hels, in&s;tead of 30; and all this for the honor of making our money good.</P>
<P>WE will now, if you plea&s;e, bring it upon a more general &s;cale: Penn&s;ylvania formerly rai&s;ed by an 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax about 25,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, at 7<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 the dollar. Now Penn&s;ylvania being deemed 1-8th of the Continent, we may &s;ay the whole Thirteen States would rai&s;e by a 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax about 200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which is &s;omewhat about half a million of dollars. Thus we find it would take only about 400 years to &s;ink the &s;aid 200 millions of dollars. But this &s;ame 400 years would carry us to &s;o di&s;tant a period, that few of the pre&s;ent generation could hope to &s;ee a &s;ettlement of the account; and great frauds might be committed by our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; to remedy which, &s;uppo&s;e, for the honor of the pre&s;ent race, we &s;hould annually pay the whole of our incomes, or 20<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in the pound, which will rai&s;e ju&s;t 13 times and 1-3; as much as the 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax would, and &s;o fini&s;h the job in about 30 years. In the mean time, we may go abroad upon our travels, whil&s;t our e&s;tates are out at nur&s;e, as the Engli&s;h phra&s;e is; and at the end of
<PB N="10" REF="016820_0010_0F9E80451D449590">
this quarter of a century we might return, and &s;pend the remainder of our lives in Peace and Plenty. But pray, who are to work your e&s;tates in your ab&s;ence?&mdash;A good re|mark&mdash; Why then, we mu&s;t 'een drudge on as &s;laves during the &s;aid 25 years, live on the hu&s;ks and &s;ell the grain, for the honor of appreciation.</P>
<P>YOU a&s;k next "how this enormous debt of 200 millions came upon us? Is it po&s;&s;ible we can have expended 50 mil. per annum hone&s;tly and fairly, or have there been frauds and embezzlements?" All very fairly: The quantity of money in|crea&s;ing daily beyond the medium nece&s;&s;ary for circulation, a gradual depreciation took place; every one having plenty of money to buy with, the &s;ellers advanced their prices, in proportion to the number of bidders, 'till at length they ro&s;e on an average to about 50 for 1. "And have the public expences been managed in this way?" Undoubtedly, all the late expenditures for the army, navy, &amp;c. have been on an average at that rate. Then, &s;urely, the different receivers, and all &s;ub&s;equent handlers of the money, who have made Con|gre&s;s pay 50 prices, ought not to have the &s;ame money made equal with gold; for, &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent money-holders would be enormous gainers, and the Con|tinent for 400 years to come mu&s;t feel its effects. Then you would have the money remain at its pre&s;ent value? Cer|tainly, if it can be kept there; but by no means carried back towards its former value.</P>
<P>BUT the depreciation will run on rapidly if we keep &s;trik|ing; for you intimate that the taxes we may expect to rai&s;e, will be but as a drop in the bucket.&mdash;Pray, what great public evil do you imagine has happened from the depre|ciation? &mdash;Oh! very great. Our money is good for nothing it will take an e&s;tate to go to market, every thing is &s;o high that common people can &s;carcely find money enough to pur|cha&s;e the nece&s;&s;aries of life, putting taxes out of the que&s;tion which taxes they &s;ay mu&s;t be rai&s;ed or we &s;hall be all ruined Suppo&s;e, I was to a&s;&s;ert in an&s;wer, that there is at pre&s;en no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for high government taxes, that the natural unavoidable tax of depreciation is the mo&s;t certain expeditious and equal tax that could be devi&s;ed. Upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which has lately exi&s;ted, every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of money has paid a tax for it, in proportion to the time he hold it.

Penn&s;ylvania have, in vain, attempted to levy, by obliging every per&s;on to di&s;clo&s;e, on oath, the &s;um in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I &s;ay, in vain; for I will venture to predict, that the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors will not find out one fifth part of the ca&s;h which is actually among&s;t us. But, depreciation is an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or that gets at every farthing, and baffles every attempt to deceive. To make my&s;elf better under&s;tood, I will &s;tate an account in double columns, viz. Continental and Hard money, at the different dates of depreciation; though it is to be noted, that I have no certain documents, as to <HI>time</HI> or <HI>quantity,</HI> and that I e&s;timate the depreciation by the price of gold, which has always been below every other commodity. It will &s;erve however to illu&s;trate my rea&s;oning.&mdash;When this account is examined, it will probably be thought very &s;urpri&s;ing, that the neat expences of 1779, when brought into gold, &s;hould fall &s;o much &s;hort of tho&s;e in the preceding years. It cannot well be accounted for, but by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the large &s;ums received at the Loan-Office have made up the deficiency; but of this we have no account later than September la&s;t. The only certain premi&s;es we can procede on, are; That two hundred millions of dollars have been i&s;&s;ued; that one hundred and twenty-three millions were expended Decem|ber 1778; that the remaining &s;eventy-&s;even millions were expended in the year 1779; and that the table of deprecia|tion, in the foregoing part of this paper, is a true &s;tate of the decline of the money, when compared with gold. Be the appearance what it may, the fact is, that at whatever dates the two hundred millions have been expended, the va|lue of money at tho&s;e dates mu&s;t be taken for the real &s;um expended; for though at one time it took &s;ix thou&s;and dol|lars to purcha&s;e a thou&s;and barrels of flour, and at another time two hundred thou&s;and dollars, the actual expence to the country is exactly the &s;ame; it is the article &s;upplied, and not the nominal &s;um paid, which con&s;titutes the real expenditure.</P>

<P>BY this &s;tate of the matter, the whole expences have amounted to 48 millions of hard dollars, 43 of which have been &s;unk in the time by depreciation. Now I would a&s;k the be&s;t financier among&s;t us, whether in four years he could have levied a tax of 43 millions of hard dollars, in a more equal or le&s;s expen&s;ive way? Here have been no com|mi&s;&s;ions to pay, no embezzlements, no public defaulters, and no appeals, except by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of old contracts, who have been ungenerou&s;ly and unju&s;tly paid off in current nominal value, under &s;anction of laws, which ought long ago to have been repealed.</P>
<P>I can &s;carcely think it po&s;&s;ible, that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee the money re&s;tored to its original value, have ever adverted &s;eriou&s;ly to the &s;ubject. We find, that Congre&s;s have ex|pended, in the la&s;t four months, 40 millions of dollars, be|&s;ides the &s;ums received at the Loan-Office. Now would any man, in his &s;en&s;es, wi&s;h to have the Continent at the expence of above 10 millions of hard dollars per month? Is he aware that at 4<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 &s;terling per dollar, it amounts to nine millions of &s;terling pounds for the &s;aid four months? A &s;um almo&s;t twice as large as Great-Britain expended in any four months of the la&s;t war. This would be extravagance in the extreme, and the more inexcu&s;able as the nature of the ca&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="016820_0013_0F9E8047A49032F0">
by no means requires it. Every man who now receives the money, e&s;timates it at the proper di&s;count. If he &s;ells a hou&s;e, a hor&s;e, or a piece of goods, he demands at lea&s;t for|ty prices for them, and in many articles va&s;tly more, &s;o as to have on an average near 50 prices; then, from what train of rea&s;oning are the&s;e money-holders to receive the value of a hard dollar, for every Continental dollar thus obtained, at the fiftieth part of its value? Should the war continue, emi&s;&s;ions of &s;ome &s;ort mu&s;t run on, and the money will ine|vitably &s;ink in value; and, politically &s;peaking, this would not be an evil, for it would &s;till operate as a gradual tax, affecting every individual in the community. Let us, for ar|gument &s;ake, &s;uppo&s;e that the war &s;hould la&s;t another year. The expences of that year added to the foregoing emi&s;&s;ions would probably &s;tand, as follows:</P>

This &s;um I have taken as the expenditure of every month, and have gradually va|ried the exchange, exactly in proportion to the quantity en|crea&s;ed, beyond the &s;ums required for a medium; from whence it followed, that as the rate of exchange advanced, a proportionable addition to the monthly emi&s;&s;ion became nece&s;&s;ary; and though the emi&s;&s;ions have amounted in this e&s;timate to three hundred fifty-nine millions of dollars, we find depreciation has &s;till been our faithful friend, and kept us from &s;inking under the burthen. We find, notwith&s;tanding the enormous &s;ound, that the &s;um of 5 1-4 millions of hard dollars would redeem them all, without any per&s;on having a right to complain; for, having received the money from time to time at the depreciated rate, no one could rea&s;onably ob|ject to reducing them to that real value.</P>
<P>WHEN the war is over, I &s;hould have no objection to a foreign loan, to pay off the whole currency at the rate then exi&s;ting, which no man could be di&s;plea&s;ed with, and great confu&s;ions might be avoided. We &s;hould then know what was our real debt, and apply our&s;elves in good earne&s;t to &s;ink both principal and intere&s;t as fa&s;t as the country could bear it. But funding paper money with paper money, and paying an intere&s;t for what we may have without, is an im|po&s;ition on the middle and poorer cla&s;s of people, who will have nothing to lend, but will be for ever paying taxes for intere&s;t money received by the rich. I am therefore aver&s;e to a Loan-Office of any kind at the pre&s;ent; to enormous taxes; and by all means object to every &s;cheme tending to appreciation.</P>

<P>FROM the calculations which have been exhibited, it appears, that the <HI>real debt</HI> of America, at the end of the year 1780, will probably amount to no more than five mil|lions and a quarter of hard dollars, exclu&s;ive of Loan-Office Certificates; which &s;um will be &s;unk by an 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax in 10 years. This is evident from the principles we have already a&s;&s;umed, viz. that Penn&s;ylvania is e&s;timated at an eighth of the Continent, and rai&s;es by an 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax 25,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.
<PB N="15" REF="016820_0015_0F9E804AE5057E48">
But, &s;hould the de&s;ired appreciation &s;uccede, and the nomi|nal &s;um, of 359 1-4 millions of dollars, become equal to its declared value, it would require near 700 years to &s;ink the whole. It may probably be &s;aid, that a &s;udden appreciation is not intended, and therefore the rea&s;oning, here urged, will not apply; to which I an&s;wer, that the evil of appreciation will be felt in exact proportion to its retrograde motion. If the general appreciation &s;hould average 30 for 1 in any given time, accounting back from the pre&s;ent, and then remain fixed, I &s;hould &s;ay, that in&s;tead of 400 years tax, as &s;uppo&s;ed in my former numbers, it would only take 100 years. If it was reduced to 20 for 1, it would take 200 years, if reduced to 10 for 1,300 years. Any appreciation whatever will ope|rate again&s;t the payment of the debts; it would produce an effect to which the whole circle of politics could not produce a parallel, viz. a government refunding to its inhabitants the taxes they have been paying; for we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that depre|ciation is an actual tax, and that appreciation is an actual refund. For in&s;tance: John Harrow, in June, 1779, when exchange was 20 for 1, &s;old a pair of oxen for 200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> with which &s;um he could have bought two pieces of linen, of 25 yards each, at 4<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per yard, which formerly &s;old at 4<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per yard. But John Harrow neglecting to make the purcha&s;e till December, when exchange was 40 for 1, he could buy with the produce of his two oxen no more than one piece of linen, becau&s;e the price had ri&s;en to 8<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per yard; then, &s;urely, it fol|lows that John Harrow has paid a tax amounting to the va|lue of one ox. On the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e John Harrow kept his money till this day, and a paper dollar &s;hould pa&s;s equal to a &s;ilver dollar, his 200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> would bring him 40 pieces of linen, by which he would gain 38 pieces. But how think you is the apparent gain to be provided for? Is it not by John Harrow, and every other farmer and inhabitant, in|volving them&s;elves either in a mon&s;trous immediate tax, or a duration of moderate taxes on them and their heirs, to the end of the world, for aught we know.</P>
<P>NOR will the effects of appreciation be in any way equally di&s;tributed. The monied man will become &s;uddenly rich; but the poor man, who has &s;eldom a week's ca&s;h beforehand, will be for ever labouring under taxes, to repair the lo&s;s en|tailed on the public by appreciation. Here it mu&s;t be noted, that I rea&s;on upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a total and <HI>permanent</HI> appreciation, but I mu&s;t &s;o far do ju&s;tice to my own &s;enti|ments,

as to declare my belief, that it is a matter ab&s;olutely impracticable; for though, by &s;trenuous efforts, it might be carried into execution, and money be univer&s;ally received at the declared value, I contend that it would be but of &s;hort duration; that its quantity would inevitably operate again&s;t its fixture; and continually pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the unnatural barrier, like a river dam'd in its cour&s;e, it would quickly overflow the banks, and deluge the adjacent country with irre&s;i&s;tible fury; tearing down whole cities and villages in its way; thou&s;ands upon thou&s;ands would be ruined by the attempt, and general confu&s;ion en&s;ue. All which may be prevented by &s;uffering the &s;tream to flow in its natural chan|nel, without ob&s;tructions. Let the money find its own weight, it will balance it&s;elf much better than can be done by any attempt of ours.</P>
<P>SOME are apprehen&s;ive, that if a check is not given to depreciation, the credit of the money will be reduced to &s;o low an ebb, as to become entirely &s;tagnant. The&s;e timid politicians would do well to look back to the money in its fir&s;t &s;tages of depreciation, and enquire of them&s;elves, what they would have thought, if &s;ome prying financier had a&s;|&s;ured them, that in le&s;s than 3 years its value &s;hould &s;ink to 40 for 1, would they not have a&s;&s;erted, with di&s;dain, that the matter was impo&s;&s;ible; that long before it arrived at &s;uch a &s;tage it would cea&s;e to circulate? Nor ought their fal&s;e judgments to have been too &s;everely reflected on, for the &s;ub|ject was but little &s;tudied, and le&s;s under&s;tood. But at pre|&s;ent we can look back, trace its progre&s;s and define its cau&s;e. And from a &s;eries of rea&s;oning, pronounce with &s;ome certainty, that no interruption to its pa&s;&s;ing can ari&s;e from its mere quantity. Should it gradually &s;ink, even to 1000 for 1, I freely declare my opinion, that it would pa&s;s as cur|rent as at pre&s;ent, and would be relatively as &s;carce. Per|haps we have not, in general, &s;ufficiently attended to the &s;ubject; otherwi&s;e we &s;hould not &s;o ha&s;tily a&s;&s;ert, that the depreciation has latterly run on with rapidity. It is an error and ari&s;es from a want of con&s;idering the proper progre&s;&s;ion of numbers.</P>
<P>WHEN the money &s;unk from one to two, we all agree that it &s;unk one in value, when it fell from two to three, it is &s;aid to have &s;unken one more; but this I deny, it only &s;unk half of one, and when it proceded from three to four, its gradation in&s;tead of being one, was only one third of one.
<PB N="17" REF="016820_0017_0F9E804CD302C688">
In other words, when it decrea&s;ed in value from two to four, it fell no fa&s;ter than in going from one to two. From four to eight, from eight to &s;ixteen, and from &s;ixteen to thirty-two, the actual decline is no greater than from one to two. Hence we find, that when money pa&s;&s;es from thirty to forty, it makes no larger &s;tep, than it did in going from three to four, that is one third more. When once we get into in|crea&s;ed numbers, we &s;hould con&s;ider, that we proceded by fractions. Exchange ri&s;ing from twenty to twenty-one, advances in fact only one twentieth. From twenty to twen|ty-five is only an advance of five twentieths, or one quar|ter; and from twenty to thirty it has only advanced ten twentieths, or one half; and that it mu&s;t run all the way from twenty to forty, before the depreciation becomes as great as it did when it ro&s;e from one to two, or from two to four; and the depreciation may continue from forty to eighty, without a greater acceleration than it had in pa&s;&s;ing from one to two. To render this &s;ubject a little more fa|miliar, as well as to point out the inju&s;tice of the pre&s;ent laws, re&s;pecting the payment of debts, we will once more call upon John Harrow for an illu&s;tration. We will &s;up|po&s;e John to pay an annuity out of his farm of 32<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per an|num, which &s;um he u&s;ually rai&s;ed by &s;ending hickory wood to town. Here the reader will ob&s;erve that the rates of ex|change, re&s;pecting the dates, are merely imaginary, and not confined to the true &s;tate.</P>

<P>BY this we perceive, that in 1776, money falling from the full value to two for one, John &s;aved half of the quan|tity of wood which he cut in 1775&mdash;In 1777 he &s;aved half of the quantity cut in 1776&mdash;In 1778 he &s;aved half of the quantity cut in 1777&mdash;In 1779 he &s;aved half the quantity cut in 1778,&mdash;and in 1780 he &s;aved half the quantity cut in 1779. When exchange went from par to two, it only advanced one in number, and when it proceded from &s;ixteen to thirty-two, tho' the depreciation was deemed alarming, its progre&s;s was but ju&s;t equal to the variation from one to
<PB N="18" REF="016820_0018_0F9E804D7B1EB460">
two. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e he &s;ent but half the quantity he did the preceding year; and in the &s;econd ca&s;e he likewi&s;e &s;ent but half the quantity; and thus we may go on to a very high amount. From the rate of thirty-two for one, we mu&s;t proceed as far as &s;ixty-four for one, before the money will &s;uffer depreciation equal to the fir&s;t alteration from one to two, and it mu&s;t then go on to one hundred and twenty-eight for one, before it has made another &s;tride &s;imilar to the fir&s;t. Now let any per&s;on look back to the late pro|gre&s;s of depreciation, and he will find that he has le&s;s occa|&s;ion to be alarmed, at this day, then he had when it varied from one to two. The jump then made, would have been truly alarming, if it had been properly attended to, but a mix|ture of caprice, fear and intere&s;t, produced an effect of which few were aware; and the&s;e cau&s;es continued to ope|rate, perhaps, till it arrived to four or &s;ix for one; by which time, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the waves which had been ex|cited by the agitation of the pa&s;&s;ions, were pretty well &s;ub|&s;ided, and the &s;urface of the financial ocean re&s;tored to its proper level. Effects followed their cau&s;es, and the &s;well increa&s;ed but as the wind blew. The quantity of the mo|ney determined its value, and &s;o it would probably continue to an exce&s;s which I &s;hould not choo&s;e to enter on. I know of no period to depreciation, or cau&s;e of &s;toppage from mere quantity. I am very &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e who have gi|ven them&s;elves the trouble to think on this &s;ubject, will charge me with u&s;ing needle&s;s repetitions, and labouring the matter beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary. But it is a &s;ubject of great importance, and cannot be too fully and clo&s;ely inve&s;tigated. The more points of view we place it in, the better it will be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In Portugal they calculate in mille-rees; that is, in pieces of &s;ilver, &s;uppo&s;ed to contain 1000 parts, being &s;omewhat more than one of the Spani&s;h dollars; now a thou&s;andth part of a dollar is a &s;um of which, at fir&s;t view, we have no adequate idea, when compared with a farthing, which is our lowe&s;t denomination; but affixing to it a compound va|lue, or calling it a mille-ree, we can readily &s;ubdivide it low enough for every purpo&s;e of trade. Then &s;uppo&s;e deprecia|tion &s;hould continue till it reached 1000 for 1, and we &s;hould change the denomination of a dollar to a mille-dollar, that is to a dollar &s;ubdivided into a thou&s;and parts, we &s;hould as ea&s;ily keep our accounts, and tran&s;act the affairs of trade
<PB N="19" REF="016820_0019_0F9E804E27B50230">
with as much preci&s;ion, as if we were trading in hard dol|lars. A paper bill in&s;tead of being called one dollar might repre&s;ent the thou&s;andth part of a dollar, and an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of money, if the rate was once e&s;tabli&s;hed. And this mode of calculation might continue, even after the paper dollars were all con&s;umed by a foreign loan, and real gold and &s;ilver became the only money current. Some may probably think I treat the point in too vi&s;ionary a manner; but I reque&s;t them to &s;it down &s;eriou&s;ly to the &s;ubject, and I will then venture to pronounce that they will inevitably fall into my train of thinking.</P>
<P>THEY will quickly acknowledge, that it is not the amount of nominal dollars which con&s;titutes the debt of America; which alone ari&s;es from the <HI>real</HI> value of home produce con|&s;umed, of foreign goods impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">d, and of labour, wages and &s;alaries paid; the&s;e con&s;titute our debt. With re&s;pect to the nominal amount in paper money, I contend that it is of &s;mall importance, whether the &s;um be called 5 millions or 500 millions, with this provi&s;o, that we do not, in the lat|ter ca&s;e, tran&s;mute paper into &s;ilver, and determine at all events to pay a hard dollar for every imaginary dollar emitted.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the crew of Captain Cooke's &s;hip, in his 3 years voyage round the South-Pole, had carried their amu&s;ement of gaming to &s;o high a pitch, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s notes of hand for the payment of the &s;ums lo&s;t, and that the&s;e notes had amounted to millions of pounds: Suppo&s;e they had even divided the entire &s;tock of provi&s;ions, and &s;ome had won from the others their whole &s;hare. I would a&s;k, whether the &s;hip would be interrupted in her voyage by &s;uch exchange of property, or would &s;he be le&s;s able to procede than if no &s;uch gaming had happened. As a little Common-wealth, her internal re&s;ources and abilities would undoubted|ly remain the &s;ame; the rich mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity permit the poor to partake of the &s;tock for the common good of the voyage, and the &s;hip's general de&s;ign of making new di&s;co|veries, would be pro&s;ecuted without any other difficulties, than tho&s;e naturally incident to the &s;ea, and the gradual de|cline of the &s;hip's &s;tock of provi&s;ions. If fre&s;h &s;upplies could from time to time be procured, they might &s;ail, play and pa&s;s notes from year to year, till the &s;hip's bottom could bear them no longer; but &s;hould it prove impracticable to com|mand &s;uch &s;upplies, then, and not till then, the voyage
<PB N="20" REF="016820_0020_0F9E804F0A0EDC10">
would from nece&s;&s;ity terminate. So with America&mdash;Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> the country can &s;upply the actual nece&s;&s;aries of government, no exce&s;s of paper money can prove a bar thereto. What we have mo&s;t to fear is from injudicious attempts to give a value to our currency beyond what its quantity demands.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to prove, that the decrea&s;e of the value of money has been generally occa&s;ioned by its increa&s;ed quan|tity; that in its progre&s;s it has operated as a tax; that Loan-Office Certificates are money to all intents and purpo&s;es, and therefore the intere&s;t ari&s;ing thereon is a burthen on the community, without our deriving the advantage thereby propo&s;ed; that in good policy, the&s;e Certificates &s;hould all be called in, and a ju&s;t compen&s;ation made to the holders; that foreign loans, during the pre&s;ent war, may prove ruin|ous drains to the Continent, and can an&s;wer no one good purpo&s;e more effectually than paper money would; that a total appreciation of the &s;um now current, would bring us under a debt, which an 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 tax for 400 years would &s;carcely clear us from, when on the contrary it is evident, the &s;ame tax of 1<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 would &s;ink the whole in le&s;s than ten years, if the money &s;hould remain at its pre&s;ent value. I have al&s;o en|deavoured to &s;hew, that depreciation has not been &s;o rapid as was generally thought; that an increa&s;e of quantity ought not to alarm us; that the fear of its becoming &s;tagnant is entirely groundle&s;s, and that it would circulate as freely as at pre&s;ent, although the quantity &s;hould be encrea&s;ed to a great exce&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the thoughts I have here thrown together &s;hould be deemed injurious to the common intere&s;ts of America, I &s;hould be obliged to the writer who would point it out; and &s;hould be happy to be relea&s;ed from the dread which has long preyed on my mind, that a general di&s;tre&s;s would be brought on the country by appreciating the money. I declare upon honor, that I am no other way intere&s;ted in the event, than as a citizen of America; nor have I, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, an advantage to make by depreciation, but am daily &s;uffering by it. I have &s;tated my &s;entiments with candour, and &s;ubmit them to the public; and all I a&s;k in return, is a candid per|u&s;al, and fair refutation, if I am wrong.</P>
