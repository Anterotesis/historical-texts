<P>IN the <HI>Content</HI> our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> is an&s;wering the bla&s;phemous Imputa|tion of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who charg'd Him with ca&s;ting out Devils by ver|tue of a Compact and Confederacy with <HI>Beelzebub, the prince of Devils.</HI> Our LORD argues the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> and perve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>Malice</HI> of that Objection; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> copious and cogent in the <HI>Argument.</HI> A w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">

1. A Repre&s;entation of the Devils <HI>quiet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of Mi&s;erable Per&s;ons: <HI>The &s;trong man armed keepeth his Palace and his goods are in peace.</HI> Now it appears by the <HI>Context.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That Satan is this &s;trong man armed.</HI> He is a Spirit of Mighty Strength and Power, and he is arm'd again&s;t God and us to do what mi&s;chief and hurt he can. On Earth there is not his like, and he is a King over all the Children of Pride. He is only under the re&s;traints and check of Almighty God, and and of His Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Angels which remain in the perfection of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Strength; and if it were not for this Ble&s;&s;ed and Superiour Power Sa|tan would make a wretched World know his &s;trength daily. We read of this wicked Power in <HI>Arms,</HI> and who he <HI>fights</HI> with: Rev. 12.7. <HI>And there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as war in Heaven; the Dra|gon and his Angels warring again&s;t Michael and his Angels</HI> This is the &s;trong man armed that dares to make War with the <HI>Lamb;</HI> the Lion of Hell again&s;t the <HI>Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Palace</HI> that he keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of is the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the Sinful Children of Men. This he has u&s;urp'd. God built it for Him|&s;elf and worthy of Him&s;elf. Sin betray'd it, by defiling it into Satans hands. There he keeps, rules and works; even in the Chil|dren of di&s;obedience. Here he lords, and tyrani&s;es: and does what he can to fortifye the Soul again&s;t Chri&s;t, and keep him out of it. It was once the <HI>Peaceful</HI> Palace of God,
<PB N="4" REF="001872_0005_0FB9721F42E8FAD8">now 'tis the &s;trong hold and Gari&s;on of a Rebel-tyrant and Out-law, <HI>in a &s;tate of War.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Satan <HI>quietly</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Impenitent Soul as if it were his <HI>Property. His Goods are in Peace.</HI> He calls it <HI>his</HI> Palace &amp; <HI>his</HI> Goods. He pleads a long quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the right of <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> if not <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> too. The Sin|ners Mind and Heart and Will are his; tamely <HI>yielded</HI> to him, wickedly <HI>u&s;ed</HI> for him. <Q>Satan rules without controul, his Lu&s;ts are done, and his Intere&s;t &s;erv'd; and all the Powers of the Soul are employ'd by him in his Service.</Q> They are his Goods; and the Sinner is <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and unconcern'd about the matter, is &s;ecure and merry, &s;ervile and obe|dient, likes his Ma&s;ter and loves his Service; has no &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery, nor fear of danger. <HI>Thus the &s;trong man armed keepeth his palace, and his goods are in peace:</HI> A ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the Devils quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mi&s;erable Souls.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">II. There follows a more plea&s;ing account of CHRISTS <HI>Re&s;cuing</HI> the poor Soul out of Satans hands. <HI>But when a &s;tronger than He &s;hall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour,</HI> &amp;c. So then,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>There is a stronger than the &s;trong man armed, even Chri&s;t</HI> If we &s;peak of Strength, lo he is &s;trong!

<ITEM>3. <HI>When he comes he will overcome.</HI> The Victory will fall to CHRIST. None ever exalted or hardned him&s;elf again&s;t God and pro&s;pered. <HI>Michael prevails.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now the Evidences of this Victory are <HI>two.</HI></P>

<ITEM>1. <HI>He taketh from him all his Armour wherein be tru&s;ted.</HI> What is that? What is <HI>Satans Armoury</HI> in which he puts his confidence, ac|counting him&s;elf &s;ure of the Sinner? And how does Chri&s;t <HI>take it away?</HI> Why, He breaks the power of Sin and Corruption in the Soul, (&s;ayes Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>) he rectifies its Mi&s;takes, delivers it from its Prejudices. When the Eyes are opened, and the Heart is humbled and changed, then Satans <HI>Armour</HI> is taken away. "The <HI>Sword</HI> is fir&s;t wre&s;ted out of Satans hand, and then the <HI>Scepter.</HI> Satan is bound and ca&s;t out him&s;elf.

<PB N="6" REF="001872_0007_0FB97228CF3F9850">bringing Souls into the love of it: taking away the chains of guilt and de&s;troying the Power of Sin. Thus Souls are turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>He divideth his &s;poils;</HI> or as it is in ano|ther place; <HI>He &s;poils his Hou&s;e.</HI> This is ea&s;ie to do after the Enemy is overcome and di&s;|arm'd. Upon <HI>Victory</HI> follows the taking the <HI>Spoils.</HI> The <HI>Conqueror</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es for him&s;elf the Palace, which he has taken, and from whence he has driven the <HI>Foe;</HI> or where he has taken him Captive. The Endowments of our Mind and Body, made u&s;e of before in the Service of Satan; our Powers and Inter|e&s;ts &s;o before devoted and deba&s;ed, are the&s;e <HI>&s;poils.</HI> Spoils wherein Satan once prided him, and &s;poils which God values and which &s;hould be Sacred to Him for ever. This is the Conquerors Reward, which he hangs up in the Temple of God for an Everla&s;ting Tri|umph: Col. 2.15. <HI>And having &s;poiled Prin|cipalities and Powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</HI> His Cro&s;s.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Having thus at large opened this Copious <HI>Text,</HI> I would offer from it the&s;e Four <HI>Ob&s;er|vations.</HI>

<ITEM>I. That the Soul of Man is a <HI>Palace</HI> which the Great GOD built for Him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That it is now become as a <HI>Gari&s;on,</HI> or &s;trong hold which Satan keeps again&s;t God.</ITEM>

<ITEM>IV. That the <HI>Victori|ous Saviour</HI> re&s;cues whom He plea&s;es, and will re&s;cue all His cho&s;en from Satans Power and Tyranny.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Of <HI>the&s;e</HI> in their Order, as God &s;hall Enable; and of the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> at this time.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE, I.</HI> That the Soul of Man is a noble Palace, which GOD has built for Him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>This is the Palace which the <HI>Text</HI> &s;peaks of; even Mans Soul, and tho' it is not here &s;poken of as the Palace of God, but much the contrary; yet from the beginning and Ori|ginally it was His only. Every hou&s;e has &s;ome Builder, but <HI>He that built all things in God:</HI> and for whom did He or could He make any thing, and every thing, but for <HI>Him&s;elf: for his plea&s;ure they are and were Created.</HI> But above other things God made his Rational and Intelligent Creatures for his own po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, u&s;e and propriety. This is common to <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men;</HI> Heaven is His Throne, and the Earth His Foot&s;tool; but Angels the In|habitants of Heaven, and Men the People of His Pa&s;ture Earth, were His own de&s;igned Habitation and Re&s;idence. He made both one and other in His own <HI>Image,</HI> in His like|ne&s;s. The Realms above He prepared for Angels; this Earth a <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> for Man, whom He placed an <HI>Imbodied Angel</HI> upon it, a Ce|le&s;tial Mind clothed in fle&s;h, crowned with
<PB N="8" REF="001872_0009_0FB9722BE8A4F3F8">glory and honour; and he walked with God, God vi&s;ited him daily and conver&s;ed with him, yea dwelt in him. This was Mans <HI>First State;</HI> He was the Re&s;idence and <HI>Man&s;ion of the Creator</HI> here upon Earth.</P>
<P>For what is a <HI>Palace?</HI> but &s;ome Dwelling of a <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>King,</HI> which he builds for him|&s;elf, for the <HI>Honour of his Maje&s;ty,</HI> and to &s;hew <HI>the Riches of his Kingdom.</HI> He builds it &s;pa|cious and large to keep his <HI>Court</HI> there, and &s;pares no Art and Co&s;t to render it <HI>Magnifi|cent</HI> and Sumptuous. Such now is the Crea|ture <HI>Man,</HI> taking Body and Soul together. He is a Stately and curious, ample and rich Building of God. The King of Glory pitch'd this <HI>Tabernacle</HI> upon Earth. The Body he form'd &amp; rais'd out of the du&s;t, and breath'd into his No&s;trils the breath of Life and made him this living Soul. The <HI>Body</HI> is a wonder|ful Structure, and was a much more <HI>Elegant</HI> piece of Workman&s;hip at the fir&s;t: but the <HI>Spirit</HI> therein tho' Invi&s;ible is a Creature of far more admirable and beautiful Powers. O the divine Art and Power, the Wi&s;dom and Glory of God, Con&s;picuous and A&s;to|ni&s;hing in producing the one and the other!</P>
<P>In &s;hort;</P>
<P>If a <HI>King builds</HI> &mdash; What le&s;s than a <HI>Palace?</HI> And where a <HI>King dwells</HI> &mdash; What is it but a Palace? If then God made Man to <HI>re&s;ide</HI> in him, We are the <HI>Palace of the Great King.</HI></P>
<P>And what find you in the Palaces of Kings here on Earth, which is not to be found in the Soul of Man.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="001872_0010_0FB9722D4CB20000">

<P N="3">3.

We are <HI>born in Sin,</HI> and Satan has the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in this State of Corruption and Apo&s;tacy; which remains thro' the whole Unregenerate Life.

II. <HI>Whence is it that Satan has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of the Souls of Men?</HI> The Palace was Gods, built for Him&s;elf and actually his Dwelling and Re&s;idence: <HI>How then came Sa|tan into it?</HI></P>
<P>Not to be &s;ure by any <HI>Legal Right,</HI> but by Tyranical <HI>&V;&s;urpation:</HI> Not by any power <HI>again&s;t</HI> God, or any freedom <HI>from</HI> his Power and Ju&s;tice, but by the righteous permi&s;&s;ion of a holy God, <HI>in Judgment and Puni&s;hment for our Sin.</HI> The &s;orry <HI>Traitor,</HI> the foul and fal&s;e <HI>U&s;urper</HI> boa&s;ts of a Right and Title, <HI>All the&s;e, and all this Power and Glory is mine;</HI> for <HI>to me they are delivered, and what&s;oever I will I do with them.</HI> He claims as by <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> over God, when as he only prevailed over weak Man by <HI>Subtlety</HI> and <HI>Fraud,</HI> and by the Judgment of a holy God is <HI>permitted</HI> to Po&s;&s;e&s;s and Tyrannize.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P><HI>The Palace was betray'd into Satans hands by Mans Sin.</HI> Man <HI>delivered up him&s;elf</HI> to the Devil by a ba&s;e and voluntary di&s;loyal <HI>yielding to his Temptation. Sin</HI> was the cur&s;ed thing that made God <HI>for&s;ake</HI> his Palace, for he cannot dwell with it; and this gave Sa|tan his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t <HI>Order</HI> and Com|mand of God was, that Sin &s;hould not be permitted to enter into and defile his Palace, on pain of his Departure in Wrath. God made Man Holy, Inclin'd him well, di&s;po&s;ed him only to that which is good, and to all
<PB N="31" REF="001872_0032_0FB97264CF7E0C98">that is &s;o! He gave him an expre&s;s <HI>Warning</HI> and Commandment, with a &s;evere and dreadful <HI>Threatning</HI> in ca&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The penalty was pre&s;ent De&s;ertion and utter De&s;truction. Neverthele&s;s the Devil by craft and &s;ubtlety beguiled and &s;educed Man into Sin. Man weakly, ungratefully, wilfully complied with Satans Motion. He treache|rou&s;ly gave him the <HI>Keys</HI> of the Palace, and receiv'd him into his own heart. The Holy God then for&s;ook his Earthly Tabernacle and Re&s;idence. He loath'd and abhorred the de|filed Place. He left mi&s;erable Man in tho&s;e cruel and filthy hands which he had put him&s;elf into. The Traitor &s;urrendred him|&s;elf into a Tyrants hand, and renounced God his righful Proprietor, and Gracious LORD. He revolted to the Devil at his fir&s;t Motion, from God that made him. It was a volun|tary Re&s;ignation to the declared Enemy of God, who had appear'd to him <HI>bare fac'd,</HI> giving God the <HI>lye,</HI> and <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> him of En|vying the Felicity of his Creature. He tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed in a defying manner to God, and in|&s;olently dar'd his Vengeance. God was far from willing or allowing Mans fall and ruine; He did all that was proper and rea|&s;onable to have re&s;trained and prevented him: He forbid it under the pain of Death, his highe&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure and an Everla&s;ting Exci&s;ion from him&s;elf. This is the Rice and Support of Satans Kingdom here on Earth and his Dominion over Men. He

<P>There needs no more to give Satan a full and entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Souls than our own Con&s;ent to him. And indeed nothing but that can give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Soul

<P>Indeed Natural Con&s;cience has not power <HI>now</HI> to govern a blind Mind and an ob&s;tinate Will. The will often carries it again&s;t the judgment of Rea&s;on and the Convictions of Con&s;cience. Con&s;cience is not hearkned to, but hector'd and In&s;ulted, oppos'd and re|&s;i&s;ted when he does condemn.

<P>Indeed Con&s;cience mu&s;t needs &s;uffer to|gether with and by the corruption of the Un|der&s;tanding and the Will: it wants the clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> light of the <HI>One</HI> to judge by, and violence is done it by the <HI>Other.</HI> But alas one Faculty is corrupted as well as the other.

<P N="4">4. I might add, if you will not think that I &s;tretch the Allu&s;ion too far, <HI>That there are many Outworks, by which Satan has deeply In|trench'd and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ortified about the Palace which he keeps:</HI> and every one of the&s;e lines he di&s;|putes and defends, that he may keep the Fort.

<P N="5">5.

The tree <HI>Cur&s;ed</HI> before it is cut down, and from that Moment <HI>drying up</HI> at the root. An utter and final Rejection from God, and a delivery of the wretched Soul over to Satan as his for ever. So Satan en|ter'd with the <HI>Sop</HI> into <HI>Judas,</HI> and his heart <HI>Petrify'd</HI> within him, and turn'd into a Stone, and at la&s;t <HI>di&s;&s;olv'd</HI> in de&s;pair, in the fire of Gods wrath.

God gives him up to vile affections, and unto &s;trong delu&s;ions, that he may be damned, becau&s;e he believed not the Truth, but had plea&s;ure in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. The Sinner becomes pa&s;t feeling, and gives him&s;elf over to work all Uncleanne&s;s with Greedine&s;s, as if his Con&s;cience were &s;eared with a hot Iron.

<HEAD>USE.</HEAD>
<P>Give me leave to make a Reflection or two on this deplorable Account of the matter.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>See the lamentable Change that is come upon us by Sin.</HI> In the change of the <HI>Inhabi|tant,</HI> and in the change of <HI>State</HI> con&s;equent there-upon. Once the Dwelling of <HI>God,</HI> now the Habitation of <HI>Devils</HI> &amp; of every unclean thing. From a Princely <HI>Palace</HI> turn'd into a <HI>Garri&s;on:</HI> From a Paradi&s;e of Plea&s;ure, Peace and Liberty, driven into Captivity, Bondage and Mi&s;ery: from the gentle Rule of a Rightful Gracious Prince, now the U&s;ur|pation of a Cruel Enemy. Into what <HI>Evil Hands,</HI> and into what a <HI>forlorn Condition</HI> has our Apo&s;tacy from God bro't us?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>See what Satans Motion to thee is in every Temptation unto Sin.</HI> It is this &mdash; Renounce God and Give thy &s;elf to me both Soul and
<PB N="45" REF="001872_0046_0FB9728D23733200">Body, to be mine for ever. With this hor|rid Motion the Sinner complies, tho' he only thinks of Gratifying and Indulging him&s;elf. So Souls are <HI>kidnapt</HI> by the Devil; <HI>Entic'd</HI> over into the <HI>Gardens</HI> of &s;in &amp; &s;en&s;e, as into &s;ome promis'd <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> but truly in the E|vent find them&s;elves <HI>Sold</HI> into the vile&s;t Slavery. If the Devil &s;hould appear to the Sinner and make the barefac'd Motion to him; "Soul, &s;ell thy &s;elf unto me; come, Seal a Contract to be mine for ever; Let me Enter into thee and po&s;&s;e&s;s and act thee; &mdash; would the Soul Con&s;ent? No, but with Infinite horror would &s;cream out and die away at the Motion. O believe it, Every Temptation to Sin, and unto Impenitence therein, is nothing better than this Cur&s;ed Motion: and this is thy State, and this thy Mi&s;ery, while you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly under the Power and Rule of any known Lu&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>See the Cur&s;ed Nature of Satan and of Sin: His Enmity</HI> again&s;t us, and the <HI>Mi&s;chiefs</HI> he has bro't upon us: How he is to be hated and dete&s;ted by us, and his Motions to be loath'd, abhorred and trembled at: what madne&s;s as well as how Impious it is to &s;ide with him, comply with him, and fight a|gain&s;t God: But alas! What Homage, Obe|dience and Service has he? He &s;ends his Imperious Me&s;&s;age like &s;ome Haughty <HI>Benha|dad</HI> to &s;ome Servile <HI>Ahab,</HI> "Thou and thy Riches and all that thou ha&s;t is Mine: and

<P N="4">4. <HI>See then what a Mighty Saviour Sinners need, to deliver them from the Power and Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Satan.</HI> And a Mighty One God <HI>has rai&s;ed</HI> up for us, (as if God will we may hear hereafter) even an <HI>Almighty One,</HI> His own <HI>Son</HI> in our Nature. He is manife&s;ted to <HI>de&s;troy the works of the Devil,</HI> to <HI>break the Serpents head;</HI> to deliver us from the power of Satan unto the glorious Liberty of the Kingdom of God. He is able to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t, able to <HI>brui&s;e Satan under our feet:</HI> The Devils <HI>tremble</HI> before him, <HI>confe&s;s</HI> him, and <HI>be&s;eech</HI> him not to torment them; and they <HI>fly</HI> at his Pre&s;ence and his Word. By Him <HI>all Devils &s;hall be judged</HI> at the la&s;t day, and receive their <HI>Doom</HI> from his Lips to an Eternal Torment.

<P N="2">2. <HI>By Repentance.</HI> This <HI>Spues</HI> out the Un|clean Spirit, when you loath your &s;elf for Sin before the Holy God. He cannot bear the Moans and Agonies of a repenting Soul.

<P N="3">3. <HI>By Prayer.</HI> This al&s;o he abhors from.

<P>There are <HI>Degrees</HI> of this Peace in Sin.

<P N="1">1. <HI>In &s;ome it is only a &s;tupid &V;nconcern, Carele&s;s|ne&s;s and Tho'tle&s;sne&s;s:</HI> and then it is u&s;ually the dull quiet of the Ignorant and Untaught, who know and have heard or minded little of God or His Word: for a vain and loo&s;e Education mu&s;t needs lay a foundation for unconcern about our Spiritual State.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In other it is a Pre&s;umptnous Hope.</HI> The vain Sinner will hope groundle&s;ly, and if he can but co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p the Word and corrupt Con|&s;cience to permit him this, he layes a &s;ure foundation for a <HI>fal&s;e Peace.</HI> <Q>The World is full of hope without a Promi&s;e; &s;aid the De|vout Mr. <HI>Flavel.</HI> A Hope whereof a Man

<P N="3">3. <HI>In others this fal&s;e Peace ri&s;es into a fal&s;e Joy.</HI> And this is natural 'eno, for as a pre|&s;umptuous hope cries <HI>Peace, Peace</HI> to the Sin|ner it mu&s;t needs <HI>cheer</HI> him in his evil way. This fond delu&s;ion of &s;elf-love is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trong, that it may buoy the light and vain heart over the Billows of Adver&s;ity thro' this Life, and tho&s;e of Death at the End of it. As bladders of Wind may make a &s;hift to keep the head above Water. <HI>They are not in trouble and they have no Bands in their death.</HI> They die with &s;ome Expectation that it will be well with them hereafter.</P>
<P>Indeed many that live &s;tupidly and quiet|ly in Sin die &s;o too, and they that ignorantly and loo&s;ely take up fond hopes of their good E&s;tate die with le&s;s fear and di&s;tre&s;s very often than many of the Godly them&s;elves. To this length may &s;ecurity &s;ometimes go.</P>
<P>But after all, <HI>It is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eet to be called Peace of Soul,</HI> which is a Great and ble&s;&s;ed thing whereof this is but the fiction. <HI>True Peace is a gracious Tranquillity and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nity of Mind built on the &s;olid principles of Religion, the un|changeable Promi&s;es and Covenant-faithfulne&s;s of God; the Experience of his Good Work in us, and the certain Exerci&s;e and Actings of Grace toward God.</HI> The Wicked are far from this,

<P>It comes of Infidelity and Unbelief, Pro|fane&s;s and Contempt of God, pre&s;umption and fearle&s;sne&s;s, fle&s;hline&s;s and &s;en&s;uality.

<P>This cur&s;ed quiet and &s;ecurity fru&s;tures all Awakning Means, receives all the terrors

All his Works are ordered, directed and managed by Him. The Sun, Moon and Stars <HI>obey</HI> Him (we &s;ay) in all their Motions. His Will is their Rule &amp; Law which guides and limits them. But <HI>all this is not properly Government,</HI> nor &s;trictly <HI>Obedience</HI> in them. The Creature knows not the Will of its <HI>Ma|ker,</HI> nor is &s;en&s;ible of its own Being and Mo|tion, U&s;e and Service. <HI>Government</HI> is of the Superiour, Rea&s;onable and Intelligent Crea|tures, <HI>Angels and Men</HI> The&s;e are capable of <HI>Law</HI> and of a free Subjection, and a willing Service. The&s;e have a Law written in their Nature. Over <HI>them</HI> therefore God reigns. The&s;e are His Subjects and the People of his Kingdom, being his Noble&s;t Creation and Workman&s;hip. He maketh his <HI>Angels</HI> Spi|rits, the Mini&s;ters of His Kingdom both of
<PB N="90" REF="001872_0091_0FB97315D89C79E0">Providence &amp; Grace; they excel in Strength, Knowledge and Holine&s;s. He made <HI>Man</HI> like them a Living Soul; in His own Image, who is a Spirit and the Father of Spirits; and all Souls are His, and <HI>we are His OFF|SPRING.</HI></P>
<P>Now here is the <HI>Perfection of Rule,</HI> of Know|ledge and Power; to know the Tho'ts of the heart, and &s;earch it, and turn and change it as it plea&s;es GOD. Others can reach the Body, order and in&s;pect our outward Beha|viour, and puni&s;h the Overt Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but the Mind is free and not to be bro't under the Power of any. <HI>Humane Laws</HI> can pre|&s;cribe only to the outward Life and Actions, and take Cognizance only of Mens Manners: But it is the Glory of God, his Laws, and his Government that he looks to the Heart within, requires the Love and Service of that, and will accept nothing le&s;s; but the Tho't of Wickedne&s;s is Sin before him and he judges therefor. Jer. 17.10. <HI>I the Lord &s;earch the Heart, I try the Reins.&mdash;.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Con&s;cience</HI> within us is His <HI>Vicegerent.</HI> He has created it, endow'd and impower'd it, and to Him it is Accountable. He has given it Knowledge, and he Commi&s;&s;ions it, and to Him it renders in its Regi&s;ter and Te&s;timony. For <HI>the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, &s;earching all the inward parts of the Belly,</HI> Prov. 20.27. This is GODS Government, where|by he rules over the Highe&s;t and the lea&s;t. The Hearts of Kings are in his Hand and he
<PB N="91" REF="001872_0092_0FB973174F18A790">turns them, &amp; cuts off the Spirits of Princes. In this He appears to be the Ble&s;&s;ed and Only Potentate; the King Immortal, Invi&s;ible and only Wi&s;e; from who&s;e Spirit and Pre&s;ence there is no hiding, no flying. Such Know|ledge is too wonderful for Man; it is High and he cannot attain unto it.</P>
<P>In a word, This Empire over Souls and Spirits takes in the Dominion of the <HI>va&s;t Hades,</HI> the un&s;een World; the <HI>Key</HI> whereof is put into the Redeemers Hand: In Compa|ri&s;on whereof the <HI>Millions</HI> of Souls on our <HI>lit|tle Globe</HI> are but a &s;mall Number, and as a <HI>&s;ingle Family.</HI> How many Millions of Im|mortal spritis pa&s;s out of this World of ours, in every Age of it, into this <HI>Hades?</HI> Be&s;ides the <HI>Myriads</HI> of Angels and <HI>Legions</HI> of Devils there before! What a Kingdom of God is <HI>here</HI> without limits, or any Number of its Ho&s;ts! <HI>this Empire over Souls or Spirits!</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e GOD has &s;ubjected the re&s;t of his Glorious <HI>Creation,</HI> made them for Dominion, &amp; <HI>put all things under their feet;</HI> re&s;erving <HI>them</HI> to be his <HI>Own Dominion</HI> and Servants, becau&s;e the Superiour Orders of Being.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t Note which I commended to your &s;erious Attention, That there is no Empire or Rule in Nature like that which is over the Soul and Spirit. The next <HI>Ob&s;erva|tion</HI> I would make is,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That there is no Rule or Empire over Souls here on Earth like that which God di&s;plays
<PB N="92" REF="001872_0093_0FB97318E0B0DDB0">in the Work of Sanctification,</HI> or his &s;aving work of Grace wro't and carried on in our Souls by His Holy Spirit. There are other wonderful Proofs and In&s;tances of GODS Go|verning the Spirits of Men in the common Rule of His Providence: there being indeed no &s;uch thing at all as a Providence over Humane Affairs, without a particular Know|ledge of and Power over Mens Spirits; di|recting and over-ruling them as the Alwi&s;e <HI>Governour of Heaven and Earth</HI> &s;ees meet and nece&s;&s;ary; Inclining or re&s;training them, and changing their Purpo&s;es and Coun&s;els, accor|ding to his own Will &amp; unto his own Glory. There is a powerful in&s;en&s;ible Operation of Providence on the Spirits of Men, which puts no force on their Freedom, Liberty and Choice, but yet governs their Will to its own Purpo&s;e and Council. But now the Work of Grace, Conver&s;ion &amp; Regeneration, and the progre&s;s of our Sanctification is a more <HI>manife&s;t and Eminent Empire of GOD</HI> over our Spirits than all this.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is Gods Glorious Efficiency.</HI> The <HI>Ex|cellency of the Power</HI> is of GOD and not of Man. The Word is the Power of GOD un|to Salvation. The Day of a Souls Conver|&s;ion is the Day of GODS Power<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 1.18. 4.20. P&s;al. 110.3. 2 Cor. 4.7. Eph. 1.19.</NOTE> For who but GOD can change the Soul? give a new heart? renew the Mind and Spirit? form
<PB N="93" REF="001872_0094_0FB97323CFCC4020">and make a New Creature? For there is a new Mind given, a new Will, new Affecti|ons, new Purpo&s;es and Re&s;olutions, new Strength and Power, and &s;o a newne&s;s of Life produced. This is Dominion, Rule and Government over our Spirits with a wit|ne&s;s: An Ab&s;olute Power exerted upon them, whereby they are reformed and re&s;tored, ac|cording to the Will, and into the Image of God, who worketh all in all. <HI>This is the Exceeding Greatne&s;s of His Power to Us-ward who believe, according to the Working of his Mighty Power.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is all Efyected &amp; Carried on in a way of Rule &amp; Government: by a Divine Regency which is mo&s;t Free and Gracious.</HI> An Act of true Dominion, bringing the Rea&s;onable Crea|ture in a Way agreable to its rational Na|ture, Liberty &amp; Faculties, into a cho&s;en Sub|jection to God. To &s;et this in a true light we need only con&s;ider the <HI>Means</HI> which the Holy Gho&s;t u&s;es, and the <HI>Method</HI> which he takes with us in this glorious Work: And this is &s;uch as is mo&s;t proper to the Govern|ment of a <HI>Soul.</HI> That is to &s;ay, He works on the Soul <HI>by that In&s;pired Word and revealed Law</HI> which He hath given for our Govern|ment, to regulate us &amp; to be Obeyed by us. His <HI>Word</HI> is the Rule of Holine&s;s and of our Duty. It pre&s;cribes both to the Outward Life, and to the Inward Tho'ts, Affections &amp; De&s;ires. It is a Law to our Con&s;ciences, and it is quick &amp; powerful as a Sword to peirce
<PB N="94" REF="001872_0095_0FB97324D0F3BCA8">into the Inmo&s;t Soul; a Di&s;cerner of the Tho'ts and intents of the Hearts, and a judge of them. This Divine Word is the <HI>Ordinary Means</HI> which the Spirit of GOD u&s;es in Convincing &amp; Converting Sinners; and to that End the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> of it is Ordained, and by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD with it is made In&s;trumental &amp; Efficacious. Now this is Agreable to our Nature and the pro|per Government of Rea&s;onable Creatures. <HI>For God made Man to be rul'd by a Law and Precept.</HI> He wrote his Law in Mans heart at fir&s;t, and &s;ome Remains of it abide in his Apo&s;tacy. He gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn'd Man in his Integri|ty by a Law and Commandment, requiring a perfect Obedience of him; by a Promi&s;e and a Threatning, by Hopes &amp; Fears. And &s;o he doth yet by the <HI>Written</HI> Law, Precepts and Prohibitions, Promi&s;es and Threats. He u&s;es the proper Means, Humane and Ra|tional, to Inform Enlighten and Convince the <HI>Judgment,</HI> to per&s;wade and overcome the <HI>Will,</HI> to move the <HI>Affections,</HI> De&s;ire and Loa|thing, Love and Hatred, Hope &amp; Fear, Grief and Joy; and by all to Alarm the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> Encourage and Deter us, as His Glory and our Happine&s;s do direct. In this way Sove|raign Grace gets the Dominion again in the Soul of Man, and in this way it maintains it: Which is the Way of a <HI>Rational Domini|on,</HI> the Governing <HI>by Law</HI> free &amp; Intelligent Beings. The Divine Government in our Souls is upheld by the Law of the Kingdom.
<PB N="95" REF="001872_0096_0FB9732782853F98"><HI>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God. Of His own Will be begets us by the Word of Truth.

<P>Thus the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> accompanies this Word of the Kingdom with an Invi&s;ible and Irre&s;i&s;tible Ble&s;&s;ing, whereby he &s;ubdues the Enmity of the Heart again&s;t the Divine Law, and brings it to &s;ubmit freely thereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Herein is the Kingdom of Satan in the Soul overthrown, and the Oppo&s;ite glorious Reign of Holine&s;s &s;et up in its stead.</HI> Satan is di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed and Souls recovered from Sin unto God.

<PB N="96" REF="001872_0097_0FB9732891DE8A08">The&s;e are &s;tubborn, fierce and irreconcilable Foes, &s;ubtle and &s;trong, fighting for their life and for the Dominion which they have u&s;urp'd over us. <HI>All the Powers of Hell</HI> are in Arms again&s;t every Souls Salvation, and every Soul has a treacherous <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> &s;iding with the Powers of Darkne&s;s.

<P>For indeed <HI>Satan had made a Spoil of us.</HI> He had &s;poiled <HI>God</HI> of his <HI>Creature</HI> Man, and of any Service or Glory from him without a Redemption.

</LIST></P>
<P>To which I might have added, the <HI>Frame, Ends</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> of this holy Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ider the <HI>Glorious Object of Wor|&s;hip, the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD;</HI> it will ea&s;ily appear that we &s;hould be very glad of every call we have to go up to his Hou&s;e. God is the mo&s;t <HI>Delectable Object</HI> which the Soul of Man can conver&s;e with, being infinitely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible Perfections, Excellencies and Glo|ries. Therefore to approach unto him &s;hou'd be the highe&s;t Plea&s;ure of our Souls; and if we were in our <HI>Original State of Rectitude</HI> it certainly wou'd be &s;o. We have directly to do with <HI>God</HI> in our &s;olemn Acts of Wor&s;hip, <HI>Him</HI> we &s;peak and addre&s;s unto immediately, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d <HI>He</HI> &s;peaks to us; to him we make our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rings, and of him we &s;upplicate for Grace and Mercy. Now God is the &s;upream Object of the delight of all <HI>Intelligent Beings,</HI> and the whole of Religion lies very much in
<PB N="139" REF="001872_0139_0FB973A076DC28B0">that Precept, P&s;al. 33.4. <HI>Delight thy &s;elf in the Lord.</HI> If we were called to go to the Pre&s;ence of our <HI>Earthly Ring,</HI> to ask and re|ceive any Favours from him, being a&s;&s;ured that it wou'd be very acceptable to him to &s;ee and hear us with our Petition, with what Joy and Plea&s;ure &s;hou'd we go to pre&s;ent our &s;elves before him? In like manner when we go to wor&s;hip, we &s;hou'd <HI>go unto God as our exceding Joy,</HI> P&s;al. 43.4.</P>
<P>And accordingly this has been the <HI>Frame</HI> of wor&s;hipping Saints. As they have had Joy in wor&s;hipping, &s;o their Rejoycing has been e&s;pecially in the <HI>Glorious Object</HI> they Adored. P&s;al. 9.2. <HI>I will be glad and rejoyce in thee, I will &s;ing prai&s;e to thy Name, O wast High.</HI> P&s;al. 32.11. <HI>Be glad in the Lord and rejoyce ye Righteous.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed if God were not infinitely to be <HI>delighted</HI> in on the account of his E&s;&s;ential Glories and Perfections, he wou'd not be the <HI>Object</HI> of wor&s;hip, neither wou'd there be any <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> in wor&s;hip. Make the <HI>Object</HI> of wor&s;hip any other but <HI>God,</HI> and there is no <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in any Act of <HI>Adoration.</HI> For In|&s;tance, <HI>What a dull and stupid thing mu&s;t is be to wor&s;hip a graven Image;</HI> a <HI>dumb</HI> and <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> a <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> and <HI>lifele&s;s Deity?</HI> If people wou'd but u&s;e their Sen&s;es and Rea&s;on this wou'd appear to be the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ordid</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;otri&s;h</HI> Act of their lives. The <HI>P&s;almist</HI> mo&s;t ju&s;tly re|pre&s;ents the Satisfaction of wor&s;hipping the <HI>li|ving God,</HI> but the extream Lumpi&s;hne&s;s and Ab|&s;urdity

The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> amplifies with a great deal of holy Scorn and <HI>Sarca&s;m</HI> on this head: I&s;ai. 44 9, 10, &amp;c. <HI>Who hath formed a God that is profitable for nothing! they and their delectable things are vanity: the Carpenter &s;tretches out his rule, marks it out with a line, fitteth it with planes, makes the figure of a Man, according to the beau|ty of a Man, warms him&s;elf with the chips, and then falls down and wor&s;hips it, and &s;aith to it, Deliver me, for thou art my God.</HI> Now to be &s;ure there can be no more plea&s;ure in the <HI>Adoring,</HI> than there was in the <HI>hewing and hacking the Log.</HI> Which is the mo&s;t a <HI>Stock</HI> at la&s;t, the <HI>Image</HI> or its <HI>Adorer</HI> is le&s;t doubt|ful.

<P>So that all the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of Plea&s;ure in wor|&s;hip mu&s;t be from the glorious Object, GOD.

<P N="2">II.

6. <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion for Others</HI> is another part of Prayer, which &s;hould make it plea&s;ant to us to go up unto the Hou&s;e of Prayer.
