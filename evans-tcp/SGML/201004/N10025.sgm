<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PLYMOUTH controver&s;y hath made a great noi&s;e in the country: It hath been of long &s;tanding, and very various have been the reports about it: That peo|ple might have right conceptions of the matter, I publi&s;hed my E&s;&s;ays. They have now met with an an&s;wer; whether it be full and &s;ufficient, mu&s;t be left to the world to judge. What <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had in the affair, I am not able with preci&s;ion to determine; but there are evident traces of <HI>another hand</HI> in &s;everal parts of his reply; the natural effect of his <HI>famous journey by night.</HI> But whoever was concerned, &s;ince he is plea&s;ed to <HI>father</HI> the whole, I &s;hall treat it as his general offspring. It has been <HI>long</HI> a preparing; the rea&s;on of this delay I know not: Word was given out in mid-winter (after a certain <HI>packet</HI> was received) that it would &s;oon be ready; but it ap|peared not upon the &s;tage, till late in the &s;pring. One would naturally think, that after &s;o long a time it would come forth more perfect, and be a thorough an&s;wer to every thing that I had alledged: But this is not the ca&s;e; &s;everal things of great
<PB N="6" REF="012739_0004_0F8BEA86B9635478">importance are left almo&s;t wholly unno|ticed, and &s;entences and &s;craps of &s;enten|ces are picked out here and there, and man|gled at a &s;trange rate, and the mi&s;repre|&s;entations are innumerable: A method of proceedure tending to bewilder the reader, and perpetuate the controver&s;y: In&s;tead of throwing light, it only throws darkne&s;s on the &s;ubject. It may perhaps gain the applau&s;e of the vulgar (for whom it &s;eems e&s;pecially calculated) and rai&s;e their indig|nation again&s;t me; but men of learning and penetration will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that the merits of the cau&s;e are not touched.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e indeed, that he is pleading, looks with a good face: The purity of churches, keeping out unregenerates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;ounds plea&s;ing and captivating to <HI>&s;erious &s;ouls,</HI> and they will be ready to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t any one whom he repre&s;ents as mak|ing the church (which is an <HI>inclo&s;ed garden</HI>) a meer common, or a cage for every un|clean and hateful bird. By the like &s;ounds, the <HI>&s;eparates</HI> in&s;nared many zealous and god|ly people in the late day, and gained great advantages again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed churches. And will he tread in their &s;teps? For my part I am as much for a <HI>godly di&s;cipline</HI> as he (which is much wanted;) but at the &s;ame time am for allowing all privileges
<PB N="7" REF="012739_0005_0F8BEA87F9485E20">to <HI>"proper members"</HI> of the church when|ever a&s;ked for, if they are not guilty of <HI>cen&s;urable evil.</HI> And as for <HI>practice,</HI> is he more <HI>&s;trict</HI> than his brethren? BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL MEN, that Mr <HI>R.</HI> hath been, ever &s;ince his &s;ettlement, as large in his admi&s;&s;i|ons or in his <HI>practical charity</HI> as I could de&s;ire or any mini&s;ter I know, and perhaps larg|er in &s;ome in&s;tances than I &s;hould have been. And <HI>even now</HI> I have rea&s;on to think, that he would exclude none that &s;hould apply (if they would come to full communion) whom Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> would have received. At lea&s;t it is evident from his <HI>piece</HI> (as well as practice) that he would receive them at <HI>&s;econd hand,</HI> if any &s;uch &s;hould remove into his pari&s;h, or be occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent on communion days; and that he is even will|ing to hold communion in all other ways, with &s;uch churches as are built on Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s plan; (&s;ee <HI>p.</HI> 63.) which is a much greater <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> than any he endeavors to fa&s;ten on me.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> let me drop a tear that it is &s;o much neglected. It is lamentable to think, that the church-mem|ber&s;hip of children is looked upon as &s;uch a little thing; they &s;eem to be left by the church as lambs in a large pa&s;ture; little or no care is taken of them; all proper
<PB N="8" REF="012739_0006_0F8BEA8897721EF8">re&s;traint &s;eems almo&s;t at an end. And even when &s;uch are &s;poken of by others, they are treated as no part of the church; or if as really <HI>without,</HI> and communicants <HI>only</HI> were members. Hence how frequent the lan|guage, "&s;uch a one was admitted into the church at &s;uch a time; &s;uch a one is not a member, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" when in reality they were <HI>complete members</HI> before. This <HI>by cu&s;tom</HI> is &s;o riveted in the minds of many, that they cannot get rid of the notion; hence natu|rally ari&s;e prejudices again&s;t the practice we are pleading for, as if it was a pro&s;titution of ordinances to tho&s;e that <HI>do not belong to the church.</HI> But this is not the ca&s;e in other churches at a di&s;tance, neither was it &s;o with us from the beginning. Our fathers always treated <HI>baptized per&s;ons</HI> as <HI>members,</HI> as I have noted in the E&s;&s;ays, and exerci&s;ed di&s;cipline over them as much as over communicants. And why is it not &s;o at this day? Surely, if primitive di&s;cipline were revived and kept up with rigor, and mini&s;ters would duly di&s;charge their duty in training up the <HI>bap|tizati</HI> for the Lord's-table (as the two Mr. <HI>Henrys,</HI> Mr. <HI>Havel</HI> and others have done) there would &s;oon be little occa&s;ion for the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.</P>
<P>It is further matter of grief and lamen|tation, that there are &s;o few <HI>proper &s;ubjects</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="012739_0007_0F8BEA8FB450F5A8">of di&s;cipline; I mean that there are &s;uch an amazing number of <HI>unbaptized per&s;ons</HI> among us. For (&s;urprizing to tell) it is affirmed by &s;ome who be&s;t know the circum&s;tances of the town, that there are at lea&s;t <HI>two thirds,</HI> if not <HI>three quarters,</HI> of the children in this place, who remain unbaptized. And is this a <HI>proper &s;ea&s;on</HI> to lay &s;till <HI>further re&s;tricti|ons</HI> on the ordinance of bapti&s;m? What &s;hall we then come to (according to an ordinary cour&s;e of providence) at la&s;t? In what &s;ituation will the next generation be? And what is as &s;urprizing to tell, I never heard <HI>one whole &s;ermon</HI> &s;ince my return to the town, reproving this neglect: But it has only been touched upon two or three times in &s;ome tran&s;ient expre&s;&s;ions, and blended with other particulars. The mo&s;t that he ever &s;aid on this head was in tho&s;e &s;ermons he mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 2. and then he &s;tood upon it but a few minutes: His &s;trength being chiefly exhau&s;ted on the head of <HI>qualifications;</HI> and <HI>coming without gracious &s;incerity,</HI> appeared in a much more awful light, than <HI>not coming at all</HI> (direct|ly contrary to <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 14.) In other places, I think all over <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> it is com|mon to compute the number of inhabi|tants, by the number of <HI>chri&s;tenings:</HI> From
<PB N="10" REF="012739_0008_0F8BEA8FE15C8318">whence we may infer what their general practice is. But if &s;uch computation &s;hould be made in the public prints re&s;pecting us by the <HI>number of chri&s;tenings,</HI> we &s;hould ap|pear a place diminutive indeed (though the fir&s;t in <HI>New-England</HI>) and hardly wor|thy of the lea&s;t public notice.</P>
<P>But not to inlarge further. I &s;hall clo&s;e this preface with ob&s;erving a few things relative both to his and my reply.</P>
<P>As to <HI>his</HI>&mdash;The reader cannot but take notice how he, every where, both in his let|ters and book, links in the brethern with him. He &s;eems only to &s;tand forth in their behalf and to plead their cau&s;e, and &s;peaks of him&s;elf as but one of many who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the practice; withal in|&s;inuating, that all the &s;trokes I had again&s;t him were aqually leveled again&s;t them. This method he takes (out of policy) to ingratiate him&s;elf, and to fa&s;ten them the more to him. Whereas in fact "it is he <HI>alone,</HI> that is the &s;ource and &s;pring of all; and if he &s;hould once cea&s;e his oppo&s;ition, I doubt not the re&s;t would do &s;o too: If he &s;hould tell them (as <HI>Roger Williams</HI> did his hear|ers,) "that he had mi&s;led them, that he was now convinced that he was in an er|ror, and that prayer and &s;tudy had brought
<PB N="11" REF="012739_0009_0F8BEA90CC156A10">him to be of another mind." There is not a man of them, I believe, but would acqui|e&s;ce, and be intirely ea&s;y with the conti|nuance of the practice. I would further notice his frequent phra&s;e, <HI>my &s;cheme, my plan,</HI> &amp;c. as if I was &s;ingular in my opini|on, and differed from all the world be&s;ides. Whereas in <HI>the main</HI> I agree with my <HI>fa|thers</HI> and brethren in the point: But we, enjoying <HI>their</HI> light and &s;tanding on their &s;houlders, may po&s;&s;ibly make &s;ome im|provement of things they did but ju&s;t glance at: As Dr. <HI>B.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> have made great improvements of &s;ome ca&s;ual hints thrown out by Mr. <HI>Edwards.</HI></P>
<P>And now in regard of the <HI>an&s;wer</HI> here exhibited, I have compleated it, without taking a journey by night. And I have <HI>pre&s;umed</HI> to make it, although &s;ome of his chief men have given out, that his piece was "deci&s;ive and unan&s;werable;" and although he him&s;elf hath &s;aid, "that <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> controver&s;y, he believed, would "be a means of bani&s;hing the half-way practice out of this part of the country;" as much as to &s;ay, that <HI>his book</HI> would produce this marvellous effect. Whether it will or no, time mu&s;t di&s;cover: But there &s;eems lit|tle pro&s;pect of it at pre&s;ent; for I have
<PB N="12" REF="012739_0010_0F8BEA9140004650">heard it ob&s;erved by &s;everal, that in le&s;s than a week after his books came up, they &s;eemed to be as <HI>dead</HI> almo&s;t as if they ne|ver had a being; no exultations, no triumphs, no congratulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were heard of, and indeed but little di&s;cour&s;e about them. So that it &s;eemed to &s;ome almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to make a reply: But upon &s;everal accounts, it appears to me (as well as to others) ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: And the reader will perhaps be of the &s;ame mind, before he has done.</P>
<P>But to come to what I more particular|ly intended to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>In regard of the <HI>general controver&s;y,</HI> I de|&s;ire it may be remembred, that all my pleas go upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that there will be unregenerate per&s;ons in the church: And the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition mu&s;t be made upon his plan, or any plan what&s;oever. According to the &s;tandard Chri&s;t gives his church, they <HI>cannot be kept out:</HI> And if they are in already, they <HI>mu&s;t not be ca&s;t out,</HI> with|out plain proofs of their unregeneracy. &s;hould this be the ca&s;e of any, they mu&s;t be left to God and <HI>their own con&s;cience.</HI> In the mean time, the church ought to treat them as regu|lar members, and grant them the privileges they a&s;k for: And if they (or the pa&s;tor
<PB N="13" REF="012739_0011_0F8BEA921F25F020">alone) upon conjectures and &s;u&s;picions go about to exclude them, they act an un|warrantable part, &s;uch privileges being their <HI>proper birth-right</HI> by <HI>divine grant,</HI> till &s;uch time as an ab&s;olute forfeiture be made, and full conviction takes place. And this I de&s;ire may be kept in mind.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the <HI>particular con|trover&s;y</HI>&mdash;I am really grieved, that I am ob|liged to continue it. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> might have prevented it with three or four words &s;peaking. But he was too <HI>haughty</HI> and <HI>grand</HI> to make the lea&s;t conce&s;&s;ion. And he mu&s;t take the con&s;equence. I am &s;ure I take no delight in expo&s;ing him: But a regard to truth, my own reputation, and even the intere&s;t of religion obliged me to clear my&s;elf of his a&s;per&s;ions: I &s;ay, the <HI>intere&s;t of religion.</HI> For who will regard any thing I advance in the general controver&s;y, if they think me &s;uch a man as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> repre&s;ents me to be? I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that he &s;hould take the liberties he has done; that he &s;hould give &s;uch &s;cope to mi&s;repre&s;entation and abu&s;e, when he could not but know how ea&s;ily he might be detected: But I &s;uppo&s;e he thought, that either his <HI>great name</HI> or <HI>popularity,</HI> would bear down all be|fore it, or that I &s;hould be uncapable of
<PB N="14" REF="012739_0012_0F8BEA9467DE5C20">an&s;wering the <HI>argumentative part</HI> of his book: And if &s;o, that it would be an idle attempt for me ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely to endeavor to re&s;cue my name from per&s;onal invective or abu&s;e; and of con&s;equence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bear the load for ever. But perhaps in both, or either, he will find him&s;elf di&s;appointed. In the following reply, I have endeavored to treat him with moderation and temper, and to avoid per&s;onal reflections and re|criminations as much as po&s;&s;ible: How|ever, the charges he hath brought again&s;t me (many of them unnece&s;&s;arily, merely to load me with obloquy and reproach, with|out the lea&s;t advantage to his cau&s;e,) ren|der it nece&s;&s;ary for me &s;ometimes to touch on that &s;tring, though in very gentle de|grees, con&s;idering the occa&s;ion. He ob|&s;erves in his preface, <Q>That his people judged it needful for him to vindicate him&s;elf from the unkind a&s;per&s;ions I had ca&s;t upon him, lea&s;t his character and u&s;e|fulne&s;s &s;hould be hurt among &s;trangers.</Q> But if what I have heard be true, this was <HI>judged needful</HI> merely by a <HI>junto</HI> of them, and that the <HI>major part</HI> were rather again&s;t his writing, and would have been glad if he had forbore, le&s;t it &s;hould make matters <HI>more de&s;parate</HI> than ever; as appears now to
<PB N="15" REF="012739_0013_0F8BEA95159C93D8">be really the ca&s;e; for he hath managed in &s;uch a manner, as to render a reply ab&s;o|lutely <HI>needful,</HI> lea&s;t tho&s;e who are "unac|quainted with affairs in this place" be mi&s;|led by wrong and ungrounded accounts and mi&s;repre&s;entations. This is not only my opinion, but the opinion of many others, even of &s;ome that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> reckons among the number of his <HI>friends.</HI></P>
<P>I leave the whole to the readers animad|ver&s;ion, begging them to weigh matters in an impartial ballance (even the ballance of the &s;anctuary) and not be &s;wayed by per|&s;onal regard either on the one &s;ide or the other. And may the God of truth lead us into all truth. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is a true but melancholy ob&s;ervation, that the ordinance of the &s;upper, which is an ordinance of peace and love, has been the occa&s;ion of more feuds and ani|mo&s;ities in the chri&s;tian world, than almo&s;t any other thing whatever. The contentions about the ordinance of bapti&s;m have neither been &s;o frequent nor long continued; I find little traces of them till &s;omething above 200 years ago, when the &s;ect of the <HI>anabapti&s;ts</HI> aro&s;e in <HI>Germany.</HI> Since which time, the <HI>poedo-bapti&s;t</HI> controver&s;y hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and a &s;mall number have ever appeared in oppo&s;ition; but other controver&s;ies in relation to bapti&s;m have been rare. The controver&s;y in which we are at pre&s;ent engaged, &s;eems to be unknown in other parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> it &s;carce reaches beyond the confines of <HI>New-England.</HI> Other churches &s;eem agreed to allow church-privileges to members bap|tized whenever a&s;ked for, if of &s;ober and regular lives; and the generality of our churches have long been in the &s;ame &s;entiments. But of late there &s;eems to be a di&s;po&s;ition in many to lay a re&s;tricti|on on &s;uch members, and to exclude them from <HI>any</HI> privilege without they &s;ee their way clear to a&s;k for <HI>every one; all</HI> or <HI>none</HI> are the terms in&s;i&s;ted on. Whether this be right or not is the pre&s;ent que&s;tion?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012739_0015_0F8BEA9676D8B1F8">
It would &s;urely be happy, a thing very de&s;irable, if all in vi&s;ible covenant were fully di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;|charge every duty of the covenant, if they had ge|nerally &s;uch a heart in them as to give up them|&s;elves and their's intirely to God, not only in pri|vate, but al&s;o publicly, and to walk in all the com|mandments and or finances of the Lord blamele&s;s, and &s;o to have all occa&s;ion of di&s;pute removed out of the way. But &s;ince this cannot be expected in this imperfect &s;tate, &s;ince there are &s;uch different degrees of knowledge and grace, and all profe&s;&s;ors do not &s;ee their duty in the &s;ame point of light, or have not equal capacity to di&s;cern what is duty in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and what is not, it would not &s;urely be ami&s;s to grant &s;ome indulgence to &s;crupulous tender con&s;ciences, and to allow them to go on in the path of duty as far as their pre&s;ent light leads them, without &s;trictly obliging them to that, from which doubts and fears keep them off, hoping and praying, that God would in his own time and way &s;catter their doubts and di&s;&s;ipate their fears, and give them &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their du|ty and clearne&s;s of evidence, as would embolden their acce&s;s in full with comfort and joy. Whe|ther &s;uch indulgence or connivance be warrant|able or not is the point in debate. Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> holds the negative. I the affirmative.</P>

1. I &s;hall begin with OBSERVATIONS. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Thing I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, That the di&s;pute between us is not whether unregenerate per&s;ons ought to be <HI>knowingly</HI> admitted, but what <HI>evidence of regeneration</HI> the church ought to act upon. Since it will be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of any plan what&s;oever, that many unregenerate will in fact be admitted not only to own the covenant, but al&s;o to full communion; I inter&s;per&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age here and there to abate Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s <HI>horrors</HI> at the very thoughts of an unregenerate per&s;on's coming. And now in&s;tead of making &s;uch u&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ages as I intended, he carefully culls them out to prove that I hold, the church ought knowingly to ad|mit unregenerates, or that baptized per&s;ons have a right to church-privileges, let their lives and be|havior be what they will. Whether <Q>this be fair or manly let the world judge.</Q> I &s;ay with him, if the church can certainly prove unregeneracy upon any (which mu&s;t be done by the life and con|ver&s;ation) let them be excluded from any privilege although baptized.

Every baptized per&s;on has a right to be treated as a chri&s;tian, if their general conduct be not incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tianity.

A judg|ment of <HI>rational charity</HI> may be left for others.

<P>If there be any weight in this &s;ort of rea&s;oning, then &s;urely baptized per&s;ons of regular conver&s;a|tions cannot ju&s;tly be excluded from owning the covenant, and bringing their children, whenever they de&s;ire it; they have a right to demand it as members, and none have a right to deny them.</P>

But this is a fault, that he is guilty of in a high degree.

<P>The chief that I &s;aid in the other view of the que&s;tion was, that if candidates acted con&s;cienci|ou&s;ly in what they did, if they come out of a &s;en&s;e of the command, and if (as far as they knew their own hearts) they were &s;incere in what they pro|fe&s;&s;ed, though they could not &s;ay it was a gracious &s;incerity, that was &s;ufficient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And mu&s;t he not of nece&s;&s;ity go upon the &s;ame plan, if certainty be not required?

<P N="3">3d. I ob&s;erve, That it is nece&s;&s;ary to make a di&s;|tinction re&s;pecting per&s;ons right in the &s;ight of GOD. This right is to be taken in a two-fold &s;en&s;e. 1&s;t. A right to outward privileges. 2d. A right to &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> denies the right of unre|generate per&s;ons in the &s;ight of God in any &s;en&s;e. And &s;ays, I contradict my&s;elf in implicitly intimat|ing that they have. But in this I think he goes too far. As to &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings we certainly agree; but with re&s;pect to outward privileges, I &s;ee no ab&s;urdity or contradiction in a&s;&s;erting, that they have &s;ome right to them in the &s;ight of God; I
<PB N="23" REF="012739_0020_0F8BEAA1021080E0">mean a right &s;o far at lea&s;t, that he would be of|fended with his church, if they &s;hould exclude them without full evidence of their unregeneracy. The ca&s;e is plain with re&s;pect to infants; God knows that many of them are not regenerate, yet if children of the faithful, they mu&s;t be baptized upon pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure. And even in regard of the children of unregenerates, God calls them <HI>my children, the children that were born unto me.</HI> Ezek. xvi. 20, 21. which implies &s;ome right in the &s;ight of God to vi&s;ible privileges, if the parents were in vi&s;ible covenant and not regularly cut off. This &s;ugge&s;ts to me a thought of weighty con&s;ideration. What one in&s;tance of reproof do we find from <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI> to <HI>Malachi</HI> to any individual for <HI>bringing</HI> their children to circumci&s;ion, even in their mo&s;t lap&s;ed and degenerate &s;tate? And does not this prove to a demon&s;tration, that all vi&s;ible members had a right in God' &s;ight to circumci&s;e their children, or that he approved of their admini&s;tring the rite to them, though at the &s;ame time he di&s;approved of their formality and wrong ends in this and other duties? Further, may we not ju&s;tly a&s;k, Had not <HI>Judas</HI> a right to outward privileges in the &s;ight of Chri&s;t, as well as <HI>Peter?</HI> Would he have otherwi&s;e admit|ted him to the pa&s;&s;over, and it is thought by mo&s;t divines to the Lords &s;upper too? And would he have been offended with the other apo&s;tles, if upon &s;u&s;picion they had endeavored to exclude him till by &s;ome overt act he had plainly di&s;covered him|&s;elf, or till full proof appeared again&s;t him? And would God him&s;elf have <HI>baptized</HI> the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> of old <HI>in the cloud and in the &s;ea,</HI> if they had not &s;ome right to the <HI>vi&s;ible mark,</HI> as being a people whom he had taken into covenant with him&s;elf? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. Yea and does not Mr. <HI>R.</HI> him&s;elf a&s;&s;ert in his &s;urpri&s;ing comment on <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14. That God treats the church of the <HI>Jews</HI> as <HI>vi&s;ible &s;aints,</HI> becau&s;e of their covenant relation to him, (when in fact there was &s;carce a <HI>real &s;aint</HI> among them?) <HI>p.</HI> 55. And would he have done &s;o, if they had not &s;ome right in his &s;ight to vi&s;ible privileges and favors? Mr. <HI>R.</HI> then mu&s;t have recour&s;e to this di&s;tinction of a two-fold
<PB N="24" REF="012739_0021_0F8BEAA1C5964858">right, or he cannot &s;olve his own conce&s;&s;ion here; though he every where el&s;e heedle&s;sly confounds and blends the&s;e two rights together. And the like not attending to this di&s;tinction by others, has been the &s;ource of bitter contentions. But if men would but duely con&s;ider, I think none will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to a&s;&s;ert, that they have no right in the &s;ight of God to that which is given them by the church in direct con&s;equence of his commands. The <HI>&s;owing of tares</HI> in the <HI>go&s;pel kingdom</HI> is indeed &s;aid to <HI>be done by an enemy, i. e.</HI> the devil. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii 28. But this cannot he applied to tho&s;e that were bap|tized in infancy, of whom I am &s;pecially treating, becau&s;e they were not <HI>planted</HI> or <HI>&s;owed</HI> in the church by the devil, but by God's &s;pecial appointment, as being children of the faithful. And I hope they will not charge laxne&s;s on their maker. This makes way for a notable ob&s;ervation, that if tho&s;e even of the <HI>devil's &s;owing,</HI> viz. Tho&s;e that come at adult age merely for &s;ecular and carnal ends; I &s;ay, if the&s;e mu&s;t <HI>not be gathered or plucked up</HI> (without full proof appear again&s;t them.) v. 29. How much le&s;s mu&s;t they be &s;o, who are of <HI>God's own planting,</HI> and were admitted by his direct order? And if they mu&s;t be continued &s;till in the church, then church-privileges mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be their's too; and it will be right in the &s;ight of God and man to put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, whenever a&s;ked for. Their right indeed in the view of the church goes further than this, and is more exten&s;ive than their right before God; for in the latter ca&s;e, their right is confined merely to things outward and vi&s;ible; but in regard of the church, they have not only a right to outward privileges, but to &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings (in the judgment of rational chari|ty.) Here I apprehend lies the proper difference between their right in the &s;ight of God and the church, or in <HI>&s;oro eccle&s;iae.</HI></P>
<P>But if they have &s;uch a right in the &s;ight of God, does not this militate with what is &s;aid under the la&s;t head? I an&s;wer no, becau&s;e though they have a right to come as members, yet they have no right to come in a <HI>wrong manner:</HI> And as far as they are
<PB N="25" REF="012739_0022_0F8BEAA278E1D038">de&s;titute of go&s;pel principles and ends, &s;o far they offend God in this or any other duty. But then it mu&s;t be remembred, that this offence is no &s;o great as a total neglect, if a man acts con&s;cienciou&s;ly in the affair. <HI>Jehu</HI> was commi&s;&s;ioned, yea commanded by God to <HI>root out Ahab</HI>'s <HI>vile race;</HI> I <HI>Kings</HI> xiii. And he did right in doing it; yet he had no right to do it in a wrong manner, <HI>i. e.</HI> with a murderous heart; and therefore while he is rewarded for the <HI>act,</HI> he is puni&s;hed for his <HI>evil intent, Ho&s;</HI> i, 4. But it is evid|ent his &s;in would have been greater if he had whol|ly forborn to act. This may &s;erve as an illu&s;tration in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. My</P>
<P N="4">4th. OBSERVATION or remark is, That &s;everal material things in the E&s;&s;ays remain untouched. I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That his &s;cheme was incumbred with the &s;ame difficulty as mine. He had propo&s;ed this expedient, namely, to admit candidates under &s;cruple to full communion, and then to di&s;pen&s;e with their imme|diate attendance at the Lord's table, till their &s;cru|ples were removed. This I &s;aid was a half-way prac|tice, a dividing the &s;eals, a tolerating per&s;ons in liv|ing in the neglect of the holy &s;upper, as much as the other practice. And if the one was unwarrant|ed by &s;cripture, the other was equally &s;o. And what does he &s;ay to obviate the difficulty? Why nothing, or wor&s;e than nothing. "Let us wait on them, &s;ays he, as members in covenant, and not as half mem|bers." <HI>p.</HI> 74. A mo&s;t &s;urprizing &s;peech! as if there were &s;ome members not in covenant, or that being members and being in covenant, were not &s;ynony|mous terms. What is the plain import of his words (&s;aving the non&s;en&s;e) but this? "Let us wait on them as perjured per&s;ons, that having covenanted or promi&s;ed to come imediately, yet &s;tay away; and not as per&s;ons that have made no &s;uch promi&s;e." A notable &s;olution truly! I leave it to the readers animadver&s;ion, with adding, that it appears to me impo&s;&s;ible, a man &s;hould con&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;cru|ple the pre&s;ent practice, and yet come into Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s expedient. There is no real difference between the one and the other; all the difference lies

<P N="3">3d.

Yea, he in effect grants, that explicit covenanting is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary: For in one place he &s;eems to di&s;like any thing, that "looks like a double admi&s;&s;ion into the church of Chri&s;t." And in another tells us, "that when per&s;ons are admitted into the church of Chri&s;t, they are admitted once for all:" Which if it be the ca&s;e, what need they be admitted over again, after they have been actually received into the church in their infancy? <HI>Ur&s;in,</HI> one of the au|thors Mr. <HI>R.</HI> quotes, &s;ays, <HI>To be born in the church, &s;erv|eth to the infants in &s;tead of their profe&s;&s;ion</HI> p. 414. and again, <HI>To be born in the church is to infants in&s;tead, and in place of profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> p. 420.</P>

<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a public explicit covenanting was required of the <HI>jews</HI> every &s;even years, what does it prove?

He grants, that infants baptized are <HI>"proper members;"</HI> yet when they grow up and declare that they &s;tand to their parent's act, they are but <HI>half-members:</HI> So that it &s;eems by renewing covenant, they lo&s;e <HI>half</HI> their member&s;hip. A poor encorage|ment truely to the renewing covenant, and they had much better let it alone. Or if he &s;uppo&s;es this half-member&s;hip to commence from their infancy; how could he in any &s;en&s;e call them "proper mem|bers?" A half-member, is not a proper member, but a mon&s;ter. And for a church to bring forth half-members, would be as mon&s;trous in the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, as for a woman to bring forth a half child into the natural world. And &s;uch births, I believe, would never have been heard of in the chri&s;tian church, had it not been for Dr. <HI>B&mdash;y</HI>'s fertile in|vention. Upon the whole, here, I think I have a a right to demand of them, either to prove that member&s;hip is a <HI>gradual</HI> growing, increa&s;ing thing, or to lay a&s;ide this ab&s;urd way of expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>half-members,</HI> &amp;c.

The ground I went upon was &s;o plain, that he that runs might read. The main argument for infant bapti&s;m is this, that the parents are vi&s;ibly in covenant with God, and that God grants the &s;ame right to their children in the <HI>grand charter, Gen.</HI> xvii. So that if the parent be in cove|nant, the children are &s;o too, and con&s;equently ought to have the &s;eal of the covenant. This I appli|ed to the pre&s;ent controver&s;y; the parents in que&s;tion are in vi&s;ible covenant; and if &s;o, the children are &s;o likewi&s;e; and con&s;equently ought to have the &s;eal. If the argument was conclu&s;ive in the one ca&s;e, it was certainly &s;o in the other. And therefore to deny the validity of this way of argu|ing, was to undermine the very foundation of in|fant-bapti&s;m. To this nothing is &s;aid, neither is the bapti&s;m of infants accounted for, on any other footing, which he ought to have done if he de&s;ign|ed to invalidate my argument. It is an acknow|ledged point with all <HI>paedo-bapti&s;ts,</HI> that infants are always members together with their parents; that there is a nece&s;&s;ary connection between the mem|ber&s;hip of the one and the other: Therefore none can ju&s;tly deny infants the &s;eal in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, unle&s;s they deny infant-member&s;hip, or the conti|nuance of it at adult age.</P>
<P>Here is a proper place to remind him of Mr. <HI>Mit|chel's</HI> argument, with which I begin my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ays, and which he does not think proper directly to conte&s;t. <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>1&s;t.

<P N="8">8th. I ob&s;erved, that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily run in|to the plan of the <HI>&s;eparates,</HI> if he treats tho&s;e whom he acknowleges proper members in this manner.
<PB N="33" REF="012739_0030_0F8BEAADE4FEA460">(See at large in the E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 7. and el&s;ewhere.) And does he clear him&s;elf of this? not a word tend|ing that way.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I find he takes not the lea&s;t notice of my "long &s;tring of arguments" for infant member&s;hip in one view of them. <HI>p.</HI> 53. They were calculated to prove, not only that they were proper members when fir&s;t baptized, but that they <HI>continued</HI> &s;uch when they grew up. That they did not grow out of the church, but that their infant member&s;hip remained in full force, till regularly cut off: and that of con&s;equence he was wrong in denying them the privileges belonging to members as &s;uch, when|ever a&s;ked for. With re&s;pect to this there is a deep &s;ilence. I now proceed to a,</P>
<P N="5">V. General ob&s;ervation, that he makes &s;uch con|ce&s;&s;ions as de&s;troy his whole &s;cheme.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. He grants, that baptized per&s;ons are mem|bers, yea "proper members." Why then will he not treat them as members? why will he not allow them the privileges of members? Member&s;hip and privilege are in&s;eparable; being in covenant and the privileges of the covenant always go together, as far as the capacity of the &s;ubject will allow, and they ought to be granted as far as they are a&s;ked for. There is no way to get over this but by &s;ay|ing, that their member&s;hip is wholly lo&s;t; that it is forfeited &s;ome way or other; and that of con&s;e|quence they are as much <HI>without,</HI> as if they had never been baptized. Indeed he &s;ometimes hints, that this is the ca&s;e: but why does he not directly &s;peak out, if he be of that mind? and why does he not call the church together to di&s;cipline them and pa&s;s &s;entence again&s;t them in form, as he ought to do, if their member&s;hip be wholly &s;or|feited? but it &s;eems he rather choo&s;es to act, as if they were neither <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without;</HI> he will nei|ther receive them nor ca&s;t them off: but leaves them as it were, &s;u&s;pended between heaven and hell, as if they belonged to neither; or if (as half-members) half of them belonged to God's, and half to the devil's kingdom.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="34" REF="012739_0031_0F8BEAAEC7528EB8">
2d. He grants, "that real good chri&s;tians may be u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der &s;cruples of con&s;cience about the Lord's &s;upper." And that the&s;e &s;cruples may be lawfully indulged. <HI>p.</HI> 38.41.74. And if they may be indulg|ed in one ca&s;e, why not in another! if on his plan, why not on ours?</P>
<P N="3">3d.

Well then per&s;ons baptized may partake of <HI>&s;ome privileges</HI> without coming to the Lord's table. And of of &s;ome, why not of others? if they may claim the church's watch for them&s;elves, why not put their children under the &s;ame watch? if they have a peculiar right to the church's prayers, why not rightfully a&s;k the &s;ame prayers for their children as being part of them&s;elves, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> it &s;eems divides privileges, and we have as much right to do it as he; and he is &s;elf-condemned, if he holds the unlawfulne&s;s of it.</P>
<P N="4">4th. He grants, that a baptized per&s;on (if he lays no bar in his own way) may demand rightfully one privilege, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord's-&s;upper.

<P N="6">VI. Another thing ob&s;ervable is that his plan nece&s;&s;arily runs him into &s;everal ab&s;urdities. Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> ob&s;erves of the oppo&s;ite party in his time, "that to maintain their &s;cheme they are forced to run into &s;everal ab&s;urdities:" from whence he ju&s;tly infers, that it could not be of God: for "truth is always con&s;i&s;tent." The &s;ame I ob&s;erve with re|&s;pect to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> I &s;hall now mention two or three, leaving the re&s;t to be taken notice of el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That there are &s;ome in covenant, that have no right to the privileges of the covenant, when as they are in&s;eparable, as I have already noted.
<PB N="35" REF="012739_0032_0F8BEAAF552C1EC8">How ab&s;urd would it be to &s;ay, that an incorporat|ed member of civil &s;ociety had no right to the privileges of the &s;ociety? &s;uch right is e&s;&s;ential to the very idea of member&s;hip. The &s;ame ab&s;urdi|ty they are guilty of in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Accord|ing to them there is very little or no difference at all between a baptized and unbaptized per&s;on: they can claim no more privilege than the unbap|tized; they mu&s;t be as &s;trictly examined; they mu&s;t pa&s;s through all the &s;ame formalities, in or|der to be received into the church, or to <HI>enter into covenant</HI> (as their phar&s;e is, not <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> which way of expre&s;&s;ion they carefully avoid) as the other. They have no more ground to expect or hope for divine influence (at lea&s;t if their parent be unregenerate) than the other. Well therefore may we put the que&s;tion, what advantage of cir|cumci&s;ion? or what privilege accrues to them by being baptized?</P>
<P N="2">2d. Another mo&s;t gro&s;s, glaring ab&s;urdity is, that the bapti&s;m of the children of unregenerates is "a MERE NULLITY." <HI>p.</HI> 48.&mdash;I was a&s;toni&s;hed when I read this: it is a po&s;ition I believe that was never before heard of in the chri&s;tian church, except from profe&s;&s;ed <HI>anabapti&s;ts.</HI> What! was the circum|ci&s;ion of <HI>A&s;a, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> (the children of unregerate men) a mere nullity? I know they did not think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o; neither (to &s;peak with reverence) did God him&s;elf think &s;o.</P>
<P>If this extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion be true: then 1&s;t. All di&s;tinction between the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible church is di&s;troyed; yea, the former is intirely an|nihilated; nothing done in it being of any real validity, as it &s;tands contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the latter; nothing is left but a heap of <HI>nullities</HI> from the beginning to end. This confounding all di&s;|tinction between the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible church I formerly noted in the E&s;&s;ays. And now he is plea&s;ed to confirm it: and that not only in this pa&s;&s;age, but in what preceeds. There he utterly denies any promi&s;es made to the vi&s;ible church collectively con&s;idered, and con&s;ines them <HI>only</HI> to the <HI>believing</HI> part of the church. <HI>The promi&s;e is to you

What a &s;trange and new con&s;truction of the text is here? what bu&s;ine&s;s had he to apply the&s;e words to true believers, invi&s;ible members only? was not the apo&s;tle preaching to <HI>unconverted jews?</HI> and did he not addre&s;s them merely as members of the <HI>vi&s;ible church?</HI> as &s;uch he tells them, that <HI>the promi&s;e was to them and to their children:</HI> and in the &s;ame manner it belongs to the vi&s;ible church to the end of time, and not to the believing part only.

And yet Mr. <HI>R.</HI> boldly a&s;&s;erts, that "there are no promi&s;es in the book of God" to the vi&s;ible church, but that they all belong to the church invi&s;ible, and to that only. "And on the&s;e principles, he &s;ays, &s;ome rational as well as &s;criptural account may be given of infant bapti&s;m." And on the&s;e principles I &s;ay, not only infant, but all bapti&s;m is impracticable and without foundation; it being impo&s;&s;ible to tell who are members of the invi&s;ible church, real believers, without an immediate revela|tion from heaven. 2d. If this a&s;&s;ertion be true, what a dilemma are all baptized in infancy brought into? in what inextricable difficulties are they in|volved? who of us can &s;ay, that our bapti&s;m was not a mere nullity, a nothing? we may indeed have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty for our parents, and verily hope they were c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted: but how can we certainly know it? and without &s;uch knowledge, how can we plead for covenant ble&s;&s;ings on their account? how can we u&s;e it as an argument for &s;pecial grace, as <HI>Ephraim</HI> did? <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 18. What a mockery to plead a mere nullity? or mu&s;t we come with an <HI>if;</HI> "if they were converted, Lord, grant us the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If not, we have no more to &s;ay; we a&s;k only for <HI>uncovenanted</HI> mercies?" 3d. Upon the &s;ame prin|ciple, it will follow, that the bapti&s;m admini&s;tred by unregenerate mini&s;ters is a mere nullity: as

The right on both &s;ides mu&s;t be merely vi&s;ible and <HI>nominal,</HI> not <HI>real.</HI> And what a wilderne&s;s will this lead us into? 4th. Accord|ing to this principle, the bapti&s;m of <HI>Luther, Calvin</HI> and all the other fir&s;t reformers, received in the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> was a mere nullity; con&s;equently they ought to be looked upon as unbaptized per|&s;ons. How then can our bapti&s;m received from them be of any validity? for no unbaptized per&s;on can baptize another. Well then it is come to this at la&s;t, that there is no true bapti&s;m in the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> world. Why then do we &s;o earne&s;tly contend about <HI>nothing.</HI> 5th. If this be the ca&s;e, bapti&s;m ought to be reiterated upon parents di&s;covering their unregeneracy, as is often the ca&s;e. If it be a thing of nought, a mere nullity, it mu&s;t &s;tand for nought, and re-baptization is nece&s;&s;ary. Or if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has a faculty of turning <HI>nothing</HI> into <HI>&s;omething,</HI> the world would be obliged to him for the di&s;co|very.</P>
<P>Upon the whole here, if this po&s;ition be true, in|fant bapti&s;m is a matter of &s;uch uncertainty view|ed in every light, that I &s;hould think it be&s;t for every one to be re-baptized at adult age: or rather, that no infants &s;hould be baptized at all. For there is no po&s;&s;ible way to a&s;certain it to them, that their bap|ti&s;m was not a mere nullity, <HI>i. e.</HI> a nothing, a &s;hadow, a vanity&mdash;of no more real validity, than the bap|tizing of <HI>bells</HI> or a piece of wood in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church.</P>

<P N="7">VII. General OBSERVATION, that really after all this bu&s;tle about evidences; what has he more up|on his plan than mine? if he differs from me about evidences, he ought to have a&s;certained par|ticularly wherein the difference lies and &s;et down with preci&s;ion what evidences were ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and that in the <HI>low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> degree, and not have muffled him&s;elf up in &s;hade and ob&s;curity, and le&s;t the matter in &s;uch uncertainty and confu&s;ion as he has done. This general loo&s;e handling the point has a tendency to make common people think, that he is more for <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>holine&s;s</HI> than others: whereas if he had come to particulars, it would have appeared that he contended about no|thing. But what evidences are to be had in the ca&s;e? is it profe&s;&s;ion or a&s;&s;erting to the covenant? the evidence is equal on both &s;ides. Is it relations? the&s;e are ca&s;t out by &s;ome leaders in his plan; and he him&s;elf acknowledges, that they are not nece&s;|&s;ary to the right con&s;titution of a church. <HI>p</HI> 63. Though he herein departs from the original plan, upon which the&s;e churches were founded, which he imputes to us as a crime. But what, though rela|tions be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, yet they are &s;till
<PB N="39" REF="012739_0036_0F8BEAB3CA253AA0">u&s;ed among us; and as long as they are &s;o they will be &s;ome help to the church in forming a judgment of charity. What always? are not the&s;e relations &s;ometimes weak and imperfect, and contain little or nothing of experimental religion? are they not at other times &s;uch o&s;tentations things, as &s;erve ra|ther to prejudice than help forward chri&s;tian cha|rity? what mu&s;t be done in this ca&s;e? would not he be thought a &s;trange member that &s;hould object merely on &s;uch an account? mu&s;t he not have &s;omething to allege again&s;t the life and conver&s;a|tion, or his objection would be taken no notice of? well then it is plain that the life and conver&s;ation is the grand criterion the chief evidence after all to regulate the church's proceedings. But how much of this mu&s;t be known before I can li&s;t up my hand for a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;on's admi&s;&s;ion! re&s;pecting &s;ome, the church in general may have full know|ledge; their lives are &s;o exemplary, as carries full conviction in the con&s;ciences of all. But how often is it otherwi&s;e in regard of others? how little is known of many candidates by the generality of the church? e&s;pecially in &s;uch great towns as this? and mu&s;t they not of nece&s;&s;ity go upon negative evidences in many ca&s;es? at lea&s;t many individuals of the church mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do &s;o. The mo&s;t they can &s;ay is, that they never heard any thing ami&s;s of the candidates. And &s;ometimes they cannot &s;ay &s;o much as that, having heard-&s;everal things ami&s;s, though for want of proof or not looking upon it as a cen&s;urable evil, they do not think proper to al|lege it as a bar. I am &s;ure, that as to half that have been admitted into our communion, I have had nothing but negative evidence, ex|cept their relation or con&s;enting to the cove|nant. And the &s;ame may many others &s;ay. And what had Mr. <HI>R</HI> but negative evidences about us when he fir&s;t &s;ettled here? and yet he ventured to covenant with us <HI>i e.</HI> to receive us as chri&s;tians, as well as we him. Now if negative evidences be &s;ufficient with re&s;pect to communicants; why not &s;ufficient likewi&s;e for his other "proper members?" are greater evidences required of the&s;e minors,
<PB N="40" REF="012739_0037_0F8BEAB488973418">than of grown members? but the&s;e were once ad|mitted upon a profe&s;&s;ion of grace or relation of ex|periences. What in tho&s;e churches, that were founded upon Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s plan? and yet he owns he will receive &s;uch to communion if they be oc|ca&s;ionally with us or &s;hould &s;ettle among us. <HI>p.</HI> 63. But have not the&s;e per&s;ons &s;omething <HI>more</HI> than ne|gative evidence, if that be requi&s;ite? do not they offer to renew covenant publicly? and is not this the main evidence they build upon? is not this profe&s;&s;ion the all in all with them? (See Mr. <HI>Green</HI>)</P>
<P>But this they do not do under&s;tandingly, believ|ingly, if they will come no further, this is all hypo|cri&s;y if they do not come in full. How dare he &s;ay this, when at the &s;ame time he grants, it may be the ca&s;e with &s;ome &s;incere &s;ouls? did he find it &s;o with tho&s;e whom he admitted? then he is &s;elf-condemned. Is it the ca&s;e with other mini&s;ters? they will not own it. Upon the whole here, will he, dare he &s;ay, "that negative evidence (that the church knows nothing ami&s;s of them) is no evidence at all" with re&s;pect to communicants: what more is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the <HI>continuation</HI> of their mem|ber&s;hip? and may not the &s;ame be &s;aid of other members, that if the church knows nothing e&s;&s;en|tially ami&s;s of them, their member&s;hip &s;till conti|nues, and they ought to be treated as members: there is no way to get rid of this way of rea&s;oning, but by acting upon the &s;eparates plan. Or mu&s;t we do as he propo&s;ed at our meeting with &s;ome bre|thren la&s;t year, namely, "for every member to go and di&s;cour&s;e per&s;onally with candidates upon their being propounded, in order to obtain full &s;a|tisfaction: this, he &s;aid, was our expre&s;s duty." But I believe he will find few of his mind in the country: &s;uch a laborious ta&s;k being incompatible with our other duties, as well as ab&s;urd in it&s;elf. My</P>

Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;tumbles at the very thre&s;h-hold; even at fir&s;t &s;etting out, before he had got three pages there are three notable mi&s;takes, if not more. In <HI>p</HI> 1. he tells us, that he always had &s;cruples about the practice; or, to u&s;e his own words. <Q>The practice has EVER appeared to me attended with &s;ome difficulties, which I could not ea&s;ily get over; however, not attending &s;o thoroughly to the arguments that were u&s;ed in &s;upport of this &s;cheme, as I endeavored to do &s;ince, and being <HI>educated</HI> in the practice, I did <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to it here for a number of years after I was ordained; though &s;till not without &s;ome <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> How will the reader be a&s;toni&s;hed when I tell him, that previous to Mr <HI>R</HI>'s &s;ettlement, he was di&s;cour&s;ed with by a number of the brethren (and they were the more critical with him, becau&s;e he came from a colony where their di&s;cipline &s;omewhat differs from ours) and he was told the con&s;titution of the church &s;tep by &s;tep, and he appeared cordially and fully to join with us in every thing; and par|ticularly as to this practice he expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction</HI> (and if he had not done &s;o, he would ne|ver have been &s;ettled here) &s;aying, "that he look|ed upon it as &s;criptural, that his father was in it, that he thought it intirely right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" But now it &s;eems he &s;crupled it <HI>ever,</HI> and <HI>&s;ubmitted</HI> to it with <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> for a number of years, even from the very time of his ordination. How can the&s;e things be reconciled? could a man of &s;incerity &s;ay, that he was intirely &s;atisfied with a practice, when he had latent &s;cruples in his mind, whether it were lawful or no? how needle&s;sly has he here expo&s;ed him&s;elf? I am &s;ure it affords not the lea&s;t advantage to his cau&s;e to tell the world, that he always had doubts about it; he had much better have kept them to him&s;elf. But I &s;uppo&s;e he does it to avoid the imputation of <HI>fic|klene&s;s,</HI> or toward off the charge of <HI>arminiani&s;m</HI> I had brought again&s;t him for holding to this practice for his fir&s;t nine years. But, <HI>incidit in &s;cyllam, qui vult,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But how comes he finally to get rid of his doubts, and to be fixed in the negative &s;ide of the que&s;tion?
<PB N="42" REF="012739_0039_0F8BEAB5F99B44C8">here is another &s;tumble. He tells us, "&s;uch force his &s;cruples had upon him, that at length he de|termines to &s;tudy the point more clo&s;ely, and for that end procured what authors <HI>he could</HI> on both &s;ides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" A good method &s;urely, but how does he manage in it? he fir&s;t manife&s;ted his di&s;like of the practice to one of our deacons, as he tran&s;iently met him on the road, the &s;ame day with our &s;acramental lecture; and appeared fully determined telling him in expre&s;s terms, that he would never baptize ano|ther upon the old plan; and was all on high to &s;top the church after lecture, to have the practice ca&s;t out at once. The deacon with much difficulty di&s;|&s;uaded him from &s;uch a ra&s;h and precipitant pro|cedure. In further di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> owned it was Dr. <HI>B&mdash;y</HI>'s <HI>dialogue</HI> that had convinc|ed him, and withal &s;aid that there was an an&s;wer publi&s;hed, but he had not yet &s;een it. He al&s;o owned, that he had not read the <HI>&s;ynod</HI>'s re&s;ult, and indeed &s;eemed to know nothing about it, when the deacon recommended it to his peru&s;al. And as for other anci|ent authors on the &s;ubject, it is manife&s;t from his book and otherways, that he never read Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> which even lay in his way: and the authors on the other &s;ide, as <HI>I. Mather,</HI> pre&s;ident <HI>Wad&s;worth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> &amp;c. I know he had never &s;een them, till long after the matter was brought into public. I put the two fir&s;t of the&s;e authors into his hands, and de&s;ired him to read them attentively: he took them with much &s;eeming indifference&punc; and carried them home. Sometime after being at his hou&s;e, I found, in&s;tead of giving Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> a diligent peru&s;al, he was only turning over the book, to cull out pa&s;&s;ages that he thought favored his &s;cheme; &s;o he declared him&s;elf. And whether he ever read the other at all, I can not &s;ay. Is this the man that had &s;o carefully (as well as prayerfully) &s;tudied the point "for many months?" he could read Mr. <HI>B&mdash;y</HI>'s <HI>dialogue</HI> in half an hour. I know he has &s;ince procured the <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> writers on both &s;ides, but he was, it &s;eems, &s;et|tled before, and declared him&s;elf to be &s;o, upon the bare peru&s;al of the <HI>dialogue.</HI> A book that appears to me the lea&s;t calculated to bring conviction, of al|mo&s;t

The deacon told Mr. <HI>R.</HI> he wondered how he could be convinced by &s;o week a piece, which he thought he could fully an&s;wer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He again &s;tumbles and blunders &s;trangely in <HI>p.</HI> 2. He appears very angry at me about the word <HI>&s;tre|nuous.</HI> How in the name of common &s;en&s;e he could mi&s;take me thus, "I cannot imagine." All I a&s;|&s;erted was, that he was <HI>&s;trenuous</HI> on the negative &s;ide of the que&s;tion. (E&s;&s;ays, 1&s;t leaf.) And if he was not &s;o, what means his book?&mdash;What means all his management for two or three years pa&s;t? but he turns it, contrary to all the rules of rea&s;on, that I charge him with being <HI>&s;trenuous to have church-meet|ings.</HI> I never thought him &s;o; but rather believe he either de&s;igned to lay a&s;ide the practice by his &s;ole authority, or expected the church would give it up at a word's &s;peaking out of complai&s;ance to him. This perhaps he would have thought "po|lite."</P>
<P>Another blunder exactly of the &s;ame tenor is about the <HI>highe&s;t evidence,</HI> p. 59. I was &s;peaking of the highe&s;t &s;ort of evidence <HI>before the church,</HI> he turns it the highe&s;t &s;ort of evidence <HI>in a per&s;ons own brea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>A like gro&s;s mi&s;take he makes about the word <HI>un&s;atisfied.</HI> p. 75. I &s;aid, that he was as much un&s;a|tisfied with the practice as ever. He turns it thus (even making a <HI>lye</HI> of it) that I &s;aid he was un&s;atis|fied with the meeting's being di&s;&s;olved. How could a man in his &s;en&s;es mi&s;take me thus? is he &s;o barren of matter to load me with reproaches, that he will even &s;train a point for it! I knew he was &s;o far from being un&s;atisfied with the di&s;&s;olution of the meet|ing, that it was what he labored for with all his might; and that not only per&s;onally, but by his emi&s;&s;aries, whom he &s;ent about to put the mem|bers into a flam&eacute; in order to effect it; they infu&s;|ing
<PB N="44" REF="012739_0041_0F8BEAB7AD480698">into people that it was not con&s;cience that ac|tuated us, but that all our aim in our oppo&s;ition was to get away Mr. <HI>R.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the beginning of the book&mdash;it is certainly a mi&s;take, not to &s;ay wor&s;e, to tell the world, that his book is but "a brief &s;ketch of the arguments he made u&s;e of in &s;upport of his opini|on." <HI>p.</HI> 3. All the church know the contrary. Here is much more delivered than ever the church heard before, and drawn up in a more copious and ma&s;terly manner. In fact, all the <HI>real</HI> arguments he brought before the church might be contained in a nut&s;hell; he never attempting to give a direct reply to any of my E&s;&s;ays (though he had a copy of the fir&s;t, and the &s;econd I &s;ent him above a week before it was read in public;) but the chief he did wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to read to us a long collection from Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Edwards, Bellamy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on,</HI> &amp;c. principally about quali|fications. But to as little purpo&s;e almo&s;t, as if he had read Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> about the Lord's-&s;upper &s;ole|ly and <HI>verbatim.</HI> If he thinks it was to the purpo&s;e, let him print it: I promi&s;e him to be a <HI>&s;ub&s;criber,</HI> if he will make no alterations or additions.</P>
<P>And as to his &s;ermons or "di&s;cour&s;es in public" mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 2. He handled the point merely in a <HI>ca&s;ai&s;tical</HI> manner, and did not &s;o much as touch the ca&s;e as it was a matter of <HI>church con&s;ideration.</HI> And even this he managed in &s;uch a manner, as gave almo&s;t general di&s;&s;atisfaction: people then (being free from <HI>prejudice</HI>) not being &s;o ready to &s;wallow every thing he &s;aid as go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Let us now touch a little on incon&s;i&s;tencies and contradictions.</P>
<P>And here more generally we may ob&s;erve, that in &s;ome places of his book baptized per&s;ons are proper members, in others but half members, and in others no members at all, having forfeited all their right by their <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> in not coming to the Lord's-table. <HI>p.</HI> 57. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet they may be good per&s;ons notwith&s;tanding, and de&s;erving the church|es forbearance. <HI>p.</HI> 38. Sometimes they are members, but not members in covenant. <HI>p.</HI> 74. As if being members and being in covenant were not words
<PB N="45" REF="012739_0042_0F8BEABF5BFC0C18">exactly of the &s;ame import. Pray what is it makes them members but their being in covenant?</P>
<P>But to be more particular.&mdash;The gentlemen in <HI>Connecticut</HI> expre&s;s them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as this, that they are in &s;ome &s;ort members, members in a &s;en&s;e, imperfect members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But Mr. <HI>R.</HI> who has a better talent in reconciling contradicti|ons, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf without boggling, that they are "proper members;" and yet denies them every privilege, that belongs to members as &s;uch. But the&s;e have forfeited their right by their di&s;obedi|ence in not coming to the Lord's-&s;upper. How &s;o! when they may be real good chri&s;tians at the &s;ame time, and ought to be u&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible ten|derne&s;s? what bitter water and &s;weet does he pour forth at once? to the &s;ame effect we find that for 6. or 7. pages together he endeavored with all his might to prove, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on to be a true chri&s;tian without coming to the Lord's-table. (<HI>p.</HI> 31&mdash;37.) And yet he kicks it all down at one &s;troke, even in one line, by granting, "that it was often the ca&s;e of good chri&s;tians to be kept away by &s;cruples." Yea, he actually canoni|zed one of this &s;ort in a funeral di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ince his change of principles.</P>
<P>This leads me to take notice of a clu&s;ter of con|tradictions blended or jumbled together. He &s;ays repeatedly, that per&s;ons who have only owned the covenant are but half-members. We have a num|ber of &s;uch, that owned the covenant either in his or Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> days, who have never yet of|fered them&s;elves to communion. How does Mr <HI>R.</HI> treat them? as half-members? as guilty of habi|tual continued neglect? as wilful renouncers and refu&s;ers? as wicked per&s;ons <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No; in&s;tead of this, the&s;e are all at once turned by him (without their a&s;king, without the churches con&s;ent) into <HI>members in full communion;</HI> and as &s;uch he baptizes their children without boggling or &s;cruple.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ugge&s;ts to my mind a <HI>lucky expedient,</HI> that may perhaps reconcile all. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> can get over the difficulty about tho&s;e who have <HI>already</HI> owned the covenant, by &s;aying, he <HI>looks upon them as members in full com|munion.</HI> Why can not he get over the difficulty the &s;ame way <HI>in futuro,</HI> by admitting per&s;ons to own the covenant, and then &s;aying <HI>they are in full communion!</HI> thus he and the church may jogg on together in harmony and peace.</NOTE> And
<PB N="46" REF="012739_0043_0F8BEAC06946F4A0">to render the incon&s;i&s;tence more compleat, when the&s;e new &s;ort of members in full communion ap|ply to be received to the Lord's-&s;upper (of which there has been two in&s;tances very lately) does he immediately receive them without further ceremo|ny, or a&s;k the church to do it? no; they mu&s;t needs be received in common form; be propounded for a fortnight, bring a relation, covenant anew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is a double, treble, yea, quadruple admi&s;&s;ion into the church of God.

Here is confu&s;ion upon confu&s;ion. Let us now attend to other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>We have often ob&s;erved, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> calls them "proper members" that have been baptized in in|fancy; yet of late he carefully avoids the old ex|pre&s;&s;ion of <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> when &s;uch apply at adult years; always u&s;ing that of <HI>entering into cove|nant,</HI> as if they were never in covenant before. See all over his book; and this is his general language in public, when any are propounded. I beg to know how they can <HI>enter</HI> upon a thing which (ac|cording to his own conce&s;&s;ion) they entered upon or were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of long before. This language imports, that they were never really in covenant till now. And there are many other pa&s;&s;ages in his book, that import the &s;ame thing, or that they were never members till this entrance we are &s;peaking of. The fourth argument <HI>p.</HI> 6. goes wholly
<PB N="47" REF="012739_0044_0F8BEAC099A85818">upon this &s;uppo&s;ition. He appears to di&s;like "any thing that looks like a double admi&s;&s;ion into the church of God." <HI>p.</HI> 3. He &s;ays, per&s;ons "are ad|mitted into the family of Chri&s;t once for all." <HI>p.</HI> 6. How can this be till this entrance? he &s;eems to fault me for calling baptized per&s;ons <HI>real members, compleat members.</HI> p. 9. 42. He mentions the&s;e phra&s;es with a &s;neer. He &s;peaks of them as <HI>not of the church. p.</HI> 74. And frequently calls their owning covenant an <HI>admi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as if their member&s;hip did not com|mence till now. How can all this be, if they were proper members when fir&s;t baptized?</P>
<P>Again, he &s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 3. "God's covenant people both under the old and new te&s;tament had no war|rant to make any exceptions or limitations, under any circum&s;tances or upon any pretence whatever." And again, <HI>p.</HI> 16. "no per&s;on, church or power on earth, can lawfully di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch an atten|dance." <HI>viz.</HI> on the Lord's-&s;upper. And yet he of|fered to make exceptions and limitations. Yea, he propo&s;ed to the church to pa&s;s an <HI>actual vote</HI> to di&s;|pen&s;e with candidates in ca&s;e of &s;cruple, if they would verbally con&s;ent to be called members in full communion. What a direct incon&s;i&s;tency is here? yea, he further &s;uppo&s;es, that per&s;ons in the dark may <HI>lawfully</HI> &s;tay away. And yet at the &s;ame time calls them renouncers, refu&s;ers, habitual neglecters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not to be tolerated, le&s;t we be partakers of other men's &s;ins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again, he &s;uppo&s;es all over his book, that tho&s;e who act upon my plan, are <HI>unconverted;</HI> he taxes them with "<HI>habitual and continual di&s;obedience</HI> to the ex|pre&s;s command of Chri&s;t:" <HI>p.</HI> 57. and yet &s;ays, the command was <HI>never</HI> given to <HI>them,</HI> but to others, <HI>viz.</HI> "to true di&s;ciples" or believers <HI>only. p.</HI> 45, 6.&mdash;Que|ry, how can per&s;ons be taxed with di&s;obedience to a command, that was never given to them? is it not an eternal rule, that where there is no law there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? tho&s;e indeed to whom the com|mand is given may be guilty of di&s;obedience, but tho&s;e to whom it is not given are no more concerned in it than if there was no command at all. How does he here relax the bonds of duty from the neck of
<PB N="48" REF="012739_0045_0F8BEAC2E1EBF9A8">&s;inners? if the command indeed were given to the <HI>vi&s;ible church,</HI> then all neglecters are guilty, but if the command only reaches <HI>invi&s;ible members,</HI> then it is they only that mu&s;t plead guilty or not guilty, all others have nothing to do with it. He may as well &s;ay, that infants are guilty of the breach of this com|mand.</P>
<P>Again, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>&s;aving ble&s;&s;ings</HI> are no more (no not &s;o much as conditionally) &s;ealed to the children of the faithful, if unconverted, than to <HI>jews, dei&s;ts and mahometans:</HI> p. 43. and yet he owns that there are <HI>gracious promi&s;es</HI> all over the bible con|cerning &s;uch. <HI>p.</HI> 48.</P>
<P>Further he &s;ays, "that owning the covenant is one of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn</HI> tran&s;actions on this &s;ide death," and that "coming to the Lord's table is a <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> tran&s;action:" <HI>p.</HI> 36. and yet, that per&s;ons equally own the covenant every time they come, as much as they did at fir&s;t. The &s;ame he &s;ays of other covenant tran&s;actions. <HI>p.</HI> 6. How then can there be any <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> in the ca&s;e? or is it a le&s;&s;er tran&s;|action to own the covenant in <HI>deed</HI> than in <HI>words?</HI> would it be deemed a greater thing to <HI>accept</HI> a prince's invitation to dinner, than the <HI>actual dining</HI> with him?</P>
<P>Again, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;ays, that baptized per&s;ons have forfeited their right, if they do not come to the Lord's-table, and that they ought to be cen&s;ured; and yet will not &s;uffer them to come, if he thinks them unqualified, let them be ever &s;o inoffen&s;ive. unhappy ca&s;e, that they mu&s;t neither come nor not come.</P>
<P>Again, he dur&s;t not defend Dr. <HI>Bellamy's</HI> doc|trine, "that for a natural man to pretend to own the covenant, was to &s;in again&s;t God in a more provoking manner, than if he had committed drunkenne&s;s, fornication, and adultry." (E&s;&s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 68.) I &s;ay, he dur&s;t not defend this in direct terms, becau&s;e he knew it would render him obnoxion to his own party: yet he holds the &s;ame thing in effect all over his book. Why will not men hone&s;tly &s;peak out, but conceal them&s;elves in a &s;hade?</P>
<P>Again, he prayed again&s;t me and preached again&s;t me for the expo&s;ition I gave of the text; <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14.
<PB N="49" REF="012739_0046_0F8BEAC385A626D8">and &s;eems &s;till &s;urprized at it: while at the &s;ame time he expounds the text exactly as I did, name|ly, that it was an addre&s;s to the whole vi&s;ible church collectively con&s;idered, without any regard to their inward gracious &s;tate. <HI>p.</HI> 55. This is the very thing I aimed at, and indeed all that was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h my point, though perhaps not &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed as it might have been. The addre&s;s for certain included both regenerates and unregenerates, though very few of the former &s;ort among them at that time: they were generally corrupt; yet had not lo&s;t their member&s;hip re|ceived in infancy. This Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would not then al|low of, but led his people to think by his prayers and preaching, that the words were directed to true believers and to them only, and not to the whole church in general including unregenerates. But now he turns directly about, and fully joyns with me, and yet continues to fault me. How &s;ur|pri&s;ing is this?</P>
<P>Further, he taxes me with leaving the original plan of the fathers; and yet di&s;&s;ents from them as well as we: he pretends to honor them, yet leaves them. He differs from them in &s;everal particulars, two e&s;pecially.

</LIST></P>
<P>La&s;tly, he taxes me with u&s;ing pa&s;&s;ionate excla|mations to gain my point. And hath he not pa&s;|&s;ionate exclamations all over his book! Are they not inter&s;per&s;ed everywhere? &s;ee particularly from <HI>p.</HI> 23&mdash;26. and <HI>p.</HI> 32&mdash;35.</P>
<P>Thus I have pre&s;ented the reader "with a brief &s;ketch" of the blunderata and incon&s;i&s;tencies that abound in his book: "it would be endle&s;s to fol|low him in all." May I not ju&s;tly then conclude the head with his own words, which are much more applicable to him than to me. <HI>p.</HI> 41. <Q>Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent; therefore when a per&s;on ad|vances any &s;cheme or po&s;ition, and in his argu|ments to &s;upport it, is incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf,
<PB N="50" REF="012739_0047_0F8BEAC4356BDF70">it affords, at lea&s;t, a &s;trong pre&s;umption that his &s;cheme or po&s;ition is not true. Whether Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has not fallen into this difficulty in attempting to &s;upport his &s;cheme, I do, after pointing out the&s;e things (with others el&s;ewhere) leave the reader to judge.</Q></P>
<P>I now proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General HEAD, namely, to con&s;ider and an&s;|wer his objections, e&s;pecially tho&s;e contained in the fir&s;t part of his reply. I would ob&s;erve here in general, that I do not find any new objections in this place, which I had not before con&s;idered, but only the old expatiated and recited at greater length, but not with more clearne&s;s than before. His policy here is remarkable in treating the &s;ub|ject in a large declamatory diffu&s;ive way in order to captivate the vulgar, and even u&s;ing "pa&s;&s;ion|ate exclamations." But this method will not take with men of thought and penetration. Such up|on the re-peru&s;al of my book will find the main objections fully obviated already. But yet for the &s;ake of others. I think it nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome no|tice of his main pleas. His</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Objection is, "that there is no text in the whole word of God to ju&s;tify the practice, nor any example to warrant it." <HI>p.</HI> 3. How exactly does this tally with the words of an <HI>anabapti&s;t</HI> writer quoted by <HI>Ur&s;in?</HI> <Q>no opinion is to be received, whereof we have neither expre&s;s commandment or apparent example in the &s;cripture: but there is no commandment or example extant in &s;crip|ture for baptizing infants: wherefore the bap|tizing of infants is not to be permitted in the church." To which <HI>Ur&s;in</HI> an&s;wers, "God com|mandeth that all be baptized of what age, &s;ex, condition or &s;tate &s;oever, which pertain to the covenant and the church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> p. 419. This is full to the point; and it coming from one of Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s authorities (though it &s;eems at &s;econd hand) I hope it will have the more weight with him. Can he then &s;ay, that there are no texts to ju&s;tify the practice? are not tho&s;e &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, that prove the member&s;hip of the per&s;ons in que&s;|tion?
<PB N="51" REF="012739_0048_0F8BEAC4FAD25D68">for if members them&s;elves, their children are certainly &s;o too, (according to the divine con&s;tituti|on, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii.) and &s;o are intitled to the &s;eal. This is as &s;trong and conclu&s;ive a way of arguing as we can po&s;&s;ibly have for infant bapti&s;m; and indeed it is the main ground. And if he rejects it as in|&s;ufficient, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become an <HI>anabapti&s;t;</HI> not only joining with them in requiring an expre&s;s text, but in all parts of their &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Further, he &s;ays there is no <HI>example.</HI> I think we have a direct example in the ca&s;e of <HI>lepers,</HI> which were (in mo&s;t ca&s;es) excluded the pa&s;&s;over for life, were they ever &s;o gracious inwardly; yet their chil|dren were not excluded circumci&s;ion. And when|ever a per&s;on was otherwi&s;e legally unclean, his attendence on the pa&s;&s;over was di&s;pen&s;ed with; but &s;till his children were to be circumci&s;ed. The ca&s;e is plain, the fir&s;t &s;eal was <HI>never</HI> to be omitted on any account whatever, where the parents were in coven|ant; but the other &s;eal was often omitted or di&s;pen&s;|ed with upon incidental accounts, and the two &s;eals were frequently divided. An example that I do not think unlawful for us to follow. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, that this <HI>legal uncleanne&s;s</HI> (which is excluded from the pa&s;&s;over) typified <HI>moral uncleanne&s;s</HI> under the go&s;pel; which ought to exclude equally now. What would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch an a&s;&s;erti|on? why, that <HI>moral uncleanne&s;s</HI> is a &s;ufficient bar from coming to the Lord's-&s;upper, but not from bringing their children to bapti&s;m, if they are vi&s;i|bly in covenant; as <HI>legal uncleanne&s;s</HI> debared from the &s;econd &s;eal, but not from the fir&s;t. And let them take the con&s;equence to them&s;elves, if they argue thus, (as Mr <HI>Edwards</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> actually do) It is their's, and not mine, though I can not &s;ee how they can get over it.</P>
<P>Another objection is, the <HI>indi&s;pen&s;iblene&s;s</HI> of the com|mand, <HI>do this, &amp;c.</HI> This is repeated over and over, and &s;eems his <HI>all in all,</HI> though I cannot &s;ee with what face he can plead it, when he actually offer|ed to di&s;pen&s;e with the command upon certain conditions. A di&s;pen&s;ation is as allowable upon our &s;cheme as his. And for my part I mu&s;t ac|knowlege,
<PB N="52" REF="012739_0049_0F8BEAC5D42282B0">that <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive</HI> precepts always appeared to me in a very different light. The latter have been often di&s;pen&s;ed with, but the former never. The &s;cripture abounds with in&s;tances of &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Su&s;pending the pa&s;&s;over and circumci&s;ion in the wilder|ne&s;s &s;eems only a prudential of the church, upon the account of their <HI>travelling circum&s;tances,</HI> as divines think. If God had particularly commanded it, it would no doubt have been recorded, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ets down commands for very minute things, as about fringes, the paddle, &amp;c. And if churches may upon occa&s;ion, and as particular cir|cum&s;tances occur, &s;u&s;pend a <HI>general</HI> attendance, they may as well &s;u&s;pend a <HI>particular</HI> one. In&s;tances of &s;uch ge|neral &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Lord's-&s;upper has been known in our days even for years, not only when a church has been without a pa&s;tor, but al&s;o when in divided broken circum|&s;tances.</NOTE> And if particular per&s;ons, through mi&s;takes or &s;cruples, deprive them&s;elves of the benefit of <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titutions,</HI> I dare not con|demn them to the pit of hell upon that account. St. <HI>Au&s;tin's</HI> &s;aying is mo&s;t true, <HI>not the want, but the contempt of ordinances condemneth.</HI> And that &s;aying of other divines is equally true, <HI>that the&s;e &s;pecial ordi|nances &s;erve not for the being, but the well being of a chri&s;ti|an.</HI> The <HI>habitual</HI> wilful <HI>neglect</HI> of them is certainly a very heinous &s;in; but if per&s;ons having a <HI>due value</HI> for &s;uch in&s;titutions, are kept away merely from fears that they have not the befitting and requi&s;ite qualifications, this I look upon rather as an <HI>infirmity,</HI> than a damnable offence.</P>
<P>Again, it is objected, "that this practice is of a very bad and dangerous tendency," and that it par|ticularly, "tends to promote a carele&s;s &s;ecure &s;pirit in candidates." <HI>p.</HI> 8.&mdash;QUERY, whether tho&s;e places where the practice is not allowed, have fewer in propotion of this &s;ecure carele&s;s &s;pirit than the places where it is received? let him a&s;k the mini|&s;ters, and they will tell him the rever&s;e: the pre|vailing &s;ecurity then mu&s;t not be a&s;cribed to this practice. And let him a&s;k them further, whether they have not rea&s;on to think, that many whom
<PB N="53" REF="012739_0050_0F8BEAC68A9B31D8">they have not over great charity for, have upon this very account come up in full, that otherwi&s;e would not, merely to get their children baptized.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved in my &s;econd E&s;&s;ay, <HI>p.</HI> 20. That mini|&s;ters refu&s;ing to receive them upon this plan, and yet urging them to come in full, had a much great|er tendency to promote this &s;ecure &s;pirit. To this he deigns not a word of an&s;wer. I would now ob|&s;erve further, that in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try, I never found <HI>one</HI> under conviction (among the many &s;cores I conver&s;ed with) who&s;e con&s;cience pricked them merely for not owning the covenant, but it was for their neglect of the Lord's-&s;upper; and to that many &s;eemed earne&s;tly de&s;irous of fly|ing as an <HI>a&s;ylum,</HI> to get ea&s;e to their wounded &s;pirits. And if they are admitted to that, there is much more danger of their re&s;ting there, than if they had only owned the covenant. In &s;hort, this objection and what is &s;aid under it, bewrays to me too much <HI>unacquaintedne&s;s</HI> or <HI>experience</HI> of the work|ings of the human mind under conviction, and is rather matter of theory than reality.</P>
<P>Again, he &s;ays, that <HI>John's</HI> bapti&s;m was not of &s;uch latitude as we plead for; but was confined to profe&s;&s;ing penitents. I an&s;wer, if he will be as large in admini&s;tring bapti&s;m, as <HI>John</HI> was, there are none I believe but would be content. The text &s;ays, <HI>all Judea and Jeru&s;alem went out to him, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins. Matt.</HI> iii. 5, 6. Will Mr. <HI>R.</HI> baptize any merely on &s;uch confe&s;&s;ion? no, &s;ays he; promi&s;es of amendment are implied, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace. Well, let it be &s;o (though the words do not directly imply it) all would be content &s;till. Would he bap|tize them or their children now? no, they mu&s;t make a profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;aving repentance.</HI> Well, but how can they profe&s;s it without they <HI>knew</HI> they had it! would he have them lye, or declare more than they know? no; it is &s;ufficient for them to &s;ay, that as far as they knew their own hearts they were &s;incere in <HI>confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins,</HI> &amp;c. If he would receive them now, where is the difference between him and me? It appears to me, that all <HI>John</HI> holds forth when he
<PB N="54" REF="012739_0051_0F8BEAC74363C088"><HI>preached the bapti&s;m of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> was, that repentance was nece&s;&s;ary in order to par|take of the <HI>&s;aving mercies</HI> of the covenant, or to ob|tain the <HI>&s;piritual good</HI> held forth in bapti&s;m; and that it cannot be ju&s;tly inferred from anything that is &s;aid, that he thought they were all real penitents whom he baptized: yea, the direct contrary appears, for he him&s;elf intimates, that many of them were but <HI>cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fy profe&s;&s;ors</HI> (as afterwards appeared). And therefore he exhorts them to exerci&s;e go&s;pel repent|ance, and not to re&s;t merely in the outward privi|lege, le&s;t their bapti&s;m &s;hould be of no avail. I would ob&s;erve further, that <HI>John</HI> does not erect a new church (the go&s;pel church was not erected till &s;ome time after) but &s;eems to baptize them as mem|bers already, or as part of the &s;tanding church of the <HI>jews:</HI> and it does not appear, neither is it pro|bable, that he rejected any that came, though he gave a &s;evere reproof to &s;ome &s;orts.</P>
<P>Further he objects, that we place too great a di&s;|tinction between bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper. I an&s;wer; this, the other &s;ide are e&s;pecially guilty of, who would not allow baptized per&s;ons any pri|vilege at all; whereas if they will but come to the Lord's-&s;upper, all privileges are their's and their children's forever.</P>
<P>A like objection is, that "I make <HI>lower qualificati|ons</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for bapti&s;m than for the Lord's-&s;up|per, which is quite wrong." <HI>p.</HI> 48, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He ought rather to have &s;aid <HI>lower dagrees</HI> of the &s;ame quali|fications. And is not this rea&s;onable? certainly &s;tronger language may be expected from <HI>grown men</HI> than from <HI>mere babes;</HI> from tho&s;e that have had &s;ome <HI>experience,</HI> than form tho&s;e that are ju&s;t come to the <HI>birth.</HI> To be &s;ure they can give a more full and &s;atisfactory evidence of their being in Chri&s;t after &s;ome experience, than when fir&s;t born into the world of grace. And in &s;ome ca&s;es their lives have been &s;o notorious, that though bapti&s;m can|not be denied to them when they come to us, as they did to <HI>John, confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins;</HI> yet it would not be proper immediately to receive them to the Lord's-table. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid re&s;pecting
<PB N="55" REF="012739_0052_0F8BEAC7F5C52EB8">per&s;ons gro&s;ly ignorant; when they come to know the fundamentals of religion, that there is a Savi|our, and ju&s;tification through him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and appear to receive it cordially, they are intitled to bapti&s;m: yet they ought not to be received to the other or|dinance, till better and more fully in&s;tructed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We find a plain di&s;tinction made between the <HI>&s;pou&s;e</HI> and <HI>the daughters of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Cant. v. and 6. though both within the pale of the church. The one were admitted to full privileges, the other not &s;o&mdash;which &s;eems to give a direct warrant to our practice.</P>
<P>Further, it is &s;aid, what &s;ignifies it to be &s;o &s;tre|nuous in the affair? what good will bapti&s;m do their children, if they be not good them&s;elves? it may be of &s;ome advantage indeed as to this world; it may take away their reproach. But of what advantage in the &s;ight of God? as they come with|out his leave, &s;o they will be &s;ent away with|out his ble&s;&s;ing; the bapti&s;m of &s;uch being a <HI>mere nullity</HI> with him, <HI>p.</HI> 48. This objection &s;ugge&s;ts a que&s;tion of weighty moment, what the real &s;itua|tion of a baptized child is, who&s;e parent is unre|generate let him be a communicant or otherwi&s;e? I have already endeavored to di&s;prove &s;uch a bap|ti&s;m's being a mere nullity. But of what real ad|vantage is it? I an&s;wer, much every way; if it be not a <HI>nullity</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;omething, i. e.</HI> an&s;wer &s;ome valuable end, and be of real u&s;e to the child. Sup|po&s;ing Mr. <HI>R.</HI> were <HI>right,</HI> that the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> were made only to the invi&s;ible church; yet God may fulfil them to the child for their pious grand pa|rents &s;ake, or for the &s;ake of &s;ome other godly pro|genitor (as was the ca&s;e of king <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI>) for the pro|mi&s;e runs to a thou&s;and generations. But if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> be <HI>wrong,</HI> as I think has been proved, and the <HI>pro|mi&s;e</HI> mentioned, <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 39. re&s;pects the church vi&s;i|ble, it may reach &s;uch a child as much as if his parents were really godly; and he has as good a right to plead it, as an argument for converting grace, as the child of the be&s;t &s;aint living. He hath been received into the church according to divine rules, and therefore hath ground to a&s;k for
<PB N="56" REF="012739_0053_0F8BEAC8B44F8E48">divine ble&s;&s;ings, as one of God's covenant children. Yea, I may add, that God may, and no doubt often does, ble&s;s the ordinance to a child, as being <HI>his own in&s;titution,</HI> though not for the parent's &s;ake; as common means are often ble&s;t to &s;inners that u&s;e them, as being means of God's appointment, though not for the &s;inners &s;ake. <HI>Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord, be a&s;hamed and confounded for your own ways, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, but for my own name &s;ake.</HI> Ezek. xxxvi, 22, 32. <HI>i. e.</HI> He does it for his own honor, and that he may grace his own in&s;titutions, without any regard to the &s;inner.</P>
<P>Again, he objects, that both ordinances are <HI>equal|ly &s;olemn;</HI> and a&s;ks upon it, why fears and &s;cruples do not operate as &s;trongly to keep from the one as from the other; e&s;pecially &s;ince owning the cove|nant (which is previous) is a <HI>&s;olemner thing</HI> than both. <HI>p.</HI> 36. The ab&s;urdity of the latter clau&s;e of the ob|jection has been already taken notice of. Let me an&s;wer to the fir&s;t part; &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the ca&s;e, that the two ordinances are equally &s;olemn, is there not &s;omething in human nature, that of|ten reluets (or is terrified) at one duty, yet not at another, though equally &s;olemn? and is Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;o little acquainted with the workings of the hu|man mind, as not to know it? it is really as &s;olemn a thing in it&s;elf con&s;idered, to approach Gord's throne in <HI>&s;ecret of family devotions,</HI> as at the Lord's-&s;upper: And yet Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would not him&s;elf won|der, that &s;ome will venture to <HI>pray,</HI> and yet not venture to the Lord's-&s;upper. An unaccountable fear, which they cannot &s;hake off, may often pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind, and &s;way it to forbear in one in|&s;tance; yet have no effect in another ca&s;e, though nearly parallel.

<P>Again, it is objected, that if we plead the exam|ple of the jewi&s;h church it proves <HI>too much,</HI> that <HI>&s;candalous per&s;ons</HI> ought to be admitted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which

<P>La&s;tly, another objection of the like &s;ort is his outcry. <HI>p.</HI> 32. "That it was as <HI>dark a day</HI> with re|&s;pect to religion as almo&s;t ever was known in this town, when this practice was brought in," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a dark time it &s;eems was the propere&s;t to in|troduce &s;uch a dark practice.

<P>I now come to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al HEAD, to con&s;ider his manner of treat|ing me both in relation to the general, and par|ticular controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IN general we may ob&s;erve the method of his book. He fir&s;t lays down arguments in proof of his plan; then con&s;iders them in objections, taking but little or no notice of me all this while, as if none of the&s;e objections were found in the E&s;&s;ay, but were found out by his own &s;agacity. And when he comes to &s;peak of the E&s;&s;ays, it &s;eems he finds nothing in them but a heap of ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bles and incon&s;i&s;tencies, of mi&s;repre&s;en&s;ations and unju&s;t charges, &s;carce wor|thy of his notice. In this contemptuous manner he treats me. And with the like contempt he hath treated me in his letters and otherwi&s;e during this controver&s;y. And the &s;ame &s;ort of treatment I had much experience of, during the fir&s;t &s;even years of his mini&s;try, as the whole pari&s;h do know, if they would te&s;tify, which gave great offence in the time of it. Of the&s;e things more hereafter.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the <HI>general controver&s;y.</HI> Here are three &s;ections, which I &s;hall con&s;ider di&s;tinct|ly. I begin with his 4th SECTION from <HI>p.</HI> 28, to <HI>p.</HI> 41.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 28. "I &s;tated the que&s;tion rightly, whether the <HI>half way practice</HI> of admitting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" I never &s;tated the que&s;tion &s;o It is an abomination to me. The phra&s;e half practice, half members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is entirely his own, and what he imported from <HI>Connecticut.</HI> It was never known or thought of in the&s;e parts, till he introduced it. And the fir&s;t coiners of the phra&s;e (who they were God knows) did it out of politic views: it being a common me|thod, when any have a mind to run down a cau&s;e, to brand it with &s;ome odious <HI>nick-name.</HI> This is the
<PB N="62" REF="012739_0059_0F8BEAD3AE7A4CD8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> here. The phra&s;e in my apprehen&s;ion in|volves &s;o much venom and malignity in it, that it is &s;trange any chri&s;tian &s;hould u&s;e it.</P>
<P>"The que&s;tion being thus rightly &s;tated (&s;ays he) I quickly ramble from it, and endeavor to e&s;tab|li&s;h another point." But how does he prove it? not by following me argument by argument, but by culling out a pa&s;&s;age here and there, without regarding what preceeded or followed. Fir&s;t a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age (E&s;&s;ay 1&s;t) <HI>p.</HI> 2. and then flying to <HI>p.</HI> 12. (E&s;&s;ay 2d.) I de&s;ire the reader to look into both tho&s;e pages, and they will plainly &s;ee how he abu&s;es me. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are, "neither does Chri&s;t &s;o much as intimate that they were graci|ous thereby letting us know, that it is vi&s;ible mem|ber&s;hip gives the right." "From whence we may infer that it is not contrary to the mind of God, that the children of per&s;ons unregenerate &s;hould have this ordinance admini&s;tred to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to him." What do the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions import more than this, that God expects and requires that his church treat all tho&s;e that are vi&s;ibly in covenant with him as proper members of his church, whether regene|rate or no, as long as they behave well. Does not Mr. <HI>R.</HI> hold this as well as I? and hath he not &s;e|veral pa&s;&s;ages to the like purpo&s;e? for he acknow|leges, that we have nothing to do with the heart. This fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age then being the only ramble he accu&s;es me of in the 1&s;t. E&s;&s;ay, and the &s;econd the only one in the 2d. E&s;&s;ay, (all comprized within the compa&s;s of 5 lines:) &s;urely all the re&s;t mu&s;t be to the point. Why then does not he attempt to an&s;wer it? as &s;urely he has not done. For my part, upon reviewing the piece, it appears to me, that in&s;tead of flying from the point, I &s;tick clo&s;e|ly to it. And here by the way, I would ob&s;erve how ea&s;y it is to an&s;wer any book what&s;oever, if it is &s;ufficient to pick out a pa&s;&s;age or &s;crap here and there (leaving out what preceeded or follow|ed) and then rack and mangle it to &s;peak what they plea&s;e. A man may go on an&s;wering to eter|nity at this rate.</P>

If he can prove, that the candidates <HI>neglect, i. e.</HI> &s;light and contemn the ordinance of the &s;upper, let them in God's name be kept off. This I ob|&s;erve is his common phra&s;e, not only in his title page, but throughout his whole book, to inflame people again&s;t me; &s;ometimes the word <HI>neglect</HI> only is u&s;ed; &s;ometimes <HI>habitual neglect</HI> (which is &s;tronger &s;till;) &s;ometimes <HI>renounce, refu&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> Sometimes it is <HI>allowed neglect and violation,</HI> a <HI>continu|ed neglect</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How can he tell that it will be a <HI>continued neglect,</HI> when fir&s;t admitted? mo&s;t of tho&s;e at <HI>Halifax,</HI> that owned the covenant, &s;oon came into full communion.

So far from this, that he calls them <HI>members in full communion,</HI> baptizes their children; yea, gives them the character of <HI>exemplary</HI> chri&s;tians; (ju&s;tly I tru&s;t as to mo&s;t of them, but incon&s;i&s;tently as to him&s;elf.)</NOTE> (always the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions he could invent) Yea, it comes at la&s;t to be down|right wickedne&s;s. <HI>p.</HI> 57. Thus blinding people with a notion, that I was for opening the door to the wor&s;t of &s;inners. But how does he alter his tone, when he comes to &s;peak of his candidates whom he would di&s;pen&s;e with. There he can &s;uppo&s;e, that the per&s;ons have <HI>a high value</HI> for the ordinance even <HI>too</HI> high; and that all the dif|ficulty lies in their doubts and fears whether they are duely qualified for &s;o &s;acred and &s;olemn an in&s;titution.

And yet, to our amazement, after all this group of expre&s;&s;ions; and after he had further declared, "that we find no warrant for any exception in the word of God, let the plea for it be what it will," he comes at length to grant, in direct contradiction to all he had &s;aid, that it is "<HI>often</HI> the ca&s;e that real good chri&s;tians may be under &s;uch &s;cruples, under &s;uch doubts and fears, as to deter them from the Lord's-&s;upper, and yet &s;ee their way clear to offer their children to bapti&s;m. <HI>p.</HI> 38.

I would ob&s;erve here, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> is quite as ready to fly to human authority as I, when he thinks it makes for him: the in&s;tances of it in his book are numerous; and even in his letter, does he not have recour&s;e to human authority? what a &s;tre&s;s does he there lay on the authority of the WOMEN? It &s;eems to be the chief argument in that epi&s;tle; "I que&s;tion, &s;ays he, whether you have 4 women in the whole church with you;" and this he "thinks matter of weighty con&s;ideration in the affair." (E&s;&s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 35.) I never-knew before but that the authority of <HI>men,</HI> was as <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> as that of <HI>women,</HI> e&s;pecially of women the mo&s;t part of whom had never heard or read any thing about the affair. But to leave trifting, I doubt not but that he thinks it &s;omewhat in the <HI>ante-poedobapti&s;t</HI> controver&s;y, that their opinion is novel, and was never heard of in the chri&s;tian church till about 200 years ago. So that even according to him, it is lawful to mention hu|man authority, or "the deci&s;ions of men" &s;ometimes,
<PB N="67" REF="012739_0064_0F8BEAD8B2DB7478">in way of illu&s;tration or collateral proof. As for the piece of hi&s;tory that follows, (for he mu&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf an hi&s;torian as well as divine) I am certain he is mi&s;taken: in the primitive church, they were admitted as <HI>catachumens,</HI> long before they were bap|tized; and they were for the mo&s;t part baptized (e&s;pecially if <HI>gentiles</HI> before) &s;ometime before they were confirmed; though in &s;everal in&s;tances, where the candidate appeared a great proficient, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> and others, bapti&s;m and confirmati|on immediately followed one the other.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 38, 9. he &s;ays, "That I certainly intimate in many places, that the <HI>&s;ame e&s;&s;ential</HI> qualifications were not nece&s;&s;ary for the one ordinance as the other." Where this certain intimation appears, I know not: all that they can ju&s;tly infer from my words is, that the church need not be &s;o &s;trict re&s;|pecting candidates for bapti&s;m as for the Lords-&s;up|per; but if there be the lowe&s;t degree of proba|bility, or but a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of their being gracious, though they have many fears about them, they ought not to be excluded, in ca&s;e they a&s;k this pri|vilege for their children. The one is a &s;acrament of entrance, the other of growth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The wor&s;t of &s;inners, if they appear penitent to the church, ought to be immediately baptized. But in &s;ome ca&s;es it would not be &s;o advi&s;able to re|ceive him directly to the Lord's-&s;upper. The mo&s;t ignorant of <HI>heathens</HI> may be taught enough in an hours time, and he may appear to receive it &s;o cor|dially, that he may be intitled to bapti&s;m; yet not have knowlege enough to be received immediately to the Lord's-&s;upper.</P>
<P>In the next page, he ob&s;erves that "the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in <HI>New-England</HI> allowed this privilege to none but the children of communicants." And in many other places he &s;ays, that "this practice is contrary to the <HI>original plan</HI> upon which the&s;e church|es were &s;ettled." <HI>p.</HI> 1. 53. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How he dur&s;t &s;o bold|ly affirm this I know not: I am &s;ure with re&s;pect to <HI>Plymouth</HI> church he a&s;&s;erts it intirely by gue&s;s; for there are no church records extant but what were written after my grandfather's &s;ettlement in
<PB N="68" REF="012739_0065_0F8BEAD9C1B5D9D8">1667. And no account of their practice in this particular in their early days; nor any account of their &s;entiments at all except what makes again&s;t Mr. <HI>R.</HI> The mini&s;ters and elders weekly cate|chi&s;ing and in&s;tructing, putting que&s;tions, and preaching or expounding the principles of religi|on to the children of the church, and training them up for the Lords-&s;upper; their dealing with them as members as much as the communicants; their admitting them to covenant more than once, in a body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all contrary to modern example, and incon&s;i&s;tent with pre&s;ent principles or practices. It is certain there is nothing in the church records, that directly militates with this practice, and we may with great propriety put the que&s;tion here, that has been &s;o often put at this day, <HI>"who was ever denied?"</HI> can he produce an in&s;tance of one baptized per&s;on that applied, and was refu&s;ed, either in a general or particular manner? nothing &s;urely can be inferred from a church's forbearing the practice, what their real principle was about it; it might be owing to none's applying, and not to principle. I might add, that there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI>'s (their fir&s;t mini&s;ter's) writings, that look favorably towards this practice.</P>
<P>And as to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> he cannot but know what were the &s;entiments of al|mo&s;t all the fir&s;t fathers in the point. I having lent him Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s book intitled, "<HI>the fir&s;t principles of New-England,</HI> &amp;c." whether he thought it worth reading or no, I cannot tell; but if he did read it, I am amazed he &s;hould talk as he does. The fact was this, the fir&s;t comers were generally communicants, &s;o there was no occa&s;ion to di&s;cu&s;s the point: but when grand-children were born, and the country increa&s;ed, after a due con&s;ideration of the point, mo&s;t of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers (being then alive) fell in with the practice. But I have &s;poke enough upon this head in the E&s;&s;ays, which it &s;eems he deems unworthy of the lea&s;t notice; except to &s;peak in direct contradiction to part of it.</P>
<P>As to "the melancholy pro&s;titution of this ordi|nance" by their po&s;terity, &s;o contrary to the origi|nal
<PB N="69" REF="012739_0066_0F8BEADA1DE3D718">de&s;ign of the <HI>&s;ynod,</HI> which he tells us of in the &s;ame page, whether he accu&s;es him&s;elf or others, I know not; I leave his own con&s;cience to judge: but I would tell him this, that I am far from plead|ing guilty to the charge, while I was in the mini&s;t|ry: and I do not doubt many other mini&s;ters can &s;ay the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I now come to his fifth Section, from <HI>p.</HI> 41. to <HI>p.</HI> 51.</P>
<P>Wherein he endeavors to &s;hew, that my book con|tains little el&s;e but a bundle of incon&s;i&s;tencies and contradictions, or el&s;e is very erroneous and weak, and betrays great confu&s;ion of thought. "It would be <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, to follow Mr. <HI>C.</HI> in all his contra|dictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies." Therefore it &s;eems he only &s;elects a few.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t entrance on this Section, <HI>p.</HI> 41. there &s;eems to be as many mi&s;repre&s;entations almo&s;t as lines: he intirely mi&s;takes "<HI>the grand point</HI> I am aiming at." "It is, &s;ays he, to prove that it is <HI>lawful</HI> for per&s;ons that have been baptized and are not &s;candalous, to own the covenant and have bapti&s;m for their children though they <HI>neglect</HI> to come up to the other ordinance; and that church|es ought to admit them to the former, though they refu&s;e the latter." This I have already di&s;claimed: I &s;ay with him, let all <HI>neglecters</HI> and <HI>refu&s;ers</HI> be ex|cluded, if he can prove them &s;uch.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of incon&s;i&s;tence that he alleges is, that I charge him "with propo&s;ing a popi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, and yet my whole book is wrote to e&s;|tabli&s;h the lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation." I de|ny the charge: I made a di&s;tinction between <HI>a mere &s;ufferance or pa&s;&s;ive connivance,</HI> and an <HI>actual allowance.</HI> The former I &s;aid was the ca&s;e according to the pre&s;ent mode, and the latter according to his &s;cheme. There mu&s;t be an <HI>actual vote</HI> in the ca&s;e, after the candidate had promi&s;ed to come immediately. He him&s;elf once &s;aw the force of this di&s;tinction, when I di&s;cour&s;ed with him in private, and endeavored to contrive methods to obviate the difficulty. But now the &s;cale is turned, and he endeavors to involve me in the &s;ame difficulty. I know no way to ac|count for it, but by &s;uppo&s;ing his <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tant</HI> wrote this
<PB N="70" REF="012739_0067_0F8BEADAE8273C60">part, who did not &s;o much con&s;ider. But &s;uppo&s;|ing the di&s;pen&s;ation on both &s;ides were of the like tenor, all that can be &s;aid upon it is, that this ar|gument of mine mu&s;t &s;tand for nothing, but does not in the lea&s;t invalidate my other pleas again&s;t his expedient.</P>
<P>The &s;econd in&s;tance of incon&s;i&s;tence is, that I call "baptized per&s;ons <HI>real</HI> members, <HI>compleat</HI> members, vi&s;ible chr&s;tians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet in effect call t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em el&s;ewhere a <HI>carnal generation,</HI> &amp;c." I would a&s;k him, whether the prophets, <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t, yea, Chri&s;t him&s;elf, have not frequently done the like? and does not he and other mini&s;ters often do the &s;ame in their preaching? we may certainly expre&s;s our fears in a general way, that there is too great reigning car|nality among profe&s;&s;ors, whether communicants or others; and yet not do right in rejecting indivi|duals when they offer them&s;elves again&s;t whom we know no ju&s;t objection. And it is certain, if bap|tized per&s;ons &s;hould generally come to communion, we &s;hould have a greater number of carnal com|municants than we have now. As for that expre&s;|&s;ion, "that the church would willingly admit the&s;e candidates in full; but the difficulty lies in their own brea&s;ts, not in ours." <HI>I</HI> &s;peak not here of baptized per&s;ons in general (as he intimates) but only of tho&s;e who actually apply, again&s;t whom is no ju&s;t exception.</P>
<P>The next incon&s;i&s;tency (<HI>p.</HI> 42.) is already obvi|ated under the ob&s;ervations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And here <HI>I</HI> can|not but ob&s;erve what a captious di&s;po&s;ition it &s;hews, to repeat over and over detached &s;hreds and pa&s;|&s;ages, which appear quite harmle&s;s and natural, as they &s;tand in connection.</P>
<P>He here &s;eems to have done with incon&s;i&s;tencies for the pre&s;ent, and next mu&s;ters up a number of particulars, to make me appear ignorant and weak, or very erroneous.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 43. He taxes me with gro&s;s error in a&s;&s;ert|ing, "that children's member&s;hip is a <HI>di&s;tinct thing</HI> from that of their parents, though coming through their means; and that to puni&s;h them, becau&s;e their parents do not immediately approach to the
<PB N="71" REF="012739_0068_0F8BEADB8E468A80">Lord's-table, is hard and injurious." But where does the error lye? is it in the fir&s;t part? dare he deny, that their member&s;hip is di&s;tinct? are they not di&s;tinct parties in the covenant! <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. Does not their member&s;hip remain, when their parents are dead, and their relation to the vi&s;ible church wholly cea&s;ed?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> remarks, that &s;ome of the oppo&s;ers of the <HI>&s;ynod</HI> were &s;o ab&s;urd, as to make a &s;erious que&s;tion of it, <HI>whether men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o not remain members of the vi&s;i|ble church after they are dead?</HI> <Q>But can any man (&s;ays the doctor) in good earne&s;t think, that an hypocrite when he is dead and gone to his own place, is &s;till a member of God's church? yet his infant child is &s;o: therefore the member&s;hip of the child doth exi&s;t after the member&s;hip of the parent is extinct; therefore it is really di&s;tinct from the parents member&s;hip.</Q> <HI>Subjects of bapt.</HI> p. <HI>64.</HI></NOTE> And do not the children of of|fenders, though ever &s;o young, retain their mem|ber&s;hip, after their parents are excommunicated? which could not be, if their member&s;hip was not di&s;tinct. But it is perhaps the inference that of|fends him, "to puni&s;h children, becau&s;e their parents do not immediately come to the Lord's-ta|ble, is hard and injurtous." I think &s;o &s;till: for if they are in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ation, as to be <HI>real members</HI> of the church as being children of members (which way of arguing he has not yet di&s;proved) they ought to have the &s;eal. But will it not follow from hence, "that the children of all baptized per&s;ons however &s;cand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lous, ought to have the &s;eal?" I an&s;wer, no; if parents have actually <HI>forfeited</HI> their member&s;hip, their children cannot properly be called the children of members. Or if they have not forfeited it, the church ought not to force the privilege upon them, without a&s;king. But if they come and a&s;k for it, and no proper objection made again&s;t their conduct, who dare deny them?</P>
<P>He next accu&s;es me of great confu&s;ion of thought in that expre&s;&s;ion, "bapti&s;m &s;eals &s;aving ble&s;&s;ing to the unregenerate, <HI>conditionally.</HI>" It is an expre&s;|&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Stoddard's,</HI> and let him fight it out
<PB N="72" REF="012739_0069_0F8BEADCF19E87A8">with him. However, I mu&s;t tell him, that I &s;ee no impropriety in the expre&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e there &s;hould be a covenant wrote between him and me, and I &s;hould &s;ign and &s;eal it, but he by rea&s;on of ab&s;ence or otherwi&s;e &s;hould not &s;ign and &s;eal for weeks and months, it may properly be called a &s;ealed covenant on my part, but yet <HI>conditionally;</HI> it takes no effect till he hath &s;ealed it likewi&s;e. The &s;ame may be &s;aid in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But what advantage would it be to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a condition|al &s;eal on God's part? what benefit does it con|vey any more to the baptized than unbaptized? I an&s;wer, great benefit, even according to him. For he &s;ays a few pages after, "there are promi&s;es all over the bible to the children of believers." And is it no advantage to have &s;uch promi&s;es &s;ealed to them, though at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of unregene|racy? I make no doubt but <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> whom I there mentioned by name, found great benefit by this conditional &s;eal. For from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the old-te&s;tament, we may infer that he died a good man, however bad in his younger years.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of "the &s;ame confu&s;ion, &s;ays he, appears in my idea or de&s;cription of a &s;eal." <HI>p.</HI> 43. I had &s;aid and I think fully proved, that prayer, hearing, reading, offering &s;acrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were &s;eals, always &s;eals of the covenant of grace, when proper|ly u&s;ed. And I would now further tell him, that the &s;aying of the Lord's prayer (which is the pat|tern of all true prayer) <HI>from the heart,</HI> is as much a &s;olemn covenant tran&s;action as if any per&s;on &s;hould &s;tand in the broad alley, and &s;hould have the cove|nant in form propounded to him. True prayer is a covenant tran&s;action always; there is a promi&s;e on God's part, and there is a &s;eal on our part in pleading and laying hold of it. In an&s;wer to this, he &s;eems readily to grant, that prayer, hearing, reading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;eals, if u&s;ed in faith. And &s;urely bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper are &s;eals in no other &s;en&s;e. A <HI>conditional &s;eal</HI> he hath been ju&s;t laughing at. So that all the ordinances in this re&s;pect &s;eem to be upon a par. Hence I argued, that if unre|generate men may lawfully u&s;e &s;ome of the &s;eals
<PB N="73" REF="012739_0070_0F8BEADD1EADF548">(con&s;idered only as &s;eals) he may upon the &s;ame ground u&s;e the other, yea all, and that there was nothing in the <HI>nature</HI> of a &s;eal to hinder him. Con|&s;equently, their argument taken merely from the word &s;eal (which they laid &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon) was of no force. However, that there were &s;ome other con&s;iderations which rendered it not proper, that bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper &s;hould be made as <HI>common</HI> as the other ordinances, though this from the nature of a &s;eal was given up. Of this latter clau&s;e he takes no notice; and as to the other part of the argument, he &s;eems not to have the lea&s;t idea of what I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imed at; which was not to prove (as he a&s;&s;erts) that all &s;orts, good and bad, even the mo&s;t &s;candalous, have a right to bapti&s;m; but that the re&s;trictive u&s;e of this and the other ordinance could not be argued merely from the term <HI>&s;eal</HI> (which was a common name for all the ordinances) but mu&s;t be taken from other topicks. As much as to &s;ay, that a barrier ought indeed to be &s;et round the ordinances of bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper; but that this could not be proved barely from the word <HI>&s;eal</HI> (this being a common term) but mu&s;t be taken from weightier con&s;idera|tions, namely, the expre&s;s declarations of God in &s;cripture. This gives me occa&s;ion to caution him not to mi&s;take me again, as he has done above twenty-times in my book, I hope not wilfully.</P>
<P>Next, he animadverts upon "my &s;trange notions about a&s;&s;urance," and wre&s;ts my words in a &s;trange manner. It appears to me the unavoidable con&s;e|quence of their doctrine, that <HI>full a&s;&s;urance</HI> is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to coming to the ordinance: &s;o far as they doubt of their &s;tate, &s;o far they mu&s;t doubt of their right; and no man ought to come to it with a <HI>doubting con&s;cience,</HI> e&s;pecially if the &s;in be greater for an unregenerate per&s;on to come than to &s;tay away, (as &s;ome of them expre&s;sly teach.) Now if full a&s;&s;urance or an a&s;&s;urance that excludes all doubt be nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be attained before they come; and if attained, what need they come to attain what they have already? as it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="74" REF="012739_0071_0F8BEADDB81986C8">for a man regenerate to come to the means to obtain regenerating grace, which he is already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. But yet in both ca&s;es, they ought to come for other ends: the a&s;&s;ured chri&s;tian ought to come to get his a&s;&s;urance confirmed, habituated and pre&s;erved, which may be lo&s;t many ways; he ought to come to have his <HI>graces</HI> increa&s;ed and &s;trengthened, for certainly they are not come to their full &s;trength, although his <HI>evidences</HI> are; there being no <HI>higher pitch</HI> than full a&s;&s;urance attainable in this life: he ought to come to te&s;tify his love and re&s;pect to his gracious Lord and ma&s;ter, and for many other valuable ends. The&s;e I thought needle&s;s to &s;et down, becau&s;e not to the point in hand. How injurious then is Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s repre&s;enta|tion of the matter, as if I held that the ordinances were in&s;tituted only or principally "to a&s;certain to a man his own &s;afe &s;tate:" But it is his way to take all opportunities to repre&s;ent me weak or wicked.</P>
<P>As to his a&s;&s;ertion, that my &s;cheme nece&s;&s;arily involves me in the &s;ame difficulty they are under, or "that the dead weight I mention lies full as heavy upon me as on them," I &s;ee no ju&s;t grounds for it. I have already noticed a two-fold di&s;tincti|on relative to our right in the &s;ight of God, which I think &s;ufficiently clears me. And then further, Dr. <HI>B.</HI> holds. that it is a <HI>greater &s;in</HI> for an unregene|rate man (however &s;incere or whatever his hopes are) to come than to &s;tay away, (which doctrine he no where di&s;avows, though I rendred it nece&s;|&s;ary for him to do it, if he was of another mind) which certainly is a &s;ufficient bar again&s;t any one's coming upon uncertainties. Whereas if they incur le&s;s guilt by coming than by ab&s;enting, though uncertain and even under a mi&s;take, they had better come than not, in hopes divine mercy will ble&s;s the ordinance for their &s;piritual good. This leads me to take notice of his &s;urprizing argu|mentation (taken from Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> although he gives him not credit for it.) <HI>p.</HI> 46. <Q>If the Lord's-&s;upper were only a privilege, which I am allow|ed to take, upon certain qualifications in me;
<PB N="75" REF="012739_0072_0F8BEAE502C11018">and forbidden, if I had not tho&s;e qualifications; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it would certainly be &s;afe&s;t for me to ab&s;tain, till I <HI>know</HI> I have the qualifications. But &s;uppo&s;ing I am &s;trictly commanded and en|joined by God, to take, if I have tho&s;e qualifica|tions then it is EQUALLY dangerous to neglect on uncertainties as to take on uncertainties.</Q> What, <HI>equally</HI> dangerous, when the &s;in is <HI>greater</HI> on the &s;ide of coming! what, &s;hall I be guilty of a greater &s;in in coming than "drunkenne&s;s, adultery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" and yet had I be&s;t come after all, though I do not know but that I may involve my&s;elf in &s;uch heinous guilt? &s;urely &s;uch &s;ort of rea&s;oning will convince no body but &s;uch as believe with their <HI>wills,</HI> and not with their <HI>under&s;tandings.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing the guilt <HI>equal</HI> on both &s;ides, as the words in this place import, then it &s;eems the &s;cale is even: a man in doubt mu&s;t neither come nor &s;tay away: there is nothing to preponderate on the one &s;ide or the other; he may chu&s;e either, and not be more guilty. And yet notwith&s;tanding this even bal|lance, the inference is, that he ought to come. "An inference truly worthy a <HI>logician.</HI>" It would not avail them here to &s;ay, that a man hath <HI>pre|vailing hopes</HI> in the ca&s;e: for what good will the&s;e prevailing hopes do him, if he be <HI>really mi&s;taken</HI> af|ter all? &s;uch hopes do not abate, but rather ag|gravate his guilt. So that the&s;e ought not to turn the &s;cale in favor of coming. Nothing but ab&s;olute certainty will do. This is &s;o plain a ca&s;e, that when one of his intimates in the mini&s;try (of one &s;oul with him in this di&s;pute) was lately pre&s;&s;ed with my <HI>dead weight,</HI> and when beat out of their common place &s;ubter-fuges (&s;uch as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> u&s;es) he at la&s;t openly declared, "that he did not care if this con&s;equence did follow from their doctrine, it was true doctrine, and none ought to come with|out they had <HI>a&s;&s;urance.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the next paragraph. 46. I &s;carce know what he is after. I had &s;aid, "if a man declares on oath more than he knows, he is guilty of perjury, though it happen afterwards to appear true, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" Does he deny this? no, not in direct terms. But
<PB N="76" REF="012739_0073_0F8BEAE74EDCF268">he endeavors to make it a contradiction to another pa&s;&s;age of mine, namely, "that if a per&s;on offers his child in bapti&s;m he mu&s;t &s;ay, that as far as he knows his own heart he is &s;incerely willing to give up him&s;elf and his children to God." Does this man declare more than he knows? are the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ion <HI>as far as he knows,</HI> and, <HI>more than he knows,</HI> &s;ynony|mous? what trifling is here?</P>
<P>Further, he &s;ays, "that if there be any validity in my way of rea&s;oning here, all the forms of cove|nanting u&s;ed all over the country mu&s;t be aboli&s;h|ed." I an&s;wer, it is high time they were aboli&s;h|ed, if they oblige men to &s;ay upon oath more than they know; or to declare that to be true which they do not know to be true; or in other words, to tell their maker and the church in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that they <HI>have &s;aving faith,</HI> when they do not know whether they have it or not. I never put any &s;uch con&s;truction upon the cove|nant, nor I believe any one el&s;e before this day.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 47. he taxes me with "a very great mi&s;|take (not to call it wor&s;e) in a&s;&s;erting, that he de|nied infant member&s;hip." And to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e he &s;peaks more largely in his marginal note, <HI>p.</HI> 30.31. I never a&s;&s;erted, that he held baptized infants &s;tood in no &s;ort of relation to the church: but that he denied their member&s;hip in any <HI>proper &s;en&s;e,</HI> if I can under&s;tand language, he did do it, and that in the plaine&s;t manner: and this not by a tran&s;ient expre&s;&s;ion; it was a point talked of near half an hour; and this was all we could bring him to own, after all po&s;&s;ible canva&s;&s;ings and endea|vors to make him &s;peak out, <HI>that they were laid under bonds,</HI> &amp;c. Upon which one of the members &s;aid, "that if this was all that was imported in infant member&s;hip, <HI>i. e.</HI> that they were only laid under bonds, but intitled to no privilege, then they were <HI>mere bond &s;laves;</HI>" which occa&s;ioned a &s;harp reproof. And pre&s;ently after, upon my mentioning that pa&s;|&s;age of the catechi&s;m, <HI>the infants of &s;uch as are mem|bers of the vi&s;ible church are to be baptized,</HI> he readily granted it. Which implied that the per&s;ons in que&s;tion were not members. How could we un|der&s;tand
<PB N="77" REF="012739_0074_0F8BEAE7810F5CC0">him otherwi&s;e than that he denied their member&s;hip in any proper &s;en&s;e? But the truth of the matter is, he hath &s;hifted &s;o often, when pre&s;&s;|ed clo&s;ely, and &s;ometimes owned and &s;ometimes denied, as &s;uited the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that we &s;carce know how to take him. However, if we may judge by his book, comparing one pa&s;&s;age with another, his <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> opinion &s;eems to be this; when they are fir&s;t baptized they are <HI>proper members,</HI> but when they grow up, their member&s;hip wears off by piece-meal or they gradually lo&s;e it, till at la&s;t it is quite gone, unle&s;s they come to the Lord's-table; and this without the churches &s;etting a mark on them, or any chargeable irregularity. But if they go &s;o far as actually to own the cove|nant, <HI>half</HI> of their (proper) member&s;hip remains, the other half is lo&s;t. How rea&s;onable this is ap|pears el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Next he ob&s;erves, "that this half-way practice tends to bring infant bapti&s;m into di&s;grace, and that <HI>nothing in the world</HI> hath contributed more to prejudice many again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, and to in|crea&s;e the number of <HI>anabapti&s;ts</HI> among us than this." <HI>p.</HI> 48. For this we have only his <HI>ip&s;e dixit.</HI> I never heard or read of any, that made this their main plea; yea, I never heard it pleaded at all by the favorers of <HI>anabapti&s;m</HI> (though I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal.) And plain fact proves, that this a&s;|&s;ertion is not true. For let us look all around us, and we &s;hall find, that the places where the <HI>ana|bapti&s;ts</HI> have mo&s;t generally increa&s;ed, are &s;uch places where this practice is &s;hut out. And indeed the very &s;hutting it out, affords them a good plea, (which they do not fall to u&s;e:) "for here, &s;ay they, are &s;ome whom you have received as mem|bers, and acknowlege as members; and yet actually treat them as no members; you will not baptize their children, nor exerci&s;e any di&s;cipline over them, but let them run as lambs in a large pa&s;ture: what is their member&s;hip good for, if they are allow|ed no privilege, nor any care taken of them? it were much better they had never been baptized at all." This plea&s;urely carries great weight with it. The
<PB N="78" REF="012739_0075_0F8BEAE888FA9580">only way to di&s;prove it, would be to treat them as members, and to revive a godly di&s;cipline over them (as &s;trict as that over communicants, which was practi&s;ed in the days of our fathers) and then their prejudices would gradually vani&s;h.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ju&s;t take notice of his marginal note here (<HI>p.</HI> 48.) becau&s;e he hath accu&s;ed me of <HI>&s;ewing pillows,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>dawbing,</HI> &amp;c. and would a&s;k, whether there is no appearance of it here? <Q>I would not be under|&s;tood, &s;ays he, by any thing I have &s;aid to im|peach the characters of any in <HI>this place,</HI> who have owned the covenant. It mu&s;t be acknow|leged they are, to all appearance, per&s;ons of good characters and <HI>exemplary conver&s;ation.</HI></Q> If this be true, it is &s;urely a good encouragement to proceed in the practice. But can he &s;ay upon his con&s;cience, that he never heard any thing <HI>ami&s;s</HI> of <HI>one</HI> of them? and yet is he care&s;&s;ed. as one of the deare&s;t and mo&s;t bo&s;om friends and companions?</P>
<P>I now come to the grand point, the <HI>proton-p&s;eu|dos</HI> of all. <HI>p.</HI> 49. <Q>Mr. <HI>C.</HI> &s;ays he, in defending this practice (as many others have done before him) has naturally, and I think, upon his plan nece&s;&s;arily, warped off from <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> and run into &s;entiments re&s;pecting men's <HI>natural depravity,</HI> exactly agreable to <HI>arminian</HI> writers.</Q> When I fir&s;t read the charge of <HI>arminiani&s;m</HI> in his letter, I was a&s;toni&s;hed, and could not imagine from whence it took it's ri&s;e: but &s;ince I have had opportunity of reading &s;everal <HI>connecticut</HI> writers on the &s;ubject, which unfolded the my&s;tery. The charge it &s;eems was brought by Dr <HI>B.</HI> again&s;t his antagoni&s;ts on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion with me in that co|lony, and that perhaps not without &s;ome founda|tion: Mr. <HI>R.</HI> took it from him as it were <HI>by rote,</HI> and thought the charge was calculated for the <HI>meridian</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> as well as <HI>Connecticut,</HI> without <HI>being able</HI> to comprehend the different plans we went upon; and therefore in a random confu&s;ed manner he hath exhibited it again&s;t me; and through me again&s;t all that ever were in the prac|tice. And having once brought the charge, he thinks him&s;elf obliged in honor to defend it,
<PB N="79" REF="012739_0076_0F8BEAE9132E2800">though it would have been much more to his honor to have retracted it, and not have need|le&s;sly expo&s;ed him&s;elf. But how does he defend it? Why, by alleging &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in my E&s;&s;ays, which he &s;ays are of <HI>arminian</HI> &s;ound. Here I would de&s;ire the reader to turn to his letter, and they will find that this charge is not founded on &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as he here produces, but on "the practice it&s;elf and the arguments made u&s;e of" (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 35.) whereas the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are no nece&s;&s;ary part of the argument, but are mere <HI>tran&s;ient expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> and might as well have been left out, and my arguments would have remained in full force. But this is a fetch that he hath thought of, or was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by &s;ome friend when he came to &s;tudy and an&s;wer my piece after printing. If he had thought of the&s;e in the time of writing his letter, in&s;tead of found|ing the charge upon the general &s;cheme and run of the arguments (which he is careful not to call <HI>my arguments,</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould give me too much credit) he would have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus that in &s;uch and &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions I <HI>arminianized,</HI> and not that the general &s;cheme was incumbered with this difficulty.</P>
<P>But let us now look into tho&s;e dangerous pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;ee what he can make of them. Fir&s;t, &s;ays he, "he frequently repre&s;ents natural men as <HI>truly de|&s;irous of</HI> avouching the Lord for their God." I flatly deny the charge; there is not the lea&s;t found|ation for it in my E&s;&s;ays. Next, &s;ays he, "he fre|quently repre&s;ents natural men as <HI>&s;incerely</HI> entring into covenant with God, and giving up them&s;elves and their children to him in covenant." This is as groundle&s;s as the other. Is there no difference between a man's <HI>prevailingly hoping</HI> he does a duty &s;incerely (<HI>i. e.</HI> graciou&s;ly) and his <HI>really</HI> doing it in that manner? tho&s;e that have been <HI>long under conviction</HI> mu&s;t certainly know, that they pa&s;s through &s;uch a variety of di&s;po&s;itions, as that they are exceeding apt to take it for &s;aving grace: &s;ometimes mourn|ing and great relentings for &s;in, it appearing to them the mo&s;t odious thing in the world: &s;ome|times great pangs of affection; &s;ometimes great
<PB N="80" REF="012739_0077_0F8BEAE9C3444DC0">joy at &s;ome imperfect di&s;coveries of go&s;pel grace, or upon viewing go&s;pel encouragements; &s;ome|times all the&s;e &s;treams are dried up, and they ap|pear to them&s;elves the mo&s;t hardened wretches in the world; and then they flow again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus it may be alternately for years. And during the continuance of &s;uch operations, they may be (at times) as fully &s;atisfied of their <HI>&s;incerity</HI> as that they have a being (whether it be a <HI>gracious &s;incerity</HI> they know not). And in &s;uch a ca&s;e, may they not ju&s;tly &s;ay (&s;ay it without lying) "that as far as they know their own heart they are &s;incerely willing to give them&s;elves and their children to God? Mr. <HI>R. art thou a</HI> MASTER IN ISRAEL, <HI>and know|e&s;t not the&s;e things?</HI> if not, it is high time you &s;hould: and for that end, to read <HI>Mead, Allen, Guthry,</HI> and &s;uch experimental writers; if it be not beneath you to read &s;uch low authors as the&s;e.

Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s mi&s;take, whenever he is &s;peaking of the unregenerate, &s;eems to ari&s;e from his con&s;idering them in their <HI>mere naturals</HI> (in which nothing but hell is breathed forth) wholly de&s;titute of the <HI>common</HI> influences of the &s;pirit, or of tho&s;e divine <HI>afflatus</HI>'s which the unrege|nerate are capable of; &s;uch as <HI>Balaam</HI> was under when he talks &s;o divinely, or <HI>Saul</HI> when he had <HI>another heart</HI> (though not a <HI>new heart</HI>) given him; or the divine impre&s;&s;ions the <HI>&s;tony ground hearers</HI> were under, though the <HI>&s;tony heart</HI> &s;till remained. In which ca&s;e, not only <HI>outward acts</HI> of &s;in are re&s;train|ed; but the <HI>inward motions</HI> of &s;in are pent up; &s;o that their inclination to them &s;eems to be gone, and their hearts ri&s;e within them with indigna|tion again&s;t them&s;elves, whenever they think of their old ways. This is a common ca&s;e. And whenever it is &s;o, it is natural for men (who are unacquainted with the real operations of divine or &s;anctifying grace) to think them&s;elves <HI>&s;incere,</HI>

<P>But what are the&s;e quotations!

<P>I now proceed to his &s;ixth &s;ection from <HI>p.</HI> 51. to <HI>p.</HI> 60.</P>
<P>Wherein he endeavors to &s;how, that I have <HI>mi&s;|apprehended</HI> him in &s;ome things, and <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> him in others. Some of the in&s;tances, he alleges I have either already, or &s;hall hereafter con&s;ider; and therefore &s;hall pa&s;s them here.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance is, "that I repre&s;ent it as his opinion. that a man mu&s;t know he is in a gracious &s;tate, mu&s;t have <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> before he come, <HI>&amp;c." p.</HI> 51. "This is unfair, &s;ays he, we never held any &s;uch doctrine." To this I &s;uppo&s;e he refers in that pa&s;|&s;age of his letter. "You, &s;ir, do certainly know, that neither I nor the brethren hold &s;uch things as you there advanced as being our &s;entiments." (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 34.) Whether he holds it or no, I am certain it is the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> con&s;equence of his princi|ples, as I have often noted. But where can we find that I directly charge him with this? he refers for proof to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the E&s;&s;ays, the fir&s;t is <HI>p.</HI> 6.

(which is one of the pages he refers to): and is not the <HI>latter</HI> there charg|ed only as the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence</HI> of his doctrine?
<PB N="88" REF="012739_0085_0F8BEAF1353012D8">I am &s;ure Dr. <HI>B.</HI> makes u&s;e of the word <HI>knowlege</HI> or <HI>knowing</HI> in the ca&s;e.

His u&s;ual phra&s;e I know is, that <HI>prevailing hopes</HI> are &s;ufficient. But is not even this carrying the matter too far? there is no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> difference be|tween the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> coming to ordinances, and the <HI>after</HI>-coming (they renewing covenant as really each time); and if the fir&s;t coming mu&s;t be with pre|vailing hopes, then the after coming mu&s;t be &s;o too: con&s;equently per&s;ons mu&s;t never come when they are under <HI>prevailing fears.</HI> And is this right? mu&s;t this door of con&s;olation be &s;hut? mu&s;t chri&s;tians be excluded from ordinances when they &s;tand in mo&s;t need of them.</P>
<P>He next taxes me with treating him hardly and unju&s;tly in that pa&s;&s;age of the E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 26. "It hath been once and again &s;aid, that the purport of the new &s;cheme is to <HI>enlarge,</HI> and not to <HI>curtail and di|mini&s;h their privileges.</HI> viz. by obliging them to come immediately into full communion." And is not this an obligation with a witne&s;s? and de&s;igned as &s;uch? for how could their privileges be <HI>enlarged</HI> in any other way but by coming? if they &s;tayed away, he would allow them no privilege at all.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page, he taxes me with mi&s;take (if not fal&s;hood) in the account I gave of Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s introducing the practice. But which is mo&s;t like|ly to know the truth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acts, whether Mr. <HI>R</HI> or I who lived upon the &s;pot in the time of it, I leave the world to judge.

But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>R.</HI> will not believe any thing that comes from our quarter, if it does not &s;uit him. This is not the only in&s;tance of his <HI>infidelity.</HI> It is certain matter of fact, that Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> had the majority with him long before the point was brought to a public deci&s;ion. That the practice was received by a <HI>unanimous voice</HI> I never a&s;&s;erted; but that there was a <HI>general acquie&s;cence</HI> I have the
<PB N="89" REF="012739_0086_0F8BEAF760B27FA8">utmo&s;t rea&s;on to believe. As to &s;ome (<HI>i. e.</HI> two or three's) objecting, mentioned in the record, that was previous to the vote, and is no ways incon&s;i&s;t|ent with their declaring they would acquie&s;ce, if the generality of the church were for introducing the practice; and "the <HI>calmne&s;s</HI>" with which the meeting was carried on and concluded, &s;hows it to be the ca&s;e. And if it had been otherwi&s;e, is it not &s;trange that &s;ome or other &s;hould not remem|ber it, be&s;ides the "aged member," mentioned by Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (it being tran&s;acted but about 41 years ago) As to the account given by &s;aid aged per&s;on (if I am informed right) it &s;o <HI>directly militated</HI> with the record, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (though he made u&s;e of it in his private vi&s;its, to prove the deacon and me, <HI>liars,</HI> yet he) was afraid to &s;et it down in full in his book. But if the record had not providentially &s;tood in his way, how unmercifully would he have triumphed over us, upon this &s;ingle te&s;timony? and indeed he can &s;carce help doing it notwith&s;tanding. I do not intend here|by, to ca&s;t any di&s;paragement upon this aged mem|ber (I reckon him a <HI>worthy one</HI> as well as Mr. <HI>R.</HI>); but age and infirmity may make him forget.</P>
<P>As for the charge of <HI>"innovation"</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 53.) I never brought it again&s;t him. He hath a right to pro|po&s;e an alteration, if he be con&s;cienciou&s;ly per|&s;uaded. But I &s;hould have been glad, if he had been as prudent in the management of it as Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> was. If Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> in&s;tead of taking the &s;teps he did, had wrote two &s;uch letters either to elder <HI>Faunce,</HI> or old deacon <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> has done to me; in&s;tead of bringing in the practice, he would have outed him&s;elf (without a very hum|ble acknowlegement indeed), and brought &s;uch a &s;tain upon him as he could never have got over. And as to the "alteration's not <HI>originating</HI> from him," but that numbers of the brethren were di&s;|&s;atisfied with the practice previous to his appear|ing again&s;t it, I have rea&s;on to think he is mi&s;taken. It was not &s;o much the practice <HI>it&s;elf</HI> as the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of it, that gave ground of di&s;&s;atisfaction. If only per|&s;ons of &s;erious characters had applied, I believe
<PB N="90" REF="012739_0087_0F8BEAF9A78CDCD8">none would have been unea&s;y; but that &s;ome (who&s;e real characters were better known to them than to the mini&s;ter) &s;hould &s;tand up in the con|gregation and covenant in &s;uch a &s;olemn manner, this filled them with trembling: and it would have been ju&s;t the &s;ame, if they had applied for full communion. This was really the ca&s;e, as I have heard &s;ome of the brethren declare, whom I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>R.</HI> refers to.</P>
<P>It makes me &s;ick to hear &s;o much of "the origi|nal plan of this church and of all the churches in <HI>New-England.</HI>" (<HI>p.</HI> 53.) They had really no plan about it; it was a point not thought of, till the <HI>third</HI> generation came upon the &s;tage. And then as &s;oon as there was occa&s;ion for it, the matter was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed; and not long after the practice was almo&s;t ganerally received.</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 55. He "takes notice of a <HI>very cruel</HI> in&s;tance of mi&s;repre&s;entation," as he calls it, namely, my &s;etting down that expre&s;&s;ion of his, <HI>what &s;ignifies it to have an infant &s;prinkled with a little water?</HI> this expre&s;|&s;ion, he &s;ays, or &s;omething like it was brought in in the mid&s;t of an <HI>elaborate &s;peech,</HI> which he &s;ets down. <HI>p.</HI> 56. But how was it po&s;&s;ible for him to make &s;uch a &s;peech, while I was actually reading my E&s;&s;ay? Could we both &s;peak at once? in fact, this expre&s;&s;ion &s;tood &s;ingly and alone, and was blurted out in the audience of &s;ome that &s;tood near him in the time of my reading, and not &s;poken in the hearing of the whole a&s;&s;embly, when I had done, in a &s;et an&s;wer to me. And indeed he never attempted a <HI>direct an&s;wer</HI> to any of my arguments in one of the church meetings, as I or others can re|collect. The truth is, that when he uttered this &s;entence, he was "under &s;uch great perturbation of &s;pirit" (of which hereafter) that I believe he &s;carce knew what he &s;aid; and if he had alleged this in excu&s;e, it would have &s;erved much better, than to have entertained his reader with a <HI>romantick &s;peech</HI> that no body ever heard before. It is certain, there is nothing contained in my <HI>thrid E&s;&s;ay,</HI> that gave proper foundation for &s;uch a &s;peech.

<PB N="91" REF="012739_0088_0F8BEAFAB7690730">of infant's bapti&s;m; and had carried the matter too far; even &s;o far, that people would be in danger of thinking that they were <HI>actually regenerated</HI> by bapti&s;m; and therefore all that were not baptized mu&s;t con&s;equently be lo&s;t.</Q> Where can he find one pa&s;&s;age in that third E&s;&s;ay tending that way? (or indeed in any of the E&s;&s;ays?) And I did not otherwi&s;e utter one word about the point in controver&s;y during that whole meeting; but &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided it, being then very unwell. (This then is all a mere <HI>fiction</HI> of his own) Again, he &s;ays, "Mr. <HI>C.</HI> then in&s;i&s;ted, that all baptized per&s;ons had a right to this privilege, whether re|generate or not, if they were free from <HI>here&s;y</HI> or <HI>&s;candal,</HI> &amp;c." But where can he find any thing of this in that third E&s;&s;ay? is there one word in it a+bout here&s;y or &s;candal? or about the right of un|regenerate per&s;ons? his <HI>foundation</HI> and <HI>&s;peech</HI> then mu&s;t both fall together, and pa&s;s with the reader for a mere non-entity. I am &s;orry I am obliged to &s;ay this; but mu&s;t I not &s;peak the truth? does he not enforce me to it in my own defence? and will he venture to call it <HI>cruelty</HI> again?</P>
<P>In <HI>p.</HI> 58. he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts contrary to &s;everal former conce&s;&s;ions, that <HI>all</HI> the baptized, who do not come to the Lord's-table, are <HI>wicked per&s;ons.</HI> He had before mu&s;tered up all the hard terms (or names) he could think of, calling them, <HI>neglecters, ha|bitual neglecters and violaters, renouncers, refu&s;ers,</HI> &amp;c.&amp;c. (The&s;e phra&s;es occur above 50 times in his book.) But here is the crowning cut, it comes at la&s;t to be <HI>"open wickedne&s;s."</HI> This they "live" in, and this they are likely to dye in, for it &s;eems as "the neglect is continued," and like to be &s;o to the end. And be|ing &s;o bad, they have it &s;eems "ju&s;tly forfeited the <HI>character</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of di&s;ciples, or vi&s;ible chri&s;ti|ans." What man or what woman of <HI>feeling</HI> will bear all this? and how is the <HI>brui&s;ed reed</HI> broken to purpo&s;e? did he think of this, when he preached his funeral &s;ermon? or did it come in mind, when he pa&s;&s;es &s;uch a <HI>compliment</HI> upon "the <HI>continued</HI> and <HI>habitual neglecters</HI>" (as he calls them) among us? <HI>p.</HI> 48.</P>

<P>He fir&s;t attacks me about <HI>publi&s;hing his letters,</HI> that pa&s;&s;ed between us; he begins with it in his pre|face, pur&s;ues it in his book, and repeats it over and over. He calls them <HI>"private letters:"</HI> but how could they be private, when all the town and country (where the public controver&s;y was known) had heard of the letters long before their printing? he tells us "that the publication of them was kept a profound &s;ecret from the &s;ub&s;cribers." The un|dertakers tell me the direct contrary; they never made a &s;ecret of it: but openly declared, that not <HI>"what was read,"</HI> but the <HI>whole affair</HI> &s;hould be brought into public. "Some, he &s;ays, would ne|ver have &s;ub&s;cribed, had they known of the print|ing of the letters." I never heard of but one that declared &s;o; and he, after the book came out, and had the opportunity of peru&s;al, &s;aid, he now &s;aw the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of printing the letters. But, "what have the public to do with private letters? what concern with matters merely per&s;onal? or that relate to &s;ome difference between two per&s;ons at <HI>Plymouth?</HI>" But how could they be called <HI>merely per&s;onal,</HI> unle&s;s they were written <HI>merely to vent his &s;pleen again&s;t me?</HI> Did they not relate to the que&s;ti|on in debate? was it not the <HI>only</HI> an&s;wer he had ever given <HI>directly</HI> to my E&s;&s;ays? and was it not natural to expect to find &s;omething in them edifying and in&s;tructing, tending to illu&s;trate the controver&s;y, and to bring conviction both to me and others? what a reflection does he ca&s;t upon him&s;elf, by &s;up|po&s;ing it to be otherwi&s;e? by calling them <HI>merely per&s;onal?</HI> by intimating that they contained matter foreign to the point? and that they were really nothing to the purpo&s;e? why did he write them then? "But I did not a&s;k his leave to publi&s;h them." What rea&s;on had he to expect this, after he had abu&s;ed me as he had done? But "I publi&s;hed them without his knowlege, he did not &s;o much as <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> it, till after they were gone to the pre&s;s." How could this be, when he declared to one (if not more) of the

And at the &s;ame time his emi&s;&s;aries were indefaticable in trumpeting it about to people in town and country, and even in the &s;treets, that my letter was a mo&s;t &s;piteful, malicious, &s;currilous thing, and Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s a harmle&s;s, ju&s;t, and hand&s;ome letter.

"What then, &s;ays he, does this give him a right to publi&s;h them with|out my con&s;ent!" Yes, &s;ay I, becau&s;e he and his adherents endeavored "to palm it upon the world," that they were ju&s;t, good and nece&s;&s;ary, yea, even <HI>meek</HI> letters, and that mine were bad and abu&s;ive to the la&s;t degree. "But what right had I to publi&s;h his letters any more than his &s;ermon without his con&s;ent?" I an&s;wer, the ca&s;e is va&s;tly different; but if they were exactly parrellel, there are many ca&s;es wherein it is nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h the whole or part of mini&s;ter's &s;ermons, particularly when they preach fal&s;e doctrine, and per&s;i&s;t in it after due admoniti|on. It is an old &s;aying <HI>that a mini&s;ter</HI>'s <HI>&s;ermon</HI> is no longer his own when he hath preached it. His hearers then have a right to take notice of it when, and how they plea&s;e, e&s;pecially if he hath deliver|ed
<PB N="98" REF="012739_0095_0F8BEB0183A84F50">any thing that is wrong, and will not confe&s;s it, after proper means have been u&s;ed to bring him to confe&s;&s;ion. Upon the whole here, what means all this heat about the letters? either they were <HI>ju&s;t and good,</HI> or they were <HI>bad:</HI> if the former, who ever made &s;uch an ado before about having their <HI>good deeds</HI> publi&s;hed to the world? ought he not rather to thank me for it? if they were <HI>bad,</HI> why did he not confe&s;s it, and &s;o put an end to the controver|&s;y? I had left the communion (though not the meeting) upon the account of the letters, and was a&s;per&s;ed for it with the utmo&s;t diligence, as hav|ing done it without &s;ufficient grounds; Mr. <HI>R.</HI> ju&s;tified his conduct in every part, and endeavored to prejudice people again&s;t me all manner of ways; he even cried out of <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> in the pulpit. What would I then do? what remedy had I left but to publi&s;h the letters, and let the church and world know how injuriou&s;ly I was treated? I know it will &s;ignify nothing with tho&s;e that will not &s;o much as read my book; but I tru&s;t the impartial world will weigh things in an even ballance, and that they will acquit me from the heinous charges he brings again&s;t me as having acted "contrary to <HI>all</HI> the rules of <HI>politene&s;s, humanity and chri&s;tianity;</HI>" and "<HI>below</HI> the character of a <HI>man of benevolence and up|rightne&s;s.</HI>" Yea, mu&s;t he not acquit me him&s;elf? for if "I had wronged him 30 times more by my letter than he had me (as he has declared over and over) I had expo&s;ed my&s;elf 30 times more by the publication than I did him. If he <HI>believes him&s;elf,</HI> believes his own declarations, how can he ju&s;tly fault me for what I have done? at le&s;t how can he cry out of wrong and injury, when I had been on|ly wronging my&s;elf? is all this concern manife&s;ted merely out of regard to my reputation? I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any more about the publication of the letters, though I could add many other particulars, if it were needful, in my own vindica|tion. I would only further notice, that the de&s;ign of this fearful outcry &s;eems to be to divert people's minds from <HI>the merits of the cau&s;e,</HI> and to turn their attention from the abu&s;es I have received, that I
<PB N="99" REF="012739_0096_0F913FFFC4E883F8">might have none to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;eeking re|lief; as a &s;ubtle bird will flutter and cry and run on, in order to draw people further from their ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus cha&s;ti&s;ed me for the <HI>publication</HI> of the letters, he next proceeds to con&s;ider the <HI>contents</HI> of them. He fir&s;t tells us, "they contained his real &s;entiments, and that he had never &s;een cau&s;e to alter them." <HI>p.</HI> 61. Pray then what did he con|fe&s;s at our meeting? for he would bear the world in hand, that he offered me <HI>all proper &s;atisfaction:</HI> but this now appears by his own words to be no|thing at all. Alas! what a cheat did he de&s;ign to put upon me by a few doubtful words artfully put together? he then gives his grounds for writing. 1&s;t. "That I had delivered things of VERY danger|ous tendency." Let the reader look into my 3d. E&s;&s;ay, and he will &s;ee that this is without founda|tion. 2d. "That I had gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented him." How? by &s;aying that he "was for obliging per&s;ons to come immediately into full communion." (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 26.) This could not be a <HI>ground</HI> of his writing, becau&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion was never read in public, but was afterwards added, when I tran|&s;cribed the E&s;&s;ays for the pre&s;s, by way of expla|nation. But however the thing is true; he is for <HI>obliging</HI> them two ways. 1&s;t. By denying them any privilege, if they will not come immediately into full communion. 2d. By intimating frequently, that the church ought to call them to an account, if they do not come.</P>
<P>He adds as another ground of his writing, "that I had charged him with <HI>&s;peaking &s;lightingly of relati|ons." p.</HI> 62. How &s;hort is his memory? this pa&s;&s;age was not contained in any of my E&s;&s;ays, but is only to be found in my an&s;wer to his letter. And how could he tell without a prophetic &s;pirit what I would write before-hand? or how could that be a ground of writing his letter, which was not wrote till after I had received his letter? this &s;hows in what a carele&s;s random manner he makes his re|marks. Other in&s;tances will occur pre&s;ently. As for the other things that I charge him with, re|&s;pecting
<PB N="100" REF="012739_0097_0F8BE2045596CF48">relations, he plainly owns them to be true. <HI>p.</HI> 63. And as to the phra&s;e <HI>&s;peaking &s;lightingly</HI> &amp;c. the chief I meant by it was, that he &s;lighted <HI>the u&s;e</HI> of them, by holding them unnece&s;&s;ary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he plainly confe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of mi&s;repre&s;entation he &s;ays is in <HI>p.</HI> 32. of the E&s;&s;ays, wherein I a&s;&s;ert, "that the new plan &s;uppo&s;es it nece&s;&s;ary that candidates have a certain knowlege or a&s;&s;urance of their gra|cious &s;tate." My words are, "the new plan &s;up|po&s;es it nece&s;&s;ary, that all candidates &s;hould have clear evidence, if not a&s;&s;urance of their regene|rate &s;tate" As much as to &s;ay, that if they do not hold <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> yet at le&s;t they hold <HI>clear evidences</HI> to be nece&s;&s;ary. And is not this the ca&s;e? &s;urely he does not hold that <HI>dark evidence</HI> is &s;ufficient. Again, under the &s;ame head, I u&s;e the term <HI>good evidence;</HI> and does he think, that <HI>bad evidence</HI> will do? he then goes further than I. What little ground then had he for that exclamation in his letter; "you, &s;ir, do <HI>certainly know,</HI> that neither I nor they hold to &s;uch things as you there advanced as being our &s;entiments?" which is founded upon this pa&s;|&s;age of the E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>Another mi&s;repre&s;entation is, "that he was for driving on with <HI>violence. p.</HI> 63. Let any one read over his letters again, and they will find <HI>violence</HI> enough. In what a jehu-like manner does he drive on? what method does he take to terrify me and others from free-&s;peaking and oppo&s;ing him in public any more? be&s;ides many other proofs, that might be mentioned, but I mu&s;t not write a volume.</P>
<P>A third rea&s;on of writing his letter was "the unfair methods I took, working upon people's pa&s;|&s;ions in&s;tead of rea&s;on, <HI>&amp;c. p.</HI> 63.&mdash; In his letter he repre&s;ents <HI>the whole</HI> of my piece to be of this teno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but now it &s;eems it was only two or three &s;hort pa&s;&s;ages. The re&s;t then mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed to "their rea&s;on and judgment." And why would not he allow me to mix a word or two of the <HI>pathetic</HI> with this? it would be a dry piece indeed, if there was nothing &s;aid to move the affections in &s;uch a con|cerning
<PB N="101" REF="012739_0098_0F8BE206949AD760">point, no le&s;s than the unchurching our children. And that it was really an unchurching or <HI>excommunicating</HI> them, I think has been fully proved; &s;o that I appealed to men's rea&s;on and judgment, as well as pa&s;&s;ions in the ca&s;e. I mu&s;t add here, if the&s;e baptized childred are <HI>lambs</HI> (as he &s;eems to grant, <HI>p.</HI> 64.) they ought to be treated as <HI>lambs,</HI> not as <HI>dogs</HI> only to be whiped. <HI>Whipping</HI> is indeed &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>children,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> to be whiped is to treat them wor&s;e than <HI>dogs.</HI> For he &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, that they are <HI>the &s;ubjects of di&s;cipline,</HI> in &s;ome parts of his book (though I can not find that he di|rectly a&s;&s;erts it) when he laments the want of di&s;ci|pline. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As for the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>"&s;prung from hell"</HI> p. 65. Do not all practices that are "wrong and erroneous" &s;pring from hell? And mu&s;t not the brethren ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;ay, this practice &s;prung from thence, if they voted it out? mu&s;t I then be faulted for &s;peak|ing of things as they are? or for repre&s;enting the truth in a &s;trong light? is he afraid of the light?</P>
<P>The next "unfair method I u&s;ed, was, quoting <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lxvi. 5." <HI>p.</HI> 62, 5. Concerning this I think I have &s;aid enough in my letter, which he takes not the lea&s;t notice of, but goes on to repre&s;ent things in the wor&s;t colors. If he will have it after all that I pronounced <HI>cur&s;es</HI> upon him; let me tell him, the cur&s;e &s;eems <HI>already</HI> come, upon him in full weight and mea&s;ure, and I hope and pray that he never may feel it in higher degrees: the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> is <HI>&s;hame.</HI> And is it not evident from his conduct, that he is <HI>really and greatly a&s;hamed of his letters,</HI> tho' he be too <HI>haughty</HI> to own it? how comes he el&s;e to call me "unpolite, inhuman, and unchri&s;tian" in publi&s;hing them? and why &s;uch a noi&s;e about it for many months to|gether? I wonder he had not brought a new charge of <HI>cur&s;ing</HI> upon my reminding him of that text, <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 6. in my letter. (See E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 43.) He hath &s;uch a knack at commenting, he might have made it appear in as hedious a light as the text under con&s;ideration. As to my pointing at him when I read the text, I have no remembrance of it. <HI>I</HI> have a common motion of one hand when &s;peaking in
<PB N="102" REF="012739_0099_0F8BE20724931150">public, which he might take for pointing, as I &s;tood facing him. As for addre&s;&s;ing the <HI>baptized in general,</HI> as he repre&s;ents both in <HI>p.</HI> 62, and 65. it is utterly unfair to give &s;uch a repre&s;entation to the world. I only &s;pake to tho&s;e of <HI>"good conver&s;ation:" many</HI> of whom &s;tood ready to renew their bapti&s;mal cove|nant, as he him&s;elf tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 65. but were prevent|ed by his &s;hutting the door again&s;t them. And I thought I ought to give them a word of comfort under the dark cloud that was hanging over them. And as I had then, &s;o I have &s;till a &s;trong faith, that this practice will never be wholly bani&s;hed out of this church, though it may be &s;u&s;pended for a while. Perhaps after I am dead and gone, the&s;e words may be remembered. The promi&s;e is &s;ure. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lvii. 17. 1&s;t. <HI>cl.</HI></P>
<P>With this text, he couples a &s;entence belonging to another head "the plea or pretence is grace." But is not the word pretence or preten&s;ion &s;ome|times u&s;ed in a good &s;en&s;e? but if it be taken in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e, is there no grounds for it? no doubt <HI>many</HI> act &s;incerely and con&s;cienciou&s;ly in the affair: but can it be deemed any other than <HI>pretence</HI> in tho&s;e that take the mo&s;t <HI>ungracious methods</HI> to propa|gate the cau&s;e? filling the whole town and country with lyes and fal&s;e repre&s;entations: dropping the mo&s;t notorious libels in the &s;treets, or po&s;ting them up in public places; printing a mo&s;t infamous adverti&s;ement, to bla&s;t the credit of my book and the author? endeavoring to get the book &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed or burnt, by carring the mo&s;t barefaced fal&s;e|hoods to the printer! and many other &s;uch like things? but who hath done this? none I believe doubts but that &s;ome of the <HI>warme&s;t zealots</HI> in the affair had a principal hand in the whole. And what can it be but <HI>pretence</HI> in one of the hotte&s;t advocates for the new &s;cheme, who in former years actually owned the covenant among us, but hath not as yet come to full communion? can a man be <HI>&s;incere</HI> in fighting again&s;t him&s;elf?</P>
<P>He concludes about his letter with ob&s;erving, "That <HI>all the while</HI> I was treating of this affair at the church-meeting, I appeared to be in as great

And that this was the ob&s;ervation of <HI>multitudes,</HI> as well as his own." <HI>p.</HI> 65. But there was not multitudes there, how then could they ob&s;erve it? I am &s;ure I never heard of &s;uch an ob&s;ervation made by the &s;pectators be|fore.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been informed, that the few <HI>indifferent</HI> &s;pectators from other pari&s;hes, univer&s;ally ob&s;erved after the meeting, that the anger and vehemence was all on the other &s;ide.</NOTE> And is not this ob&s;ervation utterly repug|nant to the tenor of his letter? we hear nothing there of anger and bad temper, but only of "pa&s;&s;i|onate exclamations and pathetic addre&s;&s;es, and &s;eem|ing affectionatene&s;s, popular harangues, and appeals to men's pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Even &s;uch an <HI>artful method</HI> in general, as tended to gain the populace and to fill their minds with prejudices again&s;t his."

I am &s;ure I did not read my piece in an angry tone and accent, (of this he him&s;elf clears me in his letter: I was &s;ilent the much greater part of the meeting, being not well: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at with patience to hear him read his <HI>collection</HI> (though I thought it not much to the purpo&s;e) which la&s;ted about an hour and a quarter or more.

Although it be the <HI>highe&s;t indig|nity,</HI> that can be offered to a man in the literary world, I did not &s;o much as let him know I heard him; which &s;hows, that I had &s;ome command of my pa&s;&s;ions. And the only times I &s;pake with heat was, when he broke in upon me and interrupted me in reading my piece, endeavoring to hinder my going on, (which he did frequently:) and I think this was a ju&s;t ground of re&s;entment; e&s;pecially when I had patiently and without interruption heard his piece, which was more than as long again as mine. At the&s;e times, I claimed my pri|vilege with &s;ome warmth; and told him, that as a member I had a right to &s;peak, and would &s;peak, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And by this means I at la&s;t got through, though with much difficulty.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould &s;ay, he interrupted me, becau&s;e I would not give others opportunity to &s;peak, and becau&s;e our &s;ide monopolized mo&s;t of the talk to them&s;elves. This could not be the ca&s;e; for none of his &s;ide of the que&s;tion ever attempted to &s;peak to the <HI>merits of the cau&s;e</HI> in any of our meetings, except he him&s;elf: (&s;o that, altho' <HI>"the mo&s;t godly,"</HI> they did not manife&s;t any <HI>&s;uper-eminence of knowlege.</HI>) we &s;hould have been <HI>glad</HI> to have heard them, if they had had any thing to &s;ay, and would readily have given way: but they &s;eemed all to depend upon him, and implicitly to receive what he &s;aid for truth. And as for him&s;elf, he argued as much and as long as he plea&s;ed, without interruption.</P>

In &s;omething the like &s;ort, (though not &s;o gro&s;ly) he treated deacon <HI>F.</HI> The deacon in the preceed|ing meetings had &s;aid but little; but was now determined to &s;peak his whole mind, and argue the point at &s;ome length. He began&mdash;but had &s;carce uttered a &s;entence or two, before Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (who &s;tood facing him) attempting to an&s;wer, and &s;o kept doing as fa&s;t as the deacon uttered any thing new, (though he begged not to be interrupt|ed) that after a few minutes he was forced to de&s;i&s;t. And hath had no opportunity of declar|ing his full &s;entiments to the church to this day. Of this the deacon much complained the evening after. And another of the deacons he endeavor|ed to &s;top in the &s;ame manner while &s;peaking; but when that would not do, he (with a peremp|tory tone and with a &s;lap of his hand on the &s;eat) bad him <HI>&s;it down;</HI> which the deacon readily obeyed.</P>
<P>But was there no pa&s;&s;ion on Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s &s;ide at this meet|ing? we hear not a word of that.

<PB N="106" REF="012739_0103_0F8BE20E84A56460">that he hath not got over it to this day, although I made him &s;omething of a confe&s;&s;ion in my letter. (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 39.) But how did his pa&s;&s;ion manife&s;t it&s;elf at the meeting? why he appeared to be in the greate&s;t agitation; &s;ometimes &s;itting down, then &s;uddenly &s;tarting up, then &s;itting and ri&s;ing again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> talking to him&s;elf, blurting out &s;hort &s;entences to tho&s;e that &s;tood near him, &s;haking his head, &s;cowling, (not to &s;ay <HI>grinning</HI>) &s;tamping, fre|quent interrupting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In &s;hort, he appeared to be in as great a tempe&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, as ever I &s;aw a man in my life, (and &s;o but an ill judge of other's pa&s;&s;ions). And his whole deportment during the two la&s;t meetings was unbecoming a <HI>moderator,</HI> (not to &s;ay more:) in&s;omuch that I have frequently &s;aid, that if the <HI>moderator</HI> of a town-meeting, or the <HI>&s;peaker</HI> of the general a&s;&s;embly &s;hould behave in &s;uch manner, they would be in danger of being thrown off the bench with violence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For &s;uch rea&s;ons as the&s;e, the deacons a&s;ked the advice of an ordination council at <HI>Middleborough</HI> a few weeks after, whether it were not proper for the church to have <HI>another moderator</HI> (viz. a neighboring mini&s;|ter) at the next meeting. They did not indeed give a <HI>particular detail</HI> of their <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> out of <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> but only in general, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> being one party and the church the other, whether it would not be advi&s;able upon this ground? But Mr. <HI>R.</HI> who was pre&s;ent, would not hear a word of it, though, as I am informed, the mini&s;ters <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> to it; which advice Mr. <HI>R.</HI> wholly denied <HI>in the face of the church,</HI> when reminded of it at the next meeting.</P>
<P>I now come to his animadver&s;ions on my letter. And here upon entrance I mu&s;t note, that he whol|ly omits one thing with which he inflamed com|mon people as much as any thing; my calling him <HI>"&s;chool-boy."</HI> (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 41.) This was long in every one's mouth, but it &s;eems it would not bear publi|cation. Another thing omitted is, "the glaring incon&s;i&s;tencies in my letter, which he forebore pointing out, lea&s;t it &s;hould put me to pain." (See his 2d. letter. <HI>p.</HI> 49.) We hear not a word of this in his book. Perhaps he &s;till forebore, out of tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="012739_0104_0F8BE20F46B03050">to me, lea&s;t he &s;hould "give me &s;ome pain and unea&s;ine&s;s." He likewi&s;e omits remarking about "his provoking letters to the precinct committee." This was too tender a &s;tring to touch upon. I believe they would have proved fatal to him, if they had been brought into public; but we of the committee endeavored to &s;tifle them: &s;o far were <HI>we</HI> from &s;eeking his hurt; though we were cen&s;ured by many for it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he animadverts upon is, that it is intimated in the E&s;&s;ays, "he had turned away or <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> &s;ome who had offered to own the covenant." <HI>p.</HI> 65. It is amazing to me, that &s;uch &s;tre&s;s is laid upon this. The que&s;tion I believe has been put &s;cores of times, both in church-meeting and out, by him&s;elf and others, <HI>"who was ever denied?"</HI> and with|al added, that it is time enough to complain, and to have church-meetings, when in&s;tances of refu&s;al appear, and individuals enter complaint of being debared. But is not a <HI>general denial</HI> equivalent to a thou&s;and particular ones? has he not denied them in his &s;ermons, in all his di&s;cour&s;es public and pri|vate, for above two years pa&s;t, yea, and in his book, <HI>p.</HI> 2. "I thought it my duty (&s;ays he there) to de&s;i&s;t the practice?" And yet he &s;till dins us with this que&s;tion, <HI>who was ever denied?</HI> it makes me perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick to hear &s;o much of it. He tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 65. "<HI>many</HI> have frequently di&s;cour&s;ed with him on the affair, and wi&s;hed that it might be peaceably &s;ettled, that they might bring their children." <HI>i. e.</HI> They wi&s;h|ed that he would take off the bar he had laid in their way, and allow them to come. And is not this all the <HI>application,</HI> that per&s;ons can well make under the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things? but the <HI>particular per&s;on</HI> he refers to, went much further than this; he di&s;cour&s;ed with him no le&s;s than 3 times on the affair, with direct de&s;ign to have been admitted, if he would have &s;uffered it; nay, he went &s;o far as to tell him, that if he could not have his children baptized, he would apply to Mr. <HI>T&mdash;n,</HI> the church mini&s;ter, though he did not indeed in terms a&s;k him to propound him the next &s;abbath. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> would no doubt have been affronted if he had gone
<PB N="108" REF="012739_0105_0F8BE1FF9155BA98">&s;o far as this, after he had &s;o fully declared his principles.</P>
<P>The next thing is, "that I give a wrong turn to that expre&s;&s;ion of his, <HI>the mo&s;t godly</HI> among us, both men and women, are on his &s;ide." <HI>p.</HI> 65. The ex|pre&s;&s;ion is &s;o plain in it&s;elf, that it is incapable of a <HI>wrong turn,</HI> though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e endeavors to give it, but in vain.</P>
<P>He then faults me "for expre&s;&s;ing <HI>my fears,</HI> that he conver&s;es too little with his flock to pa&s;s a judg|ment, who are the mo&s;t godly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" <HI>p.</HI> 66 For my part I never heard of any <HI>pa&s;toral vi&s;its,</HI> except to the <HI>&s;ick</HI> or <HI>bereaved.</HI> But I have frequently heard com|plaints, that he vi&s;ited but little, except a few in|dividuals. How then could he know much who "lived neare&s;t to God, or who enjoyed mo&s;t of the life, power and &s;weetne&s;s of experimental religion?" He hath indeed vi&s;ited greatly, and almo&s;t univer&s;|ally for about fifteen months pa&s;t. But I am apt to think that the di&s;cour&s;e hath been generally taken up with <HI>&s;omething el&s;e</HI> be&s;ides experiences. And I &s;uppo&s;e the real foundation he goes upon in a&s;&s;erting, that he hath the mo&s;t godly on his &s;ide, is this, the brethren with him, &s;everal of them, were received by him&s;elf, and &s;o he had particular occa&s;ion and opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with them about their acquaintance with experimental religi|on. But as to the members received in Mr. <HI>Leonard's</HI> days, I believe he &s;carce knows any thing about them, except &s;uch as have particularly applied to him under di&s;tre&s;s of con&s;cience. "I utter this with chri&s;tian temper," and as my real per&s;ua&s;ion: perhaps he would not believe me if I added, "that I <HI>felt good natured</HI>" too, and heartily pitied him that he was <HI>left</HI> to give &s;uch wrong accounts to the world.</P>
<P>"As for his being more a <HI>favorite</HI> with the women than I am," <HI>p.</HI> 66. He him&s;elf acknowleges, that he could &s;ee nothing ami&s;s in the expre&s;&s;ion. But &s;ome elbow friend hath &s;ugge&s;ted, that I had <HI>a bad de&s;ign</HI> in it. And he &s;eems ready upon it to "demand an <HI>explanation.</HI>" All the explanation I &s;hall give him is, that it is <HI>his voice</HI> and nothing el&s;e <HI>(nihil pre|terea)</HI> that has produced this effect. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that he &s;hould take &s;uch notice of this pa&s;&s;age as he here does, or indeed any notice of it at all. But
<PB N="109" REF="012739_0106_0F8BE21004993730">what opportunity does he mi&s;s to bring an "odium" upon me among his more thoughtle&s;s hearers? can not one man be more favored than another, even by <HI>women,</HI> without "&s;ome reflection on his cha|racter?" it would then be a dangerous thing to be a <HI>popular preacher.</HI></P>

As to "the <HI>brethren's</HI> being involved in the &s;ame doom," it is as evident as the light, that all that hold the &s;ame principles as I do (whether mini|&s;ters or brethren) are as guilty as I am, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tand or fall with me.</P>

With which Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was gratified; and he told me him&s;elf the &s;ame week, "that Mr. <HI>H&mdash;t's</HI> &s;ermon and di&s;cour&s;e after meeting, had gi|ven him a new train of ideas, and things appeared to him in quite a different light from what they did before." And &s;ince that, his preaching has been generally in quite another &s;train and tenor; and people I believe have univer&s;ally thought, that he was come off from his former notions. But now it &s;eems, "he hath never retracted or &s;een cau&s;e to retract any &s;entiments in divinity, which he formerly held, but &s;till thinks them agreable to the word of God." Hear this, O people and con|&s;ider. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;till holds the &s;ame principles (he tells you &s;o him&s;elf) which in former years filled you with grief and unea&s;ine&s;s, and cau&s;ed many tears.

<P>WE think it our duty to te&s;tify our di&s;like of the doct|rine delivered ye&s;terday. It was then advanced, that regeneration was wrought by a divine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> act, <HI>without,</HI> and independent of all means, and previous to faith, repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which we apprehended contrary to the &s;cripture. For 1&s;t. the apo&s;tles over and over a&s;|&s;ert, that regeneration is wrought through means. <HI>I have begotten you, &s;ays</HI> Paul, <HI>through the go&s;|pel. Beholding as in a gla&s;s</HI> (i. e. the word ap|plied) <HI>the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the &s;ame image,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Of his own will be|gat he us with the word of truth. Being born again, not of corruptible &s;eed, but of in|corruptible, by the word of God. By the great and precious promi&s;es, we become partakers of the divine nature,</HI> &amp;c. 2d. The doctrine ad|vanced makes union to Chri&s;t no <HI>part,</HI> but an <HI>effect</HI> of regeneration, whereas it is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential part</HI> of rege|neration. <HI>If a man be in Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>he is a new creature,</HI> new-born, <HI>2 Cor. v. 17.</HI> and regeneration is de&s;cribed by this phra&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t liveth in me.</HI> Gal. <HI>iii. 20. He that hath the &s;on, hath life,</HI> &s;ays St. John, <HI>and he that hath not the &s;on of God, hath not life. 1</HI> John <HI>v. 12.</HI> 3d. This contradicts the apo&s;tle, when he &s;ays, <HI>faith comes by hearing:</HI> according to this new doctrine it comes from regeneration, and not from hearing and applying the word. All the proof you brought for your new doctrine was from <HI>John i. 12.13.</HI> which is nothing to the purpo&s;e: for <HI>receiving Chri&s;t</HI> is in the pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter-perfect ten&s;e, as well as <HI>being born,</HI> &amp;c. which implies that they are coeval, or really the &s;ame thing in other words. Whereas according to you; <HI>receiving Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e, and <HI>being born</HI> in the praeter perfect, contrary to the very letter of the text. Upon the whole, we apprehend your notion of regeneration to be a mere <HI>chimera,</HI> and that it never had an exi&s;tence but in the brain of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and his followers. We re&s;t your di&s;&s;atisfied brethren.</P>

<P>This, though a <HI>private letter, and de&s;igned</HI> as &s;uch, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> immediately publi&s;hed (without returning us any an&s;|wer either by word or writing) pre&s;ently after taking hor&s;e, and communicating it about the town; and in his return reading it at the water &s;ide in the open air to a company gathered round him. And the next &s;abbath, the whole affair was carried to <HI>Plimpton</HI> upon a change. And the &s;abbath after we were la&s;hed to purpo&s;e, he endeavoring to refute our paper; though by the way he &s;aid nothing about the <HI>in&s;trumentaliy of the word.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

He, in fine, appears much chagrined at a para|graph in my letter, which he &s;till &s;ays was "wrote on the &s;abbath." <HI>p.</HI> 68. It is &s;trange he keeps in|&s;i&s;ting on this, when I had told him it was wrote in the evening (when according to his principles) the &s;abbath was ended. The paragraph related to that pa&s;&s;age in his prayer, <HI>let them not &s;hun,</HI> &amp;c. (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 47.) And this was &s;poken, I am per&s;uad|ed, when he was under an <HI>impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e</HI> of <HI>&s;omething el&s;e</HI> be&s;ides divine things;" for he &s;poke in an an|gry tone and with vehemence, "as his manner is," when he is preaching again&s;t <HI>lay-teachers,</HI> or tho&s;e that tax him with fal&s;e doctrine. As to what fol|lows, "that he had omitted many heads of divini|ty in his preaching," I am really &s;orry for his &s;ake that I &s;at it down. But it came in &s;o apprope, that I could not well omit it. But alas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is too true. He confines him&s;elf chiefly to <HI>affectionate &s;ub|jects,</HI> and neglects explaining doctrines, and the nature of ordinances too much. (Which I have heard ob&s;erved and lamented by others as well as my&s;elf.<NOTE N="&dtristar;" PLACE="foot">Behold the man, that cries out of the publi&s;hing private letters!</NOTE>) So that I fear <HI>ignorance</HI> will greatly pre|vail
<PB N="115" REF="012739_0112_0F8BEA4ADE634818">in the next generation: and indeed &s;ome have occa&s;ionally ob&s;erved to me, that it does &s;o too much already; more than ever was known before in this town: (one proof of it is <HI>their readine&s;s,</HI> yea, <HI>even fondne&s;s to be unchurched or excommunicated,</HI> upon Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s bare word, without exhibiting any valid evidence; as &s;ure there was none before his book came out, whatever there is now.) On this head of <HI>preaching</HI> I could &s;ay much more, but my heart recoils at the thought. I would gladly have omit|ed this and &s;everal other paragraphs in <HI>printing</HI> the letters out of regard to him; but I knew what a fearful outcry (wor&s;e than "cants") would have been rai&s;ed, that I had <HI>altered</HI> the letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that I &s;at down every <HI>iota.</HI> I &s;hould have freely told him my thoughts upon this and &s;everal other heads "in a friendly manner," if he had given op|portunity by frequent vi&s;its and an unre&s;erved in|timacy; but it &s;eems he thought it be&s;t to keep at a di&s;tance (except in his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing hours.) And if I had gone to his hou&s;e to have talked of &s;uch things, &s;uch is his temper, that he would have been apt to have con&s;trued it <HI>in&s;ult,</HI> and I might have expected to have heard it proclaimed (as he is little capable of keeping &s;ecrets, to my di&s;ad|vantage. I have had experience of &s;omething of this kind, and &s;o have others. Upon the whole here, if in&s;tead of taking offence, and turning it into a je&s;t, he had reformed and enlarged his plan of preaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it would have been much better. But I am informed, he &s;till goes on in the old track, chiefly, if not wholly, confining him&s;elf to <HI>affectionate &s;ubjects</HI> and herein even abounding more and more, which &s;eems calculated to retain the affections of his hearers. And further to captivate, he preaches of late much <HI>without notes,</HI> by rea&s;on of which much <HI>crude matter</HI> (I hear) is poured forth as well as repetitions, the &s;ame thing recurring over and over.</P>
<P>Having done with the letters, he comes to what he calls "my catalogue of charges." <HI>p.</HI> 69. The reader will ob&s;erve, that they are <HI>bare facts,</HI> &s;et down without the lea&s;t comment. How far is this
<PB N="116" REF="012739_0113_0F8BEA4B80F719D0">from his treatment of me? ill-natured comments, and the wor&s;t con&s;tructions occurring every where. The&s;e charges were, it &s;eems "a potion as bitter" as aloes. Yet have they not had "&s;alutary effects?" Have they not in a great mea&s;ure prevented irretat|ing things being brought into the pulpit, which were &s;o frequent before? but being pent up there, he gives him&s;elf the more vent in his book, and in his abundant vi&s;its. But how does he clear him|&s;elf from the&s;e charges? &s;ome are not mentioned, therefore &s;tand confe&s;&s;ed, as that of <HI>hi&s;&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c. "Pointed p&s;alms" he denies; and &s;ays, "the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> were &s;ung in cour&s;e." But did he &s;ing the 12th p&s;alm in cour&s;e? this was &s;ung the &s;abbath before the la&s;t church-meeting; and it would have come in cour&s;e in about 3 weeks or a month: but it &s;eems he &s;kipt over 4 or 5 p&s;alms to come at it: and then returned back. When this <HI>p&s;alm</HI> was read, tho&s;e that were in the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> of that meeting were variou&s;ly affected, &s;everal were upon the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ter, and one man was ob&s;erved to bow down his head, and thru&s;t his handkerchief in his mouth, that he might not be &s;een to laugh. This was in the forenoon. In the afternoon, the <HI>p&s;alms</HI> are not &s;ung in cour&s;e; &s;o that he is at liberty to &s;uit all occa&s;ions. And whether he had not the&s;e debates &s;ometimes in mind, the reader may judge by omit|ting that &s;tanza, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xviii. 17. when he came to it in cour&s;e, wherein are the&s;e words, <HI>"the weak de|fence that I could make." (Tate</HI> and <HI>Brady.</HI>) Which might be pa&s;&s;ed lea&s;t <HI>profane wits</HI> &s;hould <HI>burle&s;que</HI> and <HI>&s;coff.</HI> Sometimes &s;ome of his &s;trong adherents have ob&s;erved after meeting, that he &s;uited the <HI>p&s;alm</HI> to the times, or "that there was a <HI>p&s;alm</HI> for us."</P>
<P>As for the <HI>&s;ermon of triumph,</HI> he tells us, "It was made above a month before the church-meeting, and therefore he could not po&s;&s;ibly know, or even <HI>&s;u&s;|pect</HI> what would then be done." I never heard be|fore, nor I believe any one el&s;e of his making a &s;tock of &s;ermons before-hand. How comes he then &s;o often to preach old &s;ermons? But to let that pa&s;s. How various have been the reports about this &s;er|mon?
<PB N="117" REF="012739_0114_0F8BE2034589B598">Sometimes it was &s;aid, that it was made a fortnight, &s;ometimes 3 weeks before the meeting, &s;ometimes that he had only begun it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But be that as it will, how can he &s;ay "that he did not <HI>even &s;u&s;pect</HI> what would be done at that meeting, when it was determined in the <HI>conclave</HI> what &s;hould be done? for one of his <HI>privy council</HI> told about pub|licly, near <HI>two months</HI> before the meeting, "that they de&s;igned to have no more debates on the affair, but that the meeting &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved." And an agent or agents were accordingly &s;ecretly &s;ent about to get the major part of the members to &s;ign for a di&s;&s;olution; &s;o that the &s;ermon might be made in pro&s;pect of &s;uch an event; which I doubt not they deemed as certain. Here I would ob&s;erve, that he preached 4 &s;ermons from that text <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> liv. 17. So that it was not a &s;ingle &s;ermon we controvert about. The fir&s;t &s;abbath he carried the matter &s;o far, that he &s;eemed to make us all open enemies and adver|&s;aries of the church, &s;eeking it's de&s;truction by pro|moting fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this making a great noi&s;e, and producing &s;evere reflections, even from &s;ome of his own &s;ide, he found, no doubt, that he had carried the matter too far; &s;o that when the text came next under con&s;ideration, a fortnight after, he &s;eemed to make a &s;ort of retraction, re-a&s;|&s;uming the fir&s;t head (which to appearance he had fini&s;hed) and &s;hewed how even <HI>good men</HI> might, thro' <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>mi&s;take,</HI> do that which was prejudicial to the church's welfare, and were &s;o far enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which we may add, that the fir&s;t &s;abbath he preached from the text, the congregation &s;eem|ed all alive, and &s;uch whi&s;perings there was after the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ervices, as I &s;carce ever &s;aw before; or &s;uch di&s;cour&s;ings on both &s;ides, after people had got out of the meeting-hou&s;e; &s;ome &s;aying, "they hoped deacon <HI>F.</HI> Mr. <HI>C.</HI> &amp;c. had got their belly full, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And will he after all bear the world in hand, that he had "no de&s;ign" in tho&s;e &s;ermons, "and that the thing was too low and ridiculous to mention, being founded on nothing but &s;urmize and jealou&s;y," and that "he always &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided every thing that might be look|ed
<PB N="118" REF="012739_0115_0F8BEA4C81F841D8">upon as pointed, or tending to irritate?" Upon the whole, whether the&s;e &s;ermons were "&s;ermons of triumph" or not, whether they had a retro&s;pect, and looked backward or forward, or whether they are rightfully or wrongfully named in the E&s;&s;ays, the&s;e things are not material. It is certain the &s;itu|ation of the times gave birth to them, they were <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> and <HI>evidently pointed,</HI> and of this we complain.</P>
<P>As for the phra&s;e "my friends and my enemies," the town can better judge of the truth of it than tho&s;e that live at a di&s;tance (except the mini&s;ters of his acquaintance) and to them I leave it.</P>
<P>I come now to the <HI>cruelle&s;t</HI> part of his whole reply, it is filled with untrue &s;ugge&s;tions and &s;ur|mi&s;es, calculated to repre&s;ent me as one of the wor&s;t of men, having a heart fraught with malice and revenge, and bearing old grudges from year to year, and wanting nothing but an opportunity to mani|fe&s;t and vent it&s;elf, and all without the lea&s;t grounds, and even in &s;uch degree as he could not have thought po&s;&s;ible before. <HI>p.</HI> 70, 71. "But pray let us get away from the noi&s;e of a torrent, and calmly enquire what it is that occa&s;ioned all this vehemence." Why, it &s;eems chiefly founded upon a <HI>letter</HI> I &s;ent him many years ago. But this he will not publi&s;h, being of a <HI>private nature,</HI> lea&s;t he &s;hould follow my <HI>bad example.</HI> But did he not publi&s;h it in the time of it all over the pari&s;h, and even carry it to the a&s;&s;ociation? and does he not <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than publi&s;h it now, giving hints that it contains &s;omething very bad, even &s;o bad that it would not bear the light? and all this he hath done, without ever an&s;wering the letter, or ex|changing one word with me about it from the time it was wrote to this day. I have had frequent intimations coming directly from him, that he de&s;igned to publi&s;h this letter at full length in his reply, but it &s;eems &s;ome friend hath di&s;&s;uaded him from it, le&s;t it &s;hould expo&s;e him after his great outcry of publi&s;hing private letters. But he hath taken a method ten-fold more injurious. But what dreadful things were contained in that letter? the ca&s;e was this; he hath di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition for

To this end he and his 2 emi&s;|&s;aries have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s for a 12 month pa&s;t to repre&s;ent me every where, "as an impla|cable, malicious, &s;piteful, revengeful man: one who, if once offended, will never forgive or be reconcil|ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" This is their con&s;tant theme in the hou&s;e and <HI>by the way,</HI> where they think it will make impre&s;&s;ion. This they utter in di&s;cour&s;e. This they write, and this they print. But God knows, and my own con&s;cience knows, and the people lately my charge do univer&s;ally know, that this is not my di&s;po&s;ition, or turn of mind. I know I am naturally <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate:</HI> but rooted en|mity and malice, and implacability are the remote&s;t things po&s;&s;ible from my natural temper. I dare appeal to his own father (a former intimate ac|quaintance) for the truth of this; who I believe if he <HI>really knew</HI> how his &s;on managed, would be far from countenancing him: the <HI>grieving</HI> of whom
<PB N="122" REF="012739_0119_0F8BEA530883A060">is what goes as near to me as almo&s;t any thing in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.</P>
<P>But why then am I not reconciled to Mr. <HI>R?</HI> has he not &s;aid and done enough to &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable man? but do not I remain inflexible? ob&s;tinately &s;tanding out again&s;t the advice of <HI>mini|&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>brethren,</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> who all with one voice cry out, that the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> he offers is &s;ufficient? thus he hath repre&s;ented the matter to the world: how <HI>truly</HI> will pre&s;ently appear. Reconciliation was what I had at heart, and truly &s;ought, and was the <HI>fir&s;t mover</HI> in it. At my reque&s;t, deacon <HI>T.</HI> propo&s;ed a meeting to him with &s;ome brethren, he &s;eemed not much inclined to it, and the deacon was forced to go backward and forward &s;everal times before the matter was fully &s;ettled: at length he complies upon the&s;e terms, "that there &s;hould be an equal number of the brethren on both &s;ides, that the brethren &s;hould <HI>&s;ay nothing,</HI> but that all the talk &s;hould be between him and me,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief rea&s;on of this re&s;triction I &s;uppo&s;e to be, becau&s;e he thought by his voluble tongue, and great flow of words to obtain an advantage again&s;t me, and &s;o to drown and confu&s;e me, if left alone: and that he took the advantage, appears from the <HI>narrative</HI> of the whole conference drawn up by a brother pre&s;ent. <Q>Mr. <HI>C.</HI> &s;ays he, often de&s;ired time to &s;peak, told Mr. <HI>R.</HI> you break in upon me when I attempt to &s;peak, and confu&s;e me; but it &s;igni|fied no great matter, it appeared to me he did it on pur|po&s;e.</Q> I &s;hould be glad to in&s;ert the whole narrative, by which it would appear how unchri&s;tianly I was u&s;ed; but it would lengthen out the book too much. If Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, that he had another rea&s;on for this re&s;triction, namely. "becau&s;e I in&s;i&s;ted upon a particular brother's be|ing pre&s;ent, who he did not want &s;hould &s;peak." This no way militates with the rea&s;on I give, becau&s;e that brother was the mo&s;t capable of helping and a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, if there had been occa&s;ion; and perhaps he thought he could do well enough with the re&s;t, if he was ab&s;ent. If he &s;hould &s;ay, "it was not upon this account that he was for debarring that brother, but becau&s;e of his unplacable turn of mind, and that his pre&s;ence would rather hinder than promote a reconciliation." Such a &s;ugge&s;tion would be <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> to the la&s;t degree; and contrary to truth; <HI>none being more tender and helpful on &s;uch occa&s;ions</HI> (in which he had been much u&s;ed) tho' I do not think he would have &s;uffered me to have been <HI>trampled on.</HI> And be&s;ides, if Mr. <HI>R.</HI> was <HI>per&s;onally offended</HI> with him, there was more rea&s;on for his being pre&s;ent, that the recon|ciliation might have been complete. I could not con&s;ent, that &s;uch a <HI>&s;light</HI> &s;hould be put upon one of the principle members of the church; and then I wanted him as an evi|dence to &s;ome <HI>particulars,</HI> in ca&s;e I could have brought Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to have talked of them. And &s;urely it did not &s;how much of a <HI>di&s;po&s;ition for peace</HI> in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to ca&s;t &s;uch contempt on a fellow-member, and a fellow &s;ufferer with me, e&s;pecially when I did not <HI>object</HI> again&s;t any brother of his choo&s;ing, though I had much more rea&s;on for it.</NOTE> and
<PB N="123" REF="012739_0120_0F8BEA53B483D900">that there &s;hould be no di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>any particular</HI> on either &s;ide, but that we &s;hould make up in a general way." I thought the terms hard; but ra|ther than not meet, I complied; hoping to convince him of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the preliminaries, and to bring him to allow the brethren to &s;peak and mediate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of the brethren that went with me have declared &s;ince, that if they had known of the terms before-hand, they would not have gone.</NOTE> and to a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of particulars, with|out which no good end could be an&s;wered by the meet|ing. Well, we met, I carried; brethren with me, and found that he had invited 4, contrary to agree|ment. I objected not, but pre&s;ently proceeded to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting. Having lamented the difference, and expre&s;&s;ed my hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of its being peaceably healed, I endeavored to draw him into a di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome particulars, telling him <HI>that deceit lay in generals,</HI> and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ome things more particularly, or an amicable agreement could not be expected. But he utterly refu&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted on a general making up, and then declared the terms he would con&s;ent to, and nothing el&s;e; namely, "that as many things had been &s;aid on both &s;ides that had better have never been &s;aid, he was willing to make mutual conce&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="124" REF="012739_0121_0F8BEA5600AC4590">to each other, and to bury the hatchet, and that we &s;hould both forget and forgive all that was pa&s;t, and for the future live together in love." He ex|pre&s;&s;es the terms rather more largely in his book, but I am &s;atisfied this account comes nearer the truth; and &s;o &s;ay the brethren that were with me; the words being exactly cited from the narrative mentioned in the margin. I expre&s;&s;ed my di&s;&s;atis|faction with this, and told him I did not think this a proper way of healing the breach. Upon which he replied very quick, and with a great deal of warmth, "you think I have injured you, I think you have injured me 30 times more by your letter, and I think it a peice of conde&s;cention in me, to go &s;o far as I have offered." Which expre&s;&s;ions were repeated in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation. I think, more than once. After this I did, with difficulty, force him to di&s;cour&s;e a little on 3 or 4 particulars. One was about "the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> godly, being on his &s;ide." This I thought hard and uncharitable. He <HI>denied</HI> the charge, and in&s;i&s;ted that he allowed tho&s;e on our &s;ide to be <HI>equally</HI> godly, and referred to the po&s;|cript for proof. I told him he &s;pake of the one in the <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> and the other in the <HI>&s;uperlative</HI> degree, which was an evident preferrence. But &s;till he kept <HI>denying,</HI> and &s;o I left it, and let him have the la&s;t word. Another particular was about <HI>arminiani&s;m:</HI> he told me he did not call me an <HI>arminian,</HI> but only taxed me with doctrines tending to <HI>arminiani&s;m.</HI> I an&s;wered, I cared not for the name: whether he charged me with <HI>arminiani&s;m</HI> or not, he certainly charged me with <HI>dangerous and de&s;tructive doctrines, &s;uch as rendred me unfit to preach,</HI> and read part of his let|ter to prove it. This he an&s;wered with a &s;hrug.&mdash;Another thing di&s;cour&s;ed of was, about his a&s;&s;erting before the council at <HI>Middleborough,</HI> when he found he could not &s;upport the charges in his letter from any thing contained in my 3d E&s;&s;ay, which was read there, "that his letter was found|ed more on what I <HI>&s;aid</HI> at the church-meeting than on <HI>what I read,</HI> and that I &s;aid a great deal, turning my&s;elf round, and &s;winging my hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And that he &s;tood to it (before the mini&s;ters) in oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="125" REF="012739_0122_0F8BEA56E58EE9F8">to the declaration of three of the brethren, then pre&s;ent, when in reality I had <HI>&s;aid nothing</HI> dur|ing the whole meeting, relative to the point in con|trover&s;y. His an&s;wer to this was a mere <HI>eva&s;ion,</HI> namely, "that he did not know but that while I was reading, I might put in &s;omething here and there memoriter:" though he did not pretend to recollect any thing omitted in the manu&s;cript. This fal&s;ity then, was by no means cleared up. An|other thing I mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d was, his reporting about, that I never preached for him <HI>without pay.</HI> He deni|ed he had ever &s;o reported, and owned that the re|port was groundle&s;s, I having preached &s;everal times without, to his knowlege. During this di&s;cour&s;e, he would frequently call me to order, and to an ob|&s;ervance of the preliminaries, and finally refu&s;ed to go any further into particulars. And as to <HI>generals,</HI> he never &s;o much as offered to acknowlege that his letters were <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> and <HI>&s;evere,</HI> or <HI>ra&s;h</HI> and <HI>unguarded,</HI> or expre&s;&s;ed any <HI>&s;orrow</HI> or <HI>concern</HI> for the writing of them. If he had gone &s;o far as that, I would have acquie&s;ced, rather than have continued in a broil. Nay, he was &s;o far from it, that in 3 hours con|ver&s;ation, he did not &s;o much as hint that he tho't him&s;elf <HI>wrong in the letters,</HI> either for <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>manner,</HI> either in <HI>general</HI> or <HI>particular,</HI> either in <HI>part</HI> or in <HI>whole:</HI> but appeared to ju&s;tify the letters, and every thing relating to them, from beginning to end, as he does now in his book.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brother in his narrative &s;ays, <Q>I do not believe one of the brethren will &s;ay, they heard him &s;peak one word in the whole of their confer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing together, as if he thought he did the lea&s;t ami&s;s in what he had charged Mr. <HI>C.</HI> with in his letters. Upon the &s;tricte&s;t recollection I cannot remember one word from Mr. <HI>R.</HI> that looked that way. It appeared to me, that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> de&s;igned to have it &s;aid, or to have it to &s;ay him&s;elf, that he never did &s;ay any thing of this kind, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he was wrong in writing as he did to Mr. <HI>C.</HI></Q></NOTE> How then could I make up?

The account he has given of the affair is full of gro&s;s errors, tending to mi&s;lead the reader greatly. 1&s;t. He &s;ays, "a number of the brethren met at his hou&s;e, in order to confer, and endeavor to heal the breach." <HI>p.</HI> 71. The brethren did not meet to <HI>confer</HI> and <HI>u&s;e endeavors,</HI> but to &s;et as <HI>mum-chances</HI> to hear us jaw, and contradict. If a free conference had been allowed, it is likely &s;omething might have been brought to pa&s;s. But this was &s;trictly forbid, though two of the brethren on his &s;ide &s;poke &s;everal times, without controul, either from him or me; but when one that went with me once attempted to &s;peak, his mouth was &s;topped immediately before he could bring out one &s;en|tence. (<HI>"You are not to &s;peak one word,"</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to him) The end of my having <HI>brethren</HI> with me was in pur&s;uance of Chri&s;t's rule, <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 16. and I &s;uppo&s;e their bu&s;ine&s;s was, to interpo&s;e when either party carried matters too high, and to me|diate and propo&s;e terms of accommodation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the door was effectually barred again&s;t this.

<PB N="128" REF="012739_0125_0F8BEA590767BC98">upon me and others. If I had accepted the terms, how would he and his party have laughed in their &s;leeves? telling all about, "that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> had confe&s;&s;ed nothing: that after making a great &s;tir, I had given up all for a &s;ong; that being con|&s;cious of my own guilt, I dur&s;t not pro&s;ecute the affair any further, but was glad to come off &s;o, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" And he would have gone on ju&s;tifying his letters and conduct to the end of time. 3. He &s;ays, "the major part of the brethren thought the &s;atisfaction he offered, rea&s;onable and &s;ufficient, and that they &s;hould de&s;ire no more, had they been the offended." <HI>p.</HI> 71. But how could they know <HI>that,</HI> without they heard the <HI>particulars</HI> I had again&s;t him? will they fall under the condemnation of <HI>judging a matter before they hear it?</HI> "but they knew the particulars."

<PB N="129" REF="012739_0126_0F8BEA59B7CD9560">agreement, and invited one more to the meeting than I. Two of which number were as great &s;ticklers in the affair as him&s;elf, and <HI>I</HI> would <HI>rather</HI> have left the whole matter to him alone, than to them. And the 3d in the number was wholly under his influence. And the 4th (who had ne|ver heard my account of the matter) &s;eemed, by what he &s;aid at the meeting, to go upon this prin|ciple, "that as no body thought the <HI>wor&s;e</HI> of me for his letter, it would be be&s;t to pa&s;s it lightly by:" being a man of peace, he would have been glad of peace at any rate.

<P>Again, he &s;ays, "mini&s;ters as well as brethren advi&s;ed to &s;uch a general making up as he propo&s;|ed." He means the mini&s;ters of <HI>Middleborough</HI> coun|cil: I have a&s;ked 3 of them, and they tell me they never gave &s;uch advice. That there was indeed a tran&s;ient expre&s;&s;ion of one of the mini&s;ters pre|&s;ent about burning the letters, and &s;o fini&s;hing the controver&s;y&mdash;and that was all.</P>
<P>Finally, he &s;ays, "that I pulled out 3 or 4 <HI>confe&s;&s;i|ons</HI> for him to make." <HI>p.</HI> 72. This conveys a wrong idea. I made a few <HI>memorandums</HI> in &s;hort hand on the back of his letter, running in the&s;e terms. 1&s;t. As to the charge of <HI>in&s;incerity and deceit.</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;ays in his la&s;t letter, "that it was far from his intenti|on." I expect he will add further, that he di&s;avows all &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as look that way, or carry &s;uch an implication in them, in the apprehen&s;ion of any. 2d. As to the charge of <HI>arminiani&s;m,</HI> I expect he &s;ay thus much at lea&s;t, that he did this without &s;uffi|cient grounds, and that it aro&s;e from mi&s;taken ap|prehen&s;ions of what I read. 3d. That the expre&s;&s;i|ons were uncharitable and improper, wherein he a&s;&s;erts "that the <HI>mo&s;t godly</HI> among us, were all on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion." There were 2, or 3,
<PB N="130" REF="012739_0127_0F8BEA5F24B0F1C0">other articles &s;et down, that did not relate to the letters. But the&s;e were all I read to him. And I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to propo&s;e more moderate terms. But he would &s;carce give me the hearing, and rejected the whole with di&s;dain. As for my refu&s;ing to an&s;wer a que&s;tion. <HI>p.</HI> 72. I think I was quite right in it, unle&s;s he would go into particu|lars, and tell me wherein I had offended. Thus the meeting terminated. And by this account, which is ju&s;t, does it appear, that he was any ways di&s;po&s;ed to peace? The brother, mentioned in his narrative, &s;ays, "I am much &s;urprized Mr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;hould &s;ay <HI>"he endeavored a reconciliation in the pre&s;ence of a number of the brethren."</HI> It appeared to me, and &s;o it did to others pre&s;ent, <Q>that there appeared no di&s;po&s;ition in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to take one proper or chri&s;tian &s;tep for a reconciliation; for no per|&s;on could be more deaf to any propo&s;als made by another, and more fixedly to appearance &s;et|tled in the matter not to hear any thing Mr. <HI>C.</HI> offered, and <HI>often</HI> &s;pake of his own propo&s;al, as if it was going further than was needful, but that he did it for peace &s;ake, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" Again, he &s;ays, there appeared to me from the beginning to the end of their conference, that there was no di&s;|po&s;ition in Mr. <HI>R.</HI> to make up the matter in any &s;hape, unle&s;s he could lay Mr. <HI>C.</HI> under &s;uch a <HI>di&s;advantage</HI> as no <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> ought to <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to.</Q> He &s;ays further, "that captain <HI>C.</HI> deacon <HI>T.</HI> and I (the three brethren pre&s;ent) have divers times &s;ince &s;aid to one another, that it appeared to us, that Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s treatment of Mr. <HI>C.</HI> at that time was rather an <HI>in&s;ulting</HI> of him, than &s;hewing any <HI>real de&s;ire</HI> of &s;ettling the affair in a friendly and chri&s;tian man|ner." And &s;ince that time what hath he done towards reconciliation? he indeed goes about every where crying, "how much he is for peace; that he longs to have the matter &s;ettled, that he is will|ing to do any thing," <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this means his hearers are induced to think, that he is all made up of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>peace:</HI> but let any one touch upon <HI>particulars,</HI> he will ju&s;tify <HI>all</HI> as much as ever, and mi&s;repre&s;entation abound more and more.</NOTE> And yet what <HI>one &s;tep</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="012739_0128_0F8BEA61686ED868">hath he taken towards it? I was indeed a little in hopes, that he would have laid &s;ome foundation for a reconciliation in his book, or made &s;ome con|ce&s;&s;ion, after &s;o long time of deliberation: but in &s;tead of that, he aggravates matters to the utmo&s;t, and hath widened the breach ten-fold more than ever. Which gives a &s;pecimen of what he would have done at this meeting, if we had come to par|ticulars. Who then can blame me for not accept|ing his propo&s;al, or agreeing to his offer of a <HI>gene|ral oblivion?</HI> which is the utmo&s;t that can be &s;aid of it, and really all he intended.</P>
<P>I come now to the article of his "giving me the lye in the face of the church." <HI>p.</HI> 73. I had di&s;a|vowed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn terms any <HI>direct de&s;ign</HI> of getting him away, and declared that our oppo&s;iti|on proceeded <HI>&s;olely</HI> from con&s;ciencious motives. He pre&s;ently &s;tarts up, and tells the church in effect, that he did not believe one word I &s;aid, but that "he was now <HI>confirmed</HI> in it, our whole de&s;ign was to get him away." But what were the grounds of his di&s;belief? or what gave him confirmation? he tells us, "it was a matter much talked of, in the town." I dare &s;ay, it was never talked of, till he and his <HI>two</HI> emi&s;&s;aries infu&s;ed it into people. Not &s;o, &s;ays he, "I &s;uppo&s;e they formed their opinion from the whole tenor of his conduct towards me of late." I challenge him and his whole <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> to allege <HI>one &s;peech</HI> or <HI>overt-act</HI> tending that way, (except my public writings have that tendency.) But what, though it appeared &s;o evident to the whole pari&s;h, that I had a de&s;ign of getting him away; yet he &s;eems &s;till to he&s;itate and doubt about it: how comes he at length "to be better &s;atisfied, that the reports were true?" why, by the <HI>matter</HI> and the <HI>extraordinary manner,</HI> in which my la&s;t piece was delivered?" this gave full proof and "confirmati|on," whatever I could &s;ay to the contrary. But why does he put in the <HI>manner,</HI> except it be to im|po&s;e upon the public? what could there be <HI>extra|ordinary</HI> in that? if it was delivered with "un|chri&s;tian heat," as he intimates, <HI>p.</HI> 75. had that a tendency to get him away? &s;hould I not defeat
<PB N="132" REF="012739_0129_0F8BEA6253CC92B0">my own end by taking &s;uch a method? in truth I had &s;uch a bad cold and cough at that time, and for above 3 months before, that I believe I deli|vered my&s;elf in a <HI>very ordinary manner,</HI> and not with much <HI>pathos.</HI> As for the <HI>matter,</HI> that appears from the print, to be wor&s;e than it was, the church appeared to be in &s;uch <HI>extraordinary agitation</HI> upon the account of a paper clande&s;tinely &s;igned, and brought in (of which more pre&s;ently) that I tho't I would not aggravate matters. And accordingly in reading my E&s;&s;ay, I omitted that paragraph about <HI>infant's being &s;prinkled,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 62. And al&s;o the whole of the 10th and 11th heads, <HI>p.</HI> 70. and the whole of the conclu&s;ion about his expedient, <HI>p.</HI> 73. which &s;eemed to have a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> reference; and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> never &s;aw or heard them, till they appear|ed in print.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was likewi&s;e another article omitted both in the read|ing and in the <HI>printing</HI> too (lea&s;t I &s;hould load him too much, and which unle&s;s remedied, there will be no peace, to this church;) and that relates to a record he made (after the 2 or 3 fir&s;t meetings) which he calls <HI>&s;tating the arguments on both &s;ides,</HI>" and which was made of his own mere motion without the knowledge and con&s;ent of the church. It is among the propo&s;als to|wards the latter end of my la&s;t E&s;&s;ay, and runs in tho&s;e terms. "3d. I would propo&s;e, that the church record relating to this point may be era&s;ed or amended. It is the duty of a <HI>clerk</HI> to record the tran&s;actions of the &s;ociety he belongs to, and not his own fancies and opinions. If the clerk of the general court, or of a town, &s;hould take liberty of &s;tating ca&s;es, reciting arguments, and giving prefer|ence to which &s;ide he plea&s;es, and making it part of the public records, without the knowlege of his con&s;tituents; how would it be re&s;ented? but if a clerk &s;hould go fur|ther &s;till, and draw up &s;uch a &s;tate of the ca&s;e, as evident|ly condemned the court or town, and brought a <HI>&s;lur</HI> upon their <HI>former practices</HI> (upon their own records) what a <HI>&s;tigma</HI> would he bring upon him&s;elf? it is certain, that the account &s;et down on the church records does not contain a full and compleat &s;tate of the arguments on both &s;ides; &s;ome of the arguments are wholly omitted, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;ome things are added, which I never heard at any church-meeting.

<PB N="133" REF="012739_0130_0F8BEA62B702E6A8">except <HI>general matter</HI> left. And how could he from that infer, that I had a de&s;ign of getting him away; yea, and be ab&s;olutely confirmed in it too? but &s;till &s;ays he, "actions &s;peak louder than words;" and from them it was evident, that I had &s;uch a de&s;ign. But what were the&s;e actions? why a &s;eries of wrongs, or "injurious treatment frequently given." <HI>p.</HI> 72. I had &s;aid and done things (to his prejudice) which he could not have thought po&s;&s;ible before," they were &s;o very bad. <HI>p.</HI> 70. "By all that ap|peared of late, it was evident I had LONG &s;ome <HI>root of prejudice</HI> again&s;t him; and that nothing was wanting but opportunity, for it to manife&s;t it&s;elf. But that now opportunity being given by this con|trover&s;y, I had u&s;ed it to purpo&s;e." <HI>p.</HI> 71.

And to the like pur|po&s;e in &s;everal other places.</P>
<P>Thus hath he cloathed me "in a garb of his own manufacture, terrible eno'l acknowledge," and much like the dre&s;s of victims devoted to de&s;truction by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> inqui&s;ition, all painted with devils; yea, and exactly in the &s;ame &s;train and language of a late printed adverti&s;ement. But to &s;trip my&s;elf of this awful garb, let me ob&s;erve a few things. 1&s;t. That at the time of this meeting, our divi&s;ion was comprized in a narrow compa&s;s. It was in a manner, all contained in the letters that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us: he did not &s;o much as hint, that he had any thing further again&s;t me at the meeting with
<PB N="134" REF="012739_0131_0F8BEA639ABD8CF0">the brethren, that followed &s;oon after; no, nor at any other time hath he intimated to me, that he took offence at any thing el&s;e. But now it &s;eems there was a &s;eries of other injuries. How unju&s;t and unchri&s;tian are &s;uch repre&s;entations? as for my letter, the world hath that before them; and they may judge, as well as we, whether it gave founda|tion for all this outcry. 2d. The &s;ugge&s;tion is utter|ly groundle&s;s, "that nothing but <HI>opportunity</HI> was wanting for me to revenge my&s;elf, or to manife&s;t the <HI>rooted prejudice</HI> or grudge I had long bore him." For never man gave more <HI>opportunities,</HI> if I had been di&s;po&s;ed to embrace them. His <HI>imprudent management</HI> was &s;uch from year to year, that the pari&s;h was frequently in a flame about it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At &s;ome of the&s;e times, I my&s;elf heard one of his pre&s;ent <HI>prime pillars</HI> allege in his excu&s;e, "that we mu&s;t con|&s;ider that he was but <HI>a child;</HI> and that when he had more years over his head, he would behave with more pru|dence and caution."</NOTE> But how did I behave at &s;uch times? why, in&s;tead of taking the opportunity, I was either &s;ilent, or endeavored to &s;mooth over his conduct. And even when it was propo&s;ed to print my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, I declined it chief|ly on this ground, le&s;t it &s;hould bring on a <HI>per&s;onal conte&s;t</HI> between me and Mr. <HI>R.</HI> And previous to this, when I have been blamed for not preaching in his ab&s;ence, or for being &s;o loth to preach, I have rather bore the blame than tell my rea&s;ons pub|licly, le&s;t it &s;hould hurt him. And when he &s;ent the provoking letters to the precinct committee about his &s;alary, I, with the re&s;t, endeavored to &s;tifle and &s;uppre&s;s them, becau&s;e I knew how much the precinct would re&s;ent it, if they were commu|nicated (as he de&s;igned they &s;hould be) though for this, many much blamed us. Yea, under all the flights and neglects, or ill-treatment in general, I received from him in former years,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps he will here retort, that this is only a <HI>general charge,</HI> and utterly deny any &s;uch treatment. To pre|vent which, let me &s;ubjoin one in&s;tance among many. When he knew, that <HI>3</HI> quarters of the pari&s;h or more would gladly hear me preach, and (being about to take a journey to <HI>Connecticut</HI>) was earne&s;tly urged by &s;ome of the principal men to invite me to &s;upply the pulpit, and told, that it &s;hould not co&s;t him a farthing; he rather than do it, cho&s;e to ride above <HI>40</HI> miles to get a young preacher, who when he came no body liked, and I was forced at la&s;t to preach part of the time, at the invitation of the deacons and precinct committee. And (&s;trange to tell) though I preached &s;o frequently&punc; he never once heard me till the time of his <HI>great concern</HI> about <HI>4</HI> or <HI>5</HI> years ago, altho' he hath been in the town ever &s;ince the year <HI>1759.</HI> He in|deed never went &s;o far as (he has now) to forbid my preach|ing; he knew that would not bear; however he di&s;couraged it as far as he dur&s;t, all the while declaring to &s;ome that were then clo&s;ely attached to me, "how he <HI>longed</HI> to hear me preach and what a value he had for me, &amp;c." but to others he talked otherways; and to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, told about town, "that the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> advi&s;ed him not to a&s;k me to preach; which I cannot think true, mo&s;t of them freely and repeatedly a&s;king me into their own pulpits. Nay, to &s;uch a height did he carry his di&s;like, that when once he was obliged by his people to invite me to preach upon his being &s;uddenly taken ill, his <HI>wife</HI> went to the other meet|ing, though there was no mini&s;terial communion between him and the other mini&s;ter. This could not proceed from any di&s;ta&s;te to my manner of preaching for &s;he had never heard me. Many other &s;lights there were, be&s;ides tho&s;e on the article of preaching. Let me particularly mention one; when I was cho&s;en <HI>town-clerk</HI> anno 1766, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay after the meeting, in a large and promi&s;cuous company, re&s;pect|ing me and my competitor; "he wondered that they &s;hould cho&s;e Mr. <HI>C.</HI> Mr. <HI>S&mdash;r</HI> would have made a charm|ing clerk." Here ob&s;erve, a <HI>meddling</HI> with town and precinct affairs; which I and others have had ten-fold more <HI>experience</HI> of the la&s;t <HI>March.</HI></NOTE> I bore it with
<PB N="135" REF="012739_0132_0F8BEA6439694BD0">patience, and would not &s;o much as hint any thing to his di&s;advantage. Here, by the way, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that if he had not been <HI>con&s;cious</HI> of ill-treating me in former years, he would not have <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> I bore him an old grudge. I &s;hould &s;ure|ly have been one of the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of mortals to bear re|&s;entment again&s;t any one that never injured me,
<PB N="136" REF="012739_0133_0F8BEA6561A25230">but had always treated me with kindne&s;s and re&s;|pect. I would ob&s;erve further, that after the church-meetings upon this affair had been di&s;con|tinued for about a 12 month, I had no hand in their revival; I knew nothing of the 3 deacon's making the motion, till after it was done; I was not con&s;ult|ed upon it; if I had been, I &s;hould have advi&s;ed again&s;t it: &s;o far was I from pu&s;hing it on, to get him away. It &s;truck me with con&s;ternation when I fir&s;t heard of it, as partly &s;eeing the event. I knew Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s natural di&s;po&s;ition, that he would be <HI>&s;trengthened by oppo&s;ition,</HI> at lea&s;t from &s;uch <HI>minute beings</HI> as he apprehended us to be; whereas by longer forbearance he might fall off from his new notions of his own accord, his native &s;icklene&s;s and in&s;ta|bility giving &s;ome ground of hope. I could &s;ee no other con&s;equence re&s;ulting from a new meeting, but that Mr. <HI>R.</HI> mu&s;t leave us, or the church give up the practice to gratify him: to prevent <HI>either,</HI> I &s;et my&s;elf to &s;tudy for &s;ome expedient, in which both might agree, and at length thought of <HI>a neigh|bouring mini&s;ter</HI>'s <HI>coming;</HI> which I accordingly propo&s;|ed: how Mr. <HI>R.</HI> received it, the world hath heard. And even after he had given <HI>me offence</HI> by his letters, I made another propo&s;al (E&s;&s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 73.) even giving up the point of <HI>qualifications.</HI> But it was not taken the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> notice of. This was the ca&s;e. And yet now one of the&s;e very per&s;ons, that petitioned for the meetings being revived, and was as earne&s;t in it as the re&s;t, <HI>joins</HI> in the cry of a de&s;ign of driving Mr. <HI>R.</HI> off, when I did all I could to prevent it; which I think very hard: when he had laid me under a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of going on with my defence (I could do no other, when the meetings were once revived). That yet he &s;hould tax me for it, and impute it to <HI>bad de&s;igns,</HI> even without once di&s;cour&s;ing with me upon the affair: Is this <HI>brotherly</HI> or <HI>chri&s;tian!</HI> Alas! how far will affection &s;ometimes lead good men! To &s;um up all in a word, if &s;uch prejudice &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in my brea&s;t, as Mr. <HI>R.</HI> here &s;ugge&s;ts, if I retained an old grudge again&s;t him, is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould lye dormant? could I help manife&s;ting it &s;ome way or other, in &s;uch a long cour&s;e of years? and I appeal
<PB N="137" REF="012739_0134_0F8BEA65D7FF5750">to the whole pari&s;h, whether by word or action, I have tried to hurt him. But to pa&s;s on, 3d.

And how ea&s;y is it to a&s;per&s;e the be&s;t man alive in this manner? and who could e&s;cape? if I was guilty of &s;uch acts of injury, and that &s;o frequently, why are they not particu|larized? why does he not tell the world what they are? I challenge him to do it; I demand it of him, as a man, as a chri&s;tian, as a mini&s;ter, that he bring them forth: I will turn the whole cau&s;e upon it, if he can produce &s;o much as one, except he rai&s;es up fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me, or except he accu&s;es me <HI>in the matter of my God,</HI> i. e. for my de|fence of what I think a truth, an important truth of Chri&s;t.

However, if there had been, this does not prove <HI>I gave him the lye:</HI> for I did not thwart or contradict him at that time in the face of the church; nei|ther &s;aying or reading any thing relating to the expedient.</NOTE> And as for what he puts in contra&s;t to this, and which makes the <HI>lye,</HI> namely, my &s;aying, "no church in the province practices any thing like it, and that we could not tell whether the report about the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church was true or no." (<HI>p.</HI> 73. E&s;&s;ays.) This was not read at the church-meeting, as I have ob&s;erved before; no, neither was it &s;o much as wrote; I adding that part, when I tran&s;cribed the E&s;&s;ays for the pre&s;s, upon hearing that after the di&s;&s;olution of the meeting, he &s;till urged the members to come into the expedient. So that <HI>his a&s;&s;ertion</HI> and my <HI>denial</HI> in the face of the church publicly, mu&s;t both fall to the ground; there never was any &s;uch thing on either &s;ide. And as for his telling me of it in pri|vate at my own hou&s;e, I am certain he never did;
<PB N="140" REF="012739_0137_0F8BEA6ED519DB00">we talking only of the propriety of the expedient. I had the account of the practice of the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church from another quarter. And as for the church in this province that is in the practice, I know not what he means; I cannot &s;o much as gue&s;s even now what church he refers to. I have heard &s;ince my E&s;&s;ays were in the pre&s;s, that this expedi|ent was in common u&s;e among the <HI>Connecticut</HI> church|es in Dr. <HI>B</HI>'s &s;cheme. Why did he not tell us of this! had he a mind to appear among us as one of the prime leaders in this new device? and &s;o be hand|ed down to po&s;terity on the li&s;t of fame?</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the re&s;t of his 74th <HI>p.</HI> though it ju&s;tly de&s;erves ca&s;tigation. And proceed to his account of the la&s;t church-meeting, <HI>p.</HI> 75. with which he fini&s;hes his book. I had prepared a particular ac|count of this meeting to be added to my E&s;&s;ays: but fearing to bring di&s;credit on the church (which was my <HI>alma mater</HI>) I era&s;ed it; and only concluded with a general and &s;hort relation, which I thought impo&s;&s;ible any &s;hould be offended at. But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>R.</HI> hath taken great offence. And by his ran|dom and imprudent manner of writing about it, hath nece&s;&s;itated me to be particular in the affair, which I am really &s;orry for. He &s;ays, "I repre&s;ent him, as <HI>un&s;atisfied</HI> with the di&s;&s;olution of the meet|ing" I never gave any &s;uch repre&s;entation, as I have noted before; it was what he wanted. He tells us "the church were not willing to hear me any more, having &s;een the &s;ad effects of my E&s;&s;ays in former meetings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What an idea does this carry with it, as if I had <HI>forced</HI> my E&s;&s;ays upon the church in former meetings, (&s;o that they were wearied out with them) and urged the matter even to nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s? when in fact the church appeared always de&s;irous to hear me till now, and many act|ually put me on to &s;peak. The more their ingrati|tude, that they now give me up a <HI>victim</HI> to Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s re&s;entment! they cannot but know, that <HI>I am &s;uf|fering for pleading their cau&s;e and the cau&s;e of their children:</HI> and why will they not &s;ee me <HI>righted?</HI> how cruel and unbrotherly to leave me thus in the lurch? But why were they not willing to hear me now?
<PB N="141" REF="012739_0138_0F8BEA6F76392638">becau&s;e Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and his &s;econds had told them, "that it was not <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> but <HI>revenge</HI> that influenced us, and that our only motive was to drive him off:" and they had previou&s;ly determined to bar any further proce&s;s, and to di&s;&s;olve the meeting at all events. But what were the <HI>&s;ad effects</HI> of my E&s;&s;ays formerly? why, it prevented his gaining his ends, and getting the practice ca&s;t out, and he had <HI>un|ju&s;tly picked a quarrel</HI> with me for it. He could not brook oppo&s;ition. "I could not have believed it po&s;&s;ible, &s;ays he, &s;ome years ago." <HI>p.</HI> 70. <HI>Believed what?</HI> why, that I &s;hould be &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to ri&s;e in rebellion, and dare to defend a practice, that he had &s;tigmatized. This was the whole that he could object again&s;t me. He tells us further, "that there was more warmth and unchri&s;tian heat in this than in any of our meetings before, and that we <HI>had all rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of it.</HI>" It is well he <HI>takes him&s;elf in;</HI> it is the <HI>fir&s;t time</HI> he hath done it throughout his whole book. But what was "the occa&s;ion of this heat?" why, "our oppo&s;ition to the di&s;&s;olution of the meeting." Here he <HI>&s;kulks</HI> out again, and lays all the blame on us. But was this fact? no; it was not the di&s;&s;olving the meeting (this we would have con&s;ented to on proper terms) but <HI>the paper</HI> that he immediately mentions, which cau&s;ed all this heat and warmth. A paper had been drawn up (not "a day or two," as he &s;ays, but) &s;everal days before the meeting, and put into the hands of a <HI>proper in&s;trument,</HI> who, carrying it about, <HI>ployed his game</HI> &s;o well, as to get near half the church to &s;ign. But "this they did willingly, &s;ays Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and not by con&s;traint or <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion.</HI>" How could this be, when he went to one member no le&s;s than 3 times, <HI>per&s;uading</HI> him to &s;ign, but he finally refu&s;ed? and was not the utmo&s;t art, or rather artifice, u&s;ed with the re&s;t? did he not tell the members applied to, "that this was the only way to keep Mr. <HI>R?</HI> that there was a plan laid to get him away? that this was all we had in view in our oppo&s;ition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" or &s;uch like &s;ugge&s;tions. And was it not &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e, that in|duced them to &s;ign? I appeal to the members &s;ign|ing, whether this was not the ca&s;e. This paper

<P>May God give a happy termination to the&s;e things; may peace as well as truth flouri&s;h in our days; may we all have the temper of the go&s;pel implanted and cultivated in us; and may this church (the fir&s;t in <HI>New-England</HI>) be increa&s;ed with the increa&s;ings of God, and may all the members of it be found walking in the ways of truth and peace, to the Redeemer's glory, the good of others, and rejoicing of their own &s;ouls in the day of Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the fini&s;hing of this an&s;wer, &s;omething has occurred, proper to mention, which per|haps the reader will look upon as a mere tragi-comedy. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> a brother of the church being very unea&s;y at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, of his own mere motion went to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and earne&s;t|ly urged him to come and conver&s;e with me alone, and endeavor to heal the breach between us: this Mr. <HI>R.</HI> utterly refu&s;ed. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> then propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould have another conference with &s;ome of the brethren pre&s;ent, to &s;ee if nothing could be done. This Mr. <HI>R.</HI> conceded to, and gave him leave to propo&s;e it to me; withal &s;igni|fying, that he was &s;en&s;ible he had been to blame in the affair. The propo&s;ition being made to me, after due con&s;ideration, I wrote as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Written to prevent mi&s;takes, and as a help to the memory.</P>
<P>Whereas it has been propo&s;ed, that Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> and I &s;hould have another meeting, with a num|ber of the brethren pre&s;ent, in order to adju&s;t the difference between us; and Mr. <HI>Ribbins</HI> having con&s;ented: being &s;incerely de&s;irous of peace upon proper grounds I al&s;o &s;ignify my con&s;ent thereto upon the&s;e terms. 1&s;t. That previous to &s;aid meet|ing, Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> &s;ignify his <HI>readine&s;s</HI> to acknowledge, <HI>that he hath greatly wronged and injured me by his letters both as to matter and manner.</HI> And that this is a point, that &s;hall not &s;o much as be brought into debate at &s;uch meeting. 2d. That as to all other matters of complaint or grievance on either &s;ide, the particu|lars
<PB N="150" REF="012739_0147_0F909095903CB530">be freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and opened at &s;aid meeting, and an accommodation endeavored. 3d. That there &s;hall be an equal number, of brethren cho&s;en on both &s;ides, and that their mouths &s;hall not be &s;top|ped, as at the former meeting; but that they &s;hall have free liberty to &s;peak, and mediate and inter|po&s;e as they &s;hall &s;ee occa&s;ion. 4th. That if an accomodation be effected the terms &s;hall be reduc|ed to writing, and &s;igned by both parties. 5th. That in order the more effectually to bring about an accommodation, whether it would not be pro|per and advi&s;able to have 2 or 3 neighboring mi|ni&s;ters pre&s;ent? unle&s;s the&s;e terms be agreed to, I am confident it would be to little purpo&s;e to con|fer in any &s;hape. But if Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> concedes to them, I &s;tand ready to meet him at any place that he &s;hall propo&s;e, although I do not think my&s;elf obliged by the laws of chri&s;tianity to take any fur|ther <HI>private &s;teps,</HI> but the affair &s;eems ripe for a public cognizance. But for the &s;ake of peace, I am ready to fall in with any thing that is lawful and rea&s;onable, and that has a tendency to put an end to this uncomfortable affair.&mdash;</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This I wrote to prevent wrong accounts of the affair, (well knowing the <HI>danger</HI> of a <HI>verbal an&s;wer;</HI>) but I wrote not to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> becau&s;e he did not write to me, and becau&s;e my la&s;t letter was &s;ent back with contempt, unread as he &s;ays. <HI>p.</HI> 70. The whole was de&s;igned merely as a memorandum, and to help Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s memory in returning an an&s;wer. This &s;cript being communicated to a number of the brethren and approved by them, I &s;ometime after delivered to Mr. <HI>H.</HI> who upon hearing it read, &s;aid, "he believed (as he gathered from Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s talk) that he would con&s;ent to every particular, except that about mini&s;ter's being pre&s;ent." I then directed him either to read the paper to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> or let him read it him&s;elf, and even take a co|py of it (if he de&s;ired it) but to bring back the ori|ginal. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> accordingly gave him the paper, which having read, he de&s;ired it might be left
<PB N="151" REF="012739_0148_0F90909706A5ACE8">with him for a while, as not having time to take a copy of it then. It &s;eems he was in &s;uch a hurry to communicate it, that he would not take time, as he might well have done; and he could not &s;o well repre&s;ent it as a letter to him if it had not been in my hand-writing. He pre&s;ently repairs to his <HI>grand non-communicant coun&s;ellor</HI> &s;everal times re|ferred to in this piece; and having con&s;ulted with him, he then flies about the town from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and read the paper (after his manner) to tho&s;e of his favorers he met with, communicants or non-communicants, old and young, (with large annotations) &s;pending the remainder of this and mo&s;t of the next day in this exerci&s;e. So that it was late the next day, and after going 2 or 3 times, before Mr. <HI>H.</HI> could get back the original, and even then he appeared loth to part with it. But he re|turned me no an&s;wer by Mr. <HI>H.</HI> either written or verbal, and &s;ignified to him his di&s;like of <HI>the whole paper,</HI> and that he was generally advi&s;ed to take no notice of it, with intimations of my being impla|cable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the mean time, the report flew like lightning every where, and even into neighboring pari&s;hes, "that I had wrote another letter to Mr. <HI>R.</HI> and in it abu&s;ed and <HI>in&s;ulted</HI> him in a high de|gree, and in &s;hort had <HI>done wor&s;e than ever before.</HI>" I could not imagine how this could be; and the paper being returned, one or two of the brethren traced, the reports, having the original in their pockets; and the brethren to whom Mr. <HI>R.</HI> read it, appeared generally highly incen&s;ed again&s;t me for my bad treatment of Mr. <HI>R.</HI> Upon which they read the pa|per to them. Mo&s;t of them &s;eemed amazed, and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>R.</HI> did not read it &s;o to them, and could &s;carce believe it was the &s;ame paper, and &s;ome of them de&s;ired to hear it 2 or 3 times before they could give any credit to it, and mo&s;t of them de|clared, they could &s;ee no harm in the paper as it was read to them now. And &s;ome &s;eemed &s;o unea&s;y, that they &s;aid they would go and di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. <HI>R.</HI> upon it. But how can this be account|ed for? would even one of the wor&s;t of men have dared thus to impo&s;e upon people, when he was
<PB N="152" REF="012739_0149_0F909097B9B32DE0">&s;o liable to detection? I an&s;wer, I &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e to be this; that as he read the paper, he kept paraphra&s;ing as he went along, and keeping his eye upon the paper, they took his comments to be part of the paper: and &s;o were angry or plea&s;ed; ju&s;t as he appeared to be him&s;elf. However, this is not a full &s;olution. It is evident by their &s;everal accounts, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome paragraphs omit|ted in reading: for it was generally under&s;tood. 1&s;t. That I wrote him another letter, and &s;o was going to create a fre&s;h di&s;turbance. 2d. That the motion for another meeting originated from me and not from him. 3d. That I in&s;i&s;ted upon his making a confe&s;&s;ion previous to the meeting, and bringing or &s;ending it to me in writing, or <HI>he &s;hould not &s;ee my face</HI> (as he phra&s;ed it, or read it, as &s;ome &s;ay.) Whereas the contrary to all this appeared plainly from the face of the paper. It was wrote to prevent mi&s;takes, and not directed to him. It is a declared an&s;wer to a propo&s;al of his; and all re|quired was, "that he &s;hould <HI>&s;ignify his readine&s;s</HI>" to make &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion: but the <HI>actual doing</HI> of it was to be part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting. Thus they would have certainly under&s;tood it, if it had been read as it ought to have been. As to the article of <HI>confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> I thought it a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> pre|liminary; for what &s;ignified it to meet, unle&s;s he appeared <HI>di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;omething?</HI> and this was the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> I could accept of; and it was in &s;ome &s;ort a coming to his terms of <HI>a general making up,</HI> which (to u&s;e his phra&s;e) I thought even "a conde&s;cen&s;i|on in me." With re&s;pect to the &s;econd article, he &s;aid, that his hands were to be tyed, but I was to be le&s;t open and loo&s;e: Whereas I had &s;everal ma|terial articles again&s;t him, be&s;ides that of the let|ters, which were left as much at a loo&s;e. The 3d. article he read with an <HI>empha&s;is,</HI> and it was made criminal in an high degree. There was nothing but <HI>&s;hall, &s;hall, &s;hall.</HI> In &s;hort, I appeared as arbi|trary and ab&s;olute as the great <HI>Turk:</HI> it was no|thing but SHALL and WILL with me. So that I SHALL be almo&s;t afraid even to &s;peak in the future ten&s;e again, at lea&s;t in addre&s;&s;ing Mr. <HI>R.</HI> There
<PB N="153" REF="012739_0150_0F90909876AF3CB0">was another de&s;potical or dogmatic SHALL under the 4th head. As to the 5th, I was for bringing a council upon him at once, and it &s;eems the words "proper and advi&s;able," and it's being propo&s;ed by way of query, were &s;unk in the reading. For the hearers took it, that there was another SHALL here too. And to crown all, he denied that it was he who &s;top<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the brethren's mouth at the form|er meeting, and &s;aid, "it was my own propo&s;al." (Article 3d.) My PROPOSAL! where are we now? into what a world have we got? I &s;hould as &s;oon have expected, that he would have denied that we ever had any meeting at all: however I am glad it is come out before my an&s;wer went to the pre&s;s. My PROPOSAL! the deacon who interpo&s;ed between us, and the only witne&s;s in the ca&s;e, will give his oath to the contrary. And his manage|ment at the meeting (which I have recited) proves that the re&s;triction came from him, and not from me. But it &s;eems he is a&s;hamed of it, and is going to father it upon me; when as I ever abhorred it, being unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf, tending to defeat the whole de&s;ign of the meeting, and repugnant to the example of all chri&s;tians in the like ca&s;es: (I dare &s;ay no in&s;tance of this nature can be found in the annals of the church. Mr. <HI>R.</HI> mu&s;t have the &s;ole honor of the invention.) It was nothing but ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity, and my great de&s;ire of peace, that brought me to &s;ubmit to it. A meeting was to be had upon no other terms But did he not offer other terms? and did not my refu&s;al nece&s;&s;itate him to in|&s;i&s;t on this? he indeed offered not to lay this re|&s;triction, if I would have excluded one brother from the meeting. But this I could not con&s;ent to: it was as nece&s;&s;ary that brother &s;hould be pre&s;ent as I my&s;elf. Not only as an evidence, but as a par|ty offended; he looking upon him&s;elf as equally involved in the charge of <HI>arminiani&s;m</HI> and danger|ous doctrine; and there could be no thoro' making up without him. As to the conclu&s;ion of my pa|per, that expre&s;&s;ion was very offen&s;ive, "the affair &s;eems ripe for a public cognizance." Here it &s;eems
<PB N="154" REF="012739_0151_0F9090995E78B090">I threatned him with a council. But withal &s;ig|nified, that he would not join or take notice of a council. He then thanks his mountain &s;o &s;trong, that it connot be moved; and is re&s;olved to brave it out again&s;t all the world, as long as he can keep the majority of the pari&s;h on his &s;ide. But is this a chri&s;tian di&s;po&s;ition? is it not <HI>his</HI> (as well as <HI>my</HI>) duty to u&s;e all proper means of reconciliation? and is not the advice of mini&s;ters and churches one <HI>in&s;ti|tuted means</HI> for that end? and will he reject all? and make numbers his &s;ole refuge? Alas! what one &s;ingle &s;tep hath he ever yet taken for peace, &s;ince this controver&s;y begun? and he &s;eems now to declare, that he never de&s;igns to take any, but to leave me to my fate! (which &s;ort of manage|ment &s;eems to give full confirmation to a report long prevalent among us, namely, his &s;aying, <HI>that if we had not got deacon</HI> T. <HI>with us, he &s;hould ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e nothing about it</HI>) And his principal adherents join in the &s;ame declaration, of taking no notice of my efforts. The&s;e are the chief things, that have tran&s;pired re&s;pecting this paper. His friends &s;eem cautious of &s;peaking, otherwi&s;e no doubt we &s;hould have ga|thered up many more. One thing indeed I have heard further, that he gives out "Mr. <HI>H.</HI> went beyond his commi&s;&s;ion;" whether in making the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ition in his name, or in &s;ignifying his con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being to blame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or in both, I can|not &s;ay. Thus propo&s;als of peace from me are turn|ed into crimes: if I do, or not do, &s;peak, write, or &s;it &s;till, people will be more and more angry at me. If I had taken no notice of the propo&s;al at all, I &s;hould have been repre&s;ented as implacable, and bad to the la&s;t degree, as refu&s;ing all overtures of peace: and if I do take notice of it in the mo&s;t mode&s;t and chri&s;tian manner, it is looked upon as criminal. What &s;hall I then do? and what will be the end of the&s;e things!</P>
