<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for any hone&s;t man to contemplate the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of publick affairs in this &s;tate without being &s;incerely affected at the &s;cene. The baneful influence of an intere&s;ted and de&s;igning faction enters &s;o deeply into many of our mea&s;ures that in&s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be awak|ened with the con&s;equences. Hardly warm in the &s;eat we already feel our&s;elves goaded with many of the vices and infirmities of the olde&s;t governments. To what infatuation or fatality this has fallen to be our lot it has become the duty, as it is evidently the intere&s;t, of every good citizen to inquire. In &s;uch a re&s;earch philo&s;ophy and the deepe&s;t political &s;kill, acting by &s;cientifick rules at a di&s;tance, would con|fe&s;s them&s;elves at a lo&s;s; for as (according to Black|&s;tone) democracies contain more the principles of publick virtue and goodne&s;s of intention than other forms of government, we ought, by the rules of theory, in our infant &s;tate at lea&s;t, to be free&s;t from the evils now complained of; and this makes it ob|vious it is not in the nature of the &s;y&s;tem, (that hav|ing confe&s;&s;edly the preference to all others) but in the venality and corruption of &s;ome individuals a|mong us, that the di&s;temper lies.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="018430_0003_0FA76BA082409578">
For &s;ome years pa&s;t it has been the unfortunate doom of Georgia, more perhaps than any other &s;tate, to be &s;plit into factions. After having undergone a variety of mutations, the&s;e differences have at length terminated in two parties, who&s;e preponderance will ju&s;t depend upon the prevalence of right or wrong. On the one hand we behold a mo&s;t powerful combi|nation of individuals zealou&s;ly embarked in the &s;cheme of advancing their private fortunes on the ruins of every thing that is dear and valuable to the community. On the other we ob&s;erve a more virtu|ous, though a le&s;s active &s;et of citizens, oppo&s;ing &s;uch views, and counteracting knavery and vocifera|tion with rea&s;on and argument. It is an old remark, that the wicked are infinitely more keen in the pur|&s;uit of bad actions than the good in oppo&s;ing them. The former cla&s;s having plunged them&s;elves into an aby&s;s of debt, now conceive, on the very principles of Catiline, that nothing le&s;s than an internal revolu|tion can extricate them. To this diabolical end are all their mea&s;ures indubitably directed, the mo&s;t in|jurious fal&s;ehoods are di&s;&s;eminated, and whatever &s;eems be&s;t calculated to create di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y again&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes offer a &s;ecurity for con|fidence, and who&s;e private characters command re|&s;pect and e&s;teem, is mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated. To be a man of either reputed hone&s;ty or unembar|ra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances is at once to be at enmity with this confederacy of citizens. Governed them&s;elves by no con&s;iderations but tho&s;e of lucre, they, with an effrontery peculiar to the wicked, concluded all other men acted on the &s;ame principles; they were bold enough to &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;imilarity of intere&s;t would at all times in&s;pire a &s;imilarity of &s;entiment: But how egregiou&s;ly have they been deceived, when they now find that every man of honour, virtue, or property, has withdrawn from them, and they &s;tand the &s;ole champion of their own di&s;graceful under|taking.</P>
<P>It has been for a long time artfully in&s;inuated that
<PB N="3" REF="018430_0004_0FA76BA5C0280230">the di&s;putes in this &s;tate lay between the purcha&s;ers of confi&s;cated property and tho&s;e who did not pur|cha&s;e: But in truth the conte&s;t lies between tho&s;e who have purcha&s;ed without any intention or means of paying <HI>and others of the &s;ame complexion,</HI> and tho&s;e who may or may not have purcha&s;ed, but who ne|verthele&s;s mean the thing that is ju&s;t and right to|wards the publick. It is notorious that &s;ome very con&s;iderable purcha&s;ers are always to be found voting and acting on the &s;ide that evidently con&s;ult common good without any view to their private emolument. It is equally notorious that &s;uch gentlemen have in general paid up their bonds as far as the law allowed <HI>in certificates,</HI> and that they are able and willing to pay the remainder when it &s;hall become due. Some of them indeed <HI>may</HI> contend for the rea&s;onablene&s;s and ju&s;tice of being allowed to pay the <HI>whole</HI> in cer|tificates, by way of di&s;count, if they can procure li|quidated demands again&s;t the publick for that pur|po&s;e: And I confe&s;s there are &s;trong rea&s;ons in fav|our of &s;uch a mode being adopted <HI>now,</HI> which could not be allowed to operate at the time the law pa&s;&s;ed, making a di&s;tinction between certificates and &s;pecie. At that period the Legi&s;lature had not a preci&s;e knowledge of the demands again&s;t the publick, and therefore could not judge whether the means in hand were adequate to the end of a full payment, or whe|ther it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;ort of compo|&s;ition and pay by in&s;tallments: But when it came to be a&s;certained that the amount &s;ales of our confi&s;cat|ed property, with the aids already provided, would be &s;ufficient to &s;ink all the debts of the &s;tate, and leave a very con&s;iderable balance behind, every rea|&s;on for a di&s;crimination cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. But, even were &s;uch a di&s;crimination to continue, it could not affect the hone&s;t and &s;olvent purcha&s;er; for, as the fund is di&s;covered by compari&s;on to be better than was apprehended, in the &s;ame proportion mu&s;t the certificates or draughts upon it appreciate. Be&s;ides it is well known that any man holding a certificate,
<PB N="4" REF="018430_0005_0FA76BA7E06FE0F8">ever and above what he was allowed to pay upon his bond, might, with very little trouble and at no co&s;t, make the &s;ame in every re&s;pect equal to &s;pecie, by throwing it into a particular fund of the &s;tate. In regard to officers demands, there never was, and indeed never can be, any objection again&s;t con&s;ider|ing them as &s;pecie; whenever they come to be pro|perly liquidated and certified, they will an&s;wer as well, by the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, in payments from this &s;tate to the Continent, as gold or &s;ilver: It is true the time limited by act of A&s;&s;embly for bringing them in has elap&s;ed, but I think there is hardly a doubt a longer indulgence will be granted when the Legi&s;lature meet.</P>
<P>Having drawn a line of di&s;tinction between the purcha&s;ers of confi&s;cated property, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that, in a general way, the men who make mo&s;t noi&s;e and pother again&s;t the law, becau&s;e it does not allow them to pay the <HI>whole</HI> of their bonds in certificates, are tho&s;e who have not paid the <HI>half</HI> they might have done in that way, although the time al|lowed for &s;uch purpo&s;e has run out. Men of &s;o &s;candalous a conduct are little better than pe&s;ts to &s;ociety; their motions ought to be narrowly watched, for it is demon&s;trable that, whatever may be the o&s;|ten&s;ible plea or pretence, ambition, avarice, and dark de&s;ign, lurk at the bottom, and give a certain &s;u&s;picious ca&s;t to all their proceedings.</P>
<P>The two principal heroes of this confederacy are &s;aid to be men remarkably well a&s;&s;ociated&mdash;the one in the full and indi&s;puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kind of &s;ubtle midnight cunning which formed a Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;cheme, or a South Sea bubble, more the re&s;ult of a bad heart, and a plodding temper, than the charac|teri&s;tick of genius&mdash;is never &s;o guarded as when he pretends mo&s;t to vaunt him&s;elf upon his candour;&mdash; the other, ver&s;ed in all the little tricks of life, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through the different gradations from the lowe&s;t mechanick to the highe&s;t law officer, finds it as ea&s;y to explain away a forgery as to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate a
<PB N="5" REF="018430_0006_0FA76BA958196B18">character. The former of the&s;e feels no qualms of con&s;cience in atte&s;ting, and thereby procuring to be audited, an account again&s;t the publick for a con&s;i|derable crop which he neither planted or reaped, and was only in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of during the time Count d'E&s;taing lay before the lines of Savannah: The latter with amazing facility can extract a legacy from the dead which the living never thought of, and, by the magick of law language, in order to elude an act of A&s;&s;embly highly favoured by him in every other re|&s;pect, clearly evince, that, "if A. bequeaths a le|gacy to B. his next heir and neare&s;t of kin, if B. af|terwards takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the property, and be|comes attainted and bani&s;hed, that in that ca&s;e B. <HI>being dead in law,</HI> &s;hall be con&s;idered <HI>as having never lived,</HI> and the legacy being lap&s;ed &s;hall fall to the next of kin, who has married a friend to the Revolu|tion;" and of which la&s;t circum&s;tance who is &s;o fit a judge as the expounder of the laws? Under &s;o <HI>just</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> a <HI>law ca&s;e</HI> as this, it is no &s;ecret that fifty-three very valuable &s;laves have pa&s;&s;ed from the funds of the &s;tate to the plantation and pocket of the C&mdash;J&mdash;. Whether at a future day, when this bu&s;ine&s;s comes to be inquired into, the 13th &s;ection of the Confi&s;cation Act, which declares &s;uch em|bezzlements and conver&s;ions to be felony, may not have &s;ome operation, is not for me to determine.</P>
<P>This redoubtable duumvirate lately, under the &s;ignature of Brutus, (two in one, like man and wife) made a mo&s;t angry attack upon the conduct of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration. They had read, or been told, this was the u&s;ual mode of introduction with the young orators of Rome; but the &s;everal grounds upon which they rai&s;ed their battery having failed them, the only product of their labours has been an addition to the infamy of their characters. In re&s;pect to tho&s;e again&s;t whom the envenomed &s;hafts were pointed, they, as became the dignity of their &s;tations, and the fortitude of mind in&s;eparably attached to an upright demeanour, treated their adver&s;aries with &s;ilent
<PB N="6" REF="018430_0007_0FA76BA9B00E17F0">contempt; they had wi&s;ely implanted in their brea&s;ts, and now called in to their aid, the maxim of Lord Bacon, that "to &s;uffer &s;candal is a tax which every per&s;on of rank pays to the publick, and the man who has no virtue in him&s;elf ever envies virtue in others."</P>
<P>We are now upon the eve of a new election of officers; it is therefore a more than ordinary duty, for every man who has a vote to give, to make him|&s;elf well acquainted with characters. The principle of jealou&s;y being the &s;oul of liberty, when properly under&s;tood and liberally applied, is ju&s;t and right; but, if we permit this laudable jealou&s;y to become &s;ynonimous with mean &s;u&s;picion, we &s;hall do our&s;elves a material injury. Can we expect any man of honour or &s;pirit will &s;erve us, when he is certain, that, to accept an office in the &s;tate is to begin his journey on the high road of cen&s;ure and abu&s;e? The perpe|tual clamours and impeachments in Athens, again&s;t the be&s;t citizens of the commonwealth, at length produced a general backwardne&s;s among good men to engage in publick affairs, and left the way open for the ambitious and the de&s;igning. And we read, in the Hi&s;tory of Syracu&s;e, that, when the Petali&s;m was erected there, in imitation of the O&s;traci&s;m at Athens, (and perhaps not unlike the <HI>Toryi&s;m</HI> of Brutus and his junto in Georgia) it was &s;o notoriou&s;ly levelled again&s;t all who had fortune or merit to recommend them, that whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>either</HI> withdrew from the city, and would have no concern in the admini&s;tration of government; &s;o that the people them&s;elves were forced to abrogate it for fear of bringing all things into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In every free &s;tate the evil to be avoided is tyranny. That all government originates with the people is an axiom as uncontrovertible as nece&s;&s;ary to liberty, but that the people them&s;elves <HI>at large</HI> ought not to admini&s;ter that government, further than by a dele|gation of power to their repre&s;entatives and officers, is al&s;o an essential point in the charter of freedom. The <HI>dominatio plebis,</HI> or the dominion of the mob, is
<PB N="7" REF="018430_0008_0FA76BAA7AA77508">the wor&s;t of all governments. In holy writ we find the raging of the &s;ea and the madne&s;s of the people are cla&s;&s;ed together, and it is God alone who can &s;ay to either, hitherto &s;halt thou pa&s;s and no further. Mo&s;t of the convul&s;ions of government in Greece and Rome began with the tyranny of the people, but they generally concluded in that of a &s;ingle per&s;on. The le&s;&s;on I wi&s;h to inculcate from this is, that, although the ma&s;s of the people is the body wherein naturally and originally re&s;ides that ab&s;olute and un|limited power, which in every government is nece&s;|&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omewhere, yet the only u&s;e a wi&s;e people will make of &s;uch power is, at certain &s;tated periods, to elect or appoint fit per&s;ons for their rulers; after &s;uch appointment, to inve&s;t them with a confidence equal to the tru&s;t they are charged with; to protect them again&s;t the tongue of &s;lander, and the arts of de&s;igning men, <HI>when they do right;</HI> and to puni&s;h them, in a regular and con&s;titutional way, <HI>if they do wrong.</HI> When this comes uniformly to be our rule and maxim, we &s;hall be a happy and a flou|ri&s;hing people; till then we may lay our account to be the dupes of every factious demagogue who wants a &s;tep ladder to climb into con&s;equence, or feels a lu&s;t of being richer than his neighbour.</P>
<P>The great article of arranging our finances has been but little attended to in this &s;tate; it is chiefly, though not altogether, owing to this, that our po|litical, as well as commercial importance, are &s;o far behind hand in compari&s;on with &s;ome other &s;tates. There cannot exi&s;t a doubt but that we po&s;&s;e&s;s a country which, for fertility of foil, conveniency of water carriage, and every agrarian or other advant|age whatever, yields to none on the continent: But yet, to all the&s;e bounties of nature it is nece&s;&s;ary that we add the refinements of art, and, by a due culti|vation of the moral, learn rationally to enjoy the phy&s;ical ble&s;&s;ings of life. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that money is not more the &s;inews of war than the pillars of peace, and if we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be &s;e|duced
<PB N="8" REF="018430_0009_0FA76BAB17939560">into an idea that any modern government can maintain its dignity and &s;afety, or di&s;charge its or|dinary functions, without taxes, we &s;hall find our|&s;elves woefully deceived, and ere long di&s;cover our mi&s;take and our puni&s;hment together. We have a large &s;um as our quota of the &s;everal requi&s;itions and debts to pay to Congre&s;s. This money mu&s;t be rai&s;ed, and an act of A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed on the 29th July, 1783, has declared it &s;hall be rai&s;ed, and paid out of the confi&s;cated property. But what pro&s;pect is there of this, whil&s;t, on the one hand, it is part of a &s;y&s;tem with &s;ome not to pay without being &s;ued, and, on the other, we have for our C&mdash; J&mdash; a man who is him&s;elf among the deepe&s;t in the pub|lick books? This &s;ingle con&s;ideration furni&s;hes the be&s;t an&s;wer that could be given to the &s;ixth pre&s;ent|ment of the Grand Jury of Chatham county, and is partly the cau&s;e and partly the effect of the evils complained of in the &s;eventh. Our Con&s;titution, and all the laws pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Revolution, in re|&s;pect to the Judiciary Department, have had for their object a cheap and a &s;peedy cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; but how clearly is <HI>law</HI> convicted of being a <HI>mere dead let|ter,</HI> when we &s;ee a bill of co&s;ts, for two or three trifling motions and arguments about an admini&s;tra|tion, taxed at 22<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;terling, and are told that &s;uits, e&s;pecially where the poor publick is plain|tiff, &s;eldom come to an i&s;&s;ue under two years after their commencement. I have heard of an eminent lawyer who boa&s;ted he would defy any Parliament to make a law that he could not drive a coach and &s;ix through. It is very po&s;&s;ible <HI>our Lord Coke</HI> may not be able to gild the pill &s;o well as that lawyer; but I will venture to an&s;wer for him, that, if he cannot leap the fence, he will break it down in pur&s;uit of his prey. Can any words be &s;tronger or plainer than the&s;e: "All the co&s;ts attending any action in the Superior Court &s;hall not exceed the &s;um of three pounds, and that no cau&s;e be allowed to depend in the Superior Court longer than two terms?" 48th

<P>Here we &s;ee there is not only an error in the ag|gregate &s;um, but al&s;o that the <HI>proportion</HI> of its parts is entirely inverted; for whereas the Con&s;titution and the law intended that the Attorney &s;hould be allowed mo&s;t, as having the greate&s;t &s;hare of trouble, and that the Chief Ju&s;tice and the Clerk &s;hould be upon a footing, in this bill we find the Chief Ju&s;tice has taken the lead, and taxed nearly as much for him&s;elf as for the other two put together. It was thought a very great point in England gained by the people, when, after the Revolution, the Judges were made partly independent of the Crown; the completion of that independence has been almo&s;t the only popular thing afforded to Britain in the reign of George the Third. Would to God <HI>our</HI> Judges were more independent of their intere&s;t than they are, and that the laws would act in uni&s;on with the petition taught by our Saviour, <HI>Lead us not into temptation.</HI></P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that a hearing in re|gard to an admini&s;tration is not in nature of a &s;uit, and therefore does not come within the words of the Con&s;titution; if &s;o, I &s;hall an&s;wer, 1&s;tly, That it is
<PB N="10" REF="018430_0011_0FA76BAC866AE9F0">evident this hearing was con&s;idered, in the eye of the law, infinitely <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> both in point of expence and con|&s;equence, than a regular &s;uit, for the la&s;t clau&s;e but two of the Superior Court Act allows either party to appeal therefrom to a jury, in manner pointed out by the 40th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution; and the whole co&s;ts upon this &s;econd trial, with all the for|mality of proce&s;s, and &s;o forth, were not to exceed 3<ABBR>l.</ABBR> but, 2dly, there is no nece&s;&s;ity to confine our&s;elves to one bill of co&s;ts, when there is &s;o great a choice; there are fifty ready to be produced, wherein the co&s;ts, on a trial by proce&s;s and jury, in the u&s;ual way, are taxed at upwards of twenty pounds. I need not in&s;tance them, becau&s;e they are known to every body, and felt by a great many. My rea&s;on for &s;electing this ca&s;e of the admini&s;tration was, becau&s;e it had been taken up by a Grand Jury, and al&s;o becau&s;e there are other circum&s;tances of aggravation in it be|&s;ides the exorbitancy of the fees. I am well informed, that, after the hearing was had, the C&mdash; J&mdash; ar|bitrarily &s;truck out the name of one of the defendants, and in&s;erted in its room the name of the Attorney who had appeared in the cau&s;e, a gentleman who had never laid claim to any part of the &s;ubject in di&s;pute, and who had left the &s;tate on publick bu&s;ine&s;s at the time this happened. I am al&s;o well informed, that only one of the defendants was taken into cu&s;tody on the attachment of contempt, and he illegally detain|ed by order of the C&mdash; J&mdash; until he had paid the fees of all. I &s;hall, after a few remarks, leave it to the lawyers (as perhaps they may have an opportunity at &s;ome future day) to determine how far an attach|ment of contempt was a legal proce&s;s in this ca&s;e; if it was, then there is nothing but the crime of ex|tortion, with the oppre&s;&s;ive conduct before mention|ed, to be imputed to the C&mdash; J&mdash;; if it was not, then either a gro&s;s ignorance or palpable violation of the law mu&s;t make an additional charge again&s;t him. It would be a great misfortune to a country if a Judge &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf as a <HI>planet in oppo&s;ition</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="018430_0012_0FA76BAD46072AC8">to the Con&s;titution, in&s;omuch as that &s;trictly to be influenced by the latter &s;hould be deemed a con|tempt to him: However, waving all apprehen&s;ions of this &s;ort, I venture to pronounce, that a writ of contempt, in the ca&s;e alluded to, was ju&s;t as regular as it would be for the co&s;ts upon a verdict or non&s;uit in any other ca&s;e. I know very well that Attornies, or other officers of the Court, and even parties them&s;elves, are &s;ometimes liable to the&s;e kinds of writs for di&s;obedience to a rule or order made <HI>in the progre&s;s</HI> of a cau&s;e, or by non-payment of co&s;ts a|warded by the Court upon a motion or the like; but the&s;e are always upon matters ari&s;ing <HI>in the cour&s;e of a &s;uit,</HI> and not at all attached to or connected with its i&s;&s;ue, which determines who &s;hall pay the co&s;ts, and gives a remedy for them. Be&s;ides, the&s;e writs are always awarded <HI>in Court,</HI> for a contempt <HI>to Court,</HI> and not at <HI>Chambers,</HI> where the power of Judges is much circum&s;cribed in compari&s;on to their <HI>curial</HI> &s;itu|ation. I mu&s;t here take occa&s;ion to mention, that I ob&s;erve mo&s;t of the modern rules are dated from Chambers. Surely a Judge mu&s;t be &s;trangely igno|rant of law who &s;uppo&s;es an order made in his own hou&s;e in vacation time can carry the &s;ame weight and authority that a rule made in open Court, with all the &s;olemnity of a by-law, does: But, as an emin|ent writer ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, it is a &s;ingular happine&s;s to mankind that Providence &s;eldom be&s;tows great talents on wicked men; the ignorance of the head is oftentimes a u&s;eful clog upon the depravity of the heart.</P>
<P>Let us however act the fair part, and hear the J&mdash;e in vindication of him&s;elf. <HI>I cau&s;ed full fees to be paid, in order to prevent delays and trifling in future.</HI> The term <HI>full</HI> we are, I pre&s;ume, to under&s;tand in contra di&s;tinction to <HI>legal;</HI> for it would be charging his H&mdash;r with an ab&s;urdity to take them both in one &s;en&s;e. There are evidently two things implied: 1&s;t, a difference between what the party did pay as a tax for his trifling and delay, and what he might only
<PB N="12" REF="018430_0013_0FA76BAE06522A00">have paid if he had not offended the J&mdash;e; and, 2dly, a di&s;cretion in the J&mdash;e to make that difference. Now, it is extremely clear that the Con&s;titution hav|ing determined the party &s;hould pay 3<ABBR>l.</ABBR> as the <HI>legal</HI> fees for trying his cau&s;e, the di&s;cretion of the J&mdash;e ro&s;e upon that, and determined he &s;hould pay 19<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> more, as the <HI>full</HI> fees for trifling with his H&mdash;r's precious time. It was &s;urely merciful to &s;top where he did, for, as the Gauls told the Romans, <HI>Vae victis!</HI> in the hands of &s;uch judicial omnipotence. In fact this excu&s;e is little better than that of a high|way man, who &s;hould pretend he robbed a traveller of his pur&s;e of gold, in order to teach him more wit than to have carried it about him.</P>
<P>The vindication publi&s;hed in the new&s;paper al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, that the bill in que&s;tion was taxed agreeably to act of A&s;&s;embly. If by it be meant the act pa&s;&s;ed in February la&s;t, for the regulation of officers fees, I a&s;&s;ert that &s;everal of the charges are not warranted by that law; but, even were they, a Judge ought to know (and upon any other occa&s;ion this gentleman would have told us) a law directly in the teeth and again&s;t the expre&s;s words of the Con&s;titution is void. We &s;eem, however, to live under a mo&s;t <HI>pliable</HI> Con&s;titution; like Lord Peter's wine-mutton-brown-loaf in Swift's Tale of a Tub, it is one thing, it is another thing, it is any thing or nothing, as &s;uits conveniency, or promotes intere&s;t. One day we are informed, that, let a judgment be obtained when it will in the cour&s;e of the year, yet, that, by the 47th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, no execution can i&s;&s;ue to levy for the money till the fir&s;t Monday in March following; the next day we find this rule relaxed, and a judgment obtained, and an e&s;tate &s;old in the cour&s;e of a &s;ummer. Again, we read in the &s;econd article of the Con&s;titution, "And the Repre&s;entatives &s;o elected &s;hall meet the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in January fol|lowing, at Savannah, or any other place or places where the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly for the time being &s;hall direct;" but are told in a Chief Ju&s;tice's Charge, that,
<PB N="13" REF="018430_0014_0FA76BAF25F32DF0">by the&s;e words, we are not to under&s;tand that the fir&s;t meeting after the election of a new Hou&s;e is to be in Savannah, but in Augu&s;ta, and for this rea&s;on, that the preceding Hou&s;e <HI>intended</HI> to meet at the latter place in July la&s;t. It would have been but candid to mention al&s;o, that &s;uch of the Members (18 in num|ber) as did meet in Augu&s;ta in July pre&s;ented a paper (now to be &s;een of record in the Journals of A&s;&s;embly) to the Executive Authority, recommending that the Hou&s;e &s;hould be called to meet thereafter at &s;uch time and <HI>place</HI> as the Governor and Council &s;hould deem proper; and that, in con&s;equence thereof, on the pre&s;&s;ure of publick bu&s;ine&s;s, the Hou&s;e were called, by proclamation, to meet in Savannah, on the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day in October; but that &s;ummons, like the adjournment, al&s;o failing of its end, left Savannah, and not Augu&s;ta, as the la&s;t place menti|oned in the Journals of the State for the intended meeting of the Legi&s;lature. I mu&s;t make a &s;mall di|gre&s;&s;ion from the incon&s;i&s;tencies of the C&mdash;f, whil&s;t I take a nearer view of this &s;o much talked of que&s;tion, viz. the proper place for the next meeting of the A&s;&s;embly; but I promi&s;e to return to the &s;ubject a|gain as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: To me it is of all things the mo&s;t unaccountable, how any man, who has read the Con&s;titution, and taken an oath to &s;upport it, can a&s;&s;ent to the con&s;truction which the C&mdash; J&mdash; con|tends for. Without doubt there is the &s;ame rea&s;on why the Executive Authority &s;hould have the power of altering the <HI>place,</HI> as of &s;hortening the <HI>period,</HI> of adjournment; and the 20th &s;ection of the Con&s;titu|tion &s;eems clearly to imply &s;o: The Governor and Council are to &s;horten the time of adjournment <HI>upon any emergency:</HI> Surely they may alter the place <HI>upon any unfore&s;een ca&s;ualty,</HI> &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as the town falling into the hands of an enemy; the plague, or even the &s;mallpox, breaking out in it, or the like. But if the&s;e arguments have any weight, when ap|plied to the Hou&s;e who actually made the adjourn|ment, how much more forcible are they when ap|plied
<PB N="14" REF="018430_0015_0FA76BB0C9E399D8">to a new Hou&s;e, who cannot be &s;aid to be in <HI>being</HI> until they meet, qualify, and take their &s;eats in Savannah? It is ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e a former Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly can bind a &s;ucceeding one, by a <HI>mere order,</HI> calculated for, and confined altogether to it|&s;elf; indeed &s;uch an opinion is not only contrary to the 3d &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, which declares e|very A&s;&s;embly &s;hall politically peri&s;h on the day pre|ceding the new election; and to the 7th, which de|clares each Hou&s;e &s;hall &s;ettle its own rules of pro|ceeding; but is al&s;o flatly contradicted by the prac|tice of every new Hou&s;e in drawing up rules for it|&s;elf before the Members go upon bu&s;ine&s;s. Now, &s;urely, if the&s;e rules do not &s;urvive the body which made them, the re&s;olve of adjournment, which is no more than a rule of the Hou&s;e, cannot in the nature of things; be&s;ides, it is not unworthy of remark, that the Legi&s;lature, when they adjourned on 26th February la&s;t, did not then, or at any time previous thereto in the cour&s;e of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, (as they had &s;ometimes before done) re&s;olve that the <HI>next</HI> meeting of A&s;&s;embly (whenever that might happen) &s;hould be in Augu&s;ta, but concluded with the&s;e words, "The Hou&s;e then adjourned, to meet at Augu&s;ta the fir&s;t Monday in July next."</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly may be con&s;idered as executing the <HI>will</HI> of the Convention; but why the Hou&s;e of 1784 &s;hould al&s;o have the power of making a will before their death, and appointing the Hou&s;e of 1785 the mere executors thereof, is what I cannot comprehend. It was evidently the intention of the framers of our Con&s;titution, that, although, in the cour&s;e of the year, the Legi&s;lature might &s;hift about from place to place, to &s;uit the conveniency of all parts of the &s;tate, yet that, at the beginning of every new Hou&s;e, they &s;hould take their departure and &s;et out from one fixed meridian to wit, that of Savannah: And this was certainly acting in conformity to the &s;enti|ments of the able&s;t writers, who hold that all free &s;tates require that their government &s;hould be brought
<PB N="15" REF="018430_0016_0FA76BB106E866F0">back to its true and original principles every now and then; upon which very foundation our annual elec|tions, and the other periodical changes provided for, are grounded: But I have dwelt too long upon &s;o plain a ca&s;e, and will now return to my &s;trictures u|pon &s;ome other parts of the C&mdash;'s conduct.</P>
<P>To form the character of a great Judge there ought to be a happy commixture of the amiable with the admirable qualities. Although the attainment of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in either of the&s;e de&s;criptions may be be|yond the reach of ordinary men, yet one would think caution and pride, the u&s;ual companions of little &s;ouls, would guard again&s;t &s;uch glaring incon&s;i&s;ten|cies as the following: "Many cogent rea&s;ons con|curred to induce me to &s;ugge&s;t to the Grand Juries in the counties through which I have already rode the expediency of revi&s;ing our Con&s;titution: As I &s;peak to men of intelligence it is &s;ufficient only to mention it&mdash;if with harmony and temper you can go into the con&s;ideration of a &s;ubject &s;o truly important to us all, I he&s;itate not to recommend it to you." C&mdash; J&mdash;'s Charge to the Grand Jury of Richmond county, March 1784. "The Con&s;titution of our country contains the principles of liberty, which by attention may be improved into a ba&s;is on which the happine&s;s of the community may re&s;t with &s;ecurity&mdash;<HI>the time however for any kind of alteration is not yet ar|rived.</HI>" Same C&mdash; J&mdash;'s Charge to the Grand Jury of Wilkes county, November 1784. He al&s;o, in his Charge in Liberty county in March la&s;t, after giving rea&s;ons why there was no time to be lo&s;t be|fore the Con&s;titution &s;hould be revi&s;ed and altered, goes on to tell the Grand Jury, as a &s;pur to their in|du&s;try, that "people in the counties lying on Savan|nah river are promoting petitions for that end, and I &s;ubmit the example to your di&s;cretion and judg|ment." Whether the people on Savannah river were promoting petitions I know not, but, even were it otherwi&s;e, it &s;hews the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Judge in the bu&s;ine&s;s propo&s;ed, and is at lea&s;t as prai&s;e-worthy
<PB N="16" REF="018430_0017_0FA76BB1D430C708">as the &s;peech of one of our Governors, who, in the year 1779, told the A&s;&s;embly, by way of comfort, "that he had received authentick accounts that Swe|den and Denmark had become additional pillars, by acknowledging the Independence of America."</P>
<P>It has never been my wi&s;h, and, however provok|ed, never &s;hall be my endeavour, to develope the conduct of any man in office, further than I think the good of &s;ociety requires; with this profe&s;&s;ion, then, I hope I &s;hall not be charged with a de&s;ire to gratify private &s;pleen, or mini&s;ter to the pa&s;&s;ions or prejudices of party, if I make a candid &s;crutiny into &s;ome late deci&s;ions in Court. I &s;hall begin with the ca&s;e of a Mr. Fox, a native and citizen of Georgia, who &s;tood charged with murder.</P>
<P>On the arraignment of this per&s;on, it &s;eems, he offered for his plea, "that he was not bound by any law of this &s;tate previous to the Definitive Treaty of Peace." The Court, without farther ceremony, on motion of the pri&s;oner's Council, admitted him to bail. This defence, which was more properly in nature of a &s;pecial plea in bar, than to the juri&s;diction of the Court, could not be u&s;ed as an argument for indulgence to the pri&s;oner. Surely every evidence to &s;hew his plea to be good, which he could ever ob|tain, was now to be had; and if, in&s;tead of re&s;ting on the 6th Article of the Treaty, and &s;etting up a plea of pardon, he cho&s;e to ri&s;que his life upon this i&s;&s;ue, whether there was any law of the land again&s;t murder binding upon him prior to the Definitive Treaty of Peace, there was every rea&s;on for the Judges to &s;ettle the point without lo&s;s of time, le&s;t &s;o fatal a doctrine, &s;ubver&s;ive of the fir&s;t principles of freedom, which will not &s;uppo&s;e the law to be in the hands of any ma&s;ter, &s;hould impo&s;e it&s;elf upon others. The nice rea&s;oning upon the allegiance due to the &s;overeignty <HI>de facto,</HI> and that <HI>de jure,</HI> and the di&s;tinctions admitted, or not admitted, between the two, did not at all enter into this bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;imple point would have been, whether an u&s;urpation
<PB N="17" REF="018430_0018_0FA76BB280C3A5F0">virtually and <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> &s;u&s;pends the operation of all laws, as well tho&s;e again&s;t offences <HI>mala in &s;e</HI> as tho&s;e only <HI>mala prohibita:</HI> And I think, without recurring to the laws or adjudications in the reign of Henry VII. when the di&s;putes between the Hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter came to be terminated, or to tho&s;e of Charles II. after the Re&s;toration, the very article it|&s;elf in the Treaty of Peace is, by the &s;tronge&s;t impli|cation imaginable, a deadly wound to &s;uch a plea as this; for, &s;urely, if no crime had been committed, no pardon would have been nece&s;&s;ary. Thus cir|cum&s;tanced, the pri&s;oner's defence re&s;olved it&s;elf into a confe&s;&s;ion of the fact, but a denial of its criminality &s;o far as re&s;pected him. Some centuries ago, in a Roman Catholick country, when men carried di&s;pen|&s;ations in their pockets, &s;uch a plea might have been &s;anctioned by authority; but, at this period of time, <HI>and before &s;o haughty a tribunal as ours,</HI> it is a little a|&s;toni&s;hing that it could even be attended to; nay, more, that it &s;hould actually produce its intended effect, and, by a ba&s;e &s;acrifice of law and common &s;en&s;e, con&s;ult the mere &s;afety and conveniency of a &s;uppo&s;ed offender again&s;t the community. I wi&s;h to avoid &s;aying any thing that can in the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of view go to the merits of this unfortunate man's ca&s;e&mdash;let God and the Country be his judges&mdash;My ob&s;ervations are all meant to be confined to the conduct of the Court upon his bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>that</HI> I am free to pronounce highly cen&s;urable. Under the Habeas Corpus Act, (the principles whereof are incorporated into, and, by the 60th &s;ection, made a part of our Con&s;titution) had the pri&s;oner demanded his trial in the fir&s;t week of the term, or on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and had the Attorney General omitted to get the witne&s;&s;es for the &s;tate when he might have done &s;o, I grant that, in &s;uch ca&s;es, even murderers have &s;ometimes, by the Superior Courts, (to whom we confided great powers, and from whom is expected great prudence) been admitted to bail: But I believe this is the fir&s;t in&s;tance wherein a man,
<PB N="18" REF="018430_0019_0FA76BB340BC7618">again&s;t whom was found a bill of indictment for mur|der, has ever been <HI>ordered out</HI> upon bail where the pro&s;ecutors pre&s;&s;ed for trial, where the party him&s;elf had put his fate upon an i&s;&s;ue that could neither re|quire or admit witne&s;&s;es, and where &s;uch indulgence was not pretended to be craved on the foot of any &s;uppo&s;ed hard&s;hip inflicted by the other party. If it be &s;aid, it was on account of the perplexed &s;tate the Court was thrown into, when this new and unexpect|ed plea made its appearance, that the cau&s;e was ad|journed over, I reply, that is impo&s;&s;ible, for, if the Judges had ever read (and I will not &s;uppo&s;e the contrary) the ca&s;es of Townly, M'Donald, Storey, and a number of others, in Fo&s;ter's Crown Law, they would have found the &s;ubject &s;o copiou&s;ly and clearly handled, that, to be perfectly &s;tupid; and to be at a lo&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, would be the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>Did any man in the world believe this lenity aro&s;e from a &s;pirit of forbearance and mercy, or that there was the lea&s;t particle of the <HI>milk of human nature</HI> in the compo&s;ition of its author, Chri&s;tian charity would induce forgivene&s;s, and we &s;hould perhaps be won over to lo&s;e &s;ight of the fault in a tenderne&s;s for the motive; but, when it is beyond contradiction, that the <HI>gentle u&s;age</HI> this pri&s;oner met with &s;prung entirely from the part <HI>his</HI> connexions, and <HI>their</HI> connexions again, have acted, and continue to act, <HI>on the little &s;cale of politicks,</HI> it is too much for any man of &s;pirit, &s;en&s;e, or ju&s;tice, to tolerate it in a free country.</P>
<P>There is one other tran&s;action of the la&s;t Court which I mu&s;t take the liberty of &s;aying a few words upon: I &s;hall, I expect, be anticipated, in being &s;uppo&s;ed to allude to the ca&s;e between an Indian and a Jew; God forbid I &s;hould feel, or be &s;u&s;pected of recommending, the mo&s;t di&s;tant enmity on a religious &s;core again&s;t either of the&s;e people; I mean to re|gulate my ob&s;ervations by the rules of policy, as the affair re&s;pects the publick, and by the eternal laws of ju&s;tice and truth, as it concerns the parties them|&s;elves. It &s;eems a half-breed man, de&s;cended of a
<PB N="19" REF="018430_0020_0FA76BB460CB4B50">white father (who is al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the race of Jacob) and a free Indian mother, had brought a &s;uit again&s;t a full-blooded Jew; the Jew, ever upon the watch, took an exception again&s;t the right of the plaintiff to &s;ue. There was really &s;omething &s;o pe|culiarly droll, in a conte&s;t about privilege between two men of this de&s;cription in a Chri&s;tian country, that, when I fir&s;t heard of it, I could not help re|peating a very vulgar &s;aying of the pot to the kettle; however, the matter being referred to the Court, two again&s;t one decided in favour of the <HI>I&s;raelite,</HI> and the poor <HI>Creekite</HI> was ordered to <HI>imparl</HI> until he could prove <HI>red</HI> was <HI>white.</HI> This naturally led me to in|quire what were the rights of a free Indian, and what were tho&s;e of a Jew, in this &s;tate. As it appeared to be at lea&s;t a diverting &s;peculation, I devoted &s;ome time to the inquiry, and, if the reader feels the &s;ame curio&s;ity I did, he will not grudge a few minutes ex|traordinary in peru&s;ing their re&s;pective claims. And now to the point: By the common law of the land the Indian &s;eems to me to enjoy every privilege which the Jew does; and by the local Con&s;titutions, or acts of A&s;&s;embly, he certainly enjoys &s;everal which the Jew does not. To elucidate the former part of this po&s;ition, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew in what light the&s;e people re&s;pectively &s;tood, and to con&s;ider whe|ther there was any di&s;crimination between them in England at the time our country was colonized from that kingdom, for I conceive that to be the common law of this land (indeed our Legi&s;lature hath declar|ed &s;o) which was the law of England at the time our charter is dated, to wit, on the 9th day of June, 1732. When a free people (&s;ay the writers on this head) migrate to a new &s;oil, with intent to &s;ettle the &s;ame, they carry with them as their birthright all the laws of their mother country then in force, at lea&s;t &s;o much thereof as may be applicable to their own &s;ituation and the condition of an infant colony. This being acknowledged as a po&s;tulatum, let us now &s;ee what that law was.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="018430_0021_0FA76BB4BB89B300">
Judge Black&s;tone, in his Commentaries, (vol 1, page 425.) &s;peaking of the protection granted in England even to Negroes who run away from their ma&s;ters in America, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: "The law of England acts upon general and exten&s;ive prin|ciples&mdash;it gives liberty rightly under&s;tood, that is, protection to a Jew, a Turk, or a Heathen, as well as to tho&s;e who profe&s;s the true religion of Chri&s;t." So that we &s;ee the Jew &s;tands upon a level with the African &s;lave who de&s;erts the employment of his ma&s;ter. Now, &s;urely, we will not &s;uppo&s;e a free Indian to be in a &s;ituation wor&s;e than a man of this de&s;cription, but rather in a better; and by &s;o much as his &s;ituation is better than that of the Negro, in the &s;ame ratio does he, from the words of Mr. Black|&s;tone, ri&s;e above the Jew. The only difficulty with me is, whether we ought not to con&s;ider the Indians within our &s;tate, and who are the aborigines of the &s;oil, rather in the light of citizens than aliens. There is no moral ob&s;tacle to &s;uch a determination in re&s;pect to the&s;e people, as there is to the Jews, who are not at pre&s;ent con&s;idered as citizens in any part of the world but by the &s;pecial favour and operation of &s;ome particular law. And this carries me to the &s;e|cond part of my po&s;ition, viz. a view of the local Con&s;titutions or acts of A&s;&s;embly in favour of the In|dians: The&s;e will be found to countenance very much the idea of citizen&s;hip which I have before advanced. An act, pa&s;&s;ed 25th March, 1765, in the fir&s;t clau&s;e, expre&s;sly &s;ecures every right and privilege to the In|dians in amity with us, which they ever enjoyed. In the 13th and 14th &s;ections of the &s;ame law it is clearly implied, that, in the opinion of the then Le|gi&s;lature, the&s;e people were at all times, and upon all occa&s;ions, to be e&s;teemed as being preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame footing with Mulattoes or Meztizoes (or Jews or Turks) actually naturalized by a &s;pecial act of A&s;&s;embly. And it is well known that Indians, and the de&s;cendants of Indian women, have, in a variety of in&s;tances, both under the pre&s;ent and for|mer
<PB N="21" REF="018430_0022_0FA76BB853834510">government, had grants of lands to them and their heirs, which is of it&s;elf conclu&s;ive evidence they were acknowledged to be citizens. But, even &s;hould we admit they were not citizens, they certainly are entitled to the rights of free aliens: What tho&s;e rights are no man who has read Wood's In&s;titutes, or turned over Jacob's Law Dictionary, can be ig|norant of; but I &s;hall make no comments, nor de|tain the reader further than whil&s;t I tran&s;cribe <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> pa&s;&s;ages out of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> very common books: "An alien may bring an action concerning per&s;onal property, and may make a will and di&s;po&s;e of his per&s;onal e&s;tate: This is to be under&s;tood of alien friends only, or &s;uch who&s;e countries are in <HI>peace</HI> with ours." 1 Black. 372. Here we &s;ee, if the Indians are merely in <HI>peace</HI> it is &s;ufficient; but they are more, they are actually in <HI>alliance</HI> with us, and therefore a judicial opinion incapacitating them from the right of &s;uit is neither law or ju&s;tice. "All per&s;onal acti|ons he (an alien) may &s;ue as on a bond, &s;o likewi&s;e for words, for the common law, according to the laws of nations, protects trade and traffick; and not to have the benefit of the law in &s;uch ca&s;es is to deny trade." Yelv. 198. Moore, 431. "An alien enemy commorant (or tarrying) in England by the King's licen&s;e, and under his protection, may maintain ac|tions of debt upon bond, although he came not with &s;afe conduct." Lord Raymond, 282. Here we &s;ee, if the Indians were actually at war with us, yet, by the common law of England, (which we have adopted as the law of our land) if we permit any one of them to tarry among us, he is not di&s;abled from bringing &s;uit even again&s;t a <HI>Chri&s;tian citizen.</HI> But I &s;hall now quit my Creek friend, and proceed to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of the Jews, a people who&s;e increa&s;e in any coun|try is at once a compliment and a reflection upon it; a compliment upon its natural advantages, but an implied cen&s;ure upon its moral &s;y&s;tem or admini&s;tra|tion of government. An ancient writer ob&s;erves, the Jews always in&s;inuate them&s;elves mo&s;t into favour
<PB N="22" REF="018430_0023_0FA76BB9F41AF188">among tho&s;e nations who remain in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadows of death. I &s;hall not wa&s;te my own time, or tre&s;pa&s;s on the reader's patience, in demon&s;trating whether the&s;e people ought mo&s;t to be tolerated in a republick or in a monarchy. In truth the Jews now-a-days enter very little into politicks further than to favour that &s;y&s;tem which is mo&s;t promotive of their pecuniary intere&s;t, the principle of lucre being the life and &s;oul of all their actions. If indeed they have any choice as to governments, it mu&s;t be in favour of a monarchy, for there are no people &s;o wedded to their old in&s;titutions as the Jews, and we all know that, from the earlie&s;t accounts, they have been ac|cu&s;tomed to an arbitrary, though not always to an hereditary government. At fir&s;t the fathers of fa|milies, and the elde&s;t &s;ons after them, exerci&s;ed un|limited power, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as kings and prie&s;ts, over the re&s;t; they had authority to ble&s;s, cur&s;e, ca&s;t out, di&s;inherit, or puni&s;h with death, as they thought proper, in their own hou&s;es. In Mo&s;es's time the civil juri&s;diction came to be &s;e|vered from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but with no abatement of power or rigour in either; for whil&s;t Mo&s;es, and after him Jo&s;hua, were ab&s;olute leaders, Aaron and his po&s;terity were high prie&s;ts, more arbitrary than &s;ub&s;equent popes. After the&s;e came judges, who, when once elected into office, were as de&s;potic as dictators; and the &s;anhedrim, who filled up the cha&s;m between judge and judge, had al&s;o very great powers conferred on them. The whole concluded in a monarchy, beginning with Saul, and continuing until the Captivity. They were after that event for a long time bandied about under the Per&s;ian mon|archs, and the ten captains of Alexander the Great. At length the &s;ceptre was entirely removed from the Hou&s;e of Judah, and came to be ve&s;ted in King Herod, who was of a branch no ways de&s;cended from the <HI>holy stock.</HI> At what particular time they came into England is not a&s;certained; however they cer|tainly were there in the time of William the Con|queror,
<PB N="23" REF="018430_0024_0FA76BBB60666730">for we find in hi&s;tory that that monarch, for a large &s;um of money, granted the Jews the privilege of living in a certain part of England <HI>as his mere va&s;|&s;als, their per&s;ons and goods to be con&s;idered as his alone, and they were to di&s;po&s;e of neither without his licen&s;e.</HI> They continued in &s;uch &s;ituation, with the addition of &s;ome few privileges, never as citizens, but, ac|cording to Molloy, (vol. 2d, pages 293 and 294,) <HI>"as mo&s;t ab&s;olute bond &s;laves and exqui&s;ite villains, obliged to wear a badge and table on their outmo&s;t garment, as well females as males, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from Chri&s;tians, and not privileged to &s;ue but by &s;pecial licen&s;e of the king,"</HI> until their in&s;olence, oppre&s;&s;ions, and u&s;ury, not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e re&s;traints, had ri&s;en to &s;uch a heighth as to become a grievance to the nation. Then it was that Edward I. in the 18th year of his reign, at the earne&s;t &s;olicitation of his Commons, publi&s;hed an edict in Parliament for the total and ab&s;olute ba|ni&s;hment of all Jews from every part of his dominions, and if, after a limited time, any of them were found within the &s;ame, they were to be hanged. The ac|counts of the&s;e times tell us, they had proceeded &s;o far in their &s;uper&s;titious wickedne&s;s, that it became a cu&s;tom among them, on a Good Friday, to &s;teal a Chri&s;tian child, and privately to crucify him in deri|&s;ion of his religion. From that time the Jews &s;tood bani&s;hed the dominions of England until the great civil war in the reign of Charles I. During the confu|&s;ions of that period, they, by &s;ome means or other, with the help of long pur&s;es, found an opportunity of reintroducing them&s;elves; they remained, how|ever, extremely limited in their privileges, up to the time out charter was granted; nay, it was not until the commencement of the pre&s;ent century that they were admitted to the common privilege of benefit of clergy in any ca&s;e whatever. (See Fo&s;ter's Crown Law, 306.)</P>
<P>Thus I have travelled with the Jews through a wilderne&s;s of hi&s;tory, from the time of their patriarchs down to the &s;ettlement of Georgia; if I have been
<PB N="24" REF="018430_0025_0FA76BBB8D362808">particular or lengthy, the reader will excu&s;e it, when he reflects it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew in what light the Jews &s;tood in England when our fir&s;t &s;ettlers emigrat|ed from that country, in order to a&s;certain the privi|leges they are now entitled to in Georgia; for I do not know that a &s;ingle law has ever been pa&s;&s;ed by our own Legi&s;lature in their favour, either before or &s;ince the Revolution. As to the 56th article of our Con&s;titution, it &s;ays no more for them than it does for the Bramins of China, or the Mu&s;&s;ulmen of Tur|key, <HI>they &s;hall have the free exerci&s;e of their religion, provided it be not repugnant to the peace and &s;afety of the &s;tate.</HI> Whether this <HI>provi&s;o,</HI> applied to the Jews, does not abrogate the preceeding words, I refer to the opinion of others; at all events, there is nothing in it that promi&s;es them any more than a more reli|gious privilege; not a word in the whole clau&s;e, by the mo&s;t forced con&s;truction, can be made to &s;ig|nify a grant of any civil right whatever. I am aware the&s;e people have hitherto laid great &s;tre&s;s on the &s;tatutes of 13th and 20th Geo. II. and 2d Geo. III. which make two years &s;ervice in a military capacity, or &s;even years con&s;tant re&s;idence in America, work a naturalization in any Jew; but a moment's reflection will convince us the&s;e &s;tatutes are rather again&s;t the Jews than for them, as matters now &s;tand; they evi|dently imply and prove, that, by the common or o|ther laws of force, previous to the 13th Geo. II. there was &s;ome moral ob&s;tacle in the way of a Jew's acquiring the rights of citizen&s;hip in America which could only be removed by the authority of Parlia|ment. Now, this being admitted, the only que&s;tion will be, whether the&s;e &s;tatutes are of force in Geor|gia or not. This is a que&s;tion that turns upon the &s;ame hinge that the Stamp Act, the Tea Act, and all the other acts which we declared uncon&s;titutional, did; the criterion was not the expediency of the&s;e laws, but the right in the makers to bind us by them. The people of Georgia cea&s;ed to be repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Parliament in the 5th year of the reign of
<PB N="25" REF="018430_0026_0FA76BBC4217EB50">George II. when they migrated to this new &s;oil; the fir&s;t of the&s;e Jew Acts was pa&s;&s;ed eight years af|terwards; then &s;urely, upon the very principles of our Revolution, it cannot be con&s;idered as of force here without having been adopted by our own Le|gi&s;lature; <HI>that</HI> never having been done, the conclu|&s;ion in the brea&s;t of every Revolutioni&s;t inevitably is, that the Jews in Georgia at pre&s;ent &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing they did in England in the year 1732; what that footing was I have already &s;hewn to be that of aliens, who never can become citizens but by the aid of the Legi&s;lature. Indeed every man knows that at this day no Jew becomes a citizen in England but by virtue of a &s;pecial act of Parliament for naturaliz|ing him. There is &s;carcely a &s;e&s;&s;ion but &s;everal of the&s;e laws pa&s;s, which are &s;aid to co&s;t, one way or other, near 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> each. The terms of naturalization even then amount to this, that the Jew &s;hall renounce his errors and turn Chri&s;tian, which he is obliged to evidence by taking the &s;acrament, as required by &s;tat. 7th James I. There was, in the 16th year of George II. an attempt made, and an act actually pa&s;&s;ed, for di&s;pen&s;ing with the te&s;t of the &s;acrament in re&s;pect to Jews before they were naturalized, but the clamours of the people ro&s;e &s;o high that the Par|liament were compelled, after a very few months trial, to repeal this law, and leave the Jews where they were before.</P>
<P>After having &s;aid &s;o much again&s;t the Jews, it may probably be &s;u&s;pected I am not only an enemy, but that I wi&s;h to &s;tir up a &s;pirit of intolerance again&s;t that di&s;per&s;ed and unhappy people. Let me tell the reader, I am as far removed from being a votary of friend to per&s;ecution as any man upon earth. Had the Jews in this &s;tate but conducted them&s;elves with common mode&s;ty and decorum, I &s;hould have been the la&s;t per&s;on to point out their di&s;abilities; on the contrary, I &s;hould have been hap|py to give my voice for &s;ectling every ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable privilege upon them, or even to have gone
<PB N="26" REF="018430_0027_0FA76BBD00AE4930">farther, and permitted them to enjoy by <HI>curte&s;y &s;ome</HI> which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to concede of <HI>right</HI> in any Chri&s;tian country. But, when we &s;ee the&s;e people eternally obtruding them&s;elves as volunteers upon every publick occa&s;ion, one day a&s;&s;uming the lead at an election, the next taking upon them to direct the police of the town, and the third daring to pa&s;s as jurors upon the life and death of a free man, what are we to expect but to have Chri&s;tianity <HI>enacted into</HI> a capital here&s;y, the &s;ynagogue become the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church, and the mildne&s;s of the New Te&s;tament compelled to give place to the rigour and &s;everity of the Old? The mo&s;t di&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of which e|vils is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e any man into action who values either his civil or religious liberty.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid that no people can be blamed for pu&s;hing their preten&s;ions as far as they are permitted, that it is in the nature of man to thir&s;t after privilege and pre-eminence as much as it is af|ter money, and that therefore it is not to the Jews, but to our Chri&s;tian officers, we ought to impute the blame. All this I will in &s;ome mea&s;ure grant, but, at the &s;ame time, de&s;ire leave to remind the&s;e people they &s;tand exceedingly in their own light, when they venture &s;o far under the au&s;pices of any one man, e&s;pecially an officer who&s;e office, and in all probability who&s;e con&s;equence, will expire with the year.</P>
<P>The Jews are a race of men well acquainted with the &s;corns and per&s;ecution of all the re&s;t of the world: Surely, then, it was a mo&s;t forward, not to &s;ay un|guarded action, in one of the&s;e, who&s;e religious &s;i|tuation makes him the mo&s;t vulnerable man on earth, to endeavour to disfranchi&s;e an Indian of a privilege which he him&s;elf held by the &s;lender tenure of good-will; indeed, if we believe Mr. Adair, in his Hi&s;tory of the Indians, we might go farther, and call it a mo&s;t <HI>injudaic</HI> action, for that writer &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ts the Creek Indians and the Jews are very nearly allied; he hazards a conjecture that the former are
<PB N="27" REF="018430_0028_0FA76BBDD30C6760">really and truly one of the Tribes of Jacob, who came, by &s;ome means or other, to be lo&s;t in the wilds of America.</P>
<P>I cannot take my leave of the Jews without &s;aying a word more as a tribute to ju&s;tice, and I do no more than this, when I acknowledge there is one whole family (and perhaps to the&s;e might be added two or three other individuals) who&s;e long re&s;idence, upright demeanour, and inoffen&s;ive conduct, in this &s;tate, have always claimed, and now procure for them, the countenance and e&s;teem of every hone&s;t Chri&s;tian; the only <HI>badge</HI> I ever wi&s;h to &s;ee any of this hou&s;e, or their connexions, (e&s;pecially the fe|males, who are by far the large&s;t part) wear, is what they have always carried, "the approbation of the good." It is really remarkable that, in the bittere&s;t moods again&s;t this &s;ingular people, there &s;hould always occur <HI>a remnant to be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Were I di&s;po&s;ed, as I really am not, to canva&s;s every act of the Judiciary that appeared liable to re|prehen&s;ion, I could fill volumes in&s;tead of a &s;ingle pamphlet; but I confe&s;s my&s;elf already tired with a &s;ubject which exhibits nothing but memorials <HI>on the dark &s;ide of human nature.</HI> As far as lies with the Head of this Department, it is obvious to all that the end of one ridiculous &s;ituation is only the beginning of another. Had this gentleman any feeling, he mu&s;t be convinced his conduct is not approved of by the country: the very common compliment of thanks for his charge is withhold in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t pre&s;entments that I have &s;een; and no wonder, when the main &s;cope of &s;uch charges was to &s;tir up parties and di&s;&s;en&s;ions throughout the land; in&s;tead of being a pre&s;erver of the peace, as his oath and duty require of him, it is evidently his object to di&s;turb the repo&s;e, and thereby impede the welfare of the community. The Grand Jury of Chatham county gave but an <HI>inkling</HI> of the light in which they viewed him; and why an oppor|tunity was not afforded to the people of Effingham to convey their &s;en&s;e, in the form of pre&s;entments, is
<PB N="28" REF="018430_0029_0FA76BBE8CC9E148">a matter that the Repre&s;entatives of that county will no doubt demand an explanation of.</P>
<P>It was my intention to have &s;aid &s;omething on the famous adjudication re&s;pecting our trade; but as that point has been already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by others, and as I have exceeded the limits I had pre&s;cribed for my&s;elf. I &s;hall leave &s;o <HI>unfounded a the&s;is</HI> to peri&s;h by its own ab&s;urdity and impolicy. The idea of a Treaty of Commerce being nece&s;&s;ary to entitle a foreigner to &s;ue for a debt is too puerile to de&s;erve a &s;erious refu|tation. If this were <HI>law,</HI> we could have no trade with Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ru&s;&s;ia, and half the other powers of Europe, together with all tho&s;e of A&s;ia and Africa.</P>
<P>Were it an article of our political creed that the freedom of a people depended on the emptine&s;s of their Trea&s;ury, there could not be more backward|ne&s;s than there is in the payment of publick debts. In February la&s;t, an act pa&s;&s;ed, laying an impo&s;t upon &s;hipping, and a duty on goods imported. This would prove &s;ome aid to our Trea&s;ury, were the mo|nies collected, but unfortunately a clau&s;e, granting four months indulgence to all who &s;hould de&s;ire it, was annexed to the law, and the con&s;equence has been, that, when the duties came once to be <HI>bonded,</HI> the parties either con&s;idered the debt as paid, or pro|cured drafts upon the Trea&s;ury &s;ufficient to balance the account by the time it became due. In either ca&s;e no ca&s;h is brought into the Trea&s;ury: And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I con&s;ider the&s;e circulating Trea|&s;ury notes as big with evil con&s;equences; at be&s;t they are mere expedients, generated <HI>by the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion,</HI> and all expedients in government im|ply a defect in the organization or conduct of the machine. Every draft is an anticipation of &s;o much of our funds; and, if we go on without know|ing or determining preci&s;ely how far we may afford to anticipate, the con&s;equence <HI>may</HI> be, that the ex|penditures of one year will mortgage the revenue of ten.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="018430_0030_0FA76BBF6154CA88">
The general account of our fi&s;cal concerns for the pre&s;ent year, not yet being laid before the publick, I am unable to &s;ay any thing about them. I &s;hould however imagine that our expences, with the utmo&s;t frugality, and although we have had but one &s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;embly, cannot full &s;hort of 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> In this &s;um I do not include one &s;ixpence of what we owe on the federal &s;core. It would a&s;toni&s;h nine tenths of the people to hear, if my information is ju&s;t, what a bagatelle has been as yet brought into the Trea&s;ury to oppo&s;e to this &s;um. The la&s;t year had no &s;uch difficulties to &s;truggle with as the pre&s;ent, for al|though the taxes were trifling, yet the amercements and ca&s;h &s;ales were very con&s;iderable.

<P>I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent make any particular remarks on the fund ari&s;ing from our confi&s;cated property. The amount &s;ales were indeed prodigious, but what will be the neat balance after payment of the debts of the&s;e pro&s;cribed per&s;ons I can form no probable gue&s;s. I have heard that, when the A&s;&s;embly la&s;t &s;at, the bonds in the Trea&s;ury on that account amounted to 288,253<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 19<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> how many more have been brought in &s;ince I know not.</P>
<P>There are, I believe, many and great demands &s;till remaining again&s;t the&s;e e&s;tates; what channel they will next be thrown into for liquidation and &s;ettlement I am unapprized of; in my judgment there can be none &s;o proper, or conducive to publick good, as that of the Auditor.
