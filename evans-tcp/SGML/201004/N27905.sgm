<HEAD>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE time in which we live, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by great and extraordinary events; it is an age of intrigue and di&s;&s;imulation, of folly and jealou&s;y, of revolutions and convul&s;ions. All the pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart are in a ferment, and every rational be|ing from the throne to the cottage is agitated by the picture&s;que circum&s;tances of the day. Although re|moved upwards of three thou&s;and miles from the &s;an|guinary theatre of Europe, our public and private Councils are influenced, bia&s;&s;ed and &s;ometimes deranged by foreign intrigue, dome&s;tic ambition, and impa&s;&s;ion|ed factions. The &s;word of the Revolution is &s;carcely returned to its &s;cabbard, and the &s;acred wounds of our patriots are &s;till open and bleeding. Yet plans are organized, at this early hour, to bla&s;t the pro&s;pe|rity, and undermine the liberties of our country. By pecuniary doceurs, emigration and flatteries, the cau&s;e of monarchy has taken root in the hearts of the ignorant and the unwary. But there is an enlighten|ed &s;pirit in our country to re&s;i&s;t its progre&s;s. 1776 is not yet forgotten, and &s;ilent millions are in readine&s;s to &s;acrifice their lives on the altar of public liberty; they have &s;worn to &s;upport the Con&s;titution of their choice, and to pre&s;erve it inviolable from the machi|nations
<PB N="4" REF="037170_0003_100CD670177D8108">
of ambition, and the &s;port of arbitrary power. We are not yet ripe enough for unconditional &s;ub|mition. Liberty is not yet de&s;poiled of her charms, nor &s;lavery deprived of it horrors, and the yeomanry are not yet prepared to render up homage, and feed on a &s;canty pittance in mi&s;ery and in tears. Until you can corrupt the moral features of man, he regards his liberty as the in&s;eparable companion of his life.</P>
<P>You have vainly endeavoured to repel the charge of monarchi&s;m which has a thou&s;and times been reiter|ated from Newhamp&s;hire to Georgia. Although the Anglo-European feels him&s;elf at home in your &s;ociety, experience affords a le&s;&s;on of caution to the genuine American. The proceedings of the General Conven|tion bear witne&s;s again&s;t you, e&s;tabli&s;h beyond con|trover&s;y, your attatchment to arbitrary government, and the information of the Attorney General of Ma|ryland, marks you out as the daring enemy of repub|licani&s;m. In this ever memorable di&s;grace Morris took a part, under the di&s;appointed expectation of ba&s;king and fattening in the &s;un&s;hine of courtly favour. When all your &s;chemes proved abortive: When you found it impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e a Guelph to the throne, did you not a&s;&s;ert that the Con&s;titution would an&s;wer your purpo&s;e, as it opened a latitude for the encroachments of arbitray power? Whil&s;t Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, was it not your earne&s;t endeavour to a&s;&s;imilate our government to that of Great-Britain? She offered you a &s;y&s;tem of Finance that has drawn tears from mi&s;erable millions, and you &s;ervilely adopted it. The evil con&s;equences of this adoption, are not yet fully felt, although it has filled this infant republic with &s;tock-jobbers, &s;peculators, and peculators. Although it has robbed the hoary &s;oldier of his labours, and left him to wander with his family and his wounds on an
<PB N="5" REF="037170_0004_100CD6719D01FAC8">
unfeeling world, whil&s;t the friends of Moloch and of George are &s;eated in triumph, and environed with wealth. But this is not the only evidence that ju&s;tifies the opinion of the Pre&s;ident. Whoever has analized your character, and drawn a&s;ide the veil of di&s;&s;imula|tion, mu&s;t feel an irre&s;i&s;tible conviction that nature has made ambition the principle lever of all your actions. What a painful mortification to be excluded from the Councils of your country! Cannot we here draw forth the motives that originated your illiberal attack on the character of the Pre&s;ident, who had too much judgment and independence to &s;ubmit to the leading &s;trings of the ex-Secretary? Here was di&s;appointed am|bition; here was abundant rea&s;on to libel Mr. Adams, and injure the cau&s;e of his party; here is a clue to that my&s;terious character, who&s;e power, if equal to his will, would be&s;tride the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t prominent charge again&s;t Mr Adams, is, his inability to admini&s;ter the government; that he has an imagination "&s;ublimated and eccentric" that his judgment is defective, and that he is incapable of a &s;teady adherence to any &s;y&s;tematic plan of conduct. How is this e&s;tabli&s;hed? You have under&s;tood, but cannot vouch for its authenticity, that Mr. Adams was the friend and advocate of annual enli&s;tments, and argued the propriety of changing the commander in chief every year. On evidence &s;o &s;lender, no man &s;hould be convicted, if, however, they really were his &s;entiments, they demon&s;tate a prudent jea|lou&s;y &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in revolutionary times; he &s;aw in the hi&s;tory of other ages and nations, the de|&s;tructive evils that had re&s;ulted from the unlimited and unconditional grant of power. A &s;tanding &s;oldery will become attatched to their chief, and an ambitious chief, when a favourable opportunity occurs, will
<PB N="6" REF="037170_0005_100CD6732F83F4A8">
&s;trike at the vitals of his country, and riot on the grave of public happine&s;s. The days of Cae&s;ar with their tragical features are &s;till fre&s;h in our memories, they will plead to the late&s;t ages, the folly and impo|licy of a permanent military, and a permanent leader. It is further urged, that our country was deficient in characters qualified to command, and that Wa&s;hing|ton was alone capable of uniting the intere&s;ts of the country, and combining together a naked, ill-fed, and undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiery. This &s;ugge&s;tion is palpably fal&s;e, and unworthy of a &s;erious refutation. I feel a veneration for Wa&s;hington, and emotions of gratitude for his di&s;intere&s;ted exertions which no tongue can adequately expre&s;s. But at the time of his appoint|ment to the chief command, his principles and milita|ry virtues were little known. A circum&s;tance that ju&s;tified the want of too implicit confidence on the part of Mr. Adams.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations relative to a certain private jour|nal of Mr. Adams, are &s;urpa&s;&s;ingly trivial and low, they demon&s;trate the imbecility of your cau&s;e, and point out the ba&s;e malignity of your heart. The inci|dent with madam Vergennes, on which you have commented as if it was a matter of moment, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of the turn you have given it, without a gro&s;s and violent di&s;tortion of common &s;en&s;e. You, perhaps might have &s;ucceeded better on that occa&s;ion, if any thing more had been <HI>nece&s;&s;ary than a pecuniary gratification.</HI></P>
<P>The letter of Mr. Adams to Tench Coxe, which has given ri&s;e to &s;o many illiberal comments, was evi|dently written in &s;ome jocular moment. The &s;tyle is &s;imple, unaffected, and &s;eemingly as if not intended, announces &s;ome very important truths and well au|thenticated facts. The circum&s;tance of the Pinckney's
<PB N="7" REF="037170_0006_100CD6D35BAA65C0">
having been &s;chool fellows of the Marquis of Car|marthan, is not of &s;o very trifling and indifferent a na|ture. Prejudices formed at an early period of life &s;eldom for&s;ake us, they modify character, and give an unchangeable colouring to the moral atributes of man.</P>
<P>Is the &s;u&s;picion of Mr. Adams re&s;pecting Briti&s;h in|fluence without rea&s;onable foundations? Has not Great-Britain from the earlie&s;t times, endeavoured to an&s;wer her purpo&s;e by intrigue and by money when incapable by the force of arms? Is it forgotten what was attempted on a member of Congre&s;s during the revolutinary war? Have not the Councils of France been di&s;tracted and continually annoyed by the&s;e ba&s;e engines of national corruption? Have not the leading characters in admini&s;tration uniformly evinced the warme&s;t affection for the court of St. James, when the Amba&s;&s;adors of France were rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed? Have you not in common with your party occa&s;ional|ly forgotten that you was an American, and warmly panegeri&s;ed the government of Great Britain? In fine, have not the agents of that country been the inmates of your heart, and acce&s;&s;ible to the &s;ecrets of our cabinet? Under circum&s;tances &s;o &s;trong and impre&s;|&s;ive is there a loop left to hang a doubt on?</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of this remarkable letter contains a pro|phecy that has long &s;ince been fulfilled. "The con|tinual acce&s;&s;ion of foreigners will endanger and de|&s;troy our peace, if we know not how to govern them; they will moreover corrupt our elections, and tear us to pieces." Will any man who bears the &s;malle&s;t ve|neration for truth, deny this unhappy fact? The fede|rali&s;t and the monarchi&s;t, who meet in more points than they differ, have waged an inveterate warfare with the republican intere&s;t of this country; in the
<PB N="8" REF="037170_0007_100CE0B066ABBC08">
city of New-York, in particular, many Engli&s;hmen, hot from the country of crimes and &s;lavery, have en|deavoured, with federal aid, to controul and corrupt our elections. Our laws of naturalization have ad|mitted the&s;e vipers in our bo&s;om, and nothing but republican energy has hitherto &s;upported the endan|gered liberty of our country.</P>
<P>When you became a member of Congre&s;s, your accute penetration di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of a party already formed, too well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubject the in|tere&s;t of the United States to the management of France, which you re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t. Was it not at once natural and rea&s;onable, that we &s;hould feel the warme&s;t emotions of gratitude towards a power that relieved us in the hour of danger, difficulty, and ne|ce&s;&s;ity? Would it not have been the ba&s;e&s;t inju&s;tice, to have forgotten in a moment, the liberal &s;ervices that were rendered us at that eventful period? There is ground to pre&s;ume that you have mi&s;taken this ho|ne&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m, for an undue compliance to foreign power, and that this want of di&s;cernment originated the party of which you have &s;o long been the pui&s;|&s;ant leader. If this has been the only cau&s;e of your per&s;ecutions, charge it to your ignorance, and hold your&s;elf accountable for the mi&s;chiefs you have invit|ed on your country, by fomenting divi&s;ions and di&s;|tracting its councils. Wi&s;hing to derogate as much as po&s;&s;ible from the merit of Mr. Adams, you hold up Mr. Jay as principal negociator in our fir&s;t treaty with Great-Britain. No certain determination can be formed on this point, but every candid thinker will deny your po&s;ition, if he reflects on Mr. Jays la&s;t negociation with the &s;ame power; when an in&s;tru|ment was formed inexpre&s;&s;ibly de&s;tructive to the com|mercial intere&s;t of this country, his friend endeavour|ed
<PB N="9" REF="037170_0008_100CE0B1F8579968">
to poultice its defects, but all the &s;ophi&s;try and ravings of Camillus were in vain. Daily experience developes its evils, and many of its warme&s;t abettors are now its mo&s;t inveterate enemies.</P>
<P>Much is &s;aid on Mr. Adam's complaint of unfair treatment, in not having been permitted to take an equal chance with Wa&s;hington, by leaving the votes to an uninfluenced current. As this fact is not well authenticated, it will be di&s;credited or confided in, ac|cording to your moral re&s;pectability; in truth Mr. Adams has long been an hone&s;t and faithful &s;ervant of his country, and his &s;trenuous exertions during the revolution, were, perhaps as e&s;&s;ential to our indepen|dence, as the more brilliant atchievements of General Wa&s;hington<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the opinion entertained by the friends of Mr. Adams, and not by the author of this pamphlet, and tho&s;e who know how to e&s;ti|mate characters.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With how much grace and art have you endea|voured to draw a parallel between the character of Pinckney and Wa&s;hington. It is a misfortune for your candidate that he is &s;o little known in the world. Has he been an indifferent &s;pectator of the intere&s;ting events of the times? Has he willfully excluded him|&s;elf from public affairs, when the difficulties of his country was in want of &s;uch ennobling qualifications? Or is he notwith&s;tanding your encomiums incapable of the duties of a &s;tate&s;man? How many impo&s;itions have been practi&s;ed in every age and country, through the impul&s;e of folly, or the intrigue of ambition. If Heliogabilus could in&s;ult the Roman Senate by intro|ducing a hor&s;e to its councils; may not de&s;igning po|liticians have their views in advancing and promoting the election of an animal more particularly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
<PB N="10" REF="037170_0009_100CE0B3B6046E20">
by the length of his ears, than the energy of his mind.</P>
<P>From the late public addre&s;s of Tenck Coxe, what opinion is entertained of you by every hone&s;t and re|flecting American? Has he not proved to the world that you are the zealous friend of monarchical government, and con&s;equently a dangerous character under any re|publican &s;y&s;tem? Is it not to be pre&s;umed then, that the man you &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly advocate, has a heart that vibrates in uni&s;on with your own; that his principles are unfriendly to the general di&s;po&s;ition of his coun|try; and that on every favourable opportunity he would endeavour to fret away the great and e&s;&s;ential principles of the federal con&s;titution? But your &s;an|guine expectations are defeated, and the genuine friend of his country, the meritorious Jeffer&s;on is de&s;tined to pre&s;ide over a great and free people: The whole tenor of his life is capable of the mo&s;t rigid &s;crutiny; uninfluenced by intere&s;t, by flattery, or by money; like Marcus Curius Dentatus, he can point to his turnips and &s;purn at the bribes of the <HI>Samnites.</HI> The mo&s;t flattering encomiums are pa&s;&s;ed on Mr. Pinck|ney for having effected a favorable treaty with the court of Madrid. It is a&s;&s;erted that many thorny difficulties exi&s;ted between the two countries, and that his &s;ucce&s;sful negociation was therefore de&s;erving of the highe&s;t commendation. Every man who is ac|quainted with the circum&s;tances of the&s;e times, who recollects the parali&s;ed condition of Spain, will de|termine without he&s;itation, that &s;ome better te&s;t is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the political con&s;equence of Mr. Pinckney. It is well known, that the Spani&s;h territo|ries, on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, was by them&s;elves con&s;idered a very precarious tenure, and that if equal advantage had been withheld, a &s;pirit beyond the mountains
<PB N="11" REF="037170_0010_100CE0B6588C12A8">
would have ju&s;tified its pretentions under the force of arms. How di&s;tingui&s;hed then is the merit of this de|&s;ervedly unknown man! This great and &s;triking like|ne&s;s of the immortal Wa&s;hington! It is not my in|tention to hold up Mr. Adams as an immaculate character, but candor requires that he &s;hould be re&s;|cued from di&s;gu&s;ting calumnies, which envy, ma|lice and di&s;appointed ambition have heaped upon him. His theory of Government is congenial with your own and Mr. Pinckneys' &s;entiments; it breathes de&s;truction to the freedom and happine&s;s of man; it &s;eeks the aggrandizement of a few, and the pro&s;|tration and deba&s;ement of one moiety of &s;ociety. When a theory is far advanced in the minds of men, the practice marches quick in the rear, circum&s;pection and fear may retard its movements, but every favora|ble incident for experiment accelerates its progre&s;s; for many years after the revolution the American people were un&s;u&s;pecting and happy, the &s;miles of peace were acceptable after the arduous toils of war. The &s;word was forgotten except in &s;ome innocent evening tale, and the mo&s;t unlimited confidence was repo&s;ed in the leaders of the government, the wilde&s;t credulity could not have imagined at that early hour, that tho&s;e who had &s;hared in the hard&s;hips of the &s;trug|gle, were meditating to bla&s;t the fruits of a glorious revolution. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, poi&s;onous and infectious principles were di&s;&s;eminated, a conciliatory &s;pirit towards Great-Britain was inculcated, and every practicable mea&s;ure pur&s;ued to &s;often the re&s;entment of the American people; to favour the plans of am|bition, gratitude was di&s;carded as a virtue, and an En|gli&s;h inveteracy was organized again&s;t the govern|ment of France, under the di&s;graceful expectation, that in proportion as our di&s;&s;atisfaction with the latter was
<PB N="12" REF="037170_0011_100CE0B8F7325F00">
increa&s;ed, our affection for the former would be invigo|rated; to this end, the labours of Porcupine and Fenno were uniformly directed, characters who have met their merited doom, and who have been compelled to take a &s;eat with the ba&s;e&s;t and the meane&s;t of mankind. The next &s;tep was to trample on the &s;pirit of the Con|&s;titution, and to pervert it to their &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es by unwarrantable con&s;tructions, that gave energy to the Federal government at the expence of the individual &s;tates. Con&s;tructions that threatened the liberty of the people, and aimed at the con&s;olidation of the country; both in congre&s;s and the judiciary depart|ment the&s;e, facts have been fully and &s;trongly exempli|fied. Amid&s;t all the&s;e pro&s;pects of Federal republi|can villany, our elections were invaded by bribes and by intrigue; the hone&s;t patriot became an outca&s;t, and the daring enemies of the country, monopolized the &s;uffrages of a <HI>deluded people.</HI> Men who had &s;hared the fir&s;t and highe&s;t honours of their country, (not for|getting your&s;elf) were peddling at the polls, with the mo&s;t rancorous principles, and the mo&s;t degrading fal&s;|hoods; the crew of the &s;hip Ocean was indi&s;crimi|nately murdered to forward the &s;ucce&s;s of the Fe|deral candidates, and to le&s;&s;en the re&s;pectability of the republican cau&s;e; Briti&s;h agents, contractors and fac|tors united in your plans, and enjoyed the plea&s;ing dreams of monarchy, colonization and &s;lavery. The points you had gained by &s;uch ba&s;e and di&s;honorable means gave you a majority in congre&s;s, and &s;addled the country with alien and &s;edition laws, conceived in the &s;pirit of a tran&s;atlantic pattern; laws for which public nece&s;&s;ity never called, but which &s;erved to &s;hade and protect the follies and vices of admini&s;tration; laws that were intended to hold a certain de&s;cription of foreigners in awe, and to re&s;train the liberty of the
<PB N="13" REF="037170_0012_100CE0BA8DF0BDA8">
pre&s;s, the only certain guarantee of public freedom and national happine&s;s. Take away this grand repub|lican e&s;&s;ential, and the elements of &s;ociety are rooted out forever; but all your projects have proved abor|tive, and tho&s;e connected with you are &s;inking into ir|retrievable di&s;grace. Now is the time, agreeable to your favorite author (Machiaeval) to bring the government back to its original principles. Now is the time to wa&s;h away its impurities, and to render it worthy of the American people.</P>
<P>Little was it expected that your party would have made an explo&s;ion &s;o &s;oon. Your &s;eeming unity of action, intimated firmne&s;s, duration and de&s;ign, and perhaps you might have calculated on unchang|able perpetuity, if envy, ambition, and the loaves and fi&s;hes had been out of the que&s;tion; but there is a truth with which every mind mu&s;t be impre&s;&s;ed, it is as palpable and glaring as an age of experience can render it, that vice cannot long be con&s;i&s;tent, and that &s;ooner or later it betrays it&s;elf and expo&s;es its hedious deformities.</P>
<P>You frequently &s;peak of the extreme egoti&s;m of Mr. Adams; but may not the charge be reiterated. In truth, the leading points of your di&s;&s;atisfaction with the Pre&s;ident, will, on accurate &s;elf-examination be di&s;covered to be your own contemptible dome&s;tics, which too often controul and bias you to the mo&s;t di&s;|honorable determinations. What rea&s;onable ground had you to feel offended with the Pre&s;ident; was there none other than a refu&s;al to con&s;ult you as to the pro|priety of &s;ending our envoys to negociate with France? If you had formed a true e&s;timate of your own charac|ter, if you could have looked into the public &s;enti|ment, you would hardly have undertaken a journey to Trenton, under the plau&s;ible pretence of coun&s;el|ling
<PB N="14" REF="037170_0013_100CE0BC4C143D48">
the &s;ecretary at war. The Pre&s;ident was too well acquainted with your demerits and intrigues, to li&s;ten to your advice; he conjectured with a penetration worthy of a &s;tate&s;man, that &s;omething de&s;tructive was meditated in the dark and gloomy rece&s;&s;es of your mind. Did he di&s;tru&s;t his mini&s;ters? it was becau&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions had re&s;olved again&s;t amicable arrange|ments with France, and becau&s;e he cho&s;e rather to comply with the general wi&s;h of his country, than pro|voke an unju&s;tifiable and de&s;tructive warfare with one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful nations of Europe. By taking umbrage at the conduct of the Pre&s;ident, on this occa&s;ion, have you not betrayed an unpardon|able egoti&s;m, a vanity without bound, and a criminal di&s;po&s;ition towards the peace and pro&s;perity of your country?</P>
<P>Who was it that manfully re&s;i&s;ted foreign influence, and thereby invited &s;o much ungenerous per&s;ecution in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of his political life? Again&s;t what great and important character, by who&s;e will the de&s;tiny of nations &s;hould be regulated has the Pre&s;i|dent directed his rancour and re&s;entment? Who was there to find fault with the conduct of Mr. Adams on his neglecting to confirm Mr. Hamilton as command|er in chief after the death of Gen. Wa&s;hington? (Oh! this was a grievous fault! This was a painful &s;troke to the bo&s;om of ambition!) Who has &s;acrificed the intere&s;t of his family to the pro&s;perity of his coun|try? Who has devoted the be&s;t part of his life to the &s;ervice of &s;ociety in coun&s;el and in the field? Who has had the bold in&s;incerity to declare, that in the car|dinal points of public and private rectitude, above all, in pure and di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for his country, that he will not &s;hrink from a compari&s;on with any arrogant pretender to &s;uperior and exclu&s;ive merit? Who con|trouled
<PB N="15" REF="037170_0014_100CE0BE47563068">
the New-York elections, and repre&s;ented him|&s;elf the umpire and leader of the federal party, it was a gentleman by the name of EGO, &s;o notorious in every page of your pamphlet. <HI>Is there any thing more in this, than "a harmle&s;s foible."</HI> In your ar|dent de&s;ire to be appointed commander in chief, &s;ome deductions may be made to prove the re&s;tle&s;s ambition that lurks in your bo&s;om. Have you not been the &s;trenuous advocate of an exten&s;ive miltary e&s;tabli&s;h|ment? Did you not a&s;&s;ert, and erroniou&s;ly imagine, that the temper of the times was &s;uited to commence the exi&s;tence of a &s;tanding army? And was you not convinced from the relative &s;ituation of our country, that no &s;olid advantage would ever be derived from it? What could have been your aim in the propagation of &s;uch &s;entiments, but per&s;onal aggrandizement at the painful expence of public liberty and &s;ocial happi|ne&s;s? Remember, that at this enlightened period of &s;ociety, political hypocri&s;y is liable to detection, and that the di&s;gu&s;ting age of chivalry and va&s;&s;alage is gone. Remember that you are an American citizen, and that every Cae&s;ar has rea&s;on to tremble at the ides of March. Long degraded and in&s;ulted man has re|&s;umed his privileges, and vindicated his rights. An ennobling courage has &s;ucceeded to niggardly &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, and villanous oppre&s;&s;ion has vani&s;hed before the intrepid and irre&s;i&s;table march of mind. Imagine your&s;elf in Turkey and your principles at home. But in America, neither an age or a century can render them acceptable and congenial with the feelings of a magnanimous people. With an ignorant community chains are tolerable, but in a country where &s;cience has beamed, what daring de&s;pot will mea&s;ure the &s;trength of a pea&s;ants arm. Corruption may venture indirectly to a&s;&s;ail the integrity of man, but all its

The cau&s;e of humanity is hourly gaining ground; encrim&s;oned Europe is recovering her rights, and the &s;lumbering Ottoman begins to feel the nobility of his nature: How under &s;uch an atti|tude of human affairs could you have the weakne&s;s to imagine that your ambitious projects could be an&s;wer|ed? The uniform experience of mankind has mea&s;ured the baneful con&s;equences of a &s;tanding army. We all know, that as commander in chief of a &s;trong military force, you would have gained an undue influence in &s;ociety; an influence to which neither your talents or your virtue entitle you; an influence that might have made &s;laves of a few and fawning &s;ycophants of many. But the &s;word and the mytre have lo&s;t their veneration, and the great majority of our country is invulnerable to corruption.</P>
<P>Your reflections on the official conduct of the Pre|&s;ident re&s;pecting our negociations with France, are of a nature too extraordinary to e&s;cape notice. They confirm beyond the power of denial, the opinion I had long &s;ince formed of your political character. They demon&s;trate your inveterate and de&s;tructive ho&s;tility to the government of France. They point out your co|incidence of mind with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, in inter|rupting the cau&s;e of republicani&s;m, and provoking and encouraging a war of extermination; a war that has been carried on by deception, corruption, and terror. What a happy opportunity unfolded it&s;elf for the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of federal indignation, when General Pinck|ney was refu&s;ed to be received by the government of France. The friend of Old England, the patronized refugee, and the apo&s;tate American, united in their re&s;entment again&s;t the glorious &s;truggles of a magna|nimous

people. Here was a lucky moment by un|founded accu&s;ations again&s;t France, to cover the hi|deous deformities of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try. Here was a field opened to &s;econd the de&s;igns of an infamous fac|tion in the very bo&s;om of our country. Here was an unlimited grant for the impre&s;&s;ment and butchery of our &s;eamen; for the plunder of our &s;hips; and the de|ba&s;ement of our national character.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould even be con&s;ented that France treated us ill by a refu&s;al of Pinckney, will not every con&s;i|derate politician reprobate the conduct of the federal party at that critical juncture? Whil&s;t their property was wa&s;ting under their feet, the mo&s;t degrading delu|&s;ion induced them to cultivate the punic friend&s;hip of the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;idious power in Europe. This was no di&s;paragement of national honor&mdash;this was no wound to national independence. Habitual con|ce&s;&s;ion had worn away the delicate &s;en&s;ibility of Ame|rican character. The refu&s;al of Mr. Pinckney by France, has covered a multitude of Briti&s;h &s;ins, and &s;o deep is the attachment of monarchi&s;m rooted in the hearts of many a federali&s;t and anglo-American: So complete their weakne&s;s and madne&s;s, that although cloathed in rags and reduced to beggary by &s;poliations on our commerce, the tune of "God &s;ave the king," is &s;till an ingredient in their morning devotions. Why was it that France would not accept of Mr. Pinckney? Was it becau&s;e &s;he was indi&s;po&s;ed to terms of friend|&s;hip to this country? Or will you not rather &s;ay that the unfeeling tone of your party and of admini&s;tration, opened &s;ome little ground for national re&s;entment? Our prints were loaded with the mo&s;t unfounded ca|lumnies; and a &s;truggle was reprobated the noble&s;t in the annals of time, with which the liberty and happine&s;s of unborn millions is e&s;&s;entially connected.

Your di&s;affection to their cau&s;e commenced, accord|ing to your own confe&s;&s;ion, in the year 1792, when Briti&s;h gold had not yet opened tho&s;e &s;cenes of horror and de&s;olation, of cruelty and blood, that attended the latter &s;tages of their revolution. Your animo&s;ity to|wards them unque&s;tionably may be a&s;cribed to the painful apprehen&s;ion, that a &s;pirit was diffu&s;ing it&s;elf ter|rible to thrones and the deba&s;ing e&s;tabli&s;hments of the earth. This was the &s;pirit you had re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t: but the giant &s;trides of liberty are not to be impeded by the effeminate efforts of a pigmy politician. Under circum&s;tances like the&s;e, would not France have dimi|ni&s;hed her importance by the admi&s;&s;ion of Pinckney, a character who&s;e animo&s;ity to republicani&s;m can only be equalled by your own? Morris had given them a le&s;&s;on of caution, and they too well knew that his mind were compo&s;ed of the &s;ame ho&s;tile and ranca|rous materials.</P>
<P>Mr. Pinckney having been rejected by the French government from the &s;tronge&s;t political rea&s;ons, a commi&s;&s;ion of three was determined on as the only certain road to an amicable adju&s;tment of differen|ces. The republicans cheri&s;hed and &s;upported the plan as e&s;&s;entially connected with the &s;ub&s;tantial in|tere&s;t of the country. But many federali&s;ts, notwiht|&s;tanding what you have advanced, loudly exclaimed again&s;t the mea&s;ure, called for war, and encouraged a more intimate connection with perfidious Britain. You are not excluded from this number: your tongue and your pen were both employed to favor its &s;ucce&s;s. Cannot this fact be illu&s;trated by a circum&s;tance which among other con&s;iderations renders you unworthy of executive confidence? Did you not open your budget to the Bi&s;hop of Autun? Was you not duped, de|luded, and outwitted by an emigrant prie&s;t? When

he had fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the &s;tate of the coun|try; when he had learnt that Great-Britain was an ob|ject of more affectionate regard than France; was it not to be expected that the prime-mini&s;ter of France would feel a degree of coolne&s;s towards our envoys? But it was a coolne&s;s marked with di&s;crimination that protected and honored the character of Mr. Gerry. With what affected pride is the name of Pinckney &s;po|ken of as an efficient member of this commi&s;&s;ion; when, if his conduct on that occa&s;ion is duly e&s;timat|ed, he de&s;erves to be neglected and forgotten. This was a glorious opportunity to invigorate the cau&s;e of federali&s;m, and &s;trengthen the nerves of the Briti&s;h faction. "Tribute was demanded as a preliminary to negociation." But remember that federali&s;m pro|voked the demand, and that a &s;erious dereliction of republican virtues was truly de&s;erving of &s;uch treat|ment.</P>
<P>The capricious conduct of the Pre&s;ident in forming the la&s;t mi&s;&s;ion is certainly very reprehen&s;ible; altho' in the event he acted like a prudent and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate politician, yet many circum&s;tances connected with the emba&s;&s;y, place him in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable and unfa|vourable light. Su&s;pended in the air, by conflicting &s;entiments and di&s;cordant per&s;ua&s;ions, there was a doubtful tendency to heaven or to earth, to negocia|tion or to re&s;i&s;tance. At&egrave; hot from hell, had coun&s;el|led with Federali&s;m, and unkenneled the dogs of war; but the loud voice of the public called for peace, a|mid&s;t the intere&s;ted remon&s;traces of peculating com|mi&s;&s;aries and an indolent and u&s;ele&s;s &s;oldiery. No dangers threatened us at home or from abroad, and the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s di&s;banded a military e&s;tabli&s;hment that annoyed the tranquillity of &s;ociety, and that ine|vitably tended to the degradation of public morals.

The citizen and the &s;oldier had already di&s;&s;olved their connection, and the meane&s;t vices were patro|nized by the pretended friends of liberty.</P>
<P>Is it not a matter of &s;erious regret, that the la&s;t pa|cific effort of the Pre&s;ident has been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s? Is it not an unhappy circum&s;tance, that a friendly intercour&s;e &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed with a na|tion, <HI>whom no treaty, no convention can bind?</HI> Is it not an awful con&s;ideration, that a republic &s;hould be countenanced, which has &s;haken the thrones of kings, and waged a &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t the tyrants and de|&s;troyers of mankind? Is it not criminal in the highe&s;t degree, to cultivate the friend&s;hip of a people, who have loo&s;ened the bonds of moral intercour&s;e, and de&s;poiled the venerable altars of the unknown God? Would it not have been more prudent in the Execu|tive, to have &s;u&s;pended negociation until the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, and the extinction of republican manai&s;m and popular licentiou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>Every genuine friend to this country feels his &s;ecu|rity enlarged by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of republicani&s;m in France. If their revolutionary &s;truggle had been un|&s;ucce&s;sful, monarchy would, perhaps, have a&s;&s;umed a tone inau&s;picious to the future liberty of our coun|try, for the vicious ari&s;tocracy of Europe has many kindred &s;pirits among&s;t us. The innocent and vir|tuous &s;hades of liberty would &s;oon have been invaded by the tyranny of power, and republicani&s;m a unit amid&s;t the empires of the world, might have fallen a victim to irritated de&s;poti&s;m. Another republic is an acqui&s;ition of the highe&s;t moment to the friends of hu|manity. It is planted on a &s;oil that will nouri&s;h its growth. The &s;trokes of tyranny cannot injure it; for eternity has mea&s;ured its duration. The plains of Europe are whitened with the bones of innocent and

guilty millions: the fatherle&s;s and the motherle&s;s are bewailing their lo&s;s in this &s;anguinary war; but yet the purcha&s;e is cheap. Providence has authori&s;ed it, and ages of liberty and happine&s;s are de&s;tined to &s;uc|ceed to centuries of mi&s;ery, depre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>The French republic always felt the warme&s;t affec|tion for the American people. Even amid&s;t the tur|bulent &s;cenes of their revolution, the rights of neu|trality would never have been violated, if nece&s;&s;ity had not compelled them&mdash;if the toryi&s;m of the coun|try had not in&s;ulted them&mdash;and if our political organs had not &s;poken a language unfriendly to their pro&s;pe|rity. The breach, however, is clo&s;ed, and an honor|able treaty has been negociated, contrary to the ad|vice of Mr. Hamilton&mdash;contrary to the wi&s;hes of non-con&s;ulted mini&s;ters&mdash;and, contrary to the &s;entiments of a contemptible anglo-American faction. Debilitated Britain mourns the event; and her tran&s;atlantic agents are pro&s;trate in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>If Mr. Adams had de&s;cended to con&s;ult his mini&s;|ters, what mu&s;t have been our &s;ituation? If <HI>your</HI> in|tru&s;ive advice had been received, what would have been the condition of your country? Embroiled in an unprofitable war, commerce would have been at a &s;tand, and the cau&s;e of liberty on the decline. A &s;tanding &s;oldiery would have gluttonized on the &s;ub|&s;tance of &s;ociety, and in&s;idious vice would have way-laid every ennobling feeling of the brea&s;t.

<P>"Another revolution, another con&s;titution over|thrown," was a cogent rea&s;on again&s;t opening a nego|ciation. Un&s;ettled in their affairs and capricious in their mea&s;ures, it was impo&s;&s;ible to calculate on a

permanent compliance with any convention what&s;o|ever. This is expre&s;sly the language of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and the &s;uperficial pretence that &s;upports the war in Europe. Furni&s;h me an in&s;tance in which the revolutionary government of France has departed from any &s;olemn &s;tipulation with her neighbours; has &s;he violated the laws of nations in that gro&s;s and di&s;honorably way that di&s;tingui&s;hes the cabinet of St. James; has &s;he made power the mea&s;ure of her ju&s;tice, and the umpire of her differences? Has &s;he re|&s;pected the rights of humanity, or offered an in&s;ult without the &s;tronge&s;t provocations? No, ever magna|nimous, the fair and immutable principles of ju&s;|tice, have been the faithful guardians of her conduct. But it was a degrading mi&s;&s;ion, the honor and intere&s;t of the country was at &s;take. How delicate is your &s;en&s;ibility when the Frenchman pricks with a pin, but how callous is your bo&s;om when the Engli&s;hman &s;tabs at the vitals of your country.

<P>In your mind the intere&s;ted inducements to accept a place in our admini&s;tration are few and feeble, and therefore the con&s;oling honour of Pre&s;idential re&s;pect, ought to have been be&s;towed on the mini&s;try at Tren|ton, as an additional compen&s;ation for their political toils. Five thou&s;and dollars is a niggardly &s;alary that mu&s;t inevitably "involve pecuniary &s;acrifice to every <HI>hone&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word "hone&s;t" &s;tands in italics to render it con&s;picuous; a circum&s;tance that leads me to think you have not forgotten your&s;elf.</NOTE> man of pre-eminent talents." Recollect that we live in a republican country, and that a national oeco|nomy is nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence, that we contracted an immen&s;e debt, for which our honour and re&s;ources are pledged, and that the funding &s;y&s;tem has not yet

<P>Independent of pecuniary con&s;iderations, public ingratitude is a &s;erious ground of complaint.

In&s;tead of enjoying the affectionate homage of your country|men, your conduct has been reviled. "A large har|ve&s;t of obliquy has been your &s;hare, and calumnies more dangerous than a two-edged &s;word have been vomited forth again&s;t a fair and unblemi&s;hed reputa|tion.

After a long and pain|ful &s;truggle to benefit their country, and to beguile a whi&s;per from the trumpet of fame, the Pre&s;ident has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them as unde&s;erving of his confidence: and an ungrateful people has loaded them in exile with re|proaches of the blacke&s;t die.

The un&s;ettled &s;ituation of French affairs, and the uncertain pro&s;pect of a general peace, were the two great hinges on which your objections turned. But has not the deep-&s;ighted politician been deceived, and has not a peace been accelerated by the firm de|termination of the Pre&s;ident? If your mi&s;erable arti|fice had been practi&s;ed by furni&s;hing mini&s;ters abroad with &s;ecret in&s;tructions, the &s;incerity of our govern|ment would have been que&s;tioned by other nations, and a jealous vigilance would have retarded the mo&s;t de&s;irable arrangement; France on a di&s;covery would have kept us at a di&s;tance; and an expen&s;ive military e&s;tabli&s;hment would have accumulated the burthens of an already di&s;&s;atisfied people.

Surely the Pre&s;ident cannot be reproached for his conduct on this occa&s;ion; but M'Henry only, the di&s;tingui&s;hed particeps in your foibles and your follies. If his di&s;|cernment had not been blind to the impre&s;&s;ions of truth, how could he con&s;i&s;tently have eulogized you in com|pany with Wa&s;hington, who&s;e name has an alliance with virtue, whil&s;t your's &s;eeks &s;helter under a diame|trically oppo&s;ite principle?

Notwith&s;tand|ing the cen&s;ure that his enemies have mea&s;ured again&s;t him, he exerci&s;ed a prerogative of mercy, and re&s;tor|ed a number of unfortunate victims to their families, their friends, and the world.

The genius of a republic is mildne&s;s; the wheel, the gibbet, and the guillotine, may an&s;wer an advantage under the reign of terror; but with freemen they are objects of horror and dete&s;tation.

The public mind, at the time of re&s;i&s;tance to the tax, was extremely agitated: it was penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of its inju&s;tice and the extent of its oppre&s;&s;ion. The military that was rai&s;ed on that occa&s;ion, was in a tenfold adequate to &s;uppre&s;s the in|&s;urrection.

Could he loo&s;e any re&s;pect as executive magi&s;trate, with di&s;cerning friends, or the warme&s;t enemies, by one of the mo&s;t agreeble features of his admini&s;tration? That he was at variance with him&s;elf as well as with &s;ound policy, is perhaps no more than the vagrant &s;entiment of a &s;anguinary bo&s;om, and a di&s;appointed enemy. Cruel mea&s;ures are oftentimes ruinous, and a government is never better e&s;tabli&s;hed, than when &s;upported by the enlightened will of a country.

of your life were cancelled from your memory. But as &s;uch an opinion is not warranted you are de&s;|tined to appear a hardened offender again&s;t the rules of propriety, and tho&s;e delicate ties that embrace our happine&s;s, and give a ze&s;t to exi&s;tence; altho' an inve|terate enemy to France, have you not proven by your female intrigues, that a &s;pirit of gallantry is one of the &s;tronge&s;t characteri&s;tics of your heart; fortunately for your&s;elf you breathe a northern latitude; in &s;ome warmer climate, where the pa&s;&s;ions are more inflam|ed, your &s;en&s;ual de&s;ires would have levelled you with the bea&s;ts of the field; even the fro&s;ts of America are incapable of cooling your blood, and the eternal &s;nows of Nova Zembla would hardly reduce you to the &s;tandard of common propriety.</P>
<P>What might have been the fate of Reynolds, if you had been commander in chief, and the country in a &s;tate of war, when the fair Maria engro&s;&s;ed your affec|tion? Would you not have followed the foot&s;teps of David, and placed this modern Uriah in the front of battle? Is it not probable that your moral elements have derived their character from a peru&s;al of the lives of Abraham and of Lott, of David and of Solomon, who lived in times when polygamy was countenanced, and when that amiable and valuable &s;ex was le&s;s vene|rated and re&s;pected, than in modern days. But the cu&s;toms of the ancients &s;hall plead you no excu&s;e; the loud voice of Nature ri&s;es up again&s;t you; &s;he repro|bates in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and impre&s;&s;ive language, a monopoly that lowers and deba&s;es the human &s;pe|cies, and that breathes di&s;cord and mi&s;ery, notwith&s;tan|ding a profu&s;ion of every earthly ble&s;&s;ing. Well might you complain of your poverty, when you re&s;igned the office of &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury: that enchanting calyp&s;o, under the extravagance of your attachment had fingered your pur&s;e; &s;he &s;aw into

your weakne&s;s, and knew how to govern you by the &s;tricte&s;t attentions and the mo&s;t beguiling flatteries. Oh! the&s;e were &s;weet and ely&s;ian days, this was a time that awakened all the &s;oft and tender fibres of the heart: the &s;hortened hours danced away amid&s;t the affecting &s;miles of Love and Joy, the little cupids played around, and Sorrow and Melancho|ly de&s;erted the intere&s;ting man&s;ion of tho&s;e conge|nial &s;ouls; it was a picture of bli&s;s and rapture, to which every &s;cene hitherto witne&s;&s;ed was ab&s;olute mockery. It was a &s;cene on which the voluptuous Antoniette would have dwelt with the mo&s;t cordial &s;atisfaction; it was a &s;cene of extacy, the like of which no tongue can tell, and which no eye before had witne&s;|&s;ed. But, alas! plea&s;ures &s;o inten&s;e are of ephemeron duration; a nipping fro&s;t unexpectedly came, and this once happy pair were &s;eparated for ever. The public began to &s;mell the rat, and &s;ee, after a long de|lu&s;ion, that the favorite &s;inking fund was playing a loo&s;ing game. Now public character was at &s;take, and precious confe&s;&s;ions became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ilence the re&s;entment of the people. The Cyprian Godde&s;s remon&s;trated in vain, the unfortunate Maria, was doomed to an expo&s;ure of all others, the mo&s;t poig|nant and afflicting to female &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>From even this &s;lender &s;urvey of your private mo|rality, was it not the mo&s;t arrogant pre&s;umption to challenge an inve&s;tigation. <HI>What becomes of your car|dinal points, if mankind are permitted to &s;peak the truth?</HI> The human mind is a unit, and it may be a&s;|&s;erted with firmne&s;s and with truth, that he who enter|tains no re&s;pect for the relations of private life, cannot be tru&s;ted with &s;afety in a public capacity, if the virtue to re&s;i&s;t temptation in the one ca&s;e is not &s;ufficiently ma&s;culine, there is every rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it will be|tray its effeminacy in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="037170_0029_100CE0E1320AD638">After treating you with all the delicacy that was due to your character and performance; after proving by a &s;ummary of the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony, your attach|ment to monarchy; after developing the vain and am|bitious &s;pirit that impels your actions; after enumerat|ing the circum&s;tances that occa&s;ioned your explo&s;ion; and, after pointing out the immoral features of your private life, I proceed to di&s;cu&s;s the merit of the can|didates for the pre&s;idency.</P>
<P>Having no per&s;onal di&s;&s;atisfaction with Mr. Adams, I &s;hall treat his character with deference and with can|dour. It has long been a received opinion, that he is friendly to monarchi&s;m and hereditary e&s;tabli&s;hments, for the proof and confirmation of which we mu&s;t ap|peal to his writings and confidential conver&s;ations. The &s;pirit of his defence of the con&s;titutions, certainly breathes a tone of mind illy &s;uited to the genius of a republican government; although he has not favored us with an open avowal, yet the indirect intimations of his di&s;po&s;ition leave no room for the &s;malle&s;t doubt. In addition to this, let any ingenuous mind weigh the developement of Tench Coxe, and I defy him to pronounce favorably on the political creed of the Pre|&s;ident. Whether monarchy found him a friend in early life, or whether his &s;oul became tainted by his Eu|ropean vi&s;its, I will not venture to determine, but there is ground to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;plendor and mag|nificence of royalty, have had &s;ome influence on a mind not too well confirmed in a knowledge of the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams has very &s;lender preten&s;ions to con|&s;i&s;tency of character; his fir&s;t &s;peech to both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, is of a truly equivocal nature. Popularity was evidently his aim, he wi&s;hed to monopolize as far as he was capable, the friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the pub|lic. At that particular juncture, it was of &s;ervice to
<PB N="31" REF="037170_0030_100CE0E359B567D8">
his country, as it le&s;&s;oned the bitterne&s;s of party, and the venom of faction, as it opened a field of accom|modation with a nation which de&s;erved more of us than intemperate federali&s;m had been willing to grant. His firmne&s;s on &s;ome occa&s;ions is truly re&s;|pectable and particularly manife&s;ted in the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of Pickering and M'Henry, and in his refu&s;al to con&s;ult a di&s;appointed intruder. At other times again his con|duct is marked with weakne&s;s, improper compliance, and unnece&s;&s;ary conce&s;&s;ions. His under&s;tanding may have &s;u&s;tained &s;ome injury by the a&s;&s;aults of time, but it never could have been very ma&s;culine or brilliant. His writings bear te&s;timony again&s;t his intellect, they are often confu&s;ed and unmeaning, and tainted with the mo&s;t painful vanity; <HI>&s;o much for the Duke of Brain-tree.</HI></P>
<P>The next in order is Mr. Pinckney of whom little can be &s;aid, as he is little known on the theatre of ac|tive public life. You have called him before the pub|lic, and loaded him with the mo&s;t extravagant prai&s;e. If your &s;incerity could not be doubted, he would pa&s;s for one of the brighte&s;t luminaries of our country. His wi&s;dom, his firmne&s;s and his calm deliberation would certainly entitle him to the &s;uffrages of the peo|ple; but the public under&s;tanding cannot be &s;o glar|ingly impo&s;ed on. Some proof of his worth is nece&s;|&s;ary, before he can have a rea&s;onable ground to ex|pect the highe&s;t magi&s;tracy of the country. If con|trary to all expectation, he &s;hould be rai&s;ed to that eminence, what have not the friends of republicani&s;m to apprehend? The reins of government would be held by a private individual in di&s;grace, and the ho|norable office of Pre&s;ident would be filled by an au|tomaton. Principles would be inculcated and di&s;&s;e|minated inau&s;picious to Liberty. The Con&s;titution would receive a wound, and energy would be heaped
<PB N="32" REF="037170_0031_100CE0E6411C83F0">
on energy to cru&s;h the &s;pirit of the people, and to in|demnify ambition in its daring inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>I now come to a character, which mi&s;repre&s;entation cannot &s;tain, and which the breath of calumny has vainly endeavoured to injure. It is the worthy and venerable Jeffer&s;on, who has walked with dignity in every public and private calling, and whom every hone&s;t man in Eu|rope and America will love and e&s;teem; the man who&s;e mind is illumed with &s;cience, and who&s;e heart is replete with good; the man who has &s;tood firm and un&s;haken amid&s;t the venality of courts, and the temptations of power; the man who endited the Declaration of In|dependence, and who under every &s;acrifice grappled his heart to the freedom of his country. Amid&s;t all the little revolutions and commotions that have occurred under our government, has not the conduct of Jef|fer&s;on been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t exemplary wi&s;dom and virtue? the love he bore his country out-weighed every private con&s;ideration;&mdash; his magnanimous &s;oul would not &s;toop to the degrading mea&s;ures of his cotemporaries in office. An enemy to &s;ycophants, and deaf to flatteries, he merits the confidence of the American. Deep in re|&s;earch, and cool in deliberation, a precipitate &s;acrifice of the public pro&s;perity can never be apprehended. Wa&s;hington loved him and knew his worth; he felt a &s;ecurity in his advice, that gave a firmne&s;s and dignity to the whole of his admini&s;tration. If it is of importance to a country that the national character &s;hould be re&s;pected, let us choo&s;e a man at the head of public affairs; who&s;e virtue and who&s;e know|ledge is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, and who by his un&s;ullied cour&s;e of life, and his patriotic firmne&s;s, has proved that no party con&s;iderations can draw him from the duties of his &s;tation and the intere&s;t of his country; could it have been imagined that &s;o many mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel would have ri&s;en up again&s;t him, and that the &s;anctity of the pulpit would have been violated by the tongue of &s;lander, and the bittere&s;t anathemas? could it have been imagined that the duties of religion would have been neglected; that the altar of God would have been de&s;erted, for the propagation of the ba&s;e&s;t and meane&s;t calumnies? But there are other motives that have given ri&s;e to the di&s;gu&s;ting clamor of the&s;e fa|natic prie&s;ts: it is not the good of their country, and the cau&s;e of mo|rals, that has induced them to de&s;ert the duties of their &s;tation; they are looking forward to tho&s;e <HI>happy days,</HI> when a meritricious union &s;hall be formed between church and &s;tate; when public councils &s;hall be controuled by a clerical nod, and when the exactions of the titheman &s;hall grind the face of the poor.</P>
