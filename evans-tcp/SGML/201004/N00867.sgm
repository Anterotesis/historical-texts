<P N="1">1 <HI>Rule.</HI> YOU mu&s;t throughly acquaint your &s;elves with the <HI>Rule</HI> &amp; <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> that <HI>Religion &s;teers by.</HI> The Word is a believers <HI>Com|pa&s;s,</HI> a believers <HI>Rule,</HI> Gal. 6.16. <HI>As many as walk according to this Rule, &amp;c.</HI> A believer walks by Rule, and by this Rule, <HI>The word of God.</HI> You can never throughly manage the great bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, except you do throughly know, &amp; often eye your <HI>Rule,</HI> and put the <HI>Rule</HI> to your work. The <HI>Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> &amp; pre&s;cribes you <HI>Rules</HI> for your whole man, &amp; for the right behaving of your &s;elves in every part of your Conver&s;ation; Oh hide the word in your hearts; lay up the <HI>Rules</HI> you are to work by, the <HI>Rules</HI> that you are to give by, the <HI>Rules</HI> that you are to &s;peak by, to hear by; be &s;ure there be no part of your Conver&s;ation but that
<PB N="4" REF="001044_0003_0FAEEB145C7FAB68">
you have &s;ome <HI>Rules</HI> that you &s;et to your &s;elves about it. How can you carry your &s;elves <HI>Re|ligiou&s;ly</HI> in your Relations, unle&s;s you do Con|&s;cientiou&s;&s;ly ob&s;erve the <HI>Rules</HI> you are to carry your &s;elves by?

<P N="2">2. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t have the whole <HI>Lump</HI> of the heart leavened &amp; &s;ea&s;oned with <HI>Religion.</HI> Mat. 13.33. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman hid, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> is this <HI>Leaven,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is this <HI>Lump,</HI> in which this <HI>Leaven</HI> is hid; now when the whole Lump is throughly Leavened, there will be &s;uch a &s;uita|blene&s;s betwixt the heart and the work, that <HI>Religion</HI> will become a plea&s;ure. A true Chri&s;ti|an hath the Law of God in his heart; a Tran&s;|cript of the Word in his Soul; now where the Law of Religion is in the heart, there will be a love of delight in, &amp; pro&s;perity to the work of Religion. P&s;al. 40.8. <HI>I delight to do thy Will, thy Law is within my heart.</HI> Where Religion hath taken deep root in the heart, the concerns of Chri&s;t will become its natural care, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.20. now that which is natural is delightful; and when a man loves his work, he will be much in it. Again, that which is natural is con&s;tant, &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="001044_0004_0FAEEB178A469998">
that when the heart is naturalized &amp; habituated to <HI>Religion,</HI> the man will con&s;tantly follow it. To a heart throughly Sanctified, Religion is the ve|ry Element it lives in, <HI>when the heart is renewed and made &s;piritual, 't will naturally mind the things of the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t have the&s;e <HI>Six Principles</HI> in|wrought and deeply engraven in your Souls.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That Religion is the very end of your being, that you were made and maintained for.</HI> This is the end and u&s;e of all your powers and faculties, that you may &s;erve and glorify the God that made you; He made you for him&s;elf, Prov. 16.4. <HI>For His plea&s;ure you are &amp; were Created. Rev.</HI> 4.11. Oh man, look upon thy &s;elf; think, whence thou art, what a little while &s;ince thou wa&s;t not, how came&s;t thou to be? Hath not the hand of God framed thee? Think with thy &s;elf, wherefore &s;erve all the&s;e powers and faculties? To what end were they given me? What to Eat, and Drink, &amp; Sleep, and Sport? If I had been a Bruit, I could have done this; wherefore have I rea&s;on above the re&s;t of the Creatures, but that I &s;hould an&s;wer the Law of my Creation, and the end of my being, and know my Makers end, and <HI>do His plea&s;ure?</HI> Better I had never been Born, than not to an&s;wer my end; better I had been a Bruit than a Man, unle&s;s I Glorify God with
<PB N="6" REF="001044_0005_0FAEEB18A2AC2CC8">
my under&s;tanding, and employ my powers &amp; faculties in his &s;ervice. Oh let the&s;e thoughts live daily upon your hearts. Fix it upon your Souls that you are of no u&s;e nor worth in the world, except you &s;erve your Makers ends.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That look as you do manage the great bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, &s;o you are made or marr'd to all Eternity.</HI> Settle it upon your hearts, that if this bu&s;ine&s;s mi&s;carry, you are undone for evermore; You may mi&s;carry in any other bu|&s;ine&s;s, and yet do well enough at la&s;t, but if you don't go through with the bu&s;ine&s;s of Re|ligion, you are undone men. Believe it, <HI>Reli|gion is no trifling matter;</HI> if thou be carele&s;s and idle, and remi&s;s here, thou art a <HI>Damned man.</HI> The rea&s;on why Religion is minded with &s;o little care, is, becau&s;e men do not con&s;ider the Con&s;equence of Religion. <HI>Can you Dy? Can you Burn?</HI> If not, take heed of trifling in Re|ligion, and of &s;elling Heaven for want of a little pains taking. Oh, wherever you be un&s;erious, be &s;ure you be &s;erious and in earne&s;t in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of Religion. And that you may be &s;o, let this ever dwell upon hearts, that halving and trifling will undoe all.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That nothing is well done, except it be Religiou&s;ly done.</HI> Do all in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us. Col. 3.17. <HI>Do all to the glory of God.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31. Remember the Rules of <HI>Religion</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001044_0006_0FAEEB19ECED9258">
don't only reach your Praying, Hearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but your Eating, Drinking, Trading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Count that hour lo&s;t, that is not &s;pent Reli|giou&s;ly; Your lying down, and ri&s;ing up, mu&s;t be managed Religiou&s;ly, or el&s;e they are not well managed; and you mu&s;t impo&s;e it up|on your &s;elves, to be &s;erving God, not only on your knees, but in your Shops, in the Field, at your Tables, in your Journeys, <HI>that God may be Glorified by you in all things.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That the trade of Religion, of all others, yields the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure, and &s;ure&s;t gain.</HI> A Religious Holy life is a Spiritual trading. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.16. Now there is no trade to this. A Chri&s;tian is a <HI>Merchant</HI> that deals for no &s;mall matters, but for <HI>goodly Pearls. Mat.</HI> 13.5. A believer trades for Grace and Glory. Oh how Glorious is the prize, and how excellent and unvaluable is the income of Religion! <HI>Wi&s;dom is more precious than Rubies; all the things thou can&s;t de&s;ire are not to be compared to her, the mer|chandi&s;e of it is better then the merchandi&s;e of &s;ilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold.</HI> Read <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.11. &amp; <HI>Prov.</HI> 3. to 19. Every man will be dealing in that Commodity that yields great profit. The rea&s;on why men have &s;o little heart for Religion is, becau&s;e they have &s;ecretly an opinion that there is little to be got by it. They &s;ay in their hearts <HI>it is vain
<PB N="8" REF="001044_0007_0FAEEB1B1449E0D0">
to &s;erve God,</HI> Mal. 3.14. and, <HI>what profit &s;hall we have if we pray unto Him?</HI> Job 21.15. But when a man ta&s;ts the plea&s;ure, &amp; finds the gain of Religion, then he will &s;et to it to pur|po&s;e, and like the wi&s;e merchant, employ all his &s;tock here. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.44. As ever then you would wake Religion your bu&s;ine&s;s, get your hearts throughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the advantage and profit, the plea&s;ure &amp; the gain, that comes in by Religion. There are two great pillars upon which Religion &s;tands the one is, <HI>A belief that God is:</HI> and the other is, <HI>That he is a re|warder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> Heb. 11.6. Then let this dwell upon your hearts, that you cannot better your &s;tate, nor promote your happine&s;s any way in all the world &s;o much as by Religion, no plea&s;ure nor profit to that of Religion: <HI>Riches and Honour are with her, all her wayes are plea&s;antne&s;s; Shee is a tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her,</HI> Prov. 3.17.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>That your time is &s;hort, your work great, and mu&s;t be done now or never.</HI> Remember with Chri&s;t, that now you have a day to work in, and it but a <HI>Day,</HI> and the <HI>Night</HI> is ha&s;tning upon you when there is no work to be done; no more <HI>Praying,</HI> no more <HI>Hearing</HI> &amp;c. Let it ever dwell upon you, <HI>that there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the Grave
<PB N="9" REF="001044_0008_0FAEEB1BD334FA18">
whither thou art going.</HI> And this will put you upon doing the work of <HI>Religion</HI> with all your might: Be convinced of the weight of your work, remember of what dreadful Con|&s;equence it is, your Salvation is at &s;take, and therefore you mu&s;t <HI>work it out with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly. <HI>That except you make it your bu&s;ine&s;s, all your Religion is in vain.</HI> While you halt &amp; halve it in <HI>Religion,</HI> you come but half way to heaven. Settle it upon your hearts, that except you are throughout Religious, you are Religious to no purpo&s;e. Be &s;ure you &s;hall never come to heaven, except you &s;eek it in Gods order. Mat. 6.33. <HI>Seek fir&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. It were not &s;uitable to the wi&s;dom of God, &s;o to un|dervalue His Chri&s;t and Glory, as to throw them away upon tho&s;e that account other mat|ters better worth their pains and care.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t have <HI>the Love of God,</HI> &amp; <HI>Religion,</HI> lying next your hearts; Love is a bu&s;y Grace, 1 The&s;. 1.3. <HI>Your labour of love.</HI> Love will con&s;train you, and put you upon a willing and diligent keeping Gods Command|ments. Get your hearts in love with the Laws and Ways of God; who more bu&s;y then <HI>David,</HI> thinking and talking of God and his wayes all the day, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his Love to them. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.97.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="10" REF="001044_0009_0FAEEB1CA511C6D0">5. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t beware of taking too much <HI>of the world</HI> into your hands. If <HI>Marcha</HI> will trouble her &s;elf about <HI>many things,</HI> the <HI>One thing needful will be neglected.</HI> Luk 10.41, 42. You mu&s;t <HI>Buy,</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> and <HI>Marry,</HI> and <HI>Weep,</HI> &amp; <HI>Care</HI> for the&s;e things, as if you did it not; not laying too much &s;tre&s;s upon the&s;e things, not engaging too eagerly in &s;eeking after them, or el&s;e you will neglect the better things; and learn to <HI>Pray,</HI> and <HI>Read,</HI> and <HI>Hear,</HI> as if you did it not. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.30. Tis true that the work <HI>of your Callings</HI> is part of your bu&s;ine&s;s for hea|ven; but then you mu&s;t be &s;ure to keep your affairs at command, as that you may have &s;o much room for <HI>Prayer, Meditation</HI> and <HI>Self-re|flection</HI> as may &s;ea&s;on your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s with Religion, and &s;anctify it to you, that it may become a help and not a &s;nare.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t always work as under your <HI>Ma&s;ters Eye.</HI> When the Ma&s;ters eye is known to look on, there is as much work done in an hour, as many times is done in two when the fence of his over&s;ight doth not quicken the workman. P&s;al. 16.8. <HI>I have &s;et the Lord al|ways before me.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t ever carry your eye upon your <HI>Mark.</HI> So did <HI>Paul; I pre&s;s towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t.</HI> The Mark that a believer aims at, is,
<PB N="11" REF="001044_0010_0FAEEB1D639C7480">
<HI>Gods Glory,</HI> and his own, that God may be Glorified in him, and he with God. This glo|rious prize will animate you to your work, &amp; &s;wallow up the &s;ence of labour and difficulty, and make you <HI>for the joy &s;et before you, endure the Cro&s;s and de&s;pi&s;e the Shame.</HI> Heb. 12.2. <HI>Paul</HI> carried the Crown incorruptible in his eye, and that made him with patience invincible to run, and fight, and keep under his body. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25, &mdash; Keep Heaven in &s;ight, and your work will go on with plea&s;ure, and all your difficulties will &s;eem light and ea&s;ie.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t at the entrance of every action remember the Rules that you are to <HI>act by.</HI> El&s;e in vain, do you receive and lay up Rules, if when occa&s;ion is, you do not apply them to the particular ca&s;e. As ever you de|&s;ire to make any thing of your Religion, re|member when you come to your <HI>Tables,</HI> the Rules you are <HI>to eat by,</HI> when you come to <HI>your Callings,</HI> make <HI>Vi&s;its, Read,</HI> or <HI>hear the Word,</HI> be &s;ure you think on the Rules that you are to <HI>work by, di&s;cour&s;e by, read by, hear by.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Rule.</HI> Be &s;ure every morning to &s;et out to a <HI>right point of the Compa&s;s.</HI> Never ri&s;e from your Beds but with &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e, <HI>I will &s;et forth this day in the Name of God;</HI> Re|ligion <HI>&s;hall be my bu&s;ine&s;s this day; I will &s;urely

&s;pend this day for Eternity. David</HI> would begin with God, P&s;al. 139.15. <HI>When I awake I am still with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Rule.</HI> Let the <HI>pre&s;ent days practice</HI> be &s;till the mending of the <HI>pa&s;t dayes errors.</HI> El&s;e to what purpo&s;e are <HI>your Self-examinations?</HI> In vain do we <HI>think on our ways, except we turn our feet into Gods Te&s;timonies.</HI> P&s;al. 119.59.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Rule.</HI> You mu&s;t <HI>Deny your &s;elves,</HI> and keep under <HI>your Carnal Lu&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Affections.</HI> If you &s;uffer <HI>your Lu&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Carnal Affections</HI> to command you, to be &s;ure they will find you work enough you will then have little room and little lea&s;ure: but the&s;e will be <HI>all the day long</HI> calling upon you to gratify. Your Lu&s;ts will find you work <HI>Night</HI> and <HI>Day,</HI> and <HI>your Employment</HI> will be to make provi&s;ion for the Fle&s;h: Get the&s;e therefore under, or the <HI>bu|&s;ine&s;s of Religion</HI> can never go on.</P>

Let &s;omewhat be mended <HI>every day;</HI> forget not that holy Coun&s;el to meditate <HI>every Evening,</HI> that &s;eeing thy days are numbred, there is <HI>one more</HI> of thy number &s;pent, and thou art now nearer to thy end <HI>by a Day.</HI></P>

that you would not dare to <HI>Dy</HI> in. How know you but your <HI>next &s;tep</HI> may be into the Grave? Would you be found in your <HI>Sins?</HI> How do you know but that Death may meet you at the <HI>next turning?</HI> And Oh how unwelcome a meet|ing will it be, if you be found by it laden with your Lu&s;ts? Would you have Death to find you out of your <HI>Harne&s;s?</HI> Would you meet your Enemy without a <HI>Weapon?</HI> Or be found by him in a carele&s;s, &s;ecure and &s;leepy po&s;ture? If not, how dare you live at &s;uch a rate? Are you <HI>at an agreement with death?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Be always about your <HI>Fathers bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> your Lord &amp; Ma&s;ters work, that Death may not be able to find you <HI>doing evil,</HI> or <HI>doing nothing. Ble&s;&s;ed is that Servant whom his Lord when He cometh &s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI> Remember in what you undertake that <HI>Death</HI> may overtake you before you have ended; therefore &s;ee you go about no|thing without <HI>Gods warrant;</HI> carry this with you, and you need not fear Deaths &s;urprizal; Wo unto you if Death find you with your <HI>work to do:</HI> This was <HI>Pauls</HI> joy, <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Get <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> to be your Friend, le&s;t that &s;hould &s;et <HI>Death</HI> upon you to worry you, when you come to dy. Beware you mi&s;take not the <HI>Slumber of Con&s;cience</HI> for a &s;ettled <HI>Peace; Death</HI> will rouze the <HI>Sleeping Lyon,</HI> &amp; then, Oh fear|ful work that he will make! If you be wi&s;e, get &amp; keep a <HI>Good Con&s;cience;</HI> carry it to the <HI>Foun|tain

<P N="9">9. Remember your <HI>Sick-bed Re&s;olutions,</HI> and &s;et a mark upon tho&s;e things that did mo&s;t trou|ble you, &amp; make Death look mo&s;t gha&s;tly.

<P N="10">10. <HI>Keep no long Reckonings;</HI> but let Con&s;ci|ence bring you in the Accounts <HI>every day</HI> before you &s;leep. Keep a <HI>day-Book</HI> in your own hearts; &s;peedily make up any Controver&s;ies that may fall out betwixt God and your Souls; it will be &s;ad to find old things to reckon for when you come to Die. Study to keep all clear &amp; even daily within; Daily <HI>Self-Examination</HI> will make you live holily, and die comfortably; but if

you let things run long you will be all at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Look often into your Coffens,</HI> &amp; behold your bones and du&s;t; as &s;hortly others &s;hall, when turned out of your Graves; be not &s;trangers to the thoughts of Death; expect it, <HI>wait all the days of your appointed time when your change &s;hall come;</HI> familiarize the <HI>thoughts of death</HI> to your &s;elves, that you may be alwayes &s;afe. You mu&s;t never be &s;ecure: You mu&s;t pray, and &s;et a watch, &amp; be always upon your guard; walk e|very day &s;ome &s;erious turns with <HI>Death.</HI> Let it never come unlookt for; <HI>Con&s;ider your latter end,</HI> learn to <HI>number your dayes;</HI> God doth number them why &s;hould not you&punc; If <HI>the man of the hou&s;e had known what hour of the night the Thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have &s;uffered his hou&s;e to be broken up;</HI> but it is too late to think of it when the hou&s;e is ri|fled. Be not of them that <HI>put far off the evil day;</HI> it is the remembrance of of Death puts life in|to our Prayers, &amp; into all our motions; he that remembers not his end, remembers nothing as he &s;hould.</P>
<P N="12">12. Above all, <HI>Speed to the City of Refuge.</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>Get</HI> into it, clo&s;e &s;oundly with Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Oh dreadful work that Death makes with tho&s;e that are not found in <HI>Him;</HI> it tears the Body and Soul a&s;under, it drags the Soul to Hell, and locks up the Du&s;t in Pri&s;on until the terrible Judgment, it puts an end to all comforts, and enters the &s;inner upon unchargeable mi&s;ery, and delivers over the Pri&s;oners to the Tor|mentors.
<PB N="8" REF="001044_0019_0FAEEB271194F618">
But if you give up your &s;elves entire|ly beforehand to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and accept him by believing on his own terms, this will &s;ecure you in him, then the danger of this is over. Look to this what ever you neglect, <HI>once in Chri&s;t and you have the Victory;</HI> you may &s;end a chal|lenge to Death, &amp; with <HI>Paul</HI> triump'r, and go with &s;houts of Joy, and palms of Victory, and garments of Salvation, to encounter with, or rather make &s;poil of your already conquered Enemy. Secondly, <HI>Keep</HI> you in it. When you have received <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, you mu&s;t walk in Him:</HI> wander from Him &amp; you betray your &s;afety. Oh look to it, that Death find you not venturing out of your refuge by loo&s;e walking.</P>
<P N="13">13 Lay in a <HI>&s;tock of Promi&s;es</HI> now in time a|gain&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of Death.
