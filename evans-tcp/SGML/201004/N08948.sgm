<HEAD>THE SPEECH Of <HI>Th-m-s P-wn-ll,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Late G-v-rn-r of this Province, in the H&mdash;&s;e of C&mdash;m&mdash;ns, in Favor of <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE C&mdash;tee having gone through the examination of the facts contained in the North-American papers, and the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the opinions and re|&s;olutions formed and originated in another place, and &s;ent to us for our concurrence, have taken up the&s;e re&s;olutions with an addre&s;s that accom|panies them, as the only proper mea&s;ures for P&mdash;t to adopt on this important occa&s;ion, at this very dangerous and perilous cri&s;is. 'Tis not more &s;trange that this &s;hould be thought any remedy at all for this dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, than that it &s;hould be taken up <HI>as the only remedy</HI>&mdash;however, &s;uch as it is, this is the only matter pro|po&s;ed for our deliberation, and therefore the only matter into the con&s;ideration of which I &s;hall enter. As this appears to me in two different lights, I &s;hall beg to view it <HI>under two different con&s;iderations.</HI>&mdash;In the fir&s;t view I con&s;ider the H&mdash;&s;e as acting in its juri&s;diction of grand inque&s;t of the nation, <HI>as having made an inqui&s;ition</HI> formed into re&s;olutions, and as having, by their addre&s;s, <HI>made a pre&s;entment</HI> of the crimes and mi&s;demeanors found in the &s;aid re&s;olutions. In the &s;econd place I &s;hall con&s;ider this mea&s;ure, now taken by Mini&s;try, <HI>as a political mea&s;ure,</HI> under the parti|cular ca&s;e laid before us for the inforcing of revenue laws. When, Sir, I con&s;ider this h&mdash;&s;e as acting in its juri&s;diction of grand inque&s;t of the nation, I mu&s;t beg leave to mark, to every individual who hears me, the e&s;&s;ential difference that there is be|tween coming to an opinion upon a political mea&s;ure, and the giving a judgment which becomes their <HI>verdict.</HI> In the fir&s;t ca&s;e. I do not wonder that gentlemen &s;hould defer their opinions to the opinions of per&s;ons, who, from their &s;ituation and employment, mu&s;t be better informed of the nece&s;&s;ity, the propriety, and effect of any political mea&s;ure, as they alone can be fully informed of the circum&s;tances which call for it&mdash;of the means, connected with collateral events, which are really practicable&mdash;and as they are more e&s;pecially re&s;pon&s;ible for the con&s;equences of &s;uch mea&s;ures which they propo&s;e or undertake&mdash;I &s;ay, Sir, it is natural, for various rea|&s;ons, that there &s;hould always be a majority of gentlemen who are di&s;po&s;ed to make this deference of their opinions; but, Sir, when they do con&s;ider that they are &s;itting
<PB N="2" REF="011423_0002_0F832C78DB28ED38">
in judgment, and are to give their verdict, there is not a &s;ingle individual who hears me, that can think it con&s;i&s;tent, either with his honour or his con&s;cience, to make that deference of his judgment, when that judgment is to form the verdict: I there|fore, Sir, call upon and appeal to the con&s;cience of every m&mdash;r of this h&mdash;&s;e to ex|amine, with the &s;ame preci&s;ion and ju&s;tice, <HI>the facts</HI> &s;tated in the&s;e re&s;olutions, before they give their judgment on them <HI>as crimes,</HI> as they would do if they were members of a grand jury: and it is in this view that I beg to &s;ubmit my opinion upon the re&s;olves now offered to the h&mdash;&s;e. Upon the whole, I do venture to pronounce, that however illegal and uncon&s;titutional we may &s;uppo&s;e <HI>the proceedings</HI> of the h&mdash;&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay to have been; yet, Sir, the&s;e re&s;olutions, if they charge them not only with crimes and mi&s;demeanors that they have <HI>not com|mitted,</HI> but with tho&s;e which they have carefully and cautiou&s;ly <HI>avoided</HI> to commit, there would be in <HI>our proceedings</HI> a &s;pirit and temper hardly to be reconciled to ju&s;tice. If there be any thing in the&s;e re&s;olves, now propo&s;ed to you, charging the council and civil magi&s;trates of that province with having neglected to execute and perform tho&s;e duties, which, as a tru&s;t, they are by their charter required to do, and if tho&s;e charges &s;hould lead to any thing that is to affect that charter&mdash;while tho&s;e charges are neither rightly under&s;tood, nor &s;ufficiently grounded&mdash;&s;urely we ought not preci|pitately to come into the&s;e re&s;olutions, without having thoroughly examined the ca&s;e and circum&s;tances under which the&s;e people were to act, and al&s;o the &s;teps and conduct which they, to the be&s;t of their judgment, thought proper to take, in order <HI>to re&s;tore and keep peace.</HI> However illegal and uncon&s;titutional the proceedings of the town-meeting of Bo&s;ton may have been&mdash;whatever tendencies they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had&mdash;however dangerous the meeting of convention may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, and whatever intention may be imputed to it&mdash;we &s;urely &s;hould not ha&s;tily, and without &s;ufficient examination of the &s;tate of the evidence, charge them with the u&s;urpation of the powers of government, and with intentions of &s;etting up a new and uncon&s;titutional authority independent of the crown of Great-Britain. It is therefore, Sir, for this purpo&s;e I mu&s;t intreat the indulgence and patience of the h&mdash;&s;e to permit me to examine the&s;e &s;everal charges by the nature of the evi|dence upon which they are founded.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the charge which is made in the fir&s;t and &s;econd re&s;olutions again&s;t the proceedings of the hou&s;e of r&mdash; in January and February 1768, I do, Sir, acknowledge that there are many things which I would not dare to ju&s;tify in this h&mdash;. I do acknowledge, Sir, that wherever they call into que&s;tion the power and authority of the King, Lords &amp; Commons in parliament a&s;&s;embled, to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of Am&mdash; &s;ubjects of the crown of Great Britain in all ca&s;es what&s;oever&mdash;Whether this be done by re&s;olutions, or by writing of letters, they are unwarrantable and dangerous, are illegal and and uncon&s;titutional proceedings, and derogatory of the right of the crown and parrliament of Great Britain. But when there is any particular fact charged in aggravation of the&s;e proceedings&punc; when the h&mdash; of r&mdash; is charged with in|tent <HI>to create unlawful combinations</HI> again&s;t the laws and &s;tatutes of Great Britain, <HI>upon the fact</HI> that they came to a re&s;olution, by letters, to de&s;ire the other hou&s;es of
<PB N="3" REF="011423_0003_0F832C799BF63BD0">
a&s;&s;embly on the continent, <HI>to join with them</HI> in this denial of the authority of parlia|ment&mdash;<HI>that fact</HI> ought to be very carefully &s;tated, and very &s;urely founded in the evidence that is given of it.&mdash;Now, let me &s;tate how this fact does actually &s;tand, and then compare it as it is &s;tated in the &s;econd re&s;olution. The h&mdash; of r&mdash;, in January 1768, in a dabate upon the <Q>expediency of writing to the a&s;&s;emblies of the other colonies on the continent, with re&s;pect to the importance of their <HI>joining</HI> with them, &amp;c,</Q> put a que&s;tion upon their propo&s;ition of writing letters, de&s;iring tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies <HI>to join</HI> with them&mdash;which pa&s;&s;ed <HI>in the negative</HI>&mdash;and was &s;o negatived for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e containing <HI>that very propo&s;ition of joining,</HI> the h&mdash; thought exceptions might be taken to it, as having a tendency to the forming combinations, and might be <HI>con&s;idered at home as the appointing another congre&s;s.</HI> Be|&s;ides what I know from my own informations of this matter, I am founded in &s;aying that this was the very rea&s;on why this motion received its negative, becau&s;e Governor Bernard, in his letter of the 30th of January 1768, gives this very account of it. But although, Sir, the hou&s;e of r&mdash;s thought that that this mode of proceeding, to de&s;ire the other a&s;&s;emblies <HI>to join with them,</HI> was neither prudent nor ju&s;tifiable, yet they did not think that there could be any exception taken to their acquainting the other hou&s;es of r&mdash;s on the continent with <Q>the mea&s;ures they had taken <HI>with regard to the difficulties ari&s;ing</HI> from the acts of parliament for levying duties and taxes on the American colonies.</Q> The fir&s;t que&s;tion received its negative, becau&s;e it was liable to the very imputation you now charge them with; and the &s;econd cautiou&s;ly avoids every &s;tep, and even expre&s;&s;ion, that might be liable to &s;uch imputations, and yet you do charge them therewith. You charge them fir&s;t with unlawful combinations, and &s;upport that charge by evidence of a fact which never did exi&s;t, by reciting the exceptionable words of a motion which received its nega|tive becau&s;e it had tho&s;e exceptionable words in it: and notwith&s;tanding the gentle|men who fir&s;t brought forward this charge have conde&s;cended to amend the error, as to date, yet I perceive they think &s;till that the re&s;olve that gave occa&s;ion to the circular letter &s;till &s;tands in the <HI>affirmative</HI> upon the Journals of the hou&s;e for January. They are led into this error by their ignorance of the proceedings of that hou&s;e, when it proceeds to <HI>recon&s;ider a negative, &s;o as to leave the original &s;ubject at large</HI>&mdash;yet they might have been &s;et right (fir&s;t) by Governor Bernard's letter of the 30th of January, which acquaints the Secretary of State that the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tood negatived in the month of <HI>January:</HI> and (next) by the Speaker's letter, which tells the &s;ame Mini&s;ter, that <Q>the re&s;olution which gave birth to the circular letter took place on the 4th of February:</Q> but I &s;ee it is determined that we mu&s;t cen&s;ure a re&s;olve which never exi&s;ted. Now, Sir, however you may be founded in the other parts of the charge brought forward in the two fir&s;t re&s;olutions&mdash;can any man give his judgment upon inque&s;t that this charge is founded.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the charges brought again&s;t the council and civil magi&s;trates in the third and fourth re&s;olutions&mdash;I beg leave, fir&s;t, to examine the nature and cir|cum&s;tances of the riots and tumults &s;aid <HI>to have continued for &s;ome time</HI> in the town of Bo&s;ton. Whatever may have been the general di&s;contents of the people of that town at the revenue laws&mdash;whatever may have been their general di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the
<PB N="4" REF="011423_0004_0F832C7BA6429DE0">
commi&s;&s;ioners of the revenue&mdash;whatever may have been their murmurings&mdash;what|ever their complaints, either in &s;peaking or writing&mdash;whatever may have been the illegal conduct of &s;ome audacious &s;mugglers, in open defiance of law and civil autho|rity&mdash;I find, in the evidence, but two tran&s;actions that can be con&s;trued into riot and tumult. The fir&s;t was on the 18th of March; the &s;econd on the 10th of June; that on the 18th of March, was nothing more than a mere <HI>proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of a po&s;t-chariot or two, and &s;ome &s;ingle hor&s;e chai&s;es, with a mob of boys, and idle people at their heels, <HI>by way of ovation or triumph</HI> over the &s;tamp-act, on the anniver&s;ary of its repeal. There was, Sir, a proce&s;&s;ion of the very &s;ame nature in London upon the anniver|&s;ary of the failure of the exci&s;e bill; and yet, Sir, the civil magi&s;trates of the city of London never had any &s;uch &s;evere charge brought again&s;t them for not putting a &s;top thereto. On the contrary, that great mini&s;ter Sir Robert Walpole &s;aid, he &s;hould be a&s;hamed not to di&s;tingui&s;h oppo&s;ition to the laws from oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;ter, and &s;hould think him&s;elf a very bad man to confound what was harmle&s;s in the one ca&s;e with what was dangerous and criminal in the other. As to the riot on the 10th of June, it was undoubtedly not only illegal, but of a dangerous nature&mdash;yet, Sir, it was &s;udden, unpremeditated, and temporary.&mdash;It began and ended within a few hours, on the &s;ame evening&mdash;The effect was over before any preventive mea&s;ures could have been taken to &s;uppre&s;s it; nor was any civil ma|gi&s;trate applied to at the time; nor has any violence, riot or tumult happened &s;ince. The council (which is all that their authority could do) took the occa&s;ion to expre&s;s their abhorrence of all &s;uch riots and tumults, and to advi&s;e the governor to direct the attorney-general to pro&s;ecute the offenders; and notwith&s;tanding government has been informed, on this particular occa&s;ion, <HI>that nothing but the exertion of military power could prevent an open revolt of the town of Bo&s;ton, which might probably &s;pread throughout the provinces:</HI> yet, Sir, it is plain by the letter of Governor Bernard to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the revenue, written by the unanimous de&s;ire of the council, that &s;o far from expecting, <HI>at that time,</HI> any further violences, there was no ground to expect any violences at all.&mdash;Which <HI>unanimous opinion of the governor and council</HI> hath been ju&s;tified by the event; becau&s;e no &s;uch riots or violences have &s;ince happened; &s;o that the whole of the&s;e riots and tumults, &s;aid to have continued for &s;ome time, are reduced to the &s;udden unpremeditated ri&s;ing of a mob for two or three hours.&mdash;Upon this &s;tate of the facts&mdash;is there any ground to bring forward a charge of cen&s;ure again&s;t the town in general, or upon the council or civil magi&s;tracy of that province, which can lead to any thing that may affect their charter! If the re&s;olution leads to that&mdash;it is not founded&mdash;if it does not&mdash;it is irritating &amp; provoking, &amp; means nothing.</P>
<P>I take no notice of the fifth re&s;olution, as it contains only the approbation of a mea|&s;ure taken by Mini&s;try here, the good or bad effect of which is yet in the womb of time, and may prove a mon&s;trous unnatural birth.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth re&s;olution, I mu&s;t own that I have no grounds on which to ju&s;tify or defend the town meetings of Bo&s;ton on the 14th of June, &amp; 12th of September&mdash;for their imprudencies have taken the ground from under my feet; yet knowing that <HI>the generality of the people</HI> there met, are and ever have been a faithful, valuable and loyal people, I will &s;till hope that there was nothing &s;o mi&s;chievous in their inten|tions
<PB N="5" REF="011423_0005_0F832C7BF5113480">
as the a&s;pect of them was bad and &s;u&s;picious. I will &s;till hope that independency never was in their heads&mdash;I am &s;ure &s;edition and rebellion never was in their hearts, however they may have been deluded and mi&s;led into actions which they did not under&s;tand, and have not &s;een the con&s;equences of.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and eighth re&s;olutions do indeed contain very heavy and very crimi|nal charges upon the town meeting of Bo&s;ton, and on the meeting of convention. They are not indeed charged with trea&s;on and mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on in the direct and <HI>technical terms thereof;</HI> but when we are told that all tho&s;e terms are cautiou&s;ly avoided, and yet hear it &s;aid, at the &s;ame time, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far, upon the examination of the acts and deeds committed (all con&s;piring to u&s;urpations of the powers of government, and the &s;itting up of new and uncon&s;titutional authority in|dependent of the crown of Great Britain) how far they may amount to trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on&mdash;I own, Sir, I am &s;till more afraid of tho&s;e words than if the charge had been direct and technical, as I do not &s;ee what (by implication or con|&s;truction) they may not lead to; and therefore, Sir, if there be any trea&s;on, or mi&s;|pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, it would have been fairer to have charged them with it directly, in the technical terms thereof, than to leave any future judge, or future jury, <HI>to tran&s;|late our words into technical terms hereafter.</HI> But let us examine how the facts do actually &s;tand: if the &s;electmen of Bo&s;ton had i&s;&s;ued precepts for the electing of deputies to meet in convention, as a general a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;entatives of the province, they would undoubtedly have u&s;urped the powers of government, &amp; not only manife&s;ted a de&s;ign to &s;et up, but would have actually &s;et up, a new and uncon&s;titutional authority, independent of the crown of Great Britain; and the convention meeting at that predicament, would have been a direct trea&s;onable meeting. The i&s;&s;uing a precept cannot be done but under the authority of the King's writ, which pa&s;&s;es under the great &s;eal of the province: the forms of &s;uch precept, and &s;uch writ, are pre&s;cribed and directed by a law of the province; nor can any other letter or matter i&s;&s;ued in any other form be, by any implication or con&s;truction what&s;oever, deemed a precept. On the contrary, that the &s;elect men of one town &s;hould write letters to the &s;elect men of other towns, de&s;iring them to appoint committees to meet and convene upon matters of common concern, hath been the common law and invariable practice of that country, from their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, and is in one particular in&s;tance directed &amp; required to be done by a &s;tatute of the province&mdash;But as the candor of the gentlemen induces them to recede from this charge, and to alter the words <HI>i&s;&s;uing a precept,</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>writing a letter,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay no more on that head.</P>
<P>Deputies are &s;uch as are elected or <HI>deputed to &s;erve for and repre&s;ent the freeholders of the province in general a&s;&s;embly, appointed under the great &s;eal to be held or convened.</HI> The&s;e deputies mu&s;t be freeholders, and elected or deputed by freeholders&mdash;mu&s;t be elected by direction of a precept under the King's writ.&mdash;If therefore the town-meetings had elected &s;uch deputies it would have been a trea&s;onable u&s;urpation of the powers of government: but the fact is, that the town meeting cho&s;e <HI>one or more per&s;ons</HI> each, <HI>as a committee,</HI> which they are authori&s;ed by the practice and law of their province to do. The per&s;ons cho&s;en for the&s;e committees need not be free|holders, nor are they cho&s;en by freeholders, but by any inhabitant qualified to meet
<PB N="6" REF="011423_0006_0F832C7C965ABB88">
in town meeting. The election, therefore, of &s;uch <HI>is not &s;etting up a new and uncon|&s;titutional authority&mdash;is no u&s;urpation of the powers of government.</HI> And although the word convening, or convention, from the u&s;e of it in this country in the year 1688, and by the &s;trange and unaccountable application of it in the town meeting referring to that period as a precedent, may convey to us <HI>here</HI> an idea of a mo&s;t dangerous and unwarrantable a&s;&s;embly, and the more dangerous and unwarrantable, if any ca&s;e was &s;uppo&s;ed that could give ground for &s;uch a&s;&s;embly: yet in that country the word <HI>convene</HI> is a mere concurrent word to the word <HI>meeting.</HI> By an act of the 4th of William and Mary, for regulating town&s;hips, it is &s;aid, <Q>the freeholders &s;hall annually meet and <HI>convene.</HI></Q> By the 5th and 6th of George the &s;econd, touching precinct meetings, it is &s;aid, "the freeholders and inhabitants &s;o <HI>convened.</HI>"&mdash;And by the 1&s;t of Anne, commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;ewers are impowered to meet and <HI>convene.</HI>&mdash; So that &s;o far as the <HI>word</HI> goes, meeting and convening, or meeting in convention, means no more than a common and u&s;ual act But, Sir, as it did meet and con|vene, in &s;o que&s;tionable a form, I hope I may be permitted to con&s;ider the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> in meeting&mdash;the <HI>conduct</HI> of this convention when met&mdash;and the <HI>effect</HI> of its meeting. Whatever may have been contained in the letter from the &s;elect men of the town of Bo&s;ton, yet that was <HI>neither the foundation nor the warrant</HI> for their convening.</P>
<P>Seeing the violent agitation and &s;tate of inflammability in which the people of the maritime parts of the province e&s;pecially were heated to a degree of madne&s;s, the town meetings cho&s;e committees, and the committees met and convened, in order to prevent any mi&s;chief and ill con&s;equences that might have ari&s;en from that <HI>dan|gerous &s;tate of the people's minds.</HI> They met to <HI>promote, to the utmo&s;t of their abilities, peace and good order</HI> among&s;t the people, and due <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government.</HI> They met to re&s;train them from going into any illegal or <HI>uncon&s;titutional practices,</HI> and to turn their &s;pirit into the right and con&s;titutional channel of hoping and waiting for redre&s;s of &s;uch grievances as they thought they were under, by petitions preferred to his Maje&s;ty, and by relying on the ju&s;tice of the nation: and their <HI>conduct,</HI> Sir, was agreeable to this de&s;ign; for the moment that they met, before <HI>they had advice of the arrival</HI> of the men of war, and of the troops, <Q>They di&s;claimed all pretence to any authoritative or governmental acts, and did actually di&s;claim all pretences of u&s;urping any of the rights of &s;overeignty, or even of arrogating to them&s;elves any authority what&s;oever.</Q> They gave their free and &s;incere advice, not in an au|thoritative, but merely friendly manner&mdash;advi&s;ing and per&s;uading the people of the province to avoid all tumults and di&s;orders&mdash;&s;tating to them the dreadful con&s;e|quences of &s;uch&mdash;and converting the channel of their conduct into that of reliance upon government, in expectation of the effect that the petition &s;ent home &s;ome time before by their repre&s;entatives would have, and undertaking them&s;elves as commit|tees met and convened to repeat that mea&s;ure of petitioning; the drawing up of which petitions, one to the Governor, another to the King, and the writing a letter to Mr. De Berdt (whom they con&s;idered as a &s;ort of agent for the province) was all that they actually did.</P>
<P>The authority which the&s;e gentlemen had with the people, and the prudent and temperate &s;teps which they took, does to me appear the rather to have been the cau&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="011423_0007_0F832C7E7AF308B0">
that no di&s;turbances have happened in the province &s;ince the arrival of the troops, than any other rea&s;on that can be given, however &s;pecious, and however calculated for our belief; and to this meeting or convention I impute this good effect.</P>
<P>This, Sir, being to the be&s;t of my judgment the actual &s;tate, and the real facts of this ca&s;e&mdash;if I con&s;ider my giving my opinion upon the re&s;olutions before us as a verdict upon an inque&s;t, however I may believe and be of opinion, there may have been a conduct in many things very blameable&mdash;in many more imprudent;&mdash;yet, upon the whole of the charge brought in the&s;e re&s;olutions, I mu&s;t, as far as my judgment goes, think <HI>it is no true bill:</HI> and, if this be my opinion of the re&s;olutions, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, if I con&s;ider the addre&s;s (as I do) as a pre&s;entment upon this in|que&s;t, give my opinion again&s;t that al&s;o: but I am not only again&s;t it as a pre&s;ent|ment upon a charge which I think no true bill, but as it goes to the advi&s;ing the crown to a proceeding directly contrary to that law, and to tho&s;e rights which I think the people of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay are intitled to&mdash;as it goes to the advi&s;ing the crown to a proceeding which, con&s;i&s;tent with its own acts, it cannot go into, and which I think none of his Maje&s;ty's council will ever advi&s;e him to enter into;&mdash;at lea&s;t, &s;uch advice would put his Maje&s;ty under &s;uch difficulty, as no one man would wi&s;h to put another.&mdash;And what I am going to &s;ay is the foundation of this opinion, which I wi&s;h and call upon the crown lawyers to attend to and con|&s;ider.&mdash;The crown, in the 8th of William the Third, gave its con&s;ent to an act of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, for regulating trials for high trea&s;on within that province, according to an act of parliament of the 7th of William. I know that no provincial act whatever, even with the con&s;ent of the crown added to it, can alter or &s;uper&s;ede any act of parliament&mdash;I know, and will allow, that this act does not &s;u|per&s;ede or repeal the thirty-fifth of Harry the Eighth&mdash;but &s;o far forth as the i&s;&s;uing this &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion for trying trea&s;ons <HI>here in England under that act,</HI> be a mea&s;ure which the King may or may not take&mdash;I do &s;ay, that the crown having given its con&s;ent that the people of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay <HI>&s;hall be tryed within that province, according to the &s;eventh of William,</HI> &s;o far as that will or plea&s;ure can be bound by that con&s;ent &s;o given, never will or can, con&s;i&s;tent with the acts of the crown, i&s;&s;ue &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion to bring any delinquent out of the province, and to try him here upon the act of Harry the Eighth.</P>
<P>I &s;ugge&s;ted this before in the form of doubt, in hopes it might have drawn forth &s;ome an&s;wer. I do now pronounce peremptorily and po&s;itively that the crown nei|their will or can i&s;&s;ue &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion, and I call upon the crown lawyers to an|&s;wer this, if they have an&s;wer to give. The people have thought them&s;elves aggrieved in having the ca&s;es of their property determined in the court of Admiralty, without the benefit of juries&mdash;perhaps that complaint may not be founded entirely in law; but if they think &s;o, and if this procedure by which they may, without the pre&s;ent|ment of an inque&s;t of twelve lawful men, be taken into cu&s;tody, and in that cu&s;tody &s;ent over hither to be put upon their trial for their lives, &s;hould &s;trike their hearts upon this old &s;ore, how deeply mu&s;t it wound them, and to what a dangerous &s;tate of de&s;peration may it not drive their minds. If they con&s;ider that they may be pre|&s;ented by their Governor, a &s;ingle man, and in con&s;equence of that pre&s;entment
<PB N="8" REF="011423_0008_0F832C7EF5D31D20">
taken into cu&s;tody, and &s;ent pri&s;oners 3000 miles to be put upon their trial, which of it&s;elf, &s;hould they be acquitted, is a puni&s;hment of the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t cruel nature: if they con&s;ider that they are thus deprived of the common liberty which we enjoy, of not being pre&s;ented and put upon trial but by the inque&s;t of twelve lawful men of our country&mdash;to what predicament mu&s;t they think them&s;elves reduced&mdash;I own I dread the con&s;equence if the Americans &s;hould feel that they are in that predicament, but I am comforted becau&s;e I am &s;ure they never will feel it, as I am convinced that &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion never will nor can be i&s;&s;ued, that &s;uch proceedings never will be, nor can be, carried into execution.</P>
<P>I will therefore next con&s;ider this mea&s;ure connected with the military manoeuvres in America&mdash;<HI>as a political mea&s;ure</HI> planned and de&s;igned to enforce the execution of the revenue laws in that country.&mdash;To be able to judge of the effect of &s;uch mea|&s;ure, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the ca&s;e to which it is applied.</P>
<P>On one hand you have your declaratory law,&mdash;your revenue laws as the exertion of the declared right&mdash;you have your commi&s;&s;ioners to execute the&s;e laws&mdash;and the military <HI>to enforce</HI> this execution.&mdash;On the other hand, the Americans do univer&s;ally, invariably and unalterably declare, that they ought not to &s;ubmit to any internal taxes impo&s;ed upon them by any legi&s;lature wherein they have not repre&s;entatives of their own election.&mdash;On this principle they oppo&s;e &s;uch taxes by their Petitions and Remon&s;trances <HI>only, as yet,</HI> but there is &s;omething threatning in the bad temper and ill blood which &s;eems to be forced up&mdash;&s;o that the i&s;&s;ue is well nigh brought to force.&mdash;The people of that country and the king's troops are, as it were, &s;et in array again&s;t each other.&mdash;The &s;word indeed is not drawn&mdash;but the hand is upon it.&mdash; The word for action is not indeed yet given, but mi&s;chief is on tip-toe; and the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance would in a moment throw every thing into confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed. And if &s;ome <HI>mode of policy</HI> does not interpo&s;e to remove this exertion of military power&mdash;the union between Great Britain and North America <HI>is broken for ever</HI>&mdash;unle&s;s (what is wor&s;e) <HI>both are united in one common ruin.</HI></P>
<P>Where the whole &s;pirit and bent of a people, who have the powers of government within them&s;elves, is fixed and determined again&s;t a tax&mdash;experience and common &s;en&s;e will convince you, that no civil power, no civil coercion, will ever a&s;&s;e&s;s or collect it.</P>
<P>It will be found al&s;o in the trial, fact; that no military force can do this&mdash;it ne|ver did, &s;o long as the <HI>forms</HI> only of government remained: it cannot a&s;&s;e&s;s or collect: it may rai&s;e a contribution by <HI>military execution</HI>&mdash;but that is not <HI>government,</HI> it is <HI>war.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir! I mu&s;t beg to mark the di&s;tinction between the application of mili|tary force in this ca&s;e, and the application of it in the u&s;ual ca&s;es which ari&s;e in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Military force is never applied, but when called for by the civil magi&s;trate&mdash;never acts, but in aid of the civil magi&s;trate&mdash;and under the orders and command of the civil magi&s;trate: but if they are &s;ent to Bo&s;ton&mdash;the civil magi&s;trate the mean while prote&s;ting that they are not wanted&mdash;if they are &s;ent, not in aid of the civil magi|&s;trate, but as it were to force him to act: are not put under his orders, but take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his juri&s;diction, and take the command&mdash;that is not <HI>government,</HI> it is <HI>war.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011423_0009_0F832C7F98259848">If the people are indeed in rebellion&mdash;it is a nece&s;&s;ary war: but if they neither make, nor intend, any oppo&s;ition by force or arms&mdash;if they have continued, and do continue, to pay the duties&mdash;what is there for the troops to do? however the people may &s;ubmit, in the&s;e points, <HI>in fact</HI>&mdash;the troops will never convert them <HI>to the opinion of the right.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot withold an ob&s;ervation which a friend of mine in that country makes on this occa&s;ion: <Q>If you mean to govern the country by the aid of military force, you have not &s;ent a &s;ufficient number of troops&mdash; if you do not mean this, you have already &s;ent too many.</Q> But&mdash; thank God, re&s;i&s;tance by force and arms is not the re&s;i&s;tance which you have to guard again&s;t. The people of America are husbandmen and mer|chants; who have lived by their dependence upon, and under the protection of Great Britain&mdash;are unaccu&s;tomed to arms&mdash;are not trained up in a mili|tary &s;pirit&mdash;do not (to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of their own) <HI>feel hold</HI> to re&s;i&s;t by arms: yet, if you attempt to force <HI>taxes</HI> again&s;t the &s;pirit of the people there, you will find, when perhaps it is too late, that <HI>they are</HI> of a &s;pirit which will re&s;i&s;t all force&mdash;which will grow <HI>&s;tronger</HI> by being <HI>forced</HI>&mdash; will prove &s;uperior to all force&mdash;and ever has been unconquerable: they are of a &s;pirit to abide, nay, to court, per&s;ecution: and if among&s;t other propo&s;itions which they have taken up they &s;hould once take it into their heads that they are under a &s;tate of per&s;ecution; that &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m which is of their temper, and of their very nature, will ari&s;e; and every mi&s;chievous con&s;equence, in every extreme, will accompany it.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit is not dead in them; it is only dormant; the utmo&s;t care and &s;kill of tho&s;e who lead them, either in civil or religious matters, is employ|ed to re&s;train and keep it down. If this &s;pirit &s;hould once take fire&mdash;and believe me, Sir, it is in &s;uch a &s;tate of inflammability that the &s;malle&s;t &s;park would give it fire&mdash;it will break out into a flame, which no rea&s;on, no pru|dence, no force can re&s;train: tho&s;e who yet retain &s;ome lead, and have kept matters from running to extremities, to whom the people &s;till li&s;ten&mdash;will either lo&s;e that lead, or will take the lead of this &s;pirit when it &s;hall be once gone forth&mdash;and if the mini&s;ters (whom we here call the clergy) once fall in with this &s;pirit; if the people once call upon them, they mu&s;t take the lead&mdash;and if they do, the people (to u&s;e their own phra&s;e) will be led by Mo&s;es and Aaron, by the civil and religious, under a bond of unity that no factions will divide, no force can break.</P>

<P>That &s;pirit which led their ance&s;tors to break off from every thing which is near and dear to the human heart&mdash;from every connection which friend|&s;hip, relation, blood could give&mdash;which led them to quit every comfort that a &s;ettled and civilized country (their own native country) could afford; and to encourage every difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s, which a wild wilderne&s;s of &s;avages could oppo&s;e to them, to &s;truggle even for their exi&s;tence;&mdash;that &s;pirit, equally &s;trong and equally inflamed, has but a &s;light and trifling &s;a|crifice to make at this time&mdash;they have not to quit their native country, but to defend it&mdash;they have not to for&s;ake their friends and relations, but to unite with and to &s;tand by them, in one common union. The only &s;a|crifice they have to make is that of a few follies and a few luxuries.&mdash;It is not nece&s;&s;ity that is the ground of their commerce with you; it is merely the affectation of our modes and cu&s;toms&mdash;the love for home, as they call England, that makes them like every thing which comes from thence; but pa&s;&s;ion may be conquered by pa&s;&s;ion, and they will abominate as &s;incerely as they now love you; and if they do, they have within them&s;elves every thing which is nece&s;&s;ary to the food, raiment, or the dwelling of mankind, and have no need of your commerce.</P>
<P>But that gentlemen may not think this to be mere harangue&mdash;I will come to particulars. They have a great &s;urplu&s;age of hides and leather&mdash; hides are even part of their exports. They have peltry&mdash;they have wool, linen and cotton. They work up all the&s;e, and have home-made and home-&s;pun, &s;ufficient for their cloathing. They have fi&s;h, game, beef, mutton and every other article at about one third of the price which we pay here&mdash;they have iron and copper which they ca&s;t and work up in every form that is nece&s;&s;ary. The only difficulty which they have at fir&s;t to la|bour again&s;t, will be the manufacture of hardware. But when I tell the H&mdash; that they do already make all the implements of husbandry better than tho&s;e which come to them from England&mdash;and that the husbandmen buy &s;uch, in preference to tho&s;e made in England&mdash;they will &s;ee how large a &s;tride they have taken towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this branch of bu&s;ine&s;s: and (overloaded, from various rea&s;ons, as every branch of our

manufactures is with manufacturers) if a &s;top be put to them but for one year,&mdash;the tide is upon the turn; the manufacturers with the turn of that tide will go over in &s;hoals to America&mdash;as they once came over hither from the Netherlands. If it be not the humour of the h&mdash; to bear to be told this <HI>now, they will remember it hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>In one word. If this &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m &s;hould once ari&s;e upon the idea of per&s;ecution&mdash;tho&s;e people whom Great Britain hath to this hour drawn as it were with a thread&mdash;and whom it has governed, as you have been ingeniou&s;ly told, with a little paper and packthread&mdash;you will not for the future be able to govern it with a rod of iron: and every benefit which <HI>this</HI> country has derived from <HI>that</HI> country, will be &s;topped at every &s;ource.</P>
<P>If it be not the humour of the h&mdash; <HI>to believe this at pre&s;ent</HI>&mdash;I only beg they will remember it has been &s;aid, and <HI>that they are forewarned of it.</HI></P>
<P>If this then be the &s;tate of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and the&s;e the con&s;equences of proceeding by <HI>exertion of force</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>mea&s;ures of policy</HI>&mdash;and if after all, force will not and cannot produce the effect aimed at&mdash;but will produce &s;uch directly contrary and pernicious effects: if after alienating the people of the colonies&mdash;after di&s;&s;olving the union that is between us&mdash;after break|ing all communication of commerce between us; it &s;hall be found impo&s;|&s;ible to tax a people who have the powers of government within them|&s;elves, unle&s;s by and with their own con&s;ent, either in the grant, or by their acquie&s;cing in the grant with their con&s;ent to a&s;&s;e&s;s and collect &s;uch tax&mdash;if this be the ca&s;e&mdash;there remains no other alternative, but to adopt <HI>&s;ome mode of policy,</HI> that will carry that con&s;ent along with the power of government.</P>
<P>But why do I endeavour, under the di&s;couragement which gentlemen give to any rea&s;oning, any con&s;ideration of this matter; why &s;hould I en|deavour to obtrude my poor rea&s;oning &s;o ill received? Why &s;hould I talk of adopting <HI>modes of policy</HI> when the &s;horter way&mdash;of the que&s;tion and de|ci&s;ion, the &s;hort way of <HI>force,</HI> &s;eems already adopted? Neverthele&s;s, even under this di&s;couragement, if gentlemen attend, I will mark out <HI>that mode of policy</HI> by which every evil may be avoided, and all again be re&s;tored to peace, to union and government. This mode lies in the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in the actual &s;tate of things&mdash;it is the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be under&s;tood&mdash; the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be executed&mdash;nay, the only one that is practicable.</P>
<P>What I would wi&s;h to &s;ugge&s;t to the con&s;ideration of the h&mdash;, and what I know would &s;ucceed&mdash;is this plain and &s;imple advice&mdash;that you
<PB N="12" REF="011423_0012_0F832C81F7E55768">
&s;hould not &s;tir up, but wave, all que&s;tions which become mere articles of faith&mdash;that you &s;hould make no innovotions in practice, nor &s;uffer any en|croachments to be made on government&mdash;that you &s;hould take the ground that you now actually &s;tand upon&mdash;and that government &s;hould act upon that ground, as it hath done invariably for 160 years pa&s;t, from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colonies.</P>
<P>This would heal that union between the mother country and her colonies, which hath been vitiated;&mdash;would re&s;tore that communication of com|merce which otherwi&s;e will be cut off&mdash;would revive again the &s;pirit of obedience&mdash;and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the power of government.</P>
<P>Truth lies in a very narrow compa&s;s. I &s;hall not therefore take up much time in explaining to the h&mdash; this plain and practical propo&s;ition. I &s;ee the h&mdash; is im|patient to decide; but it is for that very rea&s;on, &s;eeing the danger of the deci&s;ion, that I labour to obtrude and even force, again&s;t their inclinations, my poor opinion to their con&s;ideration&mdash;I do not attempt or pretend to amu&s;e and entertain them. I cannot expect their attention, it is from the importance of the &s;ubject that I be&s;eech their patience.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colonies, till within three or four years pa&s;t, the people there have enjoyed and exerci&s;ed the power of taxing them&s;elves <HI>internally</HI>&mdash; of giving and granting their own money,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, For the &s;upport of government <HI>within the limits and precincts of their re&s;|pective juri&s;dictions.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, For the aid of the mother country when&s;oever called upon or <HI>required for that &s;pecial purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In which the mother country never interfered.&mdash;On the other hand, the mother country has uninterruptedly and invariably laid and impo&s;ed upon them <HI>external taxes</HI> by port duties&mdash;which the people never have oppo&s;ed&mdash;never con&s;idered as a grievance&mdash;nay, never objected to, or petitioned again&s;t.</P>
<P>Government gave to the&s;e people no occa&s;ion of di&s;putes, by laying <HI>internal taxes;</HI> and hath always found rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the liberality and chearfulne&s;s of their free grants and aids.</P>
<P>The people, on the other hand, <HI>never objected to external taxes</HI> &mdash;to impo&s;ts, &s;ub|&s;idies and duties. They know that the expre&s;s conditions of their &s;ettlements and e&s;tabli&s;hments were, that they &s;hould pay the&s;e&mdash;and therefore they never have had any di&s;putes with government on this head&mdash;but have always found rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied <HI>in the moderation with which government hath exerci&s;ed this power.</HI></P>
<P>Within four or five years pa&s;t, it was thought advi&s;eable to lay internal taxes on the people of the colonies. The que&s;tions which this mea&s;ure and the repeal of it, rai&s;ed and brought into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion&mdash;and the manner in which this que&s;tion was mo&s;t unaccountably agitated; by arguing from precedents of external taxes to the ju&s;tice and propriety of internal taxes; by &s;aying, that there was no difference&mdash; has taught the colonies, to retort the rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition, by arguing from internal to external. In this argument they have adopted your own propo&s;ition&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="011423_0013_0F832C82D78535B0">
and by your help have rea&s;oned them&s;elves into an oppo&s;ition to all external taxes which they had hitherto &s;ubmitted to for a century and half. Hence we receive at this day complaints of grievances, calls for redre&s;s, petitions and remon&s;trances again&s;t the&s;e taxes&mdash;and hence, all the mi&s;chiefs of this day's perplexity.</P>
<P>But, Sir! all this is a mere outwork; advanced on your ground&mdash;it is not their real defence, on ground which they hope to maintain&mdash;it is mere argument <HI>ad ho|minem;</HI> it is fighting you with your own weapons. Neither their own principles, nor the con&s;titution of their e&s;tabli&s;hments, give ground for this rea&s;oning&mdash;nor do their own arguments lead them to the&s;e conclu&s;ions. They neither are nor can be in earne&s;t in making the&s;e claims, otherwi&s;e than having &s;omething to negotiate with, and to give up.</P>
<P>If therefore you will act in the government of the colonies as you have done for 160 years pa&s;t; and will take the ground that this bu&s;ine&s;s does actually now &s;tand upon&mdash;and will &s;uffer it to be known and under&s;tood that you do really adopt this mode of admini&s;tration, all may be quiet, and would be quiet, as &s;oon as a &s;hip could arrive with the news of it in North America.</P>
<P>The ground that this bu&s;ine&s;s doth actually &s;tand upon is this&mdash;you have now no internal taxes upon which que&s;tions may be rai&s;ed or di&s;putes ari&s;e with the Americans.&mdash;You have no conce&s;&s;ions to make&mdash;no repeals as to internal taxes&mdash; The external taxes which are laid upon the colonies, are no other as to the matter of them, than &s;uch as the colonies have ever &s;ince their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;ubmitted to and paid: and you have pledged your&s;elves, that if in the mode of the&s;e taxes there be any thing which is injurious to the &s;pirit of commerce&mdash;any thing which is matter of real grievance&mdash;you will be ready to relieve and to amend: there is not at pre&s;ent any intention of extending the exerci&s;e of our power to <HI>the laying internal taxes;</HI> nor will any future mini&s;try (be they compo&s;ed of whom&s;oever they may) over venture to lay internal taxes.</P>
<P>But as there are tho&s;e who &s;ay that there is no &s;uch di&s;tinction&mdash;as al&s;o others who do not &s;ee how this di&s;tinction can ari&s;e&mdash;I will, if the impatience of gentlemen to come to a deci&s;ion without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, without a debate, will permit me, mark &s;uch di&s;tinction: after which, I will e&s;tabli&s;h the plain, &s;imple advice which I pre|&s;ume to give on tho&s;e rea&s;onings which I advance, as to the policy, the wi&s;dom, the experience, the ju&s;tice, the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="1">1. The conditions of the grants and charters under which the&s;e people did fir&s;t quit this country and &s;ettle in America; and on which their corporations and powers of government are e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;do expre&s;ly &s;tipulate for the payment of &s;ub&s;idies, duties, and impo&s;ts, almo&s;t without variation, in the &s;ame words, through|out every grant and charter. I need not now repeat or recite the&s;e clau&s;es&mdash;they are apparent, and open to the in&s;pection of every one.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>every charter does expre&s;ly or intentionally</HI> make a di&s;tiction between the&s;e and &s;uch taxes as they are permitted and impowered to lay on their own e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal, <HI>within the precincts and limits of their territories;</HI> and on &s;uch tran&s;actions as &s;hall pa&s;s <HI>within their own juri&s;diction.</HI></P>
<P>The charter of Virginia, after having directly fixed the right of payment of the &s;ub&s;idies, impo&s;ts and duties, from the company to the crown; and having made a grant of the &s;ame to the company for 21 years&mdash;has the&s;e words: <Q>That they

&s;hall be free of all &s;ub&s;idies and cu&s;toms in Virginia for 21 years, and <HI>from all taxes and impo&s;itions for over.</HI></Q>&mdash;Making not only an expre&s;s di&s;tinction in the <HI>matter</HI> but in the <HI>right</HI>&mdash;and in con&s;equence of this di&s;tinction, the incorporating charters of government gave them power to tax them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The charter of Maryland, in all the grants therein made, makes an expre&s;s &s;aving of impo&s;ts, duties and cu&s;toms to the king and his heirs for ever, which the people of that province by the expre&s;s condition of their charter are bound to pay&mdash;yet the &s;ame charter, likewi&s;e making the di&s;tinction both in <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> between internal and external taxation&mdash;<Q>We our heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hall at no time &s;et and make, or cau&s;e to &s;et, any impo&s;ition, cu&s;tom, or other taxation, rate or contribu|tion what&s;oever, in and upon the <HI>dwellers and inhabitants</HI> of the afore&s;aid pro|vince, for <HI>their lands, goods, tenements or chattels</HI> WITHIN THE SAID PROVINCE.</Q> &mdash;And in con&s;equence of this, the legi&s;lature of the province has power granted to impo&s;e and a&s;&s;e&s;s taxes within the precincts and juri&s;dictions of its territories.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner (for it would be tire&s;ome to cite all particulars) and almo&s;t in the &s;ame words, all the charters of incorporation and government&mdash;which are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the original grants of the lands and territories&mdash;make the &s;ame di&s;tinction&mdash;&s;tipulating expre&s;ly for the payment of <HI>all impo&s;ts, &s;ub&s;idies and duties, according to the law of merchants.</HI>&mdash;But as to the lands, tenements and here|ditaments within the precincts and juri&s;dictions&mdash;leaving tho&s;e at large, as objects of the taxation of the &s;everal legi&s;latures which are re&s;pectively thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed; with powers to ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>all manner of laws,</HI> impo&s;e and a&s;&s;e&s;s, and to levy money on the lands and hereditaments within the bounds of their grants.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as this was both intentionally &amp; expre&s;ly the liberties &amp; franchi&s;es grant|ed to the&s;e colonies at their fir&s;t &s;ettlement; and &s;o under&s;tood; <HI>as far as the crown could or might grant</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virginia charter.</NOTE>.&mdash;So the exerci&s;e and admini&s;tration of government towards the&s;e people hath been for a century and half invariably conducted on this plan&mdash; always impo&s;ing or requiring external or port duties&mdash;never, till of late years, cal|ling forth the power of parliament to exert its <HI>ab&s;olate power</HI> in laying duties and taxes on the dwellers and inhabitants of tho&s;e colonies for their lands, heridita|ments or tran&s;actions within the precincts and juri&s;dictions of their &s;everal terri|tories.</P>
<P N="3">3. The colonies having been u&s;ed to this di&s;tinction by the cour&s;e and practice of government, have in their rea&s;oning marked <HI>an e&s;&s;ential difference in the nature of the thing.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever tax or duty is impo&s;ed upon external property imported into their country&mdash;is indeed annexed to the <HI>property,</HI> but not upon them either in their rights or per&s;ons; untill they choo&s;e, by purcha&s;ing that property with the tax an|nexed to it, to annex that tax al&s;o to them&s;elves: but this is an act of their own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Whatever tax is impo&s;ed on any property immediately and intimately united with their per&s;ons or rights, mu&s;t be paid without any interpo&s;ition of their own will, unle&s;s they quit that property, or forego that right.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011423_0015_0F832C843108C3D0">The fir&s;t is external; and annexed or not, at their own will&mdash;the &s;econd is in|ternal, and <HI>ab&s;olutely annexed to what is in&s;eperable from them.</HI></P>
<P>Seeing this <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference in the nature of the thing,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by invariable pre&s;cription from their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment as a government&mdash;they rea&s;on (and ju&s;tly too) from this di&s;tinction and this pre&s;cription, That whatever right of taxing them|&s;elves within the precincts and limits of their own juri&s;dictions they may enjoy by the principles of the Briti&s;h government and their own con&s;titution; or whatever rights they may have been permitted to exerci&s;e by pre&s;cription and practice&mdash; &s;uch right or rights are confined to their own limits. How&s;oever they may rea&s;on right or wrong as to internal taxes, their arguments go not beyond low water mark &mdash;whatever pa&s;&s;es the great ocean <HI>to</HI> or <HI>from without,</HI> either is originally, or com|mences to be, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from their internal rights and property: who|ever acts and trades beyond the limits of their precincts, acts and trades under the expre&s;s conditions of the maritime laws, both of <HI>regulation</HI> and <HI>revenue.</HI></P>
<P>If therefore there be any difference in this di&s;tinction&mdash;in the nature, circum|&s;tances and effect of taxes, internal and external&mdash;if there be any di&s;tinction in the ca&s;e whether the con&s;ent of the &s;ubject goes or does not go along with a payment made under a tax&mdash;&s;o far as the&s;e di&s;tinctions do go, &s;o far is there a di&s;tinction in the right; re&s;pecting the extent to which the rights of &s;uch people may be ad|mitted.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the principles on which the Hou&s;e of Commons grounds its peculiar right to originate all grants, and to frame all money bills, gives the colonies rea&s;onable expectation, that, <HI>whatever be the right</HI> of the king, lords and commons, a&s;&s;embled in parliament to make laws which &s;hall be binding on the colonies in all ca&s;es whatever&mdash;the Hou&s;e of Commons will never <HI>in act and deed</HI> originate any grants from the lands or money within the limits and precincts of the colonies, until it &s;hall be clear beyond all doubt that the members of that hou&s;e <HI>do in act and deed repre&s;ent</HI> the counties, cities and boroughs in America, as they do the counties, cities, and boroughs of Great-Britain, <HI>for whom they give and grant</HI>&mdash;or that ac|cording to the principles maintained by the Hou&s;e of Commons, they do give and grant for the counties, cities and boroughs whom they do in act and deed repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, Sir! no mini&s;try will ever venture&mdash;the pre&s;ent do not de&s;ire or mean&mdash; to propo&s;e &s;uch taxes to the Hou&s;e of Commons: and that hou&s;e never will, con|&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e principles by which it maintains this right of originating grants, exclu&s;ive of the lords&mdash;I &s;ay, never will, adopt and originate any &s;uch tax.</P>
<P>What then remains&mdash;but that as you are in fact, and by good fortune, re&s;tored again <HI>to the &s;afe old ground on which this matter hath always &s;tood</HI>&mdash;but that you re&s;ume again the &s;pirit of your old policy. I am founded when I &s;ay that this would re&s;tore again peace, order and government.&mdash;I have letters in my pocket from &s;ome of the principal, &s;ome of the leading men in that country&mdash;who &s;ay we do not call upon Great Britain to give up her rights and claims&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> de&s;ire to be returned back, and &s;et again upon our old &s;afe ground, which we under&s;tood, and that in the exerci&s;e of your power you would return to your old policy.</P>
<P>Let the matter of right re&s;t upon the declaratory law, and &s;ay no more about it. It may be under&s;tood (as it is in the &s;ame words as that re&s;pecting Ireland) that it
<PB N="16" REF="011423_0016_0F832C84EF24F458">
&s;hall &s;tand in the &s;ame line of admini&s;tration&mdash;I &s;ay it may be &s;o under&s;tood, and will be better under&s;tood by being never explained.</P>
<P>Do nothing which may bring into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion <HI>que&s;tions of right,</HI> which mu&s;t be|come <HI>mere articles of faith</HI>&mdash;Go into no innovations in practice, and &s;uffer no en|croachments on government&mdash;Extend not the power which you have of impo&s;ing taxes, to the laying internal taxes on the colonies&mdash;Continue to exerci&s;e the power, which you have always exerci&s;ed, of laying &s;ub&s;idies, impo&s;ts, and duties&mdash;but ex|erci&s;e this, as you have always hitherto done, with prudence and moderation, and directed by the &s;pirit of commercial wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit and mode of government would cement again that union which is &s;hattered, if it is not quite broken&mdash;would re&s;tore again that &s;pirit of obedience, which the lo&s;s of authority on the one hand, and the lo&s;s of affection on the other, hath in|corrupted&mdash; would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority as well as force of <HI>civil government,</HI> which has almo&s;t lo&s;t its force by lo&s;ing its authority.&mdash;EXERT THE SPIRIT OF POLICY that you may not ruin the colonies and your&s;elves BY EXERTING FORCE.</P>
