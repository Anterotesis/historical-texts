<P>"And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fullne&s;s of Him that filleth all in all."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Son of God, the Second Per&s;on in the ador|able Trinity, having a&s;&s;umed the human nature, into a per&s;onal union with the divine; he humbled him|&s;elf and became obedient unto death, even the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s: who having thereby &s;atisfied the divine law, for tho&s;e for whom he was delivered unto death; was therefore rai&s;ed again for their ju&s;tificati|on, and exalted unto, and &s;eated down at the right-hand of the throne of the maje&s;ty on high; endowed with all power and authority to execute the various purpo&s;es of his coming and kingdom, to the everla&s;t|ing prai&s;e of his grace. "Exalted," as &s;aid in the pre|ceeding ver&s;e, "by the mighty power of God, far a|bove all principality and power, and might, and domi|nion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come." "Who," as &s;aid in the words of our text, "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to his church, which is his body; the fullne&s;s of him that filleth all in all." All things whether in hea|ven or on earth, are &s;ubjected to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, put under him, to be ruled and governed by him, un|til brought into entire &s;ubjection to the great ends and
<PB N="4" REF="011692_0003_0F87EBF8DD6FFAF0">de&s;igns of his kingdom: "For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all things under his feet." 1 Cor. 15.25.</P>
<P>But then, at the right-hand of the Father, it is in a &s;pecial manner given to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to be the head over all things to the church: even the head of all life, influence and direction, to that people which are to be gathered under him as their head, collected together in him, as his body, to be animated and quickened by him, and to be filled with all his glorious fullne&s;s.&mdash; In further &s;peaking to which, I purpo&s;e to con&s;ider, and &s;hew,</P>
<P>The import of Chri&s;t's being the head of his body, the church. The nature of that body; of what &s;ub|jects it is made up: and how to be ruled and govern|ed, as to the order and di&s;cipline thereof.&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="1">I. Of the import of Chri&s;t's being the head of his body, the church. And as he is the head, he has in all things the pre-eminence. Is the author and fini&s;her of the faith. The purcha&s;er, and giver of all &s;piritual, heavenly and everla&s;ting mercies and ble&s;&s;ings. The great fountain of light and life. The great Prophet &s;ent of God, to reveal the will of the Father. The great High-Prie&s;t, entered into the holy of holies, there to appear in the pre&s;ence of God for his people. But that which I have now, more particularly in view, to be in&s;i&s;ted upon is, That Chri&s;t's being the Head of his Body, the Church, implies, that he is the &s;overeign Lord and &s;ole King thereof. According to that of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 2.6. "Yet have I &s;et my King upon my holy hill of Zion." Compared with John 1.49. "Thou art the Son of God, the King of I&s;rael." And John 12.13. "Ho&s;annah, ble&s;&s;ed is the King of I&s;ra|el, that cometh in the name of the Lord." And ver. 15. "Fear not, daughter of Sion, behold thy King cometh, &s;itting on an a&s;&s;es colt."</P>
<P>And that Chri&s;t is King, implies, that he is &s;ole law|giver to his Body, the Church; as &s;aid by the prophet
<PB N="5" REF="011692_0004_0F87EBF99D71DB68">I&s;aiah, "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law|giver, the Lord is our king, he will &s;ave us." And as king on the holy hill of Zion. Chri&s;t's Church is his kingdom, in and over which he rules and reigns. And &s;o his kingdom is not of a worldly, but entirely of a &s;piritual nature. And con&s;equently a kingdom entirely di&s;tinct, from the civil kingdom of this world. Nei|ther interfering with, nor dependent upon them. A|greeable to the an&s;wer, which Chri&s;t him&s;elf gave to Pilate; enquiring of him, whether he was the king of the Jews. "My kingdom is not of this world, if my kingdom were of this world then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence."</P>
<P>The civil powers that be, are ordained of God, to maintain peace and good order in the commonwealth: to be a terror to evil-doers, &amp; a prai&s;e &amp; encouragement to them that do well. But the&s;e civil kingdoms are altoge|ther of a worldly nature; their weapons are carnal, their puni&s;hments are corporal and &s;ecular; and all their ho|nours, emoluments and advantages are temporals. In regard to which civil kind of matters, Chri&s;t &s;aid, "Who made me a judge or divider over you." Luke 12.14. For the kingdom of Chri&s;t, is entirely of a &s;piritual nature: re&s;pecting the con&s;cience, and things &s;piritual and eternal. The laws, weapons, and defence, the penalties, benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of which, are all of a &s;piritual nature. Agreeable to that of St. Paul, 2 Cor. 9.4. "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God, to the pulling down &s;trong holds." No compul&s;ions, motives and induce|ments therefore, of a &s;ecular nature, have any thing to do in the kingdom of Chri&s;t; who&s;e &s;ole right it is, as king in Zion, to ordain and appoint, laws, &s;tatutes and ordinances, for the regulation, government and order of his hou&s;e and kingdom. And who accordingly has, &s;et forth in his go&s;pel, either by precept or exam|ple, all the laws and rules which he &s;aw needful and fit
<PB N="6" REF="011692_0005_0F87EBFA5D71EEF0">to appoint, for the regulation and government of his church. And nothing can be binding upon, or be a &s;afe rule unto, the con&s;ciences of Chri&s;t's &s;ubjects, but the&s;e injunctions only, which are plainly &s;tamped with his authority. The Lord Je&s;us did indeed commi&s;&s;ion his apo&s;tles to give orders and directions about the go|vernment of his churches; who proved their authority from Chri&s;t, to do &s;o, by the many wonderful works, which they wro't in his name. But no other &s;et of men, can have any claim to &s;uch authority, till they can produce the &s;ame evidence for it, that the apo&s;tles did. It is &s;aid indeed, in the 34th article of the Church of England, "That every particular or national church hath authority, to ordain, change and aboli&s;h ceremonies, or rights of the church, ordained only of man's authority." And well would it be indeed, to aboli&s;h all &s;uch rights, ordained only by men's authority. But to ordain &s;uch, to be binding upon the con&s;ciences of men, cannot be done, without infringing upon the royal prerogative of Chri&s;t, as &s;ole king and lawgiver in his church. And it is equally incon&s;i&s;tent, to introduce any civil laws, how|ever whole&s;om in the commonwealth, as a rule of judgment, in matters pertaining to the con&s;cience, in the church of Chri&s;t. As that, would be a reflection upon the kingly office of Chri&s;t, as tho' he had not given laws him&s;elf, &s;ufficient for the due regulation and government of his church and kingdom, or as tho' his laws, might be di&s;pen&s;ed with at plea&s;ure, by his &s;ub|jects. Such mu&s;t needs be ju&s;tly obnoxious, to that, his righteous rebuke. Luke 6.46. "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay." Such as would own Chri&s;t Je&s;us, for their Lord, mu&s;t &s;ubject their con&s;ciences, in all re&s;pects, without re|&s;erve, entirely to his authority in his word.&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="2">II. Of the nature of this body of Chri&s;t, the church, as to the &s;ubjects of which it doth con&s;i&s;t. And by the church is meant in the go&s;pel, in a more general &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="7" REF="011692_0006_0F87EBFB1D70AEA0">all the true members of Chri&s;t, even the whole num|ber of true believers, or all the elect of God, of what nation &s;oever, from the beginning to the end of the world. All which make up, but one my&s;tical body, of which Chri&s;t is the Head. This is plainly meant, by the church in our text. As al&s;o in Col. 1.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. "And he is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the beginning, the fir&s;t born from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence." In this &s;en&s;e, the church here in this world, is one body with that perfected in glory; according to that, Heb. 12.22, 23. "But ye are come unto Mount-Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeru&s;a|lem, and to an innumerable company of angels: to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born which are written in heaven." All true believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, belong to, and are the &s;ubjects of this one uni|ver&s;al church and kingdom of Chri&s;t; begun here in time and perfected in glory. "That he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf, a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing, but that it &s;hould be holy &amp; without blemi&s;h." Ep. 5.27. The&s;e, the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom, in this general &s;en&s;e, are not all joined toge|ther in any one vi&s;ible congregation here in this world. But in order to accompli&s;h his gracious purpo&s;e to|wards his church univer&s;al, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has ordained and appointed, that &s;uch as profe&s;s to receive him as their Lord and Saviour, be joined together, in particular wor&s;hipping congregations. To be each, as one vi&s;ible body; unitedly calling upon his Name, hearing his word, and partaking of his ordinances, and walking together as brethren, in that order and di&s;ci|pline which he hath appointed in his hou&s;e. And ac|cordingly the apo&s;tles, under the direction of Chri&s;t their Lord, did gather, &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h, the fir&s;t particular church at Jeru&s;alem; where the go&s;pel began to be preached, from whence the &s;ound thereof was to go forth into all the world: and other
<PB N="8" REF="011692_0007_0F87EBFBDD6F4B28">particular churches be gathered and &s;et up, after the pattern of that fir&s;t church at Jeru&s;alem. Which church, according to the apo&s;tolic account, plainly ap|pears, to have been made up of &s;uch, for the members thereof, as profe&s;&s;ed to believe in, and receive the apo&s;|tolic doctrine, concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Acts 2.41, &amp;c. "Then they that gladly received his word were bapti|&s;ed, and the &s;ame day, there were added unto them a|bout three thou&s;and &s;ouls. And they continued &s;ted|fa&s;t in the apo&s;tles doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And the Lord ad|ded to the church daily &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved." To that particular church at Jeru&s;alem were daily additi|ons made, of &s;uch as received the apo&s;tolic doctrine &amp; were bapti&s;ed with the go&s;pel bapti&s;m; joined together to hold fellow&s;hip in that doctrine, and in the breaking of bread, in the Lord's-&s;upper, and in prayers. And together with the&s;e, it &s;eems were joined their infant &s;eed, made members together with them of the &s;ame vi&s;ible body; and &s;o al&s;o partakers of bapti&s;m the ini|tiating &s;eal. As to the&s;e &s;ame per&s;ons, St. Peter &s;aid ju&s;t before, "For the promi&s;e is to you, and to your chil|dren." The&s;e, made not many, but one wor&s;hipping a&s;|&s;embly. "They were all with one accord in Solo|mon's porch." Acts 5.12. It was not, it may be ob|&s;erv'd, the apo&s;tles and elders, that were denominated the church; but more e&s;pecially the brethren, even in di&s;tinction from the apo&s;tles and elders; as appears from Acts 15.4. "They, (Paul and Barnabas) were received of the <HI>church,</HI> &amp; of the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> &amp; <HI>elders;"</HI> &amp; v. 22. Then plea&s;ed it the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>elders,</HI> with the whole <HI>church,</HI> to &s;end cho&s;en men," &amp;c. The <HI>brethren</HI> are here denominated the <HI>church;</HI> which appears to have had elders over them; be&s;ides the apo&s;tles, as officers in|ve&s;ted with a &s;pecial and extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion, extending even to the ends of the earth. And from the Acts of the apo&s;tles, it appears, that after the mo|del
<PB N="9" REF="011692_0008_0F87EBFC9D715A80">of the fir&s;t church at Jeru&s;alem, they actually ga|thered churches every where in every place, where a &s;ufficient number appeared to profe&s;s the go&s;pel faith, ordaining elders over every &s;uch particular church. For, upon the per&s;ecution that aro&s;e about Stephen, many were &s;catered abroad. And &s;ome of them going to An|tioch, "the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord; of whom a church was formed there, called the church at Antioch; to which Paul and Barnabas preached for a time. Act. 11.19. &amp;c. And from which al&s;o Paul and Barnabas were by the command of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ent forth to preach the go&s;pel among the Gentiles. Act. 13.1. &amp;c. Who accordingly went forth and preached; and returning again thro' tho&s;e places where their preaching had been &s;ucce&s;sful, 'they confirmed the &s;ouls of the di&s;ciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith; and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fa&s;ting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.' Act. 14.21. &amp;c. Thus having gathered and &s;et up particular churches in divers places, and completed their church &s;tate, by ordaining elders over them, they commend|ed them not to any &s;uperintending judicature, but to the Lord, on whom they believed. And thus every particular congregation, joined together to attend go&s;|pel wor&s;hip and ordinances in one place, is in the go&s;|pel called a church. And where there are numbers of &s;uch, of any province or kingdom, collectively &s;poken of, they are called churches. Thus we read of the church at Jeru&s;alem, of the church at Antioch, at Ephe|&s;us, &amp;c. meaning one particular wor&s;hiping congrega|tion. But of the churches of Judah, of A&s;ia, &amp;c. mean|ing the &s;everal particular congregations, which were in tho&s;e provinces. And neither is there any in&s;tance to be found in the new-te&s;tament, of the various par|ticular churches, thro' a whole province or kingdom,
<PB N="10" REF="011692_0009_0F87EBFD5D6D4F58">being collectively called the church of &s;uch a country; &s;uch as the church of Rome, the church of England, and the church of Scotland, &amp;c. meaning a great num|ber of particular a&s;&s;emblies, &s;ome how joined together, &s;o as to be but one church. And &s;o al&s;o, it does not ap|pear, that there were any bi&s;hops in the apo&s;tolic churches, that had the over&s;ight of a number of par|ticular churches; nor indeed any bi&s;hop at all, but &s;uch only, as were elders in &s;ome particular church. Agreeable to that, Acts 20.17. "And from Miletus, he (St. Paul) &s;ent to Ephe&s;us and called the elders of the church;" compared with ver. 28th. "Take heed there|fore unto your&s;elves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you over&s;eers, to feed the church of God." Over&s;eers, that is, epi&s;copous, the very word in the original, univer&s;ally u&s;ed in the new-te&s;tament for bi&s;hops. In&s;tead of one bi&s;hop, over &s;everal particular churches, there were &s;everal elders over that one particular church at Ephe&s;us. And all tho&s;e elders were over&s;eers; epi&s;copous, the true &s;crip|ture bi&s;hops, and &s;uch are all go&s;pel elders.</P>
<P>And, III. To the brethren of &s;uch particular church|es, with their own elder or elders over them, the exer|ci&s;e of all church di&s;cipline belongs. To &s;uch particu|lar churches, Chri&s;t has committed all that authority, which he hath given in the new-te&s;tament, for the con|tinued, &s;tanding di&s;cipline of his hou&s;e; to admit their own members, to receive complaints, to hear, try, judge, and deal with offenders; to re&s;tore the penitent, or to reject and ca&s;t off incorrigible offenders; as point|ed out, Mat. 18.15, &amp;c. "Moreover, if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault be|tween thee and him alone; if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
<PB N="11" REF="011692_0010_0F87EBFE1D6FCC10">church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I &s;ay unto you, what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven; and what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven." This is the ge|neral commi&s;&s;ion, and mo&s;t explicit direction, given by Chri&s;t, for the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline in his hou&s;e; which is plainly given as to a particular church, and applica|ble therefore to every &s;uch church. And what is here &s;aid, in this particular ver&s;e, is abundantly illu&s;trated, ratified, and confirmed, by the various declarations here and there &s;et forth in the new-te&s;tament relative to this matter. More particularly: From the elders of par|ticular churches, being &s;tiled rulers; as in 1 Tim. 5.17. "Let the elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour." And, Heb. 13.7. "Remember them that have the rule over you, who have &s;poken unto you the word of God." And, ver. 17. "Obey them that have the rule over you, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves, for they watch for your &s;ouls, as they that mu&s;t give account." Thus every elder, is by office, a ruler over the particular church of which he is elder. Be&s;ides whom, we read of no other &s;tanding rulers in the church of Chri&s;t. And yet, neither are they &s;et to rule as lords over God's heritage; but as en&s;amples to the flock. 1 Pet. 5.3. And con&s;equently to rule with the joint concurrence of their re&s;pective churches. Ac|cordingly particular directions are given, expre&s;sly to the brethren, about this matter. Rom. 16.17. "Now I be&s;eech you brethren, mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;i|ons and offences, contrary to the doctrines which ye have learned, and avoid them." And 2 The&s;. 3.6. "Now we command you brethren, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that ye withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly." Thus the bre|thren are called to mark, judge of, and avoid tho&s;e that walk di&s;orderly, and cau&s;e offences, contrary to the
<PB N="12" REF="011692_0011_0F87EBFEDD6BB148">apo&s;tolic doctrine. Agreeable to that, 1 Cor. 5.11. "But now I have written unto you not to keep com|pany, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with &s;uch an one no not to eat."</P>
<P>And thus the church of Chri&s;t at Corinth, acting by the apo&s;tles direction, as a particular church, did put away from among them&s;elves, the ince&s;tuous per&s;on; and after his repentance re&s;tored him again. 1 Cor. 5.13. "Put away from among you that wicked per&s;on." And, 2 Cor. 2.6, and 8. "Sufficient to &s;uch a man is the puni&s;hment which was inflicted of many. Where|fore I be&s;eech you, that ye would confirm your love towards him." Thus even St. Paul him&s;elf did not attempt authoritatively to re&s;tore him, whom the Co|rinthian church had put away from among them; and that not even after he had manife&s;ted repentance. "But be&s;eeches them to confirm their love to him." And if not St. Paul, who then among men, may in &s;uch ca&s;es, claim juridical authority over particular churches? Thus it is abundantly manife&s;t, that the whole autho|rity given by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the government, order, and di&s;cipline of his hou&s;e, is given to individual churches, to be ve&s;ted in them, and to be exerci&s;ed by them. And where Chri&s;t him&s;elf has placed this au|thority, there it mu&s;t abide; and cannot be given up by particular churches into any other hands, without betraying the tru&s;t which the Lord has committed unto them. Nor can any wre&s;t it out of their hands, with|out tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon the royal prerogative of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who mu&s;t reign till all his enemies are put under his feet.</P>
<P>It is doubtle&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, for particu|lar churches in different ca&s;es, to a&s;k advi&s;ory coun&s;el of neighbouring elders and churches. "As in the mul|titude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety." Prov. 11.14. And requi&s;ite al&s;o that elders be ordained by a pre&s;by|tery
<PB N="13" REF="011692_0012_0F87EBFF9D704910">of elders. 1 Tim. 4.14. "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophe&s;y, with the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery." Com|pared with 2 Tim. 2.2. "And the things which thou ha&s;t heard of me among many witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame com|mit thou to faithful men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o." But all ab&s;olute juridical &s;uperiority of any one man, or of any number of men, over &s;uch par|ticular churches, is plainly forbidden. Mat, 20.25. "But Je&s;us called them unto him, (his di&s;ciples, moved with indignation one at another, about which &s;hould be the greate&s;t) and &s;aid, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e dominion over them; and they that are great exerci&s;e authority upon them. But it &s;hall not be &s;o among you; but who&s;oever will be great among you, let him be your mini&s;ter. And who&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your &s;ervant." Compared with Mat. 23.8. "But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven. Nei|ther be ye called ma&s;ter; for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t. But he that is greate&s;t among you &s;hall be your &s;ervant." So that juridical authority, over individual churches, cannot be exerci&s;ed, by any one or more, without direct infringement upon the laws of the great Head and King of the church, who will not give his glory to another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There can be no ju&s;t pretence, to &s;o much as the plau&s;ible &s;hadow of one in&s;tance in the new-te&s;tament, of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;i&s;tory, &s;ynod, or council, for the countenance and &s;upport of tho&s;e of a modern form, excepting that in the 15th chapter of the Acts, about the circumci&s;ion of the Gentiles. A que&s;tion which Paul and Bar|nabas were &s;ent upon, from Antioch, to the apo&s;tles and elders at Jeru&s;alem: v. 1.2. "And they were received of the church, and of the apo&s;tles and elders." v. 4. "For the apo&s;tles and elders came to|gether to con&s;ider of this matter." v. 6. "Then plea&s;ed it the apo&s;|tles and elders, with the whole church, to &s;end cho&s;en men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas," (v. 22.) with this re&s;ult, "For it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things; that ye ab&s;tain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things &s;trangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep your&s;elves ye &s;hall do well." v. 28, 29.
<P>In all which there is no appearance of a &s;ynodical council; but only a meeting of the apo&s;tles and elders that were at Jeru&s;alem, to|gether with that whole church. For Paul and Barnabas were only me&s;&s;engers propo&s;ing the que&s;tion. And to whom could the deter|mination of &s;uch a que&s;tion of con&s;cience belong, but to the apo&s;|tles, who being divinely in&s;pired, could with propriety &s;ay, "It &s;eem|ed good to the holy Gho&s;t, and to us." Tho' they were plea&s;ed to take the concurrence of the elders, with the whole church at Jeru|&s;alem.</P>
<P>But how utterly vain the pretence of unin&s;pired men, to any &s;uch kind of authority, to &s;et forth injunctions, binding upon the con|&s;cience?</P></NOTE></P>

And if now we &s;hould take a view of &s;ome of the various forms of church government, e&s;tabli&s;hed among profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians; you may perhaps be better able to judge for your&s;elves, whether there be not in many re&s;pects, a very &s;ad deviation from the laws of Chri&s;t. And to begin neare&s;t home. In tho&s;e that are called the con&s;ociated churches, the manner of di&s;ciplining offenders, is allowed to begin with, and to be proceed|ed in by, particular churches, even unto excommuni|cation, agreeable to the &s;criptures. But then in&s;tead of the matters re&s;ting there, where the &s;criptures plainly re&s;t it; the excommunicated per&s;on may apply to the con&s;ociation; who, if they &s;ee cau&s;e, may hear the ca&s;e, and order the church to receive &s;uch excommuni|cated per&s;on again to their communion, and that on pain of &s;candalous contempt, however unanimou&s;ly the church might be agreed as to the evidence of his guilt. And in&s;tances of &s;uch a kind there actually have been. Be&s;ides, &s;uch councils called to act con&s;ti|tutionally, do act not advi&s;orily, but juridically, giving a deci&s;ive judgment to be ab&s;olutely binding upon the church, and all the parties concerned; which I hum|bly conceive to be really a&s;ide from, and even contrary to, the laws of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011692_0014_0F87EC011D6A6928">
As to the churches called pre&s;byterian, or of the church of Scotland: according to that con&s;titution, the common brethren of the church have little to do in matters of church di&s;cipline. Their mini&s;ters, with their ruling elders, make a &s;ort of juridical board, be|fore whom lies the fir&s;t hearing of all matters of com|mon di&s;cipline; from whom appeals lie to their pre&s;|byteries; as al&s;o from the pre&s;byteries to provincial &s;ynods; and from thence to the general a&s;&s;embly, com|po&s;ed of delegates from all the pre&s;byteries or &s;ynods in the nation. In whom lies the final deci&s;ion of all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical differences. So far, according to that con&s;tituti|on, is deci&s;ive authority removed from particular churches. In the con&s;ociated churches it is removed; but as it were one &s;tep, up to a con&s;ociated council. But in the church of Scotland, it is removed by various ri&s;ing degrees, up to a general a&s;&s;embly of eccle&s;ia&s;tical delegates.</P>
<P>And &s;o al&s;o, according to the con&s;titution of the church of England, the common brethren of particular churches have nothing at all to do in matters of di&s;ci|pline; nor even the mini&s;ters of particular churches, farther than &s;pecified in the rubrick, under the order for the admini&s;tration of the Lord's-&s;upper. "That the curate having knowledge of any of the communicants, that they are notorious evil-doers, &s;hall adverti&s;e &s;uch, that in any wi&s;e they pre&s;ume not to come to the Lord's table, until they have openly declared them&s;elves truly to have repented," &amp;c. "Provided, that every mini&s;ter &s;o repelling any, &s;hall be obliged to give an account of the &s;ame to the ordinary, within fourteen days after, at the farthe&s;t." Here the brethren have no hand in this di&s;cipline. The curate alone repels offenders; which yet, he is allowed to do, but only for fourteen days; within which time, he is obliged to give an account thereof to the ordinary, that is, to the bi&s;hop or arch deacon. "And the ordinary," as &s;aid in the rubrick,
<PB N="16" REF="011692_0015_0F87EC01DD6A2E90">"&s;hall proceed again&s;t the offending per&s;on, according to the canon." By which canon is not doubtle&s;s meant the law of Chri&s;t. But the canon law of the church of England, taken chiefly, if not intirely, from the canon law of the church of Rome. But &s;till, the arch bi&s;hop's court is &s;uperior to that of the ordinary's; even as in the church of Rome, the pope in his conclave of cardi|nals, is &s;upreme over all other eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatures. And whether &s;uch methods of church di&s;cipline be not manife&s;tly contrary to the laws of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I freely &s;ubmit to you my hearers to judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>One &s;pecial rea&s;on of &s;uch national kind of hierarchies, or national forms of church government, &s;eems to be taken from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Jewi&s;h church and kingdom was de&s;igned to be a &s;ort of pattern for nati|onal churches under the go&s;pel. The kings of I&s;rael were &s;upreme in all matters both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical. And in that church there was one high prie&s;t, chief over numbers of prie&s;ts of a lower order; all which were &s;uperior to the Levites appointed to lower kinds of &s;ervices.</P>
<P>In imitation of which, the church of Rome hath one high prie&s;t, &s;et up in the pope's office, to be &s;upreme over all eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, with a multiplied grada|tion of prie&s;tly orders under him. And &s;o al&s;o in imi|tation of the kings of I&s;rael, the kings of Great-Britain are deemed by the church of England, the &s;upreme head thereof; and their eccle&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy aimed to be modeled, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, after that of the Jewi&s;h church. As indeed the very notion of all national, religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;eems to be derived very much from the &s;ame &s;ource, the national e&s;tabli&s;hment of re|ligion in the Jewi&s;h kingdom of old. All which pat|terns of imitation, derived from the Jewi&s;h to the Chri&s;|tian church, appear to be quite groundle&s;s. If it be con&s;idered, that the Jewi&s;h &s;tate was a type and &s;hadow of &s;piritual and heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ly things in and by the promi&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="011692_0016_0F87EC029D740618">Me&s;&s;iah; that their kings were typical of Chri&s;t in his kingly office; their high prie&s;ts typical of the high prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t; as all their various offerings were, of the great &s;acrifice which Chri&s;t offered of him&s;elf; and even as the earthly was a type of the heavenly Ca|naan. All which, being types and &s;hadows of Chri&s;t and heavenly things, were therefore aboli&s;hed and done away by the coming of Chri&s;t, the &s;ub&s;tance, as abun|dantly &s;et forth in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews.</P>
<P>Or &s;hould it be thought a wi&s;e device, to have men of learning and &s;uperior abilities &s;elected to be judges in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters: What device then could be wi&s;er, than to have the mo&s;t learned in a nation, &s;uch as bi&s;hops and arch-bi&s;hops are &s;uppo&s;ed to be, for judges in &s;uch matters? But how much more wonder|fully wi&s;e then &s;till, is the Romi&s;h device, of &s;etting up the very wi&s;e&s;t of all, endowed with a &s;pirit of infallibi|lity, to be &s;upreme judge over all? But the truth is, human policy has no right to devi&s;e any thing at all about church government, different from what the great Head of the church hath appointed. Authority to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline mu&s;t re&s;t in the hands of tho&s;e to whom Chri&s;t him&s;elf has committed it, even in every particular church. In regard to which, it concerns the churches to &s;ee to it, that they &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made them free. In civil mat|ters, men are commonly wont to account the privilege of being judged by a jury of equals, e&s;&s;ential to their liberty. And &s;o in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, the privilege of judging and being judged as equals in a particular church, is ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed e&s;&s;ential to go&s;pel li|berty, in regard to the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's church and kingdom. Re&s;pecting which, as exerci&s;ed by indivi|dual churches, is that, Mat. 18.18. "Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven; and what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven:" That is, be approved
<PB N="18" REF="011692_0017_0F87EC035D660810">of, ratified, and confirmed by Chri&s;t the Head. Which di&s;cipline is to be proceeded in with a &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s, and readine&s;s to forgive, in a &s;en&s;e of our own need of forgivene&s;s. Mat. 18.5, 6. "Who&s;o &s;hall receive one &s;uch little child in my name, receiveth me; but who&s;o &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the &s;ea." Compared with ver. 35. "So likewi&s;e &s;hall my heavenly Father do al&s;o unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." So that where due regard is had to the laws of Chri&s;t, there will be no tyrannical lording of it over any. But while there is a forward|ne&s;s to forgive the penitent, there will be a &s;teady and un&s;haken fortitude to reject ob&s;tinate offenders.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;pecial ends de&s;igned by &s;uch di&s;cipline, is the good of offenders, the maintenance of brother|ly love, the honour of Chri&s;t, and that his church may enjoy his promi&s;ed pre&s;ence with them. One &s;pecial end de&s;igned, is the good of offenders, that they may be convicted, humbled, and reclaimed; "That the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us." 1 Cor. 5.5. Offenders therefore are to be di&s;ciplined, even in regard to their own good.</P>
<P>Another end thereby de&s;igned, is to maintain that brotherly love which the go&s;pel requires. Chri&s;tian brethren are enjoined, "above all things, to have fer|vent charity among them&s;elves." 1 Pet. 4.8. But there can be no grounds for &s;uch fervent charity, farther than they appear to one another, to be truly conformed to Chri&s;t. Such therefore as conduct incon&s;i&s;tent with the chri&s;tian character, mu&s;t either be reclaimed or be ca&s;t out; that &s;uch as do partake together as brethren, in the &s;piritual ordinances of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, may have fervent charity among them&s;elves. So that it is utter|ly incon&s;i&s;tent with that brotherly love, which the go&s;|pel
<PB N="19" REF="011692_0018_0F87EC041D668128">requires, to hold communion with an offending brother, without taking go&s;pel mea&s;ures to reclaim him. Which di&s;cipline, is al&s;o for the honor of Chri&s;t, of his church and name in the world. For by this, &s;aid Je&s;us, "&s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples if ye have love one to another." John 13.35. In re|&s;pect therefore to &s;uch as do not appear, to be fit objects of this peculiar love, but unworthy to rank with Chri&s;t's members; it is &s;aid, "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleaven|ed, for even Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;over is &s;acrificed for us." 1 Cor. 5.7. "For we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." 1 Cor. 10.17. And it mu&s;t &s;urely be vilely di&s;|honoring to Chri&s;t the head, for his body, the church, to admit openly profane members, to partake with them of that one bread, as members together of his one body. And &s;o al&s;o to maintain the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e according to his appointment, is requi&s;ite to en|joy his promi&s;ed pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing. As Chri&s;t's promi&s;ed pre&s;ence with his church, is to be expected, only while they walk in his ways, keep his command|ments, and attend the orders of his hou&s;e. "For if ye love me, keep my commandments," &s;aid Je&s;us, "and I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you a|nother comforter, that he may abide with you forever. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, &s;hall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will ma|nife&s;t my &s;elf unto him." John 14.15, &amp;c. "For, if ye keep my commandments, ye &s;hall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." John 15.10. Which has re&s;pect to all Chri&s;t's commandments, even to &s;uch as regard the order and di&s;cipline of his hou&s;e, as well as to others. Therefore without the due ob&s;ervation thereof, his &s;pe|cial pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing, is not to be expected. But
<PB N="20" REF="011692_0019_0F87EC04DD694818">rather the woes which he hath denounced again&s;t &s;uch as &s;werve from the faith and order of his hou&s;e. As he &s;aid, "Remember therefore how thou ha&s;t received and heard, and hold fa&s;t and repent; if therefore thou &s;hall not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou &s;hall not know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hour I will come upon thee." Rev. 3.3.</P>
<P>Hence then may be infered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is a matter of great importance, that churches take earne&s;t heed, to attend to, and ob&s;erve, that order and di&s;cipline in Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, which he him&s;elf hath ordained and pointed out in his word. The peculiar characteri&s;tic of churches, originates ve|ry much from this their manner and form of di&s;cipline. And as Chri&s;t &s;aid to certain Jews, profe&s;&s;ing to believe in him, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed." John 8.31. i. e. If we walk ac|cording to my word, then will ye appear to be my di&s;|ciples in truth. So doubtle&s;s may it with ju&s;t propri|ety be &s;aid of churches profe&s;&s;ing the faith of Chri&s;t. If they attend to, and ob&s;erve the orders which he hath appointed in his hou&s;e, then do they appear to be his churches in truth. Not but that, as in particular be|lievers, there may be many imperfections, con&s;i&s;tent with their being true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; &s;o there may doubtle&s;s be much imperfection in the order of church|es, con&s;i&s;tent with their being true churches of Chri&s;t. And altho' to draw a line preci&s;ely betwixt &s;uch as may, and &s;uch as cannot be true churches of Chri&s;t, may not belong to fallible men to attempt; yet every one have a right to judge for them&s;elves about the&s;e matters; and all had need to be fully per&s;uaded in their own minds, as to their own practice, &s;o far as to con&s;ort and walk together with &s;uch churches, as appear to them on the whole, mo&s;t nearly conformable to the faith and order of the go&s;pel. And yet &s;till it is an undoubted truth, that churches profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian faith, do &s;o far only appear to be the true churches of
<PB N="21" REF="011692_0020_0F87EC059D63C9D8">Chri&s;t, as they appear to walk after the order which he hath pre&s;cribed in his word. Therefore it highly con|cerns every church, as they would approve them&s;elves a true church of Chri&s;t, to &s;ee to it that they attend to the mind and will of Chri&s;t, revealed in his word, re|&s;pecting the order and di&s;cipline of his hou&s;e, and that they cordially embrace, and &s;tedfa&s;tly adhere thereun|to; even in this re&s;pect, as well as in every other, cheerfully bearing the cro&s;s after Chri&s;t, that living to him as their &s;overeign Lord and King, they may reign with him in the kingdom of his glory.&mdash;And hence then,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Be exhorted my brethren, to &s;ee to it with ut|mo&s;t care and diligence, that ye walk together in the true faith and order of the go&s;pel. That ye &s;ubmit your&s;elves to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as &s;ole king and lawgiver in Sion. That you attend to his will, &s;et forth in his word, as the only rule of faith and practice; admitting no other rule in matters pertaining to the con&s;cience, but &s;ubmiting your&s;elves intirely to the authority of Chri&s;t in his word; that abiding &s;tedfa&s;tly therein, you may appear to be a true church of Chri&s;t indeed. And take earne&s;t heed to your&s;elves per&s;o|nally, to conduct every one in particular, as becomes the members of Chri&s;t's body, holy in all manner of life and conver&s;ation, even as he that hath called you is holy; carefully &s;huning all the evil ways of this wicked world, even all covetous and injurious practi|ces; all bitter and envious pa&s;&s;ions, all defaming, rail|ing and backbiting; all intemperate and unclean in|dulgencies, and all lewd and profane company, and all vile and filthy conver&s;ation. Be on your guard again&s;t the &s;in that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets you. And &s;trive earne&s;t|ly after growth and increa&s;e in every chri&s;tian grace and vertue. That ye may approve your&s;elves to be the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t in truth. And recommend your &s;elves to the fervent charity of your chri&s;tian brethren.
<PB N="22" REF="011692_0021_0F87EC065D65B220">And &s;ee to it, that you act the part of true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t towards others. That you watch over your children, whom you have brought with you and given up to the Lord. That you faithfully train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; in&s;truct|ing, coun&s;elling, warning and reproving them; that be|ing trained up in the way in which they &s;hould go, they may not depart from it.</P>
<P>And take heed al&s;o as chri&s;tian brethren, to watch over exhort and admoni&s;h one another. Suffer not &s;in upon thy brother, but if he &s;in, rebuke him. "Breth|ren, &s;aid the apo&s;tle, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are &s;piritual re&s;tore &s;uch an one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con&s;idering thy&s;elf le&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t. And be ye kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven you." But from incorrigible offenders, be careful to withdraw your&s;elves, and to put them away from among you. That you may appear to be, as becomes the body of Chri&s;t, knit together in love, and filled with all his fullne&s;s, to the everla&s;ting prai&s;e of his glorious grace.</P>
