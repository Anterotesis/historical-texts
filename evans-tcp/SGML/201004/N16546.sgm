<HEAD>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you did me the honour to elect me into the Convention, to decide for you upon the con&s;titution &s;ubmitted to the &s;tates from Philadelphia, I had not at that time examined it with that attention its importance required, and of cour&s;e could give you no decided opinion re&s;pecting it. Other cares had unavoidably taken my attention from it. After you had repo&s;ed that tru&s;t in me it became my duty to pay it a more &s;erious attention. Having given it the be&s;t inve&s;tigation that my limited capacity is capable of, and perhaps formed in &s;ome mea&s;ure my opinion re&s;pecting it, &s;ubject however to alteration when I &s;hall be convinced that I am in an er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or, I &s;hould think my&s;elf unpardonable if I witheld it from you. To you it belongs to approve or correct this opinion, for although it would give me pain to be compelled to take a cour&s;e which my own mind did not approve, yet I have too high a re&s;pect for your rights, too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of my duty, and too &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion of gratitude for the confidence you have repo&s;ed in me, to act contrary to your wi&s;hes. Under this impre&s;&s;ion I have thought proper to make to you the following unre&s;erved communication of my &s;entiments upon this all important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It will readily occur to you that this plan of government is not &s;ubmitted for your deci&s;ion in an ordinary way; not to one branch of the government in its legi&s;lative character and con|fined under the con&s;titution to the &s;phere it has a&s;&s;igned it; but to the people to whom it be|longs and from whom all power originates, in convention a&s;&s;embled. In this &s;ituation your pre&s;ent &s;tate con&s;titution was, or &s;hould have been, formed, and in this &s;ituation you are of cour&s;e able to alter, or change it at plea&s;ure. You are therefore to ob&s;erve that whatever act you now enter into, will be paramount to all others either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f law or con&s;titution, and that in adopting this it becomes in reality the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, and binding on you as &s;uch. Whether it will ab&s;olutely annul and do away that of the &s;tate is perhaps doubtful; my own
<PB N="4" REF="021263_0002_0FB2B7AB9EABE208">
apprehen&s;ion is it will not, except in tho&s;e ca&s;es wherein they di&s;agree; in the&s;e it will of cour&s;e prevail, and controul all the departments of the &s;tate government, being the ulterior act of the people. You will therefore perceive it is a &s;ubject of great extent and importance upon which you have to decide, and that you owe it to your country, your&s;elves, and po&s;terity, that it be well examined in all its con&s;equences before it is determined.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the cau&s;es that might probably have contributed to make it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to your deci&s;ion the propriety of &s;uch a change in your political &s;ituation, we are naturally led into one of the following conclu&s;ions&mdash;either that the morals of the people have become corrupted&mdash;that the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind by nature render them unfit for the enjoy|ment of equal liberty, or that the form of the government it&s;elf under which we live is radi|cally defective, and capable of &s;uch improvement, as will extend to us its ble&s;&s;ings in a higher degree, and make them of longer duration. Believing firmly that the body of the people are virtuous, at lea&s;t &s;ufficiently &s;o to bear a free government; that it was the de&s;ign of their Creator in forming &s;uch an order of beings that they &s;hould enjoy it, and that it is only by a &s;trange and unaccountable perver&s;ion of his benevolent intentions to mankind, that they are ever deprived of it, I will proceed to examine the latter hypothe&s;is which &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch defects in the pre&s;ent form, as to make a change advi&s;eable. If we find that they really do exi&s;t, I will then proceed to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch remedies as will enable us comparitively to determine on the merits of that propo&s;ed to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead. I feel my&s;elf deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of this undertaking and am too well acquainted with my own inability, even to hope that I &s;hall conduct my&s;elf with propriety through it, but from a &s;incere de&s;ire to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a perfect good under&s;tanding between us, and prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any future anx|iety on this &s;ubject, I find my&s;elf con&s;trained however painful it may be, and however un|gracefully I may do it, not only to avow my &s;entiments re&s;pecting it, but the principles on which they are founded.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tates were &s;eparate, from their fir&s;t colonical e&s;tabli&s;hments until the encroach|ments of Great Britain, compelled them into an union for their defence. But as their com|bined efforts &s;oon promi&s;ed to erect them into independent governments, the con&s;ideration which had united them for a time, and for the accompli&s;hment of one object only, became perpetual, and the wi&s;dom of their councils &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of provi&s;ions that would &s;ecure them from like dangers for ever&mdash;under this impre&s;&s;ion they entered into the articles of confe|deration on the&mdash;day of&mdash;, 178. To this in&s;trument or bond of union there|fore we are to look for the &s;trength, or imbecility, for the perfection or demerits, of the pre|&s;ent foederal government. As this is the &s;y&s;tem who&s;e defects we have to remedy, it will be proper to pre&s;ent to your view conci&s;ely a &s;ummary of its powers.</P>
<P>The powers which have been given by the&s;e articles of agreement or confederation to the general government are exten&s;ive. They are to be found principally in the 9th and the 6th articles, in the former po&s;itively, and in the latter negatively by a qualification of the rights of the individual &s;tates. By the 9th, the United States are authori&s;ed to make war and peace&mdash;&s;end and receive amba&s;&s;adors&mdash;enter into treaties with alliances, provided that no treaty of com|merce &s;hall be made whereby the legi&s;lature of the re&s;pective &s;tates &s;hall be re&s;trained from impo&s;ing &s;uch duties on foreigners as their own people are &s;ubject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any &s;pecies of goods or commodities what&s;oever&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;hing rules for deciding what captures &s;hall be legal by land and water, and how appropriated; grant

letters of marque and repri&s;al in time of peace&mdash;appoint courts for determining finally in all ca&s;es of captures; appoint courts for the deci&s;ion of territorial controver&s;ies between &s;tates and individuals claiming lands under different grants from two or more &s;tates, who&s;e juri&s;dictions re&s;pecting &s;uch lands have already been adju&s;ted by the &s;aid court;&mdash;coin and regulate exclu|&s;ively the value of coin throughout the United States&mdash;fix the &s;tandard of weights and mea&s;ures &mdash;regulate the trade with the Indians not members of a particular &s;tate&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;h and regulate po&s;t-offices&mdash;appoint all officers of land and &s;ea forces, except regimental; make rules for their government and regulation and direct their operations&mdash;a&s;certain the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums of money to be rai&s;ed for the &s;ervice of the United States appropriate, and apply the &s;ame&mdash;borrow money and emit bills of credit on the faith of the United States&mdash;build and equip a navy&mdash;agree on the number of land forces and make requi&s;itions for the &s;ame. Provided that none of the &s;aid powers &s;hall be exerci&s;ed without the con&s;ent of nine &s;tates. By the 6th, the individual &s;tates are prohibited from &s;ending or receiving emba&s;&s;ies, entering into conferences, treaties or alliances with any foreign power, and the &s;ervants of the United States or individual &s;tates from holding offices of profit or tru&s;t under any foreign prince or potentate whatever&mdash;from partial confederacies without con&s;ent of Congre&s;s&mdash;from keeping up troops or ve&s;&s;els of war in time of peace except &s;uch as &s;hall be approved by Congre&s;s&mdash;entering into a war with a foreign power unle&s;s invaded by an enemy&mdash;from granting letters of marque or repri&s;al except after declaration of war by the United States and then under particular re&s;trictions only.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles give all the efficient powers to the United States&mdash;The 1&s;t, 3d, 4th, 7th and 8th, although they e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome fundamental principles on which the government is to move, and e&s;pecially the 8th the rule of apportionment, yet they give no real power; they are rather the rule by which the power already given is to be u&s;ed than that they give any them&s;elves. The 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th, fall &s;till more under this exception or regulate other inferior objects of compact. But the 2d and 5th are of a different impre&s;&s;ion. By the former, each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom and independence, and every power, juri&s;diction and right, not expre&s;sly delegated to the United States and by the latter, that of appointing, continuing, or removing its own delegates at plea&s;ure. The&s;e are the powers, and this the form, of the pre&s;ent government.</P>
<P>An attentive view of the &s;ubject will &s;atisfy us that the&s;e powers are really great and exten|&s;ive; they appear to have contemplated the greater part of tho&s;e concerns wherein it might be &s;uppo&s;ed they had a national intere&s;t. Having made the United States the &s;overeign arbiters of war and peace, given them the right to require men and money, equip fleets and armies, to &s;end and receive amba&s;&s;adors, make treaties of alliance and commerce, with the very exten&s;ive catalogue which I have already enumerated, except the regulation of trade there &s;eemed to be little left of external policy to the individual &s;tates. It is not my object to inquire here whether the&s;e powers &s;hould be more exten&s;ive. I may in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations; at pre&s;ent I &s;hall examine more particularly the effect or operation of a government organi&s;ed like this.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that by the 2d article the individual &s;tates retain their re&s;pective &s;ove|reignties, juri&s;dictions and rights in all ca&s;es not expre&s;sly ceded to the confederacy. And by the 5th they re&s;erve the right of oppointing, continuing or removing their re&s;pective delegati|ons at plea&s;ure. To the&s;e articles we are to look for the tone and character of this government, for upon the&s;e does its good or bad qualities depend. It is upon this point, that the pre&s;ent commotion hath taken place in America, and upon the merits of which we have to decide.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021263_0004_0FB2B7B0126F5088">The deputies from each &s;tate being amenable for their conduct, and depending on it for their hopes and pro&s;pects, nece&s;&s;arily negociate for its intere&s;ts. This property or di&s;tinction pervades the whole body, and thus their general council or the Congre&s;s becomes a deploma|tick corps, or a corps formed of mini&s;ters or repre&s;entatives from &s;overeign &s;tates acting for the particular advantage of that to which they belong. The efforts therefore of each &s;tate, whatever may be the powers of the union over the &s;everal members that compo&s;e it, will be to &s;hield it&s;elf from the common burdens of the government; and to effect this all the arts of intrigue and negociation will be con&s;tantly exerted. What is the obvious cour&s;e of a govern|ment organi&s;ed on &s;uch principles? Are not the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution deeply ingrafted in it? The mo&s;t powerful principles of human action the hope of reward and the fear of puni&s;hment are in the hands of each &s;tate, and whil&s;t mankind are &s;ubject to their influence, or the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the human heart continue as they have been, its cour&s;e will always be the &s;ame. This government it is manife&s;t can never be an efficient one. Strong nece&s;&s;ity and emminent danger may make it &s;o occa&s;ionally, but whenever this cau&s;e cea&s;es to operate, its repellent principles will prevail. If this po&s;ition is ju&s;t, I am perhaps right in &s;uppo&s;ing it a con&s;equence nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from it, that the &s;tronger the powers of the government are, the more repellent will its qualities be, and the &s;ooner its di&s;&s;olution; at lea&s;t certain it is that the conflict between the general and &s;tate governments, will be proportionally more violent, and its or their ruin the &s;ooner accompli&s;hed, for it mu&s;t &s;oon terminate either in that of the one or the other, I mean as an efficient government. The higher toned tho&s;e of the &s;tates were the more rapid would the progre&s;s be. I think I may venture to affirm that a confederacy formed of principalities would not la&s;t long, for the pride of princes would not brook tho&s;e familiarities and in&s;ults which a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of rights and intere&s;ts, e&s;pecially if they interfere, &s;ometimes unavoidably occa&s;ions; and when an ab&s;olute prince takes offence he wields the &s;tate with him. But this is not the ca&s;e with democracies, for although their chief magi&s;|trates may be offended, yet it is difficult for them to communicate at the &s;ame time, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;po&s;itions to the whole community which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s. This is a caution however which I hope it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ugge&s;t here, for I am &s;atisfied the &s;tate governments will never take this turn of them&s;elves, nor whil&s;t that of the confederacy is pre&s;erved and properly &s;upported. But to carry this government a little further into practice.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ubmit the concerns and intere&s;ts of different &s;tates or individuals within them to this corps formed of repre&s;entatives from each negociating for that to which they re&s;pectively belong, and what kind of ju&s;tice may we expect from its deci&s;ions? If magazines were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed or troops rai&s;ed and &s;tationed in &s;ome quarter of the union for public defence, might we not expect that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e arrangments would take &s;tronger byas, from the combination of the day, than any &s;entiment of propriety? It &s;tates or individuals within them had claims founded on the &s;ame principles with tho&s;e upon which a deci&s;ion had already been had in fa|vour of others, are we to calculate with certainty upon a &s;imilar decree? In &s;hort apply it to every ca&s;e that may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e, either of &s;tates or individuals, in the full &s;cope of its powers, and we &s;hall find its deci&s;ions depend, more upon negociation, the bargain of the day, than any e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of ju&s;tice or policy.</P>
<P>On the other hand how are its treaties, laws, or ordinances to be carried into effect? Are they of authority and in force immediately within the &s;tates as &s;oon as they are pa&s;&s;ed? Or does it require the intervention of a &s;tate law to give them validity? And if the law is nece&s;|&s;ary may not the &s;tate refu&s;e to pa&s;s it, and if &s;he does how &s;hall &s;he be compelled? It is well
<PB N="7" REF="021263_0005_0FB2B7B1812CFEB0" MS="y">
known from the practice of all the &s;tates in the confederacy that no act of Congre&s;s, of what nature &s;oever it may be, is of force within them, until it is recognized by their own legi&s;la|tures, prior to that event it is a nullity, and to that only does it owe its authority. This view of the &s;ubject demon&s;trates clearly that the pre&s;ent government, in its ordinary admini&s;tration, though a league of independent &s;tates for common good, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive powers, mu&s;t always be void of energy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in its operation, &s;ometimes oppre&s;&s;ive, and often altoge|ther &s;u&s;pended&mdash;that it can never be calculated on by foreign powers, and of cour&s;e that they will form no treaties or compacts whatever with it, that &s;tipulate any thing, at lea&s;t on equal terms, that in fine very little dependence can be placed in it by the &s;tates them&s;elves, for de&s;|titute of the power of coercion, to &s;ay nothing as to the ju&s;tice or propriety of the mea&s;ures them&s;elves, the&s;e will not be forward to comply with its demands, whil&s;t tho&s;e may refu&s;e with impunity. On the other hand the illu&s;trious event which hath placed them in the rank of independent &s;tates demon&s;trates with equal certainty, that it is competent to external de|fence, and perfect &s;ecurity from abroad, for how otherwi&s;e could it have been atchieved? The&s;e are the defects or the principal defects of the pre&s;ent government, and they are in&s;epa|rable from a league of independent &s;tates, for to that circum&s;tance, and that alone they are to be attributed. We have then to weigh the&s;e evils, and compare them with the probable be|nefits and dangers that may accompany a change, and then &s;ee in which &s;cale the balance preporderates.</P>
<P>It may be now a&s;ked are we reduced to this alternative either to &s;ubvert the &s;tate &s;overeign|ties or &s;ubmit to the&s;e evils? Is the &s;tate &s;overeignty a vain and illu&s;ory hope, is it incompati|ble with its own and the general intere&s;ts of the confederacy? Or is there any other alterna|tive? The practice of nations and the field of enquiry is open before us, and we have every thing that is &s;acred and dear to mankind depending on the event. Two &s;pecies of remedy only pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind, and the&s;e contemplate either a complete annihilation of the &s;tate governments, or a partial one or con&s;iderable reduction of their powers. A complete annihilation and the organization of a general government over the whole, would unque&s;tion|ably remove all the objections which have been &s;tated above, and apply to it as a foederal go|vernment; and I will be free to own that if it were in reality a practicable thing, there is no object which my mind has ever contemplated, the attainment of which would give it &s;uch high gratification. To collect the citizens of America, who have fought and bled together, by who&s;e joint and common efforts they have been rai&s;ed to the comparitively happy and exalted theatre on which they now &s;tand; to lay a&s;ide all tho&s;e jarring intere&s;ts and di&s;cordant princi|ples, which &s;tate legi&s;latures if they do not create, certainly &s;oment and increa&s;e, arrange them under one government and make them one people, is an idea not only elevated and &s;ublime, but equally benevolent and humane. Whether it contains within it a territory as exten&s;ive as the Ru&s;&s;ian or German empires, or is confined in its operation to the narrow &s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of their &s;malle&s;t principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lities or provinces, yet it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate legi&s;lation to pur&s;ue its de&s;tined cour&s;e "the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who live under it." For a legi&s;lature to contemplate other ob|jects, and make a &s;acrifice of their own for the good of other people, or even decline availing it&s;elf of the legitimate exerci&s;e of its powers for that purpo&s;e, upon every opportunity which chance or fortune may pre&s;ent in its way, is a degree of liberality to which the human heart hath not as yet attained. A &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers of the antient &s;toi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k &s;ect might perhaps be capable of &s;uch extended philanthropy, but this &s;ect is now altogether at an end, and at its height, never formed but an incon&s;iderable part of any community, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by all the re&s;t of the world con&s;idered as affecting objects without the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of human nature. How much more
<PB N="8" REF="021263_0006_0FB2B7B58F06B9B8">
delightful therefore is it to the mind to contemplate one legi&s;lature organized over the whole continent, cantaining all the free inhabitants of the American &s;tates within it, nouri&s;hing, protecting, and promoting their intere&s;ts in every line and extending its genial influence to every part; commerce flouri&s;hing, arts encrea&s;ing, lands ri&s;ing in value, with all tho&s;e other happy concomitants that attend a well formed and wi&s;ely directed government, than thirteen different legi&s;latures, in pur&s;uit of local objects, acting upon partial and confined c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;iderati|ons, without &s;y&s;tem or policy, jealous of their particular rights, di&s;&s;atisfied with, and preying upon each other. If it were practicable, I &s;hould embrace this change with the utmo&s;t plea|&s;ure, and con&s;ider it the goal at which all our efforts &s;hould bend, the polar &s;tar that &s;hould di|rect all our movements. I &s;hould con&s;ider the abolition of the &s;tate legi&s;latures as a mo&s;t for|tunate event for America, and congratulate my country on the commencement of a new aera in her affairs from whence to date the dawn of better hopes and happier days. But is it prac|ticable, can it be accompli&s;hed?

Would it be po&s;&s;ible to form in every re&s;pect a complete con&s;olidation of intere&s;t and how otherwi&s;e would its operation affect the weaker party?

an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. In but few in&s;tances, and tho&s;e at di&s;tant in|tervals of time, hath a democracy or government of the people ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed. To what cau&s;e it is to be attributed, philo&s;ophers and &s;tate&s;men may differ, but it is an unque&s;|tionable truth, that there hath been a con&s;tant effort in all &s;ocieties, to exterpate it from off the face of the earth. The conte&s;t hath been often violent, and the manly exertions which the friends of equal liberty, have made again&s;t this di&s;ea&s;e of human nature, is the great, the in&s;tructive &s;ubject of hi&s;tory. They have had to contend again&s;t difficulties thrown in their way by all ranks of &s;ociety: If the poor and tho&s;e in moderate circum&s;tances only, where an union might have been e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pected had united, a tyranny had never been erected. But the igno|rance, the folly, and often times the vices of the lower cla&s;&s;es have perhaps favoured this tendency as &s;trongly as the lu&s;t for dominion and power in the wealthy. To illu&s;trate this po&s;ition by a review of the commencement, progre&s;s, and decline of tho&s;e nations with which hi&s;tory fur|ni&s;hes us examples, with the cau&s;es that have contributed to hurry them to this their la&s;t &s;tage, would not only pre&s;ent to your view a melancholy monument of the weakne&s;s of human in&s;ti|tutions, but lead me beyond the bounds of the pre&s;ent enquiry. Be a&s;&s;ured however there is no fact better e&s;tabli&s;hed by hi&s;tory, than this tendency or effort in all &s;ocieties, to defeat the purpo&s;e of their own in&s;titution, and terminate in de&s;poti&s;m. If then we are not the unfaithful guardians of tho&s;e rights, which an all gracious providence hath be&s;towed upon us, &s;hould we not attend to every circum&s;tance that may contribute to pre&s;erve them? And will it be que&s;|tioned, that the extent of territory is one of tho&s;e that will have no influence on the &s;ubject? The governments that have been purely democratic, to which only we &s;hould re&s;ort for &s;atisfactory information upon this head, if any ever were, are but few. In &s;everal it is true the people have had &s;ome &s;hare of power, as in that of Rome. But it cannot be que&s;tioned that in this the Nobles or ari&s;tocracy had the prevailing influence. The endle&s;s quarrels between the different branches or rather orders of the people, the Senate and plebians, is perhaps the real cau&s;e of the perpetual warfare and exten&s;ive conque&s;ts, made by this rapacious mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. When the people became incen&s;ed again&s;t the Senate, as they often had rea&s;on to be, the latter had always &s;ufficient addre&s;s, to give their pa&s;&s;ions other objects to act on, by turning them again&s;t foreign powers. With this view it &s;eems to have been a political maxim with that branch, in who&s;e hands the executive authority was al&s;o lodged, never to be at peace with all nations at the &s;ame time, and in this they &s;ucceeded to|lerably well, for from the commencement to the final di&s;&s;olution of the empire, the temple of Janus, always open in time of war, if we may credit the tradition of their be&s;t hi&s;torians, was hardly ever clo&s;ed. But &s;o &s;oon as the whole globe had acknowledged her authority, and bowed beneath the yoke, the immen&s;e fabric &s;he had thus rai&s;ed fell to pieces. External op|po&s;ition that had rai&s;ed it to the height it had attained, having cea&s;ed, its foundation was taken away. There was no principle within it to unite its parts together. From this it is to be pre&s;umed that if her government had been organized upon harmonious principles, and made the people happy under it, her dominion would never have extended over more than one-ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the territory it did. But be this as it may, the government of Rome acknowledged di&s;tinct orders of people, in which indeed the ari&s;tocracy prevailed, and can of cour&s;e furni&s;h n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ex|ample for us. This may be &s;aid of Lacedemon and of Carthage, for according to the opinion of a profound hi&s;torian and ob&s;erver on the &s;ubject of government, that of Carthage was al&s;o divided and the greater portion of power taken from the people and placed in the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of the ari&s;tocracy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Polybius,</HI> vol. 3, page 92.</NOTE> If any ever were, Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, were for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|cracies.

Even the king of France, &s;en&s;ible that his government will be happier for his &s;ubjects, and more faithful and beneficial for him&s;elf, has &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the provincial a&s;&s;emblies for this purpo&s;e, yet it cannot be denied that his powers are otherwi&s;e &s;ufficiently great, or that any monarch was ever, in a greater degree, or more de&s;ervedly beloved by his people. But if the&s;e examples are not &s;ufficient to warn us of the fatal con&s;equences that will attend the ve&s;ting &s;uch powers in the Congre&s;s, let us turn our attention to tho&s;e nearer at home, and which perhaps will make a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on our minds, and do we not behold the province of Maine &s;eparating from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Vermont from New York, Wyomin from Penn&s;ylvania, and the di&s;trict of Kentucky from Virginia, on this very principle, with others no le&s;s &s;triking that might be enumerated.</P>
<P>It is true the improvement of government under this form, by repre&s;entation, the di&s;covery of which is attributed to modern times, might make &s;ome difference in this re&s;pect, but are there no bounds within which it &s;hould &s;till be re&s;trained? Shall it attempt things that &s;eem from the concurrent te&s;timony of all hi&s;tory to be the appropriate object of de&s;poti&s;m?

The powers of the executive had of cour&s;e been proportionably increa&s;ed, for it is natural for the latter to &s;upply the defects of the former.

If by this it is intended to comprehend the right of direct taxation and exci&s;e with the ab&s;olute controul of the re&s;ources of the union, it will be ea&s;y to perceive it con&s;equences.

<P>To organize a general government, that &s;hall contain within it a particular one for each &s;tate, or in other words, to form a con&s;titution for each &s;tate, which &s;hall acknowledge that of the union, is no ea&s;y thing, for there never was an example of the kind before.

No po&s;&s;ible ground of variance or even interference &s;hould be left, for there would the conflict commence, that might perhaps prove fatal to both. As the very being or exi&s;tence of the republican form in America, and of cour&s;e the happine&s;s and intere&s;ts of the people depend on this point, the utmo&s;t clearne&s;s and per&s;picuity &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be u&s;ed to trace the boundary between them.

&s;hould be given to the confederacy, and tho&s;e of the latter retained to the &s;tates. If the federal government has a right to exerci&s;e direct legi&s;lation within the &s;tates, their re&s;pec|tive &s;overeignties are at an end, and a complete con&s;olidation or incorporation of the whole into one, e&s;tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed in their &s;tead. For in government it is, as in phi&s;icks, a maxim, that two powers cannot occupy the &s;ame &s;pace at the &s;ame time. Let this therefore be the characteri&s;tic line of the divi&s;ion; internal legi&s;lation or the management of tho&s;e concerns which are entirely local &s;hall belong to the &s;tates, and that of tho&s;e which have a foreign a&s;pect, and in which they have a national concern, to the confederacy. In forming a con&s;titution on the&s;e principles, the &s;ame rule &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that has been in forming tho&s;e of indivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ual &s;tates; defining the powers given and qualifying the mode, in which they &s;hall be exerci&s;ed. All powers not ceded it is true belong to the people; but tho&s;e given in a con&s;titution are expre&s;&s;ed in general terms, as that the Congre&s;s &s;hall levy and collect duties; this involves in it the right of making laws for the purpo&s;e, for the means are included in the power; otherwi&s;e it is a nullity. The &s;pecies of evidence and the mode of tryal are &s;ubordinate objects under it, and does it not follow that the Congre&s;s might regulate the&s;e at plea&s;ure? How are we &s;ecured in the trial by jury? This mo&s;t excellent mode of tryal which has been found, in tho&s;e few countries where it has been adopted, the bulwark of their rights, and which is the terror of di&s;potic governments, for it di&s;arms them of half their power, is but a matter of police, of human invention; if then we gave general powers unle&s;s we qualified their exerci&s;e by &s;ecuring this, might they not regulate it otherwi&s;e? I would not be under&s;tood to in&s;inuate it would be the ca&s;e, but that it were po&s;&s;ible is improper. The &s;pirit of the times might &s;ecure the people of America perhaps for a great length of time again&s;t it; but fundamental principles form a check, even when the &s;pirit of the times hath changed, indeed they retard and controul it. As it is with the trial by jury &s;o with the liberty of con&s;cience; that of the pre&s;s and many others. As to the powers them&s;elves, the di&s;tinction being drawn, the enumeration would be of cour&s;e. To tho&s;e of the former Congre&s;s &s;ome few might be added, or from tho&s;e of the con&s;titution, &s;ome few taken away, for nominally there is not &s;o great a difference between them as &s;ome people &s;uppo&s;e. To the former for in&s;tance, let the ab&s;olute controul of commerce with the revenues ari&s;ing from it be added. Let the right of apportionment be as in the con&s;titution, for the ground on which the &s;tates have met on that point is certainly a happy compromi&s;e being that indeed which had been long re|commended by Congre&s;s. Let them regulate the di&s;ciplining and training of the militia&mdash;the calling them forth and commanding them in &s;ervice; for the militia of a country, is its only &s;afe and proper defence. All countries are more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to danger, either from in&s;ur|rection or inva&s;ion and the greater the authority of Congre&s;s over this re&s;pectable body of men, in who&s;e hands every thing would be &s;afe, the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity there would be, to have recour&s;e to that bane of all &s;ocieties, the de&s;troy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of the rights of men, a &s;tanding army. But it may be urged the revenues from the impo&s;t would not be &s;ufficient for national purpo&s;es, and that with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the right of direct taxation, the government would be forced to have recour&s;e, to the expedient of requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tions, the inemcacy of which had a ready been &s;ufficiently experienced.

<P>Having defined the powers, marked the line between, and &s;ecured as far as po&s;&s;ible the harmony of the two governments, by making the former a part of the latter, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to organize it upon &s;uch principles, as to &s;ecure the wi&s;dom and happine&s;s of its admini|&s;tration; for I pre&s;ume it does not nece&s;&s;arily follow, becau&s;e the con&s;titutional acts of the go|vernment will be executed and become the laws of the land in each &s;tate that our re|&s;earches &s;hould be at an end, and that we &s;hould conclude we had remedied all the defects of the pre&s;ent one. On the contrary our anxiety &s;hould be increa&s;ed tenfold. From that our &s;afety was to be attributed to its imbicility; but from this we &s;hould not be able to &s;helter our&s;elves under that protection. We &s;hould therefore be the more zealous, proportioned to the prize we have at &s;take, to di&s;tribute the powers and poize the government, &s;o as to &s;ecure equal ju&s;tice in all its acts, to every part of the confederacy; for wretched and forlorn will the condition of that be, which &s;hall not find it&s;elf equally &s;ecure under the protection, and in the enjoyment of its ble&s;&s;ings, with every other part. From royalty it&s;elf, where the power is concentered in but one per&s;on, fluctuating in its &s;y&s;tems and un&s;ettled in its cour&s;e, &s;ometimes a ray of benevolence and even of ju&s;tice is reflected on tho&s;e whom it had marked out as the object of its re&s;entment. Nature has ca&s;t into but few characters &s;uch malign and unfriendly di&s;po&s;itions, that their revenge cannot be fatiated.

But the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem is that we have to remedy and we &s;hould never loo&s;e &s;ight of its defects.

Its movements would be as flow and its deci&s;ions as unju&s;t as they &s;ometimes have been. In &s;hort it would &s;till be a government of &s;tates in every re&s;pect and not a national one.

<P><PB N="14" REF="021263_0012_0FB2B7C031CD5420">If the &s;tates as &s;uch or in their legi&s;lative character appoint any of the officers of this go|vernment, the effect will be the &s;ame, provided the rotative principle is pre&s;erved, which will I hope never be given up, that has already been experienced; for in the appointment is in|volved that of re&s;pon&s;ibility. It &s;hould therefore proceed from the people immediately, or by means of electors cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. This will make them amenable to the people only for their conduct, or to &s;uch con&s;titutional tribunals where they are practicable, as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h to take cognizance of offences. This we apprehend would contribute much to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national government; each would move in the &s;phere the con&s;titu|tion had appointed for it, and be accountable to the people only for their conduct, the high and pure &s;ource, from whence they re&s;pectively derived their authorities.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative branches are in all democratic governments, and of cour&s;e would be &s;o in this, the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people. They &s;hould therefore be kept as dependent on them as po&s;&s;ible, having in all re&s;pects the &s;ame intere&s;ts with them&s;elves. For offences in the&s;e branches the general government can provide no puni&s;hment, for there can be no tribu|nal under it, to take cognizance of them. Charges of corruption or pro&s;ecutions for it, or other offences, committed by tho&s;e in the&s;e branches, &s;hould not be allowed from tho&s;e in the others, for this might either unite them in mal-practices again&s;t their country, or create end|le&s;s &s;trife between them, and thereby de&s;troy the balance of the government. A free people are the only proper judges of the merits of tho&s;e who &s;erve them, and they only &s;hould bring them to ju&s;tice. This &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of frequent elections. The members of each &s;hould in my opinion return to the body of the people, tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives at the expiration of every two years, and tho&s;e of the &s;enate of every four years, capable how|ever always of re-election. Both the&s;e branches &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible be filled on the principles of repre&s;entation from all the &s;tates. For the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the rule adopted in the con&s;titution, is perhaps the proper one. Let twice that number, or a &s;till greater ratio of numbers to that of repre&s;entation, be the rule for the &s;enate. The members or both branches &s;hould be incapable of appointment to other offices whil&s;t in the&s;e, otherwi&s;e a wide door will be left open for corruption. This is not an idle or vi&s;ionary precaution, but in a great mea|&s;ure the pivot, upon which the upright and faithful admini&s;tration of the government will depend. The experience of Britain hath demon&s;trated, how often the mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts of the people, have been bartered away, by leading members of the hou&s;e of commons for a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers, or &s;ome lucrative office in the government; how much greater then &s;hould our apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion be, of danger in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, when we recol|lect that the government is organized upon &s;uch principles as to acknowledge no re&s;pon&s;ibility to the &s;tates, and comprehends within it &s;uch an extent of territory, as to put it out of the power of tho&s;e who inhabit its extremities, to have any knowledge of the conduct of their &s;ervants! The po&s;&s;ibility of this kind of traffic &s;hould therefore be ab&s;olutely prohibited.</P>
<P>But the power of the legi&s;lature &s;hould be confined to tho&s;e objects, which were intirely legi&s;lative in their nature, as the regulation of trade, requi&s;itions for money, and the like. The &s;ounde&s;t authorities and the melancholy experience of our &s;tate governments have &s;hewn the propriety of this re&s;traint, in a con&s;titution over one &s;tate, and for rea&s;ons that are obvi|ous the expedience, will be the more urgent, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Its natural effort in all ca&s;es is, to gra&s;p to it&s;elf all the powers delegated from the people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Lolme.</NOTE> and to pro&s;trate the other branches before it; &s;timulated on by the &s;tate &s;pirit, which will in &s;ome degree &s;till remain,
<PB N="15" REF="021263_0013_0FB2B7C32CE69930">
the difficulty here will be proportionably increa&s;ed. The ingenuity of man can devi&s;e no other, without an appeal to the people, which if po&s;&s;ible &s;hould always be avoided, than that of giving the Executive, the other active branch an ab&s;olute negative on the laws; for otherwi&s;e its enterprizes mu&s;t be &s;ucce&s;sful. Many re&s;traints might be di&s;ignated by the con&s;titution, but without effect. And from this at the &s;ame time that it pre&s;erved the balance of the go|vernment, no injury could be &s;u&s;tained Again&s;t the encroachments of the Executive the fears and apprehen&s;ions of the whole continent would be awake, with a watchful jealou&s;y they would ob&s;erve its movements. But again&s;t the legi&s;lature (if we may rea&s;on by analogy of that branch in this) from tho&s;e in other governments, no &s;uch apprehen&s;ions could be enter|tained. Its movements comparitively would be accompanied with the confidence of the peo|ple. Every incroachment upon its rights would be popular. In every conte&s;t between them it mu&s;t of cour&s;e yield the ground. In &s;hort unle&s;s the Executive had a negative on the laws of the legi&s;lature, it would &s;oon exi&s;t only in name.</P>
<P>The right of impeachment and the mode of trial are of the fir&s;t importance in this govern|ment. The former, if with the people or even the &s;tates them&s;elves, would never be exerted or greatly abu&s;ed; it &s;hould therefore belong to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. And the latter &s;hould be ve&s;ted in a court of that high confidence and re&s;pectability of character, as to par|take of none of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that &s;way the bulk of mankind. Unconnected by office, and of cour&s;e no way intere&s;ted in the event; unacquainted with the crime except as it might appear before them by &s;atisfactory te&s;timony, they &s;hould hear calmly and judge di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately upon the merits of the cau&s;e. From their deci&s;ion the guilty would receive a fair condemnation, or the innocent be re&s;tored again to the confidence of their country, and the people return &s;a|tisfied that their pa&s;&s;ions had been awakened, and their fears alarmed without any ju&s;t foun|dation. The &s;entence &s;hould be final, and not &s;hifted off to another tribunal. A further pro|&s;ecution may appear odious, and the ju&s;t re&s;entments of the people calm away, and totally &s;ub|&s;ide. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the &s;enate &s;hould form the court of impeachment.</P>
<P>But although the legi&s;lative branch &s;hall be elected by the people, and amenable to them alone for their conduct, yet as the &s;tate &s;overeignties though qualified, will &s;till remain, and of cour&s;e the &s;tate &s;pirit, in contradiction to a foederal one, from nece&s;&s;ity be more or le&s;s in|fluential in its councils, we &s;hould turn our attention to the other branches of the govern|ment, as our firm re&s;ource. The Executive is that upon which, in many re&s;pects, we &s;hould re&s;t our hopes, for an equal, a foederal, and a wi&s;e admini&s;tration. Every po&s;&s;ible effort &s;hould therefore be u&s;ed to expell from the hearts of tho&s;e who fill it, a preference of one part of the community to another. The experience of other governments hath taught us, it is po&s;&s;ible to devi&s;e checks, which from motives of policy and private intere&s;t, will even make bad men faithful public &s;ervants. The pro&s;pect of reward and the fear of puni&s;hment, as has already been ob&s;erved, are the mo&s;t powerful incentives to virtuous action. It &s;hould therefore be &s;o orga|nized, as to give every quarter indeed every man of the union, under the influence of the&s;e prin|ciples, as to tho&s;e who fill it, an equal acce&s;s to the human heart, whenever this equipoi&s;e is de|&s;troyed, and this high character taught to look up to this, or that &s;tate, or combination of &s;tates for the &s;miles or the frowns of government, from that moment will its oppre&s;&s;ion be felt, and a dreadful anarchy in&s;ue. And if you take from tho&s;e whom the choice of their country hath called forth to this high &s;tation, the hope of further favour, and mark to them the extent of &s;ervice, after the completion of which the door &s;hall be forever clo&s;ed upon them, in that
<PB N="16" REF="021263_0014_0FB2B7C63703E0A8">
degree will you deprive your&s;elf of one of the principal in&s;truments by which you are to pre|&s;erve the equilibrium, and &s;ecure the public &s;afety. Di&s;charged forever from the &s;ervice of the United States, will not the approbation of the union, cea&s;e to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and an accommodation to &s;tate intere&s;ts take its place and influence many of the public mea&s;ures? For the&s;e rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h to &s;ee the right of impeachment, ex|tended upon as liberal ground as po&s;&s;ible, given for in&s;tance to the repre&s;entatives of one third of the confederacy; and I could likewi&s;e wi&s;h to &s;ee the citizen at the head of this department, capable of re-election at the expiration of his &s;ervice which &s;hould be at the end of every three or four years, &s;o long as he &s;hould merit the confidence of his country.</P>
<P>The mode of election &s;hould al&s;o be a fundamental in the organization of this branch. If the command of this office was placed within the reach of court influence, the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences were to be apprehended from it. If the ultimate deci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on &s;hould happen at the metropolis, it is ea&s;y to be perceived what an opportunity this would pre&s;ent for venality and corruption. It mu&s;t be a great object particularly for either France or Britain to have the friend of their re&s;pective courts in this office, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch exten&s;ive powers and which might di&s;pen&s;e &s;uch important favours to them. The influence of the pre&s;iding magi&s;trate him&s;elf, e&s;pecially within the town in which he had for &s;ome time re&s;ided, and to who&s;e citizens he had rendered many &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervices, and who of cour&s;e would be aver&s;e to the introduction of a <HI>novus homo</HI> among them, would not be incon&s;iderable. In addition to which it is to be ob&s;erved, that it forms a departure from a principle which &s;hould prevail through the whole, but particularly in the organization of this branch, a dependance of this officer, for every thing e&s;timable among mankind, upon the people of America. By the people there|fore &s;hould the appointment be made, not in per&s;on, but by the means of electors cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. To prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any interference, or byas on their free election, that of the electors by the people, &s;hould be on the &s;ame day in every &s;tate, and that of the Pre&s;ident by the electors likewi&s;e on the &s;ame day and at &s;ome &s;pecified place in each, unle&s;s an inva&s;ion, or other extraordinary circum&s;tance &s;hould prevent it; in which ca&s;e perhaps the electors them&s;elves, or the executive of the &s;tate might appoint &s;ome other. Whatever time might be employed in this mode of election is immaterial; it is of the fir&s;t importance, and &s;hould never be di&s;pen&s;ed with, that he be thus appointed.</P>
<P>But high power in the Executive branch require in every re&s;pect, a direct and immediate re&s;pon&s;ibility; for although it &s;hould be &s;o organized as that whil&s;t to tho&s;e who fill it, and act with propriety in the di&s;charge of its functions, the door &s;hould be left open for a continuance of public favour, yet the &s;word of ju&s;tice &s;hould be held con&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended over the heads of tho&s;e, who &s;hall be convicted of having ba&s;ely &s;acrificed the intere&s;ts, or made attempts upon the liberties of their country. There &s;hould be no con&s;titutional re&s;traint, no equivocation of office, to &s;hield a traitor from the ju&s;tice of an injured people. No circum&s;tance to blunt or turn a&s;ide the keen edge of their re&s;entment. With the charge &s;hould the powers of his of|fice cea&s;e. He &s;hould &s;tand alone un&s;upported, and unprotected except by the integrity of his heart and the rectitude of his conduct. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the executive power &s;hould be ve&s;t|ed altogether in one per&s;on; unre&s;trained by a con&s;titutional council, its operations will be more ea&s;y and regular, and its re&s;pon&s;ibility the greater and more immediate. And for the&s;e rea&s;ons if there is a con&s;titutional council it mu&s;t be from its nature the mo&s;t improper tribu|nal, that can be formed or conceived, for the tryal of the offences of the principal, &s;ince they mu&s;t be either partakers of the crime, or &s;ome way or either a party intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="021263_0015_0FB2B7C89EEA5650">With an Executive organized on the&s;e principles, being independent of the legi&s;lature, and in a very re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituation, I &s;hould be well content to intru&s;t great powers, becau&s;e I &s;hould calculate with tolerable certainty upon an hone&s;t and a wi&s;e execution of them. The con&s;titution perhaps &s;ugge&s;ts tho&s;e, with &s;ome exceptions that are proper; whether it would be &s;afe to give it the ab&s;olute controul of the fleet and army at all times, in peace and war, the ordering them out, and laying them by, without con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature, or even knowledge, is at lea&s;t doubtful. In Great Britain this power may be committed to the King with pro|priety; but he is the Lord of hereditary dominions, and tran&s;mits the inheritance in his lime forever. By betraying his tru&s;t he might lo&s;e his crown, and perhaps gain nothing, even if he e&s;tabli&s;hed de&s;poti&s;m. But with the Pre&s;ident who perhaps depends on a quadriennial election the ca&s;e is different. It is certainly a formidable power to place in the hands of any one pub|lic &s;ervant. I would however in no event interpo&s;e the opinion of the legi&s;lature, &s;o as to con|troul the movements of the&s;e forces, but merely to affix the condition, or emergency, upon which his ab&s;olute power over them &s;hould commence. As I would repo&s;e the whole tru&s;t of this department in one officer, &s;o he alone &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible for all its tran&s;actions. He might a&s;&s;ociate whom he plea&s;ed, of the wi&s;e men of America in his councils, but they &s;hould be of his own a&s;&s;ociation. An allowance might be made him, to compen&s;ate them for their &s;ervices, for which he &s;hould be accountable.</P>
<P>Controver&s;ies between independent nations are u&s;ually &s;ettled by the &s;word. It is to the misfortune of mankind that no tribunal has ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed to adju&s;t their interfering claims, and inforce its decrees. It has been the defect of all other confederacies, of who&s;e in&s;titutions hi&s;tory has given us any account, that although attempts in &s;ome have been made in this re&s;pect to pre&s;erve the harmony, and le&s;&s;en the calamities of mankind, yet the courts to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m their controver&s;ies have been &s;ubmitted, the council or repre&s;entative body of each, have not been organized on &s;uch principles as to in&s;ure ju&s;tice in all their deci&s;ions. To this circum&s;tance perhaps many of their calamities were to be attributed. The framers of the confederation in &s;ome degree al&s;o fell into this error for tho&s;e only or a territorial kind were to be &s;ubmitted to a foederal court. Under that form its inconveni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce has been often very &s;en&s;ibly felt, but under the pre&s;ent it would be in&s;upportable.

I mu&s;t however confe&s;s my mind has not as yet acknowledged in there re&s;pects, the &s;ame pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the &s;enate. The great defect as has been already often ob&s;erved in the pre&s;ent form, is that of its being a diplomatic corps, a government by and for &s;tates, and not in any view of it a national one. In changing it, the object &s;hould be to correct that defect in all ca&s;es whatever, &s;o far as it might be practicable, which can only be done by taking the appointment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the hands of the &s;tates, in their legi&s;lative characters, and pla|cing it in tho&s;e of the people, or electors by them appointed for the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;e. This has been done with the members of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, but departed from with tho&s;e of the Senate. This branch will therefore be in every re&s;pect the repre&s;entative of the &s;tates, dependent on and re&s;pon&s;ible to them for their conduct. In forming a right e&s;timate of the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from this property in the choracter of this body, and of the tone it may give to the mea&s;ures of the government, we mu&s;t examine its powers in every direction, and pur&s;ue its operation upon every &s;ubject. And fir&s;t as to its &s;hare in the legi&s;lature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> its influence upon all legi&s;lative acts.</P>
<P>The &s;enate has an ab&s;olute negative upon all laws; from this it re&s;ults that tho&s;e not for the advantage of the &s;tates, or the prevailing fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion in the government, to which they re&s;pectively belong will by tho&s;e thus circum&s;tanced be rejected; for is it to be pre&s;umed that becau&s;e ten members from Virginia, eight from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts or Penn&s;ylvania in the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives, have pa&s;&s;ed a bill, whil&s;t one from Rhode I&s;land or Delaware only had rejected it, that the&s;e &s;tates will give up their equal &s;uffrage in the &s;enate? Is it not more pre&s;umable that their &s;enators will look on at the nominal and unimportant &s;uperiority of tho&s;e &s;tates, in the other hou&s;e, laugh at their &s;uppo&s;ed triumph, and await coolly its &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their board, where its &s;ate will be inevitable? Or is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the right to orig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nate money bills, a thing proper in it&s;elf, being the more democratic branch, in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, will controul this di&s;po&s;ition, e&s;pecially when we recollect that they are both only repre&s;enta|tive branches, equally dependent on the pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch a bill for their wages or &s;alary, and that the members of the latter holding their offices for a &s;horter term, have perhaps not been able to introduce &s;uch a degree of oeconomy and order into their finances. This is a check of great importance in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and indeed the pre&s;ervation of the democracy, but the con&s;truction and principles of the two governments are &s;o radically different, that it will be ea&s;ily perceived by the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;erver, the &s;ame effects are not to be expected from it, at lea&s;t not to the &s;ame extent in this, that are experienced in that. Making due allowance for tho&s;e con&s;iderations that &s;hould be taken into view, I am therefore led to believe that the defective principles of the pre&s;ent government, through the means of the &s;enate, in re&s;pect to form and repre&s;entation, have been communicated to this branch of the con&s;titution. Ap|pointed by the &s;tates and of cour&s;e re&s;pon&s;ible to them for their conduct, the &s;enators will act for tho&s;e to which they re&s;pectively belong; nor can we rea&s;onably expect from their conce&s;&s;ion any great accommodation. Thus the &s;tate &s;pirit, with an equality among the members of the union, will be pre&s;erved in this branch of the government, and if there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for yielding the point of repre&s;entation, yet none &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf, at lea&s;t to me, for not remedying the defect in the form, which has been found &s;o pernicious in the pre&s;ent one.</P>

The &s;ubjecting

the deci&s;ion of important que&s;tions to a dependence on the occa&s;ional pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of any of the members, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, appears to me improper. If the vote of two thirds of the body is in any in&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ecurity of the intere&s;ts of any part of the union, why &s;hould the death or delinquency of a member deprive it of this &s;afeguard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. It is further to be ob&s;erved that whatever influence this branch may have in directing the mea&s;ures of the executive, from the nature of its appointment, will be exerted to give it a narrow &s;tate byas, and that from this &s;ource alone, con&s;tructed as the two branches are, much injury is to be ex|pected from this extraordinary coalition.</P>
<P>"The &s;enate &s;hall have the &s;ole power to try all impeachments." The pre&s;ident is to act under their controul in the ca&s;es above &s;tated, if in any in&s;tance a wanton violation by their direction or permi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made, which though not probable is yet practicable, of the rights or intere&s;ts of any part of the community, and after &s;olemn debate in the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives, this high officer &s;hould be brought by impeachment before this body to expiate his offence, what would be his fate, e&s;pecially as he &s;till held his office and might wield his pow|ers in his defence? A king of England involved him&s;elf in great difficulties by an attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h the validity of a general pardon, but had the con&s;titution &s;ubmitted the trial of &s;tate offenders to him&s;elf, there would have been no occa&s;ion fort he conte&s;t. Admitting how|ever the members of this body to be incapable of moral turpitude, may we not &s;uppo&s;e, as might be the ca&s;e in that of any individual &s;tate; in the operation of this government, that offences might be committed again&s;t one quarter of the community, and which before a di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate court would receive &s;evere reprehen&s;ion, that would be highly beneficial to the others? And in &s;uch a ca&s;e could we expect from the repre&s;entatives of the&s;e &s;tates a candid or impar|tial deci&s;ion again&s;t the intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents?</P>
<P>The placing the executive power in the hands of one per&s;on, appears to be perfectly right. If this branch had been put into commi&s;&s;ion, the &s;tate &s;pirit would have been communicated to it, and have tainted all its mea&s;ures; in addition to this there would have been le&s;s re&s;pon|&s;ibility. But the mode of election, does not in all re&s;pects appear, to merit &s;uch commendation A departure from the &s;trict repre&s;entative line, by adding the equal vote of the &s;enate to the number each &s;tate hath in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, is made in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; but it is &s;till more exceptionable in other re&s;pects. If an election &s;hall not be made, and in all proba|bility this will often be the ca&s;e, indeed the pre&s;umption is the contrary will &s;eldom happen, a very extraordinary &s;ub&s;idiary mode is re&s;orted to. Tho&s;e having the five highe&s;t votes are to be ballotted for by the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the vote to be taken by &s;tates, and one member from each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the vote of the &s;tate. All ca&s;es that the con&s;titution will admit of, &s;hould be con&s;idered as likely to happen &s;ome time or other. No per&s;on then I am per&s;uaded who will make the calculation, can behold the facility by which the chair of the United States may be approached and atchieved, even contrary to the wi&s;hes of the people, without equal anxiety and &s;urprize<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is obvious that &s;even men only may elect the Pre&s;ident; the con&s;titution has not been copied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r any part of it, becau&s;e it is pre&s;umed to be in the memory of every per&s;on.</NOTE>. Let it be admitted that the temper of the times and the ardent &s;pirit of liberty which now prevails, will guard it for the pre&s;ent from &s;uch ea&s;y acce&s;s; but that per&s;on has profited but little, from the faithful admonition which all hi&s;tory has given him, who &s;hall conclude from thence, that this will always be the ca&s;e. His right to remain in office after im|peachment, with the influence though dimini&s;hed, &s;till attending it, appears to be highly improper.

That of adjournment in ca&s;e of impeachment, between the two branches, to &s;uch time as he &s;hall think fit, is certainly too unqualified and exten&s;ive. The impropriety of the union of this branch with the &s;enate has already been &s;ufficiently dilated on; it will therefore be unnece&s;&s;ary to re|peat the &s;ame arguments here. Contemplating however the con&s;equences of this union, the expiration of his &s;ervice, &s;hould in my opinion be accompanied with a temporary di&s;qualifica|tion. The &s;enators, would to &s;ave the commonwealth from injury, be able to give in&s;truction to a new pri&s;ident, and it would perhaps be better, to change occa&s;ionally the acting party, of a combination that might otherwi&s;e be dangerous.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t clau&s;e re&s;pecting the judiciary it is obvious, that the Congre&s;s, although there &s;hall be one Supreme Court only, may e&s;tabli&s;h as many &s;ubordinate to it, as they &s;hall think fit. The pre&s;umption is, they will e&s;tabli&s;h &s;o many as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;|charge of the functions of the department, to the advantage of the government, and benefit of the people. The extent therefore of the duties which become the exclu&s;ive object of a foe|deral court, may give &s;ome in&s;ight into that e&s;tabli&s;hment they might probably adopt; and when we ob&s;erve that the cognizance of all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution and the laws, either of a civil or criminal nature, in law or equity, with tho&s;e other objects which it &s;peci|fies, even between the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, are taken from tho&s;e of each &s;tate and ab&s;o|lutely appropriated to the courts of the United States, we are led into a view of the very important intere&s;ts it comprehends, and of the exten&s;ive &s;cale upon which it operates. It will therefore be the duty of Congre&s;s to organize this branch, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch &s;ubordinate courts, throughout the whole confederacy, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be found nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport the authority of the government, and carry ju&s;tice home, &s;o far as it may be practicable, to the doors of all its inhabitants. What mode may be be&s;t calculated to accom|pli&s;h this end, belongs to that body to determine. Bound by no rule they may it is true (as in the commencement they probably would) avail them&s;elves of tho&s;e of each &s;tate; but this would be a mea&s;ure of expedience only and not of right, and may hereafter be changed as the fortunes of the government, and con&s;iderations of expedience may dictate. How far it might be proper to authori&s;e the &s;ubjects of foreign powers to carry the citizens of any &s;tate into a foederal court, and afterwards by appeal into the Supreme Court, is of que&s;tionable propriety. The principal argument in its favour appears to be that of &s;ecuring the United States from the danger of controver&s;ies with &s;uch powers, under the partial deci&s;ions of tho&s;e of the individual &s;tates. But if they knew &s;uch ca&s;es, were by a fundamental of our government &s;ubmitted to them, it were rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that all ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint, would be removed. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a foederal court of conte&s;ts upon ordinary &s;ubjects, between citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, or even of different &s;tates, or indeed upon any &s;ubject, that did not ari&s;e under territo|rial controver&s;ies between &s;tates, and which originally belonged to that court, appears to be highly improper and altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. The appeal as to fact is &s;till more extraordinary and exceptionable. The verdict which has been found mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;et a&s;ide, and the court &s;ubjected to the nece&s;&s;ity of either trying the cau&s;e upon the evidence already given, with liberty to con&s;true it at plea&s;ure; of hearing it over again admitting other evidence, being judges of the fact them&s;elves; or &s;ubmitting it to another jury to find a &s;econd verdict, either of which modes appears to be highly exceptionable; for if the court become judges of fact under the old or a new trial, the right of trial by jury is di&s;pen&s;ed with; and if a &s;econd jury &s;hall be &s;ummoned, independent of the difficulty and hard&s;hip, attending the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of con|trover&s;ies contracted at the extremities of the union, by people in &s;ome degree variant in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir

What nece&s;&s;ity there can be, &s;o effectually to lay a&s;ide the &s;tate courts, (which though perhaps improperly organized at pre&s;ent are yet capable of improvement) and &s;ubject the good people of America to &s;uch new and unheard of difficulties, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not able to compre|hend, nor can I readily for&s;ee the very important con&s;equences into which it may lead.</P>
<P>Having now taken a view as conci&s;ely as I have been able, of the defects of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, &s;ugge&s;ted their remedy with the principles upon which it is founded, examined the con&s;titution by that &s;tandard, and &s;hewn wherein I have either approved or di&s;approved of it; perhaps it may be expected (as a deduction from the foregoing principles) that I &s;hould make &s;ome calculation, of the probable cour&s;e and ultimate fate of the government, &s;hould it be adopted in its pre&s;ent form, &s;ince it might have &s;ome influence upon your opinion in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. This mu&s;t however be altogether conjectural, for in the operation of govern|ment, as in that of all other powers after con&s;equences, have been clearly demon&s;trated, as re&s;ult|ing from certain cau&s;es, oftentimes &s;ome incident, not contemplated, nor taken into the combina|tion, or extra circum&s;tance ari&s;es, that gives it a different di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction. To form any e&s;timate in this re&s;pect &s;ome peculiarities pre&s;ent them&s;elves to view very de&s;erving of attention. The mix|ture between the general and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate governments, being partly a con&s;olidated and partly a confede|rated one, &s;ugge&s;ts a balance between &s;overeignties that is new and intere&s;ting. So far as it pro|ceeds from the people and its powers embrace the care of their intere&s;ts, it partakes of the qualities of the former; and &s;o far as the &s;tate governments remain of the latter. In weighing the mo|mentum of their relative &s;trength or force it is no le&s;s difficult to determine which will prepon|derate. Founded alike by the people, by the people al&s;o may either be changed at plea&s;ure. If the preci&s;e boundary had been drawn between them, the proper checks e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the general government well poi&s;ed, might for a long time, and I &s;hould hope forever, be &s;tationary; defective in the&s;e re&s;pects it will probably &s;oon experience a change. Pur&s;uing a natural cour&s;e under tho&s;e &s;hocks it mu&s;t expect, without any foreign impre&s;&s;ion to give it the faire&s;t hopes, let us enquire what the intere&s;ts of the people will dictate, for let that be its direction. Independent &s;tate &s;overeignties, or partial confederacies, have been reprobated in its commencement. Its foundation has been laid on the ruin of all &s;chemes that had that tendency, and it is pre&s;umeable it would in no event embrace either, at lea&s;t until it had ex|perienced a great vici&s;&s;itude of fortunes. If then it e&s;caped the fir&s;t paroxi&s;ms, the &s;evere &s;truggles, and violent efforts again&s;t it, expo&s;ed it to, its e&s;tabli&s;hment might be con&s;idered as complete. And &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, its con&s;titutional ba&s;is will be found broad and exten&s;ive. It is not the aid of the Delphic oracle, the blind zeal of enthu&s;ia&s;im, that will be called in to its &s;upport. It has the protection of the true religion, of divine au|thority it&s;elf, to &s;hield it from danger. The exerci&s;e of powers in common that will be al|lowed of in its commencement, mu&s;t yield on the part of the &s;tates, to its acquiring &s;trength. And wielding tho&s;e the con&s;titution has given it without availing it&s;elf of &s;uch as were con|&s;tructive, the &s;tate governments, under this progre&s;s, would &s;oon become a burthen to the people. The confederated principle, or the &s;pirit of &s;tate &s;overeignty, would however not be inactive, but operate &s;o as to bring on the cri&s;is; and the con&s;titution it&s;elf pre&s;ents a fruitful &s;ource of controver&s;y, for the &s;pirit of accommodation, or the mutual fear of danger, mu&s;t be

great, where the line between them is not exactly drawn, if they do not interfere. If this government had been organized over one &s;tate, with a moderate extent of territory, its natu|ral progre&s;s, through the Senate, would be to ari&s;tocracy. But as it is I am inclined to believe, that although in its operation it may bear that tone, yet when it becomes convul&s;ed and expe|riences a change, it will hold a different direction. Even the con&s;truction of that branch in its operation will contribute to hurry it into monarchy, and our earne&s;t hopes and prayers &s;hould be, every circum&s;tance con&s;idered, that it be a limitted one. For the&s;e rea&s;ons and not that I fear any danger to the liberties of our country, from the effective force of the government, exerted immediately again&s;t the good people of America, could I wi&s;h tho&s;e checks and guards adopted, omitted at pre&s;ent from neglect and an over confidence of our &s;ecurity, but which it is po&s;&s;ible if the pre&s;ent opportunity is lo&s;t, we may contend for hereafter in vain.

<P>I have to apologize for the trouble I have given you in the peru&s;al of the ob&s;ervations.

But if I have been able to explain my&s;elf to your &s;atisfaction I &s;hall be contented. Upon the whole it re&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts that although I am for a change, and a radical one, of the confederation, yet I have &s;ome &s;trong a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d invincible objections to that propo&s;ed to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead. Tho&s;e of le&s;s weight might be yielded for the &s;ake of accomodation; but until an experiment and prove the contrary, I &s;hall always believe that the exerci&s;e of direct taxation and exci&s;e, by one body, over the very exten&s;ive territory contained within the bounds of the United States, will terminate either in anarchy and a di&s;&s;olution of the government, or a &s;ubver&s;ion of liberty.
