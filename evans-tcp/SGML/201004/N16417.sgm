<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Argument. Reflection on leaving the land. The gale continues. A water-&s;pout. Beauty of a dying dolphin. The &s;hip's progre&s;s along the &s;hore. Wind &s;trengthens. The &s;ails reduced. A &s;hoal of porpoi&s;es. La&s;t appearance of cape Spado. Sea ri&s;es. A &s;quall. The &s;ails further dimini&s;h|ed. Main&s;ail &s;plit. Ship bears away before the wind. Again hauls upon the wind. Another main&s;ail fitted to the yard. The gale &s;till increa&s;es. Top&s;ails furled. Top|gallant-yards &s;ent down. Sea enlarges. Sun-&s;et. Cour&s;es reefed. Four &s;eamen lo&s;t off the lee main-yard-arm. Anxiety of the pilots from their dangerous &s;ituation. Re|&s;olute behaviour of the &s;ailors. The &s;hip labours in great di&s;tre&s;s. The artillery thrown overboard. Di&s;mal ap|pearance of the weather. Very high and dangerous &s;ea. Severe fatigue of the crew. Con&s;ultation and re&s;olution of the officers. Speech and advice of Albert to the crew. Nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;ition to veer before the wind. Di&s;ap|pointment in the propo&s;ed effect. New di&s;po&s;itions equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. The mizen-ma&s;t cut away.</P>

<L>The balanc'd &s;hip, now forward, now behind,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Ver. <HI>908.</HI> That the reader, who is unacquainted with the manoeuvres of navigation, may conceive a clearer idea of the &s;hip's &s;tate when <HI>trying;</HI> and of the change of her &s;ituation to that of <HI>&s;cudding,</HI> I have quoted a part of the explanation of tho&s;e articles as they appear in the Dictionary of the Marine.
<P>Trying is the &s;ituation in which a &s;hip lies nearly in the trough or hollow of the &s;ea in a tempe&s;t, particularly when it blows contrary to her cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In trying as well as in &s;cudding, the &s;ails are always re|duced in proportion to the increa&s;e of the &s;torm; and in either &s;tate, if the &s;torm is exce&s;&s;ive, &s;he may have all her &s;ails furl|ed; or be, according to the &s;ea-phra&s;e, <HI>under bare poles.</HI></P>
<P>The intent of &s;preading a &s;ail at this time is to keep the &s;hip more &s;teady, and to prevent her from rolling violently, by pre&s;|&s;ing her &s;ide down in the water; and al&s;o to turn her head towards the &s;ource of the wind, &s;o that the &s;hock of the &s;eas may fall more obliquely on her flank, than when &s;he lies along the trough of the &s;ea, or in the interval between two waves. While &s;he lies in this &s;ituation, the helm is fa&s;tened clo&s;e to the lee &s;ide, to prevent her as much as po&s;&s;ible from falling to lee|ward. But as the &s;hip is not then kept in equilibrium by the operation of her &s;ails, which at other times counterbalance each other at the head and &s;tern, &s;he is moved by a &s;low but continual vibration, which turns her head alternately to wind|ward and to leeward, forming an angle of <HI>30</HI> or <HI>40</HI> degrees in the interval. That part where &s;he &s;tops in approaching the direction of the wind, is called her <HI>coming-to;</HI> and the con|trary exce&s;s of the angle to leeward, is called her <HI>falling-off.</HI></P>
<P>Veering or wearing, ver. <HI>641. 808.</HI> as u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e, may be defined, the movement by which a &s;hip changes her &s;tate from trying to that of &s;cudding, or, of running be|fore the direction of the wind and &s;ea.</P>
<P>It is an axiom in natural philo&s;ophy, That every body will per&s;evere in a &s;tate of re&s;t, or of moving uniformly in a right line, unle&s;s it be compelled to change its &s;tate by forces impre&s;|&s;ed: and that the change of motion is proportional to the mov|ing force impre&s;&s;ed, and made according to the right line in which that force acts.</P>
<P>Hence it is ea&s;y to conceive how a &s;hip is compelled to turn into any direction by the force of the wind, acting upon any part of her length in lines parallel to the plane of the horizon. Thus in the act of veering, which is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this invariable principle, the object of the &s;eaman is to re|duce the action of the wind on the &s;hip's hind part, and to receive its utmo&s;t exertion on her fore part, &s;o that the latter may be pu&s;hed to leeward. This effect is either produced by the operation of the &s;ails, or by the impre&s;&s;ion of the wind on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ma&s;ts and yards. In the former ca&s;e the &s;ails on the hind part of the &s;hip are either furled or arranged nearly parallel to the direction of the wind, which then glides ineffectually along their &s;urfaces; at the &s;ame time the foremo&s;t &s;ails are &s;pread abroad, &s;o as to receive the greate&s;t exertion of the wind, ver. <HI>916.</HI> The fore part accordingly yields to this impul&s;e, and is put in motion, and this motion, nece&s;&s;arily con&s;piring with that of the wind, pu&s;hes the &s;hip about, as much as is requi&s;ite to produce the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>But when the tempe&s;t is &s;o violent as to preclude the u&s;e of &s;ails, the effort of the wind operates almo&s;t equally on the op|po&s;ite ends of the &s;hip, becau&s;e the ma&s;ts and yards &s;ituated near the head and &s;tern &s;erve to counterbalance each other, in receiving its impre&s;&s;ion. The effect of the helm is al&s;o con&s;i|derably dimini&s;hed, becau&s;e the headway, which gives life and vigour to all its operations, is at this time feeble and in|effectual. Hence it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy this equilibri|um, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the ma&s;ts and yards before and behind, and to throw the balance forward to prepare for v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing. If this cannot be effected by the arrangement of the yards on the ma&s;ts, and it becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to veer in order to &s;ave the &s;hip from de&s;truction, ver. <HI>927.</HI> the mi|zen-ma&s;t mu&s;t be cut away, and even the main-ma&s;t, if &s;he &s;till remains incapable of an&s;wering the helm by turning her prow to leeward.</P>
<P>Scudding is that movement in navigation by which a &s;hip is carried precipitately before a tempe&s;t, ver. <HI>645. 808.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As a &s;hip flies with amazing rapidity through the water, whenever this expedient is put in practice, it is never at|tempted in a contrary wind, unle&s;s when her condition ren|ders her incapable of &s;u&s;taining the mutual effort of the wind and waves any longer on her &s;ide, without being expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger.</P>
<P>A &s;hip either &s;cuds with a &s;ail extended on her fore-ma&s;t, or, if the &s;torm is exce&s;&s;ive, without any &s;ail, which in the &s;ea-phra&s;e is called &s;cudding <HI>under bare poles.</HI></P>
<P>The principal hazards incident to &s;cudding, are generally, a &s;ea &s;triking the &s;hip's &s;tern; the difficulty of &s;teering, which perpetually expo&s;es her to the danger of <HI>broaching-to;</HI> and the want of &s;ufficient &s;ea-room. A &s;ea which &s;trikes the &s;tern violently may &s;hatter it to pieces, by which the &s;hip mu&s;t in|evitably founder. By broaching-to &s;uddenly, &s;he is threaten|ed with lo&s;ing all her ma&s;ts and &s;ails, or being immediately overturned: and for want of &s;ea-room &s;he is expo&s;ed to the dangers of being w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecked on a lee-&s;hore.</P></NOTE></L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Argument. The de&s;ign and influence of poetry: applied to the &s;ubject. Wreck of the mizen-ma&s;t cleared away. Ship veers be|fore the wind; her violent agitation. Different &s;tations of the officers. Appearance of the i&s;land of Falconera. Excur&s;ion to the adjacent nations of Greece, renowned in antiquity. Athens. Socrates. Plato. Ari&s;tides. Solon. Corinth. Sparta. Leonidas. Inva&s;ion of Xerxes. Ly|curgus. Epaminondas. Modern appearance. Arcadia; its former happine&s;s and fertility; pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, the effect of &s;lavery. Ithaca. Uly&s;&s;es and Penelope. Argos and Mycenae. Agamemnon. Macroni&s;i. Lemnos. Vul|can and Venus. Delos. Apollo and Diana. Troy. Se&s;tos. Leander and Hero. Delphos. Temple of Apollo. Parna&s;&s;us. The Mu&s;es. The &s;ubject re&s;umed. Sparkling of the &s;ea. Prodigious tempe&s;t, accompanied with rain, hail, and meteors. Darkne&s;s, lightning, and thunder. Approach of day. Di&s;covery of land. The &s;hip in great danger pa&s;&s;es the i&s;land of St. George; turns her broad|&s;ide to the &s;hore; her bow&s;prit, fore-ma&s;t and maintop|ma&s;t carried away; &s;he &s;trikes a rock; &s;plits a&s;under. Fate of the crew.</P>
