<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the important occa&s;ion from which this anniver&s;ary derives its origin, and the re&s;pectable cha|racters that have exerted them&s;elves to perpetuate its hi&s;|tory, I confe&s;s there is an unu&s;ual &s;ecurity in my feelings; &s;ince no mi&s;taken effort of mine can injure an in&s;titution, founded on &s;o memorable an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;upported by names &s;o ju&s;tly claiming the applau&s;e of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WHILE I rely then, upon that hone&s;ty of intention, which is it|&s;elf the be&s;t apology for its errors, permit me to employ the pre&s;ent hour, which your united voices have annually made &s;acred to the commemoration of our country's wrongs, in recapitulating the mo&s;t injurious of her &s;ufferings, among which that on the tragical fifth of <HI>March</HI> is by no means the lea&s;t, and in recounting the ble&s;&s;ings
<PB N="6" REF="017606_0005_0FA1DCB7395FF918">which have followed from mea&s;ures as really di&s;graceful to tho&s;e who adopted them, as they were intentionally de&s;tructive to tho&s;e again&s;t whom they were levelled.</P>
<P>A NATION falling from tho&s;e great principles of ju&s;tice and virtue which had made her re&s;pectable; &s;ubverting the boa&s;ted improvements of her arts to the &s;avage purpo&s;es of revenge; with venality and corruption entrenched on her cabinet; affords a &s;pecta|cle too &s;erious for the amu&s;ement of the beholder. He turns for relief to the annals of tho&s;e people who&s;e ma&s;culine virtues have ob&s;tinately, will he not &s;ay wi&s;ely? re&s;i&s;ted the refinement of a civilized world. But from the misfortunes of &s;uch a nation much is to be learned. As &s;he is hurried onwards by the vortex of that immea&s;urable gulph in which empires &s;ink to ri&s;e no more, let her &s;erve us as a &s;ignal to avoid the fir&s;t impul&s;e of its re&s;i&s;tle&s;s tide.</P>
<P>TO trace Great Britain through the whole progre&s;s of her ambi|tion in this country, would be to &s;tep back to a very early period: for, long before &s;he avowed her &s;y&s;tem of colonial &s;lavery in the Stamp-Act, the liberties of our ance&s;tors had endured the mo&s;t a|larming innovations from her throne. Without cau&s;e and with|out notice &s;he had invalidated their charters; laid impo&s;itions upon their trade; attempted a mo&s;t dangerous influence over their in|ternal government, by endeavouring to make it independent of the people;&mdash;and all this with the &s;ame confidence as though her po|licy and fore&s;ight, and not her per&s;ecutions, had &s;ettled them on this &s;ide the Atlantic.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017606_0006_0FA1DCB7C9796E28">
BUT the full di&s;play of her de&s;potic policy was re&s;erved to add accumulated di&s;grace to the inglorious reign of the Third George. Then, intoxicated with the idea of taxing <HI>America,</HI> &s;he &s;lumbered upon the tottering pillars of her own con&s;titution; the hand of &s;lavery rocked her at &s;he lied on the giddy height; fal&s;hood gilded her vi&s;ions and bound her &s;en&s;es with the enchantment of &s;ucce&s;s; while her blind ambition alone remained awake, to mi&s;direct the ordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fortune, and to make her fall equally certain and complete.</P>
<P>THE genius of Britain once interred, the fir&s;t &s;pectre which &s;hot from its tomb was the Stamp-Act. This promulgation of a &s;cheme &s;o repugnant to the fundamental principles of the late Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution, announced the fall, but did not obliterate the me|mory of that much re&s;pected &s;y&s;tem in this country. <HI>America</HI> &s;aw the act bore not a &s;ingle feature of its reputed parent, and hav|ing detected its illigitimacy, effectually re&s;i&s;ted its operation. But, as though conviction mu&s;t ever be productive of ob&s;tinacy, Britain de&s;i&s;ted not to rend in pieces the charters of her colonies, which &s;erved to remind her of the violence &s;he committed on her own.

For, when we con&s;ider the number of her victories; the di&s;advantages under which they were obtained; with the chain of important con&s;equences which depended upon the very moment of their deci&s;ion; who but mu&s;t acknowledge, after allowing to our military actors every thing he|roi&s;m can claim, that there appeared peculiar marks of more than human a&s;&s;i&s;tance? The &s;urrender of entire armies to a power which they affected to look upon rather as an object of their chains than of their &s;words, was a degree of glory no enemy that ever pa&s;|&s;ed the Roman yoke afforded to that republic.

<P>AMERICA once unfettered, nobly relied upon the uprightne&s;s of her cau&s;e and the bravery of her &s;ons. But, as though the vir|tues of one crown were to apologi&s;e for the mercile&s;s cruelty of another, a monarch, equally wi&s;e in council as brilliant and power|ful in arms, met her in an alliance which mu&s;t ever enliven her gratitude; exalt the honor of France; and, we tru&s;t too, promote the intere&s;t of both.</P>
<P>AMONG the advantages which have ari&s;en from the&s;e great events to the people of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> that of &s;ecuring their lives, their liberties, and property, the great object of all civil govern|ment, by a con&s;titution of their own framing, is not to be account|ed the lea&s;t. Di&s;membered from a government, which had long &s;tood by the exacte&s;t balance of its powers even again&s;t the corrup|tion of its mini&s;ters, they found them&s;elves accu&s;tomed to princi|ples, which age had &s;tamped with authority, and patriots &s;ealed with their blood. The cau&s;e of their &s;eparation had taught them the avenues through which de&s;poti&s;m in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the community, and pointed out the means of excluding it. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances they produced a &s;y&s;tem which, we tru&s;t, ex|perience will evince to be an improvement

<P>LET us not tru&s;t to laws: an uncorrupted people can exi&s;t without them; a corrupted people cannot long exi&s;t with them, or any other human a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

The body politic once di&s;|tempered, they may indeed be u&s;ed as a crutch to &s;upport it a-while, but they can never heal it. <HI>Rome,</HI> when her bravery conquered the neighbouring nations, and united them to her own empire, was free from all danger within, becau&s;e her armies being urged on by a love for their country would as readily &s;uppre&s;s an internal as an external enemy. In tho&s;e times &s;he made no &s;cruple to throw out her kings who had abu&s;ed their power. But when her &s;ubjects fought not for the advantage of the Commonwealth; when they thronged to the A&s;iatic wars for the &s;poils they produced, and pre|ferred pro&s;tituting the rights of citizen&s;hip upon any barbarian that demanded them, to meeting him in the field for their &s;upport; then <HI>Rome</HI> grew too mode&s;t to accept from the hands of a dictator tho&s;e rights which &s;he ought to have impaled him for daring to invade. No alteration in her laws merely, could have effected this. Had &s;he remained virtuous, &s;he might as well have expelled her dictators as her kings. But what laws can &s;ave a people who for the very purpo&s;e of en&s;laving them&s;elves, chu&s;e to con&s;ider them rather as councils which they may accept or refu&s;e, than as precepts
