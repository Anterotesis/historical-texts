<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the &s;cheme of the covenant of grace be true, in the light in which I have handled it, the importance of &s;omething of this kind, will I pre&s;ume, be a &s;ufficient apology for my undertak|ing; provided I had been able to do it in a good form. As to the form, I &s;hall only &s;ay, I have been &s;o &s;traitened in time, that I could hardly think of any thing but matter, not manner.</P>
<P>If this &s;cheme is not true, I can only tell the world I thought it was true; and though this is a poor way of apologizing for error; yet it is as good as any I can make; and there are but few can make a better apology, not only for what they do and &s;ay, but write too, in many ca&s;es; if they can &s;o good. If any are di&s;po&s;ed to think it not true, who yet count them&s;elves able to refute it; I &s;hall take it very unkind, not to attempt it: But whoever &s;hall attempt to refute this general &s;cheme of the co|venant of grace, I beg will con&s;ider well the affair; for it he don't convince me, he may expect, if God &s;pare me long enough, I &s;hall endeavour to rack his thoughts, let who will be tortured by it. Such a &s;cheme promi&s;es too much advantage, to be ea&s;ily &s;ubmitted; though every thing untrue, ought to &s;ubmit. I beg all &s;ocieties will endeavour to weigh what has been &s;aid, without prejudice, as much as may be; and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, a friend and well-wi&s;her to each of you.</P>

<HEAD>PREDESTINATION Con&s;i&s;tent with General Liberty, OR THE Scheme of the Covenant of Grace.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>_WITH re&s;pect to the grace of the covenant: I u&s;e the word <HI>Grace,</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>freely,</HI> and &s;o to exclude merit, or the de&s;ert of the Creature, (which I under&s;tand to be the common acceptation of the word grace in Divinity) now there are but two ways of meriting or de&s;erving that I know of, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Condignity</HI> and <HI>Congruity:</HI> Merit of condignity is the gi|ving as much, or doing as much for any thing as it is worth, therefore this kind of <HI>merit</HI> never had any place in religion; for who among mo&s;t perfect creatures, even of the cele&s;tial order, could give or do as much for hea|ven and glory as they are worth? or who among the guilty race of fallen men, can do as much for God, as
<PB N="2" REF="008874_0004_103093A7C99FD630">to de&s;erve his own ju&s;tification? or that God &s;hould un|veil his perfections to him, and grant him the free com|munications of his love and mercy, and the gratifying enjoyment of him&s;elf? which is but an early heaven, an earne&s;t upon earth, of that full inheritance above.</P>
<P>Merit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>congruity</HI> is only de&s;erving any thing in order of fitne&s;s or agreeablene&s;s; hence when God created men and angels, in knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holi|ne&s;s, capable to &s;erve and honour him perfectly; it was but fit or &s;uitable to di&s;play his glory and perfections to them, and promi&s;e them the full enjoyment of him&s;elf in an eternal heavenly &s;tate, corre&s;pondent to their &s;erving him perfectly as probationers for a time. Now this merit of <HI>congruity</HI> was the condition of the fir&s;t covenant, but hath no place in the &s;econd, or covenant of <HI>grace:</HI> for &s;uch defilement, imperfection, and iniquity, cleaves to the be&s;t of our &s;ervices, as renders it intirely un&s;uitable, that the <HI>doers of them &s;hould be ju&s;tified</HI> or &s;aved on their account: on the contrary, we de&s;erve eternal dam|nation for their in perfections: hence <HI>without &s;hedding of blood is no remi&s;&s;ion, and heavenly things mu&s;t be purified. Heb</HI> ix. 22, 23. Agreeable to the ancient repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t by the high prie&s;t. <HI>Exo.</HI> xxviii, 38. <HI>That Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the chil|dren of I&s;rael &s;hall hallow in all their holy gifts,</HI> &amp;c. Now if every po&s;&s;ible way of meriting, be excluded (as we &s;ee) from the covenant of grace, ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, (as to any thing we can do) mu&s;t be freely be&s;towed, as is declared, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii 24. <HI>Being ju&s;tified freely by his grace;</HI> and vi. 23. <HI>The gift of God is eter|nal life.</HI> And if the gift of God is eternal life, &s;urely eternal life is God's gift; and what can be more free than a gift? Suppo&s;e, when the &s;econd covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him with his po&s;terity, they had (for the time en&s;uing) been rendered capable to &s;erve God per|fectly, &s;o that it would have been congruous to give them heaven on that account, (which is far from the true &s;tate of things) yet &s;uch a covenant could not be a covenant of
<PB N="3" REF="008874_0005_103093A976E9B958">grace, but of debt, and what could compen&s;ate for time pa&s;s'd, and injuries done? A &s;ervant who&s;e time and whole ability is due to his ma&s;ter, can never make up black days, or compen&s;ate for injuries. Hence, it became infinitely rea&s;onable, that the new covenant &s;hould exclude every kind of merit, and be founded upon another cove|nant, viz. that of redemption; which is a covenant to repair breaches, and demands the taking of life, &s;hedding of blood, and a complete &s;atisfaction for injuries done to infinite honours; which &s;atisfaction, the life and blood of all mere creatures, could not make in a finite time; there|fore it mu&s;t be the blood of the &s;on of God, who is con|&s;idered as a <HI>Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world. Rev.</HI> xiii. 8. Here God appoints him&s;elf another &s;eed (not in&s;tead of <HI>Abel</HI> whom <HI>Cain</HI> &s;lew, but) in&s;tead of <HI>Adam,</HI> whom the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;lew: hence, when the &s;econd covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him with his po&s;|terity, as he was made a foederal or covenant father, this &s;eed is &s;poken of, as one to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, who&s;e blood is the foundation upon which a covenant of grace can be made with man; hence called <HI>the blood of the covenant or te&s;tament. Luke</HI> xxii. 20. <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 20. <HI>Ex.</HI> xxiv. 8.</P>
<P>Secondly. I was to &s;hew, that all men are included in this covenant: And in order to this,</P>
<P N="1">1. I ob&s;erve, that this covenant was e&s;tabli&s;hed to and with <HI>Adam;</HI> for it was made immediately after the fall, before <HI>Adam</HI> had a &s;on, as appears <HI>Gen</HI> iii. 15. Now al|though &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, when the covenant of grace was made, all was pa&s;s'd by but the elect; yet I have never under&s;tood that tho&s;e per&s;ons held <HI>Adam</HI> to be pa&s;s'd by, as a non-elect; but that it has generally been believed he was of the cho&s;en, and was &s;aved. Now it appears alto|gether unrea&s;onable to me, to &s;uppo&s;e, that God would choo&s;e him who had betrayed &s;o great a tru&s;t, and done &s;uch infinite injury to God and his own po&s;terity, and pa&s;s by &s;ome of his po&s;terity, who had only &s;inned in
<PB N="4" REF="008874_0006_103093AC51043B50">his repre&s;entation: choo&s;e the ruiner, and pa&s;s'd by the ruined. Surely &s;uch are not the mo&s;t grateful repre&s;en|tations of him, who declares <HI>he has no plea&s;ure in the death of a &s;inner!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It appears infinitely rea&s;onable to me to &s;uppo&s;e, (that as <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;u&s;tained &s;o great a relation to his po&s;|terity in the fir&s;t covenant, as to be their repre&s;entative for life and death, heaven and hell, and had actually ruin'd them all) when God conde&s;cends to covenant with him again, that if it be po&s;&s;ible, God will give him &s;ome &s;uch relation to his po&s;terity, as &s;hall let him &s;ee, they are not damn'd barely on his account; and nothing &s;hort of making him a foederal father, could make &s;uch a di&s;co|very to him; for as there can be but one covenant of grace, &s;o if that doth not propo&s;e, and promi&s;e &s;alvation to his &s;eed (who are yet unborn) as well as to him&s;elf, he can &s;ee no way for their &s;alvation at all: And O how gloomy and melancholy a con&s;ideration mu&s;t be inferred, if <HI>Adam</HI> under&s;tood the covenant as many do in the&s;e days! <HI>&s;ci.</HI> that the greater part of his po&s;terity was pa&s;s'd by in making the covenant, reprobated, and left to pe|ri&s;h in a ruin that him&s;elf had brought upon them. Such a &s;tate of things, &s;eems to be hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the comfort of that good man, when we con&s;ider the im|portance of his relation to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="3">3. But we are &s;ure it was po&s;&s;ible for God to make &s;uch a covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> as to confer on his po&s;terity foederal holine&s;s, or a new covenant relation of &s;on&s;hip to God; for &s;uch a form of covenanting was after exempli|fied with <HI>Abraham;</HI> and &s;urely that form of covenanting was according to the original pattern. The form of co|venanting with <HI>Abraham,</HI> we know, was, that the whole family are included; father, &s;on, &s;ervant born in his hou&s;e, or bought with his money of the &s;tranger, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii 12, 13. The unborn &s;eed of both are included in the covenant, and if they are not dealt with as &s;uch, the covenant was null and void with re&s;pect to them, ver. 14. Yea, the females are incovenanted with the males,
<PB N="5" REF="008874_0007_103093B05F306000">(as I could abundantly prove, was it denied) tho' inca|pable of the formal external ratification of the covenant by circumci&s;ion. I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent, but that the females in <HI>I&s;ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> were ever treated as God's co|venant people; and the daughters might not marry with the uncircumci&s;ed. <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxiv. 14. Now that God did &s;o covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> as to include all his po&s;terity, will appear, if we con&s;ider a few things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we have no Hint of any covenant made with <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;eed, <HI>&s;ci. Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel;</HI> yet they are God's covenant children; for it belongs to none but &s;uch, to u&s;e the modes of the admini&s;tration of the covenant of grace; and offerings and &s;acrifices have no relation to any other covenant. We are &s;ure God in&s;tituted this &s;ervice, and enjoined it them either immediately him&s;elf, or mediately by their fathers, who alone can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be their in&s;tructors in this ca&s;e, as <HI>Gen.</HI> iv. 3, 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. We read nothing of any <HI>coming into the pre&s;ence of the Lord,</HI> but only of <HI>going out:</HI> Now the place of God's pre&s;ence is the church, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxxxii. 13, 14. There is abundant proof of this in the word of God; and <HI>Cain</HI>'s <HI>going out</HI> from the pre&s;ence of God, can mean nothing el&s;e but apo&s;tacy from God, and throwing off the yoke of a covenant re|lation to him; which <HI>Cain</HI> could not have done, had he not been a church member: and where did <HI>Cain</HI> &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a capacity, but from the terms of the covenant, <HI>the father and the child?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That. the&s;e were the terms of the covenant, will appear in <HI>Seth</HI>'s family, who are all called children of God throughout their generations, until the flood, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi 2.</ITEM>
</LIST> <HI>The &s;ons of God &s;aw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of the daughters of men.</HI> By <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> can be under&s;tood no other than <HI>Seth</HI>'s po&s;terity; and by <HI>daughters of men, Cain</HI>'s; in which account we can't but know, male and female of the former, are God's children, and neither male nor female of the latter; for &s;urely it was lawful for the &s;ons of <HI>Seth</HI> to marry. But if the daughters of <HI>Seth</HI> were not daughters of God al&s;o, they had none but
<PB N="6" REF="008874_0008_103093B38CC87DD0">daughters of men to marry with; which we &s;ee was un|lawful: and con&s;equently, it was as unlawful, for the daughters of God, or of <HI>Seth</HI>'s po&s;terity, to marry with the &s;ons of men, or of <HI>Cain</HI>'s po&s;terity. But how came <HI>Seth</HI>'s po&s;terity to be children of God, above <HI>Cain</HI>'s? It was not their being regenerated, or their pious and vir|tuous living: no, it is the wickedne&s;s of the&s;e &s;ons of God, that is mention'd as the cau&s;e, why God will de&s;troy men from off the earth by a flood, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 2, to 13, <HI>and God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth;</HI> while <HI>Noah only was found righteous in his generation,</HI> chap. vii. 1. "Their &s;on &s;hip therefore above the po&s;terity of <HI>Cain,</HI> could he no other than a covenant relation from their father <HI>Adam,</HI> which <HI>Cain</HI> and his po&s;terity had forfeited and lo&s;t, by his <HI>going out from the pre&s;ence of the Lord</HI> God was willing <HI>Cain</HI> &s;hould have his proper primogeniture, or place of fir&s;t born; which <HI>Cain</HI> &s;eemeth to &s;u&s;pect, by the manner of God's &s;peak|ing to him, <HI>if thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? and unto thee &s;hall be his de&s;ire, and thou &s;halt rule over him,</HI> Gen. iv. 7. and when <HI>Cain</HI> had &s;lain leis brother, God did not excommunicate him, but brands him with going out voluntarily; <HI>Cain went out from the pre&s;ence of the Lord,</HI> Gen iv. 16.</P>
<P>By all which we learn, how unwilling God was, there &s;hould be a generation of heathen, or uncovenanted people; and we &s;ee how highly God re&s;ents that heathen race, di&s;claims all relation to them, calls them &s;ons of men, and will even drown his own children for marrying with them. &mdash; 4. If <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> became church-members, from the very nature of the covenant, <HI>the fa|ther and his &s;eed;</HI> then they being God's covenant chil|dren, their &s;eed's right cannot be denied; and &s;o the right of church member&s;hip, and a covenant relation to God, runs to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed's &s;eed forever; as was exemplified in <HI>Seth</HI>'s po&s;terity: for altho' they were generally de&s;troyed by the flood, yet not individually, <HI>Noah</HI> being found righteous in that generation, his &s;eed's right after the flood, is as

After the flood God &s;pake to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his &s;ons with him, &s;aying, <HI>and I, behold, I e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant with you, and with your &s;eed after you,</HI> Gen. ix. 8, 9 Here the &s;eed are ex|pre&s;&s;ed, with a covenant e&s;tabli&s;hed with them, as fully as with the parents; and what comfortable encourage|ment, without this, could there be, <HI>to be fruitful, and multiply, and repleni&s;h the earth?</HI> ver. 1 and 7, or fill it, as the word <HI>repleni&s;h</HI> &s;ignifies: and God's ble&s;&s;ing <HI>Noah</HI> and his &s;ons, with the &s;ubjection of bea&s;ts, or a dominion over them, could yield but cold comfort, if their &s;eed are not the ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord with them; but we &s;ee they were: and here the whole world are the church again; and their &s;eed after them, as ver. 9, are all the human creatures that ever &s;hall be born.</P>
<P N="5">5. If infants did not belong to the original draught of the covenant of grace, but mu&s;t be taken in upon their own actual believing, when come to years; then their covenant relation to God, in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s day, was an
<PB N="8" REF="008874_0010_103093B812B04D40">appendant of the Theocracy that he was under, and mu&s;t be aboli&s;hed with it, and then where is our right to infant bapti&s;m? However, I think the ca&s;e is out of all doubt, from the rea&s;ons and arguments already u&s;ed, that the covenant was made and e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Adam,</HI> and his in|fant &s;eed; and as all, male and female, are his de&s;cendants; &s;o the covenant of grace includes all, as really as ever the covenant of works did: it is no more a rea&s;on, that the heathen are not in the covenant of grace, becau&s;e they receive no actual benefit from it, than it is, that all were not in the covenant of works, becau&s;e they reap no ad|vantage. For we &s;ee, children can as well be bereaved of foederal holine&s;s, in the covenant of grace, by parents' mi&s;conduct, as of real holine&s;s in the covenant of works, by the mi&s;conduct of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. I was to &s;hew, that the covenant of grace is conditional.</P>
<P>But before I come directly to the point, I will premi&s;e a few things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That a covenant mu&s;t exi&s;t before it can be conditional; therefore, what God doth for man, before a covenant is made with him, cannot be obtained by any condition to be done on man's part; for condi|tions &s;uppo&s;e a covenant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That a covenant mu&s;t (as it is a compact by which God and men are to conduct them&s;elves, by obligations) be fairly exhibited, and the terms under&s;tood, and &s;uch as can be complied with, and are &s;uitable to be complied with.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The covenanting parties mu&s;t know they are parties concerned; otherwi&s;e the covenant is a counterfeit and, cheat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. A covenant mu&s;t be ratified, or e&s;tabli&s;hed, in order to its being obligatory, on the parties concerned. The &s;ealing of a covenant, cannot be a condition of that covenant, becau&s;e it is not binding 'till it be ratified: a covenant may be owned and confirmed, and yet not one condition of it ever performed, and all the good condi|tionally

<P>I now come directly to the proof of the third thing propo&s;ed, viz. That the covenant of grace is conditional. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w all mu&s;t allow, that this is the only covenant, in which life and &s;alvation is propo&s;ed, and promi&s;ed to any of the children of men; the only covenant in which he treats with them about life and happine&s;s; and that it is fairly exhibited, and the terms intelligible and rea&s;onable; that the parties concerned are God and the vi&s;ible Church, between both the parties: Hence I query, how are God's covenant people, or the vi&s;ible church, to expect life and &s;alvation?

And here I &s;hall examine this di&s;tinction, between <HI>Reality,</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;ibility.</HI> To be <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> in covenant, is to be in covenant, &s;o as to be &s;een in covenant: but if they are not <HI>really</HI> there, they cannot be &s;een there; and vi&s;ible church-member&s;hip, is a mere imaginary idea, <HI>i. e.</HI> a nothing.

<P>If God tells me, that <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church members, tho' un|regenerate, are in the covenant of grace; I think I do well to believe, he &s;aw them <HI>really</HI> there; or mu&s;t I be|lieve, he tells me of that which hath no <HI>reality?</HI> God &s;aith, the &s;ons of <HI>Seth</HI> were his &s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urely none will &s;ay they were regenerate; for <HI>Noah</HI> only was found righteous in that generation, <HI>Gen.</HI> vii. 1.

Now this circum&s;tance, the apo&s;tle makes an allegorical figure of two covenants; and the point of light in which he talks, is this: The promi&s;e being to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his &s;eed, <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> being &s;uch, &s;eemed as tho' he was an heir; but he is not: <HI>Ca&s;t him out; for the &s;on of the bond woman &s;hall not be heir, with the &s;on of the free woman,</HI> Gal. iv. 30. Now, how doth this an&s;wer to <HI>Jeru&s;alem?</HI> as ver. 25. Why, as God made but one covenant with the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or the twelve tribes; and that a covenant of promi&s;e: &s;o it would &s;eem a tho' all mu&s;t be heirs of promi&s;e; but they are not: Why? They adhere to a law covenant; &s;o cannot be heirs with tho&s;e that adhere to the go&s;pel, or covenant of grace: And as <HI>Agar</HI>'s &s;eed was rejected, in the making the covenant; &s;o &s;uch as adhere to a law covenant, are rejected in the execution of the covenant of grace; for this rea&s;on: They are the children of a bond covenant;
<PB N="27" REF="008874_0029_103093EF9C0ED898">and not of a free, or go&s;pel covenant; though &s;uch only was the covenant God made with them.

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

To choo&s;e a per&s;on for &s;alvation, is one thing; but to cho&s;e a way in which to &s;ave him, is another, though both are according to the eternal purpo&s;e of God. That God hath cho&s;en a certain number for &s;alvation, is certain; but the way cho&s;en wherein to &s;ave them, may be a way for all to be &s;aved, notwith&s;tanding God cho&s;e a certain number of angels for eternal happine&s;s
<PB N="31" REF="008874_0033_103093FB76D402C0">from eternity; but the way to that happine&s;s was a way for them all to obtain it. Now it could an&s;wer no end at all, as to the apo&s;tle's de&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> to bring people to adhere to the go&s;pel covenant; to tell them, one out of five was. elected, and four our of five reprobated from eternity: Children of the fle&s;h, but not of promi&s;e; of the <HI>bond,</HI> but not of the <HI>free</HI> woman; though all vi&s;ibly in the &s;ame; yea, it mu&s;t entirely fru&s;trate his de&s;ign; for according to that; they might adhere to the go&s;pel covenant, and be children of the bond woman neverthe|le&s;s. Therefore the apo&s;tle hath no de&s;ign here, to &s;peak, neither doth he, about elect, or reprobate per&s;ons in the church, as one being a child of promi&s;e more than the other; but only as they are attached, to a law, or go&s;pel covenant; and this exactly agreeth with the other in&s;tance: Hence, when he &s;peaks of election, it is only with regard to <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> as certain in&s;tances, whereby to point out the way, in which God from eternity purpo&s;ed to &s;ave &s;inners; <HI>which is, not of works but of him that calleth,</HI> ver. 11. Here the apo&s;tle in order to promote his general and grand de&s;ign, of bringing profe&s;&s;ors to adhere to the go&s;pel covenant; and to &s;hew that election, and ju&s;tification is purely of grace; takes notice that <HI>Jacob</HI> was cho&s;en to be the &s;eed, (with whom God would e&s;tabli&s;h his covenant) before he was born, or had done good or evil; by which he e&s;tabli&s;heth this doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> that man's good work &s;hall have no more hand in meriting, or de&s;erving his own election, ju&s;tification, and eternal happine&s;s, than as though he had never done any good at all, This doctrine they that adhered, or were attached to a law covenant did not believe; as appears, <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 32. <HI>They &s;ought righteou&s;ne&s;s by the works of the law,</HI> and <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 4. <HI>Who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the law, are fallen from grace,</HI> chap. iv. 21. <HI>Tell me, ye that de&s;ire to be under the law,</HI> &amp;c. And not believing this doctrine, they are children of the fle&s;h, and of the bond-woman, for that they adhered to a bond-covenant: But no becau&s;e they were not elected, or

But po&s;&s;ibily &s;ome body waits to a&s;k me this difficult que&s;tion. <HI>Why was</HI> I&s;hmael <HI>and</HI> E&s;au <HI>ca&s;t out of, or rejected from the covenant, &s;eeing infants belong to the</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>above, and are the children of promi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> Though I am wearied with difficult que&s;tions, yet I will endeavour to give &s;ome account of this affair. And here let us con&s;ider what God was doing in the early ages of the world; and let me &s;ay, to all bodies there mu&s;t be a head; in all families there mu&s;t be a patriarch; in all kingdoms there mu&s;t be a &s;upreme; in all &s;tates there mu&s;t be a law giver; and to all branches there mu&s;t be a root: Now as in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s family, God e&s;tabli&s;heth a divine government, or a theocracy, he made him&s;elf head, king, and law giver to them, both as a church, and as a &s;tate; thus he gives them laws about dividing lands, and &s;ettling bounds, &s;ee <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xv. 13. read chap. xvi. and xvii. However God makes <HI>Abra|ham</HI> and his family, the metropolis of the nation. This was the &s;overeign plea&s;ure of God; for he might have given this preferment, to <HI>Nahor,</HI> or <HI>Haran, Abraham</HI>'s brother; but it can't be the priviledge of each of them. Here God honours <HI>Abraham</HI> with the promi&s;e, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould de&s;cend from him; makes him, as it were, his bo&s;om friend; undertakes to give laws to him and him family; and from them &s;hall laws be propagated in the world; e&s;pecially religious laws: <HI>To them were committed the oracles of God:</HI> Rom. iii. 2. And the law mu&s;t go forth of <HI>Zion,</HI> and the word of the Lord from <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Here God makes him the father of all na|tions, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. The root of the church, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 17. So that if any will be members, <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they mu&s;t take hold of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant, be grafted into it, and receive divine ble&s;&s;ings from him patrimony, for there is the root and fatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="008874_0035_10309402718FF918">
Before <HI>Abraham</HI>'s day, God made choice of no parti|cular family, to whom he would give laws, &s;o as that all the world &s;hould receive the mind of God from that fa|mily only. And this was not a privilege he him&s;elf ob|tained in a covenant way; for God made no covenant before; that if he would do &s;o or &s;o, he would make a covenant with him, in which he &s;hould be the father, fir&s;t of the <HI>Jew,</HI> and after of the <HI>Gentile</HI> al&s;o. Now to make a covenant of &s;alvation with a people is one thing; but to put particular preferment upon &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons in that covenant, is another: And the <HI>Gentile</HI> church can never have that preferment, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church had; until God de&s;troy <HI>Abraham</HI>'s patrimony: <HI>Thou beare&s;t not the root, but the root thee, Rom.</HI> xi. 18. Here I am prepared to &s;ay; when <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> and <HI>E&s;au</HI> are &s;poken of as rejected, there is no appearance that the were ca&s;t out of the co|venant of grace, for that was the common priviledge of all that had a de&s;ire to be in it; and they were in it by God's command, <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 10, 23. And if they are turned out, it is upon their own default; but not before <HI>E&s;au</HI> was born, <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. ii. Here then when <HI>Jacob</HI> is &s;poken of, as being cho&s;en before he was born, it hath no relation to his election for heaven, (tho' he might be one of that election too) but of his being cho&s;en to be a father of the church, and of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> and hence in honour to him, he is called &s;o, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 28, and ix. 5. Now, as the promi&s;e to <HI>Abraham,</HI> viz. that God would be a God to him, and his &s;eed after him; did not bind God to confer the particular preferment of patriarch, on one of <HI>Abra|braham</HI>'s, or <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s children, more than the other; God, as a &s;overeign, makes the di&s;tinction, and di&s;covers he has done it in re&s;pect of <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s children, before they are born, or have done good or evil, in the&s;e words, <HI>The elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger.</HI> This therefore, of chu&s;ing <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> was no more done in a covenant way, than the chu&s;ing of <HI>Abraham</HI> him&s;elf: For the promi&s;e that God would be a God to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his &s;eed, was as much in favour of one child as the other; and as to
<PB N="34" REF="008874_0036_1030940599BC3608">particular preferment, God, as &s;overeign, could di&s;po&s;e of it in an unconditional way; whereas a covenant always &s;uppo&s;eth conditions. And God's chu&s;ing <HI>Jacob,</HI> before he had done good, was an excellent argument to e&s;tabli&s;h the covenant of grace; and to bring profe&s;&s;ors to adhere to it.

That men need not expect by all the good they can do, to de&s;erve a reward of glory and happine&s;s: And this an&s;wered the de&s;ign of di&s;&s;uading them from adhering to a law covenant. If he had meant to tell them, that there was no odds, they might as well believe one thing as another; or do one thing as
<PB N="37" REF="008874_0039_1030940BCD0EB278">another; or nothing, as they plea&s;ed, before they were regenerated; this could be no argument to per&s;uade them to adhere to the go&s;pel covenant, in order to be re|generated: Therefore, to &s;hew mercy, means to deny merit; and to will, and run, means running in a law covenant; and there is no promi&s;e to &s;uch, to be &s;ure: For &s;uch are the children of the bond woman; and will be harden'd if they don't bring forth fruits meet for re|pentance; for however they they may think to &s;ay, they have <HI>Abraham</HI> to their father, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey have <HI>Agar</HI> to their mo|ther; and all &s;uch are enemies to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And this concludes with ver. 17.

As God had de&s;igned to bring <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to great honour, &s;o, as a &s;overeign God, he de&s;igned to bring them fir&s;t into great affliction and bondage; and bring them out with a &s;tretched out arm; and appoints <HI>Pharoah</HI> to be the pri&s;on-keeper: But what is all this to the apo&s;tle's purpo&s;e? but only to &s;hew, that God has a &s;overeign right to do what he plea&s;es, with &s;uch as adhere to a law covenant: They are more re|lated to God than heathen <HI>Pharoah;</HI> they are in the hands of ju&s;tice; and God may harden them as he plea&s;|eth; for they refu&s;e to adhere to the covenant that hath mercy in it; and this was a good argument to bring pro|fe&s;&s;ors to adhere to a go&s;pel covenant.

And now we &s;ee with what con&s;i&s;tency the apo&s;tle could rai&s;e his lamentation over his kin&s;men, who were <HI>I&s;raelites, Rom.</HI> ix. 2. <HI>whom God had planted a noble vine, wholly a right &s;eed,</HI> Jer. ii. 21. when he made them children of promi&s;e in the covenant of grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 4 in cove|nanting with their father <HI>Abraham;</HI> and had conferred on them the glory of preferment, <HI>to whom pertaineth the glory,</HI> ver. ix. who now are turned into the degenerate plant, of &s;trange <HI>Agarenes;</HI> had laid their honour in the du&s;t, by &s;eeking righteou&s;ne&s;s by the works of the law, ver. 32. But if he had under&s;tood, all the&s;e children of the flesh were reprobates, by an eternal decree; and no &s;alvation provided for them in the covenant of grace, his lamentation mu&s;t have been, an impious confronting of God's decrees; and he could never &s;ay, the rea&s;on why they peri&s;hed, was becau&s;e they did not &s;eek righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith; for if they were &s;o reprobated, they mu&s;t perish &s;eek what way they will.

<P>But now let us take the objection, and &s;ee what we &s;hall make of it, in the light in which it is u&s;ed. <HI>Children of the fle&s;h, are not the children of God; but the children of promi&s;e are.</HI> Now as this objection is brought to deny, that regenerating grace is promi&s;ed to all the vi&s;ible go&s;pel church; if it can an&s;wer that end at all, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood thus: By <HI>children of the fle&s;h,</HI> the unrege|nerate or non-elect; and that no &s;uch are the <HI>children of God,</HI> in the covenant of grace, and &s;o not <HI>children of promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Here to prove, that the unregenerate are the children of God, in the covenant of grace, I &s;hall cite but one text, out of one hundred that I could bring to that purpo&s;e; and that is, <HI>Ez.</HI> xvi. 8. <HI>I &s;ware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, &s;aith the Lord God, and thou became&s;t mine.</HI> And that an unregenerated church, are the children of the promi&s;e of regeneration, appears from the nature of the thing; for that regenera|tion cannot be promi&s;ed to the regenerate. 2d. From <HI>Ez.</HI> xxxvi. 26, 27, <HI>A new heart will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you; and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and give you an heart of fle&s;h.</HI> This is a promi&s;e made to them, as being the vi&s;ible church, in covenant, and God's children, and yet unregenerate.</P>
<P>If by <HI>children of the fle&s;h,</HI> the apo&s;tle had a de&s;ign to &s;ignify the non elect, that is as much as to &s;ay, they are not the children of God in the covenant of grace, and there is no provi&s;ion made for their &s;alvation in that covenant; therefore not <HI>children of promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But how is it po&s;&s;ible, that this could be his meaning? Doth not God own all <HI>Seth</HI>'s po&s;terity for <HI>his children,</HI> in the covenant of promi&s;e; and act upon the relation in three fold re&s;pects; 1&s;t, his &s;pirit &s;trives with them; 2d.

<P>To &s;ay, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> hath paid a ran&s;om &s;ufficient for each individual of the human race, if they will &s;in|cerely embrace him by &s;aving faith, by their own natural ability; is to &s;ay this, viz that if men had not lo&s;t their original &s;pirituality, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, to &s;erve God &s;incerely and perfectly, the ran&s;om of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would have been &s;ufficient for each individual of them; <HI>i. e.</HI> it would have been &s;ufficient, if no &s;ufficiency or ran&s;om had been wanting.

And this can't con&s;i&s;t with the kind expre&s;&s;ions of God to the vi&s;ible church, and tho&s;e that peri&s;h out of her. Hence the condition mu&s;t be <HI>po&s;&s;ible to all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> I was to &s;hew, <HI>That regenerating grace is promi&s;ed, to the faith and endeavours of unregenerate men.</HI></P>
<P>I have already proved, that regenerating grace is pro|mi&s;ed; and that it is promi&s;ed conditionally, and not ab|&s;olutely: And al&s;o that it is promi&s;ed to the church, as being unregenerate, yet adhering to a go&s;pel covenant; and that to a regenerate church, it can't be promi&s;ed. Hence then, to who&s;e condition can it be promi&s;ed, but to the condition of unregenerate men? To promi&s;e rege|nerating grace, to a condition done by it&s;elf, mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e, that the per&s;on to whom it is promi&s;ed hath it, and hath it not, at the &s;ame time; unle&s;s a man can be rege|nerated more than once, which I &s;uppo&s;e no per&s;on will a&s;&s;ert. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of being born again once; but not a &s;econd time. <HI>John</HI> iii. 3, But po&s;&s;ibly it will be here a&s;ked, where did God promi&s;e the grace of regeneration, to any individual unregenerate per&s;on or per&s;ons, in &s;uch a manner, as that we can be &s;atisfied, the promi&s;e was made to him or them per&s;onally? To which I an&s;wer, Regenerating grace was implicitly, and by nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence promi&s;ed to <HI>Cain; if thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted?</HI> The acceptation here, can mean no|thing le&s;s, than the acceptation of his brother <HI>Abel,</HI> for God propo&s;eth to prefer him above <HI>Abel,</HI> thou &s;halt rule over him. And the promi&s;e in 2d of <HI>Acts</HI> ver. 39. and <HI>Ez.</HI> xxxvi. 26. are as expre&s;s and per&s;onal, yet condi|tional. But as I &s;hall undertake to prove, that God hath bound him&s;elf to give regenerating grace, to the proper endeavour of unregenerate men: So, all that might be
<PB N="46" REF="008874_0048_103094287693D8F8">more &s;aid to the&s;e texts, will be properly then con&s;idered&punc; therefore I omit further con&s;ideration of them at pre&s;ent&punc; and &s;hall proceed to &s;hew, what the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man is, to which the promi&s;e is &s;o effec|tually made. Now before I come directly to the point, it will be proper to inquire when and how, an unrege|nerate man became an heir of promi&s;e: And as to the time when; it was either when he actually entered as adult age into the covenant of grace by circumci&s;ion, or bapti&s;m; or when he was entered by his parents, ma|&s;ter, or mi&s;tre&s;s in infancy, by either of tho&s;e ordinances: Before <HI>Abraham</HI>'s day, it is mo&s;t probable he was an heir in the covenant, by natural generation, as a de&s;cendant from <HI>Adam,</HI> with whom the covenant was made. As to the manner how he became an heir of promi&s;e; it was by faith; it was by the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> that the covenant became a covenant of promi&s;e; and it was by believing in, owning, and ad|hering to his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the true doctrinal pro|fe&s;&s;ion of it, that made men children of promi&s;e, when they entered into the covenant of grace. As to infants being children of promi&s;e, that was by faith al&s;o, but not their own actual faith. If the parent, ma&s;ter, or mi&s;|tre&s;s had not the true profe&s;&s;ion, of being &s;aved by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of another, viz. the Me&s;&s;iah, or <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they could neither &s;eek their own, nor the &s;alvation of others, by faith; and as God de&s;igned to &s;ave all, &s;mall or great, bond or free, in the way of a gracious cove|nant, and as the an&s;wer of prayer; by faith they mu&s;t &s;eek, and &s;eeking by faith, their own, and their infants' &s;alvation, may be obtained: When children become able to act faith for them&s;elves, as is required. In <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 37. we find, he that will have a new heart, or regeneration, mu&s;t &s;eek for it; and in <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 32, we find it mu&s;t be &s;ought by faith. Now it is for want of under&s;tanding this &s;cripture di&s;tinction of faith, and the &s;tre&s;s that God hath laid upon it, in the covenant of grace, that the chri&s;tian word are in &s;uch confu&s;ion about
<PB N="47" REF="008874_0049_1030942A5C412B68">the covenant of grace, and who are in it; about the pro|mi&s;es, and who are heirs of them. Thus when faith is &s;poken of as a prerequi&s;ite to bapti&s;m; the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> &s;ay, ju&s;tifying faith is intended, and non have right to be in the covenant of grace, by bapti&s;m, but &s;uch as have it, and therefore the unregenerate, and infants are excluded: And then they are obliged, either to deny, that faith was required of the adult <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> as prerequi&s;ite, to entering them into the covenant of grace by circumci&s;ion; or the co|venant being that of grace, in which they were &s;o entered: For if that into which they were entered by circumci&s;ion, was the only covenant of grace; and faith was required of all the adult, as a prerequi&s;ite to being &s;o entered; faith being required of the adult now, can be no argument, that either the unregenerate, or infants are now excluded: and hence they are obliged to confront all the &s;criptures, that &s;peak of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s glory, as being all in the covenant of grace; <HI>holine&s;s unto the Lord; planted wholly a right &s;eed; and the blood of them all wa&s;hed away by being in the covenant of grace, and all heirs of promi&s;e.</HI> See <HI>Jer.</HI> ii. 3, 21. <HI>Ex.</HI> xvi. 8, 9. <HI>Ep.</HI> ii. 12. <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 4. thus they are in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion in &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Now, though the&s;e that hold the right of the adult unregenerate, and infants to bapti&s;m, can &s;ee the con|fu&s;ion of anabapti&s;t &s;entiments; yet when it is &s;aid, that faith, which qualifies a per&s;on for bapti&s;m, or enter|ing into the covenant of grace, makes him an heir of promi&s;e; this they deny, <HI>i. e.</HI> many of them. And what is this, but either to &s;ay, the covenant that faith qualified him to enter into, was not covenant of grace; or if it was, the faith that qualified him to enter in, did did not entitle him to the ble&s;&s;ings of it. And herein will appear the confu&s;ion of this denial: When the&s;e Gen|tlemen are di&s;puting with <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> they will lay great &s;tre&s;s on this faith of an unregenerate man; that it quali|fied <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be in covenant; and qualified the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to come in; and that they were all children of promi&s;e, that were in the covenant by it; and that all the vi&s;ible
<PB N="48" REF="008874_0050_1030942D32A04FD8">church were in glorious circum&s;tances. But when they are di&s;puting with tho&s;e that hold general redemption; this faith is forgot; or it is good for nothing ; he that hrth got it, is not really in covenant; and if he &s;eeks &s;alvation by it, it is not &s;eeking by faith, &amp;c. Hence they confront not only their own arguments, but all the &s;criptures that &s;peak of the vi&s;ible church, in covenant by faith, as being children of promi&s;ed, though unregenerate. Now as I &s;aid, it was for want of under&s;tanding the &s;tre&s;s that God puts on the faith of an unregenerate man, that has been the cau&s;e of much confu&s;ion in the chri&s;tian world, about who are in the covenant, and heirs of pro|mi&s;e. So now I will briefly &s;hew &s;ome part of the im|portance of this faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. By it the chri&s;tian church &s;tood in the covenant of grace; while for the want of it, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church was turned out doors. Becau&s;e of unbelief they were broken off; thou &s;tande&s;t by faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 20. What tongue can expre&s;s the importance of this affair! the <HI>earth</HI> is not only rent and &s;haken, but heaven al&s;o; the <HI>children of the kingdom are ca&s;t out,</HI> Mat. viii. 11, 12. <HI>The fruitful field turned into a barren wilderne&s;s; and the barren wilderne&s;s into a fruitful field.</HI> The wife and children rent from the bo&s;om and bowels of a tender hu&s;band, and compa&s;|&s;ionate father; crying <HI>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart,</HI> Jer. iv. 19. <HI>My heart is turned within me, how &s;hall I give thee up,</HI> Ho&s;. xi. 8.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was by this faith of unregenerate men, the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out of <HI>Egypt, Ex.</HI> iv. 1. viii. 31. kept the pa&s;&s;over; pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ea; and the walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> fell, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 28, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 30. went through the wilderne&s;s; entered the land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and without faith, none of the&s;e things could have been done, <HI>Heb.</HI> iii. 19. <HI>Ex.</HI> iv. 1. And indeed men may have faith to re|move mountains, ca&s;t out devils, and do many wonderful works in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s name, without the faith of regeneration. And as I &s;aid a man is an heir of promi&s;e, when he is in the covenant of faith; and it is his faith, in the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="49" REF="008874_0051_1030943137756B10">of <HI>Chri&s;t profe&s;&s;edly,</HI> that makes him an heir to the promi&s;e of regeneration. Therefore I come now to the point, to &s;hew what is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man. And &s;eeing no adult per&s;on, is a proper heir to the promi&s;e, but only as a <HI>profe&s;t</HI> believer in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as provided for the &s;alva|tion of guilty, &s;inful, and peri&s;hing men; he is, when under the bonds of the covenant of grace, bound (as in a mo&s;t &s;olemn compact ratified) to do, 1&s;t. the <HI>remoter</HI> conditions of regeneration, 2d. the <HI>direct</HI> condition; and both at the expence of an aggravated damnation: Hence it is fit he &s;hould be an heir of promi&s;e. And as there are <HI>remote</HI> conditions, &s;o there are al&s;o <HI>remote</HI> promi&s;es, of &s;uper added a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enable to the performance of the <HI>direct</HI> condition. <HI>I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkne&s;s light before them,</HI> I&s;ai. xlii. 16. <HI>I &s;aid not unto the hou&s;e of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain,</HI> chap. xlv. 19. And were it not that the pro|mi&s;es apprehend him, at the very &s;pot, where faith, and the covenant fir&s;t find him, the promi&s;e would not reach as far as the covenant, and &s;alvation could not be obtain'd in a covenant way. Here then, faith and the covenant find him,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. owning God to be the true, holy, ju&s;t, pow|erful, wi&s;e, and merciful God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Owning him&s;elf a &s;inful, guilty, cur&s;ed, ruin'd, and peri&s;hing creature; that hath no righteou&s;ne&s;s wherewith to appear before, or be reconciled to, this holy, ju&s;t, and powerful God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Owning, God has provided a glorious, all &s;ufficient Saviour, for &s;uch helple&s;s and peri&s;hing creatures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Owning, that as he can by this provi&s;ion, be reconciled to this holy, ju&s;t, and gracious God, &s;o it is his mo&s;t rea|&s;onable &s;ervice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Owning that he is bound in the &s;o|lemn bonds of a gracious covenant, to be reconciled, at the &s;evere&s;t penalty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Owning, God to be his God, in the new covenant; ready, as a tender father, to help his peri&s;hing children.</ITEM>
</LIST> Now take either of the&s;e &s;ix ar|ticles from him, except the &s;econd, and you take from
<PB N="50" REF="008874_0052_103094344C09C598">him, faith, and the covenant of grace. The &s;econd is not a go&s;pel article, and only <HI>enters that the offence may abound,</HI> Rom. v. 20. So that we &s;ee, faith, and the covenant puts a &s;tock into his hand, that can't be put into the hand of a man, out of covenant; nor in covenant, without faith: Hence he that is planted in the covenant by faith, is <HI>planted a noble vine, wholly a right &s;eed,</HI> Jer. ii. 21. Hence then in the &s;pot where this faith, and the covenant of grace find him, and the promi&s;e fir&s;t appre|hends him, there is not more required of him, than he is able to do, and that which, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, he is able to do; is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man; to which &s;uper-added a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is <HI>directly</HI> promi&s;ed, and regenerating grace, <HI>remotely.</HI></P>
<P>This then, is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man; to <HI>&s;et his face Zion-ward,</HI> or in other words, to|wards heaven, going and weeping; this faith and cove|nant &s;tate, hath furni&s;hed him for mourning: For the faith is a confe&s;&s;ion, that God is holy, ju&s;t, and power|ful; and that him&s;elf is vile and peri&s;hing, and can work no acceptable righteou&s;ne&s;s; the covenant &s;ets a dying <HI>Je&s;us</HI> before him, and makes grace and mercy meet, with ju&s;tice and holine&s;s, before his face. Hence it is a part of his proper duty, to look about him, and &s;ee what he can &s;ee; for the view of God's holine&s;s and mercy; of a bleeding <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and of his own vilene&s;s; are proper objects to excite deep and ju&s;t &s;orrow. Repentance is the fir&s;t proper duty in the covenant of grace, after a man is entered; for faith mu&s;t bring him in. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s bapti&s;m, is a bapti&s;m of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; not but that he ought to repent or &s;orrow, before he enters, if it is at adult age; but when entered, if un|regenerate, it is a condition of the covenant. And as he is to <HI>mourn,</HI> &s;o he is earne&s;tly to <HI>pray,</HI> and &s;eek the Lord early. Neither &s;orrowing, or praying, will do alone. And how graciou&s;ly hath God promi&s;ed to hear the &s;or|rowing prayer of his own children in covenant. How gladly doth he regard their &s;orrowful cry, when they cry
<PB N="51" REF="008874_0053_103094361A393220">for convicting and converting grace. <HI>I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf; and &s;aying, turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned. Is Ephraim my dear &s;on? I he a plea&s;ant child? for &s;ince I &s;pake again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till; therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will &s;urely have mercy on him, &s;aith the Lord God, Jer.</HI> xxxi. 18, 19, 20. See 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xv. 2. and <HI>Prov.</HI> viii. 17. <HI>Tho&s;e that &s;eek me early, &s;hall find me.</HI></P>
<P>As it is the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man, to pray and mourn, &s;o he ought to u&s;e the means God hath appointed for his help; &s;uch as fa&s;ting, meditation, &s;elf-examination, attend on all the publick means of grace; and however men have embarra&s;&s;ed this affair, with not rightly under&s;tanding God's mind in his word; yet un|doubtedly it is the duty of all in the covenant of grace, by the faith I am &s;peaking of, to draw near the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>table.</HI> God enjoined the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church to u&s;e all the re|pre&s;entations of a dying &s;aviour; and nothing can be more &s;triking, than to behold the &s;ymbols of his dying love, nothing that hath &s;o much tendency, to cau&s;e us to <HI>look on Je&s;us whom we have pierced, and mourn for him, Zech.</HI> xii. 10. But to proceed; it is the duty of unrege|nerate men, to be much in &s;ecret prayer; and to take care they don't quench the &s;triving of God's &s;pirit. This was a &s;in of the antediluvian world of God's children, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 3. God's &s;pirit will &s;trive with God's covenant people, until he gives them up to hardne&s;s of heart; and then their covenant &s;tate, is left to them de&s;olate. <HI>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man. Ye do always re&s;i&s;t the holy gho&s;t, as your fathers did, Acts</HI> vii. 51. <HI>Be|hold your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate, Matt.</HI> xxiii. 38. Al&s;o it is the duty of unregenerate men, to labour to <HI>be holy in all manner of cover&s;ation,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet</HI> i. 15. <HI>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious &s;eed, &s;hall</HI> doubt|le&s;s <HI>come again with rejoicing, P&s;.</HI> cxxvi. 6. And tho' it would be needle&s;s to tell all that unregenerate men might do, as a proper endeavour to obtain regenerating grace; yet it is proper to add; they ought by all means
<PB N="52" REF="008874_0054_10309437C8B33BE0">to take care, that they do not re&s;t in their moral virtues, or reformations of life: They ought to con&s;ider that this doctrinal faith, and covenant &s;tate, and reformation of life, can't ju&s;tify them; therefore they ought to labour to obtain a deep and ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their unju&s;tified, and peri&s;hing condition by nature, and their inability to help them&s;elves out of that condition; or to change and renew their own hearts: Hence, in &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s, and of a peri&s;hing unju&s;tified condition; they are to cry mightily to God; to make them fully acquainted with their lo&s;t condition, and lead them to <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and enable them to receive him, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, by a living act of faith, for their eternal ju&s;tification, and peace with God.</P>
<P>Now though hone&s;t and &s;incere &s;eeking, in all the above &s;aid ways, are the proper endeavours of unregene|rate men; and tho&s;e to which regenerating grace is <HI>re|motely</HI> promi&s;ed; yet they are not the <HI>direct;</HI> but the direct endeavour, is the &s;oul's crying under a deep, and ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of an unju&s;tified &s;tate; pre&s;&s;ed down with a heavy burden of guilt; owning he de&s;erves no mercy at the hands of a holy God; yet pleading for mercy, for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and mercy's &s;ake. This endeavour is never com|pletely fini&s;hed, as the condition of regeneration, until regeneration be given; but when it is given, it is given as a thing promi&s;ed in covenant, to a groaning pri&s;oner, appointed to death.</P>
<P>Now as we have found the proper and direct endea|vour of an unregenerate man; the which I think no rea|&s;onable man can deny to be &s;uch: I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, that God hath bound him&s;elf to give regenerating grace to &s;uch men by promi&s;e, in the covenant of grace.</P>
<P>Here then I &s;hall &s;ay, as there can be but two cove|nants, namely, one of works, and the other of grace: So there can be but two ways of &s;aving in either covenant; <HI>i. e.</HI> conditionally, or unconditionally; and a covenant, called a covenant of &s;alvation, mu&s;t cea&s;e to be &s;uch; if &s;alvation is not promi&s;ed, one of the&s;e ways. Covenants are always &s;olemn, binding things when ratified. Take
<PB N="53" REF="008874_0055_1030943E354DE3A8">away bonds and obligations, and where can a covenant be found? And if men's covenants are &s;olemn, becau&s;e of their binding obligations; how much more &s;acred, and &s;olemn, mu&s;t the covenant tran&s;actions of Jehovah be? If the &s;olemn covenant of grace is not a &s;acred repo&s;itory, of inviolably &s;tipulated terms; where is the foundation for &s;acred tru&s;t? Here then, as I have inviolably proved the covenant of grace was made in the favour of all the human race; and that all that adhered to the go&s;pel covenant, and ratified it as &s;uch, were of the <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> above; and like <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> children of promi&s;e; for that they &s;tood by faith in the covenant of grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 20. <HI>Thou &s;tande&s;t by faith.</HI> So they were under the &s;acred inviolable tran&s;actions of &s;tipulation, and re&s;tipula|tion; and as I have &s;hewn, the promi&s;e mu&s;t apprehend them, where faith and the covenant fir&s;t find them; otherwi&s;e the covenant and faith would reach farther than the promi&s;e; whereas the promi&s;e is always made to the church, when faith is their qualification. Here then, as there mu&s;t be life and &s;alvation in the covenant of grace, for all that are in it, as we have before &s;een; and as that life can be covenanted for but one of the&s;e two ways, viz. conditionally, or unconditionally; &s;o in one of the&s;e ways, &s;alvation mu&s;t be certain; and what can make it certain, but the bonds of a &s;acred and &s;olemn covenant? Here then to &s;ay, God is not bound to give &s;alvation neither of the&s;e ways, is to &s;ay that &s;alvation is not covenanted for in that covenant, in which <HI>Adam,</HI> and all the vi&s;ible church, have &s;tood by faith, before they were re|generated.</P>
<P>But in order to be better under&s;tood, I would endea|vour to bring this affair into a narrower point of light; and in order to do this, it will be proper, for a &s;hort &s;pace, to ab&s;tract &s;ome part of the argument; For while I am con&s;idering the vi&s;ible church, as adhering to the covenant of grace, and &s;tanding in it by faith, as heirs, and the only heirs of the promi&s;e of regeneration, either remotely, or directly; I &s;uppo&s;e the covenant to be con|ditional:
<PB N="54" REF="008874_0056_10309440069224E8">So al&s;o, when I con&s;ider the proper endeavour of an unregenerate man, either remotely, or directly; as entituling to the promi&s;e of regeneration; I &s;till &s;up|po&s;e the covenant to be conditional: And indeed I have proved, that the covenant of grace is conditional; yet in order to reflect light on the argument in this &s;pot, it is proper to con&s;ider what mu&s;t be the &s;tate of the affair, if the covenant was unconditional: For as I am &s;aying, a covenant is a &s;olemn, and if a religious covenant, &s;acredly &s;olemn compact, of inviolable &s;tipulated terms; &s;o it is no hard &s;aying to a&s;&s;ert, that the covenanting parties are bound to abide by the &s;acredly &s;tipulated terms of the co|venant of grace; for why? If the covenanting parties are not bound to abide by the &s;tipulated terms, it cea&s;eth to be a bond, or obligation; therefore cea&s;eth to be a cove|nant. Here then it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that if God covenanted to &s;ave peri&s;hing men unconditionally, he is bound to &s;ave them unconditionally; and as he cannot covenant to &s;ave, but either conditionally or unconditionally; if be doth not covenant to &s;ave unconditionally, if he covenant to &s;ave at all, it mu&s;t be conditionally; and then, if that condition be complied with, he is &s;till bound to &s;ave all that comply: I think the world may be challenged on this conclu&s;ion. Hence then, if God had covenanted to &s;ave unconditionally, all the race of <HI>Adam</HI> mu&s;t be &s;aved; and we have nothing to do, to limit the promi&s;e to the vi&s;ible church, or any condition to be done by any; for that &s;uppo&s;eth the covenant to be conditional. And if God covenanted (as I &s;aid) to &s;ave unconditionally, the wilde&s;t &s;avage, or heathen in the world mu&s;t be &s;aved, as &s;oon as one of the vi&s;ible church; for I have proved, that when God made the covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> he made all his &s;eed foederally holy; and by oath and covenant, wa&s;hed away the blood of all of them; and made them his children in the new covenant; which as I proved, could mean nothing le&s;s than putting them into a <HI>&s;alvable &s;tate,</HI> or a way of &s;alvation by the new covenant. There|fore as I u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;eeing they are not all &s;aved, &s;ince
<PB N="55" REF="008874_0057_1030944201A0EE60">they are all covenanted for; facts prove they were not covenanted for, to be &s;aved unconditionally; yet as there are but two ways that they can be covenanted for, &s;eeing they are not covenanted for unconditionally, they mu&s;t be covenanted for conditionally, or they can't be made foederally holy, or their blood wa&s;hed away in any &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Here then, 1&s;t. I am reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of con|&s;idering men covenanted with conditionally; and 2d. I am under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity to con&s;ider all the human race covenanted with conditionally; for as we have &s;een when the covenant was made with the father, it made the unborn children, God's children, both with re&s;pect to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> as <HI>Gen.</HI> vi 2. and <HI>Ez.</HI> xvi. 8. Hence the &s;eed of both are God's, by the &s;acred bonds of a &s;olemn new covenant tran&s;action. 3. I am under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity (&s;ince the covenant is conditional) to con&s;ider the condition as a po&s;&s;ible condition to all the &s;eed of <HI>Adam;</HI> otherwi&s;e tyranny, and not mercy, would be in the covenant, for all that are not &s;aved; and then their blood could not be wa&s;hed away in any &s;en&s;e; which the &s;cripture declares it was; and I have fully proved under former heads.</P>
<P>Now as we have found, if God covenanted to &s;ave unconditionally, all mu&s;t be &s;aved, becau&s;e all were co|venanted for. So on the contrary, if God covenanted to &s;ave conditionally; it mu&s;t be po&s;&s;ible for them all to do that condition; becau&s;e they were covenanted with con|ditionally; and as we have &s;een, it is impo&s;&s;ible to make a covenant upon impo&s;&s;ible terms. Here then I &s;hall &s;ay, regeneration is &s;alvation; he that is regenerated, is &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; he is as &s;urely &s;aved, as he that went to heaven twice &s;eventeen hundred years &s;ince. Regeneration, ju&s;tifying faith, and ju&s;tification it &s;elf, are not one before the other, in the order of time; but only in the order of nature; therefore he that is regenerated, acts &s;aving faith, and is ju&s;tified at one and the &s;ame in|dividual time. Now, as regeneration is &s;alvation: when God covenanted with <HI>Adam,</HI> and made all his &s;eed foede|rally
<PB N="56" REF="008874_0058_10309444D667E6A0">holy, made them his own &s;ons and daughters, and wa&s;hed away the blood of them all, and made all that he had theirs, <HI>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. Luke</HI> xv 31. This of regeneration, mu&s;t have been covenanted for, with re&s;pect to every individual &s;on and daughter of <HI>Adam:</HI> This is but the native re&s;ult, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, of the &s;everal things I have before inviolably proved. Hence then, as regeneration is the beginning of heaven, and as a covenant that talks of &s;alvation mu&s;t be a counterfeit; but can't be the co|venant of grace, that hath not this &s;alvation &s;tipulated in it: So regeneration mu&s;t be covenanted for conditionally, or unconditionally, with re&s;pect to all the race of <HI>Adam,</HI> for that they well all parties concerned, as we have abun|dantly &s;een. Now if regeneration had been covenanted for unconditionally, the &s;acred and &s;olemn tran&s;action, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have inferr'd the &s;ure &s;alvation of all the &s;eed of <HI>Adam:</HI> And &s;eeing they are not &s;aved, we are &s;ure God covenanted with them conditionally: And we are as &s;ure, from all the nature and force of covenant ob|ligations, that when that condition is complied with, God hath bound him&s;elf by a mo&s;t gracious and &s;olemn promi&s;e, to be&s;tow that mo&s;t valuable, and nece&s;&s;ary grace of &s;alvation, <HI>regeneration.</HI> And &s;eeing this grace cannot be promi&s;ed, to any condition done by it&s;elf; it mu&s;t be promi&s;ed to the condition of an unregenerate man; and what can be more rea&s;onable, than for God to promi&s;e regenerating grace, to &s;uch proper endeavour as above de&s;cribed. Now as this conclu&s;ion is &s;o native and nece&s;&s;ary from the premi&s;es, which have been all &s;o fully proved; I think it &s;uperfluous to produce more evidence at pre&s;ent; and &s;hall only proceed to an&s;wer objections.</P>

<P>An&s;wer. If it is &s;o, it is not the fir&s;t, nor yet the &s;e|cond time, that God hath bound him&s;elf, and left the creature free; and if God make a covenant with crea|tures, as probationers, ten thou&s;and times, it will always

<P N="1">1. Query. <HI>Was not Paul regenerated by &s;overeign grace?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> No. He was called to adhere to the gospel covenant, by &s;overeign grace, becau&s;e he had adhered to a law covenant, and had been as dexterous a &s;tickler to man's own righteou&s;ne&s;s, as any &s;on of <HI>Agar,</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> below, or of the fle&s;h among them all: Therefore in that circum&s;tance he was not a &s;on of promi&s;e, any more than heathen <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But when he is by &s;overeign grace, called to adhere to the go&s;pel covenant, then he &s;eeks by faith, prays and fa&s;ts, and receiveth regeneration, as promi&s;ed to the proper endeavour of an unregenerated man.

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I do not under&s;tand, that the &s;cripture &s;up|po&s;eth any room for boa&s;ting, but when &s;alvation is of the merit of works. Now what is there in the proper en|deavour of an unregenerate man, that makes it meritori|ous? Doth the meritoriou&s;ne&s;s of it ari&s;e from the work it&s;elf, or from the &s;anction given it by the connection of the promi&s;e? If the work in it&s;elf is meritorious, then tho&s;e that oppo&s;e me in this &s;pot, are as guilty of giving room for boa&s;ting as my&s;elf: For they all &s;ay, a man mu&s;t be powerfully affected with the &s;en&s;e of an unju&s;tified &s;tate; pre&s;&s;ed down with a heavy burden of guilt; own he de|&s;erves no mercy at the hands of a holy God; yet plead for mercy, for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s and mercy's &s;ake, in order to be regenerated. I &s;uppo&s;e no per&s;on will &s;ay, this work con&s;idered in it&s;elf, can give room for boa&s;ting; and if room for boa&s;ting ari&s;eth only from the connection of the promi&s;e, then the work of ju&s;tifying faith, will al&s;o give

Here let it be ob&s;erved, that room for boa&s;ting don't ari&s;e from the different degree, or kind of influence, by which a man acts, but from the exact conformity of the action, to the divine law. <HI>e. g.</HI> Suppo&s;e &s;ome of the angels to have continued perfect by an irre&s;i&s;tible influence, and others only by a common influence of probationers, yet they would have equally de&s;erved heaven: So the acting of a ju&s;tifying faith, doth not exclude boa&s;ting, becau&s;e it is done by irre&s;i&s;tible influence (for if the work done, was &s;ufficient for his ju&s;tification, for he would be ju&s;tified on the account of it, tho' it be done by &s;uch influence) but becau&s;e it is the &s;oul's acting on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which is &s;ufficient; and therefore he cannot boa&s;t, becau&s;e his own work was no cau&s;e, why he was ju&s;tified. And &s;uppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e were able to act the &s;ame faith by a common influence, by which he might do, or not do it; yet if he doth act on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone for ju&s;tification, he will be neverthele&s;s ju&s;tified; and have no room to boa&s;t. So that it is not the power by which the &s;oul acts, let it be more or le&s;s, but the cir|cum&s;tance that attends the action, that excludes boa&s;ting. I dare be bold to &s;ay, that if a man by his own natural ability, could act the &s;ame individual act of faith, that a regenerate man doth, by the mighty power of God, he would be equally ju&s;tified, and have no room to boa&s;t, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of boa&s;ting: For faith doth not ex|clude boa&s;ting, becau&s;e it was wrought by the mighty power of God; but becau&s;e it excludes our own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; and applies the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for the matter of our ju&s;tification. And this exactly agrees with <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 27, 28, <HI>Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds of the law.</HI> Now to &s;uppo&s;e that the law of faith excludes boa&s;ting, becau&s;e it is wrought by the mighty power of God's &s;pirit; is to &s;uppo&s;e, that it
<PB N="60" REF="008874_0062_1030944F802D3A20">is not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, that excludes boa&s;ting; but &s;ome &s;anction in the act of believing, as a work that excludes boa&s;ting. But &s;urely the action, nor the &s;anction of it, as a work, are the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> and the act of faith hath no other &s;anction to exclude boa&s;ting, but the bare acting on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> And to &s;uppo&s;e, that any &s;anction in the act|ing of faith, ari&s;eth from the excellency of the influence, by which the work is done; and for that rea&s;on excludes boa&s;ting; is to &s;uppo&s;e, that to be ju&s;tified by a go&s;pel law of works, will exclude boa&s;ting: But the text is this; we are ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds of any law what&s;oever, as a work. And to the &s;ame purpo&s;e is <HI>Eph.</HI> ii 9. <HI>not of works&punc; le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Here then we &s;ee, boa&s;ting is not excluded in the act|ing of faith, from any excellency in the influence by which it is acted: why then &s;hould the faith of an unregenerate man, by a promi&s;e being connected with it, give room to boa&s;t more than the other? they are both called faith in &s;cripture; the vi&s;ible go&s;pel church, is &s;aid to &s;tand by faith, in the go&s;pel covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 20. and the regenerate are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by faith; and the apo&s;tle faith, <HI>that which is of faith, is of grace, Rom.</HI> iv. 16. <HI>therefore it is of faith, that if might be of grace.</HI> Surely that which is of grace, doth not admit of boa&s;ting.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider more di&s;tinctly, the&s;e two kinds of faith, in compari&s;on. The faith of an unregenerate man, with which the promi&s;e of regeneration is directly con|nected, is this, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. he believes that God is an infi|nitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, powerful, and &s;in revenging God, and is humbled, and deeply wounded and affected, with the view of the eternity, and inviolable excellency of the&s;e perfections. The faith of him that is regenerated, is the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He believes, that God has made a new covenant, and has &s;ent his own &s;on to die the mo&s;t &s;hameful, pain|ful, and ignominious death; to &s;ave peri&s;hing &s;inners: Hence he believes God is merciful and gracious. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the other.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="61" REF="008874_0063_10309452638E5350">
3. He believes that he is by nature, a hard, and &s;tony hearted, ju&s;tly condemned, and peri&s;hing &s;inner. So doth the other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He believes that he hath no power to change his own heart. So the other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He believes if he peri&s;h forever, he can never do any thing to de&s;erve the help of God's &s;pirit, or his ju&s;ti|fication. So doth the other.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Here then he gives up hopes of &s;alvation by law; and pleads in agonies and pains for a new heart, and for light and &s;trength, to lay hold of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he may be reconciled to God; and all is done in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s name. This of giving up life by the law, belongs to con|viction; belongs to the proper endeavour of an unre|generate man. The fir&s;t act of &s;aving faith, is venturing alone on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and it is impo&s;&s;ible to venture on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, while any hopes are left by the law. Here then we may &s;ee the harmony between the faith of the regenerate and unrege|nerate. One gives up life by the law; and &s;o doth the other. One pleads <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s righteou&s;ne&s;s alone; &s;o doth the other. The faith of one is wrought by the &s;pirit of God; and &s;o is the other. One hath lo&s;t all room for boa&s;ting; and the other al&s;o. But herein their faith dif|fers: One ventures his eternal all on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the &s;ure word of faith; the other hath not light and &s;trength to do &s;o. Therefore, the faith of the regenerate man, produceth mourning and rejoicing; and the faith of the other, mourning and lamentation. Now what is the &s;um of all, but only this? <HI>viz.</HI> That the faith of the unregenerate man, is as real faith as the other; for as he mu&s;t quit all dependence on the law, before he can be regenerated; when he hath &s;o done, if he &s;eeks at all, it mu&s;t be by faith. To &s;eek &s;alvation by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, is as true faith, as to believe alone on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for ju&s;tification; tho' one ju&s;tifieth, and the other doth not. And he that quits dependence on the law, and &s;eeks by faith alone, can by no means boa&s;t, though regenerating
<PB N="62" REF="008874_0064_10309457AB05EA80">grace be promi&s;ed to &s;uch a &s;eeker. It is this &s;eeking by faith the apo&s;tle refers to, when he &s;aith, <HI>I&s;rael did not attain righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith,</HI> Rom. ix. 31, 32. Here we &s;ee, &s;eeking by faith, is made a condition of obtaining; and if I cannot &s;eek by faith, before I obtain regeneration, I cannot &s;eek righte|ou&s;ne&s;s by faith, until I have got it; for he that is rege|nerated, hath attained righteou&s;ne&s;s. There are but two ways of &s;eeking. <HI>viz.</HI> by the law, and by faith. The <HI>Jews</HI> were unregenerate, and if &s;uch cannot &s;eek by faith, they mu&s;t &s;eek exactly as they did; and why are they blamed? Why did not God regenerate them, before he required them to &s;eek at all?</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly by boa&s;ting, you mean this, <HI>viz.</HI> that one man can &s;ay to another, if you had done as I have done; you would have been &s;aved as well as I. To which I an&s;wer, if this is your meaning, it is not the &s;cripture meaning at all, in re&s;pect of boa&s;ting. As I proved before; the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was promi&s;ed to <HI>Abrabam,</HI> and his &s;eed, by free grace; and by them was to be ob|tained by faith, as really as &s;alvation is promi&s;ed by grace; and to be obtained by faith. Now, could not tho&s;e that went into the land, have &s;aid to tho&s;e that did not; if you had done, as I have done, you might have gone in, as well as I. Did tho&s;e that went in, go by the faith of regeneration, or irre&s;i&s;tible grace? And could not tho&s;e that rebelled again&s;t God, and &s;o peri&s;hed in the wilder|ne&s;s; have done otherwi&s;e? Could tho&s;e therefore that went in, boa&s;t? If this you talk of, is the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of boa&s;ting, they could.

<PB N="65" REF="008874_0067_10309460A7083FA0">ju&s;tifying faith in the order of time, then effectual calling is improperly u&s;ed; for it is u&s;ed to &s;ignify a call to con|ver&s;ion, and not conver&s;ion it&s;elf.

Now, that effectual calling, which is prior to faith, in the order of time, (call it regeneration, or what you will) cannot &s;o conform the mind to God: And then the above-&s;aid divine principle, which cannot exi&s;t, in the order of time, prior to ju&s;tifying faith, wants a name, if regeneration is not the name of it.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall critici&s;e no longer, on other men's &s;enti|ments; but proceed to communicate my own; both on effectual calling, and regeneration.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As to an irre&s;i&s;tible call, before ju&s;tifying faith; there is no &s;uch thing. This will appear from &s;everal rea&s;ons: 1. An irre&s;i&s;tible call confirms a man (as was &s;aid before) in a &s;tate of &s;alvation; therefore it a&s;&s;umes the prerogative of ju&s;tifying faith; and no man hath power to become a &s;on of God, in a confirmed &s;en&s;e, without receiving <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by a ju&s;tifying faith, <HI>John</HI> i. 12: tho' a man have all faith, &s;o that he could remove moun|tains, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 2. yet if it doth not conform the mind to God, in pure love, to God and holine&s;s; he is nothing in a confirmed &s;en&s;e: If men ta&s;te the heavenly gift; and partake the holy gho&s;t; ta&s;te the powers of the

<P N="2">2. The conclu&s;ion, that conviction is irre&s;i&s;tible, is drawn from no premi&s;es that infer it. The premi&s;es are 1. &s;cripture, 2. experience. The <HI>&s;criptures</HI> from which &s;uch conclu&s;ion is inferred, are &s;uch as <HI>P&s;.</HI> cx. 3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> vi 44. <HI>No man can come to me, except the father draw him.</HI> But both the&s;e texts re&s;pect regeneration; and not conviction; for it is the real coming to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by a ju&s;ti|fying act of faith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that can be here intended; and who denies a day of mighty power, being nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch coming? unle&s;s it be &s;uch as deny the mighty power of God being nece&s;&s;ary to regeneration. 2. The <HI>experience,</HI> from which &s;uch a conclu&s;ion is drawn, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> men that are regenerated, are fir&s;t powerfully convicted; they are in great di&s;tre&s;s; and continue earne&s;t &s;eekers, until they obtain regeneration; while many others, that &s;eem to be as powerfully convicted as they, turn back and peri&s;h. Hence it is concluded, that &s;uch as continue &s;eeking till they find, are under an irre&s;i&s;tible &s;overeign influence; but the conclu&s;ion will be as well inferred, that the angels who continued perfect, were under an irre&s;i&s;t|ible influence; which is to de&s;troy the notion of their be|ing created probationers. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e that did turn back, were once earne&s;t &s;eekers; and who dare &s;ay, they could not continue &s;uch? A re&s;i&s;tible power made them &s;uch (is allowed) and to &s;ay a re&s;i&s;tible power could not continue them &s;uch, is a &s;elf contradiction. And if they had continued &s;eeking, why &s;hould they not find? Men mu&s;t follow on to know the Lord, if they would be &s;uc|ce&s;sful, <HI>Ho&s;</HI> vi. 3. and that we may &s;ee they can do, without irre&s;i&s;tible conviction; therefore (as I &s;aid) the conclu&s;ion is drawn from no premi&s;es that inferred &s;uch conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to regeneration; it is nothing el&s;e but the power, and principle of ju&s;tifying faith; it is that power by which the &s;oul is renewed. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 2. &s;o that it is transformed,

Faith cannot act, until it exi&s;t; and regeneration is the power of its exi&s;tence. Regeneration, as it &s;ignifies renewing, transforming, and conforming the &s;oul to God, to eternal acceptance, doth none of the&s;e things prior to, or ab&s;tract from a ju&s;tifying faith. It is therefore, only the principle of faith; but it is faith that conforms the &s;oul, purifies the heart, and works pure love to God and holi|ne&s;s. And as there can be no &s;uch conformity, prior to the acting of faith; &s;o there can be no regeneration, prior to faith, in the order of time. But</P>
<P>I &s;hall now enquire, whether convicting and converting graces, are of different kinds; or regeneration, only a greater degree of the &s;ame kinds; and I am of opinion, the latter is the truth. And here I &s;hall &s;ay, it is dark|ne&s;s in the under&s;tanding, ignorance and blindne&s;s of heart, that alienates the &s;oul from God, <HI>Eph</HI> iv. 18 and by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, the re&s;toring of &s;piritual light in the under&s;tanding, mu&s;t reduce the &s;oul to its original bias, and primitive &s;ua&s;ion; in proportion to the degree of that light. Wherein did man's original &s;piritual death (which was the death of all deaths) con&s;i&s;t, but in the privation of &s;piritual light, in the rea&s;onable &s;oul? God veils his glorious perfections and attributes; as to their beauty and amiablene&s;s, harmony, and con&s;i&s;tency; and leaves the rational &s;oul, de&s;titute of a divine impre&s;s. Hence the once elevated mind, is bereaved of its original happy bia&s;s, and &s;weet &s;ua&s;ion; God's moral image, with which it was impre&s;t, becomes extinct; and the de&s;olate &s;oul commenceth bankrupt. Now all that is nece&s;&s;ary, to the re&s;toring the &s;oul to its primitive glory, beauty, and original &s;weet &s;ua&s;ion; is the unveiling the divine
<PB N="68" REF="008874_0070_103095CF4ED81450">perfections; and re-impre&s;&s;ing the human &s;oul with their beauty, amiablene&s;s and charms. This will melt the harde&s;t heart; and make the mo&s;t &s;tubborn &s;inner bow. The &s;oul is the ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t to all the religious and regular de|corum of the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and rea&s;on is the agent of all the moral and eva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">cal conformity, of all the powers, pa&s;&s;ions, and faculties of the human &s;oul to God. The &s;pirit of God can make no religious impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;oul, but in the eye of rea&s;on; to &s;uppo&s;e the will is bowed, any other way, than by an impre&s;&s;ion made on the under|&s;tanding; is to &s;uppo&s;e, a brute creature might be made religious; and is &s;uch a mechanical notion of religion, as I de&s;ire not to be concerned with; for that it makes man a machine: Now what is &s;piritual conviction, but an im|pre&s;&s;ion of God's perfections on the &s;oul; by a degree of illumination? tho&s;e &s;o enlightened, are <HI>made partakers of the holy gho&s;t,</HI> Heb. vi 4. The &s;ame &s;pirit, that con|vinceth of righteou&s;ne&s;s, convinceth al&s;o of &s;in, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 8. In conviction, the &s;oul is carried from one degree of illumination to another; convinced fir&s;t of one thing, then of another; until it is fully prepared, to be enlightened with the ability and willingne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ave; the freedom and &s;atisfaction that God the father hath, in &s;av|ing a peri&s;hing &s;oul by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;on. And what is it can make the guilty di&s;couraged &s;oul, venture its eternal all on the faithful word of truth, and promi&s;e of God, but only being fairly enlightened about it? All the light that a convicted &s;oul obtains, though it create great anxiety to be &s;aved, yet cannot regenerate the heart, until it ari&s;e to &s;uch a degree of clearne&s;s, as to enable the &s;oul to venture; and whenever it ari&s;eth to &s;uch degree, there is no &s;pace of time between that and the &s;oul's venturing. And hence the &s;oul is regenerated by that faith, which is only produced by a greater degree of light. There was faith before, that created many changes in the mind; but this only can conform the heart to God; for while the &s;oul refu&s;eth to venture on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, it can never be impre&s;&s;ed with the beauty, amiable|ne&s;s,
<PB N="69" REF="008874_0071_103095D0F500E4B8">and con&s;i&s;tency of the divine perfections: All God's ways till then, are not ways of plea&s;antne&s;s; therefore the mind cannot be conformed or regenerated. Hence it is &s;aid, <HI>God who commanded the light to &s;hine out darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the know|leage of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor iv 6 And <HI>we all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image,</HI> chap. iii. 18.</P>
<P>If all that is meant by regeneration being a different kind of grace, to that of conviction, is only this, <HI>viz.</HI> that different graces, di&s;po&s;itions, pa&s;&s;ions, and affections, are wrought in us; that is to teach the world nothing; for every one may &s;ee that: But how doth the&s;e different graces in us, prove the grace of conviction and conver|&s;ion are of different kinds? A greater degree of light of the &s;ame kind, can make as great a difference as this. What va&s;t degree of difference is made, in the pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;po&s;ition, and affections of men, under high or low convictions; are they therefore different graces of the &s;pirit? And what is conver&s;ion, but acting by a high degree of conviction, about what is right or wrong. We know the rays of the &s;un in direct lines, make va&s;tly dif|ferent impre&s;&s;ions on all globical &s;ub&s;tances, to tho&s;e that are in indirect, oblique, and circular lines. Tho&s;e in direct lines, make it always &s;ummer at the equinoctial; tho&s;e in oblique, make it &s;ometimes winter, &s;ometimes &s;ummer here, <HI>i. e.</HI> hot or cold. It is not the greater di&s;tance of the &s;un from us, that is the cau&s;e of the ex|treme cold in our northern climes in winter; but the more oblique manner of the rays &s;triking on the earth, to that of &s;ummer. Were the &s;un at twice the di&s;tance at the equator, it would be hotter there than here, at the com|mon di&s;tance; becau&s;e of the &s;traight direction of the lines: or the lines &s;triking in a direct manner, occa&s;ion a direct reflection; while tho&s;e in an oblique, only glance. And how va&s;tly different are the impre&s;&s;ions of light on us, that are from the &s;un in direct rays, to tho&s;e that are
<PB N="70" REF="008874_0072_103095D29F52EBC0">indirect and circular: Such as before the &s;un makes its appearance in our horizon, after day break; or at &s;econd|hand from the moon. Tho&s;e rays in direct lines from the &s;un, communicate heat as well as light, and con|junctly con&s;pire to promote every u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s; and in&s;pire the creation for vigorous action; while tho&s;e from the moon, leave the creation chill'd or congeal'd dull, &s;tupid, and inactive. And are all the&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions, affections, and di&s;po&s;itions, occa&s;ioned by a different kind of light? No &s;urely! but only from a greater or le&s;&s;er degree of the &s;ame kind Now the convictions that are prior to regeneration, are more circular, oblique, and indirect: They are by the law mainly; which is as a two|edged &s;word that cuts every way; but cannot cure. There is light, but no perceptible heat, like rays of the moon. But then, as the <HI>law is in the hand of a mediator,</HI> Gal. iii. 19. It is the <HI>&s;word that goes from Chri&s;t's mouth,</HI> Rev. i. 16. and the convictions create<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by it, are the &s;triving of God's &s;pirit, in the go&s;pel covenant. Hence they are like the day &s;tar ari&s;ing in the heart: and the day &s;pring from an high vi&s;iting. They forebode the ri&s;ing of the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Mal.</HI> iv 2. <HI>Luke</HI> i. 78. 2 <HI>Pet</HI> i. 19. But when the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;eth, in di&s;plays of rich grace, and go&s;pel love; the &s;tony heart di&s;&s;olves; the affections are fired with primitive beauty; and the anxious and perplexed &s;oul is charmed to re&s;t. And yet all this is but the native re&s;ult of greater light of the &s;ame kind. And what is it that renders the church triumphantly perfect? (not a different kind of grace) but greater degrees of the &s;ame kind. Now we &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly; but then face to face. When he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him: for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii 12. 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 2. and yet how much more graceful are the&s;e heavenly fires, than we?</P>
<P>I conceive this notion of regeneration, being a different kind of grace to that of conviction, has been the cau&s;e of much confu&s;ion in the chri&s;tian world; and po&s;&s;ibly <HI>hath &s;lain its ten thou&s;ands:</HI> For by means of this, men look
<PB N="71" REF="008874_0073_103095D57954B648">upon regeneration to be &s;ome kind of unknown, unintel|ligible thing; and conclude they can do nothing towards believing in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or changing their own hearts, until they obtain that grace of the &s;pirit: Hence they wait for it, and expect &s;ome kind of unknown power mu&s;t fall from heaven, much like the miraculous falling of the holy gho&s;t on the day of Penteco&s;t&punc; <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 2, 3. And when people of this notion are converted as they &s;uppo&s;e, they love to &s;peak of wonders, of vi&s;ions, or of voices, or of the immediate application of a text; as though the word of faith was not &s;ufficient to be believed, without a new revelation of it: And though many of tho&s;e who hold regeneration is a different kind of grace to that of conviction, don't approve of the&s;e extraordinary conver|&s;ions; yet they take their ri&s;e from their own extraordi|nary notion of regeneration. Hence al&s;o it is, that men are &s;o much urg'd to wait for the &s;pirit; and it is &s;up|po&s;ed, both by preacher and hearer, it would be pre|&s;umption to attempt to believe in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by a ju&s;tifying faith, until they have obtained the grace of regeneration; which is a different kind of grace, to any that an unrege|nerate man has, as they &s;uppo&s;e. Here I &s;hall particula|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e a number of the evils this fal&s;e notion of regeneration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth, both to &s;aints and &s;inners.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sinners often lo&s;e a very promi&s;ing conviction by it; they wait for the &s;pirit of regeneration, until their convic|tions die, and dwindle to nothing.</P>
<P N="2">2. They conceive hard thoughts of God, as tho' he was not willing to &s;ave, becau&s;e he won't regenerate them in the way they are waiting for it&punc;</P>

The&s;e things they dare not attempt to do; becau&s;e they have not the &s;pirit of regeneration (as they &s;uppo&s;e) hence they mu&s;t pray, and wait: This kind of waiting is much like a youth that would learn arithmetic by neglecting the &s;tudy of his rules, waiting for the ma&s;ter to teach him: The

<P N="3">3. This notion, that conviction and regeneration are dif|ferent kinds of grace, holds the church in con&s;tant &s;elf con|tradiction and confu&s;ion.

Saying the promi&s;e of regeneration is made to the elect; and then &s;aying no unregenerate man is drawn by the mighty power of God, otherwi&s;e he would be an heir of promi&s;e; and yet &s;aying they are drawn by irre&s;i&s;tible conviction; and yet not heirs of pro|mi&s;e.

<P>But now let us turn the affair and &s;ay, convicting and regenerating graces are of one kind, and differ only in degree, and there is no need to &s;ay and un&s;ay: For why?

Many things might be &s;aid touching the DECREES; many have been the controver&s;ies about them; I believe there have been many injurious thoughts on all &s;ides; but my de&s;ign is not to concern my&s;elf any farther with other men's thoughts, than as they may lie as objections to my own; and &s;hall proceed to communicate my own freely.</P>
<P>Here then I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething concerning the nature, cau&s;e and manner of God's decrees: for though we are not able to comprehend all the coun&s;els of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or &s;ee into the rea&s;ons of all his determinations and conduct; yet according as rea&s;on and revelation hath furni&s;hed us, we may &s;peak with &s;afety.</P>
<P N="1">1. With re&s;pect to the nature of a decree of God; it is the &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed determination of the unchangeable God, who is the &s;upreme agent that <HI>doth all things after the coun&s;el of his own will,</HI> Eph i 11.

And his hand is &s;tretched out, and who &s;hall turn it back?</HI> I&s;a. xiv. 14, 27</P>
<P N="2">2. The cau&s;e of decrees is this, <HI>viz</HI> God who &s;ees all things from eternity to eternity that are, &s;hall be, or po&s;&s;i|bly can be, by one infinite view of his all comprehen&s;ible wi&s;dom and knowledge, cannot be an idle &s;pectator.

Our rational minds furni&s;h us with the&s;e dictates, <HI>viz.</HI> That if we could &s;ee all that will be done in the next century, or age of the world, had it in our own power to cau&s;e, or prevent; if we had wi&s;dom &s;ufficient at pre&s;ent, to be ab&s;olutely determined which would be be&s;t; we could do no le&s;s at pre&s;ent, than decree either to cau&s;e, permit, prevent,

<P N="3">3. The manner in which God decrees things is this.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they have no influence, either on his own, or any creature's conduct. God's decrees are only indications, or expre&s;&s;ions of the certainty of events; but no cau&s;e either of the events them&s;elves, or of their certainty. This conclu&s;ion will appear inviolable in all; <HI>e. g.</HI> God from eternity decreed to create the world, but doth that decree influence God? <HI>i. e.</HI> doth God create the world be|cau&s;e he hath bound him&s;elf by a decree to create it? Why did he decree to do it? he &s;urely &s;aw &s;ome &s;ufficient rea&s;on, or he would never decree it: And that rea&s;on which is &s;ufficient to di&s;po&s;e God to decree it, mu&s;t be the rea&s;on of the certainty why he will do it; to found the rea&s;on of God's creating on one thing, and the certainty on another, is to &s;uppo&s;e that when God &s;aw &s;ufficient rea&s;on to create the world, it was not certain that he will do it, until he hath bound him&s;elf by a decree, <HI>i. e.</HI> that rea&s;on which infinite wi&s;dom &s;aw &s;ufficient for the creating the world, is not &s;ufficient to di&s;po&s;e God certainly to do it; therefore le&s;t he &s;hould neglect doing that which he &s;ees &s;ufficient rea&s;on for, he decrees he will do it, and that makes it certain he will do it. Surely when God &s;aw &s;ufficient rea&s;on, to di&s;po&s;e him to decree the creation of the world; that &s;ame rea&s;on was &s;ufficient, to di&s;po&s;e him certainly to do it; therefore the decree has no influence in the creating, or the certainty of it. If it is objected, God could not &s;ee the creation as a certainty prior to the decree? It is an&s;wered, God &s;aw &s;ufficient rea&s;on for crea|ting, prior to the decree; and if God &s;aw &s;ufficient rea&s;on for creating, prior to the decree; that rea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;uffici|ent to di&s;po&s;e him certainly to create; and God's &s;eeing the creation a certainty, is not the re&s;ult of the decree, but the re&s;ult of infinite wi&s;dom, &s;eeing &s;ufficient rea&s;on for creating; and God &s;eeing &s;ufficient rea&s;on to di&s;po&s;e him certainly to create, is the rea&s;on why he decrees cer|tainly to do it.</P>

Indeed there were many things wonderful in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> his per&s;on, name, coun&s;els, and miraculous conduct, compo&s;e a mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;cene of wonders: But then his wonderfulne&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in incon&s;i&s;tency, and injudiciou&s;ne&s;s; and who under heaven can tell, what end he could propo&s;e, in telling God's covenant people, they were reprobates; for whom there was no provi&s;ion made in the covenant of grace; and that he had nothing to do with them, for they were not his &s;heep, and he was not &s;ent to be their &s;hepherd: And then cry <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, how often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye would not.</HI> i. e. How often would I have gathered reprobates, when I had no commi&s;&s;ion to do &s;o. And then behold the city, and weep over it, &s;aying, <HI>if thou had&s;t known in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace;</HI> when they neither had a day of grace; or any thing belonging to their peace; and it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould know they had. But &s;urely every man of &s;en&s;e mu&s;t &s;ay, if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had once told them they were reprobates, and he had no commi&s;&s;ion to be their &s;hep|herd, for they were not of his &s;heep; he could not con|&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, ever after &s;uch declaration, urge the&s;e reprobates, to believe on him for &s;alvation. But this he doth with the mo&s;t powerful arguments (con&s;i&s;t|ent or incon&s;i&s;tent) <HI>John</HI> x. 37, 38, <HI>If I do not the works of my father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye be|lieve not me, believe the works: That ye may know and believe that the father is in me, and I in him.</HI> Hence then we mu&s;t look for &s;ome other di&s;tinction of &s;heep, then either being regenerate, or of the elect, or barely being the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and &s;o God's covenant people. And the true di&s;tinction, is that which is made <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. and <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. Such as turn the go&s;pel covenant into a law covenant, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> cannot be their &s;hepherd, nor they his &s;heep, be they of the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham</HI> as they will; they are children of the bond-woman, and not of

And here we &s;ee, how &s;orrowfully this text, for many ages, has been rack'd and tortured, to make it &s;peak a &s;en&s;e, that makes <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s conduct non|&s;en&s;e. And &s;till we &s;ee, decrees have no influence, and do no way embarras the covenant of grace; though the number of elect and reprobate, are certain and definite; any more than the decrees of God, with re&s;pect to angels, embarra&s;&s;ed their convenant &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">3. I was to &s;hew, <HI>that efficacious grace is nece&s;&s;ary to regeneration, and ju&s;tification; from which none can fall.</HI></P>
<P>As to the grace of regeneration, and the efficacy of it, I have &s;ufficiently di&s;cour&s;ed, under the 7th heard upon the covenant; therefore I &s;hall proceed to &s;ay &s;omething of the per&s;everance of the &s;aints. And the rea&s;on why the &s;aints cannot fall from grace, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> a ju&s;tifying faith in&s;ures all that have it, in a &s;tate of &s;alvation. He that is ju&s;tified, &s;hall not come into condemnation; he hath everla&s;ting life, and is pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, John v. 24. <HI>he that believeth on the &s;on, hath everla&s;ting life.</HI> John iii. 36. <HI>They &s;hall never peri&s;h,</HI> John x. 28. A ju&s;tifying faith, puts tho&s;e that have it, beyond a &s;tate of probation. To be on trial for any thing, &s;uppo&s;eth always the thing uncertain, and not in&s;ured. The &s;aints are upon tryal for growth in grace, and increa&s;ing fitne&s;s for the heavenly world. And this growth, as to the
<PB N="92" REF="008874_0094_10309618055B71D8">greater or le&s;s degree of it, will be according as men im|prove in ordinary ca&s;es. How much knowledge a &s;aint &s;hall have in this world, is uncertain; or how great his faith, love to God and holine&s;s, to the &s;aints, his meek|ne&s;s, patience, and temperance &s;hall be, is uncertain. A degree of every grace is certain, to every &s;aint: He is therefore a probationer, only for a greater degree; but a greater ju&s;tification, a &s;aint cannot obtain, than he hath at fir&s;t; for it is perfect. God may pardon the &s;ins of the &s;aints every day; and they have need of it, <HI>for in many things they offend,</HI> James iii. 2. <HI>And there is not a a ju&s;t man upon earth, that doth good, and &s;inneth not,</HI> Eccl vii. 20. But it is one thing to pardon the &s;ins and imperfections of a &s;aint, and another to ju&s;tify his &s;tate. Men are in&s;ured in a &s;tate of &s;alvation, when ever they come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t. Adam</HI>'s righteou&s;ne&s;s would have in&s;ured all his po&s;terity, if he had continued perfect, whenever they became heirs of it, and that would have been by natural generation. Men are made heirs of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the faith of regeneration. And tho' <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;eed would have been bound to be holy, yet not as probationers; for they would have been in&s;ured. So the &s;aints are under the highe&s;t obligations to be <HI>holy in all manner of conver&s;ation and godline&s;s,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 11. But then, they are not probationers to obtain a right and title to the eternal in|heritance of heaven, for that is made &s;ure on the acting of the faith of ju&s;tification; and this is the only rea&s;on why a &s;aint cannot fall from grace. <HI>Satan may de&s;ire to have them, and &s;ift them as wheat;</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will always <HI>pray for them, that their faith fail not,</HI> Luke xxii. 31. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> prays they <HI>may be kept from the evil of the world,</HI> John xvii. 15. and it will &s;urely be done.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and la&s;tly, I was to &s;hew, that a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ailing, is always nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;tate of probation, for regeneration, ju&s;tification, eternal life, or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="008874_0095_1030961B2D440340">
I have already con&s;idered, that &s;uch as act a ju&s;tifying faith, are at the &s;ame in&s;tant ju&s;tified, and therefore not probationers for ju&s;tification, after &s;uch act. And that regenerating grace, is before that act, in the order of nature; and al&s;o that eternal life, is nece&s;&s;arily connected with the &s;ame ju&s;tifying act of faith; &s;o that heaven with all the glory of the heavenly &s;tate, is in&s;ured, and con|firmed in the favour of &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons. And if per&s;ons are upon trial, as probationers for things, they are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and are influenced and con|firmed to them; we have lo&s;t all in the ideas of a proba|tionary &s;tate; and mu&s;t con&s;ider the angels yet as proba|tioners, for they are as much bound to their good beha|viour, as the &s;aints. Here then we &s;ee, if men are ever probationers for regeneration, ju&s;tification, or eternal life, it mu&s;t be before they act the faith of regeneration. And we al&s;o &s;ee, that all per&s;ons that &s;ay, men are not probationers in the covenant of grace, for life and happi|ne&s;s, until they act the faith of regeneration, implicitly &s;ay, they are not probationers for life and happine&s;s at all.

1. Hence then we &s;ee, if men are ever probationers for life and &s;alvation, it is before they are regenerated; for regeneration conforms the &s;oul to God, in acts of ju&s;tifying faith, and holy love; and is the beginning of heaven; and in&s;ures the full fruition of it.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4.

<P N="5">5. We hence &s;ee, if regenerating grace in&s;ures &s;alvati|on to them that have it (which I hope no thinking, un|der&s;tanding chri&s;tian will deny) then God can covenant about life and &s;alvation, with no people as probationers for it, but the unregenerate: For as we have &s;een, the regenerate cannot be probationers for it, becau&s;e they are in&s;ured in it; and a certainty of obtaining the &s;al|vation covenanted for, or an impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining it, either of them de&s;troy the notion of a probationary &s;tate.</P>
<P N="6">6. We hence &s;ee, if God makes the covenant of grace with none but the regenerate, or &s;uch as act a ju&s;tifying faith, and not until they are regenerated, or act that act; then he &s;aves none as probationers: For that act in&s;ures; and if the covenant is not made before a ju&s;tifying act of

If it be replied, <HI>faith is a condition of the covenant, and men are upon trial whe|ther they will act a ju&s;tifying act of faith, and when they will act a ju&s;tifying act of faith; and when they do it, they are &s;aved as probationers.</HI> It is an&s;wered, if the co|venant is not made with him that is &s;aved, before he act a ju&s;tifying faith; faith, which is the gift of God, was given to him before he was in covenant; and what God gives to men out of covenant, is not given to them as probationers; for they are probationers no otherwi&s;e, than as being in covenant.</P>
<P N="7">7.

Hence then, God can covenant with no per&s;on or per&s;ons, as pro|bationers for life and &s;alvation, but the unregenerate: And the&s;e cannot be probationers, if they are confirmed in &s;alvation, as being elect; or &s;ealed under a decree of pre|de&s;tination to peri&s;h, as reprobates.

It would be a piece of the grande&s;t &s;uperfluity, to produce &s;criptural evidence for this; for the word of God is full of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. We hence &s;ee the rea&s;on why God covenanted with unregenerate men, about life and &s;alvation; <HI>viz.</HI> that he de&s;igned to &s;ave men in a covenant way, and as proba|tioners; which could not be, if they were &s;aved before be covenanted with them: If the angels had been con|firmed in a &s;tate of &s;alvation before they were covenanted with, they could never have been &s;aved as probationers, or in a covenant way: The covenant mu&s;t be made be|fore that confirmation, not only in the order of nature, but al&s;o of time; for they mu&s;t have time after the cove|nant is made, to do either good or evil; for if they are not in the covenant, they cannot be probationers by it; and if they are confirmed; and can do nothing but good, neither are they probationers. So if God will &s;ave men as probationers, the covenant of grace mu&s;t be made with them, before a ju&s;tifying act of faith, not only in the order of nature, but al&s;o of time: For before they can be probationers, they mu&s;t be in covenant; and if, they are not there, before a ju&s;tifying act of faith, even in the order of time; they cannot be probationers: for an act of faith conforms the heart to God; and they cannot choo&s;e evil, &s;o as to come into condemnation; therefore, if they are not in covenant before regeneration, in the order of time; they have no time to do any thing but believe: And they never &s;aw a time, after they were in covenant, that they could do that, for which they could

<P N="11">11th, We hence &s;ee, there is no way to deny the covenant of grace, being made with unregenerate men, without denying al&s;o, that God de&s;igned to &s;ave men in a covenant way, and as probationers: And where is the man &s;o hardy as to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a thing?</P>

And who can prove to us, that the <HI>Friends</HI> (as they choo&s;e to call them&s;elves) are they and their infant offspring, in &s;aid covenant? Neither of the churches di&s;tinct from them, can receive them for members; admit them to their communion, or to &s;it at the Lord's table (if they would de&s;ire the privilege) until they are baptized: And could we po&s;&s;ibly prove God made the covenant with <HI>Adam</HI> and his &s;eed, and <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed, and &s;o prove a univer&s;al redemption, from their all being in covenant?
