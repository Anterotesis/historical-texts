<HEAD>SERMON I. ON THE <HI>CAUSES</HI> OF <HI>MEN'S</HI> BEING WEARY OF <HI>LIFE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB X. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>My &s;oul is weary of my life.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOB, in the fir&s;t part of his days, was <HI>the greate&s;t of all the men of the Ea&s;t.</HI> His po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were large, his family was numerous and flouri&s;hing; his own character was fair and blamele&s;s. Yet this man it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it with extraordinary rever|&s;es of fortune. He was robbed of his whole &s;ub|&s;tance. His &s;ons and his daughters all peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed; and he him&s;elf, fallen from his high e&s;tate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hild|le&s;s and reduced to poverty, was &s;mitten with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore di&s;ea&s;e. His friends came about him, &s;eemingly with the purpo&s;e of admini&s;tering comfort. But from a har&s;h and ill-founded con&s;truction of the in|tention of Providence in his di&s;a&s;ters, they only added to his &s;orrows by unju&s;t upbraiding. Hence tho&s;e many pathetic lamentations with which this book abounds, poured forth in the mo&s;t beautiful and touching &s;train of Oriental poetry. In one of tho&s;e hours of lamentation, the &s;entiment in the text was uttered; <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life;</HI> a
<PB N="2" REF="028306_0007_0FD894D73ADB1BB0">&s;entiment, which &s;urely, if any &s;ituation can ju&s;tify it, was allowable in the ca&s;e of Job.</P>
<P>In &s;ituations very different from that of Job, un|der calamities far le&s;s &s;evere, it is not uncommon to find &s;uch a &s;entiment working in the heart, and &s;ometimes breaking forth from the lips of men. Many, very many there are, who on one occa&s;ion or other, have experienced this wearine&s;s of life, and been tempted to wi&s;h that it would come to a clo&s;e. Let us now examine in what circum&s;tances this feeling may be deemed excu&s;able; in what it is to be held &s;inful; and under what re&s;trictions we may, on any occa&s;ion, be permitted to &s;ay, <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider the words of the text in three lights; as expre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;entiment of a di&s;contented man; <HI>Secondly,</HI> The &s;entiment of an afflicted man; <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The &s;entiment of a devout man.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let us con&s;ider the text as expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en|timent of a di&s;contented man; with whom it is the effu&s;ion of &s;pleen, vexation, and di&s;&s;atisfaction with life, ari&s;ing from cau&s;es neither laudable nor ju&s;tifi|able. There are chiefly three cla&s;&s;es of men who are liable to this di&s;ea&s;e of the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the idle; the luxurious; the criminal.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This wearine&s;s of life is often found among the idle; per&s;ons commonly in ea&s;y circum&s;tances of fortune, who are not engaged in any of the labo|rious occupations of the world, and who are, at the &s;ame time, without energy of mind to call them forth into any other line of active exertion. In this languid, or rather torpid &s;tate, they have &s;o many vacant hours, and are &s;o much at a lo&s;s how to fill up their time, that their &s;pirits utterly &s;ink; they become burden&s;ome to them&s;elves, and to every one
<PB N="3" REF="028306_0008_0FD894D97A9F3B90">around them; and drag with pain the load of exi&s;t|ence. What a convincing proof is hereby afforded, that man was de&s;igned by his Creator to be an active being, who&s;e happine&s;s is to be found not merely in re&s;t, but in occupation and pur&s;uit? The idle are doomed to &s;uffer the natural puni&s;hment of their inactivity and folly; and for their complaints of the tire&s;omene&s;s of life there is no remedy but to awake from the dream of &s;loth, and to fill up with proper employment the mi&s;erable vacancies of their days. Let them &s;tudy to become u&s;eful to the world, and they &s;hall &s;oon become le&s;s burden&s;ome to them|&s;elves. They &s;hall begin to enjoy exi&s;tence; they &s;hall reap the rewards which Providence has annexed to virtuous activity; and have no more cau&s;e to &s;ay <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> The luxurious and the di&s;&s;ipated form ano|ther cla&s;s of men, among whom &s;uch complaints are &s;till more frequent. With them they are not the fruit of idlene&s;s. The&s;e are men who have been bu&s;ied enough; they have run the whole race of plea&s;ure; but they have run it with &s;uch incon&s;ider|ate &s;peed, that it terminates in wearine&s;s and vex|ation of &s;pirit. By the perpetual cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipa|tion in which they are engaged; by the exce&s;&s;es which they indulge; by the riotous revel, and the midnight or rather morning hours to which they prolong their &s;ectivity; they have debilitated their bodies, and worn out their &s;pirits. Satiated with the repetition of their accu&s;tomed plea&s;ures, and yet unable to find any new ones in their place; wander|ing round and round their former haunts of joy, and ever returning di&s;appointed; weary of them&s;elves, and of all things about them, their &s;pirits are op|pre&s;&s;ed with a deadly gloom, and the complaint bur&s;ts forth of odious life and a mi&s;erable world. Never
<PB N="4" REF="028306_0009_0FD894DB5A7E1EA8">are the&s;e complaints more irequent than at the clo&s;e of rounds of amu&s;ement, and after a long repetition of fe&s;tal plea&s;ures; when the &s;pirits which had been forced up, as by &s;ome intoxicating drug, to an un|natural height, &s;ub&s;ide into profound dejection. What increa&s;es the evil is, that it is not among the infirm and the aged, but among the young, the gay, and the pro&s;perous, who ought to be reputed the happie&s;t men, that this di&s;ta&s;te of life mo&s;t frequent|ly prevails.</P>
<P>When per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, in their peevi&s;h and &s;plenetic hours, exclaim, <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life,</HI> let them know, let them be a&s;&s;ured, that this is no other than the judgment of God overtaking them for their vices and follies. Their complaints of mi&s;|ery are entitled to no compa&s;&s;ion; nay, they are &s;in|ful, becau&s;e they ari&s;e from a &s;inful cau&s;e; from a mind broken and deba&s;ed by luxury and corruption. They are the authors of their own mi&s;ery, by having thrown away on the follies of the world tho&s;e pow|ers which God had be&s;towed on them for nobler ends.&mdash;Let them return to the duties of men and Chri&s;tians. Let them retreat from frivolity, and ab&s;tain from exce&s;s. Let them &s;tudy temper|ance, moderation, and &s;elf-command. By enter|ing on a virtuous and manly cour&s;e of action, and applying to the honourable di&s;charge of the &s;unctions of their &s;tation, they will acquire different views. They will obtain more real enjoyment of life, and become more willing to prolong it.&mdash;But, after the warnings which God has given them of their mi&s;behaviour by the inward mi&s;ery they &s;uffer, if they &s;till continue to run the &s;ame intemperate round, and to drain plea&s;ure to the la&s;t dregs, it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that they who now contemn life, and are impatient of its continuance, &s;hall be the per&s;ons
<PB N="5" REF="028306_0010_0FD894DC81031050">mo&s;t eager to prolong it. When they behold it in reality drawing towards a clo&s;e, and are obliged to look forward to what is to come after it, they &s;hall be rendered awfully &s;en&s;ible of its value. They will then gra&s;p eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to &s;top them if they could, and to employ every mo|ment that remains in repairing their pa&s;t errors, and in making their peace, if po&s;&s;ible, with God and heaven. According as <HI>they have &s;own,</HI> they now <HI>reap.</HI> They are reduced <HI>to eat the fruit of their own ways, and to be filled with their own devices.</HI></P>
<P>There remains &s;till a third cla&s;s of tho&s;e who from di&s;content are become weary of life; &s;uch as have embittered it to them&s;elves by the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of criminal deeds. They have been, perhaps, unnatural to their parents, or treacherous to their friends; they have violated their fidelity; have en|&s;nared and ruined the innocent; or have occa&s;ioned the death of others. There is no wonder that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould lo&s;e their reli&s;h for life. To what|ever arts they may have recour&s;e for procuring a de|ceitful peace, con&s;cience will at times exert its native power, and &s;hake over them its terrific, &s;courge. The internal mi&s;ery they endure has &s;ometimes ari&s;en to &s;uch a height, as has made them terminate, with their own hands, an exi&s;tence which they felt to be in&s;upportable.&mdash;To the complaints of &s;uch per&s;ons no remedy can be furni&s;hed, except what ari|&s;es from the bitterne&s;s of &s;incere and deep repentance. We can do no more than exhort them to atone as much as is in their power for the evils they have committed; and to fly to the divine mercy through Je&s;us Chri&s;t for pardon and forgivene&s;s. Let us now,</P>
<P N="2">II. Turn to per&s;ons of another de&s;cription, and con&s;ider the &s;entiment in the text as extorted by &s;itu|ations
<PB N="6" REF="028306_0011_0FD894DE3888EA68">of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;s. The&s;e are &s;o variou&s;ly multiplied in the world, and often &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and heavy, that a&s;&s;uredly it is not uncommon to hear the afflicted complain that they are weary of life. Their com|plaints, if not always allowable, yet certainly are more excu&s;able than tho&s;e which flow from the &s;ources of di&s;&s;atisfaction already mentioned. They are &s;ufferers, not &s;o much through their own mi&s;con|duct, as through the appointment of Providence; and therefore to per&s;ons in this &s;ituation it may &s;eem more needful to offer con&s;olation, than to give admo|nition. However, as the evils which produce this impatience of life are of different &s;orts, a di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made as to the &s;ituations which can mo&s;t excu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Sometimes, the exclamation in the text may be oc|ca&s;ioned by deep overwhelming grief. When they whom we had mo&s;t affectionately loved, and in whom we had placed the felicity of our days, are taken away, our connection with life appears to be di&s;&s;olved. <Q>Why &s;hould we &s;urvive tho&s;e to whom our &s;ouls were tied? Would to God we had died before them? Now when they are gone all plea&s;ure and hope is gone as to us. To us the &s;un no longer &s;hines with his u&s;ual brightne&s;s. No longer cheerfulne&s;s inve&s;ts the face of nature. On every object a &s;ad gloom appears to re&s;t; and every employment of life is become an oppre&s;&s;ive burden.</Q> With the feelings of tho&s;e who are thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed we naturally &s;ympathi&s;e. They are frequently the feelings of the mo&s;t virtuous and amiable minds: And yet &s;uch per|&s;ons mu&s;t be told, that grief may be endulged &s;o far as to become immoderate and improper. There are bounds which are pre&s;cribed to it both by rea&s;on and by religion. A Chri&s;tian ought not to <HI>mourn like tho&s;e who have no hope.</HI> While he feels his &s;orrows as a man,
<PB N="7" REF="028306_0012_0FD894DF95914D20">he &s;hould al&s;o &s;tudy to bear them like a man, with fortitude; and not abandon him&s;elf to feeble and fruitle&s;s melancholy. Let him have recour&s;e to a &s;tren|uous di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation, and con|&s;ider it as incumbent on him to make the be&s;t improve|ment that he can of tho&s;e comforts which Providence has &s;till left in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again; it &s;ometimes happens that, apart from grief, great rever&s;es of worldly fortune give ri&s;e to the lamentation in the text. This was the ca&s;e with Job him&s;elf. A &s;udden fall from opulence into in|digence and want; &s;ome unde&s;erved di&s;grace incur|red, or &s;ome unexpected cloud thrown over former reputation and fame; the unkindne&s;s and de&s;ertion of friends, or the in&s;olent triumph of enemies, are apt to overwhelm the minds of men with gloom, and to reduce them to be weary of life. To per&s;ons under &s;uch calamities, &s;ympathy is due. That &s;ympathy, however, will be proportioned to the degree in which we con&s;ider them as free from blame in the misfortunes which they &s;uffer. As far as, through their own mi&s;conduct and vice, they have been the authors to them&s;elves of tho&s;e misfortunes, we withdraw our pity. The burthen which they have brought on them&s;elves we leave them to bear as they can; and with little concern we hear them ex|claim that their <HI>&s;ouls are weary of life.</HI>&mdash;Not only &s;o, but even in ca&s;es where calamities have fallen on the innocent, to the pity which we feel for them will be joined a &s;ecret contempt, if we perceive that together with their pro&s;perity, their courage and fortitude have al&s;o for&s;aken them. To abandon them&s;elves to de|jection carries no mark of a great or a worthy mind. In&s;tead of declaring that his <HI>&s;oul is weary of his life,</HI> it becomes a brave and a good man, in the evil day, with firmne&s;s to maintain his po&s;t; to bear up again&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="028306_0013_0FD894E0FB70FAE0">the &s;torm; to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e advantages which in the wor&s;t of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet ari&s;e.</P>
<P>It is good for per&s;ons in &s;uch &s;ituations to remark that, though Job was for a long while &s;everely tried by a variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;es, yet his condition was not left finally unhappy. On the contrary, the goodne&s;s of that God whom he had &s;erved returned at la&s;t, to &s;hine upon him with greater brightne&s;s than ever. His riches were re&s;tored to him twofold. The lo&s;&s;es in his family were repaired by a new offspring. His name became again renowned in the Ea&s;t; and <HI>the latter end of Job,</HI> we are told, <HI>was more ble&s;&s;ed than the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till, it may be a&s;ked, will not the continuance of long and &s;evere di&s;ea&s;e ju&s;tify the exclamation in the text, <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life!</HI> To per&s;ons who are for&s;aken by all the ble&s;&s;ings of health, and who have no pro&s;pect left, but that of lingering under &s;ickne&s;s or pain, Job's complaint may a&s;&s;uredly be forgiven more than to any others. Though it might be &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that even in old age and &s;ick|ne&s;s, except in very extreme ca&s;es, &s;ome re&s;ources are always left, of which they may avail them&s;elves for relief; yet it mu&s;t be admitted, that lawfully they may wi&s;h their &s;ufferings to be brought to an end. Still however they mu&s;t remember, that re&s;ignation to the plea&s;ure of heaven continues to be their duty to the la&s;t. As long as any part remains to be acted, as long as their continuance in the world can &s;erve any valuable purpo&s;e; it is more honourable to bear the load with magnanimity, than to give way to a querulous and dejected &s;pirit. It remains,</P>
<P N="3">III. To addre&s;s my&s;elf to another order of men, among whom, though more rarely than among tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="028306_0014_0FD894E33A89E6A0">whom I have de&s;cribed, the &s;entiment of the text is to be found. They are per&s;ons who have no parti|cular complaint to make of the inju&s;tice of the world, or the afflictions of their &s;tate. But they are tired of the vanity of the world, of its in&s;ipid en|joyments, and its perpetually revolving circle of tifles and follies. They feel them&s;elves made for &s;omething greater and nobler. They are di&s;gu&s;ted and hurt with the &s;cenes of wickedne&s;s that are often pa&s;&s;ing before their eyes. Their hearts are warmed with the thoughts of a purer and more perfect exi&s;t|ence de&s;igned for man; and in the moments of a&s;|piration after it, the exclamation breaks forth, <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life.&mdash;O that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly away and be at re&s;t. Lo then I would wander far off, and remain in the wilder|ne&s;s. I would ha&s;ten my e&s;cape from the windy &s;torm and tempe&s;t. For I have &s;een violence and &s;trife in the city. Wickedne&s;s is in the mid&s;t thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her &s;treets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lv. 6, 11.</NOTE>&mdash;In this view the &s;entiment in the text may &s;ometimes be that of a devout man. But &s;uch per&s;ons I mu&s;t admoni&s;h, that their devotion, how &s;incere however, is not al|together of a rational and cha&s;tened kind. It was from this temper that, in former ages of the church, the numerous race &s;prung of anchorets, hermits, and all the various orders who voluntarily abandoned the the world, to people the lonely de&s;arts and the mo|na&s;tic retreat. The ordinary cour&s;e of things &s;eem|ed below them as candidates for heaven. The con|cerns of the world appeared unworthy of their at|tention, and dangerous to their virtue. Breathing after a higher e&s;tate, they imagined that they could not ab&s;tract them&s;elves too much from every earthly

<P>Let us beware of all &s;uch imaginary refinements as produce a total di&s;reli&s;h of our pre&s;ent condition. They are, for the mo&s;t part, grafted either on di&s;|appointed pur&s;uits, or on a melancholy and &s;plenetic ca&s;t of mind. They are far from contributing to hap|pine&s;s, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with all the active virtues of man. This life de&s;erves not indeed to be put in competition with that ble&s;&s;ed immortality to which God has rai&s;ed our hopes. But &s;uch as it is, it is the gift of God. It is the &s;phere in which his wi&s;dom has placed us, and appointed us to act our parts. As long as it la&s;ts, we mu&s;t neither &s;light the duties which it requires, nor undervalue the innocent en|joyments which it offers. It belongs to a man to live among men as his brethren; which he who de|clares him&s;elf weary of life is not qualified to do with propriety.</P>
<P>Thus I have placed before you, in various views, the &s;entiment in the text; and have &s;hewn in what circum&s;tances, and from what cau&s;es, that di&s;reli&s;h of life ari&s;es which is often found among mankind. On a review of the whole, we cannot but acknow|ledge, that it is oftener to be a&s;cribed to our own vices and follies, than to any other cau&s;e. Among the mul|titudes in the world, to whom at this day, life is bur|den&s;ome, the far greater number is of tho&s;e who have rendered it &s;o to them&s;elves. Their idlene&s;s, their luxury and plea&s;ures, their criminal deeds, their im|moderate pa&s;&s;ions, their timidity and ba&s;ene&s;s of mind have dejected them in &s;uch a degree, as to make them weary of their exi&s;tence. Preyed upon by di&s;content of their own creating, they complain of life when they ought to reprehend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Various afflictions there doubtle&s;s are in the world;
<PB N="11" REF="028306_0016_0FD894E64690A618">many per&s;ons with whom we have cau&s;e to &s;ympa|thi&s;e, and whom we might rea&s;onably forgive for wi&s;hing death to clo&s;e their &s;orrows. But of the evils which embitter life, it mu&s;t be admitted, that the greater part is &s;uch as we have brought on our|&s;elves; or at lea&s;t &s;uch as, if we were not wanting to our&s;elves, might be tolerably &s;upported. When we compute the numbers of tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life,</HI> &s;ome there are to whom this &s;entiment is excu&s;able; but many more among whom it is in no way ju&s;tifiable. I admit that, among the worthie&s;t and the be&s;t, there may be dark moments in which &s;ome feeling of this nature may be apt to intrude upon their minds. But with them they are only moments of occa&s;ional and pa&s;&s;ing gloom. They &s;oon recall the vigour of their minds; and return with &s;atisfaction to the di&s;charge of the duties, and to a participation of the enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>One great cau&s;e of men's becoming weary of life is grounded on the mi&s;taken views of it which they have formed, and fal&s;e hopes which they have enter|tained from it. They have expected a &s;cene of en|joyment; and when they meet with di&s;appointments and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they complain of life, as if it had cheated and betrayed them. God ordained no &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for man on earth as continued plea&s;ure. For the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es he de&s;gined our &s;tate to be chequered with plea&s;ure and pain. As &s;uch let us receive it, and make the be&s;t of what is doomed to be our lot. Let us remain per&s;uaded, that &s;imple and moderate plea&s;ures are always the be&s;t; that vir|tue and a good con&s;cience are the &s;ure&s; foundations of enjoyment; that he who &s;erves his God and his Saviour with the pure&s;t intentions, and governs his pa&s;&s;ions with the greate&s;t care, is likely to lead the

<HEAD>SERMON II. ON <HI>CHARITY</HI> AS THE END OF THE <HI>COMMANDMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 TIMOTHY i. 5.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good con&s;cience, and of faith unfeigned.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from this chapter, that one de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle, in writing to Timothy, was to guard him again&s;t certain corrupters of Chri&s;tian doctrine, who had already ari&s;en in the church. To their fal&s;e repre&s;entations of religion he oppo&s;es that gen|eral view of it which is given in the text. Such &s;ummaries of religion frequently occur in the &s;acred writings; and are extremely u&s;eful. By the com|prehen&s;ive energy with which they expre&s;s the great lines of our duty, they both imprint them on our memory, and bring them home to our con&s;cience with force. In the progre&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, I hope
<PB N="13" REF="028306_0018_0FD894E958338A98">to make it appear, that the words of the text afford a mo&s;t enlarged and in&s;tructive view of religion in all its chief parts.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle pronounces charity to be <HI>the end</HI> or &s;cope <HI>of the commandment,</HI> that is, of the law of God. At the &s;ame time, in order to prevent mi&s;takes on this mo&s;t important &s;ubject, he &s;ubjoins to charity certain adjuncts, as nece&s;&s;ary to qualify it, and to render the Chri&s;tian character complete. The&s;e are the <HI>pure heart,</HI> the <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>faith unfeign|ed.</HI> In treating of the&s;e, I &s;hall &s;hew the nature of their connection with charity, and the importance of their being always united with it.</P>
<P><HI>The end of the commandment is charity.</HI> Charity is the &s;ame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Te&s;tament, to de|note all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;peculative ideas of general benevolence floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as &s;peculations too often do, un|touched and cold. Neither is it confined to that in|dolent good nature, which makes us re&s;t &s;atisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of &s;er|vice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a &s;ingle virtue; but a di&s;po&s;ition re&s;i|ding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, genero&s;ity, com|pa&s;&s;ion, and liberality, flow, as &s;o many native &s;treams. From general good-will to all, it extends its influence particularly to tho&s;e with whom we &s;tand in neare&s;t connection, and who are directly within the &s;phere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de&s;cends to the &s;maller a&s;&s;ociations of neighbourhood, relations, and friends; and &s;preads it&s;elf over the whole circle of
<PB N="14" REF="028306_0019_0FD894EAC25F0E40">&s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I mean not that it imports a promi&s;cuous undi&s;tingui&s;hing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we &s;hould endeavour to carry it &s;o far, would be ren|dered an impracticable virtue, and would re&s;olve it|&s;elf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to &s;hut our eyes to the di&s;|tinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to tho&s;e who befriend and tho&s;e who in|jure us. It re&s;erves our e&s;teem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it in&s;pires forgivene&s;s and humanity. It breathes uni|ver&s;al candour, and liberality of &s;entiment. It forms gentlene&s;s of temper, and dictates affability of man|ners. It prompts corre&s;ponding &s;ympathies with them who rejoice and them who weep. It teaches us to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e no man. Charity is the com|forter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the reconciler of differences, the interce&s;&s;or for of|fenders. It is faithfulne&s;s in the friend, public &s;pir|it in the magi&s;trate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the &s;overeign, and loyalty in the &s;ub|ject. In parents it is care and attention; in children it is reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In a word, it is the &s;oul of &s;ocial life, it is the &s;un that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is <HI>like the dew of Her|mon,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>and the dew that de&s;cendeth on the mountains of Zion where the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such charity, &s;ays the text, is <HI>the end of the com|mandment.</HI> This a&s;&s;ertion of the Apo&s;tle is undoubt|edly con&s;onant to all that rea&s;on can &s;ugge&s;t on the &s;ubject of religion. For, on con&s;idering the nature of the Supreme Being, rea&s;on gives us much ground
<PB N="15" REF="028306_0020_0FD894EC3A7DFFC0">to believe, that the chief de&s;ign of all the command|ments which he has given to men, is to promote their happine&s;s. Independent and &s;elf-&s;ufficient, that Su|preme Being has nothing to exact from us for his own intere&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> felicity. By our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervices he cannot be ben|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, nor by our offences injured. When he creat|ed the world, it was benevolence that moved him to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ence. When he made him&s;elf known to his creatures, benevolence in like manner moved him to give them laws for their conduct. Benevo|lence is the &s;pring of legi&s;lation in the Deity, as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch as it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tive of creation. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ued his commands on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th on purpo&s;e that by obedience to them, his creatures might be rendered happy among them&s;elves in this life, and be prepared for greater hap|pine&s;s in another. Charity, e&s;pecially when joined with purity, good con&s;cience, and faith, is obviou&s;ly the great in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e; and therefore mu&s;t needs po&s;&s;e&s;s the chief and primary place in the laws of God.</P>
<P>Accordingly, throughout the New Te&s;tament, it is uniform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y pre&s;ented to us to the &s;ame light in which it is placed by the text. This is known to all who have any acquaintance with the &s;acred books. Char|ity is termed <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI> and <HI>the bond of perfectne&s;s.</HI> It was a&s;&s;umed by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord as the characteri&s;tical di&s;tinction of his di&s;ciples; and in that magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icent eulogium which the Apo&s;tle Paul pronounces upon it, in the thirteenth chapter of the fir&s;t epi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle to the Corinthians, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;sly prefer|red by him to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope.</HI> This de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rves to be &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;idered by tho&s;e who are apt to undervalue charity, as an appendage of what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntemptu|ou&s;ly call Morality; while they confine tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e religion to &s;ome favourite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ts and ob&s;ervances of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eir own, which they con&s;idered as comprehending the &s;um of
<PB N="16" REF="028306_0021_0FD894EDC9B3FA70">what is acceptable to God. Such per&s;ons &s;how them|&s;elves profoundly ignorant of the nature of religion, and may too often be &s;u&s;pected of being &s;trangers to its influence. For, as the apo&s;tle John rea&s;ons, <HI>He that loveth not his brother, whom he hath &s;een, how can he love that God whom he hath not &s;een?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, while I a&s;cribe to charity that high place in the &s;y&s;tem of religion, which ju&s;tly be|longs to it, I am not to be under&s;tood as confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing all religion to this di&s;po&s;ition alone. With much wi&s;|dom and propriety, the text hath annexed to it cer|tain adjuncts, without which neither the character of a good man can be completed, nor charity it&s;elf ex|erci&s;ed to advantage. To the con&s;ideration of the&s;e I now proceed; and I enter the more readily on this branch of the &s;ubject, as there is ground to believe, that many pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s charity, without proper|ly under&s;tanding its nature and efficacy. There has been always an unhappy tendency among men to run to extremes, on one &s;ide or other, in matters of reli|gion, as one &s;et of men, who employ all their zeal on right belief, are prone to undervalue good practice; &s;o another &s;et who wi&s;h to be e&s;teemed, rational chri&s;|tians, are inclined to re&s;t the whole of their duty on charitable deeds, while they overlook certain di&s;po|&s;itions and habits which ought always to accompany them. It is therefore of importance, that the mi&s;|takes of both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men &s;hould be rectified, in order that religion may be held forth to the world in its complete form, and in its full and undimini&s;h|ed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t qualification of charity pointed out in the text is purity; <HI>charity out of a pure heart.</HI> Purity in|cludes the virtues which belong to the individual,
<PB N="17" REF="028306_0022_0FD894EF41382A10">con&s;idered in him&s;elf, and with re&s;pect to the govern|ment of his de&s;ires and plea&s;ures. It hath its &s;eat in the heart; but extends its influence over &s;o much of the outward conduct, as to form a great and ma|terial part of the character. They are only the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> we are told by our Saviour, <HI>who can &s;ee God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 8</NOTE> It is al&s;o true, that they are only the <HI>pure in heart</HI> who can properly di&s;charge their duties towards mankind. Inordinate love of plea&s;ure, intemper|ance, &s;en&s;uality, and a cour&s;e of irregular life, are incon&s;i&s;tent, not only with the general character of a good man, but al&s;o with the peculiar exerci&s;es of charity and benevolence. For nothing is more cer|tain, than that habits of licentious indulgence contri|bute to &s;tiffle all the good affections; to harden the heart; to nouri&s;h that &s;elfi&s;h attachment to our own vitious plea&s;ures which renders us in&s;en&s;ible to the circum&s;tances and wants of others. A profligate man is &s;eldom found to be a good hu&s;band, a good father, or a beneficent neighbour. How many young per&s;ons have at fir&s;t &s;et out in the world with excellent di&s;po|&s;itions of heart; generous, charitable, and humane; kind to their friends, and amiable among all with whom they had intercour&s;e? and yet how often have we &s;een all tho&s;e fair appearances unhappily bla&s;ted in the progre&s;s of life, merely through the influence of loo&s;e and currupting plea&s;ures; and tho&s;e very per&s;ons who promi&s;ed once to be ble&s;&s;ings to the world, &s;unk down, in the end, to be the burthen and nui&s;ance of &s;ociety? The profu&s;ion of expence which their plea|&s;ures occa&s;ion, accounts in a great mea&s;ure for the fatal rever&s;e that takes place in their character. It not only drains the &s;ources whence the &s;treams of beneficence &s;hould flow, but often obliges them to
<PB N="18" REF="028306_0023_0FD894F0C667D4E0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">me oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel to tho&s;e whom it was their duty to have patroni&s;ed and &s;upported.</P>
<P>Purity of heart and conduct mu&s;t therefore be held fundamental to charity and love, as well as to gen|eral piety and virtue. The licentious I know are ready to imagine, that their occa&s;ional deeds of boun|ty and liberality will atone for many of their private di&s;orders. But, be&s;ides that &s;uch plans of compenia|tion for vices, by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed virtues, are always fallacious, the licentious may be a&s;&s;ured, that it is an appearance only of charity, not the reality of it, to which they can lay claim. For that great virtue con&s;i&s;ts not in occa&s;ional actions of humanity, in fits of kindne&s;s or compa&s;&s;ion, to which bad men may be prompted by natural in&s;tinct; but in the &s;teady and regular exerci&s;e of tho&s;e good affections, and the di&s;charge of tho&s;e important duties towards others, for which the licentious are in a great mea&s;ure di&s;|qualified. Their criminal propen&s;ities direct their inclinations to very different objects and pur&s;uits; and often determine them to &s;acrifice the ju&s;t rights of others, &s;ometimes to &s;acrifice the peace and the re|putation of the innocent, to the gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions. Such is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pernicious influence which the love of plea&s;ure has on the good qualities of its devot|ed votaries. The impure heart is like the &s;tagnant and putrifying lake, which &s;ends forth its poi&s;onous exhalations to corrupt and wither every plant that grows on its banks.</P>
<P>The &s;econd qualification annexed to Charity, in the text, is, that it be <HI>of a good con&s;cience</HI> By this I under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle to mean, that charity be in full con&s;i&s;tency with ju&s;tice and integrity; that the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> of the man who purpo&s;es to perform ac|tions of benevolence, be free from the reproach of hav|ing neglected the primary duties of equity. For,
<PB N="19" REF="028306_0024_0FD894F23A745718">undoubtedly, ju&s;tice is a virtue primary to charity; that is, it mu&s;t go before it in all its exertions, One mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>do ju&s;tly</HI> before he can pretend that he <HI>loves mercy.</HI>&mdash;Religion, my friends, in order to render it u&s;eful to mankind, mu&s;t be brought down by its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each|ers from the &s;ublimity of &s;peculation to the functions and occupations of ordinary life. It is my duty to admoni&s;h you, that you mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, be fair in all your dealings with others; you mu&s;t di&s;|charge the debts you owe; you mu&s;t pay the wages due to your &s;ervants and dependents; you mu&s;t provide for your own family, and be ju&s;t to the claims of re|lations; then, and then only, you can, <HI>from a good con|&s;cience,</HI> as the text enjoins, perform acts of genero&s;ity and mercy.</P>
<P>This leads to a reflection which here de&s;erves our attention; that, in order to fulfil that <HI>charity which is the end of the commandment,</HI> oeconomy, and good order in private life, ought to be carefully &s;tudied by all Chri&s;tians. This is more clo&s;ely connected with <HI>a good con&s;cience,</HI> than many &s;eem inclined to admit. Oeconomy, when prudently and temperately con|ducted, is the &s;afeguard of many virtues; and is in a particular manner favourable to the exertions of benevolence. He who by incon&s;iderate conduct is injuring his circum&s;tances, will probably in time lo&s;e the inclination, and certainly is depriving him|&s;elf o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the means, of being &s;erviceable to his brethren. Some important exertions, indeed, there are of charity, which have no connection with giving or be&s;towing. Candour, forgivene&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and &s;ympathy, are due to our brethren at all times, and in every &s;ituation of our own fortune. The poor have opportunities for di&s;playing the&s;e virtues, as well as the rich. They who have nothing to give can often afford relief to others, by imparting what they feel. But, as far as beneficence is included in
<PB N="20" REF="028306_0025_0FD894F3C0DBE4F8">charity, we ought always to remember, that ju&s;tice mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, inviolably be held &s;acred.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of &s;cripture remarkably appears, in the connection pointed out by the text between <HI>cha|rity</HI> and <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> or integrity; a connection which I apprehend is often not attended to &s;o much as it de&s;erves. Among the frugal and indu&s;trious, great regard is commonly paid to ju&s;tice. They will not defraud. They will not take any unlawful advantage in their dealings: And &s;atisfied with this degree of <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> they are &s;trangers to that cha|rity, which is the <HI>end of the commandment.</HI> They are hard and unfeeling. They are rigid and &s;evere in their demands. They know nothing of humanity, forgivene&s;s, or compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Among another cla&s;s of men, who have been more liberally educated, and who are generally of a higher rank in life, ju&s;tice is apt to be con&s;idered as a virtue le&s;s noble than chari|ty; and which may, on &s;ome occa&s;ions be di&s;pen&s;ed with. They are humane perhaps, and tender in their feelings. They are ea&s;y to their dependents. They can be liberal, even to profu&s;ion. While, at the &s;ame time, they are accumulating debts, which they know them&s;elves unable to di&s;charge. Their affairs are al|lowed to run into confu&s;ion. Oeconomy and good order are neglected. The innocent, in great num|bers, &s;uffer materially through their mi&s;manage|ment: And all the while they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the prai&s;e of being generous and good-hearted men. This &s;urely is not that <HI>charity</HI> which the Go&s;pel en|joins; and which, in its very e&s;&s;ence, involves <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> and integrity. He who pretends to do good to his brethren, without fir&s;t doing them ju&s;tice, cannot be accounted their real friend. True charity is not a meteor, which, occa&s;ionally glares; but a luminary, which, in its orderly and regular cour&s;e, di&s;pen&s;es a benignant influence.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028306_0026_0FD894F5402C3468">
The third and la&s;t adjunct connected in the text with charity is, that it be <HI>of faith unfeigned</HI> Faith in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of it, includes the whole of re|ligious principles re&s;pecting God, and re&s;pecting Chri&s;t. Good principles, without good practice, I confe&s;s, are nothing; they are of no avail in the &s;ight of God, nor in the e&s;timation of wi&s;e men, But practice not founded on principle is likely to be al|ways un&s;table and wavering; and, therefore, the faith of religious principles enters, for a very con&s;i|derable &s;hare, into the proper di&s;charge of the duties of charity.</P>
<P>It will be admitted that, without faith, our duties towards God cannot be properely performed. You may be a&s;&s;ured that your duties towards men will al|ways greatly &s;uffer from the want of it. Faith, when pure and genuine, &s;upplies to every part of virtue and in particular to the virtue of charity, many motives and a&s;&s;i&s;tances, of which the unbeliever is de&s;titute. He who acts from faith acts upon the high principle of regard to the God who hath made him, and to the Saviour who redeems him; which will often &s;timu|late him to his duty when other principles of benevo|lence become faint and languid, or are cro&s;&s;ed by op|po&s;ite intere&s;ts. When he con&s;iders him&s;elf as pur|&s;uing the approbation of that divine Being, from whom love de&s;cends, a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m both prompts, and con&s;ecrates, his charitable di&s;po&s;itions. Regardle&s;s of men, or of human recompence, he is carried along by a higher impul&s;e. He acts with the &s;pirit of a follower of the Son of God, who not only has enjoined love, but has enforced it by the example of laying down his life for mankind. Whatever he does in behalf of his fellow-creatures, he con&s;iders him&s;elf as doing, in &s;ome degree, to that divine Per|&s;on, who hath &s;aid, <HI>Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto

It acquires addition|al dignity and energy from being connected with the heavenly &s;tate and the heavenly inhabitants He mingles with beings of a higher order, while he is di&s;charging his duty to his fellow creatures on earth; and by joining faith and piety to good works he com|pletes the character of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to explain the full &s;en&s;e of that comprehen&s;ive view of religion which is giv|en in the text. I have &s;hown in what re&s;pects <HI>char|ity</HI> joined with <HI>the pure heart, the good con&s;cience, and faith unfeigned</HI> forms <HI>the end of the commandment.</HI> Let us ever keep in view tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential parts of a virtu|ous character, and pre&s;erve them in their proper uni|on. Thus &s;hall our religion ri&s;e into a regular and well-proportioned edifice, where each part gives firmne&s;s and &s;upport to another. If any one of tho&s;e material parts be wanting in the &s;tructure; if, our &s;y&s;tem of charity, either purity, or ju&s;tice, or faith, be left, there will be cracks and &s;laws in the building which prepare its ruin.</P>
<P>This is indeed one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t frequent errors of men, in their moral conduct. They take hold of virtue by pieces and corners only. Few are &s;o depraved as to be without all &s;en&s;e of duty, and all regard to it. To &s;ome moral qualities, which appear to them amiable or e&s;timable, almo&s;t all men lay claim; and on the&s;e they re&s;t their worth, in their own e&s;timation. But the&s;e &s;cattered pieces of virtue, not uniting into one whole, nor forming a con&s;i&s;tent character, have no powerful influence on their general habits of life. From various unguard|ed

<P>My times are in thy hand.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;un that rolls over our heads, the food that we receive, the re&s;t that we enjoy, daily admon|i&s;h us of a &s;uperior power, on whom the inhabitants of the earth depend for light, life, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But as long as all things proceed in their ordinary cour&s;e; when day returns after day with perfect &s;im|ilarity; when our life &s;eems &s;tationary, and nothing occurs to warn us of any approaching change, the religious &s;entiments of dependence are apt to be for|gotten. The great revolutions of time, when they come round in their &s;tated order, have a tendency to
<PB N="24" REF="028306_0029_0FD894FB49F7AE78">force &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions of piety even on the mo&s;t un|thinking minds. They both mark our exi&s;tence on earth to be advancing towards its clo&s;e, and exhibit our condition as continually changing; while each returning year brings along with it new events and at the &s;ame time carries us forwards to the conclu&s;ion of all. We cannot, on &s;uch occa&s;ions avoid perceiv|ing that there is a Supreme Being who holds in his hands the line of our exi&s;tence, and mea&s;ures out to each of us our allotted portion of that line. Beyond a certain limit, we know that it cannot be extended; and long before it reach that limit it may be cut a&s;under by an invi&s;ible hand, which is &s;tretched forth over all the inhabitants of the world. Then natur|ally ari&s;es the ejaculation of the text, <HI>My times. O God, are in thy hand.</HI><Q>My fate depends on thee. The duration of my life, and all the events which in future days are to fill it, are entirely at thy di&s;|po&s;al.</Q>&mdash;Let us now, when we have ju&s;t &s;een one year clo&s;e, and another begin, mediate &s;eriou&s;ly on this &s;entiment. Let us con&s;ider what is implied in <HI>our times being in the hand of God;</HI> and to what im|provement this meditation leads.</P>
<P>The text evidently implies, fir&s;t, that <HI>our times</HI> are not in our own hands; that, as our continuance in life depends not on our&s;elves, &s;o the events which are to happen, while life remains, are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. Of this we may behold many a proof, when we look back on the tran&s;actions of the year which is ju&s;t fini&s;hed. Recollection will readily pre&s;ent to us a bu&s;y period, filled up with a mixture of bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement, of anxteties and cares, of joys and &s;orrows. We have talked, perhaps and acted much. We have formed many a plan; in public or in private life, we have been engaged in a variety of pur&s;uits. Let me
<PB N="25" REF="028306_0030_0FD894FCC79FF338">now a&s;k, how &s;mall a proportion of all that has hap|pened could have been fore&s;een, or foretold by us? How many things have occured, of which we had no expectation; &s;ome, perhaps, that have &s;ucceeded be|yond our hopes; many, al&s;o, that have befallen us contrary to our wi&s;h? How often were each of us ad|moni&s;hed that there are &s;ecret wheels, which, un&s;een by us, bring about the revolutions of human affairs; and that, while man was devi&s;ing his way, Provi|dence was directing the event?</P>
<P>That &s;cene is now clo&s;ed. The tale of that year has been told. We look forward to the year which is beginning; and what do we behold there?&mdash;All, my brethren is a blank to our view: A dark un|known pre&s;ents it&s;elf. We are entering on an untri|ed, undi&s;covered country, where, as each &s;ucceeding month comes forward, new &s;cenes may open; new objects may engage our attention; changes at home or abroad, in public or private affairs, may alter the whole &s;tate of our fortune. New connections may be at hand to be formed, or old ones ju&s;t about to be di&s;&s;olved; perhaps, we may have little more to do with this world, or with any of its connections; we may be &s;tanding on the verge of time and life, and on the point of pa&s;&s;ing into a new region of exi&s;tence. In &s;hort the pro&s;pect before us is full of awful uncer|tainty. Life and death, pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, health and &s;ickne&s;s, joy and trouble, lie in one un|di&s;tingui&s;hable ma&s;s, where our eye can de&s;cry no|thing through the ob&s;curity that wraps them up.</P>
<P>While it is thus certain that <HI>our times</HI> are not at our own di&s;po&s;al, we are taught, by the text, that they are <HI>in the hand of God.</HI> This may be con&s;ider|ed in two views. Our times are in the hand of God, as a &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of events. They are in the hand of God as a Guardian and a Father.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028306_0031_0FD894FE4AC4D600">
<HI>Our times,</HI> I &s;ay <HI>are in the hands of God</HI> as a &s;u|preme irre&s;i&s;tible Ruler. All that is to happen to us in this and the &s;ucceeding years of our life,&mdash;if any &s;ucceeding years we &s;hall be allowed to &s;ee,&mdash;has been foreknown and arranged by God. The fir&s;t view, under which human affairs pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, is that of confu&s;ed and irregular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The events of the world &s;eem thrown together by chance, like the billows of the &s;ea, tumbling and to&s;|&s;ing over each other, without rule or order. All that is apparent to us is the fluctuation of human caprice, and the operation of human pa&s;&s;ions. We &s;ee the &s;trife of ambition, and the efforts of &s;tratagem, la|bouring to accompli&s;h their &s;everal purpo&s;es among the &s;ocieties of men. But it is no more than the &s;ur|face, the out&s;ide of things, that we behold. Higher coun&s;els, than it is in our power to trace, are concern|ed in the tran&s;actions of the world. If we believe in God at all, as the Governor of the univer&s;e, we mu&s;t believe that, without his providence, nothing happens on earth. He over-rules, at his plea&s;ure, the pa&s;&s;ions of men. He bends all their de&s;igns into &s;ub&s;erviency to his decree. <HI>He makes the wrath of man to prai&s;e him</HI> and <HI>re&s;trains,</HI> in what mea&s;ure he thinks <HI>the remainder of wrath.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxvi. 10.</NOTE> He brings forth in their cour&s;e all the generations of men. When the time is come for their entering into light, they appear on the &s;tage; and when the time fixed for their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion arrives, he <HI>changes their countenance,</HI> and &s;ends them away. The time of our appearing is now come, after our ance&s;tors had left their place, and gone down to the du&s;t. We are at pre&s;ent permit|ted to act our part freely, and without con&s;traint. No violence is done to our inclination or choice.
<PB N="27" REF="028306_0032_0FD894FFBB10C210">But a&s;&s;uredly their is not a day of our life nor an event in that day, but was fore&s;een by God. That &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of occurrences, which to us is full of ob&s;curity and darkne&s;s, is all light and order in his view. He &s;ees from the beginning to the end, and brings forward every thing that happens, in its due time and place.</P>
<P><HI>Our times are</HI> altogether <HI>in his hand.</HI> Let us take notice, that they are not in the hands either of our enemies, or of our friends. It is not in the power of man to &s;horten or to prolong our life, more or le&s;s than God has decreed. Enemies may employ craft or violence in their attacks; friends may employ &s;kill and vigilance for the pre&s;ervation of our health and &s;afety; but both the one and the other can have effect only as far as God permits. They work in &s;ub&s;ervi|ency to his purpo&s;e. By him they are held in invi&s;ible bonds. To the exertions of all human agents he &s;ays, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no further.</HI></P>
<P>We are to ob&s;erve next, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God,</HI> not only as an almighty Di&s;po&s;er, but as a merciful Guardian and Father. We are by no means to imagine, that from race to race, and from year to year, God &s;ports with the lives of &s;ucceeding generations of men, or, in the mere wantonne&s;s of arbitrary power, brings them forth, and &s;ends them away. No; if we have any confidence in what ei|ther the light of nature &s;ugge&s;ts to all men, or what the revelation of the go&s;pel has confirmed to Chri&s;|tians, we have full ground to believe, that the admin|i&s;tration of human affairs is conducted with infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. The coun&s;els of the Almigh|ty are indeed too deep for our limited under&s;tandings to trace. <HI>His path</HI> may often, as to as, be <HI>in the &s;ea, and his foot&s;teps in the mighty waters;</HI> while, neverthe|le&s;s, <HI>all his paths are mercy and truth.</HI> He who, from
<PB N="28" REF="028306_0033_0FD895013AA95968">the benignity of his nature, erected this world for the abode of men; He who furni&s;hed it &s;o richly for our accommodation, and &s;tored it with &s;o much beauty for our entertainment; He who &s;ince fir&s;t we entered into life, hath followed us with &s;uch a variety of mer|cies, &s;urely can have no plea&s;ure in our di&s;appoint|ment and di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>He knows our frame; he remembers we are du&s;t;</HI> and looks to frail man, we are a&s;&s;ured, with <HI>&s;uch pity as a father beareth to his children.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ciii. 13, 14.</NOTE> To him we may &s;afely commit our&s;elves, and all our concerns; as to one who is be&s;t qualified, both to di|rect the incidents proper to happen to us in this world, and to judge of the time when it is fit for us to be re|moved from it.</P>
<P>Even that ignorance of our future de&s;tiny in life, of which we &s;ometimes complain, is a &s;ingle proof of his goodne&s;s. He hides from us the view of fu|turity, becau&s;e the view would be dangerous and over|powering. It would either di&s;pirit us with vi&s;ions of terror, or intoxicate us by the di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. The veil which covers from our &s;ight the events of this and of &s;ucceeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy. Our <HI>times are in his hand;</HI> and we have rea&s;on to be glad that in his hand they are kept, &s;hut out from our view. Submit to his plea&s;ure as an almighty Ruler we mu&s;t, becau&s;e we cannot re&s;i&s;t him. Equal rea&s;on there is for tru&s;ting in him as a Guardian, under who&s;e di&s;po&s;al we are &s;ate.</P>
<P>Such is the import of the text, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> Our times are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. They are in the hands of God as a Governor and Ruler; in the hands of God as a Guardian and Father. The&s;e &s;eparate views of the text require, on our part, &s;eparate im|provements.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028306_0034_0FD895039547EFE0">
Seeing our times are not in our own hand, &s;ee|ing futurity is unknown to us, let us, fir&s;t, check the vain curio&s;ity of penetrating into what is to come. Conjecture about futurity we often mu&s;t; but upon all conjectures of what this year is to produce, let us lay a proper re&s;traint. Let us wait till God &s;hall bring forward events in their proper cour&s;e, without wi&s;h|ing to di&s;cover what he has concealed; le&s;t, if the di&s;|covery were granted, we &s;hould &s;ee many things, which we would wi&s;h not to have &s;een.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common propen&s;ity of mankind is to &s;tore futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; e&s;peci|ally in tho&s;e periods of life when imagination is live|ly, and hope is ardent. Looking forward to the year now beginning, they are ready to promi&s;e them&s;elves much from the foundations of pro&s;perity which they have laid; from the friend&s;hips and connections which they have &s;ecured; from the plans of conduct which they have formed. Alas! how deceitful do all the&s;e dreams of happine&s;s often prove! While many are &s;aying in &s;ecret to their hearts, <HI>To-morrow &s;hall be as this day and more abundantly,</HI> we are obliged in return to &s;ay to them, <HI>Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow, for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth.</HI> I do not mean, that in the unknown pro&s;pect which lies before us, we &s;hould forebode to our&s;elves nothing but mi&s;|fortunes. &mdash;May it be the plea&s;ure of Heaven that this year run on in a placid and tranquil tenor to us all!&mdash;But this I &s;ay, that in &s;uch fore&s;ight of futu|rity as we are allowed to take, we may reckon upon it as certain, that this year &s;hall prove to us, as many pa&s;t have proved, a chequered &s;cene of &s;ome com|forts and &s;ome troubles. In what proportion one or other of the&s;e &s;hall prevail in it; whether, when it ends, it &s;hall leave with us the memory of joys or of &s;orrows, is to be determined by him in who&s;e hands
<PB N="30" REF="028306_0035_0FD895054CA30FC8"><HI>our times are.</HI> Our wi&s;dom is, to be prepared for whatever the year is to bring; prepared to receive comforts with thankfulne&s;s, troubles with fortitude; and to improve both for the great purpo&s;es of virtue and eternal life.</P>
<P>Another important in&s;truction which naturally a|ri&s;es from our times not being in our own hands is, that we ought no longer to trifle with what it is not in our power to prolong; but that we &s;hould make ha&s;te to live as wi&s;e men; nor delaying till to-morrow what may be done to day; <HI>doing now with all our might whatever our hand findeth to do;</HI> before that <HI>night cometh wherein no man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Admi&s;ts the uncertainty of the events which are be|fore us, there is one thing we have too much rea&s;on to believe namely, that of us who are now a&s;&s;embled in this congregation, and who have &s;een the year begin, there are &s;ome who &s;hall not &s;urvive to &s;ee it clo&s;e. Whether it &s;hall be you, or you, or I, who &s;hall be gathered to our fathers before the revolving year has fini&s;hed its round, God alone knows. <HI>Our times are in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and?</HI> But to our place, it is more than proba|ble that &s;ome of us &s;hall have gone. Could we foretel the month, or the day, on which our change was to happen, how diligent would we be in &s;etting our hou&s;e in order, and preparing our&s;elves to appear be|fore our Maker? Surely, that ought to be prepared for with mo&s;t care, concerning which we are igno|rant how &s;oon it is to take place. Let us therefore <HI>walk circum&s;pectly,</HI> and <HI>redeem the time.</HI> Let us di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e trivial and &s;uper&s;luous cares which burden or corrupt our life, in order to attend to what is of highe&s;t importance to us as men and Chri&s;tians. The beginning of each year &s;hould carry to us all a &s;olemn admonition of our folly, in neglecting to improve &s;uitably the years that are pa&s;t. It &s;hould call up
<PB N="31" REF="028306_0036_0FD895067B56C008">mi&s;pent time into our view; and be like the hand coming forth upon the wall, in the days of Bel&s;hazzar, and writing in legibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> characters over again&s;t us, <Q>O man! thy days are numbered; thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting; take care le&s;t thy kingdom be on the point of departing from thee.</Q></P>
<P>When we con&s;ider, in the next place, that our times as I before illu&s;trated, are in the hand of God as a &s;o|vereign Di&s;po&s;er, it is an obvious inference from this truth, that we &s;hould prepare our&s;elves to &s;ubmit pa|tiently to his plea&s;ure both as to the events which are to fill up our days, and as to the time of our continu|ing in this world. To contend with him we know to be fruitle&s;s. The word that is gone ont of his moath mu&s;t &s;tand. In the path which he has marked out for us, whether it be &s;hort or long, rugged or &s;mooth, we mu&s;t walk. Is it not then the dictate of wi&s;dom, that we &s;hould previou&s;ly reconcile our&s;elves to this &s;overign ordination, and bring our minds to harmon|ize with what is appointed to be our de&s;tiny? Let us fortify this temper, by recalling that reflection of the wi&s;e man; <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life; all the days of his vain life which he &s;pendeth as a &s;hadow?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. v 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>To enjoy long life, and &s;ee many days, is the uni|ver&s;al with; and, as the wi&s;h is proinpted by nature it cannot be in it&s;elf unlawful. At the &s;ame time, &s;everal circum&s;tances concur to temper the eagerne&s;s of this wi&s;h; and to &s;how us that it &s;hould always be formed under due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the wi&s;er judge|ment of Heaven. Who among us can tell, whe|ther, in wi&s;hing for the continuance of many years on earth, we may not be only wi&s;hing for a prolonga|tion
<PB N="32" REF="028306_0037_0FD87F3BC5817068">of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery?&mdash;You might live, my friends, till you had undergone lingering rounds of &s;evere pain, from which death would have proved a &s;ea&s;onable deliverance. You might live till your brea&s;ts were pierced with many a wound from public calamities or private &s;orrows. You might live till you beheld the death of all whom you had loved; till you &s;urvived all tho&s;e who love you; till you were left as de&s;olate &s;trangers on earth, in the mid&s;t of a new race, who neither knew you, nor cared for you, but who wi&s;hed you off the &s;tage.&mdash;Of a nature &s;o ambiguous are all the pro&s;pects which life &s;ets before us, that in every wi&s;h we form, relating to them, much rea&s;on we have to be &s;atisfied that our times are in the hands of God, rather than our own.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration is greatly &s;trengthened when, in the la&s;t place, we think of God acting, not as a Sovereign only, but as a Guardian, in the di&s;po&s;al of our times. This is our great con&s;olation in look|ing forward to futurity. To God as a wi&s;e Ruler, calm &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is due; but it is more than &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion that belongs to him as a merciful Father; it is the &s;pirit of cordial and affectionate con&s;ent to his will. Unknown to us as the times to come are, it &s;hould be &s;ufficient to our full repo&s;e that they are known to God. The day and the hour which are fixed in his coun&s;els for our di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from life, we ought to be per&s;uaded are fixed for the be&s;t; and that any longer we &s;hould not wi&s;h to remain.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee that la&s;t hour drawing nigh, though our &s;pirits may be compo&s;ed on our own account, yet, on account of our friends and families, no little anxiety and &s;orrow may be &s;ometimes apt to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind. Long we have enjoyed the com|fort of their &s;ociety, and been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider them as parts of our&s;elves. To be parted from them
<PB N="33" REF="028306_0038_0FD89508009B9FD8">forever is, at any rate, a bitter thought; but to the bitterne&s;s of this, is over and above added the appre|hen&s;ion of their &s;uffering much by our death. We leave many a relation, perhaps may leave young chil|dren, and a helple&s;s family, behind us, to be expo&s;|ed to various dangers, and thrown forth on an un|friendly world. Such virtuous anxieties often oppre&s;s the tender and feeling heart at the clo&s;ing periods of life.&mdash;My brethren, look up to that God, in who&s;e hands <HI>the times</HI> of your fathers were; in who&s;e hand <HI>the times</HI> of your po&s;terity &s;hall be.

Why &s;hould they be for&s;aken by him in times to come; Well did he govern the world before you had a being in it: Well &s;hall he continue to govern it af|ter you are no more. No cau&s;e have you, therefore, to oppre&s;s your minds with the load of unknown fu|turity. Commit your cares to a Father in heaven. Surrender your friends, and your family, to that God, who hath &s;aid, <HI>The children of his &s;ervants &s;hall con|tinue, and their &s;eed &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cii. 28.</NOTE>&mdash; <HI>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children, I will pre&s;erve them alive; and let thy widows tru&s;t in me.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xlix. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have thus &s;hewn what the import is, and what the improvement &s;hould be, of the doctrine of the text, that <HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> It a&s;&s;erts a fact, the the truth of which can be called in que&s;|tion by none; a fact which, whether per&s;ons have any &s;entiments of religion or not, is calculated to make a &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion on every mind; e&s;pecial|ly at &s;ea&s;ons when the revolution of years gives us warning that our duration on earth is mea&s;ured, and advances towards its period. To per&s;ons who are

<P>THE parable, of which the&s;e words are a part, contains a prophetical de&s;cription of the &s;tate of the church. Our Lord predicts that the &s;ocieties of Chri&s;tians were to be infected with per&s;ons of loo&s;e principles and bad di&s;po&s;ition, whom he likens to <HI>tares</HI> &s;pringing up among <HI>wheat.</HI> He intimates that there &s;hould ari&s;e &s;ome who&s;e officious zeal would prompt the de&s;ire of exterminating immediately all &s;uch evil men; but that this were contrary to the de|&s;igns of providence, and to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity; that a complete &s;eparation was indeed to be made at la&s;t between the good and the bad; but that this &s;e|peration was to be delayed till the end of the world, when, in the &s;tile of the parable, the <HI>tares</HI> &s;hould be entirely <HI>gathered out from among the wheat. Let both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When we look around us, nothing is more con&s;pi|cuous in the &s;tate of the world, than that broad mix|ture of the religious and the impious, the virtuous and the wicked, which we find taking place in every &s;ociety. Strong objections &s;eem hence to ari&s;e again&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="028306_0041_0FD8950D3A5E6DB8">either the wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s of divine Providence; e&s;pecially when we behold bad men not only tolerated in the world, but occa&s;ionally exalted in their cir|cum&s;tances, to the depre&s;&s;ion of the ju&s;t. Why, it will be &s;aid, if a Supreme Being exi&s;t, and if his ju&s;tice rule the univer&s;e, does he allow &s;uch infamous per&s;ons as the records of hi&s;tory often pre&s;ent, to have a place, and even to make a figure in his world? Why &s;leeps the thunder idle in his hand, when it could &s;o ea&s;ily bla&s;t them? What &s;hall we think of one who, having the power of exterminat|ing them always at his command, permits them to proceed without di&s;turbance; nay, &s;ometimes ap|pears to look on them with complacency?&mdash;It be|comes highly worthy of our attention to con&s;ider what an&s;wer can be made to the&s;e objections; to inquire whether any rea&s;ons can be given that &s;erve to ju&s;tify this di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, in allowing a mix|ture of bad men to continue on the face of the earth until the end of time. This inquiry &s;hall make the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, together with &s;uch re|flections as naturally ari&s;e from &s;urveying the &s;tate of human affairs.</P>
<P>But, before entering directly on &s;uch inquiry, it may be proper to take notice, that, in our e&s;timation of who are the good, who are the bad, we are often in hazard of committing mi&s;takes. The real cha|racters of men are known only to God. They fre|quently depend on the &s;ecret and un&s;een parts of life. As in judging of them&s;elves men are always partial, &s;o in judging of others they often err, through the imperfect information which they have gathered, or the ra&s;h prejudices which they have formed. They are too apt to limit the character of virtue to tho&s;e who agree wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h them in &s;entiment and belief; and exaggerate the failings of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they
<PB N="37" REF="028306_0042_0FD8950EC66AB340">have conceived di&s;like, into great and unpardonable crimes. Were it left to the indi&s;creet zeal of &s;ome to extirpate from the earth all tho&s;e whom they con|&s;ider as bad men, there is ground to apprehend that, in&s;tead of tares the wheat would often be rooted out.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, we readily admit the fact, as too manife&s;t to be denied, that a multitude of gro&s;s and notorious &s;inners are now mixed with the followers of God and virtue. Let us proceed then to con&s;ider how far this is con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of the Govenor of the world.</P>
<P>It is a principle in which all &s;erious and reflecting per&s;ons have agreed, and which by many arguments is confirmed, that our pre&s;ent &s;tate on earth is de&s;ign|ed to be a &s;tate of di&s;cipline and improvement, in or|der to fit human nature for a higher and better &s;tate which it is to attain hereafter. Now, this principle being once admitted, we &s;ay, that the mixture of vir|tue and vice which here prevails, is calculated to an|&s;wer this purpo&s;e better than a more unmixed and perfect &s;tate of &s;ociety would have done.</P>
<P>For, in the fir&s;t place, the crimes of the wicked give occa&s;ion to the exerci&s;e of many excellent di&s;po|&s;itions of heart among the righteous. They bring forth all the &s;uffering virtues, which otherwi&s;e would have had no field; and by the exerci&s;e of which the human character is tried, and acquires &s;ome of its chief honours. Were there no bad men in the world to vex and di&s;tre&s;s the good, the good might appear in the light of harmle&s;s innocence; but could have no opportunity of di&s;playing fidelity, magnanimity, patience, and fortitude. One half of virtue, and not the lea&s;t important half, would be lo&s;t to the world. In our pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, any virtue which is never exerci&s;ed is in hazard of becoming extinct in the human brea&s;t. If goodne&s;s con&s;tantly proceeded
<PB N="38" REF="028306_0043_0FD895103B4101A0">in a &s;mooth and flowery path; if, meeting with no adver&s;ary to oppo&s;e it, it were &s;urrounded on every hand with acclamation and prai&s;e, is there no ground to dread that it might be corrupted by vanity, or might &s;ink into indolence? This dangerous calm mu&s;t there|fore be interrupted. The waters mu&s;t be troubled, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;tagnate and putrify. When you be|hold wicked men multiplying in number, and increa&s;|ing in power, imagine not that Providence particular|ly favours them. No; they are &s;uffered for a time to pro&s;per, that they may fulfil the high de&s;igns of heaven. They are employed as in&s;truments in the hand of God for the improvement of his &s;ervants. They are the rods with which he cha&s;tens the virtu|ous, in order to rou&s;e them from a dangerous &s;lum|ber; to form them for the day of adver&s;ity, and to teach them how to &s;uffer honourably.</P>
<P>In the next place, the mixture of the bad among the good &s;erves not only to give exerci&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ive graces, but al&s;o to improve the active powers and vir|tues of man. It inures the righteous to vigilance and exertion. It obliges them to &s;tand forth, and act their part with firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy in evil times. It gives occa&s;ion for their virtues to &s;hine with con&s;pi|cuous lu&s;tre; and makes them appear as <HI>the lights of the world</HI> amid&s;t &s;urrounding darkne&s;s. Were it not for the dangers that ari&s;e from abounding iniquity, there would be no opportunity for courage to act, for wi&s;dom to admoni&s;h, for caution to watch, nor for faith to exert it&s;elf in <HI>overcoming the world.</HI> It is that mixture of di&s;po&s;ition which now takes place, that renders the theatre on which we act &s;o bu&s;y and &s;tir|ring, and &s;o much fitted for giving employment to every part of man's intelligent and moral nature. It affords a complete field for the genuine di&s;play of cha|racters; and gives every man the opportunity to come
<PB N="39" REF="028306_0044_0FD87F3D5A194258">forth and &s;how what he is. Were the terror of hu|man conduct altogether regular and uniform, inter|rupted by no follies and vices, no cro&s;s di&s;po&s;itions and irregular pa&s;&s;ions, many of our active powers would find no exerci&s;e. Perhaps even our life would langui&s;h, and become too &s;till and in&s;ipid. Man is not yet ripe for a paradi&s;e of innocence, and for the enjoyment of a perfect and faultle&s;s &s;ociety. As in the natural world, he is not made for perpetual &s;pring and cloudle&s;s &s;kies, but by the wintry &s;torm mu&s;t be calied to exert his abilities for procuring &s;helter and defence; &s;o in the moral world, intermixture of bad men renders many an exertion nece&s;&s;ary, which in a perfect &s;tate of the world would find no place, but which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trial is proper and u&s;e|ful.&mdash;The exi&s;tence of vice in the world a&s;&s;uredly te&s;tifies our pre&s;ent corruption; and according to the degree of its prevalence, is always, more or le&s;s, the &s;ource of mi&s;ery. It is a &s;tanding proof of the fall and degeneracy of man. But as long as that fallen &s;tate continues, the wi&s;dom of Providence eminently ap|pears in making the errors and frailties of the wick|ed &s;ub&s;ervient to the improvement of the ju&s;t. <HI>Tares</HI> are for that rea&s;on &s;uffered at pre&s;ent to grow up <HI>among the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations on the wi&s;dom of Providence in this di&s;pen&s;ation will be farther illu&s;trated, by con|&s;idering the u&s;eful in&s;tructions which we receive, or which at lea&s;t every wi&s;e man may receive, from the follies and vices of tho&s;e among whom we are obliged to live.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They furni&s;h in&s;truction concerning the &s;nares and dangers again&s;t which we ought to be mo&s;t on our guard. They put it thereby in our power to profit by the errors and mi&s;conduct of others. By ob&s;erving from what &s;mall beginnings the greate&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="028306_0045_0FD89512D3DBD108">crimes have ari&s;en; ob&s;erving how bad company has &s;educed this man from his original principles and ha|bits; how a carele&s;s indulgence of plea&s;ure has blind|ed and intoxicated that man; how the neglect of di|vine in&s;titutions has, in another, gradually paved the way for open profligacy; much &s;alutary in&s;truction is conveyed to the virtuous. Tracing the dangerous and &s;lippery paths by which &s;o many have been in&s;en&s;ibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etrayed into ruin, their views of human nature are enlarged; the &s;en&s;e of their own imbecility is &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed upon them; accompanied with the con|viction of the nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;tant dependence on the grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven. All the crimes which they behold di&s;turbing &s;ociety around them, &s;erve as &s;ignals hung out to them, beacons planted in their view, to prevent their making &s;hipwreck among tho&s;e rocks on which others have &s;plit. It has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that not only from the advices of his friends, but from the reproaches of his enemies, a wi&s;e man may draw in&s;truction. In the &s;ame man|ner, it is not only by the examples of good men, but likewi&s;e by tho&s;e of the wicked, that an attentive mind may be confirmed in virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Next.</HI> The&s;e examples of bad men, while they ad|moni&s;h the virtuous of the dangers again&s;t which they are to guard, are farther profitable by the views which they exhibit of the evil and the deformity of &s;in. Its odious nature never appears in &s;o &s;trong a light as when di&s;played in the crimes of the wicked. It is true that, when vice is carried to a certain de|gree, and di&s;gui&s;ed by plau&s;ible colours, it may pa&s;s unreproved, and even for a while &s;eem popular in the world. But it is no le&s;s true that, when it becomes open and flagrant, and is deprived of the &s;hadow of virtue, it never fails to in our general reproach, and to become the object either of contempt or of hatred.
<PB N="41" REF="028306_0046_0FD895140008F110">How often, for in&s;tance, have the abilities, which once drew e&s;teem and admiration, &s;unk, in a &s;hort time, into the mo&s;t humiliating degradation mere|ly through the a&s;cendant which corrupted inclinations and low habits had acquired over their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or? How often have the ri&s;ing honours of the young been bla&s;ted, by their for&s;aking the path of honour on which they had once entered, for the blind and crook|ed tracts of depravity and folly? Such &s;pectacles of the infamy of vice, &s;uch memerials of the di&s;grace at|tending it, are permitted by Providence for general in&s;truction and are a&s;&s;uredly edifying to the world. It was nece&s;&s;ary, for moral improvement, that the beau|ty and excellence of virtue, and the deformity of vice, &s;hould be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on every intelligent mind. This could never be done with &s;o great advantage as by the &s;triking contra&s;ts of both which are produced by the living examples of evil men intermixed with the good. It is in this mirror that we clearly contem|plate how much the <HI>righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame purpo&s;e of important in&s;truction is far|ther promoted by the in&s;tances of mi&s;ery which the &s;tate of wicked men on earth affords. I admit that the worldly &s;ucce&s;s, which &s;ometimes attends them, may blind and &s;educe the unwary; but a little more reffection enables men to di&s;tingui&s;h between appar|ent &s;ucce&s;s and real happine&s;s. The condition of worthle&s;s men, whatever &s;plendor riches may throw around them, is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned to be a re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable one; and the mi&s;ery which they &s;uffer, to be derived from their vices. In that great corrupted crowd which &s;urrounds us, what ince&s;tant bu&s;tle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ir, what agitation and tumults take place? What env<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and jealou&s;y of one another? How much hitterne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tment do we behold among them; mutually
<PB N="42" REF="028306_0047_0FD89515809093B8">deceiving and deceived; &s;upplanting and &s;upplanted; ever pur&s;uing, but never &s;atisfied? The&s;e are not mat|ters of rare ob&s;ervation, or which require nice &s;cru|tiny to di&s;cover them. We need only open our eyes to behold the wicked tormented by their pa&s;&s;ions, and far removed from that &s;anctuary of calmne&s;s and tran|quillity which is the abode of real happine&s;s. Nay, when we appeal to bad men them&s;elves, after they have run the whole round of vicious plea&s;ures, we will often find them obliged to confe&s;s, that the wretched re&s;ult of their pur&s;uits has been <HI>vanity and vexation of &s;pirit;</HI> and that the happie&s;t days they have enjoyed were in the times of innocence; before criminal de&s;ires and guilty pa&s;&s;ions had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their brea&s;ts. Such practical demon&s;trations as the&s;e of the infelicity of &s;in are yielded by the examples of evil doers whom we &s;ee around us. By attending to their &s;ituation, the mi&s;ery, as well as infamy of guilt is reali&s;ed, and rendered &s;en&s;ible to our appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, upon a fair inquiry, you behold how the ways of God may, in this remarkable ca&s;e, be ju&s;ti|fied to man. You behold what important ends are advanced, by permitting <HI>the tares</HI> at pre&s;ent to <HI>grow together with the wheat.</HI> The intermixture of evil men in human &s;ociety &s;erves to exerci&s;e the &s;uffering graces and virtues of the good; by the diver&s;ity of characters among tho&s;e with whom they have inter|cour&s;e, it &s;erves to bring forth and improve their ac|tive powers and virtues, and to enlarge the circle of u&s;eful occupations; it ferves to in&s;truct them in the temptations again&s;t which they are to guard, to reveal to them all the deformity of vice, and to make its mi&s;e|ries pa&s;s con&s;picuou&s;ly before their eyes. When we con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">der them as actors on the theatre of the world, they are thereby improved in the part they have to perform.
<PB N="43" REF="028306_0048_0FD89516FA505840">When we con&s;ider them as &s;pectators of what is pa&s;&s;|ing on that theatre, their minds are thereby in&s;truct|ed; their views rectified and enlarged by the objects that are &s;et before them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e important truths, &s;everal reflections no le&s;s important ari&s;e.</P>
<P>We are naturally taught, in the fir&s;t place, never to be ha&s;ty in finding fault with any of the arrangements of Providence. The pre&s;ent permi&s;&s;ion of moral evil on the earth &s;eemed, on the fir&s;t view, to furni&s;h a &s;trong objection again&s;t either the wi&s;dom or the goodne&s;s of the Author of nature. After beholding the u&s;eful purpo&s;es which are an&s;wered by that per|mi&s;&s;ion, how cautious &s;hould we be in advancing any of our ra&s;h &s;peculations again&s;t his government and conduct! To our confined and humble &s;tation it belongs not to cen&s;ure, but to &s;ubmit, tru&s;t, and adore; &s;atisfied that the farther we enquire, the rec|titude of his ways will appear the more; thankful for the di&s;coveries of them which have been imparted to us; and per&s;uaded that, where our di&s;coveries fail, it is not becau&s;e there is no more wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s to be &s;een, but becau&s;e our pre&s;ent condition allows us not to &s;ee more.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, let us be taught with what eye we are to look upon tho&s;e bad men whom we find around us in the world. Not &s;urely with an eye of envy. Whatever pro&s;perity they may &s;eem to enjoy, they are &s;till no more than <HI>tares,</HI> the weeds of the field; contemptible in the &s;ight of God; tolerated by his providence for a while on account of the right|eous, to who&s;e improvement they are rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient. The parable informs us that, in the end, they are to be <HI>gathered and burnt.</HI> In this life only they have <HI>their good things.</HI> But their pro&s;perity is tran&s;itory. <HI>They are brought into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;olation in a moment,
<PB N="44" REF="028306_0049_0FD8951889BC08F0">and utterly con&s;umed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh, &s;o, O God, when thou awake&s;t, thou &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt de&s;pi&s;e their image</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm Ixxiii. 19.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.&mdash; When we con&s;ider their un|happy &s;tate, it becomes us to behold them with the eye of pity. Let us remember that, in the mid&s;t of their errors, they are by nature &s;till our brethren. Let us not behave to them in the &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s. In|&s;ult not their follies. Pride not your&s;elves on &s;uperior virtue. Remember that, as bad men are mixed with the good, &s;o, in the be&s;t men, vices are at pre&s;ent mixed with virtues. Your own character, good as you may e&s;teem it, is not free from every evil taint; and in the characters of tho&s;e whom you reprobate as vitious, there are always &s;ome good qualities mix|ed with the bad ones. Study, as far as you can, to reclaim and amend them; and if, in any degree, you have been profited by their failings, endeavour, in return, to profit them, by good coun&s;el and advice, by advice, not admini&s;tered with officious zeal, or &s;elf-conceited &s;uperiority, but with the tenderne&s;s of compa&s;&s;ion and real friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the third place, in whatever proportion the ad|mixture of vice may &s;eem to take place in the world, let us never de&s;pair of the prevalence of virtue on the whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond mea&s;ure, the quantity of vice that is found in the mixture. It is proper to ob&s;erve, that in the parable now before us, af|ter the owner of the field had <HI>&s;own his good &s;eed,</HI> no rea|&s;on is given us to think, that the good &s;eed was en|tirely chocked up by <HI>tares.</HI> On the contrary, we are told that <HI>the blade &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit;</HI> and, though the <HI>tares</HI> al&s;o aro&s;e, yet, in the end there was a <HI>harve&s;t,</HI> when the <HI>wheat was reaped and gathered into the barn.</HI> In the mo&s;t corrupted times, God never leaves

Though the <HI>tares</HI> mu&s;t be at all times &s;pringing up, there is no rea&s;on for be|lieving that they &s;hall ever over&s;pread the whole field. The nature of the weeds that &s;pring up may vary, ac|cording to the nature of the &s;oil. Different modes of iniquity may di&s;tingui&s;h different ages of the world; while the &s;um of corruption is nearly the &s;ame. Let not our judgments of men, and of the times in which we live, be ha&s;ty and pre&s;umptuous. Let us tru&s;t in the grace of God; and hope the be&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>In the fourth and la&s;t place, let us keep our eyes ever fixed on that important period, which is alluded to in the text, as the conclu&s;ion of all. <HI>Let both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI> The great &s;piritual year is to be clo&s;ed by <HI>a harve&s;t,</HI> when <HI>the hou&s;eholder is to ga|ther the wheat into his barn;</HI> when, at the end of the world, the final di&s;tinction of men and characters is to take place. The confu&s;ed mixture of good and evil, which now prevails, is only a temporary di&s;|pen&s;ation of Providence, accommodated to man's fal|len and imperfect &s;tate. Let it not tempt us for a moment to di&s;tru&s;t the reality of the divine govern|ment; or to entertain the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion that mor|al

<P>THE life of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n earth is doomed to be cloud|ed with various evils.

The Chri&s;|tian religion is particularly entitled to our regard, by accommodating it&s;elf with great tenderne&s;s to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of mankind. It is not to be con|&s;idered as merely an au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oritative &s;y&s;tem of precepts.

This amiable and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eli|gion con&s;picou&s;ly appears in the character of its great Author. It &s;hone in all his actions while he lived on earth. It breathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all his di&s;cour&s;es; and, in the words of the text, is expre&s;&s;ed with much energy. In the preceding ver&s;e, he had given a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh account of his own per&s;on and dignity. <HI>All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will reveal him.</HI> But lea&s;t any of his hearers &s;hould be di&s;cour|aged by this my&s;terious repre&s;entation of his greatne&s;s, he in&s;tantly tempers it with the mo&s;t gracious be|nignity; declaring, in the text, the merciful inten|tion of his mi&s;&s;ion to the world, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which claims our attention in the&s;e words is, what we are to under&s;tand by <HI>coming unto Chri&s;t.</HI> This is a phra&s;e which has often given oc|ca&s;ion to controver&s;ey. By theological writers it has been involved in much needle&s;s my&s;tery, while the meaning in it&s;elf is plain and ea&s;y. The very me|taphor that is here u&s;ed &s;erves to explain it. In the ancient world, di&s;ciples flocked round their different teachers, and attended them wherever they went; in order both to te&s;tify their attachment, and to imbibe more fully the doctrine of their ma&s;ters. <HI>Coming unto Chri&s;t,</HI> therefore, is the &s;ame with re&s;orting to him as our declared Ma&s;ter? acknowledging our&s;elves his di&s;ciples, believers in his doctrine, and followers of his precepts. As Chri&s;t is made known to us un|der the character both of a Teacher and a Saviour, our <HI>coming to him</HI> imports not only &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his in&s;tructions, but confidence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his power to &s;ave. It imports that, for&s;aking the corruptions of &s;in and the world, we follow that cour&s;e of virtue and obedi|ence
<PB N="49" REF="028306_0054_0FD895217A3108A0">which he points out to us; relying on his med|iation for pardon of our offences, and acceptance w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h heaven. This is what is implied in the &s;cripture term <HI>Faith;</HI> which includes both the a&s;&s;ent of the under|&s;tanding to the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, and the concurrence of the will in receiving it.</P>
<P>What next occurs in the text to attract our notice is the de&s;cription of tho&s;e to whom the invitation is addre&s;&s;ed. All tho&s;e who <HI>labour and are heavy laden,</HI> that is, who, in one way or other, feel them&s;elves grieved and dutre&s;&s;ed, are here invited to come to Chri&s;t.&mdash;Now, from two &s;ources chiefly our di&s;tre&s;&s;|es ari&s;e; from moral, or from natural cau&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They may ari&s;e from inward moral cau&s;es; from certain feelings and reflections of the mind, which occa&s;ion unea&s;ine&s;s and pain. A cour&s;e of &s;in and vice always proves ruinous and de&s;tructive in the i&s;&s;ue. But its tendency to ruin is often not perceiv|ed, while that tendency is advancing. For as &s;in is the reign of pa&s;&s;ion and plea&s;ure, it forms men to a thoughtle&s;s incon&s;iderate &s;tate. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cum&s;tances, how|ever, may occur, and frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, in the cour&s;e of life, do occur, which di&s;clo&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vicious man the ruin which he is bringing on him&s;elf, as an offender again&s;t the God who made him.

He con&s;iders that he is undoubtedly placed under the government of a ju&s;t God, who did not &s;end him into this world for
<PB N="50" REF="028306_0055_0FD89522FA275058">nought; that he has neglected the part a&s;&s;igned to him; has contemned the laws of heaven; has de|graded his own nature; and in&s;tead of being u&s;eful, having been hurtful and pernicious to tho&s;e among whom he lived, is about to leave a dete&s;table memo|ry behind him.&mdash;What account &s;hall he give of him|&s;elf to his Maker; Self condemned, polluted by &s;o many crimes, how can he expect to find mercy in his &s;ight; Hence, an overwhelmed and dejected mind; hence, di&s;mal forebodings of puni&s;hment; hence, that <HI>wounded &s;pirit,</HI> which, when it is deeply pierced, becomes the fore&s;t of all human evils, and has &s;ome|times rendered exi&s;tence a burden which could not be endured.</P>
<P>Such di&s;tre&s;&s;es as the&s;e, ari&s;ing from moral internal cau&s;es, may be made light of by the giddy and the vain; and repre&s;ented as confined to a few per&s;ons only of di&s;tempered imagination. But to tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions give them occa&s;ion to &s;ee men under vari|ous circum&s;tances of affliction, they are known to be far from being unfrequent in the world; and on many more occa&s;ions than is commonly imagined, to throw over the human mind the blacke&s;t gloom of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. Religious feelings, be a&s;&s;ured, have a deep root in the nature of man. They form a part of the human con&s;titution. They are interwoven with many of tho&s;e fears and hopes which actuates us in the changing &s;ituations of fortune. During the gay and active periods of life, they may be &s;mothered; but with mo&s;t men, they are &s;mothered rather than totally obliterated: And if any cri&s;is of our condition &s;hall awaken, and bring them forth, in their full force upon a con&s;cious guilty heart, woe to the man, who, in &s;ome di&s;con&s;olate &s;ea&s;on, is doomed to &s;uffer their extreme vengeance!</P>
<P>But, while under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the mind not

The life of man is not indeed wholly compo&s;ed of mi&s;ery. It admits of many, plea&s;ing &s;cenes. On the whole, there is rea&s;on to believe that it affords more joy than grief. At the &s;ame time, the unfortunate, as I before ob&s;er|ved, form always a numerous cla&s;s of mankind; and it may be &s;aid with truth, that <HI>&s;ore travel is ordained for the &s;ons of men.</HI> Though the burden is not equally laid on all; &s;ome there always are, on whom it falls with oppre&s;&s;ive weight.&mdash;Unexpected di&s;appoint|ments have cru&s;hed their hopes, and bla&s;ted the plans which they had formed for comfort in the world. The world had, perhaps, &s;miled upon them once, only to give them a feeling of its mi&s;eries at the la&s;t. Struggling with poverty, unable to &s;upport their fam|ilies whom they &s;ee langui&s;hing around them, they, at the &s;ame time, are obliged by their &s;ituation in &s;o ciety to conceal their nece&s;&s;ities; and under the for|ced appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ance of cheerfulne&s;s, to hide from the world a broken heart.

<P>When we turn to tho&s;e who are accounted pro&s;per|ous men, we &s;hall always find many &s;orrows mingled with their plea&s;ures; many hours of care and vexa|tion, wherein they acknowledge them&s;elves cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e who <HI>labour and are heavy laden.</HI> In en|tering

<P>To the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of mankind is addre&s;&s;ed the invi|tation of the text. To them, it is in a particular manner addre&s;&s;ed; overlooking the giddy and di&s;&s;i|pated multitude. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</HI> Not as if our Saviour were always ready to accept that &s;ort of piety which is merely the con&s;equence of di&s;tre&s;s; or made all tho&s;e welcome, who are driven by nothing but fear or danger to have recour&s;e to him. His words are to be under&s;tood as intimating, that the heart which is humbled and &s;oft|ened by affliction, is the object of his compa&s;&s;ionate regard; that he will not reject us merely becau&s;e we have been ca&s;t off by the world; but that, if with proper di&s;po&s;itions and &s;entiments we apply to him in the evil day, we &s;hall be &s;ure of meeting with a graci|ous reception. It now remains to &s;how, what that re|ception is which we may look for; what that re&s;t is which Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed to confer on tho&s;e who <HI>come to him;</HI> whether their di&s;tre&s;&s;es ari&s;e from moral or natural cau&s;es. <HI>Come unto me, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI></P>

1. Chri&s;t affords re&s;t to the di&s;turbed mind that la|bours under apprehen&s;ions and fears of guilt. Let tho&s;e who &s;uffer di&s;tre&s;s of this nature <HI>come to Chri&s;t,</HI> that is, with contrition and repentance, have recour&s;e to him as their Saviour, and they &s;hall regain quietne&s;s and peace. Fooli&s;h and guilty they have been; and ju&s;tly lie under dread of puni&s;hment; but the peni|tent &s;orrow which they now feel, implies their di&s;po|&s;ition to be changed.

In this &s;ituation of mind, let them not be ca&s;t down and de&s;pair. Chri&s;t has brought with him from heaven the olive branch. He carries in his hand the &s;ignal of forgivene&s;s.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It in&s;pires fortitude.

From the ab&s;tract con&s;ideration of the divine perfections, men had always &s;ome ground to believe, that the general order of the univer&s;e was con&s;ulted by its great Ruler. But how far the intere&s;t of individuals might be ob|liged to yield, or, in many ca&s;es might be &s;acrificed, to this general order, they were left altogether in the dark. Here the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t comes to our aid, by the explicit a&s;&s;urance which it gives, that, in the great &s;y&s;tem of Providence, the welfare of every &s;in|gle good man is particularly included. <HI>All things,</HI> we are expre&s;sly told, are made to <HI>work together,</HI> not merely for the order and perfection of the whole, but al&s;o <HI>for good to them who love God.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom viii 28</NOTE> The life of eve|ry

<P>The doctrine of Chri&s;t not only arms us, in this manner, with fortitude again&s;t the approach of evil; but, &s;uppo&s;ing evils to fall upon us with their heav|ie&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, it lightens the load by many con&s;olations to which others are &s;trangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are vi&s;ited, the hand of an offended &s;overeign, Chri&s;tians are taught to view
<PB N="57" REF="028306_0062_0FD8952D8DAB09E8">them as the well-intended cha&s;ti&s;ements of a merci|ful Father.

In tho&s;e moments of devotion, a pious man, pour|ing out his wants and &s;orrows to an almighty Sup|porter, feels that he is not left &s;olitary and for&s;aken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Chri&s;t and the Holy Gho&s;t are with him; and, though he &s;hould be bereaved of every earthly friend, he can look up in heaven to a Friend who will never die.</P>
<P>To the&s;e pre&s;ent con&s;olations, the religion of Chri&s;t adds the joyful pro&s;pect of that future &s;tate, where eternal <HI>re&s;t remaineth for the people of God.</HI> This life they are taught to con&s;ider as only the <HI>hou&s;e of their pilgrimage;</HI> the temporary man&s;ion of painful though nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline. But let them endure for a little and the pilgrimage &s;hall end, the di&s;cipline &s;hall be fini&s;hed; and all the virtuous be a&s;&s;embled in tho&s;e bli&s;sful regions which are prepared for their reward. Such a pro&s;pect cheers the darke&s;t hours of life;
<PB N="58" REF="028306_0063_0FD8952EFB072CF0">and affords a remedy to every trouble. <HI>The &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which &s;hall be revealed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 18.</NOTE> They appear in this comparative view, as no more than a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dream of the night, from which one awakes into health, and light, and joy.&mdash;Peculiar is this high con&s;olation to the religion of Chri&s;t. It is what all nations had ea|gerly wi&s;hed for; what all philo&s;ophy had anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to di&s;cover; but what no re&s;earch, no philo|&s;ophy were able to a&s;certain to mankind, till Chri&s;t brought the a&s;&s;urance of life and immortality from heaven; and conferred on his di&s;ciples this noble and ine&s;timable gift.</P>
<P>Thus, on the whole, the Chri&s;tain doctrine is found to be the great Medicine of life. It is the balm of human &s;orrows and cares. In our pre&s;ent &s;tate, where &s;o many are &s;uffering actual di&s;tre&s;s, of one kind or other, and where all have rea&s;on to dread the approach of di&s;tre&s;s, it is religion only that can alleviate the burdens of life, and &s;mooth our pa&s;&s;age through this evil world.&mdash;Let this view of religion per&s;uade us to improve the &s;acred ordinance of our Lord's &s;upper for <HI>coming unto Chri&s;t,</HI> in the way before explained: that is, joining our&s;elves to him as his di&s;ciples; his di&s;ciples, not in words and profe&s;&s;ions only, but in heart, and in truth; <HI>taking upon us his yoke,</HI> as is ad|ded in the words immediately following the text; <HI>and learning of him who is meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Let tho&s;e who labour under the &s;en&s;e of remembred follies and crimes, <HI>come unto Chri&s;t</HI> with penitent di&s;po&s;itions, and they &s;hall obtain pardon. Let tho&s;e who labour under the &s;uffering of pre&s;ent, or the apprehen&s;ion of future &s;orrows, <HI>come unto Chri&s;t,</HI> and they &s;hall re|ceive con&s;olation.

<P>Before concluding this di&s;cour&s;e, there is another &s;et of men, not yet mentioned, to whom I mu&s;t al&s;o addre&s;s the exhortation in the text; tho&s;e I mean, who labouring under none of the di&s;tre&s;sful burdens of life are &s;urfeited of its plea&s;ures; who labour under the burden only of languid ea&s;e, and the load of in&s;ipid pro&s;perity. You drag, my friends, but a mi&s;earble exi&s;tence. Oppre&s;&s;ed by no &s;orrow, you feel vacuity and di&s;&s;atisfaction within; you are often weary of life; and in your &s;olitary hours, are di&s;po&s;ed to con|fe&s;s that all you have experienced is vanity. Where|fore &s;hould you any longer <HI>&s;pend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which &s;ati&s;|fieth not? Come to the waters which are now offered to you, and drink.

A world yet untried &s;hall di&s;play it&s;elf to your view. You &s;hall be formed to a reli&s;h for the quiet and innocent plea&s;ures of piety and devotion; of friend&s;hip, and good affec|tions; of u&s;eful knowledge, and virtuous activity; of calm &s;ociety, and &s;ea&s;onable retirement; plea&s;ures of which at pre&s;ent you have no conception; but which, upon trial. you &s;hall find &s;uperior to the tri|fling, or turbulent amu&s;ements, in which you have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed your days.&mdash;The true &s;atisfaction of the human mind is only to be found in religion and goodne&s;s; in a purified heart, and a virtuous life.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH V. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe and wine are in their fea&s;ts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither con&s;ider the operation of his hands.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from many pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of this prophet, that in his days great corruption of man|ners had begun to take place among the people of I&s;|rael. Originally a &s;ober and a religious nation, ac|cu&s;tomed to a &s;imple and pa&s;toral life, after they had enlarged their territories by conque&s;t, and acquired wealth by commerce, they gradually contracted habits of luxury; and luxury &s;oon introduced its u&s;ual train of attending evils. In the hi&s;tory of all nations, the &s;ame circulation of manners has been found; and the age in which we live re&s;embles, in this re&s;pect, the ages which have gone before it. Forms of iniquity may vary; but the corrupt propen&s;ities of men re|main at all times much the &s;ame; and revolutions from primitive &s;implicity to the refinements of crimi|nal luxury have been often exhibited on the &s;tage of the world. The reproof directed in the text to the Jews of that antient age, will be found equally appli|cable to the manners of many, in modern times. In di&s;cour&s;ing from it, I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the charac|ter
<PB N="61" REF="028306_0066_0FD895343AC86E70">of tho&s;e who are de&s;cribed in the text, and &s;how the guilt that is involved in it. I &s;hall next con&s;ider the duties which per&s;ons of that character are &s;uppo&s;ed to have neglected; to <HI>regard the work of the Lord, and to con&s;ider the operation of his hands.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. When we take into view the character pointed at in the text, it is evident that what the prophet means to reprove is, the &s;pirit of incon&s;iderate di&s;|&s;ipation of intemperate indulgence, and irreligious luxury. It is not <HI>the fea&s;t and the wine, the harp and the viol,</HI> which he means to condemn. Mu&s;ic and wine are, in them&s;elves, things of innocent nature: Nay, when temperately enjoyed, they may be em|ployed for u&s;eful purpo&s;es; for affording relaxation from the oppre&s;&s;ive cares of life, and for promoting friendly intercour&s;e among men. The opulent are not prohibited from enjoying the good things of this world, which Providence has be&s;towed upon them. Religion neither aboli&s;hes the di&s;tinction of ranks, (as the vain philo&s;ophy of &s;ome would teach us to do,) nor interferes with a mode&s;t and decent indulgence of plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is the criminal abu&s;e of plea&s;ure which is here cen&s;ured; that thoughtle&s;s and intemperate enjoyment of it which wholly ab&s;orbs the time and attention of men; which obliterates every &s;erious thought of the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of life; and effaces the &s;en&s;e of religion and of God.</P>
<P>It may be proper to remark, that it is not open and direct impiety, which is laid to the charge of the per|&s;ons here characteri&s;ed. It is not &s;aid, that in their fea&s;ts they &s;coffed at religion, or bla&s;phemed the name of God. To this &s;ummit of wickedne&s;s the&s;e per&s;ons had not yet arrived; perhaps, the age in which they lived gave not its countenance to this wantonne&s;s of impiety. It is merely a negative crime of which they are accu&s;ed; that they <HI>regarded not the work of the
<PB N="62" REF="028306_0067_0FD8953680937218">Lord, neither con&s;idered the operation of his hands.</HI> But this ab&s;ence of all religious impre&s;&s;ions is here pointed out, as &s;ufficient to &s;tigmatize their characters with guilt. As &s;oon as the &s;en&s;e of a Supreme Being is lo&s;t, the great check is taken off, which keeps un|der re&s;traint the pa&s;&s;ions of men. Mean de&s;ires, and low plea&s;ures, take place of the greater and nobler &s;en|timents which rea&s;on and religion in&s;pire. Amid&s;t the tumult of <HI>the wine and the fea&s;t,</HI> all proper views of human life are forgotten. The duties which, as men, they have to perform, the part they have to act in the world, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which they are expo&s;ing them&s;elves, are bani&s;hed from their thoughts. <HI>To-morrow &s;hall be as this day, and more abundantly,</HI> is the only voice Inflamed by &s;ociety, and circula|ted from one loo&s;e companion to another, the &s;pirit of riot grows and &s;wells, till it end in brutal ex|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch di&s;orders rare and occa&s;ional merely, they might perhaps be forgotten and forgiven. But, nouri&s;hed by repetition and habit, they grow up among too many, to become the bu&s;ine&s;s and occupa|tion of life. By the&s;e unfortunate votaries of plea&s;ure, they are accounted e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s, life appears to &s;tagnate without them. Having no re&s;ource within them&s;elves, their &s;pirits &s;ink, and their very being &s;eems annihilated, till the return of their favourite plea&s;ures awaken within them &s;ome tran&s;ient &s;parkles of joy. &mdash;Idlene&s;s, ea&s;e, and pro&s;perity, have too natural a tendency to generate the follies and vices now de&s;crib|ed. <HI>Becau&s;e they have no changes,</HI> &s;aid the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>therefore they fear not God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lv. 19.</NOTE> They are the dark and &s;olitary hours of life, which recal men to recollection and wi&s;dom. They &s;how to the unthinking what
<PB N="63" REF="028306_0068_0FD8953846200DE0">this world really is, and what may be expected from it. But the day that is always bright and unclouded, is not made for men. It flatters them with the dan|gerous illu&s;ion, that it is in their power to render life one &s;cene of plea&s;ure; and that they have no other bu&s;ine&s;s on earth but to &s;pread the <HI>fea&s;t,</HI> and call <HI>the harp and the viol</HI> to &s;ound. But the examples are &s;o frequent, of the dangers and the crimes which ari&s;e from an intemperate abure of plea&s;ure, that on this part of the &s;ubject it &s;eems needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t any lon|ger. I proceed, therefore.</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the duties which men are accu&s;ed of having neglected; and which, it is here &s;uppo&s;ed, if duly attended to, would have acted as the correc|tives of di&s;&s;olute and irreligious luxury; tho&s;e are, to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider the operation of his hands.</HI>&mdash;By recommending &s;uch duties. I do not mean to repre&s;ent it as requi&s;ite that the fea&s;t &s;hould be turned into an act of wor&s;hip? that the counte|nances of men &s;hould be always grave; or that, in the hours of amu&s;ement and of &s;ocial fe&s;tivity, no &s;ub|ject may employ their thoughts and their di&s;cour&s;e, except God and a future &s;tate. All extremes in reli|gion are dangerous; and, by carrying au&s;terity too far, we are in hazard of only promoting hypocri&s;y. But though &s;ome, in the la&s;t age, might be prone to this extreme; yet, at the pre&s;ent day, there is not much occa&s;ion for warning men again&s;t it.&mdash;What I now in&s;i&s;t upon is, that all our plea&s;ures ought to be tempered with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of God; that &s;cenes of gaiety and enjoyment &s;hould never make us forget that we are &s;ubjects of his government, and have a part allotted us to act in his world; that on no occa|&s;ion they &s;hould be prolonged &s;o much, repeated &s;o often, or &s;uffered to tran&s;port us &s;o far, as to lead us to break any of the divine laws, or to act incon&s;i&s;t|ently
<PB N="64" REF="028306_0069_0FD8953AFB60AF00">with the character of men and Chri&s;tians. A prevailing &s;en&s;e of God on the mind is to be ever hold the &s;ure&s;t guard of innocence and virtue, amid&s;t the allurements of plea&s;ure. It is the &s;alutary mix|ture which mu&s;t be infu&s;&s;ed into the cup of joy, in or|der to render it &s;afe and innoxious.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of God &s;hould lead us, in the language of the prophet, to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider the operation of his hands;</HI> which expre&s;&s;ions may be under&s;tood as requiring us to have God up|on our thoughts under two views: <HI>to regard his work,</HI> as the Author of nature; and <HI>to con&s;ider the operation of his hands,</HI> as the Governor of the world. Let us at|tend more particularly to each of the&s;e views of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, we are to view God as the Author of nature, <HI>or to regard the work of the Lord.</HI> With his works we are in every place &s;urrounded. We can ca&s;t our eyes no where, without di&s;cerning the hand of Him who formed them, if the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of our minds will only allow us to behold Him. Let giddy and thoughtle&s;s men turn a&s;ide a little from the haunts of riot. Let them &s;tand &s;till, and contem|plate the wondrous works of God; and make trial of the effect which &s;uch contemplation would pro|duce. &mdash;It were good for them that, even independ|ently of the Author, they were more acquainted with his works; good for them, that from the &s;ocieties of loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute men, they would retreat to the &s;cenes of nature; would oftener dwell among them, and enjoy their beauties. This would form them to the reli&s;h of uncorrupted, innocent plea&s;ures; and make them feel the va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue of calm enjoyments, as &s;u|perior to the noi&s;e and turbulence of licen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious gaiety. From the harmony of nature, and of nature's works, they would learn to hear &s;weeter &s;ounds than what ari&s;es from <HI>the viol, the tabret, and the pipe.</HI></P>

But to higher and more &s;erious thoughts the&s;e works of nature give occa&s;ion, when con&s;idered in conjunc|tion with the Creator who made them.&mdash;Let me call on you, my friends, to catch &s;ome interval of reflec|tion, &s;ome &s;erious moment, for looking with thought|ful eye on the world around you. Lift your view to that immen&s;e arch of heaven which encompa&s;&s;es you above.

Contemplate a &s;teady and powerful Hand, bringing round &s;pring and &s;ummer, autumn and winter, in regular cour&s;e; decorating this earth with innumerable beauties, diver&s;ifying it with in|numerable inhabitants; pouring forth comforts on all that live; and, at the &s;ame time, overawing the nations with the violence of the elements, when it plea&s;es the Creator to let them forth.&mdash;After you have viewed your&s;elves as &s;urrounded with &s;uch a &s;cene of wonders; after you have beheld on every hand, &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;play of maje&s;ty united with wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; are you not &s;eized with &s;olemn and &s;erious awe?

Did you not hear an inward voice upbraiding you for having &s;unk and degraded your character &s;o far below that of many of your equals around you?&mdash;My friends, what was this but the voice of God, &s;peaking, as the Govenor of his creatures, within your heart; te&s;tifying loudly that your cour&s;e of life was di&s;plea&s;ing to him; and war|ning you of puni&s;hments that were to follow? If his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t you is already begun to be te&s;tified, can you tell where it is to &s;top, or how long it may continue to pur&s;ue you throughout future &s;tages of your exi&s;tence? <HI>Who knoweth the power of his wrath?</HI> &mdash;To this awful, this warring voice, will you not be per&s;uaded reverently to li&s;ten! Impre&s;&s;ed by the dread authority which it carries, &s;hall you not fall down on your knees before your Maker, imploring his mer|cy to pardon your pa&s;t offences, and his grace to rect|ify your future way?</P>
<P>Such ought to be the effects of the con&s;ideration of God as the Governor of the world. It leads to thoughts of a very &s;erious nature. When we <HI>regard
<PB N="70" REF="028306_0075_0FD87F3EDEF5D3B8">the work of the Lord,</HI> and contemplate him as the Au|thor of the univer&s;e, &s;uch contemplation prompts de|votion. But when we <HI>con&s;ider the operation of his hands</HI> in providence, and contemplate him as the Govenor of mankind, &s;uch contemplation prompts humiliation before him for offences committed. The former ad|dre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to the ingenuous &s;entiments that are left in the heart; and awakens a &s;en&s;e of our unworthi|ne&s;s, in neglecting the Author of nature, amid&s;t our riotous plea&s;ures. The latter addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to our regard for &s;afety and happine&s;s; and awakens fear and dread, from conciou&s;ne&s;s of the guilt we have con|tracted. Hence &s;prings up in every thoughtful mind an anxious concern to avert the di&s;plea&s;ure, and re|gain the favour of that Supreme Being to whom we are all &s;ubject. This, among unenlightened nations, gave ri&s;e to &s;acrifices, expiations, and all the rites of hum|ble, though &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip. Among nations who have been in&s;tructed in true religion, &s;entiments of the &s;ame nature pave the way for prayer, repen|tance, faith, and all tho&s;e duties, by means of which we may hope, through a divine Mediator and inter|ce&s;&s;or, to be reconciled to heaven. Natural and re|vealed religion here appear in concord. We behold the original dictates of the human heart laying a foundation for the glad reception of the comfortable tidings of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I have thus endeavoured to &s;how in what manner, by <HI>regarding the work of the Lord, and con&s;idering the operation of his hands,</HI> we may prevent the dangers ari&s;|ing from a thoughtle&s;s indulgence of plea&s;ure; we may be furni&s;hed with an antidote to the poi&s;on which is too often mixed in that intoxicating cup.&mdash;Human life is full of troubles. We are all tempted to allevi|ate them as much as we can, by freely enjoying the plea&s;urable moments which Providence thinks fit to
<PB N="71" REF="028306_0076_0FD89540FA1120A8">allow us. Enjoy them we may: But, if we would enjoy them &s;afely, and enjoy them long, let us tem|per them with the fear of God. As &s;oon as this is forgotten and obliterated, the &s;ound of <HI>the harp and the viol</HI> is changed into the &s;ignal of death. The &s;er|pent comes forth from the ro&s;es where it had lain in ambu&s;h, and gives the fatal &s;ting. Plea&s;ure in mo|deration is the cordial, in exce&s;s it is the bane, of life.</P>

But though the <HI>Sun of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was not ari&s;en, the dawn had appeared of that glorious day which he was to introduce. Even in tho&s;e antient times, holy men, as the apo&s;tle writes to the Hebrews, <HI>&s;aw the promi&s;es afar off, and were per&s;uad|ed of them and embraced them; and confe&s;&s;ing that they were &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, declared that they &s;aught after a better country, that is an heavenly.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi 13, 16.</NOTE> Indeed in every age, God permitted &s;uch hopes to afford &s;upport and con&s;olation to tho&s;e who &s;erved him. The full effect of them we behold in tho&s;e triumphant expre&s;&s;ions of the text, which are to be the &s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e. They lead us to con&s;ider; fir&s;t, The hope of the P&s;almi&s;t in his pre&s;ent &s;tate; <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life.</HI> And, &s;econdly, the termi|nation of his hope in that future &s;tate, where <HI>in the pre|&s;ence of God is fulne&s;s of joy, and at his right hand there are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life.</HI> This plainly imports that there are different <HI>paths</HI> or cour&s;es of con|duct, which may be pur&s;ued by men in this world; a path which leads to life or happine&s;s, and a path which i&s;&s;ues in death or de&s;truction. The&s;e oppo&s;ite lines of conduct are determined by the choice which men make of virtue or of vice; and hence men are divided into two great cla&s;&s;es, according as their in|clinations lead them to good or to evil. <HI>The path of life</HI> is often a rough and difficult path, followed only by a few. The oppo&s;ite one is the broad way, in which the multitude walk; &s;eemingly &s;mooth, and
<PB N="73" REF="028306_0078_0FD89544BB4683C8">&s;trewed with flowers; but leading in the end to death and mi&s;ery. <HI>The path of life</HI> conducts us up a &s;teep a&s;cent. The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repre&s;ented as placed on the &s;ummit of a hill; in the a&s;cent of which labour is requi&s;ite, and difficulties are to be &s;urmounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our &s;teps.</P>
<P>Now, the hope which good men entertain is, that this <HI>path of life</HI> &s;hall be &s;hewn them by God; that, when their intentions are upright, God will both in|&s;truct them concerning the road which leads to true happine&s;s, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t them to pur&s;ue it &s;ucce&s;sful|ly. Among nations where any &s;uitable ideas of God or of virtue began to be formed, hopes of this nature al&s;o began to be entertained. It was con&s;onant to the nature of man, to think that the Supreme Being was favourable to virtue. Accordingly, in the writings of &s;ome of the ancient philo&s;ophers, we find various ob&s;cure traces of this belief, that there was a benign heavenly &s;pirit, who illuminated the minds of the vir|tuous, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted their endeavours to obtain wi&s;dom and happine&s;s. They even a&s;&s;erted, that no man be|came great or good without &s;ome in&s;piration of hea|ven.</P>
<P>But what they indi&s;tinctly conceived, and could not with confidence rely upon, the doctrine of Chri&s;ti|anity hath clearly explained and fully confirmed; expre&s;sly and frequently teaching that, not only by the external di&s;coveries of revelation, but by the in|ward operations of his Spirit, he <HI>&s;hows</HI> to the humble and virtuous the <HI>path of life.</HI> While, by his word, he in&s;tructs them in their duty, by the influence of his grace he a&s;&s;i&s;ts them in the performance of it. In all revelation there is certainly no doctrine more comfortable than this. It is to good men a noble and plea&s;ing thought, that they are pur&s;uing a path which
<PB N="74" REF="028306_0079_0FD89547002BB768">God has di&s;covered and pointed out to them.

In this &s;ituation, can they ever &s;u&s;pect that the Father of mercies will leave his &s;ervants, alone and unbefriended, to &s;truggle up the hill of virtue, without &s;tretching forth a compa&s;&s;ion|ate arm to aid their frailty, and to guide them through the bewild<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring paths of life?

But when they are con&s;idered in counection with a revelation, which, upon grounds the mo&s;t unque&s;tion|able, we believe to be divine, they are entitled to com|mand, not attention only, but reverence and faith.&mdash;They pre&s;ent to us &s;uch high expectations are are &s;uf|ficient to determine every rea&s;onable man to the choice of virtue to &s;upport him under all its pre&s;ent di&s;cour|agements, and to comfort him in the hour of death. Ju&s;tly may they excite in our hearts that ardent a&s;pi|ration of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth for God for the living God; O when &s;hall I come and appear before him</HI>&mdash;But, with this wi&s;h in our hearts, never I be&s;eech you, let us forget what was &s;et forth in the

<P>THESE words occurred in a conference which our Lord held with Simon Peter, after his re&s;urrection from the dead. Con&s;cious of the di&s;|grace which he had incurred by his late denial of his
<PB N="83" REF="028306_0088_0FD895547B713D48">Ma&s;ter, Peter mu&s;t at this time have appeared before him with &s;hame. Our Lord, after a tacit rebuke, implied in the que&s;tion which the repeatedly puts to him, <HI>Simon &s;on of Jonas, love&s;t thou me?</HI> re&s;tores him, with great benignity, to his office as an apo&s;tle, by giving the commandment to <HI>feed his &s;heep;</HI> and intimates al&s;o that it &s;hould be his lot to &s;uffer death in the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter. The apo&s;tle John, di&s;|tingui&s;hed here by the denomination of <HI>the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved,</HI> being pre&s;ent at this conver&s;ation, Peter, who was always eager and forward, looking to John, puts this que&s;tion to our Saviour, <HI>Lord, and what &s;hall this man do?</HI> <Q>What &s;hall be his em|ployment? what his rank and &s;tation in thy king|dom? what his future fate in life?</Q>&mdash;By what prin|ciple Peter was moved to put this un&s;ea&s;onable and improper que&s;tion to his Ma&s;ter; whether it aro&s;e from mere curio&s;ity, of from &s;ome emotion of rival|&s;hip and jealou&s;y, does not appear; but it is plain that our Lord was di&s;&s;atisfied with the inquiry which he made; and pre&s;ently he checks Peter's curio&s;ity, by a &s;evere reply; <HI>What is that to thee?</HI> <Q>What is it to thee what <HI>this man &s;hall do;</HI> what &s;hall be his rank; or what the circum&s;tances of his life or his death?

That idle curio&s;ity, that inqui&s;itive and meddling &s;pirit, which leads men to pry into the affairs of their neighbours, is reprehen&s;ible on three accounts. It interrupts the good order, and breakes the peace of &s;o|ciety. It brings forward and nouri&s;hes &s;everal bad pa&s;&s;ions. It draws men a&s;ide from a proper attention to the di&s;charge of their own duty.</P>
<P>It interrupts, I &s;ay, the order, and breaks the peace of &s;ociety. In this world we are linked together by many ties We are bound by duty, and we are prompt|ed by intere&s;t, to give mutal a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to per|form friendly offices to each other. But tho&s;e friend|ly offices are performed to mo&s;t advantage, when we avoid to interfere unnece&s;&s;arily in the concerns of our neighbour. Every man has his own part to act, has his own intere&s;t to con&s;ult, has affairs of his own to manage, which his neighbour has no call to &s;crutin|ize. Human life then proceeds in its mo&s;t natural and orderly train, when every one keeps within the bounds of his proper province; when, as long at his pur&s;uits are fair and lawful, he is allowed, without di&s;turbance, to conduct them in his own way. <HI>That ye &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do your own bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s; vi. 11.</NOTE> is the apo&s;tolical rule, and indeed the great rule, for pre&s;ervation of harmony and order. But &s;o it is, that in every age, a &s;et of men have exi&s;ted, who, driven by an unhappy activity of &s;pirit, oftner perhaps than by any &s;ettled de&s;ign of doing ill, or any motives of ambition or intere&s;t, love to intermeddle where they have no concern, to inquire into the private affairs of others, and from the imperfect information which they collect, to form conclu&s;ions concerning their circum&s;tances and character. The&s;e are they who in &s;cripture, are characteri&s;ed as <HI>tu~tlers, and bu&s;y
<PB N="85" REF="028306_0090_0FD89557D4201598">bodies in other mens matters,</HI> and from whom we are called to <HI>turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Though per&s;ons of this de&s;cription &s;hould be prompted by nothing but vain curio&s;ity, they are, ne|verthele&s;s, dangerous troublers of the world. While they conceive them&s;elves to be inoffen&s;ive, they are &s;owing di&s;&s;en&s;ion and feuds. Cro&s;&s;ing the lines in which others move, they create confu&s;ion, and awak|en re&s;entment. For every man conceives him&s;elf to be injured, when he finds another intruding in to his af|fairs, and, without any title, taking upon him to exam|ine his conduct. Being improperly and unnece&s;&s;ari|ly di&s;turbed, he claims the right of di&s;turbing in his turn tho&s;e who wantonly have troubled him. Hence, many a friend&s;hip has been broken; the peace of ma|ny a family has been overthrown; and much bitter and la&s;ting di&s;cord has been propagated through &s;ociety.</P>
<P>While this &s;pirit of meddling curio&s;ity injures &s;o con&s;iderably the peace and good order of the world, it al&s;o nouri&s;hes, among individuals who are addicted to it, a multitude of bad pa&s;&s;ions. Its mo&s;t frequent &s;ource is mere idlene&s;s, which, in it&s;elf a vice, never fails to engender many vices more. The mind of man cannot be long without &s;ome food to nouri&s;h the activity of its thoughts. The idle, who have no nouri&s;hment of this &s;ort within them&s;elves, feed their thoughts with inquiries into the conduct of their neighbours. The inqui&s;itive and curious are always talkative. What they learn, or fancy them&s;elves to have learned, concerning others, they are generally in ha&s;te to divulge. A tale which the malicious have invented, and the credulous have propagated; a ru|mour which, ari&s;ing among the multitude, and tran&s;|mitted by one to another, has, in every &s;tep of its pro|gre&s;s gained fre&s;h additions, becomes in the end the
<PB N="86" REF="028306_0091_0FD8955A803D3BC8">foundation of confident a&s;&s;ertion, and of ra&s;h and &s;e|vere judgment.</P>
<P>It is often by a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and rivalry, that the re&s;earches of &s;uch per&s;ons are prompted. They wi&s;h to di&s;cover &s;omething that will bring down their neighbour's character, circum&s;tances, or reputation, to the level of their own; or that will flatter them with an opinion of their own &s;uperiority. A &s;ecret malignity lies at the bottom of their inquiries. It may be concealed by an affected &s;how of candour and impartiality. It may even be veiled with the appearance of friendly concern for the intere&s;ts of oth|ers, and with affected apologies for their failings. But the hidden rancour is ea&s;ily di&s;covered.&mdash;While, therefore per&s;ons of this de&s;cription trouble the peace of &s;ociety, they at the &s;ame time poi&s;on their own minds with malignant pa&s;&s;ions. Their di&s;po&s;ition is entirely the rever&s;e of that amiable &s;pirit of charity, on which our religion lays &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s. Charity <HI>co|vereth the multitude of &s;ins;</HI> but this prying and med|dling &s;pirit &s;eeks to di&s;cover and divulge them. Cha|rity <HI>thinketh no evil;</HI> but this temper inclines us al|ways to &s;u&s;pect the wor&s;t. Charity <HI>rejoiceth not in in|iquity:</HI> this temper triumphs in the di&s;covery of errors and failings. Charity like the &s;un, brightens every object on which it &s;hines; a cen&s;orious di&s;po&s;ition ca&s;ts every character into the darke&s;t &s;hade it will bear.</P>
<P>It is to be farther ob&s;erved, that all impertinent curio&s;ity about the affairs of others tends greatly to ob&s;truct per&s;onal reformation; as it draws mens thoughts a&s;ide from what ought to be the chief ob|ject of attention, the improvement of their own heart and life. They who are &s;o officiou&s;ly occupied about their neighbours, have little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s inclina|tion, to ob&s;erve their own defects, or to mind their
<PB N="87" REF="028306_0092_0FD8955C070B96C0">own duty. From their inqui&s;itive re&s;earches, they find, or imagine they find, in the behaviour of others, an apology for their own failings: And the favour|ite re&s;ult of their inquiries generally is, to re&s;t &s;ati&s;|fied with them&s;elves. They are at lea&s;t as good, they think, as others around them. The condemnation which they pa&s;s on the vices of their neighbours, they interpret to be a &s;entiment of virtue in them|&s;elves. They become tho&s;e hypocrites de&s;cribed by our Lord, who &s;ee clearly <HI>the more that is in their neighbour's eye, while they di&s;ern not the beam that is in their own.</HI></P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a character as this, the doc|trine plainly inculcated by the text is, that to every man a particular charge is given by his Lord and Ma&s;ter, a part is a&s;&s;igned him by Providence to act; that to this he ought to bend his chief attention; and, in&s;tead of &s;crutini&s;ing the character or &s;tate of others, ought to think of him&s;elf, and leave them to &s;tand or fail by their own ma&s;ter. <HI>What &s;hall this man do?</HI> &s;aid Peter <HI>What,</HI> replies our Lord, <HI>is that to thee? Follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>Where per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s any important &s;tation, or di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, in the world, the application of this doctrine to them is manife&s;t. It they have any candour, they cannot refu&s;e to acknowledge that God and the world have a title to expect from them a dil|igent attention to their proper part in life; and that to wa&s;te their time in idle inquiries about others, with whom they have nothing to do, is reprehen&s;ible and &s;inful. But there are multitudes of mankind, to whom this appears in a very different light. They are humble and private men, who are willing to con|ceive them&s;elves as of little importance in the world. Having no exten&s;ive influence, and no call, as they think, to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by active exertions
<PB N="88" REF="028306_0093_0FD87F38E0D476F8">in any &s;phere, they imagine that they may innocent|ly lead an idle life, and indulge their curio&s;ity, by canva&s;&s;ing at plea&s;ure the character and the behaviour of tho&s;e around them. With per&s;ons of this de&s;crip|tion every &s;ociety too much abounds.&mdash;My brethren, no one ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf as in&s;ignificant in the &s;ight of God. In our &s;everal &s;tations we are all &s;ent forth to be labourers in God's vineyard. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he might, in one way or other, &s;erve God, promote virtue, and be u&s;eful in the world. <HI>Occupy till I come,</HI> is the charge given to all Chri&s;tians without exception. To be entirely unemployed and idle is the prerogative of no one, in any rank of life.</P>
<P>Even that &s;ex, who&s;e ta&s;k is not to mingle in the labours of public and active bu&s;ine&s;s, have their own part a&s;&s;igned them to act. In the quiet of dome&s;tic &s;hade, there are a variety of virtues to be exerci&s;ed, and of important duties to be di&s;charged. Much de|pends on them for the maintenance of private econ|omy and order, for the education of the young, and for the relief and comfort of tho&s;e who&s;e functions engaged them in the toils of the world. Even where no &s;uch female duties occur to be performed, the care of preparing for future u&s;efulne&s;s, and of at|taining &s;uch accompli&s;hments as procure ju&s;t e&s;teem, is laudable. In &s;uch duties and cares, how far better is time employed, than in that &s;earch into private concerns, that circulation of rumours, tho&s;e di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions of the conduct and de&s;cants on the character of others, which engro&s;s conver&s;ation &s;o much, and which end, for the mo&s;t part, in &s;everity of cen&s;ure!</P>
<P>In whatever condition we are placed, to act always in character &s;hould be our con&s;tant rule. He who acts in character is above contempt though his &s;tation
<PB N="89" REF="028306_0094_0FD8955EFAF1B8C0">be low. He who acts out of character is de&s;picable, though his &s;tation be ever &s;o high. <HI>What is that to thee,</HI> what this man or that man does? Think of what thou oughte&s;t to do thy&s;elf; of what is &s;uitable to thy character and place; of what the world has a title to expect from thee. Every excur&s;ion of vain curi|o&s;ity about others, is a &s;ubtraction from that time and thought which was due to our&s;elves and due to God. <HI>Having gifts,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul <HI>differing according to the grace that is given us, whether mini&s;try let us wait on our mini&s;tring; or he that teacheth on teach|ing; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth let him do it with &s;implicity; he that ruleth with diligence; he that &s;heweth mercy, with cheerfulne&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom xii. 6.9.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the great circle of human affairs there is room for every one to be bu&s;y and well employed in his own pro|vince, without encroaching upon that of others. It is the province of &s;uperiors, to direct; of inferiors, to obey; of the learned to be in&s;tructive; of the ignorant, to be docile; of the old to be communicative; of the young to be advi&s;eable and diligent. Art thou poor? Show thy&s;elf active and indu&s;trious, peaceable and contented. Art thou wealthy? Show thy&s;elf benefi|cent and charitable, conde&s;cending and humane. If thou live&s;t much in the world, it is thy duty to make the light of a good example &s;hine con&s;picuou&s;ly be|fore others. If thou live&s;t private and retired, it is thy bu&s;ine&s;s to improve thine own mind, and to add, if thou can&s;t do no more, one faithful &s;ubject to the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. There is indeed no man &s;o &s;e|que&s;tered from active life, but within his own narrow &s;phere he may find &s;ome opportunities of doing good; of cultivating friend&s;hip, promoting peace, and di&s;|charging
<PB N="90" REF="028306_0095_0FD895607B87C6D0">many of the&s;e le&s;&s;er offices of humanity and kindne&s;s, which are within the reach of every one, and which we all owe to one onother. In all the va|rious relations which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among us in life, as hu&s;band and wife, ma&s;ter and &s;ervants, parents and children, relations and friends, rulers and &s;ubjects, innumerable duties &s;tand ready to be performed; innumerable calls to virtuous activity pre&s;ent them|&s;elves on every hand, &s;ufficient to fill up with advan|tage and honour the whole time of man.</P>
<P>There is, in particular, one great and compre|hen&s;ive object of attention, which, in the text, is placed in direct oppo&s;ition to that idle curio&s;ity repre|hended by our Lord; that is, to follow Chri&s;t. <HI>Fol|low thou me.</HI> What this man or that man does; how he employs his time; how he &s;ucceeds in the world; are matters concerning which the information we re|ceive can never be of great importance to us; often, is of no importance at all. But how our Saviour behaved while he was on earth, or how, in our &s;itua|tion, he would have behaved, are matters of the high+e&s;t moment to every Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The commandment given in the text to <HI>follow him,</HI> includes both ob&s;ervance of his words, and imitation of his example. The words of Chri&s;t contain, as we all know, the &s;tanding rule of our life. His exam|ple exhibits the great model on which our conduct ought to be formed and it is to this that the precept here delivered directly refers.&mdash;Examples have great influence on all. But by all human examples, we are in danger of being occa&s;ionally mi&s;led. We are ever obliged to be on our guard, le&s;t the admira|tion of what is e&s;timable, betray us into a re&s;emb|lance of what is blemi&s;hed and faulty. For the mo&s;t perfect human characters, in the mid&s;t of their bright|ne&s;s
<PB N="91" REF="028306_0096_0FD89561F9DC39B0">and beauty, are always marked with &s;ome of tho&s;e dark &s;pots which &s;tains the nature of man. But our Lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men, without partaking any of their defects. In him, all was light without a &s;hade, and beauty with|out a &s;tain.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, his example is at|tended with this &s;ingular advantage, of being more accommodated than any other to general immitation. It was di&s;tingui&s;hed by no unnatural au&s;terities, no affected &s;ingularities; but exhibits the plain and &s;im|ple tenor of all tho&s;e virtues for which we have mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ion in ordinary life. In order to ren|der it of more univer&s;al benefit, our Lord fixed his re&s;idence in no particular place; he tied him&s;elf down to no particular calling or way of liv|ing; but gives us the opportunity or viewing his be|haviour, in that variety of lights which equally and indifferently rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll mankind. His life was divid|ed between the retired and the active &s;tate. Devoti|on and bu&s;ine&s;s equally &s;hared it. In the di&s;charge of that high office with which he was ve&s;ted, we be|hold the perfect model of a public character; and we behold the mo&s;t beautiful example of private life, when we contemplate him among his di&s;ciples, as a Father in the mid&s;t of his family.&mdash;By &s;uch means he has exhibited before us &s;pecimens of every kind of virtue; and to all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men has afford|ed a pattern after which they may copy. Hardly is there any emergency which can occur in life, but from &s;ome incident in our Saviour's conduct, from &s;ome feature di&s;played in his character, we are ena|bled to &s;ay to our&s;elves, <Q>Thus Chri&s;t would have &s;poken, thus he would have acted, thus he would have &s;uffered, if he had been circum&s;tance das we are now.</Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of thinking of thy neighbours
<PB N="92" REF="028306_0097_0FD8956383CE55B0">around thee, and of inquring how they behave, keep Chri&s;t in thine eye, and in thy whole conduct follow him. <HI>Follow him</HI> in his &s;teady and con&s;cientious di&s;|charge of duty, amid&s;t oppo&s;ition from evil men, and a corrupted world. Follow him in his patient &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his Father's will, and the calmne&s;s of his &s;pirit under all trials. Follow him in his acts of di&s;|intere&s;ted benevolence, in his compa&s;&s;ion to the un|happy, in readine&s;s to oblige, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and to releave. Immitate the mildne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of his manners. Imitate the affabiiity and conde&s;cen&s;ion which appear|ed in his behaviour. Imitate the uncorrupted &s;im|plicity and purity which di&s;tingui&s;hed his whole life.</P>
<P>The&s;e are much worthier and nobler objects of your attention, than any of tho&s;e tri&s;ting varieties which you can explore and di&s;cover in the characters of tho&s;e among whom you live. By lifting your view to &s;o high a &s;tandard, you will be pre&s;erved from de|&s;cending to tho&s;e futile and corrupting employments of thought, which occupy the idle, the vain, and the malignant. It is incredible, how much time and at|tention are thrown away by men, in examining the affairs of others, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing their conduct. Were their time and attention thrown away only, the evil would in &s;ome degree, be le&s;s. But they are wor&s;e than thrown away; they are not merely fruitle&s;s, but productive of much mi&s;chief. Such a habit of thought is connected with a thou&s;and vices. It is the con|&s;tant &s;ource of ra&s;h and &s;evere cen&s;ure. It ari&s;es from envy and jealou&s;y. It foments ill nature and pride.

<P>THESE words of our Lord were occa&s;ioned by a circum&s;tance in his behaviour which appeared my&s;terious to his di&s;ciples.

We &s;ee ju&s;tice and order begun; but on many occa|&s;ions they &s;eem to be de&s;erted. The ray of light which we had traced for a while, &s;uddenly for&s;akes us; and, where we had looked for the continuance of order, we meet with confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment. &mdash;For in&s;tance; when we examine the con&s;titution of the human mind, we di&s;cern evident marks of its being framed with a view to favour and reward virtue. Con&s;cience is endowed with &s;ignal authority to check vice. It brings home unea&s;ine&s;s and remor&s;e to the bad; and it &s;ooths and &s;upports the righteous with &s;elf approbation and peace. The ordinary cour&s;e of human things is made to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncide in &s;ome degree with this con&s;titution of our nature. The worthy and the good are in general, honoured and e&s;teemed. <HI>He that walketh uprightly,</HI> is, for the mo&s;t part, found to <HI>walk &s;urely.</HI> The chief misfortunes that befal us in life can be traced to &s;ome vices or follies which we have committed; and it almo&s;t never happens but the <HI>&s;inners own wickedne&s;s is made,</HI> &s;ooner or later, <HI>to reprove him, and his back&s;lidings to correct him.</HI></P>
<P>All this carries the impre&s;s of a ju&s;t Providence, of a wi&s;e and bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olent admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e, We cannot avoid perceiving that the Almighty hath <HI>&s;et his throne for judgment.</HI> At the &s;ame time, when we pur&s;ue our enquiries, the Almighty appears to <HI>hold back the face of his throne, and to &s;pread his cloud upon it.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job. xxvi. 9.</NOTE> For in looking abroad into the world how many &s;cenes do we behold, which are far from corre&s;pond|ing with any ideas we could form of the government of Heaven?

<PB N="96" REF="028306_0101_0FD87F887786C860">a &s;tate of barbarity and mi&s;ery; &s;unk in &s;uch gro&s;s ig|norance as degrades them below the rank of rational beings; or abandoned to be the prey of cruel oppre&s;|&s;ion and tyranny. When we look to the &s;tate of in|dividuals around us, we hear the lamentations of the unhappy on every hand. We meet with weeping pa|rents and mourning friends. We behold the young cut off in the flower of their days, and the aged left de&s;olate in the mid&s;t of &s;orrows. The u&s;eful and virtuous are &s;wept away, and the worthle&s;s left to flouri&s;h. The lives of the be&s;t men are often fil|led with di&s;couragements and di&s;appointed hopes. Merit langui&s;hes in neglected &s;olitude; and vanity and pre&s;umption gain the admiration of the world. From the &s;courge of calumny, and from the hand of violence the injured look up to God as the Avenger of their cau&s;e; but often they look up in vain. He is <HI>a God that hideth him&s;elf.</HI> He dwelleth, as to them, in the &s;ecret place of darkne&s;s; or if he dwelleth in light, it is in <HI>light to which no man can approach.</HI> Re|&s;ignation may &s;eal up their lips; but in &s;ilence they drop the tear, and mourn while they adore.</P>
<P>Such, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, are the difficulties which encounter us when we attempt to trace the pre&s;ent ways of God. At the &s;ame time, upon re|flection, we may be &s;atisfied that cau&s;es can be a&s;&s;ign|ed for things appearing in this unfavourable light; and that there is no rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the divine conduct being my&s;terious at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The monarchy of the univer&s;e is a great and compli|cated &s;y&s;tem. It comprehends numberle&s;s generations of men, who are brought forth to act their parts for purpo&s;es unknown to us. It includes two worlds at once; the world that now is, and which is only a &s;mall portion of exi&s;tence; and a world that is to come, which endures for eternity. To us, no more
<PB N="97" REF="028306_0102_0FD87F8A8C7A61B8">than the beginnings of things are vi&s;ible. We &s;ee only &s;ome broken parts of a great whole. We trace but a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inks of that chain of being, which, by &s;ecret connections, binds together the pre&s;ent and the future. Such knowledge is afforded us as is &s;ufficient for &s;upplying the exigencies and wants of our pre&s;|ent &s;tate; but it does no more. Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the univer&s;e, we attempt in vain to explore the coun&s;els that govern the world. It is an attempt to &s;ound an un&s;athomable deep with a &s;can|ty line; and with a feeble wing to a&s;cend above the &s;tars. In any complicated wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even of human art, it is found nece&s;&s;ary to be acquainted with the de&s;ign of the whole, in order to judge of the fitne&s;s of its parts. In a &s;cheme &s;o complex as the admini&s;tration of the world, where all the parts refer to one anoth|er, and where what is &s;een is often &s;ubordinate to what is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ible, how is it po&s;&s;ible but our judgments mu&s;t be often erroneous, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mplain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ill-foun|ded? If a pea&s;ant or a cottager be incapable of judging of the government of a mighty empire, is it &s;ur|pri&s;ing that we &s;hould be at a lo&s;s concerning the con|duct of the Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds his creatures? <HI>What I do thou knowe&s;t not now.</HI></P>
<P>But, on this argument &s;till more can be &s;aid for our &s;atisfaction. We are to ob&s;erve, that complete information re&s;pecting the ways of God, not only was not to be expected here but, moreover, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it would have been hurtful, if granted to us in our pre&s;|ent &s;tate. It would have proved incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;tate; with the actions which we have to perform in it, and the duties we have to fulfil. It would indeed have overthrown the whole de&s;ign of our being pla|ced in this world. We are placed here under the trial of our virtue. Ignorance of the ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts that are ordained to be&s;al us, ignorance of the plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the
<PB N="98" REF="028306_0103_0FD87F8C11C2B120">decrees of heaven, enter nece&s;&s;arily into a &s;tate of tri|al. In order to exerci&s;e both our intellectual and moral powers, and to carry them forward to im|provement, we mu&s;t be left to find our way in the mid&s;t of difficulties and doubts, of hard&s;hips, and &s;ufferings. We mu&s;t be taught to act our part with con&s;tancy, though the reward of our con&s;tancy, be di&s;t|ant. We mu&s;t learn to bear with patience whate|ver our Creator judges proper to lay upon us, though we &s;ee not the rea&s;on of the hard&s;hips he inflicts. If we were let into the &s;ecret of the whole plan of Prov|idence; if the ju&s;tice of Heaven were, in every &s;tep of its procedure, made manife&s;t to our view, man would no longer be the creature he now is, nor would his pre&s;ent &s;tate an&s;wer any purpo&s;e of di&s;cipline or trial.</P>
<P>My&s;tery and darkne&s;s, therefore, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity now take place in the cour&s;e of things. Our pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate can be no other than a &s;tate of twilight or dawn, where dubious forms &s;hall often pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, and where we &s;hall find our&s;elves in a middle condition between complete light and total darkne&s;s. Had we enjoyed no evidence of a ju&s;t Judge ruling the earth, and of his providence, interpo&s;ing in our affairs, virtue would have been altogether de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> of its encouragement and &s;upport. Had the evidence, on the other hand, been &s;o &s;trong as to place the Almighty con&s;tantly before our eyes, the intention of our pre|&s;ent exi&s;tence would have been defeated, and no trial of virtue have remained. In&s;tead therefore, of com|plaining of the ob&s;curity which at pre&s;ent covers the conduct of Providence, we &s;ee that, on the whole, we have rea&s;on to &s;ubmit and adore.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BONDAGE and &s;ubjection are di&s;agreeable &s;ounds to the ear, di&s;agreeable ideas to the mind. The advocates of vice, taking advantage of tho&s;e na|tural impre&s;&s;ions, have in every age employed them for di&s;crediting religion. They repre&s;ent it as the bondage and confinenement of the free-bron &s;oul of man; as a &s;tate of perpetual con&s;traint, formed by a &s;y&s;tem of &s;evere rules, which de&s;igning men have contrived to impo&s;e as fetters on the multitude. On the other hand, they paint a licentious cour&s;e to them|&s;elves, and hold it out to the world, as the gay and plea&s;urable enjoyment of life; whore, having &s;ur|mounted the prejudices of education, and timor|ous &s;cruples of con&s;cience, men can think and act at plea&s;ure, and give full &s;cope to every wi&s;h of the heart.&mdash; But what if tho&s;e pretended &s;ons of freedom be them|&s;elves
<PB N="106" REF="028306_0111_0FD87F98C5288E80">held in mi&s;erable &s;ubjection, and their boa&s;ts of liberty be no more than the <HI>&s;welling words of vani|ty?</HI> The Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts in the text, that while they <HI>promi&s;e liberty</HI> to others, they are <HI>the &s;ervants,</HI> or &s;laves, of <HI>corruption, overcome, and brought into bondage by it.</HI> This a&s;&s;ertion of the Apo&s;tle I purpo&s;e to illu&s;trate. I &s;hall endeavour to make it appear, that no true li|berty can ari&s;e from vice; that bad men undergo the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t &s;ervitude; and that no one is free, but he who is virtuous and good.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to begin with removing fal&s;e ideas of liberty, and &s;howing in what it truely con&s;i&s;ts. We are not to imagine that to be free imports our be|ing &s;et loo&s;e from re&s;traint or rule of every kind. No man, in any condition of life, is at liberty to act always as he plea&s;es, and to gratify every wi&s;h he forms. The nature of the human &s;tate necer&s;arily impo&s;es on all men various re&s;traints. The laws of &s;ociety allow no one to indulge him&s;elf in pur&s;uits or plea&s;ures that are injurious to his neighbour. Even our own nature limits our plea&s;ures within certain bounds. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l our de&s;ires cannot be gratified together. They frequently interfere, and reqiure im who would indulge one favourite pa&s;&s;ion, to deny him&s;elf in an|other. Di&s;tinctions, therefore, mu&s;t be made, pre|&s;erences be given, and &s;ome general regolation of con|duct be ob&s;erved, by every one who con&s;ults his own welfare. If there be any regulation which en&s;ures us of &s;afety and happine&s;s, to be di&s;engaged from the ob&s;ervance of that regulation is no article of liberty; at lea&s;t of &s;uch liberty; as a wi&s;e man would with to en|joy. It is in effect to be turned loo&s;e to our own ruin. It is &s;uch liberty as a blind man enjoys, of wander|ing at random, and &s;triking into every devious path, without a guide to direct his &s;teps, and &s;ave him from de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="028306_0112_0FD87F9A466CCA68">
That unbounded licentiou&s;ne&s;s, therefore, which &s;inners prefer to every regulation of conduct, is alto|gether different from true freedom. It is in moral behaviour the &s;ame as anarchy is in a &s;tate, where law and order are extinct. Anarchy, &s;urely, is no le&s;s incompatible with true liberty than ab&s;olute de&s;po|ti&s;m; and of the two it is hard to &s;ay which is the lea&s;t eligible, or the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate. Liberty by no means &s;uppo&s;es the ab&s;ence of all government. It only &s;uppo&s;es that the government under which we are placed is wi&s;e; and that the re&s;traints to which we voluntarily &s;ubmit our&s;elves have been contrived for the general intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To be free, therefore, imports, in general, our being placed in &s;uch circum&s;tances, that within the bounds of ju&s;tice and good order, we can act accord|ing to our own deliberate choice, and take &s;uch mea|&s;ures for our conduce as we have rea&s;on to believe are conducive to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lfare; without being ob&s;tructed either by external force, or by violent internal im|pul&s;e. This is that happy and dignified &s;tate which every wi&s;e man earne&s;tly wi&s;hes to enjoy. The advantages which re&s;ult from it are chiefly the&s;e three; freedom of choice; independence of mind boldne&s;s and &s;ecurity. In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of liberty, I now proceed to &s;how that, in the fir&s;t place, vice deprives bad men of free choice in their actions; that, in the &s;econd place, it brings them under a &s;lavi&s;h dependence on external circum&s;tances; and that, in the third place, it reduces them to that abject, cowardly, and di&s;qui|eted &s;tate which is e&s;&s;entially characteri&s;tic of bon|dage.</P>
<P N="1">I. Vice is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, as it deprives &s;inners of the power of free choice, by bringing them under the dominion of pa&s;&s;ions and habits. Religion
<PB N="108" REF="028306_0113_0FD87F9BE2F7CC28">and virtue addre&s;s them&s;elves to rea&s;on. They call us to look round on every &s;ule; to think well of the con&s;equences of our actions; and, before we take any &s;tep of importance, to compare the good with the evil that may en&s;ue from it. He therefore who follows their dectates, acts the part of a man who freely con&s;ults, and chu&s;es, for his own intere&s;t. But vice can make no preten&s;ions of this kind. It awaits no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the te&s;t of deliberate compari&s;on and choice; but overpowers us at once by &s;ome &s;triking impre&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent advantage or enjoyment. It hurries us with the violence of pa&s;&s;ion; captivates us by the allure|ments of plea&s;ure; or dazzels us by the glare of riches. The &s;inner yields to the impul&s;e, merely becau&s;e he cannot re&s;i&s;t it. Rea&s;on remon&s;trates; con&s;cience endeavours to check him; but all in vain. Having once allowed &s;ome &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion to gain the a&s;cendant, he has thrown him&s;elf into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">dle of a torrent, again&s;t which he may &s;ometimes faintly &s;truggle, but the impetuo&s;ity of the &s;tream bears him along. In this &s;ituation he is &s;o far from being free, that he is not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. He does not go, but is driven; to&s;&s;ed, agitated, and impelled; pa&s;&s;ive, like a &s;hip to the violence of the waves.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ion has for a while exerci&s;ed its tyranni|cal &s;way, its vehemence may by degrees &s;ub&s;ide. But when by long indulgence, it has e&s;tabli&s;hed habits of gratification, the &s;inner's bondage becomes then more confirmed, and more mi&s;erable. For during the heat of pur&s;uit he is little capable of reflection. But when his ardour is abated, and neverthele&s;s, a vitious habit rooted, he has full lei&s;ure to perceive the heavy yoke he has brought upon him&s;elf. How many &s;laves do we &s;ee in the world to intemperance, and all kinds of criminal plea&s;ure, merely though the influence of cu&s;toms which they had allowed to become &s;o inveter|ate
<PB N="109" REF="028306_0114_0FD87F9E246A28A8">that it was not in their power to alter them? Are they not often reduced to a condition &s;o wretched, that when their licentious plea&s;ures have become utterly in&s;ipid, they are &s;till forced to continue them, &s;olely becau&s;e they cannot refrain: not becau&s;e the indulg|ence gives them plea&s;ure, but becau&s;e ab&s;tinence would give them pain; and this too, even when they are obliged at la&s;t to condemn their habits of life, as injuring their fortune, impairing their con&s;titution, or di&s;gracing their character? Vice is not of &s;uch a nature that we can &s;ay to it, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come and no further.</HI> Having once entered into its territories, it is not in our power to make a retreat when we plea&s;e. <HI>He that committeth &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in.</HI> No man who has once yielded up the governmen of his mind, and given loo&s;e rein to his de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions can tell how far the&s;e may carry him. He may be brought into &s;uch a de&s;perate &s;tate, that nothing &s;hall remain for him but to look back with regret upon the for&s;aken path of innocence and liberty; and, &s;everely con&s;cious of the thraldom he &s;uffers, to groan under fetters which he de&s;pairs of throwing off. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good who are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xiii. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>Vice confirms its dominion, and extends it &s;till farther over the &s;oul, by compelling the &s;inner to &s;up|port one crime by means of another. Not only is he en&s;laved to tho&s;e vices which take their ri&s;e from his one inclination, but they render others nece&s;&s;ary, to which, again&s;t his inclination, he mu&s;t &s;ubmit; and thereby &s;trengthen the commanding power of ini|quity within him. The immoderate love of plea&s;ure for in&s;tance, leads him into expen&s;e beyond his for|tune. In order to &s;upport that expen&s;e, he is oblig|ed
<PB N="110" REF="028306_0115_0FD8802209167A20">to have recour&s;e to low and di&s;honourable methods of gain, which originally he de&s;pi&s;ed. To cover the&s;e, he is forced upon arts of di&s;&s;imulation and fraud. One in&s;tance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> obliges him to &s;upport it by another; till, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there ari&s;es a character of complicated vice; of luxury &s;hooting forth into ba&s;e|ne&s;s, di&s;hone&s;ty, inju&s;tice, and perhaps cruelty. It is thus that one favourite pa&s;&s;ion brings in a tribe of auxiliaries to complete the dominion of &s;in. Among all our corrupt pa&s;&s;ions there is a &s;trong and intimate connection. When any one of them is adopted into our family, it never quits us until it has fathered upon us all its kindred.&mdash;By &s;uch means as the&s;e, by the violence of pa&s;&s;ions, by the power of habits, and by the connection of one vice with another, &s;in e&s;tab|li&s;hes that &s;ervitude over the will, which deprives bad men of all power of free choice in their actions.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;lavery produced by vice appears in the dependence under which it brings the &s;inner, to cir|cum&s;tances of external fortune. One of the favour|ite characters of liberty, is the independence it be|&s;tows. He who is truly a freeman is above all &s;ervile compliances, and abject &s;ubjection. He is able to re&s;t upon him&s;elf; and while he regards his &s;uperiors with proper deference, neither deba&s;es him&s;elf by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purcha&s;e their fa|vour by di&s;honourable means. But the &s;inner has forfeited every privilege of this nature. His pa&s;&s;i|ons and habits render him an ab&s;olute dependant on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickel humours of men. For it is by the&s;e he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and among the&s;e his happine&s;s is &s;ought; according as his pa&s;&s;ions deter|mine him to pur&s;ue plea&s;ures, riches, or preferments. Having no fund within him&s;elf whence to draw en|joyment, his only re&s;ource is in things without. His
<PB N="111" REF="028306_0116_0FD88023545CB138">hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He par|takes in all its vici&s;&s;itudes; and is moved and &s;haken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the &s;trict|e&s;t &s;en&s;e a &s;lave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. <HI>The up|right man is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf.</HI> He de&s;pi&s;es not the advantages of fortune; but he centers not his hap|pine&s;s in them. With a moderate &s;hare of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Hap|py in his own integrity, con&s;cious of the e&s;teem of good men, repo&s;ing firm tru&s;t in the providence, and the promi&s;es of God, he is exempted from &s;ervile de|pendence on other things. He can wrap him|&s;elf up in a good con&s;cience, and look forward, with|out terror, to the change of the world. Let all things &s;hift around him as they plea&s;e, he believes that, by the divine ordination, they &s;hall be made <HI>to work to|gether</HI> in the i&s;&s;ue <HI>for his good:</HI> And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be ea&s;y in every &s;tate. One who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es within him&s;elf &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment of mind, is truly free&mdash;But &s;hall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property a&s;&s;ured; who&s;e very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and the &s;port of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever &s;o &s;plendid, whom his impe|rious pa&s;&s;ions detain at their call, whom they &s;end forth at their plea&s;ure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the ca&s;ual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of the world? Is he free, who mu&s;t flatter and lie to compa&s;s his ends; who mu&s;t bear with this man's caprice, and that man's &s;corn; mu&s;t profe&s;s friend|&s;hip where he hates, and re&s;pect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours,
<PB N="112" REF="028306_0117_0FD88024B5CAA528">nor to &s;peak his own &s;entiments; who dares not be hone&s;t, le&s;t he &s;hould be poor?&mdash;Believe it, no chains bind &s;o hard, no &s;etters are &s;o heavy, as tho&s;e which fa&s;ten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the voluptuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man lies to the means of plea&s;ure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boa&s;red liberty, which vice promi&s;es, as the recompen&s;e of &s;etting us free from the &s;alutary re&s;traints of virtue.</P>
<P N="3">III. Another character of the &s;lavery of vice, is that mean, cowardly, di&s;quieted &s;tate, to which it reduces the &s;inner. Boldne&s;s and magnanimity have ever been accounted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> native effects of liberty. He who enjoys it, having nothing to apprehend from op|pre&s;&s;ive power, performs the offices, and enjoys the comforts of life, with a manly and undi&s;turbed mind. Hence his behaviour is dignified, and his &s;entiments are honourable; while he who is accu&s;tomed to bend under &s;ervile &s;ubjection, has always been found mean-&s;pirited, timorous, and ba&s;e.&mdash;Compare, in the&s;e re&s;pects, the virtuous and the vicious man, and you will ea&s;ily &s;ee to which of them the characteri&s;tics of freedom mo&s;t ju&s;tly belong. The man of virtue, relying on a good con&s;cience and the protection of Heaven, acts with firmne&s;s and comage; and in the di&s;charge of his duty, fears not the face of man. The man of vice, con&s;cious of his low and corrupt aims, &s;hrinks before the &s;teadfa&s;t and piercing eye of integri|ty; is ever looking around him with anxious and fearful circum&s;pection, and thinking of &s;ubterfuges, by which he may e&s;cape from danger. The one is <HI>bold as a lion;</HI> the other <HI>&s;ticth when no man pur&s;ueth.</HI> To the one, nothing appears contemptible, by which he can procure any pre&s;ent advantage. The other looks with di&s;dain on what ever would degrade his
<PB N="113" REF="028306_0118_0FD880264DDD02E0">character. "I will not," &s;ays he, <Q>&s;o demean my|&s;elf, as to catch the favour of the greate&s;t man, by this or that low art. It &s;hall not be &s;aid or thought of me, that I did what was ba&s;e in order to make my fortune. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers &s;toop &s;o low, who cannot be without the &s;avours of the world. But I can want them, and therefore at &s;uch a price I will not pur|cha&s;e them.</Q> This is the voice of true liberty; and &s;peaks that greatne&s;s of mind which it is form|ed to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Corre&s;ponding to that abject di&s;po&s;ition which characteri&s;es a bad man, are the fears that haunt him. The terrors of a &s;lave dwell on his mind, and often appear in his behaviour. For guilt is never free from &s;u&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cion and alarm. The &s;inner is afraid, &s;ome|times, of the partners of his crimes, le&s;t they betray him; &s;ometimes, of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by his crimes, le&s;t they revenge them&s;elves; frequently, of the world around him, le&s;t it detect him; and what is wor&s;t of all, he is reduced to be afraid of him&s;elf. There is a witne&s;s within him that te&s;tifies again&s;t his mi&s;deeds; and threate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> him in &s;ecret, when other alarms leave him. Con&s;cience holds up to his view the image of his pa&s;t crimes, with this in&s;crip|tion engraved upon it, <HI>"God will bring every work into judgment."</HI> How oppo&s;ite is &s;uch a &s;tate as this, to the peaceful &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from the liberty enjoy|ed by the virtuons?&mdash;Were there nothing more in the circum&s;tances of &s;inners to affix upon them the marks of &s;ervitude, this alone would be &s;ufficient, that, as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>through fear of death they are all their lifetime &s;ubject to bondage.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE> Death &s;ets all other captives free. The &s;lave who digs in the mine, or labours at the oar, can rejoice in the
<PB N="114" REF="028306_0119_0FD88027E50C3CD8">pro&s;pect of laying down his burden together with his life; and ta&s;tes the hope of being at la&s;t on equal terms with his cruel oppre&s;&s;or. But to the &s;lave of guilt there ari&s;es no hope from death. On the con|trary he is obliged to look forward with con&s;tant ter|ror to this mo&s;t certain of all events, as the conclu|&s;ion of all his hopes and the commencement of his greate&s;t mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>I have thus &s;et before you &s;uch clear and unequivo|cal marks of the &s;ervitude undergone by &s;inners, as fully verify the a&s;&s;ertion in the text, that a &s;tate of vice and corruption is a &s;tate of bondage. In order to perceive how &s;evere a bondage it is, let us attend to &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances of aggravation which belong to it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It is a bondage to which the mind it&s;elf, the native feat of liberty, is &s;ubjected. In other ca&s;es, a brave man can comfort him&s;elf with reflecting that let tyrants do their wor&s;t, let pri&s;ons or fetters be his lot, his mind remains unconquered and free. Of this liberty they cannot rob him; here he moves in a higher &s;phere, above the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion or con|finement. But what avails the &s;how of external lib|berty, to one who has lo&s;t the government of him|&s;elf? As our Saviour rea&s;ons, in another ca&s;e, <HI>If the light that is in thee be darkne&s;s, how great is that darkne&s;s?</HI> So we may rea&s;on here, if that part of thy nature, thy mind, thy will, by which only thou can&s;t enjoy and reli&s;h liberty, be it&s;elf in bondage to evil pa&s;&s;ions and habits, how mi&s;erable mu&s;t be that bondage?</P>
<P>Next. It is aggravated by this con&s;ideration, that it is a bondage which we have brought upon our|&s;elves. To have been forced into &s;lavery, is mis|fortune and mi&s;ery. But to have renounced our lib|erty and cho&s;en to be &s;laves, is the greate&s;t reproach
<PB N="115" REF="028306_0120_0FD880294C0E4208">added to the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. Moments there fre|quently mu&s;t be, when a &s;inner is &s;en&s;ible of the de|gradation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;tate; when he feels with pain the &s;lavi&s;h dependence under which he is brought to for|tune and the world, to violent pa&s;&s;ions and &s;ettled ha|bits, and to fears and apprehen&s;ions ari&s;ing from con|&s;cious guilt. In &s;uch moments, how cruel is the reflection, that of all this di&s;grace and mi&s;ery he has been the author to him&s;elf; that by voluntary com|pliance, he has given to his pa&s;&s;ions that haughty a&s;|cendant which they now exerci&s;e over him; has forged the chains with which he is bound; and &s;old him&s;elf to do iniquity!</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The &s;ervitude of vice is accompanied with this farther aggravation, that it is &s;ubjection to our own &s;ervants. Tho&s;e de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, which the &s;inner has rai&s;ed to lawle&s;s rule, were given us as in&s;truments of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; but were plainly de&s;igned to be under the direction of a higher power. Of them&s;elves, they are head-&s;trong and blind; they bear all the marks of intended &s;ubordination; and con&s;cience is inve&s;ted with every en&s;ign of authority and &s;upremacy. But &s;in inverts the whole frame of human nature. It compels rea&s;on to bow down before tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it was formed to command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and leads it, as is were in triumph, to grace the &s;hameful conque&s;t of its mini&s;ters and &s;ervants. It has been always ob&s;erved that none are &s;o in&s;olent in power, as they who have u&s;urped an authority to which they had no right; and &s;o it is found to hold in this in|&s;tance. The de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited &s;way, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is &s;ub|ject to divers, and contradictory as well as imperi|ous ma&s;ters, who often pull him different ways. His &s;oul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant
<PB N="116" REF="028306_0121_0FD8802AAD999580">and jarring di&s;po&s;itions; and re&s;embles &s;ome barbar|ous country, cantoned out into different principalities, who are continually waging war on one another.&mdash; Such is the &s;tate into which &s;inners have brought them|&s;elves, in order to be free from the &s;uppo&s;ed confine|ment of virtue. Where they had promi&s;ed them|&s;elves nothing but ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, they are made to experience re&s;traints more &s;evere, and mortificati|ons more painful, than any which they would have undergone under the di&s;cipline of religion.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended by &s;ome, that al|though the repre&s;entation which has now been given of the &s;lavery of &s;in holds true in certain in&s;tances, yet that is applicable only to tho&s;e who come under the di&s;cription of atrocious &s;inners. They imagine that a certain moderate cour&s;e may be held in vice, by means of which, men, without throwing alto|gether a&s;ide the re&s;traints of rea&s;on, may enjoy an ea&s;y and plea&s;urable life.&mdash;By rea&s;oning thus, my friends, you flatter and deceive your&s;elves to your own de&s;truction. Be a&s;&s;ured, that by every vitious indulgence, you are making an approach to a &s;tate of complete &s;lavery; you are forfeiting a certain &s;hare of your liberty; how &s;oon the whole of it may be forfeited, you are not aware. It is true that all which has now been &s;aid of the &s;ervitude of &s;in, ap|plies only to a character corrupted in the extreme. But, remember that to this extreme no man ever arrives at once. He pa&s;&s;es through many of tho&s;e intermediate &s;tages, in one of which you are now perhaps found. Vice always creeps by degrees; and in&s;en&s;ibly twines around us tho&s;e concealed fet|ters by which we are at la&s;t completely bound.&mdash;As you value therefore your liberty and your happine&s;s, avoid every approach to evil. Con&s;ider all vicious plea&s;ures as enchanted ground, by entering on which,

<P>GOD <HI>is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> That religi|on chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in an inward principle of good|ne&s;s, is beyond di&s;pute, and that its value and efficacy are derived f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om its effects in purifying the heart, and reforming the life. All external &s;ervices, which have not this tendency, are entirely in&s;ignificant. They degenerate into mere &s;uper&s;tition, equally un-acceptable to God, and unprofitable to man. Hence they are &s;o often treated in &s;cripture with high con|tempt, when &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the impor|tant duties of a virtuous life.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="028306_0123_0FD8802C2BE4E488">
Notwith&s;tanding this, it is certain that external &s;ervices have their own place, and a con&s;iderable one too, in the &s;y&s;tem of religion. What their proper place is no one can be at a lo&s;s to di&s;cern, who will only make a ju&s;t di&s;tinction between the means, and the end, in religion. It is evident there is danger of mens erring here, either on one &s;ide or other; and it is certain that they have erred on both. After it was ob&s;erved, that mankind were prone to lay too much weight on the external parts of religion, it began to be thought, that no weight was to be allowed to them at all. The time was, when all religion cen|tered in attending the duties of the church, and pay|ing veneration to whatever was accounted &s;acred. This alone &s;anctified the character, and compen&s;ated every blemi&s;h in moral conduct. From this extreme, the &s;pirit of the age &s;eems to be running fa&s;t into the oppo&s;ire extreme, of holding every thing light that belongs to public wor&s;hip. But if &s;uper&s;tition be an evil, and a great one it undoubtedly is, irreligi|on is not a &s;maller evil. And though the <HI>form of godli|ne&s;s</HI> may often remain, when <HI>the power</HI> of it is want|ing; yet the <HI>power</HI> cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t where the <HI>form</HI> is altogether gone.&mdash;The holy P&s;almi&s;t, who&s;e words are now before us, di&s;covers much better principles. Expre&s;&s;ing always the highe&s;t regard for the laws of God, and the precepts of virtue, he breathes, at the &s;ame time, a &s;pirit of pure devotion. Though load|ed with the cares of royalty, and encircled with the &s;plendour of a court, he thought it well became him to &s;how re&s;pect to the great Lord of nature; and on many occa&s;ions expre&s;&s;es, as he does in the text, his delight in the public &s;ervice of the temple. <HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</HI> In di&s;cour&s;ing from which words I purpo&s;e to &s;how the importance of
<PB N="119" REF="028306_0124_0FD8802ED58B9060">the public wor&s;hip of God, and the benefits re&s;ulting from it. I &s;hall con&s;ider it in three lights; as it re|&s;pects God; as it re&s;pects the world; as it re&s;pects our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I. Let us con&s;ider it with re&s;pect to God. If there exi&s;t a Supreme Being, the Creator of the word, no con&s;equence appears more natural and direct than this, that he ought to be wor&s;hipped by his creatures, with every outward expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and honour. We need only appeal to every man's heart, whether this be not a princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple which carries along with it its own obligation, that to Him who is the Fountain of our life, and the Father of our mercies; to Him who has rai&s;ed up that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">autiful &s;tructure of the univer&s;e in which we dwell, and where we are &s;urrounded with &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings and comforts; &s;olemn acknowledg|ments of gratitude &s;hould be made, prai&s;es and prayers &s;hould be offered, and ali &s;uitable marks of dependence on him be expre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;This ob|ligation extends beyond the &s;ilent and &s;ecret &s;en|timents of our hearts. Be&s;ides private devoti|on, it naturally leads to a&s;&s;ociations for public wor&s;hip; to open and declared profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect for the Deity. Where ble&s;&s;ings are received in com|mon, an obligation lies upon the community, jointly to acknowledge them. Sincere gratitude is always of open and diffu&s;ive nature. It loves to pour it&s;elf forth; to give free vent to its emotions; and, before the world, to acknowledge and honour a Benefactor.</P>
<P>So con&s;onant is this to the natural &s;entiments of mankind, that all the nations of the earth have, as with one con&s;ent, agreed to in&s;titute &s;ome forms of wor&s;hip; to hold meetings, at certain times, in ho|nour of their deities. Survey the &s;ocieties of men in their rude&s;t &s;tate; explore the African de&s;erts, the wilds of America or the di&s;tant i&s;lands of the ocean;
<PB N="120" REF="028306_0125_0FD880319BF6DBF8">and you will find that over all the earth &s;ome religious ceremonies have obtained. You will every where trace, in one form or other, the temple, the prie&s;t, and the offering. The prevalence of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;titions furni&s;hes this te&s;timony to the truth, that in the hearts of all men the principle is engraved, of wor&s;hip being due to that invi&s;ible Power who rules the world.&mdash;Herein con&s;i&s;ts the great excellency of Chri&s;tian religion, that it hath in&s;tructed us in the &s;imple and &s;piritual nature of that wor&s;hip. Di&s;en|cumbered of idle and unmeaning ceremonies, its ri|tual is pure, and worthy of a divine Author. Its po&s;itive in&s;titutions are few in number, mo&s;t &s;ignifi|cant of &s;piritual things, and directly conductive to good life and practice. How inexcu&s;able then are we, if, placed in &s;uch happy circum&s;tances, the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e obligations to the public wor&s;hip of God &s;hall be obliterated among us, which the light of na|ture inculcated, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the mo&s;t wild and barbarous nations?</P>
<P>The refinements of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy have indeed &s;ugge&s;ted this &s;hadow of objection, that God is too great to &s;tand in need of any external &s;ervice from his creatures: that our expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e and honour are mi&s;placed with re&s;pect to him, who is above all honour and all prai&s;e; that in his &s;ight the homage we &s;eek to pay mu&s;t appear contemptible; and is therefore in it&s;elf &s;uperfluous and trifling.&mdash;But But who hath taught tho&s;e vain rea&s;oners, that all expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and honour towards a &s;u|perior become un&s;uitable, merely becau&s;e that &s;upe|rior needs not any returns? Where they ever in|debted to one who&s;e favours they had it not in their power to repay; and, did they, on that account, feel them&s;elves &s;et loo&s;e from every obligation to ac|knowledge, and to prai&s;e their benefactor? On the
<PB N="121" REF="028306_0126_0FD88032FB039EC8">contrary, the more di&s;intere&s;ted his beneficence was, did not gratitude, in any ingenuous mind, burn with the greate&s;t ardour, and prompt them the more eager|ly to &s;eize every opportunity of publicly te&s;tifying the feelings of their hearts?&mdash;Almighty God, it is true, is too great to need our &s;ervice or homage. But he is al&s;o too good not to accept it, when it is the native expre&s;&s;ion of a grateful and generous mind. If pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency &s;tiffle all &s;enti|ments of dependence on our Creator; if levity, and attachment to worldly plea&s;ures, render us totally ne|glectful of expre&s;&s;ing our thankfulne&s;s to Him for his ble&s;&s;ings; do we not hereby di&s;cover &s;uch a want of proper feeling, &s;uch a degree of hardne&s;s and cor|ruption in our affections, as &s;hows us to be immoral and unworthy; and mu&s;t ju&s;tly expo&s;e us to the high di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven? On the contrary, according to every notion which we can form of the Father of the univer&s;e, mu&s;t it not be acceptable to him to behold his creatures properly affected in heart towards their great benefactor; a&s;&s;embling together to expre&s;s, in acts of wor&s;hip, that gratitude, love, and reverence which they owe him; and thus nouri&s;hing and pro|moting in one another an affectionate &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s? Are not &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;uch a be|haviour as this, intimately connected with all virtue?</P>
<P><HI>O Come, let us wor&s;hip and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God; and we are the flock of his pa&s;ture. Enter into his gates with thank&s;giving and his courts with prai&s;e. The prayer of the upright is his delight. It cometh before him as in|cen&s;e, and the uplifting of their hands as the evening &s;ac|rifice.</HI>&mdash;Having thus &s;hown the rea&s;onablene&s;s of public wor&s;hip with re&s;pect to God, let us now.</P>
<P N="2">II. Con&s;ider its importance in another view, as it re&s;pects the world. When we &s;urvey the general
<PB N="122" REF="028306_0127_0FD88034843554E0">&s;tate of mankind, we find them continually immer&s;|ed in worldly affairs; bu&s;ied about providing the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, occupied in the pur&s;uits of their plea|&s;ures, or eagerly pro&s;ecuting the advancement of their intere&s;ts. In &s;uch a &s;ituation of things, a &s;mall mea|&s;ure of reflection might convince any one, that with|out &s;ome returns of &s;acred days, and &s;ome &s;olemn calls to public wor&s;hip, it were impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve in the world any &s;en&s;e of objects, &s;o foreign to the gen|eral current of thought as an invi&s;ible Governor, and a future &s;tate. If it be of importance to the peace and good order of &s;ociety, that there &s;hould prevail among men the belief of One in the heavens, who is the protector of righteou&s;ne&s;s and the avenger of crimes; if it be of importance that they be taught to look forward to a day of judgment, when they are to be brought to account for their mo&s;t &s;ecret actions and eternally rewarded or puni&s;hed, according as their conduct has been good or evil; if &s;uch principles as the&s;e, I &s;ay, be of con&s;equence to the public welfare, they certainly enforce the authority of public wor&s;hip, and prove the nece&s;&s;ity of religions in&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now particulary with a view to the multi|tude, the great ma&s;s and body of the people. We all know, how &s;eldom from education, or private in|&s;truction, they have the advantage of deriving &s;enti|ments of religion or morality. Early obliged to la|bour for their bread, they would remain all their days in gro&s;s ignorance of every moral or &s;acred principle, were it not for tho&s;e public a&s;&s;emblies in which they hear of God, and Chri&s;t, and judgment, and heaven and hell. Shut up tho&s;e temples to which they re&s;ort with reverence; exclude them fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> opportuni|ties they now po&s;&s;e&s;s of receiving religious in&s;truc|tion, and imbibing religious ideas; and what can you expect them to become? no other than a feroci|ous
<PB N="123" REF="028306_0128_0FD880367A8D26A8">rabble, who &s;et free from checks of con&s;cience, and fears of divine vengeance, would be prone to eve|ry outrage which they could commit with impunity. It is well known that, in the early ages of the world, &s;ages and legi&s;lators who endeavoured to &s;ame and a&s;&s;ociate the barbarous hordes of men, &s;ound it nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, to have recour&s;e to religi|on. By bringing the rude multitudes to worthip toge|ther, and at &s;tated times and places, to join in hymns and &s;ongs to their deities, they gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">trained them from violence, and trained them to &s;ubordina|tion and civilized life.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of &s;ociety in after periods, re|ligious a&s;&s;emblies at church continue, I am per&s;uad|ed to have a very con&s;iderable influence on the civil|ization and improvement of the people. Even in|dependent of effect upon their moral pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciples, by leading numbers of them to meet together in an or|derly way, and in their mo&s;t decent appearance, they tend to humanize and poli&s;h their manners. They &s;trengthen the &s;ocial connections, and promote friendly intercour&s;e among tho&s;e who are in the &s;ame neighbourhood, and in the &s;ame lines of life. It mu&s;t at the &s;ame time, be agreeable to every hu|mane mind to think, that one day in &s;even is al|lotted for re&s;t to the poor from their daily labours, and for &s;uch enjoyments of ea&s;e and comfort as their &s;tation affords. It is the only day which gives them occa&s;ion to feel them&s;elves as belonging to the &s;ame cla&s;s of beings with their &s;uperiors; when joining with them in the &s;ame acts of wor&s;hip, and recog|nizing a common Lord. Amid&s;t tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which the difference of ranks nece&s;&s;arily in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oduces into human &s;ociety, it is &s;urely fit that there be &s;ome occa&s;ions when man can meet with man as a brother, in order that the pride of the great may be checked;
<PB N="124" REF="028306_0129_0FD8803842B976C8">and the low may be taught that, if they di&s;charge prop|erly their appointed part, they have rea&s;on to expect, from the Lord of the univer&s;e, the &s;ame rewards with the rich and the mighty.</P>
<P>It will, I believe, be generally admitted that forms of public wor&s;hip, and means of religious in&s;tructi|on, are important, on &s;everal accounts, for the body of the people, and belong to the maintenance of pub|lic &s;afety and order. But many who admit this are apt to think, that to the common people alone they may be left. To per&s;ons of liberal education and enlarged minds, what benefit can ari&s;e from hear|ing what the already know; and what, perhaps, is to be inculcated on them by tho&s;e who are of inferi|or capacity to them&s;elves?&mdash;Admitting this plea of &s;uperiority which their vanity forms, and &s;etting a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent any per&s;onal obligation they are under to wor&s;hip God, I mu&s;t a&s;k &s;uch per&s;ons, how they can expect that religious a&s;&s;emblies will be long re&s;pected by the lower ranks of men, if by men of rank and education they are di&s;countenanced and for|faken? Do not they know, that tho&s;e lower ranks are ready to copy the manners, and to follow the ex|ample of their &s;uperiors in all things; but a&s;&s;uredly in nothing more, than in what appears to &s;et them free from re&s;traint, and to gratify licentiou&s;ne&s;s? While they acknowledge the importance, and even the nece&s;&s;ity, of public religion to certain cla&s;&s;es of men, do they, neverthele&s;s, contribute by their behaviour to defeat the end of public religion, and to annihilate that importance which they a&s;cribe to it?&mdash;They are employed in framing laws and &s;tatutes for prevent|ing crimes, and keeping the di&s;orderly multitude with|in bounds; and at the &s;ame time, by per&s;onally di&s;|countenancing public wor&s;hip, they are weakening, they are even aboli&s;hing, among the multitude, that
<PB N="125" REF="028306_0130_0FD88039CFCC3080">moral re&s;traint, which is of more general influence upon manners than all the laws they frame. In vain they complain of the di&s;hone&s;ty of &s;ervants of the in&s;o|lence of mobs, of the attacks of the highwayman. To all the&s;e di&s;orders they have them&s;elves been acce&s;|&s;ory. By their open di&s;regard of &s;acred in&s;titutions, they have di&s;&s;eminated profligacy among the people. They have broken down the floodgates which &s;erved to re&s;train the torrent; they have let it loo&s;e to over|flow the land; and by the growing deluge may them|&s;elves be &s;wept away.&mdash;But I mu&s;t next argue upon a different ground; and proceed.</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;et forth the importance of the public wor&s;hip of God to every individual, in every rank of life. Whatever his &s;tation be, he is &s;till a man; and has the duties of a man to perform. Were his attend|ance on divine wor&s;hip of no other effect, than to add countenance to a &s;alutary in&s;titution, this alone would render it his duty. But moreover, we a&s;&s;ert it to be his duty on his own account; if it be the duty of eve|ry man to u&s;e the proper means of pre&s;erving and for|tifying his virtue. All the Chri&s;tian in&s;titutions have a direct tendency to this end. They all &s;erve to give warmth to piety, and to add &s;olemnity to moral vir|tue. A very high opinon, indeed, that man mu&s;t have of his own character, who imagines that, a|mid&s;t all the follies and corruptions of the world, he, &s;tands in need of no a&s;&s;i&s;tance for enabling him to act his part with propriety and dignity.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not, whether per&s;ons of rank and education are to learn any thing that is new to them by frequenting the places of public wor&s;hip. The great principles of piety and morality are obvious and ea|&s;ily known; and we &s;hall readily admit, that there are many to whom no new in&s;truction is communi|cated in the hou&s;e of God. But, my friends, the
<PB N="126" REF="028306_0131_0FD8803B43BF4E08">purpo&s;e of your going there is to have known truths recalled to your mind, and their dormant influence awakened; is to have &s;erious meditations &s;ugge&s;t|ed; to have good di&s;po&s;itions rai&s;ed; to have the heart adju&s;ted to a compo&s;ed and tranquil frame. Is there any man of rea&s;on and reflection, who will not ac|knowledge &s;uch effects, as far as they follow from at|tendance on religious ordinances, to be of the mo&s;t beneficial nature? The&s;e occa&s;ional ce&s;&s;ations from the cares and anxieties of life, the&s;e interruptions to the bu&s;tle and pa&s;&s;ions of the world, in order to think and hear of eternity, are both a relief and an improve|ment to the mind. By this retreat from its ordinary circle of thoughts, it is enabled to return, with more clearne&s;s and more vigour, to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, after a &s;erious and proper pau&s;e.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t a&s;k the per&s;ons with whom I now rea&s;on, whether there be no other call to come to God's hou&s;e, than to hear in&s;truction there? Is not the devout adoration of the God of heaven the principal object of our religious a&s;&s;emblies; and is this what any man of reflection, and of &s;ober mind, dare to make light of? In the temple of the Lord, the rich and the poor, the prince and the pea&s;ant, appear as &s;uppliants alike for the protection and favour of the Almighty.&mdash;Great and flouri&s;hing as thou maye&s;t think thy&s;elf, know that thou &s;tande&s;t as much in need of that protection, as the meane&s;t of the crowd whom thou beholde&s;t wor&s;hipping, with lowly reve|rence, the God of their fathers.

<P>But after all that has been urged on this &s;ubject, I am &s;en&s;ible it may be objected, that many who make con&s;cience of paying &s;trict regard to the in&s;titutions of religion, do not appear to have derived much ben|efit from them. They are not, it will be &s;aid, more improved in moral conduct, and the proper di&s;charge of the &s;everal duties of life, than others who have been apparently negligent of the &s;ervices of the church. On the contrary, a formal regard to the&s;e appears to be &s;ub&s;tituted by many, in the room of the weightier matters of the law.&mdash;Though this &s;hould be admitted, it goes no farther than to &s;how that human weakne&s;s, or corruption, may defeat the purpo&s;e of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing means of moral im|provement. That a &s;uper&s;titious attention to exter|nal wor&s;hip, has to often u&s;urped the character, and &s;upplanted the place of real virtue, will not be denied. Admonitions again&s;t &s;o dangerous an error cannot be given too often. But becau&s;e the be&s;t things have been often mi&s;applied and abu&s;ed, no argument thence ari&s;es for their being undervalued, and thrown a&s;ide. So al&s;o rea&s;on, in&s;truction, and di&s;cipline of every kind, have been frequently perverted to bad ends; and yet their intrin&s;ic worth and u&s;efulne&s;s re|main untouched and acknowledged.&mdash;Be&s;ides this, it cannot be admitted that, becau&s;e religious in&s;titu|ted
<PB N="128" REF="028306_0133_0FD8803E4DBC20E8">produce not all they good the might be wi&s;hed, and hoped for, they therefore do no good at all. This were a ra&s;h and ill-&s;ounded conclu&s;ion. If the mor|als of men are not always amended by them as they ought to have been, there is rea&s;on, however to think that they would have been wor&s;e without them. Some check is always given by them to open pro&s;ligacy. Some a&s;&s;i&s;tance is furni&s;hed to good di&s;po&s;itions of heart; at lea&s;t, to decency of manners. Even mo|mentary impre&s;&s;ions of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s made on the thoughtle&s;s by the &s;olemnities of religion, are not without their fruit. They leave generally &s;ome trace behind them; and when the traces are often renewed, they may be hoped, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, to form at la&s;t a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the mind.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I do not &s;ay that religious in|&s;titutions work upon the mind like a charm; and that mere bodily attendance on them will always en&s;ure us of &s;ome profitable effect. Let the means that are employed, for the improvement of rational beings, be ever &s;o powerful in them&s;elves, much of their &s;ucce&s;s will always depend on the manner in which they are received and applied. I &s;hall therefore con|clude my rea&s;onings on this &s;ubject, with a few ob|&s;ervations concerning the di&s;po&s;itions requi&s;ite on our part, for deriving benefit from the public ordinances of religion.</P>
<P>The ends for which we a&s;&s;emble in the hou&s;e of God are two; to wor&s;hip God, and to li&s;ten to relig|ious in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The public wor&s;hip of God is the chief and mo&s;t &s;acred purpo&s;e of every religious a&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;|tians. Let it here be remembered, that it is not the uttering, or the hearing of certain words, that con|&s;titutes the wor&s;hip of the Almighty. It is the heart that prai&s;es, or prays. If the heart accompany not
<PB N="129" REF="028306_0134_0FD88040CA746C10">the words that are &s;poken or heard, we <HI>offer the &s;ac|rifice of fools.</HI> By the inattentive though, and the giddy and wandering eye, we pro&s;ane the temple of the Lord, and turn the appearance of devotion into in&s;ult and mockery. With regard to religious in|&s;truction, attention and reverence are unque&s;tionably due. All religious and moral knowledge comes from God. It is a light from heaven, fir&s;t tran&s;mitted to man by the orginal con&s;titution of his nature, and afterwards made to &s;hine with fairer and fuller lu&s;tre by the revelation of the go&s;pel in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Its brightne&s;s may &s;ometimes be &s;tronger, and &s;ometimes weaker, according to the mediums by which it is con|veyed. But &s;till, as far as the in&s;tructions delivered from the pulpit are illuminated by the ray from hea|ven, they are the truths of God, and ought to be re|ceived as &s;uch. Refinements of vain philo&s;ophy, or intricate &s;ubtilities of theological controver&s;y, are un|doubtedly not intitled to &s;uch regard. But when the great principles of natural or revealed religion are di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed; when the important doctrines of the go&s;pel concerning the life, and &s;ufferings, and death of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer are di&s;played; or u&s;eful in&s;tructions regarding the regulation of life, and the proper di&s;|charge of our &s;everal duties, are the &s;ubjects brought into view; it is not then the human &s;peaker, but the divine authority that is to be regarded.</P>
<P>In the &s;peaker, many imperfections and infirmi|ties may be di&s;covered. The di&s;coveries of the go&s;|pel are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, as a hidden trea&s;ure brought to light; but, by the appointment of God, <HI>we have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor iv. 7.</NOTE> It is not the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity that ought to bring us to church. Too often, is to be feared, we a&s;&s;emble there merely as crities on the preacher; crities on his &s;entiments,
<PB N="130" REF="028306_0135_0FD88042464F18D8">his language, and his delivery. But, &s;uch are not the di&s;po&s;itions which become us on &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;i|on. It is with humility, with fairne&s;s, and candour, with an intention to improve our&s;elves in piety and virtue, with a view to make per&s;onal application to our own character, that we ought to hear the word of God.&mdash;When we enter the &s;acred temple, let us ever con&s;ider our&s;elves as creatures &s;urrounded with darkne&s;s, &s;eeking illumination from heaven; as guil|ty creatures, imploring forgivene&s;s from our judge; as frail and mortal creatures, preparing for that eter|nal habitation into which we know not how &s;oon we are to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If, with &s;uch &s;entiments and impre&s;&s;ions we join in the wor&s;hip of God, and the ordinances of religi|on, we may ju&s;tly hope that they &s;hall be accompani|ed to us with the divine ble&s;&s;ing.

<P>&mdash;The fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO <HI>u&s;e this world</HI> &s;o as not to <HI>abu&s;e it,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t important, and at the &s;ame time one of the mo&s;t difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ons which religion teaches. By &s;o many de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions we are connected with the objects around us, that our attachment to them is al|ways in hazard of becoming exce&s;&s;ive and &s;inful. Hence religion is often employed in moderating this attachment, by rectifying our erroneous opinions, and in&s;tructing us in the proper value we ought to &s;et on worldly things. Such was particularly the &s;cope of the Apo&s;tle in this context. He is putting the Cor|inthians in mind that their <HI>time is &s;hort:</HI> that every thing here is tran&s;itory; and therefore, that in all the different occupations of human life, in <HI>weeping</HI> and <HI>re|joicing,</HI> and <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing,</HI> they were ever to keep in view this con&s;ideration, that <HI>the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> The original expre&s;&s;ion imports, the figure or form under which the world pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us. The meaning is. All that belongs to this vi|&s;ible &s;tate is continually changing. Nothing in human affairs is fixed or &s;table. All is in motion and fluctu|ation;
<PB N="132" REF="028306_0137_0FD89567FA645570">altering its appearance every moment, and pa&s;&s;ing into &s;ome new form. Let us meditate for a little on the &s;erious view which is here given us of the world, in order that we may attend to the improve|ments which it &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The fa&s;hion of the world pa&s;&s;eth away,</HI> as the opi|nions, ideas, and the manners of men are always changing. We look in vain for a &s;tandard to a&s;certain and fix any of the&s;e; in vain expect that what has been approved and e&s;tabli&s;hed for a while, is always to endure. Principles which were of high authority among our ance&s;tors are now exploded. Sy&s;tems of philo&s;ophy which were once univer&s;ally received, and taught and as infallible truths. are now obliterated and forgotten. Modes of living behaving, and employ|ing time, the pur&s;uits of the bu&s;y, and the entertain|ments of the gay, have been entirely changed. They were the offspring of fa&s;hion, the children of a day. When they had run their cour&s;e, they expired; and were &s;ucceeded by other modes of living, and think|ing, and acting, which the glo&s;s of novelty recom|mended for a while to the public ta&s;te.</P>
<P>When we read an account of the manners and oc|cupations, of the &s;tudies and opinions, even of our own countrymen, in &s;ome remote age, we &s;eem to be reading the hi&s;tory of a different world from what we now inhabit. Coming downwards through &s;ome generations, a new face of things appears. Men begin to think, and act, in a different train; and what we call refinements gradually opens. Arriving at our own times, we con&s;ider our&s;elves as having widely enlarg|ed the &s;phere of knowledge on every &s;ide, having form|ed ju&s;t ideas on every &s;ubject; having attained the proper &s;tandard of manners and behaviour; and won|der at the ignorance, the uncouthne&s;s, and ru&s;ticity of our forefathers. But, alas! what appears to us &s;o
<PB N="133" REF="028306_0138_0FD89569948E0DF0">perfect &s;hall in its turn pa&s;s away. The next race, while they &s;hove us off the &s;tage, will introduce their favourite di&s;coveries and innovations; and what we now admire as the height of improvement, may in a few ages hence be con&s;idered as altogether rude and imperfect. As one wave effaces the ridge which the former had made on the &s;and by the &s;ea &s;hore, &s;o eve|ry &s;ucceeding age obliterates the opinions and modes of the age which had gone before it. <HI>The fa&s;hion of the world</HI> is ever pa&s;&s;ing away.</P>
<P>Let us only think of the changes which our own ideas and opinions undergo in the progre&s;s of life. One man differs not more from another, than the &s;ame man varies from him&s;elf in different periods of his age, and in different &s;ituations of fortune. In youth, and in opulence, every thing appears &s;miling and gay. We fly as on the wing of fancy; and fur|vey beauties wherev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> we ca&s;t our eye. But let &s;ome more years have pa&s;&s;ed over our heads, or let di&s;appointments in the world have depre&s;&s;ed our &s;pir|its; and what a change takes place? The plea&s;ing illu&s;ions that once &s;hone before us; the &s;plended fa|bries that imagination had reared; the enchanting maze in which we once wandered with delight, all vani&s;h and are forgotten. The world it&s;elf remains the &s;ame. But its form, its appearance, and a&s;pect, is changed to our view; its <HI>fa&s;hion,</HI> as to us hath <HI>pa&s;&s;ed away.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. While our opinions and ideas are thus chang|ing within, the condition of all external things is, at the &s;ame time, ever changing without us, and a|round us. Wherever we ca&s;t our eyes over the face of nature, or the monuments of art, we di&s;cern the marks of alteration and vici&s;&s;itude. We cannot tra|vel far upon the earth, without being pre&s;ented with many a &s;triking memorial of the changes made by
<PB N="134" REF="028306_0139_0FD8956AF9CF7FE0">time. What was once a flouri&s;hing city, is now a neglected village. Where ca&s;tles and palaces &s;tood, fallen towers and ruined walls appear. Where the magnificence of the great &s;hone, and the mirth of the gay re&s;ounded, there, as the prophet I&s;aiah de&s;cibes, <HI>the owl and the raven now dwell, thorns come up, and the nettle and the bramble grow in the courts.</HI>&mdash;When we read the hi&s;tory of nations, what do we read but the hi&s;tory of ince&s;&s;ant revolution and change? We be|hold kingdoms alternately ri&s;ing and falling; peace and war taking place by turns; princes, heroes, and &s;tate&s;men, coming forth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on the &s;tage, attracting our attention for a little by the &s;plendid figure they make, and then di&s;appearing and forgotten. We &s;ee the <HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> a&s;&s;uming all its differ|ent forms, and in all of them, <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away.</HI></P>
<P>But to hi&s;torical annals there is no occa&s;ion for our having recour&s;e. Let any one, who has made &s;ome progre&s;s in life, recollect only what he has be|held pa&s;&s;ing before him, in his own time. We have &s;een our country ri&s;e triumphant among the nations; and we have &s;een it al&s;o humbled in its turn. We have &s;een in one hemi&s;phere of the globe new domin|ions acquired, and in another hemi&s;phere, our old dominions lo&s;t. At home, we have &s;een &s;actions and parties &s;hift through all their different forms; and ad|mini&s;trations, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ri&s;e and fall. What were once the great themes of eager di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and political conte&s;t, are now forgotten. Fathers recount them to their children as the tales of other times. New actors have come forth on the &s;tage of the world. New objects have attracted the attention, and new intrigues engaged the pa&s;&s;ions of men. New mem|bers fill the &s;eats of ju&s;tice; new mini&s;ters the temples of religion; and a new world, in &s;hort, in the cour&s;e of a few years, has gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly ri&s;en around us.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="028306_0140_0FD8956C9D8B6E48">
When from the public &s;cene we turn our eye to our own private connections, the changes which have taken place in the <HI>fa&s;hion of the world,</HI> mu&s;t touch eve|ry reflecting mind with a more tender &s;en&s;ibility. For where are now, many of the companions of our early years; many of tho&s;e with whom we fir&s;t began the race of life; and who&s;e hopes and pro&s;pects were once the &s;ame with our own? In recollecting our old acquaintance and friends, what deva&s;tations have been made by the hand of time? On the ruins of our form|er connections, new ones have ari&s;en; new relations have been formed; and the circle of tho&s;e among whom we live is altogether changed from what it once was. Comparing our pre&s;ent &s;ituation with our former condition of life; looking back to our father's hou&s;e, and to the &s;cenes of youth; remembering the friends by whom we were trained, and the family in which we grew up; who, but with inward emoti|on, recollects tho&s;e days of former years, and is di&s;|po&s;ed to drop the &s;ilent tear, when he views the <HI>fa&s;hi|on of the world</HI> thus always <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away!</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Not only our connections with all things a|round us change, but our own life, through all its &s;tages and conditions, is ever pa&s;&s;ing away. How ju&s;t, and how affecting is that image, employed in the &s;acred writings to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of man, <HI>we &s;pend our years as a tale that is told!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xc. 9.</NOTE> It is not to any thing great or la&s;ting that human life is compared; not to a moment that is built, or to an in&s;cription that is engraved; not even to a book that is written, or to a hi&s;tory that is recorded; but to a <HI>tale,</HI> which is li&s;tened to for a little; where the words are fugitive and pa&s;&s;ing, and where one incident &s;ucceeds and hangs on another, till, by in&s;en&s;ible tran&s;itions, we
<PB N="136" REF="028306_0141_0FD8956E0259D268">are brought to the clo&s;e; <HI>a tale,</HI> which in &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages may be amu&s;ing, in others, tedious; but wheth|er it amu&s;es or fatigues, is &s;oon told, and &s;oon for|gotten. Thus, year &s;teals upon us after year, Life is never &s;tanding &s;till for a moment; but continually, though in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;liding into a new form. Infancy ri&s;|es up fa&s;t to childhood; childhood to youth; youth pa&s;&s;|es quickly into manhood; and the grey hair and the &s;ad|ed look are not long of admoni&s;hing us, that old age is at hand. In this cour&s;e all generations run. The world is made up of uncea&s;ing rounds of tran&s;itory exi&s;tence. Some generations are coming foward into being, and others ha&s;tening to leave it. The &s;tream which car|ries us all along it ever flowing with a quick current, though with a &s;till and noi&s;ele&s;s cour&s;e. The dwell|ing place of man is continually emptying, and by a fre&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of inhabitants, continually filling anew. <HI>The memory of man pa&s;&s;eth away, like the re|membrance of a gue&s;t who hath tarried but one night.</HI></P>
<P>As the life of man, con&s;idered in its duration, thus fleets and pa&s;&s;es away, &s;o during the time it la&s;ts, its condition is perpetually changing. It affords us noth|ing on which we can &s;et up our re&s;t; no enjoyment or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which we can properly call our own. When we have begun to be placed in &s;uch circum|&s;tances as we de&s;ired, and wi&s;h our lives to proceed in the &s;ame agreeable tenor, how often comes &s;ome unexpected event acro&s;s, to di&s;concert all our &s;chemes of happine&s;s? Our health declines; our friends die; our families are &s;cattered; &s;omething or other is not long of occurring, to &s;how us that the wheel mu&s;t turn round; <HI>the fa&s;hion of the world</HI> mu&s;t <HI>pa&s;s away.</HI> Is there any man who dares to look to futurity with an eye of confident hope; and to &s;ay, that again&s;t a year hence, he can promi&s;e being in the &s;ame condi|tion of health of fortune, as he is at pre&s;ent? The
<PB N="137" REF="028306_0142_0FD8956F7A30ED48">&s;eeds of change are every where &s;own in our &s;tate; and the very cau&s;es that &s;eemed to promi&s;e us &s;ecuri|ty, are often &s;ecretly undermining it. Great fame provokes the attacks of envy and reproach. High health gives occa&s;ion to intemperance and di&s;ea&s;e. The elevation of the mighty never &s;ails to render their condition tottering; and that ob&s;curity which &s;helters the mean, expo&s;es them, at the &s;ame time, to become the prey of oppre&s;&s;ion. So completely is the <HI>fa&s;hion of this world</HI> made by Providence for change, and pre|pared for <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away.</HI> In the mid&s;t of this in&s;tabili|ty, it were &s;ome comfort, did human pro&s;perity decay as &s;lowly as it ri&s;es. By &s;low degrees, and by many interveining &s;teps, it ri&s;es. But one day is &s;ufficient to &s;catter, and bring it to nought. I might add,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the world it&s;elf in which we dwell, the ba&s;is of all our pre&s;ent enjoyments, is it&s;elf contriv|ed for change, and de&s;igned to pa&s;s away. While the generations of men come forth in their turns, like troops of &s;ucceeding pilgrims, to act their part on this globe, the globe on which they act is totter|ing under their feet. It was once overflowed by a de|luge. It is &s;haken by earthquakes; it is undermin|ed by &s;ubterraneous fires; it carries many a mark of having &s;uffered violent convul&s;ions, and of tending to di&s;&s;olution. Revelation informs us, that there is a day approaching, in which <HI>the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s a|way with a great noi&s;e: the elements &s;hall melt with fer|vent heat; and the earth and the works therein &s;hall be burnt up.</HI> When this de&s;tined hour arrives, the <HI>fa&s;h|ion of the world</HI> &s;hall have finally <HI>pa&s;t away.</HI> Immor|tal &s;pirits &s;hall then look back upon this world, as we do at pre&s;ent on cities and empires, which were once mighty and flouri&s;hing, but now are &s;wept from ex|i&s;tence, and their place is no more to be found.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer on this repre&s;entation of
<PB N="138" REF="028306_0143_0FD89571B9D6F220">things. Enough has been &s;aid, to &s;how that the <HI>fa&s;h|ion of the world,</HI> in every &s;en&s;e, <HI>pa&s;&s;es</HI> away. Opin|ions and manners, public affairs and private concerns the life of man, the conditions of fortune, and the earth it&s;elf on which we dwell, are all changing around us.&mdash;Is every thing, then, with which we are connected, pa&s;&s;ing and tran&s;itory? Is the whole &s;tate of man no more than a dream or fleeting vi&s;ion? Is he brought forth, to be only the child of a day? Are we thrown into a river, where all flows, and noth|ing &s;tays; where we have no means of re&s;i&s;ting the current; nor can reach any firm ground, on which to re&s;t our foot?&mdash;No, my brethren; man was not doomed to be &s;o unhappy; nor made by his Creator &s;o much in vain. There are three fixed and perma|nent objects, to which I mu&s;t now call your attention, as the great &s;upports of human con&s;tancy amid&s;t this fugitive &s;tate. Though this world changes and pa&s;&s;|es away, virtue and goodne&s;s never changes; heaven and immortality pa&s;s not away.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Virtue and goodne&s;s never change. Let opinions and manners, conditions and &s;ituations, in public and in private life, alter as they will, virtue is ever the &s;ame. It re&s;ts on the immovable ba&s;is of Eternal Truth. Among all the revolutions of hu|man things it maintains its ground; ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the veneration and e&s;teem of mankind, and conferring on the heart, which enjoys it, &s;atisfaction and peace. Con&s;ult the mo&s;t remote antiquity. Look to the mo&s;t &s;avage nations of the earth. How wild, and how fluctuating &s;oever the ideas of men may have been, this opinion you will find to have always prevai|led, that probity, truth, and beneficence, form the honour and the excellency of man. In this, the phi|lo&s;opher and the &s;avage, the warrior and the hermit, join. At this altar all have wor&s;hipped. Their of|ferings,
<PB N="139" REF="028306_0144_0FD895733AC77C40">many have been un&s;eemly. Their notions of virtue may have been rude, and occa&s;ionally taint|ed by ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition; but the fundamental ideas of moral worth have ever remained the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Here then is one point of &s;tability, affected by no vici&s;&s;itudes of time and life, on which we may re&s;t. Our fortunes may change, and our friends may die; but virtue may &s;till be our own; and as long as this remains, we are never mi&s;erable. <HI>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. My righteou&s;ne&s;s I hold fa&s;t, and will not let it go. My heart &s;hall not reproach me &s;o long as I live.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE> He who, with the holy man of old, can hold this language, may with undi&s;turbed mind &s;urvey time flying away, life decaying, and the whole fa&s;hion of the world changing around him. He hath within him&s;elf, a &s;ource of con&s;olation and hope, independent of all earthly objects. Every terre&s;trial glory &s;parkles only for a little, with tran|&s;ient brightne&s;s. But virtue &s;hines with eternal and unalterable &s;plendour. It derives its origin from heaven; and partakes both of the lu&s;tre, and the &s;ta|bility, of cele&s;tial objects. <HI>It is the brightne&s;s of the everla&s;ting light; the un&s;potted mirror of God, and the image of his goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, God never changes. Amid&s;t the uncea&s;ing vici&s;&s;itude of earthly things, there re|mains at the head of the univer&s;e an eternal protector of virtue, who&s;e <HI>throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</HI> With him there is <HI>no variablene&s;s, neither any &s;hadow of turn|ing;</HI> no incon&s;tancy of purpo&s;e, and no decay of wi&s;|dom or of power. We know that he loved righte|ou&s;ne&s;s from the beginning of days, and that he will continue to love it unalterably to the la&s;t. Fore&s;een by him was every revolution which the cour&s;e of ages has produced. All the changes which happen in the
<PB N="140" REF="028306_0145_0FD89574BA709A10">&s;tate of nature, or the life of men, were comprehend|ed in his decree. How much &s;oever worldly things may change in them&s;elves, they are all united in his plan; they con&s;titute one great &s;y&s;tem or whole, of which he is the Author; and which, at its final com|pletion, &s;hall appear to be perfect. His dominion holds together, in a continual chain, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variety of human events; gives &s;tability to things that in them&s;elves ars fluctuating; gives con&s;tancy even to the <HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> while it is <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away.</HI> Wherefore, though all things change on earth, and we our&s;elves be involved in the general mutability, yet as long as, with tru&s;t and hope, we look up to this Supreme Being, we re&s;t on the <HI>rock of ages,</HI> and are &s;afe amid&s;t every change. We po&s;&s;e&s;s a fortre&s;s to which we can have recour&s;e in all dangers; a refuge under all &s;torms; <HI>a dwelling place in all generations.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t place, heaven and immortality pa&s;s not away. The fleeting &s;cenes of this life are to be confidered as no more than an introduction to a nobler and more permanent order of things, when man &s;hall have attained the maturity of his being. This is what rea&s;on gave &s;ome ground to expect; what revelation has fully confirmed; and in confirm|ing it, has agreed with the &s;entiments and anticipati|ons of the good and wi&s;e in every age. We are taught to believe that what we now behold, is only the fir&s;t &s;tage of the life of man. We are arriv|ed no further than the thre&s;hold, we owell as in the outer courts of exi&s;tence. Here, tents only are pitched; tabernacles erected for the &s;ojourners of a day. But in the region of eternity, all is great, &s;table, and unchanging. There, the <HI>man&s;ions</HI> of the ju&s;t are prepared: there, the <HI>city which hath foundations</HI> is built; there is e&s;tabli&s;hed, the kingdom <HI>which cannot be mo|ved.</HI> Here, every thing is in &s;tir and fluctuation; becau&s;e here good men continue not, but pa&s;s onward
<PB N="141" REF="028306_0146_0FD8957639D1BA30">in the cour&s;e of being. There, all is &s;erene, &s;teady and orderly; becau&s;e there remaineth the final <HI>reft of the people of God.</HI> Here, all is corrupted by our folly and guilt; and of cour&s;e mu&s;t be tran&s;ient and vain. But there, purcha&s;ed by the death, and &s;ecured by the re&s;urrection of the Son of God, is an <HI>inheritance in|corruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI> There reigns the tranquillity which is never troubled. There &s;hines that &s;un which never &s;ets. There flows that river of plea&s;ures, which is always unruffled and pure. Looking forward to tho&s;e divine habitations, the changes of the pre&s;ent world di&s;appear to the eye of faith; and a good man becomes a&s;hamed of &s;uf|fering him&s;elf to be dejected by what is &s;o &s;oon to pa&s;s away.</P>
<P>Such are the objects you ought to oppo&s;e to the tran&s;ient <HI>&s;a&s;hion of the world;</HI> Virtue, and God, and Heaven.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TRANQUILLITY of mind, or, in the words of the text, a mind <HI>not moved</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;quieted by the accidents of life, is undoubtedly one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings that we can po&s;&s;e&s;s on earth. It is here, mentioned as the reward of the man, who&s;e character had been de&s;cribed in this p&s;alm, as leading a virtuous life, and di&s;charging his duty towards God and his neighbour. It is indeed the ultimate aim, to which the wi&s;hes of the wi&s;e and reflecting have ever been di|rected,
<PB N="143" REF="028306_0148_0FD895798E808258">that with a mind undi&s;turbed by anxieties, cares, and fears, they might pa&s;s their days in a plea&s;ing &s;erenity. They ju&s;tly concluded that, by en|joying them&s;elves in peace, they would enjoy, to the greate&s;t advantage, all the comforts of life that came within their reach.</P>
<P>This happy tranquillity, the multitude conceive to be mo&s;t readily attainable by means of wealth, or, at lea&s;t, of an ea&s;y fortune; which they imagine would &s;et them above all the ordinary di&s;turbances of life. That it has &s;ome effect for this purpo&s;e, cannot be de|nied. Poverty and &s;traitened circum&s;tances are of|ten incon&s;i&s;tent with tranquillity. To be de&s;titute of of tho&s;e conveniencies that &s;uit our rank in the world; to be burdened with anxiety about making provi&s;ion for every day which pa&s;&s;es over our head; in&s;tead of bringing comfort to a family who look up to us for aid, to behold our&s;elves &s;urrounded with their wants and complaints, are circum&s;tances which can not fail to give much unea&s;ine&s;s to every feeling mind. To take mea&s;ures, therefore, for attaining a competent fortune, by laudable means, is wi&s;e and proper. En|tire n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ligence of our affairs, and indifference about our worldly circum&s;tances, is, for the mo&s;t part, the con&s;equence of &s;ome vice, or &s;ome folly.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the attainment of opulence is no certain method of attaining tranquilli|ty. Embara&s;&s;ments and vexations often attend it; and long experience has &s;hown, that tranquillity is far from being always found among the rich. Nay, the higher that men ri&s;e in the world, the greater degrees of power and di&s;tinction which they acquire, they are often the farther removed from internal peace. The world affords &s;o many in&s;tances of mi&s;eries abound|ing in the higher ranks of life, that it were needle&s;s to enlarge on a topic &s;o generally known and admit|ted.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="028306_0149_0FD87F81EB38D990">
A&s;&s;uming it, therefore, for an undoubted truth, that the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods of fortune may be con&s;i&s;tent with the want of inward tranquillity, we mu&s;t look around for other more certain grounds of it. We mu&s;t inquire whether any line of conduct can be pointed out, which, independent of external &s;ituation in the world, &s;hall tend to make us ea&s;y in mind; &s;hall either be&s;tow, or aid, that tranquillity which all men de&s;ire. The remaining part of this di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be employed in &s;ugge&s;ting, with great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, &s;uch directions as appear to me mo&s;t material on this important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> direction, which I have to &s;ugge&s;t, is, that we imitate the character of the man who is de&s;|cribed in this p&s;alm as <HI>walking uprightly, working righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaking the truth, as he thinketh in his heart;</HI> that we &s;tudy to pre&s;erve a clear con&s;cience, and to lead a virtuous and honourable, at lea&s;t an in|offen&s;ive and innocent, life. Of &s;uch a man only it can be &s;aid, that <HI>doing the&s;e things be &s;hall never be moved.</HI> So great is the power of con&s;cience over every human being, that the remembrance of crimes never fails to overthrow tranquillity of mind. Be a&s;&s;ured, that he who defrauds his neighbour, who has e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ar|ed the innocent, has violated his tru&s;t, or betrayed his friend, &s;hall never enjoy within him&s;elf undi&s;|turbed quiet. His evil deeds will at times recur to his thoughts, like gho&s;ts ri&s;ing up in black array be|fore him to haunt his couch. Even the &s;en&s;e a fool|i&s;h and trifling conduct, of a life pa&s;t in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation; by which, though a man has not been guilty of great crimes, he has however wa&s;ted his &s;ub&s;tance, mi&s;pent his time, and brought upon him&s;elf ju&s;t reproach; even this, I &s;ay, is &s;ufficient to or the much unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;quiet to the heart.

To this te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, let him be able,</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place to join humble tru&s;t in the favour of God. As, after the be&s;t endeavours we can u&s;e, no man's behaviour will be entirely faultle&s;s, it is e&s;&s;ential to peace of mind, that we have &s;ome ground for hope in the Divine mercy, that through the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our defects &s;hall be forgiven, and grace be &s;hewn us by Heaven. This includes all the duties of faith and repentance that are required by the Go&s;pel; the faithful di&s;charge of which duties is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for delivering us from tho&s;e fears of another world, which, if not allayed, are &s;ufficient to bani&s;h all tranquillity from the heart. Our relig|ious principles mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be &s;ound and pure; and carefully pre&s;erved from the taint of &s;uper|&s;tition, who&s;e gloomy horrors, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of weak and ill-informed minds, convert what they mi&s;take for religion, into a &s;ource of mi&s;ery.&mdash;More|over, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that we be able to place tru&s;t in God, not only as our future Judge, but as the pre&s;|ent Govenor of human affairs. So uncertain is the continuance of every earthly comfort, that he, who repo&s;es no confidence in the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of events, mu&s;t be often di&s;quieted and dejected. He alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es firm tranquillity, who, amid&s;t all hu|man vici&s;&s;itudes, looks up, with &s;ettled tru&s;t, to an almighty Ruler, as to one under who&s;e conduct he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>I have pointed out the primary and e&s;&s;ential foun|dations of tranquillity; virtuous conduct, good prin|ciples, and pious di&s;po&s;itions. At the &s;ame time, a man may be both pious and virtuous, and yet, through &s;ome defects in the management of his mind and temper, may not po&s;&s;e&s;s that happy &s;erenity and &s;elf-enjoyment, which ought to be the portion of virtue and piety. In&s;tances of this will occur to every one who is acquainted with the world. We too often behold per&s;ons, who&s;e principles, and who&s;e moral conduct, are in the main unexceptionable, leading an uncomfortable life; throught fretfulne&s;s of temper, peevi&s;hne&s;s of manners, or &s;ullenne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. There is, therefore, &s;ome di&s;cipline to be &s;tudied; there are &s;ome &s;ub&s;idiary parts of character to be atten|ded to, in order to give piety and virtue their full ef|fect for conferring tranquillity. To the con&s;ideration of the&s;e &s;econdary means I now proceed. Let me then advi&s;e you.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, to attend to the culture and im|provement of your minds. A fund of u&s;eful know|ledge, and a &s;tock of ideas, afford much advantage for the enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not mean, that every man mu&s;t &s;tudy to become deeply learned. The &s;ituation of many would not allow it. The ta&s;te, and the habits of others, prevent it. But what I mean is, that every man who wi&s;hes to lead a comfortable life &s;hould provide for him&s;elf, as much as he can, by means of ob&s;ervation, reading, and reflecting, a large field of u&s;eful thoughts. In a mind ab&s;olutely vacant, tranquillity is &s;eldom found. The vacancy too often will be filled up by bad de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="147" REF="028306_0152_0FD8957E8374AC90">Whereas, the mind of a wi&s;e man is a kingdom to it&s;elf. In his lonely, or melancholy hours, he finds always re&s;ources within him&s;elf, to which he can turn for relief. As there are many occa&s;ions when exter|nal objects afford no plea&s;ure, it is only by being able to re&s;t on the entertainments afforded to him&s;elf by his mind, that any one can pa&s;s his days with &s;elf-enjoyment Let me recommend for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that we be always careful to provide proper employment for our time. Regular indu&s;try and labour, with intervals of ea&s;e, is perhaps the &s;tate mo&s;t conducive of any to tranquillity. If our &s;tation give no call to indu&s;try, it will be profita|ble that we &s;tudy to have &s;ome end or object in view, to which our attention &s;hall be directed. Relaxation from inten&s;e, of ince&s;&s;ant pur&s;uit, is requi&s;ite for com|fort. But if relaxation degenerate into total idlene&s;s, it becomes in a high degree adver&s;e to tranquillity. Every man by his nature, is formed, more or le&s;s, for action. In a mind that is entirely quie&s;cent, and that has no object to put it into motion, in&s;tead of &s;elf-enjoyment, there will be con&s;tant languor, tediou&s;|ne&s;s, and mi&s;ery. Life &s;tagnates in &s;uch a &s;ituation, like a pool of dead waters; and the man becomes a burden to him&s;elf. Violent and dangerous pur&s;uits, which di&s;tract and embroil tho&s;e who are engaged in them. I cannot be under&s;tood to recommend.

It is
<PB N="148" REF="028306_0153_0FD8957FFB8DC5F8">better for the mind to have &s;ome determinate directi|on given it, than to be always left floating, as it were, in empty &s;pace.&mdash;But about whatever objects we are employed, it is &s;till more material to tranquillity that, in the</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> place, we learn to govern our pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e are the mo&s;t frequent di&s;turbers of our peace. Ne|ce&s;&s;ary as their impul&s;e is to give activity to the mind, yet if they are not kept in &s;ubordination to rea&s;on, they &s;peedily throw all things into confu&s;ion. Such of them as belong to the malignant and un&s;ocial cla&s;s, evidently tend to produce vexation and di&s;quiet. A|gain&s;t &s;uffering the&s;e to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, admonition is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary. But I mu&s;t admon|i&s;h you, that even tho&s;e which are accounted of in|nocent nature, and which therefore may lay hold of virtuous minds, if they obtain the entire ma&s;tery, are &s;ufficient to overthrow the tranquillity of life. Let every one, therefore, who values that tranquillity, &s;tudy to retain moderation and &s;elf-command, even in the mid&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;ions which have a fair and bland appearance. He will find that the gratification of any one of them, compen&s;ates not that perpetual &s;la|very to which it will reduce him, when it becomes inordinate.</P>
<P>I have farther to admoni&s;h you, that this &s;elf-com|mand is particularly nece&s;&s;ary in all that relates to habitual temper. Even where &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions are out of the que&s;tion, tho&s;e &s;lighter emotions which ruffle or four the temper, are &s;ufficient, by their frequent re|currence, to poi&s;on all &s;elf-enjoyment. He who would po&s;&s;e&s;s a tranquil &s;tate, mu&s;t, above all things, culti|vate calmne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. He ought e&s;pecially to cultivate it in that &s;ociety, whether do|me&s;tic or &s;ocial, with which he has mo&s;t frequent in|tercour&s;e. We all know, that there are thou&s;ands
<PB N="149" REF="028306_0154_0FD895818AF8FD90">who in pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">d in formal companies, appear to be all gentlene&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s, but who, at home, and among their neare&s;t relations, give vent, with freedom, to the mo&s;t har&s;h and peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions. Such per&s;ons are not likely to enjoy much real com|fort. For it is in the daily and familiar intercour&s;e of life, that temper chiefly exerts its power, either for promoting or for di&s;turbing, the tranquillity of our days. On occa&s;ions when men come clo&s;e&s;t to|gether, if, in&s;tead of meeting in &s;mooth contact, they rub and grate on one another, the feelings produced on both &s;ides are of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive and di&s;plea&s;ing kind. Nothing can be a&s;&s;umed as a more certain ax|iom, than that he who allows either inordinate pa&s;&s;i|ons, or a cro&s;s temper, to govern him, mu&s;t, though he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s all that flouri&s;hing fortune can be|&s;tow, be a &s;tranger to tranquillity.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> place, let me advi&s;e you never to ex|pect too much from the world. High hopes, and florid views, are great enemies to tranquillity. When ra&s;hly indulged, they are con&s;tantly producing di&s;ap|pointments. Their indulgence, in the mean time, occa&s;ions di&s;content with our pre&s;ent f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ion; and he who is di&s;contented cannot be happy. One of the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons, both of religion and of wi&s;dom is, to mod|erate our expectations and hopes; and not to &s;et forth on the voyage of life like men who expect to be always carried forward with a favourable gale. Let your views be &s;uited to your rank and &s;tation in the world; and never &s;oar fanta&s;tically beyond them. Content your&s;elves with &s;ober plea&s;ures, and form your reli&s;h to them. Be thankful when you are free from pain, though you be not in the mid&s;t of high enjoyment, Be &s;atisfied if the path you tread be ea&s;y and &s;mooth, though it be not &s;trewed with flowers. Human life admits not of continued plea&s;ure; nor is it always
<PB N="150" REF="028306_0155_0FD895830C519C38">rendered happy by great exaltation. Remember, that it is a middle region which is the native &s;tation of tranquillity. It neither a&s;pires to tho&s;e heights of the atmo&s;phere where the thunder is formed; nor creeps always on the ground. Affect not, on every occa&s;ion, to put your&s;elves forward. Be content to retire &s;ometimes into the &s;hade; and allow others to take their proper place.&mdash;It will be ea&s;ily &s;een, that I &s;peak not now to the ambitious and a&s;piring; but to tho&s;e who value tranquillity more than &s;plendid appearance in the world.</P>
<P>Such per&s;ons I al&s;o advi&s;e, while they expect not too much from the world, neither, al&s;o, to form too high expectations from the characters of tho&s;e on who&s;e friend&s;hip they re&s;t, and with whom it is their lot to be connected, either in &s;ocial or dome&s;tic rela|tions. If you have looked for perfection any where, you will find your&s;elf di&s;appointed; and the con&s;e|quence of this di&s;appointment will be, that friend|&s;hip will cool, and di&s;gu&s;t &s;ucceed. If you wi&s;h to enjoy comfort in any of your connections, take your fellow-creatures as they are, and look for their imper|fections to appear. You know you have your own; bear with tho&s;e of others, as you expect that they are to bear with you. As no one is without his failings, few al&s;o are void of amiable qualities. Select for your companions, tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t &s;hare of &s;uch qualities; and value them accordingly.&mdash;In a word make the be&s;t of this world as you find it. Reckon both on the &s;tate of human life, and on the &s;ociety of men, as mixed and cheek quered with good and evil. Carrying always in your eye &s;uch views of things, you will be be&s;t formed to tho&s;e equal &s;pirits, and that rea&s;onable di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which make the ba&s;is of tranquillity.

<PB N="151" REF="028306_0156_0FD8958487520600">with the active bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, and to cul|tivate habits of &s;erious thought and recollection. I before advi&s;ed tho&s;e who are not particularly engaged in active life, to form to them&s;elves &s;ome object of pur&s;uit, in order to furni&s;h proper employment to time and thought. But the great multitude of men are in a different &s;ituation. Indu&s;try is required of them; bu&s;ine&s;s and cares pre&s;s; and active pur&s;uits occupy their clo&s;e&s;t attention. He, who, in this &s;ituation, pours him&s;elf fourth ince&s;&s;antly on the world, cannot e&s;cape partaking much of its di&s;turbance and trouble. Amid&s;t bu&s;tle, intrigue, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion, he mu&s;t pa&s;s many an unea&s;y hour. Here an enemy encounters him; there, a rival meets him. A &s;u&s;picious friend alarms him one hour; an ungrateful one provokes him the next. I do not recommend, that for the&s;e rea|&s;ons, he who &s;tudies tranquillity &s;hould retire from all public bu&s;ine&s;s, and for&s;ake the haunts of men. This were the retreat of a monk, not of a good and a wi&s;e man. Tranquillity were too dearly purcha&s;ed by the neglect of tho&s;e duties which belong to a man, and a Chri&s;tian. Nor indeed in ab&s;olute &s;eclu&s;ion from the world is tranquillity ever found. On the contrary, when the human mind is cut off from tho&s;e employ|ments for which it was de&s;igned by nature and Provi|dence, it preys on it&s;elf, and engenders its own mi&s;|ery. Tranquillity is always mo&s;t likely to be attain|ed, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world is tempered with thoughtful and &s;erious retreat. <HI>Commune with your hearts on your bed, and be &s;till.</HI> Leaving this world to it&s;elf, let there be &s;ea&s;ons which you devote to your|&s;elves, and to God. Reflection and meditation allay the workings of many unquiet pa&s;&s;ions; and place us at a di&s;tance from the tumults of the world. When the mind has either been ruffled or ca&s;t down, in in|tercour&s;e with God and heaven we find a &s;anctuary
<PB N="152" REF="028306_0157_0FD89585F9E27B40">to which we can retreat. In the hours of contem|plation and devotion, a good man enjoys him&s;elf in peace. He beholds nobler objects than what worldly men can behold. He a&s;&s;umes a higher character. He li&s;tens to the voice of nature and of God; and from this holy &s;anctuary comes forth with a mind fortified again&s;t the little di&s;turbances of the world. Such habits, therefore cannot be too much recom|mended to the lovers of tranquillity, as powerful &s;ub|&s;idiary means for attaining that happy &s;tate.</P>
<P>I have thus pointed out what appears to me the di&s;|cipline of religion and wi&s;dom for tranquillity of mind. <HI>He that doth the&s;e things &s;hall never be moved.</HI> During the early periods of life, vivid &s;en&s;a|tions of plea&s;ure are the &s;ole objects thought wor|thy of pur&s;uit. Mere ea&s;e and calmne&s;s are de&s;pi&s;ed, as the portion of the aged only and the feeble. Some longer acquaintance with the world, with its di&s;ap|pointed hopes and fallacious plea&s;ures, teaches almo&s;t all men, by degrees, to wi&s;h for tranquillity and peace. But you mu&s;t not imagine, that the&s;e are ble&s;&s;ings which will drop on men of their own accord, as &s;oon as they begin to de&s;ire them. No: the thoughtle&s;s, and the profligate, will ever remain &s;trangers to them. They will remain the &s;port of every accident that oc|curs to derange their minds, and to di&s;turb their life. &mdash;The three great enemies to tranquillity are, Vice, Super&s;tition, and Idlene&s;s: Vice which poi&s;ons and di&s;turbs the mind with bad pa&s;&s;ions; Super&s;tition, which fills it with imaginary terrors; Idlene&s;s, which loads it with tediou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t. It is only by following the path which Eternal Wi&s;dom has pointed out, that we can arrive at the ble&s;&s;ed temple of Tranquillity, and obtain a &s;tation there: By doing, or at lea&s;t endeavouring to do, our duty to God and man; by acquiring a humble tru&s;t in the mercy and
<PB N="153" REF="028306_0158_0FD8958779C513E8">favour of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by cultivating our minds, and properly employing our time and thoughts; by governing our pa&s;&s;ions and our temper; by correcting all unrea&s;onable expectations from the world, and from men; and, in the mid&s;t of world|ly bu&s;ine&s;s, habituating our&s;elves to calm retreat and &s;erious recollection.&mdash;By &s;uch means as the&s;e, it may be hoped, that, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, our days &s;hall flow in a &s;tream as unruffled as the human &s;tate admits. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled &s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t.

<P>HOW many complains do we hear from every quarter, of the mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s that fill the world! In the&s;e the high and the low, the young and the aged, join; and &s;ince the beginning of time, no topic has been more fertile of declamation, than the
<PB N="154" REF="028306_0159_0FD89589F80946A0">vanity and vexation which man is appointe to &s;uffer. But are we certain that this vexation, and this vani|ty, is altogether to be a&s;cribed to the appointment of heaven? Is there no g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to &s;u&s;pect that man him|&s;elf is the chief and immediate author of his own &s;ufferings? What the text plainly &s;ugge&s;ts is, that it is common for men to complain groundle&s;ly of Prov|idence; that they are prone to accu&s;e God for the evils of life, when in rea&s;on they ought to accu&s;e them|&s;elves; and that after their <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> hath <HI>perverted their way,</HI> and made them undergo the con&s;equences of their own mi&s;conduct, they impiou&s;ly <HI>fret in heart again&s;t the Lord.</HI> This is the doctrine which I now purpo&s;e to illu&s;trate, in order to &s;ilence the &s;ceptic, and to check a repining and irreligious &s;pirit. I &s;hall for this end make &s;ome ob&s;ervations, fir&s;t, on the ex|ternal, and next, upon the internal, condition of man; and then conclude with &s;uch &s;erious and u&s;e|ful improvement as the &s;ubject will naturally &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider the external condition of man. We find him placed in a world where he has by no means the di&s;po&s;al of the events that happen. Cala|mities &s;ometimes be&s;al the worthie&s;t and the be&s;t, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is le&s;t them, but to acknowledge and to &s;ub|mit to the high hand of Heaven. For &s;uch vi&s;itations of trial, many good and wi&s;e rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;igned, which the pre&s;ent &s;ubject leads me not to di&s;cu&s;s. But though tho&s;e unavoidable calamities make a part yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and &s;orrows that di&s;tre&s;s human life. A multitude of evils be&s;et us. for the &s;ource of which we mu&s;t look to another quarter. &mdash; No &s;ooner has any thing in the health, or in the circum&s;tances of men, gone cro&s;s to their wi&s;h, than they begin to talk of the unequal di&s;tribution of the good things of this life; they envy
<PB N="155" REF="028306_0160_0FD8958BFAA7CEE0">the condition of others, they repine at their own lot, and fret again&s;t the Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;entiments, one man pines under a broken con&s;titution. But let us a&s;k him, whether he can, fairly and hone&s;tly a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e for this but the unknow decree of heaven? Has he duly va|lued the ble&s;&s;ing of health, and always ob&s;erved the rules of virtue and &s;obriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his plea&s;ures; If now he be only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to com|plain, as if he were &s;uffering unju&s;tly? Were you to &s;urvey the chambers of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, you would find them peopled with the victim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of intem|perance and &s;en&s;uality, and with the children of vici|ous indolence and &s;loth. Among the thou&s;ands who langui&s;h there, you would find the proportion of in|nocent &s;ufferers to be &s;mall. You would &s;ee faded youth, premature old age, and the pro&s;pect of an un|timely grave; to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought tho&s;e evils on them&s;elves; while yet the&s;e martyrs of vice and folly have the a&s;&s;urance to arraign the hard fate of man, and to <HI>fret again&s;t the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But you, perhaps, complain of hard&s;hips of an|other kind; of the inju&s;tice of the world; of the poverty which you &s;uffer, and the di&s;couragements under which you labour; of the cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.&mdash;Be|fore you give too much &s;cope to your di&s;content, let me di&s;ires you to reflect impartially upon your pa&s;t train of life. Have not &s;loth, or pride, or ill temper, or &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, mi&s;led you often from the path of &s;ound and wi&s;e conduct? Have you not been wanting to your&s;elves in improving tho&s;e opportunities which Providence offered you, for bettering and advancing
<PB N="156" REF="028306_0161_0FD8958D7B4FF9A8">your &s;tate? If you have cho&s;en to indulge your hu|mour, or your ta&s;te, in the gratifications of indolence or plea&s;ure, can you complain becau&s;e others, in pref|erence to you, have obtained tho&s;e advantages which naturally belong to u&s;eful labours, and honourable pur&s;uits? Have not the con&s;equences of &s;ome fal&s;e &s;teps, into which your pa&s;&s;ions, or, your plea&s;ures, have betrayed you, pur&s;ued you through much of your life; tanted, perhaps, your character, involved you in embara&s;&s;ments or &s;unk you into neglect?&mdash;It is an old &s;aying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world &s;eldom turns wholly again&s;t a man, unle&s;s through his own fault. <HI>Godline&s;s is,</HI> in general, <HI>profitable un|to all things</HI> Virtue, diligence and indu&s;try, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the &s;ure&s;t road to pro&s;perity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of &s;ucce&s;s is far oftener ow|ing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered in&s;uperable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being fickle and changeable, are di&s;tru&s;ted by all.&mdash;The ca&s;e com|monly is, that men &s;eek to a&s;cribe their di&s;appoint|ments to any cau&s;e, rather than to their own mi&s;con|duct; and when they can devi&s;e no other cau&s;e, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they <HI>fret again&s;t the Lord.</HI> They are doubly unju&s;t towards God. In their pro&s;perity, they are apt to a&s;cribe their &s;ucce&s;s to their own diligence, ra|ther than to God's ble&s;&s;ing; and in their adver&s;ity, they impute their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to his providence, not to their own mi&s;behaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very rever&s;e of this. <HI>Every good and every perfect gift com|eth
<PB N="157" REF="028306_0162_0FD8958F4C370F58">from above;</HI> and of evil and mi&s;ery, man is the author to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public &s;tate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. We &s;ee great &s;ocieties of men torn in pieces by inte&s;tine di&s;|&s;en&s;ions, tumults, and civil commotions. We &s;ee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, again&s;t each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils the&s;e are, to which this mi&s;erable world is expo&s;ed.&mdash;But are the&s;e evils, I be&s;eech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who &s;ent forth &s;laught|ering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with ma&s;&s;acres and blood? Are the&s;e mi&s;eries any other, than the bitter fruit of mens violent and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the turbulence of the people?&mdash; Let us &s;ay them entirely out of the account, in think|ing of Providence; and let us think only of the <HI>fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of men.</HI> Did man controul his pa&s;&s;ions, and form his conduct according to the dictates of wi&s;dom, hu|manity and virtue, the earth would no longer be de|&s;olated by cruelty; and human &s;ocieties would live in order, harmony and peace. In tho&s;e &s;cenes of mi&s;chief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with &s;hame, the picture of his vices, his ig|norance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own <HI>perver&s;ene&s;s;</HI> but let not <HI>his heart fret again&s;t the Lord.</HI>&mdash;From the external condition, let us proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the internal &s;tate of man. It is certain that much di&s;quiet and mi&s;ery may be found there, although his outward condition appear undi&s;|turbed, and ea&s;y. As far as this inward di&s;quietude
<PB N="158" REF="028306_0163_0FD89590807DC738">ari&s;es from the &s;tings of con&s;cience, and the horrors of guilt, there can be no doubt of its being &s;elf-cre|ated mi&s;ery; which it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to im|pute to Heaven. But even, when great crimes, and deep remor&s;e, are not the occa&s;ions of torment, how often is poi&s;on infu&s;ed into the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing con|ditions of fortune, by the follies and the pa&s;&s;ions of the pro&s;perous? We &s;ee them peevi&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s; corrupted with luxury, and enervated by ea&s;e; im|patient of the &s;malle&s;t di&s;appointment oppre&s;&s;ed with low &s;pirits, and complaining of every thing around them. How many <HI>Hamans, Hazaels,</HI> and <HI>Herods,</HI> are there in the world, who, from that they &s;uffer within, pa&s;s their days in more vexation and mi&s;ery, than they who undergo the hard&s;hips of poverty? Dare &s;uch men, in their mo&s;t di&s;contented moments, charge the providence of Heaven with mi&s;eries of their own procuring? Providence had put into their hands the faire&s;t opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing their life with com|fort. But they them&s;elves bla&s;ted every comfort that was offered; and verified the prediction, that <HI>the pro&s;perity of fools &s;hall de&s;troy them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>As it is man's own <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> which ruins his pro&s;|perity, we mu&s;t not omit to remark, that it is the &s;ame cau&s;e which aggravates and embitters his adver|&s;ity. That you &s;uffer from the external afflictions of the world, may often be owing to God's appoint|ment; but when, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e, you al&s;o &s;uf|fer from the di&s;orders of your mind and pa&s;&s;ions, this is owing to your&s;elves; and they are tho&s;e inward di&s;orders which add the &s;evere&s;t &s;ting to external af|flictions. Many are the re&s;ources of a good and a wi&s;e man, under all the di&s;a&s;ters of life. In the mid&s;t of them, it is always in his power to enjoy
<PB N="159" REF="028306_0164_0FD89591F9A90450">peace of mind, and hope in God. He may &s;uffer; but under &s;uffering he will not &s;ink, as long as all is &s;ound within. But when the &s;pirit has been wound|ed by guilt and folly, its wounds open, and bleed afre&s;h, upon every blow that is received from the world. The mind becomes &s;en&s;ible and &s;ore to the &s;lighte&s;t injuries of fortune; and a &s;mall rever&s;e is felt as an in&s;upportable calamity.</P>
<P>On the whole; the farther you &s;earch into human life, and the more you ob&s;erve the manners and the conduct of men, you will be the more convinced of this great truth, that of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which abound in the world, we are the chief authors. Among the multitudes who are, at this day, bewailing their con|dition and lot, it will be found to hold of far the greater part, that they are reaping the <HI>fruit of their own doings; their iniquities are reproving them, and their back&s;lidings correcting them.</HI> Unattainable ob|jects fooli&s;hly pur&s;ued, intemperate pa&s;&s;ions nouri&s;h|ed, vicious plea&s;ures and de&s;ires indulged, God and God's holy laws forgotten; the&s;e, the&s;e are the great &s;courges of the world; the great cau&s;es of the life of man being &s;o embroiled and unhappy. God hath ordained our &s;tate on earth to be a mixed and imper|fect &s;tate. We have our&s;elves to blame for its be|coming an in&s;upportable one. If it bring forth no|thing to us but vexation and vanity, we have &s;own the &s;eeds of that vanity and vexation; and as we have &s;own, we mu&s;t reap.&mdash;I now proceed to make im|provement of tho&s;e truths which we have been con|&s;idering.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let us be taught, to look upon &s;in as the &s;ource of all our mi&s;eries. It may &s;ome|times a&s;&s;ume the gentler names of folly, irregularity, or levity; but under whatever form it appears, it al|ways imports a deviation from that &s;acred law which
<PB N="160" REF="028306_0165_0FD89593C127AB68">ought to regulate our conduct. It is &s;till the <HI>root that beareth gall and wormwood;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxix. 18.</NOTE> and in exact pro|portion to the quantity of this poi&s;onous weed, which we our&s;elves have infu&s;ed into our cup, we mu&s;t ex|pect to drink the waters of bitterne&s;s. If the <HI>fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of man</HI> did not <HI>pervert his ways,</HI> his heart would have no occa&s;ion to <HI>fret again&s;t the Lord.</HI> He would enjoy competent &s;atisfaction in every &s;ituation of life; and under its unavoidable evils, would derive con&s;ola|tion from religion and virtue.&mdash;Indeed, of every evil which we now endure, of tho&s;e evils which we look upon to be the appointment of providence, as well as of others, &s;in is ultimately the cau&s;e; as it was man's revolt from God, which gave ri&s;e original|ly to tho&s;e evils, and which rendered the cha&s;ti&s;ements we undergo, in this &s;tate of di&s;cipline, nece&s;&s;ary, even for the <HI>&s;ons of God.</HI>&mdash;But at pre&s;ent, we confine our ob&s;ervation to tho&s;e mi&s;eries of which men are the immediate procurers to them&s;elves; and from them alone, we find &s;ufficient rea&s;on to con&s;ider &s;in as the capital foe to man; as the great troubler and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urb|er of his life.

<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, let us learn from what has been &s;et forth, one of the mo&s;t awful and important of all truths, the reality of a divine government exer|ci&s;ed over the world. Blind mu&s;t that man be, who di&s;cerns not the mo&s;t &s;triking marks of it, in the doc|trine which has been under our review. If there be a &s;ceptic, who contends, that unre&s;trained liberty in the gratification of de&s;ire is given to man; that in the &s;ight of his Creator, all actions are equal; and that no rule of moral conduct hath been pre&s;cribed, or by any penalty enforced; in order to confute &s;uch a man, we have not recour&s;e to rea&s;onings, but &s;im|ply appeal to plain and obvious facts.

<P>The integrity of the upright &s;hall guide them.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS and &s;in are, in this book of Proverbs. frequently contra&s;ted with each other, and the advantages of the former di&s;played. The righteous man in &s;hown to be <HI>more excellent than his neighbour,</HI> as <HI>the ways in which he walks are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s,</HI> while <HI>the way of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is hard.</HI> Honour is repe&s;ented as attending the one, while &s;hame is the portion of the other. The path of the one leads to life; that of the other to di&s;truction. In the text, an advantage of righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;pecified, which is not commonly attended to, and which &s;ome will not readily allow that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. We are told by the wi&s;e man, that it affords light and direction to conduct, and will prove our be&s;t guide through all the intricacies of life. <HI>The integrity of the upright &s;hall guide them;</HI> or, as it is added, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in a following ver&s;e, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the perfect &s;hall direct his way.</HI> There are many who will admit, that integrity is an amiable quality; that it is entit|led
<PB N="165" REF="028306_0170_0FD8959C7ACBA2C0">to much re&s;pect, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es ought to influ|ence our behaviour; who neverthele&s;s are unwilling to allow it the chief place in the direction of their worldly conduct. They hold, that a certain artful &s;agacity, founded upon knowledge of the world, is the be&s;t conductor of every one, who would be a &s;uc|ce&s;sful adventurer in life; and that a &s;trict attention to integrity, as his only guide, would often lead him into danger and di&s;tre&s;s. In oppo&s;ition to tenets of this kind, I now purpo&s;e to &s;how, that amid&s;t all per|plexities and dangers, there is no guide we can chu&s;e &s;o &s;afe, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful on the whole, as the integ|rity of an upright mind; and that upon every trying occa&s;ion, principles of probity and honour will con|duct a good man through life with more advantage, than if he were to act upon the mo&s;t refined &s;y&s;tem of worldly wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>It will not take much time to delineate the char|acter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and ea&s;ily under&s;tood. He is one, who makes it his con&s;tant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his con&s;cience, point it out to him. He is not guided merely by affections, which may &s;ometimes give the colour of virtue to a loo&s;e and un&s;table character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determins him to &s;teem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is ba&s;e and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence you find him ever the &s;ame; at all times, the tru&s;ty friend, the affectionate relation, the con&s;cientious man of bu&s;ine&s;s, the pious wor&s;hipper, the public &s;pirited citizen. He a&s;&s;umes no borrowed appearance. He &s;eeks no ma&s;k to cover him; for he acts no &s;tudied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art; but he is in truth what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his pur&s;uits,
<PB N="166" REF="028306_0171_0FD8959E03B0EE58">he knows no path but the fair and direct one; and would much rather fail of &s;ucce&s;s, than attain it by reproachful means. He never &s;hows you a &s;miling countenance, while he mediates evil again&s;t you in his heart. He never prai&s;es you among your friends; and then joins in traducing you among your enemies. You will never find one part of his character at vari|ance with another. In his manners, he is &s;imple and unaffected; in all his proceedings, open and con&s;i&s;t|ent.&mdash;Such is the man of integrity &s;poken of in the text. Let us now proceed to &s;how, in what manner, and with what effect, integrity &s;erves for the guide of his life.</P>
<P>Every one, who has begun to make any progre&s;s in the world, will be &s;en&s;ible, that to conduct him|&s;elf in human affairs with wi&s;dom and propriety, is often a matter of no &s;mall difficulty. Amid&s;t that variety of characters, of jarring di&s;po&s;itions, and of interfering intere&s;ts, which take place among tho&s;e with whom we have intercour&s;e, we are frequently at a &s;tand, as to the part mo&s;t prudent for us to chu&s;e. Igno|rant of what is pa&s;&s;ing in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e around us, we can form no more than doubtful conjectures con|cerning the events that are likely to happen. They may take &s;ome turn altogether different from the cour&s;e in which we had imagined they were to run, and according to which we had formed our plans. The &s;lighte&s;t incident often &s;hoots out into import|ant con&s;equences, of which we were not aware. The labyrinth becomes &s;o intricate, that the mo&s;t &s;agaci|ous can lay hold on no clue to guide him through it: He finds him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed, and at a lo&s;s how to act.&mdash;In public and in private life, in managing our own concerns, and in directing tho&s;e of others, the doubt &s;tarted by the Wi&s;e man frequently occurs; <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</HI>&mdash;While
<PB N="167" REF="028306_0172_0FD8959F82311C88">thus fatigued with conjecture, we remain perplexed and undetermined in our choice; we are at the &s;ame time pulled to different &s;ides, by the various emoti|ons which belong to our nature. On one hand, plea&s;ure allures us to what is agreeable; on the other, intere&s;t weighs us down towards what &s;eems gainful. Honour attracts us towards what is &s;plendid; and indolence inclines us to what is ea&s;y. In the con&s;ultations which we hold with our own mind, concerning our conduct, how often are we thus divided within our&s;elves; puzzled by the un|certainty of future events, and di&s;tracted by the con|te&s;t of different inclinations?</P>
<P>It is in &s;uch &s;ituations as the&s;e, that the principle of integrity interpo&s;es to give light and direction. While worldly men fluctuate in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e perplexities which I have de&s;cribed, the virtuous man has one Oracle, to which he re&s;orts in every dubious ca&s;e, and who&s;e deci&s;ions he holds to be infallible: He cou&s;ults his con&s;cience. He li&s;tens to the voice of God. Were it only on a few occa&s;ions that this Oracle could be con&s;ulted, its value would be le&s;s. But it is a mi&s;take to imagine, that its Re&s;pon&s;es are &s;eldom given. Hardly is there any material tran&s;ac|tion whatever in human life, any important que&s;tion, that holds us in &s;u&s;pence as to practice, but the dif|ference between right and wrong will &s;how it&s;elf; and the principle of integrity will, if we li&s;ten to it impartially, give a clear deci&s;ion. Whenever the mind is divided within it&s;elf, con&s;cience is &s;eldom or never neutral. There is always one &s;ide or other to which it leans. There is always one &s;cale of the balance, into which it throws the weight of <HI>&s;ome vir|tue; or &s;ome prai&s;e:</HI> of &s;omething that is <HI>ju&s;t and true lovely, hone&s;t, and of good report.</HI> The&s;e are the forms, which to the ob&s;ervation of the upright man. By
<PB N="168" REF="028306_0173_0FD895A1000DBF88">others they may be un&s;een or overlooked; but in his eye, the lu&s;tre of virtue out&s;hines all other brightne&s;s, Wherever this pole &s;tar directs him, he &s;teadily holds his cour&s;e.&mdash;Let the i&s;&s;ue of that cour&s;e be ever &s;o uncertain; let his friends differ from him in opinion; let his enemies clamour; he is not moved; his pur|po&s;e is fixed. He a&s;ks but one que&s;tion of his heart, what is the mo&s;t worthy and honourable part; what is the part mo&s;t becoming the &s;tation which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the character which he wi&s;hes to bear the expectati|ons which good men entertain of him? Being once decided as to this, he he&s;itates no more. He &s;huts his ears again&s;t every &s;olicitation. He pur&s;ues the direct line of integrity, without <HI>turning either to the right hand or to the left.</HI><Q>It is the Lord who cal|leth. Him I follow. Let him order what &s;eem|eth good in his &s;ight.</Q>&mdash;It is in this manner that the <HI>integrity of the upright</HI> acts as <HI>their guide.</HI></P>
<P>But as, upon a &s;uperficial view, it may appear haz|ardous to place our&s;elves entirely under &s;uch a guide, let us now proceed to con&s;ider what can be &s;aid in de|fence of this plan of conduct, and what advantages &s;erve to recommend it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, I affirm, that the guidance of in|tegrity is the &s;afe&s;t under which we can be placed; that the road in which it leads us is, upon the whole, the free&s;t from dangers. Perfect immunity from dan|ger is not to be expected in this life. We can cho&s;e no path, in which we may not meet with di&s;appoint|ments and misfortunes. Our life, at the be&s;t, is a pilgrimage, and perils &s;urround it. Again&s;t the&s;e perils, the men of the world imagine that craft and dexterity furni&s;h the be&s;t defence; and if, in any in|&s;tance, they over-reach the upright, they con&s;ider it as a manife&s;t deci&s;ion in favour of their plan. But in&s;tead of re&s;ting on a few in&s;tances, let us take an
<PB N="169" REF="028306_0174_0FD895A28843F398">exten&s;ive &s;urvey of the cour&s;e of human affairs. Let us enquire who the per&s;ons are that, in all the differ|ent lines of life, have gone through the world with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and we &s;hall find, that the men of prob|ity and honour form by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the li&s;t; we &s;hall find that men of plain under|&s;tanding, acting upon fair and direct views, have much oftener pro&s;pered, than men of the deepe&s;t policy, who were devoid of principle. How few are the in|&s;tances of per&s;ons who by fidelity, worth, and &s;tead|fa&s;t adherence to their duty, have either lo&s;t their for|tunes, or incurred general di&s;plea&s;ure, in times when human affairs were proceeding in their ordinary train? But how numerous and frequent are the examples of tho&s;e who&s;e pro&s;pects have been bla&s;ted, who&s;e cir|cum&s;tances have been ruined, and their names &s;unk into contempt by vice and di&s;hone&s;ty?</P>
<P>The man of the world aims at higher things, and more rapid &s;ucce&s;s, than the man of moderation and virtue. But at the &s;ame time, he incurs greater ri&s;ques and dangers. No calculation of probabilities can en&s;ure &s;afety to him who is acting a deceitful part. Amid&s;t the unfore&s;een vici&s;&s;itudes of the world, he has to dread, not only di&s;appointment to his plans, but the mi&s;eries al&s;o which detected fallacies may bring on his dead. He walks on the edge of preci|pices, where a &s;ingle fal&s;e &s;tep may be fatal. He fol|lows a wandering light, which, if it fail of guiding him by a &s;hort path to the Palace of ambition, lands him in the pit, or the lake. Whereas he who fol|lows the guidance of integrity, walks in the high road on which the light of the &s;un &s;hines. He &s;ees before him the Habitation of peace to which his &s;teps are directed; and if he be longer of arriving at it, he is
<PB N="170" REF="028306_0175_0FD895A4CDDC6A88">&s;ure of neither wandering far a&s;tray, nor of meeting on his road with any forms of unu&s;ual terror.&mdash; Let it be always remembered that the principle of in|tegrity which directs a good man, is far from exclu|ding prudence in the conduct of life. It implies no improvident or thoughtle&s;s &s;implicity. On the con|trary, it is clo&s;ely connected with true wi&s;dom. A man of enlarged capacity, and exten&s;ive views, is al|ways upright. Craft is merely the &s;upplement of in|ferior abilities. It characterizes a narrow compre|hen&s;ion, and a little mind.&mdash;As the path of integ|rity is on the whole the &s;afe&s;t path of conduct; &s;o,</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, it is unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t honourable. Integrity is the foundation of all that is high in character among mankind. Other quali|ties may add to its &s;plendor; but if this e&s;&s;ential re|qui&s;ite be wanting, all their lu&s;tre fades. Were I drawing the character of one who claimed the admi|ration of the world; and after I had a&s;cribed to him eloquence, valour, and every endowment that is mo&s;t &s;hining and captivating, did I add, that he was a man of too much art to be tru&s;ted, I appeal to every one, whether, by this &s;ingle &s;troke, the whole character would not be &s;unk and degraded? An intere&s;ted and crafty man may perhaps ri&s;e into influence and high &s;tation; he may be a rich and a powerful, but will never be a great, man. He may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared, and exter|nally honoured and courted; but in the &s;ecret thoughts of men he finds no re&s;pect. We all feel, that mag|nanimous &s;entiments cannot dwell in the &s;ame brea&s;t with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and deceit.</P>
<P>He who re&s;ts upon an internal principle of virtue and honour, will act with a dignity and a boldne&s;s, of which they are incapable who are wholly guided by intere&s;t. He is above tho&s;e timid &s;u&s;picions, and cau|tious
<PB N="171" REF="028306_0176_0FD895A6927CBA20">re&s;traints, which fetter and embarra&s;s their con|duct. That firmne&s;s which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rec|titude in &s;pirits, gives vigour and force to his exertions on every great occa&s;ion. It adds double weight to all the abilities of which he is po&s;&s;e&s;t. It even &s;up|plies the place of tho&s;e abilities in which he is defec|tive. They who oppo&s;e him are obliged to honour him. They look up to him with a &s;ecret awe, as to one who moves above them in a &s;uperior &s;phere; re|gardle&s;s of their good or ill opinion, of their prom|i&s;es or their threatenings; like one of tho&s;e cele&s;tial luminaries which holds its cour&s;e through its orbit, without being affected by any commotions among the elements below. Such a man is tru&s;ted, and re|lied upon, as well as e&s;teemed, becau&s;e all know where to find him, and upon what &s;y&s;tem he acts. He at|taches friends and followers to him&s;elf, without court|ing them; and though his progre&s;s towards fame &s;hould be &s;low, and interrupted at fir&s;t by crooked arts, it is neverthele&s;s certain and &s;ure. The public may be mi&s;led for a while, in judging of real merit; but it is &s;eldom unju&s;t at the la&s;t. As per&s;ons continue to come forward to view, and to act their part in trying circum&s;tances, their characters are at length &s;ully a&s;certained; and, almo&s;t always, rated as they de&s;erve. How corrupt &s;oever the world may be, they cannot with hold approbation from him, who&s;e con|duct is marked by unifor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> integrity and honour. Enemies he will have; but the public favours him; the multitude of men wi&s;h him &s;ucce&s;s; and de&s;tine him, in their thoughts, to every &s;tep of his prefer|ment, before he arrives at it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, the plan of conduct, on which the man of integrity proceeds is the mo&s;t comforta|ble; that is, attended with the great at &s;atisfaction in a man's own mind. Amid&s;t the various and per|plexing
<PB N="172" REF="028306_0177_0FD895A7BB994F18">events of life, it is of &s;ingular advantage to be kept free from doubt, as to the part mo&s;t proper to be cho&s;en. He who con&s;ults nothing but worldly intere&s;t mu&s;t, upon every turn of fortune, undergo much painful &s;u&s;pence. He is obliged to li&s;ten with anxious ear to every whi&s;per of report; and upon every new a&s;pect which the face of affairs a&s;&s;umes, mu&s;t &s;tudy how to place him&s;elf in a new po&s;ture of defence. But the man of principle is a &s;tranger to the&s;e inward troubles. His time is not lo&s;t; nor his temper fretted by long and anxious con&s;ultations. One light always &s;hines upon him from above. One path, the path of integrity, always opens clear and di&s;tinct to his view.&mdash;But this is not his only advantage, to be freed from embarra&s;&s;ments, by having placed him|&s;elf under the charge of one con&s;tant guide. He is al&s;o rewarded with the &s;en&s;e of having cho&s;en his guide well and wi&s;ely. He is delivered from all in|ward upbraidings, from all mi&s;givings of mind, from all alarms founded on the dread of di&s;covery and di&s;|grace. A good con&s;cience enables him to look back on the part which he has acted with &s;atisfaction; and to look forward to the i&s;&s;ue which it may bring, with|out concern. It is in the ca&s;e of one i&s;&s;ue only, that the man who acts from worldy intere&s;t can enjoy &s;at|isfaction; that is when his de&s;igns have &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h. But it is the felicity of the man who acts under the direction of integrity, that in every i&s;&s;ue, he has &s;omething to comfort him. Though &s;ucce&s;s has failed him, the con&s;olation re|mains of having done his duty, and &s;tudied to approve him&s;elf to God.</P>
<P>This reference of all his actions to divine appro|bation, furni&s;hes another &s;ource of &s;atisfaction and peace. He looks up, with plea&s;ing hope, to a Pro|tector in the heavens, who <HI>loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and

<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> and la&s;t place, that he who thus pur&s;ues a cour&s;e of integrity, has always in his view the pro&s;|pect of immortal rewards.

But what recompen&s;e can worldly wi&s;dom be&s;tow, comparable to what is promi&s;ed by the go&s;pel to them who, <HI>by patient continuance in well doing, look for glory, honour, and immortality?</HI>&mdash;The recompen&s;e indeed is di&s;tant; but the hope of it is pre&s;ent; and hope is one of the mo&s;t powerful prin|ciples of human action. Let a man be firm in the belief that he is acting under the immediate protec|tion of Heaven, and that through all eternity he &s;hall be rewarded for what he now performs; and, as far as this belief is prevalent, his conduct will be &s;teady

<P>Thus I have endeavoured to &s;how in what manner the <HI>integrity of the upright guides them;</HI> and what the advantages are of placing our&s;elves under its guid|ance. If it be the line of &s;afety, or the line of honour, which we chu&s;e to pur&s;ue; if we con&s;ult our pre&s;ent comfort, or look forward to future rewards; in all the&s;e re&s;pects, the cour&s;e which integrity points out is by far the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>It is a great recommendation of the guidance offered to us by integrity, that it is ea&s;ily under&s;tood by all men. Plans of worldly policy are deep and intricate; and experience &s;hows how often the able&s;t per&s;ons are
<PB N="175" REF="028306_0180_0FD895AD076FA408">mi&s;taken in the mea&s;ures which they adopt for carry|ing them on. But when men's intentions are fair and upright, it will be found, that a moderate &s;hare of under&s;tanding and attention is all that is requi&s;ite, for conducting them&s;elves with &s;afety and propriety. Providence never intended, that the art of living hap|pily in this world &s;hould depend on that deep pene|tration, that acute &s;agacity, and tho&s;e refinements of thought, which few po&s;&s;e&s;s. It has dealt more gra|ciou&s;ly with us; and made happine&s;s to depend on uprightne&s;s of intention, much more than on extent of capacity. For the mo&s;t part, the fir&s;t &s;entiment which &s;trikes a good man, concerning what he ought or ought not to do, is the &s;ounde&s;t, and &s;ugge&s;ts the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;el. When he he&s;itates, and be|gins to deliberate how far his duty, or his honour, can be reconciled to what &s;eems his intere&s;t, he is on the point of deviating into a dangerous path.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, it is of great con&s;equence, that he who &s;eeks to &s;urrender his conduct to the direction of in|tegrity, &s;hould be well apprized of what true integrity requires. Let him guard again&s;t burdening con&s;ci|ence unnece&s;&s;arily; le&s;t a &s;uper&s;titious regard to tri|fles lead him to relax in matters of higher obligation. Let him avoid minute &s;crupulo&s;ity, on the one hand. Let him keep at a di&s;tance from loo&s;e ca&s;ui&s;try, on the other. But when he is &s;atisfied that his con&s;cience has been well informed, let him, without wavering, adhere to its dictates in the whole of his conduct. This will prove the true&s;t wi&s;dom both for this world and the next. For <HI>he who walketh uprightly walketh &s;urely.

<P>&mdash;Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FEW &s;ubjects of religions exhortation are of more general concern than tho&s;e which re&s;pect the di&s;tre&s;&s;es incident to human life. For no &s;ociety, no family, no per&s;on, can expect to be long exempted from them; and when we &s;peak of the pro&s;perous, we can only mean tho&s;e who are more rarely &s;ubject to them than others. Now, under tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, religion performs two offices: It teaches us how we ought to bear them; and it a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in thus bearing them. Materials for both are found in the words of the text, which contain a &s;entiment &s;o natural and ju&s;t, as to carry conviction to every rea&s;onable mind. They were the words of Job, at a time when, to his other calamities, this dome&s;tic affliction was added, that one, who ought to have a&s;&s;uaged and &s;oothed his &s;orrows, provoked his indignation by an impious &s;peech. <HI>Thou &s;peake&s;t,</HI> Job replies, <HI>as one of the fooli&s;h women &s;peaketh: What? &s;hall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil?</HI>&mdash;Three in|&s;tructions naturally ari&s;e from the text: Fir&s;t, That this life is a mixed &s;tate of good and evil: Secondly,
<PB N="177" REF="028306_0182_0FD895B02AE5C7F0">That both the goods and the evils in it proceed from God: And, thirdly, That there are ju&s;t rea&s;ons for our receiving with patience the evils of life, from the &s;ame hand which be&s;tows its goods.</P>
<P N="1">I. This life is a mixed &s;tate of good and evil. This is a matter of fact, which will be denied by none, and on which it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow much illu&s;|tration. It is evident to the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;pection, that nothing here is unallayed and pure. Every man's &s;tate is checquered with alternate griefs and joys, di&s;|appointment and &s;ucce&s;s. No condition is altoge|ther &s;table. No life pre&s;erves always the &s;ame tenor. The vici&s;&s;itudes of the world &s;ometimes bring for|ward the afflicted into comfortable circum&s;tances; and often trouble the joy of the pro&s;perous. This is the train in which human affairs have ever been found to proceed; and in which we may expect them always to go on.</P>
<P>But though this be univer&s;ally admitted in &s;pecula|tion, and often confe&s;&s;ed in di&s;cour&s;e, the misfortune is, that few think of applying it to their own ca&s;e. The bulk of mankind di&s;cover as much confidence in pro&s;perity, and as much impatience under the lea&s;t re|ver&s;e, as if Providence had fir&s;t given them a&s;&s;urance that their pro&s;perity was never to change, and after|wards had cheated their hopes. Whereas, what rea&s;on ought to teach us, is, to adju&s;t our mind to the mix|ed &s;tate in which we find our&s;elves placed; never to pre&s;ume, never to de&s;pair; to be thankful for the goods which at pre&s;ent we enjoy, and to expect the evils that may &s;ucceed.&mdash;Thou ha&s;t been admitted to partake of the fea&s;t of life. Its good things are di&s;|tributed. in various portions, among the gue&s;ts. Thou ha&s;t had thine allotted &s;hare. Complain not, when thy portion is removed. It is not permitted to any, to remain always at the banquet.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="178" REF="028306_0183_0FD895B254E453E0">
II. We are taught by the text, that both the goods and the evils which compo&s;e this mixed &s;tate, come from the hand of God. A little reflection may con|vince us, that, in God's world, neither good nor evil can happen by chance. If there were any one mo|ment, in which God quitted the reins of the univer&s;e, and &s;uffered any power to interfere with his admini&s;tra|tion, it is evident, that from that moment, the mea&s;ures of his government mu&s;t become disjointed and incom|plete. He who governs all things, mu&s;t govern con|tinually; and govern the lea&s;t things as well as the greate&s;t. <HI>He never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps.</HI> There are no void &s;paces, no broken plans, in his admini&s;tra|tion; no ble&s;&s;ings that drop upon us without his in|tention; nor any cro&s;&s;es that vi&s;it us un&s;ent by him. <HI>I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e. I form the light, and create darkne&s;s, I moke peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all the&s;e things.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xlv. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>How it has come to pa&s;s, that this life &s;hould con|tain &s;uch a mixture of goods and evils, and that the mixture too &s;hould be of God's appointment, gives ri&s;e to a difficult inquiry. For how can any thing but what is good proceed from the God of love? Can darkne&s;s i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ource of light? or can it be any &s;atisfaction to the <HI>Father of mercies,</HI> to behold the &s;orrows of creatures whom he has made?&mdash;Here there was room for much perplexity, till revelation inform|ed us, that the mixture of evils in man's e&s;tate is ow|ing to man him&s;elf. Had he continued as God ori|ginally made him, he would have received nothing but good from his Creator. His apo&s;ta&s;y and cor|ruption opened the gates of the taben ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> darkne&s;s. Mi&s;ery i&s;&s;ued forth, and has ever &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e pur&s;ued him. In the pre&s;ent condition of his nature, that mi&s;ery is
<PB N="179" REF="028306_0184_0FD87F83C5306650">partly puni&s;hment, partly trial. He is become inca|pable of bearing uninterrupted pro&s;perity; and by the mixture of evils in his lot, merciful de&s;igns are carri|ed on for his improvement and re&s;toration.</P>
<P>What the text leads us at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider is, the effect that will follow from imitating the exam|ple of Job, and refering to the hand of the Almighty, the evils which we &s;uffer, as well as the good, which we enjoy. Such a reference of the di&s;tre&s;sful events of our life to the appointment of Heaven, not only is a duty which piety requires, but tends al&s;o to miti|gate di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;ugge&s;t con&s;olation. For to dwell, as is too commonly done, upon the in&s;tru|ments and &s;ubordinate means of our trouble, is fre|quently the cau&s;e of much grief, and much &s;in. When we view our &s;ufferings as proceeding merely from our fellow-creatures, the part which they have acted in bringing them upon us, is often more grating than the &s;uffering it&s;elf. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s, perhaps, of an enemy, the treachery of a friend, the ingratitude or in&s;olence of one whom we had much obliged, add weight to a load laid upon us by means &s;o pro|voking. The thoughts of their malignity, or of our own neglect in guarding again&s;t it, &s;erve to poi&s;on the &s;ore. Whereas, if in&s;tead of looking to men, we be|held the cro&s;s as coming from God, the&s;e aggravat|ing circum&s;tances would effect us le&s;s; we would feel no more than our proper burden; we would &s;ubmit to it more patiently; and many re&s;ources would open to us, as &s;hall in a little be &s;hown, from thinking of the hand that lays it on. Had Job, when de&s;poiled of all his &s;ub&s;tance, thought of nothing but the Chal|deans and Sabeans who robbed him, with what vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions would he have been tran&s;ported, and with what eager de&s;ires of revenge tormented? Whereas, con&s;idering them as rods and in&s;truments
<PB N="180" REF="028306_0185_0FD895B3BB239278">only in the divine hand, and receiving the correction as from the Almighty him&s;elf, the tumult of his mind &s;ub&s;ided; and with re&s;pectful compo&s;ure he could &s;ay, <HI>The Lord gave; and the Lord hath taken away: Ble&s;|&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</HI> This leads me,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, and mo&s;t important in&s;truction, ari&s;ing from the text; namely, that there are many rea&s;ons why we, who receive good from the hand of God, &s;hould receive with patience the evils which he is plea&s;ed to inflict. This is &s;trongly con|veyed by that interrogatory form of &s;peech, in which the &s;entiment of Job is expre&s;&s;ed: <HI>What? &s;hall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not re|ceive evil?</HI> In order to unfold all that is contained in this appeal made to every man's con&s;cience, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, that the good things which God has be&s;towed, afford &s;ufficient evidence for our be|lieving, that the evils which he &s;ends, are not cau&s;e|le&s;sly or wantonly inflicted. Did we live in a world which bore the marks of a malicious or cruel govern|or, there might be rea&s;on for di&s;tru&s;ting every &s;tep of his conduct. But in the world which we inhabit, we behold, on the contrary, plain marks of predomi|nant goodne&s;s. We behold the &s;tructure of the uni|ver&s;e, the order of nature, the general cour&s;e of Pro|vidence, obviou&s;ly arranged with a benevolent regard to the welfare of men. All the art and contrivance of which the divine works are full, point to this end; and the more they are explored, create the firmer be|lief, that the goodne&s;s of the Deity gave ri&s;e to the &s;y&s;tem of creation. What is the conclu&s;ion to be thence drawn, but that in &s;uch parts of the divine admini&s;tration as appear to us har&s;h and &s;evere, the &s;ame goodne&s;s continues to pre&s;ide, though exer|ci&s;ed in a hidden and my&s;terious manner?</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="028306_0186_0FD895B53A6D3EB0">
Let me de&s;ire you to con&s;ider, whether, if &s;ome powerful friend had placed you in an opulent and comfortable &s;tation, and, in the general conduct of your affairs, had di&s;covered the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted kindne&s;s, you would not a&s;cribe any occa&s;ional di&s;|couragements you received, to &s;ome unknown rea&s;on or cau&s;e, rather than to his unfaithfulne&s;s or cruelty? Ought not the experience which we have had, and the di&s;covery which all nature affords, of the divine good|ne&s;s, lead us to put a like con&s;truction on the evils which we &s;uffer from a hand that hath &s;o frequently loaded us with good?&mdash;Have we forgotten, in the mid&s;t of our complaints, who brought us unto the light of day; who watched over our helple&s;s infancy; who reared our growing childhood; and through ten thou&s;and &s;urrounding dangers, has been our pro|tector and guardian until this day? How often has he re&s;cued us from &s;ickne&s;s and death, and made our hearts glad with unexpected comforts? Now, that &s;ome cloud is thrown over our pro&s;perity, or &s;ome ble&s;&s;ing withdrawn, in which for a time we had re|joiced, can we imagine that there is no good cau&s;e for this change of his proceeding? Shall we &s;u&s;pect that this nature is entirely altered? <HI>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger &s;hut up his tender mer|cies?</HI> No, let us &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t. <HI>This is my infir|mity; but I will remember the works of the Lord. I will remember the years of the right hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxvii. ix. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;One &s;ignal work of the mo&s;t High, at lea&s;t, let us remember, and rejoice in the remembrance of it; even that final remedy which he has provided for all the evils occa&s;ioned by &s;in, in the redemption of the world accompli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>He who &s;par|ed not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</HI> will
<PB N="182" REF="028306_0187_0FD895B6C978F510">he, in any ca&s;e, wantonly afflict the children of men with &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary &s;orrows? Is not this a proof &s;o &s;atisfactory, &s;o expre&s;s and demon&s;trative, of the gracious purpo&s;es of God, as &s;hould di&s;po&s;e us to take in good part, every thing which proceeds from him? Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, that the good things we receive from God are unde&s;erved, the evils we &s;uffer are ju&s;t|ly merited. Every rea&s;onable per&s;on mu&s;t feel the weight of this con&s;ideration, for producing patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. For, though to &s;uffer at any rate be grievous, yet to &s;uffer unju&s;tly, is doubly galling. Whereas, when one receives a mixed portion, where|of the goods are above his de&s;erts, and the evils below his de&s;erts, to complain, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is unrea&s;on|able; there is no more ground for being thankful. &mdash;All, it is true, have not de&s;erved evil equally. Yet all of us de&s;erve it moreor le&s;s; and to merit good at the hand of the Lord, is what none of us can pretend. At the be&s;t we are but <HI>unprofitable &s;ervants.</HI> Even this is more than we are entitled to claim. For if God were to <HI>enter into judgment</HI> with us, who could &s;tand before him? who could ju&s;tify him&s;elf in his &s;ight? When the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive compare their conduct with God's holy law; when they reflect upon the du|ties they have omitted, and the actual guilt they have contracted, they will find more rea&s;on to accu&s;e them|&s;elves, than to complain of the divine cha&s;ti&s;ements. Whatever innocence any of us may plead, nay, whatever merit we may claim, with re&s;pect to men and the world, we &s;uffer no more than what we de|&s;erve from the Governor of the world; and of his di&s;plea&s;ure, we know that the wrath of man is no other than the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>Not only all of us have done evil, but, what ought to be particularly attended to, God has a ju&s;t title to
<PB N="183" REF="028306_0188_0FD895B84E2C0D40">puni&s;h us for it. Although a man know that he de|&s;erves puni&s;hment, yet he will not allow every one to inflict it. A child will &s;ubmit to his parents, a &s;ervant to his ma&s;ter, a &s;ubject to the magi&s;trate, when he would not bear correction from another hand. But no parent can have &s;o complete a right to author|ity over his children, no ma&s;ter over his &s;ervants, no magi&s;trate over his &s;ubjects, as the Almighty hath over us. When we were born, we brought nothing with us into God's world. During our continuance in it, we have lived on the good things which God was plea&s;ed to lend us; and of which, God and our own con&s;cience know that we have made but a &s;orry improvement. When he thinks proper to take any of them away, no wrong is done us; for they were not ours. To have enjoyed them &s;o long, was a favour. To enjoy them always, was what we neither de&s;erved, nor had any title to ex|pect.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, the good things which at differ|ent times we have received and enjoyed, are much greater than the evils which we &s;uffer. Of this fact, I am &s;en&s;ible it will be difficult to per&s;uade the afflic|ted. But would they weigh, in a fair balance, the whole of their circum&s;tances, they would find it true. Whatever per&s;ons feel at the pre&s;ent, makes &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, as very commonly to ob|literate the memory of all the pa&s;t. When one is op|pre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome painful di&s;ea&s;e in his body, or wrung with &s;ome &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s of mind, every former com|fort, at that moment, goes for nothing. Life is be|held in all its gloom. A dark cloud &s;eems to hang over it; and it is reviled, as no other than a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s and &s;orrow. But this is to be unju&s;t to human life, as well as ungrateful to its author. &mdash;Let me only de&s;ire you to think how many days,
<PB N="184" REF="028306_0189_0FD87F8545488DE8">how many months, how many years, you have pa&s;&s;|ed in health, and ea&s;e, and comfort; how many plea|&s;urable feelings you have had; how many friends you have enjoyed; how many ble&s;&s;ings, in &s;hort, of diff|erent kinds you have ta&s;ted; and you will be forced to acknowledge, that more materials of thank&s;giving pre&s;ent them&s;elves than of lamentation and complaint. &mdash;The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, you will &s;ay, are pa&s;t. But though pa&s;t, ought they to be gone from your remembrance? Do they merit no place, in the comparative e&s;timate of the goods and evils of your &s;tate? Did you, could you expect, that in this mutable world, any tempo|ral joy was to la&s;t for ever? Has gratitude no influence to form your minds to a calm acquie&s;cence in your Benefactor's appointments? What can be more rea|&s;onable than to &s;ay. <Q>Having in former times received &s;o many good things from the hand of God, &s;hall I not now, without murmuring, receive the few evils which it plea&s;es him to &s;end?</Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, not only the goods of life are upon the whole greater than its evils; but the evils which we &s;uffer are &s;eldom, or never, without &s;ome mixture of good. As there is no condition on earth of pure unmixed felicity, &s;o there is none &s;o mi&s;er|able, as to be de&s;titute of every comfort. Entire and complete mi&s;ery, if ever it take place, is of our own procuring, not of God's &s;ending. None but the mo&s;t gro&s;s and atrocious &s;inners can be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to di&s;cover no ray of relief or hope. In the ordi|nary di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life, it is generally our own folly and and infirmity which, upon the lo&s;s of &s;ome one ble&s;&s;ing that we had highly prized, deprives us of &s;atisfaction in all other things. Many of our ca|lamities are purely imaginary, and &s;elf-created; ari|&s;ing from rival&s;hip or competition with others, and from fal&s;e opinions of the importance of objects, to

<P>WHATEVER relates to the behaviour of men in their &s;ocial character, is of great im|portance in religion. The duties which &s;pring from that character, form many branches of the great law of charity, which is the favourite precept of Chri&s;tian|ity. They, therefore, who would &s;eparate &s;uch du|ties from a religious &s;pirit, or who at mo&s;t treat them as only the inferior parts of it, do a real injury to re|ligion. They are mi&s;taken friends of piety, who, under the notion of exalting it, place it in a &s;ort of in&s;ulated corner, disjoined from the ordinary affairs of the world, and the connections of men with one another. On the contrary, true piety influences them all. It acts as a vivifying &s;pirit, which ani|mates
<PB N="189" REF="028306_0194_0FD895C07A5D96E0">and enlivens, which rectifies and conducts them. It is no le&s;s friendly to men than zealous for the ho|nour of God; and by the generous affections which it nouri&s;hes, and the beneficent influence which it exerts on the whole of conduct, is fully vindicated from every reproach which the infidel would throw upon it.&mdash;In this view, I am now to di&s;cour&s;e on the nature and duties of virtuous friend&s;hip, as clo&s;e|ly connected with the true &s;pirit of religion. It is a &s;ubject which the in&s;pired philo&s;opher, who is the author of this book of proverbs, has thought worthy of his repeated notice; and in many pa&s;&s;ages has be|&s;towed the highe&s;t elogiums on friend&s;hip among good men. <HI>As ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, &s;o doth the &s;weetne&s;s of a man's friend by hearty coun&s;el. As iron &s;harpeneth iron, &s;o a man &s;harpeneth the countenance of his friend. Make &s;ure of thy friend; for faithful are the wounds of a friend. A friend loveth at all times; and a brother is born for adver&s;ity. There is a friend that &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother,&mdash;Thine own friend, and thy father's friend,</HI> it is &s;aid in the text, <HI>for&s;ake not.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t begin the &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving, that there are among mankind friend&s;hips of different kinds, or, at lea&s;t, connections which a&s;&s;ume that name. When they are no more than confederacies of bad men, they ought to be called con&s;piracies, rather than friend|&s;hips. Some bond of common intere&s;t, &s;ome league again&s;t the innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting, may have uni|ted them for a time. But they are held together only by a rope of &s;and. At bottom they are all rivals, and ho&s;tile to one annother. Their friend&s;hip can &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer than intere&s;t cements them. Every one looks with a jealous eye on his &s;uppo&s;ed friend; and watches the fir&s;t opportunity to de&s;ert, or to be|tray.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="028306_0195_0FD87F7DDE447960">
Friend&s;hips too there are of a different kind, and of a more re&s;pectable nature, formed by the connection of political parties. It is not, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">haps, on &s;elfi&s;h or crooked de&s;igns that &s;uch friend&s;hips are originally founded. Men have been a&s;&s;ocia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed together by &s;ome public intere&s;t, or general cau&s;e, or for defence a|gain&s;t &s;ome real or imagined danger; and connecti|ons thus formed, often draw men into clo&s;e union, and in&s;pire for a &s;ea&s;on no &s;mall degree of cordial at|tachment. When upon ju&s;t and honourable princi|ples this union is founded, it has proved, on vari|ous occa&s;ions, favourable to the cau&s;e of liberty and good order among mankind. At the &s;ame time, no|thing is more ready to be abu&s;ed than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name of public &s;pirit, and a public cau&s;e. It is a name, un|der which private intere&s;t is often &s;heltered, and &s;el|fi&s;h de&s;igns are carried on. The unwary allured by a &s;pecious appearance; and the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of faction u&s;urps the place of the generous warmth of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is not of &s;uch friend&s;hips, whether of the lauda|ble or the &s;u&s;picious kind, that I am now to di&s;|cour&s;e; but of private friend&s;hips, which grow nei|ther out of intere&s;ted de&s;igns, nor party zeal; but which flow from that &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;itions, that corre&s;ponding harmony of minds, which endears &s;ome per&s;on to our heart, and make us take as much part in his circum&s;tances, fortunes, and fate, as if they were our own. <HI>The &s;oul of Jonathan was knit with the &s;oul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own &s;oul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel xviii. 1.</NOTE> Such friend&s;hips certainly are not unreal; and for the honour of human nature, it is to be hoped are not altogether unfrequent among mankind.&mdash; Happy it is, when they take root in our early years; and are engrafted on the ingenuous &s;en&s;ibility of

Friend&s;hips then contracted, retain to the la&s;t a tenderne&s;s and warmth, &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by friend&s;hips that are formed in the riper periods of life. The remembrance of ancient and youthful connecti|ons melts every human heart; and the di&s;&s;olution of of them is, perhaps, the mo&s;t painful feeling to which we are expo&s;ed here below.&mdash;But at whatever pe|riod of life friend&s;hips are formed, as long as they continue &s;incere and affectionate, they form, undoubt|edly, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we can enjoy. By the plea&s;ing communication of all our &s;entiments which they prompt, they are ju&s;tly &s;aid to double our plea&s;ures, and to divide our &s;orrows. They give a brighter &s;un&s;hine to the gay incidents of life; and they enlighten the gloom of its darker hours. <HI>A faith|ful friend,</HI> it is ju&s;tly and beautifully &s;aid, by one of the Apocryphal writers <HI>is the medicine of life.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vi. 16.</NOTE> A variety of occa&s;ions happe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> when to pour forth the heart to one whom we love and tru&s;t, is the chief comfort, perhaps the only relief, we can enjoy.

<P>Since cordial friend&s;hip is &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing to hu|man life, let us proceed to con&s;ider what duties it re|quires, and by what methods it may be cultivated to mo&s;t advantage. The fundamental qualities of true friend&s;hip are, con&s;tancy and fidelity. Without the&s;e material <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngredients, it is of no value. An incon|&s;tant man is not capable of friend&s;hip. He may per|haps have affections which occa&s;ionally glow in his heart; which excite fondne&s;s for amiable qualities; or connect him with &s;eeming attachment to one
<PB N="192" REF="028306_0197_0FD895C5C0C50968">whom he e&s;teems, or to whom he has been obliged. But after the&s;e feelings have la&s;ted for a little, either fancied intere&s;t alienates him, or &s;ome new object at|tracts him; and he is no longer the &s;ame per&s;on to tho&s;e whom he once loved. A man of this incon&s;tant mind cannot be &s;aid to have any mind at all. For where there is no fixedne&s;s of moral principle, occa|&s;ional feelings are of no value; mind is of no effect; and with &s;uch per&s;ons it is never de&s;irable to have any connection. Where con&s;tancy is wanting, there can be no fidelity, which is the other ba&s;is of friend&s;hip. For all friend&s;hip &s;uppo&s;es entire confidence and tru&s;t; &s;uppo&s;es the &s;eal of &s;ecrecy to be inviolable; &s;uppo&s;es promi&s;es and engagments to be &s;acred; and no advan|tage of our own to be pur&s;ued, at the expen&s;e of our friend's honour. An incon&s;tant man, is de&s;picable. A faithle&s;s man, is ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc;</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing neither con&s;tancy nor fidelity to be altogether wanting, &s;till however friend&s;hip is in haz|ard of &s;uffering from the follies, and unrea&s;onable humours, to which all of us are liable. It is to be regarded as a tender plant in an unfavourable foil, which in order to its flouri&s;hing, requires to be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed and nur&s;ed with care. The following directions may be of u&s;e for promoting its cultivation, and pre|&s;erving it from whatever might be apt to bla&s;t and wither it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let me advi&s;e you not to expect perfection in any with whom you contract friend&s;hip. It holds in general, with re&s;pect to all worldy pur|&s;uits, that the more moderate our expectations are, they are likely to be the more &s;ucce&s;sful. If, in any &s;itu|ation of life, we hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s complete happine&s;s, we may depend on receiving mortifications. If, in any per&s;on, we tru&s;t to find nothing but perfection, we may be a&s;&s;ured that, on longer acquaintance, we
<PB N="193" REF="028306_0198_0FD895C797EC30F8">&s;hall meet with di&s;appointments. In the ca&s;e of friend&s;hip, this admonition is the more nece&s;&s;ary to be given, as a certain warmth and enthu&s;ia&s;m belong to it, which are apt to carry us beyond the bounds of nature. In young minds, e&s;pecially, a di&s;po&s;ition of this kind is often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to take place.

<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, It is material to the pre&s;ervation of friend&s;hip, that openne&s;s of temper and manners, on both hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, be cultivated.

<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> advice which I give is, To cultivate, in all intercour&s;e among friends, gentle and obliging manners.

In tho&s;e &s;maller articles of behaviour, where men are too apt to be carele&s;s, and to indulge their humour without re&s;traint, the real character is often under&s;tood to break forth, and &s;hew it&s;elf. It is by no means enough, that, in all matters of &s;erious intere&s;t, we think our&s;elves rea|dy to prove the &s;incerity of our friend&s;hip. The
<PB N="196" REF="028306_0201_0FD87FAAC53FE710">ordinary tenor of life is compo&s;ed of &s;mall duties and offices, which men have occa&s;ion daily to perform; and it is only by rendering daily behaviour agreeable that we can long pre&s;erve the comforts of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fifth</HI> place, let me caution you not to li&s;ten ra&s;hly to evil reports again&s;t your friends. When up|on proper grounds you have formed a connection, be flow of believing any thing again&s;t the friend whom you have cho&s;en. Remember, that there is among mankind a &s;pirit of malignity, which too often takes plea&s;ure in di&s;turbing the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who appear to enjoy one another. The &s;cripture hath warned us, that there is <HI>a whi&s;perer who &s;eparateth chief friends; there is a fal&s;e witne&s;s who &s;oweth di&s;cord among brethren.</HI> Give not therefore a ready ear to the officious in&s;inu|ations of tho&s;e who, under the gui&s;e of friendly con|cern, come to admoni&s;h you, that you ought to &s;tand on your guard again&s;t tho&s;e whom they &s;ee you di&s;|po&s;ed to tru&s;t. Con&s;ider, whether, under this fair appearance, there may not lurk &s;ome &s;ecret envy and rivalry, or &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ncealed intere&s;t. Cha&s;e not every flying report. Suffer not the poi&s;on of jeal|ou&s;y ea&s;ily to taint your mind, and break your peace. A wide difference there is between that weak credu|lity which allows it&s;elf to be impo&s;ed upon blindly, and that dark and &s;u&s;picious &s;pirit which is always inclined to the evil &s;ide. It forms part of the char|acter of a wi&s;e and good man, that he is not prone to <HI>take up a reproach again&s;t his neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> and la&s;t place, let me exhort you not to de&s;ert your friend in danger or di&s;tre&s;s. Too many there are in the world, who&s;e attachment to tho&s;e they call their friends is confined to the day of their pro&s;perity. As long as that continues, they are, or appear to be, affectionate and cordial. But as &s;oon as their friend is under a cloud, they begin to with|draw,
<PB N="197" REF="028306_0202_0FD87FAD9C314130">and to &s;eparate their intere&s;ts from his. In friend&s;hips of this &s;ort, the heart, a&s;&s;uredly, has ne|ver had much concern. For the great te&s;t of true friend&s;hip, is con&s;tancy in the hour of danger, adhe|rence in the &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;When your friend is calumniated, then is the time, openly and boldly to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e. When his &s;ituation is changed, or his fortunes are falling, then is the time of afford|ing prompt and zealous aid. When &s;ickne&s;s or in|firmity occa&s;ion him to be neglected by others, that is the opportunity which every real friend will &s;eize of redoubling all the affectionate attentions which love &s;ugge&s;ts, The&s;e are the important duties, the &s;acred c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aims of friend&s;hip, which religion and vir|tue enforce on every worthy mind.&mdash;To &s;how your|&s;elves warm, after this manner, in the cau&s;e of your friend commands e&s;teem, even from tho&s;e who have per&s;onal intere&s;ts in oppo&s;ing him. This honourable zeal of friend&s;hip, has, in every age, attracted the ve|neration of mankind. It has con&s;ecrated to the late&s;t po&s;terity the names of tho&s;e who have given up their fortunes, and have even expo&s;ed their lives, in behalf of the friends whom they haved; while ignominy and di&s;grace have ever been the portion of them, who de|&s;erted their friends in the evil day. <HI>Thine own friend for&s;ake not.</HI></P>
<P>Before concluding, it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that the inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ion of the Wi&s;e Man in the text, is accom|panied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion; not only <HI>thine own friend,</HI> but al&s;o, <HI>thy father's friend for&s;ake not.</HI> The&s;e words bring back to our remembrance the days of former years; and &s;ugge&s;t a &s;entiment, which cannot but touch every feeling heart. Thine own friend may be dear; thy father's friend ought to be &s;acred. As long as life remains in any human brea&s;t, the memory of tho&s;e ancient ties &s;hould remain,
<PB N="198" REF="028306_0203_0FD87FAE85385978">which connected us once with our father, and our fa|ther's hou&s;e.&mdash;Thy father has perhaps, long ago, gone down to the du&s;t. But when you recal the in|nocent days of childhood and youth; when you think of tho&s;e family tran&s;actions which once gladdened your hearts; your father's friend in the mid&s;t of the&s;e will ri&s;e to your remembrance. There was a time when you acco&s;ted him with re&s;pect, or looked up to him with fondne&s;s, and was made happy by his kind|ly notice. Does &s;uch a one now &s;urvive, and &s;hall he not receive from you &s;ome portion of filial rever|ence and honour?

<P>I have pointed out &s;ome of the chief duties which belong to virtuous friend&s;hip; and &s;ome of the prin|cipal means by which this &s;acred bond &s;hould be pre|&s;erved unbroken; this holy flame &s;hould be kept a|live in the human brea&s;t.

<P>Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow; for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the&s;e words I purpo&s;e to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ur&s;e of the proper conduct which we ought to ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with re|gard to futurity, amid&s;t the pre&s;ent uncertainties of u&s;e. Time and life are always going on, and to each of us are preparing changes in our &s;tate. What the&s;e may be, whether for the better or for the wor&s;e, we cannot tell; as it hath plea&s;ed the wi&s;dom of Provi|dence, to cover futurity with a veil which no mortal can lift up. In the mean time, none of us can avoid forming de&s;igns, and laying plans, for the time to come. The pre&s;ent-moment is never &s;ufficient to give full employment to the active mind of man, with|out &s;ome excur&s;ions into futurity; and in the&s;e ex|cur&s;ions, the pre&s;ent is often wholly &s;pent. It is therefore of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, that a proper direction be given to the mind, in its employments of thought relating to futurity. Otherwi&s;e, in the pro&s;pects which we take of that unknown region, fal&s;e hopes, or ill-grounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars, &s;hall &s;latter or tor|ment us in vain. <HI>We know not,</HI> as the Wi&s;e Man
<PB N="200" REF="028306_0205_0FD8801027F03E40">Yells, <HI>what a day may bring forth.</HI> It may, very probably, produce &s;omething that we had not looked for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and therefore, in&s;tead of <HI>boa&s;ting our&s;elves of to|morrow,</HI> as the multitude are apt to do, it becomes us to be di&s;ciplined and prepared, for whatever it may bring.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;pend much time in confirming the truth, which is the foundation of the admonition in the text; in proving, either that change and mutabil|ity belong to our pre&s;ent &s;tate, or that the changes of it cannot be fore&s;een by us. The&s;e are truths &s;o obvious and confe&s;&s;ed, that an attempt to confirm them is like proving, that all men are to die. At the &s;ame time, obvious as they are, it were to be wi&s;hed, that the thoughts of men dwelt upon them more. For, by a &s;trange but prevailing deception, it would &s;eem, from the general conduct of mankind, that almo&s;t every one thinks his own ca&s;e an excep|tion from the general law; and that he may build plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with as much confidence on his pre&s;ent &s;ituati|on, as if &s;ome a&s;&s;urance had been given him that it were never to change. Hence it has been often ob|&s;erved by &s;erious per&s;ons, that there is no more gen|eral cau&s;e to which the vices of men can be a&s;cribed, their forgetfulne&s;s of God, and their neglect of duty, than to their pre&s;uming upon the continuance of life, of plea&s;ure, and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Look but a little way, my friends, into your own &s;tate; and you mu&s;t unavoidably perceive that, from the beginning, it has been &s;o contrived by Providence, that there &s;hould be no permanent &s;tability to man's condition on earth. The &s;eeds of alteration are every where &s;own. In your health, life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, con|nections, plea&s;ures, there are cau&s;es of decay imper|ceptibly working; &s;ecretly undermining the founda|tions of what appears to you the mo&s;t &s;table; contin|ally

There needs no great bu&s;tle or &s;tir, no long reparation of events, to overturn what &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ecure, and to bla&s;t what appears mo&s;t flouri&s;hing. A gale of wind ri&s;es on the ocean; and the ve&s;&s;el which carried our friends, or out fortunes, is overwhelmed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the deep. A &s;park of a candle falls by night in &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neglected corner; and the whole &s;ub&s;tance of families is con|&s;umed in flames before the morning.

<P>IN this world, we are placed as companions and a&s;&s;i&s;tants to one another. Depending, for mo&s;t of the comforts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">life, on mutual intercour&s;e and aid, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould be formed to de|&s;ire the company, and to take plea&s;ure in the good will of our fellow. But this &s;ociability of man, though e&s;&s;ential to his pre&s;ent condition, has, like many other good principles, been unhappily warped from its original purpo&s;e; and, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, has proved the cau&s;e of much evil. For, as vice has abounded in every age, it hath propagated it&s;elf much more ea&s;ily by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition. We naturally mould our&s;elves on the pat|tern of prevailing manners; and corruption is com|municated from one to another. By mutually giving and taking, the example of &s;inful liberties, licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;preads and grows; each ju&s;&s;i&s;ies him&s;elf by

No exhortation, therefore, is more nece&s;&s;ary to be frequently given, and to be &s;eriou&s;ly enforced, than that which we receive from the text; <HI>Thou &s;hall not follow a multitude to do evil.</HI></P>
<P>To acquire a full view of any danger to which we are expo&s;ed, is the fir&s;t mea&s;ure to be taken, in order to our &s;afety. Let us then begin the &s;ubject, with con&s;idering how much we are in hazard of being mi&s;&s;ed into vice by the general manners which we be|hold around us.&mdash;No virtue is more nece&s;&s;ary to a Chri&s;tian, but &s;carcely is there any more difficult to be put in practice, than that firmne&s;s of mind which can enable a man to maintain his principles, and to &s;tand his ground again&s;t the torrent of cu&s;tom, fa&s;h|ion and example. Example has upon all minds a &s;e|cret and in&s;inuating influence, even when we our&s;elves are in&s;en&s;ible of its operation. We imperceptibly &s;lide into &s;ome re&s;emblance of the manners of tho&s;e with whom we have frequent intercour&s;e. This often &s;hows it&s;elf, in the mo&s;t indifferent things. But the re&s;emblance is &s;till more readily contracted, when there is &s;omething within our&s;elves, leans to the &s;ame &s;ide which is countenanced by the practice of others. We are always glad to find any apology for indulging our inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions; and the example of the multitude too readily &s;ugge&s;ts that apology. Even be|fore corruption has made great progre&s;s in our hearts, &s;ometimes, mere complai&s;ance and good nature in|cline us to fall in with the ways of others. Some|times,

How great is the danger we incur, when, in times of prevailing vice, all the&s;e principles of imitation and compliance unite togeth|er again&s;t our virtue?</P>
<P>The world is too ju&s;tly &s;aid by &s;cripture, to <HI>lie in wickedne&s;s.</HI> It is a &s;chool wherein every vice is taught, and too ea&s;ily learned. Even from our earli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t child|hood, fal&s;e &s;entiments are in&s;tilled into our minds. We are bred up in admiration of the external &s;how of life. We are accu&s;tomed, as &s;oon as we can un|der&s;tand any thing, to hear riches and honour &s;poken of as the chief goods of men, and propo&s;ed to us as the objects to which our future pur&s;uits ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be di|rected. We &s;ee the mea&s;ures of outward re&s;pect and deference taken from the&s;e alone. Reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion and vir|tue are recommended to us, in a formal manner, by our teachers and in&s;tructors; but all improvements of the mind and heart, are vi&s;ibly placed by the world, in an inferior rank to the advantages of fortune. Vices, that chance to be fa&s;hionable, are treated as &s;light fail|ings; and coloured over, in common di&s;cour&s;e, with tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t and gentle names which expre&s;s no condem|nation. We enter, perhaps, on the world, with good principles, and an aver&s;ion to downright vice. But when, as we advance in life, we become initiat|ed in that my&s;tery of iniquity, which is called, the way of the world; when we meet with deceit and artifice in all ranks of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; when we behold iniqui|ty authori&s;ed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great names, and often rewarded with &s;ucce&s;s and advancement, our original good impre&s;|&s;ions too &s;oon decay. The practice of the multitude renders vice familiar to our thoughts; and gradually wears off the abhorrence with which we once beheld it. We begin to think, that what is &s;o very general,
<PB N="213" REF="028306_0218_0FD895CC8E9F8BA8">cannot be highly criminal. The malignity of &s;in ap|pears dimini&s;hed, by &s;o many being &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers in the re|proach; and in&s;tead of men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s detracting, as they ought to do, from our good opinion of the men, our attachment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the men oftener reconciles us to the vices of which they are guilty.</P>
<P>The countenance which &s;in receives from the practice of the multitude, not only removes the re|&s;traints which are impo&s;ed by mode&s;ty and &s;hame; but &s;uch is the degeneracy of the world, that &s;hame is too often employed again&s;t the cau&s;e of religion and virtue. The ridicule of the giddy and unthinking bears down the conviction of the &s;ober and mode&s;t. Again&s;t their own belief, they appear to adopt the no|tions of the infidel; and again&s;t their own choice, they join in the vices of the libertine; that they may not be reproached as per&s;ons of a narrow mind, and &s;till en&s;laved to the prejudices of education. How much rea&s;on is there to believe that, merely from this timidity of temper, many, who&s;e principles are on the &s;ide of religion and virtue, are neverthele&s;s found <HI>walking in the way of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rs, and &s;etting in the chair of the &s;cornful?</HI>&mdash;Intere&s;t, too often coincides with this weakne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, in tempting &s;uch per&s;ons to follow the multitude. To fall in with the prevail|ing ta&s;te, to &s;uit them&s;elves to the pa&s;&s;ions of the great, or to the humours of the low, with whom they chance to be connected, appears the readie&s;t way to ri&s;e in the world. Hence they are naturally lead to relinqui&s;h the firmne&s;s of an upright character, for that &s;upple and ver&s;able turn, which accomodates it&s;elf to the times, and a&s;&s;umes whatever appearance &s;eems mo&s;t convenient for intere&s;t &mdash;Such are the dangers to which we are expo&s;ed, in times of corruption, of <HI>fol|lowing the multitude to do evil;</HI> dangers of which re|quire our mo&s;t &s;erious attention and care, in order to

<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, Let us remember that the multi|tude are very bad guides; are &s;o far from having a ti|tle to implicit regard, that he who blindly follows them, may be perfumed to err. For prejudice, and pa&s;&s;ion, are known to &s;way the crowd. They are &s;truck by the out&s;ide of things; they inquire &s;uper|ficially, admire fal&s;e appearances, and pur&s;ue fal&s;e goods. Their opinions are for the mo&s;t part ha&s;tily formed, and of cour&s;e are variable, floating, and in|con&s;i&s;tent. In every age, how &s;mall is the number of tho&s;e who are guided by rea&s;on, and calm inquiry? How few do we find, who have the wi&s;dom to think and judge for them&s;elves, and have &s;teadine&s;s to fol|low out their own judgment; Ignorance, and low education, darken the views of the vulgar. Fa&s;hion and prejudice, vanity and plea&s;ure, corrupt the &s;enti|ments of the great. The example of neither, affords any &s;tandard of what is right and wi&s;e. If the phi|lo&s;opher, when employed in the pur&s;uit of truth, finds it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;regard e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices and po|pular opinion, &s;hall we, in the more important inqui|ry after the rule of life, &s;ubmit to &s;uch blind guidance as the practice of the many; e&s;teeming whatever they admire, and following wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ever they lead? Be a&s;&s;ured, that he who &s;ets up the general opinion as the &s;tand|ard of truth, or the general practice as the mea&s;ure of right, is likely, upon &s;uch a foundation to build no other &s;uper&s;tructure except vice and folly.&mdash;If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tice of the multitude be a good pattern for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r opinions &s;urely &s;hould be as good a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for our belief.

Truth and error, virtue and vice, are things of immutable nature. The difference between them is grounded on that ba&s;is of eternal rea&s;on, which no opinions or cu&s;toms of men can effect or alter.

As the practice of the multitude furni&s;hes no ju&s;tifi|cation to the &s;inner, &s;o neither does it afford him any &s;afety. Religion is altogether a matter of per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|cern. God hath delivered to every man the rule of life; and every man mu&s;t think and act for him&s;elf; becau&s;e for him&s;elf he is to an&s;wer.

So far is the number of offenders from furni&s;hing any ground of &s;afety, that it calls more loudly for divine ju&s;tice to interpo&s;e. It is as ea&s;y for the Almighty arm to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ru&s;h a whole guilty &s;ociety, as to puni&s;h a &s;ingle individ|ual; and when the di&s;obedient &s;ubjects of God coun|tenance and &s;trengthen one another in licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing in troops and bands it becomes high time for his government to exert it&s;elf, and let its vengeance forth.&mdash;One could &s;carcely think that any profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tian faith would fancy to him&s;elf any apology from the way of the world, when he knows that the declared de&s;ign of his religion was, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the world, which is &s;aid to <HI>lie in &s;in;</HI> and that Chri&s;t came to call out for him&s;elf <HI>a peculiar people,</HI> who&s;e character it &s;hould be, <HI>not to be conformed to the world, but transformed by the renewing of their minds.</HI>&mdash;So little, indeed, can the practice of the world either ju&s;tify or extenuate vice, that it de|&s;erves our &s;erious con&s;ideration,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, whether there be not &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances, which peculiarly aggravate the guilt of tho&s;e who follow the multitude in evil. Do you not, thereby, &s;trengthen the power of &s;in, and perpetuate the pernicious influence of bad example? By &s;triking off from the corrupted crowd, you might be eminent|ly
<PB N="217" REF="028306_0222_0FD895D3397503D0">u&s;eful. You might animate and recover many, whom weakne&s;s and timidity keep under bondage to the cu&s;toms of the world; whereas, by tamely yield|ing to the current of vice, you render that current &s;tronger for carrying others along; you add weight and &s;tability to the bad cau&s;e; you lend to the multi|tude all the force of your example, for drawing others after them, to the commi&s;&s;ion of evil.&mdash;While you are thus acce&s;&s;ory to the ruin of others, you are, at the &s;ame time, &s;tamping your own character with the foule&s;t and deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of corruption. By &s;ur|rendering your judgment, and your con&s;cience, to the multitude, you betray the rights, and degrade the hon|our, of rational nature. Nothing great or worthy can be expected of him, who, in&s;tead of con&s;idering what is right in it&s;elf, and what part it is fitte&s;t for one in his &s;tation to act, is only con&s;idering what the world will think, or &s;ay of him; what &s;ort of beha|viour will pa&s;s with the faire&s;t &s;how, and be mo&s;t cal|culated to plea&s;e the many. When a man has thus given up the liberty and independence of his mind, we can no longer reckon upon him in any thing. We cannot tell how far he may be carried in vice. There is too much ground to dread, that he will lie, di&s;&s;em|ble, and betray; changing him&s;elf, without &s;cruple, into every &s;hape that will find favour among tho&s;e whom he &s;eeks to gain.&mdash;While this &s;ervility to the world infers ba&s;ene&s;s towards men, it involves al&s;o the highe&s;t imprety towards God. It &s;hows that we yield to the world that reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which is only due to the divine law. We treat the government of the Almighty with &s;corn; as if his precepts de&s;erved to be obeyed, only when they &s;uited the caprice and the follies of the multitude; and were entitied to no regard, as &s;oon as they contradicted the reigning cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of the world.&mdash;While

It will often leave us at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to &s;teer; and, after all our trouble and anxiety to catch the favourable gale, it may on a &s;udden for&s;ake us.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is of the highe&s;t importance to religious conduct, that our minds be filled with &s;uitable conceptions of the attributes of God. They are the foundations of our reverence for him and reverence is the foundation of religion. All the divine perfections are intere&s;ting to man. Almighty power, in conjunction with eternity and Omnipre&s;ence, naturally in&s;pires &s;olemn awe. Infinite Goodne&s;s relieves the mind from that oppre&s;&s;ion which Power alone would produce; and, from our experi|ence of pre&s;ent benefits, and our remembrance of the pa&s;t, creates love, gratitude, and tru&s;t. In the mid|dle between the&s;e, &s;tands the contemplation of divine Wi&s;dom, which conjoins impre&s;&s;ions of awe with tho&s;e of comfort; and while it humbles us into pro|found
<PB N="223" REF="028306_0228_0FD87FA40633A198">&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, encourages, at the &s;ame time our reliance on that <HI>King eternal, immortal, and invi&s;ible,</HI> who is ju&s;tly &s;tiled in the text, <HI>the only wi&s;e God.</HI></P>
<P>Among men, wi&s;dom is a quality entirely differ|ent from cunning or craft. It always &s;uppo&s;es good and fair intention in the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; and imports, that laudible ends are pur&s;ued by proper and ju&s;tifiable means. In like manner, wi&s;dom in the Supreme Being cannot be &s;eparated from the rectitude of his nature. It is, in him, an exertion of benev|olence; and imports, that the purpo&s;es of ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s are carried on and accompli&s;hed, by means the mo&s;t effectual. To meditate on &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;tances in which this divine wi&s;dom is di&s;|played, cannot but be highly favourable to the im|pre&s;&s;ions both of piety, and of virtue.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay, whether the natural, or the moral, world, afford the mo&s;t con&s;picuons and &s;trik|ing di&s;plays of the wi&s;dom of God. Not one, nor many di&s;cour&s;es, nor indeed the &s;tudy and labour of a whole life, were, in any degree &s;ufficient to explore them. Of the proofs of wi&s;dom which the natural world affords. I cannot attempt now to di&s;cour&s;e. Any illu&s;tration of the&s;e would lead to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of a &s;cientific <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind, which more properly belong to the philo&s;opher; and on which philo&s;ophy has often em|ployed it&s;elf, with much utility and honour. I &s;hall only take notice that in proportion as human knowl|edge hath enlarged its &s;phere of a re&s;earch and di&s;co|very, in the &s;ame proportion, hath the wi&s;dom of the Creator &s;truck the minds of all inquirers and ob&s;erv|ers, with the highe&s;t admiration. All nature is in truth a &s;cene of wonders. In the di&s;po&s;ition of the heavenly bodies, and the general arrangement of the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; in the &s;tructure of the earth: in the endle&s;s variety of living creatures that fill it;
<PB N="224" REF="028306_0229_0FD895DC46B56C28">and in the provi&s;ion made for them all, to enable them to fulfil the ends of their being, it is not ea&s;y to determine, whether power, wi&s;dom, or goodne&s;s be mo&s;t con&s;picuous. It belongs not only to <HI>the hea|vens to declare the glory of God, and to the firmament to &s;hew forth his handy-work;</HI> in the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;iderable, as well as in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious works of God, equal marks appear of profound de&s;ign and con&s;ummate art. It has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that there is not a vegetable that grows, nor an in&s;ect that moves but what is &s;ufficient to confound the athei&s;t, and to afford the candid ob&s;erver endle&s;s materials of de|vout adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>When we turn to the moral world, the field of admiration which opens to us is no le&s;s exten&s;ive and &s;triking. I can only mention a few in&s;tances of that exqui&s;ite wi&s;dom which every where meet us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let us attend to the con&s;titution of human nature. Though we are taught by revelati|on, to con&s;ider it as now impaired by the fall, yet, as it &s;tands, we behold the traces of a noble &s;tructure planned and executed with the highe&s;t &s;kill. All the powers and faculties be&s;towed on man are &s;uch, as perfectly &s;uit is condition, and adapt him to the pur|po&s;es for which he was de&s;igned.&mdash;Sen&s;es were given him, that he might di&s;tingui&s;h what is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation and welfare of his body. Now, &s;uppo&s;e that any one of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, the &s;ight, for in|&s;tance, or the hearing, or the touch, had been in a con|&s;iderable degree either more blunt, or more acute, than it is at pre&s;ent, what an unhappy change would this have made upon our &s;tate? On the one hand, great|er imperfections of the organs, would have deprived us of all the comfort and advantage which we now en|joy from &s;uch powers. On the other hand, a great|er, degree of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility in them, would have
<PB N="225" REF="028306_0230_0FD895DDBA91C640">rendered life a burden to us. Our &s;en&s;es, in&s;tead of being inlets to knowledge and plea&s;ure, would then have become con&s;tant avenues to unea&s;ine&s;s and pain. Their powers therefore, are &s;kilfully adju&s;ted to that mea&s;ure of &s;trength, which allows them to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of health, &s;afety, and comfort; without ei|ther falling &s;hort of this line of u&s;efulne&s;s, or improp|erely, and hurtfully, &s;tretching beyond it.</P>
<P>In the mind, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions were placed, as the moving powers of the &s;oul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o impel its activity. But as their impul&s;e required regulation and re&s;traint, rea&s;on was, at the &s;ame time, conferred as the direc|ting power.&mdash;Of all our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;elf-love, and the de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation were, with the utmo&s;t pro|priety, made the &s;tronge&s;t, for a rea&s;on which the meane&s;t capacity may comprehend. Every man is mo&s;t immediately committed by P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">widence to his own care and charge. He knows his own &s;ituation be&s;t; and has more opportunities of promoting his own happine&s;s, than he can have of advancing the happine&s;s of any other per&s;on. It was therefore fit and wi&s;e, that, by the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tinct, he &s;hould be prompted to attend to him&s;elf.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, as no man &s;tanding alone is &s;ufficient for his own wel|fare, it was nece&s;&s;ary that, by mutual &s;ympathy and &s;ocial in&s;tincts, we &s;hould be drawn to give aid to one another. Here it de&s;erves our particular notice that the force of tho&s;e &s;ocial in&s;tincts is, with admi|rable propriety, proportioned by Providence to the degree of their u&s;efulne&s;s and importance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. X. Vol. ii.</NOTE> Thus that parental affection, which the helple&s;s &s;tate of in|fancy and childhood renders &s;o needful, is made the &s;tronge&s;t of them all. Next, come tho&s;e ties of blood, which prompt mutual kindne&s;s among tho&s;e
<PB N="226" REF="028306_0231_0FD895DF4AF6CEF8">who are intimately joined together by brotherhood, and other family connections. To the&s;e &s;ucceeds that valuable in&s;tinct of pity which impels us to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, wherever we behold them. To take part with others in there good fortune belongs to man's &s;ocial nature, and increa&s;es the &s;um of happi|ne&s;s. At the &s;ame time, to take part with the pro&s;per|ous is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than to &s;ympathi&s;e with the un|happy; and therefore the principle which prompts us to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice,</HI> is made not to be &s;o &s;trong, as that which impels us to <HI>weep with them that weep.</HI></P>
<P>But they are not only the laudable and important parts of our di&s;po&s;ition, which di&s;cover the wi&s;dom of the Author of our frame; even our imperfections and follies, are by him rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to u&s;eful ends.&mdash;Amid&s;t tho&s;e inequalities of condition, for in|&s;tance, which the &s;tate of human life required, where it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be rich, and others poor, that &s;ome &s;hould be eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed, and others ob&s;cure and mean, how &s;ea&s;onable is that good opinion which every one entertains of him&s;elf; that &s;elf-complacency with which he compares him|&s;elf to others; and that fond hope, which is ever plea&s;ing him with the pro&s;pect of future plea&s;ures and advantages in life? Without tho&s;e flattering &s;en&s;a|tions, vain as they often are, how totally in&s;upporta|ble would this world become, to many of its inhabit|ants?

One in&s;tance of Divine wi&s;dom, in framing our nature, is &s;o remarkable as to demand particular atten|tion; that is, the mea&s;ure according to which God hath di&s;pen&s;ed knowledge and ignorance to man. There is nothing of which we are more ready to com|plain, than of our narrow and confined views of na|ture, and of Providence, and of all things around us: And yet, upon examination, it will be found, that our views extend, on every &s;ide, ju&s;t as far as they ought; and that, to &s;ee and know more than is al|lowed us, in&s;tead of bringing any advantage, would produce certain mi&s;ery.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i. and Serm. IX. Vol. iv.</NOTE>&mdash;We pry, for in&s;tance with impatient curio&s;ity, into future events. Hap|pily for us, they are veiled and covered up; and one peep behind that veil, were it permitted, would be &s;uf|ficient to poi&s;on the whole comfort of our days, by the anticipation of &s;orrows to come.&mdash;In like man|ner, we often wi&s;h with eagerne&s;s to penetrate into the &s;ecrets of nature, to look into the invi&s;ible world, and to be made acquainted with the whole de&s;tiny of man. Our wi&s;h is denied; we are environed on all hands with my&s;tery; and that my&s;tery is our happi|ne&s;s. For were tho&s;e great invi&s;ible objects fully di&s;|clo&s;ed, the &s;ight of them would confound and over|whelm us. It would either totally derange our feeble faculties; or would engro&s;s our attention to &s;uch a degree, as to lay us a&s;ide from the bu&s;ine&s;s, and con|cerns of this world. It would have the &s;ame effect, as if we were carried away from the earth, and ming|led among the inhabitants of &s;ome other planet.&mdash;The knowledge that is allowed to us, was de&s;igned to fit us for acting our part in our pre&s;ent &s;tate. At the exact point therefore, where u&s;efulne&s;s ends, know|ledge &s;tops, and ignorance commences. Light &s;hines
<PB N="228" REF="028306_0233_0FD895E245F78EB0">upon us, as long as it &s;erves to guide our path; but for&s;akes us, as &s;oon as it becomes noxious to the eye; and &s;alutary darkne&s;s is appointed to clo&s;e the &s;cene.&mdash;Thoughtle&s;s and &s;tupid mu&s;t that man be, who, in all this &s;urniture of the human mind, in this exact adju&s;tment of its &s;everal powers to the great purpo&s;es of life, di&s;cerns not the hand of adorable Wi&s;dom, as well as of infinite Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, Let us contemplate the &s;ame wi&s;|dom as exhibiting it&s;elf to us in the moral government of the world. We are informed by revelation, that this life is de&s;igned by Providence to be an introductory part of exi&s;tence to intelligent beings; a &s;tate of edu|cation and di&s;cipline, where creatures fallen from their original rank, may gradually recover their rec|titude and virtue. Under this view, which is in it|&s;elf perfectly con&s;onant to all that rea&s;on di&s;covers, we &s;hall find the general cour&s;e of human affairs, con|fu&s;ed as it may &s;ometimes appear, to have been or|dered with exqui&s;ite wi&s;dom.&mdash;It was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch a &s;tate, that all the active powers &s;hould be brought forth into exerci&s;e, and completely tried. It became proper, therefore, that there &s;hould be a mixture of characters in the world; and that men &s;hould be &s;hewn in a variety of &s;ituations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. iv.</NOTE> Hence that diver&s;ity of tempers and di&s;po&s;itions which are found in &s;ociety; tho&s;e inequalities in rank and &s;tation, which we &s;ee taking place; and tho&s;e different talents <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, which prompt men to different pur|&s;uits. By the&s;e means, every department in &s;ociety is filled up? and every man has &s;ome &s;phere prepared for him, in which he can act. He is brought forth as on a bu&s;y &s;tage, where opportunity is given for his character to di&s;play it&s;elf fully.&mdash;His life is, with
<PB N="229" REF="028306_0234_0FD895E3BA29E868">great propriety, varied by interchanges of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity. Always pro&s;perous he would become, di&s;&s;ipated, indolent, and giddy: Always afflicted, he would be fretful dejected, and &s;ullen. There are &s;ew per&s;ons, therefore, or none, who&s;e lot &s;hares not of both the&s;e &s;tates; in order that every di&s;po&s;ition of the heart may be explored, and every mean of improve|ment afforded.&mdash;As man is ultimately de&s;igned for a higher &s;tate of exi&s;tence than the pre&s;ent, it was not proper that this world &s;hould prove a paradi&s;e to him or &s;hould afford him that complete &s;atisfaction which he ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ues. Di&s;appointments, therefore, are often made to bla&s;t his hopes; and, even while the comforts of life la&s;t, they are always mixed with &s;ome troubles; in order that an exce&s;&s;ive attachment to this world may gradually be loo&s;ened. The cour&s;e of things is evidently &s;o ordered by Providence, that occurrences &s;hall be always happening, to bring down the mo&s;t pro&s;perous to a level with the re&s;t of his brethren, and to rai&s;e up, in their turn, the low and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes, which are &s;o ob|viou&s;ly conducive to improvement, both wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s required, that the &s;upreme Governor of the world &s;hould be &s;een to protect the intere&s;ts, and fa|vour the &s;ide of virtue. But in the degree of evidence, with which this was to be &s;hown, it was no le&s;s re|qui&s;ite, that a proper temperament &s;hould be ob&s;erv|ed. Had virtue been always completely rewarded, and made happy on earth, men would no longer have had a motive for a&s;piring to a more ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate. In the ca&s;e of every crime, had divine ju&s;tice interpo&s;ed to bring complete puni&s;hment on the head of the crim|inal; or had all the felicity which is prepared for the ju&s;t in a future world, and all the mi&s;ery which there awaits the wicked, been already di&s;played to the view,
<PB N="230" REF="028306_0235_0FD895E53A5C23C8">and rendered &s;en&s;ible to the feelings of men, there would have been an end of that &s;tate of trial, for which our whole condition on earth was intended. It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that, at pre&s;ent, we &s;hould <HI>&s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly.</HI> A certain degree of my&s;tery and ob&s;curity was, with perfect wi&s;dom, left on the conduct of the Almighty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i.</NOTE>&mdash;But, amid&s;t that ob&s;cu|rity, &s;ufficient encouragement and &s;upport is in the mean time given to virtue; &s;ufficient ground is afford|ed for the full belief, that it is what the Deity loves, and will finally reward. His approbation of it is &s;ignified to every man by the voice of con&s;cience. In|ward &s;atisfaction and peace are made always to belong to it; and general e&s;teem and honour, for the mo&s;t part, to attend it. On the other hand, the wicked, in no &s;ituation of life, are allowed to be truly happy. Their vices and their pa&s;&s;ions are made to trouble their pro&s;perity; and their puni&s;hment to grow out of their crimes. Let any one attentively recollect the material incidents of his life; and he will, for the mo&s;t part, be able to trace the chief misfortunes which have befallen him, to &s;ome guilt he has con|tracted, or &s;ome folly he has committed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XIII. Vol. iii.</NOTE> Such is the profound wi&s;dom with which Providence conducts its coun&s;els, that, although is does not appear to in|terpo&s;e, men are made to reap from their actions, the fruits which they had de&s;erved; their iniquities <HI>to correct them, and their back&s;lidings to reprove them;</HI> and while they &s;uffer, they are forced to acknowledge the ju&s;tice of their puni&s;hment.&mdash;The&s;e are not mat|ters of rare or occa&s;ional ob&s;ervation; but deeply in|terwoven with the texture of human affairs. They di&s;cover a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ular plan, a formed &s;y&s;tem, according to which the whole train of Providence proceeds;
<PB N="231" REF="028306_0236_0FD895E6CE3F00D0">and which manife&s;ts to every &s;erious ob&s;erver the con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom of its Author.&mdash;As thus, in the con&s;titution of human nature, and in the moral gov|ernment of the world, divine wi&s;dom &s;o remarkably appears, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, That in the redemption of the world, and in the economy of grace, it &s;hines no le&s;s con&s;picuou&s;ly. The &s;ubject which opens to us here is too exten&s;ive to be fully illu&s;trated at pre&s;ent; but the great lines of it are obvious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. V. Vol. i.&mdash;Serm. XX. Vol. i.&mdash;Serm. XXIII. Vol. ii. Serm. V. Vol. iii.</NOTE>&mdash;In carrying on a plan, by which forgivene&s;s was to be di&s;pen&s;ed to an offending race, wi&s;dom required that the author|ity of the legulator &s;hould be fully pre&s;erved, and no &s;uch relaxation be introduced into government as might give licen&s;e or encouragement to offen|ders. Accordingly, the mo&s;t admirable provi&s;ion was made for the&s;e important purpo&s;es, by the inter|po&s;ition of the Son of God &s;uffering and dying for &s;inners. The &s;overeign awe of ju&s;tice is maintained, while ju&s;tice is tempered with mercy. Men are bound to righteou&s;ne&s;s, under the highe&s;t &s;anctions; and am|ple &s;ecurity and con&s;olation are, at the &s;ame time, afforded to the penitent. By the in&s;tructions, and example, of their Saviour, they are in&s;tructed in their duty; and through a Mediator and Interce&s;&s;or, they are encouraged to offer their wor&s;hip and prayers to the Almighty. They are a&s;&s;ured that, in whatever is too ardous for human nature to perform, they &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Divine Spirit; and under all trials and difficulties, they are &s;ported by the expre&s;s promi&s;e of that eternal life, which is brought to light by the go&s;pel.&mdash;It is not po&s;&s;ible for the under&s;tanding to con|ceive any method of &s;alvation, planned with more good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="232" REF="028306_0237_0FD895E839ACCD10">and executed with more wi&s;dom, than what is &s;hown in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. The con&s;ideration of this con&s;titution alone, gives us full rea&s;on to join in that exclamation of the Apo&s;tle: <HI>O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and the knowledge of God! How un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this &s;hort &s;urvey which we have taken of Di|vine wi&s;dom, as di&s;covering it&s;elf, in the whole com|plex frame of the moral world; in the con&s;titution of human nature; in the government of human af|fairs; and in the redemption of the human race; we cannot but perceive how much rea&s;on we have to pro&s;|trate our&s;elves before God, and with all humility to wor&s;hip and adore.&mdash;When we view that immen&s;e &s;tructure of the univer&s;e in which we dwell; when we think of Him, who&s;e wi&s;dom has planned the whole &s;y&s;tem of being; who&s;e mind comprehends, who&s;e coun&s;els direct, the whole cour&s;e of events, from the beginning to the end of time; by whom nothing is &s;o incon&s;iderable as to be overlooked, or &s;o tran&s;ient as to be forgotten; who attends to the con|cerns of the poor man in his cottage, while he is &s;teer|ing the &s;un and the moon in their cour&s;e through the heavens; into what a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;elf-annihila|tion do we fall! Before him all our boa&s;ted knowledge is ignorance, and our wi&s;dom is folly. Wherever we ca&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eyes on his works and ways, we find all things adju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>number, weight, and mea&s;ure;</HI> and after all that we can &s;urvey, Lo! the&s;e are but a part of his ways; and <HI>how &s;mall a portion is heard of him!</HI></P>
<P>It is the power of God, which produces among the multitude of men any impre&s;&s;ions of religion. When thunder roars in the heavens, or an earthquake &s;hakes the ground, they are &s;truck with awe, and di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="233" REF="028306_0238_0FD895EAA6614970">to wor&s;hip an invi&s;ible power. But &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of Deity are occa&s;ional, and tran&s;itory. The la&s;ting reverence of a Supreme Being ari&s;es, in a well in|formed mind, from the di&s;play of that infinite wi&s;|dom which all the univer&s;e pre&s;ents. Its operations are con&s;tantly, though &s;ilently, going on around us. We may view it in the peaceful and &s;edate &s;tate of the univer&s;e, as well as in its greate&s;t commotions; we behold it in every in&s;ect that moves on the ground, at the &s;ame time that we admire it in the revolutions of the cele&s;tial bodies. Happy for us, if the con|templation &s;hall nouri&s;h that temper of habitual de|votion, which &s;o well becomes dependent beings, and is &s;o intimately connected with all virtue!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XXVII. Vol. ii.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the chief effect that ought to be produced by meditation on the divine wi&s;dom, is perfect re&s;igna|tion to the Governor of the univer&s;e, and entire tru&s;t in his admini&s;tration. Our private misfortunes and di&s;|appointments are too often the &s;ubject of queru|lous complaints, and even of unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions of Providence. But when in the whole natu|ral and moral world, we behold an arrangement of things which plainly di&s;covers the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, can we believe, that in the arrangement of our petty concerns, this wi&s;dom is dormant and ne|glectful? How much more rea&s;on is there to think, that our ignorance of the divine plans mi&s;leads our judgment, than that the wi&s;dom of the Almighty has erred in directing our private affairs.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ine wi&s;|dom, as I ob&s;erved in the beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> exertion of divine benevolence.

<PB N="334" REF="028306_0239_0FD895ED2BE6C500" MS="y">Let every new di&s;covery of divine wi&s;dom, be a new ground of hope, of joy, and of cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to every virtuous man. Let him be thankful that he lives in a world, were nothing happens to him by chance, or at random; but where a great, a wi&s;e, and beneficent Mind continually &s;uperintends every event.</P>
<P>Under the faith of this great principle of religion, let us proceed in the cour&s;e of our duty, with &s;tead|fa&s;t and undi&s;mayed mind. Let us retain faithful al|legiance to our Creator and our Redeemer; and then we may always hope the be&s;t; and <HI>ca&s;t our care upon him who careth for us.
