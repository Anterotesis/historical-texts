<P>LEAVING apologies for my inability to act the part I am to take, in this day's &s;olemnity, to tho&s;e who might have remedied the evil by a more &s;uitable appointment&mdash; I &s;hall offer my &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject with the &s;ame free|dom that I conceived them.&mdash;</P>
<P>The advantages of &s;ocial Life, are the re&s;ult of &s;uch evident nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o exten&s;ively diffu&s;ive and univer&s;ally felt, that all Mankind will readily acknowledge their exi&s;tence without the aid of metaphy&s;ics or hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The right that every individual has to rea&s;on freely upon the nature of that government he is called to &s;ubmit to, having nature for its &s;ource, is no le&s;s obvious and perceptable&mdash;and hence as a nece&s;&s;ary foundation for the exerci&s;e of this right, I define civil li|berty to be, not "a government by laws" made agreeable to char|ters, bills of rights or compacts, but a power exi&s;ting in the people at large at any time, for any cau&s;e, or for no cau&s;e, but their own &s;o|vereign plea&s;ure, to alter or annihilate both the mode and e&s;&s;ence of any former government, and adopt a new one in its &s;tead.</P>

<P>Every military force mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily imply a right of exerci|&s;ing an arbitrary power, &s;o far as re&s;pects the objects again&s;t which it is to be directed; and what will be the objects again&s;t which it will be in con&s;tant exerci&s;e in proportion to its extent, we may collect from the experience of ages, and the well-known &s;ource of human actions.</P>
<P>The page of hi&s;tory &s;eldom groans with the calamities of man|kind, but we may trace the &s;ource of their unhappine&s;s to this engine of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Projected in the blacke&s;t principles of the human mind, and &s;upported by ambition and a lu&s;t of unbounded &s;way, this <HI>armed mon&s;ter</HI> hath &s;pread havock and mi&s;ery throughout the world&mdash; We find the bloody traces of its foot&s;teps through all the ruins of greatne&s;s, and freedom, either in ancient or modern times: the mo&s;t free and opulent cities of the world, by conniving at its birth, have at la&s;t fallen a prey to its relentle&s;s fury.

<P><PB N="7" REF="015363_0006_0F98D347444BC6F8">
While we are ravi&s;hed with the politene&s;s, wi&s;dom and great|ne&s;s of the <HI>Grecian</HI> &s;tates, we can &s;carce believe that the producti|ons of &s;uch art, refinement and learning, &s;hould ever be &s;ubdued by a power that never could have crept into life, but through the channel of <HI>their</HI> indulgence.</P>
<P>But alas! their fate remains a &s;tanding MONUMENT of this truth, that freedom at &s;ufference is a &s;olaci&s;m in politics.</P>
<P>To avoid the pain that humanity mu&s;t &s;uffer, upon finding &s;o few in&s;tances of virtue that have been proof again&s;t the temp|tations to pro&s;titute a delegated power&mdash;I am inclined to think&mdash; that the great FOUNDER of &s;ocieties has cau&s;ed the CURSE of infatuating ambition and relentle&s;s cruelty to be entailed on tho&s;e who&s;e vanity may lead them to a&s;&s;ume <HI>his</HI> prerogative among any of his people as they are cantoned about in the world, and to prevent mankind from paying that adoration and re&s;pect to the mo&s;t dignified mortal, which is due only to <HI>infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s</HI> in the direction of <HI>Almighty power,</HI> and therefore that he alone is fit to be a MONARCH.</P>
<P>Were we to traver&s;e the whole field of human tran&s;actions, and expect any where to find an exemption from this general charge, we &s;hould mo&s;t naturally fix our eyes upon the Romans&mdash;But how mortified do we find our&s;elves by the &s;urvey?</P>
<P>At the very time this people were mo&s;t famed for their virtue and greatne&s;s,&mdash;while they were regaling them&s;elves with luxu|rious
<PB N="8" REF="015363_0007_0F98D34803F6FBF0">ea&s;e in the lap of freedom&mdash;the provinces they obtained by fraud and violence were &s;uffering under every &s;pecies of the vile&s;t &s;ervitude, and made to contribute to that very ea&s;e and luxury at the di&s;cretion of the mo&s;t mercile&s;s unfeeling ta&s;k-ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>But they them&s;elves, by the &s;ame tools they had armed to execute their bloody purpo&s;es, in their turn, became the &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kind of oppre&s;&s;ion they &s;o liberally dealt out to others, and &s;tand recorded in hi&s;tory equal monuments of the greatne&s;s and depravity of human nature.</P>
<P>Taught by the experience of former ages&mdash;that a general at the head of an armed force would ever make him&s;elf &s;uperior to the laws, Europe for &s;everal centuries rai&s;ed effectual barriers again&s;t the danger (and I may &s;ay the po&s;&s;ibility) of their u&s;ur|pations&mdash;for the tenure
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The feudal tenure.</NOTE> of their lands though they acknowledge a &s;uperior lord, was upon conditions &s;o abhorrent to the idea of &s;tanding armies, that it offered at once both a promi&s;e and a pledge again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But to convince us that no human in&s;titutions can in&s;ure per|manent felicity to mankind;&mdash;<HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> the offspring of ea&s;e and freedom, opened the door for one enterpri&s;ing u&s;urper after ano|ther,

Strange Metamorpho&s;is!&mdash;But is it not much &s;tranger &s;till, to &s;ee the&s;e pitable wretches &s;tript of every enjoyment that can render life a ble&s;&s;ing, meanly courting favour of protection from the tyrants who en&s;laved them, and ea&s;ily mi&s;taken the <HI>chains of &s;ervitude</HI> for the <HI>garbe of nature?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>formalities</HI> of a <HI>free</HI> and the ends of a <HI>de&s;potic</HI> State (&s;ays a modern writer) have often &s;ub&s;i&s;ted together.&mdash;Britain furni&s;hes a mo&s;t unhappy example of this &s;hocking truth:&mdash;As if the reli&s;h of liberty was pampered to make &s;lavery it&s;elf more intolerably loath|&s;ome, they feel all the mortifying con&s;equences of the ba&s;e&s;t &s;ervi|tude, and are left to con&s;ole them&s;elves with this con&s;ideration, that the weight of their grievances can never be encrea&s;ed, while they are <HI>complimented,</HI> or rather <HI>tantalized</HI> with the name of <HI>Free men.</HI> The&s;e are &s;ome of the glorious effects of &s;tanding armies among <HI>foreign nations.</HI> Let us now con&s;ider their con&s;equences in that part of the world, in who&s;e affairs we take a more intere&s;ting part.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive that tho&s;e men who would not &s;cruple to make u&s;e of every arti&s;ice and violence to reduce the very people to who&s;e genero&s;ity they were indebted for their &s;plendor, wealth and greatne&s;s, to a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, would never he&s;itate to make their conque&s;ts as exten&s;ive as their power,&mdash;they can feel the influence of no <HI>law</HI> but that of the <HI>&s;word,</HI> and therefore (whatever may be their pretentions) you will in every ca&s;e find them ultimately make an appeal to its deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>If &s;uch are the <HI>governors</HI> what mu&s;t the <HI>people</HI> be? Having been robbed of liberty them&s;elves, without the fainte&s;t &s;truggle

<P>How can we expect that they who know nothing of the happine&s;s of freedom them&s;elves &s;hould feel any reluctance at reducing all mankind to their own di&s;graceful &s;ituation? Indeed the rever&s;e is true, for we generally find them taking an unnatural plea&s;ure, in &s;triping others of the noble&s;t ornaments and gifts of nature to coun|tenance their own deformity and wretchedne&s;s:&mdash;</P>
<P>A trifling farce therefore, upon the que&s;tion of <HI>right</HI> in parlia|ment, was all the previous parade that was thought nece&s;&s;ary to the introduction of a &s;tanding army, with all the en&s;igns of war into the bowels of our country.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to recount the various preludes to ho&s;tilities, the fatal day we now commemorate, opened a &s;cene that filled every hone&s;t mind with indignation, and every tender heart with di&s;tre&s;s.
