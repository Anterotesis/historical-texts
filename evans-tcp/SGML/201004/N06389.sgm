<P>&mdash; I have written unto you, young Men, becau&s;e ye are &s;trong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have over|come the wicked one.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is ob&s;ervable, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in the preceeding Ver&s;es, addre&s;&s;es his Exhortations and Admonitions to the Chri&s;tians, to whom he directs this Epi&s;tle, under the &s;everal Titles or Appellati|ons of <HI>Fathers, Young Men,</HI> and <HI>Little Children;</HI> which Titles, or Characters, &s;ome under&s;tand as re&s;pecting the Diver&s;ity of the Degrees of Grace, that obtain among Chri&s;tians, who according to their Standing and Proficiency in the School of Chri&s;t, are variou&s;ly deno|minated, in Allu&s;ion to the natural Age; &s;ome, <HI>Fathers,</HI> from their Age and Experience in Chri&s;tianity, their Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of ancient Things; &s;ome, <HI>Young Men,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="008104_0004_102E2B9C90287D68">from their &s;piritual Strength, and Fortitude, fitting them for Conflicts with <HI>Satan</HI>'s Temptations, and for obtaining the Victory over them; &s;ome, <HI>Little Children,</HI> from their knowing God as a Father.&mdash;Others conceive the&s;e Di&s;tinctions to refer to the Diver&s;ity of the natural Age. And it is generally agreed, that the Words may be aptly accommodated to both Sorts, either to the &s;everal Ranks of Chri&s;tians, differing from each other in Regard of their Growth in Chri&s;tian Knowledge, and Holine&s;s, as Fathers, young Men and Babes in Chri&s;t; or to the Diver&s;ity or Di&s;tinction of Chri&s;tians with Re&s;pect to their natural Age. And it is without all Doubt, that the Holy Scrip|tures in general (as well as this Epi&s;tle) were written for the U&s;e and Benefit of Chri&s;tians, in common, of what|ever Rank or Age of human Life, old, or young. And there are in the Word of God Coun&s;els, In&s;tructions, and Encouragements, peculiarly adapted to Per&s;ons of every Age, particularly to young Men; they are coun&s;elled and exhorted to <HI>remember</HI> their <HI>Creator in the Days of</HI> their <HI>Youth,</HI> (Eccl. 12.1.) and caution'd again&s;t <HI>walking in the Ways of</HI> their <HI>Heart, and in the Sight of</HI> their <HI>Eyes.</HI> (Chap. 11.9.) <HI>Solomon</HI> declares it his De&s;ign in writing his <HI>Proverbs, to give unto the young Man Knowledge and Di&s;cretion.</HI> (<HI>Prov.</HI> 1.4.) And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in&s;tructs <HI>Titus</HI> to give proper Advices to the Aged and Youth; par|ticularly to <HI>exhort young Men to be &s;ober-minded.</HI> (Tit. 2.6.) There are al&s;o Examples of pious young Men &s;et before them for their Encouragement and Imitation. Such was <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Family. (Gen. 39.2,&mdash;9.) Such was <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> who, <HI>in the Eighth Year of his Reign, while he was yet young</HI> (about the Sixteenth Year of his Age, for he <HI>began to reign, when he was Eight Years old) began to &s;eek after the God of David his Father.</HI> (2 Chron. 34.1, 3.) Such was <HI>Obadiah,</HI> who <HI>feared the Lord from his Youth,</HI> (1 King. 18.12.) and others that might be named. And they were young Men in Age ('tis probable) as well as in Grace, to whom this Addre&s;s is made by the Apo&s;tle, giving them a
<PB N="3" REF="008104_0005_102E2B9E1CC77268">great Commendation for their &s;piritual Fortitude, in op|po&s;ing and vanqui&s;hing Satan, that <HI>Wicked one,</HI> thro' the Word of God abiding in them. <HI>I have written unto you, young Men, becau&s;e ye are &s;trong; and the Word of God abideth in you,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;And they are the young Men of this Flock, whom I propo&s;e now to addre&s;s, agreable to the&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle; young Men, who de&s;ire to bear and receive the Word of God, and of whom it may be hop'd, that his Word, both <HI>written</HI> and <HI>preached.</HI> will <HI>abide</HI> in them, to &s;trengthen them unto &s;piritual Conflicts with, and Victory over Satan's Temptations, and thereby furni&s;h them for good Service to God, and their Genera|tion. And happy tho&s;e young Men, who are not only young in <HI>Age,</HI> but young Men in <HI>Grace,</HI> and in Chri&s;tian Knowledge and Practice, <HI>&s;trong</HI> Men in Chri&s;t; in whom this Character, and Commendation may be verified, <HI>Ye are &s;trong to overcome the wicked one,</HI> having the <HI>Word of God abiding in you.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall briefly open the Words, and then apply them for In&s;truction and Exhortation to our young Men, under &s;ome Heads of Doctrine. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. We may take Notice of the Perfection a&s;crib'd to the&s;e Young Men, which is, that they <HI>are &s;trong.</HI> As old Men are fain'd for Wi&s;dom; <HI>With the Antient is Wi&s;dom</HI> (<HI>Job</HI> 12.12.) So young Men, for Strength. <HI>The Glory of young Men is their Strength.</HI> (Prov. 20.29.) Old Men are therefore fitte&s;t for Coun&s;el and Advice, (hence it is noted as an In&s;tance of great Weakne&s;s and Indi&s;cretion in <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> that <HI>he for&s;ook the Coun&s;el of the old Men</HI> 1 King. 12.13.) as young Men are for Execution by their bodily Strength, which is mo&s;t eminent in tho&s;e of that Age. But it is &s;piritual Strength which is here intended, and the Effects of it are &s;piritual, in the Conque&s;t of the Wicked one. And tho&s;e who are young in Grace, are to be commended for this Strength, whereby they are ena|bled to overcome their Lu&s;ts, and to re&s;i&s;t Temptations.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="008104_0006_102E2BA0AE1E51F8">
2. The Means of this Strength is the <HI>Word of God abiding in them.</HI> Strength of the Mind, which is here &s;poken of, lies in &s;trong Rea&s;ons, which beget Re&s;olution, whereby the Mind is fortified again&s;t all Solicitations to turn a&s;ide from the Way of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And the Word of God affords the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;ons, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Heart again&s;t Satan's Temptations; taken from the Evil of Sin, the Excellency, Plea&s;ure and Ad|vantage of the Ways of Holine&s;s, the Death of Chri&s;t for the Expiation of Sin, the Love and Mercy of God towards repenting Sinners, the awful Judgment to come, the Horrors of Hell, and the Happine&s;s of Heaven, all clearly revealed in the Word of God. And tho&s;e who have this Word abiding in them, as a Principle of the &s;piritual Life, deeply rooted in their Hearts, are thereby well furni&s;hed with Strength again&s;t their &s;piritual Enemies. The Word of God is the great Weapon of our &s;piritual Warfare. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.17.&mdash;<HI>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The main Evidence, or Effect of this &s;piritual Strength, thro' the Word of God abiding in them, is their Victory over Satan, who is <HI>the Wicked One,</HI> and all his Lu&s;ts and Temptations;&mdash;<HI>and have overcome the Wicked One.</HI> He cannot mean a full and final Conque&s;t; for <HI>that</HI> is not to be expected till the End of Life. <HI>Then</HI> (and not before) our Warfare &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, and we pa&s;s from this militant State to the triumphant; but the Victory was begun at their fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, when they fir&s;t embraced the Holy Religion of Chri&s;t, being enabled by divine Grace to renounce the Devil, and all his Works, and to overcome all the Oppo&s;ition he could make again&s;t their Entrance into the Kingdom of God. And this was a real Victory over that Wicked one, and an Earne&s;t and Pledge of a full and compleat Victory at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. This De&s;cription and Commendation he gives of the&s;e young Men in Chri&s;t, that he might the better en|force the Exhortations to Holine&s;s, which he writes to them in this Epi&s;tle. <HI>I have written to you, young Men,
<PB N="5" REF="008104_0007_102E2BA42CCF63C8">for ye are &s;trong,</HI> &amp;c. And in pre&s;&s;ing any Branch of Duty, certainly one of the mo&s;t effectual Methods to gain our Point, e&s;pecially with young People, is, to take Notice of and commend the Beginnings and Appearances of it in them, or &s;uch In&s;tances of virtuous Goodne&s;s, as they have already attain'd unto: this, be&s;ide the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Duty exhorted to, will excite a laudable Am|bition to go on, and make good the Commendation given them, in a more eminent Degree.&mdash;But I &s;hall endeavour further to explain the&s;e &s;everal Heads of the <HI>Text,</HI> in a few Ob&s;ervations from it.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. That it is the Duty, and will be the Commendation, Honour, and Happine&s;s of young Men, to be &s;trong to overcome the Wicked one.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. The Means of acquiring this Strength is the Word of God, our receiving it into our Hearts, and having it abiding in us.</P>
<P>DOCT. III. That young Men, even &s;uch as have experienced the effectual &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ion of the Word, are to be exhorted, and encouraged to the Duties of Chri&s;tian Piety, by the Word of God, written or preached. I can &s;peak but briefly to each of the&s;e Points.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. That it is the Duty, and will be the Com|mendation, Honour, and Happine&s;s of young Men, to be &s;trong to overcome the Wicked one. Here I &s;hall make a few Remarks in general, for Illu&s;tration.</P>
<P N="1">1. By <HI>the wicked one</HI> is meant the Devil. This is the Character he bears in the Writings of this Apo&s;tle. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Not as Gain who was of that wicked one,</HI> (i. e. the Devil, who was a <HI>Murderer from the beginning</HI>) and &s;lew his righteous Brother. He had &s;aid before, ver. 8. <HI>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</HI> This he exempli|fies in <HI>Cain,</HI> who was of that <HI>wicked one,</HI> the fir&s;t-born of <HI>Satan.</HI> So <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.18. <HI>He that is begotten of God, keep|eth him&s;elf; and that wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> And he is el&s;ewhere in Scripture &s;tiled <HI>the wicked one.</HI> As in our Saviour's Parable of the Tares, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.38. <HI>The Tares are the Children of the wicked one,</HI> i. e. the Chil|dren
<PB N="6" REF="008104_0008_102E2BA5C4A78F10">of the Devil; &s;o 'tis explain'd in the next Words, <HI>ver.</HI> 38. <HI>The Enemy that &s;owed them, is the Devil.</HI> And in the old Te&s;tament we meet with the &s;ame Appellation. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 109.6. <HI>Set thou a wicked Man over him; and let Satan &s;tand at his right Hand.&mdash;Ayn&s;worth</HI> tran&s;lates it, <HI>Set in Office the wicked one over him.</HI> The P&s;alm is a prophetick Imprecation again&s;t <HI>Judas,</HI> the Betrayer of our Lord; as appears from the Application of the follow|ing 8th <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> to <HI>Judas,</HI> in <HI>Act.</HI> 1.20. And we know, the Devil had full Power given him over <HI>Judas,</HI> to hurry him on to his unnatural Trea&s;on again&s;t his Ma&s;ter; and after that, to lay violent Hands on him&s;elf. There are many wicked ones among the Children of Men, but the Devil is eminently and emphatically called <HI>that wicked one;</HI> being him&s;elf, the fir&s;t in Wickedne&s;s, and fix'd in Wick|edne&s;s and Malice again&s;t God, and Holine&s;s. <HI>The Devil &s;inneth from the Beginning.</HI> (1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.8.) He was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Rebel, and Ringleader in Sin and Rebellion again&s;t God. 'Twas he that &s;educed our fir&s;t Parents to that great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which has involv'd all Mankind in Sin and Death. And he has made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s ever &s;ince to draw and entice others to Sin and Wickedne&s;s; and is the Father of all Sinners among Men. <HI>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</HI> (ibid.) <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil</HI> (&s;aid Chri&s;t to the unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI>) <HI>and the Lu&s;ts of your Father ye will do.</HI> (Joh. 8.44.) He is the <HI>Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and that malici|ous apo&s;tate <HI>Spirit, that works</HI> in all <HI>the Children of Di&s;o|bedience.</HI> (<HI>Eph.</HI> 2.2.) He works in the Hearts of all wick|ed People by their Lu&s;ts and corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;tigating them to evil Practices. Ju&s;tly therefore may he be &s;tiled the wicked One.</P>
<P>But note here. Tho' he be called the <HI>wicked One,</HI> in the &s;ingular Number, yet we are not to think, that there is but one &s;ingle wicked Spirit, that goes by the Name of the <HI>Devil</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> in Scripture; if &s;o, &s;urely, he could not carry on his wicked De&s;igns with Men, all over the World, without having a Sort of Omnipre&s;ence
<PB N="7" REF="008104_0009_102E2BA96E528928">a&s;cribed to him. But the Scripture repre&s;ents their Num|ber to be very great. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> terms them wicked Spirits, in the plural. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.12. <HI>We wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood, but again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es</HI> (<HI>Marg.</HI> Wicked Spirits) <HI>in high Places.</HI> There is an innumerable Company of the&s;e apo&s;tate Angels, many Legions of them. We read, not only of &s;even Devils, that were ca&s;t out of one Woman (<HI>Luk.</HI> 8.2.) but of a <HI>Legion</HI> of Devils, which Chri&s;t ca&s;t out of one Man. (<HI>Mar.</HI> 5.9.) "Notwith&s;tanding the great Employment the Devils have among Men, walking to and fro in the Earth, to pre&s;erve and enlarge their Empire among the Children of Di&s;obedience, we &s;ee they could &s;pare an whole Legion to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one Man." How va&s;t then mu&s;t their Number be? And when we read of the Devil or Satan, in the &s;ingular Number, it is &s;uppos'd, that the grand Devil is intended, who is called <HI>the Prince of Devils. Matt.</HI> 12.24. For he is repre&s;ented as having a Kingdom in Oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 26, 28. And there is a va&s;t Number of the&s;e apo&s;tate Spirits in Confederacy with the Arch-Devil, in the Rebellion again&s;t God; who are called the <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>the Devil. Rev.</HI> 12.9. <HI>The Dragon was ca&s;t out&mdash;and his Angels with him. Matt.</HI> 25.41.&mdash;<HI>Everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> And it is &s;uppos'd to have been one of tho&s;e Angels of Satan, with whom <HI>Paul</HI> had that Conflict, mentioned 2 Cor. 12.7.&mdash;<HI>There was given me a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, a Me&s;&s;enger of Satan to buffet one.</HI> And &s;ince they have all one common Intere&s;t, being combined together again&s;t God, and Chri&s;t, and Holine&s;s, and the Salvation of Men's Souls; therefore whenever any one Angel of Satan a&s;&s;aults any particular Per&s;on with his Temptations, the Devil is &s;aid to tempt him. And whenever &s;uch an Angel of Satan is re&s;i&s;ted or overcome, the Devil or the wicked One is &s;aid to be overcome, as if he were but one &s;ingle evil Spirit; becau&s;e they all hold together in one common Intere&s;t, being united in Oppo&s;ition to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="008104_0010_102E2BAB01F3E890">
2. The Things implied in overcoming this wicked One are,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this wicked One is an Enemy, the great Enemy of our Souls. All Victory &s;uppo&s;es Oppo&s;ition from an Enemy we have gotten the Ma&s;tery of: and the three great Enemies we are called to encounter in this our warfaring State, are the Fle&s;h, the World, and the Devil. But of the&s;e, the Devil is the principal; the World and the Fle&s;h are his Auxiliaries; the World &s;up|plies the Matter of his Temptations. either the Plea&s;ures and Gratifications of Sen&s;e, or the Terrors of Sen&s;e; the Fle&s;h or carnal Lu&s;ts are the traiterous Party in our own Bo&s;om, which are ready to betray us into the Snares of Satan; and by the&s;e Means he &s;eeks to circumvent, and ruin us. Wherefore Satan is to be con&s;ider'd as our Enemy in a three-fold Re&s;pect, either as a Tempter, an Accu&s;er, or a Tormentor.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) As a Tempter. Herein he plainly &s;hews his Enmity, that by tempting Men to &s;in again&s;t God and tran&s;gre&s;s his Laws, he might de&s;troy them in Soul and Body forever. This was his Aim in tempting our fir&s;t Parents to a Revolt from God: and what Ruin has he thereby bro't on Mankind? And this mali|cious De&s;ign he pur&s;ues in all his Temptations ever &s;ince, whereby he has been &s;educing the Children of <HI>Adam.</HI> In this his tempting Work (how plau&s;ible &s;oever he appears in his Temptations to deluded Sinners) <HI>he goes about as a roaring Lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8.) Hence he has his Name, <HI>the Tempter.</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. 3.5.&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) As an Accu&s;er. Having tempted Men to &s;in, he accu&s;eth them to God, that he may obtain a fuller Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and greater Power over them. So that Imprecation again&s;t <HI>Judas</HI> may be under&s;tood, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 109. 6. <HI>Set a wicked Man</HI> (the wicked One, or the Devil) <HI>over him,</HI> i. e. Let him be given up to his Power, to hurry him to the Sin of betraying his Ma&s;ter; and then, <HI>Let Satan &s;tand at his right Hand,</HI> as an Accu&s;er, to his Con|demnation. The Right Hand being the Place in the antient Judicatories where the Accu&s;er &s;tood. Thus this
<PB N="9" REF="008104_0011_102E2BAC938B8270">inveterate Adver&s;ary manife&s;ts his Enmity, not only again&s;t wicked Men, who are wholly under his Power, but even again&s;t pious and good Men; as he is repre&s;ented in <HI>Zechari|ah</HI>'s, <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> as accu&s;ing <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> the High Prie&s;t of the <HI>Jews.</HI> Zech. 3.1. <HI>He &s;hewed me Jo&s;hua the High Prie&s;t &s;tanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan &s;tanding at his Right Hand to re&s;i&s;t him.</HI> So he accu&s;ed <HI>Job</HI> of Hypo|cri&s;y in &s;erving God with a mercenary Spirit. <HI>Job</HI> 1.9, 10, 11. <HI>Satan an&s;wered the Lord, and &s;aid, Doth</HI> Job <HI>fear God for nought?</HI> &amp;c. Hence he is &s;tiled the <HI>Accu&s;er of the Brethren.</HI> Rev. 12.10. But they are, for the mo&s;t Part, fal&s;e Accu&s;ations that he prefers again&s;t the People of God: but if they are not altogether groundle&s;s, they have an Advocate in Heaven, who effectually pleads for them.&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) As a Tormentor. Hence he is &s;aid to have the Power of Death. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.14.&mdash;<HI>that thro' Death he might de|&s;troy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</HI> He is permitted in the righteous Judgment of God, to have the Power of Death, or of excuting the Cur&s;e on tho&s;e who have given up them&s;elves to the Power of his Temptati|ons. So he that was their Tempter, having &s;ucceeded therein, is appointed to be their Tormentor.</ITEM>
</LIST> &mdash;In all the&s;e Re&s;pects the Devil is the grand Enemy of Mankind; but chiefly as a Tempter: For as an Accu&s;er and Tormentor he could have no Advantage again&s;t them, unle&s;s he had fir&s;t play'd his Part &s;ucce&s;sfully as a Tempter; and as &s;uch, we are therefore principally concern'd to with&s;tand this Enemy. This invi&s;ible Solicitor to Evil is little tho't on by carele&s;s Sinners, while they are intent on the Pur|&s;uit of their Lu&s;ts and carnal Imaginations; they are not &s;en&s;ible of the Agency of any invi&s;ible Spirit, that is bu&s;ily at work with, or upon them; are &s;en&s;ible of no other Influence they are under, than the Sway of their own natural Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions. But if we believe divine Revelation, we are a&s;&s;ur'd thence, that there are <HI>&s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es</HI> (or <HI>wicked Spirits</HI>) <HI>in High Places,</HI> which are the <HI>Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World,</HI> and <HI>work</HI> powerfully in all the Children of Di&s;obedience. There
<PB N="10" REF="008104_0012_102E2BB3B1096BC8">are va&s;t Multitudes of the&s;e infernal Spirits, bu&s;y with Men all over the World, endeavouring to draw, or drive them to Vice and Wickedne&s;s, or to divert them from their Duty. And tho' Satan has no immediate Knowledge of the Hearts of Men, nor immediate Acce&s;s to them, yet he may be able to reach and affect the Powers of their Souls by Means of the corporeal Organs, that Imagination and bodily Spirits and Humours which fall under his Cog|ni&s;ance; and being a mo&s;t &s;ubtle Spirit, is able to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into their Fancies, which have a great Influence on their Wills and Affections, and thereby excite and in|flame their Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions; and by Means of the cor|rupt Imaginations and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, he has a great Advantage for enforcing his Baits of Temptation. But whether we are able to account for the Manner of the Devil's tempting Men or no, the Thing it&s;elf is real and undoubted, that he has a &s;trong Hand in carrying Men out to all the wicked Acts of their Lives. Some more heinous Sins are more immediately from the In&s;piration of Satan, &s;uch as the Sin of <HI>Judas</HI> (<HI>Joh.</HI> 13.2.) &s;uch al&s;o as Bla&s;phemy, unnatural Sins, Self-murder, and the like: but in more ordinary. Sins there is more of the Hand of Satan than Men are commonly aware of, and more than even good Men are aware of: When <HI>David</HI> was &s;tir|red up to the Sin of numbring the People (for a Sin it was in God's Account, and by <HI>David</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.7, 8.) we can hardly per&s;uade our&s;elves, that he was at all &s;en&s;ible of the Agency of Satan in that Affair, or that the Rea&s;ons that mov'd him to it, were fetch'd from Hell; but it is affirm'd in the Word of God, 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.1. <HI>And Satan &s;tood up again&s;t I&s;rael, and provoked David to number I&s;rael.</HI> He has a greater Advantage again&s;t us, becau&s;e we are &s;o unob&s;ervant of him. This wicked one watches all Occa&s;ions for carrying on his wicked De&s;igns; he is a vigilant Adver&s;ary, therefore we are required to <HI>be vigilant</HI> in oppo&s;ing him, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8. Hence are tho&s;e frequent Cautions again&s;t the Wiles and Temptations of this &s;ubtle Adver&s;ary, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.3&mdash;<HI>Le&s;t Satan tempt you
<PB N="11" REF="008104_0013_102E2BB542417FD8">for your Incontinency.</HI>&mdash;2 Cor. 2.11. <HI>Le&s;t Satan &s;hould get an Advantage of us.</HI>&mdash;1 The&s;&s;. 3.5.&mdash;<HI>Le&s;t by &s;ome Means the Tempter have tempted you, and our Labour be in vain.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.7.&mdash;<HI>Le&s;t he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil.</HI>&mdash;Eph. 4.26.27. <HI>Let not the Sun go down on your Wrath: neither give Place to the Devil.</HI> Which implies, that the Devil has an Influence in rai&s;ing and fo|menting wrathful Pa&s;&s;ions, and by harbouring and indulg|ing them we give Place to him, and give great Advantage to his Temptations. All which Cautions &s;peak our Dan|ger from this Adver&s;ary as a Tempter; and as &s;uch we are particularly concern'd to with&s;tand him.</P>
<P>And let me add,</P>
<P N="2">2. The wicked one, as a Tempter, doth in a peculiar Manner a&s;&s;ault young Men with his Temptations; both young Men in Age, and young Men in Grace. As God calls mo&s;t earne&s;tly for the youthful Age to be dedicated to, and employed in his Service, <HI>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</HI>&mdash;Mic. 7.1. <HI>My Soul de&s;ired the fir&s;t ripe Fruit.</HI> So the Devil peculiarly be&s;tirs him&s;elf by his Temptations to gain over young Men to his Party and Intere&s;t, as hoping for more Service from them, than from any other Age. But if they be al&s;o young Men in Chri&s;t, they may chiefly expect his A&s;&s;aults, who have by Conver&s;ion entered on the Ways of Religion and Holine&s;s, or who begin to mind Religion in good Earne&s;t, and to &s;et their Faces <HI>Zion</HI>-wards. The&s;e Beginners in Chri&s;tianity Sa|tan bears a Spite again&s;t, and pur&s;ues them with his Temp|tations, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring them back to his Service again, or otherwi&s;e to di&s;turb their Peace and Comfort, and weary them in the Service of God. As Chri&s;t, as &s;oon as he was baptiz'd and &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated to his Office, and own'd as the Son of God, was tempted by the Devil, <HI>Matt.</HI> 4.1. And as the Chri&s;tian Church, in the Vi&s;ion of <HI>John,</HI> under the <HI>Emblem</HI> of a <HI>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</HI> &amp;c. when <HI>being with Child, cried, travailing in Birth, and pained to be delivered,</HI> i. e. &s;triving with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, Labours and Conflicts in her Mini&s;ters, under Per&s;ecutions and Suf|ferings,
<PB N="12" REF="008104_0014_102E2BB6CDAC3E80">to bring forth Children to God, <HI>The Dragon,</HI> (i. e. the Devil, that cruel and Blood-thir&s;ty Adver&s;ary) <HI>&s;tood before the Woman&mdash;to devour her Child, as &s;oon as it was born.</HI> i. e. (as it may be interpreted) to a&s;&s;ault and de|&s;troy (if po&s;&s;ible) her young Convert: &s;o young Chri&s;ti|ans mu&s;t expect Encounters from Satan, either by the Frowns or Flatteries of the World, and by the Corrupti|ons and Lu&s;ts of their own Hearts, a&s;&s;on as they &s;et out in the Ways of Godline&s;s; and &s;hould prepare accordingly, And the Ground of this Enmity of the Devil, again&s;t the new-born Chri&s;tian, we have intimated in the Cur&s;e de|nounced again&s;t the old Serpent, which involves a Promi&s;e in Favour of Mankind, Gen. 3.15. <HI>I will put Enmity be|tween thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed.</HI> Wicked Men, whil&s;t in their Apo&s;tacy from God, are in Confederacy with Satan, who is the Head of the apo&s;tate World. But by converting Grace, God puts a Principle of Enmity into the Sinner's Heart again&s;t the Devil and all his Works; and &s;o breaks off that Confede|racy: And then, no Wonder this malignant Adver&s;ary be|gins to &s;how his Enmity again&s;t God and Holine&s;s, in pur&s;uing the new Convert with his Temptations and fiery Darts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing implied in overcoming the wicked One, is a &s;triving again&s;t, or re&s;i&s;ting this Adver&s;ary. All Victory &s;uppo&s;es a preceeding Combat or Struggle with an Enemy, and our Victory over Satan is not an imaginary, but a real Thing; and therefore not to be obtain'd but by a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, and many Times by fore Conflicts. There mu&s;t be a <HI>&s;triving for the Ma&s;tery,</HI> and <HI>fighting</HI> in good earne&s;t, and <HI>not as beating the Air.</HI> (1 Cor. 9.25, 26.) But here, we are not to con&s;ider the Devil as an external Foe, or our War with him, as lying abroad, at a Di&s;tance from us; but as one that has a mighty Party within us, by who&s;e Means he carries on all his Oppo&s;ition again&s;t our Souls: And the Seat of this War is in our own Souls. For (as we have ob&s;erved) the Three grand Enemies that fight again&s;t us, are the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h;
<PB N="13" REF="008104_0015_102E2BB8595FFCA8">and as of the&s;e Three, the Devil is the principal, &s;o the mo&s;t dangerous is the Fle&s;h, or fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts of our own Hearts; tho&s;e <HI>Enemies of our own Hou&s;e,</HI> tho&s;e Traiters in our own Bo&s;oms, which are in the Intere&s;ts of the Devil, and the World; and as they do, of them&s;elves, war again&s;t our Souls, 1 Pet. 2.11. <HI>Ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul</HI>&mdash;So they often betray us unto the Devil's Snares, and the Power of the World's Temptati|ons. 'Tis by the&s;e that the Devil and World prevail a|gain&s;t us. So that the Conte&s;t, in Effect, lies between the <HI>'Spirit</HI> and the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle has repre&s;ented it. Gal. 5.17. <HI>The Fle&s;h lu&s;leth again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the Fle&s;h; and the&s;e are contrary the one to the other.</HI> Or between an enlighten'd Con&s;cience, and corrupt Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, which have different Intere&s;ts, and draw &s;everal Ways. Con&s;cience is on God's Side, and takes his Part in Behalf of the Soul. Carnal Lu&s;ts are on the Devil's Side, and take his Part again&s;t the Soul. If we yield to the corrupt Motions and Lu&s;ts of our own Hearts, we give Place to the Devil; but if we re&s;i&s;t the&s;e with Vi|gour and Re&s;olution, we re&s;i&s;t the Devil, and put him to Flight: for he can have no Advantage again&s;t us, but what we give him by our own corrupt Lu&s;ts, in yielding a Com|pliance with his Temptations. 'Tis therefore our Con|cern, to join in heartily with God and Con&s;cience, in oppo|&s;ing the carnal Inclination, and in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and mortify|ing &s;le&s;hly Lu&s;ts. This Method of &s;triving for the Ma&s;te|ry over our &s;piritual Enemies, the Apo&s;tle has recommend|ed by his own Example, 1 Cor. 9.26, 27.&mdash;<HI>So fight I, not as one that beateth the Air; but I keep under my Body</HI> (i. e. the corrupt Appetites and Lu&s;ts of the Body; and the Body it&s;elf, in Subordination to the Soul) <HI>and bring it into Sub|jection.</HI> And the Fle&s;h being thus &s;ubdued, and kept un|der due Government and in Subjection to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, and the Rules of Religion, the Devil and the World may tempt in vain. And to maintain this Re&s;i&s;tence, we are directed to <HI>put on the whole Armour of God,</HI> Eph. 6.11. The &s;everal Parts whereof are de&s;cribed, <HI>ver.</HI> 13,&mdash;18.
<PB N="14" REF="008104_0016_102E2BBC89725D90">The Meaning whereof in general is, that we &s;hould be in the daily U&s;e and Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e &s;everal Graces, and Means of &s;piritual Strength, which &s;erve as an Armour to with&s;tand our &s;piritual Enemies, and to defend our Souls again&s;t the malignant Effects of their A&s;&s;aults: As Faith, Repentance, Self-Denial, Ab&s;tinence, the Word of God, and Prayer; to which mu&s;t be joined con&s;tant Watchful|ne&s;s, as our Saviour hath directed, Matt. 26.41. <HI>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</HI></P>
<P>Hence I proceed to &s;hew.</P>
<P N="4">4. Wherein con&s;i&s;ts our Victory over the wicked One? or when, or in what In&s;tances may we be &s;aid to overcome this Enemy? We have chiefly con&s;idered him as an Ene|my to be re&s;i&s;ted and overcome, as he is a <HI>Tempter;</HI> never|thele&s;s, he is an Adver&s;ary we have al&s;o to deal with as an <HI>Accu&s;er;</HI> and there are many &s;ad Conflicts with him, as &s;uch, which both young Converts, and more improved Chri|&s;tians, are expo&s;ed to. But the be&s;t Way to get the Vic|tory over him as an Accu&s;er, is by Prevention, by repel|ling his Temptations, and maintaining our Innocence and Integrity, notwith&s;tanding all his A&s;&s;ault;; &s;o we &s;hall prevent his De&s;ign in feelding Occa&s;ion to accu&s;e us to God, or render his Accu&s;ations groundle&s;s, and then they can do us no Harm. But if we yield to his Temptations, in being thereby drawn to Sin, both the Law of God and our own Confciences will join in with Satan, in accu&s;ing and condemning us: In which Ca&s;e (as it but too often happens) the only Way to overcome this Adver&s;ary as an Accu&s;er, is to have Recour&s;e to the Blood of the Lamb. Thus the primitive Chri&s;tians <HI>overcame the Accu&s;er of the Brethren, by the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> (Rev. 12.10, 11.) In this Ca&s;e we mu&s;t fly to the Patronage of our almighty Advocate Je&s;us Chri&s;t, confe&s;&s;ing Guilt, and pleading with God the Propitiation in the Blood of Chri&s;t, and his all|&s;ufficient Merit and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to which alone we be|take our&s;elves by Faith, for Ju&s;tification; and by which all Satan's Accu&s;ations are invalidated, to the Believer. And upon this Plea we may &s;tand &s;ecure, and boldly make that
<PB N="15" REF="008104_0017_102E2BC203797338">Challenge, Rom. 8.33.34. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? it is God that ju&s;tifieth. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chri&s;t that died; yea rather, that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right Hand of God, who al&s;o maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us.</HI> So we may <HI>come off more than Conquerors, thro' him that loved us.</HI> Ver. 27.</P>
<P>But the Enquiry chiefly relates to our Victory over Sa|tan as a <HI>Tempter.</HI> And then we may be &s;aid to overcome the wicked one, when we &s;ucce&s;sfully re&s;i&s;t his Tempta|tions, and &s;tand our Ground, &s;o as to defeat his cur&s;ed De&s;ign thereby, either to draw us to Sin and Wickedne&s;s, or to divert us from our Duty. And the Devil being o|vercome, as a Tempter, our Victory over him as an Ac|cu&s;er and Tormentor, follows of Cour&s;e. And there are Three &s;pecial Sea&s;ons, in which we are called to encounter and overcome this gho&s;tly Adver&s;ary; which are &s;o many In&s;tances of our Victory over him.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) At Conver&s;ion; when a Sinner by divine Grace breaks thro' all Oppo&s;ition, from the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h, in a re&s;olute turning from Sin to God. The Devil &s;ets him&s;elf with all his Power and Craft to oppo&s;e and hinder the &s;aving Conver&s;ion of a Soul. He rai&s;es all his Forces, from the Fle&s;h and the World, in Oppo&s;ition to it. The Fle&s;h, he knows, is in his Intere&s;t, being whol|ly addicted to the Things of Time and Sen&s;e, whereby he endeavours to extingui&s;h all &s;piritual Sen&s;ations and Moti|ons of the Soul to God and Holine&s;s and the Things a|bove; for <HI>the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to his Law,</HI> Rom. 8.7. And the carnal Mind, Lu&s;ts and Imaginations, are the &s;trong Holds of Satan in Men's Spirits; which mu&s;t be ca&s;t down by a &s;uperior Pow|er, before they will be captivated to the Obedience of Chri&s;t. Hence his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hearts of Sinners, and Dominion over them, our Saviour has repre&s;ented by the Parable of <HI>a &s;trong Man armed keeping his Palace,</HI> Luk. 11.21, 22. And the worldly Baits of Plea&s;ure, Pro|fit, and Honour, &s;uited to the Three capital Lu&s;ts, the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;ts of the Eye,</HI> and <HI>the Pride of
<PB N="16" REF="008104_0018_102E2BC6018E6448">Life,</HI> are the Armour wherewith the &s;trong Man endea|vours to &s;trengthen his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Palace (i. e. of the Souls of Men) and does all he can to &s;ecure it to him&s;elf, and fortify it again&s;t the Lord Je&s;us. The Devil is &s;o mortal an Enemy to the Conver&s;ion of Souls, becau&s;e thereby his Kingdom goes to Ruin, which is founded in Sin and Wickedne&s;s. And he has often a great Hand in preventing the &s;aving Efficacy of the Word for Conver&s;ion, in many carele&s;s Souls, by di&s;tracting their Minds with worldly Cares, diverting them from a &s;erious Attention, filling them with vain Fancies and drawing out their Lu&s;ts, that he might intercept the &s;aving Profit of the Word; as our Saviour has plainly intimated, Matt. 13.19. <HI>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom, and under&s;tand|eth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was &s;own in his Heart.</HI> The Devil is e&s;peci|ally very active and bu&s;y with Souls under Convictions and Awakenings, either tempting them to Pre&s;umption, per&s;uading them that &s;ome &s;light Sorrow for Sin, and a few Words of Confe&s;&s;ion and Prayer, is enough to intitle them to God's Mercy; and that there is no Need of &s;o much Strictne&s;s and Preci&s;ene&s;s, but that they may yet &s;afely allow them&s;elves in &s;ome carnal Liberties, and after all hope in God's Mercy for Pardon and Salvation: Or el&s;e per&s;uading them that they have Time enough for Repen|tance, and that there is no need of &s;o much Ha&s;te in the Ma&s;ter; but that they may defer it till, they have ta&s;ted the Plea&s;ures of Sin, and bathed them&s;elves in the Delights of the Fle&s;h and the World a little longer, unto a <HI>more convenient Sea&s;on,</HI> which they promi&s;e them&s;elves with <HI>Felix,</HI> Act. 24, 25. and thus the Convictions of many prove abortive.&mdash;Or di&s;couraging them by repre&s;enting the Difficulties &amp; Au&s;terities of a religious Life, to re&s;train them by Fear, or by working on their Shame; &s;ugge&s;ting, that they will be laugh'd at by their loo&s;e Companions, as hy|pocritical and preci&s;e.&mdash;Or if all this will not an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e, but their Convictions are too powerful to be re|moved by &s;uch &s;lighty Methods; then he betakes him&s;elf
<PB N="17" REF="008104_0019_102DCF510EFC5978">to his terrifying A&s;&s;aults, and tempts them to de&s;pair of God's Mercy, by repre&s;enting their Sins in &s;uch horrid Aggravations, as to leave no Room for Hope; and thus he &s;ets upon them as a <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> increa&s;ing the Horrors of their Con&s;ciences, by &s;etting before them the Terrors of the Law, and concealing from them the only Relief or Remedy bro't in by Go&s;pel-Grace, urging upon their Minds the de&s;perate Conclu&s;ion, that they are Ca&s;t|aways, and abandoned by God; and that it is in vain to u&s;e the Means, to pray, or entertain any Hope of Salva|tion. Thus the Devil &s;ets him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the Conver|&s;ion of a Soul, either by his &s;tubtle Wiles, or fiery Darts. Now, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, this malicious Adver&s;ary may be &s;aid to be overcome, when an awaken'd Sinner, under deep Conviction of the Sinfulne&s;s and Danger of his State, breaks thro' all Di&s;couragements and Impediments, and with a fixed Re&s;olution gets over all Oppo&s;ition from within and from without, and with a &s;teady Violence pre&s;&s;es into the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>For the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Violence, and the violent take it by Force.</HI> (Matt. 11.12.) When be not only <HI>&s;eeks,</HI> but <HI>&s;trives to enter in at the &s;trait Gale.</HI> (Luk. 13.24.) When he puts a kind of Force upon his corrupt Nature; and notwith&s;tanding the Temptations of the World, and the Sugge&s;tions of the wicked One, he is re&s;olv'd, upon any Terms, to &s;ecure the Salvation of his Soul: When a Sinner, I &s;ay, thus re&s;o|lutely breaks thro' all this potent Oppo&s;ition, to get into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, this is a glorious Victory; he is already a Conqueror; tho' it is by the Power of divine Grace, that he gets this Victory. And to the Honour of this divine Grace it mu&s;t ultimately be refer'd. 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The Weapons of our Warfare are&mdash;mighty through God,</HI> &amp;c. Yet the Victory it&s;elf, in the Work of Repen|tance and Conver&s;ion, mu&s;t be the Sinner's own Act, under the Influence of divine Grace. 2 Tim. 2.25, 26.&mdash;<HI>If God peradventure will give them Repentance, to the acknow|ledging of the Truth; and that they may recover them&s;elves our of the Snare of the Devil, who are taken Captive by
<PB N="18" REF="008104_0020_102E2BC88DF36940">him at his Will.</HI> When God gives Repentance, the Penitent co-operates with the Grace of God, and <HI>recovers him&s;elf out of the Snare of the Devil,</HI> and &s;o overcomes; and in &s;tead of being any longer a Captive of Satan, triumphs over him.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another In&s;tance of this Victory over Satan is, when he is re&s;i&s;ted in any particular &s;trong Temptation, wherewith he a&s;&s;aults the Chri&s;tian. Tho' converting Grace &s;ets the Chri&s;tian at Liberty in a great Mea&s;ure from the Power of Satan's Temptations, yet it does not free him from the A&s;&s;aults of his Temptations. The&s;e he mu&s;t expect, more or le&s;s, during his whole Life: but a &s;tedfa&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance of this malicious Adver&s;ary is, in Effect, Victory over him. For a Chri&s;tian not to yield, not to <HI>give Place to the Devil</HI> (as the Expre&s;&s;ion is, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.27.) but to &s;tand his Ground, is to overcome: There|fore &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.7.&mdash;<HI>Re&s;i&s;t the Devil, and he will &s;lee from you;</HI> he will &s;lee as a baffled Enemy. There is no <HI>Medium</HI> in this War, between conquering and being conquered. If therefore, when the Tempter &s;eeks by carnal Plea&s;ures or carnal Fears to turn us a&s;ide from our Duty, or &s;olicit us to that which is Evil, we tamely yield to his Solicitation, we put the Victory into his Hand, and &s;uffer our&s;elves to be overcome by him. But if we &s;tand out with Re&s;olution not to yield upon any Terms, we conquer, and put to flight our Enemy.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Devilis finally overcome, when a Chri&s;tian holds out with Con&s;tancy in this Warfare, until the fini&s;hing of his Cour&s;e, and &s;uffers not him&s;elf to be &s;educed or di|verted by all the Temptations and Oppo&s;itions he meets with, in his Way to the Kingdom of God, from the Devil and the World, but approves him&s;elf a faithful Soldier and Follower of Chri&s;t unto Death: For to be faithful unto Death, and finally to overcome, are in Effect the &s;ame Thing. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e it follows, <HI>ver.</HI> 11.&mdash;<HI>He that overcometh, &s;hall not be hurt of the &s;econd Death.</HI> Then the Chri&s;tian Soldier is a com|pleat
<PB N="19" REF="008104_0021_102E2BCB5B56EE90">Conqueror, and receives the Garland of Immortality from the Captain of his Salvation. The Victory over the wicked one, in the two former Re&s;pects, the Chri&s;tian gains in this Life; and this is e&s;pecially intended in our Text; for the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of a Conque&s;t already obtained: <HI>Ye have overcome the wicked one.</HI> The final Victory is re&s;erv'd till the Time that he puts off Mortality, and therewith all the Relicts of Corruption. Then <HI>Satan,</HI> with all his confederate Powers, the Fle&s;h, and the World, &s;hall be entirely vanqui&s;h'd, according to that Promi&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.20. <HI>The God of Peace &s;hall brui&s;e Satan under your Feet &s;hortly.</HI> Then the conquering Chri&s;tian &s;hall be &s;et beyond the Reach of all A&s;&s;ailants for ever. The Tempter has <HI>no Place found</HI> for him <HI>in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I add now,</P>
<P N="5">5. There is much &s;piritual Strength required for get|ting this Victory. As no Victory is to be obtain'd without a preceeding Fight or Struggle, wherein the Strength of the Combatant is tried; &s;o this is an Adver&s;ary not to be repell'd or put to Flight by a faint Re&s;i&s;tance; but the Exertion of our utmo&s;t Strength and Vigour is requi&s;ite to that End. For this, the&s;e young Men are commended, <HI>Ye are &s;trong,&mdash;and have overcome the wicked one.</HI> Now Strength is two-fold, natural and &s;piritual. Again, natural Strength is either of the Body or of the Mind. Bodily Strength, tho' a natural Perfection, and the Glory of young Men, who are apt to boa&s;t in their Strength, where|by they are are able to wor&s;t an Adver&s;ary, yet is no great Excellence, nor properly human; many of the brutal Kind are, for Strength, &s;uperiour to the &s;tronge&s;t Men: <HI>Let not,</HI> then, <HI>the mighty Man glory in his Might.</HI> (Jer. 9.23.) There is al&s;o the Strength of the Mind and Spirit;&mdash;Of the <HI>Mind,</HI> to comprehend and retain a great Number of <HI>Idea's,</HI> and to rea&s;on with Force and Clearne&s;s, upon any Subject. And Strength of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> to bear up with Alacrity and Vigour under Afflictions and Infirmi|ties. <HI>The Spirit of a Man will &s;u&s;tain his Infirmity.</HI> (Prov. 18.14.)

<PB N="20" REF="008104_0022_102E2BCCEC748610">thy Strength is &s;mall.</HI> (Chap. 24.10.) And al&s;o to encounter Dangers with an undaunted Valour, to face an Enemy in the Field of Battle, with a firm and fearle&s;s Re&s;olution. This is martial Strength or Courage, ari&s;ing from the Heat of Blood and Spirits. And this Kind of Strength, e&s;pecially if join'd with bodily Strength, is of great U&s;e to the Publick in a Time of War, in tho&s;e that are called out for its Defence, or engag'd in any military Expedition again&s;t an Enemy: And it is much to be commended and encouraged in our young Men, who are chiefly (as In&s;truments in the Hand of Providence) our Strength and Defence in a Time of War; and who, as the pre&s;ent War continues, may be called forth into the Service of the Publick, again&s;t the Enemies of our Land; their Fortitude both of Body and Mind, Courage and Valour join'd with bodily Strength, will be likely to do Honour to them&s;elves, and their Country.&mdash;But it is not natural Strength, that is required to combate with, and overcome the wicked Spirit; yea, tho&s;e that excel in bodily Strength, are often &s;ome of the chief Slaves of the Devil, and are ea&s;ily taken Captive by him at his Will; while many of a weaker Con&s;titution are enabled by divine Grace to &s;tand their Ground, and put him to Flight. But it is <HI>&s;piritual Strength,</HI> that is &s;uited to this &s;piritual War|fare, which con&s;i&s;ts in a firm Re&s;olution, grounded on the eternal Rea&s;ons of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, propounded to us in the Word of God. 'Tis the Strength of the inner Man. Hence that Prayer of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.16. <HI>That he would grant unto you according to the Riches of his Glory, to be &s;trengthened with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man.</HI> 'Tis the Strength of Faith, Hope, Love, Joy, Zeal, Patience; which divine Graces are begotten, che|ri&s;h'd and invigorated in us by the Word, accompanied by the Spirit of God to our Hearts, and are our Armour of Defence again&s;t all the Enemies of our Salvation. The Chri&s;tian Graces, therefore, are often &s;et forth in Scrip|ture, under the Notion of Armour, adapted to their &s;piri|tual Warfare; particularly 1 The&s;&s;. 5.8.&mdash; <HI>Puting on
<PB N="21" REF="008104_0023_102E2BCE821C11D0">the Brea&s;t-plate of Faith and Love, and for an Helmet the Hope of Salvation.</HI> The&s;e Graces in their vital Exerci&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h the Soul, as on a firm Rock, again&s;t all the A&s;&s;aults the Devil can make upon it, either by the Allure|ments or Terrors of Sen&s;e. This Strength we derive from Chri&s;t, by his Spirit, in whom we have both <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 45.24.) and are therefore directed to depend on him alone for Strength in all our &s;piritual Conflicts; to <HI>be &s;trong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might</HI> (<HI>Eph.</HI> 6.10.) to <HI>be &s;trong in the Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1.) This Strength is not of our&s;elves; if left to our&s;elves, or to the meer Power of Nature, we &s;hould every Day be liable to be|come an ea&s;y Prey to Satan; but it is put into us by &s;u|pernatural divine Grace. Hence, when <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>buffetted</HI> by a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of Satan,</HI> be receiv'd this An&s;wer from the Lord to his Prayer for Help and Deliverance; <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee: for my Strength is made per|fect in Weakne&s;s.</HI> (2 Cor. 12.9.) <HI>Therefore</HI> (&s;aith he, <HI>Ver.</HI> 10.) <HI>I take Plea&s;ure in Infirmities,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for when I am weak, then am I &s;trong.</HI> And the Strength of divine Grace in a weak Believer will enable him to carry the Victory over this mighty Adver&s;ury.</P>
<P>And now, what a commendable Thing? What a glori|ous Thing is it, in any Chri&s;tian, compa&s;&s;ed with Infirmities, to be able in the Strength of divine Grace to combat with, and conquer this inveterate Enemy of his Soul, the wicked one? What Glory and Renown do earthly Conquerors think them&s;elves intitled to, who fight but <HI>again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood?</HI> And what Honours and Applau&s;es are paid them by High and Low, on their gaining any &s;ignal Victo|ry? Surely, it is a much more reputable and glorious Thing in the Eye of Heaven, to become a Conqueror in the &s;piritual War, in fighting <HI>again&s;t &s;piritual Wicked|ne&s;&s;es in High Places;</HI> as the Perfections and Attainments of the Mind are far more noble and excellent than tho&s;e of the Body. And it is a great Favour of God. and a great Honour that he puts upon a poor &s;inful Man, when
<PB N="22" REF="008104_0024_102E2BD190431DD0">he is enabled by Strength from above to recover him&s;elf out of the Snare, and from under the Power of the Devil, and to grapple with and overcome this gho&s;tly Adver&s;ary. This will intitle him to the Approbation of God, to the <HI>Euge</HI> and Applau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and of holy Angels, which is an Honour, to which there is nothing comparable on Earth.</P>
<P>And if this &s;piritual Strength, and Victory obtain|ed by it, be ju&s;tly reckon'd a commendable Attainment in any others of the Sons of Men, it is much more &s;o in tho&s;e of the youthful Age, in whom the bodily Appe|tites and Pa&s;&s;ions are u&s;ually mo&s;t impetuous, and impor|tunate to be gratified, which gives Satan a great Advantage again&s;t them. But it will be an Argument of &s;piritual Fortitude in young Men, highly to their Commendation, to be able to govern their Affections. Appetites, Sen&s;es and Pa&s;&s;ions, and keep them in Subjection to the Rule of Rea&s;on and Grace, &s;o as to defeat the Temptations of the wicked one. Young Men are apt to value them&s;elves upon their bodily Strength, when they have thereby been an Over-match for an Antagoni&s;t; yet this which &s;eems &s;o glorious, hath no Glory in Compari&s;on of the more ex|cellent Strength, which enables them to &s;truggle with and get the Ma&s;tery of &s;piritual Enemies. For, &s;aith <HI>Solomon, He that ruleth his Spirit, is</HI> better <HI>than he that taketh a City.</HI> (Prov. 16.32.) There needs great Strength of Re&s;oluti|on, and a wi&s;e Conduct, for a Man to conquer him&s;elf and &s;ubdue his Will and Pa&s;&s;ions to the grave Dictates of Rea|&s;on and Con&s;cience. And this is a more honourable and happy Conque&s;t, than that which is obtained over an Ene|my by outward Force, Blood and Slaughter, which is a Stain to Victory it&s;elf. And while we keep up the Go|vernment and Command of our&s;elves, and keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our own Souls, we fru&s;trate the Attempts of the wick|ed one, and triumph over him; who can have no Power again&s;t us as a Tempter, but in and from our&s;elves. 1 Joh. 5.18.&mdash;<HI>He keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> Let young Men then &s;ee here the Way to true Glory. <HI>Shew your&s;elves Men,</HI> by pre&s;erving the Dignity
<PB N="23" REF="008104_0025_102E2BD327AAF7E0">of your rational Nature, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing corrupt Affections and Lu&s;ts, keeping a watchful Eye, and a &s;trict Hand over that traiterous Party within your&s;elves, whence your great|e&s;t Danger ari&s;es in this Warfare; in which your main Contention ought to be for the Dominion of Rea&s;on and Grace over carnal Pa&s;&s;ions and Imaginations, by &s;trictly adhering to the Principles and Precepts of Wi&s;dom and Virtue. And if you prevail in this Conte&s;t (which is in it&s;elf ju&s;tifiable and honourable in the Sight of God, and of all wi&s;e and good Men) it will redound to your ever|la&s;ting Honour. What an honourable Memorial is left of &s;acred Record, of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> when a young Man in <HI>Poti|phar</HI>'s Family, in his giving that brave Repul&s;e to the Temptations he was acco&s;ted with from his lewd Mi&s;tre&s;s? <HI>How can I do this great Wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> (Gen. 39.9.) This was a noble Victory, and 'tis recorded to his Prai&s;e thro' all Generations. Tho' your grand Enemy be very powerful and politic, yet by the Grace of Chri&s;t you may overcome; and if you &s;tedfa&s;tly adhere to his Intere&s;t, in his Strength you &s;hall overcome; and the weaker in your&s;elves, the more glorious will be the Victory obtain'd in the Strength of divine Grace. 'Tis recorded to the Honour of <HI>David,</HI> that, tho' a Strippling. yet in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts he encounter'd and vanqui&s;h'd the <HI>Phili&s;tine</HI> Giant, <HI>Goliah</HI> of <HI>Gath,</HI> and &s;ilenc'd his in&s;olent Boa&s;ts and Threats. On which Oc|ca&s;ion, 'tis tho't, he penn'd the 8th <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> in which he thus &s;ings, (<HI>Ver.</HI> 2.) <HI>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Suck|lings ha&s;t thou ordained Strength, becau&s;e of thine Enemies; that thou mighte&s;t &s;till the Enemy and the Avenger.</HI> And in the Name and Strength of Chri&s;t (tho' in your&s;elves as weak as <HI>Babes</HI> and <HI>Sucklings</HI>) you may be as &s;ucce&s;sful in conquering the <HI>Goliah</HI> of Hell, to the Prai&s;e of divine Strength, which is made perfect in Weakne&s;s; at the &s;ame Time, it will be a great Honour and Happine&s;s God will be&s;tow upon you, in making you victorious over this infer|nal Adver&s;ary. By overcoming this wicked one, you will &s;hew forth a &s;uperior Strength thro' the Grace of the
<PB N="24" REF="008104_0026_102E2BD59F547260">&s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> to that which the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> with all his Perfections in Paradi&s;e was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of or at lea&s;t put in Exerci&s;e, when tempted to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Hereby you will in &s;ame Mea&s;ure retrieve the Honour of the human Nature, that was &s;o &s;hamefully forfeited and thrown away by our fir&s;t Parents yielding to the Temptations of the Devil; hereby you will gain Re-admittance to the Tree of Life, or a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality, tho' not in the earthly, yet (which will be infinitely more to your Advantage) in the heavenly Paradi&s;e; according to that Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, Rev. 2.7. <HI>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the mid&s;t of the Pa|radi&s;e of God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the fir&s;t Point of Ob&s;ervation, which I propo&s;ed chiefly to in&s;i&s;t on, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>as it is the Duty of all, &s;o it will be peculiarly the Commendation, Honour and Happine&s;s of young Men, to overcome the wicked one.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now add a Word or two to the remaining Heads of Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>The Means of acquiring this Strength is the Word of God; our receiving it into our Hearts, and having it abiding in us.&mdash;Ye are &s;trong, and the Word of God abideth in you,</HI> &amp;c. Or, becau&s;e the Word of God abideth in you, ye are made &s;trong to re&s;i&s;t and over|come Satan and his Temptations. This &s;piritual Strength we have from Chri&s;t originally, as the principal Author, communicated to us by his Spirit; but the Word of God (<HI>viz.</HI> in the Go&s;pel-Revelation) is the Means of its Communication. And this Word is a very apt and proper Means of imparting Strength to the Souls of Men, whether for Duties and Services, or for Sufferings and Trials, or for Conflicts with &s;piritual Enemies; for all which Purpo&s;es, we need to be <HI>&s;trengthened with Might by the Spirit in the inner Man.</HI> But it is Strength for our &s;piritual Warfare, as the Effect of the indwelling Word, that comes under pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration. And the Word of God received and improved by Faith, is the Soul's Strength, whereby it is able to with&s;tand the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="008104_0027_102E2BD83A77AE90">A&s;&s;aults of Temptation. It is the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> which being wielded by the Hand of Faith, never fails to put to Flight our great Adver&s;ary. It was by the &s;ame Means, that Chri&s;t vanqui&s;hed the Devil, when tempted by him in the Wilderne&s;s; by alledging pertinent Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture (which the Devil could not with&s;tand the Force of) <HI>It is written,</HI> &amp;c. Matth. 4.1, 4, &amp;c. And by the Example of our Lord we are taught and encourag'd to make u&s;e of the &s;ame Weapon, for repelling the A&s;&s;aults of this Adver&s;ary. But it is the Word of God <HI>abiding in us,</HI> which is of &s;uch Force in our &s;piritual Conflict. This Word receiv'd and &s;ettled as a Principle in the Heart, and con&s;tantly improved by Faith and Meditation, will be to the young Man a &s;overeign Antidote again&s;t Satan's Temp|tations. So, we find it recommended by the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> to the young Man, as the Means of keeping him&s;elf pure from the defiling Lu&s;ts and Temptations of the World and the Devil. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.9. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall a young Man clean&s;e his Way? By taking Heed thereto according to thy Word.</HI> When the Word not only floats in the Imagination, or furni&s;hes Matter of Di&s;cour&s;e; but &s;inks down into the Heart, and is laid up, or hid there, as a choice Trea&s;ure, It will be an effectual Guard again&s;t Sin and Temptation: as the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> goes on to &s;ay, <HI>Ver.</HI> 11. <HI>Thy Word have I hid in mine Heart, that I might not &s;in again&s;t thee.</HI> If the Word hath Place and abides in our Hearts, prevailing Lu&s;ts &s;hall have no Place there; tho' they remain and infe&s;t us, they &s;hall be &s;o check'd, and kept under the Power of the Word, that they &s;hall not prevail; and &s;o Satan's De&s;igns &s;hall be more ea&s;ily de&s;eated: for he a&s;&s;aults us by the&s;e Lu&s;ts, and hath all his Succe&s;s from them. Now the Word receiv'd into, and abiding in the Heart, is available to the Purpo&s;es of our &s;piritual Warfare.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As it is the Means of quickening us to the Life of God and Holine&s;s, and thereby puts &s;piritual Strength into us. 'Tis the abiding Word, that is the Principle of the new Life. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God
<PB N="26" REF="008104_0028_102E2BDB1FA02548">which liveth and abideth for ever.</HI> And there is an irre|concileable Oppo&s;ition between this abiding Seed of Grace, and all Sin. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him.</HI> The Word of God abiding in us, as the Seed or Principle of an holy Life, has a &s;overeign Efficacy to guard it again&s;t every Thing prejudicial to this Life.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) As it maintains this &s;piritual Life in Vigour. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2. <HI>As new-born Babes, de&s;ire the &s;incere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby,</HI> i. e. increa&s;e in &s;piritual Strength, unto a confirmed State of Grace. The Word of God abiding in us, with Re&s;pect to our &s;piritual War|fare, is the &s;ame Thing in Effect with Faith in the Go&s;pel-Revelation. For it is by Faith we receive the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Word, and it's abiding Influence on the Heart. And it is Faith that is our main Armour, <HI>our Shield</HI> and <HI>Brea&s;t-plate</HI> in this &s;piritual War. (Eph. 6.16. &amp; 1 The&s;&s;. 5.8.) Yea, it is our <HI>Victory over the World,</HI> the Fle&s;h and the Devil. (1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.4.) And the holy Di&s;po&s;itions, which corre&s;pond to the Impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal Parts of the Word received by Faith, do &s;trongly fence the Soul again&s;t all Temptations. So I might go on to &s;hew how the &s;everal Parts of the Word, Doctrines, Precepts, Promi&s;es and Threatnings, contribute to our &s;piritual Strength.&mdash; The <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Word exhibit the mo&s;t potent Rea|&s;ons and Arguments to fortify Re&s;olution for our Conflicts (in which it was ob&s;erved, the Strength of the Mind con|&s;i&s;ts) as they di&s;cover to us the Evil of Sin, and the Mi&s;e|ry it has involv'd us in, and the Method of our Recovery thro' the Grace and Mercy of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the Faith whereof works by Love, which is of &s;ignal U&s;e in our &s;piritual Warfare, as well as Work and Service; and &s;erves for a Brea&s;t-plate to keep the Heart entire for God. 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 5.8. <HI>Putting on the Brea&s;t-plate of Faith and Love.</HI> The Doctrine of another Life, of a Judgment to come, a State of everla&s;ting Rewards and Puni&s;hments, are fortifying Con&s;iderations.&mdash;Faith gives Weight and Force to the <HI>Commands</HI> of the Word, by urging the Au|thority
<PB N="27" REF="008104_0029_102E2BE37756B7B0">of God upon the Con&s;cience, which &s;trikes Temp|tations dead.&mdash;Faith in the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> works by Hope, of the Favour of God, Pardon and Life everla&s;ting, which Hope is the Chri&s;tian's Helmet, (1 The&s;&s;. 5.8.&mdash;<HI>And for an Helmet, the Hope of Salvation</HI>) which &s;ecures the Head, and keeps up firm Re&s;olution under Dangers and Di&s;|couragements, and oppo&s;es the Love and Approbation of God and the eternal Reward, to all the tempting Offers of the Devil and the World&mdash;In the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Word, Faith works by Fear of Death and Judgment, the Wrath to come and eternal Damnation; which is a mighty Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the alluring Baits of Satan, and the Affrightments of Sen&s;e, whereby he &s;eeks to divert the Chri&s;tian from his heavenly Cour&s;e. There are many &s;piritual Con&s;iderations &s;ugge&s;ted in the Word of God, which tend greatly to confirm the Mind, and are effectual. being applied by Faith, to repel Satan's A&s;&s;aults, and baffle all his Attempts. Men are fir&s;t drawn off from the Con|&s;ideration of the grave and &s;erious Truths of the Word, which &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h their Hearts, before a Temptation can have any Force upon them; for its Prevalency begins here. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Lu&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. But when the Word abideth in us, and our Hearts are &s;tored with the holy Truths of it, we have a &s;piritual Weapon ready at Hand, to defend our|&s;elves, and repel the Force of all Temptations. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 30.21. <HI>Thine Ears &s;hall hear a Word behind thee, &s;aying, This is the Way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the Right Hand, and when ye turn to the Left.</HI> But not to in&s;i&s;t further on this Head.&mdash;Let me &s;peak a Word now to the third and la&s;t Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>DOCT. 3. That <HI>young Men, even &s;uch as have expe|rienced the effectual &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ion of the Word, are to be exhorted and encouraged to the Duties of Chri&s;tian Piety by the Word of God, written or preached.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e young Men, addre&s;s'd in the Text, had the Word of God abiding in them, and had Experience of the powerful Effects of it, tho' they had already overcome
<PB N="28" REF="008104_0030_102E2BE507703C60">the wicked one; yet the Apo&s;tle &s;ees meet to write to them, to in&s;truct, exhort, and admoni&s;h them.&mdash;Partly, be|cau&s;e the mo&s;t improved and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Chri&s;tians are yet but imperfect, with Regard both to their Work and Warface, and not pa&s;t all Danger, therefore have Need of frequent Excitations and Cautions from the Word of God. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.11.&mdash;<HI>By them is thy Servant warned.</HI> Much more young Men, who are but Novices in this &s;piritual War. The Apo&s;tle &s;ugge&s;ts, that tho' they had exerted their For|titude in overcoming the Wicked one, in Part, yet they had but enter'd on their Warfare, and mu&s;t not think they are out of Danger, but mu&s;t expect and prepare for new A&s;|&s;aults, and nor &s;uffer the Devil to wre&s;t the Victory they had obtain'd, out of their Hands; but pur&s;ue it to a final and compleat Conque&s;t. So his commending them for their &s;piritual Strength, is in Effect exhorting them to the Exerci&s;e of it in maintaining their Ground, with Per&s;e|verance, in their future Conflicts; and a cautioning them again&s;t fainting under any Trials they might meet with. And &s;o his Aim &s;eems much the &s;ame with that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> in writing his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Epi&s;tle, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.17.&mdash; <HI>Beware, le&s;t ye being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s.</HI> They had &s;hewn their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s in the Faith, by re&s;i&s;ting and defeating their great Adver&s;ary: after this, it would be a Shame to them, to give Ground, and to fall from their own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s.&mdash;And partly, becau&s;e the good Impre&s;&s;ion of the Word once receiv'd is an Encouragement to hope, that the Coun&s;els and In&s;tructions of it will meet with proper Entertainment for the Time to come. <HI>I have written unto you, young Men,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle.

<PB N="30" REF="008104_0032_102E2BEA27F16338">Neutrality. As the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of Satan; &s;o you mu&s;t, of Nece&s;&s;ity, be on Chri&s;t's Side, or on Satan's. In this Ca&s;e, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>He that is not with me, is again&s;t me.</HI> (Matt. 12.30.) He will endure no Neuters; his Soul nau&s;eates luke-warm Profe&s;&s;ors; 'tis not enough, that you don't join with tho&s;e who are manife&s;tly the Children of the wicked one, in open and gro&s;s Wickedne&s;s; but you mu&s;t heartily join in with Chri&s;t, and e&s;pou&s;e his Intere&s;t, in Oppo&s;ition to the Devil and all his Works; otherwi&s;e you will be reput|ed to belong to the Camp of his Enemies. There mu&s;t be no Peace with Satan. You mu&s;t either fight or die, overcome or peri&s;h. <HI>He that overcometh,</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>&s;hall not be hurt of the &s;econd Death.</HI> (Rev. 2.11.) And what does this imply, but that all others &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of the &s;econd Death? The victorious Chri&s;tian only is ex|empted.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Seriou&s;ly and &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;i&s;t, and you &s;hall over|come. <HI>Re&s;i&s;t the Devil,</HI> and <HI>he will flee from you.</HI> Give a peremptory Denial to his Temptations, and he is defeat|ed. The Devil is a proud Spirit, and cannot bear Con|tradiction or Oppo&s;ition; therefore where he meets with an ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, he cannot endure it, but will be gone: Only be &s;tedfa&s;t in your Re&s;i&s;tance, 1 Pet. 5.9. <HI>Whom re&s;i&s;t, &s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith.</HI> A faint Re&s;i&s;tance does but embolden the Tempter to renew his On&s;et; but Sted|fa&s;tne&s;s puts him to Flight; when a Soul is re&s;olved and fix'd in oppo&s;ing his evil Motions; as it is &s;aid of <HI>Ruth,</HI> that when her Mother-in-Law &s;aw <HI>&s;he was &s;tedfa&s;tly minded to go with her, &s;he le&s;t &s;peaking unto her.</HI> (Ruth 1.18.) The Devil has &s;ome Hope of wavering unfix'd Souls; and therefore plies them mo&s;t &s;trongly with his Temptations. But when a Man is once &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;olv'd in his Mind, not to hearken to him, the Tempter is di&s;couraged. Here then, a re&s;olute and &s;tedfa&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance is Conque&s;t. It is not &s;o in other Wars, the mo&s;t valiant Re&s;i&s;tance is not al|ways crown'd with Succe&s;s and Victory; nor is the <HI>Battle</HI> always <HI>to the Strong.</HI> But in this &s;piritual War, a &s;trong
<PB N="31" REF="008104_0033_102E2BEE26344218">and per&s;evering Re&s;i&s;tance never fails of Victory. And the Rea&s;on is obvious, Satan can only tempt by the Baits of the World and the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h; he can't force your Compliance; wherefore to deny your Con&s;ent to his Solicitations, is to conquer. So here the Battle is always to the &s;trong; be &s;trong and &s;tedfa&s;t in the Fight, re&s;olv|ing never to yield, and you infallibly overcome.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Con&s;ider the mighty A&s;&s;i&s;tants engaged for you. Tho' Satan has a &s;trong Party on his Side, the Men and Things of this World, the Corruptions of our Nature, and the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, the mo&s;t dangerous of all; yet if we belong to Chri&s;t, and have him dwelling in us by his Spirit and Faith, we have One on our Side greater and mightier than all. 1 Joh. 4.4. <HI>Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World,</HI> i. e. than the Devil and all his combin'd Forces of the Fle&s;h and the World. Put your&s;elves under the Protection of this mighty Saviour (to whom all the Legions of Devils are made &s;ubject) by a true Faith, and Self-Dedication to him; and you &s;hall be &s;afe in his Hand, and find his promi&s;ed Grace and Strength &s;uffi|cient for you, to carry you on to Victory and Triumph. And the holy Angels under him are al&s;o ready to take your Part, and mini&s;ter Aid in this holy War; in which, I doubt not, they are more than bare Spectators: For <HI>are they not all mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter for them who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation?</HI> (Heb. 1.14.)</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Con&s;ider the glorious Reward promi&s;ed. Rev. 2.7. <HI>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the Tree of Life&mdash;</HI> So, ver. 10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> Eternal Life, the Life of your immortal Souls is at Stake. This is the Prize contended for. O who would not &s;trive with all his Might to win the Prize of a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality? Is not this abundant En|couragement? O <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith, and lay hold on eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>It is now a Time of War, at Home and Abroad; and the Judgments of God upon the Land in the pre&s;ent War are very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: which &s;hould awaken all to great
<PB N="32" REF="008104_0034_102E2BEFB8265808">Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and Reverence of the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure; e&s;pecially you, our young Men, &s;ome of whom it is likely may be called forth to this external Warfare with vi&s;ible potent and malicious Enemies; and if you would be for|tified again&s;t all your Fears of other Enemies, &s;et your&s;elves to encounter and overcome this grand Enemy of your Souls; which you may do by the Grace of God. And if this Enemy be once overcome, you have obtain'd the mo&s;t glorious Conque&s;t, and you need to fear no other vi&s;ible Enemies. Satan is God's Enemy, as well as yours. And if you fight again&s;t Satan, you are on God's Side, and then be a&s;&s;ured that God is on yours. And then you may boldly bid Defiance to all your Enemies, in the Language of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 128.6. <HI>The Lord is on my Side, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</HI> This will embolden your Confidence in God, in the greate&s;t Perils you may be ex|po&s;ed to from Fle&s;h and Blood.

And you can by no Means more effectually &s;ecure the di|vine Pre&s;ence, than by engaging heartily in this &s;piritual Conflict with God's great Adver&s;ary, the Devil; then you fight in God's Cau&s;e, and may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of the Protection of the Almighty. Be excited then and animated to this &s;piritual War, and pre&s;s on toward Victory and Triumph with Re&s;olution and Vigour.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Be exhorted to &s;trive for the Victory, by pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t with Re&s;olution, thro' all Oppo|&s;ition
<PB N="33" REF="008104_0035_102E2BF14EDF53C8">and Di&s;couragement, by a &s;ound and thoro' Conver|&s;ion. This the Devil oppo&s;es with all his Might; but herein he has been overcome, in the Strength of Chri&s;t, by the young Men here written to; and in a Dependance on the &s;ame Strength, you may and &s;hall get the Victory over him, if you re&s;olvedly &s;et your&s;elves to turn from all Sin, to God and Chri&s;t and Holine&s;s, by a cordial Faith, and Dedication of your &s;elves to the Government of Chri&s;t, renouncing the Fle&s;h, the World, and the Devil, with all his Works. You mu&s;t expect to meet with much Oppo&s;i|tion herein, from the Fle&s;h and the World. The&s;e are your old Lovers, from which you may find it hard to be divorced. But perhaps, you are not aware, that all your Prejudices again&s;t &s;erious Religion which hinder your Con|ver&s;ion, all your Objections again&s;t it, all your Pleas for Delays, all your Di&s;couragements ari&s;ing from the Great|ne&s;s of your Sins, Fears of being rejected, and the like, are the Sugge&s;tions of the Devil; but it is certain, that if you yield to the&s;e Pleas and Objections, when Chri&s;t earne&s;tly calls you to Repentance, Faith and Communion with him|&s;elf, and as often as you do &s;o, you give the Devil the Victory, you obey the Devil, and di&s;obey Chri&s;t; as cer|tainly, as that the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of Satan, divide the whole World. In <HI>Prov.</HI> 9. Chri&s;t and Satan are bro't in by <HI>Solomon</HI> as Competitors for the Heart of Man, e&s;pecially of young Men. Chri&s;t under the Character of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> (<HI>ver.</HI> 1.) inviting Sinners to the rich En|tertainments of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings which he hath pro|vided for them; for he deals with Men in a Way of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> by rational Motives and Arguments to engage them to a Compliance with his Calls; and he calls them to nothing but what it is their highe&s;t Wi&s;dom to comply with; he calls, <HI>For&s;ake the Fooli&s;h and live; and go in the Way of Under&s;tanding.</HI> (ver. 6.) Satan, on the other Hand, with his Agents and In&s;truments, under the Character of <HI>a fooli&s;h Woman,</HI> &s;oliciting <HI>Pa&s;&s;engers that go right on their Way,</HI> to <HI>turn in,</HI> to the Entertainments of forbidden Plea|&s;ures, which he has provided for them. (<HI>ver.</HI> 13, 15.) For
<PB N="34" REF="008104_0036_102E2BF6865A7ED0">he deals with Sinners in a Way of Fal&s;hood and Deceit, deluding and befooling them with fal&s;e (tho' plea&s;ing) Shews and Appearances, to their utter Undoing. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Hearken unto me, O ye Children; for ble&s;&s;ed are they that keep my Ways.</HI> (Prov. 8.32.) Satan &s;aith, Hearken unto me, O young Man, and thou &s;halt have Liberty to <HI>walk in the Ways</HI> of thine Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes.&mdash;But knowe&s;t thou not, that <HI>the Dead are there, and her Gue&s;ts in the Depth of Hell?</HI> O how many hopeful young Men, who to Appearance &s;et out in the right Way of Virtue and Piety, have, for want of Wi&s;dom, Caution and Re&s;olution, been decoyed into the Snares of Satan to their final Ruin, and are in vain lamenting, in the Region of De&s;pair, their cur&s;ed folly, in hearkning to his Delu&s;ions. But now, if in a Sen&s;e of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Chri&s;t's Precepts and Invitations, and under deep Con|viction of the important Intere&s;ts of your immortal Souls, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;peedily what in you lies to prevent their eternal Ruin, and &s;ecure their eternal Wel|fare, you &s;et your&s;elves in the Strength of divine Grace, to break thro' all this Oppo&s;ition from Satan and your own corrupt Hearts, and with a &s;teady Zeal and Re&s;olution pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God, renouncing the Dominion of Sin and Satan, and re&s;olvedly and unfeignedly dedicating your&s;elves to God and his Service, by Faith in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;o doing you overcome the wicked one; you have already gotten a &s;ignal Victory over Satan, greatly to the Honour and Plea&s;ure of your Redeemer, and glo|rious to your&s;elves. And I willingly hope, as to a Number of you, at lea&s;t, the Commendation given the young Men in the Text may be truly applied; that you have been &s;trengthened by the Word and Spirit of Grace, to get the better of the wicked one, by a penitent Return to God thro' Faith in Chri&s;t; and as to all of you, that you are &s;etting your Faces with Re&s;olution to &s;eek the Way to the Kingdom of God, the heavenly Zion; &s;o that if not converted, you are in the Way to Conver&s;ion: O be per|&s;uaded and encouraged to go on to a thorough Conver&s;ion,
<PB N="35" REF="008104_0037_102E2BF90A2CBC80">&s;urmounting all the Difficulties and Impediments your great Adver&s;ary ca&s;ts in your Way; which you may do in the Name and Strength of Chri&s;t, who has overcome Sa|tan, and led Captivity captive. Put your&s;elves over into his Hand, by an humble &s;elf-dedicating Faith, and adhere &s;tedfa&s;tly to his Intere&s;t, as good Soldiers of Chri&s;t, fol|lowing the Captain of your Salvation, and he will infallibly give you the Victory. And let this your Conver&s;ion be made more evident, to your own and others Satisfaction, by a more &s;olemn and publick Dedication of your&s;elves to him. Be not a&s;hamed to declare openly for Chri&s;t and his Cau&s;e, and again&s;t Satan and all his Works and Lu&s;ts. This will afford Matter of Joy to Heaven, which will re|&s;ound with Applau&s;es and Acclamations upon this Victory over Satan. Our Saviour tells us, there is <HI>Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth.</HI> (Luk. 15.7.) All will be well plea&s;ed there, God and Chri&s;t, and Angels. The holy Angels rejoice at a Sinner's Conver&s;ion. (<HI>ver.</HI> 10.) 'Tis Joy to them to &s;ee the Ruin of the Devil's Kingdom, and the Enlargement of the Church and Kingdom of Chri&s;t; they rejoice al&s;o from a generous Love and Good-will they bear to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I am now to exhort you <HI>to &s;trive for the Ma&s;tery,</HI> by re&s;i&s;ting the particular Temptations of the Devil, wherewith he may a&s;&s;ault you, even after your Conver&s;ion. And by an effectual Re&s;i&s;tance you may get the Victory, yea, many Victories over him in this Life. But here con&s;ider, that as the Devil encounters you by the Lu&s;ts and Corruptions of your own Hearts, and cannot fa&s;ten one Temptation upon you, but as he finds a corrupt Party within your&s;elves, ready to yield a Compliance with it; &s;o your main Care and Bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be to re&s;i&s;t and &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e <HI>fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul</HI> (1 Pet. 2.11.) as being the Party which holds with Satan again&s;t your immortal Souls. And your effectual Re&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e corrupt Lu&s;ts, is your Victory over Satan; for he is overcome by &s;uch Re&s;i&s;tance. Here then, you mu&s;t exert your&s;elves with Strength and vigorous Re&s;olution in
<PB N="36" REF="008104_0038_102E2BFE2BFECD58">contending for the Dominion of Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, over carnal. Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions; and to that End, mu&s;t exer|ci&s;e your&s;elves in Sobriety and Temperance, Self-denial, Prayer and Watchfulne&s;s, &s;triving to <HI>keep under the Body,</HI> with it's inordinate Affections, <HI>bringing it into Subjection</HI> to the Law of the Mind, as the Apo&s;tle has directed you, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25,&mdash;27. But there is al&s;o another Way to be recommended, for overcoming Satan's Temptations and the Lu&s;ts of your own Hearts, that is, by Flight. Hence are tho&s;e Coun&s;els and Directions to Chri&s;tians, <HI>Flee Fornica|tion.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.18. <HI>Flee youthful Lu&s;ts.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.22. Fly from the Sin you are tempted to, with Abhorrence: hold no Party with Satan, nor debate the Matter, whether you had be&s;t yield, or forbear; but be re&s;olute and peremp|tory in giving a Denial. This will put a Stop to Satan's Attempts, and wholly defeat them. Hence we are taught to <HI>deny worldly Lu&s;ts</HI> (2 Tit. 2.12.) to deny their importunate Cravings. And not only to forbear the Gratification of them, but as much as in us lies to extirpate the Lu&s;ts them&s;elves. <HI>Ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts.</HI> (1 Pet. 2.11.) Labour to get rid of the&s;e Lu&s;ts, to weaken them more and more in the Work of Mortification, which is the great Duty and con&s;tant Practice of all real Chri&s;tians; for <HI>they that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the Fle&s;h with the Affections and Lu&s;ts.</HI> (Gal. 5.24.) The greater Progre&s;s you make in your Mortification of the&s;e Lu&s;ts, the le&s;s will be your Danger from Satan's Temptations, and the more compleat will be your Victory over them, Therefore arm your&s;elves with &s;trong Re&s;olutions to re&s;i&s;t Temptations, and mortify Corruptions, and &s;o to defear and vanqui&s;h this Enemy of your Souls.</P>
<P>This Conflict with Satan, and Victory over him, is not an airy Notion, but an undoubted Reality (and therefore we are to <HI>fight, not as beating the Air</HI>) tho' the Evidence of this depends chiefly on divine Revelation. Thence we are a&s;&s;ured, there are va&s;t Numbers of apo&s;tate wicked Spi|rits, who are irreconcilable Enemies to God and Chri&s;t, and all Goodne&s;s; and particularly to the Souls of Men,
<PB N="37" REF="008104_0039_102E2C027B972468">and their Salvation; which is atte&s;ted by the &s;ad Experience of many poor Souls. And we are therein often warn'd of our Danger from them, and directed to proper Methods for our Security. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> calls upon us to <HI>be &s;ober</HI> and <HI>vigilant; becau&s;e</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>your Adver&s;ary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about; &s;eeking whom he may devour,</HI> (1 Pet. 5.8.) Which was not only true of that Age in which the Apo&s;tle wrote, but even to this Day. This great Adver&s;ary of God and Man is unweariedly active and indu&s;trious in the Pur&s;uit of his blood-thir&s;ty De&s;ign, going about like a ravenous Bea&s;t of Prey, hunting for the precious Life, even the Life of precious immortal Souls. Nothing le&s;s will &s;atisfy his Malice. Wherefore, to a|waken your Vigilance and Caution, let me put you upon con&s;idering the Nature and De&s;ign of this your Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As to his Nature, he is an active, malicious, powerful and wicked Spirit, or rather <HI>Spirits,</HI> in the plural, for (as has been ob&s;erved) there is an innumerable Com|pany of them: And the Name <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to be a col|lective Term, and applied to the whole Crew. The Apo|&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> terms them <HI>&s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>wicked Spirits,</HI> Eph. 6.12. <HI>We wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood,</HI> but again&s;t wicked <HI>Spirits;</HI> which &s;hews our Danger, in that our Enemy is of a &s;piritual Nature. Were we to con|flict only with Fle&s;h and Blood, with Men like our&s;elves, bodily Strength, which is mo&s;t vigorous in young Men, would be of mo&s;t Service to us; but this Warfare is of a &s;piritual Nature, and requires &s;piritual Strength, Wi&s;dom Faith, Sobriety, Watchfulne&s;s, Re&s;olution. For the Ene|mies with whom we are to combat, are wicked Spirits; the Devils are Spirits, invi&s;ible to us, and wicked Spirits. And our Danger is the greater from our Enemies, becau&s;e they are un&s;een, and a&s;&s;ault us ere we are aware of them. Satan is ready to take Men at a Di&s;advantage, when they are off their Guard, when their Spirits are ruffled, in their Company, Bu&s;ine&s;s, Enjoyments, when they are lea&s;t aware of this invi&s;ible Foe at Hand; and being a Spirit, he is able to in&s;inuate into your Fancies, bodily Tempers, Affections,
<PB N="38" REF="008104_0040_102E2C0531AA8DC8">Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions; and ob&s;erves which Way all the&s;e work, that he might &s;uit his Temptations accordingly, and the more ea&s;ily obtrude his cur&s;ed Baits upon you: which is a Rea&s;on, you &s;ee, why you &s;hould be always upon your Watch, and never give Way to Security.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Let me put you in Mind of the helli&s;h pernicious De&s;ign of this your Adver&s;ary in all his Temptations; which is, to prevail with you to &s;in again&s;t God, that he might prevail again&s;t you to the Ruin of your precious Souls. Ju&s;tly therefore is he called <HI>the wicked one,</HI> it being his great Aim to entice you to Wickedne&s;s, and to hinder your Repentance; and then he knows, the &s;mal I&s;&s;ue will be your eternal Damnation. There is this Difference, in Relation to Sin, between the Devil, and Sinners of Mankind. The Devil's <HI>End</HI> is &s;inning: but with Men &s;inning is ordinarily the <HI>Means</HI> to &s;ome other End. While you are pur&s;uing the Imaginations of the earnal Heart, you don't aim at &s;inning again&s;t God, or &s;in for &s;inning &s;ake, out of pure Enmity to God and Holine&s;s, which is the right diabolical Temper; but your Aim is at the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, the Gratification of the Fle&s;h, or the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoyment of the World, and you would doubtle&s;s chu&s;e to have the&s;e De&s;ires gratified, if it might be, upon ca&s;ter Terms, than &s;inning again&s;t God, and wounding your own Con&s;ciences. But becau&s;e your Minds and Hearts are &s;et upon the&s;e Things, and carried out with a &s;trong Inclination towards them, and cannot obtain them without Sin, therefore it is that you are prevail'd upon to &s;in, and break the Law of God. But the Devil has a further Reach, he aims at your Sin and Ruin, and &s;o he has a two-fold De&s;ign which is &s;erved hereby. The one is again&s;t God, to expre&s;s his malicious Enmity again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed God, by bringing you to di&s;honour him by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his Law. The other is again&s;t your own Souls, that by the Baits of worldly Temptations &s;uired to your Lu&s;ts, he might bring you into his Snares, and plunge your Souls in Perdition. This he pur&s;ues with a blood-thir&s;ty Eagerne&s;s in all his Temptations, which &s;hould awaken you to
<PB N="39" REF="008104_0041_102E2C085E1BEE78">a con&s;tant Sen&s;e of your Danger, and to a vigorous Re|&s;i&s;tance, whenever a Temptation &s;trongly in&s;inuates it&s;elf into your Minds and Affections; for remembert, hat nothing le&s;s than your precious immortal Souls are the Prize, which the Devil is thereby contending for.</P>
<P>Now that you may be &s;trong in &s;pirit for this &s;piritual Warfare, let the Word of God dwell and rule in your Hearts. Not only give it a tran&s;ient Hearing, but let it, in the important Sen&s;e and Weight of it, &s;ink into your Hearts, and form within you a corre&s;pondent Temper. Let it be dige&s;ted by Faith and Meditation, that it may be|come proper Nouri&s;hment and Strength to your Souls, and produce and &s;trengthen tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Principles of Faith, Love and Hope, which in their genuine lively Exerci&s;e will be found Armour of Proof again&s;t all the A&s;&s;aults of your &s;piritual Enemies. Get your Minds and Hearts &s;tored with the holy Coun&s;els, Precepts and In&s;tructions of the Word: which will abundantly furni&s;h you with &s;trong Rea|&s;ons, to oppo&s;e to all the &s;ubtle Devices and Allurements of the Tempter; that you may have always this Weapon of your Warfare, <HI>the Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God,</HI> in a Readine&s;s to repel the Temptations and fiery Darts of the wicked one: And that in Imitation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour (when tempted by the Devil) you may be able to re&s;i&s;t and put to flight this great Adver&s;ary, with&mdash;<HI>It is written.</HI> Thus when in Danger of being lifted up with Pride, &s;ay, It is written, <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud.</HI> (1 Pet. 5.5.)

Thus let the <HI>Sword of the Spirit</HI> be pointed again&s;t every Sin that &s;olicits your Affec|tions, and let Faith have the wielding of it; and the Temp|ter mu&s;t flee before it. Only let me caution you again&s;t the prevailing Errors of the Times, whereby the pure Word of God is corrupted, and Satan &s;eeks to blunt the Edge of our Weapon, or to di&s;arm us of our main Strength and Defence. But 'tis <HI>Truth</HI> which is great and &s;trong: <HI>Stand therefore having your Loins girt about with Truth,</HI> the Truth <HI>as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> according as you have been taught; and <HI>beware le&s;t</HI> any of you <HI>being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Sted&s;a&s;tne&s;s.</HI></P>

You are to ob&s;erve his Caution again&s;t Sin. <HI>Ver.</HI> I. <HI>My little Children, the&s;e Things write I unto you, that ye &s;in not.</HI> 'Tis the Scope of the whole Scripture, as well as of this Epi&s;tle, to take us off from Sin, and to engage us again&s;t it. This therefore ought to be your fir&s;t and main Concern, to keep your&s;elves from Sin, from all Sin: in &s;o doing you will mo&s;t effectually defeat the great De|&s;ign of the wicked one, which is to &s;educe you to Sin and Wickedne&s;s. But by every known wilful Sin you com|mit, you do, as it were, &s;urrender your&s;elves Captives to the Devil. O then, let little Children, young Men, and all, be exhorted to keep up a Dread of Sin, and keep at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from it.</P>

2. Under a Sen&s;e and Conviction of Sin, you are di|rected to the Advocacy and Propitiation of Chri&s;t, in order to Pardon and Reconciliation to God. <HI>Ver.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>If any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> Forasmuch as <HI>there is no Man that &s;inneth not;</HI> and Sins of daily Infirmity will unavoidably attend us in this mortal State; therefore the true and only Method of Relief a|gain&s;t Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt, is he repointed out to us; which is, repairing to Je&s;us Chri&s;t our great <HI>Advocate</HI> in Hea|ven, looking by Faith to the <HI>Propitiation</HI> in his Blood. An Advocate is one who patroni&s;es and pleads the Cau&s;e of an accu&s;ed Party, before any Bar of Ju&s;tice. So Je&s;us Chri&s;t pleads our Cau&s;e with his Father, again&s;t the Charge of Guilt, again&s;t the Accu&s;ations of Satan and our own Con&s;ciences, in the Virtue of his own Merit, or of that propitiatory Sacrifice he once offered on Earth, to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and &s;o &s;ecures our Peace; that notwith&s;tanding our daily &s;inful Infirmities, we might yet (our Hearts being, in the main, right with God) main|tain &s;ettled Peace and Comfort, in our Walk with God. Or, if it &s;hould be your unhappy Lot at any Time (as it may be, and that even contrary to the &s;ettled Bent of your Judgments and Re&s;olutions) to be foil'd by your Adver&s;a|ry, and to fall into any more grievous Sin, to the Di&s;tre&s;s of your Con&s;ciences; yet having &s;uch a &s;overeign Remedy provided and offered to you, de&s;pair not, but fly to the Pro|tection of your Advocate and Mediator; and with deep Humiliation and Contrition of Soul, and by Faith and Prayer plead with God, the Propitiation in the Blood of Chri&s;t, for the Pardon of your Guilt, and the Healing of your Back&s;lidings; but be not di&s;couraged from per&s;i&s;ting in your Warfare; but in Dependance on divine Grace and Strength, ri&s;e again from your Falls, and renew the Com|bat with fre&s;h Vigour, and with greater Wi&s;dom, Watch|fulne&s;s, and Re&s;olution never to yield: and you may be victorious at la&s;t; as a General may lo&s;e a Battle in &s;ome particular Skirmi&s;hes, and yet come off Conqueror in the I&s;&s;ue of War.</P>

<P>And here, &s;uffer me &s;eriou&s;ly and earne&s;tly to pre&s;s it upon you, to improve this great Go&s;pel-Privilege of the Propitiation or Atonement in the Blood of Chri&s;t, in order to get into a State of Peace, and Reconciliation with God up|on the Terms of the Go&s;pel. O how much does it con|cern you, who may be called to war with Enemies a|broad, now to get your Peace made with God? And &s;o to get <HI>your Feet &s;hod</HI> before-hand, <HI>with the Preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace</HI> (which is directed to as Part of our &s;piri|tual Armour) by &s;ecuring an Intere&s;t in that Peace which the Go&s;pel publi&s;hes and offers to you. This will &s;ecure you again&s;t all the Chances of War. The Devil will be an Enemy to you, whether you be &s;o to him, or not. And how dreadful will it be, to have God for your Enemy, and the Devil too: And all Creatures in Heaven, Earth and Hell, in Con&s;equence of God's being your Enemy! Till you are reconciled, <HI>the Wrath of God abideth</HI> on you: And can you bear the Tho't of lying under the Wrath of an eternal God! But O precious immortal Souls! (for as &s;uch I &s;peak to you, in treating with you about the Things of your everla&s;ting Peace) precious, becau&s;e immortal. Of what infinite Importance is that reconciled Favour and Love of an eternal God, to an immortal Soul! This will be your Security and Felicity in Life, in Death, and to Eter|nity. O then, <HI>acquaint now thy &s;elf with him, and be at Peace, thereby Good &s;hall come unto thee.</HI> (Job. 22.21.) Nothing but what is Good, or works for Good, &s;hall be|fall you; this &s;hould rai&s;e you above the Terrors of your Enemies. Yea, tho' you &s;hould fall in Batrie, as good <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> did, yet you &s;hall die in Peace, as God promi&s;ed him. (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34.28.) Now, that God is very willing and de&s;irous of entering into Terms of Peace with you, ap|pears from his &s;ending <HI>his Son to be a Propitiation,</HI> or re|conciling Sacrifice, <HI>for our Sins.</HI> (1 Joh. 4.10.) And from
<PB N="43" REF="008104_0045_102E2C10E5A21438">that moving Language of the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>As tho' God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI> O let not your Con&s;ent be want|ing to the Terms of this Peace, who will be the only Gain|ers by it. Lay a&s;ide your Enmity, and &s;ubmit to the Scep|tre of Grace. Let this be your Aim and Pur&s;uit. <HI>And the Peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding, &s;hall keep your Hearts and Minds thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The new Commandment of Love is inforced more largely, <HI>Ver.</HI> 5,&mdash;11. This is an excellent Chri&s;tian Virtue often recommended, in which the true Spirit of Chri&s;tia|nity is chiefly manife&s;ted. It is the Nature and Image of God our heavenly Father; as the contrary, Malice and Uncharitablene&s;s, is of the Devil, and therefore to be ab|horred in every Shape, by tho&s;e who have renounced the Devil and his Works. There is a general Love, to be ex|tended to all Men, in various In&s;tances and Degrees; but a more &s;pecial Love towards Chri&s;tian Brethren, and more particularly towards tho&s;e of your own Society, and with whom you commonly conver&s;e. Let this your Love be generous, pure, cordial and undi&s;&s;embled. Let it be not only a Love of common Friend&s;hip or Cource&s;y; but a truly religious Love. Let it be manife&s;ted in coun&s;elling, exhorting, reproving, and edifying one another in the Ways of Religion; in forbearing and forgiving one another; in praying with and for one another. Thus the true Spirit of Chri&s;tian Love will operate, and evidence it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Caution again&s;t immoderate Love of the World, here fitly &s;ubjoin'd. <HI>Ver.</HI> 15. <HI>Love not the World, nor the Things of the World,</HI> &amp;c. Becau&s;e the World, and the Things of it, are the common Baits wherewith the Devil &s;eeks to &s;educe and en&s;nare the Souls of Men; and young Men are mo&s;t in Danger of this Snare. While they are &s;et|ting out in the World, and &s;eeking after Settlements and Accommodations in it, they are too apt to &s;uffer their Hearts, by worldly Cares and Bu&s;ine&s;s, to be e&s;tranged from God, and the &s;erious Concerns of Religion; and thereby give the Adver&s;ary great Advantage again&s;t them,
<PB N="44" REF="008104_0046_102E2C14F5EDB9A0">to lead them a&s;tray by <HI>many fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts,</HI> which without a &s;peedy Recovery by Faith and Repen|tance, will <HI>drown them in De&s;truction and Perdition.</HI> (1 Tim. 6.9.) You may, doubtle&s;s, lawfully u&s;e the World, attend the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World in your &s;everal Callings, and enjoy the Comforts of the World: &s;trict Re|ligion allows and requires all this; but all in Subordination to higher and better Things, for which you ought to re|&s;erve the chief Room in your Affections: that Love to the World, and di&s;tracting Cares about it, may not divert your Attention from the <HI>one Thing needful.</HI> Labour therefore to get worldly Love mortify'd. To this End, meditate much on the Death of Chri&s;t: one De&s;ign whereof was, to deliver you from <HI>this pre&s;ent evil World,</HI> and that <HI>the World</HI> might be <HI>crucified to</HI> you, and you <HI>to the World.</HI> (Gal. 1.4. &amp; 6.14.) Think much on your own Death, and live in the daily Views of it, as &s;ure and near; when all that is &s;o much admir'd in this World, &s;hall vani&s;h as a Dream. What is it, that makes Death &s;o bitter and dread|ful, but an Heart too &s;trongly attached to this World, and corrupted by the Lu&s;ts of it? But the Mortification of world|ly Love carries with it Victory over Satan and Death. Let us learn then, to place our Affections on Objects more no|ble and &s;ublime, more worthy of an immortal Soul. Let us rai&s;e our Souls to God and the Things of Heaven, by Faith and Meditation, and &s;piritual A&s;pirations. <HI>Unto thee, O Lord,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 25.1.) <HI>do I lift up my Soul.</HI> A Spirit of true Devotion lifts up the Soul to God. Let us then hold on a Cour&s;e of holy Devotion, by daily Pray|er and Prai&s;e, and Conver&s;e with God in his Word and Or|dinances; which will be an happy Preparation for the Soul's Return to God at Death; that when our Warfare is accom|pli&s;hed, it may return victorious, and our immortal Spirit being loo&s;ened from this Clod of Earth, by a previous Work of Mortification, may, upon the Di&s;&s;olution of this earthly Tabernacle, mount up to the heavenly Paradi&s;e, and eat of the Tree of Life and live for ever.</P>
