<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING already addre&s;&s;ed you upon the like Errand with our pre&s;ent one, we &s;hall not make any long Apology at this Time, judging it need|le&s;s; becau&s;e we tru&s;t we have already given you &s;ome Proof of the Goodne&s;s and Hone&s;ty of our De&s;ign, in &s;peaking our Part in this publick Manner, in the Defence of de&s;pi&s;ed Truth and Order, again&s;t the Errors and Di&s;orders of the Times. It is enough (we &s;uppo&s;e) to tell you, that we de&s;ign to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame Cau&s;e at this Time: For tho' we are &s;en&s;ible, by late Experience, that we cannot e&s;cape the La&s;h of virukent Tongues, if we &s;peak Truth without Di&s;gui&s;e, as formerly; yet we are in great hopes, that our &s;peaking the Truth without Palliation, will prevent our fal|ling under the &s;everer Stings of our own Con&s;ciences; when Times appear &s;uch, that the Lovers of Truth cannot be &s;ilent and innocent. We entirely agree with a Paragraph in a lace Writer, who &s;aith, <Q>That &s;uch as are Friends to Liberty, will find it equally nece&s;&s;ary to be Friends to the Principles of the Reformation: I am, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> always of Opinion, that Pro|te&s;tant Liberty and Prote&s;tant religious Truths are clo&s;ely linked together, and together mu&s;t &s;tand or fall. The Refor|mation can only &s;ub&s;i&s;t and flouri&s;h by the Principles it began upon: Every thing el&s;e, in &s;ome Shape or other, tends to Po|pery and Slavery. There is a fal&s;e Policy in the World, an over-valued Learning and mi&s;taken Wi&s;dom: Nothing ex|cept Con&s;i&s;tency will bear Examination. Truth only is great,

and at one Time or other will prevail.</Q> Upon this Score we are much &s;urpriz'd at the Conduct of many di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants among us, who (tho' they &s;eem'd lately zealous for Prote&s;tant Principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) are all on a &s;udden, either for Want of Judgment or Con&s;ideration, fallen into an uncommon Liking and Admiration of Mr <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s patched, and in many Places, fal&s;e Scheme, as we have already &s;hewn; which to the con&s;iderate Ob&s;erver carries in it (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we think) as plain a De&s;ign again&s;t Prote&s;tant Principles, as the <HI>Interim</HI> of Old, in <HI>Germany,</HI> in King <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI>'s Times did.</P>
<P>We cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook upon it as a plain Proof of Men's Fickle|ne&s;s and Want of Judgment, or of their Want of right Attach|ment to Pre&s;byterian, or even to true Prote&s;tant Principles, that &s;uch an enthu&s;ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tick, incoherent, and in &s;ome Places, vain and fabulous Scheme, &s;melling &s;o rankly of Popery, &s;hould all on a &s;udden prevail among Non-conformi&s;ts, after all their Scuffle with Conformi&s;ts about Popi&s;h Relicts: For what is Popery, if a&s;cribing to the holy Scriptures a two-fold Sen&s;e, viz. a literal and my&s;tical or hidden Sen&s;e, and a&s;&s;erting, that Sacraments are e&s;&s;ential Means of Salvation, &amp;c. be not true Popi&s;h Dialect: And where but here can we rank Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s &s;uper&s;titious fa&s;ting&punc; on <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> Phari&s;ee and Popi&s;h like, as well as on the holy Sea&s;on of Lent, as he calls it? And what but a popi&s;h Penance was his ab&s;taining from eating of Pyes, wearing woollen Gloves, patched Gown and dirty Shoes; what could this be, but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind of voluntary&punc; Humility, of which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks in <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 18? What Reward can Men expect from God for &s;uch vain Super&s;titions; but <HI>who hath required this at your Hands?</HI> as <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 12. What but monki&s;h Holine&s;s can be promoted by &s;uch Dirt? Can any &s;uppo&s;e that the holy One, who once injoined divers bodily Purifications or Wa&s;hings, in order to in&s;truct Men in the &s;piritual Le&s;&s;on of Soul Purifica|tion, in which his Soul delights, hath any where injoined Men to wallow in Dirt, in order to make their Souls clean? But what but monki&s;h Holine&s;s can be expected in a &s;eeming Con|vert and profe&s;&s;ed Admirer of <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpis?</HI> For is not Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> &s;uch, if the Account he gives of him&s;elf be true? It is very remarkable, that a Party among us, who having imbibed &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tick Notions, and do on that Account judge and pro|claim them&s;elves our only &s;piritual Men, condemning all that differ from them for carnal Men and Hypocrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are very in|du&s;trious

to e&s;tabli&s;h Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Character, and to propa|gate the Credit of his Scheme, and al&s;o to palliate and defend his Errors: and Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> makes grateful Return to them <HI>in Specie;</HI> and this puts us in Mind of an old Story, which we read &s;omewhere; How that <HI>Sanctius,</HI> the King of <HI>Arragon</HI>'s Brother, who marching again&s;t the <HI>Saracens,</HI> diverted him&s;elf a while at <HI>Rome:</HI> The bountiful Pope, who is always prodigal of what co&s;ts him Nothing, cau&s;es him to be proclaimed, <HI>Sanctius,</HI> by the Grace of God, <HI>King of Egypt, &amp;c.</HI> The Noi&s;e of the Trumpets calls him to the Balcony, and he a&s;ks, what was the Matter? He was an&s;wered, that his Holine&s;s had pre&s;ented him with the entire Kingdom of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Pre&s;ently he commands his own Trumpeters, to go and &s;alute the Pope, in Requital, <HI>Caliph of Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h.</HI> How like this are the Proclamations made among us at Sea&s;ons, we leave others to determine, only we &s;hall take Notice, that it hath been ob&s;erved. That when it is Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>'s Turn to &s;peak, then Mr. <HI>G. Tennent</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>mo&s;t able and mo&s;t eminent Servant of Chri&s;t, and all his A&s;&s;ociates or Party &s;piritual Men and faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> On the other Hand, if their Turn comes to &s;peak or write, then Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>mo&s;t able and mo&s;t eminent Ser|vant of Chri&s;t:</HI> Whereas, by his Writings he appears to be ei|ther weak or wor&s;e; How el&s;e comes it to pa&s;s, that the&s;e are &s;o incoherent, empty, vain and trifling, and even fabulous in many Places, as we have partly &s;hewn already? When there is &s;uch an Hue and Cry after Phari&s;ees, we would be glad to know, whether it would be &s;afe for the other Side to trumpet one ano|ther's Prai&s;es &s;o loudly and highly as this Side doth, without be|ing in Danger of being taken up for Phari&s;ees, and having the <HI>Crow's Eggs</HI> ca&s;t in their Teeth? Becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;aith to tho&s;e Phari&s;ees that were offended at him for healing a Man on the Sabbath, <HI>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another? John</HI> v. 44.

For, according to the old Rule, two Suns in the Firmament is one too many, becau&s;e ominous. It was remark|able, how highly Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> publickly did commend Mr. <HI>G. Tennent</HI>'s printed Sermon, preached at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> of the <HI>Danger of an Unconverted Mini&s;try,</HI> as an excellent Piece, and as be judged, an unan&s;werable one: This, together with the
<PB N="6" REF="004792_0004_100DED96D21C7598">
general Applau&s;e given to the &s;aid Sermon, by many of our Party-Zealots, &s;o far influenced us, as to incite us to read &s;aid Ser|mon again; and upon the be&s;t Peru&s;al we could make of it, we are &s;o far di&s;appointed, that tho' Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> in &s;ome of his former Sermons, gave us tolerable Satisfaction; yet in this he &s;eems to us to have fallen into &s;everal palpable and unhappy Mi&s;takes, which have influenc'd him (as we think) to expre&s;s him&s;elf otherwi&s;e than according to Truth, and Chri&s;tian Chari|ty: if we have been any Ways mi&s;taken herein, we are very willing to &s;ubmit the Paragraphs we have extracted, and our Re|marks thereupon, to your more mature Judgments. To proceed then in Order, we &s;hall in the fir&s;t Place take a cur&s;ory View of the <HI>Epi&s;tle Dedicatory,</HI> &s;o that we may make an orderly Entrance, and let us come out as we can.</P>
<P N="1">I. Epi&s;tle Dedicatory, Paragraph the Fir&s;t, <HI>"I thought it proper to dedicate to you the following Sermon, which I have deli|vered among you, as a Te&s;timony of my Regard for you, and De&s;ire that you might be directed in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, that &s;o that important Affair might be managed to your &s;piritual and immortal Benefit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. When it was Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s profe&s;&s;ed Aim to direct the People of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, doth not he &s;eem to be very deficient in giving them proper Directions for that Purpo&s;e? For what can we find, that looks like Directions, but the following Paragraph in pag. 30, 31. <HI>And O! that vacant Congregations would take due Care in the Choice of their Mini&s;ters! Here indeed they &s;hould ha&s;ten &s;lowly. The Church of</HI> Ephe&s;us <HI>is commended for trying them which &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and were not, and for finding them Liars. Hypocrites are again&s;t all know|ing of others, and judging, in order to hide their own Filthine&s;s; like Thieves they flee the Search, becau&s;e of their &s;tolen Goods: But the more they endeavour to hide, the more they expo&s;e their Shame. Does not the &s;piritual Man judge all Things? Tho' he cannot judge the E&s;tate of &s;ubtle Hypocrites infallibly; yet may he not give a near Gue&s;s, who are the Sons of</HI> Sceva, <HI>by their Manner of Praying, Preaching, and Living? Many Phari&s;ee-Teachers have got a fine long String of Prayings by Heart, &s;o that they are never at a Lo&s;s about it; their Prayers and Preachings are generally of a Length, and both as dead as a Stone, and without all Savour.</HI> Dixi.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. Tho' we join with Mr. <HI>Tennent, That vacant Con|gregations &s;hould take due Care in the Choice of their Mini&s;ters;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004792_0004_100DED96D21C7598">
it being a weighty Concern of the greate&s;t Importance on many Accounts; yet we wou'd ask, What &s;ort of a Proof of due Care is ha&s;tening &s;lowly? or how will both con&s;i&s;t? For is not the Danger of tho&s;e Sheep that want a Shepherd great, as well as that of tho&s;e who have only unconverted Mini&s;ters? For is not a dry Mor&s;el, or half a Loaf, better than no Bread? And is not the Privilege of a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, &s;o precious, as to de&s;erve all po&s;&s;ible Speed in procuring it? Or is it &s;uppo&s;ed, that a &s;ettled Mini&s;ter will &s;tand in the Itinerant's Way or Light? If there be any &s;uch &s;piritual Men in vacant Congregations, as can on the bare Hearing of the Declaration of Men's Experiences, pre&s;ently tell, whether they are carnal or converted; where is the Prudence or Care in being tardy, when it can be di&s;patch'd to a good Purpo&s;e at once? Or if the Members of vacant Con|gregations dare not tru&s;t their own Skill herein; would it not be a good Deed, if the Congregation be able, to pay <HI>Ten</HI> or <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> to a new-fa&s;hion'd <HI>Rabbi,</HI> for a Vi&s;it, who can in an Hour or two, by keeping a Judgment-Meeting, gue&s;s the Matter at once, and then pronounce the Judgment with as much Authority, as if he &s;at in <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair? Or if the Congregation be poor, would it not be a Deed of Charity in &s;uch Rabbies, to give a vacant Congregation &s;uch a Vi&s;it <HI>gratis,</HI> or only upon their paying a &s;mall Modicum to bear the Charges of their Journey? And when in &s;ettled Congregations every Member is &s;uppo&s;ed to be endowed with pre&s;ent Skill, to judge the Itinerant more gifted and gracious, and the Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter le&s;s gifted or carnal, How comes it to pa&s;s, that a whole Con|gregation, when vacant, are or ought to be at a long Stand before they can po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s the Point; unle&s;s it be that the carnal Mini&s;ter, upon his Removal, hath carried away the <HI>Urim and Thummim,</HI> out of the Bounds, among the re&s;t of his <HI>&s;tolen Goods;</HI> and the People, tho' they have Materials to make new ones, yet for want of a Leader, mu&s;t &s;pend a long Time in melting and forging them out? Or is this to &s;uit their Matter to People's Inclinations, who naturally ca&s;t off, but are &s;low to take on them Chri&s;t's ea&s;y Yoke?</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> III. We grant, <HI>That the Church of</HI> Ephe&s;us <HI>was ju&s;tly commended for trying them which &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and were not, and for finding them Liars.</HI> Why then &s;hould tho&s;e Mini&s;ters and Congregations be di&s;commended by &s;ome, who &s;u&s;pect &s;uch ordinary Mini&s;ters, who put them&s;elves in a Level with Chri&s;t's
<PB N="8" REF="004792_0005_100DED9A65AE1A58">
Apo&s;tles, if not with Chri&s;t him&s;elf, at Sea&s;ons, by pretending to an immediate Call and Mi&s;&s;ion to the Mini&s;try, to cloak their Di&s;orders and Want of Conformity to Go&s;pel Rules; and pre|tend to act and think by the immediate Guidance of Divine In&s;piration, to palliate Errors and Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Rovings; yea, who pretend to have done greater Things than Rai&s;ing dead Bodies, for Proof of their pretended inward Manife&s;tations; when in Reality there is nothing done, but an artificial Rai&s;ing of the tender Pa&s;&s;ions of the weaker Ve&s;&s;els, and making of Parties and Factions, by glaring Sights, Sounds and vain Boa&s;t|ings? Will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, what Names &s;uch high Pretenders de&s;erve? For if by <HI>the Sons of Sceva,</HI> Mr. <HI>T.</HI> means fal&s;e Pretenders to extraordinary Gifts and Works, we will readily grant, that by the Help of Scripture-Rule, by the vi&s;ible Failure of their Performances, and the Names of Bla&s;phemy written in their Foreheads, Men may do &s;omething more than give <HI>a near Gue&s;s</HI> who are &s;uch; for if there was not &s;ome &s;ure Way to know &s;uch Impo&s;tors, how &s;hould it be impo&s;&s;ible to deceive the Elect?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> IV. Whereas Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> affirms, <HI>That Hypocrites are again&s;t all knowing and judging of others, in order to hide their own Filthine&s;s:</HI> What Allowance is to be made to different Climates, or whether Antipodes are endued with Di&s;po&s;itions as oppo&s;ite as their Situations are to each other, we will leave to long Heads; but we would de&s;ire to know, in what World do tho&s;e Men live, that are <HI>again&s;t all knowing of others?</HI> Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Hermits and Amazons are arrived to this Pitch of Hypocri&s;y? Or what Sect is that among Chri&s;tians, that are again&s;t all judging of others? For is not there a wide Difference between Men's being again&s;t po&s;itive and peremptory judging of Men's carnal or gracious State, and their being again&s;t all judging of others? For may not &s;uch hold their Duty to make a probable Judgment of others, without contradicting them&s;elves in the lea&s;t? May not Men be again&s;t judging the Hearts of others, becau&s;e it is their firm Belief, that God alone is Judge concerning Regeneration, as to its internal real Principle and State in Men's Souls; and yet hold it their Duty to judge of its Evidences and Fruits in their external Demon&s;tration, &s;till leaving the Heart to God? May not Men be again&s;t making the &s;ecret State of Men's Souls towards God, the Foundation of Judgment concerning them, becau&s;e &s;ecret Things belong to God;
<PB N="9" REF="004792_0005_100DED9A65AE1A58">
yet judge it their Duty &s;o far to judge Men's Doctrines and Profe&s;&s;ions, and their Deportment, as to be able to make a probable Judgment of Men's &s;ecret State, as a Conclu&s;ion inferred from the Judgment they are called to make of the Fruits and Evidences of Grace in their external Demon&s;tration or Appear|ance? But if it were &s;o, that Hypocrites are again&s;t all knowing of others; how then did <HI>Jehu</HI> venture to a&s;k <HI>Jehonadab</HI> &s;uch a dangerous Que&s;tion, as, <HI>Is thy Heart right, as my Heart with thy Heart?</HI> unle&s;s he believed, that notwith&s;tanding <HI>Jehonadab</HI>'s Declaration, he was &s;ure to remain as ignorant of <HI>Jehonadab</HI>'s Heart as before? And if Hypocrites are again&s;t all judging of others, what unhappy Signs or Planets reigned in <HI>Judea</HI> in the Days of Chri&s;t's Incarnation, that had &s;uch a &s;trong Influence upon the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, as to over-rule their natural Bent; &s;o that tho' Hypocri&s;y (of which they had a large Stock) fortified them again&s;t all judging of others; yet again&s;t Wind and Tide they judged Chri&s;t a Sinner, Deceiver, Traitor and Conjurer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and damned the People that had re&s;pect to Chri&s;t and his Doctrine, for a cur&s;ed Crew that <HI>knew not the Law, Joh.</HI> 7.49. Can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> think, that he him&s;elf is more for judging others, than the Phari&s;ees were? Nay, may we not defy the Pope to judge our Mini&s;ters more than the Phari&s;ees judged Chri&s;t? If there be any Hopes at all of Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s &s;eeing his Error, may not we hope, he may &s;oon e&s;py it here? For doth not Scripture and Experience tell us, that it is the native Temper of the Hypocrite, to pretend to know and judge others, as well as to neglect looking into his own Heart? <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.1,&mdash;5. Is not his judging and condemning others, as well as his vain Pretence to know their Hearts, <HI>Satan</HI>-like in <HI>Job</HI>'s Ca&s;e, one great Part of his Art to hide his own Deformity? For how can the Hypocrite be white, unle&s;s he fir&s;t ca&s;ts Dirt upon his Betters, to make them look black?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> V. Granting, That <HI>Thieves flee the Search</HI> by hone&s;t Men or indifferent Per&s;ons, <HI>becau&s;e of their &s;tolen Goods, and that the more they endeavour to hide, the more they expo&s;e their Shame;</HI> yet will not Thieves readily &s;ubmit to be &s;earch'd by their own Familiars and Companions, and be glad of the Opportunity; becau&s;e they know before-hand, that the Judgment will fall in their Favour, by their giving their Judges a Share of the Booty? And will not this be a likely Way to make a Companion pa&s;s for a legal Witne&s;s, when Trial comes? Let the Query then be
<PB N="10" REF="004792_0006_100DED9C2CA4DD10">
Whether &s;uch Candidates as are unwilling to be tried and judged by indifferent Per&s;ons cho&s;en by the Synod, but run into a favourite Pre&s;bytery, contrary to a late Agreement made in the Synod; or tho&s;e that are willing to &s;ubmit to Examination both by the Synod and Pre&s;bytery, look mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious in the Point?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> VI. Is not Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> after all the Noi&s;e made about a carnal and converted Mini&s;try, obliged to give up the high Pretence of the &s;piritual Man's Ability to di&s;cern the true Chri|&s;tian from the clo&s;e Hypocrite? When after a bold towring Que&s;tion, which at the Propo&s;ing of it, would &s;eem to promi&s;e no le&s;s than a compleat Victory, viz. <HI>Doth not the &s;piritual Man judge all Things?</HI> Well, but will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ay, that the &s;piritual Man can make a po&s;itive Judgment of the &s;ecret State of Pro|fe&s;&s;ors? No; he intends no &s;uch Thing; for doth not he an&s;wer his own Que&s;tion, (1) Negatively, by &s;aying, <HI>that he,</HI> i. e. the Spiritual Man, <HI>cannot know the State of &s;ubtle Hypocrites infallibly;</HI> (2) Po&s;itively, by propo&s;ing a very mode&s;t Que&s;tion, thus, <HI>May not he,</HI> that is, the &s;piritual Man, <HI>give a near Gue&s;s, who are the Sons of</HI> Sceva, <HI>by their Manner of Praying, Preach|ing and Living?</HI> If it were not for what fore-goes and follows, would not this be apt to tempt a Body to think, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> is as &s;ober in his Judgment about judging of others, as any of his Brethren? For might it not puzzle any Body to demon&s;trate the Difference between near Gue&s;s and probable Judgment? Nay, of the Two, is not the latter, in Propriety of Speech, more than the former? And if this were conceded, would not the Controver&s;y on this Head be at an End? But yet it may be &s;aid, that &s;eeing the Scope of the whole Sermon &s;eems to imply, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> would have Men believe, that they may know a converted from an unconverted Mini&s;ter; or el&s;e would not the main Part of the Fabrick fall? May it not therefore be objected, that we are to take Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s <HI>near Gue&s;s</HI> in its due Connexion with what foregoes and follows? And if it be thus, mu&s;t it not intend &s;omething more than a probable Judgment; or el&s;e doth not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> knock under?

And can it amount to any more, in an ordinary Way, than a Proba|bility at the mo&s;t, by a better Rule than his &s;eems to be as yet? What can be the Meaning of this <HI>near Gue&s;s,</HI> if not, that we may <HI>almo&s;t</HI> come to know the Matter; for what comes only near the Mark doth not hit it, be it ever &s;o near?

Now in making Choice of a Mini&s;ter, we own, that People &s;hould con&s;ult with God by Prayer for Direction, and with God's Mini&s;ters as their Watchmen under Chri&s;t, make u&s;e of their be&s;t Judgments in trying the Suitablene&s;s and Sufficiency of the Gifts, and Sound|ne&s;s of the Doctrine, and Blamele&s;sne&s;s of the Character and Life, and good Appearance of the Faithfulne&s;s of the Candidate; if in the&s;e he gives Satisfaction, ought not Men to judge him a gracious Man? If notwith&s;tanding a Man's good and comforta|ble Appearance in the Particulars afore&s;aid, Men proceed to make Gue&s;&s;es of Mini&s;ters gracious or carnal States, without, beyond, or contrary to the well-grounded and con&s;iderate Judg|ment, formed upon due Trial of his Gifts, Orthodoxy, and Regularity, as afore&s;aid; will any tell us how it will be practi|cable to follow Go&s;pel-Rules in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter?

Now in Ca&s;e there be any unconverted Members in the Congregation, will not the&s;e be uncapable of judging in this Matter, and of Con&s;equence mu&s;t not &s;uch be debarr'd of their Vote?

Be&s;ides, &s;eeing the Controver&s;y of the Day is, in a great Mea&s;ure, about the Extent of the Power of Communities, of making, forming or framing Rules for their own Society, and the Obligation of tho&s;e Rules when agreed upon, we &s;hall en|deavour to put the Matter in as fair a Light as we can, in order either to be re&s;olved or to re&s;olve others. We &s;uppo&s;e it will be granted by all Hands among Non-Conformi&s;ts, (1) That no Church Judicature, in making Rules, hath Power to make any thing nece&s;&s;ary by their Determination, which is not one Way or other nece&s;&s;ary, prior or antecedent, to &s;uch a Determination; and therefore we reject the Notion of the Power of impo&s;ing Things meerly indifferent, dubious or unlawful; but here the Query is, Whether or no Things may not become nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent, by Rea&s;on of &s;ome Emergencies happening, which are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in their own Nature, nor made &s;o by any po&s;itive Law of God in particular? Yea, may not Cir|cum&s;tances &s;o far alter the Nature of Things, in their own Na|ture indifferent, as to make the Ob&s;ervation or Non-ob&s;ervation of them nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Circum&s;tances for the pre&s;ent; yea, &s;o as to give Grounds to a Judicature, to determine the Ob&s;er|vation or Non-ob&s;ervation of them nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent, and as &s;uch, to impo&s;e them upon their Community during pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances? How el&s;e could the Apo&s;tles and Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> judge ab&s;taining from Things offered to Idols, Blood and Things &s;trangled, nece&s;&s;ary Things? Is it not evident, that it was not their Determination, but the concurrent Circum&s;tan|ces, that made ab&s;taining from the&s;e Things nece&s;&s;ary, they only judging them &s;o, becau&s;e Circum&s;tances rendered them &s;o? And did not they judge, that the Nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;ing from &s;uch an E|mergency gave &s;ufficient Grounds to impo&s;e &s;uch a Canon for the pre&s;ent? <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 28. (2) Let it be granted, that no Church Judicature can determine any thing to be Duty, but what comes under &s;ome general Command of God, one Way or other, &s;o that there is no Room to bring in any new Duties, Or|dinances or Orders; But yet the Query is, when the Duty is commanded plainly and expre&s;sly, but the Manner thereof is undetermined, &s;o that there may be two or more Manners di&s;|junctively under the Command, &s;o that the Duty may be per|formed this Way or that Way; whether or no &s;ome Emergencies or weighty concurrent Circum&s;tances may not require a Judica|ture, to determine one of tho&s;e different Manners preferable to

the other, during the pre&s;ent Exigency, and thereupon enjoin the Ob&s;ervation of it for the pre&s;ent, until a better Expedient can be found out? For, is it not plainly demon&s;trable, that what is be&s;t in it&s;elf is not always the be&s;t Expedient in all Circum|&s;tances; or el&s;e mu&s;t not Nece&s;&s;ity, that old evil and &s;turdy Coun&s;ellor, be forced, will he nill he, to conform unto the Law? And &s;uppo&s;ing there be two Manner of Ways of Performing a commanded Duty, if the one be either difficult, hazardous or impracticable, during the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, when the other is ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed to a good Purpo&s;e; if the one appears more &s;ubject to Abu&s;e than the other, or hath been abu&s;ed, when the other appears &s;afer and le&s;s &s;ubject to Abu&s;e; if the one appears more edifying than the other, or better adapted to &s;ecure the compleat and decent Performance of the Precept than the other, by Rea&s;on of &s;ome concurrent Circum&s;tances; is it any Infringment on Chri&s;tian Liberty, for any Society, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, to make it a temporary Rule for their own Com|munity, to ob&s;erve that Manner of the two, which appears mo&s;t apt to obtain the End, when both come under the Rule of God's Command; or to enjoin what is mo&s;t expedient according to their be&s;t Judgment, during the pre&s;ent State of Things? If any will &s;ay, that this is a&s;&s;uming too great a Power in this Matter, will any tell us, where was the Church, Sect or Party of Chri&s;ti|ans, that were of any Standing in the World, that have not, in their Turn, a&s;&s;umed as much Power as is here claimed? (3) Let it be granted, as to Rules made in Emergencies, that the Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t extend as far as the Determination: for if they become nece&s;&s;ary to one particular Church, and not to another, it will not oblige the other Church to come under the Impo&s;ition, unle&s;s they come under the Nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o: And &s;o may not a Rule be nece&s;&s;ary in one Time or Place, which is not &s;o in another? (4) Let it be granted, that when the Nece&s;&s;ity evidently cea&s;es, the Impo&s;ition in &s;uch Ca&s;es ought al&s;o to cea&s;e, and the Mem|bers of the Church may claim it as their Right, to be relaxed of the Burden, and may rea&s;&s;ume their former Liberty, which the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity did re&s;train: And &s;o, may it not be the Duty of Synods as much to repeal &s;uch Acts, when Circum&s;tan|ces alter, as it was their Duty once to make them? May not we hence al&s;o &s;ee, that altering circum&s;tantial Rules occa&s;ioned by Emergencies, when Circum&s;tances alter, is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on or Religion, that on the contrary,
<PB N="19" REF="004792_0010_100DEDA5190C1430">
Men's Attachment to ob&s;olete Canons, occa&s;ioned by particular Emergencies, in or under different Circum&s;tances, would be a Proof of the Lamene&s;s of the one, and the ready Way to make the other to u&s;e a Crutch, when it hath no need of it. (5) Let it be granted, that no Judicature is to feign Nece&s;&s;ities and ima|ginary Exigencies, as an Engine for ambitious Spirits, to try Conclu&s;ions upon Men's Con&s;ciences, or to practi&s;e upon Men's Tamene&s;s; and therefore the Nece&s;&s;ity ought to be &s;uch as carries its own Evidence along with it to the unprejudiced; and that therefore Men &s;hould be fair and above Board in pointing out the Nece&s;&s;ity, and not to depend upon a meer Determination in the Matter: For doth not Experience prove, that Sparingne&s;s in pointing out the Nece&s;&s;ity requiring &s;uch Determinations, for Fear of offending &s;ome, hath often wronged a good Cau&s;e; and hath been a Means to help &s;uch as were di&s;po&s;ed to quarrel, to carry their Re&s;entments higher, to the Offence of many? If any grant, that this Power of forming Rules in religious Com|munities, &s;hould be further limited than is here &s;pecified, will they tell us what Limitations they want more?

When therefore any Community, be it le&s;s or more Publick, after mature Deliberation, a&s;king Coun&s;el of God, and con&s;ulting with his Word and one another, do in a &s;olemn Manner agree, that &s;uch and &s;uch Rules are Scriptural in one or other of the Sen&s;es afore&s;aid, and therefore meet Expedients to prevent Sin, or to pre&s;erve Order, and therefore e&s;tabli&s;h them as afore&s;aid in their Community; how is it con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on or Religion, to &s;uffer &s;uch Rules to be counter-acted by particular Members, without calling them to an Account? If this be allowed in &s;uch weighty Matters, as the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, and the practical Di&s;&s;olving of the Relation between Mini&s;ter and People, after the &s;olemn Contracting of it with uplifted Hands, Fa&s;ting and Prayer, in Obedience to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution; why not in many more Ca&s;es of le&s;s Moment? And &s;o, if in particular Matters, Men are allowed to multiply Exceptions, as oft as their Humours move them, of what U&s;e or Service will the general Rule be at la&s;t, excepting only to make a fair Shew to deceive the Simple? For is it not evident, that no general Rule can be put in Execution but in particular Ca&s;es? If therefore it be nece&s;&s;ary to make Exceptions, in any particular Ca&s;e, again&s;t a general Rule e&s;tabli&s;hed in a Com|munity,
<PB N="20" REF="004792_0011_100DEDA7649BBC10">
ought not all regular Members of &s;uch a Community apprize their re&s;pective Community of &s;uch Matters, as &s;eem to require &s;uch Exceptions, that &s;o the Circum&s;tances of &s;uch Af|fairs may be ballanced and con&s;idered according to Merit, that &s;o common Con&s;ent may be obtained for making &s;uch Excep|tions, if none be expre&s;&s;ed in or under the general Rule already? How otherwi&s;e can Men expect to walk without giving their Brethren ju&s;t Offence? Is not that Power too great which the Pope challenges, when he a&s;&s;erts his Right and Authority to di&s;&s;olve Contracts, Relations, and Obligations, at his Plea&s;ure, under the Pretence of the greater Good of the Church? And doth not he de&s;erve the Title of <HI>Man of Sin</HI> upon this Account, very richly? And can any &s;uppo&s;e, it were po&s;&s;ible for him to impo&s;e the Belief of &s;uch a mon&s;trous Power, if it were not, that his Followers are fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with another fal&s;e Notion, which makes Way for this, <HI>viz.</HI> That he can forgive Sins? Other|wi&s;e would not the former be dari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g to Rea&s;on and Religion? And to give every Church Member &s;uch a Power as to his Re|lation to his own Mini&s;ter, how mon&s;trous doth it look in a Prote&s;tant Country?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> V. That there is a va&s;t Difference between the flouri&s;h|ing and declining State of the Church is ea&s;ily granted; for doth not Experience tell us, that in declining Times there are always &s;ome ingenious Fellows, who will ju&s;tify any thing that &s;eems to &s;erve a Turn? But then, tho' there is a Difference between Winter-frize and a Summer Suit, a Wedding Garment and a mourning Gown, and between the flouri&s;hing and declining State of the Church, will it thence follow, that Men's Obligations to ob&s;erve good Rules laxen or le&s;&s;en in declining Times from what they were in flouri&s;hing Times, as Mr. <HI>T.</HI> in&s;inuates here? Will not &s;uch leaden Rules, that will gently bend with the Times, be a means, wherever they prevail, to make a crooked World ten times more crooked than it is? For what makes the Difference between the flouri&s;hing and declining State of the Church, but the careful and con&s;cientious, and the carele&s;s and hypocritical Ob&s;er|vation of Go&s;pel Rules and Order? Is it not therefore &s;elf-evi|dent, that the due Ob&s;ervation of good Rules, is the only Way to prevent and cure Declinings, unle&s;s Men would decline away the very Form of Religion, and bring it to Sun-&s;et? In what Country was it found, that breaking thro' good Rules was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ns of Reformation, much le&s;s a Step in it? Be&s;ides, is not

our Standard of Doctrine and Di&s;cipline very good, and do not tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, that are accounted carnal Men, keep to it in both, as well, if not better than Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party do? And if there be any Declinings in Practice, is breaking indu&s;triou&s;ly thro' good Rules the Way to mend the Matter? Will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> name the Mini&s;ter of the other Side, who, in Pulpit or Pre&s;s, &s;o much countenanced breaking thro' Church Rules, as he doth here? And let him in a calm Hour con&s;ider, whether or no, &s;uch Mini&s;ters as are not content with walking di&s;orderly them|&s;elves only, but al&s;o in the mo&s;t publick Manner indu&s;triou&s;ly encourage others to break thro' good Rules, in order to make Factions and Parties, do not appear to be in as declining a State as any other whom&s;oever? Are not they poor Empiricks, that pre&s;cribe knocking Men on the Head, or cutting it off, to cure the Head-ach, albeit it may prove effectual?</P>
<P>Par. IV. Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> adds, <HI>May the Lord &s;courge out Hire|lings out of his Temple, and &s;upply you with a faithful Mini&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. As to the fir&s;t Petition, viz. That <HI>God may &s;courge out Hirelings out of his Temple,</HI> if we con&s;ider it &s;eparately, who more willing to &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> than we? But yet, when we con&s;ider what follows in the &s;ame Paragraph, viz. <HI>and &s;upply you with a faithful Mini&s;ter,</HI> and compare it with the Scope of the whole Performance, which is to condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation for Crowds of covetous Phari&s;ees, mu&s;t not the true Meaning thereof be, <HI>&s;courge out the Pre&s;bytery of</HI> Donnegal <HI>and their Candidates, that there may be Room for</HI> Brun&s;wick <HI>Men,</HI> who are the only faithful Men in their own E&s;teem, if Fame be not a cruel Lyar? And may not <HI>Donnegal</HI> Pre&s;bytery well reply in the Apo&s;tle's Words, <HI>They zealou&s;ly affect you, but not well; they would exclude US,</HI> as you have it in the Margin, <HI>that you may affect them?</HI> Gal. iv. 17.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. If Mr. <HI>T.</HI> judges not the Workman worthy of his Hire, why doth he take it? If the <HI>Hireling</HI> be he that takes mo&s;t, let the Query be, Who got mo&s;t at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> in Pro|portion to his Labours, &s;ince the Decea&s;e of the late Pa&s;tor? Whether he that carries the bigge&s;t Bag under a Cloak, or he that carries a little one openly, be the <HI>Hireling?</HI> Or whether he that takes Wages at Home, and yet &s;pends a great Part of his Time abroad, in order to increa&s;e his Wages, or he that tarries with his own Flock, as being content with a poorer Pittance by
<PB N="22" REF="004792_0012_100DEDA9E575FF10">
far, be mo&s;t worthy of the Name? Is it not notorious, that <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Men are as apt to remove for the Sake of richer Benefices as any other? Whether Hirelings would not take a very prepo&s;terous Method, by joining with Di&s;&s;enters, to gain their End, as Matters go in mo&s;t Places, albeit, Providence is to be admired in making their little much in the Enjoyment? Yet have not we Rea&s;on to be thankful for our very great Liberty, which many precious Saints were deprived of? <Q>But yet, may not he gape for Dignities and Honours, till he is Chap-fallen, who&s;e Con&s;cience &s;hall ca&s;t his Lot among Di&s;&s;enters? And when he angled all Day, may not be come Home with a Diverb, &s;aying, I have fi&s;hed fair and caught a Frog?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> III. But to trace the Matter a little further, What &s;ort of Creatures are the&s;e Hirelings? Have we not their Picture pretty well drawn in <HI>Mic.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and if any put not into their Mouth, they proclaim a War again&s;t them?</HI> May not a &s;mall Comment upon this Text, put the Matter in better Light, <HI>viz.</HI> Who is the Hireling, but he that cau&s;es the People to err, by encouraging them to break thro' good Rules, that bites with the Teeth of terrible Menaces and roaring Bulls? and if the&s;e tame any A&s;&s;es fit for riding, will it not be Time to cry Peace, by proclaiming all tamed Creatures, Converts? But what el&s;e can be done to &s;uch knotty Pieces, as will not open their Pur&s;es or Butteries by either of the&s;e Ways, but proclaim a War again&s;t them, by damning them for a cur&s;ed Crew of carnal hard-hearted Phari&s;ees, hypo|critical Varlets, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> And then it follows by the old Rule, that no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks; and by the new Rule, are not all carnal Men &s;uch? For who will dare &s;ay, that there is any Difference between a carnal Man and a corrupt Phari&s;ee? But after all, tho' the&s;e Hirelings &s;hould be &s;courged out of the Temple, unle&s;s the Church Doors be well guarded, and the Church Windows be well watched, that they do not re-enter by the one, nor climb up by the other; may it not be feared, that for every <HI>one</HI> that is driven out, <HI>&s;even</HI> will enter in at a Back-Door, as long as Catholick Anarchy prevails to keep an open Door to all Comers? And who knows but that the latter may be more hungry than the former; when 'tis well known, that <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s leaner Kine came up la&s;t? And was it not a little &s;trange, that the ill-favour'd Kine were of &s;uch an untoward,
<PB N="23" REF="004792_0012_100DEDA9E575FF10">
envious Nature, that neither the fat Cattle, nor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Grana|ries, could make them alter their &s;habby Ill-favour?</P>
<P>Having thus taken a View of the <HI>Epi&s;tle Dedicatory</HI> and the <HI>Directions</HI> given in the Sermon, we now proceed to con&s;ider the Main of the <HI>Sermon</HI> in order.</P>
<P>The Text was, MARK vi. 34. <HI>And JESUS, when he came out, &s;aw much People,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We entirely agree with Mr. <HI>Tennent, That a faithful Mini&s;try is a great Ornament, Ble&s;&s;ing and Comfort to the Church of God, &s;o on the contrary, that an ungodly Mini&s;try is a great Cur&s;e and Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>If we mi&s;take not, the Con&s;ideration of the Circum&s;tances of the Place, compared with the main Scope of the pre&s;ent Performance, affords us ju&s;t Grounds to propo&s;e one general Query, by Way of Introduction, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. Whether it be not an effectual Way to comfort People, when under Sorrow for the Lo&s;s of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them with the Notion, that what they lo&s;t, was not only worthle&s;s, but al&s;o their Cur&s;e, and that their Bereavement was a great Deliverance from a &s;ore Judgment, which put them in as fair a Way to obtain a great Ble&s;&s;ing, as <HI>Rebecca</HI> did <HI>Jacob;</HI> &s;o that if People under&s;tood their own Good, they ought not only to ble&s;s God for the happy Change, but al&s;o to awaken a much deeper Sorrow upon the Account of the Enjoyment of what they once wrongly counted their Mercy, but really was their Cur&s;e? And &s;o may not we learn hence the &s;peedie&s;t Way imaginable to comfort a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Widow, bemoaning the Lo&s;s of her kind and dear Hu&s;band; for what is it but telling her, that it was her blind Love and fanciful Fondne&s;s, that made her to think much of him, when in Reality he was the &s;orrie&s;t Tool alive, good for nothing but to &s;tand in the Way, and to hinder Room for a Better; or if he were not &s;o, tell her it is her true Intere&s;t to bury the Memory of all his Endowments in the Ditch, and at lea&s;t feign him to be &s;uch a one as is afore&s;aid now, whatever he was; for what is a dead Lyon worth? And &s;o divert Sorrow for the Lo&s;s, with a greater Sorrow for the Enjoy|ment, during her Days of Mourning; and this will ripen for a &s;econd Match in a Hurry, when yonder brisk, topping Fellow comes, who is worth ten of what &s;he lo&s;t. Or el&s;e let her try the Experiment; and will it not be probable, that &s;ome Body will gain his End, if the Widow be worth Money? Is this di&s;tinct Application? But to proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004792_0013_100DEDABB7C03F50">Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Doctrinal Propo&s;ition is, <HI>That the Ca&s;e of &s;uch is much to be pitied, who have no other but Phari&s;ee Shepherds or unconverted Teachers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. Whereas Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> gives it as a Mark of Phari&s;ee Teachers, <HI>That they are very indi&s;tinct in the Application of their Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> pag. 9.

And can any be more indi&s;tinct in his Application, than Mr. <HI>T.</HI> is here in his Doctrine? For is not there a va&s;t Difference betwen a corrupt, degenerate, blind, unnatural Phari&s;ee Teacher, full of Bigotry to human Inventions, and an orthodox, regular, letter-learned, &s;ober, judicious, know|ing and gifted Mini&s;ter, even tho' he were unconverted? But who can prove him unconverted while &s;uch? Is there no Dif|ference between tho&s;e who indu&s;triou&s;ly took away the Key of Knowledge, even Scripture, to make Way for their own Tra|ditions, and tho&s;e who indu&s;triou&s;ly make U&s;e of the right Key to in&s;truct them&s;elves and others? Is there no Difference between &s;uch abandoned Wretches, who for their &s;ore Abu&s;e of the Means of Light and Knowledge, were given up to Blindne&s;s of Mind, Hardne&s;s of Heart, Deafne&s;s of Ear; yea, to Pride, De|lu&s;ion and Vain-Glory, &s;o that they became thir&s;ty Per&s;ecutors, and virulent Oppo&s;ers of Chri&s;t and his true Followers; for were not the Phari&s;ees &s;uch? And a natural Man, orthodox in Principles, regular in Practice, endowed with a great Degree of common Gifts of God's Spirit, &s;uch as Knowledge, Convictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> capable of &s;peaking with the Tongues of Men and of An|gels, of under&s;tanding all My&s;teries, and having all Knowledge? Tho' it be true that a natural Man may arrive to this Pitch; yet, who but blind Ignaroes, &s;tuffed with Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, will pre|tend to judge &s;uch a one a natural Man, unle&s;s &s;ome different Fruit appears? Tho' we grant, that the Want of Grace may and doth hinder his own Soul's &s;aving Benefit; yet &s;urely, is not there a va&s;t Difference between the Mini&s;try of the one and that of the other, as to others, even as much as there is between Light and Darkne&s;s, Meat and Poi&s;on, Bread and a Stone, Fi&s;h and a Scorpion, Truth and Error, and between human Inventions and divine In&s;titutions?

We &s;hall therefore trace Mr. <HI>T.</HI> thro' the &s;everal Branches of the Phari&s;ee Teacher's Character, and when we have offered but a &s;mall Part of what we have to offer in the Matter, we &s;hall leave the Unprejudiced to judge, whether Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party, or his Oppo&s;ers, act mo&s;t conformable to the Character he a&s;&s;igns unto the Phari&s;ee. When it is Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s Turn to be Carver, can he take it ami&s;s, that we &s;erve his Brethren with the fir&s;t Cut of Phari&s;ee Characters? And if that will not &s;erve him and them, is not the &s;econd Cut large enough for Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party? For when he frankly be&s;tows the fir&s;t fair Set of Characters upon the Phari&s;ees, doth not he a&s;&s;ign over his Right to them under Hand, before a competent Number of Evidences; &s;o that if his Brethren can but &s;hew a better Claim to them than the Phari&s;ees, mu&s;t not the Trial or Judgment fall in their Favour? For how can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> claim Orthodoxy and Regularity in the pre&s;ent State of Things, when by his own Donation he hath made the&s;e the Phari&s;ee's Property, without turning Phari&s;ee? And will not this entitle him to the &s;econd Set of Phari&s;ee-Characters by his own Law? To bring the Matter then to a Deci&s;ion, let the Query be, whether Mr. <HI>T.</HI> who hath re&s;igned, or his Brethren who have not re&s;igned, have the be&s;t Title or Right in the fir&s;t fair Set of Phari&s;ee-Characters, <HI>viz.</HI> Orthodoxy, Letter-Learning and Regularity? If they have not re&s;igned, are not they in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? If Mr. <HI>T.</HI> hath re&s;igned, mu&s;t not he make a new Purcha&s;e, before he can come to have a legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? when therefore there is no Medium, mu&s;t not giving up a Right in the fir&s;t, be the procuring of a ju&s;t Right in the &s;econd Set of different or contrary Characters? which are as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t Branch of the Phari&s;ee Teacher's Character is <HI>Pride and Self-Conceit.</HI> We grant, that the Phari&s;ee de&s;erved the Character; for doth not the Scripture tell us, that they were a People that tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous and de&s;pi&s;ed others, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.9, &mdash; 14. But as for <HI>loving the upper|mo&s;t Seats in the Synagogues,</HI> we query, whether that was a Part
<PB N="29" REF="004792_0015_100DEDB24B103AC8">
of the Character of that proud Sect, and not the peculiar Character of the Phari&s;ee Teachers? For doth not Rea&s;on and Scripture both allow, that the Pulpit &s;hould be higher than the common Seats? For did not <HI>Ezra</HI> &s;tand upon a Pulpit of Wood, and was he not higher than the People? <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.4, 5. Or will Men condemn <HI>Ezra</HI> for a wicked Phari&s;ee, becau&s;e he was a Scribe? Would not that Man make him&s;elf ridiculous, who would call Mr. <HI>T.</HI> a proud Phari&s;ee, becau&s;e when preach|ing, he maketh U&s;e of a Pulpit within Doors, or a proper Stage or Balcony without, higher than the People, that his Auditors may hear the better? And doth not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> accept of the Title of <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> by way of civil Re&s;pect, and can he &s;ay, that others have done more, or conte&s;ted with any about it? Or would Mr. <HI>T.</HI> that others &s;hould reject it, that he may wear &s;uch Feathers &s;olely in his own Cap? Can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> with all his Skill in Rheto|rick tell the World, what is that material Difference, that is between him and the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in &s;uch Matters? Where then is the Edification of turning Scripture thus into an empty Sound, by quoting it to no Purpo&s;e, but to amu&s;e the Weak, by making People believe that the Point is proved, when it is only darkened and palliated with Sounds? Who are <HI>more ma&s;terly and po&s;itive in their A&s;&s;ertions</HI> than tho&s;e, who &s;trive to advance mere and fal&s;e Opinions into the Rank of Articles of Faith, &s;uch as, 1. That every one that is in a State of Grace, knows it. 2. That we mu&s;t know, that our Mini|&s;ters are truly gracious, before we can know that they are called of God to the Mini&s;try. 3. That a Mini&s;ter mu&s;t have A&s;&s;urance that he is converted, before he can know that he hath a divine Call to the Mini&s;try. 4. That a Mini&s;ter mu&s;t know that Chri&s;t is formed in the Hearts of his Hearers, before he can take Com|fort that he doeth Good. Will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, who&s;e Mark or In&s;cription have the&s;e? and how can the&s;e be proved? Who are tho&s;e that look upon others that differ from them with more <HI>Air of Di&s;dain,</HI> than tho&s;e who (like the old <HI>African</HI> Conven|ticle, much reviled and much imitated, who monopolized Sal|vation to tho&s;e that were of <HI>Donatus</HI>'s Part) condemn all that differ from them, and judge them <HI>accur&s;ed, carnal, hypocritical Varlets, Phari&s;ee Teachers, covetous Locu&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c.?

<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Branch of the Phari&s;ee-Teacher's Character, is <HI>Policy and Craft:</HI> We hope it will be allowed by all, that to be wi&s;e as Serpents, and innocent as Doves, is whole&s;ome Coun|&s;el; but yet is not Craft another Thing?

And for all, that &s;ome of them, as well as of other Ranks, are fiery Zealots and Make-bates, will not the Body of the Clergy of this Generation afford a very con&s;iderable Number, that may ju&s;tly be called merciful Men? We hope that all orthodox Chri&s;tians will own, that to a&s;&s;ert Truth, to confute Er|rors, to &s;top the Mouths of Gain&s;ayers, to reprove the Unruly, to comfort the Feeble-minded, to &s;upport the Weak, to com|mand the Ob&s;ervation of Chri&s;t's Commands, and even to <HI>take the little Foxes, that creep in thro' Holes to &s;poil the Vines,</HI> is a commendable Practice in Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters; But who are tho&s;e, that breath forth mo&s;t of the Cruelty of Wolves, by an im|prudent and an uncivil denouncing of Terrors, by damning and devilizing Men, giving the Devil more than his ju&s;t due? Who are tho&s;e that di&s;cover mo&s;t Malice, by a&s;per&s;ing their Brethren, dre&s;&s;ing them in Wolves Skins, by crying out <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees, carnal Hypocrites, Ahitophels</HI> and <HI>Locu&s;ts;</HI> drawing their pre&s;umptuous Cen&s;ures thro' the very Hearts of their Oppo|&s;ers, even when they are in the Right in oppo&s;ing them; tearing their Characters, marring their U&s;efulne&s;s, di&s;quieting their Peace, encouraging their People to leave them without any ju&s;t Rea&s;on for it, fomenting Factions, to the occa&s;ioning the Removal of &s;ome Mini&s;ters from their People, and the di&s;heart|ening of others? Was not it an In&s;tance of &s;ome Cruelty, that &s;ome were guilty of, if Fame be not a Lyar, who were indu&s;|trious to hinder the Reception of a Mini&s;ter in a &s;econd Place,

And whe|ther the feeling of a full Pur&s;e, be not a better Prize to the co|vetous, than the Sight of an empty Bag? Have the other Side entered into the&s;e Gentlemen's Labours, as they did into tho&s;e of others, in order to get more Money? Or have not the mo&s;t able Places got mo&s;t Vi&s;its from Itinerant Mini&s;ters, when the Places that were wholly de&s;titute of Preaching before, are neg|lected, except they lie in the Way to the Carca&s;s?

Is not the Authority great, when the Things in them&s;elves, prior to God's Commands, are but &s;mall? Is not this to be &s;een plainly in <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Sin? And as to <HI>Bigotry to human Inventions,</HI> if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> hath aught to charge his Brethren with on that Head, ought not he to de&s;cend to parti|culars, and &s;peak out, that they may be either foiled or cleared? In the mean Time, will he tell us, what but human Inventions or wor&s;e, are, 1. The general, di&s;orderly and &s;eemingly malici|ous Exclamations again&s;t Mini&s;ters in the Lump; 2. The Pre|tence of po&s;itive judging Men's carnel or gracious States, by or upon Men's Declarations of their Experiences, and erecting So|cieties for this Purpo&s;e, as one main End of them; 3. The vain Pretence of ordinary Mini&s;ters to an immediate Call to the Mi|ni&s;try; 4. The indu&s;trious hiding or concealing of Go&s;pel Pro|mi&s;es, or the Grace thereof, for a Time, from convinced Sin|ners, in order to rai&s;e their Terrors and Di&s;tractions higher by the Law; 5. Their &s;ending Mi&s;&s;ionaries into Vacancies in the Bounds of other Pre&s;byteries, without their Invitation, and a|gain&s;t their declared Judgment, without as much as hearing their Rea&s;ons, or &s;triving to &s;atisfy their con&s;cientious Scruples in the Matter; is not this Lording it over their Brethren with a Wit|ne&s;s? Is not &s;uch a Practice not only incon&s;i&s;tent with our Con|&s;titution, but al&s;o a Violation of the Rights and Order of all regular Societies in the general? Is not Go&s;pel Liberty a Right or Privilege to ob&s;erve, and not to de&s;troy Go&s;pel Order, much le&s;s can it be a Liberty to &s;et up Anarchy in its Room? Should not Di&s;&s;enters, who plead for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> let the World &s;ee and know, that they want not an univer&s;al Toleration of all Things; but a well bounded Toleration to di&s;charge their Du|ties to God and Man in their proper Places, Callings and Rela|tions, without di&s;turbing others in their proper Stations? 6. What but an human Invention, is a Non-re&s;ident, indefinite Mi|ni&s;try? For is it not ea&s;y to &s;hew, that it is &s;ubver&s;ive as of Go&s;pel Order, &s;o of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try? For either Men mu&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="004792_0019_100DEDBAB2E80350">
own, that a &s;tated Mini&s;try is God's Ordinance, or not: If they &s;ay not, doth not their own Practice contradict that? If they own it to be &s;o, are not Go&s;pel Ordinances not only in&s;titutive of them&s;elves, as requiring their own Ob&s;ervation; but al&s;o exclu&s;ive, not only of what is directly oppo&s;ite to them, but al&s;o of collateral In&s;titutions &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to them? For how can there be Room to &s;et up an itinerant Mini&s;try, where there is a &s;tated orthodox Mini&s;try already, without &s;etting up Thre&s;hold again&s;t Thre&s;hold, and Altar again&s;t Altar? And how can there be Room for that, unle&s;s there be &s;uch weighty Differences between both, as will afford at lea&s;t one Side ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Separation? And &s;uppo&s;ing there be ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Se|paration, mu&s;t not Men, before they regularly clear the Way for it, u&s;e Go&s;pel Methods, by treating with their Brethren in a Chri&s;tian Way and Manner, in order to try all proper Mea&s;ures of God's Appointment, to remove their con&s;cientious Differen|ces, whether by their own Re&s;olution or Conviction, or that of others? If Men divide abruptly without Cau&s;e, or if they have ju&s;t Cau&s;es of an orderly Separation, without trying orderly Me|thods to remove &s;uch Cau&s;es, if po&s;&s;ible, as afore&s;aid; How can they clear them&s;elves of being guilty of making Schi&s;ms?

Or rather doth not he in the Proof quit the <HI>Phari&s;ee Teacher</HI> with his leavened Doctrine, and draw his Arguments wholly from the Defects and Danger of the <HI>natural Man's Mini&s;try?</HI> We would be glad to know, what was the Rea&s;on, when the <HI>Phari&s;ee Teacher</HI> was tied fa&s;t to the Stake in the Query, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> in the Proof puts the <HI>natural Man</HI> to do Penance, and to bear all the Blame, the <HI>Phari&s;ee Teacher</HI> having no more but a By-blow at the mo&s;t?

<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t Argument then to prove, that &s;uch People, who have no better than the old Phari&s;ee Teachers, are to be pitied, is, 1. <HI>Becau&s;e natural Men have no Call of God to the mini&s;terial Work, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI> If this were true, how doth it prove the Point? For may not a natural Man's Mini&s;|try, if he be orthodox, va&s;tly differ from an heterodox Phari&s;ee's Mini&s;try? Yea, doth not a private Conference with a private Chri&s;tian, or even bare Reading of Scripture by private Chri&s;|tians, or even reading of good Sermon Books va&s;tly excel a Pha|ri&s;ee Teacher's Mini&s;try? And if a Mini&s;ter be gifted and &s;ound in the Faith, as well as regularly called, is not there a va&s;t Dif|ference between the Mini&s;try of one that preaches &s;ound Scrip|ture Doctrine, and one that preaches vain Traditions and cor|rupt Glo&s;&s;es!</P>
<P>But before we come to the Point, we may premi&s;e a few Things to prevent Mi&s;takes: We do then freely grant, 1. That Grace is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make a Man a true Chri&s;tian, and none doubts, but that a Mini&s;ter &s;hould be a true Chri&s;tian; nor do we &s;uppo&s;e, that any among us will &s;ay, that without true Grace any can fulfil his Mini&s;try acceptably, as to him&s;elf; and therefore it is very evident, that no Man can be looked upon, as fit to be called to the Mini&s;try, but &s;uch as are e&s;teemed gracious Men: So that it is not our Aim, in the lea&s;t, to plead for an unconverted Mini&s;try; for we are again&s;t having &s;uch as much as Mr. <HI>T.</HI> And if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> undertakes to prove any of our Mini&s;ters &s;uch, we promi&s;e upon good Proof made, to reject them forthwith; but the Query is, Who are to be e&s;teemed carnal Mini&s;ters, or how to know them? 2. We grant, that it is the unque&s;tionable Duty of every private Chri&s;tian, much more of a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, to examine him&s;elf about his State oft, and to labour diligently in the U&s;e of appointed Means, to attain all po&s;&s;ible Evidences of their gracious State. 3. That the Ordainers of Per&s;ons to the Mini&s;try, &s;hould make an ex|qui&s;ite Trial of the Gifts and Orthodoxne&s;s of Candidates to the

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. Doth not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> allow, that even <HI>the &s;piritual Man cannot infallibly know the States of &s;ubtle Hypocrites; but only make a near Gue&s;s of it at the be&s;t and furthe&s;t,</HI> as we have noted already?

And when tho&s;e that are authori&s;ed by God for this Purpo&s;e, do in the Simplicity of their Hearts act according to their be&s;t Light, in Chri&s;t's Name, and according to his In&s;titution, in calling any into the Mini&s;try, wherein Mini&s;ters act mini&s;terially, with the Concurrence of the People, inviting or calling in a Way of Go&s;|pel Privilege or Obedience to Chri&s;t; Is not every one that is thus called according to Go&s;pel Rule, at lea&s;t mediately called of God?

And therefore we would a&s;k Mr. <HI>T.</HI> again,</P>

Yea, may not this Aim be in &s;ome who never receive a Call, by Rea&s;on of &s;ome providen|tial Lets, tho' &s;uch a Call was really once de&s;igned both by them&s;elves and others?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. If the Call to the Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ts principally in &s;uch an Aim, as is afore&s;aid, will it not follow, that every Godly Man hath a Call to the Mini&s;try? For will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ay, that a
<PB N="45" REF="004792_0023_100DEDC45712F3B0">
Man may be Godly, without having &s;uch an Aim? And mu&s;t not every Godly Woman have &s;uch an Aim too, as well as the Godly Man? What Need then is there of u&s;ing the Ivory Chair in chu&s;ing Popes? For by this Rule, may not a &s;econd Pope <HI>Joan</HI> be admitted in her Hoop-Petticoat? For who can &s;ay, that her Sex is any Hindrance to her having a good Aim?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> III. If the divine Call to the Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ts princi|pally in &s;uch an Aim; is it not in the Power of a godly Per&s;on to call him&s;elf with a divine Call, at lea&s;t as to the principal Part of it, and would not this be a flat Contradiction? And when he hath the principal Part of a divine Call in him&s;elf, may not he make a Shift as to the re&s;t, e&s;pecially if others are a little backward, as not being clear in the Matter? For how can he &s;top at Man's Judgment, if others judge him unfit, who knows, that he hath the principal Part of the divine Call? Can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> expect, that any but meer Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, will join with him, in placing the principal Part of the divine Call in &s;uch an Aim?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> IV. Doth not a divine Call not only authorize, but al&s;o require and oblige the Per&s;on called, to &s;et about the Execution of his Office, as &s;oon as Providence opens a Door for it, without any further Inauguration? And will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ay, that &s;uch an Aim will warrant or ju&s;tify a Man in &s;o doing, tho' never &s;o &s;incere?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> V. If the principal Part of the Call to the Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecret Aim of the Per&s;on called, how &s;hall it be po&s;&s;ible for People in an ordinary Way, to be &s;atisfied about the Validity of the Call of their Mini&s;ter, &s;eeing it is well known, that the mo&s;t notorious Deceivers have made the mo&s;t vaunting Boa&s;ts of their good Aims, to hide their bad De&s;igns and anarchical Di&s;orders, for which this Notion opens a wide Door; for if this be admitted, may not every one that willeth, con&s;e|crate him&s;elf a Prie&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> VI. It is readily granted, that a natural Man, while &s;uch, cannot aim &s;ingly at God's Glory; but yet when the Call to the Mini&s;try doth neither in whole nor in part con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch an aim; why may not a natural Man have a regular Call to the Mini&s;try for all this? And this leads us to Mr. <HI>T.'s</HI> &s;econd Attempt, to confirm his beloved Tenet, viz. <HI>That a natural Man hath no Call of God to the Mini&s;try under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation;</HI> which Tenet is made the He-Goat of the Flock, or the main Battering-Ram to win or keep the Fort: But here

Now, are not all unconverted Men wicked Men?</HI></P>
<P>Here, before we proceed further, we &s;hall premi&s;e a few Words to clear the Way. We &s;hall remark then, 1. That we are &s;lided unawares from wicked Mini&s;ters to <HI>wicked Men</HI> in general, and from the mini&s;terial Office to <HI>&s;acred Things</HI> in general, and the unconverted Man is fairly excommunicated not only from the Mini&s;try and &s;pecial Ordinances, but from med|dling with whatever Things that can be called <HI>&s;acred;</HI> &s;o that if this Rule &s;tands, if the carnal Man makes or meddles in Things &s;acred, &s;uch as Prayer, Reading or Hearing God's Word, he mu&s;t venture at his own Peril, by kicking again&s;t the Pricks, or bidding open Defiance to a plain divine Prohibition; and if this be not &s;trange Divinity, what can be called &s;o? 2. Becau&s;e it is hard to venture at once to the Head of this horned Argu|ment, we &s;hall take it by the Tail, and grant, that all uncon|verted Men may be rightly called wicked Men; but before we will yield any more, we will try the Force of a few Queries on the Head.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. If the wicked, <HI>i. e.</HI> the unconverted Man, be forbid to meddle in &s;acred Things, will it not thence follow, 1. That Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion are no Sins in an unconverted Per&s;on; for if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Command makes Obedience his Duty, will not a Prohibition by the &s;ame Authority, relea&s;e as fa&s;t as the Command binds? And is not there this Advantage in the Ca&s;e, that the Prohibition binds always and at all Times? And

if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> could but prove this Doctrine true, would it not be worth its Weight in Gold for the &s;lothful Servant, when called to an Account for hiding his Ma&s;ter's Talent, or tarrying idle in the Market-Place, under a Go&s;pel-Call? For if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> here declares God's Coun&s;el, as he pretends to do, may not the &s;lothful Servant tell Chri&s;t boldly, that the Rea&s;on why he &s;at idle was, becau&s;e he forbad him to meddle in &s;acred Things by the Mouth and Pen of his faithful Servant Mr. <HI>G.

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. If the unconverted Man be forbid to meddle in &s;acred Things; will it not follow, that Duties, &s;uch as Prayer, Reading or Hearing God's Word, conferring about it, or medi|tating upon it, are in their own Nature, or as Duties, as truly Sins in a natural Man, as Stealing, Lying, Idolatry or Adultery are Sins in a &s;piritual Man? For will not a Divine Prohibition, if there be any &s;uch, make the forbidden Duty formally a Sin? And hath not &s;uch a Doctrine a native Tendency to confound the Difference between Sin and Duty, Good and Evil, and to demoli&s;h the very Form of Religion, under a Pretence of advan|cing the Power of it? What a &s;trange Divine Law would that be, that would forbid Men that are under it, the Performance of the Duties required by it?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> III. If the unconverted Man be forbid to meddle in &s;acred Things; will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, what &s;hall he do? For if the Divine Law forbids him to perform Duty, or to meddle therewith; doth not it al&s;o forbid him to commit Sin, or to meddle therewith? And can any find a Medium in this World between both, or in the next either? And all the While is not Man &s;uch a Creature, that cannot be wholly idle; and if God will not find him Work, can we think but the bu&s;y Devil will employ him fa&s;t enough? For is not the idle Per&s;on the Devil's Shop? It is well known, that an unconverted Per&s;on cannot exerci&s;e Grace, whereof he hath none, &s;o as to be bu&s;y in the Power of Religion; and if he be forbid to meddle in the Form, poor Soul! whither &s;hall he go? What mi&s;erable Preaching of Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel have we here, where we have neither Law nor Go&s;pel? What can be the Rea&s;on, that &s;uch a Man as Mr. <HI>T.</HI> thus halts at Noon-Day in a plain Ca&s;e? Mu&s;t not it be, either becau&s;e he did not con&s;ider the Point, or el&s;e hath not

he imbibed &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tick Notions unawares? Is not there room enough for God to blame and reprove the carnal Man for going on in Sin, and his wrong and defective Performances, to require better Duties from him, as well as to declare the Un|acceptablene&s;s of his pre&s;ent Duties; becau&s;e of his great Sins and Failures in the manner of the Performance of them, as well as becau&s;e of his Out-breakings otherways; without in the lea&s;t forbidding, but in all requiring him to meddle to a better Pur|po&s;e with &s;acred Things, and to render unto God the Tribute of Obedience due to him from his Creature?

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> XII. Whereas Mr. <HI>T.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, <HI>That the Devil may drive Men into the Mini&s;try,</HI> we would a&s;k Mr. <HI>T.</HI> who are in greater Danger of being driven into it by the Devil, than &s;uch who plead for an inward or an immediate Call in an ordinary Way, and place the principal Part of the ordinary Call to the Mini&s;try in the Aim of the Per&s;on called? Who but the Devil drives Men into anarchical di&s;orderly Ways, contrary to Go&s;pel Rule and Order, under the Pretence of an inward Call? Further we &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>T.</HI> will own, that the Devil drives none into the Mini&s;try without God's mo&s;t holy and wi&s;e Permi&s;&s;ion; is it any Way contradictory to God's mo&s;t holy Perfections, to &s;uffer others to be admitted into the Mini&s;try, by the Door of a regu|lar Call? Will God's Grace or Power be le&s;s glorious, if he works any &s;aving Effects by the Mini&s;try of &s;uch? May not &s;ome &s;uch be converted afterwards, and others be Ca&s;t-aways after preaching edifyingly to others, tho' they had a regular Call to the Mini&s;try, according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titutions? We own, that the Ordainers are under a Rule, and are to follow Chri&s;t's Pre&s;criptions, and ought not to commit the Mini&s;try to any, but &s;uch as have the good Appearance of faithful Men, and if any di&s;cover their Hypocri&s;y afterwards in the apparent Fruits of it, they ought to reject them; but yet will any infer from hence, that God is under &s;uch a Rule?</P>
<P>But to &s;et the Matter in a clearer Light, we &s;hall trace Mr. <HI>T.</HI> a little further: Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ays, pag. 8. <HI>But God &s;ends not &s;uch hypocritical Varlets,</HI> i. e. <HI>into the Mini&s;try.</HI> Mu&s;t not Mr. <HI>T.</HI>

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. Is not that Act, whereby God &s;ends Believers into the Mini&s;try, the Call of God? Will it not unavoidably follow, that tho&s;e Qualifications, &s;uch as Faith and a good Aim, are not the Call of God, but &s;omething different from it, and antecedent to it? Otherwi&s;e mu&s;t not a Man be called before he is called, which is ab&s;urd?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. If the Call to the Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e Qualifica|tions, will it not follow, that no Per&s;on ought to enter upon the Work until fir&s;t he be a&s;&s;ured of his own gracious State, and that he hath true Faith?

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> V. If the divine Call to the Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e Qualifications, will it not follow thence, that the weak tho' true believing Mini&s;ter hath not &s;o good, &s;o &s;trong or &s;ufficient a Call as the &s;trong Believer hath? Yea, may not the &s;ame Mini&s;ter's Call

For doth not he confound the authoritative Call, Com|mi&s;&s;ion or Command of God, which is the divine Act, either mediately or immediately, with the Qualifications requi&s;ite in the Per&s;ons called, to render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it for the Work they are called to, as if they were the &s;elf-&s;ame Thing?

Was not both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> equally called to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip? but yet were not they very differently qualified for the Work? Had not <HI>Na|thaniel</HI> the&s;e Qualifications before he received a Call?

What then is become of this towring Argument, which is the He-Goat of the Flock, in which Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;o much triumphs? Doth not it fall flat to the Ground upon a &s;mall Handling? For what is the whole of it but bare-faced Sophi&s;try, candied over with rhetorical Strains?

For is it not &s;aid that they were full of the Holy Gho&s;t before?

Foundation of the above Mi&s;take in Mr. <HI>T.?</HI> If it were not for this, would it not be altogether needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t upon a Thing &s;o plain and obvious to any unbya&s;&s;ed Per&s;on, tho' but of an ordinary Capacity? We grant that the above Di&s;tinction will hold, and is clearly warranted by Scripture, when it is ap|plied to the Go&s;pel Call to Chri&s;tianity; for Scripture tells us, that many are called by the Word, who are never called in|wardly by the Spirit: But is it not as evident, that God never appointed, and that Godly Men never u&s;ed, nor could in Faith u&s;e, the In&s;titution of a Call to the Mini&s;try, to convert Men, or to beget Faith in them? For in giving this Call, do not Mi|ni&s;ters and People call a Man to the Mini&s;try, not to make him a Chri&s;tian or faithful Man, but becau&s;e they charitably judge him a faithful Man already, by the Trial made of him? Is it not very evident, that the Call to the Mini&s;try is not given to convey Gifts or Graces to fit a Man for the Office, but to give a Man Authority and Opportunity to exert the Gifts and En|dowments, which he is judged to be endowed with, before a Call is given? El&s;e, what Need would there be of making an exqui&s;ite Trial of Mens Gifts and Fitne&s;s before-hand? We grant al&s;o, that there is a plain Di&s;tinction between an ordinary and an extraordinary Call to the Mini&s;try, the one being me|diate the other immediate, the latter was peculiar to extraordi|nary Officers, &s;uch as Prophets and Apo&s;tles; the former only is what ordinary Mini&s;ters can in Faith expect. Where then is the Scripture Foundation for the Di&s;tinction between the Call of God and the Call of Man, the inward and the outward Call to the Mini&s;try? We challenge Men to quote one &s;ingle Scrip|ture to &s;upport this feigned Di&s;tinction in the whole Book of God: For is it not evident, that the outward Call, of which Men or Man is the Mean, In&s;trument or immediate Agent&punc; when gone about according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution and Direction in his Word, is the Call of God; yea, the only ordinary Call which we may ju&s;tly name the Call of God? And is it not a reproaching of Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, to name it the Call of Man by Way of Di&s;paragement, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from what we name the Call of God? Is not making Di&s;tinctions where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is no Room for them, Phari&s;ee-like, who di&s;tingui&s;hed between &s;wearing by the Altar and the Gift upon the Altar, the Tem|ple and its Gold, as indi&s;tinct a Way of Preaching as omitting Di&s;tinctions, where the Nature of the Matter requires them&punc;
<PB N="57" REF="004792_0029_100DEDCEB5082048">
And is it not ob&s;ervable, by what we have &s;aid already, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> is chargeable with both in this Sermon? And &s;eeing he makes Indi&s;tinctne&s;s in the Application of Doctrines, one of the Characteri&s;tick Defects of the natural Man's Mini&s;try, will he tell us in his next a Sign of what is Indi&s;tinctne&s;s in a &s;piritual Man throughout his whole Sermon? We grant, that &s;ome do run uncalled or un&s;ent into the Mini&s;try, as the fal&s;e Prophets and fal&s;e Apo&s;tles of old, and tho&s;e even now, that upon a Pretence of an inward and immediate Call enter into the Vine|yard in a di&s;orderly Way, di&s;agreeable to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution; but yet can any that are outwardly regularly called, be &s;aid to go un&s;ent or uncalled? For is not the Call to the Mini&s;try an external Call, and is not the Effect of it an external vi&s;ible Re|lation in the vi&s;ible Church, as vi&s;ible between the Per&s;ons calling and the Per&s;on called; or a vi&s;ible Separation of a Man to an Office and Authority in the vi&s;ible Church? For is it not evident that Offices and Officers have a Relation only to the vi&s;ible Church, and not to the invi&s;ible? It is true, the Mini&s;ter may and ought to be an invi&s;ible Member of Chri&s;t's invi&s;ible Body; but will any &s;ay, that there is room for or need of Mini&s;ters to be invi&s;ible Pa&s;tors in the invi&s;ible Church as &s;uch? If then, there be an inward Call to the Mini&s;try, mu&s;t not there be &s;ome inward Effect of this inward Call, or el&s;e is it not in vain? To put the Matter in fairer Light if po&s;&s;ible; In the Call of the Go&s;pel to Chri&s;tianity, there is a double Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. An <HI>outward</HI> Effect, the Winning of Men to an outward Profe&s;&s;ion and Member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible Church and Duties therein. 2. An <HI>inward</HI> Effect, the Bringing of Men into a Member&s;hip in the invi&s;ible Church or Body of Chri&s;t, by or through a lively Faith; and therefore, is it not evident, that there is room for and need of an outward and an inward Call, the one by the Word, the other by the Spirit, in this Step? If any will &s;ay, that the Call to the Mini&s;try is a parallel Ca&s;e; will they be &s;o kind as to try their Skill in running the Parallel, and we will promi&s;e Attention. When Men are cho&s;en into any Church Offices, are not they cho&s;en out of the Church, which is or ought to be an A&s;&s;embly of Saints, in which none &s;hould be admitted, and in which none &s;hould be tolerated in full Commu|nion, but &s;uch as by their Profe&s;&s;ion and Conver&s;ation, bear a credible Appearance of their being Saints indeed? When there|fore Men chu&s;e a Mini&s;ter, &s;hould not they in all Rea&s;on chu&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="004792_0030_100DEDD050B33138">
an orderly Member, again&s;t whom there is no Charge of Accu&s;ation depending, and who appears upon an exqui&s;ite Trial and Enquiry, to be gifted, and &s;ound in the Faith, and regular in Practice? And yet when Men are but Men, &s;hort-&s;ighted Creatures, may not the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men upon Earth, after all po&s;&s;ible Pains, be foully mi&s;taken, as to Men's &s;ecret State of Grace, which none but God knows ab&s;olutely, and tho&s;e to whom he reveals it? Yet when in Obedience to Chri&s;t, and according to his In&s;titution, they act a con&s;cientious Part in calling any to the Mini&s;try; is not &s;uch a one rightly and legally called to the Mini&s;try; &s;o that there is no Deficiency in the Call, whatever may be in the Per&s;on called? And &s;o, who can deny but that <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu, Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phinehas, Judas</HI> and <HI>Demas,</HI> together with all the unconverted Men that ever entered into the Mini&s;try in a regular Way, according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, had a divine mini&s;terial Call, tho' they wanted Grace, which Mr. <HI>T.</HI> names the Call of God? But is it not wrong thus to mi&s;cal &s;acred Things? For is not changing of the true Names of &s;uch Things, the ready Way to lo&s;e their true Ideas, and thereby to bewilder our&s;elves and others, to the great Hazard of Truth?</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Argument, to prove, that <HI>&s;uch People who have no better than Phari&s;ee-Teachers, are to be pitied,</HI> is, <HI>becau&s;e the Mini&s;try of natural Men is uncomfortable to gracious Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. But what is this to the Matter in Hand? For may not the Mini&s;try of a &s;piritual Man be as uncomfortable to carnal Men, or even to &s;piritual Men under Decays and Slumbers; how el&s;e are Men made to cry and roar &s;o loud at Sea&s;ons? If Reports be true, have not &s;ome Hearers of late Sermons been made &s;o uncomfortable as to chu&s;e Strangling rather than Life? Have not many more been put into &s;uch Shocks and Fits, as made them Objects of Pity and Grief to mo&s;t of their Beholders; when it may be tho&s;e who had got the <HI>Second-&s;ight,</HI> could rejoice at &s;uch mournful Sights, in Token of their Tender-heartedne&s;s?

Every Bodies,</HI> but <HI>Somebodies;</HI> and after all is &s;aid, are not they <HI>Me&s;&s;rs. No-body</HI> knows them?

And if the other Side afterwards will not venture as &s;evere a Trial before indifferent Judges, will not the Way be in &s;ome mea&s;ure cleared, to treat them accordingly? Be&s;ides, Is not Truth much more comfortable than Error; and &s;o is not there a great Difference between Hearing an orthodox Mini&s;ter and an heterodox Phari&s;ee as to Comfort? And may not a carnal Man greatly excel many a godly Man, in all common Gifts of Memory, Judgment, Oratory, Eloquence, as well as the Heathen Orators did, and &s;o be able to deliver their Di&s;|cour&s;es with all the Advantage of Diction, Pathos, Empha&s;is, Cadence and Accent?

Be&s;ides, when Mini&s;ters are orthodox in Doctrine and regular in Practice (for if they be not &s;uch, we plead not for them) How can Men know that they are uncon|verted? When therefore the Word is preached in Purity by a Mini&s;ter that is regularly called, behaving orderly, and who hath not forfeited his Character by fal&s;e Doctrine or Mi&s;beha|viour; ought not his Auditors chearfully and thankfully to attend there-upon, looking to God for his Ble&s;&s;ing upon his own Ordinance, without needle&s;s and hurtful Jealou&s;ies, Doubts or Queries about the Mini&s;ter's &s;ecret State towards God?

It is true, God may over-rule Evil, &s;o as to bring Good out of it, but can that Good in any Sen&s;e be &s;aid to be the Effect of the Evil, or is it not the &s;ole Effect of &s;ome good Cau&s;e? Is there the &s;ame Ground to think, that God will make u&s;e of Satan, who hath no Right nor Call to u&s;e any one of God's Ordinances, as often as he doth a natural Man, well gifted and regularly called, according to God's In&s;titution, making U&s;e of his own Ordinance in Obedience to him, to convince, convert and edify Souls? Doth not God be&s;tow Gifts on natural Men, either for their own Good, or for the Good of others; or el&s;e, mu&s;t it not be, that he be&s;tows them in vain? Is there any Ground in all the Book of God for Men to think, that God will own Satan as an In&s;trument of conveying any &s;aving Bene|fit to the Souls of Men? If there is, had not Men better to wait upon him, than upon an enthu&s;ia&s;tick Dreamer's Mini&s;try; for doth not that Text in <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 32. plainly a&s;&s;ure us, that &s;uch <HI>&s;hall not profit God's</HI> I&s;rael <HI>at all,</HI> be their <HI>Dreams</HI> never &s;o plea&s;ing to Fle&s;h and Blood? We grant, that God may make U&s;e of Satan, to cha&s;tize and afflict the Bodies and Minds of Per&s;ons, for doth not Scripture and later Experience prove this? But who can prove, that God hath made u&s;e of him to &s;ubdue any Sin? It is granted, that the Body may be mortified by Satan; but is it not the proper Work of God's Spirit to mortify the Deeds of the Body? Is it therefore &s;uppo&s;able, that God will make Satan in&s;trumental of conveying any &s;aving Good to Souls by his wicked Temptations, in all which he rebels again&s;t God and &s;eeks the Ruin of Souls? If Men will once &s;wallow this wicked Sugge&s;tion, may not they as well believe, that wicked Men, who are Satan's In&s;truments, may, by their Temp|tations, convince Per&s;ons too, and con&s;equently that they may do at lea&s;t as much Good to Souls by &s;erving the Devil as ever they can do by &s;erving God, &s;eeing there is no more than a <HI>Chance-Medley</HI> in both? Is it not one of the mo&s;t unju&s;t and wicked Cen&s;ures of the Age, to rank all natural Men with Phari&s;ees, in order to condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation for natural Men and Phari&s;ees; and, as if this was too little, to rank them with Devils, in order to rai&s;e Prejudices again&s;t them, to the marring of the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel and the Good of Souls, by their Mini&s;try, as far as &s;uch wicked In&s;inuations can prevail?

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> VII.

If &s;o, can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> give us any Rea&s;on, why a gifted natural Man's preach|ing the Word, convincingly and clearly, &s;hould be le&s;s efficacious to convince and convert others, than a natural Man's own reading the Word, when the latter may be more ignorant than the former? Or will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, that Conviction or Conver|&s;ion by reading the Scriptures is an Effect of <HI>Chance-Medley</HI> too, in order to per&s;uade People to ca&s;t away their Bibles, or the read|ing of them, with or after their old Pa&s;tors, that they may &s;eek the Law wholly at the Mouth of the Prie&s;ts, for the Prie&s;ts Lips &s;hould keep Knowledge? But by Experience, by the Help of their Bibles, may not People know that they may utter Dreams? Well, is not it &s;ome Comfort to the old Mini&s;ters, that they are not contemned, but where the Truth and Ordi|nances of God are &s;lighted, and juvenile Inventions, having hoary Periwigs clapt on their Heads to make them look Grave, are admired?

Where
<PB N="81" REF="004792_0041_100DEDE839E486B0">
then is there Room for this extraordinary Nece&s;&s;ity to take Place? Is not this a fal&s;e and an empty Sound as well as the former?</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> III. As for the <HI>Abu&s;e made of the In&s;tance of</HI> Judas's <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> let tho&s;e that are guilty look to that, we are only for getting what Light and In&s;truction that Part of Scripture affords us; for is not that wrote for our In&s;truction, as well as the re&s;t of our Bibles?

And is it not the Duty of all Chri&s;tians, earne&s;tly to pray, that God may in Mercy pre&s;erve Men from &s;uch a Degree of De&s;pair, and all the native Cau&s;es of it, as may drive Men into Halters unde&s;er|vedly, as well as from &s;uch Practices as may ju&s;tly de&s;erve them?

<P N="1">1. <HI>By mourning for and &s;ympathizing with them, with compa&s;|&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s &s;econd An&s;wer, is, <HI>That this Pity is to be &s;hewn, by praying for them with Earne&s;tne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. When <HI>like People, like Prie&s;t,</HI> is an old Scripture Phra&s;e, how comes it to pa&s;s, that in this Age, the Crowds of the People in mo&s;t Places are exceeding Godly, but the Body of the Clergy exceeding carnal? When there is &s;uch Talk of tender Pity and earne&s;t Prayer for the godly People, as being in a poor melancholy State, is it not a little &s;trange, that there is not a Word of Pity, nor of Prayer, for the unconverted Mini&s;|ters, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a much poorer State, neither in this In&s;truction, nor in the whole Sermon?

Mini&s;ters as fit to be prayed for, as an heterodox di&s;orderly Iti|nerant?

If Mr. <HI>T.</HI> rightly applies that Text in <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 32. to the proper Per|&s;ons, when it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, that tho&s;e there intended &s;hould not at all profit God's <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> how can &s;uch a Prayer for <HI>&s;anc|tifying and &s;weetning their dry Mor&s;els</HI> be made in Faith? Doth not Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s pre&s;&s;ing Men to pray as afore&s;aid, imply, that he hath &s;ome Hopes, that &s;uch Prayers of the Godly may conduce to render &s;uch Preaching &s;ucce&s;sful; and is not this more Ap|pearance of Charity, than &s;eems to be reconcileable to his Ex|pre&s;&s;ions el&s;ewhere? For if there be any Grounds at all for the Soul to re&s;t in Hope, in the U&s;e of &s;uch Prayers, mu&s;t not there be &s;ome greater Probability of obtaining the Ble&s;&s;ing prayed for, than a meer <HI>Chance-Medley?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In <HI>pag.</HI> 16.

<P>The Motion, for aught we know, is very good, and if Congregations in general would contribute a little that way, may it not be of &s;ome Con&s;equence, for an after Supply? Only we would de&s;ire to know, how &s;uch a De&s;ign can be carried on better for the common Intere&s;t, than by putting &s;uch a School under the Care and In&s;pection of the Synod? But yet, tho' we would not be &s;o far mi&s;interpreted, as if we &s;poke any thing again&s;t encouraging &s;uch Schools, for we believe it a very good Motion; yet is it not ob&s;ervable, that when Mr. <HI>T.</HI> makes &s;uch Out-cries again&s;t Hirelings, yet he him&s;elf expects &s;ome Fruit from Go&s;pel-Hearers, <HI>more than cheap Prayers,</HI> when it would &s;eem, that he judges it too great a Favour for &s;uch Mini&s;ters, who&s;e hard Lot it is to be accounted unconverted upon Gue&s;&s;es, to have a Share of <HI>People's cheap Prayers;</HI> albeit it is well known, that the Mini&s;ters thus abu&s;ed, at lea&s;t many of them, have had their great Share in planting and watering tho&s;e very Congregations, in which up&s;tart Innovators now &s;o much crow over them? We would further a&s;k, Whether the unpecedented

Strictne&s;s in the Admi&s;&s;ion of Scholars; which Mr. <HI>T.</HI> pre&s;cribes here, <HI>viz.</HI> That none &s;hould be admitted into &s;uch Schools, <HI>but &s;uch as have plain Evidences of experimental Religion,</HI> be approve|able or unrea&s;onable? Would it not be &s;oon enough to require this of a Candidate, when he enters upon Trials? Or might not Godly Tutors be probable In&s;truments of Conver&s;ion in the Youth under their Care? And doth not Experience tell us, that Youth under Tutorage have &s;trangely altered, &s;ome for the Better, and &s;ome for the Wor&s;e?

And if Mr. <HI>T.</HI> intends the Mini&s;ters of our Synod in another In&s;inuation, <HI>viz.</HI> his &s;aying, <HI>if they could help it, they would not let one faithful Man come into the Mini&s;try;</HI> and when it is notorious, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> never had any Debates with any others but the Synod about Admi&s;&s;ions of Men into the Mini&s;try; and when there is a Debate on this Head depending between him and the Synod; how can any under&s;tand them of any other?

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> II. Will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, Whether the Caution Chri&s;t gave, <HI>not to call our Brother a Fool,</HI> was given to the Laity, or Clergy, or to both?

For if it be true, that God's Law forbids the natural Man to meddle in &s;acred Things, may not there be &s;ome Law, that gives the &s;piritual Man Liberty to u&s;e his Tongue as if it was his own? Or el&s;e why is there &s;o much of this done by &s;ome? Or is there &s;ome My&s;tery in the declining State of the Church that warrants this?

And is it not a greater Privilege and Liberty for a People to have a pious Mini&s;ter of their own Choice to attend upon, than to be vagabond Stragglers from Place to Place as <HI>Sheep without a Shepherd?</HI> And when Men have an orderly Mini&s;ter, where is the Carnality of obliging them to di&s;charge their Duties to God and to their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mini&s;ter, any more than that of binding Men to perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of other Relations? What if Men plead tender Con&s;ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es for the Community of Goods and Wives as well as of Mini&s;ters, or for de&s;erting their own Wives, as well as Flock or Pa&s;tors, to cloak Sin and Di&s;order? And are not the Duties of Mini&s;ters and People as plainly required as the other? What is that un&s;criptural Doctrine or Practice that is impo&s;ed? Who can &s;et Men at Liberty from relative Go&s;pel Duties? Is there no Difference between Chri&s;tian Liberty and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, Anar|chy and Di&s;order? Is not the one a Liberty to preach and profe&s;s Truth, to ob&s;erve Order, and to perform the Duties of their Place and Relations peaceably? What do con&s;cientious Non-Conformi&s;ts want more than this? Mu&s;t Men have Liberty be&s;ides this to &s;pread Errors, to confound Order, to di&s;turb others in the orderly Exerci&s;es of Piety, by rambling up and down to rai&s;e Factions, Feuds and Contentions, and to carnalize, devilize, phari&s;ize, and abu&s;e Men, with the Nick-names of <HI>Dupes and Dunces,</HI> meerly becau&s;e they do not run with them into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot, as they do?</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Maxim is, That the Determinations of Mini&s;ters and Se&s;&s;ions touching the Liberty or Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of particular Members, is to be founded upon and over-ruled by the Judgment and Inclination of &s;uch Members; &s;o that all the Authority that Church Rulers in &s;uch Matters &s;eemingly are allowed to exer|ci&s;e, is no other or more, but only to enquire what are the Judgments and Inclinations of particular Members, with re&s;pect to adhering to or leaving their own Pa&s;tor, and then to give
<PB N="103" REF="004792_0052_100DEE229E0A75D0">
them Liberty to act herein as they &s;ee fit; for how without this, can there be room to plead <HI>Men's Judgment and Inclinations as ju&s;t Rea&s;ons</HI> to ju&s;tify their for&s;aking their own A&s;&s;emblies, where God's Word is purely and therefore powerfully preached, and his Ordinances admini&s;tred in Purity? Have not the be&s;t Men in this imperfect State oft &s;uch corrupt Inclinations as will as naturally lead them to Sin and Di&s;order, as <HI>the Eagles fly to the &s;tinking Carca&s;s,</HI> if Men give Way to them? What if the Judgment or Inclination of the Member appears to the Mini&s;ter and Se&s;&s;ion incon&s;i&s;tent to Go&s;pel Rule and Order, mu&s;t they thereupon give Way to Men's Neglect of Duty and committing Sins, without bearing Witne&s;s again&s;t them for both?</P>
<P N="4">4. Another Maxim is, That every Member, after &s;olemn devoting or giving up of him&s;elf to God, his Church, and it's Rulers, to walk in Church Fellow&s;hip with them, and to be ruled by them according to God's Word, is &s;till Judge in his own Ca&s;e, how long and how often he will attend upon or ab&s;ent from the publick Admini&s;trations of his cho&s;en &s;tated Pa&s;tor, without being accountable to his Pa&s;tor or Fellow-members for his Neglect herein: For if the Member pleads <HI>Inclination or Opinion of being better edified el&s;ewhere,</HI> is not he at Liberty according to Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s Rule? Who then is Judge in the Ca&s;e? What then is become of the Right of Societies in their Mem|bers? May not Wantonne&s;s, vain Curio&s;ity, Love of Novelties, Di&s;gu&s;t, Want of Love to Truth and Go&s;pel Order, vain Admiration of glaring Errors and Di&s;orders, when nick-named Reformation, or even the Having of Per&s;ons in Admiration, incline Men to de&s;ert their own orderly Pa&s;tor, as well as better Principles? How then is it po&s;&s;ible for Go&s;pel Rule to take Place, where &s;uch vain Notions prevail?</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Maxim is, That &s;ecret Rea&s;ons or Surmi&s;es in a Man's own Brea&s;t, of which he can make no apparent Proof, are &s;ufficient Grounds to di&s;&s;olve the Relation between Pa&s;tor and Flock, at lea&s;t to ju&s;tify Men's Non-Attendance upon the Admini&s;trations of their proper Pa&s;tors: For according to <HI>Mr. T.</HI>'s Rule, if a Member is uncharitable enough to condemn his own Pa&s;tor for <HI>a carnal Man,</HI> tho' he is orthodox and regular; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pretends <HI>he is not edified by him,</HI> tho' his Doctrine is &s;ound, and his Life exemplary, or is prejudiced again&s;t him, &s;o that tho' he once con&s;cientiou&s;ly judged him <HI>a gifted Man,</HI> who appears to be &s;o &s;till to more judicious Per&s;ons, yet if upon a

&s;lender Trial he thinks another <HI>more gifted than him,</HI> or if he hath fallen out with him, tho' that may be upon the Account of his Faithfulne&s;s, &s;o that he <HI>is not inclined</HI> to hear him, is not he at Liberty, at lea&s;t if he hath the Art of Di&s;&s;embling &s;o far as to give his Mini&s;ter a <HI>Judas Ki&s;s</HI> at parting, may not he bid him Good-Night at Noon-Day? Is it not a brave Thing that Church-Members, at lea&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied ones, have &s;uch an Advan|tage over their re&s;pective Pa&s;tors, &s;o that if they want to de&s;ert them upon any Difference what&s;oever, is it not the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World to make a plau&s;ible Pretence of one of the&s;e &s;urmi&s;ed Excu&s;es? and then will he not be capped to all Intents and Purpo&s;es? For then hath not he got him upon the Hugg, yea, the <HI>Corni&s;h Hugg,</HI> and down he goes? For if he is a gifted Man, what Difficulty is it for ill Humour, to call him a <HI>carnal Man,</HI> a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> and to fill the Bu&s;hel, an <HI>Ahitophel</HI> too? If he be a gracious mild Man, is it not ea&s;y to call him a <HI>well-meaning ignorant Ru&s;tick?</HI> But if he be both a gifted and gracious Man, what Difficulty is it to tell him that he <HI>preaches too profound Divi|nity,</HI> and that <HI>Men are better edified el&s;ewhere?</HI> If he happens to demand an Account of the Per&s;on's Edification, <HI>viz.</HI> what new Le&s;&s;ons he hath learned, or Progre&s;s he hath made in practical Godline&s;s more than before? may not he tell him, that <HI>this is begging the Que&s;tion, he feels it, he believes it, he knows it, he a&s;&s;erts, and he will &s;tand to it, and that Thou&s;ands think &s;o as well as him&s;elf?</HI> and may not he add to all this, that <HI>it is as plain as the Sun, and that he is blind that doth not &s;ee it, yea, as blind as a Mole, as dead as a Stone, a Dupe, a Dunce, without any &s;pi|ritual Ta&s;te or Reli&s;h?</HI> And if the Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter be &s;o ob&s;tinate as to call all this no more than bold Say-&s;oes; is not there a Remedy for that al&s;o? for may not the Church-Member tell his Pa&s;tor, that <HI>it is his Inclination to leave him, and to go el&s;e|where?</HI> And &s;o may not we have U&s;e for an old ru&s;ty Rhime?
<Q><L>I do not love thee Dr. <HI>Fell,</HI> the Rea&s;on why I cannot tell;</L>
<L>But this is all that I can tell, I do not love thee Dr. <HI>Fell.</HI></L></Q>
Is not this &s;ub&s;tantial Divinity? And when a Per&s;on rhymes it &s;o plea&s;antly too, hath not he a Bu&s;hel full of the <HI>Spirit of Meekne&s;s?</HI> And if the Mini&s;ter be not carnal with a Witne&s;s, can he offer to &s;ay one Word more? But if he does, will it not give the Member double Advantage over him, to call him a carnal unconverted Phari&s;ee, an Oppre&s;&s;or of tender Con&s;ci|ences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if he &s;ays but little, but grieves at the hearing

of &s;uch &s;orry Rea&s;ons, &s;poken with &s;uch Confidence, if all that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ays be true, will not this be <HI>a Sign of his Rottenne&s;s and Hypocri&s;y?</HI> Are not the&s;e great Proficients!

<P N="6">6. In order to fortify Men's Plea of their getting more Edi|fication over the Pari&s;h Line, than within it, we think we &s;ee another Maxim half forged out, but either for Want of &s;odder|ing or a welding-Heat, or becau&s;e of the &s;tubborn Temper of the Metal, it &s;eems &s;o full of Flaws, that it wants the &s;econd Heat or Purification, before it be fit to be handled but very gingerly, which is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Benefit of Hearers or the Succe&s;s of a Mini&s;ter's Performances, depends &s;ometimes upon the Mini&s;ter's <HI>&s;uperiour Gifts,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>Grace</HI> carries the Day, &s;ometimes <HI>the Judgment or Inclination of the People</HI> will do Wonders, whatever the Mini&s;ter be, for aught appears; but low to reconcile the&s;e jarring Elements with them&s;elves or Scripture, which teaches, that the Efficacy of divine Ordinances depends upon God's Ble&s;&s;ing and Co-operation, mu&s;t be left to further Enquiry.</P>
<P N="7">7. That private Members may know when their Mini&s;ters are Gracele&s;s, albeit they cannot prove any Charges again&s;t their Doctrine or Deportment; for if they can do the latter, why are Men &s;o much in Love with gracele&s;s Men, when they exclaim &s;o loudly again&s;t them, as not to pro&s;ecute them? Can it be for Want of Good-Will? Or if they are willing, how are Men &s;o un&s;kilful as to pitch upon <HI>&s;ecret Surmi&s;es,</HI> which they cannot prove true, when at the &s;ame Time it is in their Power to produce apparent Proofs, which would de&s;erve Hearing? For does not the u&s;ing of the former Shifts, prove the Dearth of the latter?</P>
<P N="8">8. Another Maxim is, That a di&s;&s;atisfied Member, that hath taken &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t at, or is at Variance with his Mini&s;ter, right or wrong, is in a Capacity to make a truer Judgment of the Gifts and Graces of his Mini&s;ter, as well as of his own
<PB N="106" REF="004792_0054_100DEEA152F64750">
Edification by his Mini&s;try, than he him&s;elf could make when he re&s;pected him, or than the whole Congregation and Pre&s;by|tery could make at his Ordination, at lea&s;t, than what his pre|&s;ent Well-wi&s;hers do make of the&s;e Matters. How el&s;e can &s;uch <HI>&s;ecret Surmi&s;es</HI> be pleaded to be <HI>ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Separation</HI> from him?</P>
<P N="9">9.

How el&s;e can this be pleaded to be a <HI>&s;ufficient Ground</HI> to de&s;ert the Admini&s;trations of one's proper Pa&s;tor, for all in general that make it? For is it not ea&s;y to prove by apparent Fruits, that many pretend to much Benefit, who are &s;en&s;ibly hurt, in the Judgment of others more judicious in &s;uch Matters? And is it not well known, that the Account that &s;ome of them give of the Matter is very lame?</P>
<P N="10">10. Another Maxim is, That de&s;erting, cen&s;uring and abu|&s;ing their own orderly Pa&s;tors, and falling in with their Side, according to Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s Rule, is a &s;ure Sign <HI>of Grace and Conver|&s;ion;</HI> but adhering to their own Mini&s;ters, is a true Sign of <HI>carnal Men.</HI> How el&s;e are the unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied, through|out this Sermon, proclaimed <HI>pious, godly Souls,</HI> and the Adherents to their own Pa&s;tors are nick-named <HI>Dupes and Dunces, &amp;c. with|out any &s;piritual Ta&s;te or Reli&s;h?</HI> We grant, that &s;uch private Members as make groundle&s;s Exclamations again&s;t their own Mini&s;ters, upon <HI>meer Surmi&s;es,</HI> are fit Followers to &s;uch Preachers as do the like; but yet, we would a&s;k, whether tho&s;e that admire glaring Errors and Di&s;orders or tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them, are the <HI>greate&s;t Dupes and Dunces,</HI> or give the be&s;t Proofs of their Grace?</P>
<P N="11">11. There &s;eems to be another Maxim de&s;igned out of all, which, if it could be proved, would be worth all the Re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> To make People believe, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party are the <HI>only &s;piritual Men and gracious Mini&s;ters,</HI> and all his Oppo&s;ers <HI>Hy|pocrites;</HI> the <HI>only wi&s;e Men,</HI> and others but <HI>ignorant Ru&s;ticks;</HI> at lea&s;t the <HI>only edifying Preachers,</HI> and all the re&s;t being but <HI>lame Men,</HI> and unfit for the Work; for if they have <HI>Grace,</HI> they want <HI>Gifts,</HI> or if they have <HI>Gifts,</HI> they want <HI>Grace,</HI> or if they have a little <HI>of both,</HI> they preach again&s;t the <HI>Errors and Di&s;orders of the Times,</HI> and therefore their Sermon are unedifying

to &s;uch as are projecting how to build a <HI>Babel.</HI> Now, as this la&s;t &s;eems to be the De&s;ign of the whole Performance, may it not be worth our while to con&s;ider, what are the Proofs offered to &s;upport it? This will appear then,</P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ider the profe&s;&s;ed Scope of the whole Sermon, <HI>viz.</HI> To exclaim again&s;t carnal, unconverted Mini&s;ters, judging them &s;everely, and, according to Mr. <HI>T.</HI> Rule, <HI>Hypocrites are again&s;t all judging of others, in order to hide their own Filthine&s;s;</HI> and therefore to be &s;ure publick Exclaimers again&s;t Hypocrites are all hone&s;t Men, for is not this built on another &s;ure Maxim, <HI>viz.</HI> A Whore was never heard to call her Companion a Whore in the wide World, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould retort and call her a filthy Strumpet?</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Proof is, The Crowds follow them, and doth not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> give us Scripture Proof for this, <HI>where-ever the Carca&s;e is, there Eagles will be gathered,</HI> and may not we add another as much to the Purpo&s;e every whit, <HI>Rev.</HI> xiii. 3. <HI>and all the World wondered after the Bea&s;t?</HI> But before we can apply Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s Text to the Matter in Hand, mu&s;t not we have &s;ome Rule, &s;uch as, <HI>As the Wheel-barrow rumbles over the Pebbles, &s;o a Thumb-Rope of Sand will make an excellent Cable for the Fi&s;hers Folly:</HI> If it were not a di&s;tinct Application here might be thought too homely, Is it not ea&s;y for a carnal Man to be di&s;tinct? We &s;hall then only a&s;k, who are the Eagles; what is the pre&s;ent Carca&s;e; and what draws the Eagles to the Carca&s;s? If Mr. <HI>T.</HI> will be accounted a &s;piritual Man, accor|ding to his own Rule, mu&s;t not he be di&s;tinct in applying his own Compari&s;ons? Who was he that a&s;&s;igned <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> for a Mark of the true Church? But if ever we &s;aw the Picture of the Hor&s;e in the Mill, may not we &s;ee it here? The Mini&s;ters are good Men, becau&s;e the Crowds follow them; and the Crowds that follow them are Converts, becau&s;e they are graci|ous Mini&s;ters, and the Multitude's Attachment to them proves it?</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Proof is, Becau&s;e others do not put Men into &s;uch deep Convictions and under &s;uch deep Horror, as makes them cry, roar, faint and roll on the Ground, or &s;o as to run into Halters; or as to ca&s;t them into Fits and Convul&s;ions, as &s;ome do. What would a carnal Man be judged worthy of &s;ome Months ago, if he &s;hould &s;ay as much as Mr. <HI>W.</HI> does of the&s;e bodily Convul&s;ions, viz. <HI>That he believes they come from

the Devil,</HI> Journal, vol. 3. p. 63? We own that we do not find, that the&s;e were plenty among Prote&s;tants, by any Account we can get, but in the fir&s;t breaking out of <HI>Quakeri&s;m;</HI> but if &s;ome Travellers are to be credited, are not they much more plenty in the Popi&s;h Dominions? For, when the Prie&s;ts kindle the Flames of <HI>Purgatory</HI> into a terrible Bonfire, when the Pope's Bulls make an hideous roaring, when the Noi&s;e of the Wheels of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition Coach</HI> rattle, how can the poor People, that are kept in &s;uch profound Ignorance, poi&s;oned with Super&s;tition, and broken-hearted with &s;lavi&s;h Fear, bear &s;uch Thunder-Claps, without being put into a Con&s;ternation? But then the Query is, whether &s;uch Shocks are the Fruit of Guilt or of Grace, of Ignorance or of Knowledge, of Faith or Unbelief, of Hope or De&s;pair?</P>
<P>Before we come to make clo&s;er Remarks upon particular Arguments here, it may be, it will not be ami&s;s to tran&s;cribe a Paragraph out of Mr. <HI>Burrough</HI>'s <HI>Irenicum,</HI> pag. 84.85. "<HI>The &s;ixth dividing Principle,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>is, What is be&s;t in it&s;elf mu&s;t be cho&s;en and done, not weighing Circum&s;tances or References.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>It is,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>in it&s;elf a better Thing to enjoy a Mini&s;try of the mo&s;t eminent Gift and Graces, than one of lower, but if this &s;hould be made a Rule, that a Man who is under a Pa&s;tor, who is faithful and in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure gifted, upon another Man's coming into the Country, that is more eminent, he &s;hould for&s;ake his Pa&s;tor and join to the other; and if after this &s;till a more eminent Man comes, he &s;hould leave the former and join to him; and by the &s;ame Law, a Pa&s;tor, who hath a good People, yet if others be more likely to receive more Good, he may leave his own People, and go to them; what Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order would there be continually in the Church? Men mu&s;t con&s;ider not only what the Thing is in it's own Nature, but what it is to them, how it &s;tands in Reference to their Relations. If you be joined to a Pa&s;tor, &s;o as you believe he is &s;et over you by Chri&s;t, to be a Pa&s;tor to you, though this Man hath meaner Gifts than others, and it would he more comfortable for you to have another Pa&s;tor; yet this is not enough to cau&s;e you to de&s;ert him whom Chri&s;t hath &s;et over you; and if People may not leave their Pa&s;tors, becau&s;e others have more eminent Gifts, then &s;urely Pa&s;tors mu&s;t not leave their People, becau&s;e others have more eminent Livings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>T.</HI> here points out three or four Cau&s;es, which he a&s;&s;erts to be &s;ufficient Grounds to ju&s;tify Men in de&s;erting their own
<PB N="109" REF="004792_0055_100DEEA2D7A066A0">
Mini&s;ter's Admini&s;trations, and to go for ordinary to hear another, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;eems to a&s;&s;ert, That People's Notion of their own Mini&s;ter's having <HI>le&s;&s;er Gifts than a Stranger,</HI> will ju&s;tify the De&s;erting of the former, and going to the latter <HI>frequently.</HI> pag. 19.20.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. Is not &s;uch an idolizing Preference of Men upon the Account of &s;uperior Gifts, a Reflection upon the Wi&s;dom of the Author of all Gifts, for his u&s;ing Variety in the Di&s;tribution of Gifts, who gives to one <HI>five,</HI> to another <HI>two,</HI> to another <HI>one Talent?</HI> Mu&s;t he that hath one Talent be left idle, if he lives nigh one that hath two, and he that hath two be left idle if he lives nigh one that hath five Talents? If &s;o, what could he do that had but one Talent, but hide it in a Napkin, if he lived among &s;uch People as Mr. <HI>T.</HI> would have all to be? How could he make U&s;e of it? And would not &s;uch a Method excu&s;e him that had two in doing in the &s;ame manner? Be&s;ides, when a whole Congregation and the Pre&s;bytery, after &s;olemn calling upon God, and upon fair Trial, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be liable to mi&s;take, who no doubt judge a Man to have at lea&s;t a Compe|tency of Gifts, when they give him a Call; and it may be &s;till on good Grounds judge that the de&s;pi&s;ed Mini&s;ter hath five Talents, and the admired Stranger but two or one; why may not the Di&s;&s;atisfied under Di&s;gu&s;t take the one or two for the five Talents? Is not there more Safety in the Multitude of Coun&s;ellors now as well as in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Time? Further, how without equal Trial of both Mini&s;ters, can any Man form an adequate Judgment of Men's Gifts? Is it not common for Men to admire a Stranger for once or twice wonderfully, whom after a While they think le&s;s of than their own Mini&s;ters? And may not Men of good Judgment ea&s;ily mi&s;take a Per&s;on's Gifts or real Worth upon a tran&s;ient Trial? For is it not known, that one may excel in Judgment, the other in Delivery; the one hath better Matter, the other more flouri&s;hing Language; the one in Solidity, the other in making a fair Appearance; the one is more zealous, the other is more &s;tedfa&s;t; every one having his peculiar Gifts; and is it not well known, that empty Barrels and &s;hallow Waters make always the loude&s;t Sound?</P>

yet would not &s;uch a Practice upon &s;uch Grounds be idolizing of In&s;truments, by &s;u&s;pending the Succe&s;s or Benefit of Sermons upon the Gifts of the Preacher, and not on the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the Co-operation of his Spirit? May not he that hath le&s;s or no Grace excel in Gifts? and mu&s;t a gifted Hy|pocrite be a fitter In&s;trument for God to work by, than a pious Mini&s;ter of le&s;s Gifts, and therefore encouraged when the other is de&s;erted? Hath not God often owned a Man of le&s;&s;er Gifts, that is pious, to make him more &s;ucce&s;sful than others more gifted? And is not this a very u&s;ual Thing, if not God's mo&s;t common Way, that he may learn us to cea&s;e from Man, and that no Fle&s;h &s;hould glory before Him, but that He alone might be exalted? Be&s;ides, tho' we allow, that when a Congre|gation is vacant, that it is their Duty and Intere&s;t to endeavour by all means, to get a Pa&s;tor of the be&s;t Gifts they can; but yet is it not one Thing to be wi&s;e and wary in chu&s;ing a Mini|&s;ter and contracting a Pa&s;toral Relation, but another Thing to break and cut the Bond of that Relation, after it is voluntarily entered into and contracted? May not there be room for many Con&s;iderations to take Place, to &s;way the Choice in making a Match, which would appear both ridiculous and &s;inful when pleaded to be ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Divorce, after the Marriage-Knot is tied? But yet doth not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> ju&s;tify this Latitude or Licence by putting the married and unmarried upon a Par, as to a &s;econd Choice, from <HI>p.</HI> 18 &mdash; 22, even &s;uppo&s;ing a Per&s;on's <HI>Pa&s;tor be gracious?</HI> We grant, his Rea&s;onings may hold in making a Choice before &s;uch a Relation be contracted; but how can it afterwards, when the Choice is made and the Match is concluded, not for a Day or during Plea&s;ure only, but as long as by God's good Providence the &s;aid Relation continues, or until it be di&s;&s;olved in an orderly Way? And does not this appear to be Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s Mind, if we con&s;ider the Topicks he argues from, <HI>viz. The Birds of the Air, the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, and the wild Bea&s;ts of the Field?</HI> If there comes out an Act again&s;t Metaphors, &s;hould not there be a Clau&s;e in it, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Rhetorician &s;hould never u&s;e an Argument, for fear he may come too near to the Heels of Truth? For might not <HI>the tame A&s;s that knoweth his Owner, and the Ox that waiteth at his Ma&s;ier's Crib,</HI> learn Mr. <HI>T.</HI> a better Le&s;&s;on to the Purpo&s;e in Hard, than wild Fowls Fi&s;hes or Bea&s;ts, who have no certain Owner, Place or Crib Pa&s;tor or Ruler, Law or Rule of Government, nor capable of

having any, but are le&s;t to wander as their natural In&s;tinct leads them? And yet do not the&s;e ob&s;erve &s;ome Order in keeping to their own Flock, and &s;ome of them to their own Mates, not|with&s;tanding their Wanderings and Want of Rea&s;on? Where then is the Similitude between &s;uch Creatures and Church-Members, who are rational Creatures, under a Law, proper Pa&s;tor, divided into &s;tated Companies, and under Vows and &s;olemn Ties to continue in Church Fellow&s;hip, and under the Pa&s;toral Rod and Care of a fixed Pa&s;tor, who is inve&s;ted with the Authority of a Steward, both to feed and to rule his parti|cular Flock, as a di&s;tinct Body or Hou&s;hold? And are not all the orderly Relations of rational Creatures, whether natural, civil or religious, fixed and &s;tated by particular Bounds and Limits, within which Men &s;hould keep at lea&s;t for ordinary? And what is good Order in Church or State, but the due Ob&s;er|vation of our proper Limits, by performing the Duties of our Relations in proper Place and Time, without Neglect, as well as without Encroachment or di&s;turbing of others in their proper Places and Relations? Will Mr. <HI>T.</HI> tell us, what is that ordinary Calling or Relation in Church or State of God's Appointment, whereby Men are called to become Wanderers or Vagabonds, as the Fowls of the Air, Fi&s;hes, or wild Bea&s;ts? Doth not the Chri&s;tian Religion in its very Nature, according to the &s;tated Di&s;pen&s;ation we are now under, exclude and forbid &s;uch Wan|derings any further than Nece&s;&s;ity or Conveniency requires them? And are not all Wandrings out of meer Choice, our Wanton|ne&s;s and Sin? As therefore Mr. <HI>T.</HI> well ob&s;erves, that a Work may be a Duty in the Matter of it, when it is a Sin in the Manner, if not performed according to the Rule; we would a&s;k, whether or no the Duty of Preaching may not be abu&s;ed this Way, as much as any other Duty, by Men de&s;erting their own Flocks, and intruding in a di&s;orderly Manner into the Labours of other pious Mini&s;ters, to withdraw their Flocks from them? And as great Dupes and Dunces as Mr. <HI>T.</HI> counts is, we challenge him, or any of his Party to reconcile &s;uch Practices to Scripture-Rule, the Pre&s;byterian-Plan, or even to right Rea&s;on and Charity? But to return to the Matter in Hand; who doubts, but that in chu&s;ing Pa&s;tors as well as Wives, Men &s;hould <HI>&s;eek the be&s;t Gifts;</HI> but yet mu&s;t we be chu&s;ing every Day for ever, without any Regard to the Choice already made, and the Relation already contracted? Is it not
<PB N="112" REF="004792_0057_100DEEA7244EBD20">
our Duty, when bound to a Mini&s;ter, as well as to a Wife, to &s;tand to the Choice made, and to fulfil the re&s;pective Duties of that Relation? May not tho&s;e Gifts be be&s;t and fitte&s;t for me, which God in his Providence carves out for me, tho' they be not be&s;t in them&s;elves, or in my E&s;teem and Conceit; and when Men &s;tand related upon a &s;olemn Choice, &s;hould not all that are bound to an orderly Mini&s;ter in an orderly Way, believe this, notwith&s;tanding corrupt Rea&s;on or Inclination &s;ugge&s;t the contrary? For when Mini&s;ters are but In&s;truments, what hath a more direct Tendency to an&s;wer or reach the de&s;igned End, than a careful and clo&s;e Ob&s;ervation of God's In&s;titutions in u&s;ing Means and In&s;truments, without con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood? That <HI>there is a Difference or variety of Gifts, and that Men &s;hould be duly re&s;pected upon the Account of &s;uperior Gifts,</HI> we own, but will it follow thence, that we are to contemn our own Mini&s;ter, if he hath a Competency of Gifts, by with|drawing our Attendance upon his Mini&s;try, any more than that a Man &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e his own virtuous Wife, becau&s;e &s;ome fine Lady in the Town is more beautiful than &s;he? For is it not well known, that plain Preaching may be more edifying to the Vulgar than profound Doctrine, which may be more edifying to Men of greater Capacities? For is not a wooden Key that opens the Lock, better than a golden one that makes a fidling Din in the Wards, and yet confounds them? Is not &s;ound Scripture Doctrine the true Food of Souls, and what is truly edifying? And is not Truth, in her &s;ober homely Garb, more edifying than gaudy Error, &s;pruced up with all the Fineries of the Scene or Stage, or bug-beared with all the Horns that can &s;tick upon its hydratick Heads? And if Mr. <HI>T</HI>'s Sermons be &s;tripped of the Padlock of Pen and Inkhorn Terms, what Sermons are there preached among us, but what will more than equalize this Sermon of his, as well as Mr. <HI>W</HI>'s Sermons, for old Truth? And doth not &s;ound Matter edify better than ear-plea&s;ing empty Sounds? But how great &s;oever Men's Gifts be, mu&s;t not God carry on <HI>a Series of Miracles as long as there is a Series of true Conver&s;ion Work</HI> carried on in the World: why then &s;hould Mr. <HI>T.</HI> count this unnece&s;&s;ary, or the &s;uppo&s;ing this unrea&s;onable? How alien to the Matter in Hand is the Exam|ple of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t's Hearers, and tho&s;e of the Phari&s;ees, coming to hear Chri&s;t, not only upon Week-Days, but upon Sabbath-Days, whom Chri&s;t reproved not?</HI> For may not a mean Capacity

In what Part of the World was <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI>'s Pari&s;h?

<P N="2">2. Another Thing that is pleaded to be &s;ufficient Grounds to ju&s;tify People to for&s;ake their own Mini&s;ter, and to go to hear others for ordinary, is, <HI>the Judgment and Inclination of People ballancing that Way.</HI></P>
<P>Before we come to lay down Queries, we &s;hall premi&s;e a few Words: As to the Noi&s;e here made about <HI>binding Men again&s;t their Judgment and Inclination, to a particular Mini&s;ter;</HI> if levelled again&s;t our Synod, it is entirely a fal&s;e Charge, as we hinted already; for none are bound with us but by their own free and voluntary Choice and Con&s;ent; all the Binding that can be pretended to be, is that we plead, that it is the Duty of the Members of a particular Congregation, who have a fixed Pa&s;tor, to attend for ordinary upon his Mini&s;try, while he is their orderly Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> I. When it is Chri&s;t's Appointment, that every Congre|gation &s;hould have their own Pa&s;tor, and every Pa&s;tor his own Flock; how can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> have the Face to out-face the Truth &s;o far, as to &s;ay, that obliging Church-Members to wait upon the Go&s;pel Admini&s;trations of their own Pa&s;tor, <HI>is an un&s;criptural Infringement on Chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> unle&s;s he can prove that the Relation of Pa&s;tor and People is an human Invention? Can Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ay, that this is any more than Chri&s;t's ea&s;y Yoke? How terribly then doth Mr. <HI>T.</HI> mi&s;repre&s;ent the Matter, when he &s;aith, <HI>that it is a wor&s;e Yoke than that of</HI> Rome <HI>it&s;elf?</HI> to prove which he quotes Dr. <HI>Voetius,</HI> who a&s;&s;erts, <HI>That even among Papi&s;ts, as to hearing of Sermons, the People are not deprived of
<PB N="114" REF="004792_0058_100DEEA8DEA9BB40">
the Liberty of Choice.</HI> If the Account be true, whether or no one orthodox Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter, be not worth a Thou&s;and popi&s;h begging Friars with all their Trumpery? Suppo&s;e then, that the Pope allows the People a free Election or Choice of their own Pa&s;tors, if this were true, are not Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters fully as orthodox as he is in this Point? For hath not he Mi&s;&s;io|naries, but none of our Mini&s;ters will cope with him, except Mr. <HI>T.</HI> will? For what el&s;e can we call Mr. <HI>F.</HI> who re&s;ides with us this Winter? If the Pope allows People to chu&s;e a Pa&s;tor to-day, and to reject him to morrow, upon the bare Plea of <HI>their own Judgment and Inclination,</HI> is it any Wonder that Prote&s;tants di&s;&s;ent from Papi&s;ts in this Point, when they differ in as material Ones be&s;ides? For is it not the Pope's old Rule to People, <HI>Come you over to me in Ceremonials, and I will come over to you in Morals?</HI> And without we would go all the Way to the <HI>Delphic Oracle,</HI> we cannot expect a Scheme that will &s;uit the Inclinations of the Generality better than his: Well, but will not we have as good Company, if we have the Vogue of all &s;ound Prote&s;tant Reformers on our Side, albeit Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;hould be &s;o happy as to have the Pope on his? What &s;ort of an A&s;pect is it when &s;ome of the Stars of the fir&s;t Magnitude in this lower Orb, are in &s;omething like a Conjunction with the Dragon's Tail, in the Points they di&s;&s;ent from their Brethren? Hath not <HI>Rome</HI> been much abu&s;ed, and Prote&s;tant Writers much mi&s;taken, if the News be true that the Prote&s;tant Yoke, even among Conformi&s;ts, is wor&s;e than the Romi&s;h Yoke? And may not Non-conformi&s;ts &s;peak one Word more than they &mdash; in the Matter? All that we can &s;ay is, that we cannot wi&s;h any of our Fellow-Subjects as great an Evil, as to have the Trial of both; for was not it an unhappy Day when King <HI>Lucius</HI> bartered a Crown of Gold for a Crown of Thorns, by laying down his Scepter at the Feet of him that bore a Reed? But more Fury &s;till; for Mr. <HI>T.</HI> adds, <HI>It is a Yoke like that of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>which cruel</HI> Pharoah <HI>formed for the Necks of the oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> I&s;raelites, <HI>when he obliged them to make up their &s;tated Ta&s;k of Brick, but allowed them no Straw; &s;o we mu&s;t now grow in Grace and Knowledge, but in the mean Time, according to the Notion of &s;ome, we are confined from u&s;ing the likelie&s;t Means to attain the End.</HI> Is not this an hard Ca&s;e? But the Query is, whether the People's Ta&s;k, or Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s Ta&s;k is the greate&s;t, who was obliged to travel all the Way to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to find an equal Yoke to the
<PB N="115" REF="004792_0058_100DEEA8DEA9BB40">
Go&s;pel-Yoke, but is it not &s;on Comfort that he mu&s;t not go further? for hath not he found one like it now? We never till now heard the Que&s;tion re&s;olved whether the Pope's or <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Yoke was the Heavie&s;t, but it would &s;eem that Catholicks reckon <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Yoke much wor&s;e; Why &s;o? Is it becau&s;e they &s;eel a Burden upon the Body more than double the Weight upon the Con&s;cience, becau&s;e the latter is tender? But when Mr. <HI>T.</HI> allows, that <HI>the &s;ame Word is preached in the Pari&s;h, that is preached out of the Pari&s;h Line;</HI> is it any Lo&s;s that People are bereaved of Straw in their &s;piritual Food? If this be the Ca&s;e, will not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s and <HI>We&s;ley</HI>'s Books, and this Sermon of Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;upply all our Pari&s;hes with more than enough of Straw, Hay and Stubble too, &s;o that we have no Need to go out of the Pari&s;h Line to fetch more? And when the &s;ame Word is preached by an orthodox &s;tated Pa&s;tor without Straw, how are Men confined from the likelie&s;t Means, to attain Growth in Grace? But what if thro' Want or Weakne&s;s of Judgment, wavering In&s;tability, Double-mindedne&s;s, Wantonne&s;s, Pride, Love of Novelties, itching Ears, Curio&s;ity or delu&s;ive Fancies, People are inclined not to hear &s;ound Doctrine, being like <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old, <HI>loving to wander, without refraining her Feet,</HI> Jer. 14.10. and to <HI>go after her Lovers, that gave her her Bread and her Water, her Wool and her Flax, her Oil and her Drink,</HI> Ho&s;. 2.5. yea, to <HI>&s;catter her Ways unto Strangers under every green Tree,</HI> Jer. 3.13. Will it be the Part of the good Shepherd to &s;uffer the Sheep to go a&s;tray, as oft and as long and as far as &s;uch an Inclination leads them, or hath not God entru&s;ted his Servants <HI>with a Rod</HI> to <HI>revenge all Di&s;obedience?</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.21. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.6. Are not Sheep to follow their own Shepherds in what they follow Chri&s;t, and to obey their own Rulers in the Lord, &s;triving in the Strength of his Grace, to bring every Judgment, Thought and Inclination into Captivity, to the Obedience of Chri&s;t, praying that he may incline their Hearts to perform his Statutes always even unto the End, as knowing it to be both the Sin and the Puni&s;hment of the Back-&s;lider <HI>to be filled with his own Ways?</HI> To conclude this, we would a&s;k, Whether bringing Religion to truckle to the Humours of the People, be not the ready Way to de&s;troy Religion and the People? As for In&s;tance, <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> demanding of his Coun&s;ellors, Whether he might marry his Si&s;ter by the Law of the Land? They an|&s;wered, That they found no Law, that allowed a Brother to

<P N="3">3.

Whether the commanded Duty, or the Neglect or Counter-acting of it, is fatal? Is the &s;acred Relation between Mini&s;ter and People &s;uch an Atom, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> cannot &s;ee it without a Micro&s;cope? Is Men's &s;olemn Choice, and the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;al of Providence, in bringing Men into &s;uch a particular Relation to their Mini&s;ter, a Nullity? Are Men's &s;olemn Vows of attending upon their own Mini&s;ter's Admini&s;trations, No|thing?

May not a purblind Man &s;ee, that this is &s;ome Rea&s;on, why Men &s;hould ordinarily attend upon the Admini&s;trations of their &s;tated Pa&s;tor?

Do not all Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s An&s;wers to the&s;e Objections plainly &s;uppo&s;e, that the Members of particular Congregations &s;tand in as great an Indifferency, and that ju&s;tly, to hear their own cho&s;en and &s;tated Pa&s;tor, to whom they &s;tand related, as any other Mini&s;ter, whom they plea&s;e to apply to? But if the Matter were really &s;o, what &s;erves the pa&s;toral Relation for? Is it not contracted in vain, at lea&s;t to no good Purpo&s;e? For if the Mem|bers of a particular Congregation are no more obliged to attend upon their own Pa&s;tor's mini&s;terial Admini&s;trations, than tho&s;e of a Stranger, who comes any how in their Way; will it not follow, that the Mini&s;ter is no more obliged to &s;erve his own People than any others? And if &s;o, will it not be Time to &s;ound a Retreat, <HI>Return ye every Man to his Tent,</HI> wander ye Shepherds, &s;catter ye Sheep, and let every Man &s;hift for him|&s;elf? And can the Devil de&s;ire better Advocates, than &s;uch as &s;ay, that no Man is in Brother's Keeper? And &s;o in&s;tead of <HI>Wo to him that is alone,</HI> mu&s;t not he be pronounced the happy Man? For he breaketh no Bonds, <HI>and if he falleth,</HI> &s;hall not he lie down as long as he plea&s;eth? For who will give him the unwelcome Di&s;turbance of <HI>helping him up?</HI> And &s;o was it not a brave Time, when there <HI>was no King in I&s;rael?</HI> For had not Men then full Liberty, to <HI>do what &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d good in their own Eyes,</HI> as their Inclinations prompted them? And &s;o, in&s;tead of calling the Sheep that were without a Shepherd, to lament, might not Mr. <HI>T.</HI> agreeably to the Strain of his Application here, rai&s;e an U&s;e of Con&s;olation, and pronounce them an happy People, both upon the Account of the Bereavement, and al&s;o upon the Account of their Opportunity of getting a non-&s;uch Pa&s;tor, who upon hearing their Declarations, would pre&s;ently read their Hearts, and tell them Dreams as fa&s;t as they could tell him Fal&s;hoods?</P>

of which in &s;ome Time obtains a Mini&s;ter &s;ettled and fixed among them as their Pa&s;tor, to the good Liking of the whole Congregation; we will again &s;uppo&s;e, that the other Congre|gation &s;ome Time after, al&s;o gets a Mini&s;ter to &s;ettle among them to be their Pa&s;tor, which la&s;t Mini&s;ter is vi&s;ibly to all Appearance &s;uperiour to the fir&s;t in Gifts and Accompli&s;hments; now we would a&s;k, Whether the Superiority of the Gifts in the &s;econd Mini&s;ter, would be a ju&s;t Rea&s;on for the other Congre|gation to leave their own Mini&s;ter, that is, merely becau&s;e the other Mini&s;ter excells him in Gifts, or their imbibing a Conceit that they &s;hall be better edified el&s;ewhere, while in the mean Time they cannot charge their own Mini&s;ter with any Blemi&s;hes in Doctrine or Conver&s;ation, and his Gifts are what they were &s;atisfied with, and gladly took up with at fir&s;t? If &s;o, would not this be to cen&s;ure, yea in Effect to depo&s;e a faithful &s;ufficient Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, yea to ca&s;hier him, becau&s;e the &s;overeign God hath thought fit to give a greater Mea&s;ure of Gifts to another?

For if Matters be thus, will it not follow, that when a Mini&s;ter is invited or called to fix as a Pa&s;tor among a People, the true Meaning and Engli&s;h of the People calling that Mini&s;ter, is no more than this, <HI>viz. We are willing and contract to receive you as our Pa&s;tor now, but with this Re&s;ervation, that as &s;oon as we or any of us can get an Op|portunity of a better, we will be no longer bound to you, altho' we &s;hould have no Fault to lay to your Charge?</HI> Is all the re&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h?</HI> And if this be rational, orderly, di&s;creet and becoming the Piety of the Church, or the Dignity of the mini&s;terial Character, let Rea&s;on judge. And finally, we would a&s;k, whether the Mini|&s;ter hath not as great a Liberty to leave his Congregation, or any part of them? If &s;o, where is there any Obligation or pa&s;toral Relation between them? And is not the fixing of a Pa&s;tor in a Place a meer Notion?

to hear his People &s;ay and plead, that they are <HI>better edified el&s;ewhere,</HI> than by his Mini&s;try? when it can be proven, that his Doctrine is <HI>&s;ound Speech that cannot be condemned;</HI> when, at the &s;ame Time, the Writings of the much admired Preachers are a meer Hotch-Potch of Truth and Error; yea, and even Void of Common Sen&s;e in many Places?

May not &s;uch and the like Appearances of the Want of Love to Truth and Order, as well as of Di&s;regard to Chri&s;t's Au|thority, and their own real Good, ju&s;tly grieve a pious Pa&s;tor, who weighs the Matter right, when he &s;ees a likely Congre|gation once, in a likely Way to &s;catter and to break to Pieces, after all his Pains to gather and keep them together, meerly for Want of Men's Studying to be quiet, and to do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, as we are taught in 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> iv. 11?

<P>Qu. VIII. Whereas Mr. <HI>T.</HI> adds, <HI>That it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, that pious Souls &s;hould maintain Union and Harmony among them|&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding of their different Opinions in le&s;&s;er Things. And, no doubt, this is the Drift of the many Exhortations we have

to Peace and Unity in Scripture.</HI> Well then, &s;hould not pious Mini&s;ters write good Patterns, in being &s;tudious to maintain Union and Harmony among them&s;elves too? For what but the Want of this among the Mini&s;ters, is the Cau&s;e of all the Con|fu&s;ion among the People? And are not the Things wherein Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party differ from the Re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters of our Synod, as far as hath yet openly appeared in their Debates, Things of a le&s;&s;er Nature, whatever this new Confu&s;ion may breed? How then doth Mr. <HI>T.</HI> follow his own Pre&s;criptions here? For can he think, that his divi&s;ive anarchical Methods of &s;triving to make Rents and Factions, are the proper Methods to maintain Union and Harmony? Can any &s;erious Chri&s;tian think, that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> and his Party would like it well, if their Brethren, who are at &s;ome Difference with them, &s;hould be as indu&s;trious in their Bounds, as they have been el&s;ewhere, to withdraw their Hearers from them, and to di&s;turb their Peace and Order? Or if they &s;hould approve of &s;uch Methods, would it not argue, that they had not any great Regard for the Souls of their Flock? If the Meaning of this be, that this Union and Harmony is only to be maintained with their own Partizans; as it &s;eems to be, if we ob&s;erve the Conduct, towards others, of a Knot of Gentlemen, who &s;et up their own Party for the only true Catholicks or &s;piritual Men: If this be the Intent, is not the Law of the right Phari&s;ee, a Popi&s;h Cut? For did not the former teach Men, <HI>thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy? Matth.</HI> v. 43. And did not the latter teach Men, <HI>that no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks?</HI> But doth not Scrip|ture teach us, that there is a Peace and Unity that we are to cultivate with all Men as much as po&s;&s;ible, much more with all Prote&s;tants of different Denominations, and much more with tho&s;e in our own Dominions than tho&s;e in <HI>Moravia?</HI> And why may not there be Peace and Unity, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, &s;ingular, which we are to cultivate with tho&s;e of our Denomination or Society, without being Guilty of Bigotry? And &s;eeing Mr. <HI>T.</HI> on this Head, mentions <HI>the Unity of the Legion of Devils in one Man, and of</HI> Ahab's <HI>fal&s;e Prophets, which were four Hundred Daubers, &amp;c.</HI> in order to ca&s;t Contempt on the Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ters; we would a&s;k, what Sort of an Union and Harmony there is between him, and Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> when the Writings of the former of the two la&s;t, is a motley Mixture of Truth and Error, Popery and Prote&s;tanti&s;m, <HI>Antinomiani&s;m, Armini|ani&s;m,

And if they are faithful, can we give away to another their ju&s;t Due? And is not this done, if we neglect to attend upon their Mini&s;try ordinarily?

Yea, let it be granted, that Members of Con|gregations may, without Offence, take their Liberty to go to hear other neighbouring, orderly Mini&s;ters, or a Stranger that comes in an orderly Manner, occa&s;ionally, and at Sea&s;ons: Yet, doth not the Ca&s;e alter, when Men come in a di&s;orderly, intru|ding Manner, to make Parties, &s;etting up Thre&s;hold again&s;t Thre&s;hold, and Altar again&s;t Altar, pre&s;&s;ing People to for&s;ake their own &s;tated orderly Pa&s;tors, upon trivial Excu&s;es and Sur|mi&s;es; and abu&s;ing &s;uch as cleave to their own Pa&s;tors with op|probrious Names of <HI>Dupes and Dunces, &amp;c.</HI> when Men &s;end their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, indu&s;triou&s;ly to foment and keep up Factions and Divi&s;ions, and when Men labour to ca&s;t Contempt and Di&s;|dain upon other Mini&s;ters, by Carnalizing and Phari&s;izing them meerly for oppo&s;ing Errors and Di&s;orders?

And if the Ca&s;e were the &s;ame now, as to the Pa&s;tor and Itinerant, would it not de&s;erve the &s;ame Cen&s;ure?

Cannot Man be limited to wait upon God in a Way of Duty, according to God's Appoint|ments, but this mu&s;t limit God? Doth God's limiting the Ocean, imply that he is thereby limited? Did God's bringing Man under a Law or Covenant, which limited Man in Point of Duty, any Way limit God in Point of Grace? If &s;o, how &s;hould there be any Room for God to enter into a &s;econd Co|venant with fallen Sinners, in and thro' a Mediator? Was God limited by his limiting his publick Wor&s;hip in a peculiar Manner at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> or by his limiting the Prie&s;thood to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Aaron</HI> and the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> even tho' all the Con|gregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was holy? And yet did not <HI>Korah,</HI> tho' a <HI>Levite,</HI> &s;uffer Vengeance for attempting to cro&s;s and confound the Limits God put between the Hou&s;e of <HI>Aaron</HI> and the <HI>Levites,</HI> and tho&s;e between the <HI>Levites</HI> and the re&s;t of the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael?</HI> And is not this written for our In&s;truction? Is God limited by his confining the publick Admini&s;tration of his publick Church-Ordinances to publick Officers regularly called; or by his fixing a &s;tated Relation between a particular Pa&s;tor and a particular Flock, any more than he is limited as to the Continuation of Mankind, by fixing a particular Relation between an Hu&s;band and Wife? But who among us limit God more in this Matter; than tho&s;e who &s;u&s;pend the <HI>Succe&s;s of</HI> &s;acred Admi|ni&s;trations upon the <HI>Gifts or Grace of the Mini&s;ter or Inclination of the People,</HI> yea than tho&s;e that pronounce the <HI>&s;ame Word,</HI> preached by the Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter unedifying, that is pronounced edifying when preached out of the Pari&s;h Lines, as if Di&s;order it&s;elf would &s;ecure the Succe&s;s; or than tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert that Men mu&s;t have &s;uch and &s;uch high Degrees of Law-Terrors, in order to Conver&s;ion and mu&s;t be kept for a con&s;iderable Time under them, in order to bring them to the Birth, pronouncing all unconverted, who are not brought home in &s;uch an ob&s;ervable Manner, as to be able to account for the Manner of their Con|ver&s;ion by Feelings; as if God's Cords of Grace and Love had lo&s;t their Strength and Force? Is it not very &s;trange, that Men who count the Fixing the Bounds of Man's Duty the Limiting of God, do unawares on the other Hand really &s;tint and pre|&s;cribe the Manner that God &s;hall carry on Conver&s;ion Work?
<PB N="144" REF="004792_0073_100DEFFD50663630">
How alien to the Purpo&s;e in Hand is Mr. <HI>T.</HI>'s quoting &s;everal Scriptures to prove God's Un&s;earchablene&s;s, in order as it would &s;eem to prove, that People may or ought to for&s;ake their own Mini&s;ter for ordinary, and go to hear others, upon the Grounds afore&s;aid? May not a Man with half an Eye &s;ee, that to draw &s;uch an Inference from the Doctrine of God's Un&s;earchablene&s;s, is a palpable incon&s;equential Con&s;equence, which cannot be forced from it with any Colour of Rea&s;on? For doth not this prove, that <HI>he is a God nigh at Hand as well as a God afar off,</HI> or within as well as without the Pari&s;h Line? Tho' God be un&s;earchable and his Ways pa&s;t finding out; yet hath not he declared his Statutes to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;hewed Man what is good, &s;o that he that reads may run in the Way of Duty? Tho' his Spirit <HI>like the Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth,</HI> as being a free Agent in all his gracious Operations; yet hath not he made it our Duty <HI>to watch daily at his Gates, and to wait at the Po&s;ts of his Doors; and hath not he commanded the Ble&s;&s;ing, even Life, upon the Mountains of Zion?</HI> Prov. 8.34. P&s;. 133.3. Tho' <HI>Jehovah rides upon the gloomy Cloud;</HI> yet hath not he made it our Duty to <HI>walk in the Way of his Commandments?</HI> Tho' <HI>he makes Darkne&s;s his Pavilion,</HI> doth not he require, that we &s;hould <HI>walk in the Light?</HI> Tho' <HI>his Paths are in the great Waters,</HI> yet hath not he made it our Duty <HI>to keep upon a &s;ure Foundation,</HI> and not to venture into the deep Waters, le&s;t we &s;ink too &s;oon? But what is this to the Matter in Hand? For when we know that God is un&s;earchable, is it Wi&s;dom for us to take the Wings of the Morning to try to &s;earch him out, by climbing up to Heaven, or going into the Deep, or by riding upon the Clouds of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or by dwelling in the Darkne&s;s of Ignorance, Errors and Di&s;orders, and be &s;ure to dwell the appointed Time in the deep Waters of Di&s;comfort and De&s;pair, according to the new forged Canon, till &s;ome petty Pope &s;igns an Ab&s;olution; and in order to find &s;uch unhappy Paths, de&s;ert our own Pa&s;tors, who are not like to lead poor Souls into them, becau&s;e they fear God, love his Word, pity Souls, con&s;idering them&s;elves? Is not this a rare Piece of my&s;tical Divinity? It is a great Truth, that God is every where, and worketh where, when and as he li&s;teth; yet is this any Rule for Men to go over the Pari&s;h Line, rather than into the Pari&s;h-Kirk, when God's e&s;&s;ential Pre&s;ence is in both alike, without the lea&s;t Difference? For may not he that tarries at home, and goes to neither of the two,
<PB N="145" REF="004792_0073_100DEFFD50663630">
make as good a Plea for him&s;elf as either of the two, that he limits not God; for may not he &s;ay, that God may as well meet him upon his Bed or his Fire-&s;ide as in the Church or Field? For who can &s;ay, but that God may as well wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k without and contrary to Means as with them? For how el&s;e was the Spirit of Prophe&s;y poured down on Mr. <HI>Wd.</HI> when reading a Play-Book? Is not this a fine Droll to wound Religion under the fifth Rib, when we pretend to &s;tand up for it? For by Parity of Rea&s;on, may not Men without any great Stretch further, tell us, that we &s;hould not confine our&s;elves to read our Bibles or other Scriptural Books, in order to our Chri&s;tian Improvement, left we limit God? Shall we once more &s;ee the Time, when it will be told that a Play-Book, Pack of Cards, and the Book of Sports, mu&s;t have their Turns, that Satan may be let loo&s;e under the Pretence of Go&s;pel Liberty? For may not the Pretence of not limiting of God, with little more Courage, &s;erve to cloak all as well as &s;ome Di&s;orders? But yet, is not God's Word a &s;urer Rule by far, which teacheth that every particular Congregation are to have their particular Pa&s;tor? When therefore God hath by his Providence brought us to a particular Relation to a Godly Mini&s;ter, Have not we better Grounds in the Word of Truth, to expect God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon the Labours of an orderly Mini&s;ter, whom we in Obedience to Chri&s;t, have &s;olemnly cho&s;en according to Divine In&s;titution, to take the Over-&s;ight of us in the Lord, than upon the Admini&s;trations of a di&s;orderly Intruder? Is it not evident, that neither Mini&s;ter nor People can fulfil the Duties of that Relation to each other, without walking in Fellow&s;hip with each other in attending upon Go&s;pel-Ordinances according to God's Word, <HI>without for&s;aking their own A&s;&s;emblies?</HI> With|out &s;uch an Attendance, what is the Pa&s;toral Relation but an empty Sound and meer Mockery? If then the Ties or Bonds of this Relation, which is God's In&s;titution, obliges the Flock to attend upon the pa&s;toral Admini&s;trations of their own Pa&s;tor, as well as their own &s;olemn Vows made at their contracting &s;uch a Relation; can any in Faith expect, that the <HI>King who is held in the Galleries,</HI> will be more likely to meet them, by their &s;tarting out of their a&s;&s;igned Po&s;t and Place, than by keeping in it? Will any tell us, what is that Cau&s;e which the Scripture a&s;&s;igns as &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the ordinary For&s;aking, or Non-Attendance of a &s;tated Member of a Congregation upon the regular &s;acred Admini&s;trations of an orderly Pa&s;tor, while the

&s;aid Relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and no providential Let &s;tands in the Way? For is it not a great Truth, that no act of Religion, how glaring and &s;pecious &s;oever, hath a real Tendency to advance the Glory of God, or to promote the real Good of Souls, than when due Regard is had in the Performance of it to the Rule of God's Word, both as to the Matter and Manner? And can we think, that tho&s;e Acts, which tho' for the Matter may be good or middling, yet as to their Manner are downright irregular, and di&s;honourable to God and Religion, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed for our greater Good, than tho&s;e which both for the Matter and Man|ner are &s;criptural? Or may not we rather expect, that if we lead our &s;elves into Temptation, by going to ramble out of the Way of Duty, by de&s;erting our proper Guides and Station, that this may provoke God to de&s;ert us, to remove our Candle&s;ticks, and encourage Satan to tempt us with &s;uch delu&s;ive Notions as may make Truth and Duty hateful to us, becau&s;e contrary to our wandring Inclinations, and vain Admiration of Per&s;ons, and Love to vain Janglings?</P>
