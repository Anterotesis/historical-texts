<PB N="4" REF="003142_0005_0FF0109494770380">either Side, in all the points to be Deba|ted. And Two things they in&s;i&s;ted on;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, That the pre&s;ent <HI>Engli&s;h Ver|&s;ion of the Bible</HI> might be adher'd to on both &s;ides, &amp; no <HI>Terms</HI> or <HI>Phra&s;es</HI> in it <HI>objected again&s;t</HI> as what were capable of Amendment: And to induce to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance on our part, Mr. <HI>Mo&s;s</HI> gave us the following piece of Hi&s;tory, viz. <HI>That the &s;aid Ver&s;ion was made from the Original Languages by Seventy men, all which as they acted under a Sentence of Death in ca&s;e of &V;nfaithfulne&s;s, and went through the whole Work in Solitude, being each alone in a &s;eparate Apartment; &s;o afterward, on a comparing their &s;everal Performances, were not found to differ in any thing Material.</HI> By which tis manife&s;t this famous Teacher among our Sectaries, not only &s;uppo&s;ed the Ver&s;ion of the &s;eventy and our Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion to be the &s;ame; but moreover that the Authors of it &s;tood well nigh upon a Level, in point of Divine direction &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;tance with the Che|tubim or Hagiographi of the Scriptures in the Originals: Which could he have Con|vinced us of, no doubt would have wrought us to a compliance with his propo&s;al. But we gave him to under&s;tand, that 'twas what we had never heard before, &amp; very much doubted the Truth of; and farther, that our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation, tho' a worthy perfor|mance,
<PB N="5" REF="003142_0006_0FF01096583FDAF0">yet was not Perfect, but capable of Amendment in many places; and that tho' we had no rea&s;on to Boa&s;t of our Acquain|tance with the Hebrew &amp; Greek Languages, their various Idioms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet &s;ince the know|ledge we had of them did a&s;&s;ure us of this, we could not &s;ee our&s;elves obliged to comply with what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Propo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</P>
<P>The Second thing they in&s;i&s;ted upon was, That no Argument &s;hould be Propounded <HI>Syllogi&s;tically,</HI> it being they &s;aid, a way of Rea&s;oning they did not under&s;tand, and would be unedifying to the Hearers; and yet, as you will &s;ee by and by, when Mr <HI>Wightman</HI> took the part of an Opponent, he di&s;covered him&s;elf not &s;uch a Stranger to this way of Rea&s;oning as was pretended. But neither was this complied with.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> They moved that after we had offered what we &s;aw cau&s;e on the Affirma|tive part of the &s;everal Que&s;tions, Mr. <HI>Wight|man</HI> might offer on the Negative: which be|ing complyed with, and mutual a&s;&s;urances given throughout the whole Debate to watch again&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion and all other Undecencies, we parted for that Day.</P>
<P>The next Morning accompanied with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> Mr <HI>Mather,</HI> &amp; Mr <HI>Gri&s;|wold,</HI> about T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the Clock, the Hour agreed upon, <HI>we met them at the Meeting hou&s;e in Lyme,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003142_0007_0FF01098CF5D3658">where a con&s;iderable Number of People were waiting, as might be Expected on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion.

<P><HI>Reader,</HI> Thou &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Debate now was about the meaning of this word [Di&s;ciples] Acts 15.10.&mdash; whether it intend only &s;uch Gentile Believers as were Adult, or of Years, or their Seed together with them; and that the whole matter in Controver&s;y was determined by the Re&s;olution of this.

But then when any Per&s;ons did &s;o Believe and Repent and were Baptized, and thereby became Members of the Vi&s;ible Church, the Que&s;tion is, Whe|ther Salvation does not thereupon come to their Hou&s;es or Families, as of old it did when Parents Believed and were Baptized; or in other words, whether they do not here|by bring in their Children with them, and convey a Member&s;hip to them al&s;o; making them thereby vi&s;ibly Heirs of the Promi&s;e &amp; Salvation together with them&s;elves? This I &s;ay, is a Que&s;tion needful to be Re&s;olved by and Per&s;ons thus Employed; and &s;o by You &amp; Us, in order to our knowing what is Duty in the Admini&s;tration of Bapti&s;m. This Que&s;tion I know you re&s;olve in the Negative, and &s;ay; That the Per&s;ons &s;o Believing and Re|penting, do not thereby bring Salvation to their Hou&s;es, or in other words do not bring their Seed or Children into a &s;tate of Vi&s;ible Salvation; but who, I pray, mu&s;t we believe, You or CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles? Do <HI>you</HI> or <HI>They</HI> Preach True Doctrine here? If Per&s;ons &s;o Believing and Repenting do not thus bring in their Children with them, as you &s;ay, then mo&s;t certainly CHRIST mi&s;s'd it when he told <HI>Za<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cheus</HI> on his Faith and Repentance. that <HI>Salvation that very day came

<P>But now if on the other hand, it be true, that CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles are in the right in what they tell us in tho&s;e Texts, the unavoidable Con&s;equence of it will be, that the Infants of Vi&s;ible Believers are to be Baptized.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That though it be true there were diver&s;e Pools in the City, yet that the A|po&s;tles and this Multitude were now met at or nuar to any one, or more of them, or if they were, that they had free Acce&s;s to them on this occa&s;ion are things which I Conjecture will want proof for &s;ome time, and which

For evidence of which what I offered was of the Tenor of what is before cited from Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> p.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Propo&s;itions I offered as accounting for the Rea&s;ons why we Bap|tized by the Application of Water to the Subject, and held it lawful for us to do &s;o; and having done &s;o, Summ'd them up into the following Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI> Seeing it is as we have heard, that the Word of GOD our only guide in all Admini&s;trations hath left the Admini&s;tration of this Ordinance of Bapti&s;m under &s;uch a Latitude; in particu|lar, &s;ince the word <HI>[Baptizo]</HI> &s;ignifies as well to wa&s;h by Sprinkling or pouring on of Water, as by Dipping into it; &s;ince none of the Scriptures alledged to prove that Dip|ping was the Primitive way of Baptizing, do nece&s;&s;arily Infer or Prove it; &s;ince there are other Scriptures which when con&s;i|dered and weighed with all attending cir|cum&s;tances, look quite another way, render it difficult and next to impo&s;&s;ible to think that Dipping was, at lea&s;t always, the Pri|mitive way of Baptizing; &s;ince Bapti&s;m is a Vi&s;ible Sign and Seal of an Invi&s;ible Grace, the E&s;&s;ence of which don't depend on the
<PB N="89" REF="003142_0090_0FF01165D27572D8">quantity of Water u&s;ed in it; &s;ince GOD by any po&s;itive Law has not determined the mode of Baptizing.</P>
<P><HI>And Finally,</HI> Since its unrea&s;onable to think that CHRIST &s;hould Ordain an Or|dinance which can't univer&s;ally and at all times be attended by Per&s;ons, without &s;uch Incoveniences and Perils as above; the&s;e things being &s;o, it mu&s;t needs be lawful to Baptize by applying or pouring Water on the Subject of it, and we are Ju&s;tifiable in &s;o Admini&s;tring of it. But the Antecedent is true: Therefore &s;o al&s;o is the Con&s;equence. This is what I offered in proof of the Second Article; nor do I remember any thing ma|terial &s;aid in an&s;wer to it, more than I have already accounted for. And now again it came to Mr. <HI>Wightman</HI>'s turn to act the part of an Opponent, and offer on the Negative part of the Que&s;tion, which accordingly he did, and in doing of it, let us know he was not &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Stranger to Syllogi&s;ms as before was pretended.</P>

<P><Q>This from him that is willing to &s;erve you in the Truth, <HI>Valentine Wightman.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This I think is his Letter Verbatim with|out mi&s;take of a word. He &s;ays the fir&s;t Four of the Arguments above were offered by him at the Di&s;pute, I remember but Two, and they not as here written, as he him&s;elf intimates; however &s;ince its po&s;&s;ible I may be mi&s;taken, I'll not in&s;i&s;t on that. What I would &s;ay here, is, That as I am I hope &s;in|cerely de&s;irous, and &s;hould heartily rejoice if Mr. <HI>Wightman,</HI> or any others of his Way or Denomination might receive any benefit by what is now written, &s;o its my re&s;olution as far as may be to avoid every thing tending to Prejudice or Hinder it; for which rea&s;on, though it were ea&s;y for me to make both my &s;elf and others Merry with &s;ome remarks
<PB N="96" REF="003142_0097_0FF011771AAA0CC0">on the Arguments above, yet I will not do it le&s;t I &s;hould offend tho&s;e, whom I &s;hould rejoice to Gain. For this rea&s;on I &s;ay, (as al&s;o becau&s;e I think there is not any thing in them with an An&s;wer to which the fore|going Di&s;cour&s;e does not furni&s;h the Reader) I'll wave any thing of that Nature, and in|&s;tead of it annex &s;ome further thoughts on this matter, by which Mr. <HI>Wightman</HI> and his Brethren may &s;ee there is more rea&s;on to doubt of Dipping, its being the Primitive way of Baptizing, than perhaps now they do, &amp; at the &s;ame time be convinc'd that what|ever it was, yet that the Po&s;ition laid down by us in this matter (as we &s;uppo&s;e prov'd) at the Debate, is an Undoubted Truth, and we therefore Ju&s;tifiable in Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject.</P>
<P>And for this end I'll endeavour to make good the&s;e Two Propo&s;itions. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That a good account may be given why John the Bapti&s;t Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made u&s;e of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge tho&s;e they Baptized.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That &s;uppo&s;ing the utmo&s;t that can be de&s;ired by any in this ca&s;e,</HI> viz. <HI>That John the Bapti&s;t, the Apostles, Philip, and the other E|vangeli&s;ts
<PB N="97" REF="003142_0098_0FF0117A1230E410">did Immer&s;e or Dipp tho&s;e they Bap|tized, or that Dipping was really the Primitive Mode of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that others are oblig'd to Baptize in the &s;ame manner al&s;o, &amp; by Con&s;equence that our way of Baptizing by Sprinkling or Pouring on of Water, is Sinful; yea that it will be &s;o far from it, that notwith|&s;tanding, it may be Sinful in others to Immer&s;e or Dipp tho&s;e they Baptize.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If the&s;e Two Propo&s;itions can be made e|vident, I think, that as our Adver&s;aries in this matter will have rea&s;on to abate of their Confidence re&s;pecting the Primitive way of Baptizing, <HI>viz</HI> That it was by Dipping or Plunging; and to be more &s;paring in their Invectives again&s;t us, for not complying with it; &s;o at the &s;ame time to &s;ee how Inexcu&s;a|ble they are in making this one Ground or Rea&s;on of their &s;eparating from us. I'll therefore make an E&s;&s;ay here, and &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That a good account may be given why John the Bapti&s;t Baptized in Jordan and Enon, and Philip made u&s;e of the Water of a Fountain, Brook or River in Baptizing the Eunuch, altho' they did not Dipp or Plunge tho&s;e they Baptized.</HI></P>
<P>This Opinion of our Adver&s;aries, <HI>viz.</HI> That Dipping was the Primitive way of Baptizing, takes ri&s;e as I conceive principally from the Hi&s;tory we have of the Places of the Bapti&s;ms
<PB N="98" REF="003142_0099_0FF0125F2C8D0398">of tho&s;e Two Primitive Mini&s;ters; of the former his Baptizing in <HI>Jordan</HI> and <HI>Enon,</HI> the latter his making u&s;e of the Water of a <HI>Fountain, Brook</HI> or <HI>River</HI> in Baptizing the Eunuch. Not &s;o much from the Phra&s;e (of <HI>going down into</HI> &amp; <HI>coming up out of</HI> the Water) made u&s;e of in tho&s;e Hi&s;tories, which have been before taken notice of, and their in|&s;ufficiency to prove what they would from them &s;hewed; this Opinion of theirs I &s;ay, does not &s;o much take Ri&s;e from the&s;e, as from the con&s;ideration of the Places (<HI>Jordan</HI> and <HI>Enon</HI>) where they Baptized, there be|ing much Water there. And this they think is a good evidence of the Truth of it, in-as-much as if it be &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> did not Dipp tho&s;e they Baptized, no man, they &s;ay, can excogitate or a&s;&s;ign any good rea&s;on why they Baptized in &s;uch places, rather than others where there was not &s;uch plenty of Water: To which, I &s;ay, that if other rea&s;ons can be given of this, &s;uch as will well account for, or ju&s;tify their doing &s;o, though it be &s;uppo&s;ed they did not Dip tho&s;e they Baptized there, the Inevita|ble Con&s;equence of this will be, that this Opinion or theirs &s;tands upon a very Feeble Ba&s;is, &s;uch as will &s;carcely bear them out in their Confidence in it. Now this is what I would here give &s;ome evidence of, and this
<PB N="99" REF="003142_0100_0FEFD871CD7DD3B0">I will do from &s;everal Propo&s;itions of Un|que&s;tionable Truth or Certainty, and which, altho', &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, may at fir&s;t view, &s;eem remote from my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, yet will appear otherwi&s;e when I come to apply or make my de&s;igned u&s;e of them.</P>

<P N="3">3 <HI>P.</HI> We are not to con&s;ider <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> as having the Countenance or Appro|bation of the leading, governing part of the Nation of the Jews in his Mini&s;try, <HI>i. e.</HI> in his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing,</HI> no nor of the main Body of the People, unle&s;s it was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his fir&s;t &s;etting out therein.

<PB N="101" REF="003142_0102_0FF0117E1E06EF78">Multitude was not of long continuance, but &s;o &s;oon declined that (tho' the whole time of his Mini&s;try was very &s;hort; &s;carce ex|ceeding a Year and half,) we find him not toward the clo&s;e of it, attended or followed with &s;uch Multitudes, as in his beginning. And to this our Saviour no doubt has re|ference, when in his Di&s;cour&s;e with the Jews, &s;peaking of John, he &s;ays of him, Joh 5.35. <HI>He was a Burning and a Shining Light, and ye were willing for a Sea&s;on to rejoice in his Light, Q.

Not that there were none that re|tained an Honour for him even to the la&s;t; the Hi&s;tory we have of him a&s;&s;ures us of the contrary, <HI>viz</HI> That there were many who did &s;o; but the number was &s;mall compared with what it was in his beginning or fir&s;t entrance on his Mini&s;try. But as for the leading, governing part of the People, there was no time of his Mini&s;try in which he had their countenance or favour, as is variou&s;ly evident. In the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> that grand Coun|cil of the Nation, as well as in their le&s;&s;er Councils, there were many of the Phari&s;ees, who every one knows were a Set of Men mo&s;t Zealous <HI>for</HI> and Tenacious <HI>of</HI> the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rites,</HI> and would allow nothing to be added in Divine Wor&s;hip to what they had received concerning it, either from the Law of GOD, or the Tradition of the Elders.

<PB N="103" REF="003142_0104_0FF01184CE2FE5A0">Introduce Innovations in Religion, and in|a&s;-much as they could not but &s;ee this to be the Tendency of John's Preaching and Bap|ti&s;m, it could not be but that they were no &s;ooner appriz'd of it, than they look'd up|on him with a Jealous eye. According to this we find that forthwith upon this they &s;ent Prie&s;ts and Levites from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Bethabara,</HI> where he was in the exerci&s;e of his Mini&s;try, to enquire of him, who he was, and by what Authority he Preach'd and Baptiz'd? See <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.19, <HI>to</HI> 25. Hereby letting us know that they had no Favour for him, that they look'd upon him as a Dan|gerous Per&s;on, one who if he were &s;uffered to proceed, as he had begun, it might be of ill Con&s;equence. And for further Confir|mation of this Propo&s;ition, there are Two things Obvious in the Hi&s;tory we have of the Bapti&s;t, which I would here take notice of, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) His Wilderne&s;s Life. The Story we have of him a&s;&s;ures us not only that the more Private part of his Life, which continu'd till he was about Thirty Years of Age, was &s;pent in the Wilderne&s;s, <HI>i. e.</HI> in places Re|mote and but thinly Inhabited; but al&s;o that his Publick Life, or that part of his Time which &s;ucceeded his Entrance upon his Of|fice was &s;o too. I remember not that in that
<PB N="104" REF="003142_0105_0FF011870E843790">part of his Hi&s;tory that relates to us this part of his Life, we find him any where but at <HI>Jordan, Bethabara</HI> and <HI>Enon</HI> and <HI>Parts Ad|jacent;</HI> all of them Places remote and not &s;o &s;tor'd with Inhabitants as many other parts of the Land. According to which he is &s;aid, Mat. 3 1. <HI>To come Preaching in the Wilderne&s;s of Judea;</HI> and is &s;tiled by the Prophet I&s;a. Chap 40.3 <HI>The Voice of one crying in the Wil|derne&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> Otherwi&s;e it was with CHRIST, who &s;hunn'd no places of greate&s;t Re&s;ort; oft Preach'd in the Temple &amp; Synagogues of the Jews, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And whereas <HI>Chemnitius</HI> thinks the Bapti&s;t cho&s;e thus to fulfil his Mini&s;try in the Wilderne&s;s, rather than in the Temple and other places of Re&s;ort, to make an illu&s;trious difference between him|&s;elf and his LORD; of whom it was Pro|phe&s;ied, Mal. 3.1. <HI>The Lord whom ye &s;eek, &s;hall &s;uddenly come to his holy temple.</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, that to me it &s;eems far more rea&s;onable to think, it was for the Rea&s;on hinted above, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e he knew how he was e&s;teemed or look'd upon by the Leading, Governing part of the Nation, as well as the main Body of the People (at lea&s;t in the clo&s;e of his Mini&s;try) that they look'd upon him with an evil Eye, as a dangerous Per&s;on, one who it &s;uffered to proceed, might bring on Changes they de&s;ired not; to prevent which there was
<PB N="105" REF="003142_0106_0FF01189C3CEA7B8">danger le&s;t they &s;hould Apprehend and Con|fine him, if not inflict greater Evils on him.</P>
<P N="2">(2) It gives us no account of &s;uch Num|bers re&s;orting to him in the latter part of the time of his Mini&s;try, as in the beginning of it. This will be evident to every one that con&s;iders the Order of things related by the Evangeli&s;ts as done by him in the cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try. With relation to which I &s;ay, That as in the Story we have of him, we never find him any where, during that time but at <HI>Jordan</HI> &amp; <HI>Places adjacent,</HI> viz. <HI>Bethabara</HI> &amp; <HI>Enon,</HI> (which were near to it; the one on the Ea&s;t, the other on the We&s;t|&s;ide of it) So what it accounts for as done by him, it relates as done in one or other of tho&s;e Places; And further, That he that attentively Reads it, will &s;e that he di&s;char|ged his Mini&s;try in tho&s;e places in this order, <HI>viz.</HI> fir&s;t at <HI>Jordan,</HI> then at <HI>Bethabara,</HI> and la&s;t at <HI>Enon.</HI> I need not enlarge here to E|vidence this, it being what every one that attentively Reads that part of the Sacred Hi&s;tory will &s;ee. Now we have in it no ac|count of &s;uch Multitudes re&s;orting to him when at <HI>Bethabara</HI> &amp; <HI>Enon</HI> as when at <HI>Jordan.</HI> With re&s;pect to this la&s;t, the Story &s;ays, <HI>Then went out to him Jeru&s;alem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were Bap|tized of him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> great Numbers of all

But with re&s;pect to his Baptizing at <HI>Bethabara,</HI> it only informs us of the Conference he had with the Prie&s;ts and Levites &s;ent from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> by the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to Enquire of him who he was, &amp; by what Authority he Baptized; Adding for a clo&s;e, <HI>The&s;e things were done in Bethabara beyond Jor|dan, where John was Baptizing;</HI> without a word accounting for the Number that re&s;orted to him there. In like manner, with re&s;pect to his Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">izing in <HI>Enon,</HI> it only tells us there were &s;ome that came and were Baptized of him. Now, tho' its not to be doubted, there were many who came to and were Baptized of him in tho&s;e Places, &s;ince its manife&s;t he was in great E&s;teem with many, even to the time of his Death, yet in as much as the Hi|&s;tory is &s;ilent here, makes no mention of &s;uch Numbers re&s;orting to him when at tho&s;e Places as when at <HI>Jordan,</HI> 'tis rea&s;onable to think they were Comparatively few: which if it was &s;o, its no doubt to be Re&s;olved into this as the Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> The Bapti&s;ts &s;ink|ing, declining Reputation among the com|mon &s;ort of People.

<P N="2">2. As for <HI>Philip</HI> his Baptizing the Eunuch in or at a Fountain, Brook or River the foregoing account of the Condition of the place where he met him on the road and Baptized him, will al&s;o well account for it, tho' we don's &s;uppo&s;e he Dipp'd or Plung'd him; inasmuch as from thence its rational enough to think that be&s;ides that Fountain, Brook or River, there might not be a Drop of Water within many Miles of them. This I &s;ay, by all account of the place is rea&s;ona|ble to think, and if &s;o, he mu&s;t either make u&s;e of that or not Baptize him at all, unle&s;s he had Travell'd with him (perhaps) many Miles further. Had <HI>Philip</HI> met the Eun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch in &s;ome Town or Village where Water &s;u&s;|ficient to Sprinkle or Wa&s;h him, might have been had from Wells or Pits they had made
<PB N="115" REF="003142_0116_0FF011A1534B8788">for their u&s;e, and had gone with him from thence to &s;ome Fountain, Brook or River, there had then been good rea&s;on to conclude he Plung'd or Dipp'd him; and there would then be &s;ome &s;trength in the Con&s;equence, if from their doing &s;o his Plunging him were inferred or argued. But we find not a Word of this in the Story, but quite the con|trary, <HI>viz</HI> That it was in the Wilderne&s;s that he met him. The Angel &s;ays to Philip, Ner. 26. <HI>Ari&s;e and go toward the South, unto the way that goeth down from Jeru&s;alem to Gaza, which is De&s;ert,</HI> i. e. which <HI>way</HI> is a De&s;ert; as <HI>Whitby</HI> renders it exactly according to the Greek. Here, in this Dry &amp; Thir&s;ty Wil|derne&s;s, where a man may Travel many Miles (yea, may I not &s;ay Scores of Miles?) and not &s;ee a Drop of Water, it was that <HI>Philip</HI> Met and Baptized him, from whence 'tis evident he was obliged to make u&s;e of this Water they came to as they were Tra|velling on the Road, or not Baptize him at all, unle&s;s (as I &s;aid but now) he had Tra|velled with him, perhaps, many Miles fur|ther. And whereas Mr. <HI>Hitchcock</HI> at that time of the Debate, as I before ob&s;erved, &s;aid on this In&s;tance, <Q>If Philip did not Dipp the Eunuch, why was it that he was obliged to come forth of his Chariot and go down with <HI>Philip</HI> to the Water? What,
<PB N="116" REF="003142_0117_0FF011A2E2A3D410">had not &s;o great an Officer of Queen <HI>Can|dace</HI> as this Eunuch was, any Di&s;h or Ve&s;|&s;el in his Chariot in which a little Water &s;ufficient for Sprinkling or Wa&s;hing him might have been fetch'd?</Q> To this I &s;ay, that as <HI>ver.</HI> 36. a&s;&s;ures us that they came in their way even to or upon this very Water (<HI>Epi to Huder</HI> the Orignal is,) before the Eunuch mov'd to Philip to Baptize him, and cau&s;ed his Chariot to &s;tand &s;till, &s;o every one will &s;ay the Room of his Chariot was a place no ways convenient or proper to Ad|mini&s;ter the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m in, un|le&s;s Chariots in that Day were very different from what they are now; and that they were better I think there is little rea&s;on to be|lieve. 'Tis not therefore &s;trange he came forth of his Chariot, as great a man as he was, to be Sprinkl'd or Wa&s;h'd with the Water, tho' he be &s;uppo&s;ed to have never &s;o many Attendants, and a Score of Golden Bowls with him. And now to conclude this matter, From the&s;e things it appears to me, that <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> had Wi&s;e and Good rea&s;ons for Baptizing in the Places mentioned, where there were &s;uch large Collections of Water, even tho' they did but Sprinkle or Wa&s;h tho&s;e they Baptized; and it being &s;o, how Feeble the Argument or our Adver&s;aries mu&s;t be, when from their
<PB N="117" REF="003142_0118_0FF011A57696DE68">Baptizing in tho&s;e places they infer that they Dipp'd tho&s;e they Baptized, is what I hope there are none but will &s;ee. And this may &s;uffice for the Fir&s;t Propo&s;ition. The Second is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;uppo&s;ing the utmo&s;t that can be de|&s;ired by any in this matter,</HI> viz. <HI>That John the Bapti&s;t, the Apo&s;tles, Philip, and other Primitiva Mini&s;ters, did Immer&s;e tho&s;e they Baptized; or that Dipping was really the Primitive way of Baptizing, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the &s;ame manner al&s;o, and by Con&s;equence that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject is Sinful, yea it will be &s;o for from it, that notwwith&s;tanding it may be Sinful in others to Immer&s;e or Dipp tho&s;e they Baptize.</HI></P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition contains a Two-fold A&s;|&s;ertion, Viz.</P>
<P N="1">[1] <HI>That &s;uppo&s;ing Dipping was the way in which John the Bapti&s;t, the Apo&s;tles, Philip,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are obliged to Baptize in the &s;ame manner, and Con&s;equently that our way of Baptizing by the Application of Water to the Subject, is Sinful.</HI> This I think will be evident to every one that will weigh the following particulars,</P>
<P N="1">(1) That the Examples even of the Ho|lie&s;t and Be&s;t Men in any ca&s;e or in&s;tance, are not &s;imply or in them&s;elves binding to
<PB N="118" REF="003142_0119_0FF011A71CB08F08">others. Its true, its our Duty and we are bound in many things to trace the &s;teps of the Wi&s;e and Holy, and its our Sin when we do not; But why is it &s;o? Why not meerly becau&s;e they did tho&s;e things where|in we are bound to follow them, but either becau&s;e there are moral rea&s;ons in the things them&s;elves, or becau&s;e there is &s;ome expre&s;s, po&s;itive Command of GOD &s;uper-added to the example. And in the&s;e ca&s;es only it is that an Obligation lies on us to be follow|ers of them. If the example of any Man, John the Bapti&s;t, Philip or any other, as &s;uch, be binding, I would gladly know in what ca&s;es or In&s;tances it is &s;o, whether in &s;ome things only done by them, or in all? I'm ready to think Mr. <HI>Wightman</HI> and his Brethren will not &s;ay the la&s;t, or that its binding in all they did; inasmuch as this would be a dangerous Doctrine indeed, one inevitable Con&s;equence of is being this, viz. That they, and I, and many others, are ob|liged to imitate John in his manner of Li|ving, taking up our abode in the Wilderne&s;s, clothing our &s;elves with Camels Hair, and wearing a Leathern Girdle about our Loyns, and Eating Locu&s;ts and wild Honey, as he did. But this I &s;u&s;pect <HI>they</HI> would not like very well, I am &s;ure <HI>I</HI> &s;hould not; and I be|lieve any Man will find it a difficult Task
<PB N="119" REF="003142_0120_0FF011A95D725C50">to per&s;wade them they are bound by the Example of John in the&s;e points. Well, if we are not obliged by it in the&s;e In&s;tances, in what are we? You &s;ay in the In&s;tance of his Baptizing, otherwi&s;e there is no force in vour Argument, when from his Dipping in Bapti&s;m, as you &s;uppo&s;e, you infer an Obligation on us to do &s;o too. But pray give me a rea&s;on for this, <HI>viz.</HI> Why it &s;hould oblige us in this ca&s;e or In&s;tance, and not in the fore-mentioned. When I was at the School <HI>A Quatenus ad Omne, valet Con&s;equentia,</HI> (which you may Engli&s;h thus if you plea&s;e, <HI>viz</HI> If the Example of any Man as &s;uch, oblige in one in&s;tance, it does in all;) was received for a Maxim or Rule of Everla&s;ting Truth; and that it is &s;o, I firmly believe &s;till. And if it be &s;o, then our Obligation from John's example, con&s;idered as &s;uch, to dwell in the Wilderne&s;s, array our &s;elves with Camels Hair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is as great and &s;trong, as to Baptize by Dipping; for as I &s;aid, if his Example as &s;uch, bind us in any one ca&s;e or in&s;tance, it mu&s;t in all. But its needle&s;s for me to enlarge here, &s;ince what I now a&s;|&s;ert is no more than what I pre&s;ume Mr. <HI>Wightman,</HI> (or at lea&s;t &s;uch of his Brethren, as pa&s;s under the Denomination of Seventh Day Bapti&s;ts) will allow or grant. Their &s;tanding practice in not ob&s;erving or Sancti|fying
<PB N="120" REF="003142_0121_0FF011AD15FE2080">the Fir&s;t Day of the Week, but the Seventh, gives me, I think, ju&s;t rea&s;on &s;o to pre&s;ume; &s;ince if they tho't Examples of Holy men, as &s;uch binding, how they can hold them&s;elves excu&s;able in not Sanctifying that Day, for the Sanctification of which, the Apo&s;tles and Primitive Chri&s;tians have &s;et us an Example, is hard for me to &s;ee. This particular at once Ca&s;hiers Four of Mr. <HI>Wightmans</HI> Arguments; and I can't but hope he will now &s;ee, that for him or any other Per&s;on to attempt to prove the Unlawfulne&s;s of Sprinkling or Wa&s;hing in Bapti&s;m, from the Example of John, Philip or any other, (&s;uppo&s;ing it were evident they Dipp'd tho&s;e they Baptized) is Vain and Ab&s;urd; &s;ince whatever they did in this matter Sim|ply in it &s;elf, can't infer any Obligation on us to do in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;ing they Dipp'd in Baptizing, yet as there are no moral rea&s;ons in the Nature of the thing obliging others to do &s;o too, &s;o neither is there any po&s;itive Law obliging us to follow them in it, or deter|mining that mode of Bapti&s;m. There are two Ca&s;es, as I Intimated above, wherein Ex|amples are binding, or Rather wherein we are bound to follow them, <HI>viz.</HI> When there are Moral Rea&s;ons in the nature of the things done, and when any expre&s;s, po&s;itive Law
<PB N="121" REF="003142_0122_0FF011AF13DE5D60">of God is &s;uper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">added determining them and Requiring in others an Imitation of them. But now neither of the&s;e things can be pre|tended in this matter of which I'm now &s;peaking. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) There can be no Moral Rea&s;ons in that mode of Bapti&s;m obliging us to it, but on the other hand I think its manife&s;t from what I have cited above from Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> there are Moral Rea&s;ons obliging us to Swerve or Deviate from it. If it be true that the Sixth and Seventh Commands of the Moral Law, are Moral, and Baptizing by Dipping be, as he &s;ays, a Breach of tho&s;e Commands, then &s;urely there mu&s;t be Moral Rea&s;ons in the Nature of the thing thus obliging us.</P>
<P N="2">(2) There is no expre&s;s po&s;itive Law Ob|liging us to follow them in it; or Deter|mining that mode of Bapti&s;m. If Mr. <HI>Wight|man</HI> or any of his Denomination know of any, I'le thank them if they'll let me do &s;o too, and in&s;tantly come over to them, at lea&s;t, in this point. All that I know can be &s;aid here, is, that <HI>John's</HI> Bapti&s;m was from Heaven, as our Saviour imply's in that Que&s;|tion he propounded to the Chief Prie&s;ts and Elders of the Jews. <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.25.&mdash;And if &s;o, then &s;o was the mode of it too: If there|fore he Baptized by Dipping, this will infer
<PB N="122" REF="003142_0123_0FF011B159A07490">a po&s;itive Law, &s;ome may think, determin|ing that mode of it. But I deny the Con|&s;equence here, and &s;ay that tho' it be &s;up|po&s;ed he Dipp'd in Baptizing, his Bapti&s;m may well enough be &s;aid to be from Heaven, and yet that mode of it not be &s;o, &s;ince the modes of things are not of their E&s;&s;ence. I know very well Mr <HI>Wightman</HI> &amp; his Brethren &s;ay this mode, <HI>viz.</HI> Dipping, is of the E&s;&s;ence of Bapti&s;m, and that Bapti&s;m in any other way is no Bapti&s;m. But be&s;ides that herein they &s;eem not to me well to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween Entities &amp; their Modes: Be&s;ides this I &s;ay, I'm at a lo&s;s how they will prove it, any po&s;itive Law determining this mode of it I'm &s;ure there is none, nor can it I think be done from the import or meaning of the word in the Original: &s;ince (whatever it is, yet) we find it oft u&s;ed there by the Spirit of God to &s;ignify Sprinkling or Wa&s;hing by pouring on or applying water to things, as well as dipping them. But enough of this, and more I think I need not add to make out this fir&s;t Particular, which is <HI>That Sup|po&s;ing Dipping was the way in which John the Bapti&s;t, the Apo&s;tles, Philip</HI> &amp;c. <HI>did Baptize, yet this will not prove that all others are Obliged to Baptize in the &s;ame manner.</HI> The Second is,</P>
<P N="2">[2] <HI>That tho' this he Suppo&s;ed. yet it will be &s;o far from inferring &s;uch an Obligation lying on
<PB N="123" REF="003142_0124_0FF011B476F06C30">others, that not with&s;tanding it may be &s;inful in them to Immer&s;e or Dip tho&s;e they Baptize.</HI> This will be readily allowed for a Truth by all tho&s;e that know that many ca&s;es may be &s;uppo&s;ed, wherein there may be Moral Rea|&s;ons obliging Per&s;ons to Swerve or Deviate from the Example of Holy men, in things wherein at other times and in other Cir|cum&s;tances it were not only warrantable for them, but their duty to imitate or follow them. And this all tho&s;e mu&s;t know that are not &s;o near to perfect Ideoti&s;m, as not to know that as <HI>hic &amp; nunc</HI> i.e. <HI>time and place</HI> are Circum&s;tances in&s;eparable from all Acti|ons, &s;o that the Expediency or Inexpediency, and Con&s;equently the Lawfulne&s;s or Unlaw|fulne&s;s of them has a great dependance on tho&s;e Circum&s;tances.

<P><HI>That if Lawful Authority have Right or Power to Determine the &V;ndetermined Modes of Moral Duties, then the pre&s;ent way of the Country in Maintaining Ministers by a Publick Rate or Tax is Lawful.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Therefore the pre&s;ent way of the Country in Maintaining Mini&s;ters by a Publick Rate or Tax is Lawful.</HI></P>
<P>To which I added, That the Support of Mini&s;ters by a Publick Rate or Tax, was one Mode or Manner (among diver&s;e others) of Sub&s;i&s;ting them, and that the Word of GOD tho' it had plac'd this among the number of Morals in Religion, yet had not Determined the Mode of it, or in what man|ner it &s;hould be done, whether by Publick Rate or Tax, or Weekly Contribution, or any other, only in General, that it &s;hould be done in &s;ome way or other: And that if in &s;uch a ca&s;e where Moral Duties are thus Ciroum&s;tanc'd, Lawful Authority may Rightfully Interpo&s;e and Determine the Mode of them, then the pre&s;ent way of the Country in Supporting Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be Lawful, becau&s;e 'twas what &s;uch Authority had by po&s;itive Law determined.

<P>Much more of the &s;ame &s;train or tenor I might have cited from the Pages above mentioned, but this is enough to &s;atisfy any man how greatly di&s;&s;erviceable to Religion the&s;e men have been in other parts of the World, what dreadful effects have attended

<P>Nor can this &s;eem at all incredible to any one that takes a view of the Condition of Religion in &s;uch places of this Land, as in which this Sect (or Sects) have obtained, and have not been favoured with better helps to further that Intere&s;t in them When Mr. <HI>Wheelright,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> before men|tioned, and others of their way that fir&s;t &s;owed the Tares of Antinomiani&s;m &amp; Fami|li&s;m in <HI>New-England,</HI> were for their Sedition and Bla&s;phemies Bani&s;hed the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> they (or at lea&s;t many of them) went into the Neighbouring Go|vernment of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land;</HI> where they and &s;ome who in Succe&s;&s;ion have imbibed their Errors, have ever &s;ince been almo&s;t the only helps (if I may call them &s;o) that mi&s;erable People have had to help forward among them the great intere&s;t of Religion, till of late Years: And who viewing the Condition of it among them, can think the&s;e men have been of any &s;ervice to it? Yea who can think otherwi&s;e than that they have been very Prejudicial to it, have been &s;o far from help|ing men forward in the Po&s;itives of Reli|gion, that they have even almo&s;t utterly
<PB N="184" REF="003142_0185_0FF0124AF7F3AB60">Ras'd out the very Naturals of it. For cer|tainly that People (at lea&s;t the mo&s;t of tho&s;e I have had opportunity to ob&s;erve) had been far better, had had much more of Reli|gion than they have, had they been left purely to the dim light of Nature, without any further advantage or help.

<P>And if we look into any other Places where the&s;e men have made entrance and gained Parties to them&s;elves, what can we find that may give us rea&s;on to hope they have &s;erved the Intere&s;t of Religion in any one Soul?

For my own part among all tho&s;e of them I now do, or ever did know, I never knew one concerning whom there was rea&s;on thus
