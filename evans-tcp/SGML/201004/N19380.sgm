<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has attentively con&s;idered the &s;eries of que&s;tions propo&s;ed for public di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion by the Teylerian Society, will acknow|ledge that they have u&s;ually had the peculiar ad|vantage of uniting curious inve&s;tigation with ge|neral utility. But, of all the que&s;tions propo&s;ed by this, or by any literary &s;ociety whatever, none appears either of greater con&s;equence in it&s;elf, or from the complexion of the times, more likely to excite attention, than that which is now offered by this re&s;pectable body, as the &s;ubject of compe|tition for the literary honour which they annually confer. It directly leads to examine the princi|pal foundations of civil &s;ociety, to unfold the chief obligations of all &s;ocial duties, to e&s;tabli&s;h the important advantages of &s;ubordination, on the one hand, and, on the other, to guard again&s;t the dreadful and odious con&s;equences both of de&s;|poti&s;m and of anarchy. Such are the momentous con&s;iderations nece&s;&s;arily connected with the pro|per di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion; the propo&s;al of
<PB N="iv" REF="025234_0003_0FCC92AA2A3ADA20">
which does equal honour to the di&s;cernment and public &s;pirit of the worthy directors of the Tey|lerian in&s;titution. Happy may the per&s;on account him&s;elf, and ju&s;tly will he be entitled to the thanks of his fellow men, who &s;hall be enabled to treat this &s;ubject in any manner adequate to its real con&s;equence and dignity. Far, indeed, is the writer of this E&s;&s;ay from pre&s;uming to lay claim to this prai&s;e, but he feels his heart impre&s;&s;ed by the importance of the &s;ubject, and animated with a warm de&s;ire of contributing to the public good that portion which his &s;mall abilities may permit. Ever &s;ince he was capable of any rational reflec|tion, he has found his &s;oul actuated by the &s;acred flame of Liberty, by an abhorrence of oppre&s;&s;ion, and by that love of ju&s;tice which dictates an equal enjoyment of all the rights of human nature. The grand principle of the natural equality of men, if rightly under&s;tood, is the only ba&s;is on which univer&s;al ju&s;tice, order, and freedom, can be firmly built, and permanently &s;ecured. The view exhibited in this E&s;&s;ay, &s;o far from loo&s;ening the bands of &s;ociety, or weakening that &s;ubordi|nation, without which no government can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, will draw more clo&s;ely every &s;ocial tie, and more &s;trongly confirm the obligations of legal obedi|ence, and the rights of legal authority.</P>
<P>The writer is &s;ufficiently aware that the prin|ciples
<PB N="v" REF="025234_0004_0FCCAE0EAB74D508">
which he attempts to unfold, will not be a|greeable either to the wild enthu&s;ia&s;ts for liberty, or to the &s;ervile and tyrannical abettors of arbi|trary power. That moderation, which flows from the love and the perception of truth (which commonly lies between two extremes) is &s;eldom acceptable to the multitude, who, incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the u&s;e from the abu&s;e of things, are generally as extravagant and impetuous in the maintenance of right, as in the abetment of wrong. It is only the few, who have &s;haken off the &s;hackles of prejudice, di&s;pelled the clouds of pa&s;&s;ion, and bur&s;t from the dungeon in which they confine the &s;oul, that can view and reli&s;h ob|jects as they appear in the pure and &s;teady light in which nature exhibits them. The eyes of the re&s;t of mankind are either too weak to &s;u&s;tain its lu&s;tre, or, if they have beheld it for &s;ome time, become &s;o much dazzled as to lo&s;e &s;ight of the ob|jects which it is de&s;igned to unfold to them, and are thus deprived of that direction in conduct which it ought to afford. Of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, the times in which we live furni&s;h abun|dant and melancholy examples.</P>
<P>Since the generality of mankind, then, will e|ver be in extremes, and the wi&s;er few, if they keep them&s;elves free from the contagion of po|pular
<PB N="vi" REF="025234_0005_0FCCAE1253D11308">
prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion, will, from this very circum&s;tance, &s;eldom acquire any great influence over the general conduct; it may be a&s;ked, of what u&s;e can &s;uch writings be, which the multi|tude will either not read, or not apply to profit, and the more intelligent do not require? To this que&s;tion the an&s;wer is obvious:&mdash;that the progre&s;s of truth is &s;ure, though &s;low; that, if every per|&s;on of di&s;cernment and moderation would con&s;i|der it as his duty to communicate, as far as his &s;phere may extend, the light he him&s;elf has ac|quired, a great deal of good might at la&s;t be ac|compli&s;hed; and that to contribute any portion, however &s;mall, to the common benefit, is both a &s;ufficient motive and a &s;ufficient reward to a bene|volent and generous mind. The human &s;oul is for|med for truth and virtue. Error, prejudice, and de|pravity, are unnatural &s;tates. Super&s;tition and bi|gotry, popular frenzy, or de&s;potic oppre&s;&s;ion, ne|ver can be de&s;tined by the Supreme Director of the world to hold a perpetual reign, becau&s;e they counteract his wi&s;e and benevolent de&s;igns. The pa&s;&s;ions, and the con&s;equent agitations which they excite, as they are violent, can never be la&s;ting, and, from their very violence it&s;elf, tend, by a &s;pecies of fermentation, to throw off the dregs of ignorance and folly, which ob&s;truct the im|provement of our &s;pecies. The&s;e convul&s;ions may
<PB N="vii" REF="025234_0006_0FCCAE135BF74188">
be compared to tempe&s;ts and hurricanes which o|verca&s;t the &s;ky with a temporary gloom, and of|ten occa&s;ion the mo&s;t dreadful calamities; but, in the end, refine the atmo&s;phere, and pre&s;erve its &s;alubrity. It is more natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the progre&s;s of the world is towards improvement and perfection, than, as gloomy but contracted minds are apt to fancy, towards degeneracy and ruin. Even the final de&s;truction of this globe, which Scripture teaches us to expect, will only &s;erve to introduce a more perfect and glorious &s;cene. The times in which we live, though agi|tated with violent convul&s;ions, and marked by &s;triking events, are peculiarly favourable to rati|onal inquiry and to &s;ub&s;tantial improvement. On the public affairs of the world, it has often been &s;aid, that the &s;peculations of philo&s;ophers in their clo&s;ets have but little influen&ccedil;e. But &s;uch an opinion can be adopted by tho&s;e only who are as great &s;trangers to experience as they are to &s;pe|culation. The conduct of men is commonly direc|ted by their opinions. Their opinions are formed by their principles; their principles, by the in|&s;truction which they receive, by the books which they read, by the company which they frequent. Hence it is ea&s;y to &s;ee how far the public opinions and conduct mu&s;t, in a literary age, be affected by the writings that appear in it. If the&s;e are dicta|ted
<PB N="viii" REF="025234_0007_0FCCAE14ADDA1D08">
by &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, and benignity of heart, they cannot fail of producing much bene|fit.</P>
<P>The time, therefore, and pains employed in &s;pe|culations &s;uch as are &s;ugge&s;ted by the important que&s;tion I now propo&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s, cannot be mi&s;|&s;pent, if the &s;ubject is treated with any tolerable degree of accuracy and preci&s;ion. Even tho&s;e who fail of &s;ucce&s;s may &s;till claim the honour of a laudable attempt; and from men of &s;uch judg|ment and candour as characteri&s;e tho&s;e to whom I have the honour of addre&s;&s;ing this di&s;cour&s;e, are &s;ure of obtaining it. Without detaining the at|tention of my candid readers any longer from the immediate con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion now before them, I &s;hall directly proceed to examine it. As it &s;tands propo&s;ed by the Society, it divides it&s;elf into three parts:

<P>THAT all men are, by nature, equal, is an opinion &s;o generally received among tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to any degree of philo&s;ophical re|flection, that to call it in que&s;tion might appear ab&s;urd, and to prove it &s;uperfluous. Yet, this opinion, like many general maxims which obtain a currency in the world, however true it may be, in its proper &s;en&s;e, is not. I am inclined to believe, of the greate&s;t part, &s;ufficiently founded according to the acceptation of tho&s;e who admit it. If it is un|der&s;tood in any &s;en&s;e, exclu&s;ive of all natural &s;upe|riority and di&s;tinction among men, it will be found to contradict univer&s;al experience. At whatever pe|riod
<PB N="12" REF="025234_0010_0FCCAE1ACB523950">
of human life, in whatever &s;tate or condition of &s;ociety, we contemplate our &s;pecies, we &s;hall find that nature has di&s;tingui&s;hed individuals from each other, by peculiar and appropriate qualities, al|mo&s;t as remarkably, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as &s;he has di&s;tingui&s;hed the human race from the inferior creatures. Tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who, in order to exalt them&s;elves, attempt to degrade their &s;pe|cies, and di&s;play their eloquence by defending the mo&s;t irrational paradoxes, are eager to per&s;uade us that, as human nature, in its original &s;tate, is on a level with the brutes, &s;o individuals among mankind derive every difference of corporeal and mental perfection that characterizes them, wholly from the opportunities of improvement which they have enjoyed, or from the happy &s;ituations in which they have been placed. Contradicting univer&s;al experience, they &s;trive to refer the judgments which it e&s;tabli&s;hes, to the cla&s;s of po|pular prejudices; and, pretending to lead us to the true knowledge of human nature, exhibit to our view a &s;tate of bruti&s;h ignorance, and of &s;avage ferocity, which has never exi&s;ted but in their own imaginations. They carry us back to a period of which there are no monuments, and in which they con&s;ider man not as a &s;ocial, but as a &s;olitary animal, actuated by mere animal in&s;tincts, de&s;ti|tute of ideas, a mere quadruped grazing along
<PB N="13" REF="025234_0011_0FCCAE1D8755A7B0">
with the brutes, and as little di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of his &s;pecies by individual qualities, as his &s;pecies from the other inhabitants of the fore&s;t. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h this theory, &s;o di&s;graceful to human nature, they produce certain relations of travellers, concerning Pongos, and Enjokos, and Ourang-Outangs, whom they conclude to be pri|mitive men, who&s;e conduct and mode of life can alone furni&s;h us with ju&s;t repre&s;entations of our original condition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rou&s;&s;eau, &s;ur l'origin et les fondemens de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ga|lite parmi les hommes.

So ea&s;y is it, when a favour|ite opinion is to be maintained, or a paradox e&s;tabli&s;hed, to adopt, as principles, judgments de|&s;titute of all evidence, and to reject principles &s;anctioned by univer&s;al con&s;ent. So apt are the enemies of &s;y&s;tem, to run into &s;y&s;tems of their own, who&s;e &s;ole recommendation is &s;ingularity, while ingenious &s;ophi&s;try is their only &s;upport.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e writers &s;eem not to have reflected, that, if man was originally a brute, he mu&s;t ever have continued &s;o; and that that in&s;tinct, which &s;olely they allow to him in that &s;ituation, if it is unerr|ing
<PB N="14" REF="025234_0012_0FCCAE1E6BCD0340">
within its pre&s;cribed compa&s;s, never can, by any improvement, be carried one &s;tep beyond its primitive limits. That capacity of perfection, which they grant to him, as his only di&s;tinction above the inferior animals, implies, in its very na|ture, more elevated and exten&s;ive powers, than any of the&s;e can po&s;&s;e&s;s. To deny this, is to a&s;|&s;ert, that a building may be erected without a foundation, an elegant and beautiful form exhibit|ed without original materials, an effect produced without a cau&s;e. The&s;e writers &s;eem to overlook the whole analogy of nature, in which every &s;pe|cies is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other, by proper|ties common to all of the &s;ame cla&s;s, while all the individuals of each &s;pecies are characterized by their peculiar qualities. It would be equally ab|&s;urd to think of forming a man out of a brute, as to imagine that a fi&s;h may be transformed into a quadruped.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, however, who &s;eek not fame, but wi&s;|dom, not brilliancy, but truth, will, in all their enquities concerning human nature, take the hu|man &s;pecies, as they find it exhibited, in its various forms, by daily ob&s;ervation, by the incorrupted records of Hi&s;tory, and by the authentic relations of travellers. Beyond the&s;e &s;ources of informa|tion they will not pretend to go in que&s;t of &s;tates
<PB N="15" REF="025234_0013_0FCCAE2005ADCBE0">
of human nature, which are only to be found in the pictures of poets, or in the hypothe&s;es of phi|lo&s;ophers equally fanciful; and they will con&s;ider it as no le&s;s ridiculous for any one to philo&s;ophi&s;e on man with an Ourang-Outang before him, than it would be for a per&s;on, attempting to determine the qualities of gold, to reject an undoubted piece of that metal, and begin his experiments with a piece of pinchbeck. For, as a &s;tatue, however elegantly fini&s;hed, &s;till contains the rude ma&s;s of marble, on which &s;o much &s;ymetry and beauty has been &s;uperinduced; &s;o, man, in the mo&s;t civilized &s;tate of &s;ociety, &s;till retains the original principles of his nature on which all the various modifica|tions he has undergone, have been ingrafted. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the philo&s;opher to di&s;cover the&s;e amid&s;t all the adventitious circum&s;tances with which they may be connected, or the various &s;hapes and colourings which they may have a&s;&s;um|ed. No human pur&s;uit, no human in&s;titution, no human enjoyment, no human corruption it&s;elf, but may be ultimately referred to &s;ome original principle of our nature; and without the&s;e origin|al principles, it is impo&s;&s;ible to account for the power of education, of habit, and of example. If, laying a&s;ide all regard to imaginary &s;tates of human nature, in which none of the principles, which now &s;o powerfully influence our &s;pecies,
<PB N="16" REF="025234_0014_0FCCAE247018F530">
are &s;uppo&s;ed to have unfolded them&s;elves, we fix our attention on mankind as they are exhibited to us in hi&s;tory, and by daily ob&s;ervation, there is one important fact, which mu&s;t occur to every one endowed with the &s;malle&s;t reflection. This fact, on which I mean chiefly to found my rea&s;on|ings on the whole of this &s;ubject, is, that, how|ever &s;imilar the &s;pecies may be in general, an infi|nite diver&s;ity of abilities, talents, and character, obtains among the individuals that compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>This diver&s;ity is evident with regard both to the body, and to the mind. In &s;ome, we behold great bodily &s;trength and dexterity, and a pecu|liar aptitude for mechanical operations, and for rapid and powerful movements. In others, the powers of imagination con&s;picuou&s;ly unfold them|&s;elves; while judgment, acutene&s;s, penetration, and &s;agacity, in the conduct of life, di&s;tingui&s;h another cla&s;s of men. An uncommon clearne&s;s and energy of intellect, and an aptitude for the ab&s;tract &s;ciences, rai&s;e others above the common level. Some have an a&s;toni&s;hing faculty of per&s;ua&s;ion, of addre&s;s, and management in mov|ing the affections, and influencing the conduct of their fellow men.</P>
<P>Nor is this diver&s;ity le&s;s remarkable in the mo|ral qualities of men, than in their corporeal and
<PB N="17" REF="025234_0015_0FCCAE25EB907F10">
intellectual powers. Some have a wonderful command of their own pa&s;&s;ions, and can pre&s;erve their moderation and compo&s;ure of &s;oul amid&s;t the greate&s;t provocations, and the mo&s;t trying cala|mities; others are deprived of all &s;elf government by the &s;lighte&s;t adver&s;ity, or by the &s;malle&s;t oppo|&s;ition. Some natures are extremely &s;ympathetic, and ea&s;ily moved by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their fellow men; while others di&s;cover an a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;en|&s;ibility with regard not only to the afflictions of other per&s;ons, but even to their own. Benevo|lence, and all the gentle and amiable qualities which accompany it, peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome characters, while fortitude and magnanimity, and all the &s;tern and awful virtues, are the leading fea|tures of &s;ome elevated &s;pirits. Not to mention the characteri&s;tical marks of ambition, avarice, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, indolence, or vanity, which diver|&s;ify &s;uch a number of individuals, it is certain that the moral complexion of men is as various as their corporeal con&s;titution, or their mental faculties, and perhaps is greatly influenced by both.</P>
<P>Nor can it be alledged, that the&s;e di&s;tinctions of character are entirely derived from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, and from different opportunities of cultivation; and by no means referable to any original bent of nature. This conclu&s;ion will not
<PB N="18" REF="025234_0016_0FCCAE276AD627F0" MS="y">
be authori&s;ed either by the inductions of rea&s;on, or by experience. For, in the fir&s;t place, it is hard to be conceived how any combination of cir|cum&s;tances, or any influence of education and habit, can produce any power or propen&s;ity, of which the original &s;eeds have not been dropped into the con&s;titution by the hand of the Creator. All that &s;ituation and opportunity can effectuate, is to furni&s;h the&s;e inherent powers and propen&s;i|ties, with the means of unfolding them&s;elves, of increa&s;ing in vigour, and of acquiring maturity. If they are entirely wanting, they will never be implanted by any effort of human &s;kill, or be brought into action, by any favourable combina|tion of circum&s;tances. If they exi&s;t in any degree, however &s;mall, opportunity, exerci&s;e and cultiva|tion, will advance them to a pitch of &s;trength &s;o greatly above their primitive condition, as will have the appearance of a real creation. If we at|tend to the fact it&s;elf, it mu&s;t be evident that children and &s;avages, who have received no in|&s;truction, &s;how varieties of character, as well as men who have enjoyed all the advantages of po|li&s;hed &s;ociety, and who move in its different &s;pheres. Although a pronene&s;s to imitation is univer&s;ally predominant in childhood, yet the manner of imitating, and the objects to which it is directed are infinitely diver&s;ified. As &s;oon as the
<PB N="19" REF="025234_0017_0FCCAE2AB7473EC0">
faculties begin to unfold, all the pa&s;&s;ions and pro|pen&s;ities that belong to human nature impercepti|bly ari&s;e, and, according as the one or the other of the&s;e is mo&s;t prevalent, characteri&s;tical features di&s;tingui&s;h the infant. The objects that engage the attention of the &s;avage, and the de&s;ires that animate his pur&s;uits, are indeed few, in compari|&s;on of tho&s;e that exi&s;t in more poli&s;hed &s;tates of &s;ociety. Yet, as the&s;e concentrate his whole &s;oul, &s;o they excite its energies the more power|fully within their limited compa&s;s, and con&s;pire the more &s;peedily to form his character. In the &s;avage &s;tate, the genuine impul&s;es and propen&s;ities of nature are freely allowed to appear, and, col|lected in one point, exert them&s;elves with the greater vigor, and give to each individual that peculiar complexion which re&s;ults from the pecu|liar &s;trength of his native powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of America, and Raynal's Hi|&s;toire Philo&s;ophique et Politique <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>. The multi|plicity of objects which attract attention, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">i|mulate activity in more poli&s;hed periods of &s;ociety, prevent a character from being &s;o &s;peedily form|ed: while the uniform in&s;titutions of civilized life, mould all the members of the community to mutual re&s;emblance, and contribute to efface tho&s;e prominent and characteri&s;tical features,
<PB N="20" REF="025234_0018_0FCCAE2BEB3D03F8">
which the hand of nature has impre&s;&s;ed. I mean not to a&s;&s;ert that tho&s;e diver&s;ities of talents and character are wholly to be a&s;cribed to the una&s;&s;i&s;t|ed powers of nature, but only that they prevail in the joint proportion of the&s;e powers, and of the circum&s;tances that call them into exerci&s;e. As the fire will &s;oon be extingui&s;hed, if not con&s;tantly fed by combu&s;tibles, and as the&s;e combu&s;tibles, however multiplied, will not produce flame, and light, and heat, unle&s;s they are kindled; &s;o the human faculties, if never called into action by corre&s;ponding &s;ituations, will remain torpid and inefficacious; and the mo&s;t favourable concur|rence of circum&s;tances will not produce genius, dexterity, &s;agacity, and virtue, if the original &s;eeds of all the&s;e qualities are totally wanting. Be this as it may, it is incontrovertible that there is, among the various individuals that compo&s;e the human &s;pecies, an almo&s;t infinite diver&s;ity of abilities, temper, and character.</P>
<P>From this circum&s;tance a natural <HI>inequality</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e. Tho&s;e talents and di&s;po&s;i|tions, which are the mo&s;t amiable and re&s;pectable, directly point out their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors as the objects of love and e&s;teem.

Every di&s;play of genius, of &s;agacity, of penetration, and prudence, is calculated to excite the admiration of the beholders, to afford them plea&s;ure, and if beneficently directed, to demand their gratitude.

I am far from a&s;&s;erting that all power and di&s;tinc|tion are founded on this natural ba&s;is. Lament|able experience proves the contrary. But, that re&s;pectable and amiable qualities are the primitive &s;ources of authority and pre-eminence; and, when freely allowed to exert them&s;elves, cannot fail to obtain them, will be as generally acknow|ledged as it is certain in fact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence it is ea&s;y to account for monarchies having been almo&s;t every where the primitive form of government.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> Of the <HI>DISTRIBUTION</HI> of <HI>HUMAN ABILITIES</HI> and <HI>TALENTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the various talents and modes of excellence of which the human &s;pecies is capable, we &s;hall acknowledge that neither all the&s;e, nor any con&s;iderable number of them, have ever been found united in any one individual; nay, that the highe&s;t degrees of many of them are incompatible with each other. For, when di&s;tingui&s;hed honors, or exten&s;ive reputation, are acquired by illu&s;tri|ous qualities, we are not thence to infer that the per&s;ons, to whom the&s;e di&s;tinctions are allotted, &s;urpa&s;s the re&s;t of mankind in every quality be|longing to the &s;pecies; but only that they have attained &s;uperiority in &s;uch, as being more un|common, are, on that account, more admired. Tho&s;e mechanical arts and inferior virtues, with|out which human &s;ociety could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, attract no admiration, becau&s;e they are daily exhibited.
<PB N="26" REF="025234_0024_0FCCAE34ED138918">
Yet the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of mankind &s;tand more in need of the benefits which the&s;e afford, than their di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities can confer on the humble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the former. As tho&s;e endowed with the qualities mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in human life, but of inferior e&s;timation, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are di&s;play|ed in mechanical labour and art, cannot, from their occupations them&s;elves, a&s;pire at the &s;ublim|er and more elegant abilities which di&s;tingui&s;h others; the&s;e, on the other hand, mu&s;t remain de&s;titute of the more u&s;eful ones. That lei&s;ure, meditation, and &s;tudy, without which the facul|ties of the mind cannot be perfected, nece&s;&s;arily prevent that full exerci&s;e of the corporeal mem|bers, which en&s;ures their highe&s;t vigour and agi|lity. A fancy uncommonly lively and bright is adver&s;e to the patient and accurate re&s;earches of philo&s;ophy, and to the ju&s;t application of the in|tellect, in the di&s;covery and developement of truth, and the improvement of &s;cience. That minute attention to calculation, that arithmetical exactne&s;s, and that con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of the un|varying routine of bu&s;ine&s;s, which are nece&s;&s;ary to mercantile and oeconomical pur&s;uits, but which pre&s;ent no imagery to the mind, are inau&s;picious to the more elegant enjoyments of ta&s;te, and to the cultivation of the fine arts. The &s;tern and awful virtues &s;eldom a&s;&s;ociate with the gentle and
<PB N="27" REF="025234_0025_0FCCAE366BED8F48">
amiable, and, claiming re&s;pect and veneration, &s;eem to di&s;dain complacency and love. Even &s;ome corporeal perfections appear repugnant to others. The mo&s;t robu&s;t conformation of the members, and the &s;trength it produces, are not ea&s;ily united with great agility, and with delicate refinement in the organs of &s;en&s;e. In a word, it appears to be the intention of nature, that, although the human faculties are various, and capable of being carried to amazing heights of excellence; yet this &s;hould &s;eldom be accompli&s;hed, unle&s;s when un|common culture and improvement are be&s;towed on &s;ome particular faculty, or at lea&s;t, on a few faculties which have a peculiar native &s;trength.</P>
<P>Variety of talents is, therefore, more applica|ble to the &s;pecies than to individuals. The &s;eeds of each (as we have above ob&s;erved) are, per|haps, ca&s;t into every individual con&s;titution, but the &s;oil is differently adapted to them, and that particular power to which it is favourable, &s;prings up, and, if properly cultivated, comes to maturi|ty, &s;preads around its branches, and bears abun|dant fruit. It may be objected, that it &s;eems ve|ry prepo&s;terous to &s;uppo&s;e the creator implanting in any con&s;titution the principles of powers, which were never de&s;igned to come to maturity. But, let it be con&s;idered that, as the different improve|ments
<PB N="28" REF="025234_0026_0FCCAE387319A658">
of men depend on various occurrences, and, as mentioned above, the characteri&s;tical qualities of each individual will be in the united degree of their primitive &s;trength, and of the opportunities of culture; it was nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;eeds of each &s;hould be dropped into every human frame, &s;o that, when favourable circum&s;tances concurred, that power which they were be&s;t calculated to im|prove might &s;pring up and flouri&s;h, and thus as much human excellence might, on the whole, be produced as the human condition would admit. This was, moreover, nece&s;&s;ary in order to con&s;ti|tute that general &s;imilarity which characteri&s;es the &s;pecies, and unites them together in the bonds of a common nature.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, it is undoubted that tho&s;e who aim at di&s;tinction, or even at moderate degrees of excellence in a great variety of objects, generally exhibit a ridiculous figure; after having wa&s;ted their time, exhau&s;ted their powers, and &s;uperin|duced on their minds habits of incon&s;tancy and ficklene&s;s. Even the greate&s;t genui&s;es, when they leave that particular track, in which indul|gent nature had provided them with unfading lau|rels, and endeavour to invade the province, and and &s;natch the rewards of others, while they pre|&s;ent, on the one hand, the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="29" REF="025234_0027_0FCCAE397086C290">
of the &s;trength of the human mind, afford, on the other, no le&s;s convincing proofs of its weak|ne&s;s and vanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This might be illu&s;trated by many examples of a fooli&s;h affec|tation of univer&s;ality of genius.</NOTE>. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of each in|dividual devoting him&s;elf to &s;ome favourite and u&s;eful pur&s;uit, to which every other &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient, and of applying to the diligent di&s;|charge of the duties of that department in which he can produce the greate&s;t benefit to mankind, and acquire the greate&s;t honour to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid in this and the prece|ding chapter, it appears, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, That nature her&s;elf has e&s;tabli&s;hed clear and certain di&s;tinctions among men, in the various qualities allotted to each individual, and in the various op|portunities furni&s;hed them in the cour&s;e of life for their improvement. The&s;e opportunities may oc|cur, though in inferior degrees, in the rude&s;t as well as in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed &s;tates of &s;ociety. It is evident, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> That the&s;e di&s;tinctions com|prehend not the perfection of all the human pow|ers, but the &s;ingular excellence of one, or of a few of them, con&s;picuous in individuals.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> Of the <HI>MUTUAL DEPENDENCE</HI> of <HI>MANKIND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the two facts e&s;tabli&s;hed in the con|clu&s;ion of the la&s;t chapter, duly con&s;idered, it ap|pears to me that the ju&s;t notion of the natural equality of all mankind, as far as relates to their mutual duties, is to be derived; and that, howe|ver paradoxical it may &s;eem, an <HI>equality</HI> the mo&s;t exact and perfect, in re&s;pect of every moral and &s;ocial obligation, &s;prings from <HI>inequality</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Human nature is evidently endowed with a va|riety of appetites and de&s;ires, adapted to the va|rious objects which are capable of &s;upplying its wants, or of furni&s;hing it with plea&s;ures. The bo|dy &s;tands in need of con&s;tant &s;upport, which is not to be procured without con&s;iderable art and la|bour. This art and labour mu&s;t be greatly increa|&s;ed, if not only the nece&s;&s;aries, but al&s;o the con|veniencies and elegancies of life are de&s;ired, and
<PB N="31" REF="025234_0029_0FCCAE3CB42B4150">
the refinements of &s;en&s;e con&s;idered as objects of pur&s;uit. The &s;en&s;es are not only inlets of plea|&s;ures merely corporeal, but of others al&s;o of a more refined and delicate kind, of which the mind under the influence of fancy, is the chief percipi|ent. Hence they open a very exten&s;ive field of human enjoyment, and claim the whole compa&s;s of nature to admini&s;ter materials for the fine arts. The mind of man is eagerly de&s;irous of knowledge, and wi&s;hes to di&s;cover the relations, the cau&s;es and the effects, of the various objects that are pre&s;ent|ed to it. Not only corporeal wants and appe|tites, the &s;en&s;es of beauty, of harmony, and of magnificence, and the love of knowledge, &s;ubject man to nece&s;&s;ities, which mu&s;t be &s;upplied, or offer to him plea&s;ures which he cannot but de&s;ire; he is al&s;o actuated by various affections, &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ome benevolent, which &s;erve as con&s;tant &s;purs to action, and impel him into various tracks, according to the different complexions of their ob|jects.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of man; and from what has been &s;aid above, as well as from other con&s;idera|tions on which I &s;hall &s;lightly touch, it is evident, that each individual is in&s;ufficient, not only for his own perfection, but even for the &s;upply of his mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ities. The other animals are
<PB N="32" REF="025234_0030_0FCCAE3DEB396248">
by nature provided with defence and covering, with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;helter. They &s;oon attain the full vigour and the complete exerci&s;e of their powers, and, without in&s;truction or &s;uccour, can apply them with certainty to their re&s;pective ends. But man, as he enters into the world naked, de|fencele&s;s, and unprovided with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and co-operation of his &s;pe|cies, he mu&s;t ever remain in the mo&s;t abject and comfortle&s;s condition. The inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons, the &s;terility of the earth, the ferocity of &s;avage animals, his natural imbecility, oppo&s;e to his comfortable exi&s;tence &s;o many and &s;o powerful ob&s;tacles, as he could never expect of him&s;elf to &s;urmount. He is a&s;&s;ailed by evils which he cannot repel, &s;ubject to wants which he cannot &s;upply, and &s;urrounded by objects which he cannot, by his own &s;trength, convert to his u&s;e. De&s;tined for &s;ociety, he is immediately thrown on its care, and bound by his own weakne&s;s, to contribute to its &s;trength. De&s;igned to form the mo&s;t intimate union with his fellow men, he is con&s;tituted mi&s;er|able and de&s;titute without them; but, con&s;trained by this circum&s;tance, to join his efforts to theirs, he derives the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing acquired power from his natural imbecility. Furni&s;hed with ca|pacities greatly &s;uperior to in&s;tinct, he at fir&s;t ex|erci&s;es them in a manner greatly below it; and
<PB N="33" REF="025234_0031_0FCCAE3F6C19D738">
formed for infinite improvement, he proceeds from the &s;malle&s;t beginnings; but can neither be|gin nor proceed without the co-operation of his fellow men.</P>
<P>What multiplication of ingenuity, what combi|nation of indu&s;try, what concurrence of different abilities, are requi&s;ite not only to carry to perfec|tion, but even to invent and exerci&s;e, with any tolerable degree of dexterity, tho&s;e mechanical arts and employments, which exalt the citizen a|bove the &s;avage, which &s;weeten and embelli&s;h &s;o|cial life, which furni&s;h all that variety of conve|nience and plea&s;ure we daily behold and enjoy, and which, from the mo&s;t helple&s;s of the animal creation, render man the lord of the world. Will the fore&s;t be felled and moulded into furniture, the quarry be dug and poli&s;hed into materials for building, the mar&s;h drained and converted into a|rable land, the overflowing river confined to its proper channel, the inferior creatures con&s;trained to &s;uccour human weakne&s;s by their &s;uperior &s;trength, or their &s;poils be manufactured into clothing; will the &s;uperfluities of one country &s;upply the deficiencies of another, and navigation unite the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions by the mutual and permanent ties of beneficial commerce; will all this, and much more, which I forbear to enume|rate,

<P>Thus it appears that, as each individual is total|ly in&s;ufficient for his own happine&s;s, &s;o he mu&s;t depend, in a great mea&s;ure, on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others for its attainment; and that however much any one may contribute to the benefit of his fel|low men, by the excellence and &s;plendour of his abilities, whether nutural or acquired, he derives from them as much as he can be&s;tow, and fre|quently much more than he gives.</P>
<P>If the union of all, then, be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance, the convenience and the happine&s;s of each individual, and each individual can, in his turn, contribute con&s;iderably to the common wel|fare,
<PB N="35" REF="025234_0033_0FCCAE426D0CBAE8">
it follows, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this determination of nature, that order and &s;u|bordination mu&s;t be introduced, by which the different members of the community may have their proper ta&s;ks allotted to them, the talents of each be directed to their proper objects, inju&s;tice and violence be re&s;trained, and as great a &s;um of common felicity be produced, as the condition of humanity will permit. Hence, new channels are cut out for abilities, namely, tho&s;e which are ex|erci&s;ed in offices of power and authority. As rea|&s;on, however, loudly dictates the in&s;titution of the&s;e for the common good of the human race; &s;o &s;he requires that they fall to the lot of tho&s;e who are qualified to di&s;charge them. When this actually takes place, the order of nature is ob&s;erv|ed, and all its happy con&s;equences en&s;ue.

When the talents and merits of men are allowed their free cour&s;e, are permit|ted a fair field for their exerci&s;e, and are not de|prived
<PB N="36" REF="025234_0034_0FCCAE44B2716BF0">
of tho&s;e rewards which are by nature an|nexed to them, there never can be any ground to complain of inequality among men. For, howe|ver unequal their abilities and opportunities may be in them&s;elves, the mo&s;t perfect equality exi&s;ts in the di&s;tribution of the rewards and advantages annexed to each by the con&s;titution of nature. The good effects of univer&s;al indu&s;try, and the proper application of the powers of every individual, &s;o as to produce the greate&s;t good upon the whole, are then felt through all the &s;ocial body. Every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that degree of wealth, of con&s;ide|ration, and of honour, to which he is entitled by his hone&s;t indu&s;try, or by his &s;ervices to the pub|lic. The active and noble minded exert all their powers for the common welfare, in the mo&s;t effi|cacious and illu&s;trious manner. The indolent and &s;elfi&s;h are con&s;trained, by the indigence and contempt into which they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e fall, to contribute their &s;hare to it. But, when power and riches are employed to fru&s;trate virtue of the re&s;pect which is its due, abilities, of the di&s;tinction and influence which they ju&s;tly claim, and hone&s;t indu&s;try, of its natural fruits, a mo&s;t &s;hocking <HI>in|equality</HI> takes place, which can only &s;ub&s;i&s;t in con|junction with the mo&s;t odious tyranny.

If one is exalted to power, or illu&s;trious by fame, tho&s;e who faithfully di&s;charge the duties of an hum|ble and ob&s;cure &s;tation, enable him to fulfil the duties of his more con&s;picuous one, and con|tribute to his exaltation, by occupying tho&s;e parts of the general &s;y&s;tem, without which the higher orders could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and by paying him that deference and re&s;pect to which his merit is in|titled. If one is eminent by his wi&s;dom and &s;a|gacity, by his genius and wit, by his knowledge and erudition; another is no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by his activity and &s;trength, by his &s;kill and dexterity, by his indu&s;try and labour. If one is venerable by his elevation of &s;oul, by his genero&s;ity, public &s;pirit, and intrepidity; another is amiable by his gentlene&s;s and complai&s;ance, by his patience, mo|de&s;ty, and meekne&s;s; and, if the former qualities are the ornaments, the latter are the great &s;weet|ners, of life, while both, operating in conjunction, &s;upply mutual defects, and impart mutual &s;trength and imbelli&s;hment. If tho&s;e who fill the higher &s;tations in a becoming manner, confer the greate&s;t benefits on their fellow men, they are equally in|debted
<PB N="39" REF="025234_0037_0FCCAE49304F8208">
to them for their &s;upport. If the latter &s;tand in need of the judgment and penetration of the former; in order to devi&s;e the be&s;t plans of pro&s;ecuting the public good, and of maintaining the general &s;afety; the&s;e, again, &s;tand in need of their re&s;olution and diligence to carry their plans into execution. If &s;ome contribute to the in&s;truc|tion and improvement of their fellow men, by teaching and illu&s;trating the grand principles of virtue, on which the welfare of &s;ociety is princi|pally founded, tho&s;e who enjoy the benefit of their in&s;tructions, turn them to their profit, by practi&s;ing towards them the virtues which they in|culcate. If one cla&s;s of men maintain good or|der and peace, and another exerci&s;e all the ele|gant and u&s;eful arts of &s;ocial life, there are o|thers who &s;ecure the&s;e enjoyments and advanta|ges again&s;t external inva&s;ion, and offer their blood as their contribution to the common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>As, in the human body, therefore, the welfare of the whole depends upon that of each individual member, and that again is nece&s;&s;arily affected by whatever affects the whole &s;y&s;tem; and there is thus a mutual dependence and &s;ympathy among all the parts; &s;o, in &s;ociety, every individual having a particular portion of talents, and, if properly placed, a particular &s;tation, conformable to this,
<PB N="40" REF="025234_0038_0FCCAE4B41A5E7D0">
allotted to him, becomes nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of the whole community, and as he affects, is like|wi&s;e affected by, its pro&s;perity or detriment. All are united by mutual dependence and &s;upport: Break but one link of the chain, and the re&s;t are of no u&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, are deprived of much ad|vantage and comfort, which is enjoyed when the &s;ocial &s;eries is complete.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be alledged, that many of tho&s;e wants, which cannot be &s;upplied but in &s;oci|ety, are not the wants of nature, but are merely adventitious, and generated in that &s;ociety, the nece&s;&s;ity of which they are produced to prove. We readily grant that, in refined and highly po|li&s;hed &s;tates of civilized life, where luxury has u|niver&s;ally diffu&s;ed its effeminating influence, ma|ny wants and de&s;ires are generated, which are not only not agreeable to nature, but repugnant to human perfection and felicity. Let it how|ever be ob&s;erved, that this pernicious tendency to human happine&s;s begins by loo&s;ening tho&s;e ties which knit men mo&s;t firmly together. It is &s;elfi&s;h, not &s;ocial, enjoyments which are mo&s;t ad|ver&s;e to him an perfection, and man begins to in|jure his own happine&s;s, by &s;eparating it from the general good. It is undoubted that all the origi|nal powers of human nature are carried to the
<PB N="41" REF="025234_0039_0FCCAE4C2D9DDF28">
highe&s;t perfection in &s;ociety, and droop and lan|gui&s;h in &s;olitude. That &s;tate, &s;urely, which is mo&s;t perfective of every human faculty, is the mo&s;t <HI>natural,</HI> and it is only by the &s;trange&s;t perver&s;ion of terms and ideas that the contrary can be a&s;&s;ert|ed. But the perfection of the &s;ocial &s;tate cannot be attained, without the mutual dependence of mankind, in that exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e in which I have exhibited it. That dependence is, therefore, found|ed in the con&s;titution of nature it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV. FINAL CAUSES</HI> of the <HI>VARIETY</HI> of <HI>HUMAN TALENTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is evidently the intention of Divine Provi|dence in be&s;towing upon different per&s;ons different powers and abilities, to point them out for diffe|rent &s;tations and circum&s;tances, to a&s;&s;ign to them different duties and ta&s;ks, and thus to promote mo&s;t effectually the welfare of the human &s;pecies. By this &s;cheme, it is unque&s;tionable, many more advantages are obtained, with regard to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, than could have been &s;ecur|ed by di&s;pen&s;ing the &s;ame portion of ability and virtue, that di&s;tingui&s;hes our &s;pecies, on any other plan whatever. For every particular talent is thus cultivated with greater &s;ucce&s;s, when it oc|cupies the con&s;tant and habitual attention of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, than it could have been if he had been overloaded with a multiplicity of employments, or di&s;tracted by the exerci&s;e of various abilities. A greater &s;um of excellence is thus produced in the &s;pecies, and, of con&s;equence, its perfection and
<PB N="43" REF="025234_0041_0FCCAE4FB9FDC788">
happine&s;s is more effectually promoted. By this plan of di&s;tribution, moreover, opportunities are afforded for the exerci&s;e of many virtues, which could not have otherwi&s;e exi&s;ted. Thus, were all equally wi&s;e and learned, no opportunity could be afforded for di&s;playing either a communi|cative or a docile di&s;po&s;ition. Were all equally rich, or equally powerful, neither genero&s;ity nor gratitude could be excited; and, as there could be no demand for &s;uccour and protection, on the one hand, &s;o, on the other, there would be no oc|ca&s;ion for conde&s;cen&s;ion and &s;ympathy. Finally, mankind by being rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to each other, are con&s;trained to maintain a mutu|al intercour&s;e of good offices; and &s;ociety is thus united by the firme&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting bonds.</P>
<P>In fact, this diver&s;ity of talents and virtues ap|pears to be the chief circum&s;tance which qualifies men for a &s;ocial and political exi&s;tence. Were all endowed with the &s;ame definite portion of pow|ers, of whatever kind, to what purpo&s;e would men a&s;&s;ociate, &s;ince they would derive little more from their union than they individually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? An accumulation of mere &s;trength would be the only effect of combined powers, in the &s;ame man|ner that &s;ix hor&s;es can draw a greater weight, and to a greater di&s;tance, than two. This diver&s;ity of
<PB N="44" REF="025234_0042_0FCCAE50B0E34A10">
abilities, by rendering mankind mutually depend|ent from their detached weakne&s;s, becomes the &s;tronge&s;t motive to a&s;&s;ociation, the mo&s;t powerful bond of &s;ociety, and its greate&s;t excellence and perfection, when it is properly arranged. With|out this, and on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;ame &s;pe|cific qualities were, as in the brutes, allotted to each individual, a more perfect <HI>equality</HI> would indeed be e&s;tabli&s;hed among all the members of the &s;pecies; but it would be an <HI>equality</HI> u&s;ele&s;s for every purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;ociation, and would &s;erve ra|ther to &s;eparate than to unite them. This circum|&s;tance I am inclined to think, has not hitherto been &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, at lea&s;t not in the light in which I have repre&s;ented it. In this light, tho&s;e pleas of &s;uperior wi&s;dom, or of &s;upe|rior power, which Ari&s;totle*, and &s;ome late wri|ters, who appear not very favourable to the cau&s;e of equal freedom, have urged as the foundations of the dominion of one part of mankind over the re&s;t, are de&s;titute of all force. For, if the&s;e pleas &s;hould be admitted, even in their utmo&s;t ex|tent, they will furni&s;h no ground for independent dominion and &s;uperiority, unle&s;s it can be proved, at the &s;ame time, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e qua|lities are equally endowed with every other which is nece&s;&s;ary or conducive to human felicity. Should
<PB N="45" REF="025234_0043_0FCCAE52E1875FC0">
the wi&s;dom and the &s;trength (as is commonly the ca&s;e) be found indifferent &s;ubjects, it will remain to be decided to which the &s;uperiority is to be a&s;&s;ign|ed, and what particular degree of each of the&s;e qua|lities is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a rightful claim. Art and ingenuity may likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves en|titled to &s;ome portion of dominion, &s;ince it is un|doubted that their influence is very con&s;iderable in the affairs of life. In this manner, every thing is thrown into confu&s;ion, and no clear no|tion of <HI>right</HI> is any where left. But, by the view we have taken of the &s;ubject, (which will, I flat|ter my&s;elf, be found to be the true one) every man acquires a clear and definite claim according to the portion he contributes to the general wel|fare, a mo&s;t &s;alutary <HI>equality</HI> is &s;till left among mankind, and the community is knit together by ties which cannot be di&s;&s;olved, without the de|&s;truction of general and particular happine&s;s. In a word, the &s;lighte&s;t contemplation of human na|ture convinces us that man is de&s;igned by his Cre|ator for &s;ociety, and, as this was his de&s;tination, he is &s;o con&s;tituted as to be impelled towards it by all his propen&s;ities and powers, and linked to it by all his wants and enjoyments, with whatever abi|lities he may be endowed, or in whatever &s;tation he may be placed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER V.</HI> The ju&s;t Notion of the <HI>NATURAL EQUALITY</HI> of <HI>MEN</HI> is placed in <HI>EQUALITY</HI> of <HI>OBLIGATION.</HI>&mdash;The proper <HI>TENDENCY</HI> of this <HI>DOCTRINE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been already &s;aid, it will now &s;ufficiently appear, that the mo&s;t perfect equa|lity of obligation, of benefits received and return|ed, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all the members of &s;ociety, of whatever denomination or degree, who faithfully di&s;charge their duties; that that dependence, which the proud and the powerful are fain to li|mit to one &s;phere and &s;tation, runs through all alike, and that independence, at which all a&s;pire, is no where to be found among men. For al|though any human being &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every imaginable perfection and advantage; yet while he lives in &s;ociety, and abundantly &s;atisfies all his &s;ocial propen&s;ities, from which the &s;ublim|e&s;t plea&s;ures of human nature are derived, he re|ceives from mankind &s;uch an ample portion of hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="47" REF="025234_0045_0FCCAE552EAF0108">
that he is bound to compen&s;ate it by every return, which the utmo&s;t exertion of his abilities can enable him to make. From his elevated &s;upe|riority he is thus obliged to de&s;cend to the <HI>equali|ty</HI> of a citizen, and of a man.</P>
<P>In the eye of rea&s;on, therefore, and of the Univer&s;al Parent, every hone&s;t &s;tation of life is equally honourable, &s;ince they are all but parts of the great &s;ocial body which his wi&s;dom has planned, and his power pre&s;erves. In this view, no human creature is more or le&s;s worthy than another, but in as far as he di&s;charges or neglects the part allotted to him, and augments or dimi|ni&s;hes the &s;um of general felicity; or as he occu|pies a place which he is incapable of filling, de|prives others of their ju&s;t &s;tation, &s;natches, from them the rewards to which they are entitled, or prevents them from performing the duties of the &s;tation in which they are placed, and of the &s;phere in which they move.</P>
<P>The principles above e&s;tabli&s;hed are widely dif|ferent from tho&s;e which pride and tyranny em|brace and inculcate. If men are endowed with &s;uperior abilities, or rai&s;ed to an exalted &s;tation, they will not ea&s;ily admit that, between them and their inferiors, the dependence and the obligation
<PB N="48" REF="025234_0046_0FCCAE56AB292220">
are reciprocal. Unle&s;s they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by peculiar genero&s;ity of &s;entiment, they will con&s;i|der it as no very plea&s;ing doctrine that, between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject, the magi&s;trate and the people, the great and the mean, the rich and the poor, the acute and the dull, the learned and the ignorant, there is no difference but in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of different powers, and in the di&s;charge of different offices peculiar to each capacity, and u&s;eful to all; and that, if the fir&s;t have a ju&s;t de|mand on the &s;econd for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, for honour and re&s;pect, for convenience and ea&s;e, the &s;econd have as ju&s;t a claim on them for protec|tion and defence, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and the pre&s;ervation of equal liberty, for the &s;up|ply of their wants and the relief of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, for in&s;truction and good example. Pride and ty|ranny would place, on the one &s;ide, all honour and re&s;pect, and nothing but di&s;regard and con|tempt, on the other; here, all oppre&s;&s;ion and vio|lence, and there, all patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; here, all convenience and plea&s;ure, and there, all la|bour and indigence; here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> have the &s;mal|le&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be con&s;idered as an eternal obliga|tion, and there, the greate&s;t &s;ervices to pa&s;s for indi&s;pen&s;ible duties. With &s;uch &s;entiments, it is no wonder that the mutual dependence and obli|gation of men &s;hould be rejected as a dangerous
<PB N="49" REF="025234_0047_0FCCAE5834E35268">
and odious doctrine, equally &s;ubver&s;ive of public order, and of private right. Tho&s;e who think and act in this manner, either making no returns for the benefits they receive from &s;ociety, or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing no capacity to make them, are eager to re|pre&s;ent every notion of mutual obligation and e|quality among men, as imaginary and pre&s;umptu|ous, and to oblige the world to look on them as its e&s;tabli&s;hed lords. But &s;uch opinions can never retain their influence, when knowledge has begun to make any progre&s;s, and mankind to under&s;tand their own nature and dignity. The bodies of men can never be en&s;laved, when their minds are free; and the mo&s;t diligent care of all de&s;pots, of what|ever rank or denomination, ever has been, and ever mu&s;t be, to keep mankind in ignorance. As &s;oon as knowledge diffu&s;es her light over the dun|geon in which they are inchained, the doors are thrown open, and their chains fall off. In fact, pride and tyranny, by de&s;troying that mutual obligation, and that ju&s;t equality which we have now e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ap the very pillars which &s;up|port greatne&s;s and di&s;play &s;plendour. For, if there is no mutual obligation, no parity of right, then power, on the one hand, and weakne&s;s on the other, are the only bonds of &s;ocial or civil uni|on. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee where, in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, the greate&s;t power will be found; whether
<PB N="50" REF="025234_0048_0FCCAE59A97284F8">
in the hands of the poor, the mean, the illiterate; or in tho&s;e of the rich, the great, the learned, and the ingenious. But if the grand principle of <HI>equa|lity</HI> of obligation, and of mutual dependence, is adopted in opinion, as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed in nature, if &s;tations and offices are neither unju&s;tly u&s;urped, nor their duties perfidiou&s;ly and weakly performed, the obligation to obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is as &s;trong on inferiors, as that of ju&s;tice and di&s;inte|re&s;ted zeal for the public good is on rulers and magi&s;trates; and the honor obtained by di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities is equally due to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as the fruits of their hone&s;t labour are due to the lower orders of the community. This principle places the fabric of &s;ociety on a firm and la&s;ting foundation, and all the parts of the building, how|ever different in point of &s;plendour and ornament, are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the whole, that none of them can be removed or de|faced, without injuring the beauty or the &s;olidity of the &s;tructure. This equally balances all the parts and members of the &s;ocial body, makes pre-emi|nence it&s;elf emerge from common intere&s;t, and again depre&s;&s;es that &s;eparate independence which pre-eminence would a&s;&s;ume, by referring it to that collective power from which it is wholly derived. A con&s;tant balance, and reaction of obligation and duty, is thus maintained through all the depart|ments
<PB N="51" REF="025234_0049_0FCCAE5B2B8451E0">
of &s;ociety, &s;imilar to what we ob&s;erve in nature. As exhalations and vapours from the ocean and the lower parts of the earth, re&s;ting on the tops of mountains, form the &s;prings whence are derived the rivers that water and fertilize the different regions of the globe, and return at la&s;t into the ocean, and thus a con&s;tant circulation is maintained; &s;o the more elevated &s;phere of &s;ocie|ty derive their political exi&s;tence and energy from the general ma&s;s, and, if properly filled, diffu&s;e through the whole &s;ocial body a &s;alutary influence, which again &s;erves to maintain their dignity and &s;plendour. The individuals that occupy the&s;e &s;pheres, detached from &s;ociety, and con&s;idered merely as individuals of the human race, are en|titled to no di&s;tinction or &s;uperiority, but what ari&s;es from corporeal or mental qualities, which are the di&s;tinctions of nature. But, viewed in their connection with the political body, they claim their pre-eminence and power, on the &s;ame principle by which &s;ociety is held together, name|ly, that the general good mu&s;t limit the preten&s;i|ons of individuals.</P>
<P>This is that <HI>equality</HI> of mankind, which has been &s;o often a&s;&s;erted, but is &s;eldom well under|&s;tood&mdash;an <HI>equality</HI> which the proud and tyrannical di&s;dain, becau&s;e it oppo&s;es their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or in|dolence&mdash;an
<PB N="52" REF="025234_0050_0FCCAE5D79C52770">
<HI>equality</HI> which turbulent and de&s;ign|ing men are fain to abu&s;e as an engine for over|turning regularity and government, and for in|troducing that anarchy in the mid&s;t of which they them&s;elves are to ri&s;e. It is an <HI>equality</HI> which im|plies &s;ubordination&mdash;an <HI>equality</HI> of wants, with a diver&s;ity of means of &s;upplying them&mdash;an <HI>equality</HI> of obligation, with different modes of di&s;charging it. It is an <HI>equality</HI> which, by rendering all equal|ly nece&s;&s;ary, makes all, who faithfully di&s;charge their duties, equally honourable in the &s;ight of God; but, by requiring higher and lower &s;tations, and various di&s;tinctions and &s;pheres, e&s;tabli&s;hes different degrees of re&s;pectability and honour a|mong men. It is an <HI>equality</HI> which degrades none but the tyrant, the ruffian, the thief, the volup|tuary, and the &s;luggard; and exalts all, but the&s;e, to the ennobling dignity of con&s;tituent members of the grand community of mankind, and of fel|low labourers with God in advancing the felicity of his moral and intellectual creation.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s ab&s;urd, than pernicious, therefore, is that levelling notion, which confounds all di&s;tinc|tions and ranks, annihilates &s;ubordination, and de&s;troys that ju&s;t <HI>equality</HI> which is founded in na|ture, and in human happine&s;s. While this fran|tic opinion is directly contrary to the appointment
<PB N="53" REF="025234_0051_0FCCAE5EE9951888">
of God in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ociety, and horri|bly de&s;tructive in its con&s;equences, it commonly tends, like every other extravagant and vicious pa&s;&s;ion, to fru&s;trate its own gratification. Taking <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> for <HI>liberty,</HI> it becomes the greate&s;t promoter of de&s;poti&s;m. For, as nothing has brought religion more into di&s;repute, than bigo|try, fanatici&s;m, and hypocri&s;y, which have &s;o of|ten a&s;&s;umed that venerable and &s;acred name; and as nothing has brought &s;o much di&s;grace on philo&s;ophy, both in ancient and modern times, as the profligate lives of pretended philo&s;ophers; &s;o <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> appearing under the di&s;gui&s;e of <HI>liber|ty,</HI> has a direct tendency to render it either odious or contemptible. The tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ors of their fellow men, and their &s;ervile abettors, ea|gerly lay hold of the horrid exce&s;&s;es which licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s produces, and at which they &s;ecretly re|joice, as infidels delight in the corruptions of reli|gion; paint them with the deepe&s;t colours of an inflamed imagination; and a&s;cribe them with tri|umph to tho&s;e principles of true liberty, to which they are &s;o repugnant in their origin, and &s;o per|nicious in their con&s;equences. The ignorant mul|titude, incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing appearances from realities, ha&s;tily admit both the a&s;&s;ertion and its inference, and &s;eek refuge from arnarchy in the chains of de&s;poti&s;m. The wi&s;e, however and the

the &s;ons of men, feel le&s;s the &s;en&s;e of hunger and thir&s;t, of cold and pain, than tho&s;e of contrary de|&s;criptions; or are the&s;e la&s;t le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed than the former, by the general con&s;truction and or|gans of the human frame; Do not the rich and the poor, the ob&s;cure and the elevated, come into the world in the &s;ame &s;tate of imbecility and wretchedne&s;s? Is the infant of opulent parents po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater vigour, or does he require le&s;s the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e on who&s;e care he is immedi|ately ca&s;t, than the infant of the pea&s;ant or the beggar? Can he already di&s;cern and provide his food, u&s;e his limbs, defend him&s;elf from danger, and, by his hereditary independence, vindicate the true &s;uperiority of his condition? So far is any of the&s;e from being the ca&s;e, that, if there is any difference, in the&s;e re&s;pects, between him and the infant of meaner rank, it is all in favour of the latter.

<P><PB N="57" REF="025234_0055_0FCCAE659105BE08">Again, the &s;ame natural principles, propen&s;ities, and affections, operate on all mankind with differ|ent degrees of force, according to their different &s;ituations. All men, of whatever rank or condi|tion, are &s;trongly actuated by a principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, by the love of liberty, by the de|&s;ire of plea&s;ure, and an aver&s;ion to pain, by the love of &s;ociety, and a di&s;like of &s;olitude, by the parental, conjugal, and filial attachments, by a &s;en&s;e of honour, by re&s;entment of injuries, and by a certain affection for their country. None are de&s;titute of &s;ome perception of beauty, order, and magnificence in the works of nature or art, and none, but &s;uch as are mon&s;trou&s;ly corrupted, are in&s;en&s;ible to the eternal di&s;tinctions of right and wrong, of virtue and vice, of truth and error, in human judgments and actions. Even the mo&s;t &s;tupid, ignorant and perver&s;e of the human &s;pecies differ, in this re&s;pect, from the brutes, that, as they remember the pa&s;t, and anticipate the future, &s;o they are capable of forming and pur&s;uing &s;ome plan of life, of conceiving &s;ome &s;y&s;tem of happi|ne&s;s which they de&s;ire to attain, or &s;ome image of mi&s;ery which they endeavour to avoid. No human being, therefore, enjoys or &s;uffers like the inferior animals, according to the blind impul&s;es of appetite, or the unanticipated impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;e, but has &s;ome previous deliberation and choice, with
<PB N="58" REF="025234_0056_0FCCAE666C704C08">
regard to the objects of de&s;ire and aver&s;ion. Every mortal al&s;o feels that, by the birth-right of human nature, he is entitled to certain <HI>rights,</HI> of which he cannot be deprived without cea&s;ing to be a man, or without envying the condition of the inferior creatures. The&s;e are the common features of humanity which characteri&s;e all the &s;pecies, and e&s;tabli&s;h among them &s;o many points of equality.</P>
<P N="2">II. All men are equal in being equally expo&s;ed to vici&s;&s;itudes, and to death. To attempt any proof of the&s;e facts would be nugatory and ridicu|lous. But the con&s;equences to be deduced from them, with re&s;pect to the light in which the differ|ent orders and de&s;criptions of men ought to view each other, are not &s;o evident, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s not that influence over the heart, to which they are in rea&s;on entitled. For, if the mo&s;t exalt|ed of mankind mu&s;t, as well as the lowe&s;t, &s;ubmit to the &s;troke of death, and moulder the prey of worms in the grave, if this event equally hangs over his head every moment, and, when it hap|pens, mu&s;t &s;trip him of every external di&s;tinction; can any preten&s;ions be more ab&s;urd than tho&s;e of pride, which are &s;olely founded on a pre-eminence &s;o tran&s;ient and uncertain? For any one, there|fore, to value him&s;elf on &s;uch tran&s;itory di&s;tincti|ons, is as ridiculous, as it would be for a traveller

to imagine him&s;elf proprietor of every field through which he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the &s;tations which di&s;criminate the dif|ferent orders of &s;ociety, are by no means perma|nently attached to any number of individuals that may now enjoy them, or to their de&s;cendants. They are &s;ubject to many vici&s;&s;itudes, and have a con&s;tant tendency to change. As the parts of ma|terial nature are in perpetual fluctuation, and are &s;ometimes altered by &s;ecret and &s;ilent decays, &s;ometimes by violent convul&s;ions, by tempe&s;ts, hurricanes, inundations, earthquakes and volcanos, &s;o the various orders of &s;ociety are expo&s;ed to con&s;tant changes, partly by &s;udden and violent agitations, partly by tho&s;e &s;ecret, but certain cau&s;es, which are continually operating the exalta|tion or the depre&s;&s;ion of men. Foreign wars or do|me&s;tic commotions, &s;ignal calamities or uncommon pro&s;perity, illu&s;trious virtues or flagrant vices, pro|duce the mo&s;t wonderful alterations in human for|tunes. Leaving the public tran&s;actions of our own times, which furni&s;h mo&s;t &s;triking proofs of this fact, what numberle&s;s in&s;tances croud into the mind while it revolves the events of ancient or modern hi&s;tory!</P>

<P>There is, be&s;ides, in every &s;tation a certain ten|dency to change, and the &s;ame cau&s;es that produc|ed the elevation of the higher orders of men, are imperceptibly operating al&s;o in favour of others placed in inferior conditions. As a projectile, when it has reached its highe&s;t point of elevation, begins immediately to de&s;cend, and continues its cour&s;e downwards with an accelerated velocity; &s;o there appears to be a certain point of exaltation, beyond which human grandeur cannot proceed, and which, by being the termination of &s;plendour, becomes the beginning of decline, and of final pre|cipitation. On the other hand, as the &s;eed of a tree, from the moment it is dropped into the ground, is continually expanding, and receiving
<PB N="61" REF="025234_0059_0FCCAE6BACB12D68">
from the earth new additions to its growth, till it mingle its branches with the clouds, and cover the &s;oil with its &s;hade; in lik manner, among the lower orders of men, there are evident principles of increa&s;e and amelioration of their condition, which fail not to operate &s;ucce&s;sfully when they are favoured by opportunities.</P>
<P>For, what are the vices which are apte&s;t to in|fect elevated and and affluent circum&s;tances; and what the virtues which an humble and hard lot mo&s;t ea&s;ily engenders and cheri&s;hes? In the for|mer, we often behold pride, which excites indig|nation and hatred, and, con&s;equently, combinati|ons to repre&s;s it. We behold luxury and extrava|gance, which wa&s;te rapidly the mo&s;t &s;plendid for|tunes, and incapacitate for exertion and activity. We behold carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention, which al|low people's affairs to run into di&s;order, and oc|ca&s;ion irreparable confu&s;ion at la&s;t. We often behold extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, and flagrant abu&s;e of power, in order to retrieve broken circum&s;tan|ces, which ha&s;ten the ruin they are employed to prevent, and produce indelible di&s;grace.</P>
<P>In an humble and &s;evere lot, we frequently &s;ee humility and mode&s;ty, which never fail to concili|ate complacency. We &s;ee patience and frugality,
<PB N="62" REF="025234_0060_0FCCAE6DB627AD90">
of which the former renders the harde&s;t conditi|on tolerable, and the latter draws ea&s;e from pe|nury. We &s;ee indu&s;try, and a &s;ucce&s;sful exertion of abilities, which fir&s;t make men u&s;eful and indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary even to their &s;uperiors; then bring them into notice and regard; and, la&s;tly, rai&s;e them to tru&s;t and affluence. Thus, while tho&s;e who are placed in the highe&s;t &s;tations, &s;uppo&s;ing they have no exertions to make, becau&s;e they have reached the pinnacle of human greatne&s;s, are verging towards decline and ob&s;cu|rity, tho&s;e who move in an inferior &s;phere, urged by their nece&s;&s;ities, or &s;timulated by their ambiti|on, are making con&s;tant efforts to ri&s;e, watching every favourable opportunity of &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;i|lently climbing the &s;teep from which the former are de&s;cending. Where are now tho&s;e illu&s;trious families that occupy &s;uch a remarkable place in ancient hi&s;tory? They are not &s;urely all extinct; their de&s;cendants, doubtle&s;s, exi&s;t &s;omewhere up|on the earth. But they are confounded with the general ma&s;s of mankind, while others have ari&s;en to &s;hine in the &s;phere from which they have de|parted. It is thus that Divine Providence, which has, for the wi&s;e&s;t rea&s;ons, e&s;tabli&s;hed, an inequa|lity of &s;tations and talents among men, has by al|lowing their virtues and vices to operate their na|tural effects of alternate depre&s;&s;ion and exaltation,

re&s;tored the balance, which di&s;appears from the view of &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P N="3">III. If we ju&s;tly e&s;timate the advantages and inconveniencies of every condition of life, we &s;hall find that they nearly balance each other, that the &s;um of happine&s;s, &s;hared among the human &s;pecies, is divided in pretty equitable portions; and that equality of enjoyment is another ground, on which the different ranks of &s;ociety, if not the individuals that are placed in them, are on a level. The grand difference, in this re&s;pect, con&s;i&s;ts in what is appropriated to no &s;tation or fortune, but is e|qually open to them all&mdash;internal di&s;po&s;ition and character; which it is unque&s;tionable, may be di&s;|played in their greate&s;t excellence, and enjoyed in their highe&s;t perfection, in the lowe&s;t, as well as in the mo&s;t elevated, &s;phere. As the different regions of the globe, however removed from the Equator, or the Poles, enjoy equal mea&s;ures of light and darkne&s;s, though di&s;tributed in different manners; &s;o the different orders of &s;ociety po&s;&s;e&s;s equal portions of felicity, and are expo&s;ed to equal pains, though the modes of enjoyment and &s;uffer|ing be diver&s;ified. If the honours of an exalted &s;tation are greater than tho&s;e of an humble one, its duties are al&s;o more difficult, if its virtues are more &s;plendid, its temptations are more enticing,
<PB N="64" REF="025234_0062_0FCCAE7029F397F0">
and its vices more con&s;picuous; if its enjoyments are more refined, its &s;ufferings are more acute, and its afflictions more durable. Is it &s;uppo&s;ed that the burden of labour is heavier than that of indo|lence, or the pains of indigence greater than tho&s;e of &s;en&s;uality? Con&s;ider that health often &s;miles, on the cheek of poverty, while di&s;ea&s;e deforms the face of opulence. Do any imagine that the &s;olicitude of providing daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is greater than that which attends the improvement, or the &s;ecurity, of an exten&s;ive e&s;tate&mdash;that the real wants of na|ture afford more anxiety and care, than the ima|ginary demands of extravagance&mdash;that the evils which are really felt, are greater than tho&s;e which di&s;tempered fancy creates?&mdash;let &s;uch con&s;i|der the di&s;content, the unea&s;ine&s;s, the dejection, the wayward humours, and the &s;ullen gloom, that &s;o often haunt the great and the wealthy, and acknowledge that &s;leep vi&s;its the couch of &s;traw, and flies from the bed of down.</P>
<P>Do any imagine that it is more difficult to pur|&s;ue, with con&s;tancy and firmne&s;s, the rugged and thorny paths of the humble vale of life, than to maintain the elevated po&s;ts of dignity and honour, in the mid&s;t of intrigue, of competition, of cla|mour, and of all the uncertainty of favor? Let them reflect on the &s;olicitudes and the terrors of
<PB N="65" REF="025234_0063_0FCCAE721E329740">
the public governor, when un&s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ues at|tend his admini&s;tration, when the tide of popular approbation begins to ebb, when his enemies &s;pread di&s;content through the land, repre&s;ent him to the people as the author of their calamities, and rou&s;e them to &s;acrifice him as the victim of their fury. The &s;torm often bur&s;ts on the palace, when it pa&s;|&s;es inoffen&s;ively over the cottage!</P>
<P N="4">IV. All men are equal in having &s;ome peculiar duty to di&s;charge, &s;ome peculiar advantages for the exhibition of corre&s;ponding virtues, &s;ome pe|culiar temptations to corre&s;ponding vices, and in being placed in a cour&s;e of probation for a future and final &s;tate. If the duties of each &s;tation are properly di&s;charged, its virtues proportionably di&s;played, and its temptations &s;urmounted, it is difficult to &s;ay whether the greate&s;t prai&s;e is due to the &s;uperior or inferior ranks of &s;ociety. If the duties or the virtues of either are neglected, or its temptations allowed to prevail, the blame is equal on both &s;ides, although the puni&s;hments are frequently di&s;tributed very unequally under human governments. That all men are at pre|&s;ent placed in a preparatory &s;tate for a future ex|i&s;tence, both natural and revealed religion concur in evincing. It is no le&s;s evident, from the ex|ternal principles by which the divine government
<PB N="66" REF="025234_0064_0FCCAE7332B2D9F0">
is admini&s;tered, that the characters which men have acquired in the pre&s;ent period of being, will be the only mea&s;ures of their future fate, and that all tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which are wholly ex|ternal, will then di&s;appear forever! If any re|gard is then paid to the different &s;tations which men have occupied here below, it will only be in order to determine how far they have di&s;charged the duties of them, and what degree of merit, or demerit, is to be a&s;&s;igned to each individual, according to the talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the op|portunities he enjoyed for the practice of every virtue. Here all men are placed on the mo&s;t per|fect equality, have the &s;ame hopes, the &s;ame fears, the &s;ame pleas to urge, the &s;ame titles to produce, or rather are levelled by the &s;ame incapacity of all merit, but what is derived from the clemency of the Great Judge, operating through the plan of &s;alvation he has e&s;tabli&s;hed. With his eyes turned to this &s;cene, with any adequate impre&s;&s;ion of this awful con&s;ummation on his heart, (and mad mu&s;t he be to who&s;e mind &s;uch thoughts are never pre|&s;ent!) can any one deny the equality of mankind, nor perceive the empty titles, and tin&s;el &s;plendors and idle pageants of this tran&s;itory period, &s;wim|ming before his &s;ight, and finally di&s;appearing, like the dreams which occupy his fancy in &s;leep, but fade and are forgotten when he opens his eyes, and again enjoys the reality of things.</P>

<P>IN the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of moral and metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects, hardly any thing has occa&s;ioned greater ob&s;curity, and, of con&s;equence, more violent di&s;|putes, than the ambiguity of terms, and the vague and indeterminate ideas annexed to them by dif|ferent parties. Of this no word can afford a more &s;triking in&s;tance than the term <HI>right,</HI> e&s;pecially when applied to denote a moral capacity to <HI>act,</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="025234_0067_0FCCAE786C48AF68">
to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s,</HI> or to <HI>demand,</HI> in certain circum&s;tances. Of this the notion will be found to be as various, as the philo&s;ophical or religious &s;y&s;tems which men have adopted, the profe&s;&s;ions which they have embraced, the &s;tations which they occupy, or the company they frequent. Although peo|ple may agree in &s;ome general and indefinite no|tions of <HI>right,</HI> yet, in the peculiar ideas they en|tertain with regard to its application to all the particular objects of human action and pur&s;uit, it will be found that their conceptions are not redu|cible to any determinate &s;tandard. We are not, on this account, however, to imagine that the rights of men are indefinable, or that there are not general cla&s;&s;es to which they may be reduced. For, although the private rights of individuals mu&s;t vary according to their different circum&s;tan|ces and relations, there are &s;till certain and per|manent principles on which they are founded, and from which they mu&s;t be deduced, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e powers which fraud &s;ecretly obtains, or violence openly u&s;urps. Un|le&s;s this were the ca&s;e, laws and obligations would be unmeaning words, and power the only arbiters of right and wrong.</P>
<P>Without entering at pre&s;ent into any ab&s;tru&s;e and refined &s;peculations concerning the foundation
<PB N="71" REF="025234_0068_0FCCAE79EC43E8C0">
of moral obligation, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that we &s;eem, in general, to denominate that <HI>right</HI> which has a tendency to promote the univer&s;al happine&s;s of mankind, or that of the individual him&s;elf, when it is not repugnant to the more exten&s;ive intere&s;t, whether of the whole &s;pecies, or of the &s;maller communities into which the &s;pecies is di|vided. To the&s;e two general heads, namely, <HI>ten|dency</HI> to general, and <HI>tendency</HI> to particular hap|pine&s;s, when properly limited, it will be found that every thing ju&s;t, and honorable, and prai&s;e-worthy, in human &s;entiments and conduct is ulti|mately referable. Whoever <HI>does,</HI> or <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>demands,</HI> what is conducive to the common good, or to his own intere&s;t in con&s;i&s;tency with this, that he &s;hould <HI>do,</HI> or <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s,</HI> or <HI>demand,</HI> we &s;ay he has a <HI>right</HI> to <HI>do,</HI> to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> or to <HI>demand,</HI> it.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the only notions we can form to our&s;elves of happine&s;s mu&s;t be derived from tho&s;e original principles of our nature, by which certain objects are con&s;tituted the means of &s;atis|faction and plea&s;ure, and others the cau&s;es of un|ea&s;ine&s;s and pain. The former become, on that account, <HI>de&s;irable,</HI> and the latter, <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> and <HI>odious.</HI> By implanting the&s;e de&s;ires and aver&s;ions in the &s;oul of man, the Creator evidently intend|ed that they &s;hould be indulged within the limits

he has pre&s;cribed to them, and, in order to di&s;co+ver the&s;e limits, has &s;uperadded the noble faculty of rea&s;on. Accordingly, there &s;eems annexed to every natural <HI>de&s;ire</HI> and <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> of the heart, a certain feeling of a <HI>right</HI> to its indulgence. The original propen&s;ities and de&s;ires &s;pring up &s;ponta|neou&s;ly in the &s;oul, and impel it to action. In children, the&s;e are the fir&s;t &s;timulants to motion and activity, and, as they are &s;till undirected by the higher principles of our nature, and by the improvements of experience, con&s;titute their on|ly notions of <HI>right.</HI> As the inferior animals are immediately carried by nature towards tho&s;e ob|jects which are adapted to &s;atisfy their in&s;tinctive principles; &s;o men, in the fir&s;t period of their ex|i&s;tence, greedily de&s;ire and &s;eize whatever their appetites or pa&s;&s;ions point out to them as agreea|ble, and con&s;ider it as an injury to withhold from them the indulgence; but &s;uch is the beautiful or|der e&s;tabli&s;hed in the human con&s;titution, that ma|ny of the&s;e propen&s;ities limit and balance each o|ther, &s;o that the immoderate indulgence of one prevents that &s;atisfaction of others, which is al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient of happine&s;s.

and point out, at the &s;ame time, the nece&s;&s;i|ty of regulating their conduct in &s;uch a manner as to prevent their de&s;ires and pur&s;uits from encroach|ing on the equally natural de&s;ires and pur&s;uits of others.</P>

The moral faculty, &s;urveying &s;uch a beautiful and &s;alutary arrangement, &s;anctions it with its approbation, and decrees that every human being is bound to act and to enjoy in conformity to the principles of this &s;y&s;tem. The various relations and circum&s;tances of men being con&s;idered and defined, general max|ims are formed, which are denominated the <HI>laws of nature.</HI> As the human con&s;titution is the work of the &s;upreme Creator, whatever is, by ju&s;t in|ference, deducible from this con&s;titution, as a rule of conduct to man, is as ju&s;tly held to be a divine law, as if the Omnipotent Legi&s;lator had proclaim|ed it with the mo&s;t audible voice.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> The two grand <HI>DIVISIONS</HI> of <HI>RIGHTS</HI> which flow from the Natural <HI>EQUALITY</HI> of <HI>MANKIND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the &s;hort deduction contained in the preceding chapter, joined to what has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the fir&s;t book, it is evident that there are certain <HI>natural rights,</HI> which cannot be infringed, without overturning the foundations of human &s;ociety, and that there are others which be|long only to certain de&s;criptions of men, in con&s;equence of that &s;ocial order which is nece&s;&s;ary for the general felicity. The for|mer are to be con&s;idered as the original conditions of the &s;ocial compact; the latter, as the means by which it is to be executed; and both flow from that idea, of equality of obligation which we have above illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there are certain principles &s;o &s;trongly interwoven with the human frame, &s;o intimately blended with its e&s;&s;ence, &s;o efficient of all that can be called human, that the violation of them cannot be regarded in any other light
<PB N="76" REF="025234_0073_0FCCAE816DE02BD0">
than in that of a degradation, nay, an entire ex|tinction of the di&s;tinctive attributes of the human character. Of con&s;equence, every man &s;tipulates, by entering into &s;ociety with his &s;pecies, that the enjoyments grounded on the&s;e principles, or, in other words, the <HI>rights</HI> which attach to them, as the gifts of God to his rational creatures, &s;hall be maintained to him inviolate; and re&s;erves to him|&s;elf the privilege of defending them at all hazards, whenever it is attempted to wre&s;t them from him. For, as every human being is a con&s;tituent mem|ber of the &s;ocial body, he is, while he di&s;charges the duties incident to his peculiar capacity, enti|tled, equally with every other, to the grand pre|rogatives of human nature, which civil &s;ociety is intended to maintain and improve. He is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of mankind, to the general perfection and felicity, and he contri|butes to it that portion which his abilities enable him to furni&s;h. The rights, therefore, which are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s of each individual, in whatever rank or &s;ituation he may be placed, mu&s;t equally belong to all, and can never &s;uffer the &s;malle&s;t diminuti|on from any claims or prerogatives attached to the di&s;tinctions of fortune, of rank, or of talents. They are the nece&s;&s;ary appendages of that <HI>equa|lity,</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all men amid&s;t the diver|&s;ities
<PB N="77" REF="025234_0074_0FCCAE8307510048">
which &s;ociety and civili&s;ation have intro|duced.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t briefly enumerate and explain the in|herent and original <HI>rights</HI> of human nature, which equally belong to all men without exception; and, &s;econdly, tho&s;e adventitious <HI>rights,</HI> which belong only to particular de&s;criptions of men, as characteri&s;ed, whether by particular talents, or by particular &s;ituations in civil life, but equally to all to whom the&s;e de&s;criptions are applicable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> Of the <HI>ORIGINAL</HI> and <HI>INHERENT RIGHTS</HI> of <HI>HUMAN NATURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. EVERY innocent member of &s;ociety has a <HI>perfect right</HI> to life, and to the integrity of his body. No principle is more deeply engraved in the con&s;titution of all animals, than that of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Every living creature has an ab|horrence of di&s;&s;olution, and a &s;trong aver&s;ion from pain, which is a &s;timulant &s;till more power|ful than the love of plea&s;ure; becau&s;e the remo|val of evil is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards enjoyment. No|thing excites the dete&s;tation of mankind more than an unprovoked attempt on life, or even violent a&s;|&s;ault, when no more is intended than to wound, or to mutilate. Be&s;ides, no man can be u&s;eful to &s;ociety, but in as far as his life is pre&s;erved and &s;e|cured, and bodily health and vigour are nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the mo&s;t important &s;ocial duties. The right to the&s;e is &s;acred and inviolable, and, when|ever they are unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted, every man is en|titled
<PB N="79" REF="025234_0076_0FCCAE86AEA11688">
to defend them even by the &s;laughter of the aggre&s;&s;or, when every other means of &s;ecurity is removed. In this right is evidently included that of the pre&s;ervation of cha&s;tity when attacked.</P>
<P N="2">II. Every man has a <HI>perfect right</HI> to the full fruits of his own hone&s;t ingenuity and labour. The Creator, by be&s;towing on every per&s;on a cer|tain portion of corporeal or mental ability, plain|ly intended that it &s;hould be exerci&s;ed. To this exerci&s;e man are impelled by the &s;timulants of plea&s;ure, and of pain. Rea&s;on, which enables mankind to anticipate futurity, &s;ugge&s;ts, from the recollection of former wants, the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|viding for them when they &s;hall again recur. The natural productions, which may be render|ed &s;ub&s;ervient to the u&s;e of man, nece&s;&s;arily be|come the property of the fir&s;t occupier, becau&s;e, if they were appropriated to none, they would be u&s;ele&s;s to all; at lea&s;t; &s;uch of them as could af|ford no pre&s;ent u&s;e would remain neglect|ed and unimproved. For no man will be&s;tow la|bour and time on that from which he is to receive no profit. Men are &s;trongly affected by a tender &s;olicitude for their offspring and near connections, to whom they wi&s;h to impart a &s;hare of their &s;u|perfluities during life, and, at death, to tran&s;mit their entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. They are inflamed with
<PB N="80" REF="025234_0077_0FCCAE882B816F98">
a thir&s;t of honour and applau&s;e, and eager to ob|tain them by the di&s;play of u&s;eful, of elegant, or of &s;ublime, talents. Be&s;ides, while men mutual|ly &s;upply each other with what they want, for an equivalent, &s;ociety is more clo&s;ely cemented by a con&s;tant interchange of the various products of indu&s;try, of art, and of wealth; and, by the different conditions of men in point of fortune, opportunity is, as above ob&s;erved, afforded for the exerci&s;e of many virtues, which could not other|wi&s;e exi&s;t. Man's double capacity, as an individu|al, and as a member of &s;ociety, is thus be&s;t pre|&s;erved, and his &s;elfi&s;h, as well as his &s;ocial, pro|pen&s;ities are gratified. In fact, the &s;ame means that enable him mo&s;t amply to indulge the former, al&s;o qualify him for &s;atisfying mo&s;t effectually the latter. By the exerci&s;e and cultivation of all his faculties, and by the improvement of the opportu|nities he enjoys, he be&s;t promotes his own private happine&s;s, and, in the &s;ame manner, he contri|butes mo&s;t to the public good. As the perfection and &s;olidity of all the parts of a building produce the &s;olidity and perfection of the whole; &s;o, in hu|man &s;ociety, the pro&s;perity of all its members in their different relations and circum&s;tances, produ|ces the &s;um of general happine&s;s. Notwith&s;tand|ing therefore, the Utopian &s;y&s;tem of a community of goods, which &s;ome political projectors, fixing
<PB N="81" REF="025234_0078_0FCC92A5F634C520">
their eyes on partial views of advantage and in|convenience, have endeavoured to recommend, and &s;ome &s;maller &s;ocieties have exemplified, it is undoubted that both public and private happine&s;s require that the right of property &s;hould be &s;a|credly maintained.</P>
<P>This <HI>right</HI> implies not only that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> lawfully acquired, &s;hould remain the invio|late property of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o that every hone&s;t and fair mean of acquiring &s;hould be equally open to all who are placed in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. It requires that a fair field be granted for the exerci&s;e of every u&s;eful and orna|mental talent, and that its natural rewards be not with held from it. Partial and narrow &s;y&s;tems of policy, whereby the intere&s;t of a few is only con&s;ulted, frequently cramp genius, and re&s;train indu&s;try, to the great prejudice of the common good.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, with whatever pretexts they may be coloured, are ju&s;tly to be accounted viola|tions of the &s;acred right of property, which re|gards not only what men already hone&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;s, but al&s;o, what they may hone&s;tly obtain. The powers of their bodies, and the faculties of their minds, are the only property which men receive
<PB N="82" REF="025234_0079_0FCCAE8BA09A63C8">
from nature. The exerci&s;e of the&s;e on the vari|ous natural productions, introduced the <HI>adventiti|ous</HI> rights to the&s;e objects, and inheritance and contracts transferred them from their original pro|prietors to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. But the foundation of all property is the common <HI>right</HI> to the earth and its productions, which God has granted to man|kind, together with the peculiar appropriation which every one made of &s;ome portion of the&s;e to him&s;elf, by the u&s;e of his mental and corporeal powers. It is ab&s;urd, therefore, that <HI>adventitious</HI> rights &s;hould be &s;acred, while the <HI>primary</HI> means of acquiring the&s;e rights may be wantonly cir|cum&s;cribed.</P>
<P N="3">III. All men have an equal <HI>right</HI> to a fair and hone&s;t character, till it has been proved that they have ju&s;tly forfeited it. The love of character is deeply implanted in the human brea&s;t, and as it can only be extingui&s;hed with the extinction of in|tegrity; &s;o it is &s;trong in proportion to the &s;trength of virtuous and elevated &s;entiments. The lo&s;s of reputation, wounding one of the mo&s;t lively feel|ings of the human heart, is one of the greate&s;t calamities in life. With the lo&s;s of character ma|ny other evils are unavoidably connected, which, while they de&s;troy the private happine&s;s of the individual, al&s;o fru&s;trate his public utility. The
<PB N="83" REF="025234_0080_0FCCAE8CAADD1560">
&s;ucce&s;s of a per&s;on in the world, whether in the improvement of his fortune, or in the exerci&s;e of his abilities, depends greatly on the opinion which is entertained of his integrity. His u&s;efulne&s;s to &s;ociety depends chiefly on the confidence which his fellow men can repo&s;e in him. When any man's hone&s;ty is que&s;tioned, his talents, far from being objects of complacency, are converted into &s;ources of terror, and mankind naturally combine in or|der to deprive them of tho&s;e opportunities of ex|ertion, which &s;eem to threaten their own &s;afety.</P>
<P>Fame, or di&s;tingui&s;hed con&s;ideration and re&s;pect, belong only to eminent abilities, virtues or &s;tations. But the character of hone&s;ty belongs equally to all who faithfully di&s;charge every &s;ocial and civil obligation. Tho&s;e who, in every &s;ituation and circum&s;tance, whether of exaltation or of ob&s;curi|ty, carry along with them purity of heart and in|tegrity of conduct, meet on the equal footing of good men, and are equally entitled to all the en|joyment, advantage, and con&s;ideration, which that character ju&s;tly claims, and cannot fail to po&s;&s;e&s;s, if not clouded by mi&s;repre&s;entation, or &s;tained by calumny. The mo&s;t illu&s;trious abilities, or the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation, give not, of them&s;elves, a better title to a fair and &s;potle&s;s character, than
<PB N="84" REF="025234_0081_0FCCAE8E29EE8EE0">
the mo&s;t moderate parts, or the mo&s;t humble cir|cum&s;tances. This <HI>right,</HI> till it is lo&s;t by vicious action, extends to all conditions and ranks with|out exception.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P N="4">IV. EVERY man has a <HI>perfect right</HI> to <HI>liberty,</HI> or to act in whatever manner he plea&s;es, provided he offers no injury to others, and violates no law enacted by the public authority of the civil &s;ociety to which he belongs. As &s;oon as we form the no|tion of a rational agent, freedom immediately en|ters into the conception, and all happine&s;s and all virtue re&s;t on its foundation. For, as virtue con&s;i&s;ts in the proper u&s;e of all our faculties, or in that conduct which is &s;uited to the human na|ture and condition; &s;o happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e enjoyments, of which nature has rendered us capable, and which the right u&s;e of rea&s;on enables us to obtain. But how can he, who is deprived of the power of regulating his own actions, and of determining and directing his pur&s;uits, either exert his faculties in &s;uch a man|ner as is be&s;t adapted to their ends, or pur&s;ue tho&s;e enjoyments, with the greate&s;t vigour, to which
<PB N="86" REF="025234_0083_0FCCAE9129360898">
he has a&s;&s;igned the highe&s;t value; how can he, who is &s;ubjected to the arbitrary will of another, contribute his portion to the common order and felicity; which re&s;ults from the combined efforts of all directed to this glorious and comprehen&s;ive end&mdash;from the combined exertions of knowledge, wi&s;dom, &s;kill, ingenuity, dexterity, art, labour, re&s;olution, and vigour, &s;hared among all the mem|bers of the &s;ocial body? Suppre&s;s the ju&s;t exertion of any of the&s;e &s;eparate portions, ju&s;t &s;o much is cut off from the general perfection and happine&s;s, and, while individuals are oppre&s;&s;ed, the public &s;uffers. Subject them to the arbitrary will of one, or of a few, all the light, and invention, and ener|gy, which re&s;ult from the free, but well regulat|ed, efforts of all acting in harmonious concert are gone&mdash;all that variety of talent, of de&s;ign, of pur|&s;uit, and of operation, which embelli&s;h, and im|prove, and &s;trengthen, human &s;ociety, is extin|gui&s;hed&mdash;and the whole &s;ocial ma&s;s, &s;ubordinated to one feeble and impotent will, ever influenced by narrow and contracted views, or by cloudy pa&s;|&s;ions, either pines in a pa&s;&s;ive lethargy, or, if it is called into action by extraordinary &s;timulants, exhau&s;ts its &s;trength by its efforts, while their produce is wholly drawn off by the privileged part; &s;imilar to tho&s;e aged trunks on which we behold a few of the higher branches retaining their

&s;ap and verdure, while the tree it&s;elf is rotten, and &s;inking &s;peedily to du&s;t. Thus the pre&s;erva|tion of liberty is nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of pub|lic, as well as of private, felicity; nor can it ever be &s;uppo&s;ed that any human being, who&s;e judg|ment is found, and who has not been corrupted by long habits of &s;ervitude, would either expli|citly or tacitly relinqui&s;h what is nece&s;&s;ary to eve|ry enjoyment of human nature, and without which, &s;ociety it&s;elf is his greate&s;t cur&s;e. In &s;hort, liberty and human nature are in&s;eparable; to de&s;troy the former, is to annihilate the latter &mdash;is to annihilate every notion of duty, and vir|tue, and happine&s;s, beyond what is merely &s;en&s;u|al and bruti&s;h.</P>
<P>It is no wonder then, that the love of freedom &s;hould be &s;trong and vigorous in the brea&s;t, in pro|portion to the elevation of &s;entiment, the &s;en&s;e of honour, the regard for virtue, with which each individual is endowed, and that, by every generous and feeling &s;oul, &s;lavery &s;hould be deem|ed the greate&s;t of human evils. Ba&s;e, indeed, and corrupted, and broken by habits of &s;ervile &s;ubjection, mu&s;t that man be, who can con&s;ider him&s;elf as the property of his fellow creature, and feels no indignation at the tyrant who reduc|es him to this de&s;picable condition, and who, de|grading

the rational creation of God, which he has fir&s;t deba&s;ed in his own &s;oul, outrages heaven while he domineers upon earth. Few of mankind are &s;o degenerate as to have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of liber|ty, and of the native dignity of man. For al|though they may &s;ubmit in &s;ilence to a de&s;pot, yet they abhor him in their hearts: and, when they can do it with &s;afety, would lay hold of the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;haking off the yoke.

With whatever wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s a prince may be endowed, it is impo&s;&s;ible, from the narrowne&s;s of the human mind, that his views can extend to every department of civil &s;ociety; and he will be unavoidably expo&s;ed to impo&s;ition from &s;ome quarter or o|ther. His admini&s;tration, of con&s;equence, can never be marked with that exten&s;ive beneficence, which re&s;ults from forms of go|vernment which are calculated to collect into one point the wi&s;dom, ingenuity, and vigour, which are diffu&s;ed through the whole &s;o|cial body. Be&s;ides, as it is the intention of civil &s;ociety to pro|mote the happine&s;s of all its members, it is impo&s;&s;ible that its ends can be obtained, when the &s;en&s;e of freedom, which is &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial an ingredient of human felicity, is either completely extin|gui&s;hed, or deprived of its enjoyments.</NOTE>.</P>

The freedom which men claim to them&s;elves, they are not willing to grant to others, and the principle which in&s;pires the wi&s;h of independence, produces the exerci&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion. The love of pre-eminence and power rejects competition and equality; fond at|tachment to one's own opinions &s;timulates men to pre&s;cribe them as rules to others; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion con|&s;tantly aims at enlarging its bounds: elevation and authority have a perpetual tendency upwards, and, in their a&s;cent, depre&s;s tho&s;e parts through which they move&mdash;the generality of mankind, long accu&s;tomed to admire &s;plendour and wealth, or eminent talents, readily &s;ubmit to their domi|nion; and voluntary homage often begins the &s;ub|jection, which is at la&s;t exacted as a right.

While all are equally &s;ubject to this authority, and the collective power of the whole community is centered in this point, it fol|lows as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of that equality, which con&s;i&s;ts in the relation that all equally bear to the &s;ocial body, that the actions of each &s;hould be directed and limited by this relation.

In civil &s;ociety, it is this alone that maintains that equality which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all its different members, notwith&s;tanding the diver&s;ities which fortune, rank, or talents, have introduced. For, as the&s;e only diver&s;ify the man|ner in which each is to contribute his portion to the public good; &s;o, when all are equally &s;ubject to common laws, all are levelled by this common &s;ubjection, and every one is re&s;tricted to that line of conduct, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervati|on and welfare of the political &s;y&s;tem. Unlimit|ed freedom is unattainable not only in civil &s;ociety, but in every &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ociation whatever, be|cau&s;e the actions of every individual of the &s;ociety are limited by the actions of all the re&s;t, and by the general de&s;ign and conditions of a&s;&s;ociation it&s;elf.

It is hence incumbent on every one of them, &s;o to regulate his conduct, as to con|tribute to the end propo&s;ed. Nay, perfect liberty, if, by that term, we under&s;tand the unre&s;trained indulgence of every de&s;ire and propen&s;ity, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with the rational con&s;titution of each

As the violator of civil order cea&s;es to be a citizen, and becomes a public enemy, &s;o he who violates the order of the moral and rational nature cea&s;es to be a man, de|generates into a brute, and is the de&s;troyer of his own happine&s;s. As a man, he only is free, who, delivered from the yoke of pa&s;&s;ion, freely follows the dictates of his nobler faculties, and indulges every natural propen&s;ity in con&s;i&s;tency with men|tal order. In like manner, civil &s;ociety is free, when delivered from arbitrary power, in what|ever &s;hape it may exi&s;t, all its members are placed under the empire and dominion of laws, enforcing the grand principles of political union, and equal|ly binding on the legi&s;lators them&s;elves as on the people. If any are rai&s;ed above law, or enjoy privileges and prerogatives, which have no rela|tion to the public good, and are burthen&s;ome to the community, in proportion as they are advanta|geous, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them, the principles of civil union are oppo&s;ed, political equality is &s;ub|verted, and oppre&s;&s;ion, more or le&s;s grievous ac|cording to the degree of &s;uch inequality, is intro|duced.</P>

Men of inferior capacity, or of a meaner turn of mind, will chiefly devote them|&s;elves to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and to &s;elfi&s;h pur&s;uits; and thus with-hold from the public a great deal of benefit which they might otherwi&s;e contribute. On this account, however, they are not to be de|prived of their liberty, as long as they remain within the bounds of that innocence which, how|ever deficient in a moral and religious light, is &s;ufficient for the maintenance of public peace, and

of civil and political order. They are not amen|able to human, but to divine ju&s;tice; and mu&s;t be called to account, not in the pre&s;ent, but in a fu|ture, world.

But to u&s;e violence for this purpo&s;e, is both to di&s;appoint the end, and to exhibit an in&s;tance of that folly which is reprobated in others.

<P>In the right of liberty is included the free u&s;e of private judgment in every thing relative to the regulation of conduct, and e&s;pecially to religion, as well as the free communication of &s;entiment within the bounds above &s;tated. It is vain to think of enjoying liberty of action, if the opini|ons by which action is to be directed are not al&s;o free. In fact, the right of private judgment can|not be alienated or wre&s;ted from any human be|ing by any power on earth. The mind of man, con&s;tituted free by its Creator, will ever remain &s;o, in &s;pite of every endeavour to en&s;lave it. Ig|norance may darken, prejudice re&s;train, or cor|ruption pervert, its powers; &s;till the opinions which it really embraces, are &s;uch, as appear to
<PB N="95" REF="025234_0092_0FCCAE9EE6461498">
it the be&s;t, according to the light which it enjoys. But to conceive any mortal adopting an opinion, for which he perceives no ground, is the mo&s;t glaring contradiction&mdash;is to &s;uppo&s;e him admit|ting and rejecting at once the &s;ame propo&s;itions. With regard to religion, in particular, the right of private judgment, and the freedom of con&s;ci|ence, are to be maintained, as nece&s;&s;arily connect|ed with the equality of all men, above e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. For, although religion ever has been, and ever mu&s;t be, the &s;tronge&s;t bond of &s;ociety, yet the &s;trength of this bond depends on the united evidence of the religious opinions which are adopt|ed, and on the &s;incerity with which they are em|braced. It is only when religious opinions are both true in them&s;elves, and ingenuou&s;ly profe&s;&s;ed, that they can exert any au&s;picious influence on the actions of men.</P>
<P>Now, to perceive truth is the operation of the under&s;tanding. To embrace it with becoming zeal, and to obey its dictates with undeviating con&s;tancy, is the operation of the heart. The under&s;tanding may be enlightened by rea&s;on, the heart may be affected by per&s;ua&s;ion, and, in order that either may be produced, perfect freedom is nece&s;&s;ary. To convince or to per&s;uade by vio|lence, is the greate&s;t of ab&s;urdities, is a manife&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="025234_0093_0FCCAEA02B872C58">
impo&s;&s;ibility; and when there is neither conviction nor per&s;ua&s;ion, where can religion &s;ub&s;i&s;t? Place it where it can only re&s;ide&mdash;in the under&s;tanding and the heart; it eludes all con&s;traint. Remove it from this habitation, it lo&s;es its &s;alutary influ|ence.</P>
<P>As religion, therefore, mu&s;t, from its very na|ture, be free, no man can have any right to dictate to the con&s;cience of another. All men are equally entitled to &s;erve God, and all are equally bound to &s;erve him <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> No man can &s;erve him with another's &s;pirit; and no man can di&s;cern truth with another's under&s;tanding. To &s;ubject religion to con&s;traint, is, of con&s;equence, to de&s;troy its e&s;&s;ence, and to annihilate its &s;alutary tendency. Enthu&s;ia&s;m and bigotry, who&s;e cha|racter it is to erect their own opinions as &s;tandards for all the world, and to violate the rights of con|&s;cience, never fail, if they are &s;ucce&s;sful, to give birth to hypocri&s;y, as the heir to their u&s;urped dominion. Hence it is ea&s;y to account for the &s;mall influence which religious opinions have on the conduct of their profe&s;&s;ors, while pure and un|defiled religion ought naturally to produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects not only in rendering men <HI>wi&s;e unto</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, but in forming them to the practice of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and civil virtue.

is either believed to be &s;omething very different from what it is, to con&s;i&s;t merely in forms and ce|remonies, in which ca&s;e it has either no effect at all on moral conduct, or a very pernicious one&mdash; or men are con&s;trained to profe&s;s what they do not believe; by which their hearts are corrupted, and their actions and &s;entiments are at con&s;tant variance. The glory of God is thus promoted by defacing his image on the human &s;oul, and by transforming his <HI>rea&s;onable &s;ervice</HI> into childi&s;h pageantry and in&s;ignificant pomp. Be&s;ides, if any &s;et of men a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the power of pre|&s;cribing to others in religious matters, others may, with as good a title, do the &s;ame whenever they obtain the power. True religion may thus be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;troyed, without its profe&s;&s;ors having any plea for its defence which is not equal|ly competent to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;tition. While men thus domineer in religious matters, according as they po&s;&s;e&s;s the power, all religious improvement is precluded; the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t pious of men may be obliged to &s;ubmit, in ob&s;e|quious &s;ilence, to the mo&s;t ignorant and impious; and &s;uper&s;tition, in all its hideous forms, is put on the &s;ame footing, and enjoys the &s;ame advantages for its maintenance and propagation, with divine revelation it&s;elf. This right of freedom of judg|ment carries along with it that of free communi|cation
<PB N="98" REF="025234_0095_0FCCAEA3290C5CA0">
of &s;entiment, within the limitations above laid down. As there is in man a &s;trong natural propen&s;ity to communicate his feelings and &s;enti|ments to others, &s;o the faculty by which he is chief|ly enabled to communicate them is one of the mo&s;t powerful bonds of &s;ociety, and one of the chief in|&s;truments of its improvement. By &s;uppre&s;&s;ing this freedom of communication, the natural equality of men is de&s;troyed. Tho&s;e from whom it is wre&s;ted are degraded from the condition of mem|bers of the community, and, being &s;tripped of this privilege, may be prevented from contributing that portion to the public good which it might en|able them to afford. How much the improve|ment and felicity of mankind depend on the free diffu&s;ion of knowledge, is too evident to require any proof. Nor is it le&s;s certain that ignorance and prejudice, ever delighting in darkne&s;s, becau&s;e their Laponian eyes are too weak to endure the light, are extremely de&s;irous of excluding it from whatever quarter it may &s;hine. They endeavour, therefore, violently to extingui&s;h the lamp of rea|&s;on, and to &s;ilence the voice of truth. If they &s;uc|ceed, all the evils of barbari&s;m are perpetuated; if the precious right of free communication of opi|nion is maintained, private as well as public happi|ne&s;s is the re&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="025234_0096_0FCCAEA4AFAA5CB0">But, if men embrace and profe&s;s opinions with regard to religion, morals, or politics, the mo&s;t gro&s;sly fal&s;e and erroneous, are &s;uch &s;y&s;tems to be tolerated, and not rather pro&s;cribed as effron|tive to God, and pernicious to men? The fir&s;t in|quiry mu&s;t be, whether &s;uch opinions tend to over|turn the principles of civil &s;ociety, and to di&s;turb its order and peace.

It is undeniable that bigotry, and &s;uper&s;tition, and enthu&s;ia&s;m, whether religious or civil, have often produced the mo&s;t direful calamities in the world. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that this has entirely proceeded from the principle again&s;t which I am now con|tending, namely, the right of any man to dictate to the con&s;cience of another.

<P>IT is a fal&s;e notion to &s;uppo&s;e that governments are mo&s;t firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed when the liberty of the &s;ubject, or of the citizen, is de&s;troyed.

<P>To this &s;ituation, di&s;mal even in its greate&s;t pre-eminence and &s;plendor, all abu&s;es of power in&s;en&s;ibly lead.

For, when the bodies of men are neither effeminated by luxury, nor en|feebled by climate, nor their minds brutified by ignorance, they cannot fail, &s;ooner or later, to &s;hake off the yoke of tyranny, and to break her &s;ceptre in pieces.

<P N="1">I. Tho&s;e who are placed in the higher &s;tations, and inve&s;ted with offices of government and com|mand, as they owe the di&s;charge of the&s;e impor|tant functions to the public, are entitled, from this very con&s;ideration, to the obedience of tho&s;e who are &s;ubjected to their authority. As mem|bers of the &s;ocial body they are bound to promote its intere&s;t by the mo&s;t effectual means in their power. The peculiar direction of this utility is

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VII. GENERAL INFERENCES</HI> from the <HI>WHOLE</HI> of this <HI>BOOK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now endeavored to enumerate, and e&s;tabli&s;h, as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, the different <HI>rights</HI> that flow from the natural <HI>equality</HI> of men, con&s;idered in its proper light. Some of the&s;e are &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to human happine&s;s, that they cannot be violated without overturning the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety. They are the funda|mental articles of the &s;ocial compact, for the main|tenance of which mankind, if not explicitly, yet tacitly, and by the in&s;titution of civil &s;ociety it&s;elf, have &s;tipulated to relinqui&s;h &s;ome portion of their natural liberty, and to commit, to a certain num|ber of its members, the concentrated power of the community for the benefit of all. Civil &s;ociety annihilates not the natural rights of men, but fen|ces, &s;ecures, and improves them. By circum&s;crib|ing them by the limits which the political union
<PB N="114" REF="025234_0111_0FCCAEB77528DF18">
requires, it conden&s;es, as it were, their e&s;&s;ence, and gives it greater &s;trength and &s;olidity.</P>
<P>Others of the&s;e rights flow, indeed, from the &s;ame principles; but, as they cannot be &s;o pre|ci&s;ely a&s;certained as to e&s;tabli&s;h an exact and defi|nite claim in every particular ca&s;e, they may ad|mit of a le&s;s rigorous ob&s;ervance, without wound|ing the vitals of human a&s;&s;ociation. If tho&s;e of the former cla&s;s con&s;titute the foundations of the &s;ocial fabric, tho&s;e of the latter indicate the means of its con&s;olidation and highe&s;t improvement. When all the&s;e rights are maintained, according to their re&s;pective importance, as far as the hu|man condition will admit, &s;ociety is flouri&s;hing and happy, under whatever form of political ad|mini&s;tration it may be placed. There are, it is true, certain forms of government, which, as their con&s;titution it&s;elf threatens even the mo&s;t impor|tant of them with de&s;truction, are, therefore, e&s;|&s;entially bad. But, there are others which, main|taining the grand prerogatives of human nature, have a direct tendency to advance &s;ocial happine&s;s, though in different degrees. Under &s;uch govern|ments mankind may always con&s;ider it as a fortu|nate circum&s;tance to be placed. That govern|ment
<PB N="115" REF="025234_0112_0FCCAEBA490D2380">
is the be&s;t in which all the inherent rights of human nature are inviolably &s;ecured, legal autho|rity is maintained, and re&s;tricted to its objects, the power of the &s;tate is employed to promote the general happine&s;s; and <HI>inequality</HI> it&s;elf tends to pre&s;erve <HI>equality</HI> of law, and <HI>parity</HI> of obligation, among all the members of the community.</P>

<P>THE divi&s;ion of my &s;ubject, on which I now enter, opens a field comprehending every &s;ocial and civil duty, becau&s;e every duty of this cla&s;s &s;up|po&s;es reciprocal obligations founded on the terms of equality, on which men a&s;&s;ociate. Nay, as in order to di&s;charge the duties we owe to our fellow men, and fellow citizens, it is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train our &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions within ju&s;t bounds; and, as the Divine authority &s;anctions every human obligati|on, and religion is the firme&s;t bond of &s;ociety, the

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> All <HI>MEN,</HI> equally bound to <HI>RESPECT</HI> the <HI>PRIMITIVE RIGHTS</HI> of <HI>HUMAN NATURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the inherent <HI>rights</HI> of human nature are the fundamental articles of the &s;ocial compact, for the maintenance and pre&s;ervation of which civil &s;o|ciety is con&s;tituted, every violation of the&s;e is not only an atrocious injury to the individual who &s;uffers it, but is a direct attack on &s;ociety it|&s;elf. No pre-eminence or prerogative whatever can give a title to deprive an innocent member of the community of tho&s;e rights, without which his exi&s;tence is either precarious or mi&s;erable; and every attempt to infringe them is, on the part of the aggre&s;&s;or, a renunciation of his &s;ocial advan|tages, becau&s;e the&s;e advantages are in&s;eparably connected with the ob&s;ervance of the <HI>rights</HI> now under con&s;ideration. It is to &s;ub&s;titute force in the place of <HI>right,</HI> and, of con&s;equence, to acknowledge that &s;uperior power is entitled to
<PB N="122" REF="025234_0117_0FCCAEC15AE6A090">
make him &s;ubmit in his turn. This principle, carried in every in&s;tance as far as it will go, tears a&s;under every &s;ocial and civil tie, tramples under foot every dictate of ju&s;tice, and introduces a &s;tate of uncea&s;ing ho&s;tility and violence.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;o e&s;&s;ential are &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>rights</HI> to the very exi&s;tence of &s;ociety, that they are fenc|ed and &s;ecured by the &s;tronge&s;t civil &s;anctions. Life and property cannot be directly attacked without expo&s;ing the aggre&s;&s;or to the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalties. But in what a variety of indirect ways may injuries of this nature be offered, without any ri&s;k of human puni&s;hment? Life is de&s;troyed not only by the dagger, or by the bowl, but by with-holding the means of its &s;upport. Life is not &s;o de&s;irable on its own account, as on account of the enjoyments which it furni&s;hes. Property is withdrawn from its lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, not only by robbery, or by theft, but al&s;o by every &s;pecies of unfair commerce. Every deceitful practice, there|fore, whereby advantage is taken, under what|ever colour, of the ignorance or of the nece&s;&s;ity of men, to deprive them of their property with|out an equivalent, is a violation of the right of property, and every oppre&s;&s;ive act which cuts off or dimini&s;hes the means of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, is an attack upon life it&s;elf. To reduce men
<PB N="123" REF="025234_0118_0FCCAEC2AC6835B8">
to the di&s;mal nece&s;&s;ity of dragging out exi&s;tence in mi&s;ery and contempt, to make them cur&s;e the day of their birth, and &s;igh for that of their di&s;|&s;olution, to render the tendere&s;t of nature's ties an aggravation of di&s;tre&s;s; what is this but to &s;pare life in order to perpetuate torment? And to this di&s;mal condition how great a portion of the human race is reduced&mdash;a condition more ab|ject than that of the brute creation, which nature has provided with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of their wants, and given them de&s;ires for nothing more! Shall any rights whatever, derived wholly from political in&s;titutions, founded, for the mo&s;t part, in barbarous ignorance and tyrannic oppre&s;&s;ion, be oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e clear and permanent <HI>rights</HI> which the Creator has conferred on all men equally, by the gift of life it&s;elf, and by the na|tural faculties of providing for its &s;upply! Shall he who cultivates the &s;oil be deprived of an ade|quate &s;hare of the fruits which his indu&s;try pro|duces, and pine in want, while the labour of his hands feeds luxurious idlene&s;s? Shall the <HI>right</HI> of property be e&s;tabli&s;hed only for tho&s;e who contri|bute nothing to the general &s;tock, but con&s;ume and wa&s;te what the indu&s;try of others has provid|ed, and &s;hall that property which nature has be|&s;towed on her children, in the faculties of their
<PB N="124" REF="025234_0119_0FCCAEC5B6D7CF68">
minds and of their bodies, be con&s;idered as a mark of degradation, and a badge of &s;lavery?</P>
<P>How contrary are &s;uch &s;entiments, and the conduct they produce, to that ju&s;t notion of equa|lity above e&s;tabli&s;hed, which repre&s;ents every hu|man being as a con&s;tituent member of the &s;ocial body, and in his peculiar &s;tation, equally nece&s;&s;a|ry, with every other, to the common welfare; which exhibits man to man as children of one com|mon parent, as brethren connected no le&s;s by one common intere&s;t, than by one common origin, and di&s;criminated, by different di&s;tinctions of occupa|tion and place, merely that the general good may be more effectually advanced. For, although &s;uch views of &s;ociety may, by &s;ome who&s;e policy is but half wi&s;dom, be cla&s;&s;ed among the theories of morali&s;ts, or the vi&s;ions of divines, they are the only repre&s;entations that can &s;tand the te&s;t of rea|&s;on, or bear the eye of inquiry.</P>
<P>Equally incumbent, on all men, is the duty to re&s;pect the <HI>right</HI> which every innocent individual has to <HI>character</HI> and <HI>liberty.</HI> But, how little is this duty regarded? Civil laws cannot do &s;o much for the &s;ecurity of the rights, to which it relates, as for tho&s;e of life and property; becau&s;e it is not &s;o ea&s;y to define, in every ca&s;e, their exact extent,
<PB N="125" REF="025234_0120_0FCCAEC736AB4510">
and much more is, on that account, left to the di&s;|cretion and virtue of individuals. That degree of character which is a&s;&s;aulted by open and direct calumny, may, indeed, be always exactly a&s;cer|tained, and every infraction of it become the &s;ubject of legal animadver&s;ion. This is al&s;o the ca&s;e with regard to per&s;onal liberty. But, in how many in&s;tances may a character be ruined, with|out its being in the power of the injured per&s;on to find any legal redre&s;s; and how much may one's ju&s;t liberty be circum&s;cribed and infringed without any ground of legal complaint? The daily con|duct of mankind towards one another, in the&s;e re&s;pects, is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence both of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a civil government, and of its in&s;uffici|ency for the &s;ecurity of human happine&s;s. It manife&s;ts the malevolent propen&s;ities by which mankind are often actuated, and, of con&s;equence, the nece&s;&s;ity of coercive power; and, &s;ince the&s;e evil propen&s;ities bur&s;t out on &s;o many quarters, notwith&s;tanding the authority of laws, this evin|ces the great utility of philo&s;ophical and religious in&s;truction, which applies to the under&s;tanding and the heart, and, by purifying the &s;ource of action, renders conduct more conformable to hu|man nature, and more conducive to human feli|city.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="025234_0121_0FCCAEC8AAA217D0"><HI>Do unto others as you wi&s;h them to do unto you,</HI> is a maxim that an&s;wers every ca&s;e in which we can have any intercour&s;e with our fellow men. It is founded on the equality of human nature, amid&s;t all the diver&s;ities of condition and circum&s;tances. It takes, as the rule of conduct, the feelings of every individual, &s;uppo&s;ing his condition were exchanged with that of the per&s;on towards whom he acts. It could never, therefore, be a ju&s;t &s;tandard, if the &s;ame duties were not equally in|cumbent on all in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Now, with re&s;pect to reputation and liberty, which eve|ry human being &s;o warmly cheri&s;hes, and &s;o ea|gerly pur&s;ues, this rule ought to have peculiar efficacy. Yet, in the&s;e re&s;pects, it is mo&s;t &s;hame|fully and frequently violated. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to ob&s;erve the general aver&s;ion to reproach and cen|&s;ure, and the general propen&s;ity to reproach and cen&s;ure others; the high opinion which mo&s;t peo|ple entertain of them&s;elves, and wi&s;h the world to entertain of them, and their inclination to think ill of others, and to undervalue and dimi|ni&s;h their good qualities. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that, as the experience of di&s;tre&s;s renders men prone to compa&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haud ignara mali mi&s;eris &s;uccurrere di&s;co.</NOTE>, &s;o the love of character, and aver&s;ion from di&s;grace, which operate &s;o
<PB N="127" REF="025234_0122_0FCCAECB0D320958">
powerfully in every human brea&s;t, would render men delicate in inflicting, on others, tho&s;e pains which are &s;o grievous to them&s;elves, and in depri|ving them of tho&s;e &s;atisfactions which they ac|count &s;o delicious. But the&s;e &s;en&s;ations act, un|der the impul&s;e of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in a contrary man|ner. Men think that the reputation of others &s;tands in the way of their own, and that <HI>their</HI> ex|cellence cannot be exhibited unle&s;s tho&s;e inter|po&s;ing eminences be thrown down, and the pub|lic eye wholly fixed on them&s;elves&punc; While <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> are thus employed in levelling each other, no real pre-eminence remains to any, and nothing is di&s;played, to every judicious eye, but one wide extent of malignity and corruption. Every one wi&s;hes his opinion of his neighbour to be believed; and his wi&s;h is granted. But the fulfilment of this wi&s;h equally wounds the characters of all. The blemi&s;hes he di&s;covers in another, or imputes to him, are acknowledged; tho&s;e which another lays to his charge meet with the &s;ame credit. Thus every one by endeavoring to exalt him&s;elf at another's expence, only points out the means of his own depre&s;&s;ion, and, by &s;etting the exam|ple, provokes the re&s;t of mankind to u&s;e them. Such however, is the fa&s;cination of &s;elf-love, that the generality of men &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves ve|ry little obnoxious to cen&s;ure; and, while they
<PB N="128" REF="025234_0123_0FCCAECC8161F930">
are indulging the mo&s;t vicious pa&s;&s;ions of the hu|man heart, envy or revenge, they flatter them|&s;elves with the vain notion that their turpitude is unob&s;erved. As often as I reflect on the preva|lence of detraction, of obloquy, and of &s;lander, I find it difficult to determine whether it proceeds more from weakne&s;s or from malignity; whether it is more an object of contempt or of dete&s;tation. What can be more malignant than to delight in the de&s;truction of one of the deare&s;t of human enjoyments? What more fooli&s;h and ridiculous than for a per&s;on to a&s;&s;ault others, and to &s;uppo&s;e that the attack will not be returned?</P>
<P>The &s;ame ab&s;urdity and inju&s;tice is con&s;picuous in the mutual conduct of men with regard to liber|ty. How few are ready on every occa&s;ion to grant to others the &s;ame freedom which they take to them&s;elves! Such is the &s;pirit of domination univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, that what Pope limits only to one &s;ex, is equally applicable to both&mdash;<HI>the love of plea&s;ure, and the love of power.</HI> Indeed, the one nece&s;&s;arily draws after it the other. The love of plea&s;ure produces the de&s;ire of the means of ob|taining it, and of extending influence and power as far as po&s;&s;ible. For why are men tyrants, but becau&s;e they wi&s;h freely to indulge their inclina|tions, unre&s;trained by ju&s;tice, unlimited by mode|ration?
<PB N="129" REF="025234_0124_0FCCAECDEE88FAA8">
While &s;elf-love, therefore, is the pre|dominant principle of the human heart, tyranny will not be confined to thrones and dominions, to principalities and powers, but &s;pread through e|very &s;phere and condition of life. It is not &s;o much the inclination as the power that is want|ing; and the temper, which is overbearing and unju&s;t in private life, would be a Nero if &s;eated on a throne. Let us only con&s;ider the fond at|tachment which mo&s;t men have to their own opi|nions and mode of life, their eager de&s;ire to im|po&s;e them on others, their impatience of contra|diction, their propen&s;ity to &s;quare the actions of other men by their own rule, their lu&s;t of homage and precedence, their eagerne&s;s to ri&s;e above others, and to indulge their ambition in every lit|tle manner which their &s;phere pre&s;ents to them, their re&s;entment of affronts and injuries, appa|rent as well as real, their &s;elf-conceit and aver&s;i|on from amendment&mdash;we behold the &s;eeds of ty|ranny lurking in almo&s;t every human brea&s;t; and &s;hall cea&s;e to wonder that, when great power is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it &s;hould be &s;o frequently abu&s;ed. How &s;eldom is the freedom of &s;peech and action enjoy|ed even in the free&s;t &s;tates of civil &s;ociety! Let any one recollect what pa&s;&s;es before his eyes every day; let him con&s;ider how often he is obliged to regulate his words, not &s;o much by the internal
<PB N="130" REF="025234_0125_0FCCAED051BD88D0">
&s;entiments of his own heart, as by the opinions and prejudices of tho&s;e with whom he a&s;&s;ociates, and his actions, not &s;o much by the immutable rules of duty, as by the fictitious &s;tandards of the world, and he will confe&s;s that none can enjoy the true freedom of a man, but he who has the fortitude to &s;acrifice to this exalted privilege, his mo&s;t valuable temporal intere&s;ts, and his chief &s;ocial plea&s;ures. Prejudices born of ignorance, or of pride, are nouri&s;hed by education, &s;trength|ened by intere&s;t, or &s;upported by that &s;elf-love which is humbled by the expo&s;ition of them. Cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion have e&s;tabli&s;hed arbitrary rules and forms, which, however contrary to rea|&s;on, it is con&s;idered as unlawful, at lea&s;t, as high|ly ridiculous, to infringe. The man who pre|&s;umes to think, to &s;peak, or to act, differently from the generality, even in matters of &s;ingular importance to the common good, is looked upon as an un&s;ocial &s;avage being, who, &s;eparating him|&s;elf from his &s;pecies, is entitled to no &s;hare of their regard and affection. It is well, if he is not ex|po&s;ed to the &s;evere&s;t effects of re&s;entment and hatred.</P>
<P>Wealth and external dignity, although they can|not of them&s;elves introduce one ray of light into the under&s;tanding, or implant one virtue in the

heart, a&s;&s;ume the privilege of dictating in mat|ters of ta&s;te, of politics, of &s;cience, of morality, and of religion, and of bearing down all who &s;ub|&s;cribe not to their arbitrary decrees. The re&s;|pect due to rank, and the influence which for|tune ju&s;tly claims, every man of &s;en&s;e and of in|tegrity will readily acknowledge and be&s;tow. But that a man's judgment &s;hould be mea&s;ured by his title, or his merit, weighed by his gold; that fortune and rank &s;hould not only po&s;&s;e&s;s their rightful precedence, but al&s;o u&s;urp the honour which is equally due to genius and learning, to wi&s;dom and virtue; that a &s;en&s;ible and hone&s;t man &s;hould not dare to expre&s;s his &s;entiments, be|cau&s;e they are repugnant to tho&s;e of another de|corated with the badges of di&s;tinction, or po&s;&s;e&s;s|ed of a large e&s;tate; is &s;uch a perver&s;ion of na|ture, &s;uch an infraction of liberty, as mankind could never be brought to endure but by tho&s;e habits of &s;ervility which luxurious effeminacy has introduced. It will be an&s;wered, that this free|dom, every man who choo&s;es to u&s;e it, may en|joy. But at what expence? at the expence of in|curring the keene&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of the exalted per&s;on whom he di&s;obliges, and of feeling his power employed to ruin him and his neare&s;t con|nections.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="025234_0127_0FCCAED3EDB6C628">But, why complain of the exorbitant and ty|rannical preten&s;ions of rank and fortune, when genius, which has already &s;ecured fame, frequent|ly exhibits the &s;ame dogmatical and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;pi|rit? How often have tho&s;e, who&s;e literary cha|racter has already attracted the greate&s;t con&s;ide|ration and re&s;pect, u&s;urped a dictatorial power both in conver&s;ation and writing, contradicted without argument, keenly re&s;ented the &s;malle&s;t difference of opinion, even when their &s;entiments were manife&s;tly ab&s;urd, &s;hared out their appro|bation by the mea&s;ure of flattery they received, and inflicted cen&s;ure, not according to per&s;onal or literary merit, but according to the prejudice or di&s;gu&s;t by which they were influenced.

<P>As individuals are actuated by a tyrannical &s;pi|rit, &s;o nations claim to them&s;elves the preroga|tive of reducing to &s;lavery others inhabiting a different climate, or di&s;tingui&s;hed by a different colour of countenance. Ari&s;totle, in that very book where he e&s;tabli&s;hes the grand principles of a free government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Politic. lib. 1 mo.</NOTE>, is not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ert, that the Greeks were de&s;tined, by nature, to rule the other nations of the earth; and founds this right on their &s;uperior genius and civilization. Had that philo&s;opher fore&s;een the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his own country, and that of tho&s;e nations whom he con&s;idered as appointed to continue bar|barians to the end of time, he would have ac|knowledged the futility of his argument. But the nations of Europe, who have exchanged bar|bari&s;m for refinement, have adopted the &s;ame principle, and &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uperiority of art and policy carries along with it the right of oppre&s;s|ing tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tate is &s;till rude and uncultiva|ted. The principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in this E&s;&s;ay &s;uffi|ciently evince that no pre-eminence of &s;agacity, wi&s;dom, ingenuity, or &s;trength can entitle any human being, or any &s;ociety of men, to deprive
<PB N="134" REF="025234_0129_0FCCAED78680F290">
others of the inherent and unalienable rights of human nature.</P>
<P>But, &s;ince principles directly contrary to the&s;e influence the generality of mankind, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety is perfectly conformable. As few men have the courage to &s;acrifice their intere&s;t, their plea&s;ure, or their fame, to their regard for truth and ju&s;tice, the great concern is, to &s;peak and act, not as rea&s;on and virtue dictate, but as intere&s;ted views, in conforming to the opinions, humours, and manners of others, may require. For, how is the favour of the greater part of men to be caught, but by adulation and &s;ervile re&s;|pect? and what &s;o efficacious for incurring their di&s;plea&s;ure, as that manly and generous conduct and conver&s;ation, which indicate le&s;s &s;olicitude to &s;ecure favour than to enjoy &s;elf-e&s;teem, a great|er love of mankind than re&s;pect for individuals? Hence, mo&s;t men have an opinion for every com|pany they frequent, and change their &s;entiments oftener than their dre&s;s. The art of plea&s;ing, reduced into &s;y&s;tem, and practi&s;ed by every one who a&s;&s;umes the character of politene&s;s, has given the &s;ame &s;hape and coloring to the manners of all; and tho&s;e prominent features, which characteri&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;h, are rubbed off by the file of civi|lity and fa&s;hion.

Society is a &s;pecies of &s;tage, on which the actors appear in their turns, and play their parts. The real character remains behind the &s;cenes.

Should an uncivilized &s;on of nature be introduced into our European circles, he would, at fir&s;t, conclude that humanity and benevolence had there fixed their abode.

When men de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e talents and that rank in life which divine providence has allotted them, and a&s;pire at others for which they were never de&s;ign|ed by nature, they aim at &s;ubverting that equali|ty of obligation which a&s;&s;igns particular duties to particular abilities and &s;ituations, and requires them to be an&s;wered by others of a different or|der. For, if every man is at liberty to de&s;ert

the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him, and to invade another's pro|vince, how &s;hall the inferior &s;tations be filled, which are not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the general welfare than the more eminent? If, in the circum&s;tances in which any given number of men can be placed, there be unavoidable hard&s;hips and inconveniences, why &s;hould the&s;e rather be &s;upported by &s;uch as have never been accu&s;tomed to them, and are therefore totally unqualified for their duties, than by tho&s;e whom education, and habit, have be&s;t adapted to &s;uch &s;ituations? Yet, unle&s;s the&s;e inconveniences be endured, the&s;e difficulties en|countered by &s;ome, the &s;tations in que&s;tion mu&s;t be de&s;erted, and a void left in the order of &s;ocie|ty equally pernicious to public and to private in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>Still, men complain of their &s;ituation, and ea|gerly a&s;pire to others more exalted! But, is there any real foundation for this di&s;content, for this re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of change? Is it, as people pretend, that their pre&s;ent condition is more painful, more adver&s;e to virtue, more inau&s;picious to the devel|opment and exerci&s;e of their powers, than tho&s;e which they &s;o fondly de&s;ire? Or is it that men are better acquainted with the difficulties and temptations of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, than with tho&s;e of any other, have fondly magnified their
<PB N="139" REF="025234_0134_0FCCAEDF2FF2B050">
own abilities, and ignorantly placed all excellence in the di&s;charge of the duties of &s;uperior &s;tations? If we examine the ca&s;e with impartial attention, we &s;hall find no rea&s;on to he&s;itate in determining the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Men readily grant the complaints of tho&s;e who are placed above them to be ill founded, and a&s;cribe their di&s;&s;atisfaction to their folly. They ha&s;tily pre&s;ume that, if they were fixed in their &s;ituation, they would ea&s;ily &s;urmount its difficul|ties, re&s;i&s;t its temptations, and fully di&s;charge its duties. Their inferiors pronounce the &s;ame judg|ment with regard to them and their circum&s;tances, and, if they envy, they are envied in their turn. A convincing proof this, that, in every conditi|on, there are advantages as well as difficulties; that, though none is exempted from inconvenience, none is ab&s;olutely in&s;upportable; and that di&s;con|tent with a pre&s;ent &s;tation, and impatient de&s;ire of a higher, proceed from mi&s;taken notions of both.</P>
<P>I beg that it may be con&s;idered that I am, at pre&s;ent, &s;peaking only of the different ranks and &s;ituations of human &s;ociety, as they are diver&s;ified for the common happine&s;s of mankind; and not of tho&s;e &s;ingular conditions of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery,
<PB N="140" REF="025234_0135_0FCCAEE122F81E30">
which fall to the lot of individuals. In the&s;e, pa|tience and fortitude may be recommended as du|ties and as con&s;olations; but contentment can hard|ly be required.</P>
<P>But, in &s;urveying the different &s;tations of life, although men grant that there are difficulties and hard&s;hips in all of them, they &s;till believe that the&s;e dimini&s;h in proportion to the degree of ele|vation; and fall, with the greate&s;t weight, on tho&s;e who occupy the lowe&s;t places. They fond|ly imagine, that, if they could a&s;cend to a con&s;i|derable height, they &s;hould there find &s;ome agree|able &s;pot, where, unmole&s;ted and compo&s;ed, they might &s;urvey the &s;teep which they had climbed, and enjoy the delightful pro&s;pect opened around them. But, they reflect not on the difficulty of the a&s;cent, on the giddine&s;s of the &s;ituation, or, if they &s;hould chance to &s;lip, on the &s;everity of the fall. The pre&s;&s;ure of corporeal wants, the burden of daily labour, and the humiliation of contempt, con&s;titute the primary pains of a poor and ignoble condition. It is further deprived of the enjoyments which re&s;ult from the cultivation of rea&s;on, and of the other nobler faculties of the &s;oul, and is con&s;trained to toil amid&s;t the darkne&s;s of ignorance. If tho&s;e, to who&s;e &s;hare it falls, feel for the mi&s;eries of others, they are de&s;titute
<PB N="141" REF="025234_0136_0FCCAEE22FCFAB78">
of the means of relieving them, and mu&s;t &s;uffer the pangs of compa&s;&s;ion, without the divine &s;ati&s;|faction of beneficence.

<P>They con&s;ider not, however, that the plea&s;ures of life depend not &s;o much on the externals of condition as on the di&s;po&s;itions of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; that what &s;eems calculated to &s;atisfy, and to limit, de&s;ire, &s;erves often to inflame and extend it; that the enjoyments which are in men's power are not tho&s;e which they really ta&s;te; and that to wi&s;h and to pur&s;ue is the uncea&s;ing employment of man upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">arth.

In like manner, no moderare exaltati|on in the &s;cale of &s;ociety can &s;atisfy men, who&s;e ambition is kindled, and who&s;e activity engaged.

It is a gro&s;s mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that to provide for one's family by a&s;&s;idu|ous and hone&s;t labour, is le&s;s meritorious than to &s;upply the poor out of an opulent fortune; that patience is le&s;s commendable than genero&s;ity, re|&s;ignation than munificence, meekne&s;s, than mode|ration, contentment than conde&s;cen&s;ion; that &s;o|ciety is le&s;s benefited by being furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, than by being adorned with the

God ac|cepts no le&s;s the artle&s;s devotion of the grateful, though unin&s;tructed, heart, than the copious and &s;welling prai&s;es of the enlightened under&s;tanding. The coar&s;er and brawny mu&s;cles are as nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of the body, as the organs of the mo&s;t delicate texture.</P>
<P>It is thus evident, that real happine&s;s and virtue are not limited to any &s;tation, but are equally open to all. If there is any exception to this conclu|&s;ion, it mu&s;t be in favor of the middling &s;pheres of life&mdash;in which neither power and opulence tempt to oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners, nor poverty and ignorance lead to fraud and violence; in which neither pride hardens the &s;oul, nor &s;ervi|lity deba&s;es it; in which the be&s;t enjoyments of life are offered, and its greate&s;t enticements to cor|ruption excluded.</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it clearly appears, that as it is the duty, it is equally

the intere&s;t of all who are placed in the inferior ranks of life, to di&s;charge, with diligence and a&s;|&s;iduity the humble offices of their &s;tation, to cul|tivate contentment with their lot, and to &s;uppre&s;s the emotions of envy towards tho&s;e who are more exalted.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the de&s;ire of ri&s;ing is one of the mo&s;t powerful motives to the hone&s;t and active di&s;charge of every &s;ocial duty, that one great point of equality among men con&s;i&s;ts in the opportunity which all ought to enjoy of ex|erci&s;ing their u&s;eful or elegant abilities, and that, if every one is to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the condition in which his birth or his circum&s;tances have plac|ed him, exertion mu&s;t be di&s;couraged, and the general welfare be deprived of the benefit which re&s;ults from hone&s;t and generous ambition. We have, moreover, &s;hown above, that frequent ex|change of ranks and conditions &s;eems to compo&s;e a part of the divine admini&s;tration of human af|fairs.

<P N="1">I. THE de&s;ire of improving one's circum|&s;tances ought never to lead to encroachment on the rights of others, whether natural or acquired. By the violation of the former, the fundamental principles of &s;ociety are &s;ubverted; and, by that of the latter, the order nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence, is de&s;troyed. Whoever, therefore, pretends to maintain any of the natural rights of man, by overturning that &s;ubordination and ju&s;t order, which is the &s;oul and the life of &s;ociety, defeats the very purpo&s;e which he has in view, and exhibits either egregious folly or egregious wickedne&s;s. In either ca&s;e, he becomes a dangerous enemy to the public intere&s;t, who is to be re&s;trained and puni&s;hed, to prevent him both from injuring others by his practice, and corrupting them by his exam|ple. Such, however, is the intemperance of hu|man
<PB N="149" REF="025234_0144_0FCCAEF0EDC05378">
pa&s;&s;ions, even tho&s;e of the mo&s;t generous kind, when they are &s;trongly excited, that the ardor of liberty, and indignation at oppre&s;&s;ion, often hurry men to pur&s;ue a conduct directly re|pugnant to the principles of equity and beneficence which they profe&s;s&mdash;to oppre&s;s others when they are contending for freedom; to be mo&s;t iniquit|ous in defence of ju&s;tice; and, with a view to pro|mote the welfare of &s;ociety, to overturn its foun|dations. Let the times in which we live, declare, in many in&s;tances, the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P N="2">II. The duties of the &s;tation, which people al|ready occupy, ought to limit their endeavors af|ter advancement. The co-operation of every in|dividual for the public good, mu&s;t fir&s;t di&s;play its energy in the &s;phere in which he moves, and be thence tran&s;mitted to the other parts of the &s;oci|al body. By neglecting the duties of his pre&s;ent &s;tation, a per&s;on with-holds the portion he is ap|pointed to contribute to the general welfare, and, by encroaching on the province of others, may clog their exertion and fru&s;trate their utility. To arrive at a more agreeable or more honorable &s;ta|tion, the faithful di&s;charge of the duties of a pre|&s;ent one ought always to be the fir&s;t means em|ployed. When the&s;e are fulfilled, every fair and hone&s;t exertion is not only lawful, but even high|ly
<PB N="150" REF="025234_0145_0FCCAEF20344CAC0">
laudable, as the greate&s;t activity of the parts then advances more effectually the pro&s;perity of the whole. By embracing the opportunities which occur, and by exerci&s;ing the talents with which men are endowed, they manife&s;t their gra|titude to Providence, and they improve its gift to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P N="3">III. The duties of any &s;tation to which men a&s;pire, and their own ability to di&s;charge them, ought to be con&s;idered before they attempt to ob|tain it. For, to occupy a &s;tation for which one has no capacity, or with the duties of which he is totally unacquainted, is both to expo&s;e his own folly, and to injure &s;ociety, by betraying a tru&s;t which is committed to him. Hence, it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to acquire a complete know|ledge of our own talents and qualities, which the generality of mankind are &s;o apt to magnify, both to their own di&s;grace, and to the detriment of others. Inability to di&s;charge the duties of any &s;tation, re&s;ulting whether from narrowne&s;s of under&s;tanding, from unhappine&s;s of temper, or from infirmity of body, &s;hould be deemed an ex|pre&s;s declaration of the Divine will again&s;t the acquirement of it, and, of con&s;equence, a boundary not to be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="151" REF="025234_0146_0FCCAEF42E636590">IV. Men's exertions to improve their conditi|on &s;hould be influenced by the con&s;ideration of the enlargement, or the contraction, of their utility. From the light in which every man appears as a member of human &s;ociety, to who&s;e benefit he is bound to contribute in the mo&s;t ample manner po&s;&s;ible, it is plain that it can never be lawful for any one to change his pre&s;ent &s;ituation for ano|ther, in which his utility mu&s;t be impaired. This is to prefer private to public intere&s;t, to pervert the quality of member, to demand more than is compen&s;ated, and to lo&s;e all that dignity and real enjoyment which re&s;ult from the mo&s;t exten&s;ive beneficence.</P>
<P>If, in the &s;tation de&s;ired, men may be equally u&s;eful, as in that which they occupy, private in|tere&s;t may be allowed its full force. If, together with advancement, opportunities of utility increa&s;e, every private and public con&s;ideration happily unites in &s;timulating to the pur&s;uit of it, and every generous heart will wi&s;h and applaud the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus, the rights of others, the duties of a pre|&s;ent &s;tation, the talents requi&s;ite for a higher, and the more exten&s;ive utility, are the limits within which men ought to confine their exertions for the improvement of their circum&s;tances. Thus,
<PB N="152" REF="025234_0147_0FCCAEF5A9CE2218">
ju&s;tice, diligence, ability, and public &s;pirit, &s;hould be the con&s;tant attendants in the path of advance|ment, and the chief forwarders of the progre&s;s.</P>
<P>But, how little are the&s;e con&s;iderations regard|ed! When intere&s;t or plea&s;ure are con&s;tituted the &s;ole &s;prings of action, every duty that has no ten|dency to advance their ends is neglected, and of|fices, in&s;tituted for the benefit of mankind, are &s;hamefully perverted to their prejudice. When the project is formed of ri&s;ing to preferment without regard to merit, birth, intere&s;t, or party-attachments, are the only valid grounds of pre|ten&s;ion. To the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are &s;acrificed. Be|fore children can di&s;cover either inclination or ca|pacity, offices are de&s;igned for them, and kept con&s;tantly in view; nor were this to be cen&s;ured, if proper care were taken to give them a &s;uitable education, and their de&s;tination changed, when their temper and talents were perceived to be in|compatible with it. But the&s;e things are &s;eldom much con&s;idered. Whatever be the genius or im|provements of the per&s;on in que&s;tion, he mu&s;t move in the particular &s;phere which has been cho|&s;en for him. The public welfare is treated as a chimera, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a man well &s;kil|led in the ways of the world to u&s;e as a color to
<PB N="153" REF="025234_0148_0FCCAEF799868008">
varni&s;h the mo&s;t intere&s;ted de&s;igns, but which none, but an enthu&s;ia&s;tic or vulgar mind, can think of adopting as a real object of pur&s;uit. When the public welfare, however, is ob&s;tructed, private happine&s;s cannot long be enjoyed. For, as one chief cau&s;e of the di&s;order and corruption, which &s;o often lay wa&s;te civil &s;ociety, is the little atten|tion which is &s;hown to adapt men's condition to their abilities and tempers; &s;o the mi&s;ery of in|dividuals frequently &s;prings from the &s;ame &s;ource. Men moving in a &s;phere for which they were ne|ver de&s;igned by nature, &s;oon grow di&s;gu&s;ted with their lot, and, finding the duties of their &s;tation irk&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive, either neglect them alto|gether, to their own irretrievable di&s;grace, or continue to di&s;charge them, in &s;uch a manner as is equally painful to them&s;elves, and detrimental to others. Thus, Divine Providence takes ven|geance on mankind for infringing its appointments, by allowing them to be bewildered in their errors, and the victims of their own infatuation.</P>

<P>IT is certainly no ea&s;y matter for a per&s;on not to con&s;ider him&s;elf as greatly &s;uperior to the re&s;t of his &s;pecies, when every one of tho&s;e who &s;ur|round him pretends that his honor and dignity, his plea&s;ure and &s;ervice, are the only objects which occupy him&s;elf, and ought to occupy every other; when every one applauds, with &s;ervile adulation, his mo&s;t in&s;ignificant &s;ayings, and mo&s;t ridiculous actions, and adores him as the &s;ource of wi&s;dom, and the centre of power. When a per&s;on has &s;o many occa&s;ions of beholding his fellow men in a contemptible light, it mu&s;t require angelic mode|ration to ab&s;tain from treating them accordingly; to neglect tho&s;e advantages which his circum&s;tan|ces and their &s;ervility put into his hands for gra|tifying his own pa&s;&s;ions and caprice, at the ex|pence of their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="025234_0150_0FCCAEFA2D67CF50">When, therefore, I con&s;ider this &s;tate of things, far from being &s;urpri&s;ed at the pride, and impa|tience of contradiction, which often characteri&s;e the higher ranks of life, or any &s;pecies of di&s;tinc|tion and eminence, I am more di&s;po&s;ed to admire the conde&s;cen&s;ion and humanity which they &s;o frequently exhibit. For, the&s;e vices, though more ob&s;ervable in the higher &s;pheres, becau&s;e they are di&s;played in a more con&s;picuous point of view, are by no means confined to the&s;e, but pervade every rank, every &s;ituation and profe&s;&s;ion of life. Hardly any attainments &s;o low, any circum&s;tances &s;o cir|cum&s;cribed, as not to afford &s;cope for &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and o&s;tentation. Who will not &s;eem great, if he is as highly exalted as his ideas of greatne&s;s reach, and compares him&s;elf only with his inferiors: if he e&s;timates his own knowledge by another's igno|rance, his own wi&s;dom by another's folly, his own power by another's impotence, his own wealth by another's poverty, his own virtue by another's depravity? On what other foundation, than on this partial mode of compari&s;on, are built the pride and arrogance of even the mo&s;t exalted of mankind? But, if we abandon this magical gla&s;s, which transforms the cottage into a palace, and the infant into a man, and contemplate objects in the true light of nature, we &s;hall find, that the great di&s;pute only is, who &s;hall be e&s;teemed the

By feeding the hungry, does any man &s;poil his own appetite? By relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, does he dimini&s;h his own reli&s;h of ea&s;y circum&s;tances?

<P>Thou proud in&s;olent mortal! who looke&s;t down from thy lofty &s;tation on thy brethren of men, and imagine&s;t them only formed to bring their gifts to thy altar, and to bend before thee with &s;ervile homage, know that thy elevation only renders thee more con&s;picuou&s;ly contemptible! Con&s;ider that, &s;hould tho&s;e, whom thou &s;o in&s;o|lently de&s;pi&s;e&s;t, adopt thy principles, and bur&s;t the bands of &s;ocial union by which alone they are made thy dependents, the power is theirs, and thine only the &s;hadow and the phantom. Should they only withdraw their &s;upport without inflict|ing any po&s;itive evil, thou would&s;t precipitately &s;ink into a degradation lower than that of the meane&s;t laborer. Le&s;s inured to want, thou would&s;t be le&s;s able to provide for its &s;upply, and have le&s;s rea&s;on to expect it from the benignity of others. Con&s;ider that, even in thy pre&s;ent
<PB N="169" REF="025234_0164_0FCCAF15289B9588">
elevation, thou art really more dependent than the mo&s;t ignoble of the &s;ons of men. If he is lea&s;t dependent who &s;tands lea&s;t in need of others, he is &s;urely mo&s;t dependent who &s;tands mo&s;t in need of them. With our rank, our nece&s;&s;ities, our demands, our cares, increa&s;e. The links by which we are joined to our fellow men are multiplied, and the very circum&s;tance which en|larges our influence dimini&s;hes our internal &s;trength. He, therefore, who has the greate&s;t number of dependents, has only the greate&s;t num|ber of tho&s;e to whom he is indebted for con&s;ide|ration and power. The more lofty and &s;pacious the edifice is, with the greater precipitation, if its pillars are &s;apped, does it ru&s;h into ruin. Learn then to &s;eek thy importance and dignity, where only thou wilt find them, by di&s;charging every duty which thy &s;tation requires, and by diffu&s;ing, by thy affability and beneficence, happine&s;s among mankind. Relinqui&s;hing the phantoms of pride enjoy the &s;ub&s;tantial pre-eminence of virtue.</P>
<P>But ye! who employ your di&s;tingui&s;hed abili|ties, or exalted power, for the purpo&s;es for which Providence has be&s;towed them, fear not that any portion of that re&s;pect, obedience, and honor, to which you are entitled, will be withdrawn. Goodne&s;s, moving in an elevated &s;phere, and

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VI. DUTIES</HI> common to <HI>ALL</HI> with regard to the <HI>USE</HI> of their <HI>OPPORTUNITIES</HI> and <HI>TALENTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER attentively examines the human con&s;titution will di&s;cover in it &s;everal incon&s;i&s;ten|cies not &s;o ea&s;ily accounted for. Thus, mankind have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;ociety, and are mi&s;e|rable without it; yet in &s;ociety they are prone to indulge the mo&s;t un&s;ocial di&s;po&s;itions. Nature con|&s;tantly draws them to their &s;pecies, and points out their &s;weete&s;t enjoyments, as &s;olely derivable from this &s;ource; yet the &s;elfi&s;h part of our frame, coun|teracting this dictate of nature, corrupts the grand &s;treams of happine&s;s, by turning them into its own channel, and, in&s;tead of allowing the individual to act as a member of the &s;ocial body, and to receive from this capacity his highe&s;t dignity and enjoy|ment, endeavours to render &s;ociety &s;ub&s;ervient to the individual. There is in all men a wonderful
<PB N="172" REF="025234_0167_0FCCAF1B2E11CED8">
fondne&s;s of independence, and a no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing de&s;ire of the &s;ervice and re&s;pect of others. This is, in fact, to join the greate&s;t contradictions, to force in|to union things ab&s;olutely incompatible; for inde|pendence can only be &s;ecured, by an entire &s;epa|ration from mankind, by relinqui&s;hing every claim to their good offices and regards, by renouncing every &s;ocial enjoyment, and by deriving happi|ne&s;s from the &s;tores of &s;elf. As &s;oon as man en|ters into the &s;ocial circle, and &s;hares its beneficial influences, he relinqui&s;hes his &s;eparate exi&s;tence, and, forming a part of a &s;y&s;tem, is limited by the relations which he bears to the other parts, and to the whole, becomes bound to contribute to their &s;upport and perfection, according to the &s;up|port and benefit which he receives from them, and is required to exert a beneficial activity pro|portioned to the influence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Whoever with-holds from the general good any portion of u&s;eful effort he is able to be&s;tow, is unfaithful to the conditions, on which he enjoys the benefits of &s;ociety, and violates that equality of obligation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all mankind. He al&s;o fru&s;|trates, as far as lies in his power, that plan of Di|vine wi&s;dom, whereby the general felicity is in|tended. For it is certain that the Univer&s;al Pa|rent has di&s;tributed among men &s;uch a portion of abilities and powers, as, duly cultivated and im|proved,
<PB N="173" REF="025234_0168_0FCCAF1CB0E75538">
would render the condition of all com|fortable, in every re&s;pect, and happy. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, &s;ome are, indeed, over|burthened with labour, and enjoy but a &s;mall de|gree of convenience; while others loiter in indo|lence, and con&s;ume the fruits of indu&s;try. This, however, could never be the ca&s;e, did every one cultivate with diligence his peculiar talents, and di&s;charge the duties of his peculiar &s;tation. It is the neglect of this alone that makes it nece&s;&s;ary to overload &s;ome, in order to &s;upport that part of the common burden, from which others have treacherou&s;ly withdrawn them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Hence the principle of <HI>equality,</HI> above illu&s;trat|ed, requires not only that all men &s;hould religi|ou&s;ly regard the rights of others, but that they &s;hould exert them&s;elves, to the utmo&s;t of their ability, for the common benefit. Whoever re|jects this requi&s;ition de&s;cends below the rank of a member of &s;ociety, and, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing, as is fooli&s;hly &s;uppo&s;ed, above the re&s;t of mankind, by a life of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, degrades him&s;elf to the condition of a begger, who lives on the la|bour of others, without making any ju&s;t return for it. For, however &s;trange it may &s;ound, it is undoubted, that &s;ociety has a right to the be&s;t exertion of all its members, of the highe&s;t as well
<PB N="174" REF="025234_0169_0FCCAF1F501EFBD0">
as of the lowe&s;t, of the mo&s;t opulent as well as of the poore&s;t, for the common good.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not, what advantage every in|dividual is content to reap from his own powers and opportunities, but what degree of general u|tility he can effectuate. The&s;e powers have not been be&s;towed on him, by their divine author, &s;olely for his own u&s;e, but chiefly for the benefit of the human race, to who&s;e happine&s;s he is de&s;|tined to contribute. This proper exerci&s;e of the powers of every individual all the other members of &s;ociety have a right to demand, on fair and equal terms. The equivalent every individual ob|tains by the advantages and comforts which he receives from &s;ocial life, and &s;till more by that &s;u|perfluity which enables any one to live in &s;loth. He is a debtor to the grand community of man|kind, and his creditors can call him to repay.</P>
<P>It is true that, &s;ince it is &s;o difficult to deter|mine the extent of every one's capacity, and the exact mea&s;ure of the &s;ocial advantages he enjoys, no preci&s;e claim can be e&s;tabli&s;hed in every parti|cular ca&s;e. But, the general obligation remains equally &s;trong on all, and none can wilfully vio|late it without incurring the blame of his own mind, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of the author of his ex|i&s;tence.
<PB N="175" REF="025234_0170_0FCCAF2089384290">
The principle, therefore, on which &s;ome ancient legi&s;lators prohibited any citizen, of what|ever condition or rank, from living in idlene&s;s, was perfectly ju&s;t in it&s;elf, although the execution of any law grounded upon it mu&s;t ever be ex|tremely difficult, and might occa&s;ion greater in|conveniences than tho&s;e which it &s;hould be intend|ed to obviate.</P>
<P>As indolence, and the neglect of opportunities of utility, are highly unju&s;t, &s;o they are extreme|ly contemptible. For, what character can be more the object of contempt, than that of a per|&s;on who, though endowed with active powers, and furni&s;hed with ample opportunities of benefit|ing that particular &s;ociety to which he belongs, and from which he receives con&s;tant defence and protection, yet lives on the labour either of his predece&s;&s;ors or contemporaries, without te&s;tifying any approbation of their indu&s;try, by which he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, or making any efforts to imitate their laudable example? What can degrade a man more in his own eyes, than the con&s;ideration that he has done nothing to benefit his friends, to o|blige his neighbours, to educate and e&s;tabli&s;h his children, or to promote the intere&s;t and honour of his country; that he has buried his talents, de|feated the end of Providence in be&s;towing them,
<PB N="176" REF="025234_0171_0FCC92AD96AF1D18">
and that, when he is cut off by death, the world will be delivered from an unnece&s;&s;ary burden, from a putrid excre&s;cence?</P>
<P>On the other hand, what can convey, to any per&s;on, a higher idea of his own worth and im|portance, than the reflection that, though but an individual endowed with one cla&s;s of abilities, yet, by their improvement, he not only enlarges his own enjoyments, but diffu&s;es around him the mo&s;t joyous influences, and promotes the welfare of the whole human race; that, though retired from public view, he appears in the u&s;eful productions of his application and genius; that, though infirm in body, he renders, by his inventions, the labour of the &s;trong and hardy both more ea&s;y to them|&s;elves, and more beneficial to others; and that, though devoid of public authority, he &s;trength|ens the political union, and advances public order by the ju&s;t principles which he e&s;tabli&s;hes and elu|cidates; that, taking another view of the ca&s;e, though ignorant and illiterate, yet he contributes, by his toil and dexterity, to the in&s;truction and improvement of mankind, while he provides &s;u&s;|tenance and lei&s;ure for tho&s;e who are endowed with genius and learning, or placed in tho&s;e &s;ta|tions where plans of general welfare can be be&s;t conceived, and propo&s;ed with the greate&s;t pro&s;|pects
<PB N="177" REF="025234_0172_0FCCAF24E9B21668">
of &s;ucce&s;s? In fine, it is an exalting con&s;ider|ation, that, however ob&s;cure a per&s;on is in him|&s;elf, he is an in&s;trument in the hand of Providence for communicating to mankind, not only the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, but al&s;o its highe&s;t ornaments and delights, and even of rai&s;ing their views a|bove this terre&s;trial abode, and directing them to a &s;tate of endle&s;s felicity, the certainty of which cannot fail to produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects on every part of their conduct. No per&s;on is &s;o mean and in&s;ignificant, as not to affect &s;ome part of the community. In a grand piece of machinery, the &s;maller wheels and pins, though le&s;s ob&s;ervable, are not on that account le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than others to the ju&s;t motion an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect of the whole. In like manner, the conduct of the inferior members of &s;ociety not only affects their own happine&s;s, or that of their immediate connections, but diffu&s;es its influence, though in a le&s;s perceptible manner than that of the higher ranks, through the whole &s;ocial body. Nay, I may a&s;&s;ert that, as the&s;e compo&s;e the greater part of the community, their u&s;eful indu&s;try is &s;till more requi&s;ite to the general happine&s;s, and that the meane&s;t labourer, who diligently and hone&s;tly exerts him&s;elf in his &s;phere, is entitled to &s;hare, with the mo&s;t exalted of the &s;ons of men, the glorious appellation of the friend of mankind, and of the approved of God! Should
<PB N="178" REF="025234_0173_0FCCAF2680951FC8">
any whom fortune depre&s;&s;ed, or in&s;olence laughs to &s;corn, but who&s;e &s;oul, ri&s;ing above his &s;ituation, feels the intrin&s;ic dignity of man, and laments the nar|rowne&s;s of his terre&s;trial &s;phere, ca&s;t his eye on the&s;e pages, let him be comforted and &s;trengthen|ed by the reflections above mentioned. There is &s;omething in the idea that exalts the mind, that kindles the de&s;ire of u&s;efulne&s;s, that rou&s;es activi|ty, and puts every faculty in motion. When we con&s;ider it, we &s;eem de&s;irous of breaking the in|glorious chains of indolence, and pant for &s;ome worthy object, &s;ome important pur&s;uit, to exerci&s;e the generous energies of the &s;oul!</P>
<P>If the con&s;ideration of the importance of the meane&s;t member of &s;ociety &s;hould prove a &s;trong argument to u&s;eful diligence, how much greater force mu&s;t this argument acquire with regard to tho&s;e whom fortune and rank particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;h&punc; Their influence, either good or bad, is very exten&s;ive. Fir&s;t communicated to nume|rous connections and dependents, it is conveyed through them to other contiguous relations, till it reach at la&s;t the extremities of the &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem. Were this influence always of a beneficial nature, &s;ociety would feel its &s;alutary effects through all its frame, and, in&s;tead of that di&s;tempered and deformed face which it &s;o frequently wears, would
<PB N="179" REF="025234_0174_0FCCAF29ECC63C08">
a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t healthy and &s;miling a&s;pect. The face of nature, long hid in fog, or ravaged by tempe&s;ts, receives not a more delightful transfor|mation from the returning &s;un, than &s;ociety would receive from tho&s;e benignant lights which thus illumined and invigorated it.</P>
<P>In what light, then, mu&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons appear, who, becau&s;e their external circum&s;tances free them from the nece&s;&s;ity of labouring for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, imagine them&s;elves exempted from eve|ry &s;pecies of u&s;eful exertion; who, becau&s;e they are provided with the abundant &s;upply of every corporeal want, think them&s;elves under no obli|gation to improve their minds, or to engage in any pur&s;uit conducive to the common welfare; who either yawn away their time in the mo&s;t le|thargic indolence, or devote it to the mo&s;t in&s;igni|ficant, frivolous, or vicious enjoyments; who wa&s;te ingenuity in mere o&s;tentation, degrade rea|&s;on to purvey for appetite, and make recreation their &s;tudy, and amu&s;ement their bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;in a word, who&s;e whole life is either a blank, or a per|ver&s;ion of exi&s;tnece. The phantom of plea&s;ure, like an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> in&s;tantly di&s;appears, when they think they can &s;eize it. The &s;ame in&s;ipid round is run over a thou&s;and times. The &s;en&s;es are jaded, the appetites cloyed. Tired at la&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="025234_0175_0FCCAF2AE8EE7C30">
with the tedious pur&s;uit, tho&s;e votaries of plea|&s;ure, like the top that has long been la&s;hed, do&s;e in the arms of indolence. When they wake at times from their in&s;en&s;ibility, their minds are haunted with all the chimeras, all the mon&s;ters of vapour and &s;pleen, which often drive them to bur&s;t, by death, the ponderous fetters with which they are loaded.</P>
<P>I will not a&s;&s;ert, that all who live in this man|ner are &s;en&s;ible of the criminality of their con|duct, and perceive that, however aver&s;e from inju&s;tice, breach of tru&s;t, and cruelty in their dealings with particular per&s;ons, they yet involve them&s;elves, by this negative vice, this neglect of the due improvement of their talents and oppor|tunities in the&s;e crimes with re&s;pect to their &s;pe|cies in general. No; I am convinced that, if they clearly perceived the tendency of their con|duct, many of them, at lea&s;t, would review it with &s;orrow and di&s;gu&s;t. Ignorance, and wrong habits contracted in early life, more than any vicious di&s;po&s;ition, are the cau&s;es of a cour&s;e of action &s;o di&s;graceful and unhappy to them&s;elves, and &s;o detrimental to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This reflection, however, if it dimini&s;h their criminality, augments the folly of neglecting to
<PB N="181" REF="025234_0176_0FCCAF2D40407BD0">
cultivate tho&s;e rational faculties, which would afford them ju&s;t notions of their duty, and di&s;clo&s;e an elevated region of pur&s;uit and happine&s;s. For, if they rightly apprehended the relation in which all the members of &s;ociety &s;tand to each other, they would perceive that it is not only the rapa|cious invader, or the &s;ecret purloiner, of proper|ty, who mu&s;t be reputed injurious, but al&s;o the indolent and the di&s;&s;ipated, who deprives his fel|low men of any benefit which he is called to be|&s;tow. They would &s;ee that they are under obli|gations not only to ab&s;tain from po&s;itive violations of ju&s;tice, but al&s;o to di&s;charge many duties of di&s;tingui&s;hed utility to mankind. To the&s;e they would acknowledge them&s;elves particularly call|ed by the appointment of Heaven. Relieved from the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for their corpo|real wants, their minds are furni&s;hed with great|er freedom for the exerci&s;e of its nobler powers, and with a more exten&s;ive range for the di&s;cove|ry and pro&s;ecution of &s;chemes of public good. And as tho&s;e clouds that ob&s;cure their under&s;tand|ing began to remove, an hundred unta&s;ted &s;prings of felicity would open on their hearts. For, if every per&s;on of fortune and rank employed his mo&s;t active endeavors to excite and maintain a &s;pirit of indu&s;try and virtue among his dependents, his neighbors, and fellow-citizens, he would
<PB N="182" REF="025234_0177_0FCCAF2F3B0E06D8">
find his time and attention &s;o happily engaged, that he would &s;urvey with contempt his former plea&s;ures; he would &s;eem to breathe a purer air, and to live in a region of perpetual &s;un&s;hine, while the vapours of low ambition and of &s;en&s;ual indulgence rolled below his feet!</P>
<P>Man can only be happy in as far as his powers are duly exerci&s;ed; and tho&s;e powers, which are the mo&s;t elevated and capacious, afford the great|e&s;t &s;um of felicity. The &s;ame means, therefore, which render any man mo&s;t highly beneficial to others, al&s;o increa&s;e the &s;um of his own enjoy|ments, and &s;uperadd to them that mo&s;t delightful of all &s;atisfactions&mdash;the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;charged, to the utmo&s;t of his power, his duty as a member of the community, and fulfilled the intention of his Creator in &s;ending him into the world. The neglect of the due improvement of any power, or of any opportunity of honorable action, detracts ju&s;t &s;o much from per&s;onal enjoy|ment. As want of circulation corrupts the air, and &s;tagnation the water, &s;o, indolence &s;uperin|duces a torpor on the mind, which unfits it even for the more refined plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, and de|prives it of that great &s;weetener of every enjoy|ment, the reflection that it is the produce of our own exertions, and the natural recompen&s;e of
<PB N="183" REF="025234_0178_0FCCAF302D1B2A38">
merit. With regard to di&s;tinction, acquired by &s;ucce&s;sful exertions of abilities, it is certain, that the &s;ame obligation which demanded the fir&s;t di&s;|play of them, requires their continuance while any benefit can thence re&s;ult to mankind, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are able to confer it. He who has al|ready exerted powers, by which the aggregate of common good has been increa&s;ed, has pledged him&s;elf to a cour&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hed utility, and, if he relaxes or cea&s;es his efforts, while his faculties are &s;till vigorous, is more culpable than if he had never entered on the honorable career; becau&s;e practice procures facility, and &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould ani|mate to fre&s;h enterpri&s;e. If &s;elfi&s;h ambition &s;hould, as is in this ca&s;e mo&s;t probable, be the &s;ole motive to action, let it be con&s;idered, that it is perhaps more difficult to pre&s;erve than to purcha&s;e reputa|tion and homage. The en&s;igns of honor attract the public eye; elevation places men in a more con&s;picuous light, where every defect, as well as every virtue, is more clearly di&s;cerned, and more nicely &s;crutinized. If tho&s;e, therefore, who are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, are not able to &s;upport their &s;ituation with dignity, their di&s;grace will, from the di&s;appointed expectations of mankind, be more humiliating, and the contempt which they incur more general. Envy will magnify every fault, annihilate every virtue, and la&s;h them with the
<PB N="184" REF="025234_0179_0FCCAF31BA25C1E8">
laurels which &s;he has torn from their brows. Hap|py for them&s;elves, and happy for the world, who&s;e intere&s;ts are always hurt by the degradati|on of merit, if they had never ri&s;en above the vulgar level!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE view of &s;ociety, and of the principles on which it is founded, di&s;clo&s;ed in this E&s;&s;ay, evinces the obligation of all its members, of whatever rank or de&s;cription, to contribute their mo&s;t active and hone&s;t endeavors for the common good. In|deed this obligation is &s;ufficiently inculcated on the lower cla&s;&s;es, by the nece&s;&s;ity of laboring for their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and by the dreadful con&s;e|quences which idlene&s;s produces to them and their families. With regard to the&s;e, it is, therefore, le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to unfold the full force of this obli|gation, than with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who&s;e ea&s;y cir|cum&s;tances, &s;eeming to render them independent of their fellow men, &s;eem al&s;o to exempt them from every debt beyond the limits of &s;trict ju&s;tice. This independence we have &s;hewn to be purely imaginary, and utterly incompatible with the prin|ciples of &s;ocial union. The chain of dependence
<PB N="186" REF="025234_0181_0FCCAF356DB33FD0">
runs equally through all the orders of &s;ociety, and binds every individual in the&s;e orders. While it excludes the extravagant claims of &s;elf-love, and &s;ubjects men to more generous and &s;alutary principles, it e&s;tabli&s;hes at the &s;ame time a &s;y&s;tem which, if univer&s;ally ob&s;erved, would fully &s;ecure the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of each individual, by &s;ettling them on the broad and immoveable ba&s;is of general welfare. For, did the rich employ their wealth to &s;upply the wants of the poor; the poor, their labor to admini&s;ter to the ea&s;e and convenience of the rich; the great, their power and authority to protect the weak and defencele&s;s; the wi&s;e, the ingenious, and the learned, their abilities to in&s;truct and coun&s;el the ignorant and illiterate; did every one, in &s;hort, impart to his fellow men a portion of the fruits of his talents and advantages; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould repine at another's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what was employed for his own benefit, nay, was made more &s;ub&s;er|vient to his u&s;e, than if he him&s;elf were the pro|prietor. For no individual could &s;o perfectly cul|tivate all the different talents, nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;upport and welfare, which are di&s;tributed among the &s;pecies, and, while &s;ome particular one is al|lotted to each, are all carried to the highe&s;t im|provement of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="025234_0182_0FCCAF3703F8F3D8">Thus, the principles of equality which we have e&s;tabli&s;hed, at the &s;ame time that they repre&s;s the in&s;olence of pride, the outrages of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the di&s;&s;ipation of &s;en&s;uality, confirm, neverthele&s;s, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubordination, and the ju&s;t de|mands of lawful authority. They maintain in|violate every natural and every civil di&s;tinction, draw more clo&s;ely every &s;ocial tie, and unite all in one harmonious and ju&s;tly proportioned &s;y&s;tem, which brings men together on the even ground of the inherent rights of human nature, of reci|procal obligation, and of a common relation to the community. Yet, for the maintenance of this equality it&s;elf, they &s;eparate them into dif|ferent cla&s;&s;es, and inve&s;t them with different ca|pacities and offices. Thus are the poor and the mean reconciled to their circum&s;tances, or com|forted under them&mdash;the opulent and the power|ful are excited to beneficence and conde&s;cen&s;ion; the ingenious and acute are directed to the be&s;t u&s;e of their abilities; and all are linked together by the powerful ties of common intere&s;ts, and of reciprocal duty. Happy tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ouls are capable of ri&s;ing to &s;uch enlarged views of things, and are animated by them to a conduct worthy of human nature, worthy of Chri&s;tianity, which re|pre&s;ents men to each other as children of one pa|rent, as members of one family, as journeying to|gether
<PB N="188" REF="025234_0183_0FCCAF39752FFF50">
through the checkered &s;cenes of this tran|&s;itory world, towards a region where; all the di&s;tinctions of poverty and riches, of ob&s;curity and &s;plendor, of power and meanne&s;s, &s;hall cea&s;e, every inequality di&s;appear; where virtue alone &s;hall be exalted, and vice degraded forever!</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, indeed, be acknowledged, that this theory is too pure and exalted to admit of a com|plete conformity of practice. But man is quali|fied for endle&s;s improvements in knowledge and virtue, and the happine&s;s which he attains will exactly corre&s;pond to the degrees of his progre&s;s. In every art and &s;cience there is an ideal model, which can never be reached even by the mo&s;t ex|act and beautiful execution. What Cicero ob|&s;erves with regard to a perfect orator, that he had never &s;een any &s;peaker that could come up to his notions of eloquence, is not limited to that art, but is equally applicable to every other. It is, however, to be ob&s;erved, that even the excellence which is attained, is wholly referable to the per|fect &s;tandard previou&s;ly exi&s;ting in the arti&s;ts mind. In proportion, therefore, as clear and elevated ideas of excellence are entertained in re|ligion, in morality, and in politics, and action is directed by the&s;e, human conduct and happine&s;s will be improved and exalted. If, on the other
<PB N="189" REF="025234_0184_0FCCAF3AB4BAD720">
hand, low and groveling &s;tandards are adopted, and principles are regulated by e&s;tabli&s;hed prac|tice, not practice reformed by the genuine princi|ples of nature, mankind will continue to tread in the old and muddy path, and the progre&s;s of the world will be marked with degeneracy and degradation.</P>
<P>It is the con&s;tant objection of tho&s;e, who are either aver&s;e from improvement, or too indolent and too timid to begin or advance it, that the per|fection aimed at is too high for human nature. They thus employ the exi&s;tence of abu&s;es and er|rors as a rea&s;on for perpetuating them. But, if the &s;ame rea&s;oning had always been con&s;idered as ju&s;t, mankind would, at this day, dwell in caves, feed upon acorns, fall down before the works of their own hands, and be bound in the heavy chain of Heathen ignorance and &s;uper&s;ti|tion. The in&s;titutions and refinements of civil &s;ociety mu&s;t appear to a &s;avage as extravagant and impracticable, as the fine&s;t theory of moral &s;entiment and action appears to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ouls are immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;uality, or fettered by &s;elf-intere&s;t. The que&s;tion is not, what is the pre|&s;ent practice of mankind, but what they are qua|lified ultimately to attain; not how far any theo|ry is conformable to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things,
<PB N="190" REF="025234_0185_0FCCAF3D42DF84F8">
but how far it is founded in nature, adapted to the human faculties, and conducive to human felicity.</P>
<P>If the principles illu&s;trated in this E&s;&s;ay &s;hould be devoid of every other recommendation, they have at lea&s;t, that which is no incon&s;iderable one, of being conformable to the doctrines of Chri&s;tia|nity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, xii. 3.4.5.6.7. 1&s;t Cor. xii.</NOTE>. For, although &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who have pretended great zeal for the rights and the happine&s;s of mankind, have manife&s;ted, at the &s;ame time, a &s;trange antipathy to every kind of religion, and particularly to the Chri&s;tian, it will be found, by every impartial inquirer, that the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t inculcates and &s;anctions every principle on which public and private hap|pine&s;s can be built. It is true that Chri&s;tianity has frequently been mo&s;t &s;hamefully corrupted, and, in that corrupted form, produced the mo&s;t dreadful calamities. But, to explode Chri&s;tianity on this account, is ju&s;t as &s;en&s;ible as to forbid man|kind the u&s;e of water, air, or fire, becau&s;e the&s;e elements have often been the vehicles of de&s;truc|tion. Whoever attempts to erect any &s;y&s;tem of policy to the exclu&s;ion of religion, betrays great ignorance of human nature, and great indiffe|rence for human happine&s;s. Man is a religious creature, and is drawn to his Creator by all the

The grand requi&s;ite, then, is to procure for him a religion pure, &s;imple, beneficent, and con&s;olo|tary. This will be found only in the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as it is exhibited in the &s;acred wri|tings. Here the mo&s;t perfect &s;tandard of duty is erected, in order to engage man to an endle&s;s progre&s;s in virtue; a &s;ufficient remedy is provided for his deviations from it, when accompanied with penitence; the mo&s;t glorious rewards are offered to his per&s;evering endeavors; and the &s;tronge&s;t &s;uccours are provided for his weakne&s;s. Such a religion powerfully &s;trengthens every &s;o|cial and civil obligation, and prepares men for heaven, by rendering them u&s;eful on earth.</P>
