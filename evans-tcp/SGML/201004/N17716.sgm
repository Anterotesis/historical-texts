<HEAD>THE FIRST PART. <HI>On the</HI> NATURE <HI>of</HI> CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent inquiry, may be re|duced to the&s;e two points, viz. What is Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m? And, Who are the proper &s;ubjects of it? The&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to re&s;olve by the light of divine revelation.&mdash;And, as I claim no dominion over the faith of any, &s;o I would &s;peak as unto wi&s;e men: judge ye what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered, is, "What is Chri|&s;tian Bapti&s;m?"</P>
<P>In our text, Chri&s;t commi&s;&s;ions his mini&s;ters to bap|tize the nations. We borrow the word Bapti&s;m from
<PB N="2" REF="022944_0003_0FBAC5A504CB2088">
the Greeks; among whom it was commonly u&s;ed to &s;ig|nify a wetting or wa&s;hing in &s;ome mode, as I &s;hall &s;hew more particularly in the &s;equel. Among chri&s;tians, bap|ti&s;m is that Religious and Sacramental wa&s;hing with Water, which Chri&s;t has appointed as the token and &s;ign of our admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, and of our hav|ing an intere&s;t in the privileges, and coming under the obligations of the go&s;pel covenant.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome, who are not content to enjoy all the liberty in our churches that they can rea&s;onably de|&s;ire for them&s;elves. With them there is no true bapti&s;m without dipping: nor will they have chri&s;tian communi|on with any but tho&s;e who have gone into the water. According to them, there are no go&s;pel churches in the world, except of tho&s;e who have been dipped. None are regularly called or &s;ent of God to preach the word, and admini&s;ter go&s;pel ordinances, till they have been dipped. None may pre&s;ume to come, or be admitted to the table of the Lord, till they have been dipped. And thus, as much as in them lies, they unchurch all the churches in the world, except tho&s;e who agree with them in the mode of baptizing.&mdash;They deny the call and mi&s;&s;ion of their mini&s;ters; invalidate and nullify their ordinances, and excommunicate thou&s;ands, whom they cannot deny to be eminent for faith and holine&s;s; and, in a word, make the door of the vi&s;ible church &s;o much narrower than Chri&s;t has made the gate of Heaven, that they reject far the greater part of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t receives.</P>
<P>Now, however willing we are to have Chri&s;tian com|munion with all who, in a judgment of charity, are di&s;|ciples of Chri&s;t; yet if we cannot have it, unle&s;s we will di&s;card the greater part of our chri&s;tian brethren; deny the mi&s;&s;ions and call of tho&s;e, who&s;e mini&s;try has been the means of our own conver&s;ion and edification, de|ny the validity of tho&s;e ordinances, which have &s;o often been brea&s;ts of nouri&s;hment and con&s;olation to us, and renounce our bapti&s;m, which we are con&s;cientiou&s;ly per|&s;uaded is both valid and regular; this we cannot con&s;ent to.&mdash;And if any make this a ground of &s;eparation from
<PB N="3" REF="022944_0004_0FBAC5A6328E94C8">
us, let all who have imbibed the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity judge, whether it be our fault; and whether &s;uch ri|gidne&s;s in a matter &s;o circum&s;tantial, is agreeable to the meek and charitable &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel, or whether it does not rather look too much like Phari&s;aical &s;uper&s;ti|tion, to &s;ay no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Methinks they have more rea&s;on to que&s;tion the va|lidity of their own admini&s;tration, than to deny ours, upon the account of &s;uch irregularities as they charge upon us. For they cannot deny that the bapti&s;m which is admini&s;tered in their communions was received at fir&s;t by their predece&s;&s;ors, from the hands of &s;uch as, accord|ing to their principles, were unbaptized, and con&s;equent|ly could not be regularly authorized to admini&s;ter the ordinance. If they think &s;prinkling to be no true bap|ti&s;m, much more have they rea&s;on to doubt the validity of immer&s;ion, when performed by an unbaptized and un|authorized admini&s;trator. And, if the fir&s;t bapti&s;ms of that &s;ect, when they fir&s;t &s;prung up, were invalid, how can tho&s;e admini&s;trations be thought valid and regular, which depend upon them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore conclude, that dipping cannot be e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m and chri&s;tian communion. The con|&s;equences are not to be endured.&mdash;The difficulties this principle will lead to, are inextricable.&mdash;We never can be &s;atisfied that there is any true church, or valid bap|ti&s;m and ordinances in the world, upon the&s;e narrow principles.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations are certainly of &s;o much weight, that the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping ought not to be in&s;i&s;ted on, unle&s;s there be clear and cogent rea&s;ons for it. The &s;ub|&s;tance of what is pleaded in favour of this mode, is re|ducible to the&s;e four heads:</P>
<P>"That the proper meaning of the word Baptize, al|ways implies dipping.</P>
<P>"That the &s;criptural examples of bapti&s;m were ad|mini&s;tered in this way.</P>
<P>"That this mode of admini&s;tration is plainly pointed out, when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>We are buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="022944_0005_0FBAC5A7B169F2B8">"That dipping only an&s;wers to, and fitly repre&s;ents the thing &s;ignified in bapti&s;m."</P>
<P>On the contrary, we think, that the nece&s;&s;ity of dip|ping cannot be argued from any of the&s;e topics; but that they will furni&s;h us with a good warrant in favour of the mode of affu&s;ion or &s;prinkling. Let us examine the matter di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>And our fir&s;t inquiry is, what is the true and proper meaning of the word Baptize, and whether it always implies dipping? We grant that the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t requires whatever is e&s;&s;ential to a true Bapti&s;m; but more than this cannot be held nece&s;&s;ary. Now, we have no &s;ort of evidence, that the word Baptize always im|plies dipping; but it plainly appears to be of a larger and more general &s;ignification. It properly imports a wetting, wa&s;hing, bathing, in any mode, either by dip|ping or &s;prinkling, or bleeding, or weeping, or other|wi&s;e. In proof of this we appeal,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to tho&s;e who are acknowledged to have been be&s;t &s;killed in the Greek language. All the Lexicons and critics, &s;o far as I have found, agree, that the word &s;ignifies to wet, or wa&s;h, as well as to dip.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it may be &s;aid, <Q>That critics are not infallible, and it may be &s;u&s;pected that they are wrong, in &s;aying, That wa&s;hing or wetting in general, in whatever mode, is expre&s;&s;ed and meant by the word Bapti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer; in que&s;tions concerning the true meaning of words, the judgment of the learned, though not infallible, is doubtle&s;s of very con&s;iderable weight; and e&s;pecially when we find a general con&s;ent among them. And that there certainly is upon this point, that wa&s;hing or wetting, without re&s;pect to the mode, is Bapti&s;m, according to the u&s;age of the word by Greek writers. But if any are yet un&s;atisfied, we mu&s;t examine the mat|ter further; whether it can certainly be made to appear that the word bears the &s;en&s;e which has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>They who have been at the pains to examine the Greek cla&s;&s;ics (Dr. Wall in particular) have proved by clear and manifold examples, that tho&s;e ancient writers
<PB N="5" REF="022944_0006_0FBAC5AA19852C30">
were wont to u&s;e the word Baptize to expre&s;s a wa&s;hing or wetting, even where there was no dipping at all, but only a &s;prinkling. But I think it will be needle&s;s to inquire, how the word was commonly under&s;tood by heathen writers: it is the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e alone that we are &s;earching after. If this can be a&s;certained, we need no more.</P>
<P>The word baptize is u&s;ed in &s;cripture to expre&s;s &s;uch wa&s;hings as did not require, and were not effected by dipping. In Luke xi. 38, we read, that a Phari&s;ee who had invited Je&s;us to dine with him, "marvelled that he had not fir&s;t Wa&s;hed." The Greek word is Baptized. Here ob&s;erve, that Je&s;us omitted to wa&s;h before dinner according to the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom, which was the rea&s;on why the Phari&s;ee wondered; and that this Wa&s;hing was properly called a Bapti&s;m. But how were the Jews wont ordinarily to wa&s;h before their meals? Did they dip them&s;elves under water? If not, here is a plain proof and example of a wa&s;hing that is called a bapti&s;m, with|out &s;uch a dipping. Now, if we turn to Mark vii. we &s;hall &s;ee what that wa&s;hing was that was cu&s;tomary among the Jews before eating. <Q>When the Phari&s;ees and &s;ome of the Scribes &s;aw &s;ome of his di&s;ciples eat bread with defiled (that is to &s;ay, with unwa&s;hen) hands, they found fault. For the Phari&s;ees, and all the Jews, except they wa&s;h their hands oft, eat not. And when they come from the market, except they wa&s;h (the Greek is, except they are baptized) they eat not.</Q> This &s;hews, that in the language of the New Te&s;tament a per&s;on is &s;aid to be baptized, when a &s;mall part of his body is wa&s;hed.</P>
<P>Again, in Heb. ix. 10, the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the Jew|i&s;h ritual as &s;tanding in divers Wa&s;hings; the Greek is, different Bapti&s;ms. And it appears that purifications by &s;prinkling are e&s;pecially intended. For he adds, with a plain reference to, and as an illu&s;tration of, what he had ju&s;t &s;aid: <Q>If the blood of bulls and goats, and the a&s;hes of an heifer, &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t,</Q> &amp;c. which &s;hews that the&s;e purifi|cations
<PB N="6" REF="022944_0007_0FBAC5ABE010EC60">
by &s;prinkling are in&s;tances of tho&s;e wa&s;hings or bapti&s;ms he had mentioned, and indeed &s;ome of the chief in&s;tances: otherwi&s;e it would not have been pertinent to his purpo&s;e to have noticed them on this occa&s;ion. A plain proof that &s;prinkling is a true bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Further, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays of the I&s;raelites who came out of Egypt, that <Q>they were baptized unto Mo&s;es in the cloud, and in the &s;ea,</Q> 1 Cor. x. 2. How were they baptized? Certainly they were not dipped. For they went on dry ground through the &s;ea, which &s;tood as a wall on each hand. It was the Egyptians on|ly that were baptized by immer&s;ion. According to the account Mo&s;es gives, the I&s;raelites could no otherwi&s;e be baptized in the cloud and &s;ea, than by being &s;prinkled with rain from the one, and a &s;pray from the other, as they pa&s;&s;ed along: to which P&s;al. lxviii. 7, 8, 9, is thought to refer. Here is then another in&s;tance of bapti&s;m by &s;prinkling; which was a token of the &s;eparation or &s;anc|tification of the people to God. This gives a natural and ea&s;y account of the matter. But how unnatural and &s;trained is our opponents' way of explaining it: <Q>That the people having the &s;ea on each hand, and the cloud over their heads, &s;eemed to be as it were dipped or enclo&s;ed in water.</Q> On which I would ob&s;erve, that the Apo&s;tle &s;ays not that they &s;eemed to be as it were baptized, but in plain terms that they were Bap|tized. But whatever re&s;emblances of dipping, people may imagine, immer&s;ion without wetting is certainly no real bapti&s;m. For whether the mode of wa&s;hing be e&s;|&s;ential or not, yet the wa&s;hing or wetting it&s;elf is indeed e&s;&s;ential to a true and proper bapti&s;m. If people may be baptized by having the water round them, though they were not wet by it at all, the dry hold of a &s;hip upon the water would &s;erve as well as Jordan: and, by going down into it, we &s;hall be dipped in the &s;ea in like man|ner as the I&s;raelites were.&mdash;The fathers were baptized in the cloud and &s;ea.&mdash;A true bapti&s;m nece&s;&s;arily implies wetting. They were not wet by immer&s;ion&mdash;they could not therefore be baptized by immer&s;ion&mdash;whatever wa&s;h|ing they received could be only by &s;prinkling.&mdash;It was
<PB N="7" REF="022944_0008_0FBAC5ACEFD57FA8">
therefore in this made undoubtedly that they were bap|tized. Which is another proof that &s;prinkling is a mode of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the words of Chri&s;t, Luke xii. 50, <Q>I have a bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> to be baptized with, and how am I &s;traitened till it be accompli&s;hed.</Q> Chri&s;t here calls his &s;ufferings a bapti&s;m. The &s;acred body of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was truly and literally baptized.&mdash;He was wet and bathed in his own tears, and &s;weat, and blood, in his agony in the garden, and when he was &s;courged, and nailed to the cro&s;s. He was baptized and &s;anctifi|ed by the blood of the covenant, Heb. x. 29, that is, by his own blood; even as the Jewi&s;h high prie&s;ts were bap|tized, &s;anctified, and con&s;ecrated with water and the blood of bea&s;ts, as types of Chri&s;t. And accordingly it was a common expre&s;&s;ion of the ancient fathers, con|cerning the martyrs, who had &s;hed their blood in bear|ing witne&s;s to the Chri&s;tian faith, that they were bap|tized with their own blood.&mdash;Here is then, I think, an|other very good proof, that dipping is no ways e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m.&mdash;For, Chri&s;t was not dipped, and his mar|tyrs are not dipped in their bloody bapti&s;m, but he was wet, and tinged, and bathed in his &s;weat, and blood i&s;&s;uing from his pores and veins.</P>
<P>Let us now make &s;ome remarks on the bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t, which is often &s;poken of. This is indeed a &s;piritual bapti&s;m, by which the &s;ubjects of it were &s;anc|tified, con&s;ecrated, and &s;eparated to God, in a higher and more eminent &s;en&s;e, than tho&s;e were who had only been con&s;ecrated by water bapti&s;m. But how is this &s;piritual bapti&s;m explained? There are &s;everal expre&s;&s;i|ons which are plainly of the &s;ame import; &s;uch as the "pouring out of the &s;pirit" upon the &s;ubject. When the Apo&s;tles were baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, ac|cording to Chri&s;t's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;e, Acts i. 5, Peter ob&s;erves, that this was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel, <Q>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days, &s;aith God, I will pour out of my &s;pirit,</Q> Acts ii. 17, and again, ver&s;e 33, <Q>That Chri&s;t being by the right hand of God ex|alted, and having received of the Father the promi&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="022944_0009_0FBAC5AEB4B09620">
of the Holy Gho&s;t, he hath &s;hed or poured forth tho&s;e things which ye now &s;ee and hear.</Q> Here we &s;ee "that pouring upon," and baptizing, are &s;ynoni|mous expre&s;&s;ions. The one explaine the other. Now, if the pouring out of the Spirit be the bapti&s;m of the Spi|rit, the pouring of water mu&s;t al&s;o be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> bapti&s;m of wa|ter.&mdash;It is to be well ob&s;erved, that as the Holy Spirit is in &s;cripture often &s;ignified by water, as a fit emblem of his &s;anctifying and comforting influences; &s;o the confer|ring of the &s;pirit upon us, which is undoubtedly the true intendment of the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, is not re|pre&s;ented by the &s;imilitude of dipping into water, but as a pouring or &s;prinkling of water upon us.&mdash;I&s;a. xliv. 3, <Q>I will pour waters on the thir&s;ty, and floods on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit on thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing on thine offspring.</Q> See al&s;o Ezek. xxxvi. 27, <Q>I will &s;prinkle clean water on you, and ye &s;hall be clean. A new heart will I give you,</Q> &amp;c. All which I think proves plainly, that &s;prinkling is in &s;cripture con&s;idered as a mode of bapti&s;m.&mdash;I will add one remark more. The bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is termed, an unction or anointing, 1 John ii. 20, 27. The holy oil, with which per&s;ons were anointed in their con&s;ecration, was a &s;ign or emblem of the Holy Spirit given to them, to fit them for the offices to which they were called. The &s;ame is al&s;o &s;ignified by Chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m. Now, it is by pouring on of oil that per&s;ons are anointed; and it is by pouring out of the Spirit upon us, that our anointing or bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is expre&s;&s;ed. As therefore bapti&s;m an&s;wers in &s;ignification to anointing, we may well conclude, that it may pro|perly be admini&s;tered in the &s;ame way, that is, by affu|&s;ion. Can we doubt whether affu&s;ion be a true bapti&s;m, when we find that in &s;cripture, Baptizing, Pouring, Sprinkling, and Anointing, are parallel, and &s;ignify the &s;ame thing?</P>
<P>One remark more I will add. In all the different tran&s;lations of the New Te&s;tament that I have &s;een, I have not found that the word <HI>baptize</HI> in the original is ever rendered by a word &s;ignifying or implying immer|&s;ion.
<PB N="9" REF="022944_0010_0FBAC5B21446F2D0">
But they either retain the original word, or ren|der i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wa&s;hing or ablution; which we cannot think they would have done, if the authors had not been &s;atisfied that this is the true &s;criptural &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>To find and a&s;certain the &s;ignification of the word, will, I think, determine the di&s;pute concerning the mode of Bapti&s;m. For which rea&s;on, I have examined the matter more carefully. And the conclu&s;ion in which this inquiry has i&s;&s;ued, will not be at all weakened, but rather much confirmed by the account we have in the &s;criptures of the admini&s;tration of this ordinance. And this leads us to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping can be ar|gued from the&s;e &s;criptural precedents. Some &s;uppo&s;e, that <Q>John Bapti&s;t and the Apo&s;tles baptized by im|mer&s;ion only: And that we are bound herein &s;trictly to follow their example.</Q> On the contrary, we can find no certainty that immer&s;ion was ever practi&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic age. It is morally certain that this was not the con&s;tant mode of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It is true, we read that Je&s;us was baptized by John in Jordan; and then came up out of the water, Mark i. 9, 10. <Q>That the Jews were al&s;o baptized of John in Jordan," Mat. iii. 6. "That John baptized in Enon, becau&s;e there was much water," John iii. 23. That the Eunuch went down into the water with Phi|lip, and when he was baptized they came up out of the water,</Q> Acts viii. 38, 39. But whether any of the&s;e were dipped is uncertain. It is not even certain whether in any of the&s;e in&s;tances they went into and were baptized, in the water; though the texts are &s;o rendered in our Engli&s;h Bible. But the Greek, which is the authentic &s;tandard, will fairly admit of this &s;en&s;e, as critics have often ob&s;erved, viz. That they went down to, were baptized at, and went up from the water.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Greek text does not determine whether Je&s;us and the Jews were baptized in Jordan or only at Jordan, for the particles (en and eis) h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e u&s;ed, &s;ignify, in, at, or to. See Rom. viii. 34 (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n), At the right hand of God. Nor is it certain that the Eu|nuch went into the water. The particle (eis) is often rendered to, John xx. 4. The other di&s;ciple came fir&s;t (eis) to the &s;epulchre, yet went he not in. Philip and the Eunuch went up (ok) from the water: &s;o the particle is el&s;ewhere rendered. See Matth. xii. 42, The queen of the &s;outh came (ok) from the uttermo&s;t ends of the earth. Je&s;us when he was baptized went up (apo) from the water; as the phra&s;e mo&s;t properly &s;ignifies. I do not mention the&s;e things as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lting our Engli&s;h tran&s;lation. All that I aim at is, that the original may fairly be rendered either way; and that this circum&s;tances, as it is imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rial, &s;o it is le&s;t undetermined.</NOTE>
<PB N="10" REF="022944_0011_0FBAC5B4A692FC18">
But, waving this remark, &s;uppo&s;ing they did go into the water, and were there baptized; it does not follow that they were plunged. It is nothing &s;trange or improba|ble if they &s;tepped into the water, that they might be baptized by affu&s;ion. Though there was much water, or many waters (as the phra&s;e properly &s;ignifies) at Enon, where John was baptizing. This is no proof that he dipped, or made u&s;e of much water in bapti&s;m, or that there was even a convenient depth of water for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. Travellers have reported that there are only &s;prings and &s;mall rivulets to be found in this place. As multitudes re&s;orted to John, a place that was well &s;up|plied with water, for their u&s;e and refre&s;hment, would be mo&s;t convenient, &s;uppo&s;e none of them were dipped, as I find no certainty that they were. And if any &s;hould think that the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m at rivers, and in places where there was plenty of water, is a circum|&s;tance that favours immer&s;ion, though it is needle&s;s to conte&s;t this point, yet we might ea&s;ily mention &s;everal things as probable arguments that immer&s;ion was not practi&s;ed in the&s;e in&s;tances. It &s;eems unlikely that mix|ed multitudes of both &s;exes &s;hould be dipped naked. And it was contrary to the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom to bathe with any of their clothes on; in which re&s;pect they were &s;o &s;trict, that they held a per&s;on to be unclean, if but the top of one of his fingers were covered, when he bathed him|&s;elf for his clean&s;ing.&mdash;Or if immer&s;ion were received with the clothes on, this would require a &s;hifting of ap|parel, which we have no hint of. Nor can we ea&s;ily conceive how &s;trangers, who came from home without any de&s;ign of being baptized, as was the ca&s;e with &s;ome,

&s;hould be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary change of raiment for this purpo&s;e. Or how John &s;hould be able, without a miracle, to bear the hard&s;hip of &s;tanding in the water up to his wai&s;t, a great part of his time, to dip the mul|titudes that came to him. The&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t &s;urely weaken, if not overbalance, all probabilities or pre|&s;umptions that can be pleaded in favour of immer&s;ion, in the&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>But be this as it may, we have accounts of &s;everal in|&s;tances, &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being dipped is mo&s;t incredible. Particularly the 3000 baptized on the day of Penteco&s;t. For it was at lea&s;t nine o'clock when Peter began his &s;ermon. After this he had a long conference, and with many words coun|&s;elled, te&s;tified, and exhorted them. Then the Apo|&s;tles had to receive a confe&s;&s;ion of faith from each of them di&s;tinctly: and then baptize them &s;everally: which, though done in the quicke&s;t manner, would require the whole remainder of the day. But in the &s;lower way of immer&s;ion, we cannot conceive how it could be done by the Apo&s;tles without a miracle. Nor may we &s;uppo&s;e that the Apo&s;tles were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this work by the &s;e|venty di&s;ciples, who appear not to have been authorized to admini&s;ter the ordinances. Be&s;ides, how incredible is it, that they &s;hould on a &s;udden find conveniences for dipping &s;o many, in the mid&s;t of a city, among zealous oppo&s;ers: or that &s;o many &s;trangers &s;hould either be baptized naked, or have change of raiment. We can|not rationally think, that they could be baptized other|wi&s;e than by affu&s;ion. Nor is it probable that Paul was baptized by immer&s;ion: for, upon Ananias coming in to him, putting his hands upon him, &amp;c. we read, that he immediately received his &s;ight, aro&s;e and was baptized; that is, in the hou&s;e where he was: there being no hint of his going out to any water, weak as he was with long fa&s;ting and agitation of mind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 17, 18. Note, Paul was baptized without a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, upon Chri&s;t's te&s;timony concerning him, that he was a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el. The te&s;timony of Chri&s;t, that infants are of the kingdom of heaven, are holy, are intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, is as good a warrant for baptizing them without a profe&s;&s;ion of their faith.</NOTE> It is not probable that

tho&s;e were dipped who were baptized at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, Acts x. 47. Peter &s;eeing them filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;aid, <Q>Can any man forbid water, that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized.</Q> The natural &s;en&s;e is, Can any forbid water, to be brought or provided to baptize the&s;e: not, whether any could forbid their go|ing to the water. And, in the account of their bapti&s;m, there is no hint of their going from the hou&s;e. It is highly improbable, that the jailer and his hou&s;e were baptized by immer&s;ion; for, this was done in the night, and in the pri&s;on, where there was no river nor pool to be imagined. Can it be thought, that the jailer, with his whole family, and his pri&s;oners, whom he was charg|ed to keep at his peril, &s;hould at &s;uch an hour, grope away in the dark, or go with a lanthorn or torch to a river or pool, no one knows where, and that through a city, ju&s;t waked up with a great earthquake, and the &s;treets, it is probable, filled with the frighted citizens? They might all well expect to be taken up and puni&s;h|ed for helping the pri&s;oners to make their e&s;cape. Nor is it credible that the Apo&s;tles would have done &s;uch a thing, who would not leave the pri&s;on till the magi&s;trates took them out. The admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m would, doubtle&s;s, have been deferred, if it could not then have been attended to without all this difficulty and danger. Be&s;ides, there is no account of their going out to the water or leaving the pri&s;on. The hou&s;e of the jailer, into which he brought the Apo&s;tles, &s;eems to have been a &s;eparate apartment of the building, where the keeper dwelt, that he might conveniently attend his charge. And we may here make this general remark; that among all the in&s;tances of bapti&s;m mentioned in the New Te&s;tament, it is never &s;aid or intimated, that they went from the place where they happened to be, to any river or &s;tream, that they might be baptized in or at it.

By bapti&s;m, we are not only dedicated to Chri&s;t, and brought into a &s;pecial relation to him as his di&s;ciples; but, our bapti&s;m is the outward &s;ign of our ingrafting into Chri&s;t, and &s;o of our &s;piritual union to him, and communion with him, in the benefits obtained for the members of his body, by his crucifixion, death, burial, and re&s;urrection; and al&s;o of our obligation to a &s;piritu|al conformity to his crucifixion, death, burial, and re|&s;urrection, as is noted and illu&s;trated in what follows.

The old man, with his deeds, mu&s;t be put off, utterly rejected and buried. We mu&s;t, in re&s;pect of our former lu&s;ts and conver&s;ation, be as if we were "dead and buried."

<P>I might further ob&s;erve, that dipping a per&s;on in wa+ter does not re&s;emble the burial of Chri&s;t, who was not laid in a common grave, but in a tomb hewn out of the &s;ide of a rock, into which they entered by a door. Nor does it re&s;emble a common burial, which is not &s;o properly the letting down the body into the grave, as the ca&s;ting in the earth upon it; of which the &s;prinkling or pouring of water on a per&s;on is no unfit repre&s;enta|tion; but dipping bears no re&s;emblance to it. It is not an outward, but a &s;piritual conformity to Chri&s;t's death and burial that is intended by our being buried with him in bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Let us now inquire, Fourthly, Whether dipping an|&s;wers to, and repre&s;ents the thing &s;ignified in Bapti&s;m better than &s;prinkling. It has ju&s;t been ob&s;erved, that Bapti&s;m is the outward &s;ign and taken of the applica|tion of the benefits of redemption to believers, in their ju&s;tification and &s;anctification. <Q>Chri&s;t wa&s;hes us from our &s;ins in his own blood.</Q> And Bapti&s;m, as the outward &s;ign of the application of Chri&s;t's blood, is, "for the wa&s;hing away of &s;ins." But how is the ap|plication of Chri&s;t's blood for our clean&s;ing repre&s;ented? It is called, "the blood of &s;prinkling." And the Apo|&s;tle &s;peaks of the <Q>&s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> But we are never &s;aid to be clean&s;ed from &s;in by being dipped into the blood of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Again, Bapti&s;m is the in&s;tituted &s;ign of our having the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t be&s;towed upon us. "Be baptized," &s;ays Peter, <Q>and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> Now, the donation of the Holy Gho&s;t is never expre&s;&s;ed by our being dipped into the Holy Gho&s;t; but by his being poured out, and our being

<HEAD>THE SECOND PART. <HI>On the</HI> SUBJECTS <HI>of</HI> BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd part of the argument in hand, was to con&s;ider who are the proper &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m, or to whom this ordinance is to be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent inquiry, concerning the &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m, is, Who they are that, according to the go&s;pel rule, are to be admitted by the church? In an&s;wer to which, we &s;ay, that all who make a credible profe&s;&s;ion of faith, are proper &s;ubjects, together with infants, or children in minority. It is agreed, that profe&s;&s;ed believers are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. And that this ordi|nance is not to be admini&s;tered to one of adult age, un|le&s;s he has in &s;ome manner made a credible profe&s;&s;ion of (at lea&s;t, penitential) faith. But that the infants of members of the vi&s;ible church are to be received as mem|bers al&s;o, and as the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n denied by &s;ome; and the admini&s;tering the ordi|nance to infants, has been cen&s;ured as irregular, un|warrantable, of no validity or advantage.</P>

<P>But before I enter on the proof of the point be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> us, let it be ob&s;erved and remembered&mdash;That there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nothing po&s;itive in the New Te&s;tament again&s;t infant bapti&s;m. It is no where &s;aid or hinted, that the Apo|&s;tles forbid or refu&s;ed, or declined to baptize infants; or that any child of a believer was, after he was grown up, baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ac|knowledged, that infants are capable not only of the outward &s;ign of bapti&s;m, but al&s;o of having an intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ings and Grace of the New Covenant, and coming under its bonds, which is the thing &s;ignified in the ordinance, and that they need tho&s;e New Covenant ble&s;&s;ings. Further, it is no where declared in &s;cripture, either in expre&s;s, or equivalent terms, that "adult per|&s;ons only," or that "none but tho&s;e who believe," or profe&s;s faith, are to be baptized. In &s;hort, there is ab&s;olutely and perfectly nothing that &s;tands in the way of our embracing the doctrine of infant bapti&s;m, if we can find any kind of evidence in favour of it, either ex|pre&s;s or con&s;equential.&mdash;This then is what we have now to inquire into, viz. Whether any &s;uch evidence ap|pears? And I think enough may be collected from the &s;criptures to put the matter beyond all rea&s;onable doubt.</P>
<P>And my fir&s;t argument is taken from the church mem|ber&s;hip of infants:</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who are to be received as mem|bers of the vi&s;ible church are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.&mdash;But infants are to be received as members of the vi&s;ible church. They are therefore &s;ubjects of Bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>Some have pretended "that it is incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;ay, that a right to bapti&s;m is grounded upon church mem|ber&s;hip, and yet that we are admitted into the church by bapti&s;m."

Which will &s;erve as well for a rea&s;on why lambs and doves &s;hould be brought and pre&s;ented to him, as Mr. Henry well ob&s;erves. Becau&s;e the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts of grown per&s;ons, meek and harmle&s;s like children, is it a ju&s;t and plain con&s;equence, that children &s;hould be brought and pre&s;ented to Chri&s;t; though they belong not to his kingdom?

<P>Again, the reception which Chri&s;t gave tho&s;e children, and his actions towards them, may put it out of all doubt that he acknowledged them as the &s;ubjects of his kingdom. For he took them in his arms, put his hands upon them, and ble&s;&s;ed them. Chri&s;t never pronounced a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing upon any but tho&s;e whom he owned as the &s;ubjects of his kingdom. By laying his hands on the&s;e children and ble&s;&s;ing them, he recognized them as his own people, and put upon them the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me token of acknowledgment which he gave his di&s;ciples immediate|ly before his a&s;cen&s;ion. The ble&s;&s;ing was always look|ed upon as a &s;acred thing, which belonged only to the profe&s;&s;ed wor&s;hippers and people of God; e&s;pecially that &s;olemn religious ble&s;&s;ing in the name of God, with impo&s;ition of hands, which had been practi&s;ed in the church in all ages. None were the &s;ubjects of this, upon any occa&s;ion that we read of, but they that belong|ed to the church. When we read that God ble&s;&s;ed

<P>Infants then mu&s;t be allowed to belong to the king|dom of heaven. Chri&s;t has declared them &s;o by words and actions as &s;ignificant as po&s;&s;ible. But, it may be inquired, What are we to under&s;tand by the kingdom of heaven? I an&s;wer, it is plainly the church that is here meant.&mdash;It will be needle&s;s to confirm this by particular quotations; they are &s;o many, and &s;o well known to all who have read the New Te&s;tament with any attention. Nor is it denied by any that I know of: and, I think, it is the Vi&s;ible Church that is to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t declares, that the&s;e children were then mem|bers of the kingdom of heaven. <Q>Of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven.</Q> But, will any &s;ay, that the kingdom of glory con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who are have upon earth? They were upon earth, and were in the kingdom of heaven upon earth, if they were in it at all; that is, in the kingdom of grace or vi&s;ible church.</P>
<P>But, if it were &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e words are to be under&s;tood as affirming, that children belong to the in|vi&s;ible church, and as &s;uch, are heirs of the kingdom of glory; yet this will prove that they ought to be ac|knowledged and received as members of the vi&s;ible church. For, can they be rea&s;onably refu&s;ed a place in the church on earth, whom Chri&s;t affirms to be heirs of heaven?

And, is not the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t a &s;ufficient creden|tial to warrant our receiving them? Our Lord &s;ubjoins the following memorable words, in which he &s;trikes at the very root of his di&s;ciples' error, which their conduct di&s;covered. <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, &s;hall not enter therein.</Q> The di&s;ciples were much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tand upon their di&s;tinctions. They &s;eemed to think that they had a clearer and better title to the privileges of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom than infants. They were actual believers and followers of Chri&s;t; which could not be &s;aid of babes. If the&s;e are admitted to have a part in this kingdom, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a &s;pecial indulgence and favour to them, who have done nothing to give them any claim to &s;uch a privilege.

<P>Now ob&s;erve, Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of &s;uch children" (or, "this child," as it is in Luke ix. 48) "in my name, receiveth me."

<P>Let us now con&s;ider more particularly the words of our text, containing the Apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion. <Q>Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: teach|ing them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have com|manded you.</Q> It has been ob&s;erved, that the words properly &s;ignify, <Q>Go make or admit all nations Di&s;ci|ples, baptizing them&mdash;teaching them,</Q> &amp;c. This, our oppo&s;ers do not deny. But, they &s;ay, that no one can be made a di&s;ciple but by teaching; which is true, only with re&s;pect to adults: becau&s;e no "&s;uch per&s;ons," are to be admitted into the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, but by their own con&s;ent, and a previous profe&s;&s;ion of their faith in him, and obedience to him; and this nece&s;&s;a|rily pre-requires teaching. But to argue from hence, that infants are not to be admitted as di&s;ciples, becau&s;e not in a pre&s;ent capacity of being taught, and profe&s;&s;ing their faith, is no better than begging the que&s;tion, talk|ing at random, and without proof. Though adults are not made di&s;ciples, till they are fir&s;t taught, and are not admitted but upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, yet with infants the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e. They are to be admitted by the order of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without a per&s;onal <Q>profe&s;|&s;ion and con&s;ent,</Q> of which they are not capable. But this may be further con&s;idered afterwards.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee whether any thing can be argued from the words, in favour of infant di&s;ciple&s;hip and bap|ti&s;m.&mdash;When the Apo&s;tles received an order to di&s;ciple all nations, they would naturally under&s;tand, that they had it in charge to make all nations pro&s;elytes, to intro|duce and admit them into the church of Chri&s;t, as a &s;chool, in which they were to be taught and trained up in the knowledge and ob&s;ervance of chri&s;tianity, in order to their being meet for heaven. It is true neither infants nor adults are expre&s;sly named. But the Apo&s;tles were &s;ent to di&s;ciple and baptize "the nations," which none can deny, include per&s;ons of every age. And the

Not only &s;o, but &s;uch infants were baptized; as the ancient Jews report. They knew that Chri&s;t had taught them that little children belonged to the kingdom of Heaven; that he had accordingly laid his hands, and pronounced a &s;olemn ble&s;&s;ing upon them; and &s;ignified his will that they be received in his name, as belonging to him; and that them&s;elves had been reproved by him for forbidding infants to be brought to receive his ble&s;&s;ing.

They under&s;tood that the privileges of the church were to be enlarged, and not abridged in any re&s;pect.&mdash;Now, the Apo&s;tles, who&s;e views and apprehen&s;ions may have been &s;uch as has been repre&s;ented, would, without doubt, have under&s;tood that they were in&s;tructed by their commi&s;&s;ion, to admit the children with the parents into the number of pro&s;elytes by the initiating rite, as had been the con&s;tant practice of the church.&mdash;They mu&s;t have under&s;tood the matter as a mini&s;ter who had never heard that infant bapti&s;m was ever objected to, would under&s;tand his charge, if he was ordained and &s;ent out to preach to the heathen, and gather churches among them, baptizing them.

Whether the children born in &s;uch a marri|age were to be reckoned as fit to be of the church, with the believing parents; or were to be ranked with the unbelieving parent, and &s;o reckoned among heathens that were without?&mdash;Though infants had always been received as members of the Old Te&s;tament church, yet when the Jews had, in the time of Ezia married &s;trange wives which had born them children, the&s;e children were not received; but it was ordered that they be put away, together with their heathen parents, as unclean. It might therefore be a &s;cruple, whether a believer, and member of the Chri&s;tian church, were obliged or allow|ed to live in the &s;tate of marriage with an unbeliever; and whether their children were not to be excluded from the church, as the unclean offspring of a heathen parent; as had been determined among the Jews in the ca&s;e ju&s;t mentioned. This point, the Apo&s;tle plainly re&s;olves, de|claring, that a believer is not defiled by having conjugal &s;ociety with an unbeliever. On the contrary, &s;ays he, "The unbelieving hu&s;band is &s;anctified by the wife," or rather is &s;anctified in or to the wife, <Q>and the unbe|lieving wife is &s;anctified in or to the hu&s;band.</Q> That is, the believer, has a lawful and &s;anctified enjoyment of an unbelieving yoke-fellow. For, as the Apo&s;tle el&s;e|where teaches us, <Q>All things are pure to him that is pure. And every creature of God is good, and no|thing to be refu&s;ed. For, it is &s;anctified by the word of God and prayer.</Q> Thus the unbelieving hu&s;band
<PB N="28" REF="022944_0029_0FBAC5D837119860">
or wife is &s;anctified to the believer, as every creature of God is, which we may have occa&s;ion to u&s;e. Formerly, all that were out of the pale of the church were account|ed unclean; and a Jew would have been defiled by liv|ing with a heathen wife. But now there is no defile|ment in the lawful u&s;e of any of God's creatures. They are all &s;anctified to a believer. Or we may take the meaning of the&s;e words thus: a believer and unbeliever being married together, are one fle&s;h; they are one prin|ciple or &s;ource of offspring. But though an unbeliever, con&s;idered in him&s;elf per&s;onally, is unholy, and has no claim to church privileges; yet the children are entitled to the&s;e privileges, as fully and perfectly in all re&s;pects, as if both the parents were believers. For the unbe|lieving hu&s;band being one fle&s;h with the believing wife, is &s;anctified in or by her, &s;o far as re&s;pects the church privileges of children. The hu&s;band, though an unbe|liever, is, in con&s;equence of his union in marriage with a believer, in &s;ome &s;ort &s;anctified. The unbeliever, in this relation is capable of tran&s;mitting church privileges to his offspring, to as good advantage as any believer.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle goes on&mdash;<Q>El&s;e were your children un|clean,</Q> as the heathen were termed and accounted. All tho&s;e who were aliens from the commonwealth of I&s;|rael, and &s;trangers to the covenant of the promi&s;e, and not members of the church of God, were commonly reputed uncircumci&s;ed and unclean. They were not admitted into the holy place, or to attend on holy ordinances. Now, if the unbelieving wife were not &s;anctified to and by the believer, as has been &s;aid, the children mu&s;t have been unclean, and &s;o not be received as members of the church, and &s;ubjects of holy ordinances.&mdash;<Q>But now they are holy</Q>&mdash;and are to be admitted into the vi|&s;ible church, into the &s;ociety and fellow&s;hip of tho&s;e who are vi&s;ibly &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, and de|voted to God as his holy people. The word, Holy, as it is u&s;ed in &s;cripture, is applied to per&s;ons and things that are devoted and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cated to God. Men are term|ed holy either as being &s;eparated from the re&s;t of man|kind, and &s;tanding in a peculiar relation to God, as his
<PB N="29" REF="022944_0030_0FBAC5D92F7185E8">
vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ing people; or as being conformed to the will and moral image of God in temper and practice. The one is called a relative, the other an inherent holi|ne&s;s. The fir&s;t is attributed to all tho&s;e who belong to the vi&s;ible church. Thus the people of I&s;rael are all &s;poken of as an holy people. And, upon the &s;ame ac|count, go&s;pel churches are con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;ting of faints, or holy per&s;ons. For, though it is not &s;uppo&s;ed that they are all really and inherently holy, or partakers of a divine nature, yet they are vi&s;ibly the people of God, &s;eparated and devoted to him. But let it be par|ticularly noted, that no per&s;on is ever &s;tiled holy, from the beginning to the end of the bible, except he be of the church of God. And in the New Te&s;tament, a Saint, or Holy Per&s;on, a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, a Member of the Church, and a Subject of the Kingdom of Heaven, are of the &s;ame &s;ignification. Now, &s;ince we find that the title or appellation of Holy is never given to any per&s;on in the world, except he be of the church; and &s;ince the Apo&s;tle declares, that the children of believers are holy; it is a plain and undeniable con&s;equence, that &s;uch chil|dren are of the church, and are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, as was to be proved.</P>
<P>The Antipedobapti&s;ts have endeavoured, in vain, to wring and wre&s;t the&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle to a com|pliance with their tenets.&mdash;But, in the fir&s;t place they would per&s;uade us, <Q>That the Holine&s;s which the Apo|&s;tle here intends, cannot be that which is implied in, and connected with church member&s;hip.&mdash;For, they &s;ay, the &s;ame Holine&s;s which is a&s;cribed to the chil|dren, is al&s;o attributed to the unbelieving parent.&mdash; If the children are Holy, the unbelieving hu&s;band and wife are al&s;o &s;aid to be &s;anctified.</Q> But, I an&s;wer, the Apo&s;tle's words plainly &s;hew, that the unbelieving yoke-fellow is only &s;anctified to the believer, as all the creatures of God are &s;aid to be &s;anctified to the Saints, &s;o as that they may have a holy u&s;e and enjoyment of them. He is not &s;anctified in re&s;pect to God, but only in re&s;pect to his wife and offspring, who derive no more defilement either by conjugal cohabitation with or by
<PB N="30" REF="022944_0031_0FBAC5DAB0FD7160">
natural generation from him, than if he were a be|liever.&mdash;In a word, the unbelieving hu&s;band is only &s;anc|tified in that particular re&s;pect, and unto the particu|lar purpo&s;e there pointed at, as has been &s;aid.&mdash;But the Children are declared to be not unclean, but "holy." A title which is never given to any but tho&s;e that are of the church. Unbelievers who belong not to the church may be &s;anctified, or prepared as in&s;truments to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of divine goodne&s;s to the &s;aints. But this re&s;pective &s;anctification does never give them the deno|mination of "Holy ones." The words of the text, and the rea&s;on of the thing therefore plainly &s;hew, that the &s;anctification of the unbelieving hu&s;band or wife is a different thing from the holine&s;s of the children.&mdash; This gives a good, pertinent, and in&s;tructive &s;en&s;e to the Apo&s;tle's words, which are taken and explained in the &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, as no doubt they ought to be.</P>
<P>And hence we &s;ee, there is no ju&s;t foundation for that objection, <Q>That the unbelieving parent being &s;ancti|fied by a believing yoke-fellow, may as well be con|cluded to be a member of the church and &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, as the children who&s;e holine&s;s depends upon this &s;anctification of the parents.</Q> For a per&s;on's being &s;anctified in &s;ome certain re&s;pect, does not give him the denomination of a holy one, in the language of the &s;criptures; which is a peculiar and appropriate title of tho&s;e who belong to the church, and is never given to any others of the children of men. And, &s;ince the children are Holy, which is not &s;aid of the unbelieving parent, though in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;anctified, the children are to be acknowledged as of the church, but not the unbelieving parent.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider how this pa&s;&s;age is expounded by tho&s;e on the other &s;ide. And here they would per|&s;uade us, <Q>that the Apo&s;tle means, what they call, a matrimonial holine&s;s.</Q> And that the meaning of the text is, <Q>The unbelieving hu&s;band is married or e&s;pou&s;ed to the wife, and the unbelieving wife mar|ried to the hu&s;band: el&s;e were your children ba&s;tards, but now are they legitimate.</Q> I do not think it will
<PB N="31" REF="022944_0032_0FBAC5DC330CFC28">
be needful to &s;ay much to expo&s;e the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this interpretation. It is &s;o &s;trained and unnatural, it &s;o &s;inks and &s;poils the &s;en&s;e, and is &s;o utterly without foundation, that I think it may pa&s;s for one of the mo&s;t improbable, unhand&s;ome, and incredible glo&s;&s;es, that we &s;hall readily meet with upon any text whatever. Neither the Corinthians, nor any one el&s;e doubted, or had need to be told, that the unbelieving hu&s;band had been and was married to the wife, and the unbelieving wife to the hu&s;band. For, how could they be hu&s;band and wife, if they had not been married together? And, can any one believe in &s;ober earne&s;t, that the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle filled up his epi&s;tle with &s;uch a trifling ridicu|lous bu&s;ine&s;s, as telling his converts, that if they had children without being married, the children would be ba&s;tards, but now as they had been married, they were legitimate? Far be it from any chri&s;tian to burle&s;que the &s;acred &s;criptures, at this rate.&mdash;A profane infidel, who would ridicule the Apo&s;tle, could &s;carce give his words a meaner, and more ludicrous turn.</P>
<P>THAT the infant &s;eed of believers are members of the church, and &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, further appears from their intere&s;t in that gracious covenant, by which the church is con&s;tituted. To &s;tate and clear up this argu|ment at full length, would require a large di&s;cour&s;e. I mu&s;t only give a brief &s;ketch.</P>
<P>I think it is granted, that all who are vi&s;ibly intere&s;t|ed in the new covenant, are to be received as members of the vi&s;ible church; and that the outward token of an intere&s;t in the covenant, and of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;i|ble church belongs to them. After the fall of man, by the breach of the fir&s;t covenant, God was plea&s;ed to re|veal a new and gracious covenant, of which Chri&s;t was the Mediator; which was to be the rule of intercour&s;e and communion between God and his people, and the great charter by which the church was formed. All who were taken into this covenant were thereby &s;epa|rated
<PB N="32" REF="022944_0033_0FBAC5DF904F56B8">
from the re&s;t of mankind, and brought into a pe|culiar relation to God, as his people and &s;ubjects, to be ruled by the &s;pecial laws, and ob&s;erve the &s;pecial ordi|nances, and enjoy the &s;pecial privileges of his kingdom. This kingdom of grace was to make an outward ap|pearance upon earth, and have an outward admini&s;tra|tion in the vi&s;ible church, according to the rules which God ordained. And according to the&s;e rules, all who were vi&s;ibly in the covenant, were to be admitted as members of the vi&s;ible church. They were to have the appointed token of the covenant put upon them, and were vi&s;ible &s;ubjects of the outward ordinances and pri|vileges of the church. For, a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the co|venant, a right of member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible church, a right to the token of the covenant and of church mem|ber&s;hip, and to the outward ordinances and privileges, which, according to the covenant, belong to the church; the&s;e things are in&s;eparably connected together, and mu|tually infer each other. Many, it is true, who are in the covenant vi&s;ibly, and in the acceptation of the church, have not a real and &s;aving intere&s;t in new cove|nant ble&s;&s;ings. They will not at la&s;t be owned by God as his peculiar people; nor is there a &s;piritual, effectual, and &s;aving application of the grace of the new covenant to them. Hence ari&s;es the common di&s;tinction between the vi&s;ible, and the invi&s;ible church.</P>
<P>Now, if this covenant, by which the church is formed and con&s;tituted, includes the children with the parents, then the token of the covenant, and of admi&s;&s;ion into the church, belongs regularly and vi&s;ibly to them. This then is the point we have to prove.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered, in the fir&s;t place, that the &s;up|po&s;ition of infants being comprehended in the covenant, and being the &s;ubjects of its outward admini&s;tration in the vi&s;ible church, is no ways incredible, on account of any incapacity in them. For, they are certainly capa|ble of coming under its bonds, and having the grace of it &s;ecured and applied to them; and they greatly need new covenant ble&s;&s;ings. It is an important privilege to
<PB N="33" REF="022944_0034_0FBAC5E0B8309138">
them to belong to the vi&s;ible church, that they may, under its watch, in&s;tructions, and di&s;cipline, be trained up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. They are al&s;o capable of having the outward token of the co|venant put upon them; which may afterwards be im|proved by them for their excitement and encouragement in the &s;ervice of God. In &s;hort, infants are, for ought that appears, as capable &s;ubjects as any, of the obligati|ons, the privileges, and token of the covenant; and they &s;tand in like need thereof with others. The pre&s;ump|tion, therefore, is not at all again&s;t, but rather in favour of their being comprehended in the covenant, as well as others.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve, that it has always been cu|&s;tomary for children to be included in covenants with the parents; to come under the bonds, and receive the pri|vileges therein &s;tipulated. That this is common in co|venants which take place among mankind, is known to all; and no one imagines there is any thing unrea&s;onable and improper in it, if the covenant be in it&s;elf good and rea&s;onable. It is al&s;o certain, that when God has been plea&s;ed to covenant with mankind, the children as well as the parents have been comprehended. This appears to have been the ca&s;e in the covenant with Adam, with Noah, with Abraham, and with the I&s;raelites at Horeb. Indeed, this &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e in all God's fe|deral tran&s;actions with the children of men. It is, there|fore, altogether agreeable to the common &s;en&s;e of man|kind, and the method of God's government of his peo|ple, that his covenant with them &s;hould re&s;pect and take in both them and their &s;eed. And this con&s;ideration may, I think, render it quite credible and probable that the new covenant, by which the church is con&s;tituted, may be, in this re&s;pect, &s;imilar to God's covenant tran&s;|actions with mankind, which, &s;o far as appears, have con|&s;tantly comprehended the children with the parents.</P>
<P>But, having premi&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall pro|ceed to the direct and po&s;itive proof, that the children of God's covenant people, have al&s;o an intere&s;t in the covenant. The new covenant, which, I have &s;aid, is
<PB N="34" REF="022944_0035_0FBAC5E235B64A38">
the great charter by which the church is formed, do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t plainly and expre&s;sly take them in. It was, in|deed, this new covenant I am &s;peaking of, that was re|vealed to our fir&s;t parents the very day that they fell, and by the propo&s;al of it to them, they were con&s;tituted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;ible church and people of God, before they were ex|pelled from paradi&s;e.&mdash;It was again revealed to Noah af|ter the flood, whereby he, with his children, were again recognized by God as his church and people. The &s;ame covenant was afterwards more clearly and di&s;tinctly re|vealed to Abraham, and the ordinance of circumci&s;ion was annexed, as an outward &s;ign and token. And though there are &s;ufficient intimations, that the &s;eed of God's vi&s;ible and profe&s;&s;ed people, had always, from the beginning, been con&s;idered as in the covenant, and church of God; yet as this is mo&s;t expre&s;sly declared in the revelation which God made of his gracious cove|nant to Abraham, I &s;hall take this more e&s;pecially as the ground of the pre&s;ent argument.</P>
<P>The Abrahamic covenant, I &s;ay, was but a plainer ex|hibition of that &s;ame new and gracious covenant, which had been all along the foundation and charter of the church. The addition of a new ordinance, and the grant of a particular country to him and his natural po&s;terity, made no alteration in its &s;ub&s;tantial duties, or privileges, but only pointed out a different external ad|mini&s;tration, which was to take place in the church. Hitherto the external admini&s;tration of the church &s;eems to have been dome&s;tic; the ordinances of wor&s;hip being di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately admini&s;tered in the &s;everal fami|lies of the Patriarchs: nor do we read of &s;olemn a&s;&s;em|blies, for the purpo&s;e of attending public wor&s;hip. But, as God had a de&s;ign of forming a national church, of the po&s;terity of Abraham, all the members of which were to join and have an external communion with each other in the &s;ame ordinances, and acts of wor&s;hip; this different mode of admini&s;tration was provided for in the grant of the land of Canaan to the po&s;terity of Abra|ham; that &s;o they might be formed into a political bo|dy, and live together, for their convenient attendance
<PB N="35" REF="022944_0036_0FBAC5E3D80D0F08">
on holy ordinances. But this provi&s;ion, which was made for a different external admini&s;tration in the church, is no argument but that the covenant which was revealed to Abraham was, for &s;ub&s;tance, the very &s;ame with that by which the church had at fir&s;t been formed, and had all along &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>This may &s;hew how unrea&s;onably &s;ome would in&s;inu|ate, that we would make &s;everal covenants of grace. As if the &s;ame covenant could not be revealed <Q>at &s;un|dry times, and in divers manners,</Q> and, as if there might not be a different external admini&s;tration of ordi|nances in the church at different times, and yet the co|venant by which the church is con&s;tituted remain &s;ub|&s;tantially the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now, that we may di&s;tinctly &s;tate this argument, grounded on the covenant with Abraham, let us take a view of it as we have it recorded in Gen. xvii. <Q>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. As for me, my covenant is with thee, and thou &s;halt be a father of many nations. Neither &s;hall thy name any more be Abram, but thy name &s;hall be Abra|ham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and Kings &s;hall come out of thee.&mdash;And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee in their generations, for an everla&s;ting covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee, the land in which thou art a &s;tranger; all the land of Canaan for an everla&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and I will be their God. Thou &s;halt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy &s;eed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant which ye &s;hall keep between me and you, and thy &s;eed after thee: Every man child among you &s;hall be cir|cumci&s;ed. And ye &s;hall circumci&s;e the fle&s;h of your fore&s;kin, and it &s;hall be a token of the covenant be|twixt me and you. And he that is eight days old
<PB N="36" REF="022944_0037_0FBAC5E896B27C60">
&s;hall be circumci&s;ed among you, every man child i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your generations; he that is born in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> bought with money of any &s;tranger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> thy &s;eed. He that is born in thy hou&s;e, and he that is bought with thy money, mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed; and my covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an everla&s;t|ing covenant. And the uncircumci&s;ed man child who&s;e fle&s;h of his fore&s;kin is not circumci&s;ed, that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</Q></P>
<P>From this memorable pa&s;&s;age, which I have recited at large, we &s;ee that the Abrahamic covenant compre|hended the children with the parents, in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations; and that the outward token of an intere&s;t in the covenant was to be applied to infants. We may further ob&s;erve, that all who were included in this co|venant were by it con&s;tituted a vi&s;ible church, &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world to be the people of God. That grand article of the covenant, <Q>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed,</Q> implies, that they were to &s;tand in a peculiar relation to God, as his church; who were to be &s;ubject to peculiar laws and ordinances, by ob&s;erv|ing which, they declared on their part, That they were his People. This promi&s;e contains al&s;o the &s;um of new covenant ble&s;&s;ings. The promi&s;es and ordinances did ap|pertain only to the church; of which all who had an in|tere&s;t in the covenant were members. Infants, therefore, being expre&s;sly included in the covenant, were always looked upon as of the people of God; and were to re|ceive the di&s;tingui&s;hing token of a covenant dedication to him.</P>
<P>Nor was this covenant, with its ordinances and privi|eges, ever limited to Abraham, and his natural po&s;teri|ty, and particularly that article which takes the infant &s;eed into the church with the parents, was not any pecu|liar privilege of the native Hebrews: nor was circumci|&s;ion appointed as the token of a peculiar intere&s;t in tho&s;e temporal ble&s;&s;ings, which were granted exclu&s;ively to the natural &s;eed of Abraham, as &s;ome would pretend. For it appears that by the expre&s;s direction of God &s;ome
<PB N="37" REF="022944_0038_0FBAC5E9AE3E4990">
were to have the token of the covenant and of church member&s;hip for them&s;elves and their children, who were neither the natural de&s;cendants of Abraham, nor were with them to inherit the land of Canaan. When cir|cumci&s;ion was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, not only Abraham, with his &s;on I&s;hmael, but all the males of his family were or|dered to have this token of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church. And it was a &s;tanding rule, that bought &s;er|vants, and children born in the hou&s;e, &s;hould be circum|ci&s;ed. And the Old Te&s;tament church did receive pro|&s;elytes from the Gentiles; and this token of their intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham was accordingly admini&s;ter|ed to them and their children; who were thereupon &s;ub|jects of Church ordinances and privileges. But this their intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham gave them no right of inheritance with the native I&s;raelites in the land of Canaan. Which I think is a clear proof, that the covenant with Abraham, to which circumci&s;ion was an|nexed, was not any mere national covenant, conveying peculiar temporal privileges to him and his po&s;terity, but it could be no other than God's new and gracious covenant; by the revelation of which, tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;&s;edly con&s;ented to it, with their children, were con&s;ti|tuted his vi&s;ible church and people, and were the regular &s;ubjects of the ordinances appertaining to its outward admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Abrahamic covenant, we &s;ee, did comprehend both parents and their infant children, con&s;tituting them members of the vi&s;ible church. And not only the na|tural children of Abraham, but many among the Gen|tiles, upon their becoming pro&s;elytes, profe&s;&s;ing the faith and religion of the church, they and their infant children had an intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham, and were to be received into the vi&s;ible church by the initiating rite. They were adopted into the family of Abraham, and, <Q>the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham came upon the Gentiles," and he was "made the father of ma|ny nations,</Q> long before the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation took place, and before the di&s;&s;olution of the national hierar|chy of the Jews, which was a middle wall of partition
<PB N="38" REF="022944_0039_0FBAC5EB4C2FFEC0">
between them and the Gentiles. Even before this wall was taken away, there was a door left open in it, to re|ceive all of every nation, who would join them&s;elves to the God of Abraham, and take hold of his covenant.</P>
<P>The church having been con&s;tituted, according to the covenant with Abraham, it mu&s;t be allowed, that during its continuance, the children are as evidently in cove|nant, and of the church, and &s;ubjects of the initiating ordinance, as any others. If then it &s;hall appear, that this covenant &s;tands now in force, and that the go&s;pel church is in and under it, and enjoys all its privileges without any abridgement; the right of infants to church member&s;hip will &s;tand upon the &s;ame firm ba&s;is that it did under the Old T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tament.</P>
<P>But our opponents deny, <Q>that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion.</Q> And if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e with them, that it does not, it would be no proof but that the covenant it&s;elf may remain, though the out|ward token be laid a&s;ide, as it is certain that the &s;ame covenant for &s;ub&s;tance had been revealed to, and admi|ni&s;tered in the church, long before circumci&s;ion was in|&s;tituted. And if the covenant remain, infants are &s;till fit to be church members, and con&s;equently are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. But, indeed, it is no better than wrangling, to deny that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion: what we mean by the a&s;&s;er|tion is, that circumci&s;ion being abrogated under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted to be an outward token of an intere&s;t in the new covenant, the &s;acramental rite of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, the &s;ign and badge of member&s;hip, even as circumci&s;ion had been to the fathers; and in a word, that it an&s;wers the like purpo&s;es in the go&s;pel church, and is of like my|&s;tical and &s;piritual &s;ignificancy, as circumci&s;ion was under the former di&s;pen&s;ation. And this I &s;hould think our adver&s;aries can &s;carcely deny.</P>
<P>Indeed, as circumci&s;ion was afterwards annexed to the Horeb covenant, and &s;o became an ordinance of the na|tional church, and worldly &s;anctuary of the Jews, bind|ing the &s;ubjects to the ob&s;ervance of the whole of the
<PB N="39" REF="022944_0040_0FBAC5EEA1743580">
Mo&s;aic law, in this relation and re&s;pect, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e have cea&s;ed with the other Jewi&s;h ordinances, when that old covenant was abrogated.&mdash;And if our op|ponents only mean to deny, that bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion, con&s;idered as a Mo&s;aic ordinance, we &s;hall not contend with them. But it &s;hould be re|membered, that circumci&s;ion had been appointed as a token of the Abrahamic covenant, long before the Ho|reb covenant and national con&s;titution of the church had a being. And I &s;hall &s;hew, that the Abrahamic cove|nant was the very &s;ame that the go&s;pel church is now un|der; and that it never was annulled.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That the Apo&s;tle has declared, that the covenant, which was the foundation of the Jew|i&s;h church, of which infants were members, is waxed old, and vani&s;hed away,</Q> Heb. viii. 8, 9. I an&s;wer, The covenant which the Apo&s;tle &s;ays was ready to va|ni&s;h, was that which God made with the Fathers, in the day that he took them by the hand, to lead them out of Egypt; that is, the covenant at Horeb. But that co|venant, which is the foundation of infant church mem|ber&s;hip, had been revealed to Abraham hundreds of years before; and the Apo&s;tle does not &s;ay, that this had waxed old, or was annulled; but the contrary. In|fants were indeed members of the national hierarchy of the Jews, which is aboli&s;hed. But they had been church members long before this national church was formed; nor was the foundation of their member&s;hip &s;haken, when that di&s;pen&s;ation was taken away.</P>
<P>Let it then be con&s;idered, that the covenant of Abra|ham, containing a charter of privileges for the church, and the right of member&s;hip for infant children, being an undoubted privilege granted in this covenant; it mu&s;t be pre&s;umptuous and injurious for any to deny that this covenant &s;tands in force, or to pretend that infants are now cut off from this right and privilege, unle&s;s they can prove, that God has taken away this covenant, or at lea&s;t has cancelled that article, which is the foundation of infant church member&s;hip. But there is no intima|tion in the &s;criptures that this covenant is annulled, or
<PB N="40" REF="022944_0041_0FBAC5F0A75A0920">
that infants are cut off from their intere&s;t in it. The old covenant which the Apo&s;tle &s;ays was vani&s;hing, was the covenant made with the I&s;raelites, when God led them out of Egypt. But of the aboli&s;hing that cove|nant which con&s;titutes infants, church members, there is nothing to be found in the whole Bible. And, till it can be proved to be aboli&s;hed, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered and held as valid as ever.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles are &s;o far from teaching, that Chri&s;t has annulled God's gracious covenant with the fathers, or taken away any of the privileges therein granted to them or their children, that Paul a&s;&s;erts the contrary, in Rom. xv. 8, <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a mini&s;ter of the circum|ci&s;ion, for the truth of God, to confirm the promi&s;es made to the fathers.</Q> The&s;e promi&s;es are &s;ummarily contained in the covenant with Abraham, that the Lord would be a God to him and his &s;eed; that he &s;hould be a father of many nations; and that all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in him. The&s;e promi&s;es are all confirmed by Chri&s;t. Abraham is the patriarch of the church. He is con&s;titated the father of all them that believe; of all the people of God, of every nation; who are adopted into his family. Even the Gentiles, who were not his natural de&s;cendants, are received into the number, and entitled to the privileges of his children. He is made the father of more nations, than are derived from his blood. All the nations of the earth derive ble&s;&s;ings from him, and hold their church privileges un|der him, as his children and heirs. The covenant with Abraham has, indeed, been accompli&s;hed more eminent|ly &s;ince Chri&s;t confirmed it, than ever before. His fa|mily has been larger, and he has been made a father of more nations than ever. This article of the covenant, which receives the children with the parents into the church, is confirmed, as well as the re&s;t. It would be mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to think otherwi&s;e, when the &s;crip|tures never hint that this article is re&s;cinded.&mdash;And we have, be&s;ides, good evidence, that the chri&s;tian church has not lo&s;t this privilege, but their children are &s;till chil|dren of the covenant, to greater advantage than ever.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="022944_0042_0FBAC5F213134918">The Apo&s;tle tells us again, <Q>That the covenant with Abraham was confirmed of God in Chri&s;t, and that the law which was four hundred and thirty years af|ter, could not di&s;annul it,</Q> Gal. iii. 17. And will any yet in&s;inuate, that Chri&s;t has annulled this covenant, which God confirmed in him? This would overthrow the Apo&s;tle's argument; who confutes the error of the Judaizing teachers about ju&s;tification, by the &s;tability of the Abrahamic covenant; which would be inconclu&s;ive, if that covenant was not in force.</P>
<P>Indeed, the third chapter to the Galatians, and fourth to the Romans are a proof, that the covenant with Abraham abides in force, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, and that the Gentile believers, with their chil|dren, have an intere&s;t in it which can never be evaded. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that <Q>They who are of faith, are the children of Abraham, and are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 7.9.</NOTE></Q> And being his adopted children, they are heirs. They inherit the ble&s;&s;ings of his covenant; and all tho&s;e privileges of church member&s;hip, which were granted to Abraham and his &s;eed, belong to be|lievers. And as it was one covenant privilege of the children of Abraham, to have their infant children taken into the covenant and church with them: this privilege is tran&s;mitted by the covenant, to all who are adopted into the family of Abraham; otherwi&s;e they are cut off from a part of that inheritance of church privileges which was entailed upon the children of Abraham. The Apo&s;tle adds, <Q>The ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham is come upon the Gentiles, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 14.</NOTE></Q> Which is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s if he had &s;aid, the ble&s;&s;ings and privileges granted in the covenant with Abraham belong and are conveyed to the Gentile church.

and their &s;eed, the chri&s;tian Gentiles are entitled to. For they are al&s;o declared to be the children and heirs of Abraham. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e the Apo&s;tle writes in the fourth chapter to the Romans, quoting tho&s;e words of the covenant, <Q>I have made thee a fa|ther of many nations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 16, 17.</NOTE></Q> as a proof, that Gentile be|lievers are the children of Abraham; and con&s;equently are comprehended in the covenant and church, together with their offspring.</P>
<P>Again, in Eph. iii. 6, we read, <Q>That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the &s;ame body, and partakers of the promi&s;e in Chri&s;t, by the go&s;pel.</Q> That is, they are fellow-heirs with the Jews of the ble&s;&s;ing and covenant of Abraham, they are admitted to that inheri|tance of &s;piritual privileges, which God's covenant and promi&s;e conveyed to his de&s;cendants; they are of the &s;ame body the church, which was formed by this cove|nant; and partakers of the promi&s;e; that &s;ame promi&s;e of the covenant which had been the great privilege of the church all along, and was expre&s;sly to them and their children.</P>
<P>But, let us once more hear what the &s;cripture &s;ays.&mdash; When tho&s;e, who were pricked in their hearts, on the day of Penteco&s;t, &s;aid to Peter and the re&s;t of the Apo|&s;tles, <Q>Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do? Peter &s;aid unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For the promi&s;e is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call,</Q> Acts ii. 37, 38, 39. That it was the covenant with Abraham, that is here called the pro|mi&s;e, will appear from the following con&s;iderations.&mdash; 1. This covenant is commonly in the New Te&s;tament called the Promi&s;e, by way of di&s;tinction and eminency. See Rom. iv. 13, 14, <Q>For the promi&s;e, that he &s;hould be heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his &s;eed, through the law, but through the righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="43" REF="022944_0044_0FBAC5F55585FE98">
of faith. For, if they which are of the law, be heirs, faith is made void, and the Promi&s;e of none effect. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end that the Promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the fa|ther of us all." Gal. iii. 17, &amp;c. "The covenant which was before confirmed of God in Chri&s;t, the law which was 430 years after cannot di&s;annul, that it &s;hould make the promi&s;e of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promi&s;e, but God gave it to Abraham by Promi&s;e. If ye are Chri&s;t's then are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs ac|cording to the Promi&s;e." Once more. Gal. iv. 28, We, as I&s;aac, are children of the Promi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>In all the&s;e places, and in divers others, the covenant with Abraham is called the Promi&s;e; which &s;hews that it was commonly &s;o &s;tiled. 2. If we compare this text with Acts iii. 25, we &s;hall find the promi&s;e there ex|plained, to mean the covenant with Abraham. For the Apo&s;tle, there addre&s;&s;ing the Jews, to per&s;uade them to repent and be converted, in like manner as he had done on the day of Penteco&s;t, propo&s;es the very &s;ame encou|ragement to them in the&s;e words: <Q>Ye are the chil|dren of the covenant which God made with our fa|thers, &s;aying unto Abraham, And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the kindreds of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> His telling them that <Q>they were the children of Abraham's cove|nant,</Q> is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e exactly, as if he had told them, that the Promi&s;e was to them and their chil|dren. For this covenant was undoubtedly to the parents and their infant children. And their being declared children of the covenant, &s;ignified that they were heirs to the privileges of the covenant. So that the&s;e texts are exactly parallel, and explain each other. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle, preaching to the &s;ame &s;ort of hearers (that is, the Jews) propo&s;es the &s;ame argument in different words, even their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e, or covenant with Abraham, in order to enforce the &s;ame exhorta|tion, viz. Repentance and conver&s;ion for the remi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="44" REF="022944_0045_0FBAC5F7A30A4A88">
of &s;ins. So that we cannot rea&s;onably doubt, whether the promi&s;e here &s;poken of, be not the covenant with Abraham, if we will allow the Apo&s;tle to explain his own words. 3. What the Apo&s;tle here &s;ays of the pro|mi&s;e, agrees exactly in every particular, with the Abra|hamic covenant, which had all along included the po|&s;terity of Abraham and their infant children, together with the Gentiles that were afar off, even as many of them, as the Lord did from time to time call into his church, and who, in obedience to his call, became pro|&s;elytes, or Comers, as the word properly &s;ignifies.&mdash; All who, upon the divine call, came from afar to join them&s;elves to the Lord, and his people, were received, together with their children, into the church and cove|nant by circumci&s;ion; and the promi&s;e was to them and their children al&s;o, as has been ob&s;erved. The covenant of Abraham did belong to all tho&s;e who were in, and of the church. Peter's hearers, with their children, be|ing actual members in the church, did not need a new call into the church, in order to their being the children of the covenant and promi&s;e. But, with the Gentiles who were afar off, and out of the church, the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e. They mu&s;t fir&s;t be called in, and become pro&s;elytes, before the promi&s;e would be to them and theirs. But &s;o many as were thus called, and admitted into the family of Abraham, had an intere&s;t in the covenant and promi&s;e, as well as the Jews. Thus the ca&s;e had &s;tood all along according to the Abrahamic co|venant; and thus the ca&s;e &s;tood upon the day of Pente|co&s;t, as Peter &s;ays. Which &s;hews that it was this cove|nant that Peter had in his eye, when he &s;aid, <Q>The promi&s;e is to you and your children:</Q> that his words are therefore to be explained according to the tenor of the Abrahamic covenant. That this covenant, which is the foundation of infant church member&s;hip, was not then aboli&s;hed: but &s;tood in force: and I pre&s;ume no one will &s;ay it has been aboli&s;hed &s;ince.</P>
<P>In this manner Peter's hearers mu&s;t have under&s;tood his words. They had been born and bred in that church and covenant, which included both parents and
<PB N="45" REF="022944_0046_0FBAC5FA1AB53820">
children. They knew that infants had always been ac|knowledged as church members, ever &s;ince a church had been formed in the world. The idea of a church which &s;hould not admit the children with the parents, would have been as new and &s;trange to them, as a church that would not admit females, would be to us. A pro|mi&s;e, or covenant, conveying privileges to them and their children, would be naturally under&s;tood by them in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e promi&s;es in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, which &s;o often occur in the &s;ame form of expre&s;&s;i|on, had con&s;tantly been taken; and particularly the pro|mi&s;e to Abraham, which was the mo&s;t eminent and fun|damental. They would as naturally conclude that their young children are immediately re&s;pected, as we &s;hould conclude ours to be in an in&s;trument, conveying privi|leges to us and our heirs; and they would have no doubt, that a grant of privileges was here a&s;&s;erted to the chil|dren of tho&s;e who were in the covenant and church, more than to the children of heathens. Now as the words of the Apo&s;tle would carry this meaning mo&s;t na|turally and obviou&s;ly to the under&s;tanding of his hear|ers, and as the &s;ame form of expre&s;&s;ion el&s;ewhere is con|&s;tantly to be thus under&s;tood, and no rea&s;on appears why it may not be taken here in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e: this mu&s;t in all rea&s;on be received as the true intrepretation. And if this promi&s;e belonged to the infant children of the inchurched and covenanted Jews, at the day of Pente|co&s;t, none will deny that it &s;till belongs to the children of the Gentiles, who were afar off; even as many as it plea&s;es the Lord to call into his go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e Peter holds up to the Jews, as a war|rant or rea&s;on why they &s;hould be baptized in the name of Chri&s;t. Repent and be baptized; for the promi&s;e is to you, &amp;c. Now if their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e was a good rea&s;on why they &s;hould be baptized, as the Apo|&s;tle a&s;&s;erts; then their children's having an intere&s;t in the promi&s;e with them (as is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted) is as good a rea&s;on for their being baptized; even as an intere&s;t in the covenant was a rea&s;on for circumci&s;ion to Abraham and his children.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="022944_0047_0FBAC5FAF4A29818">This text is then a &s;ub&s;tantial proof that the covenant of Abraham &s;tood in force, after the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation took place: &s;ince this appears to be that very promi&s;e which Peter addre&s;&s;es to his hearers. And we &s;ee that that particular clau&s;e, which contains a grant of the privilege of church member&s;hip to the children of God's people was not taken out, when <Q>Chri&s;t the mini&s;ter of the circumci&s;ion confirmed by his death the pro|mi&s;es made to the fathers.</Q> We then, and all others, whom God &s;hall call into his church, together with our children, as the adopted children and heirs of Abraham, have an intere&s;t in this promi&s;e; are members of the go&s;|pel church; and the proper &s;ubjects of chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, <Q>that the Promi&s;e here &s;poken of, was not the covenant with Abraham, but the promi&s;e of the pouring out of the Spirit, in Joel.</Q> But how can this be, when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays that the prophecy of Joel foretold tho&s;e miraculous gifts of the Spirit, &s;peak|ing with tongues, and prophe&s;ying, which appeared on the day of Penteco&s;t? Are the&s;e gifts promi&s;ed to, and conferred upon all, whom the Lord &s;hall call? Be|&s;ides, I have proved, that the promi&s;e here mentioned, was the covenant with Abraham; and till the rea&s;ons adduced are &s;hewn to be without weight, it is folly to &s;et up an unproved a&s;&s;ertion in oppo&s;ition to them. But whatever the promi&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, it belong|ed to Peter's hearers, and their children, as he &s;ays; and he holds it up to them as a rea&s;on for their being bap|tized. It mu&s;t therefore be a rea&s;on for the bapti&s;m of their children al&s;o. If the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t was promi&s;ed to them, it was to their children. And they were to be con&s;idered as &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m on ac|count of the promi&s;e; not becau&s;e the gifts of the &s;pi|rit were manife&s;t in them, but in order to their receiv|ing the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For it is to be ob&s;erv|ed, that the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t is propo&s;ed as the con&s;equence, and not the pre-requi&s;ite of bapti&s;m. <Q>Be baptized, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="022944_0048_0FBAC5FC8DFD6008">But to give this plea the greate&s;t advantage, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the pouring out of the Spirit in his ordi|nary &s;anctifying influences is the matter of that promi&s;e in Joel, though Peter explains it otherwi&s;e: and that this is the promi&s;e, which he, in this text propo&s;es to his hearers, as re&s;pecting them and their children, though we have &s;een him explain him&s;elf otherwi&s;e.&mdash; Our argument from the&s;e words, would yet &s;tand good. For the promi&s;e of the &s;anctifying Spirit being includ|ed in the ble&s;&s;ing, we may hence infer, that they to whom this promi&s;e belongs, are intere&s;ted in the cove|nant and ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham, and may properly be re|cognized as of the church and people of God.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, <Q>That the children to whom the promi&s;e belongs, are not infants, but adults&mdash;the po|&s;terity of the Jews.</Q> But though adults are the children of their parents, yet infants too are doubtle&s;s children. What warrant then have any to deny that they have an intere&s;t in that promi&s;e, which is to the children indefinitely, without any exception of infants?</P>
<P>But the eva&s;ion which is mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on, is, <Q>That the promi&s;e is re&s;trained to tho&s;e only whom the Lord &s;hall call: and infants give no evidence of their being called.</Q> But this will not bear examination. I have already &s;hewn, that this promi&s;e was the cove|nant with Abraham, and is therefore to be explained ac|cording to the tenor of that covenant, which included him and his children, and &s;o many of the Gentiles as God &s;hould from time to time call into his church. The calling of Abraham was a &s;ufficient call to all his po&s;te|rity, to give them a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the covenant, and &s;tanding in the church, till they forfeited and were cut off from this privilege. The re&s;training clau&s;e, therefore, only re&s;pected tho&s;e who were not yet called into the church of God, and not tho&s;e Jews and their children who were then actual members and children of the covenant. Repentance and bapti&s;m in the name of Chri&s;t, were required to prevent their being cut off from the covenant and family of Abraham; but the promi&s;e was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to them and their children. There is a plain

rea&s;on why the promi&s;e &s;hould re&s;pect only &s;o many of tho&s;e who are without, as the Lord &s;hould call into his church. But how ab&s;urdly would the Apo&s;tle &s;peak, according to the interpretation which the Antipedobap|ti&s;ts put upon his words.&mdash;<Q>The promi&s;e is to you and your children. But neither you nor your children, appear at pre&s;ent to have any intere&s;t in it; and no one knows, that they ever will have. You are not to imagine that either you or your children are entitled to any privilege by it, more than belongs to every man and child in the world. All that I mean is, that the promi&s;e will belong to tho&s;e who &s;hall be called. If this &s;hould prove to be the ca&s;e with any of you, or of your children, or any other per&s;on, then, and not till then, the promi&s;e will be to you and them.</Q> If this be all that is intended, it had been much more plain|ly expre&s;&s;ed by only &s;aying, <Q>The promi&s;e will be to tho&s;e whom the Lord &s;hall call.</Q> To what purpo&s;e is all this flouri&s;h of words, without meaning? What end can this particular mention of them, and their chil|dren, as intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, &s;erve, unle&s;s to per|&s;uade them, that &s;ome &s;pecial privilege belonged to them, while there was nothing at all in it? It is either in&s;ig|nificant or fallacious; and would convey to the under|&s;tanding of the hearers either no meaning, or a fal&s;e one.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it were declared, that all the privileges con|tained in our frame of government belonged to the na|tive &s;ubjects and their children, and al&s;o to foreigners, even as many as the government &s;hould naturalize: and &s;ome one pretending to give the &s;en&s;e of this declarati|on &s;hould contend, that according to it, neither the na|tive &s;ubjects, nor their children, had a right to any of the&s;e privileges, unle&s;s they &s;hould be fir&s;t naturalized by an act of the government; would he not be thought ri|dicuou&s;ly ab&s;urd? The adver&s;aries of infant church member&s;hip are equally ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable, in their way of explaining the Apo&s;tle's words.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="022944_0050_0FBAC60203740C68">
add, that &s;ince it is on all hands allowed to have been a great privilege of the Jewi&s;h infants, that they were in the covenant and church of God; if the infants of chri|&s;tians are left out of the church, as &s;ome teach, then the go&s;pel church is deprived of an important privilege, which the Jewi&s;h church enjoyed: and its con&s;titution is le&s;s favourable to infants. But can we believe, that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation has dimini&s;hed the privileges of the church in any in&s;tance; or that it has put any cla&s;s of mankind, whether infants or adults, in a more di&s;ad|vantageous &s;tate than before; depriving them, without any fault of theirs, of their &s;tanding in the church of God, which is acknowledged to have been an import|ant privilege? This ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, unle&s;s clear and po&s;itive proof of it could be produced. But no &s;uch proof has been or can be found. Wherefore, to bring this argument to a point: the privilege of church member&s;hip has certainly been granted to the infant chil|dren of God's profe&s;&s;ing people; which grant &s;tands in force till it be revoked. Our opponents have often been called upon to produce an authentic act of revocation, and the demand is rea&s;onable. This they cannot do. On the contrary, we demon&s;trate, that this grant has not been revoked, but is renewed, confirmed, and rati|fied in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>As a proper appendix to what has thus far been di&s;|cour&s;ed of the intere&s;t of infants in the vi&s;ible church covenant, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention that common argument from bapti&s;m &s;ucceeding in the room of circumci&s;ion; but &s;hall not enlarge upon it. As infants were the &s;ub|jects of circumci&s;ion, and were recognized and marked as the people of God by this rite, the conclu&s;ion is very natural and rea&s;onable, that if bapti&s;m comes in the place of circumci&s;ion, as the token of admi&s;&s;ion into the church, infants are the proper &s;ubjects of this ordinance; unle&s;s God has declared to the contrary, which can ne|ver be made to appear. It is indeed denied by our op|ponents, that bapti&s;m does come in the place of circum|ci&s;ion. But I cannot find that they have explained them|&s;elves di&s;tinctly, how far, and in what re&s;pect, they mean to deny it. I own that bapti&s;m does not an&s;wer
<PB N="50" REF="022944_0051_0FBAC6033423F238">
all the &s;ame purpo&s;es under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, that circumci&s;ion did under the Mo&s;aic. It does not intro|duce the &s;ubjects into a national church, and worldly &s;anctuary. It has not a typical re&s;pect to the Saviour to come. It is not a yoke of bondage, obliging to the ob&s;ervance of the carnal ordinances of the law of Mo&s;es. And our opponents, if they will be ingenuous and rea|&s;onable, mu&s;t allow that bapti&s;m does, in many re&s;pects, come in the place of circumci&s;ion. It an&s;wers &s;imilar ends in the go&s;pel church; and is of the &s;ame general &s;ignification; and is to be applied to the &s;ame &s;ubjects; and has even the &s;ame name given to it; and upon the in&s;titution of bapti&s;m, as an ordinance, of &s;tanding and univer&s;al obligation, circumci&s;ion was no longer the token of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church, as it had been before. And this is all we mean, when we a&s;&s;ert, that bapti&s;m &s;ucceeds to circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>As circumci&s;ion was the outward token of the cove|nant, and of admi&s;&s;ion into the church; &s;o bapti&s;m is the outward token of church member&s;hip, and of an in|tere&s;t in the new covenant; which I have proved, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame with that of Abraham, to which circumci&s;ion was annexed. They are both the appoint|ed outward &s;ign and badge of the people of God. As circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith to Abraham, &s;o is bapti&s;m to chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Again, circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m though different in external rites, are alike in their &s;piritual &s;ignification. They both pointed out our native corruption, and need of purification, by an inward and &s;piritual renovation. They both &s;ignified clean&s;ing from the guilt and defile|ment of &s;in by the blood of Chri&s;t, an admi&s;&s;ion into the church, a dedication to God, an obligation to walk in his commandments and ordinances, and a right to co|venant privileges.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved, that the Apo&s;tle calls chri&s;tians the Circumci&s;ion, under the go&s;pel; which was the common appellation of tho&s;e who had, under the former di&s;pen&s;ation, received the token of induction in|to
<PB N="51" REF="022944_0052_0FBAC604AE91C0C0">
the church. A &s;ufficient intimation that the one takes the place of the other.</P>
<P>Accordingly, circumci&s;ion cea&s;ed to be longer the token of church member&s;hip, after Chri&s;t &s;ent out his Apo&s;tles to preach and baptize in his name, when bap|ti&s;m was made the &s;tanding rite of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, we cannot but con&s;ider bapti&s;m as taking that place in the go&s;pel oeconomy, in which cir|cumci&s;ion &s;tood under the old di&s;pen&s;ation; though we readily allow that each of the&s;e ordinances had &s;ome pe|culiar ends and &s;ignifications, &s;uited to the different &s;tates of the church, in which they were re&s;pectively in force; in re&s;pect of which peculiarities, they may not properly be parallel. And hence we argue, that &s;ince circumci&s;i|on and bapti&s;m are manife&s;tly &s;imilar in their main ends, u&s;es, and &s;ignificancies; infants are as proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, as they were of circumci&s;ion; and that the divine order for admini&s;tering the one ordinance to them, warrants our admini&s;tering that other ordinance that comes in its room. And the argument is not only po|pular, but of real weight; though I do not lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That the outward rites are very un|like.</Q> But I can &s;ee no weight in this. The dif|ferent &s;tates of the church under the Old and New Te&s;tament might require this difference of outward ad|mini&s;tration re&s;pecting the initiating rite.</P>
<P>It is further objected, <Q>That the &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m and circumci&s;ion were different. Circumci&s;ion was to be admini&s;tered only to males, bapti&s;m to both &s;exes.</Q> I an&s;wer, The circumci&s;ion of the males was the appointed token of church member&s;hip to the peo|ple of God of both &s;exes. The females were account|ed of the circumci&s;ion; and were admitted to the holy ordinances which were interdicted to the uncircumci&s;ed and unclean.</P>
<P>It is objected again, <Q>That bapti&s;m was in u&s;e and force before circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed.</Q> I an&s;wer, Though bapti&s;m was admini&s;tered by John, and the
<PB N="52" REF="022944_0053_0FBAC608860AC0C0">
di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, a &s;hort time before circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed, yet this no more proves that the former &s;uc|ceeds not in the room of the latter, than Solomon's reigning with his father a &s;hort time, is a proof that he did not &s;ucceed and reign in his &s;tead. But though bap|ti&s;m was in u&s;e before, it was not fully e&s;tabli&s;hed as the rite of induction into the church, till the mi&s;&s;ion of the Apo&s;tles; after which, circumci&s;ion was no longer re|quired for that purpo&s;e, as it had been before; though for other rea&s;ons it continued in u&s;e among the believ|ing Jews &s;ome years longer.</P>
<P>It is further inquired, <Q>What need there was that tho&s;e who had been circumci&s;ed &s;hould be baptized, if they are both ordinances of the &s;ame u&s;e and &s;ig|nificancy?</Q> I an&s;wer, It was the will of Chri&s;t, that all his di&s;ciples &s;hould receive the new token and badge of church member&s;hip, although they had been ad|mitted members of the Old Te&s;tament church. And &s;uch as would not recognize them&s;elves as his di&s;ciples, were to be rejected, and unchurched, and be as branches bro|ken off by their unbelief. Their circumci&s;ion became uncircumci&s;ion, and the token of their being the people of God became null and void.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;criptural arguments in favour of infant church member&s;hip, I &s;hall add another con&s;ideration, which &s;eems to me to have great weight.</P>
<P>The Jews certainly knew that their infants had an intere&s;t in the covenant of Abraham, and had always been acknowledged, received, and recognized by cir|cumci&s;ion, as being of the church and people of God. If the Apo&s;tles had taught that infants were no longer to have an intere&s;t in God's covenant, or be members of the church, or receive any token of their being the people of God; the doctrine mu&s;t have been new, &s;trange, very &s;hocking and offen&s;ive to the Jews. They mu&s;t certainly have taken notice of it, and been greatly di&s;plea&s;ed at it. They oppo&s;ed the Apo&s;tles with all their might, and did all in their power to render them odious, and &s;et the people again&s;t them and their new doctrine. They were ready to take offence, and wanted
<PB N="53" REF="022944_0054_0FBAC60A06713F08">
neither wit nor will to lay hold of and exaggerate a plau&s;ible and popular objection. Such an objection they would have had, if the Apo&s;tles had denied that their children were to be church members any longer. They would not have borne &s;uch a doctrine, which declared all their children excommunicated and cut off from the church and people of the Lord, and to have no part in him; but would certainly have urged the objection with a vehemence. And the Apo&s;tles mu&s;t have &s;een, that it highly concerned them to an&s;wer the objection, and take up &s;o dangerous a &s;tumbling block, if their doc|trine had given &s;o obvious and fair a handle to their enemies again&s;t them. But we have no hint in the New Te&s;tament, or any author, Jewi&s;h, Chri&s;tian, or Heathen, that ever I could find or learn, that the Jews ever made any &s;uch objection to the Apo&s;tles, or their doctrine; or that the Apo&s;tles ever attempted either to obviate or &s;ilence it, or &s;aid one word about it: which is certainly a mo&s;t violent pre&s;umption, and may almo&s;t pa&s;s for plenary evidence, that the Apo&s;tles did not, by denying the right of church member&s;hip of infants, fur|ni&s;h an obvious occa&s;ion and ground for any &s;uch objec|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention but one argument more, grounded up|on the Hi&s;tory of Infant Bapti&s;m, and the practice of the church from the apo&s;tolic age, according to the te&s;timony of the earlie&s;t writers. The fact, in &s;hort, is found to &s;tand thus: 1. That the validity and lawfulne&s;s of infant bapti&s;m appears not to have ever been denied by any chri&s;tians till about the year 1130; and then on|ly by one Peter de Bruis in France, with his followers, a &s;mall &s;ect, which held withal, that no infants were &s;aved, and divers other gro&s;s errors, as hi&s;torians report. It &s;oon dwindled to nothing. After which, there can|not be found a &s;ingle in&s;tance, well vouched, of a per|&s;on oppo&s;ing infant bapti&s;m (except &s;uch as denied wa|ter bapti&s;m) till the Anabapti&s;ts &s;prang up in Germany about 250 years ago. To this purpo&s;e we have the te&s;timony of Doctor Wall, a learned, diligent and faith|ful writer on the &s;ubject, in his Hi&s;tory of Infant Bap|ti&s;m.
<PB N="54" REF="022944_0055_0FBAC60B782BD260">
The&s;e are his words, <Q>For the fir&s;t 400 years there appears only one man, Tertullian, that advi&s;ed the delay of infant bapti&s;m in &s;ome ca&s;es, and one Gregory that did perhaps practi&s;e &s;uch delay in the ca&s;e of his children; but no &s;ociety &s;o thinking, or &s;o prac|ti&s;ing, nor any one man &s;aying that it was unlawful to baptize infants. In the next 700 years, there in not &s;o much as one man to be found, that either &s;poke for, or practi&s;ed &s;uch delay, but all the contrary. And when about the year 1130, one &s;ect among the Walden&s;es declared again&s;t the baptizing of infants, as being incapable of &s;alvation, the main body of that people rejected their opinion; and they of them that held that opinion, quickly dwindled away, and di&s;|appeared; there being no more heard of holding that tenet, till the ri&s;ing of the German Antipedobapti&s;ts, in the year 1522.</Q> Thus far Dr. Wall. To this our opponents have hitherto found nothing to oppo&s;e, worthy of credit, except &s;ome te&s;timonies to the prac|tice of baptizing adults; which are nothing to the pur|po&s;e; &s;ince no one doubts that unbaptized adults, as well as infants, are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Or if any have been found &s;peaking again&s;t the bapti&s;m of infants, they have appeared to be &s;uch as were again&s;t all water bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the other hand, we have the expre&s;s te&s;timony of the learned Chri&s;tian writers, who lived within one, two, and three hundred years of the Apo&s;tles, that in|fant bapti&s;m was not only then commonly practi&s;ed in the church, but had been received and practi&s;ed from the Apo&s;tles; and that none were known of, among all the numerous &s;ects of Chri&s;tians, pretending to deny it.</P>
<P>The te&s;timonies of the fathers to this purpo&s;e, are commonly known by tho&s;e who are moderately ver&s;ed in this controver&s;y. Ju&s;tin Martyr, who wrote about 40 years after the Apo&s;tles, mentions expre&s;sly &s;ome aged Chri&s;tians, who were made di&s;ciples in, or from their in|fancy. And though he mentions not their infant bap|ti&s;m, his words fairly imply it. For if they were made di&s;ciples in infancy, they were doubtle&s;s the &s;ubjects of
<PB N="55" REF="022944_0056_0FBAC60D96DF3D68">
bapti&s;m. Irenaeus, who is &s;aid to have been born in the apo&s;tolic age, mentions the bapti&s;m of infants. He calls it, indeed, their regeneration;&mdash;but &s;o bapti&s;m was commonly termed by the ancient fathers, as all who are ver&s;ed in their writings know and acknowledge. Ter|tullian, who lived within 100 years of the Apo&s;tles, &s;peaks of the baptizing of infants as a practice of the church; but advi&s;es to the delay of it, except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; though he has nothing to &s;ay again&s;t the validity and lawfulne&s;s of it. He advi&s;es al&s;o the delay of bapti&s;m to adults, till they were married, or confirm|ed in continency. Though he was &s;ingular and whimfi|cal in his opinion, yet he may well be admitted as a cre|dible witne&s;s that infant bapti&s;m was a common practice in the church at that time. And this is all the u&s;e we mean to make of any of the te&s;timonies we &s;hall pro|duce.</P>
<P>Origen, who al&s;o lived within 100 years after the Apo&s;tles, and was one of the mo&s;t learned and knowing men of the age, declares, that infants are, by the u&s;age of the church, baptized. And that an order for the baptizing infants, had been delivered to the church, from the Apo&s;tles, who knew that the pollution of &s;in is in all.</P>
<P>Cyprian, who lived but little more than 100 years af|ter the Apo&s;tles, gives as full a te&s;timony as po&s;&s;ible to the practice of infant bapti&s;m at the time he lived. At a council of 66 mini&s;ters, held about 150 years after the Apo&s;tles, it was debated, whether it would not be proper to delay the baptizing of infants, till the eighth day, according to the law of circumci&s;ion. [Note, it appears they con&s;idered bapti&s;m as coming in the room of circumci&s;ion.] They were unanimou&s;ly of opinion&punc; that there was no rea&s;on for any &s;uch delay.</P>
<P>WE are now to con&s;ider the objections.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t is, <Q>that there is no command in &s;crip|ture for baptizing infants, nor can it be proved, that the Apo&s;tles baptized any &s;uch. We have expre&s;s ac|counts of the bapti&s;m of men and women; but that
<PB N="56" REF="022944_0057_0FBAC60FD87064B8">
infants were, or ought to be admitted as &s;ubjects of this ordinance, the &s;cripture &s;aith not. How can this be a divine ordinance, when there is neither precept nor precedent for it?</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, If it any way appears from the &s;cripture, that infants are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, it matters not whe|ther this doctrine be grounded on an expre&s;s precept or example, or whether it be taught in &s;ome other way. Is it not pre&s;umption for us to &s;ay, that we will not be|lieve this to be the mind of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he has re|vealed it in the particular way that we may pitch upon? The que&s;tion &s;hould be, whether we can find, or ga|ther from the &s;criptures any Sufficient evidence, that infants are to be baptized. If the rea&s;ons on which our doctrine and practice is grounded, be good and conclu|&s;ive, we ought to acquie&s;ce in them. It never can be proved, either by &s;cripture or rea&s;on, that con&s;equential evidence is in&s;ufficient to determine our judgment and practice, in matters of religion; or that every part of God's revealed will is delivered in expre&s;s propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Since the &s;criptures plainly acknowledge and a&s;&s;ert the right of member&s;hip of infants in the go&s;pel church, that they are of the number of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, that they are holy, and have an intere&s;t in God's gracious cove|nant; and &s;ince it is owned by all, that, according to the order and rule of the go&s;pel, all tho&s;e who are di&s;|ciples, holy, and in the covenant, are the proper &s;ub|jects of bapti&s;m: the con&s;equence is clear, that infants are to be baptized. And this is equivalent to an ex|pre&s;s order for it. It is as plain and valid a warrant, though it be con&s;equential, as an expre&s;s order would be.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o &s;uch precedents in favour of our prac|tice, as, though they may be cavilled at, mu&s;t, I think, be of great weight w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> every unbia&s;&s;ed man; precedents which &s;eem to render it morally certain, that infant bap|ti&s;m was practi&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles. Three whole fami|lies we read of, who were baptized. If there were any children under the age of di&s;cretion, in any of the&s;e fa|milies, they were certainly admitted. Now, though it
<PB N="57" REF="022944_0058_0FBAC6122E91B508">
be not &s;aid whether there were any &s;uch children, yet is can &s;carce be doubted that there were, when the follow|ing circum&s;tances are well con&s;idered. 1. If we &s;hould take three families among us, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, I &s;uppo&s;e the probability would be, at lea&s;t, fifty to one, that there would be young children in &s;ome of them. 2. It is not &s;aid, or intimated, that there were no &s;uch chil|dren in the&s;e families. But if it had been the ca&s;e that there were no children in the&s;e hou&s;es, and if children ought not to be baptized, there was great rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity that &s;o important and uncommon a circum|&s;tance &s;hould be mentioned, to prevent a dangerous mi&s;|take, which the&s;e accounts, left as they &s;tand, would naturally lead men into. For the bapti&s;m of the&s;e fa|milies would naturally be con&s;idered as precedents for baptizing other families, in which there were infants. And as the con&s;tant and known practice of the church for thou&s;ands of years, and the declarations of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, were in favour of infant church mem|ber&s;hip; how rea&s;onable mu&s;t it needs appear to prac|ti&s;e hou&s;ehold bapti&s;m, unle&s;s it were plainly te&s;tified and guarded again&s;t? In &s;hort, we have expre&s;s prece|dents, or examples, if not of infant bapti&s;m, yet of hou&s;ehold bapti&s;m, infants not excepted; and that too upon the faith or profe&s;&s;ion of the head of the family. For it is to be carefully noted, that in the&s;e accounts it is not &s;aid, or intimated, that all in the&s;e families were baptized on a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith; but only, that the head of the family believed, and thereupon was baptized with all the hou&s;e. And upon the authority of the&s;e precedents of family bapti&s;m, in conjunction with the other grounds which have been mentioned, we a&s;&s;ert and claim the right of hou&s;ehold bapti&s;m, on be|half of the families of believers, infants not excepted. And we challenge tho&s;e who will not admit them, to produce an authentic order or precedent for this their refu&s;al.</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel, though it has changed the initiating &s;acrament, continues infants in the &s;ame &s;tanding in the church, which it was well known they had had all
<PB N="58" REF="022944_0059_0FBAC613E1C62228">
along; it is nothing &s;trange that we have not more ex|pre&s;s orders and precedents touching infant bapti&s;m. What need of new precepts and examples to a&s;certain a point, which had in effect been long &s;ince &s;ettled; which all under&s;tood, and all agreed in? But how infinitely &s;trange would it be, if infants, who had from the begin|ning been of the church, by the appointment of God, and the &s;ubjects of the initiating ordinance, &s;hould be ca&s;t out of the church, and cut off from the people of God, without any order or precedent for it in &s;cripture? And yet this we mu&s;t believe, if we deny their right to church member&s;hip and bapti&s;m. For certainly there is neither order no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> precedent for excluding them from the church, or from the initiating rite.</P>
<P>If the Apo&s;tles had refu&s;ed to admit infants into the go&s;pel church by bapti&s;m, we &s;hould, without all per|adventure, have had a plain order not to receive them. The ca&s;e was &s;uch as mu&s;t, in all rea&s;on, have required it. Such a great and important change in the con&s;titu|tion of the church, as would cut off a great part of tho&s;e who had always been acknowledged to be in the church and covenant of God, mu&s;t have &s;eemed &s;trange to the Jewi&s;h converts; who would naturally have ex|pected that their children were &s;till to be received with them, as heretofore; and would, accordingly, have moved to have them baptized; as the ancient Jewi&s;h writers atte&s;t was commonly practi&s;ed at the admi&s;&s;ion of pro&s;elytes. At lea&s;t, they would have inquired, whether the go&s;pel church admitted infants as well as adult be|lievers; which mu&s;t have given occa&s;ion for a plain and expre&s;s determination of the point, if &s;o great and &s;trik|ing an innovation was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And it would be of great nece&s;&s;ity that &s;uch a decree &s;hould be pro|mulgated and recorded, as a &s;tanding rule or canon, to be ob&s;erved by all the churches. But nothing like this appears in any writings, &s;acred or profane. We may therefore retort the argument upon our adver&s;aries thus: &s;ince infants had always been received as church mem|bers, by the initiating rite, they who refu&s;e &s;till to re|ceive them, ought to be able to produce plain orders or
<PB N="59" REF="022944_0060_0FBAC616DF3BF0F0">
precedents for this their refu&s;al: which &s;ince they can|not do, we conclude that the right of church member|&s;hip &s;till belongs to them, and that they are &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>There was not that occa&s;ion for an expre&s;s mention of the bapti&s;m of infants, as of women; for as women had hitherto been admitted to the privileges of church mem|ber&s;hip, without being circumci&s;ed, it might well be doubted, whether bapti&s;m, the &s;acrament of admi&s;&s;ion into the go&s;pel church, was to be admini&s;tered to fe|males. To remove this &s;cruple, we have expre&s;s prece|dents of female bapti&s;m; &s;hewing that per&s;ons of ei|ther &s;ex are alike proper &s;ubjects of this ordinance. But there was no room to doubt, whether the token of church member&s;hip were to be applied to infants; nor had it ever been called in que&s;tion.&mdash;And yet the New Te&s;tament furni&s;hes clear proofs that they are members of the go&s;pel church; and expre&s;s precedents of hou&s;e|hold bapti&s;m, without exception of infants; as has been &s;hewn; nor is there any thing of weight to be urged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>If, after all that has been &s;aid, the want of more ex|pre&s;s orders or precedents for infant bapti&s;m &s;tick as a &s;cruple in the minds of any, let the following con&s;idera|tions be added to what has been &s;aid. 1. Is it not as &s;trange, and more &s;o, that we have but one expre&s;s ex|ample of infant circumci&s;ion, in all the Old Te&s;tament, and not one among the I&s;raelites? And yet, no doubt, it was practi&s;ed every day. Is it not &s;trange, that there is neither expre&s;s precept nor example, in the New Te&s;|tament of women's coming to the Lord's &s;upper? And yet, no doubt, they did &s;o commonly. Je&s;us, it &s;eems, baptized more di&s;ciples than John, John iv. 1. Is it not &s;trange that none of the writers of the New Te&s;tament, except John, give the lea&s;t hint that he baptized at all, though John's baptizing is often mentioned by almo&s;t all of them? The&s;e in&s;tances may &s;hew, how little &s;uch a negative argument is to be depended on in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. 2. Is it not a manife&s;t &s;ign of prejudice, and an unfair mind, to think there is no &s;ufficient war|rant

for infant bapti&s;m, unle&s;s there be expre&s;s orders or precedents for it; and yet refu&s;e to receive infants into the church, though there be neither precept nor prece|dent to warrant or ju&s;tify our refu&s;ing them that privi|lege, with which they were inve&s;ted by God, and held it without di&s;pute thou&s;ands of years? Is not this to &s;train at a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at, and &s;wallow a camel? 3. Does it be|come us to di&s;regard, and refu&s;e to admit &s;uch evidence as mu&s;t be acknowledged to be of weight, and &s;tand ca|villing, that the ca&s;e might have been made plainer? I grant it might, if God had plea&s;ed. And &s;o might many other truths, which yet we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to be|lieve. Our opponents mu&s;t own, that if infant bap|ti&s;m be contrary to the mind of Chri&s;t, this would have been much plainer, had there been an expre&s;s order again&s;t it; and much di&s;pute and trouble would have been prevented. The ca&s;e is left ju&s;t as plain as Chri&s;t has thought fit it &s;hould be. And it belongs not to us to object, that the evidence is not &s;uch as we &s;hould like be&s;t; but to inquire &s;eriou&s;ly, humbly, and prayerfully, what is truth; and thankfully to clo&s;e with it, upon any good evidence of it that we can find. 4. Let me a&s;k the objector, What he would have? What proof would &s;atisfy him? Would it give &s;atisfaction, if the or|der had run thus: <Q>Go teach all nations, baptizing them, and their children?</Q> You could as ea&s;ily and fairly evade this, as you do the expre&s;s proofs we bring of infant church member&s;hip. Chri&s;t &s;ays expre&s;sly, that the kingdom of heaven is, or con&s;i&s;ts of little children; and it is not denied, that the kingdom of heaven is the church; yet we are told, that the&s;e little children, which are of the church, are not infants, but adults, re&s;embling little children in humility. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays expre&s;sly, that the children of believers are Holy. A character never once given in &s;cripture to any but church members: yet this avails nothing. A new &s;en&s;e, unknown in the &s;criptures, is invented, and put upon the word, though it makes non&s;en&s;e of the text. We bring expre&s;s &s;cripture to prove, that the promi&s;e is to the children, as well as the parents; that believers are
<PB N="61" REF="022944_0062_0FBAC61A6C0D2D08">
accounted the children and heirs of Abraham, accord|ing to the promi&s;e; and that his ble&s;&s;ing is come upon the Gentiles: and the right of church member&s;hip for his natural po&s;terity, was certainly one article of this ble&s;&s;ing. Yet our opponents go on again&s;t all this evi|dence, upon no better foundation than their own arbi|trary conjectures and hypothe&s;is. While men are in this humour, what confidence can we have, that, if there had been an expre&s;s order for infant bapti&s;m, they would not &s;et their inventions to work to explain it away? And we might be told, that the children to be baptized are &s;uch as are capable of profe&s;&s;ing faith; or that they are &s;uch as re&s;emble infants in humility; or that they are &s;piritual children, who imitate the faith of the fir&s;t con|verts; or that they are to be baptized after they have been fir&s;t taught, and have given evidence of their effec|tual calling, &amp;c. In &s;hort, a fair and hone&s;t mind will embrace the truth upon any &s;ufficient proof, whether direct or con&s;equential. But when the integrity of the mind is corrupted and di&s;torted, by prejudices, and fondne&s;s for particular &s;chemes, the light that is in men becomes darkne&s;s; and ways will be found to ward off conviction, for the mo&s;t part, by any arguments what|ever. I have con&s;idered this objection the more largely, becau&s;e, though it has really no weight in it, yet it is apt enough to amu&s;e and puzzle weak and &s;imple minds, and to breed &s;cruples, which &s;ometimes prove very trou|ble&s;ome and hurtful.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome, <Q>That it is not being in the co|venant, or church, that gives a right to bapti&s;m; but a divine order to that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e is this &s;aid, except to rai&s;e a du&s;t, and keep up a fruitle&s;s altercation? You acknow|ledge that it is according to the order and rule of the go&s;pel, that all tho&s;e be received as the &s;ubjects of bap|ti&s;m, who have vi&s;ibly an intere&s;t in the covenant and ap|pear to be &s;uch as are to be received into the go&s;pel church. Whether, therefore, their being vi&s;ibly in co|venant or of the church gives them the right to bap|ti&s;m or not; yet, by your own acknowledgment it
<PB N="62" REF="022944_0063_0FBAC61D972B80D8">
proves, or evidences an unque&s;tionable right thereto. The allegation in the objection is, indeed, mo&s;t unrea|&s;onable: but if we &s;hould admit it, for argument &s;ake, the right of church member&s;hip of infants being proved, their right to bapti&s;m is undeniable, as long as it is al|lowed that all &s;uch are the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Another principal objection is, that <Q>according to the go&s;pel order, faith and repentance, or at lea&s;t a credible profe&s;&s;ion thereof, are required of all previ|ou&s;ly or in order to their being baptized. The Apo|&s;tles were fir&s;t to teach tho&s;e whom they baptized, Matt. xxviii. 19. Chri&s;t puts believing before bap|ti&s;m, when he &s;ays, He that believeth, and is bap|tized, &s;hall be &s;aved," Mark xvi. 16. And Peter &s;ays to the Jews, who being pricked in their hearts, a&s;ked, what they &s;hould do; "Repent and be bap|tized," Acts ii. 38. And when the eunuch moved, that he might be baptized, Philip &s;aid to him, "If thou believe&s;t with all thy heart, thou maye&s;t," Acts viii. 37. We read al&s;o of &s;everal, who, agreeably to this rule, were baptized, profe&s;&s;ing their faith and re|pentance. If repentance and faith are the nece&s;&s;ary conditions of bapti&s;m, infants cannot be admitted: for they make no profe&s;&s;ion, and give no evidence of the&s;e qualifications.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. To &s;hew that this objection is without any weight, we need only open our Bibles, and read the &s;e|veral texts that are brought to &s;upport it. Let us take them in their order.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is Matt. xxviii. 19. I have before ob&s;erved, that the proper &s;ignification of the Greek is, <Q>Go make all nations di&s;ciples (or pro&s;elytes) baptizing them&mdash; teaching them,</Q> &amp;c. as our opponents grant: and this is a good warrant for the bapti&s;m of infants, as well as the parents; and they are therefore to be admitted by the &s;ame outward rite. And to &s;ay that infants can no otherwi&s;e become di&s;ciples than by being taught, is no better than a mean begging of the very point to be proved. Whenever the Apo&s;tles made a di&s;ciple of the parent, the right and privilege of di&s;ciples was given to
<PB N="63" REF="022944_0064_0FBAC61EF0553AE0">
the children; who were as &s;uch to be baptized, together with the parents, according to the Apo&s;tles' orders, to di&s;ciple and baptize all nations.</P>
<P>And if we &s;hould under&s;tand the word here u&s;ed as &s;ignifying to in&s;truct or indoctrinate, there would be no rea&s;on for any one to conclude, that infants may not be baptized till they are fir&s;t taught.&mdash;No &s;uch thing is &s;aid, or in the lea&s;t implied. Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples are in|deed to be taught, as well as baptized; children as well as adults; as far, and as &s;oon as they are capable of it. But that they may not be baptized till after they have been fir&s;t taught, there is not one word, not iota in the whole paragraph. And to argue from the bare order of the words, that indoctrination is a nece&s;&s;ary pre-requi|&s;ite to bapti&s;m in all ca&s;es, is to build upon quick-&s;and indeed. For it is well known, that things are often mentioned in &s;cripture, in a promi&s;cuous or inverted or|der.&mdash;Nay, if the order of the words were any &s;olid foundation to argue upon, we might, in this way, prove that it was the will of Chri&s;t, that the Apo&s;tles &s;hould make di&s;ciples, by fir&s;t baptizing them, and then teach|ing them. For the in&s;tructions Chri&s;t gave them when he &s;ent them forth, &s;tand in this order; <Q>Go di&s;ciple all nations, baptizing them&mdash;teaching them,</Q> &amp;c. But we lay no &s;tre&s;s at all upon &s;uch precarious argu|ments. The truth is, &s;ome are to be taught before, and in order to their being baptized. Others are by bap|ti&s;m to be introduced into the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, and put under the di&s;cipline of the church before, and in order to their being taught. Adults we grant, are to be fir&s;t taught, and to make a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, in order to their being baptized; and that for two rea&s;ons. 1. They are immediately capable of it. 2. They have no vi&s;ible right or meetne&s;s to be received as members of the church of Chri&s;t, till they profe&s;s their faith in him. And we may add, that it is not the will of Chri&s;t that any &s;uch &s;hould be taken into his &s;chool, without their free con&s;ent. On the contrary, there are two rea&s;ons why infants &s;hould by bapti&s;m be received into the church, without their being fir&s;t taught, and profe&s;&s;ing
<PB N="64" REF="022944_0065_0FBAC6206EDAE368">
their faith. 1. They are not at pre&s;ent capable of it. 2. Their church member&s;hip and right to bapti&s;m is manife&s;t without it from the &s;criptures; as has been &s;hewn. And it is the will of Chri&s;t, that they be en|tered into his &s;chool immediately, previous to their ac|tual con&s;ent. A profe&s;&s;ion of faith, does not more evi|dence the right of a believer to bapti&s;m, than his infant child's right to the &s;ame is evidenced by the &s;criptures, which declare that, <Q>of &s;uch is the kingdom of hea|ven, that the promi&s;e is to them, and that they are holy.</Q></P>
<P>This text then contains nothing again&s;t infant bap|ti&s;m, and I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn, that it furni&s;hes a good argument in favour of it. The next pa&s;&s;age we have to con&s;ider is Mark xvi. 15, 16, <Q>Preach the go&s;|pel to every creature. He that believeth and is bap|tized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</Q> If this text does not contain &s;o much in favour of infant bapti&s;m as the other, yet certainly there is nothing again&s;t it. It is true faith and bapti&s;m are here required in order to &s;alvation. But whether in order to &s;alvation, faith be required before bapti&s;m in all ca&s;es, or in any ca&s;e, is not &s;aid; nor can it be proved from this text; which only contains a promi&s;e of &s;alva|tion to tho&s;e who believe and are baptized. And I pre|&s;ume it will be allowed, that if any one &s;hould fir&s;t be baptized, and afterwards &s;hould believe; this promi&s;e would belong to him, as really as if he had fir&s;t believed, and then was baptized.&mdash;If any one &s;hould be baptized upon a hypocritical profe&s;&s;ion of faith, and afterwards &s;hould become a true believer, he would no doubt be &s;aved; nor would it be required of him that he be again baptized. And though we grant that a profe&s;&s;ion of faith is required of an unbaptized adult, in order to his being baptized; yet it is an abu&s;e of &s;cripture, to ar|gue that infants are not to be baptized till they believe, becau&s;e believing is mentioned before bapti&s;m in this place, which, by the acknowledgment of our opponents, "Speaks only of tho&s;e who are capable of attending to the preaching of the go&s;pel, and of actual believing."
<PB N="65" REF="022944_0066_0FBAC6256AE389B8">
They do not apply to infants the damnatory &s;entence again&s;t unbelievers; and it is equally unrea&s;onable, to urge their want of faith, as an objection to their being admitted to bapti&s;m.&mdash;In &s;hort, I can find nothing in the&s;e words, that makes the lea&s;t difficulty in the mat|ter; unle&s;s we will be &s;o ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd as to ima|gine, that infants and adult believers cannot both be the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m; or that the mention of the one alone, implies the denial of the other.</P>
<P>In Acts ii. 38, Peter exhorts his hearers to repent and be baptized for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Tho&s;e whom he thus exhorts were all adults. For no one preaches to young infants. It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable in the&s;e words that they were only required to repent in order to be baptiz|ed; which is contrary to the opinion of tho&s;e who re|nounce infant bapti&s;m. They &s;ay we mu&s;t believe as well as repent. We grant that repentance is required of unbaptized adults, in order to their being baptized. But does he &s;o much as hint, that infants are not to be admitted? No. But in the next words a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;ame promi&s;e which belonged to them, and which he holds up as a warrant and encouragement to them, to repent and be baptized, did al&s;o belong to their chil|dren. But the&s;e words have been before con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark is to be made on the words of Phi|lip to the Eunuch, <Q>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t be baptized.</Q> Any Pedobapti&s;t, mu&s;t, upon his own principles, have &s;aid the &s;ame, upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The examples of tho&s;e who were baptized upon a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, are &s;ometimes brought as an objection again&s;t infant bapti&s;m. The&s;e, we grant, are a proof that believers are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. We grant further, that they are no proof that infants are &s;ubjects. But it is &s;trange it &s;hould ever be thought that the&s;e ex|amples make any thing again&s;t the bapti&s;m of infants. Cannot adult believers be admitted, unle&s;s infants be re|jected? Is there not room enough in the church for both? A thou&s;and in&s;tances of one &s;ort, are no argu|ment again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of the other. The truth is,
<PB N="66" REF="022944_0067_0FBAC6272DCF62F0">
we have not many certain in&s;tances of adult bapti&s;m mentioned particularly in the New Te&s;tament. Several of the&s;e were per&s;ons of note, who had no children. Of others, it appears, that if there were children in their families, as is highly probable, they were baptized with them. And &s;ome that are confidently &s;uppo&s;ed to have been adults, might a great part of them have been in|fants, for any thing that appears to the contrary; parti|cularly the three thou&s;and added to the church on the day of Penteco&s;t. But among all tho&s;e, who are &s;aid to have been baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, it is remarkable that we find not one that was born of Chri|&s;tian parents, or was, on our principles, a fit &s;ubject of bapti&s;m in infancy. We have, in the New Te&s;tament, the hi&s;tory of the church for thirty years after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, in all which there is not one in&s;tance that in the lea&s;t countenances their practice, who are again&s;t the bapti&s;m of the children of believers, till they are of age to profe&s;s their faith. Wherein they differ from us, they have mo&s;t certainly neither precept nor example in &s;cripture to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this objection, which has often been held up with &s;o much parade, is like a vapour; which, beheld at a di&s;tance, may look as if there might be &s;ome|thing in it; but upon a nearer view, is found to be as light and un&s;ub&s;tantial as the air, while we endeavour to handle it, we can find nothing in it.</P>
<P>It is objected by &s;ome, that <Q>Chri&s;t was baptized in adult age; and we ought herein to follow his ex|ample.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. John's bapti&s;m, with which Chri&s;t was bap|tized, was not in&s;tituted till Chri&s;t was of adult age. How could it be expected that he &s;hould have the ordi|nance admini&s;tered to him, before it was a divine ordi|nance? We might as well argue again&s;t infant circum|ci&s;ion, becau&s;e Abraham was circumci&s;ed in adult age. But Chri&s;t in his infancy was dedicated to God, and re|ceived into the number of his people, according to the ordinances then in u&s;e: which may &s;erve as a precedent and pattern to chri&s;tians to dedicate their children to
<PB N="67" REF="022944_0068_0FBAC62B01E26430">
God in bapti&s;m, the rite of induction to the Chri&s;tian Church. Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was the token of his &s;olemn con&s;ecration to his public mini&s;try; &s;ignifying his anoint|ing with the Holy Gho&s;t to the offices of prophet, prie&s;t, and king (and e&s;pecially as the high prie&s;t of his church) which he was to execute, and was accord|ingly inaugurated at his entering on the public di&s;charge of the&s;e his offices, when he was about thirty years of age. There were many peculiar circum&s;tances attend|ing Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, which are not imitable by us.</P>
<P>As many people have mi&s;taken the nature and end of Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, and have therefore thought it their du|ty to follow him by being baptized in adult age. For their &s;ake, I &s;hall al&s;o make the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. The bapti&s;m with which Chri&s;t was baptized was not the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, as it plainly appears from Acts xix. 3, 4, 5. There we find the Apo&s;tles baptiz|ed &s;ome per&s;ons over again, who had been before baptiz|ed by John; which they never would have done, if John's bapti&s;m had been that of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;a|tion.</P>
<P N="2">2. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, when Chri&s;t was baptized, he was ju&s;t then about to enter into his prie&s;tly and mini&s;te|rial office, as the great high prie&s;t of his church; and as &s;uch he was typified by Aaron and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Now God had po&s;itively commanded that Aaron &s;hould be admitted into his office by wa&s;hing or bapti&s;m, &s;ee Exod. xxix 4. &amp;c. We al&s;o find that this was accord|ingly done, &s;ee Levit. vii. 6. Therefore when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was about to take this office upon him, he went to John to be baptized; and though John was &s;en|&s;ible that he had more need to be baptized of Chri&s;t, and therefore &s;eemed to draw back from the duty; yet Chri&s;t &s;aid (in allu&s;ion, no doubt, to the command for initiating the high prie&s;t by wa&s;hing or bapti&s;m) <Q>Suf|fer it to be &s;o now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> all that was typical of me as the high prie&s;t of the church. And "then he &s;uffered him," Matt. iii. 13, 14, 15. It is al&s;o very remarkable that Je&s;us Chri&s;t at that time, was about thirty years of age,
<PB N="68" REF="022944_0069_0FBAC62D39439778">
under which the prie&s;ts were not to enter on their office. Compare Levit. iv. 3 and Matt. iii. 23.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That infant bapti&s;m is a part of popery, the ba&s;is of national churches, and worldly e&s;tabli&s;hments; that it unites the church and world, and keeps them together.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. Infant bapti&s;m is grounded on the &s;crip|tures; and is commonly practi&s;ed in tho&s;e churches that are not, nor ever were &s;ubject to the Pope; therefore, it is not a part of Popery though practi&s;ed, as divers other ordinances are, in the Roman church.</P>
<P>Infant bapti&s;m is not the ba&s;is of national churches, and worldly e&s;tabli&s;hments. Infants were church mem|bers long before there was a national church in the world; which was not till the Horeb covenant. That particular con&s;titution of a church, and form of admini|&s;tration, whereby it becomes national, has no connection with, or dependance upon infant bapti&s;m. A national church may as well be formed upon the principle of An|tipedobapti&s;m as any other. If the church of England &s;hould renounce infant bapti&s;m, and yet retain its pre|&s;ent con&s;titution in other re&s;pects, it would &s;till be, and might as well continue, a national church as ever. There may be a national church, though not one half of the nation are of it. And there would be no national church, though all the individuals of the nation were members of congregational churches. And as for worldly e&s;ta|bli&s;hments of religion, it is too plain to need in&s;i&s;ting on, that infant bapti&s;m no way affects them. Infant bap|ti&s;m &s;tands as well without, as with human e&s;tabli&s;h|ments; and human e&s;tabli&s;hments can &s;tand as well with|out, as with infant bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Infant bapti&s;m does not unite the church and the world, and keep them together. If by the world we mean tho&s;e that are not of the vi&s;ible church; how can the baptizing the infants of church members unite the church with tho&s;e that do not belong to it? If by the world be meant profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, who are manife&s;tly unmeet and unworthy of chri&s;tian communion, infant bapti&s;m neither u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tes the church, nor keeps it united
<PB N="69" REF="022944_0070_0FBAC62EE8B7A138">
with any &s;uch. It is owing to the neglect or abu&s;e of di&s;cipline, when &s;uch remain united with the church. Or if any &s;hould mean by the world, vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians, who are &s;ecretly hypocritical; it is not the will of Chri&s;t that the church &s;hould be &s;eparated from the&s;e, till their hypocri&s;y becomes manife&s;t. Nor would the aboli&s;hing of infant bapti&s;m make &s;uch a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>It is objected, <Q>That the an&s;wer of a good con&s;ci|ence is required in bapti&s;m, in order to its being of &s;aving advantage, 1 Pet. iii. 21. And as infants are incapable of this, they are not &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m.</Q> I an&s;wer, Though the an&s;wer or engagement of a good con&s;cience mu&s;t be joined with the outward wa&s;hing with water, when the &s;ubject is capable of it, yet this makes nothing again&s;t infant bapti&s;m. For if the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience be afterwards annexed to the &s;acra|mental wa&s;hing received in infancy, &s;uch a bapti&s;m is as valid, and as available to &s;alvation, as if the wa&s;hing with water, and the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience, had been at the &s;ame time. And infants are by their bap|ti&s;m bound to the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience; which they are to recognize and perform, when they are capa|ble of it. Indeed this pa&s;&s;age &s;peaks plainly in our fa|vour. For the Apo&s;tle compares bapti&s;m to the ark of Noah, as being the figure or antitype of it, bearing a re&s;emblance to it. Noah by faith prepared the ark, for the &s;aving of him&s;elf and his hou&s;e. As his children were received with him into the ark, &s;o the children of believers have a right to the church, and are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, together with their parents; which bears in this re&s;pect, the figure and re&s;emblance of the ark.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o objected, that, <Q>if infants are to be mem|bers of the church, and &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, they ought al&s;o to be admitted to partake of the Lord's &s;upper, which is an ordinance to which all the mem|bers of the Chri&s;tian church have a right. And ac|cordingly it was cu&s;tomary with the ancient chri&s;tians, who practi&s;ed infant bapti&s;m, to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper al&s;o to them. And they who di&s;approve the

communicating of infants, &s;hould, if they would be con&s;i&s;tent, di&s;allow the baptizing of them.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. We grant that infants, as church members, have an external right to all the ordinances of the vi&s;ible church, as far, and &s;oon as they are actually capable of, and meet for them. As they are immediately capable and meet &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, they are to be admitted thereto without delay. As &s;oon as they are capable of receiving in&s;truction from the word, they &s;hould be brought to give their attendance to it; and when they can &s;o far under&s;tand the nature and de&s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper, and have &s;uch a mea&s;ure of knowledge and faith, that they can di&s;cern the Lord's body, and examine them&s;elves, and &s;o eat of that bread, and drink of that cup; it is not only their right, but their duty, to do &s;o, without delay. Though an infant may have a right to an e&s;tate, of which he is an heir, yet he is not admitted to po&s;&s;e&s;s, occupy, and improve it, till he is of capacity for it. And &s;uch is the nature and de&s;ign of the Lord's &s;upper, that a right attendance on it, requires an actu|al capacity and pre&s;ent meetne&s;s for it; which infants have not. And it is this want of capacity and meetne&s;s, and not a want of right to church privileges, that is the rea&s;on why we do not admit them. But this rea&s;on does not exclude them from bapti&s;m; of which they are as capable and meet &s;ubjects now, as they were of circum|ci&s;ion formerly. They are capable of the &s;ign, and the thing &s;ignified; of coming under the obligations, and having the grace and privileges of the covenant &s;ecured and conveyed to them; of being &s;olemnly dedicated to God; recognized and admitted, as his vi&s;ible church and people. The&s;e things they are capable of in infancy. And to &s;ignify and effect the&s;e, is the de&s;ign and u&s;e of bapti&s;m, as has been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It appears, I tru&s;t, that our opponents have no rea&s;on to &s;ay, as they are wont to do with great confidence, that there is nothing in the &s;criptures in favour of in|fant bapti&s;m, but they plainly declare again&s;t it. We have &s;earched the &s;criptures, and find nothing at all con|trary to infant bapti&s;m; and plain proofs that infants are
<PB N="71" REF="022944_0072_0FBAC6326EA2F700">
the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. Whether this does not amount to a fair and full proof, let every one who has the rea&s;on of a man con&s;ider and judge.</P>
<P>We learn al&s;o, the error of rebaptizing tho&s;e, who have been baptized in their infancy. This practice can|not be ju&s;tified either by precept or example, or any good rea&s;ons. Infant bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by &s;prinkling, we have examined by the &s;criptures, and find it to be well warranted. To renounce it therefore, and be baptized over again, is utterly wrong. And though we charita|bly believe that tho&s;e who have gone into this practice, have done it con&s;cientiou&s;ly, yet their con&s;ciences were therein mi&s;guided, and they have entangled them&s;elves by the wrong &s;tep they have taken, and given Satan an advantage again&s;t them. Having openly renounced communion with all chri&s;tians, but tho&s;e of their own party, they too often appear to be exceedingly hardened again&s;t all means that can be u&s;ed for convincing them of their error; and take it with great &s;corn and impati|ence, to have it &s;ugge&s;ted to them that perhaps they are in a mi&s;take. And if any &s;uch &s;u&s;picions &s;hould ever ari&s;e in their minds, yet what a &s;trong temptation will they have to wink hard again&s;t the light, when it begins to enter into their minds, and to di&s;cover to them, what they cannot bear the thoughts of, that in the height of their confidence they have been wrong. It is very un|happy when chri&s;tians run them&s;elves into &s;uch &s;ad entan|glements, and get their &s;cruples and prejudices fixed and rivetted.</P>
