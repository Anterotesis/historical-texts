<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from <HI>CHARLES READ,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the Hon. <HI>JOHN LADD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his A&s;&s;ociates, Ju&s;tices of the Peace for the County of <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME Per&s;ons, of good Character, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> having applied to his Excellency the Governor, for his Licence for &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> who have been always in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, to re&s;ide in your Town, he has been plea&s;ed to grant his Licence, and the Protection of this Government, by his Order of this Day, directed to all Officers civil and military.</P>
<P>The late Outrage committed in <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter,</HI> is &s;uch a notorious Violation of the Rights of Government, and a Crime of &s;o black a Dye, that I have not the lea&s;t Doubt but that the Perpetrators of it will, in good time, &s;uffer the Puni&s;h|ment the Law inflicts upon Murderers; for altho' their Con&s;ciences may be har|dened, or they at pre&s;ent in a State of Infatuation, yet the Time mu&s;t come when the&s;e Heats will &s;ub&s;ide, and Mat|ters
<PB N="3" REF="009809_0003_0F7A552C001A8128">&s;tand on a right Footing, then the&s;e Tran&s;actions mu&s;t be enquired into; and would any Man in his Sen&s;es have &s;uch a Cloud hanging over him and his E|&s;tate, which would, by his own Ra&s;h|ne&s;s, be &s;ubjected to large Demands and Forfeitures to the Crown?</P>
<P>To have fallen on a Town of the E|nemy <HI>Indians,</HI> and to have de&s;troyed them and it, might have terrified the <HI>Indians,</HI> and le&s;&s;ened the Number of our Enemies; but &s;uch an inhuman Murder as that at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> can only &s;erve to convince the World, that there are among us Per&s;ons more &s;avage than <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves. To be cruel in War, and while the Blood is in a high Ferment, is frequent; but to a&s;&s;emble at a Di&s;tance, to march many Miles with Intent, in cool Blood, to butcher defencele&s;s People, who were placed where the Magi&s;tracy plea&s;ed to order them, was an amazing Depravation of every Sen&s;e of Virtue and Humanity.</P>
<P>Would Wars ever have an End, if every Per&s;on who had lo&s;t a Relative in it &s;hould exerci&s;e his own Judgment, and take away the Life of any Indivi|dual
<PB N="4" REF="009809_0004_0F7A552D4BDEE120">of the Nation they had been at War with, whenever (after a Peace) he &s;hould have Strength &s;o to do?</P>
<P>Weak Minds are apt to be in an ex|traordinary Manner inflamed, and get into violent Ferments, on reading an Article in the Gazette of a few Per|&s;ons being de&s;troyed by <HI>Indians;</HI> and yet the&s;e very Per&s;ons will with little or no Emotion, run over an Article of a Battle between two Armies, where Thou&s;ands fell on a Side. They get heated by the Mode of War, though it is of little Con&s;equence whether the Scalp or Finger of a dead Corp&s;e is tak|en off as a token of Victory, or how many Wounds it has. As a free Peo|ple, <HI>Indians</HI> have the &s;ame Right to go to War, as any other Nation. When they become Subjects, they have the &s;ame Right of living on Lands of their own, or of other People's, by the Owner's Permi&s;&s;ion. If they remove from one Place to another, the Over&s;eers of the Poor may demand the u&s;ual Security, and the Magi&s;trates deal with them as with others, for Mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>I know of no Law to oblige them to
<PB N="5" REF="009809_0005_0F7A552DF4A2AF88">remove from one Place to another; while they comply with the Laws in Force, their Treatment ought to be the &s;ame with other Subjects in like Circum&s;tan|ces; their Per&s;ons and Effects equally claim the Protection of the Laws; and to murder or a&s;&s;ault one of them, is a Crime equal to the doing of the &s;ame to another of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects, the Colour of the Skin can make no e&s;&s;enti|al Difference; to have a yellow one in the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, may be a Misfortune, but not a Crime. I con|fe&s;s the <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre has rai&s;ed in me a very high Re&s;entment; and what|ever the <HI>Indians</HI> may have done trea|chero&s;ly, I really think this Act, and the de&s;troying in cool Blood three <HI>Indi|an</HI> Guides, who undertook to pilot the <HI>Paxton</HI> Voluntiers (who were &s;tarving when they met with them) to <HI>Fort-Augu&s;|ta,</HI> and by who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance the whole Par|ty were undoubtedly &s;aved from peri&s;h|ing by Famine; to de&s;troy the&s;e Per&s;ons, who, at their Intreaty, had done them &s;uch eminent Service, and &s;aved their Lives, equals any thing we have met with; nor can any Per&s;on &s;how that <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="009809_0006_0F7A552EC126E818">have ever done wor&s;e; if they have, it has never come to my Know|ledge. Per&s;ons who thir&s;t after the Blood of <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;hould go to the Seat of War to &s;hew their Courage. If there were no Crime in it, nothing that would &s;ubject them to Puni&s;hment, no For|feiture of E&s;tate, yet there is &s;omething &s;o very mean in attempting the Lives of a wretched People who have voluntarily thrown them&s;elves into your Power, that no Man of real Courage or Bravery would bear the Thought of doing it. Many of the <HI>Indians</HI> have been very u&s;e|ful to us, and &s;till may be &s;o. The Nations far back, and who&s;e Intercour&s;e have been chiefly, if not totally with the <HI>French,</HI> have been by them per&s;waded to enter into a War; and is this to be wondered at, that they &s;hould believe the People they had long traded with, and been long allied to? We &s;hould ra|ther admire their Con&s;tancy to their old Friends; and have we not Rea&s;on from thence to conclude, that when they know us, and a Peace is firmly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed between us and them, they will be as firm and con&s;tant in their Friend&s;hip
<PB N="7" REF="009809_0007_0F7A552FA3761060">to us as they have been to the <HI>French.</HI> To con&s;ider them in a true Light, we &s;hould recollect, that on this Continent their Numbers are very great; that eve|ry Individual will purcha&s;e &s;ome Arti|cle of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture; that it is Trade only that enables <HI>Britain</HI> to main|tain Armies, and &s;end forth Fleets, which terrify the World, and rai&s;es the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Name in the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the Univer&s;e; and the <HI>Indians</HI> will (as &s;oon as they are undeceived, and Peace is e&s;tabli&s;hed with them) make us Ma&s;ters of the mo&s;t valuable Trade for Furs and Peltry in the World, and there|by contribute to the Riches and Glory of the Nation.</P>
<P>There are People &s;o &s;anguine that, without con&s;idering, would wi&s;h the whole Race of <HI>Indians</HI> extinct, but they &s;hew their Ignorance of the real Inter|e&s;t of the Nation; they would have us &s;et about de&s;troying them Root and Branch&mdash;It needs but little Reflection to convince them, that while &s;uch im|men&s;e Tracts of Land lie to the We&s;t|ward, &s;uch Attempt is vain, nor would all the Forces that have la&s;t War
<PB N="8" REF="009809_0008_0F7A55305306E920">taken the Field in <HI>Europe</HI> effect it. I &s;hould join heartily with the mo&s;t forward to make the be&s;t In|cur&s;ions we could into their Country, but to com|mit no more Slaughter there, than to bring them to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Mi&s;conduct, and make them, for the future, dread our Re&s;entment, and learn to know that it was their real Intere&s;t to behave friendly to us, and cultivate our Regard for them. Things will, I think, clearly appear in this Light to any Per&s;on who will coolly and deliberately con&s;ider the Matter devoid of Pa&s;&s;ion or of Prejudice.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be many now in your Country, who have heard their Ance&s;tors recount the Kindne&s;s with which the <HI>Indians</HI> treated them when it was in their Power to have de&s;troyed the whole Number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlers in a Day. They then fed them, and gave them all Kind of friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance; I hope their De&s;cendants will now let Humanity, let Chri&s;tianity prevail over them to return the Kindne&s;s, and not &s;ay to the Charge of the&s;e poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People the Actions of the remote Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom they are as much Strangers as we are. When the Treachery of the <HI>Indians</HI> is repre&s;ented, Circum&s;tan|ces bad in them&s;elves may be exaggerated (tho' I have no Doubt but too much is true) I beg you will guard your Neighbours again&s;t taking up Tales they may hear of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> which, when enquired into, may be found without any Foundation; if they mi&s;behave, the Mgi&s;trates can puni&s;h them; therefore I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any will be &s;o impru|dent, by any Conduct of their own, to involve the Government into Difficulty, and them&s;elves in in|vietable Ruin.</P>
