<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publick &s;hould never have been trou|bled with the following Treati&s;e on the Lawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War, had it not been for a late un&s;ea&s;onable Pamphlet, in|tituled, <HI>The Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, as held by the People called Quakers, vindicated,</HI> in An&s;wer to <HI>Gil|bert Tennent</HI>'s Sermon on the Lawfulne&s;s of War. This Divine having, at the Reque&s;t of &s;ome Gen|tlemen engaged in the A&s;&s;ociation for Defence lately enter'd into for &s;ecuring the Province again&s;t a threatening Inva&s;ion, printed a Sermon which he had preached upon the Lawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War, this Pamphlet was printed and publi&s;hed in An&s;wer to it: And that it might have the more univer&s;al In|fluence over the Province, was order'd to be given away <HI>gratis.</HI> In this Performance the Author has undertaken to prove, by fair and candid Interpreta|tions of Scripture (as he tells us in the third Page) the very Rever&s;e of what the Sermon had proved. How well he hath &s;ucceeded, the Reader will &s;ee in the Peru&s;al of the &s;econd Part of this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was undoubtedly undertaken with no other Intent but to defeat this generous Undertaking of tho&s;e worthy Men (who could not po&s;&s;ibly have any
<PB N="iv" REF="006120_0003_1027D930664EF9F0">other View in it but the general Good) by rai&s;ing Scru|ples in Peoples Minds about the Lawfulne&s;s of what they were about to engage in. This was done at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a Time, when every Body (but the Au|thor and his Friends) was fully convinced, that there was an extraordinary Call for falling upon &s;ome Mea|&s;ures for our Security, that it gave no &s;mall Alarm to every Wellwi&s;her to his Country; in&s;omuch that ma|ny did not &s;tick to &s;ay, it looked more like the Performance of One who was engaged in a foreign Intere&s;t, than of a true and loyal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, as a Te&s;timony of my Re|gard for the Good of human Society in general, of my Duty to my King and Country in particular, and of true Benevolence for all my Fellow Subjects; I have &s;uffered my&s;elf to be prevailed upon by &s;ome true Patriots, and Lovers of their Country, to in|terpo&s;e in the Behalf of that Doctrine, which, if once given up, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dominions, as well as tho&s;e of all other Chri&s;tian States, would &s;oon be|come a Scene of Slavery and Oppre&s;&s;ion. This I have done in the following Treati&s;e, which I pray God may be an Antidote again&s;t that pernicious and groundle&s;s Principle this Vindicator endeavours to &s;upport.</P>
<P>IN this Work I have clearly proved the Lawful|ne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War under the Old Te&s;tament; and thence I have deduced, as an undeniable Con|&s;equence, that it is therefore not unlawful under the New.</P>
<P>IN Pro&s;ecution of the Argument I have followed this Method: 1. I have &s;tated this Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether in any Ca&s;e it be lawful for Chri&s;tians to make War under the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P N="2">2. I have taken the affirmative Side of the Que|&s;tion; and for the Re&s;olution thereof, I have proved, both from Rea&s;on and Revelation, that Defen&s;ive War was lawful under the Old Te&s;tament. And,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="v" REF="006120_0004_1027EB2F72A1FD88">
3. I HAVE made it appear (which is a plain Re&s;olution) that as there is nothing in Chri&s;tianity that can amount to a Law prohibiting Defen&s;ive War under the Go&s;pel; therefore it cannot be unlawful for Chri&s;tians, under that Di&s;pen&s;ation, to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t a foreign Enemy: All this is contain'd in the fir&s;t Part.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd Part, I have examined all the Pa&s;|&s;ages in the fore&s;aid Pamphlet, that &s;eem to affect the general Doctrine I had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the fir&s;t; which I de&s;ire the Reader may peru&s;e with Atten|tion. But there are two Pa&s;&s;ages e&s;pecially, which, tho' I have in&s;i&s;ted upon pretty largely in the Trea|ti&s;e, yet, for the farther Illu&s;tration of the Doctrines advanced in the Examination of them, I mu&s;t beg Leave to add &s;omething here, in order to prevent Mi&s;takes. The fir&s;t is, where I examine what the <HI>V.</HI> advances again&s;t the Law and Light of Nature. The &s;econd is, where I examine his Ob&s;ervation con|cerning Mens acting in moral Matters according to their Convictions.</P>
<P>THAT there is &s;uch a Thing as the Law of Nature exi&s;ting in the Univer&s;e, I have briefly proved in the &s;econd Part; and that notwith&s;tanding the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> Mankind were capable of di&s;cover|ing the main Principles of the Law of Nature, and the nece&s;&s;ary Duties incumbent upon them by Virtue of this Law. Now, for the farther Illu&s;tration of this curious Point, and preventing Mi&s;takes, let me add,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> WHEN I &s;ay there are natural e&s;&s;ential Differences in the Natures of Things, from whence re&s;ults a Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s in Actions to certain Ends; I don't maintain that the&s;e Differences are any Thing ab&s;tracted from the Will of God, this being a Speculation that has no Relation to my Subject. It is enough for my Purpo&s;e, if it be grant|ed, that there are &s;uch natural and e&s;&s;ential Differen|ces in Things, whether tho&s;e Differences be con&s;i|dered
<PB N="vi" REF="006120_0005_1027EB31ED1BED88">as ari&s;ing from the Things them&s;elves antece|dent to the Will of God, or from his Will con&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ting them &s;uch, tho' before they were in their Na|tures perfectly indifferent.</P>
<P>A DEAL may be &s;aid for both the&s;e Opinions; but I incline to the latter, as being mo&s;t agreeable to holy Scripture.&mdash;And tho' we place the Spring and Fountain of the Law of Nature in the Divine Will, which is free in the mo&s;t unlimited Sen&s;e; it will not follow from hence, that the Law of Nature may therefore be changed by God, or the contrary be commanded; becau&s;e he has created Man (who is the Subject of this Law) a Being not po&s;&s;ibly to be pre&s;erv'd without the Ob&s;ervation of it. Now this being the Ca&s;e, we cannot with any Colour of Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e that God will either alter or rever&s;e the Law of Nature, &s;o long as he brings no Change on human Nature it&s;elf; and &s;o long as the Actions en|join'd by this Law do by a natural Con&s;equence pro|mote the Good of Society, in which is contain'd all the temporal Happine&s;s of Mankind, while the con|trary Actions do by as &s;trong a Nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troy that Society: That is, &s;o long as Beneficence, Kind|ne&s;s, good Faith, Ju&s;tice, Gratitude, and the like Practices, &s;hall have a Power of engaging and winning on Mens Minds, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>AND therefore &s;uppo&s;ing human Nature and human Affairs to be fix'd and con&s;tant, the Law of Nature, tho' it owed its original In&s;titution to the free Plea&s;ure of God, remains firm and immutable.</P>
<P>AND here we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully be|twixt the Law of Nature as it re&s;pects God him&s;elf, who is the Author of it, and as it re&s;pects Men, who are the Subjects thereof. For tho' 'twould be Impiety to a&s;&s;ert that the Law of Nature contains any Thing in it repugnant to the divine Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice; yet we are certain, that God does many Actions, which, were we to do, would be abomina|ble
<PB N="vii" REF="006120_0006_1027EB33901E1940">Wickedne&s;s: And the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e this Law is not common to God and Men. The Law of Nature, tho' it indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliges us yet it can lay no Obligation upon him. So that when we &s;ay God cannot di&s;pen&s;e with the Law of Nature, we mean, that he cannot alter the Relations of Things with Regard to &s;uch Duties as nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the Con&s;titution of human Nature. He cannot alter the Natures of Virtue and Vice, without altering the Con&s;titution of human Nature. Now from this Ob&s;ervation, 'tis ea&s;y to an&s;wer tho&s;e In&s;tances which &s;ome give of God's di&s;pen&s;ing with the Law of Nature; as when he commanded the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to de&s;troy &s;ome Nations utterly, and to &s;poil others of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Here was only an Alteration made in the Properties of Things, but the Obligation of the preceptive Law of Nature was not hereby di&s;|&s;olved. Murder would have been an intrin&s;ical E|vil &s;till; but that which was done by the immediate and &s;pecial Command of God, who is the &s;upream Lord and Di&s;po&s;er of all Things, and hath a fuller Right over his Creatures, than any Man can have over another, would have been no Murder. Robbery would have been Evil &s;till; but taking Things alie|nated from their Properties by God him&s;elf, who is the rightful Proprietor of all Things, was not Robbe|ry. It cannot therefore be properly called a Di&s;|pen&s;ation of the Law of Nature, when a Man by expre&s;s Command from Heaven executes God's Right upon other Men meerly as his In&s;trument. Circum&s;tances may be varied, and the Object changed, and yet the Law it&s;elf &s;uffer no Alteration. Again, when I &s;ay that the general and mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary Precepts of the Law of Nature are di&s;covera|ble by every Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the due Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on, I don't maintain that the&s;e general Princi|ples are innate, or imprinted, as it were, in Mens Minds, from their very Birth, in the Manner of Di|&s;tinct
<PB N="viii" REF="006120_0007_1027EB3640F12278">and actual Propo&s;itions, &s;o as to be readily ex|pre&s;s'd and utter'd by them, as &s;oon as they arrive at the U&s;e of Speech without further In&s;truction or Meditation; becau&s;e this Doctrine to me &s;eems not to have any Foundation in Nature. Tho' I vene|rate the great Names of <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> and <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who are of the contrary Opinion; yet, what I take to be the Truth, I hope I &s;hall always pre&s;er before a blind Obedience to any human Authority. When I &s;ay therefore, that the Law of Nature is the Dic|tate of right Rea&s;on, my Meaning is this, That the human Under&s;tanding is endued with &s;uch a Power, as to be able from the Contemplation of human Na|ture, to di&s;cover a Nece&s;&s;ity of living agreeably to this Law. On which Account St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares it to be written in Mens Hearts, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 15.</P>
<P>AS the Under&s;tanding performs the Office of a Light to direct Men in their Actions, whereby when they are not guided aright, they mu&s;t una|voidably lo&s;e their Way; &s;o it ought to be laid down as a certain Principle, that there ever was, both in the apprehending Faculty, and in the Judg|ment, &s;uch a Degree of natural Rectitude, as, upon due Attention given, will not &s;uffer Men to be de|ceived in Reference to the main Principles and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Duties of moral Practice; and that neither of tho&s;e Powers are &s;o corrupted and depraved, as to put them under a Nece&s;&s;ity of being mi&s;taken there|in. An ill-cut Mirror will pre&s;ent every Image in a di&s;torted Confu&s;ion; and the Tongue, when tinc|tur'd with a Jaundice, is not able to di&s;cern the Diffe|rence of Ta&s;tes: And yet it does not follow, that therefore the Sen&s;es, to which tho&s;e Offices belong, are fallacious and uncertain. Neither could it have been charg'd on tho&s;e who never had the Benefit of a divine Revelation, as Guilt, that they had done a bad Action, if they had not been furni&s;hed with a clear Di&s;cernment of moral Good and Evil. And it
<PB N="ix" REF="006120_0008_1027EB3A922D5DB8">would be the highe&s;t Inju&s;tice to impute that Error as &s;inful, which was beyond Mens Power to avoid or &s;hake off. And therefore, unle&s;s we would ut|terly &s;ubvert all the Morality of Action in Men before the giving of the moral Law, we mu&s;t by all Means maintain, that the human Under&s;tanding ever was, and &s;till is, &s;o far right, as to be able to di&s;cern and practi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Duties of Nature's Law, upon &s;ufficient Enquiry and Meditation. But to prevent Mi&s;takes, I beg Leave particularly to remark, that I am not here debating (as being foreign to the Mat|ter in Hand) what Power the human Under&s;tanding hath about Things which depend upon divine Reve|lation, or what it can perform in &s;uch extraordinary Ca&s;es without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine Grace; but only about the Power it hath as 'tis employ'd in re|gulating Mens Actions according to the Dictates of the Law of Nature. And as to this Point, I have a&s;&s;erted, and I hope with no Offence to any con&s;ide|rate Man, that there never was any Per&s;on of proper Years, and Ma&s;ter of his own Rea&s;on, that could not comprehend the mo&s;t general and nece&s;&s;ary Precepts of the Law of Nature, and tho&s;e which are of the greate&s;t U&s;e in common Life; and di&s;cern the A|greement they bear to the rational and &s;ocial State of Mankind.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t indeed be owned, that Intere&s;t, joined with the Prejudices of Infancy, Education, or Cu|&s;tom, ob&s;cure the cleare&s;t Dictates of Rea&s;on; of this we every Day &s;ee numberle&s;s In&s;tances. Some are &s;o blinded with Self-love, that all their fine Parts &s;eem intirely to for&s;ake them, as &s;oon as any Matter comes in Debate, the Deci&s;ion of which is attended with any Inconvenience to them&s;elves; and yet the&s;e very Per&s;ons &s;hall go through a great many other Things, infinitely more difficult, with the greate&s;t Facility, when they have no Tendency to their own Di&s;advantage. One principal Criterion of right Rea|&s;on,
<PB N="x" REF="006120_0009_1027EB3C1D65D160">and that whereby we know a&s;&s;uredly that it is natural to Men, is, that the unju&s;t Man, when he is acting in any Affair that does nowi&s;e affect his own Intere&s;t, judges exactly according to the Rules of Ju&s;tice; and vicious Per&s;ons, of every Sort, have ju&s;t Sentiments of Things, where they do not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Pa&s;&s;ion. But there is another Cau&s;e of wrong Judgment be&s;ides the&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> Precipitation and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, equally hurtful to Society with the other. A Man oftentimes be|comes tenaciou&s;ly fond of fal&s;e or doubtful Princi|ples, taken up without Examination or Reflection; and then 'tis no Wonder if he finds him&s;elf unable to reconcile the&s;e with the Truth of Things, or to draw from them ju&s;t and regular Con&s;equences. How few do we find, who &s;o much as think of e|ver calling in que&s;tion certain Principles which they have early imbibed, e&s;pecially if they &s;ee them au|thorized by the Opinions of tho&s;e whom they look upon to be their Superiors in Wi&s;dom and Experi|ence; or e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Cu&s;toms of the Society or Place where they have been bred? Hence we find, even Men of Parts, when pu&s;hed on by Party Ani|mo&s;ities, &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavouring to find out, not what is mo&s;t conformable to the invariable Rules of right Rea&s;on and Equity (the very Exi&s;tence of which they have the A&s;&s;urance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eny but only what to them &s;eems mo&s;t proper to ju&s;tify the fana|tica. Notions their Party hath embraced. But tho' &s;ome Per&s;ons, thro' Indolence, may po&s;&s;ibly never have thought of one or two Precepts; or thro' Rathne&s;s and Precipitation, may have fram'd wrong Opinions of acting; or by a Mind corrupted with vicious Habits, may have called their Truth and Nece&s;&s;ity in que&s;tion; or may have embrac'd other Rules of Action contrary to natural Sugge&s;tions; yet this no more proves, that human Nature is univer&s;ally corrupted, than it proves, that, becau&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="006120_0010_1027EB3EE260B860">a Man who has put out his Eyes, cannot di&s;cern any Difference in Colours; therefore others cannot do &s;o, who have not put out their Eyes. For the&s;e univer&s;al Edicts are &s;o clearly publi&s;hed and explain'd, and &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven with our very Being, that no Man, with the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, can be incapable of apprehending and di&s;cerning them; &s;ince to this End nothing more is required, than an ordinary Portion of natural Light, provided that the Mind be not vitiated and ob&s;tructed by &s;ome Di&s;tem|per.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN my Examination of what the <HI>V.</HI> hath ad|vanc'd concerning People's acting in moral Duties according to their Convictions, I ob&s;erved, That to make Men's Faith or Per&s;ua&s;ion the Rule of moral Duties, &s;eems to be a prepo&s;terous Way of arguing, as affecting the great Foundation of Morality, and producing very dangerous, yet nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equen|ces. For the further Illu&s;tration of which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meadd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 'Tis true, Ca&s;ui&s;ts allow, that 'tis a Sin for a Man to act again&s;t his Judgment, even &s;uppo&s;ing his Judg|ment to be fal&s;e: But then they carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between an Error in Theory, and an Error in Prac|tice. A Man errs in the Theory, when he fancies a Thing to be commanded, which is really forbidden, or left indifferent, <HI>i.e.</HI> neither commanded nor forbid|den, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> But he errs in the Practice, when &s;omething intervenes in the Exerci&s;e of Actions, which alters their Circum&s;tances. Now 'tis allow'd that the former Kind of Errors do not hinder their Im|putation to an Agent: becau&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed not to have apply'd &s;ufficient Diligence in comparing his Actions with the Rule pre&s;crib'd him, which in Mat|ters concerning moral Duties, is &s;o plain, both in the Law of Nature and Revelation, that he that runs may read it. And therefore he has no Rea&s;on to think, that &s;uch Errors &s;hall not be imputed. God has given Men a moral Law, plain and intelligible by every Body
<PB N="xii" REF="006120_0011_1027EB40772FE630">that has the exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, whereby they are to guide their Actions: And let a Man's Per&s;ua&s;ion be what it will as to certain Actions, it cannot alter the Nature of Things. 'Tis not his Opinion, but God's Law that makes Things Good or Evil, and therefore we &s;hall be for ever oblig'd to do &s;ome Actions, and forbear others, whatever our Per&s;ua&s;ion be, becau&s;e we cannot alter the Nature of Good and Evil. For if the moral Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s of Actions were to be mea&s;ur'd by Men's Opinions, then Duty and Sin would be the mo&s;t uncertain Things in the World; and what is Good or Evil to Day, would be the con|trary To-morrow as any Man's Opinion alters: But &s;uch Con&s;equences are intolerable. And therefore tho' a Man be convinc'd that &s;uch a Practice is forbid|den, he may be guilty of Sin, and damn'd for it too, if &s;uch Conviction lead him, in other Ca&s;es, to act again&s;t a plain Law of God.</P>
<P>THERE are Men among us who are convinc'd that the Doctrines of Chri&s;t forbid all Sorts of War, for which Rea&s;on, they &s;ay, they cannot in Con&s;cience join, or have any Hand in defending their Country with carnal Weapons. Now in An&s;wer to this I grant, that if a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence again&s;t a foreign Enemy be really forbidden by Chri&s;t, then they are not to be blam'd: For their refu&s;ing to join in &s;uch a Practice is, in this Ca&s;e, undoubtedly their Duty, even tho' their Country &s;hould be ruin'd without it, But then the Point we &s;tand upon is this: That what the &s;upream Magi&s;trate (whom by the Laws of God they are bound to obey in all Things lawful) requires of them, in commanding them to defend their Coun|try, is forbidden by no Law of Chri&s;t (as will appear in the following Treati&s;e) And therefore their being convinc'd that the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity forbid a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence again&s;t a foreign Enemy, will not acquit them from the Guil of di&s;obeying the Ma|gi&s;trate, who is the Ordinance of God. They are
<PB N="xiii" REF="006120_0012_1027EB43E6AB17F8">expre&s;ly commanded, both in the moral Law, and in the Go&s;pel, to obey Magi&s;trates; and their fal&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ion will never ju&s;tify their Breach of an expre&s;s Command of God. So that if God's Law commands me to obey the Magi&s;trate in all Things lawful, my fal&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ion that what the Magi&s;trate commands me is unlawful, will not acquit me from Sin before God, if I do di&s;obey him. To confirm this Rea&s;on|ing, let me a&s;k the following Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHEN St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought him&s;elf bound in Duty to per&s;ecute Chri&s;tians, was his Per&s;ecution &s;inful or no? Yes &s;urely, for he calls him&s;elf the greate&s;t of Sinners for that very Rea&s;on, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 13.15. And therefore a Man's thinking a Thing to be lawful, will not acquit him before God for doing that Thing, if it be again&s;t God's Law (as Per&s;ecution for Con&s;ci|ence in religious Speculations undoubtedly is.) Nor will a Man's thinking a Thing to be unlawful acquit him before God for omitting that Thing, if by &s;o do|ing he violate a plain Law of God in another Ca&s;e. Again, &s;uppo&s;e a Roman Catholick, who believes Popery to be the only true Religion, does in Obedi|ence to it wor&s;hip Images and the Ho&s;t. This Per|&s;on would certainly abhor the&s;e Practices did he think them to be idolatrous, but he believes them to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary Duties. And yet I pre&s;ume this <HI>V.</HI> will charge Roman Catholicks with Idolatry, tho' they di&s;claim it, and profe&s;s they do no more than their Duty, when they give divine Wor&s;hip to &s;uch Objects. And indeed they are certainly charged rightly in this; for if it be really Idolatry by God's Word to do &s;o, then it will be Idolatry in any Man to do &s;o, let his Per|&s;ua&s;ion be what it will. For a Man's fal&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ion doth not alter the Nature of Things. Now the Ca&s;e is alike in the Matter before us. For Di&s;obedience to the higher Powers is as properly a Sin, as wor&s;hip|ing a Creature is Idolatry; and he is as much a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, who thinks it his Duty to di&s;obey the Magi|&s;trate,
<PB N="xiv" REF="006120_0013_1027EB466110F740">as he is an Idolater, who thinks it his Duty to wor&s;hip a Creature. A Man's Mi&s;take, according to the greater or le&s;&s;er Culpability of it, will more or le&s;s excu&s;e him before God in both In&s;tances, but it cannot change the Nature either of Di&s;obedience or Idolatry.</P>
<P>NOW to apply this to the Ca&s;e under Con&s;idera|tion, That Protection is due from the Magi&s;trate to the Subject, and that the Subject is bound to obey the Magi&s;trate in all his lawful Commands, is undeni|ably evident, both from the moral Law and the Go&s;|pel. But that the Go&s;pel forbids a nece&s;&s;ary Self-de|fence again&s;t a foreign Enemy, can at mo&s;t be but probable; the fir&s;t is an undeniable Truth que&s;tioned by none; whereas the la&s;t is but a probable Opinion, believed by few. Here then is a Ca&s;e where there is a plain Competition between two Duties; the one is Obedience to a doubtful Precept of Chri&s;t, the other is Obedience to an indi&s;putable Law of God, <HI>viz.</HI> Protection from the Magi&s;trate, and Obedience from the Subject.</P>
<P>NOW this Ca&s;e is ea&s;ily determined, for when a Man doubts only on one Side (which is the Ca&s;e here) it is more rea&s;onable (if all other Con&s;iderations be e|qual) to chu&s;e that Side which he hath no Doubt of. But then (which I de&s;ire may be attentively con&s;ider'd) if there be other Circum&s;tances to overbalance that Con&s;ideration of Uncertainty (which is plainly the Ca&s;e with the <HI>V.</HI> and his Friends) it will be more rea|&s;onable to chu&s;e that Side which I did before doubt of. Nay, it is my Duty &s;o to do. For if I doubt, I do by doubting own that I cannot certainly tell whether the Action be lawful or unlawful; and &s;urely then the Weight of pre&s;&s;ing Con&s;iderations (which in this Ca&s;e are not wanting) &s;uch as the Pre&s;ervation of my Coun|try from Ruin, Obedience and Subjection to my Su|periors, and the like, ought to turn the Ballance; otherwi&s;e I cannot an&s;wer to God and the World for
<PB N="xv" REF="006120_0014_1027EB48D7EB90D0">the Con&s;equences that may en&s;ue. Thus for In&s;tance' If I have the &s;ole legi&s;lative Power of Government in my Hands, at a Juncture when the People are threat|ned with a foreign Inva&s;ion; I'm oblig'd, by Virtue of a former Obligation, notwith&s;tanding my Doubt as to the Lawfulne&s;s of bearing Arms, to make a legal Provi&s;ion for the publick Security. And then as to the Ca&s;e of Subjects, who are under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation, both by the moral Law and the Precepts of the Go&s;pel, to obey Magi&s;trates in all their lawful Commands, and which Obligation they are fully con|vinc'd of too without any Doubt; and &s;ince (as I &s;aid before) the Unlawfulne&s;s of bearing Arms in a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence can never be undeniably prov'd from Scripture, and mu&s;t therefore be a doubtful Ca&s;e; Their Duty, in Obedience to their Magi&s;trate's Command, is heartily to join in the Defence of the Publick, again&s;t a lawle&s;s, foreign Invader, whenever there &s;hall be Occa&s;ion for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Becau&s;e, as in all doubtful Ca&s;es, the &s;afe&s;t Side is to be cho&s;en; &s;o 'tis certain, it is &s;afer for them, in this Ca&s;e, to obey than di&s;obey. There is a plain Law of God that commands them to obey the Magi&s;trate in all lawful Things; and if his Command be unlawful, the only Hazard they run is, of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Pre|cept of which they were not certain: But in a doubt|ful Ca&s;e, it is very uncertain whether the Law of God forbid the Thing or no, and if the Command be law|ful, then in di&s;obeying they run the Hazard of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing a plain Law which they cannot but know, and which is of the greate&s;t Importance to the Pub|lick.</P>
<P>'TIS true (as I have ob&s;erv'd in the Treati&s;e) St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, he that doubteth is damn'd if he eat, be|cau&s;e he eateth not of Faith, for what&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 23. But pray let it be con|&s;idered, that there is a va&s;t Difference between this Ca&s;e, and that of tho&s;e I am arguing with. The
<PB N="xvi" REF="006120_0015_1027EB4B9EC05468">Man St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of, was at Liberty to forbear eating, and &s;inned in chu&s;ing to run &s;uch a needle&s;s Hazard of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Law (of giving no Of|fence to weak Brethren.) But when the Magi&s;trate commands the Subject to a&s;&s;i&s;t in defending their Country, they are not at Liberty. In the former Ca&s;e the Man might forbear without any Danger, but in the latter Ca&s;e there is greater Danger in for|bearing, than in acting, and therefore he is bound to act in the latter Ca&s;e, tho' it might be Sin to act in the former.</P>
<P>AS to my Method of examining this <HI>V</HI>'s Remarks on the afore&s;aid Sermon, I have this Apology to make for my&s;elf, that I had no other View in any Thing I have there &s;aid, but to vindicate Truth, and detect Error. If I have &s;aid &s;ome Things that may &s;eem to betray a Want of Temper for his abu&s;ing his Adver&s;ary, and impo&s;ing on the World under a &s;pe|cious Pretence of pleading for the Truth, I hope the Reader will be reconcil'd, when I a&s;&s;ure him, that it was neither from any Prejudice in Favour of the Author of the Sermon (to whom I am &s;o far a Stranger, that to my Knowledge I never exchang'd a Word with him) nor from any per&s;onal Prejudice again&s;t the <HI>V.</HI> or any of his Friends. But upon find|ing a Principle, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of civil Society (as a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence again&s;t a foreign Enemy is) attack'd by a Heap of Sophi&s;ms and wretched Arguments, contriv'd on Purpo&s;e to con|found and perplex what was not in his Power to con|fute, I thought it my Duty to lay them out in their true Colours, that the World may &s;ee wherein their boa&s;ted Strength lies. For I know many have boa&s;ted of this mighty Performance, as an unan&s;werable Piece. But &s;ure I am if it be, it is not upon the Ac|count of &s;olid Argument or &s;ound Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>FOR if either the Author or his Friends can &s;hew me but half a Dozen of Arguments in the whole Per|formance,
<PB N="xvii" REF="006120_0016_1027EB4F1EE3D258">that will bear the Te&s;t of Syllogi&s;m (the Touch&s;tone of right Arguing) I will own all I have &s;aid again&s;t him to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have made &s;o free with this <HI>V.</HI> upon any other Point of Controver&s;y we could po&s;&s;ibly have hit upon. But this being a Point of &s;uch va&s;t Con&s;e|quence to the whole Chri&s;tian World; the abu&s;ive Me|thod he has made U&s;e of in treating of it, cannot in my Opinion be too &s;martly reprehended.</P>
<P>AND it &s;eems not unnece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the Publick, that he &s;hould be told &s;o; that the next Time he has a Mind to publi&s;h a Vindication of this Doctrine, he may chu&s;e a more &s;ea&s;onable Opportu|nity, than when we are alarm'd with a foreign Inva|&s;ion. Had not this been the Ca&s;e, I do a&s;&s;ure him, I &s;hould have employ'd my Time much better, than in an Examination of his Vindication.</P>
<P>AND as to his Friends, I know many of them to be Men of too much good Sen&s;e to give into his &s;en&s;ele&s;s Sentiments on this Point. And as to tho&s;e who do, if they think I have done him any Wrong, I cannot hope they &s;hould &s;pare me. Only I beg Leave to give this friendly Caution to whom&s;oever &s;hall be appointed to an&s;wer this Piece (if they &s;hall think it worth an&s;wering) that they would lay a&s;ide that mean Trick of dealing in general eva&s;ive An|&s;wers, and u&s;ing equivocal Terms in &s;uch a Manner as to make them look two direct contrary Ways, together with &s;ome dark out-of-the-way Expre&s;&s;ions in their own Language, which have not &s;o much as the Face of an Argument, only that they may have it to &s;ay, there is an An&s;wer to &s;uch a Book. And if any one concern'd really for Truth, &s;hall under|take the Confutation of what I have here advanc'd, I &s;incerely promi&s;e him, either to recant my Mi|&s;take, upon fair Conviction, or u&s;e my be&s;t Endea|vours t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an&s;wer his Difficulties.</P>
<P>THIS Cau&s;e in Debate between us is of very great Con&s;equence; it concerns the whole Chri&s;tian
<PB N="xviii" REF="006120_0017_1027EB50A8102A20">World in general, and this unhappy Province in particular. That any Evidence in the Propo&s;al or Defence of it, can be &s;ufficient to conquer the Ob|&s;tinacy and Prejudices of a great many among us. I have not the Vanity to imagine. But this I think I may ju&s;tly demand of every Reader, that &s;ince there are great and vi&s;ible Fal&s;hoods on one Side or other, he would impartially examine on which Side they lie; and upon that I will venture the Cau&s;e in any Readers Judgment, who will but lay a&s;ide all Prejudice and Partiality, and come with a &s;incere Re&s;olution to embrace what, upon the greate&s;t E|vidence appears to be the Truth: And as for him that will not do that, I care not much either what he &s;ays or thinks.</P>
<P>AS to the Goodne&s;s of the Performance, I can &s;ay but little in its Favour. But if I have not &s;ucceed|ed in it according to my Wi&s;hes, I may plead that it was drawn up under a bad State of Health, amid&s;t a Variety of Interruptions, and a Famine both of Men and Books. This will in &s;ome Sort excu&s;e the Author, tho' it may detract from the Performance.</P>
<P>I SHALL make no other Apology for becoming an Author, than that it was partly to gratify the Im|portunity of my Friends, and partly to &s;atisfy every Man who has any &s;incere Affection for his Country, that it is not only lawful for him, but laudable and glorious to exert him&s;elf in its Defence, whenever he has a lawful Call thereto.</P>
<P>AS to whatever Cen&s;ures the Criticks may pa&s;s upon my Performance, this &s;hall give me no Manner of Concern; becau&s;e as Vermin are led by In&s;tinct to the be&s;t Fruits, &s;o (&s;aith a learned Writer) the&s;e Kind of In&s;ects &s;warm about the be&s;t Writers; &s;o that &s;hould they vouch&s;afe to allow me a Place a|mong the&s;e, they would do me an Honour, which I have not the Vanity to think I de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I HAVE no more to add, but that V. &s;tands for Vindicator.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE On the LAWFULNESS of <HI>DEFENSIVE WAR.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the be&s;t Things are mo&s;t apt to be abu&s;ed, &s;o the Abu&s;e of them generally produces very ill Con&s;equences. There is no Principle &s;o good, nor Practice &s;o beneficial, but what may be perverted to an ill U&s;e, by the Wickedne&s;s or Folly of Men. And this I take to be the Ca&s;e with relation to the Point now to be debated.</P>
<P>FOR tho' Self-pre&s;ervation be a noble Principle, ingrafted in our Nature by the all-wi&s;e Author of our Being, for the Security of our Lives, and the Pre&s;er|vation of the Species; yet wicked Men do often abu&s;e it to very ill Purpo&s;es. Whenever their Prejudices, Pa&s;&s;ions, or Intere&s;t, prompt them to fall foul on their innocent Neighbours, they always pretend that it is, &s;omehow or other, in Con&s;equence of the great Law of Self-pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>HENCE it comes to pa&s;s, that one of the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t u&s;eful Principles in Nature, and &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary for the Good of the whole Animal Creation, that the World could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, is per|verted

<PB N="4" REF="006120_0021_1027EB5B6AAF17F0">be left in Mens Power &s;till to do it. And in this Sen&s;e of the Word, I maintain Defen&s;ive War, un|der the Go&s;pel, to be lawful. For which Purpo&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to prove, in the fir&s;t Place, that &s;uch a War as I now plead for, was con&s;onant or agreeable to the Law of Nature, and not repugnant to any expre&s;s Law of God under the old Te&s;tament. By the Law of Nature, I mean the Dictate of right Rea&s;on, &s;hewing the moral Good or Evil of any Action, by the Repugnancy or Congruity it hath to rational Nature it&s;elf; and con&s;equently that &s;uch an Action is agreeable or di&s;agreeable to the Will of God, who is the very Author of Nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, Page 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE State of the Ca&s;e, therefore, is plainly this, A Defen&s;ive War, undertaken by lawful Authority, with no other View but to defend the innocent Lives and Liberties of the whole Community, when this cannot be done by any other Means, was ever con|&s;onant to the Law of Nature, and repugnant to no po&s;itive Law of God, under the Old Te&s;tament; and therefore it cannot be unlawful under the New, unle&s;s an expre&s;s po&s;itive Law of Chri&s;t can be pro|duc'd, prohibiting all Sorts of War under the Go&s;|pel. And if it be prov'd, that &s;uch a War is not unlawful, it will be enough for my Purpo&s;e; for if it be not unlawful, it will be no Violation of any Law, and con&s;equently can be no Sin.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to prove in the fir&s;t Place, That Defen&s;ive War was con&s;onant, or agreeable, to the Law of Nature, and not repugnant to any ex|pre&s;s Law of God under the Old Te&s;tament: And this I &s;hall do, by Arguments drawn, both from Rea&s;on and Revelation. Whence it will evidently follow, as a Re&s;olution of the Que&s;tion, that it is lawful, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, for Chri&s;tians to make War under the Go&s;pel; becau&s;e what was once lawful, by Virtue of the Law of Nature, mu&s;t forever be &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="006120_0022_1027EB5CF57B5478">(the Grounds and Rea&s;ons continuing the &s;ame) un|le&s;s made otherwi&s;e by a po&s;itive Law of God.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Defen&s;ive War was con&s;onant to the Law of Nature, and not repugnant to any ex|pre&s;s Law of God, under the Old Te&s;tament, will appear from the following Arguments:</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE are &s;ome Things to which every Man (at lea&s;t before the Ca&s;e is altered by voluntary Com|pact) has &s;uch a natural and immediate Relation, that he only, of all Mankind, can ju&s;tly call them his; &s;uch as his Life, his Limbs, his Liberty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence it follows, that no other Man can have a Right to begin an Attempt upon this Man's Life, or in any Manner to di&s;turb his Happine&s;s, becau&s;e he is &s;uppos'd to be in a State intirely independent, and that other to have no Right of Dominion over him.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho' no Man can have a Right to begin to hurt another, yet every Man has a Right to defend him&s;elf, and his, again&s;t Violence, when offered (always &s;uppo&s;ing the Ca&s;e not to be altered by voluntary Compact) for I do not &s;ay that a Man who is become a Member of Society, has, in all Ca&s;es, a Right to defend him&s;elf again&s;t even lawle&s;s Violence, for Rea&s;ons that are obvious almo&s;t to every Body; and far le&s;s to defend him&s;elf a|gain&s;t lawful Violence, when he has incurred it, by violating the Laws of the Community to which he belongs. I &s;ay then (excepting this Ca&s;e) every Man, and con&s;equently every independent Society of Men, have a Right to defend them&s;elves, and what is theirs, again&s;t lawle&s;s Violence. Now who|ever denies a Man (thus circum&s;tanc'd) this Privi|lege, a&s;&s;erts, contrary to Truth, either that he hath not the Faculties and Powers which he has, or that his Maker has given them to him in vain; for to what End has he them, if he may not u&s;e them? And how may he u&s;e them, if not for his own Pre&s;ervation,
<PB N="6" REF="006120_0023_1027EB5FC4399E88">when he is attack'd, and in Danger of being de|&s;troy'd? At this Rate, what becomes of the univer|&s;al invariable Principle of Self-pre&s;ervation, implant|ed by the Author of Nature in the whole Animal Creation, which &s;erves for no Purpo&s;e that we know of, but to pre&s;erve Individuals, by prompting them to provide for, and defend them&s;elves?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To deny Men a Right to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t Violence and Ruin, mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of human Nature, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with the general Good of Mankind; for whatever is incon&s;i&s;tent with the general Peace and Welfare of Mankind, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of human Nature, and therefore wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> IF a Man has no Right to defend him|&s;elf, he can have no Right to any Thing; but 'tis allowed on all Hands, that every Man has &s;uch a natural Right to his Life, his Limbs, his Liberty, &amp;c. that he only, of all Mankind, can ju&s;tly call them his: If therefore a Man has a Right, he may ju&s;tly maintain that Right. It implies a great Ab&s;urdity then, to deny a Man a Right to defend him&s;elf a|gain&s;t lawle&s;s Violence; becau&s;e it is &s;aying, contra|ry to what is granted by all, that the Aggre&s;&s;or has a Right to a&s;&s;ault the other, and u&s;urp what is his. And more than that, to begin the Violence, being in Nature more than to repel it, he who begins, is the true Cau&s;e of all that follows, and whatever falls upon him by the Oppo&s;ition made from the defending Party, is but the Effect of his own Act, or it is that Violence of which he is the Author, reflected back upon him&s;elf. If then he who begins to violate the Life and Happine&s;s of another, evidently does what is wrong, he who endeavours to put a Stop to that Violence, does in that Re&s;pect what is right by the Terms.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> IF every Man, before all voluntary Com|pact, has &s;uch a Right to his Life, his Limbs, his
<PB N="7" REF="006120_0024_1027EB63860EE740">Liberty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that he only of all Mankind can ju&s;tly call them his; he certainly acts agreeable to Right in u&s;ing them as his; but that Man who oppo&s;es him in this, and con&s;equently lays a claim to that which is not his, acts contrary to Right.</P>
<P>IN fine: As every Man is oblig'd to con&s;ult his own Happine&s;s, there can be no Doubt, but that he not only may, but even ought to defend it; becau&s;e as I am oblig'd to pur&s;ue Happine&s;s, I'm oblig'd, at the &s;ame time, to recede as far as I can from its Contrary.</P>
<P>I OWN in &s;o doing, I ought not to act ra&s;hly, or do more than the End propos'd requires; I ought to u&s;e all prudent Methods to &s;top the Violence; but when all other Mea&s;ures prove ineffectual, or impracticable, I mu&s;t take &s;uch other as I can, and oppo&s;e Force to Force; otherwi&s;e I will fail in my Duty to my&s;elf, and deny Happine&s;s to be what it is.</P>
<P>NOW to apply this Rea&s;oning to Societies, let it be ob&s;erv'd, that the Condition of an incorporated na|tional Society or Kingdom, &s;eems to be much the &s;ame with a &s;ingle Per&s;on, as con&s;ider'd exi&s;ting where there is no Benefit of Law to be had; and what one Man may ju&s;tly do to another in that Po|&s;ition, may be done by one Nation or politick Body, with Re&s;pect to another. If one Man therefore may in &s;uch a Po&s;ition have a Right to defend him&s;elf, which that he hath, is evident from the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things; then a Number of Men mu&s;t have an equal Right at lea&s;t, if not a greater; for there is more Rea&s;on that a Number of innocent Men &s;hould be &s;aved, than only one of that Number, and therefore that a Number &s;hould defend them&s;elves, than that one &s;hould. And if this may be done by every &s;ingle Per&s;on in a State of Nature, before the Ca&s;e is alter'd by voluntary Compact, it may be done by them in a &s;ocial State, when confederated
<PB N="8" REF="006120_0025_1027EB66283A08E0">among them&s;elves; becau&s;e with re&s;pect to other Nations they are &s;till in that State, &s;o far as they have not limited them&s;elves by Leagues and Alliances.</P>
<P>UPON the whole therefore, mutual Defence being one great End of civil Society, if not the greate&s;t, it mu&s;t in a particular and eminent Manner, involve in it Defence again&s;t foreign Enemies: And there|fore, as I &s;aid before, whoever from a Principle of Genero&s;ity and Love to his Country, and not in Pur|&s;uance of private Views, &s;ignalizes him&s;elf in its Defence when there is Occa&s;ion for it, does what is agreeable to the eternal Law of Truth and Right, and ju&s;tly de&s;erves the grateful Acknowledgments of every good Subject, and Lover of his King and Country.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e Truths, as they are built upon the in|di&s;putable Principles of right Rea&s;on, and in a Man|ner &s;elf-evident, will, I think, readily be granted by all Men of &s;ound Judgment, without any farther Il|lu&s;tration.</P>
<P>I SHALL proceed therefore in the</P>
<P>2d. PLACE, to prove from Revelation, that Defen|&s;ive War was con&s;onant to the Law of Nature under the Old Te&s;tament, whence it will appear at the &s;ame Time, that it was not repugnant to any po&s;itive Law of God under that Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>NOW that War commenc'd upon ju&s;t Grounds, was con&s;onant to the Law of Nature, and not repug|nant to the reveal'd Will of God under the Old Te&s;ta|ment, will appear from the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>WE find, <HI>Gen.</HI> xiv. that the Almighty, by his high Prie&s;t <HI>Melchi&s;edeck,</HI> did approve of a War made by his Servant <HI>Abraham</HI> upon the four Kings; who in plundering <HI>Sodom,</HI> had taken <HI>Lot</HI> and his Family Captives, who was <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Brother's Son, and as it were, a Part of his own Family. The Text &s;ays, <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Abraham,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be Abraham of the mo&s;t high God Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven
<PB N="9" REF="006120_0026_1027EB68E1085450">and Earth:</HI> v. 20. <HI>And ble&s;&s;ed be the mo&s;t high God, who bath deliver'd thine Enemies into thine Hand.</HI> Now here was a War made by this eminent Servant of God, without any &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion from the Almighty for it; but he was excited thereto by the meer Law of Nature; pre&s;uming upon that Principle of Nature, that to re&s;i&s;t, and recompence lawle&s;s In|juries, was not di&s;plea&s;ing to the God of Nature. <HI>Who&s;o &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed,</HI> &s;eems to have been deeply engraven in Mens Hearts from the Beginning; which made <HI>Cain,</HI> after the Murder of his Brother, cry out, <HI>Every one that findeth me &s;hall &s;lay me.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the War made by the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> upon the Seven Nations, I &s;hall wholly omit any Con&s;ideration of it here, as having no Relation to this Argument: In this Ca&s;e they were not excited by the Law of Na|ture, but acted by Virtue of an expre&s;s Command of God. This Action therefore comes intirely within the Verge of the judicial Law, which being long &s;ince expir'd, is therefore quite out of this Que&s;tion. Tho&s;e Actions therefore that were lawful for the <HI>Jews,</HI> may not be drawn into Example by us Chri&s;tians, be|cau&s;e the Rea&s;on of them ceas'd when their Law ex|pir'd. I &s;ay there were many Things lawful for the <HI>Jews</HI> as a Body Politick, under a Theocratical Go|vernment, which cannot be lawfully practi&s;ed under the Go&s;pel, becau&s;e the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Things do not de&s;cend to Chri&s;tians. But all tho&s;e Practices among the Jews, which are founded upon common Equity, of which Number was that of Defen&s;ive War, may lawfully be practis'd by Chri&s;tians, not by Virtue of their having been practi&s;ed by them, but by Virtue of common Principles of Equity founded in the Law of Nature, and di&s;coverable by our rational Faculties.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch a War as was carried on by good Men, without any expre&s;s Command of God, and yet was manife&s;tly approv'd of by the Almighty, mu&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="006120_0027_1027EB6B84CAEDC0">have been undertaken upon &s;uch Principles, as were not repugnant to his Nature, el&s;e he would never have approv'd of it; and what could tho&s;e be but the Principles of the Law of Nature, which were written in their Hearts; &s;ince they had no Sy&s;tem of moral Practice at that Time by Revelation?</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the 17th of <HI>Exodus,</HI> we find, that a War was commenc'd by the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> under the Com|mand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who had oppo&s;ed them in their Pa&s;&s;age towards the promis'd Land; which, tho' it was not command|ed to be done, yet being done, had the divine Ap|probation, <HI>v.</HI> 14. which certainly would not have been, if it had been repugnant to the Law of Nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. AND <HI>Deut.</HI> xx. we find God him&s;elf pre&s;cri|bing certain general Rules, or &s;tanding Ordinances, how his own People &s;hould make War; which is a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony that War might &s;ometimes be ju&s;t, tho' Men have no &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion from God to make this or that War.</P>
<P>FOR there <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> makes a manife&s;t Difference be|tween the Ca&s;e of the Seven Nations, and the Ca&s;e of other People, as appears from the 10th and 15th Ver&s;es. For other People they might receive to Mercy, but they were to cut off the &s;even Nations utterly.</P>
<P>NOW what I would ob&s;erve from hence, is this, That &s;eeing the Almighty did not pre&s;cribe for what particular Cau&s;es they might make a ju&s;t War, how could the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> judge of tho&s;e Cau&s;es, or di&s;co|ver when the Grounds of &s;uch a War were ju&s;t, but by the Law of Nature? Of this Nature, was that of <HI>Jephthah</HI> with the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> and that of King <HI>David,</HI> for the Abu&s;e done to his Amba&s;&s;adors; and, as &s;ome think, that of <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> And forasmuch as tho&s;e Wars, which they carried on without any &s;pecial Command, as to the Objects and Circum&s;tances of them, were ap|proved by God, they certainly were agreeable to the
<PB N="11" REF="006120_0028_1027EB6E2924D640">Law of Nature; becau&s;e he can approve of nothing done by his Creatures, that is not agreeable either to that, or to his expre&s;s Command.</P>
<P><Q>ADD to this the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of all Nations. And it is, at lea&s;t, highly probable, that what all Nations in the World unanimou&s;ly agree in, is a Dictate of the Law of Nature: For if the Effect be univer&s;al, the Cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;o too. But of &s;o univer&s;al a Per&s;ua&s;ion as the Lawfulne&s;s of De|fen&s;ive War, no other probable Cau&s;e can be a&s;|&s;ign'd, than that it is a Dictate of that Law, that is as univer&s;al as Nature it&s;elf. Hence we commonly &s;ay, and I think with a great deal of Rea&s;on, that what&s;oever all Nations do grant, mu&s;t needs be the Voice of Nature. What appears the &s;ame to all Men, mu&s;t undoubt|edly be true.</Q> And tho' there may be a few that di&s;believe the Ju&s;tice of Defen&s;ive War, yet that doth not invalidate the Force of this Argument; forasmuch as there is no general Rule without Ex|ceptions. When I &s;ay, That mu&s;t be a Dictate of Nature, that is acknowledged by all; I mean, all who have &s;ound Judgments: But if it appear other|wi&s;e to Men of di&s;temper'd and perver&s;e Minds, who have been corrupted thro' an evil Education, imparted to them by Men of vi&s;ionary, enthu&s;ia&s;tick Tempers, it doth not in the lea&s;t weaken the Au|thority of the Law of Nature, no more than it will prove Honey not to be &s;weet, becau&s;e a di&s;temper'd Palate cannot perceive it. From all which, I hope, it evidently appears, to Men of &s;ound and unpreju|dic'd Minds, that Defen&s;ive War was lawful under the Old Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation. We &s;ee it was commenc'd and carried on by good Men, without any expre&s;s Command of God authorizing them; and therefore they mu&s;t have been prompted to it by the Law of Nature, as they had no Sy&s;tem of moral Duties by Revelation; and the Practice mu&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="006120_0029_1027EB70CC9C1A88">have been agreeable thereto, otherwi&s;e Almighty God, who cannot but hate every Thing that is con|trary to his Will, would never have &s;hewn his Ap|probation of it.</P>
<P>HAVING therefore undeniably prov'd, that Defen|&s;ive War was lawful under the Old Te&s;tament, it evidently follows as a Re&s;olution of the Que&s;tion to be di&s;cu&s;s'd, that it is lawful for Chri&s;tians in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to make War under the New, becau&s;e what was once lawful by Virtue of the Law of Nature, mu&s;t for ever be &s;o (the Grounds and Rea&s;ons conti|nuing the &s;ame) unle&s;s made otherwi&s;e by a po&s;itive Law of God. It being the Nature of Laws to bound up Men's Rights, what is not expre&s;ly forbidden in the Go&s;pel, which was agreeable to the Will of God under the Law, by Virtue of the Law of Nature, that mu&s;t be lawful for Chri&s;tians to practi&s;e &s;till (the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of &s;uch a Practice continuing the &s;ame.) My Meaning is this; Defen&s;ive War being nece&s;&s;ary under the Old Te&s;tament for the Pre&s;erva|tion of civil Society, was lawfully practis'd by good Men; but Defen&s;ive War being as nece&s;&s;ary under the Go&s;pel for the like Purpo&s;e, may be lawfully prac|tis'd now, as well as then; unle&s;s it can be made ap|pear that the Author of the Go&s;pel has made an expre&s;s po&s;itive Law again&s;t all War what&s;oever.</P>
<P>AND here I might re&s;t the Cau&s;e, without giving my&s;elf any further Trouble; becau&s;e as my Oppo|nents, if they will &s;upport their Argument, mu&s;t hold the Affirmative, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is &s;uch a Law in the New Te&s;tament (which I deny) 'tis indi&s;pen|&s;ibly incumbent upon them to prove it. For by the &s;tricte&s;t Laws of Rea&s;oning, he that maintains the Negative of a Que&s;tion, may per&s;i&s;t to deny the Affirmative, 'till &s;uch Times as the Affirmant &s;hall prove what he affirms.</P>
<P>WHOEVER therefore &s;hall affirm, that Chri&s;t hath by an expre&s;s Law forbidden all Defen&s;ive War under
<PB N="13" REF="006120_0030_1027D91ECD3E9060">the New Te&s;tament, ought by all Means to prove it; it being a Matter of &s;uch re&s;t Importance to human Society other Way. For if he hath not, how will they an&s;wer for it who act as if he had? And if he hath, how will they an&s;wer for it who act as if he had not? To a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a Thing therefore without Proof, and in Con&s;equence thereof, to act as if it were prov'd, certainly merits a &s;evere Reprehen&s;ion. For if there be &s;uch a Law in the New Te&s;tament, it mu&s;t be an ea&s;y Matter for the&s;e Men to produce it, which if they do, and can prove that our Savi|our intended it as &s;uch, I think every true Chri&s;tian is bound to thank them for the Di&s;covery, and never to appear in Arms any more. But if they &s;ail in this, as I'm confident they will, they are bound in Duty, not only to acknowledge their Fault, in condem|ning Men for a Practice &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Protec|tion of civil Societies, when they can &s;hew no Law they tran&s;gre&s;s thereby, but to lay a&s;ide their groundle&s;s Prejudices them&s;elves, that &s;o they may be able to an&s;wer o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the greate&s;t Ends for which they entered into Society, <HI>viz.</HI> Mutual Defence a|gain&s;t Injuries.</P>
<P>I no therefore in the Name and on the Behalf of the whole Chri&s;tian World, who are in the Practice of Self-defence again&s;t lawle&s;s Violence, call upon them to produce any Pa&s;&s;age or Pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament, which will amount to a Law pro|hibiting Defen&s;ive War in all Ca&s;es without Excepti|on. I &s;ay, which will amount to a Law (for any Thing that comes &s;hort of this, will not &s;erve the Turn) becau&s;e, as I have already prov'd, &s;ome Wars having been lawful under the Old Te&s;tament by Virtue of the Law of Nature, and the divine Approbation, nothing can make all War unlawful under the Go&s;|pel, but an expre&s;s Law enacted by the Author of the Go&s;pel prohibiting it; for an expre&s;s po&s;itive Command, as I ob&s;erved above, is not nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="14" REF="006120_0031_1027EB7256C64AB0">make a Thing lawful under the Go&s;pel, which was always agreeable to the Dictates of the Law of Na|ture; it is &s;ufficient for that, if there be no Law made again&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT that I may not be thought to evade the Force of what they have to offer from the New Te&s;tament, in Oppo&s;ition to what I have advanc'd, I will conde&s;cend to examine two or three of the principal Texts, upon which they lay the greate&s;t Stre&s;s for Proof of the Unlawfulne&s;s of bearing Arms. The Fir&s;t is written in the 33d Ver&s;e of the 5th Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> the Words are the&s;e; <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, that ye re&s;i&s;t not Evil.</HI> The Se|cond is in the 44th Ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chapter, in the&s;e Words; <HI>But I &s;ay unto you, Love your Ene|mies,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW granting that the&s;e Words will amount to an evangelical Precept or Law, prohibiting &s;ome Things, which the <HI>Jews,</HI> thro' the corrupt Glo&s;&s;es of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, look'd upon as indif|ferent Actions, tho' really contrary to the Law of Nature; &s;uch as Revenge, Impatience under Af|flictions, returning Injuries, and the like; which, in certain Circum&s;tances, have ever been, and ever will be Evil: Yet we can find no Colour of Rea&s;on to allow, that they amount to a Precept or Law prohibiting Chri&s;tian States to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of a foreign Enemy; or that the great evangelical Lawgiver had any In|tention they &s;hould, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE in delivering the&s;e Words, he doth not addre&s;s his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Magi&s;trate, who a|lone hath a Right to declare War, but to the Per|&s;on injured. A Man may without any Breach of the Law of Nature, for &s;ome valuable Ends, remit &s;omewhat of his own private Right; but the Ma|gi&s;trate who &s;u&s;tains a publick Character, and is in|tru&s;ted with the Care of a whole Community, can|not
<PB N="15" REF="006120_0032_1027EB73E39B0D20">give up the Rights of his Subjects, without a manife&s;t Violation of this Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHERE the Law of Nature doth determine a|ny Thing by Way of Duty, as flowing from the Principles of it, which we take to be the Ca&s;e with relation to Self-defence again&s;t a foreign Enemy, there no po&s;itive Law can be &s;uppos'd to take off the Obligation of it. For the Things commanded by the Law of Nature being ju&s;t and righteous in them&s;elves, there can be no obligatory Law made a|gain&s;t &s;uch Things. A Man may be as well bound not to be a Man, as not to act according to Princi|ples of Rea&s;on. For the Law of Nature is nothing but the Dictate of right Rea&s;on, di&s;covering the Good or Evil of particular Actions, from their Conformity or Repugnancy to the Nature and Rea|&s;on of Things. Whatever po&s;itive Law is then made directly infringing and violating natural Princi|ples, is thereby of no Force at all; and that which hath no Obligation in it&s;elf, cannot di&s;&s;olve a former Obligation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'TIS a Dictate of the Law of Nature that Men &s;hould enter into Society by mutual Compacts, in order the better to pre&s;erve them&s;elves in their natu|ral Rights and Privileges by &s;uch Means as are pro|per for that End.</P>
<P>NOW the greate&s;t Rights of Men are &s;uch as flow from Nature it&s;elf; and therefore, as no Law binds again&s;t the Rea&s;on of it, &s;o neither can it again&s;t the common End of Laws. Therefore, if a po&s;i|tive Law &s;hould be made, that Men &s;hould not protect and defend them&s;elves again&s;t lawle&s;s Vio|lence, it cannot bind, being again&s;t the main End of Laws, which is, that every civil Society be protected and pre&s;erved; which, in many Ca&s;es, cannot be done, without doing what Nature requires; and
<PB N="16" REF="006120_0033_1027EB7B8B951680">that is to defend them&s;elves from unju&s;t Vio|lence.</P>
<P>AND therefore we conclude, that Self-defence a|gain&s;t lawle&s;s Violence, being a Dictate of the Law of Nature, no po&s;itive Law can be made to di&s;annul our Obligation to it, and con&s;equently that our Sa|viour did not intend by the&s;e Precepts to prohibit it in all Ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHATSOEVER binds Chri&s;tians as an univer|&s;al, &s;tanding Law, mu&s;t be clearly revealed as &s;uch, and laid down in Scripture in &s;uch evident Terms, as all who have their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed therein, may di&s;cern it to have been the Will of Chri&s;t that it &s;hould perpetually oblige all Chri&s;tians. And this is nece&s;&s;ary more e&s;pecially in e&s;tabli&s;hing a new Law, in order to prohibit a Practice which had been lawful before. If therefore our Saviour had intend|ed the&s;e Words as a &s;tanding, univer&s;al Law, binding all Chri&s;tians in no Ca&s;e to take Arms in their own Defence again&s;t lawle&s;s Violence, he would un|doubtedly have declar'd him&s;elf in &s;uch di&s;tinct Terms, and in &s;uch a plain Dre&s;s of Words, as &s;hould have been liable to no Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion; it being highly nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, where the Matter of the Law was &s;o weighty, and &s;o new.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as all other Nations, had been bred in the full Conviction of the Lawfulne&s;s of Self-defence again&s;t unju&s;t Violence, it having been practi&s;ed all along from the Beginning of the World to that Time. If our Saviour therefore had intended by an expre&s;s po&s;itive Law to prohibit it under the Go&s;pel, he would undoubtedly have expre&s;s'd him&s;elf in &s;o plain and intelligible a Manner, as every Man of &s;ound Judgment might have readily under&s;tood: As, <HI>Let no Man from henceforth take up Arms to de|fend him&s;elf in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever;</HI> or in Words as ea&s;y to be under&s;tood. This I &s;ay was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in publi&s;hing a new Law of &s;uch mighty
<PB N="17" REF="006120_0034_1027EB7D164D26F8">Con&s;equence; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that the Words were addre&s;s'd to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who could not conceive nor imagine but that they were obliged by the judicial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o long as their Common-Wealth &s;hould &s;tand.</P>
<P>BUT this I apprehend to be very far from the Ca&s;e with the Words in Que&s;tion: For in order, with any Colour of Rea&s;on, to make them amount to a Law prohibiting Self-defence in all Ca&s;es, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood without any Re&s;tricti|on or Limitation; but if they mu&s;t be under&s;tood without any Re&s;triction or Limitation, they will prove more than my Opponents want them to prove, <HI>viz.</HI> That we mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t neither moral nor natural Evil. At this Rate, it will be unlawful to re&s;i&s;t a Robber or Cut-Throat; it will be unlawful for the mo&s;t virtuous Matron to re&s;i&s;t a Ravi&s;her; for a Father to re&s;i&s;t the Violence of an unnatural Child; or for a Ma&s;ter to re&s;i&s;t the violent In&s;ults of undutiful Servants: Nay, it will be unlawful to re&s;i&s;t even the Devil and the &s;tronge&s;t Temptations to Sin, contrary to the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel. It will likewi&s;e be unlawful to re&s;i&s;t natural Evil, &s;uch as a raging Conflagration, an overflowing In|undation, a mad Dog, or any wild Bea&s;t, that is rea|dy to devour us. By Virtue of this Precept, if ta|ken in an unlimited Sen&s;e, it will be unlawful for the Magi&s;trate to puni&s;h Malefactors with Death, and to put a Stop to other Enormities committed by his evil Subjects again&s;t the publick Peace of the Community; and &s;o by this Means he will bear the Sword in vain, and neither be a Terror to Evil-do|ers, nor a Prai&s;e to them that do well, contrary to the expre&s;s Words of the great Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE I conclude, that our Saviour never intended by the&s;e Words, <HI>Re&s;i&s;t not Evil,</HI> to bind all Chri&s;tians, in all Ages, never to take up Arms in their own Defence, in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever; more
<PB N="18" REF="006120_0035_1027EB7EA8E67198">than he intended thereby to bind them never to re&s;i&s;t either moral or natural Evil, or to bind the Chri&s;ti|an Magi&s;trate never to puni&s;h the Crimes of his e|vil Subjects.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee how improper the&s;e Words are to prove the Point in Que&s;tion: For if they be taken in an unlimited Sen&s;e, they will prove a great deal too much; and if we take them in a limited Sen&s;e, they will not come up to the End de&s;ign'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To prove the Unlawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War in all Ca|&s;es.</P>
<P>AND as for tho&s;e Words, <HI>v.</HI> 44th, <HI>Love your E|nemies,</HI> &amp;c. neither will the&s;e prove any &s;uch Law as is here demanded; becau&s;e the Term, <HI>Enemies,</HI> being applicable either to private or publick Ene|mies, we cannot be certain which our Saviour meant; whether he meant only tho&s;e who may be at Enmity with us in the Society where we live, or foreign E|nemies, to whom we &s;tand in no other Relation than as we are Men; or la&s;tly, whether he meant all Sorts of Enemies, whether foreign or dome&s;tick. What Rea&s;on any Man hath to under&s;tand the Words in either the &s;econd or third Sen&s;e, I cannot conceive; but that they ought to be under&s;tood in the fir&s;t, &s;eems evident from hence, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Law, which the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had perverted and ob&s;cured by their fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es, commanded the <HI>Jews</HI> to love their Neighbburs; by whom they un|der&s;tood <HI>Jews</HI> and their Pro&s;elytes: But tho&s;e Laws which forbad them to do Hurt, reach'd even to tho&s;e uncircumci&s;ed Strangers that liv'd among them, as appears from <HI>Lev.</HI> xix. 18. <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> And v. 34. <HI>The Stranger that &s;ojourneth with you, &s;hall be as one Home-born a|mong you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf; for ye were Strangers in the Land of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>YE <HI>have heard,</HI> &s;aith our Saviour, <HI>that it hath been &s;aid, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine
<PB N="19" REF="006120_0036_1027EB804BF8AAB0">Enemy. Hate thine Enemy</HI> was a fal&s;e Glo&s;s, added by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; for the&s;e Words are not to be found in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> This Law, I &s;ay, commanded the <HI>Jews</HI> to love their Neigh|bours, uncircumci&s;ed Strangers among them, as well as tho&s;e of their own Nation.</P>
<P>NOW what I would ob&s;erve from hence is this, That notwith&s;tanding this Precept of loving their Neighbours, the eleven Tribes did ju&s;tly make War again&s;t the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> for a mo&s;t bar|barous Piece of Villainy committed by them, of which we read, <HI>Judges</HI> xix.</P>
<P>SO, notwith&s;tanding this Precept, did holy <HI>David,</HI> who is &s;aid in Scripture to fight the Lord's Battles, recover by Force of Arms the Kingdom that was promis'd to him; and yet we do not find that he was ever blam'd for it.</P>
<P>WHY then might not our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour enjoin Chri&s;tians to love Enemies, and yet not thereby o|blige them to &s;uffer all Sorts of unlawful Violence from them, as well as the God of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> en|join'd them to love their Neighbours, and yet did not make it unlawful for them to make War upon tho&s;e very Neighbours, when there was ju&s;t Ground for it? If it was not unlawful for the <HI>Jews,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding God's Precept to them, <HI>Ye &s;hall love your Neighbours as your&s;elves,</HI> to make War upon their Brethren and Neighbours, when there was ju&s;t Ground for it; it can with no Colour of Rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to be unlawful for Chri&s;tians to make War upon a foreign Enemy, when there is ju&s;t Grounds for it, from Chri&s;t's Words, <HI>Love your Enemies.</HI> Becau&s;e as the <HI>Jews</HI> did love their Neighbours, and yet &s;ometimes did lawfully make War upon them; &s;o may Chri&s;tians love Enemies, and yet &s;ometimes lawfully make War again&s;t them, to defend them|&s;elves from unju&s;t Violence.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006120_0037_1027EB8449649250">
BUT I expect it will be &s;aid, that the Go&s;pel re|quires an higher Degree of Love than what was re|quired by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law: All which I readily grant; but even then it will not follow, that we mu&s;t love all with an equal Degree of Love; our Parents and Children, I hope, are to be pre|ferred before Strangers; and our Neighbours before our Enemies. If this be granted, it will follow, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> that I ought to prefer my own Life before the Life of my Enemy; then of Con&s;equence I ought to de&s;troy the Life of my Enemy, if I can by no other Means po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave my own.</P>
<P>AS 'tis out of Love to the Righteous, that the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate puts the Wicked to Death; &s;o it is out of Regard for the publick Good, that he makes War in Defence of his innocent Subjects. In order to pre&s;erve the publick Peace, he makes War again&s;t tho&s;e that di&s;turb it.</P>
<P>IF it be rea&s;onable that the greater Obligation &s;hould bind us to the &s;tricter Duty (and that it is &s;o, no rea&s;onable Man will deny) then it will follow, that we cannot in Rea&s;on be bound to pre&s;erve the Guilty, when in &s;o doing we de&s;troy the Innocent. Let it be &s;uppos'd, that by Virtue of this Precept, <HI>Love your Enemies,</HI> we are bound to love them as our&s;elves, which yet I pre&s;ume is more than can with any Shew of Rea&s;on be inferred from the Words; yet we are not to love them above our|&s;elves. Now &s;uppo&s;ing us both to be involv'd in the &s;ame Danger, I would &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k tho&s;e who are again&s;t all Defence by Force of Arms, who&s;e Safety we are to prefer?

St. <HI>Matthew</HI> v. 42. our Saviour ex|pre&s;ly &s;ays, <HI>Give to him that a&s;keth.</HI> And in St. <HI>Luke</HI> the Words are, <HI>Give to every Man that a&s;keth of thee, and of him that taketh away thy Goods, a&s;k them not again.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if this general Precept to Chri&s;tians, ought to be under&s;tood with a Limitation, why not tho&s;e which are brought to prove the Unlawfulne&s;s of Re|&s;i&s;tance in all Ca&s;es? Nay, there is more Rea&s;on to re&s;train the&s;e latter than the former, not only from the Nature of the Thing, but from our Saviour's own following Words. For when he &s;ays, <HI>Re&s;i&s;t not Evil,</HI> the Precept following &s;eems to re&s;train the Words preceding, as if they were too general. <HI>But if any Man &s;trike thee on one Cheek,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>turn to him the other.</HI> Which Words plainly intimate, that our Saviour meant only &s;uch Injuries as were &s;light, and therefore ea&s;y to be borne.

But when he &s;ays, <HI>Give to every one that a&s;k|eth thee,</HI> he adds no Words to re&s;train his Meaning, but leaves it to the Judgment of common Equity and Di&s;cretion.

<P>WHEN the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity &s;hall be uni|ver&s;ally embrac'd among the Nations, which we be|lieve will be the Ca&s;e before the End of the World; when the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hall be converted, and all Nations &s;incerely embrace Chri&s;tianity; then there will be an univer&s;al Peace: <HI>Nation &s;hall not lift up Sword a|gain&s;t Nation, nor Kingdom again&s;t Kingdom, neither &s;hall they learn War any more:</HI> Then they may beat their Swords into Plow&s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, becau&s;e there will be no U&s;e for them: But it does not follow from hence, that 'tis unlawful to u&s;e them before that Time come.

All we contend for is, that it is the only Means under God, as far as we have any rea&s;onable Grounds to believe, for this Purpo&s;e.

'Tis true God can pro|tect us from the greate&s;t Violence, without any of our Endeavours; but it is one Thing what God can do, and another what he will or does do, in the general Cour&s;e of his Providence.

<P>HE could have recovered <HI>Hezckiah,</HI> when he was &s;ick unto Death; and yet, we find, he was ordered by a Prophet, to take a Lump of Figs, and to lay it upon the Boil, upon which he recovered, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xx. 7.</P>
<P>GOD Almighty, if he plea&s;ed, could not only keep us from, but cure us of, all Di&s;ea&s;es, by his all-powerful Providence; and yet he not only per|mits, but requires us in Holy Scripture, to u&s;e all pru|dent Methods of re&s;i&s;ting and &s;topping their Fury; and is far from expecting that we &s;hould lie down and do nothing to &s;ave our &s;elves from peri&s;hing in &s;uch Calamities.</P>

<P>AND thus I have endeavoured to make it appear, that tho&s;e Texts, which are the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwark for &s;upporting the Doctrine of the Unlawfulne&s;s of War in all Ca&s;es under the Go&s;pel, cannot amount to a Law prohibiting Chri&s;tians to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of a foreign Enemy.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome other Texts alledged by our Adver&s;aries, in favour of this Doctrine; but none of them I think can even be pretended to amount to a Law; but are only to be adduced as collateral Proofs; the two I have already confider|ed, being the chief Ba&s;is upon which the whole of their Doctrine is built.</P>
<P>I SHALL examine one other Text, which, next to the&s;e, &s;eems mo&s;t to favour their Doctrine; and that is written, Rom. xii. 17. <HI>Recompence to no Max Evil for Evil: Dearly beloved, avenge not your &s;elves,
<PB N="28" REF="006120_0045_1027EB9C43D0CA98">but rather give place unto Wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, &s;aith the Lord; therefore if thine Enemy bunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him Drink,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the&s;e Words, <HI>Recompence to no Man E|vil for Evil,</HI> they being our Saviour's Words, re|peated by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> with &s;ome little Variation in the Phra&s;e, tho' not in the Sen&s;e; what hath been advanc'd in An&s;wer to tho&s;e, will be a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to the&s;e. They are not addre&s;s'd to the Ma|gi&s;trate, who hath the &s;ole Right of making War. but to the injured Party; and therefore it cannot rea&s;onably be inferr'd from them, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> in|tended hereby to forbid all War under the Go&s;|pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. AND as to tho&s;e, <HI>v.</HI> 19, neither can any good Ar|gument be drawn from them again&s;t all Sorts of War; fora&s;much as &s;ome Sorts of War may be commenc'd without any De&s;ire of Revenge, but meerly from the Principle of Self-pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT that no conclu&s;ive Argument can be in|ferr'd from the&s;e Words again&s;t all War under the Go&s;pel, will farther appear from hence; that at the very Time when God appropriated to him&s;elf the Sword of Vengeance, &s;aying, Deut. xxxii. 35 <HI>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence,</HI> Laws were ac|tually in being for regulating and making War. And the <HI>Jews</HI> at the &s;ame Time that they were bound by the Law of God not to revenge them|&s;elves upon their Enemies, if Countrymen or Stran|gers, admitted to live among them becau&s;e Ven|geance belonged to God, and he had promis'd to recompence it might yet lawfully make War in &s;ome Ca&s;es, without a po&s;itive Command of God, as to this or that particular War; as is evident from the many Directions he had given them concerning this Matter, in the 20th Chapter of this &s;ame Book.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="006120_0046_1027EB9DCD2BBFF8">
St. PAUL therefore might enjoin Chri&s;tians not to revenge them&s;elves upon their Enerries (becau&s;e Vengeance belonged to God, and he would recom|pence it) as well as God had enjoin'd the <HI>Jews</HI> not to do &s;o, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, and yet not thereby intend to prohibit all Sorts of War under the Go&s;pel. For as God in &s;peaking the&s;e Words to the <HI>Jews,</HI> did not de&s;ign they &s;hould prohibit all Sorts of War among them, as appears by what has been &s;aid al|ready, and which St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and tho&s;e Chri&s;tians to whom he wrote, could not but know; &s;o if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had intended that this Precept &s;hould oblige them to any Thing farther than what he had oblig'd the <HI>Jews</HI> to, he &s;hould certainly have mentioned it. As the Words when &s;poken to the <HI>Jews,</HI> imply'd no|thing but a Prohibition of private Revenge, how could the Apo&s;tle imagine that the <HI>Romans</HI> could under&s;tand them as pror hiting all Sorts of War un|der the Go&s;pel, unle&s;s he had told them &s;o in expre&s;s Words?

<P>NOW in telling them that tho&s;e higher Powers are the Executioners of God's Wrath in puni&s;hing Evil-doers, he clearly di&s;tingui&s;hes between Re|venge in the Magi&s;trate, and Revenge in private Per&s;ons. The Magi&s;trate he owns is to be a Re|venger, that is, he is to execute Wrath, or inflict Puni&s;hment on them that do Evil, and that by Vir|tue of his Office, as he is Gold's Mini&s;ter, who&s;e a|lone Prerogative it is to recompence Vengeance on the Guilty; when at the &s;ame time he had expre&s;|ly prohibited it before, in the general Precept, <HI>A|venge not your&s;elves.</HI> Whence it plainly appears, that he did not intend by this Precept to prohibit Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates the U&s;e of the Sword to de|fend their Subjects from lawle&s;s Violence.</P>

<P>BUT, after all, I mu&s;t own my&s;elf at a Lo&s;s how to reconcile this &s;pecious Pretence with the general Doctrine the&s;e Men have delivered on this Point: For they have expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted in all their Writings on that Subject, that all bearing of Arms a|gain&s;t an Enemy, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Declaration to the King, <HI>Anno</HI> 1660.</NOTE>; nay, that all U&s;e of the Sword by Chri&s;tians, tho' to &s;ave them&s;elves from Thieves, Robbers or Cut-throats, is not only incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, but as bad as Athei&s;m, as being a di&s;tru&s;ting of Providence in re&s;training evil Men. Now, this being the Ca&s;e, I cannot &s;ee, and indeed he mu&s;t have good Eyes that can, how that can be lawful in the Chri&s;ti|an Magi&s;trate, which, by virtue of Chri&s;tianity, is not only unlawful in it&s;elf, but as bad as A|thei&s;m?</P>
<P>IF all War be unlawful under the Go&s;pel, by vir|tue of Chri&s;t's Command, as they &s;ay it is, it mu&s;t, in my humble Opinion, be a Sin in any Chri&s;tian, whether Magi&s;trate or Subject, to engage even in a Defen&s;ive War again&s;t a lawle&s;s Invader, unle&s;s it can be made appear that the Magi&s;trate is an Ex|ception
<PB N="33" REF="006120_0050_1027EBA8F2CF2FD8">from the general Rule. And be&s;ides, if it be not unlawful for the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate to de|fend his Subjects from lawle&s;s Violence, how can it be unlawful for tho&s;e Subjects to help to defend them&s;elves at their Magi&s;trate's Command? If the End be lawful, the ordinary Means for obtaining it mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e. Now, the ordinary Means whereby the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate can defend the Publick from Ruin again&s;t a foreign Enemy, is the mutual A&s;&s;i|&s;tance of his Subjects; it cannot therefore be unlaw|ful for Chri&s;tian Subjects to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Magi&s;trate in Defence of the Publick again&s;t a foreign Enemy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, p. 10, 11.</NOTE>: Nay, &s;o far is it from being unlawful, that it is their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, fora&s;much as they are obliged, by the Laws of Chri&s;tianity, to be &s;ubject to the higher Powers, and obey the Magi&s;trate, in all Things lawful; and what is lawful for him to com|mand, cannot be unlawful for the Subject to obey; &s;o that car Adver&s;aries, on this Point, mu&s;t either &s;hew where Chri&s;tianity has made War lawful for Chri&s;ti|an Magi&s;trates, while at the &s;ame time it has made War unlawful for Chri&s;tians; or el&s;e it will follow, from the whole Tenor of their Doctrine on this Point, that it is as unlawful for Magi&s;trates as for Subjects: But how this can be reconciled with their thinking it probable that God will ble&s;s their Arms with Succe&s;s, I own is more than I can ac|count for, with any Advantage to their Character.</P>
<P>AWAY then with that idle Di&s;tinction (to call it no wor&s;e) That tho' Chri&s;tians may not make u&s;e of carnal Weapons in their own nece&s;&s;ary Defence as Chri&s;tians, yet they may as Magi&s;trates. By this very Argument the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Antichri&s;t defends the Lawfulne&s;s of u&s;ing the temporal Sword to cut off Hereticks; which, whatever Weight it may have
<PB N="34" REF="006120_0051_1027EBAA818D3F50">with &s;ome People, it is &s;o far from having any with us, that we heartily abominate it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, If it be not unlawful for the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate to defend the Publick from the Violence of foreign Enemies, why do <HI>Quaker Magi&s;trates</HI> among us &s;o peremptorily refu&s;e to lend the lea&s;t As|si&s;tance towards it, when we apprehend our&s;elves in &s;o great Danger? They cannot be ignorant, that it is the Magi&s;trate's Duty to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Endea|vours for the Protection of the Subject from all lawle&s;s Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which in many Ca|&s;es cannot be done, without oppo&s;ing Force to Force by the carnal Sword. Now what can make them &s;o backward to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who are willing to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their Power in de|fending of their Country, but that they think the Practice is unlawful? How then can any one of that Per&s;ua&s;ion think it probable, that God will ble&s;s the Arms of their Sovereign, if it be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion to u&s;e them at all? And if it be not, how can they an&s;wer it to God and their own Con&s;ciences, who ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;e to do that which is their Duty to do, and with|out which, this Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, for any Thing they know to the contrary, may be quite ruined?</P>
<P>BUT here we &s;hall be told, that the Friends, tho' principled again&s;t bearing Arms them&s;elves, yet have never condemned &s;uch in the U&s;e of them, who are not convinc'd that the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel forbid them. The&s;e &s;mooth Words, in my Opinion, mean nothing at all. For if being charged with a Practice that is incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, nay with Athei&s;m, and a total Di&s;belief of Divine Providence, be not a very &s;evere Condemnation, I &s;ubmit to the unpre|judic'd Reader to judge. And that they have
<PB N="35" REF="006120_0052_1027EBAE71D391C8">done &s;o oftner than once, appears from the mo&s;t authentick of their own Writings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coll. of <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Works, Page 870. Declaration to the King, 1660. Tryals of <HI>George Keith.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR Principle is, that it is a Duty indi&s;pen&s;ibly incumbent, both on us and them, to defend our|&s;elves and Country from the lawle&s;s Attempts of a foreign Enemy by outward Means, at the &s;ame Time that we rely on Divine Providence for Pro|tection: And till they can prove the contrary from the New Te&s;tament, which I am confident they cannot, we cannot help thinking, that in condem|ning this Practice as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Religion, they condemn all who are in the U&s;e of it, notwith&s;tanding this &s;pecious Declaration to the contrary. We are not convinc'd that the Di&s;pen&s;ati|on of the Go&s;pel forbids any Chri&s;tian Community to defend them&s;elves from the Violence of a foreign Enemy; becau&s;e, as I have already &s;hewn, it is evi|dent almo&s;t to a Demon&s;tration, that there is no Ground for &s;uch a Conviction in the New Te&s;ta|ment; and therefore if our Adver&s;aries, on this Point, be &s;o convinced, it mu&s;t be by other Argu|ments than any that can be drawn from thence; which we looking upon as the only Rule of our Faith and Practice, think our&s;elves bound in Con|&s;cience to abide by it, and to be determined thereby, as to every Point of Duty. What it hath enjoin'd, we willingly ob&s;erve; and &s;uch Practices as were lawful before, and not made unlawful by it (there being an equal Nece&s;&s;ity for them now as before) we think we may lawfully, and with a good Con&s;ci|ence, embrace. This is our Rule, and our Practice in this Particular, we hope, is not contrary thereto. We are therefore determined to regard no private Spirit, under whatever &s;pecious Colours of Sanctity and Perfection it may appear; becau&s;e many lying Spirits are gone out into the World, and &s;uch we
<PB N="36" REF="006120_0053_1027EBB285AC9748">believe every Spirit to be, that attempts to make void the Law of Nature, introduce Principles as Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, which, in the pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances of the World, would &s;oon de&s;troy Chri&s;tianity, and bring all the Chri&s;tian States on Earth, into the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Slavery and Oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND thus I hope I have made it appear, to the Satisfaction of every unprejudic'd, intelligent Read|er, that it is not unlawful in all Ca&s;es for Chri&s;tians to make War under the Go&s;pel.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE On the LAWFULNESS of <HI>DEFENSIVE WAR.</HI> PART SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD now conclude, were it not that a certain Author, in a late Pamphlet, en|tituled, <HI>The Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, as held by the People colled</HI> Quakers, <HI>vindicated; in An|&s;wer to</HI> Gilbert Tennent<HI>'s Sermon on the Lawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War;</HI> hath undertaken to prove, by fair and candid Interpretations of Scripture, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, that War in any Shape (for &s;o he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean, if he means any thing) is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Religion. And becau&s;e &s;ome of his Remarks may &s;eem to affect the general Doctrine I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h in the Fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e, I think it my Duty, for the better Support thereof, to examine all &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as have the lea&s;t Tendency that Way.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of his Remarks that &s;eems to affect my Doctrine, is Page 3. in the&s;e Words, <Q>God created Man good, upright, and holy; and had he con|tinued in this State, there never would have been

Thus began &s;hedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the un|happy Con&s;equence of Sin. Nobody, &s;ays he, I hope, will &s;ay that God was the Author of Na|ture thus corrupted. The Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was the Author of, was holy, in|nocent, and perfect, but the Corruption of Na|ture, from whence proceeded Violence and Blood|&s;hed, was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan.</Q> An&s;wer,</P>
<P>THAT if Man had not fallen from his State of Innocence, there would have been no War, and con&s;equently no Need of Defence, every One will readily grant: But that immediately upon the Fall, Man's Nature was as highly corrupted, as this Vin|dicator repre&s;ents it, in my humble Opinion, wants Proof. For tho' it plea&s;ed God, for wi&s;e Ends, be&s;t known to him&s;elf, to permit Man to fall, yet he was &s;o far from abandoning him hereupon, that he takes Care to provide for his Happine&s;s, by entering into another Covenant with him, in the&s;e Words; <HI>The Seed of the Woman &s;hall brui&s;e the Head of the Serpent.</HI> 'Tis true Men being left to the Free|dom of their own Wills, &s;ome of them, no Doubt, made a bad U&s;e of their Liberty, and abandon'd them&s;elves to great Enormities; but it does not ap|pear that this was the Ca&s;e with all of them, or that it was a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the Fall, becau&s;e there were good Men notwith&s;tanding this, who did many Things agreeable to the Dictates of the Law of Nature; as <HI>Adam, Seth, Enos, Methu&s;alem, Noah;</HI> and it doth no where appear that tho&s;e Patriarchs had any other Rule whereby to guide their Practice, but this eternal Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; which is nothing
<PB N="39" REF="006120_0056_1027EBB98CF31810">el&s;e but the unchangeable Will of God, con&s;tantly acting according to the eternal Rules of infinite Goodne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, and Truth: Which Will of God, is engraven upon the Natures of Things, and to be di&s;covered by the due U&s;e of Mens rational Faculties. This Law hath God for its Author, was to have been the Rule of Duty in Paradi&s;e, and was &s;o to the Patriarchs till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Time, when God was plea&s;ed to make a particular Revelation of it to his cho&s;en People in the Decalogue; which is only a Tran&s;cript of this Law.</P>
<P>BUT to clear this Subject from the Rubbi&s;h of Words, under which this <HI>V.</HI> hath buried it, I will prove,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Exi&s;tence of the Law of Nature; and that it was the Rule of Duty, in ordinary Ca&s;es, to Mankind before the giving of the Law to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> And &s;econdly, That Man's Nature by the Fall was not &s;o corrupted, but that he could di&s;cern it to be &s;o, tho' he had not Power &s;ufficient to perform it in all Ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT there are natural, e&s;&s;ential Differences, in the Natures of Things, as between Truth and Fal&s;hood, Good-faith and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, Gratitude and Ingratitude, Love and Hatred, Ju&s;t and Un|ju&s;t, Right and Wrong, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And hence a Fitne&s;s and Unfitne&s;s in Actions to certain Ends, has ever been evident to the common Rea&s;on of Mankind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, Page 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE, and the like eternal Truths, con&s;idered as a Sy&s;tem of moral Principles, which have their Foundation in the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, are what we call the Law of Nature, Right Rea&s;on, the eternal Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the unchangea|ble Will of God, written in the Books of Nature. This is the immutable Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">d of moral Duty; whatever is agreeable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> morally Good, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Virtue and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are not meer arbitrary
<PB N="40" REF="006120_0057_1027EBBD555209D0">Things; what is morally fit and proper is virtuous; what is morally unfit and improper is vicious. And the &s;ame wi&s;e and good Being, who con&s;tituted Na|ture in &s;uch a Manner, that this Fitne&s;s or Unfit|ne&s;s &s;hould immediately re&s;ult from it, mu&s;t intend that every intelligent Being, &s;o far as he is capable of di&s;cerning the&s;e Things, &s;hould act agreeably thereto. This Law, we &s;ay, God is the Author of, becau&s;e tho&s;e moral Principles, which are founded in the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, were originally con|&s;tituted &s;uch by him, who is the Supream Author of Nature. This was <HI>Adam</HI>'s Law in Paradi&s;e, and continued to be a Law to Mankind, as far as we know, till the Time of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when a Tran&s;cript of it was delivered to him in the Mount. For tho' God made &s;ome &s;pecial Revelations to the Patri|archs, he never gave them any Sy&s;tem of Laws to be a Rule of Practice before this. And thus it ap|pears, that there exi&s;ts in Nature &s;uch a Law as we plead for</P>
<P>BUT by the Account the <HI>V.</HI> gives us of human Nature after the Fall, this Law was of no U&s;e to Mankind, becau&s;e they were uncapable of di&s;cover|ing what Duties were incumbent by virtue of it.</P>
<P>HE gives &s;uch a &s;trange De&s;cription of the Cor|ruption of Man's Nature, and the Depravation of his Faculties, as if he thought the Patriarchs neither had any Law to guide their Practice, nor were ca|pable of obeying it if they had. But how he came to di&s;cover &s;uch a total Depravation immediately up|on the Fall I know not. Certainly he never learnt it from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> For &s;o far as I can find there, what <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t by the Fall was Paradi&s;e, and the Tree of Life; <HI>i. e.</HI> in other Words, he lo&s;t Bli&s;s and Immortality. The Penalty annex'd to the Breach of the Law, with the Sentence pronounced by God upon it, &s;hews this. The Penalty &s;tands thus, <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 17. <HI>In the Day that thou eate&s;t there|of,
<PB N="41" REF="006120_0058_1027EBBEDF9933F0">of, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> How was this executed? He did eat, but in the Day he did eat, he did not actually die, but was turned out of Paradi&s;e from the Tree of Life, and &s;hut out forever from it, lea&s;t he &s;hould take thereof, and live forever. This &s;hews that Paradi&s;e was a State of Immortality, which he lo&s;t that very Day that he eat: His Life began from thence to &s;horten, and wa&s;te, and to have an End.</P>
<P>NOW is it at all likely, that as &s;oon as <HI>Adam</HI> was turn'd out of Paradi&s;e, his Faculties became &s;o de|praved, that he lo&s;t all Knowledge of that immuta|ble Rule of Duty, with which he mu&s;t have been perfectly well acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Paradi&s;e? 'Tis true his Po&s;terity, thro' Length of Time, became very de|bauch'd, both in Principle and Practice; but &s;till as there were many good Men, both before the Flood, and from thence to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Time, they mu&s;t have had &s;ome Law to be a Rule of Practice, and this Law they mu&s;t have been capable of know|ing, otherwi&s;e it could be no Rule to them, and con|&s;equently they could have been guilty of no Sin, be|cau&s;e where there is no Law, there can be no Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; and Sin is only a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a divine Law. And tho' a Law exi&s;ts, yet if it be impo&s;&s;i|ble for Men to come at the Knowledge of &s;uch a Law, 'tis all one, in regard to them, as if there were none; it being impo&s;&s;ible for them to obey a Law, the Knowledge of which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for them to come at.</P>
<P>BUT that Mankind, notwith&s;tanding the Corrup|tion of Nature this <HI>V.</HI> talks of, were not ignorant of the Law of Nature, nor altogether incapable of o|beying its Dictates, will farther appear from what follows.</P>
<P>THO' <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was the fir&s;t Man that had a written Law for a Rule of Practice, whence it is called, <HI>Lex Moralis,</HI> or the Law of Morals, yet they who
<PB N="42" REF="006120_0059_1027EBC18704F770">liv'd before <HI>Me&s;es</HI> were not without a Law, becau&s;e they had this moral Law written in their Hearts; <HI>i. e.</HI> by the due U&s;e of their rational Powers, they di&s;covered the Will of God concerning their moral Duty to be founded in the Natures and Rea&s;on of Things. The <HI>Centiles,</HI> both before and after <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es</HI> (as &s;aith St. <HI>Paul</HI>) doing by Nature, or finding it rea&s;onable to do the Things contained in the moral Law; the&s;e having not the moral Law written on Tables of Stone, were neverthele&s;s a Law unto them|&s;elves: What to do? Not what they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ed, not what their irregular Appetites prompted them to; but they were a Law unto them&s;elves, to do the Work of the Law of Nature, or the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Law written in their Hearts, in&s;tead of Tables of Stone. The Apo&s;tle, by a common F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, puts the Ef|fect of the Law for the Law it&s;elf, which indeed is equivalent thereto, as he &s;hews <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us; Their Con|&s;ciences bore Witne&s;s, and their Thoughts reflecting on their Actions, accu&s;ed, or excu&s;ed them in what they did.

<P>FROM all which it appears, that notwith&s;tanding the Corruption of Nature (this <HI>V.</HI> talks of) by the Fall, Mankind were not only &s;en&s;ible of the Obliga|tion of the Law of Nature, but, in all the principal Duties of Morality, were able to comply with it. And as all good Men were directed to their moral Duties by the Dictates of this Law, &s;o were they to that of a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence: For con&s;idering that the Pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves, and tho&s;e under their Care is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, they could not but conclude that Self-defence, when this can|not po&s;&s;ibly be done otherwi&s;e, mu&s;t be a Duty re|&s;ulting from this Law; it being an indi&s;putable Truth, that whenever it is our Duty to pro&s;ecute an End, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be our Duty to make U&s;e of tho&s;e Means, without which that End cannot be obtained. Hence all tho&s;e Wars which good Men undertook without any &s;pecial Command from God, were agreeable to this Law, as appears from their having been approved of by him after they were commenc'd. But having fully di&s;cours'd this Point in the fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e, I &s;hall now pro|ceed to an Examination of the <HI>V</HI>'s Rea&s;oning here, where perhaps we may di&s;cover &s;omething not much to the Credit of his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>HAVING fir&s;t repre&s;ented human Nature as fit for nothing but to be Fuel for the Fire of Hell, he adds, <Q>I hope Nobody will &s;ay, that God is the Author of Nature thus corrupted.</Q> In which Words he endeavours to delude his ignorant Read|er, by including a General in a Particular. He fir&s;t de&s;cribes Man's Nature as a meer Ma&s;s of Corrup|tion, and then, hoping his Reader would look no farther, he exults as if he had gain'd his Point; for he hopes no Body will &s;ay that God is the Au|thor of Nature thus corrupted. And tho' they do
<PB N="47" REF="006120_0064_1027EBCE8C7FF768">hot, his Argument will be never a Whit the more conclu&s;ive. Here then we have a Specimen of his Candour: For can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he is &s;o ig|norant as not to di&s;cern the Fallacy of his own Rea|&s;oning? I think not. Was all Nature comprehend|ed in the human Nature? The Nature of Man is, I hope, but a Part, a &s;mall incon&s;iderable Part of Nature; but can a Part contain the whole? Grant|ing human Nature was corrupted, doth it therefore follow, that all Nature mu&s;t be corrupted? Mu&s;t the Corruption of Man's Nature alter the Nature of Things, confound Right and Wrong, and take a|way all Di&s;tinction between moral Good and Evil? If not, then a Man may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that God is the Author of that Part of Nature which never was corrupted, and this is all we contend for. But we cannot help thinking, that God is the Author of that Part of Nature too which is thus corrupted, tho' not of the Corruption it&s;elf; which to deny, would incur &s;uch a Cen&s;ure as this <HI>V.</HI> I pre&s;ume, would not like. <Q>The Nature, &s;ays he, and the Light of Nature he was the Author of, was holy, innocent and perfect.</Q> Is not this an evident In|&s;inuation, that the Law or Light of Nature was corrupted by the Fall, as well as Man's Nature? That the eternal Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would have been the Rule of Man's Practice; had he kept his Innocency, was by the Fall de&s;troyed? His Words can be con&s;trued no otherwi&s;e than to import, that that Nature, and the Light of Nature, which was holy, innocent, and perfect, and of which God was the Author, was now no where exi&s;ting; whence he concludes, that Nature being univer&s;ally corrupted by the Fall, 'twas ab&s;urd in his Adver&s;ary to &s;peak of a Law or Light of Na|ture. If this be a wrong Con&s;truction of his Mean|ing, he mu&s;t blame him&s;elf, for his Words will ad|mit of no other.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="006120_0065_1027EBD16219C068">
BUT that Nature was univer&s;ally corrupted by the Fall, is an impious Fal&s;hood. For the natural and eternal Relations of Things, as Goodne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Love, Gratitude, good Faith, and the whole Sy&s;tem of moral Principles, which con|&s;titute that eternal Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, whereby every rational Being is bound by the very Con&s;titu|tion of his Nature to regulate his moral Actions (as I have &s;hewn already) is as holy, innocent, and perfect, &s;ince the Fall, as before. The Fallacy lies in the Word <HI>Nature,</HI> which he &s;hould have limited to the particular Nature he had been de&s;cribing; but this would not have &s;erv'd his Turn, <HI>viz.</HI> To prove there was no &s;uch Thing as the Law of Na|ture: And therefore like a true Sophi&s;t, he lays hold of the equivocal Term <HI>Nature,</HI> and after hav|ing de&s;crib'd one particular Species of Nature, and made it as black as Hell, he attributes to univer&s;al Nature, what he had de&s;cribed as peculiar to that particular Species; and &s;o thinks he has over&s;et his Adver&s;ary's Doctrine taken from the Law or Light of Nature.</P>
<P>THIS is ju&s;t &s;uch wretched Rea&s;oning, as if one &s;hould &s;ay, in Oppo&s;ition to another, maintaining, that Chri&s;t is the Author of the Catholick Church; <Q>The Catholick Church is &s;o mon&s;truou&s;ly corrup|ted, that &s;he is become a meer Chaos of Anti-Chri&s;tian Darkne&s;s (meaning the Church of <HI>Rome)</HI> will any one venture to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t is the Au|thor of the Catholick Church thus corrupted? The Catholick Church that Chri&s;t was the Author of, was holy, innocent, and pure.</Q> Now will any Man &s;ay, that this would be a good Argument again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of the Church of Chri&s;t? Becau&s;e a Part of the Catholick Church is degenerat|ed, doth it therefore follow, that the whole Com|pany of the Faithful are &s;o far degenerated, as that Chri&s;t hath now no Church upon Earth? And yet
<PB N="49" REF="006120_0066_1027EBD62B82DAE0">the Opponent by the equivocal Terms, <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> which, as apply'd by the Papi&s;ts, are &s;pe|cial, but as apply'd by other Chri&s;tians, are general, impo&s;es upon his Reader's A&s;&s;ent; that Chri&s;t can|not be the Author of the Catholick Church, and &s;o impo&s;es a Fal&s;hood upon them: Will any Man &s;ay, &s;ays the Opponent, that Chri&s;t is the Author of the Catholick Church thus corrupted? No; I believe no Man will &s;ay that Chri&s;t is the Author of the Corruption: But doth it therefore follow, that he is not the Author of the Catholick Church, which con&s;i&s;ts of the whole Company of the Faithful?</P>
<P>JUST &s;o is it, as to the Point in Debate; becau&s;e Man by the Fall corrupted his own Nature, doth it therefore follow, that the Law of Nature was cor|rupted? And becau&s;e God cannot be &s;aid to be the Author of the Corruption of Man's Nature, doth it therefore follow, that he cannot be &s;aid to be the Author of human Nature, and the Law of Nature? <Q>The Nature, and the Light of Nature, he was the Author of, was holy, innocent, and perfect; but the Corruption in Nature, from whence pro|ceeded Violence and Blood&s;hed, was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan,</Q> &s;ays the <HI>V.</HI> If by the Light of Nature he means the Law of Nature, as his Words nece&s;&s;arily import, I have made it appear to every unprejudiced Reader, that this Law is as holy, innocent, and perfect, as ever it was; as being nothing but the immutable Will of God him&s;elf, written in the great Books of Nature. And if by the Light of Nature he means tho&s;e ratio|nal Powers, whereby we di&s;cover this Will of God, and our Duty therein contained, I have &s;hewn likewi&s;e on this Head, that human Nature was not &s;o much depraved by the Fall, as thereby to render Men wholly uncapable to di&s;cover this Will of God concerning their Duty. And what follows doth not in the lea&s;t affect our Argument, becau&s;e we are not
<PB N="50" REF="006120_0067_1027EBD8D52B8E40">pleading for Violence and Blood&s;hed, but for a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Self-defence; and tho' it be true, that Vio|lence and Blood&s;hed proceeded from that Corruption of Nature which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, yet it will not follow, that nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence is &s;inful, more than it will follow, that becau&s;e the Nece&s;&s;ity of earning our Livelihood with the Sweat of our Brows, was occa&s;ioned by adher|ing to the Voice of Satan, therefore 'tis &s;inful to la|bour with our Hands the Things that are good, for the nece&s;&s;ary Support of our&s;elves and Families. If Violence and Blood&s;hed happen to en&s;ue upon a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Self-defence, this indeed proceeds from the Corruption of Nature occa&s;ionally, but not as a Cau&s;e: That the Corruption of Nature which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, was the Occa&s;ion of what Blood&s;hed and Violence might en&s;ue from a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence, I grant; be|cau&s;e if there had been no Corruption, there would have been no lawle&s;s Violence; and had there been no lawle&s;s Violence, there would have been no Need of Re&s;i&s;tance; and con&s;equently no Blood&s;hed and Violence en&s;uing from thence: But there is a wide Difference between a nece&s;&s;ary Effect, and an acci|dental Con&s;equence; between a Cau&s;e and an Occa|&s;ion. Sin is the Cau&s;e of our greate&s;t Sorrow, but it is only the Occa&s;ion of that godly Sorrow that worketh Repentance. The Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> was the Occa&s;ion of Chri&s;t's Sufferings; but it would be very ab&s;urd to &s;ay that this was the Cau&s;e of his Suf|ferings, whether efficient, in&s;trumental, or final. As ab&s;urd is it in this <HI>V.</HI> to in&s;inuate, that that Blood&s;hed and Violence which may accidentally en|&s;ue from a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence again&s;t lawle&s;s Vi|olence, hath that Corruption for its productive Cau&s;e, which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan. He may as well &s;ay, that tilling the Ground, and labouring for the Support of our&s;elves
<PB N="51" REF="006120_0068_1027EBDA77A796D0">and Families, proceeds from that Corruption which was occa&s;ion'd by adhering to the Voice of Satan as its productive Cau&s;e; for as the latter is only a Con&s;equence of that Corruption, &s;o is the former.</P>
<P>BUT, further, if all Blood&s;hed and Violence pro|ceed from that Corruption which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, as a productive Cau&s;e, and is therefore unlawful; what will this <HI>V.</HI> &s;ay to all the Blood&s;hed and Violence committed by the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate in the legal Puni&s;hment of Malefactors? Will he &s;ay that all this is unlawful, becau&s;e it proceeds from that Corruption of Nature which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan? And if he reply that this cannot be &s;aid, be|cau&s;e the Objects of &s;uch Violence have forfeited their Lives, by becoming Pe&s;ts to the Community where they live, and therefore may ju&s;tly be put to Death; &s;o &s;ay I with regard to that Violence that may en&s;ue upon a Community's defending them|&s;elves again&s;t a foreign Invader: The A&s;&s;ailants ha|ving violated the Laws of God and Nature, and put them&s;elves into a State of War with the Defen|dants, by attempting to de&s;troy them without any ju&s;t Provocation, have thereby forfeited their Lives to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as much as a Robber or Murdere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and therefore, by the Law of Nature, may be as ju&s;tly put to Death as the other, when the Defendants can by no other Means e&s;cape their Fu|ry. If the Violence practis'd by the Magi&s;trate then, upon notorious Offenders, be not unlawful, tho' it proceed from that Corruption of Nature which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan; neither is that which may en&s;ue upon a Nati|on's defending them&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e who have turn'd Rebels to God and Nature, unlawful, tho' it occa&s;ionally proceed from that Corruption of Nature which was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan, when they cannot e&s;cape their Violence by

Nor moreover do we allow the Point in Que&s;tion to be a Chri&s;tian Principle; &s;o far from it, that we have prov'd it to be a Prin|ciple of the Law of Nature; and that not from the degenerate fallen Light of Nature, as the <HI>V.</HI> loves to &s;peak, but from &s;elf-evident Propo&s;itions, and Facts recorded in Holy Writ <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See fir&s;t Part.</NOTE>.</P>

This whole Di&s;pen&s;ation was made up of Types and Shadows, whereof Chri&s;t was the Sub&s;tance; but when Chri&s;t came, the&s;e all nece&s;&s;arily vani&s;hed: <Q>The Nature being fini&s;hed, there was no farther Need of the rough Draught.</Q> But with relation to a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence, the Ca&s;e is very diffe|rent; if this was lawful under the Old Te&s;tament, by virtue of the Law of Nature (as I have proved it was) it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be lawful under the New; not only becau&s;e there is no Precept there prohibiting it, but becau&s;e the Grounds and Rea&s;ons thereof are the very &s;ame now they were then. Sacrifices and Circumci&s;ion are not to be u&s;ed now, becau&s;e there is no Occa&s;ion for them; but there is as great Occa|&s;ion for Defen&s;ive War as ever there was; &s;o that <Q>tis evident the Ca&s;es are not parallel. The <HI>V.</HI> adds, ut we are farther told, it is certain that God ap|proved of, and appointed his People to make War under the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and by the moral Law. The &s;ixth Commandment doth undoubtedly im|ply a lawful War; for if we mu&s;t not kill others, much le&s;s our&s;elves; and if we mu&s;t have no Hand in our own Death, we mu&s;t defend our
<PB N="54" REF="006120_0071_1027EBE1A2DB5AE8">Life again&s;t unju&s;t Violence, which &s;ometimes can|not be done without War. Now the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us never came to de&s;troy the moral Law of Nature, but to fulfil it.</Q> To which he replies, <Q>A po&s;i|tive Precept is made to imply its direct Rever&s;e; A Command not to kill, is implied to authorize killing.</Q> Here we have another Specimen of his Learning and Candour. In the fir&s;t Place he &s;peaks Non&s;en&s;e in Grammar; and in the &s;econd he gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ents his Adver&s;ary, and abu&s;es his Reader, by putting &s;uch a Con&s;truction on his Words, as they will by no Means admit of. He has no where &s;aid, that a Command not to kill, is implied to au|thorize Killing; nor can any Thing like it be fairly inferred from his Words. This is a forced and fal&s;e Con&s;truction, of the <HI>V</HI>'s own framing; and if it is an Ab&s;urdity, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>HIS Adver&s;ary, I dare &s;ay, never imagined that the &s;ixth Commandment forbids all Killing, but on|ly all Killing that is Murder. And if he thinks &s;o, what Opinion mu&s;t he have of Magi&s;trates, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e of his own Friends, who make no more Scruple to kill in their Way than others do? In or|der therefore to do Ju&s;tice to his Adver&s;ary, he ought to have put his Words in their true Light, and then they would have run thus; As the Sixth Commandment forbids Murder, it nece&s;&s;arily im|plies an Authority or Right to kill in a lawful War. And this is &s;o far from being an Ab&s;urdity, that I hope it will appear to be an evident Truth. That the Sixth Commandment implies a Defen&s;ive War (and the Author of the Sermon meant no other) I prove thus;</P>
<P>IF by Virtue of this Command it be a Sin to de|&s;troy my&s;elf, it mu&s;t by the Terms be a Duty to pre&s;erve my&s;elf; and if it be my Duty to pre&s;erve my&s;elf, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be my Duty to defend my|&s;elf again&s;t lawle&s;s Violence, when I cannot &s;ecure
<PB N="55" REF="006120_0072_1027EBE46D67A070">my own Pre&s;ervation otherwi&s;e; and if it be my Duty to defend my&s;elf again&s;t lawle&s;s Violence, when I cannot &s;ecure my own Pre&s;ervation other|wi&s;e, it mu&s;t be my Duty to do it by &s;uch Means, and in &s;uch a Manner, as without which I cannot po&s;&s;ibly effect it; and if I cannot po&s;&s;ibly effect it without Defen&s;ive War, it cannot be unlawful to engage in it. But to bring the Argument clo&s;er &s;till; If by Virtue of this Command, it be a Sin for the Magi&s;trate to de&s;troy his Subjects, it mu&s;t by the Terms, as well as by Virtue of his Office, be his Duty to protect them; and if it be his Duty to pro|tect them, it mu&s;t be his Duty to defend them a|gain&s;t all Inju&s;tice and Wrong; and if it be his Du|ty to defend them again&s;t all Inju&s;tice and Wrong, it mu&s;t be his Duty to do it by &s;uch Means, and in &s;uch a Manner, as without which it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be done; and if it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be done without oppo&s;ing Force to Force, in the U&s;e of carnal Wea|pons, it cannot be unlawful in him to u&s;e the&s;e Means. Nay &s;o far is it from being unlawful, that by Virtue of this Command, it mu&s;t be his indi&s;pen|&s;ible Duty to u&s;e &s;uch Means, when the Pre&s;ervati|on of his innocent Subjects cannot be &s;ecured with|out them. Every Magi&s;trate then being bound by virtue of this Command, not only to ab&s;tain from murdering his Subjects, but to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means for pre&s;erving their Lives, Liberties, and Proper|ties; he is likewi&s;e bound by virtue of this Com|mand to engage in a Defen&s;ive War, when this is the only Mean left in his Power for effecting the&s;e valuable Purpo&s;es; unle&s;s it can be made appear that &s;uch a War is expre&s;ly prohibited by a Go&s;pel Precept; which, as I have &s;hewn above, cannot be done. From all which we conclude that the Sixth Commandment doth undoubtedly imply Defen&s;ive War.</P>

<P>The <HI>V.</HI> farther adds, <Q>Now (&s;aith the Sermon) if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is &s;till the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of it under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation as before, it will follow that it is equally lawful now.

<P>Suppo&s;e the Vindicator were to argue in Defence of Divine Revelation, thus; If God Almighty ap|prov'd of Revelation formerly, and there is &s;till the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of it now, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now. And &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome one &s;hould reply, this Manner of arguing proves <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> as lawful as Chri&s;tianity: God commanded the <HI>Jews</HI> to keep Fa&s;ts, and ob&s;erve Holy-days, to offer Sa|crifices, and wor&s;hip in the Temple; is it therefore equally lawful to do &s;o now, whether we have God's Command or not? How would the <HI>V.</HI> like this Manner of arguing? Would he allow that the Argument (proving Divine Revelation to be lawful now, from the Divine Approbation of it formerly) proves <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> as lawful as Chri&s;tianity?

<PB N="61" REF="006120_0078_1027EBF5CA0195A0">Meetings?

<P>THE Author's Argument being thus clear'd from the <HI>V</HI>'s fal&s;e Repre&s;entation, the in&s;ulting Que&s;tion, <HI>Is it therefore equally lawful to do &s;o now, whether we have his Command or not?</HI> which he propo&s;es with &s;uch an Air of Victory, &s;hamefully recoils upon him&s;elf, as being no ways inferrable from the Argu|ment of his Adver&s;ary, but is the meer Creature of his own Invention.</P>

Things which are morally Evil (and &s;uch are all Things contrary to the Law of Nature) can never be an Object of Di|vine Approbation, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be condem|ned by him; the eternal and nece&s;&s;ary Rectitude of his Nature requires it. The&s;e Wars were Defen&s;ive, or <HI>Tantamount,</HI> as I ob&s;erved above; the latter was undertaken by the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to defend them&s;elves from the Violence of an Enemy, that by Force of Arms oppos'd their Pa&s;&s;age into their own Land; the former was undertaken by <HI>Abraham,</HI> to recover his di&s;tre&s;s'd Friend and Kin&s;man, and his mi&s;erable Family, from a lawle&s;s Enemy, that had taken them Captives. Now if &s;uch a War was lawful then (as appears it was) there being the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity &s;till for Self-defence, it will follow, that Self-defence is equally lawful now, unle&s;s a Law of the Go&s;pel can be produc'd which expre&s;ly forbids it.</P>
<P>THERE IS a manife&s;t Difference between God's ap|proving tho&s;e Wars that were undertaken by good Men, having no other Warrant for &s;o doing than
<PB N="65" REF="006120_0082_1027EC0079FCFC68">the bare Law of Nature; and tho&s;e that were un|dertaken by his &s;pecial Command. The fir&s;t were undertaken becau&s;e they were agreeable to the Law of Nature, antecedent to all po&s;itive Precepts what&s;oever, and therefore were approved of by God; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tter were only lawful becau&s;e God commanded them. He being the ab&s;olute Sove|reign of the Univer&s;e, and the rightful Proprietor of all his Creatures, may ju&s;tly di&s;po&s;e of them to whom, and in what Manner, he plea&s;es. 'Tis true God cannot di&s;&s;olve the Obligation of the preceptive Law of Nature, or change the Natures of Good and Evil. For altho' he be omnipotent, yet we mu&s;t always &s;uppo&s;e his infinite Power to be conjoin'd with infinite Goodne&s;s, el&s;e it is no Divine Power; and therefore, <HI>Po&s;&s;e malum, non e&s;t po&s;&s;e; i. e.</HI> It is no Power but Weakne&s;s to do Evil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, Page 7.</NOTE>. Neverthele&s;s, God may alter the Properties of tho&s;e Things from whence the Re&s;pects of Good and Evil do re&s;ult, as in the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> de&s;troying &s;ome Nations utterly, and taking away their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which God may ju&s;tly do, by virtue of his ab&s;olute Dominion; but the Change here is not in the Obligation of the Law, but in the Things them&s;elves. Murder would be an intrin&s;ical Evil &s;till, but that which was done by an immediate and explicit Command from God, was no Murder. Robbery had been a Sin &s;till, but taking Things alienated from their Properties by God him&s;elf, was not Robbery. And moreover, the Nations upon whom he commanded the <HI>I&s;ra|elites</HI> to make War, and de&s;troy &s;ome of them utter|ly, and &s;poil them of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, had by their Wickedne&s;s forfeited all to the Sovereign Proprietor of the whole World; who might therefore ju&s;tly take them away by whatever In&s;truments he plea&s;ed; and as he thought proper to make U&s;e of the <HI>I&s;ra|elites</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, they did no Wrong in taking away their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and de&s;troying many of them

<P>He further adds, <Q>The latter Part of the Para|graph does not belong to the Argument, unle&s;s it is fir&s;t prov'd, either that People Now-a-days have the expre&s;s Command of God to go to War:&mdash; Or that he hath determined Man to be a &s;ufficient Judge when it is &s;uitable, and when not.</Q></P>
<P>TO which I reply: The fir&s;t Part of this Re|mark is fal&s;e, as &s;ufficiently appears from what I have &s;aid above; and the latter Part is already an&s;wered. For I have prov'd, to the Conviction of every un|prejudic'd Reader, that Defen&s;ive War is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and not contrary to the Go&s;pel, notwith&s;tanding the want of an expre&s;s Command of God.

<P>THE Author of the Sermon &s;ays farther; <Q>Can we think that God would approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the moral Law?

That the Go&s;pel prohibits all unlaw|ful Wars, as it does all other unlawful Actions, we readily grant; but it no more follows from hence, that all Manner of War is unlawful under the Go&s;|pel, than that all Manner of Actions are &s;o; for as &s;ome Actions are lawful, notwith&s;tanding there are a great many unlawful; &s;o &s;ome Wars may be ju&s;t, not with&s;tanding the many unju&s;t Wars that are car|ried on in the World; and tho' the&s;e be prohibited by the Go&s;pel, as all other unju&s;t Actions are, yet it does not appear that tho&s;e are prohibited any farther, than as they exceed the Bounds of Ju&s;tice and Hu|manity; and then 'tis only the Abu&s;e that is prohi|bited, but not the U&s;e. <Q>The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us (&s;aith the <HI>V.</HI>) hath taught &s;ome Chri&s;tians, both by the immediate Dictates of his Spirit, and Expre&s;&s;ion of his Will, when per&s;onally upon Earth, that the be&s;t Way to keep the Commandments, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> and, <HI>Thou &s;hall love thy Neighbour,</HI> is not to harbour any Ill-will or Revenge again&s;t any, but to love Enemies.</Q> I will add, by way of Remark, That the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us hath taught, not &s;ome, but all Chri&s;tians, I &s;hall not &s;ay, by the im|mediate

And, without Doubt, all who de&s;erve the Name of Chri&s;tians, will acknowledge this, as well as this <HI>V.</HI> and, I doubt not, are as ready to practi&s;e it in its true and proper Sen&s;e. But how does this Argument prove the Unlawfulne&s;s of Self-defence again&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of a foreign Enemy? Becau&s;e it is every Chri&s;tian's Duty to harbour no Ill-will or Revenge again&s;t any, doth it therefore follow, that it is the Duty of the Magi&s;trate to &s;uffer a foreign Invader to de&s;troy him&s;elf and his Subjects, without any Re&s;i&s;tance? Or, in other Words, That 'tis unlaw|ful for the Magi&s;trate to defend him&s;elf, and his Subjects, again&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of a foreign Enemy? By the &s;ame Argument, he ought to bear with the mo&s;t villainous Outrages of Cut-throats and Rebels among his own Subjects, becau&s;e this will be the be&s;t Way to keep the Commandments, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> and, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour,</HI> by not harbouring any Ill-will or Revenge a|gain&s;t any, but loving of Enemies. But may not the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate defend him&s;elf and his Sub|jects again&s;t a foreign Enemy, without harbouring Ill-will and Revenge again&s;t any, as well as put to Death a notorious Criminal, who cannot be pre|&s;erv'd without manife&s;t Danger to the Community? And if &s;o, why &s;uch a mighty Out cry again&s;t a Defen&s;ive War, as if it could not be undertaken without the manife&s;t Violation of the Sixth Com|mandment, and the Precept of Chri&s;t, to harbour no Ill-will or Revenge again&s;t any, but to love E|nemies, when 'tis evident the Ca&s;e is quite other|wi&s;e?
<PB N="71" REF="006120_0088_1027EC105010E658">For if the Magi&s;trate may put to Death a notorious Malefactor, who cannot be pre&s;erv'd without manife&s;t Danger to the Publick, and yet not be chargeable with any Violation of the&s;e Com|mandments, he may likewi&s;e, without being guilty of any Violation of the&s;e Commandments, &s;trenu|ou&s;ly defend him&s;elf and his innocent Subjects a|gain&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of a foreign Invader, when the Ruin of the Publick cannot be prevented without it. This <HI>V.</HI> &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between War Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive (but this would have di&s;&s;erv'd his Purpo&s;e) and even between the U&s;e and the Abu&s;e of the latter. I acknowledge that even a Defen&s;ive War may be abus'd, when Men, in the Management of it, exceed the Bounds of Ju&s;tice and Humanity; but this is no Argument again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of it, but only of the Perver&s;ene&s;s of Mankind, who are too apt to abu&s;e the be&s;t Things of Providence. Chri&s;tianity has been abus'd by bad Men to very ill Purpo&s;es, and yet I hope Nobody will &s;ay, that therefore the Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity is unlawful. Chri&s;tianity forbids Injury and Re|venge, and enjoins the Love of Enemies (&s;ays the <HI>V.</HI>) and therefore 'tis unlawful for Chri&s;tians to de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t a foreign Enemy. Now the &s;ame Argument will prove it unlawful for the Chri|&s;tian Magi&s;trate to re&s;i&s;t a dome&s;tick Traitor, or the mo&s;t outrageous Villain what&s;oever; for if Re&s;i|&s;tance to them can be managed wholly without the&s;e Crimes, and con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;t's Precept of lov|ing Enemies, &s;o may likewi&s;e Re&s;i&s;tance to a foreign Enemy. If it cannot, and yet Re&s;i&s;tance to them be acknowledged lawful, &s;o likewi&s;e may Re&s;i&s;tance to foreign Invaders, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame Un|happine&s;s. Let them look to it who are guilty of the&s;e Crimes. This can no more hinder hone&s;t Men from defending them&s;elves, or from making their Advantages of the Crimes of others in their
<PB N="72" REF="006120_0089_1027EC120A69C198">own Self-defence in one Ca&s;e, than it is allowed to do in another.</P>
<P>BUT it is a very unaccountable Thing, in my Opini|on, to &s;uppo&s;e that a People cannot join together, with the Con&s;ent, and by the Authority of the &s;u|pream Magi&s;trate, in defending them&s;elves again&s;t a foreign Enemy, without any &s;uch Crimes. For there is nothing nece&s;&s;ary to this, that I know of, that requires either Revenge, Hatred, or Injury, in the true Sen&s;e of the&s;e Terms, or any Thing but an inoffen&s;ive and ju&s;tifiable Way of proceeding. If any other Methods have been u&s;ed in carrying on &s;uch Wars, this will only reflect upon the Per&s;ons who have made U&s;e of them, not upon the Ju&s;tice of the Wars them&s;elves. Hence will appear the Impertinency of this <HI>V</HI>'s elaborate Harangue, Page 39. where he &s;ays, <Q>If every particular Member of the Church be forbidden Revenge, it is becau&s;e allowing of it would manife&s;t a want of Patience and Fortitude to endure, and encourage Envy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;urely then this Rea&s;on is much &s;tronger for forbidding national and publick Revenge.</Q> All which is <HI>gratis dictum</HI> &s;till, becau&s;e the Practice, for the Lawfulne&s;s of which we are contending, implies no &s;uch Idea. We grant that the Go&s;pel forbids Revenge, both private and publick; Doth it there|fore follow, that it forbids Self-defence? Or, in other Words, doth it therefore follow, that a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence is unlawful, when this can be done without Revenge? Let this <HI>V.</HI> prove, that an affectionate Father cannot defend him|&s;elf again&s;t an unnatural Child attempting to cut his Throat, without Revenge; or that a pious Prince cannot defend his innocent Subjects from a foreign Invader, without a malicious Inten|tion of Revenge and Injury in the proper Sen&s;e of the&s;e Terms; and then his Argument will &s;ignify &s;omething, otherwi&s;e 'tis quite impertinent, and wholly
<PB N="73" REF="006120_0090_1027EC16D53B9F88">foreign to the Point in debate. But then he tells us further: <Q>A Prohibition of Injuries, and a Com|mand to endure them, mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as re|lative to the Con&s;equence if allow'd: A &s;mall In|jury is attended with a Degree of Inju&s;tice, and the enduring it rather than returning it, &s;hews, in &s;ome Degree, a Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition. Now con|&s;ider that Con&s;equence with re&s;pect to greater, the enduring of them, rather than returning Evil for Evil, doth certainly &s;hew a greater Degree of that Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s of Heart, which Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples to learn of him.</Q> Up|on which I mu&s;t remark, in the fir&s;t Place, That this &s;ophi&s;tical Argument reflects a mo&s;t egregious Calumny on the Chri&s;tian Religion, repre&s;enting it as nece&s;&s;arily laying Chri&s;tians open to all the villain|ous Outrages the vile&s;t Part of Mankind think fit to offer them. For by the &s;ame Argument it may be prov'd unlawful to re&s;i&s;t a Robber or a Cut|throat, becau&s;e the enduring of their injurious Treatment, rather than returning Evil for Evil, &s;hews a Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition, and a very great De|gree of that Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s of Heart, which Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples to learn of him. By the &s;ame Argument it may be prov'd unlawful for a Chri&s;tian Prince to quell a dangerous Con&s;pi|racy, or to re&s;i&s;t a Cabal of rebellious Subjects, who have &s;worn De&s;truction to him and the Common|wealth, becau&s;e the enduring &s;uch Injury and Inju|&s;tice, rather than returning Evil for Evil, &s;hews a Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition in him, and a great Degree of that Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s of Heart, which Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples to learn of him. And if it be &s;aid that the Chri&s;tian Religion allows the Ma|gi&s;trate to regard the publick Good, then it mu&s;t con&s;equently be allowed lawful for him to defend the Publick from lawle&s;s Violence; unle&s;s a Regard for the publick Good can be con&s;i&s;tent with the De|&s;truction
<PB N="74" REF="006120_0091_1027D91B9E4592A0">of the Publick. But the true State of this Ca&s;e, in &s;hort, can amount to no more than this, that Chri&s;tianity obliges Men to &s;uffer pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly, when they cannot by any lawful M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans prevent it. The Point therefore this <HI>V.</HI> mu&s;t prove, is this; That Self-defence again&s;t a foreign Invader, when other Methods fail, is an unlawful Method for People to take in or|der to prevent their own Ruin. Or, that tho' the Chri&s;tian Religion hath allowed the Chri&s;tian Ma|gi&s;trate to defend him&s;elf and his innocent Subjects from Robbers and Cut-throats in private Ca&s;es, it hath ab&s;olutely condemned it in all Ca&s;es again&s;t a foreign Invader, tho' this be much more nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ame good End. To prove this, would do Service to a Cau&s;e which I hope the <HI>V.</HI> hath not much at Heart, but would by no Means be for the Honour of the Chri&s;tian Rengion. But to tell us that Chri&s;tianity obliges us to bear Injuries, can be no Argument at all again&s;t our Doctrine; we are as ready to acknowledge this as this <HI>V.</HI> The Que&s;tion is, how far it obliges us to do &s;o? And that every Man, who hath not renounced his Rea&s;on, or ma&s;k'd it with a Vizor of Hypocri&s;y, will own, is no farther than they cannot prevent it by lawful and honourable Means. And if it can be &s;hewn, that Self-defence in all Ca&s;es is condemn'd in the Go&s;pel, this mu&s;t be the Argument again&s;t it taken from Chri&s;tianity, and not that it obliges us to bear Inju|ries; for this it may do, and yet allow of Self-de|fence, in Ca&s;es of publick Concern, as well as in &s;ome Ca&s;es of private Concern.</P>
<P>AS to the Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture from whence the <HI>V.</HI> infers his Argument, I have &s;ufficiently examin|ed them in the fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e, and &s;hewn, that they nece&s;&s;arily require a Limitation, and that it can be no more &s;hewn from tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, that no Ca&s;es are to be excepted in the interpreting the&s;e Texts, than it can be from the like general

<P>We are forbid in unlimited Terms to re&s;i&s;t Evil, but no where forbid to defend our&s;elves; we are en|joined in unlimited Terms to love our Enemies, but this cannot imply a total Neglect of our&s;elves; we are required likewi&s;e in unlimited Terms to pray for our Enemies, but this doth not im|ply that we are to pray in an unlimited Manner for them, any more than our Obligation to return them Ble&s;&s;ing for Cur&s;ing implies in it a Nece&s;&s;ity of pray|ing for their worldly Pro&s;perity to our own De&s;truc|tion. We are required in general Terms to pray for all Men, but we are left to common Sen&s;e to in|form us that Charity begins at Home, and that we are not obliged to pray for their Succe&s;s or Life, if it be incon&s;i&s;tent with our own, or to prefer the temporal Good of any Per&s;on, before the Happine&s;s of others in whom we are more nearly concerned.</P>

<P>BUT further, the Argument again&s;t Self-defence taken from the&s;e Words, <HI>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</HI> is not only inconclu|&s;ive, but ill grounded; and is &s;o far from being in &s;avour of the <HI>V.</HI> that it makes directly again&s;t him.

And Chri&s;t him&s;elf being provok'd by the Ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>Jews,</HI> is &s;aid by a Parable, to &s;end out his Army, and to burn up their City, which was accordingly fulfilled in Fact. So that tho' it be the Duty of Chri&s;tians not to re|taliate Injury and Revenge, that they may be the Children of their heavenly Father, who is good to the Unthankful and the Wicked, it will not follow that 'tis unlawful for the Magi&s;trate (who is God's Mini&s;ter to execute Vengeance, or inflict Puni&s;h|ment on them that do Evil) to defend with the Sword of Ju&s;tice his Innocent Subjects again&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence of wicked Men; becau&s;e at the &s;ame Time that he doth this, he may imitate his heavenly Father, who tho' he be kind to the Un|thankful and Wicked, yet declares his Indignation and Wrath again&s;t ob&s;tinate Sinners, both in this Life and the next.

<P>THE Practice therefore we plead for, being the Act of the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, comes up to the Almighty's univer&s;al Beneficence as a Compari&s;on; who, notwith&s;tanding this, doth by no Means clear the Guilty: And thus it appears that the <HI>V</HI>'s Con|clu&s;ion is as fal&s;e, as his Premi&s;es are impertinent.</P>
<P>Again: The Author of the Sermon endeavours to prove, that the Office of the Magi&s;trate nece&s;&s;a|rily evinces the Lawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War; up|on which the <HI>V.</HI> makes this Remark; <Q>Whenever the Magi&s;trate is convinced that the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to tho&s;e Doctrines;</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> in other Words, to act ac|cording to his Convictions. To which I reply: I &s;eems very unaccountable how any Man can be con|vinced that 'tis lawful to be a Magi&s;trate, who is the &s;ame time convinced of the Unlawfulne&s;s of De|fen&s;ive War. For if it be the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of the Magi&s;trate to protect the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, and if this cannot, at &s;ome times, be done, without oppo&s;ing Force to Force, I would a&s;k this <HI>V.</HI> How that Man can be &s;aid to do his Duty, or act a con&s;i&s;tent Part, who, undertaking the Office of a Magi&s;trate, is bound in Con&s;cience to deny that to the Publick, which at Times is the mo&s;t valuable and nece&s;&s;ary End of his Office? He mu&s;t either allow, that it is not the Magi&s;trate's Duty to protect the Lives and Liberties of Sub|jects from unju&s;t Violence, which I believe he will hardly venture to do; or el&s;e, that every Man, prin|cipled again&s;t Self-defence, undertaking the Office of a Magi&s;trate, acts &s;uch a Part as no hone&s;t Man can ju&s;tify. The <HI>V.</HI> &s;hould have &s;aid, which would

<P>But further: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, Page 11.</NOTE> I look upon it to be a prepo&s;terous Way of arguing, that becau&s;e a Man is not con|vinced of the Lawfulne&s;s of any Practice evidently requi&s;ite for the Good of human Society, that there|fore it is his Duty to omit it; this is making a Man's Faith or Per&s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion the Rule of moral Duties. 'Tis true the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>What&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin;</HI> but he doth not mean tho&s;e moral Duties which are di&s;coverable by the meane&s;t Mortal, that has the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on; but &s;uch as ari&s;e from doubtful Speculations, the Practice or Omi&s;&s;ion whereof, hath no other Evil in them, than as they give Scandal or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ence to weak Brethren.

'Tis a Duty, the Obligation to which no Law can di&s;pen&s;e with, nor can any Pre|tence

And even as to Ca&s;es of Omi&s;&s;ion, if a Subject under&s;tands it to be his Duty not to obey the lawful Commands of the &s;upream or &s;overeign Power of the Commonwealth, will he therefore incur no Guilt, when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>That he &s;hall thereby receive to him&s;elf Damna|tion?</HI> If a Chri&s;tian under&s;tands it to be his Duty, from &s;ome mi&s;taken Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, not to la|bour for the Meat that peri&s;heth, and thereby &s;tarve him&s;elf and his Family, will he therefore incur no Guilt?

<P>IF the Magi&s;trate, the very End of who&s;e Office it is to pre&s;erve and protect Mens Lives and Proper|ties, under&s;tands it to be his Duty not to inflict Pu|ni&s;hment on Evil-doers, notwith&s;tanding this be in|di&s;pen&s;ibly

When Nation &s;hall cea&s;e to lift up Sword again&s;t Nation, and not learn War any more; then I own Chri&s;tians may convert their Weapons of War into Implements of Hu&s;ban|dry; but till then it doth not appear, from any thing in this Prophe&s;y, that they may not lawfully keep them, and u&s;e them too, provided it be pure|ly in their own Defence. Nothing from thence can be concluded again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of a nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence, &s;o long as they that heartily endea|vour to live in Peace, are not &s;uffered to enjoy in What the <HI>V.</HI> quotes from the learned <HI>Pocie,</HI> is &s;o fat from making it appear that this Prophe&s;y makes in favour of his Argument, that it is a &s;trong Confir|mation of what I have advanced, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Completion of this Prophe&s;y is yet to come. The Animo&s;ities and Ho&s;tilities between the <HI>Jews</HI> and Gentiles have never yet been rooted out; this will never be till the <HI>Jews</HI> are converted; nor have Mens Pride, and Pa&s;&s;ions, and Lu&s;ts, which are the Cau&s;es of all Wars, been &s;ubdued, as this learned Commentator &s;ays they &s;hall be, when this Prophe&s;y &s;hall be fulfilled. And when he &s;ays, that the working Humility, Meekne&s;s, Self-denial, and true and fer|vent Love to all Men, from whence Peace nece&s;&s;arily follows, was the De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel in all, and the Effect of it in tho&s;e that rightly received it; this no more proves that he thought this Prophe&s;y makes Defen&s;ive War unlawful under the Go&s;pel, than that he thought it makes capital Puni&s;hments by the Magi&s;trate &s;o.

<P>BUT further, if the&s;e antient Fathers did any where affirm this Prophe&s;y to be fulfilled in the Cri|&s;tians in their Times, they could mean no more, than that it was fulfilled &s;o far as that Chri&s;tians liv'd more peaceably than the Heathens; no more, than that it it was fulfilled in &s;ome Sen&s;e, as we &s;ay;

And if <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> took the holy Mountain in this Prophe&s;y to be &s;poken of the Church of Chri&s;t, as the <HI>V.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, and if he tho't that this would be the State of the Church in every Period of it, we mu&s;t beg Leave to think he was mi&s;taken; for 'tis evident from Fact, that the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e.

Fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that they being Subjects under their Magi&s;trates, which their Religion taught them to regard as an Ordinance of God, had no Right to re&s;i&s;t any Vio|lence offered by them, as they were but private Sub|jects; becau&s;e in &s;o doing, they would have been Rebels, and &s;o would have incurr'd the Penalty of Damnation. A particular Party of Men may be barbarou&s;ly us'd by their Superiors, and yet it may neither be expedient nor lawful for them to defend them&s;elves by Force of Arms, becau&s;e the Laws of the Community are again&s;t them; and as they can|not in Con&s;cience comply with the&s;e Laws, whatever Rea&s;on they may have to lament their Misfortune, they can have none to complain of being obliged to &s;uffer the Penalty, in Ca&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. For every Per&s;on that &s;ubmits to a Government, and becomes a Subject to any Prince, either explicitly or implicitly, &s;tipulates and con&s;ents, that he will pay due Obedience to all the Laws of the Common-Wealth to which he belongs; which Obedience is ju&s;tly due from him to the Government, for the Protection it affords him, and the Privileges he en|joys under it. Now if any Subject, under &s;uch O|bligations, &s;hould find him&s;elf oblig'd in Con&s;cience to alter his Conduct, whereby he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es &s;ome &s;tanding Law of the Community; if in this Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, he is made to &s;uffer the Penalty in Ca&s;e of &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, it is no more than he had Rea&s;on to expect, becau&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have promis'd O|bedience to whatever Laws &s;hould be made by the Legi&s;lature of that Government to which he hath &s;ubmitted; and to attempt to defend him&s;elf by Force of Arms again&s;t the Execution of the Laws of this Government, would be no le&s;s than Rebellion. Wherefore the only lawful Reme|dy left him in this Ca&s;e, is Patience, and Meekne&s;s,
<PB N="91" REF="006120_0108_1027EC48E790BD08">under his Sufferings. Now this was the Ca&s;e of the primitive Chri&s;tians. They were a Party of Men barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed, and they had, no doubt, a Right to better Treatment; but no one can &s;hew, either that they could ju&s;tly complain of the Executi|on of the Laws, unle&s;s it can be made appear, that their Superiors were convinc'd that they had a divine Commi&s;&s;ion for what they did contrary to tho&s;e Laws; or (which is a Con&s;ideration of great Weight in this Debate) that it would have been for the Intere&s;t and good of the Publick, or whole Community, that they &s;hould have ri&s;en up in Arms, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for their own particular Self-de|fence again&s;t their Superiors and Fellow Subjects, have put who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Nations in Combu&s;tion, and &s;o have been the Occa&s;ion of great and univer&s;al Calamities. Every Body can &s;ee at once the infinite Difference between the Ca&s;e of the primitive Chri&s;tians, who were puni&s;hed by their own Magi&s;trates, becau&s;e they could not in Con&s;cience obey the Laws of their Country, and that of one Nation's invading ano|ther. Be&s;ides, it was very much for the Honour and Propagation of their Religion, whil&s;t they were but a Party of Subjects, not concerned in the Ma|nagement of State-Affairs, that they &s;hould engage the Favour of their Princes, and attract the Hearts of all Men to their Profe&s;&s;ion, by their &s;ignal Pa|tience, and Submi&s;&s;ion to the greate&s;t Torments i|maginable. But it mu&s;t be extremely to the Di&s;|grace and Hindrance of their Religion, if it obli|ged them, when they became the whole of a Com|munity, govern'd by their own Laws, to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to be ruined and made mi&s;erable by eve|ry lawle&s;s, foreign Invader. By the former they de|mon&s;trated to all the World the Power of their Faith, in Ca&s;es in which it was lawful and honoura|ble for them to &s;uffer, and to prefer their Duty to God and their Country, before their own private
<PB N="92" REF="006120_0109_1027EC51411C1E60">Intere&s;t. But, upon the latter Suppo&s;ition, nothing could be included, but that Chri&s;tianity was an Ene|my to the publick Good of human Society, and that it tended to conclude whole Nations under Slavery and Oppre&s;&s;ion; unle&s;s, at the &s;ame time, it could be &s;hewn, that Chri&s;tians have good and ra|tional Grounds to hope for a miraculous, or to tru&s;t in an ordinary Providence, without the U&s;e of Means for their Protection.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the Practice, we are urged with the Te&s;timony of the primitive Chri&s;tians e&s;pecially of the Fathers) again&s;t the Unlawfulne&s;s of War un|der the Go&s;pel. To which I reply; That tho' the univer&s;al Te&s;timony of the primitive Fathers of the Chri&s;tian Church, as to Matters of Fact, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be received; yet their Judgment, in any difficult Point, or any Part of their Practice depend|ing upon their Judgment, ought not to be any far|the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> regarded, than as it is founded either on the Rea&s;on of the Thing it&s;elf, or on the Declarations of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. As to the Point before us then, nothing can be concluded from the Sayings of the Fathers, but that it was the Opinion of &s;ome private Men. The fir&s;t Te&s;timony the <HI>V.</HI> quotes is that of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> a Man-made Mini&s;ter, and an eminent Bi&s;hop, who&s;e Te&s;timony, if it be authen|tick in every Point he treats of, will be very little to the <HI>V</HI>'s Credit. And be&s;ides, what he &s;ays in that Pa&s;&s;age he hath quoted from him, relates intirely to his own Order, as will evidently appear to any One that can read his Offices, a Book wrote by him on purpo&s;e to teach Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks their Duty; which rather implies, that others were not concluded by the &s;ame Rule, than the contrary. <HI>Again&s;t Arms and Soldiers,</HI> &s;ays he, in another Place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. <HI>5.</HI> Orat. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>, <HI>we have no other Weapons but Tears; for the&s;e are the only Forts and Muniments of a Prie&s;t.</HI></P>

They might indeed bear the Name of Chri&s;tians, as Multitudes do Now-a-days.</Q> An&s;wer; It appears from what I have ju&s;t now &s;aid, that there were many Soldiers among the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians, who did more than bear the Name of Chri&s;tians; for they &s;uffered Martyrdom, not becau&s;e they would not bear Arms, but becau&s;e they would not renounce Chri&s;tianity. And even tho&s;e Soldiers in <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>'s Army, might be more than meer nominal Chri&s;tians, tho' they were not &s;o &s;cru|pulous as <HI>Maximilian</HI> was; who by mi&s;taking the true Meaning of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Go&s;pel (as &s;ome now-a-days do) might think they imply'd a Pro|hibition
<PB N="97" REF="006120_0114_1027EC2E46C7A438">of all U&s;e of the Sword. But this <HI>V.</HI> I find, will allow none to be more than nominal Chri&s;tians, who have not got an Under&s;tanding exactly of a Size with his own; in which Ca&s;e, I can a&s;&s;ure him, eve|ry Authority he hath here quoted, will be but a no|minal Chri&s;tian; for they and he differ very widely on every Point of the Chri&s;tian Religion, however well he may think they agree in this. But further; that there were Soldiers in the primitive Times, that were more than meer nominal Chri&s;tians, will ap|pear from the noted Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Thebean</HI> Legion. But before I proceed to give any Account of it, it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that &s;ometimes when the Per&s;ecution was heightened, all the Chri&s;tian Soldiers and Officers, as well as others, were commanded to renounce Chri&s;tianity, and embrace Pagani&s;m, by pouring Incen&s;e on the Altar to the Heathen Gods, or delivering up their Bibles, and the like, which, tho' &s;ome thro' Fear comply'd with, yet great Numbers ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it; and this drew upon them the Torments they &s;uffered. Now this Legion having been converted unto Chri&s;tianity &s;ome Time before by the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when they lay in <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> as <HI>Eucheri|us</HI> &s;aith, contentedly &s;erv'd in the Army all that Time, but being &s;u&s;pected by the Emperor <HI>Maximian</HI> of having embrac'd Chri&s;tianity, they were command|ed to &s;acrifice to Idols; which they ab&s;olutely refu|&s;ing, and confe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, were all put to Death at the Emperor's Command. Now this Legion, though very powerful (it con&s;i&s;t|ing of 6666 brave Soldiers) did not attempt any Re&s;i&s;tance; both becau&s;e it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible for them to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Emperor's whole Army, and becau&s;e they look'd upon it as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Duty of Subjects to oppo&s;e their Magi&s;trates in the Execution of the Laws. But tho' they would not defend them&s;elves again&s;t their own Magi&s;trates (which indeed would
<PB N="98" REF="006120_0115_1027EC312EE43620">not have been agreeable to the Law of Nature) yet it appears from the noble Speech they made before their Execution, that they were not principled again&s;t bearing Arms in Defence of their Country. <Q>A|gain&s;t any foreign Power, &s;ay they, we freely of|fer our Hands, which yet we dare not imbrue in the Blood of Innocents. Our Arms which have been long practis'd in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Vice, and in van|qui&s;hing Foes, never yet knew how to oppre&s;s the Righteous, or to cut the Throats of our Neigh|bours and Fellow Citizens. When fir&s;t we enga|ged in War, we remember it was to protect, and not to de&s;troy: We have hitherto fought for Ju|&s;tice, for Piety, for the Defence of Innocence; for the&s;e Prizes we have &s;lighted all Dangers; we have fought for the Defence of our Faith, which &s;hould we have broke with God, how can&s;t thou, O Emperor! expect that we &s;hould keep with thee?</Q></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, in mo&s;t of the antient Per&s;ecutions, we find Examples of Chri&s;tian Soldiers, who were as content and ready to die Martyrs, as any other Chri&s;tians. In <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Time, it appears, they were as couragious in pa&s;&s;ive, as active Valour. And in the Per&s;ecution of <HI>Decius,</HI> we read of a File, or, as &s;ome render it, a Troop of Soldiers, who attending in the Court of Judicature, where Chri&s;tians were try'd for their Religion, ran to the Bar, and cry'd out, We are Chri&s;tians; and made the Judges them&s;elves tremble. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &s;aith, <Q>Chri&s;tian Soldiers went out in a Kind of Pomp and State to die, and rejoic'd at the Te&s;timony they were to give for the Faith.</Q> I could bring many more Examples of this Nature among the Chri&s;tian Soldiers, but this is enough to &s;hew, that there were Numbers of Soldiers among the primi|tive Chri&s;tians that were more than meer nominal Chri&s;tians, as this <HI>V.</HI> uncharitably &s;ugge&s;ts. From
<PB N="99" REF="006120_0116_1027EC365FA1E680">all which it appears, that nothing can be concluded from the Te&s;timony or Practice of the primitive Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War again&s;t a foreign Invader.</P>
<P>BUT even &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ome of the Chri&s;tian Fa|thers were really of Opinion, that all War was un|lawful under the Go&s;pel; what then? Will this a|mount to a Proof that it really is &s;o? Every Father the <HI>V.</HI> hath quoted, taught Doctrines, and held Opi|nions more zealou&s;ly than he can prove they did the Unlawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War; and yet I pre&s;ume their Authority has no Weight with him in the&s;e Points. St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> maintain'd the Nece&s;&s;ity of E|pi&s;copacy to the Being of a true Church, that Wa|ter Bapti&s;m, and the Belief of the Re&s;urrection of the &s;ame Body, were nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation (as did all the Fathers he hath mentioned.) <HI>Athenagoras</HI> main|tain'd the Wor&s;hip of Angels, and that they were created to take Care of Things here below. He recommends Virginity, condemns &s;econd Marriages, and calls them an honourable Adultery.</P>
<P>TERTULLIAN, who writes more like a Poet than an Hi&s;torian, can hardly ever be literally interpreted, without making him to appear a Wri|ter of no good Character. He a&s;&s;erts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Idol. Cap. <HI>17.</HI></NOTE>, That a Chri&s;tian cannot in Con&s;cience perform the Function of a Judge, nor &s;erve as an Executioner of Ju&s;tice.

ORIGEN maintains, that all intelligent Beings ever did, and ever &s;hall, exi&s;t; that they have been always free to do Good and Evil, and that they have been precipitated into low|er Places, and confin'd to Bodies for a Puni&s;hment of their Sins<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Principiis Strome.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Maximilian,</HI> who, as the <HI>V.</HI> &s;ays &s;uffered Death for refu&s;ing to bear Arms, nothing can be inferr'd from this ob&s;cure &s;ingle In&s;tance again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of the Practice; &s;ince, as I have &s;hewn, many Chri&s;tians who &s;uffered Death for the &s;ake of their Religion did &s;o. Either there might be &s;ome Circum|&s;tance attending his particular Ca&s;e, which made it his Duty to refu&s;e it; or he may have been one of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians we read of, who were &s;o intemperate in their Zeal, that they ran unnece&s;&s;arily to Torments, and de&s;ir'd rather to be condemn'd than ab&s;olved; and did &s;everal other Things in which we are under no Obligation to follow their Steps, nor to think that they were obliged by any Precept of the Go&s;pel to act as they did. Now what I would ob&s;erve, from what I have &s;aid upon the&s;e Opinions of the Fathers, is this; That if this <HI>V.</HI> will not allow the Authority of the&s;e Fathers in one Ca&s;e, as I am pret|ty confident he will not, why &s;hould he urge it &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in another? If the univer&s;al Example of the primitive Chri&s;ti|ans is not to be followed in one Ca&s;e, it cannot, if we con&s;ider it by it&s;elf, be ju&s;tly accounted of greater Force in any other.</P>
<P>IT may ju&s;tly be expected, that they who argue &s;o &s;trongly from their Example, according to the Account given of it by the&s;e Antients, &s;hould imitate it in all other In&s;tances recorded by the &s;ame Writers, or, at lea&s;t, argue for the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o doing. But whil&s;t they acknowledge no &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity in many other Ca&s;es, we cannot think their bare Example to be, in this Ca&s;e only, of great Importance, even could it be prov|ed. But in Truth none of the Fathers &s;ay any thing from whence it can be concluded, that Defen&s;ive War, again&s;t a fo|reign Enemy, was reckoned unlawful by the primitive Chri&s;ti|ans. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> 'tis true, &s;eems, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to &s;peak doubtfully of it, not becau&s;e it was in it&s;elf unlawful, as I ob|&s;erved above, but becau&s;e Chri&s;tian Soldiers were apt to be ex|po&s;ed to &s;ome Actions which were not con&s;i&s;tent with their Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion. Hence we find he objects in one Place, <Q>That Chri&s;tian Soldiers were &s;ometimes commanded to &s;wear by the Heathen Gods:</Q> Whereupon in another Place he ar|gues thus; <Q>Shall, &s;ays he, a Chri&s;tian watch to guard the Temples of tho&s;e Gods whom he hath renounced? Shall he &s;up there where he is forbidden to eat? Shall he defend tho&s;e Spirits by Night, which he exorci&s;eth by Day?</Q> And then he adds; <Q>How many other great Offences may be &s;een in military Duties, which cannot be otherwi&s;e interpret|ed, but as Breaches of our Chri&s;tian Laws?</Q> But tho' in
<PB N="101" REF="006120_0118_1027EC3AA9471F98">&s;ome Places he thus &s;peaks doubtfully, yet in other Places he &s;peaks more favourably, &s;o as to make it appear, that he did not under&s;tand it to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Purity and Perfecti|on of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He &s;peaks of it as dangerous, but not as unlawful; and that it is &s;o, I know no body that will deny. Be&s;ides, the Places I have quoted already, wherein this Father &s;peaks favourably of a ju&s;t War, in his <HI>Idololatria,</HI> he &s;ays; <Q>It is much que&s;tioned whether Chri&s;tians may take Arms, or whether Soldiers may be admitted to Chri&s;tianity.</Q> And in his <HI>Corona Militis,</HI> after he had di&s;puted a while again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of War, he at length di&s;tingui&s;hes between him that entered into Arms before he was baptized, and him that li&s;ted him&s;elf after Bapti&s;m. <Q>For, &s;ays he, their Condition is plainly otherwi&s;e, who being fir&s;t Soldiers, were afterwards converted to the Faith, as theirs whom St. <HI>John</HI> admitted to his Bapti&s;m; or that faithful Centurion's whom Chri&s;t ap|proved of, and whom St. <HI>Peter</HI> in&s;tructed; provided that having once embraced the Chri&s;tian Faith, and being &s;ealed up thereunto by Bapti&s;m; they either renounce the War pre&s;ently, as &s;ome have done, or take &s;pecial Care that they do nothing therein that may offend God.</Q> Whence it is evi|dent, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> look'd upon the military Office only as dangerous, but not as unlawful; becau&s;e Chri&s;tians might con|tinue in Arms after Bapti&s;m, which certainly would not have been permitted by him, if he had thought that all War was con|trary to the Go&s;pel, no more than Magicians and Sooth&s;ayers were permitted after Bapti&s;m to retain their unlawful Profe&s;&s;i|ons. <Q>They who profe&s;s &s;uch Arts as the Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline do not allow, &s;ays he<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Idel. Cap. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE>, are not to be admitted into the Church of Chri&s;t.</Q> And of the &s;ame Opinion were St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tine</HI> and St. <HI>Cyprian.</HI> I have &s;hewn above, that both St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> and St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> approv'd of a ju&s;t War, and &s;o did St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> and St. <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> <Q>Good Men, &s;aith the Fir&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Civitate Dei, Lib. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE>, make War their Refuge; but wicked Men make it their Delight.</Q> And the La&s;t gives this Te&s;timony of the primitive Chri&s;tians; 'That their Ance&s;tors never accounted that Execution which was done in a ju&s;t War as Murder; but always held them excus'd, that fought for the Defence of Cha&s;tity, and of Piety.</P>
<P>NEITHER was there any one Bi&s;hop, that we read of, among &s;o many that were great Sufferers for Religion, that ever re|prov'd <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> (who was turn'd Chri&s;tian) for making War, or that ever endeavoured to make his Soldiers decline it; tho' many of them were very &s;evere Di&s;ciplinarians, &s;paring neither Prince nor People, that were defective in their Duties. Now let the impartial Reader but con&s;ider what this <HI>V.</HI> hath alledg|ed from the Example and Te&s;timony of the primitive Chri&s;tians to prove the Unlawfulne&s;s of Defen&s;ive War, and what I have
<PB N="102" REF="006120_0119_1027EC40AD1D83C8">advanced in An&s;wer thereto, and then let him judge with what A&s;&s;urance he could &s;ay, <Q>That the Examples and Te&s;timonies of the primitive Chri&s;tians, that Obedience to the Go&s;pel had that Effect, not only to give Chri&s;tians inward Peace, but to take away the U&s;e of carnal Weapons, are very &s;trong and co|gent Proofs, that War cannot be con&s;i&s;tent with the Purity and Perfection of the Chri&s;tian Religion</Q> And even tho' it may appear doubtful, whether the&s;e Antients look'd upon all War to be unlawful, which, to me, it does not, yet we ought not from thence to make any Doubt, whether it be lawful for us to enter into a nece&s;&s;ary War for defending our Country again&s;t a foreign Enemy. Many of the primitive Fathers di&s;allow'd of &s;econd Marriages, and &s;everal other lawful Practices, as I have &s;hewn above; yet no wife Man will conclude, that they are in them&s;elves unlawful. For tho' the Omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Practices might be expedient then, and, in &s;ome Circum&s;tances, Orna|ments of the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and acceptable to God; &s;uch as Celibacy in times of Per&s;ecution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they are not im|pos'd upon as by the Nece&s;&s;ity of any Law.</P>
<P>NAY further; Admit there are &s;ome Texts of Scripture, which &s;eemingly forbid all Sorts of War; yet &s;ince it hath been reckoned by all good Men a Means &s;ufficient for avoiding per&s;onal Inconveniencies (as cutting off a Right hand, or pluck|ing out a Right-eye) to admit of any Sen&s;e rather than the literal; much rather &s;hould tho&s;e Places of Scriptute that are urg'd again&s;t the U&s;e of carnal Weapons in Defence of Mens Lives and Liberties admit of any Sen&s;e, than that Chri&s;tianity &s;hould be made to de&s;troy that which is one of the main Pillars of Human Society. For if it be granted that the World cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Government, nor any Government without Pro|tection and Defence, which every Body but a wild Vi&s;ionary, or bare fac'd Hypocrite, will readily grant; then it is as cer|tain, that that Religion cannot be Good, which teaches &s;uch Doctrines, which, if followed, thro' their native Con&s;equen|ces, will de&s;troy all Government, and turn human Society into a Field of Blood. And therefore I conclude, that every &s;uch Doctrine, let its Pretences to Sanctity be ever &s;o &s;pecious, and the Abettors of it ever &s;o preci&s;e, ought not only to be held in the utmo&s;t Abhorrence and Dete&s;tation, by every true Friend to his Country, but to be &s;uppre&s;t with all po&s;&s;ible Care and Pru|dence, as a Nui&s;ance and Pe&s;t to the Government where it is main|tain'd, and an egregious Reproach to the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
