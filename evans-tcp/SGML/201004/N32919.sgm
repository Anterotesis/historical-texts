<P><HI>EGYPT</HI> &s;hall be a de&s;olation, and <HI>EDOM</HI> &s;hall be a de|&s;olate wilderne&s;s, for the violence again&s;t the chil|dren of Judah, becau&s;e they have &s;hed INNO|CENT BLOOD in their land.

<P>NEXT to the acknowledgement of the exi&s;tence of a Deity, there is no one principle of greater importance in religion, than a realizing belief of the divine government and providence, as &s;uperintending the affairs of the univer&s;e, and in|timately concerned in whatever happens to mankind, both as nations and kingdoms, and as individuals.</P>
<P>Deeply to be impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the divine providence, to realize that GOD is Govornor among the nations, that his government is wi&s;e and ju&s;t, and that all our times and changes are in his hands, and at his di&s;po&s;al, will have the happie&s;t tendency to excite the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgements of his good|ne&s;s in pro&s;perity, the mo&s;t cordial re&s;ignation to his paternal di&s;cipline in adver&s;ity, and the mo&s;t placid compo&s;ure and equanimity of mind in all the chang|ing &s;cenes of life. In&s;pired with this divine principle, we &s;hall contemplate, with grateful wonder and de|light,
<PB N="6" REF="043231_0004_101CD950BAD441C8">
the goodne&s;s of God in pro&s;perous events, and devoutly acknowledge and adore his &s;overeign hand in days of darkne&s;s and perplexity, and when the greate&s;t difficulties pre&s;s. This will be a &s;ource of comfort and &s;upport under private afflictions and trials, and this &s;hall encourage our hope in God and tru&s;t in his name, under public calamities and judgments.&mdash; Yea, however dark and my&s;terious the ways of pro|vidence may appear; yet nothing &s;hall overwhelm the mind, or de&s;troy the tru&s;t and hope of tho&s;e, that realize the government of heaven,&mdash;that realize, that an alwi&s;e God is &s;eated on the throne, and that all things are well appointed for his cho&s;en people,&mdash;for them that fear him.</P>
<P>This principle and the&s;e &s;entiments therefore, being of &s;o great u&s;e and importance in religion, un|der the various di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, one great de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, is to rou&s;e and excite us to a religious acknowledgment of the hand of God, in tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes of MURDER, BLOOD|SHED and WAR, we are met to commemorate, upon this &s;olemn occa&s;ion</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age before us, it is humbly conceived, is well &s;uited to confirm our faith, to excite our tru&s;t, and encourage our hope, under &s;uch awful di&s;pen&s;a|tions, as it points out the method of God's govern|ment and the cour&s;e of his providence towards the enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors of his people, and the fate of tho&s;e that &s;hed <HI>innocent blood;</HI> and at the &s;ame time, repre&s;ents his peculiar care of his church and cho&s;en, and the a&s;&s;urance they have, when under oppre&s;&s;ion, of re&s;toration and e&s;tabli&s;hment,&mdash;and that <HI>God him|&s;elf</HI> will plead their cau&s;e and both <HI>clean&s;e</HI> and <HI>avenge</HI> their <HI>innocent blood. "Egypt</HI> &s;hall be a de&s;olation, and <HI>Edom</HI> &s;hall be a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, for the <HI>vio|lence</HI> again&s;t the <HI>children of Judah,</HI> becau&s;e they
<PB N="7" REF="043231_0005_101CD953D00ABC38">
have &s;hed <HI>INNOCENT BLOOD in their land.</HI> But <HI>Judah</HI> &s;hall dwell forever, and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> from generation to generation. For <HI>I will clean&s;e their blood,</HI> that I have not clean&s;ed; for the LORD dwelleth in Zion."</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to enquire as to the immediate occa&s;ion, or literal fulfilment of the prephecy before us, with re&s;pect to the particular nations, or kingdoms here mentioned. It is &s;ufficient to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Egypt</HI> was early noted, in &s;crip|ture hi&s;tory, for oppre&s;&s;ing God's people, and cau&s;ing them to &s;erve with <HI>cruel bondage. Edom</HI> al&s;o is mentioned as guilty of <HI>violence</HI> towards them, and expre&s;&s;ing a mo&s;t imbittered hatred and revenge again&s;t them; and from the expre&s;&s;ions in the text, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that there had been &s;ome, if not many in&s;tances of their &s;hedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. P&s;al. cxxxvii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> God's cho&s;en people, had often &s;uffered violence, from both the&s;e &s;tates: So that we have good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that both <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> in the language of &s;cripture prophecy, in the text and other pa&s;&s;ages, may intend not <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Edom</HI> only, but (proverbially) in a more general &s;en&s;e, enemies, per&s;ecutors or oppre&s;&s;ors of God's people, who violated their rights and liberties, religi|ous and civil, and by the &s;word of per&s;ecution or op|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;hed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.</P>
<P>Prophecies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are, or may be, of general u&s;e to the people of God, are but &s;eldom literal, either in prediction or fulfilment. They are rather of u&s;e to fore&s;hew great and intere&s;ting events, as taking place in the world, in &s;uch time and man|ner, and upon &s;uch per&s;ons, &s;ocieties, nations, or kingdoms, as &s;hall di&s;play the ju&s;tice and equity of divine government, and the peculiar care which
<PB N="8" REF="043231_0006_101CD95564FA1C38">
Heaven takes of the church and people of God, for their correction, in&s;truction, pre&s;ervation or e&s;tab|li&s;hment. Agreeably St. Peter &s;peaks &s;trongly for this method of explaining and improving &s;cripture prophecies, where he &s;ays expre&s;sly, that "no pro|phecy of the &s;cripture is of any private interpretati|on."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 20.</NOTE> It is, therefore, rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that though prophecies may have &s;pecial or immediate reference to particular per&s;ons, &s;ocieties, nations or kingdoms, and to events in which they may be im|mediately intere&s;ted; yet they may be fitly con|&s;idered as having a further and more important in|terpretation, which may be of general u&s;e for the di|rection and edification of God's church and people, in all ages, to the end. In this general &s;en&s;e, there|fore, you will permit me to con&s;ider the prophecy in the pa&s;&s;age before us: and thus under&s;tood, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee &s;everal things &s;ugge&s;ted in it, worthy our mo&s;t &s;erious attention and religious improvement, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is admitted, that for wi&s;e pur|po&s;es, a ju&s;t God may permit powerful enemies, or oppre&s;&s;ors, to injure, do violence unto and di&s;tre&s;s his people, and to carry their mea&s;ures of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion to &s;uch lengths among them, as to &s;trike at their life and "&s;hed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land."</P>
<P>As God is the Sovereign of the world, and exer|ci&s;es his government for the glory of his name, in the good of the whole, &s;o he hath a paternal concern for the &s;pecial benefit and improvement of his church and people. All creatures are his &s;ervants: and God accompli&s;heth his de&s;igns and carries his coun|&s;els to effect, by what means and in&s;truments he plea&s;es. It is with him alone, 'who is wonderful in coun&s;el
<PB N="9" REF="043231_0007_101CD95C59245EF0">
and excellent in working," to bring good out of evil. When God de&s;igns the re roof and correction of his people, he can exerci&s;e this holy di&s;cipline in various ways and by various means, as &s;hall be&s;t an|&s;wer the purpo&s;es of his government. This holy di&s;cipline is accordingly exerci&s;ed, &s;ometimes by the immediate hand of providence: as in wa&s;ting &s;ick|ne&s;s parching drought, awful and de&s;olating earth|quakes, or other judgments, which are immediately from God him&s;elf. Or this may be done more im|mediately, by the in&s;trumentality of his creatures; and even the wicked, and tho&s;e that love the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that delight in oppre&s;&s;ion, wa&s;te and &s;poil, or thir&s;t for <HI>innocent blood,</HI> may be im|proved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the rod in his hand to correct, or puni&s;h the &s;ins of his people. With this view the oppre&s;&s;or is per|mitted to injure, in&s;ult, oppre&s;s and lay wa&s;te in a land; and to carry his mea&s;ures to the &s;hedding of inno|cent blood. With the &s;ame de&s;ign does a &s;overeign God give the enemy a commi&s;&s;ion, in war, with fire and &s;word, to di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;troy.</P>
<P>In &s;uch public calamities, it is true, it often comes to pa&s;s, that as individuals, the innocent are involved and &s;uffer with the guilty; and &s;ometimes the in|nocent alone. But however unju&s;t, or cruel the op|pre&s;&s;or, and tho&s;e that thir&s;t for blood may be, in contriving and carrying into execution their wicked, oppr&s;&s;ieve, or <HI>bloody</HI> de&s;igns, they are no other than in&s;truments in providence and the rod in the hand of the great Governor of the world, for the reproof and correction of his people. The&s;e things happen not by accident, or chance, but by the direction, or per|mi&s;&s;ion of that God, who is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works. When I&s;rael &s;inned and did evil in the &s;ight of the LORD, it is &s;aid, "the anger of the LORD was hot again&s;t I&s;rael, and he
<PB N="10" REF="043231_0008_101CD95E12351260">
delivered them into the hands of &s;poilers that &s;poiled them, and he &s;old them into the hands of their ene|mies round about and they were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. ii. 14, 15.</NOTE> Hence al&s;o the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian King</HI> is expre&s;sly called <HI>"the rod of</HI> GOD'S <HI>anger,"</HI> for the correction of his people.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. x. 5.</NOTE> And thus <HI>Egyp</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> in the pro|phecy before us, in committing violence upon the children of <HI>Judah</HI> and in &s;hedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land, are held up to view as the rod in GOD'S hand, for the correction, reproof and in&s;truction of his people. Agreeably&punc; this is the language of a ju&s;t and faithful GOD, in &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations, "<HI>hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mic. vi. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>It matters not, therefore, who are the immediate in&s;truments of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, or by who&s;e hands the blood of innocent per&s;ons is &s;hed, or their &s;ub&s;tance wa&s;ted and habitations de&s;troyed; nor yet from what motives, or views &s;uch acts of oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty are perpetrated, with re&s;pect to the re|ligious improvement, that GOD expects us, or any people, to make of &s;uch heavy di&s;pen&s;ations. 'Tis GOD, and his hand&mdash;'tis GOD and his providence, which we are fir&s;t of all concerned to notice, acknow|ledge and improve. However unju&s;t our &s;ufferings may be from man; yet, when we realize the hand of GOD, the great and wi&s;e Governor of the world, as concerned herein, &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is our indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty, and no murmer, or complaint ought ever to be heard, but with reverence and humility it becomes us to bow before the LORD, and adoring his &s;overeignty, a&s;cribe righteou&s;ne&s;s to our GOD. Neither the in&s;ults of oppre&s;&s;ors, nor the flames of our once delightful habitations, nor even the <HI>inno|cent blood</HI> of our <HI>brethren &s;lain,</HI> &s;hould move to a murmuring word or an angry thought, again&s;t GOD,
<PB N="11" REF="043231_0009_101CD962785FEE38">
his government, or providence.&mdash;"Shall we receive good at the hand of GOD, and &s;hall we not receive evil?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job ii. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;And "&s;hall not the Judge of all the earth do right!"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 25.</NOTE> The more grievou&s;ly we are &s;mitten, the more deeply we are affected, the more carefully &s;hould we endeavour to realize our dependence upon GOD, the more religiou&s;ly acknowledge his hand, and the more earne&s;tly return to him that &s;mites. This is the le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction, which GOD expects we &s;hould learn, by &s;uch bitter di&s;pen&s;ations, and this the improvement he looks for, in us and his peo|ple, in order to the re&s;toration of his favour and our redemption from enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors, who threaten to lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy. May the&s;e things, then, be deeply impre&s;&s;ed on each of our hearts.&mdash;But I pa&s;s</P>
<P>Secondly, To ob&s;erve the fate of oppre&s;&s;ors, and the &s;entence of heaven again&s;t tho&s;e, that do violence to GOD'S people and &s;hed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land. <HI>Egypt &s;hall be a de&s;olation, and Edom &s;hall be a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, for the violence again&s;t the children of Judah, becau&s;e they have &s;hed innocent blood in their land.</HI></P>
<P>However ju&s;t it may be in GOD to correct his peo|ple, and whatever right is a&s;cribed to him of improv|ing the wicked, as the rod in his hand to correct, or the &s;word to puni&s;h them; yet this alters not the nature of their oppre&s;&s;ive de&s;igns, neither does it abate their guilt, or alleviate their crime, in the&s;e mea&s;ures of inju&s;tice, violence or cruelty, by which the people of GOD are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus GOD &s;peaks of the A&s;&s;yrian king, a prince noted in hi&s;tory for his avarice and ambition, cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, (and in him, of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian &s;tate,</HI> who&s;e character was included in that of its king) &s;aying&mdash;"O A&s;&s;yrian, the rod of mine anger, and
<PB N="12" REF="043231_0010_101CD9640FE9F980">
the &s;taff in their hand is mine indignation. I will &s;end him to an hypocritical nation; and again&s;t the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the &s;poil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the &s;treets. Howbeit, he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his heart think &s;o, but it is in his heart to de&s;troy. Wherefore it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that when the LORD hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;yria, and the glory of his high looks."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. x. 5.&mdash;12.</NOTE> And &s;o it came to pa&s;s: For this power, that with &s;uch a mighty hand, and for &s;o long a time, oppre&s;&s;ed GOD'S people and other nations, in GOD'S due time, felt the weight of the iron yoke and received double for all the inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty it had exerci&s;ed towards others.</P>
<P>In this, and many other circum&s;tances, with which hi&s;tory abounds, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee the fate of the ene|mies of GOD'S people and oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind.&mdash; But we need not go from the text, for &s;atisfaction in this matter. In the words of the prophecy before us, we have the &s;entence of heaven again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ors of GOD'S people and the doom of tho&s;e common enemies of mankind, pronounced, and the rea&s;on thereof a&s;&s;igned, in the cleare&s;t terms. <HI>Egypt &s;hall be a de&s;olation, Edom &s;hall be a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, for the violence again&s;t the children of Judas, be|cau&s;e they have &s;hed innocent blood in their land.</HI></P>
<P>The LORD is a GOD, that loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s and hateth iniquity, in whatever &s;hape, or character it appears. Inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion and violence (much le&s;s the &s;hedding of innocent blood) &s;hall not pa&s;s un|noticed, by the ju&s;t Governor of the world. Sooner, or later, a ju&s;t recompence will be made upon &s;uch workers of iniquity.&mdash;Yea, though hand join in hand,
<PB N="13" REF="043231_0011_101CD968ADC08E10">
in mea&s;ures of oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, again&s;t GOD'S people; and though their avarice, ambition, and law|le&s;s thir&s;t for power and domination, may carry them on, 'till their &s;teps &s;hall be marked with <HI>innocent blood;</HI> yet, certain it is, they &s;hall not, finally, go unpuni&s;hed. For a time, indeed, and but for a ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;uch workers of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch de&s;troyers of mankind may practi&s;e and pro&s;per; but 'vengeance &s;low, is vengeance &s;ure.' Their ways are marked before GOD. Their puni&s;hment and de&s;truction are &s;ealed in his pre&s;ence: And the time is ha&s;tning, when de&s;truction, without remedy, &s;hall be their portion.</P>
<P>The truth of the&s;e &s;entiments hath often been verified in providence, and the proud princes and the mo&s;t powerful &s;tates have been taught, by &s;evere, by fatal experience, that de&s;olation from the LORD awaits the impiety of tho&s;e, that do v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olence to his people and '&s;hed <HI>innocent blood</HI> in their land.'</P>
<P>Here then we may &s;ee the light in which that peo|ple, or nation, are to be con&s;idered, that walk in the ways of oppre&s;&s;ion, and that thir&s;t for and &s;hed inno|cent blood. Here we may al&s;o &s;ee the ruin to which they are ha&s;tning, the awful judgments that await them, and the great rea&s;on they have to fear the &s;en|tence of heaven, denounced again&s;t them, in the pro|phecy before us, and its literal fulfilment upon them. Which naturally leads in the la&s;t place.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To ob&s;erve, in the prophecy before us, the peculiar care GOD takes of his church and people, and the a&s;&s;urance they have, even when actually &s;uffering violence and under the cruel hand of op|pre&s;&s;ion, of redemption, re&s;toration and e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that GOD him&s;elf will plead their cau&s;e, and both <HI>clean&s;e</HI> and <HI>avenge</HI> their innocent blood. Nothing can be more directly expre&s;&s;ive of this &s;entiment, or
<PB N="14" REF="043231_0012_101CD96A4208A910">
a firmer ground of a&s;&s;urance, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's cho&s;en people in the be|lief of it, than the promi&s;e and prephecy, concerning Judah and Jeru&s;alem in the text. While <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> while the enemies and oppre&s;&s;iors of God's people, are doomed to that de&s;olation, they &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erve, the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances are given, "that <HI>Judah</HI> &s;hall dwell forever, and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> from ge|neration to generation For I, &s;aith God, will clean&s;e their blood, that I have not clean&s;ed: For the Lord dwelleth in Zion." The words are plain, and need no comment. They &s;peak the language of &s;cripture, fact and experience, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's church and cho&s;en, in days of per|plexity and darkne&s;s and when actually under the in|ju&s;tice, violence and cruelty of inveterate enemies, or <HI>blood thir&s;ty</HI> oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Here are two things, for the inducement and con|firmation of the faith and hope of God's church and people, in &s;uch times of darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, which are well worthy &s;erious notice and attention.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, God's word and promi&s;e, in which he a&s;&s;ures his people, that notwith&s;tanding the violence of their enemies again&s;t them, and the di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow their oppre&s;&s;ors may have cau&s;ed them, by &s;hedding <HI>innocent blood</HI> among them; yet they &s;hall never avail to overthrow, or de&s;troy them; but they &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be redeemed and delivered out of their hands, and re|&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed, as his church and people, in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>

This holy di&s;ciple is no more than what God hath given his people to expect, as a reproof of their declen&s;ions, and as a means of bringing them to a &s;en&s;e of their dependence upon him. Such di&s;|pen&s;ations, are &s;o far from being an evidence, that God hath for&s;aken his people, given them up, or for|gotten to be gracious, that they are rather to be con|&s;idered as demon&s;trations of his paternal care and faithfulne&s;s towards them. Agreeably, in his coven|ant with his &s;ervant David and his hou&s;e, this method of conduct is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, as a token of his &s;pecial care and faithfulne&s;s, and of the remembrance of the covenant he had made. "If his children for|&s;ake my law, and walk not in my judgments:&mdash;Then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with the rod and their iniquity with &s;tripes.

<P>ON the evening of the <HI>eighteenth</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1775, we received two me&s;&s;ages; the fir&s;t verbal, the other <HI>by expre&s;s, in writing,</HI> from the <HI>committee of &s;afety,</HI> who were then &s;itting in the we&s;terly part of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> directed to the Honorable JOHN HANCOCK, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (who, with the Honorable SAMUEL ADAMS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was then providentially with us) informing, "that <HI>eight</HI> or <HI>nine officers</HI> of the <HI>king's troops</HI> were &s;een, ju&s;t be|fore night, pa&s;&s;ing the road towards <HI>Lexington,</HI> in a <HI>mu&s;ing, con|templative</HI> po&s;ture; and it was &s;u&s;pected they were out upon &s;ome evil de&s;ign."</P>
<P>As both the&s;e gentlemen had been frequently and even <HI>pub|licly,</HI> threatened, by the enemies of <HI>this people,</HI> both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> with the <HI>vengeance</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h admini&s;tration:</HI>&mdash; And as Mr. <HI>Hancock</HI> in particular had been, more than once, <HI>per&s;onally in&s;ulted,</HI> by &s;ome officers of the troops, in Bo&s;ton; it was not without &s;ome ju&s;t grounds &s;uppo&s;ed, that under cover of the darkne&s;s, <HI>&s;udden arre&s;t,</HI> if not <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination</HI> might be attempted, by the&s;e <HI>in&s;truments of tyranny!</HI></P>
<P>To prevent any thing of this kind, <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twelve</HI> men were immediately collected, in arms, to guard my hou&s;e, through the night.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;aid <HI>officers</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through this town, on the road towards <HI>Concord:</HI> It was therefore thought expedient to watch their motions, and if po&s;&s;ible make &s;ome di&s;covery of their intentions. Accordingly, about 10 o'clock in the evening, three men, on hor&s;es, were di&s;patched for this purpo&s;e. As they were <HI>peaceably</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the road towards <HI>Concord,</HI> in the borders of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> they were &s;uddenly &s;topped by <HI>&s;aid officers,</HI> who rode up to them, and putting pi&s;tols to their brea&s;ts and &s;eizing their hor&s;es bridles, <HI>&s;wore, if they &s;tirred another &s;tep, they &s;hould be all dead men!</HI>&mdash;The officers detained them &s;everal hours, as <HI>pri&s;on|ers,</HI> examined, &s;earched, abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted them; and in their ha&s;ty return (&s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves di&s;covered) they left them in Lexington.&mdash;Said officers al&s;o took into cu&s;tody, abu&s;ed and <HI>threatened with their lives</HI> &s;everal other per&s;ons; &s;ome of whom they met peaceably pa&s;&s;ing on the road, others even at the doors of their dwellings, without the lea&s;t provocation, on the part of the inhabitants, or &s;o much as a que&s;tion a&s;ked by them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="043231_0031_101CD9A2EDBB65C0">Between the hours of <HI>twelve</HI> and <HI>one,</HI> on the morning of the NINETEENTH OF APRIL, we received intelligence, by expre&s;s, from the Honorable JOSEPH WARREN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> "that a large body of the <HI>king's troops</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ed to be a brigade of about 12, or 1500) were embarked in boats from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and gone over to land on <HI>Lech|mere's-Point</HI> (&s;o called) in <HI>Cambridge:</HI> And that it was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that they were ordered to &s;eize and de&s;troy the <HI>&s;tores, belonging to the colony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen depo&s;ited at Concord,</HI>" in con&s;equence of <HI>General Gage's unju&s;tifiable &s;eizure of the provincial magazine of powder at Medford,</HI> and other <HI>colony &s;tores</HI> in &s;everal other places.</P>
<P>Upon this intelligence, as al&s;o upon information of the conduct of the officers as above-mentioned, the <HI>militia</HI> of this town were alarmed, and ordered to meet on the u&s;ual place of parade; not with any de&s;ign of <HI>commencing ho&s;tilities</HI> upon the <HI>king's troops,</HI> but to con&s;ult what might be done for our own and the people's &s;afety: And al&s;o to be ready for whatever &s;ervice provi|dence might call us out to, upon this alarming occa&s;ion, in ca&s;e <HI>overt-acts</HI> of <HI>violence,</HI> or <HI>open ho&s;tilities</HI> &s;hould be committed by this <HI>mercenary band of armed and blood-thir&s;ty oppre&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, two per&s;ons were &s;ent expre&s;s to <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to gain intelligence of the motions of the troops, and what rout they took.</P>
<P>The <HI>militia</HI> met according to order; and waited the return of the me&s;&s;engers, that they might order their mea&s;ures as occa|&s;ion &s;hould require. Between 3 and 4 o'clock, one of the ex|pre&s;&s;es returned, informing, that there was no appearance of the troops, on the roads, either from <HI>Cambridge</HI> or <HI>Charle&s;town;</HI> and that it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>movements in the army</HI> the evening before, were only <HI>a feint</HI> to alarm the people. Upon this, there|fore, the <HI>militia company</HI> were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for the pre&s;ent, but with orders to be within call of the drum,&mdash;waiting the return of the other me&s;&s;enger, who was expected in about an hour, or &s;ooner, if any di&s;covery &s;hould be made of the motions of the troops.&mdash; But he was prevented by their &s;ilent and &s;udden arrival at the place where he was, waiting for intelligence.

<P>In &s;hort, &s;o far from <HI>firing fir&s;t</HI> upon the king's troops; upon the mo&s;t careful enquiry, it appears, that but very few of our people fired at all; and even <HI>they</HI> did not fire till after being fired upon by the troops, they were wounded them&s;elves, or &s;aw others killed, or wounded by them, and looked upon it next to impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>As to any firing from the <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> as <HI>Gage</HI> repre&s;ents; it is certain, that there were but <HI>four men</HI> in the meeting hou&s;e, when the troops came up: and they were then getting &s;ome am|munition, from the town &s;tock, and had not &s;o much as loaded their guns (except one, who never di&s;charged it) when the troops fired upon the <HI>militia.</HI> And as to the <HI>neighbouring hou&s;es,</HI> it is equally certain, that there was no firing from them, unle&s;s, after the di&s;per&s;ion of our men, &s;ome, who had fled to them for &s;helter, might fire from them upon the troops.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance more, before the brigade quitted Lexington, I beg leave to mention, as what may give a further &s;pecimen of the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>character,</HI> of the officers and men, of this body of troops.&mdash;After the <HI>militia company</HI> were di&s;per&s;ed and the firing

<P>Whether this &s;tep was <HI>honorary</HI> to the detachment, or agreeable to the rules of war&mdash;or how far it was expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>bravery, heroi&s;m</HI> and <HI>true military glory,</HI> for 800 di&s;ciplined troops of <HI>Great-Briain,</HI> without notice or provocation, to fall upon 60, or 70, undi&s;ciplined <HI>Americans,</HI> who neither oppo&s;ed nor mole&s;ted them, and <HI>murder</HI> &s;ome and di&s;per&s;e the re&s;t, and then to <HI>give the &s;hout</HI> and <HI>make the triumph of victory,</HI> is not for me to determine; but mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the impartial world to judge.&mdash;That "there is a God with whom is the power, and the glory, and the victory," is certain: but whether he will <HI>&s;et his &s;eal</HI> to the triumph, made upon this mo&s;t <HI>peculiar</HI> occa&s;ion, by following it with further &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and finally giving up <HI>this people</HI> into the hands of tho&s;e, that have thus <HI>cruelly</HI> commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, mu&s;t be left to time to di&s;cover.&mdash;But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, if it may be called a di&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having thus <HI>vanqui&s;hed the party</HI> in <HI>Lexington,</HI> the troops marched on for <HI>Concord,</HI> to execute their orders, in de&s;troying the &s;tores belonging to the colony, depo&s;ited there&mdash;They met with no interruption in their march to <HI>Concord.</HI>&mdash;But by &s;ome means or other, the people of <HI>Concord</HI> had notice of their approach and de&s;igns, and were alarmed about break of day; and collecting as &s;oon, and as many as po&s;&s;ible, improved the time they had be|fore the troops came upon them, to the be&s;t advantage, both for concealing and &s;ecuring as many of the public &s;tores as they could, and in preparing for defence. &mdash;By the &s;top of the troops at Lexington, many thou&s;ands were &s;aved to the colony, and they were, in a great mea&s;ure, fru&s;trated in their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the troops made their approach to the ea&s;terly part of the town, the provincials of <HI>Concord</HI> and &s;ome neighbouring towns, were collected and collecting in an advantageous po&s;t, on a hill, a little di&s;tance from the <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> north of the road, to the number of about 150, or 200: but finding the troops to be more than three times as many, they wi&s;ely retreated, fir&s;t to a hill about 80 rods further north, and then over, the <HI>north-bridge</HI> (&s;o called) about a mile from the town: and there they waited the coming of the <HI>militia</HI> of the towns adjacent, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Briti&s;h detachment marched into the center of the town. A party of about 200, was ordered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;aid bridge, other parties were di&s;patched to various
<PB N="6" REF="043231_0035_101CD9AB2C195650">
parts of the town, in &s;earch of public &s;tores, while the remainder were employed in &s;eizing and de&s;troying, whatever they could find in the <HI>town-hou&s;e,</HI> and other places, where &s;tores had been lodged.&mdash;But before they had accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign, they were interrupted by a di&s;charge of arms, at <HI>&s;aid bridge.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems, that of the party above-mentioned, as ordered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, one half were marched on about two miles, in &s;earch of &s;tores, at Col. <HI>Barret's</HI> and that part of the town: while the other half, con&s;i&s;ting of towards 100 men, under Capt. <HI>Lawrie,</HI> were left to guard the bridge. The pro|vincials, who were in &s;ight of the bridge, ob&s;erving the troops attempting to take up the planks of &s;aid bridge, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge them, and gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge.&mdash; They accordingly marched, but with expre&s;s orders not to fire, unle&s;s fir&s;t fired upon by the king's troops. Upon their approach towards the bridge, Capt. <HI>Lawrie's</HI> party fired upon them, killed Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and another man dead upon the &s;pot, and wounded &s;everal others. Upon this our <HI>militia</HI> ru&s;hed on, with a &s;pirit becoming <HI>free-born Americans,</HI> returned the fire upon the enemy, killed 2, wounded &s;everal and drove them from the bridge, and pur&s;ued them towards the town, 'till they were covered by a reinforcement from the main body. The provin|cials then took po&s;t on a hill, at &s;ome di&s;tance, north of the town: and as their numbers were continually increa&s;ing, they were preparing to give the troops a <HI>proper di&s;charge,</HI> on their departure from the town.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the king's troops collected; and having dre&s;&s;ed their wounded, de&s;troyed what &s;tores they could find, and in&s;ulted and plundered a number of the inhabitants, pre|pared for a retreat.</P>
<P>"While at <HI>Concord,</HI> the troops di&s;abled two 24 pounders; de&s;troyed their 2 carriages, and &s;even wheels for the &s;ame, with their limbers. Sixteen wheels for bra&s;s 3 pounders, and 2 carriages with limber and wheels for two 4 pounders. They threw into the river, wells, &amp;c. about 500 weight of ball: and &s;tove about 60 barrels of flour; but not having time to perfect their work, one half of the flour was afterwards &s;aved."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rev. Mr. Gordon's account.</NOTE></P>
<P>The troops began a ha&s;ty retreat about the middle of the day: and were no &s;ooner out of the town, but they began to meet the effects of the ju&s;t re&s;entments of this injured people. The pro|vincials fired upon them from various quarters, and pur&s;ued them (though without any military order) with a firmne&s;s and intrepidity, beyond what could have been expected, on the fir&s;t on&s;et, and in &s;uch a day of confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;The fire was returned, for a time, with great fury, by the troops as they
<PB N="7" REF="043231_0036_101CD9AF499F1E98">
retreated, though (through divine goodne&s;s) with but little ex|ecution.&mdash;This &s;cene continued, with but little intermi&s;&s;ion, till they returned to Lexington; when it was evident, that, having lo&s;t numbers in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners that fell into our hands, they began to be, not only fatigued, but greatly di&s;heartened. And it is &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t have &s;oon &s;urren|dered at di&s;cretion, had they not been reinforced.&mdash;But <HI>Lord Percy's</HI> arrival with another brigade, of about 1000 men, and 2 field pieces, about half a mile from Lexington <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> gave them a &s;ea&s;onable re&s;pite.</P>
<P>The coming of the reinforcement, with <HI>the cannon,</HI> (which our people were not &s;o well acquainted with then, as they have been &s;ince) put the provincials al&s;o to a pau&s;e, for a time.&mdash;But no &s;ooner were the <HI>king's troops</HI> in motion, but our men renewed the pur&s;uit with equal, and even greater ardor and intrepidity than before, and the firing on both &s;ides continued, with but little in|termi&s;&s;ion, to the clo&s;e of the day, when the troops entered <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> where the <HI>provincials</HI> could not follow them, with|out expo&s;ing the worthy inhabitants of that <HI>truly patriotic town,</HI> to their rage and revenge.&mdash;That night and the next day, they were conveyed in boats, over <HI>Charles-River</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> glad to &s;ecure them&s;elves, under the cover of the &s;hipping, and by &s;trengthning and perfecting the fortifications, at every part, again&s;t the further attacks of a ju&s;tly incen&s;ed people, who, up|on intelligence of the <HI>murderous tran&s;actions</HI> of this fatal day, were collecting in arms, round the town, in great numbers, and from every quarter.</P>
<P>In the retreat of the king's troops from <HI>Concord</HI> to <HI>Lexington,</HI> they ravaged and plundered, as they had opportunity, more or le&s;s, in mo&s;t of the hou&s;es that were upon the road.&mdash;But after they were joined by <HI>Piercy's brigade,</HI> in Lexington, it &s;eemed as if <HI>all the little remains</HI> of humanity had left them; and rage and revenge had taken the reins. and knew no bounds!&mdash;<HI>Cloathing, furniture, provi&s;ions, goods, plundered, broken, carried off, or de&s;troy|ed!&mdash;Buildings (e&s;pecially dwelling hou&s;es) abu&s;ed, defaced, battered, &s;hattered and almo&s;t ruined!&mdash;And as if this had not been enough, numbers of them doomed to the flames!&mdash;Three dwelling hou&s;es, two &s;hops and a barn, were laid in a&s;hes, in Lexington</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deacon Loring's hou&s;e and barn, Mrs. Lydia Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken's hou&s;e, and her &s;on's &s;hop, and Mr. Jo&s;hua Bond's hou&s;e and &s;hop.</NOTE>!&mdash;<HI>Many others were &s;et on fire, in this town, in Cambridge, &amp;c. and mu&s;t have &s;hared the &s;ame &s;ate, had not the clo&s;e pur&s;uit of the provincials pre|vented, and the flames been &s;ea&s;onably quenched!&mdash;Add to all this; the unarmed, the aged and infirm, who were unable to flee, are in|humanly &s;tabbed and murdered in their habitations!&mdash;Yea even wo|men in child-bed, with their helple&s;s babes in their arms, do not e&s;cape
