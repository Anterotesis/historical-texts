<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> democrats and I have long been in the friend|ly habit of making pre&s;ents to each other; and, this be|ing a &s;ea&s;on of the year when an interchange of civilities of this kind is more particularly looked for, I was ju&s;t turning about me for a &s;ubject that might &s;erve as &s;ome little mark of my attention, when the vindication of Mr. Randolph's re&s;ignation made its long-looked-for appear|ance.</P>
<P>If the reader knows any thing of the democrats, he will allow, that this vindication is mo&s;t eminently calcula|ted to furni&s;h me with the means of making them a grate|ful offering: and I was the more anxious to be prompt in the performance of this duty of etiquette, as, from their pre&s;ent formidable &s;ituation, it was to be feared, that they might have the will as well as the power to turn their vengeance again&s;t me, in ca&s;e of the &s;lighte&s;t neglect.</P>
<P>When we take a view of their affairs for a year pa&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to percieve that they are wonderfully improved. They have had addre&s;s &s;ufficient to &s;tir up the mob to burn the greate&s;t part of the Federal Senators

in effegy; they have dared publickly and vilely to tra|duce the Pre&s;ident of the United States; their own pre|&s;ident has been elected a member of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania; the legi&s;lature of Virginia has declared in their favour; and a fre&s;h importation of theives and traitors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Democratiad, page 13.</NOTE> from Ireland are daily expected to arrive. The&s;e are great and &s;olid advantages, and when we add to them the <HI>"precious confe&s;&s;ions,"</HI> which they may, by the help of <HI>"&s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars,"</HI> be able to draw from their new and <HI>communicative</HI> bro|ther, we cannot help regarding their club as the ri&s;ing &s;un of this country.</P>
<P>To this great luminary, then, I kneel; not to a&s;k a boon, but to offer one; and &s;uch a one as I hope will be acceptable, as its great object is to commemorate actions flowing from the pure&s;t principles of democracy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> NEW YEAR's GIFT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the means employed by the anarchi|cal A&s;&s;emblies of France, in the propagation of their dete&s;table principles, that of corruption may be re|garded as one of the mo&s;t powerful, and, accordingly, it has ever &s;hared a principal part of their attention. If we take a &s;urvey of their confi&s;cations, pro&s;crip|tions and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, from the &s;eizure of the pro|perty of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, by the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;em|bly, down to the horrid butcheries of Carrier, we &s;hall find that this has often been a leading motive for perpetrating of tho&s;e deeds, which will blacken the French name as long as hone&s;ty and humanity &s;hall be e&s;teemed among&s;t men. It is, at lea&s;t, an object of which they have never lo&s;t fight, and which they have &s;pared nothing to accompli&s;h. They have ran&s;acked the coffers of the rich, &s;tripped poverty of its very rags, robbed the infant of its birth-right, wrenched the crutch from the hand of tottering old age, and, joining &s;acrilege to burglary, have plun|dered even the altars of God, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the means of corrupting degenerate foreigners.</P>
<P>That their plans of &s;eduction have been but two &s;ucce&s;sful they them&s;elves avow. Like the gang of highwaymen in the &s;ubterraneous cave, each mounts
<PB N="6" REF="030215_0005_0FE523701C7C05D0">
the polluted tribune in his turn, and tells his tale of corruption. According to their own acknowledge|ments, they have expended millions upon millions in this commerce of con&s;ciences, &s;ince they have called their country a republic; and, which is well worthy of remark, the&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums have all been expended, with a trifling exception, in the republi|can &s;tates that have conde&s;cended to fraternize with them. The patriots of Geneva and Holland, of Ge|noa and Switzerland, have been bought with the trea&s;ures extorted from the unhappy French. The two former &s;tates are, in every political point of view, annihilated, and the two latter exi&s;t as a proof, that &s;tates as well as individuals may &s;ometimes triumph in &s;ucce&s;sful ba&s;ene&s;s and venality.</P>
<P>The people of the United States of America had not the mortification to &s;ee their country included in the dark catalogue; and, though it was evident to every di&s;cerning man, that &s;ome &s;uch influence began to prevail, in different parts of the Union, &s;oon after the arrival of Citizen Genet; though it was impo&s;&s;ible to account for the foundation of the Democratic Clubs, and for the countenance they received from many per&s;ons of weight and authority [particularly in the State of Penn&s;ylvania, where the &s;ecretary of the &s;tate was at the head of the Mo|ther Club] upon any other principle; though peo|ple were daily &s;een acting in direct oppo&s;ition to their apparant intere&s;ts; and though the partizans of France did not he&s;itate openly to declare their en|mity to the Pre&s;ident of the United States and to the government he had been cho&s;en to admini&s;ter; not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e &s;triking and well-known facts, the great body of the people would have regarded any one as a &s;landerer of their national character, who &s;hould have in&s;inuated, that the &s;ecrets of their government, and their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, were the price of that &s;udden exaltation that every
<PB N="7" REF="030215_0006_0FE523CEF0B26E40">
where appeared among the per&s;ons devoted to the will of the French mini&s;ter. The people might have re|mained in this delu&s;ive confidence, 'till their con|&s;titution had been &s;ubverted, and 'till they had been plunged into a calamitous foreign war, or driven to the dire nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hedding each other's blood, had it not been for the accidental interception of the letter, that has led to the <HI>Vindication</HI> on which I have here undertaken to make a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Before I enter on the Vindication it&s;elf, two cir|cum&s;tances pre&s;ent them&s;elves as &s;ubjects of prelimi|nary ob&s;ervation: the <HI>time,</HI> and the <HI>manner,</HI> of its being introduced to the public.</P>
<P>Mr. Randolph informs us, that he gave in his re&s;ignation on the 19th of Augu&s;t, in con&s;equence of his having been interrogated on the contents of an intercepted letter of the French mini&s;ter, Ci|tizen Fauchet; and we all know, that his Vindica|tion, if vindication it mu&s;t be, did not appear 'till the 18th of December; a &s;pace of exactly four months, wanting one day. When he had given in his re&s;ignation, he did not remain at Philadelphia to court the inquiry that he talks &s;o much of, but flew away to Rhode I&s;land, in order to overtake Mr. Fauchet, by who&s;e very letter he &s;tood accu&s;ed, and to obtain from him a certificate of his <HI>innocence</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI> We &s;hall &s;ee by and by how he was em|ployed during his &s;tay at Rhode I&s;land; at pre&s;ent we mu&s;t follow him back to Philadelphia, where we find him arrived on the 21&s;t of September, thirty three days after his departure, and writing to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, to inform him, that he is preparing his Vindication with all imaginable di&s;patch; and of this he had taken care to inform the public &s;everal days before. After this notifica|tion, it was impo&s;&s;ible that the people &s;hould not hourly expect to &s;ee, <HI>in the public papers,</HI> an elucida|tion of the whole affair. What then mu&s;t be their
<PB N="8" REF="030215_0007_0FE52362B71257C8">
a&s;toni&s;hment, when, after having waited with the utmo&s;t impatience for three long weeks, they were given to under&s;tand, that the boa&s;ting Vindicator could not clo&s;e his laborious performance, without having acce&s;s to certain other papers of a confiden|tial nature! The reque&s;t for the&s;e papers, all eva|&s;ive and malicious as it was, was at once granted by the Pre&s;ident. This pretended ob&s;tacle being remo|ved, one would have imagined that &s;hame would have prevented him from framing further delays; but, alas! &s;hame has but little power, when honour has de&s;erted the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Two months longer was the publication put off, and we now find it to contain no more original mat|ter than any man, accu&s;tomed to writing, would have prepared for the pre&s;s in the &s;pace &s;ix or &s;even days at mo&s;t. That the Vindicator has not amu&s;ed him&s;elf in poli&s;hing his &s;tyle, every one will allow that reads him. Be&s;ides, a man, who&s;e reputation is &s;u&s;pended, and who is con&s;cious of his innocence, does not wa&s;te his precious time in the pointing of a thought, or the rounding of a period. Truth needs no embelli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Vindicator's motives for this delay are not difficult to be divined. He wanted time to &s;pread reports to the prejudice of the Pre&s;ident, and to prepare the minds of the people in his own favour: hence the idle tales of a Briti&s;h faction, and hence the pitiful pleadings of the <HI>Calm Ob&s;erver.</HI> It was probable, too, that, by delaying the publication till after the meeting of congre&s;s, it might be brought out at a moment when &s;ome deci&s;ion of that body, re&s;pecting the Treaty, might irritate the feelings of the people again&s;t the pre&s;ident's conduct; and, by directing their attention to that part of the Vindica|tion intended to criminate him, might turn the &s;haft of their cen&s;ure from the Vindicator him&s;elf. Be|&s;ides, Mr. Randolph had not been &s;o a&s;&s;iduous a &s;tu|dier
<PB N="9" REF="030215_0008_0FE523D077FAB428">
of the temper of the multitude (for the multi|tude was all he could hope to deceive) to be igno|rant, that their minds, after being kept &s;o long on the &s;tretch, would begin to relax; and that indiffer|ence would &s;ucceed to curio&s;ity. In &s;hort, inde|pendent of every other con&s;ideration, to gain time, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, was with him a capital object. To this he was led by the motive common to all men in his &s;ituation: every one endeavours to put off the evil hour; and he ju&s;tly regarded the hour of the appearance of his Vindication, as that in which he would be &s;wung off into eternal ignominy.</P>
<P>However, whether any or all of the&s;e motives, were the real cau&s;e of the procra&s;tination, or not, is a matter of great indifference; I defy any one to account for it in a way compatible with his honour. He knew that he &s;tood accu&s;ed of a mo&s;t heinous offence again&s;t his country, and had he been con|fident, nay had he hoped, that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the te&s;timony of his innocence, he never would have witheld it &s;o long.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall we find, that the <HI>manner</HI> of his intro|ducing his Vindication to the public &s;peaks more in his favour.</P>
<P>In his letter of re&s;ignation, he &s;ays to the Pre&s;i|dent: <Q>I am &s;atisfied, Sir, that you will acknow|ledge one piece of ju&s;tice on this occa&s;ion, which is, that until an inquiry can be made, <HI>the affair &s;hall continue in &s;ecrecy under your injunction.</HI></Q> But, after his return from Rhode-I&s;land, knowing that the Pre&s;ident could not lay an injunction for the time pa&s;t, and knowing al&s;o, that a copy of the dreadful di&s;patch was in the hands of Mr. Bond, on whom the Pre&s;ident could lay no injunction at all, he &s;u&s;pected the affair had got abroad, which was, indeed, the ca&s;e; it was then, and not be|fore, that, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, he inform|ed
<PB N="10" REF="030215_0009_0FE5237D0BF5DFD8">
the public, by publi&s;hing a letter he had written to the Pre&s;ident, that he would prepare a Vindica|tion of his conduct.</P>
<P>After this he &s;uffered the matter to re&s;t for &s;ome time, and then publi&s;hed an extract from another letter to the Pre&s;ident, dated the 8th of October, in the following words: <Q>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that I am inevitably driven into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of many confidential and delicate points. I could with &s;afety immediately appeal to the people of the United States, who can be of no party. But I &s;hall wait for your an&s;wer to this letter, &s;o far as it re&s;|pects the paper de&s;ired, before I forward to you my general letter, which is delayed for no other cau&s;e. I &s;hall al&s;o rely that you will con&s;ent to the whole of this affair, how&s;oever confidential and delicate, being exhibited to the world.&mdash; At the &s;ame time I pre&s;cribe to my&s;elf this condi|tion, not to mingle any thing which I do not &s;in|cerely conceive to belong to the &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P>By this &s;troke our Vindicator imagined, he had reduced the Pre&s;ident to a dilemma, from which he would be unable to extricate him&s;elf. He thought that the Pre&s;ident's circum&s;pect di&s;po&s;ition would lead him to refu&s;e the communication of the paper demanded; and, in that ca&s;e, he would have im|pre&s;&s;ed on the public mind an idea of its containing &s;omething, at once capable of acquitting him&s;elf, and of criminating the Pre&s;ident. And, &s;hould the paper be granted, he hoped that he &s;hould be able to make &s;uch comments on it, as would, at lea&s;t, render the chief of the executive as odious as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident did not balance a moment on the cour&s;e he &s;hould take. "It is not difficult," &s;ays he in his an&s;wer, <Q>to perceive what your objects are; but that you may have no cau&s;e to complain of the withholding any paper (however private and
<PB N="11" REF="030215_0010_0FE523D1FA259AD8">
confidential), which you &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary in a ca&s;e of &s;o &s;erious a nature, I have directed that you &s;hould have the in&s;pection of my letter of the 22d of July, agreeably to your reque&s;t: and you are at full liberty to publi&s;h, without re&s;erve, <HI>any</HI> and <HI>every</HI> private and confidential letter I ever wrote you; nay more, every word I ever uttered to, or in your pre&s;ence, from whence you can derive any advantage in your ju&s;tification.</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry that the bounds, within which I pro|po&s;e to confine my&s;elf, do not permit me to give the reader the whole of this noble letter; here, howe|ver, is &s;ufficient to prove the generous deportment of the writer. The&s;e extracts mo&s;t eminently de|pict the minds of the parties: in one we hear the bold, the undaunted language of con&s;cious integri|ty, and, in the other, the faultering accents of guilt.</P>
<P>Baffled in this project of recrimination, the Vin|dicator had recour&s;e to others, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more unmanly. A paragraph appeared in the public pa|pers, as extracted from a Carolina gazette, telling us a &s;hocking tale about Mr. Randolph having been ill-treated by the Pre&s;ident, who had been worked up by a wicked Briti&s;h faction to accu&s;e him (from &s;omething that had been di&s;covered by an intercept|ed letter of Mr. Fauchet) of <HI>having his price,</HI> and that, in con&s;equence, poor Mr. Randolph had been <HI>&s;acrificed,</HI> merely, becau&s;e he had advi&s;ed the Pre&s;i|dent not to &s;ign the treaty with Great Britain. This &s;impleton of a &s;tory concluded with &s;ome patriotic reflections on the formidablene&s;s of the Briti&s;h fac|tion, and the great danger of acting contrary to their will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>After an infinity of other &s;ubterfuges and precau|tions, the Vindication it&s;elf comes forth; not in the face of day, like the hone&s;t innocent man from
<PB N="12" REF="030215_0011_0FE5237EE1102838">
his peaceful dwelling; but like the thief from his hiding place, preceded by his &s;kulking precur&s;ors. The&s;e numerous tricks and artifices have, however, all failed: the public has had the candour to pre|judge nothing: the thunder has been re&s;erved for the day of judgment.</P>
<P>Should the Vindicator be able to find &s;ome quib|ble to excu&s;e the&s;e preliminary manoeuvres, how will he ju&s;tify the <HI>&s;ale</HI> of his pretended Vindication? If it be not nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;tification of his con|duct, while in the &s;ervice of the public, why is it publi&s;hed? and, if it be, how dares he attempt to make them pay for it? He every where boa&s;ts of his pure republicani&s;m, and fawningly courts the fa|vour of the people, by calling on them to judge be|tween him and his patron, the Pre&s;ident. He pre|tends to have held his office from them, though eve|ry one knows that he held it from the Pre&s;ident, at who&s;e plea&s;ure he was removeable, and to whom a|lone he was, in this ca&s;e, accountable, But, allow him to hold his office from the people, it is to them he owes an account of his behaviour therein, and that <HI>gratis,</HI> too.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, by him, or by his printer (it is of little con&s;equence which), that he is to de|rive no pecuniary advantage from the <HI>&s;ale.</HI> But, what is this to the purcha&s;er? If he is obliged to pay two &s;hillings and nine pence three farthings for the Vindication, where is the difference to him, whe|ther Mr. Randolph or Mr. Smith pockets the mo|ney. Should it appear, at la&s;t, that the Vindicator is to &s;hare in the profits of the work, he will have the honour of introducing an improvement into the art of vindicating: men have often been known to barter their reputations; but to derive profit from a public &s;ale of the proofs of their having done &s;o, is as yet without an in&s;tance on the annals of corrup|tion. I will not, however, profe&s;s to believe that
<PB N="13" REF="030215_0012_0FE523DD8C244E90">
this is the ca&s;e: many rea&s;ons render it improbable. No; his grand object here, as every where el&s;e, was to narrow the circulation of the evidence again&s;t him. He has &s;o managed it as not only to make the public pay for what they had a right to demand information of without payment, but, by confining the copy-right to his friend Smith, he has re&s;erved to him&s;elf the power of limiting the number of co|pies; and, it is very probable, that the Vindication may be out of print in le&s;s than a month. Special care has been taken to place at the head of the book the in&s;trument by which all others are forbidden to print it, and an extract from the act of congre&s;s, made <Q>for the encouragement of <HI>learning,</HI> by &s;e|curing the copies, &amp;c.</Q> This is a fair menace; as if he had &s;aid: <HI>Here is my vindication; but if any one dares to re-publi&s;h it, I will pro&s;ecute him according to law.</HI>&mdash;God of republicani&s;m! if there be &s;uch a deity, could it ever be imagined, that a law, made in a country that &s;eems to be the receptacle of all the patriots upon the face of the earth, for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of encouraging learning, and enlightening the people, would have been made a handle of to keep them in darkne&s;s and ignorance, concerning crimes of the mo&s;t momentous nature, imputed to tho&s;e who pretend to glory in being called public &s;er|vants!</P>
<P>Had Mr. Randolph been &s;incere in his de&s;ire to appeal to the people, he would have endeavoured to make that appeal as general as po&s;&s;ible; and what, I a&s;k, would have pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him as the mo&s;t likely mean of effecting this? Would he not have &s;ent a copy of it to a printer of a gazette, re|que&s;ting at the &s;ame time all the other printers of gazettes, in the United States, to re-publi&s;h it? This was the method practi&s;ed with re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h depredations, and all the other little &s;piteful &s;tories of the &s;ame &s;ort, and we know that it has ever met
<PB N="14" REF="030215_0013_0FE5238069B97520">
with the wi&s;hed-for &s;ucce&s;s. Why was it not, then, adopted on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion? Mr. Randolph's friends &s;ay (for, a&s;toni&s;hing as it may &s;eem, friends he has) that, by a new&s;paper publication, it would have appeared in a mutilated, incomplete &s;tate. To this I reply; that, had he &s;ent his copy to his ga|zetteer, Mr. Brown, we &s;hould have had every line of it in the Philadelphia Gazette at one time; or, at lea&s;t, we &s;hould have had a right to expect it; for, the trial of <HI>Hardy,</HI> which my old friend Brown publi&s;hed about a year ago, to prove to us that the Briti&s;h government was ju&s;t that minute going to pieces like an old crazy hulk, contained much more matter than the work of our Vindicator. It is very true, that Mr. Brown might not have imagined that <HI>his cu&s;tomers</HI> were &s;o nearly intere&s;ted in the <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of the ex-&s;ecretary of &s;tate, as in the fate of a &s;editious cobler at London; more e&s;pe|cially as the former might not be thought extremely honourable to republicani&s;m: yet, there can be but little doubt but he would have complied; for, as to the reputation of his paper it could be in no dan|ger even from the in&s;ertion of the vindication, af|ter the non&s;en&s;e, the fal&s;hoods, the bla&s;phemies, and the bawdry, of which it has &s;o long been the vehicle. By only &s;ending it, then, to the pre&s;s of this indu&s;trious, vulgar, and voluminous <HI>quid nunc,</HI> two or three thou&s;and copies of it would have been di&s;tributed through the dark lanes and alleys of Philadelphia in the &s;pace of forty-eight hours: we &s;hould have met with it in every direction, and in every &s;hape that inanimate nature can a&s;&s;ume: not a garret, not a reeking &s;tove-hole, would have been without a copy: the windows of Paddy's filthy cab|bin, and even the crannies of citizen Pompey's hovel, might have exhibited as clear and undenia|ble proofs of Mr. Randolph's innocence as the French archives.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030215_0014_0FE523E0258FE010">This would have been the way for the vindica|tor to throw him&s;elf on the &s;overeign people in|deed. But, in&s;tead of this, what has he done? He has barricaded him&s;elf in by an act of Congre&s;s, and forbidden his &s;overeigns to approach him without money in their hands. Ye gods! is he ever to have his price! is he ever to be purcha&s;ed? And yet this is the man who pretends to be the friend of <HI>pure republicani&s;m,</HI> and the advocate for the &s;overeignty of the people! <Q>Without fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her enumeration," &s;ays he, "of rea&s;ons for an ap|peal to the <HI>people,</HI> to whom el&s;e ought I to ap|peal?

Why hide his <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> from their &s;ight? Why attempt to keep them in the dark by impo&s;ing a tax on their curio&s;ity and inquiries?

<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the&s;e circum&s;tances, which, though but trifles, if compared with many others that we &s;hall meet with, were too glaring to pa&s;s unnoticed, I now come to the Vindication it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Randolph begins by a "&s;tatement of facts," and in this I &s;hall imitate him; but as to the man|ner of doing this we &s;hall differ widely. He has endeavoured to lo&s;e us in a maze of letters and
<PB N="16" REF="030215_0015_0FE52381EFCE4030">
an&s;wers, and extracts and conver&s;ations, and notes, and memorials, and certificates; but, as it is not my intention to render what I have to &s;ay unin|telligible, nor weary my reader's patience with a round about &s;tory, I &s;hall endeavour to be as con|ci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t of October, 1794, Citizen Fauchet, the then French mini&s;ter at Philadelphia, di&s;patch|ed a letter to a committee of the government in France, informing them among other things, of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the in&s;urrection in the We&s;t|ern counties of Penn&s;ylvania. This letter was put on board the Jean Bart, a French corvette, which &s;ailed directly afterwards for France, and, on her pa&s;&s;age, took an Engli&s;h merchant ve&s;&s;el. When the corvette arrived in the Briti&s;h Channel, &s;he was brought to by a frigate of the enemy. As &s;oon as the commander of the former &s;aw that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, he brought the di&s;patches, and Ci|tizen Fauchet's letter among the re&s;t, upon the deck and threw them over board. But unfortunately for Mr. Randolph, and &s;ome other patriots that we &s;hall &s;ee mentioned by-and-by, there was a man on board who had the pre&s;ence of mind and the cou|rage to jump into the &s;ea and &s;ave them. The reader will not be a&s;toni&s;hed at this heroic act, at this proof of unfeigned and <HI>unbought</HI> patrioti&s;m, when I tell him that the man was no &s;ans-culotte <HI>citizen,</HI> but a Briti&s;h Tar. It was, indeed, no other than the captain of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el that the cor|vette had taken on her pa&s;&s;age. This good fellow and the di&s;patches he had &s;o gallantly pre&s;erved, were taken up by the frigate's boat: the di&s;patches were, of cour&s;e, &s;ent to the Briti&s;h government, by whom Citizen Fauchet's letter was, through Mr. Hammond, communicated to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. The Pre&s;ident &s;howed it to Mr. Randolph, de&s;iring him to make &s;uch explanations
<PB N="17" REF="030215_0016_0FE523E1A858B470">
as he cho&s;e; and Mr. Randolph tells us, that it was in con&s;equence of what pa&s;&s;ed at this interview that he gave in the re&s;ignation, of which he has &s;ince publi&s;hed a Vindication.</P>
<P>Although this extraordinary performance is cal|led <Q>A Vindication of Mr. Randolph's <HI>Re&s;igna|tion,</HI></Q> people naturally look upon it as an attempt to vindicate his <HI>conduct,</HI> previous to that re&s;igna|tion. Few per&s;ons, I will take it upon me to &s;ay, thought an apology for quitting his po&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e who had read his bungling corre&s;pondencies, never imagined him to be the Atlas of the &s;tate. It was not, then, his re&s;ignation that excited public anxiety or public curio&s;ity, but a certain &s;omething between him and Citizen Fauchet. The people had heard about corruption, about thou&s;ands of dollars, and about the pretended patriots of Ame|rica having their prices; the&s;e were the points the people wanted to &s;ee cleared up. They could not conceive that expo&s;ing to the whole world, and con&s;equently to the enemies of this country, their Pre&s;ident's private letters of July, 1795, relative to the treaty, could po&s;&s;ibly tend to invalidate the charges of trea&s;on, contained in the French mini|&s;ter's letter, written in the month of October, 1794. But Mr. Randolph, it appears, &s;aw the matter in another light. He has thought proper to attempt to balance the crime laid to his charge, again&s;t another &s;uppo&s;ed crime, which he imputes to the Pre&s;ident, concerning the ratification of the treaty.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the Vindicator labours at two principal objects: to wa&s;h away the &s;tain on his own reputation, and to repre&s;ent the Pre&s;ident of the United States as ratifying the treaty under the influence of a Briti&s;h faction. That the latter of the&s;e can, as I have already ob&s;erved, have no &s;ort of relation to the great and important point, to|wards
<PB N="18" REF="030215_0017_0FE5238EE50E9668">
which the public mind has been &s;o long di|rected, is very manife&s;t; neverthele&s;s, &s;ince it has been forced upon us, it would look like flinching from the inquiry to pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence. I &s;hall, therefore, after having ob&s;erved on that part of the Vindication which comprehends what ought to have been its only object, endeavour to place in as fair a light as po&s;&s;ible the indirect charge that is brought again&s;t the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>From Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter it ap|pears, that Mr. Randolph did betray to him the &s;ecrets of the American government, and make him overtures for money, to be applied to &s;ome purpo&s;e relative to the in&s;urrection in the We&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is fully &s;et forth in the very fir&s;t paragraph of the letter, which runs thus: <Q>The mea&s;ures which prudence pre&s;cribes to me to take, with re&s;pect to my colleagues, have &s;till pre&s;ided in the dige&s;ting of the di&s;patches &s;igned by them, which treat of the in&s;urrection of the We&s;tern counties, and of the repre&s;&s;ive means adopted by the government. I have allowed them to be confined to the giving of a faithful, but naked recital of events, the reflections therein contain|ed &s;carcely exceed the conclu&s;ions ea&s;ily deduci|ble from the character a&s;&s;umed by the public prints. I have re&s;erved my&s;elf to give you as far as I am able, a key to the facts detailed in our reports. When it comes in que&s;tion to explain either by conjectures or by certain data, <HI>the &s;e|cret views of a foreign government,</HI> it would be imprudent to run the ri&s;k of indi&s;cretions, and to give one&s;elf up to men, who&s;e known <HI>partiality for that government,</HI> and &s;imilitude of pa&s;&s;ions and in|tere&s;ts with its chiefs, might lead to confidences, the i&s;&s;ue of which are incalculable.

<P>The phra&s;e of the fir&s;t paragraph of Citizen Fau|chet's letter, which more immediately attracts our attention, is, <Q>the <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of Mr. Ran|dolph.</Q> The&s;e words the Vindicator has taken a deal of pains to explain away, and with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. He begins by &s;aying, that, <Q>this ob&s;er|vation upon the <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of Mr. Ran|dolph, involves the <HI>judicious management of the of|fice.</HI> It implies no deliberate impropriety, and <HI>cannot be particularly an&s;wered,</HI> until particular in&s;tances are cited.</Q> I &s;ee nothing here from which we are to form a conclu&s;ion to his honour; nor did he, it &s;eems; for he immediately throws

the ta&s;k on Citizen Fauchet's <HI>certificate.</HI> This extra diplomatic in&s;trument was obtained by the famous journey to Rhode I&s;land, under what circum&s;tances we &s;hall &s;ee by-and-by; at pre&s;ent let us hear what Citizen Fauchet &s;ays in it. <Q>As to the commu|nications which he [Mr. Randolph] has made to me at different times, they were only of <HI>opinions,</HI> the greater part, if not the whole of which I have heard <HI>circulated as opinions.</HI>&mdash;I will ob&s;erve here, that none of his conver&s;ations with me conclu|ded without his giving me the idea, that the Pre&s;i|dent was a man of integrity, and a &s;incere friend to France. This explains <HI>in part</HI> [well put in] what I meant by the terms his <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions.</HI> &mdash;When I &s;peak in the &s;ame paragraph in the&s;e words: "Be&s;ides the precious confe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Randolph alone ca&s;t upon all which happens a &s;atisfactory light," I have &s;till in view only the explanations of which I have &s;poken above; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that very often I have taken for <HI>confe&s;&s;ions,</HI> what he <HI>might have</HI> communicated to me by virtue of a &s;ecret authority.

<P>Without admitting, even for a &s;ingle moment, the validity of the evidence of this certificate, we may be permitted to admire its effrontery. <HI>Precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> are here explained to &s;ignify <HI>opinions,</HI> and opinions, too, that were <HI>the &s;ubject of public conver|&s;ation!</HI> Oh! mon&s;trous!

What idea do the words <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> convey to our minds?
<PB N="21" REF="030215_0020_0FE523EFB373FB58">
What is a confe&s;&s;ion?&mdash;An <HI>acknowledgement</HI> which &s;ome one is <HI>prevailed on</HI> to make.

<P>But, let us &s;ee in what &s;en&s;e Citizen Fauchet employs the &s;ame word <HI>precious,</HI> in another place, even in the very certificate where he endeavours to explain it to mean nothing.&mdash;After &s;peaking of the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> machinations of Mr. Hammond, the con|&s;pirations of the Engli&s;h, and their being at the bottom of the We&s;tern in&s;urrection, he comes to the means that Mr. Randolph had propo&s;ed to get at their <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> and &s;ays: <Q>I was a&s;toni&s;hed that the government it&s;elf did not procure for it&s;elf <HI>information &s;o precious.</HI></Q> Here, then, <HI>pre|cious</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>&s;ecret.</HI> This <HI>information &s;o precious</HI> was <HI>rare</HI> information; information <HI>not to be come at with|out a bribe.</HI> This phra&s;e, fallen from the pen of Citizen Fauchet, while his invention was upon the rack to explain away another charge again&s;t the moral Mr. Randolph, fully proves in what &s;en&s;e he had ever u&s;ed the word <HI>precious.</HI></P>
<P>However, we &s;hould be very far from doing ju&s;|tice to the&s;e <HI>"precious confe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Randolph"</HI> by con&s;idering them in their naked independent &s;en&s;e. It is very rarely that the true meaning of any phra&s;e, or even of a complete &s;entence is to be come at without taking in the context. That the&s;e <HI>preci|ous

confe&s;&s;ions</HI> were neither &s;o trifling nor of &s;o pub|lick a nature, as the citizen would make us believe, is clear from the tenor of the whole fir&s;t paragraph above tran&s;cribed, which Mr. Randolph forgot to beg his friend to explain. After having mentioned the precious confe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Randolph, <HI>"the&s;e,"</HI> &s;ays he, <Q>I have not yet communicated to my col|leagues.

Why was this cautious <HI>re&s;erve</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, even towards his col|leagues of the legation, if there was nothing to com|municate but mere <HI>"opinions,"</HI> that were <Q>the &s;ub|ject of public conver&s;ation?</Q> What an over-and-above clo&s;e man this mu&s;t have been! Would to God Mr. Randolph had been as clo&s;e! But what were the&s;e "motives already mentioned?" We mu&s;t con&s;ult the paragraph again here. The Citi|zen, after &s;tating that he allowed the di&s;patches, &s;igned by his colleagues, to be confined to a naked recital of events, <HI>&s;carcely exceeding</HI> what might be gathered from the news-papers, ob&s;erves, that he has re&s;erved to him&s;elf the ta&s;k of giving a key to the&s;e joint reports, and adds: <Q>when it comes in que&s;tion to explain the <HI>&s;ecret views</HI> of a foreign government, it would be imprudent <HI>to give one&s;elf up</HI> to men, who&s;e known <HI>partiality for that govern|ment,</HI> and &s;imilitude of pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts with its chiefs, might lead to <HI>confidencies,</HI> the i&s;&s;ue of which is incalculable.</Q>&mdash;Here we have the mo|tives that prevented Citizen Fauchet from commu|nicating the precious confe&s;&s;ions to his colleagues. Ordinary information, <HI>hardly exceeding</HI> what was to be learnt from the gazettes, he &s;uffered them to par|ticipate; but as to the <HI>&s;ecret views</HI> of the govern|ment, and the <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Randolph,</HI> he kept them in his own brea&s;t; becau&s;e his col|leagues

were men <Q>who had a known <HI>partiality for the government,</HI> and a &s;imilitude of pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts with its chiefs!</Q> This rea&s;on for not tru&s;ting the colleagues of Citizen Fauchet is corro|borated by a &s;entence of Mr. Randolph him&s;elf, who certainly forgot what he was about when he wrote it. <Q>Two per&s;ons, &s;ays he, were in commi&s;&s;ion with Mr. Fauchet, and it was &s;u&s;|pected, <HI>from a quarter in which I confided,</HI> that the&s;e per&s;ons were in a political <HI>intimacy with members of our government,</HI> not friendly to me.</Q> I am &s;ure the reader will agree with me, that this was a rea|&s;on, and a &s;ub&s;tantial one too, for not communicating to them the precious confe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Randolph, if tho&s;e confe&s;&s;ions went to expo&s;e the &s;ecret views of the government; but, if, on the contrary, they went no further than <HI>"opinions,"</HI> that were <Q>the &s;ubject of public conver&s;ation,</Q> the precaution was per|fectly ridiculous. It was like the &s;ecret of the ideot, who, whi&s;pering a by-&s;tander, told him the &s;un &s;hined, but begged him to let it go no further.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all the parts of this account corre&s;pond &s;o exactly, that they only want to amount to a proof of innocence in&s;tead of guilt to render them a &s;ub|ject of plea&s;ing contemplation. Citizen Fauchet re|ceives certain <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> from Mr. Randolph, which he keeps from his colleagues, becau&s;e they have <HI>a partiality for the government,</HI> and becau&s;e, from their intimacy with &s;ome of the members of it, they might make dangerous di&s;coveries. The inevitable conclu&s;ion, then, is, that the&s;e <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> were <HI>not</HI> of <HI>opinions,</HI> that were <HI>the &s;ubject of public conver&s;ation,</HI> and that they were of a nature <HI>ho&s;tile to the government;</HI> and whether this be <Q>a conclu&s;ion honourable</Q> to Mr. Randolph, or not, I leave the reader to determine.</P>
<P>Citizen Fauchet, in that part of his certificate which I have above quoted, makes an indirect at|tempt
<PB N="24" REF="030215_0023_0FE52393782C7E40">
to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief, that Mr. Randolph, in his confe&s;&s;ions, never uttered any thing to the pre|judice of the character of the Pre&s;ident of the Uni|ted States. This is his aim, when he &s;ays that <Q>none of his conver&s;ations concluded without giv|ing the idea, that the Pre&s;ident was a man of in|tegrity.</Q> But, we are to ob&s;erve, that the cer|tificate was originally intended for the peru&s;al of the Pre&s;ident. Who could tell how far &s;uch a declara|tion, if it &s;hould be believed, might go towards making Mr. Randolph's peace? It has never yet ap|peared, that he was in earne&s;t about a <HI>public</HI> Vindi|cation, 'till after his return from Rhode I&s;land; that is, 'till he &s;aw that it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to &s;mother the affair. To have brought this declara|tion into the certificate with any other view than that of &s;oftening the Pre&s;ident, would have been pure folly. The Pre&s;ident being a man of incor|ruptible integrity was &s;urely no precious confe&s;&s;ion; on the contrary, I am mi&s;taken if it was not among the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable information that Citizen Fau|chet ever received from his friend, the Secretary. If this certificate had, then, been intended for the public, to what purpo&s;e was the declaration con|cerning the Pre&s;ident thru&s;ted into it? Did the fra|mer, or rather framers, of it imagine; nay, could they po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that Mr. Randolph would acquire favour with the people for having declared that the man he now attempts to blacken, the man he now repre&s;ents as under the guidance of a Bri|ti&s;h faction, is a man of incorruptible integrity? The Pre&s;ident's character &s;tood in no need of the eu|logy of Mr. Randolph, or the certificate of a mu&s;h|roon French mini&s;ter. The people of the United States knew General Wa&s;hington to be a man of integrity, long before Citizen Fauchet was called from among a troop of itinerant play-actors, to

<P>The de&s;perate Vindicator makes one &s;truggle more. He endeavours to back the evidence of Ci|tizen Fauchet's certificate with a prote&s;tation of his own, in which he denies ever having received a far|thing for the communication of &s;tate-&s;ecrets; &s;ays that he never communicated any &s;uch &s;ecrets; that he never uttered a &s;yllable which violated the duties of office; all which, adds he, <Q>I <HI>a&s;&s;ert,</HI> and to the a&s;&s;ertion, I am ready to &s;uperadd the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn &s;anction.</Q> I &s;hall not throw away my time in attempting to invalidate this kind of te&s;timony. There was a time when the <HI>&s;olemn &s;anction,</HI> or even bare <HI>a&s;&s;ertion,</HI> of Mr. Randolph, might have been formidable; but that time is, alas! no more.</P>
<P>We now come to the <HI>overtures for money,</HI> to be applied to &s;ome purpo&s;e relative to the in&s;urrection in the We&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Citizen Fauchet, in the 15th paragraph of the fatal letter, had been &s;peaking of the a&s;&s;embling of the in&s;urgents in Braddock's Field, and of the preparations of the Federal government to reduce them to order and obedience. Then, in the 16th paragraph, he comes to &s;peak of the conduct of certain per&s;ons in power, at this momentous cri&s;is. <Q>In the mean time, &s;ays he, although there was a certainty of having an army, yet it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of co-operators a|mong the men who&s;e patriotic reputation might

influence their party, and who&s;e lukewarmne&s;s or want of energy in the exi&s;ting conjunctures might compromit the &s;ucce&s;s of the plans. Of all the governors who&s;e duty it was to appear at the head of the requi&s;itions, the <HI>governor of Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> alone enjoyed the name of <HI>republican;</HI> his opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and of his &s;y&s;tems, was known to be unfavourable. The <HI>Secretary of this State</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great influence in the <HI>popular &s;ociety of Philadelphia,</HI> which in its turn influenced tho&s;e of other States; of cour&s;e he merited attention. It appears therefore that <HI>the&s;e men,</HI> with others unknown to me, all hav|ing without doubt Randolph at their head, were <HI>balancing to decide on their party.</HI> Two or three days before the proclamation was publi&s;hed, and of cour&s;e before the cabinet had re&s;olved on its mea&s;ures, Mr. Randolph came to me with an air of great eagerne&s;s, and made me <HI>the overtures</HI> of which I have given you an account in No. 6. Thus, <HI>with &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars,</HI> the Repub|lic could have decided <HI>on civil war or on peace!</HI> Thus, the con&s;ciences of the pretended patriots of America have already their prices!

<P>From this paragraph we learn, that certain men of weight and influence were balancing as to the &s;ide they &s;hould take at the time of the in&s;urrection; that two or three days before the i&s;&s;uing of the proclama|tion for the a&s;&s;embling of a military force to march a|gain&s;t the in&s;urg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, Mr. Randolph went to Citizen Fauchet, and made to him certaine vertures; and that, from the nature of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e overtures, Citizen Fauchet concluded, that, if he had had &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars at his di&s;po&s;al, he could have decided on ci|vil

From this latter circum&s;tance, it is evident that the overtures were for money, to be applied to &s;ome purpo&s;e relative to the in&s;urrec|tion; and, therefore, our inquiries (if, indeed, in|quiries are at all nece&s;&s;ary), are naturally confined to two que&s;tions: <HI>who</HI> was to receive this money? and for <HI>what purpo&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;horte&s;t way of determining the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions, is, to re&s;ort to the fair and unequivocal meaning of the paragraph it&s;elf. Suppo&s;e the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age of it alone had come to light: <Q><HI>the&s;e men,</HI> with others unknown to me, all having without doubt Randolph at their head, <HI>were ba|lancing</HI> to decide on their party. Two or three days before the proclamation was publi&s;hed, Mr. Randolph came to me with an air of great eager|ne&s;s, and made to me the overtures of which I have given you an account in my No. 6. Thus, with &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars, the Republic could have determined on civil war or on peace.</Q> Suppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that of all the letter, this pa&s;&s;age a|lone had been found; what &s;hould we have wanted to know further?&mdash;Why, certainly, <HI>who the&s;e men were.</HI> This is what we &s;hould have cur&s;ed our &s;tars for having kept from us.&mdash;Randolph, we &s;hould have &s;aid, is at the head of them; but who are <HI>the&s;e men?</HI> To whom do the&s;e important words re|fer?&mdash;Luckily, Citizen Fauchet's letter leaves us nothing to wi&s;h for on this head: the&s;e words are relative to <HI>"the governor of Penn&s;ylvania,"</HI> the <HI>"Se|cretary of this State</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I keep to the very words of the letter; but that, by "this State," is meant the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania cannot be doubted, e&s;pecially when we &s;ee that the letter is dated at Philadelphia.</NOTE>", and other per&s;ons unknown to the writer. <HI>The&s;e men,</HI> according to Citizen Fau|chet's

letter, were, with Randolph at their head, balancing to decide on their party; and, while they were thus balancing, Mr. Randolph, being the leader, went to Citizen Fauchet, and made him &s;uch overtures as would have enabled him, had he had "&s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars," to decide on ci|vil war or on peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not amu&s;e my&s;elf with drawing conclu&s;ions here, as I am fully per&s;uaded, that no one, who &s;hall do me the honour of reading the&s;e &s;heets, will find any difficulty in doing it for him&s;elf. It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to notice what has been advanced with an intention of doing away the impre&s;&s;ion, that this part of Citizen Fauchet's letter mu&s;t inevitably leave on our minds, with re&s;pect to the per&s;ons in who&s;e behalf the money overtures were made.</P>
<P>The reader has ob&s;erved that Citizen Fauchet mentions a di&s;patch, which he calls his No. 6. and to which he refers his government for the particulars of Mr. Randolph's overtures. An <HI>extract</HI> from this No. 6. the Vindicator has obtained from Citi|zen Ade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the pre&s;ent French mini&s;ter, which he has publi&s;hed in his Vindication, and which I here in&s;ert. <Q>Scarce was the commotion known, when the Secretary of State came to my hou&s;e. All his countenance was grief. He reque&s;ted of me a private conver&s;ation. It is all over, he &s;aid to me. A civil war is about to ravage our unhappy country. <HI>Four men,</HI> by their <HI>talents,</HI> their <HI>influence</HI> and their <HI>energy,</HI> may &s;ave it. But, debtors of Engli&s;h merchants, they will be deprived of their liberty, if they take the &s;malle&s;t &s;tep. Could you lend them in&s;tantaneou&s;ly funds, &s;ufficient to &s;helter them from Engli&s;h per&s;ecution? This in|quiry <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed</HI> me much. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to make a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. You know <HI>my want of power,</HI> and my defect of <HI>pecuniary means.</HI> I &s;hall draw my&s;elf off from the affair by &s;ome

common-place remarks, and by throwing my&s;elf on the <HI>pure</HI> and unalterable principles of the Re|public.</Q>&mdash;God of Heaven! what mu&s;t be the &s;itu|ation of a man, who publi&s;hes &s;uch a piece as this in order to weaken the evidence again&s;t him!</P>
<P>We &s;hould certainly be at full liberty to reject the te&s;timony contained in this extract; not on ac|count of the per&s;on who &s;igns it (though his <HI>not being a Chri&s;tian</HI> might, with &s;ome weak minded people, be a weighty objection), but on account of its being but <HI>a part</HI> of the No. 6. referred to. I do not, however, wi&s;h to derive any advantage from this circum&s;tance: I admit the validity of the te&s;timony contained in the extract; and well I may; for, the greate&s;t enemy of Mr. Randolph, and of tho&s;e who are involved with him, could wi&s;h for no better confirmation of the 16th paragraph of Citi|zen Fauchet's letter.</P>
<P>The only circum&s;tance in which the extract from No. 6. appears to differ from the letter, is, that, in the extract, mention is made of <HI>four</HI> men, and, in the letter, of only <HI>three.</HI> But, let it be ob&s;erv|ed, that though only three per&s;ons are named in the letter, yet Citizen Fauchet adds to them, <Q>others unknown to me.</Q></P>
<P>The next piece of exculpatory evidence produ|ced, is the <HI>certificate</HI> of Citizen Fauchet. But, be|fore we quote this paper again, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee how it was obtained.</P>
<P>When Citizen Fauchet's letter was fir&s;t &s;hewn to Mr. Randolph, in the council-chamber, and he was a&s;ked to explain it, he he&s;itated; de&s;ired time to commit his remarks to writing; went to his office, locked up his own appartment there, and gave the key to the me&s;&s;enger; then went home, from whence he wrote to the Pre&s;ident, reque&s;ting a co|py of the letter, and informing him that, if Citi|zen Fauchet had not quitted the continent, he would
<PB N="30" REF="030215_0029_0FE523A0F01AF8D0">
go after him, <HI>to prepare him&s;elf for an inquiry.</HI>&mdash; Was this the behaviour of a man gro&s;sly calumnia|ted? Such a man would have &s;aid: I &s;ee, Sir, by this letter, that I am charged with crimes which my heart abhors; I declare the writer to be an in|famous &s;landerer; but, as appearances are again&s;t me, here are the keys of my office, and even of my private papers: examine them all, and I will re|main here till the examination is ended. Send al&s;o for Citizen Fauchet, if he be yet in the country: bring him here, and let him avow this to my face if he dares.&mdash;I appeal to the reader's brea&s;t, whe|ther there is any thing that a man, &s;trong in his in|tegrity, would have &s;o ardently de&s;ired, as to be confronted with his accu&s;er; or any thing he would have &s;o ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed as to be the me&s;&s;enger to &s;eek him? Allowing, however, that a man, fal&s;ly accu&s;ed of &s;uch heinous crimes, had, in a paroxy&s;m of rage, quitted the Council-chamber to pur&s;ue the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his reputation; would he not have in|&s;tantly departed? Would he have clo&s;ed his eyes till he came up with him? Would any mortal means of conveyance have been &s;wift enough for his pur|&s;uit? And, once arrived, would he not have ru&s;h|ed into his pre&s;ence? Would not the &s;ight of the perfidious mi&s;creant have almo&s;t driven him to mad|ne&s;s? Had he found him in the arms of his harlot, or grovelling at the altar of his pagan gods, would he not have dragged him forth to cha&s;ti&s;ement? The heart that &s;wells with injured innocence, is deaf to the voice of di&s;cretion!</P>
<P>How different from all this was the cool, and gentle and genteel deportment of the Vindicator! He &s;tays, very quietly, two days at Philadelphia, before his de|parture for Rhode-I&s;land, and loiters away no le&s;s than <HI>ten days</HI> in performing a journey that the common &s;tages perform in <HI>five.</HI> When he arrives, he goes and

has a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with Citizen Fauchet, and &s;o mild and &s;o complai&s;ant is he, and &s;o little malice does he bear on account of the wound given to his ho|nour, that he afterwards writes the Citizen a note, in which he &s;tyles him&s;elf his <HI>humble &s;ervant.</HI> In con&s;equence of this <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> in which the Citizen and Secretary re-examined the fatal letter, and re|fre&s;hed each other's memories, a certificate was made out by the former; but not delivered into Mr. Randolph's hands, for fear we &s;hould believe that he had penned it as well as furni&s;hed the hints for it, till after his return to Philadelphia, when it was &s;ent to him by Citizen Adet. This <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> on the unfortunate letter re&s;embles the con&s;ultation of a couple of phy&s;icians over a patient ga&s;ping in a de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;e: they at la&s;t pre&s;cribe a remedy, and, phy&s;ician like, leave it to be admini&s;tered by their Apothecary.</P>

Each day of the republican year is con&s;ecrated to &s;ome one of the&s;e their animal and vegetable &s;aints, and it is a circum|&s;tance truly &s;ingular, that the day, on which Citizen Fau|chet was to be cro&s;s-examined, is con&s;ecrated to <HI>Hemp.</HI>&mdash; There is &s;omething like fatality in this.&mdash;Should any one wi&s;h to &s;atisfy him&s;elf of the fact, he has only to look in one of the Calendars, printed in France, for the month of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndemaire,</HI> a copy of which I have now before</NOTE>?</P>
<P>After the&s;e remarks on the manner in which this certificate, which we are called upon to give credit to, was procured, we may venture to quote it, without running the ri&s;k of being mi&s;led by its pro|te&s;tations. Let us, then, hear what it &s;ays with re&s;pect to the per&s;ons in who&s;e behalf the overtures for money were made. <Q>About the month of Ju|ly or Augu&s;t, in the la&s;t year, he [Mr. Randolph] came to &s;ee me [Citizen Fauchet], at my hou&s;e. We had a private conver&s;ation of about twenty minutes. His countenance be&s;poke di&s;tre&s;s. He &s;aid to me that he was afraid a civil war would &s;oon ravage America. I enquired of him what new information was procured. He &s;aid that he began to believe that in fact the Engli&s;h were fo|menting the in&s;urrection, and that he did not doubt, that Mr. Hammond and his Congre&s;s would pu&s;h &s;ome mea&s;ures with re&s;pect to the in|&s;urrection, with an intention of giving embarra&s;s|ment to the United States. He demanded of me, if, as my Republic was it&s;elf intere&s;ted in the&s;e manoeuvres, I could not by the means of &s;ome cor|re&s;pondents procure &s;ome information of what
<PB N="33" REF="030215_0032_0FE5240592FC8CC8">
was pa&s;&s;ing. I an&s;wered him that I believed I could. He replied upon this, that having formed many connections by the means of flour contracts, <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> per&s;ons, among the different <HI>con|tractors,</HI> might, by <HI>talents, energy,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>in|fluence,</HI> procure the nece&s;&s;ary information and &s;ave America from a civil war, by proving that England interfered in the troubles of the We&s;t.</Q> After this, the certificate &s;ays, that Mr. Randolph &s;tated a doubt as to the pecuniary affairs of the&s;e contractors, and ob&s;erved that tho&s;e whom Citizen Fauchet <Q><HI>might be able</HI> to employ, <HI>might perhaps</HI> be debtors of Engli&s;h merchants; and that, in that ca&s;e, <HI>might perhaps</HI> be expo&s;ed to be harra&s;&s;ed and arre&s;ted; and, therefore, he a&s;ked if the payment of the &s;ums, <HI>due them</HI> by virtue of the exi&s;ting contracts, would not be &s;ufficiently early to ren|der them independent of Briti&s;h per&s;ecution.</Q></P>
<P>So! here are all <Q><HI>the&s;e men</HI> who were <HI>balancing to decide</HI> on their <HI>party;</HI> the&s;e men, who by their <HI>talents, influence,</HI> and <HI>energy</HI> might &s;ave the coun|try;</Q> the&s;e men, <HI>who could have decided on civil war or on peace,</HI> are, by this barefaced certificate, turned into indu&s;trious peaceable flour-merchants! This explanation exceeds even the impudence of Lord Peter, who &s;wore that the words <HI>gold-lace</HI> meant <HI>a broom-&s;tick.</HI></P>
<P>It would now be nece&s;&s;ary to turn to Mr. Ran|dolph's own explanation of what pa&s;&s;ed between him and Citizen Fauchet, on this occa&s;ion, if his account did not perfectly agree with the one here given, with &s;uch trifling variation of phra&s;eology excepted as was requi&s;ite to encourage the belief, that both were not the work of the &s;ame hand. It does, indeed, appear, that Mr. Randolph imagined in good earne&s;t, that we &s;hould yield an implicit confidence to what Citizen Fauchet has &s;aid in his
<PB N="34" REF="030215_0033_0FE523AD6232A380">
certificate; for, he &s;eems to have been anxious a|bout nothing but con&s;uming it with his own pro|te&s;tations, without attempting to do away the charge contained in the intercepted letter. Our inquiries, however, are not thus to be diverted. We are not thus to be fobbed off with an ex-po&s;t-facto certificate, and the commentaries thereon. How came Mr. Randolph to be of opinion that flour-merchants would, above all others, be the per&s;ons to unravel the intrigues of Mr. Hammond. He is the fir&s;t &s;tate&s;|man, I believe, that ever thought of employing men of this profe&s;&s;ion to dive into the &s;ecrets of foreign mini&s;ters. And why &s;hould he &s;uppo&s;e, that the flour merchants of Citizen Fauchet were in the con|fidence of the Engli&s;h faction, and that the very ones whom he &s;hould choo&s;e from among&s;t them, were debtors, and debtors, too, to Briti&s;h mer|chants? Poor fellows! he would have broken his heart, if they had been "harra&s;&s;ed and arre&s;ted," in con&s;equence of their zeal! It was &s;omething ex|traordinary al&s;o, that he did not know the law of this country better than to fear that they might be kept in pri&s;on for debt. He will make but a poor &s;olicitor in the courts of <HI>Virginia,</HI> if he does not know how to keep a fradulent debtor out of jail; and it is very probable, that this little &s;lip of the pen may hurt him more, in the opinion of his pre&s;ent neigh|bours, than his <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions,</HI> or even than his <HI>overtures for money.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Randolph pretends that, &s;o far from having made overtures for him&s;elf and Co. he rejects with horror the idea of giving a pair of gloves even to the&s;e hone&s;t flour-men. Citizen Fauchet, it is true, did under&s;tand Mr. Randolph as advi&s;ing him to ob|tain intelligence, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting with <HI>loans</HI> tho&s;e who had contracted with him for flour; but now, cal|ling to mind all the circum&s;tances, he has an <HI>inti|mate conviction,</HI> that he was mi&s;taken in the propo&s;i|tions
<PB N="35" REF="030215_0034_0FE52407164D3698">
of Mr. Randolph, who only a&s;ked if the&s;e good people could not be accommodated with the <Q>&s;ums <HI>due them</HI> on their contracts!</Q> Hence, then, they wi&s;h to infer, that all was fair and hone&s;t; that no &s;uch thing as corruption was ever dreamt of. Ad|mit them this, for a moment, and then let them ac|count for the following expre&s;&s;ions, which come im|mediately after the money overtures, mentioned in the di&s;patch, No. 6. <Q>This inquiry <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed me much.</HI> It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to make a <HI>&s;atisfac|tory an&s;wer.</HI> You know my <HI>want of power,</HI> and my <HI>defect of pecuniary means.</HI> I &s;hall <HI>draw my&s;elf off from the affair</HI> by &s;ome common-place remarks, and by throwing my&s;elf on the <HI>pure</HI> and unalte|rable principles of the Republic.</Q> Now, why <HI>pure?</HI> Why throw him&s;elf on the <HI>pure principles</HI> of his Republic? How could the <HI>pure principles</HI> of his Republic forbid him to yield to a propo&s;al that had nothing <HI>impure</HI> in it? And, why does he talk of his want of <HI>power</HI> and of <HI>pecuniary means?</HI> Would it not be the height of &s;tupidity for a man to talk this way, if he was required to do nothing but to pay three or four flour-men the <Q>&s;ums <HI>due them</HI> on their contracts?</Q></P>
<P>Nor was &s;uch a trifling propo&s;al better calculated to awaken in Citizen Fauchet the&s;e reflections: <Q>Thus with &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars, the Repub|lic could have decided on civil war, or on peace! Thus, the <HI>con&s;ciencies</HI> of the <HI>pretended patriots</HI> of America have already <HI>their prices!</HI> It is very true that the certainty of the&s;e conclu&s;ions, <HI>pain|ful to be drawn,</HI> will for ever exi&s;t <HI>in our archives!</HI> What will be the old age <HI>of the government,</HI> if it is thus early <HI>decrepid!</HI></Q>&mdash;Would any man, ex|cept a madman or a fool, have made the&s;e reflec|tions on a propo&s;al to pay certain merchants <Q><HI>&s;ums</HI> due them,</Q> and particularly when tho&s;e &s;ums were
<PB N="36" REF="030215_0035_0FE523AF25752450">
to enable them to <HI>&s;erve their country,</HI> by exploring the &s;ecret machinations of an ho&s;tile power? Mr. Randolph's propo&s;ing to come at the &s;ecrets of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter by prevailing on Citizen Fauchet to pay the &s;ums due to his contractors, would cer|tainly have excited a laugh in Fauchet: and, if he had thought &s;uch a &s;illy propo&s;ition worth a men|tion in his di&s;patches, he would naturally have &s;aid: what a loggerheaded fellow they have cho&s;en for Secretary of State here! Would you imagine that he has propo&s;ed to me, to pay my flour-contractors what I <HI>owe them,</HI> as a mean of inducing them to penetrate into the de&s;igns of the Engli&s;h govern|ment! The man mu&s;t certainly be out of his wits, or he never would be fooli&s;h enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e people, in gratitude for having received <HI>no more than their due</HI> from <HI>me,</HI> would be induced to undertake a dangerous and expen&s;ive &s;ervice <HI>for him.</HI> However, the poor man, though a little crack-brained, is a good patriot, and has no other motive in all this than to &s;erve his country.&mdash; The&s;e would have been the remarks of Citizen Fau|chet, had the overtures been of the nature he now pretends they were. He would have had all the rea&s;on in the world to accu&s;e the Secretary of folly, but none to accu&s;e him of guilt; none to author|ize tho&s;e bitter reflections on the <HI>&s;aleablene&s;s</HI> of the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of the <HI>pretended</HI> patriots of America, or on the <HI>decrepitude</HI> of <HI>the government.</HI></P>
<P>This is not all. If the overtures for money were in behalf of Citizen Fauchet's flour-men, there re|mains a very important pa&s;&s;age of his intercepted letter, which both he and the Vindicator have left unexplained. It is this. <Q><HI>As &s;oon as it was de|cided</HI> that the French Republic <HI>purcha&s;ed no men to do their duty,</HI> there were to be &s;een individuals, about who&s;e conduct the government could at lea&s;t form unea&s;y conjectures, giving them&s;elves
<PB N="37" REF="030215_0036_0FE4FE2FC8CE3A08">
up with a <HI>&s;candalous o&s;tentation</HI> to <HI>its views,</HI> and even <HI>&s;econding its declarations.</HI> The Popular Socie|ties &s;oon emitted re&s;olutions &s;tamped with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and who, although they may have been advi&s;ed by love of order, might neverthele&s;s have omitted, or uttered them with le&s;s &s;olemni|ty. Then were &s;een coming <HI>from the very men whom we had been accu&s;tomed to regard as having little friend&s;hip for the &s;y&s;tem of the Trea&s;urer, har|rangues without end,</HI> in order to give a new di|rection to the public mind. The militia, howe|ver, manife&s;t &s;ome repugnance, particularly in Penn&s;ylvania; at la&s;t by <HI>excur&s;ions or harrangues,</HI> incomplete requi&s;itions are obtained. How much more intere&s;ting than the <HI>changeable men</HI> I have painted above, were tho&s;e plain citizens, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>That Citizen Fauchet under&s;tood the money over|tures to be made on the part of the&s;e <HI>changeable men,</HI> is evident; for the pa&s;&s;age here tran&s;cribed follows immediately after the paragraph in which tho&s;e overtures are mentioned. And, the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf is too unequivocal to be mi&s;under&s;tood. All this &s;candalous o&s;tentation, he &s;ays, the&s;e &s;econd|hand declarations, and harrangues without end, <HI>in favour</HI> of the government, took place, among the&s;e <HI>changeable men,</HI> as &s;oon as it was known (and not before) that the French Republic purcha&s;ed no men to do their duty. Now, then, let Mr. Ran|dolph, or any one of the&s;e <HI>changeable men,</HI> twi&s;t this pa&s;&s;age till it applies to his flour-merchants, if he can. What! did the flour-merchants give them|&s;elves up <HI>to the views of the government</HI> with a <HI>&s;can|dalous o&s;tentation?</HI> What harrangues did the&s;e poor devils ever make, I wonder, to di&s;gui&s;e their pa&s;t views, and give a new direction to the public mind? We all know that the Democratic Societies and the good Governor of Penn&s;ylvania i&s;&s;ued <HI>declarations &s;econding</HI> that of the government; but the flour-merchants
<PB N="38" REF="030215_0037_0FE523B0AAF12A00">
never i&s;&s;ued any, or, at lea&s;t, that I know of.

Ne|verthele&s;s, as we profe&s;s to make ob&s;ervations on the Vindication, all that it contains, however fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, claims &s;ome &s;hare of our attention; and, therefore, we mu&s;t now take a view of what has been &s;aid concerning the application of the mo|ney to be obtained by the overtures of Mr. Ran|dolph, beginning, as before, with the certificate of Citizen Fauchet.</P>
<P>After telling us that he had frequently had con|ver&s;ations with Mr. Randolph about the in&s;urrec|tion, and that he him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected the Engli&s;h of fomenting and &s;upporting it, he &s;ays: <Q>I commu|nicated my &s;u&s;picions to Mr. Randolph.

how came the wi&s;e Mr. Randolph to imagine that the contractors would have made a journey from Virginia, were the greate&s;t part of them were, or e|ven from this city, to New-York, in order to dive into Mrs. Hammond's and her maid's &s;ecrets?

<P>If the overtures had been for money to be em|ployed in the procuring of intelligence of what the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter was about, is it not natural to &s;up|po&s;e, that Citizen Fauchet would have mentioned this circum&s;tance in his very confidential letter?

<P>He could have <HI>decided on civil war or on peace.</HI> If we are to under&s;tand by civil war, <HI>a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition to the Federal government,</HI> the whole of his letter, from one end to the other, proves that no|thing was &s;o near his heart. He every where ex|claims again&s;t the ambitious views of the govern|ment, and defends the cau&s;e of the in&s;urgents. He &s;peaks of them as an oppre&s;&s;ed people, and of the laws which they were armed to oppo&s;e, as har&s;h and unnece&s;&s;ary. The anarchical a&s;&s;embly in the neighbourhood of Pitt&s;burgh, tho&s;e outrageous villains who in&s;ulted the officers of ju&s;tice, plunder|ed the mail, drove peaceable and orderly people from their dwellings, dragged others forth to in|dure every other cruelty &s;hort of death, and who, in a word, were daily committing robbery and murder; this a&s;&s;embly of ruffians he calls, <Q>the <HI>very pacific</HI> union of the counties in Braddock's Field! a union which could not ju&s;tify the rai&s;|ing of &s;o great a force as fifteen thou&s;and men.&mdash; Be&s;ides," adds he, "<HI>the principles</HI> uttered in the declarations of the&s;e people, rather announced <HI>ardent minds to be calmed than anarchi&s;ts to be &s;ub|dued.</HI></Q> When he comes to &s;peak of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to enforce the exci&s;e law, he gives way to the mo&s;t bitter invectives, and almo&s;t cur&s;es the of|ficers of government, who coun&s;elled the marching of the troops. But, at la&s;t, he is compelled to give an account of the triumph of the Federal army; and here we plainly perceive, by the chagrin he ex|pre&s;&s;es at that event, what he would have de&s;ired. He laments that the government will acquire &s;tabi|lity from it, <HI>"for one complete &s;e&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t,"</HI> the

<P>Who, then, can be &s;tupid enough to believe, that if this man had had <Q>&s;ome thou&s;ands of dol|lars</Q> to advance, he would have advanced them to aid the government, either directly or indirectly, <HI>again&s;t the in&s;urgents,</HI> and <HI>to &s;ave</HI> the country from a civil war?

<P>As to the words, in the di&s;patch No. 6. which are allowed to &s;ignify, <HI>&s;ave the country,</HI> they mu&s;t not be thus disjointed from what precedes them.

<P>As a convincing proof that the overtures men|tioned by Citizen Fauchet ought to be under&s;tood, as made to obtain money for &s;upporting, in &s;ome way or other, the in&s;urrection in the We&s;t, and that the whole letter inevitably conveys this meaning, we need no other proof than that furni&s;hed by Mr. Randolph him&s;elf. It will certainly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he, above all others, would read this e&s;&s;ay on bribery and corruption with an anxious and &s;cruti|nizing eye? We may fairly pre&s;ume, that he con|ned it over with more attention than ever &s;chool|boy did his le&s;&s;on, or monk his breviary; and that, from the moment he was in his penitential weeds, he repeated the &s;ome-thou&s;and-dollar &s;en|tence as often as a devotee catholic repeats her <HI>Ave-Maria.</HI> Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this; not|with&s;tanding the intere&s;t he had in finding &s;ome o|ther meaning for it; notwith&s;tanding even his ta|lent at warping and twi&s;ting and turning every thing that falls in his way, we find him, on the 19th of Augu&s;t; writing to the Pre&s;ident thus: <Q>For I here mo&s;t &s;olemnly deny, that any overture e|ver came from me, which was to produce money <HI>to me</HI> [and not to flour-merchants], or any others for me; and that in any manner directly or indi|rectly, was a &s;hilling ever received by me; nor was it ever contemplated by me, that one &s;hilling &s;hould be applied by Mr. Fauchet to any purpo&s;e, <HI>relative to the in&s;urrection.</HI></Q>&mdash;He under&s;tood, then, the letter to mean, that money was to be received by him, and that it was to be applied to &s;ome pur|po&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="030215_0052_0FE5233455F67790">
relative to the in&s;urrection. This was the charge that he at fir&s;t thought the letter contained again&s;t him. And when did he begin to think o|therwi&s;e?&mdash;After he had been to &s;ee Citizen Fau|chet at Rhode I&s;land, and not a moment before. It was after this edifying <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;&mdash;t&ecirc;te</HI> with his old Fa|ther Jo&s;eph, that he began to recollect all about the flour-merchants and Mr. Hammond's Congre&s;s; and &s;o, with his memory thus refre&s;hed, he comes back, and tells us in his Vindication. <Q>Mr. Fau|chet's letter, indeed, made me <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that No. 6. <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> alluded to &s;ome actual or proffered <HI>loan</HI> or expenditure, for the <HI>nouri&s;hment</HI> of the in&s;ur|rection: and, therefore, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to deny, in my letter of the 19th of Augu&s;t, that one &s;hilling was contemplated by me to be appli|ed by Mr. Fauchet relative to the in&s;urrection.</Q></P>
<P>Citizen Fauchet's memory, too, was, it &s;eems, furbi&s;hed up by this <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&egrave;te;</HI> for he tells us, in his certificate, that, <Q><HI>now</HI> calling to mind all the circum&s;tances, to which the <HI>que&s;tions of Mr. Ran|dolph</HI> call my attention, I have an intimate con|viction that I was <HI>mi&s;taken in the propo&s;itions,</HI> which I <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to have been made to me.</Q>&mdash;So, here is a pretty &s;tory for you: Mr. Randolph forget all about the flour merchants, till he talks to Citizen Fauchet, and Citizen Fauchet forgets all about them, till he talks to Mr. Randolph! Their me|mories, like a flint and &s;teel, could bring forth no light but by friction with each other. If this do not prove a clo&s;e connection, I do not know what does. Even "their minds," as the poet &s;ays, <Q>in wed|lock's bands were join'd.</Q></P>
<P>There is another &s;ingularity worth notice here. Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter was written on the 31&s;t of October, 1794; and, at that time (though it was ju&s;t after the overtures were made), he did not recollect a word about the flour-men, nor a+bout
<PB N="54" REF="030215_0053_0FE5233FC32A8048">
the machinations of the Engli&s;h: but, on the 27th of September, 1795, that is to &s;ay, ten months and twenty-&s;even days afterwards, he has an <HI>intimate conviction</HI> of the whole matter; and tells as good a tough &s;tory about it, as one can in con&s;cience ex|pect from a being that kneels down at the &s;hrine of a Jack-A&s;s. Mr. Randolph, al&s;o, recollected nothing about it on the 19th of Augu&s;t, but, in &s;ome thir|ty days after, it all came as pat into his head, as if it had but that moment happened.&mdash;Rhode-I&s;land mu&s;t be like the cave of the Dervi&s;e, where every one that entered &s;aw, written in large characters; all the actions of his pa&s;t life. If &s;o, no wonder our Adventurers made &s;uch ha&s;te to quit it.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, without begging the reader once more to call to mind the &s;arca&s;ms that Citizen Fauchet pours out on the <HI>changeable men,</HI> who &s;econded the views of the government with the mo&s;t &s;candalous o&s;tentation, who uttered re&s;olu|tions and harrangues without end, and who made excur&s;ions to collect troops, <Q>as &s;oon as it was de|cided that the French Republic purcha&s;ed no men to do their <HI>duty.</HI></Q> Mr. Randolph lays hold of this word <HI>duty,</HI> too, as a drowning man would of a &s;traw, and to ju&s;t as much purpo&s;e; for, if, by this word, Citizen Fauchet meant the <HI>real</HI> duty of the&s;e harranguers, they were here in the performance of it. Their duty, their allegiance to the United States, required them to &s;peak forcible to the peo|ple, to &s;econd the declarations of the general go|vernment, and, if ordered, to make excur&s;ions to collect troops; and yet, he tells us, or rather he tells the French government, that they did all this; <Q>as &s;oon as it was decided that the French Repub|lic <HI>purcha&s;ed no men to do their duty.</HI></Q> Hence it is a clear ca&s;e, that what he conceived to be their duty, and what he would have paid them to per|form, if he had had money, was exactly the contrary
<PB N="55" REF="030215_0054_0FE52414435E8C80">
of all this; and exactly the contrary of this would have been, an oppo&s;ition to the general govern|ment, it is probable defeat, and con&s;equent de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>After all, to fix the blacke&s;t guilt on the con&s;pi|rators, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to prove what their pre|ci&s;e intentions were. It is &s;ufficient, that we have the cleare&s;t evidence, that, in con&s;ideration of &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars, they would have enabled a fo|reign nation to decide <HI>on civil war or on peace</HI> for this country. After having, then, &s;atisfied our|&s;elves with re&s;pect to <HI>who they are,</HI> this is the crime we have to lay to their charge. All their a&s;&s;evera|tions, all their windings and &s;ubterfuges are vain: they will never wa&s;h away the &s;tain, as long as words &s;hall retain their meaning, and as long as virtue &s;hall hold her &s;eat in our hearts and rea&s;on in our minds.</P>
<P>I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the reader's patience much longer than I intended, and, I fear, longer than he will excu&s;e; but, as I have promi&s;ed to take &s;ome notice of the Vindicator's attempt at recrimi|nation, I mu&s;t be as good as my word.</P>
<P>He has exerted his labyrinthian faculties to the utmo&s;t, in order to make it believed, that the Pre|&s;ident of the United States ratified the Treaty with Great Britain, under the influence of what he mo|de&s;tly terms, a Briti&s;h faction. With this object in view, he &s;ays, as addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Pre&s;i|dent: <Q>By my advice the United States would have been ma&s;ters of all contingences at the end of the campaign. To my unutterable a&s;toni&s;h|ment, I &s;oon di&s;covered that you were receding from your <HI>determination.</HI> You had been reflect|ing upon your cour&s;e from the 26th of June to the 16th of July; on the latter day you decided on it; a communication was made to the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;ter in conformity with it; letters were addre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="56" REF="030215_0055_0FE523460B98B448">
to our own mini&s;ters a conformity to it; they were in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pected by you, before you re&s;cinded your purpo&s;e; no imperious circum&s;tances had ari&s;en, except the &s;trength of the popular voice, which would, according to ordinary calculation, corro|borate, not rever&s;e, your former re&s;olution; you a&s;&s;igned no new rea&s;ons for the new mea&s;ures; and you di&s;regarded the an&s;wer to Bo&s;ton, al|though it had committed you upon a &s;pecial fact, namely, a determination not to ratify during the exi&s;tence of the provi&s;ion-order. While I was &s;earching for the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular revolution; and could not but remember, that another opi|nion, which was always weighty with you, had advi&s;ed you not to exchange ratifications, until the provi&s;ion-order &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, or the American mini&s;ter &s;hould receive further in|&s;tructions, if it were not aboli&s;hed; after duty had dictated to me an acquie&s;cence in your <HI>va|ried &s;entiments,</HI> and I had prepared a memorial to Mr. Hammond adapted to them; after you had &s;igned the ratification on the 18th of Augu&s;t; Mr. Fauchet's letter brought forth a &s;olution of the whole affair; thence it was that <HI>you were per|&s;uaded</HI> to lay a&s;ide all <HI>fear of a check</HI> from the <HI>friends of France;</HI> thence it was that <HI>my&s;elf and the French</HI> cau&s;e were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly abandoned.</Q></P>
<P>This appears to be the &s;um of Mr. Randolph's &s;tatement, the correctne&s;s of which is, at lea&s;t, ve|ry doubtful; but, not to tire the reader with a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of little importance as to the main point, and in which I might po&s;&s;ibly err, I &s;hall take it for granted, that all that he has &s;aid and in&s;inuated here is &s;trictly true; and then his charge amounts to this: that the Pre&s;ident, even after the deci&s;ion of the Senate with re&s;pect to the Treaty was known, he&s;itated, from the 26th of June to the 13th of July, as to what cour&s;e he &s;hould pur&s;ue in regard
<PB N="57" REF="030215_0056_0FE5234F1B39A290">
to the ratification; that, on the day la&s;t mention|ed, he came to a re&s;olution not to ratify, until the orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f His Britannic Maje&s;ty, for &s;eizing provi|&s;ions de&s;tined from this country to France, &s;hould be withdrawn; and that, notwith&s;tanding this re|&s;olution, he did afterwards ratify, leaving the or|der in force, and that he was induced to this change of conduct from the di&s;covery made by Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter.</P>
<P>Now, admitting all this to be &s;o, it requires&punc; greater degree of penetration than I am ma&s;ter of, to perceive how it proves the Pre&s;ident to have ra|tified the Treaty under the influence of a Briti&s;h faction, or any faction at all.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem, that the Vindicator imagines, that, when a man has once taken a re&s;olution, he can never change it, without incurring the cen&s;ure of acting under &s;ome undue influence. How far &s;uch a maxim is from being founded in truth the expe|rience of every day will prove. A voluntary re&s;o|lution mu&s;t ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to be formed upon ex|i&s;ting circum&s;tances; and, of cour&s;e, if any thing ari&s;es that totally alters tho&s;e circum&s;tances, it would be mere ob&s;tinacy to adhere to the re&s;olution. If, for in&s;tance, a man determines on giving up a part of his income to a friend, and the next day finds that friend plotting again&s;t his life, mu&s;t he, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;covery, put his determination in practice, or be &s;ubjected to the charge of acting under &s;ome undue influence? To maintain &s;uch a po&s;ition appears to have been re&s;erved for Mr. Ran|dolph alone. The true que&s;tion, therefore, is this: Was the di&s;covery, made by Citizen Fauchet's in|tercepted letter, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the Pre&s;ident's altering his re&s;olution, or not?</P>
<P>The only objection that it is pretended the Pre&s;i|dent ever had to ratify the Treaty, as advi&s;ed by the
<PB N="58" REF="030215_0057_0FE4FE34769F0458">
Senate, was, the exi&s;tence of the order of the King of Great Britain for &s;eizing provi&s;ions de&s;tined from this country to France; becau&s;e, he was given to under&s;tand that ratifying while this order re|mained in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, might look like acknowledging the legality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;eizure, and might embroil the United States with the French Republic. That this was the &s;ugge&s;tion of Mr. Randolph he now avows; and he even owns; nay, boa&s;ts, that he never would have given his advice in favour of the ratification at all, if he had not remembered, <Q>that if the <HI>people</HI> were adver&s;e to the Treaty, it was the con&s;titutional right of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives to <HI>refu&s;e,</HI> upon original grounds, <HI>unfettered by the Senate and Pre&s;ident,</HI> to pa&s;s the laws <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its execution.</HI></Q> He has been tempted to make this avowal in order to ingratiate him&s;elf with the Oppo&s;ition; and the need they have of a man, able and willing to expo&s;e every &s;ecret of the Exe|cutive, may, perhaps, in&s;ure him a momentary &s;ucce&s;s; but the avowal furni&s;hes, at the &s;ame time, an irre&s;i&s;tible proof of his double dealing. We plainly perceive from this, as well as from all the documents he has brought forward, on the &s;ubject, that he was the great, if not the only cau&s;e, of the delaying of the ratification. Fir&s;t he &s;tarts objec|tions; then propo&s;es conferences between him&s;elf and the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter; then he drafts memori|als; in &s;hort, he was taking his mea&s;ures for un|doing all that had been done, or, as Mr. Pickering well termed it, for <Q>throwing the whole up in the wind.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Pre&s;ident was, at this time, truely critical. On the one hand, he &s;aw an in&s;tru|ment ready for his &s;ignature, which completed the long-de&s;ired object, an amicable termination of all differences with Great Britain; an object that twen|ty long years of war and di&s;putation had not been
<PB N="59" REF="030215_0058_0FE523116FE0CA48">
able to accompli&s;h: on the other hand, he was haunted with the feigned, but terrific forebodings of an artful Secretary of State, who lo&s;t no oppor|tunity of repre&s;enting the con&s;ummation of the act as a ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to France, the <HI>faithful</HI> ally of the United States and the favourite of the people. At this embarra&s;&s;ing moment arrives the intercepted letter of Citizen Fauchet. The charm, that held him in &s;u&s;pence, is at once di&s;&s;olved. Here he &s;ees that the hypocrite in whom he had confided, who fir&s;t awakened doubts in his mind, who had been the cau&s;e of all the procra&s;tination, and who had hitherto withheld his hand; here he &s;ees him at the head of a faction oppo&s;ed to his government, unveiling all its mo&s;t &s;ecret views to a foreign mi|ni&s;ter, and even making overtures for money, which, if acceded to, would have enabled that mini&s;ter to decide on civil war or on peace for this country. Was it not natural to imagine, that he &s;hould now &s;ee the advice of this "pretended patriot" as a lure to lead him into a &s;nare, to render the Treaty abor|tive, and eventually plunge the United States into a war with Great Britain? And was it not, then, I a&s;k, as natural, that he &s;hould turn from it with indignation and horror? "Hence it was," &s;ays the Vindicator, <Q>that <HI>my&s;elf</HI> and the <HI>French cau&s;e</HI> were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly abandoned.</Q> And, upon my &s;oul, I think it was high time.</P>
<P>In this letter the Pre&s;ident &s;aw al&s;o, what it was he had to expect from the <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> of the regenera|ted French.

its want of &s;ucce&s;s, and that he had not the means of nouri&s;hing it. And all this he &s;ees ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the rulers of a nation profe&s;&s;ing the &s;in|cere&s;t friend&s;hip for him&s;elf and the people of Ame|rica. Was it po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;ee any thing here to induce him to delay the ratification of an in&s;trument, calculated to in&s;ure peace and uninter|rupted pro&s;perity to his country, merely for the take of obtaining an advantage for that nation? "Hence," &s;ays the Ex-Secretary, in his plaintive &s;tyle, <Q>Hence it was that he was per&s;uaded to lay a&s;ide all <HI>fear of a check</HI> from the <HI>friends of France.</HI></Q> And well he might; for, what more had he to fear from them? Open war with &s;uch people is as much preferable to their intrigues, as a drawn &s;word is preferable to a poi&s;oned repa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Vindicator, pur&s;uing his plan for opening to him&s;elf a welcome from the adverie (and might &s;ay perver&s;e) party, in&s;iduou&s;ly brings forward the re|mon&s;trances again&s;t the Treaty as a rea&s;on that ought to have prevented its ratification. Few peo|ple, who con&s;ider how the&s;e remon&s;trances were obtained, ever looked upon them as a rea&s;on of any weight: but, whatever attention they might merit before the di&s;covery made by the intercepted letter, they merited none at all afterwards; for, there was, and there is, all the rea&s;on in the world to believe, that they <HI>originated</HI> from the &s;ame all-powerful cau&s;e as did the &s;ugge&s;tions, difficulties and delays of the Vindicator. He would fain per&s;uade us, indeed, that no money overtures ever pa&s;&s;ed between him and Citizen Fauchet, after the little affair of the flour-merchants; but the method he takes of doing this is rather calculated to produce admiration at his effrontery than conviction of his repentance. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Pre&s;ident he &s;ays: <Q>Do you believe, Sir, that if money was pur&s;ued by the Secretary of State, he would have been rebuffed

by an an&s;wer, which <HI>implied no refu&s;al;</HI> and would not have renewed the propo&s;ition; which, how|ever, Mr. Fauchet confe&s;&s;es, <HI>he never heard of again?</HI></Q>&mdash;I do not know what the Pre&s;ident might believe of the Secretary of State; but one would imagine that even &s;uch a rebuff as the Vindicator met with would have prevented any man from re|turning to the charge; however, I &s;hall not contra|dict him here, as he mu&s;t under&s;tand the&s;e things better than I, or, perhaps, any other man living. I ha&s;te to the declaration he quotes from Citizen Fauchet's di&s;patch, No. 6. Yes, it is very true that the Citizen &s;ays in that di&s;patch: <Q>I have ne|ver &s;ince heard of propo&s;itions of this nature.</Q> But when was this di&s;patch written?&mdash;Before the 31&s;t of October, 1794, and, con&s;equently, before the intercepted letter; and Mr. Randolph has the con&s;cience to make this declaration apply to the month of November, 1795. This is another of tho&s;e little twi&s;ts for which our Vindicator is &s;o renowned.</P>
<P>There was great plenty of time for the Citizen to receive a reinforcement from France, before the Treaty made its appearance on this &s;ide of the Ocean; and the regret he expre&s;&s;es at his <Q><HI>want of pecuni|ary means,</HI></Q> when the fir&s;t overtures were made to him, &s;eems to be a tolerable good rea&s;on for pre|&s;uming that he would &s;train every nerve to be able to give a more <HI>"&s;atisfactory an&s;wer"</HI> another time, than that concerning <HI>"the pure principles of his Re|public."</HI> I leave any one to gue&s;s at the low ebb to which he mu&s;t be reduced, when he was obliged to throw him&s;elf on the purity of the French nation, for want of a little of the ready to purcha&s;e the "<HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of the <HI>pretended</HI> patriots of America," which were ju&s;t going off as cheap as neck-beef, or damaged goods at vendue! What mu&s;t be the mor|tification of this &s;peculator in con&s;ciences, when he

He made his court like Jupiter of old, in a golden &s;hower, and, like Jupiter, he &s;ucceeded. Then was the time for trade: then a patriot's con|&s;cience was as good to him as a little e&s;tate: he was not then obliged to hawk it about from door to door, like &s;tinking fi&s;h or rotten peaches.</P>
<P>That Citizen Fauchet would pre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply there can be no rea&s;on to doubt, at lea&s;t from any thing that he has &s;aid to the contrary; for, it was the <Q>want of <HI>power</HI> and defect of <HI>pecu|niary means,</HI></Q> that prevented him from yielding to the overtures that were made him; and not his want of inclination to nouri&s;h the in&s;urrection in the We&s;t. <Q>I &s;hall <HI>draw my&s;elf off,</HI> &s;ays he, by &s;ome common place remarks, and by throwing my&s;elf on the <HI>pure principles of the Republic.</HI></Q> He &s;ays this with a laugh, that very well indicates what he thought of that purity.

that he &s;ays on this &s;ubject. We know what the pure principles of his Republic are. We have &s;een from a report, made in the Convention, that, at Genoa, the&s;e pure principles had made &s;ure of a party, who engaged to open the gates of the City to the French army, and that this plan, after having co&s;t &s;ome millions, failed of &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>When Citizen Fauchet informed the Convention of the great bargains that were offered him here, when they found at what a low rate <Q>the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of the <HI>pretended</HI> patriots of America</Q> were &s;ell|ing off, it would be to contradict every maxim of trade, to &s;uppo&s;e that the purity of their principles and the morals of their nation would prevent them from enabling him to make a purcha&s;e; and par|ticularly at the important moment, when the Trea|ty with Great Britain was to be ratified or rejected. There was, indeed, one difficulty; and that was, the Trea&s;ury of the Convention was nearly as emp|ty as Father Jo&s;eph's pur&s;e or the pouch of his men|dicant pilgrim. And, as to a&s;&s;ignats, be&s;ides their being a tell-tale currency, they never would, as we have no guillotine in the country, have been con|vertible into food and raiment; &s;o that, of cour&s;e, they would have been as de&s;picable and de&s;pi&s;ed wa&s;te-paper, as the <HI>Aurora</HI> of Philadelphia, the <HI>Argus</HI> of New-York, or <HI>Chronicle</HI> of Bo&s;ton.

<P>Will any one believe, then, that the Pre&s;ident, with this conviction on his mind, &s;tood in need of Briti&s;h influence to determine on a ratification? What other determination could he po&s;&s;ibly take? Was he, though he &s;aw the pit open before his eyes, to plunge headlong into it? Was he, after having di&s;covered the con&s;piracy, tamely to yield to its ma|chinations, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ruin of his country? There was but one cour&s;e for him to pur&s;ue to make the government re&s;pected, and bla&s;t all the hopes of the con&s;pirators, and that was to ratify the Trea|ty. By this act he pre&s;erved to us the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ings of peace, gave &s;tability to the Con&s;titution, not only for <HI>one,</HI> but for many <HI>&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> by a legal and manly exerci&s;e of the pow|ers it has ve&s;ted in him, convinced the French that the intere&s;ts of the Union are not to be &s;a|crificed to her vengeance or caprice, and &s;howed to the whole world, that we wi&s;h to live in friend|&s;hip with all nations, but that we are determined to be the &s;laves of none.

<P>I will not, like him, conclude by calling on the people to judge between him and the Pre&s;ident of the United States. Their re&s;pect for the latter would not, I tru&s;t, for a moment endure the com|petition; for, in &s;pite of all the de&s;perate efforts of a di&s;appointed faction, their confidence in Ge|neral WASHINGTON is, and will remain, un&s;haken. His name will be handed down to their children's children, and ever accompanied with gratitude, love, and admiration. It will be the ornament of the hi&s;torian's page, while that of Randolph, &s;hould it be &s;o unfortunate as not to &s;ink into oblivion, will be thrown into &s;ome dark corner, among the "changeable men" and "pretended patriots of America."</P>
