<HEAD>PREFACE to the la&s;t Edition.</HEAD>
<P>THE Public is here pre&s;ented with a New Tran&s;lation of the MORAL MAXIMS of Francis the Sixth, Duke de la Rochefoucault: a performance of &s;uch e&s;timation, that its noble Author lived to &s;ee five or &s;ix Editions of it; and &s;ince his death it has run through as many more; not to mention Tran&s;lations. As far as the two languages permit, the Tran&s;lator has followed in the di&s;po&s;ition of the Maxims the alphabetical order of Mr. Amelot de la Hou&s;&s;aye: to whom he is al&s;o beholden for many well-col|lected authorities from the judicious Ta|citus, and &s;ome other ancient writers. In his own notes he has chiefly aimed at the explanation, or illu&s;tration, of his Author's &s;y&s;tem. He has rejected &s;uch maxims as were manife&s;t repetitions, or apparently &s;purious; and retained only &s;uch as, after compari&s;on of the be&s;t Edi|tions, he concluded to be genuine. He has al&s;o taken great care to <HI>expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of the Original</HI> (in which the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="015864_0004_0F9A315E1F991C80">Tran&s;lations have been hitherto de|fective); and at the &s;ame time (what none of them have attempted) to do the Duke de la Rochefoucault the ju&s;tice to make him <HI>&s;peak Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement to the Lon|don Edition of 1775.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Edition of the Duke de la Roche|foucault's Maxims is not merely a republication of the la&s;t. The Tran&s;la|tion has been revi&s;ed, and treated with that &s;ort of freedom, which the former Editor &s;eems to have taken with the edi|tion that preceded. From this attention, and various additional Notes, the Edition now &s;ubmitted to the Public may have obtained, it is hoped, &s;ome degree of ad|vantage. But, after all, to transfu&s;e into our language the force and &s;pirit of the original with conci&s;ene&s;s and per&s;picuity is rather to be attempted than executed.</P>
<P>High in e&s;teem as the&s;e Maxims are held, it mu&s;t be allowed that the ingeni|ous Writer &s;tands critici&s;ed by many as too &s;evere a Cen&s;or, giving ill con&s;tructi|ons to indifferent actions, and a&s;cribing e|ven to good ones unworthy motives.</P>
<P>In favour of our Author's &s;y&s;tem it is alledged, that perfect virtue is not to be found in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; that
<PB N="8" REF="015864_0006_0F9A31620B5611B0">a mixture of error and truth con&s;titutes too many of our actions; that He has con&s;i|dered the heart of man as corrupted by pride, &s;educed by &s;elf-love, encompa&s;&s;ed by bad example; that certain human ac|tions, which the world mi&s;take for vir|tues, are really no more than their re&s;em|blances; that, in &s;pite of the efforts of Rea&s;on, Pride and Self-love never fail to lurk in the rece&s;&s;es of the heart, and dif|fu&s;e their venom, for the mo&s;t part, through its motions and inclinations.</P>
<P>But to enter into a regular defence of this noble Author is not the pre&s;ent de&s;ign. M. De Voltaire indeed has not &s;crupled to a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e Maxims contributed more than any other work to form the ta&s;te of the French nation, and give it a true reli&s;h for propriety and correctne&s;s. "Though," &s;ays he, <Q>there is but one truth running through the whole piece, namely, that &s;elf-love is the &s;pring of all our actions and determinations; yet this thought pre&s;ents it&s;elf under &s;uch a variety of forms, as never fail to &s;trike with new &s;urprize. This little collec|tion
<PB N="9" REF="015864_0007_0F9A316379C70FB8">was much read and admired; it accu&s;tomed our authors to think, and to comprize their thoughts in a lively, correct, and delicate turn of phra&s;e; which was a merit utterly unknown to any European writer before him, &s;ince the revival of letters. His Memoirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem d'Anne d'Autriche.</NOTE> are &s;till read, and his Maxims <HI>are known by heart.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Slecle de Louis XIV.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>In the Earl of Che&s;terfield's Letters, lately publi&s;hed, we frequently view his Lord&s;hip both as an admirer and defender of our Author. <Q>La Rochefoucault is, I know, blamed,</Q> &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, <Q>but, I think, without rea&s;on, for deriv|ing all our actions from the &s;ource of &s;elf-love. For my own part, I &s;ee a great deal of truth, and no harm at all, in that opinion. It is &s;ufficient that we &s;eek our own happine&s;s in every thing we do; and it is as certain that we can only find it in doing well, and in con|forming all our actions to the rule of right rea&s;on, which is the great law of
<PB N="10" REF="015864_0008_0F9A31648291B318">Nature. It is only a mi&s;taken &s;elf-love that is a blameable motive, when we take the immediate and indi&s;criminate gratification of a pa&s;&s;ion, or appetite, for real happine&s;s. But am I blameable, if I do a good action upon account of the happine&s;s which that hone&s;t con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s will give me? Surely not. On the contrary, that plea&s;ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is a proof of my virtue, &amp;c. &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> 129.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;Again, <Q>Read in the morning &s;ome of La Roch|efoucault's Maxims; con&s;ider them, examine them well, and compare them with the real characters you meet in the evening.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> 225.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;<Q>Till you come to know mankind by your own experience, I know no thing, nor no man, that can, in the mean time, bring you &s;o well ac|quainted with them as Le Duc de la Rochefoucault.

Hence the unde&s;erved reputation of &s;ome of the author, of that period.

<PB N="19" REF="015864_0016_0F9A316D4B7CEB00">of weeping for the lo&s;s of one who was dear to us, we weep for our&s;elves: we weep over the diminution of our fortune, of our plea&s;ure, of our importance. Thus have the dead the honour of tears which &s;tream only for the living. I call this a &s;ort of hypocri&s;y, becau&s;e we impo&s;e on our&s;elves. There is another hypocri&s;y, which is le&s;s innocent, becau&s;e it impo&s;es on the world. This is the affliction of &s;uch as a&s;pire to the glory of a great and immortal &s;orrow: when time, which con|&s;umes all things, has worn out the grief which they really had, they &s;till per&s;i&s;t in their tears, lamentations, and &s;ighs. They a&s;&s;ume a mournful behaviour; and labour, by all their actions, to demon&s;trate that their affliction will not in the lea&s;t abate till death. This di&s;agreeable, this trouble&s;ome vanity is common among am|bitious women. As the &s;ex bars all the paths to glory, they endeavour to render them&s;elves celebrated by the o&s;tentation of an incon&s;olable affliction. There is yet another &s;pecies of tears, who&s;e &s;hallow &s;prings ea&s;ily overflow, and as ea&s;ily day
<PB N="20" REF="015864_0017_0F9A316DDD4FFB88">away: we weep, to acquire the reputation of being tender; we weep, in order to be pitied; we weep, that we may be wept over; we even weep, to avoid the &s;candal of not weeping.</P>

<HEAD>DEATH.</HEAD>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. Few people are well ac|quainted with Death. It is generally &s;ubmitted to through &s;tupidity and cu&s;|tom, not re&s;olution: mo&s;t mer die mere|ly becau&s;e they cannot help it.</P>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. Death and the &s;un are not to be looked at &s;teadily.</P>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. After having &s;poken of the fal&s;ity of &s;eeming virtues, it is proper to &s;ay &s;omething about the fal&s;ity of the contempt of death: I mean that contempt
<PB N="36" REF="015864_0033_0F9A318261612A80">of death which the heathens boa&s;ted to derive from their natural &s;trength, un&s;up|ported by the hopes of a better life. There is a wide difference between &s;uffer|ing death courageou&s;ly, and contemning it: the one is common enough; but the other, I believe, never &s;incere. Every thing has been written that can per&s;uade us that death is no evil; and &s;ome of the weake&s;t as well as the greate&s;t of men have given celebrated examples in con|firmation of this tenet. Yet I doubt whether any per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e ever be|lieved it; and the pains we take to per|&s;uade our&s;elves and others of it plainly e|vince that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k. A man may, for many rea&s;ons, be di&s;gu&s;ted with life; but he can have no rea&s;on for contemning death. Even &s;uicides e&s;teem it no &s;light matter, and are as much &s;tartled at it, and decline it as much as other people, when it comes in any other &s;hape except that which they have cho&s;en. The remarka|ble inequality in the courage of many va|liant men proceeds from death's appearing differently to their imaginations, and
<PB N="37" REF="015864_0034_0F9A3182E4E1C9A8">&s;eeming more in&s;tant at one time than a|nother. By this means it happens, that, after having contemned what they did not know, they are at la&s;t afraid of what they do know. We mu&s;t avoid con&s;idering death in all its circum&s;tances, if we would not think it the greate&s;t of all ills. The wi&s;e&s;t and brave&s;t are tho&s;e who make the be&s;t pretences for not con&s;idering it at all: for every one that views it in its proper light will find it &s;ufficiently terrible. The nece&s;&s;ity of dying made the whole of phi|lo&s;ophic fortitude. The philo&s;ophers thought it be&s;t to do that with a good grace which was not to be avoided; and, being unable to make them&s;elves immor|tal, they did all they could to immortalize their reputations, and &s;ave what they might out of the general wreck. To be able to put a good face on the matter, let us by no means di&s;cover even to our&s;elves all we think about it; let us tru&s;t rather to con&s;titution, than to tho&s;e vain rea&s;on|ings which make us believe we can ap|proach death with indifference. The glory of dying re&s;olutely, the hopes of be|ing
<PB N="38" REF="015864_0035_0F9A31839E61AA08">regretted, the de&s;ire of leaving a fair reputation, the a&s;&s;urance of being deliver|ed from the mi&s;eries of life, and freed from the caprice of fortune, are alleviat|ing reflections, not to be rejected: but we mu&s;t by no means imagine them infalli|ble. The&s;e &s;erve indeed to embolden us, ju&s;t as in war a poor hedge emboldens the &s;oldiers to approach an ince&s;&s;ant fir|ing. At a di&s;tance, they view it as a &s;helter; when they come up, they find it but a &s;orry defence. We flatter our&s;elves too much, in fancying that death, when near, will appear what we judged it to be when di&s;tant; and that our opinions, which are weakne&s;s it&s;elf, will be firm e|nough not to give way on this &s;evere&s;t of trials. We mu&s;t be al&s;o but ill-acquain|ted with the effects of &s;elf-love, to ima|gine that <HI>that</HI> will permit us to think lightly of an action which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be its de&s;truction. Rea&s;on, from whom we expect mighty a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is too feeble, on this occa&s;ion, to make us believe what we wi&s;h to find true. It is &s;he, on the contrary, who betrays us; and, in&s;tead of
<PB N="39" REF="015864_0036_0F9A3185624BD0D0">in&s;piring a contempt of death, helps only to di&s;cover its horrors. Indeed all &s;he can do for us is, to advi&s;e us to avert our eyes, and &s;ix them on &s;ome other object. Cato and Brutus cho&s;e noble ones. A footman, &s;ome time &s;ince, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with dancing upon the &s;caffold he was going to be broken on. Thus different motives &s;ometimes produce the &s;ame ef|fect. And &s;o true it is, that whatever di&s;|proportion there may be between the great and the vulgar, we often &s;ee them meet death with the &s;ame countenance: but there is always this difference, that the contempt of death &s;hewn by heroes is owing to their love of glory, which hides it from their &s;ight; and in common peo|ple it proceeds merely from their want of &s;en&s;ibility, which prevents their being a|ware of the greatne&s;s of the evil, and leaves them at liberty to think of &s;ome|thing el&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The contempt of death has been always very ju&s;tly ac|counted a virtue of the fir&s;t cla&s;s.

<P N="401">CCCCI. Self-love is the love of &s;elf, and of every thing for the &s;ake of &s;elf. Self-love makes men idolize them&s;elves, and tyrannize over others, when Fortune gives the means.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Self-love.] Self-love is the &s;pring of all animal action. It is implanted by Nature in animals with a twofold view; the good of the individual, and that of the &s;pecies: and ope|rates on them by a twofold impul&s;e; an in&s;upportable unea|&s;ine&s;s attendant on its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, and a plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation annexed to its gratification. In brutes, this motive to action, being under the &s;ole direction of in&s;tinct, is in general uniform and evident, In man, in&s;tinct has been &s;uperadded to rea&s;on, and &s;elf-love becomes complex and my&s;ierious. It is plain, from fact, that all animals are in &s;ome degree &s;ocial; &s;ome of them (if we may &s;o &s;peak) living under monarchal, &s;ome oligarchal, others democratical, and the re&s;t patriarchal go|vernment. The &s;tifling, or exerting, the principle that thus unites them, has always its concomitant pain or plea&s;ure. And in&s;tinct, where &s;he is &s;ole governe&s;s, impells them un|variably and unerringly to Nature's end and their own good; which are always united, though not always ab&s;olutely the &s;ame. For example, animals eat to appea&s;e their bunger, or plea&s;e their palate; they have no more view to &s;u&s;tenance than the &s;exes, in their intercour&s;e, have to propagation. Men, too, &s;o far as they act under in&s;tinct, act unerringly; when that leaves them, they have recour&s;e to rea&s;on; which not being at all times, nor in all per&s;ons, equally right and &s;trong, does not always prompt to what is equally true and ju&s;t. Society is undoubtedly the intere&s;t of all mankind; and though an univer&s;al government has never yet been, nor mo&s;t probably ever will be formed, yet the wants of every man make him confederate with, and join him&s;elf to, &s;ome particular public. Now, as in order to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;tate it is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uper&s;ede &s;ome private rights, which are indeed compen&s;ated reflectively, though in a le&s;s obvious manner, this &s;eems to produce ca&s;es wherein the good of the government and that of the &s;ubject cla&s;h. And certainly there are occa&s;ionally in&s;tances where the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the commonwealth bear &s;o bard on particular members as would give them a di&s;ta&s;te to &s;ociety, did not the uniting principle, the love of the &s;pecies, the affection for the community of which they are part, lighten the oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;till the grievance, and, by benevolent reflection, even ren|der it plea&s;ureable. To actions deduced from this &s;ource, the &s;elf-love of the re&s;t of the Community (which reaps the benefit of the&s;e &s;eeming &s;elf-&s;acrifices) a&s;cribes extraordinary merit, annexes attendant glory, and calls them virtuous: which virtue, though, relatively to the kind, it be highly meritorious, is yet not di&s;intere&s;ted, becau&s;e repaid by the reflex plea&s;ure of the actor: and may al&s;o be carried &s;o far as to become irrational and vicious; for 'to be vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous," &s;ays Lord Shafte&s;bury, vol. <HI>II.</HI> p 77, <Q>is to have one's affections right in re&s;pect to one's &s;elf as well as of &s;ociety.</Q> So that virtue will be found to be, not a ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;ted bene|volence toward the &s;pecies, but a love of that kind which is its own reward; not a boundle&s;s enthu&s;ia&s;m for the public, but the &s;ocial affection conducted by rea&s;on.

We cannot fathom the depth, nor pene|trate the ob&s;curity of his aby&s;s. There concealed from the mo&s;t piercing eye, he makes numberle&s;s turnings and windings:
<PB N="107" REF="015864_0104_0F9A30658ED09658">there is he often invi&s;ible even to him&s;elf: there he conceives, breeds, and brings up, without being &s;en&s;ible of it, an infinity of likes and di&s;likes; &s;ome of which are &s;o mon&s;trous, that he knows them not when brought in to light, or at lea&s;t cannot pre|vail on him&s;elf to own them. From the night that envelopes him &s;prings the ridi|culous notions he entertains of him&s;elf: thence his errors, his ignorance, his gro&s;s and filly mi&s;takes with re&s;pect to him&s;elf. Thence is it that he imagines his &s;en&s;ati|ons dead, when they are only a&s;leep, that he &s;hall never de&s;ire to run again when once tired; and that he has lo&s;t all the appetites he has &s;ated. But this thick darkne&s;s, which hides him from him&s;elf, hinders him not from &s;eeing perfectly well whatever is without him; in which he re&s;embles the eye, that &s;ees all things except it&s;elf.

No|thing is &s;o clo&s;e and &s;trong as his attach|ments; which he in vain attempts to break through on di&s;covery of the greate&s;t impending mi&s;ery. Yet &s;ometimes, in a &s;hort time, he effects, and without trou|ble, what he had not been able to com|pa&s;s with the greate&s;t efforts, for years. Whence may well be concluded, that it is by him&s;elf that his de&s;ires are inflamed, more than by the beauty and merit of their objects; that it is his ta&s;te that heightens and embelli&s;hes them; that it is him&s;elf that he pur&s;ues; and that he fol|lows his inclination, when he follows things that are agreeable to his inclination. He is compo&s;ed of contrarieties; imperious and obedient, &s;incere and hypocritical, merciful and cruel, timid and bold. He has different inclinations, according to the different tempers that po&s;&s;e&s;s and devote him &s;ometimes to glory, &s;ometimes to wealth, &s;ometimes to plea&s;ure. The&s;e he changes, as age and experience alter: and it is indifferent to him whether he has many inclinations, or only one; becau&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="015864_0106_0F9A3067104924C8">he can &s;plit him&s;elf into many, or collect him&s;elf into one, as it is convenient or a|greeable to him. He is incon&s;tant; and the changes, be&s;ides tho&s;e that happen from external cau&s;es, are numberle&s;s which proceed from him&s;elf. He is in|con&s;tant through levity, through love, through novelty, through &s;atiety, through di&s;gu&s;t, through incon&s;tancy it&s;elf. He is capricious; and &s;ometimes labours with eagerne&s;s and incredible pains to obtain things that are no ways advantageous, nay even hurtful; but which he pur&s;ues mere|ly becau&s;e it is his will. He is whim&s;ical, and often exerts his whole application in employments the mo&s;t trifling; takes the utmo&s;t delight in the mo&s;t in&s;ipid, and pre&s;erves all his haughtine&s;s in the mo&s;t contemptible. He is attendant on all ages and conditions; he lives every where; he lives on every thing; he lives on nothing. He makes him&s;elf ea&s;y either in the enjoy|ment, or privation, of things; he even goes over to tho&s;e who are at variance with him; he enters into their &s;chemes, and, which is wonderful! along with
<PB N="110" REF="015864_0107_0F9A3067CFEE7208">them hates him&s;elf; he con&s;pires his own de&s;truction; he labours to undo him&s;elf; he only de&s;ires to BE; and, that granted, he con&s;ents to be his own enemy.

When we think he relinqui&s;hes his plea&s;ures, he but &s;u&s;pends, or changes them; and even when he is di&s;comfited, and we think we are rid of him, we find him triumphant in his own defeat. Such is &s;elf-love! of which man's life is only a long and great agitation. The &s;ea is its repre&s;entative; in the flux and reflux of who&s;e waves, &s;elf-love may find a lively expre&s;&s;ion of the turbulent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of its thoughts, and of its eternal motion.</P>

<P>PHILOSOPHICAL, and POLITICAL STRICTURES, on the good and bad EFFECTS of NATIONAL PRIDE: Tran&s;lated from the German of Mr. ZIMMERMAN, Phy&s;ician in ordinary to his Britannic Maje&s;ty at Hanover.</P>
<P>EXTRACT from the PREFACE by the Engli&s;h TRANSLATOR.</P>
<Q><P>THIS <HI>production bears &s;o much the &s;tamp of truth, freedom and virtue, that it is &s;ur|pri&s;ing a work of &s;uch character has not yet been tran&s;lated into Eng|li&s;h, and laid before a nation ne|ver wanting to countenance merit, wherever met with. The author is a</HI> SWISS, <HI>and writes with the freedom becoming a virtuous man, born in a country from whence li|berty, virtue, truth and &s;implicity, have not yet been expelled by op|pre&s;&s;ion, vice, flattery and luxury. The applau&s;e of his own country and of Germany has rendered four large impre&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary; to the la&s;t of which the author made im|portant additions. The French, a people not ea&s;ily plea&s;ea in works of this nature, have read this per|formance, tran&s;lated into their lan|guage, with di&s;tingui&s;hed appro|bation; and &s;ome of their capital writers have be&s;towed large enco|miums upon it</HI></P>
<P><HI>Impartial judges will, on peru|&s;al of this work, find it to abound with &s;terling &s;en&s;e and judicious &s;entiments; and although it may po&s;&s;ibly appear to di&s;advantage in the tran&s;lation, there will however &s;till remain &s;ome of the ma&s;terly &s;trokes of our author, however weakened through the transfu&s;ion of his original ideas into Engli&s;h expre&s;&s;ions</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what gives us the be&s;t grounded hopes of the &s;ucce&s;s of this publication is derived from our au|ther's aim to combat prejudice, and to promote the cau&s;e of liberty and virtue, which have always found the mo&s;t numerous and mo&s;t zealous friends in the thinking part of this great and wealthy nation.</HI></P></Q>

<P>An ESSAY ON CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS: Written by the MARQUIS BECCARIA, of MILAN.</P>
<P>With a COMMENTARY, Attributed to Mon&s;ieur De VOLTAIRE.</P>
<P>EXTRACT from the PREFACE of the TRANSLATOR.</P>
<Q><HI>PENAL</HI> laws, &s;o con&s;iderable a part of every &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;la|tion, and of &s;o great importance to the happine&s;s, peace and &s;ecurity of every member of &s;ociety, are &s;till &s;o imperfect, and are attended with &s;o many unnece&s;&s;ary circum|&s;tances of cruelty in all nations, that an attempt to reduce them to the &s;tandard of rea&s;on mu&s;t be in|tere&s;ting to all mankind. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, then, that this little book hath engaged the attention of all ranks of people in every part of Europe. It is now about eighteen months &s;ince the fir&s;t publication; in which time it hath pa&s;&s;ed no le&s;s than &s;ix editions in the origi|nal language; the third of which was printed within &s;ix months af|ter its fir&s;t appearance. It hath been tran&s;lated into French; that tran&s;lation hath al&s;o been &s;everal times reprinted, and perhaps no book on any &s;ubject was ever recei|ved with more avidity, more ge|nerally read, or more univer&s;ally applauded.</Q>
<P>N. B. At Bell's Book-Store may al&s;o be had, great variety of Books in all arts, &s;ciences, and lan|guages; e&s;pecially Greek, Latin, French, and Eng|li&s;h cla&s;&s;ics, Bibles of various kinds, likewi&s;e the very be&s;t French and Engli&s;h Dictionaries.</P>
