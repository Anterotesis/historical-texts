<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I REQUEST your attention to what I am now going to &s;ay to you. It re&s;pects your welfare in this life, and your happine&s;s in that which is to come. It mu&s;t, therefore, be worth your attention.</P>
<P>I once was young, like you, but I am now advanced in years, and op|pre&s;&s;ed with variety of affliction. I feel that I am ha&s;tening fa&s;t to that end, which will be your's, and all the world's, as well as mine.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t it &s;hall plea&s;e our Great Creator to lend me life and &s;trength, I wi&s;h to be employed in doing good: and a better office I cannot be engaged in than that of a&s;&s;i&s;ting your minds, as they open, to di&s;cern and know tho&s;e great truths, on which all your hopes of happine&s;s depend.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things to you, that you may be per&s;uaded, the ob&s;erva|tions I &s;hall make, are meant for your benefit, and that there is a real plea|&s;ure in doing good.</P>
<P>That what we are now about may be for good to our &s;ouls, let us im|plore the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty in a humble, but &s;ervent prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="025223_0004_0FCCA74439771AF8"><HI>O LORD Merciful Father, Creator and Pre&s;erver of all things; Author of life and health, and Giver of every gift which we en|joy; look down from Heaven Thy dwelling place, and in mercy behold us now a&s;&s;embled together before Thee. Grant us the aid of Thy Holy Spirit, &s;o that what we do at this time, may be for Thy glory, and the benefit of our &s;ouls. Make us &s;en&s;ible of Thy great goodne&s;s, and truly thankful for all Thy mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Give us hearts to love Thee above all things; and prepare our minds for a knowledge of tho&s;e truths, which concern the hap|pine&s;s of our &s;ouls forever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As we grow in years, grant that we grow in grace, in know|ledge and in wi&s;dom, that we may diligently &s;trive to do&punc; Thy will, and obey Thy Holy Commandments.

<P><HI>Hear us; O Lord our God, we be&s;eech Thee to hear us; and for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Saviour and Redeemer, we humbly implore &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings and gifts as may be nece&s;&s;ary for making us the happy children of the</HI> MOST HIGH GOD, <HI>our Heavenly Father.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ECCLESIASTIS XII. I.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;REMEMBER NOW THY CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF THY YOUTH.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS ye have been born in a part of the world that profe&s;&s;eth Chri&s;tianity, ye have no doubt been of|ten told that there is one <HI>Supreme</HI> Being, God over all: that He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and of every thing that is in them contained: that, as He created all things, &s;o He pre&s;erveth and governeth all things; and that of man He is plea&s;ed to require gratitude and obedi|ence.&mdash;Gratitude for ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed and daily en|joyed; and obedience to His commands and will, to pre|pare him for the enjoyment of peace and happine&s;s in the world to come, with angels and arch-angels, who <HI>there</HI> &s;hine brighter than the &s;tarry firmament forever and ever.</P>
<P>The&s;e commands, or the&s;e things which we are ordered to do, He hath been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to make known in the Scriptures, in &s;o plain and &s;imple a manner, that with a very little attention and care, we may obtain a perfect knowledge of our duty, or of what we mu&s;t do to obtain the glorious prize, an inheritance in the Heaven of Heavens.</P>
<P>The great and gracious purpo&s;e, for which you and all mankind were created into this &s;tate of exi&s;tence, is, that ye &s;hould &s;erve and glorify your Creator God in this world, and, in the world to come, enjoy a happine&s;s &s;o pure and exalted, that no human heart can conceive its greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>For the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e great purpo&s;es, all the obedience or &s;ervice, required of us by the Almighty, is of &s;uch a nature, that it contributeth, even in this life, to our own happine&s;s. Should we not therefore, yield with much plea&s;ure, &s;uch obedience?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if a life of obedience end in an eternity of bli&s;s, how &s;hould we reverence, love and adore that gra|cious Being who hath been plea&s;ed to make us capable of &s;uch exqui&s;ive felicity?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025223_0006_0FCCA748CBEF86D8">Thus, my dear children&mdash;I hope it appeareth clearly to you, that to <HI>&s;erve God,</HI> and <HI>keep His commandments,</HI> is our be&s;t intere&s;t. And ye will probably think that all men cheerfully perform that &s;ervice, which mu&s;t end &s;o highly to their advantage.&mdash;But this, alas! is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>When man was fir&s;t created, his mind was pure, and his heart took plea&s;ure, in obeying and wor&s;hipping his Almighty Creator. But in this happy &s;tate of innocence, he did not continue long. He di&s;obeyed the command|ments of his God, and incurred guilt, although he knew it endangered his eternal peace, and expo&s;ed him to the dreadful di&s;plea&s;ure of the King of Heaven.</P>
<P>This act of di&s;obedience is called the fall of Adam, or the fall of man; and a di&s;mal fall it hath proved to be to all the human race.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t your minds to &s;ee and under&s;tand the good, and to avoid the evil, is the purpo&s;e of my meeting you now: And, if God &s;pare me, I hope to meet you often on the &s;ame important bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But if ye do not attend with de&s;ire to improve; if ye do not keep in your minds and practice the advice I give you, my earne&s;t endeavours to in&s;truct you, will all prove fruitle&s;s and vain.</P>
<P>But that they may not prove thus vain, ye &s;hould im|plore the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven. For from Him cometh every good and perfect gift; and every ble&s;&s;ing that we enjoy or hope for, is the free gift of His mercy.</P>
<P>To &s;erve the Lord our God with true, faithful, and willing hearts, is, as I before ob&s;erved, the grand bu&s;ine&s;s that we have to do in this world. It is inculcated, gene|rally, throughout the Scriptures; but in different places, it is expre&s;&s;ed in different terms. In our text the command is conveyed by the word, remember&mdash;"Remember now thy Creator."</P>
<P>When ye are told to remember any thing, ye all know it is meant, that ye &s;hould have it often in your thoughts, and give it your attention. But when ye are told to re|member your Creator, it is intended that ye &s;hould think of Him always, or very often, with <HI>reverence, gratitude,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="025223_0007_0FCCA74A7132E110">
and <HI>love</HI>&mdash;with reverence, with a re&s;pect like that ye have for your parents, but much more exalted. This will prevent your di&s;obedience, and induce you to keep all His commandments.</P>
<P>With gratitude&mdash;becau&s;e He gave you life, and giv|eth you health, food, raiment, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of this world; and if ye will be good here, He will make you completely happy in the world to come, and grant you to &s;hine in the brightne&s;s of heavenly glory forever and ever.</P>
<P>Again, ye mu&s;t think of Him with love.&mdash;Ye &s;hould love Him above all things, becau&s;e, He hath &s;o loved you, and poured upon you &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings; and hath been moreover, plea&s;ed to tell you how ye may obtain a life of eternal happine&s;s, and a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the kingdom of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, where there is glo|ry and bli&s;s, beyond every thing ye can now conceive, and which &s;hall be yours forever.</P>
<P>Thus the pious P&s;almi&s;t declareth his love&mdash;"Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide Thee."&mdash;Such, my dear chil|dren, &s;hould be your love al&s;o.</P>
<P>And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us commandeth that "we love the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our &s;oul." For He mu&s;t be wor&s;hipped in truth; but how can ye perform &s;uch wor&s;hip, unle&s;s your hearts be wholly devoted to Him?</P>
<P>Solomon, the penman of our text, was highly favored of Heaven, and hath been always celebrated for wi&s;dom. Much &s;earch did he make after happine&s;s: But having tri|ed all experiments that imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, he was convinced, that man's intere&s;t and happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ervice of his God, and that every thing el&s;e beneath the &s;un, is altogether vanity, and therefore unfit to be made the object of our de&s;ires or pur&s;uits. Hence he &s;olemnly a&s;|&s;erteth, that the whole duty of man is, <HI>to fear God,</HI> and <HI>keep his Commandments.</HI> And that he may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> better and more ea&s;ily perform this great duty, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to the practice of it early in life&mdash;"Remember <HI>now</HI> thy Cre|ator in the days of thy youth."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025223_0008_0FCCA74BB188C940">To induce you to this pious practice, I beg you to con|&s;ider, that the Supreme Being hath been graciou&s;ly plea&s;|ed to &s;peak you into life&mdash;that although ye mu&s;t &s;oon leave this world, yet He will place you in another, which &s;hall never end, and in which, if ye remember and &s;erve Him here, ye &s;hall be completely happy for ever and e|ver, that in this life, ye are ble&s;t with all things nece&s;|&s;ary for your &s;upport and comfort; and that all the&s;e things flow <HI>immediately,</HI> from the goodne&s;s, and mercy of that Supreme Being; and that to Him ye are accountable for your manner of u&s;ing tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and for every thing el&s;e that ye do. For I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that the Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us that, "God will bring into judgment, every work and every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil."</P>
<P>Reflect often I be&s;eech you, my dear children, upon the&s;e things. Acknowledge with thankful hearts, the goodne&s;s of the Almighty&mdash;Con&s;ider, that He &s;eeth and knoweth all that ye do; all that ye &s;ay, and even all that ye think. Therefore ye &s;hould earne&s;tly endeavor to keep your minds, your words, and your actions, as free from wickedne&s;s as ye po&s;&s;ibly can. If ye earne&s;tly endeavour to do this, and pray to God to give you grace and &s;trength to live as ye ought, in remembrance of Him, He will mo&s;t cer|tainly hear your prayer and do whatever He &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary for you.</P>
<P>For His mercy is infinite, and He withholdeth no good thing from them that walk uprightly and remember Him &s;o as to live in his fear.</P>
<P>But in this exhortation or command ye &s;hould particu|larly ob&s;erve, the time appointed for remembering your Creator&mdash;It is <HI>now;</HI> the time pre&s;ent&mdash;the days of thy youth&mdash;To ob&s;erve this injunction, and to perform <HI>now</HI> that great and e&s;&s;ential duty, is of the utmo&s;t importance to you.</P>
<P>For if ye remember your Creator in the days of your youth: or if whil&s;t ye are young, and free from the cares of the world, ye do your duty as good children ought, and avoid every thing that is bad, ye will e&s;cape all that mi&s;ery, which every kind of wickedne&s;s createth
<PB N="7" REF="025223_0009_0FCC91D6B2904278">
in the mind, and which unle&s;s it be repented of, will ex|clude tho&s;e who commit it, from everla&s;ting re&s;t and the un&s;peakable joys of Heaven.</P>
<P>And unle&s;s ye thus remember your Creator whil&s;t ye are young, ye will fall into tho&s;e vicious pur&s;uits and practices, to which youth (and indeed old age) are but too much inclined, and which, if indulged, will make a dreadful &s;eparation, between the Almighty and your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, to live in &s;in, is to live in enmity again&s;t the great and holy Creator: and that enmity, whil&s;t it con|tinueth, is wor&s;e than death or lo&s;s of the pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>If the prime of your life, if the days of your, youth &s;hould be &s;pent thus, unhappily, in the practice of wick|edne&s;s, when old age &s;hall approach, and infirmities of body tell you, <HI>life is nearly at an end,</HI> ye &s;hall find it a difficult ta&s;k indeed to withdraw your minds from &s;uch practices&mdash;The force of habit is very great, and bad ha|bits are not ea&s;ily broken.</P>
<P>But for your comfort and encouragement, good habits are al&s;o powerful. If ye accu&s;tom your&s;elves to &s;ay your Prayers, as ye ought, at lea&s;t twice in every day, and to give thanks to God for the mercies, which you daily enjoy,&mdash;if ye carefully avoid every thing that is wicked or bad; if ye be dutiful to your parents, and obliging to one another,&mdash;if ye live as it becometh you to live; if ye remember your Creator, and &s;trive to do what, in the &s;cripture, He is plea&s;ed to tell you to do, ye will have very great plea&s;ure in &s;uch conduct, and ye will find, as ye grow in years, that ye will have le&s;s and le&s;s de&s;ire, to pur&s;ue tho&s;e vicious cour&s;es, in which bad children, and bad children only, are fond of indulging them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But if ye will not be per&s;uaded thus to remember your Creator in the days of your youth; the mi&s;erable con&s;e|quence is, ye will become fixed in vice, and &s;inful ac|tions; &s;o that as ye grow up, ye will find but little de|&s;ire to turn unto God; neither will ye have plea&s;ure in obeying His commandments. So that if the change from
<PB N="8" REF="025223_0010_0FCCA74EC3245A10">
bad conduct to good conduct be ever effected, it will co&s;t you much trouble and grief of heart.&mdash;But all this, and many other great evils will be avoided, if ye obey the text; and great, un&s;peakably great will be the gain of your reward. It will be eternal life, that is, eternal happine&s;s in the Heaven of Heavens.</P>
<P>Death is the fruit, or wages of &s;in. But although we mu&s;t all die, yet by the wonderful power of God, we &s;hall have a future exi&s;tence. In that &s;tate of exi&s;tence, if we have done wickedly in this world, we &s;hall &s;uffer &s;evere puni&s;hment: but if, happily, we &s;hall have done the will of our heavenly Father, we &s;hall receive a great, an infinite reward, and be happy throughout eter|nity</P>
<P>Remember then, my dear children, that your greate&s;t care &s;hould be, to keep your minds as free as po&s;&s;i|ble, from &s;pot or &s;tain, and to avoid every thing that is bad.</P>
<P>Ye live in a wicked world, where, to our &s;hame, vice aboundeth. But ye daily receive u&s;eful in&s;truction within the&s;e walls. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Richmond Academy.</NOTE> And I tru&s;t your parents al&s;o, take care to teach you the things that are right.</P>
<P>Lay up then in your hearts, I be&s;eech you, and care|fully remember what I have now been telling you, and ye &s;hall hereafter receive much comfort and benefit from them.</P>
<P>And as a farther inducement for you to lead virtuous lives, and to &s;hun whatever is ba&s;e, evil or wicked; con|&s;ider if ye live thus, and be good children, ye will have the e&s;teem of all who know you&mdash;and above all, your Father who is in heaven will love you and He will ble&s;s you; and when, in His providence, He &s;hall be plea&s;ed to call you hence, He will receive you into his man&s;ions of everla&s;ting peace and joy: and there, with all the heavenly ho&s;ts, ye will &s;urround the throne of the MOST HIGH GOD, and in rapturous bli&s;s, &s;ing ho|&s;annas to the King of kings, and unto the LAMB for ever and ever.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025223_0011_0FCCA7504061F620">The Lord of his infinite mercy give you grace, &s;o to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, that ye may be all prepared for the enjoyment of this &s;upreme and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and to His great name be glory, honor and prai&s;e for ever and for ever. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry that I have been &s;o long deprived of the plea&s;ure of meeting you here: and I pray God, our Heavenly Father, graciou&s;ly to grant His ble&s;&s;ing to attend our pre&s;ent meeting, for the glory of His great name, and the good of our immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Humbly, but fervently to offer up our prayers and our prai&s;e to our Creator God, is one of our fir&s;t and greate&s;t duties.&mdash;That He is plea&s;ed to permit, and even to com|mand us, thus to addre&s;s Him, is a very great privilege; and, if rightly performed, it will very much promote our happine&s;s even in this life: but what is of much greater con&s;equence, it will contribute to our preparation, for that happine&s;s, which the good, and only the good, enjoy in heaven forever.</P>
<P>In order to induce us the more earne&s;tly to pray to our heavenly Father, we are a&s;&s;ured, that if we a&s;k any thing agreeable to His will, He is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to hear us; and if we keep his commandments, He will mercifully give us whatever He &s;hall judge proper and nece&s;&s;ary for us.</P>
<P>Thus encouraged, we &s;hould endeavor to know in what manner it becometh us to approach the throne of heavenly grace.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, whil&s;t in the world &s;uffering for our benefit, was plea&s;ed to give us a form of prayer, and to make a few remarks &s;hewing us how we &s;hould perform that great duty.</P>
<P>This form of prayer ye may find in the &s;ixth chapter
<PB N="10" REF="025223_0012_0FCCA755A319EE70">
of St. Matthew's go&s;pel; and in the ninth ver&s;e, it begin|neth thus:</P>
<P><HI>Our Father which art in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The words <HI>Our Father,</HI> are de&s;igned to rai&s;e in our minds that reverence and love which are mo&s;t ju&s;tly due to &s;o great and good a Being. They likewi&s;e teach you to have confidence in His mercy. For, as He di&s;po&s;eth of all events, &s;o He will make all things work together for the good of tho&s;e, who love Him, and keep His commandments.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e words likewi&s;e give you this plea&s;ing a&s;&s;urance, that, as a father pitieth, or is tender and kind to his children; &s;o your heavenly Father will, of His great mercy, pity, &s;upport, and comfort you, during your confinement to this vain world, in which di&s;appointments and &s;orrows are &s;o often the portion of the children of men.</P>
<P>To love your neighbour is repeatedly commanded. But, in &s;cripture language, the word <HI>neighbour</HI> compre|hendeth all mankind. This is alluded to in the word <HI>Our;</HI> which teacheth, that ye &s;hould con&s;ider God, the Father Almighty, as the common Father of all the human race; and therefore that ye &s;hould con&s;ider all men as your brothers.</P>
<P>If this truth were generally believed, and &s;uffered to direct the conduct of men, the world would be much better than it is; and mankind would avoid many of tho&s;e evils, with which they are afflicted. But though others neglect their duty; that will not excu&s;e you, if, unhappily, ye neglect yours.</P>
<P>Young as ye are, ye mu&s;t have &s;ome notion of the plea&s;ure of living in this friendly manner; and in being obliging, each to the other. For, I have the great &s;a|tisfaction to hear, that ye &s;pend your days in this hou&s;e, in that quiet, and peaceable manner, in which brothers and &s;i&s;ters &s;hould live together.&mdash;Such a life is delightful to tho&s;e, who have the goodne&s;s to practice it; and it is well plea&s;ing unto the great God of peace and love, who hath been plea&s;ed, in His great goodne&s;s, to make your duty, your true and real happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025223_0013_0FCCA7574F7FA6C0">To do good to all men in the world, is not in your power; neither is it required of you. But it is required that ye be well di&s;po&s;ed towards all men, and be ready to do them good offices, whenever an opportunity pre|&s;enteth&mdash;that ye bear malice and ill-will again&s;t no man, and implore for all, the ble&s;&s;ing of your Father who is in Heaven.</P>
<P>Thus the words <HI>Our Father,</HI> imply that ye &s;hould pray for His goodne&s;s to be extended unto all, &s;o that, through His grace, they as well as you, may be enabled always to do that which is right, and acceptable unto Him.</P>
<P>The&s;e words likewi&s;e direct, that ye offer up your prayers with the greate&s;t reverence and deepe&s;t humility. Ye treat your earthly parents with re&s;pect, and that is your duty. Much more then, my dear children, is it your duty, to be humble and meek, when ye addre&s;s your&s;elves in prayer to your Father in Heaven. For He knoweth your hearts, and all the imaginations of your mind.</P>
<P>Therefore, when ye are going to pray to your Father in Heaven, ye mu&s;t rai&s;e your mind to the highe&s;t degree of re&s;pect, and reverence, and love. It is impo&s;&s;ible to have as much re&s;pect as is due to a Being &s;o &s;upremely great and good.</P>
<P>But when ye addre&s;s Him in your private prayers, ye need not lift up your voice. For it is not the &s;ound of your voice; but the di&s;po&s;ition of your heart and mind, that your Father in Heaven regardeth. Ye mu&s;t like|wi&s;e endeavor to have your whole heart engaged in prayer, and not to &s;uffer your thoughts to wander from the &s;olemn duty&mdash;Ye mu&s;t with all your &s;oul de&s;ire to be heared.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t ye are engaged in the &s;olemn act of prayer, it will be improper for your thoughts to run after any thing el&s;e, or to be employed about tho&s;e things, which, at other times, might u&s;efully engage <HI>them,</HI> or innocently amu&s;e <HI>you.</HI> When ye &s;hall be &s;o happy as to be able thus to re&s;train your thoughts, &s;o that they accompany your words, ye will have gained a great point, and your
<PB N="12" REF="025223_0014_0FCCA7592CBB5EC8">
plea&s;ure in praying will be much greater than I can ex|pre&s;s, or ye now conceive.</P>
<P>But if ye do not enjoy this plea&s;ure always when ye pray, ye mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged. Per&s;evere in your duty with patience and hope; and your heavenly Father, knowing your &s;incerity, will, in His own good time, grant the de&s;ire of your &s;oul.</P>
<P>At your years, &s;ome of you at lea&s;t, cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed capable of under&s;tanding, in its full force, the na|ture and importance of thus praying to God your hea|venly Father. But if ye daily continue the practice, ye will habitually acquire re&s;pect and reverence for Him, who is the Pre&s;erver of your life: And your minds will receive light and knowledge of this, and of every other duty, much &s;ooner than, perhaps, ye now imagine ye can.</P>
<P>In your ta&s;ks at &s;chool, ye often meet with difficulties: But, by often trying, ye at la&s;t overcome all tho&s;e dif|ficulties. So it is in matters of religion, and in the du|ties by it enjoyed. The more ye &s;trive to overcome dif|ficulties, in re&s;training your thoughts, and in governing your mind, the fewer difficulties ye will find; and as tho&s;e difficulties le&s;&s;en, your plea&s;ures will naturally in|crea&s;e. This is &s;acred truth, and it is great encourage|ment for per&s;evering in your duty.</P>
<P>Again. <HI>Our Father Who art in Heaven,</HI> teach you to rai&s;e your thoughts from this vain world, as the P&s;almi&s;t rai&s;ed his.&mdash;"Unto Thee, O Lord, lift I up my &s;oul." For as your father is in Heaven, thither ought your thoughts al&s;o to a&s;cend; but more particularly when ye are engaged in the &s;olemnity of prayer.</P>
<P>The&s;e words likewi&s;e teach, that this world is not your place of re&s;idence; that this life mu&s;t come to an end; that heaven is your home, and that as heaven is a place of holine&s;s, ye mu&s;t &s;trive, with all the powers of your &s;oul, to obtain as much holine&s;s as can be obtained in this life. For without holine&s;s, ye never can be <HI>receiv|ed</HI> into any of the man&s;ions of your heavenly Father's hou&s;e, in which pure and holy &s;pirits are enraptured with eternal bli&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="025223_0015_0FCCA75B84539EC8">In fine, the&s;e introductory words, <HI>our Father, Who art in Heaven,</HI> imply that the Supreme Being, to whom ye addre&s;s your prayers, is able to grant your reque&s;ts, if they be &s;uch as He approveth, and be offered up in &s;incerity and truth. The term <HI>Father</HI> implieth, that He is <HI>willing</HI> to grant them, and to &s;hew you His mercy, even to the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls. And the term <HI>Our Father,</HI> implieth, that He hath no re&s;pect to per&s;ons: But as He created all, &s;o He will have mercy upon all, if they will but look upon Him as their Father, and tru&s;t for mercy in Him alone.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when ye approach His pre&s;ence, or when ye pray to Him, your minds &s;hould be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with <HI>reverence, humility,</HI> and <HI>fear.</HI> Becau&s;e He is in Heaven, and ye upon earth, and al&s;o with <HI>confidence</HI> and <HI>love;</HI> becau&s;e ye pray to your Father, Who know|eth and will pity your infirmities, and will freely give whatever His wi&s;dom &s;hall judge proper for you, if ye will fervently a&s;k in the manner in which ye ought to a&s;k, that is, with &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and impre&s;&s;ions as I have now de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>For when ye &s;o a&s;k, or when ye &s;o pray unto Him, ye &s;hew your obedience, and confe&s;s your dependence: And unle&s;s ye become obedient, and place in Him your whole tru&s;t and confidence, ye need not look for, nor expect the great ble&s;&s;ing of His favor, either in this life, or in that which is to come.</P>
<P>But to obtain His favor, which is infinitely better than life, too much ye cannot do. It is indeed the only need|ful and valuable thing that ye can by any means obtain. It is life, it is glory; it is happine&s;s and eternal bli&s;s.&mdash; Bli&s;s that can never change, that can never fail to tran&s;|port pour &s;ouls with rapturous delight; and it mu&s;t en|dure, like your &s;ouls, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your endeavors to obtain this great, this glorious prize, that &s;hall make you rich in happine&s;s throughout eternity&punc; is the object of my di&s;cour&s;es with you, which I &s;hall, for that rea&s;on, pur&s;ue with very great plea&s;ure. For it will be a particular happine&s;s to me, if, with the ble&s;&s;ing of our Father in heaven, I hap|pily
<PB N="14" REF="025223_0016_0FCCA75F6E7E7B28">
become an in&s;trument in guiding you to His great &s;alvation. And that ye may obtain it&mdash;that ye may at la&s;t be rai&s;ed to the communion and fellow&s;hip of His holy angels, and the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of the ju&s;t, I be&s;eech you carefully to remember what hath been now &s;aid, and diligently to do, as ye &s;hall acquire knowledge, all tho&s;e things, which the Lord your God requireth you to do.</P>
<P>And I fervently pray to God, our heavenly Father, of His great goodne&s;s to grant you grace, and to &s;upport and &s;trengthen you with His holy &s;pirit, &s;o that ye may pa&s;s this life in His fear, and when this life &s;hall be ended (as &s;oon it mu&s;t) to receive you into His king|dom of glory everla&s;ting, where ye &s;hall &s;hine brighter than the moon and the &s;tars forever and ever.</P>
<P>Hear now our prayer, O merciful Father! we be&s;eech Thee to hear us, for the &s;ake of thine only &s;on our Lord, and to thy great name be the glory and prai&s;e for ever and forever. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE I &s;ucceeded la&s;t Sunday in my endeavors to explain to your under&s;tanding, with what temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind ye &s;hould offer up your prayers to your Father in heaven: al&s;o, what the purport or mean|ing is of the preface or fir&s;t words of that which is com|monly called THE LORD's PRAYER.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now begin upon the petitions, which it contain|eth; and although the&s;e are all di&s;tinct and &s;eparate in their own literal meaning; yet each part &s;o dependeth upon the other, that there is a connexion throughout the whole.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e petitions is expre&s;&s;ed thus, <HI>Hallowed be Thy Name.</HI></P>
<P>This implieth an earne&s;t de&s;ire in you, that your hea|venly Father be held in the utmo&s;t re&s;pect by all the
<PB N="15" REF="025223_0017_0FCCA760AEC44E28">
world:&mdash;and that as His great name is perfectly &s;acred, &s;o it &s;hould never be u&s;ed by men, but with the mo&s;t profound veneration and awe.</P>
<P>We read in the Bible that "The Lord ble&s;&s;ed the Sabbath day and hallowed it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exodus</HI> 20.11.</NOTE> and that the temple was hallowed,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kings</HI> 9.3.7.</NOTE> that is, they were &s;et apart for particu|lar purpo&s;es; and to <HI>be kept holy unto the Lord.</HI> The Sabbath day was &s;et apart from worldly labor, and de|&s;igned for devotion, and other religious exerci&s;es; and not for mirth and frolic, as it is now too often u&s;ed:&mdash; and the temple, was u&s;ed like our churches, for the a&s;|&s;embling of the people, to offer up their prayers, and their prai&s;e to the mo&s;t High and to hear His law expounded.</P>
<P>Thus were they both hallowed, both &s;et apart for ho|ly u&s;es, and con&s;idered as things &s;acred, and devoted un|to God <HI>and His particular &s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore in this petition ye pray, that your heavenly Father may be ever thought and &s;poken of with godly fear:&mdash;that men humble them&s;elves, and exalt Him in their hearts, and pay Him that homage which is due to the Creator and Father of all, who alone can give happi|ne&s;s to tho&s;e who love and &s;erve Him; and inflict mi&s;ery upon the &s;corners that profane His &s;acred name.</P>
<P>But the&s;e words, <HI>thy name,</HI> imply God Him&s;elf with all His attributes of ju&s;tice, power, wi&s;dom, mercy and truth; and that He be prai&s;ed and glorified for them, as well as for all His wonderful works, and the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of His providence; of which the mo&s;t amazing and wonderful is the plan of redemption, accompli&s;hed by Him, who compo&s;ed this prayer. And this my beloved children, &s;hould endear it to you, that it was de&s;igned for your in&s;truction by Him, who &s;uffered and did for your benefit, infinitely more than ever man did or could do for his friends.</P>
<P>This petition, likewi&s;e, teacheth, that ye &s;hould never &s;uffer your&s;elves to u&s;e His &s;acred name lightly or profane|ly. I mean in cur&s;ing or &s;wearing, (which is a very
<PB N="16" REF="025223_0018_0FCCA7622C7E9C18">
wicked, but common practice in the world) or in com|mon di&s;cour&s;e, upon frivolous occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In &s;urprize or merriment it is become fa&s;hionable to exclaim, good God! or to u&s;e &s;ome expe&s;&s;ion of that <HI>great name.</HI> But this is a grievous &s;in and I hope ye will never be guilty of it. For it is taking His name in vain; and ye know the commandment &s;aith, "The Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s, who taketh His name in vain."</P>
<P>But as I wi&s;h to explain this petition as clearly as I can, I &s;hall put it into this form.</P>
<P>O Lord! Our heavenly Father! we be&s;eech Thee to enlighten our minds, that we may know Thee, as we ought; and love and reverence Thee above all things&mdash; Adore&punc; Thee in all Thy attributes; honor Thee in all that we do, and promote Thy glory by a life of obedience to Thy commandments.</P>
<P>The next petition is, <HI>Thy Kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>As the fir&s;t petition &s;heweth that the prai&s;e and glory of God, &s;hould be the fir&s;t and great de&s;ire of all chri&s;|tians, &s;o this petition &s;heweth how that is to be accom|pli&s;hed or fulfilled.</P>
<P>As our heavenly Father is &s;upreme over all, and or|dereth or permitteth all things; &s;o all creation is His king|dom. But the kingdom meant in this petition, is the kingdom of grace, or of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is begun in this world, but is made perfect in the world to come. For in this world, no man can live altogether free from &s;in: but in the next world, tho&s;e who have been &s;o wi&s;e as to become &s;ubjects of the kingdom of grace, or to live pious and godly lives, will be made pure and perfect in holine&s;s. For no &s;in, nor any thing that loveth &s;in, can ever approach the man&s;ions of eternal bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore when ye &s;ay, <HI>Thy Kingdom come,</HI> ye pray that it be e&s;tabli&s;hed in your hearts. That is&mdash;that your heavenly Father would plea&s;e to grant you grace that you may be enabled to &s;erve Him, and keep all his com|mandments with a &s;incere and willing heart. That ye may hate and abhor &s;in, and every thing that is di&s;plea|&s;ing unto God&mdash;that ye may ever love what is good; and
<PB N="17" REF="025223_0019_0FCCA7652DB09C08">
likewi&s;e, that all men may love and practice holine&s;s, and live to the prai&s;e and glory of their great Creator.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of righteou&s;ne&s;s in your hearts, your growing in grace, or being good, is a coming or increa&s;e of His kingdom upon earth&mdash;Extremely happy will ye be, my children, when ye &s;hall really have this love of God, and of that which is good in His &s;ight, or is com|manded by Him in the &s;criptures, fixed firmly in your hearts. The re&s;trictions of religion will not then ap|pear grievous; but all its ways, and all the duties it re|quireth, will appear to you plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t again put you in mind, that when ye repeat the&s;e words, <HI>Thy kingdom come,</HI> ye &s;hould have an ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire to become good or to be better than ye are; and that the love of God may &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;s your minds, as to govern you in all your actions, and even your thoughts, and &s;o re&s;train you from wilfully or willingly doing a bad action upon any account. For although bad actions may gratify you for the pre&s;ent, or an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;e or wi&s;h; yet be a&s;&s;ured, my dear children, that in the end, they will prove to you the cau&s;e of much and la&s;ting &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The third petition is thus expre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;"Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven."</P>
<P><HI>Thy will be done,</HI> implieth your acquie&s;cence with the di&s;pen&s;ations of your heavenly Father; or, that ye give up your own wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, and rather would that whatever He willeth, may come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>This re&s;ignation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to His will, &s;hall prove to you an endle&s;s &s;ource of happine&s;s. Sickne&s;s, cro&s;&s;es, and a variety of affliction, are often the portion even of pious men in this life: And if they, or any of them, &s;hould befall you, to bear them with patience and meek|ne&s;s, will very much le&s;&s;en the affliction: And if ye are thus &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obedient, your heavenly Father will &s;upport and comfort you with His Holy Spirit. But if ye fret or murmur, whil&s;t ye &s;uffer affliction, that mur|muring will greatly enhance the evil in your minds, and it will offend your heavenly Father. Becau&s;e, whil&s;t ye murmur again&s;t any thing that He doth, ye behave like
<PB N="18" REF="025223_0020_0FCCA766B29E7F00">
di&s;obedient children, and find fault with the wi&s;dom of His government.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides being re&s;igned, ye mu&s;t be obedient to His commandments, delivered in the Scriptures for your improvement in pious knowledge, and for your guide through life. In the&s;e in&s;tructions or commands, the will of our heavenly Father is revealed, as far as it is nece&s;&s;ary for man to know it in this world; and by faith|fully ob&s;erving and obeying them, ye will be prepared for Chri&s;t's kingdom of eternal glory, into which, if ye become <HI>good</HI> here, ye will be received after death, and there ye &s;hall &s;hine brighter, than the &s;un in exqui&s;ite bli&s;s, forever and ever.</P>
<P>The words, <HI>in earth,</HI> imply an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that all mankind, as well as you, may have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their duty to your heavenly Father, and have the grace to di&s;charge it with faithful and willing hearts; or with &s;incerity and truth.</P>
<P>This part of the petition may be rendered thus:</P>
<P>O Lord, our heavenly Father, who&s;e power di&s;po&s;eth of us, and of all things as &s;eemeth unto Thee meet; grant us grace to obey Thee in every thing; to deny the gratification of &s;uch affections as are contrary to Thy pure and holy precepts. Give us, we humbly be&s;eech Thee, a true knowledge of our duty, and create in us a full and perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Thy &s;acred will, &s;o that we may walk humbly before Thee, with that reverence and fear, which is mo&s;t ju&s;tly due unto Thee, our Fa|ther, our King, and our God.</P>
<P><HI>As it is in Heaven.</HI> Perhaps there may be a difficul|ty in conveying to your under&s;tanding the real meaning of the&s;e words. Becau&s;e angels and &s;aints perform His will in heaven, in a degree of perfection, that is not at|tainable in this life. Yet &s;till to a&s;pire after &s;uch per|fection, &s;hould be your wi&s;h and practice, and the more earne&s;tly ye do &s;o, the nearer to it &s;hall ye come, and the greater &s;atisfaction &s;hall ye have in the performance of all your duties. This &s;atisfaction will induce a &s;in|cere and chearful compliance, and obedience: And in that &s;incerity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, ye will imitate the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits
<PB N="19" REF="025223_0021_0FCCA76830E2B5A0">
in heaven; who never become faint or weary in doing their duty, or in performing the ble&s;&s;ed ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned them.</P>
<P>By the&s;e words, then, ye are to under&s;tand, that ye implore your heavenly Father to give you true and &s;in|cere hearts, and a right &s;pirit, that ye may not deceive your&s;elves; but that with all your mind, and with all your &s;trength, ye may be enabled to do whatever He hath been plea&s;ed to command you, with &s;incerity, fer|vency and zeal. Or that ye may be wholly devoted to His &s;ervice, and as perfectly obedient as it becometh the children of the Father of mercies.</P>
<P>Thus my beloved children, I have endeavoured to ex|plain to you the&s;e three great petitions; the &s;ub&s;tance or which is this.</P>
<P>Ye implore your heavenly Father, that out of the riches of His grace, He would be plea&s;ed to enable you and all men, to glorify His great and holy name, by chearfully &s;ubmitting to his will, and faithfully perform|ing tho&s;e things which he hath commanded to be done, and that, in mercy to &s;inful man, He would be gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ha&s;ten the time, when all the world &s;hall acknowlege Him to be the Lord, and their God, and, through a &s;incere love of Him, turn from the evil of their ways, and do only that which is lawful and right before Him all their days, until He &s;hall be plea&s;|ed to call them to His man&s;ions of everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>My dear children, beloved in the Lord, <HI>I</HI> be&s;eech you to think often of the&s;e things, and be a&s;&s;ured that if ye live in this manner, according to the &s;pirit and meaning of this prayer, ye will in this life be &s;en&s;ible that ye enjoy the &s;avor of your heavenly Father, who will give you every needful ble&s;&s;ing: and in the life to come, ye will inherit, with angels and with &s;aints in light, in glory, and in bli&s;s to all eternity.</P>
<P>And that ye may &s;o live, and be &s;o forever ble&s;&s;ed, I pray God our heavenly Father, of His infinite mercy to grant for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, our Lord, and to His great and glorious name be the prai&s;e forever and for ever. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have examined tho&s;e parts of this excellent Prayer, which have particular re&s;pect to the Deity, and in which ye, with reverence and humility, pray that your heavenly Father may be glorified by all mankind: And that His high kingdom of grace may come, or that righteou&s;ne&s;s be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed in the hearts of all men, that His will may be obeyed as chearfully and &s;incerely upon earth as it is in Heaven.</P>
<P>We are now come to tho&s;e petitions, which more im|mediately refer to our&s;elves, and our brethren; and in the eleventh ver&s;e, the fir&s;t of them is thus expre&s;&s;ed:</P>
<P><HI>Give us this day our daily bread.</HI> In this petition, ye a&s;k of your heavenly Father, &s;uch things as He &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;upport in life: And ye acknow|ledge your dependence upon His bounty and will, from which proceedeth every good thing re&s;pecting this life, and the life that is to come.</P>
<P>Neither is it a general dependence that ye acknow|ledge; but a daily and particular one. Ye do not a&s;k for riches, a great abundance of the comforts of life, af|ter which the covetous &s;eek. But ye a&s;k for food conve|nient, or &s;uch as &s;hall enable you to perform the offices of life, and duties of a chri&s;tian, without having the cares and apprehen&s;ions of want to di&s;turb your minds.</P>
<P>Submi&s;&s;ion to the will of your heavenly Father, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of His providence, is likewi&s;e confe&s;&s;ed, and, as St. Peter expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;ye ca&s;t all your care upon Him, who careth for you <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Peter,</HI> 5.7.</NOTE> and who will never for&s;ake, or withdraw His protection from tho&s;e who thus put their tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>The words <HI>us</HI> and <HI>our,</HI> remind you, that &s;uch gene|ral ble&s;&s;ings as ye implore for your&s;elves, ye &s;hould like|wi&s;e implore for others, that is, for all mankind. One great leading principle in the chri&s;tian religion is, to in|culcate benevolence, or a general good will to all the
<PB N="21" REF="025223_0023_0FCCA76D6ECFA868">
human race. As your heavenly Father freely giveth you, &s;o ought ye freely to mini&s;ter to the wants of others, and be ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>My children&mdash;thus to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed is, perhaps, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that can be extracted from wealth, and if tho&s;e upon whom wealth is be&s;towed did but know how exalted a plea&s;ure it is, they would &s;o act the faith|ful &s;tewards of the Lord, that little &s;hould we find of that wretchedne&s;s, which poverty createth in the world.</P>
<P>And always remember, that pro&s;perity enjoineth much thankfulne&s;s to the bountiful Giver: and adver&s;ity or af|fliction teacheth patience and re&s;ignation, as well as the extreme folly of placing your affections on the vanities of this world. For whoever tru&s;teth in them, will ru|in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>The next petition is in the&s;e words: <HI>And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.</HI></P>
<P>My children, this petition is of immen&s;e con&s;equence. For unle&s;s ye forgive others, ye by this petition bind down upon your&s;elves the wrath of Heaven.</P>
<P>In the &s;criptures, debts and debtors, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, offences and offenders, are u&s;ed to imply nearly the &s;ame thing. So here, <HI>our debts,</HI> mean our offences again&s;t the law of God: and <HI>our debtors</HI> mean tho&s;e, who in any wi&s;e commit injuries or offences again&s;t us.</P>
<P>In this petition then ye acknowlege ye are &s;inners, but through His great goodne&s;s ye hope and pray to be forgiven. But of this pardoning mercy ye can have no hopes, unle&s;s ye forgive tho&s;e, who injure or offend you. For the words of this petition expre&s;sly mean, that ye pray for mercy only as, or on condition that ye are for|giving and merciful to others.</P>
<P>Therefore ye mu&s;t not &s;uffer to remain in your mind malice or ill-will again&s;t any; but live in charity and have friendly di&s;po&s;itions towards all. The&s;e charitable di&s;po&s;itions not only conduce to happine&s;s in this life, but to a preparation of the &s;oul for that felicity, which en|dureth for ever.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed, &s;aith the Lord Je&s;us, ble&s;&s;ed are the merci|ful,
<PB N="22" REF="025223_0024_0FCCA76EEEFA3EC0">
for they &s;hall obtain mercy. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Matt.</HI> 5.7.</NOTE> This &s;hould be, at all times, the di&s;po&s;ition of all chri&s;tians: but in praying for mercy, the mind &s;hould be particularly clean&s;ed from all di&s;plea&s;ure, and every de&s;ire that thir&s;teth for revenge. For unle&s;s ye are indeed mercifully di&s;po&s;ed to others, ye can by no means become the happy object of your heaven|ly Father's mercy.</P>
<P>The Lord pondereth the heart; and if any perver&s;e or uncharitable di&s;po&s;itions, or de&s;ires, are harboured there, He knoweth it. And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord declareth, "when ye &s;tand praying, <HI>forgive</HI> if ye have ought again&s;t any, that your Father al&s;o may forgive you your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; and to enforce the forgiving of others, He addeth, "But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father, who is in heaven, forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Mark</HI> 11.25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>As in the former petition, your dependence for tempo|ral ble&s;&s;ings is acknowledged; &s;o in this, your depen|dence for &s;piritual gifts and graces, is likewi&s;e acknow|ledged. And of this dependence ye &s;hould ever retain a lively and grateful &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>And as ye are directed thus daily to implore the for|givene&s;s of your &s;in, this &s;hould impre&s;s upon your minds, the duty and nece&s;&s;ity of your being patient, and kind one to another. But the forgiving of your &s;ins, is an act of free, unmerited grace in your heavenly Father: Therefore, mo&s;t certainly, ought ye freely to forgive others. And unle&s;s ye thus forgive your enemies, or tho&s;e who offend you, ye cannot hope for the forgivene&s;s of your heavenly Father, who delighteth to &s;hew mercy to the merciful.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the mere act of forgiving injuries, ye &s;hould forget them. For whil&s;t ye remember or think of them, it will be difficult to &s;ay ye have forgiven them: And in this petition, ye in fact pray not to be forgiven, unle&s;s ye al&s;o forgive.</P>
<P>Thus it is the duty and intere&s;t of all to live in amity, and to be charitably di&s;po&s;ed each to the other. Be&s;ides, the advantage derived in this life from &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions,
<PB N="23" REF="025223_0025_0FCCA7706FC1D098">
they con&s;titute much of the happine&s;s of the life to come. Therefore, they mu&s;t be begun here: for in the grave there is neither work nor device. And unle&s;s the&s;e cha|ritable di&s;po&s;itions govern yuor mind, ye will be cruel &amp; vindictive; and it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch &s;pirits to obtain mercy, or to enjoy the happine&s;s which mer|cy createth.</P>
<P>As much of your pre&s;ent happine&s;s dependeth upon tho&s;e charitable di&s;po&s;itions; and as future happine&s;s cannot be obtained without them; I wi&s;h to explain my|&s;elf as clearly to your under&s;tanding, as I po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>Young as ye are, it is very probable, that all of you have been &s;ometimes offended. Ye have been made an|gry, and ye have felt a de&s;ire to revenge, or to puni&s;h. Now, whil&s;t your mind was &s;o inflamed with anger and re&s;entment, did ye not feel unhappy? Could any thing plea&s;e you?</P>
<P>If ye never yet have taken notice of your own unhap|pine&s;s, when your mind hath been in this manner di&s;|&s;turbed, I be&s;eech you to ob&s;erve it on &s;ome future oc|ca&s;ion. If ye do this, ye will much better under&s;tand the nece&s;&s;ity of forgiving others, and of cultivating tho&s;e kindly affections and di&s;po&s;itions, which unite mankind, and in&s;pire all with charity and love. And ye will like|wi&s;e &s;ee, or rather feel from the unea&s;ine&s;s of your mind, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the cruel and vindictive &s;pirits to ta&s;te or enjoy happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you then, my dear children, as ye hope for happine&s;s, and the mercy of your heavenly Father, give not your mind to anger; nor to revenge; neither to uncha|ritablene&s;s: but live in peace and love as it becometh the children of the God of mercy to live. Let not evil &s;peaking pollute your tongue: nor malice, nor envy corrupt your heart. They &s;hould not be, indeed, &s;o much as known or heard among&s;t you.</P>
<P>The la&s;t petition is, <HI>And lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil.</HI></P>
<P>Temptations meaneth incitement to evil: and to be led into temptation, implieth our yielding to it, or being overcome by it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="025223_0026_0FCCA773A7ED6F80">As our heavenly Father is all goodne&s;s, this expre&s;&s;ion may &s;urprize you. But we read that, He cha&s;teneth whom He loveth; and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom He re|ceiveth, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6.</NOTE> He is likewi&s;e &s;aid to tempt them, as in the ca&s;e of Abraham<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 22.</NOTE>. But it is not to lead them into error, it is to try their faith, or to give them opportunities of exerci&s;ing it in a particular manner, to &s;trenghten it and to give good examples to others&mdash;"The Lord your God proveth you to know whether ye love the Lord your God, with all your heart and with all your &s;oul<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 13.3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So that this petition doth not imply a prayer to be kept entirely free from temptations; but that ye may be &s;o &s;trengthened, as not to be overcome by them; or that ye may not be tempted above what ye are able to bear. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e ye are to under&s;tand this expre&s;&s;ion, and not as an enticement to &s;in. For, as St. James ob&s;erv|eth, God tempteth no man, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cor.</HI> 10.23.</NOTE> that is, He induceth no man to commit iniquity.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of enlarging upon the different ways in which your heavenly Father is &s;aid to tempt His children, to prove the &s;incerity of their faith, and to &s;trengthen their minds, I &s;hall paraphra&s;e the petition thus:</P>
<P>"Whenever evil &s;hall befall us&mdash;when the world, the devil, or our own evil de&s;ires, &s;hall attempt to en|&s;nare us, do Thou, O Lord, our heavenly Father, do Thou, in Thy tender mercies&mdash;&s;upport and &s;trengthen us; &s;o that we neither &s;tumble nor fall; but make for us a way to e&s;cape&mdash;enable us to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock, or re&s;cue us from it."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. James</HI> 1.13.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>But deliver us from evil,</HI> may be extended to the evils of this life, &s;uch as lo&s;s of health or of friends, or to the cruel &s;hafts of malice, and &s;o forth. But the chief object of this petition, is a re&s;cue or deliverance from the power of the devil, the contagion of &s;in, the &s;eduction of our own evil de&s;ires, and from every evil frame of heart, and di&s;po&s;ition of &s;pirit, which incline us to &s;in, or to yield to temptations to commit iniquity.</P>
<P>This teacheth, that ye &s;hould be always upon your
<PB N="25" REF="025223_0027_0FCCA775145EFB28">
guard, le&s;t ye fall from duty, and the practice of truth, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. That ye &s;hould with humble, &s;incere, and contrite hearts, lament your own weakne&s;s, and implore your heavenly Father to &s;treng|then you with grace, and the aids of His holy &s;pirit, &s;o that ye may be kept from falling under temptations, and from doing any thing offen&s;ive to His pure and holy eye. And that for His infinite mercies, he would uphold you through this mortal life, and "re&s;tore you to the joy of His &s;alvation."</P>
<P><HI>For Thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>As this prayer beginneth, &s;o it endeth with glory to God, your heavenly Father; which &s;heweth, that whe|ther ye pray, or whatever el&s;e ye do, ye &s;hould have an eye to His glory and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But the&s;e words may be rendered thus:</P>
<P>We pray for the coming of Thy kingdom, or the in|crea&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s; that Thy name may be held &s;acred, and treated with reverence by all mankind; and that Thy will may be done in all things and by all men: For the kingdom is Thine, and it is the duty of all to glorify Thy name, and to obey Thy law: We implore temporal ble&s;&s;ings, and the forgivene&s;s of our pa&s;t of|fences, and a pre&s;ervation from future tran&s;gre&s;&s;ionss; becau&s;e, Thou ha&s;t the power thus to provide for, and protect us, and Thou only can&s;t forgive us our &s;ins. All the&s;e things we implore, becau&s;e by hallowing Thy name; by owning Thy kingdom, and by doing Thy will: by Thy forgiving us, by Thy providing for, and pro|tecting us, the glory &s;hall be Thine, forever and forever. Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Amen</HI> is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to mean a full a&s;&s;ent to your prayers, and earne&s;t de&s;ire that they may be heard. As if ye &s;hould &s;ay, "Grant the&s;e our humble reque&s;ts, good Lord, we be&s;eech Thee." But it al&s;o implieth a hope, and belief that they will be heard, as far as they are agreeable to the will of your heavenly Father, for the &s;ake of His beloved &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, through wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> mediation alone we can have acce&s;s to the Father; who with the &s;on and Holy Spirit, is one God, over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever more. Amen.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="025223_0028_0FCCA7766AE838F0" MS="y">My dear children, I hope the&s;e remarks will enable you to under&s;tand this prayer better than hitherto you have under&s;tood it&mdash;and I pray God our heavenly Fa|ther, to increa&s;e your knowledge of all tho&s;e things, which belong to your eternal peace, that as ye grow in years, ye may increa&s;e in grace; in wi&s;dom, and in under&s;tanding&mdash;that He would protect you through the dangerous paths of youth, and through all the chances and changes of this life&mdash;that all your days may be &s;pent in His fear; that ye be pre&s;erved un&s;pot|ted from the world, and that, at the la&s;t, ye be pre&s;ent|ed with exceeding great joy before His throne, and be|come ble&s;&s;ed partakers with His &s;aints in light everla&s;t|ing.</P>
<P>Grant this, O Lord our heavenly Father, we be&s;eech Thee, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, and to thy great name, be glory, honor and prai&s;e for ever and forever. Amen.</P>
