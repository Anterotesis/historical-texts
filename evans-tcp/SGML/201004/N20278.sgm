<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IF</HI> the prophetic parts of the oracles of God, form what may be &s;tiled "a &s;acred Calen|dar;" or, "an Almanac of Prophecy," it is with the greate&s;t propriety, that the Watchmen of Zion are di&s;po&s;ed, now and then, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ult this &s;acred calendar, in view of determining the watch of the night, and, of con&s;equence, how long before the arrival of the long-wi&s;hed-for promi&s;ed day. From premi&s;es which the &s;acred &s;criptures afford, calculations may, with a good degree of preci&s;ion, be made, re&s;pecting the time of the accompli&s;hment of the prophecies which relate to the future pro&s;perity of the Zion of God. The redemption of the church of God from the bondage of Papal Babylon, as well as from the general dominion of the Powers of Darkne&s;s, is a glorious and animating &s;ubject of prophecy. The Lord hath &s;poken, and the decree &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll be fulfilled.&mdash;If, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ancient time, the people of God believed what the Lord had &s;poken re&s;pecting the redemption of his people; if, from the &s;acred calendar, they di&s;covered the time of the promi&s;ed redemption&mdash;prayed for, and actually &s;aw the fulfilment of the ob|ject of their hopes, in temporal and in &s;piritu|al deliverances; what forbids that, in this day
<PB N="iv" REF="026594_0004_0FD0B257CF23FDE8">of general captivity, the prophets of the Lord &s;hould look with the &s;ame faith and prayer for the fulfilment of tho&s;e promi&s;es which re&s;pect the &s;piritual deliverance of the Chri&s;tian Church, both from the bondage of Babylon, and from the thraldom of Satan?&mdash;And more e&s;pecially, as we evidently &s;ee marks of the divine progre&s;s in this work, in his pre&s;ent judgments among the nations of the earth, and particularly on my&s;tical Babylon; which all allow, are but a little to precede the glorious redemption and pro&s;perity of the Church in the Millennial-day.&mdash;"<HI>One circum&s;tance,</HI> &s;aith Dr. Hallifax,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hallifax's Sermon, preached at Bi&s;hop Warburton's Lecture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, London <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 96, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">hed 1776.</NOTE> <HI>ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed&mdash;namely, the menaces of certain vengeance to be hereafter inflicted on the enemies of the true religion, intimated by the de&s;truction of the body of the fourth bea&s;t; and</HI> &s;ub&s;equent to that <HI>the promi&s;e of the univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the reign of Chri&s;t, when</HI> the &s;tone cut out of the mountain without hands, <HI>&s;hall &s;trike and</HI> break to pieces the image on its &s;ect; <HI>and become a</HI> great mountain, and fill the whole earth. <HI>This part of the prophecies is yet unfulfilled; nor is it for us to a&s;certain
<PB N="v" REF="026594_0005_0FD0B258E9284528">the manner in which &s;o important a revolu|tion, in the religious world, will be effected: The u&s;e intended by the ob&s;ervation here is, from the &s;ymptoms of decline which are now di&s;cernible in the &s;y&s;tem of the Papal pow|er, to point out to you the pre&s;umption that a|ri&s;es in favor of the truth of the prophetical de|nunciations, and from the concu&s;&s;ions which have already &s;hook the tottering throne of &s;uper&s;tition, to learn to expect, in God's good time,</HI> its full and final demolition."</P>
<P>And if this celebrated Author, in his day, thought there was ground to u&s;e the following language, in view of prophecies already ful|filled, and events then exi&s;ting, with how much nore rea&s;on may we confidently adopt it now, and &s;ay, that, <HI>"under the au&s;pices of &s;uch a guide we may hope to advance, &s;ecurely, in our projected work; and to have the plea|&s;ure of tho&s;e, who, after long travelling in a dreary night, perceive, at la&s;t, the darkne&s;s to dimini&s;h, and the reddening &s;treaks of the morning, betokening to them, that the day is at hand?"&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>The object in publi&s;hing Dr. Bellamy's di&s;|cour&s;e is to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of the Millen|nium as to matter of fact: and by publi&s;hing Pre&s;ident Edwards<HI>'s "Humble Attempt to
<PB N="vi" REF="026594_0006_0FD0B25A9158CFA8">promote explicit Agreement and vi&s;ible U|nion in Prayer;"</HI> it is hoped attention will be excited to the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which God hath ordained to be u&s;ed in view of a gracious fulfilment of <HI>every</HI> promi&s;e made to his Church and to his People. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</HI></P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the third and la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e is to &s;upport the objects of the two former, by an appeal to exi&s;ting facts, to the demon&s;tration of pre&s;ent events. By the&s;e it appears, that what Dr. Hallifax termed <HI>"the reddening &s;treaks of the morning,"</HI> have become entitled to the &s;tile of the <HI>dawn,</HI> if not to the <HI>morning</HI> of the day.&mdash;How does our faith grow&mdash;our confidence increa&s;e, and our joyful hearts ex|ult at the &s;ight, or rather at the &s;ound of the &s;tately &s;teppings of our God in the pre&s;ent re|volutions of his providence, fulfilling the pur|po&s;es of his great decree!&mdash;From what we ob|&s;erve to have, already, taken place, may we not confidently anticipate all that is to come?&mdash;<HI>The te&s;timony of Je&s;us,</HI> &s;aith the angel to St. John, <HI>is a &s;pirit of prophecy.</HI>&mdash;If, in a &s;pirit of pro|phecy, the Great Head of the Church hath &s;po|ken of things to come, to &s;trengthen the faith, and to cheer the hope of his followers, it can|not
<PB N="vii" REF="026594_0007_0FD0B25C89DD3908">be denied, but our time and talents are well employed, whil&s;t, in &s;tudy, with meekne&s;s and prayer, we labor to under&s;tand and to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the ble&s;&s;ings he hath &s;o graciou&s;ly prepared, and &s;o abundantly promi&s;ed to his Church.</P>
<P>If, in the day in which Pre&s;ident Edwards lived, it was thought time for the Zion of God to go into labor, in view of the approach of the time of promi&s;ed redemption to I&s;rael, with how much more courage and confidence may the Church of God now proceed in the ardu|ous, yet noble and intere&s;ting work?</P>
<P>The arguments which his invaluable tract &s;ugge&s;ts for explicit Agreement and vi&s;ible U|nion of God's People in extraordinary Prayer, for the Revival of Religion, and the Advance|ment of Chri&s;t's Kingdom on Earth, pur&s;uant to Scripture-promi&s;es and Prophecies, concern|ing the <HI>LAST TIME,</HI> are as applicable to the &s;tate of the Church, and of the world, now, as they were then, and the encouragement, from pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, much more animating.</P>
<P>If any individual Chri&s;tian, any &s;ociety of Chri&s;tian People, or any Mini&s;ter, or a&s;&s;ocia|tion of Mini&s;ters, &s;hould be &s;o far impre&s;&s;ed with the propriety of a pre&s;ent compliance with what Pre&s;ident Edwards labored to bring about in his day, as to de&s;ire that mea&s;ures &s;hould
<PB N="viii" REF="026594_0008_0FD0B25E2F2D5CB0">be taken for the accompli&s;hment of the object of his work, and expre&s;s a willingne&s;s to aid in laying a foundation for a general and united exertion in prayer throughout all the Chri&s;tian Churches in our land; the Editor pledges his whole heart in aid to any &s;uch propo&s;al, and would think him&s;elf highly favored by any com|munications, from any quarter, on the &s;ublime and animating &s;ubject.</P>
<P>That the Great Head of the Church would graciou&s;ly take this humble attempt to the ho|nor of his name, and for the intere&s;ts of his Zion, under his holy protection, and pro&s;per, and do his own ble&s;&s;ed will in all things which it &s;trives to accompli&s;h, is the fervent prayer of one, who knows no higher object of pre&s;ent or future ambition, than to approve him&s;elf, and to be approved of his Lord and Ma&s;ter, as an indu&s;trious h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wer of wood, and drawer of wa|ter for the church of God.</P>

<P>And I &s;aw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old &s;erpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thou&s;and years.

<P>IN a great variety of re&s;pects the Bible is the mo&s;t remarkable book in the world. In it we have God's moral character clearly ex|hibited to view, by a hi&s;tory of his conduct, as moral governor of the world, from the be|ginning; and the nature of fallen man paint|ed to the life, by a hi&s;tory of their behavi|our for four thou&s;and years. In it we have opened the glorious and a&s;toni&s;hing method that has been entered upon to di&s;appoint all
<PB N="10" REF="026594_0014_0FD0B2676D9FBBB8">Satan's de&s;igns, by the interpo&s;ition of the Son of God; and are informed of his birth, life, death, re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion and exalt|ation, and of the glorious de&s;igns he has in view. And the whole is &s;o contrived as to be admirably &s;uited to all the circum&s;tances and needs of a good man, that, as it was de|&s;igned to be the good man's book, in a pe|culiar &s;en&s;e, &s;o it is perfectly &s;uited to his ca&s;e. <HI>It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man of God may be perfect, thorough|ly furni&s;hed to all good works.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;incere concern for the cau&s;e of truth and virtue, for the honor of God and inte|re&s;t of true religion, which is peculiar to a good man, who&s;e character it is to love Chri&s;t above father and mother, wife and children, hou&s;es and lands, yea, better than his own life, mu&s;t naturally &s;ubject him to a peculiar kind of &s;olicitude; even as a child, of a truly filial &s;pirit, is pained when it goes ill with his father's family, to who&s;e intere&s;t he is clo&s;ely attached, and has a whole &s;y&s;|tem of inward &s;en&s;ations that a &s;tranger in|termeddles not with.

God knew before-hand the angui&s;h which would be apt to fill their hearts, the &s;inking di&s;cour|agements, and all the train of dark and gloo|my thoughts they would be incident to, and before-hand provided a remedy.

And what has happened may help us to realize a little what mu&s;t have been the &s;tate of a fallen world, if grace had never interpo&s;ed.

<P>We are apt to wonder why the&s;e glorious days &s;hould be &s;o long delayed, if God, in|deed, intends &s;uch mercy to men; but God, infinitely wi&s;e, knows what is be&s;t&mdash;knows how to conduct the affairs of the univer&s;e&mdash; knows when is the fitte&s;t time to introduce this glorious &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of things&mdash;knows when

<P><HI>IF</HI> any enquire why the en&s;uing work is republi&s;hed, I would beg leave to lay be|fore them the following intelligence:</P>
<P>At an a&s;&s;ociation of the mini&s;ters and me&s;|&s;engers of the Bapti&s;t churches in the counties of Northampton, Leice&s;ter, &amp;c. held at Not|tingham, in the year <HI>1784,</HI> a re&s;olution was formed to e&s;tabli&s;h, through the a&s;&s;ociation, <HI>a meeting of prayer for the GENERAL revival and &s;pread of religion.</HI> This was to be ob|&s;erved the fir&s;t Monday evening in every ca|lendar month, by all the churches. It &s;till continues.&mdash;In <HI>1786,</HI> another Bapti&s;t a&s;&s;ocia|tion, commonly called the <HI>Midland,</HI> held that year at Aulce&s;ter, in the county of Warwick, entered into the &s;ame re&s;olution. Many other churches, particularly in York&s;hire, have a|dopted, and now follow the above practice.&mdash;
<PB N="liv" REF="026594_0056_0FD0B2A4F36C1000">We have the plea&s;ure al&s;o to find, that &s;everal <HI>Paedo-Bapti&s;t</HI> churches &s;tatedly meet on tho&s;e evenings, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The re-publication of the following work, is with the avowed de&s;ign of promoting the above agreement and practice. Tho&s;e concerned in its fir&s;t in&s;titution, never intended it &s;hould be confined to any peculiar connection, or parti|cular denomination. Rather they ardently wi&s;hed it might become general among the real friends of truth and holine&s;s. The advocates of error are indefatigable in their endeavours to overthrow the di&s;tingui&s;hing and intere&s;ting doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; tho&s;e doctrines which are the grounds of our hope, and &s;ources of our joy. Surely it becomes the followers of Chri&s;t, to u&s;e every effort, in order to &s;trength|en the things which remain.</P>
<P>By re-publi&s;hing the following work, I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf as becoming an&s;werable for every &s;entiment it contains. An author and an editor are very di&s;tinct characters. Should any entertain different views re&s;pecting &s;ome of the prophecies in the in&s;pired page, from tho&s;e that are here advanced, yet &s;uch may, and I hope will, approve of the general de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tale, we may rea|&s;onably expect a diver&s;ity of &s;entiments upon religious matters. Each ought to think for
<PB N="lv" REF="026594_0057_0FD0B2A6277D3120">him&s;elf; and every one has a right, on proper occa&s;ions, to &s;hew his opinion. Yet all &s;hould remember, that there are but two parties in the world, each engaged in oppo&s;ite cau&s;es; the cau&s;e of God and of Satan; of holine&s;s and of &s;in; of heaven and hell. The advance|ment of the one, and the down fall of the other, mu&s;t appear exceedingly de&s;irable to every real friend of God and man. If &s;uch, in &s;ome re|&s;pects entertain different &s;entiments, and prac|ti&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing modes of wor&s;hip, &s;urely they may unite in the above bu&s;ine&s;s. O for thou&s;ands upon thou&s;ands, divided into &s;mall bands in their re&s;pective cities, towns, villa|ges and neighbourhood, all met at the &s;ame time, and in pur&s;uit of one end, offering up their united prayers, like &s;o many a&s;cending clouds of incen&s;e before the Mo&s;t High! May he &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings on all the &s;cattered tribes of Zion! Grace, great grace be with all them that love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;inceri|ty! <HI>AMEN!</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE ruin of Satan's mi&s;erable kingdom, and the advancement of the univer&s;al and happy reign of Chri&s;t on the earth, were included and hinted in the &s;entence denoun|ced on the &s;erpent, that the <HI>&s;eed of the wo|man &s;hould brui&s;e his head.</HI> What was a terrible threatening to Satan, in the &s;urprized ears of our fir&s;t guilty parents, implied a joy|ful prophecy, to keep them from de&s;pair, and enliven their hopes for them&s;elves and their de&s;cendants, of obtaining by this &s;eed of her's an eternal triumph over him who had &s;o &s;ad|ly foiled them. And it is likely, their hopes and faith immediately aro&s;e, laid hold on the reviving prophecy, earne&s;tly de&s;ired its hap|py accompli&s;hment, and tran&s;mitted it to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But though this prophecy was at fir&s;t only delivered in the form of a threatening to Sa|tan; it was afterwards directly given in the form of a promi&s;e to Abraham, though &s;till in general terms, that <HI>in his &s;eed &s;hould all
<PB N="lviii" REF="026594_0059_0FD0B2AA46E18150">the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Yet this general promi&s;e was more clearly by de|grees explained in the following ages, to mean a Divine King, no other than the Son of God a&s;&s;uming human nature of the &s;eed of Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob and David; that &s;hould be born of a virgin in Bethlehem of Judah; and at fir&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed, abu&s;ed, rejected, and put to death; but &s;hould ri&s;e to im|mortal life, a&s;cend to heaven, and thence extend his ble&s;&s;ed kingdom over all nations; not by outward force, but inward overcom|ing influence, by his word and &s;pirit, mak|ing them <HI>his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">illing people in the day of his power;</HI> and reigning in glorious light and holine&s;s, and love and peace for ever; and the advancement of this univer&s;al and hap|py reign has been the earne&s;t de&s;ire and prayer of the &s;aints in all ages to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>But how great the honour and how lively the encouragement given in &s;cripture to tho&s;e their prayers; by repre&s;enting them as of|fered by Chri&s;t him&s;elf with the fragrant in|cen&s;e of his own merits and interce&s;&s;ion, on the <HI>golden altar before the throne,</HI> and a&s;cend|ing together in one grateful perfume to God! And how cheering to every &s;aint is that pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="lix" REF="026594_0060_0FD0B2AB2C0A9110">of his&mdash;<HI>From the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, even to the going down of the &s;ame, my name &s;hall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incen&s;e &s;hall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering!</HI> How plea&s;ing to God and the heavenly ho&s;ts to &s;ee, as the &s;un goes round the globe, this grateful incen&s;e ri&s;ing from every part on high! and the more ex|ten&s;ive and ince&s;&s;ant are the&s;e prayers, a&s;|cending from the circle of the earth, the more does this ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;e go into its de&s;ired fulfilment, and the holy God is more plea&s;ed and glorified.</P>
<P>To promote the increa&s;e, concurrency, and con&s;tancy of the&s;e acceptable prayers, is the great intention both of the pious me|morial of our reverend and dear brethren in Scotland, and of the worthy author of this exciting e&s;&s;ay. And this de&s;ign we cannot but recommend to all who de&s;ire the coming of this bli&s;sful kingdom in its pro|mi&s;ed extent and glory, in this wretched world.</P>
<P>As to the author's ingenious ob&s;ervations on the prophecies, we entirely leave them to the reader's judgment: with only ob&s;erv|ing, though it is the apprehen&s;ion of many learned men, that there is to be a very ge|neral
<PB N="lx" REF="026594_0061_0FD0B2AC2AB5B358">&s;laughter of the witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t about the time of their fini&s;hing their te&s;ti|mony to the pure wor&s;hip and truths of the go&s;pel, about three or four years before the &s;eventh angel &s;ounds his trumpet for the ru|in of Antichri&s;t;&mdash;yet we cannot &s;ee that this is any ju&s;t objection again&s;t our joint and earne&s;t prayers for the glorious age &s;uc|ceeding, or for the ha&s;tening of it.</P>
<P>For if &s;uch a terrible time is coming in Europe, which we in depending America are likely to &s;hare in; the more need we have of joining in earne&s;t and con&s;tant prayers for extraordinary &s;uffering graces for our&s;elves and others. And that &s;uch a time is coming on the members of Chri&s;t, is no more an objection again&s;t their prayers for the ha&s;tening of the following glory, than it was before the incarnation of him their head, that his mo&s;t bitter &s;ufferings were to precede the &s;preading of this joyous kingdom among the nations. And the nearer the day approaches, the more need we have to be awakened to continual watch|fulne&s;s and prayer.</P>
<P>May God pour out on all his people a|bundantly, the &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplica|tion, and prepare them for the amazing
<PB N="lxi" REF="026594_0062_0FD0B2AE473346E8">changes ha&s;tening on the earth, both for previous trials and for following glories!</P>

<P>IN this chapter we have a prophecy of a fu|ture glorious advancement of the church of God; wherein it is evident, &s;omething further is intended than ever was fulfilled to the nation of the Jews under the Old Te&s;|tament. For here are plain prophecies of &s;uch things as never were fulfilled before the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly what is &s;aid in the two la&s;t ver&s;es in the chapter, of <HI>many people and &s;trong nations wor&s;hip|ping and &s;eeking the true God,</HI> and of &s;o great an acce&s;&s;ion of Gentile nations to the church of God, that by far the greater part of the vi&s;ible wor&s;hippers of God &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of this new acce&s;&s;ion, &s;o that they &s;hould be to the other as <HI>ten to one</HI>&mdash;a certain number
<PB N="64" REF="026594_0065_0FD0B2B32A7A8AD0">for an uncertain. There never happened any thing, from the time of the prophet Ze|chariah to the coming of Chri&s;t, to an&s;wer this prophecy; and it can have no fulfilment but either in the calling of the Gentiles, in and after the days of the apo&s;tles, or in the future glorious enlargement of the church of God in the latter ages of the world, &s;o often foretold by the prophets of the Old Te&s;tament, and by the prophet Zechariah in particular, in the latter part of his pro|phecy. It is mo&s;t probable, that what the &s;pirit of God has chief re&s;pect to, is that la&s;t and greate&s;t enlargement and mo&s;t glorious advancement of the church of God on earth, in the benefits of which e&s;pecially the Jewi&s;h nation were to have a &s;hare, and a very e|minent and di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;hare. There is a great agreement between what is here &s;aid and other prophecies, that mu&s;t manife&s;tly have re&s;pect to the church's latter-day-glory; as that in I&s;aiah lx. 2, 3, 4. <HI>The Lord &s;hall ari&s;e upon thee, and his glory &s;hall be &s;een up|on thee; and the Gentiles &s;hall come to thy light, and kings to the brightne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing.

And he &s;hall judge among many people, and rebuke &s;trong nations afar off; and they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow|&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks; nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more.</HI>&mdash;See al&s;o, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> ii. at the beginning. There has been nothing yet brought to pa&s;s in any mea|&s;ure to an&s;wer the&s;e prophecies. And as the prophecy in my text and the following ver&s;e does agree with them, &s;o there is rea|&s;on
<PB N="66" REF="026594_0067_0FD0B2B6A7A450C0">to think it has a re&s;pect to the &s;ame times. And indeed there is a remarkable a|greement in the de&s;cription given through|out the chapter, with the repre&s;entations made of tho&s;e times el&s;ewhere in the pro|phets, as may be &s;een by comparing ver. 3. with <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lx. 14.&mdash;ver. 4. with <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lxv. 20, 22. and xxxiii. 24.&mdash;ver. 6, 7, 8. with <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvii. 2, 11, 12, 21.&mdash;ver. 7. with <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xliii. 5, 6. and xlix. 12. and lix. 19. &mdash;ver. 12, 13. with <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> ii. 21, 22. and <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiv. 22&mdash;29.&mdash;ver. 8, 12, 13. with <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 28&mdash;30.&mdash;ver. 13. with <HI>Zeph.</HI> iii. 20. and <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xix. 24.&mdash;ver. 19. with <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lxi. 3. and <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxi. 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>So that however the prophet, in &s;ome things that are &s;aid in this chapter, may have re&s;pect to future &s;miles of heaven on the na|tion of the Jews, lately returned from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and re&s;ettled in the land of Canaan, in a great increa&s;e of their numbers and wealth, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> return of more captives from Chaldea and other countries, &amp;c. yet the &s;pirit of God has doubtle&s;s re|&s;pect to things far greater than the&s;e, and of which the&s;e were but &s;aint re&s;emblances.&mdash; We find it common in the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament, that when the prophets are

<P>And whereas the prophet, in this chap|ter, &s;peaks of God's <HI>bringing his people a|gain from the ea&s;t and we&s;t to Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (ver. 7, 8.) <HI>And multitudes of all nations taking hold of the &s;kirts of the Jews;</HI> &s;o far as we may &s;uppo&s;e that this means literally that nation of the po&s;terity of Jacob, it can|not have chief re&s;pect to any return of the Jews from Babylon and other countries in tho&s;e ancient times before Chri&s;t, for no &s;uch things as are here &s;poken of, attended any &s;uch return; but it mu&s;t have re&s;pect to the great calling and gathering of the Jews in|to the fold of Chri&s;t, and their being receiv|ed to the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom, after the fall of Antichri&s;t, or the de&s;truction of my&s;|tical Babylon.</P>

In the text we have an account how this future glorious advancement of the church of God &s;hould be brought on, or introduc|ed, viz. By great multitudes in different towns and countries taking up a joint re&s;olution, and coming into an expre&s;s and vi&s;ible a|greement, that they will, by united and ex|traordinary prayer, &s;eek to God that he would come and manife&s;t him&s;elf, and grant the tokens and fruits of his gracious pre|&s;ence.&mdash;Particularly we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The duty with the attendance on which the glorious event foretold &s;hall be brought on, viz. The duty of prayer.&mdash;Prayer, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, is here to be taken &s;ynechdochical|ly, for the whole of the wor&s;hip of God&mdash; prayer being a principal part of the wor&s;hip of the church of God in the days of the go&s;|pel, when &s;acrifices are aboli&s;hed; and &s;o, that this is to be under&s;tood only as a pro|phecy of a great revival of religion, and of the true wor&s;hip of God among his vi&s;ible people, the acce&s;&s;ion of others to the church, and turning of multitudes from idolatry to the wor&s;hip of the true God. But it appears to me rea&s;onable, to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;omething more &s;pecial is intended, with regard to the duty of prayer; con&s;idering that prayer is
<PB N="69" REF="026594_0070_0FD0B2B9E007A948">here expre&s;sly and repeatedly mentioned; and al&s;o con&s;idering how parallel this place is with many other prophecies, that &s;peak of an extraordinary &s;pirit of prayer, as pre|ceding and introducing that glorious day of revival of religion, and advancement of the church's peace and pro&s;perity, &s;o often fore|told, (which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to men|tion hereafter) and particularly the agree|ablene&s;s of what is here &s;aid, with what is &s;aid afterwards by the &s;ame prophet, of the <HI>pouring out of a &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplica|tions,</HI> as that with which this great revival of religion &s;hall begin, chap. xii. 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. The good, that &s;hall be &s;ought by prayer; which is God him&s;elf.&mdash;It is &s;aid once and again, <HI>They &s;hall go to pray before the Lord, and to &s;eek the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> This is the good they a&s;k for and &s;eek by prayer, <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI> him&s;elf.&mdash;To &s;eek God, as the expre&s;&s;ion may, perhaps, be &s;ometimes u&s;ed in &s;cripture, may &s;ignify no more than &s;eeking the favour or mercy of God. And if it be taken &s;o here, <HI>praying before the Lord,</HI> and <HI>&s;eeking the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> mu&s;t be look|ed upon as &s;ynonymous expre&s;&s;ions.

<PB N="70" REF="026594_0071_0FD0B2BB2B147910">by various expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame import, for the greater empha&s;is.&mdash;But cer|tainly that expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;eeking the Lord,</HI> is very commonly u&s;ed to &s;ignify &s;omething more than merely, in general, to &s;eek &s;ome mercy of God: It implies that God him&s;elf is the great good de&s;ired and &s;ought after; that the ble&s;&s;ings pur&s;ued are God's gracious pre&s;ence, the ble&s;&s;ed manife&s;tations of him, union and intercour&s;e with him; or, in &s;hort, God's manife&s;tations and communications of him&s;elf by his Holy Spirit. Thus the p&s;almi&s;t de&s;ired God, thir&s;ted after him, and &s;ought him. <HI>O God, thou art my God; ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly will I &s;eek thee.

<P>And it &s;eems rea&s;onable to under&s;tand the phra&s;e, <HI>&s;eeking the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e here, and not as merely &s;ignifying the &s;ame thing with praying to God; not only becau&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion is repeatedly added to praying before the Lord, in the text, as &s;ignifying &s;omething more; but al&s;o becau&s;e the phra&s;e, taken in this &s;en&s;e, is exactly a|greeable to other parallel prophetic repre|&s;entations. Thus God's people's &s;eeking, by earne&s;t prayer, the promi&s;ed re&s;toration of the church of God, after the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and the great apo&s;tacy that occa|&s;ioned it. is called their <HI>&s;eeking God, and &s;earching for him;</HI> and God's granting this promi&s;ed revival and re&s;toration is called his being <HI>found of them.

From the repre&s;entation made in the pro|phecy, it appears rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that it will be fulfilled &s;omething after this man|ner &mdash;Fir&s;t, that there &s;hall be given much of a &s;pirit of prayer to God's people, in many places, di&s;po&s;ing them to come into an ex|pre&s;s agreement, unitedly to pray to God in an extraordinary manner, that he would ap|pear for the help of his church, and in mer|cy to mankind, and pour out his Spirit, re|vive his work, and advance his &s;piritual kingdom in the world, as he has promi&s;ed; and that this di&s;po&s;ition to &s;uch prayer, and union in it, will gradually &s;pread more and more, and increa&s;e to greater degrees; with which at length will gradually be introdu|ced a revival of religion, and a di&s;po&s;ition to greater engagedne&s;s in the wor&s;hip and &s;er|vice

It &s;eems to me much more natural, to under|&s;tand the&s;e latter words as importing the con&s;ent of tho&s;e to whom the propo&s;al is made, or the reply of one and another that falls in it. This is much more agreeable to the plain de&s;ign of the text, which is to re|pre&s;ent the concurrence of great numbers in this affair, and more agreeable to the repre|&s;entation made in the next ver&s;e, of one fol|lowing another, many taking hold of the &s;kirt of him that is a Jew. And though if the words are thus under&s;tood, we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e an ellip&s;is in the text, &s;omething un|der&s;tood that is not expre&s;&s;ed, as if it had been &s;aid&mdash;Tho&s;e of other cities &s;hall &s;ay&mdash; I will go al&s;o;&mdash;yet this is not difficult to be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;uch ellip&s;is are very common in &s;cripture.

<P N="5">5. We may ob&s;erve the manner of prayer agreed on, or the manner in which they agree, to engage in and perform the duty. Let us go &s;peedily to pray; or as it in the margin, let us go continually. The words literally tran&s;lated are, <HI>let us go in going.</HI> Such an ingemination or doubling of words, is very common in the Hebrew language, when it is intended that a thing &s;hall be very &s;trong|ly expre&s;&s;ed; it generally implies the &s;uper|lative degree of a thing; as the holy of ho|lies &s;ignifies the mo&s;t holy; but it common|ly denotes, not only the utmo&s;t degree of a thing, but al&s;o the utmo&s;t certainty; as when God &s;aid to <HI>Abraham, in multiplying, I will multiply thy &s;eed.</HI> It implies both that God would certainly multiply his &s;eed, and al&s;o multiply it exceedingly. So when God &s;aid to <HI>Adam, in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, in
<PB N="79" REF="026594_0080_0FD0B2C8A7D58A50">dying thou &s;halt die</HI> (as the words are in the original) it implies, both that he &s;hould &s;urely die, and al&s;o that he &s;hould die mo&s;t terribly, &s;hould utterly peri&s;h, and be de&s;troyed to the utmo&s;t degree. Yea, &s;ometimes it &s;eems to imply &s;omething el&s;e &s;till; and, in &s;hort, as this ingemination of words in the He|brew, in general, denotes the &s;trength of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;o it is u&s;ed to &s;ignify almo&s;t all tho&s;e things that are wont to be &s;ignified by the various forms of &s;trong &s;peech in other lan|guages: &s;ometimes it &s;ignifies the utmo&s;t degree of a thing; &s;ometimes certainty; &s;ometimes peremptorine&s;s and terriblene&s;s of a threatening, or the greatne&s;s and po&s;i|tivene&s;s of a promi&s;e, the &s;trictne&s;s of a com|mand, and the earne&s;tne&s;s of a reque&s;t.&mdash; When God &s;ays to <HI>Adam, dying thou &s;halt die,</HI> it is equivalent to &s;uch &s;trong expre&s;&s;i|ons in Engli&s;h, as, thou &s;halt die indeed, or, thou &s;halt die with a witne&s;s. So when it is &s;aid in the text, <HI>let us go in going, and pray before the Lord,</HI> the &s;trength of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion repre&s;ents the earne&s;tne&s;s of tho&s;e that make the propo&s;al, their great engaged|ne&s;s in the affair; and with re&s;pect to the duty propo&s;ed, it may be under&s;tood to &s;ig|nify that they &s;hould be &s;peedy, fervent, and
<PB N="80" REF="026594_0081_0FD0B2CA2826A7F0">con&s;tant in it; or, in one ward, that it &s;hould be thoroughly performed.</P>
<P N="6">6. We may learn from the tenor of this prophecy, together with the context, that this union in &s;uch prayer is foretold as a be|coming and happy thing, and that which would be acceptable to God, and attended with glorious &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From the whole we may infer, that it is a very &s;uitable thing, and well plea&s;ing to God, for many people, in different parts of the world, by expre&s;s agreement, to come into a vi&s;ible union, in extraordinary, &s;pee|dy fervent, and con&s;tant prayer, for tho&s;e great effu&s;ions of the Holy Spirit, which &s;hall bring on that advancement of Chri&s;t's church and kingdom, that God has &s;o often promi&s;ed &s;hall be in the latter ages of the world.</P>
<P>And &s;o from hence I would infer the duty of God's people, with regard to the memo|rial lately &s;ent over into America, from Scot|land, by a number of mini&s;ters there, pro|po&s;ing a method for &s;uch an union as has been &s;poken of, in extraordinary prayer for this great mercy.</P>
<P>And it being the &s;pecial de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e, to per&s;uade &s;uch as are friends to
<PB N="81" REF="026594_0082_0FD0B2CBA675E2E0">the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t's kingdom, to a com|pliance with the propo&s;al and reque&s;t made in that memorial, I &s;hall fir&s;t give a &s;hort hi&s;torical account of the affair it relates to, from letters, papers, and pamphlets, that have come over from Scotland; to which I &s;hall annex the memorial it&s;elf; and then I &s;hall offer &s;ome arguments and motives; tending to induce the friends of religion to fall in with what is propo&s;ed; and la&s;tly, make an&s;wer to &s;ome objections that may po&s;&s;ibly be made again&s;t it.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e things, viz. an hi&s;|torical account of the concert, which the memorial relates to, the following ob&s;erva|tions may give a &s;ufficient view of that af|fair.</P>
<P>In October. A. D. 1744, a number of mi|ni&s;ters in Scotland, taking into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of God's church, and of the world of mankind, judged that the providence of God, at &s;uch a day, did loudly call &s;uch as were concerned for the welfare of Zion, to united extraordinary applications to the God of all grace, &s;uitably acknowledging Him as the fountain of all the &s;piritual be|nefits and ble&s;&s;ings of his church, and ear|ne&s;tly
<PB N="82" REF="026594_0083_0FD0B2CE10BE54C8">praying to him, that he would appear in his glory, and favour Zion, and manife&s;t his compa&s;&s;ion to the world of mankind, by an abundant effu&s;ion of his Holy Spirit on all the churches, and the whole habitable earth, to revive true religion in all parts of Chri&s;tendom, and to deliver all nations from their great and manifold &s;piritual calamities and mi&s;eries, and ble&s;s them with the un|&s;peakable benefits of the kingdom of our glorious Redeemer, and fill the whole earth with his glory. And con&s;ulting one another on the &s;ubject, they looked on them&s;elves, for their own part, obliged to engage in this duty; and, as far as in them lay, to per&s;uade others to the &s;ame; and to endeavour to find out, and fix on &s;ome method, that &s;hould mo&s;t effectually tend to promote, and up|hold &s;uch extraordinary application to heav|en among God's people. And after &s;eek|ing to God by prayer for direction, they de|termined on the following method, as what they would conform to in their own prac|tice, and propo&s;e to be practi&s;ed by others, for the two years next following, viz. To &s;et apart &s;ome time on Saturday evening, and Sabbath morning, every week, for the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid, as other duties would al|low
<PB N="83" REF="026594_0084_0FD0B2CE18B3B718">to every one re&s;pectively; and more &s;o|lemnly, the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of each quarter, (beginning with the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of Novem|ber, then next en&s;uing) either the whole day, or part of the day, as per&s;ons find them|&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed, or think their circum&s;tances will allow; the time to be &s;pent either in private praying &s;ocieties, or in public meet|ings, or alone in &s;ecret, as &s;hall be found mo&s;t practicable, or judged mo&s;t conveni|ent, by &s;uch as are willing, in &s;ome way or other, to join in this affair; but not that any &s;hould make any promi&s;es, or be looked up|on as under &s;trict bonds in any re&s;pect, con|&s;tantly and without fail to ob&s;erve every one of the&s;e days, whatever their circum&s;tances &s;hould be, or however other duties and ne|ce&s;&s;ary affairs might interfere; or that per|&s;ons &s;hould look upon them&s;elves bound with regard to the&s;e days in any wi&s;e as tho' the time were holy, or the &s;etting them a part for religious purpo&s;es were e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;acred authority; but yet, as a proper guard again&s;t negligence and un&s;teadine&s;s, and a prudent pre&s;ervative, from yielding to a di&s;po&s;ition, which per&s;ons might be li|able to, through the prevalence of indolence
<PB N="84" REF="026594_0085_0FD0B2D05DFAE188">and li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, to excu&s;e them&s;elves on trivial occa&s;ions, it was propo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who unite in this affair &s;hould re&s;olve with them|&s;elves, that if, by urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, or other|wi&s;e, they are hindered from joining with others, on the very day agreed on, yet they would not wholly neglect bearing their part in the duty propo&s;ed, but would take the fir&s;t convenient day following, for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why Saturday evening and Lord's-day morning were judged mo&s;t con|venient for the weekly &s;ea&s;ons, was, that the&s;e times being &s;o near the time of di&s;|pen&s;ing go&s;pel ordinances through the Chri&s;|tian world, which are the great means, in the u&s;e of which God is wont to grant his Spirit to mankind, and the principal means that the Spirit of God makes u&s;e of to carry on his work of grace, it may be well &s;uppo&s;|ed, that the minds of Chri&s;tians, in general, will, at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, be e&s;pecially di&s;engag|ed from &s;ecular affairs, and di&s;po&s;ed to pious meditations and the duties of devotion, and more naturally led to &s;eek communications of the Holy Spirit, and &s;ucce&s;s of the means of grace. And as to the quarterly times, it was thought helpful to memory, that they
<PB N="85" REF="026594_0086_0FD0B2D146DF0498">&s;hould be on one or other of the fir&s;t days of each quarter; Tue&s;day was preferred to Monday, becau&s;e in &s;ome places people might have public prayers and &s;ermon on the &s;tated day, which might not be &s;o con|venient on Monday, as on &s;ome day at a greater di&s;tance from the Sabbath.</P>
<P>It was reckoned a chief u&s;e of &s;uch an a|greement and method as this, that it would be a good expedient for the maintaining and keeping up, among&s;t the people of God, that great Chri&s;tian duty of prayerfulne&s;s for the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, in general, which Chri&s;t has directed his followers to be &s;o much in, that it may not be out of mind, and in a great mea&s;ure &s;unk. Things, that we are too little inclined to, through &s;loth, carnali|ty, or a fulne&s;s of our own worldly and private concerns, and that are to be attend|ed at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons or other, but have no &s;pe|cial &s;ea&s;ons &s;tated for them, are apt to be forgotten, or put off from time to time, and, as it were, adjourned without day; and &s;o, if not wholly neglected, yet too little attend|ed. But when we fix certain &s;ea&s;ons, which we re&s;olve, unle&s;s extraordinarily hindered, to devote to the duty, it tends to prevent
<PB N="86" REF="026594_0087_0FD0B310AE38EA90">forgetfulne&s;s, and a &s;ettled negligence of it. The certain returns of the &s;ea&s;on will natur|ally refre&s;h the memory, will tend to put us in mind of the precept of Chri&s;t, and the ob|ligations that lie on all his followers, to a|bound in &s;uch a duty, and renewedly en|gage us to the con&s;ideration of the import|ance, nece&s;&s;ity and un&s;peakable value of the mercy &s;ought; and &s;o, by frequent renova|tion, to keep alive the con&s;ideration, and &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things at all times. Thus the fir&s;t promoters of this agreement judged that it would be &s;ub&s;ervient to more abundant prayerfulne&s;s for effu&s;ions of the Holy Spir|it at all times through the year, both in &s;e|cret and &s;ocial wor&s;hip; particularly as to this la&s;t, in congregations, families, and o|ther praying &s;ocieties. And then they al&s;o judged, that &s;uch an agreed union would tend to animate and encourage God's peo|ple in the duty propo&s;ed; and that particu|lar per&s;ons and &s;ocieties, knowing that great multitudes of their fellow-Chri&s;tians, in &s;o many di&s;tant places, were, at the &s;ame time, (as a token of the union of their hearts with them in this affair) by agreement, engaged in the &s;ame holy exerci&s;e, would naturally be enlivened in the duty by &s;uch a con&s;ider|ation.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="026594_0088_0FD07FD599A29770">
It was not thought be&s;t to propo&s;e at fir&s;t a longer time for the continuance of this pre|ci&s;e method than two years; it being con&s;i|dered, that it is not po&s;&s;ible, before any trial, &s;o well to judge of the expedience of a par|ticular method and certain circum&s;tances of the managing and ordering &s;uch an affair, as after &s;ome time of experience. And it was not known, but that, after long con&s;i|deration, and &s;ome trial, it might be thought be&s;t to alter &s;ome circum&s;tance; or whether others that had not yet been con&s;ulted, might not propo&s;e a better method. The time fir&s;t agreed on, though but &s;hort, was thought &s;ufficient to give opportunity for judgment and experience, and for &s;uch as were di&s;|po&s;ed to union in an affair of &s;uch a nature, in di&s;tant places, mutually to communicate their &s;entiments on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The way, which tho&s;e that fir&s;t projected and came into this agreement, thought be&s;t for the giving notice of it and propo&s;ing it to others, was not by any thing publi&s;hed from the pre&s;s, but by per&s;onal conver&s;ation with &s;uch as they could conveniently have immediate acce&s;s to, and by private corre&s;|pondence with others at a di&s;tance. At fir&s;t it was intended, that &s;ome formal paper pro|po&s;ing
<PB N="88" REF="026594_0089_0FD07FD704B82910">po&s;ing the matter, &s;hould be &s;ent about for proper amendments and improvements, and then concurrence; but on more mature de|liberation, it was con&s;idered how this might give a handle to objections, (which they tho't it be&s;t, to the utmo&s;t, to avoid in the infan|cy of the affair) and how practicable it was, without any &s;uch formality, to &s;pread the &s;ub&s;tance of the propo&s;al by private letters, together with a reque&s;t to their corre&s;pond|ents, mutually to communicate their tho'ts. Therefore this was fixed on, as the method that was preferable at the beginning. Ac|cordingly, they propo&s;ed and endeavoured to promote the affair in this way, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that great numbers in Scotland and England fell in with the propo&s;al, and &s;ome in North America. As to Scotland, it was complied with by numbers, in the four chief towns, Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">burgh, Gla&s;gow, Aberdeen, and Dundee, and many country towns and congregations in various parts of the land. One of the mini&s;ters, that was pri|marily concerned in this affair, in a letter to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne of his corre&s;pondents, &s;peaks of an ex|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icit declaration of the concurrence of the praying &s;ocieties in Edinburgh, which they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade in a letter. The number of the
<PB N="89" REF="026594_0090_0FD07FE783B06988">praying &s;ocieties in that city is very con&s;i|derable. Mr. Robe, of Kil&s;yth, (in a letter to Mr. Prince, of Bo&s;ton, dated November 3, 1743.) &s;ays&mdash;There were then above thirty &s;ocieties of young people there, newly erected, &s;ome of which con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of thir|ty members.&mdash;As to Gla&s;gow, this union was unanimou&s;ly agreed to by about forty-five praying &s;ocieties there, as an eminent mini&s;|ter in that city informs, in a letter.</P>
<P>The two years, fir&s;t agreed on, ended la&s;t November. A little before this time expir|ed, a number of mini&s;ters in Scotland agreed on a memorial, to be printed and &s;ent abroad to their brethren in various parts, propo&s;ing to them, and reque&s;ting of them, to join with them in the continuance of this method of united prayer, and in endeavours to pro|mote it. Copies of which memorial have lately been &s;ent over into New-England, to the number of near five hundred, directed to be di&s;tributed in almo&s;t every county in this province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and al&s;o in &s;everal parts of Connecticut, New-Hamp&s;hire, Rhode-I&s;land, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. The mo&s;t, I &s;up|po&s;e,

It being &s;hort, I &s;hall here in&s;ert a copy of it at length &mdash;It is as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A <HI>MEMORIAL</HI> from &s;everal Mini&s;ters in Scot|land, to their Brethren in different places, for continuing a <HI>CONCERT</HI> for <HI>PRAYER,</HI> fir&s;t entered into in the Year <HI>1744.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it was the chief &s;cope of this concert, to promote more a|bundant application to a duty that is per|petually binding, <HI>prayer that our Lord's king|dom may come,</HI> joined with <HI>prai&s;es;</HI> and it contained &s;ome circum&s;tantial expedients, apprehended to be very &s;ub&s;ervient to that de&s;ign, relating to &s;tated times for &s;uch ex|erci&s;es, &s;o far as this would not interfere with other duties; particularly a part of Satur|day evening and Sabbath morning, every week; and more &s;olemnly of &s;ome one of the fir&s;t days of each of the four great divi|&s;ions of the year, that is, of each quarter; as the fir&s;t Tue&s;day, or fir&s;t convenient day af|ter;

<P N="2">2. To induce tho&s;e already engaged to adhere, and others to accede to this con|cert, it &s;eems of importance to ob&s;erve, that declarations of concurrence, the communi|cating and &s;preading of which are &s;o evi|dently u&s;eful, are to be under&s;tood in &s;uch a latitude, as to keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from entangling mens' minds: not as bind|ing men to &s;et apart any &s;tated days from &s;ecular affairs, or even to fix on any part of
<PB N="92" REF="026594_0093_0FD0B2D59A154EA0">&s;uch and &s;uch preci&s;e days, whether it be convenient or not; nor as ab&s;olute promi&s;es in any re&s;pect, but as friendly, harmonious re&s;olutions, with liberty to alter circum&s;tan|ces as &s;hall be found expedient. On account of all which latitude, and that the circum|&s;tantial part extends only to a few years, it is apprehended, the concert cannot be liable to the objections again&s;t periodical religious times of human appointment.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is al&s;o humbly offered to the con&s;i|deration of mini&s;ters, and others furni&s;hed with gifts for the mo&s;t public in&s;tructions, whether it might not be of great u&s;e, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, if &s;hort and nervous &s;crip|ture per&s;ua&s;ives and directions to the duty in view, were compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed, (either by particular authors, or &s;everal joining to|gether, which la&s;t way might &s;ometimes have peculiar advantages) and that, from time to time, without too great intervals, the better to keep alive on mens' minds a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the obligations to a duty &s;o important in it|&s;elf, and in which many may be in danger to faint and turn remi&s;s, without &s;uch re|peated incitements; and whether it would not al&s;o be of great u&s;e, if mini&s;ters would be plea&s;ed to preach frequently on the im|portance
<PB N="93" REF="026594_0094_0FD0B2D6E88229B8">and nece&s;&s;ity of prayer for the com|ing of our Lord's kingdom, particularly near the quarterly days, or on the&s;e days them|&s;elves, where there is public wor&s;hip at that time.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who have found it incumbent on them to publi&s;h this Memorial at this time, having peculiar advantages for &s;preading it, do intreat that the de&s;ire of concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, contained in it, may, by no means, be under&s;tood as re&s;tricted to any particular denomination or party, or to tho&s;e who are of &s;uch or &s;uch opinions about any former in&s;tances of remarkable religious concern; but to be extended to all who &s;hall vouch|&s;afe any attention to this paper, and have at heart the intere&s;t of vital chri&s;tianity, and the power of godline&s;s; and who, however differing about other things, are convinced of the importance of fervent prayer, to pro|mote that common intere&s;t, and of &s;cripture per&s;ua&s;ives to promote &s;uch prayer.</P>
<P N="5">5. As the fir&s;t printed account of this con|cert was not a propo&s;al of it, as a thing then to begin, but a narration of it, as a de&s;ign already &s;et on &s;oot, which had been brought about with much harmony, by means of pri|vate letters, &s;o the farther countinuance, and,
<PB N="94" REF="026594_0095_0FD0B2D866288248">it is hoped, the farther &s;preading of it &s;eems in a promi&s;ing way of being promoted by the &s;ame means, as importunate de&s;ires of the renewing the concert have been tran&s;|mitted already from a very di&s;tant corner a|broad, where the regard to it has of late in|crea&s;ed; but, notwith&s;tanding of what may be done by private letters, it is humbly ex|pected, that a memorial &s;pread in this man|ner may, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, farther promote the good ends in view, as it may be u&s;efully referred to in letters, and may reach where they will not.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whereas in a valuable letter, from the corner ju&s;t now mentioned, as a place where regard to the concert has lately increa&s;ed, it is propo&s;ed, that it &s;hould be continued for &s;even years, or at lea&s;t for a much longer time than what was &s;pecified in the fir&s;t a|greement; tho&s;e concerned in this memo|rial, who would wi&s;h rather to receive and &s;pread directions and propo&s;als on this head, than to be the fir&s;t authors of any, appre|hend no inconvenience, for their part, in a|greeing to the &s;even years, with the latitude above de&s;cribed, which re&s;erves liberty to make &s;uch circum&s;tantial alterations, as may be hereafter found expedient; on the con|trary,
<PB N="95" REF="026594_0096_0FD0B2D9E9056B48">it &s;eems of importance, that the la|bour of &s;preading a concert, which has al|ready extended to &s;o di&s;tant parts, and may, it is hoped, extend farther, may not need to be renewed &s;ooner, at lea&s;t much &s;ooner, as it is uncertain but that may endanger the dropping of it, and it &s;eems probable, there will be le&s;s zeal in &s;preading of it, if the time propo&s;ed for its continuance be too incon|&s;iderable. Mean time, declarations of con|currence for a le&s;s number of years may greatly promote the good ends in view, tho' it &s;eems very expedient, that it &s;hould ex|ceed what was fir&s;t agreed on, &s;eeing it is found on trial, that that time, in&s;tead of be|ing too long, was much too &s;hort.</P>
<P N="7">7. If per&s;ons who formerly agreed to this concert, &s;hould now di&s;continue it, would it not look too like that fainting in prayer, a|gain&s;t which we are &s;o expre&s;sly warned in &s;cripture? And would not this be the more un&s;uitable at this time, in any within the Briti&s;h dominions, when they have the u|nited calls of &s;uch public cha&s;ti&s;ements and deliverances, to more concern than ever a|bout public reformation, and con&s;equently about that which is the &s;ource of all tho|rough reformation, the regenerating and

<P>I NOW proceed to the &s;econd thing in|tended in this di&s;cour&s;e, viz. to offer to con&s;ideration &s;ome things, which may tend to induce the people of God to comply with the propo&s;al and reque&s;t made to them in the Memorial.</P>
<P>And I de&s;ire that the following things may be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is evident, from the &s;cripture, that there is yet remaining a great advancement of the intere&s;t of religion, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t, in this world, by an abundant out|pouring of the Spirit of God, far greater and more exten&s;ive than ever yet has been. It is certain, that many things, which are &s;poken concerning a glorious time of the church's enlargement and pro&s;perity, in the latter days, have never yet been fulfilled. There has never yet been any propagation and pre|vailing of religion, in any wi&s;e, of that ex|tent and univer&s;ality, which the prophecies
<PB N="98" REF="026594_0099_0FD0B2DE724A63C0">repre&s;ent. It is often foretold and &s;ignified, in a great variety of &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, that there &s;hould a time come, when all nations, through the whole habitable world, &s;hould embrace the true religion, and be brought into the church of God. It was often pro|mi&s;ed to the patriarchs, that <HI>in their &s;eed all the nations,</HI> or, (as it is &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed) <HI>all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Agreeably to this, it is &s;aid of the Me&s;&s;iah, That <HI>all nations &s;hall &s;erve him,</HI> and <HI>men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him, and all nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> And it is &s;aid, that <HI>all nations &s;hall flow unto the mountain of the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> And, that <HI>all nations &s;hall be gathered unto the name of the Lord to Jeru&s;alem, and &s;hall walk no more after the imagination of their evil heart.</HI> So it is &s;aid, that <HI>all fle&s;h &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before the Lord.</HI> And that <HI>all fle&s;h &s;hould &s;ee the glory of God together.</HI> And that <HI>all fle&s;h &s;hould come to him that hears prayer.</HI> Chri&s;t compares the kingdom of heav|en, in this world, to leaven, <HI>which a woman took and hid in three mea&s;ures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</HI> It is natural and rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, that the whole world &s;hould finally be given to Chri&s;t, as one who&s;e right it is to reign, as the proper heir of him who
<PB N="99" REF="026594_0100_0FD0B2DFE73B59A8">is originally the king of all nations, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth; and the &s;crip|ture teaches us, that God the Father had con|&s;tituted his Son, as God-Man, and in his kingdom of grace, or mediatorial kingdom, to be the <HI>heir of the world,</HI> that he might in this kingdom have <HI>the heathen for his inheri|tance, and the utmo&s;t ends of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Thus Abraham is &s;aid to be <HI>the heir of the world,</HI> not in him&s;elf, but in <HI>his &s;eed,</HI> which is Chri&s;t. And how was this to be fulfilled to Abraham, but by God's fulfill|ing that great promi&s;e. that <HI>in his &s;eed all the nations of the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed?</HI> For that promi&s;e is what the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of; which &s;hews, that God has appointed Chri&s;t to be the heir of the world in his king|dom of grace, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s and reign over all nations, through the propagation of his go&s;pel, and the power of his Spirit commu|nicating the ble&s;&s;ings of it. God had ap|pointed him to this univer&s;al dominion by a mo&s;t &s;olemn oath: <HI>I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that unto me e|very knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear.</HI> Though this &s;olemn oath of God the Father is to be under&s;tood in &s;o comprehen&s;ive a
<PB N="100" REF="026594_0101_0FD0B2E173C82250">&s;en&s;e, as to extend to what &s;hall be accom|pli&s;hed at the day of judgment, yet it is evi|dent by the foregoing and following ver&s;es, that the thing mo&s;t directly intended, is what &s;hall be fulfilled by the &s;preading of the go&s;|pel of his &s;alvation, and power of the Spirit of grace, bringing <HI>all the ends of the earth to look to him that they may be &s;aved,</HI> and come to him for <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength</HI> that, <HI>in him they might be ju&s;tified, and might glory.</HI> God has &s;uffered many earthly princes to ex|tend their conque&s;ts over a great part of the face of the earth, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s a dominion of a va&s;t extent, and one monarchy to con|quer and &s;ucceed another, the latter being &s;till the greater; it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that a much greater glory in this re&s;pect &s;hould be re&s;erved for Chri&s;t, God's own &s;on and rightful heir, who has purcha&s;ed the do|minion by &s;o great and hard a &s;ervice; it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that his dominion &s;hould be far the large&s;t, and his conque&s;ts va&s;tly the greate&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive. And thus the &s;criptures repre&s;ent the matter, in Nebuchadnezzar's vi&s;ion, and the prophet's interpretation, Dan. ii. There the four great monarchies of the earth, one &s;ucceeding an|other, are repre&s;ented by <HI>the great image of
<PB N="101" REF="026594_0102_0FD0B2E2E7679DB0">gold, &s;ilver, bra&s;s, iron and clay;</HI> but at la&s;t <HI>a &s;tone, cut out of the mountains without hands, &s;mites the image upon his feet, which breaks the iron, clay, bra&s;s, &s;ilver and gold in pieces, that all becomes as the chaff of the &s;ummer thre&s;hing floors, and the wind carries them away, that no place is found for them; but the &s;tone waxes great, becomes a great mountain, and</HI> FILLS THE WHOLE EARTH; &s;ignifying the kingdom which the Lord God of heav|en &s;hould &s;et up in the world, la&s;t of all, which &s;hould break in pieces and con&s;ume all other kingdoms. Surely this repre&s;en|tation leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that this la&s;t king|dom &s;hall be of va&s;tly greater extent than any of the preceding. The like repre&s;en|tation is made in the viith chapter of Daniel; there the four monarchies are repre&s;ented by four great bea&s;ts that aro&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, one conquering and &s;ubduing another; the fourth and la&s;t of the&s;e is &s;aid to be <HI>dreadful</HI> and <HI>terrible,</HI> and <HI>&s;trong exceedingly,</HI> and <HI>to have great iron teeth,</HI> and <HI>to devour and break in pieces, and &s;tamp the re&s;idue with his feet;</HI> yea, it is &s;aid, ver&s;e 23, that the kingdom repre&s;ented by this bea&s;t &s;hall <HI>devour the whole earth;</HI> but la&s;t of all, <HI>one like the Son of Man</HI> appears, <HI>coming to the Ancient of

<P>It would be unrea&s;onable to &s;ay, the&s;e are only bold figures, u&s;ed after the manner of the ea&s;tern nations, to expre&s;s the great ex|tent of the Chri&s;tian church, at and after the days of Con&s;tantine; to &s;ay &s;o, would be in effect to &s;ay, that it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible for God, if he had de&s;ired it, plainly to have foretold any thing that &s;hould ab&s;o|lutely have extended to all nations of the earth.

<P>The prophecies of the New Te&s;tament do no le&s;s evidently &s;hew, that a time will come when the go&s;pel &s;hall univer&s;ally prevail, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t be extended over the whole habitable earth, in the mo&s;t pro|per &s;en&s;e.

The apo&s;tle, in the with of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|mans,
<PB N="107" REF="026594_0108_0FD0B2EB4F3C1DB0">teaches us to look on that great out|pouring of the Spirit and in-gathering of &s;ouls into Chri&s;t's kingdom, that was in tho&s;e days, fir&s;t of the Jews, and then of the Gen|tiles, to be but as the fir&s;t-fruits of the in|tended harve&s;t, both with regard to Jews and Gentiles; and to look on the in-gather|ing of tho&s;e fir&s;t fruits as a &s;ign that all the remainder both of Jews and Gentiles &s;hall in due time be gathered in. <HI>For if the fir&s;t-fruit be holy, the lump is al&s;o holy: and if the root be holy, &s;o are the branches.</HI> And in that context, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the FULNESS of both Jews and Gentiles, as what &s;hall hereafter be brought in, as di&s;tinct from that in-gathering from among both, which was in tho&s;e primitive ages of Chri&s;|tianity; we read of the fulne&s;s of the Jews, and of the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles; and the apo&s;tle teaches us to look upon that infideli|ty and darkne&s;s, which fir&s;t prevailed over all Gentile nations, before Chri&s;t came, and then over the Jews after Chri&s;t came, as what was wi&s;ely permitted of God, as a prepara|tion for the manife&s;tation of the glory of God's mercy, in due time, on the whole world, con&s;tituted of Jews and Gentiles.

<PB N="108" REF="026594_0109_0FD0B2ECD29F8C30">that he might have mercy upon all.

<P>In the la&s;t great conflict between the church of Chri&s;t and her enemies, before the commencement of the glorious time of the church's peace and re&s;t, the kings of the earth, and the <HI>whole world,</HI> are repre&s;ented as gathered together, and then the &s;eventh angel pours out his vial into the air, which limits that kingdom that Satan has, as god of this world, in its utmo&s;t extent;&mdash;and that kingdom is repre&s;ented as utterly over|thrown. In another de&s;cription of that great battle, Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as riding forth, having on his head many crowns, and on his ve&s;ture and on his thigh a name writ|ten, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. Which we may well &s;uppo&s;e &s;ignifies, that he is now going to that conque&s;t, whereby he &s;hall &s;et up a kingdom, in which he &s;hall be

And an angel appears &s;tanding in the &s;un, that over|looks the whole world, calling on all the fowls that fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, to come and eat the fle&s;h of kings, &amp;c. And in con&s;equence of the great victory Chri&s;t gains at that time, <HI>an angel comes down from heaven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit, and a great ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in in his hand, and lays hold on the devil, and binds him, and ca&s;ts him in|to the bottomle&s;s pit, and &s;huts him up, and &s;ets a &s;eal upon him, that he &s;hould deceive the nations no more.</HI> Satan's being di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of that highe&s;t monarchy on earth, the Roman empire, and ca&s;t out, in the time of Con&s;tantine, is repre&s;ented by his being ca&s;t down from heaven to the earth; but now there is &s;omething far beyond that; he is ca&s;t out of the earth, and is &s;hut up in hell, and confined to that alone, &s;o that he has no place left him in this world of man|kind, high or low.</P>
<P>Now will any be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to &s;ay, that all the&s;e things do not &s;ignify more than that one third part of the world &s;hould be brought into the church of Chri&s;t, beyond

<P>The&s;e things make it very evident, that the main fulfilment of tho&s;e prophecies that &s;peak of the glorious advancement of Chri&s;t's kingdom on earth, is &s;till to come.</P>
<P>And as there has been nothing as yet, with regard to the flouri&s;hing of religion, and the advancement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, of &s;uch extent as to an&s;wer the prophecies, &s;o nei|ther has there been any thing of that dura|tion that is foretold.

<P N="3">3. How much Chri&s;t prayed and labour|ed and &s;uffered, in order to the glory and happine&s;s of that day.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the ble&s;&s;ings Chri&s;t &s;ought, by what he did and &s;uffered in the work of re|demption, was the Holy Spirit. So is the affair of our redemption con&s;tituted; the Father provides and gives the Redeemer, and the price of redemption is offered to him, and he grants the benefit purcha&s;ed; the Son is the redeemer who gives the price, and al&s;o is the price offered; and the Holy Spirit is the grand ble&s;&s;ing obtained by the
<PB N="123" REF="026594_0124_0FD0B304A6FC06B8">price offered, and be&s;towed on the redeemed. The Holy Spirit, in his in-dwelling, his in|fluences and fruits, is the &s;um of all grace, holine&s;s, comfort and joy; or in one word, of all the &s;piritual good Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for men in this world; and is al&s;o the &s;um of all perfection, glory and eternal joy, that he purcha&s;ed for them in another world. The Holy Spirit is that great benefit, which is the &s;ubject-matter of the promi&s;es, both of the eternal covenant of redemption, and al&s;o of the covenant of grace; the grand &s;ubject of the promi&s;es of the Old Te&s;tament, in the prophecies of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Me&s;|&s;iah's kingdom; and the chief &s;ubject of the promi&s;es of the New Te&s;tament; and par|ticularly of the covenant of grace delivered by Je&s;us Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his di&s;ciples, as his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, in the xiv. xv. and xvi. chapters of John; the grand legacy that he bequeathed to them, in that his la&s;t and dy|ing di&s;cour&s;e with them. Therefore the Ho|ly Spirit is &s;o often called the &s;pirit of pro|mi&s;e, and emphatically, the promi&s;e, the pro|mi&s;e of the Father, &amp;c. This being the great ble&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed by his labours and &s;ufferings on earth, it was the ble&s;&s;ing he received of the Father, when he a&s;cended
<PB N="124" REF="026594_0125_0FD0B3063052AAA0">into heaven, and entered into the holy of holies with his own blood, to communicate to tho&s;e that he had redeemed. <HI>It is expe|dient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come; but if I depart, I will &s;end him unto you. Being by the right hand of God exalted, and having re|ceived of the Father the promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, he hath &s;hed forth this which ye now &s;ee and hear.</HI> This is the &s;um of tho&s;e gifts, which Chri&s;t received for men, even for the rebellious, at his a&s;cen&s;ion. This is the &s;um of the benefits Chri&s;t obtains for men by his interce&s;&s;ion. <HI>I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever&mdash;even the &s;pirit of truth.</HI> Herein con&s;i&s;ts Chri&s;t's communica|tive fulne&s;s, even in his being full of the Spirit, and &s;o full of grace and truth, that we might of this fulne&s;s receive, and grace for grace. He is anointed with the Holy Gho&s;t; and this is the ointment that goes down from the head to the members. God gives the Spirit not by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> unto him, that every one that is his might receive according to the mea&s;ure of the gift of Chri&s;t. This, there|fore, was the great ble&s;&s;ing he prayed for in that wonderful prayer, that he uttered for
<PB N="125" REF="026594_0126_0FD0B307A9EE7770">his di&s;ciples, and all his future church, the evening before he died. The ble&s;&s;ing he pray|ed for to the Father, in behalf of his di&s;ciples, was the &s;ame he had in&s;i&s;ted on in his preced|ing di&s;cour&s;e with them; and this, doubtle&s;s, was the ble&s;&s;ing he prayed for when, as our High Prie&s;t, he offered up &s;trong crying and tears, with his blood. The &s;ame that he &s;hed his blood for, he al&s;o &s;hed tears for, and pour+ed out prayers for.</P>
<P>But the time that we have been &s;peaking of, is the chief time of the be&s;towment of this ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;the main &s;ea&s;on of the &s;ucce&s;s of all that Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered in the work of our redemption. Before this the Spirit of God is given but very &s;paringly, and but few are &s;aved; but then it will be far other|wi&s;e; wickedne&s;s &s;hall be rare then, as vir|tue and piety had been before; and, un|doubtedly, by far the greate&s;t number of them that ever receive the benefits of Chri&s;t's redemption, from the beginning of the world to the end of it, will receive it in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The number of the inhabitants of the earth will, doubtle&s;s, then be va&s;tly multiplied, and the number of redeemed ones much more. If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that glorious day to la&s;t no more than (literally) a thou|&s;and
<PB N="126" REF="026594_0127_0FD0B30929DC4730">years, and that at the beginning of that thou&s;and years the world of mankind &s;hould be but ju&s;t as numerous as it is now, and that the number &s;hould be doubled, during that time of great health and peace, and the univer&s;al ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, once only in an hundred years, the number at the end of the thou&s;and years would be more than a thou|&s;and times greater than it is now; and if it &s;hould be doubled once in fifty years, (which probably the number of inhabitants of New-England has ordinarily been, in about half that time) then at the end of the thou&s;and years, there would be more than a million inhabitants on the face of the earth, where there is one now. And there is rea&s;on to think, that through the greater part of this period, at lea&s;t, the number of &s;aints will, in their increa&s;e, bear a proportion to the in|crea&s;e of the number of inhabitants. And it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that if the number of mankind at the beginning of this period be no more than equal to the pre&s;ent number, yet we may doubtle&s;s conclude, that the number of true &s;aints will be immen&s;ely greater, when in&s;tead of the few true and thorough Chri&s;tians now in &s;ome few coun|tries, every nation on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of the whole

How much greater then will be the number of true converts, that will be brought to a par|ticipation of the benefits of Chri&s;t's redemp|tion, during that period, than in all other times put together?

Becau&s;e the creature it&s;elf al&s;o &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</HI>&mdash; The vi&s;ible world has now, for many ages,
<PB N="131" REF="026594_0132_0FD0B30F26F03B30">been &s;ubjected to &s;in, and made, as it were, a &s;ervant to it, through the abu&s;ive improve|ment that man, who has the dominion over the creatures, puts the creatures to. Thus the &s;un is a &s;ort of &s;ervant to all manner of wickedne&s;s, as its light, and other beneficial influences are abu&s;ed by men, and made &s;ub|&s;ervient to their lu&s;ts and &s;inful purpo&s;es. So of the rain, and fruits of the earth, and the brute animals, and all other parts of the vi&s;ible creation; they all &s;erve mens' cor|ruption, and obey their &s;inful will; and God doth, in a &s;ort, &s;ubject them to it, for he con|tinues his influence and power to make them to be obedient, according to the &s;ame law of nature, whereby they yield to mens' com|mand when u&s;ed to good purpo&s;es. It is by the immediate influence of God upon things, acting upon them, according to tho&s;e con|&s;tant methods which we call the laws of na|ture, that they are ever obedient to mens' will, or that we can u&s;e them at all. This influence God continues to make them obe|dient to mens' will though wicked; which is a &s;ure &s;ign that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things is not la&s;ting, it is confu&s;ion, and God would not &s;uffer it to be, but that he de&s;igns, in a little time, to put an end to it, when it &s;hall
<PB N="132" REF="026594_0133_0FD07FD282FF1700">no more be &s;o. Seeing it is to be but a lit|tle while, God chu&s;es rather to &s;ubject the creature to man's wickedne&s;s, than to di&s;|turb and interrupt the cour&s;e of nature ac|cording to its &s;tated laws; but it is, as it were, a force upon the creature; for the crea|ture is abu&s;ed in it, perverted to far meaner purpo&s;es than tho&s;e for which the author of its nature made it, and to which he adapted it. The creature, therefore, is, as it were, unwillingly &s;ubject, and would not be &s;ub|ject, but that it is but for a &s;hort time, and it, as it were, hopes for an alteration. It is a bondage the creature is &s;ubject to, from which it was partly delivered when Chri&s;t came, and the go&s;pel was promulgated in the world, and will be more fully delivered at the commencement of the glorious day we are &s;peaking of, and perfectly at the day of judgment. This agrees with the context, for the apo&s;tle was &s;peaking of the pre&s;ent fuffering &s;tate of the church. The rea&s;on why the church in this world is in a &s;uffer|ing &s;tate, is, that the world is &s;ubjected to the &s;in and corruption of mankind. By va|nity, in &s;cripture, is very commonly meant &s;in and wickedne&s;s, and al&s;o by corruption, as might be &s;hewn in many places would my intended brevity allow.</P>

Though the creature is thus &s;ubject to va|nity, yet it does not re&s;t in this &s;ubjection, but is con&s;tantly acting and exerting it&s;elf, in or|der to that glorious liberty that God has ap|pointed at the time we are &s;peaking of, and, as it were, reaching forth towards it.

<P>Be&s;ides what has been ob&s;erved of the Lord's prayer, if we look through the whole Bible, and ob&s;erve all the examples of prayer that we find there recorded, we &s;hall not find &s;o many prayers for any other mercy, as for the deliverance, re&s;toration, and pro&s;perity of the church, and the advancement of God's glory and kingdom of grace in the world. If we well con&s;ider the prayers that we find recorded in the book of P&s;alms, I believe we &s;hall &s;ee rea&s;on to think, that a very great, if not the greater part of them, are prayers uttered, either in the name of Chri&s;t, or in the name of the church, for &s;uch a mercy; and undoubtedly, the greate&s;t part of that book of P&s;alms, is made up of prayers for this mercy, prophecies of it, and pro|phetical prai&s;es for it.</P>
<P>The prophets, in their prophecies of the re&s;toration and advancement of the church, very often &s;peak of it as what &s;hall be done in an&s;wer to the prayers of God's people. I&s;ai: xxv. 9.&mdash;xxvi. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17. to the end. Chap. xxxiii. 2. P&s;al. cii. 13&mdash;22. Jer. iii. 21. I&s;ai. lxv. 24.&mdash;xli. 17. Ho&s;. v. 15. with vi. 1, 2, 3. and xiv. 2. to the

Chap. lxiii. 11. to the end, and lxiv. throughout.</P>
<P>In order to Chri&s;t's being my&s;tically born into the world, in the advancement and flou|ri&s;hing of true religion, and great increa&s;e of the number of true converts who are &s;po|ken of as having Chri&s;t formed in them, the &s;criptures repre&s;ent it as requi&s;ite, that the church &s;hould fir&s;t be in travail, crying, and pained to be delivered. And one thing that we have good rea&s;on to under&s;tand by it, is her exerci&s;ing &s;trong de&s;ires, and wre&s;tling and agonizing with God in prayer for this event; becau&s;e we find &s;uch figures of &s;peech u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e el&s;ewhere. <HI>My little chil|dren, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chri&s;t be formed in you. Lord, in trouble have they vi&s;ited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy cha&s;tening was upon them.

<PB N="144" REF="026594_0145_0FD0B322A727CDC0">Lord.</HI> And certainly it is fit, that the church of God &s;hould be in travail for that, which (as I before ob&s;erved) the whole creation tra|vails in pain for.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures do not only abundantly manife&s;t it to be the duty of God's peo|ple to be much in prayer for this great mer|cy, but they al&s;o abound with manifold con&s;i|derations to encourage them in it, and ani|mate them with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. There is, perhaps, no one thing that &s;o much of the Bible is taken up in the promi&s;es of, in or|der to encourage the faith, hope, and pray|ers of the &s;aints as this, which at once af|fords to God's people the cleare&s;t evidences that it is their duty to be much in prayer for this mercy, (for, undoubtedly, that which God does abundantly make the &s;ubject of his promi&s;es, God's people &s;hould abundant|ly make the &s;ubject of their prayers) and al&s;o affords them the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances that their prayers &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful. With what con&s;idence may we go before God, and pray for that, of which we have &s;o many exceed|ing precious and glorious promi&s;es to plead? The very fir&s;t promi&s;e of God to fallen man, even that <HI>it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head,</HI> is a pro|mi&s;e which is to have its chief fulfilment at
<PB N="145" REF="026594_0146_0FD0B32426E755D8">that day; and the whole Bible concludes with a promi&s;e of the glory of that day, and a prayer for its fulfilment. <HI>He that te&s;tifieth the&s;e things, &s;aith&mdash;Surely, I come quickly&mdash; Amen. Even &s;o, come, Lord Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;cripture gives us great rea&s;on to think, that when once there comes to appear much of a &s;pirit of prayer in the church of God for this mercy, then it will &s;oon be ac|compli&s;hed. It is evidently with reference to this mercy, that God makes that promi&s;e, <HI>When the poor and needy &s;eek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thir&s;t, I, the Lord, will hear them; I, the God of I&s;|rael, will not for&s;ake them; I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the mid&s;t of the vallies; I will make the wilderne&s;s a pool of water, and the dry land &s;prings of water; I will plant in the wilderne&s;s the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dar, the &s;hittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will &s;et in the de&s;art the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together.</HI> Spiritual waters and rivers are explained by the apo&s;tle John, to be the Holy Spirit. It is now a time of &s;carcity of the&s;e &s;piritual waters; there are, as it were, none: If God's people, in this time of great drought, were but made duly

Who knows but that the generation here &s;poken of, may be this pre&s;ent generation? One thing mentioned in the character of that future generation, is certainly true concern|ing the pre&s;ent, viz. That it is de&s;titute; the church of God is in very low, &s;orrowful and needy circum&s;tances; and if the next thing, there &s;uppo&s;ed, were al&s;o verified in us, viz.
<PB N="147" REF="026594_0148_0FD0B327272652D8">That we were made &s;en&s;ible of our great ca|lamity, and brought to cry earne&s;tly to God for help, I am per&s;uaded that the third would be al&s;o verified, viz.

It is &s;poken of as a &s;ign and evidence, that the time to favour Zion is come, when God's &s;ervants are brought, by their prayerfulne&s;s for her re&s;toration, in an eminent manner, to &s;hew that <HI>they favour her &s;tones and du&s;t.

There we read of &s;even angels &s;tanding before the throne of God, and receiving of him &s;even trumpets, at the &s;ounding of which great and mighty changes were to be brought to pa&s;s in the world, through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages. But when the&s;e angels had received their trumpets, they mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till, and all mu&s;t be in &s;ilence, not one of them mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ound, until the prayers of the
<PB N="148" REF="026594_0149_0FD0B328A7CA5EF0">&s;aints are attended to. The angel of the co|venant, as a glorious High Prie&s;t, comes and &s;tands at the altar, with much incen&s;e, to of|fer with the prayers of all &s;aints upon the golden altar, before the throne; and the &s;moke of the incen&s;e, with the prayers of the &s;aints, a&s;cends up with acceptance be|fore God, out of the angel's hand; and then the angels prepare them&s;elves to &s;ound.&mdash;And God, in the events of every trumpet, remembers tho&s;e prayers, as appears at la&s;t, by the great and glorious things he accom|pli&s;hes for his church, in the i&s;&s;ue of all, in an&s;wer to the&s;e prayers, in the event of the la&s;t trumpet, which brings the glory of the latter days, when the&s;e prayers &s;hall be turn|ed into joyful prai&s;es. Rev. xi. 15, 16, 17. <HI>And the &s;eventh angel &s;ounded, and there were great voices in heaven, &s;aying&mdash;The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t; and he &s;hall reign for ever and ever. And the four-and-twenty elders, which &s;at before God on their &s;eats, fell upon their faces, and wor&s;hipped God, &s;aying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wa&s;t, and art to come, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t taken to thee thy great power, and
<PB N="149" REF="026594_0150_0FD0B32A3808F0B0">ha&s;t reigned.</HI> Since it is thus, that it is the plea&s;ure of God &s;o to honor his people, as to carry on all the de&s;igns of his kingdom in this way, viz. by the prayers of his &s;aints; this gives us great rea&s;on to think, that whenever the time comes that God gives an extraordinary &s;pirit of prayer for the pro|mi&s;ed advancement of his kingdom on earth, (which is God's great aim in all preceding providences, and which is the main thing that the &s;pirit of prayer in the &s;aints aims at) then the fulfilling this event is nigh.</P>
<P>God, in wonderful grace, is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent him&s;elf, as it were, at the command of his people, with regard to mercies of this nature, &s;o as to be ready to be&s;tow them whenever they &s;hall earne&s;tly pray for them. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, the holy O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of I&s;rael, and his maker, A&s;k of me of things to come, concerning my &s;ons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</HI> What God is &s;peaking of in this context, is the re&s;toration of his church; not only a re&s;toration from temporal calamity, and an outward captivi|ty by Cyrus; but al&s;o a &s;piritual re&s;toration and advancement, by God's commanding the heavens to <HI>drop down from above, and the &s;kies to pour down righteou&s;ne&s;s, and cau|&s;ing

Becau&s;e it is prayer for his own church, his cho&s;en and beloved people, <HI>his &s;ons and daughters, and the work of his hands;</HI> and he cannot deny any thing that is a&s;ked for their comfort and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>God &s;peaks of him&s;elf as &s;tanding ready to be gracious to his church, and to appear for its re&s;toration, and only waiting for &s;uch an opportunity to be&s;tow this mercy, when he &s;hall hear the cries of his people for it, that he may be&s;tow it in an&s;wer to their prayers. <HI>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious to thee; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: For the Lord is a God of judgment; ble&s;&s;ed are all they that wait for him.

<PB N="151" REF="026594_0152_0FD0B32D5FABDD48">The words imply as much as that when God once &s;ees his people much engaged in pray|ing for this mercy, it &s;hall be no longer de|layed.

When the &s;pou&s;e prays for the effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, and the coming of Chri&s;t, by granting the tokens of his &s;piritual pre|&s;ence in the church, &s;aying, <HI>Awake, O north wind, and come, thou &s;outh, blow upon my garden, that the &s;pices thereof may flow out;

<P>Scripture in&s;tances and examples of &s;uc|ce&s;s in prayer, give great encouragement to pray for this mercy. Mo&s;t of the remark|able deliverances and re&s;torations of the church of God, that we have account of in the &s;criptures, were in an&s;wer to prayer. So was the redemption of the church of God from the Egyptian bondage. The great re&s;toration of the church in the latter day, is &s;poken of as re&s;embled by this; as in I&s;ai. lxiv. 1&mdash;4. xi. 11, 15, 16. xliii. 2, 3, 16&mdash;19. li. 10, 11, 15. lxiii. 11, 12, 13. Zech. x. 10, 11. Ho&s;. ii. 14, 15. It was in an&s;wer to prayer, that the &s;un &s;tood &s;till over Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, and God's people obtained that great victory over their enemies: in which
<PB N="153" REF="026594_0154_0FD0B3302ECDA8B0">wonderful miracle, God &s;eemed to have &s;ome re&s;pect to a future more glorious event to be accompli&s;hed for the chri&s;tian church, in the day of her victory over her enemies, in the latter days; even that event foretold, I&s;ai. xl. 20. <HI>Thy &s;un &s;hall no more go down, neither &s;hall thy moon withdraw it&s;elf.</HI> It was in an&s;wer to prayer, that God delivered his church from the mighty ho&s;t of the A&s;|&s;yrians, in Hezekiah's time; which di&s;pen|&s;ation is abundantly made u&s;e of, as a type of the great things God will do for the chri|&s;tian church in the latter days, in the pro|phecies of I&s;aiah. The re&s;toration of the church of God from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, as abundantly appears both by &s;cripture-prophecies and hi&s;tories, was in an&s;wer to extraordinary prayer; &s;ee Jer. xxix. 10&mdash;14. and l. 4, 5. Dan. ix. throughout. Ezra viii. 21, &amp;c. Neh. i. 4. to the end.&mdash;iv. 4, 5. and chap. ix. throughout. This re&s;tora|tion of the Jewi&s;h church, after the de&s;truc|tion of Babylon, is evidently a type of the glorious re&s;toration of the chri&s;tian church, after the de&s;truction of the kingdom of Anti|chri&s;t; which, as all know, is abundantly &s;poken of in the revelation of St. John, as the anti-type of Babylon. Samp&s;on, out of
<PB N="154" REF="026594_0155_0FD0B331A7CC8D88">weakne&s;s, received &s;trength to pull down Dagon's temple, through prayer. So the people of God, in the latter days, will, out of weakne&s;s, be made &s;trong, and will become the in&s;truments of pulling down the king|dom of Satan, by prayer.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God was poured out upon Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in an&s;wer to prayer. <HI>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pa&s;s, that Je&s;us al&s;o being baptized, and pray|ing, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended in a bodily &s;hape like a dove, upon him; and a voice came from heaven, which &s;aid, Thou art my beloved Son, in Thee I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> The Spirit de&s;cendes on the church of Chri&s;t, the &s;ame way, in this re|&s;pect, that it de&s;cended on the head of the church. The greate&s;t effu&s;ion of the Spir|it that ever yet has been, even that which was in the primitive times of the chri&s;tian church, which began in Jeru&s;alem on the day of Penteco&s;t, was in an&s;wer to ex|traordinary prayer. When the di&s;ciples were gathered together to their Lord, a lit|tle before his a&s;cen&s;ion, <HI>he commanded them that they &s;hould not depart from Jeru&s;alem, but wait for the promi&s;e of the Father, which,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>ye have heard of me,</HI> i. e. the pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="026594_0156_0FD0B3332D864FE8">of the Holy Gho&s;t; Acts. i. 4. What they had their hearts upon was the re&s;tora|tion of the kingdom of I&s;rael: <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>wilt thou, at this time, re&s;tore again the kingdom to I&s;rael,</HI> ver. 6. And according to Chri&s;t's direction, after his a&s;cen&s;ion, they returned to Jeru&s;alem, and continued in u|nited fervent prayer and &s;upplication. It &s;eems they &s;pent their time in it from day to day, without cea&s;ing; until the &s;pirit came down in a wonderful manner upon them, and that work was begun which never cea&s;|ed, until the world was turned up&s;ide down, and all the chief nations of it were convert|ed to chri&s;tianity; and that glorious deli|verance and advancement of the chri&s;tian church, that was in the days of Con&s;tantine the Great, followed the extraordinary cries of the church to God, as the matter is repre|&s;ented, Rev. vi. at the opening of the fifth &s;eal. The church, in her &s;uffering &s;tate, is repre&s;ented crying with a loud voice, <HI>How long, Lord, holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge, and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</HI> And the opening of the next &s;eal brings on that mighty revolution, in the days of Con&s;tantine, compared to tho&s;e great changes that &s;hall be at the end of the world.</P>

And if we con&s;ider God's late dealings with our nation and this land, it appears to me that there is much to make us think that this day is &s;uch a day; particularly God's pre&s;erving and delivering the nation, when in &s;o great danger of ruin by the late rebel|lion, and his pre&s;erving New-England, and the other Briti&s;h colonies in America, in &s;o remarkable a manner, from the great arma|ment from France, prepared and &s;ent again&s;t us the la&s;t year; and the almo&s;t miraculous &s;ucce&s;s given to us again&s;t our enemies at Cape-Breton the year before, di&s;appointing their renewed preparations and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t the&s;e colonies, this pre&s;ent year 1747, by delivering up the &s;trength of their fleet into the hands of the Engli&s;h, as they were in their way hither.

God's patience was very wonder|ful of old, towards the ten tribes, and the people of Judah and Jeru&s;alem, and after|wards to the Jews in Chri&s;t's and the apo&s;|tles times; but it &s;eems to me, all things con|&s;idered, not equal to his patience and mercy to us.

And it is to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that God was plea&s;ed to do great things for us in both the&s;e in&s;tances, in an&s;wer to extraordinary prayer. Such remarkable appearances of a &s;pirit of prayer, on any particular public oc|ca&s;ion, have not been in the land, at any time within my ob&s;ervation and memory, as an occa&s;ion of the affair of Cape-Breton.&mdash; And it is worthy to be noted and remember|ed, that God &s;ent that great &s;torm on the fleet of our enemies the la&s;t year, that final|ly di&s;per&s;ed, and utterly confounded them, and cau&s;ed them wholly to give over their de|&s;igns again&s;t us, the very night after our day of public fa&s;ting and prayer, for our protec|tion and their confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, although it be a day of great apo&s;|tacy and provocation, yet it is apparently a day of the wonderful works of God; wonders
<PB N="168" REF="026594_0169_0FD0B346B38B53E8">of power and mercy, which may well lead us to think on tho&s;e two places of &s;cripture, P&s;al. cxix. 126. <HI>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy law.</HI>&mdash; And P&s;al. lxxv. 1. <HI>That thy name is near, thy wonderous works declare.</HI>&mdash;God appears, as it were, loth to de&s;troy us, or deal with us according to our iniquities, as great and aggravated as they are, and &s;hews that mer|cy plea&s;es him.

Since this, there
<PB N="170" REF="026594_0171_0FD0B349A87ADE88">has been a far more exten&s;ive awakening of many thou&s;ands in England, Wales, and Scot|land, and almo&s;t all the Briti&s;h provinces in North America.

Notwith&s;tand|ing the great diver&s;ity of opinions about the i&s;&s;ue of &s;ome of the&s;e awakenings, yet I know of none that have denied that there have been great awakenings of late, in the&s;e times and places, and that multitudes have been brought to more than common concern for their &s;alvation, and for a time were made more than ordinarily afraid of &s;in, and bro't to reform their former vicious cour&s;es, and take much pains for their &s;alvation. If I &s;hould be of the opinion of tho&s;e that think the&s;e awakenings and &s;trivings of God's Spi|rit have been generally not well improved, and &s;o, as to mo&s;t, have not i&s;&s;ued well, but have ended in enthu&s;ia&s;m and delu&s;ion, yet,

<P>Union is one of the mo&s;t amiable things that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtains to human &s;ociety; yea, it is
<PB N="172" REF="026594_0173_0FD0B34CA66C22C8">one of the mo&s;t beautiful and happy things on earth, which indeed makes earth mo&s;t like heaven. God has made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth; hereby teaching us this moral le&s;&s;on, that it becomes mankind all to be u|nited as one family. And this is agreeable to the nature that God has given men, di&s;|po&s;ing them to &s;ociety; and the circum|&s;tances God has placed them in, &s;o many ways obliging and nece&s;&s;itating them to it. A civil union, or an harmonious agreement among men, in the management of their &s;e|cular concerns, is amiable; but much more a pious union, and &s;weet agreement in the great bu&s;ine&s;s for which man was created, and had powers given him beyond the brutes; even the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, the life and &s;oul of which is love. Union is &s;poken of in &s;cripture as the peculiar beauty of the church of Chri&s;t, Cant. vi. 9. <HI>My dove, my undefiled is but one, &s;he is the only one of her mother, &s;he is the choice one of her that bare her; the daughters &s;aw her and ble&s;&s;ed her, yea, the queens and the concubines, and they prai&s;ed her.</HI> P&s;al. cxxii. 5. <HI>Jeru&s;alem is build|ed as a city that is compact together.</HI> Eph. iv.

<P>As it is the glory of the church of Chri&s;t, that &s;he, in all her members, however di&s;|per&s;ed, is thus one, one holy &s;ociety, one city, one family, one body; &s;o it is very de|&s;irable, that this union &s;hould be manife&s;ted, and become vi&s;ible; and &s;o, that her di&s;tant members &s;hould act as one, in tho&s;e things that concern the common intere&s;t of the whole body, and in tho&s;e duties and exer|ci&s;es wherein they have to do with their common lord and head, as &s;eeking of him the common pro&s;perity.

<P>It is becoming of Chri&s;tians, with who&s;e character a narrow &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, above all others, di&s;agrees, to be much in prayer for that public mercy, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the wel|fare and happine&s;s of the whole body of Chri&s;t, of which they are members, and the greate&s;t good of mankind.

<P>Such an union in prayer for the general out-pouring of the Spirit of God, would not only be beautiful, but profitable too.

It is, indeed, &s;uppo&s;ed, that it will be very expedi|ent, that certain times for united prayer &s;hould be agreed on; which it may be with|out implying the thing &s;uppo&s;ed in the ob|jection, on the following accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. This &s;eems to be a proper expedient for the promoting and maintaining an uni|on
<PB N="186" REF="026594_0187_0FD0B3A243F7BB58">among Chri&s;tians of di&s;tant places, in extraordinary prayer for &s;uch a mercy. It appears, from what was before ob&s;erved, that there ought to be extraordinary prayers a|mong Chri&s;tians for this mercy; and that it is &s;it, that God's people &s;hould agree and unite in it. Though there be no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that prayers will be more prevalent, merely from that circum&s;tance, that differ|ent per&s;ons pray exactly at the &s;ame time; yet there will be more rea&s;on to hope, that prayers for &s;uch mercy will be prevalent, when God's people are very much in prayer for it, and when many of them are united in it. If therefore agreeing on certain times for united and extraordinary prayer, be a like|ly means to promote an union of many in ex|traordinary prayer, then there is more rea&s;on to hope that there will be prevalent prayer for &s;uch a mercy, for certain times for extra|ordinary prayer being agreed on. But, that agreement on certain times for united ex|traordinary prayer, is a likely and proper means to promote and maintain &s;uch pray|er, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hink will be ea&s;ily evident to any one that con&s;iders the matter. If there &s;hould be only a loo&s;e agreement or con&s;ent to it as a duty, or a thing &s;it and proper that Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|tians
<PB N="187" REF="026594_0188_0FD07FDA01BAFE40">&s;hould be much in prayer for the re|vival of religion, and much more in it than they u&s;ed to be, without agreeing on parti|cular times, how liable would &s;uch a lax a|greement be to be &s;oon forgotten, and that extraordinary prayerfulne&s;s, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fixed to no certain times, to be totally neglected? To be &s;ure, di&s;tant parts of the church of Chri&s;t could have no confidence in one an|other, that this would not be the ca&s;e. If the&s;e mini&s;ters in Scotland, in&s;tead of the propo&s;al they have made, or any other mi|ni&s;ters or Chri&s;tians in any part of the Chri&s;|tian world, had &s;ent abroad only a general propo&s;al, that God's people &s;hould, for the time to come, be much more in prayer for the advancement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, than had been common among Chri&s;tians here|tofore; and they &s;hould hear their propo&s;al was generally allowed to be good, and that mini&s;ters and people, in one place and an|other, that had occa&s;ion to &s;peak their minds upon it, owned that it was a very proper thing, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould pray more for this mercy than they generally u&s;ed to do; could they, from this only, have, in any mea&s;ure, the like grounds of dependence, that God's people, in various parts of the
<PB N="188" REF="026594_0189_0FD07FDB8104D570">Chri&s;tian world, would, indeed, hencefor|ward act unitedly, in maintaining extraor|dinary prayer for this mercy, as if they &s;hould not only hear that the duty in general was approved of, but al&s;o that particular times were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ually fixed on for the purpo&s;e, and an agreement and joint re&s;olution was come into, that they would, unle&s;s extraordinari|ly hindered, &s;et apart &s;uch particular &s;ea&s;ons to be &s;pent in this duty, from time to time, maintaining this practice for a certain num|ber of year?</P>
<P N="2">2. For God's people, in di&s;tant places, to agree on certain times for extraordinary pray|er, wherein they will unitedly put up their reque&s;ts to God, is a means fit and proper to be u&s;ed, in order to the vi&s;ibility of their union in &s;uch prayer. Union among God's people in prayer is truly beautiful, as has been before ob&s;erved and &s;hewn; it is beau|tiful in the eyes of Chri&s;t, and it is ju&s;tly beautiful and amiable in the eyes of Chri&s;|tians. And if &s;o, then it mu&s;t needs be de|&s;irable to Chri&s;tians that &s;uch union &s;hould be vi&s;ible. If it would be a lovely &s;ight in the eyes of the church of Chri&s;t, and much to their comfort, to behold various and dif|ferent
<PB N="189" REF="026594_0190_0FD0B361A6880768">parts of the church united in extraor|dinary prayer for the general out-pouring of the Spirit, then it mu&s;t be de&s;irable to them that &s;uch an union &s;hould be vi&s;ible, that they may behold it; for if it be not vi|&s;ible, it cannot be beheld. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">reement and union in a multitude in their wor&s;hip becomes vi&s;ible, by an agreement in &s;ome external vi&s;ible circum&s;tances. Wor&s;hip it|&s;elf becomes vi&s;ible wor&s;hip, by &s;omething external and vi&s;ible belonging to the wor|&s;hip, and no other way; therefore union and agreement of many in wor&s;hip becomes vi|&s;ible no other way, but by union and agree|ment in the external and vi&s;ible acts and cir|cum&s;tances of the wor&s;hip. Such union and agreement becomes vi&s;ible, particularly by an agreement in tho&s;e two vi&s;ible circum|&s;tances, time and place. When a number of Chri&s;tians live near together, and their number and &s;ituation is convenient, and they have a de&s;ire vi&s;ibly to unite in any acts of wor&s;hip, they are wont to make their union and agreement vi&s;ible by an union in both the&s;e circum&s;tances. But when a much great|er number of Chri&s;tians, dwelling in di&s;tant places, &s;o that they cannot unite by wor&s;hip|ping in the &s;ame place, yet de&s;ire a vi&s;ible
<PB N="190" REF="026594_0191_0FD0B3632BF56718">union in &s;ome extraordinary wor&s;hip, they are wont to make their union and agree|ment vi&s;ible, by agreeing only in the former of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, viz. that of time; as is common in the appointment of public fa&s;ts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ank&s;givings; the &s;ame day is ap|pointed, for the performance of that extra|ordinary wor&s;hip, by all tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, in different places, that it is intended &s;hould be united therein, as a vi&s;ible note of their uni|on. This the common light and &s;en&s;e of God's people leads Chri&s;tians to in all coun|tries. And the wi&s;dom of God &s;eems to dic|tate the &s;ame thing, in appointing that his people, through the world, in all ages, in their &s;tated and ordinary public wor&s;hip, e|very week, &s;hould manife&s;t this union and communion one with another, in their wor|&s;hip, as one holy &s;ociety, and great congre|gation of wor&s;hippers, and &s;ervants of God, by offering up their wor&s;hip on the &s;ame day, for the greater glory of their common Lord, and the greater edification and com|fort of the whole body.</P>
<P>If any yet find fault with the propo&s;al of certain times to be agreed on by God's peo|ple in different places, in the manner &s;et forth in the memorial, I would a&s;k whether
<PB N="191" REF="026594_0192_0FD0B364C097BBC0">they object again&s;t any &s;uch thing, as a vi&s;i|ble agreement of God's people, in different parts of the world, in extraordinary prayer, for the comming of Chri&s;t's kingdom? Whe|ther &s;uch a thing, being vi&s;ible, would not be much for the public honor of Gods name? And whether it would not tend to Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;i&s;tance, quickening and encouragement in the duty united in, by mutual example, and al&s;o to their mutual comfort, by a manife&s;t|ation of that union which is amiable to Chri&s;t and Chri&s;tians, and to promote a Chri&s;tian union among profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians in gene|ral? And whether we have not rea&s;on to think, from the word of God, that before that great revival of religion foretold is ac|compli&s;hed, there will be a vi&s;ible union of the people of God, in various parts of the world, in extraordinary prayer, for this mer|cy? If the&s;e things are allowed, I would then a&s;k further, whether any method can be thought of or devi&s;ed, whereby an expre&s;s agreement, and vi&s;ible union of God's peo|ple, in different parts of the world, can be come into, and maintained, but this, or &s;ome other equivalent to it? If there be any ex|pre&s;s agreement about any extraordinary
<PB N="192" REF="026594_0193_0FD0B366347F1258">prayer at all, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be propo&s;ed by &s;ome, and others mu&s;t fall in, in the manner as is repre&s;ented in my text. And if extra|ordinary prayer be agreed on and maintain|ed by many in different places, vi&s;ibly one to another, then it mu&s;t be agreed in &s;ome re&s;pect, and with regard to &s;ome circum&s;tan|ces, what extraordinary prayer &s;hall be kept up; and it mu&s;t be &s;een and heard of, from one to another, what extraordinary prayer is kept up. But how &s;hall this be, when no times are agreed upon, and it is never known nor heard, by tho&s;e in different parts, nor is in any re&s;pect vi&s;ible to them, when, or how often, tho&s;e in one town or country, and an|other do attend this extraordinary prayer? The con&s;equence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that it can never be known how far, or in what re|&s;pect others join with them in extraordina|ry prayer, or whether they do it at all; and not &s;o much as one circum&s;tance of extra|ordinary prayer will be vi&s;ible; and indeed nothing will be vi&s;ible about it. So that I think any body that well con&s;iders the mat|ter, will &s;ee, that he who determines to op|po&s;e &s;uch a method as is propo&s;ed to us in the memorial, and all others equivalent to
<PB N="193" REF="026594_0194_0FD0B367A7A3C808">it is, in effect, determined to oppo&s;e there ever being any &s;uch thing at all, as an agreed and vi&s;ibly united extraordinary prayer, in the church of God, for a general out-pour|ing of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though it would not be rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that merely &s;uch a circum&s;tance of prayer, as many people's praying at the &s;ame time will directly have any influence or pre|valence with God, to cau&s;e him to be the more ready to hear prayer; yet &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have influence on the minds of men; as the con&s;ideration of it may tend to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e in praying, that are united in prayer. Will any deny, that it has any rea&s;onable tendency to encourage, animate, or in any re&s;pect to help the mind of a Chri&s;|tian in &s;erving God in any duty of religion, to join with a Chri&s;tian congregation, and to &s;ee an a&s;&s;embly of his dear brethren around him, at the &s;ame time engaged with him in the &s;ame duty? And &s;uppo&s;ing one in this a&s;&s;embly of &s;aints is blind, and &s;ees no one there, but has by other means ground of &s;atisfaction that there is pre&s;ent at that
<PB N="194" REF="026594_0195_0FD0B36926367880">time a multitude of God's people, that are united with him in the &s;ame &s;ervice, will any deny, that his &s;uppo&s;ing this, and being &s;atisfied of it, can have any rea&s;onable influ|ence upon his mind, to excite and encour|age him, or in any re&s;pect to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his wor&s;hip? The encouragement or help that one that joins with an a&s;&s;embly in wor|&s;hipping God, has in his wor&s;hip, by others being united with him, is not merely by any thing that he immediately perceives by &s;ight, or any other of the external &s;en&s;es (for uni|on in wor&s;hip is not a thing objected to the external &s;en&s;es;) but by the notice or know|ledge the mind has of that union, or the &s;a|tisfaction the under&s;tanding has that others, at that time, have their minds engaged with him in the &s;ame &s;ervice; which may be when tho&s;e unitedly engaged are at a di&s;tance one from another, as well as when they are pre|&s;ent. If one be pre&s;ent in a wor&s;hipping a&s;|&s;embly, and is not blind, and &s;ees others pre|&s;ent, and &s;ees their external behaviour, their union and engagedne&s;s with him in wor&s;hip is what he does not &s;ee, and what he &s;ees encourages and a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in his wor&s;hip, only as; he takes it as an evidence of that union and concurrence in his wor&s;hip, that
<PB N="195" REF="026594_0196_0FD0B36BA894FA20">is out of his &s;ight. And per&s;ons may have evidence of this concerning per&s;ons that are ab&s;ent, that may give him as much &s;atisfac|tion of their union with him, as if they were pre&s;ent. And therefore the con&s;ideration of others being at the &s;ame time engaged with him in wor&s;hip, that are ab&s;ent, may as rea&s;onably animate and encourage him in his wor&s;hip as if they were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There is no wi&s;dom in finding fault with human nature, as God has made it. Things that exi&s;t now, at this pre&s;ent time, are, in them&s;elves, no more weighty or important, than like things, and of equal reality, that exi&s;ted in time pa&s;t, or are to exi&s;t in time to come; yet it is evident, that the con&s;ider|ation of things being pre&s;ent (at lea&s;t in mo&s;t ca&s;es) does e&s;pecially affect human nature. As for in&s;tance, if a man &s;hould be certainly informed, that his dear child, at a di&s;tance, was now under &s;ome extreme &s;uffering, or that an ab&s;ent mo&s;t dear friend was at this time thinking of him, and in the exerci&s;e of great affection towards him, or in the per|formance of &s;ome great deed of friend&s;hip; or if a pious parent &s;hould know that now his child was in the act of &s;ome enormous wickedne&s;s; or that, on the contrary, he was
<PB N="196" REF="026594_0197_0FD0B36C8AE0DDC8">now in &s;ome eminent exerci&s;e of grace, and in the performance of an extraordinary deed of virtue and piety; would not tho&s;e things be more affecting to the human nature, for be|ing con&s;idered as things that are in exi&s;tence at the pre&s;ent time, than if con&s;idered as at &s;ome di&s;tance of time, either pa&s;t or future? Hundreds of other in&s;tances might be men|tioned wherein it is no le&s;s plain, that the con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent exi&s;tence of things gives them advantage to affect the minds of men. Yea, it is undoubtedly &s;o with things in general, that take any hold at all of our affections, and towards which we are not indifferent. And if the mind of a particular child of God is di&s;po&s;ed to be affected by the con&s;ideration of the religion of other &s;aints, and with their union and con|currence with him in any particular duty or act of religion, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why the human mind &s;hould not be more moved by the object of its affection, when con&s;idered as pre&s;ent, as well in this ca&s;e, as in any o|ther ca&s;e; yea, I think, we may on good grounds determine there is none.</P>
<P>Nor may we look upon it as an in&s;tance of the peculiar weakne&s;s of the human na|ture,
<PB N="197" REF="026594_0198_0FD0B36DB3D0E098">that men are more affected with things that are con&s;idered as pre&s;ent, than tho&s;e that are di&s;tant; but it &s;eems to be a thing com|mon to finite minds, and &s;o to all created in|telligent beings. Thus, the angels in heaven have peculiar joy, on occa&s;ion of the con|ver&s;ion of a &s;inner, when recent, beyond what they have in that which has been long pa&s;t. If any therefore &s;hall call it &s;illy and whim&s;ical in any, to value and regard &s;uch a circum&s;tance, in things of religion, as their exi&s;ting at the pre&s;ent time, &s;o as to be the more affected wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them for that, they mu&s;t call the ho&s;t of angels in heaven a parcel of &s;illy and whim&s;ical beings.</P>
<P>I remember, the Spectator (whom none will call a whim&s;ical author) &s;omewhere &s;peaking of different ways of dear friends mutually expre&s;&s;ing their affection, and maintaining a kind of intercour&s;e, in ab&s;ence one from an|other, mentions &s;uch an in&s;tance as this, with much approbation, viz. That two friends, that were greatly endeared one to another, when about to part, and to be for a con&s;i|derable time nece&s;&s;arily ab&s;ent, that they might have the comfort of the enjoyment of daily mutual expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, in their ab&s;ence, agreed that they would, eve|ry

And rather than mi&s;s this opportunity, they would &s;uddenly break off conver&s;ation, and abruptly leave the company they were engag|ed with.&mdash;If this be a de&s;irable way of inter|cour&s;e of particular friends, is it not a de&s;ir|able and amiable way of maintaining inter|cour&s;e and fellow&s;hip between brethren in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and the various members of the holy family of God, in different parts of the world, to come into an agreement, that they will &s;et apart certain times, which they will &s;pend with one accord, in extraordinary prayer to their heavenly Father, for the ad|vancement of the kingdom, and the glory of their common dear Lord and Saviour, and for each other's pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, and the greate&s;t good of all their fellow-creatures through the world?</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. Some perhaps may object, That it looks too much like Phari&s;ai&s;m, when per|&s;ons engage in any &s;uch extraordinary reli|gious exerci&s;es, beyond what is appointed by expre&s;s in&s;titution, for them thus de&s;ign|edly

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. All openly engaging in extraordi|nary exerci&s;es of religion, not expre&s;sly en|joined by in&s;titution, is not Phari&s;ai&s;m, nor has ever been &s;o reputed in the Chri&s;tian church. As when a particular church or congregation of Chri&s;tians agree together to keep a day of fa&s;ting and prayer, on &s;ome &s;pecial occa&s;ion; or when public days of fa&s;ting and thank&s;giving are kept, through|out a Chri&s;tian province or country; and though it be ordinarily the manner for the civil magi&s;trate to lead, in the &s;etting apart &s;uch days, yet that alters not the ca&s;e; if it be Phari&s;ai&s;m in the &s;ociety openly to agree in &s;uch extraordinary exerci&s;es of religion, it is not le&s;s Phari&s;ai&s;m for the heads of the &s;ociety leading in the affair. And if that were now the ca&s;e with the Chri&s;tian church, that once was, for about three hundred years together, that the civil magi&s;trate was not of the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, nor concerned him&s;elf in their affairs; yet this would not render it the le&s;s &s;uitable for Chri&s;tians, on proper occa&s;ions, jointly, and vi&s;ibly one to another, to engage in &s;uch extraordinary ex|erci&s;es
<PB N="200" REF="026594_0201_0FD0B372A3362900">of religion, and to keep days of fa&s;t|ing and thank&s;giving by agreement.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. As to the latter part of the objec|tion, there can be no room for it in this ca&s;e. It cannot be objected again&s;t what is propo&s;|ed in the memorial, that if per&s;ons &s;hould comply with it, it would look like affecting &s;ingularity, and open di&s;tinction from others of God's profe&s;&s;ing people, in extraordinary religion, &s;uch as was in the Phari&s;ees of old; becau&s;e it is evident, the very de&s;ign of the memorial, is not to promote &s;ingularity and di&s;tinction, but as much as po&s;&s;ible to avoid and prevent it. The end of the memorial is not to confine and limit the thing propo|&s;ed, that it may be practi&s;ed only by a few, in di&s;tinction from the generality; but on the contrary to extend it, and make it as gene|ral among profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians as po&s;&s;ible. Some had complied with the extraordinary duty propo&s;ed, and therein had been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from others, for two years, before the memorial was publi&s;hed; and they were more di&s;tingui&s;hed than they de&s;ired, and therefore &s;end abroad this memorial, that the practice might be more &s;pread, and be|come more general, that they might be le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed. What they evidently &s;eek, is
<PB N="201" REF="026594_0202_0FD0B373A97674C8">to bring to pa&s;s as general a compliance as po&s;&s;ible of Chri&s;tians of all denominations, <Q>intreating, that the de&s;ire of concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, contained in the memorial, may by no means be under&s;tood, as re&s;tric|ting to any particular denomination or party, or tho&s;e who are of &s;uch or &s;uch opinions about any former in&s;tances of re|markable religious concern; but to be ex|tended to all, who &s;hall vouch&s;afe any at|tention to the propo&s;al, and have at heart the intere&s;t of vital Chri&s;tianity, and the power of godline&s;s; and who, however dif|fering about other things, are convinced of the importance of fervent prayer, to promote that common intere&s;t, and of &s;cripture per&s;ua&s;ives, to promote &s;uch prayer.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. Another objection, that is very likely to ari&s;e in the minds of many again&s;t &s;uch extraordinary prayer as is propo&s;ed for the &s;peedy coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, is that we have no rea&s;on to expect it, until there fir&s;t come a time of mo&s;t extreme calamity to the church of God, and prevalence of her anti-chri&s;tian enemies again&s;t her; even that which is repre&s;ented, Rev. xi. by the &s;laying

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It is an opinion that &s;eems pretty much to have obtained, that before the ful|filment of the promi&s;es relating to the church's latter-day glory, there mu&s;t come a mo&s;t ter|rible time, a time of extreme &s;uffering, and dreadful per&s;ecution of the church of Chri&s;t, wherein Satan and Antichri&s;t are to obtain their greate&s;t victory over her, and &s;he is to be bro't lower than eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by her enemies. Which opinion has chiefly ri&s;en from the manner of interpreting and applying the fore-men|tioned prophecy of the &s;laying of the wit|ne&s;&s;es. This opinion, with &s;uch per&s;ons as retain it, mu&s;t needs be a great re&s;traint and hindrance, with regard to &s;uch an affair as is propo&s;ed to us in the memorial. If per|&s;ons expect no other, than that the more the glorious times of Chri&s;t's kingdom are ha&s;tened, the &s;ooner will come this dreadful time, wherein the generality of God's peo|ple mu&s;t &s;uffer &s;o extremely, and the church of Chri&s;t be almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, and blotted out from under heaven; how can it be o|therwi&s;e, than a great damp to their hope, courage and activity, in praying for and reaching after the &s;peedy introduction of
<PB N="203" REF="026594_0204_0FD0B376A5A57F38">tho&s;e glorious promi&s;ed times? As long as this opinion is retained, it will undoubtedly ever have this unhappy influence on the minds of tho&s;e that wi&s;h well to Zion, and favor her &s;tones and du&s;t. It will tend to damp, deaden, and keep down life, hope, and joyful expectation in prayer; and even in great mea&s;ure, to prevent all earne&s;t, ani|mated and encouraged prayer, in God's peo|ple, for this mercy, at any time before it is actually fulfilled. For they that proceed on this hypothe&s;is in their prayers, mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time that they pray for this glorious day, naturally conclude within them&s;elves, that they &s;hall never live to &s;ee on the earth any dawning of it, but only to &s;ee the di&s;|mal time that &s;hall precede it, in which the far greater part of God's people, that &s;hall live until then, &s;hall die under the extreme cruelties of their per&s;ecutors. And the more they expect that God will an&s;wer their pray|ers, by &s;peedy bringing on the promi&s;ed glorious day, the more mu&s;t they withal ex|pect them&s;elves to have a &s;hare in tho&s;e dreadful things, that nature &s;hrinks at the thoughts of, and al&s;o expect to &s;ee things that a renewed nature &s;hrinks at and dreads; even the prevailing of God's enemies, and
<PB N="204" REF="026594_0205_0FD0B3784E136C90">the almo&s;t total extingui&s;hing the true reli|gion in the world. And on this hypothe&s;is, the&s;e di&s;couragements are like to attend the prayers of God's people, until that di&s;mal time be actually come; and when that is come, tho&s;e that had been prophe&s;ying and praying in &s;ackcloth, &s;hall generally be &s;lain; and after that time is over, then the glorious day &s;hall immediately commence. So that this notion tends to di&s;courage and hinder all earne&s;t prayer in the church of God for that glorious coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, until it be actually come; and that is to hin|der its ever being at all.</P>
<P>It being &s;o, this opinion being of &s;uch hurtful tendency, certainly it is a thou&s;and pities it &s;hould prevail and be retained, if truly there be no good ground for it.</P>
<P>Therefore in an&s;wer to this objection, I would, with all humility and mode&s;ty, ex|amine the foundation of that opinion, of &s;uch a dreadful time of victory of Antichri&s;t over the church, yet to be expected: and particularly &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew that the <HI>&s;taying of the witne&s;&s;es,</HI> foretold, Rev. xi. 7&mdash;10. is not an event that remains yet to be fulfilled.&mdash;To this end, I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;e the following things to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="205" REF="026594_0206_0FD0B379A6858AB0">
1. The time wherein the <HI>witne&s;&s;es he dead in the &s;treets of the great city,</HI> doubtle&s;s, &s;ig|nifies the time wherein the true church of Chri&s;t is lowe&s;t of all, mo&s;t of all prevailed again&s;t by Antichri&s;t, and neare&s;t to an ut|ter extinction; the time wherein there is left the lea&s;t vi&s;ibility of the church of Chri&s;t yet &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the world, lea&s;t remains of any thing appertaining to true religion, whence a revival of it can be expected, and wherein all means of it are mo&s;t aboli&s;hed, and the &s;tate of the church is, in all re&s;pects, furthe&s;t from any thing whence any hopes of its ever flouri&s;hing again might ari&s;e. For before this the witne&s;&s;es <HI>prophe&s;y in &s;ackcloth.</HI> but now they are <HI>dead;</HI> before this they were kept low indeed, yet there was life, and pow|er to bring plagues on their enemies, and &s;o much of true religion le&s;t, as to be a contin|ual eye-&s;ore and torment to them; but now their enemies rejoice and fea&s;t, and have a general public triumph, as having obtained a full victory over them, and having entire|ly extirpated them, and being completely delivered from them, and all that might give them any fear of being troubled with them any more. This time, wherever it be fixed, doubtle&s;s, it the time, not only wherein fewe&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="026594_0207_0FD0B37B3838BB10">profe&s;&s;ors of the true religion are left in the world, but a time wherein the truth &s;hall be farthe&s;t out of &s;ight, and out of reach, and mo&s;t forgotten; wherein there are left few|e&s;t beams of light, or traces of truth, fewe&s;t means of information, and opportunities of coming to the knowledge of the truth; and &s;o a time of the mo&s;t barbarous ignorance, mo&s;t de&s;titute of all hi&s;tory, reliques, monu|ments and memory of things appertaining to true religion, or things, the knowledge of which hath any tendency to bring truth a|gain to light, and mo&s;t de&s;titute of learning, &s;tudy and enquiry.</P>
<P>Now, if we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, it is credible that a time will yet come in the world, that in the&s;e re&s;pects ex|ceeds all times that were before the Refor|mation?

It is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a change &s;hould be brought about in &s;o &s;hort a time&mdash;it cannot be without a miracle. In order to it, not only mu&s;t the Popi&s;h nations &s;o prevail, as utterly to extirpate the Prote&s;tant religion through the earth, but mu&s;t do many other
<PB N="207" REF="026594_0208_0FD0B37CA74D18A0">things, far more impo&s;&s;ible for them to effect, in order to cover the world with &s;o gro&s;s and confirmed a darkne&s;s, and to bury all light and truth in &s;o deep an oblivion, and &s;o far out of all means and hopes of a revi|val. And not only mu&s;t a va&s;t change be made in the Prote&s;tant world, but the Popi&s;h nations mu&s;t be &s;trangely metamorpho&s;ed, and they them&s;elves mu&s;t be terribly per&s;e|cuted by &s;ome other power, in order to bring them to &s;uch a change; nor would per&s;e|cution without extirpation be &s;ufficient for it.

<P N="2">2. In the Reformation, that was in the days of Luther, Calvin, and others their contemporaries, the threatened de&s;truction of Antichri&s;t, that dreadful enemy that had long oppre&s;&s;ed and worn out the &s;aints, was begun; nor was it a &s;mall beginning, but Antichri&s;t hath fallen, at lea&s;t, halfway to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e ground, from that height of power and
<PB N="208" REF="026594_0209_0FD0B37E2E60B228">grandeur, that he was in before. Then be|gan the vials of God's wrath to be <HI>poured out on the throne of the bea&s;t,</HI> to the great &s;haking of its foundations, and diminution of its extent; &s;o that the Pope lo&s;t near half of his former dominions, and as to degree of authority and influence over what is left, he is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what he had before. God now at length, in an&s;wer to the long contin|ued cries of his people, awaked as one out of &s;leep, and began to deliver his church from her exceeding low &s;tate, the &s;he had continued in for many ages, under the great oppre&s;&s;ion of this grand enemy, and to re|&s;tore her from her exile and bondage in the &s;piritual Babylon and Egypt. And it is not agreeable to the analogy of God's di&s;pen&s;a|tions, that after this, God &s;hould de&s;ert his people, and hide him&s;elf from them, even more than before, and leave them more than ever in the hands of their enemy, and all this advantage of the church again&s;t An|tichri&s;t &s;hould be entirely given up and lo&s;t, and the power and tyranny of Antichri&s;t be more confirmed, and the church brought more under, and more entirely &s;ubdued than ever before, and further from all help and means to recover. This is not God's way
<PB N="209" REF="026594_0210_0FD0B37FB904A248">of dealing with his people, or with their e|nemies; his work of &s;alvation is perfect&mdash; when he has begun &s;uch a work he will car|ry it on&mdash;when he once cau&s;es the day of deliverance to dawn to his people, after &s;uch a long night of di&s;mal darkne&s;s, he will not extingui&s;h the light, and cau&s;e them to re|turn again to midnight darkne&s;s&mdash;when he has begun to enkindle the ble&s;&s;ed fire, he will not quench the &s;moaking flax, until he had brought forth judgment unto victory. When once the church, after her long la|bour and &s;ore travail, has brought forth her man-child, and wrought &s;ome deliverance, her enemies &s;hall never be able to de&s;troy this child, though an infant, but it &s;hall a&s;|cend up to heaven, and be &s;et on high out of their reach.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction that God often foretold and threatened to ancient Babylon (which is often referred to in the Revelation, as a great type of the anti-chri&s;tian church) was gradually accompli&s;hed, and fulfilled by va|rious &s;teps, at a great di&s;tance of time one from another; it was begun in the conque&s;t of Cyrus, and was further accompli&s;hed by Darius, about eighteen years after, by a yet
<PB N="210" REF="026594_0211_0FD0B38150623AA8">greater de&s;truction, wherein it was brought much nearer to utter de&s;olation; but it was about two hundred and twenty-three years after this, before the ruin of it was perfect|ed, and the prophecies again&s;t it fully ac|compli&s;hed, in its being made an utter and perpetual de&s;olation, without any human in|habitant, becoming the dwelling-place for owls, dragons, and other doleful creatures. But yet when God had once begun to de|&s;troy her, he went on until he fini&s;hed, and never &s;uffered her any more to recover and e&s;tabli&s;h her former empire. So the re&s;ti|tution of the Jewi&s;h church, after the Baby|loni&s;h captivity, was gradual, by various &s;teps; there were &s;everal times of return of the Jews from captivity, and &s;everal di&s;tinct decrees of the Per&s;ian emperors, for the re|&s;toring and rebuilding Jeru&s;alem, and re|e&s;tabli&s;hing the Jewi&s;h church and &s;tate; and it was done in turbulent times, there were great interruptions and checks, and violent oppo&s;itions, and times wherein the enemy did much prevail: But yet, when God had once begun the work he al&s;o made an end; he never &s;uffered the enemies of the Jews to bring Jeru&s;alem to &s;uch a &s;tate of de&s;olation as it had been in before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntil
<PB N="211" REF="026594_0212_0FD0B382B4CFE5C0">the promi&s;ed re&s;toration was complete. A|gain, the deliverance of God's church from the oppre&s;&s;ion of Antiochus Epiphanes, (a|nother known type of Antichri&s;t) was gra|dual; they were fir&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted in a &s;mall de|gree, by the Maccabees, and afterwards the promi&s;ed deliverance was completed, in the recovery of Jeru&s;alem, the re&s;toration of the temple, the mi&s;erable end of Antiochus, and the con&s;equent more full deliverance of the whole land. But after God once began to appear for the help of his church in that in|&s;tance, after it &s;eemed dead and pa&s;t all hope, he never &s;uffered Antiochus to prevail a|gain&s;t his people, to that degree, again; though the utmo&s;t &s;trength of this great mo|narch was u&s;ed, from time to time, in order to it, and his va&s;t empire was engaged again&s;t an handful that oppo&s;ed them: God never for&s;ook the work of his own hands; when he had begun to deliver his people, he al&s;o made an end. And &s;o Haman, that proud and inveterate enemy of the Jews, that tho't to extirpate the whole nation, who al&s;o was probably another type of Antichri&s;t, when he began to fall before E&s;ther and Mordecai, never &s;tayed, until his ruin, and the church's deliverance was complete.

Which was remarkably the ca&s;e, in the dark times of Popery; but &s;ince the Reformation the num|ber of tho&s;e appearing on the &s;ide of true religion, has been far from being &s;o &s;mall. &mdash;The vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t has been va&s;tly large, in compari&s;on of what it was before; the number of Prote&s;tants has &s;ome|times been thought nearly equal to that of the Papi&s;ts; and, doubtle&s;s, the number of true &s;aints has been far greater than before.</P>

That the twelve hundred and &s;ixty days is the proper time of the church's trouble and bondage, or being cloathed in &s;ackcloth, becau&s;e it is the appointed time of the reign of Antichri&s;t. But this does not hinder but that God, out of his great com|pa&s;&s;ion to his church, &s;hould, in &s;ome re&s;pect, &s;horten the days, and grant that &s;he &s;hould, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, anticipate the appointed great deliverance that &s;hould be at the end of tho&s;e days; as he has, in fact, done in the Re&s;ormation, whereby the church has had a great degree of re&s;toration granted, from the darkne&s;s and power of Antichri&s;t, before her proper time of re&s;toration, which is at the end of the twelve hundred and &s;ixty days. Thus the church of Chri&s;t, through the ten|der mercies of her Father and Redeemer, in
<PB N="235" REF="026594_0236_0FD0B3A6A77A0888">&s;ome re&s;pects, anticipates her deliverance from her &s;orrows and &s;ackcloth; as many parts of the church are hereby brought from under the dominion of the anti-chri&s;tian pow|ers, into a &s;tate of power and liberty, though, in other re&s;pects, the church may be &s;aid to continue in &s;ackcloth, and in the wilderne&s;s, until the end of the days; many parts of it &s;till remaining under grievous per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>What we rende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>When they &s;hall have fi|ni&s;hed their te&s;timony,</HI> Mr. Lowman, from Mr. Daubuz, renders, <HI>While they &s;hall perform their te&s;timony;</HI> and ob&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, that the original may mean the time of their te&s;timony, as well as the end of it.</P>
<P>I might here ob&s;erve, that we have other in&s;tances of God's &s;hortening the days of his church's captivity and bondage, either at the beginning or end, very parallel with what has been now &s;uppo&s;ed in the ca&s;e of the wit|ne&s;&s;es. Thus the proper time of the bondage of the po&s;terity of Abraham in Egypt, was four hundred years, Gen. xv. 13. But yet God in mercy deferred the beginning of their bondage, whereby the time was much &s;hort|ened at the beginning. So the time where|in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was foretold, that the <HI>whole land of I&s;|rael
<PB N="236" REF="026594_0237_0FD0B3A827E034C8">&s;hould be a de&s;olation and an a&s;toni&s;hment, and the land &s;hould enjoy her &s;abbaths,</HI> by the Babyloni&s;h captivity, was &s;eventy years, Jer. xxv. 11, 12. and the&s;e &s;eventy years are dat|ed in 2d Chro. xxxvi. 20, 21. from Zede|kiah's captivity; and yet, from that captivi|ty to Cyrus's decree, was but fifty-two years; though it was indeed &s;eventy years before the more full re&s;toration of the Jewi&s;h church and &s;late by Darius's decree, Ezra vi. So the proper time of the oppre&s;&s;ion and bondage of the Jewi&s;h church under Antiochus Epi|phanes, wherein <HI>both the &s;anctuary and ho&s;t &s;hould be trodden under foot by him, was two thou&s;and three hundred days,</HI> Dan. viii. 13, 14. The time from Antiochus's taking Je|ru&s;alem, and polluting the &s;anctuary, to An|tiochus's death, &s;eems to have been about &s;o long; but God &s;hortened the days, by grant|ing remarkable help to his people by means of the Maccabees, before that time; yea, the temple and &s;anctuary were re&s;lored, and the altar rebuilt and dedicated before that time.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think there appears to be no rea&s;on from the prophecy concerning the two witne&s;&s;es, Rev. xi. to expect any &s;uch general and terrible de&s;truction of the church of Chri&s;t, before the utter downfal of
<PB N="237" REF="026594_0238_0FD0B3A9B7F3EDC8">Antichri&s;t, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, but good rea&s;on to determine the contrary. It is true, there is abundant evidence in &s;cripture, that there is yet remaining a mighty conflict be|tween the church and her enemies, the mo&s;t violent &s;truggle of Satan and his adherents, in oppo&s;ition to true religion, and the mo&s;t general commotion that ever was in the world, &s;ince the foundation of it to that time; and many particular Chri&s;tians, and &s;ome parts of the church of Chri&s;t, may &s;uffer hard things in this conflict; but, in the general, Satan and Antichri&s;t &s;hall not get the vic|tory, nor greatly prevail, but, on the con|trary, be entirely conquered, and utterly o|verthrown, in this great battle. So that I hope this prophecy of the &s;laying of the wit|ne&s;&s;es will not &s;tand in the way of a com|pliance with the propo&s;al made to us in the memorial, as a prevalent objection and di&s;|couragement.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. A late very learned and ingeni|ous Expo&s;itor of the Revelation, viz. Mr. Lowman, &s;ets the fall of Antichri&s;t, and con|&s;equently the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, at a great di&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;ing that the twelve hundred and &s;ixty years of Antichri&s;t's reign did not begin till the year &s;even hundred
<PB N="238" REF="026594_0239_0FD0B3AB26F08D38">and fifty-fix; and con&s;equently, that it will not end until after the year two thou&s;and, more than two hundred and fifty years hence, and this opinion he confirms by a great va|riety of arguments.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. If this objection be allowed to be valid, and that which ought to determine per&s;ons in an affair of this nature, and tho&s;e things concerning God's people praying for this glorious event, be al&s;o allowed to be true, which before were &s;hewn to be the will of God abundantly revealed in his word, then the following things mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, viz. That it is the will of God that his peo|ple be much in prayer for this event, and particularly that it is God's revealed will and purpo&s;e, that, a little before the accom|pli&s;hment of it, his people be earne&s;tly &s;eek|ing and waiting, and importunately and in|ce&s;&s;antly crying to God for it; but yet that it was God's de&s;ign, that before this time comes of extraordinary prayer and impor|tunity of his church, for the bringing on this glorious event, his church &s;hould have it giv|en them to under&s;tand preci&s;ely when the appointed time &s;hould be, and that accord|ingly he has now actually brought the fixed time to light by means of Mr. Lowman.&mdash;
<PB N="239" REF="026594_0240_0FD0B3ACB80C9E18">But is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that this &s;hould be God's manner of dealing with his church, fir&s;t to make known to them the preci&s;e time which he has unalterably &s;ixed for the &s;hew|ing this mercy to Zion, and then make it the duty of his church, in an extraordinary manner, to be, by prayer, enquiring of him concerning it, and &s;aying&mdash;<HI>How long, Lord!</HI> and waiting for it, day and night, crying to him, with exceeding importunity, that he would bring it on, that he would come quick|ly, that he would hide him&s;elf no longer, but would ari&s;e and have mercy upon Zion, and awake as one out of &s;leep, openly ma|ni&s;e&s;t him&s;elf, and make bare his holy arm for the &s;alvation of his people? That <HI>they that make mention of the Lord &s;hould not keep &s;ilence, nor give him any re&s;t, until he e&s;tabli&s;h and make Jeru&s;alem a prai&s;e on the earth?</HI> And that the church &s;hould then &s;ay to Chri&s;t, <HI>Make ha&s;te, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart on the mountain of &s;pices?</HI></P>
<P>It may be many ways for the comfort and bene&s;it of God's church in her afflicted &s;tate, to know that the reign of Antichri&s;t is to be no more than one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years; and &s;ome things in general
<PB N="240" REF="026594_0241_0FD0B3AE27AC4FA0">may be argued concerning the approach of it, when it is near; as the Jews could argue the approach of Chri&s;t's fir&s;t coming, from Daniel's prophecy of the &s;eventy weeks, though they knew not preci&s;ely when that &s;eventy weeks would end. But it is not rea|&s;onable to expect that God &s;hould make known to us beforehand, the preci&s;e time of Chri&s;t's coming in his kingdom. The di&s;|ciples de&s;ired to know this, and manife&s;ted their de&s;ire to their Lord, but he told them plainly, that <HI>it was not for them to know the times and &s;ea&s;ons, which the Father hath put in his own power,</HI> Acts i. 6, 7. and there is no rea&s;on to think that it is any more for us than for them, or for Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples in the&s;e days, any more than for his apo&s;tles in tho&s;e days. God makes it the duty of his church to be importunately praying for it, and praying that it may come &s;peedily; and not only to be praying for it, but to be &s;eek|ing for it, in the u&s;e of proper means, en|deavouring that religion may now revive e|very where, and Satan's kingdom be over|thrown; and always to be waiting for it, be|ing in a con&s;tant preparation for it, as &s;er|vants that wait for the coming of their lord, or virgins for the coming of the bridegroom,
<PB N="241" REF="026594_0242_0FD0B3AFA87354D8">not knowing at what hour he will come.&mdash; But God's making known beforehand the preci&s;e time of his coming, does not well con&s;i&s;t with the&s;e things.</P>
<P>It is the revealed will of God, that he &s;hould be enquired of by his people, by ex|traordinary prayer, concerning this great mercy, to do it for them, before it be fulfill|ed. And if any &s;uppo&s;e, that it is now found out preci&s;ely when the time is to be, and (the time being at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance) that now is not a proper &s;ea&s;on to begin this extraordinary prayer, I would, on this &s;up|po&s;ition, a&s;k&mdash;When we &s;hall begin?

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. I acknowledge that Mr. Lowman's Expo&s;ition of the Revelation is, on many ac|counts, excellently written, giving great light
<PB N="242" REF="026594_0243_0FD0B3B134226B98">into &s;ome parts of that prophecy, and an in|&s;tance of the ful&s;illment of that prediction, Dan. xii. 4. <HI>Many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed;</HI> and e&s;pecially in his Interpretation of the Five Fir&s;t Vials, (which he &s;uppo&s;eth already poured out) ex|ceedingly &s;atisfying. But yet the opinion of Mr. Lowman, with regard to the particular time of the beginning and end of the time, times, and an half of Antichri&s;t's reign, and of all others that pretend to &s;ix the time, is the lea&s;t to be regarded, becau&s;e it is clearly revealed, and expre&s;sly declared by God, that that matter &s;hall be &s;ealed up and hid, and not known until the time of the end of this time, times, and an half. Daniel, in the la&s;t chapter of his prophecy, gives us an ac|count, how the angel told him of a future time of great trouble and affliction to the church of God, and then &s;aid to him, ver. 4. <HI>But thou, O Daniel,</HI> SHUT UP THE WORDS, AND SEAL THE BOOK, EVEN TO THE TIME OF THE END. And then the prophet pro|ceeds to give an account of a vi&s;ion that he had of one earne&s;lly enquiring of the angel of the Lord <HI>how long it would be to the end</HI> of this remarkable and wonderful time of the church's trouble, &s;aying. <HI>How long &s;hall
<PB N="243" REF="026594_0244_0FD0B3B2AC52DCE0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t be to the end of the&s;e wonders?</HI> ver. 5, 6. The an&s;wer was, that <HI>it &s;hould be for a time, times, and an half,</HI> and that when &s;o long a time was pa&s;t, then this wonderful affliction and &s;cattering of the holy people &s;hould be fini&s;hed, ver. 7. But then Daniel tells us, in the next ver&s;e, that <HI>he heard, but he under|&s;tood not,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>O, my Lord, what &s;hall be the end of the&s;e things?</HI> He did not under|&s;tand that general and my&s;tical an&s;wer, that tho&s;e things &s;hould have an end at the end of a time, times, and an half; he did not know by it, when this period would have an end; and therefore he enquires more parti|cularly what the time of the end was. But the angel replies, ver. 9. <HI>Go thy way, Daniel, the words are clo&s;ed and &s;ealed up, until the time of the end.</HI> I do not know what could have been more expre&s;s. The angel gently rebukes this over inqui&s;itivene&s;s of Daniel, very much as Chri&s;t did a like inqui&s;itivene&s;s of the di&s;ciples concerning the &s;ame matter, when he &s;aid to them&mdash;<HI>It is not for you to know the times and &s;ea&s;ons, that the Father hath put in his own power.</HI>&mdash;I think there can be no doubt but that this &s;pace, of a time, times, and an half of the church's great trou|ble, about the end of which Daniel enquires,
<PB N="244" REF="026594_0245_0FD0B3B425987B30">is the &s;ame with that time, times, and half, that is &s;poken of, chap. vii. 25. and Rev. xii. 14. as the time of Antichri&s;t's reign, and the church's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the wilderne&s;s, and not merely the time of the church's troubles by Antiochus Epiphanes. But we &s;ee, when Daniel has a mind to know particularly when this time would come to an end, he is bid to go away, and re&s;t contented in igno|rance of this matter; for, &s;ays the man cloath|ed in linen, THE WORDS ARE CLOSED UP, AND SEALED, UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END. That is, very plainly, the matter that you enquire about, when the end of this time, and times, and half &s;hall come, &s;hall not be known, but be kept a great &s;ecret, until the time of the end actually comes, and all attempts to find it out before that &s;hall be in vain. And therefore when a particular divine ap|pears, that thinks he has found it out, and has un&s;ealed this matter, and made it ma|nife&s;t with very manifold and abundant e|vidence, we may well think he is mi&s;taken, and doubt whether tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed eviden|ces are truly &s;olid ones, and &s;uch as are in|deed &s;ufficient to make that matter manife&s;t, which God has declared &s;hould be kept hid, and not made manife&s;t before it is accom|pli&s;hed.
<PB N="245" REF="026594_0246_0FD0B3B5B130F0F8">Mr. Lowman's own words in his preface, p. 24, 25. are here worthy to be re|peated: <Q>It will (&s;ays he) ever be a point of wi&s;dom, not to be over bu&s;y, or over confident in any thing, e&s;pecially in fix|ing periods of time, or determining &s;ea|&s;ons, which it may be are not to be deter|mined, it may be are not fit to be known. It is a maxim, of greater wi&s;dom than is u&s;ually thought, <HI>Seek not to know what &s;hould not be revealed.</HI> Such are many future events. The preci&s;e time of our Sa|viour's coming to judgment, was not re|vealed, becau&s;e not fit to be revealed.&mdash; The uncertainty of his appearance was of greater &s;ervice to pre&s;erve a care of reli|gion, than the revelation of it would have been; for the uncertainty it&s;elf gives many u&s;eful exhortations&mdash;<HI>Watch, for ye know not what hour the Son of Man cometh.</HI> Sup|po&s;e then &s;ome of the events de&s;cribed in this prophecy &s;hould be of doubtful ap|plication; &s;uppo&s;e the preci&s;e time of the downfall of the bea&s;t, the &s;laying and re|&s;urrection of the witne&s;&s;es, and the begin|ning of the thou&s;and years happy &s;tate of the church, &s;hould not be &s;o determined, but it would admit of different calcula|tions;
<PB N="246" REF="026594_0247_0FD0B3B72596C5B0">may it not be wi&s;e, and therefore fit, it &s;hould be &s;o? The certainty of tho&s;e events in a proper time, though that time &s;hould not be preci&s;ely determined, will an&s;wer the greater ends of u&s;eful in&s;truc|tion. And if the revelation &s;hould go no farther than this, it would yet be a revela|tion, of great benefit and advantage, as the certainty of the day of judgment in its pro|per time &s;urely is, though of that day and hour knoweth no man.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. Though it is not for us to know the preci&s;e time of the fall of Antichri&s;t, yet I humbly conceive that we have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the event principally intended, in the prophecies, of Antichri&s;t's de&s;truction, to be at &s;o great a di&s;tance, as Mr. Lowman places it, but have rea&s;on to think it to be much nearer. Not that I would &s;et up my|&s;elf as a per&s;on of equal judgment with Mr. Lowman in matters of this nature. As he differs from mo&s;t others of the mo&s;t approv|ed expo&s;itors of the Apocalyp&s;e, in this mat|ter, &s;o I hope it will not appear vanity and pre&s;umption in me, to differ from this par|ticular expo&s;itor, and to agree with the great|er number. And &s;ince his opinion &s;tands &s;o much in the, way of that great and import|ant
<PB N="247" REF="026594_0248_0FD0B3B8B40E3F88">affair, to promote which is the very end of this whole di&s;cour&s;e, I hope it will not look as though I affected to appear con&s;i|derably among the interpreters of prophecy, and as a per&s;on of &s;kill in the&s;e my&s;terious matters, that I offer &s;ome rea&s;ons again&s;t Mr. Lowman's opinions. It is &s;urely a great pity, that it &s;hould be received as a thing clear and abundantly confirmed, that the glorious day of Antichri&s;t's fall is at &s;o great a di&s;|tance, (&s;o directly tending to damp and di&s;|courage all earne&s;t prayers for, or endea|vours after its &s;peedy accompli&s;hment) un|le&s;s there be good and plain ground for it. I would therefore offer &s;ome things to con&s;i|deration, which, I think, may ju&s;tly make us look upon the opinion of this learned in|terpreter, of this happy event's being at &s;o great a di&s;tance, not &s;o certain and indubi|table, as to hinder our praying and hoping for its being fulfilled much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The period of Antichri&s;t's reign, as this author has &s;ixed it, &s;eems to be the main point in&s;i&s;ted on in his Expo&s;ition of the Re|velation, which he &s;uppo&s;es a great many things in the &s;cheme of prophecies deliver|ed in that book do concur to e&s;tabli&s;h. And, indeed, it is &s;o, with re&s;pect to the &s;cheme
<PB N="248" REF="026594_0249_0FD0B3BA35820750">of interpretation of the&s;e prophecies, which he goes into, and finds it requi&s;ite to main|tain, in order to confirm this point. But there are &s;everal things in that &s;cheme, that appear to me ju&s;tly liable to exception.</P>
<P>Whereas it is repre&s;ented, Rev. xvii. 10, 11. that there are &s;even different &s;ucce&s;&s;ive heads of the bea&s;t; that five were pa&s;t, and another was to come, and to continue a &s;hort &s;pace, that might, on &s;ome accounts, be reckoned a &s;eventh; and that Antichri&s;t was to follow next after this, as the eighth; but yet the foregoing not being properly one of the heads of the bea&s;t, he was properly the &s;eventh. Mr. Lowman does not think with others, that by the &s;eventh that was to continue a &s;hort &s;pace, which would not be properly one of the heads of the bea&s;t, is meant Con&s;tantine, and the other Chri&s;tian emperors; (for he thinks they are reckoned as properly belonging to the &s;ixth head of the bea&s;t) but that hereby is intended the government that Rome was &s;ubject to un|der the Gothic princes, and the exarchate of Ravenna, after the imperial form of go|vernment in Rome cea&s;ed in Augu&s;tulus, until the Pope was inve&s;ted with his tempo|ral dominion, called St. Peter's Patrimony,

But it &s;eems to me to be very unlikely, that the Spirit of God &s;hould reckon Con&s;tantime and the Chri&s;tian emperors as proper members, and belonging to one of the heads, of that mon|&s;trous wild and cruel bea&s;t, that is compar|ed to a leopard and a bear, and a devouring lion, and that had a mouth &s;peaking great things and bla&s;phemies, and that rules by the power and authority of the dragon, or the devil;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>Therion</HI> &s;igni&s;ies a wild &s;avage bea&s;t, as Mr. Low|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n him&s;elf ob&s;erves, page 127.</NOTE> which bea&s;t is repre&s;ented in this 17th chapter, as full of names of bla&s;|phemy, and of a bloody colour, denoting his exceeding cruelty in perfecuting the Chri&s;|tian church.

As among the tribes that were &s;ealed, Rev. viii. tho&s;e idolatrous tribes of Ephraim and Dan are left out, and in the genealogy of Chri&s;t, Matth. i. tho&s;e princes that were chiefly noted for idolatry, are left out. Much more would God be careful not to reckon his own people, e&s;pecially &s;uch Chri&s;tian princes as have been the mo&s;t e|minent in&s;truments of overthrowing idola|try, among&s;t idolaters, and as members and

It was therefore worthy of God, agreeable to his manner, and what might well be expect|ed, that when he was reckoning up the &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ive heads of this bea&s;t, and Con|&s;tantine and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors came in the way, and there was occa&s;ion to mention them, to &s;et a mark, or note of di&s;tinction on them, &s;ignifying that they did not properly belong to the bea&s;t, nor were to be reckoned as be|longing to the heads, and therefore are to be &s;kipped over in the reckoning, and Anti|chri&s;t, though the eighth head of the Roman empire, is to be reckoned the &s;eventh head of the bea&s;t. This appears to me abundant|ly the mo&s;t ju&s;t and natural interpretation of Rev. xvii. 10, 11. It is rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that God would take care to make &s;uch a note in this prophetical de&s;cription
<PB N="252" REF="026594_0253_0FD0B3C0256FB1C8">of this dreadful bea&s;t, and not, by any means to reckon Con&s;tantine as belonging properly to him.&mdash;If we reckon Con&s;tantine as a mem|ber of this bea&s;t having &s;even heads and ten horns, de&s;cribed chap. xvii. and as properly one of his heads, then he was al&s;o properly a member of the great red dragon with &s;e|ven heads and ten horns that warred with the woman, chap. xii. For the &s;even heads and ten borns of that dragon, are plainly the &s;ame with the &s;even heads and ten horns of the bea&s;t. So that this makes Con&s;tantine a vi&s;ible member of the devil; for we are told expre&s;sly of that dragon, ver 9. that he was <HI>that old &s;erpent, called the Devil and Sa|tan.</HI> And to &s;uppo&s;e that Con&s;tantine is reckoned as belonging to one of the heads of that dragon, is to make the&s;e prophecies incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves. For herein this 12th chapter, we have repre&s;ented a war be|tween the dragon and the woman cloathed with the &s;un; which woman, as all agree, is the church; but Con&s;tantine, as all do al&s;o agree, belonged to the woman, was a mem|ber of the Chri&s;tian church, and was on that &s;ide in the war again&s;t the dragon; yea, was the main in&s;trument of that great victory that was obtained over the dragon there &s;po|ken
<PB N="253" REF="026594_0254_0FD0B3C1A567B2E8">of, ver. 9&mdash;12. What an incon&s;i&s;tency therefore is it, to &s;uppo&s;e that he was at the &s;ame time a member and head of that very dragon, which fought with the woman, and yet which Con&s;tantine him&s;elf fought with, overcame, and gloriou&s;ly triumphed over! It is not therefore to be wondered at, that God was careful to di&s;tingui&s;h Con&s;tantine from the proper heads of the bea&s;t; it would have been a wonder if he had not. God &s;eems to have been careful to di&s;tingui&s;h him, not only in his word, but in his providence, by &s;o ordering it that this Chri&s;tian emperor &s;hould be removed from Rome, the city that God had given up to be the &s;eat of the pow|er of the bea&s;t, and of its heads, and that he &s;hould have the &s;eat of his empire el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine was made the in&s;trument of giving a mortal wound to the heathen Roman empire, and giving it a mortal wound in its head, viz. the heathen emperors that were then reigning, Maxentius and Licinius.&mdash; But more eminently was this glorious change in the empire owing to the power of God's word, the prevalence of the glorious go&s;pel, by which Con&s;tantine him&s;elf was convert|ed, and &s;o became the in&s;trument of the o|verthrow
<PB N="254" REF="026594_0255_0FD0B3C327113C68">of the heathen empire in the ea&s;t and we&s;t. The change that was then bro't to pa&s;s, is repre&s;ented as the de&s;truction of the heathen empire, or the old heathen world, and therefore &s;eems to be compared to that di&s;&s;olution of heaven and earth that &s;hall be at the day of judgment, Rev. vi. 12. to the end. And therefore well might the heathen empire, under the head which was then reign|ing, be repre&s;ented as wounded to death, chap. xiii. 3. It is much more likely, that the wound the bea&s;t had by a &s;word, in his head, &s;poken of ver. 14. was the wound that the heathen empire had in its head, by that &s;word which we read of, chap. i. 16. and xix. 15. that proceeds out of the mouth of Chri&s;t, than the wound that was given to the Chri&s;tian empire and emperor by the &s;word of the heathen Goths. It is mo&s;t likely that this deadly wound was by that &s;word with which Michael made war with him, and o|vercame him, and ca&s;t him to the earth, chap. xii. 9. and that the deadly wound which was given him, was given him at that very time. It is mo&s;t likely, that the &s;word that gave him this deadly wound, after which he &s;trangely revived as though he ro&s;e from the dead, was the &s;ame &s;word with that which is &s;poken of,
<PB N="255" REF="026594_0256_0FD0B3C4D53E2410">as what &s;hall at la&s;t utterly de&s;troy him, &s;o that he &s;hall never ri&s;e more, chap. xix. 15, 19, 20, 21. This wounding of the head of the bea&s;t by the de&s;truction of the heathen em|pire, and conver&s;ion of the emperor to the Chri&s;tian truth, was a glorious event indeed of Divine Providence, worthy to be &s;o much &s;poken of in prophecy. It is natural to &s;up|po&s;e, that the mortal wounding of the head of that &s;avage cruel bea&s;t, that is repre&s;ent|ed as con&s;tantly at war with the woman, and per&s;ecuting the church of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be &s;ome relief to the Chri&s;tian church; but, on the contrary, that wounding to death, that Mr. Lowman &s;peaks of, was the victory of the enemies of the Chri&s;tian church over her, and the wound received from them.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of that head of the empire that &s;hall be next after the &s;ixth head, and next before Antichri&s;t, and that is not reckoned as properly one of the number of the heads of the bea&s;t, that <HI>when it comes, it &s;hall con|tinue a &s;hort &s;pace,</HI> chap. xvii. 10. By which we may under&s;tand, at lea&s;t, that it &s;hall be one of the &s;horte&s;t, in its continuance, of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive heads. But the government &s;eat|ed at Ravenna, in the hands of the Goths, or of the deputies of the Greek emperors,
<PB N="256" REF="026594_0257_0FD0B3C68BEFD8E0">(which Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es to be meant by the head) continued, as Mr. Lowman him&s;elf takes notice, very near three hundred years. And if &s;o, its continuance was one of the longe&s;t of the heads mentioned.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, if the government that Rome was under, from the time that Augu&s;tulus abdicated, to the time when the Pope was confirmed in his temporal dominion, was meant by the &s;eventh head that was to be between the imperial head and the papal, there would doubtle&s;s have been two differ|ent heads mentioned, in&s;tead of one, between the Emperor and the Pope, viz. Fir&s;t, the Gothic princes, which reigned near an hun|dred years. Secondly, the Exarchs of Ra|venna, which governed for about one hun|dred and eighty-five years. The Gothic kingdom was much more properly a di&s;tinct government from the Imperial, than the Ex|archate of Ravenna; for during the Exar|chate, Rome was under the government of the emperor, as much as it was in Con&s;tan|tine's time.</P>
<P>In Rev. xvii. 12. it is &s;aid, the <HI>ten horns are ten kings, which are to receive power as kings one hour with the bea&s;t,</HI> or (as Mr. Low|man &s;ays, it ought to have been tran&s;lated)
<PB N="257" REF="026594_0258_0FD0B3C7A92157B8"><HI>the &s;ame hour,</HI> or <HI>point of time with the bea&s;t.</HI> This will not allow the time when Antichri&s;t fir&s;t receives power as king, to be &s;o late as Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es. This divi&s;ion of the empire into many kingdoms, denoted by the number ten, was about the year four hun|dred and fifty-&s;ix, after Gen&s;ericus had tak|en the city of Rome; but Mr. Lowman pla|ces the beginning of the reign of Antichri&s;t in the year &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, which is three hundred years later. I know, &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion as <HI>in one hour,</HI> or <HI>the &s;ame hour,</HI> may allow &s;ome latitude, but &s;urely not &s;uch a latitude as this.

<P>Mr. Lowman greatly in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that what is &s;poken as continuing one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days, is not &s;o much and &s;piritual authority or eccle&s;ia&s;tical pow|er of the Pope, over the nations of Chri&s;ten|dom, as his temporal government and domi|nion in that individual city of Rome, and therefore to determine when the&s;e one thou|&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days or years began, and when they will end, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider when the Pope fir&s;t received this his temporal power over the city of Rome, and the neighbouring regions, called St. Peter's Patrimony. But I can &s;ee no good rea&s;on for this. Indeed it is &s;trange, if it be &s;o.&mdash;God has been plea&s;ed in the&s;e revelations
<PB N="259" REF="026594_0260_0FD0B3CB08BE8298">and prophecies, which he has given for the benefit of his church in general, to &s;peak much concerning an anti-chri&s;tian power that &s;hould ari&s;e, that &s;hould <HI>per&s;ecute the &s;aints, and &s;catter the power of the holy peo|ple,</HI> and be an occa&s;ion of great affliction to the church of Chri&s;t; and in the&s;e revela|tions, in both Old Te&s;tament and New, has declared, and often repeated it, that his do|minion &s;hall continue &s;o long, and no longer; and for the comfort of his church in general, Chri&s;t hath-&s;worn with great &s;olemnity, that the continuance of this per&s;ecuting power &s;hall be limited, Dan. xii. 7. Now it would be &s;trange if, in all this, the thing principal|ly intended is not that dominion of this an|ti-chri&s;tian power which chiefly concerns the church of Chri&s;t in general, but merely his temporal dominion over one movince in I|taly, called St. Peter's Patrimony. Doubt|le&s;s, that dominion of Antichri&s;t, which the prophecies in&s;i&s;t upon and de&s;cribe, is the dominion who&s;e duration and limits tho&s;e prophecies declare. But the dominion of Antichri&s;t which the prophecies in&s;i&s;t upon and de&s;cribe, is not any dominion over a particular province in Italy, but the domi|nion by which he &s;ucceeds the four great
<PB N="260" REF="026594_0261_0FD0B3CC262D8B58"><HI>monarchies of the world,</HI> Dan. vii. The do|minion by which he <HI>&s;ucceeds the dragon in his power, throne and great authority,</HI> Rev. xiii. 2. The dominion in which he has <HI>pow|er given him over all kindreds, tongues and nations,</HI> ver. 7. The dominion by which <HI>the great whore &s;its on many waters,</HI> chap. xvii. 1. which the angel explains to be <HI>peo|ples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,</HI> ver. 15. and the dominion in which he <HI>reigns over the ten kings,</HI> into which the Roman empire is divided, Rev. xiii. 1. and xviii. 3.12, 13. The bea&s;t that had ten horns, is not the city of Rome, and the neighbouring re|gion, but the Roman empire; they are the horns or the kings, not of the city, but of the empire. If we con&s;ider what is expre&s;&s;|ed in the pa&s;&s;ages them&s;elves, which &s;peak of the three years and an half of Antichri&s;t, they will lead us to under&s;tand &s;omething very diver&s;e from the duration of his tem|poral dominion over St. Peter's Patrimony. In Dan vii. 25. the time, times, and half of the little horn, is expre&s;sly the continvance of time, wherein <HI>it &s;hall be given to him to change times and laws, and wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High;</HI> and in chap. xii. 7. it is &s;poken of as <HI>the time of his &s;cattering the
<PB N="261" REF="026594_0262_0FD0B3CDA8284600">power of the holy people;</HI> in Rev. xi. 2. the forty and two months is &s;poken of as the time of Antichri&s;t's <HI>treading under foot the court of the temple and the holy city;</HI> i. e. the external and vi&s;ible Chri&s;tian church abroad in the world, or the nations of Chri&s;tendom. In ver. 3. the one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days of Antichri&s;t are &s;poken of as the time of the <HI>witne&s;&s;es prophe&s;ying in &s;ackcloth;</HI> and in chap. xii. 6. and 14. the time of the <HI>woman's being in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> which was through the great power that Antichri&s;t had over the Chri&s;tian world, and not his &s;mall temporal dominion in Italy.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ome regard is had in the pro|phecies to the city of Rome, the city built on &s;even hills; which being the fountain of all rule and authority in the Roman monar|chy, and the capital city in the empire, from whence the whole empire was denominated, and the place where the head of the empire u&s;ually re&s;ided, was properly made u&s;e of by the angel, Rev. xvii. 9, 18. to &s;hew what empire Antichri&s;t &s;hould rule over, and what city he &s;hould u&s;ually re&s;ide in. And this is all that can be meant by the words of the angel; and not that tho&s;e &s;treets and walls, and the very ground, were &s;uch main and
<PB N="262" REF="026594_0263_0FD0B3CF26F5ADB8">e&s;&s;ential things in what the prophecy intend|ed by the bea&s;t; that when Antichri&s;t's do|minion cea&s;es in that place, then the bea&s;t cea&s;es. For, if &s;o, then it will &s;ollow, that the bea&s;t had his head wounded to death a &s;econd time, and cea&s;ed to be, when the Popes re&s;ided at Avignon in France, for the be&s;t part of a century; when not only the Popes did not re&s;ide in Rome, nor in any part of St. Peter's Patrimony, nor any part of Italy, but &s;ome of them were neither Ro|mans nor Italians. Though the angel &s;ays of the great whore, Rev. xvii. 18. <HI>The wo|man which thou &s;awe&s;t, is the great city which reigns over the kings of the earth;</HI> yet by the city, in this ca&s;e, is not meant &s;o much what was contained within tho&s;e Roman walls, as the Roman empire, as is evident by chap. xi. 8. <HI>And their dead bodies &s;hall lie in the &s;treet of the great city, which is &s;piritually call|ed Sodom and Egypt.</HI> Here, by that great city, neither Mr. Lowman him&s;elf, nor, I &s;uppo&s;e, any other Prote&s;tant interpreter, under&s;tands the city of Rome, &s;trictly &s;peaking, but the Roman monarchy.</P>
<P>And though it be true, as Mr. Lowman ob&s;erves, the Pope's eccle&s;ia&s;tical monarchy, and power and influence through Chri&s;ten|dom,
<PB N="263" REF="026594_0264_0FD0B3D0A6DA03B0">was greatly e&s;tabli&s;hed and advanced by Pepin's making him a temporal prince over the Exarchate of Ravenna; yet, I would a&s;k, whether the Pope's power and influence in the world, and his ability to di&s;turb the quiet of the nations of Chri&s;tendom, and (as it is expre&s;&s;ed in Daniel) <HI>to change times and laws,</HI> and to carry his own de&s;igns, in the various countries and kingdoms of Eu|rope, was not greater before Pepin, than it is now, and has been for a long time? And yet Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es that now is properly the time of Antichri&s;t's reign, that the one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years of his reign continues, and will continue for about two hundred and &s;eventy years longer; tho' his power be now &s;o &s;mall, and has been de|clining ever &s;ince the reformation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;till declines continually.</P>
<P>One thing that Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es con|firms his opinion of &s;o late a beginning of the one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years of the reign of the bea&s;t, is the order of the &s;everal periods of this prophecy, and the man|ner of their &s;ucceeding one another.</P>
<P>As to his particular &s;cheme of the &s;even periods, &s;o divided and limited, and &s;o ob|viou&s;ly ranked in &s;uch order, and following
<PB N="264" REF="026594_0265_0FD0B3D24670A6B0">one another in &s;uch direct and continual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and each ending in a &s;tate of peace, &s;afety and happine&s;s to the church of God, it &s;eems to me to be more ingenious than &s;olid, and that many things might be &s;aid to demon&s;trate it not to be founded in the truth of things, and the real de&s;ign of the divine author of this prophecy. But now to enter into a particular and full examination of it, would be to lengthen out this di&s;cour&s;e far beyond its proper limits. I would only ob|&s;erve, (which directly concerns my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e) that to make out this &s;cheme, Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es that the fifth and &s;ixth trumpets, that bring on the two fir&s;t woes, and the whole ninth chapter of the Revela|tion, altogether re&s;pects the Saracens. But it appears to me not very credible, that the Saracens &s;hould have &s;o much &s;aid of them in this prophecy, as to have a whole chap|ter taken up about them, and not a word in the prophecy be &s;aid about the Turks, who immediately &s;ucceeded them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For though it be true, that the reign of Othman, or Ottoman, who began what they call the Ottoman empire, was a long time after this; yet the Turks them&s;elves, under other princes, in the government they &s;et up in territories that had formerly been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Chri&s;tians, and in their over-running and ravaging Chri&s;|tian countries, immediately &s;ucceeding the Saracens; and from thenceforward have been a terrible, and almo&s;t continual &s;courge to the church.</NOTE> in the &s;ame

<P>Mr. Lowman, in pur&s;uance of his &s;cheme, al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es, (which is yet more incredible) this period of the trumpets ends in <HI>a &s;tate of &s;afety, peace and happine&s;s to the church of God;</HI> &s;o that, on that occa&s;ion, <HI>there are great voices in heaven, &s;aying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t.</HI> And yet he &s;uppo&s;es, that it i&s;&s;ues in &s;etting up the kingdom of Anti|chri&s;t; and that about that very time, when the&s;e heavenly voices &s;o joyfully proclaim|ed this, the bea&s;t was enthroned, and the time, times and half, or one thou&s;and two
<PB N="266" REF="026594_0267_0FD0B3D5270E5250">hundred and &s;ixty days of his reign began, which is &s;poken of every where, as the time of the church's greate&s;t darkne&s;s and trou|ble, the time wherein <HI>the little horn &s;hould wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High.

The time of treading under foot the court of the temple.</HI> And <HI>the time of the witne&s;&s;es prophe&s;ying in &s;ackcloth.</HI></P>
<P>However, I do not deny that the time when Mr. Lowman &s;uppo&s;es the reign of the bea&s;t began, even the time when Pepin confirm|ed to the Pope his temporal dominions in Italy, was a time of the great increa&s;e and advancement of the power of Antichri&s;t in the world, and a notable epoch. And if I may be allowed humbly to offer what ap|pears to me to be the truth with relation to the ri&s;e and fall of Antichri&s;t, it is this&mdash;As the power of Antichri&s;t, and the corruption of the apo&s;tate church, ro&s;e not at once, but by &s;everal notable &s;teps and degrees, &s;o it will in the like manner fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and that divers &s;teps and &s;ea&s;ons of de&s;truction to the &s;pirit|ual Babylon, and revival and advancement of the true c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rch, are prophe&s;ied of under one.

<P>It was certainly thus with regard to the prophecies of the de&s;truction of old Baby|lon, and the church's deliverance from cap|tivity and oppre&s;&s;ion by that city and king|dom, which is abundantly alluded to in the&s;e prophecies of the Revelation, as a noted type of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the church of Chri&s;t by the church of Rome, calling the latter &s;o often by the name of Babylon, and the church of Chri&s;t Jeru&s;alem. The captivity of the Jews by the Babylonians was not perfected at once, but was brought on by &s;everal not|able &s;teps. So neither was the re&s;toration of the Jewi&s;h church, after the captivity, per|fected at once. It was &s;everal times fore|told, that the duration of the captivity &s;hould be &s;eventy years; and al&s;o, that after &s;even|ty years were accompli&s;hed, God would de|&s;troy Babylon.

<PB N="268" REF="026594_0269_0FD0B3D8F0AEEBD0">to Cyrus's decree, for the return of the Jews, and the rebuilding of Jeru&s;alem, was &s;eventy years. And from Zedekiah's capti|vity to Darius's decree &s;eventy years. And from the la&s;t carrying away of all, to the fi|ni&s;hing and dedication of the temple, was al&s;o &s;eventy years. So al&s;o the prophecies of Babylon's de&s;truction were fulfilled by &s;e|veral &s;teps. The&s;e prophecies feem to have a principal re&s;pect to that de&s;truction that was accompli&s;hed by Cyrus, at the end of the fir&s;t &s;eventy years fore-mentioned; but there were other things in the very &s;ame prophecies, that were not fulfilled until the fourth year of Darius, when what remained of Babylon was &s;ubjected to another dread|ful de&s;truction, which, in a great mea&s;ure, completed its de&s;olation, which was at the end of the &s;econd &s;eventy years, and at the &s;ame time that the re&s;toration of the Jews was perfected by the decree of Darius.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prideanx's Connection, part I. p. 183, 184, and 267, 268, 269.

<P>The prophecy of the &s;ixth Vial, Rev. xvi. 12&mdash;16. if we take it in its connection with the other Vials, and con&s;ider tho&s;e provi|dential events, by which the preceding Vials have manife&s;tly been fulfilled, I humbly con|ceive, affords ju&s;t ground for &s;uch a hope.</P>
<P>It is very plain, from this whole chapter, as al&s;o the preceding and following, that all the&s;e &s;even Vials are Vials of God's wrath on Antichri&s;t; one is not poured out on the Jews, another on the Turks, another on Pagans. another on the church of Rome; but they all &s;ignify God's &s;ucce&s;&s;ive judgments or plagues on the bea&s;t and his kingdom, which is in this chapter and almo&s;t every where in this book, called GREAT BABYLON. And therefore undoubtedly, when it is &s;aid, <HI>The
<PB N="277" REF="026594_0278_0FD0B3E7ED3234A8">&s;ixth angel poured out his Vial on the river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the ea&s;t might be prepared.</HI> By the river Euphrates is meant &s;omething &s;ome way appertaining to this my&s;tical Babylon, as that river that ran thro' Chaldea, called Euphrates, was &s;omething appertaining to the literal Babylon. And it is very manife&s;t, that here is in the pro|phecy of this Vial an allu&s;ion to that by which the way was prepared for the de&s;truc|tion of Babylon by Cyrus, which was by turn|ing the channel of the river Euphrates, which ran through the mid&s;t of the city, whereby the way of the kings of the ea&s;t, the princes of Media and Per&s;ia, was prepared to come in under the walls of the city, at each end, where the waters u&s;ed to run, and de&s;troy it; as they did that night wherein Daniel in|terpreted the hand-writing on the wall, a|gain&s;t Bel&s;hazzar, Dan. v. 30. The prophe|cies of Babylon's de&s;truction do, from time to time, take notice of this way of de&s;troy|ing her, by drying up the waters of the riv|er Euphrates, to prepare the way for her enemies, I&s;ai. xliv. 27, 28. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at &s;aith to the deep&mdash;Be dry&mdash;and I will dry up thy rivers; that &s;aith of Cyrus&mdash;He is my &s;ervant, and

<PB N="279" REF="026594_0280_0FD0B3E7FB2641F8">on the my&s;tical Babylon, and the effect of it, the drying up the channel of the river Eu|phrates, is the la&s;t thing done again&s;t it, be|fore its actual de&s;truction by the &s;eventh Vial, and opens the way for tho&s;e that fight in a &s;piritual war again&s;t it, &s;peedily to bring on its ruin.</P>
<P>Hence I think it may, without di&s;pute, be determined, that by the river Euphrates in the prophecy of this Vial, is meant &s;ome|thing appertaining or relating to the my&s;ti|cal Babylon, or the anti-chri&s;tian church and kingdom, that &s;erves that, or is a benefit to it, in a way an&s;werable to that in which the river Euphrates &s;erved old Babylon, and the removal of which will in like manner pre|pare the way for her enemies to de&s;troy her. And therefore what we have to do in the fir&s;t place, in order to find out what is in|tended by the river Euphrates, in this pro|phecy, is to con&s;ider how the literal Eu|phrates &s;erved old Babylon. And it may be noted that Euphrates was of remarkable be|nefit to that great city in two re&s;pects; it &s;erved the city as a &s;upply&mdash;it was let thro' the mid&s;t of the city by an artificial canal, and ran through the mid&s;t of the palace of the king of Babylon; that part of his pa|lace
<PB N="280" REF="026594_0281_0FD0B3E965FAB7A0">called the Old Palace, &s;tanding on one &s;ide, and the other part called the New Pa|lace, on the other; with communications from one part to another, above the waters, by a bridge, and under the waters, by a vault|ed or arched pa&s;&s;age, that the city, and e&s;|pecially the palace, might have the conve|nience of its waters, and be plentifully &s;up|plied with water. And another way that the waters of Euphrates &s;erved Babylon, was as an impediment and ob&s;tacle in the way of its enemies, to hinder their acce&s;s to it to de&s;troy it; for there was a va&s;t moat round the city, without the walls, of prodigious width and depth, filled with the water of the river, to hinder the acce&s;s of her be&s;ieg|ers; and at each end of the city, the river &s;erved in&s;tead of walls. And therefore when Cyrus had dried up the river, the moat was emptied, and the channel of the river un|der the walls left dry, and &s;o his way was prepared.</P>
<P>And therefore it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that by drying up the waters of the river Euphrates, in the prophecy of the de&s;truc|tion of the new Babylon, to prepare the way of her enemies, is meant the drying up her incomes and &s;upplies, and the removal of
<PB N="281" REF="026594_0282_0FD0B3EB10A86780">tho&s;e things that hitherto have been the chief ob&s;tacles in the way of tho&s;e that, in this book, are repre&s;ented as at war with her, and &s;eeking her de&s;truction, (&s;poken of Rev. xix. 11. to the end, and chap. xii. 7.) that have hindered their progre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, or that have been the chief impediments in the way of the Prote&s;tant religion. The fir&s;t thing is the drying the &s;treams of the wealth of the new Babylon, the temporal &s;upplies, revenues, and va&s;t incomes of the Romi&s;h church, and the riches of the Popi&s;h domi|nions. Waters in &s;cripture language very often &s;ignify provi&s;ion and &s;upplies, both temporal and &s;piritual, as in Prov. ix. 17. I&s;ai. xxxiii. 16.&mdash;xliii. 20.&mdash;lv. 1. and lviii. 11. Jer. ii. 13 and 18.&mdash;xvii. 8 and 13. and in other places innumerable. The tempor|al &s;upplies of a people are very often in &s;crip|ture called waters, as I&s;ai. v. 13. <HI>Therefore my people is gone into captivity, and their ho|nourable men are fami&s;hed, and their multi|tude dried up with thir&s;t,</HI> i. e. deprived of the &s;upports and &s;upplies of life. And the drying up the waters of a city or kingdom, is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture prophecy, for the depriving them of their wealth, as the &s;crip|ture
<PB N="282" REF="026594_0283_0FD0B3EE4503B4E8">explains it&s;elf, Ho&s;. xiii. 15. <HI>His &s;prings &s;hall become dry, and his fountain &s;hall be dried up: He &s;hall &s;poil the trea&s;ure of all plea&s;ant ve&s;&s;els.</HI> I&s;ai. xv. 6, 7. <HI>The waters of Nim|rim &s;hall be de&s;olate, for the hay is withered, the gra&s;s faileth, there is no green thing.&mdash; Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, &s;hall they carry away to the brook of the willows.</HI> By the brook of the willows there &s;eems to be a re|ference to the waters of A&s;&s;yria or Chaldea, who&s;e &s;treams abounded with willows. So that the carrying away the trea&s;ures of Moab, and adding of them to the trea&s;ures of A&s;|&s;yria, is here repre&s;ented by the figure of turning away the waters of Nimrim from the country of Moab, and adding them to the waters of A&s;&s;yria, as the prophecy explains it&s;elf. Yea, even in the prophecies of the de&s;truction of Babylon it&s;elf, the depriving her of her trea&s;ures, &s;eems to be one thing intended by the drying up of her waters.&mdash; This &s;eems manife&s;t by the words of the pro|phecy in Jer. l. 37, 38. <HI>A &s;word is upon her trea&s;ures, and they &s;hall be robbed; a drought is upon her waters, and they &s;hall be dried up.</HI> Compared with chap. li. 15. <HI>O thou that dwelle&s;t upon many waters, abundant in trea|&s;ures;</HI>

The&s;e are e&s;pecially the waters that &s;upply the palace of the king of this new Babylon, viz. the Pope, as the river Euphrates ran through the mid&s;t of the palace of the king of old Babylon.

<P>This prophecy repre&s;ents to us two cities very contrary the one to the other&mdash;viz. New Babylon and the New Jeru&s;alem, and

<P>If any &s;hould object again&s;t under&s;tanding the river Euphrates, in Rev. xvi. 12. as &s;ig|nifying what has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that when mention is made of the river Euphrates, in another place in this prophecy, it is mani|fe&s;tly not &s;o to be under&s;tood, viz. in chap. ix. 14. <HI>Saying to the &s;ixth angel which had the trumpet&mdash;Loo&s;e the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates:</HI> and that there is no rea&s;on to under&s;tand the river Euphrates in the vi&s;ion of the &s;ixth Vial, as &s;ignifying &s;omething diver&s;e from what is meant by the &s;ame river in the vi&s;ion of the &s;ixth trumpet.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That there appears to me to be good rea&s;on for a diver&s;e under&s;tanding of the river Euphrates in the&s;e two different places; the diver&s;ity of the &s;cence of the vi|&s;ion, and of the kind of repre&s;entation, in tho&s;e two divers parts of this prophecy, na|turally leads to it, and requires it. It is in this book as in the Old Te&s;tament; when the river Euphrates is &s;poken of in the Old Te&s;tament, both in the hi&s;tories and prophe|cies, it is mentioned, with re&s;pect to the two|fold relation of that river, viz. 1&s;t, with re|gard
<PB N="294" REF="026594_0295_0FD0B4319E275088">to its relation to Babylon. And as it was related to that, it was &s;omething belong|ing to that city, as its defence and &s;upply, as has been repre&s;ented. Thus the river Eu|phrates is &s;poken of in many places that have been already ob&s;erved, and others that might be mentioned. 2dly. This river is &s;poken of with regard to its relation to the land of I&s;rael, God's vi&s;ible people; and as it was re|lated to that, it was its ea&s;tern boundary. It is &s;o &s;poken of, Gen. xv. 18. Exod. xxiii. 31. Deut. i. 7. and xi. 24. Jo&s;h. i. 4.2 Sam. viii. 3.1 Chron. xviii. 3.1 King iv. 21. Ezra iv. 20. Agreeable to this diver&s;e re|&s;pect or relation of this river, under which it is mentioned in the Old Te&s;tament, &s;o mu&s;t we under&s;tand it differently in different parts of the prophecy of this book of Reve|lation, according as the nature and &s;ubject of the vi&s;ion requires. In the xvth chapter, where the prophecy is about Babylon, and the vi&s;ion is of God's plagues on Babylon, preparing the way for her de&s;truction, there, when the river Euphrates is mentioned, we are naturally and nece&s;&s;arily led to con&s;ider it as &s;omething belonging to Babylon, ap|pertaining to the my&s;tical Babylon, as Eu|phrates did to old Babylon. But we cannot
<PB N="295" REF="026594_0296_0FD0B40B264499B0">under&s;tand it &s;o in the ixth chapter, for there the prophecy is not about Babylon. To men|tion Euphrates there, as &s;omething belong|ing to Babylon, would have been improper; for the nature of the vi&s;ion, and prophetical repre&s;entation, did not lead to it, nor allow it. John had had no vi&s;ion of Babylon; that kind of repre&s;entation had not been made to him; there is not a word &s;aid about Ba|bylon till we come to the &s;econd part of this prophecy, after John had the vi&s;ion of the &s;econd book, and Chri&s;t had &s;aid to him&mdash; <HI>Thou mu&s;t prophecy again before peoples, and nations, and kings,</HI> chap. xi. The &s;cene of the vi&s;ion, in the former part of the prophe|cy, had been more e&s;pecially the land of I&s;|rael, and the vi&s;ion is concerning two &s;orts of per&s;ons there, viz. tho&s;e of the tribes of I&s;rael that had the &s;eal of God in their fore|heads, and tho&s;e wicked apo&s;tate I&s;raelites that had not this mark. Compare chap. vii. 3&mdash;8. and chap. ix. 4. The vi&s;ion in this ixth chapter, is of God's jndgments on tho&s;e of the tribes of I&s;rael, or in the land of I&s;rael, which had not the &s;eal of God in their fore|heads; and therefore when mention is made, ver. 14. of a judgment coming on them from the river Euphrates, this river is here &s;poken
<PB N="296" REF="026594_0297_0FD0B434665BE2A0">of in the former re&s;pect, viz. with regard to its relation to the land of I&s;rael, as its ea&s;t|ern border; and thereby we mu&s;t under&s;tand that God would bring &s;ome terrible calami|ty on Chri&s;tendom from its ea&s;tern border, as he did when the Turks were let loo&s;e up|on Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things that have been &s;poken of, are intended in the prophecy of the &s;ixth Vial, it affords, as I conceive, great rea&s;on to hope that the beginning of that glorious work of God's Spirit, which, in the progre&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of it, will overthrow Antichri&s;t, and introduce the glory of the latter days, is not very far off.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowman has, I think, put it beyond all rea&s;onable doubt, that the fifth Vial was poured out in the time of the Reformation. It al&s;o appears &s;atisfyingly, by his late Expo|&s;ition, that take one Vial with another, it has not been two hundred years from the begin|ning of one Vial to the beginning of ano|ther, but about one hundred and eighty years. But it is now two hundred and twen|ty years &s;ince the fifth Vial began to be poured, and it is a long time &s;ince the main effects of it have been &s;ini&s;hed. And there|fore if the &s;ixth Vial has not already began
<PB N="297" REF="026594_0298_0FD0B40CD154C098">to be poured out, it may well be &s;peedily expected.</P>
<P>But with regard to the fir&s;t thing that I have &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ignified by the effect of this Vial, viz. The drying up the fountains and &s;treams of the wealth and temporal in|comes and &s;upplies of the antichri&s;tian church and territories, I would propo&s;e it to con&s;i|deration, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no many things that have come to pa&s;s within the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, may not be looked upon as pro|bable beginnings of a fulfilment of this pro|phecy; particularly what the kings of Spain and Portugal did &s;ome years &s;ince, when di&s;|plea&s;ed with the Pope, forbidding any thence|forward going to Rome for inve&s;titures, &amp;c. thereby cutting off two great &s;treams of the Pope's wealth, from &s;o great and rich a part of the Popi&s;h world; and its becoming &s;o frequent a thing of late for Popi&s;h princes, in their wars, to make bold with the trea|&s;ure of the church, and to tax the clergy within their dominions, as well as laity; or which is equivalent, to oblige them to con|tribute great &s;ums, under the name of a free gift; and al&s;o the late peeling and impove|ri&s;hing the Pope's temporal dominions in
<PB N="298" REF="026594_0299_0FD07FDE8BDB9D30">Italy, by the armies of the Au&s;trians, Nea|politans and Spaniards, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing through them, and living &s;o much at di&s;cre|tion in them, of which the Pope has &s;o loud|ly complained, and in vain; receiving no|thing but menaces, when he has objected a|gain&s;t giving liberty for the like pa&s;&s;age for the future. The&s;e things make it hopeful that the time is coming when the princes of Europe, <HI>the ten horns, &s;hall hate the whore, and make her de&s;olate and naked, and eat her fle&s;h,</HI> as Rev. xvii. 16. which will prepare the way for what next follows, <HI>her being burnt with fire;</HI> even as the &s;ixth Vial poured out, to con&s;ume the &s;upplies of Antichri&s;t, and &s;trip him naked of his wealth, and, as it were, to pick his fle&s;h off from his bones, will make way for what next follows, the &s;eventh Vial, that will con&s;ume Antichri&s;t, by the &s;ierce|ne&s;s of God's wrath.</P>
<P>The&s;e things duly con&s;idered, I imagine, afford us ground to &s;uppo&s;e, not only that the effect of this &s;ixth Vial is already begun, but that &s;ome progre&s;s is already made in it, and that this Vial is now running apace. And when it &s;hall be fini&s;hed, there is all rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the de&s;truction of Anti|chri&s;t will very &s;peedily follow, and that the
<PB N="299" REF="026594_0300_0FD0B40E45263108">two la&s;t Vials will &s;ucceed one another more clo&s;ely than the other Vials. When once the river Euphrates was dried up, and Cy|rus's way was prepared, he delayed not, but immediately entered into the city to de&s;troy it. Nor is it God's manner, when once his way is prepared, to delay to deliver his church, and &s;hew mercy to Zion. When once impediments are removed, Chri&s;t will no longer remain at a di&s;tance, but will be like a roe or a young hart, coming &s;wiftly to the help of his people. When that cry is made, <HI>Ca&s;t ye up, ca&s;t ye up, prepare the way,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The high and lofty One that inha|bits eternity, is repre&s;ented as very near to re|vive the &s;pirit of the contrite, and deliver his people with whom he had been wroth.</HI> When that cry is made, I&s;ai. xl. <HI>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make &s;traight in the de&s;art an high-way for our God; every valley &s;hall be exalted,</HI> &amp;c. God tells his church, <HI>that her warfare is accompli&s;hed, and the time to comfort her is come, and that the glory of the Lord n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;hall be revealed, and all fle&s;h &s;ee it together.</HI> And agreeably to the&s;e things, Chri&s;t, on the pouring out the &s;ixth Vial, &s;ays, <HI>Behold I come.</HI> The &s;ixth Vial is the forerunner of the &s;eventh or la&s;t, to prepare
<PB N="300" REF="026594_0301_0FD0B437A09A1D78">its way. The angel that pours out this Vial is the harbinger of Chri&s;t, and when the har|binger is come, the king is at hand. John the Bapti&s;t, that was Chri&s;t's harbinger, who came to level mountains and fill up vallies, proclaimed, <HI>The kingdom of heaven is at hand;</HI> and when he had prepared Chri&s;t's way, then <HI>the Lord &s;uddenly came into his temple, even the me&s;&s;enger of the covenant.</HI> Mal. iii. 1.</P>
<P>It is true, that we do not know how long this Vial may continue running, and &s;o Chri&s;t's way preparing, before it is fully prepared; but yet if there be rea&s;on to think the effect of this Vial is begun, or is near, then there is rea&s;on al&s;o to think that the beginning of that great work of God's Spirit, in reviving of religion, which, before it is fini&s;hed, will i&s;&s;ue in Antichri&s;t's ruin, is not far off. For it is pretty manife&s;t, that the beginning of this work will accompany the &s;ixth Vial; for the gathering together of the armies on both &s;ides, on the &s;ide of Chri&s;t and Anti|chri&s;t, to that great battle that &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in the overthrow of the latter, will be under this Vial; (compare Rev. xvi. 12, 13, 14. with chap. xix. 11. to the end.)

<P>All the &s;even Vials bring terrible judg|ments upon Antichri&s;t; but there &s;eems to be &s;omething di&s;tingui&s;hing of the three la&s;t, the fifth, &s;ixth and &s;eventh, viz. That they
<PB N="302" REF="026594_0303_0FD0B439617ACD00">more directly tend to the overthrow of his kingdom, and accordingly each of them is attended with a great reviving of religion. The fifth Vial was attended with &s;uch a re|vival and reformation, that greatly weaken|ed and dimini&s;hed the throne or kingdom of the bea&s;t, and went far towards its ruin. It &s;eems as though the &s;ixth Vial &s;hould be much more &s;o, for it is the di&s;tingui&s;hing note of this Vial, that it is the preparatory Vial, which more than any other Vial pre|pares the way for Chri&s;t's coming to de&s;troy the kingdom of Antichri&s;t, and to &s;et up his own kingdom in the world. A great out|pouring of the Spirit accompanied that di&s;|pen&s;ation which was preparatory to Chri&s;t's coming in his public mini&s;try, in the days of his fle&s;h; &s;o, much more, will a great out|pouring of the Spirit accompany the di&s;|pen&s;ation that will be preparatory to Chri&s;t's coming in his kingdom.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides tho&s;e things which belong to the preparation of Chri&s;t's way, which are &s;o often repre&s;ented by levelling mountains, drying up rivers, &amp;c. viz. The unravelling intricacies, and removing difficulties attend|ing Chri&s;tian doctrines, the di&s;tingui&s;hing between true religion and its fal&s;e appear|ances,
<PB N="303" REF="026594_0304_0FD0B4112830BA10">the detecting and exploding errors and corrupt principles, and the reforming the wicked lives of profe&s;&s;ors, which have been the chief &s;tumbling-blocks and ob&s;ta|cles that have hitherto hindered the progre&s;s of true religion; I &s;ay, the&s;e things, which &s;eem to belong to this preparatory Vial, are the proper work of the Spirit of God, pro|moting and advancing divine light and true piety, and can be the effect of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Agreeably to what has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that an extraordinary out-pouring of the Spirit of God is to accompany this &s;ixth Vial; &s;o the beginning of a work of extraordinary a|wakening has already attended the probable beginning of this Vial; and has been con|tinued in one place or other, for many years pa&s;t; although it has been, in &s;ome places, mingled with much enthu&s;ia&s;m, after the manner of things in their fir&s;t beginnings, unripe, and mixed with much crudity. But it is to be hoped, a far more pure, exten|&s;ive and glorious revival of religion is not far off, which will more properly be the be|ginning of that work, which, in its i&s;&s;ue, &s;hall overthrow the kingdom of Antichri&s;t, and of Satan through the world. But God <HI>will be enquired of for this, by the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael to do it for them.</HI></P>

If, notwith&s;tanding all that I have &s;aid, it be &s;till judged that there is &s;ufficient rea&s;on to determine that the ruin of Anti|chri&s;t is at a very great di&s;tance, and if all that I have &s;aid, as arguing that there is rea|&s;on to hope the beginning of that glorious revival of religion, which, in its continuance and progre&s;s, will de&s;troy the kingdom of Antichri&s;t, is not very far off, be judged to be of no force; yet it will not follow, that our complying with what is propo&s;ed to us in the late memorial from Scotland, will be in vain, or not followed with &s;uch &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, as will richly recompence the pains of &s;uch extraordinary prayer for the Holy Spirit, and the revival of religion. If God does not grant that greate&s;t of all effu&s;ions of his Spirit, &s;o &s;oon as we de&s;ire, yet we &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our having employed our&s;elves in a man|ner that is certainly agreeable to Chri&s;t's will and frequent commands, in being much in prayer for this mercy, and much more in it than has heretofore been common with Chri&s;tians; and there will be all rea&s;on to hope, that we &s;hall receive &s;ome ble&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ken of his acceptance.

<P>I would &s;ay &s;omething to one objection more, and then ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 6. Some may be ready to object, that what is propo&s;ed in this memorial is a new thing, &s;uch as never was put in practice in the church of God before.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. If there be &s;omething circum&s;tan|tially new in it, this cannot be a &s;ufficient objection. The duty of prayer is no new duty; for many of God's people expre&s;sly to agree, as touching &s;omething they &s;hall a&s;k in prayer, is no new thing; for God's people to agree on circum&s;tances of time and place for united prayer, according to their own di&s;cretion, is no new thing; for many, in different places, to agree to offer up ex|traordinary prayers to God, at the &s;ame time, as a token of their union, is no new thing, but has been commonly practi&s;ed in the ap|pointment of days of fa&s;ting and prayer for
<PB N="306" REF="026594_0307_0FD0B43CB77D3340">&s;pecial mercies. And if the people of God &s;hould engage in the duty of prayer, for the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, in a new man|ner, in that re&s;pect, that they re&s;olve they will not be &s;o negligent of this duty, as has been common with profe&s;&s;ors of religion heretofore, but will be more frequent and fervent in it; this would be &s;uch a new thing as ought to be, and would be only to reform a former negligence. And for the people of God, in various parts of the world, vi&s;ibly, and by expre&s;s agreement, to unite for this extraordinary prayer, is no more than their duty, and no more than what it is foretold the people of God &s;hould actual|ly do, before the time comes of the church's promi&s;ed glory on earth. And if this be a duty, then it is a duty to come into &s;ome method to render this practicable; but it is not practicable (as was &s;hewn before) but by this method, or &s;ome other equivalent.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. As to this particular method, pro|po&s;ed to promote union in extraordinary prayer, viz. God's people, in various parts, &s;etting apart fixed &s;ea&s;ons, to return at cer|tain periods, wherein they agree to offer up their prayers at the &s;ame time, it is not &s;o new as &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly imagine. This

It is &s;carce imagin|able how a pro&s;e&s;&s;ing people &s;hould &s;tand in greater need of prayer, than we do at this day.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>And now, upon the whole, I de&s;ire every
<PB N="312" REF="026594_0313_0FD0B4414A5C4478">&s;erious Chri&s;tian, that may read this di&s;cour&s;e, calmly and deliberately to con&s;ider whether he can excu&s;e him&s;elf from complying with what has been propo&s;ed to us and reque&s;ted of us, by tho&s;e mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in Scot|land, who are the authors of the late memo|rial. God has &s;tirred up a part of his church, in a di&s;tant part of the world, to be in an extraordinary manner &s;eeking and crying to him, that he would appear to favour Zion, as he has promi&s;ed. And they are applying them&s;elves to us, to join with them, and make that very propo&s;al to us which is &s;poken of in my text, and in like manner and circum|&s;tances. The members of one church, in one country, are coming to others, in other di&s;tant countries, &s;aying <HI>Let us go &s;peedily and con&s;tantly to pray before the Lord, and to &s;eek the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Will it not become us readily to &s;ay, <HI>I will go al&s;o?</HI> What the&s;e &s;ervants of Chri&s;t a&s;k of us, is not &s;ilver or gold, or any of our outward &s;ub&s;tance, or that we would put our&s;elves to any co&s;t, or do any thing that will be likely to expo&s;e us to any remarkable trouble, difficulty or &s;uffering in our outward intere&s;t, but only that we would, help together with them, by our prayers to God, for the greate&s;t mercy
<PB N="313" REF="026594_0314_0FD0B418A70B5898">in the world, and that a mercy which as much concerns us as them, for the glory of their Lord and ours, for the great advancement of our common intere&s;t and happine&s;s, and the happine&s;s of our fellow-creatures through all nations; a mercy, which, at this day e&s;pe|cially, there is great need of; a mercy, which we, in this land, do &s;tand in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cular need of; a mercy, which the word of God re|quires us to make the &s;ubject-matter of our prayers, above all other mercies, and gives us more encouragement to pray earne&s;tly and unitedly to him for, than any other mer|cy; and a mercy, which the providence of God towards the world of mankind, at this day, does loudly call the people of God to pray for. I think we cannot rea&s;onably doubt but that the&s;e mini&s;ters have acted a part be|coming di&s;ciples of the great Me&s;&s;iah, and mini&s;ters of his kingdom, and have done the will of God, and according to his word, in &s;etting forward &s;uch an affair at this day, and in propo&s;ing it to us; and therefore I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, whether we &s;hall not really &s;in again&s;t God, in refu&s;ing to com|ply with their propo&s;al and reque&s;t, or in neglecting it, and turning it by, with but lit|tle
<PB N="314" REF="026594_0315_0FD0B442A5F75470">notice and attention, therein di&s;regard|ing that which is truly a call of God to us.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters that make this propo&s;al to us, are no &s;eparati&s;ts or &s;chi&s;matics, promo|ters of no public di&s;orders, nor of any wild|ne&s;s or extravagance in matters of religion, but are quiet and peaceable members and mini&s;ters of the church of Scotland, that have lamented the late divi&s;ions and breach|es of that church. If any &s;hall &s;ay, that they are under no advantage to judge of their character, but mu&s;t take it on tru&s;t from o|thers, becau&s;e they conceal their names; in an&s;wer to this, I would &s;ay, That I pre&s;ume no &s;ober per&s;on will &s;ay that he has any rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect them, to be any other than gentlemen of hone&s;t intention. Be&s;ure there is no appearance of any thing el&s;e, but an upright de&s;ign in their propo&s;al, and that they have not mentioned their names, is an argument of it. It may well be pre&s;umed, from the manner of their expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves, in the memorial it&s;elf, they conceal|ed their names from that, which, perhaps, may be called an exce&s;s of mode&s;ty, chu&s;ing to be at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from appear|ing to &s;et forth them&s;elves to the view of the world, as the heads of a great affair, and the
<PB N="315" REF="026594_0316_0FD0B41A2780D6B8">fir&s;t projectors and movers of &s;omething ex|traordinary, that they de&s;ire &s;hould become general, and that God's people, in various di&s;tant parts of the world, &s;hould agree in. And therefore, they are moreover careful to tell us, that they do not propo&s;e the af|fair, as now &s;etting it on foot, but as a thing already &s;et on foot, and do not tell us who fir&s;t projected and moved it. The propo&s;al is made to us in a very proper and prudent manner, with all appearance of Chri&s;tian mode&s;ty and &s;incerity, and with a very pru|dent guard again&s;t and thing that looks like &s;uper&s;tition, or what&s;oever might entangle a tender con&s;cience, and far from any appear|ance of a de&s;ign to promote any particular party or denomination of Chri&s;tians, in op|po&s;ition to others, but with all appearance to the contrary, in their charitable reque&s;t, that none would, by any means, conceive of any &s;uch thing to be in their view, and that all, of every denomination and opinion con|cerning the late religious commotions, would join with them, in &s;eeking the common inte|re&s;t of the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and, there|fore, I think, none can be in the way of their duty, in neglecting a propo&s;al in it&s;elf excel|lent, and that which they have rea&s;on to
<PB N="316" REF="026594_0317_0FD0B444687DB130">think is made with upright intentions, mere|ly becau&s;e the propo&s;ers mode&s;tly conceal their names. I do not &s;ee how any &s;erious per&s;on, that has an ill opinion of late reli|gious &s;tirs, can have any colour of rea&s;on to refu&s;e a compliance with this propo&s;al, on that account; the more di&s;orders, extrava|gancies and delu&s;ions of the devil have late|ly prevailed, the more need have we to pray earne&s;tly to God, for his Holy Spirit, to pro|mote true religion, in oppo&s;ition to the grand deceiver, and all his works; and the more &s;uch prayer, as is propo&s;ed, is an&s;wered, the more effectually will all that is contrary to &s;ober and pure religion be extirpated and exploded</P>
<P>One would think that every one who fa|vours the du&s;t of Zion, when he hears that God is &s;tirring up a con&s;iderable number of his mini&s;ters and people, to unite in extra|ordinary prayer, for the revival of religion and advancement of his kingdom, &s;hould greatly rejoice on this occa&s;ion. If we lay to heart the pre&s;ent calamities of the church of Chri&s;t, and long for that ble&s;&s;ed altera|tion which God has promi&s;ed, one would think it &s;hould be natural to rejoice at the appearance of &s;omething in &s;o dark a day,
<PB N="317" REF="026594_0318_0FD0B41BB5DCDD38">which is &s;o promi&s;ing a token. Would not our friends that were lately in captivity in Canada, who earne&s;tly longed for deliver|ance, have rejoiced to have heard of any thing that &s;eemed to forebode the approach of their redemption? And particularly may we not &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch of them as were religi|ous per&s;ons, would greatly have rejoiced to have under&s;tood that there was &s;tirred up in God's people an extraordinary &s;pirit of pray|er for their redemption? And I do not know why it would not be as natural for us to re|joice at the like hopeful token of the redemp|tion of Zion, if we made her intere&s;t our own, and preferred Jeru&s;alem above our chief joy.</P>
<P>If we are indeed called of God to comply with the propo&s;al now made to us, then let me be&s;eech all that do &s;incerely love the in|tere&s;t of real Chri&s;tianity, not with&s;tanding any diver&s;ity of opinion, and former di&s;|putes, now to unite in this affair, with one heart and voice&mdash;and <HI>let us go &s;peedily to pray before the Lord.</HI> There is no need that one &s;hould wait for another. If we can get others, that are our neighbours, to join with us, and &s;o can conveniently &s;pend the quar|terly &s;ea&s;ons with praying &s;ocieties, this is de&s;irable; but if not, why &s;hould we wholly
<PB N="318" REF="026594_0319_0FD0B445C6F718A8">neglect the duty propo&s;ed? Why &s;hould not we perform it by our&s;elves, uniting in heart and practice, as far as we are able, with tho&s;e who, in di&s;tant places, are engaged in that duty at that time?</P>
<P>If it be agreeable to the mind and will of God, that we &s;hould comply with the memo|rial, by praying for the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, in the manner therein propo&s;ed, then doubtle&s;s it is the duty of all to comply with the memorial, in that re&s;pect al&s;o, viz. in endeavouring, as far as in us lies, to pro|mote others joining in &s;uch prayer, and to render this union and agreement as exten|&s;ive as may be. Private Chri&s;tians may have many advantages and opportunities for this; but e&s;pecially mini&s;ters, ina&s;much as they not only are by office over&s;eers of whole congregations of God's people, and their guides in matters of religion, but ordinarily have a far more exten&s;ive acquaintance and influence abroad, than private Chri&s;tians in common have.</P>

It is very apparent from the word of God, that God is wont often to try the faith and patience of his people, when cry|ing to him for &s;ome great and important mercy, by with-holding the mercy &s;ought, for a &s;ea&s;on, and not only &s;o, but at fir&s;t to cau&s;e an increa&s;e of dark appearances, and yet, without fail, at la&s;t, to &s;ucceed tho&s;e who continue in&s;tant in prayer with all per&s;ever|ance, and will not let God go except he ble&s;|&s;es.

Perhaps &s;ome that appear forward to engage, may begin to think the time long, before the &s;e|ven years are out, and may account it a dull &s;tory, to go on, for &s;o long a time, praying in this extraordinary method, while all yet continues dark and dead, without any dawn|ings

But yet, at the &s;ame time, I hope, God's people, that unite in this a|greement, will &s;ee &s;ome tokens for good, be|fore the&s;e &s;even years are out, that &s;hall give them to &s;ee, that God has not &s;aid to the &s;eed of Jacob&mdash;Seek ye me in vain; and &s;hall &s;erve greatly to animate and encou|rage them to go on in united prayers for the

<P>Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy a|po&s;tles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN all the calamities which it plea&s;es God to bring upon his enemies, or upon the enemies of his church, all holy beings have cau&s;e to rejoice. The ground of their joy, in &s;uch events, however awful to the &s;uffer|ers, is founded in the rea&s;on and nature of things as well as in the expre&s;s appointment and call of God.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of God in heaven, and the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and of his church on the earth are one and the &s;ame: and &s;o far as either the former or the latter, or both unitedly, may be employed, in their u&s;ual methods of ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion, in counteracting, and in overturning
<PB N="328" REF="026594_0326_0FD0B448A7AC4BB8">the purpo&s;es of the Grand Adver&s;ary or of his in&s;truments; in the &s;ame degree may the &s;truggle be &s;tiled a common cau&s;e, or a ge|neral war. The enemies of God are the e|nemies of his church, and they who &s;eek the overthrow of the latter, would, if po&s;&s;ible, dethrone the former. On this account, there|fore, it is, that all holy beings, whether in the heaven of heavens, on high, or whether in the heavens of the Chri&s;tian church, (for &s;o, in prophetic &s;tile, the word &s;ometimes &s;ignifies,) are called upon to rejoice at the calamities which God, in judgment for their &s;ins, brings on his enemies, and on the ene|mies of his Zion.</P>
<P>All holy beings have cau&s;e to rejoice in the downfall of the wicked, as &s;uch a di&s;a&s;|ter, under the management of heaven, may tend to the upbuilding of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of the truth in the world. By &s;uch events victory is, renewedly, a&s;cribed to God. The faith and hope of the pious are revived and confirmed.&mdash;That &s;uch effects, by &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters upon the wicked, have been produced, the &s;criptures plainly teach. The dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wning of the old world, and the de&s;truc|tion of Pharaoh and his ho&s;t are in&s;tances in point. In view of the latter, <HI>&s;ang Mo&s;es

The Lord is my &s;trength and &s;ong, and he is become my &s;alvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.</HI></P>
<P>Not only is the confidence of the righte|ous maintained by &s;uch di&s;plays of vindic|tive power, but the &s;ame events load, with increa&s;ing danger, the intere&s;ts of Satan and of the wicked in general.</P>
<P>To revive the intere&s;ts of truth and of grace&mdash;to &s;upport the cau&s;e of God in the bo&s;oms of the righteous, and to accumulate the degrees of danger, apprehen&s;ion and fi|nal de&s;truction, on the part of the wicked, have no doubt been important, if not lead|ing objects to be accompli&s;hed, in all the denunciations and executions which, in all ages, have been, in a higher or le&s;s degree, emptied forth upon the wicked, from the vials of the divine indignation.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame important ob|jects, a call is i&s;&s;ued, on a mighty and &s;olemn

<P>And will a very gracious God &s;o enlight|en the mind, both of the &s;peaker and of the hearers, that truths may be opened, impre&s;|&s;ions made, and effects wrought an&s;werable to the nature and import of &s;o &s;olemn and momentous a &s;ubject.&mdash;I am,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;hew who it is over who&s;e de&s;truc|tion, or downfall, all holy beings are called upon to rejoice.</P>
<P>For his knowledge we mu&s;t repair to the fir&s;t and &s;econd ver&s;es of the context. <HI>And after the&s;e things,</HI> &s;aith the in&s;pired apo&s;tle, <HI>I &s;aw another angel come down from heaven,
<PB N="331" REF="026594_0329_0FD0B42626DB3460">having great power, and the earth was light|ened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a &s;trong voice, &s;aying,</HI> BABYLON THE GREAT IS FALLEN, IS FALLEN.</P>
<P>It is very generally, if not unanimou&s;ly, agreed by Prote&s;tant writers, that by Baby|lon, as u&s;ed in this place, you are to under|&s;tand the exten&s;ive, once triumphant, and per&s;ecuting power of anti-chri&s;tian Papal Rome, &s;tiled BABYLON, becau&s;e there are &s;o many appendages to this idolatrous power, which &s;o nearly re&s;emble, and &s;o exactly an&s;wer the prophetic de&s;cription of Baby|lon, of the Chaldees&mdash;the inveterate the pow|erful, and, for a &s;ea&s;on, the &s;ucce&s;sful ene|my of the people of God, in ancient time.</P>
<P>Figures of &s;peech, e&s;pecially in the pro|phetic parts, are very frequent in the &s;crip|tures. Indeed, almo&s;t the whole of this book of <HI>the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t which God gave unto him, to &s;hew unto his &s;ervants things which mu&s;t &s;hortly come to pa&s;s,</HI> is made up of figures. Sometimes, le&s;t the figure &s;hould be unintelligible, the angel &s;ent to commu|nicate the very intere&s;ting intelligence of this invaluable book, explains the figure.&mdash; And &s;ometimes the prophetic herald gives a different view of the &s;ame object in differ|ent
<PB N="332" REF="026594_0330_0FD0B44BAB3CE0D0">figures. Of this method we have an ex|ample in the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P>Papal Rome, here &s;tiled BABYLON THE GREAT, in the chapter preceding is called, becau&s;e of her idolatrous practices, and be|cau&s;e of her for&s;aking her original faithful Lord and Hu&s;band&mdash;the GREAT WHORE: And that it might be known to be the &s;ame power, as is here de&s;cribed, the word Baby|lon is annexed or interwoven with the o|ther characters of this my&s;tical harlot. This fact will be yet more clear if you li&s;ten to the te&s;timony it&s;elf. <HI>So he carried me away in the &s;pirit into the wilderne&s;s: and I &s;aw a woman &s;it upon a &s;carlet-coloured bea&s;t, full of names of bla&s;phemy, having &s;even heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and &s;carlet-colour, and decked with gold, and precious &s;tones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abomina|tions and &s;ilthine&s;s of her fornication. And upon her forehead was a name written,</HI> MYS|TERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MO|THER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</P>
<P>In &s;upporting the allu&s;ion, or in running the parallel between ancient heatheni&s;h and modern anti-chri&s;tian Papal Babylon, you
<PB N="333" REF="026594_0331_0FD0B427A8E281C8">will permit, that I but touch upon the dif|ferent branches of &s;imilarity, leaving the more full illu&s;tration to be &s;upplied by your own recollection and &s;tudy.</P>
<P>As in the prophetic writings the words Jeru&s;alem, Zion, the Temple of the living God, &amp;c. are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;tate of the church under the Jewi&s;h, &s;o the &s;ame words are &s;ometimes applied to expre&s;s the &s;tate and character of the church under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. On the other hand, as Sodom, Egypt and Babylon were names given to the enemies of God, and of his church, in ancient time, &s;o, under the &s;ame names, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are &s;et forth and de|&s;cribed as to exi&s;t in later times.</P>
<P>All the&s;e dark &s;hades of national charac|ter, and many more, did time allow, might be proved to be, with ju&s;tice, applicable to this anti-chri&s;tian power of Papal Rome.&mdash; To Sodom this power may be likened for her &s;in, and to Egypt for her darkne&s;s, ido|latry and oppre&s;&s;ion. And, without doubt, by the angel of God, in his addre&s;s to St. John on the &s;ubject of the &s;laughter of the witne&s;&s;es, the&s;e dark &s;hades are applied to this tyrannical dominion. <HI>And their dead bodies &s;hall lie in the &s;treet of the great city,
<PB N="334" REF="026594_0332_0FD0B44DC29291C0">which &s;piritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where, al&s;o, our Lord was crucified.</HI> On the&s;e words, &s;aith an approved commentator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But kit in loco.</NOTE>&mdash; <Q>The place where this was done is &s;tiled Sodom and Egypt, and the <HI>great city where our Lord was crucified;</HI> which, if literally under&s;tood, &s;ignifies Jeru&s;alem, but if my&s;tically under&s;tood, ROME, or the Roman empire.</Q>&mdash;And no one, I may add, will &s;uppo&s;e it is perverting the prophetic emblem, if it be applied, &s;olely, to Rome; e&s;pecially, if it be recollected, that as Jeru|&s;alem was the head of the Jewi&s;h, &s;o Rome profe&s;&s;es to be the head of the Chri&s;tian em|pire; and al&s;o, that the once crucifying of our Lord at Jeru&s;alem, is but a faint emblem of the thou&s;and crucifixions he has &s;ince un|dergone in the multiplied per&s;ecutions and tortures of the members of his my&s;tical bo|dy; and, I may add, which he &s;till under|goes in the daily offerings, the my&s;tical &s;er|vices, the &s;uper&s;titious ma&s;&s;es of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>Hear, al&s;o, to this point, the te&s;timony of a late very re&s;pectable writer on the &s;ubject of prophecy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Langdon in loco.</NOTE> <Q>As to the great city, men|tioned
<PB N="335" REF="026594_0333_0FD0B4292698AD20">under the figurative names of So|dom and Egypt, and compared al&s;o to Je|&s;alem, where our Lord was crucified, we &s;hall find by following vi&s;ions that Rome, with its empire, is meant. It is called So|dom, on account of the abominable crimes committed in it, Egypt, on account of abounding &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, and the cruel bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge in which it holds the people of God: And it is compared to Jeru&s;alem, being &s;aid to be the city where our Lord was crucified; becau&s;e while it pretended to be an holy city, it had killed the prophets and &s;aints, and crucified Chri&s;t afre&s;h in his members. Here it may be more e&s;pecially ob&s;erved, that as in the beginning of the chapter the temple is the emblem of the Chri&s;tian church, that city, with its empire, in which the church is com|prehended, may very properly be compar|ed to Jeru&s;alem, the city in which the Jew|i&s;h temple &s;tood: And as our Lord was crucified within the juri&s;diction of the Ro|man empire, and by the Roman authori|ty, and the Papal empire has &s;ucceeded to the other, and claims an equal extent, there is a propriety in &s;aying that our Lord was crucified in the great city Rome, con&s;i|dered
<PB N="336" REF="026594_0334_0FD0B44EA796A8A8">in connexion with the empire of which it is the capital.</Q></P>
<P>Having laid this foundation as to the u&s;e and application of prophetic figures, to which much might be added, were it nece&s;&s;ary, the way is plain to proceed with my &s;ubject, in an attempt to &s;hew, that by BABYLON THE GREAT, who&s;e fall is predicted in the text, is meant the pre&s;ent anti-chri&s;tian power of Papal Rome.</P>
<P>This fact will, at once, appear mo&s;t pal|pably evident, if, with attention, you are plea&s;ed to follow me in a con&s;ideration of the &s;everal articles of analogy, between anci|ent and modern Babylon, de&s;igned to ju&s;tify the prophetic allu&s;ion.</P>

<P>The heathen per&s;ecutions had been very dreadful; but now per|&s;ecution, by the church of Rome, was improved, and &s;tudied, and cultivated as an art or &s;cience.

It is difficult to con|ceive, that if God had delivered the world entirely into the Devil's hands, (as Satan once pretended) that his ingenuity and malice could have invented any thing more dete&s;table and &s;hocking. In fact, there is &s;carcely a method that could delayer pervert ju&s;tice, but they have adopted it in their forms; nor does there &s;eem a po&s;&s;ible method of torture but they have invented and repeatedly exerci&s;ed. The reader, who&s;e nerves can bear &s;uch r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">terated &s;cenes of cruelty, may read Baker's Hi&s;tory of the Inqui&s;ition&mdash;the Hi&s;tory of the Inqui&s;ition at Goa, written by a Papi&s;t, and &s;imilar works. But to &s;hew how far it is po&s;&s;ible for human nature to go, let him read the following extract from a &s;ermon preached at E|vora, on occa&s;ion of one of the mo&s;t horrid &s;cenes the &s;un ever be|held, an <HI>auto de fo,</HI> when they born or rather roa&s;t heretics (as they call them) alive, from a principle of religion.

For, not to mention other outrageous &s;laughters and barbarities, the croi&s;ades again&s;t the Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, the murders committed by the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, the ma&s;&s;acres in France and Ireland, will probably amount to above ten times the number of all the Chri&s;tians &s;lain in all the ten per&s;ecutions of the Roman emperors put together."</P>
<P>"By means of the&s;e and other cruel per&s;ecutions, the Prote&s;t|ant religion was in a great mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in Bohemia, and the Palatinate, and Hungary, which before were Prote&s;tant countries. Thus was fulfilled what was foretold of the little horn." <HI>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three &s;ell, even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that &s;pake great things, who&s;e look was more &s;tout than his fellows: I behold and the &s;ame horn made war with the &s;aints, and prevailed again&s;t them.</HI> And what was foretold of the bea&s;t having &s;even heads and ten horns. <HI>And it was given unto him to make war with the &s;aints, and to overcome them; and pow|er was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o Holland, and the other low countries, were, for many years, a &s;cene of nothing but the mo&s;t affecting and amazing cruelties, being deluged with the blood of Prote&s;tants, under the mercile&s;s hands of the Spaniards, to whom they were then in &s;ubjection.&mdash; But in this per&s;ecution the Devil in a great mea&s;ure failed of his purpo&s;e, as it i&s;&s;ued in a great part of the Netherlands ca&s;ting off the Spani&s;h yoke, and &s;etting up a wealthy and powerful Prote&s;t|ant &s;tate, to the great defence of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>France al&s;o is another country which, &s;ince the Reformation, in &s;ome re&s;pects, perhaps, more than any other, has been a &s;cene of dreadful cruelties &s;uffered by the Prote&s;tants there. After many cruelties had been exerci&s;ed towards the Prote&s;tants in that king|dom, there was begun a per&s;ecution of them in the year 1571, in the reign of Charles the IX. king of France.</P>
<P>It began with a cruel ma&s;&s;acre, wherein &s;eventy thou&s;and Pro|te&s;tants were &s;lain in a few days time, as the king boa&s;ted; and in all this per&s;ecution, he &s;lew, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, three hundred thou&s;and martyrs. And it is reckoned, that about this time, with|in thirty years, there were martyred in this kingdom, for the Pro|te&s;tant religion, thirty-nine princes, one hundred and forty-eight counts, two hundred and thirty-four barons, one hundred and forty-&s;even thou&s;and five hundred and eighteen gentlemen, and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and of the common people.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;ian ma&s;&s;acre was aggravated with &s;everal circum&s;tan|ces of wantonne&s;s and treachery; but we hope that the above num|bers are exaggerated. Thuanus, their own hi&s;torian, reckons thirty thou&s;and lives de&s;troyed in this &s;laughter; but Prote&s;tant anthors &s;eem to have rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing them not le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and in the whole. But the mo&s;t horrid circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory is, that when the news of this event reached Rome, Pope Gregory XIII. in&s;tituted the mo&s;t &s;olemn rejoicings, giving thanks to Almighty God for this glorious victory!!!&mdash;An in|&s;tance that has no parallel, even in hell.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e per&s;ecutions were, for exqui&s;ite cruelty, far ex|ceeded by tho&s;e which followed in the reign of Lewis XIV. which, indeed, are &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed all others that ever have been; and being long continued by rea&s;on of the long reign of that king, almo&s;t wholly extirpated the Prote&s;tant religion out of that king|dom, where had been before a multitude of famous Prote&s;tant churches all over the country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The Per&s;ecution under Lewis XIV.</HI>&mdash;This followed the re|vocation of the Edict of Nantes, A. D. 1685. The following ex|tract is taken from a French work of reputation.</P>
<P>"The troopers, &s;oldiers and dragoons went into the Prote&s;tants' hou&s;es, where they marred and defaced their hou&s;ehold &s;tuff, broke their looking-gla&s;&s;es, and other uten&s;ils and ornaments, let their wine run about their cellars, and threw about their corn, and &s;poilet it. And as to tho&s;e things which they could not de|&s;troy in this manner, &s;uch as furniture of beds, linen, wearing ap|parel, plate, &amp;c. they carried them to the market place, and &s;old them to the Je&s;uits and other Roman Catholics. By the&s;e means the Prote&s;tants in Montaubon alone were, in four or five days, &s;tripped of above a million of money. But this was not the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>"They turned the dining-rooms of gentlemen into &s;tables for their hor&s;es, and treated the owners of the hou&s;es where they quartered with the highe&s;t indignity and cruelty, la&s;hing them a|bout from one to another, day and night, without intermi&s;&s;ion, not &s;uffering them to eat or drink; and when they began to &s;ink under the fatigue and pains they had undergone, they laid them on a bed, and when they thought them &s;omewhat recovered, made them ri&s;e, and repeated the &s;ame tortures. When they &s;aw the blood and &s;weat run down their faces and other parts of their bo|dies, they &s;luiced them with water; and putting over their heads kettle-drums, turned up&s;ide down, they made a continual din upon them till tho&s;e unhappy creatures lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es. When one party of the&s;e tormentors were weary they were relieved by ano|ther, who practi&s;ed the &s;ame cruelties with fre&s;h vigor.</P>
<P>At Negrepli&s;&s;e, a town near Montaubon, they hung up I&s;aac Favin, a Prote&s;tant citizen of that place, by his arm-pits, and tor|mented him a whole night by pinching and tearing off his fle&s;h with pincers. They made a great fire round a boy about twelve years old, who, with hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, cried out&mdash; "My God, help me!"&mdash;And when they found the youth re&s;olved to die rather than renounce his religion, they &s;natched him from the &s;ire ju&s;t as he was on the point of being burnt.</P>
<P>"In &s;everal places the &s;oldiers applied red hot irons to the hands and feet of men, and the brea&s;ts of women. At Nantes they hung up &s;everal women and maids by their feet, and others by their arm-pits, and thus expo&s;ed them to public view &s;tark-naked. They bound mothers that gave &s;uck to po&s;ts, and let their &s;ucking infants lie langui&s;hing in their &s;ight for &s;everal days and nights, crying, mourning and ga&s;ping for life. Some they bound before a great &s;ire, and, being half roa&s;ted, let them go&mdash;a puni&s;h|ment wor&s;e than death. Amid&s;t a thou&s;and hideous cries, and a thou&s;and bla&s;phemies, they hung up men and women by the hair, and &s;ome by their feet, on hooks in chimneys, and &s;moaked them with wi&s;ps of wet hay till they were &s;uffocated. They tied &s;ome under the arms with ropes, and plunged them again and again in|to wells. They bound others like criminals, put them to the tor|ture, and with a funnel filled them with wine, till the fumes of it took away their rea&s;on, when they made them &s;ay they con&s;ented to be Catholics. They &s;tripped them naked, and, after a thou&s;|and indignities, &s;tuck them with pins and needles from bead to foot. They cut and &s;la&s;hed them with knives, and &s;ometimes with red-hot pincers took hold of them by the no&s;e and other parts of the body, and dragged them about the rooms till they made them promi&s;e to be Catholics, or till the cries of the&s;e mi&s;erable wretch|es, calling upon God for help, forced them to let them go. They beat them with &s;taves, and thus brui&s;ed, and with broken bones, dragged them to church, where their forced pre&s;ence was taken for an abjuration. In &s;ome places they tied fathers and hu&s;bands to their bed-po&s;ts, and, before their eyes, ravaged their wives and daughters with impunity. They blew up men and women with bellows till they bur&s;t them. If any, to e&s;cape the&s;e barbarities, endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight, they pur&s;ued them into the fields and woods, where they &s;hot them like wild bea&s;ts, and prohibited them from departing the kingdom, (a cruelty never practi&s;ed by Nero or Diocle&s;ian) upon pain of confi&s;cation of ef|fects, the gallies, the la&s;h, and perpetual impri&s;onment; in&s;omuch that the pri&s;ons of the &s;ea port towns were crammed with men, women and children, who endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight from this dreadful per&s;ecution. With the&s;e &s;cenes of de&s;o|lation and horror, the popi&s;h clergy fea&s;ted their eyes, and made only a matter of laughter and &s;port of them."</P>
<P><HI>Other cruelties.</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ide the Prote&s;tant blood &s;hed in the&s;e per|&s;ecutions, Popery has to an&s;wer for the lives of millions of Jews, Mahometans, and barbarians. When the Moors conquered Spain in the eighth century, they allowed the Chri&s;tians the free exer|ci&s;e of their religion. But in the fifteenth century, when the ta|bles were turned, and Ferdinand &s;ubdued the Mori&s;coes, (the de|&s;cendants of the above Moors) many hundred thou&s;ands of them were forced to be baptized, or burnt, ma&s;&s;acred, or bani&s;hed, and their children &s;old for &s;laves; be&s;ides an innumerable multitude of Jews, who &s;hared the &s;ame cruelties, chiefly by means of the infer|nal Inqui&s;ition. A wor&s;e &s;laughter, if po&s;&s;ible, was made among the natives of Spani&s;h America, where fifteen millions are &s;aid to have been &s;acrificed to the genius of Popery in the cour&s;e of about forty years. Well, therefore, might the in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ay, that at my&s;tic Babylon's de&s;truction&mdash;<HI>In her was found the blood of prophets, and of &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth!</HI> Rev. xviii. 24&mdash;[See Edwards's Hi&s;tory of Redemption, with notes, page 452, 459, of the London, or new American edition.]</P></NOTE> Thus it was given to the bea&s;t to make war with the &s;aints, and to overcome them.</P></NOTE></P></NOTE> A peru&s;al of the hi&s;tories of the Romi&s;h per&s;ecu|tion, and their courts of inqui&s;ition, will give that idea, which a few words cannot expre&s;s.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>During this bondage it is that the TWO WITNESSES&mdash;the <HI>few</HI> faithful, who, in every age, have te&s;tified to the truth; (as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed) but if &s;o, there may be al&s;o an al|lu&s;ion, and perhaps a primary one, to the TWO OLIVE TREES of the prophet's vi&s;ion, <HI>the anointed ones that &s;tand by the Lord of the whole earth.</HI></P>
<P>The olive tree afforded light from its fat|ne&s;s, and nouri&s;hment from its fruit. Un|der&s;tanding, therefore, the purport of the TWO WITNESSES, as explained by the an|gel, to be the two OLIVE TREES, and the TWO CANDLESTICKS, <HI>&s;tanding before the God of the earth,</HI> I am rather inclined to think, that they have a more exten&s;ive, my&s;|tical, and important meaning than what they have been generally under&s;tood to imply. If the olive trees and candle&s;ticks were an emblem of &s;piritual and divine communica|tions during their &s;tanding in the Jewi&s;h, what &s;hould hinder the &s;ame application whil&s;t they &s;tand in the Chri&s;tian church?</P>
<P>As the gifts and graces &s;hed down upon the mini&s;ters of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and upon his churches, after his a&s;cen&s;ion, were &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="345" REF="026594_0343_0FD0B403AAB90EB8">to have been typified or pre&s;igured by the anointing and common oil of the &s;anctuary; &s;o the olive tree as giving light and heat, and, I may add, nouri&s;hment too, was found in the u&s;age and appointment of heaven, no unbecoming repre&s;entation or emblem of tho&s;e &s;piritual communications which were then &s;hed upon the true wor|&s;hippers, and which will ever be continued as long as Chri&s;t is the vine, or true olive, and his people the needy branches.</P>
<P>May we not then &s;uppo&s;e, that by the&s;e TWO OLIVE TREES and the TWO CANDLE|STICKS, <HI>&s;tanding before the God of the earth,</HI> is meant the <HI>&s;ources</HI> of divine and &s;piritual &s;upplies to his church, the <HI>medium</HI> of com|munication, or methods of <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>o|pen exhibition;</HI> or &s;hall we &s;ay, that the em|blem may partake a little of each, and &s;tand a lively figure of them all?</P>
<P>If you a&s;k how this interpretation can con|&s;i&s;t with the epithet, with their being called <HI>witne&s;&s;es,</HI> it may be an&s;wered, they are ju&s;tly and literally &s;o to be &s;tiled. Are not the word of God preached, and his ordinances admini&s;tered, by his faithful mini&s;ters, pro|perly to be &s;tiled WITNESSES for God?&mdash;

<P>With this interpretation agrees well the idea of their prophe&s;ying <HI>in &s;ackcloth;</HI> for no one can pretend, but the admini&s;tration of the word and wor&s;hip of God, in the Ro|mi&s;h church, is &s;o beclouded by ignorance, &s;tiled darkne&s;s; by &s;uper&s;tition and error, and by the mini&s;try of a corrupt prie&s;thood, as to lay ju&s;t foundation to &s;ay, that the wit|ne&s;&s;es, with this interpretation, are empha|tically prophe&s;ying in &s;ackcloth.</P>

<P>And if any &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that the pre&s;ent reigning per&s;ecuting infidel power, now waging war again&s;t all revealed religion, in France, is likely to be the <HI>death</HI> of the&s;e &s;ame witne&s;&s;es, who, for a long time, have already been made to prophe&s;y in &s;ack|cloth, perhaps the opinion may find &s;upport from the declaration of the angel: <HI>And when they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their te&s;timony, the bea&s;t that a&s;cendeth out of the bottomle&s;s pit, &s;hall make war again&s;t them, and &s;hall over|come them, and kill them.</HI> If this interpre|tation be true, the mourning witne&s;&s;es are now &s;uffering death in tho&s;e parts of my&s;ti|cal Babylon, where the exi&s;ting exterminat|ing power has prevailed.</P>
<P>Did time allow, and was the pre&s;ent a
<PB N="348" REF="026594_0346_0FD0B4588D878BF8">proper place in the order of my di&s;cour&s;e, I might expound upon the whole chapter, and ea&s;ily reconcile any expre&s;&s;ions which, at fir&s;t view, might appear intricate, or doubtful, to the &s;pirit of this interpretation. Suffice it, for the pre&s;ent, to &s;ay, that with this in|terpretation agrees well the declaration made re&s;pecting the injury the&s;e witne&s;&s;es are able to do their enemies. <HI>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies.</HI> And of no|thing &s;hort of the admini&s;tration of Heaven can it be &s;aid: <HI>The&s;e have power to &s;hut hea|ven, that it rain not in the days of their pro|phecy.</HI> And of nothing &s;hort of this can it be &s;aid&mdash;<HI>They have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to &s;mite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</HI> And very cor|re&s;pondent to the death of the witne&s;&s;es, and to the lying of their dead bodies in the <HI>&s;treet of the great city,</HI> is the death, the broken and demoli&s;hed &s;tate of external religion in tho&s;e parts of Papal Rome, in which the pre&s;ent exterminating power hath prevail|ed.

<P>And over the death of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es it is, that the men of this world <HI>&s;hall rejoice, and make merry, and &s;hall &s;end gifts one to another; becau&s;e the&s;e two prophets torment|ed them that dwelt on the earth.</HI></P>
<P>To the re&s;urrection and final exaltation of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es well applies the ver&s;es &s;ucceeding. <HI>And after three days and an half, the &s;pirit of life from God entered into them, and they &s;tood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them that &s;aw them.

<P>And to conclude the argument, we are always to remember, that no interpretation of this my&s;tical pa&s;&s;age can be allowed, which does not grant to the witne&s;&s;es an exi&s;tence, and a te&s;timony during the whole term of the anti-chri&s;tian dominion. <HI>And I will give,</HI> or appoint, <HI>unto my two witne&s;&s;es, and they &s;hall prophe&s;y a thou&s;and two hundred and three&s;core days, clothed in &s;ackcloth.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay, this interpretation does not altogether accord with what the Editor has &s;uffered to be pub|li&s;hed in a preceding part of this volume; and that he is charge|able with inaccuracy, in this particular; it may &s;uffice to an&s;wer, that the pre&s;ent being an interpretation &s;o far new, (though al|ready two years in manu&s;cript) that the Editor could not, until within a few days, warrant him&s;elf in preaching, or in publi&s;hing the &s;entiment; therefore permitted the former interpretation to pa&s;s,&mdash;which, however, with &s;ome abatement for the time in which it was written, mu&s;t be allowed to be of no &s;mall te&s;timony to the truth, taken in a general and exten&s;ive point of view.</NOTE></P>

<P>If Daniel de&s;cribes the kingdom in which the little horn was to ari&s;e, by &s;uch emblems as can belong to none but the Roman, the &s;ame emblems, to pre-figure the kingdom of the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet, are al&s;o em|ployed by St. John, from whom we farther learn, that his appropriated place of re&s;idence is the city of Rome.</P>
<P>If Daniel re&s;trains the &s;overeignty of this Roman power to the European or we&s;tern part of the empire, after it was divided into ten &s;hares, the &s;ame re&s;triction is intimated in one of the epi&s;tles of St. Paul, and is more explicitly declared by the beloved di&s;ciple in the Apocalyp&s;e. If Daniel repre&s;ents the nature of this u&s;urped dominion as different from any other, St. Paul and St. John in|&s;truct us, that this diver&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in its be|ing &s;piritual, not a civil dominion, which is
<PB N="363" REF="026594_0361_0FD07FE183CF76C0">therefore to be &s;ought for, <HI>not</HI> in the Heath|en, but in <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Rome.

<P>And la&s;tly, if the demolition of this ex|traordinary polity be denounced by the pro|phet of the Old Te&s;tament, the &s;ame inte|re&s;ting event is promi&s;ed by the two apo&s;|tles of the New.

<P>Having, thus, con&s;idered who it is over who&s;e de&s;truction all holy beings are called to rejoice, and &s;aid &s;omething of the <HI>origin, continuance,</HI> and expected downfall of this power, I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of this awful di&s;|a&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy apo&s;tles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</HI></P>
<P>If we confine our re&s;earches after the pro|curing cau&s;e of this di&s;a&s;ter to the appenda|ges of Babylon, we &s;hall find it in <HI>her own guilt.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me to point out her guilt as hint|ed at in the chapter from which my text is taken.</P>
<P N="1">1. Babylon is charged with the extent of her idolatry.</P>
<P><HI>The kings of the earth have committed for|nication with her;</HI> that is, have been em|braced by her idolatrous communion&mdash;unit|ed with her in a general apo&s;tacy from God.</P>
<P N="2">2. She is charged with a &s;elfi&s;h, mercena|ry
<PB N="372" REF="026594_0370_0FD0B46B35963F18">&s;pirit in the concerns of her admini&s;tra|tion. <HI>The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</HI> "By the merchants under&s;tand all &s;uch as trade in Babylon's wares; her plea&s;ing and co&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly wares of pardons, ma&s;&s;es and indul|gencies, by which &s;o many are enriched; as well as tho&s;e who trade in images, and in all the co&s;tly trappings of their idolatrous wor|ship, and e&s;pecially in the &s;ouls of men."</P>
<P N="3">3. She is &s;poken of as <HI>contaminating</HI> and endangering tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arried within her li|mits, expo&s;ing the people of God to be be|witched by her &s;orceries. <HI>And I heard an|other voice from heaven, &s;aying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P>My brethren, doth not this &s;olemn decree, for the &s;eparation of God's people from the &s;ins and abominations of Babylon, preach to us in the&s;e United States, even to us, who inhabit this a&s;ylum of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, to be|ware of the habits, cu&s;toms, influence and inchanting prerogatives of tho&s;e who are &s;leeing before the vengeance of an incen&s;ed God? <HI>Be not partakers of her &s;ins, that ye re|ceive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P>This caution is &s;upported by the annun|ciation
<PB N="373" REF="026594_0371_0FD0B3FC25547CF0">of the angel of God. <HI>And there fol|lowed another angel, &s;aying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, becau&s;e &s;he made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, &s;aying with a loud voice, If any man wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the &s;ame &s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture in|to the cup of his indignation: and he &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone in the pre|&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The guilt of Babylon is &s;poken of as &s;ending forth a cry: <HI>For her &s;ins have reach|ed unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</HI> Either a cry of the per&s;ecuted and &s;uffering church, or a cry for vengeance. <HI>And when he had opened the fifth &s;eal, I &s;aw under the altar the &s;ouls of them that were &s;lain for the word of God, and for the te&s;timo|ny which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, &s;aying, How long, holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was &s;aid unto them, that they &s;hould re&s;t yet for a little
<PB N="374" REF="026594_0372_0FD0B46CA8020CD8">&s;ea&s;on, until their fellow-&s;ervants al&s;o, and their brethren, that &s;hould be killed as they were, &s;hould be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. A <HI>remembrance</HI> of the per&s;ecuting &s;pi|rit of this anti-chri&s;tian power is &s;poken of as warranting a decree for vengeance from the Court of Heaven. <HI>Reward her even as &s;he rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her work; in the cup which &s;he hath filled, fill to her double.</HI></P>
<P>It is probable this injunction or command is given to the mini&s;ters&mdash;to the mini&s;tering angels of God's judgments, in behalf of his church, and though it doth not call for the peaceful followers of the Lamb to wage a carnal warfare with this intolerant power, yet it doubtle&s;s authori&s;es our prayers that her de&s;truction may be &s;peedy and inevit|able.</P>
<P N="6">6. The la&s;t <HI>inherent</HI> cau&s;e of this awful calamity I &s;hall mention, is found in the pride and haughtine&s;s, luxury and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of this &s;elf exalted anti-chri&s;tian power.&mdash; <HI>How much &s;he hath glorified her&s;elf and liv|ed deliciou&s;ly, &s;o much torment and &s;orrow give her. For &s;he &s;aith in her heart&mdash;I &s;it a queen, and am no widow, and &s;hall &s;ee no &s;or|row. Therefore &s;hall her plagues come in one
<PB N="375" REF="026594_0373_0FD0B3FDEC86A2C8">day, death, and mourning, and famine; and &s;he &s;hall be utterly burned with fire: for &s;trong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</HI></P>
<P>I am led to conclude this branch of my di&s;cour&s;e, by adding, that the <HI>final</HI> cau&s;e of the de&s;truction of Babylon is the <HI>&s;entence</HI> of God again&s;t her. This &s;entence is pronoun|ced by an angel from the court, from the <HI>tri|bunal</HI> of heaven. <HI>And he cried mightily with a &s;trong voice, &s;aying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. And a mighty angel took up a &s;tone like a great mil&s;tone, and ca&s;t it into the &s;ea, &s;aying. Thus with violence &s;hall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and &s;hall be found no more at all.</HI> If you a&s;k the rea|&s;on of this judicial &s;entence from the tribu|nal of heaven, it is &s;aid&mdash;<HI>For by thy &s;orceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Having pointed out who it is over who&s;e de&s;truction holy angels and men are called upon to rejoice, and con&s;idered the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of this awful cata&s;trophe, my &s;ubject leads,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider the <HI>means</HI> by which this event &s;hall be brought about.</P>
<P>And what <HI>means,</HI> my audience, &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e might be adequate to &s;uch a ta&s;k?
<PB N="376" REF="026594_0374_0FD0B46E279865F8">to the ta&s;k of overturning a power which hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted more than twelve hundred years, &s;upported by the kings of the earth, who drink of her cup, and delight in her &s;orce|ries &mdash;who have long &s;ince lent their aid for her &s;upport again&s;t the voice of rea&s;on&mdash;the demands of Heaven, and the cries of per|i&s;hing thou&s;ands?&mdash;What power is equal to the ta&s;k of accompli&s;hing even the <HI>decree of Heaven</HI> again&s;t &s;uch might, &s;uch united force as Babylon is able to bring into the field? more e&s;pecially, when you con&s;ider that for the terror of her enemies, and for the com|fort of her friends, this intolerant power pro|fe&s;&s;es to have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the keys of hea|ven and of hell?</P>
<P>Retreat you will be ready to &s;ay from &s;uch a ta&s;k! Let no one be &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to provoke her to anger, as to &s;tir up her fury! &mdash;Many have been devoured by this levia|than, by this multi-formed, in&s;atiable mon|&s;ter; and God forbid that any more &s;hould be &s;wallowed up, whil&s;t they are able to make but a feeble, though hone&s;t attempt!</P>
<P>Our fears, my friends, are relieved whil&s;t I read to you, from the in&s;piration of God, that the angel that pronounces the decree of de&s;truction is commi&s;&s;ioned from the Court
<PB N="377" REF="026594_0375_0FD0B3FF25C5E430">of Heaven; has <HI>great power, and that the earth is lightened with his glory.</HI> And to &s;upport the executioner of the &s;entence it is added, <HI>for &s;trong is the Lord God who judg|eth her.</HI></P>
<P>As then the decree hath its origin in hea|ven, and the promulgation of it is by a me&s;|&s;enger from Heaven, we are authori&s;ed to look to Heaven for MEANS to accompli&s;h what its decree hath ordained.</P>
<P>Did it plea&s;e the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in an|cient time, to promi&s;e deliverance to the He|brews in Egyptian bondage; and did he not graciou&s;ly provide the means of deliverance? &mdash;Was it in after times threatened again&s;t this rebellious people that, for their hypo|cri&s;y and &s;ins, they &s;hould go into captivi|ty; and did not a righteous God provide the means to execute the &s;entence?&mdash;Hear the appointment of heaven to this ta&s;k. <HI>O A&s;&s;y|rian! the rod of mine anger, and the &s;taff in their hand is mine indignation! I will &s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical nation, and again&s;t the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the &s;poil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire in the &s;treets. Howbeit he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his
<PB N="378" REF="026594_0376_0FD0B46FA6A53428">heart think &s;o; but it is in his heart to de&s;troy, and out off nations not a few.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion, and on Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;y|ria, and the glory of his high looks; for he &s;aith, by the &s;trength of my hand I have done it, and by my wi&s;dom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their trea&s;ures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</HI></P>
<P>I cite this pa&s;&s;age at length, not only that the &s;entiments under con&s;ideration may be &s;upported, as to <HI>means</HI> of execution, appoint|ed by the decree of Heaven; but to teach that means may be appointed, and may e|ven execute the will of Heaven, and yet be them&s;elves wholly ignorant of the God they are &s;erving&mdash;be va&s;tly &s;inful in what they do, and be, finally, &s;orely puni&s;hed for the ungodly deed.</P>
<P>Again, did it plea&s;e God to promi&s;e de|liverance to the captive Jews from Babylon; and did he not gird his man for the purpo&s;e? <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right hand I have holden, to &s;ubdue na|tions before him; and I will loo&s;e the loins of
<PB N="379" REF="026594_0377_0FD0B400D65AF238">kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates &s;hall not be &s;hut: I will go be|fore thee, and make the crooked places &s;traight: I will break in pieces the gates of bra&s;s, and out in &s;under the bars of iron. For Jacob my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and I&s;rael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have &s;urnam|ed thee though thou ha&s;t not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e, there is no God be&s;ides me: I girded thee, though thou ha&s;t not known me.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e examples of means provided for the accompli&s;hment of mercies promi&s;ed or for the execution of judgments denounced, in the wi&s;dom of God, lay good foundation for as to proceed, and afford unerring di|rection to us in our enquries after the means or methods which God will provide and u&s;e, for the execution of the awful &s;entence of which our &s;ubject treats.</P>
<P><HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen!</HI> But by what means is &s;he to be brought down?</P>
<P>The &s;tate of this anti-chri&s;tian church is &s;poken of under &s;everal figures or emblems, all of which are to have their end in &s;ome method &s;uited to the de&s;truction of the ori|ginal figure.</P>
<P>If we a&s;k after the de&s;truction of this
<PB N="380" REF="026594_0378_0FD0B406A5426808">church under the figure of Babylon, we &s;hall find the means pre-figured under the pour|ing out of the &s;ixth vial&mdash;the vial which all pre&s;ent expo&s;itors allow to be now running.</P>
<P><HI>And the &s;ixth angel poured out his vial up|on the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the ea&s;t might be prepared.</HI></P>
<P>I need not detain you here to &s;ay that the river Euphrates &s;ignifies the wealth, the re|venues, the &s;trength and &s;upport of what|ever kind, by which Papal Babylon hath, in time pa&s;t, been upheld:&mdash;And if you wi&s;h to know whether this river hath been, or is now drying up, you may be informed by a&s;king tho&s;e who can tell to what end the revenues of the church of Rome have late|ly come. You may a&s;k where are her pri|vileges and prerogatives, her churches, her church-lands, her wonted revenues from princes and from &s;ubjects, e&s;pecially, in re|&s;pect to tho&s;e parts of the empire on which the contents of this vial have already been poured?&mdash;You may a&s;k, where is that faith, that <HI>implicit</HI> faith which was once put in her?&mdash;that domination which &s;he maintain|ed over the con&s;ciences of men?&mdash;Where are her idols&mdash;her ma&s;&s;es&mdash;her &s;uper&s;titions

As to her idols, &s;o far as there was any value in them, they are now pa&s;&s;ing in coin; and as to her mini&s;ters, they are executed and di&s;per&s;ed. Even the col|lege of Sorbonne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A celebrated in&s;titution, or college, for the re&s;idence of doc|tors, profe&s;&s;ors, and &s;tudents in divinity, at Paris, who &s;uffered in the general calamity.</NOTE> is obliged to yield up her magi, and give them, to her foes, a prey.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k why the drying up of the river Euphrates is &s;poken of, <HI>that the way of the kings of the ea&s;t may be prepared?</HI> I an&s;wer, in a word, that as ancient Euphrates was dried up, that the way of her enemies, who came from the ea&s;t, might be prepared, in their approach to her de&s;truction; &s;o this my&s;tical river is dried up, that the city it&s;elf may become an ea&s;y prey.</P>

<P>"In the drying up of the river Euphrates,
<PB N="382" REF="026594_0380_0FD0B47145981160">manife&s;t allu&s;ion is had to the manner of old Babylon's de&s;truction. The river Euphrates <HI>ran through old Babylon,</HI> and was a greater defence to it than its celebrated walls, which, for thickne&s;s and height, were the wonder of the world. Cyrus, "the leader of the Kings of the Ea&s;t," when he took Babylon, cut many ditches, and let the river Euphra|tes run out, and &s;o he and his &s;oldiers enter|ed the city, and took it. As the drying up of Euphrates, <HI>then,</HI> was an immediate fore|runner of the de&s;truction of Babylon; in like manner, the drying up of Euphrates, &s;ignify it what it will, &s;hall be the immediate fore|runner of the de&s;truction of anti-chri&s;tian Babylon, whenever it &s;hall be. The Romi&s;h Euphrates being dried up, the Romi&s;h Ba|bylon will ha&s;ten, amain, towards its final ruin."</P>
<P>Whether the Euphrates of the Romi&s;h Babylon is not already &s;o far dried up, as that the Kings of the Ea&s;t have made a breach upon her, let facts and daily intelligence de|termine.</P>
<P>What though you call the in&s;truments of this &s;ucce&s;sful attack upon Rome a lawle&s;s banditti&mdash;a race of infidels&mdash;men, who pro|fe&s;s to "know no God but Liberty, and no

<P>Tho&s;e who look through the great plan, viewing the purpo&s;es of Heaven upon a broad &s;cale, believe and know that Kings and Cap|tains, in all ages; nay, that even wicked men and devils, in the fullne&s;s of their rage, are yet under the divine controul; that the wrath of the whole, in the end, &s;hall <HI>prai&s;e him,</HI> and the <HI>remainder he is able to re&s;train.</HI></P>
<P>In running through with the de&s;truction of Babylon, the prophet notices a movement of a very extraordinary nature; an exertion made to oppo&s;e the deluge which Almighty God is cau&s;ing to over&s;pread the anti-chri&s;|tian world. But, alas! a feeble exertion, and, in the end, does but expedite the overthrow denounced.</P>
