<HEAD>A LETTER Relating to a MEDIUM of TRADE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT has been the common Complaint, ever &s;ince I have been upon the Stage, That the Times are hard and Money &s;carce. But at this Juncture, there is undoubtedly far more Rea&s;on and Truth than ordinarily has been, in the Complaints made upon the&s;e Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;pecially the latter of them.</P>
<P>But how &s;carce &s;oever Money (i. e. Bill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Credit, the only Money pa&s;&s;ing among us) be, yet 'tis obvio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that its Scarcity doth not enhance its Value: For in the Year pa&s;t, tho&s;e Gentlemen who from Time to Time have depr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ated our Bills, have given higher for Silver in &s;aid Bills, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any former Years.</P>
<P>As the &s;inking the Credit of our Province Bills, has in a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> Mea&s;ure &s;ubverted commutative Ju&s;tice thro' the Land; &s;o tho&s;e who have been the Sufferers by it, have been ready to compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of the Legi&s;lature, and too ra&s;hly to lay the Blame at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I &s;ay too ra&s;hly, for the State of our Trade and Mercha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> abroad has been &s;uch, that unle&s;s we could &s;uppo&s;e our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> chants to act with a due Regard to the publick Weal, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cau&s;e of common Ju&s;tice and Equity, as well as their priv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> per&s;onal Gain, 'tis hard to conceive how it could have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Power of any Laws what&s;oever to have kept up the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of our Bills.</P>
<P>It is certain, the Funds upon which they have been emitted, have been &s;ufficient to give them a ready Currency among&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and Per&s;ons for &s;ome Years at fir&s;t were &s;o well &s;atisfied on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Account, that our Bills really were, agreable to the De&s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">
<PB N="4" REF="004585_0003_100D6A9063E7B238">their Emi&s;&s;ion, equal in Value to lawful Silver Money: And they would undoubtedly have continued of the &s;ame Value to this Day, had they not been depreciated by tho&s;e who have been the Sellers and Buyers of Silver and Gold among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Seller of the&s;e has not been content to part with them for Bills of Credit without &s;ome Advance, and whil&s;t the Buyer, to &s;erve his pre&s;ent Turn, has yielded to give that Ad|vance, they have by that Means, in too &s;ound a Sen&s;e, been the Clippers of our Coin (i. e. our Bills of Credit) and had the fir&s;t Hand in all that Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which has been the unavoidable Con&s;equence of their Practice herein.</P>
<P>And now what is the great Temptation that has led them into this Practice? 'Tis undoubtedly &s;ome Gain to them&s;elves, either real or imaginary. But what real Gain have they ac|quir'd or could they have in View, which can be thought &s;o tempting, as to lead them into a Practice &s;o pernicious to the Publick, and of &s;o pernicious Con&s;equence in regard of Multi|tudes, who are in no Capacity to ward off the Wrong they &s;u&s;tain hereby?</P>
<P>As to the Vender of the&s;e Commodities, the very Day he got up his Silver (for In&s;tance) from 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> to 22 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, he &s;unk the Bills he receiv'd 2 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in the Pound. And now, &s;uppo&s;e he was One who&s;e Debt did exceed his Credit, though in this Ca&s;e he might di&s;charge a 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> Debt and have 2 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> left to him&s;elf; yet &s;ince his Gain was his Creditors Lo&s;s, if he be a Man of Ju&s;tice and Hone&s;ty, I &s;hould think he can take but little Satisfaction in it.</P>
<P>But this, as I apprehend, has not often been the Ca&s;e, but the Generality of tho&s;e who have had Silver to &s;ell, have been &s;uch, the Ballance of who&s;e Accompts have been in their own Favour.</P>
<P>Some Years &s;ince, a Gentleman who had Silver by him, told me, &s;uch a Merchant had been with him to buy, but that upon his holding his Silver at a higher Rate (as I remember 18 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> or 2 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Oz.) than it had u&s;ually pa&s;s'd at, they parted, yet neverthele&s;s within a few Days after, the &s;ame Merchant &s;ent him Province Bills to exchange with him at his own Price; which hereupon &s;oon became the common Rate at which Silver was &s;old.</P>
<P>This was a Gentleman free of Debt perhaps as any in the Province, and had not only a large Sum due to him upon Book, but many <HI>Hundreds of Pounds</HI> due upon Bond, payable in Province Bills. And now &s;uppo&s;e he gain'd 2 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. upon his Silver for two or three hundred Ounces, he for that Gain (&s;uppo&s;ing he rais'd it from 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> to 22 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Oz.) lo&s;t 2 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Pound upon a Sum perhaps more than <HI>two or three thou&s;and
<PB N="5" REF="004585_0004_100D6A93096B6080">Pounds.</HI> And I doubt not but this has been the Ca&s;e with many others; which when they experience the Truth of, however in&s;trumental they them&s;elves have been in bringing it to pa&s;s, they &s;eem to di&s;regard that, and fill their Mouths with Exclamations again&s;t the Government, for not keeping up the Credit of their Bills!</P>
<P>And now let us con&s;ider the Ca&s;e of the Buyer. And here, I &s;ee not but the Advance he makes, is at pre&s;ent to his own Lo&s;s. And the great Rea&s;on why he is willing to &s;u&s;tain this Lo&s;s, is the Pro&s;pect he has of making it up, by &s;etting a pro|portionable Advance upon either the Goods he has already in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or tho&s;e that next come to Hand, or both: And if he make no greater Advance upon the&s;e, than barely to make up his Lo&s;s, where is his Gain? And if he make a greater, under this Pretence, where is his Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>And now agreable to this Repre&s;entation, where is the great Gain to either the Seller or Buyer of Silver and Gold, for the Sake of which they &s;hould be led (as I &s;aid) into this Practice, &s;o pernicious to the Publick, <HI>&amp;c?</HI></P>
<P>And if there be a greater Gain to either, than this Repre&s;en|tation &s;ets in our View, I am per&s;waded, that if it were care|fully examined into, it would be found &s;uch as will not bear the Light: Nor can I think that tho&s;e who have acquired it, will be able to take much Satisfaction in it, if they con&s;ider, as I think there is Rea&s;on they &s;hould, That together with their re&s;pective Shares thereof, they mu&s;t &s;hare between them, if not the whole, yet a principal Part of the Guilt ari&s;ing from that Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which their Practice hath bro't upon the Widow and the Orphan, and all &s;uch who depend on certain Sums in Province Bills annually to be paid for their Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In brief, as the Emi&s;&s;ion of Bills of Credit, which &s;o well &s;erv'd all the Ends of Trade and Commerce among&s;t our&s;elves, put it into the Power of the Merchant &s;oon to &s;end off our Silver and Gold, as he did, &s;o his bidding upon the Silver &s;ince imported, has I think been the &s;ole Cau&s;e of the &s;inking of the Credit of our Province Bills. And it &s;eems needle&s;s and in vain to enquire after any other Cau&s;e thereof
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I am aware of it, that many have freely charg'd the Government with Breach of Faith, in po&s;tponing Payments e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, and a&s;&s;ign'd this as the Rea&s;on of the fall of the Credit of our Bills. But if I am not mi&s;inform'd, this has Reference only to the Payments of the &s;everal Loans that have been granted. With re&s;pect to which (as I humbly conceive) it will be difficult to demon&s;trate any Inju&s;tice in the Delays of tho&s;e Payments, more than there is when a private Per&s;on that lets his Money upon Intere&s;t, taking Bond for the Payment thereof in one Year, delays putting his Bond in Sute again&s;t the Debter imme|diately, if at that Period he doth not make Payment. But to a&s;&s;ign this Indulgence to the Debter whil&s;t he has given good Security, and which remains good and &s;ufficient for the Reco|very of the Bills and Intere&s;t, as any Cau&s;e of the &s;inking the Credit of the Bills &s;o lett, &s;eems not to have &s;o much as the Shadow of a Rea&s;on to &s;upport it.</HI></NOTE>. And unle&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="004585_0005_100D6A96EFA2FA10">agreable to what I before obferv'd, we might &s;uppo&s;e that the Sellers and Buyers of Silver and Gold will alter their Practice, and act more upon Principles of Wi&s;dom, Honour and Ju&s;tice, than they have done, 'twill be but a vain Thing to hope for the Continuance of that Credit our publick Bills at pre&s;ent ob|tain, nor will it be in the Power of any Laws to &s;upport their &s;inking Credit.</P>
<P>But if once our Merchants, who have the Value of our Bills &s;et by the Legi&s;lature, at their Emi&s;&s;ion, and who have the Ballances in their Hands, and ought to e&s;teem the keeping in|variable the Medium with which they carry on their Trade, as an e&s;&s;ential Ba&s;is of their ju&s;t Commerce, will be prevail'd with to take up and keep inviolate a ju&s;t Re&s;olution, not to undervalue our Bills by over-rating Silver and Gold, there will be nothing wanting, either in the Funds upon which they have been emitted, or in the Ends and U&s;es to which they may &s;erve, in order to their being pre&s;erved in their full Credit and Value.</P>
<P>And I &s;hould think what I have &s;aid, together with tho&s;e further Thoughts, which tho&s;e who clo&s;ely attend to Rea&s;on, will by the&s;e brief Hints, be naturally led into, would be &s;uffi|cient to induce every Man of Penetration and Virtue to take up and keep this Re&s;olution. And &s;hould there be found any, who&s;e earthly Souls can't be made to &s;ee an Hair's Breadth be|yond the Circle of &s;elf, and who care nothing for the Good of their Country, nor regard the Injuries and Oppre&s;&s;ions their Neighbours &s;u&s;tain, &s;o that their private per&s;onal Gain be but &s;ecured and advanced; the&s;e ought to be di&s;couraged by penal Laws, in their unrighteous Practices.</P>
<P>And as to this Practice of giving or receiving any Advance in Bills of Credit for Silver or Gold more than 5 per Cent. above the Value &s;et upon tho&s;e Bills by the Legi&s;lature at their Emi&s;&s;ion, I think, Ju&s;tice requires that they &s;hould, upon their
<PB N="7" REF="004585_0006_100D6A9A2D36D440">being detected herein, &s;uffer the &s;ame Shame and Puni&s;hment which they incur, who are convicted of clipping the KING's Coin.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e general Thoughts, I &s;hall adventure to offer a Scheme for &s;upplying the Province with a Medium of Trade, which may at pre&s;ent relieve the pre&s;&s;ing Difficulties under which it labours, prevent tho&s;e further Oppre&s;&s;ions the Inhabitants lie expo&s;ed to, and in the I&s;&s;ue introduce a better Medium.</P>
<P>And to the&s;e de&s;ired Ends, 'tis propo&s;ed;</P>
<P N="1">I. That upon the Motion of a &s;ufficient Number of Sub|&s;cribers, the Great and General Court enact a Law for the Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Bills of Credit of the following Tenor, viz.</P>

<P N="2">II. That the &s;aid Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> thus emitted, be taken out of the Trea&s;ury by &s;aid Company, each Per&s;on receiving the Sum he &s;ub&s;crib'd for, he giving good Security to the Province Trea&s;urer, either Real or Per&s;onal, for the Payment of the &s;ame at ten equal Payments, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten per Cent. per Annum, in Silver at 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, or Gold <HI>pro rato.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 'Tis propo&s;ed, That the &s;aid Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> be drawn into the Trea&s;ury by Tax upon the Inhabitants of the Province, in ten equal annual Payments, viz. <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> each Year: The fir&s;t Payment to be in 1743.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That for the Supply of the Medium, and that the Inha|bitants may be the better enabled to pay their Tax, 'tis pro|po&s;ed, that at the beginning of each Year, wherein <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> is drawn into the Trea&s;ury by Tax, there be the &s;ame Sum emitted upon the Motion of Per&s;ons belonging to the Company or others that may be di&s;pos'd to joyn them, to be taken out and paid in by the Company in the &s;ame

And let 20,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be thus call'd in by Tax, and the &s;ame Sum emitted <HI>ab Anno ad Annum,</HI> &s;o long as the Ge|neral Court &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P N="5">V. Now upon Suppo&s;ition the&s;e Emi&s;&s;ions of 20,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> are continued from 1743 to 1759, inclu&s;ive, the State of the Trea|&s;ury will be this 1760, <HI>viz.</HI> In Silver and Gold receiv'd of the Company to the amount of 450000 Ounces of Silver. In Silver and Gold due from the Company, to the Amount of 90000 Oz. and the Bills out&s;tanding will be 200000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="6">VI. 'Tis propos'd, That the above&s;aid Silver and Gold, as it comes in, be let out upon good Security at Six per Cent. per Annum, &s;pecial Regard to be had in letting the &s;ame to &s;uch Per&s;ons thro' the Province, as may be in Danger of Oppre&s;&s;ion by the Extortion of exce&s;&s;ive U&s;ury or otherwi&s;e; from &s;uch, who may delight in the Plea&s;ure which their Brethren the great Fi&s;h of the Sea, take in devouring the le&s;s. And due Care being al&s;o taken to call in the Silver &s;o let, before the Year 1760, by which Means the Sum in the Trea&s;ury may be very con&s;iderably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. 'Tis propos'd, That in the Year 1760, the &s;aid Sum of 450000 Ounces of Silver, and what may be added thereto by letting any Part thereof upon Intere&s;t, be divided to and among&s;t the &s;everal Towns in the Province, each Town to re|ceive thereof in Proportion to the Tax laid upon it. And whereas 'tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that after all the Trea&s;urer's Care, there will be &s;ome Bonds not di&s;charg'd by Per&s;ons who may have taken &s;ome Part of the Sum upon Intere&s;t, 'tis propos'd That &s;aid Bonds (if any there be) come into the Divi&s;ion, each Town taking the Bonds of their own Inhabitants as a Part of their Proportion of the Dividend.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. 'Tis propos'd, That each Town di&s;tribute the Silver and Gold by them receiv'd, to and among their Inhabitants, each one to receive thereof in Proportion to his Rate in the Province Tax. And as to their Bonds (if any there be) call them in at Di&s;cretion, in the mean Time appropriating the Intere&s;t to &s;uch Purpo&s;es as may lighten the Town Charges.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That from and after the Year 1760, the publick Taxes be laid for Silver at 6 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. or Gold <HI>pro rato,</HI> pro|viding neverthele&s;s that Bills of Credit be accepted in&s;tead there|of: And as a Reward for their good Service, and to ha&s;ten their coming in, let <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in &s;aid Bills be receiv'd as equal in Value to twenty one Penny Weight, or <HI>Seven Shil|lings</HI> in Silver. And that all private Debts after &s;aid Year
<PB N="9" REF="004585_0008_100D6A9D6CBB0108">contracted, be payable in Silver at 6 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Ounce, or in Province Bills three for one. And that one Ounce of Silver or 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in Bills, di&s;charge 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> of all Debts contracted before or in that Year.</P>
<P N="10">X. 'Tis propos'd, That 3000 Ounces, Part of the 90000 due from the Company, as it comes in, be given to <HI>Harvard College</HI> &s;o far to make good the Lo&s;s their Stock has &s;u&s;tain'd by the Fall of the Credit of our Province Bills, whereby the De&s;ign of their generous and pious Benefactors has in con&s;i|derable Mea&s;ure been fru&s;trated. And, that all other Stocks of Money, founded for the Encouragement of inferiour Schools of Learning, or any pious or charitable U&s;es, and that have &s;u&s;tained the like Lo&s;s, do receive of &s;aid Silver, a Sum that bears the &s;ame Proportion to the re&s;pective Stocks as 3000 Oz. doth to the Stock of <HI>Harvard College.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Remainder of the &s;aid Sum of 90000 Oz. be left as an additional Fund for the more &s;peedy and effectual drawing in and &s;inking the Bills out&s;tanding. 'Tis &s;uppo&s;ed that the Province Charge will be included, with the 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly to be drawn in and &s;unk in the &s;ame Tax Bill. And as Bills will pay &s;aid Tax with 1 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Pound Advance above Sil|ver, 'tis &s;uppos'd the Inhabitants will of Choice pay their Rates in Bills. And 'tis propos'd that all the Bills &s;o paid in, be &s;unk, and that in Ca&s;e the Sum paid in Bills, exceed 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> the Exce&s;s of that Sum, be paid out in Silver from &s;aid additional Fund: By which Means perhaps the Bills may all be gathered in and &s;unk, in &s;ix or &s;even, in&s;tead of ten Years.</P>
<P>If the above&s;aid Scheme be proceeded to, and bro't to Effect, 'tis obvious to the di&s;cerning Reader,</P>
<P N="1">1. That all Temptation to hoarding up the Bills, and &s;o de|feating the De&s;ign of their Emi&s;&s;ion, which is, to &s;erve as a Medium of Trade, is obviated: The Importance of which may be &s;een, in which Experience teaches, with Re&s;pect to the en&s;naring Scheme upon which the Merchants Notes were emitted.</P>
<P N="2">2. That which is here propos'd, &s;trongly tends to defeat the unrighteous Hopes, and di&s;courage the oppre&s;&s;ive Practices of avaritious Men: For as there will be a Medium of Trade provided, &s;o there will be a growing Sum in the Trea&s;ury to be let upon good Security at lawful Intere&s;t, by which Means Per&s;ons will not lie at the Mercy of their Oppre&s;&s;ors, but may be &s;upply'd where they will be treated with Ju&s;tice. And if finally they become Debtors to their own Towns, 'tis to be expected they will be treated by their Neighbours agreable to the Laws of Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="004585_0009_100D6A9F429BD4D8">
3. That we &s;hall be furni&s;hed with a Medium of Trade, which for the pre&s;ent Time, will be as good to all Intents and Purpo&s;es within our&s;elves, as Silver and Gold; and &s;uch a one as will hold its Value: For the&s;e Bills being receiv'd by the Province Trea&s;urer, and by the Company, according to the Tenor thereof, it will not be in the Power of others to depre|ciate them. If others &s;hould advance upon their Commodities, the Effect would be, that the Company (acting with Ju&s;tice and Honour) would draw all the Trade of the Province. And unle&s;s others can make &s;uch Advance, there is no Danger of their bidding upon Silver and Gold, and con&s;equently no Dan|ger of the Bills being depreciated, e&s;pecially when 'tis further con&s;ider'd, that in a few Years they will convert into Silver and Gold.</P>
<P N="4">4. That at the Period propos'd, the Province will be fur|ni&s;h'd with a Medium for Trade in Silver and Gold, of more Value than 600000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of the pre&s;ent Currency; and every in|dividual Per&s;on have his Proportion of it in his Pocket or at Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The great Enquiry is, <HI>Whether what has been propos'd is prac|ticable?</HI> And in order to the forming a proper Judgment upon this Head, the&s;e three Things are carefully to be con&s;i|der'd, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the</HI> SUBSCRIBERS.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Part a&s;&s;ign'd to the</HI> PROVINCE.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What Influence this</HI> SCHEME, <HI>&s;hould it take Effect, would have upon our</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Plantations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the Sub&s;cribers. And this, be&s;ides the Obligation they lay them&s;elves under, ex|pre&s;s'd in the Face of the Bills, is only to pay in 10 per Cent. annually, of the re&s;pective Sums they receive, 'till the whole be paid. And &s;urely, with but ordinary Succe&s;s in their Trade, they will be able to do this, and find their Account in undertaking it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay 'tis only this, be&s;ides the Obligation he brings him&s;elf under to receive 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in the&s;e Bills, as equal in Value to one Ounce of Silver in all Payments; which Obligation why &s;hould any Merchant decline bringing him&s;elf under? Were the Me|dium with which they carry on their Trade, wholly Silver and Gold, and &s;o &s;uch as with little or no Variation would hold its Value, would he not then, generally &s;peaking, &s;et the &s;ame Advance upon his Goods from Year to Year, and yet have &s;ufficient Encouragement to proceed in his Bu&s;ine&s;s? And why is there not then as great Encouragement to proceed in
<PB N="11" REF="004585_0010_100D6AA19692ABD8">it, upon Suppo&s;ition, the proper Medium is pre&s;erv'd in its full Value, and he goes on to &s;et his Advance accordingly? But here 'twill be &s;aid, That though in the &s;uppos'd Ca&s;e he might have the &s;ame Encouragement, yet that in our pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances, he is &s;o &s;traitned and pre&s;s'd for Returns, and Sil|ver being &s;o &s;carce, which is the be&s;t Commodity to make Returns in, tho&s;e that have it being fully knowing to all this, will not part with their Silver for the&s;e Bills, without Advance; and therefore if he obtain them, he mu&s;t comply to give it.</P>
<P>To this I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. That allowing the Truth of what is here &s;ugge&s;ted, and that the Merchant for the&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;hould give &s;ome Advance in Bills for Silver to make Returns, doth it thence follow that he mu&s;t needs rai&s;e in Proportion upon all his Commodities? Is there any Rea&s;on in it, that becau&s;e Silver is &s;carce and in Demand, he gives &s;ome Advance in Bills for it, that therefore he mu&s;t make the &s;ame Advance upon all other Commodities, tho' they be not &s;carce nor in &s;o great Demand? It would be no Detriment to the Credit of the Bills, if &s;uch an Advance was given in Exchange for Silver, as might be &s;ufficient to in|duce Per&s;ons to make the Exchange, if at the &s;ame Time the Bills were allowed to have their ju&s;t Value (i. e. the Value &s;et on them by the Legi&s;lature) in the purcha&s;ing all other Com|modities. Nor in this Ca&s;e would there be any Danger of their fluctuating, but their Value would be neverthele&s;s invariable.</P>
<P>But</P>
<P N="2">2. What imaginable Rea&s;on is there, or what Advantage can it be under the Circum&s;tances pleaded, for the Merchant to go on from Year to Year to bid higher and higher for Silver? An Ounce of Silver now it co&s;ts 29 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in Province Bills, is no better at <HI>London</HI> than it was when it co&s;t but <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in the &s;ame Bills: And 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> then as effectually and readily pre|cured it, as 29 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> doth now. In brief, as Silver, let the Price of it here be what it will, is not thereby alter'd in its Value at Home; &s;o it was as readily &s;old, by tho&s;e that had it, when it was but 9 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per Oz. as it is now 'tis 29 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> And however the Merchant is pre&s;s'd for Returns, and Silver be the be&s;t Commo|dity to an&s;wer that End, yet he can have no more Silver than there is; and a &s;maller Advance, as Experience has &s;hown, has been as effectual to draw into his Hands the whole of that, as a greater. And were this Practice of giving higher and higher for Silver, laid a&s;ide, every Per&s;on that wants would have as good a Pro&s;pect of being &s;upply'd, as in this Way. For if none gave &s;uch Advance, the Seller would not expect it, but he that fir&s;t &s;pake, would have the Refu&s;al; and when tho&s;e that want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, look out with greater Care and Diligence, they may ex|pect
<PB N="12" REF="004585_0011_100D6AA4CD8B5C88">Succe&s;s, and their Practice is more rational and far le&s;s exceptional, than in &s;triving to an&s;wer their End by bidding a greater Advance than others are willing to give.</P>
<P N="3">3. I reply, That whatever Straits the Merchant may be in for Returns, and however great his Temptations may be under all Circum&s;tances, to rai&s;e the Price he gives for Silver, yet the&s;e will not ju&s;tify him in the Practice, if the Practice it &s;elf be &s;uch as involves Inju&s;tice or Di&s;hone&s;ty in it. Which that it doth I think I have already &s;aid enough to evince. To which I &s;hall only de&s;ire the Reader to add, the Con&s;ideration of the Way which this Practice opens to de&s;igning Men, to deal un|ju&s;tly to the la&s;t Degree.</P>
<P>And I think he can't but di&s;cern, &s;o much of this, as to &s;hew him, upon how precarious Foundations Ju&s;tice &amp; Righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;tand, in the pre&s;ent State of our Affairs, and of how great Importance it is, that proper Care &s;hould be taken in the Mat|ter. And that therefore the Obligation propo&s;ed (and under our Con&s;ideration) is both rea&s;onable and important, and what no wi&s;e and ju&s;t Man &s;hould decline, in the mo&s;t explicit Man|ner to bring him&s;elf under.</P>
<P>But I now pa&s;s,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the Part in this Scheme a&s;&s;igned to the Pro|vince, and this is to pay in annually a Tax of <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 200000. That is &s;o much be&s;ides the current Charges of each Year, which this Scheme doth not meddle with.</P>
<P>And I &s;hould think this no in&s;upportable Burden: 'Tis true the Inhabitants of the Province complain of the Weight of the Taxes at pre&s;ent laid upon them; but 'tis to be con&s;ider'd, that the pre&s;ent Taxes are heavier, and will continue &s;o to be till 1743, than what is here propo&s;ed. And be&s;ides, the Ground of the pre&s;ent Complaint is really not &s;o much becau&s;e of the Greatne&s;s of the Tax, as the Scarcity of Money. And &s;ince in this Scheme there is Provi&s;ion made for a competent Supply, it can't be thought, but that they will bear ea&s;ily the Tax propo&s;ed, and that with the greater Chearfulne&s;s, &s;eeing they will not only be, perhaps more than rewarded by the Be|nefit they will receive from the U&s;e of &s;o good a Medium of Exchange, but after a few Years, will have their Bills return'd into their own Hands in good Silver and Gold, with Intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">III. What Influence this Scheme, &s;hould it take Effect, will have upon our Briti&s;h Trade.</P>
<P>I mention this, becau&s;e, that however we might argue, that by our Charter the General A&s;&s;embly of the Province, are ve&s;t|ed with full Power to tran&s;act &s;uch an Affair in and by them|&s;elves, yet &s;ince the principal Advantage <HI>Great Britain</HI> reaps from the Plantations, ari&s;es from the &s;upplying them with their
<PB N="13" REF="004585_0012_100D6AA6C0B86ED8">Manufacturies, and receiving in Returns &s;uch Commodities as the Plantations have or can get in their Power: If &s;uch a Scheme as this &s;hould be thought to clog that Trade, and &s;o be detrimental to his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects there, 'tis but ju&s;t to expect that Ob&s;tructions will be thrown in the Way, to prevent its taking Effect.</P>
<P>And I think, as the Matter has been managed among&s;t us, 'tis no wonder that it has reached his Maje&s;ty's Ear, and that he has &s;o far interpo&s;ed in the Affair of our emitting Bills of Credit, as to give In&s;tructions to his Governour of this Pro|vince relating thereto. For beyond doubt, the Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> who have &s;upplied us with their valuable Commodities, have not only, been &s;ometimes long kept out of their Money, but when it has come to Hand, it has fallen &s;hort of what it ought to have been, as much as our Paper-Currency has &s;unk in its Credit, which however it may not have been the Effect of De&s;ign and Pre-meditation in our Merchants, yet it has really been an Inju&s;tice, and &s;o far as this has been the Ca&s;e, his Maje&s;ty's endeavouring to redre&s;s it, by giving &s;uch In&s;truc|tions to his Governour, as he thought proper for that End, ought to be deem'd, but the Fruit of his paternal Care for the good of his Subjects.</P>
<P>But now if what is here propo&s;ed, will be found upon Ex|amination, &s;ufficient to fix the Value of our Bills, the Grie|vance will be removed, and upon a proper Repre&s;entation the In&s;tructions will undoubtedly be recall'd, e&s;pecially if it be further found that this Scheme, tends greatly to the flouri&s;h|ing of our Briti&s;h Trade, and &s;o to the mutual Advantage of his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects there and in this Province, which that it doth might ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated, but I forbear; and &s;hall now clo&s;e by ob&s;erving,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the foregoing Scheme I have the rather &s;et the Va|lue, at the Rate I have, that &s;o they might the better corre&s;pond with tho&s;e Bills of Credit of this Province, already pa&s;&s;ing a|mong&s;t us. For whil&s;t the Law &s;ets tho&s;e of the new Tenor (as we di&s;tingui&s;h them) at 6 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> the Ounce, and at the &s;ame Time requires three for one, if paid in Bills of the old Tenor, it doth in Effect &s;et the old Tenor Bills at the Rate of 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;&s;.</HI></ABBR> the Ounce. And however by an ill Management, nei|ther of tho&s;e Sorts of Bills, at pre&s;ent carry in them that Value, e&s;pecially as received by the Merchant, yet they ought to car|ry it, and I think their &s;inking Credit ought &s;o far to be reco|vered, as to bring them to that, as being (all Things con&s;i|der'd) the mo&s;t proper Standard. And as the Government are obliged to receive them at that Rate, &s;o it may be of good Ef|fect for the above&s;aid Company to take them in all Payments
<PB N="14" REF="004585_0013_100D6AA8B4DD95A8">at the &s;ame Rate too; and as it will be needful that a proper In&s;trument be drawn for them to &s;ub&s;cribe, it &s;eems very ad|vi&s;eable, there &s;hould be an Article therein obliging them &s;o to do.</P>
<P>This being undertaken and comply'd with, will certainly fix an equal Value upon the Bills projected in the foregoing Scheme, and tho&s;e already extant, nor can there I think be a|ny Danger but that both will hold their Value, for what ima|ginable Rea&s;on can there be, for any to &s;et a le&s;s Value upon <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in the&s;e Bills than upon an Ounce of Silver? if at pre&s;ent it will purcha&s;e the &s;ame Quantity of &s;uch Goods as he wants, that an Ounce of Silver would, and which had he the Silver, he would part with it for? The Truth is, what|ever I have to part with, that will as well procure what I at pre&s;ent want, as Silver and Gold would, is at pre&s;ent as good to me, as Silver and Gold them&s;elves. For which Rea&s;on, he that can think ab&s;tractly, mu&s;t, I think, be able to &s;ee, that a Medium of Trade, con&s;idered meerly as &s;uch, is no whit the better or wor&s;e, on Account of what we call intrin&s;ick Value, be the &s;ame greater or le&s;s. But its true Value as a Medium of Trade is to be e&s;timated, by the Credit it obtains, and the Demand it is in. And &s;ince Silver and Gold were never in greater Demand in any Common-Wealth, than our Paper-Medium is, and is like to continue to be in this Province, there appears nothing wanting in the Nature of Things to &s;up|port its Value, &s;o long as we have Silver and Gold, Fi&s;h, Lum|ber, and all Nece&s;&s;aries of Life to buy, &s;o long as we have Ships and Hou&s;es to build, Farms to purcha&s;e and &s;ubdue, and <HI>Debts to pay;</HI> and &s;o long as with our Paper-Medium all the&s;e Things may be accompli&s;hed, there is no Hazard of its not being in Demand.</P>
<P>The only Thing needful then to keep up its Value, is the making a proper and re&s;olute Stand again&s;t that inconfiderate Folly (to put the mo&s;t charitable Con&s;truction upon it) which it was the main De&s;ign of the Pages preceeding the foregoing Scheme to detect. Which Folly might and ought in Ju&s;tice, I think, to have been corrected long ago (and e&s;pecially by the Merchants at that Juncture when they emitted their Notes) and which it will be in the Power of the Company &s;hould this Scheme take Effect, by a wi&s;e and ju&s;t Management ea&s;ily to over-rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although I have &s;et to the foregoing Scheme (to the End it might be the more fully conceiv'd of) the Period of 1760, yet the Reader will ob&s;erve that I have left the Matter of fixing the Period to the Di&s;cretion of the General Court. And although that &s;hould be the Period fix'd by them, and
<PB N="15" REF="004585_0014_100D6AACD0699D48">agreable to what has been projected, the Province &s;hould then be furni&s;hed with &s;o large and valuable a Medium, and that &s;o effectually &s;cattered among&s;t the Inhabitants, yet it is very uncer|tain whether the State of the Trade of the Province will not then be &s;uch, as that in a few Years, it will grow too &s;cant to &s;erve the End, thro' the Demand Silver and Gold will &s;till be in for Ex|portation. And whether it will not be found that a Paper-Medium, is better adapted to promote the Trade and Pro&s;peri|ty of the Province, than one that con&s;i&s;ts of Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>It has been generally complain'd of, as a Failure in our Trade, That our Importation exceeds our Exportation, and this has been a&s;&s;ign'd by many as the Rea&s;on why Silver and Gold don't center with us. But if tho&s;e that advance this, would be under&s;tood to intend, That our Exportation falls &s;hort of being &s;ufficient to pay for what is imported to us, I think it can't in Rea&s;on be true; for were this the Ca&s;e, we &s;hould long ere now been Bankrupt. And if they intend that the Value of what we im|port as Returns, exceeds the Value of our Exportation, and this be true, 'tis by no Means to be complain'd of as a Failure in our Trade. Yet, &s;uppo&s;e the Balance of the&s;e were a <HI>Million</HI> a Year in our Favour, it would not thence <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> follow, that any of that Balance would re&s;t with us in Silver and Gold. (tis true, if our Exportation &s;hould be &s;ufficient to procure a greater Quantity of foreign Commodities, and Silver and Gold too (which 'tis to be remembred, is not our own Production) than we could our&s;elves con&s;ume or apply to the carrying on and increa&s;ing the &s;everal Branches of our Trade, the Balance in this Ca&s;e, would remain with us in Silver and Gold, as being of all our Effects the mo&s;t convenient to lay by. But when or whe|ther ever this will be the Ca&s;e is uncertain, nor need we concern our&s;elves much about it: For, 'till it is the Ca&s;e, tho' Silver and Gold will not abide with us, it will be our Advantage to &s;end it off; and the Balance of our Trade, if it be in our Fa|vour, will remain with us, and naturally center in the Cultiva|tion and beautifying this exten&s;ive Land, the Accompli&s;hment whereof will take an almo&s;t immen&s;e Sum, it being as yet (com|paratively &s;peaking) but a rough and unpoli&s;h'd Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>And 'till this be in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure accompli&s;h'd, 'tis not in Rea&s;on to be expected, that Manufacturies will be carry'd on with any great Degree of Strength and Advantage among&s;t us; And con&s;equently 'tis to be expected that foreign Manufacturies, &s;pecially tho&s;e <HI>Great Britain</HI> abounds with, will be in great De|mand with us. Nor can the Silver and Gold we may receive from <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-India I&s;lands,</HI> be better im|prov'd, than by &s;ending it to <HI>Great Britain</HI> to procure them for our U&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004585_0015_100D6AAE749136E0">
And le&s;t any &s;hould think that the SCHEME I have above pro|po&s;ed, militates with what I now advance, I would ob&s;erve, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ever by &s;aid SCHEME 'tis propos'd that 20000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of Sil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e annually &s;top'd in its Circulation, in the Way of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade for a Number of Years, yet the De&s;ign hereof is, to give Life and Value to the PAPER MEDIUM projected, by the Help of which we &s;hall undoubtedly be able to import more than double that Sum, beyond what we po&s;&s;ibly could, upon Suppo&s;ition of our being de&s;titute of &s;uch a Medium.</P>
