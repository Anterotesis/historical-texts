<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CINCINNATI, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been long ago ob&s;erved (and every day's experience evinces with how much truth and propriety) <HI>"That there is no gift of na|ture, nor effect of art, however beneficial to mankind, which is not &s;ometimes perverted to a mi&s;chievous purpo&s;e."</HI> Whatever may be the cau&s;e of happine&s;s, may al&s;o be the cau&s;e of mi&s;ery. The &s;ame medicine which &s;kilfully applied has power to cure, when ignorance or malice dictates, the pre&s;cription has an equal power to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>This preliminary ob&s;ervation holds &s;trictly true with regard to the liberty of the pre&s;s, and will not (I tru&s;t) be thought to be here im|properly applied, by the attentive readers of a late pamphlet, entitled, <HI>"Con&s;iderations on the Society or Order of the Cincinnati."</HI> The LIBER|TY OF THE PRESS however (that PALLA|DIUM of the rights of nature) is very properly protected in this country, as the PILLAR that &s;upports the whole fabric of freedom, and con|&s;idering the advantages which &s;ociety derives from it, every member of the community ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied with this conciliating
<PB N="4" REF="018073_0003_0FA4B5492673A0C0">
reflection, "That in no &s;ingle in&s;tance is per|fection the lot of humanity."</P>
<P>In this age of literary intelligence, no &s;ooner has a popular pamphlet e&s;caped from the groans of the pre&s;s, than it flies, (as it were in|&s;tantaniou&s;ly) to every point of the compa&s;s, and if impregnated with venom, every where wafts its poi&s;on from centre to circumfer|ence. The pre&s;s (in this enlightened aera of the world) finds employment for all the purpo&s;|es of civil and of &s;ocial life; the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e political rea&s;onings are no longer held impervi|ous to vulgar eyes. The tippling philo&s;opher, and the village politician, familiarly di&s;cu&s;s the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects by the means of it, and &s;agaciou&s;ly predict the fate of kingdoms by the revolutions of the tankard. It mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed, that there is no character, no &s;tati|on of life, no man &s;o ju&s;t, no &s;et of men &s;o re&s;pectable, to which it does not afford food for calumny to reproach, or envy to malign. <HI>Perhaps</HI> there is nothing more important to the welfare of a &s;tate, than that the channel of public information &s;hould &s;low pure and in|corrupt, and that citizen is at lea&s;t re&s;pectable who only <HI>endeavours</HI> to clear the &s;tream from the filth with which it is impregnated. TO DO THIS is the object of the en&s;uing &s;heets; and to di&s;&s;ipate error, as it confers no incon|&s;iderable benefit, &s;urely it merits no vulgar prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The advantages of nature or of fortune have been ob&s;erved in all ages (&s;ays John&s;on) to con|tribute little to the promotion of happine&s;s. Tho&s;e (whom the &s;plendor of their rank, or
<PB N="5" REF="018073_0004_0FA4B549F325B060">
the extent of their capacity have placed upon the &s;ummit of human life) have &s;eldom given any ju&s;t occa&s;ion to envy, in tho&s;e who look up to them from a lower &s;tation. Such is the infirmity of human nature, that every <HI>appear|ance</HI> of &s;uperiority (however nece&s;&s;ary to the policy and government of a &s;tate) naturally excites &s;ullen &s;u&s;picion in the brea&s;ts of the &s;ubordinate; and the misfortune is, that the <HI>be&s;t characters and the noble&s;t in&s;titutions</HI> are often marked out as the fir&s;t objects of popu|lar re&s;entment.</P>
<P>"The faire&s;t blo&s;&s;om is the reptile's food."</P>
<P>The very illiberal reflections and <HI>aggravated</HI> con&s;equences deduced from the in&s;titution of the order of the Cincinnati, will, I tru&s;t, be added as one more to the innumerable proofs which hi&s;tory and experience already offers of this melancholy truth.</P>
<P>It is recorded of the celebrated Engli&s;h poet Pope (who felt the full force of detraction, from the peer at St. James's down to the por|ter at St. Giles's) that when he publi&s;hed his poem of the Dunciad, he carefully collated all the pieces that envy and ignorance had generated, and gave them (HIMSELF) entire to the world.</P>
<P>Truth certainly derives double advantage from the effect of contra&s;t. Light is the more dazzling to him who emerges out of darkne&s;s, and the diamond has a lu&s;tre more brilliant by compari&s;on. Induced by the &s;ame motives, I &s;hall beg leave to introduce here THE PLAN

<P>IT having plea&s;ed the Supreme Governor of the univer&s;e, in the di&s;po&s;ition of hu|man affairs, to cau&s;e the &s;eparation of the colonies of North America from the domina|tion of Great Britain, and, after a bloody conflict of eight years, to e&s;tabli&s;h them free, &s;overeign, and independent &s;tates, connected, by alliances founded on reci|procal advantage, with &s;ome of the great princes and powers of the earth.</P>
<P>To perpetuate, therefore, as well the remembrance of this great event, as the mutual friend&s;hips which have been form|ed under the pre&s;&s;ure of common danger, and in many in&s;tances cemented by the blood of the parties, the officers of the American army do hereby in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner a&s;&s;ociate, con&s;titute, and combine them&s;elves into one SOCIETY OF FRIENDS, to endure as long as they &s;hall endure, or any of their elde&s;t male po&s;terity, and in failure thereof, the collateral branches, who may be judged
<PB N="7" REF="018073_0006_0FA4B54B5C278500">
worthy of becoming its &s;upporters and members.</P>
<P>The officers of the American army, hav|ing generally been taken from the citizens of America, po&s;&s;e&s;s high veneration for the character of that illu&s;trious Roman, LUCIUS QUINTUS CINCINNATUS, and being re|&s;olved to follow his example by returning to their citizen&s;hip, think they may with propriety denominate them&s;elves, THE SO|CIETY OF THE CINCINNATI.</P>
<P>The following principles &s;hall be immut|able, and form the ba&s;is of the <HI>Society of the Cincinnati.</HI></P>
<P>An ince&s;&s;ant attention to pre&s;erve invio|late tho&s;e exalted rights and liberties of hu|man nature, for which they have fought and bled, and without which the high rank of a <HI>rational</HI> being is a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>An unalterable determination to promote and cheri&s;h between the re&s;pective &s;tates, that union and national honour, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, and the future dignity of the American empire.</P>
<P>To render permanent the cordial affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the officers: this &s;pirit will dictate brotherly kindne&s;s in all things, and particularly extend to the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial acts of beneficence, according to the ability of the &s;ociety, towards tho&s;e officers and their families, who unfortunately may be under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving it.</P>
<P>The general &s;ociety will, for the &s;ake of frequent communications, be divided into

&s;tate &s;ocieties, and tho&s;e again into &s;uch di&s;|tricts as &s;hall be directed by the &s;tate &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>The &s;ocieties of the di&s;tricts to meet as of|ten as &s;hall be agreed upon by the &s;tate &s;ocie|ties, tho&s;e of the &s;tate on the fourth day of July annually, or oftener if they find it expe|dient; and the general &s;ociety on the fir&s;t Monday in May annually, &s;o long as they &s;hall deem it nece&s;&s;ary; and afterwards at lea&s;t once in every three years.

<P>Each &s;tate meeting &s;hall write annually, or oftener if nece&s;&s;ary, a circular letter to the other &s;tate &s;ocieties, noting whatever they may think worthy of ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting the good of the &s;ociety or the general union of the &s;tates, and giving information of the officers cho&s;en for the current year: Copies of the&s;e letters &s;hall be regularly tran&s;|mitted to the &s;ecretary general of the &s;ociety, who will record them in a book to be a&s;|&s;igned for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>In order to form funds which may be re|&s;pectable, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate, each officer &s;hall deliver to the trea&s;urer of the &s;tate &s;ociety one months pay, which &s;hall remain for ever to the u&s;e of the &s;tate &s;o|ciety, the intere&s;t only of which, if nece&s;|&s;ary, to be appropriated to the relief of the unfortunate.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e officers who are foreigners, not re|&s;ident in any of the &s;tates, will have their names enrolled by the &s;ecretary general, and are to be con&s;idered as members in the &s;ocieties of any of the &s;tates in which they may happen to be.</P>

<P>The world gives the credit of this pamphlet to the pen of a celebrated lawyer, and the many rhetorical flowers that decorate the perform|ance, manife&s;tly tends to &s;hew the hand that
<PB N="13" REF="018073_0012_0FA4B55253BAFAC8">
planted them. The report, however has gained ground from the &s;ilent acquie&s;cence of the per|&s;on to whom the production is attributed. And if the child is not of his lawful i&s;&s;ue, the &s;anction of bearing his name has given it a title by adop|tion. For my own part I con&s;ider the learned gentleman as publicly wearing his laurels, and not a little vain of his literary accompli&s;hments. Gentlemen of the long robe from their profe&s;|&s;ional practice acquire a wonderful fluency of expre&s;&s;ion and an uncommon facility of argu|ment. Engaged in the indi&s;criminate defence of right and wrong, from the force of habit only, they argue a bad cau&s;e with the &s;ame zealous ardour that they would defend a good one; and this too, I am willing to believe, without any very bad de&s;ign or malevolence of intention. With different &s;entiments I &s;hould feel an inclination (too &s;trong perhaps to re&s;i&s;t in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) to pay a com|pliment to his under&s;tanding that might ope|rate a little at the expence of his integrity.</P>
<P>Conceiving my&s;elf addre&s;&s;ing a lawyer (with|out u&s;ing legal language) I &s;hall adopt a legal idea, for where there is a latitude that affords me the choice of <HI>two</HI> con&s;tructions, that only will be taken by me which is the mo&s;t agreea|ble to candour and humanity.</P>
<P>Viewing only the <HI>back ground</HI> of the pic|ture&mdash;how gloomy would be the pro&s;pect&mdash; It might be urged, that the external appearance of patrioti&s;m was often deficient in its con&s;titu|ent qualities&mdash;That many a&s;&s;ume that highe&s;t of all human titles who have no other preten|&s;ions to &s;uch claims than di&s;&s;eminating di&s;con|tent&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="018073_0013_0FA4B552E7A5BC08">
propagating reports of dangerous coun|cils, violated rights and encroaching u&s;urpa|tions&mdash;In&s;tigating the people with outcries, uttered with malignity and echoed by folly&mdash; To which might be added, a very &s;incere la|mentation, that (as it were by &s;ome unfortu|nate fatality) loud and empty declamation is always accepted by the multitude as the trum|pet of truth and fame, while the zephyr breath of wi&s;dom and moderation is altogether ne|glected or received with the mo&s;t mortifying indifference. <HI>Certainly,</HI> however that patriot|i&s;m is que&s;tionable which profe&s;&s;es to be di&s;|turbed by <HI>incredibilities,</HI> and it is equally cer|tain that the common marks of patrioti&s;m are &s;uch as artifice may counterfeit or folly mi&s;apply.</P>
<P>I do not&mdash;cannot&mdash;will not&mdash;attribute the con&s;iderations on the Society or Order of the Cincinnati to <HI>&s;uch motives,</HI> they may be traced, I fancy, to others which have their &s;ource in the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of human nature. The man of genius and literature, who has toiled for his acqui&s;itions, who has wa&s;ted the midnight oil over his lucubrations, naturally <HI>pants</HI> after di&s;|tinction, he feels an ardent but hone&s;t ambiti|on to &s;hew tho&s;e talents to an admiring world, which have co&s;t him &s;o much care to poli&s;h and improve. The in&s;titution of the order of the Cincinnati &s;prings up&mdash;The author of the Con|&s;iderations <HI>feels</HI> his talents&mdash;the <HI>cacoethes &s;cri|bendi</HI> &s;econds&mdash;&s;timulates this de&s;ire of di&s;|tinction&mdash;the ardour of compo&s;ition heats the imagination and (what fle&s;h alive)

<P>Wanting lei&s;ure <HI>as well as books</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to give that ample refutation of the &s;heets before me which I could wi&s;h, I am principally urged to this weak endeavour with a view to rou&s;e &s;ome abler pen in defence of this honourable order and valuable in&s;titution, <HI>not wanting</HI> in the&s;e advantages. It is my intention, however, to ob&s;erve upon the author's principal argu|ments, and endeavour to &s;hew the people the &s;ubterfuges by which rea&s;on is eluded; and if in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervations I &s;hould exer|ci&s;e con&s;iderable freedom, the author of the con|&s;iderations ought not to be offended at a liberty of which he has him&s;elf given an example.</P>
<P>THAT to which all would otherwi&s;e be in|different, often attracts notice from the appen|dage of a name, and the magnitude of the performance. But I mu&s;t beg my readers to emancipate their minds from that captivating delu&s;ion, and not to &s;et off with an idea, that

<P>The learned gentleman INTRODUCES his ob&s;ervations with an account of the Order it&s;elf (the object of animadver&s;ion) and a &s;plendid di&s;play of his talents for de&s;cription in a mi|nute hi&s;tory of the medal and the ribband (in our author's eyes) <HI>things mo&s;t odious</HI> and con|&s;tituting his chief charge of criminality.

<P>THEN follows an enumeration of the many great public characters who have dignified the order by becoming honorary members of it, and who (if Ca&s;&s;ius &s;upports his charge) certainly owe him an acknowledgment for making them <HI>acce&s;&s;aries</HI> to a crime which our patriot law|yer reprobates in the bittere&s;t terms of a&s;pe|rity and reproach.</P>
<P>No ta&s;k (however ardous) will the &s;pirit of enterprize forego! Wa&s;hington him&s;elf cannot e&s;cape him&mdash;by a novel idea, and argument inverted, our great general is made to &s;hew his di&s;approbation of the Order, <HI>by conde&s;cending to become a member of it.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> is called the leading feature of our great general's character&mdash;he is made by Ca&s;&s;ius to di&s;approve this Order, and as a <HI>&s;ig|nal in&s;tance</HI> of this <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> to avow his di&s;|approbation&mdash;<HI>by becoming a member of it.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN&mdash;<HI>To become a member of a &s;ociety</HI> (and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, certainly the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important member) is, according to Ca&s;&s;ius&mdash;to act a <HI>neutral</HI> part.</P>
<P>LOGIC is &s;urely exploded the bar of South-Carolina, &s;he certainly has quitted her &s;eat upon the bench.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius is a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;that this &s;elf-created order has not excited the lea&s;t attention&mdash;is apparently di&s;appointed, that it is not even made a &s;ubject for the tattle of a tea-table, and concludes with this affecting apo&s;trophe&mdash; HOW BLIND ARE THE MULTITUDE! Yet this &s;ame people, in the very &s;ame page, are repre&s;ented as re&s;tle&s;s, vigilant, and active, <HI>feelingly alive</HI> to &s;u&s;picion, and prone to re&s;ent|ment upon &s;uch objects as are in the lea&s;t cal|culated to excite it.</P>
<P>It is a truth which can no longer be con|cealed, that in &s;ome parts of the&s;e <HI>Oracular Leaves</HI> (where Ca&s;&s;ius is &s;o piteou&s;ly doleful) that he &s;ometimes nods towards dullne&s;s, and in others (where he is argumentative) that contradictions are &s;et &s;taring one another in the face, in a &s;tate of enmity that excludes every hope of reconciliation.</P>
<P>TWO po&s;itions &s;tanding in direct oppo&s;ition of equal authority, afford me, I apprehend,
<PB N="18" REF="018073_0017_0FA4B55A0C40B418">
the liberty of <HI>chu&s;ing,</HI> and from the general ap|pearance of rea&s;oning which pervades the whole, it may, I think, be collected, as Ca&s;|&s;ius's meaning. "That dullne&s;s holds her em|pire over the people at large with whom I &s;uppo&s;e he includes their repre&s;entatives and that the di&s;covery of the dreadful political con|&s;equences with which this in&s;titution is preg|nant, was left to the Lynx's eye of the pene|trating Ca&s;&s;ius." They are indeed &s;uch <HI>in re|pre&s;entation,</HI> as made me tremble, and it is not to be denied, but that they are told in &s;uch a melancholy tale of &s;erious &s;adne&s;s, and with as much appearance of &s;incerity, as if the learn|ed gentleman <HI>him&s;elf</HI> really believed them.</P>
<P>Let us examine the grounds upon which this immen&s;e political &s;uper&s;tructure has been rai&s;|ed, and we &s;hall find it built upon a &s;andy foundation.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s (it &s;eems) are dull as the people, or, what is wor&s;e, that which they do &s;ee is <HI>winked at</HI>&mdash;Yes! and winked at, Ca&s;|&s;ius (I dare apprehend) for &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons &mdash;becau&s;e they fore&s;ee <HI>no</HI> con&s;equences re&s;ult|ing from this &s;ociety, likely to be injurious to the community. The <HI>&s;ilence</HI> of that re&s;pect|able body (the watchful guardians of the com|monwealth is the &s;tronge&s;t argument of the <HI>innocence</HI> of the in&s;titution; but it is, at all events, as fair for me to infer <HI>approbation</HI> from the <HI>&s;ilence</HI> of the Congre&s;s, as for Ca&s;&s;ius to urge the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">approbation</HI> of General Wa&s;h|ington, <HI>from his being a member of it.</HI></P>
<P>If the Congre&s;s do not &s;ee the con&s;equences &s;tated by Ca&s;&s;ius, they are as dull as the peo|ple,
<PB N="19" REF="018073_0018_0FA4B55B82507FB0">
and this is in that ca&s;e, a very <HI>unlucky</HI> country; if they do &s;ee them in the light &s;ug|ge&s;ted by Ca&s;&s;ius, and di&s;regard them, this is a&s;&s;uredly a very <HI>unhappy</HI> country. But having an eye upon the in&s;titution from its birth, and taking no mea&s;ures to de&s;troy it in the em|brio, it is mo&s;t likely the danger exi&s;ts no where but in the imagination of the vi&s;ionary Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>What <HI>inducements</HI> would Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ugge&s;t in Congre&s;s to make them wink at <HI>enormities?</HI> Is it to be inferred from their conduct?&mdash;How has it happened that the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives have been &s;ilent too?

<P>The examples drawn from Rome, of Sylla and of Cae&s;ar are not in point. Cae&s;ar di&s;banded no army, nor Sylla till he had accompli&s;hed the mi&s;chief he meditated.&mdash;How different the conduct of our <HI>greater Cae&s;ar!</HI> Having re&s;tored the Godde&s;s <HI>Liberty</HI> to her country and built her a permanent habitation there, he quietly retires to the rural &s;hade, the glory and wonder of the age. There has indeed been a re|ciprocity of good offices between the American army and their country&mdash;They have ble&s;&s;ed her

<P>Be&s;ides&mdash;the <HI>means</HI> of ri&s;ing to military fame in the Roman republics, was through the channel of civil employments, men figured as &s;tate&s;men in the clo&s;et before they were cho&s;en generals in the field, The means of doing in|jury to their country was con&s;equently greater than in modern republics.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius affects the phra&s;e of <HI>a plain level &s;tate of civil equality.</HI> I dare &s;ay that even Ca&s;&s;ius will not contend that, ab&s;olute, perfect, equal|ity is po&s;&s;ible to the government of any &s;tate. As the mind mu&s;t govern the hands, &s;o the man of intelligence mu&s;t direct the man of labour. Hi&s;tory is the be&s;t &s;chool to improve the minds of the people, and the whole weight of its evidence tends to &s;hew. That infant &s;ociety is always in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate, and that di&s;tinc|tions have been made in all ages, as the re|wards of &s;ervices: and I believe have &s;eldom failed to benefit the country that be&s;towed them. Di&s;tinction nece&s;&s;arily excites a &s;pirit of emulation, a &s;pirit which when once diffu&s;ed among a people, gives vigour to every &s;pring of government and vibration to the heart of every member of the community.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of the order of the Cincinnati is back'd by no power, and con&s;equently at|tended with no danger,&mdash;<HI>The arm of civil au|thority &s;urrounds it</HI>&mdash;only to <HI>will</HI> its de&s;truc|tion
<PB N="21" REF="018073_0020_0FA4B55CB0A3DBC8">
would be in&s;tant annihilation. If this in&s;ti|tution has any tendency to create di&s;tinctions, it is, I again a&s;&s;ert, a di&s;tinction <HI>without power,</HI> and without any other lu&s;tre than what it borrows from virtue. Not like the coro|nets and garters of modern ambition, but anal|agous to the wreath of par&s;ley or of the olive branch which decorated the foreheads of our ancient heroes, di&s;tinctions too which as they are the rewards of merit, reflect an unequalled brilliancy upon the wearer of them.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinctions (it feems) are incon&s;i&s;tent with a republican government&mdash;Why &s;o Ca&s;&s;ius? Every republic confers them&mdash;Is not Hol|land a republic, <HI>rich, free, and powerful?</HI> And has &s;he not a nobility to whom too are confided the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate, civil as well as military?</P>
<P>But the&s;e are trifling flights to the tower|ing Ca&s;&s;ius&mdash;<HI>he</HI> &s;corns deducing his infer|ences from a nearer fountain than from hea|ven it&s;elf, He appeals to Homer and Virgil to prove that Hector, Achilles and Aeneas were &s;et up as idols to be wor&s;hipped by future ge|nerations, and to &s;hew <HI>in what depth of de&s;ign and extent of artifice,</HI> the order of the Cincinnati is founded, INFERS, that, this order will &s;hort|ly receive the &s;ame homage from the people&mdash;In other words&mdash;That the Cincinnati will &s;et them|&s;elves up as <HI>idols,</HI> and the virtuous citizens of America will become <HI>idolaters.</HI> But I beg par|don&mdash;In this he is con&s;i&s;tent, for dealing in <HI>fiction,</HI> it was very natural for him to call in aid the evidence of the mu&s;es.</P>
<P>I beg now to refer the reader to the de&s;crip|tion
<PB N="22" REF="018073_0021_0FA4B55D619EA0E0">
of the order it&s;elf, and the rules of the order, page 6, upon which Ca&s;&s;ius comments with &s;o much triumph. It purports to be an order, in&s;tituted (among others) for the follow|ing purpo&s;es <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<Q><P>To perpetuate the memory of the revolution, their own mutual friend&s;hip, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve inviolate the exalted rights of human nature, for which they have fought and bled.</P>
<P>To promote and cheri&s;h between the re&s;pec|tive &s;tates union and national honour.</P>
<P>To render permanent cordial affection and the &s;pirit of brotherly kindne&s;s among the of|ficers, and to extend acts of beneficence to|wards tho&s;e officers, and their families who may unfortunately be under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiv|ing it, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></Q>
<P>IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO CASSIUS, I ASSERT, That, if words are to be taken in their plain &s;en&s;e and common ac|ceptation, and to be con&s;trued according to their real import, hi&s;tory furni&s;hes <HI>no &s;ingle in|&s;tance</HI> of an in&s;titution more <HI>apparently</HI> the off|&s;pring of PATRIOTISM, FRIENDSHIP, and HUMANITY. To u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a pro|found and elegant writer, IT abounds with &s;entiments which find a mirror in every good mind, and to which every hone&s;t bo&s;om re|turns an echo.</P>
<P>But if on the other hand they are to be ex|plained by <HI>innuendos,</HI> I would not an&s;wer that the &s;ame words did not convey a charge of an intention to murder every citizen of the &s;tate, and devour them afterwards. The Bible

may be made trea&s;on&mdash;and <HI>treachery</HI> extract|ed from the decalogue&mdash;by <HI>con&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>An exten&s;ive knowledge of the common law, was (I dare &s;ay) one of the qualifications that recommended Ca&s;&s;ius to his &s;eat upon the bench. In his judgments from that &s;eat of ele|vation, it is not to be doubted but he &s;trictly adopts its rules as the grounds of his deci&s;ions &mdash;Why omit the practice of them in a &s;erious appeal to the people?

<P>That&mdash;QUOTIES IN VERBIS NULLA EST AMBIGUITAS IBI NULLA EXPOSI|TIO CONTRA VERBA FIENDA EST.&mdash; When the intention is clear, too minute a &s;tre&s;s ought not to be laid upon the preci&s;e &s;ig|nification of words NAM QUE HAERET IN LITERA, HAERET IN CORTICE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Query. Has not the neglect of this rule occa&s;ioned Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ometimes (as we emphatically expre&s;s it) to STICK IN THE MUD.</NOTE></P>
<P>And la&s;tly&mdash;THAT THE CONSTRUC|TION BE NOT MADE UPON DISJOINT|ED PARTS, BUT ON THE WHOLE TO|GETHER.</P>
<P>If the intention of the Order is apparently innocent in the WORDS of the in&s;titution, this very obvious que&s;tion very naturally ari&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="018073_0023_0FA4B55EE3B6F1C0">Has every &s;ingle ACT of the &s;ociety tended to ground a &s;u&s;picion or apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences &s;ugge&s;ted?</P>
<P>What! Every tongue locked in &s;ilence!</P>
<P>If Ca&s;&s;ius had not known (as a lawyer) HU|MANITY might have told told him (as a man) <HI>that the pre&s;umption of inocence, ought always to precede the imputation of guilt.</HI> Let Ca&s;&s;ius <HI>fro|lic in conjecture</HI> as much as he plea&s;es, his &s;up|po&s;itions are as unfavourable to him as his facts. The good &s;en&s;e of the people will only be led by rea&s;on and argument, and not the labour of the mo&s;t minute re&s;earches of the mo&s;t micro&s;copic eye, will &s;econd his di&s;coveries. No great depth of de&s;ign will ever be found in the in&s;titution of the order of the Cincinnati. For my own part I concur in the remark of a very attentive ob&s;erv|er of human life. "That a &s;oldier &s;eldom looks further forward than to the end of his mu&s;ket or backwards beyond his knap&s;ack."</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius would di&s;cover &s;ingular ingenuity in in reconciling the following contradictions.</P>
<P>The citizens of America (altho' they fought and bled as well as the Cincinnati) are already (&s;ays Ca&s;&s;ius) <HI>as much below them as the earth is below the Heavens.</HI> Yet this vile medal and ribband would &s;et the Cincinnati SO MUCH HIGHER <HI>that it would very ju&s;tly excite the jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion of every man throughout the continent.</HI></P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius's Sagacity has di&s;covered (page 3 of his pamphlet) that in all great &s;ocieties there are <HI>&s;ome</HI> bad men, and con&s;equently that there are men of that de&s;cription among the Cincinnati, yet (in page 9) <HI>were their country as well ac|quainted
<PB N="25" REF="018073_0024_0FA4B5613663CC30">
as I am</HI> (&s;ays Ca&s;&s;ius) <HI>with the temper of</HI> GOODNESS <HI>and humanity which runs thro' the</HI> WHOLE OF THEM, <HI>they would be as much beloved as they are admired.</HI></P>
<P>Can the &s;ame people excite love, admirati|on and SUSPICION?</P>
<P>The <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> upon which he grounds his ap|prehen&s;ions are &s;ingularly novel, namely, <HI>the uncommon merit of the officers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Had they,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>le&s;s merit and claim to the applau&s;e of their countrymen at home and fame a|broad, I &s;hould not be alarmed, &amp;c. Men of lit|tle worth,</HI> (i. e. bad men) COULD NOT <HI>ren|der this in&s;titution detrimental to the freedom of their country, but it mu&s;t be remembered</HI> (and I heartily join my prayers that it may never be FORGOTTEN) <Q>That a &s;eries of hardy gallant &s;pirited actions through a fierce and de&s;perate con|flict, through toil and &s;ufferings, and their pa|tience under them, and above all the glorious &s;uc|ce&s;s which crowned the whole, have rendered the officers of the American army the mo&s;t renowned band of men that this day walk on the globe.</Q></P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius is certain that <HI>this dreadful in&s;titution will entail on the people of America all the evils he has &s;tated, and that he has</HI> PROVED <HI>it, to the &s;atisfaction of every one,</HI> NEVERTHELESS <HI>he has not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea that it will ever come to a di&s;&s;olution.</HI></P>
<P>Might it not be a&s;ked then, why Ca&s;&s;ius did not &s;pare him&s;elf &s;o much trouble. If it could not an&s;wer a good purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t an&s;wer a bad one, namely, that of giving the people <HI>(fruitle&s;s)</HI> unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius concludes with ob&s;erving, that al|though
<PB N="26" REF="018073_0025_0FA4B562DFB3AD48">
his remarks may appear trivial to &s;ome of his readers, that they are worthy, in his opinion, the attention of the philo&s;opher and hi&s;torian. They &s;erve to &s;hew, &s;ays he, <Q>that the freedom of a country may be overturned by cau&s;es imperceptible to the multitude.</Q></P>
<P>The matter &s;eems to HINGE upon this que&s;tion, viz. Are the people &s;uch as Ca&s;&s;ius repre&s;ents them or not? i. e. Are they thought|le&s;s, ignorant and inattentive to the mo&s;t im|portant concerns; or are they, on the contrary, vigilant, active, attentive, and jealous of every thing that has relation to government?</P>
<P>I contend for the truth of the latter &s;up|po&s;ition; and if that is the ca&s;e, what danger can threaten or invade a people, who conquer|ed the arms of Britain; who fought and bled with the Cincinnati&mdash;Men who could protect their country &s;o invaded from <HI>without,</HI> are &s;urely competent to the ta&s;k of defending it from <HI>within.</HI></P>
<P>That a free people are ever vigilant and &s;u&s;picious of the &s;lighte&s;t inva&s;ion of their rights, may be deduced from every volume of hi&s;tory, the power (I had almo&s;t &s;aid the Omnipotence) of the people (when that &s;u&s;|picion is once awakened) from every page. To take two examples out of a thou&s;and: this appears &s;trongly from the revolution of England, in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">60; and of Holland, in the year 1672. The fir&s;t is in the know|ledge of the meane&s;t citizen of the continent. <Q>The u&s;urped powers that had either de|&s;igned no root, or at lea&s;t drawn none, but in the affections and intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who
<PB N="27" REF="018073_0026_0FA4B5644E222230">
were engaged with the government, thought them&s;elves &s;ecure in the &s;trength of an un|foiled army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, and in a revenue proportionable, rai&s;ed by the awe of their forces, though with the mock forms of legal &s;upplies; yet they were forced to give way to the vent and current humour of the people.</Q> And this mighty army lo&s;e their heart and their intere&s;t, and content them&s;elves to be again moulded into the ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>THE COMMON PEOPLE (&s;ays Sir Wil|liam Temple) con&s;titute the bulk and &s;trength of all great kingdoms.&mdash;Whenever they con|&s;pire and unite in one common pa&s;&s;ion or in|tere&s;t, for the nobles without them are like an army of officers without &s;oldiers, and make on|ly a vain &s;hew unle&s;s rai&s;ed and encrea&s;ed by the VOICE OF THE PEOPLE which for this rea&s;on is called THE VOICE OF GOD.</P>
<P>To go back into Engli&s;h hi&s;tory&mdash;Wil|liam the Conqueror experienced this truth in the many troubles of his reign, and which would have proved fatal to him if he had been di&s;tracted with the common di&s;contents of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>SOME of Ca&s;&s;ius's arguments may look flattering to the eye, but when brought to the te&s;t of palpability, they elude the touch and melt in idle air.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="018073_0027_0FA4B56619F0EA38">The &s;ervices RECEIVED by the &s;tates from the American army, are not denied&mdash;They &s;tand alone, unparalleled in hi&s;tory.&mdash;The only recompence expected is&mdash;A MEDAL AND A RIBBAND, TO PERPETUATE THE RECORD OF THEM.</P>
