<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Dare &s;ay, the reader has already concluded, that the author of <HI>Plain Engli&s;h</HI> can be no other than an En|gli&s;hman; and, I can a&s;&s;ure him, the further he advances, the more will he be confirmed in his opinion. It would then, be u&s;ele&s;s to deny the fact.</P>
<P>The <HI>Democrats</HI> have loaded me with every name which they imagine to be opprobrious, (but of which I am very proud) &s;uch, for example, as Ari&s;tocrat, King'sman, Loyali&s;t, Roya|li&s;t, Clergyman, Engli&s;hman, &amp;c. it is, therefore, no more than fair play for me to choo&s;e from among&s;t them that which &s;uits me be&s;t. <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is the one I have preferred on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion; becau&s;e, as an Engli&s;hman, I have not been obliged to declaim with enthu&s;ia&s;m on the inexhau&s;tible riches, the genero&s;ity and humanity of the French Republicans; as an Engli&s;hman, I have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to my advancement, to varni&s;h over the follies and errors of a certain part of &s;ocie|ty,
<PB N="6" REF="028437_0005_0FD9011CCDA750C8">
in the&s;e States; as an Engli&s;hman, I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for not thinking my|&s;elf upon a level with every <HI>patriot,</HI> e|very <HI>negro,</HI> and every <HI>democrat,</HI> that plea&s;es to call me his <HI>fellow citizen;</HI> as an Engli&s;hman, as a calf of <HI>John Bull,</HI> I &s;hall hope to be permitted, in &s;hort, I will be permitted, to bellow out the truth without di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Methinks, I hear the reader exclaim: <HI>what! the conduct of General Wa&s;hington defended by an Engli&s;hman!</HI> For my part, I cannot &s;ee how it can be more offen&s;ive to a real American to hear the conduct of the Pre&s;ident defended by an Engli&s;hman, than to hear it condemn|ed by a Frenchman. If meddling be at all commendable, it certainly is as much &s;o in the former as in the latter ca&s;e. But, the reader need not alarm him&s;elf. He will not be di&s;gu&s;ted with nau&s;eous panegyrics on GENERAL WASHING|TON. I have not treated him as the CRAWLING DEMAGOGUES of this coun|try treat the &s;overeign people. If the GENERAL'S character or conduct &s;tood in need of defence, it would not find a defender in me. In my an&s;wer to Franklin, on this &s;ubject, I have had the &s;ame object in view, that I have had in

view in every other &s;entence I have yet publi&s;hed; what that object is, I &s;hall leave for the &s;agacious democrats to find out.</P>
<P>From the volumes, or rather bales, that have already appeared again&s;t the treaty, I have &s;elected the "Letters of Franklin," not becau&s;e they are the wor&s;t things that have been written on the &s;ubject, and, God knows, it is not becau&s;e they are the be&s;t; but becau&s;e they contain upon the whole, the fair|e&s;t &s;ample, I have yet &s;een, of the opi|nions and language of the oppo&s;ers of the treaty.</P>
<P>I will, with the reader's leave, clo&s;e this preface with an ob&s;ervation, which, though rather foreign to the &s;ubject before us, is neverthele&s;s nearly enough connected with democratic affairs to be worthy of a place.</P>
<P>This very day, a twelve month a|go, the bells of this City were ringing, the cannons firing, <HI>Tom the Tinker</HI> to|ping, bawling, and dancing <HI>&agrave; la canibale</HI> round the altar of <HI>La Libert&eacute;,</HI> and eve|ry blackguard in the City rolling drunk about the &s;treet, to celebrate that happy event the de&s;truction of LOUIS XVI.

<HEAD>A LITTLE PLAIN ENGLISH, ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>A TREATY of amity, commerce, and navigation, with Great Britain, is a thing which has been &s;o long and &s;o ardently de&s;ired on your part, and &s;o often &s;olicited by your government, that one cannot help being a&s;toni&s;hed that even the <HI>democratic,</HI> or <HI>French, faction</HI> &s;hould have the temerity to rai&s;e a cry again&s;t it, now it is brought &s;o near a conclu&s;ion. It is true, this perver&s;e faction is extremely contemptible, as to the property they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the real weight they have in the community; and their di&s;&s;atisfaction, which is &s;ure to accompany every mea&s;ure of the Federal Government, is a pretty certain
<PB N="2" REF="028437_0009_0FD9012D36A55D58">
&s;ign of the general approbation of tho&s;e who may be properly called <HI>the people:</HI> but, it mu&s;t be acknowledged at the &s;ame time, that they have for partizans almo&s;t the whole of that de&s;cription of per&s;ons, who, among us royali&s;ts, are generally de&s;ignated by the name of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ob.</HI> Being an enemy to the ad|mini&s;tration, be it what it may, is always a &s;ufficient recommendation with the&s;e latter, and is looked upon as an ample compen&s;ation for a lo&s;t reputation or a want of talents. Tho&s;e who are &s;imple enough to li&s;ten to a demagogue, don't care much about his mo|ral character. With the rights of the <HI>citizens,</HI> their virtue, and their &s;overeignty, eternally vibrating on his lips, he may, for ought they care, have a heart as black as Tartarus. If he writes, let him fill his pages with frothy de|clamation, and vaunting bomba&s;t, with the canting jargon of modern republicans, and it matters little what arrangement he makes u&s;e of. Ambiguity and confu&s;ion are even an advantage to him, they are a labyrinth in which he lo&s;es the wretches whom he has enticed from their duty. In &s;hort, his bu&s;ine&s;s is to awaken in his reader, jealou&s;y, envy, revenge, and every pa&s;&s;ion that can di&s;grace the heart of man, to lull his gratitude, rea&s;on, and con&s;cience, a&s;leep, and then let him loo&s;e upon &s;ociety. Such is the eloquence, and &s;uch the object of <HI>Franklin.</HI></P>
<P>Far be it from me to pretend to a rival&s;hip with this fawning mob orator; I would not for the world make one convert from his tat|tered
<PB N="3" REF="028437_0010_0FD901322F359A10">
flock; unenvied I leave him to the plau|dits of his cajoled <Q><HI>fellow citizens,</HI> and the fra|ternal hugs of your <HI>in&s;idious friends and allies.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is become a kind of e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, even among tho&s;e who are the firm friends of your government, to yield to the prejudice of the populace, in pa&s;&s;ing eulogiums on the reign|ing powers in France; or, at lea&s;t, in ob&s;erv|ing a cautious &s;ilence with re&s;pect to their in|&s;idious, not to &s;ay ho&s;tile, conduct towards the United States. The&s;e gentlemen have, un|doubtedly their rea&s;ons for this; for my part, I have none, and therefore I &s;hall take the li|berty to &s;ay what, I am &s;ure they mu&s;t think on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On all hands it is allowed, that the para&s;ite of a prince is a mo&s;t de&s;picable character; a popular para&s;ite mu&s;t then be doubly de&s;picable. It is po&s;&s;ible for the &s;upple courtier to find &s;ome|thing like an apology for his &s;elf-humiliation; one may be dazzled by the &s;plendour of a crown, or blinded by the munificence of a friend and protector; but what mu&s;t be the man (if, indeed, he be worthy of the name,) who can crawl to the dregs of mankind? Who can make a voluntary &s;urrender of the &s;uperiority with which nature has endowed him; who can &s;acrifice truth, honour, ju&s;tice, and even com|mon &s;en&s;e, to the &s;tupid &s;tare and momentary huzza of the populace, of the populace who&s;e welfare affects him not, and whom, in his heart, he de&s;pi&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028437_0011_0FD90136F46350E0">The <HI>Letters of Franklin</HI> are a &s;tring of philli|pics again&s;t Great Britain and the Executive of the United States. They do not form a regular &s;eries, in which the &s;ubject is treated in conti|nuation: the fir&s;t &s;eems to be the overflowings of pa&s;&s;ion bordering on in&s;anity, and each &s;uc|ceeding one the fruit of a relap&s;e. To follow the author &s;tep by &s;tep through &s;uch a jumble, would be to product the &s;ame kind of di&s;gu&s;t in you as I my&s;elf have experienced; I &s;hall therefore deviate from the order, or rather di&s;order, which <HI>Franklin</HI> has found it conve|nient to employ, and endeavour to bring the &s;ubject before you in a le&s;s complicated point of view.</P>
<P>The cen&s;ure of <HI>Franklin</HI> has three principal objects; the treating with Great Britain at all, the terms of the treaty, and the conduct of the Pre&s;ident relative to the negociation.</P>
<P N="1">I. He a&s;&s;erts, that to form a commercial treaty, with Great Britain is a &s;tep, at once unnece&s;&s;ary, impolitic, dangerous and di&s;ho|nourable.</P>
<P N="2">II. That, if forming a treaty with Great Bri|tain were con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy, the terms of the pre&s;ent treaty are di&s;advantage|ous, humiliating and di&s;graceful to the United States.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, &s;uppo&s;ing the terms of the treaty to be what every good American ought to ap|prove, yet the conduct of the Pre&s;ident, rela|tive to the negociation and promulgation of it, has been highly improper, and even monarchi|cal, and, for which, he de&s;erves to be <HI>impeached.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028437_0012_0FD9013B44612F70">If <HI>Franklin</HI> has made out any one of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, if he has proved, that to treat with Great Britain is unnece&s;&s;ary, impolitic, dangerous and di&s;honourable, that the terms of the pre&s;ent treaty are di&s;advantageous, hu|miliating and di&s;graceful, or that the Pre&s;ident has pur&s;ued a conduct in the negociation for which he de&s;erves to be impeached, you will all do well to join the remon&s;trating throng, that are now hunting the good Old General to his retreat at Mount Vernon; but if he has proved none of the&s;e; if all that he has &s;aid on the &s;ubject be mere cavilling and abu&s;e, &s;colding, reviling, and execrating; if he be every where detected of mi&s;repre&s;entation, incon&s;i&s;tency, and flat contradiction; if, in &s;hort it appears, that his ultimate object is to &s;tir up the unwary to an indecent and even vi|olent oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Federal Govern|ment, then, if you con&s;ult your own intere&s;ts, you will be upon your guard, and weigh well the con&s;equences, before you determine on &s;uch an oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Franklin a&s;&s;erts, that to form a commercial treaty with Great Britain is a &s;tep, at once un|nece&s;&s;ary, impolitic, dangerous, and di&s;honourable.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary,</HI> becau&s;e <Q>commercial treaties are an artificial means to obtain a natu|ral end. They are the &s;wathing bands of com|merce, that impede the free operations of nature.</Q> This will not detain us long; it is one of tho&s;e chimerical notions that &s;o well characterize the Pari&s;ian &s;chool. Nobody but a &s;et of philo&s;o|phical politicians ever imagined the plan of o|pening
<PB N="6" REF="028437_0013_0FD9013F50BEAEA0">
all the ports in the world to all the ve&s;|&s;els in the world, <Q>of interweaving and con|founding the intere&s;ts of all nations, of form|ing the inhabitants of the earth into one va&s;t republic, of rendering the whole family of mankind enlightened, free, and happy.</Q> When this plan &s;hall be put in execution with &s;ucce&s;s, I will allow that commercial treaties are unnece&s;&s;ary, but 'till then, I mu&s;t contend for the contrary.</P>
<P><Q>The two countries, &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> if nece&s;&s;ary in their products to each other, will &s;eek an intercour&s;e.</Q> This is all I wanted him to admit, to prove that an exchange of com|modities between our countries is nece&s;&s;ary; for that they have &s;ought an intercour&s;e with each other, and that they do now &s;eek that inter|cour&s;e more than ever, is mo&s;t certain; &s;o much &s;o with re&s;pect to this country that about one half of her exports are now made to Great Bri|tain and her dominions. But &s;ays he, <Q>this ex|change ought to be left to it&s;elf; for the com|merce of nations ought to be like the trade be|tween individuals, who deal with tho&s;e who give them the be&s;t treatment and the be&s;t bargains.</Q> I &s;ub&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice of the latter part of this remark with all my heart: nothing could be more convenient for my pur|po&s;e; for if nations, like individuals, trade with tho&s;e who treat them be&s;t, and give them the be&s;t bargains, how much better treatment and better bargains mu&s;t you receive from Great Britain than from other nations, when you pur|cha&s;e from her three times as much as from all
<PB N="7" REF="028437_0014_0FD90142387E91F8">
the re&s;t of the world put together? But, that this exten&s;ive exchange, however nece&s;&s;ary to both parties, &s;hould be left to regulate it&s;elf, I cannot believe; for, keeping up the compari|&s;on, the commerce of nations being like the trade between individuals, it will ever be found I believe, that treaties are as nece&s;&s;ary to a con|tinuance of good under&s;tanding in the former as written contracts are in the latter.</P>
<P>In ob&s;ervation pre&s;erve it&s;elf here, which mu&s;t not be omitted. <HI>Franklin</HI> objects to form|ing a treaty with Great Britain, becau&s;e, &s;ays he, <Q>She is famed for perfidy and double deal|ing, her polar &s;tar is intere&s;t, artifice with her is a &s;ub&s;titute for nature, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> God knows if all this, and much more that he has &s;aid, be true; but, if it be, I am &s;ure it makes &s;trongly for a treaty, in place of again&s;t one; for, proceeding &s;till upon his own compari&s;on, <Q>that commerce between nations is like trade between individuals,</Q> certainly no individual would ever think of dealing to any amount, with a per&s;on famed for perfidy and double dealing, without binding him down by written articles.</P>
<P>Out of this observation grows another of not le&s;s importance. <HI>Franklin</HI> has taken an infinite deal of pains to per&s;uade you that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould have formed a treaty with France in&s;tead of Great Britain? Your commerce with France, even in the faire&s;t days of her pro&s;peri|ty, never amounted to more than a fifth part of your commerce with Great Britain; and if what <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;ays be true, France is the mo&s;t magnanimous, generous, ju&s;t, honourable, <HI>(hu|mane!)</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="028437_0015_0FD901496A7C24F8">
rich, and powerful nation upon the earth; and can you then want a written bargain with France, when a mere trifle is the object, and none with Great Britain, when half you have is at &s;take? Shall it be &s;aid that you di&s;tru&s;t France, that honourable, that <HI>rich</HI> nation? that you bind her down with "hard biting laws," while you admit Great Britain, "who&s;e days," <HI>Franklin</HI> a&s;&s;ures you, "are numbered," to a kind of family intercour&s;e, where the bands of affection are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;upply the place of law?</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> incautiou&s;ly acknowledges, <Q>that you repeatedly &s;olicited a commercial trea|ty with Great Britain,</Q> and this is very true. The fir&s;t que&s;tion put to <HI>Mr. Ham|mond,</HI> on his arrival here, was to know, if he was authorized to treat on that &s;ubject. This was al&s;o the o&s;ten&s;ible object of <HI>Mr. Ma|di&s;on's</HI> famous re&s;olutions. <Q>To force the nations of Europe, and particularly Great Britain, to enter into commercial treaties with you</Q>. The words <HI>nations of Europe</HI> were afterwards changed for <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The&s;e re&s;olutions were a long time and are &s;till, a favourite theme of panegyric among the French Faction; all the <HI>democratic &s;ocieties</HI> in the union have pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olves in approba|bation of them; they have been toa&s;ted at every patriotic dinner, every civic fea&s;t, and even our <HI>Franklin</HI> him&s;elf &s;ings forth their prai&s;es. How comes it then, that all the&s;e people now deprecate the idea of making a treaty with Great Britain? This will be no
<PB N="9" REF="028437_0016_0FD9014A78D16900">
longer a &s;ecret, when <HI>Patriot Madi&s;on's</HI> real object is known, and to know this you have only to compare his re&s;olutions with a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Citizen Genet's</HI> in&s;tructions. The fact is is, <HI>Patriot Madi&s;on</HI> had no &s;uch thing as a treaty in view; nothing on earth was further from his wi&s;hes. War was his object; but this he could not propo&s;e in direct terms, and therefore, he propo&s;ed &s;uch re&s;trictions on the Briti&s;h commerce, as he was &s;ure, if adopted, would produce a war. He failed, and Great Britain, in con&s;enting to what he pretended was the object of his re&s;olutions, and the Pre|&s;ident and &s;enate in ratifying it, are now load|ed with the execrations of all his partizans. But what mu&s;t be the <HI>Patriot's</HI> remor&s;e? What will he be able to &s;ay again&s;t treating with a nation, whom he wi&s;hed <HI>to force to a treaty</HI> with you?</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>Treaties are impolitic, becau&s;e they lead to to war: and con&s;equently a treaty with Great Bri|tain is exceptionable on that account.</HI> This is ano|ther idea borrowed from the legi&s;lators of your Si&s;ter Republic, and &s;urely it is not, for that rea|&s;on, le&s;s whim&s;ical. "Treaties lead to war," &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> "and war is the bane of republican government." Treaties of alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive lead to war, it is their object; but how treaties of <HI>amity, commerce,</HI> and <HI>navigation,</HI> can lead to war; how a treaty like that under con&s;ideration, made expre&s;ly to terminate all dif|ferences in an amicable manner, to produce &s;a|tisfaction and good under&s;tanding, to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="028437_0017_0FD9014F35483A70">
univer&s;al peace and true friend&s;hip between the parties, how a treaty like this can lead to war, is, to me, inconceivable. With ju&s;t as much rea|&s;on might it be &s;aid that treaties of peace lead to to war, that independence leads to &s;ubjugation, that liberty leads to &s;lavery, and that good leads to evil.</P>
<P><Q>Treaties, &s;ays our Demagogue, are like partner&s;hips, they e&s;tabli&s;h intimacies, which &s;ometimes end in profligacy, and &s;ome|times in ruin and bankruptcy, di&s;tru&s;t, &s;trife, and quarrel;</Q> and then on he goes with an a|bu&s;ive apo&s;trophe (which decency prevents me from copying here) inferring that you ought, on this account, to avoid a connection, as he terms it, with Great Britain. This compari&s;on is not &s;o good as the la&s;t we quoted; treaties of amity and commerce do not at all re&s;emble part|ner&s;hips. "The commerce of nations is like trade between individuals;" but commercial treaties re&s;emble contracts between individuals of &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and not co-partner&s;hips. A co-partner&s;hip implies an union of intere&s;ts, a participation in profits and lo&s;&s;es, in debts and credits. Are any of the&s;e under&s;tood by a com|mercial treaty? A&s;&s;uredly not. In a com|mercial treaty two nations &s;ay: <HI>on the&s;e terms we will buy and &s;ell, of and to each other.</HI> Had you made a treaty with Great Britain to club your merchandize and revenues, and to carry on trade under the firm of Madam Britain and Mi&s;s America, &s;uch a treaty would, indeed, have re&s;embled a partner&s;hip, and would very proba|bly have been attended with all the inconveni|encies,
<PB N="11" REF="028437_0018_0FD90151FB292C10">
&s;tated by <HI>Franklin;</HI> but commercial trea|ties are, I repeat it, among nations what written bargains are among individuals, and the former have exactly the &s;ame tendency as the latter, that is, to render mi&s;takes, di&s;putes, and quar|rels, le&s;s frequent.</P>
<P>But, however, even if treaties do lead to war, it is rather &s;urprizing to hear <HI>Franklin</HI> ob|ject to them on that account, when one third part of his book is taken up with invectives again&s;t the Pre&s;ident for not forming a treaty with France, the direct object of which was your tak|ing a part with her in the pre&s;ent war. <Q>The treaty propo&s;ed by Citizen Genet, &s;ays he, was a treaty on liberal and equitable princi|ples.</Q> What were the&s;e liberal principles now? Citizen Genet came forward with an offer to treat, which offer, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed contain|ed no expre&s;s de&s;ire of involving you in a war; but what were the Citizen's private in&s;tructions concerning this treaty? for it is from the&s;e that you are to judge, and not from the contents of a mere complimentary letter.

<P>It is not my object to intrude on you my opinion of the <HI>fa&s;hions, forms,</HI> and <HI>precedents,</HI> as <HI>Franklin</HI> calls them, of the Briti&s;h govern|ment; they may be better or they may be wor&s;e than tho&s;e of other governments; but be they what they may, they are nearly the &s;ame as your own, and they are the only ones, ever adopted by any nation on earth, to which

<P>But, I &s;hould like to be told how <HI>Franklin</HI> came to di&s;cover a re&s;emblance between your government and that of France, or between you and the French. To &s;ay that &s;uch a re&s;em|blance exi&s;ts is a trait of &s;lander that, were I an American, I &s;hould re&s;ent with the utmo&s;t in|dignation. Are you governed by an a&s;&s;embly of ignorant caballing legi&s;lators? An a&s;&s;embly of <HI>Neroes,</HI> who&s;e pa&s;time is murder, who have defied the God of Heaven, and, in idea, have &s;natched the thunder from his hand to hurl it on a crouching people? And do you re&s;emble the republican French? Have you ca&s;t off the very &s;emblance of virtue and religion? Do you indeed, re&s;emble tho&s;e men of blood, tho&s;e profligate infidels, who, uniting the frivolity of the Monkey to the ferocity of the Tyger, can go dancing to the gallows, or butcher their relations to the air of <HI>ah, &ccedil;a ira?</HI> If you do, you have not much to fear from the in|troduction of the <HI>fa&s;hions, forms,</HI> and <HI>precedents</HI> of other nations.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of <HI>danger,</HI> that <HI>Franklin</HI> has had the &s;agacity to di&s;cover in treating with Great Britain, is, that, <Q>&s;he meditates your &s;ubjugation, and a treaty will give her a footing among&s;t you which &s;he had not before, and facilitate her plans.</Q> The ex|ecutive council of France ordered <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> to tell you &s;omething of this &s;ort, in order to induce you to embark in the war for the liber|ty and happine&s;s of mankind. <Q>In this &s;itua|tion

of affairs," &s;ay the Executive Council, "when the military preparations in Great Britain become every day more &s;erious, we ought to excite, <HI>by all po&s;&s;ible means,</HI> the zeal of the Americans, who are as much intere&s;ted as our&s;elves in di&s;concerting the de&s;tructive projects of <HI>George III,</HI> in which they are pro|bably an object.</Q> I be&s;eech you to pay atten|tion to this pa&s;&s;age of the in&s;tructions. When military preparations were making again&s;t France, &s;he wanted your aid, and &s;o the good Citizen was ordered to tell you that you were the object of tho&s;e preparations.

<P>You have the &s;ure&s;t of all guarantees that Great Britain will never attempt any thing again&s;t your independence, <HI>her intere&s;t.</HI> I agree with <HI>Franklin,</HI> that <Q>her intere&s;t is the main &s;pring of all her actions, and that, had not her intere&s;t been implicated, the commercial relation between you and her would long &s;ince have been de&s;troyed</Q> Her intere&s;t will ever dictate to her to keep up that relation, and certainly making an attempt on your independance is not the way to do that; for, as to her &s;ucceeding in &s;uch an attempt, I think every American will look on that as impo&s;&s;ible.

<P>And yet this &s;ame <HI>Franklin,</HI> who tells you that the <Q>days of Great Britain are number|ed, that &s;he is upon the point of annihilation, and that nothing can &s;ave her but repentance in &s;ack-cloth and a&s;hes;</Q> this &s;ame <HI>Frank|lin,</HI> who &s;ays all this, and much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; this &s;ame <HI>Franklin</HI> winds up almo&s;t every one of his letters in declaring, that you have every thing to fear from her, and that nothing on earth can &s;ave you but France! <Q>That gallant nation, who&s;e proffers we have neglected, is the &s;heet anchor who &s;u&s;tains our hopes, and &s;hould her glorious exertions be incompetent to the great object &s;he has in view, we have little to flatter our&s;elves with from the faith, honour, or ju&s;tice of Great Britain.&mdash;The nation on whom our political exi&s;tence depends we have treated with indifference bordering on contempt. &mdash;Citizens your only &s;ecurity depends upon <HI>France,</HI> and, by the conduct of your go|vernment, that &s;ecurity has become precari|ous.</Q> Now before I go any further, I &s;hall bring another &s;entence from <HI>Franklin,</HI> which will certainly give you a favourable idea of the veracity and con&s;i&s;tency of that Demagogue. <Q>In&s;ulated as we are, not an enemy near to excite apprehen&s;ion, and our products &s;uch as are indi&s;pen&s;able, <HI>we need neither the coun|tenance of other countries, nor their &s;upport!</HI></Q> What! no enemy near to excite apprehen&s;ion,

<P>If Great Britain had really been &s;o fooli&s;h as to form a de&s;ign upon your independence, and your political exi&s;tence had depended upon France, it would, I believe, have been at an end long before this time. <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> was ordered to promi&s;e you, that his coun|try would <Q>&s;end to the American ports a &s;ufficient force to put them beyond in&s;ult;</Q> but, if they had defended your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions no better than they have their own, they would have brought you into a poor plight. If the fleet, they were &s;o good as to offer you had been no more &s;ucce&s;sful than the others they have &s;ent out, it might as well have re|mained at home, blocked up, as their fleets now are, and left you to the defence of your own privateers. They have given but a poor &s;ample of their <HI>protecting talents,</HI> either at home or abroad. Letting two thirds of their colonies be taken from them, and making war upon the re&s;t them&s;elves, is not the way to convince me that you would have been &s;afe under their protection.

any rea&s;on at all, for your not treating with the nation who has committed them.

The par|tizans of France, and <HI>Franklin</HI> among the re&s;t, were for demanding &s;atisfaction in &s;uch a man|ner as they knew it would not be granted, in a manner that Great Britain, con&s;i&s;tent with her honour (for I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed for think|ing &s;he has &s;ome left) could not grant it; but, mu&s;t not a treaty have been the con&s;e|quence, at la&s;t? Suppo&s;e they had &s;ucceeded in plunging you into a war, that war it&s;elf mu&s;t have ended in <HI>a treaty,</HI> and a treaty much more <HI>di&s;honourable,</HI> perhaps, than the one now negociated; unle&s;s, indeed, their intention was to wage a <HI>bellum eternum,</HI> &s;ide by &s;ide with their French brethren, till there &s;hould be no government left to treat with. The&s;e people are always for violent mea&s;ures; they wanted a commercial treaty with Great Britain, but then &s;he was to be "forced" into it; and now again they wanted &s;atisfaction, but it is not worth a farthing, becau&s;e no violence has been u&s;ed to obtain it. They are of the ta&s;te of <HI>Swift's</HI> <Q>true Engli&s;h dean that was hang|ed for a rape;</Q> though they have all their hearts can wi&s;h for, their depraved appetites render it loath&s;ome, becau&s;e it has been yielded to them without a &s;truggle.</P>
<P>But, it is, or ought to be, the opinion of <HI>Franklin</HI> him&s;elf, that depredations on your
<PB N="27" REF="028437_0034_0FD901808111AA98">
commerce ought to be no bar to your trea|ting with the nation who has committed them; for he has exhau&s;ted him&s;elf to per&s;uade you, that a treaty ought to have been made with France, and yet it is notorious, that her depre|dations have very far out&s;tripped tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h. Within the la&s;t five or &s;ix months the French have &s;eized upwards of 200 of your ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome they have confi&s;cated, others they have relea&s;ed after having taken their cargoes, and others are yet in &s;u&s;pence. Many of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els have been &s;eized in their own ports, where they went in full confidence, and with the mo&s;t upright intentions. The mariners have been thrown into pri&s;on, where many of them now are; the ma&s;ters have been robbed, &s;trip|ped, and beaten, by &s;ome of the vile&s;t wretches that ever exi&s;ted. They have the in&s;olence to call the American Ma&s;ters, <HI>the caned Captains;</HI> "Les capitaines &aacute; coup de b&agrave;ton." Let <HI>Franklin</HI> find you, if he can, an in&s;tance of an American &s;hip being &s;eized at &s;ea, by the Engli&s;h, and burnt, without further ceremony. The&s;e things the French have done, and yet he would not think it <HI>di&s;honourable</HI> to enter into a treaty with them.</P>
<P>I know, I &s;hall be told, that the depredations of the French, here mentioned, have taken place &s;ince the departure of <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> for Great Britain; we will, then, confine our&s;elves to the depredations, committed by the two nations at that epoch. And here, luckily, we have not to

depend upon rumour, upon news-paper report: we have a &s;ure guide, the report of the Secre|tary of State to the Pre&s;ident, which was com|municated to the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives on the 5th, of March, 1795.</P>
<P><Q>Again&s;t the French it is urged; 1&s;t. that their privateers harra&s;s our trade <HI>no le&s;s than tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h.</HI> 2d. that two of <HI>their &s;hips of war have committed enormities on our ve&s;&s;els.</HI> 3d. that their courts of admiralty are guilty of <HI>equal oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI> 4th that, be&s;ides the&s;e points of accu&s;ation, which are common to the French and Briti&s;h, the French have in|fringed the treaties between the United States and them, by &s;ubjecting to &s;eizure and condemnation our ve&s;&s;els trading with their enemies in merchandize, which that treaty declares not to be contraband, and under circum&s;tances not forbidden by the law of nations. 5th. that a very detrimental em|bargo has been laid on our ve&s;&s;els in French ports. 6th. that a contract with the French government for coin has been di&s;charged in depreciated a&s;&s;ignats.</Q></P>
<P>If then the French privateers had harra&s;&s;ed your trade no le&s;s than tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h, if their &s;hips of war al&s;o had committed enormi|ties on your ve&s;&s;els, if their courts of admi|ralty had been guilty of equal oppre&s;&s;ion, and if they had, be&s;ides, infringed the treaty already exi&s;ting between you, had embargoed your ve&s;|&s;els, and cheated your merchants by di&s;charg|ing a contract for ca&s;h in depreciated a&s;&s;ignats, what could you &s;ee in their conduct to invite

you to a treaty with them, whil&s;t a treaty with Great Britain would, on account of the depre|dations committed by her, be <HI>di&s;honourable?</HI></P>
<P>On this &s;ubject <HI>Franklin</HI> takes occa&s;ion to in|troduce one of his Conventional threats. <Q>As long, &s;ays he, as we kept up the farce, that the negociation was de&s;igned to produce, an indemnity for the pa&s;t, and &s;ecurity for the future, &s;o long did France not <HI>com|plain;</HI> but now we have abandoned it to the &s;ame uncertainty as before, and have favour|ed Great Britain at her expence, &s;he cannot, &s;he will not <HI>be pa&s;&s;ive;</HI> and then he &s;ays, if France &s;hould act <HI>as our conduct merits,</HI> &s;he will <HI>now</HI> &s;eize our ve&s;&s;els.</Q> Without enquir|ing here what rea&s;on France can have to com|plain about <HI>your</HI> not having obtained an indem|nity for <HI>your</HI> lo&s;&s;es; without inquiring how your conduct merits <HI>her</HI> re&s;entment, becau&s;e you have abandoned <HI>your</HI> commerce to the &s;ame un|certainty as before; without inquiring what &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to do, you have only to look at what &s;he has done, and you have no rea&s;on to fear that the treaty will encrea&s;e her depredations. In &s;hort, ever &s;ince the French found, that your government was determined not to join them in the war, they have neglected no opportunity of doing you mi&s;chief, wherever they could, and dared to do it, and, perhaps, it is owing to the Bri|ti&s;h Freebooter (as <HI>Franklin</HI> calls <HI>Admiral Mur|ray</HI>), that you are not now blocked up in your ports. I know nothing of the Briti&s;h Admiral's in&s;tructions; perhaps they were no more favou|rable to you than tho&s;e of the French Mini&s;ter;

but I think, you ought to feel a con&s;iderable obligation to him for having rid your coa&s;ts and towns of the &s;warthy red-cap'd <HI>citizens</HI> that in|fe&s;ted them.</P>
<P>Another injury which <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;ays you have received from Great Britain, and which renders a treaty with her <HI>di&s;honourable,</HI> is <HI>her letting the Indians and Algerines loo&s;e upon you.</HI> <Q>Great Britain, &s;ays he, urged on the Savages, by the mouth of Dorche&s;ter (it might have been <HI>Lord</HI> Dorche&s;ter in his mouth), to butcher our citizens, and de&s;olate our fron|tier; and, by <HI>her intrigues,</HI> let loo&s;e a band of Algerine robbers, barbarous <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as Bri|tons, to prey upon our commerce, <HI>and make &s;laves of free men.</HI></Q> I have more than once ob&s;erved, that having received an injury from a nation cannot, in it&s;elf, render the treating with &s;uch a nation <HI>di&s;honourable;</HI> if, therefore, the charge with re&s;pect to the Indians were well founded, it could make nothing again&s;t the pre&s;ent treaty. But, I deny that the fact has ever been proved. Governor <HI>Simcoe</HI> denies it po&s;itively, and no evidence has ever been pro|duced to &s;ub&s;tantiate it. It is, at be&s;t, then, but a matter of &s;urmi&s;e; and when <HI>Franklin</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that, <Q>In the action between <HI>General Wayne</HI> and the Indians at Fort Recovery, a number of <HI>Briti&s;h Officers and &s;oldiers</HI> were joined with the Savages and led them on to the combat, and that they were <HI>painted</HI> to con|ceal their diabolical character,</Q> he di&s;covers a character full as diabolical as that of tho&s;e

per&s;ons would have been, had his a&s;&s;ertion been true.</P>
<P>The populace of this country are ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed on by an ob&s;ervation that the French e|mi&s;&s;aries never fail to make on this &s;ubject. They tell them, and which is very true, that the Indians receive their implements of war from the Briti&s;h: but they fail to tell them, at the &s;ame time, that the&s;e implements of war are the commodities, that the Indians receive in exchange for their furs, and that, to make &s;uch an exchange a &s;ubject of complaint again&s;t the Briti&s;h, is to tell them that they &s;hall not trade with the Indians, becau&s;e you are at war with them. Con&s;idering the temper which has been but too prevalent in the&s;e States during the pre&s;ent war; con&s;idering how convenient this accu&s;ation again&s;t the Briti&s;h is to &s;ome of your military people, how many defeats it has ac|counted for; and how many more it may yet account for; con&s;idering how eagerly &s;tories of this &s;ort are fought after, and how they are exaggerated, by a &s;et of new&s;paper printers, who have rendered a free pre&s;s almo&s;t a public cur&s;e; con&s;idering all this, people ought to be ve|ry cautious how they form their belief on events at &s;uch a di&s;tance, events, concerning which im|po&s;ition is &s;o ea&s;y, and detection &s;o difficult, concerning which pa&s;&s;ion, character, and in|tere&s;t all combine to propagate deception.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the charge again&s;t Great Britain and the Algerines, it is the mo&s;t whim|pering, babyi&s;h complaint that ever di&s;graced the lips of manhood, and when a Member of
<PB N="32" REF="028437_0039_0FD9019043063B20">
the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives made mention of it, he de&s;erved to have his back&s;ide whipped. Great Britain, for her convenience, has, it &s;eems, employed her mediation, and prevailed on the Dey of Algiers to make an arrangement with the Court of Li&s;bon, which arrangement gives the Algerines an opening into the Atlan|tic, where they take your ve&s;&s;els. This is un|fortunate for you; but how is it ho&s;tile towards you, on the part of Great Britain? How is it letting the Algerines loo&s;e upon you? It is, indeed, letting them loo&s;e upon the great ocean, where they may do what they can; but to call it letting them loo&s;e on you, is mere childi&s;h|ne&s;s. One would think, to hear <HI>Franklin,</HI> that Great Britain held the Indians and Algerines in a &s;tring, like a brace of bull-dogs, ready to let loo&s;e on whom&s;oever &s;he plea&s;es. A clear proof that this is not the ca&s;e, (a proof that plea&s;es me the better, becau&s;e I am &s;ure <HI>Franklin</HI> and all his tribe will &s;ub&s;cribe to it) is, &s;he has not yet let the Algerines loo&s;e on their French bre|thren; a thing that &s;he mo&s;t certainly would have done, if &s;he could.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, Great Britain is not only to refrain from every act and deed, that may give the Algerines an opportunity of incommoding you; &s;he is not only to &s;acrifice her intere&s;t, and that of her allies, to yours; but &s;he ought to take an active part in your protection. A writer again&s;t the treaty expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q>Our negociator has <HI>omitted</HI> to make any &s;ti|pulation for <HI>the protection and &s;ecurity of the commerce of the United States</HI> to Spain, Portu|gal
<PB N="33" REF="028437_0040_0FD90196E536B008">
and the Mediterranean, again&s;t the de|predations of the Algerine and Barbary cor|&s;airs, although he knew that this forms one of the mo&s;t beneficial branches of <HI>our</HI> trade.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Aurorae</HI> of the 21&s;t July, 1795.</NOTE></Q> This writer certainly forgot, that you were <HI>in|dependent.</HI> He talks about <HI>Mr. Jay</HI>'s making this &s;tipulation, ju&s;t as if it depended upon him alone. When he was about it, he might as well have &s;tipulated for Great Britain to <HI>protect</HI> you again&s;t all the nations in the world, as &s;he u&s;ed to do formerly. And do you then &s;tand in need of Great Britain to protect you? Do you &s;tand in need of the protection of this "ruined nation?" This nation whom "no|thing will &s;ave but repentance in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes?" This "in&s;ular Ba&s;tile of &s;laves?" Do you &s;tand in need of them to protect you, "the Sovereigns of a free country?" Is it <HI>di&s;|honourable</HI> to treat with Great Britain, and yet is it <HI>honourable</HI> to accept of her protection? Prevaricating demagogues! You accu&s;e the En|voy Extraordinary of having made a humiliating treaty, while you blame him for not having made you drink off the cup of humility to the very dregs.</P>
<P>The truth is, the&s;e depredations on your com|merce by all the belligerent nations, and by the Algerines, is what ought to &s;urpri&s;e nobody; it is one of tho&s;e little rubs to which your &s;itua|tion naturally expo&s;es you: independence, for &s;ome years, at lea&s;t, is not a ro&s;e without a thorn. All that ought to &s;urprize you in con|templating

this &s;ubject, is, that France, to whom alone you give &s;helter, for who&s;e cau&s;e your good <HI>citizens</HI> have ever felt the mo&s;t un|bounded enthu&s;ia&s;m, and for who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es they have toa&s;ted them&s;elves drunk and &s;ung them&s;elves hoar&s;e a thou&s;and times, &s;hould &s;tand foremo&s;t on the li&s;t of the &s;poilers; and that, notwith&s;tanding this, your <HI>Patriots</HI> &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon a clo&s;e alliance with her, while they repro|bate the treating with Great Britain as an act at once unnece&s;&s;ary, impolitic, dangerous, and di&s;honourable.</P>
<P>Having now gone through Franklin's rea&s;ons for not treating with Great Britain, I proceed to examine his objections to the terms of the treaty it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Franklin a&s;&s;erts, that, if forming a treaty with Great Britain were con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy, the terms of the pre&s;ent treaty are di&s;advan|tageous, humiliating, and di&s;graceful to the Uni|ted States.</HI></P>
<P>This is the place to ob&s;erve, that <HI>The Let|ters of Franklin</HI> were written, <HI>before the contents of the treaty were known.</HI> He introduces his &s;ubject in the following words: <Q>The treaty <HI>is &s;aid</HI> to be arrived, and as it will be of &s;e|rious con&s;equence to us and to our po&s;te|rity, we &s;hould <HI>analize it,</HI> before it becomes the &s;upreme law of the land.</Q> That is to &s;ay, <HI>before it be known.</HI> "It will be &s;aid," continues he, <Q>to be a ha&s;ty opinion which &s;hall be advanced before the treaty it&s;elf &s;hall be before us; but when it &s;hall be pro|mulgated for our con&s;ideration, it will have
<PB N="35" REF="028437_0042_0FD901993B294380">
all the force of law about it, and it will then be too late to detect its baneful effects.</Q> Certainly no mortal ever heard rea&s;oning like this before; what a lame apology for an in|flammatory publication, intended to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the rabble again&s;t the treaty! What candour could be expected from a demagogue, who found it ju&s;t and fit to <HI>analize</HI> a thing, before he knew what it contained? Who can be &s;ur|prized to hear him a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that the We&s;tern Po&s;ts are <HI>the price</HI> of a commercial treaty, that <HI>no provi&s;ion is made for indemnity to the merchants,</HI> that <HI>the French are &s;acrificed to the Briti&s;h,</HI> that Great Britain has been <HI>meanly courted,</HI> and that <HI>all the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts</HI> of the United States are given up?</Q></P>
<P>To an&s;wer objections, made thus at random, would be taking advantage of the poor Dema|gogue; I &s;hall, therefore, lend him the aid of tho&s;e that have been made &s;ince, by the <HI>citizens</HI> of Bo&s;ton, a&s;&s;embled in Town-Meeting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What de&s;cription of per&s;ons the&s;e <HI>citizens</HI> were of and in what manner their deliberations were conducted, will be &s;een in the &s;upplement.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is not my de&s;ign to dwell upon every ob|jection that has been &s;tarted, either by <HI>Franklin</HI> or the Town-Meeting; I &s;hall content my&s;elf with an&s;wering tho&s;e only in which they di&s;co|ver an extraordinary degree of <HI>patriotic</HI> pre&s;ump|tion or di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>

an&s;wered all that their emi&s;&s;ary Franklin has &s;aid on the &s;ubject, I look upon it as unexcep|tionable.</P>
<P>Art. II. <HI>Stipulates, that the We&s;tern Po&s;ts &s;hall be evacuated in June next; that, in the mean time the United States may extend their &s;ettlements to any part within the boundary line as fixed at the peace, except within the precincts and juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts; that the &s;ettlers now within tho&s;e pre|cincts &s;hall continue to enjoy their property, and that they &s;hall be at full liberty to remain there, or re|move; that &s;uch of them as &s;hall continue to re&s;ide within the &s;aid boundary lines, &s;hall not be compell|ed to become citizens of the United States, but that, they may do &s;o if they think proper, and that, they &s;hall declare their choice in one year after the eva|cuation of the Forts, and that, all tho&s;e who do not declare their choice during that time, are to be looked upon as citizens of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>citizens</HI> of the Bo&s;ton Town-Meeting ob|ject to this article, <Q>becau&s;e it makes no provi|&s;ion to indemnify the United States for the commercial and other lo&s;&s;es, they have &s;u&s;tain|ed, and the heavy expences to which they have been &s;ubjected in con&s;equence of being kept out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for twelve years in direct violation of a treaty of peace.</Q></P>
<P>The good <HI>citizens,</HI> before they talked about <HI>indemnity,</HI> &s;hould have been certain that Great Britain was not <HI>ju&s;tifiable</HI> in her detention of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts; becau&s;e, if it &s;hould appear that &s;he was, to make a claim for indemnity would be ridiculous.</P>
<P>By the treaty of peace, Great Britain was to
<PB N="37" REF="028437_0044_0FD901A159D71CC0">
give up the&s;e Po&s;ts, and, by the &s;ame treaty, the United States were to remove certain legal impediments to the payment of Briti&s;h Debts, that is to &s;ay, debts due to Briti&s;h merchants before the war. The&s;e debts were to a heavy amount, and Great Britain had no other gua|rantee for their payment than the Po&s;ts. Your credit, at that time, was not in the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing &s;tate; and that the precaution of having a &s;ecurity was prudent, on the part of Great Britain, the event has fully proved. Nobody pretends that the impediments, above-mention|ed, are removed; nay, &s;ome of the States, and even their Members in Congre&s;s, aver that they ought not to be removed; what right have you, then, to complain of the Briti&s;h for not giving up the Po&s;ts? Was the treaty to be binding on them only? If this be the ca&s;e, your language to Great Britain re&s;embles that of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI>'s ty|rant: <Q>I make a covenant with you, entirely at your expence and to my profit, which <HI>you &s;hall</HI> ob&s;erve as long as it plea&s;es me, and which <HI>I will</HI> ob&s;erve as long as it plea&s;es my|&s;elf.</Q> This is not the way treaties are made now-a-days.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the Federal Government has done all in its power to effect the removal of the impediments, according to &s;tipulation; but to this I an&s;wer; that all in its power is not enough, if the impediments are not removed. Are they removed, or are they not? is the only que&s;tion Great Britain has to a&s;k. The States from which the debts are due (or rather a knot of intere&s;ted individuals, devoid of honour, in
<PB N="38" REF="028437_0045_0FD8BF522DF507A8">
each of them) having enacted laws, that count|eract tho&s;e made by the General Government, may be pleaded in ju&s;tification of the latter, in a dome&s;tic point of view; but every one mu&s;t perceive, that it would be childi&s;h in the ex|treme to urge it as an excu&s;e for a failure to|wards foreign nations. The very nature of a treaty implies a power in the contracting par|ties to fulfil the &s;tipulations therein contained, and, therefore, to fail from inability is the &s;ame thing as to fail from inclination, and ren|ders retaliation, at lea&s;t, ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. Upon this principle, founded on rea&s;on and the law of nations, Great Britain was certainly <HI>ju&s;|tifiable</HI> in her detention of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts. The foundation of <HI>indemnity</HI> being thus remov|ed, the &s;uper&s;tructure falls to the ground.</P>
<P>Another objection, though not to be found in the re&s;olutions of the Bo&s;ton <HI>citizens,</HI> de&s;erves notice. <Q>That the leaving Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands, &amp;c. in the precincts of the Forts, will be to e&s;tabli&s;h a Briti&s;h Colony in the territory of the Uni|ted States, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Aurora,</HI> 21&s;t July.</NOTE></Q> This is an objection that I never &s;hould have expected from the <HI>true republicans.</HI> The treaty &s;ays that the &s;et|tlers in tho&s;e precincts &s;hall have full liberty to choo&s;e between being <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of the King of Great Britain and <HI>citizens</HI> of the United States: and can the&s;e republicans doubt which they will choo&s;e?

Each indi|vidual of them will become a <Q>Prince and le|gi&s;lator</Q> by taking <HI>the oath of allegiance</HI> to the United States; is it not then, &s;acrilege, is it not to be a <HI>liberticide</HI> to imagine that they can he&s;itate in their choice? How came the&s;e enlightened <HI>citizens</HI> to commit &s;uch a blunder? How came they to &s;uppo&s;e, that the people in the precincts of the Forts were more capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between &s;ound and &s;en&s;e, be|tween the &s;hadow and the &s;ub&s;tance than they them&s;elves are. Thou&s;ands of times have you been told that the poor Canadians were terribly oppre&s;&s;ed, that they were ripe for revolt, that the militia had refu&s;ed to do their duty, and, in &s;hort, that the United States had no|thing to do but to receive them. And now, when a handful of them are likely to be left among&s;t you, you are afraid they will choo&s;e to remain &s;ubjects to the King of Great Britain!</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould all remain <HI>&s;ubjects;</HI> what will be the con&s;equence of it to you? Here are hundreds and thou&s;ands of Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubjects on the ea&s;tern parts of the States; men who never have nor ever will take the oath of allegiance to the United States, and certainly they are none the wor&s;e for it.

<P>It would be truely curious to know what mode of indemnification the&s;e <HI>citizens</HI> would have wi&s;hed for. Can there be a fairer, more honourable mode, than that fixed on by the treaty?

adopted for the &s;atisfaction of American claims, and, therefore, if you have rea&s;on to com|plain, &s;o have the Briti&s;h, and this would be &s;ingular, indeed.</P>

<P>The Bo&s;ton Town-meeting <HI>citizens</HI> &s;ay no|thing about this article.

<P>Art.

<P>It is well known (and will be well remem|bered too) that, before <HI>Mr. Jay's</HI> departure for England, a re&s;olution was entered into by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the motion of <HI>Mr. Dayton,</HI> to &s;eque&s;ter all debts and funds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> property of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects: The article before us guards again&s;t this, and as there was not an hone&s;t man in the Uni|on on (a majority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives excepted), who did not execrate <HI>Mr. Dayton's</HI> plundering motion, as it was called, &s;o, I be|lieve there is not one of that de&s;cription, who does not mo&s;t cordially approve of the article which will, for the future, render &s;uch moti|ons abortive.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the King of Great Britain would never come to any arrange|ment, without a provi&s;ion of this kind. It would have been much better for his &s;ubjects to break off all communication with you at once, than to have not only their profits but their capitals depending on the arbitrary will of your government. Where would be the &s;ecurity of merchants trading to this country, if the debts due them might at any time be &s;eized to pay for damages, received by Americans from &s;omebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>Credit is with nations as with individuals; while unimpaired it is almo&s;t unbounded, it can perform any thing; but one &s;ingle retrograde &s;tep, and it is bla&s;ted, it is nothing.
<PB N="47" REF="028437_0054_0FD901BDFB0D08F0">
Your credit has &s;uffered much from the mo|tion of <HI>Mr. Dayton,</HI> and had the &s;eque&s;tra|tion become a law, or had the mercantile world been left in doubt concerning what might happen in future, one half of the great capitals that now give wings to your commerce. would have found their way to other countries, Riches &s;eek &s;ecurity, as rivers &s;eek the &s;ea.</P>
<P>It is pretended by the Town-meeting, that a power to confi&s;cate might contribute <HI>to the peace of the country.</HI> This was certainly a very curious rea&s;on on which to found an objection to the article, and not le&s;s &s;o, as coming from a faction, who have con&s;tantly cen&s;ured the Pre&s;ident <HI>for not joining France in the pre&s;ent war.</HI> But, in place of contributing to the peace of the country, would it not be an eternal &s;ource of war? and is not this the true rea|&s;on why all <HI>the old committemen, privateer&s;men,</HI> and <HI>confi&s;cators</HI> are loath to abandon it? I think &s;o. It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Con|gre&s;s will, for &s;ome years, con&s;i&s;t, partly, of men who would prefer the glutting of their impotent revenge to the good of their country; and of others who, while your connexions with France continue, will, for &s;olid rea&s;ons too evi|dent to need a mention, prefer her intere&s;ts to yours. The&s;e men will ever &s;eek a quar|rel with Great Britain. With re&s;pect to war, however, they will be cautious, as far as open profe&s;&s;ions go. The people have not yet for|got what war is. But, armed with confi&s;cating powers, they would brandi&s;h them at every turn; and plunder is a thing that plea&s;es the
<PB N="48" REF="028437_0055_0FD901BF78D8E6F8">
populace &s;o much better than fighting, it is &s;o much ea&s;ier to beat in the door of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, than to beat a Briti&s;h fleet or army, there is very little fear of their confi&s;cating mea&s;ures being ap|proved of by the majority <HI>in number.</HI> But, would all end here? Would the Briti&s;h look tamely on? I am of opinion they would not. If the object of Great Britain, in offending you, &s;hould be to provoke a war, &s;he would di&s;regard five or &s;ix millions of dollars; &s;hould it not be war, an act of &s;eque&s;tration or confi&s;cation would certainly produce a war. Thus, in both ca&s;es, you would have war, and with this di&s;|advantage, that you would give your enemy a a fair pretext; from being the injured party, you would become the aggre&s;&s;ors, unite every heart and hand again&s;t you in Great Britain, and excite the mi&s;tru&s;t and contempt of other nations.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that you have no other means of de|fending <Q>the rights and property of your ci|tizens,</Q> is beyond expre&s;&s;ion degrading; but the Town-meeting are not &s;ingular in this opinion. A writer in the <HI>Aurora</HI> of Philadel|phia, ob&s;erves, that <Q>confi&s;cation may be re|garded as <HI>the American weapon of defence,</HI> and that to abandon it, is an outrage on <HI>humanity, policy, ju&s;tice, and natural right.</HI></Q> What! a nation of &s;overeigns no weapon of defence but that of a &s;windler! Tell us no more, then, that you are a <HI>great</HI> people; give up all preten&s;ion to a place among the nations of the earth, for none of them have ever avow|ed &s;o vile, and pu&s;illanimous a principle.

<P>One thing, above all, ought to be con&s;i|dered on this &s;ubject: that an act of &s;eque&s;tra|tion or confi&s;cation mu&s;t ever fail in its operation, or e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t con&s;ummate tyranny.

<P>This is all very well for the&s;e Citizen-&s;overeigns, and Sovereign-citizens; but for you who, I hope, have no preten&s;ion to this kind of civic royalty, it becomes you to talk and think like rea&s;onable creatures.</P>

It is a fact <HI>well a&s;certained,</HI> that the We&s;t India I&s;lands are <HI>in a &s;tate of depen|dence among us,</HI> and by means of this dependence, <HI>we are enabled to make</HI> &s;uch regulations with re&s;pect to our commerce, as &s;hall render a treaty with Great Britain wholly &s;uperfluous. <HI>It is equally a&s;certained,</HI> that in our commerce with Great Britain her&s;elf, the balance of trade is con&s;iderably in her favour, and from this circum&s;tance likewi&s;e &s;he would be induced to <HI>reciprocate</HI> intere&s;ts, without a commercial treaty, were <HI>tho&s;e means pur&s;ued which are in our pow|er.</HI></Q> Now, to know the real value of the term <HI>reciprocity,</HI> take the following &s;entences. <Q><HI>If we cede an advantage for an advantage ceded to us, whence the boa&s;t of a treaty?</HI> She (Great Britain) can grant us no commercial

<P>If what the <HI>Patriots</HI> &s;ay be true, then, you have it in your power to <HI>exact</HI> from Great Britain what conditions you plea&s;e; 1&s;t. be|cau&s;e your articles of exportation are, in great part, nece&s;&s;aries of life; 2d. becau&s;e the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies are in a &s;tate of dependence on you; 3d. becau&s;e the balance of trade with Great Britain is greatly in her favour.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Beau&s;e your articles of exportation are in great part, nece&s;&s;aries of life.</HI> This idea is ori|ginally of the populace, who look upon every barrel of provi&s;ion &s;hipped off to the We&s;t In|dies, or el&s;e where, as &s;o much lo&s;s to them|&s;elves, and as a kind of alms to keep the poor fo|reign devils from &s;tarving: and, in return for this genero&s;ity on their part, they imagine they have the power to <HI>compel</HI> the beggars to do ju&s;t what they plea&s;e. From the populace it found its way into Congre&s;s, under the au&s;pi|ces of a member of that body who made it the ground work of his famous re&s;olutions, intended to <HI>force</HI> Great Britain to yield you commer|cial advantages. No wonder, then, that it &s;hould now be taken up by <HI>Franklin,</HI> and all the oppo&s;ers of the treaty. They cannot con|ceive how a nation, to whom you throw a mor|&s;el of bread when you plea&s;e, &s;hould dare re|fu&s;e you any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="028437_0062_0FD901D838FD1898">That your exports being, in great part, ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life (that is <HI>eatables</HI>) ought to give you a preference in commercial relations, is an error, and not the le&s;s &s;o for being a popular one. Commodities being eatabes may give the &s;el|ler a preference in a town during the time of a &s;eige, but not in the great world of com|merce. It is as nece&s;&s;ary for you to &s;ell your produce as for a toy-man to &s;ell his toys. If they rot in your &s;tores their being nece&s;&s;aries of life will not dimini&s;h the lo&s;s. If the land is obliged to lie fallow, the mill &s;tand &s;till, and the ve&s;&s;els rot at the wharfs, little &s;atisfaction will it be to the farmer, the miller and the merchant, that they all u&s;ed to be employed in cultivating and di&s;tributing the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life. When a man is reduced to begga|ry for want of a vent for his goods, it &s;ignifies not a farthing to him, whether the&s;e goods were nece&s;&s;aries of life, or luxuries. No; it is the pecuniary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ari&s;ing from trading with a nation, which ought to give, or which can give, that nation a right, or a power, to <HI>exact</HI> com|mercial advantages; and not the nature of the merchandize &s;he has to export.</P>

and &s;uch as you could not po&s;&s;ibly do without. I cannot pretend to &s;ay what proportion your imports from the I&s;lands bear to your exports to them; but there mu&s;t be a balance of trade either for or again&s;t you. If the balance be again&s;t you, you receive more of the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life from the I&s;lands, than you carry to them, and they cannot, then, be in a &s;tate of dependence, on that account: if the balance be in your favour, then the trade is an advan|tageous one for you, and, if it makes a depen|dence on either &s;ide, it makes you dependent on the I&s;lands. Ob&s;erve here, that the <HI>Patriots</HI> &s;uppo&s;e you have the power of <HI>compelling</HI> Great Britain to do what you plea&s;e, becau&s;e, in her trade with you, <HI>the balance is greatly in her favour,</HI> and becau&s;e, in your trade with the We&s;t Indies, <HI>the balance is in your favour.</HI> Thus the We&s;t India I&s;lands are in a &s;tate of de|pendence on you, becau&s;e you gain by them; and Great Britain is in the &s;ame &s;tate becau&s;e &s;he gains by you!

<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e, with the <HI>Patriots,</HI> that the manufactures you receive from Great Britain are not nece&s;&s;ary to you.

This is allowing my adver&s;aries every thing they can a&s;k, and all I a&s;k of them in return, is, to allow me, that Great Britain &s;tands in no need of <HI>your manufactures.</HI> If they do not re|fu&s;e me this, as, I think, they cannot, I have not the lea&s;t doubt but I &s;hall prove, that cutting off all communication between the countries, would injure you more than Great Britain.</P>
<P>The imports being prohibited on each &s;ide, and both being able to do without them, the injury mu&s;t ari&s;e from the &s;toppage being put to the exports; and as Great Britain &s;ells you much more than you &s;ell her, the <HI>Patriots</HI> maintain, that this &s;toppage would do her more harm than it would you.

<P>How illu&s;ive this is we &s;hall &s;ee in a minute. It is a maxim in commerce, that the exports of a nation are the &s;ource of her riches, and that, in proportion as you take from that &s;ource, &s;he is injured and enfeebled; hence it follows, that cutting off the communica|tion between Great Britain and you would in|jure her more than you, in proportion to the balance now in her favour; that is to &s;ay, <HI>if the total of her exports and the total of your ex|ports were to the &s;ame amount.</HI> But this is far from being the ca&s;e: your exports amount to no more than 20 millions of dollars, or there|abouts, 9 millions of which go to Great Bri|tain and her dominions, while the exports of Great Britain amount to 100 millions of dol|lars, no more than 15 millions of which come to the United States. Suppo&s;e, then, all communication cut off at once; you would lo&s;e 9 twentieths of your exports, while Great Bri|tain would lo&s;e only 15 hundredths of hers: &s;o that, if there be any truth in arithmetic, you would injure your&s;elves three times as much as you would her.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations will, of cour&s;e, have no weight with the hone&s;t &s;tipendiaries of France; but with tho&s;e who&s;e only de&s;ire, is to injure Great Britain <HI>more</HI> than the United States, they ought to have &s;ome weight.</P>

<P>This article has been the innocent cau&s;e of much alarm.

<P>From the de&s;cription of the per&s;ons who have hitherto oppo&s;ed the treaty, and from the futillity of the rea&s;ons they have given for their oppo&s;ition, there is every rea&s;on to imagine, that great part of them object (in the bottom of their hearts) to this article only. If this be the ca&s;e, it is pity the article was introduced.

<P><HI>Franklin</HI> has not obliged the world with ar|ticles of impeachment regularly drawn up; but, as far as can be gathered from his letters, he would have the Chief Magi&s;trate of the Union impeached; 1&s;t. for having appointed <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> as Envoy extraordinary; 2d. for having appointed an Envoy extraordinary, on this occa&s;ion, contrary to the opinion of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives and of the Democratic Society; 3d. for his re&s;erve towards the Senate, previous to <HI>Mr. Jay's</HI> departure; 4th. for his re&s;erve towards the people; and, 5th. for having evaded a new treaty with France, while he courted one with Great Britain.</P>

The appointment of the Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States as Envoy extraordinary, to the court of Great Britain, put to defiance the compact under which we have a&s;&s;ociated, and made the will of the Ex|ecutive paramount to the general will of the people. The principle laid down by this ap|pointment, &s;trikes at the root of our civil &s;ecurity; nay, it aims a deadly blow at liberty it&s;elf.</Q> The word <HI>uncon&s;titutional</HI> is, with the oppo&s;ers of the government, a word of va&s;t import: it means any thing they plea&s;e to have it mean. In their acceptation of the word, therefore, I cannot pretend to &s;ay that the conduct of the Pre&s;ident, in appointing <HI>Mr. Jay,</HI> was not <HI>uncon&s;titutional;</HI> but if <HI>un|con&s;titutional</HI> be allowed to mean, <HI>&s;omething con|trary to the Con&s;titution,</HI> I think it would be ve|ry difficult to prove, that the appointment was <HI>uncon&s;titutional;</HI> for, certain it is, there is no article in the Con&s;titution, that forbids, either litterally or by implication, the employing of a Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States on an extraor|dinary emba&s;&s;y. "The Con&s;titution," &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> <Q>has provided, that the different departments of government &s;hould be kept di&s;|tinct,
<PB N="65" REF="028437_0072_0FD901F0E1564958">
and, con&s;equently, to unite them is a violation of it, and an encroachment on the liberties of the people, guaranteed by that in&s;trument.&mdash;The appointment of <HI>John Jay,</HI> Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States, as Envoy Extraordinary to the court of Great Britain, is contrary to the &s;pirit and meaning of the Con&s;titution; as it unites in the &s;ame per&s;on judicial and legi&s;lative functions.</Q> If as it is here a&s;&s;erted, the Pre&s;ident had united the judicial with the legi&s;lative functions, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that he would have depart|ed from the &s;pirit and meaning of the Con&s;ti|tution; but, has the mere negociation of a treaty any thing to do with the legi&s;lative functions? It appears to me not. Treaties are the &s;upreme law of the land, and, therefore, the &s;anctioning of them, the making of them laws, is a legi&s;lative act; but the mere draw|ing of them up, the preparing of them for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the legi&s;lature, is no legi&s;la|tive act at all.</P>
<P>If negociating be a legi&s;lative act, it naturally follows, that nobody but the legi&s;lature, or &s;ome member or members of it, could be em|ployed in a negociation; and the Con&s;titution expre&s;sly provides, that, <Q>no member of Congre&s;s &s;hall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office, under the authority of the United States which &s;hall have been created during &s;uch time.</Q> Thus then if the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the Con&s;ti|tution makes negociating a legi&s;lative act,
<PB N="66" REF="028437_0073_0FD901F1B2AAD340">
and, con&s;equently, requires a legi&s;lator to nego|ciate a treaty, and the <HI>latter</HI> po&s;itively forbids it, the whole clau&s;e re&s;pecting treaties is &s;u|perfluous, for there ought never to be any &s;uch thing as treaties.</P>
<P>When the &s;ecretary of either department brings forward a plan for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, does he act in a legi&s;lative capacity? And what more is an unratified treaty? In &s;hort, if a negociator acts in a legi&s;lative capacity, &s;o does every petitioner; nay, every clerk and printer, employed by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chief Ju&s;tice is further objected to as an Envoy Extraordinary; on this occa&s;ion, be|cau&s;e, <Q>treaties being the &s;upreme law of the land, it becomes the duty of the judiciary to expound and apply them, and, therefore, to permit an officer in that department to &s;hare in their formation, is to unite di&s;tinct functi|ons, tends to level the barriers of our free|dom, and to e&s;tabli&s;h precedents pregnant with danger.</Q> If the mere formations of laws by gentlemen of the bar tends to level the barriers of your freedom, I am afraid the barriers of your freedom are already levelled; for I believe, there are very few laws that do not pa&s;s through their hands, or concerning which their advice is not a&s;ked, before they are &s;anctioned. <HI>Franklin</HI> (perhaps through ig|norance) confounds the <HI>formation</HI> with the <HI>mak|ing</HI> of a law; how e&s;&s;entially they differ I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>To object to the Chief Ju&s;tice as a negociator, becau&s;e it would become his duty to expound

and apply the treaty he was to negociate, is what I &s;hould expect from nobody but <HI>Frank|lin</HI> or &s;ome one of his faction.

Or was he, on that ac|count, ever &s;uppo&s;ed to be le&s;s de&s;irous of &s;ee|ing it duly and faithfully executed? Pur&s;ue this mon&s;trous maxim, and &s;ee where it will end. If it be un&s;afe to tru&s;t the expounding and ap|plying of a law to him who has a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fra|ming it, mu&s;t it not be much more un&s;afe to tru&s;t the expounding and application of it to tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making it? And, is it not, then, un&s;afe to admit gentlemen of the law in|to Congre&s;s, without incapaciating them from pleading at the bar, or, at lea&s;t, from becoming judges, for ever after? Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that one of the pre&s;ent Senators were to be ap|pointed Chief Ju&s;tice in the room of <HI>Mr. Jay,</HI> would he not have to expound and apply the treaty which he has ju&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making? And &s;hould &s;ome of the gentlemen of the other hou&s;e be, at a future period, appointed judges of the &s;upreme court, would they not have to ap|ply the laws, which, as legi&s;lators, they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making? Should a commander in chief propo&s;e to Congre&s;s a plan for the regula|tion of the troops, and &s;hould it become a law, would it be &s;aid, that the General had united the legi&s;lative with the military functions, and that he ought to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice, as unfit to expound and apply the law which he
<PB N="68" REF="028437_0075_0FD901F7EF435998">
had propo&s;ed. The principle of <HI>Franklin,</HI> if a|dopted, would render it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for the Congre&s;s to avail them&s;elves of the ta|lents or integrity of any one out of their own body.</P>
<P>But, at any rate, had this objection been well founded; had there been cau&s;e to fear the con&s;equences of leaving the treaty to be ex|pounded and applied by him who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in framing it, the danger is now over: <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> is no more Chief Ju&s;tice; the <HI>freemen</HI> of the State of New York knew how to e&s;timate his merit rather better than <HI>Franklin.</HI> Fortune &s;eems to have lent a hand in depriving the ene|mies of the government of all grounds of com|plaint, and yet they make a &s;hift to keep the Union in an uproar.</P>
<P>Another objection to &s;ending the Chief Ju&s;|tice on this mi&s;&s;ion, is, that <HI>a Pre&s;ident</HI> might thereby e&s;cape from the hands of ju&s;tice, or, at lea&s;t, elude a trial. "From the nature," &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> <Q>and terms of an impeachment a|gain&s;t a Pre&s;ident of the United States, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that the Chief Ju&s;tice of the United States &s;hould pre&s;ide in the Se|nate, but that he &s;hould be above the bias which the honour and emolument in the gift of the Executive might create.</Q> 'Tis true, the con&s;titution &s;ays, that, <Q>when the Pre&s;i|dent of the United States is tried, the Chief Ju&s;tice &s;hall pre&s;ide.</Q> But, waving the in|&s;olence and mo&s;t <HI>patriotic</HI> ingratitude of this in|&s;inuation; admitting your Pre&s;ident to be what <HI>Franklin</HI> would make you believe he is,
<PB N="69" REF="028437_0076_0FD901FB741D27F0">
and that the nece&s;&s;ity of impeaching him was a thing to be expected, I cannot perceive any great inconvenience that could ari&s;e from the ab&s;ence of the Chief Ju&s;tice. The Pre&s;ident could not be impeached before the opening of Congre&s;s, and, by that time, it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the object of the extraordinary mi&s;&s;ion would be accompli&s;hed, and the Envoy ready to return. An impeachment again&s;t the Pre&s;ident could hardly be hurried on in &s;uch a manner as not to leave an interval of four months between his accu&s;ation and trial, a &s;pace quite &s;ufficient for recalling the Chief Ju&s;|tice. And as to the bias, that the honour and emolument attached to the office of Envoy might create in favour of the culprit Pre&s;ident, that could not be very powerful, becau&s;e, the of|fice of Envoy mu&s;t cea&s;e, before the Chief Ju&s;|tice could enter on his functions as Judge on the Pre&s;ident; and <HI>Franklin</HI> ought to know by his own heart, that <HI>gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervices</HI> would have but very little weight in favour of the offender.</P>
<P>There is one objection remaining, which, if well founded, is really of a &s;erious nature. <HI>Franklin</HI> po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that the appoint|ment of the Envoy Extraordinary was &s;trongly prote&s;ted again&s;t by a very <HI>re&s;pectable minority</HI> of the Senate; and not by them alone, but by the <HI>Democratic Society of Penn&s;ylvania</HI> al&s;o! That this re&s;pectable minority &s;hould coin|cide in &s;entiment with the Penn&s;ylvania democratic &s;ociety is, indeed, a circum|&s;tance that de&s;erves to be well attended to;
<PB N="70" REF="028437_0077_0FD901FCF8824B18">
and, no doubt, it has had, and will yet have, due weight with the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>How it came into the head of <HI>Franklin</HI> to introduce his club on this occa&s;ion, it is not ea&s;y to imagine. He does not pretend, I hope, that there is &s;omething uncon&s;titutional here al&s;o? The Con&s;titution &s;ays, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall take the advice of the Senate, but it is to|tally &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the democratic &s;oci|ety of Penn&s;ylvania. Mightily "alarming," indeed, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould not con&s;ult this club of butchers, tinkers, broken huk|&s;ters, and tran&s;atlantic traitors! Had he want|ed a fellow to fell an ox or mend a kettle, to bilk his creditors or blow up an in&s;urrection, he would have done well to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the democratic &s;ociety of Penn&s;ylvania for ad|vice; but to a&s;k their advice in the appoint|ment of an Envoy Extraordinary would have been as prepo&s;terous as con&s;ulting the devil in the choice of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I have now an&s;wered, and I hope to your &s;atisfaction, what <HI>Franklin</HI> calls his <HI>con&s;tituti|onal objections</HI> to the appointment of <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> as Envoy Extraordinary: it remains for me to take notice of one of a more per&s;onal nature.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin,</HI> con&s;cious that <HI>Mr. Jay's</HI> charac|ter for wi&s;dom and integrity was unimpeacha|ble, has conjured up again&s;t him an opinion, which he gave &s;ome time ago, concerning the We&s;tern Po&s;ts. He &s;ays: <Q>After the decla|ration made by <HI>John Jay</HI> that Great Britain was ju&s;tifiable in her detention of the We&s;t|ern Po&s;ts, it was a &s;acrifice of the intere&s;ts
<PB N="71" REF="028437_0078_0FD90201B280E4E0">
and peace of the United States to commit a negociation to him, in which the evacuati|on of tho&s;e po&s;ts ought to form an e&s;&s;ential part." This unqualified declaration, "that Great Britain was ju&s;tifiable in her detention of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts,</Q> is a mo&s;t &s;hameful mi&s;|repre&s;entation of <HI>Mr. Jay's</HI> opinion on the &s;ubject. By this declaration <HI>Franklin</HI> in&s;i|nuates, that <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> had given it as his opi|nion that Great Britain would be ju&s;tifiable in her detention of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts for ever; whereas his opinion was, that &s;he was ju&s;tifi|able in detaining tho&s;e po&s;ts, only 'till the &s;ti|pulation of the treaty of peace with re&s;pect to debts, due to Briti&s;h Subjects from &s;ome of the States, &s;hould be fulfilled. And was there a candid, hone&s;t man in the United States who differed in opinion from <HI>Mr. Jay,</HI> on this &s;ubject? Very few I believe, except it were through ignorance. I am fully convinced, that there is not, at this time, a &s;ingle well in|formed man in this country, who is not &s;atisfied, that Great Britain was ju&s;tifiable in her deten|tion of the Po&s;ts; to object then, to <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> as an Envoy Extraordinary, becau&s;e he had given his opinion to that effect, was to object to him for having &s;poken the truth, like an independent hone&s;t man: indeed, the <HI>Patriots</HI> &s;eem to look on hone&s;ty as a na|tural di&s;qualification, and, therefore, their ob|jection to <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> is not &s;o unaccountable as it otherwi&s;e would be.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t not tho&s;e people, who &s;o boldly a&s;&s;ur|ed you, that <HI>John Jay</HI> would betray your in|tere&s;ts,
<PB N="72" REF="028437_0079_0FD9020349072C28">
that he would &s;ell the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, &amp;c. have blu&s;hed when they &s;aw that a &s;urrender of the&s;e Po&s;ts was the fir&s;t thing he had &s;tipula|ted for? No; a <HI>Patriot's</HI> &s;kin is like the &s;hield of the Grecian hero; blood cannot penetrate through "ten bull hides."</P>
<P>The following anecdote will at once prove the inju&s;tice of charging <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> with a wi&s;h to abandon the We&s;tern Po&s;ts to the Bri|ti&s;h, and confirm the Prudence of the Pre&s;ident's choice.</P>
<P>"From here," &s;ays Mr. Bri&s;&s;ot, <Q>we went to New Rochelle. This place will always be celebrated for having given birth to one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed men of the Ameri|can Revolution; a republican remarkable for his firmne&s;s and his coolne&s;s, a writer eminent for his nervous &s;tyle, and his clo&s;e logic, <HI>Mr. Jay.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>At the time of laying the foundation of the Peace of 1783, <HI>Mr. de Vergennes,</HI> actu|ated by &s;ecret motives, wi&s;hed to engage the emba&s;&s;adors of Congre&s;s to confine their demands to the fi&s;heries, and to renounce the <HI>We&s;tern Territory.</HI> The mini&s;ter required particularly, that the independence of Ame|rica &s;hould not be con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of the peace; but, &s;imply, that it &s;hould be con|ditional. To &s;ucceed in this project, it was nece&s;&s;ary to gain over <HI>Jay</HI> and <HI>Adams. Mr. Jay</HI> declared to <HI>Mr. de Vergennes,</HI> that he would &s;ooner lo&s;e his life than &s;ign &s;uch a treaty; that the Americans fought for Independence; that they would never lay
<PB N="73" REF="028437_0080_0FD90204A66C22C8">
down their arms 'till it &s;hould be fully con|&s;ecrated; that the court of France had re|cognized it, and that there would be a con|tradiction in her conduct, if &s;he deviated from that point. It was not difficult for <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> to bring <HI>Mr. Adams</HI> to his determina|tion; and <HI>Mr. de Vergennes</HI> could never &s;hake his firmne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Mr. Jay</HI> was equally immoveable by all the efforts of the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, whom <HI>Mr. de Vergennes</HI> had gained to his party. <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> proved to him, that it was the in|tere&s;t of the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, that the Americans &s;hould be independent, and not in a &s;ituation which would render them de|pendent on their ally. He converted him to his &s;entiment; for his rea&s;oning determined the court of St. James's. When <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through England in his return to America, <HI>Lord Shelburne</HI> de&s;ired to &s;ee him. Accu&s;ed by the nation of having granted too much to the Americans, he de&s;ired to know, in ca&s;e he had per&s;i&s;ted not to accord to the Americans the <HI>We&s;tern Territory,</HI> if they would have continued the war&mdash;<HI>Mr. Jay</HI> an&s;wered that he believed they would, and that <HI>he &s;hould have advi&s;ed it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the man whom the <HI>Patriots</HI> accu&s;e of intentions of rendering the United States dependent on Great Britain, and of abandon|ing the We&s;tern Po&s;ts! This is the man, who, after twenty years &s;pent in the &s;ervice of his country, after having a &s;econd time en&s;ured

its happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, is called <Q>a &s;lave, a coward, a traitor,</Q> and is burnt in effigy for having <Q>bartered its liberty for Briti&s;h gold!</Q> The ingratitude of republics and republicans has long been proverbial.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Franklin</HI> would have the Pre&s;ident im|peached, <HI>for having appointed an Envoy Extra|ordinary to Great Britain contrary to the opinion of the majority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</HI> <Q>A majority of that Hou&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> were in favour of dignified and energetic mea&s;ures; they &s;purned the idea of a pati|ent and ignominious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to robbery and outrage. The different propo&s;itions of of Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Madi&s;on, Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Dayton</HI> &s;ub&s;tantiate this a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;And yet the Executive nominated an Envoy Extraordi|nary in coincidence with the minority, ap|parently to defeat the intentions of <HI>the repre&s;entatives of the people.</HI> This fact is &s;erious and alarming.</Q> That the Pre&s;ident did nominate, and, by and with the advice of the Senate, appoint, the Envoy Extraordi|nary, contrary to the opinion of the majori|ty of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, is, at lea&s;t, doubtful, becau&s;e no &s;uch que&s;tion could be agitated in that hou&s;e; but that he would have been ju&s;tifiable in &s;o doing is not doubtful at all. Your Con&s;titution, which this Dema|gogue affects to call the palladium of your liberty, &s;ays that the Pre&s;ident, with the Se|nate, &s;hall appoint Emba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c. and not a word about the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="028437_0082_0FD9020A6254B240">Without directly denying the authority of the Pre&s;ident and Senate in the appointment of an Envoy Extraordinary, <HI>Franklin</HI> a&s;&s;erts that the exerci&s;e of that authority was in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance, interfering with the dignified and energetic mea&s;ures that were pending in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. If the con&s;titution had made an exception here, if it had provided that the Pre&s;ident and Senate &s;hould not ap|point an Envoy, but that their functions &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, while dignified and ener|getic mea&s;ures, were pending in the other Hou&s;e, I &s;hould be ready to confe&s;s, that the former had &s;tepped beyond their authority; but, as the Con&s;titution is &s;ilent on this &s;ubject, I cannot. It was po&s;&s;ible, indeed, for the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to fall into an indelicate inte|ference with the Executive, on this occa&s;ion, and, perhaps, they did &s;o; but the Executive could not intefere with them, unle&s;s they had fir&s;t begun to meddle with a branch of authori|ty, which the Con&s;titution had forbidden them to touch. What would be &s;aid of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, were they to frame a money bill, pa&s;s it, and &s;end it to the other Hou&s;e? Ju&s;t as con&s;onant to the Con&s;titution is it for that Hou&s;e to intefere in the nomi|nation, or appointment, of an Envoy to a fo|reign court.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as to the fact, how did the appoint|ment of the Envoy interfere with the <HI>dignified and energetic mea&s;ures?</HI> They were adopted by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and pre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="76" REF="028437_0083_0FD9020B391FF278">
to the Senate, who rejected them, and who would have rejected them, whether the Envoy had been previou&s;ly appointed or not. This is evident, becau&s;e had they intended to &s;anction the <HI>dignified and energetic mea&s;ures,</HI> they would not have appointed the Envoy; and therefore, by delaying the appointment, 'till the&s;e mea|&s;ures were rejected by the Senate, nothing could have been gained but a lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> &s;eems to triumph in proving, that the Pre&s;ident acted contrary to the opinion of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. I have already ob&s;erved that that Hou&s;e had nothing to do in the appointment in que&s;tion; but, even &s;uppo&s;e they had, is the Senate nothing? What is the u&s;e of three branches in the Con&s;titution, if two of them mu&s;t ever yield to the will of the third, or to the whim of a faction? To what end has a power been given to the Senate to reject bills &s;ent to them by the other Hou&s;e, if they are never to exerci&s;e it, unle&s;s it &s;hould &s;hould happen to be agreeable to the democratic clubs? In &s;hort, why is there a Se|nate and Pre&s;ident at all? And, indeed, it &s;eems to be the opinion of your countryman <HI>Franklin,</HI> that the&s;e two branches, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> are u&s;ele&s;s. <Q>If, &s;ays he, the <HI>immediate</HI> Repre|&s;entatives of the people were to decide upon treaties, the &s;ecrecy in relation to them would be more tolerable.</Q> After this &s;entence, it is perfectly ridiculous to hear him cen&s;ure the Ad|mini&s;tration for acting <HI>uncon&s;titutionally;</HI> full as much &s;o, as it is to hear my old friend <HI>Prie&s;tley</HI> rebuking <HI>Tom Paine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="028437_0084_0FD9020EF3145EC8">If the <HI>immediate</HI> Repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple, as <HI>Franklin</HI> is plea&s;ed to call them, were permitted to decide upon treaties, there is no one act of authority that they would not &s;oon exerci&s;e exclu&s;ively. Very &s;oon would the whole power of the &s;tate be con&s;ecrated in one heterogeneous a&s;&s;embly, &s;plit up into committees of confi&s;cation, war, and murder.

You may thank God that your Con&s;titution has provided a|gain&s;t a legi&s;lative &s;courge like this. It is this prudent provi&s;ion alone that has &s;aved you from the dreadful con&s;equences, which the dignified and energetic mea&s;ures of the <HI>patri|otic</HI> triumvirate, <HI>Madi&s;on, Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Dayton,</HI> would mo&s;t inevitably have produced.</P>
<P>After having cen&s;ured the Pre&s;ident for not acting in coincidence with the &s;entiment of the <HI>majority</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, <HI>Franklin</HI> returns to the charge by cen&s;uring him for acting in coincidence with the &s;entiment of the <HI>minority</HI> of the &s;ame Hou&s;e; this he calls, "a &s;erious and an alarming fact," ju&s;t as if it was not an unavoidable con&s;equence of the other. But, it is not a little extraordinary to hear him cen&s;ure the Pre&s;ident for acting in coincidence with the <HI>minority</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, when, a few pages before,
<PB N="78" REF="028437_0085_0FD90213AEB8A1E0">
he cen&s;ures him for <HI>not</HI> acting in coincidence with the &s;entiment of the <HI>re&s;pectable minority</HI> of the Senate? Perhaps the epithet <HI>re&s;pectable,</HI> which <HI>Franklin</HI> has be&s;towed on his <HI>minority</HI> of the Senate (and of which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>re&s;pectable Mr. Ma&s;on</HI> was one), render them &s;uperior to the majority, and, if &s;o, their opi|nion certainly ought to have been followed. But, the truth is, I believe, this <HI>re&s;pectable minority</HI> of the Senate were in favour of tho&s;e dignified and energetic, or dragooning, plundering, mea|&s;ures, which the Pre&s;ident did not approve of, and &s;o were the majority of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives; and this is the rea&s;on why <HI>Frank|lin,</HI> who is a &s;ort of war trumpet, would have had him guided by the minority of one Hou&s;e and by the majority of the other.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident's having acted in coincidence with the minority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives ought to be looked upon as a mere matter of accident; for, on the appointment of an Envoy, it was not nece&s;&s;ary for him to take cognizance of what was pa&s;&s;ing among&s;t them; but, as to his acting in coinci|dence with the majority of the Senate, it was a duty that the Con&s;titution im|po&s;ed on him. According to the wi&s;h of <HI>Franklin,</HI> the Pre&s;ident &s;hould have rejected the advice of that branch of the legi&s;lature which the Con&s;titution has a&s;&s;ociated with him in the appointment of an Envoy, to adhere to the advice of another branch, to which the Con&s;titution has allotted no participation in

&s;uch appointments. This is what the <HI>Patriots</HI> would have called acting <HI>con&s;titutionally.</HI></P>
<P>Not content with accu&s;ing the Pre&s;ident of acting uncon&s;titutionally in nominating an Envoy to Great Britain, <HI>Franklin</HI> adds, that he did it <Q>apparently to defeat the inten|tions of the Repre&s;entatives of the people.</Q> There is a good deal of bitterne&s;s in this. If, by the <HI>Repre&s;entatives of the people, Franklin</HI> means the majority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives alone, I a&s;&s;ent to the truth of his remark: nay, I will go further, and own, that I am ful|ly per&s;uaded, the Pre&s;ident did appoint the Envoy Extraordinary on purpo&s;e to defeat their intentions. But, were I an American, very far &s;hould I be from imputing this to him as a crime; for, had he not defeated their inten|tions, you would by this time have been ob|jects of pity rather than of envy.</P>
<P>There was no per&s;on of the lea&s;t di&s;cern|ment who was not well a&s;&s;ured that the object of your <HI>patriotic</HI> Members of Congre&s;s, was to reduce you to the nece&s;&s;ity of making a com|mon cau&s;e with the French.

With this de&s;irable object in view one propo&s;ed laying &s;uch duties on Briti&s;h merchandi&s;e and &s;hips, as would go nearly to a prohibition; a|nother propo&s;ed an entire prohibition; and a third, in order to pre&s;erve peace with Great Britain, propo&s;ed &s;eizing all debts and funds, the property of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects!

<P>I am totally at a lo&s;s to account for the&s;e gentlemen's motives in endeavouring to plunge this country into a war with Great Britain.

The term <HI>advice</HI> has a natural and obvious reference to negociation; <HI>that no negociation &s;hall be en|tered into but with the advice of the Senate.</HI></Q> Before I take the liberty of contradicting our Demagogue here, give me leave to make him contradict him&s;elf. "The Pre&s;ident," &s;ays he, in another place, <Q>has power by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate to <HI>con|clude</HI> treaties; that is, the Senate has the power to accept or reject any treaty negociated by the Pre&s;ident; <HI>but this power has not gone to prevent him from opening a ne|gociation with any nation he thought proper.</HI></Q> This <HI>Patriot</HI> was determined no one &s;hould tri|umph in confuting it. A di&s;putant that thus contradicts him&s;elf point blank, without any kind of ceremony or apology, &s;ets his adver|&s;ary at defiance.</P>
<P>Re&s;erving my&s;elf 'till by and by to account for the&s;e contradictory expo&s;itions of the &s;ame text, I am ready to allow, that the latter of them exactly meets my &s;entiments; that is, that the &s;hare of power, in making trea|ties, allotted to the Senate, <HI>does not go to prevent the Pre&s;ident from opening a negociation with
<PB N="82" REF="028437_0089_0FD9021FD786A8C8">
any nation he may think proper.</HI> This is &s;o clearly pointed out by the Con&s;titution, that one is a&s;toni&s;hed to hear it controverted by per&s;ons capable of reading. "He &s;hall," &s;ays that in&s;trument, <Q>have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concur: and he &s;hall nomi|nate, and by and with the advice of the Se|nate, &s;hall appoint Emba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c.</Q> And yet <HI>Franklin,</HI> in one place, in&s;i&s;ts that the term <HI>advice</HI> has a natural and obvious re|ference to negociation <HI>only;</HI> <Q>for, &s;ays he, it would be the extremity of ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that advice was nece&s;&s;ary <HI>after the thing was done.</HI></Q> Whether he has willfully, or through ignorance, confounded <HI>the making</HI> of a treaty with the forming of a treaty, is to me a matter of uncer|tainty (for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities that render either probable), but that he has confounded them is a clear ca&s;e. A treaty is not <HI>made</HI> 'till it be <HI>ratified</HI> and, therefore, pre&s;enting it to the Se|nate for their con&s;ideration, before it be ratifi|ed, is not taking their advice <HI>after the thing is done.</HI> It is taking their advice before it is done; but not, as he &s;eems to think ought to be the ca&s;e, <HI>before it is begun.</HI> The natural and obvi|ous &s;en&s;e, and, indeed, the only &s;en&s;e of the clau&s;e of the Con&s;titution ju&s;t quoted, is, in my opinion; that the Senate is to be con&s;ulted in making treaties, but not in opening negociations.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> has had the ingenuity to give to the words <HI>advice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> an application, that mo&s;t certainly never entered into the thoughts
<PB N="83" REF="028437_0090_0FD902240A762D48">
of tho&s;e who framed the Con&s;titution. Can he be &s;erious in confining <HI>advice</HI> to what precedes the negociation, and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to what follows it? If this were correct, the Senate ought never to give their con&s;ent to a negociation, nor their advice concerning a ratification.</P>
<P>To me the &s;en&s;e of the Con&s;titution is ex|tremely clear, as to this point. The words <HI>ad|vice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> have both a reference to what follows the negociation; and this will fully ap|pear, if their import in the latter part of the above clau&s;e be well weighed. <Q>The Pre&s;ident &s;hall nominate, and, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, appoint Emba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c.</Q> Now, if <HI>advice</HI> in the making of treaties, has a natural and obvious reference to <HI>negociation;</HI> &s;o, in the appointment of Emba&s;&s;adors, it mu&s;t have reference to <HI>nomination.</HI> I leave any one to judge how non&s;en&s;ical it would have been to authorize the Senate to con&s;ent to the appoint|ment of a per&s;on, who&s;e nomination they had before <HI>advi&s;ed;</HI> and yet it would not be more &s;o than to give them the power of con&s;enting to the terms of a treaty formed by their <HI>advice.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, it would be &s;landering the Con&s;titu|tion, to &s;uppo&s;e that it contained any thing approaching &s;o near to the anarchical, as to &s;ubject the particular objects of a negoci|ation to an a&s;&s;embly, not obliged to &s;ecrecy, before the negociation is opened. Were this ever to be the ca&s;e, it ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to conclude any treaty of mo|ment, or, at lea&s;t, to conclude it with
<PB N="84" REF="028437_0091_0FD90225706A97A0">
advantage. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that the threatened rupture with Great Britain had ren|dered it nece&s;&s;ary for you to form a clo&s;e alli|ance with &s;ome power in Europe, and that the Pre&s;ident had been obliged to make known every &s;tipulation to be made on your part, before the departure of the Envoy; can you believe that, with &s;uch a per&s;on as <HI>Mr. Ma&s;on</HI> in the Senate (and, from the degeneracy of human nature, you ought to expect that there ever will be &s;ome &s;uch in it), the affair would have been kept &s;ecret, 'till concluded? or even 'till it was begun? No; I'll be hanged if it would. It would have been known in London long before the Envoy's arrival in Europe, and you would have had an Engli&s;h fleet upon your coa&s;t, be|fore he could po&s;&s;ibly have fulfilled his mi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Among thirty per&s;ons there mu&s;t ever be a difference in opinion, there mu&s;t ever be a majority and a minority, and a recent, a very recent, example ought to convince you, that a per&s;on of a factious di&s;po&s;ition, who has the mortification to find his &s;chemes di&s;concerted, to find him&s;elf lurched in a mi|nority, will go above half way to hell to fru&s;|trate the intentions of the majority. It was there|fore wi&s;e in the framers of the Con&s;titution to give the Pre&s;ident a power to treat, without previou&s;ly con&s;ulting the Senate with re&s;pect to the objects to be obtained by the treaty.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Pre&s;ident ought to be impeached, according to <HI>Franklin, for his re&s;erve towards the people.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028437_0092_0FD9022AA279F938">When ignorance or factiou&s;ne&s;s, or both to|gether, have led a man beyond the bounds of truth and candour, they never let him go, 'till they have plunged him into an aby&s;s of ab&s;urdity. Thus has it happened to <HI>Frank|lin.</HI> After having per&s;uaded him&s;elf that the Pre&s;ident ought to withhold nothing from the knowledge of the other branches of the legi&s;la|ture, it was natural for him to pur&s;ue the error, 'till he found, that, <Q>to withhold the con|tents of a treaty from <HI>the people,</HI> 'till it was ratified, indicated a contempt for public opi|nion, and a monarchical &s;upremacy.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ays that Republics ought to have no &s;ecrets, and adds, in the words of <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> "the &s;ecrets of courts, like tho&s;e of individuals, are always their defects."

When this Con&s;titution begins to operate, there will, undoubtedly, be no &s;uch thing as &s;ecrecy in the happy country which is to be governed by it; but it will be prudent in you to wait, 'till you &s;ee its effects, before you act upon its principles;

and, in the mean time, as you enjoy peace and pro&s;perity under your pre&s;ent half-Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, it will be right to guard it as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the attacks of the modern <HI>Patriots.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In the compact, &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> entered into by the citizens ot the United States, cer|tain conce&s;&s;ions were made by them, and the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions are &s;pecified in the Con&s;ti|tution; but, have they conceded a right to an acquaintance with their own affairs?</Q> Yes, if his que&s;tion applies, as it evidently does to the terms of an unratified treaty, the people have conceded a right to an acquaintance with their own affairs; for, in the right of making treaties is nece&s;&s;arily included the right of ob|&s;erving a prudent &s;ecrecy concerning them, and, as the former is expre&s;ly conceded to the Pre&s;ident and Senate, &s;o is the latter. The people have conceded the right of making trea|ties, and the conce&s;&s;ion is unconditional; they have made it without re&s;erving to them&s;elves the right of demanding their promulgation, be|fore they become the law of the land; with|out re&s;erving to them&s;elves the right of advi&s;ing, di&s;puting, and caballing about their contents, before they are known, or of tormenting and reviling the Executive, and burning the nego|ciators in effigy, when their contents are known.</P>
<P>But, would not <HI>Franklin</HI> be very far from being content with the people's having this knowledge of their own affairs? Would he be willing to &s;top here? No. "Where the

<PB N="88" REF="028437_0095_0FD90233428B2B38">
obtained. <HI>Franklin's</HI> great fault, as a writer, is, want of memory. Mu&s;t it not &s;hock the reader to hear him give to his <HI>Sovereign People</HI> exactly the &s;ame rights as tho&s;e exerci&s;ed by a <HI>Monarch,</HI> when, in the very &s;ame page, he affirms, that, "to naturalize the practices of Monarchies in a republic is a direliction of every ju&s;t prin|ciple."?</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h the principle that the &s;overeign people ought to take an active part in the ma|king of treaties appears to be the real object of <HI>Franklin,</HI> while he is talking about their being acquainted with their own affairs. <Q>To con|nect, &s;ays he, the &s;ecrecy of a <HI>divan</HI> with the formation of a treaty is to double <HI>the in&s;ecurity</HI> of committing the tru&s;t <HI>out of the hands of the people;</HI> for a treaty may be made to barter away our e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts, and the people may remain ignorant of it, 'till it is too late for a <HI>remedy.</HI></Q> His meaning here is by no means equivocal. If it be in&s;ecure to commit the tru&s;t out of the hands of the people, it ought to remain in their hands: if the people have the right to apply <HI>a remedy,</HI> they mu&s;t have the right of <HI>prevention</HI> al&s;o, which is much bet|ter. And, indeed, this is a &s;elf-evident conclu|&s;ion; for, it would be mere non&s;en&s;e to pretend, that they have a right to be informed of all the &s;ecrets of a negociation, without having a right to break it off. If they have not a right to pre|vent a treaty's going into effect, where would lie the advantage of having it communicated to them previous to its ratification? What &s;ati&s;|faction could they derive from being tanta|lized
<PB N="89" REF="028437_0096_0FD9023474CD74C0">
with a view of dangers, that they could not avoid.</P>
<P><HI>Franklin</HI> has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;omething about conce&s;&s;ions, made by the people; but, according to his &s;ub&s;equent account of the mat|ter, I cannot perceive that they have made any at all. For where is the u&s;e of their having &s;aid to the Pre&s;ident and Senate, <Q>you &s;hall have the <HI>&s;ole</HI> power of making treaties,</Q> if they are to make them them&s;elves? If, not|with&s;tanding their having conceded the power of making treaties to the Pre&s;ident and Senate, they &s;till retain that power, the &s;ame will hold good with re&s;pect to every other power they have conceded by the Con&s;titution; and then, what conce&s;&s;ion have they made? None at all; with their capacity to govern, they &s;till retain all their governing powers, and every nation that would treat with the United States, ought to addre&s;s it&s;elf to His multifarious and many-headed Maje&s;ty, <HI>The People.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Franklin</HI> would advi&s;e the impeachment of the Pre&s;ident, <HI>for having evaded a new trea|ty with France, while he courted one with Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This is the great offence; to bring this home to the Pre&s;ident &s;eems to have been the chief object of <HI>Franklin,</HI> who is affected by nothing that does not concern the French Republic.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any further, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give you a brief hi&s;tory of the "Letters of Franklin." Whoever reads the&s;e letters with the &s;malle&s;t attention, mu&s;t perceive, that
<PB N="90" REF="028437_0097_0FD90235F3010990">
they are, originally, a French production. Every one of them ends with an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;overeign people. The&s;e decla|matory parts betray their origin in a more &s;triking manner than the re&s;t of the per|formance. Here we &s;ee every where a clo&s;e and &s;ervile imitation of the illiterate new fangled jar|gon of the French Convention, a heterogeneous mixture of in&s;olence, &s;ervility, vaunting, and lamentation. The author, or rather tran&s;lator, is ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at, if you pay attention to his affectionate expre&s;&s;ions towards <HI>Citizen Genet.</HI> He calls <HI>Mr. Jay the libeller of Citizen Ge|net;</HI>" and great part of his malice again&s;t that Gentlemen &s;eems to have no other founda|tion. In &s;hort, I am fully per&s;uaded, that this <HI>Franklin</HI> is the &s;ame per&s;onage who rendered him&s;elf &s;o extremely odious in the diplomatic di&s;pute between <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> and your go|vernment.</P>
<P>The quarter, too, from whence the&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> i&s;&s;ued, &s;eems to corre&s;pond with the re&s;t of their hi&s;tory. They were fir&s;t publi&s;hed, in a paper famous for its anti-federal principles. The printer who is al&s;o a <HI>Colonel,</HI> went to France in 1792, to combat, in the cau&s;e of liberty and humanity, again&s;t the &s;atellites of the combined de&s;pots; and he returned to Philadelphia in 1793, about the time that <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> arrived there. What rank this Colonel and Printer bore in the armies of your Si&s;ter Republic, or whether he be <HI>&s;till in her &s;ervice,</HI> I know not; but it ought not to be wondered at, if his zeal in her
<PB N="91" REF="028437_0098_0FD9023ACC531B08">
cau&s;e, in "the cau&s;e of the human race," &s;hould have prompted him to &s;erve her in Phila|delphia as well as in Flanders; the Colonel might do as much execution with his printer's balls as with his cannon balls; perhaps more; and (which is a circum&s;tance by no means to be overlooked) the former are employed with le&s;s danger than the latter.</P>
<P>Now, with this key, you will be able to en|ter into the &s;pirit of many expre&s;&s;ions and pa&s;|&s;ages of <HI>Franklin,</HI> which, without it, mu&s;t appear totally incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P><Q>We have, &s;ays <HI>Franklin,</HI> treated the <HI>overtures</HI> of France for a treaty, with neg|lect. The nation that has barbarou&s;ly in|&s;ulted us, and plundered us, we have court|ed, <HI>meanly courted,</HI> and the nation <HI>on whom our political exi&s;tence depends,</HI> and who <HI>has treated us with affection,</HI> we have treated with indifference bordering on contempt. <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> was empowered to propo&s;e a treaty with us on liberal principles, &s;uch as might &s;trengthen the bonds of good will which <HI>unite</HI> the two nations.</Q> How your government has <HI>courted</HI> Great Britain, how your political exi&s;tence depends on France, and how &s;he has treated you with affection, we have already &s;een; it only re|mains for us to &s;ee what were the "liberal principles," which Citizen Genet was autho|rized to treat upon, and whether it was pru|dent on your part, to refu&s;e to treat upon tho&s;e "liberal principles," or not.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="028437_0099_0FD9023E306A5D08">But, previou&s;ly, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, let the&s;e "liberal principles" be what they might, the Pre&s;ident's conduct in refu&s;ing or evading to treat on them could amount to no more than <HI>imprudence.</HI> The Pre&s;ident, I agree, has power to open negociations with any nation he thinks proper, and then, &s;ays <HI>Frank|lin,</HI> <Q>why did he not treat with <HI>Citizen Ge|net?</HI></Q> To which I an&s;wer, that the Con&s;ti|tution, in authorizing the Pre&s;ident to open ne|gociations with any nation whom <HI>he thinks pro|per</HI> to treat with, has not obliged him to open negociations with every nation that thinks pro|per to treat with him. It has not obliged him to open negociations with a nation &s;o circum|&s;tanced as not to be depended on for the value of a cargo of flour, with a nation in jeopardy, with an a&s;&s;embly who had declared them&s;elves a committe of in&s;urrection again&s;t every go|vernment on earth not founded on their prin|ciples, with an Executive Council compo&s;ed of half a dozen unhappy wretches, who were all either publicly executed or outlawed, before the treaty with them could have been ratified; no; the Con&s;titution has obliged him to no|thing of this &s;ort, if it had I am &s;ure, he never would have accepted the po&s;t of Pre&s;ident. The Con&s;titution has left it intirely to his own pru|dence to make or to avoid treaties; whether he has on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, made a good u&s;e of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, or not, we &s;hall now &s;ee.</P>
<P>As a preliminary, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Pre&s;ident's <HI>Proclamation of Neutrality</HI> was re|ceived
<PB N="93" REF="028437_0100_0FD902401AA653A0">
by you all, with a very few exceptions, with the mo&s;t unequivocal marks of approbation. If, then, the treaty propo&s;ed by <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> went directly to render that Proclamation nugatory, or to make it a ma&s;que to cover the ho&s;tilities of &s;uch Americans as cho&s;e to make war upon the enemies of France, you will be obliged to approve of the Pre&s;i|dent's conduct in avoiding to treat with <HI>Citizen Genet,</HI> or expo&s;e your&s;elves to a charge of the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Citizen's</HI> arrival at Philadel|phia, he announced to the Pre&s;ident, through the Secretary of State, that he was authorized to open a negociation with the government of the United States.

One would imagine by its out&s;et, that the French Convention was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;uffer you to remain in peace, <Q>notwith&s;tand|ing &s;he had a right to reclaim the obligations impo&s;ed on the United States, and which &s;he had cemented with <HI>her blood;</HI></Q> but, what follows &s;eems to overturn this &s;uppo&s;ition; for the Citizen declares that <Q>the emi&s;&s;aries of your <HI>common enemies</HI> were making <HI>u&s;ele&s;s efforts</HI> to <HI>neutralize</HI> the gratitude, and to damp the zeal of your fellow citizens &amp;c.</Q> <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> arrived &s;oon after the proclamation of neutrality was i&s;&s;ued, and he took the earlie&s;t opportunity of declaring, that <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> efforts had been made to <HI>neutralize</HI> the gratitude of the ci|tizens of America; and yet <HI>Franklin</HI> and all the other &s;tipendiaries of France a&s;&s;ert, that <Q>France with a magnanimity which &s;he alone &s;eems &s;u&s;ceptible of, has not urged the fulfillment of her treaty with you; but that, &s;he has expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;h, and her conduct has pro|ved it, that you &s;hould remain in peace.</Q></P>
<P>We will allow that <HI>Citizen Genet's</HI> letter might mean, that France wi&s;hed you to remain in peace (for it may be made to mean any thing) yet that letter is not the document to which you are to look, to know the gracious intentions of your Si&s;ter Republic. At the &s;ame time that the Citizen came forward with his republican <HI>fanfaronnade</HI> to propo&s;e negociations; he carried in his pocket certain <HI>in&s;tructions</HI> according to which the propo&s;ed treaty was to be formed, and from which he could not depart.

that I am going to make from tho&s;e in|&s;tructions, it will appear to every one of you, who is not &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the French as to be incapable of conviction, that the new treaty was to accord you no advantages, of which your participation in the war was not to be the price, and that <HI>Citizen Genet</HI> was to plunge you into a war, with or without the con&s;ent of your government, to make a diver&s;ion in favour of France, at the expence of your pro&s;perity, and even your very exi&s;tence as a nation.</P>
<P><HI>Citizen Genet,</HI> though abundantly a&s;&s;uming and in&s;olent, though uniting the levity of a Frenchman to the boori&s;hne&s;s of a Calmuck, though de&s;erving of much cen&s;ure from your go|vernment, has, however, been loaded with a great deal of unmerited odium by the people of the United States. The man acted in full conformity to his in&s;tructions in all his attacks on your independence, and, therefore, his con|duct is to be attributed to the Government of France, or the &s;overeign people of that <HI>happy</HI> Republic, and not to the poor citizen him&s;elf. He was a mere machine in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and his not being ordered home to an&s;wer for his con|duct, is a &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof, that the &s;overeigns of France apprroved of it, without daring to avow it openly. I &s;ay without <HI>da|ring</HI> to avow it; becau&s;e, though you could not have directly cha&s;ti&s;ed them, yet they wanted your flour, and it is well known, that empty cupboards are no le&s;s formidable than great guns.</P>

<P>The only fair way for you to judge of the Pre|&s;ident's conduct relative to the treaty negoci|ated with Great Britain, and the one propo&s;ed by France, is, to draw a compari&s;on between your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the &s;ituation in which you would have now been, had he fol|lowed a different conduct. As the tree is known by its fruit, &s;o are the mea&s;ures of the &s;tate&s;man by their effects. Look round you, and ob&s;erve well the &s;pectacle that the United States pre&s;ent at this moment.

The pro|duce of the country would have been at about one third of its pre&s;ent price, while every im|ported article would have ri&s;en in a like propor|tion. The farmer mu&s;t have &s;old his wheat at four &s;hillings a bu&s;hel in place of fourteen, and in place of giving four dollars a yard for cloth, he mu&s;t have given ten or twelve. Hou&s;es and lands, in&s;tead of being ri&s;en to tripple their former value, as they now are, would have fallen to one third of that value, and mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, have been taxed to nearly half their rent. In &s;hort, you would have been in the &s;ame &s;ituation as you were in 1777, and without the &s;ame means of extricating your|&s;elves from it. However, &s;uch a &s;ituation might,
<PB N="102" REF="028437_0109_0FD9025B02EDE890">
perhaps, be a de&s;irable one to you. Habit does great things. People who were revolution mad, might look back with regret to the e|poch ju&s;t mentioned, and might even view with envy the effects of the French Revolution. If &s;o, it is by no means too late yet; the Pre&s;ident has only to refu&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ratification of the treaty with Great Britain, and adopt the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by the hone&s;t and <HI>incorruptible</HI> friends of the French Republic, and you may &s;oon have your fill of what you de&s;ire. If you have wi&s;hed to enjoy, once more, the charms of change, and ta&s;te the &s;weets of war and anar|chy (for I look upon them as in&s;eparable in this country,) then, the Pre&s;ident may merit an im|peachment at your hands; but, if you have de&s;ired to live in peace and plenty, while the re&s;t of the world has been ravaged and de&s;ola|ted, to accu&s;e the Pre&s;ident now, is to re&s;emble the crew of ungrateful buccaniers, who, having &s;afely arrived in port, cut the throat of their pilot.</P>

<P>THE proceedings of the <HI>Patriots,</HI> previous to the departure of <HI>Mr. Jay,</HI> and during his ab&s;ence, throw a good deal of light on their pre&s;ent ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition to the treaty. At the time of <HI>Mr. Jay's</HI> appointment as Envoy, a recent di&s;pute had convinced the public that he was no friend to the dragooning &s;y&s;tem, pro|po&s;ed by <HI>Citizen Genet,</HI> and adhered to by the war, or confi&s;cating, party in Congre&s;s. The <HI>Patriots</HI> were morally certain, that a continua|tion of peace between Great Britain and this country would be the con&s;equence of his mi&s;&s;i|on, and, of cour&s;e, that their golden dreams of plunder would end as dreams generally do end. Accordingly, no &s;ooner was his appointment made known, than the whole Union began to ring with their vociferations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Democratic Society</HI> of Penn&s;ylvania (ne|ver la&s;t in the pur&s;uit of mi&s;chief) gave the &s;ig|nal of malcontentedne&s;s. They publi&s;hed their <HI>re&s;olves</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e <HI>re&s;olves</HI> have been re-publi&s;hed &s;ince the return of <HI>Mr. Jay.</HI> This is &s;aying to the people: <HI>look here; what we foretold is now come to pa&s;s!</HI> The democrats knew what <HI>Mr. Jay</HI> ought to do, it was not, therefore, very difficult for them to foretell what he would do, and to condemn it beforehand; neverthele&s;s they now hold up their predic|tions as a proof of their &s;agacity.

which, in the <HI>patriotic</HI> cant of the day, they term their "Si&s;ter Societies." It is unnece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ay what were the &s;entiments contained in the&s;e re&s;olves; as is the &s;ource, &s;o is the &s;tream. One circum&s;tance ought not, however, to pa&s;s unnoticed: joining France in the pre&s;ent war appeared to be the leading object of every one of the &s;ocieties. Then &s;entiments, and even expre&s;&s;ions, on this &s;ubject bear &s;uch a perfect re&s;emblance, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not have been pre&s;cribed by &s;ome agent of <Q>that regenerated, rich, great, generous, hu|mane, happy, valiant and victorious republic.</Q></P>

If all tyrants unite again&s;t free people, &s;hould not all free people unite again&s;t tyrants?

<P>Nor were the <HI>Patriots</HI> idle during the ab&s;ence of the Envoy. Every piece of news, that could be picked up concerning his conduct at the Court of St. James's, was made the means of &s;arca&s;m, and conjured into progno&s;tics of his making a di&s;honourable treaty. Even the for|malities of his introduction at Court could not e&s;cape the malicious ob&s;ervatlons of the <HI>patriotic</HI> crew. His ki&s;&s;ing the Queen's hand was term|ed <Q>pro&s;trating at the feet of Maje&s;ty the &s;ove|reignty of a great people,</Q> and for which it was affirmed he de&s;erved to have "his lips bli&s;ter|ed to the bone."

<P>From men in this dispo&s;ition of mind, it was to be expected that any arrangement, tending to prevent a rupture with Great Britain, would
<PB N="106" REF="028437_0113_0FD902685A3DFCB0">
meet a clamorous oppo&s;ition; but few people, I believe, thought that the fir&s;t attack would come from a member of the Senate. Nobody imagined, that any member of that venerable body would have &s;o far lo&s;t &s;ight of his country's intere&s;t, of its peace, as to divulge the terms of an unratified treaty, and even become in&s;tru|mental in its promulgation, not only without the permi&s;&s;ion, but again&s;t the wi&s;h and inten|tion of the Pre&s;ident and the majority of the Se|nate. <HI>Mr. Ma&s;on's</HI> motives were but too evi|dent. He might have &s;aid to him&s;elf (with the hypocritical <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> after he had di|vulged to the plebians the Will of Cae&s;ar); <Q>Now let it work. Mischief thou art a foot, take thou what cour&s;e thou wilt.</Q></P>
<P>The effects of this legi&s;lative tattling were not long in di&s;covering them&s;elves. The trea|ty was publi&s;hed at Philadelphia on the 2d. of July, prefaced by a letter from <HI>Mr. Ma&s;on,</HI> authorizing the printer to make what u&s;e of it he thought proper. On the fourth of July the mo&s;t &s;candalous &s;cene was exhibited, in this capital of the Union, that ever di&s;graced a civilized country. To avoid a charge of mi&s;|repre&s;entation here, I &s;hall give an account of it in the <HI>Patriots'</HI> own words, as publi&s;hed in their gazette, the <HI>Aurora,</HI> of the 9th July.</P>
<P><Q>The day (the 4th. of July,) was clo&s;ed by the exhibition of a tran&s;parent painting with the figure of <HI>John Jay</HI> upon it. The figure was in full &s;tatue, holding in his right hand a pair of &s;cales, containing in one &s;cale, <HI>American liberty and Independence,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="028437_0114_0FD90269DFC10B28">
kicking the beam; in the other, <HI>Briti&s;h Gold,</HI> in extreme preponderance. In his left hand a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, which he extended to a group of Senators, who were grinning with plea&s;ure and gra&s;ping at the Treaty. From the mouth of the figure i&s;&s;ued the&s;e words, <HI>come up to my price, and I will &s;ell you my country.</HI> The figure was burned at Ken&s;ing|ton amid the acclamations of hundreds of <HI>citizens.</HI> Thus ended the proce&s;&s;ion, and thus terminated the anniver&s;ary of American Independence.</Q></P>
<P>This was a good &s;etting out. Meanwhile the Treaty got &s;pread about, and a &s;y&s;tematical op|po&s;ition to it was determined on. The fir&s;t re|mon&s;trance was drawn up at Bo&s;ton, and in &s;uch ha&s;te were the <HI>citizens</HI> of that town to get the &s;tart of tho&s;e of other places, that the fir&s;t copy of the treaty had not been arrived in town twenty four hours, before a town meeting was convened to condemn it. At this meeting a motion was made to read the treaty, at lea&s;t, before they remon&s;trated again&s;t it; but this motion was not even &s;econded.</P>
<P>The <HI>citizens</HI> of New York were not much be|hind their <HI>brethren</HI> of Bo&s;ton in point of time, and in other re&s;pects very far out&s;tripped them. A town meeting being called to take the treaty into con&s;ideration, a great number of per|&s;ons, of all de&s;criptions attended. A chairman being named, a propo&s;ition was made for ad|journing to &s;ome more convenient place for a fair and full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the treaty, but this
<PB N="108" REF="028437_0115_0FD9026B9A745E90">
was oppo&s;ed with much clamour by many of the <HI>citizens.</HI> There appeared, however, to be a majority in favour of a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, but tho&s;e who were again&s;t it were the mo&s;t noi&s;y; interruption, di&s;order and confu&s;ion en&s;ued. <Q>In the cour&s;e of the affair three &s;tones were thrown at Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was for a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the &s;econd of which glanced his forehead, one of the others &s;truck a gentle|man &s;tanding by him. From the beginning &s;tandards were di&s;played bearing the colours of the United States and France. A party of tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion went off to the battery, bearing a &s;tandard with French and American colours, where they burnt the treaty, and then returned with an acce&s;&s;ion of numbers.</Q> Now, will any one in his &s;en&s;es believe, that this rabble, or, at lea&s;t their ringleaders, were not hired to oppo&s;e the government on this occa&s;ion? What did the French flag do at this meeting?

<P>There was certainly a very great majority of the merchants, traders, and people of proper|ty, of New York in favour of the treaty and yet brick-back eloquence has prevailed, and a re|mon&s;trance has been &s;ent off to the Pre&s;ident.</P>

A va&s;t concour&s;e of <HI>Citizens</HI> of the right true blue &s;tamp a&s;&s;embled nearly in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as the <HI>citizens</HI> of New York. It would be u&s;ele&s;s to de&s;cribe the &s;tu|pid &s;tare, the dirty &s;hirts, and long beards, of the&s;e &s;overeigns, or the <HI>patriotic</HI> &s;trut an ima|ginary con&s;equence of their chairman and com|mittee men. I &s;hall notice only a circum&s;tance or two, which, though trifling in them&s;elves, characterize the meeting better, perhaps, than the mo&s;t minute account of their proceedings and principles could do.</P>
<P>The important bu&s;ine&s;s being ended, a <HI>citi|zen</HI> made a motion, that the welcome of the meeting &s;hould be given to a firm friend of the <HI>Rights of man,</HI> ju&s;t arrived from Ireland (la&s;t from France), <HI>Citizen Archibald Hamilton Rowan.</HI> The name of <HI>Rowan</HI> was hardly out of his mouth, when the whole a&s;&s;embly bur&s;t out into an acclamation, &s;uch as is heard from the &s;ummit of mount Rhodope, when the drun|ken God retires to his plea&s;ures; or (to make u&s;e of an apter compari&s;on) &s;uch as re&s;ounds through the infernal regions, when Satan an|nounces the arrival of one doubly damned. Silence being at la&s;t re&s;tored, the &s;ame <HI>citizen,</HI> holding up a little pamphlet containing one of <HI>Mr. Ma&s;on's</HI> treaties, exclaimed, <Q>what a damned treaty!</Q> After a &s;hort pau&s;e, he continued; <Q>I make a motion, that every good citizen in this a&s;&s;embly kick this damn|ed treaty to Hell.</Q> He mu&s;t have &s;up|po&s;ed that his good <HI>fellow citizens</HI> know the way
<PB N="110" REF="028437_0117_0FD9027170A34370">
to Hell; and to tell the truth, &s;ome of them had much more the appearance of furies than of &s;ober hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting being clo&s;ed by this <HI>patriotic</HI> exhortation, &s;ome of the lukewarm <HI>citizens</HI> retired home, while others of a more determined character paid the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mr. Bingham</HI> a vi&s;it. It was thought by &s;ome, that violence was their intention; but they were &s;o moderate as to be contented with in&s;ult and ex|ecration. Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> has, without di&s;pute, the fine&s;t hou&s;e in the city, and he is &s;aid to be, be&s;ides, one of the wealthie&s;t as well as worthi|e&s;t men in the country; it mu&s;t, therefore, be confe&s;&s;ed, that he was, on every account, a proper object of attack.</P>
<P>Such are the oppo&s;ers of the treaty, &s;uch the <HI>&s;overeign people,</HI> who are now tormenting the Pre&s;ident with their remon&s;trances, which &s;ome of them have the in&s;olence to call, <Q>in&s;tructi|ons to their <HI>public &s;ervant,</HI></Q> and who will ere long, unle&s;s their power be contracted, ty|rannize over the peaceable inhabitants of the&s;e States. When once the lower orders of the people, tho&s;e who have nothing, begin to give law to tho&s;e who have &s;omething, a &s;tate of a|narchy is at no great di&s;tance. This dreadful &s;courge now menaces the United States, and the only way of avoiding it is for every hone&s;t man, every man of property, to give his hearty and &s;incere &s;upport to the General Government.</P>

<P>I have this moment ca&s;t my eyes on an ex|tract of a letter from Mr. <HI>Pinckney,</HI> the Ame|rican Emba&s;&s;ador in London, which I think well worthy of a place here; becau&s;e <HI>Franklin</HI> after &s;ome compliments to the patrioti&s;m of that gentleman in&s;i&s;ts that, if the negociation had been left to him, you would have had a treaty <Q>&s;uch as would have been worthy an independent nation.</Q> What will this de|magogue now &s;ay</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Thomas Pinckney, Mini&s;ter Ple|nipotentiary, to the Secretary of State, dated London, 16th November, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Jay communicated freely with me on this &s;ubject during the cour&s;e of the negociation, and I have wit|ne&s;&s;ed the great difficulties which have occurred in ad|ju&s;ting &s;everal of the articles. Although &s;ome points might have been arranged more beneficially for us if the treaty had been dictated entirely by the United States, yet when it is con&s;idered as a compo&s;ition of dif|ferences, where mutual complaints had rendered mutual conce&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a good under&s;tanding, I think it may fairly be &s;aid, that as little has been conced|ed by Mr. Jay, and as much obtained for the United States as, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, could be expected: the bu&s;ine&s;s upon the whole, has been concluded more beneficially for us than I had any hope we could obtain by negociation &s;ix months ago, and, in my opinion; places us in a more advantageous &s;ituation than we &s;hould have been by becoming parties to the war.</P>
