<HEAD>A SERIOUS ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE religious ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, in an holy ab&s;tinence from the common bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ements of life and a devout attendance upon Publick Wor&s;hip, is &s;trongly recom|mended by the command of God, and the practice of his people; by many expre&s;s a&s;&s;urances of his gracious approbation of tho&s;e who have &s;o kept the day holy,&mdash;and by &s;olemn threatenings again&s;t &s;uch as im|piou&s;ly profane it. <Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord, take heed to your&s;elves, and bear no burden on the &s;abbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the &s;abbath day as I commanded your fathers. Jer. xvii. 21, 22. If thou turn away thy foot, on account of the &s;abbath, from doing thy plea&s;ure on my holy day, and call the &s;abbath a delight, holy of the Lord and honourable, and &s;halt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea&s;ure, nor &s;peaking thine own words, then thou &s;halt delight thy|&s;elf in the Lord, &amp;c. I&s;aiah lviii. 13.
<PB N="4" REF="018896_0003_0FA82B06DF31A050">Who&s;oever doeth any work therein, that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from among&s;t his people. Exod. xxxi, 14.</Q></P>
<P>The notorious profanation of the chri&s;ti|an &s;abbath by per&s;ons that call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, either in unnece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s or journeys, carnal plea&s;ures or idle vi&s;its is a &s;ad evidence of that infidelity and impiety which neither fear God nor regard man: e&s;pecially among a people upon whom the &s;anctification of the &s;abbath, by refraining from the&s;e practices and attending upon publick wor&s;hip, is &s;trictly enjoined both by the laws of God and their country. But I would hope better things of many into who&s;e hands this addre&s;s may fall; that they neither openly profane the Sabbath, nor entirely for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them|&s;elves together; nay that &s;ome of my rea|ders, &s;incerely concerned for the honour and &s;ucce&s;s of divine ordinances, lament every irregularity ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e who attend upon them. And an irregularity they mu&s;t certainly acknowledge it is, to come late to the hou&s;e of God. The prevalence of this evil cu&s;tom in &s;ome congregations has been long complained of both by mini&s;ters and private chri&s;tians: they are convinced of the impropriety of the practice: they &s;ee and feel many inconveniences ari&s;ing from
<PB N="5" REF="018896_0004_0FA82B078C90A8D8">it: and are apprehen&s;ive it cannot but be di&s;plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God. For their &s;akes, and from a real regard to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of all who may have been affected by it, I beg leave, in the following pages, to recommend a more exact and regular attendance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take it for granted that my reader acknowledges it his duty to attend upon divine ordinances&mdash;that hours of atten|dance are fixed, as convenient as may be to the majority of tho&s;e who u&s;ually meet at the &s;ame place;&mdash;and that methods are, or may be made u&s;e of by every one for a&s;|certaining them. I cannot likewi&s;e but be|lieve that mo&s;t &s;erious chri&s;tians as well as mini&s;ters acknowledge the evil of coming late into the hou&s;e of God, and lament and blame the practice in others; nor &s;hould I &s;uppo&s;e that any &s;uch would attempt to ju&s;tify it in them&s;elves. To confirm &s;uch in &s;o good a cu&s;tom who have hitherto maintained it, and to &s;ecure a more con&s;tant and &s;erious attention to it in others who have been remi&s;s, I would remind them,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That an early attendance is decent and orderly.</HI> The apo&s;tle Paul has enjoined it upon chri&s;tians that "all things be done decently and in order," 1 Cor. xiv. 40. The precept ought to be attended to through
<PB N="6" REF="018896_0005_0FA82B08CB08AD30">life: even in the common and le&s;s intere&s;t|ing concerns of it in the &s;hop, in the field, and in our own hou&s;es; but much more in the hou&s;e of God, and in matters that re&s;pect and decorum of divine in&s;titutions. And does it not appear to every one high|ly proper and becoming that the &s;ame &s;o|ciety, meeting together in the &s;ame place, to engage in the &s;ame devotional &s;ervices, &s;hould all enter upon the &s;olemn &s;ervice together, and be able to continue in it without interruption? Is not every one &s;truck with the impropriety of a mini&s;ter's being obliged to begin with little more than half his congregation? Are not the laws of decency and good order notoriou&s;|ly violated by tho&s;e who are breaking in upon the wor&s;hip and a&s;&s;embly of the peo|ple of God five, ten, or fifteen minutes after the time appointed? This is certain|ly indecent and di&s;orderly, and ought therefore to be avoided, e&s;pecially as,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The whole &s;ervice is of &s;uch importance that no part of it &s;hould be lo&s;t.</HI> It is in&s;ti|tuted for the good of &s;ouls: to fit them for an honourable and u&s;eful di&s;charge of all the duties of this life, and for joining the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect in the devout, exerci&s;es of the temple of God above. He that appointed the means
<PB N="7" REF="018896_0006_0FA82B09569737E8">knew our need of them; and, unle&s;s utter &s;trangers to our own hearts, we mu&s;t know it our&s;elves. A wi&s;e concern, therefore, for our be&s;t intere&s;t, will teach us to value tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons and privileges which are adapted to promote it, and make us un|willing to &s;uffer delays by which it would be in any mea&s;ure injured.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>By coming late, per&s;ons not only lo&s;e an important part of the &s;ervice, but are like to &s;uffer di&s;advantage through the whole.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the introductory part of divine &s;ervice be &s;inging, reading the &s;criptures, or praying for a ble&s;&s;ing on the whole, no one of the&s;e &s;acred exerci&s;es can be neglected without &s;uffering lo&s;s; and yet &s;ome per|&s;ons, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, are often too late for them all. Be&s;ides depriving them&s;elves of the&s;e, &s;uch forfeit that ble&s;&s;ing, upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of all ordinances depend, when they neglect to unite with his people in a&s;king it: and &s;ome are hereby thrown into that hurry and di&s;compo&s;ure of mind which mu&s;t unfit them for engaging with advantage on the &s;ub&s;equent part of the &s;ervice. Thus are they &s;inning again&s;t their own &s;ouls, and almo&s;t as effectually lo&s;ing the benefit of their &s;acred and mo&s;t valuable privileges as if they entirely neglected them. It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="018896_0007_0FA82B09D7386988">
IV. <HI>The time u&s;ually employed in publick wor&s;hip, is &s;hort.</HI> I cannot expect this con|&s;ideration will be felt or even acknowledged by tho&s;e who have no reli&s;h for divine or|dinances. They &s;ay, of every hour &s;pent in the wor&s;hip of God, <Q>What a weari|ne&s;s is it! when will the Sabbath, when will the &s;ervice be over!</Q> But the devout mind mu&s;t account all the hours of it &s;hort, not only in compari&s;on of the wor&s;hip of heaven, where the &s;ervants of God are re|pre&s;ented as &s;erving God day and night in his temple, but &s;hort likewi&s;e when compar|ed with the hours employed in worldly bu|&s;ine&s;s, animal gratifications, and the pur&s;uit of temporary gain. The whole Sabbath is but one day in &s;even, and only three or four hours of that are &s;pent in publick wor&s;hip. And when we have not more than one for|tieth part of our time for &s;o rea&s;onable and important a &s;ervice, it would be equally fooli&s;h and ungrateful to &s;uffer the lea&s;t lo&s;s of &s;o &s;mall a proportion of our lives; e&s;pe|cially con&s;idering the precarious tenure up|on which we hold the&s;e privileges. We may &s;oon be confined from ordinances; very &s;oon be deprived of them, and that forever. Say not "you lo&s;e little"&mdash;out of a little, that little is too much to be lo&s;t; and remem|ber that evil habits grow. If you can &s;a|tisfy
<PB N="9" REF="018896_0008_0FA82B0A8DD2D950">your&s;elf in lo&s;ing five minutes now, by and by you may be ea&s;y with the lo&s;s of ten; and it will be nothing &s;trange if, by growing indulgences of this &s;ort, you be|come quite carele&s;s about the time of com|ing, and ere long entirely ab&s;ent your&s;elf one part of the day, nay at length quite for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embly of God's people&mdash;Many have run great lengths in impiety from very &s;mall beginnings.&mdash;It therefore concerns us, in this ca&s;e as in all others, to attend to the coun&s;el of the apo&s;tle Paul, <Q>Ab&s;tain from the appearances of evil.</Q> It is further ob&s;ervable, that,</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>The things which u&s;ually occa&s;ion delays can neither ju&s;tify the inregularity, nor make us amends for the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by it.</HI> The mo&s;t con&s;cientious, regular, and zealous chri&s;tians, may &s;ometimes be unavoidably late through the great di&s;tances of their habitations. Though it has been long and generally ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who come from villages, two, three, four, and five miles off, are more regular and early in their attendance, than many who live within a few doors of the &s;anctuary. And I will beg leave to carry the ob&s;ervation farther, as I have &s;een, and heard of, poor chri&s;tians, and even pious women who have been in their places in the hou&s;e of God,
<PB N="10" REF="018896_0009_0FA82B0B492B1F48">after toiling through foul weather and bad roads on foot, &s;ometime before many of their wealthy neighbours who have hor&s;es, and even carriages to conduct them thither. Yet through di&s;tance, unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons, and a difference of clocks, per&s;ons may &s;ome|times be not only innocently, but pitiably late. Bodily infirmities or nece&s;&s;ary engage|ments may detain &s;ome, and works of mercy others. But little need be &s;aid up|on this &s;ubject if the&s;e were the only occa|&s;ions of the irregularity long complained of in many of our religious a&s;&s;emblies. Is it not often the con&s;equence of lying unne|ce&s;&s;arily and unrea&s;onably late in bed on the Lord's-day morning? Does not an un|due attention to dre&s;s, or too much concern about provi&s;ions for the body, often occa&s;i|on this &s;ymptom of indifference to the &s;piri|tual entertainments of the hou&s;e of God? Is not the true rea&s;on why &s;ome are no earlier there, that they have been bu&s;ying them&s;elves needle&s;sly and criminally in their own hou&s;es, nay in their &s;hops or in their fields? Are not others indolently &s;auntering away the hours of public wor|&s;hip in idle amu&s;ements, or &s;uffering them|&s;elves to be betrayed into an indecency af|fronting to their Lord and his church, in complai&s;ance to the ill-timed intru&s;ions of
<PB N="11" REF="018896_0010_0FA82B0C1044A858">Company; who at &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the ju&s;t apology and reproof of a previous and more important engage|ment? Per&s;ons who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be thereby detained from the hou&s;e of God, &s;eem afraid of being wearied with the length of the &s;ervice, or want &s;pirit and management to contrive for it. No one will dare to offer &s;uch excu&s;es as the&s;e to the Ma&s;ter of a&s;&s;emblies; there are few but would be a&s;hamed to urge them in vindication of their conduct to their fellow wor&s;hippers. Whatever advantages any may expect from trifling with ordinances on &s;uch con&s;iderati|ons they will find them a poor recompence for the lo&s;s of one &s;ingle &s;abbath, or even the lea&s;t part of its &s;acred &s;ervices. Need I remind my reader,</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>That the &s;pirit and practice of the peo|ple of God in all ages of the Church</HI> is a far|ther recommendation of a diligent and re|gular attendance upon divine ordinances. The devout I&s;raelite, when confined from them, poured out his &s;oul in the mo&s;t bitter lamentations, and made it his fervent pray|er to be re&s;tored to them. P&s;alm 42. "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks &s;o panteth my &s;oul after thee O God, my &s;oul thir&s;teth for God, for the living God, when &s;hall I come and appear before God? P&s;, 63.
<PB N="12" REF="018896_0011_0FA82B0CEE12FF88">O God, thou art my God, early will I &s;eek thee, my fle&s;h longeth for thee, in a dry and thir&s;ty land where no water is, to &s;ee thy power and thy glory &s;o as I have &s;een thee in the &s;anctuary." And again P&s;. 84. My &s;oul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord."&mdash;That good man mo&s;t thankfully embraced the privilege whenever admitted to it, P&s;alm cxxii. "I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, let us go into the hou&s;e of the Lord."</P>
<P>And He who was at once the &s;on of Da|vid and his Lord, even Je&s;us whom we al|&s;o profe&s;s to honour as <HI>our</HI> pattern, has re|commended a decent regard to the ordinan|ces of God's hou&s;e and a diligent attendance upon them by making it his cu&s;tom, as in Luke iv. 6. we are told he did) <Q>to go in|to the &s;ynagogue on the Sabbath day.</Q> Nor let his followers in the pre&s;ent age forget the practice of tho&s;e their brethren in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who, after their Lord's departure, on the fir&s;t day of the week, a&s;&s;embied together for divine wor&s;hip.&mdash;Among other records pre&s;erved of them, that in Acts x. 33. ought by no means to be overlooked or forgotten, where we find that, when Peter came into the a&s;&s;embly, they had to &s;ay, <Q>Now are we all here pre&s;ent before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</Q>
<PB N="13" REF="018896_0012_0FA82B0D8B4E9F70">Our forefathers could frequently &s;ay the &s;ame when they followed their teachers dri|ven into corners, and had travelled many miles in the night to &s;ecure opportunities of attending on their mini&s;trations. <Q>The word of the Lord was precious in tho&s;e days;</Q> and they were unwilling to lo&s;e a moment of tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of grace which they &s;ought for their &s;ouls good at the peril of their lives. Then were chri&s;tians alive to God, and &s;elt the power while they kept up the form of Godline&s;s. They went with pious zeal and eager ha&s;t to the hou&s;e of God in company, in the &s;pirit and language of the recovered captives, a&s;king the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, and &s;aying, "Come, let us join our&s;elves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that &s;hall not be forgotten." Jer. l. 4.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear reciting in this connec|tion a plea&s;ing anecdote related of the inha|bitants of the pari&s;h of <HI>Dur&s;ley</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire;</HI> when under the mini&s;terial care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Woodward;</HI> a faithful and very zealous preacher of the go&s;|pel at the time of Charles the &s;econd's re&s;to|ration, and who, with two thou&s;and of his brethren, was ejected by the act of unifor|mity, Augu&s;t 24, 1662. <Q><HI>Dur&s;ley,</HI> when he came to it, was &s;o very di&s;&s;olute that it
<PB N="14" REF="018896_0013_0FA82B0E69E4FDA8">was commonly called <HI>Drunken Dur&s;ly</HI> But it was much altered both in character and circum&s;tances by his labours.</Q> And (which is the fact I had chiefly in view) <Q>in&s;tead of a contempt for the mini&s;try and ordi|nances of Chri&s;t, and &s;pending their Sab|baths in ale-hou&s;es as they had done before, after he had preached awhile among them, &s;uch was their affection for him, for one another, and the hou&s;e of God, that he &s;eldom went thither alone. For his hou&s;e being di&s;tant from the church the length of a long &s;treet, all got their families ready &s;tanding at their doors as he came by, and &s;o attended him and fell in with the others that were following; &s;o that he literally went with the multitude to the hou&s;e of God. Every one's zeal &s;eemed inflamed by the flame he beheld in his neighbour, and his was the mo&s;t compo&s;ed and affected congregation that could any where be &s;een.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>Noncomformi&s;t's Memorial.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to urge, as a farther con&s;ideration,</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>That coming late occa&s;ions great di&s;|turbances both to mini&s;ters and fellow wor&s;hip|pers.</HI> The comfort of a mini&s;ter's &s;ervices to him&s;elf, and the acceptance with which they are like to be attended to others, de|pend
<PB N="15" REF="018896_0014_0FA82B10D5D76670">greatly, under God, on the compo|&s;ure of mind with which he engages in them. We may therefore urge this argu|ment with our people both on their ac|count and our own.&mdash;You re&s;pect your mini&s;ters, you would not do any thing that &s;hould hurt them, or le&s;&s;en their u&s;efulne&s;s. You know they are thinking, and praying, and labouring for you, in their retiremen's, between one &s;abbath and another. But you have not perhaps con&s;idered a remi&s;s and ir|regular attendance upon their public mini|&s;trations as an ungenerous return for the thought and time they employ, and the pains they take, both in the hou&s;e of God and in their own, for your &s;alvation.&mdash;You do not &s;urely know, cannot conceive the confu&s;ion, the hurry of &s;pirits which coming late occa&s;ions them: how often they lo&s;e that recollection and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves by it, which is ever of great importance. You would feel the inconvenience your&s;elves if your dome&s;tics were coming in conti|nually while you were engaged in your family devotions; but perhaps not half &s;o much in your private dwellings and &s;mall hou&s;|holds as mini&s;ters do before many hundreds in publick a&s;&s;emblies. Indeed all around are immediately affected by this irregulari|ty. Their hearing is interrupted, their
<PB N="16" REF="018896_0015_0FA82B11DC66F730">eyes attracted, their hearts grieved by and for their fellow-wor&s;hippers, and con|&s;equently their attention drawn off, before they are aware, from &s;ubjects upon which they ought and wi&s;hed to have their minds &s;teadily fixed: and thus their &s;ouls are de|prived of much of the plea&s;ure of their mo&s;t important &s;ea&s;ons. In this ca&s;e there|fore, as in all others, &s;hould we take care that we <Q>give no offence to the church of God,</Q> 1 Cor. x. 32. I &s;hall only urge one con&s;ideration more, viz.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Coming late is an affront to the God we wor&s;hip, and the Great Head of the chri&s;|tian church upon who&s;e ordinances we attend.</HI> The God who has in&s;tituted publick wor&s;hip has a&s;&s;ured his people of his pre&s;ence in all places where he records his name. Je&s;us, our exalted Lord, revealed him&s;elf to John af|ter his a&s;cen&s;ion, in the&s;e words, <Q>I am He that walketh in the mid&s;t of the gol|den candle&s;ticks.</Q> Rev. ii. 1. meaning his churches: and when upon earth he &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <Q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them,</Q> Mat. xviii. 20. In the mid&s;t of them, among other purpo&s;es, to in&s;pect their behaviour. But how mu&s;t the conduct of tho&s;e appear to him who betray &s;o much indolence, and
<PB N="17" REF="018896_0016_0FA82B1363962F08">indifference to the honours and privileges of his pre&s;ence as to &s;uffer almo&s;t every trifle to keep them away from his hou&s;e at the hour appointed? Do they not &s;eem afraid of being too long in his pre&s;ence and engaged in his &s;ervice? May he not from hence charge them as he did an ancient people with &s;aying, <Q>It is vain to &s;erve God, and what profit is it if we keep his ordinances?</Q> Mal. iii. 14. Indeed by &s;hortening the hours of divine wor&s;hip they are robbing God, and that in &s;uch a &s;acri|legious manner as mu&s;t certainly be mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ing to him, who&s;e we are, and whom we are bound to &s;erve; be&s;ides, it betrays a degree of irreverence and di&s;re&s;pect to the Maje&s;ty of Heaven that we &s;hould be a&s;hamed of in our conduct towards an earth|ly &s;overeign. Were we invited, with our brethren, at &s;uch an hour, into the royal pre&s;ence, and encouraged to pre&s;ent our petitions before the throne, with a&s;&s;urances of a gracious audience and a merciful an|&s;wer, we &s;hould not, we could not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be later than the time appoint|ed. Nay we &s;ee men of bu&s;ine&s;s e&s;teem it a point of honour to be punctual to their appointments one with another. And I am told that per&s;ons who frequent fa&s;hionable entertainments u&s;ually take care to be in
<PB N="18" REF="018896_0017_0FA82B138E6D7B40">time there, nay that many go half an hour, and &s;ometimes more than an hour, before it begins, rather than lo&s;e any the lea&s;t part of a favourite amu&s;ement. I am &s;orry to have occa&s;ion to call the thoughts of chri&s;tians to the Exchange and the Play-hou&s;e to learn from thence punctuality in their attendance on the hou&s;e of God. I would much ra|ther charge it upon them by the love and e&s;teem they bear for their Creator and Re|deemer, and the pious gratitude they owe for all the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence and Grace be&s;towed upon them; by the reve|rence they profe&s;s for divine in&s;titutions, and by every wi&s;h and de&s;ire they entertain of the pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing of the Mo&s;t High: that pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing of his, to which ordinances owe their efficacy, upon which we depend for the true enjoyment of life in every connection and condition, and which is the joy and glory of heaven. I would hope nothing more need be &s;aid to induce &s;erious chri&s;tians to attend early up|on publick ordinances. But when any are unavoidably late I mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat and exhort them to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible pre|caution in their manner of entering the place and going to their &s;eats, that they may di&s;turb their mini&s;ter and fellow-wor|&s;hippers as little as po&s;&s;ible. Some per&s;ons,
<PB N="19" REF="018896_0018_0FA82B1452489678">by the incautious manner in which they open and &s;hut the doors of the place, hurry to their &s;eats, and run up the &s;tairs into the galleries, add greatly to the nui&s;ance of their irregularity. As this is often ob&s;ervable of young people I mention it that tho&s;e who have the care of them may take proper methods with them to prevent it. Nay I hope that my reader will al&s;o ob&s;erve here, that what has been &s;aid to enforce an early attendance at the hou&s;e of God, may, and ought to be con&s;i|dered as recommending a <HI>reverent and re|&s;pectful behaviour</HI> in it&mdash;as reproving <HI>drow|&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and every mark of <HI>inattention</HI> there&mdash;as evincing the folly and &s;in of <HI>entirely for|&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together,</HI> or <HI>going to publick wor&s;hip only one part of a &s;abbath</HI>&mdash;and as capable of being urged with equal force and propriety again&s;t the practice of <HI>running out before the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P>Every one may and ought to attend upon publick ordinances where they are admini&s;tered in a manner that appears to him mo&s;t agreeable to the word of God, and for his &s;piritual edifica|tion. It is a chri&s;tian's duty to Chri&s;t and his own &s;oul to &s;eek &s;uch a privilege; and, when &s;ecured, whether near or at a di&s;tance,
<PB N="20" REF="018896_0019_0FA82B151F242B00">carefully and thankfully to embrace and improve it. To attend &s;tatedly and regu|larly there. Roving about from place to place, one &s;abbath, or one part of the day, here, and another there, without fixing in any &s;ociety, indi&s;po&s;es men to &s;erve the in|tere&s;t of Chri&s;t any where with &s;pirit and &s;teadine&s;s, un&s;ettles the mind, and, by en|couraging a ta&s;te for novelty, diverts it from the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful ends of hearing. Mini&s;ters cannot well know their hearers, and therefore can neither pray properly for them, nor &s;peak &s;uitable to them, when their congre|gations are thus fluctuating; and though hearers may be &s;ometimes &s;truck with a new voice, language, and manner, they can neither under&s;tand nor retain what they hear from various mini&s;ters &s;o much to their &s;olid and la&s;ting improvement, as from one with who&s;e &s;tyle and method, by long u&s;e, they become familiarly acquainted. A tree often removed bears no fruit.</P>
<P>But I proceed to offer &s;ome directions to render an early and regular attendance up|on publick wor&s;hip ea&s;y and profitable.&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e I &s;hall only ju&s;t mention, and that in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="1">I. Endeavour to get the time for begin|ning publick wor&s;hip fixed and properly ob&s;erved in the place where you attend.
<PB N="21" REF="018896_0020_0FA82B15CD5F37C0">When it is &s;een that the mini&s;ter, and a re&s;|pectable part of the congregation are punc|tual in their attendance, it may be hoped that the good effects of &s;uch a regulation will &s;oon be apparent on the whole.</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to a&s;certain the time exactly, keep your clocks or watches regular; and &s;ee that they be rather too fa&s;t than too &s;low on the Lord's day Morning. Tho&s;e who have neither, may ob&s;erve a &s;un-dial, or &s;ome well regulated clock, in their neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P N="3">III. Ri&s;e early on the Lord's day Morn|ing; e&s;pecially if you are at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the hou&s;e of God, as you de|&s;ire to be in time there, to have opportuni|ties of imploring the divine ble&s;&s;ing, in your retirements and families, upon the &s;ea&s;ons and means of grace with which you are favoured.</P>
<Q><L>"Up, &s;leeper, from thy bed. At earlier hour,</L>
<L>"From &s;adder bed, for thee thy Saviour ro&s;e."</L></Q>
<P N="4">IV. The&s;e who wi&s;h to be both able and di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e at a proper time on the Lord's day, and indeed to be &s;ir, when they are up, for the &s;acred duties of the &s;abbath, &s;hould retire early to bed the evening be|fore; and endeavour to di&s;engage them|&s;elves as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible on the &s;aturday evening from the cares and hurries of bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="22" REF="018896_0021_0FA82B169A06FAA8">and hou&s;hold affairs, that they may have time for tho&s;e devout exerci&s;es which will be preparatory to a more comfortable and profitable attendance upon publick or|dinances on the Lord's day.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let not the precious hours of the Lord's day be &s;pent, either in exce&s;&s;ive or delicate eating, or drinking, or in tho&s;e need|le&s;s ornaments of dre&s;s, by attending to which the cultivation of the mind would be neglected for the &s;ake of that outward adorning of the body, which calls off the attention both of the wearers and &s;pectators from objects infinitely more worthy the no|tice and regard of immortal, yet dying crea|tures, and the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It may be a hint worth attending to by all, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who live at a di&s;|tance, that they would do well to &s;et out in good time from their own hou&s;es, &s;o as to be in their places four or five minutes before publick wor&s;hip begins; that by a &s;hort re&s;t, recollection, and ejaculatory ad|dre&s;s to God, they may be the better pre|pared for the &s;olemn &s;ervice: allowing like|wi&s;e for unexpected hindrances, and varia|tion in clocks. If people only aim at being pre&s;ent ju&s;t at the time of beginning, they will often be too late.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Above all let me intreat my reader
<PB N="23" REF="018896_0022_0FA82B1762A049D0">to cultivate a reverence for ordinances, and for him who has appointed them, together with a governing regard to the important ends of the&s;e &s;acred in&s;titutions. The love of Chri&s;t &s;hed abroad in the heart; that zeal of the hou&s;e of God which ate him up; a lowly fen&s;e of our need of improvement, and a di&s;po&s;ition like the apo&s;tle Paul's, to pre&s;s towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, would not need many arguments to recommend the means of grace, or a regular and dili|gent attendance upon them.</P>
<P>It has been often ob&s;erved, and it is matter of very &s;erious and intere&s;ting con|&s;ideration to us, that &s;ocieties, in this and many other re&s;pects, are as their mini&s;ters. The general turn of a people becomes re|gular, devout, and zealous by attending on the mini&s;trations, and ob&s;erving the &s;pirit and walk of a faithful and active &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, who lives the doctrine he preach|es, and appears, by the fervour of his pray|ers for them, and the a&s;&s;iduity of his la|bours among them, to long after the people of his charge in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a formal, trifling, in|dolent mini&s;ter, who di&s;covers little or no heart for his work, or concern for the &s;ouls committed to his care, &s;preads a &s;pirit of
<PB N="24" REF="018896_0023_0FA82B1808E63E78">formality and lukewarmne&s;s all around him. They &s;ee him indifferent to the pow|er of Godline&s;s in his own heart and life, it appears in the &s;train of his public &s;ervices, and the lifele&s;s manner in which he per|forms them: ob&s;erving him negligent of the rules of good order in the hou&s;e of God, a &s;pirit of indolence and inactivity &s;preads among them, and if they do not expre&s;sly plead his example, it has its &s;e|cret and powerful influence upon them. In the ca&s;e before us, if a mini&s;ter be irre|gular and inaccurate in his time of begin|ning publick wor&s;hip, his people not know|ing when to come will be more &s;o in their attendance: when they have ob&s;erved him half a quarter of an hour too late one day, no wonder if they are a quarter the next.</P>
<P>And, if I might take the liberty of &s;ug|ge&s;ting the farther hint, I would remind my brethren with my&s;elf, that it becomes us to take heed that we do not weary our hearers either by the unrea&s;onable length of our &s;ervices, the unprofitablene&s;s of our matter, or the heavine&s;s of our manner in the performance of them, but endeavour to di&s;mi&s;s them continually under &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions as may tend to make the &s;abbath a delight, and the return of it de&s;irable. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
