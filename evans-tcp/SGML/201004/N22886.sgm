<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;erenity, that reigned in our political hemi&s;phere at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by the boi&s;terous conflict for and again&s;t the treaty with Great Britain. This &s;truggle, the cau&s;e as well as the circum&s;tances of which are too unplea&s;ant to be dwelt on here, ended in the determination of the di&s;comfited party to petition the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and thus renew the fight. Hence mo&s;t peo|ple looked towards the meeting of Congre&s;s with unu&s;ual anxie|ty: every real American had his hopes and his fears; of cour&s;e, I had mine: and, as I look upon it to be the duty of every man to keep the deck during a &s;torm, I re&s;olved to be a punctual at|tendant in the Gallery from one end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the members will, without doubt, recollect &s;eeing a little dark man, clad in a grey coat &s;omething the wor&s;e for wear, &s;itting in the we&s;t corner of the front &s;eat: that has been my po&s;t; and I can boldly &s;ay, that I never de&s;erted it; except during the five days that I was employed in writing the <HI>New Year's Gift.</HI></P>
<P>During this my contemplative attendance, I made a number of remarks, which, becau&s;e they appeared pertinent to me, I naturally imagined would be u&s;eful to my countrymen; and this, together with con&s;iderations of a dome&s;tic nature, tempted me to
<PB N="iv" REF="030229_0005_0FE54D2A90941460">
pre&s;ent them to the public, accompanied with the debates to which they refer.</P>
<P>But, I &s;hould be wanting in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf on this occa|&s;ion, were I to omit mentioning other motives that had a &s;hare in inducing me to undertake the compilation. I had ob&s;erved, with a good deal of pain, that a certain Mr. Callender, amu&s;ed him&s;elf, during one half of the &s;ummer, in re-publi&s;h|ing the debates from the Philadelphia Gazette, with the volumi|nous addition of the minutes of the Hou&s;e. This laborious ta&s;k appeared to me to an&s;wer no earthly purpo&s;e, but that of keeping half a dozen lu&s;ty fellows pent up in the city, at work in ink and filth, to the evident detriment of their health, while they might be &s;o much more whole&s;omely as well as profitably em|ployed in getting in the harve&s;t. It was al&s;o certain, that, while Mr. Callender him&s;elf was this way engaged, he could not apply the whole force of his genius to his other important &s;tudies; and that, &s;hould he be &s;uffered to proceed the en&s;uing &s;ummer, the people of the United States might, perhaps, be de|prived of a <HI>third</HI> "Political Progre&s;s of Britain," foretelling the long-hoped-for ruin of that "in&s;ular Ba&s;tile."</P>
<P>Thus then, in &s;pite of my cruel and implacable per&s;ecutors, the Democrats, from who&s;e malice no degree of inofen&s;ivene&s;s has been able to &s;helter me, I hope the world will be convinced, that this undertaking of mine has been dictated by the pure&s;t patrioti&s;m and urbanity; a circum&s;tance that a&s;&s;uredly does not render it le&s;s worthy of the patronage of my fellow citizens.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TRUST I do not deceive my&s;elf, while I indulge the per&s;ua&s;ion, that I have never met you at any period, when, more than at the pre&s;ent, the &s;ituation of our public affairs has afforded ju&s;t cau&s;e for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the
<PB N="2" REF="030229_0007_0FE54D2C21B6FF28">
Author of all Good, for the numerous and extraordinary ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy.</P>
<P>The termination of the long, expen&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, in which we have been engaged with certain Indians, North We&s;t of the Ohio, is placed in the option of the United States, by a Treaty which the Commander of our army has concluded, provi&s;ionally, with the ho&s;tile tribes in that region. In the adju&s;tment of the terms, the &s;atis|faction of the Indians was deemed an object worthy no le&s;s of the policy, than of the liberality of the United States, as the nece&s;&s;ary ba&s;is of durable tranquility. This object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon, will immediately be laid before the Senate, for their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our Frontiers, have lately con|firmed their pre-exi&s;ting Treaties with us; and were giv|ing evidence of a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to carry them into ef|fect, by the &s;urrender of the pri&s;oners and property they had taken:&mdash;But we have to lament, that the fair pro&s;pect in this quarter, has been once more clouded by wanton murders, which &s;ome citizens of Georgia are repre&s;ented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks; which have again &s;ubjected that frontier to di&s;|quietude and danger; which will be productive of further expence, and may occa&s;ion more effu&s;ion of blood. Mea|&s;ures are pur&s;uing to prevent or mitigate the u&s;ual con&s;e|quences of &s;uch outrages; and with the hope of their &s;uc|ceeding&mdash;at lea&s;t to avert general ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>A letter from the Emperor of Morocco, announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father, the late Emperor, and con&s;equently the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar &s;atisfaction I add, that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers, importing, that the terms of a treaty with the Dey and Regency of that country, had been ad|ju&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, as to authorize the expectation of a &s;peedy peace, and the re&s;toration of our unfortunate fel|low citizens from a grievous captivity.</P>
<P>The late&s;t advices from our envoy at the court of Ma|drid, give, moreover, the plea&s;ing information, that he had received a&s;&s;urances of a &s;peedy and &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion of his negociation. While the event, depend|ing upon unadju&s;ted particulars, cannot be regarded as a&s;|certained,
<PB REF="030229_0008_0FE54D05D34A4738">
it is agreeable to cheri&s;h the expectation of an i&s;&s;ue, which, &s;ecuring amicably very e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the United States, will, at the &s;ame time, lay the foun|dation of la&s;ting harmony with a power, who&s;e friend&s;hip we have uniformly and &s;incerely de&s;ired to cultivate.</P>
<P>Though not before officially di&s;clo&s;ed to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprized, that a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, has been nego|ciated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have advi&s;|ed and con&s;ented to its ratification, upon a condition, which excepts part of one article.&mdash;Agreeably thereto, and to the be&s;t judgment I was able to form of the public intere&s;t, after full and mature deliberation, I have added my &s;anc|tion. The re&s;ult on the part of his Britannic Maje&s;ty is unknown. When received, the &s;ubject will, without de|lay, be placed before Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ting &s;ummary of our affairs, with regard to the foreign powers, between whom and the United States, controver&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and with regard al&s;o to tho&s;e of our Indian neighbours, with whom, we have been in a &s;tate of enmity or mi&s;under&s;tanding, opens a wide field for con&s;oling and gratifying reflections.&mdash;If by prudence and moderation on every &s;ide, the extingui&s;hment of all the cau&s;es of external di&s;cord, which have heretofore me|naced our tranquility, on terms compatible with our na|tional rights and honour, &s;hall be the happy re&s;ult; how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating, maturing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the pro&s;perity of our country!</P>
<P>Contemplating the internal &s;ituation, as well as the external relations of the United States, we di&s;cover e|qual cau&s;e for contentment and &s;atisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American depen|dencies, have been involved in a conte&s;t unu&s;ually bloody, exhau&s;ting and calamitous, in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by dome&s;tic convul&s;ion and in|&s;urrection; in which many of the arts mo&s;t u&s;eful to &s;oci|ety, have been expo&s;ed to di&s;couragement and decay; in which &s;carcity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence has embittered other &s;ufferings &mdash;while even the anticipation of a return of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and repo&s;e, are alloyed by the &s;en&s;e of heavy and accumulating burthens, which pre&s;s upon all the depart|ments of indu&s;try, and threaten to clog the future &s;prings of government&mdash;our favoured country, happy in a &s;triking
<PB N="4" REF="030229_0009_0FE54D2DB951DFB8">
contra&s;t, has enjoyed general tranquility; a tranquility the more &s;atisfactory, becau&s;e maintained at the expence of no duty.&mdash;Faithful to our&s;elves, we have violated no obliga|tion to others.&mdash;Our agriculture, commerce and manufac|tures pro&s;per beyond former example; the mole&s;tations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remon&s;trances have been made) being overba|lanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral po&s;ition. Our population advances with a celerity, which, exceeding the mo&s;t &s;anguine calculations, propor|tionally augments our &s;trength and re&s;ources, and guaran|tees our future &s;ecurity. Every part of the Union di&s;plays indications of rapid and various improvement, and with burthens &s;o light as &s;carcely to be perceived; with re&s;ources fully adequate to our pre&s;ent exigencies; with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty; and with mild and whole&s;ome laws; is it too much to &s;ay, that our country exhibits a &s;pectacle of national happine&s;s never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, if ever before equalled?</P>
<P>Placed in a &s;ituation every way au&s;picious, motives of commanding force impel us, with &s;incere acknowledge|ment to Heaven, and pure love to our country, to unite our efforts to pre&s;erve, prolong and improve our immen&s;e advantages.&mdash;To co-operate with you in this de&s;irable work, is a fervent and favourite wi&s;h of my heart.</P>
<P>It is a valuable ingredient in the general e&s;timate of our welfare, that the part of our country which was lately the &s;cene of di&s;order and in&s;urrection, now enjoys the ble&s;|&s;ings of quiet and order. The mi&s;led have abandoned their errors, and pay the re&s;pect to our con&s;titution and laws, which is due from good citizens to the public autho|rities of the &s;ociety. The&s;e circum&s;tances have induced me to pardon, generally, the offenders here referred to; and to extend forgivene&s;s to tho&s;e who had been adjudged to capital puni&s;hment.&mdash;For though I &s;hall always think it a &s;acred duty to exerci&s;e with firmne&s;s and energy, the con|&s;titutional powers with which I am ve&s;ted; yet it appears to me no le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the public good, than it is with my per&s;onal feelings, to mingle in the operations of government, every degree of moderation and tenderne&s;s, which the national ju&s;tice, dignity and &s;afety may permit.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Among the objects which will claim your attention in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a review of our military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="5" REF="030229_0010_0FE54D349C669D58">
is not the lea&s;t important. It is called for by the e|vents which have changed, and may be expected &s;till further to change the relative &s;ituation of our frontiers. In this review, you will doubtle&s;s allow due weight to the con&s;i|derations, that the que&s;tions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adju&s;ted; that the war in Europe is not yet terminated; and that our we&s;tern po&s;ts, when recovered, will demand provi&s;ion for garri&s;oning and &s;e|curing them. A &s;tatement of our pre&s;ent military force will be laid before you by the department of war.</P>
<P>With the review of our army e&s;tabli&s;hment, is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit enquiry, what imperfections in the exi&s;ting plan, further experience may have unfolded. The &s;ubject is of &s;o much moment, in my e&s;timation, as to excite a con&s;tant &s;olicitude, that the con&s;i|deration of it may be renewed, till the greate&s;t attainable perfection &s;hall be accompli&s;hed. Time is wearing away &s;ome advantages for forwarding the object, while none better de&s;erves the per&s;evering attention of the public coun|cils.</P>
<P>While we indulge the &s;atisfaction, which the actual condition of our we&s;tern borders &s;o well authorizes, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould not lo&s;e &s;ight of an important truth, which continually receives new confirmations,&mdash;name|ly, that the provi&s;ions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawle&s;s part of our frontier inhabitants, are in&s;ufficient. It is demon|&s;trated that the&s;e violences can now be perpetrated with im|punity. And it can need no argument to prove, that unle&s;s the murdering of Indians can be re&s;trained, by bringing the mur|derers to condign puni&s;hment, all the exertions of the govern|ment to prevent de&s;tructive retaliations by the Indians, will prove fruitle&s;s, and all our pre&s;ent agreeable pro&s;pects illu|&s;ory. The frequent de&s;truction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, mu&s;t continue to &s;hock humanity; and an enormous expence, to drain the trea&s;ury of the Union.</P>
<P>To enforce upon the Indians the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice, it is indi&s;pen&s;able that there &s;hall be competent means of rendering ju&s;tice to them. If the&s;e means can be devi&s;ed by the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s; and e&s;pecially if there can be added an adequate provi&s;ion for &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of the Indians, on rea&s;onable terms, (a mea&s;ure, the men|tion
<PB N="6" REF="030229_0011_0FE54D39E41CA4E8">
of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the con|ferences with them, they urge it with &s;olicitude) I &s;hould not he&s;itate to entertain a &s;trong hope of rendering our tranquility permanent. I add, with plea&s;ure, that the probability even of their civilization, is not dimini&s;hed by the experiments which have been thus far made, under the au&s;pices of government.&mdash;The accompli&s;hment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying lu&s;tre on our national character, and admini&s;ter the mo&s;t grateful con&s;olations that virtuous minds can know.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tate of our revenue with the &s;ums which have been borrowed and re-imbur&s;ed, pur&s;uant to different acts of Congre&s;s, will be &s;ubmitted from the proper depart|ments; together with an e&s;timate of the appropriations ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be made for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year.</P>
<P>Whether mea&s;ures may not be advi&s;eable to reinforce the provi&s;ion for the redemption of the public debt, will na|turally engage your examination.&mdash;Congre&s;s have demon|&s;trated their &s;en&s;e to be, and it were &s;uperfluous to repeat mine, that what&s;oever will tend to accelerate the honour|able extinction of our public debt, accords as much with the true intere&s;t of our country, as with the general &s;en&s;e of our con&s;tituents.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tatements which will be laid before you relative to the mint, will &s;hew the &s;ituation of that in&s;titution; and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome further legi&s;lative provi&s;ions, for car|rying the bu&s;ine&s;s of it more completely into effect; and for checking abu&s;es which appear to be ari&s;ing in particu|lar quarters.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s in providing materials for the frigates, and in building them; the &s;tate of the fortifications of our harbours; the mea&s;ures which have been pur&s;ued for ob|taining proper &s;cites for ar&s;enals, and for repleni&s;hing our magazines with military &s;tores; and the &s;teps which have been taken towards the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians; will likewi&s;e be pre&s;ented for the information of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Temperate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the important &s;ubjects which may ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and mutual forbear|ance where there is a difference of opinion, are too obvi|ous
<PB N="7" REF="030229_0012_0FE54D3B76B50910">
and nece&s;&s;ary for the peace, happine&s;s and welfare of our Country, to need any recommendation of mine.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Pre&s;ident arrived at the Hou&s;e this day, he found it in that &s;tate of compo&s;ed gravity, of re&s;pectful &s;ilence, for which the Congre&s;s is &s;o remarkable, and which, whatever witlings may &s;ay, is the &s;ure&s;t mark of &s;ound under&s;tanding.&mdash; The gallery was crowded with anxious &s;pectators, who&s;e orderly behaviour was not the lea&s;t plea&s;ing part of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident is a timid &s;peaker: he is a proof, among thou&s;ands, that &s;uperior genius, wi&s;dom, and courage, are ever accompanied with exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation was at this time almo&s;t entirely new. Never, till a few months preceding this &s;e&s;|&s;ion, had the tongue of the mo&s;t factious &s;lander dared to make a public attack on his character. This was the fir&s;t time he had ever entered the walls of Congre&s;s without a full a&s;&s;urance of meeting a welcome from every heart. He now &s;aw, even a|mong tho&s;e to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, numbers who, to repay all his labours, all his anxious cares for their welfare, were ready to thwart his mea&s;ures, and pre&s;ent him the cup of humiliation, filled to the brim. When he came to that part of his &s;peech, where he mentions the treaty with His Britannic Maje&s;ty, he ca&s;t his eyes towards the gallery.&mdash;It was not the look of indignation and reproach, but of injured virtue, which is ever ready to forgive. I was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that not a &s;ingle murmur of di&s;approbation was heard from the &s;pectators that &s;urrounded me; and, if there were &s;ome a|mong&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="030229_0013_0FE54D3D0AD8DB00">
them, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the turbulent town-meetings. I am per&s;uaded, they were &s;incere|ly penitent. When he departed, every look &s;eemed to &s;ay: God prolong his precious life.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="debate">
<P>THE addre&s;s in an&s;wer to the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech was ta|ken up by paragraphs.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t clau&s;es but one, which are as follows, were moved to be &s;truck out by Mr. Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting pro&s;pect of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers, between whom and the United States con|trover&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, is not more &s;atisfactory than the review of our internal &s;ituation; if from the former we de|rive an expectation of the extingui&s;hment of all the cau&s;es of external di&s;cord that have heretofore endangered our tranquility, and on terms con&s;i&s;tent with our national ho|nour and &s;afety, in the latter we di&s;cover tho&s;e numerous and wide &s;pread tokens of pro&s;perity, which in &s;o peculiar a manner di&s;tingui&s;h our happy country.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances thus every way au&s;picious demand our gratitude and &s;incere acknowledgements to Almighty God, and require that we &s;hould unite our efforts in imitation of your enlightened example, to e&s;tabli&s;h and pre&s;erve the peace, freedom, and pro&s;perity of our country.</P>
<P>Mr. MASON ob&s;erved, that he had hoped, nothing con|tained in the addre&s;s reported as an an&s;wer to the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, would have been &s;uch as to force the Senate to precipitate deci&s;ions. The two clau&s;es he objected to di&s;|appointed him in that hope. They were calculated to bring again into view the important &s;ubject which occupied the Senate during their June &s;e&s;&s;ion. This he conceived would an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e; the minority on that oc|ca&s;ion were not now to be expected to recede, from the o|pinion
<PB N="9" REF="030229_0014_0FE54D0EB7EC3D08">
they then held, and they could not therefore join in the indirect &s;elf-approbation which the majority appear|ed to wi&s;h for, and which was mo&s;t certainly involved in the two clau&s;es which he hoped would be &s;truck out. If his motion were agreed to, the remainder of the addre&s;s would in his opinion &s;tand unexceptionable. He did not &s;ee, for his part, that our &s;ituation is every way au&s;picious. Notwith&s;tanding the treaty, our trade is grievou&s;ly mo|le&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mr. KING ob&s;erved, that the principal features ob&s;erva|ble in the an&s;wer reported to the Pre&s;ident's addre&s;s, were, to keep up that harmony of intercour&s;e which ought to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between the legi&s;lature and the Pre&s;ident, and to expre&s;s confidence in the undimini&s;hed firmne&s;s and love of coun|try which always characteri&s;e our chief executive magi&s;|trate. He objected to &s;triking out e&s;pecially the fir&s;t clau&s;e, becau&s;e founded on undeniable truth. It only declares, that our pro&s;pects, as to our external relations, are not more &s;atisfactory, than a review of our internal &s;ituation would prove. Was not this repre&s;entation true, he a&s;k|ed; could it be controverted? This clau&s;e, he contended, contained nothing rea&s;onably objectionable; it did not &s;ay as much as the &s;econd, to which only mo&s;t of the objec|tions of the member up before him applied, an an&s;wer to which he &s;hould defer, expecting that a que&s;tion would be put on each in order.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e, he &s;aid, appeared to him drawn up in &s;uch terms as could not offend the nice&s;t feelings of the minority on the important deci&s;ion in June; it was particularly cir|cum&s;pect and cautious. If liable to objection it was in not going as far as the truth would warrant.</P>
<P>Some conver&s;ation took place as to the mode required by order of putting the que&s;tion; whether it &s;hould not be put on each clau&s;e &s;eparately, or whether upon &s;triking out both at once.</P>
<P>The chair reque&s;ted that the motion &s;hould be reduced to writing. Mr. Ma&s;on accordingly reduced it to writing, and it went to &s;triking out both clau&s;es at once.</P>
<P>Mr. MASON agreed mo&s;t cordially that the &s;ituation of our external relations were not more a cau&s;e of joy than our &s;ituation at home. But the obvious meaning of the clau&s;e he conceived was an indirect approval of our &s;ituation re|lative to external concerns; and to this he could not give
<PB N="10" REF="030229_0015_0FE54D4438CE05D0">
his a&s;&s;ent, as he did not con&s;ider their a&s;pect as pro&s;perous or au&s;picious.</P>
<P>Mr. BUTLER &s;aid, that when the committee was appoint|ed to draft an an&s;wer, he hoped they would have u&s;ed &s;uch general terms as to have &s;ecured an unanimous vote. He was willing to give the chief magi&s;trate &s;uch an an&s;wer, as re&s;pect to his &s;tation entitled him to, but not &s;uch a one as would do violence to his regard for the con&s;titution and his duty to his con&s;tituents. He could not approve of long and detailed an&s;wers, however unexceptionable the &s;peech might be in matter, and however re&s;pectable the character might be from whom it came. He had hopod, from the peculiar &s;ituation of the country, and of the Senate, that nothing would have been brought forward in the an&s;wer on the &s;ubject which agitated the June executive &s;e&s;&s;ion, calculated to wound the feelings of members. He had been di&s;appointed; it was evident, that &s;ome members of the Senate could not give their vote in favour of the addre&s;s in its pre&s;ent &s;hape, without involving them&s;elves in the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>He had long &s;ince for his own part, declared him&s;elf a|gain&s;t every article of the treaty, becau&s;e in no in&s;tance as it bottomed on reciprocity, the only honourable ba&s;is. Af|ter this declaration, how could he, or tho&s;e who coincided in opinion with him, agree to the pre&s;ent addre&s;s without involving them&s;elves in the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>He did not agree with the gentlemen of New-York in his expo&s;ition of the meaning of the clau&s;es objected to. They certainly declare our &s;ituation as to our external rela|tions to be favourable. Our &s;ituation as far as it re&s;pects Great Britain, he contended was not in the lea&s;t amelio|rated.&mdash;Their depredations on our commerce have not been le&s;s frequent of late than at any other period &s;ince the be|ginning of her war with France. Her orders for the &s;eiz|ure of all our ve&s;&s;els laden with provi&s;ions cannot &s;urely be a &s;ubject for congratulation. When it became authenti|cated that our trade was relieved from the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, then he was confident members of Senate, who were with him in &s;entiment, would readily expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction at the au&s;picious pro&s;pect, opened for this country to the en|joyments of tranquility and happine&s;s. But until that happy time &s;hould arrive, he could not give his voice to deceive the inhabitants of the United States, remote from the &s;ources of information, to hoodwink them by &s;anction|ing
<PB N="11" REF="030229_0016_0FE54D45D7A53900">
with his vote a &s;tatement unwarranted by truth, and pre&s;enting to them a picture of public happine&s;s not &s;anc|tioned by fact.</P>
<P>The &s;entence objected to, notwith&s;tanding the explana|tion of the gentleman from New-York, appeared to him &s;o worded as to lead the citizens at large to believe, that the &s;poliations on our commerce were drawing to a fortunate clo&s;e. This was not, he conceived, warranted by the ex|i&s;ting &s;tate of things. Indeed he prote&s;ted, he knew no more of the actual &s;ituation of the treaty negociation, than the remote&s;t farmer in the union, could he then declare, he a&s;ked, that it was drawing to a happy clo&s;e. Indeed from the late&s;t information received, far from our &s;ituation having been ameliorated by the negociation of our execu|tive, he conceived our trade as much in jeopardy as ever.</P>
<P>As to the internal pro&s;perity, he owned there was &s;ome cau&s;e for congratulation; but even in this his conviction could not carry him as far as the clau&s;es in the addre&s;s &s;eem|ed to go. In a pecuniary point of view, the country had made a vi&s;ible progre&s;s; but he &s;aw in it no ba&s;is of per|manent pro&s;perity. There were no circum&s;tances attend|ant on it, that gave a fair hope that the pro&s;perity would be permanent. The chief cau&s;e of our temporary pecuniary pro&s;perity is the war in Europe, which occa&s;ions the high prices our produce at pre&s;ent commands, when that is ter|minated, tho&s;e advantageous prices will of cour&s;e fall.</P>
<P>Mr. BUTLER came now to &s;peak of the &s;econd objection|able clau&s;e. He regretted whenever a que&s;tion was brought forward that involved per&s;onality in the mo&s;t indirect man|ner. He wi&s;hed always to &s;peak to &s;ubjects unconnected with men; but the wording of the clau&s;e was unfortunate|ly &s;uch as to render allu&s;ion to official character unavoida|ble. He objected principally to the epithet <HI>firm</HI> introdu|ced in the latter clau&s;e as applied to the &s;upreme executive. Why <HI>firmne&s;s?</HI> he a&s;ked. To what? or to whom? Is it the <HI>manly</HI> demand of re&s;titution made of Great Britain for her accumulated injuries, that called forth the prai&s;e; for his own part he could di&s;cern no firmne&s;s there. Is it for the <HI>undaunted</HI> and <HI>energetic</HI> countenance of the cau&s;e of France, in her &s;truggle for freeing her&s;elf from de&s;potic &s;hackles? He &s;aw no <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> di&s;played on that occa&s;ion. Where then is it to be found? Was it in the oppo&s;ition of the minority of the Senate and the general voice of the people again&s;t the treaty that that <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> was di&s;played?
<PB N="12" REF="030229_0017_0FE54D47680AA410">
<Q>If it is, that <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> in oppo&s;ing the will of the people, which is intended to be extolled, the vote &s;hall never, &s;aid Mr. Butler, "leave the walls of this Senate with <HI>my</HI> approbation.</Q></P>
<P>He could not approve, he &s;aid, that <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> that prompt|ed the executive to re&s;i&s;t the unequivocal voice of his fel|low-citizens from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia. He would have applauded the firmne&s;s of the Pre&s;ident, if in compli|ance with the unequivocal wi&s;h of the people he had re|&s;i&s;ted the voice of the majority on the treaty, and refu&s;ed his &s;ignature to the treaty.</P>
<P>This was, he under&s;tood (and it &s;hould be mentioned to the honour of the Pre&s;ident) his fir&s;t intention&mdash;Why he changed it, time, he &s;aid, mu&s;t di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>He concluded by propo&s;ing an amendment to be &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in lieu of the objectional clau&s;es, &s;hould they be &s;truck out.</P>
<P>Mr. READ &s;aid, he was not in the habit of giving a &s;i|lent vote, and as many of his con&s;tituents were aver&s;e to the in&s;trument to which he had given his a&s;&s;ent, he thought this a fit opportunity to &s;ay &s;omething on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Gentlemen on the other &s;ide had &s;poken of their feel|ings; did they &s;uppo&s;e, he a&s;ked, that tho&s;e who were in the majority had not feelings. Al&s;o, gentlemen declared, they would not recede from their former determinations; did they expect that the majority would recede?</P>
<P>He had, he &s;aid, taken the que&s;tion of the treaty in all its a&s;pects, and con&s;idered it maturely, and though he la|mented that he differed in opinion on that &s;ubject with his colleague and a portion of the people of his &s;tate, he ne|verthele&s;s remained convinced that the ratification of it was advi&s;eable: it re&s;cued the country from war and its de&s;ola|ting horrors.</P>
<P>After reading that part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech to which the clau&s;es objected to were an echo, he a&s;ked, whether any one could &s;ay, under the conviction that the mea&s;ures of government had prevented a war, that a view of our fo|reign relations was not con&s;olatory. On all hands, he ob|&s;erved, the idea of a war was deprecated, both &s;ides of the hou&s;e wi&s;hed to avoid it, then is it not a con&s;olatory reflec|tion to all that its horrors have been averted. Is there a man, who does not believe that had the treaty not been ra|tified we &s;hould have had war? If the country had been plunged into a war would it be as flouri&s;hing as it is? The
<PB N="17" REF="030229_0018_0FE54D4B7004B1B0">
trifling vexations our commerce has &s;u&s;tained are not to be compared to the evils of a &s;tate of ho&s;tility. What good end could have been an&s;wered by a war?&mdash;the addre&s;s in the part under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;ays no more, than that we rejoice at the pro&s;pect that the ble&s;&s;ings of peace will be pre&s;erv|ed; and does not this expectation exi&s;t?</P>
<P>Great Britain in the plentitude of her power had avail|ed her&s;elf of the right &s;he had under the law of nations, of &s;eizing enemies' goods in neutral ve&s;&s;els; but has allowed compen&s;ation to &s;ome Americans, and a &s;y&s;tem of mild mea&s;ures on our part is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for further.</P>
<P>He adverted to that part of Mr. Butler's ob&s;ervations, which related to the probable fall of provi&s;ions at the peace. We ought not to be grieved if Europe was rid of the cala|mities of war at that price. But he contended, that from the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration permanent advantages were &s;ecured to this country. The value of our &s;oil has been enhanced; wealth has poured in from various parts of the globe, and many permanent advantages &s;ecured.</P>
<P>There had been one a&s;&s;ertion made, which by repetition had by &s;ome almo&s;t been taken for granted, but which re|quired proof to induce him to believe it, and that was, that a majority of the citizens of the United States are oppo&s;ed to the treaty. In the part of the country he came from he owned there might be a majority of that opinion, but he believed the contrary of the United States at large; he expre&s;&s;ed a conviction, that when his con&s;tituents came to con&s;ider the mea&s;ure maturely they would change their opinions; and, indeed, under&s;tood that the fal&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions by which they were at fir&s;t actuated were already wearing off.</P>
<P>But the Senate and Pre&s;ident are the con&s;titutional trea|ty making powers. If mi&s;taken in their deci&s;ions, they cannot be accu&s;ed of having been mi&s;led by &s;udden and im|mature impre&s;&s;ions. He &s;hould conceive him&s;elf unfit to fill a chair in Senate if he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be carried a|way by &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions. The People could not in their town meetings, deprived of proper information, po&s;&s;ibly form an opinion that de&s;erved weight, and it was the duty of the executive not to be &s;haken in their determination by tumultuous proceedings from without. Upon this ground he much approved the Pre&s;ident's conduct and thought it entitled to the epithet <HI>firm.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030229_0019_0FE54D4F6742A0F0">In local que&s;tions, affecting none but the intere&s;ts of his con&s;tituents, he &s;hould attend to their voice, but on great national points he did not con&s;ider him&s;elf as a repre&s;enta|tive from South Carolina, but as &s;enator for the Union. In que&s;tions of this la&s;t kind, even if the wi&s;hes of his con|&s;tituents were unequivocally made known to him, he &s;hould not conceive him&s;elf bound to &s;acrifice his opinions to theirs.&mdash;He viewed the Pre&s;ident as &s;tanding in this &s;itua|tion, and though he might hear the opinions of the people from every part of the United States, he &s;hould not &s;acri|fice to them his own conviction; in this line of conduct he has &s;hewn his <HI>firmne&s;s,</HI> and de&s;erves to be complimented for it by the &s;enate.</P>
<P>The addre&s;s reported, he &s;aid, contained nothing that would wound the feelings of any member. The &s;enate would not, in his opinion, act improperly if they expre&s;|&s;ed opinions in coincidence with their act in June &s;e&s;&s;ion. The feelings of the majority &s;hould be as much con&s;ulted as tho&s;e of the minority. The minority are not a&s;ked to retract; but there is a propriety in the &s;enate's going as far in their addre&s;s as the &s;peech went, though it &s;hould be &s;tiled a vote of &s;elf-approbation. He hoped the clau&s;es would not be &s;truck out.</P>
<P>Mr. ELLSWORTH was oppo&s;ed to &s;triking out. The clau&s;e records a fact, and if &s;truck out the &s;enate deny it. The Pre&s;ident a&s;&s;erts it, in the addre&s;s reported, &s;enate a&s;|&s;ent, a motion is made to &s;trike out, is it becau&s;e the truth of it is doubted? It cannot be called an unimportant fact, therefore its omi&s;&s;ion will not be imputed to over&s;ight. The latter part of the clau&s;e expre&s;&s;es our gratitude to Almighty God. Will the &s;enate refu&s;e to make an acknowledg|ment of that kind? Do they not admit that he is the &s;ource of all good, and can they refu&s;e to acknowledge it? And if &s;o, is it po&s;&s;ible that in admitting the fact and expre&s;&s;ing the &s;entiment which &s;o naturally flows from it, the &s;enate would wound the feelings of any friend to his country?</P>
<P>The truth of the fact is as clear as that the &s;un now &s;hines, the &s;entiment is unexceptionable, he therefore re|commended to his friend the mover not to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;trik|ing out merely but that he &s;hould vary the motion and pro|po&s;e a &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>To bring the mind to the point with preci&s;ion, it was nece&s;&s;ary to attend to the wording of the clau&s;e. He read it. As to the &s;ignification of that part which relates to our
<PB N="19" REF="030229_0020_0FE54D51E28864A0">
foreign concerns, he did not con&s;ider it as hypothetical, but a po&s;itive declaration of a conviction that their &s;ituation is &s;atisfactory, and on that ground he wi&s;hed to meet the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e objected to expre&s;&s;es an expectation that the cau&s;es of external di&s;agreement which have unhappily ex|i&s;ted will be peaceably done away. He &s;aid he had that expectation; many have it not. Tho&s;e who have it not will negative the clau&s;e, tho&s;e who have it will vote in its fa|vour, the re&s;ult will be the &s;en&s;e of a majority; the &s;enate could not be expected, more than on other occa&s;ions to be unanimous: If the declarations contained in tho&s;e clau&s;es are &s;upported, they will be con&s;idered as the &s;en&s;e of the majority of &s;enate, others may di&s;&s;ent; but becau&s;e una|nimity could not be obtained it was no rea&s;on why the ma|jority &s;hould give a virtual negative to the declaration which they conceived founded on truth.</P>
<P>He examined in detail the &s;ituation of our external rela|tions to &s;hew the foundation on which he re&s;ted his ex|pectation of a &s;atisfactory arrangement of them, and of our general pro&s;perity in that re&s;pect. With Morocco our treaties are renewed. With Algiers a&s;&s;urances are given by the Executive that a peace is not far di&s;tant. With Spain on the &s;ame authority it is under&s;tood, that our pro&s;pects are favourable in that quarter; with the hitherto ho&s;tile Indians, a peace is within reach, and the only quarter in which doubt can ari&s;e is from Great Britain. But even with re&s;pect to that nation his expectation was, that our differences there would terminate amicably; and he believed this to be the expectation of the &s;enate, as a collective body.</P>
<P>Mr. ELLSWORTH then went into the examination of &s;ome other parts of the clau&s;es objected to, and vindicated the propriety of the epithets <HI>enlightened, firm, per&s;evering,</HI> and concluded by lamenting that there exi&s;ted a difference of o|pinion; but hoped that this would not deter the majority from an expre&s;&s;ion of their &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. TAZEWELL &s;aid,&mdash;The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion had taken a turn different from that which he expected when he heard the motion. He under&s;tood the motion at the time it was made, and &s;till &s;o under&s;tood it, as not intending to que&s;tion the propriety of any thing which was contained in the Pre&s;i|dent's commmunication to both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s. But from what had been &s;aid, (by Mr. Read of S. C.) that part of the an&s;wer to the Pre&s;ident's communications which had
<PB N="20" REF="030229_0021_0FE54D541924B8C8">
given ri&s;e to the motion, was intended to have a further operation than he originally believed. He a&s;ked what had given ri&s;e to the practice of returning an an&s;wer of any kind to the Pre&s;ident's communications to Congre&s;s in the form of an addre&s;s. There was nothing he &s;aid, in the con&s;titution, or in any of the fundamental rules of the Fe|deral government which required that ceremony from ei|ther branch of the Congre&s;s. The practice was but an imitation of the ceremonies u&s;ed upon like occa&s;ions in o|ther countries, and was neither required by the con&s;titution or authorized by the principles upon which our govern|ment was erected.&mdash;But having obtained, he did not intend now to di&s;turb it.&mdash;To allow the utmo&s;t latitude to the principle which had begotten the practice, it could only tolerate the ceremony as a compliment to the Chief Magi&s;|trate. It could not be permitted to fore&s;tall opinions pre|vious to regular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, nor to operate as a mean of pledging members to the pur&s;uit of a particular cour&s;e which &s;ub&s;equent and more full inquiries might &s;hew to be extremely improper.</P>
<P>Every an&s;wer, therefore, to the Pre&s;ident's communica|tions ought to be drawn in terms extremely general, nei|ther &s;educing the Pre&s;ident into a belief that this Hou&s;e would pur&s;ue a general recommendation into points not at fir&s;t contemplated by them, nor pledging them&s;elves to the world that that &s;tate of things was ju&s;t which time had not permitted them thoroughly to examine. The clau&s;es now under con&s;ideration had at lea&s;t in one in&s;tance deviated from this principle. They declare to the world&mdash;"That the intere&s;ting pro&s;pect of our affairs with regard to the fo|reign powers, between whom, and the United States con|trover&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, is not more &s;atisfactory than the review of our internal &s;ituation." The communications from the Pre&s;ident have not uttered &s;o bold a &s;entiment, nor is there any thing in tho&s;e communications that ju&s;tifies the a&s;&s;ertion of this fact: Placing the treaty with Great Britain out of the que&s;tion, which &s;eems to have been the uppermo&s;t con&s;ideration when this &s;entence was penned, the &s;eizure of our provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els &s;ince the &s;ignature of that treaty and the unwarrantable impri&s;onment of our &s;ea|men are acts which cloud our pro&s;perity and happine&s;s. The minds of the Americans mu&s;t be brought to con&s;ider the&s;e things as trivial incidents in our political affairs, be|fore the &s;entence under con&s;ideration can be approved. He
<PB N="21" REF="030229_0022_0FE54D56763FF468">
&s;aid he mu&s;t therefore vote for the motion to &s;trike out the two clau&s;es of the an&s;wer in order that &s;ome fit expre&s;&s;ions might then be introduced to &s;ucceed them. He hoped the an&s;wer might be couched in terms ju&s;t and delicate to|wards the Pre&s;ident without wounding the feelings of any Senator; and he believed both might be done without any difficulty after the two clau&s;es were expunged.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADDRESS. TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with peculiar &s;atisfaction that we are informed by your Speech to the two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, that the long and expen&s;ive war in which we have been engaged with the Indians north we&s;t of the Ohio, is in a &s;ituation to be finally terminated; and though we view with concern the danger of an interruption of the peace &s;o recently confirmed with the Creeks, we indulge the hope, that the mea&s;ures that you have adopted to prevent the &s;ame, if followed by tho&s;e legi&s;lative provi&s;ions that ju&s;tice and humanity equally de|mand, will &s;ucceed in laying the foundation of a la&s;ting
<PB N="22" REF="030229_0023_0FE54D5A9165B858">
peace with the Indian tribes on the Southern as well as on the We&s;tern Frontiers.</P>
<P>The confirmation of our treaty with Morocco, and the adju&s;tment of a treaty of peace with Algiers, in con&s;e|quence of which our captive fellow citizens &s;hall be deli|vered from &s;lavery, are events that will prove no le&s;s inte|re&s;ting to the public humanity, than they will be import|ant in extending and &s;ecuring the navigation and com|merce of our country.</P>

<P>The intere&s;ting pro&s;pect of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers, between whom and the United States controver&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, is not more &s;atisfactory, than the review of our internal &s;ituation; if from the former we derive an expectation of the extingui&s;hment of all the cau&s;es of external di&s;cord, that have heretofore endanger|ed our tranquility, and on terms con&s;i&s;tent with our na|tional honour and &s;afety, in the latter we di&s;cover tho&s;e numerous and wide &s;pread tokens of pro&s;perity, which in &s;o peculiar a manner di&s;tingui&s;h our happy country.</P>

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE MANNER OF PRESENTING THE ADDRESS IN ANSWER TO THE PRE|SIDENT's SPEECH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>WEDNESDAY, 9th <HI>December,</HI> 1795.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives went into a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, on the &s;peech of the Pre&s;ident, Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair. The clerk then read the &s;peech.</P>
<P>Mr. VANS MURRAY <HI>(Maryland)</HI> next moved that a com|mittee &s;hould be appointed to draw up a re&s;pectful addre&s;s in an&s;wer to the &s;peech. The re&s;olution was in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that a re&s;pectful Addre&s;s ought to be pre&s;ented by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, in an&s;wer to his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, at the commencement of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, containing a&s;&s;urances, that this Hou&s;e will take into con&s;ideration the various and im|portant matters recommended to their attention.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK <HI>(Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts)</HI> &s;econded the motion.</P>
<P>Mr. PARKER <HI>(Virginia)</HI> offered an amendment, which was &s;econded by Mr. Macon (N. C.)</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="030229_0025_0FE54D5DCC296F10">The &s;ub&s;tance of this amendment was to &s;trike out all that part of the re&s;olution which goes before the word <HI>a&s;|&s;urances;</HI> in place of which Mr. Parker propo&s;ed to appoint a committee, who &s;hould per&s;onally wait on the Pre&s;ident, and a&s;&s;ure him of the attention of the Hou&s;e, &amp;c. and con|cluding as above. Mr. Parker had the highe&s;t re&s;pect for the Pre&s;ident, but he had always di&s;approved of this prac|tice of making out addre&s;&s;es in an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;peeches, and of the Hou&s;e leaving their bu&s;ine&s;s to go in a body to pre&s;ent it. La&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion the framing of this addre&s;s had co&s;t very long debates, and produced very great irritation. Some of the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable things that happened, dur|ing the &s;e&s;&s;ion, occurred in the&s;e debates. He wi&s;hed una|nimity, and the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o could not con&s;ent that any addre&s;s &s;hould be drawn up, as he prefer|red ending the affair at once by &s;ending a committee with verbal an&s;wer.</P>
<P>MR. MURRAY replied, that the practice of drawing up &s;uch an addre&s;s was coeval with the con&s;titution. It was con&s;i&s;tent with good &s;en&s;e, and he did not &s;ee that any ar|guments had been employed by the gentlemen who &s;poke la&s;t again&s;t it. It was true that the Hou&s;e might &s;end a verbal an&s;wer, and it was likewi&s;e true that the Pre&s;ident might have &s;ent them his &s;peech by his &s;ecretary, without coming near them at all. He had come to Congre&s;s, and Mr. Murray could perceive no impropriety in Congre&s;s returning the compliment by waiting on him.</P>
<P>The committee divided on the amendment propo&s;ed by Mr. Parker. Eighteen members ro&s;e in &s;upport of it, &s;o it was lo&s;t. The committee then agreed to the re&s;olution, as offered by Mr. Murray. They ro&s;e, and the Chairman reported progre&s;s. The re&s;olution was agreed to by the Hou&s;e. The next que&s;tion was of how many members the &s;elect committee &s;hould con&s;i&s;t, that were to be employed in framing a draft of the addre&s;s. The different numbers of <HI>five</HI> and <HI>three</HI> were propo&s;ed. A divi&s;ion took place on the former motion, when only thirty-one gentlemen ro&s;e in its favour. The motion for a committee of three mem|bers to report an addre&s;s was of cour&s;e carried. Mr. Ma|di&s;on, Mr. Sedgwick and Mr. Sitgreaves were appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="030229_0026_0FE54D611E317248">REMARKS&mdash;HERE was a direct attempt, on the part of <HI>Mr. Parker,</HI> to &s;et a&s;ide a re&s;pectful cu&s;|tom, which was coeval with the operation of the Con&s;titution of the United States. One would imagine that this in&s;trument was grown out of fa|vour with the member from Virginia; but we &s;hall be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at this, when we come, by and by, to &s;ee the in&s;tructions of his &s;tate to its Senators in Congre&s;s.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS IN ANSWER TO THE SPEECH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, 15th <HI>December,</HI> 1795.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e went into a committee on the report of the &s;e|lect committe of an addre&s;s in an&s;wer to the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech.</P>
<P>The following paragraph gave ri&s;e to &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Contemplating that <HI>probably unequalled</HI> &s;pectacle of na|tional happine&s;s, which our country exhibits, to the inte|re&s;ting &s;ummary which you, Sir, have been plea&s;ed to make, in ju&s;tice to our own feelings, permit us to add the bene|fits which are derived from your pre&s;iding in our councils <HI>re&s;ulting as well from the</HI> UNDIMINISHED <HI>confidence of your fellow citizens, as from your zealous and &s;ucce&s;sful labours in their &s;ervice.</HI>"</P>
<P>MR. PARKER <HI>(Virginia)</HI> moved to &s;trike out the words <HI>probably unequalled,</HI> which was carried, 43 again&s;t 39.</P>
<P>He then moved to &s;trike out from the word <HI>re&s;ulting</HI> to the end of the paragraph.</P>
<P>MR. MURRAY, (who, as the chairman was about to put the que&s;tion on Mr. Parker's motion) &s;aid that he could not in ju&s;tice to the opinions of his con&s;tituents, &amp;c. of the &s;tate of Maryland at large, give a &s;ilent vote. He would &s;tate to the committee a recent fact that warranted him in declaring that the Pre&s;ident po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the ample&s;t man|ner, the confidence of the citizens of Maryland. The Legi&s;lature of that &s;tate probably fore&s;eeing the efforts of certain per&s;ons to dimini&s;h the confidence of the public in the chief magi&s;trate, had pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution which ap|pears to have been unanimous, by which they declare to the world, the mo&s;t perfect confidence in the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030229_0027_0FE54D6382EEF230">This fact though known certainly to many, might not be known to all pre&s;ent; and as in this &s;olemn te&s;timony of approbation and confidence, he totally co-incided he could neither be entirely &s;ilent when a que&s;tion like this implies the contrary &s;entiment, nor withold from gentlemen a great fact &s;o recently di&s;playing the undimini&s;hed confi|dence of the &s;tate of Maryland.</P>
<P>MR. GILES <HI>(Virginia)</HI> hoped that the latter amendment would not take any di&s;agreeable turn. He was not prepa|red to go, at length, into the propo&s;itions. He did not think it incon&s;i&s;tent with all due re&s;pect for the Pre&s;ident to &s;horten this clau&s;e.</P>
<P>A member propo&s;ed to re&s;trict this amendment to mere|ly &s;triking out the word <HI>undimini&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>MR. HARPER <HI>(S. Carolina)</HI> thought the Pre&s;ident as wi&s;e as hone&s;t and faithful a public &s;ervant as po&s;&s;iby could be. He was not prepared to &s;ay that the Pre&s;ident was as popular as he formerly has been, but there is no doubt of his being rein&s;tated in the confidence of the public. Mr. Harper was confident that four fifths of us &s;till tru&s;t in him. But Mr. Harper thought that objections might be made to the clau&s;e as it now &s;tands, and he de&s;igned, when the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to move an amend|ment.</P>
<P>MR. PARKER informed the hou&s;e that, with much re|&s;pect for the Pre&s;ident, his confidence had <HI>dimini&s;hed.</HI> He agreed to limit his amendment to &s;triking out the word <HI>undimini&s;hed,</HI> in the clau&s;e above quoted.</P>
<P>MR. SEDGWICK <HI>(Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts)</HI> ob&s;erved, that it had now, in con&s;equence of the motion for &s;triking out the word <HI>undimini&s;hed,</HI> became a que&s;tion of fact, whether our own and our con&s;tituents confidence in the Pre&s;ident was or was not dimini&s;hed? To &s;uppo&s;e the former, in his o|pinion, was un&s;upported by facts, was di&s;graceful to our con&s;tituents, and mu&s;t in the end prove baneful to that &s;y&s;tem of government which we were attempting to admi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>That &s;o far as he was acquainted with the actual di&s;po|&s;ition of the people, of that part of the country, where a|lone he could have obtained competent knowledge, he was as certain as he could be, of any public &s;entiments, that confidence in the Pre&s;ident, &s;o far from having been dimi|ni&s;hed by the artifices which had been made, on the con|trary
<PB N="27" REF="030229_0028_0FE54D6BCDB93AB8">
had been increa&s;ed; and he felt perfectly &s;ure, that at no antecedent period, had the tide of popular affection, &s;et &s;o &s;trongly towards him as at the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>This part of the addre&s;s expre&s;&s;ed our own and our con|&s;tituents undimini&s;hed confidence in the Pre&s;ident; and an acknowledgment of his zealous and &s;ucce&s;sful labours in the public &s;ervice. That he had approved of this part of the addre&s;s, as a member of the &s;elect committee, and on re|viewing, &s;ince, the &s;ubject, he had found no cau&s;e to reject the opinion whith he had then formed. He did believe, and he loved to believe, becau&s;e it was honourable to his con&s;tituents, that the late efforts, which had been made, had, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;ed the public confidence. That a late mea&s;ure of the Executive had indeed provided a fit occa&s;ion for a di&s;clo&s;ure of enmities which prudence and policy had heretofore concealed, <HI>but</HI> had not &s;haken the well founded reliance of the public on the wi&s;dom and in|tegrity of the Pre&s;ident. To &s;uppo&s;e an abatement of con|fidence, in his opinion, was to &s;uppo&s;e in the people a want of a due &s;en&s;e of gratitude, for the di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ings which they enjoyed; it was to &s;uppo&s;e a ba&s;ene&s;s of di&s;po|&s;ition unworthy of their former conduct, unworthy of free|men. "Who," he a&s;ked, "of a candid mind, and fair and honourable &s;entiments, can take a review of the glori|ous conduct of our chief during the conflict of the revolu|lution; his zealous and &s;ucce&s;sful labours for the public good; his bravery, moderation and humanity: who can follow him to the place of his happy retirement, and there again behold him, covered with glory, attended by the gratitude and affection of his fellow citizens, and the ap|plau&s;es of the world; who can &s;ee him again, i&s;&s;uing at the call of his countrymen, from this retirement, and put|ting at hazard for their benefit, the mighty ma&s;s of reputa|tion which he had collected, that be&s;t reward of virtuous minds; who can review the &s;ituation of this country for the &s;ix years of his admini&s;tration, the dangers to which we have been expo&s;ed, and the happy e&s;capes we have expe|rienced, effected by his prudence, &s;agacity, and firmne&s;s; who can review the conduct of the pre&s;ident in tho&s;e inte|re&s;ting &s;cenes, but with a heart filled with gratitude, affec|tion and confidence?"</P>
<P>No man, he hoped, in his heart; no man, he believed, would, con&s;i&s;tent with a due regard to his own reputation, deny to the Pre&s;ident his ju&s;t claims of merit. No man
<PB N="28" REF="030229_0029_0FE54D6D94D06A38">
could without di&s;gracing his con&s;tituents, deny their par|ticipation in this &s;entiment. It only remained, then, to be enquired whether the&s;e ju&s;t feelings of their, and our hearts, ought under the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, to be pub|li&s;hed to the world. He held this declaration to be, at this moment, an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation, due from the repre|&s;entatives of the people, from a regard to them&s;elves, their con&s;tituents, and the permanent and beneficial exi&s;tence of the government which they had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Although the Pre&s;ident had twice been called, by the unanimous and un&s;olicited voice of his countrymen, to pre|&s;ide in their government; though to comply with their wi&s;hes, he had &s;acrificed more than any other man could have done, and although the only reward he &s;ought or would accept, was their approbation; yet licentious and turbulent pre&s;&s;es, had teemed with &s;candalous and infa|mous abu&s;e. What &s;entiments by the&s;e cau&s;es might be produced in his mind, whether pity, contempt or indigna|tion, or a mixture of them all, he could not determine, nor was it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire further to determine whe|ther we &s;hould attempt to defeat their effects. In no man|ner could this be done, &s;o effectually, as by declaring our own and our con&s;tituents confidence in him.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident had told the Legi&s;lature, that it was the favourable wi&s;h of his heart, to unite with us, in our ef|forts to pre&s;erve, prolong, and improve our immen&s;e ad|vantages. Did we believe this declaration? why then &s;hould we not unite in counteracting, the malignant efforts of &s;edition, by publi&s;hing the &s;entiment, at once ju&s;t to him and honourable to our&s;elves?</P>
<P>The efforts which had been made to depreciate the cha|racter of that fir&s;t of men and of patriots; in&s;tead of pro|ducing the nefarious intention, he believed in his con&s;ci|ence, had increa&s;ed as it ought, the public confidence and regard. Thus feeling and believing, he wi&s;hed to re&s;cue our country from the imputation of ba&s;ene&s;s and ingrati|tude, which otherwi&s;e it would appear to merit.</P>
<P>But it was &s;aid that an expre&s;&s;ion of confidence, at this time, might be con&s;trued into a declaration of approbation of a late mea&s;ure of the Executive, and preclude the right of examining that mea&s;ure according to its merit, whene|ver it &s;hould be laid before the Legi&s;lature. To this he an|&s;wered, that, for him&s;elf he had no &s;uch intention, and he believed it incapable of &s;uch a con&s;truction. Confi|dence
<PB N="29" REF="030229_0030_0FE54D6F24A8FAB0">
did not imply an approbation of every part of the officer's conduct, to whom it belonged, it did not exclude the idea of falibility; but it only implied an approbation of the general tenor of his conduct.</P>
<P>If when the fir&s;t officer of our government was thus at|tacked, he was left to be overwhelmed by a torrent of abu&s;e, without the countenance and &s;upport of his con&s;tituents, or their repre&s;entatives; what man, he a&s;ked, who had ta|lents to be u&s;eful, reputation to lo&s;e, or feelings to be wounded, would put all at hazard to &s;erve an ungrateful country? What would &s;uch mean and ba&s;e de&s;ertion pro|duce, but to make the fir&s;t offices of our government, po&s;ts to which merit would be uncongenial&mdash;what! but to pro|vide vacancies to be filled by harpies who would prey on the vitals of the Republic?</P>
<P>There was another circum&s;tance which pre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf on his reflections on this occa&s;ion. It was the character&mdash; the ju&s;t character which the Pre&s;ident po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es throughout the civilized world. What would it be, to reject this part of the addre&s;s, but to ju&s;tify tho&s;e, he hoped, unfounded a&s;per&s;ions, which had been made on Republican govern|ments? What! but to verify tho&s;e malign predictions which had been pointed at our own &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>Thus had he expo&s;ed to the committee, as conci&s;ely as he could, his own views of this important &s;ubject. He would only add, that when the Pre&s;ident entered fir&s;t on the execution of the important duties of his office, the man who would have dared to predict, that the pre&s;ent que&s;tion would at this time, have become a &s;ubject of be|bate, would have been con&s;idered as predicting the infamy of his country.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON &s;aid that there were many who&s;e con|fidence was impaired by a late tran&s;action. He could not therefore con&s;ent to the expre&s;&s;ion in the draft of the ad|dre&s;s. Mr. Sedgwick had &s;aid that con&s;enting to &s;trike out the word <HI>undimini&s;hed,</HI> would be telling the world that our confidence actually is dimini&s;hed; and the member from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts adds, that the Hou&s;e are thus brought into a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dilemma. If there is a di&s;tre&s;s in the ca&s;e, it originates with this member him&s;elf, as one of the com|mittee who brought in this draft of an addre&s;s. He moved, to prevent any unconciliating debates, that the addre&s;s might be recommitted. The motion was &s;econded by Mr.
<PB N="30" REF="030229_0031_0FE54D712DC7D558">
Sedgwick. The committee ro&s;e, and the re&s;olution for recommitting pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was then moved that two members &s;hould be added to the committee on draughting the addre&s;s. Mr. Tracy con&s;idered the pre&s;ent number as &s;ufficient. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Baldwin were added.</P>

<P>THE &s;elect committee reported the following addre&s;s to the Pre&s;ident, in an&s;wer to his Speech to both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, which was unanimou&s;ly agreed to:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<HEAD>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the Repre&s;entatives of the people of the United States, we cannot but participate in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ibi|lity to every ble&s;&s;ing which they enjoy, and cheerfully join with you, in profound gratitude to the author of all good, for the numerous and extraordinary ble&s;&s;ings which he has conferred on our favoured country.</P>
<P>A final and formal termination of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, which has ravaged our North We&s;tern Frontier, will be an event, which mu&s;t afford a &s;atisfaction proportioned to the anxiety with which it has long been &s;ought; and in the adju&s;tment of the terms, we perceive the true policy of making them &s;atisfactory to the Indians, as well as to the United States, as the be&s;t ba&s;is of a durable tranquility. The di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch of the &s;outhern tribes, as had al&s;o heretofore annoyed our frontier, is another pro&s;pect in our &s;ituation &s;o important to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the United States, that it is much to be lamented, that any clouds &s;hould be thrown over it, more e&s;pecially, by ex|ce&s;&s;es on the part of our own citizens.</P>
<P>While our population is advancing with a celerity which exceeds the mo&s;t &s;anguine calculations&mdash;while every part of the United States di&s;plays indications of rapid and various improvement&mdash;while we are in the enjoyment of protection and &s;ecurity, by mild and whole&s;ome laws, admini&s;tered by governments founded on the genuine principles of ra|tional liberty, a &s;ecure foundation will be laid for accelerat|ing, maturing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the pro&s;perity of our country; if, by treaty and amicable negociation, all tho&s;e cau&s;es of external di&s;cord, which heretofore menaced our tranquility,
<PB N="31" REF="030229_0032_0FE54D78E1BA1FF0">
&s;hall be extingui&s;hed, on terms compatible with our na|tional rights and honor, and with our con&s;titution, and great commercial intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Among the various circum&s;tances in our internal &s;itua|tion, none can be viewed, with more &s;atisfaction and ex|ultation, than that the late &s;cene of di&s;order and in&s;ur|rection, has been completely re&s;tored, to the enjoyment of order and repo&s;e. Such a triumph of rea&s;on and of law, is worthy of the free government, under which it happen|ed, and was ju&s;tly to be hoped, from the enlightened and patriotic &s;pirit, which pervades and actuates the people of the United States.</P>
<P>In contemplating that &s;pectacle of national happine&s;s, which our country exhibits, and of which, you, Sir, have been plea&s;ed to make an intere&s;ting &s;ummary, permit us to acknowledge and declare the very great &s;hare, which your zealous and faithful &s;ervices have contributed to it, and to expre&s;s the affectionate attachment, which we feel for your character.</P>
<P>The &s;everal intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, which you recommend to our con&s;ideration, will receive every degree of atten|tion, which is due to them: And whil&s;t we feel the ob|ligation of temperance and mutual indulgence, in all our di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, we tru&s;t and pray, that the re&s;ult to the hap|pine&s;s and welfare of our country may corre&s;pond with the pure affection we bear to it.</P>

The &s;entiments we have mutu|ally expre&s;&s;ed, of profound gratitude to the &s;ource of tho&s;e numerous ble&s;&s;ings, the AUTHOR OF ALL GOOD, are pledges of our obligations, to unite our &s;incere and zealous en|deavors, as the in&s;truments of Divine Providence, to pre|&s;erve and perpetuate them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="030229_0033_0FE54D7AD8FD5E90">Accept, Gentlemen, my thanks for your declaration, that to my agency you a&s;cribe the enjoyment of a great &s;hare of the&s;e benefits. So far as my &s;ervices contribute to the happine&s;s of my country, the acknowledgment thereof, by my fellow citizens, and their affectionate at|tachment, will ever prove an abundant reward.</P>

<P>REMARKS&mdash;THUS ended this part of the pro|ceedings, in a manner, which, perhaps, reflects but little honour on the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>The &s;entiment contained in the propo&s;ed addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing an <HI>undimini&s;hed</HI> confidence in the Pre|&s;ident, &s;eemed to me the mo&s;t proper that any combination of words could convey; and particu|larly on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The mea&s;ures of the chief Magi&s;trate had been mo&s;t violently op|po&s;ed; he had been all but menaced, in order to deter him from the exerci&s;e of powers ve&s;ted in him by the con&s;titution; his motives had been disfigur|ed, and his character reviled. This was to be ex|pected from the leaders of a faction, aver&s;e to his admini&s;tration and even to the government, and from tho&s;e among the people whom they had been able to mi&s;lead. But, were the declarations of the&s;e turbulent demagogues; were the licentious a&s;per&s;ions and abominable fal&s;hoods of <HI>Valerius,</HI> and the re&s;t of that <HI>hired</HI> tribe, to be &s;econded by the legi&s;lators of the union? On this addre&s;s the mal|contents had fixed their eyes: from it they expect|ed encouragement or reproof. To be &s;ilent was to encourage. The Repre&s;entatives knew that the feel|ings of the Pre&s;ident had been deeply wounded, and it was their place to admini&s;ter the healing balm. To effect this, and at once to &s;ilence the hydra of faction, nothing was &s;o well calculated as a firm and explicit declaration, that their confidence was <HI>undimini&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>However, had not the word <HI>undimini&s;hed</HI> been introduced into the propo&s;ed addre&s;s, the omi&s;&s;ion of that epithet would have been of le&s;s con&s;equence;
<PB N="33" REF="030229_0034_0FE54D7C702B0248">
but, when once propo&s;ed, to expunge it by a vote of the Hou&s;e, was to declare to the whole union, and even to the whole world, that the Pre&s;ident had <HI>lo&s;t the confidence of his fellow citizens;</HI> a decla|ration that in &s;ome countries precedes a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from office, downfall, and di&s;grace!</P>
<P>Mr. PARKER, who made the motion for &s;triking out the word <HI>undimini&s;hed,</HI> tells us plainly, that, "with much <HI>re&s;pect</HI> for the Pre&s;ident, his <HI>confidence</HI> was <HI>dimini&s;hed;</HI>" and thus, in this &s;hort &s;entence, advances the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency that ever fell from the lips of mortal man. His confidence dimini&s;hes, while his re&s;pect remains undimini&s;hed! Unle&s;s, indeed, we are to imagine that his re|&s;pect was in a con&s;umption as well as his confidence. Such a paradoxical avowal might &s;hine in the lu|natic reveries of a Rou&s;&s;eau; but is little congenial with the &s;obriety of legi&s;lative debate.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are far from being inapplica|ble to the addre&s;s finally agreed on by the hou&s;e. On the 16th of December, they <Q>acknowledge and declare, that the <HI>zealous</HI> and <HI>faithful &s;ervices</HI> of the Pre&s;ident have had a very great &s;hare in contributing to the happine&s;s of the country; and expre&s;s the <HI>affectionate attachment,</HI> they feel for his character,</Q> when, but the very day before, they had determined that their confidence in him was dimini&s;hed! If they were per&s;uaded, that his zeal and faithful &s;ervices had &s;o eminently contri|buted to the happine&s;s of the country, what rea&s;on had they to declare that their confidence was di|mini&s;hed? And, if their confidence was dimini&s;h|ed, how could his character de&s;erve their affection|ate attachment? There is no medium here: confi|dence in a public man, is like virtue in a woman; as long as it exi&s;ts at all, it mu&s;t be unimpaired. It is intire, or it is no more.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="030229_0035_0FE54D7E059B5D20">It was ea&s;y to perceive why this medley of <HI>re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>want of confidence</HI> was introduced into the de|bate. Twenty years of military and civil &s;ervices, attended with a &s;ucce&s;s unexampled in the annals of the world, and backed with a life of piety and &s;potle&s;s virtue, were not to be annihilated at a blow. This citadel of reputation could not be carried by a&s;&s;ault. The more prudent, becau&s;e, perhaps, the more &s;ure way, was to attack it by a hidden and cir|cuitous route.</P>
<P>There is no telling with what &s;ucce&s;s this may be attended; but certain it is, that it will not be the fault of Mr. Parker, and tho&s;e who &s;ided with him on this occa&s;ion, if General Wa&s;hington, or any other man who has a reputation to lo&s;e, &s;hould a|gain be &s;een at the head of the government. The three branches &s;hould be checks on each other, it is true; but, if they are not al&s;o mutual &s;upports, the whole fabrick will &s;oon crumble to the ground; and the degree of popular &s;trength, whatever that may be, acquired by the Repre&s;entative branch through the pre&s;ent deci&s;ion, mu&s;t inevitably tend to enfee|ble the other two.</P>

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE ATTEMPT AT CORRUPTION BY RANDALL AND WHITNEY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>MONDAY, <HI>December</HI> 28th, 1795.</DATE></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="debate">
<P>Mr. SMITH (S. C.) reque&s;ted the attention of the Hou&s;e, for a moment, to a &s;ubject of a very delicate na|ture. He under&s;tood that a memorial was, this morning, to be pre&s;ented from &s;ome individuals, applying for a grant of a large tract of We&s;tern Territory, and as the Hou&s;e had referred all &s;uch applicants to the committee for bring|ing in the land office bill, of which he was Chairman; and as it was probable that the memorial about to be pre|&s;ented would be di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner, he con|ceived it a duty incumbent on him to di&s;clo&s;e to the Hou&s;e,
<PB N="35" REF="030229_0036_0FE54D82A4243668">
at this time, &s;ome circum&s;tances which had come to his knowledge. Mr. Smith then &s;aid, that on Tue&s;day even|ing la&s;t, a per&s;on of the name of Randall, called on him, reque&s;ting an hour of confidential conver&s;ation: In the in|terview which took place, Randall made a communication to the following effect. He intended to pre&s;ent a memo|rial on the Monday following to Congre&s;s, for a grant of all the we&s;tern lands, lying between lakes Michigan, Erie, and Huron, to the amount of about twenty millions of acres. He, and his a&s;&s;ociates, &s;ome of whom were Ca|nada merchants, who had great influence over the Indi|ans, propo&s;ed to form a company and to undertake the ex|tinction of the Indian title, provided Congre&s;s would cede to them the fee &s;imple of the land. The property would be divided into forty &s;hares, twenty-four of which &s;hould be re&s;erved for &s;uch members of Congre&s;s as might <HI>favour</HI> the &s;cheme, and might be inclined to come into it, after the adjournment of Congre&s;s, on the &s;ame terms as the ori|ginal a&s;&s;ociators. Randall him&s;elf had the di&s;po&s;al of twelve &s;hares, for members from the &s;outhern &s;tates, and colleagues of his, a like number for tho&s;e of the ea&s;tern &s;tates. A certain number of &s;hares were to be the proper|ty of tho&s;e Canada merchants, who had an unbounded in|fluence over the Indians occupying tho&s;e lands, and who would, if this plan &s;ucceeded, pacify tho&s;e Indians, who were the mo&s;t ho&s;tile to the United States: that General Wayne's treaty was a mere delu&s;ion, and that without the co-operation of tho&s;e influential per&s;ons, the United States would never have peace in that quarter. Mr. Smith &s;aid, that he had communicated this overture the next morn|ing to Mr. Murray, one of the members from Maryland, re|que&s;ting his advice how to proceed on &s;o delicate an occa|&s;ion; that Mr. Murray recommended a di&s;clo&s;ure to Mr. Henry of the Senate, and that, on a con&s;ultation with tho&s;e gentlemen, it was re&s;olved that it was Mr. Smith's duty to make an immediate communication of the matter to the Pre&s;ident, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY ro&s;e next. He had received an applica|tion of the &s;ame nature, but having already heard of the propo&s;al, "I was," &s;aid Mr. Murray, "in a &s;tate of pre|paration, and my virtue had not &s;uch a &s;hock to encounter, as that of the gentleman la&s;t up."</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY corroborated what Mr. Smith had &s;aid as to the communication of this affair to him&s;elf. He added, he ad|vi&s;ed
<PB N="36" REF="030229_0037_0FE5473451C42FF0">
Mr. Smith to give Randall another meeting for the pur|po&s;e of developing his &s;cheme and expectations more fully.</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY &s;aid that Mr. Smith informed him on Wedne&s;day morning; next day in the morning, he inform|ed Mr. Henry of the Senate. Mr. Smith, on that day, informed the Pre&s;ident. On that day (Thur&s;day) Mr. Randall was introduced to him, and a&s;ked an interview at his lodging; he gave him an appointment at five in the af|ternoon. Mr. Henry and he were together when Randall came in. Randall talked about the policy of extingui&s;hing the Indian title to the Penin&s;ula, formed by lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, containing about eighteen or twen|ty millions of acres of very good land; and talked in terms that he might have employed from a pulpit. He did not make any corrupt overtures, till Mr. Murray had carried him into his own apartment. There Randall opened his propo&s;als, as had been before mentioned by Mr. Smith, ob&s;erving, that if Congre&s;s would &s;ell this land to him and his company, they intended to divide it into forty or forty-one &s;hares. Twenty-four &s;hares were to be appropriated to &s;uch members of Congre&s;s, as cho&s;e to &s;upport the me|morial, which would be pre&s;ented on Monday. The mem|bers were to have their &s;hares on the &s;ame terms on which his company &s;hould obtain the land. The company would give five hundred thou&s;and, or perhaps a million of dollars; but on Mr. Murray's apparent acquie&s;cence in his views, he &s;aid that the &s;hares would be given to the members who advocated the mea&s;ure, if they plea&s;ed to accept them, af|ter they returned to their homes. Mr. Murray &s;tarted a difficulty about the embarra&s;&s;ment of land &s;peculations, for which he, per&s;onally, had no genius; and then Randall in&s;tantly turned out the cat, and told him, that if <HI>he</HI> did not choo&s;e the &s;hare of land, he &s;hould have ca&s;h in hand for his &s;hare. Mr. Smith and Mr. Murray had re&s;olved to di&s;clo&s;e this to the Hou&s;e, le&s;t &s;ome innocent member might offer a memorial, and become liable to &s;u&s;picion. Randall had hinted that larger proportions would be a&s;&s;ign|ed to the more active members, and le&s;&s;er ones for <HI>the &s;mall fi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Speaker then ro&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that &s;ome gentleman would move for an order to apprehend Randall. Upon this Mr. Smith again ro&s;e, and &s;aid that a warrant to this effect had ye&s;terday been i&s;&s;ued by the Pre&s;ident, and to &s;upport which, Mr. Smith had made oath before
<PB N="37" REF="030229_0038_0FE54D8A66365558">
a magi&s;trate to the particulars above mentioned. He hoped that by this time the per&s;on was taken.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES ro&s;e next, and ob&s;erved that an application from the &s;ame Mr. Randall had been made to him&s;elf. Be&s;ides a repetition of &s;ome particulars already &s;tated, he told Mr. Giles that he had already &s;ecured thirty or forty members of this Hou&s;e, but he wanted to &s;ecure three o|ther members, if Mr. Giles recollected right. He added, that he had already &s;ecured a majority in the Senate. When this propo&s;al was fir&s;t made, which he thought was about ten days ago, a member from New-York (Mr. Li|ving&s;ton) was pre&s;ent. Randall had even gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, that a written agreement was drawn out, and &s;ub&s;crib|ed by a number of ea&s;tern members, and he wi&s;hed Mr. Giles to extend another obligation of the &s;ame kind for the &s;outhern members, the purport of which paper was under&s;tood to be, that the members who voted in &s;up|port of the di&s;po&s;al of the lands, were to be &s;ecured in a &s;tipulated &s;hare of them, without having their names mentioned in the deed. Mr. Giles was &s;olicitous to learn the names of the members who had <HI>already</HI> entered into the negociation, but Randall a&s;&s;ured him, that, from mo|tives of delicacy, he dur&s;t not communicate any of the names. Mr. Giles then de&s;ired a &s;ight of the agreement, that he might be able to comprehend its meaning, before he &s;hould attempt to draw any &s;imilar paper. The man called a &s;econd time, and, as Mr. Giles conceived, about four days ago, but never could produce either the deed or any draft of it. Mr. Giles had already communicated the propo&s;al to &s;everal members, and, in particular, to the Speaker.</P>
<P>The Speaker (Mr. Dayton) mentioned, that Mr. Giles had, &s;ome time ago, informed him of the propo&s;al. He replied, that if an opportunity offered, <HI>he would take care to &s;elect a committee con&s;i&s;ting of members &s;ure to detect the guilty,</HI> if any &s;uch could exi&s;t; adding, that he expected the Hou&s;e to believe that he would not have u&s;ed &s;uch words, but on &s;o extraordinary an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. CHRISTIE &s;aid that he was the per&s;on who introduc|ed Randall to Mr. Smith and Mr. Murray. He had long known him as a re&s;pectable man. He had mentioned to Mr. Chri&s;tie, in general, that it was a landed &s;peculation; and hinted that he, Mr. Chri&s;tie, might accept of a &s;hare. In reply, that gentleman a&s;&s;ured him, that he could not
<PB N="38" REF="030229_0039_0FE54D8C7967A5F0">
po&s;&s;ibly have a concern in any &s;uch tran&s;action. Randall had not, to Mr. Chri&s;tie, in&s;inuated that any undue advan|tages would accrue to members &s;upporting the intended purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Buck, a member from Vermont, mentioned, that a per&s;on of the name of Whitney, who appears to have been an a&s;&s;ociate with Randall, had called upon him in the country, with a propo&s;al of this kind.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<P>REMARKS.&mdash;I never was more &s;urpri&s;ed in my life, than when I heard Mr. Dayton, the Speaker, avow, that he had told Mr. Giles, he would <HI>take care to &s;elect &s;uch a committee</HI> as &s;hould detect the <HI>guilty,</HI> if any &s;uch could exi&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;entence from the Speaker di&s;covers to us, that he had but an indifferent opinion of the in|tegrity of &s;ome of the members of the Hou&s;e: for, had not this been the ca&s;e, he would not have fal|len on a plan of <HI>detecting</HI> the <HI>guilty.</HI> The <HI>qualify|ing phra&s;e,</HI> "if any &s;uch could exi&s;t," does by no means do away the exi&s;tence of &s;u&s;picion in his mind; for, if no &s;u&s;picion exi&s;ted, why &s;hould he talk of <HI>taking care to &s;elect a committee</HI> for the pur|po&s;e of detection. This la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion has al&s;o &s;omething of a party nature in it. Mr. Dayton &s;hould have pre&s;umed that <HI>every member</HI> in the Hou&s;e would be anxious to detect guilt: to &s;ay that he would take care <HI>to &s;elect</HI> &s;uch a committee as would do this, was not only to pre&s;ume, that there were &s;ome members who would <HI>not do it,</HI> but it was to hint, at the &s;ame time, that he knew, or, at lea&s;t, gue&s;&s;ed, <HI>who tho&s;e members were.</HI> This conclu&s;ion is inevitable; for, it would have been an ab&s;urdity, which &s;o &s;en&s;ible a man as the Speaker could not have fallen into, to propo&s;e to him&s;elf the &s;electing of &s;uch a committee as would be <HI>&s;ure</HI> to detect the guilty, if he had had an equal confidence in all the members of the Hou&s;e, or if he had not had &s;ome particular members in his eye, whom he
<PB N="39" REF="030229_0040_0FE54D8EDA512EC0">
looked upon as men of more integrity than &s;ome others.</P>
<P>I know not how the Hou&s;e felt on this occa&s;ion; but, had I been a member, I freely declare, that I &s;hould have felt my honour much more deeply wounded by this &s;ugge&s;tion of the Speaker, than by any thing that could po&s;&s;ibly have been advan|ced, or even proved, by the land-jobbers them|&s;elves. If he had incautiou&s;ly let fall &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions to Mr. Giles, there was certainly no kind of nece&s;&s;ity for repeating them in public, unle&s;s cal|led upon to that effect. This is by no means the lea&s;t exceptionable circum&s;tance, as, the una&s;ked-for repetition of the &s;ugge&s;tion, &s;eems to have been merely a lure for popularity; a trick always be|neath an independent member of Congre&s;s, and more e&s;pecially &s;o, when that popularity is to be ob|tained at the expence of his colleagues.</P>

<P>Mr. BLOUNT brought forward a re&s;olution in nearly the following words: <Q>Re&s;olved, that it be made a charge again&s;t Robert Randall, that he declared to a member of this Hou&s;e, that a number, con&s;i&s;ting of not le&s;s than thirty members of this Hou&s;e had engaged to &s;upport his memorial.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY called upon gentlemen, by their &s;en&s;ibili|ty to per&s;onal dignity, and the character of the Hou&s;e, to arre&s;t the motion. Its tendency certainly was to place the honour of the Hou&s;e, or a very great part of it, in the power of a man of who&s;e known profligacy of principles there could now be no doubt. Will you, he ob&s;erved, per|mit, nay invite him, whom you arraign at the bar of this Hou&s;e, to be <HI>a public accu&s;er!</HI> Will you adopt a charge a|gain&s;t him, which is in its nature an imputation that how|ever lightly and wickedly made, will implicate perhaps in|nocent men. The&s;e men to re&s;cue their own reputations will be obliged to ri&s;que their characters, on the weight of their veracity, by denying this man's charge in the face of a world but too prone to &s;u&s;pect&mdash;By this motion Randall's a&s;&s;ertion to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) the
<PB N="40" REF="030229_0041_0FE54D9547532EE0">
only member who has mentioned it, is to be alledged a|gain&s;t Randall as an offence. That Randall &s;aid to the gentleman, that there were thirty or forty members <HI>&s;ecured</HI> he had no doubt&mdash;but he believed the fact to be that Ran|dall was both deceived him&s;elf and attempted to deceive the gentleman&mdash;"Why," &s;aid Mr. Murray, "the fellow told me that there were thirty members &s;ecured."&mdash;Mr. Murray had not thought proper to &s;tate that circum&s;tance, becau&s;e he did not &s;o much con&s;ider it as a fact material to the detection of Randall's guilt, as it was one which if mentioned might po&s;&s;ibly afford to malice an opportunity of affixing a &s;tigma to any thirty or forty names at which per|&s;onal enmity might point&mdash;no public good could re&s;ult from &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure&mdash;for the a&s;&s;ertion of &s;uch a man as Randall could not among men of honour be deemed a &s;uf|ficient ground of &s;u&s;picion; and yet the malice of the world, or the rancour of per&s;onal enemies might attach &s;u&s;|picion and di&s;honour to almo&s;t the whole Hou&s;e, from the indefinitene&s;s of the charge. When Randall informed him, on Thur&s;day night, that there were thirty members, who would &s;upport his mea&s;ures, he had felt in the very conduct which he was then him&s;elf pur&s;uing to detect Randall, to arre&s;t his &s;cheme, a principle of candour to|wards others, which taught him that other gentlemen to whom Randall had communicated his &s;cheme <HI>confidentially,</HI> were probably determined as hone&s;tly as him&s;elf to cru&s;h the infamous plot again&s;t the honour of the Hou&s;e. He knew that he who would be wicked enough to attempt &s;eduction, might be weak enough to u&s;e this intelligence artfully, for the purpo&s;e of leading him the more readily to accept terms of infamy; becau&s;e the object was painted as ea&s;ily attain|able; and that Randall might wi&s;h to dimini&s;h all qualms, by exhibiting a pretended group of accomplices who&s;e com|pany would at lea&s;t dimini&s;h the appearance of &s;ingula|rity.&mdash;I entertained, &s;aid Mr. Murray, no &s;u&s;picion of any man&mdash;I knew Randall to be a corrupt man from his offers to my&s;elf&mdash;I therefore placed all his intelligence to the &s;core of flim&s;y art&mdash;I knew that &s;uch a man was not to be fully believed, where his intere&s;t was to magnify his &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;I drew favourable au&s;pices with re&s;pect to the corps to which I belong, from another piece of intelligence of his, which was, that he communicated to &s;ome members, one of whom he had named, and whom I knew to be a man of honour, in what he called the <HI>general</HI> way.&mdash;This general
<PB N="41" REF="030229_0042_0FE54D96D95A8E08">
way was a di&s;play of the &s;ounder part of his &s;cheme mere|ly, and not the corrupt:&mdash;con&s;i&s;ting in developing the ad|vantages which would re&s;ult to the Union in the di&s;po&s;al of their lands, provided the harmony of the Indians could be &s;ecured&mdash;In this view of his plan he gave the &s;ubject an attitude far from unimpo&s;ing;&mdash;and I conceived that as in proportion to the numbers engaged confidentially he mu&s;t know that the hazard of detection increa&s;ed, he would not communicate the corrupt view as long as he found the more hone&s;t part of the policy might appear to &s;trike any gentle|man as a mea&s;ure u&s;eful to his country&mdash;I therefore <HI>did not believe</HI> Randall, in the &s;en&s;e he evidently intended. There|fore, Sir, I did not feel my&s;elf at liberty to mention the a&s;&s;ertion which I conceived to be unavailing as a circum|&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to the example I wi&s;hed to make, but which if communicated I thought might ca&s;t a &s;tain, by the my&s;|tery that enveloped it, upon a body who&s;e character ought to be held &s;acred to the confidence of the country. My duty was to bring Randall's attempt to corrupt unequivo|cally into light, not by repeating all the arts which he ex|cited to corrupt; nor by exhibiting them in a way that might wound the feelings of men of honour, who, if charg|ed even per&s;onally by Randall, would have no refuge from odium but in their characters and counter-a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;this though always conclu&s;ive with tho&s;e who per&s;onally know them, is not a protection to minds of &s;en&s;ibility again&s;t the &s;tings of calumny. The voice of fame is not compo&s;ed from the voice of men of honour.</P>
<P>It was he &s;aid in the &s;pirit of &s;uch reflections, that he and the gentleman with whom he had concerted the mode and time of di&s;clo&s;ure [Mr. W. Smith] had determined to tru&s;t rather to the as yet un&s;tained honour of the Hou&s;e, than to the loo&s;e declarations of Randall; and therefore had re&s;olved on Friday morning to make the di&s;clo&s;ure, be|fore that &s;ome gentlemen, innocent of the corrupt &s;cheme, and acquainted with the &s;ounder part of the plan only, might have cau&s;e to blu&s;h at having pre&s;ented a memorial which it would be their duty to defeat and cover with in|famy. If this charge is exhibited again&s;t Randall he will confe&s;s or deny it; if he confe&s;&s;es it, and in the di&s;po&s;ition that often accompanies detected guilt, &s;hould name parti|cular gentlemen, though their counter-a&s;&s;ertion, would completely, in his own mind, outweigh the charge of a
<PB N="42" REF="030229_0043_0FE54D987031D460">
corrupt and profligate accu&s;er like Randall, yet would eve|ry man of delicacy have cau&s;e to regret, that merely for the purpo&s;e of adding to the charges again&s;t a man proved to be wicked, a &s;tain had glanced from him upon a name innocent and honourable. Let gentlemen act with mag|nanimity upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;Let them re&s;i&s;t a motion, which, however purely conceived, may eventually wound hone&s;t fame, without detecting guilt.&mdash;Mr. Murray &s;o|lemnly believed, that Randall's a&s;&s;ertion was either fal&s;e totally, or true only as it re&s;pected tho&s;e who had li&s;tened to him, for the purpo&s;e of making an example&mdash;or tho&s;e to whom he had &s;poken in what he had called the <HI>general</HI> way. If Randall denied this charge, it would re&s;t on the a&s;&s;ertion of the gentleman from Virginia, but could not affect members farther, than as the mea&s;ure of enquiry &s;eemed to imply &s;u&s;picion. He and the gentleman from South Carolina had both acted upon the pre&s;umption of in|nocence in members, and they had re&s;olved on the timely di&s;clo&s;ure ye&s;terday, le&s;t even one member, however in|nocent, might be placed in a painful &s;ituation by pre&s;ent|ing the memorial. If Randall is charged with this as an offence, he verily believed the Hou&s;e betrayed its own ho|nour to the malice of the world&mdash;he would therefore vote decidedly again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Mr. Murray, in the cour&s;e of his &s;peech, added &s;everal other ob&s;ervations. He did not doubt that in every di&s;trict on the continent, thirty <HI>favourites</HI> would be pointed out, whom the people in that quarter, or at lea&s;t &s;ome among them, would be di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ign to infamy, and per|haps there was not one di&s;trict in the Union, where the &s;ame thirty members would be named. It would be &s;aid, "Sir, they are not named, but <HI>I know who are the men.</HI>" So rapid were the communications of the pre&s;s, &s;o keen the appetite for &s;candal, that when once the &s;tory was cir|culated, it might be impo&s;&s;ible ever to get rid of it.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES replied. He was in favour of the motion of Mr. Blount. He &s;aid it was evident from the way in which this whole communication had been brought forward, that there had been no previous corre&s;pondence between Mr. Murray and him&s;elf. They had felt differently. Mr. Giles had informed the Speaker of the Hou&s;e. M. Murray and his friend [Mr. W. Smith] had communicated the affair to the Pre&s;ident, a mea&s;ure of which, as it &s;truck Mr. Giles, he did not di&s;tinctly perceive the propriety. Mr. Giles had
<PB N="43" REF="030229_0044_0FE54D120FD187B0">
con&s;idered it as be&s;t to wait in &s;ilence, till the petition of Randall &s;hould come forward. Mr. Murray had &s;ugge&s;ted a variety of delicate motives for breaking the matter to the Hou&s;e, le&s;t the petition &s;hould come forward, and hurt the feelings of an innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting member. Mr. Giles did not wi&s;h to dimini&s;h the credit fully due to the gentleman in this re&s;pect. He him&s;elf had felt &s;omewhat differently. He had acted differently.</P>
<P>Mr. HILLHOUSE was convinced that there was not a gentleman in the hou&s;e, who&s;e character re&s;ted on &s;o &s;len|der a foundation, as to be affected by any thing this man could &s;ay. He felt no anxiety for the reputation of the Hou&s;e, for he knew that it was not in the &s;malle&s;t danger. The re&s;olution went merely to make Randall confe&s;s, that he had &s;aid &s;o and &s;o. It implied nothing tending to af|fect members. A man covered with infamy making &s;uch charges could not expect credit, or obtain it from any bo|dy. Mr. Hillhou&s;e was, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, in favour of the re&s;olution for interrogating Randall.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<P>REMARKS&mdash;In the deliberations of this day there is nothing that &s;eems to demand a particular remark, except it be the different manner of pro|ceedings of Me&s;&s;rs. Giles and Murray. Both the&s;e gentlemen had had the very &s;ame overtures made to them; but the former had informed the &s;peaker of the Hou&s;e, and <Q>con&s;idered it as be&s;t to wait in &s;ilence, 'till the petition of Randall &s;hould come forward;</Q> while Mr. Murray, on the contrary, had given information to the Pre&s;ident of the Unit|ed States, and had <Q>broke the matter to the hou&s;e, le&s;t the petition &s;hould come forward, and hurt the feelings of an innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting member.</Q></P>
<P>I do not pretend to determine what were the mo|tives of Mr. Giles: God forbid I &s;hould imagine them any other than tho&s;e of the pure&s;t patrioti&s;m. But, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the manner of his proceeding might, if adopted, become a very evil precedent. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, &s;ome determined party-man,
<PB N="44" REF="030229_0045_0FE54D9AC76F9080">
&s;ome fiery demagogue, who&s;e only food is popular applau&s;e, and who&s;e only object is to trouble or o|verturn: Suppo&s;e a patriot of this &s;tamp, &s;hould, at &s;ome future period, wi&s;h to cru&s;h, at all events, the moderate and upright part of the Hou&s;e? What would be the method he would take, if an oppor|tunity like the pre&s;ent offered it&s;elf?&mdash;He would li&s;ten to the land-jobbers, give them no po&s;itive re|fu&s;al or di&s;couragement, and would endeavour to get from them the names of the members &s;aid to be already gained. Then he would communicate the matter to the Speaker, if he knew him to be of the &s;ame party with him&s;elf. This done, they would wait in &s;ilence, keeping the affair a profound &s;ecret from all the members, except tho&s;e of their own faction. The trap thus &s;et, the hunters would lie clo&s;e, and the in&s;tant &s;ome innocent un&s;u&s;pecting man (perhaps pointed out by them&s;elves) fell into it, they would ru&s;h in upon him with all the ready-&s;harpened weapons of mi&s;con&s;truction, calumny and reproach; and, when they had effected his de&s;truc|tion, that of his friends, and of the government it|&s;elf, they would &s;hout out, <HI>glorious &s;port!</HI></P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, too, that &s;uch an unprincipled fac|tion might them&s;elves already lie under the im|putation of having been corupted; and, in that ca&s;e, a &s;troke of retaliation like this would be particular|ly agreeable. Men are but too prone to &s;eek for companions in di&s;grace. Revenge is &s;weet, at what|ever price it be purcha&s;ed. A faction already &s;unk to the bottomme&s;t pit of infamy, would feel a kind of con&s;olation in dragging down their colleagues, and even their country after them.</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY'S manner of proceeding was exact|ly the oppo&s;ite of all this. He laid no baits, &s;et no &s;pringes. He did not break the matter to one mem|ber or one party, but to the whole hou&s;e; and, if he &s;hewed le&s;s de&s;ire to <HI>"detect the guilty,"</HI> than Me&s;&s;rs. Giles and Dayton, he &s;howed a much great|er

de&s;ire to put innocence on its guard, and pre&s;erve the honor of the Hou&s;e unblemi&s;hed.</P>

<P>RANDALL and WHITNEY being in cu&s;tody, a debate took place with re&s;pect to allowing them coun&s;el at the bar of the Hou&s;e, which was al&s;o determined in the affirmative. On this occa&s;ion <HI>Mr. Chri&s;tie</HI> ob&s;erved, that he had known Randall <HI>for many years,</HI> and had never heard of any thing again&s;t him before. He had lately been at Detroit, and Mr. Chri&s;tie believed that he had been injured by keeping <HI>bad company.</HI>&mdash;He was not the fir&s;t man in the country who had been <HI>corrupted</HI> by <HI>Briti&s;h influence</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h com|pany.</HI> He moved that Randall &s;hould be allowed untill to|morrow at twelve o'clock. This was negatived.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<P>REMARKS&mdash;IT appeared to me particularly cru|el to negative this motion of Mr. Chri&s;tie's &s;eeing that poor Randall, whom <HI>Mr. Chri&s;tie had known for &s;o many years,</HI> had been injured by keeping <HI>bad com|pany.</HI> But, as to <HI>Briti&s;h influence,</HI> I could not for my life perceive, with what propriety it was brought in here. It &s;eemed rather a wanton attack on the character of a nation, who&s;e influence in the line of corruption has not been made apparent in this coun|try; and, I may add, it was a wanton attack on the people of this country too, to &s;ay that Randall "was <HI>not the fir&s;t</HI> man in it who had been <HI>corrupted</HI> by Briti&s;h influence," Mr. Chri&s;tie &s;eems, indeed, to have fallen into the cant of the oppo&s;ers of the treaty; for, we know, that they attributed its con|clu&s;ion and ratification to the influence of Briti&s;h Gold. We have &s;een the firm, candid and upright man, who negociated that treaty, and the Senators who advi&s;ed its ratification, burnt in an effigy, re|pre&s;enting them as receiving the gold of Great-Bri|tain; we have been long &s;candalized at the&s;e &s;cenes, and at the atrocious fal&s;hood of the opinion they
<PB N="46" REF="030229_0047_0FE54731F7A64AC8">
were intended to propagate; one would have hop|ed therefore, that no member of Congre&s;s, would have &s;anctioned, in any manner, however indirect, proceedings from which every well informed and hone&s;t man turns with indignation.</P>
<P>The pleadings of the coun&s;el, on the part of the pri&s;oners, which took place on the 31&s;t of Decem|are are by far too long to find a place here. It is hard|ly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that they contended for the innocence of the pri&s;oners; nor, when the read|er is informed that the defence was committed to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Tilghman</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that it was ably conducted.</P>
<P>As to the innocence of the land-jobbers, it would be wrong to &s;ay any thing po&s;itive about it, after the deci&s;ion of the Hou&s;e; but, it was not to be wondered at if <HI>men of that profe&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;hould imagine it po&s;&s;ible to bribe the members of Congre&s;s, after what they had heard of other people in the govern|ment. After having heard of the "precious con|fe&s;&s;ions" and "overtures" of Mr. Randolph, on be|half of him&s;elf and others, one would not have been &s;urprized if they had attempted to bribe the Pre&s;ident him&s;elf. They found however, other &s;ort of men to deal with. The affair terminated to the honour of the members, and I hope I may &s;ay, to the uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction of their con&s;tituents.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE RECEPTION OF THE FRENCH FLAG.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, <HI>January</HI> 5th, 1796.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I WAS rather late in my attendance this day, a circum&s;tance the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as I found, not only the gallery, but even the pa&s;&s;age al&s;o, full of &s;pectators. I, at la&s;t, made &s;hift to reach my po&s;t;
<PB N="47" REF="030229_0048_0FE54D13BB1E75E0">
but not without an infinite deal of difficulty; for, the citizens I had to deal with, being in general brim full of the doctrine of equality, pay but very little re&s;pect to old age.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on within the walls of the hou&s;e, &s;eem|ed to be waiting for the developement of &s;ome great and important my&s;tery. The members were paired off, laying their heads together, whi&s;pering and li&s;tening with great eagerne&s;s; while the Speaker, &s;eated with his chin &s;upported between his right finger and thumb, and his eyes rivetted to the floor, appeared lo&s;t, buried alive, as it were, in profun|dity of thought. Never did wi&s;dom appear more lovely in my eyes. "Two &s;uch &s;tatues," &s;aid I to my&s;elf, <Q>would have become the &s;hrine of <HI>Minerva</HI> much better than the blinking twilight mou|&s;ers, that her votaries formerly placed on it.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of the members of the Hou&s;e naturally produced the mo&s;t anxious expectation in the minds of the good citizens in my quarter. A thou&s;and ridiculous inquiries were made in the twinkling of an eye, which were an&s;wered by a thou&s;and &s;till more ridiculous conjectures. One &s;aid that a law was going to be read to oblige the Virginians to free their &s;laves and pay their ju&s;t debts; but another &s;wore that was impo&s;&s;ible. A third declared a &s;econd embargo was to be laid, and a fourth ob&s;erved, that it was to hinder the cruel Engli&s;h from carrying off our poor hor&s;es, to eat them in the We&s;t Indies. In &s;hort, were I to repeat all that I heard, I &s;hould never have done; for, of two hundred of us, no two individuals were of the &s;ame opinion. One thing, however, we all agreed in: an impatience that I &s;hould in vain endeavour to de&s;cribe, but of which the half-&s;ucce&s;sful lover, who has waited for an an&s;wer to a &s;upplicating bil|let-doux, may have &s;ome faint idea.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="030229_0049_0FE54DA8530022C0">To tell the reader the truth of my opinion, I was afraid that &s;ome new confi&s;cating or &s;eque&s;trating project was on foot; and when Mr. Dayton, the Speaker, awoke from his reverie, and began to &s;peak, "Lord have mercy," &s;aid I, <Q>upon the poor Briti&s;h creditors.</Q> My fears on this ac|count were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, for he informed the Hou&s;e, that, as he under&s;tood, a me&s;&s;age from the Pre&s;ident was about to be delivered, and I knew that the Pre&s;ident was much too hone&s;t and ho|nourable a man to think of any &s;uch thing. The Speaker told us that this me&s;&s;age was of the mo&s;t <HI>"&s;olemn"</HI> and <HI>"&s;erious"</HI> nature, and he therefore reque&s;ted both the members of the Hou&s;e and the &s;trangers in the gallery to ob&s;erve the profounde&s;t &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The reader will ea&s;ily imagine, that a warning like this increa&s;ed the torture of &s;u&s;pence. It was now that we felt the value of the hearing faculty. I ob&s;erved my neighbours bru&s;hing a&s;ide their mat|ted and untutored locks, that nothing might im|pede the entrance of the glad tidings. We were, as the poet &s;ays, "all eye, all ear." But there was a little man down below who&s;e anxiety &s;eemed to &s;urpa&s;s that of all the re&s;t. He crept to within a very few paces of the leeward &s;ide of the chair, and, turning him&s;elf &s;idewi&s;e, lifted up the left corner of his wig, placing the auricular orifice, open and extended, in a direct line with the Speaker's mouth, &s;o that not a &s;ingle breath of the precious &s;ounds could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape him. His longing countenance &s;eemed to &s;ay, in the language of his countryman Macbeth: <Q>Speak! &s;peak! had I three ears, by heaven I'd hear thee.</Q></P>
<P>The attitude of this &s;ubaltern quid nunc had like to have &s;haken the inflexibility of my mu&s;cles; I made a &s;hift, however, to mould them up into a gravity adapted to the awfulne&s;s of the &s;cene that was pre|paring
<PB N="49" REF="030229_0050_0FE54DA9E8D527D0">
for my view.&mdash;All at once, as if by the power of magic, the doors flew open, <Q>grating on their hinges har&s;h thunder,</Q> and the Pre&s;ident's Se|cretary was introduced with an American officer bearing a Flag, which I took to be a repre&s;enta|tion of the day of judgment. It had a <HI>thunder-bolt</HI> in the centre, with a <HI>cock</HI> perched upon it; the emblems of Almighty vengeance and of watchful|ne&s;s. At two of the corners the <HI>globe</HI> was repre|&s;ented in a flame. The &s;taff was covered with black velvet, &s;ad colour of death, and crowned with a Pari&s;ian pike, fatal in&s;trument, on which the bleed|ing and gha&s;tly heads, nay, even the palpitaring hearts of men, women and children have &s;o often been pre&s;ented to the view of the polite and hu|mane inhabitants of that capital.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity now gave way to another pa&s;&s;ion, that of fear. For my part, I am not a&s;hamed to con|fe&s;s, that I never was in &s;uch trepidation &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw the light of day. Nor were my companions in a more enviable &s;tate. I looked round and be|held the affrighted group huddled up together, like a brood of chickens waiting the mortal grip of the voracious kite. In this general picture of con&s;ter|nation one object attracted particular notice. It was a democrat, who was &s;o fully per&s;uaded that the Flag was the harbinger of fate, that he began to anticipate the torments of the world to come. Never did I before behold &s;uch dreadful &s;ymptoms of a guilty con&s;cience. He was as white as paper, his knees knocked together, his teeth chattered, he wrung his hands and rolled his eyes, but dur&s;t not lift them towards heaven. His voice was like the yell of the inhabitants of the infernal regions. <Q>Oh! Valerius! cur&s;ed Pittachus! Franklin Bache! Franklin Bache! Oh! that infernal athei&s;tical Ca|lendar!</Q>&mdash;This was all we could get from him;
<PB N="50" REF="030229_0051_0FE54DB1C967AF30">
but this was enough to a&s;&s;ure me, that he was one of tho&s;e unhappy wretches, who had been led a&s;tray by the profligate corre&s;pondents of Mr. Bache, and by the athei&s;tical decadery calendar, which that gentleman has, with &s;o much unholy zeal, endea|voured to introduce among&s;t us, in place of the Chri&s;|tian one, we, as yet, make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>My attention was called off from this terrific pic|ture of de&s;pair by a voice from beneath. A tall &s;pare man, dre&s;&s;ed all in black from head to foot, who &s;eemed to be <HI>"A Calm Ob&s;erver,"</HI> was begin|ning, in a hollow voice, to read (as I expected) the decrees of fate, but, to my agreeable &s;urprize, I found it was a decree of the National Convention. &mdash;It was in the following words:</P>

<P>The connections which nature, reciprocal events, and a happy concurrence of circum&s;tances, have formed between two free nations, cannot but be indi&s;&s;oluble. You have &s;trengthened tho&s;e &s;acred ties by the Declarations, which the Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the United States has made, in your name, to the National Convention and to the French People. They have been received with rap|ture by a nation, who know how to appreciate every te&s;ti|mony which the United States have given to them of their affection. The colours of both nations, united in a cen|ter of the National Convention, will be an everla&s;ting evi|dence of the part which the United States have taken in the &s;ucce&s;s of the French Republic.</P>

<P>None of the&s;e &s;ympathetic emotions have e&s;caped the &s;en&s;ibility of the French nation. They have all &s;erved to cement the mo&s;t intimate and &s;olid union that has ever ex|i&s;ted between two nations.</P>

In what hi&s;torian, I be&s;eech them, did they find out that the events of our revolution re&s;&s;embled the events of theirs? Did we begin our revolution by robbery and murder? Was our declaration of in|dependence, like their declaration of rights, pro|mulgated mid&s;t the cries of the dying? Or did the heralds &s;tand to read it under the dripping head of &s;ome innocent victim? Was our Congre&s;s ever di|vided into impious factions, &s;triving to out-vie each other in cruelty and bla&s;phemy? Did they decree the word of God to be a lie, and write over our bu|rial places: "this is the place of <HI>eternal &s;leep?</HI>" Did we ever &s;ee the guillotine permanent in our market-places; children bound beneath it, while the blood of their parents flowed on the &s;caffold; our gutters running with the &s;treams of life? Did we cut off the heads of our fathers and mothers, drag our children to death? and did the&s;e Repre&s;entatives of the French people ever hear, that our Congre&s;s ap|plauded &s;uch helli&s;h acts? Did they ever hear, that we roa&s;ted people alive, and cut off their fle&s;h to eat; that we &s;tripped poor innocent defencele&s;s wo|men, and &s;hot them by hundreds, with infants in their arms? Did they ever hear of men, born in A|merica, or in any other country except France, &s;a|vage enough to tear out the heart of a human being and bite it with their teeth; rip open women with child, and &s;tick the quivering embryo on the point of their bayonets? Is there any American ba&s;e enough to &s;ay that we were guilty of the&s;e things? And if we never were, in the name of all that's im|pudent,

how dur&s;t they thus in&s;ult us by comparing the events of our revolution to tho&s;e of their own?&mdash; Never, till I heard this di&s;patch read, did I wi&s;h for a &s;eat among the Legi&s;lators of the Union. Had I been on that floor, this hectoring epi&s;tle &s;hould ne|ver have gone into the world, without being accom|panied with a proof, that one American at lea&s;t, felt as he ought to do, the indignity offered to the character of his nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t the reader &s;hould imagine, that the horrid deeds, glanced at in this paragraph, are advanced at random, I take this opportunity of informing him, that a work, which I have had long in hand, and which will very &s;oon be pub|li&s;hed, will not only convince him, that I have never exa|gerated the cruelties of the French revolutioni&s;ts; but that I have kept far within the bounds of truth. In this work the affrighted reader will &s;ee clear convincing <HI>proofs,</HI> of &s;uch con&s;ummate villainy, &s;uch refinement in barbarity, as never before entered into the heart of the mo&s;t &s;avage but|cher of the human &s;pecies.</NOTE></P>
<P>But let us proceed to another pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;<Q>Soon did the people of the United States perceive that every victory of ours, &s;trengthened their inde|pendence and happine&s;s. They were deeply af|fected at our momentary misfortunes, occa&s;ioned by trea&s;ons purcha&s;ed by Engli&s;h gold. They have celebrated with rapture the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our brave armies.</Q></P>
<P>Now, let me a&s;k who are tho&s;e people of the Uni|ted States, that <HI>"&s;oon perceived"</HI> that what Ma&s;ter Merlin plea&s;es to call victories <HI>&s;trengthened</HI> their <HI>in|dependence</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s?</HI> For my part, I was &s;o far from perceiving this <HI>&s;oon,</HI> that I have never per|ceived it at all; no, nor even imagined either. It would be but a poor pitiful independence, I am a|fraid, were it dependent on their victories. Their victories, if we ought to call victories what has been purcha&s;ed by the ruin of an empire, have been in a
<PB N="55" REF="030229_0056_0FE54DBE6091B138">
quarter where we have neither territory nor com|mercial connections. What is their overrunning the Low Countries to us? What &s;afety can we po&s;|&s;ibly derive from their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Savoy, or their <HI>late victory on the Rhine?</HI> Had they &s;allied out, in|deed, and de&s;troyed the great <HI>Leviathan,</HI> and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for ever the liberty of the &s;eas, as they faith|fully promi&s;ed us they would, I &s;hould have li&s;tened to them; but, alas! the &s;ea-mon&s;ter &s;till rolls about, &s;weeping them from the face of the waters, when ever he meets with them. This is fine &s;trengthen|ing of our independence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is &s;omething in the very idea of an independence that &s;tands in need of the &s;trength of another nation, which, to me, appears ridicu|lous. Independence ought to imply, a capacity <HI>to &s;tand alone.</HI> If, then, we have this capacity, what need have we of French aid? And, if we have it not, we do wrong to talk about independence at all; for, a <HI>dependent independence</HI> is the mo&s;t unen|viable &s;tate into which a poor helple&s;s nation ever fell.&mdash;It is ea&s;y to di&s;cover why they are continually plying us with this old thread-bare tale; but it is not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;cover how it happens, that &s;o ma|ny among us are &s;till their dupes.</P>
<P>We now come to the "Engli&s;h Gold." They tell us, that the people of this country <Q>were deep|ly affected at their momentary misfortunes, occa|&s;ioned by trea&s;ons purcha&s;ed by Engli&s;h Gold.</Q> &mdash;This is an excellent way of accounting for mis|fortunes. When the French gain a victory, it is by their valour, but when they are beaten, it is by the gold of their enemies. There is one circum&s;tance here, which, it would &s;eem, our dear friend Mer|lin overlooked; and that is; where there are trea&s;ons there mu&s;t be traitors, and where there is corruption there mu&s;t be receivers as well as givers. This being the ca&s;e, it naturally follows, that this
<PB N="56" REF="030229_0057_0FE54DBFF4046BE8">
Engli&s;h gold has been received by corrupt French traitors. Whether this does them honour or not, or whether it be a circum&s;tance that ought to ex|cite our confidence in their nation, I leave the reader to determine.</P>
<P>But, how does this apply to our&s;elves? What have we to do with their money matters? Ah! perhaps the reader does not &s;ee why this Engli&s;h gold was glided into the flag epi&s;tle. It was not without a motive, I can a&s;&s;ure him. The writers knew that their epi&s;tle would be publi&s;hed in this country, and they looked upon it as a fine oppor|tunity to hint at Engli&s;h corruption, when the trea|ty was about to arrive among us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epi&s;tle was written in October 1794, and con&s;e|quently, they expected it would arrive here before Mr. Jay.</NOTE> They knew al|&s;o, that they had made abundant u&s;e of gold them|&s;elves, and we have ever &s;een that it is the practice of the world, to cry out on others, while the &s;in lies at their own door.</P>
<P>We have heard much talk about Engli&s;h gold, or, as it is commonly called the "gold of Pitt;" but I would venture my life, that there is not a &s;in|gle per&s;on in the United States, who believes that it has been employed among us. A proof, an infalli|ble proof, that it has not, we hear it exclaimed a|gain&s;t. Gold has a different effect: it ever makes converts: it opens the mouth of the boi&s;terous de|magogue again&s;t every body el&s;e but the donor. Had Mr. Pitt known <Q>the pretended patriots of A|merica,</Q> as well as Citizen Fauchet did; had he known that their con&s;ciences were going off dog-cheap, he might have employed a few thou&s;and guineas to good purpo&s;e. He might have bought up all the <HI>Democratic Societies</HI> in the country at the rea&s;onable rate of twenty pounds <HI>per</HI> club. The&s;e remarks may po&s;&s;ibly reach Billy Pitt; if they
<PB N="57" REF="030229_0058_0FE54DC244030DC8">
&s;hould, I hereby engage, if he will &s;end me a bank bill of ten thou&s;and pounds, to turn the hearts of all this horde of patriots in the cour&s;e of one month from the date of my receipt. I will not only &s;i|lence their execrations again&s;t him, but will turn their cerberean howlings into &s;ongs of prai&s;e. In|&s;tead of the bloody <HI>Ca Ira</HI> and the brutal <HI>Carmag|nole,</HI> I will make them bawl out, "Britannia rule the waves;" nay, even "God &s;ave Great George our King." And all this I undertake to do for the rea&s;onable commi&s;&s;ion of twenty five <HI>per cent.</HI> The reader may, perhaps, look upon this as pre|&s;umption in me; but, when he recollects that I have to do with Democratic Societies; when he recol|lects that Citizen Fauchet could have <Q>determined on <HI>civil</HI> war or on <HI>peace</HI>" with the aid of only "a few thou&s;ands of dollars,</Q> he will be ready to allow, that I could perform what I here promi&s;e with ten thou&s;and good pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>In the next &s;entence of the pa&s;&s;age above quoted, Merlin tells us, that the people of America <Q>cele|brated with rapture the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the brave French armies.</Q>&mdash;Aye, aye, and of <HI>the brave French fleets</HI> too. I wi&s;h Ma&s;ter Merlin had &s;poken as little truth here as he has done in the re&s;t of his epi&s;tle. For my part I have ever been a&s;hamed of the&s;e celebrations of the French &s;ucce&s;&s;es: they ap|peared to me to be indications of a &s;pirit of partiali|ty, very unbecoming in a people who were continu|ally putting in their claims to the rights and privi|leges of <HI>neutrality.</HI> But, let us do ju&s;tice here. Who were the&s;e civic-fea&s;ters? <Q>The people of A|merica,</Q> &s;ays Merlin; but Merlin is a little mi&s;|taken here. They were compo&s;ed of the drunken rab|ble of &s;ome great towns, headed by tho&s;e who were very probably in the pay of the Convention. I am a|ware that I &s;hall be told here, that the cannons of the
<PB N="58" REF="030229_0059_0FE54DC550145928">
State of Penn&s;ylvania were fired at the&s;e fea&s;ts, that the G. . . . . . a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on, and that <HI>honourable</HI> mention is made of him, in the <HI>proces-verbal</HI> (or minutes of the proceedings) &s;ent to the French government; but this will not make me retract what I have &s;aid about <HI>drunken rabble,</HI> nor about tho&s;e who were very probably <HI>in the pay</HI> of the Conven|tion; on the contrary, I produce this circum&s;tance as a proof of the&s;e my a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take particular notice of but one pa&s;&s;age more of this loving legi&s;lative epi&s;tle.&mdash;<Q>An analo|gy of political principles, the natural relations of commerce and indu&s;try; the efforts and im|men&s;e &s;acrifices of both nations, in the defence of liberty and equality;&mdash;the blood which they have &s;pilled together;&mdash;their avowed hatred for de&s;pots; &mdash;the moderation of their political views; the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of their councils; and e&s;pe|cially the &s;ucce&s;s <HI>of the vows which they have made in the pre&s;ence of the Supreme Being,</HI> to be free, or die,&mdash;all combine to render inde&s;tructa|ble the connections which they have formed.</Q></P>
<P>And do they tell us, that our vows to the Su|preme Being re&s;emble theirs? And have they the a&s;&s;urance to talk to us about the Supreme Being, after the publication of their decrees! Do we not know, that one of this very Convention who writes to us thus, mounted the tribune of the A&s;&s;embly, and called on them to <Q>throw down the altars of God?</Q> And, do we not know, that the Con|vention, in con&s;equence of this impious motion, de|creed, that the French people acknowledged no other god, or rather godde&s;s, but <HI>Rea&s;on?</HI> They not only in&s;tituted and celebrated a fe&s;tival to this new-fangled deity, but a <HI>&s;trumpet</HI> was accoutered in the habili|ments of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> &s;eated on a throne of turf, &s;urroun|ded with the in&s;ignia of what &s;he was &s;aid to repre|&s;ent, and in this gui&s;e received the adorations of the
<PB N="59" REF="030229_0060_0FE54DC9A29DBD78">
Convention, as well as of the people of Paris. Can we have forgotten the&s;e things? Can we have for|gotten the decree that orders all religious books to be burnt, and can we have forgotten that this was really done? Who were the men, then, that did all this? The very Convention, that now talks to us about the Supreme Being.&mdash;But, we are told, that they have now abjured their errors; that they have now <HI>decreed, that there is a God.&mdash;Decreed</HI> that there is a God! What bla&s;phemy! As if it were as ea&s;y to overturn the throne of Heavan, as that of their own country! Is there any Chri&s;tian, is there any man, that can hear language like this without &s;huddering? Are the&s;e our principles?&mdash; No: we imitate them in nothing. And I hope in God we never &s;hall.</P>

<P>A letter from the Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the French Republic, received on the 22d of la&s;t month, covered an addre&s;s dated the 21&s;t of October 1794, from the Commit|tee of Public Safety, to the Repre&s;entatives of the United States in Congre&s;s; and al&s;o informed me that he was in|&s;tructed by the Committee to pre&s;ent to the United States the colours of France.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I come to acquit my&s;elf of a duty very dear to my heart; &mdash;I come to depo&s;it in your hands and in the mid&s;t of a people ju&s;tly renowned for their courage and their love of liberty, the &s;ymbol of the triumphs and of the enfranchi&s;e|ment of my nation.</P>
<P>When &s;he broke her chains;&mdash;when &s;he proclaimed the impre&s;criptible rights of man;&mdash;when, in a terrible war, &s;he &s;ealed with her blood the covenant &s;he had made with Liberty,&mdash;her own happine&s;s was not alone the object of her glorious efforts;&mdash;her views extended al&s;o to all free peo|ple. She &s;aw their intere&s;ts blended with her own, and doubly rejoiced in her victories, which in a&s;&s;uring to her the enjoyment of her rights, became to them new <HI>guaran|tees of their independence.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, which animated the French nation, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired new &s;trength &s;ince the foundation of the Republic. France, at that time, by the form of its government, a&s;&s;imilated to, or rather indentified with, free people, &s;aw in them only friends and brothers. Long accu&s;tomed to regard the A|merican people as her mo&s;t faithful allies, &s;he has &s;ought to draw clo&s;er the ties already formed in the fields of Ame|rica, under the au&s;pices of victory, over the ruins of ty|ranny.</P>
<P>The National Convention, the organ of the will of the French nation, have more than once expre&s;&s;ed their &s;enti|ments to the American people;&mdash;but above all, the&s;e bur&s;t forth on that augu&s;t day, when the Mini&s;ter of the United States pre&s;ented to the National Repre&s;entation, the co|lours of his country. De&s;iring never to lo&s;e recollections as dear to Frenchmen as they mu&s;t be to Americans, the Convention ordered that the&s;e colours &s;hould be placed in the hall of their &s;ittings. They had experienced &s;en&s;a|tions too agreeable not to cau&s;e them to be partaken of by

their allies, and decreed that to them the National colours &s;hould be pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Mr. Pre&s;ident, I do not doubt their expectations will be fulfilled; and I am convinced that every citizen will re|ceive, with a plea&s;ing emotion, this flag, el&s;ewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty, here the certain pledge of faithful friend&s;hip; e&s;pecially when they recollect that it guides to combat, men who have <HI>&s;hared their toils,</HI> and who were prepared for liberty by <HI>aiding them to acquire their own.</HI></P>

But above all, the events of the French Revolution have produced the deepe&s;t &s;olicitude, as well as the highe&s;t admi|ration. To call your nation brave, were to pronounce but common prai&s;e. Wonderful people! Ages to come will read with a&s;toni&s;hment the hi&s;tory of your brilliant exploits! I rejoice that the period of your toils and of your immen&s;e &s;acrifices is approaching. I rejoice that the intere&s;ting re|volutionary movements of &s;o many years have i&s;&s;ued in the formation of a con&s;titution de&s;igned to give permanency to the great object for which you have contended. I re|joice that liberty, which you have &s;o long embraced with enthu&s;ia&s;m,&mdash;liberty, of which you have been the invinci|ble defenders, now finds an a&s;ylum in the bo&s;om of a re|gularly organized government;&mdash;a government, which, being formed to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of the French people, corre&s;ponds with the ardent wi&s;hes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every citizen of the United States, by its re&s;emblance to their own.&mdash;On the&s;e glorious events, accept, Sir, my &s;incere congratulations.</P>
<P>In delivering to you the&s;e &s;entiments, I expre&s;s not my own feelings only, but tho&s;e of my fellow-citizens, in rela|tion to the commencement, the progre&s;s, and the i&s;&s;ue of the French Revolution: and they will cordially join with me in

<P>THERE is nothing in this letter of the French Mini&s;ter, which &s;eems to call for a remark, after what I have &s;aid on the letter of the Committee of Public Safety, except it be the clo&s;ing &s;entence; where he tells us, that the Flag guides to combat men who have &s;hared <HI>our toils,</HI> and who were pre|pared for liberty by <HI>aiding us</HI> to <HI>acquire</HI> our own.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I &s;hall take notice of here, is, their aiding us to <HI>acquire liberty.</HI> If this be true, we knew not what liberty was before their arrival. We were, then, <HI>&s;laves</HI> to the king of Great Bri|tain. Take care, Mr. Adet; you have touched on a tender &s;tring here! What! Sir, were we &s;laves? And are we yet the <HI>&s;ons of &s;laves?</HI> If you find me one &s;ingle American (of Briti&s;h de&s;cent) who will allow, that he is the <HI>&s;on of a &s;lave,</HI> I'll give you leave to guillotine me to-morrow morn|ing, fre&s;h and fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident begins his an&s;wer by rejecting this degrading idea. "<HI>Born,</HI> Sir, <HI>in a land of liberty.</HI>" As if he had &s;aid: No, no, Sir, I am no <HI>freed man;</HI> I was never a &s;lave; I was <HI>born</HI> free.&mdash;<Q><HI>Born,</HI> Sir, in a land of liberty; having <HI>early</HI> learned its va|lue
<PB N="63" REF="030229_0064_0FE54DCCC3F8B940">
having engaged in a perilous conflict to <HI>de|fend it;</HI></Q> and not to <HI>acquire it.</HI> This is the lan|guage of every American that has too much re&s;|pect for him&s;elf and his ance&s;tors, to allow that he is no better than a freed negro. To talk of <HI>aiding us to acquire our liberty,</HI> what is it but to put us on a footing with tho&s;e deluded wretches, whom Vic|tor Hughes is now <HI>aiding to acquire their liberty</HI> at St. Vincent's and Granada?</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the <HI>aid</HI> that we received from France; there are but very few of us now-a-days who are not well convinced, that that <HI>aid</HI> was afforded from motives, that call for no mighty de|gree of gratitude; and even if we could ever have had a doubt of this, the expre&s;s declarations of the Convention would have removed it. But, &s;uppo&s;|ing the aid to have been given from motives of pure love to us, and regard to our welfare; who gave it? Not the National Convention. It was a king, whom that Convention has put to death.&mdash;The Mi|ni&s;ter tells us, that the Flag <Q>guides to combat, men who have <HI>&s;hared our toils.</HI></Q> What! did the armies of the Convention ever &s;hare our toils? I fancy we &s;hall find, that few of the men who &s;hared our toils have e&s;caped the fatal ax. Tho&s;e that did, are pining away their days in a di&s;mal dungeon, or are fled into &s;ome foreign land; nay, &s;ome of the men who &s;hared our toils, are now &s;haring the toils of the Briti&s;h, in&s;tead of the French armies.</P>
<P>Any hint of this kind might, then, have been &s;pared at the pre&s;enting of the thunder-bolt Flag; but, it &s;eems, we are never to hear the la&s;t of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from France. Not a letter, not a communication, be it ever &s;o &s;hort or &s;o trifling, do we ever receive without being reminded of it. It is a maxim, that, when once an obligation is mentioned by the obliging party, the obligation
<PB N="64" REF="030229_0065_0FE54DD574DC0350">
cea&s;es. How often, then, has our obligation cea&s;ed? "Time was," &s;ays Macbeth, <Q>when the breath was out, men cea&s;ed to exi&s;t; but now they ri&s;e from their graves with twenty mortal murders on their heads, and pu&s;h us from our &s;tools.</Q> So it is with our obligation to the French; in vain do we pay, in vain do we di&s;charge it, in vain do they forfeit all demand on us; &s;till, like the gri&s;ly gho&s;t of Bancquo, does it ri&s;e and &s;tare us in the face. I hope our children, at any rate, will have the courage to &s;ay: <Q>Shake not thy gory locks at us; thou can&s;t not &s;ay 'twas we.</Q></P>
<P>I do not know how my neighbours may think on this &s;ubject; but, for me, I cannot bear the idea of this everla&s;ting debt of gratitude. It lies like a mountain on my brea&s;t. Is it redeemable? if it be, for the love of heaven, let us pay it off, and have done with it. If I can find but ten men to join me, I'll petition Congre&s;s to lay a poll tax of an eagle an head for that purpo&s;e; that we may be able, once before we die, to &s;ay we are out of debt.</P>
<P>But, it is time to come to the manner in which the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives received the Flag, this pledge of the friend&s;hip of the Convention.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES informed the Hou&s;e, that having been aware, that the flag would be pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e this day, con&s;idering it as an additional te&s;timony of the affection of France, and it having been the practice on analogous occa&s;ions for the Hou&s;e to expre&s;s their &s;entiments inde|pendent of the other branch, he had prepared a re&s;olution expre&s;&s;ive of what he conceived would be their &s;en&s;e on the occa&s;ion. It was nearly in the words following.</P>
<P>"<HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the Pre&s;ident of the United States be reque&s;ted to make known to the Repre&s;entatives of the French People, that the Hou&s;e has received with the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ations the communication of the Committee of the Public Safety, on the 21&s;t of October 1794, accom|panied with the colours of the French Republic, and to a&s;&s;ure them that the pre&s;entation of the colours of France
<PB N="65" REF="030229_0066_0FE54DD784967FE0">
to the Congre&s;s of the United States is deemed a mo&s;t ho|nourable te&s;timony of the exi&s;ting &s;ympathy and affections of the two republics, founded upon their &s;olid and reci|procal intere&s;ts, that the Hou&s;e rejoices in the opportunity of congratulating the French Republic on the brilliant and glorious atchievements accompli&s;hed under it, during the pre&s;ent afflictive war, and that they hope tho&s;e atchieve|ments will be attended with a perfect attainment of their object, the permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the liberty and hap|pine&s;s of that great and magnanimous people."</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK wi&s;hed that a thou&s;and copies of the communications might be printed, and the farther con&s;i|deration of the me&s;&s;age deferred till to-morrow.</P>
<P>Mr. HARPER and Mr. W. Smith, al&s;o recommended a delay. In the &s;entiments of the re&s;olution, they both a|greed. Perhaps the wording might be &s;omewhat altered.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK was again&s;t po&s;tponing the con&s;idera|tion of the me&s;&s;age, and ob&s;erved that the Convention, on receiving a &s;imilar pre&s;ent from this country, had proceed|ed in&s;tantly to a vote re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Mr. W. SMITH recommended to alter the wording of the re&s;olution, by in&s;erting <HI>the executive of France,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>the repre&s;entatives of the French people,</HI> to whom the me&s;|&s;age in reply was to be directed.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERBOURNE ob&s;erved, that the difference of opi|nion re&s;pecting the branch of government to which the an&s;wer of the Hou&s;e &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed, furni&s;hed an ad|ditional rea&s;on for a po&s;tponement. He highly re&s;pected the author of the motion, and believed his own feelings on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion as fervent as tho&s;e of any member. And though the feelings of the Hou&s;e might not be as <HI>ar|dent</HI> on the morrow as at this moment, yet he pre&s;umed that the &s;entiment would be the &s;ame. He conceived that it would be more &s;atisfactory to the Republic, and more con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the Hou&s;e, that their an&s;wer &s;hould be the re&s;ult of cool deliberation, than a &s;udden im|pul&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion was calcu|lated to in&s;pire. He would therefore move that the farther con&s;ideration of the re&s;olution on the table, be po&s;tponed till to-morrow.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK thought a po&s;tponement in this ca&s;e, as in many others, would only be a wa&s;te of time. The mo|tion
<PB N="66" REF="030229_0067_0FE54DD9152EDDE8">
was negatived. Mr. W. Smith's amendment was then taken up, and, after &s;ome conver&s;ation, was al&s;o negatived.</P>
<P>Mr. PARKER moved an amendment as follows: "That this Hou&s;e has received with the mo&s;t <HI>&s;incere and</HI> lively &s;en|&s;ibility," &amp;c. The amendment was for in&s;erting the two words in Italicks, to which the Hou&s;e con&s;ented. The me&s;&s;age was then voted unanimou&s;ly, and a thou&s;and co|pies of the communications and re&s;olutions were ordered to be printed. A committee of two members was ap|pointed to wait on the Pre&s;ident, and inform him of the re|&s;olution agreed to by the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>OH, fy! Mr. Sedgwick! how could you propo&s;e to put off the con&s;ideration of this charming &s;ub|ject till the next day? A delay of a whole twenty-four hours! Upon my word, Sir, &s;uch a propo&s;i|tion indicated but little regard for our Si&s;ter Re|public. How different the conduct of Mr. Giles! He comes to the Hou&s;e with a <HI>re&s;olution</HI> in his poc|ket, ready prepared, even before the communica|tion is received. Happy member! He has thus got the &s;tart of you all in the affections of our very dear allies. Mr. Parker made, indeed, a pu&s;h to come in with him, by adding the word <HI>&s;incere;</HI> but we all know, that the fir&s;t &s;tep is every thing in like ca&s;es.&mdash;<HI>Sincere</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> are not, 'tis true, the propere&s;t epithets that could be placed before the word <HI>&s;en&s;ibility;</HI> but it would be mere pedantry to &s;ubject to rules of propriety, a re&s;olution dicta|ted by that <Q>&s;udden impul&s;e of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> which the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion was calculated to in&s;pire.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK (don't &s;mile reader) &s;aw, at once, the impropriety of po&s;tponing the con&s;idera|tion; becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e what!&mdash;becau&s;e <Q>the Con|vention, on receiving a &s;imilar <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> from <HI>this country,</HI> had proceeded in&s;tantly to a vote re&s;|pecting it.</Q>&mdash;And who told you, my dear little orator, that <Q>the Convention had received a &s;imi|lar
<PB N="67" REF="030229_0068_0FE54DDB5CC3BD30">
<HI>pre&s;ent</HI> from <HI>this country?</HI></Q>&mdash;Who is <HI>this coun|try?</HI> What is it? I am well informed that neither the government nor the legi&s;lature knew any thing at all about the matter, 'till an account of it appear|ed in the news-papers; and you are not to learn, I pre&s;ume, that whatever an Emba&s;&s;ador does of his own head, is in no wi&s;e binding on his country. But, &s;uppo&s;e even, that the American flag deliver|ed to the Convention, had been a pre&s;ent from this country, their manner of receiving it could have but little weight here, with men who were not de|voted to their intere&s;ts rather than to tho&s;e of Ame|rica. How long, I pray, have their mea&s;ures be|came precedents here? <Q>They proceeded to a vote in&s;tantly.</Q> And when did they do otherwi&s;e? When did they he&s;itate? When they decreed that each department &s;hould <HI>build a &s;hip of the line,</HI> there was no he&s;itation, any more than when they de|creed that there &s;hould be <HI>no more beggars</HI> in France, and <HI>no more kings</HI> in Europe. Be&s;ides, if you are to imitate the Convention, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, you mu&s;t make a very con&s;iderable change in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. You mu&s;t have half a dozen ne|groes and mulattoes among&s;t you; and it would have been nece&s;&s;ary, the day before the reception of this pretty pre&s;ent, for your Speaker to receive and embrace an old negro woman at the head of her many-coloured progeny. Even the ceremony it&s;elf mu&s;t have undergone a change; for the Ame|rican flag was carried to the Convention by an <HI>A|merican;</HI> con&s;equently the French flag &s;hould have been brought in by a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> and, if the imi|tation was to be perfect in all its parts, your Speaker &s;hould have de&s;cended from his &s;eat, and given this bearer the fraternal hug. How vain, then, was it to talk about imitations. Before you a&s;pire to this &s;ublime perfection in patrioti&s;m, you and your
<PB N="68" REF="030229_0069_0FE54D043A162DA0">
party mu&s;t rai&s;e us to the height of the French peo|ple; a change more ea&s;y to attempt than accom|pli&s;h, whatever you may plea&s;e to think of it.</P>
<P>As I have already taken up &s;o much of the rea|der's time with this flag, I &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent, enter into an inquiry whether it was proper, or not, to make the Pre&s;ident of the United States a &s;ort of go-between to the Congre&s;s and the Con|vention; nor &s;hall I a&s;k how the American Em|ba&s;&s;ador at Paris came to think of involving his government in &s;uch an affair; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, as I believe it is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies &s;ending pre&s;ents to each other, &s;o, I hope, it will be the la&s;t.</P>
