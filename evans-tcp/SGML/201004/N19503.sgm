<P>"THE neglect of the ri&s;ing ge|neration, which &s;o general|ly prevails, ought, &s;urely, to a|waken our &s;erious concern for it; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that the pre|&s;ent attempt will be welcome to all who are duly impre&s;&s;ed with that concern; for, &s;o far as I am capa|ble of judging, it is well adapted to an&s;wer its intended purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>"As the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;ermons is no matter of controver&s;y, but plain and important duty, one would hope, they will not fall un|der the &s;evere cen&s;ure of any. At lea&s;t I am fully per&s;uaded that hum|ble and &s;erious chri&s;tians, who&s;e chief concern is to know, and do their duty, will find agreeable en|tertainment and much profitable in&s;truction, in the peru&s;al of them."</P>

<P>IT is a mo&s;t amiable and in&s;tructive part of the character which <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> draws of <HI>the great Shepherd</HI> of the church, that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould <HI>gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bo&s;om:</HI> A repre&s;entation abundantly an&s;wered by the tender care which our Redeemer expre&s;&s;ed for the weake&s;t of his di&s;ciples; and beautifully illu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ted by the endearing conde&s;cen&s;ion, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich he embraced and ble&s;&s;ed little infants.

purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that when he recom|mends to Peter the care of his flock, as the mo&s;t important and acceptable evidence of his &s;incere affection to his per&s;on, he varies the phra&s;e; in one place, &s;aying, <HI>feed my &s;heep,</HI> and in the other, <HI>feed my lambs.</HI> Perhaps it might be intended in part to intimate, that the care of a go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, who would in the mo&s;t agreeable manner approve his love to his ma&s;ter, &s;hould extend it&s;elf to the ri&s;ing genera|tion, as well as to tho&s;e of a maturer age, and more con&s;iderable &s;tanding in the church. It is in obedience to his autho|rity, and from a regard to his intere&s;t; that I am now entering on the work of ca|techi&s;ing, which I &s;hall introduce with &s;ome practical di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>on the education of children,</HI> the &s;ubject which is now be|fore us.</P>
<P>I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that you, my friends, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to hear, that I intend to handle it at large, and to make it the employment of more than a &s;ingle Sabbath. A little reflection may convince you, that I could hardly offer any thing to your con|&s;ideration of greater importance; and that, humanly &s;peaking, there is nothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in which the comfort of families, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">+rity of nations, the &s;alvation of &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intere&s;t of a Redeemer, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="7" REF="025410_0006_0FCCE3395569FAB8">
GOD, is more apparently and intimately concerned.</P>
<P>I very readily allow, that no human en|deavours, either of mini&s;ters or parents, can ever be effectual to bring one &s;oul to the &s;aving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST, without the co-operating and transforming influences of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit: Yet you well know, and I hope you &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;i|der, that this does not in the lea&s;t weaken our obligation to the mo&s;t diligent u&s;e of proper means. The great GOD hath &s;tated rules of operation in the world of grace, as well as of nature; and though he is not li|mited to them, it is arrogant, and may be de&s;tructive, to expect that he &s;hould devi|ate from them in favour of us or our's.</P>
<P><HI>We live not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD:</HI> and were he determined to conti|nue your lives, or the lives of your chil|dren, he could no doubt feed or &s;upport you by miracle: Yet you think your&s;elves obliged to a prudent care for your daily bread, and ju&s;tly conclude that were you to neglect to admini&s;ter it to your infant off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pring, you would be chargeable with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> murder before GOD and man; nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you think of pleading it as any ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> that you referred them to a miracu|lous, divine care, whil&s;t you left them de|&s;titute
<PB N="8" REF="025410_0007_0FCCE33A574E6670">
of any human &s;upplies. Such a plea would only add impiety to cruelty, and greatly aggravate the crime it attempted to palliate. As ab&s;urd would it be for us, to flatter our&s;elves with a hope that our chil|dren &s;hould be taught of GOD, and regen|erated and &s;anctified by the influences of his grace, if we neglect that prudent and religious care in their education, which it is my bu&s;ine&s;s this day to de&s;cribe and re|commend, and which Solomon urges in the words of my text: <HI>Train up a child in the way in which he &s;hould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I need not offer you many critical re|marks on &s;o plain and intelligible a pa&s;&s;age. You will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that it con&s;i&s;ts of an important advice, addre&s;&s;ed to the par|ents and governors of children. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go;</HI> and al&s;o of a weighty rea&s;on by which it is inforced, <HI>and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>The general &s;en&s;e is undoubtedly retain|ed in our tran&s;lation, as it commonly is: but here, as in many other places, &s;ome|thing of the original energy and beauty is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word, which we rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>train up,</HI> does &s;ometimes &s;ignify, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> general, to initiate into &s;ome &s;cience or
<PB N="9" REF="025410_0008_0FCCE362D658B400">
di&s;cipline; and very frequently, to apply any new thing to the u&s;e for which it was intended. It is e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pecially u&s;ed of &s;acred things, which were &s;olemnly dedicated, or &s;et apart to the &s;ervice of GOD: And per|haps it may here be intended to intimate, that a due care is to be taken in the educa|tion of children, from a principle of reli|gion, as well as of prudence and humanity; and that our in&s;tructions &s;hould lead them to the knowledge of GOD, and be adapted to form them for his &s;ervice, as well as to engage them to per&s;onal and &s;ocial virtue.</P>
<P>It is added, that a child &s;hould be train|ed up <HI>in the way in which he &s;hould go;</HI> which &s;eems to be more exactly rendered by others, at the entrance or from the be|ginning of his way, to expre&s;s the early care which ought to be taken to prevent the prevalency of irregular habits, by en|deavouring, from the fir&s;t dawning of rea|&s;on, to direct it aright, and to infu&s;e into the tender unpracti&s;ed mind, the important maxim of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>To encourage us to this care, the Wi&s;e Man a&s;&s;ures us, that we may rea&s;onably expect the mo&s;t happy con&s;equence from it: That if the young traveller be thus di|rected to &s;et out well in the journey of life, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> is a fair pro&s;pect that he will go on to its mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;tages with increa&s;ing
<PB N="10" REF="025410_0009_0FCCE3646BBC1B20">
honour and happine&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate and inforce this important advice in the following me|thod, which appears to me the mo&s;t natur|al, and for that rea&s;on the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall more particularly mark out the way in which children are to be trained up.</P>
<P N="2">II. Offer &s;ome plain and &s;erious con&s;i|derations to awaken you to this pious and nece&s;&s;ary care.</P>
<P N="3">III. Direct to the manner in which the attempt is to be made, and the precautions which are to be u&s;ed in order to render it effectual. And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. I will conclude the whole with a more particular application, &s;uited to your different characters, relations, and circum|&s;tances of life.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that it is a very deli|cate as well as important &s;ubject, which is now before me; I have therefore thought my&s;elf obliged more attentively to weigh what has occurred to my own meditations, more diligently to con&s;ult the &s;entiments of others, and above all, more earne&s;tly to &s;eek tho&s;e divine influences, without which I know, I am unequal to the ea&s;ie&s;t ta&s;k&punc;
<PB N="11" REF="025410_0010_0FCCE365DBA69148">
but in dependance on which, I chearfully attempt one of the mo&s;t difficult. The re|&s;ult of the whole I humbly offer to your candid examination; not pretending at a|ny time to dictate in an authoritative man|ner, and lea&s;t of all on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this; but rather &s;peaking as to wi&s;e men, who are them&s;elves to judge what I &s;ay.&mdash; May the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ing at|tend us in all!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am to de&s;cribe the way in which children are to be trained up.</P>
<P>Our tran&s;lation, as I have told you, though not very literal, is agreeable to the &s;en&s;e of the original, <HI>The way in which the child &s;hould go.</HI> And undoubtedly this is no other, than the good old way; the way of &s;erious practical religion: The way which GOD has in his word marked out for us; the way which all the children of God have trodden in every &s;ucceeding age; the way, the only way, in which we and our's can find re&s;t to our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>But it is not proper to leave the matter thus generally explained. I would there|fore more particularly ob&s;erve&mdash;that it is the way of piety towards GOD&mdash;and of fairly in our Lord JESUS CHRIST;&mdash;the way of obedience to parents, and of bene|volence to all&mdash;the way of diligence, and of integrity; the way of humility, and of
<PB N="12" REF="025410_0011_0FCCE36751E22BB8">
&s;elf-denial. I am per&s;uaded, that each of the&s;e particulars will de&s;erve your &s;erious attention and regard.</P>
<P N="1">1. Children &s;hould undoubtedly be trained up in the way of piety and devotion towards GOD.</P>
<P>This, as you well know, is the &s;um and the foundation of every thing truly good. <HI>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wi&s;dom.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t therefore invites children to him, with the promi&s;e of in|&s;tructing them in it; <HI>Come, ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</HI> And it is certain, &s;ome right notions of the &s;upreme Being mu&s;t be implanted in the minds of chil|dren, before there can be a rea&s;onable foundation for teaching them tho&s;e doc|trines which peculiarly relate to CHRIST under the character of the Mediator; for he who comes unto GOD (by him) mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is the re|warder of them who diligently &s;eek him.</P>
<P>The proof of the Being of GOD, and &s;ome of tho&s;e attributes of the divine nature in which we are mo&s;t concerned, depends on &s;uch ea&s;y principles, that I cannot but think, the weake&s;t mind might enter into it. A child will ea&s;ily apprehend, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="13" REF="025410_0012_0FCCE369DFB493C0">
every hou&s;e is built by &s;ome man, and there can be no work without an author; &s;o <HI>he that built all things is GOD.</HI> And from this obvious idea of GOD, as the ma|ker of all, we may naturally repre&s;ent him as very great and very good, that they may be taught at once to reverence and love him.</P>
<P>It is of great importance, that children early imbibe an awe of GOD, and an hum|ble veneration for his perfections and glo|ries. He ought therefore to be repre&s;ented to them as the great LORD OF ALL; and when we take occa&s;ion to mention to them other invi&s;ible agents, whether Angels or devils, we &s;hould, as Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> has mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, always repre&s;ent them as entirely under the government and con|troul of GOD, that no &s;entiments of admi|ration of good &s;pirits, or terror of the bad, may di&s;tract their tender minds, or in|fringe on tho&s;e regards which are the in|communicable prerogative of the GREAT SUPREME.</P>
<P>There &s;hould be a peculiar caution, that when we teach the&s;e infant tongues to pro|nounce that great and terrible name, THE LORD OUR GOD, they may not learn to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it in vain; but may u&s;e it with a be|coming &s;olemnity, as remembering that we and they are <HI>but du&s;t and a&s;hes before him.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="025410_0013_0FCCE36B1DD3D570">
When I hear the little creatures &s;peaking of "the great GOD, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, the glorious GOD," as I &s;ometimes do, it gives me a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, and I con&s;ider it as a probable proof of great wi&s;dom and piety, in tho&s;e who have the charge of their educa|tion.</P>
<P>Yet great care &s;hould be taken not to confine our di&s;cour&s;es to the&s;e awful views, lea&s;t the dread of GOD &s;hould &s;o fall upon them, as that his excellencies &s;hould make them afraid to approach him. We &s;hould de&s;cribe him, as not only the greate&s;t, but the be&s;t of beings. We &s;hould teach them to know him by the mo&s;t encouraging name of <HI>the LORD, the LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and a|bundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, and forgiving iniquity, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in.</HI> We &s;hould repre&s;ent him as the univer&s;al, kind, indulgent parent, who loves his creatures, and by all proper methods provides for their happine&s;s. And we &s;hould particularly repre&s;ent his goodne&s;s to them; with what more than parental tenderne&s;s, he watched round their cradles; with what compa&s;&s;ion he heard their feeble cries, before their infant thoughts could form them&s;elves into pray|er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; We &s;hould tell them that they live eve|ry m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment on GOD; and that all our affec|tion
<PB N="15" REF="025410_0014_0FCCE36CCB077C80">
for them, is no more than he puts in|to our hearts; and all our power to help them, no more than he lodges in our hands.</P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o &s;olemnly remind them, that in a very little while their &s;pirits are to return to this GOD; that as he is now al|ways with them, and knows every thing they do, or &s;peak, or think, &s;o he will bring every work into judgment, and make them for ever happy or mi&s;erable, as they on the whole are found obedient or rebel|lious. And here the mo&s;t lively and pa|thetic de&s;criptions, which the &s;criptures give us, of heaven and of hell, &s;hould be laid before them, and urged on their con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>When &s;uch a foundation is laid, in the belief of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being and providence of GOD, and of a future &s;tate both of rewards and puni&s;hments, children &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the duty they owe to GOD, and &s;hould be particularly taught to pray to him and to prai&s;e him. It would be be&s;t of all, if from a deep &s;en&s;e of his perfections, and their own nece&s;&s;ities, they could be engag|ed to breath out their &s;ouls before him in words of their own, were they ever &s;o weak and broken. Yet you will readily allow, that till this can be expected, it may be very proper to teach them &s;ome form of
<PB N="16" REF="025410_0015_0FCCE36E6FA6AB60">
prayer and thank&s;giving, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch plain &s;criptures, or other familiar expre&s;|&s;ions, as may be&s;t &s;uit their circum&s;tances and under&s;tandings. If the Lord's Prayer be taught them, as a form, I hope you will con&s;ider how comprehen&s;ive the ex|pre&s;&s;ions are; how fa&s;t the ideas ri&s;e and vary; and con&s;equently how nece&s;&s;ary it is, that it be frequently and largely ex|plained to them; le&s;t the repetition of it degenerate into a mere ceremony, as I fear it does among many, who are perhaps mo&s;t zealous for its u&s;e.</P>
<P>But what I have &s;aid, on this head, of piety and devotion, mu&s;t be con&s;idered in an in&s;eparable connection with what I am to add under the next.</P>
<P N="2">2. Children mu&s;t be trained up in the way of faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>You know, my friends, and I hope ma|ny of you know it to the daily joy of your &s;ouls, that CHRIST is the way, the truth, and the life; and that it is by him we have boldne&s;s and acce&s;s with confidence to a GOD, who might otherwi&s;e appear as a con&s;uming fire. It is therefore of great importance to lead children betimes into the knowledge of CHRIST, which is, no doubt, a con&s;iderable part of that nurture
<PB N="17" REF="025410_0016_0FCCE36FA161D278">
and admonition of the Lord, which the Apo&s;tle recommends, and was perhaps what he principally intended by tho&s;e words.</P>
<P>We &s;hould therefore teach them betimes, that the fir&s;t parents of the human race, mo&s;t ungratefully rebelled again&s;t GOD, and &s;ubjected them&s;elves and all their off|&s;pring to his wrath and cur&s;e. The awful con&s;equences of this &s;hould be opened at large, and we &s;hould labour to convince them, that they have made them&s;elves lia|ble to the divine di&s;plea&s;ure (that dreadful thing!) by their own per&s;onal guilt; and thus by the knowledge of the law &s;hould we make way for the go&s;pel, the joyful news of deliverance by CHRIST.</P>
<P>In unfolding this, great care ought to be taken that we do not fill their minds with an aver&s;ion to one Sacred Per&s;on, while we endeavour to attract their regards to another. The FATHER is not to be re|pre&s;ented as &s;evere, and almo&s;t inexorable; hardly prevailed upon by the interce&s;&s;ion of his compa&s;&s;ionate SON to entertain thoughts of mercy and forgivene&s;s. Far from that, we &s;hould &s;peak of him as the overflowing fountain of goodne&s;s, who&s;e eye pitied us in our helple&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e almighty arm was &s;tretched out for our re&s;|cue, who&s;e eternal coun&s;els of wi&s;dom and
<PB N="18" REF="025410_0017_0FCCE3712D7E4168">
love formed that important &s;cheme to which we owe all our hopes. I have often had occa&s;ion to &s;hew you at large, that this is the &s;cripture doctrine; our children &s;hould be early taught it, and taught what that &s;cheme was, &s;o far as their under|&s;tandings can receive it, and our's can ex|plain it. We &s;hould often repeat it to them, that GOD is &s;o holy, and yet &s;o gra|cious, that rather than he would on the one hand de&s;troy man, or on the other leave &s;in unpuni&s;hed, he made his own &s;on a &s;acrifice for it, appointing him to be humbled, that we might be exalted, to die, that we might live.</P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o repre&s;ent to them (with holy wonder and joy) how readily the Lord Je&s;us con&s;ented to procure our deliverance in &s;o expen&s;ive a way. How chearfully he &s;aid, <HI>Lo, I come! I delight to do thy will, O my GOD!</HI> To enhance the value of this amazing love, we &s;hould endeavour, ac|cording to our weak capacities, to teach them who this compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer is; to repre&s;ent &s;omething of his glories as the eternal SON of GOD, and the great Lord of angels and men. We &s;hould in&s;truct them in his amazing conde&s;cen&s;ion in lay|ing a&s;ide the&s;e glories, that he might be|come a little, weak, helple&s;s child, and af|terwards an afflicted&punc; &s;orrowful man. We
<PB N="19" REF="025410_0018_0FCCE37352A210B8">
&s;hould lead them into the knowledge of tho&s;e circum&s;tances of the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us, which may have the greate&s;t tendency to &s;trike their minds, and to impre&s;s them with an early &s;en&s;e of gratitude and love to him. We &s;hould tell them, how poor he made him&s;elf, that he might enrich us; how diligently he went about doing good; how willingly he preached the go&s;pel to the lowe&s;t of the people. And we &s;hould e&s;pecially tell them how kind he was to lit|tle children, and how he chid his di&s;ciples when they would have hindered them from being brought to him: It is expre&s;sly &s;aid, JESUS <HI>was much di&s;plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, &s;uffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of GOD.</HI> A tender circum&s;tance! which perhaps was recorded (in part at lea&s;t) for this very rea&s;on, that children in &s;ucceeding ages might be impre&s;&s;ed and affected with it.</P>
<P>Through the&s;e &s;cenes of his life we &s;hould lead them on to his death: We &s;hould &s;hew how ea&s;ily he could have deli|vered him&s;elf (of which he gave &s;o &s;en&s;ible an evidence, in &s;triking down by one word, tho&s;e who came to apprehend him;) and yet how patiently he &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t cruel injuries, to be &s;courged and &s;pit upon, to be crowned with thorns, and to bear the cro&s;s.

this innocent, holy, divine per&s;on was <HI>brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter;</HI> and while they were piercing him with nails, in&s;tead of loading them with cur&s;es, he prayed for them, &s;aying, <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</HI> And when their little hearts are awed and melted with &s;o &s;trange a &s;tory, we &s;hould tell them, it was thus he groaned, and bled, and died for us, and often remind them of their own concern in what was then tran&s;|acted.</P>
<P>We &s;hould lead on their thoughts to the glorious views of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion; and tell them with what adora|ble goodne&s;s he &s;till remembers his people in the mid&s;t of his exaltation; pleading the cau&s;e of &s;inful creatures, and employing his intere&s;t in the court of heaven, to pro|cure life and glory for all who believe in him, and love him.</P>
<P>We &s;hould then go on to in&s;truct them in tho&s;e particulars of obedience, by which the &s;incerity of our faith and our love is to be approved; at the &s;ame time reminding them of their own weakne&s;s, and telling them how GOD helps us, by &s;ending his holy SPIRIT to dwell in our hearts, to fur|ni&s;h us for every good word and work.

which our in&s;truction will be vain, and their hearing will likewi&s;e be vain!</P>
<P N="3">3. Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of obedience to their parents.</P>
<P>This is a command which GOD recom|mended from Mount Sinai, by annexing to it a particular promi&s;e of long life; a ble&s;|&s;ing which young per&s;ons greatly de&s;ire. The Apo&s;tle therefore ob&s;erves, that it is <HI>the fir&s;t commandment with promi&s;e,</HI> i. e. a command eminently remarkable for the manner in which the promi&s;e is adjoined. And it is certainly a wi&s;e con&s;titution of Providence, that gives &s;o much to parental authority, e&s;pecially while children are in their younger years, their minds being then incapable of judging and acting for them|&s;elves in matters of importance. Children &s;hould therefore be early taught and con|vinced by &s;cripture, that GOD has commit|ted them into the hands of their parents; and con&s;equently that reverence and obedi|ence to their parents, is a part of the duty they owe to GOD, and di&s;obedience to them, is rebellion again&s;t him. And par|ents &s;hould by no means indulge their chil|dren in a direct and re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to their will in matters of greater or &s;maller moment; remembering, that a child left
<PB N="22" REF="025410_0021_0FCCE3781E6D4A98">
to him&s;elf, brings his parents to &s;hame, and him&s;elf to ruin; and with regard to &s;ub|jection, as well as affection, <HI>it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of benevolence and kindne&s;s to all.</P>
<P>The great Apo&s;tle tells us that <HI>love is the fulfilling of the law,</HI> and that all tho&s;e branches of it, which relate to our neigh|bour, are comprehended in that one word, <HI>love.</HI> This love therefore we &s;hould endea|vour to teach them; and we &s;hall find, that in many in&s;tances it will be a law to it|&s;elf; and guide them right in many parti|cular actions, the obligations to which may depend on principles of equity, which lie far beyond the reach of their feeble under|&s;tandings. There is hardly an in&s;truction relating to our duty more happily adapted to the capacity of children, than that golden law (&s;o important to all of the mature&s;t age) <HI>What&s;oever ye would that others &s;hould do unto you, do ye &s;o unto them.</HI> This rule we &s;hould teach them, and by this &s;hould examine their actions. From their cradles we &s;hould often inculcate it upon them, that a great deal of religion con&s;i&s;ts in do|ing good; that <HI>the wi&s;dom from above is full of mercy and good fruits;</HI> and that eve|ry
<PB N="23" REF="025410_0022_0FCCE37960053C30">
chri&s;tian <HI>&s;hould do good unto all as he has opportunity.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;uch in&s;tructions may be welcome to them, we &s;hould endeavour, by all pru|dent methods, to &s;often their hearts to &s;en|timents of humanity and tenderne&s;s, and guard again&s;t every thing that would have a contrary tendency. We &s;hould remove from them as much as po&s;&s;ible, all kinds of cruel and bloody &s;pectacles, and &s;hould carefully di&s;courage any thing barbarous in their treatment of brute creatures; by no means allowing them to &s;port them&s;elves in the death or pain of dome&s;tic animals, but rather teaching them to treat the poor creatures kindly, and take care of them; the contrary to which is a mo&s;t dete&s;table &s;ign of a &s;avage and malignant di&s;po&s;ition. The merciful <HI>man regardeth the life of his bea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould likewi&s;e take care to teach them the odiou&s;ne&s;s and folly of a &s;elfi&s;h temper, and encourage them in a willing|ne&s;s to impart to others, what is agreeable and entertaining to them&s;elves: E&s;pecially we &s;hould endeavour to form them to &s;enti|ments of compa&s;&s;ion for the poor. We &s;hould &s;hew them where GOD has &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that con&s;idereth the poor, the LORD will remember him in the day of trouble. He that hath pity upon the poor,
<PB N="24" REF="025410_0023_0FCCE37AE24289D0">
lendeth to the LORD and that which he hath given, will he pay him again.</HI> And we &s;hould &s;hew them by our own practices, that we verily believe the&s;e promi&s;es to be true, and important. It might not be im|proper &s;ometimes to make our children the me&s;&s;engers, by which we &s;end &s;ome &s;mall &s;upply to the indigent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and if they di&s;cover a di&s;po&s;ition to give &s;ome|thing out of the little &s;tock we allow them to call their own, we &s;hould joyfully en|courage it, and &s;hould take care that they never lo&s;e by their charity, but that in a prudent manner we abundantly repay it. It is hardly to be imagined that children thus brought up &s;hould, in the advance of life, prove injurious and oppre&s;&s;ive; they will rather be the ornaments of religion, and ble&s;&s;ings to the world, and probably will be in the number of the la&s;t whom Pro|vidence will &s;uffer to want.</P>
<P N="5">5. Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of diligence.</P>
<P>This &s;hould undoubtedly be our care, if we have any regard to the welfare either of their bodies or their &s;ouls. In whatever &s;tation of life they may at length be fixed, it is certain there is little pro&s;pect of their acquitting them&s;elves with u&s;efulne&s;s, hon|our
<PB N="25" REF="025410_0024_0FCCE37D427DD528">
and advantage, without a clo&s;e and re|&s;olute application; whereas the wi&s;e&s;t of princes and of men has &s;aid, <HI>See&s;t thou a man diligent in his bu&s;ine&s;s? he &s;hall &s;tand before kings, he &s;hall not &s;tand before mean men.</HI> And it is evident that a diligent pro|&s;ecution of bu&s;ine&s;s keeps one out of the way of a thou&s;and temptations, which idle|ne&s;s &s;eems to invite, leading a man into numberle&s;s in&s;tances of vice and folly, be|cau&s;e he has nothing el&s;e to do.</P>
<P>A prudent and religious parent will therefore be concerned, that his children may not early contract &s;o pernicious a ha|bit, nor enter upon life, like per&s;ons who have no bu&s;ine&s;s in it, but to crowd the &s;tage, and &s;tand in the way of tho&s;e who are better employed.&mdash;In&s;tead of &s;uffering them to &s;aunter about from place to place (as abundance of young people do, to no imaginable purpo&s;e of u&s;efulne&s;s, or even of entertainment) he would quickly a&s;&s;ign them &s;ome employment for their time: An employment &s;o moderated, and &s;o diver&s;i|fied, as not to overwhelm and fatigue their tender &s;pirits; yet &s;ufficient to keep them wakeful and active. Nor is this &s;o difficult as &s;o many imagine; for children are a bu|&s;y kind of creatures, naturally fond of learning new things, and trying and &s;hew|ing what they can do. So that, I am per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="26" REF="025410_0025_0FCCE37F54CF1E30">
were perfect inactivity to be im|po&s;ed on them as a penance but for one hour, they would be heartily weary of it, and would be glad to &s;eek their refuge from it, in almo&s;t any bu&s;ine&s;s you would think fit to employ them about.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hould they be di&s;ciplined in their infant years, &s;hould early be taught the va|lue of time, and early accu&s;tomed to im|prove it, till they grow fit for &s;ome calling in life; in which they &s;hould at length be placed with this important maxim deeply engraven upon their minds, "That full employ in whatever &s;ervice they are fixed, is a thing by no means to be dreaded, but on the contrary, greatly to be de&s;ired."</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this head with the men|tioning of a very remarkable law among&s;t the Athenians, which ordained, "That tho&s;e who had been brought up to no em|ployment by their parents, &s;hould not be obliged to keep them, if they came to want in their old age; which all other (legiti|mate) children were."</P>
<P N="6">6. Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of integrity.</P>
<P>Simplicity and godly &s;incerity is not on|ly a very amiable, but an e&s;&s;ential part of the chri&s;tian character; and we are every
<PB N="27" REF="025410_0026_0FCCE380F13B8400">
one of us indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to prove our&s;elves <HI>I&s;raelites indeed, in whom there is no</HI> allowed <HI>guile.</HI> And this is a cir|cum&s;tance which will peculiarly require our regard in the education of our chil|dren, and of all young per&s;ons under our care.</P>
<P>It is very melancholy to ob&s;erve, how &s;oon the artifices and deceits of corrupt na|ture begin to di&s;cover them&s;elves. In this re&s;pect we are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the womb, and go a&s;tray almo&s;t as &s;oon as we are born, &s;peaking lies. Great care there|fore &s;hould be taken to form the minds of children to a love for truth and candor, and a &s;en&s;e of the meanne&s;s as well as the guilt of a lie. We &s;hould be cautious that we do not expo&s;e them to any temptations of this kind, either by unrea&s;onable &s;eve|rities, on account of little faults, or by ha&s;ty &s;urprizes, when enquiring into any matter of fact, which it may &s;eem their in|tere&s;t to di&s;gui&s;e by a fal&s;ehood: And when we find them guilty of a known and deli|berate lie, we &s;hould expre&s;s our horror of it, not only by a pre&s;ent reproof or correc|tion, but by &s;uch a conduct towards them for &s;ome time afterwards, as may plainly &s;hew them how greatly we are amazed, grieved, and di&s;plea&s;ed. When &s;o &s;olemn a bu&s;ine&s;s is made of the fir&s;t faults of this
<PB N="28" REF="025410_0027_0FCCE38340B5BF58">
kind, it may be a mean of preventing ma|ny more.</P>
<P>I will further add, that we ought not on|ly thus &s;everely to animadvert upon a di|rect lie, but likewi&s;e, in a proper degree, to di&s;courage all kinds of equivocations and double meanings, and tho&s;e little tricks and artifices, by which they may endeavour to impo&s;e on each other, or on tho&s;e who are older than them&s;elves. We &s;hould often inculcate upon them that excellent &s;crip|ture, <HI>He that walketh uprightly walketh &s;urely; but he that perverteth his way,</HI> (that twi&s;ts and di&s;torts it with the per|plexities of artifice and deceit) <HI>&s;hall</HI> (at length) <HI>be known.</HI> Be &s;hewing them every day, how ea&s;y, how plea&s;ant, how hon|ourable, and how advantageous it is to maintain a fair, open, hone&s;t temper; and on the other hand, what folly there is in cunning and di&s;hone&s;ty in all its forms; and how certain it is, that by &s;tudying and practi&s;ing it, they take the readie&s;t way to make them&s;elves obnoxious and u&s;ele&s;s, in|famous and odious. Above all, &s;hould we remind them, that the righteous LORD loved righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his favourable countenance beholds the upright; but ly|ing lips are &s;uch an abomination to him, that he expre&s;sly declares, <HI>All liars &s;hall
<PB N="29" REF="025410_0028_0FCCE385554FFA78">
have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of humility.</P>
<P>This is a grace which our Lord particu|larly invites us to learn of him, and mo&s;t frequently recommends to us; well know|ing that without it, &s;o humbling a &s;cheme as he came to introduce, would never meet with a welcome reception. And with re|gard to the pre&s;ent life, it is a mo&s;t lovely ornament, which engages univer&s;al e&s;teem and affection; &s;o that before honour is hu|mility: On the whole we find, <HI>He that ex|alteth him&s;elf is aba&s;ed, and he that humbleth him&s;elf is exalted,</HI> both by GOD and man.</P>
<P>A regard therefore to the ea&s;e, honour and happine&s;s of our children, &s;hould en|gage us to an early endeavour of checking that pride, which was the fir&s;t &s;in, and the ruin of our natures; and diffu&s;es it&s;elf &s;o wide, and &s;inks &s;o deep, into all who draw their original from degenerate Adam. We &s;hould teach them to expre&s;s humility and mode&s;ty in their conver&s;e with all.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be taught to treat their &s;u|periors with peculiar re&s;pect, and &s;hould at proper &s;ea&s;ons be accu&s;tomed to &s;ilence and re&s;erve before them. Hence they will learn
<PB N="30" REF="025410_0029_0FCCE386F8761230">
in &s;ome degree the government of the tongue; a branch of wi&s;dom, which, in the advance of life, will be of great import|ance to the quiet of others, and to their own comfort and reputation.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould they be allowed to a&s;&s;ume airs of in&s;olence towards their equals; but ra|ther be taught to yield, to oblige, and to give up their right for the &s;ake of peace. To this purpo&s;e I cannot but think it de&s;ir|able, that they &s;hould be generally accu&s;|tomed to treat each other with tho&s;e forms of civility and complai&s;ance, which are u&s;ual among well-bred people in their rank of life. I know the&s;e things are mere trifles in them&s;elves, yet they are the out-guards of humanity and friend&s;hip, and effectually prevent many a rude attack, which, taking its ri&s;e from &s;ome little circum&s;tances, may neverthele&s;s be attended with fatal con&s;e|quences. I thought it proper to mention this here, becau&s;e (as <HI>Scougal</HI> very ju&s;tly and elegantly expre&s;&s;es it) "The&s;e modes are the &s;hadows of humility, and &s;eem in|tended to &s;hew our regard for others, and the low thoughts we have of our&s;elves."</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add farther, that it is great imprudence and unkindne&s;s to children, to indulge them in a haughty and imperious behaviour towards tho&s;e who are mo&s;t their inferiors. They &s;hould be made to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="31" REF="025410_0030_0FCCE3896B32BF10">
that the &s;ervants of the family are not <HI>their</HI> &s;ervants, nor to be under <HI>their</HI> go|vernment and controul. I the rather in&s;i&s;t upon this, becau&s;e I have generally ob&s;erv|ed, that where young people have been permitted to tyrannize over per&s;ons in the lowe&s;t circum&s;tances of life, the humour has &s;hamefully grown upon them, till it has diffu&s;ed in&s;olence and arrogance through their behaviour to all about them.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Children &s;hould be trained up in the way of &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>As without &s;omething of this temper we can never follow CHRIST, or expect to be owned by him as his di&s;ciples; &s;o neither indeed can we pa&s;s comfortably through the world. For whatever unexperienced youth may dream, a great many di&s;ta&s;teful and mortifying circum&s;tances will occur in life, which will unhinge our minds almo&s;t every hour, if we cannot manage, and in many in&s;tances deny our appetites, our pa&s;&s;ions, and our humours. We &s;hould therefore endeavour to teach our children this important le&s;&s;on betimes; and if we &s;ucceed in our care, we &s;hall leave them abundantly richer and happier, in this rule and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own &s;pirits, than the
<PB N="32" REF="025410_0031_0FCCE38AAA59BC60">
mo&s;t plentiful e&s;tates, or the mo&s;t unlimit|ed power over others could make them.</P>
<P>When a rational creature becomes the &s;lave of appetite, he &s;inks beneath the dig|nity of the human nature, as well as the &s;anctity of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. It is therefore ob&s;ervable that when the Apo&s;tle mentions the three grand branches of prac|tical religion, he puts &s;obriety in the front; perhaps to intimate, that where that is ne|glected, the other cannot be &s;uitably re|garded. <Q>The Grace of God, <HI>(i. e. the go&s;pel)</HI> teaches us to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;|ly, and godly.</Q> Children therefore, as well as young men, &s;hould be exhorted to be &s;oberminded:&mdash;And they &s;hould be taught it by early &s;elf-denial. It is certain, that if their own appetite and ta&s;te were to determine the kind and quantity of their food, many of them would quickly de&s;troy their con&s;titutions, and perpaps their lives; &s;ince they have often the greate&s;t de&s;ire for tho&s;e things which are the mo&s;t improper. &mdash;And it &s;eems ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by a very wi&s;e man, (who was him&s;elf a melancholy in&s;tance of it) <Q>That the fondne&s;s of mo|thers for their children, in letting them eat and drink what they will, lays a foun|dation for mo&s;t of tho&s;e calamities in hu|man life, which proceed from bodily in|di&s;po&s;ition.</Q> Nay, I will add, that it is
<PB N="33" REF="025410_0032_0FCCE38C131521C0">
the part of wi&s;dom and love, not only to deny what would be unwhole&s;ome, but to guard again&s;t indulging them in too great a nicety either of food or dre&s;s, people of &s;en&s;e cannot but &s;ee, if they would plea&s;e to con&s;ider it, that to know how to fare plainly, and &s;ometimes a little hardly, car|ries a man with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure through many circum&s;tances of life, which to luxu|ry and delicacy would be almo&s;t intolera|ble.</P>
<P>The government of the pa&s;&s;ions is an|other branch of &s;elf-denial, to which chil|dren &s;hould early be habituated; and &s;o much the rather becau&s;e, in an age when rea&s;on is &s;o weak, the pa&s;&s;ions are apt to appear with peculiar force and violence. A prudent care &s;hould therefore be taken to repre&s;s the exorbitances of them.&mdash;For which purpo&s;e, it is of great importance, that they never be &s;uffered to carry any point, by ob&s;tinacy, noi&s;e and clamour, which is indeed to be&s;tow a reward on a fault which de&s;erves a &s;evere reprimand. Nay, I will venture to add, that though it be very inhuman to take plea&s;ure in mak|ing them unea&s;y by needle&s;s mortifications, yet when they are eagerly and intemperate|ly de&s;irous of a trifle, they ought, for that very rea&s;on, &s;ometimes to be denied it, to teach them more moderation for the fu|ture.
<PB N="34" REF="025410_0033_0FCCE38D91995F00">
And if by &s;uch methods, they gra|dually learn to conquer their little humours and fancies, they learn no incon&s;iderable branch of true fortitude and wi&s;dom. I cannot expre&s;s this better, than in the words of Mr. Locke, in his excellent trea|ti&s;e on the &s;ubject before us; <Q>He that has found out the way to keep a child's &s;pirit ea&s;y, active and free, and yet at the &s;ame time to re&s;train him from many things which he has a mind to, and draw him to things unea&s;y to him, has got the true &s;ecret of education.</Q></P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes been &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, how far a &s;en&s;e of honour and prai&s;e has carried &s;ome children of a generous temper in a long and re&s;olute cour&s;e of &s;elf denial. But undoubtedly, the noble&s;t principle of all is a &s;en&s;e of religion. Happy would it indeed be, if they were led to &s;ee, that there is but very little in this kind of grati|fications and indulgences; that the world it&s;elf is but a poor empty trifle; and that the great thing a rational creature &s;hould be concerned about, is to plea&s;e GOD, and get well to heaven. May divine grace teach us this important le&s;&s;on for our&s;elves, that we may tran&s;mit it with the greater advantage to our children! AMEN.</P>

<P>IT is certainly a very plea&s;ing reflection to every faithful mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, that the cau&s;e, in which he is engaged, is the mo&s;t benevolent, as well as the mo&s;t religi|ous; &s;ub&s;erving the glory of GOD, by pro|moting the happine&s;s of mankind.

Though the paper on which we would write the knowledge of GOD be not entire|ly fair, it is clear of many a foul in&s;cription and deep blot, with which it would &s;oon be covered. Though the garden, in which we would plant the fruits of holine&s;s, be not free from weeds, yet many of them are but (as it were) in the invi&s;ible &s;eed, and the re&s;t are not grown up to that luxuriant &s;ize, which we mu&s;t expect, if due culti|vation be omitted or delayed.</P>
<P>It is a farther advantage which de&s;erves to be mentioned here, that infancy and childhood is the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ible age; and as principles are then mo&s;t ea&s;ily admitted, &s;o they are mo&s;t firmly retained. The an|cients, tho&s;e judicious ob&s;ervers of human nature, as well as many modern writers, are full of this remark in their di&s;cour&s;es on education, and illu&s;trate it by a great many beautiful allu&s;ions which are well known.</P>

Mo&s;aic oeconomy, GOD urged it on his people in a very affecting manner? Surely you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, how &s;trictly GOD charges it upon the Jews to take all oppor|tunities to this purpo&s;e, occa&s;ional as well as &s;tated. <HI>The&s;e words,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thine heart; and thou &s;halt teach them diligently to thy chil|dren, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> And el&s;ewhere, <HI>thou &s;halt teach them to thy &s;ons, and thy &s;ons &s;ons.</HI> Plainly recommending a care of more re|mote, as well as immediate de&s;cendants of grand-children, as well as children.

We acknowledge, that he &s;ometimes leaves tho&s;e who have been, as it were, born and brought up in his family, to for&s;ake it in a very &s;candalous manner; while he &s;eems to go into the territories of &s;atan; into ig|norant, carnal, prophane families, and takes from thence per&s;ons, whom he erects as trophies of free, &s;urpri&s;ing, and (as Mr. Howe ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it) "unaccountable grace."

Solomon, no doubt, had ob&s;erved, that a good education had generally been &s;ucce&s;sful, or we could by no means account for the remark in the text; and a very accurate writer of our own age and nation has carried it &s;o far as to &s;ay, "That of all the men we meet with, nine parts in the ten are what they are, good or bad, u&s;eful or not, according to their education."</P>

Almighty grace can indeed do it; and almighty power can of the&s;e &s;tones, on which we tread, rai&s;e up children to Abraham. But &s;hew me your warrant from the word of GOD for expecting it, ei|ther in the one ca&s;e, or in the other.

<PB N="53" REF="025410_0052_0FCCE6A8D8B0D0E8">
done to them by his fault: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd how &s;olici|tous is he before he dies to petition the king for favour to his children! How earne&s;tly does he charge his friends to be careful of them, and kind to them!" We are tho&s;e traitors. Our children have derived from us a tainted blood, a forfeited Inheritance. How tenderly &s;hould we pity them! How &s;olicitou&s;ly &s;hould we exert our&s;elves to prevent their ruin! Mr. Flavel expre&s;&s;es the thought &s;till more pathetically. "Should I bring the plague into my fami|ly, and live to &s;ee all my poor children lie dying by the walls of my hou&s;e; if I had not the heart of a tyger, &s;uch a &s;ight would melt my very &s;oul." And &s;urely, I may add, were there a &s;overeign antidote at hand, perhaps an antidote I had my&s;elf u&s;|ed, &s;hould I not direct them to it, and urge them to try it, I &s;hould be &s;till more &s;avage and criminal. The application <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ea&s;y: The LORD deeply impre&s;s it on your &s;ouls, that your dear children may not die eternally of the malignant plague they have taken from you!</P>
<P>This is one con&s;ideration, which &s;hould certainly add a great deal of weight to the argument I am now upon. I will conclude the head with the mention of another: I mean, the peculiar advantages which you their parents have for addre&s;&s;ing your&s;elves

to them. You, who have known them from their infancy, are be&s;t acquainted with their temper, and manner of think|ing; you, who are daily with them, may watch the mo&s;t tender moments, the mo&s;t favourable opportunities of pleading with them; your melting affection for them, will &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t endearing &s;entiments and words on &s;uch occa&s;ions: Their obli|gations to you, and love for you, will pro|bably di&s;po&s;e them to attend with the great|er plea&s;ure to what you may &s;ay; or your authority over them, your power of correc|tion, and a &s;en&s;e of their dependance upon you in life, may prevent much of that op|po&s;ition and contempt, which from per|ver&s;e tempers, others might expect, e&s;pe|cially if they were not &s;upported by your concurrence, in their attempts to in&s;truct and reform your children.</P>
<P>On the whole then, &s;ince your obliga|tions and your encouragements to attempt the work are &s;o peculiar, I may rea&s;onably hope you will allow its due weight to this &s;econd con&s;ideration, that the character and conduct of your children, and con|&s;equently your care in their education, is of the highe&s;t importance to their pre|&s;ent and future happine&s;s. I add, once more,</P>

<P>If you have rea&s;on to hope that your la|bours are not in vain, but that your chil|dren are become truly religious; it mu&s;t greatly increa&s;e your &s;atisfaction in them, that they are dear to you, not only in the bands of the fle&s;h, but in tho&s;e of the LORD.

Little do they or you think how much agony and di&s;tre&s;s you may endure, from what you will &s;ee, and what you will fear concerning them. How many &s;lighted admonitions, how ma|ny deluded hopes, how many anxious days, how many re&s;tle&s;s nights, will con|cur, to make the evening of life gloomy! And at length, when GOD gives you a di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from a world, which the folly and wickedne&s;s of your children has &s;o long imbittered, how painful will the &s;eparation be; when you have the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing them but once more, and that at the tribu|nal of GOD, where the be&s;t you can expect (in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tance) is to ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t them, and to bear an

I am fully per|&s;uaded, that if you knew the weight with which the&s;e things will &s;it upon your mind, in the immediate views of the eternal world, you would not &s;uffer every trifling difficul|ty, or little care, to deter you from the di&s;|charge of tho&s;e duties, which are &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent the&s;e galling reflections.</P>
<P>To conclude: Let me intreat you &s;eri|ou&s;ly to weigh the united force of tho&s;e ar|guments, which I have now been urging to excite your diligence in this momentuous care of training up your children in the way in which they &s;hould go. Con&s;ider how plea&s;ant the attempt is: Con&s;ider how fair a probability there is that it may pro&s;per, as it is in it&s;elf a very rational method, as it is a method GOD has appointed, and a me|thod which he has crowned with &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s: Con&s;ider how important that &s;uc|ce&s;s

<P>THOSE of you, who have made any ob&s;ervation on human life, mu&s;t certainly know, that if we de&s;ire to be agreeable and u&s;eful in it, we mu&s;t rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not only the quality, but the manner of our actions; and that while we are in the pur&s;uit of any important end, we mu&s;t not only attend to tho&s;e actions which do im|mediately refer to it, but mu&s;t watch over the whole of our conduct; that we may pre&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tency in the &s;everal parts of it.

<P>The&s;e will relate&mdash;partly to the manner in which the attempt is to be made&mdash;and partly to the precautions nece&s;&s;ary for ren|dering it effectual: Which are, as you &s;ee, matters of di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, though comprehended under the general head of directions.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the manner in which the attempt is to be made.</P>
<P>And here it is evident, it &s;hould be done plainly, &s;eriou&s;ly, tenderly and pa|tiently.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="025410_0061_0FCCE6B79F126C08">1. Children are to be in&s;tructed plainly: In the plaine&s;t things, and by the plain|e&s;t words.</P>
<P>They are to be taught the plaine&s;t things in religion in the fir&s;t place. And it is a plea&s;ing reflection on this occa&s;ion, that according to the abundant goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the great GOD, tho&s;e things which are the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary are the plaine&s;t. Ju&s;t as in the world of nature, tho&s;e kinds of food, which are mo&s;t whole|&s;ome and nouri&s;hing, are al&s;o the mo&s;t common. We &s;hould &s;hew our grateful &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s in this particu|lar, by our care to imitate it; and &s;hould &s;ee to it, that when the nece&s;&s;ities of our children require bread, we do not give them a &s;tone, or chaff; as we &s;hould do, if we were to di&s;tract their feeble minds with a variety of human &s;chemes, and doubtful di&s;putations. The more ab&s;tru&s;e and my&s;terious truths of the go&s;pel are gra|dually to be unfolded, as they are exhibited in the oracles of GOD, and to be taught in the language of the &s;pirit; according to the excellent advice of the great Dr. Owen, "making &s;cripture phra&s;eology our rule and pattern in the declaration of &s;piritual things. But we mu&s;t not begin here. We mu&s;t feed them with milk while they
<PB N="63" REF="025410_0062_0FCCE6B92237D788">
are babes, and re&s;erve the &s;trong meat for a maturer age. Take the mo&s;t obvious and vital truths of chri&s;tianity. Tell them, that they are creatures, and &s;inful crea|tures; that by &s;in they have di&s;plea&s;ed a holy GOD; and that they mu&s;t be pardon|ed, and &s;anctified, and accepted in CHRIST, or mu&s;t peri&s;h for ever. Shew them the difference between &s;in and holine&s;s; be|tween a &s;tate of nature and of grace. Shew them, that they are ha&s;tening on to death and judgment, and &s;o mu&s;t enter on heaven or hell, and dwell for ever in the one or the other. Such kind of le&s;&s;ons will pro|bably turn to the be&s;t account, both to them and you. I know it is a very ea&s;y thing to inflame the warm, ignorant minds of children with an eager zeal for di&s;tin|gui&s;hing forms, or di&s;tingui&s;hing phra&s;es; and to make them violent in the intere&s;t of a party, before they know any thing of common chri&s;tianity. But if we thus &s;ow the wind, we &s;hall probably reap the whirl|wind; venting our&s;elves, and transfu&s;ing into them, a wrath of man, which never works, but often greatly ob&s;tructs the righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, this is not the fault of you, my friends, of this congregation. I would mention it with great thankfulne&s;s, as both your happine&s;s and mine, that &s;o far as I can judge, it is
<PB N="64" REF="025410_0063_0FCD26C495B5C128">
the &s;incere milk of the word that you de|&s;ire. Let it be your care to draw it out for the nouri&s;hment of your children's &s;ouls, as their under&s;tandings and capacities will permit them to take it in.</P>
<P>And while you are teaching them the plaine&s;t things, endeavour to do it in the plaine&s;t words. It is the gracious method which GOD u&s;es with us, who &s;peaks to us of heavenly things in language, not fully expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ublimity and grandeur of the &s;ubject, but rather &s;uited to our feeble apprehen&s;ions. Thus our LORD taught his di&s;ciples, as they were able to bear it; and u&s;ed ea&s;y and familiar &s;imilitudes, ta|ken from the mo&s;t obvious occurrences in life, to illu&s;trate matters of the highe&s;t im|portance. A mo&s;t in&s;tructive example! Such conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;hould we u&s;e, in training up tho&s;e committed to our care, and &s;hould examine whether we take their under&s;tandings along with us, as we go on: Otherwi&s;e we are &s;peaking in an un|known tongue; and as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;|&s;es it, are barbarians unto them, be our language ever &s;o grateful, elegant or pathe|tic.</P>
<P>Give me leave to add, for the conclu&s;ion of this head, that though it is to be taken for granted, that children in their earlie&s;t infancy are to be engaged to what is good,
<PB N="65" REF="025410_0064_0FCD26C615F402A8">
and to be re&s;trained from evil, chiefly by a view to rewards and puni&s;hments, more immediate or remote, or by &s;ome natural workings of a benevolent affection, which are by all means to be cheri&s;hed and culti|vated; yet, as they may grow up to greater ripene&s;s of under&s;tanding, &s;omething far|ther is to be attempted. It mu&s;t then be our care, to &s;et before them in the &s;tronge&s;t light, the natural beauties of holine&s;s, and deformities of &s;in; and likewi&s;e to propo&s;e, in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t familiar way, the evidences of the truth of chri&s;tianity, that they may be fortified again&s;t tho&s;e tempta|tions to infidelity, with which the pre&s;ent age does &s;o unhappily abound. The exter|nal evidences of it are by no means to be &s;lighted, &s;uch as the credibility of the go&s;|pel hi&s;tory, the accompli&s;hment of prophe|cies, the unity of de&s;ign carried on by &s;o many different per&s;ons in di&s;tant ages and countries, its amazing and even miracu|lous propagations in the world; all which, with many other con&s;iderations to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, are very judiciou&s;ly handled in a variety of excellent writings of our own age: of which I know not any more &s;uited to your u&s;e, than Mr. Bennet's di&s;cour&s;es on the in&s;piration of &s;cripture, which I therefore recommend to your attentive pe|ru&s;al; and with them Dr. <HI>Watts'</HI> &s;ermons
<PB N="66" REF="025410_0065_0FCD26C877B513F0">
on the inward witne&s;s to the truth of chri&s;|tianity, from its efficacious tendency to promote holine&s;s: This appears to me the noble&s;t evidence of all, and will to tho&s;e who have actually experienced it, be an an|chor of the &s;oul both &s;ure and &s;tead fa&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Children &s;hould be in&s;tructed in a ve|ry &s;erious manner.</P>
<P>There is an unhappy pronene&s;s in our degenerate natures to trifle with the things of GOD; and the giddine&s;s of childhood is peculiarly &s;ubject to it. Great care &s;hould therefore be taken, that we do not encour|age &s;uch an humour, nor teach them by our levity or indolence in the manner of our in&s;truction, to take the awful name of GOD in vain, while they are &s;peaking of him, or to him. For this purpo&s;e we mu&s;t la|bour with our own hearts, to work them to a deep and &s;erious &s;en&s;e of the truth and importance of what we &s;ay: This will give us an unaffected &s;olemnity in &s;peaking, which will probably command the atten|tion, and impre&s;s the hearts of our chil|dren. Endeavour to pre&s;erve on your own &s;pirit, an habitual awe of the great and ble&s;&s;ed GOD, the LORD of heaven and earth: that when you &s;peak of him to tho&s;e little creatures, they may evidently &s;ee the
<PB N="67" REF="025410_0066_0FCD26C9CE3AC2E0">
indications of the humble&s;t veneration and reverence, and &s;o may learn to fear him from their youth. When you &s;peak of CHRIST, let your &s;ouls be bowing to him as the &s;on of GOD, through whom alone you and your's can obtain pardon and life; and let them be overflowing with love to him, for his unutterable and inconceivable grace. And when you remind them of death, judgment and eternity, con&s;ider your&s;elves and them as dying creatures: Think in how few months, or weeks, or days, your lips may be &s;ilent in the du&s;t, or they may be for ever removed beyond the reach of your in&s;tructions; and plead with them in as earne&s;t and importunate a man|ner, as if the &s;alvation of their immortal &s;ouls depended on the effect of the pre&s;ent addre&s;s. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. Children &s;hould be in&s;tructed in a ve|ry tender and affectionate manner.</P>
<P>We &s;hould take care to let them &s;ee, that we do not de&s;ire to terrify and amaze them, to lead them into unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everi|ties, or to deprive them of any innocent plea&s;ures; that what we &s;ay is not dictated by an o&s;tentation of our wi&s;dom and autho|rity; but that it all proceeds from a hearty love to them, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire of their
<PB N="68" REF="025410_0067_0FCD26CB4BF412E8">
happine&s;s. Study therefore to addre&s;s them in the mo&s;t endearing language, as well as with the &s;ofte&s;t and &s;weete&s;t ar|guments. Endeavour, according to the practice of Solomon, to find out acceptable words. And if tears &s;hould ari&s;e while you are &s;peaking do not &s;uppre&s;s them. There is a language in them, which may perhaps affect beyond words. A weeping parent is both an awful and a melting &s;ight.</P>
<P>Endeavour therefore to look upon your children in &s;uch a view, as may be mo&s;t likely to awaken the&s;e tender &s;entiments. Con&s;ider them as creatures, whom you (as in&s;truments) have brought into being, tainted with innate corruption, &s;urrounded with &s;nares, and on the whole, in &s;uch ap|parent danger, that if not &s;natched as brands out of the burning, they mu&s;t per|i&s;h for ever. And that your hearts may be further mollified, and that you may be formed to the mo&s;t gentle and moving man|ner of addre&s;s, let me intreat you to &s;tudy the &s;cripture in this view, and to ob&s;erve the conde&s;cending and endearing forms in which the ble&s;&s;ed GOD &s;peaks to us there. Ob&s;erve them for your&s;elves, and point them out to your children. Tell them, how kindly he has demanded, how graci|ou&s;ly he has encouraged their &s;ervices; while he &s;ays, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in
<PB N="69" REF="025410_0068_0FCD26CEAA5CC9A0">
the days of thy youth;</HI> and el&s;ewhere, <HI>I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me ear|ly &s;hall find me.</HI> Tell them that the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath invited them to come to him; for he has &s;aid, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t: Him that cometh unto me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out: And who&s;oever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</HI> Such &s;criptures as the&s;e &s;hould be often re|peated to them, and &s;hould be early incul|cated on their memory, with an attempt, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to let them into the &s;pirit and force of them.</P>
<P>Nor will it be improper &s;ometimes to &s;et before them, how much you have done, how much you are ready to do for them; how many anxious thoughts you entertain, how many &s;ervent prayers you offer on their account. Thus Lemuel's mother ad|dre&s;&s;ed him, <HI>What, my &s;on? and what, the &s;on of my womb? and what, the &s;on of my vows?</HI> As if &s;he had &s;aid, <Q>My dear child, for whom I have borne &s;o much, for whom I have prayed &s;o earne&s;tly; in what words &s;hall I addre&s;s thee, to ex|pre&s;s what my heart feels on thy ac|count? How &s;hall I &s;peak my affectionate overflowing concern for thy happine&s;s both for time and eternity?</Q> So Solo|mon pleads, <HI>My &s;on, if thine heart be wi&s;e,

You mu&s;t not imagine, my friends, that a plentiful harve&s;t will &s;pring up in a day.

you have once taught them; repeat it a &s;e|cond time; and if they forget it the &s;econd time, repeat it the third. It is thus the great GOD deals with you; and you have daily rea&s;on to rejoice that he does. He knows the frailty and weakne&s;s of your minds, and therefore acts by a rule, which &s;eems to be laid down with a peculiar re|gard to the very point I am urging: <HI>Whom &s;hall he teach knowledge, and whom &s;hall he make to under&s;tand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the brea&s;ts? For precept mu&s;t be upon precept, precept upon precept, and line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little:</HI> As if he &s;hould have &s;aid, "GOD has treated you like little children, who mu&s;t have the &s;ame &s;hort ea&s;y le&s;&s;on repeated again and again." And is it not indeed thus with regard to you? Does not the pa|tience and conde&s;cen&s;ion of your heavenly Father &s;end to you his mini&s;ters, Sabbath after Sabbath, frequently inculcating the &s;ame things, that what you have forgot may be brought to mind again? Thus &s;hould you do by tho&s;e committed to your care.</P>
<P>Be teaching them every Sabbath: That is remarkably a good day for the purpo&s;e. Then you have lei&s;ure for it; then you have particular advantage to pur&s;ue the

work; then you are furni&s;hed with &s;ome new matter by what you have heard in public; and I would hope your &s;pirits are then quickened by it, &s;o that you can &s;peak out of the abundance of your heart; and you may, by di&s;cour&s;ing with them on what has been addre&s;&s;ed to you, receive the impre&s;&s;ion on your own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I add, be teaching them every day, by occa&s;ional di&s;cour&s;es, when you have not an opportunity of doing it by &s;tated addre&s;|&s;es. Drop a word for GOD every day, and often in a day. You will probably find your account in it, and your children theirs. A &s;udden glance of thought to|wards GOD in the mid&s;t of the world, is often a great refre&s;hment to the chri&s;tian; and a &s;udden turn to &s;omething &s;erious and &s;piritual in conver&s;ation, is frequently very edifying to others. It &s;trikes the memory and the heart, and is, perhaps, as a nail fixed in a &s;ure place, when many a &s;olemn admonition, and many an elaborate &s;ermon is lo&s;t. It is with plea&s;ure that I frequently hear good chri&s;tians &s;peaking of &s;uch occa|&s;ional hints, which have been dropped by &s;aints of the former generation: Tho&s;e tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;ages, which the pious parents might forget in a few moments, their chil|dren have di&s;tinctly remembered for many future years, and repeated for their own

edification, and I might add for mine. Let this therefore be an encouragement to you; and in this re&s;pect, in the morning &s;ow this precious &s;eed, and in the evening withhold not your hand, &s;ince you know not whe|ther &s;hall pro&s;per, or whether both &s;hall be alike good.</P>
<P>Once more, let me intreat you to repeat your pious in&s;tructions and admonitions, even though your children &s;hould grow up to years of maturity, without appear|ing to profit by them. Say not, that you can teach them no more than they already know; or, that you can try no new me|thod which you have not already attempt|ed. You &s;ee, that in our a&s;&s;emblies, GOD often brings back &s;ouls to him&s;elf by &s;et|ting home on the con&s;cience truths, which, with regard to the &s;peculative part of them, they know as well as their teachers; and adds a divine efficacy to tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which, for a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, they had attended in vain. Be not therefore weary in well-doing; but let patience, in this in&s;tance, have its perfect work.</P>
<P>Thus let your children be in&s;tructed plainly, &s;eriou&s;ly, tenderly, and patiently; I wave &s;ome other particulars, which I might have added to the&s;e, concerning the manner of in&s;tructing them, becau&s;e I ap|prehend they will more properly fall under

<P>Here I would particularly advi&s;e, that a prudent care be taken to keep up your au|thority over them, and at the &s;ame time to engage their affections to you; that you be &s;olicitous to keep them out of the way of temptation; that you confirm your admo|nitions by a &s;uitable example; that you cheerfully accept of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tances in this important attempt; and that you humbly and con&s;tantly look up to GOD for his ble&s;&s;ing on all.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we de&s;ire to &s;ucceed in our at|tempts for the religious education of our children, we mu&s;t take care to keep up our authority over them.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t avoid, not on|ly what is gro&s;sly vicious and criminal (which will more properly be mentioned under a following head) but al&s;o tho&s;e lit|tle levities and follies which might make us appear contemptible to them. What|ever
<PB N="75" REF="025410_0074_0FCD26D80CD09BF0">
liberties we may take with tho&s;e who are our equals in age and &s;tation, a more exact decorum is to be pre&s;erved before our children. Thus we are to reverence them, if we de&s;ire they &s;hould reverence us; for, as Dr. Tillot&s;on very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "There is a certain freedom of conver&s;a|tion, which is only proper among equals in age and quality, which if we u&s;e before our &s;uperiors, we &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e them; and if we do it before our inferiors, we teach them to de&s;pi&s;e us."</P>
<P>I will not in&s;i&s;t on this hint, which your own prudence mu&s;t accommodate to parti|cular circum&s;tances; but &s;hall here intro|duce the mention of correction, which in &s;ome ca&s;es may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of parental authority, e&s;pecial|ly where admonitions and coun&s;els are &s;lighted.</P>
<P>You know, that the &s;criptures expre&s;sly require it on proper occa&s;ions; and Solo|mon, in particular, enlarges on the head. and &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome important thoughts with regard to it. Fooli&s;hne&s;s (&s;ays he) is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction &s;hall drive it far from him. Nay, he &s;peaks of it as a matter in which life is concerned, even the life of the &s;oul: Withhold not correction from a child; for if thou beat him with the rod, he &s;hall not

die: Thou &s;halt beat him with the rod, and &s;halt deliver his &s;oul from hell. And is it kindne&s;s, or cruelty, in a parent, to &s;pare the fle&s;h to the hazard of the &s;oul? Parents are therefore exhorted to an early care in this re&s;pect, le&s;t vicious habits growing inveterate &s;hould render the at|tempt vain or hurtful; and they are cauti|oned again&s;t that fooli&s;h tenderne&s;s, which would lead them to regard the tears of a child, rather than his true&s;t and highe&s;t in|tere&s;t. <HI>Correct thy &s;on while there is hope, and let not thy &s;oul &s;pare for his crying: He that &s;pareth the rod, hateth his &s;on; but he that loveth him, cha&s;teneth him betimes.</HI> Nor can we imagine a more lively commen|tary on the words than the melancholy &s;to|ry of Eli, who, though he was a very emi|nent &s;aint in a degenerate age, yet erred here, and by a fatal indulgence brought ruin, as well as infamy, on him&s;elf and his family. He reproved the abominable wickedne&s;s of his &s;ons; but did not make u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;evere methods, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e the authority of a parent might have warranted, and the office of a judge did undoubtedly require. Ob&s;erve the &s;en|tence which GOD pronounced again&s;t him for it, and which he executed upon him in a very awful manner. The LORD &s;aid un|to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in I&s;|rael,
<PB N="77" REF="025410_0076_0FCD26DD4C546EE0">
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it &s;hall tingle: In that day I will perform again&s;t Eli all things which I have &s;poken concerning his hou&s;e; when I begin, I will al&s;o make an end. For I have told him that I will judge his hou&s;e for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth; becau&s;e his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile, and he re&s;trained them not: And therefore I have &s;worn unto the hou&s;e of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's hou&s;e &s;hall not be purged with &s;acrifice nor offering for ever. Take heed, I entreat you, as you love your chil|dren, as you love your&s;elves, that it may not be &s;aid of you, that your's have made them&s;elves vile, and you have neglected to re&s;train them. Let mothers, in particular take heed, that they do not, as it were, &s;mother their children in their embraces; as a French author &s;martly expre&s;&s;es it. And let me remind you all particularly to be cautious, that the arms of one parent, be not a refuge to the children from the re|&s;entment of the other. Both &s;hould appear to act in concert, or the authority of the one will be de&s;pi&s;ed, and probably the in|dulgence of the other abu&s;ed, and the mu|tual affection of both endangered.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, that I enlarge on this &s;ub|ject with plea&s;ure; but how could I have an&s;wered for the omi&s;&s;ion of what is &s;o copi|ou&s;ly
<PB N="78" REF="025410_0077_0FCCE2F34A826248">
and &s;o pathetically inculcated in the &s;acred writings?

Take heed, that your corrections be not too frequent, or too &s;evere&mdash;and that they be not given in an unbecoming manner.</P>
<P>If your corrections be too frequent, it will probably &s;poil much of the &s;ucce&s;s. Your children, like iron, will harden un|der repeated &s;trokes; and that ingenious &s;hame will be gradually worn off, which adds the greate&s;t &s;ting to what they &s;uffer from a parent's hand. And there will be this farther inconvenience attending it, that there will not be a due difference made, between great and &s;mall faults. The laws of Draco the Athenian, were ju&s;tly rejected, becau&s;e they puni&s;hed all crimes alike, and made the &s;tealing of an apple capital, as well as the murder of a ci|tizen. You, on the contrary, &s;hould let your children &s;ee, that you know how to

<P>Nor &s;hould your corrections at any time be too &s;evere. It is prettily &s;aid by Dr. Tillot&s;on on this occa&s;ion, "That whips are not the cords of a man:" They &s;hould be u&s;ed in a family, only (as the &s;word in the republic) as the la&s;t remedy when all others have been tried in vain; and then &s;hould be &s;o u&s;ed, as that we may appear to imitate the compa&s;&s;ion of our heavenly Fa|ther, who doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</P>
<P>Which leads me to add, that we &s;hould be greatly cautious, that correction be not inflicted in an unbecoming manner: and it always is &s;o, when it is given in a pa&s;&s;ion. A parent's correcting his child &s;hould be regarded as an act of dome&s;tic ju&s;tice, which therefore &s;hould be admini&s;tered with a due &s;olemnity and decorum; and to behave otherwi&s;e on the occa&s;ion, is almo&s;t as great an indecency, as for a judge to pa&s;s &s;entence in a rage. It is injurious to our|&s;elves, as it tends to &s;poil our own temper; for peevi&s;hne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion will grow upon us, by being indulged towards tho&s;e who dare not oppo&s;e them: And it is on many accounts injurious to our children.

But if once they imagine, that you cha&s;ti&s;e them merely to vent your pa&s;&s;ion, and gra|tify your re&s;entment, they will &s;ecretly de&s;|pi&s;e, and perhaps hate you for it: In that in&s;tance at lea&s;t, they will look upon you as their enemies, and may, by a continued cour&s;e of &s;uch &s;everities, contract &s;uch an aver&s;ion, not only to you, but to all that you recommend to them. Thus you may lo&s;e your authority and your influence, by the very method you take to &s;upport it, and may turn a whole&s;ome, though bitter medicine, into poi&s;on.

I ob&s;erved under a former head, that you &s;hould addre&s;s them in an affec|tionate manner when di&s;cour&s;ing on reli|gious &s;ubjects; but now I add, that you &s;hould carry the temper through life, and be daily endeavouring to render your&s;elves amiable to them. The Apo&s;tle cautions parents that they &s;hould not provoke their children to wrath, if they would bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD: On the contrary, you &s;hould put on the kinde&s;t looks, you &s;hould u&s;e the mo&s;t endearing and conde&s;cending lan|guage;

<P>Bad company is undoubtedly one of the mo&s;t formidable and pernicious entangle|ments. By forming friend&s;hips with per|&s;ons of a vicious character, many a hopeful youth has learnt their ways, and found a

<P>All bad company is, in this re&s;pect, for|midable; but that is mo&s;t evidently &s;o, which is to be found at home. Great care ought therefore to be taken, that you ad|mit none into your families, who may de|bauch the tender minds of your children, by pernicious opinions, or by vicious prac|tices. This is a caution which &s;hould be particularly remembered, in the ca&s;e of &s;ervants. Take heed you do not bring in|to your families &s;uch as may diffu&s;e infec|tion through the &s;ouls of your dear off|&s;pring.

It is in the general true, that there is a &s;ilent, but powerful oratory in example, beyond the force of the mo&s;t elegant and expre&s;&s;ive words; and the ex|ample of parents has often a particular weight with their children; which &s;eems to be alluded to in that exhortation of St. Paul, <HI>Be ye followers</HI> (or imitators) <HI>of God, as dear children.</HI> So that on the whole, as a very celebrated writer well expre&s;&s;es it, "To give children good in&s;truction, and a bad example, is but beckoning to them with the hand to &s;hew them the way to heaven, while we take them by the hand
<PB N="88" REF="025410_0087_0FCD26F0D1BDDEC0">
and lead them in the way to hell." We &s;hould therefore mo&s;t heartily concur in David's re&s;olution, as ever we hope our families &s;hould be religious and happy: <HI>I will behave my&s;elf wi&s;ely in a perfect way; I will walk within my hou&s;e with a perfect heart.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Cheerfully accept of all proper a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances in the education of your children, if you de&s;ire it may &s;ucceed well.</P>
<P>It will be your wi&s;dom to accept of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which may be offered, either from books or friends. Books may in this re&s;pect be very u&s;eful to you; the book of GOD above all; both to furni&s;h you with materials for this great work, and to in|&s;truct you in the manner of performing it. Other writings may be &s;ub&s;ervient to this purpo&s;e. Wi&s;e and pious treati&s;es on the &s;ubject of education may be read with great plea&s;ure and advantage; and you may re|ceive &s;ingular a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e cate|chi&s;ms, and prayers, and &s;ongs for chil|dren, with which mo&s;t of your families are now furni&s;hed, through the conde&s;cen&s;ion of one valuable friend in writing them, and the genero&s;ity of another in be&s;towing them upon us. I hope you will expre&s;s your thankfulne&s;s to both, by a diligent care to
<PB N="89" REF="025410_0088_0FCD26F24927C7D0">
u&s;e them; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that you and yours may abundantly find your ac|count in them; for while the language is &s;o plain and ea&s;y, that even an infant may under&s;tand it, you will often find not only a propriety, but a &s;trength and &s;ublimity in the &s;entiments, which may be improving to per&s;ons of advanced capacities. There is much of that milk, by which &s;trong men may be entertained and nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>I add, that in this important work, you &s;hould gladly embrace the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pious and prudent friends. I can by no means approve that Lacedemonian law, which gave every citizen a power of cor|recting his neighbour's children, and made it infamous for the parent to complain of it: Yet we mu&s;t all allow, that con&s;idering the great importance of education, a con|cern for the happine&s;s of families and the public, will require a mutual watchfulne&s;s over each other in this re&s;pect: Nor is there any imaginable rea&s;on to exclude this from the number of tho&s;e heads on which we are to admoni&s;h one another, and to con&s;ider each other to provoke unto good works.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;eems more evident than this; and one would &s;uppo&s;e, that per&s;ons, who are acquainted with human nature, &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, that &s;elf-love might work under

this form, and that they might be a little blinded by a partial affection to their off|&s;pring. Such a reflection might engage them at lea&s;t patiently, or rather thankful|ly, to hear the &s;entiments, and receive the admonitions of their friends on this head. But in&s;tead of this, there is in many people a kind of parental pride, (if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion) which &s;eldom fails to exert it&s;elf on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. They are &s;o confident in their own way, and do &s;o maje&s;terially de&s;pi&s;e the opinion of others, that one would almo&s;t imagine, they took it for granted, that with every child nature had given to the parent a certain &s;tock of infallible wi&s;dom for the management of it; or that, if they thought otherwi&s;e, they ra|ther cho&s;e their children &s;hould be ruined by their own conduct, than &s;aved by any foreign advice. If this arrogance only ren|dered the parents ridiculous, one &s;hould not need to be greatly concerned about it; e&s;pecially as their high complacency in them&s;elves would make them ea&s;y, what|ever others might think or &s;ay of them: But when we con&s;ider the unhappy con&s;e|quences it may produce, with regard to the temper and conduct of the ri&s;ing genera|tion, it will appear a very &s;erious evil, well worthy a particular mention, and a particular care to guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="025410_0090_0FCD26F6CDDC08E0">As for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mini&s;ters in this work of education, I per&s;uade my&s;elf you will be &s;o wi&s;e as thankfully to embrace it, both in public and private; and let me urge you to improve it to the utmo&s;t. Accu&s;tom your children to an early con|&s;tancy and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in attending divine ordinances, and be often your&s;elves in|quiring, and give us leave &s;ometimes to inquire how they advance in acquaintance with religion, and in love to it.

In con|&s;equence of all, we may hope, that, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ome good impre&s;&s;ions may be made on the minds of children. And when they find a mini&s;ter willing to take pains to in&s;truct them; when they hear him &s;eriou&s;ly and tenderly pleading with them, and pleading with GOD for them, it may much engage their affections to him, and &s;o promote his u&s;efulne&s;s among them, in other ordinances, and in future years. And give me leave to &s;ay upon this head, that as no wi&s;e and good mini&s;ter will think it beneath him, to de&s;ire the affection of the children of his congregation; &s;o it is the duty of parents to cheri&s;h in their offspring, &s;entiments of re&s;pect and love to all the faithful mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and e&s;pecially towards tho&s;e who &s;tatedly labour among them. Whatever mi&s;takes you may di&s;|cover in our conduct, or whatever defi|ciencies in our public mini&s;trations, you &s;hould &s;tudy to conceal them from the no|tice of your children; le&s;t they &s;hould grow up in contempt of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ervices

<P N="6">6. La&s;tly, Be earne&s;t in prayer to GOD for his ble&s;&s;ing on your attempts in the education of your children, if you de&s;ire to &s;ee them &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This I would leave with you as my la&s;t advice? and though I have had frequent occa&s;ion to hint at it before, I would now more particularly urge it on your attentive regard. GOD is the author of every good and every perfect gift; it is He who has formed the mind and the tongue, and who teaches man knowledge and addre&s;s. On him therefore mu&s;t you fix your depend|ance, to teach you &s;o to conceive of divine things, and &s;o to expre&s;s your conceptions of them, as may be mo&s;t &s;uited to the capa|cities, the di&s;po&s;itions, and the circum|&s;tances of your children; and to him you mu&s;t look to teach them to profit by all, by his almighty grace to open their ear unto di&s;cipline, and to bow their heart unto un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A heathen poet could teach the Romans, in a form of public and &s;olemn devotion, to look up to heaven for influences from thence, to form their youth to the love and practice of virtue. Surely you, my friends,
<PB N="94" REF="025410_0093_0FCD26FB46E0D958">
are under much greater obligations to do it, and that in a chri&s;tian manner; earne&s;t|ly entreating the GOD of grace, to &s;end down on your ri&s;ing offspring the effu&s;ions of that ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, which was purcha&s;ed by the blood of CHRIST, and is depo&s;ited in his compa&s;&s;ionate hand. If you have ta&s;ted that the LORD is gracious, you are daily living on tho&s;e &s;upplies; let it be your con&s;tant errand at the throne of grace, to plead for your children there. Wre&s;tle with GOD in &s;ecret, for the life of their &s;ouls, and for tho&s;e regenerating influences on which it depends; and in tho&s;e family devotions, which I hope you dare not ne|glect, let the little ones, from their earlie&s;t infancy, have a &s;hare in your remembrance. You may humbly hope, that He, by who&s;e encouragement and command you pray, will not &s;uffer the&s;e &s;upplications to be like water &s;pilt upon the ground: and, in the nature of things, it may tend to make &s;e|rious impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of your children, to hear their own ca&s;e mentioned in prayer, and may di&s;po&s;e them with greater regard, to attend on what you &s;ay to them, when they find you &s;o frequently, &s;o &s;olemnly, and &s;o tenderly pleading with GOD for them.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV. ON THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROV. xxii. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Train up a Child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN treating on this &s;ubject of education, I have all along endeavoured, according to my u&s;ual manner, to make my di&s;cour&s;es as practical as I could. While I was de|&s;cribing and recommending the way, and offering my advices, with regard to the manner of conducting children into it, mo&s;t of what I &s;aid under tho&s;e generals was an application to you. I have therefore left my&s;elf the le&s;s to do here; yet I was not willing to conclude my di&s;cour&s;es on a &s;ub|ject, which it is probable I &s;hall never &s;o largely re&s;ume, without</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="025410_0096_0FCD270223418B10">Fourthly, a particular addre&s;s to my hearers, according to your different rela|tions, and characters in life.</P>
<P>This I promi&s;ed as my fourth and la&s;t general, and I enter on it without farther preface; humbly begging, that GOD, who has &s;o intimate an acce&s;s to all our hearts, would enable me to &s;peak in the mo&s;t awak|ening and edifying manner; and that he would by his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, apply it to your con&s;ciences, that it may be as a nail fa&s;ten|ed in a &s;ure place; that hearing and know|ing the&s;e things for your&s;elves, you may hear and know them for your good.</P>
<P>I would here particularly addre&s;s my&s;elf &mdash;fir&s;t to parents, then to children&mdash;and in the la&s;t place, to tho&s;e young per&s;ons who are grown up to years of maturity, but not yet fixed in families of their own.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let me addre&s;s my di&s;cour&s;e to tho&s;e of you who are parents; whether you have been negligent of the duties I have now been urging, or through grace have been careful in the di&s;charge of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. To tho&s;e who have been gro&s;sly ne|gligent in this important care.</P>
<P>I have here one advantage not common to every &s;ubject; I mean, that the guilty
<PB N="98" REF="025410_0097_0FCD270387D48FF8">
will immediately know them&s;elves. When we apply our&s;elves in general to uncon|verted &s;inners, ignorance of the nature of true religion, a neglect of conver&s;ing with your own &s;ouls, or the in&s;inuating preju|dices of &s;elf-love, may di&s;gui&s;e the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and teach people to &s;peak peace to them&s;elves, under the mo&s;t awful denunciations of wrath and vengeance. But here, one would imagine, that the re|collection of a few moments might be &s;uf|ficient to determine the ca&s;e; becau&s;e the que&s;tion relates to pa&s;t fact, and that not merely to one particular action, but to a long train and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of labours and at|tempts.</P>
<P>Now let your con&s;ciences witne&s;s, whe|ther I am guilty of a breach of charity, when I take it for granted, that there are &s;ome among you who have been, and are, very negligent of the duty I have now been enforcing? You have probably contented your&s;elves with teaching your children to read, and &s;etting them to learn, like par|rots, a prayer, and, perhaps too, a cate|chi&s;m and a creed. But I appeal to your con&s;ciences. Have you from the very day of their birth to this time, ever &s;pent one hour in &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;tructing them in the knowledge of GOD, and endeavouring to form them to his fear and &s;ervice; in &s;et|ting
<PB N="99" REF="025410_0098_0FCD27053A6E1588">
before them the mi&s;ery of their natur|al condition, and urging them to apply to CHRIST for life and &s;alvation; in repre|&s;enting the &s;olemnities of death, and judg|ment, and the eternal world, and urging an immediate and diligent preparation for them? Where is the time, where the place, that can witne&s;s, that you have been pour|ing out your &s;ouls before GOD on their ac|count, and wre&s;tling with him for their lives, as knowing they mu&s;t peri&s;h for ever, without the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his SON, and the grace of his SPIRIT? Where, or when, have you thus prayed with them, or for them? What &s;ermon have you heard, what &s;cripture have you read, with this thought, "This will I carry to my chil|dren, and communicate to them as the food of their &s;ouls?" I fear there are &s;e|veral of you who have been &s;o far from do|ing it, that you have hardly ever &s;eriou&s;ly thought of it as a thing to be done.</P>
<P>And I would a&s;k, Why have you not thought of it, and why have you not done it? Are the&s;e creatures that you have pro|duced like the other animals of your hou&s;es or your field, mere animated &s;y&s;tems of fle&s;h and blood, made to take a turn in life for a few days and months, and then to &s;ink into everla&s;ting forgetfulne&s;s? Or are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y rational and immortal creatures, that
<PB N="100" REF="025410_0099_0FCD271A6EF6B098">
mu&s;t exi&s;t for ever in heaven, or in hell? This is not a matter of doubt with you; and yet you behave, as if the very contrary to what you believe were evident, certain truth. In &s;hort, it is the mo&s;t barbarous part you act, and more like that of an ene|my than a parent.</P>
<P>It is not that you are in&s;en&s;ible of the workings of parental tenderne&s;s. No, far from that: it may perhaps &s;ometimes ri&s;e to a weak and criminal dotage: yet I re|peat it again, you are acting an ho&s;tile and barbarous part. You are greatly &s;olicitous for their temporal happine&s;s. For this you labour and watch; for this you deny your|&s;elves many an enjoyment, and &s;ubject your&s;elves to many an unea&s;y circum&s;tance: But, alas! Sirs, where is the real friend&s;hip of all this, while the precious &s;oul is ne|glected? Your children are born with a corrupted nature, perverted by &s;inful ex|amples, ignorant of GOD, in a &s;tate of growing enmity to him, and, in con&s;e|quence of all, expo&s;ed to his wrath and cur&s;e, and in the way to everla&s;ting ruin. In the mean time it is your great care, that they may pa&s;s through this precarious, mo|mentary life, in ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, perhaps in abundance and grandeur; that is, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as will probably lull them into a forgetfulne&s;s of their danger,
<PB N="101" REF="025410_0100_0FCCE2FBC41BB648">
until there be no more hope. How cru|el a kindne&s;s!</P>
<P>It brings to my mind the account which an ancient writer gives of the old Cartha|genians, which I can never recollect with|out great emotion. He is &s;peaking of that diabolical cu&s;tom which &s;o long prevailed among them, of offering their children to a dete&s;table idol, which was formed in &s;uch a manner that an infant put into his hands, which were &s;tretched out to receive it, would immediately fall into a gulf of fire. He adds a circum&s;tance, which one cannot mention without horror; that the mothers, who with their own hands pre&s;ented the little innocents, thought it an unfortunate omen that the victim &s;hould be offered weeping; and therefore u&s;ed a great many fond artifices to divert it, that &s;oothed by the ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es of a parent, it might &s;mile in the dreadful moment in which it was to be given up to the idol. Pardon me, my friends; &s;uch is your parental care and love; &s;uch your concern for the pre&s;ent ea&s;e and pro&s;perity of your chil|dren, while their &s;ouls are neglected: A fond &s;olicitude, that they may pa&s;s &s;miling into the hands of the de&s;troyer!</P>
<P>You know, with what ju&s;t &s;everity GOD reckoned with the I&s;raelites for their abom|inable wickedne&s;s, in taking his &s;ons and
<PB N="102" REF="025410_0101_0FCCE3009E6BAC88">
his daughters (for &s;o he calls the children of his profe&s;&s;ing people) and &s;acrificing them to be devoured: And can you &s;uppo&s;e, he will take no notice of the unnatural neglect of your's? Not to endeavour to &s;ave, is to de&s;troy; and is it a little guilt, when an immortal &s;oul is in que&s;tion? You probab|ly remember tho&s;e terrible words in Ezeki|el; (may they be deeply in&s;cribed on the hearts of all whom they concern!) <HI>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, therefore hear thou the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me? and if thou &s;peake&s;t not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to &s;ave his life, the &s;ame wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</HI> If ever you read this pa&s;&s;age with attention, you must own it is exceedingly awful, and mu&s;t be ready to &s;ay, "The LORD be mer|ciful to mini&s;ters! they have a &s;olemn ac|count to give." Indeed they have; and we thank you, if you ever be&s;tow a com|pa&s;&s;ionate thought and prayer upon us. But permit me to remind you, and though it be our ca&s;e, it is not our's alone; you have likewi&s;e your &s;hare in it. Your chil|dren are much more immediately commit|ted to your care, than you and they are committed to our's; and, by a parity of rea&s;on, if they peri&s;h in their iniquities,
<PB N="103" REF="025410_0102_0FCD27068C293C48">
while you neglect to give them warning, their blood will be required at your hand.</P>
<P>And when GOD comes to make inqui&s;i|tion for that blood, how will you be able to endure it? That awful day will open up|on on you, and the tribunal of GOD, in all its terrors, will &s;tand unveiled before you. Give me leave to direct your eyes to it in this di&s;tant pro&s;pect, while there is yet room to mitigate tho&s;e terrors. If you go on in this cruel negligence of the &s;ouls of your children, how will you dare to meet them at that judgment-&s;eat? How will you be able to an&s;wer the great FATHER of &s;pi|rits, when expo&s;tulating with you on ac|count of his offspring, as well as your's, who have been betrayed and ruined by your neglect? "Inhumane creatures," (may HE ju&s;tly &s;ay) "to whom &s;hould I have committed the care of them, rather than to you? Did they not, by my ap|pointment, derive their being from you? Did I not implant in your hearts the natur|al affections of parents towards them? And to increa&s;e the obligation, did they not pa&s;s through the tender &s;cenes of infancy and childhood in your arms, and under your eye? If you had no compa&s;&s;ion for their peri&s;hing &s;ouls, if you would exert no efforts for their deliverance and &s;alvation. from whom could tho&s;e compa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="025410_0103_0FCD270965FE3240">
efforts have been expected? But wherein did they appear? Behold the book of my remembrance, the records of thy life, thrown open before thee: Where is the memorial of one hour &s;pent in holy in|&s;truction, or in fervent prayer with them, or for them? Can I approve, can I acquit you on &s;uch a review? Or &s;hall I not ra|ther vi&s;it for the&s;e things, and &s;hall not my &s;oul be avenged for &s;uch a conduct as this?"</P>
<P>And your children&mdash;will they be &s;ilent on the occa&s;ion? Did Adam, in the di&s;tre&s;s and amazement of his &s;oul, when in the pre&s;ence of his Judge, accu&s;e Eve his wife, &s;o lately taken from his &s;ide, and commit|ted to his protection, and &s;till, no doubt, appearing lovely in the mid&s;t of &s;orrow? and will your children in that terrible day &s;pare you? You may rather expect, they will labour to the utmo&s;t to aggravate a crime which co&s;ts them &s;o dear, that &s;o they may, if po&s;&s;ible, alleviate their own guilt, or if not, indulge their revenge. "O GOD," (may they perhaps then cry out in the mo&s;t piercing accents of indignation and de&s;pair) "thou art righteous in the &s;entence thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t upon us, and we ju&s;t|ly die for our own iniquity. We have de&s;troyed our&s;elves. But wilt thou not re|member, that our ruin is in part chargea|ble
<PB N="105" REF="025410_0104_0FCD270C5E3D3218">
here? Had the&s;e our parents been faithful to thee, and to us, it had perhaps been prevented. Had our infancy been formed by religious in&s;truction, we might not have grown up to wickedne&s;s; we might not, in the advance of life, have de|&s;pi&s;ed thy word, and trampled on thy &s;on; but might this day have been owned by thee as thy children, and have ri&s;en to that in|heritance of light and glory, which we now behold at this unapproachable di&s;tance. Oh! cur&s;ed be the father who begat us; cur&s;ed the wombs that bare us; cur&s;ed the paps that gave us &s;uck! Remember us, O LORD, whil&s;t thou art judging them; and let us have this one wretched comfort, in the mid&s;t of all our agonies, that it is not with impunity that they have betrayed our &s;ouls!"</P>

<P>I will make no apology for the plainne&s;s, and earne&s;tne&s;s, which I have u&s;ed. Eter|nal intere&s;ts are at &s;take, and the whole te|nor of &s;cripture &s;upports me in what I &s;ay.

<P>You &s;ee, it is your parents' duty to bring you up for GOD. The great GOD of hea|ven and earth has been plea&s;ed to give his expre&s;s command, that you &s;hould be train|ed up in the way in which you &s;hould go, even in the nurture and admonition of the LORD.

you may under&s;tand and remember each of the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be willing to learn the things of GOD.</P>
<P>The things of GOD are very delightful, and they are very u&s;eful: and, whatever you may think of it, your life depends on your acquaintance with them, So CHRIST, him&s;elf &s;ays, this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent (John xvii. 3.) Therefore, you children, &s;hould not think much of the labour of learning the&s;e things. Oh! far from that, you &s;hould be every day upon your knees, beg|ging GOD that you may be taught to know him, and to know CHRIST. GOD has done a great deal more for you, than he has for many others. You might have been born in a place, where you never would have &s;een a Bible in all your lives; where you would never have heard the name of CHRIST, where you might never have been in&s;tructed in the nature of duty and &s;in, nor have been told of the world beyond the grave; and &s;o would probably have fallen into Hell, before you had known there was &s;uch a place. And the great GOD has ordered matters &s;o, that you are born under the light of the go&s;pel, and
<PB N="114" REF="025410_0113_0FCD271B98C33008">
have &s;uch plain and &s;uch excellent in&s;truc|tions, that you may know more of divine things in your infancy, than the wi&s;e men among the heathen did, when they were old and grey-headed, and had &s;pent all their lives in &s;tudy. And will you be &s;o ungrateful, as not to be willing to learn, when &s;uch provi&s;ion is made for your in|&s;truction? GOD forbid! Shall GOD give you his word, and your parents, and mi|ni&s;ters employ their time, and their pains, to teach you the meaning of it, and will you refu&s;e to attend to it? That were fool|i&s;h, and wicked indeed. I hope much bet|ter things of you. That is my fir&s;t advice: Be willing to learn. I add,</P>
<P N="2">2. Pray for tho&s;e who are to teach you.</P>
<P>I would hope, you little creatures, dare not live without prayer.

Now let me intreat you, that at &s;uch times you would pray for tho&s;e who in&s;truct you in divine things; pray that GOD would ble&s;s them for it, and pray that he would help them in it. In praying thus for us, you do indeed pray for your&s;elves. There is a gracious promi&s;e to the people of

<P>Pray for your parents: That GOD would help them to in&s;truct you in &s;uch a manner as they have now been directed: That they may do it plainly, &s;o that you may be able to under&s;tand what they &s;ay; and &s;eriou&s;|ly, that you may be brought to an holy awe of GOD; and tenderly, that you may be engaged to love GOD and his word, and CHRIST and his ways; and pray, that your parents may be &s;tirred up to do it fre|quently, to give you <HI>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</HI> that you may be put in mind of what you are &s;o ready to forget.</P>
<P>And let me de&s;ire you, my dear charge, when you pray for your parents, to pray for your mini&s;ters too. I declare it again in the mo&s;t public manner, it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire that children would pray for me. And I verily believe, every faithful mini&s;|ter of CHRIST would join with me in &s;uch a reque&s;t. We do not, we dare not, de|&s;pi&s;e the prayer of one of the&s;e little ones.

<P N="3">3. Take heed that you do not learn in vain.</P>
<P>The great truths which you are taught from the word of GOD, are not intended merely to fill your heads with notions, but to make your hearts and lives more holy. You know the way to your father's hou&s;e every &s;tep of it, but that would never carry you home, if you would not go in it. No more will it &s;ignify to know the way to heaven, unle&s;s we walk in it. <HI>If you know the&s;e things,</HI> &s;ays the Lord JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, <HI>happy are ye if ye do them.</HI> And I may add, that if ye do them not, it had been happier for you, if you had never known them. Dear children, con&s;ider it; it is but a little while, and you mu&s;t die: And when tho&s;e active bodies of yours are become cold, mouldering clay, the great GOD of heaven and earth will call your &s;ouls to his judgment-&s;eat.

And if it be found, that you have lived without thought, and without prayer, without any regard to the eye of GOD always upon you, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e word of GOD always before you, it will be a mo&s;t lamentable ca&s;e. You will have rea|&s;on to wi&s;h, you had never heard of the&s;e things at all; for he has &s;aid, <HI>The &s;ervant that knew his</HI> LORD'S <HI>will, and did it not, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes.</HI> Even while I am &s;peaking to you, death is com|ing on; perhaps his &s;cythe may cut you down, while you are but coming up as flowers. I &s;peak to you thus plainly and earne&s;tly, becau&s;e I do not know but you may be in eternity before another LORD'S day. Oh! pray earne&s;tly, that GOD would give you his grace to fit you for glo|ry; and that all of you may be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, that you may be made wi&s;e to &s;alvation by it.

One way or an|other you have perhaps &s;ilenced them. But is it a &s;mall thing to you, that you have thus wearied men, and will you attempt to weary your GOD al&s;o? Can you dare to hope, that

<P>Alas! Sinners, the way of all tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors is hard; but your's is peculiarly &s;o. You, to whom I am now addre&s;&s;ing, are in the morning of your days, and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the impre&s;&s;ions of a good education are yet entirely effaced.

And if you go on thus, how will you &s;tand in that judgment? What will you plead? On what will you repo&s;e the confidence of your &s;ouls, that will not prove a broken reed, which will go up into your hand, and pierce you deep, in pro|portion to the &s;tre&s;s you lay upon it? While you behave like a generation of vi|pers, think not to &s;ay within your&s;elves, <HI>We have Abraham for our father.</HI> Think not to plead a relation to the religious par|ents, who&s;e GOD and who&s;e ways you have for&s;aken.

Your parents were often pre&s;enting their &s;upplications and in|terce&s;&s;ions for you before the throne of grace, but there will be no room to pre&s;ent them before the throne of ju&s;tice: Nor will they have any inclination to do it. All the &s;prings of natural fondne&s;s will be dried up; they will no longer regard you as their children, when they &s;ee you in the accur&s;ed number of the enemies of their GOD.</P>
<P>And when you are thus di&s;owned by your parents, and di&s;owned by GOD, whi|ther will you cau&s;e your &s;hame and your terror to go? You, who have had &s;o many privileges, and &s;o many opportunities, perhaps I may add, &s;o many fond pre|&s;umptuous hopes too, how will you bear to &s;ee multitudes coming from carnal and pro|fane families, to &s;hare with your parents in the inheritance of glory, from which you are excluded? You, who were the children of the kingdom; who&s;e remor&s;e therefore mu&s;t be the more cutting: who&s;e condem|nation therefore mu&s;t be the more weighty! Ob&s;erve in how &s;trong and lively a view, our LORD has repre&s;ented this awful thought, in words, which, though imme|diately addre&s;&s;ed to the unbelieving Jews, are remarkably applicable to you: <HI>There &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth, when
<PB N="124" REF="025410_0123_0FCD272E49CE6810">
ye &s;hall &s;ee Abraham, and I&s;aac, and Jacob</HI> (your pious ance&s;tors) <HI>in the kingdom of GOD, and you your&s;elves thru&s;t out: And many &s;hall come from the North, and the South, and the Ea&s;t, and the We&s;t, and &s;hall &s;it down with them in the kingdom of GOD; but the children of the kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t out into utter darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But through the divine forbearance you are not yet &s;hut out. There is &s;till hope even for you, if you will now return to the GOD of your fathers, from whom, by the&s;e aggravated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, you have &s;o deeply revolted. Let me once more then tenderly intreat you, and &s;olemnly charge you, by the con&s;olation of the living, and by the memory of the pious dead, by your pre&s;ent comforts, by your future hopes, by the nearly approaching &s;olemnities of death and judgment, by the mercies of GOD, and by the blood of a Redeemer, that you con|&s;ider and &s;hew your&s;elves men; that you &s;et your&s;elves, as it were, attentively to read over the characters in&s;cribed on your memories and under&s;tandings in the cour&s;e of a religious education; that you hearken to the voice of con&s;cience repeating tho&s;e admonitions, and to the voice of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, as &s;peaking in his word to confirm them; and finally, that you apply to him in a mo&s;t importunate manner, for tho&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="025410_0124_0FCD272FC8F4C538">
victorious influences of his &s;pirit, which are able to mollify and to transform the&s;e hearts of &s;tone, and to rai&s;e even you from &s;o low a depth of degeneracy and danger, to the character and happine&s;s of the ge|nuine children of Abraham. GOD forbid, that I &s;hould &s;in again&s;t your &s;ouls, and my own, in cea&s;ing to pray that it may be &s;o! And now,</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall conclude all with an addre&s;s to tho&s;e young per&s;ons who have been, through grace, engaged to a becoming im|provement of the religious education they have enjoyed.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure of being well a&s;&s;ured, that there are many &s;uch among you: Many who are now the joy of mini&s;ters and parents, and the hope of the church for &s;ucceeding years. Let me intreat you, my dear brethren and friends, that you daily acknowledge the divine goodne&s;s, in fav|ouring you with &s;uch advantages; and, what is &s;till more valuable, in giving you a heart to prize and improve them.</P>
<P>Think how different your circum&s;tances might have been. Providence might have ca&s;t your lot in &s;ome di&s;tant age or coun|try, where the true GOD had been un|known, where your early &s;teps had been
<PB N="126" REF="025410_0125_0FCD2732DB9CD518">
guided to the groves and temples of dete&s;ta|ble idols, and you might po&s;&s;ibly have been taught to con&s;ecrate lu&s;t or murder by the name of devotion. Or you might have been educated in popi&s;h darkne&s;s, where the &s;cripture would have been to you as a &s;ealed book, and you would have &s;een chri&s;tianity polluted with idolatrous rites, on &s;ome accounts more inexcu&s;able than tho&s;e of the heathen, and adulterated with the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and pernicious errors. There the mi&s;taken piety of your parents might have proved a dangerous &s;nare, whil&s;t it had infu&s;ed a blind, and perhaps a cruel zeal, and a proud, furious oppo&s;ition to all the methods of better information.</P>
<P>Nay, even here, in a prote&s;tant coun|try, is it not too evident, there are many families in which, had you been born and educated, you had &s;ate as in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death, though in the land of light and the valley of vi&s;ion? Your infant-tongue had been formed to the language of hell, and exerci&s;ed in cur&s;es and oaths, ra|ther than in prayer. You had early been taught to deride every appearance of &s;eri|ous godline&s;s; and all the irregular propen|&s;ities of nature had been &s;trengthened by examples of wickedne&s;s, which might have been &s;ufficient to corrupt innocence it&s;elf. When you con&s;ider the wide difference be|tween
<PB REF="025410_0126_0FCD273447109800">
the&s;e circum&s;tances and your own, &s;urely whatever your portion of worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions may be, you have rea&s;on to lift up your heads to heaven with wonder and gratitude, and to &s;ay, <HI>The lines are fallen to us in plea&s;ant places, yea, we have a goodly heritage.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all: There are many around you, who have &s;hared in &s;uch advantages as the&s;e, and have &s;infully abu&s;ed them, to the di&s;honour of GOD, to the grief of their parents, and to their own danger, and per|haps their ruin. And why are not you in that wretched number, or who maketh thee to differ from them? Why are not your hearts barred again&s;t the entrance of a Redeemer, but becau&s;e the LORD has op|ened them? Why were not all the good in&s;tructions which have been given to you, like &s;eed &s;own upon a rock: but becau&s;e GOD gave the increa&s;e. Adore the riches of this di&s;tingui&s;hing grace.</P>
<P>And let me earne&s;tly exhort you, that you be careful &s;till farther to improve it. Give me leave to &s;ay, that the&s;e fair open|ings of early &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, do naturally rai&s;e a very high expectation of eminent ad|vances in religion. Let it be your humble and diligent care, that the&s;e expectations be an&s;wered: That your goodne&s;s may not be like the morning cloud, or the early dew,
<PB N="128" REF="025410_0127_0FCD2735C7E16908">
which &s;oon goeth away; but rather like the dawning light, which &s;hines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Providence continues the&s;e holy parents, to whom you have been &s;o highly indebted, let it be your con&s;tant care, by all the mo&s;t cheerful returns of duty and gratitude, to expre&s;s your regard to them&punc; and your &s;en&s;e of &s;o great an obligation. And I will add, let it be your care, to hand down to future ages tho&s;e important advantages you have received from them.</P>
<P>One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and an|other generation cometh. It is highly pro|bable, that in a few years, numbers of you will be conducted into new relations; and we plea&s;e our&s;elves with the hope, that you will carry religion and happine&s;s into ri&s;ing families. Let not tho&s;e hopes be di&s;ap|pointed. When GOD fixes you in hou&s;es of your own, let it be your fir&s;t concern to erect there &s;uch dome&s;tic altars, as tho&s;e at which you have wor&s;hipped with &s;uch holy plea&s;ure, and &s;en&s;ible tokens of divine ac|ceptance. Let the &s;acred trea&s;ure of divine knowledge which has been depo&s;ited with you, be faithfully delivered down to your de&s;cendants; that they, in their turn, may ari&s;e with the &s;ame pious zeal, to tran&s;mit it to another generation, that &s;hall be born of them.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="025410_0128_0FCD2738E573A580">And may divine grace, that inexhau&s;ti|ble &s;pring of the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ings, &s;weetly flow on to add efficacy to all, that real vital religion may be the glory and joy of every &s;ucceeding age; until this earth (which is but a place of education for the children of GOD, during their minority) &s;hall pa&s;s away to make room for a far nob|ler &s;cene and &s;tate of exi&s;tence; where pious parents and their religious offspring &s;hall for ever enjoy the mo&s;t delightful &s;oci|ety, inhabiting the palace of our heavenly Father, and &s;urrounding the throne of our glorified Redeemer!

<P>"IN this country where opinions are every where freely circulated upon all &s;ubjects, and where there is a great diver&s;ity of &s;enti|ments re&s;pecting religion; it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the cau&s;e of truth, to promote a ta&s;te for reading the works of judicious and practical writers upon the important doctrines of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>"Many books, remarkable for their evange|lical principles, and experimental method of treating religious &s;ubjects, have been publi&s;hed by the learned and pious reformers of their church, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the mini&s;try, which, although &s;ome of them are ob&s;olete in the language, and not very fa&s;hionable in the arrangement of the &s;everal parts, contain tho&s;e peculiar doctrines of grace, tho&s;e &s;criptural truths, which have been frequently ble&s;&s;ed with a divine influence.</P>
<P>"We are happy to find, that the demand for the&s;e &s;eems to increa&s;e of late, in various and di&s;tant parts of this country; and that, by the laudable exertions of &s;ome of the printers in America, who have publi&s;hed a great variety of practical works, and &s;everal editions of the Bi|ble, this demand is likely to be &s;upplied with convenience to the people, and on as rea&s;onable terms as they can be imported from Europe. We, therefore, take the liberty to recommend the following books, publi&s;hed in this country, to the e&s;teem and peru&s;al of our countrymen, both on patriotic and religious principles; and hope they will prove of eminent u&s;efulne&s;s to
