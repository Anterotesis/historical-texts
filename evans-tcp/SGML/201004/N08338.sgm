<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>BY way of preface I would offer a word or two to my rea|ders in general; but e&s;pecially to &s;uch as were the hearers of the following di&s;cour&s;e. I would inform you, that you mu&s;t not expect that it will appear word for word as it was when preached; it being then neither committed to writing or memory; yet the general lead, &s;cope and &s;ub&s;tance of it is the &s;ame.&mdash;As it is not my method to read my &s;ermons, as many do, &s;o neither do I commit to memory what I deliver, when I come to preach, as I under&s;tand that &s;ome do; for I think there is a medium between the&s;e two extremes, to be preferred before either of them; and that is for a preacher not to depend upon his notes, nor his memory neither, for what he is to deliver in public; and yet be as &s;afe, and much more in the way of a ble&s;&s;ing, than &s;uch preachers are, who confine them&s;elves to ei|ther of the for ementioned methods. Let a preacher that GOD has prepared for that work, have but the general plan, idea, or platform of his &s;ermon in his mind, when he is going to preach, with a heart that feels the weight of his &s;ubject, and the worth of &s;ouls, and he will not at all be likely to be blun|dered in his performances, altho' he has not his &s;ermon in his notes nor in his memory. However &s;tudious and faithful the godly preacher is in private, in order to furni&s;h him&s;elf with a pro|per me&s;&s;age to deliver to the people in public: yet this is certain, that he has not got all the materials in private that contribute much toward the rendering his compo&s;itions complete and entire. For the godly preacher finds by experience that he has great help
<PB N="iii" REF="010648_0002_0F81BD600ECE7B48" MS="y">in preaching by &s;ome pre&s;ent concurring circum&s;tances, while in the pulpit. The &s;ight of his audience, and their different apparent a&s;pect at pre&s;ent, whether &s;tupid or affected, with that degree of divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance that he has a right to expect from the LORD, to carry him through pre&s;ent duty, while the holy fervors of his own &s;oul are en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">amed and excited by the means of his addre&s;s to the &s;ouls of others. The&s;e things. I &s;ay, cannot fail of &s;ugge&s;ting ma|ny new ideas to the preacher, as he goes along in his work, and of furni&s;hing of him with abundance of proper matter to &s;peak that he had not tho't of before. So he ought to allow him&s;elf the liberty to improve the &s;ame as he pa&s;&s;es along in his work, which he cannot do, if he confines him&s;elf to written notes in his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">livery, or to what he has committed to his memory.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, that this method might do pro|vided the preacher was &s;ure always of having &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance in preaching, but &s;eeing he is liable to be left to &s;traitne&s;s of &s;pirit, it is but a point of prudence for him to preach by notes, to prevent boggles and blunders.</P>
<P>An&s;. I think that the remedy is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e: for, on &s;uppo&s;ition that the preacher &s;hould be &s;ometimes left to &s;uch &s;trait|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s of &s;pirit that he could not proceed with that freedom as would always be de&s;irable in the preacher; yet the effect hereof might do him much good; teach humility, and his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ndance on GOD; and learn him the nece&s;&s;ity of living in the power of reli|gion always, which he finds he needs when he comes to preach. But the bad effect of the remedy plead for is that it is like to keep the preache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;traitned in &s;pirit always: For if he can, by the help of his notes, get along one time without &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance in preaching, &s;o he can another, and another, and &s;o always; which I would repre&s;ent by a &s;imilitude, thus: Suppo&s;e a man was about to tra|vel a journey, but was &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful of providence, in pre&s;erving his legs through it, that he dur&s;t not &s;et out upon them in his jour|ney as other folks do, but think it a point of prudence to get him a pair of wooden legs, for fear his own would fail; but when he has got them, he travels &s;o much upon them, and neglects his own, that, in fine, it proves the very means which cau&s;es his own legs finally to peri&s;h, &s;o that ever afterwards, the man is obliged to u&s;e his wooden legs, or not go a &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p further. And it &s;eems to me, that this is much the ca&s;e with &s;ome preachers, who, by the gifts of nature and grace, have been con&s;iderably prepared to be real preachers, had they ventured out upon GOD, in the improvement of their preaching talents; but through timerou&s;ne&s;s, and di&s;tru&s;t of GOD, or in compliance with the cu&s;tom of reading notes, have
<PB N="iv" REF="010648_0003_0F81BD61816BA9A8">habituated them&s;elves &s;o to that practice, that their preaching gifts have dried up and peri&s;hed; or, as in the words of the &s;imilitude, they u&s;ed wooden legs &s;o much when they have better, that final|ly they had nothing better than wooden legs to u&s;e. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;ometimes, when an unexpected providence gives a fair opportunity for a &s;ermon, it mu&s;t be omitted, to the grief of hundreds, for no other rea&s;on but this, viz. that the preacher did not happen to have his notes with him.</P>
<P>But to return: From the hint above given of my method of preaching, the reader may under&s;tand, that I have took the &s;ame in writing the following di&s;cour&s;e, viz. that having the general plan and lead of it in my mind, fill'd it up, as I went along, with what did naturally occur. The occa&s;ion was &s;olemn; the &s;ubject is &s;olemn; and may GOD make the reader &s;olemn, think of death, and prepare for it; and then the end of the&s;e poor labours will be an&s;wered.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are the clo&s;e of the melancholly tidings, which Job's me&s;&s;engers brought him of his heavy lo&s;&s;es. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Job had a deep cup of affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction given him to drink, and by every me&s;&s;enger was made to drink deeper and deeper therein; this la&s;t me&s;&s;enger b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings him, as it were the very dregs of the cup. The former me&s;&s;engers told him of the lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his cattle, and outward &s;ub&s;tance; this la&s;t informs him of the lo&s;s of his children. Altho' in &s;ome circum&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es the lo&s;s of worldly &s;ub&s;tance may &s;eem heavy, yet in compari&s;on with the lo&s;s of children, it is nothing; e&s;pecially with the lo&s;s of children in a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, awful and unu&s;ual manner, as was the ca&s;e here with J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b; yet the good man takes it well, he takes it patiently. J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b looks beyond the the in&s;truments of his af|fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions, and eyes the hand of God, the fir&s;t cau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and ri&s;es up and reverences the hand that &s;mites him, and falls down in humility in the du&s;t before a &s;overeign God, and adores him. See v. 20, 21, 22, <HI>Then</HI> Job <HI>aro&s;e, and rent his mantle, and &s;haved his head, and fell down upon the ground and wor&s;hipped, and &s;aid, naked came I out of my mother's womb, &amp; naked &s;hall I return thi|ther: the Lord</HI> gave, <HI>&amp; the Lord hath taken</HI> away; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord. In all this Job &s;inned not, nor charged God</HI> fooli&s;hly.</P>
<P>Here, my afflicted friends and neighbours, here is a pattern &amp; an example worthy your imitation. Has the Lord given you Job's cup to drink? &s;ee then, that with Job's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion you receive it. Has the Lord &s;ent his lightning down from heaven? has it fallen on the young men? and are they dead? O, now ari&s;e! ari&s;e! and reverence the Maje&s;ty, the &s;overeign Maje&s;ty of heaven that has done it. Bow! bow, in humility, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &amp; re&s;ignation to the holy will of God, that is guided by uner|ring wi&s;dom, &amp; &s;ee that by no means you charge God fooli&s;hly.</P>
<P>Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trou|ble; and to the &s;aints e&s;pecially, this world is a vale of tears. And what wonder is it that a world &s;o full of &s;in and rebellion as this world is, &s;hould be &s;o full of affliction and &s;orrow as we &s;ee it is? yet we have no right to conclude that tho&s;e who are under the greate&s;t afflictions, are certainly the greate&s;t &s;inners:
<PB N="6" REF="010648_0004_0F81BD618B1D0820">the contrary is evident many times: and the rea&s;on is obvious, viz. this, that this world is not to be the place of rewards and puni&s;hments, but a &s;tate of tryal; and therefore God's di&s;|pen&s;ations are calculated according thereunto: that is, they are trying, and &s;ometimes exceedingly &s;o. And although God may &s;end tryals and afflictions, either in judgment or mercy, upon the wicked, as in his holy &s;overeignty he &s;ees fit; yet to his own children, he has bound him&s;elf by his gracious pro|mi&s;e, that he will correct in mea&s;ure and in mercy, if need be, and for their profit. But yet we find, by the &s;criptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e account, that God &s;ometimes has a two-fold aim in correcting, afflict|ing and trying his own children; as &s;ometimes for correction, and &s;ometimes more e&s;pecially for tryal. For correction, when they fall into any particular ways of rebellion; according to P&s;alm 89.30, 31, 32. "If his children for&s;ake my law, and walk not in my judgments, if they break my &s;tatutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with a rod, and their iniquities with &s;tripes." But &s;ometimes the Lord brings his children under afflictions, more e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or their tryal, when it is not to correct any &s;pecial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e with Abraham, when God called him to go and offer up his &s;on I&s;aac; it was a heavy affliction, and it was &s;ent for his tryal; to try his faith and obedience. Hence, &s;ays God to him, in the clo&s;e of that tryal, "Now I know thou feare&s;t God &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not withh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me." Gen. 22.12. God knew that Abra|ham truly feared him before, but here was now an eminent proof and demon&s;tration of it. And God loves to put the gra|ces of his children to the tryal; and here Abraham's &s;aith was &s;o tried and proved, that he is canonized in &s;cripture for the eminency of his faith, Heb. 11.19. "Accounting that God was able to rai&s;e him up even from the dead." And this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e with Job; he was afflicted grievou&s;ly, but not &s;o much for correction (he being con&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entiou&s;ly upright) as for his tryal. As, &s;ays James, <HI>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have &s;een the end of the Lord,</HI> Jam. v. 11. The end of the Lord, in afflicting Job, we &s;ee was to prove the eminency of his patience, baffle and confound the devil in his own &s;chemes and propo&s;als, and in the end to honor and exalt Job (or rather the &s;trength of his own grace in Job) as one of the mo&s;t eminent &s;aints left upon divine record. Hence he is ranked among the worthies, as we read of Noah, Daniel and Job, as &s;ome of the fir&s;t men to &s;tand in the gap to keep off God's judgments. And God intending thus to exalt him, &s;aw meet fir&s;t to prove him. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Job's afflictions was not &s;ent &s;o much to correct him
<PB N="7" REF="010648_0004_0F81BD618B1D0820">as to prove him, is plain from God's own words to &s;atan, af|ter that Job had rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ived the fir&s;t &s;hock of his trials with &s;uch compo&s;ure and patience, that in all of it he &s;inned not, nor charged God fooli&s;hly; &s;o that God &s;eems to boa&s;t of his e|minency to &s;atan, chap. 2, v. 3. "And the Lord &s;aid unto &s;a|tan, ha&s;t thou con&s;idered my &s;ervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and e&s;cheweth evil? and &s;till he holdeth fa&s;t his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egrity, altho' thou moved&s;t me again&s;t him to de&s;troy him without cau&s;e." And we all &s;hould, my friends, if po&s;&s;ible, learn the meaning and de&s;ign of God, when he &s;endeth afflic|tions, whether he &s;ends them for correction or for trial, that we may be in a better circum&s;tance to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of pro|vidence. If our afflictions are &s;ent for correction, then we ought to repent, reform, and do no more &s;o wickedly; but if for tryal, then we &s;hould &s;ee to it that tho&s;e graces hold out in their exerci&s;e, to the glory of God, as faith, love, patience, re&s;ignation, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. that we may, with Job, come forth, as gold brightened by the fire of <HI>affliction.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the words I fir&s;t read: <HI>And it fell upon the</HI> young men, <HI>and</HI> they <HI>are dead.</HI> In the&s;e words we may note &s;everal things; as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. And event is held forth, viz. death: 'tis &s;aid, they are dead.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Who they were, that are &s;aid to be dead; which we find they were not aged people, or men of grey hairs; but the young, the young men are dead, viz. Job's children.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. We have here the means of their death held forth, viz&punc; the fall of the hou&s;e. The wind came from the wilderne&s;s, and &s;mote the four corners of the hou&s;e, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. We may note the employment that death found them in, viz. fea&s;ting. They were eating bread and drinking wine in their elde&s;t brother's hou&s;e, and perhaps not the lea&s;t appre|hen&s;ive of death till it come. O! what dying mortals are we! how liable to the &s;troke of death at any time, at any place, and in any employment! O! what need is there of be|ing always ready! for we never know when we are &s;afe from the &s;troke of death; but &s;ometimes, when mo&s;t cautious, mo&s;t expo&s;ed;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Man's caution often into danger turns,</L>
<L>And his guard falling, cru&s;hies him to death.</L> <BIBL><HI>Night Thoughts.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> and that which we mean to be our protection, may prove the means of our de&s;truction, as was the ca&s;e here with Job's children: their hou&s;e they made for their protection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut it was made the means of their de&s;truction. Solomon &s;ays <HI>There are</HI> many <HI>devices in the heart of man; but the coun&s;el of
<PB N="8" REF="010648_0005_0F81BD624B0A81F0">the Lord, that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> We may devi&s;e means and mea&s;ures in which we may think we are &s;afe; but in God's coun&s;el, tho&s;e very means and mea&s;ures are &s;ometimes to prove our death. And was not this the ca&s;e with two of the young men now dead? who had been at work in a neighbouring field, and &s;eeing the &s;torm ari&s;ing, aim'd to come here to this hou&s;e for &s;helter; but no &s;ooner were they &s;eated in their chairs but death chain'd them down to rife no more.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And, by the way, what think you, my hearers, concerning death? tho&s;e of you, in particular, who &s;aw the young men (as many of you did) before they were removed from their &s;eats, in which they &s;at, when the fatal fla&s;h burnt in two the tow thread of life. I &s;ay, what do you think of death? Did not you then &s;ee death in a more &s;triking light, and piercing view than perhaps ever before? death &s;itting upright in chairs, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nly looking all &s;pectators in the &s;ace, as they came into the room! And can you any more forget that you are mortal? can you any more forget death until your own dying day? can you, when, for ought you know, it may come as &s;oon as the morning light of the next day; yea, &s;ooner too, for we &s;ee that we know not what a day may bring forth.</P>
<P>But what I aim to &s;peak further upon this &s;ubject, and to improve the pre&s;ent opportunity (God willing) to the be&s;t ad|vantage I can, is, not to give the character of the dead; but to improve the gloomy, melancholly theme, <HI>DEATH!</HI> which my text leads us to, and the late awful providence fixes our eyes upon, to the benefit of the living; and this is all the advan|tage we may hope for, from the &s;olemn &s;cene now before us. The living cannot benefit the dead, but the dead may benefit the living: For that God who can bring light out of dark|ne&s;s, and meet out of the eater, can al&s;o bring life out of death: And that this may be the event, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;aints of God, let you cries a&s;cend to heaven.&mdash;I don't feel over critical about a curious method, at pre&s;ent; yet &s;eeing that &s;ome one mu&s;t be attempted, let it be the following, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Let us meditate upon death a little, &s;ince we have &s;o much occa&s;ion therefor, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider &s;ome of the important con&s;equences of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Con&s;ider, that even young men, in the bloom of youth, are liable to the &s;troke of death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That young men are not only liable to the &s;troke of death, but to a &s;udden &s;troke, without a minute's warning, as to the time when. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Some brief improvement.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="9" REF="010648_0005_0F81BD624B0A81F0">
I &s;hall not at this time, con&s;ider death all the ways I find the word u&s;ed and applied in &s;cripture; but only in this three|fold manner. Briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The lo&s;s of God's moral image in which man was at fir&s;t made; or that &s;tate of alienation from God into which mankind are &s;unk, by the original apo&s;tacy, and all unregene|rate men are yet in, is called death, and men are naturally in a death-&s;tate, and <HI>dead while they live,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith the &s;cripture, 1 Tim. v. 6. that is &s;piritually dead, while naturally alive; <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins,</HI> Eph. 2.1.</P>
<P>The true life and happine&s;s of the rational &s;oul does not con&s;i&s;t merely in being endowed with &s;uch powers and facul|ties as the great Author of human nature has given thereunto, as the <HI>under&s;tanding, will</HI> and <HI>affections,</HI> which are e&s;&s;ential to the very being and exi&s;tance of a rea&s;onable creature; not yet in the &s;oul's union to the body. But the true life and happi|ne&s;s of the rational &s;oul con&s;i&s;ts in a&s;piritual union to God; or a corre&s;ponding frame of mind and temper of heart to the vari|ous repre&s;entations of the perfections and attributes of God. As a filial fear and reverence of the greatne&s;s, maje&s;ty and power of God; a firm belief and tru&s;t in the faithfulne&s;s and promi&s;es of God; an humble dependance on the all-&s;ufficient fullne&s;s of God; a cheerful and hearty compliance with the will of God, and an holy delight in the purity and moral beauty of the divine nature, &amp;c. In the&s;e things con&s;i&s;ts the true life of the &s;oul; and as it was &s;aid of Adam in his fir&s;t creation, he become a living &s;oul, it was true in this &s;en&s;e, his &s;oul was alive, &s;piritually, having the&s;e corre&s;ponding di&s;po&s;itions of &s;oul towards God, co-natural with his exi&s;t|ance. But alas! by the fall, how is the gold become dim! yea, become bra&s;s; for the mo&s;t fine gold is changed; the image and life of God removed, and the image of &s;atan and death introduced. For who don't &s;ee, that &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any thing &s;piritually, that there are none of the&s;e right di&s;po&s;itions of mind toward God, naturally to be found in mankind? Since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fall, men are naturally &s;o far from the true reverential fear of God, in heart, that they are rather inclined to &s;ay in their hearts, that there is no God, P&s;al. 14.1. And in&s;tead of being inclined to tru&s;t in the faithfulne&s;s of God, mankind are more inclined to tru&s;t in lies and fal&s;hood, Jer. 13, 25. And in&s;tead of depending upon the all-&s;ufficient fullne&s;s of God, natural men had rather depend on ci&s;terns, yea, broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water. Jer. 2, 13. and in&s;tead of loving God for his purity and holine&s;s, that is, the very thing upon the ac|count of which they hate him &s;o mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly as they do, that their
<PB N="10" REF="010648_0006_0F81BD630E808A28">minds are very enmity in the ab&s;tract, Rom. 8.7. And in&s;tead of loving God's laws, and cheerfully complying with his will they &s;ay in plain terms, that they will not have this man to rule over them, Luke 19, 14. O! what a &s;ad and awful death-&s;tate are natural men in! this &s;piritual death is a thou&s;and fold greater calamity and heavier judgment than merely natu|ral death. And all of you, my heaters, that are yet in your natural &s;tate, are thus dead; and by rea&s;on of this &s;piritual death, you are more deformed, loath&s;ome and naucious in the eyes of the holy God, than the&s;e corp&s;e are in your eyes, by means of natural death. And &s;hall the &s;ight of three dead corp&s;es this day, fetch tears from many of your eyes, and &s;hall not the con&s;ideration of &s;o many dead &s;ouls as we have among&s;t us, fetch groans from none of your hearts? if not, it &s;eems it mu&s;t be becau&s;e the dead are burying the dead.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;tate and condition that the wicked &s;hall be placed and fixed in after this life, and e&s;pecially after the judgment day, is called death. And death, in this &s;en&s;e con&s;idered is of a very comprehen&s;ive &s;ignification, including all evil in it, even compleat de&s;truction. Hence it is called the &s;econd death, yea, eternal death.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;&s;olving the union between &s;oul and body, is call|ed death; and here the word is to be under&s;tood in its mo&s;t natural and obvious meaning, that every one knows what is meant by death, in this &s;en&s;e of the word, tho' few con&s;ider, as they ought, the con&s;equences of it. And death, in this latter &s;en&s;e of it, with &s;ome of its important con&s;equences, is what now lies before us, which my text, and the pre&s;ent pro|vidence calls unto the con&s;ideration of. When the me&s;&s;engers bro't us the late awful news, that the young men were dead, that three were killed with one clap of thunder, or awful fla&s;h of lightning, the melancholly ideas were &s;oon catched by e|very on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; none a&s;k for information what is meant by death, for all expect, all know, that death turns the &s;prightly, active youth into a ga&s;tly, breathle&s;s corp&s;e, which evidently &s;hews that the heavy, leaden hand of death has clo&s;ed the eyes for time, and chain'd in &s;ilence the nimble tongue as long, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d has &s;o marr'd the beauty of the whole &s;tructure, that the mo&s;t tender relative can't endure the awful &s;pectacle, but is ready to cry with Abraham, concerning his once beautiful Sarah, Let me bury my dead out of my &s;ight, Gen. 23, 4. A few of the im|portant con&s;equences of death, I would here mention. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Immediately upon the di&s;&s;olving of the union between &s;oul and body, there is an everla&s;ting parting with a worldly enjoyments. It is a &s;ad effect of the apo&s;tacy that mankind
<PB N="11" REF="010648_0006_0F81BD630E808A28">pur&s;ue the world &s;o greedily, and &s;eize upon its enjoyments &s;o eagerly, as if true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted herein, or as if they would la&s;t forever, and were durable and permanent good. Certain|ly worldly enjoyments are &s;leeting in the nature and de&s;ign of them, yea, they are always on the wing, ready for their flight; but if they halt a few moments by the command of heaven, bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd mortals think that they will always &s;tay, and look for no higher nor better good; yea, neglect the higher, better, and only good, for the fake of the&s;e things. And the worldly heart of fallen man will be contriving how to make bed of re&s;t among the &s;miling charmes of creature delights; but, alas! to his &s;urprize, before he has got compo&s;ed upon his a bed of ea&s;e, he is all on a &s;udden &s;ummon'd immediately to appear in the eternal world! But this will not &s;ufficiently in|&s;truct the re&s;t of the worldly tribe to &s;eek a better good, but cheated with &s;ome delu&s;ion, worldly hearts will pre&s;ume upon la&s;ting happine&s;s from worldly things; even again&s;t ten thou|&s;and informations &amp; warnings to the contrary. But I &s;ay, death will put an end to all the&s;e enjoyments. O! how &s;hort liv'd are they! O! how &s;oon is the bubble broke! what a panick might this &s;trike thro' the heart of all worldlings, who have their portion in this life, <HI>Thou fool, this night &s;hall thy &s;oul be required of thee, then who&s;e &s;hall all the&s;e things be?</HI> Luke 12, 20. At death there will not only be a parting, but an everla&s;ting parting with worldly enjoyments; for the &s;aints in heaven will have a better, a full, and an eternal &s;upply, without the&s;e things; and altho' the damn'd in hell will be in eternal want, yet worldly enjoyments would not releive them, &s;uppo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey might have them; but have they mu&s;t not, &s;hall not, no, not &s;o much as a drop of water to cool their tormented tongues. It &s;eems that this con&s;ideration &s;hould moderate our pur&s;uit of this world's goods, and excite us to &s;ecure a more la&s;ting happine&s;s. O, labour not &s;o much for the meat which per|i&s;heth, but more for that which endureth to everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another important con&s;equence of death is, a final end to all means of grace: an end to all means, helps, and op|portunities of preparing for our future and eternal &s;tate, God has wonderfully di&s;tingui&s;hed the fallen race of man, from the &s;inning angels; them he re&s;erved in chains, under darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day. But the &s;overeign mercy and grace of God hath interpo&s;ed in the behalf of poor fallen man,</P>
<P N="1">1. By providing a Mediator. For, without this, there would have been no more hope for fallen man, than for devils,</P>
<P N="2">2. In granting a repreive to mankind, longer or &s;horter, according to the &s;overeign plea&s;ure, and in this &s;pace of re|prieve,
<PB N="12" REF="010648_0007_0F81BD6491DFF168">to afford means of grace; as the written word, a preached go&s;pel, the Liberty of the throne of grace, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. And becau&s;e mankind are &s;o aver&s;e to the way of life and &s;o entirely under the power of &s;in, that meerly external means are in&s;ufficient to prevail upon any of the fallen race truly to return to God, in the ways of the go&s;pel; therefore, over and above the&s;e external means, God is &s;ending down the influences of his holy &s;pirit, to &s;trive with &s;inners, and accom|pany the outward means, and make them effectual to &s;ound conver&s;ion, and con&s;equently to eternal &s;alvation. And O! what wonders of mercy are here, which the fallen angels ne|ver had!</P>
<P>And thus mankind come into the world, under the guilt of their original apo&s;tacy, and the cur&s;e of the broken law; re|prieved by the mercy of God only for a few uncertain mo|ments, as &s;overeign wi&s;dom &s;ees fit, with the means of grace in their hands, which, if not rightly improved, and truly complied with, will a&s;&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dly aggravate their eternal mi&s;ery. And O! what an awful and critical &s;ituation are mankind then in! and how rea&s;onable is it to expect that rational crea|tures in our circum&s;tances, &s;hould be engaged to the utmo&s;t degree, in improving the day and means of grace! Methinks this &s;hould be the language of one and all, of one to another. "O! the infinite mercy of God, in providing a Mediator for us, and thro' him, has open'd a door of hope, and is now af|fording means of grace, and giving us an opportunity to make our peace with God! Come, come, O! come, let us enter while there is room, and before the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e ri&s;es up, and &s;huts too the door of mercy. Behold! now is the ac|cepted time, and day of &s;alvation, and let us improve it. Let us &s;eek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. Let us &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and mind the one thing needful; and agree with our Adver&s;ary quickly, while we are in the way with him, and have means, and an opportunity &s;o to do. O! let us cry mightily to the Lord, and who can tell but that he will turn away his wrath, that we peri&s;h not."&mdash;I &s;ay, one might rea&s;onably expect that &s;uch would be the language, and &s;uch the conduct of rational creatures, in our circum&s;tances: but, alas! how rever&s;e of all this do we find the practice of men! in&s;tead of a thankful en|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gedne&s;s in improving the day and means of grace, O! how dreadfully are they &s;lighted and abu&s;ed! how many prayerle&s;s per&s;ons! how many &s;abbath breakers! how many di&s;pi&s;e the word, and grieve the &s;pirit of God! and becau&s;e grace hath thus far abounded, O! how do men abound in &s;in! <HI>and be|cau&s;e

<P>But how much &s;oever the means of grace are &s;lighted, neg|lected or abu&s;ed, they won't la&s;t always; death will put an e|ternal end to them, and to all opportunities of improving them. The man that would not improve his time for God, his &s;oul, and eternity, &s;hall then have no more time to improve, if he would. The man that would not bow the knee in prayer a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the throne of grace, while God waited to be gracious, will then find that it is too late to pray; or if he &s;hould pray, plead, cry, and weep tears of blood, it would avail him nothing. And he that in the time of life, thought that &s;abbaths and &s;ermons came too thick and often, and were too long and tedious, and wore ready to complain, what a wearine&s;s are the&s;e things? when will the &s;abbaths and the new moons be gone? O then he would give worlds, had he them at command: Ah! for one of tho&s;e tedious &s;abbaths back again! O? for a little of that time, more precious now than gold! But all in vain; for it is too late, too late, eternally too late! O! immortal &s;ouls! bound for eternity, and will quickly be there! if you would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;e, improve time while you have it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>moment's &s;eize;</L>

<P N="3">3. Another important con&s;equence of death is, that it puts an end to all opportunity of performing, and di&s;charging re|lative duties. It is of great importance that relative duties are faithfully di&s;charged; &s;uch as parents owe to children, and children to parents, rulers to &s;ubjects, and &s;ubjects to ru|lers, mini&s;ters to their people, and people to their mini&s;ters, &amp;c. The honor of God, the intere&s;t of religion, and the good and welfare of the ri&s;ing generation depend much hereupon. But, O! what &s;ad neglects here! and why? Why time e|nough yet, all are too apt to plead. The parent don't intend to die &s;o, nor that his child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hall neither, in &s;uch awful neg|lects of religion, and &s;oul concern; and the mini&s;ter in ends by and by to be more thoro' with his people; and all hope to di&s;charge relative duties, in a future period, in a better manner than at pre&s;ent they do. But alas! &s;udden death comes and puts a &s;top to all&mdash;think of this, you that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ck in the di&s;charge of you relative duties, when death
<PB N="14" REF="010648_0008_0F81BD65470053F0">comes you can't then di&s;charge them better, you can't then di&s;charge them at all, if you would.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another important con&s;equence of death is, that it unal|terably fixes the &s;oul for eternity, either in weal or wo, hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery to change no more. 'Tis true there may and will be &s;ome circum&s;tantial alteration, that the &s;oul will meet with after death: as union to the body at the re&s;urrection, &amp; the &s;aints happine&s;s will be progre&s;&s;ive, and the mi&s;ery of the damned (perhaps) thro' eternity. But there will be no chang|ing from happine&s;s to mi&s;ery, or from mi&s;ery to happine&s;s, but in this re&s;pect, as the tree falls &s;o it lies, &amp; will eternally. But this world in which we now live is a changing world, and ble&s;&s;ed be God that it is (wo to all the wicked if it were not) for among other changes, a &s;aving change may po&s;&s;ibly be met with in this world, but not in the next; he that is there found filthy, mu&s;t remain &s;o &s;till, and &s;till, and &s;till eternally; and he that is holy &s;hall remain &s;o as long. O, Beloveds! look before you leap, for the leap is for eternity.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed to &s;peak a word briefly to the &s;econd gene|ral head propo&s;ed, viz. <HI>That even young men in the bloom of youth, are liable to be cut down by the &s;troke of death.</HI> This is confirmed abundantly if we con&s;ult either &s;cripture or com|mon ob&s;ervation, and is &s;o evident, that in words none will deny it, altho' in practice, it &s;eems as if there were but few that did really believe it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;criptures are full to this point; the text we are up|on tells us, the young men are dead; and Luke tells us of a certain young man that was carried out dead, the only &s;on of his mother, Luke 7. And &s;ays Job, one dieth in his full &s;trength, being wholly at ea&s;e and quiet, his brea&s;ts are full of milk, and his bones moi&s;tened with marrow, Job 21, 23, 24. But I &s;hall not &s;tand to multiply in&s;tances of this nature, given in &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is evident to, and by commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;ervation abundantly. How many youth have we known in our day, that have been cut down by the &s;troke of death? &s;ome at home, &s;ome abroad, &s;ome by &s;udden death, &s;ome by a lingering &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ome fall in battle, &s;ome are wa&s;ted by the wartery waves on a &s;udden to the &s;hore of eternity, and others, quick as the lightning's fla&s;h, fly from this world to the next, as on blazing wings of fire. Oh! there is but a &s;tep acro&s;s from the road where the young walk, in the days of youth, to their eternal home, in the other world; and how many are there in youth that take this &s;tep! how many youth are cut acro&s;s and &s;oon get home, and never travel round by the way of grey hairs, and old age
<PB N="15" REF="010648_0008_0F81BD65470053F0">for it? and it is too evident, that youth are liable to the &s;troke of death, to &s;tand longer upon this point. But this is not all. Therefore I proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">III. That youth are not only liable to be cut down by the &s;troke of death, <HI>but by a &s;udden &s;troke, without one minute's warning, as to the time when.</HI></P>
<P>What a &s;trange thing is here, and yet how common too! for all to have warnings, a thou&s;and warnings of death's ap|proach, and yet &s;o many die without the lea&s;t warning; death not mi&s;tru&s;ted to be near, until he's done his work, &s;truck the fatal blow and fled. The old world had an hundred and twenty years warning of the flood, and yet were &s;wept away &s;uddenly by it at la&s;t. For, &s;ays Matthew, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, Mat. 24.38, 39. And &s;o it was with Sodom, and &s;o it will be at the end of the world, and &s;o it is with re&s;pect to particular deaths; not|with&s;tanding all the warnings of its approach; how often do people cry peace and &s;afety, until &s;udden de&s;truction in this &s;en&s;e, comes upon them. But if you want a further proof of this awful point, viz. <HI>That youth are liable to be cut down by a &s;udden &s;troke of death, without one minutes warning, as to the time when,</HI> the late awful providence that has called us toge|ther at this time, is a full demon&s;tration. For if by the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word &s;hall be &s;tabli&s;hed, then we have a competent number of witne&s;&s;es this day to bear te&s;|timony to the pre&s;ent truth; and &s;uch they are too, who&s;e ve|racity in their te&s;timony, won't &s;o much as admit of di&s;pute; for altho' they are dead, yet they &s;peak, and &s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dly too, and more effectually to the pre&s;ent point than the living can. And what &s;ay you my hearers? if you won't believe the te&s;ti|mony of the living, which God &s;ends you, dare you reject the te&s;timony of the dead? Dives tho't in hell, if one might be &s;ent from the dead, his te&s;timony would be believed. But, dear youth, God is &s;ending you, not only a &s;inge, but a triple te&s;timony from the dead, that greatly concerns you all, and will you not believe it? don't their witne&s;&s;es all agree? don't they &s;peak the &s;ame thing? don't they &s;peak truth? don't they &s;peak important truth? don't they &s;peak loud, loud as the voice of thunder? did you ever hear the voice of thunder loud|er? And yet, if you are deaf, and cannot hear, this day, God bids you look and &s;ee; that if you won't believe your ears, believe your eyes, and know that you are mortal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>All men think all men mortal but them&s;elves.</P>

U&s;e fir&s;t of information. Hence learn, how ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary it is, even for young people to be truly religious. There is a prevalent di&s;po&s;ition naturally in young people, to put off religion for the pre&s;ent, thinking there is time enough yet, and that it is not a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uitable to their age. Young people think it be&s;t for old folks, who have as it were one foot in the grave, of very age, to be religious, think of death, and prepare for it; but are very apt, in their tho'ts to exempt them&s;elves from any pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting about the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of religion in good earne&s;t. But O youth! youth! learn here how pre&s;umptuous is your practice! true it is, that old people mu&s;t die; but then it is as true that young people may die, and often do, when the old are &s;pared: And a re|markable in&s;tance of this nature, has been &s;een now, in this late &s;urprizing providence. When death came among&s;t us &s;udden, and in this awful manner &s;lung his darts, cut down three, at one in&s;tantaneous &s;troke, was it becau&s;e there was no aged people in the town, that the young were taken? or was it becau&s;e there was no aged people in the neighbourhood? nay further, was it becau&s;e there was no elderly people in the hou&s;e then at the &s;ame time, when the young &s;ell victims to the rage of death? no, &s;urely; for altho' &s;everal elderly people then were pre&s;ent, yet they were pa&s;s'd by, yea, protected in the very jaws of death! one in &s;pecial, aged almo&s;t to an hundred years, &s;itting &s;ide by &s;ide as it were free among the dead, in about, the &s;pace of three &s;eet of the &s;lain, yet e&s;caped unhurt, untouch'd. So that here, dear youth, you may &s;ee your age is no defence again&s;t the &s;troke of death; nor have you any certainty that the aged mu&s;t die fir&s;t. O then, if you may die before the aged; if you may die in youth, and if you may die by a &s;udden &s;troke, without a minute's warning as to the time when; how nece&s;&s;ary it is for you always to be prepared? or, in other words, to be truly religious? and all of you, that are old enough to reflect upon the&s;e things, ought without farther delay, to lay the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to heart, free to Chri&s;t for refuge, and make your peace with God, get into, and live in, an actual readine&s;s for death; then let it come, it cannot hurt you; yea, let it come ever &s;o &s;uddenly, it can then do you no hurt, for to die will be gain.</P>

If the young may die, and die &s;uddenly, as we have heard; then we may hence learn what great obligations are aged laid under to God, for his pre&s;erving mercy to them &s;uch a length of time. O, my aged fathers and mothers! look into this gla&s;s, and here &s;ee your indebtedne&s;s to God. Why were you not &s;ent from the womb to the tomb? why were you not cut down in childhood or in youth, as thou&s;ands have been? why have not the arrows of death been permit|ted to &s;trike you, when they have been flying &s;o thick all a|round you, for &s;uch a number of years? when others have been con&s;tantly falling by your &s;ide; yea, on every &s;ide; and you &s;pared, &s;pared now yet once more, when the young have been taken, I &s;ay, whence comes this to pa&s;s? what can you attribute it to? is it not meer mercy, and &s;overeign goodne&s;s in God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">at has thus di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed you from &s;o many others of your fellow creatures?

Therefore, my aged friends &amp; neighbours, altho I would reverence your grey hairs, yet up|on this occa&s;ion I cannot but remind you of your great ob|ligations to God, who&s;e kind vi&s;itations have hitherto pre|&s;erved you in life; and al&s;o faithfully, and in a &s;olemn man|ner, I would warn you of the dreadful aggravations of that mi&s;ery, which a long life, &s;pent in &s;in, will inevitably pull down upon &s;uch guilty &s;ouls, who will venture to be &s;o dar|ingly pre&s;umptuous; for the &s;criture &s;aith, <HI>but the &s;inner being an hundred years old, &s;hall be accur&s;ed,</HI> I&s;a. 65, 20.

Therefore, think of this, you that have been long, and &s;till are, the &s;ubjects of the &s;par|ing mercy of God: le&s;t it all prove bitterne&s;s in the end, and one day you wi&s;h, in the angui&s;h of your &s;oul, that you had died, and never &s;een the &s;un.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="010648_0010_0F81BD6A087FE740">my hearers, if you venture but a little longer to tread their &s;teps. But that, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, I may excite you, one and all of you, immediately to &s;et about, in good earne&s;t, the bu&s;ine&s;s that relates to the everla&s;ting welfare of your &s;ouls, I would, for your con&s;ideration, lay a few things before you, by way of motive, to excite you hereunto.</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider that it is all owing to the meer mercy, free and &s;overeign grace of God, that you have any &s;pace, means and opportunity to make your peace with God, prepare for death, and the eternal world. Devils never had it, and were it not for &s;overeign mercy, man had never had it neither.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, that the &s;pace and opportunity that you have to prepare for death, at longe&s;t wont be long; and for aught you know, it may end with you before the &s;etting &s;un.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, if you &s;hould, any of you, neglect the only &s;ea&s;on which God will allow you to prepare for death in, as it is awfully to be feared you will, then, when it is too late, you'll cur&s;e your&s;elf, and your folly for't, eternally in hell. And the Devil, who tempts you now, all he can, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o delay your &s;oul concerns, flattering you that there is time enough yet, will then in&s;ult you for a fool, for hearkening to his lies.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider how dear it co&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to pur|cha&s;e that &s;alvation that is offered to you in the go&s;pel; yea, the day and means of grace he purcha&s;ed at a dear rate for &s;inners. Hence Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be the Saviour of all men; that is, &s;o far as they are &s;aved, he is their Saviour. If &s;in|ners have a temporary &s;alvation, a &s;hort &s;pace of reprieve from the execution of the threatened &s;entence again&s;t &s;in; and if they have life, and the comforts of life a while; all this is owing to Chri&s;t, and it is meer mercy, which the &s;in|ner don't de&s;erve: but e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider &s;inners as favoured with the means of grace, and offers of eternal life, it is owing to Chri&s;t, for he purcha&s;ed that life, and &s;alva|tion which is offered.</P>
<P>And can you, my hearers, take the common ble&s;&s;ings of life, purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate, and con&s;ume them upon your lu&s;ts? can you wa&s;te away the day of grace, in pur&s;uing this world, and the vain plea&s;ures of this life? And can you, dare you trample under foot the great &s;alvation offered to you in the go&s;pel? The&s;e favours were purcha&s;ed with a price infinitely more worth than the whole world; not with &s;uch corruptible things as &s;ilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God. If all the meer men on earth, and all the angels in heaven, had laid down their lives, to have purcha&s;ed the&s;e favours for &s;inners, the price had been too
<PB N="20" REF="010648_0011_0F81BD6B4AEC9D98">low, and rejected as in&s;ufficient, Therefore hearken, O &s;inner, and hear! I will &s;peak a dreadful word unto you, yet a truth, an awful truth, which you will find &s;o one day; that if you continue to live as you li&s;t, and con&s;ume tho&s;e dear|bought favours upon your lu&s;ts, and wa&s;te away the golden &s;ea&s;on of grace, and flight and reject the offers of Chri&s;t and &s;alvation: that you will have a mo&s;t dreadful, aggravated condemnation, in the end, when God &s;hall come to make in|qui&s;ition for blood, and no common and ordinary blood nei|ther; but this precious blood of Chri&s;t, the guilt of which will be found under your &s;kirts; for you will then be counted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the betrayers and murderers of Chri&s;t, who were not content with his once being crucified by the Jew? and Romans; but by your &s;ins you have been all your life long crucifying of him afre&s;h, and putting him to open &s;hame. And where will your doom or portion be in the coming world? among the <HI>Sodomites?</HI> no, verily, but leagues below them, in the regions of darkne&s;s and woe, if not below devils them&s;elves, for &s;urely they never were guilty of &s;uch crimes.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider further, O &s;inner! that once, when David's three worthies put their lives in their hands, and broke through the ho&s;ts of the Phili&s;tines, to fetch him &s;ome water he long|ed for; yet when they brought it, and David come to con&s;i|der how they expo&s;ed their lives to get it for him, it wrought &s;o upon his compa&s;&s;ions, he could not bear to drink it, but poured it out before the Lord. But the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t not only put his life in his hand, that is, expo&s;ed his life; but he actually laid down his life O &s;inner! to purcha&s;e all the&s;e favors you enjoy, and can you &s;eize upon them greedily, not regarding the price? can you be lavi&s;h of that which is the price of blood, and yet never think of him that bled? O! where is your ingenuity! O! vile ingratitude!</P>
<P>Think again, how contrary is your conduct in meer world|ly affairs, and how much more wi&s;e and prudent? how choice and &s;aving are you of that which is very dear and co&s;tly, of a worldly nature? if you have any thing that is uncommonly dear and co&s;tly, you are not wont to u&s;e and di&s;po&s;e of it as you be of cheap, common and ordinary things. And if you were as wi&s;e in &s;pirituals, O! how careful would you be to hu&s;band your time well, and make the be&s;t u&s;e of the means of grace po&s;&s;ible; and improve all earthly enjoyments with re&s;elence to death and the eternal world.</P>
<P>Once more, under this head, con&s;ider that you mu&s;t be ac|countable to God for all the&s;e dear articles, if you abu&s;e them, or don't improve them as God requires. God don't give the&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="010648_0011_0F81BD6B4AEC9D98">favours ab&s;olutely out and out, to &s;inners, and there's to be an end; no, no; but only conditionally. If a &s;inner does im|prove well the favours he enjoys in this world, and as God re|quires him to do, he is welcome to them all, and eternal life to boot; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut if he don't, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for them all. Re|bellious &s;inners mu&s;t give an account of their &s;teward&s;hip by and by; and, O! what a dreadful an account it will be that they will have to give, when it will be made to appear, that they have wa&s;ted their Lord's goods, dear and co&s;tly goods, the invoice, the book of God, tells us the price was infinite. And, O dreadful! what do you think &s;inner, of having ten thou&s;and talents, in fair articles bro't in again&s;t you at the rec|koning day, and at the &s;ame time you have nothing to pay? and for want thereof, the body mu&s;t be taken, and the &s;oul too, and ca&s;t into the pri&s;on of hell, untill you pay the debt; <HI>Verily thou &s;halt by no means come out thence, untill thou ha&s;t paid the ut|mo&s;t farthing,</HI> Mat. 5.26. Therefore, O &s;inner, as free and as lavi&s;h as you are, with the favours and bounties of heaven, as tho' they were cheap and common things: I tell you, that the time will come, that you will think their price is really dear, whate'er you think of it now. And as &s;oft and indul|gent as the&s;e mercies are at pre&s;ent, while their &s;ilent lan|guage is, enjoy and welcome, if you'll love and &s;erve the giver; yet if abu&s;ed, by and by they'll harden into &s;teel, and &s;harpen into &s;words, and vi&s;it you again in another form, and in a &s;tern, unrelenting manner, demand &s;atisfaction, for their abu&s;e, in all the &s;everity of &s;trict ju&s;tice. There is not a mercy come from heaven, to the &s;ons of men, but what will return thither again, with a true account, how they were re|ceived, how entertained, how improved, and by whom. Time, precious time will complain, Lord, I was abu&s;ed and murdered by &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, and improved wholly to wrong purpo&s;es: &s;abbaths complain, Lord, we were pro|faned by &s;uch and &s;uch who were weary of us, and longed to have us gone, we being tedious and but then&s;ome company to them: the bible will complain of being neglected; &s;ermons of being &s;lighted; invitations of being refu&s;ed; con&s;cience of being &s;tifled, and brow beat, and counteracted; the mo|tions of the &s;pirit rejected, and the holy Spirit often grieved, &amp;c. Now the&s;e will be bitter complaints alledged again&s;t go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ing, and Chri&s;t rejecting &s;inners; and they will awake the divine re&s;entment, to the highe&s;t pitch; and God will &s;ay, go vi&s;it them again with full commi&s;&s;ion to &s;eek &s;a|tisfaction and revenge for &s;uch gro&s;s abu&s;e, &amp; heaven daring ingratitude.

<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider how many and great are the helps and advan|tages that God is affording you now, in order that you might get prepared for death. And among the re&s;t of the many precious means and helps that you have, this awful provi|dence, God has now come forth to us in, might be a very great help to you in this weighty affair, would you improve it as you ought. For now you are &s;olemnized. Now the le|vity and vanity of your minds is check'd. 'Tis very evident by your countenances, that you have no di&s;po&s;ition for a pre|&s;ent frolick; and it may be &s;ome of you think you never &s;hall have again. But O, your deceitful hearts! if you don't get them truly changed by renewing grace, will turn to their old cour&s;e, and run as &s;wift in the channel of former vanity as e|ver. Therefore now it &s;eems, is your time, if you have any &s;piritual prudence at all, and intend ever to make your peace with God, now &s;et about the work in earne&s;t, while the im|pre&s;&s;ion of this providence is not worn off. It &s;eems that your hardne&s;s, blindne&s;s and &s;tupidity has been &s;o great, that you have obliged the Almighty, as I may &s;ay, to &s;peak in an unu&s;ual manner to you. Had you been all obedient to the gentle voice of mercy, in the loving invitations of the go&s;pel, and the &s;weet whi&s;pers of the Spirit; doubtle&s;s this awful voice of thunder might have been &s;pared. For will the lion roar in vain, and when there is no cau&s;e? And upon who&s;e account, my hearers, do you think it is, that God has come thus &s;ur|prizingly among&s;t us? deck'd him&s;elf with thunder, &amp; cloath|ed him&s;elf in flames, and as with a puff of his fiery breath, has on a &s;udden blew out the candle of life in three in&s;tances among us; while others &s;corch'd and &s;tun'd, did, as it were

No, no, my friends, for our &s;akes, for the &s;ake of the living, doubtle&s;s are the&s;e awful deaths &s;ent. And as we had a high hand in bringing down this di&s;pen&s;ation, God has an errand to us herein, we may conclude, without he&s;ita|tion. And what is it?

O may the good Lord forbid! yet I am afraid it will, with re&s;pect to many of you. I am afraid you won't improve this providence &s;o as to get any la&s;ting good by it. But if you would be wi&s;e for your&s;elves, wi&s;e for your &s;ouls, and wi&s;e for eternity: now is your time, dear youth, when God is calling you &s;o loudly. If you wont hear a loud call, this loud call, what will you hear? Common and ordinary calls, it &s;eems won't do the turn, won't prevail with you, ma|ny of you, to turn to God; and if this extraordinary and un|common call wont prevail upon you neither, what will? And this may not only be the loude&s;t, but it may al&s;o be the la&s;t call that ever God will give you. And it looks as proba|ble as not, that now is come the turning point for eternity with re&s;pect to &s;ome of you; and if you don't hear and turn now, it is to be feared that God will give you up, and &s;ay to you as of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.

<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider, that now many eyes will be upon you, to &s;ee how you behave, under this di&s;pen&s;ation of providence, and how you improve it. God's eye will be upon you, as it always has been, and he will, it the book of his remembrance, re|cord every circum&s;tance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l your conduct, in order to the day of account and reckoning. Man's eye will be upon you; the good in hopes to &s;ee &s;ome good effect; and the bad in or|der to imitate your had example, with a bolder face, while they &s;ee that others do the like; and the devil will now have his eyes upon you, to &s;ee whether he is like to lo&s;e his prey; he don't love to &s;ee you affected, &s;erious and prayerful; he hates you &s;hould be concern'd about your &s;ouls, and tho'tful of their eternal welfare; he had rather &s;ee you eagerly pur&s;u|ing earth, than to &s;ee you in earne&s;t for heaven; he had rather &s;ee you inclined to read romances and play books, than the bible; and had rather &s;ee you at a merry frolick, &s;iddling and dancing, drinking and carou&s;ing than to &s;ee you in your clo&s;et, upon your knees praying, or at a religious meeting, with the people of God, wor&s;hipping.

<P N="1">1. To this neighbourhood. This providence is a loud call to the whole town, yea, to neighbouring towns, but it is louder to this neighbourhood: and let others improve it as they will, do you, my friends, improve it aright: and don't let the voice of God, &s;o loudly and awfully uttered, in this neighbourhood, be utter'd in vain. And don't let it be bro't in as a charge again&s;t you at la&s;t, that when God came into the neighbourhood; in this awful manner, and &s;mote three of your friends and fellow creatures dead by your &s;ides, that the re&s;t repented not; for this will be a heavy charge, if true.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would &s;peak a word to the friends of the decea&s;ed. As God has come nearer to this neighbourhood, in this di&s;pen&s;a|tion, than to tho&s;e who live more remote; &s;o he has come nearer to you &s;till; and if you don't an&s;wer the call of God herein, you will be inexcu&s;eable with a witne&s;s! but if you improve this providence aright, you will find mercy in all this &s;everity, and in the clo&s;e, be able to &s;ay that it is good for you that you have been thus afflicted, and that in faithful|ne&s;s the Lord hath done it.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would &s;peak one word to &s;uch who&s;e lives were emi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ently expo&s;ed, and yet, through the mercy of God, you are &s;pared. If all others &s;oon forget this di&s;pen&s;ation, yet can it be po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould? can you, when you have not on|ly heard God's awful voice, but felt a touch of the hand of his dreadful power; and being &s;corch'd, and &s;ing'd by his light'ning's awful blaze, it &s;eems you can't but know, that <HI>our God is a con&s;uming fire.</HI> And yet &s;eeing your lives are &s;pared, O how great are your obligations to hear the voice of Chri&s;t, &s;peaking to you in this providence! the language of which &s;eems to be this, go for the pre&s;ent, and <HI>&s;in no more, le&s;t a wor&s;e thing befal you.</HI></P>
<P>And now, one word to you all, both old and young: If after all that has been &s;aid and done to prevail with you to turn to the Lord, by &s;ound repentance, and unfeigned faith,
<PB N="26" REF="010648_0014_0F81BD6E49675170">yet if any of you &s;hall venture to go on in &s;in &s;till, and let the impre&s;&s;ions of truth, and divine Providence wear off, without any good and la&s;ting effect upon you; I wou'd ju&s;t remind of another &s;torm that is a coming, in&s;initely more dreadful than this late awful &s;torm has been; the dimen|&s;ions of which will not be con&s;ined within the limits of a few miles in breadth, or hours in length, as was the ca&s;e with this late &s;torm; but it will over-&s;pread the while world of the wicked, and extend to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mo&s;t bounds of hell, as to the breadth of it; and as to the length of it will continue in its terror, without abatement, worlds without end. And the clouds of this &s;torm have already been long gathering, and &s;o far ri&s;en in the horizon of the written word, that is appears plain to faith's view now: and it will quickly over|&s;pread our horizorn with a mo&s;t melancholy gloom; for it will be a day of darkne&s;s, and gloomine&s;s, of clouds and thick darkne&s;s. And before the terrors of this day, which will be &s;o great, the &s;un and the moon will quit their &s;tation, flee, &amp; hide as in &s;ome dark abi&s;s, and will never venture to &s;hew their faces in the firmament any more. And the thunder and lightning of that day, will not be &s;uch as has now been; meerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o beat down tops of chimneys, tare thro' roofs of hou&s;es, and &s;trike a few individuals; but &s;o terrible and powerful will the thunder of that day be, that as with one clap, the earth will &s;plit to the very center, and the whole globe crumble as in a moment, to du&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and powder, and the lightnings awful blare will turn the very elements into a meer I quid flame. And millions and millions, even all the wicked &s;hall fall victims to the thunder of God's wrath in that day. As wicked men and devils were the Jonahs that cau&s;ed this tempe&s;t to ari&s;e, &s;o in that day when it comes none of them all will be able to &s;tand before it, or flee or make their e&s;cape from it, but naked and defencele&s;s they mu&s;t lie open to it, in all the terrors of it, while G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d's wrath will beat upon them as in one eternal &s;torm, without the lea&s;t mitigation.</P>
