<HEAD>SKETCHES OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH POLITICKS IN <HI>AMERICA,</HI> IN MAY, 1797.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the rulers of a free people pre&s;ume to overleap the bounds of law; when they im|po&s;e upon the credulity of hone&s;t men who have not, &s;ome, the capacity, others, the means, of information; when every &s;tratagem of knavery and cunning is &s;pread to en&s;nare the weal of &s;imple innocence; when the gorgeous fabrick of civil and religious liberty, which has been reared upon the bones, cemented with the blood of patriots, is tottering to its fall, his mu&s;t be &s;ure a cold or coward heart, which &s;wells not as with a&s;pick's tongues. Let rogues and &s;ycophants indulge them&s;elves in the unhallowed rites of ba&s;e idolatry, wor&s;hipping the mimic godhead greatne&s;s which they have fa&s;hioned; but let the hardy, true republican rai&s;e up a warning voice to the mi&s;guided multitude, that they defile them|&s;elves
<PB N="2" REF="031803_0003_0FEE73EF48D8D8C8">no more with vile pollutions. For me, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to develope principles however veiled beneath the ma&s;k of power: and for the unblu&s;hing tribe of up&s;tart courtiers, whether &s;wollen with the poi&s;on of ambition, or ba&s;ely ducking to the lordly brow, I hold their anger as my &s;port: I execrate the wretch who treads upon the helple&s;s neck of innocence, I &s;corn the worm that crawls beneath his feet: and, while they cower to the &s;courge of &s;atire, let them re|joce, &s;ince they commute for this the tree of infamy they have de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h faction in America having thrown the republic into a &s;tate of civil animo&s;ity and di&s;union at home, and peril from the ho&s;tility of long e&s;tabli&s;hed friend&s;hip abroad, and the treaty of amity and commerce with Great Britain be|ing the pe&s;tilent &s;ource of the&s;e di&s;orders, it is a natural &s;ugge&s;tion that we &s;hould attempt to rid our&s;elves of this dete&s;ted box of evils, returning it with loathing to the Pandora of this latter age.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming it as a datum that the treaty is a de|te&s;table in&s;trument, nor &s;hall I &s;trive to illumin|ate a &s;un-beam, let us proceed to the examination of &s;uch principles as may pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and which would authorize a republican congre&s;s to &s;purn this in&s;trument in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution, the congre&s;s is ve&s;ted with the power of regulating commerce: by this pow|er they have an opportunity of interrupting our intercour&s;e with Britain, and &s;pringing a mine under the very ba&s;is of the treaty; thereby ren|dering us re&s;pectable to the Briti&s;h monarchy,
<PB N="3" REF="031803_0004_0FEE73F48F409250">and once more dear to the French republick. That it is ju&s;t to contravene the treaty I &s;hall fir&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h; afterwards that it is expedient: and in &s;peaking of the expediency of the mea&s;ure, I &s;hall make &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary remarks upon the late mea&s;ures of the government of France.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of the ju&s;tice of the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure: and in the cour&s;e of this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion I &s;hall, as much as may be, adhere to the authority of a writer, to whom the mini&s;try have, in their rea&s;onings, con&s;tantly di&s;covered a decided preference.</P>
<P>But before we re&s;ort to any other authority, let us appeal to that of the con&s;titution it&s;elf, no militation with which, it is apprehended, will be adventured even by tho&s;e hardy champions who have &s;et at nought the proude&s;t bulwarks of truth, and have made incur&s;ions upon the con|fines of common &s;en&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e infractions of the con&s;titution, which were made by the adoption of the treaty, as the law of the land, without the con&s;ent of the hou&s;e or repre&s;entatives. Of this kind were, fir&s;t, the a&s;&s;umed powers of re|gulating commerce; &s;econd, of e&s;tabli&s;hing a rule of naturalization; third, of making all laws nece&s;&s;ary for carrying into execution any powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in the general govern|ment. Of this kind too is the a&s;&s;umed power of granting appropriations of money which more|over makes room for the power to e&s;tabli&s;h new federal courts to be paid by congre&s;s. All the&s;e points have been ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="031803_0005_0FEE73F6182ECBC0">
But even in the preamble it&s;elf to this illegal in&s;trument, it is a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;enate had ad|vi&s;ed and con&s;ented to the appointment of Mr. Jay to the negotiation of the &s;ame. This pre|vious mea&s;ure, which was never taken, was in|deed directed by the con&s;titution; an Mr. Jay's acting without it, was not only and infraction thereof, but &s;uch a one as Britain, had &s;he not &s;o much rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the treaty, would not have he&s;itated at plea&s;ure to have made her plea for a violation of the compact.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s have powers to define and puni&s;h pi|racies, but not by any other mean than what is pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution; namely, a trial by jury. But by the 21&s;t article of the treaty, the Briti&s;h are allowed to puni&s;h an American ci|tizen for piracy, in any mode they &s;hall think proper. Of the woful influence which this ar|ticle has had upon the politicks of the French we &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>Moreover congre&s;s are not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any powers not expre&s;sly granted by the con&s;titution; they had therefore no right to prohibit a citizen from expatriating him&s;elf at plea&s;ure; they might indeed refu&s;e to readmit him as a citizen when &s;o expatriated; but to detain him again&s;t his will, or puni&s;h him for the freedom of his actions abroad, was a &s;pecies of tyranny not ex|ceeded by the u&s;urped domination of an Ea&s;tern de&s;pot: It was nothing le&s;s than to cut him off from the la&s;t re&s;ort of an indignant hero, who &s;hould exclaim with Sidney,
<Q><L>Manus haec inimica tyrannis</L>
<L>En&s;e petit placidam &s;ublibertate quietem.</L></Q>
<PB N="5" REF="031803_0006_0FEE73F79F871B20">Be&s;ides it is expre&s;sly declared (in the 7th article of the amendment to the con&s;titution) that no per&s;on &s;hall beheld to an&s;wer for a capital or other|wi&s;e infamous crime, unle&s;s on a pre&s;entment or indictment by a grand jury, except in ca&s;es ari|&s;ing in the land or naval forces, or in the mili|tia, while in actual &s;ervice, in time of war or pub|lic danger; nor be deprived of <HI>life, liberty</HI> or <HI>property,</HI> without due cour&s;e of law. Now a man who has expatriated him&s;elf, and con&s;e|quently is no longer a citizen of the country he choo&s;es to abandon forever, is not only unju&s;tly deprived of his <HI>liberty</HI> in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, but of his <HI>life</HI> if he attempt to regain his liberty (that is to indulge his will by entering into a fo|reign &s;ervice) and all this too without the <HI>due cour&s;e of law.</HI></P>
<P>It has been denied (and I have not &s;een it pro|ved) that congre&s;s has a legal right to alienate its powers. Congre&s;s we know is ve&s;ted with the power of regulating trade, and may there|fore co-operate with the executive in the fabri|cation of a treaty. But becau&s;e this may be done in in&s;tances which particularly affect the intere&s;ts of the nation, and to the extent that the negotiation of treaties u&s;ually demands, does it follow, that it is con&s;i&s;tent with the con|&s;titution, in tho&s;e momentous in&s;tances which touch the very vitals of the government? Does it follow, that becau&s;e one congre&s;s, by virtue of its authority in regulating trade, has pa&s;&s;ed laws for the purpo&s;e of creating a treaty, ano|ther congre&s;s, under circum&s;tances of imperious
<PB N="6" REF="031803_0007_0FEE73F9264BFC50">nece&s;&s;ity too, &s;hall not, by virtue of the &s;ame authority to regulate trade, now devolved upon them, be at liberty to repeal the&s;e pernicious acts? A writer, above alluded to, cites &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions of Mr. Maddi&s;on (u&s;ed, I believe, in the convention of Virginia, for the purpo&s;e of re|conciling the audience to the treaty making pow|er). They are to this effect: That the treaty making power was never intended to warrant any part of the legi&s;lature in an act for di&s;mem|bering any part of the empire, or alienating any e&s;&s;ential right; and that the whole legi&s;lative au|thority po&s;&s;e&s;s not this power. <HI>The exerci&s;e of the power (&s;ays he) mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with the object of the delegation.</HI>&mdash;Now one object of the delegation of the treaty making power, was the improvement of commerce; but it certainly never was de&s;igned that commerce &s;hould be erected upon the ruins of legi&s;lation, much le&s;s that partial commercial advantages &s;hould be purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate.</P>
<P>Vattel &s;ays (and we &s;hould have known it had he not &s;aid it) that whenever a mini&s;ter ex|ceeds the in&s;tructions of his &s;overeign, a treaty is void. He &s;ays, moreover, if I mi&s;take not, that the violation of a &s;ingle important article of a treaty abrogates the whole.</P>
<P>Now the &s;overeign of a free government is the people; and the in&s;tructions of this &s;ove|reign are contained in the con&s;titution they have cau&s;ed to be compo&s;ed: but we have &s;een above, that the&s;e in&s;tructions have been exceeded in &s;everal important particulars; and had they
<PB N="7" REF="031803_0008_0FEE73FAAF1B72C0">been exceeded only in the &s;olitary in&s;tance, in which Mr. Jay has made a treaty without the previous advice of the &s;enate; it is evident, that this delu&s;ive preamble, it&s;elf, would have been &s;ufficient to annihilate every article of the treaty which accompanies it, although each had been modelled as correctly, and as &s;crupulou&s;ly, by the dictates of the con&s;titution, as they are in many in&s;tances mo&s;t impudently forged in evident defiance and contempt of its authority.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH rea&s;onings, as the foregoing, it is ap|prehended are &s;ufficient, and even &s;uper|fluous, to the purpo&s;e of convincing the ene|mies of the Briti&s;h treaty, that it is unwarrant|ed by the con&s;titution: and we have long &s;ince experienced, that the friends of Briti&s;h politicks are impracticable to all the arguments of a re|publican. To &s;uch men it would be vain to urge, that in the con&s;truction of an article of the con&s;titution, when an ambiguity occurs, that meaning &s;hould prevail, which is mo&s;t fa|vorable to the intere&s;ts of a republican govern|ment. But were we even to admit the con&s;ti|tutionality of the in&s;trument, principles could &s;till be found, which would militate as power|fully again&s;t its claim to our e&s;teem.</P>
<P>It is declared by the mi&s;chievous fabricators of the treaty, which we have entered into with our enemies, again&s;t the intere&s;ts of our aban|doned
<PB N="8" REF="031803_0009_0FEE7402743A7008">friends, that America had it not in her choice, at that time, by any other means, to ob|viate a war with Britain. This treaty then, with our brother and good ally, king George the IIId, who had already cut the throats of an hundred thou&s;and of our fathers and brothers, this treaty of true and &s;incere friend&s;hip was made, we &s;ee, under the muzzles of his guns, and at the points of his bayonets. Whether an in&s;trument &s;o executed, be binding or not upon the weaker party, is a que&s;tion by no means wor|thy a con&s;ideration to men who love a &s;ceptred ruffian; but it &s;urely will not fail to give &s;ome pau&s;e to tho&s;e, who love much more the freedom, the happine&s;s, and the innocence of their coun|try.</P>
<P>Vattel (p. 180, large octavo) expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf thus, "Though the &s;imple injury, or &s;ome di&s;advantage in a treaty, is not &s;ufficient to ren|der it invalid, the ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with tho&s;e inconveniences which lead to the ruin of a &s;tate. Since every treaty ought to be made with a &s;uf|ficient power, a treaty pernicious to the &s;tate is null, and not at all obligatory; no conductor of the nation having the power to enter into en|gagements to do &s;uch things as are capable of de|&s;troying the &s;tate, for the &s;afety of which the empire is entru&s;ted to him. The nation it&s;elf being nece&s;&s;arily obliged to perform every thing required for its pre&s;ervation and &s;afety, it can|not enter into engagements contrary to its in|di&s;pen&s;ible obligations. In the year 1506, the &s;tates general of the kingdom of France, a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="9" REF="031803_0010_0FEE7403FB6811A0">at Tours, engaged Lewis XI to break the treaty he had concluded with the emperor Max|imilian, and the archduke Philip, his &s;on; be|cau&s;e that treaty was pernicious to the kingdom. They al&s;o found, that neither the treaty, nor the oath that had accompanied it, could oblige the king to alienate the dominions of the crown."</P>
<P>Now if a treaty, which has for its object the impoveri&s;hment of a country, by the impo&s;ition of the harde&s;t conditions; if a treaty (entered into by a monarchy with a republick) which evidently tends by the unqualified, unalterable intercour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed thereby, to the utter ex|tirpation of republican principles, if a treaty of monopoly and foreign influence may be &s;aid to lead to the ruin of &s;uch a government, the prin|ciples laid down by Vattel give ample warrant to a rejection of the Briti&s;h treaty; nor will any zealous commonwealth's man, any man who&s;e blood has chilled with horror at the mar|tyrdom of Sydney, or boiled with indignation at the intemperate claims of a Stuart, or Brun&s;|wick, one moment he&s;itate to pronounce that deed a cur&s;ed compact for his country's down|fal. I will even venture to a&s;k any &s;en&s;ible and candid man, how great &s;oever his zeal in Briti&s;h politicks, whether he &s;eriou&s;ly believes the king and parliament of England would not tear into a thou&s;and pieces any in&s;trument, &s;igned under the pre&s;&s;ure of the occa&s;ion, if they &s;aw each article operating to their injury; and whether they would even give the que&s;tion but a &s;econd thought, when they had fore&s;een this in&s;trument <HI>would probably introduce into their dominions, the
<PB N="10" REF="031803_0011_0FEE74058594F480">principles of republican government.</HI> Let tho&s;e who know the object of the pre&s;ent bloody and expen&s;ive war with the French republick, deny this doctrine if they can.</P>
<P>How entirely different from the maxims of Briti&s;h policy, are the principles laid down by Vattel, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;tructing treaties. After &s;peaking of the propriety of pre&s;erving a reciprocity of advantage in &s;uch contracts, he adds, "I &s;ee tho&s;e pretended great politicians &s;mile, who place all their &s;ubtilty in circumven|ting tho&s;e with whom they treat; and regula|ting the conditions of the treaty in &s;uch a man|ner, that all the advantage &s;hall accrue to their ma&s;ters. Far from blu&s;hing at a conduct &s;o con|trary to equity, to rectitude, and natural honor, they make it their glory, and pretend to merit the name of great negociators. How do men in a public character glory in what would di&s;ho|nor an individual? The private man, if he is without con&s;cience, al&s;o laughs at the rules of morality and ju&s;tice; but he laughs in &s;ecret; it would be dangerous and prejudicial to him, publickly to make a mock of them. The pow|erful abandon more openly the hone&s;t for the u&s;eful. But it frequently happens, for the hap|pine&s;s of the human race, that this pretended utility becomes fatal to them, and even among &s;overeigns candour and rectitude are found to be their &s;afe&s;t politicks. All the &s;ubtilties, all the &s;hufflings of a famous mini&s;ter, on occa&s;ion of a very intere&s;ting treaty with re&s;pect to Spain, turned at length to his confu&s;ion, and the da|mage of his ma&s;ter; while the good faith, the genero&s;ity of England, towards her allies, pro|cured
<PB N="11" REF="031803_0012_0FEE74070D1BAAC8">her an immen&s;e credit, and rai&s;ed her to the highe&s;t point of influence and re&s;pect."</P>
<P>The compliment to Britain, which clo&s;es this pa&s;&s;age, we know, by bitter experience, how long &s;he has cea&s;ed to de&s;erve; and again&s;t it the rea&s;on of every American republican mu&s;t revolt, whether he reflects on the helli&s;h con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t the precious rights of human nature, which was formed by the combined powers, or whether he looks back upon a few of the latter pages of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and contemplates there atrocities again&s;t his countrymen, compared to which, the crimes of Rober&s;pierre him&s;elf would turn to whitene&s;s. It is evident, indeed, from the boa&s;ts of Mr. Pitt him&s;elf in parliament, that he piqued him&s;elf upon his in&s;idious artifices, and that in&s;tead of relaxing the oppre&s;&s;ive bonds, which bind our hands, it was his de&s;ign to &s;light no opportunity to draw the &s;tricture tighter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>ONLY into exi&s;ting treaties need we ca&s;t our eyes, to know how liberal and friendly were the wi&s;hes and de&s;igns of that nation, again&s;t which the tools and incendiaries of Briti&s;h poli|cy in America, are endeavouring, with unex|ampled acrimony and indu&s;try, to kindle our re&s;entment. The following are the words of the &s;econd article of the treaty of alliance even|tual and defen&s;ive with France:</P>
<P>"The e&s;&s;ential and direct end of the pre&s;ent defen&s;ive alliance is to maintain effectually the liberty, &s;overeignty, and independence, ab&s;olute
<PB N="12" REF="031803_0013_0FEE740D932F0A90">and unlimited of the &s;aid United States, as well in matters of government as of commerce."</P>
<P>The following is article the 9th:</P>
<P>"The contracting parties declare that, being re&s;olved to fulfil, each on its own part, the clau|&s;es and conditions in the pre&s;ent treaty of alliance, according to its own powers and circum&s;tances, there &s;hall be no after claim of compen&s;ation, on one &s;ide or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king renounces forever the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Bermuda, as well as of any part of the continent of North-Ame|rica, which, before the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called Briti&s;h co|lonies, or which are at this time, or have late|ly been under the power of Great-Britain."</P>
<P>Thus do we &s;ee that we were to lo&s;e nothing, and might gain immen&s;ely by the French alli|ance, the direct purpo&s;e thereof being the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the independence of America, while the manife&s;t, unequivocal, &s;y&s;tematick, de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h treaty is its de&s;truction. When, after all the&s;e in&s;tances of &s;ervice, a French mini&s;ter applied to your &s;ecretary at war for the loan of arms for their defence, what was his reply? that "the French government would not be &s;upplied with &s;o much as a &s;ingle pi&s;tol." Would not the Briti&s;h government, un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances, and in the in&s;olence of monarchy have demanded in&s;tantly, that we &s;hould join their arms, that we &s;hould not car|ry grain into an enemy's port, but &s;hould bring
<PB N="13" REF="031803_0014_0FEE740F1AD97960">it to their own? Nay, did &s;he not do this at la&s;t, and will &s;he not do it again, if ever another fooli&s;h and wicked hope is entertained that France can be &s;tarved? Does any man of honor &s;ay he doubts this? No not one. Whether we were right in giving no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to France &s;hall not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed here; but at lea&s;t let not this boa&s;ted neutrality of the treaty admini&s;tration be applauded by us, becau&s;e an enraged party in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons, wi&s;hing to exalt American policy at the expence of Mr. Pitt, thought proper to applaud it. Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan applauded what would &s;erve their country: they deprecated a war with America. Did the&s;e gentlemen arraign the policy of the American government, when, in its infatuated and mo&s;t mi&s;chievous devotion to Britain, an ig|nominious treaty was executed with that power, which pro&s;trated at her feet the honor and in|tere&s;ts of America, the intere&s;ts of France, and put at hazard the future &s;ervices of &s;o firm a friend, with the evident peril of converting her, by this act, into a mo&s;t virulent, as &s;he would, of cour&s;e, be a mo&s;t powerful foe? Certainly they did not. By the neutrality Britain was to pro&s;per, and they were plea&s;ed of cour&s;e; but when they found we had meanly de&s;erted the French, and thrown our&s;elves into the arms of Britain, they knew they would pro&s;per more, and were therefore &s;till better plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid the French, whatever they have been, are no longer our friends, and that it has become our duty as patriots, and men of honor, to enter into a conflict with them. Let us look into this bu&s;ine&s;s and then we will return
<PB N="14" REF="031803_0015_0FEE7410A2547B90">to the Briti&s;h, and the tendency of their treaty, and their politicks.</P>
<P>Three charges are brought again&s;t the French government: 1&s;t, That it has plundered our trade. 2d, That it has refu&s;ed to receive our mini&s;ter. 3d, That it has re&s;olved, in imita|tion of the Briti&s;h, to treat as a pirate, every American &s;eaman that &s;hall be found aboard of the enemy's &s;hips.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t of the&s;e charges it has been fal&s;e from fir&s;t to la&s;t; the &s;poliations committed both in Europe and America never having, as we have any rea&s;on to believe, been authorized by the executive of France. This point, &s;o far as relates to Europe, is proved by Co&s;&s;in's letter to the directory, demanding permi&s;&s;ion for the French merchants to crui&s;e again&s;t the Ame|rican trade. What at la&s;t has the directory done to embarra&s;s your commerce? They have allowed their armed ve&s;&s;els to bring in neutral &s;hips &s;u&s;pected of containing enemy's property, and have ordered, that as &s;oon as the condemned property is di&s;embarked, the ve&s;&s;el &s;hall be al|lowed to depart with full compen&s;ation for freight and detention. This, I apprehend, is the ge|neral &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s, encumbered, no doubt, with &s;ome inconvenient regulations. Compare this with the plunder of the Briti&s;h, and it will appear but as the teazing of a fly, compared with the ravening of a tiger.</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge which is to reconcile us to a war with men who &s;o long continued to love us, is, that, becau&s;e they thought we loved them no more, they &s;aid to our mini&s;ter, "Depart; you are not our friend, you give us no &s;ub&s;tan|tial
<PB N="15" REF="031803_0016_0FEE7412292BAC40">proofs of affection; you give us words in|deed, but words are air; you wi&s;h to give us more words, but our enemies you uphold with deeds; nay us you have agreed to &s;tarve." This charge is frivolous: it is di&s;gu&s;ting to unravel the woof of pa&s;&s;ion; to break a &s;pider's web is not the ta&s;k of manhood.</P>
<P>We come now to the mo&s;t weighty, the mo&s;t momentous charge of all; the directory have ordered your &s;eamen, taken in arms again&s;t them, while the two nations are at peace, to be treated as pirates. In this what do they but imitate the example of the Briti&s;h, authorized by your&s;elves in a treaty, which, intimidated, as it is confe&s;&s;ed on all hands, by the influence of the Briti&s;h na|tion, in an evil hour, your rulers deba&s;ed them|&s;elves by forming. After all then, what is the purpo&s;e of the French government in the adop|tion of the very wor&s;t of the mea&s;ures we com|plain of? Self-defence; the very purpo&s;e for which it is declared we took tho&s;e previous &s;teps which led to the&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us but retrace the ground we have trod|den, and the French will do the &s;ame, and we &s;hall both regain the po&s;t we have lo&s;t&mdash;the po&s;t of amity and peace.</P>
<P>Be it however admitted for a moment, that the French have been to blame; yet let not the cen&s;ure fall upon the nation, but upon the di|rectory, the political agents of the nation. Every people, be the form of its governments what it may, mu&s;t, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, experience the evils of an intemperate, or an unwi&s;e, ad|mini&s;tration. The pride or weakne&s;s of the treaty admini&s;tration brought this country into
<PB N="16" REF="031803_0017_0FEE74188712CA80">tho&s;e embara&s;&s;ments, which &s;o puzzle the will in the election of the le&s;&s;er evil. To quarrel with a nation on account of its ruling admini&s;|tration (unle&s;s the form of the government al|lows no change to the aggrieved citizens) is to encourage one bad admini&s;tration to provoke another for in&s;idious purpo&s;es, which very thing (&s;uppo&s;ing that of the French had been a bad one) would appear to have been done in &s;everal late American tran&s;actions; more e&s;pecially in the late laboured mi&s;chief of Mr. Secretary Pickering. If the rulers have been faulty, let it not be &s;aid as of old,
<Q>Dum delirant reges plectunter achivi.</Q> But even &s;uppo&s;ing the nation of France it&s;elf to be oppo&s;ed to us, even this is not a &s;ufficient warrant to the cool, deliberate judgment for us to become their enemies who have been &s;o long their friends, or (which to the heart of grati|tude is more) <HI>we to whom they</HI> have &s;o long been friends. Fir&s;t, without more information than falls to the &s;hare of the million, the French people might ea&s;ily fall into the error of believ|ing the American people were their enemies, &s;ince our government has given the fulle&s;t te&s;ti|mony of a rooted hate. Secondly, in publick, as in private, friend&s;hip, he is mo&s;t a hero who forbears the mo&s;t. Between long e&s;tabli&s;hed friends, as Americans and Frenchmen, forbear|ance leads to reconciliation; between long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed foes, as Americans and Britons, forbear|ance leads to arrogance in one, to meanne&s;s in the other. Which is be&s;t, to yield &s;omething to a long tried friend, or be the &s;hallow dupe of an inveterate national enemy, and her vile or wicked
<PB N="17" REF="031803_0018_0FEE741A18736E10">agents, and adherents, in the very heart of your government.</P>
<P>But after all what is it the French de&s;ire that you &s;hould do? To abandon certain articles of a treaty, which has been made in de&s;pight of the mandates of your con&s;titution, and which there|fore it ought to be your mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h, and unalterable purpo&s;e, immediately to abandon in toto. Will it be &s;aid that we &s;hould he&s;itate to take this &s;tep, le&s;t we &s;hould incur the imputa|tion of timidity? If we have not already incur|red this imputation, by a mo&s;t ignoble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the adoption of the Briti&s;h treaty, are we likely now to do &s;o by a rea&s;onable and honora|ble compromi&s;e with di&s;gu&s;ted friends? In pri|vate life does a man of honor he&s;itate to ac|knowledge an offence, if he has offended? or to repair an injury if he has injured? And does he not the&s;e things with the greater readine&s;s, in proportion to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his reputation? Do Americans feel them&s;elves &s;u&s;pected? Will not the character of their valour <HI>afford</HI> an apo|logy? Will not their achievements in the revo|lution war, bear them out of a di&s;pute without a battle? Is it not evident, that by the confe&s;|&s;ion of error, we &s;hall mo&s;t effectually a&s;&s;ert our national honor? Let the treaty be abandoned, as it ought, upon the principle of national in|tere&s;t; let the mea&s;ure be declared nece&s;&s;ary to the legal admini&s;tration of the government, and the independence of the republick; then it &s;ure|ly will be no objection to this act that it will be agreeable to the French. Rid your&s;elves of your thraldom, not becau&s;e the French wi&s;h it, but becau&s;e it becomes you as men of &s;pirit. Would
<PB N="18" REF="031803_0019_0FEE741BA47CC260">you do a wrong thing, merely becau&s;e the French have hoped you would do a right one? Had we acted rightly in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, we &s;hould not have been called to do &s;o now. Nay, if after the rejection of one mini&s;ter, the recep|tion of another &s;hould become a que&s;tion, even this would be no objection to the abandonment of the treaty. If violations of the con&s;titution are tolerated in ca&s;es which militate again&s;t the publick weal, how familiar will the violations become in ca&s;es which pre&s;ent &s;ome partial good? And how &s;oon &s;hall we have no con&s;titution at all? It has been matter of curio&s;ity to &s;ee in governments, where liberty has been yielded up in de&s;pair, how in&s;urrections have taken place from the mo&s;t trifling impo&s;itions; as when a king of Spain attempted to regulate the dre&s;s of his &s;ub|jects; or a king of France, or England, to de|prive the citizens of a publick walk: yet even in tho&s;e &s;tates, which are eminently free, the ga|ping multitude can gaze with &s;ilent inactivity, when de&s;igns, which cannot be mi&s;taken, again&s;t their mo&s;t precious rights, are in daily progre&s;s and maturation. Philip would have met with more prompt and formidable oppo&s;ition from the people of Athens, had he threatened to &s;uppre&s;s their favorite &s;pectacles, than he did when he advanced to &s;ubvert the republick.</P>

<P>BUT the truth is, that we are now brought into a po&s;ition in which we can no longer temporize, but mu&s;t take up &s;ome part, either
<PB N="19" REF="031803_0020_0FEE741D2CA2C5E8">much more abject than any played even in the treaty drama, or much more manly and deci&s;ive than the wretched actors in tho&s;e wretched &s;cenes, ever hoped to &s;ee us execute. We mu&s;t, forthwith, accommodate our&s;elves to one of three things: 1&s;t, To &s;ee our &s;eamen pre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h government, and then hanged by the French: or 2dly, we mu&s;t fight the nation of France: or 3dly, we mu&s;t abandon the Briti&s;h treaty. By this la&s;t mea&s;ure, I apprehend, we &s;hall be in no danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed by, or fighting, either.</P>
<P>Now after all that has been &s;aid, about the hu|miliation of being under the influence of French politicks, in any degree, even the &s;malle&s;t, (for we have &s;een that very little has been attempted, and <HI>that</HI> in their own defence, and to no de|triment of ours,) let me a&s;k, is there any weak nation, that is not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, under the guidance of its &s;tronger neighbour? There &s;eems &s;carcely an in&s;tance to the contrary, but in the little republick of St. Marino, which is perched like an eagle's ne&s;t amid&s;t the clouds. And indeed it is remarkable, that as the French are anxious, in all in&s;tances, to propagate the principles of republican government, or in other words, as will be believed by all but the Briti&s;h faction among us, the principles of permanent freedom, &s;o in the in&s;tance even of the unim|portant e&s;tabli&s;hment we &s;peak of, they did not di&s;dain to pau&s;e, amid&s;t their great career, to &s;peak their kindne&s;s. But let me a&s;k; does not your treaty with Great Britain, now rule your politicks with a rod of iron? France wi&s;hes you to con&s;ult her views, in one in&s;tance, wherein
<PB N="20" REF="031803_0021_0FEE742265A1C230">it is your evident intere&s;t and glory to comply; England, that you &s;hould truckle to her will, in every in&s;tance, which now, or ever may exi&s;t: yet you are indignant at the attempt of a nation &s;o long your friend, to break tho&s;e bonds. No man deprecates, more fervently than I, the prevalence of foreign influence; yet, where a certain portion is inevitably to be &s;u&s;tained, &s;urely that is to be preferred, which, from the habitual attachments, and character of the go|vernment, may be expected to act with &s;uperior mildne&s;s. France, we &s;ee, is powerful, and loves republican governments; while England, if &s;he is powerful, is al&s;o inimical to republicks; and &s;hould &s;he be a republick tomorrow, and prior claims of the French upon our &s;ervices &s;tood not in the way, mo&s;t willingly ought we to forget all the animo&s;ities which prevail under the monarchy, and join our friendly hands. As to the point of accommodation with a &s;uperior nation, it ought to be remembered, that not|with&s;tanding the di&s;tance of our country from the republick of France, the condition of the pea&s;antry of the &s;outhern &s;tates, renders one half of the union extremely feeble, and this weak|ne&s;s is encrea&s;ed by the complexion of French politicks in this particular. Were every man in America a freeman, we might encounter France with &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; but where a con|flict is evidently hopele&s;s, it is not fear, but rea|&s;on, which &s;hould decline it; it is not valour, but madne&s;s, which &s;hould attempt it. The Briti&s;h navy, if it remains (and whether it will long &s;urvive the pal&s;y of the bank of England may very well be que&s;tioned) may injure us in
<PB N="21" REF="031803_0022_0FEE742535C9E5C0">the &s;poil of &s;uch property as we may choo&s;e to venture on the &s;eas, (for the meane&s;t tool of Britain thinks her not capable of a &s;econd terrene war;) but the potency of myriads of heroes, flu&s;hed with unexampled victories, who &s;hall attempt to calculate. Does not every man of &s;en&s;e &s;ee too, that, &s;ince their late &s;ucce&s;&s;es a|gain&s;t the emperor and the Italian &s;tates, the French &s;hortly "mu&s;t &s;heath their &s;words for lack of argument;" then, &s;hould the directory be covetous of glory, as their enemies a&s;&s;ert, where can they wave their banners with greater gain of territory than on the we&s;tern &s;hores of the Atlantic; and while they are di&s;banding one half of their army in the Ea&s;t, who &s;hall declare, that if we become their enemies, they will not, with the other half, attempt to plant another empire in the we&s;t? In &s;uch a ca&s;e who doubts that they would delight in an opportunity of crippling the trade of Britain in America, upon the &s;ame principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation which carried them into the territory of Italy. Who then &s;hall fight your battles? The we&s;tern pea|&s;antry are out of the attraction of Briti&s;h policy, and love the French. While &s;uch are the pur|&s;uits of the French, be it al&s;o our part, in like manner, to adopt the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion, founded too, as they &s;urely are, upon the principles of national honor and dignity. The Briti&s;h, we &s;ee manife&s;tly, cannot &s;ubdue the French; but what if the French &s;ubdue the Bri|ti&s;h, the preciousally of the treaty admini&s;tration? What, under &s;uch circum&s;tances of imbecility, as above de&s;cribed, will be the &s;ituation of the &s;outhern &s;tates, more e&s;pecially, &s;unk as they
<PB N="22" REF="031803_0023_0FEE7426C1A1ADC8">will be by the combined oppre&s;&s;ions of di&s;ap|pointment, ingratitude, and de&s;pair? Let the French land when they will in the &s;outhern &s;tates, whether before or after the conque&s;t of England, whether before or after the attainment of the Floridas, at that ill-fated hour tho&s;e &s;tates will be di&s;membered from tho&s;e of the north, and ea&s;t, and we&s;t. Then will the northern &s;tates, if not likewi&s;e &s;ubdued by the French, &s;ink, without hope of re&s;urrection, into the deep aby&s;s of Briti&s;h politicks; for the influence of it is baleful and univer&s;al as its reach; like the dog|&s;tar, it falls with indi&s;criminate rage upon every nation in all the regions of the habitable globe, and upon every tribe. But of this more here|after.</P>

<P>IF, as has been urged, the Briti&s;h treaty is un|con&s;titutional, (and this is a point not con|te&s;ted, that I know of, even by its patrons) and if it is at variance with the laws of nations, it will &s;urely not be objected to the abandonment thereof, that our national faith will be violated. On the contrary, this happy con&s;equence will re&s;ult from the mea&s;ure; it will put intriguing nations upon their guard, in future, that they make no compact with flagitious rulers in Ame|rica, when her laws do not uphold their acts. And what, let me a&s;k, &s;hall we abandon in the treaty? The greate&s;t cur&s;e (formed by a com|plication of cur&s;es,) that ever vi&s;ited an incau|tious, oppre&s;&s;ed, di&s;honored nation. It is not
<PB N="23" REF="031803_0024_0FEE742ACC168350">misfortune, but ruin; nay it is wor&s;e, it is an|nihilation. The treaty is not one of many evils which like congregating &s;treams fill up a mighty torrent to bur&s;t upon its haple&s;s neighbours; it is an earthquake, which with wide and wa&s;teful bane, yawns to engorge the nation. Why did we &s;urrender our birthright to tho&s;e haughty lordlings, even while their kingdom was totter|ing to its fall? Nor did we gain a me&s;s of pot|tage in return. In&s;tead of drawing tighter the bonds of union, we &s;hould have rent a&s;under the ignominious mi&s;chief, like Samp&s;on in his &s;trength, and not have &s;uffered this Briti&s;h trea|ty to en&s;lave our limbs. By acts of alienation, and not by ties of friend&s;hip, have we four times been re&s;cued from the gra&s;p of Britain: in two in&s;tances by the non-importation agreements which followed the &s;tamp and tea acts; in two others by the declaration of independence, and the treaty of alliance with France; which two in&s;truments e&s;tabli&s;hed our empire. Have we not formed a league with our implacable foe, as mon&s;trous as between a tyger and a lamb? for the character of monarchy, of Britain above all monarchies, is bloody and ravening; the character of repre&s;entative government is peace|ful and unoffending. The laws of nations, them&s;elves, even when a <HI>legal</HI> treaty is formed, between a monarchy and a republick, give the former immen&s;e advantages over the latter. Vattel makes a di&s;tinction between a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and a <HI>real</HI> alliance; the former, he &s;ays, "ex|pires with him who contracted it;" the latter "is affixed to the body of the &s;tate, and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts as long as the &s;tate; if the time of its du|ration
<PB N="24" REF="031803_0025_0FEE742D97C4A3F8">is not limitted. He then &s;ubjoins, "eve|ry alliance made by a republick is in its own na|ture real, for it relates only to the body of the &s;tate. When a free people, a popular &s;tate, or an ari&s;tocratical republick, concludes a treaty, it is the &s;tate it&s;elf that contracts; and its en|gagements do not depend on the lives of tho&s;e who were only the in&s;truments: the members of the people, or of the regency, change and &s;uc|ceed each other; but the &s;tate is always the &s;ame." If then republicks always remain bound, while monarchies may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be let off from their engagements, it is evident that &s;uch treaties &s;hould not, but in ca&s;es of inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, to be entered into. The &s;ame writer adds, "when kings make treaties, and it is doubtful whether they be real or per&s;onal, they &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to be only per&s;onal, if ex|tremely burden&s;ome to one party." But burden|&s;ome as this treaty is to the people, though light as the go&s;samer to the admini&s;tration which have given it birth, yet, becau&s;e our government is a republick, we, had it been a legal act, mu&s;t &s;till have born the weight forever, though we &s;hould have groaned like Atlas beneath the world; whereas a treaty which had been found an encumbrance to Britain, might, in many in|&s;tances, have been got rid of as a per&s;onal one, by her, by the death of a prince. In monar|chies too we find there is no publick faith but what is founded on convenience; we ought not to have made a treaty with the French monarchy, but that it &s;eemed the only mean by which to hope for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our freedom. We have now, on the contrary, entered into a trea|ty
<PB N="25" REF="031803_0026_0FEE742F1F63A8E8">which will make us &s;laves. The confidence which men of ob&s;ervation place in monarchs is &s;o &s;mall, that the only rea&s;on why we could hope to avoid the evils of a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters"> treaty, between George the IIId and Lewis XVIth was, that Lewis mu&s;t have known, that, in that event we &s;hould have cho&s;en the ma&s;ter we were to obey, and that habit, the milder maxims of the Bri|ti&s;h government of that day, and indignation at &s;uch treachery, would have decided in favor of George. When, too, we have &s;een kings, and the mini&s;ters of kings, bowing their humbled heads beneath the laurels of Rome and Paris, and when nothing but the pre&s;ervation of our principles is needful to the &s;ame a&s;cen&s;ion, &s;hall we meanly &s;eek relation to the&s;e the meane&s;t, and mo&s;t hate|ful of mankind, the fooli&s;h, and the wicked? What &s;ecurity have we from a government which has been faithle&s;s to its own citizens? A while the liberty, as well as the property, or an <HI>indi|vidual</HI> Engli&s;hman was left inviolate, to ma&s;k the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the <HI>publick</HI> weal. The French re|volution, it was feared, would redeem the liber|ty and the property of the citizens, both publick and private; private liberty has therefore been invaded in the per&s;ons of &s;ome daring patriots; and the like will be the fate of private property, as &s;oon as the exigencies of the &s;tate, and the fe|licities of opportunity, &s;hall pre&s;ent them&s;elves together. If thus they treat the citizens of their own immediate government, their friends and brethren, what &s;hall we expect? We whom they view but as refractory &s;ubjects? Certainly that they will keep no terms with &s;uch. Do we not know that a flagrant violation of faith hap|pened
<PB N="26" REF="031803_0027_0FEE7430A4E298B0">after the capitulation of Charle&s;ton, when they &s;aid they would not fulfil compacts made with rebels? What though they &s;ince have ac|knowledged the independence of the govern|ment? That would a&s;&s;uredly but weigh with them as lightly as any other principle of honor or good faith: they would allege, that they made their compact through nece&s;&s;ity: a nece&s;&s;ity ari|&s;ing out of their de&s;igns upon our liberty; and they would deride our claims accordingly. Who doubts the readine&s;s of Spain to re&s;ume the long relinqui&s;hed &s;overeignty of Holland? To what end are even the laws of nations re&s;orted to by princes, when the laws of nature have been vi|olated? Is it not, as Satan quotes &s;cripture for his purpo&s;e? Camillus, to obtain our favor for the treaty, points out &s;ome arrogant demands which Britain had forborn in con&s;equence of the treaty. And will the treaty make this &s;poiler mode&s;t? It will as &s;oon tran&s;mute Corinthian bra&s;s to gold, or die with virgin blu&s;hes the gha&s;tly, pallid cheek of veteran guilt. The &s;ame writer tells us the treaty was made to &s;ecure us from a war. Great care might have been expected to be taken in this treaty to &s;ecure us from a war, when the be&s;t &s;e|curity from that grievous burden, and no incon|&s;iderable fund for its &s;upport, were &s;urrendered by the treaty; But who &s;hall &s;ecure us from a war with perfidy? Can honor agree with infamy? Humanity with barbari&s;m? Are not political e|normities even familiar to that government? Have we forgot already the dungeons and pri&s;on &s;hips of the revolution? Cruelties committed where there was no retaliation, and (mean as atrocious!) <HI>be|cau&s;e</HI> there was no retaliation. If then it was
<PB N="27" REF="031803_0028_0FEE74371BF4AD60">likely we mu&s;t have a war at la&s;t, and that we could only repo&s;e our&s;elves in peace and infamy, better had it been to have had this war at fir&s;t: then &s;hould we not only have pre&s;erved tho&s;e re|&s;ources in wealth which are &s;poken of above, but we &s;hould al&s;o have pre&s;erved the attachment of our friends, and probably been included by their good offices in that peace which Britain is about to &s;ue for at the feet of France. Whether &s;uch acts of friend&s;hip are &s;till to be expected from them, &s;hould we require and de&s;erve them, will not admit of doubt. How much better had it been to have braved the fury of this Briti&s;h lion, or this Briti&s;h &s;hark? Would not the memory of former mi&s;carriages have checked the ravings even of Briti&s;h arrogance? Surely no nation, baffled and confounded as Britain has been in her attempts to cru&s;h the germs of liberty, both in America and France, had ever better rea&s;on, in|&s;tead of expecting an advantageous treaty from America, to dread her &s;miting hand, and to ex|claim with the vanqui&s;hed Trojan:

<P>IN &s;ome of the foregoing rea&s;onings, we have enquired, whether it would be honorable, and (if we wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the purity of re|publican principles) whether it would be pru|dent to quarrel with an old friend, again&s;t whom we feel a &s;udden di&s;gu&s;t, and to connect our|&s;elves with a long e&s;tabli&s;hed foe. We did not
<PB N="28" REF="031803_0029_0FEE7438A32BFF70">then enter into the que&s;tion, whether this foe could, or could not afford us the &s;upport which we once received from the friend we have lately lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In familiar di&s;cour&s;e, when we are di&s;po&s;ed to mark an immen&s;e di&s;proportion between two objects, we are apt to &s;ay there is no compari&s;on between them. Upon this principle we will forbear to &s;peak of the re&s;pective achievements of the two military nations, between whom it may become nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould make an election, for the purpo&s;e of a defen&s;ive alliance.</P>
<P>Within twenty years the Briti&s;h government has twice been engaged in war; and the unque&s;|tionable object of either conte&s;t, has been the extingui&s;hment of republicani&s;m, and the fall of liberty. In the&s;e unhallowed attempts Britain has expended two hundred millions &s;terling; and her national bank has at la&s;t &s;topped payment; a calamity, which, until it was felt, was depreca|ted as the &s;ure&s;t &s;ource of univer&s;al ruin. The two modes, by which the expences of the pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s of Britain are defrayed, are the&s;e: Taxation and loans; but taxes are paid in bank notes, and &s;o is the intere&s;t of loans. Now if the value of bank notes is lo&s;t, what will be the value of taxes? and who will lend money to government?</P>
<P>But as &s;ome doubt may be entertained, whe|ther, notwith&s;tanding an occa&s;ional &s;toppage of payment, the bank may not yet be in a flouri&s;h|ing condition, let us advert to &s;ome late tran&s;|actions of the Briti&s;h government, relative to the bu&s;ine&s;s we now &s;peak of.</P>

By an order of council, ab&s;olute and uncon|&s;titutional, advocated by the plea of &s;ad nece&s;|&s;ity, the bank of England is &s;uddenly forbidden to i&s;&s;ue &s;pecie. What is the immediate con&s;e|quence? The credit of the bank is impaired, the notes depreciate. Do the directors of the bank hereupon remon&s;trate with the council, and demand permi&s;&s;ion to change their notes as u&s;ual, that they may re&s;tore their credit? No: they do no more than tell the people, in ge|neral terms, that the bank remains in a &s;tate of pro&s;perity. Do the people believe the tale? Ignorance it&s;elf, made drunk, would not believe it.</P>
<P>What &s;cene of this inimitable farce comes next? The mini&s;ter propo&s;es, that a committee of the hou&s;e of commons be appointed to exa|mine into the cau&s;es of the late mea&s;ure of coun|cil, and to a&s;certain the &s;tability of public credit. Well; this committee are to return into the hou&s;e of commons, and, that the minds of men may be &s;et at re&s;t about the public credit, the committee are to report what they have &s;een at the bank; are they not? Nothing like it, good citizen of England; the mini&s;ter tells you, you are &s;atisfied already; and does not he know be&s;t? Do but hear his words: "When this commit|tee was appointed, it would be evident that it was not for the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining, <HI>what indeed had already been a&s;certained by publick opinion,</HI> the &s;olidity of the bank of England; but to confirm that impre&s;&s;ion by the mo&s;t in|di&s;putable evidence." Would not any one &s;up|po&s;e, that this man was, to the very la&s;t hour, picking the pockets of the publick, and, at the
<PB N="30" REF="031803_0031_0FEE743BB1B4CAE0">&s;ame time, like the man who promi&s;ed to jump into a quart bottle, meditating his e&s;cape with the plunder? This new principle of confirming, by new evidence, what was not before believed, is perhaps the &s;trange&s;t that has ever been adopt|ed, even by the brazen hardihood of a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter; and it well may be &s;o, for the occa|&s;ion it&s;elf is without an example. But who are the&s;e di&s;ciples of Mr. Pitt, who are thus to give <HI>more</HI> faith to unbelievers? They are, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the creatures of his hand; next, they are a committee of <HI>&s;ecrecy;</HI> and even they them&s;elves, "may not go into the more minute and delicate branches of the company's tran&s;ac|tions, provided they certify the grounds of the nece&s;&s;ity, which ju&s;tified the late mea&s;ure." This, I think, is looking up the bible, and in|viting good chri&s;tians to believe. Be&s;ides, let us &s;uppo&s;e the committee "&s;hall certify the grounds of the nece&s;&s;ity which ju&s;tified the late mea&s;ure," Does this e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the &s;o|lidity of the bank? The be&s;t ground for &s;top|ping the emi&s;&s;ion of &s;pecie, I apprehend, is the want of it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e notable tran&s;actions, we may &s;up|po&s;e the curtain will drop upon the cata&s;trophe of this tragi-comedy, and there remain, perhaps, till it &s;hall ri&s;e again upon a tragedy, wherein not one &s;cene of comedy will be introduced.</P>
<P>An attempt has been made to hoodwink rea&s;on, by comparing former calamities to that which embarra&s;&s;es the Engli&s;h bank at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is. The run on the bank at the time of the Scotch inva&s;ion was a ca&s;e entirely di&s;tingui&s;hed from the pre&s;ent: payment was then made, though
<PB N="31" REF="031803_0032_0FEE74421A26A808">&s;lowly; be&s;ides, as the cau&s;e was &s;udden and of &s;hort duration, &s;o al&s;o was the effect. But the cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent mi&s;chief are the the im|men&s;e expenditures of &s;pecie abroad, and per|haps the con&s;equent alarm of the monied men, who cho&s;e to &s;ecure in time what ca&s;h they might collect. By what means the travelling guineas will return to England we know not, unle&s;s the French &s;hall bring them to &s;upport their armies; and we are then to learn how their di&s;mayed foe is to &s;upport his own. As to the hidden trea&s;ure which has &s;unk into the ca&s;kets of the &s;ubject, the man who &s;ent it there is not likely to conjure it up again. As to the plan talked of to re&s;tore credit by a mortgage of real property, both rea|&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion will revolt at the idea: monied men have been &s;upported by the de&s;poti&s;m of the Briti&s;h government, and they have given their &s;upport in turn, till they are like to &s;ink beneath its weight: warned by this example, and &s;afe in their &s;afe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the men who hold the &s;oil will not put it to hazard to &s;oothe a tyrant's brea&s;t; but &s;tart up in their now unrivalled &s;trength, and brave the &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the &s;toppage of the bank, which took place in the time of William III. is as little in point. There was, at that time, no immen&s;e emi&s;&s;ion of bills to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es of guineas; a fair acknowledgment of the pre&s;ent government, that there is no intention to i&s;&s;ue any con&s;iderable number of guineas: be&s;ides, the termination of a war put a period to the pa|nick of avarice.</P>
<P>The natural con&s;equence of a bank's &s;topping payment is one of the&s;e; if it remain &s;hut,
<PB N="32" REF="031803_0033_0FEE7443B7162470">notes will depreciate, we know not to what degree. If &s;pecie be again &s;ent out, demands, of cour&s;e, are made much greater than tho&s;e which helped to cau&s;e the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of its circulation.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be urged, that a peace may turn the re&s;ources of Britain into a lucrative channel, and fill the bank once more. But does any man of ob&s;ervation believe, that the French will make &s;uch a peace, as will leave the Briti&s;h marine in a &s;tate to pre&s;erve entire the influence of their military and commercial power? Such a peace as will keep in after check, perhaps in annihilation, the navy and the trade of France?</P>
<P>If it be urged, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of a nation has before this time been &s;u&s;tained in its opera|tions by a paper currency, let it be remembered, that the money of the American revolution (which by the way did not depreciate, it is &s;aid, for the fir&s;t year, while bank notes have depre|ciated the fir&s;t day of their emi&s;&s;ion,) was &s;ent forth by degrees, and was employed to defend us again&s;t a di&s;tant foe, who fought at a very unequal expence; and it would not at la&s;t have e&s;tabli&s;hed our empire without the aid of France: for it had peri&s;hed before the fall of Yorktown under the arms of the allies; which event put a period to the conte&s;t with Britain. The French a&s;&s;ignats depreciated al&s;o with great ra|pidity, and the government was obliged to have recour&s;e to their immen&s;e re&s;ources of eighty millions of &s;pecie. Be&s;ides, the battles of France have been chiefly carried into the territories of their enemies; an advantage well known to mi|litary men. But the Briti&s;h have i&s;&s;ued, in ad|dition to their former enormous emi&s;&s;ions, four|teen
<PB N="33" REF="031803_0034_0FEE744541928EB0">millions, with no re&s;ources of trea&s;ure, that we know of, in re&s;erve. This paper me|dium is, perhaps intended to carry on a naval war, which yields no commercial &s;poil to an enemy, with a power, which only a tempe&s;t could fru&s;trate in his de&s;ign to ca&s;t the crown of Ireland beneath the peoples feet; a power, which will &s;hortly &s;et his foot upon the Briti&s;h throne, and &s;purn it to the du&s;t.</P>
<P>"But (&s;ay the advocates of the Briti&s;h fac|tion) we admit the probability of the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the bank; many thou&s;ands will be ruined, yet will England ri&s;e up in her &s;trength, unen|cumbered by her weight of debt." This ca&s;e is &s;imilar to the old ca&s;e of Antaeus, who was the &s;on of the earth, from which he received new vigor at every fall; 'till Hercules, impatient at the conte&s;t, uprai&s;ed him in the air, and &s;cat|tered his brains in the winds. The fate of Eng|land may not, perhaps, be more au&s;picious. If any rea&s;onings may be called fanciful, they &s;urely are &s;uch as the&s;e. When a convul&s;ion &s;hall have terminated, &s;hall a phy&s;ician promi&s;e health to the weary patient? But England's re&s;urrection, if ever &s;he &s;hall ri&s;e again from the ruins of the bank, mu&s;t be in the form of a republick. The monied men, who &s;hall tumble with the monar|chy, will favor tho&s;e plans of economy which &s;uit the &s;tate of an empoveri&s;hed man: the whole ma&s;s of the needy million will do the &s;ame. The di&s;&s;enters will a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with ar|dor, with tho&s;e men who will extingui&s;h their di&s;abilities, and give them power, wealth, civil and religious freedom. If then, this republick is to be a liberal one, we have nothing thence
<PB N="34" REF="031803_0035_0FEE7446C90B6E00">to dread, if we &s;hall have acted upon the prin|ciples of republicans: if it &s;hall not be liberal, we mu&s;t have rea&s;on to repent the connexion we have formed with the exi&s;ting monarchy. Be&s;ides, if the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem is not doomed to &s;tand, the Engli&s;h admini&s;tration mu&s;t make their new arrangements under the eye of France; mu&s;t manoeuvre in the pre&s;ence of an enemy, who will take advantage of her confu&s;ion, and has long &s;ought &s;o precious an occa&s;ion to cru&s;h that power, which bound his hands &s;o long. Away then forever with the&s;e Engli&s;h mini&s;ters! the&s;e men in iron ma&s;ks, whom no one but their keeper knows, and knows them for their mi&s;|chiefs. For the mean nodding trifler, who dreams of Briti&s;h faith and power, let him &s;till &s;lumber in his paradi&s;e of fools, 'till with a fu|ry's &s;courge the parricide &s;hall wake to angui&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a matter of notoriety, that the clamours of the commercial citizens of America, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Philadelphia, had no incon&s;iderable weight in the origination of the treaty. The appropriations for carrying it into effect had been negatived in a committee of the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives by a majority of twenty, and in a few days after, without any change of circum&s;tances, but the increa&s;ed im|patience of tho&s;e citizens, the appropriations were granted in the hou&s;e it&s;elf. It is very na|tural for trading men to wi&s;h for a connexion with a power, which they fancy to be capable
<PB N="35" REF="031803_0036_0FEE744D44CEE560">of protecting them in their commercial relations, and of offering to their election the great and va|ried objects of commerce. But let not the true in|tere&s;ts of America be made a &s;acrifice to party; nor let liberty be given in barter for the unex|hau&s;ted, or inexhau&s;tible mines, of the &s;outh. Too long did the late abject and wicked admini|&s;tration re&s;t their feeble &s;y&s;tem upon the crutch of avarice; but let the indignant yeoman kick down at length the faithle&s;s prop, and plant the tree of liberty where it &s;tood. In the com|mencement of our revolution war, the cities of London and Bri&s;tol recommended to the Briti&s;h parliament, that the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued, and they would give them the fulle&s;t &s;upport. In a year or two after, when they di&s;covered that England had not the character of omnipotence, and that their com|merce was interrupted and de&s;olated by the war, they pre&s;ented their &s;econd petitions, praying for an immediate peace. In like manner the commercial faction in America, deprecated at fir&s;t, nothing &s;o much as a war with Britain, but if the credit of the bank of England &s;hall run its mortal cour&s;e, it is to be expected that the&s;e gentlemen, as eagerly as the mo&s;t &s;tern republi|can, will demand the termination of our Briti&s;h connexions.</P>
<P>From this &s;o coveted commerce with Great Britain, has &s;prung the arch terror, the Briti&s;h treaty; and this mon&s;ter &s;hall be the mother of others, as multitudinous as the vipers of A|frica. But when we &s;hall feel the&s;e reptiles' &s;ting, where &s;hall we &s;eek the remedy? Will Britain mini&s;ter it? Britain will mini&s;ter nou|ri&s;hment
<PB N="36" REF="031803_0037_0FEE744ECCB05250">to the &s;erpent. Kill then the pre&s;ent mon&s;ter 'ere &s;he breed. Cut off, or reduce that pernicious intimacy which gluts the pride of Bri|tain, while it breaks the &s;pirit, while it cor|rupts the morals of America. Can any inter|cour&s;e be more unnatural, than that which en|riches a foe, provokes a friend, and drains from us the means of re&s;i&s;ting the attacks of either?</P>
<P>This brings us to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, which &s;eems hitherto to have occupied much too &s;mall a &s;hare of the concern and attention of the publick. It is well known that the fop|peries of Europe, and of England in particular, are poured into the republican &s;tates of Ameri|ca, to an extent that has affected the principles and the manners of the people; to an extent which has excited the wonder, and the contempt of di&s;cerning foreigners. This influx of tran&s;|atlantick commodities, co-operating with the funding &s;y&s;tem, has converted into mi&s;ers the men of bu&s;ine&s;s; and the idle gentry into fa&s;ti|dious triflers. Break at once the&s;e bonds, which like a felon's chains di&s;grace our hands, and re|&s;train our actions! Promote the culture of tho&s;e articles which are in demand in Europe; but bring not back returns which &s;ink or unnerve the character. Promote, at home, the pro&s;per|ity of tho&s;e manufactures which render the country, in all &s;ufficient mea&s;ure, independent of the aid of others; and in exchange for pro|duce receive &s;o much &s;pecie, as coming in &s;up|port of freedom, forms the be&s;t &s;upport of your independence.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t &s;een the Briti&s;h nation thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and threatened
<PB N="37" REF="031803_0038_0FEE745053C6DDC0">with pre&s;ent ruin, by the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e cu&s;|tomary &s;upplies of &s;pecie, which have been exhau&s;ted by a war. And does any man doubt that Britain, &s;o long as the 14th and 15th arti|cles of the treaty remain, will perpetually inun|date us with good, fir&s;t to enrich her&s;elf; &s;e|condly to keep the balance of trade again&s;t us, or &s;o little in our favor as to drain us of the cur|rent coin. Trade, in its pre&s;ent va&s;t extent, is injurious in the extreme, more particularly as it is conducted with Britain; which perhaps has more the advantage of us, in the conveniencies ari&s;ing from the balance of trade, than all the powers of Europe taken together: and were &s;uch duties laid upon the commodities of the whole, as would an&s;wer the purpo&s;es we &s;peak of, the mea&s;ure would probably be mi&s;under|&s;tood by the people, and be con&s;idered as an in|tollerable burden, and enormous grievance. By unre&s;trained commerce, we know that the great|e&s;t ma&s;s of wealth may be accumulated; but &s;pecie is the mo&s;t u&s;eful wealth, next to the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, and is even requi&s;ite to the de|fence of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries. Great manufacturing countries, with great re&s;ources in &s;pecie, have neverthele&s;s rendered their manufactures extreme|ly beneficial to them, as the means of prevent|ing the exportation of &s;pecie in great foreign wars. A war has co&s;t Great Britain &s;everal times the amount of its whole circulating &s;pecie; yet this money did not go out and return in large &s;ums; the circulating &s;pecie, therefore, could not be the &s;upport of the war; but manufactures, and bills purcha&s;ed therewith. (Adam Smith, b. 4, chap. 1.) What then would be our re&s;ources,
<PB N="38" REF="031803_0039_0FEE7451DB67CEE0">not only in a foreign war, but a war of defence, &s;ince we have neither &s;pecie nor manufactures, and who, it is admitted, ought not, with &s;uch tracts of uncultivated land, to carry manufac|tures to a great extent, except in tho&s;e in&s;tances wherein facilities are formed by machinery, which older &s;tates reject, to give employment to their population. The Spartans, it is true, de|fended them&s;elves without the precious metals; but our plans of government and &s;ocial habits are of characters utterly di&s;tinct from theirs, which we know were eminently rigid, &s;elf-deny|ing, and par&s;imonious. Since then circum&s;tan|ces are not likely to change in the pre&s;ent, or perhaps in any other &s;tate of philo&s;ophical im|provement, let us at lea&s;t not add to the evils of avarice the evils of paper money; more e&s;peci|ally becau&s;e the&s;e la&s;t do, in a very ob&s;ervable manner, conduce to the propagation of the fir&s;t. Be&s;ides the Spartans were &s;ometimes reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing &s;pecie from monarchs, a mea&s;ure greatly to be deprecated, for rea&s;ons which will be &s;ugge&s;ted by what has gone before.</P>
<P>There is a great error in &s;uppo&s;ing that wealth ought to be the fir&s;t con&s;ideration in the plans of every government; and yet this error &s;eems to prevail in a mo&s;t pernicious degree. When wealth is the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, liberty is not allowed to be the &s;econd; for wealth engro&s;&s;es the whole man. Thus has fallen the democracy of England. So when different &s;pecies of wealth pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our election,&mdash;that which upholds the freedom of the government&mdash;and that which enriches and enfeebles it&mdash;let us not he&s;itate to prefer the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="031803_0040_0FEE74583614D940">
Adam Smith complains, that money <HI>only</HI> is apt to be con&s;idered as wealth. Whatever com|mercial arrangements have been made upon this principle, were undoubtedly wrong; for money, correctly &s;peaking, is but the current repre&s;en|tative of wealth, and is of no u&s;e without it. But whatever was intended to encourage ex|portation, and re&s;train importation, &s;o far as might be nece&s;&s;ary to the admi&s;&s;ion of a circu|lating medium, in exchange for the products of the country, &s;eems evidently to be right. The wealth which has been accumulated by the Bri|ti&s;h nation, under all the di&s;advantages of a ve|ry profligate, and mo&s;t lavi&s;h government, &s;hews &s;ufficiently the wi&s;dom of their commercial ar|rangements; the two principal of which Mr. Smith admits, have been encouragements to ex|portation, and re&s;traints upon importation. Theories it is to be apprehended, unle&s;s &s;elf evi|dent, or enforced by rea&s;onings of mathemati|cal certainty, ought ever to be rejected in favor of experience. Whatever mi&s;takes Britain may have made about the relative value of &s;pecie, it is evident that her maxims and pur&s;uits have at different times introduced immen&s;e trea&s;ures into her government. That the&s;e trea&s;ures re|main no more, is a di&s;grace which is not to be imputed to her commercial arrangements, but to two other cau&s;es, well worth the ob&s;erva|tion of a younger &s;tate; the one is, the unpa|rallelled profu&s;ion of licentious rulers; the other, that paper &s;y&s;tem of finance, which our mini&s;ters have had the audacity to adopt, which has already &s;apped the ba&s;is of liberty, and will ever poi&s;on the &s;treams of publick opulence:
<PB N="40" REF="031803_0041_0FEE7459C168C378">that &s;y&s;tem of wickedne&s;s and ruin, which no|thing but the u&s;e of &s;pecie can bani&s;h from our land. A rich country, without &s;ecure money, is in the &s;ame condition with a rich merchant, who has no monied capital; and even the pro|perty of the country, however great (as will &s;hortly be proved in England) is no convenient &s;ubject of taxation.</P>
<P>Certain goods however, as tho&s;e of India, though purcha&s;ed with &s;pecie, might, agreeably to the rea&s;onings of Adam Smith, &s;et on foot a trade, which would conduce to the vigor of a government. The goods &s;o purcha&s;ed, being &s;old in a foreign-market, might have brought more than was given for them, and a &s;urplus of ca&s;h might have returned to America. The Briti&s;h mini&s;ter however, perhaps fore&s;eeing this advantage, pur&s;ued the wonted policy of Britain, and poorly &s;tipulated, in article 13, of the treaty, that all goods brought from Briti&s;h ports in India, &s;hould be landed in no place but America, after which there &s;hould be regula|tions adopted by both parties. Now &s;hould it even be agreed upon by Britain, that &s;uch ar|ticles &s;hall be re-&s;hipped, it is evident that the expence would be a great objection: &s;o that the money which goes to India, is likely to remain there by virtue of the treaty.</P>
<P>In B. 4, Chap. 1. Smith a&s;&s;erts that "the quantity of every commodity, which human indu&s;try can either purcha&s;e or produce, natu|rally regulates it&s;elf in every country according to the effectual demand, or according to the de|mand of tho&s;e who are willing to pay the whole
<PB N="41" REF="031803_0042_0FEE745B47953D08">rent, labour, and profit, which mu&s;t be paid, in order to prepare and bring it to market."</P>
<P>Here he &s;eems to overlook this circum&s;tance; that a country may have occa&s;ion for a commo|dity, and yet not po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of effectual demand, and this too, not by rea&s;on of its na|tural want of means "to pay the whole rent, labour, and profit, which mu&s;t be paid in order to prepare and bring it to market," but by rea|&s;on of its re&s;ources being &s;wallowed up by the purcha&s;e of other commodities. Upon the &s;ame principle he &s;eems to be wrong, when he &s;ays (b. 4, chap. 1) "No complaint is more com|mon than that of a &s;carcity of money. Money, like wine, mu&s;t always be &s;carce with tho&s;e who have neither wherewithal to buy, nor credit to borrow it. Tho&s;e who have either, will &s;eldom be in want, either of the money, or of the wine they have occa&s;ion for." This, as well as what went before, he adduces to prove, that no care need be taken to provide a country with &s;pecie. <HI>Money, like wine,</HI> will not only <HI>be &s;carce with tho&s;e who have neither wherewithal to buy, nor credit to borrow it;</HI> but it will al&s;o be &s;carce with tho&s;e who direct the whole of their re&s;our|ces into other channels. In &s;ome of the &s;tates of America, wine, and other articles of impor|tation, are abundant; becau&s;e the produce of the &s;oil is given in exchange for them: if, on the contrary, the produce of the &s;oil were given for money only, wine and other imports mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be as &s;carce as &s;pecie is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Smith &s;ays, moreover, (b. 1, chap. 9, part 3) "Gold and &s;ilver, like other commodities, na|turally &s;eek the market where the be&s;t price is
<PB N="42" REF="031803_0043_0FEE745CCF518A10">given for them, and the be&s;t price is commonly given for every thing in the country which can be&s;t afford it."</P>
<P>But in South-Carolina, before the revolution, a great price was given for &s;pecie: 100 weight of rice for &s;even &s;hillings; yet were not gold and &s;ilver very abundant. To what could this be owing, but the exce&s;s of the imports above the exports, and the productions of the country be|ing paid for, not in &s;pecie, but in the manufac|tures of Europe? A country may indeed grow richer, as has happened to America, though its imports every year exceed its exports. This year it may export &pound;. 500,000, and import &pound;. 550,000; the next year it may export &pound;. 550,000, and import &pound;. 600,000, it has therefore advanced &pound;. 50,000 in its productions, and its capital has become greater in proportion to this advancement. This acce&s;&s;ion of wealth may happen either by the importation of labour|ers, the propagation thereof, or improvements in agriculture and manufactures, &amp;c. at home.

<P>Smith ob&s;erves, that the trade of a nation ought not nece&s;&s;arily to be di&s;couraged, merely becau&s;e the balance is in its favor, it is only to be done in the aggregate. If by this it is meant, that the general average balance, all nations con&s;i|dered, is to be retained in our favor, let it be repeated that Britain almo&s;t monopolizes the trade of America; con&s;equently, care ought to be taken by us, to keep in our own hands the ba|lance of trade again&s;t that particular nation,
<PB N="43" REF="031803_0044_0FEE746398079898">which, as was &s;aid above, holds more of it than perhaps all other nations taken together.</P>
<P>As to the extent to which encouragement &s;hould be given to the importation of &s;pecie; and the pro&s;perity of manufactures (both as the means of excluding tho&s;e from abroad which prevent the influx of &s;pecie in peace, and as the means of rendering us independent of foreigners in time of war) if the principle were admitted, the regulations would follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This chapter &s;hall be clo&s;ed with this remark; that could a paper currency be ever &s;o well &s;e|cured, even in time of war (which is impo&s;&s;ible) this evil will ever attend at in time of peace; the expen&s;ive plans of policy, to which it never fails to lead, accumulate a mountain of publick debt; and this debt paraly&s;es government, and confirms abu&s;es, by the dread which is excited in monied men, the nation's creditors, le&s;t in|novation &s;hould &s;hake the intere&s;ts of the funds. This principle has &s;upported the war again&s;t France; and prevented hitherto a reform in the parliamentary repre&s;entation of Great Britain.</P>

<P>IN the foregoing di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, I have omitted much matter, which I originally intended to bring again&s;t the treaty with Britain. I feared to fatigue the attention with what I believed to be unnece&s;&s;ary, and indi&s;po&s;e it to the con&s;ider|ation of topicks which I believed to be nece&s;&s;ary in the extreme.</P>
<P>There are two main points, however, upon
<PB N="44" REF="031803_0045_0FEE74651ED8F900">which &s;ome of the promoters of the treaty attempt to ground their defence, and I &s;hall remark upon them in few words.</P>
<P>They &s;ay we fir&s;t violated the treaty of peace; and that the Briti&s;h, in the act of taking away American property, during the war, did not violate it. The violations, on our part, were extremely unimportant in their con&s;equences, and were evidently converted into a pretext for embarra&s;&s;ing us in a variety of particulars; a|mong the re&s;t, in the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. It was well known that their predatory conduct upon the &s;eas, was more than a balance for our imputed infractions. The real motive of the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, was the power of involving us in an Indian war; and this power the Briti&s;h employed, as they ever do their mi&s;chiefs, with mo&s;t wicked &s;peed. Yet do the Briti&s;h faction, in America, in con|formity to the re&s;t of their principles, and pro|ceedings, pre&s;ume to advocate the perfidy of carrying off American property. Let us exa|mine the article: "All ho&s;tilities, both by &s;ea and land, &s;hall from henceforth cea&s;e: all pri|&s;oners, on both &s;ides, &s;hall be &s;et at liberty; and his Britannick maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all convenient &s;peed, and without cau&s;ing any de&s;truction, or carrying away any negroes, or other property, of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garri&s;ons and fleets from the &s;aid United States, and from every port, place, or harbour, within the &s;ame." All ho&s;tilities between A|merica and Britain we &s;ee were to cea&s;e; if then, in future, any American property &s;hould be ta|ken, it would be a matter of cour&s;e that it &s;hould
<PB N="45" REF="031803_0046_0FEE7466A64EE668">be delivered up; what need then for any pro|vi&s;ion that it &s;hould be done? and what the purpo&s;e of the &s;tipulation for "cau&s;ing no de|&s;truction, and carrying away no negroes, or other property, of the American inhabitants?" Surely the purpo&s;e was to prevent the removal of what was actually in the hands of the Briti&s;h, and which we are told by Vattel, had become the property of the &s;overeign: What was not in their power could not be carried away, with|out a violation of the agreement, that "all ho|&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;e:" and in conformity to this additional &s;tipulation, with regard to private property, we find a &s;imilar one relative to pub|lick property al&s;o. "It is agreed, that the Briti&s;h &s;hall leave in all fortifications, the artil|lery that may be therein, and moreover they &s;hall cau&s;e, or order, all archives, records, deeds, and papers, belonging to any of the &s;aid &s;tates, or their citizens, which, in the cour&s;e of the war, may have fallen into the hands of the of|ficers, to be forthwith re&s;tored and delivered to the proper &s;tates, and per&s;ons, to whom they belong&mdash;"If then the Briti&s;h violated the treaty, in this in&s;tance, it is evident, that, even &s;uppo&s;ing the interruption of the re|covery of Briti&s;h claims to have been an infrac|tion of the treaty, it was ju&s;tifiable as an act of repri&s;al, and did not warrant the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and other mea&s;ures; attended as they were with advantages to the Briti&s;h &s;o va&s;t and di&s;proportionate, and to us, with pro|portionate lo&s;&s;es in men and money; &s;u&s;tained too in a cruel war with &s;avages, fomented, as is now well known, by the mercile&s;s government of England.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="031803_0047_0FEE74682DBBA058">
Vattel (page 240) &s;ays, "When a ca&s;e ari&s;es in which it would be too prejudicial to any one to take a law, or a promi&s;e, according to the rigour of the terms, a re&s;trictive interpretation is al&s;o then u&s;ed, and we except the ca&s;e agreea|bly to the intention of the legi&s;lature, or of him who made the promi&s;e. For the legi&s;lature only requires what is ju&s;t and equitable, and in the contract no one can engage, in favor of another, in &s;uch a manner as to be e&s;&s;entially wanting to him&s;elf. It is therefore to be pre&s;umed, that neither the legi&s;lature, nor the contracting pow|ers, have intended to extend their regulations to ca&s;es of this nature, and that they, them&s;elves, would have excepted them, had the&s;e ca&s;es pre|&s;ented them&s;elves."</P>
<P>Now, in the two mo&s;t important ca&s;es urged again&s;t us, as infractions of the treaty, namely the laws of Virginia and South-Carolina, to pre|vent the recovery of Briti&s;h claims, the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences mu&s;t have en&s;ued upon the operation of &s;uch &s;uits. It is a matter of noto|riety, that when the re&s;traints upon the courts of law were removed, the Briti&s;h creditors, while they &s;pared the e&s;tates of their own fac|tion, tore to pieces, without he&s;itation, or re|mor&s;e, all tho&s;e which belonged to the friends of America: and the bu&s;ine&s;s of i&s;&s;uing writs, brought into lucrative practice, the mo&s;t ob|&s;cure in the profe&s;&s;ion of the law: and, for want of purcha&s;ers, &s;o cheaply would property have &s;old, at the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing of the in&s;talment law in South-Carolina, that, even the Briti&s;h creditors them&s;elves would have &s;uffered exceedingly, had they immediately enforced their claims.
<PB N="47" REF="031803_0048_0FEE746C28E7C188">But who can hear with patience the defence of Briti&s;h infractions, in con&s;equence of trifles im|puted to our&s;elves, which affected but a &s;mall proportion of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, when the whole body of American &s;eamen, in violation of eve|ry principle of morals and humanity, in con|tempt of the rights, and honour of America, had perpetually been &s;eized like bea&s;ts, and after|wards made to fight again&s;t friends, or brethren. When too no compen&s;ation, or future &s;ecurity, was in&s;i&s;ted on by the American negociators. We are told by Camillus, that American &s;eamen &s;poke the language of Engli&s;hmen, and there|fore could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;uch. Does Camillus believe, the Briti&s;h government would &s;ubmit to a plea thus ruinous to their trade, and naval &s;trength, and degrading to their honour, were we to attempt to pre&s;s their &s;eamen?</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, moreover, that mo&s;t of the infractions complained of, took place from the disjointed, unorganized &s;tate of the old fe|deral government. Let any candid, &s;en&s;ible man, judge, whether any power ought to be treated with in a &s;econd in&s;tance, which, in the fir&s;t, acting as in deri&s;ion of all maxims of ho|nour, and the laws of nations, had taken advan|tage of over-&s;ights, and unavoidable circum&s;tan|ces. Thus, becau&s;e, in a pacifick di&s;po&s;ition, we had &s;tipulated more than we found our&s;elves able to perform, and becau&s;e we did not ulti|mately perform what was not in the power of the general government, this friendly &s;tate of Britain is ju&s;tified in all its acts of infidelity, de|liberate treachery, oppre&s;&s;ion, and robbery: all of which were trebly advantageous to it&s;elf, as
<PB N="48" REF="031803_0049_0FEE7470256FB998">they were moreover eminently pernicious to our|&s;elves, and to that people who fir&s;t enabled us to take our rank among the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>This then is the ally with which we have connected our&s;elves, to the great di&s;gu&s;t of long known, faithful friends. In our tran&s;actions with the Briti&s;h, I have ob&s;erved above, that we have repeatedly felt the advantage of acts of alienati|on from the Engli&s;h government, and never &s;urely was there a time when &s;uch acts more powerfully pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves upon our adoption. Never, too, were we in a condition which &s;o fully could e&s;tabli&s;h the prudence of &s;uch mea|&s;ures. America, in her former attempts to rid her&s;elf of Briti&s;h influence, was in the &s;ituation of a man who &s;trives to ama&s;s wealth without a capital to work with. The &s;ucce&s;s, in both in|&s;tances, mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of great internal re|&s;ources. The natural and political advantages of America, however, have increa&s;ed exceed|ingly &s;ince the declaration of independence. Her wealth is perhaps doubled, and her popula|tion more than doubled. Who &s;hall tell the force, collected into ma&s;s, which the combining republicks of America, France, and Holland, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to combine, &s;hall hurl again&s;t the drooping head of Britain? Who &s;hall calculate the exploits of three republicks, each of which has triumphed in its turn in the cau&s;e of freedom, and one of which has brought to utter ruin the noble&s;t armies of Europe, and overrun the continent? Will any man &s;et bounds to the potency of three free nations of armies, linked together for the purpo&s;e of breaking the bending pride of Britain? With what unequal|led
<PB N="49" REF="031803_0050_0FEE7471AC04C898">might will this triple giant da&s;h vengeance upon a &s;inking foe? Where &s;hall Britain, with an exhau&s;ted trea&s;ury, ruined, divided councils, and empoveri&s;hed rebellious &s;ubjects, find means, once more, to hurl around the thunders of the deep? Who &s;hall calculate the re&s;ources and achievements of population, &s;oil, and climate, &s;o various and &s;o va&s;t, all acting in concert for the greate&s;t of purpo&s;es, under the immediate guid|ance, and the animating &s;houts of enthu&s;ia&s;tick liberty? All the proud advantages of commerce, wealth, naval power, and conque&s;t, which &s;o long marked Britain as the champion of the uni|ver&s;e, whence came they, but from the liberal hand of freedom? Shall America, who in her infancy &s;hrunk not from the uplifted arm of Bri|tain in her fulle&s;t might, now decline the con|te&s;t in her puberty; and dare not, with power|ful a&s;&s;ociates in the fight, to brave a feeble, aged, warrior, and &s;end with ignominy, and &s;orrow, to the grave, tho&s;e hairs which have grown grey in wickedne&s;s and &s;trife? What is the very pur|po&s;e of this Briti&s;h treaty? Is it not to break the energy of a republick, which the decaying &s;trength of Britain dreads? So, when Charles IId of England was a helple&s;s wanderer, the monarchy of France re&s;tored him to his throne, to cripple the growing might of the republick which they feared. What are the mi&s;creant principles which bind us to this fallen bully, Bri|tain? Fear and di&s;affection. But let the cool, deliberate republican remember, that Britain cannot hurt him now; and that &s;he will never do him good. The experience which we our|&s;elves, and the French nation, have had of the
<PB N="50" REF="031803_0051_0FEE74746F79DAB8">Briti&s;h government, both hated for our love of liberty, warrant the conclu&s;ion, that, upon all occa&s;ions which &s;hall pre&s;ent them&s;elves, it will not fail to con&s;ult its intere&s;ts, indulging to the utmo&s;t its lu&s;t of domination. England is not &s;imply unfriendly to us in a negative &s;en&s;e; it is po&s;itively and warmly inimical, as a haughty fa&s;ti|dious de&s;poti&s;m: and France was, before the treaty, and may be made again, po&s;itively and warmly our unfeigned friend. The Briti&s;h have often &s;hed our blood; the French have often &s;hed their own in our defence. We have tried too long the friend&s;hip of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, but let us now, at length, once more con|vince this proud intruder, that it has deemed fal&s;ely of that &s;pirit it once knew to dread, and that, like a little wanton boy, it has ra&s;hly wa|ked a &s;leeping lion.</P>

<P>BUT let us endeavour to improve our judg|ment upon the que&s;tion, whether the con|nexion which has been formed between America and Britain, by the treaty, is likely to be at|tended with advantage to the republick. One mean of effecting our purpo&s;e, will be by exa|mining into the characters of tho&s;e men in pow|er, who, during the late admini&s;tration, &s;uc|ceeded by unexampled pertinacity in every art of flattery and arrogance, meanne&s;s and impu|dence, in procuring the execution of this treaty of amity and commerce.</P>
<P>Before the contrivers of this odious deed con|&s;ented
<PB N="51" REF="031803_0052_0FEE7479DB9537E0">to forget their mutual &s;entiments of ha|tred or contempt, before the&s;e per&s;onal enemies combined, as political friends, in one general hell|born league, again&s;t the people; before the&s;e atrocious parricides had held their daggers to the brea&s;t of liberty, bidding her wear their chains, ru&s;hing upon our &s;phere, like a comet, which brings di&s;may, and threatens ruin to the nations, her temple &s;eemed to &s;tand upon a rock of ada|mant, firm, inacce&s;&s;ible, and &s;ublime. They be|guiled the thoughtle&s;s multitude, by babbling idle tales about the needful energy of govern|ment; And in what at length have their perni|cious errors and de&s;igns terminated? In what but the energy of ru&s;hing into the gulph of mi|&s;ery and infamy? in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to long, repeated, unprovoked injuries of the pa&s;t, and a free con|&s;ent, on our part, in our treaty of redre&s;s, to &s;ubmit to more, or greater, which may be of|fered in future? After triumphing over the arms of Britain, the&s;e &s;orry &s;tate&s;men have degraded us like a conquered country. America is the Carthage of the pre&s;ent hour, which has lately pa&s;&s;ed beneath the yoke of Britain. To bring about the&s;e flagitious purpo&s;es, the&s;e daring ruf|fians have not he&s;itated to &s;hake to the very ba&s;is the fabrick of the federal union; while they accu&s;ed the republicans of di&s;organizing the government, they encouraged a mob to defy the immediate repre&s;entatives of the general ma&s;s of the people in the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, by whom, amid&s;t menaces and every &s;pecies of outrage, the treaty was finally and reluctantly carried into execution. The gigantick form of America was found in &s;lumber by the admini&s;tra|tion,
<PB N="52" REF="031803_0053_0FEE747B6395C978">and they, with their <HI>little</HI> hands, have bound her, like Prometheus, with indi&s;&s;oluble chains, that vultures may feed upon her tortured vitals, till time &s;hall be no more. Now can any man who reflects upon the labours of the revolution, more e&s;pecially if he can &s;ay <HI>Quorum pars minima fui;</HI> can &s;uch a man, without a &s;toick's apathy, forbear to rage at the view of &s;chemes, which avarice or ambition, or the pernicious pride of &s;elfi&s;h ari&s;tocracy has devi&s;ed to make &s;uch la|bours fruitle&s;s?</P>
<P>After all, bad as this treaty mu&s;t be admitted to be, can we but &s;ucceed in ridding our&s;elves of &s;o great a bane, this eventual good will at la&s;t have attended its adoption; it has had an in|fluence in pointing the eyes of the people, with &s;ome degree of attention, to the mea&s;ures of their rulers. We &s;hould know therefore, under that circum&s;tance, that wa&s;ps having u&s;ed their &s;tings have parted with them, that tho&s;e &s;erpents which have injected their poi&s;on can de&s;troy no more. Yet, after &s;ins, which the tongues of angels cannot tell; after crimes, which the fiends who prompted cannot recount, the&s;e men, who in their cells of midnight darkne&s;s, have undone their country, have the matchle&s;s effrontery to come forth in the glare of day, and to avow their guilt. The face of con&s;ummate profligacy, formed of no penetrable &s;tuff, has given to the&s;e men the &s;acred privilege of innocence, <HI>nulla palle&s;cere culpa.</HI> Since then, this abandoned crew are &s;o little a&s;hamed of ignominy, let us proceed to look into tho&s;e previous &s;teps by which they &s;trove to alienate the minds of the citizens from tho&s;e principles which might fru&s;trate the
<PB N="53" REF="031803_0054_0FEE747CE919BE68">execution of their de&s;igns upon the freedom, and upon the very exi&s;tence of the republick.</P>
<P>One of the earlie&s;t artifices, by which it was attempted to &s;trip the nation of its rights, was, an attack upon the liberty of &s;peech, and of the pre&s;s. The men who were a&s;&s;ociated for the purpo&s;e of watching over the movements of our rulers, and expre&s;&s;ing their opinions to the pub|lick, were indu&s;triou&s;ly repre&s;ented as the very pe&s;ts of the community. The printers of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon public mea&s;ures, were treated with &s;corn and abhorrence; and a halter, en|clo&s;ed in a box, has been &s;ent to one of them, to intimidate the whole fraternity. In future, it is to be hoped, that both writers and printers, by the freedom of their animadver&s;ions, will &s;hew the decadence of all &s;uch pernicious influ|ence, and that they will unite in an active u&s;e of a privilege, which it has been attempted to wre&s;t from their hands; a privilege, which while it remains, will be the palladium of the re&s;t, and gives us good hope, that the &s;poilers, who &s;trove to gra&s;p it, may be forced, in their own de&s;pight, to quit in di&s;may tho&s;e po&s;ts they have held &s;o long in infamy. But for the pre|&s;ervation of the freedom of the pre&s;s, we might again have been told, we mu&s;t not
<Q>"Prate of &s;tate affairs;"</Q> But let us in our turn, acquaint the&s;e puny lord|lings, that the rulers of a republican nation, can obtain the obedience of the citizens, by no means &s;o certain as the exerci&s;e of republican maxims; without which they de&s;erve not to be obeyed; let us tell them that the mo&s;t artful, &s;el|fi&s;h demagogue, will ever find it hard to &s;hake
<PB N="54" REF="031803_0055_0FEE747E6FAED538">an admini&s;tration, in a repre&s;entative republick, &s;o long as it performs its duties.

Let not the violators of the publick rights expect forever to e&s;cape impunity, notwith&s;tanding the lenity they have unde&s;ervedly experienced, during the late admini&s;tration. And what was the return the people found for their moderation to the promoters of the &s;hameful and illegal treaty? Was not every man, who di&s;liked this treaty, nay, were not the &s;ages and heroes of the revolu|tion, who&s;e hoary hairs were twined with ivy, or with laurel; were not this veteran band of patriots branded with every mark of contume|ly and di&s;grace, by the mo&s;t nefarious faction that ever in&s;ulted the &s;acred ears of virtue&mdash;a faction which are now &s;triving to bring the&s;e vene|rable &s;eniors into their de&s;igns again&s;t the French: But &s;hall the&s;e faithful &s;ervants of our country's cau&s;e, forget that they were &s;tigmatized as de|ceivers, antifederali&s;ts, jacobins and di&s;organi|zers? Deceivers they were called, becau&s;e they &s;trove to undeceive; antifederali&s;ts, becau&s;e they &s;trove to pre&s;erve the con&s;titution and ble&s;|&s;ings of the federal government; jacobins, be|cau&s;e they wi&s;hed to avert the mi&s;eries of civil war, and mutual &s;laughter, which even now this treaty threatens, nay has already commen|ced in a brother's blood; di&s;organizers, becau&s;e they wi&s;hed to keep in &s;ound condition the or|gans of the nation's liberty.

Oh, call to your remembrance tho&s;e who freed you from that dependence on a de&s;pot, which this treaty would renew! They were &s;imple, &s;en&s;ible, incorruptible men: men, who if they were poor, &s;till continued poor, that they might not be wicked: men, who were the firm, and I hope, in general immutable friends to that nation, which with ingratitude, commen&s;urate with congenial ba&s;ene&s;s, the treaty invited us to abandon: to abandon too for <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> which happily they felt not. Who &s;hall confide in &s;uch foul flagitious coun&s;ellors? Who &s;hall again ad|mini&s;ter to our aid, under circum&s;tances of &s;uch complicated guilt and folly?

<P>Among the topicks of calumny employed by the admini&s;tration, it has been a&s;&s;erted, that their enemies have wi&s;hed them removed from &s;elfi&s;h or ambitious views, and that the treaty was made the pretext. Selfi&s;h and ambitious men there doubtle&s;s will be found in every oppo&s;ition: the rea&s;oning of the&s;e however de&s;erve to be heard, and if, upon a &s;crutiny, the argument be acknowledged to be good, and the character worthle&s;s, accept the advice, and let the advi|&s;er be rejected; for it mu&s;t be admitted by all parties, that a bad man will make a wor&s;e officer. As to the admini&s;tration, and the promoters of the treaty, every man who loves the principles of republican government, which, as far as in them lies they have de&s;troyed, cannot choo&s;e but wi&s;h them out.

<P>It is &s;aid too, that the republicans are unfriendly to the treaty, becau&s;e enemies to the Briti&s;h. If by the Briti&s;h is meant the Briti&s;h nation, the charge is fal&s;e; were Britons republicans we could freely make them brethren; but in being enemies to the Briti&s;h government, we are ene|mies to perfidy, which regards no treaties; to ambition, which gra&s;ps at the dominion of our country; to tyranny, which delights in cruelty.
<PB N="57" REF="031803_0058_0FEE748814B8DAF8">Could we, with any prudence, put confidence in a &s;tate, which at the very moment it was fra|ming a treaty of amity with one free people, was engaged in the abominable attempt to deprive another of its freedom, or its being?</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the arrogance, meanne&s;s, duplicity, and ba&s;ene&s;s of our rulers &s;hould have been &s;uch as we have found them, ought not to be a &s;ubject of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;ince the&s;e men have not &s;cru|pled, &s;ome to profe&s;s, others to prove, them&s;elves votaries to monarchy, which bears the&s;e igno|minous &s;ymbols on its front. Nor need we mar|vel, that tho&s;e who vilely truckle to a prince's nod, &s;hould &s;eek their gracele&s;s retribution in the peo|ple's wrongs. A patient &s;lave proves an unfeel|ing tyrant; &s;o pride and meanne&s;s &s;trut or creep by turns, and mark the Proteus form or &s;elfi&s;h de&s;poti&s;m. Such men as were employed in the fabrication of the Briti&s;h treaty were, if not morally, at lea&s;t politically, di&s;qualified for the ta&s;k of forming an alliance for the pro&s;perity of a republick. Nor is it to be wondered at, that &s;uch men have toiled, with wa&s;teful hands, to bring to wreck all principles of freedom, which had but ye&s;terday been launched upon the &s;ea of politicks. In the unhallowed &s;trife no means were left untried; neither the guile of Satan, the fallacies of Belial, nor the rage of Moloch. This treaty, which holds up an olive branch to our eyes, veils a &s;courge of &s;corpions for our backs, and, like a wily Dalilah, will yield us,
<PB N="58" REF="031803_0059_0FEE748ADFB4BAD0">&s;unk in &s;oft langours, &s;horn of &s;trength, into the un&s;paring hands of Britain. Oh let us not for|get the ble&s;&s;ings we po&s;&s;e&s;s, but gra&s;p them now, as with the convul&s;ive pangs of dying liberty! The American government, as it lingers now, is founded upon a full, and free, and equal re|pre&s;entation, in every branch of legi&s;lation, of the whole body of the people which gave it be|ing; the fir&s;t government, of this &s;pecies, which the world could boa&s;t, and the only &s;pecies of free government which gives, or could give, a credible pro&s;pect of duration. Too long did monarchies affright the &s;huddering world with deeds of horror, in ever-during conflicts for the powers of mi&s;chief. Never will mankind be freed from wo and &s;laughter, till republicks &s;hall bear down the &s;cale of power, and keep all con|querors in awe. Then, and not till then, &s;hall we &s;ee the Saturnian reign of order, peace, and ju&s;tice. Nor does the warlike character of France invalidate this doctrine at all. France fights in her defence, and does but drive back into the countries of her enemies tho&s;e wars which would con&s;ume her own. But when the work of liberty &s;hall be complete, free republicans will direct their eyes to more inviting &s;cenes, nor will appoint &s;uch rulers as will with|draw them from repo&s;e. In monarchies, on the contrary, the &s;ubject is con&s;trained to con|tent him&s;elf, as he can, with the wretch who rules, whether a coward, who de&s;erts him in the day of peril, or a conqueror, who impels him to the field of blood. Let us render our|&s;elves dear to tho&s;e nations which have &s;triven with us the fight of freedom; let us love, and we
<PB N="59" REF="031803_0060_0FEE7490537619F8">&s;hall be loved again by that a&s;toni&s;hing nation, who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;m is upheld by their magnanimity, who&s;e magnanimity by their vigour, who&s;e vi|gour hurls them like thunderbolts upon their foes. This is the character of the French re|publick; while feeble Britain, like a broken reed, &s;hall &s;ink beneath your weight, or pierce your &s;ide. Her weakne&s;s only can re&s;tore her innocence; a frozen &s;erpent, or a toothle&s;s &s;avage.</P>
<P>What difficulties may be thrown in the way of conciliation with France, by the treaty ma|kers of the &s;enate, it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee: but let tho&s;e apo&s;tates to the faith of freedom remember the fate of delinquents in the revo|lution congre&s;s. Let &s;uch recreants to good be warned by the fall of Bolinbroke, or &s;trive too late, in vain, to cool the fever of ambition, with the unpalatable cup of cold philo&s;ophy,</P>
<P>Even the&s;e men, if they love them&s;elves&mdash; if they wi&s;h to be remembered without execra|tion, when grey hairs &s;hall give them warning to quit the &s;tage of public life&mdash;if they wi&s;h to e&s;cape that bed of thorns, which goads the faithle&s;s ruler, &s;hould u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to redeem their country.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e members of the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives, from whom the pre&s;&s;ure of the time extorted reluctant co-operation, let them feel no repugnance again&s;t the mea&s;ure of countervail|ing mi&s;chief; more e&s;pecially mi&s;chief which them&s;elves have done. The publick confidence mu&s;t be re&s;umed by confe&s;&s;ion and renunciation, not by pertinacity in error.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ident of the United States, he has held up a beacon, by which each mariner,
<PB N="60" REF="031803_0061_0FEE30B461F2FE88">in our turbulent &s;ea, may &s;teer his cour&s;e. He came into office at a cri&s;is, and in a &s;ituation. more than any to be coveted. He found an or|der of things, and a body of courtiers, the very wor&s;t a free repre&s;entative government could ever dread to know. This order of things, and this body of courtiers, he has re&s;olved to fix. His country looked up to him for wi&s;dom, for candour, for deci&s;ion, for &s;alvation, and what would have been the glory of that man, who &s;hould have redeemed his country a &s;econd time from &s;lavery and perdition.</P>
<P>How widely this giddy ruler has wandered from the path of rectitude, how madly he is in ho&s;tility with the principles of the republick which has employed him, we &s;ee with &s;orrow; but we &s;ee it not with wonder, &s;ince he is the work of Briti&s;h hands. All that has been left undone, by others, to effect our ruin, he has &s;triven to complete. Of the country, over which, in an evil hour, he was called to pre&s;ide, he &s;peaks with exultation for her pro&s;perity, when &s;ome angel's hand &s;hould be employed to &s;natch her from de&s;pair. He &s;peaks of peace, and while his breath is &s;till warm with the word, it is employed again to &s;ound the charge to bat|tle. Can we admit the &s;incerity of &s;uch a ma|gi&s;trate? If we acquit his heart we mu&s;t de&s;|pi&s;e his head; if we acquit his head we mu&s;t abominate his heart. As to his wretched ga&s;|conade, upon the &s;ubject of American arms (to &s;ay nothing of the &s;ilence which his party ob&s;erved upon the in&s;olence of Britain) let me add to what has gone before, that the pea&s;ants of the northern &s;tates, who alone can be de|pended
<PB N="61" REF="031803_0062_0FEE74949EE2E410">upon for their &s;trength, would &s;oon be deprived, by their allies the Briti&s;h, of all &s;elf re&s;pect, and even that independence which mu&s;t give efficiency to &s;trength; and for the marine of America, a naval war would be a mine of gold to the French nation, while we &s;hould not reap the advantages even of a mine of lead. The means by which alone we can hope to gra&s;p our object, is by holding up the greate&s;t good to friendly nations; the treaty, on the contrary, has rewarded aggre&s;&s;ion; and not only the French, but the Dutch al&s;o, and perhaps every other nation, make the &s;ame complaint. The mini&s;ter at the Hague, indeed, tells you, the Dutch complain, becau&s;e they are in&s;tructed &s;o to do by France; but needs a man a prompter to di&s;cern his enemy? Had the French in&s;ulted us as gro&s;&s;ly as has been declared, and found their policy in the policy of Britain, what, who, let me a&s;k, fir&s;t &s;purned into the du&s;t this pride of ours, placing it under the feet of every wanton pa&s;&s;enger to cru&s;h it down at plea&s;ure? What but the treaty with Britain? Who, but the Bri|ti&s;h faction in America? Yet does your pre&s;ident tell you we are not to throw our&s;elves into ei|ther &s;cale of European politicks. Has not the treaty done this now? Would not mr. Pitt &s;mile with triumph, to hear the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the United States boa&s;t of &s;uch a neutrality? A neutrality, which if not an armed, is at lea&s;t a ho&s;tile neutrality. When the obnoxious articles of the treaty &s;hall have been done away, when the articles which are at defiance, not only with France, but every power on earth, are done away, then, then indeed, will there be a neutrality in
<PB N="62" REF="031803_0063_0FEE749759977F98">fact and not in words, not in thin air, not in any nothing. Far different will be the opera|tions of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, from that of mea&s;ures formed by men, who while they &s;teered the bark of &s;tate, were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;kill to fore&s;ee a &s;torm of &s;laughter, or a &s;hower of blood; or watched like cloud-veiled fiends but to betray; and tempted to de&s;troy!</P>
<P>Hear further what you are told by this new|born monarch of a republick; and from his rant &s;hould the character of America be too ra&s;hly e&s;timated, &s;he would be judged an infant of un|timely &s;tature, which, in its mental weakne&s;s, believed it&s;elf a man.</P>
<P>In remarking upon the &s;peech of the pre&s;ident of the directory to mr. Munroe, upon his de|parture, he &s;ays, "the &s;peech of the pre&s;ident di&s;clo&s;es &s;entiments more alarming than the re|fu&s;al of a mini&s;ter, becau&s;e more dangerous to our independence and union; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;tudiou&s;ly marked with indignities towards the government of the United States. It evin|ces a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate the people from the government: to per&s;uade them that they have different affections, principles, and intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of their fellow citizens, whom they, them|&s;elves, have cho&s;en to manage their common con|cerns; and thus to produce divi&s;ions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a deci&s;ion which &s;hall convince France and the world, that we are not a divided people; hu|miliated under a colonial &s;pirit of fear, and &s;en&s;e of inferiority, fitted to be the mi&s;erable in&s;tru|ments of foreign influence, and regardle&s;s of na|tional honor, character, and intere&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="031803_0064_0FEE749A15A57D18">
This &s;peech of the pre&s;ident of the directory, it &s;eems, was delivered in the warmth of his at|tachment to Mr. Munroe, as a <HI>republican.</HI> Whe|ther it would have excited &s;o much indignation in the feeling bo&s;om of Mr. Adams, had it been delivered by the &s;ecretary of an European mo|narch, to an ari&s;tocratick mini&s;ter, expre&s;&s;ing &s;imilar di&s;approbation of a republican admini&s;|tration in America, I &s;hall leave to the deci&s;ion even of the ari&s;tocracy it&s;elf. But, &s;o far as the &s;peech has a tendency to per&s;uade the people that "their rulers have different affections, prin|ciples, and intere&s;ts, from tho&s;e of their fellow|citizens, whom they, them&s;elves, have cho&s;en to manage their common concerns;" &s;o far as this doctrine goes, no republican of common infor|mation, whether in America or France, will find it po&s;&s;ible to conceive even the embryo of a doubt: and no man who was not con&s;cious of the truth of this di&s;tinction of <HI>affections, prin|ciples,</HI> and <HI>intere&s;ts,</HI> would &s;o warmly re&s;ent the explanation. Mr. Adams could not but know, or he knows not enough to qualify him for a much inferior office to that which he has been called upon to di&s;grace, that the pur&s;uits of the governors, as di&s;criminated from tho&s;e of the governed, have, in all &s;tates, been the primal &s;ource of tyranny in the fir&s;t, and va&s;&s;aliage in the la&s;t. An endeavour, therefore, on the part of the pre&s;ident of the United States, to clo&s;e the eyes of the unwary multitude upon their concerns, and to per&s;uade them to re&s;ign, with &s;otti&s;h apathy, and infatuation, their deare&s;t rights and intere&s;ts, into the unre&s;pon&s;ible hands of any &s;et of rulers, much more into the hands of
<PB N="64" REF="031803_0065_0FEE749CDC957970">avowed enemies to republican government, is an act of trea&s;on again&s;t the maje&s;ty of the American people. How far the French were wrong in declaring their belief of an exi&s;ting difference between the &s;entiments of the people, and the rulers of America, we will not determine, but &s;imply remark, that if it did not exi&s;t, the promulgation of the opinion of the directory was not likely to originate this difference; and this we will add, (and who &s;hall deny it?) that it was very fortunate the directory &s;o long had <HI>one</HI> opinion of an admini&s;tration which &s;o little de&s;erved a good one, and <HI>another</HI> of a people which it was &s;o much our intere&s;t they &s;hould love. For the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, if they are wi&s;e, they will not delay to &s;hew, not only to the French, but to all the world be&s;ide, that they de&s;erve not to be &s;tamped with any marks which &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h them from their fellow|citizen; but that they are as good, and attends as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the intere&s;ts of the republick as the nation it&s;elf, which they have the high honor to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Much &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the de&s;ire indicated by the French to cripple the commerce of Great Britain; and upon their attempt to get Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els excluded from the ports of Denmark, Hamburgh, and I know not what. It is inti|mated that they are ambitious, and are de&s;irous to build their greatne&s;s upon the ruin of Britain. That any nation &s;hould &s;trive to build their greatne&s;s upon that foundation which alone can bear it, is &s;urely no cu&s;tomary &s;ubject of com|plaint, in tho&s;e in&s;tances wherein it is not pre|tended
<PB N="65" REF="031803_0066_0FEE749E640396D8">that any &s;cruples have been ob&s;ervable in the proceedings of the party which is to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Denmark, Hamburgh, America, and every maritime nation upon the globe, no doubt, are ambitious to obtain a portion of tho&s;e commer|cial advantages, which have &s;o long rendered Britain the tyrant of the &s;eas. While tyrants pro&s;per, &s;ubjects mu&s;t remain in poverty. Let them peri&s;h all, whether upon the water, or up|on the land! The &s;truggle is not between A|merica and France; it is between kings and freemen. Our die will &s;oon be thrown, and it is an awful ca&s;t.</P>
