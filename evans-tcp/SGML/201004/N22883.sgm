<P>The next Cen&s;or will contain a letter to the infamous Tom Paine, in an&s;wer to the brutal attack, which the de&s;pots of France have certainly paid him for making on General Wa&s;hington, and on the government and Con|&s;titution of the United States.&mdash;This Cen&s;or will al&s;o begin remarks on the debates in Congre&s;s.</P>

<P>As nothing is more gratifying than the <HI>applau&s;e,</HI> or profitable than the <HI>admonition,</HI> of good men, I have rea|&s;on to congratulate my&s;elf on an abundance of both: but as applau&s;e ought never to be purcha&s;ed with money, and as admonition is a commodity that every one is ready to be&s;tow gratis, I mu&s;t reque&s;t that future communi|cations of this kind may come to me <HI>po&s;t-free.</HI>&mdash;I al&s;o beg leave to hint to tho&s;e who give me advice, which they wi&s;h I &s;hould follow, not to do it in too dictatorial a &s;tyle; for, if I have any good qualities, docility, I am afraid, is not to be numbered among&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>THE POLITICAL CENSOR, <HI>For NOVEMBER</HI> 1796.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>REMARKS</HI> ON CITIZEN ADET's NOTES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE moment the Gallic u&s;urpers had mur|dered their &s;overeign, and, from the vile&s;t walks in life, mounted into his &s;eat, they a&s;&s;um|ed the tone of ma&s;ters to the government of the United States. Their &s;tyle has &s;ometimes &s;often|ed, it is true; but the general tenor of it has re|gularly approached towards that loftie&s;t note, that <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of in&s;olence, which it attained in <HI>Citizen Adet's</HI> la&s;t communications.</P>
<P>In offering my &s;entiments on the&s;e arrogant effu&s;ions of up&s;tart tyranny, I feel an unu&s;ual de|gree
<PB N="6" REF="030226_0004_0FE54ADBD29EA1D0">
of diffidence: a diffidence that does not ari&s;e from any fear I entertain of the Citizen or his factious adherents, or even of the "terrible nation," to u&s;e his own words, of which he was lately the worthy repre&s;entative; but from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my inability to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject. The keene&s;t &s;atire, were I ma&s;ter of it, would fall blunted from &s;uch hardened impu|dence, &s;uch pure unadulterated bra&s;s, as it would here have to encounter. Terms of reproach are not yet invented, capable of expre&s;&s;ing the re|&s;entment that every man, who has the lea&s;t re&s;pect for the government, ought to feel on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus voluntarily to interfere in a corre&s;pond|ence between a foreign mini&s;ter and the officers of &s;tate, might, under other circum&s;tances, ap|pear rather a bold intru&s;ion; but, the Citizen's having communicated his papers <HI>to the people,</HI> at the &s;ame time, if not before, they reached the Secretary of State, happily precludes the nece&s;|&s;ity of an apology.</P>
<P>The notes on which I am about to remark, and to which, collected together, I have affixed the title of <HI>Diplomatic Blunderbu&s;s,</HI> are intended chief|ly to notify to the people of America, that the French rulers are angry with the Federal Go|vernment, and that, in con&s;equence of this an|ger, they have ordered Citizen Adet to &s;u&s;pend his functions as mini&s;ter, till the government &s;hall alter its conduct, or, in the pedagogue &s;tyle, mend its manners.</P>
<P>In the 44th page of the <HI>Blunderbu&s;s,</HI> the Citi|zen makes a recapitulation of the offences that
<PB N="7" REF="030226_0005_0FE54ADD6FC53B98">
have brought on us this dreadful cha&s;ti&s;ement, this political excommunication; and it will not appear a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;ome of them have exi&s;ted ever &s;ince the birth of the French Repub|lic, notwith&s;tanding the love and e&s;teem this out|landi&s;h lady has ever expre&s;&s;ed towards her &s;i&s;ter America.</P>
<P>The&s;e offences amounting to &s;even in number, are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Federal Government <HI>put in que&s;tion,</HI> whether it &s;hould execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the <HI>rebel</HI> and pro&s;crib|ed <HI>princes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It made a proclamation of <HI>in&s;idious</HI> neu|trality.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By its <HI>chicaneries,</HI> it <HI>abandoned</HI> French pri|vateers to its courts of ju&s;tice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It eluded the amicable mediation of the French Republic for breaking the chains of the American citizens in Algiers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It <HI>allowed</HI> the French colonies to be declar|ed in a &s;tate of blockade, and <HI>allowed</HI> the citizens of America to be interdicted the right of trading to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. It eluded all the advances made by the French Republic for renewing the <HI>treaties of commerce</HI> upon a more favourable footing to both nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. It anticipated Great Britain, by &s;olicit|ing a treaty, in which treaty it pro&s;tituted
<PB N="8" REF="030226_0006_0FE54ADF05EB0F78">
its neutrality; it &s;acrificed France to her enemies, or rather, looking upon her as obliterated from the chart [map] of the world, it forgot the &s;ervices &s;he had render|ed it, and threw a&s;ide the duty of gratitude, as if ingratitude was a governmental duty.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are the heinous crimes of which the Fe|deral Government &s;tands charged by the &s;ultans of France. Let us now, if they will permit us, examine the&s;e crimes, one by one, and &s;ee whe|ther the Pre&s;ident, and Me&s;&s;rs. Hamilton, Knox, Jay, Pickering and Wolcot, really de&s;erve to be guillotined, or not.</P>
<P N="1"><Q><HI>1.</HI> The Federal Government put in que&s;tion, whether it &s;hould execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the <HI>rebel</HI> and pro&s;cribed princes.</Q></P>
<P>The Citizen has made a &s;mall mi&s;take in draw|ing up this charge, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to his ig|norance of that excellent rule of the Engli&s;h language, which requires every thing to be called by its right name. I would have worded it thus: <Q>The Federal Government put in que&s;tion, whe|ther it &s;hould execute the treaties, made between America and the king of France, with his <HI>re|bel &s;ubjects</HI> who had ju&s;t murdered him, or re|ceive the agents of his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the Princes whom tho&s;e murderers had had the au|dacity to pretend to pro&s;cribe.</Q></P>
<P>With this trifling alteration, I am ready to ad|mit the truth of the charge, but am very far from admitting it to be a crime. The king of France was murdered on the 21&s;t of January, 1793. In|formation
<PB N="9" REF="030226_0007_0FE54AE11AC91610">
of this event could not be received here much before the 18th of April, and it was on that day the Pre&s;ident &s;ubmitted to his coun|cil, the que&s;tions of which the above charge forms the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The treaties here &s;poken of, were made with Louis XVI. who&s;e mini&s;ter, at the time the&s;e que&s;tions were propo&s;ed for con&s;ideration, was re&s;ident at Philadelphia. The Pre&s;ident knew, indeed, that the king was dead, but he, at the &s;ame time, knew that the treaties were binding on the United States in behalf of his lawful <Q>heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</Q> and he certainly knew that Petion, Danton, Roland, Clavi&egrave;re, Condorcet, Bri&s;&s;ot, and the innumerable horde of bloody u&s;urpers who have come after them, were not tho&s;e <Q>heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors?</Q> He al&s;o knew, that even the whole French nation, could not, in the &s;en&s;e of the treaties, become the "heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors" of Louis XVI. and, though treaties, made with a monarch, <HI>may</HI> remain in force with the nation under a new form of government, yet this is, as mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it ought to be, entirely at the op|tion of the other contracting party. The Ameri|can government had, therefore, an indi&s;puted right to refu&s;e to execute, in behalf of the French nation, treaties made with their &s;overeign alone.</P>
<P>If we turn back a little, we &s;hall find this very audacious and unprincipled Convention, who&s;e mini&s;ter was coming to Philadelphia, publicly de|liberating, <Q>whether the treaties, made with the <HI>tyrant Louis,</HI> were binding on the <HI>regenerated nation,</HI> or not.</Q> This que&s;tion was determined <HI>in the negative,</HI> and accordingly the treaty with
<PB N="10" REF="030226_0008_0FE54AE4EE324758">
Holland was immediately violated. And yet they will not permit the poor government of America to debate about any &s;uch thing, nor even to talk of it in &s;ecret, though the re&s;ult be in their own favour! Let it be remembered too, that Genet came authorized to make <HI>new treaties,</HI> a pretty certain proof, that the Convention did not call in que&s;tion the right of the government to refu&s;e to adhere to the old ones. It is a proof of more; it is a proof that they expected that it would make the refu&s;al. Would to God their expectation had been realized!</P>
<P>I will not go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the Federal Government was fully ju&s;tified in its <HI>deci&s;ion</HI> on this important &s;ubject; but I in&s;i&s;t that its con|duct evinced the utmo&s;t partiality for the new <HI>Republic.</HI> When Genet arrived here, it was far from being a&s;certained that the whole, or even a majority, of the French nation, approved of the murder of their &s;overeign, or had abandoned the cau&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The government of America, had, but a few months before, beheld them rai&s;ing their hands to heaven, and &s;wearing to die, if nece&s;&s;ary, in defence of their king. Their con&s;titution, e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>hereditary monar|chy,</HI> had been voluntarily formed, and &s;olemnly &s;anctioned by the whole nation, amid&s;t fe&s;tivals and <HI>Te-Deums,</HI> and had been officially communicated to the world. Each member of the A&s;&s;embly, as well as every individual Frenchman, had repeated|ly &s;worn <Q>to maintain this con&s;titution with all his might.</Q> Laws had been made, puni&s;hing with tran&s;portation all who refu&s;ed to take the oath, and till then unheard-of cruelties had been exer|ci&s;ed on the non-jurors. After all this, was it
<PB N="11" REF="030226_0009_0FE54AE7AAA315B8">
a&s;toni&s;hing that the Federal Government &s;hould, for a moment, he&s;itate to believe, that the nation was really become a Republic, and that this con|&s;titution, about which there had been &s;o much noi&s;e and rejoicing and fea&s;ting and &s;inging and &s;wearing &s;hould be &s;o completely de&s;troyed as to leave neither remnant nor rag vi&s;ible? Mu&s;t they be looked upon as the enemies of France, becau&s;e they did not yield implicit credit to him who fir&s;t told them, that the very men who had declared the king's per&s;on to be <Q>&s;acred and inviolable,</Q> had dipped their hands in his blood; and that the people, who had &s;olemnly vowed to maintain the decree with their lives, had ba&s;ely applauded the &s;anguinary deed?&mdash; It is not the final <HI>determination</HI> of the American government, for that was in favour of the Con|vention, but it is its <HI>he&s;itation,</HI> of which Citizen Adet complains; as if he had &s;aid: <Q>How could you, for a moment, doubt of the faithle&s;sne&s;s of my countrymen? How dur&s;t you he&s;itate to think them, what they have &s;ince &s;o fully proved them&s;elves, a horde of traitors, perjur|ers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins?</Q>&mdash;If the Citizen will but forgive the government this time, I will an&s;wer for them they will never doubt on this &s;ubject again.</P>
<P>But, if it was &s;o very natural for the Federal Government to view the French in their true character, was not that a rea&s;on, on the other hand, for deliberating whether their republican mini&s;ter &s;hould be received in preference to the agents of the Princes? The government had the intere&s;ts of America to attend to in this impor|tant deci&s;ion, as well as tho&s;e of France. A
<PB N="12" REF="030226_0010_0FE54AE9436D9BF8">
weighty debt was due from this country, not to the regenerated nation nor to its bloodthir&s;ty ty|rants, but to Louis XVI <HI>his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</HI> A mini&s;ter from the Republic once admitted, a claim of the intere&s;t of the debt could not be re|fu&s;ed; and if the volatile and perjured nation, had recalled the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of their &s;overeign, would not that &s;ucce&s;&s;or have demanded, and with ju&s;tice, a &s;econd payment of &s;uch intere&s;t? This has not <HI>yet</HI> happened, but it does not follow that it might not have happened. In the common affairs of men, he who has been once convicted of perjury, is never after looked upon as credi|ble; and the &s;ame rule is applicable to &s;ocieties. It is entirely owing to the want of good faith among the allies, and to the da&s;tardly conduct of the Princes them&s;elves, neither of which could well be fore&s;een at the time, that a Bourbon is not now on the throne of France: &s;o that, the Federal Government, in&s;tead of di&s;covering a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition towards the Republic, certainly hazarded much in its favour.</P>
<P>But, con&s;iderations of this nature have no weight with the new &s;overeigns of France. Their object in bringing forward the charge at this time, is, not to impre&s;s on the minds of the people that their government acted unju&s;tly or unwi&s;ely, but that it leaned to the &s;ide of <HI>monarchy</HI> rather than to that of <HI>republicani&s;m.</HI> That this is fal&s;e is clear from the re&s;ult; but were the in&s;inuation ju&s;t, had the government expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;uch a mon&s;ter of a republic as that of France cru&s;hed in its birth, the wi&s;h would have been a mo&s;t pious one.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030226_0011_0FE54AEB62F53030"><HI>Republicani&s;m</HI> is become, for what rea&s;on I know not, &s;ynonymous with <HI>freedom and happi|ne&s;s,</HI> and there are thou&s;ands among us who pre|tend to believe, notwith&s;tanding the terrible ex|ample before their eyes, that men cannot be en|&s;laved under a form of government that is called republican. Mr. Adams, in his <HI>Defence of the American Con&s;titutions,</HI> Vol. I. page 87, &s;ays: <Q>Our countrymen <HI>will never run delirious after a word</HI> or a <HI>name.</HI> The <HI>name republic</HI> is given to things in their nature as different and contradic|tory as light and darkne&s;s, truth and fal&s;ehood, virtue and vice, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. There are <HI>free republics,</HI> and <HI>republics as tyrannical as an oriental de&s;poti&s;m.</HI></Q>&mdash;How fully is the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations exemplified in the republics of America and France! But even this wi&s;e and deep-&s;ighted civilian could not imagine that his countrymen would ever run delirious after a name; much le&s;s could he imagine, that he &s;hould live to &s;ee many of them extolling, as the paragon of republics, a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny that has all the appearance of being an in&s;trument of the wrath of heaven.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this fir&s;t charge again&s;t the go|vernment, with ob&s;erving, that the meanne&s;s equals the impudence of making it. We have &s;een the French murder their king, who&s;e greate&s;t fault was his confidence in <HI>their</HI> fidelity; we have &s;een them drag his headle&s;s and bloody carca&s;s from the &s;caffold, throw it into a pit without the rites of &s;epulture, and, to deprive it of even the privilege of rotting, con&s;ume it with hot lime. Yet, after all this, they are not a&s;hamed to com|plain, that they were not, without he&s;itation, ad|mitted
<PB N="14" REF="030226_0012_0FE54AEF53EBD698">
as heirs his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors! They are not a&s;hamed to enjoy the benefits re&s;ulting from a contract, made with the very man the anniver&s;a|ry of who&s;e murder they celebrate! Like the treacherous labourers, they fir&s;t &s;lay the lord of the vineyard and then &s;eize on his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, his titles and his deeds.&mdash;Men may be unju&s;t and tyrannical, they may even be cruel and ferocious, without being <HI>mean.</HI> There are many a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who would &s;corn to dre&s;s them&s;elves in the robes of their victim. But, to unite vices &s;eemingly incompatible, is the characteri&s;tic of the regene|rated French: in all they &s;ay and do, there is &s;uch a mixture of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ervility, of frivolity and ferocity, of duplicity, in&s;olence and meanne&s;s, that we know not whether to de|&s;pi&s;e or hate them mo&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><Q><HI>2.</HI> The government made a proclamation of <HI>in&s;idious</HI> neutrality.</Q></P>
<P>This charge is as fal&s;e as it is rude. I would beg this well-informed and polite citizen, to name one &s;ingle in&s;tance of the in&s;incerity of the Federal Government, in enforcing this proclama|tion. As applied to the conduct of &s;ome part of the people, indeed, the neutrality might be called <HI>in&s;idious;</HI> but then, this in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s operated in favour of the French and not again&s;t them. There were many who highly approved of the proclamation, and who at the &s;ame time actually made war upon the enemies of France. An ar|my of Americans, under the authority of Genet, invaded the Spani&s;h territories, while privateers were fitted out to cruize on the Briti&s;h; cargoes of ammunition and arms were &s;hipped off, and
<PB N="15" REF="030226_0013_0FE54AF257B2D948">
thank&s;givings, and other public demon&s;trations of joy, were heard from one end of the Union to the other. The bells of the good old Chri&s;tian church, oppo&s;ite me, fired rounds to celebrate the inundation of the Athei&s;tical barbarians into Holland; and the Engli&s;h flag was burnt at Phi|ladelphia, on the public &s;quare, as a &s;acrifice to the godde&s;s of French liberty. The&s;e latter cir|cum&s;tances are trifling in them&s;elves, 'tis true, and certainly excited nothing but contempt and ridicule, in the minds of tho&s;e whom they were intended to in&s;ult; but, the que&s;tion is (and it is to a&s;k this que&s;tion that they are here mentioned), what would the French, that "terrible nation," have &s;aid, had the&s;e in&s;ults, the&s;e marks of an <HI>insidious</HI> neutrality been offered to them? Would they not have &s;ent their fleets and knocked down our towns and burnt our &s;hips? No; the enemy would have &s;topped them on the way; but they would have &s;tirred hell to &s;eek for the means of vengeance. What they had wanted in deeds, they would have made up for in words. Every opprobrious term in their new-fangled vocabula|ry would have been heaped on our heads. How many <HI>sacres m&acirc;tins</HI> and <HI>jean-f&mdash;tres</HI> and <HI>f&mdash;tus chiens</HI> and <HI>libert&eacute;cides</HI> and <HI>neutralit&eacute;cides</HI> would they have called the poor <HI>Anglo-Americans,</HI> in the cour&s;e of a <HI>Decade!</HI> In&s;tead of bell, book and candle, they would have cur&s;ed us with all the gods of their heatheni&s;h calendar; and, which would have been infinitely wor&s;e, they would have cur&s;ed us with the teazing remon&s;trances of an impertinent mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Where a breach of neutrality, cognizable by the laws, appeared, the Federal Government al|ways
<PB N="16" REF="030226_0014_0FE54AF3EBE7C2E8">
did its utmo&s;t to bring the offenders to ju&s;|tice, and it is for this very rea&s;on, that the late diplomatic Moun&s;eer has dared to accu&s;e it of an in&s;idious neutrality. After the proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, and Genet &s;aw that there was no hope of &s;etting it a&s;ide by inciting the people to rebellion, he feigned an acquie&s;cence, and declared that the Convention did not wi&s;h the pro&s;perity of their dear brethren of America to be interrupted by a participation in the war. It entered into his delirious brain, that the proclamation was to be a mere cloak, under which he thought to enli&s;t as many &s;oldiers and arm as many privateers as he could pay for. Such a neutrality would, in|deed, have been more advantageous to France than an open declaration of war on the part of the United States; but when he found that the government was re&s;olved to enforce the procla|mation; when he found that his pirates were not permitted to rob and plunder with impunity, and that the American harbours were not to &s;erve them as hiding places, whence they might &s;ally out upon poor old John Bull, as their great pre|dece&s;&s;or did upon the beeves of Hercules; then he began to foam and <HI>sacre dieu</HI> again&s;t the <HI>liber|t&eacute;cide</HI> government, for <Q>neutralizing the zeal of the citizens, and puni&s;hing the generous children of liberty, for flying to the relief of their mo|ther, when &s;he was upon the point of violation by a horde of crowned mon&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P>As Citizen Adet &s;eems to have been furni&s;hed with memorandums concerning the conduct of all the State Governments, with re&s;pect to the ve&s;&s;els of the belligerent nations; as he mu&s;t be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French archives,</HI> tho&s;e ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="17" REF="030226_0015_0FE54AF62B42CC70">
records of poor Mr. Randolph's precious confe&s;&s;ions, and of the &s;ervices of all tho&s;e who have de&s;erved well of the terrible Republic, it was rather ungrateful of him, to overlook the alertne&s;s of that vigilant and virtuous and cha&s;te and incorruptible republican, Governor Mifflin, at the time of laying the embargo. That vene|rable old Democrat, the father-in-law of Citizen Genet, who has happily given place to a better man, might al&s;o have merited encomium on the &s;ame account. With what care did they watch! With what zeal did they call out the militia, and man whale boats, and run and bu&s;tle about, to prevent the e&s;cape of ve&s;&s;els bound to Briti&s;h ports! Their diligence in the di&s;charge of this part of their duty was not a whit inferior to that of tho&s;e u&s;eful auxiliaries of ju&s;tice, which the rudene&s;s of the&s;e latter times has &s;tyled thief-catchers; while the ve&s;&s;els bound to the land of <HI>Me&s;&s;idor</HI> and <HI>Floreal</HI> and <HI>Vendimaire,</HI> &amp;c. &s;lipped off "in a dark night;" and while, in another quarter, a whole fleet &s;ailed for this land of &s;tarv|ation, though the embargo had been laid ten days before. Had the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter complained of a breach of neutrality here, he might have been heard with patience; but, if even he had had the a&s;&s;urance to make u&s;e of the word <HI>in&s;idious,</HI> he would have merited a peremptory order to pack up.</P>
<P>The only breach of neutrality with which the Federal Government can po&s;&s;ibly be charged, is, the liquidation of the French debt. This favour, as beneficial to France as it was apparently ha|zardous to the United States, would have been acknowledged by Citizen Adet and his ma&s;ters,

<P><Q>Your other letter of the 4th of June, is a powerful demon&s;tration of the intere&s;t which the Republic of France takes in our welfare. I will frankly communicate to you our mea&s;ures and expectations with regard to Algiers; but <HI>as you will so soon receive the detail of those measures,</HI> which your government has pur&s;ued in our be|half, it will be better perhaps to po&s;tpone our

interview on this matter, <HI>until the intelligence which you further expect, &s;hall arrive.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, ob&s;erve here, that Adet tells the people, that &s;omebody in France, no matter who, <HI>had actually commenced negociations</HI> with the regency of Algiers in behalf of their countrymen. To prove this, he quotes a letter of Fauchet, in which this latter begs to call to the recollection of the Fe|deral Government "the &s;teps which <HI>are to be</HI> taken," and not the &s;teps which are taken. Af|terwards Fauchet, pre&s;uming upon what has been done &s;ince his late&s;t in&s;tructions came away, talks in the very &s;ame letter, about mea&s;ures <HI>already taken;</HI> but is unable to &s;ay any thing about the nature or &s;ucce&s;s of them, until he receives <HI>fur|ther information</HI> from Europe, which he makes no doubt is upon the point of arriving.&mdash;Now, is it not very &s;urpri&s;ing that this further information never came to hand, from that day to this? And is it not &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, that no traces of this friendly mediation, of the&s;e &s;teps that <HI>were to be</HI> taken, and tho&s;e mea&s;ures that <HI>were already</HI> taken, &s;hould ever be di&s;covered by the American En|voy to Algiers? When the French do what they can po&s;&s;ibly con&s;true into an act of genero&s;i|ty, they are not very apt to keep it hidden from the world, or to &s;uffer the obliged party to remain unreminded of it.</P>
<P>But, let us hear how Ma&s;ter Adet accounts for his worthy predece&s;&s;or's receiving no <HI>further infor|mation</HI> relative to this generous interference in our behalf. Fauchet told the government he was in daily expectation of it, and yet it never came. How will Citizen Adet get out of this? We have
<PB N="24" REF="030226_0022_0FE54B0A0F9476E0">
him fairly hemmed up in a corner here, and he has a devili&s;h deal more wit than I take him to have, if he gets him&s;elf decently out of it.&mdash; He tells us that the French government had tak|en mea&s;ures for the relief of the captives, that the mediation was in a charming train, that Fau|chet communicated this plea&s;ing intelligence to the Pre&s;ident, who waited with anxious expecta|tion for further information, which Fauchet hour|ly expected to receive, and that <Q><HI>then</HI> Mr. Jay was charged to negociate with the Briti&s;h go|vernment.</Q>&mdash;Well; and what then?&mdash; Why, <Q>and <HI>then</HI> Citizen Fauchet did <HI>not receive</HI> any communication on the &s;ubject.</Q>&mdash;What? &mdash;O, oh! and &s;o <HI>then,</HI> it &s;eems, Mr. Jay's be|ing appointed to negociate a treaty of amity and commerce with king George, prevented the <HI>agree|able information,</HI> <Q>the facts proving the &s;incerity of the French prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip,</Q> from being received! And did &s;o completely do away all tho&s;e &s;teps which <HI>were to be</HI> taken, and which <HI>were taking,</HI> and which <HI>had already been taken,</HI> that they were never after heard of! Sur|pri&s;ing, that the United States &s;hould have chil|led, &s;hould have peri&s;hed even, the zealous in|tere&s;t that France took in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, merely becau&s;e they wi&s;hed to avoid &s;till greater di&s;tre&s;&s;es, by an amicable negociation el&s;ewhere!</P>
<P>Let us recur to time al&s;o. A lie that is bound down to <HI>dates</HI> is difficult to be &s;ucce&s;sfully kept up.</P>
<P>The committee of public &s;afety (it &s;hould have been called the committee of public mi&s;ery) in&s;tructed Citizen Fauchet on the 5th of January, 1794, to inform the American government, that
<PB N="25" REF="030226_0023_0FE54B0C280861F0">
they were about taking means for "breaking the chains of our captive citizens in Algiers." This "proof of the prote&s;tations of their friend&s;hip" did not come to Fauchet's hands till the 4th of the en&s;uing June, ju&s;t five months, to an hour; and when it did at la&s;t arrive, Citizen Fauchet, <HI>could not tell by what route!</HI>&mdash;A pretty &s;tory this, and a pretty &s;ort of Amba&s;&s;ador to receive di&s;|patches of &s;uch importance, without knowing <HI>by whom</HI> or <HI>by what route.</HI> Let Citizen Adet and his worthy predece&s;&s;or, Father Jo&s;eph, go and im|po&s;e &s;uch humbug tales upon the poor &s;tupid en|&s;laved Hollanders and Geneve&s;e, they will find few &s;uch gulls here.</P>
<P>Again: how could the appointment of Mr. Jay prevent the reception of <HI>further information,</HI> if &s;uch information was daily expected? Robe|&s;pierre and his bloody colleagues, who felt &s;uch a tender concern for the captives, could not hear of this appointment &s;ooner than about two months after it took place; the information, promi&s;ed, as they &s;ay, on the 5th of January, mu&s;t therefore have been on the way, and what, then, I would be glad to know, prevented its coming to hand? That it <HI>never</HI> did come to hand, Ma&s;ter Adet has confe&s;&s;ed, and we mu&s;t inevitably conclude there-from, that it was never either promi&s;ed on that &s;ide the water or expected on this.&mdash;The&s;e dates form a net in which the Citizen has hampered him&s;elf. He had got the <HI>Me&s;&s;idors</HI> and the <HI>Fructi|dors</HI> into his brains, and could he have got them into ours al&s;o, could he have made us adopt the bea&s;tial calendar of <HI>Poor Richard,</HI> we might have lo&s;t our account too, but by &s;ticking to the good old June and January we have caught him out.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030226_0024_0FE54B12DFE1AEA0">The fact is, the committee of public mi&s;ery never took any &s;teps towards a mediation, ne|ver wrote any letter to Fauchet on the &s;ubject, nor did this latter ever expect any information relative thereto. The whole was a mere trumped up &s;tory to induce the Pre&s;ident to relinqui&s;h his purpo&s;e of a pacific negociation with Great Bri|tain, by giving him a high opinion of the friend|&s;hip of France and leading him to depend on her for &s;upport. Had the Pre&s;ident been the dupe they expected he was, we might have bidden an eternal farewel to <HI>independence.</HI> If Robe&s;pierre and the Convention had once got a hold of him, he would in vain have &s;truggled to get free: their fra|ternal hug would have been a million times more fa|tal to us than the grapples of the Algerine galleys to the crews of our &s;hips.&mdash;Ob&s;erve how anxious Fauchet was to obtain &s;ome <HI>overture</HI> on the part of the Pre&s;ident: <Q><HI>I pray you to invite the Pre|&s;ident</HI> to cau&s;e to be communicated to me the means which he will join to tho&s;e of the committee of public &s;afety.</Q> This was all Fauchet wanted him to do; to a&s;k &s;ome favour or other. I doubt not but they would have really interpo&s;ed with their brother barbarians for the liberation of the cap|tives; but the chains which they would have knocked off from a handful of Americans, would have been rivetted on America for ever. The Pre&s;ident &s;aw the &s;nare, and, with his u&s;ual &s;aga|city, avoided it; and thus pre&s;erved him&s;elf and his country from di&s;grace and ruin.</P>
<P>The motive for advancing the charge at this time, is, to in&s;til into the minds of the people, that the Pre&s;ident felt extremely indifferent as to the fate of the captives. This ba&s;e, this calum|nious,

If there be an American, who ap|proves of the late revolution, and who e&s;teems him&s;elf happy under the change which it has pro|duced, and who yet has not the courage to re|&s;ent this audacious a&s;per&s;ion of the character of General Wa&s;hington, he de&s;erves to be curtailed of the &s;igns of manhood: &s;uch a pu&s;illanimous reptile ought not to be &s;uffered to propagate his breed.</P>

<P>It is a wonder Citizen Adet did not &s;well the li&s;t here. He might, with equal rea&s;on, have complained that the Federal Government <HI>allowed</HI> the Briti&s;h to conquer the half of the&s;e colonies; that they <HI>allowed</HI> Lords <HI>Howe, Hood</HI> and <HI>Brid|port</HI> to de&s;troy their fleets; and that they <HI>allowed</HI> Prince Charles to beat and pur&s;ue their boa&s;ting army. He might have complained, that they are about to <HI>allow</HI> the &s;ans-culotte general <HI>Moreau</HI> to be Burgoyened, and the ruffian <HI>Buonaparte</HI> and his wolfi&s;h comrades to leave their lank carca&s;&s;es in Italy, which I hope and believe will be <HI>allowed.</HI> Had he complained, that they <HI>allowed</HI> it to rain, to &s;now and to thunder, his complaint would not have been more ab&s;urd than it now is.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030226_0026_0FE54B16587E2058">But, the government al&s;o <HI>allowed</HI> <Q>the Ame|rican citizens to be interdicted the right of trading to the&s;e colonies.</Q>&mdash;As to the <HI>power</HI> of preventing this, the &s;ame may be &s;aid as of the prohibitions above &s;uppo&s;ed; and as to the <HI>right</HI> of preventing it, if the power had exi&s;ted, no|thing can be &s;aid, unle&s;s we knew the exact &s;tate of the blockades, to which the Citizen alludes, but of which his <HI>Blunderbu&s;s</HI> gives no particular account.</P>
<P>When a place, or an i&s;land, is actually in|ve&s;ted in &s;uch manner as to enable the be&s;ieger to prevent neutrals from entering, he has a right, according to the immemorially e&s;tabli&s;hed law of nations, not only to exerci&s;e this power of pre|vention, but to &s;eize on, and confi&s;cate, both goods and ve&s;&s;els; and even to inflict corporal puni&s;hment on all tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s his prohi|bition. That the Briti&s;h have &s;ometimes declared places in a &s;tate of &s;iege, which were not really inve&s;ted, has often been a&s;&s;erted, but never prov|ed; but it is well known, on the other hand, that they never went to the rigour of the law of nations with tho&s;e who had the temerity to di&s;re|gard their prohibitions, in attempting to enter places which were completely blockaded.</P>
<P>Numerous complaints of captures, made at the entrance of the ports of an i&s;land, amount to a pretty &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof, that the captor has formed an actual inve&s;titure. If he has done this, he certainly has a right to declare it, and it follows of cour&s;e, that no neutral power has a right to take offence at his declaration. When one of the neutral captains complained, that the
<PB N="29" REF="030226_0027_0FE54B1889586138">
Briti&s;h <HI>intercepted, and &s;eized on, every ve&s;&s;el</HI> that attempted to enter the port of St. Pierre's, and, in the very &s;ame letter, inveighed again&s;t <HI>the ille|gality of their declaring the place in a &s;tate of blockade,</HI> he talked like a good hone&s;t tar; and when we hear a public mini&s;ter echoing the complaint, we may pardon his ignorance, but we cannot help wi&s;hing, at the &s;ame time, that he had been &s;ent to hand reef and &s;teer, &s;tew up lob&s;cous, or &s;wab the deck, rather than to pe&s;ter us with his boor|i&s;h grumbling and tarpawling logic.</P>
<P>Where a merchant, or a mariner, through love to the be&s;ieged, or hatred to the be&s;ieger, through avarice or through indi&s;cretion, has lo&s;t his pro|perty by an endeavour to elude the prohibition of trading to a blockaded place, it is very natu|ral, and therefore perhaps excu&s;able, in him to be vociferous in complaint again&s;t the inju&s;tice of the captor; but it is not quite &s;o natural or excu&s;able in his government to participate in his re&s;ent|ment, and plunge the nation into a war to avenge him. Were the harmony of nations to be di&s;|turbed by the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals, peace mu&s;t take her flight to heaven, for &s;he would never find a re&s;ting place on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>It is, however, certain, that very many of the captures, made by the Briti&s;h cruizers, were con|trary to the law of nations, and therefore called for the interpo&s;ition of the general government. And has not that government interpo&s;ed? Yes, and &s;o effectually too, that a mode of indemnifi|cation, as equitable and as honourable as either party could wi&s;h for, has been firmly &s;ettled on. Sup|po&s;ing,
<PB N="30" REF="030226_0028_0FE54B1EF5B321A0">
then, for a moment, that France had a right to make inquiries on the &s;ubject, what more does &s;he want? Strange as it may &s;eem, to tho&s;e who are inattentive to the intrigues of this at once volatile, ferocious and artful republic, it is the &s;ucce&s;s of the negociation, by which this very indemnification was obtained, that has occa&s;ion|ed the charge now preferred by her mini&s;ter! The French, or rather the French U&s;urpers, re|joiced at the Briti&s;h depredations on the com|merce of this country: nothing was farther from their wi&s;hes than to &s;ee the &s;ufferers indemnified.

<P>To this charge re&s;pecting blockades and the &s;eizure of American ve&s;&s;els, may be added that which Citizen Adet makes with regard to the im|pre&s;&s;ment of &s;eamen from on board of tho&s;e and other ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The complaint again&s;t Briti&s;h impre&s;&s;ments has &s;o often been the &s;ubject of public debate and private animadver&s;ion, that it would &s;eem unne|ce&s;&s;ary to dwell on it here; yet, as I do not re|collect ever having &s;een it placed in a fair point of view, to attempt doing it at this time can be productive of no harm.</P>

<P>And is it not <HI>ju&s;t</HI> that the &s;tate which has bred, nouri&s;hed and protected you, &s;hould have a title to your allegiance? A fool might &s;ay, as I heard a philo&s;ophical fool lately &s;ay, with Goodwin's

political ju&s;tice in his hand; <Q>I could not avoid being born in your &s;tate.</Q> But, ungrateful fool, the &s;tate might have avoided &s;heltering you under its wings, and &s;uffering you to grow up to manhood. It might have expelled you the &s;ocie|ty, ca&s;t you out to live among the bea&s;ts, or have thrown you into the &s;ea, had it not been withheld by that law, that ju&s;tice, which now &s;anctions its claim on your allegiance. To &s;ay, that you "never <HI>a&s;ked for protection,</HI>" is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that you never <HI>asked to be born.</HI> Had your very fir&s;t cry been a renunciation of protec|tion, it would not have invalidated the claim of the &s;tate; for you were protected in your mo|ther's womb. Should the &s;tate now withdraw its protection from you, and leave you to the mercy of the plunderer and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or drive you out from its boundaries, without any forfeiture on your part; would you not exclaim again&s;t &s;uch a &s;tep as an act of brutal inju&s;tice? And yet this is no more unju&s;t than for you to withdraw your allegi|ance, ca&s;t the &s;tate from you, and leave it to the mercy of its foes. The obligation here is per|fectly reciprocal; as the &s;tate cannot, by its own arbitrary will, withhold that protection which is the birthright of every individual &s;ubject, &s;o no &s;ub|ject can, by his arbitrary will, alienate that alle|giance which is the right of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The <HI>general policy</HI> too, the mutual intere&s;t of nations, in &s;upporting this principle, is &s;o evident, that nothing but the influence of the wild and barbarian doctrines of the regenerated French can account for its having been di&s;puted. &mdash;If men could alienate their allegiance at plea|&s;ure, they could al&s;o transfer it at plea&s;ure and

then, into what confu&s;ion would not mankind be plunged? Where &s;hould we look for the di&s;tinc|tive mark of nations, and where find the &s;tand|ard of right and of duty?</P>
<P>Let us illu&s;trate the excellence of this policy by an example of what might re&s;ult from its con|trary, and at the &s;ame time bring the que&s;tion home to America.&mdash;It is very natural that the people of this country &s;hould wi&s;h to draw the &s;eamen from other countries and claim them as hers, but let us &s;ee how this doctrine would &s;uit when brought into operation again&s;t her&s;elf.&mdash;Sup|po&s;e a war (which God forbid) &s;hould break out between America and Great Britain, and that &s;ome of the citizens or &s;ubjects of the&s;e &s;tates &s;hould be found on board the enemy's ve&s;&s;els making war upon their country; in this ca&s;e, America would have no right to puni&s;h them, ac|cording to the new doctrine, if they declared that they had transferred their allegiance to Britain. We may bring the evil &s;till nearer to our doors, and a&s;&s;ert, that even de&s;erters to an enemy, land|ed in the country, would al&s;o claim exemption from puni&s;hment.&mdash;It will not do to &s;ay, that this would be <HI>trea&s;on.</HI> If allegiance be transferrable, the transfer may take place for all purpo&s;es, at all times, and in all places; for war as well as for peace; in the hour of danger as well as in the hour of &s;ecurity; on this &s;ide of the &s;ea as well as on the other; in the camp as well as in the city.&mdash;This wild doctrine once e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>trea|&s;on</HI> would become a duty, or rather there could be no &s;uch thing as a <HI>traitor</HI> in the world. The barriers of &s;ociety would be broken into &s;hivers: the di&s;contented of every community would be

tempted, and would moreover have a right, to abandon, betray and make war upon their coun|try.</P>
<P>Applying what has been &s;aid to the complaint now before us, we &s;hall find, that the people re|&s;iding in the&s;e States at the time their indepen|dence was acknowledged, and tho&s;e who have been born in them &s;ince that time, are not &s;ub|jects of Great Britain; and that, all who have emigrated from the dominions of Britain &s;ince that epoch are her &s;ubjects. It is very certain that nearly all the impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen were of this latter de&s;cription, and were therefore &s;till &s;ubject to the laws of their country and the regulations of their &s;overeign, when found in any part of his or his enemy's dominions, or upon the high &s;eas. The&s;e regulations authorized his officers to impre&s;s them, and therefore they were impre&s;&s;ed. That their impre&s;&s;ment was frequently a very great lo&s;s to their employers might be &s;ubject of regret, but the government of the United States had no more right to complain of it, than that of Bri|tain had to complain of their being employed.</P>
<P>The heatheni&s;h French are certainly the la&s;t people in the world to hold up as an example to Chri&s;tian nations; but, where their practice is &s;o exactly contrary to the principles they pretend to profe&s;s, it is worth noticing.&mdash;Let it be ob&s;erved, then, that they have taken thou&s;ands of <HI>their</HI> emigrants, <HI>without the limits of their territory,</HI> who had renounced their protection; yet every &s;oul of them were put to the &s;word; not as Au|&s;trians, Engli&s;h or Dutch, but as Frenchmen, who &s;till owed allegiance to France, and as &s;uch
<PB N="35" REF="030226_0033_0FE54B2CB423BF70">
were dealt with as <HI>traitors.</HI> Now I humbly reque&s;t the Citizen mini&s;ter of the "terrible" bloody nation to tell me, what claim France had to the allegiance of the&s;e emigrants, if Britain had none to her emigrated &s;ailors? It will not &s;erve his turn, to &s;ay that they were found with arms in their hands, that circum&s;tance alone could not render them &s;ubjects of France; and be&s;ides, the Briti&s;h &s;ailors might have been found in arms too: a neutral allegiance is no allegiance at all.</P>
<P>But, to come &s;till clo&s;er to the point; the French &s;eized &s;everal of their emigrants <HI>without arms in their hands,</HI> on the high &s;eas, pur&s;uing their peaceable commerce, <HI>on board of neutral ves|sels</HI> too, yea even on board of <HI>American vessels.</HI> Every man of the&s;e they al&s;o put to death; &s;ome they dragged on &s;hore to the guillotine, others they threw into the &s;ea alive, and others they hewed down with their &s;abres. Therefore, un|le&s;s Citizen Adet will frankly declare, like a good full-blooded &s;ans-culotte, that it is ju&s;tifia|ble for a nation to claim the allegiance and &s;eize on the per&s;ons of its Emigrants, only for the purpo&s;e of cutting their throats, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that the practice of his nation gives the lie direct to the principle on which his charge is founded.</P>
<P>It is a phenomenon in politics for a French mini&s;ter to exert his <HI>humane</HI> influence in behalf of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. How kind it was of the Con|vention to endeavour to extend their fatherly protection to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen! With what a philanthropic warmth they expre&s;s their con|cern for them! They are devili&s;h careful of the bacon of a Briti&s;h tar, when they want to pre|vent

him from being brought into action again&s;t them; but when they have got him in their clutch|es they are not quite &s;o tender of him. They have &s;tarved thou&s;ands of Briti&s;h pri&s;oners this war. They were fed on rotten herbage for months together. They crammed them into dungeons, or rather charnel hou&s;es, and gave them <HI>limed water</HI> to moi&s;ten their dirty food. Above three thou&s;and of the&s;e poor fellows, ex|pired with burning entrails, in the different &s;ea|ports of the treacherous and inhuman republic, only becau&s;e they remained faithful to their country and loyal to their king.</P>
<P>I now come to the other de&s;cription of impre&s;&s;|ed &s;eamen: tho&s;e who owed allegiance to America alone. And here I frankly declare, that I believe, many acts of rudene&s;s, in&s;olence, and even tyranny, have been committed by particular offi|cers; for there are &s;ome of them that would pre&s;s their own mothers, if they were capable of &s;tand|ing before the ma&s;t. But, I can never credit all the lamentable &s;tories that the hirelings of France have &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated on this &s;ubject. After a mo&s;t piteous and pitiful picture of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen, drawn by that able painter, the taper-limbed and golden-hued Adonis of New York, who has been aptly enough compared to a poplar tree in autumn; after as vi|gilant and &s;piteful an inquiry as ever was pro&s;ecut|ed by the &s;pirit of faction, not more than <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen, of the de&s;cription we are now &s;peaking of, could be <HI>named;</HI> and with re&s;pect to the&s;e, the report of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate proved, that, where proper application had been made for
<PB N="37" REF="030226_0035_0FE54B30AF42C910">
their enlargement, it had always been immediately attended to, and had produced the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>It was in the cour&s;e of this memorable inve&s;ti|gation, that the generous Mr. Living&s;ton propo&s;ed to furni&s;h the Briti&s;h &s;eamen, on board American ve&s;&s;els, with certificates of naturalization. The&s;e were intended to operate as a charm on the paws and bludgeons of the Engli&s;h pre&s;s-gangs, or, at lea&s;t, it is difficult to conceive for what other purpo&s;e they were intended. Was there any man in Con|gre&s;s fool enough imagine, that the ju&s;t claims of one nation could be annulled by the production of bits of &s;ealed paper given to her &s;ubjects by ano|ther nation? The particular act, or the general law, by which foreigners are naturalized, may admit them to a participation in all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the citizens of the &s;tate adopting them (which is, indeed, the &s;ole end of naturalization), but can never weaken the claim of the parent &s;tate; otherwi&s;e <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>de&s;erters,</HI> by producing <HI>certificates of naturaliza|tion,</HI> might bid defiance to the ju&s;t vengeance of their injured country.</P>
<P>As to the mea&s;ures taken by the Federal Go|vernment, relative to the impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen, they were &s;uch as the peculiar &s;ituation of America rendered wi&s;e. Mr. Jay endeavoured to obtain a &s;tipulation, by which Briti&s;h &s;eamen, found on board American ve&s;&s;els, would have been ex|empted from the operation of the impre&s;s orders. This Great Britain refu&s;ed, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that nations as well as individuals generally re|fu&s;e to make a gratuitous &s;acrifice of what be|longs

to them. Agents have &s;ince been appoint|ed to attend to impre&s;&s;ments, and when their in|terpo&s;ition is warranted by the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, there is every appearance that it will be produc|tive of the end propo&s;ed, and that both parties will readily co-operate for the pre&s;ervation of harmony.</P>
<P>But, it is this cur&s;ed harmony that Citizen Adet and his ma&s;ters do not approve of. They wi&s;h the government of the United States to imi|tate them, a&s;&s;ume the tone of bullies, and &s;o get into a war; or, at lea&s;t, they wi&s;h Great Britain to be compelled to relinqui&s;h her claim to her &s;ailors, while &s;he &s;tands in need of them to fight again&s;t her enemies. The former of the&s;e will not happen, in &s;pite of French envy and malice; and as to the latter, it will never take place while Britain is able to beat France, Spain and Holland, on the &s;eas, and that I tru&s;t &s;he will be as long as there are men of war in the world and &s;eas for them to fight on.</P>
<P>Thus far have I proceeded on this &s;ubject for the &s;atisfaction of my reader: what remains to be &s;aid on it is intended for the &s;atisfaction of Citizen Adet alone.&mdash;And now then, you ter|rible Envoy of the "terrible nation," be &s;o po|lite for once as to tell me, what bu&s;ine&s;s you, or your worthy predece&s;&s;ors, had to meddle or make with the impre&s;&s;ment of American &s;ailors.

Yet you have had the a&s;&s;urance to repeat the que&s;tion, couched in &s;till more hector|ing and menacing terms, and pretend to be of|fended becau&s;e the government has not deigned to make you a reply.&mdash;When your Convention were dragging their &s;overeign to a mock trial, and condemning him to an ignominious death, in open defiance of all law and ju&s;tice; cutting off his unfortunate &s;i&s;ter and queen, after having drenched them with the dregs of humiliation, ten times bitterer than death; cramming his &s;on, an in|nocent child, into a dungeon, ordering him to be kept from &s;leep, and finally&mdash;my pen refu&s;es to trace the da&s;tardly, the horrid deed. When they were butchering, by thou&s;ands, the faithful inhabitants of Lyons, and the brave pea|&s;ants of La Vend&eacute;e, who&s;e names will be remem|bered with honour and renown, when their a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins will be howling in hell; when they were in the mid&s;t of this ba&s;e and bloody work, what would they have &s;aid, had the government of America called on them to hold their hands?

<P N="6"><Q><HI>6.</HI> The Federal Government eluded all the ad|vances made by the French Republic for renew|ing the <HI>treaties of commerce</HI> upon a more fa|vourable footing to both nations.</Q></P>
<P>What does this learned Citizen mean by <HI>trea|ties of commerce?</HI> This country has but one trea|ty of <HI>commerce</HI> with France: the other is a treaty <HI>"eventual and defen&s;ive."</HI> Perhaps, indeed, he may regard <HI>war</HI> as a &s;pecies of commerce; and it mu&s;t be allowed that this is the only commerce that can be carried on with his terrible republic at pre&s;ent. The kind of trucking commerce that &s;he is carrying on in Italy, where &s;he purcha&s;es a &s;tatue or a picture with the lives of ten thou|&s;and &s;oldiers, may, to her, be advantageous enough, becau&s;e &s;he is a <HI>rich</HI> lady and a virtuo&s;o; but to America, who is a plain homely dame, and has but little ta&s;te for &s;uch fine things, this commerce

has but few charms: to her, one live farmer is of higher e&s;timation than all the heroes and gods of antiquity.</P>
<P>I rather think, however, that Citizen Adet, ig|norant as he may be, knows that a defen&s;ive treaty is not a treaty of commerce; and if &s;o, he mu&s;t know that there was but one treaty of commerce between the countries. But there were <HI>two treaties</HI> to be <HI>renewed,</HI> and, as it has always been held up to the people here, that their dear friends of France did not wi&s;h their pro&s;perity to be inter|rupted by taking a part in the war, it would not do to talk about renewing a <HI>defen&s;ive treaty;</HI> that would have &s;melt of powder: yet he could not &s;ay, that the treaty of <HI>commerce only</HI> was propo&s;ed to be renewed, and &s;o he has called them both trea|ties of commerce. The Citizen was hemmed in between a lie and an ab&s;urdity, and, to the cre|dit of his morality, he has cho&s;en the latter.</P>
<P>That the ground work of a new treaty, or a renewed treaty, with France, was to be our going to war with her enemies, has been &s;o often and &s;o inconte&s;tibly proved, that the fact is now uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged, except by the &s;tipenda|ries of that pure-principled republic. But, were a proof yet wanting, Citizen Adet has furni&s;hed it, in the la&s;t page of his <HI>Diplomatic Blunderbu&s;s.</HI> Here he tells us, that both Genet and Fauchet u&s;ed their utmo&s;t to draw the government into a negociation, but in vain; that it eluded all their friendly overtures.&mdash;Yes, and &s;o it did indeed; ju&s;t as the &s;heep eludes the friendly overtures of the wolf, and for much about the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>

If you had nothing to propo&s;e but <Q><HI>treaties of</HI> commerce, <HI>up|on a footing</HI> more favourable to both nations,</Q> how could the treaty with Great Britain prevent the pur&s;uit of your negociation?&mdash;The rea&s;on is plain: this treaty had happily put an end to all the di&s;putes between America and Britain, and left you no room to hope that your negociation would rekindle the embers of di&s;cord. It was this con&s;ideration, and this alone, that thwarted your negociations, that has &s;ince &s;et the gall of your ma&s;ters afloat, and that has now brought forth your impudent appeal from the government to the people.</P>
<P>The only que&s;tion for the people to determine, then, is&mdash;not whether they wi&s;hed the treaties to be renewed, but whether they wi&s;hed for war, or not; and this que&s;tion they have already deter|mined <HI>in the negative.</HI> There once &s;tood a ma|jority in Congre&s;s ready to &s;et the Briti&s;h treaty a&s;ide, and plunge this country into a war with that na|tion.

<P>The charge proceeds to a&s;&s;ert, that the govern|ment <Q>pro&s;tituted <HI>its neutrality, and</HI> sacrificed France to her enemies.</Q>&mdash;This is too vague to be taken up as it lies before us; except, indeed, it be the word <HI>pro&s;tituted,</HI> which may be di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed at once, by ob&s;erving that it mu&s;t have been picked up in the purlieus of the <HI>Palais-Royal,</HI> a place of which the Iri&s;h-Town of Philadelphia is a picture in miniature. To avoid the indecency therefore of joining it with the American govern|ment, I &s;hall &s;upply its place by the word <HI>gave up.</HI></P>
<P>What the polite Citizen chiefly alludes to then, in &s;aying, that the government gave up its neu|trality and &s;acrificed France to her enemies, is, that article of the Briti&s;h treaty which contains the &s;tipulation re&s;pecting an enemy's goods, found
<PB N="46" REF="030226_0044_0FE54B4E6C4E7BC8">
on board the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, when the&s;e latter are neutral, with re&s;pect to Great Britain.</P>
<P>Want of room prevents me from entering ful|ly into this &s;ubject, or I &s;hould not de&s;pair of &s;tripping off all the million of ab&s;urdities, mi&s;|repre&s;entations and downright fal&s;ehoods, in which the <HI>pro&s;tituted</HI> (here this word &s;ounds well) partizans of France have di&s;gui&s;ed it. Perhaps, however, if I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to place it in a clear light, brevity may be no di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulation of the treaty which we are about to examine, in &s;ub&s;tance &s;ays, that an ene|my's goods found on board the ve&s;&s;els of the con|tracting parties, &s;hall be looked upon as lawful prize. This, &s;ays Citizen Adet, is a violation of the <HI>modern</HI> law of nations; and this, &s;ays the go|vernment, is no &s;uch thing. As here is a flat contradiction, &s;omebody mu&s;t tell a lie; who it is I know not, but I am &s;ure it is not the government at any rate.</P>
<P>Within what limits Citizen Adet means to cir|cum&s;cribe the word <HI>modern,</HI> I cannot exactly a&s;|certain; but as, in another part of his Blunder|bu&s;s, he calls France the <HI>ancient ally</HI> of America, and as it is well known that this alliance began but <HI>eighteen years and ten months ago,</HI> it is probable he looks upon that only as the modern law of na|tions which commenced its operation at &s;ome time po&s;terior to that epoch. Indeed, it is pretty clear that he &s;uppo&s;es the modern law of nations to date its beginning from what he calls the <Q>New
<PB N="47" REF="030226_0045_0FE54B511BAA0FD0">
Style;</Q> and, in that ca&s;e, thank heaven, we are ancients yet.</P>
<P>But, however cramped the &s;ignification may be, that this &s;on of <HI>Floreal</HI> and <HI>Fructidor</HI> plea&s;es to give to the word <HI>modern,</HI> we <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> know, that the modern law of nations means, that pub|lic law, or rather practice, which the modern nations of Europe have ob&s;erved towards each other. Now, with re&s;pect to commerce with an enemy, whoever examines the be&s;t writers on the &s;ubject, will find that, long &s;ince the&s;e nations a&s;&s;umed nearly their pre&s;ent relative &s;tate, it was the <HI>general practice</HI> to prohibit <HI>all trade whatever</HI> with an enemy.</P>
<P>As the nations grew more poli&s;hed, and as their relations increa&s;ed by means of maritime commerce, the rigour of this practice was gradu|ally &s;oftened, till confi&s;cation was at la&s;t confined to the ve&s;&s;els and property of enemies, to certain articles termed contraband of war, and to the <HI>property of enemies found on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far the relaxation became pretty general about the time of Queen Elizabeth. But &s;ome powers wi&s;hed to extend the freedom of com|merce &s;till further; even &s;o far as <HI>to protect ene|mies' goods found on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els;</HI> and to do this the Queen of England was one of the fir&s;t to a&s;&s;ert her right. The right was, however, di&s;puted, and that too by the United Provinces, even before their independence was fully a&s;&s;ured. They took &s;ome of her ve&s;&s;els laden with Spani&s;h property, and condemned the cargoes, without
<PB N="48" REF="030226_0046_0FE54B52AE433748">
paying freightage. The Queen at fir&s;t re&s;ented this conduct in an infant &s;tate that was chiefly in|debted to her for &s;upport; but, notwith&s;tanding the well known tenacity and imperiou&s;ne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, her wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice prevailed, and &s;he at la&s;t acquie&s;ced in the legality of the cap|tures.&mdash;Here then we have an in&s;tance of the prac|tice of a nation of <HI>modern birth,</HI> a <HI>republic</HI> al&s;o, and a republic <HI>engaged in a revolutionary war.</HI></P>
<P>I have at lea&s;t a hundred examples of this na|ture now before me. But let us de&s;cend to &s;till more <HI>modern</HI> times, and that the example may be, if po&s;&s;ible, yet more &s;trikingly applicable, let us appeal to the practice of the French nation it&s;elf.&mdash;The famous <HI>Ordinance</HI> of 1681, which might be called the navigation act of France, ex|pre&s;sly declared to be good prize, not only the enemy's goods on board of a neutral ve&s;&s;el, but <HI>the neutral ve&s;sel al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>We are now got down to the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century; but as that may not be quite <HI>modern</HI> enough for our <HI>Decadery</HI> Moun&s;eer, let us conti|nue to de&s;cend, &s;till continuing our appeal to the practice of his own country.&mdash;The <HI>Ordinance</HI> of 1681 was mitigated by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive treaties, in which France, according as her intere&s;t pre&s;cribed, re|fu&s;ed, or granted, the permi&s;&s;ion which Citizen Adet now &s;ets up as a right: but, after the&s;e trea|ties, and even &s;o late as 1757, &s;he declared to the republic of Holland, that if any goods <HI>belonging to her enemy</HI> were found on board of Dutch ve&s;|&s;els, &s;uch goods &s;hould be condemned as good prize, and to this declaration her practice was conformable, during the whole war which ended
<PB N="49" REF="030226_0047_0FE54B54E8DB2AE0">
in 1763, only <HI>thirty-three years ago.</HI> So that, un|le&s;s this man of the "New Style" will ab&s;olutely &s;ans-culotte us, and in&s;i&s;t upon it that our fathers were antediluvians, and that we our&s;elves were born in the ages of antiquity, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, on our part, that the principle adhered to in the treaty between Great Britain and America, is a principle of the <HI>modern law of nations,</HI> and more|over is &s;anctioned by the practice of France.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the Citizen, <HI>France adopted a differ|ent principle in her treaty with America.</HI>&mdash;France had her intere&s;ted motives for that, of which I could &s;ay a great deal more if I plea&s;ed. Let that be as it may; what had her treaty to do with Great Britain? She is <HI>independent</HI> I hope, if Ame|rica is not. France did not "work her liberty" too, I humbly pre&s;ume; and I pre&s;ume al&s;o, that the treaty between America and France is not the code to which all the modern nations are to appeal for a deci&s;ion of their rights.&mdash;The fact is, this principle is either adopted, or not adopted, according to the intere&s;ts and &s;ituations of the contracting parties: as the&s;e vary, nations act dif|ferently at different times and towards different nations. It is a matter merely conventional and &s;olely dependent on circum&s;tances, as much as any other &s;tipulation of a treaty.</P>
<P>The Citizen has one more fetch; which I think is the mo&s;t impudent piece of &s;ophi&s;try that ever was attempted to be palmed upon a nation. A nation, did I &s;ay! Why, a nation of Indians would have tomahawked him, and we &s;hould now &s;ee his &s;kin hanging up in the &s;hops for &s;ale, had he offered to chou&s;e them in &s;uch a barefaced man|ner.&mdash;I
<PB N="50" REF="030226_0048_0FE54B5833100580">
allude to that part of his Blunderbu&s;s, where he &s;ays, that America violated her treaty with France, by <HI>granting</HI> to Britain the <HI>favour</HI> of &s;eizure, which &s;he had not <HI>granted</HI> to France, though &s;he was to be treated in the &s;ame manner as "the <HI>mo&s;t favoured nation.</HI>"</P>
<P>The &s;ophi&s;try of this con&s;i&s;ts in confounding <HI>fa|vour</HI> with <HI>right,</HI> terms almo&s;t as oppo&s;ite in &s;igni|fication as <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI>&mdash;America confer|red <HI>no favour,</HI> when, by treaty, &s;he declared that Great Britain &s;hould &s;eize enemies' goods on board of her ve&s;&s;els: &s;he only acknowledged the exi&s;tence of Great Britain's right &s;o to do. Nor was this acknowledgment ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: but, &s;ome nations having retained the exerci&s;e of the right and others having relinqui&s;hed it, it was a prudent precaution again&s;t future di&s;putes, to declare, by expre&s;s &s;tipulation, whether it was retained or relinqui&s;hed in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is clear therefore, that the &s;tipulation in the treaty with France, which &s;ays, that &s;he <Q>&s;hall be treated in the &s;ame manner as <HI>the mo&s;t favoured nation,</HI></Q> mu&s;t be totally inapplicable to a ca&s;e, wherein no <HI>favour</HI> is, or can be, con|ferred. However, as the con&s;truction given to this has been the ground-work of much com|plaint and even calumny, it may not be ami&s;s here to explain its true meaning.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulation for <HI>equal favour</HI> then, which is to be found in mo&s;t treaties of commerce now exi&s;ting in the world, extends to the effects of the munici|pal laws and regulations of the contracting par|ties. It implies an <HI>equality in duties,</HI> in <HI>tonnage,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="030226_0049_0FE54B5B119841D8">
in the permi&s;&s;ion <HI>to have con&s;uls;</HI> all which, and many others, may properly be called <HI>favours:</HI> but, it can never be con&s;trued to extend to any one of the great rights of national &s;overeignty. If this were the ca&s;e, all the advantageous &s;tipu|lations of a treaty made with one power, would be applicable to every other power, in a treaty with which this u&s;ual &s;tipulation for equal favour was found: and of this we &s;hall &s;ee the mon|&s;trous ab&s;urdity in a minute.&mdash;America, for in&s;tance, has treaties with Spain, Great Britain and France, in all which the &s;tipulation for equal favour exi&s;ts. In the treaty with Spain, America allows to that nation a free navigation on the American part of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; but does &s;he al|low this to Britain and France? In that with Great Britain, America allows her a free naviga|tion and trade on her rivers, lakes, &amp;c. and Bri|tain allows the &s;ame freedom to America on hers; but does either of them extend this permi&s;&s;ion to France or Spain, or any other nation? Yet they are obliged to do this, if the &s;tipulation for <HI>equal favour</HI> admits of the con&s;truction, which the ma|ritime Goths wi&s;h to impo&s;e on us, in &s;upport of their attack on the commerce of America.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject then is thus brought to a clo&s;e: the &s;eizure of an enemy's goods on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els is a right of national &s;overeignty, which every <HI>independent</HI> nation may, in her treaties, re|tain or give up, according to the dictates of her intere&s;ts or her will. In the treaty between Britain and America this right is reciprocally retained; in that between America and France it is recipro|cally given up. Great Britain naturally adheres to her treaty; America adheres to hers with both nations; and it only remains for us to &s;ee how
<PB N="52" REF="030226_0050_0FE54B5CAA040AE0">
that between America and France has been ad|hered to, by the de&s;pots who have &s;eized on the wealth and the power of that unfortunate nation.</P>
<P>Soon after the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, the Convention ordered all enemy's goods on board of American ve&s;&s;els to be &s;eized, notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive &s;tipulation to the contrary. This order, dictated by the in&s;olence of &s;ucce&s;s, was con&s;equent|ly revoked, when the &s;cale of victory turned. After this, the fami&s;hed &s;tate, to which the infernal re|volution had reduced that once flouri&s;hing coun|try, and the farce of friend&s;hip which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep up, in order to engage this coun|try in the war, for &s;ome time withheld the Con|vention from further depredations on our com|merce: but, being baffled in their war project by the treaty with Britain, and imagining (vainly I tru&s;t) that America would be terrified by their victories, and the con&s;equences the&s;e might pro|duce, they i&s;&s;ued on the 2d of July la&s;t, a decree for renewing their &s;poliations, and for &s;eizing all enemy's property on board of American ve&s;&s;els, which decree Citizen Adet communicated to the Secretary of State, and to the <HI>people,</HI> on the 27th of October.</P>
<P>The perfidy and tyranny of this conduct are nothing, when compared to the manner in which they are brazened out.&mdash;The Citizen fir&s;t &s;ends the Secretary of State a Note, enclo&s;ing the un|principled decree. The Secretary, in an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;es the unea&s;ine&s;s of the Pre&s;ident, at &s;uch a flagrant violation of the treaty. To this the Frenchman has the a&s;&s;urance to reply, that it is <Q><HI>the</HI> resolution <HI>of a government</HI> terrible to its
<PB N="53" REF="030226_0051_0FE54B5ECE89EC80">
enemies, <HI>but</HI> generous to its allies;</Q> and, as he el&s;ewhere calls the government of America the <HI>enemy</HI> of France, he menacingly leaves us to con|clude, that <HI>generosity</HI> is to be the portion of others, while <HI>dreadful cha&s;tisement</HI> is in re&s;erve for us.&mdash;We may pardon the threats of a &s;imple bully; we may even forgive a &s;harper or a robber, but when he has the impudence to ju&s;tify his conduct, and that too with his filthy fi&s;t at our mouths, there is no degree of re&s;entment, no mortal means of venge|ance, adequate to the in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Thus have I had patience to go through the mock charges, which the de&s;pots of France have dared to prefer again&s;t the free, equitable and beneficent government of America. I &s;hall take the liberty of adding a few mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;erva|tions, which would be di&s;pen&s;ed with, fearing the reader is already too much fatigued, did not the cri&s;is of affairs &s;eem to demand them now, or never.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that calls, and mo&s;t loudly calls, for reprobation, is, the contemptuous manner in which the Frenchman treated the government, by communicating his Notes <HI>to the people,</HI> at the &s;ame time, or before, they were received by the Pre|&s;ident.</P>
<P>The &s;ole right of making communications of this nature to the people of a &s;tate, &s;o evidently belongs to its government, and is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the very exi&s;tence of every government, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the fir&s;t violation of it &s;hould have been re&s;erved for the heatheni&s;h French. Former barbarians ever re&s;pected this

right: the laws of decency had &s;ome influence on their uncultivated minds; but the barbarians, or rather the &s;avages, of Paris, have &s;et tho&s;e and all other laws, human and divine, at defiance. They &s;eem to lock upon them&s;elves as the chil|dren of the devil, and to have a&s;&s;umed, in virtue of their father, the right of prowling about the earth, di&s;turbing the peace of mankind, by &s;cattering the &s;eeds of rebellion and blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>Their agents have long been practi&s;ing their fiend-like temptations on the people of this coun|try. They have proceeded from one degree of ma|lice to another, till at la&s;t their late Mini&s;ter Adet (for whom I wi&s;h I could find a name wor&s;e than his own) makes a direct attempt to inflame the peo|ple again&s;t the government.&mdash;After telling them, that the Convention has ordered their ve&s;&s;els to be &s;eized (contrary to treaty), he proceeds: <Q>And now, if the execution of the&s;e mea&s;ures <HI>gives ri&s;e to complaints</HI> in the United States, it is not again&s;t France they &s;hould be directed, but <HI>again&s;t those men,</HI> who have entered into nego|ciations contrary to the intere&s;ts of <HI>their coun|try.</HI></Q>&mdash;Ju&s;t as if he had &s;aid, pointing to the Pre&s;ident, the Senate and Officers of State: <Q>there they are; ri&s;e on them, cut their throats, and choo&s;e others more pliant to our will.</Q>&mdash; His words do not amount to this, 'tis true; but in his country a hint far le&s;s intelligible, would have been perfectly under&s;tood, and would not have failed of the de&s;ired effect. Happily he was not haranguing a Pari&s;ian mob. Whatever fooli&s;h partiality &s;ome of us may have had, and may yet have for France, nature has been &s;o kind as not to make us Frenchmen.</P>

This &s;tep, though it could not be looked upon as an appeal to the people, was &s;o much re&s;ented by the Queen, that &s;he ordered him to quit the kingdom immediately; and in this &s;he was &s;upported by the unanimous voice of the nation; who, notwith&s;tanding they di&s;approv|ed of a peace which was to &s;acrifice the great advantages obtained by their arms under the im|mortal Duke of Marlborough, ju&s;tly and manful|ly re&s;ented the attempt of a foreign mini&s;ter to &s;tep in between them and their own &s;overeign, however blameable her mea&s;ures might be.</P>
<P>And, &s;hall it be &s;aid of the people of America, that they are le&s;s attached to a government of their own choo&s;ing, and that has never for a moment lo&s;t &s;ight of their intere&s;ts? No; it would be un|ju&s;t to &s;ay this. The people are impatient of the in&s;ult, and their confidence in the wi&s;dom of their chief is the only thing that could keep them pa|cified.</P>

The flag was receiv|ed as a &s;ymbol of voluntary &s;ubjection, in&s;tead of independence; and, had I been Pre&s;ident, the Emba&s;&s;ador who dared to give colour to &s;uch an idea, &s;hould not have had it in his power to degrade his country a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have been curious to &s;ee the <HI>tender tears trickling</HI> from the eyes of Robe&s;pierre and the re&s;t of tho&s;e &s;anguinary villains, who were daily employed in butchering the human &s;pecies, <HI>tearing out their entrails, biting their hearts</HI> and

<HI>lapping their gore.</HI> They wept blood in&s;tead of brine, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>When you go home, Citizen Adet, to your "terrible nation," which I hope in God will be very &s;oon, I will &s;end, to tho&s;e of your weepers whom the ju&s;tice of heaven has not yet overtak|en, a copy of the <HI>Bloody Buoy:</HI> they will &s;ee &s;ome|thing there that has drawn tears from the eyes of <HI>Americans,</HI> and that has made too deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion on their hearts to be worn away even by the hand of time. This compendium of ty|ranny, brutality, ferociou&s;ne&s;s and infamy, is read by the ri&s;ing generation of America: it &s;inks into the memory as the plummet into the &s;tream, and, till the plummet &s;hall glide along the &s;ur|face like a feather, the name of <HI>French Republi|can</HI> will awaken the idea of all that is perfidious and bloody minded.</P>
<P>The trickling tears of the Convention, at the &s;ight of a bit of lin&s;y-wool&s;y, puts me in mind of Mark Anthony and his mob of blubbering ple|bians. "Kind &s;ouls!" &s;ays he, <Q>do you weep at the &s;ight of Cae&s;ar's <HI>garment</HI> only? What will you do then, when you &s;ee Cae&s;ar him&s;elf.</Q> Upon which he &s;hows them the corps, and the ra&s;cals, who would have knocked his brains out if he had not been dead, begin bellowing like &s;o many town bulls round a buxom heifer.&mdash;The Convention would not have acted this &s;illy part by America. If they could have got <HI>"Cae&s;ar him&s;elf"</HI> under their clutches, they would have completed the farce of the Croco|dile; dried up their tears and fell to cracking our bones.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030226_0058_0FE54B72244F70D0">Whether the French Convention did really cry, or whether the tears flowed, or rather trickled, from the leaky imagination of Citizen Adet, I know not; but this I know, that the reception of their flag produced ju&s;t a contrary effect here. What makes them weep, makes us laugh; and what makes them laugh makes us weep. Thank heaven, we are exactly their oppo&s;ite in every thing!</P>
<P>From <HI>French tenderne&s;s</HI> we naturally turn to <HI>Briti&s;h barbarity.</HI> They form a contra&s;t like the gem and the foil, and therefore the Citizen, who is at once a &s;tate&s;man and an orator, has, with great art and judgment, contrived to &s;queeze them clo&s;e together in the peroration of his Blun|derbu&s;s. "Alas!" &s;ays he, <Q>time has not yet demoli&s;hed the fortifications with which the Engli&s;h roughened this country&mdash;nor tho&s;e the Americans rai&s;ed for their defence; their half rounded &s;ummits &s;till appear in every quarter, <HI>amid&s;t plains on the tops of mountains.</HI> The traveller need not &s;earch for the ditch which &s;erved to encompa&s;s them; it is &s;till open under his feet. Scattered ruins of hou&s;es laid wa&s;te, which the fire had partly re&s;pected, in order to leave monuments of Briti&s;h fury, are &s;till to be found.&mdash;Men &s;till exi&s;t, who can &s;ay, here a ferocious Engli&s;hman &s;laughtered my father; there my wife tore her <HI>bleeding daughter</HI> from the hands of <HI>an unbridled Engli&s;hman.</HI> Alas! the &s;oldiers who fell under the &s;word of the Britons are not yet reduced to du&s;t; the la|bourer, in turning up his field, &s;till draws from the bo&s;om of the earth their whitened bones; while the ploughman, with tears of tenderne&s;s and gratitude, &s;till recollects that his fields,

now covered with rich harve&s;ts, have been <HI>moi&s;tened with French blood;</HI> while every thing around the inhabitants of this country animates them to &s;peak of the <HI>tyranny of Great Britain</HI> and of the <HI>generosity of Frenchmen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I have till now avoided quotations as much as po&s;&s;ible; but I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation to cull this faire&s;t flower of the diplomatic po&s;ey. Some imaginations are &s;aid to ru&s;h forward like a flood, others to flow like a &s;tream, and others to glide like a current; but poor Citizen Adet's nei|ther ru&s;hes, flows, nor glides: it trickles, like the eyes of his ma&s;ters; it drains, it dribbles, it drops.&mdash;Dear Citizen, if you love me (of which I much doubt, by the bye), never again employ your eloquence to rou&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions; for it lays them as completely as the cold hand of death. In&s;tead of inflaming, you freeze us: in&s;tead of fire-brands, you turn us into icicles.&mdash;No; when you wi&s;h to excite the vengeful feelings; keep to your in&s;olence; that is your fort; there your talents will ever en&s;ure you the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as they have done on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And were you &s;o vain, &s;o completely the French|man, as to imagine, that this ta&s;tele&s;s, turgid, hy|perbolical non&s;en&s;e of yours, would make the people of America believe, that <HI>ferocity</HI> is the characteri&s;tic of Britons? A little reflection might have told you that your malignant endeavours would be in vain. Two-thirds of the inhabitants of the&s;e States are of Briti&s;h de&s;cent: they know that the a&s;hes of their forefathers &s;leep in the i&s;land of Britain. They know al&s;o, that only twenty years ago they were ju&s;tly proud of being called Britons
<PB N="62" REF="030226_0060_0FE54B7AAA87BDB8">
them&s;elves; and though a political revolution has rendered that name no longer proper, they know that no revolution has taken place in their nati|onal character. To charge the Briti&s;h character with ferocity then, is &s;aying to the Americans: <Q>I do not call you a &s;et of ferocious ra&s;cals; but you are of a d&mdash;d ferocious breed.</Q></P>
<P>To retaliate here would be &s;uperfluous; for the ferocity of the French is now acknowledged by them&s;elves even. But, when I hear a man talk about <HI>whitened bones,</HI> and a&s;&s;ert that <Q>every thing ani|mates the inhabitants of this country to &s;peak of the <HI>tyranny of Britain</HI> and the <HI>generosity of Frenchmen,</HI></Q> I am naturally led to look back to the cruel and &s;avage war, which the&s;e <HI>gener|ous Frenchmen</HI> carried on again&s;t <HI>the inhabitants of this country,</HI> and in which they would have &s;ucceeded in exterminating the whole of them, had it not been for the protecting <Q>tyranny of Britain.</Q></P>
<P>In the charge of ferocity which Citizen Adet has brought again&s;t the Briti&s;h, he contents him|&s;elf with a flouri&s;h of mere hyperbole, as de&s;ti|tute of novelty and elegance as it nece&s;&s;arily is of truth. He has attempted to produce not a &s;in|gle fact in &s;upport of his &s;lander, and for this be&s;t of rea&s;ons, becau&s;e he knew no &s;uch fact was to be found. I &s;hall proceed in a different manner. I &s;hall give &s;uch damning proof of the <HI>ge|nerosity of Frenchmen</HI> towards the people of America as will leave no room for denial.</P>
<P>During the &s;avage war of 1757, above alluded to, when the French had formed a chain of po&s;ts
<PB N="63" REF="030226_0061_0FE54B7C6AD85688">
&s;tretching from the Bay of Funday to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi, with the intention of &s;ubjugating the&s;e &s;tates or el&s;e driving the people into the &s;ea, they took &s;everal forts, and, for a long time, had pretty general &s;ucce&s;s: what u&s;e they made of it, how <HI>generous</HI> they were, will appear from the following account of their capture of <HI>Fort Wil|liam-Henry.</HI> I am not about to repeat a vague report. I am not even appealing to the hi&s;tory of England, or the writings of Engli&s;hmen. I am going to copy what was &s;aid, written and printed, by Americans them&s;elves. I could ap|ply to many American publications of the time; but I choo&s;e, for many rea&s;ons, to draw this proof of the <HI>"generosity of Frenchmen,"</HI> from <HI>Doctor Franklin</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In his paper, publi&s;hed at Philadelphia on the 25th of Augu&s;t, 1757, after &s;aying that the fort &s;urrendered by capitulation, with leave to march out with the honours of war, he proceeds thus: <Q>The <HI>French</HI> immediately after the capitulation, <HI>mo&s;t perfidiou&s;ly</HI> let their bloodhounds loo&s;e up|on our people. Some got off, the re&s;t were &s;trip|ped &s;tark naked; many were killed and &s;calp|ed, officers not excepted. The throats of the women were cut, their <HI>bellies ripped open,</HI> their <HI>bowels turned out,</HI> and <HI>thrown upon the faces of their yet palpitating bodies.</HI> The children were taken by the heels, and <HI>their brains beat out again&s;t the trees or &s;tones,</HI> and not one of them &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor then ob&s;erves, that this <HI>cruelty of the French</HI> is nothing new; for that, <Q>they ma&s;&s;a|cred &s;everal hundreds of General Braddock's
<PB N="64" REF="030226_0062_0FE54B7E00BF3538">
<HI>wounded men,</HI> that they murdered their <HI>pri&s;on|ers</HI> near Ticonderoga, and all the <HI>&s;ick</HI> and <HI>wounded</HI> of the garri&s;on of O&s;wego, <HI>notwith|&s;tanding the previous capitulation.</HI></Q> He con|cludes thus: <Q>To what a pitch of <HI>perfidy and cruelty is the French nation arrived!</HI> Would not an ancient beathen &s;hudder with horror on hearing &s;o hideous a tale. Could the mo&s;t &s;a|vage nations ever exceed &s;uch <HI>French barbari|ty? It is hard for an Engli&s;hman</HI> to kill his enemy that lies at his feet, begging his life; but will not our armed men in future be obliged to refu&s;e all quarter? <HI>Con&s;ider of it my country|men; take advice, and &s;peak your minds</HI></Q>&mdash;In another place the Doctor exclaims, <Q><HI>The Lord knows what</HI> French treachery <HI>will do.</HI> When &s;hall we have revenge!</Q></P>
<P>I do not know Citizen Adet's per&s;on, I cannot therefore tell whether his cheeks be covered with buff or not. From his notes, I &s;hould rather &s;up|po&s;e they are; but if they are not, he mu&s;t blu&s;h him&s;elf to death upon comparing the Old Doctor's account of <HI>French genero&s;ity</HI> with his own.&mdash;He will &s;ay, perhaps, that it was the French <HI>king,</HI> and not <HI>the nation,</HI> that the&s;e cruelties mu&s;t be attributed to. Well then, it is the <HI>king</HI> and not <HI>the nation,</HI> that the aid this country received la&s;t war mu&s;t be attributed to. In both in&s;tances, the king was the director and his people the actors; with this remarkable di&s;tinction, that, it is cer|tain the troops that came to America were always &s;ent by him, while it is not certain that he ever ordered them to turn human butchers when they got here.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="030226_0063_0FE54B8030310D28">Let us now take a view of <Q>the <HI>generosity</HI> of Frenchmen,</Q> towards America, from the bloody times above mentioned to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>When, by the united valour and per&s;evarance of America and Britain, they were driven from this continent, they laid in watch, as the devil is &s;aid to do when he &s;ees a happy couple, for an opportunity of effecting a &s;eparation between the two countries. With this opportunity the folly of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration &s;oon furni&s;hed them. Yet they at fir&s;t he&s;itated whether the indepen|dence of this country would be advantageous to them or not: but, revenge, and that great object of their policy, the humbling of their rival, at la&s;t got the better; and the alliance with the United States was concluded on. This &s;tep, how|ever, did not take place till after the Congre&s;s had i&s;&s;ued their Declaration of Independence, and even after tho&s;e victories were obtained, which gave the deci&s;ive blow to the Briti&s;h power in America.&mdash;Some of their troops landed here; but what did they do? Citizen Adet tells us about <HI>"fields moi&s;tened with French blood,"</HI> and &s;ays, that <HI>"the ploughman now &s;heds tears of tenderne&s;s,"</HI> when he is turning them up. This is as &s;illy as the talk of the mad wench in one of Gay's farces, when &s;he exclaims: <Q>O, dear delightful &s;treams of cream! Rivers of milk and &s;eas of honey!</Q>&mdash; French blood! I would be glad to know how it was &s;pilt, unle&s;s they poked &s;pear-gra&s;s up their no&s;es, like Sir John Fal&s;taff and his bullies. They did nothing here. They were never engaged. They only &s;eemed to come to look on a bit, and go home and brag about <HI>giving liberty to America.</HI> Their fleets were out, to be &s;ure; but they were
<PB N="66" REF="030226_0064_0FE54B8752E3D0C0">
fighting (or rather running away) for France and not for America. Taking Briti&s;h I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies was ju&s;t as &s;erviceable to this country then, as robbing the pea&s;ants of Germany now is.&mdash;So much for their war-like <HI>genero&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>As their object in making war had been to weaken Great Britain, and not to render this country free and independent, &s;o, when the terms of peace came to be propo&s;ed, they &s;oon made it appear, that they wi&s;hed to <HI>transfer the dependence</HI> from Britain to them&s;elves. To this end they at|tempted to exclude America from the fi&s;heries on one &s;ide, and from the We&s;tern countries on the other. This would have at all times expo&s;ed the States to the power of the Briti&s;h, and the na|tural con&s;equence would have been, a continual dependence on France. It was owing to Me&s;&s;rs. John Adams and Jay that this was not effected, and this is the rea&s;on why they are now &s;o hated and abu&s;ed by the French faction.&mdash;There's <HI>gene|ro&s;ity</HI> for you!</P>
<P>Thus far went the <HI>insidious</HI> friend&s;hip of the old government: that of the mock republic has been a thou&s;and times wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they &s;ent Genet to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in the country; but finding that he had failed, they pretended to recal him; leaving him here, how|ever, to in&s;ult the government. Now they even ju&s;tify all that he did, and complain of the treat|ment he received.</P>
<P>Fauchet we find dabbling in the We&s;tern re|bellion, and writing home to the Convention, his
<PB N="67" REF="030226_0065_0FE54B8904197BF8">
regret that it had been quelled, and his fear that it might tend to con&s;olidate the government. Can any man be fool enough to imagine, that Fauchet would have written in this manner, had he not been well a&s;&s;ured, that the Convention thought like him&s;elf?</P>
<P>If any one doubted of this before, he can now doubt no longer. Adet has thrown off the ma&s;k for them. They repealed their fir&s;t decree for &s;eizing American ve&s;&s;els; they pretended to be &s;orry for the in&s;olence of Genet; but now they repeat their decree, and make that very appeal to the people, which they di&s;placed Genet for talking about! <HI>Generous</HI> fellows!&mdash;Who would have thought, while they were weeping over our flag, and &s;ending theirs to be wept over here, and writing love letters to the Congre&s;s, and &s;ending us their new plan for <HI>weighing</HI> bread and butter <HI>by sines and tangents.</HI> Lord cur&s;e them! Who would have thought, I &s;ay, while all this loving mummery was going forward; while they were hugging and &s;queezing, and &s;lavering over with &s;nuff and foam, their dear "American brethren;" who would have thought that no le&s;s than <HI>seven</HI> heads of accu&s;ation lay rankling in their bo&s;oms! &mdash;"A <HI>friend,</HI>" &s;ays Citizen Adet, <Q>injured by a <HI>friend,</HI> may &s;afely complain, without fear of giving offence.</Q>&mdash;Yes; but then he mu&s;t com|plain <HI>like a friend,</HI> and not like a bully. He mu&s;t not talk of his hor&s;ewhip or his cane. He mu&s;t not come with <HI>terror</HI> in his mouth; or friend&s;hip takes its flight, and re&s;entment &s;ucceeds. Be&s;ides, "a friend injured by a friend," complains at once: he does not trea&s;ure up the injury in his mind, and re&s;erve it for the day of his &s;trength.
<PB N="68" REF="030226_0066_0FE54B8A934011F0">
He does not hug, and ki&s;s, and hang on the neck of his friend, and weep for joy at the &s;ight of his <HI>garment;</HI> he does not keep up this farce for four long years, and at la&s;t, when he &s;ees that hypo|cri&s;y avails him nothing, come and rip up his grievances, and threaten vengeance. This is not the conduct of <HI>an injured friend,</HI> but that of <Q>an in&s;idious d&mdash;d Iago,</Q> as Peter Pindar calls the French; and &s;uch they have been, and will be, to this and every other country, that has the fol|ly to place any dependence in their friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Their audacious interference, too, in the elec|tion of a chief magi&s;trate for this country, is an|other mark of their <HI>generosity,</HI> their tender care of us. "Let your government <HI>return to itself,</HI>" &s;ays the Citizen, <Q>and the <HI>Directory</HI> will <HI>temper</HI> the effects of its <HI>resentment.</HI></Q>&mdash;I wonder what &s;ort of fellows this <HI>Directory,</HI> as they call it, is compo&s;ed of: whether they are &s;haped like gods or devils, or what they are like, that they &s;hould dare to talk in this manner to an independent na|tion, that they have no more power over than they have over heaven. What a poor beggarly puff, for a man as much fit to be a Pre&s;ident as I am to be an Archbi&s;hop! A man who is a de|i&s;t by profe&s;&s;ion, a philo&s;opher by trade, and a Frenchman in politics and morality: a man who has written a pa&s;&s;port for Tom Paine's <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and would, if nece&s;&s;ary, write another for his infamous letter to General Wa&s;hington: a man, in &s;hort, who is at the head of the pro&s;tituted party by who&s;e intrigues he has been brought forward and is &s;upported. If this man is elected Pre&s;ident, the country is &s;old to the French; and as plantations are generally
<PB N="69" REF="030226_0067_0FE54B8CAFFCD9E0">
&s;old with the live &s;tock on them. I &s;hall remove my carca&s;s; for I am re&s;olved never to become their property. I do not wi&s;h my family vault to be in the guts of cannibals.</P>
<P>Paine's Letter to General Wa&s;hington is the la&s;t pretty little proof of French <HI>generosity.</HI> I have no room here to &s;ay any thing as to the con|tents of this &s;uperlatively in&s;olent and infamous performance; but it is clear that the old ruffian has been ordered to write it by the Convention. It was written nearly about the &s;ame time that the decree for &s;eizing American ve&s;&s;els was pa&s;&s;ed; it was expected that Adet's communications would &s;tir up the people, and the&s;e &s;weepings of Tom's brain were intended to fini&s;h the work: nor have I the lea&s;t doubt but they are now enjoying the hope, that General Wa&s;hington's head is kicking about the &s;treets of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Such has been "the <HI>generosity of Frenchmen</HI>" towards the people of America. From the con|tinuation of this genero&s;ity I think we have little to hope, and I am certain we &s;hall find that we have as little to fear from their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute between the two countries &s;tands thus: France has violated the treaty, and impu|dently in&s;i&s;ts, that &s;he will continue in the vio|lation of it, at the &s;ame time that her mini&s;ter fir&s;t in&s;ults the government, and then declares him|&s;elf &s;u&s;pended, <Q>till the government returns to it&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;What then is to be done? Statues and curio&s;ities we have none to &s;top their mouths with; unle&s;s, indeed, it be the Statue from over the library door. We might al&s;o &s;pare them Mr. Jef|fer&s;on's
<PB N="70" REF="030226_0068_0FE54B92A6758138">
pivot-chair and his great bull Mammoth; to which they might add Mr. Jeffer&s;on him&s;elf, for it does not appear that he will be wanted on this &s;ide the water. But this would not &s;atisfy them. What is to be done, then? Is the govern|ment to <HI>return to itself,</HI> beg pardon of the <Q>ter|rible nation</Q> for having i&s;&s;ued a proclamation of neutrality; for having declined a treaty with them, and for having formed one with Great Britain? Is this to be the conduct of America, who&s;e chief boa&s;t is her <HI>independence?</HI> Is &s;he to become a poor little twinkling &s;tar that is to hide its head at the rays of the <HI>Grande Republique Fran&ccedil;oise?</HI> Is &s;he at la&s;t to be governed by a gang of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins with their long couteau at her throat? A pretty kind of <HI>independence</HI> truly! If this is to be the ca&s;e, &s;he has changed a Briti&s;h parent for a French ma&s;ter: from a child in leading &s;trings &s;he has become a grown up &s;lave in chains.</P>
<P>But this will not be the ca&s;e. This government will in&s;i&s;t upon the fulfilment of the treaty, or will declare it null and void for ever. They will no longer &s;uffer the country to be tantalized with decrees and revocations and &s;u&s;pen&s;ions and threats. They will &s;ay; <Q>Do us ju&s;tice and leave us to manage our own affairs, or we have done with you;</Q> and in this they will be &s;upported by the voice of the people, however Citizen Adet may flatter him&s;elf to the contrary.</P>
<P>The <HI>terrible tone</HI> was the wor&s;t that the Guillo|tine Legi&s;lators could have a&s;&s;umed here. It may do well enough with the Braban&s;ons, the Dutch, the Savoyards and the Italians; but it will never do with Americans, who of all mankind are the la&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="030226_0069_0FE5470E24FEFE38">
to yield to compul&s;ion. The quarrel with Great Britain which finally brought about the indepen|dence of this country, was merely about the word <HI>force.</HI> The colonies were willing to <HI>give</HI> the amount of the taxes impo&s;ed, but they would not &s;uffer it to be &s;aid that they were <HI>forced to do it.</HI> When I was a little boy, my elder brother, in order to get my &s;hare of the apple pudding, u&s;ed to &s;ay: "PETER, I <HI>order</HI> you to eat."&mdash;That very in&s;tant my jaws refu&s;ed their functions, and the mor&s;el &s;tuck in my throat. To be &s;ure I was a mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate dog, and I am inclined to think that the Moun&s;eers will find their dear little Mi&s;s America to be much about of the &s;ame temper. The peo|ple of this country are the de&s;cendants of Bri|tons and Germans, and they are made of the &s;ame &s;tubborn kind of &s;tuff as their ance&s;tors. With good words you may lead them far, but with bad ones not a &s;ingle &s;tep: to their humani|ty you may always appeal with a&s;&s;urance of &s;uc|ce&s;s, but never to their fears: like the oak they may be cru&s;hed and &s;hivered to &s;plinters, but no mortal power will ever make them bend.</P>
<P>Some people imagine that France will declare war again&s;t us. France dares do no &s;uch thing. France knows better. No; the mo&s;t &s;he will do, is, to per&s;evere in the violation of the treaty, and con&s;equently <HI>break off all connection with the Unit|ed States;</HI> and this is ju&s;t what is wanted. Then we &s;hould get rid of the council of old ones and the council of young ones and the five &s;overeigns, that are born and expire in rotation, and Citizen Genet and Citizen Adet, and all the Faro bank and billiard table men, and all the dingy off|&s;pring of French delicacy, and, which will be

the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, we &s;hall get rid of the mon|&s;trous unnatural faction that they keep alive to goad, torment, and weaken the government, and divide the country again&s;t it&s;elf. Would they but break off from us, we &s;hould avoid that de|gradation of manners, which their impious &s;y&s;|tem mu&s;t inevitably produce, wherever it gains ground to any extent. Their diabolical agents are now &s;eeking for pro&s;elytes in every &s;tate and town&s;hip of the Union. I believe that Bache's athei&s;tical Calendar is paid for by the French, as much as I believe that Paine's Age of Rea&s;on was. They both come from the &s;ame pre&s;s, and are intended to an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and that purpo&s;e is, to corrupt the hearts of the people, make them emulate the French in every thing that is vile and &s;avage; to de&s;troy the govern|ment, and throw the country into the power of France. There is much more to be apprehended here than from their direct threats. Their wild and bla&s;phemous doctrines will have little effect on people of &s;en&s;e; but they may have, and they will have, as they already have had, on igno|rance and youth. Youth is ever caught with no|velty, and ambitious of &s;uperior di&s;cernment. The panders of Paris have always addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to this part of &s;ociety: they &s;ucceeded complete|ly in France, and I am much afraid their &s;ucce&s;s has been but too promi&s;ing here. The &s;ooner, there|fore, the country is purged of them, the better. Every year, every month, every day, they be|come more dangerous. Let them then go. A war, generally termed the &s;courge of nations, is a ble&s;&s;ing, when compared with what we have to expect from their di&s;organizing impious princi|ciples and perfidious intrigues.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="030226_0071_0FE54B980EF281F0">But, no declaration of war will come from them. They know better than to relinqui&s;h their hold. They will &s;tick to us like a burr. They can be as haughty as Lucifer, and they can be as mean. When they cannot with maje&s;tic &s;tature &s;cale the walls of Paradi&s;e, they can &s;hrink them|&s;elves into the &s;hape of a toad, and creep in at a chink. When they perceive, that we are not to be &s;cared, that we laugh at their <HI>"terrible nation"</HI> and their <HI>"tempered re&s;entment,"</HI> they will be|come as mild as milk-maids, and &s;ay they <HI>were only joking.</HI> They will repeal their <HI>decree</HI> for &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els; they will pretend <HI>to cry</HI> again, and their Citizen will tell us about their <Q><HI>&s;weet</HI> &s;entiments,</Q> and we &s;hall have another flag &s;ent, and &s;o all will be made up.&mdash;The reader who con&s;ults only his own heart will &s;ay that this is impo&s;&s;ible; but let him recollect whom we have to deal with: the French Convention; men who make a &s;port of the violation of treaties and of oaths; who have bani&s;hed every idea of &s;hame and remor&s;e, and according to who&s;e &s;tandard of retrograde refinement, meanne&s;s is commen&s;urate with weakne&s;s and misfortune, and in&s;olence with power and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>However, though I am certain that the French will not go to war with America, I am as certain that America mu&s;t &s;oon go to war with them.&mdash;Let not the reader &s;tart. He mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf to think and to talk on the &s;ubject, and the &s;ooner he begins the better. I am not foretelling the day of judgment nor a &s;econd deluge; but am &s;peaking of an object that may be looked at with calmne&s;s, as I make no doubt it will be en|countered with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="030226_0072_0FE54B9CF8766FF0">There is every rea&s;on to believe, indeed, with me the fact is certain, that Spain has ceded Loui&s;iana to France. This will put the French in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all our We&s;tern Frontier, give them the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and then I beg any one to ca&s;t his eye over the map of the United States, and &s;ee the expo&s;ed &s;itua|tion in which they will be placed.</P>
<P>France has had this in contemplation ever &s;ince the peace of 1783, and the Spani&s;h part of Saint Domingo, lately ceded to her, and with which &s;he can do nothing, now furni&s;hes her with an object of exchange. Be&s;ides, the king of Spain can refu&s;e the French nothing, or he cer|tainly would not have entered into a league with the murderers of the head of his family, and have &s;upplied athei&s;ts with troops to carry on a marauding war on the Catholic States of Italy and the defencele&s;s head of the church.</P>
<P>The French, once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Loui&s;iana, will give law to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and when we con&s;ider the prevalent &s;pirit and politics of the We&s;tern people in general, the di&s;tance they are at from the &s;eat of government, and the &s;educ|tive arts of their new neighbours, there is little rea&s;on to hope, that they will long remain obedi|ent to the United States. The new inhabitants of Loui&s;iana will be made up of the profligate French &s;oldiery, who will be prevailed on by &s;plendid promi&s;es to tran&s;port them&s;elves to this country, but who will be fit for nothing but pillage and war.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="030226_0073_0FE54B9EC6F96A68">With &s;uch a hold on the back countries, and &s;uch a party in the Atlantic ones as they now have, a divi&s;ion of the Union mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence. The &s;outhern States, where very little of that independence of &s;pirit prevails, which re&s;i&s;ts the encroachments of an ambitious foe, will &s;oon become an appendage to France. The mid|dle and northern States may, at the expen&s;e of bloody wars, pre&s;erve their independence for a while; but, at la&s;t, harra&s;&s;ed, and fatigued with the burden of defending them&s;elves, they will call in the aid of Great Britain; and thus the ba&s;is of an empire will once more be cut out into colonies and provinces.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who rely on the friendly profe&s;&s;ions of the French, I refer to the in&s;tances of their friend|&s;hip which we have witne&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations. Let any one read the inter|cepted letter of Fauchet, and recollect that it was written in confidence to the government, and doubt, if he can, that the counties then in a &s;tate of in&s;urrection would have been &s;upported by France, if &s;he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ter|ritory &s;he is now about to acquire. Such opportuni|ties will continually offer, as long as faction exi&s;ts, and that it ever will do, as long as there is any thing to contend for. To judge of the future by the pre&s;ent tranquillity, is to pre&s;ume that the billows have cea&s;ed to roll, becau&s;e we &s;ee the &s;ea in a calm.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the peace of 1783, France has be|held the commerce, carried on between America and Great Britain, with a watchful, jealous and envious eye. At fir&s;t &s;he endeavoured to turn
<PB N="76" REF="030226_0074_0FE54BA054698E30">
the channel towards her&s;elf; but that having failed, &s;he fell on the plan of &s;ubjugation. A French writer in treating of this &s;ubject ob&s;erves, that <Q>it would be a balance again&s;t the <HI>loans</HI> of England to the <HI>Atlantic merchants.</HI></Q> By <HI>loans</HI> he means the <HI>credit</HI> given by the Briti&s;h merchants, and which is indeed a mine of gold to the farm|ers and merchants of America. There is &s;ome|thing really diabolical in this envy. They would &s;ooner the country &s;hould be torn to pieces than it &s;hould trade with their rival.</P>
<P>They well know, that there is but one check to their ambitious projects; and that is, an alli|ance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive between Great Bri|tain and America. They know, that by &s;uch an alliance they would be deprived of all their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t Indies, and would be exclud|ed from the Atlantic &s;eas. This alliance once formed, America might forbid them to &s;et a foot in Loui&s;iana, or might drive them and their <Q><HI>na|tural</HI> allies,</Q> the Spaniards, into the Gulph of Mexico. It is with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this on their minds, that they have been &s;o &s;edulous in forming a faction to oppo&s;e every accommodating &s;tep, and every advance towards friend&s;hip, be|tween the two countries. They have the Machi|avellian maxim, "divide and you govern," con|tinually in their eye. They wi&s;h to keep them a&s;&s;under, that they may devour them one at a time.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance at pre&s;ent, is, this ce&s;&s;ion of Loui&s;iana will not be perfectly a&s;certained, till after the general peace; &s;o that, though Great Britain is nearly as much intere&s;ted
<PB N="77" REF="030226_0075_0FE54BA2776ADFD8">
in the event as America, &s;he can take no &s;teps to prevent it, becau&s;e &s;he will be di&s;armed before it be known; and their Myrmidons will be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their promi&s;ed land, before any mea&s;ures of prevention can be adopted on the part of America. Something, however, mu&s;t be done to pre&s;erve us from &s;uch neighbours, or the independence of this country will go to the grave before us. National precautions mu&s;t be left to the rulers of the &s;tate, but every man has it in his power to contribute towards the di&s;courage|ment of faction, that, at any rate, though there &s;hould be an enemy on the frontiers, there may be none in the heart of the country.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation of America with re&s;pect to the in&s;idious, unprincipled, in&s;olent and per|fidious Republic of France; and it only remains for the virtue and public &s;pirit of the people to determine, what &s;ort of an&s;wer ought to be given to her pre&s;umptuous and domineering mini&s;ter. Let it be well remembered, that the Notes, con|taining his calumnious accu&s;ations, his contemptu|ous defiance and hectoring threats, are not the effu&s;ions of a paragraphi&s;t or a pamphleteer: they are the official communications of a public mini&s;ter, thrown in the teeth of the nation. In le&s;s than two months they will be read and com|mented on by half the civilized world. Tho&s;e who know the American character will not be deceived; but far the greater part, will &s;et us down as a nation of &s;harpers or poltroons, who have either not hone&s;ty to &s;upport our reputati|on, or not courage to defend it. If there be a man, who, with this reflection on his mind, can wi&s;h the government to &s;toop and cringe and &s;ue

and beg for peace, to court a repetition of the buffet that yet tingles in our cheek, he may boa&s;t about <HI>independence,</HI> he may even call him&s;elf a <HI>patriot;</HI> but his independence is an empty &s;ound, and he knows no more of the animating glow of patrioti&s;m, where affection, duty and honour unite, than the &s;lave knows of the charms of li|berty or the eunuch of the &s;weets of love.&mdash;No; the an&s;wer of every man, who loves his country and feels the in&s;ult it has received, yet prefers the ble&s;&s;ings of honourable peace to the ine|vitable calamities of war, is, in the words of a good old Engli&s;h king that conquered France and all that France contained:
<Q><L>"The &s;um of all our an&s;wer is but this:</L>
<L>"We would not &s;eek a battle as we are;</L>
<L>"Yet, as we are, we &s;ay we will not &s;hun it:</L>
