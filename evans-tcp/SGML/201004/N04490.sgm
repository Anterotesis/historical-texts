<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid and Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Here pre&s;ent you with a little Treati&s;e, which I mu&s;t expect will make the World angry with me, becau&s;e it is contrary to the World's Religion</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible I ought rather to die, than, for my <HI>own Will,</HI> to get the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the meane&s;t Per&s;on in the World: And Satan &s;ometimes tells me, <HI>he</HI> can put me in to a fine Way, whereby I may do God much Service, and yet keep in with the World, &s;leep in a whole Skin, and go to Heaven in a Feather-bed. His Way which he would have me take, is to keep a <HI>Medium</HI> between tho&s;e who have <HI>no Zeal,</HI> and tho&s;e who are <HI>zealous:</HI> And when he hath flatter'd away my <HI>Zeal for the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> he per&s;uades me, (as he doth <HI>&s;ome</HI> others) that I have made a <HI>great Progre&s;s</HI> in Religion, and have <HI>now</HI> the <HI>Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t:</HI> As if the <HI>Lion</HI> and the <HI>Lamb,</HI> could not <HI>lie down together</HI> in the &s;ame Soul.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner doth God give me to look into Eternity, and to realize, that the Things of this little World are not to be de&s;ired to make one happy; but I &s;ee that this <HI>&s;weet</HI> Reli|gion (as the World calls it, and which never <HI>poy&s;ons</HI> a Man's Soul, but when the World is <HI>&s;weet</HI> to him) is only <HI>Satan tran&s;|form'd into an Angel of Light;</HI> the <HI>cloven Foot</HI> appears quite plain: And I can &s;ay, from the Bottom of my Heart, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan; thou art an Offence unto me;</HI> thou <HI>&s;a|voure&s;t not the Things that be of God,</HI> but the Things that be <HI>of Men.</HI> Nay, I had rather be exercis'd with Pain, Sickne&s;s, Poverty, Reproach, and all other Evils God &s;ees to be <HI>whole&s;om</HI> for me, than have my Soul langui&s;h under that <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> Di&s;temper.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005568_0003_10186A5DC5601170">
For then, the worldly Mi&s;t being remov'd, I &s;ee plainly that the World hates Chri&s;t's Religion <HI>now,</HI> as mortally, as it ever hated <HI>him;</HI> that (as <HI>Luther</HI> &s;aith) <Q>'tis not the Go&s;pel Men preach, if it is preach'd in Peace; and that who&s;oever will be a faithful Preacher of the glorious Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> (as <HI>he</HI> hath foretold) have the World for an Enemy, and live in the Wars all the Days of his Life.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, did I call that preaching the Go&s;pel, which com|monly pa&s;&s;eth for it, viz. Mini&s;ters telling poor Sinners they mu&s;t believe Je&s;us Chri&s;t to <HI>be an all &s;ufficient Saviour of Sinners in general, but not their Saviour in particular;</HI> I &s;hould be of another Sentiment: For the World doth not <HI>hate,</HI> but <HI>love</HI> this Religion; 'tis the Religion of <HI>Nature;</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>Nature</HI> is not puzzled with it; all the Mini&s;ters Hearers have got <HI>&s;omething</HI> of it already; or, however it appears an ea&s;y Thing to get <HI>dark</HI> Religion at any Time: So that Mini&s;ters will be more likely to be <HI>deify'd</HI> than <HI>per&s;ecuted</HI> by the World for preached <HI>this</HI> Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But ina&s;much as <HI>I have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t;</HI> ina&s;much as I believe <HI>this</HI> to be <HI>another Go&s;pel;</HI> it is mo&s;t clear to me that tho&s;e who <HI>plainly</HI> and <HI>powerfully</HI> preach down <HI>this</HI> Faith, &s;o agreeable to Nature, and in lieu of it preach that (as holy <HI>Tin|dall</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it) "every Sinner mu&s;t believe Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour and <HI>his</HI> Redeemer, will meet with Per&s;ecution, in &s;ome Degree, and that not only from the prophane and de|bauch'd Part of the World, but al&s;o and e&s;pecially from many moral Per&s;ons without Grace: (For the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were the wor&s;t Enemies Chri&s;t had) and it may be, &s;ometimes from tru|ly gracious Per&s;ons, who have been enticed over into the En|emy's Camp. The World's Enmity again&s;t <HI>this</HI> Go&s;pel, a|gain&s;t <HI>this</HI> Faith, &s;prings directly from its Enmity again&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For the World hath &s;uch an <HI>high</HI> Opinion of its <HI>own</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;uch a <HI>mean</HI> Opinion of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that it will not bear <HI>Man</HI> to be &s;o much <HI>deba|&s;ed,</HI> and Chri&s;t to be &s;o much <HI>exalted,</HI> as that a poor Sinner, who knows he de&s;erves to be &s;ent to Hell, &s;hould <HI>this Moment</HI> believe that God for Chri&s;t's Sake <HI>doth</HI> forgive <HI>his</HI> Sins, and that Chri&s;t and all his Benefits belong to <HI>him</HI> notwith&s;tanding all his Vilene&s;s. This is the <HI>Root of Bitterne&s;s;</HI> Hence it is that the Doctrine of a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith is &s;o <HI>run down,</HI> becau&s;e it <HI>exalts</HI> the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> becau&s;e it makes
<PB N="5" REF="005568_0004_10186A60251CA028"><HI>Man</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be <HI>nothing,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be <HI>all in all;</HI> it not being &s;uch Divinity as can be well dige&s;ted, by tho&s;e who have never &s;een the <HI>Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or, if they have &s;een it, are <HI>now</HI> groping <HI>in the Dark,</HI> and <HI>&s;eeking to be ju&s;tified as it were, by the Works of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>This is the View in which the Thing appears to me: In Proportion therefore, as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> appears to me to be a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, my <HI>Heart always burns within me,</HI> with Zeal again&s;t <HI>that</HI> Religion which makes him a <HI>little</HI> Saviour. Nay, &s;ome|times when I a&s;cribe <HI>Glory to the Lamb</HI> in my Heart, and <HI>lift him up</HI> in my very Soul, it &s;eems that if I had as many Lives as Hairs on my Head, I could willingly and chearfully part with them all, rather than <HI>come into their Secret,</HI> who are for bani&s;hing a <HI>particular</HI> Faith out of the World, and thereby <HI>pulling down</HI> the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>trampling</HI> him under their Feet.</P>
<P>And, 'tis becau&s;e <HI>God who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love wherewith he loved me, when I was dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and in Sins,</HI> hath <HI>quickned</HI> me by making me to know that Chri&s;t is <HI>mighty to &s;ave,</HI> that I have undertaken, and, at Length fi|ni&s;hed the en&s;uing Treati&s;e; the great De&s;ign of which (<HI>he</HI> knows) is to &s;peak a good Word for the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and to &s;et the Crown upon <HI>his</HI> Head, when &s;o many are going Traiterou&s;ly to rob him of it, and to place it upon the Head of <HI>Rebellious Man.</HI></P>
<P>And as I know that <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> for the Honour of <HI>Zion's King,</HI> hath made me <HI>bold in my God,</HI> to draw my Pen in <HI>his</HI> Cau&s;e, and to maintain <HI>his</HI> Right, notwith&s;tanding a great <HI>Ho&s;t</HI> of <HI>Terrors</HI> that were &s;et <HI>in Array</HI> again&s;t me; &s;o I am per&s;uaded, <HI>my God who &s;tood by me, and &s;trengthened me</HI> to go through the Work, will ble&s;s it now it is done, to the <HI>prai&s;e of the Glory of his Grace:</HI> Nay, I <HI>can't</HI> doubt but it will redound more to his Glory than any Work I have been enabled to do <HI>by</HI> him, and <HI>for</HI> him, ever &s;ince I <HI>knew the Grace of God in Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Here, I expect it will be &s;aid by <HI>&s;ome,</HI> <Q>For <HI>their</HI> parts, <HI>they</HI> think I have been writing a Book that confutes <HI>no body;</HI> &s;ince all the Mini&s;ters they can find agree with me, that a <HI>meer General</HI> Faith is good for <HI>nothing,</HI> and that Believers &s;hould have a particular Application of the Blood of Chri&s;t to their <HI>own</HI> Souls.</Q> I an&s;wer; Mini&s;ters may agree to|gether
<PB N="6" REF="005568_0005_10186A61F505CE88">in &s;aying <HI>all this,</HI> and yet be no nearer together in the Matter of <HI>Ju&s;tifying</HI> Faith than <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, Dr. <HI>Perkins</HI> ob&s;erves, that both <Q><HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> agree together in holding that Believers &s;hould have a <HI>particular</HI> Application of the Blood of Chri&s;t unto their <HI>own</HI> Souls: and yet, (&s;aith he) the Agreement is only <HI>in Words:</HI> For <HI>we</HI> hold a <HI>particular</HI> Application <HI>by Faith; they</HI> only <HI>by Hope</HI> and <HI>Conjecture.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o it is with many Mini&s;ters at this Day: all the Ap|plication <HI>they</HI> hold is only <HI>by Hope</HI> and <HI>Conjecture:</HI> they teach that when Men &s;ee the Fruits of Faith in them&s;elves, good Frames, and good Duties, <HI>they</HI> &s;hould thereby <HI>humbly hope</HI> and <HI>conjecture</HI> they have an Intere&s;t in the Blood of Chri&s;t; but they will not allow that one who is now an Hell-de&s;erving Sin|ner, &s;hould <HI>directly, immediately, before</HI> he &s;ees any good Thing in him&s;elf, believe that the <HI>Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth him from all his Sins.</HI> In order to &s;atisfy my &s;elf, whether the&s;e Men really held a <HI>particular Faith,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all their Talk <HI>for a particular Application,</HI> I have often a&s;ked them, what was the fir&s;t Thing a Man believes about Chri&s;t, when he be|lieves <HI>to Salvation?</HI> Whether he believes that <HI>he him&s;elf hath</HI> (not <HI>may</HI> have <HI>for</HI> accepting, or, <HI>if</HI> he will accept upon Go&s;|pel-Terms, as the Phra&s;e is, but actually <HI>hath now) Redemp|tion through his Blood,</HI> even <HI>the Forgivene&s;s of Sins, according to the Riches of God's Grace?</HI> And whether he will not have <HI>as much</HI> A&s;&s;urance of the Forgivene&s;s of <HI>his</HI> Sins, as he hath Faith? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It having been reported that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> held a <HI>general</HI> Faith, ina&s;|much as he had &s;aid, in a Sermon, that <HI>A&s;&s;urance was not of the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith;</HI> after I had found, that all he meant was, that <HI>A&s;&s;u|rance</HI> was not <HI>&s;o nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> but that a Man might be a <HI>true Believer,</HI> tho' he &s;hould be <HI>now</HI> in <HI>the dark,</HI> or even <HI>die in the dark</HI> about his State: (which Thing I al&s;o held) I a&s;k'd him whether a Man hath not <HI>as much A&s;&s;urance</HI> as he hath <HI>Faith:</HI> To which he reply'd, Yes, Yes. I heard him preach <HI>eight</HI> Sermons, and di&s;cours'd with him I believe more than <HI>eight</HI> Times upon the Subject; and by all he appear'd to me, to &s;peak out <HI>Shibbo|leth</HI> without any He&s;itation. I could never believe that <HI>he</HI> denied a <HI>parti|cular</HI> Faith, were it only for <HI>this;</HI> that <HI>he knows</HI> that <HI>he is of God;</HI> there being an <HI>heavenly Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> laid upon all &s;uch Per&s;ons to be Friends to <HI>that</HI> Faith. Accordingly, it may be ob&s;erved to the Honour of a <HI>parti|cular</HI> Faith, that of all the Men in the World who are Enemies to it, whether <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> or <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> (for the great <HI>embattell'd</HI> Army who are now again&s;t it, is a <HI>confederate</HI> Army made up of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>latter;</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf being <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> of the Ho&s;t) there is not one &s;ingle Per&s;on who knows that <HI>he is of God.</HI> For, who|ever <HI>knows</HI> that <HI>he</HI> is of God, <HI>can know</HI> it only by a <HI>particular</HI> Faith: And &s;uch an one had rather be burnt to A&s;hes, than be again&s;t <HI>that</HI> Faith <HI>by which</HI> he <HI>knows</HI> him&s;elf to be <HI>of God.</HI></NOTE> And being try'd <HI>this Way,</HI> they are found <HI>wanting,</HI> and can &s;ay nothing but <HI>Sibboleth, Sibboleth.</HI></P>

I freely own I have had great Fears, le&s;t <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Libertines</HI> who are always too plenty, and who &s;hew them|&s;elves after a Day of <HI>great Grace,</HI> &s;hould like <HI>vile Spiders</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Er&s;kine</HI> calls them) &s;uck Poi&s;on out of the <HI>Flower of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and pervert what I have written to their <HI>own De&s;tructi|on.</HI> But this I know, the Doctrine I advance is <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> dif|ferent from <HI>their's:</HI> (Tho' <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> were tho't <HI>Antinomians</HI> for holding it: perhaps never any one preached <HI>pure Go&s;pel</HI> without being <HI>honour'd</HI> with the <HI>re|proachful</HI> Name of an <HI>Antinomian:</HI>) For <HI>their</HI> Faith is a Man's believing that he <HI>hath been</HI> forgiven, and <HI>was actually</HI> in a <HI>State</HI> of Favour with God, <HI>before</HI> Faith; whereas according to <HI>our</HI> Faith, a Man doth not (to u&s;e <HI>Wendeline</HI>'s Words) <Q>believe that his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven him already, before the Act of be|lieving; but that he &s;hall have <HI>Forgivene&s;s of Sins:</HI> In the <HI>very Act</HI> of Ju&s;tification he believes his Sins <HI>are</HI> forgiven him, and <HI>&s;o</HI> receives <HI>Forgivene&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, The <HI>Antinomians</HI> don't hold it material, that there &s;hould be a Work of <HI>Conviction before,</HI> and a Work of <HI>Sanc|tification</HI> after Faith; whereas <HI>we</HI> maintain that no Man can <HI>truly</HI> believe <HI>his</HI> Sins are <HI>freely</HI> forgiven, till he &s;ees him&s;elf <HI>&s;lain by the Law;</HI> and that who&s;oever believes that he is <HI>clean|&s;ed</HI> in the <HI>Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> will be <HI>con&s;trained</HI> by the <HI>Love of Chri&s;t</HI> to <HI>clean&s;e him&s;elf from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit, and to perfect Holine&s;s in the Fear of God:</HI> So that if <HI>our</HI> Faith is guarded (as it <HI>always</HI> &s;hould be) with a Work of <HI>Convicti|on before,</HI> and Work of <HI>Sanctification behind, Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Libertines</HI> have nothing to do with it; in&s;tead of &s;peaking Comfort to <HI>&s;uch,</HI> it condemns them all to the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o one Thing more, which hath been Matter of much Concern to me, viz.

For my Part, thro' Grace, I have an univer&s;al Love towards Mini&s;ters; (more e&s;pecially tho&s;e who appear to have been inflamed with the Love of Chri&s;t, <HI>whoever</HI> they be, <HI>wherever</HI> they be, and <HI>however,</HI> in le&s;&s;er Matters, oppo&s;ite to me) and have felt my Heart wi&s;hing them well, and praying for them, even tho&s;e who are <HI>mo&s;t</HI> again&s;t me, a great Part of the Time that I have been writing this Book.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I Have oftentimes wonder'd, and believe I &s;hall continue wondring as long as I live, how it &s;hould come to pa&s;s, that in <HI>&s;o Prote&s;tant</HI> a Country as <HI>this,</HI> it &s;hould be a Di&s;|grace to any Man to be a <HI>true Prote&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>One mu&s;t be a Stranger to the State of Religion in <HI>New-England,</HI> not to know that a <HI>general</HI> Faith is in Vogue, not only among <HI>Arminians,</HI> but among <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> al&s;o, e&s;pecially of the Clergy; and that tho&s;e who maintain a <HI>particular</HI> Faith, are look'd upon to be <HI>Entha&s;ia&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Antinomians</HI> &amp;c. And yet the&s;e few <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts fal&s;ly &s;o called,</HI> are the only <HI>thorough Prote&s;tants</HI> in the Land: All the re&s;t, who&s;oever they be, do <HI>&s;o far</HI> turn their Backs upon the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants,</HI> and <HI>&s;ay a Confederacy</HI> with the <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Er&s;kine</HI> in a Sermon lately come among us, warns his Hearers again&s;t a <HI>general</HI> Faith, as what was renounced by their Forefathers as a <HI>BRANCH</HI> of <HI>POPERY.</HI> He refers to the&s;e Words in their <HI>national Covenant;</HI> <Q>We dete&s;t and refu&s;e the u&s;urped Authority of that <HI>Roman Antichri&s;t</HI>&mdash;His <HI>general</HI> and <HI>doubt&s;ome</HI> Faith.</Q></P>
<P>Nay, the Meridian Sun never was plainer to one tolerably acquainted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, than that <HI>this</HI> Faith is the Faith of <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and that a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith is the Faith of <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;anguine and undaunted Chri&s;tian Hero, <HI>Luther,</HI> is well known to have been the fir&s;t in the Reformation, who gave a Blow to that <HI>Man of Sin</HI> the Pope of <HI>Rome:</HI> And 'tis as well known to tho&s;e who have read his Works, that the chief Blow which is gave him, and which &s;et him a reeling, was by preaching down that <HI>general dark</HI> Faith, which <HI>then</HI> was, and <HI>now</HI> is held <HI>&s;o &s;acred,</HI> and by preaching up a <HI>parti|cular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith in the Room of it.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> al&s;o his Brother in the Reformation <HI>(par nobile fra|trum!)</HI> might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>like-minded</HI> meerly from his being a Reformer; for otherwi&s;e, in&s;tead of preaching People <HI>from Rome,</HI> he would have preach'd them to <HI>Rome</HI> again;

<P>The De&s;cription of ju&s;tifying Faith given by the Church of <HI>Holland</HI> is worthy al&s;o of particular Ob&s;ervation: It is, (&s;ay they) a <HI>&s;ure Knowledge</HI> of God and his Promi&s;es revealed to us in the Go&s;pel, and a <HI>hearty Confidence,</HI> that <HI>all my Sins are forgiven me.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dutch brief Compend of Chri&s;tian Religion. <HI>Vis.</HI></NOTE></P>

<PB N="12" REF="005568_0011_10186A7308027210"><Q>A ju&s;tifying Faith is not only a general Belief of the Articles of Faith, that Chri&s;t was dead and ro&s;e again for them that believe; but it is an <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> &s;tedfa&s;t <HI>Confidence,</HI> whereby e|very Man <HI>particularly</HI> doth apply <HI>to him&s;elf</HI> the general Promi&s;es of God, for the Hope of Remi&s;&s;ion of his Sins in Chri&s;t, that Chri&s;t died, ro&s;e again, and did all the re&s;t for <HI>him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Willet</HI>'s <HI>Synop&s;is Papi&s;mi 976.</HI> Which he cites from Dr. <HI>Per|kin</HI>'s <HI>Reformed Catholick,</HI> where, as well as in Dr. <HI>Abbot</HI> again&s;t Dr. <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> this Matter is largely treated of.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> the <HI>Martyrologi&s;t</HI> is &s;o zealous that he thinks it Bla&s;phemy to deny this Definition.</P>

<P>And that the Matter in Di&s;pute between the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> was fairly repre&s;ented, we are abundantly confirmed by the Papi&s;ts them&s;elves, who glory in their being Enemies to a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the <HI>Rhemi&s;ts,</HI> and the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> all determine that there is no <HI>Confidence</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> in &s;aving Faith.</P>

<P>The <HI>Rhemi&s;ts</HI> &s;ay, <Q>That Faith by which we are ju&s;tified, is a general or univer&s;al believing of the Articles of Chri&s;t's Death and Re&s;urrection, not any <HI>fond &s;pecial</HI> Faith, or Confidence of <HI>each Man's own Salvation.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhemi&s;t Annot.

<P>The&s;e Cur&s;es are to this Day in <HI>full Force and Virtue;</HI> &s;o that we are all <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> and <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> again by the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> as well as reproach'd by <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> for the &s;ame Cau&s;e, even for our maintaining this heavenly Doctrine, viz. That a poor Sinner, in order to his being ju&s;tified, mu&s;t believe Chri&s;t to be <HI>his</HI> Saviour, and <HI>his</HI> Redeemer. But the <HI>Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come;</HI> there is no <HI>cur&s;ing them</HI> whom the <HI>Lord ble&s;&s;eth:</HI> I de&s;ire to take <HI>the&s;e Cur&s;es,</HI> and <HI>the&s;e Reproaches,</HI> and <HI>bind them as a Crown to my Head,</HI> e&s;teeming it the greate&s;t Glory of my Life, that I have been counted worthy to &s;uffer Shame in this glorious Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>That which &s;tirs up the Enmity of the Papi&s;ts, and cau&s;es them to <HI>oppo&s;e, cur&s;e</HI> and <HI>burn</HI> the Maintainers of this Doc|trine, is a Jealou&s;ie they have, le&s;t it &s;hould one Day de&s;troy Popery from the Face of the Earth: for they can fore&s;ee, without any Spirit of Prophe&s;y, that if a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith &s;hould once gain Ground in the World, <HI>their</HI> Kingdom which is founded upon <HI>Darkne&s;s, Doubting</HI> and <HI>Uncertainty,</HI> mu&s;t inevitably tumble to the Ground: they could no longer keep up a Market of <HI>Indulgences, Ma&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Pilgrimages,</HI> &amp;c. and the Fire of <HI>Purgatory</HI> would be quite <HI>put out.</HI></P>
<P>For which Rea&s;on it is a&s;toni&s;hing to me, that the Doctrine of a <HI>general</HI> Faith, which as the <HI>Smoke of the bottomle&s;s Pit,
<PB N="14" REF="005568_0013_10186A7738F851F0">darkens the Air and the Sun,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o care&s;s'd in a Coun|try as zealous for the general Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e as any in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I make no Doubt but there are many People in the Land, and &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who have fallen in Love with this Antichri&s;tian Doctrine, who yet out of Allegience to King GEORGE, or rather to King JESUS, would <HI>die the Death,</HI> and be burnt to A&s;hes, rather than be reconciled to that <HI>Mother of Abominations,</HI> the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Why then have they gone &s;o far <HI>backwards,</HI> as to &s;ymbolize with her, in this great Article of Chri&s;tian Religion? All I can learn they have to &s;ay for them&s;elves, is only this; viz. <Q>That the Divines who came after, found out that <HI>Luther</HI> and the other Reformers had not rightly defin'd Faith by putting <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> into the Nature of it.</Q></P>
<P>This Solution, if weigh'd in the Balance, will be found <HI>ligh|ter than nothing and Vanity:</HI> For, <HI>Luther</HI> and the other Refor|mers, were either <HI>quite right,</HI> or el&s;e quite <HI>wrong</HI> in putting A&s;|&s;urance into the Nature of Faith. If <HI>they</HI> were <HI>quite right</HI> then the&s;e Men are <HI>quite wrong</HI> in finding Fault with their Defi|nition of Faith: But if the Reformers were <HI>quite wrong</HI> (as <HI>the&s;e</HI> Men &s;uppo&s;e) then the&s;e Things will follow, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be maintained by them; viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Papi&s;ts were in the Right, in condemning this Doctrine as Here&s;y, and warning again&s;t, and oppo&s;ing <HI>the Prote&s;tants</HI> for preaching it up, provided they had kept within the Bounds of Moderation, and had not proceeded to <HI>cur&s;ing</HI> and <HI>burning.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That every one who died for a <HI>particular,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith, (for, as a certain learned Author ob&s;erves, <Q>it was &s;eal|ed with the Blood of <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Flames:</Q> there is no Doubt but <HI>Tindal</HI> and <HI>Hamilton,</HI> were hurried to the Stake, and burnt, in a great Mea&s;ure for their Zeal for this Doctrine) I &s;ay it follows that every one of the&s;e died <HI>as a Fool dieth,</HI> not as Witne&s;&s;es to the Truth, but as Witne&s;&s;es to a Fal&s;hood, of which the Devil was the Author; for he is the Author of all fal&s;e Religion; &s;o that they were all the Devil's Martyrs, and not Chri&s;t's.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Preaching of this fal&s;e Divinity of which Sa|tan, the fal&s;e Spirit was the Author, was the Means of carry|ing on that wonderful Work of Reformation which we have
<PB N="15" REF="005568_0014_10186A7A17217A70">heard and read &s;o much of, when Thou&s;ands and Thou&s;ands were &s;uppos'd to <HI>flock unto</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a Cloud, and as <HI>Doves unto their Windows,</HI> and <HI>Nations</HI> were <HI>born in a Day.</HI> For, one mu&s;t be very ignorant of tho&s;e Times, not to know that People were taught <HI>no other</HI> Way to the Favour of God, than by a <HI>particular,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith, and that this Doctrine was forever &s;ounding in their Ears. And Oh, how &s;weetly would &s;uch Talk as this <HI>for</HI> the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t</HI> the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants,</HI> &s;ound in the Ears of the <HI>Pope, Cardinals, Friers, Monks,</HI> and the Re&s;t of their religious Rabble, cau&s;ing their very Hearts within them to <HI>leap for Joy!</HI> And did they think this was the <HI>common</HI> Talk; would they not together with their Thank-offerings to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and other Saints, both good and bad for the hopeful Pro&s;pect, think it almo&s;t Time to &s;end over another <HI>Reginald Poole,</HI> to forgive us in the Pope's Name, for what was pa&s;t, and to reconcile us <HI>more perfectly</HI> to Holy Mother Church? And yet really this, is in Effect the Talk of every one who &s;aith <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> and tho&s;e who fir&s;t broke away from the Pope, <Q>did not define Faith right by putting <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> into the Nature of it.</Q> All <HI>that Popi&s;h</HI> Talk is wrapt up in this one Saying: So that <HI>hereby,</HI> they <HI>crock</HI> and <HI>be&s;mear</HI> them&s;elves &s;o, that all the Water in the Sea will not wa&s;h off the <HI>Popi&s;h Smutt.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;ome who came after tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Heroes, did &s;ee, or pretend to &s;ee that the Reformers ought not to have put any <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> into the Definition of ju&s;tifying Faith, I make no Doubt: But then it is clear from what hath been &s;aid, that their Eyes were anointed with <HI>Popi&s;h Eye-Salve</HI> which made them &s;o quick-&s;ighted.</P>
<P>And accordingly, when a Number of them in <HI>Scotland</HI> of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s Faction, pretended to &s;ee the Fal&s;hood of that Faith, <Q>declaring that there was no <HI>per&s;onal Confidence</HI> in it, and that <HI>per&s;onal Application</HI> was meer Pre&s;umption, and the <HI>Fiction of a cra&s;y Brain.</HI></Q> Mr. <HI>Robert Bailey,</HI> then Mini&s;ter of <HI>Kilwinning,</HI> afterwards one of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly,</HI> wrote again&s;t them, charg|ing them with <HI>Popery</HI> for that very A&s;&s;ertion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torla motuum in Regno Scotice, Pag. <HI>517.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And if there was that Zeal for <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> which there was then (An. Dom. 1640) in the Churches
<PB N="16" REF="005568_0015_10186A7F0FEEF6D8">of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uch <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Talk would be born Te&s;timony again&s;t, and not be <HI>countenanc'd</HI> by whole A&s;&s;emblies of Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>But to return, How &s;hall we account for this Thing which &s;eems &s;o unaccountable; viz. That there &s;hould be &s;uch a <HI>warping</HI> towards <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>&s;o Prote&s;tant</HI> a Country as <HI>this?</HI></P>
<P>In general; this <HI>Phenomenon</HI> mu&s;t be re&s;olved into <HI>Darkne&s;s:</HI> 'Tis <HI>becau&s;e Darkne&s;s covers the Earth, and gro&s;s Darkne&s;s the People.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>general</HI> Faith is a Doctrine of <HI>Darkne&s;s:</HI> It is a Weed that grows only in the <HI>Shade,</HI> and <HI>withers</HI> when the Sun looks upon it.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Time of that glorious Reformation, of which I have been &s;peaking, when God <HI>&s;ent forth his Light,</HI> and his <HI>Truth,</HI> it <HI>&s;hrunk up</HI> before the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> but when the heavenly Light was withdrawn, it <HI>flouri&s;hed again,</HI> poor People <HI>grop'd in the dark,</HI> and blunder'd backwards to|wards <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>So it hath al&s;o been in this &s;econd Reformation; while the <HI>glorious Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hined</HI> into the Hearts of Mi|ni&s;ters, the Meeting Hou&s;es rang, and the Fields eccho'd with a particular Faith; (no Mini&s;ter <HI>can</HI> feel <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of the Love of Chri&s;t in his own Soul, without preaching it) but now &s;ince the <HI>Lord hath departed,</HI> even the <HI>Glory of the Lord that was ri&s;en</HI> upon them; alas, how &s;eldom do we <HI>hear the joyful Sound!</HI> When Mini&s;ters don't <HI>know</HI> that <HI>they</HI> have Chri&s;t <HI>for nothing,</HI> they can't find in their Hearts to believe that others may have him <HI>for nothing:</HI> and then <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>&s;elling</HI> Chri&s;t comes in the Room of <HI>free Grace:</HI> their <HI>benighted</HI> Hearers al&s;o, <HI>love to have it &s;o;</HI> a <HI>general</HI> Faith is what alone will go down with <HI>them;</HI> like <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> before mentioned, they think it Pre&s;umption for a poor Sinner to apply Chri&s;t and his Benefits <HI>to Him&s;elf,</HI> before he hath &s;omething to pay, i.e. before he finds in him&s;elf a <HI>Willingne&s;s</HI> to <HI>make him welcome.</HI></P>
<P>By what hath been &s;aid, I tru&s;t it is evident what is the Faith of <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and what is the Faith of <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and withal that 'tis <HI>&s;ea&s;onable</HI> to oppo&s;e the <HI>latter,</HI> and defend the <HI>former;</HI> which I &s;hall endeavour to do by the following Arguments.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Devils believe Chri&s;t to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, <HI>Mark</HI> i. 24. And if Men at Conver&s;ion only believe him to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, <HI>wherein</HI> doth the Faith of <HI>Devils</HI> differ from the <HI>Faith of God's Elect?</HI></P>
<P>I know it will be &s;aid, the <HI>Effects</HI> of their Faith are <HI>different:</HI> To which I an&s;wer, <HI>qualis cau&s;a, talis effectus;</HI> If the <HI>Effects</HI> are <HI>different,</HI> &s;o are the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> which produce them; and con&s;equently Faith in tho&s;e accur&s;ed Spirits mu&s;t have <HI>another Difference</HI> than what lies in the <HI>Effects:</HI> which Difference can lie <HI>no where,</HI> but where I have plac'd it; viz. That the <HI>former</HI> only believe Chri&s;t to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, while the <HI>latter</HI> believe him to be <HI>their</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>For, as 'tis Men's <HI>taking God at his Word,</HI> that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is <HI>their</HI> Saviour, which makes them <HI>new Creatures;</HI> &s;o, did God by his Spirit convince the Devils that there was in Chri&s;t Salvation <HI>for them</HI> (which he never will do) they could be Devils no more. The &s;ame Di&s;covery from the Spirit of God, which makes the former cea&s;e to be <HI>wicked Men,</HI> would make the latter cea&s;e to be <HI>evil Angels.</HI></P>
<P>However, if any one &s;hould think that the e&s;&s;ential Dif|ference between the Faith of Devils, and of <HI>good Men</HI> lies here; that the <HI>former</HI> only believe him to be <HI>a</HI> Saviour, but not of any of their Race, while the latter believe him to be a Saviour of the humane Race. I an&s;wer, this Solution ra|ther hurts than helps their Cau&s;e: For if a little <HI>general Pro|bality</HI> of Salvation by Chri&s;t, is &s;uppo&s;ed the Means of ma|king a Man a new Creature, while the Devils who have <HI>no Hope</HI> remain Devils &s;till notwith&s;tanding their Faith; how much <HI>more likely</HI> is it that Men would be <HI>renewed in the Spirit
<PB N="18" REF="005568_0017_10186A84A75CF338">of their Minds</HI> by a <HI>&s;ure</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion that Chri&s;t and all his Benefits belonged <HI>to them in particular?</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, &s;ince the <HI>general</HI> Faith I am now oppo&s;ing, can't be made out <HI>any Way</HI> to be <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different from the <HI>Faith of Devils;</HI> the <HI>Faith of God's Elect</HI> mu&s;t be a <HI>particular</HI> Faith, whereby a Man not only believes Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the Saviour of <HI>Sinners in general,</HI> but the Saviour of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> a mo&s;t vile and mi&s;erable Sinner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Second</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Faith in Chri&s;t is in Scripture &s;et forth by a Marriage. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. <HI>7.4.</HI> Rev. <HI>19.7.</HI> Eph. <HI>5.32.2</HI> Cor. <HI>11.2.</HI></NOTE> But what Woman ever gives her &s;elf in Marriage to a Man, without looking upon him as <HI>her</HI> Friend, as one that loves <HI>her,</HI> and gives him&s;elf to <HI>her?</HI> If all this were wanting, that which is e&s;&s;ential to a Marriage would be wanting: And yet this is all wanting in the &s;piritual Marriage be|tween Chri&s;t and the Believer according to a <HI>general</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>The Soul gives her &s;elf to Chri&s;t, without looking upon him as <HI>her</HI> Friend, as one who loves <HI>her,</HI> or &s;o much as ever intended Marriage with <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed if a Woman &s;hould marry a Man <HI>in the Dark,</HI> and give her &s;elf to him to be his lawful Wife, only becau&s;e &s;he thought him a likely Man, and had heard that he wanted a Wife; &s;uch a Marriage as this, would be well repre&s;ented by a <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>general</HI> Faith. But was there ever &s;uch a Mar|riage as <HI>this?</HI> Or, if ever any Woman &s;hould be &s;o much <HI>out of her Wits,</HI> as to marry her &s;elf to a Man in this Man|ner; all wi&s;e Men would look upon the Marriage to be a Nullity.</P>
<P>Wherefore, &s;ince the Holy Gho&s;t repre&s;ents Faith to us by a Marriage; and &s;ince a <HI>general</HI> Faith will admit of no|thing between Chri&s;t and the Soul like a Marriage; it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be in the Way of a particular Faith, that poor Sinners are married to the <HI>Lamb of God.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Third</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Another Argument again&s;t a <HI>general</HI> Faith, is that it &s;up|po&s;es Men to make <HI>God a Liar,</HI> at the very Time of their Conver&s;ion. Who is he that <HI>maketh God a Liar,</HI> but he that believeth not the <HI>Record</HI> which he hath given of his Son? And this is the <HI>Record</HI> (O glorious <HI>Record!</HI>) that <HI>God hath given to US eternal Life in his Son.</HI> 1 Joh. 5.10, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005568_0018_10186A880F944030">
If therefore at Conver&s;ion, we don't believe that <HI>God gives eternal Life to</HI> US, we make <HI>him a Liar.</HI></P>
<P>It don't excu&s;e us, let us believe never &s;o firmly that God <HI>gives eternal Life</HI> to <HI>Sinners in general:</HI> No, we mu&s;t put <HI>OUR SELVES</HI> into the Number, and believe that <HI>God gives eternal Life</HI> to <HI>US,</HI> or el&s;e we make <HI>him a Liar</HI> according to the very Words of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Some may think the Difficulty &s;olv'd by &s;aying that the <HI>Record</HI> means that God gives eternal Life to us Sinners, <HI>if</HI> we will believe. <HI>If</HI> we will believe! That is, if we will <HI>pay</HI> for it: for <HI>here</HI> believing &s;tands for <HI>working;</HI> and <HI>working</HI> is the <HI>&s;ame Thing</HI> with <HI>paying.</HI> There mu&s;t be <HI>no legal ifs; one if</HI> &s;poils all: For this only is <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>&s;trictly</HI> Go&s;pel, viz. That God <HI>gives Eternal Life</HI> to Sinners <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> not <HI>if</HI> they will believe, but <HI>whether they believe or no:</HI> tho' without their believing, or <HI>taking</HI> the <HI>un&s;peakable Gift</HI> will <HI>profit them nothing,</HI> but only be a Means of their receiving the <HI>greater Damnation.</HI> Nor is this a Doctrine of <HI>Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> as <HI>Satan</HI> would per&s;wade the World: On the contrary 'tis the <HI>only Cure</HI> for a <HI>licentious Life.</HI> Convictions will not do; though the <HI>Pains of Hell get hold</HI> of Sinners, yet they are liable afterwards to return like <HI>the Dog to his Vomit, and like the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the Mire.</HI> But can a Man &s;in again&s;t a God giving <HI>eternal Life</HI> to him?&mdash; No verily, when once the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> of God <HI>his</HI> Saviour hath appeared to <HI>him,</HI> all the Devils in Hell can't make him in Love with a wicked Life any longer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Fourth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>As the Doctrine of a general Faith reflects upon the ever-ble&s;&s;ed God, &s;o doth it upon Man too, by &s;uppo&s;ing him to be &s;tupid and irrational at Conver&s;ion; <HI>when</HI> all Men accor|ding to the Scripture, <HI>come to them&s;elves,</HI> though they were <HI>be&s;ides them&s;elves</HI> before. Luke 15.17. It will be granted that what a convinced Sinner wants, is to &s;ee that <HI>he</HI> hath a Right to <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> Well, by a divine and &s;upernatural Light, he comes to &s;ee that <HI>who&s;oever will,</HI> hath a <HI>Right</HI> to Chri&s;t, and yet he don't &s;ee that <HI>he</HI> hath a <HI>Right</HI> to him! Was ever any Thing more ab&s;urd! Suppo&s;e one among a Com|pany of condemned Malefactors in Pri&s;on, expecting Exe|cution, &s;hould verily believe that the King hath &s;ent Orders that <HI>who&s;oever will</HI> &s;hall have his Liberty, and yet at the &s;ame Time &s;hould not &s;ee that <HI>he</HI> had his Liberty; would
<PB N="20" REF="005568_0019_10186A8A8DB75E28">not every one &s;ap that herein he was more like a <HI>Stock</HI> or a <HI>Stone,</HI> than a rea&s;onable Man?</P>
<P>Thus doth this Doctrine &s;uppo&s;e Men to exerci&s;e no more Rea&s;on at Conver&s;ion, I won't &s;ay than Brutes, (for Brutes are wi&s;er: when they want Liberty, no &s;ooner are the Bars let down, but <HI>every one</HI> &s;ees Liberty <HI>for him&s;elf:</HI>) but than Stones and <HI>Stumps;</HI> and yet <HI>them</HI> all Men, however it was with them <HI>before,</HI> or may be <HI>afterwards,</HI> have the cleare&s;t Exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But where would be the Harm, if they &s;hould allow a ra|tional Creature tran&s;acting for Eternity, to be as wi&s;e as the <HI>Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h?</HI> When the&s;e &s;ee a <HI>general</HI> Privilege, they always &s;ee a <HI>particular</HI> Privilege <HI>for them&s;elves.</HI> And why will they not allow that when a poor condemned Sinner &s;ees Salvation for Sinners in <HI>general</HI> in Chri&s;t, he &s;hould <HI>at the &s;ame Time,</HI> &s;ee Salvation <HI>for him&s;elf in particular?</HI> Why, this would be to &s;uppo&s;e too much <HI>Light</HI> in Conver&s;ion, and <HI>that</HI> they are dreadfully afraid of: If Conver&s;ion is <HI>all Darkne&s;s,</HI> (as to a Man's <HI>own</HI> Ca&s;e) <HI>it is all good:</HI> there can't be <HI>too much Darkne&s;s;</HI> but the lea&s;t <HI>Glimmering</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> would <HI>&s;poil all.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Fifth</HI> ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>general</HI> Faith makes Men &s;piritual <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers.</HI> God gives Chri&s;t to the Children of Men according to the Scriptures.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. <HI>49.6.</HI> Rom. <HI>3.32.</HI></NOTE> Accordingly Believing is &s;aid to be a <HI>Receiving</HI> of Chri&s;t. 1 John 1.12. Now a Man cannot hone&s;tly <HI>re|ceive</HI> a Gift, without &s;eeing the <HI>Gift</HI> was made to <HI>him:</HI> If he doth, 'tis not properly <HI>receiving</HI> (for <HI>Giving</HI> and <HI>Receiving</HI> are <HI>Correlates;</HI> but only <HI>taking without Leave,</HI> or <HI>Stealing:</HI> And the Thing thus <HI>fraudulently</HI> taken is what he hath <HI>no Right</HI> to. If I &s;hould give a Crown to a poor Man, and he &s;hould take it, without &s;eeing that I did really intend to give it to <HI>him,</HI> he would be a <HI>Thief</HI> and a <HI>Robber,</HI> and remain without <HI>any Right</HI> to the Money, which would have been <HI>his own,</HI> had he been convinced that I gave it to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Now the great and good God, hath given <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to a poor peri&s;hing World; If any Man <HI>believes the Record,</HI> and takes Je&s;us Chri&s;t as <HI>given</HI> of God to <HI>him,</HI> Chri&s;t and all his Benefits, are <HI>his immediately:</HI> But whoever pretends to take Chri&s;t, without being per&s;waded that God gives Chri&s;t to
<PB N="21" REF="005568_0020_10186A8C664EEA50"><HI>him,</HI> only &s;teals <HI>him,</HI> and hath <HI>no Lot,</HI> nor <HI>Inheritance</HI> in him: The old Proverb, <HI>no Good comes by &s;tealing,</HI> mu&s;t hold good in Things of a &s;piritual, as well as in Things of a temporal Nature.</P>
<P>This is certainly a parallel Ca&s;e: The <HI>former</HI> is not more properly <HI>temporal,</HI> than the <HI>latter</HI> is <HI>&s;piritual</HI> thieving. &mdash; Wherefore, &s;ince a <HI>general</HI> Faith puts the whole World upon <HI>&s;tealing Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;ince it teaches every Man to <HI>&s;natch at him in the dark,</HI> and to <HI>take</HI> him without &s;eeing that Chri&s;t belongs to <HI>him,</HI> and con&s;equently to dream that he <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es</HI> a Saviour when he doth not, to the infinite Hazzard of his Soul; it follows plainly that a <HI>general</HI> Faith, is not the <HI>Faith of God's Elect.</HI></P>

<P>Suppo&s;e a King &s;hould publi&s;h an <HI>Act of Grace</HI> in Favour of Pirates, declaring that <HI>who&s;oever will,</HI> &s;hall have the Be|nefit of it, and yet at the &s;ame Time <HI>embara&s;s</HI> it with this Clau&s;e, viz.

<P>To pre&s;s all Men to believe that Chri&s;t and Forgivene&s;s are <HI>theirs,</HI> i. e. <HI>in Right</HI> and by God's <HI>Grant,</HI> is &s;o far from pre&s;&s;ing them to <HI>believe a Lie,</HI> that it is pre&s;&s;ing them to <HI>be|lieve a great Go&s;pel-Truth,</HI> or rather the <HI>Truth of the Go&s;pel.</HI> For, <HI>What &s;aith the Scripture?</HI> Why, <HI>that God &s;ent his Son to be the Saviour of the World;</HI> (Joh. 4.14.) that <HI>he gave him for a Covenant of the People, and for a Light to the Gentiles;</HI> (I&s;a.42.6.) that <HI>who&s;oever will may come, and take of the Waters of Life freely,</HI> (Rev. 22.17.) Nay, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved all the Ends of the Earth,</HI> I&s;ai. 45.22.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e and &s;uch like Declarations &s;hew us that Chri&s;t is <HI>by Office,</HI> whatever he is <HI>in the Event, the Saviour of every Man:</HI> that one Man hath as much <HI>Right</HI> as another to <HI>lay hold on eternal Life,</HI> and that <HI>all</HI> Men are <HI>warranted</HI> and <HI>commanded</HI> &s;o to do in the Word of God. The Matter may be illu&s;trated in the following Manner. &mdash; Suppo&s;e a King, in Con&s;ideration of his Son's <HI>Mediation</HI> in behalf of certain condemned Traitors, obliges him&s;elf to be&s;tow his Pardon and Favour upon tho&s;e who will come to him, and receive &s;uch Kindne&s;s at his Hands, &mdash; Have not all tho&s;e Traitors a <HI>Right,</HI> and one ju&s;t as good a <HI>Right</HI> as another to the King's Pardon and Favour? And would it be ab&s;urd in any one to pre&s;s them to believe they had &s;uch a <HI>Right,</HI> and to make u&s;e of it? And if any &s;tood out, while it was too late and mi&s;s'd of it, would not their <HI>Blood be upon their own Heads?</HI> mo&s;t cer|tainly. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life,</HI> &s;aith our Saviour, John 5.40. i. e. Eternal Life is <HI>yours,</HI> by God's Grant, but ye will not accept of it, and &s;o <HI>mu&s;t</HI> peri&s;h!</P>
<P>Tho' there is a &s;ecret <HI>Decree</HI> of God, yet this Matter &s;hould be con&s;ider'd <HI>ab&s;tractly,</HI> as if there were none at all: I mean, we &s;hould not <HI>limit</HI> God's <HI>Grant</HI> by any <HI>Decree.</HI> Accordingly it is ob&s;ervable, that tho' the Apo&s;tle fully believed the De|crees of God, yet they preached Chri&s;t and Salvation by him as <HI>freely</HI> as if they knew every one of their Hearers to be e|lected. Thus have I fairly di&s;mi&s;s'd this Argument by &s;hew|ing that it confutes not what we maintain, but only what we abhor as well as they.</P>
<P>However, if the Objecters are not quite weaned from it, I would mention one thing more which will &s;poil it forever for <HI>their U&s;e;</HI> and that is, it concludes as &s;trongly again&s;t <HI>their</HI>

<P><HI>But this particular Per&s;wa&s;ion and A&s;&s;urance, Chri&s;t is mine (affirmed to be &s;aving Faith) leaves a true Believer under the Sen&s;e of his Sin and Mi&s;ery, without Support.</HI> Ergo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P>We own the Charge Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> brings again&s;t a <HI>parti|cular</HI> Faith, and <HI>glory</HI> in it too: Nay we &s;hould not think it worth having, if we could not &s;ay the &s;ame Thing in <HI>Favour</HI> of it, which he &s;aith again&s;t it, viz. <HI>That it leaves all Sorts of Per&s;ons, &s;inking under a Sen&s;e of their Sin and Mi&s;ery, without any Support,</HI> i. e. without any Support of
<PB N="43" REF="005568_0042_10186AC647592A20">their <HI>own Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to lean upon. Nor do we fear their <HI>&s;inking,</HI> &s;ince they will only <HI>&s;ink</HI> into the Arms of Chri&s;t, into which if they are kept from <HI>&s;inking</HI> by <HI>&s;uch Supports,</HI> they mu&s;t one Day <HI>&s;ink</HI> into Hell.</P>
<P>That <HI>all</HI> convinced Sinners would <HI>immediately</HI> be <HI>&s;ure</HI> that Chri&s;t and Forgivene&s;s are <HI>theirs,</HI> were it not for their <HI>own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which they lean upon, I think is evi|dent from what hath been &s;aid upon the IIId Argument. However, if any are not &s;atisfied with what is written there; I would ask them whether every Man who be|lieves there is a God, doth not always believe there is <HI>&s;ome</HI> Way into his Favour, either <HI>by Works,</HI> or <HI>without Works:</HI> To this they mu&s;t &s;ay <HI>Yes;</HI> and this is, in Ef|fect, giving up the Point: For when a Sinner is hear|tily convinc'd that the Way into God's Favour is not <HI>by Works,</HI> then he &s;ees it is <HI>without Works;</HI> and when he &s;ees it is without Works, he <HI>cannot help</HI> &s;eeing that <HI>he</HI> is welcome to the Favour of God, <HI>ju&s;t as he is,</HI> without any <HI>Alteration</HI> in him. This mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to be fair Rea&s;oning: And if it is, then it is plain that all the Support which any have without &s;eeing Chri&s;t to be <HI>their</HI> Saviour, and <HI>Forgivene&s;s theirs,</HI> is only a Support of their <HI>own Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and con&s;equently that this Argument of Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI>'s al&s;o, e&s;tabli&s;hes the Faith he in|tended to de&s;troy by it; and we may conclude it to be <HI>true</HI> Faith, becau&s;e it doth not, like <HI>theirs,</HI> &s;peak any Comfort to Men while they lean upon their <HI>own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Argument, I would ob&s;erve that 'tis calculated, as much again&s;t <HI>Calvin,</HI> as if Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> had had <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Eye, and intended a Confutation of him.&mdash;<HI>Calvin</HI> &s;aith, that <Q>the Con&s;ciences of the faithful when the <HI>Affiance</HI> of their Ju&s;tification before God is to be &s;ought, &s;hould rai&s;e them&s;elves above the Law, and forget the whole Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law, and lay a&s;ide all thinking upon Works. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;t. Pag. <HI>403.</HI></NOTE></Q> But <HI>this</HI> Divinity Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Argument, and what he &s;aith <HI>upon it,</HI> makes to be Here&s;y: <HI>He</HI> would have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Souls <HI>keep clo&s;e to the Law,</HI> and not forget the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of it: He would have others comfort them with Marks and Signs (by which Means they are often comforted into Hell) though the poor Souls don't &s;ee that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is <HI>their</HI> Saviour, and that all his Benefits belong to <HI>them.</HI> And yet Mr. <HI>Firmin</HI> was a <HI>Calvini&s;t!</HI> Nay, the <HI>Generality</HI> &s;o
<PB N="44" REF="005568_0043_10186ACB2526E8F8"><HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> at <HI>this Day</HI> (as well as <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Arminians</HI>) are of <HI>one Heart</HI> and Soul with him in this Matter! I call them <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> (though at be&s;t, they are no more than <HI>Semi-Calvini&s;ts</HI> who are again&s;t <HI>Calvin</HI> in <HI>&s;o many great</HI> Articles of Religion) becau&s;e they <HI>will not</HI> part with the <HI>Name.</HI> Would to God they lov'd the <HI>Thing,</HI> as well as they do the <HI>Name!</HI> This would make happy Times for <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have we fairly try'd a general Faith at the Bar of Scripture and Rea&s;on, having examin'd many Evidences <HI>for</HI> it, and <HI>again&s;t</HI> it; and upon the whole, it appears, that it is &s;o far from <HI>ju&s;tifying,</HI> that 'tis only <HI>Chri&s;t-de&s;pi|&s;ing, Man-exalting,</HI> and <HI>Soul-condemning</HI> Faith; for which Rea&s;on it ought it&s;elf to be <HI>condemned,</HI> and <HI>&s;entenced to die the Death.</HI> And would to God that the <HI>Sentence</HI> might <HI>&s;peedily be executed!</HI> O that Believers would join their Forces together, and <HI>pray it to Death:</HI> May we all with one Heart, and one Soul, be&s;iege the Throne of Grace, and give God <HI>no Re&s;t,</HI> 'till he <HI>de&s;troy.</HI> it out of the World, by the <HI>Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightne&s;s of his Appearing.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter,</HI> &s;hall be to exhort every one into who&s;e Hands this little Book may come, not to be &s;o cruel to his own Soul, as to venture it any longer upon a <HI>general</HI> Faith; But to &s;ee to it, that he hath a <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> Faith, that Chri&s;t is <HI>his</HI> Saviour, and that all his Benefits do really belong to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I know the World hates the Doctrine of <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> (per|haps all the Errors and Imprudences that have been in the Land the&s;e few Years pa&s;t, have not vext the World &s;o much as this one <HI>glorious</HI> Doctrine of <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> which they have heard &s;o often ringing in their Ears:) Becau&s;e it <HI>con|demns</HI> the World; becau&s;e this <HI>Light</HI> being held up again&s;t their Religion, di&s;covers it to be <HI>Darkne&s;s:</HI> And hence it is that many who love the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Mini&s;ters, are full as bad as the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> them&s;elves, in prejudi|cing their Hearers again&s;t the <HI>full A&s;&s;urance of Faith.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> &s;ay, that the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, were not quite &s;ure of their own Salvation; and that Chri&s;tians now a days, mu&s;t not think of having <HI>full A&s;&s;urance;</HI> for this would be to go beyond the Apo&s;tles. <HI>Rhem. Annot. All</HI> the <HI>Arminians</HI> preach this Divinity; which is not to be wonder'd at; (for it is ea&s;y to make out to the World that every <HI>Armi|nian</HI> is <HI>more than three Quarters of a Papi&s;t:</HI>) But is it not &s;trange that profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> &s;hould &s;ymbolize with them? Among the many In|&s;tances that might be given, I &s;hall only mention what a certain Mini&s;ter fix'd up on his <HI>Mantle-Tree</HI> for the In&s;truction of tho&s;e who came to his Hou&s;e, viz. That the <Q><HI>Apo&s;tles and others were as &s;ure that</HI> Simon, Judas, <HI>and</HI> Nicholas <HI>were real Saints, as that they them&s;elves were, and &s;urer.</HI></Q></NOTE> But
<PB N="45" REF="005568_0044_10186ACE078F4998">let me intreat you, not to <HI>give Heed</HI> to any of their Words; <HI>The Poy&s;on of A&s;ps is under their Lips; De&s;truction and Mi|&s;ery are in their Ways:</HI> If <HI>they</HI> can be brisk and chearful, though every Time they &s;hut their Eyes to &s;leep, they do not <HI>know</HI> but that they may awake in Hell; do you have Pity upon your immortal Souls, and give your &s;elves no Re&s;t, 'till you have made <HI>&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>one Thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks I hear &s;ome poor Souls &s;aying: <Q>If we had a Thou&s;and Worlds, we would part with them all, for this <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of which you are &s;peaking.</Q> I an&s;wer; I wi&s;h you were willing to have it <HI>for Nothing:</HI> Do but let go your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and I dare pawn my Soul, that you &s;hall have it before I have done &s;peaking with you. <HI>Come now, let us rea&s;on together:</HI> What is the Difficulty, what is the <HI>Wall of Partition</HI> that lies in the Way to your having <HI>A&s;&s;urance?</HI> Is it that you are old Sinners, great Sinners, <HI>Sinners again&s;t God exceedingly?</HI> Why, my dear Friends, Sin is <HI>no Impediment</HI> at all; you have no more Rea&s;on to doubt of God's good Will towards you, than if you had never &s;inn'd, you are in as good a Ca&s;e as if you had never offended him, in Thought, in Word, or in Deed, <HI>having &s;uch an High-Prie&s;t:</HI> Though your Sins <HI>have abounded,</HI> the Grace of God hath <HI>a|bounded much more;</HI> though your Sins have reached unto the very Heavens, the Mercy of God in Chri&s;t is <HI>above the Hea|vens.</HI> Indeed, was <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> but a <HI>little</HI> Saviour, there would be good Rea&s;on for <HI>great</HI> Sinners to be afraid; nay, I my &s;elf &s;hould not have one Thought of being &s;aved by him. But he is a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, <HI>able to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t,</HI> I know him to be &s;uch a Saviour, and therefore, I, though a <HI>great</HI> Sinner, though the <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> am not afraid to venture my Soul upon him: And if I had all your Souls to take Care of, I would <HI>this Moment</HI> venture them all upon <HI>him,</HI> without one Doubt of his being willing to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>And every Doubt you have of Chri&s;t's Willingne&s;s, is only doubting whether he is a <HI>great</HI> Saviour, and whether the <HI>Re|cord</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="005568_0045_10186ACFB2C81B58">of God is true, which &s;aith that he hath in <HI>Chri&s;t given eternal Life to you:</HI> 1 Joh. 5.11.

Your Want of <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> therefore is founded upon this very Thing, viz. Your having a mean Opinion of him whom <HI>Man de&s;pi&s;eth, and the Nations abhor;</HI> you dare not &s;tand before God, in his Name <HI>as Sinners,</HI> but only as Saints: Whereas did you be|lieve in your Hearts, that he was able to &s;ave to the <HI>utter|mo&s;t,</HI> you could not help &s;eeing <HI>in him</HI> a Saviour for <HI>your|&s;elves:</HI> And though you knew you de&s;erved to be &s;ent to Hell, you could not have one Doubt, of the Mercy and Lovingkindne&s;s of God towards <HI>you.</HI> And O that God would anoint your Eyes <HI>with Eye-&s;alve,</HI> that the <HI>glorious Go|&s;pel</HI> which <HI>&s;hines</HI> round about you; might <HI>&s;hine</HI> into your Souls: That you might &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be your Saviour, and by the <HI>Sight</HI> be transformed into his Likene&s;s. I &s;ay <HI>transformed into his Likene&s;s:</HI> For one can't &s;ee the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without being <HI>like</HI> him, when the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> of God our Saviour appears to <HI>us,</HI> it <HI>always renews us in the Spirit of our Minds,</HI> making us as Je&s;us Chri&s;t was <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled and &s;eparate from Sinners:</HI> Which <HI>precious Faith,</HI> God of his infinite Mercy, grant may be vouch&s;afed to every one of my Readers for Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
