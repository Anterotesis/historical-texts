<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this reply was made from the mere hearing of that di&s;cour&s;e, which was the occa&s;ion of it. It cannot therefore be expected, that the very words &s;hould be exactly remembered, to be made u&s;e of in the reply. But &s;o far as the author's memory &s;erved him, he has candidly endea|voured, fairly to expre&s;s the &s;entiments held forth in &s;aid di&s;cour&s;e, as he received and under&s;tood at the hearing. And &s;o far as he has been able to learn, was generally under&s;tood by the auditory. And is as well a&s;&s;ured, as one well can be in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that there is no e&s;&s;ential mi&s;take made in any particular. Which &s;hould there happen to be; may be ea&s;ily &s;et to rights before the publick, by the publi&s;hing of &s;aid di&s;|cour&s;e. Which upon divers accounts, would be very agree|able to many of the hearers. And a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification of the &s;tile of this reply.</P>
<P>The view of the &s;criptures &s;ubjoined to the articles, is &s;et forth for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch, as have been too negligent, carefully to compare and examine for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And the appendix is added, merely to gratify the curio&s;ity of the inqui&s;itive.</P>

<HEAD>SERMONS On CHURCH GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Matt. 28.20.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TRULY my hearers, I am really di&s;po&s;ed to look upon it, an in&s;tance of the won|derful wi&s;dom of divine providence, in permitting &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e on church government&punc; to be delivered from this de&s;k, as you have lately heard. As not doubting, but it will prove an occa&s;ion, of the more clear and &s;atisfying manife&s;tation of the truth on that &s;ubject; to the minds of many of you: From the reply, which I have now, by this providence, a loud call of God to make. With a view, neither to gratify nor reflect upon any per&s;on or party; but to approve my&s;elf in my office, as becomes a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by a faithful manife&s;tation of the truth; and that in oppo&s;ition to all the dangerous errors ca&s;t in your way.</P>
<P>In regard to which, I earne&s;tly crave, my hearers, your &s;erious and candid attention, to the &s;cripture proofs and plain rea&s;onings, fairly grounded thereupon; which I have to offer on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You will &s;uffer me to u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, that if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch as are dull of hearing may di&s;cern and under&s;tand. Gladly would I &s;hun all per&s;onal re|flections:
<PB N="4" REF="013360_0004_0F90F30CF16059B0">But plain and pungent repre&s;entations, mu&s;t be admitted. I de&s;ire to be heard patiently through to the end: And then every one, will be under advantage, fairly to judge for them&s;elves, whether what may be of|fered, be agreeable to the law and to the te&s;timony or not.</P>
<P>For the foundation of what is intended, I have cho&s;en the words now read. <HI>Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI> To come at the full and proper force and meaning of which, it is requi&s;ite to look into the context a few ver&s;es back: In which an account is given, of the appearance of Je&s;us to the eleven di&s;ciples, on a mountain of Gallilee. <Q>And when they &s;aw him, they wor&s;hipped him: But &s;ome doubted.</Q> Ver. 16.17. <Q>And Je&s;us came and &s;pake unto them, &s;aying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</Q> Ver. 18. In which, Je&s;us made known to his di&s;ciples the fulne&s;s of power that he was inve&s;ted with by the father. As God indeed, the Son has in him&s;elf all power, equal with the Father. But as God man, mediator, his power was given to him of the Father. Even all power in heaven and in earth: Over all principalities and powers, both in this world and al&s;o in that which is to come. And of con&s;equence, all power both in the kingdom of providence and of grace. And as inve&s;ted with, and in virtue of, this plenitude of power, Je&s;us gave out a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion to his apo&s;tles, &s;aying as in the 19th ver. <Q>Go ye there|fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> As tho' he had &s;aid, having all power in heaven and in earth given unto me; I do therefore now commi&s;&s;ion, order, and &s;end forth you my apo&s;tles; to go teach and di&s;ciple all nations; baptizing all that believe my go&s;|pel; in the name of the &s;acred Three. <HI>Teaching them,</HI> as it follows in the words of our text, <HI>to ob&s;erve all things
<PB N="5" REF="013360_0005_0F90ECA9EE4F6C48">what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI> In the&s;e words then, we have the &s;pecial orders given by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the eleven di&s;ciples, his apo&s;tles, when he commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent them forth to teach and di&s;ciple the nations. Authori&s;ing and directing them, to teach tho&s;e that &s;hould be di&s;cipled; to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever he commanded. Which &s;trict injunction, to teach the ob&s;ervance of all his commandments, plainly implies a re&s;triction, not to teach the ob&s;ervance of any other commands. Je&s;us had indeed farther commands, yet to give unto his apo&s;tles. And yet this injunction, ever continued in force binding upon them; to teach all and no other ob&s;ervances, but &s;uch as he commanded. And now, tho' the apo&s;tles left no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in their proper apo&s;tolic office, yet this is the commi&s;&s;ion, by virtue of which, all go&s;pel mini&s;ters are authori&s;ed to teach and baptize. And according to which, they are all re&s;tricted to teach, even to the end of the world. For that in this &s;en&s;e, it has re&s;pect to all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters of the go&s;epl, is manife&s;t from the following &s;entence: "And lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world." In Mr. Henry's expo&s;ition, it is ob&s;erved upon the words of our text, <Q>That Chri&s;tians are hereby obliged to confine them&s;elves to the com|mands of Chri&s;t, and as not to dimini&s;h from them, &s;o not to add to them.</Q> And more generally, all di&s;|&s;enting divines, have taken the words in this re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e. According to which, go&s;pel mini&s;ters have no commi&s;&s;ion or authority from Chri&s;t, to teach his di&s;ci|ples, the ob&s;ervance of any laws whatever; but of tho&s;e only which he had commanded. So far as any go&s;pel mini&s;ter therefore, teaches the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving in the church of Chri&s;t, any canon laws and rules of hu|man devi&s;ing; he teaches for doctrine the command|ments of men: In direct violation of this his commi&s;&s;ion by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013360_0006_0F90F30DB3741A98">
But what we have now &s;pecially in view is, the com|mands of Chri&s;t re&s;pecting the government of his church. And here you are &s;en&s;ible the labouring enquiry is, whether Chri&s;t hath given laws &s;ufficient for the govern|ment of his church? The affirmative of which, I &s;hall endeavour to prove. In oppo&s;ition to that negative, which you have been lately taught. By this propo&s;ition; that Chri&s;t hath given laws &s;ufficient for the government of his church, is not meant, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Chri&s;t hath given rules in his word, in all re&s;pects &s;o explicit, as not to leave room for the u&s;e of a di&s;creti|onary prudence in the church: Re&s;pecting circum&s;tan|ces of time, place, &amp;c. Many things of this &s;ort, are left di&s;cretionary, in the brea&s;ts of the judges, in all, even the mo&s;t perfect civil &s;tates. But the meaning of the propo&s;ition is: That Chri&s;t has given laws, &s;o compleatly &s;ufficient for the government of his church, as not to need for that purpo&s;e, the addition of any canon laws or rules of human devi&s;ing. In this &s;en&s;e, I a&s;&s;ume the affirmative; in direct oppo&s;ition to that di&s;|cour&s;e in which it was plainly denied. And therefore pleaded, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of the addition of human rules and canons, for the purpo&s;es of church go|vernment.</P>
<P>But what can be requi&s;ite, to the laws of Chri&s;t being &s;ufficient for the government of his church; more than the&s;e three things? That the nature of the crimes cognizable, be &s;ufficiently &s;pecified: The judges, pointed out with &s;ufficient plainne&s;s: And the nature of the proof required, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed? In all the&s;e re&s;pects, it was &s;trenuou&s;ly argued and in&s;i&s;ted up|on, That the laws of Chri&s;t are not &s;ufficient. Nor was there, that I remember, any deficiency argued; but what is fully comprehended under one or the other of the&s;e propo&s;itions. If therefore, it can be made to appear,
<PB N="7" REF="013360_0007_0F90F30F22F29820">that the matters contained under the&s;e three particulars, are pointed out in the go&s;pel, with preci&s;ion &s;ufficient, for all the purpo&s;es of church government; it mu&s;t follow by the con&s;ent of all, that the laws of Chri&s;t are fully &s;uf|ficient for the government of his church, without the addi|tion of any human canons for that purpo&s;e. Wherefore let the &s;criptures be carefully attended to re&s;pecting the&s;e matters. And as to the crimes then, that are properly cognizable before the church. See 1 Cor. 5.11. <Q>But now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with &s;uch an one, no not to eat.</Q> Here is given an expre&s;s enumeration of &s;everal kinds of crimes; under the one or the other of which, are included mo&s;t of the &s;candalous crimes, that mankind are incident unto. But &s;ee al&s;o, 2 The&s;. 3.6. <Q>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that ye withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walk|eth di&s;orderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</Q> By walking is here plainly meant an open cour&s;e of life. For that cour&s;e of life, in which any man openly liveth, in that he is &s;aid to walk. And to walk di&s;orderly, is explained by the apo&s;tles own words to mean, walking not after, i. e. not agreeable to, the tradition received of us, the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. All which apo&s;tolic traditions, are now &s;et forth in wri|ting in the new te&s;tament. If any brother therefore, per|&s;i&s;ts in living openly contrary to &s;cripture rule; he is to be withdrawn from, or &s;eperated by the brotherhood from their communion. And &s;o again, it is added in the 14. v. <Q>And if any man obey not our word by this epi&s;tle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be a&s;hamed.</Q> But this epi&s;tle holds forth the validity of every divine rule. Every man therefore that lives in the open violation of any divine
<PB N="8" REF="013360_0008_0F90F30F469F5000">precept; is to be noted and his company avoided; in all matters of &s;pecial chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip. But farther here&s;y al&s;o, is particularly mentioned. Tit. 3.10. <Q>A man that is an heretick, after the fir&s;t and &s;econd admonition reject.</Q> Under which, all &s;candalous damnable error is included. Be&s;ides many other &s;crip|tures that might be mentioned directly to the purpo&s;e. But according to the&s;e already cited; all the commands of Chri&s;t, are to be con&s;idered as his laws &s;pecifying matters cognizable before his church. And what rati|onal man can now &s;ay, but that the crimes cognizable by a church, are pointed out in the go&s;pel with a preci|&s;ion abundantly &s;ufficient?</P>
<P>In the next place then, we are to con&s;ider, to whom it belongs to act and concur in judgment. And whether this matter be pointed out in &s;cripture with &s;ufficient plainne&s;s?</P>
<P>It has been much in&s;i&s;ted upon, that it cannot be learnt from &s;cripture, who the church are, or of what members it doth con&s;i&s;t. Becau&s;e the word church, is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the go&s;pel in different &s;en&s;es. But tho' the word church, is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the go&s;pel to different &s;en&s;es; yet by the church, when meaning the church of Chri&s;t, in its pre&s;ent vi&s;ible &s;tate here in this world: is always in the new te&s;tament plainly meant, a body or community of the &s;ame kind. And what &s;ort of a body that is, may plainly be di&s;cerned, from the model of the fir&s;t church of Chri&s;t at Jeru&s;alem. As &s;et forth Acts. 2.41; and on, <Q>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized: And the &s;ame day there were added unto them about three thou&s;and &s;ouls. And they continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the apo&s;tles doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.&mdash;And all that believed were toge|ther. &mdash;And they continued daily with one accord in
<PB N="9" REF="013360_0009_0F90F30FF1844500">the temple.&mdash;And the Lord added to the church daily &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved.</Q> Thus &s;uch as being baptized, were added to that number, which continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the apo&s;tles doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers, were thereby added to the church: Which number therefore was the church. And every &s;uch kind of number then, con&s;orting toge|ther for the like purpo&s;es, is a church. Wherefore there can be no doubt, what is meant in the go&s;pel by a church; when a church of Chri&s;t is intended. And in the next place we find, that the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline is committed to a church. And are plainly directed how it is to be introduced; and what the judgment or penalty to be inflicted upon incorrigible offenders. As in Mat. 18.15, and &s;o on. <Q>Moreover, if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: If he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I &s;ay unto you, what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven: And what&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven.</Q> Here it is carefully to be noted, that the very &s;ame church, unto which an offence is to be told; are to judge thereof; and that from their judgment, there lies no appeal to any other board under heaven. Becau&s;e expre&s;sly de|clared, that according to the judgment of &s;aid church, it &s;hall be bound or loo&s;ed in heaven. Whereby an ab|&s;olute bar is laid in, again&s;t the judgment of any other board on earth. And neither therefore to be attempted, but in direct violation of this expre&s;s law of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013360_0010_0F90F310B24DC308">
But it has been objected, that this could not be meant of a church of Chri&s;t: Becau&s;e his church was not yet formed. And mu&s;t have reference therefore to the Jewi&s;h church. <Q>But the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confe&s;s that he (Je&s;us) was the Chri&s;t, he &s;hould be put out of the &s;ynagague.</Q> Joh. 9.22. Nothing therefore can be more ab&s;urd, than to imagine, that Je&s;us here meant to direct his di&s;ciples, in ca&s;e offence &s;hould fall out among them&s;elves; to go and tell it to the Jewi&s;h church. The very &s;uppo&s;ition is an affront to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But altho' the church of Chri&s;t was not yet formed; yet, it is very clear from the context, that Chri&s;t is therein &s;peaking in &s;pecial reference to his church, when it &s;hould take place. For he is there expre&s;sly &s;peaking of the kingdom of heaven; and matters thereunto per|taining. And by the kingdom of heaven, in the go&s;|pel is commonly meant, the new kingdom of Chri&s;t be|gan here in grace, to be perfected in glory. Thus John the bapti&s;t, came preaching; <Q>&s;aying repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</Q> Matt. 3.2. And again, <Q>from that time Je&s;us began to preach and &s;ay repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</Q> Matt. 4.17. That is, the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is ju&s;t about to be introduced. So here in the 18th of Matt. the di&s;ciples &s;aid to Je&s;us; "Who is the greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven?" V. 1&s;t. Altho' as yet, they knew not what the form of Chri&s;t's church might be: Yet they were looking forward, in expectation of his &s;etting up a new kingdom upon earth. And therefore, having yet ambitious views cleaving to them; they in|quired who &s;hould be greate&s;t in &s;aid kingdom. And Je&s;us therefore, to convince them of the incon&s;i&s;tency of their ambitious views, with the nature of his new kingdom, <Q>called a little child unto him, and &s;et him
<PB N="11" REF="013360_0011_0F90F312CFB84EA8">in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;aid, verily I &s;ay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye &s;hall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Who|&s;oever therefore &s;hall humble him&s;elf as this little child, the &s;ame is the greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</Q> V. 2, 3, 4. Which has a plain reference to Chri&s;t's new kingdom of grace, teaching the ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of humility in all the &s;ubjects of that king|dom. And &s;o al&s;o it is very ob&s;ervable, that Chri&s;t took occa&s;ion from the little child which he called and &s;et in the mid&s;t of them; to &s;peak of his little ones, believing on him; who were to be the &s;ubjects of his new king|dom of grace. And that in regard to the offences, that might ari&s;e towards them either from the world, or even one among another. In regard to offences ari&s;ing from the world, Je&s;us &s;aid, <Q>but who&s;o &s;hall offend one of tho&s;e little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a mill&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the &s;ea. Wo unto the world becau&s;e of offences,</Q> &amp;c. v. 6, 7. <Q>Take heed &s;aid Je&s;us, that you de&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little ones.</Q> V. 10. And again, <Q>even &s;o it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h.</Q> V. 14. And &s;o in continuation of the &s;ame &s;ubject, it is added in the 15 v. <Q>Moreover if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault,</Q> &amp;c. Je&s;us had &s;poken before, in reference to offences ari&s;ing from the men of the world. That in regard to &s;uch, it were better for them that a mill&s;tone were hanged about their necks, &amp;c. Importing, that God him&s;elf, would be &s;everely avenged for his children upon them. But here Je&s;us proceeds to point out to his little ones, believing on him; how to deal with one another, in ca&s;e of offences falling out among them&s;elves; in his new kingdom of grace: In
<PB N="12" REF="013360_0012_0F90F313E3713630">plain reference to which he is &s;till &s;peaking. Whence it is clearly manife&s;t, that by the church is here meant Chri&s;t's church in his new kingdom of grace. Such as was that fir&s;t church of Chri&s;t &s;et up at Jeru&s;alem. And accordingly it is found in fact, that when the churches came to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline; all tho&s;e who con&s;orted to|gether to eat the Lord's &s;upper; did concur together, in putting away offenders. As in the in&s;tance of the ince&s;tuous Corinthian. St. Paul declared to that church, the mind and will of Chri&s;t about that matter. <Q>To deliver &s;uch an one unto Satan, for the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h, that the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us. Purge out therefore, &s;aid he, the old leaven that ye may be a new lump, as ye are un|leavened. For even Chri&s;t our po&s;&s;over is &s;acrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the fea&s;t, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wicked|ne&s;s; but with the unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth.</Q> 1 Cor. 5.5. &amp;c. Plainly importing, that the whole body of communicants, which eat the fea&s;t of the Lord's &s;upper together, were to concur, in purging out that old leaven of wickedne&s;s from among them; that they might be as a new and unleavened lump. Thus plainly is the church, to which the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline is committed, pointed out: Even &s;o plainly, that there can be no room for any but mere futile cavils about it.</P>
<P>In the next place then, we are to con&s;ider; whether the nature of the proof to be required, be &s;ufficiently pointed out. And to this purpo&s;e &s;ee Matt. 18.16. <Q>That in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q> Which to common &s;en&s;e, plainly imports, that the evidence of facts to a church; mu&s;t be &s;uch, as equals that credibility of a fact, which ari&s;es from the evidence of two or three credible witne&s;|&s;es.
<PB N="13" REF="013360_0013_0F90F3169CC5E010">And what that is, mu&s;t in the nature of things, be left in the brea&s;ts of the judges; in all trials whether ci|vil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical. As to witne&s;&s;es being &s;worn; it may be ob&s;erved; That in every eccle&s;ia&s;tical trial, the proce&s;s is carried on in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The &s;olemnity of which, is equal to the &s;olemnity of an oath in any civil court.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly con&s;idered, what is expre&s;sly taught in the go&s;pel; of crimes, judges and evidence re&s;pecting church government. And judge ye now, my hearers, your own &s;elves; whether the laws of Chri&s;t are not abundantly &s;ufficient, for all the purpo&s;es of church government; without the addition of any canon laws of human devi&s;ing? Cavilling di&s;puters indeed, may cavil &s;till. But mo&s;t certainly the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, does look upon the laws which he hath given for the government of his church, perfectly &s;uffi|cient for that purpo&s;e. Becau&s;e he expre&s;sly declares in his word; <Q>that the &s;criptures, which are given by in&s;piration of God;</Q> are &s;uch, <Q>that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</Q> 2. Tim. 3.16, 17. Plainly importing, that by the in&s;pired writings, the man of God may, as to laws and rules, be throughly furni&s;hed to every good work, and of con&s;equence, to all the duties of church government; without any &s;uperadded canons about the matter. And indeed if it be not &s;o, there is &s;uch a de|ficiency left in Chri&s;t's kingdom; infinitely the mo&s;t perfect of all kingdoms; as can never be made up; without a new revelation from heaven. Becau&s;e Je&s;us as King and head of the church, is the only lawgiver therein. Of whom it is written, <Q>the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will &s;ave us.</Q> I&s;ai. 33.22. In which high and noble capacity, all power in heaven and in earth,
<PB N="14" REF="013360_0014_0F90F316C53DFAE0">is given unto him. Who never commi&s;&s;ionated any of his &s;ervants; to &s;et forth any laws or rules in his king|dom; but only by his in&s;piration or direction. Yea, but hath laid in a prohibition in bar, to prevent any of his &s;ervants from attempting, to &s;et forth or teach the ob&s;ervance of any laws or rules in his church; but &s;uch as he him&s;elf hath commanded: As implied in the words of our text. So that if the laws of Chri&s;t be deficient; they mu&s;t, as to all human power and authority remain deficient to the end. And Chri&s;t's church, which he pur|cha&s;ed with his own blood, be left without laws &s;uffici|ent for its well being, order and government; expo&s;ed to the rage of a wicked world; and to inevitable di&s;order and confu&s;ion among them&s;elves. The very &s;uppo&s;ition of which, is a vile impeachment of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the glorious Lawgiver, on the holy hill of Zion: Of his wi&s;dom, as tho' incapable of giving laws &s;ufficient; or of his goodne&s;s, as tho' when capa|ble, he had not kindne&s;s enough for his church and people, to give them laws every way &s;ufficient for their well being. But as the Jewi&s;h church was &s;uffici|ently furni&s;hed with laws to all needful purpo&s;es by Mo|&s;es: Even much more is the go&s;pel church, by the laws of Chri&s;t. As plainly implied in that. Heb. 3.5.6. <Q>And Mo&s;es was verily faithful in all his hou&s;e as a &s;ervant.&mdash;But Chri&s;t as a &s;on over his own hou&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;e are we.</Q></P>
<P>But it has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that it is no argument of imperfection in the &s;criptures; that there is not yet &s;et forth therein, all the laws that are needful to the govern|ment of the church. Even as it is no argument of im|perfection in the &s;criptures, that the art of &s;urveying and navigation, are not taught therein. Ju&s;t as though the art of &s;urveying, was as e&s;&s;ential to the welfare and glory of Chri&s;t's kingdom; as the government and good
<PB N="15" REF="013360_0015_0F90F317715739C0">order of his church. How weak and ab&s;urd the compa|ri&s;on?</P>
<P>All &s;uch arts and &s;ciences as relate to the affairs of the kingdoms of this world, are within the reach of human inve&s;tigation. The&s;e therefore, are left to the inventi|on of men; under the guidance of a common pro|vidence. But as to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, it is intire|ly of a different kind: not of his world, but of a &s;pi|ritual, holy and heavenly nature. And therefore fur|ni&s;hed and provided with all needful light and in&s;truc|tion, by divine revelation.</P>
<P>Such my hearers, is the nature of church govern|ment pointed out in the go&s;pel; according to which, all the authority which is given for that purpo&s;e, is only of an executive nature, and that ve&s;ted in every particu|lar church. This is that order of church govern|ment, commonly called congregational. Which I have been aiming to teach, and practi&s;e. To which my con&s;cience is bound by the word of God. And by which I mean, thro' the grace of God, firmly to abide; as not doubting the approbation thereof by the great Judge of all.</P>

<P>HENCE it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ider the commands of Chri&s;t; more e&s;pecially re&s;pecting the government of his church. Whether the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has in|deed given laws to his church. &s;ufficient for the go|vernment thereof? Not &s;o, but that circum&s;tances of time and place, &amp;c. are left di&s;cretionary. But &s;o <HI>&s;uf|ficient,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="013360_0016_0F90F31B2F2BB6D0">as not to need the addition of any canon laws or rules of human devi&s;ing. The affirmative &s;ide of which I have a&s;&s;umed; in direct oppo&s;ition to that ne|gative part, which has of late been &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly urged. As a counter part to which, the laws of Chri&s;t, as &s;et forth in the go&s;pel, re&s;pecting this matter, have been particularly con&s;idered. Whence it hath been made clearly to appear, that the crimes cognizable, who the judges are, how cau&s;es are to be introduced, what pe|nalties are to be inflicted, and the nature of proof to be required; are all pointed out in the &s;criptures, with &s;o much plainne&s;s and preci&s;ion, as to be fully &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of church government; without the addition of any human canons for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And now in reply to the many things, that have been held forth in vindication of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I &s;hall endeavour &s;o far as my memory &s;erves me, at a true repre&s;entation. And if any e&s;&s;ential mi&s;|take &s;hould be made, I promi&s;e to retract it; when e|ver it &s;hall be clearly manife&s;ted. For we do not, how|ever much hath been injuriou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted to the con|trary, arrogate all wi&s;dom and grace to our&s;elves; never pretending to judge others of any &s;ect, as to their &s;piri|tual &s;tate: but leaving every man in that re&s;pect, to &s;tand or fall to his own Ma&s;ter. It is only with their errors, manife&s;ted forth in words and in deeds, that we are concerned.</P>
<P>It was urged, you may remember, as a matter mani|fe&s;t in fact, that the laws of Chri&s;t are not &s;ufficient, for the purpo&s;e of church government; without the ad|dition of human canons; in that the chri&s;tian world have been &s;o divided about this matter; and have a|dopted &s;o many different forms of church government. Which, it is not &s;uppo&s;able, they would ever have done, had Chri&s;t's laws been &s;ufficient to that purpo&s;e. But
<PB N="17" REF="013360_0017_0F90F31B54115828">by this way of arguing, it mu&s;t al&s;o be concluded, that there is no certain &s;cheme of doctrine, &s;ufficiently &s;et forth in the &s;criptures. Becau&s;e the chri&s;tian world are &s;o divided about the great doctrines of religion. A way of arguing, which leads directly to that fundamen|tal maxim of dei&s;m, That human rea&s;on is the be&s;t guide in matters of religion. Such are the pitiful &s;hifts, which even men of &s;en&s;e betake them&s;elves unto, when driven off the &s;cripture ground.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o urged, that authority to exerci&s;e eccle&s;i|a&s;tical di&s;cipline is not committed to, or inve&s;ted in a particular church. Becau&s;e it is obvious to common &s;en&s;e, that churches are made up of very un&s;uitable judges in &s;uch matters: as including women, children, &s;uperannuated and prejudiced members. And yet, it was allowed, that ca&s;es of &s;candal ought to be fir&s;t tri|ed in particular churches, where they fall out; and if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ettled by them. But what gro&s;s incon&s;i&s;ten|cy is this? To &s;ay that the churches are not, according to common &s;en&s;e, &s;uitable judges. And yet, that ac|cording either to rea&s;on or &s;cripture, it does belong to them to judge fir&s;t in the ca&s;e. Baptized children, it was &s;aid, belong to the church. True, they do &s;o. But under the wing of their parents, who act for them, until they come of age capable of acting for them&s;elves. And if then, they do not come as de&s;ciples of Je&s;us to eat the Lord's &s;upper, they can have nothing to do, accord|ing to the &s;criptures in receiving or rejecting others.</P>
<P>But women al&s;o belong to the church, true. And according to the &s;criptures, females have as good a right as male-members, to be &s;atisfied of the grounds of charity for tho&s;e, with whom they commune in the &s;upper; and as good a right to the redre&s;s of all their grievances. If therefore, they cannot &s;ilently concur, with what the male-members act, they have mo&s;t cer|tainly
<PB N="18" REF="013360_0018_0F90F31EB0274540">a right &s;ome way, to make known their griev|ance.</P>
<P>As to prejudiced members, that ought not to be &s;uf|fered, they need to be fir&s;t taken care of and reclaimed.</P>
<P>And as to ignorant and &s;uperannuated members; there are none, that are capable of examining them&s;elves and di&s;cerning the Lord's body; as the &s;criptures re|quire of all that eat the Lord's-&s;upper; but that are able al&s;o, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wi&s;er members, to judge about matters of fact. So that when &s;uitable care is taken, about the admi&s;&s;ion of members; churches un|der the guidance of their pa&s;tors, are much better judg|es re&s;pecting &s;uch matters as are cognizable before them, than the jury in civil courts often are, in re&s;pect to many intricate ca&s;es laid before them. But it has been urged, that if eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority be ve&s;ted only in parti|cular churches; then there can be no dealing with an elder: but he mu&s;t be left without controul, an ab&s;o|lute pope. And it is indeed, no wonder, &s;hould this &s;eem to &s;ome a very weighty objection. But that it &s;hould &s;eem &s;o to any, that read the go&s;pel with atten|tion, is quite &s;trange. Becau&s;e it is &s;o plain in the go&s;|pel, that he that runs may read; that there was a plu|rality of elders, in every of the primitive churches. See Act. 14.23. <Q>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fa&s;ting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.</Q> Before they had elders ordained; the a|po&s;tles had the over&s;ight and care of them: But now having ordained them elders; they commended them to the Lord, to be under his care and direction; and not under any other juridical authority under heaven. Accordingly we read of <Q>Elders in the church at Jeru|&s;alem; of the elders of the church at Ephe&s;us,</Q> &amp;c. Which elders were to govern, not of them&s;elves juridi|cally;
<PB N="19" REF="013360_0019_0F90F31F09E4D258">but with the concurrence of the church over which they pre&s;ided. Hence it is written, <Q>Obey them that have the rule over you and &s;ubmit your|&s;elves; for they watch for your &s;ouls as they that mu&s;t give account.</Q> Heb. 13.17. It was tho&s;e that watched for their &s;ouls; that had the rule over them. When one elder therefore tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, the church with their remaining elders, or elder, might deal with the elder offending; as well as with any other mem|ber. Now though a plurality of elders, be not ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to the being of a true church; yet, where there is this deficiency of elders, if the one that is, of|fends, the deficiency in the nature of things, by fair deduction from the word, is to be &s;upplied; by calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of neighbouring elders; not to rule of them&s;elves juridically; but even as their own elders, in concurrence with the church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence al&s;o it may be inferred, That it is agreeable to the go&s;pel plan, that in judicial trials in a church, in which there is but one elder, neighbouring elders &s;hould be called in, to make a plu|rality or pre&s;bytery, unitedly to pre&s;ide, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and act in concurrence with the church, even as the plurality of elders did in the fir&s;t go&s;pel churches.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But we have been referred to the 15th chap. of the Acts for &s;omething like a juridical judgment of council. Excepting which, there was nothing pleaded, from the form of that council; nor upon any other grounds thro' the whole di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ociated, rather than congregational councils. But as to the council &s;poken of in that chapter. It is certain, it was nothing like the form of pre&s;ent con&s;ociated councils. As it con&s;i&s;ted only of the apo&s;tles that were at Jeru&s;a|lem, with the elders of, together with that whole church. For Paul and Barnabas that carried the que&s;tion; do not appear to have acted in council. The bu&s;ine&s;s of which council, was not any cau&s;e of di&s;cipline: But a
<PB N="20" REF="013360_0020_0F9051934D46A2C8">que&s;tion of con&s;cience, about the mind and will of Chri&s;t; re&s;pecting the rites to be ob&s;erved in the Gentile churches. And unto the apo&s;tles, it did in a &s;pecial man|ner appertain, as in&s;pired men, to declare the mind and will of Chri&s;t in that matter, and accordingly their de|termination, is &s;et forth in the &s;criptures; as a part of the law of Chri&s;t, given by in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t: Binding upon his churches through all gene|rations.</P>
<P>But the preacher pleaded, in order to make out that their judgment, was a precedent ju&s;tifying the juridical judgment of ordinary councils; that its being &s;aid, it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t and to us, &amp;c. does not imply, that &s;aid judgment was of divine in&s;piration, any more than all rational conclu&s;ions, that are obtained by a common concurrence of the &s;pirit. And to make out, that it was really no more of divine in&s;piration; it was argued, that the council conferred and rea&s;oned toge|ther upon the &s;ubject. So that the determination was merely of rea&s;on and not of divine in&s;piration. A very notable conclu&s;ion indeed, for a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel!</P>
<P>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, declares in his word, <Q>That all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</Q> 2 Tim. 3.16. But lo, here comes one in his name: declaring, that this part of &s;cripture, the determination of the apo&s;|tles in the 15th chap. of the Acts; was not, by in&s;pira|tion of God. Shocking! to all that revere the bible as the book of God! For by this way of arguing, all tho&s;e &s;criptures, wherein the &s;acred penmen u&s;ed rea&s;on|ing and argumentation; mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide, as not be|ing by in&s;piration of God. Which lands us directly among&s;t the chri&s;tian dei&s;ts, as they are called. Thus according to this preacher, the &s;criptures are not only deficient to the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of Chri&s;t's church and kingdom; but even the &s;criptures which we have, are
<PB N="21" REF="013360_0021_0F90F31FD5335A58">in danger of being entirely invalidated. But what now would you &s;ay, my hearers, if this pretended patron for the Say-Brook platform; &s;hould be found by his &s;cheme, removing the very foundation corner &s;tone of that &s;ame platform? The very &s;uppo&s;ition, you will doubtle&s;s imagine, mu&s;t &s;urely be without the lea&s;t foundation. But let the matter be fairly con&s;idered. And then, judge ye, your own&s;elves, if it be not mo&s;t glaringly manife&s;t?</P>
<P>And here, you will be plea&s;ed carefully to bear in mind, that leading propo&s;ition, the grand hinge upon which the whole di&s;cour&s;e turned: That the laws of Chri&s;t, are not &s;ufficient for the government of his church. Not merely as to circum&s;tances of time, place, &amp;c. But not even as laws; without the addition of canon laws and rules of human devi&s;ing. And with this full in view, be plea&s;ed to hear what the platform &s;aith, in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith. Chap. 1&s;t. art. 6th. are the&s;e words, <Q>The whole coun&s;el of God concern|ing all things nece&s;&s;ary for his own glory, man's &s;al|vation, faith and life is either expre&s;sly &s;et down in &s;cripture, or by good and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence may be deduced from &s;cripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the &s;pirit, or traditions of men.&mdash;There are &s;ome circum&s;tances, concerning the wor&s;hip of God and government of the church, common to human acti|ons and &s;ocieties, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and chri&s;tian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be ob&s;erved.</Q> Now in what &s;en&s;e the compilers of the platform, under&s;tood this article, and how they meant to act in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with it, even in re|gard to tho&s;e very rules which they compiled; appears from their own words; as in the preface to the confe&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="22" REF="013360_0022_0F90F3207593FCF8">of faith. Where they expre&s;s them&s;elves thus: <Q>That you be immoveably and unchangeably agreed in the only &s;ufficient, and invariable rule of religion; which is the holy &s;cripture the fixt canon, uncapable of addition or dimunition. You ought to account nothing antient, that will not &s;tand by this rule, nor any thing new that will. Do not hold your&s;elves to un&s;criptural rites in religion, wherein cu&s;tom it &s;elf doth many times mi&s;guide. Believe it to be the ho|nour of religion to re&s;ign and captivate our wi&s;dom and faith to divine revelation. That you be deter|mined by this rule in the whole of religion.</Q> Thus &s;pake the compilers of the platform. A language as diametrically oppo&s;ite, to that of the late preacher, as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t. And &s;o again, in the preface to the heads of agreement. They expre&s;s them&s;elves thus, <Q>There is no con&s;titution on earth hath ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;uch &s;ure foundations, nor &s;o fully provided for its &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, as the church of God, it being built on the prophets and apo&s;tles, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone. The wi&s;|dom of our Lawgiver, King, and Judge, who alone hath the original &s;overeignty of giving being to, and laying the foundations of the church, and who&s;e only is the legi&s;lative power therein, hath given &s;uch am|ple rights and privileges to the church, and &s;uch ex|cellent rules for its government, as are inviting to &s;trangers like a city &s;et on a hill.</Q> Mo&s;t excellently expre&s;&s;ed. As full to our purpo&s;e, in direct oppo&s;ition to the late &s;ermon, as words can be.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e venerable fathers therefore, never meant to &s;et forth any rules of church di&s;cipline; but &s;uch only, as were in the plain &s;en&s;e thereof, in their view, evidently contained in the &s;criptures. Even as they them&s;elves expre&s;sly declare; in this &s;ame preface. Saying, <Q>For
<PB N="23" REF="013360_0023_0F90F32131398C18">the healing our wounds, a more explicit a&s;&s;erting the rules of government <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> provided in the holy word, hath been thought highly expedient.</Q> Thus they never meant to make any new rules; but only more explicitly to &s;et forth &s;uch rules, as they &s;uppo&s;ed were &s;ufficiently provided in God's word. Whence they an|nexed &s;cripture texts to every article for the proof there|of, though very impertinent to the main point; as might ea&s;ily be made to appear. The unhappy mi&s;take, there|fore, which attended them about the matter was really this: That they &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome things about church government, to be contained in the &s;criptures, which really are not to be found there.</P>
<P>And &s;o dubious it &s;eems, did the matter appear even to them&s;elves, as not to imagine, they had certainly hit upon the right &s;cripture plan. Whence they recom|mended the rules which they &s;et forth, in the following words: <Q>Hoping till it plea&s;e the Lord, to &s;end forth further light and truth in the&s;e more controver&s;ial matters, this method may be a ble&s;&s;ed means of our better unanimity,</Q> &amp;c. Further light and truth they did not expect by any new revelation from heaven; but by a clearer under&s;tanding of that already given.</P>
<P>Whence it appears very manife&s;t, that we who can|not find, the &s;en&s;e of the articles of di&s;cipline, to be con|tained in the &s;criptures; do act perfectly agreeable to the fundamental leading &s;entiments of the compilers them|&s;elves, even in rejecting tho&s;e very articles which they compiled. And indeed upon their own principles, they mu&s;t certainly have approved of us, as acting therein perfectly right.</P>
<P>But it is really very que&s;tionable, if they would have admitted any, holding &s;uch &s;entiments, as &s;et forth in the late &s;ermon; &s;o much as to communion with them in any of their churches: much le&s;s to rank among them
<PB N="24" REF="013360_0024_0F90ECAAAD9422F8">as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel: For the primitive fathers of New-England, were extremely aver&s;e to that doctrine, of the in&s;ufficiency of the &s;criptures, as a rule of church government; held forth in the leading propo&s;ition of &s;aid &s;ermon. As well knowing that to be the gap, thro' which at fir&s;t entered, and by which there was great danger of being again introduced, all the &s;uper&s;titions, rights and fooleries of the church of Rome. With a &s;pecial view therefore, to adhere to the &s;criptures, as the only rule of faith and di&s;cipline, it was, that they left all the plea&s;ant accommodations of their native country; for this then howling wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But how &s;trange! How marvelous &s;trange and a&s;to|ni&s;hing! that a man of &s;en&s;e &s;hould come to us, as in the name of the Lord, publickly to reprove and rebuke this church; for rejecting a comparitively &s;mall part of the Say-Brook platform! While he him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time was endeavouring, by a &s;et di&s;cour&s;e, to remove the very foundation corner &s;tone of that &s;ame platform! Yea, and to &s;trike away the main pillar; which in the view of the compilers, was de&s;igned to &s;upport the whole! Be a&s;toni&s;hed ye heavens, and wonder O earth at this! Let the world &s;ay, was there ever &s;uch effron|tery; &s;uch daring barefaced effrontery; tran&s;acted be|fore towards any church in America? If this par&s;on be not, for his heretical &s;entiments, publickly delivered in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome of their own members; called to an account and cha&s;ti&s;ed by the council that &s;ent him; let all that hear of the&s;e matters judge, if they do not ju&s;tly de&s;erve to rank with tho&s;e, of whom our Lord &s;aid, "ye blind guides, which &s;train at a gnat and &s;wal|low a camel?"</P>
<P>But to pave the way for our rebuke, it was very &s;hrewdly noted, that the apo&s;tles never denied the juri&s;|diction of the Jewi&s;h courts, before which they were
<PB N="25" REF="013360_0025_0F90ECAB6DE56F78">called. Notably pertinent indeed! If it be con&s;idered, that they ab&s;olutely denied obedience, to their unrighte|ous commands. Saying, <Q>we ought to obey God ra|ther then men.</Q> On whom then, does the de&s;igned reproach rebound?</P>
<P>But the &s;tre&s;s of the reproof was laid upon this, That we renounced the con&s;ociated connection without a&s;king leave. As tho' we had no right to do it, without a&s;king. And if no right without a&s;king; &s;urely none without leave given. But if un&s;criptural connections, ought not to be renounced, without a&s;king, and obtaining leave; all the prote&s;tant churches on earth, mu&s;t have been to this day, in &s;ubjection to the Pope. For &s;urely his pretended holine&s;s, would never have con&s;ented to be &s;o for&s;aken. And that for this very important rea&s;on: Becau&s;e it could not, upon his principles, be for the good of the churches.</P>
<P>But we were rebuked for not a&s;king leave of them, the con&s;ociation. And who are they? Lords over us? Yea, let all that hear thereof judge, if in their conduct towards us, they are not lording it over God's heritage?</P>
<P>But to compleat the farce, we have been charged with breach of covenant, in renouncing connection.</P>
<P>But was there ever any expre&s;s covenanting about the matter? Was not the connection practically fallen in with, merely as cu&s;tom led the way? And certainly then, to be practically renounced, as &s;oon as found to be un&s;criptural.</P>
<P>But you have been twitted of unkindne&s;s, in what you have done: After all he great and good things which con&s;ociated councils have done for you. But &s;urely all tho&s;e &s;ame purpo&s;es, &s;o far as needful, might have been done for you full as well; by congregational councils; without ever having been obnoxious to their rebuke; for adhering to the &s;criptures, or for renouncing un&s;criptural connections, without a&s;king their leave.</P>

But it is worthy &s;pecial remark, that there were no arguments offered, nor even attempted to be offered, di|rectly to vindicate that very juridical authority; given to con&s;ociated councils in the articles of di&s;cipline; with a &s;pecial view to which it was, that we renounced con|nection. So that after all, the very e&s;&s;ence of the great labouring point, was not &s;o much as once pertinently touched. Our great crime therefore, of which we have been admoni&s;hed to repent: When we come to the bottom of the matter; con&s;i&s;ts only in this, that the church were not fully agreed.

And now defended publickly that the Pope is not by divine right head of the church; yet I did not &s;ee what naturally fol|loweth thence, viz. that the Pope is therefore of nece&s;&s;ity of the devil; for what is not of God, is nece&s;&s;arily of the devil.

If therefore any of you, my hearers, that were the de|&s;igned &s;ubjects of that lordly rebuke, have been ready, as I&s;&s;achars, to crouch down under the burden. You mu&s;t needs doubtle&s;s begin to feel a &s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in your own brea&s;ts; that you have been &s;hamefully faint hearted in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. Far from that un|&s;haken con&s;tancy, and noble magnanimity, which be|comes good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Captain of our &s;alvation. Wherefore &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what the mind and will of Chri&s;t really is, about the&s;e matters. And knowing his will, take up your cro&s;s and follow him. And be ye &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable in your &s;ub|jection and obedience to all his commands. Standing fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made you free. That overcoming all the temptations, that may be found in your way, thro' this evil world: you may finally at|tain, to &s;it down with Chri&s;t in his throne: Even as he al&s;o overcame, and is &s;it down with his father in his throne.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e of you, my hearers, who affect to be neu|ters in the&s;e matters, it &s;tands you in hand, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, whether it be at all probable, that the different &s;chemes of church government contended for, can be e|qually agreeable to the mind and will of Chri&s;t. And if not, it mu&s;t certainly concern you, as well as others, to &s;ee on which &s;ide the truth lies: And to embrace it with firmne&s;s, and to follow it with con&s;tancy and dili|gence. For lukewarmne&s;s and indifferency in matters pertaining to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, agree not to the character of his true and faithful di&s;ciples and followers. But as to tho&s;e of you, my hearers, who are taken with a great liking to the late di&s;cour&s;e; it is a very pitiful dilemma, that you are fallen into.

And even that grand pillar, the doctrine of the &s;ufficiency of &s;cripture, as a rule of church di&s;cipline, upon which the venerable compilers of the platform meant to erect the whole. And &s;o while you pretend a very great re|gard for them, yet really renounce the very foundation on which they meant to build.

My heart's de&s;ire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be led into all truth; and that you may be perfect in all the will of God; built up in faith and holine&s;s; ble&s;&s;ed with a part in all the ble&s;&s;ings of the kingdoms of grace here. And that you and I, and all that hear me this day, may, thro' the power and grace of God in Chri&s;t, finally attain to the world of perfect harmo|ny, peace, and love, to the everla&s;ting prai&s;e of his ho|ly name.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF VIEW Of the &s;cripture texts &s;ubjoined to &s;ome of the mo&s;t exceptionable articles in the Say-Brook platform; &s;hewing them to be very impertinent to the purpo&s;e of con&s;ociated connection and authority.</HEAD>
<P>"ARTICLES for the admini&s;tration of church di&s;cipline, &amp;c. Say-Brook, Sept. 9, 1708." Mo&s;t certainly it is highly rea&s;onable to be expected, that the&s;e articles compiled by &s;o learned a council, &s;hould be &s;upported by the mo&s;t pertinent proof to be found in the bible. But altho' this was a truly venerable council, yet as general councils have often erred, this council might very po&s;&s;ibly err al&s;o. Who&s;e decrees therefore, are not to be received with an implicit faith. But it be|comes us freely to examine and impartially to judge every one for our&s;elves, whether they are well &s;upported by the &s;acred &s;criptures, according to which they ought to &s;tand or fall.</P>
<P>Article 1&s;t. <Q>That the elder or elders of a particu|lar church, with the con&s;ent of the brethren of the &s;ame, have power and ought to exerci&s;e church di&s;ci|pline according to the rules of God's word, &amp;c.</Q>
<PB N="30" REF="013360_0030_0F905194A32F5EB8">This article is &s;o entirely agreeable to the heads of agree|ment, and the &s;cripture &s;ubjoined &s;o pertinent, that there needs no &s;pecial ob&s;ervations to be made upon it.</P>
<P><Q>Article 2d. That the churches, which are neigh|bouring each to other, &s;hall con&s;ociate for mutual affording to each other &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as may be re|qui&s;ite, upon all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical. And that the particular pa&s;tors and churches, within the re&s;pec|tive counties in this government &s;hall be one con&s;oci|ation (or more if they &s;hall judge meet) for the end afore&s;aid.</Q> P&s;al. 122, 3, 4, 5, and 133.8. Eccl. 4, 9, to 12. Acts 15, 2, 6, 22, 23. 1. Tim. 4, 14. 1 Cor. 16, 1. Let us &s;ee then the propriety of the&s;e texts: To prove that there ought to be &s;uch a con&s;o|ciation of the churches; P&s;al. 122, 3, 4, 5. <Q>Jeru&s;a|lem is built as a city, it is compact together; whether the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the te&s;|timony of I&s;rael, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are &s;et thrones of judgment; the thrones of the hou&s;e of David.</Q> Spoken in reference to the orders given under the Mo&s;aic oeconomy, for all the tribes of I&s;rael to repair to the hou&s;e of the Lord, the temple in Jeru&s;alem, both for wor&s;hip and al&s;o for judgment in all difficult matters. Agreeable to Deut. 16.6. and 17.8. But what is that to the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e? Is it to be imagined that the thrones of judgment at Jeru&s;alem, were typical of, or any how pointed at the con&s;ociation of go&s;pel churches; to be as thrones for all parties to repair to for judgment? No &s;urely. See al&s;o P&s;al. 133, 1. <Q>Behold how good and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</Q> And is this any rea&s;on for the con&s;ociation of churches? Does it not plead as pertinently for the unity of all churches, in the Bi&s;hop of Rome the pretended vicar of Chri&s;t? Or may it not be as forcibly pleaded by the
<PB N="31" REF="013360_0031_0F90F323E62D6830">church of England, for the unity of all the churches in the kingdom in their hierarchy? See al&s;o Eccl. 4.9, to 12. <Q>Two are better than one, becau&s;e they have a good reward of their labour: For if they fall the one will lift up his fellow: But wo unto him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up,</Q> &amp;c. Thus the royal preacher &s;ets forth (in oppo&s;ition to the nigardly mi&s;er, of whom he had been &s;peaking) the peculiar benefit and advantage of &s;ocial life. But what is this to the con&s;ociation of churches? Or at lea&s;t, what &s;tronger plea does it af|ford for the combination of churches according to the articles, than according to the model of the church of England, or even the church of Rome? But let us at|tend to Acts 15.2, 6, 22, 23. <Q>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no &s;mall di&s;&s;en&s;ion and di&s;pu|tation with them, they determined that Paul and Bar|nabas and certain others of them, &s;hould go up to Jeru&s;alem, unto the apo&s;tles and elders about this que&s;tion.</Q> (Whether the gentile converts ought to be circumci&s;ed after the manner of Mo&s;es.) <Q>And the apo&s;tles and elders came together to con&s;ider of this matter.&mdash;Then plea&s;ed it the apo&s;tles and elders with the whole church, to &s;end cho&s;en men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas.&mdash;And wrote letters by them,</Q> &amp;c. Thus the church at Antioch, in a di&s;&s;en&s;ion that aro&s;e among them about circumci&s;ion, &s;ent up a que&s;tion about that matter, by the hands of Paul and Barnabas, to the apo&s;tles and el|ders that were at Jeru&s;alem, to be determined and &s;ettled by them. A que&s;tion of great importance, re&s;pecting the church of Chri&s;t through all generations. God therefore &s;aw fit, that it &s;hould be determined, not by any one, but by all the apo&s;tles and elders that were at Jeru&s;alem; whence the go&s;pel was to go forth unto the
<PB N="32" REF="013360_0032_0F90F32558BD7F00">nations. In the determination of which, they were fa|voured with the &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t. "For it &s;eemed good," &s;aid they v. 28, <Q>to the Holy Gho&s;t and to us,</Q> &amp;c. Thus the churches, while the apo&s;tles lived, looked to them to make known the mind and will of Chri&s;t. And now they are fallen a&s;leep, it is equally fitting to appeal to their writings for the deci&s;ion of every religious controver&s;y. For unto the apo&s;tles were committed in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, the keys of the kingdom. Math. 16.19. <Q>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and what|&s;oever thou &s;hall bind on earth &s;hall be bound in hea|ven; and what&s;oever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on earth &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven.</Q> Whereby is to be under&s;tood a power of binding and loo&s;ing doctrinally, i. e. by decla|ring the mind and will of Chri&s;t, binding upon the con|&s;cience. And agreeable hereto, <Q>Je&s;us breathed upon his apo&s;tles, and &s;aid unto them, receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t. Who&s;oever &s;ins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and who&s;oever &s;ins ye retain, they are retained.</Q> John 20.22, 23. Hence all the apo&s;tolic writings are binding upon con&s;cience: So as no unin|&s;pired writings can be. And in the proper exerci&s;e of this power it was, that the apo&s;tles, with the elders and church at Jeru&s;alem, decided the que&s;tion &s;ent from An|tioch about circumci&s;ion. Loo&s;ing the Gentiles there|from, but binding them, as &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, <Q>to ab&s;tain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,</Q> &amp;c. A power not to be claimed by any un|in&s;pired men, without daring pre&s;umption. The Pope indeed, who claims as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of St. Peter, the in|fallible a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t, challenges a right of determining all &s;uch matters. But far be it from pro|te&s;tants. See al&s;o 1 Tim. 4.14. <Q>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy,
<PB N="33" REF="013360_0033_0F90F325C7477AC8">with the laying on the hands of the pre&s;bytery.</Q> Thus there was it &s;eems a pre&s;bytery concuring in the ordination of Timothy. But there may be congregati|onal pre&s;byteries for that purpo&s;e; &s;uch as officiated in all ordinations in New England previous to the Say-Brook platform. We come then to the la&s;t text, under this article, 1 Cor. 16.1. <Q>Now concerning the col|lection for the &s;aints as I gave order to the churches of Galatia even &s;o do ye.</Q> Thus St. Paul gave di|rections to the Corinthian church, even as he had done before to the churches of Galatia, re&s;pecting a collection for the &s;aints. But what is this to the purpo&s;e of churches being con&s;ociated? As there were churches of Galatia, &s;o al&s;o there were churches of Connecticut without being con&s;ociated.</P>
<P><Q>Article 3. That all ca&s;es of &s;candal, that fall out within the circuit of any of the afore&s;aid con&s;ociations, &s;hall be brought to a council of the elders and al&s;o me&s;&s;engers of the churches within the &s;aid circuit, i. e. the churches of one con&s;ociation, if they &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end me&s;&s;engers, when there &s;hall be need of a coun|cil for the determination of them.</Q> 3 John v. 9, 10. 1 Cor. 16.1. Gal. 6.1, 2. 2 Cor. 13.2. Acts 15.23. 2 Cor. 8.23.&mdash;Let the&s;e texts now be attended to. 3 John v. 9.10. <Q>I wrote unto the church, but Diotre|phes who loveth to have preeminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will re|member his deeds, which he doth prating again&s;t us, with malicious words, and not content therewith nei|ther doth he him&s;elf receive the brethren, and forbid|eth them that would, and ca&s;teth them out of the church.</Q> There was it &s;eems great di&s;orders in the church, to which the apo&s;tle had a &s;pecial reference in this epi&s;tle; occa&s;ioned by one Diotrephes that con|ducted very tyrannically; whom therefore the apo&s;tle
<PB N="34" REF="013360_0034_0F90F32683CACF58">threatened to correct and cha&s;ti&s;e. But what is this to the purpo&s;e of con&s;ociated councils having the hearing of all ca&s;es of &s;candal that fall out within their circuit? Are they inve&s;ted with apo&s;tolic authority? None &s;urely will a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a pretence. See al&s;o 1 Cor. 16.1. <Q>Now concerning the collection for the &s;aints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, even &s;o do ye.</Q> Thus St. Paul gave direction to the churches of Galatia, concerning a collection. And does it there|fore follow, that con&s;ociated councils have a right to determine all matters of &s;candal, that fall out in the churches within their di&s;trict? How altogether wide of the purpo&s;e? The next is Gal. 6.1, 2. <Q>Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are &s;piri|tual, re&s;tore &s;uch an one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con&s;idering thy&s;elf, le&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted. Bear ye one anothers burdens and &s;o fulfil the laws of Chri&s;t.</Q> Here chri&s;tian brethren are expre&s;sly directed to re&s;tore one another. How directly contrary then, to the natural import of this text, to go about to infer from hence, agreeable to the article, that councils have a right to hear and judge in all ca&s;es of &s;candal? See al&s;o 2 Cor. 13.2. <Q>I told you before and foretel you as if I were pre&s;ent the &s;econd time, and being ab&s;ent, now I write to them which heretofore have &s;inned, and to all others that if I come again I will not &s;pare.</Q> And becau&s;e the apo&s;tle determined not to &s;pare &s;uitable reproof, does it thence follow, that councils have a right to judge offenders? Surely nothing of that na|ture. See al&s;o Acts 15.23. <Q>And wrote letters by them after this manner: The apo&s;tles and elders and brethren &s;end greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch,</Q> &amp;c. The apo&s;tles and elders &s;ent letters greeting, to the brethren at Antioch; but what is that to the purpo&s;e of councils judging ca&s;es of
<PB N="35" REF="013360_0035_0F90F3274D887E28">&s;candal? Next we have 2 Cor. 8.23. <Q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you, or our brethren be enquired of, they are the me&s;&s;engers of the churches and the glory of Chri&s;t.</Q> Here we have the name of me&s;&s;en|gers applied by St. Paul to &s;ome that were &s;ent by the churches, either to collect or to carry a collection for the &s;aints, of which the apo&s;tle was &s;peaking. But what &s;hadow of relation has that to me&s;&s;engers judging in ca|&s;es of &s;candal? Tho' yet according to the following article, the elders may judge and determine as well without them.</P>
<P>Article 4. <Q>That according to the common prac|tice of our churches nothing &s;hall be deemed an act or judgment of any council, which hath not the major part of the elders pre&s;ent concuring, and &s;uch a num|ber of the me&s;&s;engers pre&s;ent, as makes the majority of the council: Provided, that if any &s;uch church &s;hall not &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end any me&s;&s;engers to the coun|cil, or the per&s;ons cho&s;en by them &s;hall not attend, neither of the&s;e &s;hall be any ob&s;truction to the pro|ceedings of the council, or invalidate any of their acts.</Q> Acts 15.23. 1 Cor. 14.32, 33. Let us now &s;ee what relation the&s;e texts have to &s;uch a manner of determining judgment. Acts 15.23. <Q>And wrote letters by them after this manner: The apo&s;tles and elders and brethren &s;end greeting, unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.</Q> For as &s;aid in the preceding ver&s;e <Q>Then plea&s;ed it the apo&s;tles and elders with the whole church, to &s;end cho&s;en men of their own company to Antioch,</Q> &amp;c. Thus the text referred to, &s;peaks of the united concurrence of a whole body. But what is this to the purpo&s;e, of there being &s;o many me&s;&s;engers in a vote, as to make a majority of the council? The
<PB N="36" REF="013360_0036_0F90ECACEEA83AA8">only proper inference from hence would be, that there ought to be the united concurrence of the whole. See al&s;o 1 Cor. 14.32, 33. <Q>And the &s;pirits of the pro|phets are &s;ubject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confu&s;ion, but of peace as in all the churches of the &s;aints.</Q> Thus all things are to be conducted in the church, in an orderly manner. But what is this to the purpo&s;e of determining judgment ac|cording to the article? Can there be no order in the ca&s;e, but by a major part of the elders, and &s;o many me&s;&s;engers as to make a majority of the whole?</P>
<P>Article 5. <Q>That when any ca&s;e is orderly brought before any council of the churches, it &s;hall there be heard and determined, which (unle&s;s orderly removed from thence) &s;hall be a final i&s;&s;ue, and all parties therein concerned &s;hall &s;it down, and be determined thereby. And the council &s;o hearing, and giving the re&s;ult or final i&s;&s;ue, in the &s;aid ca&s;e as afore&s;aid, &s;hall &s;ee their determination, or judgment duly exe|cuted and attended, in &s;uch way and manner, as &s;hall in their judgment be mo&s;t &s;uitable and agreeable to the word of God.</Q> Acts 15. 1 Cor. 5.5. 2 Cor. 2.6, 11, and 13.2. Phil. 3.15. Rom. 14.2, 3.</P>
<P>In this we have the quinte&s;&s;ence of the matter, re&s;pect|ing the juridical authority of councils: Here the grand canon is erected. Here therefore the cleare&s;t proof is to be expected. Let the&s;e texts therefore be carefully attended to. Acts 15. Refering to the whole chapter, which as to the e&s;&s;entials of it, has been con&s;idered al|ready, under the 2d article. And there &s;hown to have no manner of relation to ordinary councils judging in ca&s;es of &s;candal. See then 1 Cor. 5.5. <Q>To deliver &s;uch an one unto Satan for the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h, that the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</Q> Here the church at Corinth, were directed
<PB N="37" REF="013360_0037_0F90F327F2537410">to ca&s;t out one of their own di&s;orderly members; which is altogether be&s;ide, yea even directly counter to, the purpo&s;e of juridical judgment to be given by a council. See then 2 Cor. 2.6, 11. <Q>Sufficient to &s;uch a man is this puni&s;hment which was inflicted of many. Le&s;t Satan &s;hould get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</Q> Plainly intimating, that the puni&s;hment inflicted upon the ince&s;tuous Corinthian, was done by the mutual concurrence of the many bre|thren of that particular church. But who can imagine that to be in any wi&s;e to the purpo&s;e of councils pa&s;&s;ing a juridical judgment upon offenders? It would &s;urely be much more pertinent hence to infer, that con&s;ociated councils have no concern in &s;uch matters. See al&s;o 2 Cor. 13.2. <Q>I told you before, and foretel you as if I were pre&s;ent the 2d time, and being ab&s;ent, now I write to them which heretofore have &s;inned and to all other, that if I come again I will not &s;pare.</Q> i. e. The apo&s;tle would not &s;pare &s;uitable reproof and rebuke to them that had &s;inned. But what is that to the juri|dical judgment of councils? It is &s;urely quite off the purpo&s;e. See al&s;o Phil. 3.15. <Q>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwi&s;e minded, God &s;hall reveal even this unto you.</Q> Thus St. Paul, profe&s;&s;ing for him|&s;elf as in the preceeding ver&s;e, <Q>to forget the things which are behind, to reach and pre&s;s forward towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t.</Q> Here exhorts all that are perfect in the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, to be thus practically minded, in the diligent pur&s;uit of the glorious prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t. As far from the purpo&s;e of juridical judgment, as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t. Attend then to Rom. 14.2.3. <Q>For one believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth herbs. Let
<PB N="38" REF="013360_0038_0F90ECADAE544A60">him that eateth de&s;pi&s;e him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him.</Q> But what is this to the purpo&s;e? Except it be to intimate that after all, this claim of juridical power, is a matter of as real indiffer|ance, as that of eating or not eating herbs? Which yet in truth it is not, unle&s;s more countenance can be found for it in the &s;criptures, than is contained in the texts here cited.</P>
<P>Article 6. <Q>That, if any pa&s;tor and church doth ob&s;tinately refu&s;e a due attendance and conformity to the determination of the council, that hath cognizance of the ca&s;e, and determineth it as above, after due pa|tience u&s;ed, they &s;hall be reputed guilty of &s;candalous contempt, and dealt with as the rule of God's word in &s;uch ca&s;es doth provide, and the &s;entence of non|communion &s;hall be declared again&s;t &s;uch pa&s;tor and church. And the churches are to approve of the &s;aid &s;entence, by withdrawing from the communion of the pa&s;tor and church, which &s;o refu&s;ed to be healed.</Q> Rom. 16.17. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion Gal. 2.11. to 14. 2 The&s;. 3.6, 14.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e texts now be attended to: Rom. 16.17. Now <Q>I be&s;eech you, brethren, mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;i|ons and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</Q> Here St. Paul be&s;eeches the brethren, called to be &s;aints in the church at Rome, to mark and avoid &s;uch among them&s;elves, as walked contrary to the go&s;pel; which has plainly no manner of relation to councils in any re&s;pect. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. <Q>Moreover if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es
<PB N="39" REF="013360_0039_0F90F32941360730">every word be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</Q> Here we have a plain direction given by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for every particular church, to ca&s;t out their own members refu&s;ing to hear them; which teaches nothing about con&s;ociated coun|cils declaring &s;entence of noncommunion, again&s;t &s;uch pa&s;tor and church as refu&s;e &s;ubjection to their decrees. The following texts, are &s;aid to be by proportion, i. e. like rea&s;on. Gal. 2.11. to 14. <Q>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I with&s;tood him to the face, be|cau&s;e he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles, but when they were come he withdrew, and &s;eperated him&s;elf, fearing them which were of the circumci&s;ion. And the other Jews di&s;&s;embled likewi&s;e with him; in&s;omuch that Barnabas al&s;o was carried away with their di&s;&s;imulation. But when I &s;aw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the go&s;pel, I &s;aid unto Peter before them all, if thou, being a Jew, live&s;t after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compele&s;t thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</Q> Here Paul reproved Peter a prevaricating kind of conduct, relative to the Jewi&s;h rites. But it does not appear, either that Paul in&s;i&s;ted upon, or that Peter made any acknowledgment in the ca&s;e. And yet neither is there the lea&s;t intimation, that Paul denounced &s;entence of noncommunion again&s;t Peter. What &s;hadow of proportion therefore there is in the ca&s;e, is not to be imagined; except it be in Peter's withdraw|ing and &s;eparating him&s;elf from the Gentiles: The very thing for which he was to be blamed. But further by proportion, &s;ee 2 The&s;. 3.6, 14. <Q>Now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<PB N="40" REF="013360_0040_0F90F329DDED1260">that ye withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. And if any man obey not our word by this epi&s;tle, note that man and have no com|pany with him, that he may be a&s;hamed.</Q> Here the brethren of the The&s;&s;alonian church, were expre&s;sly commanded to withdraw them&s;elves, from every bro|ther of theirs that walked di&s;orderly, in di&s;obedience to the apo&s;tolic word. Whence by plain proportion, it appears to be the duty of every particular church, to put away all &s;uch as walk di&s;orderly; in di&s;obedience to the word of truth. Which has no manner of relation to a council's declaring &s;entence of non communion with a pa&s;tor and church. And it is &s;urely very unrea&s;on|able, that arguments by proportion, &s;hould be &s;o far fetched in &s;uch weighty matters.</P>
<P>But now as the&s;e texts, &s;ubjoined to the &s;everal arti|cles that have been con&s;idered, are in no wi&s;e applicable to the proof and &s;upport thereof, it may fairly be pre|&s;umed, the bible affords none at all to that purpo&s;e. It is quite needle&s;s therefore, to proceed upon the remain|ing articles: Becau&s;e if the&s;e that have been con&s;idered, are void of &s;cripture &s;upport; the&s;e which are the main pillars, being left without any &s;cripture foundation, mu&s;t inevitably fall: And of con&s;equence the whole building tumble to ruin; and great will be the fall of it. And when once the emoluments annexed, are as thoroughly removed as the &s;criptures are from its &s;up|port, very &s;udden al&s;o will be the fall thereof.</P>
<P>It is obvious to any careful ob&s;erver, that a con&s;oci|ated council convened according to platform, thereby becomes a body inve&s;ted with &s;uch horns of power, as that whether&s;oever the body moves, thither the horns move al&s;o, inforcing their every act, judgment, coun|&s;el, opinion, or advice with binding authority. Which
<PB N="41" REF="013360_0041_0F90F32B4FE61950">being an un&s;criptural body, ought not therefore to be joined with, in any ca&s;e whatever.&mdash;The princes of this world indeed, have fought in almo&s;t all ages, to model the religion of the &s;tate to the civil polity. For a &s;tate religion has generally been deemed needful, even by heathen as well as by chri&s;tian &s;tates. And indeed in &s;ome re&s;pects, much more rea&s;onably by heathens than by chri&s;tians. Becau&s;e to the heathens, it &s;eemed a very plau&s;ible maxim, that every &s;tate had a right to model religion as they plea&s;ed; and of con&s;equence, that all the various members in particular, ought to be &s;ubject to the model which the &s;tate enjoyned. Whereas by divine revelation, religion is become a certain fixed and determinate matter: In no wi&s;e pliable to the devices of human policy, but ab&s;olutely binding upon every man's con&s;cience, according to what God him&s;elf hath enjoined. And therefore every individual, hath an ir|refragible right to &s;ee and judge for him&s;elf. And yet even chri&s;tian &s;tates, have more generally been endea|vouring, to accommodate the modes of religion to the model of civil polity. Mr. Bowers in his hi&s;tory of the Popes writes thus, <Q>The new form of government in|troduced (by Con&s;tantine the fir&s;t chri&s;tian Emperor) into the &s;tate, &s;erved as a model for the government of the church. That during the three fir&s;t centuries, each church was in a manner independant (for then pagani&s;m was the &s;tate religion) but in the fourth and following ages, great alterations were made in both, (church and &s;tate) the church adapting her govern|ment to that of the &s;tate.</Q> So al&s;o the hierarchy of the church of England, is adapted to the model of the civil monarchy. But whether there be not in &s;uch po|litical forms of religion, de&s;ignedly adapted to the model of the civil &s;tate, &s;omething more than a mere di&s;tant re&s;emblance of the image of the bea&s;t, that goeth into
<PB N="42" REF="013360_0042_0F90F32BC5C76A78">perdition; de&s;erves a very &s;erious con&s;ideration. As al&s;o, whether the model of church government &s;et forth in the Say-Brook articles, be not in &s;ome mea&s;ure framed in coherence with the model of the civil government? And whether &s;o far con&s;equently, it mu&s;t not partake of the &s;ame kind of obnoxiou&s;ne&s;s to the ju&s;t vengeance of heaven; with all other political models of religion? For every mode introduced into religion, a&s;ide from the &s;cripture rule, mu&s;t needs be at be&s;t, &s;uch wood, hay, and &s;tubble as &s;hall &s;urely be burnt up. <Q>Happy is he that condemneth not him&s;elf in that thing which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becau&s;e he eateth not of faith; for what&s;oever is not of faith, is &s;in.</Q> Who&s;oever therefore &s;ubmits to any model of church government, which Chri&s;t hath not ap|pointed, had need &s;ee to it in earne&s;t, how he will an&s;wer it to his great Judge, who will &s;hortly <HI>be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels; in flaming fire taking ven|geance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI></P>
<Q><P>I take it for granted, (&s;aith an elegant writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gent. Mag. July <HI>1772.</HI></NOTE>) that the religion of a chri&s;tian lies in the new te&s;tament; <HI>that</HI> is the great charter of our &s;alvation, and it is fully and completely &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;The de|ci&s;ions of <HI>&s;ynods, councils, convocations,</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;emblies</HI> of divines, are nothing to us, can be of no force or va|lue, nor of the lea&s;t importance to us as chri&s;tians, otherwi&s;e than as they are found, upon a candid exa|mination to agree with this rule.&mdash;Upon this <HI>founda|tion,</HI> namely, <HI>the &s;ufficiency of the &s;criptures,</HI> and <HI>the right of private judgment,</HI> the prote&s;tant cau&s;e is built.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which an account is given of the e&s;&s;ential facts, relative to the conduct of the con&s;ociated council, towards the pa&s;tor and fir&s;t church of Chri&s;t in Newtown.</HEAD>
<P>IN July, A. D. 1770, the pa&s;tor of &s;aid church pub|lickly declared, that he renounced that part of Say-Brook platform, intitled, Articles for the admini&s;tration of church di&s;cipline: as not being in his view, in the main thing therein aimed at, agreeable to the go&s;pel: And that if the church cho&s;e to take that for their rule of di&s;cipline, and in the ca&s;e impending, call in a coun|cil, which is a &s;uitable political expedient for &s;uch churches, as cannot be agreed among them&s;elves, about the &s;cripture plan of di&s;cipline; he would freely re&s;ign the work of the mini&s;try among them; who joined con&s;o|ciated councils no more. For which he gave his rea|&s;ons in public print.</P>
<P>With difficulty the church cho&s;e a me&s;&s;enger once afterwards to attend a con&s;ociated council. In the mean time the pa&s;tor had a friendly conference with two a&s;&s;o|ciations on that &s;ubject. And at a church meeting,
<PB N="46" REF="013360_0046_0F90F32E039B04F8">Aug. 16, A. D. 1773, it was propo&s;ed, whether this church mean to &s;tand in the con&s;ociated connection ac|cording to Say-Brook platform or not? Voted in the negative. But as &s;ome manife&s;ted a di&s;&s;atisfaction with &s;aid vote; upon their de&s;ire another meeting was &s;oon after warned to recon&s;ider the matter; and the Rev. Mr. Bartlet de&s;ired to preach upon that occa&s;ion. At a church meeting, Sept. 25, A. D, 1773. The Rev. Mr. Bartlet being pre&s;ent, was at the motion of the di&s;|&s;atisfied, de&s;ired by a vote of the church to officiate as moderator.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;ed,</HI> Whether it be the mind of this church to &s;tand in the con&s;ociated connection according to Say-Brook platform or not? Voted in the negative.</P>
<P>At a <HI>&s;ociety</HI> meeting al&s;o, &s;oon after called for that purpo&s;e: Propo&s;ed, Whether the &s;ociety would con|cur with the vote of the church renouncing con&s;ociated connection? Voted in the affirmative.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;ed al&s;o,</HI> Whether the &s;ociety would chu&s;e a com|mittee to call a council? Voted in the negative, very few it is &s;aid being on the affirmative &s;ide.</P>
<P>But a con&s;iderable number of individuals, according to common report, afterwards &s;igned a petition to the a&s;&s;oci|ation for their coun&s;el &amp; advice; which was pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;ociation at Ripton, after the council was adjourned. At a church meeting, Oct. 20, A. D. 1773, was read a circular letter from the church of Chri&s;t at Ripton, de&s;iring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this church by their pa&s;tor and me&s;&s;enger in ordaining a pa&s;tor over them; and Major John Chandler was cho&s;en to attend on that occa&s;ion. And when the ordaining council at Ripton was about to form, &s;aid pa&s;tor and me&s;&s;enger being pre&s;ent, &s;igni|fied, that he, &s;aid pa&s;tor and their church had renounced the con&s;ociated connection according to Say-Brook platform: And de&s;ired therefore to know, if the coun|cil
<PB N="47" REF="013360_0047_0F90ECAF2FBD7750">meant to act in the con&s;ociated form? For if &s;o, they could not con&s;i&s;tently join them. And as &s;ome of the leading members in&s;i&s;ted, they were called to be a coun|cil of, and meant to act in that form; &s;aid pa&s;tor and me&s;&s;enger refu&s;ed to join them; but continued pre&s;ent until the next evening. And no enquiries were made of the rea&s;ons of their conduct: But the next week, was delivered to &s;aid pa&s;tor, the following notification:</P>

<P>And we were al&s;o told by common fame, and no other way till the council met, that the council was adjourned to Newtown, on the la&s;t Tue&s;day of December; but pur&s;uant to &s;aid notification, a church meeting was warned and attended, and the matter laid before them for their con&s;ideration: And adjourned for a week: Met according to adjournment, when the following re|mon&s;trance was read and agreed to.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERCEIVING by the notification &s;ent by the coun|cil from Ripton, to me and to the church under my
<PB N="48" REF="013360_0048_0F90F32F70015A38">care, &s;igned Robert Ro&s;s, moderator, that the council have taken in hand, authoritatively to call me and my church to an account, for renouncing the con&s;ociated connection. And to reclaim us, as having already judged that we have done ami&s;s and ought to be re|claimed. The&s;e are therefore to inform you, though doubtle&s;s well knowing to it before, that years &s;ince I have publickly di&s;claimed and renounced the juridical authority of con&s;ociated councils; as &s;et forth in the Say-Brook articles of church di&s;cipline. For which I have given my rea&s;ons in public print, to which no fair reply hath been made. And have, as de&s;ired in a chri&s;|tian manner, by the con&s;ociation, held a friendly con|ference once and again with the a&s;&s;ociation on that &s;ub|ject; by whom I never yet could perceive any &s;ufficient rea&s;ons offered, to convince me of an error in that matter; nor even to per&s;uade me, as they them&s;elves &s;eemed inclin|ed chiefly to plead, that there was no very great or e&s;&s;enti|al difference, but am rather more &amp; more firmly per&s;uad|ed, the more I con&s;ider and weigh the &s;ubject, that the &s;aid con&s;ociated connection and authority is entirely void of any warrant, either by precept or example from the &s;acred oracles, by which my con&s;cience is entirely bound in matters pertaining to Chri&s;t's church and kingdom: Whereby I am in duty holden to reject all &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;|tical claims, as Chri&s;t hath given no warrant for in his word, as being of an antichri&s;tian nature. And when one of the Rev. elders of your own body was pre&s;ent at one of our church meetings, and by the de&s;ire of the di&s;|&s;atisfied, cho&s;en moderator thereof; at which meet|ing the con&s;ociated connection was a &s;econd time fairly voted out; &s;aid moderator, was by &s;ome of the leading members repeatedly and earne&s;tly urged, to produce &s;cripture warrant, if there was any, for the &s;upport of the con&s;ociated claims; that we might thereby, if we

<P>And that now after all this, the con&s;ociation &s;hould take upon them juridically to reclaim us, I &s;hall freely &s;ubmit to the publick to judge, whether it be not in fact a very &s;trange and unaccountable attempt.

<P>At a church meeting in Newtown, Nov. 17, A. D. 1773, propo&s;ed, whether agreeable to this church to concur with their pa&s;tor in the above written, as a &s;uita|ble return to be made by him, to the committee of the con&s;ociation, in reply to their notification to us, dated at Ripton, Oct. 27, 1773, &s;igned Robert Ro&s;s, mode|rator? Voted in the affirmative. Having in the exer|ci&s;e of that liberty to which we have a ju&s;t right as men and as chri&s;tians, renounced the con&s;ociated connection, from a real conviction, that the authority annexed thereto, by the articles of church di&s;cipline in the Say-Brook platform, is without any grounds for its &s;upport, either precept or example in the go&s;pel; and therefore
<PB N="50" REF="013360_0050_0F90519629F2E058">in point of duty ju&s;tly to be rejected. And as the con|&s;ociation have, is the exerci&s;e of that &s;ame authority, which we in obedience to God have renounced, taken upon them to reclaim us, as being already prejudged guilty by them; as appears by their notification to us, dated Ripton, Oct. 27, A. D. 1773, &s;igned Robert Ro&s;s, moderator. We therefore, cannot look upon our&s;elves under any obligations, either in point of duty or even of good manners, to pay any kind of obediential regard, to &s;uch un&s;criptural, u&s;urped authority over us. Tho' yet we &s;tand ready to render unto them and to all others a&s;king merely as chri&s;tians, the rea&s;ons of our proceed-dure; even as we have herein already briefly done.</P>
<P>At a church meeting in Newtown, Nov. 17, A. D. 1773, propo&s;ed, whether agreeable to the minds of this church, that the above written be pre&s;ented to the com|mittee of the con&s;ociation, as as &s;uitable return to be made by this church, to their notification, dated Rip|ton, Oct. 27, 1773? Voted with the concurrence of their pa&s;tor, in the affirmative.</P>
<P>The committee met according to appointment, and &s;ent to &s;aid pa&s;tor to de&s;ire his company or to appoint a time and place for a conference together. When the preceeding votes of the church were &s;ent in to them, with a line &s;ignifying that he would be very willing to wait upon them at his own hou&s;e when they plea&s;ed; which they did the next morning, and matters relative to their bu&s;ine&s;s freely conver&s;ed upon. In the after|noon was that &s;ermon preached, which was the occa&s;ion of the preceeding reply. The council met according to adjournment, but gave out no re&s;ult. The Rev. Mr. Baldwin preached, and gave a very &s;ea&s;onable word of exhortation, from Phi. 4.2. The a&s;&s;ociation took into con&s;ideration, a memorial that had been pre&s;ented, &s;igned by a number of the church and &s;ociety, &s;ignify|ing
<PB N="51" REF="013360_0051_0F905196E936A4D8">that the pa&s;tor and church had gone off from the foundation on which he was &s;ettled, praying their coun|&s;el and advice; which they gave out in the following form:</P>

<P><HI>An a&s;&s;ociation of the ea&s;tern di&s;trict of Fairfield county, met according to adjournment, at the hou&s;e of Dr. Thomas, in Newtown.</HI></P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ociation having carefully attended to the memorial from the aggrieved members of the church of Newtown, and heard what they had further to urge relative to their grievances; and having like|wi&s;e heard what the pa&s;tor and tho&s;e of the majority of the church &s;aw fit to reply.&mdash;Feel deeply affected with the melancholy &s;ituation of the church, and the great danger of a la&s;ting divi&s;ion therein. Which they appre|hend would be of fatal con&s;equence to both &s;ides. Are therefore of opinion, that all lawful mea&s;ures &s;hould be tried, to keep the church if po&s;&s;ible from a divi&s;ion, and think that under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of this place, 'tis e&s;pecially incumbent on both &s;ides to be of a moderate yielding di&s;po&s;ition; and to give up every thing they can con&s;i&s;tent with a good con&s;cience for the &s;ake of peace. We would there|fore earne&s;tly recommend it to the church and &s;ociety to recon&s;ider their votes, by which they have renounced their con&s;ociated connection with the neighbouring churches; and thereby relieve the con&s;ociation from the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of renouncing all further connec|tion with, and watchful care over the church of New|town. We de&s;ire they would con&s;ider, whether the ad|hering to that vote, will not lay them under many di&s;a|greeable inconveniencies? And whether it will not in all probability be productive of a divi&s;ion of the church? In the almo&s;t fatal con&s;equences of which, they that adhere to the vote, as well as the others mu&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="013360_0052_0F90F32F94AB07E8">deeply &s;hare. We would earne&s;tly recommend it to the Rev. Mr. Jud&s;on, to con&s;ider how far he can go, with|out violating tho&s;e principles in church government, which he thinks him&s;elf obliged in con&s;cience to adopt and act agreeable to, in order to re&s;tore peace to this di|vided church. Would the Rev. Mr. Jud&s;on be willing to continue in connection with the neighbouring church|es, attend their a&s;&s;ociations and con&s;ociations, his de|clining to act, when they find them&s;elves under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of acting deci&s;ively, (which is but &s;eldom the ca&s;e) we apprehend would make no breach between the con&s;ociation, and the pa&s;tor and church here. We heartily wi&s;h the Rev. Mr. Jud&s;on might continue his pa&s;toral relation to this church, if it may be without making a &s;chi&s;m in the body. But unle&s;s Mr. Jud&s;on and the church and &s;ociety can be prevailed upon to comply with the above advice, we are very doubtful whether this can be the ca&s;e. If Mr. Jud&s;on thinks he cannot comply thus, we would &s;till urge it upon the church and &s;ociety to re&s;cind their votes re&s;pecting con&s;o|ciational connection. And would advi&s;e the Rev. Mr. Jud&s;on to re&s;ign his pa&s;toral office (as he has manife&s;ted his willingne&s;s to do) in ca&s;e the majority of the &s;ociety and church &s;hould be willing to continue in con&s;ociated connection with the churches of this di&s;trict. We would al&s;o ob&s;erve to the church here, that we apprehend they imagine, the power of councils upon the Say-Brook platform to be greater than really it is: Be&s;ure greater than what is claimed by this con&s;ociation. As we do not &s;uppo&s;e but that every church will judge, whether they will receive the deci&s;ions of a council. And that their ob&s;tinate refu&s;al expo&s;es them only to a &s;entence of noncommunion in con&s;ociational connection; unle&s;s there be &s;candalous immorality or damnable here&s;y em|braced by the church; in which ca&s;e congregational
<PB N="53" REF="013360_0053_0F90F33042BFC7F8">churches at large, or even independent churches, mu&s;t renounce communion with &s;uch a church in all go&s;pel ordinances, le&s;t by &s;uch a communion they be partakers of their &s;in. We hope if the&s;e things are duly con&s;idered, the church and &s;ociety will be willing &s;till to continue their con&s;ociational connection. In ca&s;e this advice be complied with, we advi&s;e tho&s;e brethren that have been aggrieved with the conduct of the pa&s;tor and church, cheerfully to continue in the communion of the church, and to bani&s;h from their minds all hard thoughts and jealou&s;ies, they have entertained of their pa&s;tor and bre|thren. And we do exhort the&s;e brethren freely to meet with their pa&s;tor and brethren, to conver&s;e with them upon their unhappy difficulties, to labour to effect a re|conciliation upon the plan here propo&s;ed. But in ca&s;e the above advice &s;hould be wholly rejected by the church and &s;ociety, we would yet advi&s;e the aggrieved brethren not to &s;hun free conver&s;ation with the other, to &s;ee if they cannot come into &s;ome plan, in which they can with a good con&s;cience continue in communion toge|ther. For as we look upon it that a divi&s;ion of the church and &s;ociety, would be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, we can not advi&s;e to it, unle&s;s ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. But if after all the&s;e mea&s;ures have been taken, the aggrieved brethren think them&s;elves bound in con&s;cience to di&s;continue their communion with the other part of the church, we advi&s;e that they lay their grievances before a con&s;ociated council of this di&s;trict, to con&s;ider what relief it may be proper to grant them under their unhappy circum&s;tances. In the mean time we would advi&s;e them by all means &s;teadily to attend to Mr. Jud&s;on's preaching, and by no means neglect attending public wor&s;hip at the meeting-hou&s;e, till &s;uch time as they have the direction of the con&s;ociation in this affair.</P>

<P>Pur&s;uant to the above advice, a &s;ociety meeting was holden in Newtown, Jan. 12, A. D. 1774, propo&s;ed for vote, whether this meeting will agree, in matters of difficulty to call a council to advi&s;e and act with the &s;ociety and church, and vote with them in all &s;uch dif|ficult ca&s;es; and that this vote be preferred to the coun|cil for their approbation.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This vote, as &s;ome Gentlemen very &s;afely &s;ay, is what it is.&mdash;See note page <HI>19.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Voted in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Thus far, and no farther have matters hitherto pro|ceeded. Upon the proceedings of the council and a&s;&s;o|ciation, it is to be ob&s;erved, that we hear never a word of coun&s;el, direction or advice, by them given to the minor party, to endeavour to fall in quietly and peace|ably with the majority of the church and &s;ociety in their votes; as a matter of right, that ought to govern in all communities, even as a thing e&s;&s;ential to the orderly &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of every community; excepting where the rights of con&s;cience are violated. But few or none even of the council them&s;elves, it is pre&s;umed, would &s;ay, but that with a good con&s;cience, they could join in mem|ber&s;hip with a congregational church, were their dwel|ling fixed with &s;uch. Whereas had the council, from the beginning of clamorous complaints thrown in before them, urged advice of &s;uch a nature, in&s;tead of giving directions and going into mea&s;ures, which tended greatly to &s;trengthen and encourage ri&s;ing oppo&s;ition, but to terrify the feeble minded of the major party; no unpre|judiced per&s;on, that knows how the&s;e matters have been
<PB N="55" REF="013360_0055_0F905197A429CC18">agitated from the beginning, can entertain a rational doubt, but that this church with their pa&s;tor would ere now, have been in peace and quietne&s;s; a few individu|als excepted. But of the chri&s;tian propriety of &s;uch proceedings, it is freely &s;ubmitted to the public to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
