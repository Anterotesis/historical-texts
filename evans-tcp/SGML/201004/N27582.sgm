<HEAD>ANALYSIS OF The Report of the Committee OF THE VIRGINIA ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Legi&s;lature of Virginia, having, on the 21&s;t. December 1798, ordered certain re&s;olutions, cen&s;uring the admini&s;tration of the Federal Government, to be tran&s;mitted for the concurrence of the Legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, and receiving in its la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, pro|ceedings of &s;ome of the &s;tates on tho&s;e re&s;olutions un|favourable to their views, referred tho&s;e proceedings to a committee, and received a report, revi&s;ing, exami|ning, and ju&s;tifying the re&s;olutions, and &s;olemnly ad|hering to them, as true, con&s;titutional, and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions, embracing a variety of topics, if not intended, were well calculated, as a declaration of war by the &s;tate of Virginia again&s;t the government of the United States; and the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of them to the &s;e|veral &s;tates was well calculated to combine every &s;tate, under the plau&s;ible pretext of pre&s;erving the con&s;titu|tion, in a &s;y&s;tem of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Union. They
<PB N="4" REF="036760_0003_100AB14701A40F28">have no doubt an&s;wered part of the purpo&s;e they were intended to effect, in the elections of the &s;everal &s;tates; and the report now brings them forward, in their be&s;t &s;hape, to influence the Union in the election of a Pre&s;i|dent. The report, evidently the work of one man, is drawn up with great art and ingenuity. With &s;ome it may be doubtful whether it be the work of a candid mind ingenou&s;ly endeavouring to impre&s;s on others its own convictions; or the work of an ingenious mind uncan|didly endeavouring to per&s;uade others to believe what it believes not it&s;elf. Of the end which it pro&s;ecutes &s;uch is my opinion, that it cannot be pro&s;ecuted without a great &s;acrifice either of principle or of under&s;tanding. In this opinion I may perhaps have to claim, and ought therefore to give, much charitable allowance for the &s;teps by which an upright mind may be led to its own decep|tion: but the report will hardly claim apology from de|fect of under&s;tanding. In an&s;wers or refutations, a greater diffu&s;ion of &s;tyle is often requi&s;ite, than in the propo&s;itions which give ri&s;e to them. Much of the ori|ginal &s;ubject mu&s;t be repeated, to make the remarks on it intelligible. And &s;ome things, which yet may be doubted, cannot be more &s;hortly expre&s;&s;ed. If in the analy&s;is which I am about to undertake of the rea&s;oning in the principal points in this report, I can attain to any con&s;iderable degree of its cla&s;&s;ical brevity of expre&s;&s;ion, it is more than I expect, and all that I de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t. and 2d. re&s;olutions vindicated by the report profe&s;s a maintenance of the Con&s;titution, and an at|tachment to the Union of the United States. This is well, if it be &s;incere: but pro&s;e&s;&s;ions of this kind, put in, by way of prote&s;tation, that things in them&s;elves evil, may be con&s;trued as favourable as po&s;&s;ible, are fre|quently a preface to matter of very different tendency, and may perhaps be more ju&s;tly con&s;idered as ground of &s;u&s;picion, than means of ju&s;tification, of the principal matter.</P>
<P>The 3d. re&s;olution declarea <HI>"the powers of the Federal Government as re&s;ulting from the compact to which the &s;tates are parties, no farther valid, than they are authorized by the
<PB N="5" REF="036760_0004_100AB14883FE7218">grants enumerated in that compact; and that, in ca&s;e of a deli|berate, palpable, and dangerous exerci&s;e of other powers, the &s;tates, who are parties thereto, are bound to interpo&s;e, for main|taining within their re&s;pective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties, appertaining to them."</HI></P>
<P>Without controverting the ground on which this re&s;o|lution is &s;upported, or remarking on the vague terms in which it is couched, I &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s its main purport, <HI>that the &s;totes are bound to re&s;train within their limits the authority of the Federal Government.</HI></P>
<P>Among a variety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, of which the word <HI>&s;tates</HI> is &s;u&s;ceptible, the report adopts the following, as the &s;en&s;e in which it is to be under&s;tood in this re&s;olution: viz. <HI>the people in their highe&s;t &s;overeign capacity.</HI> This &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>&s;tates,</HI> the report ju&s;tly maintains, "becau&s;e, in this &s;en&s;e the con&s;titution was &s;ubmitted to the &s;tates: in this &s;en&s;e the &s;tates ratified it; and in this &s;en&s;e the &s;tates are parties to the compact from which the powers of the Federal Government re&s;ult." In this &s;en&s;e, there|fore, the word <HI>&s;tates</HI> is equivalent to <HI>the people of each &s;tate,</HI> who are parties to the compact of the Union expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution of the United States.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of the word &s;tates may be farther illu&s;tra|ted and &s;upported by comparing the con&s;titution with the confederation of the United States. The confede|ration was an act, not of the <HI>people</HI> of each &s;tate, but of the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> of each &s;tate. The delegates who framed it were cho&s;en not by the people, but by the Legi&s;lature of each &s;tate; it was ratified not by the people, but by the Legi&s;lature of each &s;tate; and the members of Con|gre&s;s who acted under it were cho&s;en not by the people, but by the Legi&s;lature of each &s;tate: it was an Union of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Governments,</HI> rather than of the <HI>people,</HI> of the &s;everal &s;tates; and the governments, not the people of the &s;e|veral &s;tates, were the parties to this compact. The dele|gates who framed the con&s;titution were, indeed, al&s;o cho&s;en by the Legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, becau&s;e they were cho&s;en under the confederation; but they framed the con&s;titution, not in the name of the Legi&s;la|tures,
<PB N="6" REF="036760_0005_100AB14ADCCA50C8">but of the <HI>people</HI> of the &s;everal &s;tates; and they fubmitted it to the ratification, not of the Legi&s;latures, but of the people of the &s;everal &s;tates. The people, not the Legi&s;latures, of the &s;everal &s;tates did ratify it, and made it their act. And the people, not the Legi&s;la|tures, of the &s;everal &s;tates, thus became parties to this compact, and choo&s;e members of Congre&s;s to act under it.</P>
<P>It appearing then, that the people of the &s;everal &s;tates are the parties to the compact in the con&s;titution, it will not follow that, becau&s;e the <HI>parties</HI> to a compact mu&s;t be the judges whether it has been violated, the <HI>Legi&s;latures</HI> of each &s;tate are the judges whether the con&s;titution has been violated. Yet this is the po&s;ition maintained by the re&s;olution; and, unle&s;s this po&s;ition be maintained, the re&s;olution fails. It &s;eems clear, that the rea&s;oning in the re&s;olution does not &s;upport it: and I know no rea|&s;oning that can &s;upport it. To give the rea&s;oning in the report its full force, it amounts to this, and to this only. The people of the &s;everal &s;tates in their &s;overeign capa|city are parties to the compact in the con&s;titution; every party to a compact may judge of its violation: the peo|ple of Virginia, in their &s;overeign capacity, are a party to this compact; therefore the people of Virginia, in their &s;overeign capacity, may judge of its violation. It is manife&s;t that this rea&s;oning will not &s;upport the re&s;o|lution; for it claims a right of the Legi&s;lature of Vir|ginia to judge of the violation of the compact. To &s;up|port the re&s;olution, the rea&s;oning ought to be thus. The Legi&s;lature of Virginia is a party to the compact; every party to a compact has a right to judge of its violation; therefore the Legi&s;lature of Virginia has a right to judge of its violation. The premi&s;es are fal&s;e, the conclu&s;ion is not true, and the re&s;olution fails.</P>
<P>The people never act, in their &s;overeign capacity, but either in framing or di&s;&s;olving a con&s;titution. While the con&s;titution is in force, the people are either &s;ub|jects or agents of the con&s;titution. The powers of &s;o|vereignty are divided by the con&s;titution among &s;everal agents; the legi&s;lative, the judicial, the executive, and the elective agents. One or more of the&s;e powers
<PB N="7" REF="036760_0006_100AB14C6B4C9458">may be exerci&s;ed by the people; but not as &s;overeigns, but as agents of the con&s;titution. Each of the&s;e powers may be con&s;idered as a part of the &s;overeignty, and the agents may be called the &s;overeign for that part, and for that part only. For whenever they act on &s;ubjects not committed to them, they are u&s;urpers, not &s;ove|reigns. And the Legi&s;lature, acting on a judicial &s;ub|ject, is no more &s;overeign, than the Judiciary acting on a legi&s;lative &s;ubject. It is u&s;urpation in either. The people of the United States have, for general purpo&s;es, united all the &s;tates into one &s;tate, territory, or empire; and have given general legi&s;lative, judicial, executive, and elective power to agents for this empire. The peo|ple of each &s;tate have given legi&s;lative, judicial, exe|cutive, and elective powers, within their &s;everal limits, to agents for tho&s;e limits. By authority derived from the people of each &s;tate, &s;ubordinate powers are given to agents for inferior di&s;tricts of each &s;tate. Within their powers, tho&s;e &s;ubordinate agents are as much &s;overeigns as the Legi&s;lature of the &s;tate. And the Legi&s;lature of Virginia has no more right to arraign the exerci&s;e of the powers of the Legi&s;lature of the United States, than county Commi&s;&s;ioners of Penn&s;ylvania, to arraign the exerci&s;e of the powers of the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylva|nia. The right of judging of the exerci&s;e of the powers of the Legi&s;lature of the United States is ve&s;ted in the Judiciary, or (to u&s;e the words of the report) in "the people in their highe&s;t &s;overeign capacity." The mem|bers of the Virginia A&s;&s;embly were cho&s;en by the peo|ple of that &s;tate to make laws for Virginia, not to judge of the laws of the United States. When they under|dertake to judge of the laws of the United States, they act not in a corporate or &s;overeign capacity, but give their opinion as individuals, and without any public au|thority.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of this judicial power, over the acts of the Federal Government, by the &s;tate Legi&s;latures, is as dangerous as it is illegal; and, with &s;uch exerci&s;e of power, it may be averred, that the Union cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t. The Legi&s;lature of Virginia con&s;i&s;ts of more mem|bers
<PB N="8" REF="036760_0007_100AB14E8DEE40F0">than the Congre&s;s of the United States; and the Legi&s;latures of the other &s;tates are numerous. I &s;hall not make any invidious di&s;tinction between the capacity and information of the members of the &s;everal &s;tate Le|gi&s;latures, and of the Federal Legi&s;lature; but I may fairly &s;tate that influence is not in proportion to capacity and information, nor the&s;e in proportion to number; and I may fairly pre&s;ume, from the importance of the &s;ub|ject, and the opportunity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that the capacity and information of the Federal Legi&s;lature is &s;uperior. Their integrity may be pre&s;umed equal: for all are equally bound by the laws; and equally influenced by a conte&s;t for power. And the chance, that the Federal Legi&s;lature is in the right, may be better, from the ha|bit, under the confederation, of exerci&s;e by the &s;tate Legi&s;latures of powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in the Federal Legi&s;lature. Extingui&s;hed claims do not readi|ly yield to new rights. Suppo&s;ing therefore the autho|rity of the Federal Legi&s;lature to be legal and proper, what chance would there be for its pre&s;ervation (with a people not always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the be&s;t means of informa|tion, and not &s;eldom corrupted by fal&s;e information) in a conte&s;t between it and the Legi&s;latures of all the &s;tates, each claiming to act by authority? In &s;uch a conte&s;t, the pre&s;ervation of the Federal Government would &s;eem to be a matter rather of miraculous, than of ju&s;t, calcula|tion; no rea&s;onable man would calculate upon it; and the di&s;&s;olution of the Union would be a con&s;equence al|mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If each of the &s;tate Legi&s;latures has authority to judge of the acts of the General Legi&s;lature, what chance would there be for uniformity of deci&s;ion? Endle&s;s di|ver&s;ities of opinion would exi&s;t; the pa&s;&s;ions of the peo|ple would be embarked and di&s;tracted; and the Union would be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The people of each &s;tate, the parties to the compact, have not ve&s;ted their &s;everal Legi&s;latures with this judi|cial power. They have given it to other agents, the Ju|diciary departments, ri&s;ing in various grades, from a Ju&s;tice of the peace to the Supreme Court of the United
<PB N="9" REF="036760_0008_100AB150AC002CE8">States, and all being the agents of the people. By &s;uf|fering this power to remain where the people have placed it, uniformity of con&s;truction can be regularly and hap|pily attained. If corruption is to be pre&s;umed, will the Legi&s;lature, a numerous body, with little profit or du|ration attached to their authority, have greater re&s;pect for their character, than the Judiciary will have? If there be a paramount judicial authority, its exerci&s;e re&s;ults not to the Legi&s;lature, which is but another agent of the people, for another purpo&s;e, but to the people of each &s;tate, the parties to the compact, who can correct the evil in their elective or &s;overeign capacity.</P>
<P>The 4th. re&s;olution <HI>"expe&s;&s;es deep regret, that a &s;pirit has been manife&s;ted by the Federal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced con&s;tructions of the Con&s;titution, and a de&s;ign to expound certain general phra&s;es &s;o as to de&s;troy the effect of the particular enumeration, which nece&s;&s;arily limits them, and &s;o as to con&s;olidate the &s;tates into one &s;overeignty, the tendency and re&s;ult of which would be to transform the republican &s;y&s;tem of the United States into an ab&s;olute or mixed monarchy."</HI></P>
<P>As in&s;tances of <HI>"a &s;pirit in the Federal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced con&s;truction,"</HI> the report enume|rates <HI>"The Alien and Sedition acts, the Bank-law, and the Carriage-tax."</HI> The two fir&s;t are the &s;ubjects of very &s;e|vere cen&s;ure in a &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olution. I &s;hall on this point only ob&s;erve, that the judiciary of the United States, the agents of the people for this purpo&s;e, have determined, that the Sedition-act and the Carriage-tax are within the con&s;titutional power of Congre&s;s, by a ju&s;t and not forced con&s;truction; and it lies not in the mouth of the Virginia legi&s;lature, to controvert this. And, with re&s;pect to the Bank-law, it will be recollected, that the Congre&s;s under the confederation did deliberately, &s;o|lemnly, and almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly, incorporate and e&s;ta|bli&s;h the Bank of North America,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals 26th. May and 29th. December 1781.</NOTE> which remained in exi&s;tence at the formation and adoption of the con&s;titu|tion of the United States. So notorious an exerci&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="036760_0009_100AB152E85D6F60">this power, by a Congre&s;s of far le&s;s authority than that which e&s;tabli&s;hed the Bank of the United States, unre|&s;trained and unnoticed by the con&s;titution, &s;eems a &s;trong argument, that the power to e&s;tabli&s;h Banks exi&s;ted in Congre&s;s under the confederation, and exi&s;ts under the con&s;titution. This argument is &s;trengthened by this cir|cum&s;tance, that Mr. Madi&s;on, one of the four members of Congre&s;s who voted again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank of North America, and a member of the commit|tee who made the report to the Virginia Legi&s;lature, was a member of the general convention, which framed, and of the Virginia convention which adopted, the con|&s;titution. Strength is al&s;o given to this argument by the general acquie&s;cence in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank of the United States. So that the cen&s;ure of the report looks rather like a petti&s;h adherence to an ob&s;tinate prejudice than a &s;ound opinion on a con&s;titutional point.</P>
<P><HI>"The de&s;ign to expound certain general phra&s;es in the Con|&s;titution, &s;o as to de&s;troy the effect of the particular enumeration which nece&s;&s;arily limits them,"</HI> has, it &s;eems never manife&s;ted it&s;elf in any act of the Federal government; and the re|port ju&s;tifies the re&s;olution, from a vague reference to <HI>"debates in the Federal Legi&s;lature,"</HI> from <HI>"a report of the late Secretary of the Trea&s;ury on manufactures,"</HI> and from <HI>"a report of a committee of Congre&s;s on the promotion of agri|culture."</HI> Admitting the cen&s;orial power exerci&s;ed by the Virginia A&s;&s;embly, their vigilant exerci&s;e of it is highly meritorious, &s;ince it is not merely corrective but preven|tive, and, like the laws of Heaven, extends not merely to the conduct but to the heart, not merely to acts but to de&s;igns, not merely to any branch of the admini&s;tration, but to every member and agent of any branch.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution mentions no general phra&s;e, which a de&s;ign appears &s;o to expound, as to de&s;troy the effect of the particular enumeration nece&s;&s;arily limiting them. This defect is &s;upplied by the report, which &s;tates, that "the general phra&s;es here meant mu&s;t be tho&s;e of <HI>provi|ding for the common defence and general welfare."</HI></P>
<P>The proofs of a de&s;ign to pervert the con&s;truction of the&s;e phra&s;es are debates in Congre&s;s, a report of the late
<PB N="11" REF="036760_0010_100AB155EAF18BA8">Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and a report of a committee of Congre&s;s. No debate in Congre&s;s is &s;pecified as a proof of this. If any were, it would be proof only of a de&s;ign or mi&s;take of the individual member. It is &s;tated "that in the Secretary's report, it is expre&s;sly contended to belong to the di&s;cretion of the National Legi&s;lature, to prenounce upon the objects which concern the <HI>general wel|fare,</HI> and for which, under that de&s;cription, an appropri|ation of money is requi&s;ite and proper. And there &s;eems to be no room for a doubt, that whatever concerns the general intere&s;ts of LEARNING, of AGRICUL|TURE, of MANUFACTURES, and of COM|MERCE, are within the &s;phere of the National Councils <HI>as far as regards an application of money."</HI> "The report of the committee on agriculture" (it is &s;tated) "a&s;&s;umes the &s;ame latitude of power in the National Councils, and applies it to the encouragement of agriculture." It was not thought prudent to mention, that the&s;e principles had been &s;anctioned by the judgment of the late Pre&s;ident of the United States. The venerable name of WASH|INGTON, whom even envy and malice, the con&s;tant attendants of living virtue, now cea&s;e to di&s;turb in his grave, might have covered the&s;e principles with &s;uch a &s;hield of integrity and wi&s;dom, that the a&s;&s;aults of the Virginia A&s;&s;embly would have been harmle&s;s. But, with|out &s;heltering them in the &s;hade of an ILLUSTRIOUS name, let us examine the rea&s;oning with which they are oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The report of the Virginia committee &s;tates, <HI>that the power given to Congre&s;s by the con&s;titution, "to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States," is limited by the &s;ub&s;equent enumeration of particular ca&s;es, and extends not beyond them.</HI> This po&s;ition it &s;upports, <HI>by the &s;imilarity of expre&s;&s;ion in the</HI> 8th. <HI>article of the confederation, and in the</HI> 8th. <HI>&s;ection of the 1&s;t. article of the con&s;titution of the United States;</HI> and by a conclu&s;ion, <HI>that if the general phra&s;es were &s;o limited in the confederation, they mu&s;t be &s;o li|mited in the con&s;titution.</HI> The conclu&s;ion might have ap|peared ju&s;t, if the con&s;titution had manife&s;ted no de&s;ign to enlarge the powers of Congre&s;s; if our union under the con&s;titution had been, as under the confederation, an
<PB N="12" REF="036760_0011_100AB1580A82EEE8">union of governments, and not, as to general purpo&s;es, an union of people; and if Congre&s;s were not now, what it was not formerly, a repre&s;entation of the people in each &s;tate, as the A&s;&s;embly of each &s;tate is a repre&s;entation of each county of that &s;tate. In &s;uch a great change of circum&s;tances, the conclu&s;ion, that the powers remain the &s;ame, is hardly logical, and &s;urely not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Virginia report contends, that, though Congre&s;s has power to rai&s;e money and apply it to provide for the general welfare of the United States, <HI>it has no power to apply money to any ca&s;e not &s;pecially enumerated in the con&s;titu|tion. Whenever money is to be applied to a particular mea&s;ure, a que&s;tion ari&s;es whether the particular mea&s;ure be within the enumerated authorities ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s. If it be, money may be applied, if it be not, no &s;uch application can be made. This interpretation is enforced by the clau&s;e in the con&s;titution, which declares that no money &s;hall be drawn from the Trea&s;ury, but in|con&s;equence of appropriations made by law. An appropriation of money to the general welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery, than an ob&s;ervance, of this con&s;titutional injunction.</HI></P>
<P>The GREAT FATHER of his country, the committee of Congre&s;s, and the late Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, may be fairly believed as competent to give a ju&s;t interpre|tation of the con&s;titution as the Virginia committee, and their interpretation will not be weakened by the interpre|tation of the con&s;titution as the Virginia committee, and their interpretation will not be weakened by the interpre|tation of the Virginia committee, but &s;o far as this is &s;up|ported by rea&s;oning. The late Secretary of the Trea&s;ury &s;ays, and he is &s;upported by the late Pre&s;ident, and by the committee of Congre&s;s, that it belongs "to the di&s;cretion of the National Legi&s;lature, to pronounce upon the ob|jects which concern the general welfare, and for which, under that de&s;cription, an appropriation of money is re|qui&s;ite." The nece&s;&s;ity of an appropriation before money can be drawn, and the <HI>mockery,</HI> if there were any, of an appropriation to the general welfare, will not operate again&s;t this interpretation.

There is nothing therefore in the Virginia rea&s;oning to invalidate the interpretation of the late Pre&s;ident, the committee of Congre&s;s, and the late Secretary; and it will not be pretended, that, on mere authority, the in|terpretation of the Virginia committee or A&s;&s;embly de|&s;orves a pre&s;erence.</P>
<P>The Virginia report argues not fairly. On the pre|&s;umption that Congre&s;s has no powers but tho&s;e &s;pecified in the con&s;titution, it concludes, that the power by the fir&s;t clau&s;e of the 8th. &s;ection of the I&s;t article of the con&s;titution granted to Congre&s;s "to rai&s;e money to pro|vide for the general welfare," is explained and limited by the &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;es, which &s;pecify the in&s;tances, and the only in&s;tances, in which Congre&s;s has power to pro|vide for the general welfare of the United States. On this ground, all the other clau&s;es, and Congre&s;s has no power but one, to rai&s;e money, or, in the words of the con&s;titution, "to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;es and exci&s;es;" and all that follows of this &s;ection is only de&s;criptive of the objects, to which this money is to be applied; the fir&s;t clau&s;e de&s;cribing the object in <HI>general phra&s;es,</HI> and the other clau&s;es detailing the <HI>particular mea|&s;ures</HI> comprehended within tho&s;e general phra&s;es. This &s;ection will then amount to this: Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to rai&s;e money, <HI>in order to borrow money, in order to regulate commerce, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of natu|ralization and uniform laws of bankruptey, in order to regulate the value of money and fix the &s;landard of weights and mea|&s;ures, in order to provide for the puni&s;hment of counterfeiting, in order to &s;ecure to authors and inventors the exclu&s;ive right to their writings and di&s;coveries, in order to con&s;titute tribunals, in order to de&s;ine piracies, in order, &amp;c. &amp;c. and for no other pur|po&s;e whatever.</HI> This interpretation of the con&s;titution will &s;eem ab&s;urd, but it is clearly &s;upported by the rea&s;oning of the Virginia committee. If their interpretation can be &s;upported, mine may be al&s;o, and if mine fails, &s;o mu&s;t theirs. For if the phra&s;e "general welfare," do not imply a di&s;tinct power, (or duty which involves a power) but be limited by the &s;ub&s;equent phra&s;es, all the &s;ub&s;e|quent phra&s;es taken together can mean no more that it.</P>

Admitting that Congre&s;s has no powers but tho&s;e &s;pe|cified in the con&s;titution, and that the 8th. &s;ection of the 1&s;t. article is a &s;pecification of their powers, it &s;eems clear, that (in&s;tead of the fir&s;t clau&s;e being general phra&s;es explained and limited by the &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;es) every clau&s;e gives a di&s;tinct power, and every power is coupled with a duty, the di&s;charge of which is &s;ubmitted to the di&s;cretion of Congre&s;s. Thus the fir&s;t clau&s;e impo&s;es on Congre&s;s a <HI>duty</HI> "to provide for the common defence and general welfare" of the United States; and &s;ubmitting to the di&s;cretion of Congre&s;s what objects or mea&s;ures are nece&s;&s;ary or conducive to the&s;e ends, for their accompli&s;h|ment gives to Congre&s;s a <HI>power</HI> "to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es." The &s;econd clau&s;e gives another power to the exerci&s;e of which a duty is nece&s;&s;a|rily impo&s;ed, whenever Congre&s;s, in its di&s;cretion, &s;hall think its exerci&s;e nece&s;&s;ary. And &s;o of every other clau&s;e of this &s;ection.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;trange indeed, that expre&s;&s;ions in the confe|deration, which gave no internal legi&s;lative powers to Congre&s;s, &s;hould, by the Virginia committee, be applied to limit expre&s;&s;ions in the con&s;titution avowedly made to give to Congre&s;s internal legi&s;lative powers. Under the Confederation, it was the <HI>duty</HI> of Congre&s;s "to manage the general intere&s;ts,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Confederation, Article 5.</NOTE> provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but for this purpo&s;e, they had no <HI>power</HI> to rai&s;e money. The con&s;ti|tution has, to this duty, united this power; and Congre&s;s has, under the con&s;titution all the &s;uperintending and pro|vident duty which Congre&s;s had under the confederation, together with all the legi&s;lative power, for the di&s;charge of this duty, which the confederation had left with the &s;everal &s;tates. The 8th. article of the confederation was not a limitation of the powers of Congre&s;s, but a direc|tion how the money, for the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e powers, &s;hould be rai&s;ed by the &s;tates. The nece&s;&s;ity of an auxi|liary &s;tate power, to enable the Federal Government to di&s;charge its duties, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of efficaciou&s;ly obtaining this aid, was the great defect of the confede|ration.
<PB N="15" REF="036760_0014_100AB15E9D780970">This is &s;upplied by the con&s;titution, which gives to Congre&s;s all legi&s;lative power, for the execution of their duties; and makes the government of the United State; a compleat government with all powers within it|&s;elf for general purpo&s;es. In judging of the power of Congre&s;s under the con&s;titution, we mu&s;t not limit it by the power of Congre&s;s under the confederation: for it has now all the power which the former Congre&s;s had to pre&s;cribe and require, and the power which the &s;tate le|gi&s;latures had to execute or provide means for executing the pre&s;criptions and requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s. The pro|per compari&s;on between the powers would therefore be, that in ca&s;es where the former Congre&s;s could officially, and for the general welfare, require the &s;tate legi&s;latures to pa&s;s laws; the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s can pa&s;s tho&s;e laws it&s;elf. Thus if the former Congre&s;s had declared to the &s;everal &s;tate legi&s;latures, that the United States were in danger from the re&s;idence of Aliens, and the prevalence of Seditious Libels; and that the general welfare required that each &s;tate &s;hould pa&s;s Alien and Sedition laws; would any one doubt that it was the duty of each &s;tate to obey this requi&s;ition? And if it was the duty of each &s;tate legi&s;lature to do &s;o then; is it not the duty of Con|gre&s;s to do &s;o now when legi&s;lative powers have been given to enable Congre&s;s it&s;elf to di&s;charge all its duties?</P>
<P>As the Con&s;titution thus enlarged the powers of Con|gre&s;s, it enlarged al&s;o the control of the people over the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e powers, by giving to the people of the United States the immediate election of Repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s, without who&s;e con&s;ent no act of Congre&s;s can be made. So that now the General Legi&s;lature hav|ing power over all general concerns and care of the ge|neral welfare, ought to be deemed as immediately the repre&s;entatives, and as ju&s;tly intitled to the confidence of the people of the United States, as the &s;tate legi&s;la|tures are the repre&s;entatives, and intitled to the confi|dence of the people of their re&s;pective &s;tates. The wel|fare of the &s;everal &s;tates is intru&s;ted to the care of their &s;everal legi&s;latures; and the general welfare to the Ge|neral Legi&s;lature, with competent powers to each for the di&s;charge of the duties impo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036760_0015_100AB160D73256D8">
As the Con&s;titution plainly gives to Congre&s;s power over the means to provide for the general welfare, the propriety of exerci&s;ing this power by the Repre&s;enta|tives of the people of the United States can hardly be que&s;tioned. The regulations of no &s;tate can extend be|yond its own limits; and the concurrence of all the &s;tates, in every mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary for the general welfare, is not to be expected, or mu&s;t be tardy and incumbered. If Congre&s;s, therefore, do not apply their power over the means to every ca&s;e of general welfare, &s;ome ca&s;es will be unprovided for; and Congre&s;s, by neglecting to ap|ply its power, will neglect its duty, and betray the in|tere&s;ts of its con&s;tituents, the people of the United States.</P>
<P>The condition in which the Virginia report would place the nation of the United States is &s;ingularly ab|&s;urd; a nation without authority to provide for its own welfare. The individual &s;tates cannot provide for it: for their authority is limited within their &s;everal boundaries. Congre&s;s, as the report &s;ays, cannot provide for it: for its authority extends only to <HI>&s;ome</HI> ca&s;es of the general welfare. The con&s;titution is not &s;o ab&s;urd. It gives to Congre&s;s power over the means, and impo&s;es the duty of providing for the general welfare in all ca&s;es whatever, to which in its di&s;cretion the means ought to be applied. And this power and di&s;cretion is to be controlled, like the power and di&s;cretion of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, by the judiciary, or by the people in their elective or their &s;o|vereign capacity.</P>
<P>If &s;uch then be the ju&s;t con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, the objection &s;tated in the report, that it tends to con&s;o|lidate the &s;tates into one &s;overeignty, has no force; for the con&s;titution is the work of the people of the United States; and an objection to a ju&s;t con&s;truction of the con|&s;titution is an objection to the con&s;titution it&s;elf, which is an objection to the act of the people of the United States, and will not lie in the mouth of the Legi&s;lature of Vir|ginia, who are but agents, for a particular purpo&s;e, of a part of the people of the United States.</P>

Ever &s;ince the "United States a&s;&s;umed a &s;eparate and equal &s;tation among the powers of the earth," they have been, as every nation mu&s;t be, con&s;olidated, as to general purpo&s;es into one &s;overeignty. The confederation ve&s;ted the powers of this &s;overeignty in Congre&s;s; and the con|&s;titution enlarged the powers of this &s;overeignty, en|larging al&s;o the control of the people over the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e powers. The enlargement of the general autho|rity of the United States, become indi&s;pen&s;able, was effected by a diminution of the individual authority of the &s;everal &s;tates. What was taken from one &s;et of agents of the people, was given to another &s;et of agents of the people; and the control of the people over their agents was &s;till pre&s;erved. The authority of the people was not dimini&s;hed, the power only of their agents was altered. That there &s;hould be a &s;overeignty, or power co-exten|&s;ive with the territory, and adequate to the general wants and [welfare, is not an objection, but a prai&s;e, to the &s;y&s;tem of government adopted by the people. If it can be urged as an objection, it will lie only again&s;t the ex|tent of territory, not the extent of power, and will con|clude, not to a diminution of power, but to a diminution of territory&mdash;to a di&s;&s;olution of the Union&mdash;a &s;eparation of the &s;tates. Is it to this conclu&s;ion that the report would lead?</P>
<P>That a power to rai&s;e money in order to provide for the general welfare, or a power to provide for the gene|ral welfare, &s;hould, by any po&s;&s;ible con&s;truction be &s;o extended as to amount to a power to <HI>legi&s;late in all ca&s;es whatever,</HI> and &s;o to con&s;olidate the &s;tates into one &s;ove|reignty, &s;eems a &s;uppo&s;ition &s;o extravagant, that I can|not per&s;uade my&s;elf, it will ever be hone&s;tly and &s;eriou&s;ly urged. But admitting it po&s;&s;ible (probable it is not) is it a greater evil, that the general welfare of the United States &s;hould be provided for by one body of repre&s;enta|tives of the people, in&s;tead of &s;everal; or &s;hould be left altogether unprovided for?</P>
<P>This dreaded <HI>con&s;olidation of the &s;tates,</HI> and its portended re&s;ult, the <HI>transformation of our republican &s;y&s;tem into a mo|narchy,</HI> I cannot confider as the work of hone&s;t rational
<PB N="18" REF="036760_0017_100AB166024B3820">conviction, but as either the fiction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, or the delu|&s;ion of party on the pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices, or inexperience of the people. If it have a rational foundation, it mu&s;t be this, that a general authority of a republican form cannot be exerci&s;ed over &s;o exten&s;ive a territory as that of the United States. From this po&s;ition the conclu&s;ion will be, either that there mu&s;t be a diminution of terri|tory, in other words, a &s;eparation of the Union; or our republican government mu&s;t be changed to a monarchy; or the welfare of the United States mu&s;t be unprovided for, which, in other words, is, that the powers &s;hall be incompetent to the purpo&s;es of government. Can any fears of a change of government ju&s;tify the with-holding from government the means of providing for the welfare of the people?</P>
<P>The report contends, that the re&s;ult of con&s;olidation will be monarchy, <HI>"becau&s;e the legi&s;lature will increa&s;e the pre|rogative of the executive, by delegating to it legi&s;lative powers; becau&s;e the con&s;olidation will increa&s;e the patronage of the execu|tive; and becau&s;e this increa&s;e of prerogative and patronage will either enable the Chief Magi&s;trate, quietly and repeatedly, to &s;ecure his election, and finally to regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; or will render the elections of Chief Magi&s;trate &s;o violent and cor|rupt, that the public voice it&s;elf might call for an hereditary in place of an elective &s;ucce&s;&s;ion."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend time in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing conjectures like the&s;e; but will ju&s;t ob&s;erve that any prerogative, given by the legi&s;lature to the executive, may be re&s;trained, or re|claimed by the power which gave it, and the legi&s;lature will always be under the control of the people; that the people will always control the election of Pre&s;ident in &s;pite of all patronage, while they remain uncorrupted, and fit for the exerci&s;e of their rights; that if corruption in the people admit hopes of monarchy, &s;uch hopes, with the pre&s;ent or without any patronage, will excite violence &s;ufficient to produce the effect dreaded from it; and that, if the public voice ever call for an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, no con&s;titutional provi&s;ions can prevent it.</P>
<P>But I am not convinced that a republican form, with a proper di&s;tribution of authority and power, is incom|petent

<P>The 5th. re&s;olution <HI>"prote&s;ts again&s;t the palpable and alarming infractions of the con&s;titution in the ca&s;es of the Alien and Sedition acts; the fir&s;t of which exerci&s;es a power not dele|gated to the Federal Government, and by uniting legi&s;lative and judicial powers to executive, &s;ubverts the principles of free go|vernment, and the provi&s;ions of the Federal Con&s;titution; and the other of which al&s;o exerci&s;es a power not delegated, but ex|pre&s;sly forbidden by the con&s;titution, a power which, more than any other, ought to produce univer&s;al alarm, becau&s;e levelled again&s;t that right of freely examining public characters and mea|&s;ures, and of free communication among the people, which has ever been ju&s;tly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right."</HI></P>
<P>The report, viewing this as the great leading re&s;olu|tion, enters into an ample inve&s;tigation of it.

It is &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, that their amendment of the con&s;titution here relied on, like other amendments, made little, if any, alteration of the con&s;titution. Bor|rowed from the confederation, it proceeded from a fal&s;e jealou&s;y, ri&s;ing from a fal&s;e principle, and applying to a compact made by the people, of power to be exerci&s;ed by repre&s;entatives of the people, re&s;trictions in a compact made by the governments, of power exerci&s;ed by repre|&s;entatives of governments. However this may be, it will not be pretended, that this amendment deprives the go|vernment of the United States of any power given it by the con&s;titution; nor that Congre&s;s, under the con&s;titu|tion, has le&s;s power than Congre&s;s had before; nor that any nation would be &s;o ab&s;urd, as to form a government without power to manage its general intere&s;ts, and pro|vide for its common defence and general welfare. Nor will it be denied, that the government of the United States has power to carry on intercour&s;e with foreign nations, make war or peace, or form treaties of alliance and commerce; and that no individual &s;tates has any authority to interfere in any foreign affairs; nor that the government of the United States is intru&s;ted with the management of its general intere&s;ts, with providing for the common defence and general welfare, with the pro|tection of each &s;tate again&s;t inva&s;ion, and dome&s;tic vio|lence, with the pre&s;ervation of the peace and &s;afety of the United States, and with power to make all laws ne|ce&s;&s;ary and proper for executing its powers and duties. Nor will it be demed, that aliens may be dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States; nor that the government of every other nation has power to remove aliens, when and how it choo&s;es, on all rea&s;onable occa|&s;ions, in any rea&s;onable manner, without any re&s;pect to the rules by which it is governed in the puni&s;hment or re&s;traint of its own &s;ubjects. The declaration of Inde|pendence, which rai&s;ed the United States to the rank of a nation, gave to any government, which the people of the United States &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h with the charge of common defence and foreign intercour&s;e, all the rights which the law of nations gives to every &s;overeign go|vernment. The people have e&s;tabli&s;hed the government of the United States with this &s;overeign charge, and the law
<PB N="21" REF="036760_0020_100AB16B499EE400">of nations gives it all &s;overeign rights with re&s;pect to other nations. The re&s;trictions of the con&s;titution are not re&s;trictions of external and national right, but of internal and municipal right. And power over aliens is to be mea&s;ured, not by internal and municipal law, but by ex|ternal and national law. It affects not the people of the United States, parties and &s;ubjects to the con&s;titution; but foreign governments, who&s;e &s;ubjects the aliens are. Fo|reign governments, parties to the code of national law, may call the government of the United States to account for the abu&s;e of its right under this law; but the con&s;ti|tution of the United States re&s;trains it not. The govern|ment of the United States being exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted with the power of peace and war and foreign intercour&s;e, mu&s;t be exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted with the means (and the admi&s;&s;ion or expul&s;ion of aliens may be one of the means) of pro|ducing or affecting either. And being charged with the common defence and protection again&s;t inva&s;ion and do|me&s;tic violence, the government of the United States, with a di&s;cretion to judge of the proper means, mu&s;t be ve&s;ted with all means conducive to the&s;e ends, and con|&s;i&s;tent, according to their re&s;pective objects, with the municipal law, and the law of nations. The con&s;titution could never intend to make the government of the United States, as the report would make it, a government of duties without powers: for it was framed expre&s;sly to add powers to duties. The con&s;titution was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people of the United States, "to form a more perfect union, in&s;ure dome&s;tic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, and promote the general welfare." Any con&s;truction of this con&s;titution, not unavoidable, which would deprive the government of any proper means to promote tho&s;e ends will be rejected. Whatever is fairly involved in any power granted by the con&s;titu|tion, is a power granted by the con&s;titution, and cannot be re&s;trained by the provi&s;ion that the powers not dele|gated are re&s;erved. And all powers of peace and war, and foreign intercour&s;e, and therefore the means of pro|ducing or affecting either, are delegated to the United States by the con&s;titution, and prohibited by it to the in|dividual &s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="036760_0021_100AB16CE4B19DA0">
The next ob&s;ervation in the report is, <HI>that there is a di&s;tinction, by the law of nations, between alien enemies, and alien friends.</HI> To be &s;ure there is: Alien friends have by the law of nations certain ho&s;pitable rights &s;ubject to the rea&s;onable di&s;cretion of the government under which they live; and alien enemies have no rights. But the que&s;tion is, whether every government may not, when it judges it proper for its own &s;afety, order and compell "aliens, members of a friendly nation," to depart out of its ter|ritory. Every government has, by the law of nations, authority to do this. The right of a nation to the exclu|&s;ive enjoyment of its own territory is, like the right of an individual to the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of his own hou&s;e, a perfect right, &s;ubject only to the right of ho&s;pitality, an imperfect right, at the di&s;cretion of the owner. This is a doctrine too well e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of nations, to need any authorities to &s;upport it: a very &s;light in&s;pection of any book of this law will ju&s;tify it. And, on this principle, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;tipulate in the confederation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article 4.</NOTE> that "the people of each &s;tate &s;hall have free ingre&s;s and regre&s;s to and from any other &s;tate, and enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce."</P>
<P>A third ob&s;ervation is, that, "admitting the object of the alien act to be preventive, not penal ju&s;tice, and within the power of the Federal Legi&s;lature; <HI>this power has not been exerci&s;ed in a con&s;titutional manner."</HI></P>
<P>I hope, it has already appeared, that this power is given to the government of the United States: and, as its object is not municipal ju&s;tice, either penal or preven|tive, but public national defence, and as it affects no party to the con&s;titution, but a party to the law of nati|ons; its exerci&s;e is to be regulated, not by the con&s;titution or municipal law, but by the general law of nations. Has the con&s;titution pre&s;cribed, that aliens, like "the citizens of each &s;tate, &s;hall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in every &s;tate?" Was the de|nial or retraction of an imperfect right, a favour or in|dulgence, ever called a <HI>puni&s;hment?</HI> Or has the law of
<PB N="23" REF="036760_0022_100AB16FA7089590">nations ever called the removal of aliens a bani&s;hment? It were well if the Virginia A&s;&s;embly would allow to Congre&s;s as much preventive vigilance, with re&s;pect to dangerous aliens, as they have them&s;elves exerci&s;ed in their a&s;&s;umed authority on the de&s;ign to expound general phra&s;es; and would as readily &s;uppo&s;e that aliens may be dangerous, as that the government of the United States may be corrupt.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the report proceeds to an&s;wer the arguments by which the alien act has been ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t an&s;wer &s;ugge&s;ts a doubt, <HI>whether the di&s;cretio|nary power of admitting aliens be ve&s;ted in the Federal Govern|ment, or in the &s;tate governments;</HI> that is, whether, though Congre&s;s has power to e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of natu|ralization, every &s;tate has not a power to naturalize, without any regard to the uniform rule of Congre&s;s. Can the Virginia committee di&s;cover in the Federal Go|vernment a de&s;ign &s;o gro&s;sly to pervert the con&s;titution, as is manife&s;ted in this doubt? This committee, and the Secretary of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, in a note to one of the laws of that &s;tate, are the only patrons of this doubt that I know.</P>
<P>"<HI>But it cannot be a true inference, that, becau&s;e the admi&s;&s;ion of an alien is a favour, the favour may be revoked.</HI> A grant of land or a pardon may be a favour, but irrevocable. Admi&s;&s;ion of an alien to naturalization is as much a fa|vour, as admi&s;&s;ion to re&s;idence."</P>
<P>If the favour be complete in one act, as a grant of land, or a pardon, to be &s;ure, it cannot be revoked. But if the enjoyment of the benefit depend on the continuance of the benevolence, the favor may be revoked. If I con|vey my hou&s;e gratuitou&s;ly, and thereby part with all my right in it; I cannot deve&s;t the right I have conveyed. But if I give a &s;tranger a lodging in it for a night, I may turn him out next day. Admi&s;&s;ion of an alien to re&s;i|dence is not admi&s;&s;ion to naturalization: the fir&s;t is revo|cable, like a permi&s;&s;ion; the other ab&s;olute, like a grant. The author of the report, who had ingenuity to devi&s;e the illu&s;tration, did not want judgment to di&s;cern the
<PB N="24" REF="036760_0023_100AB1726BB08648">fallacy of the rea&s;oning. Admi&s;&s;ion of aliens to re&s;idence is not a grant of naturalization: this, until the grant be ab&s;olutely made, mu&s;t depend on the continuance of the benevolence of the government towards them.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the four following an&s;wers to ju&s;tifications of this act, either becau&s;e the ju&s;tifications have been &s;uffici|ently and publickly e&s;tabli&s;hed before, or becau&s;e I think them not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The next is an an&s;wer to the ju&s;tification, "that the means of preventing inva&s;ions are included in the power of protecting again&s;t them."</P>
<P>One would have thought it would not be denied, for it is evident, that a power to protect again&s;t inva&s;ion did include a power to u&s;e all proper means to prevent it, or defeat its &s;ucce&s;s; and what means more proper to pro|tect again&s;t inva&s;ion can there be, than the means given by the alien act; a power to remove "aliens dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States, or concerned in any trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations again&s;t the go|vernment thereof." As aliens are not entitled to the pri|vileges of citizens, any farther than the con&s;titution and laws direct, and as the con&s;titution &s;ays nothing of them, the legi&s;lature has a right to pre&s;cribe in what manner, they &s;hall be dealt with. As the legi&s;lature has referred to the di&s;cretion of the Pre&s;ident, to determine who of them &s;hall be deemed dangerous, or concerned in any trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations again&s;t the govern|ment, and as &s;uch removed; and as their removal is con|&s;i&s;tent with the law of nations, by which only it can be judged, and is a proper mean of preventing or defeating an inva&s;ion, which is clearly the &s;ame as protecting again&s;t an inva&s;ion; their removal in this manner &s;eems clearly within the power and duty of Congre&s;s to pro|tect again&s;t inva&s;ions by a ju&s;t and natural con&s;truction of the con&s;titution. To adopt an illu&s;tration u&s;ed by the report, a municipal power to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> involves a municipal power to <HI>prevent:</HI> for the judge who can try a breach of the peace, can bind over to keep the peace. What a mu|nicipal judge can do in the manner pre&s;cribed by the municipal law, the legi&s;lature can do or direct to be done,
<PB N="25" REF="036760_0024_100AB173F0749E08">with re&s;pect to an alien, in any manner con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nations. Will the report deny that a power to protect again&s;t an evil includes a power over the means proper to prevent it? What would the committee think of a phy&s;ician engaged for a yearly &s;um, who &s;hould tell his employer, when &s;eized with a fever, <HI>I &s;aw this fever coming on you, and could have prevented it; but I am engaged only to cure, and not to prevent di&s;ea&s;es?</HI></P>
<P>The committee &s;eem aware of &s;uch ab&s;urd rea&s;oning, and only refu&s;e to grant, "that a power to act on a ca&s;e when it occurs, includes a power over <HI>all</HI> the means that <HI>may tend</HI> to prevent its occurrence." Is not this con|founding power with di&s;cretion, a rea&s;onable with a wan|ton di&s;cretion, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">nferring a want of power from a po&s;|&s;ibility of its abu&s;e? On &s;uch rea&s;oning what power might not be denied?</P>
<P>To le&s;&s;en the force of the clau&s;e in the con&s;titution en|joining the government of the United States to protect again&s;t inva&s;ion, the report con&s;iders it as <HI>"either a &s;pe|cification of the power of war in general, before granted, or as a duty &s;uperadded to a power;"</HI> and rea&s;ons thus, <HI>"In|va&s;ion is an operation of war. To protect again&s;t inva&s;ion is an exerci&s;e of the power of war. A power, therefore, not inci|dent to war, cannot be incident to a particular modification of war. And as the removal of alien friends has appeared to be no incident to a general &s;tate of war, it cannot be incident to a particular modification of war."</HI> If this rea&s;oning means any thing it mu&s;t be this: a power not incident to war, is not incident to war; or a power not incident to all war, is incident to no war, or is not incident to inva&s;ion. The fir&s;t proves nothing: for the proof and the po&s;ition are the &s;ame. The &s;econd proves too much, and is therefore fal&s;e: for there may be powers incident to &s;ome wars, or to inva&s;ion, which are not incident to all war. One of the &s;teps of the &s;yllogi&s;m is fal&s;e, and therefore the conclu|&s;ion cannot be con&s;idered as true. For it is not true, according to the law of nations, that the removal of aliens members of a friendly nation, if they are &s;uppo&s;ed dangerous, is not incident to a &s;tate of war, or to very &s;tate of rea&s;onably apprehended danger. The report &s;ays,
<PB N="26" REF="036760_0025_100AB1762F207400">that, <HI>"without this clau&s;e of the con&s;titution, the power to protect again&s;t inva&s;ion is included in the power to declare war."</HI> This on the principle &s;o much relied on by the report, <HI>that general phra&s;es are limited by the particular &s;pecifications and every power not &s;pecified is refu&s;ed,</HI> is &s;aying, that to de|clare war is to protect again&s;t inva&s;ion. Pre&s;umptions it would &s;eem are admi&s;&s;ible to le&s;&s;en, but not to enlarge, the powers of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Without a&s;&s;enting to the rea&s;oning by which the next an&s;wer is &s;upported (for I think it exceptionable) I &s;hall not di&s;cu&s;s it; becau&s;e it &s;eems not material to the main point. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the con&s;titution meant to deny the government of the United States the important right of u&s;ing, towards other nations, all means, con|&s;i&s;tent with the law of nations, for the common defence of the &s;tates, and their protection again&s;t inva&s;ion. No|thing appears from the con&s;titution, that can &s;hew, that the people of the United States meant to deny their own government any right, which, by the law of nations, any other &s;overeignty enjoys with re&s;pect to foreign nati|ons: and the Alien law affects only foreign nations. The limits of power of any government, towards its own &s;ub|jects, were never meant to be applied as limits of power of that government towards the &s;ubjects of other go|vernments. And the que&s;tion, whether a government conducts it&s;elf well towards a &s;ubject of another govern|ment, is not a que&s;tion of municipal, but of national law: it cannot ari&s;e between the &s;ubject of another government and the government of which he complains, but between this and his own government. How then can the con|&s;titution of any one government be made a rule to decide this que&s;tion?</P>
<P>If the candor and "re&s;pect," which the report pro|fe&s;&s;es, had been ju&s;tly "felt;" the captious cen&s;ure on an expre&s;&s;ion in the report of a committee of Congre&s;s would have found no place in it. The con&s;titution is the act of the people of the United States, and is the &s;upreme law of the land; and no individual &s;tate ever had power of the common defence, or of foreign intercour&s;e, war, or peace.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="036760_0026_100AB17946326918">
Not having acce&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to the Alien law of Vir|ginia, from which a ju&s;tification of the Alien law of the United States has been drawn, I cannot &s;atisfactorily di&s;|cu&s;s the an&s;wer to this ju&s;tification. From the mi&s;appli|cation of the pronoun <HI>who,</HI> in the &s;tatement of that law in the report, it is difficult to &s;ay, whether it be the alien or his government, that is the object of &s;u&s;picion of <HI>ho&s;tile de&s;igns.</HI> If it be the alien, the Virginia law is the &s;ame as the law of Congre&s;s. If it be the &s;tate, an apprehen|&s;ion of ho&s;tility is not ho&s;tility; there is no war, and the alien is an alien friend, who, from the rea&s;oning in the report, ought to be treated as a citizen, and not puni&s;hed, but for an offence actually committed. And the cruelty &s;o much deplored in the report, would be the &s;ame under both acts, if a harmle&s;s alien were removed, whether his government were ho&s;tile or friendly.</P>
<P>What remains of the report re&s;pecting the alien act, as to its union of legi&s;lative and judicial with executive powers, and the influence of this union, having been &s;uf|ficiently and publickly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere; I &s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that this union can only be dan|gerous, when it is con&s;titutionaly and permanently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; not when it is only occa&s;ionlly permitted by the legi&s;lature, for a convenient and practicable execution of legi&s;lative power, and always under the control of the legi&s;lature, which is under the control of the people.</P>
<P>On this re&s;olution, as it re&s;pects the Sedition act, the reports &s;tates, "that it affirms; 1&s;t. <HI>that this act exerci&s;es a power not delegated by the con&s;titution:</HI> 2nd. <HI>that this power is expre&s;sly prohibited by one of the amendments to the con&s;titu|tion; and</HI> 3d. <HI>that this power ought, more than any other, to produce univer&s;al alarm; becau&s;e levelled again&s;t that right of free examination of public characters and mea&s;ures, and free com|munication thereon, which has ever been ju&s;tly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.</HI>"</P>
<P>I think, I am di&s;po&s;ed to treat all public authority, not perverted to improper purpo&s;es, with re&s;pect, and to examine the report with candour. But &s;o extravagant &s;eem the po&s;itions, and &s;o dangerous their con&s;equences,
<PB N="28" REF="036760_0027_100AB17B59F026E8">in many parts of this report, that I cannot reconcile them with the ingenuity &s;hewn in it, and, at the &s;ame time with &s;incerity.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> On the fir&s;t point, the report begins with ob&s;erv|ing, "that the Federal Government being compo&s;ed of powers &s;pecifically granted, with a re&s;ervation of all others to the &s;tates; <HI>the po&s;itive authority, under which the Sedition act could be pa&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t be produced.</HI>" I have already mentioned, that this principle was introduced into the con&s;titution, which is a government made by the people, from a fal&s;e imitation of the confederation, a government made by the legi&s;latures of the &s;tates. From this it &s;eems to be contended, that the Federal Government has no power, but &s;uch as the con&s;titution <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> gives. There is nothing in the con&s;titution to ju&s;tify this: and the re|port afterwards admits, "that particular parts of the common law may have a &s;anction from the con&s;titution, &s;o far as they are nece&s;&s;arily comprehended in the tech|nical phra&s;es, which expre&s;s the powers delegated to the government; and &s;o far as &s;uch other parts may be adopted as nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execu|tion the powers expre&s;sly delegated."</P>
<P>In ju&s;tifying the Sedition law, it had been urged, that it created no new offence; for every thing puni&s;hable un|der it was puni&s;hable at common law. Referring to this argument, the report cen&s;ures, as <HI>"novel and extravagant, the doctrine lately advanced, that the common or unwritten law makes a part of the law of the&s;e &s;tates in their united and nati|onal capacity."</HI> And, to ju&s;tify this, it reviews the colo|nial &s;tate of this country, and the effects of the declaration of independence, the confederation, and the con&s;titution of the United States.</P>
<P>The report admits, "that, prior to the revolution, the common law was the &s;eparate law of each colony, but not operating through the whole as one &s;ociety; becau&s;e there was no common legi&s;lature or judiciary for the co|lonies." This confounds the term <HI>common</HI> with the term <HI>general,</HI> and argues, from the circum&s;tance of the <HI>un|written law</HI> being called the <HI>common law,</HI> that there could be no common law, becau&s;e there was no general legi|&s;lature
<PB N="29" REF="036760_0028_100AB17CDF8C6A80">or judiciary over all the colonies. This is an abu&s;e of words. It al&s;o confounds principles: for it might as well be contended, that there can be no religion where there is no revelation; and no obligation, where there is no power to enforce it.</P>
<P>What are now the United States were &s;eparate colo|nies, &s;ettled under the authority of England, and, as part of its territory, &s;ubject to its laws: for it is of the nature of colonies, to take with them the laws, rights, and duties of the mother country. The mother country may give its colonies power, more or le&s;s, to make laws for their &s;eparate internal government, or may combine two or more of them in a confederacy, with power to make laws for the confederacy. But the government of the mother country remains the controlling head, and &s;overeign power, in a legi&s;lative and judicial capacity; unle&s;s it deve&s;t it&s;elf of this authority; or until the colo|ny, as in our ca&s;e, grow to &s;uch &s;trength, as to be able to &s;upport it&s;elf, and deny the right and oppo&s;e the force of the mother country. As a colony of England, there|fore, each &s;tate was &s;ubject to the law of England, the general and controlling law of all; except &s;o far as each had authority from England to alter this general law, according as their &s;everal circum&s;tances required.</P>
<P>The law of England is of two kinds written and un|written. The written is called the <HI>&s;tatute law,</HI> becau&s;e compo&s;ed of &s;tatutes or acts of Parliament. The un|written is called the <HI>common law,</HI> becau&s;e founded on an implied common con&s;ent, from long acquie&s;cence in its authority and u&s;e. The authority of both is thus equally the will of the community. The <HI>common law</HI> is founded on the law of nature and the revelation of God, to which all men are &s;ubject; on the law of nations, to which every nation is, as a nation, and the individuals compo&s;ing it, &s;ubject towards every other; and on certain maxims or u&s;ages, which have long prevailed, and been &s;anctioned by judicial authority, as naturally ri&s;ing out of the cir|cum&s;tances by which the &s;ubjects of that government were connected with each other, and therefore impo&s;ing duties on the individuals of that nation towards each
<PB N="30" REF="036760_0029_100AB17F021975D8">other. Of the&s;e maxims or u&s;ages &s;ome are general, and prevail in every part of England; and &s;ome, from the &s;eparate authorities formerly exi&s;ting there, or from other circum&s;tances, are particular, and prevail only in certain parts. Parliament may adopt &s;ome part of this <HI>common law,</HI> and, by putting it in an act of Parliament, make it <HI>&s;tatute law;</HI> or may alter or annul it by act of Parlia|ment. Any part of the common law may al&s;o cea&s;e, or become ob&s;olete, by the circum&s;tances cea&s;ing to exi&s;t, which manife&s;tly were the rea&s;ons of its e&s;tabli&s;hment: and this will be con&s;idered as a repeal by the &s;ame autho|rity which enacted. The colonies, therefore, &s;everally carried with them all the common law of England, which was applicable to their circum&s;tances, with power, &s;o far as given by the mother country to alter this law, by the acts of their &s;everal legi&s;latures. Thus, the circum&s;tances of each colony more or le&s;s differing, and each having a di&s;tinct legi&s;lature; the common law throughout the co|lonies would be, in part, general maxims or u&s;ages pre|vailing in all the colonies; and, in part, maxims or u&s;ages prevailing only in one or &s;everal of the colonies. The government of the mother country was the general &s;u|perintending government.</P>
<P>The declaration of Independance, though it annulled the power of Britain over the colonies, e&s;tabli&s;hed no &s;uperintending government in its room; and each colony became a free and independant &s;tate. But this could not alter any of the law of the &s;everal &s;tates, ex|cept what nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulted from the change of &s;ituation. There was a common law in each &s;tate before the decla|ration of Independence, and it remained after this de|claration.</P>
<P>From every organi&s;ation of individuals, of dome&s;tic or commercial connections, of &s;ocieties, and of govern|ments, certain powers and duties ari&s;e; a &s;ort of common law for the good of all concerned in the organi&s;ation. Men can neither live without law, nor put every law in expre&s;s words. Incidental powers, without being ex|pre&s;&s;ed, re&s;ult from every civil organi&s;ation: for it is the will of tho&s;e concerned that it &s;hould be effectual for its
<PB N="31" REF="036760_0030_100AB181B4BD09A0">purpo&s;es. Thus, before the confederation, which gave the power, Congre&s;s formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">; by a &s;ort of com|mon law, which gave to Congre&s;s, as the only general organ, the authority u&s;ually annexed to &s;uch a govern|ment. The &s;ame idea &s;eems to be expre&s;&s;ed in the report: "In the interval between the commencement of the re|volution, and the final ratification of the articles of con|federation, the nature and extent of the union was de|termined by the circum&s;tances of the cri&s;is." It would not indeed be "alledged, that the common law could have <HI>birth</HI> during that &s;tate of things." It was <HI>born</HI> long before; "in a time whereof the memory of man run|neth not to the contrary." The coloni&s;ts brought it with them from their native land, with their other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for their common protection again&s;t murderers, again&s;t thieves, and again&s;t <HI>libellers;</HI> for the recovery of their debts, the execution of their contracts, and the redre&s;s of their wrongs, The people of every &s;tate modify it according to their &s;everal circum&s;tances; and, &s;o modi|fied, it has been con&s;tantly pre&s;erved, and will be forever pre&s;erved as a rule of right, and &s;tandard of action. There never was a time in any &s;ociety or government, in which a common law did not exi&s;t: it is incidental to the con&s;titution of every regular &s;tate, and in&s;eparable from its exi&s;tence. However the condition of men, &s;ocieties, or governments may be modified; whatever &s;hape or &s;ta|tion they a&s;&s;ume, certain rights, powers, and duties, form|ing a common law, is attached to each.</P>
<P>The confederation was not intended to give any legi|&s;lative or judicial authority to the Federal government, except in a very few in&s;tances. But proving that there exi&s;ted no one general authority over the whole, does not prove, "that the common or unwritten law makes <HI>not</HI> a part of the law of the&s;e &s;tates in their united and national capacity." The confederation altered not the rules or nature of offences, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, or duties: the common law remained as it was, except &s;uch alteration as re&s;ulted from the change in the government.</P>
<P>The la&s;t que&s;tion made by the report on this review of our &s;tate is, <HI>"whether the common law, be introduced as a
<PB N="32" REF="036760_0031_100AB183F3194898">national law by the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States."</HI> Its introduction is admitted, &s;o far as nece&s;&s;arily compre|hended in technical phra&s;es, or nece&s;&s;ary and proper for the execution of given powers; but beyond this its ad|mi&s;&s;ion is denied by the report.</P>
<P>It &s;tates, that from the provi&s;ion of the con&s;titution, "that the judicial power &s;hall extend to all ca&s;es <HI>in law and equity,</HI> ari&s;ing under this con&s;titution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their authority;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article III. Section 2.</NOTE> it had been inferred, that, be&s;ides ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the laws and treaties of the United States, other ca&s;es are pre&s;umed to ari&s;e, by a common law, thus e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution. This inference appears ju&s;t, and little, if at all, different from the admi&s;&s;ion made by the report. Every organi&s;ation of authority mu&s;t have the means of protection and execution of the powers ve&s;ted in it. This is a <HI>common law</HI> in all countries, and in all ca&s;es; and no &s;uppo&s;ition of other po&s;&s;ible or probable con&s;tructions can le&s;&s;en the force of this rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>From the expre&s;&s;ion "ca&s;es in law <HI>and equity,</HI>" and a &s;ub&s;equent expre&s;&s;ion "that the appellate juri&s;diction of the Supreme Court is of law and <HI>fact,</HI>" the report would exclude criminal ca&s;es from federal juri&s;diction; for cri|minal ca&s;es <HI>in equity</HI> would be a language unknown to the law; and the <HI>fact</HI> in criminal ca&s;es is not a &s;ubject of ap|peal.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in a guilty mind and a bad cau&s;e, which will now and then betray it&s;elf. In the manner of Sam&s;on with the Phili&s;tines, we might a&s;k the reporter how he came by the expo&s;ition of this riddle. <HI>"Criminal ca&s;es in equity is a language unknown to the law."</HI> To what law? To the common law &s;urely. <HI>The fact in criminal ca&s;es is not a &s;ubject of appeal.</HI> On what authority is this a&s;&s;erted? Not on the authority of the con&s;titution; for it gives appellate juri&s;diction in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, with exceptions which the report &s;ays "do not mean criminal ca&s;es." It is a&s;&s;erted on the authority of the <HI>common law</HI> only; and yet the report &s;ays <HI>"the common law has no authority under the con&s;titution of the United States!"</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="036760_0032_100AB1861A17C770">
The report having thus palpably admitted the common law as part of the law under the con&s;titution, and hav|ing admitted, that particular parts of the common law comprehended under technical phra&s;es are &s;anctioned by the con&s;titution; the phra&s;e, <HI>all ca&s;es in law and equity</HI> be|ing a common law technical phra&s;e, and adopted in the con&s;titution; we may fairly conclude that under this phra&s;e the common law juri&s;diction of the Federal courts is &s;anctioned.</P>

This appellate juri&s;diction may be as to fact in civil ca&s;es, and as to law in criminal ca&s;es: for it will not be denied, that on a judgment on a conviction in a criminal ca&s;e in an inferior court, a writ of Error will lie in the Supreme Court. And, though, in ca&s;e of an acquittal in a criminal ca&s;e, by the <HI>common law,</HI> a new trial cannot be granted; yet, in ca&s;e of a conviction, a new trial may be granted by the <HI>common law;</HI> and if the inferior court refu&s;e a new trial, the Su|preme Court may have appellate juri&s;diction as to <HI>fact</HI> to grant it, where the conviction is contradicted or not &s;up|ported by evidence.</P>

This opinion is fortified by the amendments to the con&s;titution propo&s;ed by the conventions of &s;ome of the &s;tates, which &s;peak in &s;uch general terms of the trial of crimes, of offences, of all &s;uits at common law, of criminal proceedings by &s;tates; and of making laws touching religion, as &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e general legi&s;lative authority in Congre&s;s, and ge|neral common law juri&s;diction in the courts of the Uni|ted States.</P>
<P>Whenever a government was e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Uni|ted States, with judicial organi&s;ation for the trial of of|fences, there re&s;ulted a common law juri&s;diction in the Federal Courts, over all offences again&s;t the authority of this government. Government, the &s;overeignty, is as it were the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of civil &s;ociety. And, like individuals in a &s;tate of nature, governments in the civil &s;tate will not &s;ubmit their wrongs to the determination of any other, but to them&s;elves alone. Every offence is an offence again&s;t the &s;overeign. The &s;overeign alone examines, tries, judges, puni&s;hes, or pardons it, according to its own or|gani&s;ation. The &s;tate courts cannot try an offence again&s;t the Federal government only: there is no law empow|ering them. Pro&s;ecutions there are in the name of the re&s;pective &s;tates, and puni&s;hed or pardoned by them. The courts of the United States cannot try an offence only again&s;t any of the individual &s;tates. Thus the rights and honour of the &s;everal governments are re&s;pectively re&s;erved to them&s;elves, and full judicial authority ve&s;ted in each for their &s;everal protection.</P>

Confu&s;ion has been introduced into the rea&s;oning of the report by an ambiguous application of the phra&s;e common law, u&s;ing it &s;ometimes as a limit of juri&s;diction, and &s;ometimes as a rule of judgment.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the common law as a limit of juri&s;diction, the Legi&s;lature of the United States, as of every nation, has authority to make all laws nece&s;&s;ary or proper for the defence of its own authority, but no other common law juri&s;diction; and the courts of the United States have authority to determine all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under any law of the United States, and all ca&s;es of mi&s;demeanor, or of|fence again&s;t the authority of the United States. This plainly re&s;ults from the nature of government, and is fairly deducible from the con&s;titution. But the con&s;titu|tion expre&s;sly gives to the courts of the United States a further juri&s;diction, either, on the principles of common law, for the protection of the peace, dignity and autho|rity of the government, as in ca&s;e of certain crimes, and in the ca&s;e of foreign mini&s;ters, and in ca&s;es of maritime law; or for impartiality, as in di&s;putes between citizens of different &s;tates, or for titles derived from different &s;tates.</P>
<P>As a rule of judgment, the <HI>common law,</HI> in all ca&s;es where it is applicable, is an univer&s;al guide to the Judges of the Federal courts. It is no objection to the applica|tion of this rule, <HI>that it may differ in different &s;tates.</HI> The common law of England, &s;o far as it re&s;ts on general and local cu&s;toms, differs in different portions of that territory. The Judges apply it, as it exi&s;ts, as a rule to the ca&s;e before them. The &s;tatute law of each &s;tate may differ; the Federal Judges will apply it, as the courts of the &s;tate having juri&s;diction over the ca&s;e would apply it. So the common law of each &s;tate will be applied by the Judges of the Federal court, as the judges of the &s;tate, having juri&s;diction over the ca&s;e would apply it.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the common law being con&s;idered by the con&s;titution as a guide to the Federal courts, that <HI>this would give it a con&s;titutional e&s;tabli&s;hment, make it part of the con&s;titution, irrevocable by the legi&s;lature.</HI> The con&s;titu|tion con&s;iders the law of each &s;tate, both common and
<PB N="37" REF="036760_0036_100AB18E42C4C938">&s;tatute law, a guide to Federal courts; but leaves all law to be modified by legi&s;lative authority, &s;aving always the paramount authority of the United States. The Fe|deral courts, like the &s;tate courts, mu&s;t take the &s;tatute law of each &s;tate, as it &s;tands in the exi&s;ting &s;tatutes; and the common law of each &s;tate, as it &s;tands in e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;ages and deci&s;ions. Whatever parts of the common law are altered by the change of circum&s;tances of the United States, by the con&s;titution or laws of the United States within their con&s;titutional limits, or by the con&s;ti|tution or laws of the individual &s;tates within their con|&s;titutional limits, will no longer remain law over ca&s;es affected by the alteration.</P>
<P>The picture drawn of the common law, and the diffi|culties and con&s;equences &s;tated in the report, from the introduction of this law into the Federal code, &s;eem &s;o merely the work of a bu&s;y imagination, that any farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them would be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Its preamble declares, that the people of the United States ordained their con&s;titution, "in order to form a more perfect union, e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;tice, en&s;ure dome&s;tic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty;" and from this, an argument was drawn for the power of Congre&s;s to pa&s;s the Sedition-act. The report &s;ays, <HI>"a preamble u&s;ually contains the general motives for the particular mea&s;ures, and is always under&s;tood to be explained and limited by them."</HI> I will &s;ay, that, wherever the body of an in|&s;trument admits of two con&s;tructions, one of which will better than the other promote the intentions expre&s;&s;ed in the preamble, that con&s;truction which will be&s;t promote the intentions is the ju&s;t con&s;truction of the in&s;trument. And it is a le&s;s evil, that the re&s;trictions be not adhered to, in the mo&s;t rigid &s;en&s;e, than that the only govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people with general powers &s;hould, where a rea&s;onable con&s;truction will prevent this, be de|prived of a power nece&s;&s;ary or proper to promote the general welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="036760_0037_100AB19068A797C0">
The con&s;titution enables Congre&s;s "to make all laws, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into exe|cution all powers ve&s;ted by it in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof;" and requires that the Pre&s;ident of the United States "&s;hall take care that the laws be faithfully executed;" and that "the United States, &s;hall protect each &s;tate again&s;t inva|&s;ion and dome&s;tic violence." Hence it has been inferred, that, to enable the Pre&s;ident to take care that the laws are duly executed, and to &s;uppre&s;s in&s;urrections, Congre&s;s has power to make laws to &s;uppre&s;s the means, by which in&s;urrections and ob&s;tructions to the execution of laws are u&s;ually excited; and, as &s;editious libels are the mo&s;t u&s;ual and efficacious means, that Congre&s;s may make laws to &s;uppre&s;s them. All this &s;eems natural and logical enough. But the report &s;ays, <HI>that a power for faithful execution does not imply a power to provide that no oppo&s;ition be promoted; and that a power to protect again&s;t in&s;urrection, does not imply a power to prevent it. There is no doubt that libels on the government will excite in&s;urrections; but government &s;hall not &s;uppre&s;s libels; for it may &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrections. Let the libels go on till they have excited an in&s;urrection, and then the government can take all nece&s;&s;ary and proper mea&s;ures for its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. If then the combination be &s;uch that the government has not force to &s;uppre&s;s it, the government is not to blame; it has u&s;ed con&s;titutional means, and the con&s;titution is overturned in due form.</HI></P>
<P>The report, admitting that the grant of a power in|volves the means of rendering it effectual, <HI>limits tho&s;e means to &s;uch as are &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary for its execution.</HI> It, therefore admits that the grant of the crop growing in a field includes a power to cut down, carry off, and &s;ecure the grain; <HI>but not to repair the fences, nor keep off the cattle from de&s;troying it before it is ripe.</HI></P>
<P>Though Congre&s;s has power to make all laws nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the powers ve&s;ted in the Federal Government, yet the report will not ad|mit that this implies a power to make all laws which <HI>may have a tendency, whether proper or not,</HI> for the execution of &s;uch powers. I &s;hall not di&s;pute this point.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="036760_0038_100AB193B7C2AC68">
Though Congre&s;s has power to make all laws nece&s;&s;ary and <HI>proper</HI> for carrying their powers into execution; yet the report contends, that Congre&s;s &s;hall make no laws but &s;uch as are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for this purpo&s;e. And, if the law which they make or means which they pre&s;cribe be not nece&s;&s;ary, but only proper; they have no authority for the law or the means, and they are invalid; <HI>for the judiciary alone can determine the propriety of the law or the means!</HI></P>
<P>The report has admitted, that a power to puni&s;h im|plies a power to prevent the mi&s;chief. The judiciary will execute their preventive authority, by all the means pre|&s;cribed by law, whether common or &s;tatute law. The legi|&s;lature will execute their preventive power by &s;tatutes. The di&s;cretion of the choice of means, nece&s;&s;ary or pro|per, for executing their powers lies with the legi&s;lature. If the legi&s;lature choo&s;e means palpably unnece&s;&s;ary and improper, the judiciary can then only exerci&s;e their judg|ment, by the authority of con&s;truction of all laws ve&s;ted in this branch of government. But the legi&s;lature of Virginia ought not, in the exerci&s;e of u&s;urped power of judging of the means u&s;ed by the Congre&s;s, or courts of the United States, for the execution of their powers, pre&s;ume them&s;elves wi&s;er than the con&s;tituted autho|rities. A power over the end implies a power over the means; and a power to make laws, for carrying any power into execution, implies a power to make laws for preventing or removing ob&s;tructions to the execution: and it is indifferent, whether tho&s;e ob&s;tructions be acts of violence or acts naturally leading to violence. The ex|perience of other governments, and of our own, has &s;hewn us, that libels on the powers of government are ob&s;tructions to the execution of tho&s;e powers, and natu|rally lead to in&s;urrections. Denying the Federal govern|ment the power of &s;upre&s;&s;ing libels is, therefore, denying it <HI>proper</HI> means, and may be denying it <HI>all</HI> means, of ex|ecuting its powers. For, if the libels proceed, the ob|&s;truction of the powers of government may be too &s;trong for removal. This is ve&s;ting in the people "the holy right of in&s;urrection," while the government is ve&s;ted with the right of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it; and leaving with the
<PB N="40" REF="036760_0039_100AB1954382F8B8">people the be&s;t means of exerci&s;ing their right, while the government is &s;tript of the be&s;t means of exerci&s;ing the right ve&s;ted in it. With &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of powers, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee a very unequal conte&s;t, with very fatal effects; and the mo&s;t &s;ummary exerci&s;e of the people's &s;overeign power over their &s;ervants, that the mo&s;t mo|dern profe&s;&s;or of liberty could de&s;ire. It would indeed bind the government, <HI>hand and foot,</HI> from all re&s;i&s;tance, till, in this condition, the knife was at its throat. This is the end to which the clamours again&s;t the Sedition act and a &s;tanding army naturally tend. If the people would pre&s;erve their government free they have their choice of the alternative; indictments to &s;uppre&s;s &s;edition, or a &s;tanding army to &s;uppre&s;s in&s;urrection. A government, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing force, independent of public opinion, may more &s;afely &s;uffer public opinion to be tampered with. Sam&s;on, while he retained his &s;trength, might &s;lumber in the lap of Delilah, amid&s;t the ambu&s;h of the Phili&s;|tines, or be incircled with the walls of Gaza. Let every government watch where its &s;trength lies, and guard it from corruption. If the &s;trength of a government, as of ours, lie in the opinion of the people, the corruption of public opinion will ruin the government. No injury to public opinion is too &s;light to be overlooked; for every injury to it is a wound in a mortal part. "Lilliputian ties" intwined in Gulliver's hair made him &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, though &s;pears and arrows did him no mate|rial hurt.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> On the re&s;olution, as it re&s;pects the Sedition act the report next &s;tates, that <HI>the power exerci&s;ed by this act is expre&s;sly prohibited by one of the amendments of the con&s;ti|tution.</HI></P>
<P>The amendment or additional article of the con&s;titu|tion here referred to is the third, which provides, "that Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law re&s;pecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e thereof; <HI>or abridging the freedom of &s;peech or of the pre&s;s.</HI>"</P>
<P>The report ob&s;erves, that, "to vindicate the Sedition act it has been contended; 1&s;t. That the <HI>freedom of the pre&s;s</HI> is to be determined by the meaning of this expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="41" REF="036760_0040_100AB196C6FB6250">in the common law; and 2d. that the article &s;uppo&s;es the power over the pre&s;s to be in Congre&s;s, and prohibits them only from <HI>abridging</HI> the freedom allowed to it by the common law."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the report &s;ays, "<HI>It is deemed to be</HI> a <HI>&s;ound opinion, that the &s;edition act, in its definition of &s;ome of the crimes created, is an abridgment of the freedom of publication recogni&s;ed by principles of the common law in En|gland.</HI>" The meaning of this is, that there are offences declared by this act, for which an indictment would not lie at common law. The report prudently declines &s;up|porting this opinion; and I may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that it is not a &s;ound opinion, and that this act does not create any new offence, and that every offence declared by it would have been an offence indictable at common law in the Federal Courts, if this act had never been made, and would be indictable if this act were repealed.</P>
<P>The people of England, and the common law writers there, &s;ay, the pre&s;s is free there; the report &s;ays, it is as free there as here: here and there, it is &s;ubject to no pre|vious re&s;traint; here and there, the abu&s;e of it is, by the common law &s;ubject to penalties. Yet the report will not admit, that the common law idea of the freedom of the pre&s;s is the American idea! The circum&s;tances being com|pleatly the &s;ame, it will &s;urely be incumbent on the au|thor of the report to point out the difference in the <HI>ideas:</HI> and to &s;hew why puni&s;hment of the abu&s;e would not as effectually check the freedom of the pre&s;s <HI>there</HI> as <HI>here.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;agacious contra&s;t <HI>between the principles of the Ame|rican government and the principles of the Briti&s;h government</HI> can give no force to the rea&s;oning in the report, unle&s;s it be meant to e&s;tabli&s;h, that, becau&s;e the &s;overeign Ame|rican people can change their government when they plea&s;e; every individual is at liberty, <HI>by lies and without any ju&s;t rea&s;on,</HI> to incite the people to change their govern|ment whenever <HI>he</HI> plea&s;es. Or unle&s;s it be meant to e&s;ta|bli&s;h, that the American people ought to have le&s;s confi|dence in a Pre&s;ident cho&s;en for four years, than in an hereditary King, or in Senators cho&s;en for &s;ix years, than in an hereditary Hou&s;e of Lords; or in Repre&s;entatives
<PB N="42" REF="036760_0041_100AB19850E98378">cho&s;en for two years, than in members of the Hou&s;e of Commons cho&s;en for &s;even years; or, in a word, that it is more an offence to abu&s;e the government there, than to mi&s;lead the people by abu&s;ing their government here. In any &s;hape in which it is po&s;&s;ible to put his report, its author will be obliged to maintain, that among the rights of the American people, one is, that every individual has a liberty to u&s;e the pre&s;s to produce mi&s;chief, by publi&s;hing fal&s;ehood or indecency. For it is well known, that, as by the common law of England, &s;o by the com|mon law of America, and by the Sedition act; every individual is at liberty to expo&s;e, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, con&s;i&s;tent with decency and truth all the errors of any department of the government.</P>
<P>To contend, <HI>that where the government is elective, there ought to be a liberty of the pre&s;s beyond the bounds of decency and truth;</HI> is to contend, that, where the people have a right to choo&s;e their magi&s;trates, every individual has a right to mi&s;repre&s;ent the character and conduct of the magi&s;trates, to pervert the judgment of the people, and render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to make a right choice. The degree of the re&s;traint ought to be in proportion to the danger of the offence. To mi&s;lead the judgment of the people, where they have no power, may produce no mi&s;chief. To mi&s;lead the judgment of the people, where they have <HI>all</HI> power, mu&s;t produce the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The <HI>"practice, here and in England,"</HI> will not change the law, any more than tre&s;pa&s;&s;es will give a right to the &s;oil. It is po&s;&s;ible, that, both here and there, too much indulgence has been given to libels: but, in either coun|try, when a libel has been tried and found, has the prac|tice prevented a judgment? Not only libels, but thefts, robberies, and murders have been common in both coun|tries; and the trials and puni&s;hments have not been &s;o numerous as the offences. It is not from a corrupt prac|tice, but from a &s;ettled practice allowed by judicial deci|&s;ions, that the common law is to be taken.</P>
<P>That the liberty of the pre&s;s is an excellent engine to de&s;troy a <HI>bad</HI> government, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the
<PB N="43" REF="036760_0042_100AB19AA17AEC40">pre&s;s to de&s;troy <HI>any</HI> government, all experience will con|firm. But where the government is, like ours, founded on the people, I venture to a&s;&s;ert, that a degree of li|berty beyond that given to the pre&s;s by the common law and the Sedition act, will tend only to make the people mi&s;erable, to corrupt and de&s;troy the government, and to introduce anarchy, and, in the end, de&s;poti&s;m. Some means of de&s;troying a bad may not be the means of pre|&s;erving a good government. To pre&s;erve a good govern|ment the confidence of the people is nece&s;&s;ary: but fal&s;ehood, if it may be propagated with impunity, may be as fatal to a good, as truth to a bad government. To pre&s;erve our be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings in an u&s;eful &s;tate, we mu&s;t re&s;train unlimited indulgence. The care and indu&s;try of man mu&s;t be con&s;tantly exerted for a proper enjoyment of the gifts of Providence. To make the fruit of the tree good and abundant, we mu&s;t prune its natural luxu|riance. And to pre&s;erve the liberty, we mu&s;t re&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>When it is known, that our Sedition act, like the com|mon law, forbids the publication of only "fal&s;e, &s;can|dalous and malicious writings again&s;t the government," and permits the publi&s;her, if he can, "to give in evidence the truth of the matter;" every candid mind will regret the mi&s;repre&s;entation in the following &s;entence. "<HI>Had Sedition acts</HI> forbidding <HI>every</HI> publication been uni|formly inforced again&s;t the pre&s;s, <HI>might not the United States have been langui&s;hing at this day under the infirmities of a &s;ickly confederation; or, po&s;&s;ibly, mi&s;erable colonies groaning under a foreign yoak?"</HI> By this the author mu&s;t mean, either that our Sedition act forbids <HI>every</HI> publication again&s;t the go|vernment; or that there is as much ground of cen&s;ure of the government now as before the con&s;titution and revo|lution; or that there would have been no con&s;titution or revolution, if <HI>lies</HI> had not been publi&s;hed of the confede|ration and the Briti&s;h government; or that American juries are not to be tru&s;ted with the examination of truth.</P>
<P>The la&s;t argument in the report on this point is founded on a fallacy. "The freedom of con&s;cience and of reli|gion are the &s;ame by the common law of England, and of America. The difference between the actual freedom
<PB N="44" REF="036760_0043_100AB19E03029970">there and here is made, not by the common law, but by &s;tatutes there; and our con&s;titution re&s;trains Congre&s;s from making <HI>"any"</HI> &s;uch &s;tatute here, "re&s;pecting an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e thereof." The right of con&s;cience is a natural right of a &s;uperior order for the exerci&s;e of which we are an&s;wer|able to God. The right of publication is more within the control of civil authority, and was thought a more proper &s;ubject of general law.</P>
<P>There is nothing therefore in the rea&s;oning of the re|port that can &s;hew, that the meaning of the words <HI>"free|dom of the pre&s;s"</HI> is not to be a&s;certained by the common law. It is a common law phra&s;e. The common law of En|gland is the foundation of our law. Their language is ours. We u&s;e the terms of the Engli&s;h law in the En|gli&s;h &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e terms. And where we mean to re&s;train, enlarge, or alter this &s;en&s;e, we do &s;o in expre&s;s terms. Where this is not done, a law phra&s;e is nearly as well under&s;tood to mean the &s;ame thing here as in England, as a mathematical phra&s;e is &s;o under&s;tood. The freedom of the pre&s;s is plain language, to be under&s;tood in the common acceptance of this term here and in England. There and here ab&s;olute freedom of the pre&s;s did not exi&s;t. In every &s;tate, Libels were puni&s;hable at common law. With this &s;tate of freedom of the pre&s;s, the people were content, and only re&s;train Congre&s;s from <HI>abridging</HI> this freedom. Forbidding power to abridge, implies a previous general power over the &s;ubject, and leaves a power to puni&s;h an abu&s;e of this freedom without abridg|ing it. If this were not &s;o why is there &s;o &s;udden a change in the manner of expre&s;&s;ion in this amendment? Why as re&s;pecting religion, was is not declared that <HI>Con|gre&s;s &s;hall make no law re&s;pecting the freedom of the pre&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>This however is denied by the re&s;olution; and, on ar|guments drawn from di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the con&s;titution pre|vious to its adoption, from propo&s;itions of amendment made by &s;ome of the &s;tate conventions at the time of its adoption, and from the propo&s;ition of amendment made by Congre&s;s after its adoption; the report a&s;&s;erts <HI>"that this amendment is a po&s;itive denial to Congre&s;s of any power whatever on the &s;ubject."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="036760_0044_100AB19F88383B98">
It is very clear, that the power exerci&s;ed by Congre&s;s is not included by this amendment; and I think it has been &s;hewn, that it is fairly involved in powers actually given, and nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from the organization of the government; and that it gives no new juri&s;diction to the Federal courts; for by the common law, the princi|ples of right and wrong, morality, the rules of religion; the criminal courts of every government mu&s;t have ju|ri&s;diction over this offence. A libel is an offence again&s;t all tho&s;e laws, a violation of the rights of man, one of which is reputation, and is puni&s;hed under every govern|ment in the courts of the government offended by it. No evil can ari&s;e from the exerci&s;e of this power by Con|gre&s;s as a general authority: it depends on no local in|formation; the honor and &s;afety of the general govern|ment is involved in it; it is proper, that there &s;hould be a general law uniformly affecting this ca&s;e, and that the courts of the general government injured by the offence, &s;hould be the organs of its correction. Under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, the con&s;truction will be favorable to the power, and an u&s;eful power will not be taken away but by &s;trong and expre&s;s words, and &s;uch do not exi&s;t, in the amendment.</P>
<P>In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the con&s;titution, &s;ome of its oppo|nents may have charged it with powers which it had not, and &s;ome of its advocates may have denied or di&s;&s;embled powers really in it. Each, with perhaps hone&s;t views, may have laboured to carry his point, and if he &s;ucceeded knew that fal&s;e arguments would not affect the determi|nation, and might be forgotten. On &s;imilar ground, many in the &s;tate conventions acceded to the propo&s;itions of amendment. Tho&s;e propo&s;itions gave &s;ome ju&s;tifica|tion, to their arguments; with, or without them, the ratification was equally valid, and they made it more palatable; they were &s;uppo&s;ed harmle&s;s, or, if mi&s;chie|vous, they had no force then, and could be oppo&s;ed again after the con&s;titution was e&s;tabli&s;hed. At any rate a pro|po&s;ition that a thing &s;hould be done, will not control the con&s;truction of the act as done, any more than a pream|ble will control an act. A contract is to be taken not
<PB N="46" REF="036760_0045_100AB1A1B81C70E0">from the previous conver&s;ations of the parties, but from the words in which it is expre&s;&s;ed in the writing. Virgi|nia was but one of the parties, and, admitting that there <HI>might have been,</HI> in the convention of that &s;tate, a de&s;ire to give the Federal government <HI>no power re&s;pecting the pre&s;s;</HI> this might have been contradicted by the other &s;tates. Exclu&s;ive of Rhole I&s;land, &s;ix &s;tates ratified the con&s;ti|tution ab&s;olutely. Three annexed propo&s;itions of amend|ment, but not including this re&s;pecting the pre&s;s, though one of them, New Hamp&s;hire propo&s;ed, that "Congre&s;s &s;hall make no laws touching religion, or to infringe the rights of con&s;cience." And only three &s;tates propo&s;ed the amendment re&s;pecting the pre&s;s. So that the con&s;ti|tution was compleatly ratified without any view to this amendment, and mu&s;t be under&s;tood to give all the pow|ers which this amendment was intended to re&s;train; and the amendment re&s;trains only the power to abridge. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, therefore to &s;hew, as might be done, that the declaration by the Virginia Convention, admitting it &s;incere, is founded on a principle, which, though true, will not &s;upport it. And were it every way &s;upportable, it is &s;u&s;ceptible of a con&s;truction, which would defeat that contended for by the report. It combines two powers with certain attributes, which, <HI>reddendo &s;ingula &s;ingulis</HI> may be taken thus; the liberty of con&s;cience cannot be modi|fied, and the liberty of the pre&s;s cannot be abridged, by authority of the United States. But in any con&s;truction, how can a law, which only abridges the unlimited de|gree of puni&s;hment for abu&s;e of the pre&s;s, be &s;aid to modify the liberty of the pre&s;s?</P>
<P>The author of the report mu&s;t have known that the Virginia Convention in endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h the li|berty of the pre&s;s, under&s;tood this liberty as every one el&s;e does to be a liberty from previous re&s;traint and not from &s;ub&s;equent penalties for its abu&s;e; and did not un|der&s;tand it in the &s;en&s;e contended for by him in the report, <HI>a freedom from all re&s;traint previous and &s;ub&s;equent</HI> and by him &s;aid to be the &s;en&s;e of the Virginia Convention. "A law inflicting penalties on printed publications would," &s;ays the report, "have a &s;imilar effect with a law authori&s;ing a previous re&s;traint." Now this Virginia Convention.
<PB N="47" REF="036760_0046_100AB1A48BA844A8">together with the amendment on the freedom of the pre&s;s, propo&s;es an amendment, "That every freeman ought to find a certain remedy by recour&s;e to the laws for all injuries and wrongs he may receive in his per&s;on, property, <HI>or character.</HI>" If for all injuries to his chracter, he ought e&s;pecially to find a remedy for the wor&s;t of all a libel. A verdict in an action for damages may be (and we have a late remarkable in&s;tance of it) a &s;everer penalty than any that would probably be inflicted by a &s;entence on an indictment; it may be a &s;everer penalty than can be inflicted by the Sedition act. Yet this Virginia Con|vention, which, the report &s;ays meant to make the pre&s;s free from all re&s;traint previous and &s;ub&s;equent, &s;ubjects it to this &s;ub&s;equent penalty at common law without limi|tation. If the opinion of the Virginia Convention were material on this point, it appears, that it never meant to leave the pre&s;s free from all re&s;traints for abu&s;e. And (&s;ince the report will argue from the opinion of Conven|tions) it appears from this and other amendments propo|&s;ed, that a general legi&s;lative authority was &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in Congre&s;s, and a general common law juri&s;diction in the courts of the United States. And it appears that the Virginia Convention believed, that without the pro|po&s;ed amendment which I have cited, Congre&s;s might make a law, denying the right of action for a libel, and therefore might make a law re&s;pecting the freedom of the pre&s;s; and that the Federal Courts might deny that an action lies for a libel, and, therefore, that they had com|mon law juri&s;diction, by which alone &s;uch action could be brought before them.</P>
<P>The preamble to the propo&s;ition of amendment by Congre&s;s is no evidence that the amendment declared the pre&s;s to be wholly exempt from the power of Congre&s;s. There are other amendments propo&s;ed, <HI>which might corre|&s;pond with the de&s;ire of the &s;tates, and might extend the ground of public confidence.</HI> This amendment was de&s;ired only by three &s;tates. If it was the intention of Congre&s;s to &s;atisfy the de&s;ire of tho&s;e &s;tates, by propo&s;ing this amendment, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed that they propo&s;ed it in terms corre|&s;ponding with the de&s;ire. None of the&s;e &s;tates ever de|&s;ired
<PB N="48" REF="036760_0047_100AB1A6AE37A658">that the licentiou&s;ne&s;s or abu&s;e of the pre&s;s &s;hould not be re&s;trained or puni&s;hed; and Virginia expre&s;sly de|&s;ired the contrary. They de&s;ired that the freedom of the pre&s;s &s;hould not be violated or re&s;trained. By the free|dom of the pre&s;s, they mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean the freedom of the pre&s;s as it then exi&s;ted at common law in all the &s;tates. The amendment corre&s;ponds with this de&s;ire, and the Sedition law with this amendment, for it neither violates nor abridges the freedom of the pre&s;s in the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;en&s;e of that expre&s;&s;ion. The intention of tho&s;e who made the amendment mu&s;t be collected from the plain meaning of the words u&s;ed in it. Some may have intended greater re&s;traint, and others le&s;s: the que&s;tion is what is done. <HI>Congre&s;s mu&s;t leave the freedom of the pre&s;s as it was. There &s;hall be no previous re|&s;traints on this freedom; but there may be &s;ub&s;equent penalties on the abu&s;e of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> The la&s;t point di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in this re&s;olution is, <HI>"that the power exerci&s;ed by Congre&s;s, in this act, ought, more than any other, to produce univer&s;al alarm, becau&s;e levelled again&s;t that right of free examination of public characters and mea&s;ures, and free communication thereon, which has ever been ju&s;tly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.</HI></P>
<P>On this point, the report, having &s;tated part of the act, makes various ob&s;ervations on it.</P>
<P><HI>"The con&s;titution &s;uppo&s;es that the Pre&s;ident, the Congre&s;s, and each of its Hou&s;es may not di&s;charge their tru&s;ts. Hence they are made re&s;pon&s;ible to their con&s;tituents, at the returning periods of election. Should it happen, that either of the&s;e branches has not di&s;charged its tru&s;t, it is proper, that according to the degree of their faults, they &s;hould be brought into contempt and hatred of the people. Whether this has happened, can only be determined by a free examination and communication among the people. And whenever it has happened, it is the right and duty of intelligent and faithful citizens, to di&s;cu&s;s and promulge it freely, as well, for control, as for remedy; and tho&s;e who are to apply the remedy mu&s;t feel a contempt or hatred again&s;t the transgre&s;&s;ing party. During the continuance of this act, two elections of the entire Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, an election of two-thirds of the Senate, and an election of a Pre&s;ident were
<PB N="49" REF="036760_0048_100AB1A8315764B8">to take place: and, during all the&s;e elections, the remedial rights of the people were to be exerci&s;ed, and the re&s;pon&s;ibility of their public agents to be &s;kreened under the penalties of this act."</HI></P>
<P>Who, reading the&s;e ob&s;ervations, would not &s;uppo&s;e, that the people of the United States were by this <HI>alarm|ing &s;edition-act,</HI> re&s;trained from a free and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the public conduct of their public agents, with an hone&s;t intent of bringing them into di&s;repute when they de&s;erved it? But does this act forbid this? No: it forbids, as the report it&s;elf &s;hews, "a knowingly and willingly publi&s;hing a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious writing, with intent to defame the government," &amp;c. Do the peo|ple of the United States wi&s;h to retain a right, wilfully, maliciou&s;ly, and fal&s;ely, to publi&s;h &s;candal again&s;t their officers? Is this one of the rights of man under a free government? Does the re&s;traint of this right alarm them? Or have they made a con&s;titution to protect it?</P>
<P>It is evident, that the freedom contended for in the&s;e ob&s;ervations and the report generally, is a freedom from all re&s;traint; &s;ub&s;equent, as well as previous; from the &s;tate governments, as well as from the Federal govern|ment; from action, as well as from indictment. For "it is equally a re&s;traint" (&s;ays the report) "whether it pre|cede or follow the publication; and &s;o is it equally a penalty, whether a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a jury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Virginia Juries a&s;&s;e&s;s fines.</NOTE> or by a court, by a &s;tate court or by a Federal court. This freedom is a con|tradiction to all experience, to common under&s;tanding, to natural ju&s;tice, to the rules of religion, and to the judicial deci&s;ions of every &s;tate. It is a violation of the rights of man, one of the deare&s;t of which is reputation.</P>
<P>The Sedition act enables the per&s;on pro&s;ecuted for a libel, "to give in evidence the <HI>truth</HI> of the matter con|tained in it," and enables the jury "to determine the law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other ca&s;es." But the report &s;ays, <HI>"its baneful tendency is little dimini&s;hed by this privilege."</HI> And why is its bane|ful tendency not dimini&s;hed? Why is it not entirely re|moved? Becau&s;e a re&s;traint from publi&s;hing truth would
<PB N="50" REF="036760_0049_100A8A3A249EEC78">have a baneful tendency; is there any baneful tendency to re&s;train the publication of fal&s;ehood? Becau&s;e the pre&s;s ought to be permitted to publi&s;h every truth in|tere&s;ting to the public; ought it to be permitted to pub|li&s;h every lie? Becau&s;e "an intelligent and faithful citi|zen" has a right, hone&s;tly, decently, and freely, to examine the public conduct of every officer, and, by ex|po&s;ing the truth, expo&s;e the officer to contempt and ha|tred; has every impudent or malicious man a right, wil|fully, fal&s;ely, and &s;candalou&s;ly to defame every officer. It is not a free, but a fal&s;e publication that is prohibited by this act.</P>
<P>But it is objected by the report, that, <HI>"where &s;imple and naked facts alone are in que&s;tion, there is &s;ufficient difficulty of meeting a pro&s;ecution from government with the proof nece&s;|&s;ary in a court of law."</HI> This will infer, that in order to &s;ave offenders from the trouble of producing the nece&s;|&s;ary proof in their defence, there &s;hould be no pro&s;ecu|tions, but a general impunity for crimes, for murders, rapes, robberies, thefts, mi&s;demeanors in office, &amp;c. Libels of public officers, where the people have a right of election, are offences of great magnitude and dange|rous tendency. And it is as &s;afe for a per&s;on accu&s;ed of a libel to have the accu&s;ation tried by a jury, as for a per&s;on accu&s;ed of any other offence.</P>
<P>As to <HI>"opinions, inferences, and conjectural ob&s;ervations,"</HI> they mu&s;t be drawn from facts. If a man wilfully, ma|liciou&s;ly, and with intent to defame, publi&s;h an opinion not &s;upported by fact, it is an offence. If there be fact to ju&s;tify it, he may give it in evidence. If there be none, why &s;hould not a wilful, fal&s;e, and malicious in|ference be a libel, as well as a wilful, fal&s;e and malicious a&s;&s;ertion. The inference implies the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>As to the intent to defame, the report rea&s;ons ab&s;urd|ly, <HI>"that in proportion to the guilt of the officer will be the cer|tainly and criminality of the intent to defame him."</HI> Nothing like this can be drawn from the act. The intent to de|fame is never criminal, where the matter of the accu&s;a|tion is true. All depends on the truth or fal&s;ehood of the matter of the publication. If the publication of the
<PB N="51" REF="036760_0050_100AB1ADB5941C38">officer's official conduct be true, the intent to defame, however malicious will not make the publication a libel. So that the intent to defame is not criminal unle&s;s the publication be fal&s;e; and is criminal in proportion to the innocence or merit of the officer. There is good rea&s;on why the authors of publications again&s;t officers &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible, that they publi&s;h nothing but truth. For if fal&s;ehood might be publi&s;hed of officers, and the publi&s;hers were liable to no re&s;traint, the whole of an officer's time might be taken up in examining or refu|ting &s;lander; or the people concerned in the officer's cha|racter might be mi&s;led by fal&s;e information.</P>
<P>No le&s;s ab&s;urd, and more pernicious in its application, is the rea&s;oning of the report, from <HI>"the right of electing the members of the government."</HI> It proceeds on a confu|&s;ion of freedom with fal&s;ehood; as if a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion could not be free, without being fal&s;e, or the re&s;traint of a fal&s;e were a re&s;traint of a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. If <HI>"the value and efficacy of the right of election depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the candidates"</HI> the greater ought to be the re&s;traint on fal&s;ehood in exami|ning their character. A free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will not be pre|tended to include a fal&s;e one: it means a full and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A full and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is not forbidden by the Sedition act. It forbids only a fal&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with a malicious intent. It forbids not diffu&s;ing information, but diffu&s;ing corruption, among the people; mi&s;leading their judgment, and &s;educing them from their duty. It puts not the officer in a &s;tate of greater protection than the citizen. Any truth may be publi&s;hed of the officer, which may be publi&s;hed of the citizen; and every truth may be publi&s;hed of the official character of the officer. Would the committee de&s;ire more? Becau&s;e a man is an officer, &s;hall every &s;lander of him be publi&s;hed with im|punity? Becau&s;e Mr. Adams is Pre&s;ident of the United States, &s;hall leave be given to mi&s;lead the people, by publi&s;hing fal&s;ehood or &s;lander of him; in order that another candidate, not in &s;uch re&s;pon&s;ible &s;tation, may be on equal terms for a chance of election to that office!</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="036760_0051_100AB1B068A4FFB0">
A free means not a fal&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, any more than the liberty, means the abu&s;e, of the pre&s;s. The greate&s;t injury "<HI>to the right of election,</HI>" and the greate&s;t dan|ger to "<HI>the ble&s;&s;ings of a government founded on this right,</HI>" is &s;lander; which perverts the opinions and choice of the people, and leads them to prefer bad to good men. In proportion to the freedom of the government ought to be re&s;traint on libels. And the &s;edition-act no farther abridges the liberty of the pre&s;s, than by declaring that fal&s;e publications are &s;ubject to penalties.</P>
<P>To whom then is the &s;edition-act <HI>alarming?</HI> To &s;lan|derers, to libellers, to robbers of reputation, to di&s;tur|bers of the peace, to violaters of the rights of man. It is, as law ought to be, <HI>"a terror only to evil doers."</HI></P>
<P>The three following re&s;olutions and the report on them contain only matter le&s;s important or already con&s;i|dered. Perhaps Penn&s;ylvania de&s;erves the rebuke which may be implied in the declaration of the patrioti&s;m of Virginia, in "<HI>maintaining the authority and laws of the Union, without a &s;ingle exception of internal re&s;i&s;tance of com|motion.</HI> And while I cheerfully give all due prai&s;e to the people of Virginia for this uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I cannot allow any &s;hare of this merit to the authors or promoters of the re&s;olutions or the report. And of the people, for this re&s;pect for public authority, we &s;hall find room to prai&s;e not only the patrioti&s;m but the pru|dence. There is among them a force, which, if the bands of public authority were relaxed might be fatal indeed.</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions conclude as they commenced, with a profe&s;&s;ion of affection for the &s;tates, and anxiety for the Union. I will not &s;ay (for they profe&s;s otherwi&s;e) that the object of the re&s;olutions is to di&s;&s;olve the Union; but I may with little hazard of contradiction, &s;ay, that they are (e&s;pecially accompanied with the report) well calculated for this purpo&s;e. On the ground that <HI>"a wilful and material breach of a part is a breach of the whole compact; having deliberately determined that palpable and alarming infractions of the con&s;titution have been made;"</HI> they lay a &s;ufficient foundation for the di&s;&s;olution of the Uni|on
<PB N="53" REF="036760_0052_100AB1B1EC762808">And I will &s;ay al&s;o, that, in making this deliberate and &s;olemn determination, the legi&s;lature of Virginia is mi&s;taken, and has u&s;urped a power not given to it by the people; but given to the judiciary, or re&s;erved to the people them&s;elves, as parties to the compact, in their highe&s;t &s;overeign capacity. This is a deliberate, palpable, dangerous, and alarming exerci&s;e of powers not granted by the con&s;titution: for the powers of the legi&s;lature of Virginia are no farther valid, than they are authori&s;ed by the con&s;titutions of that &s;tate and of the Union.

<P>When I wrote what is &s;aid in page 12 of the opinion of General Wa&s;hington, on the power of Congre&s;s to provide for the general welfare, I alluded to this opinion as officially delivered to Congre&s;s. I had not then &s;een his will giving a donation to A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, in the hope that Congre&s;s would e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an in&s;ti|tution. This is a deliberate declaration of a WISE and VIRTUOUS man, in whom LOVE of COUNTRY was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion; made in the full &s;trength of this pa&s;&s;ion, in a &s;olemn moment when he was preparing to part with all earthly things, and to meet his GOD.</P>
