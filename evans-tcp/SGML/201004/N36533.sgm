<P>ALL wi&s;dom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever. Who can number the &s;ands of the &s;ea, or the drops of rain and the days of eternity? Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the

The word of God mo&s;t high is the fountain of wi&s;dom. To whom hath the root of wi&s;|dom been made manife&s;t, or who hath known her wi&s;e councils, or under&s;tood her great experience? There is one wi&s;e and greatly to be feared; the Lord &s;itteth up|on his throne, he created her, and &s;aw her, and poured her out upon all his works. She is with all fle&s;h, ac|cording to his gift; he hath given her to them that love him and as God has promi&s;ed, 'Seek and ye &s;hall find, a&s;k and it &s;hall be given unto you.' For &s;ecret things are with him, and none can find out the Almighty to perfection; for there was no man on earth or &s;aint in heaven worthy to open the book or unloo&s;e the &s;eals. (Rv. v. 5.) Behold the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and unloo&s;e the &s;even feals thereof; which doth open unto his &s;ervants his mind, and will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> he makes them, his in&s;truments for the doing of his work, in building his &s;piritual tem|ple of lively &s;tones, fitted and prepared by grace, and laid on the corner &s;tone, a &s;trong foundation, the rock of eternal ages, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;on of God, as So|lomon's wi&s;dom and glory, and the magnificency of the hou&s;e he built typified. (1 Kings ii. 45.) And King Solomon &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed, and the throne of David &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before the Lord forever. And we &s;ee how wonderfully the Lord ble&s;&s;ed him to make him king in&s;tead of his father David, to reign in I&s;rael, and to bring a change of the times from wars and de&s;olations, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a peaceable kingdom; and for this pur|po&s;e the Lord appeared to him. (1 Kings iii. 5.) In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God &s;aid, 'A&s;k what I &s;hall give thee.' Upon this Solomon begins to expre&s;s with all his heart filled with thankfulne&s;s for the great mercies he had given his father, and that he had given him a &s;on to &s;et on his throne, breaks forth into prayer and prai&s;e, and acknowledges him&s;elf unable, being but a little child.

Now in Shu&s;han, the palace, there was a certain Jew, who&s;e name was Mordecai, and he brought up E&s;ther as his own daughter; and al&s;o there was man who&s;e name was Haman, which the king had promoted; and all the &s;ervants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman.

And when Mordecai perceived all that was done, he rent his clothes, and put on &s;ackcloth with a&s;hes, and went out into the mid&s;t of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry, even before the king's gate, and in every province where the king's letters came, that declared their death, there was a great mourning, fa&s;ting, and weeping, and wailing in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes; and Mordecai &s;hewed it unto E&s;ther, and commanded that &s;he &s;hould go in unto the king, and make &s;upplication unto him, and to make reque&s;t for her peo|ple: and E&s;ther returned an an&s;wer to Mordecai, &s;ay|ing, Gather all the Jews, and fa&s;t for me; neither eat nor drink, three days; and I will go in unto the king, which is not according to the law, and if I peri&s;h I peri&s;h. And &s;o the King and Haman came to ban|quet with E&s;ther; and when the book of records was read before the king, it was made known of a &s;ecret of two chamberlains, who &s;ought to take the king's life, which Mordecai had made known, which gave him favour with the king; and al&s;o Haman's wickedne&s;s was revealed by E&s;ther to the king: and the king granted the queen's petition for the deliverance of her people; and the adver&s;ary, wicked Haman, was con|demned and hanged on the gallows of fifty cubits high, that he had erected for Mordecai: &s;o the Jews received a great deliverance, and kept the fourteenth day of the month Adar, a day of gladne&s;s and fea&s;ting and a good day, and of &s;ending of portions one to another.</P>

But &s;o far I determine, that if the ten days of tribulation and impri&s;onment is ten years, which is in Rev. ii. 10; then, from one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety, when the wars begun in France for the de&s;truction of Popery and all the Antichri&s;tian powers: Then the fall of the Bea&s;t will be in the year eighteen hundred of Satan's binding. Then Michael &s;hall deliver I&s;rael from all their troubles. (Dan. xii. 1.)

Then the way of the kings of the Ea&s;t will be prepar|ed; then the glories of the go&s;pel will take the wings of the morning, and fly unto the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth. (I&s;a. lx. 10.) And the &s;ons of &s;trangers &s;hall build up thy walls, and their kings &s;hall mini&s;ter unto thee; and that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles; and that their kings may be brought; and kings &s;hall be nur&s;ing fathers, and queens nur&s;ing mothers, and the church for the nation that will not &s;erve thee, &s;hall peri&s;h.

<L>Some years ago I remember well,</L>
<L>A judgment plague, a &s;tink in&s;tead of &s;weet &s;mell,</L>

<L>And regarded not the judgment God had &s;ent;</L>
<L>A greater one may be hanging over head,</L>
<L>Of eternal death that will &s;trike you dead.</L>
<L>Many families went out of town and left the place;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e you had de&s;pis'd God's grace.</L>
<L>With powder'd heads, a gaudy &s;how,</L>
<L>With tinkling feet to church doth go;</L>
<L>With je&s;ting tales of gallant life,</L>
<L>Spending your days in wicked &s;trife.</L>
<L>Thou&s;ands the Lord's &s;word has cut down,</L>
<L>In mould'ring graves, no more in town.</L>
<L>Some &s;icken and die at dancing ball,</L>
<L>No more nimble footed at cloven-foot's hall?</L>
<L>Her vital tuning-&s;trings are broke,</L>
<L>That twine the heart, receives a &s;troke,</L>
<L>And gone away on Apollion's hump'd back,</L>
<L>And left behind their merry fidler Jack.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Georgic merchants, your horrid negro trade,</L>
<L>You oppre&s;s the creatures God has made;</L>
<L>Like I &s;hmaelites 20 &s;ilver pieces gave t'increa&s;e their &s;tore,</L>
<L>Traitor Judas &s;old Chri&s;t for ten pieces more.</L>
<L>You lavi&s;h gold in bag and wrap it up,</L>
<L>Drunkards love their bottle, and drink a large &s;up.</L>
<L>You that have negroes, Wills, and Jacks,</L>
<L>Feed their bellies and cloath their backs;</L>
<L>Clothe their bodies from the winter &s;torm,</L>
