<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FOR many Years I have had a De&s;ire of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tting down and laying together, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t has occured to my Mind, either in Reading, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hinking, or Conver&s;a|tion, which might a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;erious Per&s;ons, who have not the Advantage of Learning, in under&s;tanding the New Te&s;tament. But I have been continually deterred from attempting any Thing of this Kind, by a deep Sen&s;e of my own Inability: Of my Want not only of Learn|ing for &s;uch a Work, but much more of Experience and Wi&s;dom. This has often occa&s;ioned my laying a&s;ide the Thought. And when by much Importunity I have been prevailed upon to re&s;ume it, &s;till I determined to delay it as long as po&s;&s;ible, that (if it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD) I might fini&s;h my Work and my Life together.</P>
<P N="2">2. But having lately had a loud Call from GOD, to ari&s;e and go hence, I am convinced that, if I attempt any Thing of this Kind at all, I mu&s;t not delay any longer. My Day is far &s;pent, and (even in a natural Way) the Shadows of the Evening come on apace. And I am the rather induced to do what little I can in this Way, becau&s;e I can do nothing el&s;e: Being pre|vented by my pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s, from either Travel|ling or Preaching. But, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, I can &s;till read, and write, and think. O that it may be to his Glory!</P>
<P N="3">3. It will be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, even from what I have &s;aid already, and much more from the Notes them|&s;elves, that they were not principally de&s;igned for Men of Learning; who are provided with many other Helps: And much le&s;s for Men of long and deep Ex|perience in the Ways and Word of GOD. I de&s;ire to &s;it at their Feet, and to learn of them. But I write chiefly for plain, unlettered Men, who under&s;tand only their Mother-Tongue, and yet reverence and love
<PB N="iv" REF="023976_0004_0FC2A545B6DC3468">the Word of GOD, and have a De&s;ire to &s;ave their Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the&s;e in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure as I am able, I de&s;ign fir&s;t to &s;et down the Text it&s;elf, for the mo&s;t Part, in the common <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation, which is in general (&s;o far as I can judge) abundantly the be&s;t that I have &s;een. Yet I do not &s;ay it is incapa|ble of being brought in &s;everal Places nearer to the Original. Neither will I affirm, That the <HI>Greek</HI> Co|pies from which this Tran&s;lation was made, are always the mo&s;t correct. And therefore I &s;hall take the Li|berty, as Occa&s;ion may require, to make here and there a &s;mall Alteration.</P>
<P N="5">5. I am very &s;en&s;ible this will be liable to Objections: Nay, to Objections of quite oppo&s;ite Kinds. Some will probably think, the Text is altered too much; and others, that it is altered too little. To the for|mer I would ob&s;erve, That I have never knowingly, &s;o much as in one Place, altered it, for Altering's Sake: But there, and there only, where, Fir&s;t, The Sen&s;e was made better, &s;tronger, clearer, or more con|&s;i&s;tent with the Context: Secondly, Where the Sen&s;e being equally good, the Phra&s;e was better or nearer the Original. To the latter, who think the Altera|tions too few, and that the Tran&s;lation might have been nearer &s;till, I an&s;wer, This is true; I acknow|ledge it might. But what valuable End would it have an&s;wered, to multiply &s;uch trivial Alterations, as add neither Clearne&s;s nor Strength to the Text? This I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to do: So much the le&s;s, becau&s;e there is, to my Apprehen&s;ion, I know not what, peculiarly &s;olemn and venerable in the Old Lan|guage of our Tran&s;lation. And &s;uppo&s;e this to be a mi&s;taken Apprehen&s;ion, and an In&s;tance of human In|firmity; yet is it not an excu&s;able Infirmity, to be un|willing to part with what we have been long accu&s;|tomed to, and to love the very Words, by which GOD has often conveyed Strength or Comfort to our Souls?</P>
<P N="6">6. I have endeavoured to make the Notes as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, that the Comment may not ob&s;cure or &s;wallow up the Text: And as plain as po&s;&s;ible, in Pur|&s;uance of my main De&s;ign, To a&s;&s;i&s;t the unlearned Read|er:
<PB N="v" REF="023976_0005_0FC2A549771549B0">For this Rea&s;on I have &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided, not only all curious and critical Enquiries, and all U&s;e of the learned Languages, but all &s;uch Methods of Rea|&s;oning and Modes of Expre&s;&s;ion, as People in com|mon Life are unacquainted with: For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, as I rather endeavour to obviate than to propo&s;e and an&s;wer Objections, &s;o I purpo&s;ely decline going deep into many Difficulties, le&s;t I &s;hould leave the ordinary Reader behind me.</P>
<P N="7">7. I once de&s;igned to write down, barely what occurred to my own Mind, con&s;ulting none but the in&s;pired Writers. But no &s;ooner was I acquainted with that great Light of the Chri&s;tian World (lately gone to his Reward) <HI>Bengelius,</HI> than I entirely changed my De&s;ign, being throughly convinced, it might be of more Service to the Cau&s;e of Religion, were I barely to tran&s;late his <HI>Gnomon Novi Te&s;tamenti,</HI> than to write many Volumes upon it. Many of his excellent Notes I have therefore tran&s;lated. Many more I have abridged; omitting that Part which was purely critical, and giving the Sub&s;tance of the re&s;t. Tho&s;e various Readings likewi&s;e which he has &s;hewed to have a va&s;t Majority of ancient Copies and Tran&s;lations on their Side, I have without Scruple incorporated with the Text: Which after his Manner I have divided all along (tho' not omitting the common Divi&s;ion into Chapters and Ver&s;es, which is of U&s;e on various Ac|counts) according to the Matter it contains, making a larger or &s;maller Pau&s;e, ju&s;t as the Sen&s;e requires. And even this is &s;uch an Help in many Places, as one who has not tried it can &s;carcely conceive.</P>
<P N="8">8. I am likewi&s;e indebted for &s;ome u&s;eful Ob&s;erva|tions, to Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s <HI>Theological Lectures:</HI> And for many more to Dr. <HI>Guy&s;e,</HI> and to the <HI>Family Expo&s;itor</HI> of the late pious and learned Dr. <HI>Doddridge.</HI> It was a Doubt with me for &s;ome Time, whether I &s;hould not &s;ubjoin to every Note I received from them, the Name of the Author from whom it was taken; e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing I had tran&s;cribed &s;ome, and abridged many more, almo&s;t in the Words of the Author. But upon farther Con&s;ideration, I re&s;olved to name none, that nothing might divert the Mind of the Reader from keeping
<PB N="vi" REF="023976_0006_0FC2A5566C385BB8">clo&s;e to the Point in View, and receiving what was &s;poke, only according to its own intrin&s;ic Value.</P>
<P N="9">9. I cannot flatter my&s;elf &s;o far (to u&s;e the Words of one of the above-named Writers) as to imagine that I have fallen into no Mi&s;takes, in a Work of &s;o great Difficulty. But my own Con&s;cience acquits me of having de&s;ignedly mi&s;repre&s;ented any &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, or of having written one Line, with a Pur|po&s;e of inflaming the Hearts of Chri&s;tians again&s;t each other. GOD forbid that I &s;hould make the Words of the mo&s;t gentle and benevolent JESUS, a Vehicle to convey &s;uch Poi&s;on. Would to GOD that all the Party Names, and un&s;criptural Phra&s;es and Forms, which have divided the Chri&s;tian World, were forgot: And that we might all agree to &s;it down together, as humble, loving Di&s;ciples, at the Feet of our common Ma&s;ter, to hear his Word, to imbibe his Spirit, and to tran&s;cribe his Life in our own!</P>
<P N="10">10. Concerning the Scriptures in general, it may be ob&s;erved, the Word of the Living GOD, which directed the fir&s;t Patriarchs al&s;o, was, in the Time of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> committed to Writing. To this were added, in &s;everal &s;ucceeding Generations, the in&s;pired Wri|tings of the other Prophets. Afterwards, what the Son of GOD preached, and the HOLY GHOST &s;pake by the Apo&s;tles, the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts wrote. This is what we now &s;tile the <HI>Holy Scripture:</HI> This is that <HI>Word of</HI> GOD <HI>which remaineth for ever:</HI> Of which, tho' <HI>Heaven and Earth pa&s;s away, one Jot or Tittle &s;hall not pa&s;s away.</HI> The Scripture therefore of the <HI>Old and New Te&s;tament,</HI> is a mo&s;t &s;olid and precious Sy&s;tem of Divine Truth. Every Part thereof is worthy of GOD; and all together are one entire Body, wherein is no Defect, no Exce&s;s. It is the Fountain of heavenly Wi&s;dom, which they who are able to ta&s;te, prefer to all Writings of Men, however wi&s;e, or learned, or holy.</P>
<P N="11">11. An exact Knowledge of the Truth was accom|panied in the in&s;pired Writers with an exactly regular Series of Arguments, a preci&s;e Expre&s;&s;ion of their Mean|ing, and a genuine Vigour of &s;uitable Affections. The Chain of Argument in each Book is briefly exhibited in
<PB N="vii" REF="023976_0007_0FC2A55B2FF85D70">the Table pre&s;ixt to it, which contains al&s;o the Sum thereof, and may be of more U&s;e, than prefixing the Argument to each Chapter; the Divi&s;ion of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> into Chapters, having been made in the dark Ages, and very incorrectly; often &s;eparating Things that are clo&s;ely joined, and joining tho&s;e that are en|tirely di&s;tinct from each other.</P>
<P N="12">12. In the Language of the Sacred Writings, we may ob&s;erve the utmo&s;t Depth, together with the utmo&s;t Ea&s;e. All the Elegancies of human Compo|&s;ures &s;ink into nothing before it: GOD &s;peaks not as Man, but as GOD. His Thoughts are very deep; and thence his Words are of inexhau&s;tible Virtue. And the Language of his Me&s;&s;engers al&s;o is exact in the higne&s;t Degree: For the Words which were given them, accurately an&s;wered the Impre&s;&s;ion made upon their Minds: and hence <HI>Luther</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Divinity is nothing but a Grammar of the Language of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> To under&s;tand this throughly, we &s;hould ob&s;erve the <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> which lies on every Word; the holy <HI>Affections</HI> expre&s;t thereby, and the <HI>Tempers</HI> &s;hewn by every Writer. But how little are the&s;e, the latter e&s;pecially, regarded? Tho' they are wonderfully diffu&s;ed thro' the whole <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> and are in Truth a continued Commendation of Him, who acts, or &s;peaks, or writes.</P>
<P N="13">13. The <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> is, all tho&s;e Sacred Writings in which the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> or Covenant is de&s;eribed. The former Part of this contains the Writings of the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles: The latter, the Revelation of JESUS CHRIST. In the former is, fir&s;t, the Hi&s;tory of JESUS CHRIST, from his Coming in the Fle&s;h, to his A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven; then, the In&s;titution and Hi&s;tory of the Chri&s;tian Church, from the Time of his A&s;cen&s;ion. The Revelation delivers what is to be, with regard to CHRIST, the Church, and the Uni|ver&s;e, till the Con&s;ummation of all Things.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> (that is, Good Tidings) means a Book containing the Good Tidings of our Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Mark</HI> in his Go&s;pel pre&s;uppo&s;es that of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and &s;up|plies what is omitted therein. St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;upplies what is omitted by both the former: St. <HI>John</HI> what is omitted by all the three.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Matthew</HI> particularly points out the fulfilling of the Prophecies for the Conviction of the Jews. St. <HI>Mark</HI> wrote a &s;hort Compendium, and yet added many remarkable Circum&s;tances omitted by St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> particularly with regard to the Apo&s;tles, immediately after they were called. St. <HI>Luke</HI> treated principally of the Office of Chri&s;t, and mo&s;tly in an hi&s;torical Manner. St. <HI>John</HI> refuted tho&s;e who denied his God-head: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h chu&s;ing to treat more largely on tho&s;e Things, which mo&s;t &s;uited the Time when, and the Per&s;ons to whom he wrote.</P>

<P>Our LORD in this whole Parable &s;hews, not only that the Jews had no Cau&s;e to murmur at the Reception of the Gentiles (a Point which did not at that Time &s;o directly fall under Con&s;ideration) but that if the Phari&s;ees were indeed as good as they &s;ancied them&s;elves to be, &s;till they had no Rea&s;on to murmur at the kind Treatment of any &s;incere Penitent. Thus does He condemn them, even on their own Principles, and &s;o leaves them without Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>We have in this Parable a lively Emblem of the Condition and Behaviour of Sinners in their natural State. Thus, when inriched by the Bounty of the great common Father, do they ungratefully run from him (ver. 12.) Sen&s;ual Plea&s;ures are eagerly pur&s;ued, till they have &s;quandered away all the Grace of GOD (ver. 13.) And while the&s;e continue, not a &s;erious Thought of GOD can &s;ind a Place in their Minds. And even when Afflictions come upon them (ver. 14.) &s;till they will make hard Shifts, before they will let the Grace of GOD, concurring with his Providence, per&s;uade them to think of a Return (ver. 15, 16)</P>
<P>When they &s;ee them&s;elves naked, indigent, and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">one, then they recover the Exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on (ver. 17.) Then they remem|ber the Ble&s;&s;ings they have thrown away, and attend to the Mi&s;ery they have incurred. And hereupon they re&s;olve to return to their Father, and put the Re&s;olution immediately in Practice (ver. 18, 19.)</P>
<P>Behold with Wonder and Plea&s;ure, the gracious Reception <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ind, from divine, injured Goodne&s;s! When &s;uch a Prodigal comes to his Father, He &s;ees him afar off (ver. 20.) He pities, meets, embraces him, and interrupts his Acknowledgments, with the To|kens of his returning Favour (ver. 21.) He arrays him with the Robe of a Redeemer's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, with inward and outward Ho|line&s;s, adorns him with all his &s;anctifying Graces, and honours him with the Tokens of adopting Love (ver. 22.) And all this he does with unutterable Delight, in that he who was lo&s;t is now found (ver. 23, 24.)</P>
<P>Let no elder Brother murmur at this Indulgence, but rather wel|come the Prodigal back into the Family. And let tho&s;e who have been thus received, wander no more, but emulate the &s;tricte&s;t Piety of tho&s;e who for many Years have &s;erved their heavenly Father, and not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his Commandments.</P>

<P>After the&s;e things Je&s;us manife&s;ted him&s;elf again to the di&s;ciples at the &s;ea of Tiberias; he 
manife&s;ted <HI>him&s;elf</HI> thus. <MILESTONE N="2"> There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Na|thanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <HI>&s;ons</HI> of Ze|bedee, 
and two other of his di&s;ciples. <MILESTONE N="3"> Simon Peter &s;aith to them, I go a fi&s;hing. They &s;ay to him, We al&s;o go with thee. They went out and entered into the ve&s;&s;el, but caught nothing that 
night. <MILESTONE N="4"> When the morning was come, Je&s;us &s;tood on the &s;hore; but the di&s;ciples knew not that it 
was Je&s;us. <MILESTONE N="5"> Then Je&s;us faith to them, Children, have ye any meat? They an&s;wered him, No. 
And he &s;aid to them, Ca&s;t your net on the right &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and ye &s;hall find. <MILESTONE N="6"> They ca&s;t therefore, and now they were not able to draw it, 
for the multitude of fi&s;hes. <MILESTONE N="7"> Then the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved &s;aith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter hearing that it was the Lord, girt on his up|per coat (for he was &s;tript) and threw him&s;elf into 
the &s;ea. <MILESTONE N="8"> And the other di&s;ciples came in the ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="414" REF="023976_0413_0FC2C85C56246948">(for they were not far from land, about two hun|dred 
cubits) drawing the net <HI>full</HI> of fi&s;hes. <MILESTONE N="9"> When they came to land they &s;ee a fire of coals there, and 
fi&s;h laid thereon, and bread. <MILESTONE N="10"> Je&s;us &s;aith to them, 
Bring of the fi&s;hes which ye have taken now. <MILESTONE N="11"> Si|mon Peter went on board, and drew the net to land, full of great fi&s;hes, an hundred and fifty and three; and tho' there were &s;o many, the net was 
not broken. <MILESTONE N="12"> Je&s;us &s;aith to them, Come ye <HI>and</HI> dine. And none of the di&s;ciples pre&s;umed to a&s;k him, Who art thou? Knowing that it was the 
Lord. <MILESTONE N="13"> Je&s;us then cometh and taketh bread, and 
giveth to them, and fi&s;h likewi&s;e. <MILESTONE N="14"> This was the third time that Je&s;us &s;hewed him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples, after he was ri&s;en from the dead.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"> When they had dined, Je&s;us &s;aith to Simon Peter, Simon, <HI>&s;on</HI> of Jonah, love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e <HI>do?</HI> He &s;aith to him, Yea, Lord, thou know|e&s;t that I love thee. He &s;aith to him, Feed my 
lambs. <MILESTONE N="16"> He &s;aith to him again, the &s;econd time, Simon, <HI>&s;on</HI> of Jonah, love&s;t thou me? He &s;aith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee. 
He &s;aith to him, Feed my &s;heep. <MILESTONE N="17"> He &s;aith to him the third time, Simon, <HI>&s;on</HI> of Jonah, love&s;t thou me? Peter was grieved, becau&s;e he &s;aid to him the third time, Love&s;t thou me? And he &s;aid to him, Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things; thou knowe&s;t that I love thee. Je&s;us &s;aith to him, Feed my &s;heep:
<PB N="415" REF="023976_0414_0FC2C8696C93E168">
<MILESTONE N="18"> Verily, verily I &s;ay unto thee, when thou wa&s;t young, thou did&s;t gird thy&s;elf, and walk whither thou woulde&s;t: but when thou &s;halt be old, thou &s;halt &s;tretch out thy hands, and another &s;hall gird thee, and carry <HI>thee</HI> whither thou woulde&s;t not. 
This he &s;aid, &s;ignifying by what death he &s;hould glorify God. <MILESTONE N="19"> And having &s;aid this, he &s;aith to 
him, Follow me. <MILESTONE N="20"> Peter turning about, &s;eeth the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved following, who al&s;o leaned on his brea&s;t at &s;upper, and &s;aid, Lord, 
who is he that betrayeth thee? <MILESTONE N="21"> Peter &s;eeing him, &s;aith to Je&s;us, Lord, and what <HI>&s;hall</HI> this man <HI>do?</HI> 
<MILESTONE N="22"> Je&s;us &s;aith to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, 
what <HI>is it</HI> to thee? <MILESTONE N="23"> Follow thou me. Then went this &s;aying abroad among the brethren, that that di&s;ciple &s;hould not die. Yet Je&s;us did not &s;ay to him, That he &s;hould not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <HI>is it</HI> to thee?</P>
<PB N="416" REF="023976_0415_0FC2C86B567757C0">
<P><MILESTONE N="24"> This is the di&s;ciple who te&s;tifieth of the&s;e things, and wrote the&s;e things: and we know that his te&s;ti|mony 
is true. <MILESTONE N="25"> And there are al&s;o many other things which Je&s;us did, which, if they were to be written particularly, I &s;uppo&s;e that even the world it&s;elf would not contain the books that were written.</P>
