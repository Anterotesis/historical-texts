<Q><BIBL><HI>I</HI> Corinthians XV. <HI>58.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;Always Abounding in the Work of the LORD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BY Peru&s;ing this Chapter, you may, Find, The Holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is There|in, Propounding and Confirming that. Great Article of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, The Doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;urrec|tion From the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Among the <HI>Coronthians</HI> were &s;ome People, that had &s;o Indulged them&s;elves in their Abominable
<PB N="4" REF="004487_0003_100D56C1B8DE8C48">Sen&s;ualities, that they had exceedingly Extingui&s;h|ed all Profitable Apprehen&s;ions, about <HI>un&s;een E|ternal Things.</HI> They had wonderfully Stupified their Con&s;ciences, by Gratifying their Sen&s;ual Ap|petites; and were become in a manner meer <HI>Sen|&s;itive Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>THEY had &s;unk almo&s;t below the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on: So that they laid a&s;ide all &s;uitable Noti|ons, about <HI>Natural Religion:</HI> Therefore, No won|der, if they Suppre&s;&s;ed all Thoughts about <HI>Revealed Religion.</HI> They would &s;ay, <HI>Let us Eat and Drink, for tomorrow we &s;hall Die.</HI> As if they had &s;aid, <HI>This Life is the only time, for us, to take our Plea&s;ure in. After this Life, there will be nothing for us, to Enjoy. And we know not how &s;oon this Life will end, therefore let us take as much Plea&s;ure, as we can, while we Live.</HI></P>
<P>THENCE, It is no wonder, if there were abun|dance of Di&s;orders among them: And abundance of Pernicious Practices with Erroneous Opini|ens.</P>
<P>AMONG other things, the Doctrine of the <HI>Re|&s;urrection from the Dead</HI> was not only Doubted or Scrupled, but was Denied and Renounced by &s;ome of them: Some &s;aid, <HI>There is no Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE the Apo&s;tle &s;pends the greate&s;t part of a long Chapter, to prove the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead:</HI> And one of his chief Arguments to prove it, is, <HI>The Re&s;urrection of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And of this he could Produce the cleare&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="004487_0003_100D56C1B8DE8C48">and fulle&s;t &amp; mo&s;t inconte&s;tible Evidences. For He was &s;een not only by one or two, but by all the eleven Apo&s;tles, and by five hundred People at once, &amp; a great part of them were Living then, to Declare what they had &s;een. Yea, He him&s;elf could &s;ay, that he had &s;een the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; And therefore it was Undeniable that <HI>He was Ri&s;en from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>BUT ina&s;much as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was Ri&s;en from the Dead, and had &s;ent His Mini&s;ters to Preach, that He was Ri&s;en from the Dead, and that People &s;hould Believe in Him for Eternal Salvation, and for Deliverance from the power of the Grave, it was therefore unrea&s;onable, to Que&s;|tion, whether there would be a <HI>Re&s;urrection from the Dead:</HI> unle&s;s all their Preaching were Vain.</P>
<P>BUT having Proved, that there would be a Re&s;urrection from the Dead, and a Day of Judg|ment, wherein there would be a Reward given to all according to their Works, He Improves, in our Text, what he had Proved.</P>
<P><HI>THEREFORE,</HI> That is, for as much as, there will be as Re&s;urrection of the Dead; and Con&s;e|quently, a time of Retribution for all the Godly; They &s;hall be Graciou&s;ly and Gloriou&s;ly Recom|penced;</P>
<P><HI>BE Stedfa&s;t;</HI> That is, be fully &s;ettled in the Belief of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and parti|cularly, in the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection, which is a Principal Article of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004487_0004_100D56C3D10BD0B8">
<HI>BE immoveable,</HI> That is, be firmly fixed again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition, from any of the Cavils and A&s;&s;aults, that may be endeavoured by Wicked Sinners, to &s;hake your Faith, in this great Doctrine of Religion.</P>
<P>THEN it Follows,</P>
<P><HI>BE always Abounding in the Work of the Lord,</HI> That is, con&s;tantly &s;trive to do &amp; to grow better &amp; better. And be more and more Diligent about the Work Pre&s;cribed and Accepted by the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>FOR as much as ye know that your labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI> That is, the Lord will Cer|tainly, Graciou&s;ly and Gloriou&s;ly Reward all your Sincere endeavours, about His Work, at the Great and the La&s;t Day. For &s;o far will the Saints of God be, from finding that they have Laboured in Vain, while they have been about the Work of God, that they that have Laboured Abundantly &s;hall be Rewarded Abundantly. The Recom|pences of their Endeavours will be Wonderful as well as Eternal. The Lord will take Effectual Care that they &s;hall not lo&s;e their Labour.</P>
<P>WE need only further con&s;ider, that the things in this Epi&s;tle are Directed unto all Chri&s;tians; For &s;o is the Epi&s;tle Directed in Chap. 1. Ver. 2. &mdash;<HI>To all that in every Place, call upon the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>AND then the Doctrine to be Con&s;idered by us all, mu&s;t be this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="7" REF="004487_0004_100D56C3D10BD0B8">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> IT is the Duty of all Chri&s;tians always to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</HEAD>
<P>NO doubt, but all of us would be Accounted Chri&s;tians. God knows what all of us are.</P>
<P>THIS Doctrine tells what is our Duty, if we be Real Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine mu&s;t be Explained, that our Du|ty may be under&s;tood. Our Duty mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood, that it may be Practi&s;ed, there is no re|gular Practice without &s;uitable Knowledge. There|fore we mu&s;t know our Duty that we may do it well. To help us, to know our Duty, the Explanati|on of the Doctrine may in the Fear of God, by the Help of Chri&s;t, be Endeavoured under &s;everal Pro|po&s;itions. Hear then that your Souls may Live.</P>
<P>PROP. I. THERE <HI>is a Work of the Lord In|cumbent on all Chri&s;tians.</HI> All Chri&s;tians have a Work belonging to them, that may be Stiled, <HI>The Work of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>NO Chri&s;tian may Live without &s;ome Work. It is a great Wickedne&s;s for any per&s;on to Live in Idlene&s;s. For <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> are altogether Incon&s;i&s;tent. It you &s;ay, <HI>An Idle Chri&s;tian,</HI> you ut|ter a Contradiction. Idle Per&s;ons are no Chri&s;ti|ans. Whatever they think, about them&s;elves, and
<PB N="8" REF="004487_0005_100D56C75BA8E308">whatever others may think about them, God will not own them for Chri&s;tians, if they don't Repent of their Idlene&s;s, and beg Pardon of God. for that, as well as for all their other Wickedne&s;s, for the Sake of Chri&s;t, who always Plea&s;ed God, went about doing Good and was never idle.</P>
<P>IF Per&s;ons are Born to great E&s;tates and &s;pend their Time, in Idlene&s;s and wa&s;t away their E&s;|tates, they will have a dreadful Account to give: They will not be found among Chri&s;tians at the La&s;t Day, unle&s;s they Repent.</P>
<P>IF Per&s;ons Live upon the Labours of others, and &s;pend their Time in Idlene&s;s, without any Im|ployment, for the Benefit of others, they cannot be numbred among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>YEA, If Per&s;ons Labour, to get great E&s;tates, with this de&s;ign, chiefly, that they and theirs may live in Idlene&s;s: They cannot be Acknowledged for Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>BE &s;ure then, they that u&s;e Ungodly Methods, to get Riches, that they might Live in Idlene&s;s mu&s;t for ever be Excluded from the Number of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THEIR Con&s;ciences, if Enlightned, mu&s;t fly in their Faces, while they Pretend to Chri&s;tianity, but De&s;ire to Live in Idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>FOR all Chri&s;tians have &s;ome Work Incumbent on them. And this work may be ju&s;tly called, <HI>The Work of the Lord,</HI> Becau&s;e it is Required by the Lord, and it will be Rewarded by the Lord. But &s;hould it be Inquited,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004487_0005_100D56C75BA8E308">
Que&s;t. <HI>WHAT is Implied in the Work of the Lord which is Incumbent on all Chri&s;tians?</HI></P>
<P>HEREUNTO it might be An&s;wered, in General.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> THE Work of the Lord Injoined on all Chri&s;tians, comprehends all the Duties of Chri&s;|tianity; All the Exerci&s;es of a Chri&s;tian Conver|&s;ation, or a Conver&s;ation according to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL Duties of Piety, and Religion toward God, All Duties of Charity and Righteou&s;ne&s;s toward Man, all Duties of our General Calling, or &s;uch as are Common to all Chri&s;tians, belonging to them as Chri&s;tians, all Duties of our Per&s;onal Cal|ling, or &s;uch as are Special to Chri&s;tians, in their &s;everal Orders and Stations in the World; the&s;e belong to the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>THEY are Sum'd up, in the Old Te&s;tament, in Micah 6.8. <HI>The Lord hath &s;hewed thee, O Man, what is good, what doth the Lord Require of thee, but to do Ju&s;tly, to love Mercy and to walk Humbly with thy God?</HI></P>
<P>THEY are Sum'd up, in the New Te&s;tament, in 2 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound words in Faith and Love, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>BRIEFLY, The Great work of all Chri&s;tians, it is, To maintain &s;uch a Union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith, as to receive con&s;tant Supplies of
<PB N="10" REF="004487_0006_100D56C8F4B01D08">Grace from Him, continualy to bear a Te&s;timony for the Truths &amp; Ways of God, before the World, for the Glory of God, in this World, and to make Preparation for Glory with God in the Heavenly World, for ever.</P>
<P>THIS is the Work of the Lord; a Work Pro|pounded by the Lord, a Work Well plea&s;ing to the Lord.</P>
<P>BUT more Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">[I.] <HI>BELIEVING on Chri&s;t,</HI> With a firm Faith, for Eternal Salvation, Living by Faith on the Son of God, is the Work of the Lord. So are we told, in John 6.29. <HI>This is the Work of God, that you Believe on Him whom He hath &s;ent.</HI> That is, on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only Saviour of Sinners. (1 John 3.23.)</P>
<P>THEREFORE mu&s;t we be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of our Sinfulne&s;s and Mi&s;ery, as to be made willing, to Repair to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Salvation of our Souls Commiting and Re&s;igning our &s;elves to Him, as the Author of Eternal Salvation to all, that Obey Him; And Applying our &s;elves to Him, as our Prophet, for In&s;truction, as our Prie&s;t, for Attonement, as our King, for Government; Rely|ing on His Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for Ju&s;tification, Com|plying with His Spirit for Sanctification; Tru&s;ting in Him, to work, in us, all that is Well plea&s;ing in His Sight; Waiting on Him, to fit us for, &amp; bring
<PB N="11" REF="004487_0006_100D56C8F4B01D08">us to Eternal Glory, by His Rich and Free Grace, and His Sovereign Almighty Power.</P>
<P>SO to Believe in the Eternal Redeemer, is the Work of God. And if we do nothing about this Work, our Souls mu&s;t be, for ever Undone. We mu&s;t lie down in Eternal Sorrow, if we Neglect this Work of Faith. We &s;hall do nothing well, about any other Work, until we begin to Believe in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT if we attend this Work of God, to Believe on the Name of His Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all our Hearts, then &s;hall we be Prepared, for other things, belonging to the Work of God.</P>
<P>THEREFORE mu&s;t we be per&s;waded, to Ac|cept of that Invitation of our Lord, in Mat. 11.28. Where He &s;ays, <HI>Come to me all ye, that Labour and are Heavy Laden, and I will give you Re&s;t.</HI> Re&s;t not without coming to Chri&s;t, but come to Chri&s;t, and He will give Re&s;t. Re&s;t from Sin, Re&s;t, from Grief, and Re&s;t from Fear: But not Re&s;t from Work. There will be more Work &s;till. For &s;ays our Lord, <HI>Take</HI>] <HI>my Yoke upon you, Learn of me.</HI> So, True Believers on Chri&s;t have Work, to do, after they have Believed. They are, to draw in the Yoke of Chri&s;t, and therein, to attend the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>INDEED, at Death will the Saints of God Re&s;t from their Labours, according to what we Read in, Rev. 14.13. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead, who Die in the Lord, they Re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works follow
<PB N="12" REF="004487_0007_100D56CAA859C5E0">them.</HI> Yet they do not Re&s;t from the Work of Prai&s;ing the Lord. For we Read in Rev. 4.8. With Reference to the Saints, in the Church Trium|phant, as well as, in the Church Militant, <HI>They Re&s;t, not Night nor Day, from &s;aying, Holy, Holy. Holy Lord God Almighty, which was and is, and is to come.</HI> The Saints of God, in Heaven will be Prai&s;ing the Lord, their Creator &amp; Redeemer &amp; Sanctifier, for ever. But, be &s;ure, in this World, they mu&s;t not cea&s;e from Work, as long as they Live in this World. Tho' they have Believed, their Believ|ing in Chri&s;t will not Relea&s;e them from other Parts of the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>AND, to mention &s;ome other parts of that Work, we may now go on, to Affirm,</P>
<P N="2">[II.] <HI>REPENTING of Sin,</HI> With Unfeigned Repentance and Maintaining the Life of &s;uch Re|pentance belongs to the Work of the Lord. So are we told in Act. 17.30. <HI>God Commandeth all men every where, to Repent.</HI> Repentance of Sin is Com|manded to God, and may be reckoned part of the Work of the Lord, the Work, which the Lord hath Obliged His People to attend, while they Live in this World. They mu&s;t be &s;o Convinced of their Sinfulne&s;s by Nature and Practice, their Sinfulne&s;s of Soul and Life, their Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion and Commi&s;&s;ion, their Sins again&s;t the Law, and
<PB N="13" REF="004487_0007_100D56CAA859C5E0">again&s;t the Go&s;pel, as to be Humbled before the Lord for all their Deviations from, and Violations of the Rules, that He hath &s;et before them, and Confe&s;s and Bewail them all, with Grief &amp; Shame, and Beg Pardon for them all, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, with Sincere De&s;ires, and Serious Purpo&s;es, and Earne&s;t Endeavours, to Turn from all Sin, to God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to Live more and more Exactly according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, eve|ry Day.</P>
<P>SUCH a Repentance belongs to the work of the Lord. Therefore mu&s;t we be Per&s;waded to Com|ply with that Propo&s;al in Prov. 28.13. <HI>He that Confe&s;&s;eth and For&s;aketh His &s;in, &s;hall have mercy.</HI> There will be the mercy of Pardon of Sin, the mercy of Power over &amp; again&s;t Sin, the mercy of Peace and Reconciliation with God, the mercy of Quietne&s;s and Ea&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;cience, to them that Heartily Confe&s;s and For&s;ake their Sins, with Sorrow for Sin, with Hatred to Sin, with Re&s;olu|tion, by the Grace of God, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to live more according to the Doctrines of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>AND this work of Repentance mu&s;t be continued all our Days, we mu&s;t Never leave off the work of Repentance, while we live in this world. They that Pretend they have Repented enough, Declare, they have not Repented at all. They &s;hew a certain Token that they know not what belongs to Repen|tance. They have not &s;o much as begun to Repent, if they think they may leave off to Repent, If they
<PB N="14" REF="004487_0008_100D56CD06BC0790">think, they are &s;o Perfect and Righteous, that they need no Repentance, it is very &s;ure, that they have lived impenitently ever &s;ince they lived. And how|ever they mock &amp; &s;coff at <HI>maintaining of our Chri&s;ti|an Warfare, During Life.</HI> It is very &s;ure they mu&s;t lo&s;e their Souls forever unle&s;s they change their minds about their State, &amp; &s;ee their Need of Re|pentance, &amp; begin the Work of Unfeigned Repen|tance. They mu&s;t Repent &amp; Turn from all their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &amp; from their Fal&s;e &amp; Vain Opinions, or their Iniquities will be their Ruin.</P>
<P>YEA, Chri&s;tians mu&s;t not only Repent every Day, for their Daily Sins, but they mu&s;t al&s;o &s;trive, to be more Sorry, for their former Sins. For many times God may Cha&s;tize and Afflict His Children, after their Believing in Chri&s;t, for their former Sins, that they committed before their Conver&s;ion, as well as, for their falls into Sin, after their Conver&s;ion becau&s;e they have not been &s;o &s;orry, as they &s;hould have been for their former Sins. He may let them fall &s;o, as, to open their former Wounds, to make them Bleed afre&s;h, that they may Repent, with a more bitter Sorrow, for their former Sins.</P>
<P>BUT they that have &s;pent or lo&s;t, the mo&s;t of their Time in their Unregenracy, &amp; have not begun the work of Repentance, until their Old Age, mu&s;t be very Diligent, about this Work of the Lord; To call their Sins to Remembrance; To Confe&s;s &amp; Be|wail them; To Lament their Condition, before the Lord, &s;o as to be Quickned, yet more Fervently to
<PB N="15" REF="004487_0008_100D56CD06BC0790">Beg for the &s;en&s;e of the Pardon of them. They &s;hould be more concerned, about &s;uch things, than mo&s;t People are Accu&s;tomed to be, or things will Appear to be very &s;ad with their Souls.</P>
<P>AND, be &s;ure, the work of Repentance mu&s;t be Continued by Repenting Sinners, until they are Perfectly Delivered from Sin, upon the Separati|on of their Spirits from their Bodies, by Death. Repentance mu&s;t Live, until we Die. And we mu&s;t Attend the Work of Repentance, all the time, that we Live, in this World of Sin. We mu&s;t Live Repenting; yea, we mu&s;t Die Repent|ing; And looking to the Mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for Life Eternal.</P>
<P>AND if this Work of the Lord he well Attend|ed, then we &s;hall Attend another Exerci&s;e, in that Work.</P>
<P N="3">[III.] FOLLOWING and Perfecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of God, all the Day long, and all their Life long, belongs to the Work of the Lord, that is Incumbent on all Chri&s;tians. For &s;o are we Ad|vi&s;ed, in 2 Cor. 7. 1. <HI>Let us clean&s;e or &s;elves from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and of Spirit, Perfecting Holi|ne&s;s, in the Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hould be daily con&s;idering what our Sinful Defilements are, and upon the &s;ight of any Sinful Pollution, Appearing on our Souls, Immediately Repair unto the Fountain opened for Sin and for
<PB N="16" REF="004487_0009_100D56CFC1528428">Uncleane&s;s. We mu&s;t Apply our &s;elves unto the Purifying Blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that our Souls may be more and more Purified from all our Sinful Impurities. And we &s;hould not be willing to Sleep, as long as we Apprehend our Souls un|der any &s;pot or &s;tain of Sin, for the Removal of which, we have not Expre&s;ly Addre&s;&s;ed our &s;elves unto the Pardoning, Purging Blood of Je-Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WE are to Pray for Purity, in Heart, in Lip, and in Life, and Labour for Holine&s;s, in all manner of Conver&s;ation; Striving to be Holy, as He that hath called us, is Holy, And Improve all Merciful things with which God is Favouring us, and all Sorrowful things, with which God is Cha&s;tening us that we may thereby be made more Partakers of an Holine&s;s Re&s;embling the Holine&s;s of the In|finitely Holy God.</P>
<P>AND whereas we may all find Abundance want|ing, as to Perfection of Holine&s;s, we may find Abun|dance to be done by us all in following of Holine&s;s, we mu&s;t take abundance of Pains, to be more Ho|ly. And therefore mu&s;t we &s;trive, to have our Faith every Day Exerci&s;ed on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Deriving of Grace from Him, our Faith mu&s;t go forth unto Him, to fetch in con|&s;tant Supplies of New Grace, from that Foun|tain of all Grace; to be Advancing in Holine&s;s: That our Hearts being Purified by Faith, our ways may be daily growing more and more Pure, &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="004487_0009_100D56CFC1528428">that we may be continually making our &s;elves more and more meet, to be partakers of the Inheri|tance of the Saints in light, and fitting for the Ble&s;&s;ed-making Vi&s;ion of the Lord.</P>
<P>WE know, from Heb. 12.14. <HI>Without Holine&s;s, none &s;hall &s;ee the Lord;</HI> And from Mat. 5.8. <HI>The Pure in Heart &s;hall be Ble&s;&s;ed with &s;eeing of God.</HI> Therefore Endeavours, to Attain Perfection of Ho|line&s;s, belong to the Work of the Lord, Incum|bent on all Chri&s;tians.</P>

<P N="4">[IV.] PREPARING for, and Improving of, all the Holy Ordinances of God, for their Growth in Grace, and their Advancement in Holine&s;s, be|longs to the Work of the Lord, Incumbent on all Chri&s;tians. For we Read about certain Per&s;ons, that were attending the Work of the Lord, in Luk. 1.6. <HI>They were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blamele&s;s.</HI> When it is &s;aid, <HI>They were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments of the Lord.</HI> It implies, that if, they had not Regarded all the Commandments &amp; Ordinances of the Lord, they could not have been Accounted <HI>Righteous be|fore God,</HI> nor Blamele&s;s: Therefore if Chri&s;tians will Attend all the Work of the Lord Incumbent on them, they mu&s;t have a Regard unto all the Ordi|nances
<PB N="18" REF="004487_0010_100D56D2284952F0">of God, all the In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, in His Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Kingdorn in this World.</P>
<P>AND among the Ordinances, to be Regarded by Chri&s;tians, that would Attend all the Work of the Lord, there is, not only Praying to God, in Se|cret, in Private and in Publick; on Ordinary and Extraordinary occa&s;ions: All Chri&s;tians mu&s;t at|tend the&s;e Kinds of Prayer, in their Sea&s;ons, if they will attend all the Work of the Lord, or indeed any Part of that Work, well; Not only Reading and Hearing the World of God; Chri&s;tians, Be &s;ure, mu&s;t attend this, or they will Neglect &s;ome part of the Work of the Lord and are in the way, to Neglect all the Re&s;t, that they &s;hould attend; If they will not Heart what the Lord &s;ays unto them, in the Publick Di&s;pen&s;ation of his Word, by the Mini&s;try of His Amba&s;&s;adors, it is no wonder that other things be Neglected: But there be al&s;o the &s;peci|al Sealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace, Bapti&s;m and the Supper of the Lord, that are to be Attended and Improved.</P>
<P>ALL Chri&s;tians, that are Able, Truly to &s;ay, that they De&s;ire and Labour, to Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for Eternal Salvation, &s;hould &s;eek for Bapti&s;m, for Them&s;elves, and their Chil|dren, if they have not been Baptized. But if any Profe&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;tianity, are not willing to Repent of their Sins, Confe&s;&s;ing them, and Profe&s;&s;ing a wil|lingne&s;s to For&s;ake them, and look to Chri&s;t, for the Pardon of them, that they may be Baptized, it
<PB N="19" REF="004487_0010_100D56D2284952F0">is very &s;ure, that they Neglect &s;ome part of the Work of the Lord, that they &s;hould Attend. For the Lord has commanded His Mini&s;ters, in Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go, Teach all Nations, Baptizing them, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho|ly Spirit, Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things, what&s;o|ever I have Commanded you.</HI></P>
<P>THEN they that would be Acknowledged for the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, are to fit, and &s;eek for Bap|ti&s;m; Nor may they expect to Enjoy it, until they do, by &s;ome way or other di&s;cover a willingne&s;s, to be the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, if they are Up grown. For that Ordinance of God is called the Bapti&s;m of Repentance; and therefore no Apparently Im|penitent Sinner may be Baptized. <HI>John</HI> the Bap|ti&s;t would Baptize none, that Appeared unwil|ling, to manife&s;t Repentance. Per&s;ons, that have not been Baptized, &s;hould Repent of their Sins, and manife&s;t, by all proper ways, that they have truly Repented, that they may be Baptized. And being Baptized, they &s;hould Labour, to Improve their Bapti&s;m, to Promote their Holine&s;s, if they would attend all the Work of the Lord. Un|to a Repenting Sinner, it may be Advi&s;ed as, in Act. 22.16. <HI>Ari&s;e, and be Baptized, and wa&s;h a|way thy Sins, calling on the Name of the Lord.</HI> O|therwi&s;e, there would &s;ome of the Work of the Lord be Neglected.</P>
<P>AND then, tho&s;e up grown Chri&s;tians, that are capable of Examining them&s;elves, concerning their
<PB N="20" REF="004487_0011_100D56D46D795798">Knowledge, to Di&s;cern the Lords Body; and con|cerning their Faith, to Feed upon Him; and con|cerning their Love to God and Chri&s;t, and the Saints, becau&s;e of their Holine&s;s; and to all their Neighbours to De&s;ire their Benefit; and concern|ing their Unfeigned Repentance; and their De|&s;ires &amp; Labours about their New Obedience; They &s;hould Repair to the Table of the Lord; And they &s;hould Improve the Supper of the Lord, to Excite and A&s;&s;i&s;t their Holy, Humble, Thankful, Delightful, Believing and Penitent Remembrance of their Lord, and of His Love to their Souls, that they may Grow in their Grace, Joy, Comfort and Preparation for the Injoyment of their Lord, in His Heavenly Glories. This they mu&s;t do, if they would attend all the Work of the Lord. For &s;o is it expre&s;ly Commanded, in 1 Cor. 11.28. <HI>Let a man Examine him&s;elf, &amp; Eat of that Bread, &amp; Drink of that Cup.</HI> And about Eating and Drinking the Sacramental Bread and Wine, our Lord &s;ays to His Di&s;ciples, <HI>This do, in Remembrance of me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT Chri&s;tians may not content them&s;elves in the Injoyment of the&s;e Ordinances of God, but they mu&s;t be careful, to Improve them, for the ends, for which God hath Appointed them; to Promote their Faith, Repentance, Holine&s;s and Meetne&s;s for Heaven. For it is not the Injoy|ment, but the Improvement of Privileges, that will do Good.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004487_0011_100D56D46D795798">
NOR may Per&s;ons pretend, that they would Improve the Ordinances of God, if they might Injoy them, while they are not Prepared for them. If they are unfit for the Holy Ordinances of God, they cannot &s;afely Attend them. It would be a Dangerous thing for Per&s;ons to Attend the Sealing Ordinances of God, while they Know them|&s;elves, to be in the gall of Bitterne&s;s and in the bond of Wickedne&s;s; or under the Power of any Reigning Sin.</P>
<P>FOR if Per&s;ons are Baptized, while they know them&s;elves to be Re&s;olved Sinners, it is no won|der, if their Bapti&s;m Seal them up under their Impiety, forever: No wonder, if, like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> they are given over to Ungodline&s;s, and are more Ungodly after their Bapti&s;m than ever they were before.</P>
<P>AND then, be &s;ure, if Per&s;ons Venture unto the Table of the Lord, while they Know them&s;elves to be Re&s;olved Sinners, It is no wonder, if they are, by that Ordinance, Confirmed in their Ini|quity. No wonder, if Satan do Enter into them, as into <HI>Judas,</HI> after he had Received the Sop, that might be offered to him, after the Admini|&s;tration of the Pa&s;&s;over. Wonder not, if &s;uch Woful Sinners become &s;uch Hardened Sinners, that they cannot Repent, They will not Repent; They will never be Renewed again to Repentance.</P>
<P>THE Mini&s;ters of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may not Admini&s;ter the&s;e Holy Ordinances to any
<PB N="22" REF="004487_0012_100D56D693D3C288">that appear to be Wicked Sinners and continue Impenitent in their Wickedne&s;s; This would be a Prophanation of tho&s;e Holy Ordinances. But they mu&s;t not be Prophanely Pro&s;tituted unto the Ungodly Lu&s;ts of wicked Sinners. This would be highly Di&s;plea&s;ing to the Holy Lord.</P>
<P>THESE things are not mentioned for the Di&s;|couragement of any Serious Pious Per&s;ons, that may be Weak in Grace and may be under Doubts and Fears: For &s;uch will de&s;ire to attend the Work of the Lord with &s;uitable Preparation: They will endeavour that their Hopes may over|come their Fears. And are willing to give a rea|&s;on of their Hope, that they are Prepared for the&s;e Holy Ordinances.</P>
<P>AND if Per&s;ons Hope, they are Prepared for the Sealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace, they &s;hould beware le&s;t they become chargeable with that Crime charged on &s;ome, in Mal. 3.7. <HI>Ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> For if they are Guilty of &s;uch a Crime, they mu&s;t Repent of it, with bitter Humiliation, before the Lord, and before the World, if they would attend all the work of the Lord. For Preparing our &s;elves to Improve all the Ordinances of the Hou&s;e of the Lord, belongs to the Work of the Lord which Chri&s;tians mu&s;t not willingly Neglect, if they would keep clear from Rebellion again&s;t the Lord, who hath Commanded that Work for all Chri&s;tians.</P>

<P>IT is plain, that they do not Walk Hone&s;tly, that have no Bu&s;ine&s;s of their own to mind. Then they do not mind the Work of the Lord.

<P>HIS De&s;ire is Declared in John 17.24. <HI>Father, I will that they, whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory, which thou ha&s;t given me, for thou ha&s;t Loved me before the Foun|dation of the World.</HI> (And in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.)</P>
<P>HE is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that Obey Him. He hath provided Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for them, He hath bought them out of the Hands of Divine Ju&s;tice, with His own mo&s;t Precious Blood, and brought them out of the Kingdom of Satan, from under his Bondage, by His own Almighty Power, that they might be His willing Servants, To be improved for His Glory. And He hath Bought Heaven for their Eternal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He had a Right unto Heaven, as He was the Eternal Son of God. But by His Obedi|ence to God, His Father, He Purcha&s;ed a Right
<PB N="34" REF="004487_0018_100D56E41955FE10">unto Heaven, for all the Children of God. And He makes over this Right unto them, that they may have it for their Everla&s;ting Inheritance. Having Spent His Life, He &s;hed His Blood for them, He Died for them, and Ro&s;e again from the Dead for them, and A&s;cended up into Heaven, to Take &amp; Keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heaven for them, until He brings them into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD the HOLY SPIRIT hath brought home the Benefits of Redemption, to all that are indeed Chri&s;tians, who begin to Injoy the Sal|vation, that is Purpo&s;ed, by God the Father for them and Purcha&s;ed for them, by God their Saviour.</P>
<P>THE Eternal Spirit of God Awakens them, Inlightens them, Convinces them; and makes them Concerned, about their Eternal Affairs.

<P>HOWEVER, this we may &s;ay; none of their Labours in the Work of the Lord will be in Vain, they will be Abundantly Recompenced, with a far more exceeding and Eternal Weight of Glory.</P>

<P>THE Apo&s;tle con&s;idering this, would Labour more Abundantly than others, and would have Chri&s;tians to con&s;ider, what God hath done, in Shedding the Holy Spirit Abundantly on them

<P>THE. Days Foretold in the Book of <HI>Daniel,</HI> &s;eem to be coming Apace, when, <HI>The Wicked will do Wickedly.</HI> There is no Help for it. There is no Hindering of it.</P>
<P>YOUNG People Re&s;olve to keep their Cour&s;e, in the Ways of Ungodline&s;s, though-the Word of God and His Judgments le&s;&s;er and greater warn them, and they &s;ee their Companions going into Eternity, leaving them under Awful Appre|hen&s;ions about them; And though Parents warn them, they will not hearken to their Coun&s;els.

<P>BUT the more Sinners do again&s;t God, the more &s;hould Chri&s;tians do for God.

PROP. III. IT is the Duty of all Chri&s;ti|ans to Abound <HI>Always</HI> in the Work of the Lord. Not only while they are Young, but al&s;o when they are Old: And therefore they &s;hould begin betimes to do Abundance of Good, and continue to bring forth Fruit, in Old Age.

<P>Que&s;t. <HI>BY what Methods are we to be A&s;&s;isted in Abounding Always in the Work of the Lord?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. I</HI> LAY a good Foundation, for well doing, by getting a Good Principle in your Souls. Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. GET a good Knowledge of the Truths of God, in your Souls. It is not good, that the Soul be without Knowledge. This might <HI>Solomon</HI> Learn of his Father <HI>David,</HI> who Charged him, in 1. Chron. 28.9. <HI>To know the God of His Father, and &s;erve Him, with a Perfect Heart and a Willing Mind.</HI> There can be no right Service of God without good Knowledge. But if we Know the Truths of God, then Happy are we if we do them. What Goodne&s;s without Know ledge? Therefore &s;hould we Labour, to Know
<PB N="44" REF="004487_0023_100D56F00899E780">the Truths of God; That there is a Glorious God; That there are Three Per&s;ons in the God head, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit: That God Made and Rules the World; That Man was Made Holy; but by Sin, Fell in to a Mi&s;erable Condition, from whence he could not, by any Strength or Worth of his own, Re|cover him&s;elf; That the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Eternal Son of God, becoming a Man, &s;o being God and Man, in two Di&s;tinct Natures, in one Per&s;on for ever; is the only Saviour of Sinners; That He is a Prophet, a Prie&s;t and a King. for their Salvation; That He is Able and Willing to Save them, that come to Him; that there is no Salvation without Faith in Chri&s;t; That this Faith is the Gift of God; That God Gives it, in An&s;wer to Prayer, to them that u&s;e the Means Appointed, to be Attended, by them, that will Enjoy the Influences of the Holy Spirit, for the Working of Faith in their Souls; That Saving Faith will be Accompanied with, and E|videnced by, Good Works; That there is an Heaven for the Godly and an Hell for the Wick|ed; That our Souls are Immortal, and there will be a Re&s;urrection of our Bodies and a Day of Judgment, wherein all mu&s;t be Ordered un|to their Eternal State; That our Life Time is the only Time of Probation, for us, to make Preparation for Eternity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="45" REF="004487_0023_100D56F00899E780">
2. FIRMLY Believe the&s;e Truths of God. <HI>He that cometh to God mu&s;t Believe that He is, and that He is a Rewarder of them that Seek Him Diligently.</HI> And &s;o mu&s;t he that Worketh the Work of the Lord. Be not Satisfied, that you &s;eem, to A&s;&s;ent to the Truths of God. But &s;ee, that you &s;o Firmly Believe them, that you can Venture your Lives and your Souls upon the Truths of God, which you Profe&s;s to Be|lieve And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. MAKE &s;ure about a real Union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Believe in Him, with a true Faith. For nothing will be well done, about the Work of the Lord, until you begin about, the Work of Faith in the Lord. He &s;ays, Joh. 15.5. <HI>Without me, you can do nothing.</HI> There will be no Abounding in the Work of the Lord, by them that are out of Chri&s;t. Therefore get into Chri&s;t: And Exerci&s;e Faith in Him, to Re|ceive Strength from Him, to do the Work of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. PENITENTLY Beg the Pardon of all Sin, for the Sake of Chri&s;t. The Guilt of Sin, like a Chain, Binds the Soul, and like a Weight, Clogs the Soul, &s;o as, to hinder it from Good. If the Soul be Overwhelmed with Guilt, how can it run the Ways of the Commandments of God? Or Abound in the Work of the Lord? There|fore Cry to God, that, for the Sake of Chri&s;t, He would Pardon all Sin, both Original and
<PB N="46" REF="004487_0024_100D56F1E464F0B8">Actual, as well of Omi&s;&s;ion, as of Commi&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the Law and again&s;t the Go&s;pel, Secret as well as Open.

<P>LAY your Foundation Deep, in Penitential Humiliation for Sin pa&s;t and for Indwelling Corruption, while you are Endeavouring, to A|bound in the Work of the Lord. You mu&s;t cea&s;e to do Evil, and Beg Pardon for doing Evil, that you may begin to learn to do well, or you will never Per&s;evere in doing well. And be &s;ure to look to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, for the Forgivene&s;s of Sin. They that think, to Satisfy for their Bad Works, by doing of Good Works, will not Abound in the Work of the Lord. You mu&s;t get Pardon for ill doing, be|fore you will do well.</P>
<P>THEREFORE Exerci&s;e Repentance and E|vidence Repentance. Let it be &s;een, that you do Repent. This indeed is part of the Work of the Lord, but &s;uch a Part, that it mu&s;t be done, or no part of that Work will be well done. The Life of a Chri&s;tian Abounding in the Work of the Lord, mu&s;t be a Life of Re|pentance.</P>
<P N="5">5. A Work of Grace mu&s;t be wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of God; or there will be
<PB N="47" REF="004487_0024_100D56F1E464F0B8">no Abounding in the Work of the Lord. For in, Eph. 2.10. We are told, that <HI>We are His Workmar&s;hip Created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto good Works, which God hath before Ordained, that we &s;hould Walk in them.</HI> Until a good Work of Grace be wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of God, there will be no good Work done by the Soul. God mu&s;t &s;ay to the Soul Live; or it will not Work any good Work; and then be &s;ure it will nor Abound in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>THEREFORE mu&s;t there be Prayer to God, for the Regenerating influences of the Spirit of God, before we &s;hall begin, to do Well. People may not Indulge them&s;elves, in Sloth and &s;ay we mu&s;t wait, until God will plea&s;e to Change our Hearts, and make us willing to do well: But they mu&s;t Pray, to God, to work, in them, to will and to do that they may do well.</P>
<P>REGENERATION, by which the Soul pa&s;&s;eth out of a &s;tate of Spiritual Death, into a &s;tate of Spiritual Life, is Ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary, for Begin|ing, and Abounding in the Work of the Lord: And Supplication to the Lord is to be Attended by them, that would Experience a work of Rege|neration.</P>
<P>WHILE Souls are in the Kingdom and under the Power of Satan, they will not do the Work of the Lord: Therefore mu&s;t People Pray to God, that being Delivered out of the Hands of their E|nemies, and from the Power of Darkne&s;s, and
<PB N="48" REF="004487_0025_100D56F401F15080">Tran&s;lated into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and having a New Heart put into them and the Spirit of Life given to them, they may Serve the Lord, and <HI>Abound in the Work of the Lord,</HI> without any Sinful Fear, in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s before Him, all the Days of their Life.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> TAKE heed of Mi&s;taking, about the Af|fairs of your Souls. Be not Deceived, in Thinking that you are in a Good State, if you are not really turned from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Pow|er of Satan to God, and have not Received the Forgivene&s;s of Sin, through Faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>IF you don't lay a good Foundation, upon the Rock, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by a True Faith in a Sound Repentance, with a Good Knowledge of, and a Firm A&s;&s;ent to the Truths of God, you may &s;eem to do Well for a while, and <HI>Abound</HI> in Good things, But there is Danger, that you will Decay and your Leaves may Wither and Fall. There|fore Search &amp; Try, that you may Know Your&s;elves. It is Advi&s;ed, in 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine Your&s;elves.</HI> Thou&s;ands Peri&s;h by Pre&s;umption. They Think that things are well with their Souls. And they Hope, that they are well. But they will not Examine them&s;elves, to Know certainly how things are: And &s;o they are Undone for ever. They hope that they have Believed and Repented and are in a &s;afe State: But are not willing to be at the Pains for an Impartial, Penetrating Self.
<PB N="49" REF="004487_0025_100D56F401F15080">Examination, &s;o as to Know thorowly the State of their Souls, and &s;o they Spend their Days under the Influence of their Vain Hopes, until they lye down in Eternal Sorrow. Therefore be wi&s;e, to make a thorow Tryal: And be not Satisfied until you are Certified that Chri&s;t is yours and you are His. And if you be really in Chri&s;t, then He will Strengthen you with Strength in your Soul to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> SET about the Work of God now; in this pre&s;ent time: Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God. Make ha&s;te, without delay, to keep the Commandments of the Lord. Young People &s;hould begin Pre&s;ently: Now while they are Young, to do the Work of God. And all Peo|ple &s;hould be Careful, to Improve the Pre&s;ent time, or they will not as they &s;hould Abound in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> BE Sincere in all you Endeavours about Religion. Hypocrites Frequently turn Apo&s;tates. Pray to God, that your Hearts may be Sound in the Statutes of the Lord, and Right in the Sight of God. If you'l Abound in His Work. Be not Carele&s;s about the Secret Duties of Chri&s;ti|anity. Let the Holy Angels of God &s;ee that you Fray in Secret unto God, as your Hea|venly Father con&s;tantly every Day. Be not

They that are engaged in pur&s;uing the Plea&s;ures, the Trea|&s;ures, and the Honours of this World, will not Abound in the Work of the Lord.

And Beg Par|don for the Sake of Chri&s;t, for all that hath been Ami&s;s, before you Venture to lye down to Sleep. And try to Sleep in the Love of God. An Heathen would Condemn the Chri&s;tian, that &s;hould Neglect all this Work of an Evening Self|Examination.</P>
<P>BUT all the Lords Day &s;hould be Spent in the Secret, Private and Publick Duties of Re|ligion, except what the Works of Nece&s;&s;ity and Compa&s;&s;ion Require: And they &s;hould be At|tended with &s;uch Holy Frames of Souls that we may be going toward Heaven, while we are At|tending tho&s;e Works. And the little Spaces of Time, that bye between the Stated Exerci&s;es of Religion &s;hould be filled with U&s;eful Thoughts, about Spiritual and Eternal Things, that we may be in the Spirit all the Lords Day and Fini&s;h the Day with God.</P>
<P>AND upon every Particular and Remarkable Undertaking, we &s;hould Think, will this be for the Glory of God? And how may it be be&s;t Managed for His Glory?

<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> ALWAYS Repair to, and Rely on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for Con&s;tant Supplies of New Grace, for every Exerci&s;e. Venture upon nothing, without looking to Chri&s;t, for New Grace to Help through all.</P>
<P>NEVER Imagine that you can do any thing without the Grace of Chri&s;t Helping. Strive to be Able to &s;ay as He could in Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things, through Chri&s;t Enabling me.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a Duty is to be Performed, look to Chri&s;t for Grace, to Perform the Duty, when a Mercy is to be Improved, look to Chri&s;t, for Grace to Improve the Mercy.</P>
<P>WHEN a Trial is to be Endured, look to Chri&s;t for Grace to Endure it well.</P>
<P>WHEN a Corruption is to be Conquered, look to Chri&s;t, for Grace to overcome the Cor|ruption.</P>
<P>SO when a Temptation is to be Re&s;i&s;ted, look to Chri&s;t, for Succour and for A&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="54" REF="004487_0028_100D56FC4D134270">to Encounter the Temptation well and to Main|tain Humility, after the Victory over the Tempta|tion. So do all in the Name of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ACKNOWLEDGE that all Grace mu&s;t come from the Everla&s;ting Love of God the Father, as Purcha&s;ed, by the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and Applied by the Holy Spirit, unto your Souls, mo&s;t freely; both Inherent Grace and A&s;&s;i&s;ting Grace; Directing Grace and Exciting Grace; Preventing, Upholding and Accepting Grace.</P>
<P>WHILE you Pre&s;erve your Union with Chri&s;t, by a Living Faith, Maintain your Communion with Chri&s;t, by a Working Faith, Deriving Grace from Chri&s;t, to Live to God and Work for God. So Live by Faith on the Son of God: Then will you Abound in the Work of the Lord, and be coming nearer and nearer unto the Happine&s;s of always Abounding in that De&s;ire-able Work. But,</P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> PRAYING always with all Prayer and Sup|plication Watching thereunto with all Per&s;eve|rance, mu&s;t be Remembred by them that would be &s;o Happy as always to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>PRAYER is a great part of our Work, and it mu&s;t be Attended, or no part of our Work will be well Attended: But there is other Work to be Attended be&s;ides Prayer: Therefore when we are Advi&s;ed, to be Praying always (and to
<PB N="55" REF="004487_0028_100D56FC4D134270">Pray continually, and to continue in Prayer:) It cannot intend, that we have nothing to do, But to Pray: But the meaning is, that we &s;hould always keep a Frame, for Prayer, and always mind the Time for Prayer; and be very often at the Work of Prayer. Abound in that Work.</P>
<P>ALL the Children of God &s;hould Wait on their Heavenly Father Night and Day with Pray|er, in their Secret Places.</P>
<P>ALL the Servants of God &s;hould wait on the Lord, with Prayer, Morning and Evening, in their Private Families.</P>
<P>ALL the People of God &s;hould wait on the Lord, with Prayer, on the Lords Day, in their Publick A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>THESE are the Ordinary Prayers, that they &s;hould Attend, that would Abound in the Work of the Lord. But Extraordinary Prayers mu&s;t not be Neglected: They &s;hould be Attended many times in a Year: Nor mu&s;t Ejaculatory Prayers be Neglected. They &s;hould be Attended many times in an Hour, by them that always A|bound in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>AND Watching mu&s;t be joined with our Praying. We mu&s;t Watch before Duty, Watch in Duty and Watch after Duty. Watch, To di&s;cern what we may do for the Glory of God, and Watch, To defear the Devices of our Foes, and Watch again&s;t all the Beginnings of, or Ten|dencies
<PB N="56" REF="004487_0029_100D56FDF7E63610">to Apo&s;tacy from God. And Watchfully Ob&s;erve and Improve all Opportunities to do Good, as well as Watch in Prayer. And after all Watch again&s;t all Pride, on Account of our Doing any thing, that we may through Grace, hope is well done. For,</P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> SELF-denial and Humility mu&s;t not be for|gotten, by them that would Abound Always in the Work of the Lord. When our Lord was giving Le&s;&s;ons for them that would Engage in His Work, He &s;aid in Mat. 16.24. <HI>If any Man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me.</HI></P>
<P>SINFUL Self mu&s;t be Denied <HI>Ab&s;olutely.</HI> We mu&s;t Deny all Ungodline&s;s &amp; worldly Lu&s;ts, Hate every Fal&s;e way, hate vain Thoughts, They mu&s;t not lodge in our Souls. We mu&s;t be for Perfec|tion of Holine&s;s, before God.</P>
<P>THEN Righteous Self mu&s;t be Denied <HI>Re|&s;pectively;</HI> In point of Ju&s;tification we mu&s;t Re|nounce all Reliance on our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And while we go on, about the Work of the Lord, in the Strength of the Lord, make mention of His Righteousne&s;s and that alone; &s;aying, in the Lord have I Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength.</P>
<P>AND Relative Self mu&s;t be Denied <HI>Compara|tively,</HI> &s;o that we mu&s;t be ready to For&s;ake all Relations rather than leave the Work of the Lord.</P>

YEA, Natural Self mu&s;t be Denied <HI>Conditionally,</HI> &s;o that we mu&s;t be willing to part with Ea&s;e, Health and Life, rather than to Neglect the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>BUT then, Be &s;ure all, Unnece&s;&s;ary, Unprofita|ble Familiarity with Ungodly Company mu&s;t be Abandoned, by them that would Abound in the Work of the Lord: They that will keep the Com|mandments of God, mu&s;t &s;ay, Depart from me, ye workers of Iniquity. They mu&s;t deny them&s;elves of the Company not only of Prophane Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors, but al&s;o of Formal Profe&s;&s;ors; for both will hinder from Always Abounding in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>AND they mu&s;t take up their Cro&s;s, in their Expectation of Trouble and in their Preparation for Trouble, before it comes, and in their Hum|ble and Patient Su&s;tentation of Trouble, when God brings Trouble upon them; yea, though the Trouble may come, on Account of their doing well, and becau&s;e they Abound in the Work of God.</P>
<P>SO mu&s;t they Follow the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, both by Obedience to Him, and by Imitation of Him and they mu&s;t Imitate Him in His Meek|ne&s;s, Lowline&s;s, Humility and Patience. And let Patience have her Perfect Work, that they may be Perfect and Intire wanting nothing.</P>
<P>THEN after all the&s;e things, they that would always Abound in the Work of the Lord, mu&s;t

For that is Part of the Le&s;&s;on, that they mu&s;t always Remem|ber, in Luk. 17.10. <HI>When ye &s;hall have done all tho&s;e things, which are Commanded you, &s;ay, we are Unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</HI> We De&s;erve nothing, but have rea&s;on to be Thankful to God, that He will Accept and Improve us in His Service. It is a great Favour, an high Honour, that the Glo|rious and Eternal King of the World, will give us Leave, to do any Work for Him, and will give Grace to us, to do His Work &s;o, that we may be Accepted, for the Sake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND therefore, though we may have a Re|&s;pect unto the Recompence of the Reward, in the Heavenly World for the Encouragement of our Souls in the Work of God, yet we mu&s;t not think, that we De&s;erve any of that Re|ward, by any of our Works, though we Abound never &s;o much in Good Works. But after all our Abounding in the Work of God, we mu&s;t look for Mercy. And the Reward mu&s;t be Freely Be&s;tow|ed, by the Free Grace of God.</P>
<P>AND though we &s;eem, to Labour in Vain, and Spend our Strength for Nought and in Vain,

<P><HI>MOSES</HI> may take many Thou&s;ands of weary Steps, towards the Promi&s;ed Land, with Hopes, at length, to arrive there; And yet after all mu&s;t be contented without ever &s;etting his Foot on the De&s;ired Land.</P>

<P>FOR it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, as in mo&s;t Congregations, where the Go&s;pel hath been Preached Faithfully for any con&s;iderable Time, &s;o in this Congregation, there be two &s;orts of People to whom the Preceeding things have been Propo&s;ed.
