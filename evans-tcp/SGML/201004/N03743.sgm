<P>THE following Queries and Remarks <HI>&s;eem</HI> to us to concern Matters of the utmo&s;t Im|portance. We are repre&s;ented in Scripture as Pilgrims and Travellers to a better Country; and as a <HI>wrong Choice of the Road</HI> may ruin us eternally, we ought to <HI>examine</HI> every Step we tread, and take Notice that our Guides be not <HI>blind</HI> nor <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> le&s;t they lead us a&s;tray. None can blame us when our Souls are in Danger of eternal Ruin, to look to our &s;elves, and to &s;ecure the one Thing need|ful; nor dare we allow our&s;elves to fellow the Multitude, if we fear they go a&s;tray; nor re|gard any Man further than he follows Chri&s;t: And we hope this will ju&s;tify us in what we have done in the following Pages; for, if all our Chri&s;tian Brethren, who may think it worth while to read our Remarks, have &s;uch
<PB N="v" REF="004588_0005_100D834B1E70ADC8">
&s;uperior Attainmments as to <HI>&s;ee clearly,</HI> that all that Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> has printed, is &s;ound and agreeable to the holy Scriptures; yet we hope that their Chri&s;tian Charity is &s;o great, that they will not condemn us for applying as we have done to our Teachers, and by their Advice to Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI> him&s;elf, to remove &s;ome un|happy Stumbling-Blocks out of our Way. We cannot help thinking for our&s;elves and judging of Things according to the Light they appear in; and we promi&s;e, that when that Gentle|man &s;atisfies us in the&s;e Things, we will be|lieve him; and we <HI>cannot</HI> do it &s;ooner. But when we reflect, that he is but a Man; that great and good Men have <HI>been mi&s;taken;</HI> and that Infalibility <HI>(as far as we know)</HI> is entailed neither on him nor his followers, we hope that both he and they are better Chri&s;tians than to blame us if we can be the In&s;truments of pointing out their Mi&s;takes, <HI>if there be any:</HI> We believe, that they regard their Souls, and will look on it as the mo&s;t eminent Service can be done them, if by our Means they receive a Kindne&s;s that will turn to their Account, through a boundle&s;s Eternity.</P>
<P>We confe&s;s, that we are at a Lo&s;s to know what to make of &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions; if they have <HI>any Meaning at all,</HI> we fear it is
<PB N="vi" REF="004588_0006_100DA599A0257248">
a bad one; and will rejoice to find our&s;elves di&s;appointed, if he &s;hews us that they are &s;ound and good. But if he pretends Hurry or Want of Time, and <HI>does not either ju&s;tify</HI> or <HI>condemn them,</HI> or give us <HI>&s;ome Satisfac|tion,</HI> he will <HI>con&s;train</HI> us to think, that he has his own <HI>Glory</HI> in View more than the <HI>Glory</HI> of God or the <HI>Good</HI> of his Church. He has &s;uch <HI>high</HI> Conceptions of Man, or &s;uch <HI>low</HI> Con|ceptions of God, that we fear he has <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Conceptions of neither; to &s;ay, "That Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, That he was the Perfection of the <HI>mo|ral</HI> and <HI>material World,</HI>" as he does, <HI>Pag. 17. Vol. 2d. of Sermons,</HI> is what we can <HI>neither believe,</HI> nor find Ground from Rea&s;on nor Revelation to &s;upport it. When our Divines prove the Divinity of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, they &s;ometimes do it <HI>(we think to a good Purpo&s;e)</HI> by proving, that the Scriptures attribute to him <HI>all the Perfections of the Deity,</HI> and of Con|&s;equence that he is the eternal God, equal with the Father and Holy Spirit; but if a <HI>meer Man</HI> may be adorned with <HI>all the&s;e Per|fections,</HI> we know not what to make of this Argument, 'till he give us better Light.</P>
<P>Again if Men be baptized <HI>into the Nature</HI> of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, as he &s;eems
<PB N="vii" REF="004588_0007_100DA59B2C816AD8">
to a&s;&s;ert, <HI>p. 128, vol. 2.</HI> is not this to make them, on their Conver&s;ion, Partakers of the Godhead, or &s;omeway equal to the Supream Being? What &s;hall we think of the Doctrine, that one while <HI>finks us</HI> into <HI>Brutes and Di|vels,</HI> and <HI>again exalts</HI> us to be equal to <HI>God?</HI> This puts us in Mind of &s;ome <HI>Antinomian</HI> Reveries, of being goded with God, and chri&s;ted with Chri&s;t: And we hope the Rea|ders will pardon us, tho' we de&s;ire to get Light in the&s;e Things, &s;eeing it is our great Concern to have <HI>right Notions of God</HI> and <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and to Act accordingly.</P>
<P>When we hear him tell us, "That the Re|generate wa&s;hes away the Guilt of Sin <HI>by the Tears</HI> of a &s;incere Repentance, <HI>joined with</HI> Faith in the Blood of Chri&s;t," <HI>p. 22, 23. vol. 2.</HI> we think that it &s;avours of <HI>Popery and Arminiani&s;m,</HI> to join any Thing with the Blood of Chri&s;t to wa&s;h away Sin; and hope it will offend none, that we cannot believe this on his <HI>bare Word</HI> contrary to many Scrip|ture Texts, for we abhor an implicit Faith. Is not that Expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame <HI>Stamp? Vol. 1, p. 7.</HI> Where he &s;ays, "That a &s;in|gle Aim at God's Glory, &mdash; <HI>alone</HI> can ren|der our Actions <HI>acceptable</HI> in God's Sight:" If a &s;ingle Aim at God's Glory <HI>alone</HI> can ren|der
<PB N="viii" REF="004588_0008_100DA59D48F81CB0">
our Actions acceptable in his Sight, what need is there for the Blood of Chri&s;t? We hope none of our Brethren will be offended, that we cannot believe this <HI>popi&s;h</HI> Doctrine, till he explain or prove it from Scripture.</P>
<P>He further tells us, <HI>p. 128. vol. 2.</HI> (if we mi&s;take him not) "That our Lord commanded his Di&s;ciples to baptize Men <HI>into</HI> the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t," which is either to convert them, or rather to make them equal with God: And if he has given Men <HI>Ability</HI> to do either the one or the other, by repeating the Words of the In&s;titution; Why <HI>may</HI> they not as ea&s;ily change a Wafer into his Body and Blood? And this <HI>&s;mells of Po|pery,</HI> and will <HI>&s;upport</HI> the Doctrine of Tran|&s;ub&s;tantion. &mdash; When he tells us, "That we mu&s;t be ju&s;tified by the inherent Righteous|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, "if by this he intends our Sanc|tification, or good Habits, and good Works per|formed by the Aid of the Spirit, does not he here again give another <HI>fair Invitation</HI> to bring us to <HI>Rome?</HI> And we hope we will be excu&s;ed from <HI>&s;etting</HI> our Face <HI>that Way,</HI> till we be once convinced, that it is the <HI>&s;ure Road</HI> to eternal Happine&s;s. Are not the&s;e Doctrines full of <HI>Arminiani&s;m?</HI> And 'tis no Wonder, that we are &s;urprized to find them in his <HI>own

Writings,</HI> and to hear him <HI>continually ap|plaud</HI> Mr. <HI>We&s;tly,</HI> who (we are informed) is an <HI>Arminian,</HI> when we find him cry them down in <HI>all but</HI> them&s;elves: We <HI>dete&s;t</HI> the&s;e <HI>Errors</HI> in both, and cannot &s;ee through this Piece of Management.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly by inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in <HI>vol. 1. p. 16.</HI> he under&s;tands the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t inherent in us; if &s;o, we hope every one will de&s;ire to know, as well as our|&s;elves, how the <HI>infinite Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t can inhere in a <HI>finite</HI> Creature? Unle&s;s, as has been already ob&s;erved, he make the Believer in &s;ome Mea&s;ure equal with God; but when we compare this with Mr. <HI>Flavel's 2d Appendix, vol. 1.

When he tells us in his Letter again&s;t the Book, entitled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man, p. 4,</HI> and <HI>5.</HI> "That <HI>God never made a &s;econd Covenant with</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004588_0010_100DA5A0CCB806F8">

We cannot take his <HI>bare Word,</HI> while we think that above <HI>one hundred and Fifty Texts</HI> in our Bibles a&s;&s;ert the <HI>contrary.</HI> How many of our able&s;t Divines have long &s;ince re|futed this wild <HI>Antinomian Notion?</HI> And among others, Mr. <HI>Flavel, Vol. 1.

<P>When we find him, <HI>vol. 1. p. 7.</HI> giving Rea|&s;ons why Men mu&s;t be <HI>New Creatures,</HI> in order to <HI>qualify them</HI> to be <HI>&s;avingly in Chri&s;t,</HI> Why does he condemn Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on;</HI> Letter fir&s;t again&s;t the Archbi&s;hop, <HI>page the 3d.</HI> for &s;hewing the Nature of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and its <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> in order to <HI>our Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Salvation?</HI> Is not the <HI>New Creature</HI> in Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and the <HI>Regenerate</HI> in the Archbi&s;hop's Words, of the <HI>&s;ame Meaning</HI> and <HI>Import?</HI> Is not <HI>being &s;avingly in Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Fir&s;t <HI>expre&s;&s;es</HI> it, and <HI>obtain|ing Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> as the other <HI>has</HI> it, the very &s;ame Thing?

<HEAD>The <HI>ADDRESS</HI> of &s;everal Per&s;ons of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion, being Members of &s;everal Congregations in our Bounds, to the Presbytery of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> met at <HI>Whiteclay Creek, September</HI> the Ninth, <HI>1740.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE venerable and &s;acred Cha|racter the Reverend Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> bears, as an incomparable Reformer; and the high Com|mendations given to his publick Perform|ances and Writings, both from the Pulpit and Pre&s;s, as well as in private Conference, and that, by &s;ome Mini&s;ters and People of our own Denomination, having rai&s;ed our Expectations very high, we were induced to attend his Sermons, and to read and per|u&s;e his Books, hoping to receive much Light and Benefit thereby: But, upon the
<PB N="14" REF="004588_0014_100DA5AB70DA1698">
be&s;t Peru&s;al we could make of them, al|beit, we find that great Part of his Writ|ings do an&s;wer the Character given them, as being &s;ound, yet, to our great Surprize, we every now and then &s;tumble upon &s;omething that &s;eems to jar with tho&s;e &s;ounder Parts, as well as with other good Books; and, if we be not mi&s;taken, with Scripture and &s;ound Rea&s;on.&mdash; Our Jea|lou&s;ies hereanent, whether Right or Wrong, giving us &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, we were much perplexed what to do: If we &s;hould think of going to &s;ome of Mr <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s warm Adherents, we were afraid, by Rea&s;on of the Treatment that others (and it may be &s;ome of our&s;elves) met with, that nothing could be expected thereby, but incen&s;ing them again&s;t us, to call us blind and carnal Men, as u&s;ual. Now tho' Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> him&s;elf, by &s;ome Part of his Writings, would &s;eem to be a Man of another Spirit and Sentiments from &s;uch warm incon&s;i|derate Adherents, as appears by many Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in his Letters again&s;t Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> and the Author of <HI>The Whole Duty of Man;</HI> particularly by his taxing the Di&s;|&s;enters for acting very partially, for not &s;peaking &s;o explicitly as they ought again&s;t

the Archbi&s;hop's Doctrine, when known to be contrary to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, al|beit, the Arch-bi&s;hop was their Friend, and behaved with much Moderation towards them, whil&s;t he lived; we cannot &s;ee, how be could, con&s;i&s;tent with this, tax any of the Lovers of Truth for acting unchri&s;tianly, for enquiring into the Rea&s;ons of &s;ome of his A&s;&s;ertions, when we judge that they appear to us as contrary to Truth as &s;ome of the &s;aid Archbi&s;hop's Doctrines: For, if we mi&s;take not, it is the Duty and pri|viledge of every doubting Chri&s;tian, to enquire into the Rea&s;ons of the plaine&s;t Scripture Doctrine, when he he&s;itates about it: But we &s;hould not &s;peak explicitly a|gain&s;t any Doctrine, but what upon mature Deliberation we have found fal&s;e. But when we con&s;ider the Treatment a Neigh|bouring Mini&s;ter had from Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI>'s warm Adherents, and their Cries &s;till a|gain&s;t him for de&s;iring a Conference with Mr. <HI>Whitfield,</HI> about &s;ome Points in his Ser|mon, which &s;aid Mini&s;ter was in Doubts about; we do di&s;pair of Acce&s;s to him.</P>
<P>The only Remedy therefore left us, to &s;olve us of our Doubts, as we &s;ee, is, an Ad|dre&s;s to you our Teachers, now in Pre&s;by|tery

met, and &s;etting our Scruples in order before you: And we promi&s;e, that if you, or any of you, can &s;atisfy us with Scrip|ture and &s;ound Rea&s;on, we &s;hall not only chearfully &s;ubmit to the &s;ame, but al&s;o re|turn you our mo&s;t hearty Thanks, as coun|ting the Di&s;covery of Truth our Gain and Joy. But if you decline, or cannot agree among your&s;elves, about &s;olving us herein, we de&s;ire your Judgments, whether it be any Breach of Order, for us, at our own Expences, and &s;uch as &s;hall join with us, to put our Scruples into Print, that &s;o there may be an Opportunity given to Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> to clear his Doctrine, if mi&s;repre&s;ented or mi&s;apprehended by us: And that we may make a fair E&s;&s;ay to have our Doubts cleared, which for the pre&s;ent &s;eem to be Bars and Letts to hinder us to join with our Chri&s;tian Brethren in Matters of Com|mon Concern, with that Onene&s;s of Mind and Heart, which is de&s;irable and nece&s;&s;ary for our mutual Comfort: For when one Side is as zealous for, as the other is jea|lous of a controverted Point, and A&s;&s;ertions about it in Matters of Con&s;cience, it is well known how Difficult it is to go Hand in Hand. We find by Experience, that the

other &s;ide have their Difficulties to enter|tain a good Opinion of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that except again&s;t &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ions as un&s;ound: And we, accord|ing to our pre&s;ent Light, find it hard to en|tertain a good Opinion of tho&s;e that pro|claim all his Doctrines &s;ound in the &s;trong|e&s;t Terms. We have therefore endeavour|ed to put our Scruples in the mo&s;t inoffen|&s;ive Way we could, by not only tran&s;crib|ing &s;ome Paragraphs out of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Printed Writings; but al&s;o, according to our Capacities, we have endeavoured to propo&s;e our Doubts by rai&s;ing proper Que|ries upon &s;uch Paragraphs, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in his Sermon on <HI>Acts</HI> 19.5. <HI>Page.</HI> 5. * where &s;peaking of Man's Creation, he has the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>He, <HI>that is God,</HI> breathed into Man the Breath of &s;piritual Life, and his Soul be|came adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. Mu&s;t not that Man have either very diminutive Thoughts of God, or el&s;e mon|&s;trou&s;ly exalted Thoughts of Man, that can think, much more &s;peak and write, that the Soul of Man in its be&s;t State was a|dorned with all the Perfections of the Dei|ty!
<PB N="18" REF="004588_0018_100DA5B44CD7B458">
What then is become of the Di&s;tinc|tion, that all &s;ound Divines make between the communicable and incommunicable At|tributes of God? Doth not Scripture and Rea&s;on &s;upport this nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinction? if the Soul of Man was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity, without Ex|ception of any, what is the native and ne|ce&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence therefrom, but that the Soul then was in &s;ome &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt equal to God; which is too horrid to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, without a De|te&s;tation of it? Were not Expre&s;&s;ions of this Import condemn'd for Bla&s;phemies in the Mouths of <HI>Fox</HI> and <HI>Naylor?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. In the &s;ame Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 9. [<HI>Vol.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 22, 23.] Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> &s;peaking of the Re|generate, when fallen into Sin, hath the&s;e Words: <Q><HI>He,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Regenerate Per&s;on, quickly</HI> Ri&s;es <HI>again, and goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly,</HI> wa&s;hes away the Guilt of Sin, by the Tears <HI>of a &s;incere Re|pentance,</HI> join'd with Faith in the <HI>Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> I. Is not the Blood of Chri&s;t to be applied by Faith, the <HI>&s;ole</HI> or <HI>only</HI> Laver, to wa&s;h away the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.7. 'Tis true, Faith in grown Believers, to make Application of his Blood to the Soul, mu&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="004588_0019_100DA5B5E3508318">

<P>Before we come to propo&s;e Queries on this Head, it will not be ami&s;s to premi&s;e a Word or two, to prevent Mi&s;takes, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We freely grant that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is our &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> our common Head and Surity in the &s;econd Covenant, and that the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> was only a private Believer or Per&s;on, and &s;o mu&s;t come in, or enter into Covenant with God by or thro' a Me|diator, and at a &s;econd Hand (if we may &s;o &s;peak) as well as we his Po&s;terity.

<P>Whether the next Paragraph that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> condemns may bear a favourable Con&s;truction, we leave you to judge; but we cannot but heartily join with him in &s;hewing our Di&s;like to what&s;oever in <HI>any Author may mi&s;lead the Weak or Ignorant, or countenance the Erroneous:</HI> Yet, whether this may lay Foundation for &s;uch a <HI>hard Cen&s;ure</HI> as that he was <HI>not a Real Chri&s;tian at Heart,</HI> or had not &s;o much as <HI>a Head Knowledge of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> a&s;&s;erts, is what we are at a Lo&s;s to determine? How would Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> or &s;ome of his warm Adherents, like it, if another would take the &s;ame Liberty to cen&s;ure his Writings, and him for them, to the &s;ame Degree? Upon the like Ground, we mu&s;t, and do condemn the Author of <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> for a&s;&s;erting that the &s;econd Covenant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, if thereby is meant, his be|ing our publick Head and Surety in the &s;econd Covenant.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. How can Chri&s;t be a Mediator of the new Covenant, if there be no other Par|ties in the Covenant, but God the Father, and Chri&s;t engaging for us? Mu&s;t not the Elect or Believers, be con&s;idered as a third Party in the &s;econd Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. How can the new Covenant be called a Te&s;tament, and Chri&s;t the Te&s;tator of it, if there be no Parties in it but the Father and him? He receives all from the Father as Mediator: On whom then doth he be&s;tow Legacies, without there be a third Party in this Covenant?</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="004588_0028_100DA5C94BD7AD60"><HI>Q.</HI> IV. How can any ju&s;tify Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>'s Calling the &s;econd Covenant <HI>a bare Promi&s;e,</HI> and that in a Way of <HI>Di&s;tinction from</HI> and <HI>Oppo&s;ition to</HI> its being a Covenant? when the Apo&s;tle calls it, in Re&s;pect of the &s;everal Editions of it, <HI>the Covenants of Pro|mi&s;e, Eph.</HI> 2.12.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> VII. If it be &s;aid, that the &s;econd Co|venant could not be made with <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his Po&s;terity, becau&s;e it was made primarily with Chri&s;t; may not we as well &s;ay, that the fir&s;t Covenant was not at all made with us, becau&s;e it was made pri|marily with <HI>Adam,</HI> as our Surety and Co|venant Head? Was not the very mak|ing of the fir&s;t Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> as a publick Per&s;on, the making of that Cove|nant at lea&s;t virtually with us in him? Was not the making of the &s;econd Cove|nant with Chri&s;t as a publick Per&s;on, vir|tualy the making that Covenant with us?

Do not Believers, when they come to believe and profe&s;s Faith in Chri&s;t, as expre&s;sly and explicitly enter under the Bond of the &s;econd Covenant, as any of the Sons of <HI>A|dam</HI> ever entered into the Bond of the fir&s;t?

<P>I Have &s;een your printed An&s;wer to certain <HI>Queries</HI> lately publi&s;hed, and ob&s;erve with great Satisfaction, the Evidence you there give of a truly Chri&s;tian Humility.

<P>IN your An&s;wer to the <HI>Queries</HI> you &s;ay, That to the Honour of free di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Grace, you recieved the Spirit of A|doption, before you had conver&s;ed with one Man, or read a &s;ingle Book, on the Doctrine of <HI>Free Ju&s;tification by the Imputed Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu'll excu&s;e the Trouble of this, by Way of Supplement to my former Letters, and containing al&s;o a few Queries concerning your pre&s;ent Behaviour as a Pre&s;byter of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot but know, that to bring a criminal Accu&s;ation again&s;t any one, with|out &s;ufficient Evidence or Proof to &s;upport it, is wilful and malicious Slander: But, this, Sir, you have done again&s;t your Bre|thren of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in your <HI>Sermon</HI> entitled, <HI>What think ye of Chri&s;t.</HI> In
<PB N="78" REF="004588_0078_100DA64399D51920">
that Sermon (<HI>P.</HI> 18.) you have accu&s;ed them, of <HI>not Preaching the Truth as it is in</HI> Je&s;us; of <HI>falling from our e&s;tabli&s;h'd Doctrines;</HI> and of <HI>preaching only the Law</HI> and <HI>not &s;hew|ing the Way of Salvation by Faith in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that is of preaching Ju&s;tification by Works, and not by Faith only. Thus you have accu&s;ed your Brethren in that <HI>Sermon;</HI> but where are the Proofs of your Accu&s;ation? What Evidence have you therein brought to &s;upport your Charge? Not the lea&s;t Shadow or Appearance of any &s;uch Thing throughout the Whole. &mdash; But what Need (you'll &s;ay) of Proof in &s;o plain a Ca&s;e? The <HI>Clergy</HI> indeed pretend to Preach the true Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith only;</HI> but in explaining, do they not de&s;troy it? Do they not explain it, as the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> in his 4th Pa&s;tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Letter, <HI>hopes</HI> they do; <HI>viz. That the Faith by which only we are ju&s;tified mu&s;t be true and lively or productive of good Works,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>That good Works are a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Condition</HI> (included in that Faith) <HI>of our being ju&s;tified in the Sight of God?</HI> And is not this explaining the Doctrine into a Contradiction? Is it not <HI>preaching a new Go&s;pel?</HI> Preaching <HI>Ju&s;tification by Works, and not by Faith only.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="004588_0079_100DA6464A3C1E00">Well then, the Doctrine the Clergy preach, which you are &s;o angry at, and cen|&s;ure as preaching Ju&s;tification by <HI>Works, and not by Faith only,</HI> is this; that <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith only and not by Works;</HI> thus explained, <HI>viz. that we are ju&s;tified by &s;uch a Faith only, as is true and lively that is ac|tually producing good Fruits or Works, and con&s;equently implying them as a nece&s;&s;ary con|dition</HI> (but no meritorious Cau&s;e) <HI>of our Ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>This then, I &s;ay, is the Doctrine which you cen&s;ure, and are &s;o angry at: But which notwith&s;tanding is indeed the true Doctrine of the Go&s;pel; &mdash; and agreeab|ly, taught by the ancient Fathers, by the <HI>Church of England;</HI> by her Clergy at all Times; and (be not &s;urprized!) the very Doctrine taught by your <HI>Reverence</HI> and Bre|thren <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> tho' not without apparent Shuffle and Contradiction, di&s;gui&s;ed under the Di&s;tinction of <HI>before</HI> and <HI>after</HI> Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Doctrine you condemn, is the true Doctrine of the Go&s;pel. &mdash; <HI>We are ju&s;tified by Faith and</HI> not by Works, teacheth St. <HI>Paul;</HI> that is (expoundeth St. <HI>James</HI>) not by <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Faith as is <HI>without</HI> Works; for Faith, if <HI>it hath not Works, is dead being
<PB N="80" REF="004588_0080_100DA648C1B3E1F0">
alone;</HI> but by a lively operative Faith, pro|ducing the Fruit of good Works, <HI>by Works is Faith made Perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This al&s;o is the Doctrine of all the ancient Fathers. &mdash; <HI>We are ju&s;tified by Faith and not by Works,</HI> taught <HI>Clemens, Ori|gen, Cyprian, Ba&s;il, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Au&s;tin,</HI> &amp;c. that is, <Q>not &s;o meant of them,' (Hom. of Salv. Part 2d.) that the &s;aid ju&s;tifying Faith is alone in Man, without true Re|pentance, Hope, Charity, and the Fear of God at any Time or Sea&s;on: But this &s;aying that we be ju&s;tified by Faith only, freely and without Works, is &s;poken, for <HI>to take away clearly</HI> ALL MERIT <HI>of our Works,</HI> as being unable to de&s;erve our Ju&s;|tification at God's Hands; &mdash; and whol|ly to a&s;cribe the Merit of our Ju&s;tification unto Chri&s;t only, and his mo&s;t precious Blood&s;hedding.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;ame Doctrine al&s;o teacheth the Church of <HI>England. We are accounted righ|teous</HI> (or ju&s;tified) <HI>before God only for the Merits of our Lord and Saviour</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>by Faith, and not for our own Works or De&s;er|vings.</HI> Art. 11. <Q>That is, (&s;aith Hom. of Faith) not by a dead or barren, but a lively and fruitful Faith. &mdash; Good living
<PB N="81" REF="004588_0081_100DA64AF43CAA58">
cannot be &s;eparated from true Faith, which worketh by Love; &mdash; and Faith of it&s;elf is full of good Works; as &s;oon as a Man believeth he is garni&s;hed with them. &mdash; And by all the Declarations of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> it is evident, that a true and Chri&s;tian Faith, is no dead, vain, or un|fruitful Thing; but a Thing of perfect Virtue, of wonderful Operation, Working and Strength, bringing forth all good Motions, and good Works.</Q> <HI>See Hom.</HI> of <HI>Salvat.</HI> and &s;hort Declar. of a true and live|ly Faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. And as of the Church, &s;o agreeably is this the Doctrine at all Times preached by her Clergy. &mdash; <HI>We are ju&s;tified by Faith on|ly and not by Works;</HI> &mdash; <Q>And yet (&s;aith Bi&s;hop <HI>Downam,</HI> Treat. of Ju&s;tific. P. 15.) that Faith which is alone, &s;evered from all other inward Graces, and outward O|bedience, doth not ju&s;tify either alone, or at all; becau&s;e it is not a true and lively, but a counterfeit and dead Faith.</Q> Ag|reeably al&s;o Bi&s;hop <HI>Beveridge</HI> on the 39th Art. (Art. 11.) <Q>Tho' it be by Faith (&s;aith he) that we are ju&s;tified, and by Faith only, yet not by &s;uch a Faith as hath no Works accompanying it: No, every &s;uch
<PB N="82" REF="004588_0082_100DA64D3B71BE30">
Faith is a dead Faith; &s;o that Faith with|out Works is as unable to ju&s;tify us, as Works without Faith. And yet it is not from our Works that accompany our Faith, but from the Faith that is accom|panied by our Works, that we are ju&s;tifi|ed.</Q> &mdash;Thus Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> al&s;o (on the &s;ame 11th Art.) <Q>A Man is then only ju&s;tified when he is freed from Wrath, and is at Peace with God. And tho' this is freely offered to us in the Go&s;pel through <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> yet it is applied to none, but &s;uch as come within tho&s;e Qua|lifications &s;et before us in the Go&s;pel. That God pardons Sin and receives us in|to Favour, only through the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed in the Go&s;pel, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to doubt of it. Nor is it le&s;s evident, that it is not offered to us ab&s;olutely, and without Conditions and Limitations. The&s;e Conditions are <HI>Repentance,</HI> with which <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> often joined; and <HI>Faith;</HI> but a <HI>Faith that worketh by Love, that purifies the Heart;</HI> and <HI>that keeps the Commandments of God.</HI> Such a Faith as &s;hews it&s;elf to be alive by good Works by Acts of Charity, and every Act of Obedience. Such a

<HI>Faith</HI> as this <HI>ju&s;tifies;</HI> but not as it is a Work or meritorious Action, but as it is the Condition upon which the Mercy of God is offered to us by <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> &mdash; Our Faith and Repentance are not the va|luable Con&s;iderations for which God par|dons and ju&s;tifies; that is done merely for the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> &mdash; But &s;till our Faith, which includes our Hope, our Love, our Repentance and Obedience, is the Condition that makes us capable of receiving the Benefit of this Redemption and free Grace.</Q></P>
<P>Agreeably al&s;o Bi&s;hop <HI>Williams</HI> (Serm. of <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith</HI>) &mdash; <Q>It is &s;aid here, (Rom. v. 1.) <HI>being ju&s;tified by Faith;</HI> by which we are to under&s;tand, not a mere notional Faith, (for that is no other than an A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of what is reveal|ed) but a Faith in Operation, a Faith ac|tive and vigorous, and that doth compre|hend in it, all that Duty and tho&s;e Gra|ces, which are el&s;e where in Scripture made the Condition of the Go&s;pel Co|venant, and which gives me a Title to all the Benefits of it, &s;uch as Forgivene&s;s of Sin, Adoption and Glorification.

And agreeably the lear|ned Dr. <HI>Jack&s;on, (Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 739. of his Works.) <HI>That good Works (&s;aith he) are more nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation than to Ju&s;tifica|tion, or that they are le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary before Ju|&s;tification, than after it, implies a Contradiction in the Terms well expre&s;&s;ed and equally com|pared.

that accompany it? Suppo&s;e a Man &s;hould die in the very Instant wherein he is justified; none would Doubt either of his Ab&s;olution or Salva|tion.

a Word;</HI> it is neither for your Sake not my own, that I trouble you with this <HI>Fourth</HI> Letter, but for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as may in due Time be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>I have now before me an <HI>anonymous</HI> Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>The Ca&s;e between Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>and Dr.</HI> Stebbing <HI>&s;tated,</HI> &amp;c. containing, or de&s;igned to contain, the <HI>en|tire Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>Methodi&s;t</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Re|generation.</HI> Whether you approve of all and every Thing it contains, I pre&s;ume not to know; but to me it appears as elaborate a Peace of <HI>dogmatical</HI> Theology, as any pro|duc'd in the <HI>Oliverian</HI> Age, and calculated not to edify, but to puzzle and amu&s;e the Minds of the Populace, or common Readers.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Foundation</HI> of this goodly Structure, either the Author mu&s;t beg the Que&s;tion, of the <HI>Propagation of Souls,</HI> or his <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> are mere Amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Either he mu&s;t take for granted, that <HI>A|dam</HI> begat the Souls, as well as Bodies of his immediate Po&s;terity, or who can under&s;tand the <HI>Second</HI> Propo&s;ition? <HI>viz.</HI> Had <HI>Adam</HI> <Q>continued in his happy State, he &s;hould have <HI>tran&s;mitted</HI> to his Po&s;terity, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> that Image of God in which he was made.</Q> Con&s;i&s;ting

The Author dare not &s;ay they can; and if they cannot, then how could <HI>Adam</HI> tran&s;|mit the <HI>Endowments</HI> and Qualities of <HI>Know|ledge, Innocence, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s</HI> to the <HI>Souls</HI> of his Po&s;terity, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> without tran&s;mitting the Sub&s;tance al&s;o?</P>
<P>Again, either the <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t take the &s;ame Principle for granted, or to what End or Purpo&s;e <HI>Prop.</HI> vii and its Comment?</P>
<P>If his Meaning, indeed be, that as every animal Creature, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> begets its like; the Toad, the Viper, the Tyger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> begets Toads, Vipers, Tygers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So the animal Part or Bodies of our fir&s;t Parents being degenerate, corrupt and mortal, the animal Part or Bodies of their Po&s;terity, which alone they could beget, mu&s;t therefore, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> be degenerate, corrupt and mortal al&s;o: If this, I &s;ay, be his Meaning, who will ever di&s;pute the Truth of the Propo&s;ition? Nay&punc;
<PB N="105" REF="004588_0105_100DA67E1A2F7208">
who will not moreover readily grant, that <HI>the corruptible Body pre&s;&s;eth down the Soul,</HI> and often too ea&s;ily be&s;ets and draws it off, from heavenly and &s;piritual to earthly and carnal Things? But then, alas! what o|ther End or Purpo&s;e will all this be of, to the Author's Scheme of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> than to de&s;troy it? This Scheme ab&s;olutely re|quires the po&s;itive <HI>innate</HI> Degeneracy and Corruption of the Soul for its Foundation. And as the <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t plainly &s;ee, that this Degeneracy &amp; Corruption tran&s;mitted from <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>the Laws of Generation,</HI> mu&s;t nece|&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Propagation of Souls;</HI> it is evident to me, that rather than touch this Point, or expre&s;sly beg the Que&s;tion, he cho&s;e to lay its Foundation in Darkne&s;s, and to hide its Weakne&s;s under general and am|biguous Phra&s;es, and e&s;pecially the Word <HI>Nature;</HI> to the no &s;mall Puzzle and Per|plexity of common Readers.</P>
<P>It is true, Mention is once made of a Co|venant <HI>Adam</HI> was under, his being <HI>the Re|pre&s;entative Head,</HI> and of the <HI>Imputation of his Sin;</HI> but as the&s;e, the Author owns, <HI>lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of his Way,</HI> that is, an&s;wered not to his Corruption Scheme, they are once, I &s;ay, as 'twere, compell'd to make a &s;ort of ex|centrick

Appearance, and we hear no more of them.</P>
<P>But to have done with this Head: E|very Body can ea&s;ily conceive, as <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Root,</HI> from which &s;prang the animal Part or Bodies of his Children, that the animal Patt or Bodies of his Children mu&s;t therefore, <HI>by the Laws of Generation,</HI> partake of the Nature and Qualities of that <HI>Root,</HI> whether they were good or evil; but how their Souls, if they &s;prung <HI>not from that Root,</HI> mu&s;t partake of its Nature and Qua|lities, by <HI>any Laws of Generation,</HI> I believe a <HI>Methodist</HI> only can conceive.</P>
<P>The Populace have been &s;trangely amu&s;|ed of late with the <HI>Doctrine of Regeneration,</HI> as a &s;udden, in&s;tantaneous Work (Act) of <HI>the Holy Spirit,</HI> and in which the Subjects are <HI>entirely pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> But this <HI>Author,</HI> tho' he &s;till <HI>dogmatically</HI> in&s;i&s;ts on &s;ome <HI>certain cri|tical Act</HI> in the Ca&s;e, yet has a whole Chap. (4th) concerning the <HI>Manner, Means and Steps,</HI> by which this Work is wrought by the Spirit of God in the Hearts of his Peo|ple. I'm afraid that in this <HI>Chap.</HI> he has departed from <HI>the ancient Te&s;timony,</HI> and ad|vanced &s;everal Things, which natural Men may take <HI>for Incon&s;i&s;tences and Contradictions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="004588_0107_100DA68247123DE0"><HI>Pag.</HI> 52, 53.

<P>How from the Bottom of my Heart do I wi&s;h, that this hone&s;t and in&s;tructive Pa&s;|&s;age &s;tood in <HI>Golden Capitals,</HI> at the Head of every Page, throughout the whole Perfor|mance; with <HI>[Regeneration is the whole and &s;ole Work of God, in which we are entirely pa&s;&s;ive]</HI> incerted between Hooks in the very Center of it; to expo&s;e the Contradiction in direct View, and guard the Judgment of the unwary Reader! The Author goes on, <Q>The&s;e (that is, <HI>Precepts, Admonitions, Promi&s;es, &amp;c.</HI> of the Word all &s;uppo&s;e that we are either capable of doing &s;omething or other in a Way of Duty; or, at lea&s;t, of being <HI>excited, di&s;po&s;ed</HI> and <HI>enabled</HI> to hear, under&s;tand, and do what is required. Tho' we have lo&s;t our In|nocence, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, we have not lo&s;t our Faculties and Powers.

We are not Stocks and Stones, and mere Machines; but, intelligent Agents: And tho' we cannot, in our natural State, know the Things of the Spirit of God, as we &s;hould, and as we mu&s;t, if we would be &s;aved; yet many Things we &s;till know of our Maker, and his Will; yea, and many Things we can al&s;o do. In our Renovation, God re&s;tores what we have lo&s;t, but does it by working upon what remains. He calls and excites us, to the exerci&s;e of our rational Faculties, and at the &s;ame Time cures the Di&s;orders of them, and frames them in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, for what he enjoins. He commands us, for Example, to hear and read his Word, with Reverence and Seriou&s;ne&s;s; and in our obeying, as we can, and hearing it with that Reverence, we would do any Thing of Moment, he makes us to under|&s;tand it. He commands us to mix Faith with our Hearing; and in our receiving it, with that Faith which we may have, he confirms our A&s;&s;ent to it. He &s;aith, Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when we humble our &s;elves under a deep Sen&s;e of our utter Inability, and heartily pray for Almigh|ty

quickning Grace, he by the Power of his Spirit, working with the Word, tho|roughly awakens us, and rai&s;es us from the Dead. He commands Sinners to cea&s;e to do Evil; and in their &s;incere Care to compply, he many Ways a&s;&s;i&s;ts them, And, to learn to do well; and in their &s;etting about this Work, in earne&s;t, he by the Word both di&s;po&s;es them farther, and enables them al&s;o.</Q> Now if all this be <HI>Methodi&s;m,</HI> I &s;ub&s;cribe to it Heart and Hand; only with this Difference from the <HI>Author,</HI> that I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on <HI>the&s;e,</HI> not as <HI>previous Di&s;po&s;itions only,</HI> to the Work of <HI>Regeneration;</HI> but in Reality the Work ado|ing, and part of it actually done.

<P>This, in the Judgment of the Chri&s;tian Church in all Ages, is the plain Doctrine of the Scripture, and therefore the Pa&s;&s;age next following, contains <HI>a Contradiction</HI> to the above cited Pa&s;&s;age, and a manife&s;tly fal&s;e A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We are never com|manded to <HI>regenerate our &s;elves,</HI> or <HI>beget our &s;elves again;</HI> that is God's Work, <HI>his wholly and &s;olely.</HI></Q> But are we indeed ne|ver commanded <HI>to regenerate or beget our &s;elves again;</HI> tho' not in the very Words, (for the Word <HI>Regenerate</HI> occurs not once

<P>ALAS Sir is it come to this at la&s;t!

let the Reader &s;ee the Pa&s;&s;age in this follow|ing Connection (as it ought to have been quo|ted) with his own Eyes. <Q>A divine Reve|lation cannot po&s;&s;ibly be an Argument inducing me to believe the Exi&s;tence of a God, for this plain Rea&s;on; becau&s;e a divine Revelation can be no Argument to any, that is not per&s;uaded that it is a di|vine Revelation: But before I can be per|&s;uaded that any Revelation is from God, I mu&s;t be per&s;uaded there is a God; and if &s;o, there is no Need of this Argument to prove to me there is one. And therefore you do not find it any where revealed in all the Scripture, that there is a God. The Scripture often declares, that <HI>Jeho|vah is the true and living God;</HI> and that, <HI>be&s;ides him there is no other:</HI> But it doth not reveal but every where &s;uppo&s;e, that there is one.</Q> Thus &s;tands the Pa&s;&s;age in Connection, containing as plain and de|mon&s;trable a Truth, as any Propo&s;ition in <HI>Euclid.</HI></P>

wicked Thoughts on the Minds of Men,</HI> (Vol. II. P. 532, 533, <HI>not</HI> 352, 353. as you directed) I mu&s;t beg the <HI>Reader</HI> to con&s;ult that whole <HI>Sermon,</HI> intitled, <HI>the Knowledge of God.</HI> Of the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages relating to this Particular, I &s;hall here &s;et down but this one. &mdash; <HI>I do not &s;ee, how by any Means it can be granted, without Prejudice to this</HI> Prerogative <HI>of God, which the Scripture plain|ly gives him, of being</HI> the only Knower of the Heart, <HI>that the Devil can have &s;o immediate an Acce&s;s to our Minds, as to put wicked Thoughts into them; nor can I think that when it is &s;aid, that</HI> Satan provoked David to Number the People, <HI>that</HI> the Devil entred into <HI>Judas; that</HI> Satan had filled the Heart of <HI>Ananias,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that any or all of the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions do amount to &s;uch an immediate Po|wer, of putting wicked Thoughts into Men's Minds; but they only &s;ignify, that the Devil hath a greater Hand in &s;ome Sins than others; and that a Heart wickedly bent and inclined, gives him a great Advantage to tempt Men more powerfully, by pre&s;enting the Occa&s;ions of &s;uch wicked Thoughts and Actions to them: For it is u&s;ual, in Scripture Phra&s;e, as to a&s;|cribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, &s;o all e|vil Thoughts and Actions to the Devil; not that
<PB N="139" REF="004588_0139_100DA6CA317EAB68">
he is the immediate Cau&s;e of them, but becau&s;e he is always ready to tempt Men to them, and one Way or other to promote them.'</HI> &mdash; Thus every <HI>Reader</HI> may &s;ee, from this Pa&s;&s;age, but more fully from the whole Tenor of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> that the Archbi&s;hop is only a&s;&s;ert|ing <HI>the Knowledge of Men's Hearts</HI> to be the <HI>&s;ole Prerogative</HI> of God, and therefore deny|ing the &s;ame <HI>Prerogative</HI> to the Devil. But the <HI>unparalleled</HI> Abu&s;e of the latter Part of this Pa&s;&s;age by Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and <HI>your&s;elf</HI> his Voucher, mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over in Silence. The lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er Part of this Pa&s;&s;age you cite from Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Preacher, P. 117. Word for Word, thus; &mdash; <HI>As it is u&s;ual, in the Scripture Phra&s;e, to a&s;cribe all good Motions to God's Spirit, &s;o all evil thoughts to the Devil; not that he is the immediate Cau&s;e of the&s;e, no more than God's Spirit is the Au|thor of the other.</HI> Thus Word for Word, I &s;ay, you have cited from Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and all in <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aliks,</HI> as if they all were the Words of the Archbi&s;hop.

And doth not the Framer of it di&s;cover what new Models of Divinity he affects? He is plea&s;ed to excu&s;e the Devil from ejecting any bad Thoughts in|to Men's Minds, and he exempts God's Spirit from being the Cau&s;e or Author of any good or holy Thoughts.</HI> The <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> is &s;trange enough indeed! But whether Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and your <HI>Reverence</HI> are not the <HI>Framers</HI> of it, let the Reader &s;ee. <HI>You,</HI> Sir, and your Brother <HI>Champion</HI> are the <HI>Framers</HI> of it, and as <HI>&s;tupidly as injuriou&s;ly</HI> have you <HI>framed</HI> it. For &s;o far is the Archbi&s;hop from <HI>exemp|ting God's Spirit from being the Author of any good or holy Thoughts,</HI> that it is the whole Scope or Argument of that very Di&s;cour&s;e, to prove it the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Prerogative of God, <HI>to know the Hearts of Men;</HI> and

<P>Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> is now dead and before his Maker, but you are yet alive, and therefore upon you I call, either to <HI>vindi|cate</HI> or <HI>retract</HI> your Te&s;timony in this Matter, in as publick a Manner as you have bore it, or to re&s;t under the Charge of being a <HI>wilful Deciever.</HI></P>

to Chri&s;tianity. Whereas, the Ca&s;e in reality was this.

And there|fore the Clergy after the Re&s;toration, in order to take off tho&s;e unhappy Impre&s;|&s;ions, found them&s;elves obliged to incul|cate with more than ordinary Diligence, the Nece&s;&s;ity of moral Duties in the Chri&s;|tain Life, and to labour to re&s;tore them to their proper Share in the Chri&s;tian Scheme. But tho&s;e of them, who with the hone&s;t View I have mention'd, labour'd the mo&s;t zealou&s;ly in that Way, were at the &s;ame Time as zealous to explain to the People the great Work of our Redemption by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Means of Salvation which God has appointed: <HI>(a)</HI> The Cor|ruption and Mi&s;ery into which Mankind was &s;unk by the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents; <HI>(b)</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity of a Mediator to reco|ver them, and re&s;tore them to the Favour of God; <HI>(c)</HI> The Incarnation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Son of God for that End; <HI>(d)</HI> The Goodne&s;s of God in appointing his own Son to be

More Virulence and Fal&s;ehood cannot be contained in &s;o few Lines. For &s;o far are the generality of Slaves in the&s;e Colonies, from being mi&s;erable, that I dare confident|ly vouch and affirm, and partly on my own Knowledge, that their Lives in gene|ral are more happy and comfortable in all temporal Re&s;pects (the Point of Liberty only excepted) than the Lives of three fourths of the hired <HI>farming</HI> Servants, and Day Labourers, either in <HI>Scotland, Ireland,</HI> or even in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> who not only labour <HI>harder,</HI> and fare <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> but have moreover the Care and Concern on their Minds how to provide for their Fa|milies; which <HI>Slaves</HI> are entirely exemp|ted from, their Children being all provi|ded for at the <HI>Owner</HI>'s Charge.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if this be really the Ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the <HI>generality</HI> of Slaves in the&s;e Colonies, which can fully be proved it is; what <HI>Apology</HI> can &s;uffice either for the Matter or Manner of your Letter, &s;pecially the two mode&s;t <HI>Paragraphs</HI> above mention|ed?

<P>I have a Remedy provided in this Ca&s;e that will bring them by degrees to be true Sons of our Church. The greate&s;t Number of People in every Place never think for them&s;elves, but follow the Man they admire. Your Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et up for uncommon Degrees of Sanctity, make bold Pretences to Illuminations and the Indwelling of the Spirit, and who can contradict you; Ply the&s;e Hereticks with Scripture, fix on that Text <HI>the moral Man exerci&s;eth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him, neither can he know them becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned; but he that is &s;pi|ritual judgeth all Things, and is judged of none.</HI> In&s;i&s;t on it that all who differ from you in their Notions are <HI>carnal Men,</HI> who never felt the Power of Godline&s;s in their own Souls; produce your own Experiences, as the be&s;t Commentaries on the Scriptures, and this will &s;uit your Purpo&s;e as well as our Traditions, and will keep Men from explaining any Text contrary to Experiences of the Godly. The&s;e Hereticks them&s;elves depend on the Spirit? Take a little Advantage of what is natural to their Tempers to expect, and what there is ground for the Righteous to wait for, turn to mechanick Im|pul&s;es and violent Movings, and this will not fail to &s;uit mo&s;t Tempers, pretend that the &s;ame Spirit who in&s;pired the Apo&s;tles is freely be&s;towed on you, and &s;ince natural Men cannot under&s;tand the Scriptures; and you have the Spirit in &s;uch extraordinary Mea&s;ure, you may &s;urely claim the Rights to &s;hew them the true Meaning of the Word, and to think for them in religious Matters, and this will effectually wre&s;t the Bible cut of their Hands who think not as you do, nor receive your Doctrine as the true Mind of God. For if any will dare to oppo&s;e the Sentiments of &s;uch a holy Man, proclaim him an Enemy to God and his Intere&s;t, and &s;et the Mobb on him, and it will pa&s;s for Merrit to make a Sacrifice of &s;uch an Hererick.</P>

If it be rea&s;onable to believe that the Man Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his Body is in the Believer, when he tells us that he is form'd in the Believer, is there not as good ground to conclude, that it is in the con&s;ecrated Wafer, when he &s;ays <HI>this is my Body?</HI> If it be po&s;&s;ible that the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us is
<PB N="156" REF="004588_0156_100DA6F4D7AB3440">
now exalted in Heaven, and at the &s;ame Time is in Thou&s;ands of Believers. Why is it not as ea&s;ily to con|cieve, that he is at once in Heaven and in Thou&s;ands of con&s;ecrated Wafers? But you may po&s;&s;ibly think that it will &s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e the People to imagine that the Prie&s;t by repeating a few Words can convert a piece of Bread in|to the Body of his Redeemer; no my Son, there's no ground for &s;uch fears, you may ea&s;ily bring them to &s;o &s;trong a Faith as to &s;wallow all you Teach them, with|out ever examining it by &s;aying with bold A&s;&s;urance <HI>you &s;peak the Truth in Chri&s;t, and Lie not:</HI> But to make the Thing take more readily, I have a Salve to Cure all. Tell them with a Holy Grimace that the Words which in the other Sacrament, we Tran&s;late Baptizing them <HI>in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> may as well be render'd, Baptizing them <HI>into the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And upon this turn given to the Text, which none mu&s;t venture to Que&s;tion, there is a &s;uffici|ent Foundation laid for this Power which we Claim, and it will effectually &s;upport the Doctrine of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation:</HI> For if the Prie&s;t by Bapti&s;m may change Men who are <HI>by Nature half Bea&s;ts and half Devils,</HI> into the Nature of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, certainly he may with as much ea&s;e by repeating the Words of the In&s;titution in the Lords Supper change a bit of Bread, which is not near &s;o bad as a Devil or a Bea&s;t into the real Body and Blood of Chri&s;t; if the one change can be made in Bapti&s;m; why not the other in the Lords Sup|per? 'Tis as ea&s;y to change a Wafer into Chri&s;ts Body, as a Man into a God, and he that believes the la&s;t, will &s;oon be brought to &s;wollow the fir&s;t.</P>
