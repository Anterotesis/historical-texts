<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION, in &s;ome form or other, &s;eems to have been ob&s;erved by mankind, in all ages and all parts of the world; and con&s;idered as the mo&s;t noble employ|ment, of the mo&s;t divine nature, and producing the mo&s;t bene&s;icial effects to &s;ociety, of all the objects that ever engaged their attention: although from ca&s;ual circum&s;tances, and intere&s;ted motives of individuals, there are as many modes and varieties of wor&s;hip, as languages or nations on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>Europeans have in general embraced chri&s;tianity, as contained in the bible, which <HI>they</HI> call the Word of God, as the only true and infallible &s;y&s;tem on earth, and which only can lead us to eternal happine&s;s. This bible, we have been taught to believe, is holy, ju&s;t, per|fect, and &s;uperior to the human under&s;tanding; &s;o &s;a|cred, that to doubt or di&s;believe it, would entail on us in|evitable never-ending mi&s;ery. This doctrine, being in&s;tilled into children by their nur&s;es; and enforced by terror at a riper age, has long been a&s;&s;ented to by the
<PB N="6" REF="026954_0004_0FD2942F2B9712A8"><HI>generality of people,</HI> who &s;eldom think or inquire for them&s;elves, but are always more or le&s;s the dupes of de&s;igning men.</P>
<P>But the times are now changing; the privilege of rea&s;oning and believing for our&s;elves, begins to be ex|erci&s;ed&mdash;freedom of enquiry abounds; and the natural inherent right of &s;peaking and acting according to the dictates of our own con&s;cience (without injuring &s;ociety) is happily enjoyed. Con&s;equently, impo&s;itions of every kind, &s;uper&s;titious prejudices, and the long wor&s;hipped &s;abrics of civil and religious tyranny, are daily grow|ing into contempt, and in all probability will &s;oon be corn from their foundations, and con&s;igned to that infa|mous oblivion which they &s;o highly merit.</P>
<P>To come more immediately to the point&mdash;the chri&s;ti|an religion, as generally practi&s;ed, pre&s;ents it&s;elf as one of tho&s;e monuments of ignorance and credulity, which the wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent generation is probably de&s;|tined to overthrow, and to &s;ub&s;titute a &s;y&s;tem more &s;im|ple, more pure, and more agreeable to the dictates of rea&s;on. The bible, upon examination, we &s;hall find de|ficient in many of the virtues that have been a&s;cribed to it. As a human compo&s;ition, its merits have been greatly over-rated: it is exceeded in &s;entiment, inven|tion, &s;tile, and every other literary qualification. The ob&s;curity, incredibility and ob&s;cenity, &s;o con&s;picuous in many parts of it, would ju&s;tly condemn the works of a modern writer. It contains a mixture of incon&s;i&s;t|ency and contradiction; to call which the <HI>word of God,</HI> is the highe&s;t pitch of extravagance: it is to attri|bute to the Deity that which any per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e would blu&s;h to confe&s;s him&s;elf the author of.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026954_0005_0FD29430DA64CE30">
How are the rights and dignity of human nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ulted, degraded, and trampled upon! how are mankind blinded, deceived, and led away by this &s;y&s;tem! how is the honor and character of the Almighty affronted by the ab&s;urd and impious doctrines it contains! how is the &s;acred name of God abu&s;ed and pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t and mo&s;t execrable purpo&s;es, by his pretended wor&s;hippers! and all for one &s;imple, evident end, to gratify the pride and avarice of unprincipled, de&s;ign|ing men!</P>
<P>But &s;omething more than declamation is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. I &s;hall therefore give the rea|&s;ons why I di&s;believe the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and all the arguments advanced in its favor.</P>
<P>As to the exi&s;ting proofs of the divine authority of the bible, whether internal or external, whether the evidence we feel in our own minds on examming it, or the miracles which are &s;aid to have attended its propa|gation, they are of no avail in convincing us of its di|vine origin: And I do not think, that independent of the prejudices of education, and the power of eloquence, there ever was a rea&s;onable thinking man, who felt a &s;ufficient internal evidence to convince him of the reality of the whole of its doctrines.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the public proofs exhibited by its founders, we find them no &s;tronger than tho&s;e in fa|vour of Mahometani&s;m, or perhaps any other &s;y&s;tem. Mahomet is &s;aid to have wrought as many miracles, preached as good doctrine, converted ten times as ma|ny followers, and was far more &s;ucce&s;sful in all his en|terprizes, however bold or difficult, than Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The chri&s;tians &s;ay, the Mahometan miracles were no|thing but impo&s;tures; and the Mahometans &s;ay, with
<PB N="8" REF="026954_0006_0FD294355FA7E5A8">as much authority, that the chri&s;tian miracles were the time.</P>
<P>If the go&s;pel &s;y&s;tem was &s;o clear, &s;o rea&s;onable, and &s;o powerful, as its advocates a&s;&s;ert, what nece&s;&s;ity could there have been for miracles to &s;upport it? If it had any foundation in rea&s;on and nature, there would have been no occa&s;ion for my&s;tery, miracle or revelation, to confirm it. A doctrine that is rea&s;onable and true, will appear &s;o to every unprejudiced mind, without the aid of any thing &s;upernatural. Con&s;equently, that &s;y&s;tem which requires miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and cannot be proved by human means, is neither rea&s;onable nor true.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the bible to have been written by divine in&s;piration, at the times, and by the per&s;ons mention|ed in it, &s;till it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that it could have been tran&s;mitted down to the pre&s;ent time pure and un|contaminated, even if there had been but one nation and one language upon earth. The variety of tran&s;la|tions and editions it has pa&s;&s;ed through in the cour&s;e of near eighteen hundred years, if it has exi&s;ted &s;o long, (which I am inclined to di&s;believe of many parts) and the continual improvements and alterations in human language, during that period, amount to a pre&s;ump|tive proof that the &s;en&s;e has been unavoidably mi&s;|taken, or wilfully perverted. A confirmation of this remark is open to all: Let any one take the trouble of comparing different cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the bible, printed in the la&s;t and pre&s;ent centuries, or even in the &s;ame year, and he will often find a &s;triking di&s;agreement.</P>
<P>Admitting that the bible contains the only doctrine by which we can obtain &s;alvation and everla&s;ting life, which of the numberle&s;s profe&s;&s;ions that have &s;prung
<PB N="9" REF="026954_0007_0FD29437158F1E88">out of it are we to embrace? One &s;ect tells us that there is no &s;alvation out of the pale of their church. Ano|ther tells us, that unle&s;s we believe and practi&s;e their doctrines, we &s;hall &s;urely be damned. Let us believe therefore, in whatever particular profe&s;&s;ion we may, we &s;hall be damned according to the principles of the others.</P>
<P>How gracious and beneficent is the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem! &s;o perfect and pure that it creates &s;o many different, di&s;tinct, and oppo&s;ite denominations of believers; all of them right, infallibly right, in their own opinions, and proving their doctrine by the clear, inconte&s;tible authority of divine revelation!</P>
<P>Many, as an excu&s;e for countenancing a doctrine which they confe&s;s may not be true, &s;ay, that if the chri&s;tian religion be fal&s;e, it is &s;till very hurtful to at|tempt to overturn it; as we have no better guide, and no other method to re&s;train the pa&s;&s;ions and regulate the conduct of mankind; as it is the mo&s;t perfect and be|neficial &s;y&s;tem that could be devi&s;ed. To determine this, we mu&s;t look at its effects.</P>
<P>That doctrine which has the greate&s;t tendency to &s;e|cure our pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s, is the be&s;t; it proves it&s;elf to be &s;o. That the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem does not tend to make us happier, may ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, by tracing its natural operations on the human mind. By it we are led to believe, that we are all mi&s;erable and ruined wretches; corrupt and exceedingly wicked from our very birth; naturally &s;inful, and oppo&s;ed to the will of God in all our actions, words and thoughts; and &s;o far from de&s;erving the common ble&s;&s;ings of life, that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tice had been done us, we &s;hould long &s;ince have been ca&s;t into endle&s;s puni&s;hment. Tribulation,
<PB N="10" REF="026954_0008_0FD2943850DC3150">di&s;ite&s;s and &s;ore trials, are the common lot of man|kind, e&s;pecially the good. "Whom the Lord loveth be chadeneth." This world, it tells us, is a wretched, tire&s;ome and accur&s;ed place; a mere &s;ink of guilt and mi&s;ery; and all its enjoyments vanity and vexation of &s;pirit. Though by the bye, tho&s;e who are called &s;incere and pious chri&s;tians &s;eem to be as de&s;irous of continu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in it, and ta&s;ting the good things it affords, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and worldly-minded &s;inner. It likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> its followers &s;uch a &s;ervile fear, and dread of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th of heaven, that they can neither lie down as night, nor ri&s;e in the morning, without fir&s;t attempt|ing, by entreaty, flattery and fair promi&s;es, to appea&s;e the Divine anger, and per&s;uade the Almighty to per|mit them to exi&s;t in peace. Every accident is a judg|ment, and a prelude to further puni&s;hment. Every misfortune that happens to their neighbours is a warn|ing to them; and they are liable every moment to be cut off by an avenging God, and &s;ent to Hell.</P>
<P>While on the one hand, they repre&s;ent the Deity as then &s;ervant, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them on every occa&s;ion, avert|ing every ill they bring upon them&s;elves, and ex|tricating them from every difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s they plunge them&s;elves into. On the other, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a fierce, revengeful tyrant, delighting in cruelty, puni&s;hing his creatures for the very &s;ins which he cau&s;es them to commit; and creating numberle&s;s millions of immortal &s;ouls, that could never have offended him, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of tormenting them to all eternity. Thus they are generally mi&s;erable through life, in me|ditating on death and its &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The authority of the bible appears &s;till more doubt|ful from the ab&s;urdities and contradictions it contains;
<PB N="11" REF="026954_0009_0FD29439D2CC60C0">contradictions which all the &s;ophi&s;tical ingenuity of re|verend divines, with their literal meaning of this text, and &s;piritual interpretation of that, can never explain or reconcile.</P>
<P>In the very fir&s;t chapter of the whole volume, con|taining an account of the creation, we find an inexpli|cable difficulty. In Gene&s;is i. 27, 28. we are told, that "God created man, <HI>male and &s;emale,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>them,</HI> and &s;aid unto <HI>them,</HI>" &amp;c. But in ii. 20. we find that "there was not an help meet for Adam:" therefore, ver. 18. "God &s;aid, it is not good that man &s;hould be alone." And, ver. 22. "he made a woman, and brought her unto the man."</P>
<P>The Almighty, according to many parts of the bi|ble, is a perfect, unchangeable being. In I&s;aiah, he is &s;aid to declare, that he is "not as a man, that he &s;hould repent." But in other places we read of his re|penting very frequently. He repented that he had made man. Having determined to de&s;troy the I&s;rael|ites, and having &s;lain &s;eventy thou&s;and of them, he "repent|ed of the evil," and &s;pared the re&s;t. He told Hezekiah that "he &s;hould &s;urely die, and not live;" but imme|diately repented, and gave him fifteen years longer. Jonah prophe&s;ied, in his name, that in forty days Nine|veh &s;hould be overthrown; but the people believing him (though he did not perform his promi&s;e) and for|&s;aking their &s;ins, he "repented of the evil that he &s;aid he would do unto them, and did it not."</P>
<P>In one place it &s;ays, "Our God is a con&s;uming fire;" and in another, "God is love." He is &s;aid to be jea|lous, revengeful and angry with the wicked every day; and plea&s;ed again as often at they repent: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="12" REF="026954_0010_0FD2943B50E4E7C8">all the good and evil qualities of man, that un&s;table, wicked, mi&s;erable, and in&s;ignificant worm. Notwith|&s;tanding all this, he is perfectly ju&s;t, wi&s;e, immutable, and can never repent.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, I venture to affirm, has been the cau&s;e of more evil in the world, man any other that ever appeared in it. By inculcating a belief that the Deity was a terrible God, an inexer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able judge, taking vengeance on all his enemies; its profe&s;&s;ors, wi&s;hing to conform as much as po&s;&s;ible to the character and di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>their God,</HI> have in all ages acted with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and upon the &s;ame principles:
<Q><L>"O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>&s;trong, unerring</HI> hand,</L>
<L>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny bolts <HI>forever</HI> throw;</L>
<L>And deal da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ation round the land,</L>
<L>On each I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udge thy foe."</L></Q></P>
<P>In&s;pired with the mo&s;t vindictive hatred to all who do not &s;ub&s;cribe to the principles they profe&s;s (who are, according to their faith, enemies; for they &s;ay, there is no medium or neutrality, "all who are not for us are again&s;t us:") they have never fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, in any country, and at all times, when they had the power, to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t cruel and dete&s;table &s;pirit that ever di&s;graced human nature. Not contented with in&s;ult|ing, oppre&s;&s;ing, en&s;laving and butchering the poor heretics here, but mo&s;t humanely and charitably con|demning them to everla&s;ting torments hereafter.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t 320 years of its exi&s;tence, chri&s;tiani|ty occa&s;ioned the de&s;truction of many millions of man|kind. In the fir&s;t part of this period, the chri&s;tians were the greate&s;t &s;ufferers; but in the year 312 Max|entius and his army of 200,000, were mo&s;t of them
<PB N="13" REF="026954_0011_0FD2943F93619BE0">drowned in the Tiber, or &s;lain by Con&s;tautine, the chri&s;tian emperor; who, in three great battles, in one of which 100,000 were killed, reduced and put to death Licinus, the deputy emperor of the Ea&s;t; per&s;ecuted the Heathens and de&s;troyed their idols, the &s;ymbols of their divinities.</P>
<P>In the twelfth and &s;ub&s;equent centuries, millions of Walden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prote&s;tants were murdered in the &s;outh of France. How many millions lo&s;t their lives in the mad cru&s;ades for the recovery of the Holy Land! In Germany and Flanders, in England, Scotland and Ireland, in South America&mdash;But I &s;top, or "I could a tale unfold, who&s;e lighte&s;t word would harrow up the &s;oul," chill the blood with horror, and draw forth cur&s;es from the grave again&s;t the very name of a reli|gion which has been made the pretext for &s;uch cruelties.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate the mi&s;chief that has attended the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem &s;ince its commence|ment. But, &s;ay its advocates, all this was done by an|tichri&s;t, or the fal&s;e church. Which then is the true church? Not that which per&s;ecutes. And what church is that? The church of Rome? No: For that, after long &s;truggles, no &s;ooner became e&s;tabli&s;hed in power, than it per&s;ecuted its di&s;&s;enting &s;ons with all the zeal and barbarity that it had experienced from its enemies. The church of England? No: For although that &s;epa|rated from the church of Rome, and rejected many of the errors and corruptions which had crept into it; yet no &s;ooner was it fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great-Britain, than it very carefully trod over the &s;teps of the mother-church, per&s;ecuted Roman catholics, and all di&s;&s;enters. The puritans who fled to this country for the &s;ake of freedom of con&s;cience and religious liberty, were no
<PB N="14" REF="026954_0012_0FD294423B44BEA8">&s;ooner &s;ettled than they di&s;covered the &s;ame illiberal per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, which drove them hither, and per&s;e|cuted the Quakers in their turn; becoming as corrupt as any of the former churches. Each of them, while they were weak and defencele&s;s, &s;uffered by the mur|derous hand of its oppre&s;&s;ors; and, when become &s;trong and powerful, per&s;ecuted and martyred its feebler ene|mies. And I believe there is not a church in Chri&s;ten|dom but would, if it could not convert, mo&s;t gladly de&s;troy all its oppo&s;ers; had it that one e&s;&s;ential and only nece&s;&s;ary quality, <HI>power.</HI> For they affirm, that the world, with all its ble&s;&s;ings, are nothing but tempta|tions to draw them away from their true intere&s;t; and that unbelievers of every kind are their natural im|placable enemies.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arnal mind, &s;ay they, is enmity to God and his people (them&s;elves) and is in continual oppo&s;ition to every thing good and heavenly; they mu&s;t then of nece&s;&s;ity wage an eternal war again&s;t all who do not acknowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their &s;y&s;tem, as the only &s;ure guide to heaven.</P>
<P>The powerful blow which has been aimed at this &s;y&s;tem of faith by P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine's Age of Rea&s;on, has created a general and well-founded alarm. That work, to every bigotted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> intere&s;ted follower of chri&s;tianity, ap|pears in a dreadful light indeed; as it is a direct attack upon their favorite, their dearly beloved &s;y&s;tem of go&s;|pel faith, which exalts them, in their own opinions, &s;o much above the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian theology <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o favorable to the pride and vanity of man, that the &s;lighte&s;t attempt to over|turn it, occa&s;ions an univer&s;al panic in its &s;upporters, who immediately di&s;play all the en&s;igns of their cau&s;e,
<PB N="15" REF="026954_0013_0FD29443977A73C8">the pompous, high-&s;ounding anathemas of &s;cripture, to frighten the bold invader of their aerial territories.&mdash; So far they act con&s;i&s;tently; for where they have no weapons or defence from nature and rea&s;on, fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r and hope, though unfounded and delu&s;ive, are the only ex|pedients left. By repre&s;enting the terrors of their law in the mo&s;t horrid colours, the wretched victim of their de&s;igns cries out in the depth of de&s;pair, "<HI>Lord,</HI> what &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?" The work is then in a certain way of &s;ucce&s;s; the convert gives him&s;elf up to the di|rection of the church in all things, and is ever after the pa&s;&s;ive tool of its power. The&s;e converts are &s;el|dom or never made by pure rea&s;on and &s;ound argu|ment; for the&s;e would never an&s;wer the purpo&s;e: but the pa&s;&s;ions, which may be driven by every gale that blows, the fickle and incon&s;tant pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o influen|ced by the power of fal&s;e eloquence in violent declama|tions and vehement harrangues, that the calm, even voice of rea&s;on is not heard, or is di&s;regarded, amid&s;t the bu&s;tle of jarring emotions; and the poor frightened wretch catches hold of the fir&s;t object that is held out to &s;ave him from his fancied peri&s;hing and undone con|dition. Without ever once con&s;idering whether the pro|fe&s;&s;ion they embrace is founded in nature and rea&s;on, they confide wholly in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty of their &s;piritual teach|er, leave their faith and hope altogether in his hands, and tru&s;t entirely upon his promi&s;es and power.

<P>In fact, the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem has never yet been weigh|ed in the imparti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of rea&s;on, or received a can|did trial in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> world. Force, fraud, and
<PB N="16" REF="026954_0014_0FD29445505CC438">other unfair means have always been nece&s;&s;arily em|ployed for its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Had it been founded on truth, or con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e, its advocates would never have refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit it to rea&s;on, and the cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment of mankind. But they well knew that it could never&s;tand the te&s;t, and this would be the certain means of its de&s;truction. They there|fore boldly and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly tell the world, that it is beyond the reach of human rea&s;on, which is not com|petent to judge rightly of it. They confe&s;s that we can|not comprehend a great part of it; but at the &s;ame time command us to believe it, though we cannot under|&s;tand it.</P>
<P>It has been the peculiarly honorable lot of Thomas Paine, the firm advocate of truth, the undaunted cham|pion of rea&s;on, and the re&s;olute and unconquerable enemy of tyranny, bigotry and prejudice, to open the door to free and impartial enquiry. He has bold|ly entered the field him&s;elf, and taught the world, that no true &s;y&s;tem of principles, however &s;acred they may be held in the public opinion, and however &s;trongly protected and enforced by the terrors of man's ven|geance here, and eternal puni&s;hment hereafter, is too awful to be canva&s;&s;ed by rea&s;on, or too &s;ublime to be comprehended by common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as it is not con&s;i&s;tent with rea|&s;on, is declared to be above it; and &s;hould be received even if it does not appear clear and intelligible to our human capacities.</P>
<P>This by prohibiting enquiry, effectually prevents de|tection of fal&s;ehood and confirmation of truth. The doctrine is received upon tru&s;t, upon the credit of our forefathers; becau&s;e they taught, or rather &s;aid &s;o, we
<PB N="17" REF="026954_0015_0FD29449D8F49C60">mu&s;t implicitly believe &s;o, all the remon&s;trances of rea|&s;on and experience to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>This is certainly a very great ab&s;urdity. For there once was a beginning to every &s;y&s;tem or theory in be|ing; and at that beginning it was nece&s;&s;ary to exerci&s;e rea&s;on as the unerring guide to direct in the choice or rejection thereof. If mankind were not only allowed, but nece&s;&s;itated to weigh every doctrine in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">falli|ble balance of rea&s;on, at any time, why are we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot en|titled to the &s;ame privilege at pre&s;ent? Is our rea&s;on degenerated? Are our faculties impaired? Or rather are we not far more wi&s;e and enlightened than mankind were centuries ago, and much more competent to un|der&s;tand and judge of things than they were? By the practice before mentioned, by that tyranny over the minds of men, which has ever been exerci&s;ed in de&s;po|tic &s;tates, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;hoods have been forced upon the world for realities, and the mo&s;t dete&s;table impo&s;i|tions e&s;tabli&s;hed and maintained in all the &s;trength and vigour of immutable truth.</P>
<P>But the&s;e arts, how long &s;oever they may pro&s;per, and by whatever authority they may be &s;upported; though they may call to their aid all the powers of &s;u|per&s;tition and prejudices of education, and be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pride and deceit of hypocritical bygots and merce|nary tyrants; &s;till mu&s;t they finally fall, and &s;ink into contemptuous oblivion. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety &s;eems peculiarly adapted to the advancement of truth, and de&s;truction of error. The &s;un of rea&s;on has begun to appear, di&s;pelling the thick and almo&s;t impenetrable mi&s;ts of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, illuminating the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the mind, and will continue to en|crea&s;e in &s;plendor, till it &s;hine forth in one clear, un|clouded and eternal day.</P>

<P>From an attentive peru&s;al of &s;uch liberal, enlighten|ed writers as Pope, Locke, Hume, &amp;c. who were not intere&s;ted in forcing any unnatural &s;y&s;tems upon man|kind, who&s;e only aim was the happine&s;s of the human race, and from my own reflections, I have adopted the following <HI>creed,</HI> which I here &s;ubmit to the impartial con&s;ideration of my fellow-citizens of all denominations.</P>
<P N="1">1. I believe in one God, or fir&s;t cau&s;e, wi&s;e, powerful and good; and too far above the influence of human actions to be affected by any thing that can be done on earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. I believe in the equality of men by nature (though &s;o different by accident) the univer&s;al power of con|&s;cience, and the unerring authority of natural rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">3. I believe the whole duty of man is compri&s;ed in this one great republican principle&mdash;do ju&s;t as you would be done unto.&mdash;My rea&s;ons for believing thus are, in the fir&s;t place, that this fir&s;t cau&s;e is wi&s;e and powerful beyond our conception, is clearly evinced in the wonderful formation and di&s;po&s;ition of nature, ex|hibited in every thing that we have any perception of. That he is good, the whole creation proves; for we find nothing made but what is u&s;eful, beneficial, and conducive to the happine&s;s of the whole. And that he is too far above the reach of human actions to be af|fected
<PB N="20" REF="026954_0018_0FD2944ECA2146E8">by any thing that can be done on earth, is infer|red from nature, rea&s;on and experience: for the only idea that we can form of the Deity is, that he is a per|fect, unchangeable being; and if we &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;o particularly notices the conduct of mankind as to be dif|ferently affected by their different actions, we mu&s;t al|low that he is an imperfect, changeable being, liable to be plea&s;ed or vexed at the mere will and plea&s;ure of his creatures, and dependent upon the whim and caprice of <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, it appears from the experi|ence of mankind in all ages, that Nature, in the crea|tion of man, acts impartially and equally; but leaves his talents, di&s;po&s;ition, &amp;c. to be regulated by mere ac|cidental circum&s;tances. That con&s;cience has an uni|ver&s;al power, is evident from the di&s;like and abhor|rence, with which all mankind look upon actions that tend to the injury of &s;ociety. And not to believe in the unerring authority of natural rea&s;on, would be to ac|cu&s;e the Deity of inju&s;tice for not creating us capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing good from evil, and then puni&s;hing us for the evil we commit.</P>
<P>In the third place, that the whole duty of man is compri&s;ed in this one great republican principle, "Do as you would be done unto," has appeared &s;o notori|ous to the world in all ages, that it has been univer&s;al|ly agreed upon, as the unerring rule of action, and the ba&s;is of happine&s;s: by the ob&s;erving of which there can be neither oppre&s;&s;ion, deceit, or inju&s;tice of any kind. The duty of man is his intere&s;t; his intere&s;t is to make him&s;elf happy; and the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t way of doing this is to promote the pro&s;perity of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="026954_0019_0FD294508718BDF0">
Finally, that &s;y&s;tem of religion which contradicts it|&s;elf, cannot be wholly true.&mdash;That which is not con&s;i&s;t|ent with rea&s;on, or agreeable to the order of nature, mu&s;t be fal&s;e, as different from the will of the Deity, di&s;played in all his works:&mdash;And, that which tends to promote di&s;cord, pride and deceit, is prejudicial to &s;o|ciety, and ought to be di&s;countenanced and oppo&s;ed by every good man.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE PUBLICATIONS WHICH HAVE APPEARED IN OPPOSITION TO THE AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t attack, the author very wi&s;ely entitled "The Folly of Rea&s;on," which, as the title indicates, is a mere catch-penny performance, and was probably written from no other than mercenary views: argument and rea&s;on are rejected, and declamation and bare a&s;&s;er|tion &s;ub&s;tituted in their place.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the real merit of the piece, it would be an in&s;ult on common &s;en&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e it worthy a &s;e|rious con&s;ideration. But as the advocates of the doc|trine it attempts to &s;upport are in &s;uch need of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, that they eagerly catch at every appearance of rea&s;on or argument in their favor, and deceive them|&s;elves with the idea of importance in that which really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es none; &s;ome remarks, to remove the feeble im|pre&s;&s;ions made by this pamphlet, and &s;hew the ab&s;urd|ity
<PB N="23" REF="026954_0021_0FD2945716A4AD38">of the principles it is intended to e&s;tabli&s;h, may there|fore not be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The ludicrous ab&s;urdity of the title, is &s;o evident to every reader of common &s;en&s;e, that I &s;hall not in&s;ult his under&s;tanding by commenting upon it. It is, how|ever, very curious, that the author &s;hould attempt, by the power of <HI>his &s;hare of rea&s;on,</HI> to prove the folly and in&s;ufficiency of <HI>all rea&s;on.</HI> If rea&s;on, as he a&s;&s;erts, is weak and deceitful, it is what I never &s;u&s;pected before; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, he goes as far to prove it, not by <HI>argument,</HI> but <HI>example,</HI> as any writer I ever met with.</P>
<P>The <HI>"bigotry of a dei&s;t,"</HI> which he mentions in his fir&s;t &s;entence, is an entire new expre&s;&s;ion; and as it is an incon&s;i&s;tent one, it cannot apply to Mr. Paine or any one el&s;e. Bigotry &s;ignifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anatici&s;m, blind zeal or &s;uper&s;tition; of which neither Mr. Paine, nor any other dei&s;t can be accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the next &s;entence he ob&s;erves, "To, doubt the truth of the &s;criptures at this day is truly alarming." I cannot &s;ee why it &s;hould be alarming at this or any other day, or that it is alarming or dangerous at all: for we know that there is now, and always have been, men of the greate&s;t eminence, who have both doubted and denied the truth of them, and that without any evil con&s;equences following. The author proceeds, "A jargon of logic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing upon the pa&s;&s;ions, not the rea&s;on of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">onfe&s;s is calculated more to draw them from the practice of every moral duty, than to in&s;tilinto their minds either morality or brotherly love." <HI>A gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gic, playing upon the pa&s;&s;ions, not the rea&s;on of men,</HI> never did o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could exi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, but in his imagination &mdash;another newly coined expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="026954_0022_0FD294589D92D0E8">
As for the &s;ucceeding paragraphs, to page 11, they either mean nothing, or their meaning is unknown to any but the writer: we will therefore pa&s;s on to take notice of what he intends as arguments to prove the truth of the bible, from page 11 to 20. His fir&s;t ob&s;erva|tion is, that "The marks and tokens whereby to judge at all times of the truth of a revelation, is the credibi|lity of the per&s;on who brings it." On the contrary, the only marks to judge of the truth of a &s;tory are, the credibility and rea&s;onablene&s;s of the matter, and the evi|dences brought to prove it.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, "That God would &s;uffer a book that pre|tends to &s;uch marks of truth and authority, to make its way &s;o long, &amp;c. is not only highly impropable, but in the nature of the thing, plainly impo&s;&s;ible." But <HI>I &s;ay</HI> it is both probable and po&s;&s;ible. For has not the Turki&s;h Alcoran, which the chri&s;tians affirm to be fal&s;e and wicked, exi&s;ted for a time nearly as long as our bible; notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition it met with, and in &s;pite of all the power and policy of chri&s;tendom; &s;o that it is now as fully believed and more uniformly adheared to than the chri&s;tian faith?</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts, that "the bible contains nothing poor, mean, or &s;uperfluous." If, as he attempts to prove, rea&s;on is incompetent to determine the matter, he has no right to make the a&s;&s;ertion. At any rate, he has no more authority for &s;aying this, than I have for &s;aying the contrary. And had the author been endowed with a common &s;hare of under&s;tanding, he would have been convinced that it contain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much poorne&s;s, meanne&s;s, and &s;uperfluity: that there are many parts of it highly indecent, perfectly ob&s;cene, and by their ob&s;curity and unintelligibility truly &s;uperfluous. Many chapters in
<PB N="25" REF="026954_0023_0FD2945A0D755BB8">the bible, by being read in churches, have rai&s;ed the blu&s;h of mode&s;ty on the cheek of innocence; &s;hamed the virtuous matron, and di&s;gu&s;ted every man of &s;en&s;e and decency. I could point out many pa&s;&s;ages which no rea&s;onable parent would &s;uffer his children to read, and which if contained in any other book, would bani&s;h it from poli&s;hed &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Page 20. "Now it is ju&s;t the &s;ame in the choice of religion, as in the choice of a condition of life." In one &s;en&s;e, this is perfectly true: for of the great varie|ty of conditions in human life, it is &s;ometimes very dif|ficult to determine which would be the be&s;t for an indi|vidual to adopt. And in religion, there being an almo&s;t innumerable number of different &s;ects, each one declar|ing it&s;elf to be &s;uperior to all the re&s;t; it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover which we ought to embrace as the mo&s;t excel|lent.&mdash;That we mu&s;t be &s;olely directed by rea&s;on in the choice of a condition in life, I believe no per&s;on will pretend to deny. If, then, as our author a&s;&s;erts, the ca&s;es are exactly &s;imilar, we mu&s;t al&s;o be guided by rea|&s;on in the choice of a religion.</P>
<P>WE now come to the "<HI>Examination</HI> of the Age of Rea&s;on, by <HI>Gilbert Wakefield,</HI> late Fellow of Je&s;us Col|lege; which, we are led to &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t be a powerful and unan&s;werable refutation of Mr. Paine's work, &s;ince the author received his education at Cambridge Uni|ver&s;ity, and in <HI>Je&s;us</HI> College; and if we may credit what he intimates in the motto, one who has "drank deep of the Pierian &s;pring;" while Mr. Paine has only taken "&s;hallow draughts."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="026954_0024_0FD294600A853108">
He begins his "Examination" with an encomium on Mr. Paine and his writings, and, after allowing <HI>the Age of Rea&s;on</HI> that merit which he or any other new-fan|gled reformer cannot deprive it of, informs us what were his motives for combating &s;o great a writer.</P>
<P>In pages 6 and 7, he ob&s;erves, "the time is come when all our opinions mu&s;t be tried at the touch-&s;tone of &s;evere enquiry; and, if the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian reve|lations cannot &s;upport them&s;elves again&s;t the batteries of their a&s;&s;ailants, in the e&s;timation of capable and di&s;|intere&s;ted judges, the out-po&s;ts mu&s;t be abandoned, and a retreat &s;ecured to the fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> already oc|cupied by the patriarchs of old, and the illu&s;trious philo|&s;ophres of later times." I confe&s;s it is a proof of his can|dor when he calls the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian revelations only <HI>out-po&s;ts,</HI> while he acknowledges Dei&s;m as the <HI>fortre&s;s,</HI> occupied by the <HI>patriarchs of old,</HI> and the <HI>illu&s;trious phi|lo&s;ophers</HI> of later times; though it is not much in favor of the cau&s;e he is engaged in, but rather a good argu|ment again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the patriarchs of old, I under&s;tand the ancient fa|thers, or heads of families, tribes and nations, wi&s;e and experienced men, honorable and upright judges of the land. If Dei&s;m was the fortre&s;s which they oc|cupied, as the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and ju&s;t foundation on which to place their confidence, in oppo&s;ition to the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian revelations, which were believed principally by the mean and ignorant&mdash;it is certainly a very &s;trong rea&s;on why we &s;hould withhold our belief from it, at lea&s;t untill we are convinced of its truth by our own rea&s;on; and if the illu&s;trious philo&s;ophers of later times, who mu&s;t be allowed to be the mo&s;t learn|ed, and unprejudiced of mankind; and who, it is pre|&s;umed,
<PB N="27" REF="026954_0025_0FD294618EBD4120">would not adopt any &s;y&s;tem of &s;uch magnitude without the mo&s;t mature deliberation and perfect &s;atis|faction thereon; if the&s;e men preferred the principles of Dei&s;m to the doctrines or revealed religion, it is a con|&s;ideration which ought to &s;ink deep in every thinking mind, particularly when we reflect that the&s;e philo&s;o|phers, free from the influence of vulgar prejudices and popular opinions, had the advantage of all the writings which preceded them, on which to found their opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. Wakefield &s;eems to be confident that the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian revelations are pefectly con&s;i&s;tent with each other, and that no per&s;on can acknowledge the authority of the one without believing in the other.&mdash; But if he will take the trouble of reading David Levy's an&s;wer to Dr. Prie&s;tly's letters to the Jews, he will find that they do not <HI>quite</HI> agree with each other; which would mo&s;t certainly be the ca&s;e, if they were both the words of an unchangeable God. In fact, Mr. Levy makes it appear evident, that the two te&s;taments or covenants, are not only incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, but are &s;o notoriou&s;ly contradictory, that they cannot both be true. Our author him&s;elf has not by far &s;o firm a belief in the old te&s;tament as in the new; indeed, &s;ome of the miraculous &s;tories in it he di&s;credits entire|ly; but according to Levy, he ought to believe every part of the old, and con&s;ider the new only as an appen|dix or confirmation of it.</P>
<P>He &s;hortly after ob&s;erves, "The creed of chri&s;tian churches, which acknowledges Je&s;us Chri&s;t al&s;o to be God, and the Holy Gho&s;t to be God, is a fundamental violation of all theology; a doctrine alike unknown to the Heathens and Jews, and contemplated with abhor|rence by the followers of Mo&s;es from its fir&s;t propaga|tion
<PB N="28" REF="026954_0026_0FD2946309091088">to this very day: a doctrine, incon&s;i&s;tent with the plaine&s;t declarations of Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his apo&s;tles; a doctrine, which no human te&s;timony whatever could render credible; a doctrine, which will happily prove a mill-&s;tone to all political e&s;tabli&s;hments of chri&s;tianity." All this may be allowed to be true, excepting that it is <HI>a doctrine, incon&s;i&s;tent with the plaine&s;t declarations of the apo&s;tles;</HI> for we find the Godhead of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;trict|ly agreeable to &s;cripture, according to the writings of the apo&s;tles. Which belief is adopted as the foundation of almo&s;t every church in Chri&s;tendom. He mu&s;t then admit that article as con&s;i&s;tent with &s;cripture, or reject tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which contain it: and if he rejects one part which he does not believe, why may not all the world likewi&s;e refu&s;e their a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e parts which they cannot comprehend or believe? Or has he the &s;ole privilege of adopting and rejecting whatever portion of the bible he may think proper? The doctrine of the Trinity is certainly found in the chri&s;tian revelation; and as it is a fundamental article of their faith, if fal&s;e, it mu&s;t overturn the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The next article of Mr. Paine's creed, our author proceeds, in pages 8 and 9, to corroborate and con|firm, by &s;ome judicious and ju&s;t remarks on <HI>civil privi|leges</HI> and <HI>titular di&s;tinctions;</HI> in which he contradicts the doctrine of that infinite inequality among mankind, prede&s;tinated from eternity, &s;o often repeated in &s;crip|ture, &s;aps the foundation of the chri&s;tian religion, and &s;trengthens our di&s;belief of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding article of Mr. Paine's belief, or ra|ther di&s;belief, he likewi&s;e confirms, and calls the <HI>Atha|ma&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Nicene</HI> creeds, a "mon&s;trous farrago of ab|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urdities and contradictions;" declaring that "&s;ome
<PB N="29" REF="026954_0027_0FD294649894A210">articles of the <HI>Apo&s;tles'</HI> creed, which may be found in the liturgies of e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, are certainly not written in the book of life." In this we agree with him; although we do not &s;uppo&s;e that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that perfect and true knowledge of the doctrines contained in the &s;criptures, which can render him capable of re|moving all the doubts, reconciling all the contradic|tions, and explaining all the difficulties we find in it.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, generally hold, that if we reject one part of the bible, we mu&s;t the whole; for it is all of equal authority and importance: And if our author refu&s;es his con&s;ent to the doctrines of the Trinity, prede&s;tination, &amp;c. which it certainly contains, he mu&s;t con&s;equently doubt of the whole; or believe only &s;uch parts as his intere&s;t or opinion may incline him. To this privilege he is no more entitled than any other man. And if every one has a right, as he undoubtedly has, of not believing any part which appears doubtful to him, the whole bible, at lea&s;t the doctrinal part of it, may appear fal&s;e or dubious to different per&s;ons, and its credit be thereby entirely de&s;troyed; leaving it a matter of indifference to every one to believe or di&s;believe as he may think mo&s;t to his advantage.</P>
<P>The remainder of this and the following page, contains farthen quotations from Mr. Paine, illu&s;trated and en|forced with much more good &s;en&s;e and liberality than is to be found in the remainder of the work; giving him credit for ju&s;tne&s;s of remark, conci&s;ene&s;s and preg|nancy of expre&s;&s;ion, manly &s;en&s;e, dignified morality, and &s;imple, but energetic language. Indeed, &s;o far it
<PB N="30" REF="026954_0028_0FD29468B3D3C2E0">&s;eems to have been intended as the elougium of an en|raptured friend, rather than the efforts of a violent and conceited adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>But he can confine him&s;elf to propriety and candor no longer; and we accordingly find him, in page 13, breaking out into the mo&s;t pointed and ill-founded op|po&s;ition. He a&s;&s;erts, that "the &s;y&s;tem of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the way of God is open to every man alike; as might be proved by ma|ny pa&s;&s;ages of the chri&s;tian &s;criptures." That this can be proved by them, in a certain degree, may be true; as they can be brought to prove, if their au|thority is good, almo&s;t any notion that ever entered the imagination of man. But we find them declaring, "that there is no other name under heaven, by which a man can be &s;aved, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t." How this leaves the way of God open to every man alike, I can|not conceive; for it expre&s;sly lays this down as the on|ly way, and prohibits our ever enjoying &s;piritual, or even temporal happine&s;s in any other.</P>
<P>In the next &s;entence, he adds, "What the Jews and Chri&s;tians maintain in behalf of their religious &s;y&s;tems is that their founders delivered to mankind rational &s;entiments of the divine nature, of his exi&s;tence, and his providential government of the world." This &s;tatement, to u&s;e his own language, is frivolous and erroneous in the extreme: for their &s;entiments of the exi&s;tence of the divine nature, and his government of the world, are not only very ab&s;urd and incon&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tent with rea&s;on, but a great part of them couched in my&s;|terious and unintelligible terms, and incomprehen&s;i|ble, on their own principles, by any who are not im|mediately in&s;pired from Heaven. Indeed, they de|clare
<PB N="31" REF="026954_0029_0FD2946C7A4C1668">them to be beyond the reach of human rea&s;on; the wi&s;dom of the world, &s;ay they, is fooli&s;hne&s;s to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and the prophets.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to his long &s;tring of indubitable po&s;itions, as he calls them, concerning the antiquity and excellence of the writings of the Jews, little need be &s;aid. For we can|not be convinced that they were written at the times and by the per&s;ons which they are &s;aid to be. The book of Job, for in&s;tance, one of the be&s;t in the old te&s;|tament, is attributed by divines to various authors; &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e Mo&s;es wrote it, while he tended his fa|ther-in-law's &s;heep in the land of Midian; others ima|gine it to be the work of Job him&s;elf; and others think it was witten by Elihu the Buzite; while no per&s;on can be certain that it was the production of ei|ther. And how can he inform us, that the Jewi&s;h writers did not profit by the works of the Greek and Roman morali&s;ts, in&s;tead of the contrary? or in &s;hort, whether the chri&s;tian faith was not, according to Mr. Paine (which in all probability is the ca&s;e) built with the &s;ame materials, and founded upon the ruins of the ancient &s;y&s;tem of heathen mythology?</P>
<P>Mr. Paine's ob&s;ervations on the word <HI>revelation,</HI> our critic &s;ays, in page 16, are inacurate, &s;allacious and inconclu&s;ive; and proceeds to prove his a&s;&s;er&s;ion by what he calls "a rational and unexceptionable repre|&s;entation of the point in que&s;tion."</P>
<P>Were the Jews at that time, or is he at pre&s;ent, fully acquainted with all the laws and operations of nature? Is he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that infinite wi&s;dom which compre|hends every property, power and quality of the whole creation? Can his purblind eye, at one view, di&s;cern
<PB N="32" REF="026954_0030_0FD2946D916B9840">all the improvements and di&s;coveries that may hereaf|ter be made in every art and &s;cience? If &s;o, then is he capable of determining what are &s;upernatural proofs of a revelation. But, &s;ays he, "Whether &s;uch a di&s;play were in reality made in the ca&s;e before us, is not now the que&s;tion." Why is it not? If a di&s;play of &s;upernatural agency was nece&s;&s;ary to prove the authority of the Jewi&s;h revelation, why is it not likewi&s;e to the chri&s;ti|an? For if there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for this di&s;|play to &s;upport the doctrine of Mo&s;es; then without that agency it was not entitled to belief. Con&s;equent|ly, if the chri&s;tian faith was not attended by &s;omething &s;upernatural, mankind could not be expected to believe it. And if there was once a nece&s;&s;ity for miracles to confirm the doctrine of the go&s;pel, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why there is not at the pre&s;ent time. We find, in the &s;criptures, that when Je&s;us &s;ent out his di&s;ciples to preach the go&s;pel to the world, he gave them power to rai&s;e the dead, heal the &s;ick, ca&s;t out devils, and cure the blind, deaf and dumb, to convince mankind of the truth of their doctrines. But we &s;ee nothing of the kind in the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel (at this day) to prove their divine mi&s;&s;ion: though in the bible the doctrine with its proofs are related as in&s;eparably connected to|gether. And if they preach it without exhibiting its proofs, how can we believe them? We mu&s;t conclude that the preacher and his doctrine are both without au|thority; as <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> is all the evidence we have of their authenticity. Indeed, as in the early ages of chri&s;tianity, we hear of frequent in&s;tances of miracles being per|formed by low, illiterate per&s;ons, by which they have obtained the honorable appellation of <HI>&s;aints,</HI> &s;o among the mo&s;t ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious nations of the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="33" REF="026954_0031_0FD2946F08C5B270">&s;ent age, the reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of &s;ome of the&s;e deified &s;aints are &s;aid to perform wonderful cures, and other &s;upernatu|ral feats. Whether the miracles wrought by the for|mer, are entitled to a greater degree of credit than tho&s;e performed by the latter, every one can judge for him&s;elf. It is worthy of note, however, that the&s;e mi|raculous performances, whenever exhibited in &s;upport of any other cau&s;e, are called by chri&s;tians, artificial deceptions or diabolical cheats.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to Mr. Paine's ob&s;ervation, that "vi&s;iting the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children is contrary to every principle of moral ju&s;tice," Mr. Wakefield bluntly a&s;&s;erts, "Nothing in reality can be more feeble and in|efficient than this objection."</P>
<P>That for the &s;ins of fathers their children, whether innocent or guilty, &s;hould &s;uffer puni&s;hment, is a prin|ciple contrary to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and the laws of every well governed nation. It is a maxim of moral polity, that it is better that an hundred guilty &s;hould e&s;cape, than one innocent &s;hould &s;uffer: but according to the foregoing doctrine, an indi&s;criminate puni&s;hment falls alike upon the innocent and the guilty.</P>
<P>The difficulties concerning the immaculate concep|tion of Je&s;us, our author "concedes to the Dei&s;t, for his own part, in all their force, as pertinent in them|&s;elves, and of &s;erious &s;ignificancy to tho&s;e whom they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ncern. This, &s;ays he, con&s;titutes no e&s;&s;ential article of my creed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d certainly re&s;ts on much weaker evi|dence than any other important fact of all the go&s;pels." The evidence of the divine authority of the &s;criptures, I always thought was the &s;ame for one part as for any other: at any rate, I cannot &s;ee that it is
<PB N="34" REF="026954_0032_0FD294708791FD00">weaker in this in&s;tance than any where el&s;e; and &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, if there was any difference, it &s;hould be in favor of this particular circum&s;tance; as the pro|phets, who, it is &s;aid, &s;o often foretold his coming, mentioned as one of the mo&s;t important proofs of his authority, that "a virgin &s;hould conceive and bear a &s;on."</P>
<P>But I certainly agree with our author in believing the &s;tory not &s;ufficiently authenticated to be entitled to a place in my creed. At the &s;ame time, as we have the &s;ame evidence for this that we have for every other part of the bible, viz. hear&s;ay; it is full as worthy of belief as any other miraculous &s;tory related in it.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Paine's remarks on the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the morality which he preached, he &s;ays, (page 20) "The former part is excellent; the latter was never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in ignorance and ab&s;urdity." He did not con&s;ider his examination in the light that many do, or he would not have made this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>"To &s;ay, moreover, of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem merely, that it has not been exceeded by any &s;y&s;tem ancient or modern, is &s;uch a mi&s;conception as candor will choo&s;e to impute, not to malignant di&s;paragement, but to an ignorance rather of the philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tems of anti|quity, and the comparative merits of evangelical mo|rality."</P>
<P>Our author wi&s;hes to make it appear, that to &s;ay merely that it has not been exceeded by any, he con&s;i|ders as a malignant di&s;paragement of a &s;y&s;tem, which in his own opinion is a jumble of truth, fal&s;hood, puri|ty and ab&s;urdity: for in the very preceding page he will not admit one of its fundamental doctrines into his
<PB N="35" REF="026954_0033_0FD294745CE9E2D0">creed. Or he means that it is an ignoront di&s;parage|ment of the philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tems of antiquity, to &s;up|po&s;e the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem equal to them; the ambigu|ous manner in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf rendering it uncertain what his real meaning is.</P>
<P>Our author's next &s;entence, page 21, contains a caution, to avoid that very line of conduct which he has him&s;elf &s;o fully practi&s;ed. "I wi&s;h tho&s;e heavenly maxims of Solon and the &s;on of Sirach, <HI>know thy&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>under&s;tand fir&s;t, and then rebuke;</HI> were more deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts and memories of us all."</P>
<P>"Je&s;us Chri&s;t wrote no account of him&s;elf," &s;ays Mr. Paine; to which our author replies, "to this argument again&s;t the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|&s;wers might be in&s;tituted: but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one only, which appears to my mind incapable of con|futation upon any principle of philo&s;ophy or experi|ence: and will indeed admit of no di&s;pute, but upon po&s;itions &s;ubver&s;ive of all hi&s;torical te&s;timony what&s;o|ever, and introductory of univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m."</P>
<P>"The numerous circum&s;tances inter&s;per&s;ed through the <HI>go&s;pel narratives</HI> and in the acts of the apo&s;tles, ap|pertaining to the geography of countries, the po&s;itions of rivers, towns and cities, &amp;c. &amp;c. with a va&s;t multi|plicity of detached occurrences and facts, not nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;pecified at large, challenge (to &s;peak with mo|deration) as large a portion of credibility to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e books, con&s;idered in the light of <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> te&s;timonies, as can be claimed for any writings whatever, received as genuine, and equally ancient and multi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.

<PB N="36" REF="026954_0034_0FD294761AE01C98">of narrative by hi&s;tory of &s;o credible a character with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of their relations: but, when the&s;e <HI>extraordinary facts</HI> are found to have &s;o intimate an in|corporation with the common and un&s;u&s;picious occur|rences of the&s;e hi&s;tories &s;o as to admit of no detach|ment, but to &s;tand or fall with the main body of the&s;e compo&s;itions; I cannot &s;ee how any hi&s;torical proba|bility of the authenticity of the&s;e extraordinary events can ri&s;e higher than in &s;uch an in&s;tance."</P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous argu|ments that could po&s;&s;ibly enter the imagination of man. Becau&s;e the framers of a &s;tory, to give it the appearance of probability, have artfully inter&s;per&s;ed through the whole &s;ome hi&s;torical and geographical facts, which cannot be controverted; our author pre|tends that every part is equally entitled to our fulle&s;t belief. Suppo&s;e that Mr. Paine had a&s;&s;erted, that he was in Luxembourg, Paris, on the 27th of January, 1794, as he certainly was; mentioning &s;everal impor|tant circum&s;tances that occured there at that time; and conclude with declaring that an angel appeared to him, took the pen from his hand, and wrote every word of the Age of Rea&s;on. This &s;tory then, according to Mr. Wakefield's rea&s;oning, would be undoubtedly true: the miraculous part of it would admit of no detach|ment, but mu&s;t &s;tand or fall with the main body of the relation; and as the hi&s;torical and geographical facts could not be denied, the whole mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed as divine and infallible truth. If this be ju&s;t rea&s;oning, it is what was never known before; and our author may congratulate him&s;elf on the honor of a di&s;covery of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to the literary and thinking world: for at this rate, the Arabian Night's entertain|ment,
<PB N="37" REF="026954_0035_0FD294775B7C50E0">Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, and every tale or novel in be|ing, would be confirmed as indubitable realities.</P>
<P>But he proceeds to "unfold the purport of this rea&s;oning," by informing us, at great length, that ma|ny di&s;ciples &s;uffered martyrdom in de&s;ence of what they declared they had &s;een and heard. And what does it all amount to? Have not multitudes of Jews, Maho|metans, and every other national &s;ect on earth, &s;uf|fered martyrdom with as much zeal and con&s;tancy as ever the apo&s;tles or any other chri&s;tians did? That they were incapable of being deceived re&s;pecting the angels, miracles, or wonders which they might &s;uppo&s;e they &s;aw and heard, no per&s;on will contend. Animal magneti&s;m, pretended gho&s;ts and witches, not to men|tion whole nations being deceived by fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, pro|phetic gyp&s;ies, and wonder-working conjurers, are &s;uf|ficient to &s;hew the extent to which the human mind may be impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>To Mr. Paine's ob&s;ervations on the demon&s;tration of the re&s;urrection, our author makes this remark; "Not a thou&s;andth part of the people in Great-Bri|tain &s;aw Lunardi go up from the Art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lery Ground in a balloon; but the &s;uperior impul&s;e to any po&s;&s;ible ac|tion of my mind, who &s;aw him, in con&s;equence of that event, does not exceed the impul&s;e to a &s;imilar action on the mind of another who did not &s;ee him, by an <HI>evanc|&s;cent infinite&s;imal</HI> of efficacy." The meaning of which I &s;uppo&s;e to be, that as the people of Great-Britain be|lieved in the a&s;&s;en&s;ion of Lunardi, though they did not &s;ee him go up; &s;o all mankind &s;hould believe in the re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though they were not eye-witne&s;&s;es of the fact. But the ca&s;es are not at all &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ilar: the one is a thing po&s;&s;ible and ve|probable;
<PB N="38" REF="026954_0036_0FD29478C8B96600">but the other is impo&s;&s;ible. The generality of people in Great-Britain and every other country, have &s;een globes of cloth, paper, or &s;omething el&s;e of the na|ture of a balloon, a&s;cend; which would convince them that the thing was po&s;&s;ible, and therefore entitled to &s;ome degree of credibility. Even the mo&s;t ignorant cook, that &s;ees a potlid rai&s;ed by the &s;team of boiling water, mu&s;t be convinced of the probability of the fact. Whereas no man living ever faw a per&s;on ri&s;e from perfect death, fly in the air, or any thing of the kind ever performed; and therefore cannot believe the &s;tory without ocular conviction of its truth. He next takes much pains to convince us, that the Jews were at that time a vicious and corrupt people; and not at all likely to believe in the authority and doctrines of Je&s;us; even &s;o depraved that it would have been next to a miracle if they had accepted his mi&s;&s;ion. He labours hard to e&s;tabli&s;h this propo&s;ition, by compairing Mr. Paine and his rights of man to Je&s;us and his preaching; both &s;uf|fering, one in effigy, the other in reality, by the very people for who&s;e happine&s;s they were laboring. Ob|&s;erving, "upon the whole, we find no difficulty in de|claring, that what has a&s;toni&s;hed Mr. Paine &s;o long, &s;hould a&s;toni&s;h him no longer; as no &s;pecies of rea&s;on|ing is more common and more legitimate, than that which proves the truth of a circum&s;tance from the evi|dence of corrupt and intere&s;ted witne&s;&s;es, who a&s;&s;ert it is fal&s;e." If Mr. Wakefield can clearly prove to us, that the Jews were at that time &s;o corrupt and intere&s;ted that few, very few, and tho&s;e mean and ignorant, were prevailed upon to believe a doctrine, which, though op|po&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by the nation in general, was &s;till undoubtedly true, and confirmed by many real mira|cles;
<PB N="39" REF="026954_0037_0FD2953D5BD3C780">if he can convince us of this, he may then hold the rejection of the go&s;pel by the Jews as no good ar|gument again&s;t its reality. But how is he to do this? We have only his <HI>hardy a&s;&s;er&s;ion</HI> for it; and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be the height of ab&s;urdity to let that outweigh or de&s;|troy the credibility of a whole nation.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine next appears to our author, in page 32, in his ob&s;ervations on the &s;tory of the devil and his an|gels, as a <HI>tumid and hypertragical declaimer;</HI> although he cannot avoid agreeing with him on the &s;ubject, which he likewi&s;e illu&s;trates by &s;everal learned and (in his opi|nion) conclu&s;ive remarks. But it &s;eems, before he had fini&s;hed his paragraph, that he perceived he was con|firming in&s;tead of confuting his antagoni&s;t. He there|fore, recollecting which &s;ide of the que&s;tion he had en|gaged to &s;upport, exclaims, "Alas! our dei&s;t fancied him&s;elf in &s;tout combat with genuine chri&s;tianity, whil&s;t he was buffeting a mere phantum of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition! So ea&s;y is declamation again&s;t folly!"</P>
<P>"The&s;e books, beginning with Gene&s;is, and ending with Revelations (which, by the bye, is a book of rid|dles, that requires a revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God," &s;ays Mr. Paine; to which our author replies,</P>
<P>"The vindicator, who occupies him&s;elf in the confu|tation of &s;uch un&s;upported and dogmatical a&s;&s;ertions, is not much more excu&s;able than the <HI>ignoramus,</HI> who has the audacity to produce them." Here, becau&s;e he has no othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubterfuge at hand, he in&s;tantly converts the "&s;agacious, plain, &s;en&s;ible Thomas Paine" into an au|dacious ignoramus, and impudently endeavors to ex|po&s;e the ab&s;urdity of his calling the Apocrypha the
<PB N="40" REF="026954_0038_0FD2953F80B1A0A8">word of God, when it is evident that he intended no &s;uch thing; for he &s;ays expre&s;sly, that they were voted to be doubtful. What a mi&s;erable &s;ituation mu&s;t our re|doubtable champion be in, when he is under the wretch|ed nece&s;&s;ity of attacking theideal &s;pectres of his ownima|gination, in&s;tead of the real and &s;ub&s;tantial arguments of his opponent. We find al&s;o, that he pa&s;&s;es over the mo&s;t important and influential parts of Mr. Paine's rea|&s;oning, and dwells upon tho&s;e only which he fondly imagines he can oppo&s;e or ridicule, with at lea&s;t &s;ome appearance of confidence and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine &s;ays, "When the church mythologi&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;y&s;tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they plea|&s;ed."</P>
<P>This, Mr. Wakefield boldly a&s;&s;erts, page 36, "is an undige&s;ted and inaccurate &s;tatement of the ca&s;e;" and after giving us &s;everal more of his a&s;&s;ertions and opini|ons, comes off exultingly with, "What need of cir|cum&s;tantial detail in repelling the objections of men, who really knew ju&s;t nothing of the &s;ubject, and &s;atisfy their <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> by peremptory a&s;&s;everation only, unilluminated by one &s;ingle ray of information on the topic in di&s;pute?" By &s;uch pitiful eva&s;ions, &s;uch un&s;ounded in&s;inuations, and &s;uch impertinent que&s;tions, is our profound author to "vindicate his &s;aith in chri&s;tianity upon principles truly rational and unambiguou&s;ly explicit, or relinqui&s;h it altogether." He continues, "It were mo&s;t ea&s;y to enlarge on this &s;ubject; but more has been &s;aid already, than &s;uch de&s;ultory and un&s;ub&s;tantiated allegations have any rea&s;on to expect:" Yes, truly; and more than any thing el&s;e could have
<PB N="41" REF="026954_0039_0FD29540EA9CFF20">rea&s;on toexpect, from any but the mo&s;t conceited pedant; and more than can po&s;&s;ibly reflect the lea&s;t degree of credit on either his cau&s;e, his heart, or his head. "And I &s;hall only add, from a multitude of cogent in&s;tances, with reference to <HI>one</HI> branch of evidence of the fir&s;t moment, that a compari&s;on of the 28th chapter of Deu|toronomy caly, with the &s;ub&s;equent and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the I&s;raeliti&s;h nation, mu&s;t fla&s;h conviction, I &s;hould think, upon any mind, not totally prejudiced and per|verted, in favor of the <HI>prophetical</HI> preten&s;ions of the <HI>&s;criptures:</HI> for that the book of Dueteronomy was com|po&s;ed po&s;terior to tho&s;e events, what effrontery even of unlearned dei&s;m, if it hazard the a&s;&s;ertion, will under|take to prove?" It may perhaps be as hard to prove that it was written po&s;terior to tho&s;e events, as the con|trary. But the more time that elap&s;es &s;ince the writ|ing of it, renders the probability of its not coming to us unchanged and mi&s;tran&s;lated, the greater. And at any rate, it cannot be held up as an argument in favor of the divine authority of the new te&s;tament: for by the appearance of Chri&s;t on earth, we are told, the law, by which the&s;e cur&s;es were entailed on the Jews, was aboli&s;hed. Indeed it reduces that nation to a mo&s;t unhappy dilemma: for if they do not continue to per|form the injunctions of this law, all the cur&s;es of Par|dora's box are heaped on their devoted heads; and if they do not embrace the doctrines of the go&s;pel, that repeals this law, they are to be damned to all eternity. The&s;e &s;ufferings too, when &s;u&s;tained by the Jews for an adhereance to their &s;aith, were the ju&s;t judgments of God, for di&s;obedience as prophe&s;ied in the &s;criptures; but when born by the chri&s;tians, were cruel and unju&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="026954_0040_0FD29544EEF0E438">per&s;ecutions, in&s;tigated by the devil, in oppo&s;ition to the divine will.</P>
<P>Our author next attacks Mr. Paine's definition of the word revelation, with as much courage and fiercene&s;s as though he would annihilate the whole &s;y&s;tem of de|i&s;m with one &s;troke. He calls it "not only the <HI>e&s;&s;ence,</HI> but the <HI>quinte&s;&s;ence,</HI> of all weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity:" at the &s;ame time tacitly acknowledging it to be ju&s;t, and an&s;wering all the purpo&s;e for which it was intended; by the following confe&s;&s;ion, "The greater part of the <HI>bible-hi&s;tory</HI> contains &s;imply a narrative of the political occurrences, the Jews; and the tran&s;actions record|ed are, therefore, to be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light with tho&s;e of all other hi&s;tories; namely, as aggravated and di&s;gui&s;ed in a thou&s;and in&s;tances by pa&s;&s;ing through the mediam of national partiality."</P>
<P>"Aggravated and di&s;gui&s;ed in a thou&s;and in&s;tan|ces!" A very candid and important confe&s;&s;ion, Mr. Wakefield; and if you can only point out to us which the&s;e thou&s;and in&s;tances are, we will perhaps allow the remainder a little more credit than we can the whole, before we are &s;atisfied in that particular.</P>
<P>His next acknowledgment is, "I agree with Thomas Paine, that the account of the creation, with which the book of Cene&s;is opens, has all the appearance of being a tradition, which the I&s;raelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their hi&s;tory, without telling, as it is mo&s;t probable that they did not know, how they came by it." Another very im|portant conce&s;&s;ion. And if the &s;cripture account of the creation, is nothing more than a tradition (and all nations have their di&s;&s;erent traditions) what be|comes
<PB N="43" REF="026954_0041_0FD295482D1A7E58">comes of the credibility of the &s;tory of original &s;in, Adam's damning all mankind by eating an apple, &amp;c? It mu&s;t certainly fall to the ground, together with the nece&s;&s;ity of a mediator to repair the lo&s;s, and every other doctrine founded on this tradition.</P>
<P>"But, &s;ays he, what maje&s;ty of &s;entiment, what a dignified &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion, characterizes the Mo|&s;aic account of the creation of the world!" In the name of common &s;en&s;e, what has maje&s;ty of &s;entiment, or dignified &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion to do with the truth or fal&s;hood of a &s;tory? Truth is truth, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of artificial &s;upport: and all the maje&s;tic &s;en|timents, and dignified expre&s;&s;ions that were ever invent|ed, cannot make a fal&s;e &s;tory true.</P>
<P>"To all that occurs comprehending any objections to the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution, a very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer has, if I mi&s;take not, been already given." Yes, truly: if no other an&s;wer can be found, what has been already given, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us of the propriety of the objections.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine &s;ays, "why it has been called the Mo&s;aic acconnt of the creation, I am at a lo&s;s to conceive.&mdash; Mo&s;es, I believe, was too good a judge of &s;uch &s;ub|jects to put his name to that account. He had been educated among the Egyptians, who were a people as well &s;killed in &s;cience, and particularly in a&s;|tronomy, as any people of their day." To which Mr. W. an&s;wers: "All this may be literally true: but a palpable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">truth is implied in it; that the Egyptians were really a learned and &s;cientific people: whereas their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;tronomy was ju&s;t nothing at all. If not, produce me your youchers to this fact, from exi&s;t|ing
<PB N="44" REF="026954_0042_0FD2954952154D90">monuments or ancient te&s;timony." To what pur|po&s;e is it whether the Egyptians were really at that time a learned people or not? How can the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject affect the point in que&s;tion? and yet our au|thor takes up near two pages in endeavoring to prove this unintere&s;ting and impertinent a&s;&s;ertion; or rather to di&s;play his extraordinary knowledge of ancient hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine ob&s;erves, "If we permit our&s;elves to con|ceive right ideas of things, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affix the idea, not only of unchangeablene&s;s, but of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honor with the name of the word of God; and there|fore the word of God cannot exi&s;t in any written or hu|man language."</P>
<P>To which our author replies, fir&s;t, by a&s;king "What can be more frivolous, or unworthy of a man of &s;en&s;e?" then giving us his ideas of a revelation, and finally by endeavoring to prove that we believe the Jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian revelations as fully as we do that Michael An|gelo, planned the fabric of St. Peter's at Rome, and Sir Chri&s;topher Wren, that of St. Paul's in London.</P>
<P>Well may <HI>we</HI> a&s;k, "What can be more frivolous, and unworthy a man of &s;en&s;e?" The compari&s;on here introduced, is as fallacious and improper as can po&s;&s;i|bly be conceived. For whoever &s;ees the fabries of St. Peter's and St. Paul's, mu&s;t be convinced, that they were planned by Michael Angelo, Chri&s;topher Wren, or &s;ome other per&s;ons; as there is no other way by which they po&s;&s;ibly could have been in exi&s;tence; and we likewi&s;e &s;ee, that fabries are planned every day. But if Mr. Wakefield can convince us, that there was no
<PB N="45" REF="026954_0043_0FD2954C6EB66B78">other way than a revelation from heaven by which the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tems of religion could have been in exi&s;tence; and that &s;uch revelations are com|mon, and occur every day; then will we allow the compari&s;on to be ju&s;t, and the inferences he draws from it rea&s;onable. As this is impo&s;&s;ible, we mu&s;t conclude, that the ca&s;es are entirely di&s;&s;imilar, the &s;imilitude fal&s;e, and the whole argument ab&s;urd and inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>On Mr. Paine's ob&s;erving, "The event that &s;erved more than any other to break the fir&s;t link in this long chain of de&s;potic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation of Luther." Mr. Wakefield ad|vances as an argument, "Surely it forms no mean pre&s;umption in favor of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of revela|tion, that the re&s;toration of &s;cience and the rectification of religion, &s;hould be congenial and contemporary; that the beams of knowledge &s;hould di&s;pel the damps and darkne&s;s of ignorant &s;uper&s;tition, but contribute illumination and vigour to the &s;incere go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Whether the reformation of &s;cience did really con|tribute illumination and vigour to the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a point not clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and whether, if a complete and unlimited re&s;toration of &s;cience had taken place, the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem would not have been wholly rejected, might be in&s;i&s;ted on, with much more rea&s;on than many of his a&s;&s;ertions. But one plain, un|deniable po&s;ition, of the &s;ame nature with our author's, will &s;ufficiently overbalance the weight of his argu|ment: as we may a&s;&s;ert, with equal confidence, that it is no mean pre&s;umption in favor of the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of dei&s;m, and the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of divine revela|tion,
<PB N="46" REF="026954_0044_0FD2954E0C302DA0">that the re&s;toration of civil and religious liberty, and the rejection of all revealed religion, in France, &s;hould be congenial and contemporary; that the beams of know|ledge &s;hould di&s;pel the damps and darkne&s;s of ignorant &s;uper&s;tition and hereditary de&s;poti&s;m, but add illumina|tion, vigour and confirmation, to the &s;incere and unerring religion of nature, and revive the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and dei&s;m.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;lied mathematicians (mathema|tics, according to the latter part of this &s;ame paragraph, has no connection with religion: what does it &s;ignify, then, that di&s;tingui&s;hed mathematicians believe the chri&s;tian revelation ?) and philo&s;ophers of our own country, Baron, Boyle, Newton, Locke, Barrow and Hartley, have been the firme&s;t believers of the chri&s;ti|an revelation." To which may be oppo&s;ed as many di&s;tingui&s;hed names on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion: The greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, and mo&s;t virtuous of their country, Voltaire, Rou&s;&s;eau, Pope, Bolinbroke, Hume, Franklin and Paine, have been the firme&s;t di&s;believers of the chri&s;tian revelation.</P>
<P>We will here further illu&s;trate the ab&s;urdity of Mr. W's rea&s;oning, in his &s;trictures upon Mr. P's remanksupon re|velation. Mr. P. endeavors to prove that "the hi&s;torical and annectdotal part of the bible, which is almo&s;t the whole of it, is not within the meaning and compa&s;s of the word revelation, and therefore is not the word of God." He ob&s;erves, "Revelation is a communication of &s;ome|thing, which the per&s;on, to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing, or &s;een it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or &s;een it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it." To which Mr. W. replies, "&s;o then, not only the profe&s;&s;ors of philo&s;ophy at the highe&s;t places of educa|tion,
<PB N="47" REF="026954_0045_0FD295501056FBC0">but every dame, that teaches the <HI>born-book</HI> in a country village, communicates, it &s;eems, a revelation!" This remark is certainly beneath the &s;en&s;e of Mr. Wakefield, if I relate what I have done, or &s;een done, it is no revelation, it requires no immediate in&s;piration from heaven to enable me to tell it.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine's di&s;&s;mi&s;&s;ion is clear and pertinent; and to predend that it nece&s;&s;arily follows from his po&s;ition that every thing told to a per&s;on, which he did not know before, is a revelation, is the height of &s;ophi&s;try. No|thing but a puerile habit of &s;yllogi&s;tic di&s;putation (which Mr. Wakefield probably acquired at Je&s;us' Col|lege) could have betrayed him into &s;o weak an argu|ment. It is not unlike the fyllogi&s;m of the mou&s;e and chee&s;e, noticed by Senea. "Two legged animals eat chee&s;e, a mou&s;e is not a two legged animal, therefore a mou&s;e does not eat chee&s;e." "Away with the&s;e child|i&s;h follies!"</P>
<P>Mr. Paine makes &s;ome very ju&s;t remarks upon the impropriety of obliging boys, at this day, to wa&s;te their genius and time in delving over the dear languages; ob&s;erving that the rea&s;on which once operated in favor of the&s;e &s;tudies now cea&s;e to exi&s;t, &s;ince all the ancient authors of note are tran&s;lated into modern languages; which have received every improvement nece&s;&s;ary to embelli&s;h them. To which Mr. W. makes the follow|ing clowni&s;h reply, "all have not that &s;en&s;ibility of perception, and that elegance of ta&s;te, which is nece&s;&s;ary to a reli&s;h of the inimitable beauties of ancient compo|&s;ition. I may be, for example, a delicate bird, delighted in &s;trawberries and the choice&s;t fruits&mdash;Thomas Paine, a crow; who prefers a fea&s;t on carrion and putre&s;&s;ence." For &s;hame, Mr. Wakefield, did you learn to make &s;uch
<PB N="48" REF="026954_0046_0FD295518FD42F60">compari&s;ons at Je&s;us' College! Mr. Paine then becau&s;e he prefers reading modern authors, and the tran&s;lation of the ancients, in modern languages, is a crow, and likes to fea&s;t on matter which that bird is peculiarly fond of. While your&s;elf who are delighted with trea|&s;uring up Greek and Hebrew, in order to a&s;toni&s;h your pari&s;hioners with your <HI>va&s;t</HI> learning, and to convince them of your divine mi&s;&s;ion, are to be &s;ure a very <HI>deli|cate bird</HI> indeed. You pay a very great compliment to the ancients at the expence of the moderns; and, perhaps, when &s;ome part of your compo&s;ition in this reply are taken into con&s;ideration with a con&s;iderable degree of propriety.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the beauties of compo&s;ition, it is the height of ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e that a per&s;on, not thorough|ly ver&s;ed in ancient languages (which is rarely the ca&s;e) can di&s;cover &s;o many beauties in the original, as would be communicated to him in a good tran&s;lation. Be&s;ides is it prudent to be &s;o prodigal of time, &s;ince human life is reduced to &s;o &s;hort a period, as to &s;pend &s;even or eight years in &s;earching for <HI>beauties</HI> in dead languages? The idea is oppo&s;ed to the rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>His la&s;t ob&s;ervation on his opponent is, "Mr. Paine de&s;cants with a tolerable &s;hare of merriment, in the conclu&s;ion of his pamphlet, re&s;pecting Jonah and the Whale, which my &s;tomach al&s;o feels an equal indi&s;po&s;i|tion to ingurgitate." O what bla&s;phemy! to di&s;believe a plan, unequivocal, and uncontradicted &s;cripture ac|count, wrote by the prophet him&s;elf, who centainly mu&s;t have been the be&s;t competent judge of the affair! To doubt the word of an in&s;pired prophet! Why, Mr. Wakefield, you may as well &s;u&s;pect the truth of every part of the bible, which you find not confirmed by the
<PB N="49" REF="026954_0047_0FD29559D95BB6E8">te&s;timony of ancient profane hi&s;tory and your own weak fallible rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"It is not unlike a tale that I lately heard, which ma|ny will think not inferior to that before us in &s;ymptoms of credibility.

Bla&s;phemy, horrid bla&s;phemy again!

<P>This la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>perched on a tubercle of the purte|nance,</HI> with his <HI>"evan&s;cent infinite&s;imal of efficacy,"</HI> and &s;everal others, independent of the general complection of the work, and his latin notes, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly inter|&s;per&s;ed through it; mu&s;t certainly convince us, that he is, without &s;ufficient &s;en&s;e to conceal, or judgment to di&s;gui&s;e it, a vain, conceited, boa&s;ting pedant; not attending &s;o much to argument as to pompo&s;ity, truth as to affected &s;ublimity, or rea&s;on as to &s;ophi&s;try and declamation.</P>
<P>"I have now, &s;ays he, fini&s;hed my remarks on this pamphlet of Thomas Paine; which has been extended thus far, more in deference to the de&s;erved celebrity of the name, than the powers of the di&s;putant; nor am I con&s;cious to my&s;elf of eluding any difficulty, or &s;hrink|ing from the terrors of a &s;ingle argument, in the cour&s;e of this examination.

<HEAD>THE AGE OF INFIDELITY, BY A LAYMAN, IS THE NEXT IN THE ORDER OF ATTACK AGAINST THE FATAL BLOW TO FANATICISM AND PRIESTCRAFT, THE AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the polemic abilities of this writer, and his thorough knowledge of all the arguments for and again&s;t the tenets he profe&s;&s;es, we are inclined to believe that he here appears under fal&s;e colours, being really a gentleman of the <HI>cloth:</HI> perhaps &s;ome may think a <HI>pious fraud</HI> in this ca&s;e ju&s;tifiable; we only &s;ugge&s;t it to put the reader on his guard again&s;t the artful rea&s;oning of a per&s;on who may think him&s;elf intere&s;ted in &s;upport|ing the pre&s;ent impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As many of the errors in this paraphlet have been animadverted upon in our reply to Mr. Wakefield, and as a minute examination of it would far exceed our intended limits, we &s;hall only notice the mo&s;t promi|nent ab&s;urdities that appear on a cur&s;ary review of the work.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="026954_0050_0FD2955E59E6E7B8">
The author commences thus, "In an age like this, it is no wonder that infidelity has its champions. The genuine go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is a &s;y&s;tem too pure and divine to meet the cordial approbation of men of vicious hearts and corrupt principles; and &s;uch have hitherto compo&s;ed the majority of mankind."</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the morality which Chri&s;t preached, infidels, or the di&s;believers in revelation, acknowledge its purity, and ob&s;erve it often more &s;crupulou&s;ly, than tho&s;e who make &s;o great pretentions to piety. But they contend that it required no <HI>divine nature</HI> to teach &s;uch doctrine, as many, whom chri&s;tians call heathens, have taught and practi&s;ed the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And they conceive that there can be neither virtue nor vice, in believing or di&s;believing any particular &s;peculative opinion. Virtue and vice con&s;i&s;t in actions, and not in creeds.</P>
<P>The latter part of the pa&s;&s;age cited above, contains a &s;evere cen&s;ure upon the majority of mankind, which they by no means merit. Every one who is the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in &s;ociety, and will credit his own experi|ence, in&s;tead of the gloomy le&s;&s;ons of his nur&s;e; and tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted to deceive him, will atte&s;t to the fallacy and illiberality of this a&s;per&s;ion. From con|&s;tantly viewing human nature upon the dark &s;ide, from hearing it continually fulminated from the pulpit, that <HI>man is prone to evil, as the &s;parks &s;ly upward,</HI> has ari&s;en this illfounded opinion.</P>
<P>We have been taught to believe that mankind were by nature depraved, at enmity with God and one ano|ther, and if it were in their power would hurl the om|nipotent from his throne.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="026954_0051_0FD2956245FEF538">
How ungenerous, how wicked the deception! meet your fellow creature in any part of the globe, and (reli|gious and political prejudices apart) he greets you as his brother, takes part in your &s;ufferings, and &s;ooths your afflictions.</P>
<P>To fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems of education, and not to evil di&s;po|&s;itions in human nature, are owing the calamities of mankind. The doctrine of total depravity has perhaps a greater tendency to viciate the morals of mankind than any &s;entiment that has ever been propagated. Tell a man that you know him to be a rogue, and you in&s;pire him with a propen&s;ity to cheat you.</P>
<P>"To compare," &s;ays the Layman, "the propaga|tion of Mahomet's &s;y&s;tem with that of Judai&s;m or chri&s;t|ianity, is weak and unju&s;t in the extreme. Mahomet wrought no miracles, delivered no predictions: but, on the contrary, founded his dominion on the &s;word. There is therefore no compari&s;on."</P>
<P>This is the a&s;&s;ertion of a bigoted chri&s;tian; let us hear what the votaries of Mahomet have to &s;ay on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. "They affirm that he fed the hungry, cured the &s;ick, and rai&s;ed the dead, and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally &s;ubject to the apo&s;tle of God. A my&s;terious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from the temple of Mecca to that of Jeru&s;alem: with his companion Gabriel, he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;cended the &s;even heavens and received and repaid the &s;alutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the angels, in their re&s;pective man&s;ions. Beyond the &s;eventh heavens, Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed; he pa&s;&s;ed the veil of unity, approached with|in two bow-&s;hots of the throne, and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his &s;houlder was touch|ed
<PB N="54" REF="026954_0052_0FD29566938233A0">by the hand of God. After this familiar though important conver&s;ation, he again de&s;cended to Jeru&s;a|lom, remounted the Borak, and returned to Mecca."

<P>The&s;e miracles a mu&s;ulman believes with as much a&s;&s;urance, as a Jew, or chri&s;tian, the extraordinary ex|ploits related in the old and new te&s;tament. And why not with the &s;ame colour of rea&s;on? "In all religions the life of the founder &s;upplies the &s;ilence of his written revelation: the &s;ayings of Mahomet were &s;o many le&s;&s;ons of truth; his actions &s;o many examples of virtue.</P>
<P>"The in&s;piration of the Hebrew prophets, of the apo&s;|tles and evangeli&s;ts of Chri&s;t, might not be incompati|ble with the exerci&s;e of their rea&s;on and memory; and the diver&s;ity of their genius is &s;trongly marked in the &s;tyle and compo&s;ition of the books of the old and new te&s;tament. But Mahomet was content with a charac|ter, more humble, yet more &s;ublime, of a &s;imple editor: the &s;ub&s;tance of the Koran, according to him&s;elf or his di&s;ciples, is uncreated and eternal; &s;ub&s;i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the e&s;&s;ence of the deity, in&s;cribed with a pen of light on the table of his everla&s;ting decrees. A paper copy in a volume of &s;ilk and gems, was brought down to the lowe&s;t heaven by the Angel Gabriel, who, under the Jewi&s;h economy, had indeed been di&s;patched on the mo&s;t important errands; and this tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger &s;ucce&s;&s;ively revealed the chapters and ver&s;es to the Arabian prophet."</P>
<P>Since Mr. Layman has introduced Mahomet, we will make a brief &s;tatement of the cau&s;es which led to his
<PB N="55" REF="026954_0053_0FD29569CC768188">e&s;tabli&s;hment; and take notice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant creeds and precepts enjoined in the Koran; by which we &s;hall be enabled to judge whether that religion and it; founder have merited all the abu&s;e which has been &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon them by chri&s;tian writers.

<P>"It is the boa&s;t of the Jewi&s;h apologi&s;ts, that while the learned nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polythei&s;m, their &s;imple ance&s;tors of Pale&s;tine pre&s;erved the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the true God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not ea&s;ily be re|conciled with the &s;tandard of <HI>human</HI> virtue: his meta|phy&s;ical qualities are darkly expre&s;&s;ed; but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the unity of his name is in&s;cribed on the fir&s;t table of the law; and his &s;anctuary was never defiled by any vi&s;ible image of the invi&s;ible e&s;&s;ence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the &s;piritual devotion of the &s;ynagogue. But the chil|dren of I&s;rael had cea&s;ed to be a people; and the reli|gions of the world were guilty, at lea&s;t in the eyes of the prophet, of giving &s;ons, or daughters, or compani|ons, to the &s;upreme God. In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manife&s;t and audacious: the Sabians are poorly excu&s;ed by the pre-eminence of the fir&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|net, or intelligence in their cele&s;tial hierarchy; and in the Magian &s;y&s;tem the conflict of the two principles betrays the imperfection of the conqueror. The chri&s;tians of the &s;eventh century had in&s;en&s;ibly relap&s;ed into a &s;emblance of pagani&s;m; their public and pri|vate
<PB N="56" REF="026954_0054_0FD2956B1AAC1060">vows were addre&s;&s;ed to the relics and images that di&s;graced the temples of the Ea&s;t: the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and &s;aints, and angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian heretics, who flouri&s;hed in the fruitful &s;oil of Arabia, inve&s;ted the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a godde&s;s. The my&s;teries of the Trinity and Incarnation <HI>appear</HI> to contradict the principle of the divine unity. In their obvious fen&s;e, they introduce three equal Deities, and transform the man Je&s;us into the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;on of God: an orthodox commentary will &s;atisfy only a believing mind; intemperate curio&s;ity and zeal had torn the veil of the &s;anctuary; and each of the Oriental &s;ects was eager to confe&s;s that all except them&s;elves, de&s;erv|ed the reproach of idolatry and polythei&s;m. The creed of Mahomet is free from &s;u&s;picion or ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious te&s;timony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca rejected the wor&s;hip of idols and men, of &s;tars and planets, on the rational principle that whatever ri&s;es mu&s;t &s;et, that whatever is born mu&s;t die, that whatever is corruptible mu&s;t decay and peri&s;h. In the author of the univer&s;e, his rational enthu&s;ia&s;m confe&s;&s;ed and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without i&s;&s;ue or &s;imili|tude, pre&s;ent to our mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, exi&s;ting by the nece&s;&s;ity of his own nature, and deriving from him|&s;elf all moral and intellectual perfection. The&s;e &s;u|blime truths, thus anounced in the language of the prophet, are firmly held by his di&s;ciples, and defined with metaphy&s;ical preci&s;ion by the interpreters of the Koran. A philo&s;ophic thei&s;t might &s;ub&s;cribe the po|pular

<P>"The fir&s;t principle of rea&s;on and revelation was con|firmed by the voice of Mahomet: his pro&s;elytes, from India to Morocco, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Unitarians;</HI> and the danger of idolatry has been pre|vented by the interdiction of images.</P>
<P>"The God of nature has written his exi&s;tence on all his works, and his law in the heart of man. To re|&s;tore the knowledge of the one and the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim of the pro|phets of every age: the liberality of Mahometallowed to his predece&s;&s;ors the &s;ame credit which he claimed for him&s;elf; and the chain of in&s;piration was pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onged from the fall of Adam to the promulgation of the Ko|ran. During that period, &s;ome rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and of the elect, di&s;criminated by their re&s;pective mea&s;ure of virtue and grace; three hundred and thir|teen apo&s;tles were &s;ent with a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion to recal their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four volumes have been dictated by the holy &s;pirit; and &s;ix legi&s;lators of tran&s;cendent brightne&s;s have an|nounced to mankind the &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion.</P>
<P>"During &s;ix hundred years the go&s;pel was the way of truth and &s;alvation; but the chri&s;tians in&s;en&s;ibly forgot both the laws and the example of their founder; and Mahomet was in&s;tructed by the Gno&s;tics to accu&s;e the church, as well as the &s;ynagogue, of corrupting the in|tegrity of the &s;acred text. The piety of Mo&s;es and of Chri&s;t rejoiced in the a&s;&s;urance of a future prophet,
<PB N="58" REF="026954_0056_0FD2956E99BC1AB0">more illu&s;trious than them&s;elves: the evangelic pro|mi&s;e of the <HI>Paraclete</HI> or. Holy Gho&s;t, was prefigured in the name, and accompli&s;hed in the per&s;on of Maho|met, the greate&s;t and the la&s;t of the apo&s;tles of God.</P>
<P>"The polythei&s;t is oppre&s;&s;ed and di&s;tracted by the va|riety of &s;uper&s;tition: a thou&s;and rights of Egyptian origin were interwoven with the e&s;&s;ence of the Mo&s;aic law: and the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel had evaporated in the pageantry of the church. The prophet of Mecca was tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patrioti&s;m, to &s;anc|tify the rites of the Arabians, and the cu&s;tom of vi&s;it|ing the holy &s;tone of the Caaba. But the precepts of Mahomet him&s;elf inculcate a more &s;imple and rational piety: prayer, fa&s;ting, and alms, are the religious du|ties of a mu&s;ulman; and he is encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half way to God, fa&s;ting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will gain him admittance.</P>
<P>"Cleanline&s;s is the key of prayer: the frequent lu&s;tra|tion of the hands, the face, and the body, which was practi&s;ed of old by the Arabs, is &s;olemnly enjoined by the Koran.</P>
<P>"Every &s;pot for the &s;ervice of God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the &s;treet. As a di&s;tinction from the Jews and chri&s;tians, the Friday in each week is &s;et apart for the u&s;eful in&s;titution of public wor&s;hip: the people are a&s;|&s;embled in the mo&s;ch and the imam: &s;ome re&s;pectable elder a&s;cends the pulpit, to begin the prayer and pro|nounce the &s;ermon. But the Mahometan religion is de&s;titute of prie&s;thood or &s;acrifice; and the independent &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m looks down with contempt on the
<PB N="59" REF="026954_0057_0FD295704CE77F50">mini&s;ters and the &s;laves of &s;uper&s;tition. The voluntary penance of the a&s;cetics, the torment and glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who cen&s;ured in his com|panions a ra&s;h vow of ab&s;taining from fle&s;h, and wo|men, and &s;leep; and firmly declared, that he would &s;uffer no monks in his religion.</P>
<P>"The interdiction of wine, peculiar to &s;ome orders of prie&s;ts or hermits, is converted by Mahomet alone into a po&s;itive and general law; and a con&s;iderable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command, the u&s;e of that &s;alutary, though dangerous liquor. The&s;e pain|ful re&s;traints are, doubtle&s;s, infringed by the libertine and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legi&s;lator, by whom they are enacted, cannot &s;urely be accu&s;ed of alluring his pro&s;elytes by the indulgence of their &s;en|&s;ual appetites. The charity of the Mahometans de|&s;cends to the animal creation; and the Koran repeat|edly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a &s;trict and indi&s;|pen&s;able duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortu|nate. Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the preci&s;e mea&s;ure of charity: the &s;tandard may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it con&s;i&s;ts either in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandi&s;e; but the mu&s;ulman does not accompli&s;h the law, unle&s;s he be&s;tows a <HI>tenth</HI> of his revenue; and if his con&s;cience accu&s;es him of fraud or extortion, the tenth, under the idea of re&s;titution, is enlarged to a <HI>fifth.</HI> Benevolence is the foundation of ju&s;tice, &s;ince we are forbid to injure tho&s;e whom we are bound to a&s;|&s;i&s;t.

Many more extracts, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from this author, who refers to the Koran to &s;hew that the&s;e ex|cellent precepts are enjoined in that work, and religi|ou&s;ly ob&s;erved by mu&s;ulmen, might be made, but we think tho&s;e already adduced are amply &s;ufficient to prove to every unbia&s;&s;ed mind, that the Mahometan e&s;|tabli&s;hment was undoubtedly a very great improve|ment upon the Jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tems. The uni|ty of God is uniformly adhered to, and the great prin|ciples of morality, <HI>the &s;oul of all religion,</HI> is &s;everely in|culcated in every chapter of the Koran. Even admit|ting that the Mahometan religion owed its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, in a great mea&s;ure, to the &s;word, that circum|&s;tance can by no means abridge its merits. We expect that the government of the French republic will be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;word, but it cannot from thence be infered that it will not be equal or &s;uperior to any government on earth. The truth is the Mahometan and Chri&s;tian religion owe their exi&s;tence to per&s;ecu|tion. Mahomet and his followers were per&s;ecuted by the &s;urrounding zelots of former e&s;tabli&s;hments; and, when &s;ufficiently &s;trong, they very wi&s;ely, as all other &s;ects would do, put their confidence in the <HI>ultimo ratio regis.</HI> Perhaps the &s;ole rea&s;on that the Shaking Qua|kers have not made more pro&s;elytes in this country, is becau&s;e no notice has been taken of them, but they have been left to <HI>work out their own &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>The writer thinks his remarks, in the preceding parts of this work, will clear him from the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion of being an advocate for the Mahometan &s;y&s;tem, with all its ab&s;urdities. No, he wi&s;hes to expunge the &s;uperfluities annexed to all religions, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>pure religion of nature,</HI> which alone can ever become
<PB N="61" REF="026954_0059_0FD2957584CD37B0">univer&s;al, and which would di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e national pre|judices by who&s;e influence monarchs have deluged the world in blood. He wi&s;hes to convince chri&s;tians of the impolicy of fo&s;tering prejudices by means of which they have experienced &s;o much contempt and cruelty, from tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite per&s;ua&s;ion. What but religi|ous bigotry could induce the Algerines to treat chri&s;t|ians with &s;uch barbarity? They con&s;ider infidels to their religion intitled to no mercy. The &s;ame cau&s;e has occa&s;ioned the commi&s;&s;ion of equal or &s;uperior cru|elties by chri&s;tians, particularly under the denomina|tion of Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>Perhaps the&s;e acts of inhumanity cannot be fairly ju&s;tified from either of the &s;ources on which the&s;e re|&s;pective religions are founded; but as both con&s;ider all, who are not of their way of thinking, as enemies to God, it is a pre&s;umption that man, as his in&s;trument, has a right to avenge his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We will now return to our chri&s;tian friend the Lay|man, and re&s;ume our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over matters of inferior moment, we come to his commentary on Mo&s;es' account of the fall. Here we think, he has injured his cau&s;e by attempt|ing to elucidate this mi&s;terious &s;ubject. People were in the habit of reading the &s;tory in the allegorical, bi|ble &s;tyle, without attending to its ab&s;urdities; but the moment you tran&s;late it into plain Engli&s;h, it becomes too trifling, too in&s;ignificant for a &s;chool-boy not to ridicule. It belittles the character of the Deity, and to credit it is degrading to his creture, <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>That this idea of heriditary original &s;in was engend|ered in the flighty imagination of fanatics, mu&s;t appear
<PB N="62" REF="026954_0060_0FD2957A0531E138">evident, when we reflect on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God; con&s;equently that man &s;tands in the &s;ame &s;i|tuation he ever did, and will be accountable only for his own actions.</P>
<P>He concludes this article thus, "If the reader con|tinues di&s;&s;atisfied, let him try if he can find or invent any more rational hypothe&s;is to account for the intro|duction of moral evil into our world."</P>
<P>As this is a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t importance, and as we wi&s;h not to incur the imputation of endeavoring to pull down one theory, without &s;ub&s;tituting another, we offer the following ob&s;ervations for the con&s;idera|tion of the reader.</P>
<P>The internal evidence of man's free agency mu&s;t be clear to all who reflect on the operation of their own mind: Were this not the ca&s;e there could be no ac|countability on his part for the commi&s;&s;ion of evil. That man is created with propen&s;ities in favor of vir|tue univer&s;al experience proves; and that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the capability of doing evil nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from his free agency. This is undoubtedly a more noble mode of exi&s;tence than to have been created mere pa&s;&s;ive machines. The greate&s;t difficulty, that occurs, is to reconcile free agency with the pre-&s;cience of Deity. Doct. Beattie, in his e&s;&s;ay on truth, is perfectly &s;atisfactory to the writer on this &s;ubject. He ob&s;erves, it will be uni|ver&s;ally admitted that there are &s;ome things which the Deity cannot do; He cannot deceive, he cannot com|mit evil; the&s;e actions are contrary to the nature of a ju&s;t and holy being, and therefore impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Neither is it more derogatory to the character of the Deity, to &s;ay, there are &s;ome things which he cannot
<PB N="63" REF="026954_0061_0FD2957B03B1DCA0">know; He has made man a free agent, and therefore cannot foreknow the actions he will commit, the one is incon&s;i&s;tent with the other.</P>
<P>It will be objected to this hypothe&s;is, that the Deity, by thus circum&s;cribing him&s;elf, would be liable to have all his plans fru&s;trated by the will of his creatures. What can man, that in&s;ignificant &s;peck in the creation, do towards fru&s;trating the great plans of the omnipo|tent! He may, if he happens to be a monarch, excite wars, and thus occa&s;ion the murder of millions of his fellow men. But can this affect the &s;chemes of the Almighty? certainly not; for the&s;e things take place, and to &s;uppo&s;e God the in&s;tigator of cruelties, is in the highe&s;t degree impious.</P>
<P>By the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity the great author of na|ture is di&s;graced by an imputed partiality to his chil|dren; a partiality which doomed from all eternity, certain individuals to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and others to as durable a puni&s;hment. Every action, &s;ays the Prede&s;tinarian, mu&s;t have been ju&s;t as it was. It was utterly impo&s;&s;ible that Nero &s;hould not murder his mo|ther&mdash;that Richard &s;hould not ma&s;&s;acre his friends and family.&mdash;It was not the will of the man, but the decree of heaven that directed the blow; and the pious Sama|ritan had no more merit from his virtue, than the mo&s;t rapacious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine ob&s;erves, that "the commandments con|tain &s;ome good moral precepts; it is however nece&s;&s;ary to except the declaration which &s;ays, that God vi&s;its the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children. It is con|trary to every principle of moral ju&s;tice." To which our critic replies, "The innocent never &s;uffer for the guilty, except in &s;uch temporal calamities as nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="64" REF="026954_0062_0FD2957D1633EA08">re&s;ult from their parents crimes; as when the po&s;&s;i|gacy of one generation involves the next in poverty, or the like." What latitude he means to give to this phra&s;e, <HI>or the like,</HI> is uncertain. It is clear however that the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents can bear no re&s;emblance to the circum&s;tance he has adduced. Neither can we &s;ee any &s;imilitude in the trifling, childi&s;h fault of Ham; which, if it can be called a crime, de&s;erved, and would have received from a <HI>&s;ober</HI> man of &s;en&s;e, nothing more than a gentle reprimand.</P>
<P>The inhuman cur&s;e pronounced upon Canaan, and his po&s;terity, by his unnatural grand-father, when in a &s;tate of intoxication (by being credited as the word of God) has perhaps been productive of evil, &s;ufficient to over-ballance the good effects attending the introduction of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>It has tended to make a con&s;iderable portion of the human &s;pecies mi&s;erable. Chri&s;tians have the effron|tery to quote this cur&s;e, in ju&s;tification of a traffic, which the benevolent mind contemplates with abhor|rence. Good God, how is thy name perverted to gra|tify the mo&s;t execrable purpo&s;es of avarice and ambition!</P>

It is we be|lieve generally granted that the Chine&s;e date their hi&s;|tory much farther back than the account of the crea|tion, as recorded in the old te&s;tament; but whether the one or the other have any preten&s;ions to probability is, in our opinion, what the Layman is incompetent to determine.</P>

"The &s;acred writers, like other hi&s;torians, are an|&s;werable only for facts, not for their morality. If the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory is &s;trained with blood and cruelty, &s;o is that of all other nations." Very true, but other hi&s;to|rians do not pretend that God commanded tho&s;e cruel|ties which they relate; this con&s;titutes a very material difference. It is but of little con&s;equence at this day to know whether the Jews actually went into the land of Canaan, and committed all the barbarities upon the innocent inhabitants, which their hi&s;tory relates. But it is of the utmo&s;t importance, in order that we gain ju&s;t ideas of the Deity, to know whether he ab&s;olutely headed the Jews, as his cho&s;en people, and commanded them to di&s;tre&s;s another part of his creation with all the mi&s;eries of a mo&s;t cruel, vindictive war. The human mind, unprejudiced by education, &s;hrinks with horror at the idea of calling &s;uch hi&s;tories the word of a ju&s;t and merciful God.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now cite a pa&s;&s;age from our critic as a proof of his candour and credibility, "An evil &s;pirit of God came upon Saul, and he prophe&s;ied," he &s;ays, "is taken from the book of Thomas Paine, who&s;e and who&s;e only is the text and comment."

"And it came to pa&s;s, on the morrow, that the evil &s;pirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophe&s;ied in the mid&s;t of the hou&s;e." See al&s;o chap. xvi. ver. 14, 15.</P>

The &s;cripture however &s;ays, "The De|vil taketh him up, and &s;etteth him on a pinnacle of the temple." But we con&s;ider it of the mo&s;t &s;overeign in|difference, by what way he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken him. The whole &s;tory, that a fallen Angel, who had made a rebellion in heaven, for which he had been con|fined in hell, &s;hould, after this, tempt the Supreme Being to fall down and wor&s;hip him, offering, at the &s;ame time, to give him all the kingdoms of the earth, which the Deity certainly mu&s;t know he had no ju&s;t claim to, is too contemptible for ridicule.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Trinity, our critic ob&s;erves the manner in which the Three are One, or the One is Three, is &s;till a my&s;tery, for it is not known, and perhaps never will be.

<P>It would be difficult to calculate all the <HI>improvements in divine knowledge</HI> that have been made from the days of Adam to the pre&s;ent time. So various and contra|dictory have been the inventions of mankind on this &s;ubject. "They have annihilated the Supreme Being as much as was in their power: they have &s;ometimes made him a globe of fire; &s;ometimes an ox, &s;ometimes a tree, &s;ometimes a man, &s;ometimes a king. They have created God in their own image. They have made him capricious, avaricious, cruel, implacable. They have confined him in heaven as in a palace, and have only invited him on earth to &s;olicit in their favor for tythes, riches, honors, plea&s;ures and power. The real prie&s;t of the Supreme Being is nature; his temple the univer&s;e, his wor&s;hip virtue, his fe&s;tivals the joy of a great people a&s;&s;embled in his pre&s;ence to unite in the mild bonds of univer&s;al fraternity, and to pre&s;ent to him the homage of pure and &s;en&s;ible hearts."</P>
<P>The greate&s;t improvement that now remains to be made in <HI>divine knowledge</HI> is to revive again the &s;imple religion of our fir&s;t parents, the immediate workman&s;hip of God.

<HEAD>A GUIDE TO REASON, BY SAMUEL STILLWELL, IS THE FOURTH ASSAULT UPON THE "FORTRESS OF DEISM."</HEAD>
<P>THIS production may be con&s;idered as a genuine &s;i&s;ter of the Folly of Rea&s;on. For, as in that work, the <HI>beliefs</HI> of the author a&s;&s;ume the place of argument. The greate&s;t merit of this pamphlet is the appearance of a good intention in the writer.</P>
<P>Mr. S. fir&s;t tells us that "The Age of Rea&s;on," is, in his opinion, the offspring of ignorance <HI>concerning</HI> the &s;criptures, though he does not point out in what parti|cular in&s;tance this ignorance appears.</P>
<P>The reading of Mr. S. has been &s;o much confined to Holy Writ, that he &s;uppo&s;es Mr. Paine entirely indebted to that work for the&s;e phra&s;es, "doing ju&s;tice," and "loving mercy."</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts, "It is not found in all the bible, that God puni&s;hes the children for their father's &s;ins, the children being innocent;" Whereas frequent in&s;tances of this kind are mentioned in that book: for example, in Jo&s;hua
<PB N="70" REF="026954_0068_0FD2958DE20C2BD8">vii. 24, 26. we find that for the &s;in of Acham, the &s;on of Zorah, him&s;elf, his &s;ons, daughters, oxen, a&s;&s;es, &s;heep, tent, and all that he had, were burnt.</P>
<P>Mr. S. &s;ays, that within the circle of his acquaintance, he has known an in&s;tance of a Jew's embracing the chri&s;tian religion, and therefore he "<HI>flatly</HI> denies" Mr. Paine's <HI>impious</HI> a&s;&s;ertion that the Jews never credited the &s;tory concerning the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Our author informs us that the practice of "&s;igning wills in the pre&s;ence of two or three witne&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">," is "an example we take from the bible." Which he thinks ought to e&s;tabli&s;h the authenticity of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, "The Lord of the Univer&s;e, in order to teach mankind their duty to God and their fellow-crea|tures, in a <HI>way the mo&s;t ea&s;y to their comprehen&s;ion,</HI> conde|&s;cends to impregnate the womb of a virgin."</P>
<P>Why there was any nece&s;&s;ity of an example of this kind, from the <HI>Lord of the Univer&s;e,</HI> to teach mankind their <HI>duty,</HI> is be&s;t known to the author of the <HI>"Guide to Rea&s;on."</HI></P>
<P>Our knowing one concludes with this whole&s;ome advice "Know thy&s;elf. If you learn this you will &s;ee how <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> the bible is with <HI>your</HI> condition, and how <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> the laws of <HI>our</HI> country are to <HI>our</HI> well-be|ing."&mdash;According to the good old doctrine of nonre|&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;alutary con&s;equences cannot follow to the inhabitants of many parts of Europe, from knowing them&s;elves, we conclude "The Guide to Rea&s;on" was intended and calculated for the &s;mall circle of the author's acquaintance, with a particular reference to his Jew-Chri&s;tian.</P>

<P>In an age, when what has heretofore been con&s;idered as the dreams of philo&s;ophers are about to be acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pli&s;hed, when the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil and religious li|berty, throughout the European world, wears a plea&s;|ing a&s;pect, when degraded man is rea&s;&s;uming his place in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence, and prejudices are vani&s;hing before the eye of rea&s;on, to call this the age of in&s;anity, betrays a want of di&s;cernment or a de&s;ign to mi&s;lead.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves, that, Mr. Paine has re&s;erved this work for an advanced period of his life&mdash;or as Lord Kaime &s;ays of his &s;ketches, "it is the child of his gray hairs." As Kaime's &s;ketches of man is a work of very great me|rit,
<PB N="72" REF="026954_0070_0FD29590E4A28A40">the compari&s;on here in&s;tituted is highly favorable to our author.</P>
<P>He continues, "However unfortunate it is, the fact is undeniable, that men, during the decays of old age and the failure of intellectual faculties, con&s;tantly think them&s;elves growing wi&s;er." Upon another occa&s;ion, when de&s;canting upon the French revolution, wi&s;hing to depreciate the merits of tho&s;e, who&s;e policy and he|roi&s;m have confounded the combined world, by repre|&s;enting them as young, inexperienced madmen, he ob|&s;erves, "In all ages of the world young men have thought old men to be fools: and in all ages, old men have known young men to be fools." So, we &s;ee, this gentleman's &s;entiments can vibrate to either &s;ide of a que&s;tion, as be&s;t &s;uits the particular point, he may wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paine admits a revelation, a word of God, and this is the creation we behold. He goes on to de&s;cribe this word of God; gives a &s;hort account of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, and by the familiar and even vulgar manner of explaining it, it is evident he wrote his <HI>Age of Rea&s;on</HI> for common readers in France and America." Certainly; Mr. Paine, that univer&s;al friend of mankind, writes for the world, he does not wi&s;h to have his works adapted &s;olely to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume the appellation of <HI>learned,</HI> and who&s;e knowledge frequently con&s;i&s;ts in a long catalogue of hard, tecnical terms.&mdash;None but pedants will condemn his writings on this account.</P>
<P>As the remaining pa&s;&s;ages of the Age of Rea&s;on, which are noticed by the Reviewer, have been vindi|cated in the cour&s;e of this work, we pa&s;s on to his ge|neral remarks upon the effects of this publication. "Certain it is, that the tendency of &s;uch books, which
<PB N="73" REF="026954_0071_0FD295922F0F93B0">are indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by certain democrats, is to level Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as well as the monarchies of the earth. We tru&s;t however that the body of the people in America have too much good &s;en&s;e to be deceived, and that they will not exchange good laws, freedom and a pure religion, for the principles of anarchy, and infidelity,"</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over this important di&s;covery and the fright|ful manner in which it is announced to the public, we notice the ba&s;e in&s;inuation by which the author intended to prejudice the minds of the vulgar again&s;t democrats; as tho' they were the only people in the world who had any thing to do with the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on;</HI> as tho' they were all infidels and anarchi&s;ts. Are religious opini|ons, in this, or any other country, a criterion by which to determine political &s;entiments? Is infidelity or de|i&s;m a &s;ure &s;ign of a democrat? Will any man of cha|racter hazard this a&s;&s;ertion? On the contrary, it is a notorious fact that the men of letters and information in France (the clergy not excepted) were almo&s;t univer|&s;ally dei&s;ts, before the revolution. It is al&s;o notorious that the mo&s;t &s;trenuous &s;upporters of the Briti&s;h go|vernment, are at this moment dei&s;ts; notwith&s;tanding their hypocritical pretentions for continuing the pre|&s;ent religious war again&s;t the <HI>infidels</HI> of France. And even the New-York Reviewer him&s;elf has been hereto|fore known to be on the &s;ide of natural religion, altho' he now &s;o zealou&s;ly joins chorus with the weak and de|&s;igning again&s;t <HI>the Age of Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>In America &s;trong religious prejudices have been cultivated in the minds of the people; which has ren|dered circum&s;pection on this point very nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="74" REF="026954_0072_0FD29595327F5288">tho&s;e who were &s;eeking for places of office. The&s;e pre|judices, altho' carefully fo&s;tered by certain illiberal writers, are fa&s;t wearing away. And the doors to ho|nor and power will &s;oon be open to all &s;ects alike.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to "good laws" and "freedom," what have they to do with this &s;ubject? Are not dei&s;ts as peaceable members of &s;ociety, and have they not as ju&s;t ideas of <HI>freedom,</HI> as any other &s;ect? And as to "pure religion" the dei&s;ts, in this point, have certainly the advantage: their religion being perfectly pure, &s;imple and unmixed, its profe&s;&s;ors believing in one God only; whereas the chri&s;tian religion is very complex, its vota|ries acknowledging a God, con&s;i&s;ting of three per&s;ons, one of whom is <HI>part</HI> man.</P>
<P>Thus does this <HI>&s;oi de&s;ant,</HI> E&s;quire, determine the me|rits of all performances, by his &s;cale of politics. If they cla&s;h in the lea&s;t with this, they are immediately de|clared to be Antifederal, Democratical, Jacobinical, Anarchial, &amp;c. &amp;c. This kind of <HI>abracadabra</HI> may have a tendency to amu&s;e the ignorant and weak, but with the &s;en&s;ible part of the community can have no effect.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Reviewer, in his eulogium on a work tending to e&s;tabli&s;h "the genuinene&s;s and authenticity of the new te&s;tament," commences with the following remarks:</P>
<P>"At a time, when a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy and fal&s;e liberty are attempting to break down all the bar|riers which wi&s;dom, divine and human, has rai&s;ed to guard the moral and &s;ocial &s;tate of man from the vio|lence of turbulent pa&s;&s;ions; when Jacobini&s;m in religion and in politics, is aiming to level all authority, human and ditine; to place the young and uniformed above
<PB N="75" REF="026954_0073_0FD2941387363100">the venerable &s;age, and rai&s;e the throne of a capricious rea&s;on on the ruins of chri&s;tianity; it gives us peculiar plea&s;ure to find able champions of our faith among the di&s;tingui&s;hed leterati of our own country."</P>
<P>He might as well tell us of Jacobini&s;m in hu&s;bandry, architecture or navigation, as in religion, the &s;ubjects have no connection. We are furpri&s;ed that this critic has not noticed the Telegraphe, late di&s;covered in France, and condemned it as a Jacobinical invention. We are per&s;uaded that were he acquainted with the political &s;entiments of Mr. Her&s;chel, and found them favorable to the French revolution, he would convert his planet into a member of the Jacobin club.</P>
<P>Thus are all improvements in moral and natural philo&s;ophy, in the arts and &s;ciences, liable to be arraign|ed as Jacobinical inovations. Rea&s;on, which was evi|dently intended by the Creator, as a guide to our acti|ons, is &s;et down as "capricious" and incompetent to the purpo&s;e. We mu&s;t follow blindly the &s;y&s;tems, which chance or de&s;ign has adopted, becau&s;e it is mo&s;t for the convenience of the few, who live upon the cre|dulity of the many.</P>
<P>"We tru&s;t, however, that the body of people in A|merica, have too much good &s;en&s;e to be deceived, and that they will not exchange" their <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for arbitrary &s;y&s;tems, contrary to it, and which of cour&s;e di&s;grace it.</P>
<P>Our Reviewer, at the clo&s;e of his ob&s;ervations on the pamphlet under con&s;ideration, introduces a <HI>new idea</HI> re&s;pecting the mode of wor&s;hip in&s;tituted in France, which <HI>he thinks</HI> of great importance, and &s;eems much plea&s;ed at having been the fir&s;t to make the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>"The French have aboli&s;hed chri&s;tianity, and renewed the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans, by
<PB N="76" REF="026954_0074_0FD2959ED44DFF80">erecting certain virtues, as ju&s;tice, truth, patrioti&s;m, &amp;c. into divinities to be wor&s;hipped, and actually in&s;tituting fe&s;tivals and erecting temples in honor of the&s;e vi&s;ionary, metaphy&s;ical, undefined deities. This was the preci&s;e origin of the pagan idolatry&mdash;the foundation on which the whole &s;y&s;tem of ancient mythology was erected; and out of which grew all its ab&s;urdities and corrup|tions.

<P N="2">2.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the illiberal writer, in your evening paper of Monday, upon the Age of Rea|&s;on and Thomas Paine, &s;carcely de&s;erves notice, he &s;hall not pa&s;s without &s;ome ob&s;ervations from one who is in|timately acquainted with that excellent writer, and his works, which will be read and admired when this de|famer, will be con&s;igned to contempt and oblivion: And I am not a little &s;urprized, that &s;uch a jargon of &s;eandal, fal&s;hood and abu&s;e, again&s;t one of our be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable Patriots, &s;hould find admittance in an American paper.</P>
<P>He &s;ays "this Pamphlet, the Age of Rea&s;on, has been thrown on the public, as a ba&s;tard is laid in the &s;treets, without a typographic dad, or mam, to claim the brat, with an intention to ju&s;tify the title;" this is an impudent and a fooli&s;h fal&s;hood, for Mr. Paine avows <HI>the brat</HI> and has given his name to it.</P>
<P>Mankind have from the fir&s;t of time been going on in improvement, and of con&s;equence it is to be &s;uppo|&s;ed, that by "the <HI>fag end</HI> of the 18th century," &s;ubjects will be more thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and better under|&s;tood, than they were at the <HI>fag end</HI> of the 17th.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of then proceeding to make his &s;trictures up|on the book, he &s;tops to give you the hi&s;tory of its au|thor, which is a mixture of mi&s;repre&s;entation, and fal&s;|hood. Mr. Paine was known in England both as a Pa|triot and a writer, before he came to America, his pub|lication in behalf of the inferior officers of the Revenue, gained him great credit, and many friends, though it

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This mu&s;t mean only a News-paper publication, as Mr. Paine expre&s;sly declares that the work entitled, Common Sen&s;e, was the fir&s;t book he ever publi&s;hed.</HI></NOTE> it was for that and not for the deficiency in his accounts, for he had none, being only a &s;urveyor, that a vile and corrupt government di&s;placed him, and it was Dr. Franklin him&s;elf who was the cau&s;e of his coming to this country. The la&s;t ten lines of this paragraph contain as audacious an untruth, as ever in&s;ulted the public;
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The pa&s;&s;age alluded to is as follows: "It appears moreover that the people of England did not reli&s;h his opini|ons, quite as well as he expected; and that for one of his la&s;t pieces, as de&s;tructive to the peace and happine&s;s of their country, they threatened our knight-errant with &s;uch &s;erious vengeance that, to avaid a trip to Botany-bay, he fled over to France, as a le&s;s dangerous voyage."</HI></NOTE> the truth is Mr. Paine publi&s;hed the &s;econd part of the Rights of Man in Lon|don, and remained many months after in that city. He was then elected a member of the National Conven|tion for two places, he cho&s;e to repre&s;ent Calais, and a deputation was &s;ent to Dover, where he embarked pub|liely at noon day, and the &s;ame deputation accompani|ed him to Paris, where he took his &s;eat.</P>
<P>It is true his &s;ame went before him; it is true he continued his hatred of Kings and tyrants, yet he voted again&s;t the death of Louis 16th&mdash;but his intimacy with Bri&s;&s;ot who tran&s;lated and read his &s;peeches, and who has &s;ince been executed for con&s;piracy, and trea&s;on, was the cau&s;e of his arre&s;tation, and of his being confined in the palace of Luxembourgh in Paris, and not in the Ca&s;tle of Luxembourgh which I &s;uppo&s;e this writer would have us under&s;tand; the remainder of this pa|ragraph is too contemptible for notice.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the&s;e da&s;tardly attacks upon Mr. Paine's political character, can do him little harm among a people who remember his exertions in the cau&s;e of Liberty, and the good effects they produced.</P>

<P>Here we ob&s;erve, this apo&s;tle of "virtue and religi|on," in&s;tead of confuting "the Age of Rea&s;on," pro|po&s;es to traduce the character of its author.</P>
<P>If the advocates of the chri&s;tian religion are reduced to this expedient, it is a &s;hrewd &s;ign that they &s;u&s;pect the weakne&s;s and fallacy of the arguments which are adduced in &s;upport of it. How can "impropriety of conduct," alter the <HI>eternal principles of truth,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in the "Age of Rea&s;on?" The &s;entiments, advanced in that work, mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by their own intrin&s;ic merits.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paine during the American Revolution, by his patriotic writings and &s;ervices, ju&s;tly obtained our
<PB N="82" REF="026954_0080_0FD295A9EA22C610">e&s;teem and applau&s;e."&mdash;Were we as uncharitable as our opponent, we might here ob&s;erve, that this prai&s;e comes from a &s;u&s;pected quarter; as a <HI>certain order</HI> in America were almo&s;t univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed to our Revo|lution, and of cour&s;e to the writings of Thomas Paine on that &s;ubject. Indeed many parts of this addre&s;s tend to confirm our &s;u&s;picions on this point.</P>
<P>"And it was hoped, he having returned to Europe, that we &s;hould ever have had occa&s;ion to have revered his name." Why a per&s;on who "by his patriotic wri|tings and &s;ervices," had ju&s;tly merited &s;o much "e&s;teem and applau&s;e," in America, could not have &s;till been "revered," in this country, without returning to Eu|rope, is be&s;t known to the learned gentleman who makes this remark.</P>
<P>&mdash; "to per&s;uade us to renounce the divine &s;y&s;|tem of chri&s;tianity, which alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e can dignify and ble&s;s human nature, and to embrace his fallacious, gloomy and uncomfortable &s;cheme of dei&s;m." That the chri&s;t|ian religion <HI>dignifies human nature,</HI> is an idea that exi&s;ts only in the flighty imagination of its zealous votaries. &mdash;It &s;ub&s;titutes a man, in the place of the Supreme Be|ing, and directs us to re&s;t in him all our hope of future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;This, in&s;tead of <HI>dig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nature,</HI> is to the la&s;t degree degrading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.&mdash;An exception may be made of a &s;mall portion of the human &s;pecies, who are reputed, by this religion, to hold a commi&s;&s;i|on, immediately from the Almighty to preach &s;alva|tion to mankind, upon this condition, that they acknow|ledge the founder of chri&s;tianity to be the &s;on of God, and that they are his emba&s;&s;adors, and are worthy to be reverenced as &s;uch:&mdash;The&s;e it dignifies at the ex|pence of the degradation of their followers.</P>
<P>&mdash; "it becomes a duty, that the unwary may be pre&s;erved from &s;eduction, to dive&s;t this dei&s;tical en|thu&s;ia&s;t and incendiary of his ma&s;k, and to exhibit him in his genuine character."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to apply language more improperly than is expre&s;&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age before us. Where is the
<PB N="83" REF="026954_0081_0FD295AC51FF7BA0">man on earth, that has appeared more open, more can|did, more intriped and per&s;evering in the cau&s;e of hu|manity, than Thomas Paine? We defy this <HI>immaculate</HI> prelate to name the man.&mdash;Has he not per&s;onally, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k of his life, led the way to the annihilation of prejudices and impo&s;itions, in church and &s;tate, which have di&s;graced and afflicted human nature for ages?&mdash; Has he not openly put his name to the "Rights of Man," and "the Age of Rea&s;on?" To accu&s;e him then of wearing a ma&s;k is the height of pre&s;umption and folly. Be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ir, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to palm upon the Americans, <HI>a ma&s;ked incendiary,</HI> as the "genu|ine character," of Thomas Paine; and that whoever attempts it, will do it, at the expence of their veracity and reputation.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould dei&s;m be the con&s;tant theme of abu&s;e for bigots of all other per&s;ua&s;ions? Have not its pro|fe&s;&s;ors an equal right to the free enjoyment of their re|ligious principles? Are they not as hone&s;t members of &s;ociety, as any other &s;ect? And have they not con&s;i&s;ted of men of the fir&s;t re&s;pectability for talents and pro|bity, in every enlightened country?&mdash;Let the oppo|&s;ers of dei&s;m prove that its doctrine tends to de&s;troy the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.&mdash;Let them prove that the eternal principles of truth can, con&s;i&s;tent with the character of its author, have this effect, then will we renounce our ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, and &s;ub&s;cribe to their "gloomy uncomfortable &s;cheme," of a crucified Saviour.</P>
<P>Knowledge is &s;pread abroad;&mdash;the &s;hackles of &s;uper|&s;tition are broken&mdash;mankind have began to reflect&mdash;the idea of the awfulne&s;s of the &s;ubject, and the profanity of doubting the authenticity of the &s;criptures, will now frighten none but children and dotards.&mdash;If the truth of chri&s;tianity cannot be defended by fair rea&s;oning, it ought not, and cannot be &s;upported in a country, where freedom of &s;peech and writing is allowed. At lea&s;t, if it cannot be made to appear that it has a better effect on &s;ociety than dei&s;m, the &s;y&s;tem, with the fables that gave ri&s;e to it, mu&s;t &s;ail, and be no more heard of, ex|cept
<PB N="84" REF="026954_0082_0FD295ADCD958618">as we now relate the &s;tories of witches, to &s;hew the credulity and ignorance of former ages.</P>
<P>That a religion, which naturally excites &s;o much en|thu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;which has cau&s;ed &s;o many cruel wars, and con&s;equent mi&s;ery to mankind, will not, upon fair in|ve&s;tigation, be thought preferable in effects to the mild, unpa&s;&s;ionate religion of nature, is evident. We there|fore expect the gradual ri&s;e of dei&s;m upon the ruins of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and advi&s;e all &s;ectaries to prepare their minds for this event.</P>
<P>Dei&s;m will con&s;equently introduce modes of wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;tent with the character of <HI>rea&s;onable beings.</HI></P>
<P>Temples of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> will &s;ucceed temples of &s;uper&s;ti|tion; lectures on moral philo&s;ophy and other u&s;eful &s;ubjects will then be delivered from the pulpit. Man|kind will be taught, that to be happy, and to make each other &s;o here, is their only duty: and that this will in|&s;ure their eternal happine&s;s hereafter. This doctrine will take place of <HI>faith, mi&s;tery, miracle,</HI> and <HI>prophecy:</HI> And thus a &s;eventh part of the time be profitably, and agrecably &s;pent, which is now &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of bigotry and folly.</P>
<P>Many of the clergy, no doubt, would give their hearty a&s;&s;ent for the introduction of this &s;y&s;tem; but it would not an&s;wer their purpo&s;e to propo&s;e it: the refor|mation mu&s;t be gradually effected by enlightening the minds of the people.</P>
<P>We &s;hall omit any farther remarks till the appear|ance of Mr. Ogden's propo&s;ed publication.</P>
<P>To conclude, the writer &s;olemnly declares, that the happine&s;s of mankind are his views, in wi&s;hing to pro|pagate dei&s;m; he has the charity to believe that chri&s;t|ians are in general influenced by the &s;ame motives: He wi&s;hes not to per&s;ecute, nor wound the feelings of any, but to convince by fair argumentation.</P>
