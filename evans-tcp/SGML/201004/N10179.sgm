<P>THE intention of the publication before you, be|ing to vindicate a cau&s;e which has been a princi|pal object of your attention, has a con&s;equent claim to your patronage, I &s;hall therefore make no apology for in&s;cribing it to you.

I am under no per&s;onal obligations to you&mdash;the gratitude I feel ari&s;es from a nobler &s;ource&mdash; it is a ju&s;t tribute to that generous di&s;intere&s;ted exertion of benevolence and philanthropy, which has been the principal means of heaping wealth and honours on Euro|peans and Americans, and re&s;cuing many millions of wretched Africans, as <HI>brands from the fire,</HI> and even compelling them to the enjoyment of a more refined &s;tate of happine&s;s, than the partiality of fate had a&s;&s;igned them in their native &s;tate.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well ob&s;erved by &s;ome author I have read, that the be&s;t human in&s;titutions partake of imperfection; and the mo&s;t excellent con&s;titution has its defects.&mdash; The liberty of the pre&s;s has doubtle&s;s &s;ome advantages; but it may be que&s;tioned whether the&s;e outweigh its in|conveniencies. We may certainly reckon among the latter, the opportunities with which it furni&s;hes <HI>weak</HI> men of venting the idle dreams of a di&s;tempered brain; or de&s;igning ones of carrying on their dark purpo&s;es, by mi&s;repre&s;entation, &s;lander, or other mi&s;chievous means. Had it not been for this unre&s;trained liberty of the pre&s;s, the ta&s;k I have undertaken would have been probably needle&s;s; and I had been &s;pared the di&s;tre&s;s which at|tends me, in being obliged to expo&s;e my poor abilities to the publick view. Confiding however in its candour, I will not increa&s;e my claim on its patience by a long preface. I will only &s;ay, that in gratitude to the author of "<HI>Slavery not forbidden by &s;cripture,</HI> &amp;c." I have endea|voured to adopt this plan &s;o fully, that the following pages may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a &s;econd edition of that celebrated work, with &s;ome corrections, tran&s;po&s;itions, and emendations.</P>

<HEAD>PERSONAL SLAVERY ESTABLISHED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING attentively peru&s;ed &s;everal of the late publications on the &s;ubject of per&s;onal Slavery, I think it may not be ami&s;s if I &s;tate, in a &s;ummary way, the arguments adduced in them for and again&s;t the prac|tice; and draw &s;uch conclu&s;ions, as may be warranta|ble from the premi&s;es. The fir&s;t on the &s;ubject, which I &s;hall notice, is a pamphlet intitled,</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;iderations on keeping Negroes, &amp;c. by John Woolman.</HI> As his arguments again&s;t the practice are all drawn from the Old and New Te&s;tament, and their authority has been long &s;ince rejected by &s;ome of our mo&s;t prevailing &s;y&s;tems of politicks, I think it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more, than that it appears to be the dull productions of a vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;t.&mdash;The next work in my catalogue, is</P>
<P><HI>A &s;hort account of that part of Africa inhabited by the Ne|groes, &amp;c.</HI> The author or compiler of this work has taken great pains to convince us, that he concurs with a number of other authors in condemnation of the Slave-trade, as unju&s;t, cruel, and impolitic; and to &s;upport
<PB N="8" REF="012935_0005_0F903F2E0772A590">
their opinions, relates a number of what he would &s;up|po&s;e are facts. Now as tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed facts con&s;titute the foundation of mo&s;t of his arguments, if they are remo|ved little need be &s;aid to prove his opinions to be idle and nugatory. Tho&s;e facts are generally the relations of men, who are, or have been concerned or employed in the trade to Africa for Slaves, un&s;upported by a &s;ingle affidavit, or any other <HI>legal</HI> proof of their authority; and moreover men &s;peaking in a cau&s;e in which they are parties; and therefore cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to tell the <HI>whole</HI> truth, even could we &s;uppo&s;e what they have told is truth. I could produce numberle&s;s authorities from our law books, to prove that no evidence can be admitted but what is well e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>on oath,</HI> and that all offered by parties to the matter in di&s;pute, mu&s;t be rejected. Such is the law, and the law being allowed to be the perfection of rea&s;on, it follows that the arguments of our author on the &s;ubject of &s;lavery, are not only unrea&s;onable, but al|&s;o illegal, and therefore inadmi&s;&s;able.&mdash;Proceed we there|fore to con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>A caution and warning to Great-Britain and her colonies, &amp;c. by Ant. Benezet.</HI> I will promi&s;e that on a particular enquiry, I have found that this gentleman has no Ne|groes, and no concern in trade. We can therefore be at no difficulty in accounting for a certain contraction of &s;entiment, evident in his ab&s;tract ideas of right and wrong. They are merely theoretick, and a little acquain|tance with men and things would convince him, are better calculated for the amu&s;ement of reclu&s;e bigots, than the attention of men endued with a more liberal turn of thinking, and enlarged ideas. The general ar|guments he has made u&s;e of, are &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the la&s;t mentioned piece, that the objections I have advanced
<PB N="9" REF="012935_0006_0F903F2F5143EFE8">
in con&s;idering <HI>that,</HI> are al&s;o applicable to this. The ex|tract of a &s;ermon preached by the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, which he has pre&s;umptuou&s;ly tacked to the end of his pamphlet, is &s;uch an ab&s;urd rhap&s;ody, as in le&s;s corrupt times would have deprived the Bi&s;hop of his See. Per|haps it has been tenderly winked at, as owing to that inten&s;e application, which at the time that it opened the trea&s;ures of knowledge to his view, ob&s;cured his facul|ties in u&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The next piece on the &s;ubject, which I have met with, is <HI>an addre&s;s to the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in America, upon Slave-keeping, &amp;c.</HI> As this piece is par|ticularly animadverted on in a judicious and very candid defence of the practice in general, and particularly of the We&s;t-India planters from the calumnies it contains, I &s;hall &s;tate the &s;um of the arguments from each, toge|ther. This la&s;t tract is entitled,</P>
<P><HI>Slavery not forbidden by Scripture; or, a Defence of the We&s;t-India planters from the a&s;per&s;ions, &amp;c. by a We&s;t-Indi|an.</HI> As the author's place of re&s;idence was &s;uch, as mu&s;t afford him the be&s;t opportunities of being well acquaint|ed with his &s;ubject; and it does not appear from the ti|tle page, that he had any concern in the &s;lave trade, nor had reaped any advantage from the labour of &s;laves, we cannot he&s;itate in giving his &s;entiments their due weight, in oppo&s;ition to all that has been advanced again&s;t Slavery, by men who have not had his opportunities. From the ob&s;ervations I have already made, I have left but little room to doubt which &s;ide of the que&s;tion I e&s;pou&s;e; and it will appear further evident from tho&s;e I may make, as in expre&s;&s;ing my &s;entiments of the addre&s;s I &s;hall be apt, very frequently to u&s;e the words of the Defence, in adopt|ing
<PB N="10" REF="012935_0007_0F903F2FD857D3A8">
this method, I hope I &s;hall not incur the charge of plagiari&s;m, as I believe the e&s;&s;ence of that crime con&s;i&s;ts in borrowing from an author without confe&s;&s;ing the debt. The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the Addre&s;s not only as it relates to Slavery, but al&s;o as a mo&s;t &s;candalous and audacious libel on <HI>every</HI> in|dividual inhabitant of <HI>every</HI> i&s;land in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The author of the Addre&s;s, pretending to aim at the reformation of mankind, points out the practice of per|&s;onal Slavery, as one particular that <HI>he</HI> thinks requires it, and recommends the adoption of a plan that he opines would be likely to aboli&s;h it, never giving him&s;elf time to con&s;ider our natural frailties&mdash;the impo&s;&s;ibility of ab|&s;olute perfection&mdash;that there are faults in every human in&s;titution, and that till &s;elf-intere&s;t cea&s;es to have influ|ence over the actions of men, propo&s;als that &s;trike at the very root of their temporal intere&s;ts&mdash;their ea&s;e&mdash; their convenience and grandeur, will never be li&s;tened to. He might as well have poured forth his eloquence again&s;t the lawle&s;s ambition of Kings in &s;acrificing millions of their fellow creatures&mdash;the knavery of State&s;men&mdash;the avarice of Bi&s;hops, Lawyers, Phy&s;icians and Merchants &mdash;the endle&s;s endeavours of men univer&s;ally to overreach one another, and the continued &s;cene of blood&s;hed and cru|elty exhibited by mo&s;t of our favourite &s;ports; all which it is evident, from his not mentioning them, he &s;ecretly approves; I &s;ay, he might as well have poured forth his eloquence on all or any of the&s;e, as exerci&s;e his declama|tory powers on Slavery. A man of a liberal and benevo|lent way of thinking, would have &s;een that they are all but the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the imperfection of our nature; and that his lei&s;ure hours might have been bet|ter employed, than in railing at &s;lavery, which at the
<PB N="11" REF="012935_0008_0F903F323AAD7FE8">
wor&s;t cannot be &s;aid to &s;acrifice millions for &s;o trifling a pittance as a &s;mall &s;pot of land.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;er ab&s;urdly endeavours to prove from &s;crip|ture, that the Slavery tolerated by the Mo&s;aic law, was e&s;&s;entially different from that now impo&s;ed on the Afri|cans; and gives &s;ome rea&s;ons (as &s;pecious as he can make them) to convince us they might have particular rea&s;ons for the kind of &s;lavery they did tolerate. He might as well have inferred that if the advocates for Slavery, ju&s;|tify the practice under that law; the other parts of it, in every particular, are &s;till obligatory; and although &s;ub|jecting us to &s;ome inconvenient ceremonies, would give us a title to many valuable priviledges, as turning off a wi&s;e we might be tired of, &amp;c. &amp;c. But as I ob&s;erved at &s;etting out, the authority of &s;cripture is now general|ly rejected by men of a liberal way of thinking. I &s;hall therefore be more brief on any arguments drawn from it on either &s;ide, and confine my&s;elf to &s;uch, as in my own opinion, are rea&s;onable and in point. Is it not highly probable that the Africans we en&s;lave, are de&s;cendants of the very &s;ame Heathen that were <HI>round about</HI> the I&s;|raelites, who we all know lived a long time in Africa? If &s;o, as they &s;till remain unconverted, are they not yet in the &s;ame predicament with their ance&s;tors? And as, without much arrogance we may e&s;teem our&s;elves as I&s;|raelites, or at lea&s;t de&s;cended from them, will it be de|nied that we are entitled to the liberty of en&s;laving the Africans and the Heathen <HI>round about</HI> us al&s;o? This la&s;t is a trade we might drive on with very little &s;hipping, and may be worthy of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Our author, in attempting to prove the incon&s;i&s;tency of Slavery under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, is quite
<PB N="12" REF="012935_0009_0F903F33872D3438">
bla&s;phemous. He would infer that although there is no <HI>expre&s;s</HI> precept again&s;t the Slave-trade to Africa or keep|ing Slaves; they are both ab&s;olutely repugnant to the very genius and &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity. Ju&s;t as if we were to imagine any evil was intended to be removed that was not expre&s;sly forbidden in the New-Te&s;tament. This would be to &s;uppo&s;e that the lawle&s;s ambition of Kings &s;acrificing millions of their fellow creatures, and the lit|tle catalogue of other nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the im|perfection of our nature, before mentioned, are incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the Chri&s;tian religion. How ab&s;urd is &s;uch rea|&s;oning? How impious its author! 'Tis well he is not within the reach of a Popi&s;h inqui&s;ition; he certainly would have made a principle character in an <HI>Auto de fe.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his ab&s;urdities, and his being totally unacquainted with the &s;ubject, I admit his arguments have &s;ome weight in the&s;e northern colonies. Truth and ju&s;tice &s;hould have very di&s;tinct ideas annexed to them at the pole, from what they convey under the equi|noctial. There is a certain <HI>political nece&s;&s;ity</HI> by which tho&s;e ideas &s;hould be regulated; and as this nece&s;&s;ity may be very different in different latitudes, a practice may be meritorious in the We&s;t-Indies, which in Canada is far otherwi&s;e. Had our author and his a&s;&s;ociates confined their &s;lander to their own countrymen, and <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> ex|cepted the We&s;t-Indians from any &s;hare in them, I &s;hould have had no objection to the di&s;play of their abilities. He certainly never con&s;idered that the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, hold to the value of &pound;. 22,000,000 in live &s;tock, exclu&s;ive of quadrupeds and other chattels; and that were his pernicious doc|trines, (which thus impiou&s;ly exclude the idea of poli|tical nece&s;&s;ity) to prevail, they might &s;oon be twenty-two millions of money poorer than they now e&s;teem
<PB N="13" REF="012935_0010_0F903F3499FD3A90">
them&s;elves to be.&mdash;Rum, Sugar, Rice and Indigo are indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;aries of life, and if we exclude Ne|groes, we mu&s;t introduce white men in their cultivation, which would never an&s;wer; for they could not &s;u&s;tain the labour as well as blacks, as this author him&s;elf is plea&s;ed, with unu&s;ual candour, to allow; and perhaps it might be rather difficult (e&s;pecially if they were Bri|tons) to per&s;uade them to &s;ubmit, to what their ma&s;ters might think a proper correction in compelling them to it. The ob&s;tinacy of their tempers might occa&s;ion an exertion of &s;pirit in the ma&s;ters, that would &s;ometimes bring the lives of the latter as well as the former into &s;ome danger, as without doubt it would happen now and then, that a &s;urviving fellow &s;ervant might be hardy enough to inform, and claim the vengeance of the laws, which in the ca&s;e of white men, may not be &s;uffered to remain as they now are. Be&s;ides this, there would be a danger that indu&s;trious &s;ervants would frequently become ma&s;ters; and if this ever happened in the &s;ugar colonies, and they were not able to make fifty hog&s;heads of &s;ugar each; by joining in the expence, they might obviate the difficulties ari&s;ing from the great expence of &s;ugar-works; for it appears it is no more worth while to erect proper works for the manufacture of any le&s;s quantity, than it would be in a wheat country, for every petty farmer to build a mill for the grinding his own grain. By &s;uch means in time the great e&s;tates of the We&s;t-Indians would be divided, and many families, who by hone&s;t indu&s;try have ri&s;en to affluence, could ri&s;e no <HI>higher.</HI> This would probably di&s;courage that profu&s;ion of ex|pence, for which the We&s;t-Indians have been always remarkable, and which has been &s;o advantageous to the Mother Country, a con&s;ideration highly worthy of at|tention; even if by &s;uch a divi&s;ion of e&s;tates, the reve|nues
<PB N="14" REF="012935_0011_0F903F34C38FE938">
of government were not le&s;&s;ened, which would cer|tainly be the ca&s;e if the number of <HI>whites</HI> was increa&s;ed, who would undoubtedly con&s;ume more among them&s;elves. Now the quantity of We&s;t-India produce does not only benefit Britain in re&s;pect to the revenue, but the Sugar, &amp;c. &s;ent home, by giving employment to the refiners of Sugar, &s;ailors, &s;hip-builders, &amp;c. al&s;o <HI>creates</HI> an increa&s;e of its inhabitants; whether by any prolific, or what other quality in the Sugar, &amp;c. I cannot tell; but &s;uch is the fact, as I am informed by the <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>Was government &s;ufficiently &s;tupid to li&s;ten to the com|plaint of the author of the <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates, or any &s;uch vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and proclaim liberty to <HI>four hundred</HI> thou&s;and Negroes, who are &s;aid to be in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands only, it is mo&s;t probable that near <HI>four</HI> thou&s;and gentlemen Chri&s;tians, and among them &s;ome of the riche&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, would be immediately re|duced to a mo&s;t calamitous &s;ituation&mdash;would be obliged to content them&s;elves with what they have already &s;o equitably acquired by their labour; and one hundred times that number of poor &s;tupid Negroes would be turn|ed adrift, and forever after deprived of <HI>their</HI> kind care and protection. What an unchri&s;tian conduct would this be? I am really quite tired of this writers ab&s;urdi|ties; nor le&s;s &s;hocked at his want of humanity.</P>
<P>Had he and his a&s;&s;ociates confined them&s;elves to the &s;uppo&s;ed propriety of prohibiting the African trade in ge|neral terms, I &s;hould not have felt the lea&s;t de&s;ire of com|batting their opinions. But he has repre&s;ented the We&s;t-India Planters as a &s;et of hardened mon&s;ters; or at lea&s;t that many cruel puni&s;hments are inflicted on their Slaves by <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them. He little thinks I can trace mo&s;t of
<PB N="15" REF="012935_0012_0F903F35DD2ABC60">
his malicious hints to the identical per&s;ons he aims at. Does he idly imagine that there is any difficulty in &s;eeing that the &s;yringe of his venom is principally levelled again&s;t the Hon. Mr. &mdash; of Bar&mdash;s, John &mdash;, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of An|t&mdash;a, Mr. &mdash; of St. K&mdash;s,&mdash;a certain Honourable and worthy gentleman of Jam&mdash;ca, who commonly wears blue cloaths, &amp;c. &amp;c. I could point out &s;everal others who are evidently the particular objects of his &s;lander, were I &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; but the&s;e are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the pub|lic, that his reflections are altogether <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> and that his <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> is written &s;olely with a de&s;ign to &s;pread them. As to his particular in&s;tances of barbarity, he does not mention one that is well &s;upported by proof, and we can|not admit the po&s;&s;ibility of the facts, as the author of the <HI>Defence</HI> a&s;&s;ures us <HI>he</HI> never was an eye-witne&s;s of one &s;in|gle in&s;tance as particularized in the <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. and yet with a candour that is ever the companion of truth, he does allow a <HI>few</HI> in&s;tances of the kind mentioned, had happened. One or two more of the&s;e fanatic writers ad|duce authorities for &s;ome of their a&s;&s;ertions of this &s;ort. I would not offer to impeach the credit of Sir Hans Sloan, but he was certainly a milky tempered man, who&s;e mind was not properly impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of the <HI>political nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a conduct to keep &s;laves in <HI>proper</HI> awe; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, I think as he had received civilities from many gentlemen in Jamaica, and con&s;iderable additions were there made to his collection of natural curio&s;ities, his character as a <HI>gentleman</HI> would have &s;hone quite as con&s;picuou&s;ly, had he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of his reflections on their behaviour to their &s;laves.&mdash;The de&s;erving part of the Negroes will maintain their good behaviour, and

the worthle&s;s from motives of fear take care <HI>never to me|rit</HI> puni&s;hment; &s;o that the little &s;everity commonly u&s;ed among them is <HI>unmerited</HI> and merely <HI>in Terrorem.</HI> But when they are faulty, and you omit correction, they will &s;urely <HI>laugh</HI> heartily at your folly. If you are fooli&s;h enough to be indulgent and ea&s;y with them, they will not only exerci&s;e their ri&s;ible faculties, but become com|pleat villains; and the chances are ten to one that your particular favourites are the ringleaders in every in&s;urrec|tion. Notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;uch is their clemency and forbearance, that the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties are in|flicted on any one who cha&s;ti&s;es a Negroe without ac|quainting the proprietor, or if he &s;hould unluckily be in England, why then rather than you &s;hould be <HI>laughed</HI> at (which we all know is very provoking) a formal complaint to his Manager, who is always or <HI>generally</HI> a gentleman by birth or education, will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. The whip with which the driver always follow the Negroes while at their work, is only carried as a badge of autho|rity, and &s;o little u&s;ed, that like Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's &s;ceptre, it may be handed down to &s;ucceeding generati|ons.</P>
<P>Another objection of our &s;agacious <HI>Addre&s;&s;or</HI> is point|ed at the &s;everity of the laws in the &s;outhern colonies and i&s;lands, re&s;pecting Negroes.

Thus the <HI>looming</HI> of the fogs of ig|norance, when di&s;pelled by the winds of <HI>political nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> will no more deceive us.&mdash;The di&s;proportion of whites and blacks is there very great; and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, that fir&s;t and ruling principle of human nature, has made them jealous and <HI>perhaps</HI> &s;evere in their laws, but they are but mere <HI>threats</HI> as it were, and only held up, as the drivers whip, to intimidate delinquents. They are found to be e&s;&s;ential in the very <HI>being</HI> of tho&s;e colonies. Is it not &s;trange that tho&s;e thunder headed &s;cribblers cannot view them through the medium of this political nece&s;&s;ity on which I have &s;o clearly in&s;i&s;ted?&mdash;Slaves are never <HI>capitally</HI> puni&s;hed but for the mo&s;t flagrant crimes, nor condemned without the cleare&s;t proof; nay, &s;uch is their tenderne&s;s on this head, that I have known a humane gentleman frequently to conceal the mo&s;t attrocious crime, rather than &s;uffer the unhappy perpetrator to be puni&s;hed with <HI>death.</HI> To &s;uppo&s;e that ma&s;ters would choo&s;e to forfeit their &s;ervice forever, which is the unde|niable con&s;equence of a <HI>capital</HI> puni&s;hment, would be to prove them de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e as well as compa&s;|&s;ion. In &s;ome ca&s;es we allow &s;laves have been burnt or gibited alive, but neither of the&s;e modes of puni&s;hment, nor any other <HI>ever</HI> u&s;ed among them, can come under the idea of &s;everity, it we reflect on what Ravailac, Damien, and others have &s;uffered for murdering, or attempting to murder Kings, or even that <HI>cruel</HI> I&s;raeliti&s;h practice of boreing the ear of a Slave with an awl, and obliging him to do all his work <HI>fa&s;tened</HI> in that &s;hocking manner to a door po&s;t, which 'tis probable he was obliged to drag after him, when he had occa&s;ion to move.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012935_0015_0F903F39AC763F78">The charge of &s;tarving their Slaves is as groundle&s;s, and may as ea&s;ily be refuted.

<P>It is very evident that notwith&s;tanding the accounts of fabulous voyagers, the Negroes on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa, are the mo&s;t &s;tupid, bea&s;tly race of animals in human &s;hape, of any in the whole world.

which I would di&s;tingui&s;h the la&s;t as only a <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of that <HI>genus,</HI> though utterly devoid of rea&s;on. Carrying this idea a little further, I would yet &s;ubdivide the Africans into five <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> aranging them in the order as they ap|proach neare&s;t to rea&s;on, as 1&s;t, Negroes, 2d, Ourang Outangs, 3d, Apes, 4th, Baboons, and 5th, Monkeys. The opinion of their irrationality is &s;o well &s;upported by <HI>facts,</HI> that to tho&s;e acquainted with them, I need ad|vance very little on the &s;ubject; but to remove every &s;cruple from the &s;ceptic, a little undeniable evidence may not be improper.&mdash;There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than <HI>white;</HI> nor ever any indivi|dual eminent either in action or &s;peculation that was not rather inclining to the <HI>fair.</HI> Africa, except a &s;mall part of it, inhabited by tho&s;e of our own colour, is totally overrun with Barbari&s;m&mdash;nay &s;uch is the contaminating influence of black, that I fear I need not except <HI>even</HI> the <HI>whites</HI> among <HI>them.</HI> Perhaps this ob&s;ervation may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in accounting for the few appearances of Barbari&s;m we now and then di&s;cover among the <HI>whites</HI> in our &s;outhern colonies and i&s;lands, where <HI>blacks</HI> bear &s;o large a propor|tion to their number. But to proceed from this &s;hort di|gre&s;&s;ion, Africa has no kingdoms of any eminence, but chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of petty monarchies, excepting Bildulge|rid, Ethiopia, Nubia, Abi&s;&s;inia, Morocco, and many others that are rather large. That they are <HI>all</HI> perpetually at war with each other, we are well a&s;&s;ured, for it is cer|tainly the ca&s;e with all the petty nations, that are not ve|ry di&s;tant from our European factories on their we&s;tern coa&s;ts, from the river Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope; the Hottentots, Ferlys and &s;ome few others, only ex|cepted.

Let not any in an&s;wer to what I have &s;aid relating to their govern|ments and wars, object the &s;imilarity of de&s;cription given by Tacitus and other hi&s;torians, of many European na|tions in early ages. Such an objection can have no weight, when we con&s;ider the Europeans are ble&s;&s;ed with rea&s;on, and therefore capable of improvement. Be&s;ides the de&s;criptions of this kind are made by Roman authors, who generally gave an exaggerated picture of the manners of any people with whom they were at war, and e&s;peci|ally if they had any particular de&s;igns on them, or to en|&s;lave them or any thing el&s;e for which they could pretend no ju&s;t authoity, for &s;uch repre&s;entations might afford them &s;ome excu&s;e for their lawle&s;s ambition. This fur|ni&s;hes us too, with another &s;trong rea&s;on for di&s;crediting abundance of idle tales, on which the arguments of the&s;e gloomy oppugners of Slavery are founded, as I have before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I could never perceive the Africans have the mo&s;t di&s;|tant notions of a &s;upreme being, which had they any ra|tional powers, they would certainly have either by intu|ition, or the benefit of the connection which tho&s;e near our factories e&s;pecially mu&s;t have with abundance of <HI>pi|ous</HI> white people, who&s;e lawful concerns carrying them into Africa, we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;pare no opportunities of benefitting them in any &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">. In the conver&s;ation of the&s;e, the Negroes would frequently hear imprecations,

that would communicate the <HI>notion</HI> of the whites on this &s;ubject. They have, however, a confu&s;ed notion of an evil &s;pirit called <HI>Jumbee,</HI> who is able to do them mi&s;chief, and it is a cu&s;tom among them to hang a broken bottle, a bit of rag, or any thing el&s;e by way of charm near their ground, which they call <HI>Oby,</HI> and is I &s;uppo&s;e their good &s;pirit. When their property is thus guarded, few Ne|groes will have the boldne&s;s to &s;teal any part of it. How &s;uch irrationals came by even &s;o much religion is hard to find, except we may be allowed a conjecture that they have a faint notion of image wor&s;hip; borrowed proba|bly from Roman itinerant Mi&s;&s;ionaries, as I think Baretti tells us that among the Catholicks, when any indecency is intended in the pre&s;ence of a picture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> or Madona, a cloth is carefully placed before the picture to conceal &s;uch indecency from their view. They al&s;o make &s;ome little &s;hew of religion at their funerals, but this too may be well attributed to imitation; and we may a&s;&s;ign the &s;ame cau&s;e, if we di&s;cover any thing like &s;entiments of friend&s;hip, gratitude, or other &s;ocial ties among them.&mdash; In arts and &s;ciences, they have never made the lea&s;t pro|gre&s;s, which is another &s;trong proof of their brutality. In their mu&s;ic, although there &s;eems to be a kind of di&s;|cordant harmony, I have never been able to di&s;cover their having any notion of the <HI>gamut;</HI> neither have they adopted our be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of a&s;tronomy. When did we ever hear of a Caractacus or a Newton, a Boadicea or a Con|fucius exi&s;ting in Africa. It is true hi&s;tory informs us that it once had a Hannibal, a Ptolemy and a Hippar|chus, but then there is no po&s;itive proof of their being <HI>natives</HI> of it.&mdash;The author of the addre&s;s has attempted to prove they have &s;ome <HI>genius.</HI> I will be candid enough to allow there have been &s;urprizing in&s;tances of <HI>docility</HI> in

Negroes. Such for in&s;tance was that of a Negroe fellow in Jamaica, who &s;eemed to have &s;ome parts and learning, and could talk in a manner, that had his colour been concealed, and he had &s;tuck a piece of wax on his no&s;e to make it a little more prominent, might have been mi&s;ta|ken for a rational creature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a tolerable knowledge in the law. I have my&s;elf &s;een &s;everal Negroes, who by dint of great labour and attention in their owners, have become very good mechanicks, as jewellers, watch-ma|kers, &amp;c. Nay I have known more than one of them who were capable of keeping a &s;et of books in the Italian method in a neat correct manner. But we are not to &s;uppo&s;e a few &s;uch in&s;tances, or that a mere <HI>Lu&s;us Natu|rae</HI> can add any &s;trength to the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being endued with rea&s;on. We all know that extraordinary in&s;tances of docility in brutes have naturally excited great admiration in all ages. Pliny and many others have giv|en us &s;urprizing relations of this kind, and I have been told when a boy, of an elephant in Africa following the occupation of a tinker with &s;ome reputation. The inge|nuity of mechanicks have al&s;o furni&s;hed us with occa&s;ions of wonder in imitations of divers kinds; for in&s;tance, the inanimate flying eagle at Vienna&mdash;the crowing cock at Stra&s;burg&mdash;the &s;peaking clock in Ireland, and abun|dance more, which &s;ufficiently prove the ingenuity of Europeans, but do by no means convince us that the &s;aid eagle, cock and clock were rational beings. Indeed what we are told of ingenuity in Negroes, has &s;ometimes a lit|tle &s;taggered my hypothe&s;is; and would induce a &s;u&s;picion of their mother's fidelity, was not the whole race of them &s;o extremely forbidding in their per&s;ons; and the antipa|thy of all the <HI>whites</HI> to them and their de&s;cendants &s;o un|conquerable, as entirely to &s;atisfy me on that head. The

probability of the fal&s;ity of &s;uch relations, or of their be|ing much exaggerated to gratify a natural fondne&s;s for the marvellous and wonderful, is much more in its fa|vour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Addre&s;&s;er</HI> endeavours to convince us that Negroes pine and degenerate in the i&s;lands. It is evidently other|wi&s;e; for when an e&s;tate there is &s;old, much higher pri|ces are given for their two footed &s;tock born in the We&s;t-Indies, than for tho&s;e imported from Africa.&mdash;Would this wi&s;e acre him&s;elf give as much for a hor&s;e which had not been broke to the &s;hafts or &s;addle, as for one that had tho&s;e advantages? Surely not.</P>
<P>He then goes on with his objections to the method of carrying on the Slave-trade. The rea&s;ons I &s;ugge&s;ted in my ob&s;ervations on the pamphlets I fir&s;t took notice of, preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of my enlarging on this particular point. It is very plain that Slaves are bought in a <HI>fair</HI> cour&s;e of trade; and even could he prove that it is not in the cour&s;e of a <HI>fair</HI> trade, it would be nothing to the purpo&s;e&mdash;if a commodity, a cow for in&s;tance, is brought to me for &s;ale, is it my bu&s;ine&s;s to enter with a critical nicety, into an enquiry by what means the &s;eller procured her? I am &s;ure if I did, I &s;hould forfeit all preten&s;ions to the character of a gentlemen; and I am as confident, that <HI>whatever</HI> the means are, by which &s;laves are brought among us, or whether their &s;ervitude in the We&s;t-Indies is voluntary or not; or even if I &s;hould admit all the accounts of the villainies and cruelties practi&s;ed in the trade were &s;hort of the truth, I &s;hould yet be ju&s;tified in the purcha&s;e of them, as it is a mo&s;t certain introduction to health and happine&s;s in a &s;ituation, where they have fewer cares, and le&s;s anxiety about to-morrow, than any people in the whole

world. They have (in a general way however) their u&s;ual allowance of provi&s;ions, and are entirely exempted from all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es attendant on war. The Negroe it is true, cannot ea&s;ily change his ma&s;ter, but to make amends for this &s;light inconvenience, he enjoys a &s;ingular advantage over his brother in freedom of being <HI>carefully</HI> attended in &s;ickne&s;s, and of having the &s;ame provi&s;ion in old age as in youth. In&s;tead of being oppre&s;&s;ed to feed a large family, like the free comfortle&s;s labourers in Europe, the more children he has, the richer he becomes; for the moment a child is born, the happy parents receive as much addi|tional provi&s;ion, as with their own allowance, will amount to <HI>more</HI> than they can eat; and in ca&s;e of their own death, (if by living among <HI>whites,</HI> they &s;hould chance to have attained any thing like reflection) they will quit the world with the comfortable certainty of their children being brought up with the <HI>&s;ame</HI> kind care, they formerly experienced them&s;elves. What Philo&s;o|pher, Epicurean or Stoick, could wi&s;h for more? In the&s;e i&s;lands and colonies only, do the highly favoured Africans realize the fabulous hi&s;tory of the golden age. Was their happy &s;tate but known in Great-Britain and Ireland&mdash;what emigrations there would be in &s;earch of this terre&s;trial ely&s;ium? Acts of Parliament would then be really nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;not indeed to comply with the vi&s;i|onary &s;chemes of gloomy enthu&s;ia&s;ts&mdash;but to prevent the entire depopulation of tho&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e I plead is &s;o well &s;upported by the Suffrages of Cu&s;tom and Right Rea&s;on, that I fear I have made an apology to the public nece&s;&s;ary for detaining it's attention &s;o long on arguments drawn from &s;elf-evident principles. I have heard of a certain Philo&s;opher who wrote a large folio vo|lume
<PB N="25" REF="012935_0022_0F903F3FEACEDCC0">
to prove that light came from the Sun. I flatter my&s;elf I am more excu&s;eable, as I write for the reforma|tion of gloomy fanaticks, who to muli&s;h ob&s;tinacy join a mo&s;t illiberal and malevolent turn of thinking; and I have no le&s;s in view than to convince them of errors far more mi&s;chievous in their con&s;equences, than any that could ari&s;e from its remaining undetermined, what may be the true &s;ource of light.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> is a &s;candalous libel, in which &s;ome of the We&s;t-Indians are unworthily traduced, I have al|ready proved; and am &s;ure that the lea&s;t the public can do, to te&s;tify a decent dete&s;tation of it's mo&s;t malevolent &s;landers, is to have it formally committed to the flames by the hands of the common hangman. The inhabitants &s;hould con&s;ider that the We&s;t-Indies form a con&s;iderable branch of their commerce, and that therefore it ill becomes them to &s;uffer <HI>any</HI> practice to be opprobriou&s;ly &s;tigmati|zed as unju&s;t or impolitic, in which the We&s;t-Indians happen to be concerned. They &s;hould al&s;o remember, that a genteel &s;um of money was lately received from that quarter, for the u&s;e of their College, for which they have been highly commended by its Provo&s;t. Every one mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that in delivering his commendations, he &s;poke the &s;entiments of the other Profe&s;&s;ors, and &s;ure|ly tho&s;e Gentlemen, equally remarkable for their piety and learning, would not have be&s;towed prai&s;es on a peo|ple, who&s;e conduct in <HI>any</HI> re&s;pect was exceptionable. It is therefore evident that all the Profe&s;&s;ors are Advocates for Slavery, and being learned and pious, it naturally follows that the Slave-trade in it&s;elf and in its con&s;equen|ces, is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with religion or &s;ound po|licy.</P>
