<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE object of the following work is, to give the people of this happy land a &s;triking and experimental proof of the hor|rible effects of anarchy and infidelity.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an undertaking, at this time, would have been, in a great mea|&s;ure, precluded, had our public prints been conducted with that impartiality and un|daunted adherence to truth, which the in|tere&s;ts of the community and of &s;uffering humanity demanded from them. But, &s;o far from this, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e ve|hicles of information have mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;|ly concealed, or glo&s;&s;ed over, the actions as well as the motives of the ruling powers in France; they have extenuated all their unheard-of acts of tyranny, on the fal&s;e but &s;pecious pretence, that they were conducive to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a free government; and, one of the editors has not blu&s;hed to declare, that <Q>It would be <HI>an ea&s;y matter to appologize for all the ma&s;&s;acres,</HI> that have taken place in that country.</Q></P>
<P>We have &s;een, indeed, &s;ome exceptions; &s;ome few prints that have not di&s;honoured them&s;elves by going this length: but even the&s;e have ob&s;erved a timid &s;ilence, and
<PB N="x" REF="030205_0009_0FE5116E01FB81E0">
have avoided &s;peaking of the &s;hocking bar|barities of the French, with as much cauti|on as if we were to partake in the di&s;grace, and as if it was in our power to hide them from the world and from po&s;terity. If they have, now and then given way to a ju&s;t in|dignation, this has been done in &s;uch a manner, and has been &s;o timid, as to do them but little honour. They have acted the part of the tyrannized people of Paris: they have huzza'd every &s;ucceeding tyrant, while on the theatre of power, and, the in|&s;tant he was transferred to a &s;caffold, they have covered him with reproach. They have attributed to factions, to individuals, what was the work of the national repre|&s;entatives, and of the nation it&s;elf. They have, in &s;hort, inveighed again&s;t the mur|derers of the fallen a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, while they have, in the &s;ame breath, applauded the princi|ples, on which they acted, and on which their &s;urvivers and their partizans do &s;till act.</P>
<P>Thus has the liberty of the pre&s;s, a liber|ty of which we &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t, been not on|ly u&s;ele&s;s to us during this terrible convul|&s;ion of the civilized world, but has been &s;o perverted as to lead us into errors, which had well nigh plunged us into the &s;ituation of our di&s;tracted allies. Nor are we yet &s;ecure. Di&s;organizing and bla&s;phemous
<PB N="xi" REF="030205_0010_0FE51176640C39C8">
principles have been di&s;&s;eminated among us with but too much &s;ucce&s;s; and, unle&s;s we profit from the awful example before us, we may yet experience all the calamities that heaven and earth now call on us to deplore.</P>
<P>Fully impre&s;&s;ed with this per&s;ua&s;ion, the author of the&s;e &s;heets has ventured to unde|ceive the mi&s;guided; to tear a&s;ide the veil, and &s;hew to a yet happy people the dangers they have to fear. With this object in view, he has too much confidence in the good &s;en&s;e and piety of the major part of his coun|trymen, not to be a&s;&s;ured, that his efforts will be &s;econded by their zeal in the cau&s;e of order and religion.</P>
<P>The materials for the work have been col|lected from different publications, <HI>all writ|ten by Frenchmen,</HI> and all, except one, from which only a few extracts were made, <HI>printed at Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Even the prints, repre&s;enting &s;ome of the frightful butcheries, perpetrated by the re|volutioni&s;ts, have been copied from French engravings.</P>
<P>Well aware that per&s;ons of a certain de&s;|cription will leave nothing untried to di&s;cre|dit a performance of this nature, the author has taken particular care to mention the work, and even the page, from which each fact is extracted.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="030205_0011_0FE51177F1A1EAD8">He fore&s;ees that the cant of <HI>modern pa|trioti&s;m</HI> will be poured forth again&s;t him on this occa&s;ion. He knows that he &s;hall be repre&s;ented as an enemy of the French na|tion and of the cau&s;e of liberty. To this he will an&s;wer before-hand, with the frankne&s;s of a man who thinks no freedom equal to that of &s;peaking the truth. As to the indi|viduals compo&s;ing this formerly amiable na|tion, many of them, and he hopes very many, are &s;till entitled to his love and e&s;|teem. He has, from his infancy, been an admirer of their &s;prightly wit; he owes a thou&s;and obligations to their officious ho&s;pi|tality, and has long boa&s;ted of their friend|&s;hip. But, with re&s;pect to the <HI>regenerated</HI> French, he would blu&s;h to be thought their friend, after what he has recorded in this volume.&mdash;And, as to the cau&s;e of liberty, if that cau&s;e is to be maintained, by fal&s;ehood bla&s;phemy, robbery, violation and murder, he is, and tru&s;ts he ever &s;hall be, its avowed and mortal enemy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT will be recollected by the greate&s;t part of my readers, that, &s;oon after the be|ginning of the French Revolution, the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly conceived the plan of de|&s;troying the religion of their forefathers. In order to effect this they &s;eparated the Gallican church from that of Rome, and impo&s;ed an oath on the clergy, which they could not take, without becoming apo&s;tate&punc; in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. All the worthy and con&s;cientious part of that body refu&s;ed of cour&s;e, and this refu&s;al was made
<PB N="16" REF="030205_0013_0FE5117C7362C518">
a pretext to drive them from their livings, and fill the vacancies with &s;uch as had more pliant con&s;ciencies, principles better adapted to the impious &s;y&s;tem, which the leaders in the A&s;&s;embly had prepared for their too credulous countrymen.</P>
<P>The ejectment of the prie&s;thood was at|tended with numberle&s;s acts of mo&s;t attroci|ous and wanton cruelty: the&s;e have been re|corded by the <HI>Abb&eacute; Barruel,</HI> in a work en|titled, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the French Clergy;</HI> and, though what is here to be found will dwindle into nothing, when compared to what I have extracted from other works, yet it could not be wholly omitted, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">howing a degree of in&s;en&s;ibility for the &s;uf|ferings of the&s;e men, that I am per&s;uaded the reader would not have excu&s;ed. I &s;hall therefore begin the relation with &s;ome ex|tracts from that work.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e extracts, as well as all tho&s;e that compo&s;e this compi|lation, are an abridged tran&s;lation from the French; but, as far as relates to tho&s;e con|tained in this chapter, the American reader may ea&s;ily verify the tran&s;lation by examin|ing the Engli&s;h edition of the Abb&eacute; <HI>Bar|ruel's</HI> work, which is to be found in mo&s;t parts of the Union.</P>

<P>Soon after the fir&s;t National A&s;&s;embly had decreed, that the Comtat of Avignon belonged to the French nation, an army of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, of whom one Jourdan, &s;ur-named the Cut-throat, was the commander, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the unfortunate city of Avig|non. The churches were immediately pil|laged, the &s;acred va&s;es profaned and carried off, and the altars levelled to the ground. The pri&s;ons were &s;oon filled, and the un|happy victims were relea&s;ed only to &s;uffer death. A deep pit was dug to receive their dead bodies, &s;ix hundred of which were thrown into it, mangled and di&s;torted, be|fore ten o'clock the next day. Among them was Mr. Nolhac, a prie&s;t, in the eighti|eth year of his age. He had been thirty years rector of St. Symphorien, a pari&s;h which he prefered to all others, and which he could not be prevailed on to quit for a more lucrative one, becau&s;e he would not de&s;ert the poor. During his rector&s;hip he had been the common father of his pari&s;h|ioners, the refuge of the indigent, the com|forter of the afflicted, and the friend and coun&s;ellor of every hone&s;t man. When the hour of danger approached, his friends advi&s;ed him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but no intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could
<PB N="18" REF="030205_0015_0FE51186ABA32868">
prevail on him to abandon his flock: "No," &s;aid the good old man, <Q>I have watched over them in the halcyon days of peace, and &s;hall I now leave them mid&s;t &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, without a guide; without any one to comfort them in their la&s;t dreary moments?</Q>&mdash;Mr. Nolhac, who, till now, had been re&s;pected even by the Cut|throats, was &s;ent to the pri&s;on the evening before the execution. His appearance and his &s;alutation, were tho&s;e of a con&s;oling an|gel: <Q>I come, my children, to die with you: we &s;hall &s;oon appear in the pre&s;ence of that God whom we &s;erve, and who will not de&s;ert us in the hour of death.</Q> He forti|fied their drooping courage, admini&s;tered the la&s;t con&s;olatory pledges of his love, and, the next day embraced and cheered each in|dividual as he was called forth by the mur|derers. Two of the&s;e &s;tood at the door with a bar of iron in their hands, and as the pri|&s;oners advanced knocked them down&punc; the bodies where then delivered over to the other ruffians, who hacked and disfigured them with their &s;abres, before they threw them into the pit, that they might not after|wards be known by their friends and rela|tions. &mdash;When the Cut-throats were di&s;per|&s;ed, every one was anxious to find the body of Mr. Nolhac. It was at la&s;t di&s;covered by the ca&s;&s;ock, and the crucifix which he

Among them was a Sulpician of 98 years of age, and a young Abb&eacute; of the name of Novi. The whole cho&s;e death, the venerable Sulpician leading the way. The trial of Mr. Novi was particularly &s;evere. The ruffians brought his father to the &s;pot, and told him, if he could per&s;uade his &s;on to &s;wear, he &s;hould live. The tender old man, wavering, he&s;itating between the feelings of nature and the duties of religion, at la&s;t yields to pa|rental fondne&s;s, throws his arms round his child's neck, buries his face in his bo&s;om, and with tears and &s;obs pre&s;&s;es his compli|ance. <Q>Oh! my child, my child, &s;pare the life of your Father!</Q>&mdash;<Q>My deare&s;t Fa|ther!

<P>In the &s;ame town, and on the &s;ame day, the ax was &s;u&s;pended over the head of Mr. Teron, when the revolutioni&s;ts bethought them that he had a &s;on. This &s;on was a|bout ten years of age, and, in order to en|joy the fathers torments and the child's tears both at a time, he was brought to the place of execution. His tears and cries gave a reli&s;h to the ferocious banquet. After tir|ing them&s;elves with the &s;pectacle, they put the father to death before the eyes of the child, whom they be&s;meared with his blood.</P>

<P>After having &s;poken of the conduct of the magi&s;trates and mob at Bourdeaux, the hi&s;torian mentions the death of Mr. Langoi|ran and the Abb&eacute; Dupuis, thus:</P>
<P>At the entrance of the court-hou&s;e, the Abb&eacute; Dupuis received a fir&s;t wound; others &s;oon levelled him to the ground. A young lad, of about fifteen or &s;ixteen, cut a hole in the cheek with a knife, to hold up the head by, while others were employed in haggling it from the body, which was &s;till in agonies. This operation not &s;ucceeding in &s;uch a crowd, they took hold of the legs, and dragged the carca&s;e about the &s;treets, and round the ramparts.</P>
<P>Mr. Langoiran had but ju&s;t &s;et his foot on the fir&s;t &s;tep of the &s;tairs, when he was knocked down. His head was hacked off in an in&s;tant, and a ruffian held it up, crying aloud: <Q>off with your hats! long live the nation</Q> The bareheaded populace an&s;wer|ed: "long live the nation" The head was then carried round the town in &s;ignal of a triumph, gained by a tumultuous populace and ten thou&s;and &s;oldiers under arms, over a poor defencele&s;s prie&s;t.</P>

<P>The 14th of July, &s;o famous in the annals of the Revolution, was this year celebrated at Limoges, by the death of Mr. Chabrol. He was a mo&s;t u&s;eful member of &s;ociety; di&s;tingui&s;hed round his neighbourhood as a bone-&s;etter; he was at once the &s;urgeon and the pa&s;tor of his pari&s;hioners; and among his murderers were &s;ome of tho&s;e who owed to him the u&s;e of their limbs. He was of a quick and impetuous temper, and indued with uncommon bodily &s;trength. His death certainly was not that of a chri&s;tian martyr; but it de&s;erves particular notice, as a &s;triking proof of the cowardly ferocity of the French populace.</P>
<P>He had taken &s;helter at a magi&s;trates, and begged leave to elude the mob by going out of the hou&s;e the back way; but the magi|&s;trate dur&s;t not comply.

Without a &s;ingle weapon of defence, he had to encounter hundreds of the mob, armed with clubs, guns, &s;abres, and knives; but, notwith&s;tanding the amaz|ing inequality, he held them a long time at bay.

<P>As &s;oon as the unfortunate Louis XVI. had been transfered from his throne to a loath&s;ome pri&s;on, the National A&s;&s;embly formed a plan for the total extirpation of the prie&s;ts, and with them the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion. The mini&s;ters of the altar were &s;eiz|ed and thrown into pri&s;on, or tran&s;ported, from every part of the country. At Paris about three hundred of them were &s;hut up, in order to be ma&s;&s;acred, and were actually put to death during the fir&s;t and &s;econd weeks of September, 1792.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="030205_0021_0FE5119852425CB8">About one hundred and eighty of the&s;e unhappy men were confined in the convent of the Carmelites. A troop of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins commenced the ma&s;&s;acre in the garden, where the prie&s;ts were permitted to take the air; but while they were proceeding, a com|mi&s;&s;ary arrived, and informed them that the work was not to go on that way. There were now about a hundred left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">live, who were all ordered into the &s;anctuary of the church; but, to get thither, they had to pa&s;s through a crowd of their murderers. One received a ball, another a blow, and another a &s;tab: &s;o that, when arrived in the &s;anctuary they pre|&s;ented a &s;cene, the mo&s;t heart-piercing that eyes ever beheld. Some were dragged in wounded, others quite dead. Even here, though &s;urrounded by a detachment of &s;oldi|ers, the blood-thir&s;ty mob ru&s;hed in upon them, and murdered &s;everal at the very altar. The &s;anctuary of a chri&s;tian church was, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer ap|peared among men, filled with a promi&s;cuous group of the living, the dying, and the dead.

<P>At the gate of the pri&s;on of La Force, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were placed in two rows: the two ruffians, called judges, who gave the &s;ignal of death, were placed at the gate; and as &s;oon as the pri&s;oner pa&s;&s;ed them, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins di&s;patched him with their knives or &s;abres, throwing the bodies in a heap at the end of the line. At the foot of this trophy of dead bodies, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, we mu&s;t now exhibit a &s;cene of a different kind, in the murder of the prince&s;s of Lamballe. She had retired in &s;afety to London; but her attachment to the royal family would not &s;uffer her to remain in her a&s;&s;ylum, while
<PB N="26" REF="030205_0023_0FE511A3AB16D2A0">
they were expo&s;ed. Her fidelity was a crime that the infidelity of her enemies could never forgive.</P>
<P>When this illu&s;trious victim was brought forth, &s;he was a&s;ked to &s;wear an eternal hatred to the king, the queen, and to roy|alty. <Q>The oath, &s;aid &s;he, is foreign to the &s;entiments of my heart, and I will never take it.</Q>&mdash;She was in&s;tantly deli|vered over to the mini&s;ters of death. The&s;e ruffians pretend to care&s;s her, &s;troke her cheeks with their hands yet reeking with human blood, and thus conduct her along the line. Amid&s;t all the&s;e in&s;ults her courage never de&s;erted her. When arrived at the heap of dead bodies, &s;he was ordered to kneel, and a&s;k pardon of the nation: "I have never injured the nation," &s;he replied, "nor will I a&s;k its pardon."&mdash; "Down," &s;aid they, "and a&s;k pardon, if you wi&s;h to live." "No," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;corn to a&s;k pardon from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins that call them&s;elves the nation: I will never bend my knee, or accept of a favour at &s;uch hands."</P>
<P>Her &s;oul was &s;uperior to fear. <Q>Kneel and a&s;k pardon</Q> was heard from a thou&s;and voices, but in vain. Two of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins now &s;eized her arms, and, pulling her from &s;ide to &s;ide, nearly di&s;located her &s;houlders. "Go on, &s;coundrels," &s;aid the heroic prin|ce&s;s,

"I will a&s;k no pardon."&mdash;In a rage to &s;ee them&s;elves thus overcome by the con|&s;tancy of a woman, they da&s;hed her down, and ru&s;hed in upon her with their knives and poignards. Her head &s;oon appeared hoi&s;ted upon a liberty pike, and her heart, after <HI>being bit</HI> by one of the ruffians, was put into a ba&s;on. Both were carried in triumph through the &s;treets of Paris. At la&s;t, after having fea&s;ted the eyes of the multitude, the bearers took them to the Temple, now be|come a pri&s;on, where one of the two com|mi&s;&s;aries that guarded the king, called him to the window, that he might &s;ee it; but his companion, a little more humane prevented the unfortunate monarch from approaching.

<P>At Rheims lived a man, who, from the number of his years, might be called the dean of Chri&s;tendom; and, from the fame of his virtues, the prie&s;t, by excellence. He had long been known by no other name than that of the holy prie&s;t. This was Mr. Pacquot, rector of St. John's. When the revolutionary a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins broke into his orato|ry, they found him on his knees. A true and faithful di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he yielded him&s;elf into the hands of his execu|tioners without &s;o much as a murmur, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led before the fero|cious

magi&s;trate, as a lamb to the &s;laughter. He cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet &s;inging the p&s;alms of David, while the &s;anguinary ruffians that conducted him, endeavoured to drown his voice by their bla&s;phemies. At the thre&s;hold of the town-hall an attempt was made to murder him, but the mayor interfered, &s;ay|ing to the people, <Q>What are you about? This old fellow is beneath notice.

Their refu&s;ing to do this is an in|controvertible te&s;timony, that they were no impo&s;tors or hypocrites, but &s;incere be|lievers of the religion they taught, and that they valued that religion more than life it|&s;elf; and, this is the be&s;t an&s;wer that can po&s;&s;ibly be given to all the &s;candalous and atrocious calumnies that their enemies and the enemies of Chri&s;tianity have vomited forth again&s;t them.</P>

<P>The grand &s;cene of de&s;truction and ma&s;|&s;acre was opened, in the once-flouri&s;hing and opulent city of Lyons, by a public pro|fanation of all tho&s;e things, that had been looked upon as &s;acred. The murderers in chief, cho&s;en from among the members of the National Convention, were a play-actor and a man who, under the old government, had been a bum-bailiff. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to brutify the minds of the populace; to ex|tingui&s;h the remaining &s;parks of humanity and religion, by teaching them to &s;et heaven and an hereafter at defiance; in order to
<PB N="35" REF="030205_0032_0FE511C0580BC6E8">
prepare them for the ma&s;&s;acres, which they, were commi&s;&s;ioned to execute.</P>
<P>A mock proce&s;&s;ion was formed, in imi|tation of tho&s;e ob&s;erved by the catholic church. It was headed by a troop of men bearing in their hands the chalices and other va&s;es which had been taken from the plundered churches, At the head of the proce&s;&s;ion there was an A&s;s, dre&s;&s;ed in the ve&s;tments of the prie&s;ts that the revolutio|nary army had murdered in the neighbour|hood of the city, with a mitre on his head. This bea&s;t, a bea&s;t of the &s;ame kind on which our Redeemer rode, now bore a load of crucifixes, and other &s;ymbols of the chri&s;tian religion; having the old and new te&s;tament tied to his tail. When this pro|ce&s;&s;ion came to the &s;pot which had been fixed on for the purpo&s;e, the bible was burnt, and the A&s;s given to drink out of the &s;acra|mental cup, amid&s;ts the &s;houts and rejoicing of the bla&s;phemous a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>Such a begining plainly foretold what was to follow. An undi&s;tingui&s;hed butche|ry of all the rich immediately commenced. Hundreds of per&s;ons, women as well as men, were taken out of the city at a time, tied to trees, &s;hot to death, &s;tabbed, or el&s;e knock|ed on the head. In the city the guillotine never cea&s;ed a moment; it was &s;hifted three times; holes were dug at each place to re|ceive

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE work which we are now entering on was publi&s;hed at Paris during the la&s;t year; but, as an introduction to the facts
<PB N="45" REF="030205_0042_0FE511E1A5FD24B8">
extracted from it, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give the reader a conci&s;e &s;ketch of the progre&s;s of the Revolution down to the epoch when the work was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Sates-General, con&s;i&s;ting of the three orders, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Tiers-Etat, or commonalty, were a&s;&s;embled on the 4th of May, 1789. The deputies were all furni&s;hed with written in&s;tructions in which they were po&s;itively enjoined to make no innovations as to the form of go|vernment. Notwith&s;tanding this, it is well known, they framed a con&s;titution by which the government was totally changed, the nobility aboli&s;hed, and the church rent from that of Rome. Their con&s;titution, however, though e&s;tabli&s;hed at the expence of thou|&s;ands of lives, and though one of the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;y&s;tems of government that ever was invented, did not fail to meet with par|tizans; and we have heard it exotolled in this country as the ma&s;ter-piece of human wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly, which has been com|monly called the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, en|ded its benificent labours on the 30th of September, 1791, and was immediately &s;uc|ceeded by another, which took the name of the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly. Mo&s;t men of &s;en&s;e fore&s;aw that the &s;econd A&s;&s;embly would im|prove upon the plan of de&s;truction marked
<PB N="46" REF="030205_0043_0FE511EDFA362538">
out by the fir&s;t. The Clergy and many men of family and fortune had been already driven from their homes and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it remained for the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly to fini&s;h the work by &s;eizing on their property and expo&s;ing it to &s;ale: this they failed not to do. Per&s;ecution and ma&s;&s;acre increa&s;ed daily; but as the &s;mall remains of power left in the hands of the king was &s;till an ob|&s;tacle, or rather as the monarchy it&s;elf was an ob&s;tacle, they were determined to get rid of it. On the 10th of Augu&s;t, 1792, the king was dethroned (his fate is well known) and the daggers of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were from that moment drawn, never more to be &s;heathed, but in the heart of &s;ome in|nocent victim. We have already &s;een &s;ome|thing of the ma&s;&s;acres which followed this event at Paris and other places; but even the&s;e are trifles to what was to follow.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of September, 1792, the third A&s;&s;embly, generally called the National Convention, opened their &s;e&s;&s;ions, and, though every individual member had repeat|edly taken an oath to maintain the authority of the king, they at once declared France to be a republic.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, this Con|vention declared war again&s;t a great part of the powers of Europe; and, in order to be in a &s;ituation to make head again&s;t their
<PB N="47" REF="030205_0044_0FE511EF8AA82640">
enemies, &s;eized on all the precious metals in the country, or rather they enacted &s;uch laws as obliged the poor oppre&s;&s;ed people to bring it to their trea&s;ury, and receive in exchange a vile and worthle&s;s paper money. The churches were in&s;tantly pillaged, and no per&s;on dared appear with a watch, or any other article in gold or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The violation of property was only a part of their plan. The hearts of the lower or|ders of the people were to be hardened; they were to be rendered brutal; all fear of an hearafter was to be rooted from their &s;ouls, before they could be fit in&s;truments in the hands of this helli&s;h A&s;&s;embly. With this object in view, they declared our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and redeemer to be an Impo&s;|tor, forbade the acknowledgement of him, and the exerci&s;e of his wor&s;hip. The chur|ches were turned into pri&s;ons, &s;tables, &amp;c. and over the gateways of the burial grounds were written: <Q>This is the place of <HI>eternal &s;leep.</HI></Q> Never &s;urely was there a better plan for transforming a civilized people into a hoard of cut-throats. It &s;ucceeded com|pleatly. The blood now flowed at Paris in an uncea&s;ing &s;tream. A permanent tribu|nal was e&s;tabli&s;hed, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s was to condemn, and certify to the Convention that the executions went on according to the li&s;ts &s;ent from its committees.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="030205_0045_0FE511F26473A270">Be&s;ides legions of executioners there were others of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The command of the&s;e latter was given to tho&s;e members of the Convention who were &s;ent into the different parts of the country. Terror preceded the&s;e harbingers of death, and their foot&s;teps were marked with blood. The &s;word, the fire, and the water, all became in&s;truments of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>During this murdering time, which has ju&s;tly a&s;&s;umed the name of the <HI>reign of ter|ror,</HI> the leaders of &s;everal factions of the revolutioni&s;ts them&s;elves received their re|ward on a &s;caffold, and, among others, Robe&s;pierre and his accomplices. When the&s;e men fell, the Convention, according to its u&s;ual cu&s;tom, a&s;cribed all the cruel|ties, committed during &s;ometime before their death, to them alone, and the people, always eager for blood, now demanded the heads of tho&s;e whom they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the murder of their countrymen. By &s;a|crificing the&s;e its in&s;truments, the Con|vention &s;aw a fair opportunity of removing the infamy from it&s;elf, and of perpetuating its power. In con&s;equence, many of them were tried and executed, and among others Carrier (a member of the Convention) who had been &s;tationed at Nantz, with the mem|bers of the revolutionary committee of that unfortunate town. From the trial of the&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="030205_0046_0FE511FBD89453F0">
men it is that I have &s;elected the facts which are to compo&s;e this chapter. The trial was before the tribunal at Paris, to which place the accu&s;ed were carried from Nantz.</P>
<P>It has been repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, by tho&s;e who &s;eem to have more attachment to the cau&s;e of the French than to that of truth, that the barbarities committed in that coun|try, have been by the hands of foreigners. Such a &s;tory is impo&s;&s;ible, and even ridi|culous; but however, it has induced me to in&s;ert here a li&s;t of the barbarous wretch|es who were &s;o long the &s;courge of the city of Nants, from which it will appear, that they were all Frenchmen, born and bred. This is an act of ju&s;tice due to other nations.</P>

<P>Carrier was the great mover, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in-general; the committee were his agents. Some of them were always a&s;&s;embled in their hall, to give directions to the under|murderers, while the others took repo&s;e, or were di&s;patched on important expedition, &s;uch as the &s;hooting or drowning of hundreds at a time. They &s;tood in need, however, of &s;ubaltern cut-throats, more determined and bloody than the people in general; and therefore they rai&s;ed a company, who took the title of the company of Marat, compo&s;ed of the vile&s;t wretches that were to be found.

<P><HI>Tronjolly,</HI> a witne&s;s, informs the tribu|nal, that the Company of Marat was at fir&s;t compo&s;ed of &s;ixty per&s;ons; that Goullin openly propo&s;ed that none but the mo&s;t in|famous villains &s;hould be admitted into it: and, at each nomination, cried out, <Q>Is there no greater &s;coundrel to be found?</Q></P>
<P>On the 24th of October, &s;ays the wit|ne&s;s, I heard Goullin and his colleagues &s;ay, that they were going to give a great exam|ple; that the pri&s;oners &s;hould be all &s;hot. I atte&s;t that this &s;cene was &s;till more horrible than that of the 22d and 23d of September. The Company of Marat were carou&s;ing round a table, and at the &s;ame time it was deliberated whether the pri&s;oners &s;hould not be ma&s;&s;acred by hundreds. In this deli|beration, Coullin was for indi&s;criminate death: and thus were the pri&s;oners, without ever being interrogated, or heard, con|demned to die. There exi&s;ted no proofs of guilt again&s;t the&s;e unfortunate pri&s;oners; they were what were called <HI>&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons;</HI> the felons, and all <HI>real</HI> criminals were &s;et at liberty.</P>

<P>Old men, women with child, and chil|dren, were drowned, no di&s;tinction. They were put on board of lighters, which were railed round to keep the pri&s;oners from jumping overboard if they &s;hould happen to di&s;engage them&s;elves. There were plugs made in the bottom, or &s;ides, which, be|ing pulled out, the lighter &s;unk, and all in it were drowned. The&s;e expeditions were fir&s;t carried on by night, but the &s;un &s;oon beheld the murderous work.

In order to have a pretext for doing this, &s;aid Goudet, we &s;hall give out, that there exi&s;ts a con&s;piration again&s;t the republic. I am to make the general beat early in the morning.

<P><HI>Mariotte,</HI> a witne&s;s, informs the tribu|nal that he was detached on a party to &s;e|ven miles di&s;tant from Nantz. The party, &s;ays the witne&s;s, went into the neighbour|hood of the fore&s;t of Rinc&eacute;, and took up their quarters in a hou&s;e occupied by Mrs. Chauvette. Five days after our arrival, came Pinard, about midnight, and told us that we were in the hou&s;e of an ari&s;tocrat. He bragged of having that evening killed &s;ix women, and &s;aid that Chauvette &s;hould make the &s;eventh. He threatened her, and, to add to her torment, told her to comfort her&s;elf, for that her child &s;hould die fir&s;t. It is Pinard, adds he, that now &s;peaks to you; Pinard, that carries on the war again&s;t the female &s;ex. I drew my &s;word, continues the witne&s;s, and told Pinard that he &s;hould

I an&s;wered, give me your word not to hurt the woman nor her child, and I will bring her forth. He pro|mi&s;ed, and I brought them out. The wo|man, &s;eeing that &s;he was conducted to a &s;ort of cellar, cried out, I know I am brought here to be murdered, like the wo|men who&s;e throats were cut in this place ye&s;terday. All the favour I a&s;k, &s;aid &s;he, is that you will kill me before you kill my child. She was now que&s;tioned about the money; but &s;he continued her prote&s;tations of knowing nothing of it.

<P>The &s;ame witne&s;s relates another adventure. When we were going hence, &s;ays he, to|wards the fore&s;t of Rinc&eacute;, we heard a man, in a little wood, crying for help. We found Pinard, and two other hor&s;emen each hav|ing a piece of linen under his arm. We left them, and &s;oon after &s;aw two poor pea|&s;ants running away. In going along among the bru&s;hwood, &s;ays the witne&s;s, I heard &s;omething ru&s;tle almo&s;t under my feet: I knocked the bu&s;hes a&s;ide with my mu&s;ket; what &s;hould it be but two children. I gave one of them, who was &s;even years old, into the care of Cedr&eacute;, and kept the other, of five years old, my&s;elf. They both cried bitterly. Their cries brought to us two women, their mothers, who were al&s;o hid among the bu&s;hes; they threw them&s;elves upon their knees, and be&s;ought us not to kill their children. In quitting the wood Pinard came up with us, he had &s;everal wo|men, whom I &s;aw him chop down, and murder with his &s;abre. What, &s;ays he to me, are you going to do with tho&s;e two children? &s;tand away, &s;ays he, till I blow out their brains. I oppo&s;ed him, and while we were in di&s;pute, two volunteers brought an old man, &s;tone-blind. This we now

found was the grandfather of the children. Pray, &s;aid the poor old man, take my life, and pre&s;erve my little darlings. I told him that we would take care of them; he wept and &s;queezed my hand. This unfortunate old man, adds the witne&s;s, was murdered as well as the women.</P>
<P>Pinard quitted the high road in returning, for no other purpo&s;e but that of murdering. He and his companions killed all they came at, men women and children of all ages. To ju&s;tify his barbarity, he produced the decree that ordered him to &s;pare neither &s;ex nor age.</P>
<P>My reader will recollect, that the Na|tional Convention of France had aboli&s;hed <HI>negro-&s;lavery;</HI> and he will al&s;o recollect, that the <HI>humanity</HI> of this mea&s;ure has been much applauded by tho&s;e who have not penetra|tion enough to &s;ee their motive in &s;o doing.</P>

<P>The revolutionary ho&s;pital, &s;ays the wit|ne&s;s, was totally unprovided with every nece|&s;&s;ary.

<P>I accu&s;e this committee of having ordered, to my knowledge, the &s;hooting or drowning of between four and five hundred children, the olde&s;t of which were not more than fourteen years of age.</P>
<P>Minguet, one of the committee, had giv|en me an order to choo&s;e two from among the children, whom I intended to &s;ave from death and bring up.

<P><HI>Lacaille,</HI> keeper of another pri&s;on, called the <HI>Bouffay,</HI> gives a circum&s;tantial account of one of the drownings.</P>
<P>The horrid night, &s;ays the witne&s;s, of the 23d of October, two &s;oldiers of the Company of Marat came to the <HI>Bouffay,</HI> each with a bundle of cords. About nine o'clock they told me there were one hun|dred and fifty five pri&s;oners, whom they were to transfer to Belle&mdash;I&s;le, to work at a fortre&s;s. About an hour after arrived thirty or forty more of the&s;e &s;oldiers. An order from the committee was produced for the delivery of one hundred and fifty five of my pri&s;oners. I ob&s;erved to them, that &s;e|veral of the pri&s;oners on the li&s;t were now at liberty, or in the ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>They now &s;et down to table, and after having &s;upped, and drank heartily, they brought out their cords, and diverted them|&s;elves

<P>Grand-Mai&s;on now entered the court yard, and hollowed out to them to di&s;patch. Goullin came &s;tamping and &s;wearing, becau&s;e the number on the li&s;t could not be com|pleated.

In&s;tead of one hundred and fifty five, Goullin at la&s;t con&s;ented to take one hun|dred and twenty nine; but this number not being complete, the equitable and tender-hearted Goullin orders the remainder to be taken from the pri&s;oners indi&s;tinctly; and when this was done he marches off at the head of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to conduct them to the river, where they were all drowned.</P>

<HEAD>Marat.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Marat has been &s;o often mentioned, it may not be improper, or out of place, to give the reader here &s;ome ac|count of that famous cut-throat.</P>
<P>Before the Revolution, he was an ob|&s;cure beggarly fellow, that was daily liable to be brought before the officer of police to give an account of the manner in which he got his bread. But, when this grand event took place; when murderers were wanted in every quarter of the country, he began to cut a figure on the &s;cene. He publi&s;hed a gazette, in which he inculcated the nece&s;&s;ity of lopping off the heads of thou&s;ands at a time, and of watering, as he called it, the tree of liberty with the blood of the ari&s;tocrats, as the only means of rendering it fruitful.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like &s;entiments, recom|mended him to the notice of his country|men;
<PB N="116" REF="030205_0114_0FE512E28C7B05C8">
he obtained their confidence, and was one of the <HI>organizers</HI> (to u&s;e a french term) of the ma&s;&s;acres of the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792, of which I have &s;poken in the fir&s;t chapter of this work. On this occa&s;ion he was an actor al&s;o, and is &s;aid to have cut above fifty throats with his own hands.</P>
<P>It would have been &s;omething unju&s;t if a man like this had been forgotten, when the Convention was to a&s;&s;emble. He was not. The people of Paris, who had been eye-witne&s;&s;es of his merit, cho&s;e him for one of their repre&s;entatives; and he was faithful in the execution of his tru&s;t; for he never talked about any thing but of throats to cut, &s;tabbing, and guillotining.</P>
<P>His career, however, was but &s;hort. His own neck was not made of iron: a de&s;pe|rate woman, who had adopted his princi|ples, ru&s;hed into his apartment, and deli|vered the world of one of the greate&s;t mon|&s;ters that ever di&s;honoured it.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething horrible in the look of this villain. He was very &s;hort and thick, had a black beard a&s;cending nearly to the extreme corners of his eyes. This beard was u&s;ually long, and his hair &s;hort, &s;ticking up like bri&s;tles. He had ever been dirty, and it may be imagined, that the fa&s;hions of a revolution which has made it

a <HI>crime</HI> to be <HI>well-dre&s;&s;ed,</HI> had not improved his appearance: in &s;hort, he was at the very be&s;t, a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting mortal, and, there|fore, when he came out of the pri&s;on of La Force, all covered with filth and gore, wielding a pi&s;tol in one hand and a dagger in the other, no wonder that even the &s;an|guinary mob ran back for fear.</P>

<P>As I have entered on a digre&s;&s;ion, I will continue it a little longer, to give the rea|der an account of the execution of Char|lotte Cord&eacute;e, the young woman that mur|dered Marat.</P>
<P>She was not what is commonly called an ari&s;tocrat; but a patriot of another faction than Marat. She was, as it is &s;aid, em|ployed by the party of Bri&s;&s;ot, who, from the accompli&s;hments of Marat, were affraid that he would totally engro&s;s the favour and affections of the people. Poor Charlotte received her reward on the &s;caffold; and a very ju&s;t reward too; but there is &s;ome|thing &s;o &s;hocking in the behaviour of her executioner, that it ought not to be omitted in a collection of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="030205_0116_0FE512EADB656D80">She was a beautiful young woman; ex|tremely fair; and, in any other country, would have brought tears of compa&s;&s;ion from the &s;pectators. The executioner, after having cut off her head, &s;eized it by the fine long hair, and, holding it up by one hand, the brutal ruffian gave her a &s;lap in the face with the other. <Q>The bitch blu&s;hes, cried he, at any rate.</Q> This trait of hangman wit, excited the &s;avage mirth of the populace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;omething very remarkable that her face, &s;e|vered from the body, &s;hould blu&s;h; but it is a real fact, as appears from an e&s;&s;ay lately republi&s;hed at Philadelphia, in Gatreau's gazette.</NOTE></P>
<P>We mu&s;t now return to Nantz, where we &s;hall find the revolutionary committee em|ployed in writing to their friends at Paris.</P>
<P>Before they began to drown and &s;hoot by hundreds, they had &s;eized on the per&s;ons of one hundred and thirty two of the mo&s;t oppulent men in the city, and &s;ent them off to Paris to be tried as <HI>&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons.</HI> It appears, from the whole cour&s;e of the evi|dence on this head, that the detachment of patriots who conducted them, were, if any pretence could be found, to murder them all by the way. This, however, did not

happen. The pri&s;oners arrived &s;afe at Paris, and the committee were obliged to have re|cour&s;e to other means, to prevent their re|turn. The one that they adopted was to in&s;ure their guillotining at Paris; and, for this purpo&s;e, they wrote to the revolu|tionary committee of the the &s;ection of Lepelletier.&mdash;Their letter is, and I hope it ever will be, a curio&s;ity in this country.

<P>For my part, &s;ays the witne&s;s, my re&s;o|lution was taken.

<P>It &s;eems, from the evidence of &s;everal wit|ne&s;&s;es, that, while the&s;e villains were but|chering, or &s;tiffling their own countrymen, they took care to treat foreign pri&s;oners with &s;ome &s;ort of humanity.

<P>The reader's curio&s;ity may, perhaps, lead him to wi&s;h to know the whole number of per&s;ons put to death at Nantz; but, in this, it would be difficult to gratify him.

The deaths mu&s;t, however, have been immen&s;e, &s;ince a witne&s;s depo&s;es (VOL. III. PAGE 55) to the drowning of <HI>nine thou&s;and</HI> per&s;ons; and ano|ther witne&s;s (VOL. II.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Facts from &s;everal works, proving that the cruelties related in the preceding chapters, were authorized, or approved of by the Na|tional A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER having led the reader through &s;uch rivers of blood, it &s;eems indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert a few facts, &s;howing by who&s;e authority that blood was &s;pilt; for, it could an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e to excite his dete&s;tation, without directing it towards the proper object.</P>
<P>When the French fir&s;t began that career of in&s;urrection, robbery and murder, which a&s;&s;umed the name of a Revolution, the peo|ple of this country, or at lea&s;t the mo&s;t numerous part of them, felt uncommon anxiety for its &s;ucce&s;s. The people were deceived; but the deception was an agree|able one; the word <HI>Revolution</HI> had of it&s;elf very great charms, but when that of <HI>Liber|ty</HI> was added to it, it could not fail of ex|citing enthu&s;ia&s;m. This enthu&s;ia&s;m was, in|deed, nearly general; and this alone was a &s;ufficient inducement for the public prints to become the partizans of Condorcet and Mi|rabeau. All the avenues to truth were at
<PB N="134" REF="030205_0133_0FE5130DAEB36608">
once barred up; and, though the revolu|tioni&s;ts every day changed their creed, though one revolving moon &s;aw them make and break their oaths, all was amply atoned for by their being engaged in a Revolution.</P>
<P>As the Revolution advanced the enthu|&s;ia&s;m increa&s;ed; but from the moment that the French nation declared it&s;elf a <HI>Republic,</HI> this enthu&s;ia&s;m was changed to madne&s;s. All the means by which this change of go|vernment was to be accompli&s;hed were to|tally overlooked; nothing was talked or dreamed of but the enfranchi&s;ement of the world; the whole univer&s;e was to become a republic, or be annihilated; and happy was he who could bawl loude&s;t about a certain &s;omething, called <HI>liberty and equality.</HI></P>
<P>During this political madne&s;s, however, now and then a trait of &s;hocking barbarity, in &s;pite of all the endeavours of the public pa|pers, bur&s;t in upon us, and produced a lu|cid interval; but the&s;e intervals have never yet been of long duration; becau&s;e every &s;ubterfuge, that intere&s;ted fal&s;ehood can de|vi&s;e, has been made u&s;e of to give our abhor|rence a direction contrary to that which it ought to have taken. We have heard Bri&s;&s;ot, Danton, Marat, and Robe&s;pierre, all accu&s;ed in their turns of &s;hedding inno|cent blood; but the <HI>National A&s;&s;embly</HI> it&s;elf, they tell us has ever remained worthy of
<PB N="135" REF="030205_0134_0FE5136DE759BEE8">
our admiration. The poor un&s;ucce&s;sful agents of this terrible divan have been de|voted to execration, as tyrants, while their employers have been, and are yet held up to us as the friends of liberty and the lovers of mankind.</P>
<P>Without further remark, I &s;hall add &s;uch facts as, I imagine, will enable every reader to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To begin with the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly; one proof of their approving of murder will &s;uffice. They honoured with the title of <HI>vanqui&s;hers,</HI> a blood-thir&s;ty mob, who after having taken two men pri&s;oners, cruelly ma&s;&s;acred them, and carried their heads about the &s;treets of Paris on a pike. <HI>See Rabaud's hi&s;tory of the French Revolution</HI> page 106.</P>
<P>The &s;econd A&s;&s;embly, when they received advices of the murders of Jourdan and his a&s;&s;ociates at Avignon, as mentioned in the fir&s;t chapter of this work, threatened the member who communicated the news, be|cau&s;e he had called the murderers <HI>brigands,</HI> and not <HI>patriots.</HI> See <HI>La Gazette Univer&s;et|le</HI> for the month of May 1792.&mdash;And, how did this A&s;&s;embly behave, when informed of the ma&s;&s;acres in the pri&s;ons of Paris, du|ring the fir&s;t days of September, 1792? <HI>Tallien</HI> (of whom we have lately heard &s;o

much) came to the National A&s;&s;embly, and informed them of the murdering in the fol|lowing remarkable words: <Q>The commi&s;|&s;aries have done all they could to pre|vent the <HI>di&s;orders</HI> (the ma&s;&s;acreing the pri|&s;oners is what he calls <HI>di&s;orders</HI>) but they have not been able to &s;top the, in &s;ome &s;ort, <HI>Ju&s;t vengeance</HI> of the people.</Q>&mdash;The A&s;|&s;embly heard this language very quietly, and Doctor Moore, from who&s;e journal (page 178) the fact is taken, makes an apology for the A&s;&s;embly, by &s;aying that they were <HI>overawed;</HI> but it has &s;ince fully appeared, that the leading members were the very per|&s;ons who contrived the ma&s;&s;acre, with the aid of Petion, Manuel, and Marat.&mdash;It is a well known fact, recorded by the Abb&eacute; Barruel (page 334) that <HI>Louvet,</HI> one of the members of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly, gave, the day after the September ma&s;&s;acre, an order on the public trea&s;ury, in the following words: <Q>On &s;ight, pay to the four bearers each twelve livres, for aiding in the di&s;|patching of the prie&s;ts at the pri&s;on of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Firmin.</Q>&mdash;Louvet was, at the time of writing this note on demand for murderer's wages, a <HI>legi&s;lator;</HI> and I cannot help re|marking here, that a printer of a news-pa|per in the United States, has lately boa&s;ted, that this Louvet, "now pre&s;ident of the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly on earth," &s;ays our printer,
<PB N="137" REF="030205_0136_0FE5136F707015E0">
was <HI>the editor of a gazette!</HI>&mdash;People &s;hould be cautious how they boa&s;t of relation&s;hip with the legi&s;lators in that country of equa|lity.</P>
<P>As it will no longer be pretended, I &s;up|po&s;e, that this &s;econd A&s;&s;embly di&s;approved of the murders that were committed under their reign, I will now turn to the third A&s;&s;embly, which we commonly call a Con|vention. And, not to tire the reader with proofs of what is &s;elf evident, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to an extract or two from the trial of Carrier and the revolutionary committee of Nantz.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VOL. V. PAGE 49.</HEAD>
<P>It is time, &s;ays Goullin, to tear a&s;ide the veil. The repre&s;entatives Bourbotte and Bo knew all about the drownings and &s;hoot|ings; and Bo even &s;aid to Huchet, in|&s;peaking of the members of the revolutiona|ry committee, that it was <HI>not for the murders</HI> that they were to be tried.</P>
<P>After this the coun&s;ellor for the commit|tee a&s;ks this citizen Bo, what was the real motive for bringing the committee to trial; and the other confe&s;&s;es, that it was for their having <HI>mi&s;applied the trea&s;ures</HI> taken from

the pri&s;oners. He pretends (page 60) though he had taken the place of Carrier at Nantz, and though the water of the river could not be drank, on account of the dead bodies that were floating on it; though a hundred or two of ditches had been dug to put the people into that were &s;hot, and though the city was filled with cries and lamentations; notwith&s;tanding all this, he pretends that he could &s;ay nothing, for cer|tain, <HI>about the murders.</HI></P>
<P>This repre&s;entative Bo (page 83.) is convicted of having him&s;elf ju&s;tified the con|duct of the committee and of Carrier.</P>
<P>Carrier, in his defence, &s;ays, that he had done no more than <HI>his duty,</HI> and that <HI>the Convention had been regularly informed of eve|ry thing.</HI> They complain now, &s;ays he (page 119 of &s;hootings <HI>en ma&s;&s;e,</HI> as if <HI>the &s;ame had not been done at Angers, Saumur, Laval, and every where el&s;e.</HI>)</P>

means of lighters with plugs in the bottom, Carrier was not blamed; on the contrary, he was <HI>repeatedly applauded,</HI> as being the author of <HI>an invention that did honour to his country!</HI></P>
<P>But, what need have we of the&s;e proofs? What other te&s;timony do we want, than that contained in their own murderous de|crees?

Blood is their element, as water is that of the finny race.</P>
<P>One thing, however, remains to be ac|counted for; and that is, how &s;o great a part of the nation were led to butcher each other; how they were brought to that pitch of brutal &s;anguinary ferocity, which we have &s;een &s;o amply di&s;played in the preceed|ing Chapters.

<P>THAT the French were an amiable people the whole civilized world has given abundant te&s;timony, by endeavouring to imitate them. There was not a nation in Europe but had, in &s;ome degree, adopt|ed their language and their fa&s;hions; and all tho&s;e individuals, belonging even to their haughty rival enemy, who travelled in their country, were led by an involun|tary impul&s;e into an imitation of their manners.</P>
<P>The prominent feature in their national character was, it is true, <HI>levity;</HI> but, though levity and ferociou&s;ne&s;s may, and often do, meet in the &s;ame per&s;on, no writer, that I recollect, had ever accu&s;ed the French of being cruel. If we are to judge of their

di&s;po&s;ition by their national &s;ports and en|tertainments, we &s;hall find no room to draw a conclu&s;ion again&s;t their humanity. The&s;e cruel diver&s;ions, where men become the bullies of brute creatures, and laugh at &s;ee|ing them goad, and bite, and tear each other to pieces, were never known in France. Even in their theatrical performances a dead body was never exhibited on the &s;cene: &s;uch a &s;pectacle was thought to be too much for the feelings of the audience. The works of their favourite authors generally breathe the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s and humanity.

<P>The&s;e ver&s;es, extracted from the mo&s;t elegant of poems, dictated by the be&s;ts of hearts, contain the ju&s;te&s;t character of the French nation, that I have ever yet &s;een.

<P>Whence, then, the mighty, the dread|ful change? What is it that has transfor+med a great portion of this airy humane people into a horde of &s;ullen a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? What is it that has converted the&s;e thought|le&s;s realms; this gay &s;prightly land of mirth, this bright domain, into a gloomy wilder|ne&s;s watered with rivers of human blood? This ought to be the great object of our en|quiries:
<PB N="143" REF="030205_0143_0FE5137E240AE5F0">
this ought to fix all our attention. Without determining this point, we can draw no profit from the preceding relation, and, without attempting it, I &s;hould have undertaken the unplea&s;ant ta&s;k of holding the French people up to reproach and de|te&s;tation to no manner of purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, again and again, by the partizans of the French revolution, that all the crimes which have di&s;graced it, are to be a&s;cribed to the ho&s;tile operations of their enemies. They have told us, that, had not the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians been on their march to Paris, the pri&s;oners would not have been ma&s;&s;acred, on the 2nd and 3rd of September, 1792. But, can we po&s;&s;ibly conceive how the murder of 8,000 poor pri&s;oners, locked up and bound, could be nece&s;&s;ary to the defence of a Capital, containing a million of inhabitants? Can we believe that the &s;abres of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins would not have been more effectually em|ployed again&s;t the invaders, than again&s;t de|fencele&s;s prie&s;ts and women. The deluded populace were told not <Q>to leave the wol|ves in the fold while they went to at|tack tho&s;e that were without.</Q> But the&s;e wolves, if they were &s;uch, were in pri&s;on; were under a guard an hundred thou&s;and times as &s;trong as them&s;elves, and could have been de&s;troyed at a moment's

warning. There is &s;omething &s;o abomina|bly cowardly in this ju&s;tification, that it is even more ba&s;e than the crime. Suppo&s;e that a hundred thou&s;and men had marched from Paris, to make head again&s;t the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians, there were yet nine hundred thou&s;and left to guard the unhappy wretch|es that were tied hand and foot. Where could be the nece&s;&s;ity of ma&s;&s;acreing them! Where could be the nece&s;&s;ity of hacking them to pieces, tearing out their bowels, and biting their hearts?</P>
<P>Sub&s;equent events have fully proved, that it was not danger that produced the&s;e bloody mea&s;ures: for, we have ever &s;een the revolutioni&s;ts mo&s;t cruel in times of their greate&s;t &s;ecurity. Their butcheries at Lyons and in its neighbourhood did not be|gin, till they were completely triumphant. It was then, at the moment when they had no retaliation to fear, that they commenced their bloody work. Carrier, lolling at at his ea&s;e, &s;ent the victims to death by hun|dreds. The blood never flowed from the guillotine in &s;uch torrents, as at the very time when their armies were driving their enemies before them in every direction.</P>
<P>Charles Fox (who, by the bye, would not have made a bad cut-throat general) Charles Fox had the folly and impudence to &s;ay, in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons,
<PB N="145" REF="030205_0145_0FE5137FD06A4540">
that the ma&s;&s;acres in France ought to be attributed to the Allied Powers. <Q>You hunt them like wild bea&s;ts,</Q> &s;aid this hu|mane and hone&s;t &s;windler, <Q>and then you complain of them for being ferocious.</Q> How this hunting, as Fox calls it, could drive the French to butcher one another, I cannot &s;ee; but if it was a ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on for them, it might certainly be applied with much more ju&s;tice to their enemies; for the&s;e have been oftener obliged to fly than the French. The revolutionary armies have overrun an extent of territory equal to one third of their own country: the Savoyards, the Germans, the Flemings, the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the Engli&s;h, have been obliged to fly before them; but we have heard of no ma&s;&s;acres among the&s;e people. The French mo&s;t unmercifully put to death eight thou&s;and of their country people, who were in the pri&s;ons of Paris, and, as an ex|cu&s;e for this, they tell us that the Duke of Brun&s;wick had invaded the province of Champagne; but they them&s;elves have overrun all the United Netherlands, and even taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital; and we have not heard, that the Dutch have as yet been guilty of a &s;ingle ma&s;&s;acre. They have found but one place in all their ca|reer, where the people could be prevailed on to erect a guillotine, and that was at
<PB N="146" REF="030205_0146_0FE513815815C968">
Geneva. Here their army was more nu|merous than the whole population of the &s;tate, and therefore their &s;y&s;tem was fully adopted; yet even here, among this little deba&s;ed and tyranized people, there were to be found no villains infamous enough to imitate their ma&s;ters in murdering women and children. That was a &s;pecies of &s;laught|er re&s;erved for the French nation alone.</P>
<P>The French revolution has been com|pared to that of America, and I have heard &s;ome men, calling them&s;elves Americans, who have not been a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that as great cruelties were committed in this coun|try as in that. I would now a&s;k the&s;e men, who are &s;o anxious to be thought as bloo|dy as the &s;ans-culotte French, if they can give me one in&s;tance of the Americans mur|dering their towns-men at the approach of the enemy? When the Briti&s;h army &s;uc|ceeded that of the Congre&s;s at Philadelphia, did the continental troops murder all the Tories, before they quitted the city? Can the&s;e generous friends of the French revo|lution tell us of any ma&s;&s;acres that took place in this country? Did they ever hear of women and children being drowned and &s;hot by hundreds? Seven years of civil war de&s;olated the&s;e &s;tates; but the blood of one &s;ingle woman or child never &s;tained the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030205_0147_0FE513EAD2682C68">If the doctrine of the pro&s;ligate Charles Fox be admitted, if a people be ju&s;tifiable in entering on a &s;eries of ma&s;&s;acres, the in|&s;tant they are pre&s;&s;ed by an enemy from without, what &s;afety can there be for any of us?

to wipe away the &s;tain on its principles, by a&s;cribing all the horrors tho&s;e principles have produced, to the gold di&s;tributed among the revolutioni&s;ts by the Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ter. The cruelties that have been com|mitted, were not, then, nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a free government; they were not the effect of irritation, of anarchical con|fu&s;ion, of vindictive retaliation; they were not the natural con&s;equence of a long-op|pre&s;&s;ed people's breaking their chains and ri&s;ing on their tyrants; all the&s;e excu&s;es (which I mu&s;t allow were &s;illy enough) are at once done away by this new ju&s;tification; for, we are here told, in &s;o many words, that the French people have &s;hed rivers of each other's blood, in every part of their dominions, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly for the love&mdash;not of <HI>li|berty,</HI> but of the <HI>gold of Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tural connection be|tween the mea&s;ures of the &s;everal National A&s;&s;emblies and the ma&s;&s;acres that were the immediate con&s;equence of them, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to effect a &s;eparation without the utmo&s;t violence to all manner of rea&s;oning and truth. If it was the gold of Pitt that paid for all the French blood that has been &s;pilled, it mu&s;t have been that gold that paid for the inhuman murder of Me&s;&s;rs.

to &s;anction the murder, by giving the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the&s;e gentlemen the title of <HI>heroes</HI> and <HI>conquerors,</HI> and by in&s;tituting a national fe&s;tival in their honour.</P>
<P>The Revolution was begun, and has hi|therto been maintained by the &s;hedding of innocent blood; therefore, if it was the gold of Pitt that paid for that blood, it is to the gold of Pitt that the revolution is to be a&s;|cribed, and not to that patriotic &s;pirit and love of liberty, with which we have been &s;o long amu&s;ed. In the fifth chapter of this work, it is inconte&s;tibly proved, that the &s;everal National A&s;&s;emblies authori&s;ed, or approved of all the ma&s;&s;acres which have di&s;|graced their country; if, then, the&s;e ma&s;|&s;acres were paid for by Mr. Pitt, mu&s;t we not inevitably conclude that the National A&s;&s;emblies were in the &s;ame pay? If Mr. Pitt paid for the blood of the family of Bourbon, for that of the king's guards, of the nobility, the clergy, the bankers, the merchants, in &s;hort, of all the rich or ari&s;to|crats, as they are called, it was Mr. Pitt who de&s;troyed the monarchy: it was he who cau&s;ed France to be called a Republic, and who gave ri&s;e to the doctrine of <HI>equali|ty.</HI> Tho&s;e, therefore, who talk of the gold of Pitt, mu&s;t cea&s;e all their ful&s;ome eu|logiums on the&s;e gallant republicans; for,
<PB N="152" REF="030205_0152_0FE5138FE64F1930">
if they are to have a republic, it will, ac|cording to their own confe&s;&s;ions, be the work of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>This vindication, throwing the blame on the gold of Pitt, amply participates in the misfortune of all the vindications that have lately appeared among&s;t us; that is, it takes up a bad cau&s;e, and makes it wor&s;e. The reader will certainly feel, with me, an in|expre&s;&s;ible indignation at a people, who, becau&s;e an ho&s;tile army was on their fron|tiers, could be prevailed on to butcher thou&s;ands upon thou&s;ands of their innocent countrymen; who could cut the throats of their fathers and mothers, rip up the bowels of women with child, and carry about the trophies of their ba&s;e and &s;avage triumph on the points of their pikes and bayonets; but, what will be his feelings, what will contain his &s;welling heart, when he is told, that all this was undertaken and perpetrated for fo|reign gold? The revolutioni&s;ts, by accu&s;ing Mr. Pitt of being at the bottom of their ma&s;&s;acres, do not perceive, without doubt, that they are heaping ten times ten-fold in|famy on them&s;elves and their nation.</P>
<P>By alledging this influence of Briti&s;h gold, the writer I have above quoted re|duces him&s;elf and the partizans of the re|volution to a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dilemma. He owns that rivers of French blood have flow|ed

at Paris, in the departments, on the frontiers, and in the colonies; and he tells us, that this blood was paid for with the gold of Pitt. Now, admitting this to be true, this blood has been &s;hed, and this gold received, by <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> To what, then, will our author a&s;cribe this &s;angui|nary avarice? He mu&s;t either a&s;cribe it to the <HI>natural di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of his countrymen; or, <HI>a change</HI> in that natural di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>produced by the revolution.</HI> It is uncertain which of the&s;e he may choo&s;e, but it is very certain, choo&s;e which he will, that he has held up the cha|racter of his nation, or the principles of the revolution to dete&s;tation, and abhorrence. This is the way he has ju&s;tified the French in the eyes of the people of this country. Infinitely better were it for &s;uch ju&s;tifiers to &s;uffer the pre&s;s to re&s;t in eternal inaction. All that a good Frenchman can do, is, to weep over the di&s;grace of his country; for, &s;o long as murder, horrid, barbarous, &s;a|vage murder, &s;hall admit of no excu&s;e, &s;o long &s;hall the actions of the French revo|lutioni&s;ts remain unju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>It is more than probable, that a writer of this &s;tamp might be willing to allow, that his countrymen were always naturally fero|cious and bloody-minded, rather than con|fe&s;s that this di&s;po&s;ition has been produced by the principles of the revolution: for,
<PB N="154" REF="030205_0154_0FE513916EED0408">
patriots of this kind are ever ready to &s;acri|fice the honour of their country to the &s;up|port of their &s;y&s;tems. But ju&s;tice demands from us to reject with di&s;dain every &s;uch conclu&s;ion. We have &s;een the French peo|ple &s;prightly, beneficent, humane and hap|py; let us, now, follow them &s;tep-by-&s;tep into the awful oppo&s;ite, and &s;ee for our|&s;elves, by what diabolical means the change has been effected.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t National A&s;&s;embly had hardly a&s;&s;umed that title, when they di&s;covered an intention of overturning the government, which they had been called together, and which their con&s;tituents had enjoined them, to &s;upport, and of levelling all ranks and di&s;tinctions among the different orders in the community. To this they were not led, as it has been &s;o fal&s;ely pretended, by their love of liberty and de&s;ire of &s;eeing their country happy; but by envy, cur&s;ed envy, that will never let the fiery demagogue &s;leep in peace, while he &s;ees a greater or richer than him&s;elf. It has been objected to this, that there were among the revolutioni&s;ts men who already enjoyed di&s;tingui&s;hed ho|nours; but it is forgotten at the &s;ame time, that ambition will be at the top, or no where; that it will de&s;troy it&s;elf with the envied object, rather than act a &s;ubaltern part. The motto of a demagogue is that

of Milton's Satan: "rather reign in hell than &s;erve in heaven."</P>
<P>This ta&s;k of de&s;truction was, however, an arduous one. To tear the complicated work of fourteen centuries to pieces at once, to render honours di&s;honourable, and turn reverential awe into contempt and mockery, was not to be accompli&s;hed but by extraor|dinary means. It was evident that proper|ty mu&s;t change hands, that the be&s;t blood of the nation mu&s;t flow in torrents, or the project mu&s;t fail. The A&s;&s;embly, to arm the multitude on their &s;ide, broached the popular doctrine of <HI>equality.</HI> It was a ne|ce&s;&s;ary part of the plan of the&s;e reformers to &s;educe the people to their &s;upport; and &s;uch was the credulity of the unfortunate French, that they &s;oon began to look on them as the oracles of virtue and wi&s;dom, and believed them&s;elves rai&s;ed, by one &s;hort &s;entence i&s;&s;ued by the&s;e ambitious impo&s;tors, from the &s;tate of <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> to that of <HI>&s;ove|reigns.</HI></P>

What dreadful carnage, what indelible di&s;grace, the nation would have e&s;caped! Hardly had the word <HI>equality</HI> been pronounced, when the whole kingdom became a &s;cene of anarchy and confu&s;ion. The name of liberty (I &s;ay the <HI>name,</HI> for the regenerated French have known nothing of it but the name) The name of liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> had already half turned the heads of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> people, and that of equality fini&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> work. From the moment it &s;ounded in their ears, all that had formerly in&s;pired r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;pect, all that they had reverenced and ado|red even, began to excite contempt and fu|ry. Birth, beauty, old age, all became the victims of a de&s;tructive equality, erected in|to a law by an A&s;&s;embly of ambitious ty|rants, who were ready to de&s;troy every thing that cro&s;&s;ed their way to ab&s;olute do|mination.</P>
<P>One of the immediate effects of the pro|mulgation of this doctrine was the murder of Mon&s;ieur Foulon and his &s;on-in-law Ber|thier, who, without &s;o much as being char|ged with any crime, were taken by the people, conducted to Paris and cruelly

In this manner they were carried through the &s;treets, followed by the exulting popu|lace (&s;ee <HI>Rabaut's</HI> Hi&s;t. Of the French Revolution, page 117.) Nor let it be pretended that the A&s;&s;embly could not pre|vent this &s;hameful, this bloody deed. They had the ab&s;olute command of Paris at the time, and had two hundred thou&s;and armed men ready to obey their nod. But the A&s;|&s;embly never oppo&s;ed the murder of tho&s;e whom they looked upon as their enemies; nay, Rabaut, their partial hi&s;torian (who was one of their body) even ju&s;tifies the murder.</P>
<P>When the word <HI>equality</HI> found its way to the colonies it was only a &s;ignal for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion. At Port-au-Prince the Chevalier de

Mauduit, a brave and generous officer, who rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to this country during the la&s;t war, was murdered by his own &s;oldiers. The villains had the in&s;olence to order him to kneel down before them: "No," &s;aid he, like a &s;oldier as he was, <Q>it &s;hall never be &s;aid, that Thomas Mau|duit bent his knee before a &s;et of &s;coun|drels,</Q> &mdash;His head was cut off; he was torn limb from limb; his bowels were trail|ed along the &s;treet, as butchers do tho&s;e of bea&s;ts in a &s;laughter hou&s;e.

<P>It was now that the &s;overeign people, enter|ing on their reign, fir&s;t took the famous plundering motto: <HI>"La guerre aux cha|teaux et la paix aux chaumi&eacute;res";</HI> that is, <HI>War to the gentlemen's hou&s;es and peace to the cottage;</HI> or, in other words, <HI>war to all tho&s;e who have any thing to lo&s;e.</HI> This motto is extremely comprehen&s;ive; it includes the whole doctrine of equality. It was not a vain declaration in France; but was put in practice with that patriotic zeal which
<PB N="159" REF="030205_0159_0FE513FEEFA44DE8">
has marked the whole cour&s;e of the revo|lution. To be rich or of a good family became a crime, which was often expiated by the lo&s;s of life. Men took as much pains to be thought ob&s;cure vagabonds, as they had formerly done to be thought wealthy and of hone&s;t de&s;cent; and, what di&s;tingui&s;hes the French revolution from all others in the world, to have a ragged pair of breeches, or to be totally in want of that &s;o nece&s;&s;ary article of dre&s;s, was e&s;|teemed the &s;ure&s;t mark of pure patrioti&s;m, and was the greate&s;t recommendation to public favour.</P>
<P>But the National A&s;&s;embly, though hear|tily &s;econded by myriads of ragged popu|lace, knew, however, that they could not long depend upon &s;uch a promi&s;cuous &s;upport. The citizens were, therefore, to be &s;oldiers at the &s;ame time, and placed under the command of the creatures of the A&s;&s;embly. To this end the territory of the nation un|derwent a new divi&s;ion, on the levelling plan. The provinces of France were melt|ed down into a rude undige&s;ted ma&s;s of de|partments, di&s;tricts, and municipalities. All the old magi&s;trates were replaced by the vile&s;t wretches that could be found. There were forty four thou&s;and municipalities, each of the&s;e had &s;everal municipal officers,
<PB N="160" REF="030205_0160_0FE5139F8D1FF470">
and each of the&s;e latter his troop of revolu|tionary myrmidons. There could not be le&s;s than <HI>three millions</HI> of men in arms, rea|dy to burn, cut and &s;lay at a moment's warning. Nothing was to be &s;een or heard but the patrolling of the&s;e &s;ons of equality. The A&s;&s;embly pretended to hold out the olive branch, while they were forming the nation into a camp. The peaceable man trembled for his life. One mu&s;t have been an eye witne&s;s of the change produced by the&s;e mea&s;ures, to have the lea&s;t idea of it. All was &s;u&s;picion and dread. The bell that had never rung but to call the peaceful vil|lagers to the altar, was converted into a &s;ignal of approaching danger, and the tree, beneath which they formerly danced, be|came an alarm po&s;t. The ragged grea&s;y magi&s;trates, with their municipal troops at their heels, were for ever prowling about for their prey, the property of others. The&s;e little platoons of cut-throats ranged the country round, crying havock burning and laying wa&s;te where ever they came. They had not yet begun to murder frequently, but it was little con&s;equence to a man whe|ther his brains were blowed out or not, af|ter having &s;een him&s;elf and family reduced, in the &s;pace of a few hours, from affluence to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ggary.

Would you break all the bands of &s;ociety a&s;under, and turn a civilized people into a horde of &s;ava|ges? This is all done by the comprehen&s;ive word equality.&mdash;But they tell us, we are not to take it in the unqualified &s;en&s;e. In what &s;en&s;e are we to take it then? Either it means &s;omething more than liberty, or it means nothing at all. The mi&s;con&s;truction of the word liberty has done mi&s;chief enough in the world; to add to it a word of a &s;till more dangerous extent, was to kindle a flame that never can be extingui&s;h|ed but by the total deba&s;ement, if not de|&s;truction, of the &s;ociety, who are &s;illy or wicked enough to adopt its u&s;e.

<P>The civil di&s;organization of the &s;tate was but the forerunner of tho&s;e cur&s;es which the A&s;&s;embly had in &s;tore for their devoted country.

The more effectually to de&s;troy the chri&s;tian religion altogether, they began by &s;apping the foundations of the catholic faith, the only one that the people had been taught to revere. They formed a &s;chi&s;m with the

church of Rome, well knowing that the opinions of the vulgar, once &s;et afloat, were as likely to fix on athei&s;m as on any other &s;y&s;tem; and more &s;o, as being le&s;s oppo&s;ed to their levelling principles than the rigid though &s;imple morality of the go&s;pel. A religion that teaches obedience to the higher powers, inculcates humility and peace, &s;trictly forbids robbery and murder, and, in &s;hort, enjoins on men to do as they would be done unto, could by no means &s;uit the armed ru&s;&s;ians, who were to accompli&s;h the views of the French A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The pre&s;s, which was made free for the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, lent mo&s;t powerful aid to the&s;e de&s;tructive reformers.

The mini&s;ters of divine wor&s;hip, of every &s;ect and denomination, were repre|&s;ented as cheats, and as the avowed enemies of the &s;ublime and &s;entimental &s;omething, which the A&s;&s;embly had in &s;tore for the re|generation of the world.</P>

Before his time was ex|pired he decamped, fled into the dominions of the king of Sardinia, where he changed the pre&s;byterian for the catholic religion. This beginning &s;eemed to promi&s;e fair for what followed. By an unexpected turn of fortune he became a footman, in which ca|pacity he did not forget his old habit of &s;tealing.

<P>Having thus prepared the public mind, the A&s;&s;embly made a bold attack on the church.

<P>To obtain the &s;anction of the people to this act, they were told, that the wealth of the church would not only pay off the na|tional debt, but render taxes in future un|nece&s;&s;ary. No deception was ever &s;o bare faced as this; but even this was not want|ed; for the people them&s;elves had already begun to ta&s;te the &s;weets of plunder.

In vain were they told, that the purcha&s;er would partake in the infamy of the robbery; that, if the title of the communities could not render property &s;ecure, that &s;ame property could never be &s;ecure under any title the plunderers could give. In vain were they told, that in &s;anc|tioning the &s;ei&s;ure of the wealth of others, they were &s;anctioning the &s;ei&s;ure of their

<P>I have dwelt the longer on this &s;ubject, as it is, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;triking and mo&s;t awful example of the con&s;equences of a vio|lation of property, that the world ever &s;aw.

From this act of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly we may date the violation, in France, of every right that men ought to hold dear. Hence the &s;eizure of all gold and &s;ilver as the property of the nation: hence the law preventing the &s;on to claim the wealth of his father: hence the abomi|nable tyranny of requi&s;itions; and hence thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands of the murders, that have di&s;graced unhappy France.</P>
<P>Since the &s;eizure of the church-e&s;tates, there has not, in fact, been any &s;uch thing as private property in France; for, though the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly did not pa&s;s a decree of this import, they knew perfectly well how to pa&s;s decrees and e&s;tabli&s;h regu|lations amounting to the &s;ame thing. Some of their enormous contributions on the rich, were called <HI>patriotic gifts;</HI> but he who refu|&s;ed to pay the <HI>gift</HI> in&s;erted in the li&s;t, knew
<PB N="185" REF="030205_0185_0FE4FDA48FE5AFD8">
he had but a few hours to live. The mo|ney and jewels, depo&s;ited at the bar of the A&s;&s;embly and on the altar of the country, amounted to immen&s;e &s;ums. The&s;e were held out as a proof of a general approbation of their mea&s;ures; but had the A&s;&s;embly been candid, they would have confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e offerings were the pure effect of fear, of a panic that had &s;eized all the pro|prietors in the nation, and that each giver's hatred to their cau&s;e might be mea&s;ured by the &s;um he depo&s;ited. It was not a grate|ful free-will offering, but a &s;acrifice, that the trembling wretch came to offer at the &s;hrine of tyranny, in order to &s;ave his hou&s;e from the flames, or his own head, or that of &s;ome dear relation or parent, from the &s;caffold.

On the 13th of March, 1794, all the Merchants of Bourdeaux (known for one of the mo&s;t infamou&s;ly patriotic towns in the kingdom) were arre&s;ted in one day, and condemned, in pre&s;ence of the guillo|tine, to a fine of <HI>one hundred millions</HI> of French livres, upwards of <HI>four millions &s;ter|ling.</HI> On the 18th of April, the rich Bank|er, La Bord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, after having <HI>purcha&s;ed his life eight times,</HI> was guillotined, and the re|mainder

of his riches confi&s;cated. On the 10th of May, twenty &s;even rich Farm|ers-General were executed, becau&s;e they had ama&s;&s;ed riches under the monarchy. Finally, on the 27th of June, all property, of whatever de&s;cription, was decreed <HI>to be|long to the nation,</HI> and was put in a &s;tate of requi&s;ition accordingly, as the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the whole of the inhabitants had been be|fore.</P>
<P>The milk-and-water admirers of the Con|&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly pretend to be &s;hocked at the&s;e mea&s;ures; but, what are the&s;e mea|&s;ures more than an improvement on tho&s;e of that A&s;&s;embly? The progre&s;s was not only natural, but even nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;up|port of the revolution. Had there been &s;till church-e&s;tates to &s;eize, und monks to murder, it is probable, that the tyrants, who have &s;ucceeded the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;em|bly, would not have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their prede|ce&s;&s;ors; but, that &s;ource being exhau&s;ted, they were obliged to find out others, or re|turn to order and obedience. And, I &s;hould be glad to know, if the property of one individual, or one &s;ociety, was become the property of the &s;overeign people by vir|tue of a decree of one A&s;&s;embly, why the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> claim &s;hould not be made to the pro|perty of other individuals, or other &s;ocieties. Nor can I believe, whatever Athei&s;ts and
<PB N="187" REF="030205_0187_0FE5144FDF04CFA8">
Dei&s;ts may &s;ay to the contrary, that it was any more unju&s;t to guillotine Bankers and Merchants, or even <HI>members of the Con&s;titu|ent A&s;&s;embly,</HI> than to guillotine or ma&s;&s;acre poor, defencele&s;s, friendle&s;s Prie&s;ts. There is &s;uch an intimate connection between the &s;ecurity of property, and that of the per&s;on to whom that property belongs, that one can never be &s;aid to be &s;afe, while the other is in danger. Tyrant princes, tyrant a&s;&s;em|blies, or tyrant mobs, when once they are &s;uffered to take away with impunity the pro|perty of the innocent man, will feel little &s;cruple at taking away his life al&s;o. Rob|bery and murder are the natural auxiliaries of each other, and, with a people rendered ferocious and hardened by an infidel &s;y&s;tem that removes all fear of an hereafter, they mu&s;t for ever be in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>Before the decree was pa&s;&s;ed for the a&s;|&s;umption of the e&s;tates of the regular clergy, every calumny that fal&s;hood could invent, and every vexation that Tyranny could en|force, were employed to deba&s;e the whole body of the clergy and the religion they taught.

Some pretext or other was never wanting to ex|cite the mob to put an end to him and his re&s;i&s;tance. Chatel, Mayor of St. Denys was one of this de&s;cription. The mob were told that this man was the cau&s;e of the dear|ne&s;s of bread.

The rabble were di&s;per&s;ing; but they had not fulfilled the bloody wi&s;hes of the revolutionary agents, who had nothing le&s;s in view than the lowering of the price of bread.

<P>Things were not &s;uffered to remain long in this &s;tate. The Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly well knew, that they and religion could never exi&s;t for any length of time in the &s;ame country. The parochial clergy were

men of talents and indu&s;try. They gene|rally decided all the little di&s;putes between their pari&s;hioners; to which amicable capa|city, they often joined that of phy&s;ician or &s;urgeon; and the&s;e their beneficent &s;ervices were always rendered without fee or reward. Even the athei&s;ts and dei&s;ts them&s;elves had repeatedly acknowledged their virtuous mode&s;ty, and the great utility they were of to the community at large. Such a body of men, immoveably attached to the reli|gion they taught, was truly formidable to the new tyrants. Religion had received a &s;evere blow; but, if the&s;e men retained their cures, it might recover. Nay, what was &s;till more dreadful, the monarchy it|&s;elf might recover along with it; and it is not difficult to conceive, how an idea like this mu&s;t haunt the minds of the pupils of the &s;avage and impious Diderot, who hoped to &s;ee <Q>the la&s;t of kings &s;trangled with the guts of the la&s;t of prie&s;ts.</Q> In &s;hort, the parochial clergy, were the only men on earth they had now to fear, and the&s;e they got rid of by a &s;tratagem worthy of an A&s;|&s;embly, the leaders of which joined to the mo&s;t hardened wickedne&s;s, the profounde&s;t di&s;&s;imulation.</P>

<P>It might be &s;ufficient to &s;ay of this latter con&s;titution, that it was ju&s;t as &s;ubver&s;ive of religion as their other con&s;titution was of every principle of government and &s;ound po|licy. They knew it to be in direct oppo&s;i|tion to the very nature of the catholic reli|gion: yet they had the a&s;&s;urance to tell the people, that it was not; they even went &s;o far as to prote&s;t, that they would live and die in the religion of their forefathers, at the very moment when they were taking the &s;ure&s;t mea&s;ure in the world for de&s;troying it. They were led to this hypocritical de|claration from a fear that the body of the people were not yet ripe for a total abolition of religion, and, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;e|quel, this fear was not entirely unfounded. By per&s;uading the people, that nothing was intended again&s;t their faith, they had an ad|ditional handle again&s;t the clergy, by repre|&s;enting

them as unfriendly to their "Civil Con&s;titution," merely becau&s;e it was nece&s;|&s;ary to the &s;upport of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>This in&s;trument did not, however, pa&s;s into a law, without con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance. There were yet &s;ome hone&s;t and virtuous men even among the members of the Con|&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly. The&s;e had remained with them, not to aid in overturning the government, and effecting the dreadful revolution that has &s;ince rendered the coun|try a &s;laughter-hou&s;e, but to oppo&s;e the de|&s;tructive mea&s;ures of the philo&s;ophers, and, if po&s;&s;ible &s;ave the &s;inking &s;tate. At the head of the&s;e was the learned and eloquent Abb&eacute; Maury. He oppo&s;ed this "Civil Con&s;titution," with all the powers of rea|&s;oning and all the charms of eloquence: but it was ca&s;ting pearls before &s;wine. When was an athei&s;t open to conviction. The de|cree pa&s;&s;ed, and was &s;oon after followed by another, obliging the clergy to &s;wear to ob|&s;erve and maintain the "Civil Con&s;titu|tion." This oath they could not take without breaking that which they had taken at entering into the prie&s;thood; and that the A&s;&s;embly had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they would not do. Whether they did or not, however, the end of their tyrants was an&s;wered: if they refu&s;ed, they were to be driven from their livings; if they complied,

they mu&s;t be looked upon as apo&s;tates, and be de&s;erted by all tho&s;e who were &s;till attach|ed to them. In either ca&s;e the tottering re|mains of religion mu&s;t come to the ground.

<P>The A&s;&s;embly were di&s;concerted by this firm re&s;i&s;tance on the part of the clergy? they knew the clergy in general would ne|ver take the oath, but they did not imagine

that tho&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, would, amid&s;t the vociferations of their cannibals, have the courage to give &s;uch a po&s;itive de|nial. For a moment they felt aba&s;hed; but they were gone too far to think of re|treating. The apo&s;tate Abb&eacute; Gregoire, whom we have &s;ince &s;een among&s;t the or|ganizers of a pagan fe&s;tival, was, on this occa&s;ion cho&s;en to convince the clergy, that the oath might be taken, without any vio|lation of their faith. After this, in order to deprive the clergy of an opportunity of defending their opinions in oppo&s;ition to the oath, they were ordered to advance and take it at once. This decree had no effect: not a man advanced. Now the matter was brought to a point: the decree for enforcing the oath mu&s;t be repealed, or the clergy mu&s;t be driven from their livings, and tho&s;e in the A&s;&s;embly from their feats. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that the latter was adopted: one tyrannical mea&s;ure is the na|tural and inevitable con&s;equence of another.</P>
<P>A decree was now pa&s;&s;ed for the expul|&s;ion of all the non-juring bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts, and for the choo&s;ing of others in their &s;tead. From this day, it may be &s;aid, there was no &s;uch thing as an e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in France. The ax had long been laid to the root of the tree; it was ready to fall, and this &s;troke levelled it with the earth.</P>

But, the &s;truggle was that of religion again&s;t irreligion, that of chri&s;|tianity again&s;t athei&s;m.</P>

per&s;ecution, the former, it was to be hoped, would return without the latter; but, in the mean time, the prote&s;tants were happy in not only being tolerated in the exerci&s;e of their religion, but al&s;o on being rendered capable of enjoying every privilege and advantage which the catholics them&s;elves enjoy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are not allowed tho&s;e advantages, re&s;umed the clergyman, from any regard they bear to our religion, but from a to|tal indifference of their own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whatever may be the ca&s;e, replied I, the effect is the &s;ame with regard to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, &s;aid he, the effect might be bet|ter, not only with re&s;pect to us, but to all France; for the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution might have di&s;appeared, without an in|difference for all religion coming in its place: and in that ca&s;e there would have been more probability of the true reli|gion gaining ground; for it is ea&s;ier to draw men from an erroneous doctrine to a true one, than to impre&s;s the truths of religion on minds which de&s;pi&s;e all religion whatever.</Q></P>

<P>This fact fully proves, that prote&s;tants can be as cruel as catholics.

<P>The in&s;tallment of the new prie&s;ts was commonly, not to &s;ay always, attended with tumult and violence. Many of their predece&s;&s;ors were knocked down, &s;tabbed, or &s;hot, at their church doors, the day, or day after, they had refu&s;ed to conform. The prie&s;t of the village of Spet-Saux, while he was explaining to his pari&s;hioners his rea|&s;ons for refu&s;ing to take the oath, received

<P>Where there was no re&s;i&s;tance but on the part of the prie&s;t, an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination put an end to the &s;truggle; but, in &s;ome places, the re&s;i&s;tance was more general. The pari|&s;hioners were divided; one part the champions of the apo&s;tate, and the other, tho&s;e of the old prie&s;t. Church time was the moment for deciding the&s;e di&s;putes, and the Church-yard the field of action. The&s;e affrays were often bloody; victory &s;ometimes leaned to the &s;ide of ju&s;tice; but, as the apo&s;tate appeared in per&s;on at the head of his troops, as he had the young peo|ple generally on his &s;ide, and always the mob and municipal officers, with their na|tional guards, he &s;eldom failed to keep the field. Some of the&s;e wretches have been &s;een conducted to the altar to the &s;ound of drums and trumpets, at the very moment when their partizans were murdering on the out&s;ide of the church.</P>
<P>The expelling of the parochial clergy tried the real &s;entiments of the body of the French people more than any one act of their tyrants ever did, before or &s;ince. Ge|nerally &s;peaking, the trial was honourable to them; for, if we except Paris, and &s;ome other places immediately under the influ|ence of the revolutionary clubs, they wi&s;h|ed

to retain their ancient pa&s;tors, and did not &s;cruple to declare that wi&s;h, notwith|&s;tanding the vociferations of hundreds of mob in the pay of the A&s;&s;embly; not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e petty a&s;&s;emblies of &s;ubaltern tyrants, called municipal officers, who came to order them to receive an apo&s;|tate, <HI>in the name of the law;</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing thou&s;ands of &s;pies and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, ever ready to betray and murder them; in &s;pite of all the&s;e, whole pari&s;hes flocked round their prie&s;ts, pre&s;&s;ed them to continue, fol|lowed them to the fields, and left the apo&s;|tates to &s;ay ma&s;s to the bare walls. Many of the latter, though they continued to re|ceive the revolutionary &s;alary for upwards of two years, never could boa&s;t of above three or four voluntary hearers.</P>
<P>Wherever this ob&s;tinate attachment to religion appeared, the A&s;&s;embly knew how to make the refractory feel their authority. True tyrants, they &s;uffered no one to thwart their will with impunity. Property, honour, con&s;cience, all mu&s;t yield to their &s;ultanic decrees!</P>
<P>Condorcet, the athei&s;t Condorcet, pro|po&s;ed flagellation; and this was pretty com|monly inflicted on the women and children who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ma&s;&s;es of the non-juring clergy. The Abb&eacute; Barruel (page 79 of the
<PB N="212" REF="030205_0212_0FE4FE7F1BD53A98">
French edition) tells us, that three &s;i&s;ters of one of the Charity-hou&s;es at Paris, expired under the rods of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Ungrateful mon&s;ters! the lives of the&s;e women had been totally devoted to the &s;ervice of the &s;ick, the lame and the blind. By their vow they were excluded from the plea&s;ures of the world, without being excluded from its pains. They had made a voluntary &s;urren|der of all they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had a&s;&s;umed the garb, and &s;ubmitted to the au&s;terities of the mona&s;tic life, in order to devote them|&s;elves to the mournful occupation of attend|ing on the <HI>poor</HI> who laboured under infirmi|ties. It was &s;aid, they did this to &s;ecure them&s;elves, a place in heaven; and mo&s;t certainly they took the &s;ure&s;t way. I feel a reluctance to call &s;uch people <HI>&s;uper&s;titious;</HI> for, if they were &s;o, their &s;uper&s;tition was of a mo&s;t amiable kind, and &s;urely nothing &s;hort of the principles of this helli&s;h revolu|tion could have hardened the hearts of men to &s;courge them to death, and that merely becau&s;e they would not di&s;grace them&s;elves by receiving the &s;acrament from the conta|minated hands of an apo&s;tate.</P>
<P>It were endle&s;s to enumerate all the dif|ferent &s;orts of per&s;ecution exerci&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who remained attached to their reli|gion. Little children were beaten half to death; the hair and ears of women were

cut off; they were mounted on a&s;&s;es, and led about in the mo&s;t un&s;eemly and &s;hocking gui&s;e. The in&s;tance of John Can|tabel de&s;erves particular notice. Cantabel was an hone&s;t pea&s;ant, &s;incerely attached to the religion of his fathers. He happened to have a little catechi&s;m which had been pub|li&s;hed by the non-juring clergy; it was found in his hou&s;e; and this was a &s;ufficient crime. A committee of municipal officers ordered the catechi&s;m to be burnt; a great fire was made; Cantabel was brought forth, and commanded to throw the book into it. "No," &s;ays the heroic pea&s;ant, <Q>it contains the principles of my religion; it has been my guide and my comfort, and it now gives me the courage to tell you, that I will never commit it to the flames.</Q> Upon this he was threatened, but &s;till he remained re&s;olute. One of the ruffians &s;eized a flaming torch, and held it under his hand. "Burn on," &s;aid he, <Q>you may burn not only my hand, but my whole body, before I will do any thing to di&s;honour my religion.</Q> He was afterwards mounted on a hor&s;e, his back to the head, and the tail in his hand, and was thus conducted about amid&s;t the &s;houts of the rabble. The vile wretches, when tired with their &s;port, &s;uffered him to creep home, more dead than alive.&mdash;This is the <HI>liberty of

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the partial oppo&s;ition the apo&s;tates met with, and the horror their conduct, as well as their mini&s;try ex|cited in all good minds, they, at la&s;t, found them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the churches, to the exclu&s;ion of the ancient prie&s;ts. Such of the&s;e latter as had e&s;caped death, were now bereft of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; they were therefore obliged to become a charge to their faithful pari&s;hioners. Had there been any &s;uch things as toleration and liber|ty under the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, the&s;e unfortunate men might &s;till have found a retreat among&s;t their wealthy neighbours, that would have left them no rea&s;on to re|gret the lo&s;s of their &s;alaries. But the greate&s;t part of their wealthy neighbours were already reduced to their own &s;ituation, and tho&s;e who were not, knew that the re|ception of a non-juring prie&s;t would amount to a proof of <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> &s;ufficient to lead

them to the guillotine. The expul&s;ed prie&s;ts were, then, obliged to take &s;helter in &s;ome ob&s;cure and mi&s;erable cabin, and often was the terror &s;o great, that, like per&s;ons infec|ted with the plague, no one would admit them beneath his roof.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and humili|ation, &s;ome fled in di&s;gui&s;e to the countries &s;urrounding France; &s;ome to rece&s;&s;es in the fore&s;ts, whither the pea&s;ants of the neigh|bourhood brought them the means of exi&s;|tence. Numbers, however, &s;till remained in their towns and villages. Seeing the whole country &s;warming with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, they thought, perhaps, they might as well wait the &s;tab in their own pari&s;hes as to &s;eek it at a di&s;tance. Many, too, from age and infir|mity, were ab&s;olutely incapable of travel|ling; and, be&s;ides the &s;mall remainder of a life &s;o full of bitterne&s;s, could not, with &s;uch men, be an object of &s;ufficient impor|tance to induce them to abandon tho&s;e of their pari&s;hioners, who &s;till &s;ought their ad|vice and con&s;olation. Some were retained by their affection to their relations, or their parents; it is &s;o hard to break the bands of nature, to tear one&s;elf from all one holds dear, that the ri&s;k of death in competition with &s;uch a &s;eparation, lo&s;es half its terrors.</P>

to &s;ecret them&s;elves, and though, to ap|pearances, generally &s;hunned, were re&s;orted to by great numbers, particularly of the el|derly people. I have already ob&s;erved, that, among the youth, there was a pretty gene|ral bias toward the apo&s;tates. Hence en|&s;ued &s;uch &s;cenes of divi&s;ion and per&s;ecution as no country on earth except France ever witne&s;&s;ed. Friends were divided again&s;t friends; one branch of a family again&s;t another. It often happened that the parents treated their children as apo&s;tates, and the children their parents as ari&s;tocrats; quar|rels and blood&s;hed were as often the con&s;e|quences. We have &s;een (page 29 of <HI>this volume</HI>) a &s;on cut off the heads of his fa|ther and mother, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to attend at the ma&s;s of an apo&s;tate, carry the heads to his club, and receive applau&s;es for the deed. Acts like this were not frequent; but others very near approaching it, were not only frequent but general. Sons, and even daughters, have been known to beat and lacerate their parents in the mo&s;t cruel manner. Hundreds of both &s;exes have been led to pri&s;on and publicly accu&s;ed by their children.

Their churches re&s;embled guard-hou&s;es, rather than places of divine wor|&s;hip.

I &s;aw &s;everal women running by the inn where I had put up; they all &s;eemed much

alarmed. I a&s;ked the landlord what was the matter: he told me that the revolu|tionary prie&s;t, provoked to find that none of the village attended at his ma&s;s, had been that morning to <HI>Ville D' Eu</HI> for a party of national guards, to aid him in driving the former prie&s;t from a little cottage, where he and his mother had taken &s;helter. The man gave me a mo&s;t affecting account of this good prie&s;t, who was upwards of four&s;core years of age, and who had been the rector of that place for more than fifty years. On the day he was to deliver his cure into the hands of the apo&s;tate, he &s;ummoned his little flock to meet him in the church for the la&s;t time. Not a &s;oul was ab&s;ent: old or young. The women carried their infants in their arms, and two old people, not able to walk were carried on couches. <HI>My children,</HI> &s;ays the old man, <HI>I have pre&s;|&s;ed your tender hands on the bapti&s;mal font: I have &s;ung the requiem for the &s;ouls of your fathers: I mu&s;t now bid you an eter|nal farewel, deprived of the con&s;olation of leaving my a&s;hes among&s;t you.</HI>&mdash;Here he cea&s;ed; tears &s;tifled his voice: the &s;obs and cries of his audience rendered the &s;cene too much for him.&mdash;While the land|lord was &s;peaking, we heard a di&s;charge of mu&s;kets, and a loud &s;hriek of woman.
<PB N="220" REF="030205_0220_0FE5145F848DD908">
We ran to the &s;pot. The pea&s;ants of the village, about forty in number, had a&s;|&s;embled round the cottage with clubs to defend their pa&s;tor; but, the enemy hav|ing fire arms, they had been obliged to give way, leaving two of their compani|ons dead and &s;everal wounded. I now beheld a fight &s;ufficient to melt the heart of a tyger. Two ruffians of the national guard were dragging out this venerable old man by the hair of his head, by tho&s;e locks as white as &s;now. He had received a wound in his cheek, from which the blood ran down on his gar|ments. In this &s;ituation was he led off, bare headed and bare footed, towards <HI>Ville D' Eu,</HI> while his poor old parent, who had been many years blind and dumb, remained on her bed, happily in|&s;en&s;ible of the &s;orrows of her &s;on. As the villains pulled him along, all the words he was heard to utter, were, My Mother! Oh!

<P>By means like the&s;e, the old clergy and their adherents were extirpated, and reli|gion along with them.

<P>Indeed, that their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have only fulfilled their wi&s;hes, in this re&s;pect, there can be no doubt, if any judgment of the wi&s;hes of men is to be formed from their principles, their words and their actions. Who, I a&s;k, that wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve religion, would have pa&s;&s;ed a decree for the expul&s;ion of every prie&s;t that refu&s;ed to for&s;wear him|&s;elf? who, that did not wi&s;h to de&s;troy re|ligion, would have pa&s;&s;ed a decree for com|mitting it to the care of apo&s;tates? Was it not clear, that &s;uch men would &s;tick at nothing? That, at the nod of their ma&s;ters, they would at any time be ready to bla&s;|pheme the God they pretended to adore? On the contrary, the A&s;&s;embly knew, that there was no hope of their &s;y&s;tem taking root, while the ancient clergy remained in their cures. Among men, who gave up their all, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to almo&s;t certain death, rather than fal&s;ify their faith, they could not hope to find a <HI>Gobet.</HI> They
<PB N="226" REF="030205_0226_0FE5146493B8B4C0">
could not hope to find &s;upple villains that would voluntarily depo&s;e the emblems of their religion on the altar of a &s;trumpet, and confe&s;s them&s;elves to have been the crafty mini&s;ters of an <HI>arch impo&s;tor.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The oath tendered to the clergy was the touch-&s;tone; it was to prove them; to know whom the A&s;&s;embly could depend on for the accompli&s;hment of their projects, and whom they could not depend on. The enforcing of the oath was the la&s;t blow to public religion in France, and therefore the de&s;truction of that religion, with all its im|moral and murderous con&s;equences, is due to the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, and to them alone. It is as non&s;en&s;ical as unju&s;t to ac|cu&s;e this or that faction, or even the Con|vention it&s;elf, of exchanging Chri&s;tianity for a &s;y&s;tem of pagani&s;m; infidels who adore an idol are as good as infidels who adore none; and where is the difference, whether the adored idol be Jean Jacques Rou&s;&s;eau or Madame Memoro? An adul|tre&s;s is as good a godde&s;s as an adulterer is a god at any time.</P>
<P>Let the reader now look back, and he will ea&s;ily trace all the horrors of the French Revolution to the decrees of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly. It was they that rent the government to pieces; it was they that fir&s;t broached the de&s;tructive doctrine
<PB N="227" REF="030205_0227_0FE5146E8394D6F0">
of equality; it was they that de&s;troyed all ideas of private property; and finally, it was they that rendered the people hardened, by effacing from their minds every principle of the only religion capable of keeping man|kind within the bounds of ju&s;tice and hu|manity. Look al&s;o at their particular ac|tions, and you will &s;ee them breaking their oaths to their con&s;tituents and to their king; you will &s;ee their agents driving people from their e&s;tates, beating and killing them; you will &s;ee them &s;urrounded with a &s;et of hireling writers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, employed to degrade and murder peaceable people at|tached to the religion of their forefathers; and you will &s;ee them not only pardoning murders, in &s;pite of their poor humiliated monarch, but even receiving the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins at their bar, covering them with applau&s;es, and in&s;tituting fe&s;tivals in their honour. What have the members of the Convention and their agents done more than this? They have murdered in greater numbers. True; but what have numbers to do with the matter? The principle on which tho&s;e murders were committed was ever the &s;ame; it was more or le&s;s active as occa&s;ion requir|ed. The wants of the Convention were more pre&s;&s;ing than tho&s;e of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly. The A&s;&s;embly were not driven to the expedient of <HI>requi&s;itions,</HI> nor was
<PB N="228" REF="030205_0228_0FE51470274690C0">
the hour yet arrived for the promulgation of the pagani&s;h calendar. Con&s;equently they met with le&s;s oppo&s;ition, and therefore le&s;s murders were nece&s;&s;ary; but, had they continued their fittings to this day the de|va&s;tation of every kind would have been the fame that it has been.</P>
<P>The whole hi&s;tory of the revolution pre|&s;ents us with nothing but a regular progre&s;s in robbery and murder. The fir&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly, for in&s;tance, begin by flattering the mob, wheedling their king out of his title and his power; they then &s;et him at defiance pro|&s;cribe or put to death his friends; and then &s;hut him up in his palace, as a wild bea&s;t in a cage. The &s;econd A&s;&s;embly &s;end a gang of ruffians to in&s;ult and revile him, and then they hurl him from his throne. The third A&s;&s;embly cut his throat. What is there in all this but a regular and na|tural progre&s;&s;ion from bad to wor&s;e. And &s;o with the re&s;t of their abominable actions.</P>
<P>To throw the blame on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the fir&s;t de&s;potic A&s;&s;embly is &s;uch a perver|&s;ion of rea&s;on, &s;uch an abandonment of truth, that no man, who has a &s;ingle grain of &s;en&s;e, can hear of with patience. As well might we a&s;cribe all the murders com|mitted at Nantz to the under cut-throats, by whom they were perpetrated, and not to the Convention by who&s;e order, and un|der
<PB N="229" REF="030205_0229_0FE4FDBEF7BADC68">
who&s;e protection, the&s;e cut-throats acted. The Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly knew the con&s;equences of their decrees, as well as Foucault (<HI>See page</HI> 66) knew the con&s;e|quence of his order for throwing forty wo|men from the cliff Pierre-moine into the &s;ea; and it is full as ridiculous to hear them pretend, that they did not wi&s;h tho&s;e con|&s;equences to follow, as it would be to hear Foucault pretend, that he did not wi&s;h the forty women &s;hould be drowned. True, the Convention are guilty of every crime under heaven: a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and bla&s;phemers mu&s;t ever merit dete&s;tation and abhorrence, from whatever motive they may act, or by whom&s;oever taught and in&s;tigated; but &s;till the pre-eminence in infamy is due to their teachers and in&s;tigators: the Convention is, in relation to the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, what the ignorant de&s;perate bravo is in re|lation to his crafty and &s;culking employer.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, it may not be impro|per, as I have hitherto &s;poken of the Con|&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly in a general way, to make &s;ome di&s;tinctions with re&s;pect to the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed it. I am very far from holding them all up as objects of ab|horrence, or even of cen&s;ure. There were many, very many, men of great wi&s;dom and virtue, who were elected to the Sates-General, and even who joined the A&s;&s;em|bly,

after it a&s;&s;umed the epithet <HI>National.</HI> It would be the height of inju&s;tice to re|proach the&s;e men with the con&s;equences of mea&s;ures, which they oppo&s;ed with &s;uch uncommon eloquence and courage. Hi&s;to|ry will make honourable mention of their names, when the epitome I have here at|tempted will be lo&s;t and forgotten. Suffice it then to &s;ay, that the weight of our cen|&s;ure, of the cen&s;ure of all ju&s;t and good men, ought to fall on tho&s;e licentious poli|ticians and infidel philo&s;ophers alone, who &s;anctioned the decree for the annihilation of property and religion.</P>
<P>Here, too, we ought to dive&s;t our&s;elves of every thing of a per&s;onal or party na|ture, and direct our abhorrence to princi|ples alone. As to the actors, they have, in general, already expiated their wicked|ne&s;s or folly by the lo&s;s of their lives. We have &s;een the athei&s;t Condorcet obliged to fly in di&s;gui&s;e from the capital, the inhabi|tants of which he had corrupted, and by whom he had been adored as the great lu|minary of the age: we have &s;een him a&s;|&s;ume the garb and the &s;upplicating tone of a common beggar, lurking in the lanes and woods, like a hou&s;ele&s;s thief, and, at la&s;t, literally dying in a ditch, leaving his car|ca&s;e a prey to the fowls of the air, and his memory as a le&s;&s;on to future apo&s;tles of

Scores, not to &s;ay hundreds, of his coadjutors have &s;hared a fate little different from his own; and tho&s;e who have not, can have little rea&s;on to congratu|late them&s;elves on their e&s;cape. The tornado they had rai&s;ed for the de&s;truction of others, has &s;wept them from the &s;eat of their tyran|ny, and &s;cattered them over every corner of the earth. Tho&s;e haughty u&s;urpers who refu&s;ed the precedence to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Charlemagne, are now obliged to yield it to a pea&s;ant or a porter. They who de|creed, that the "Folding-Doors of the Louvre &s;hould fly open at their approach," are now glad to lift the latch of a wicket, and bend their heads beneath the thatch of a cabin. And, what language can expre&s;s the vexation, the angui&s;h, the cutting re|flections, that mu&s;t be the companions of their ob&s;curity! When they look back on their di&s;tracted country, when they behold the widows, the orphans, the thou&s;ands and hundreds of thou&s;ands of murdered victims, that it pre&s;ents; when they behold the frantic people, carrying the dagger to the hearts of their parents, nay, digging their forefathers from their graves, and throwing their a&s;hes to the winds; when they behold all this, and reflect that it is the work of their own hands, well might

<P>Now, what is the advantage we ought to derive from the awful example before us?&mdash;It ought to produce in us a watchful|ne&s;s, and a &s;teady re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the advances of di&s;organizing and infidel princi|ples. I am aware that it will be &s;aid by &s;ome, that all fear of the progre&s;s of the&s;e principles is imaginary; but, con&s;tant ob|&s;ervation a&s;&s;ures me, that it is but too well founded. Let any man examine the change in political and religious opinions &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the general government, and particularly the change crept in along with our &s;illy admiration of the French Revolution, and &s;ee if the re&s;ult of his in|quiries, does not ju&s;tify a fear of our falling under the &s;courge, that has brought a hap|py and gallant people on their knees, and left them bleeding at every pore.</P>

A combination of circum&s;tances, &s;uch as, perhaps, never before met together, has &s;o &s;oured the minds of the great ma&s;s of the people in this country, has worked up their hatred again&s;t Great Britain to &s;uch a pitch, that the in&s;tant that nation is named, they lo&s;e not only their temper but their rea&s;on al&s;o. The dictates of nature and the exerci&s;e of judgment are thrown a&s;ide: whatever the Briti&s;h adopt mu&s;t be rejected, and whatever they reject mu&s;t be adopted. Hence it is, that all the execrable acts of the French legi&s;lators, not forgetting their murders and their bla&s;phemy, have met with the mo&s;t unqualified applau&s;es, merely becau&s;e they were execrated in the i&s;land of Britain.</P>
