<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_MY de&s;ign in the following papers is, to endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h a right Notion of Government from natural and certain Principles; a Work at fir&s;t view not very ea&s;y to be done, con&s;idering how much men differ on this &s;ubject, and how intricate and intangled they have made it.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the many that have wrote upon this Point, there are but few who agree in the &s;ame Scheme; and a+mong&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="014023_0005_0F92AE38D0BFD780">the many Schemes that have been drawn, I doubt there are hardly any, which are not imbarra&s;s'd with &s;ome ob&s;tinate difficulty, that the Au|thor would be glad to be fairly rid of.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The &s;everal Notions of Government.</HEAD>
<P>As to the late Civil Wars, 'tis pretty well known, what Notions of Govern|ment went current in tho&s;e Days. When Monarchy was to be &s;ubverted, we know what was nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify the Fact; and then, becau&s;e it was con|venient for their purpo&s;e, it was un|doubtedly true in the Nature of Things, <HI>That Government had its Original from the People, and the Prince was only their Tru&s;tee, to execute the Office they had put into his hand, which they might re&s;ume when they &s;aw fit.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Doctrine that was com|monly receiv'd, and the only Doctrine that reli&s;h'd in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>But afterwards, when Monarchy took its Place again, and a new Scene of things appear'd upon the Stage, another Notion of Government came in Fa&s;hi|on, <HI>Then Government had its Original en|tirely
<PB N="7" REF="014023_0006_0F92AE3BC5CF8C80">from God, and the Prince was ac|countable to none but Him; &s;o that let Him do what he would, He was not to be oppos'd, and what Injury &s;oever we might &s;uffer by Him we mu&s;t wait for a Redre&s;s, till the Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then Princes were</HI> tuti Imperii Maje|&s;tate, <HI>their Maje&s;ty was their Protection, and their Character their Sanctuary, and as they were intru&s;ted by none but God, &s;o there was nothing left for Subjects, but the Glory of obeying.</HI> The&s;e Notions of Government went glibly down, accor|ding to the Times, they were vented in.</P>
<P>And now, upon another turn of things, when People have a liberty to &s;peak out, a new Set of notions is ad|vanced; <HI>now Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience is all a mi&s;take, and in&s;tead of being a duty to &s;uffer oppre&s;&s;ion, 'tis a Glorious Act to re&s;i&s;t it; and in&s;tead of leaving Injuries to be re|dre&s;s'd by God, we have a natural Right to relieve our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Now amid&s;t the&s;e contradictions, which have each been manag'd with art and dexterity, 'tis hard to find
<PB N="8" REF="014023_0007_0F92AE3E84C64E28">where the Truth lies. Each notion has pa&s;s'd for true Sterling in its turn; and if we were to judge by the &s;ame Rule, that &s;uch Principles are too commonly receiv'd by, we mu&s;t then judge accord|ing to our Intere&s;t, and according to the humour of the Times we live in; and tho' we may not happen to be right, yet we &s;hall generally be allow'd to be &s;o, and we are &s;ure to be of the &s;trong|e&s;t Side.</P>
<P>But after all, there is a Right, and a Wrong, however Prejudice, or In|tere&s;t has perplex'd, and entangled them; and as it will be a very fair &s;tep to the di&s;covery of the Right, if we can find what Notions are Wrong, &s;o I will en|deavour to lay down &s;ome Propo&s;itions, as Rules for this purpo&s;e, by which we may form a certain Judgment, and when we have by this means clear'd a|way the Rubbi&s;h, we may the more ea&s;ily find the Jewel, that lies buried in &s;uch a Heap of Confu&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Principles to be granted.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the&s;e Rules I will build upon &s;uch Principles only, as the greate&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="014023_0008_0F92AE4169718710">Part, if not all Mankind are agreed in; And therefore I will take it for gran|ted.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT as the Wi&s;dom of God made the World for &s;ome End, &s;o what|ever that End was, it is the duty of every man to pur&s;ue it to his power.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT whatever Means are in the nature of things nece&s;&s;ary to that End, the &s;ame are &s;o many Laws, and Rules of Action, and &s;o many ne|ce&s;&s;ary and natural duties to be ob&s;erv'd in the pur&s;uit of that End.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT Means, as &s;uch, are only for the &s;ake of the End, and by
<PB N="10" REF="014023_0009_0F92AE41C9423570">con&s;equence as the End mu&s;t be more valuable then the Means, &s;o the value of the Means mu&s;t ri&s;e or fall, and our duty and obligation to make u&s;e of 'em, mu&s;t be greater, or le&s;s, according as they are more, or le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the End; And if &s;o, from hence it will follow,</P>
<P>That when any thing, which is in its own nature a nece&s;&s;ary Means to an End, &s;hall, by being applied in &s;uch and &s;uch a manner, prove de&s;tructive of that End; &s;o far as it is our duty to pur&s;ue the End, &s;o far it is our duty to reject that application.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch Principles as few will di&s;allow; and I believe it will hardly be denied me further,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT the End for which God made the World, was to do Good, or, in other words, that every thing
<PB N="11" REF="014023_0010_0F92AE4231A5DE90">might be Happy according to its Na|ture, and by con&s;equence as Mankind are of a &s;ociable Nature, and cannot be truly Happy without Society, it mu&s;t have been one End of that Wi&s;|dom that made us for our Happine&s;s, that we &s;hould be united in Society, and therefore it mu&s;t be our duty, not only to &s;upport Society, but to do it in &s;uch a Way as is mo&s;t for its Happine&s;s. (See Principle I.) And therefore all notions mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and all actions unlawful, that tend either to the De|&s;truction, or Mi&s;ery of Society.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE V.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> BY the Happine&s;s of Society is to be meant chiefly, the Security of every one's Rights and Properties.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL take it for granted, and I believe mo&s;t men are pretty well agreed,
<PB N="12" REF="014023_0011_0F92AE42F873FEF0">that Government is nece&s;&s;ary to the Happine&s;s of Society; and, by con&s;e|quence, it mu&s;t be an indi&s;pen&s;able Truth, that Government ought to be maintain'd. (Principle II.) And there|fore tho&s;e notions of Government mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and tho&s;e actions unlawful, which tend to the de&s;truction of Govern|ment, that is, which tend to the making of Government precarious, and the intro|ducing di&s;order and confu&s;ion. And if &s;o,</P>
<P>Then, &s;hould we &s;o far a&s;cribe the Power of the Government to the Peo|ple, as to give them a Right to re&s;ume it when they plea&s;e; as this would undoubtedly make Government preca|rious, and tend to Civil di&s;cord and con|fu&s;ion, this notion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be fal&s;e, and &s;uch an action of the People unlawful. But then,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE VII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> AS Government is only a means to an End, and as the End is to be preferr'd before the means, &s;o it mu&s;t by
<PB N="13" REF="014023_0012_0F92AE43C9C47530">con&s;equence be a certain Truth, That in Government the End mu&s;t chiefly be re|garded, and therefore that notion of Government mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and that ac|tion unlawful, which is contrary to the End, and Rea&s;on of Government.</P>
<P>And as all men, I &s;uppo&s;e, will agree in this, that the End of Government is the Happine&s;s of Society; That notion of Government mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and that action unlawful, that is contrary to the Happine&s;s of Society. And if &s;o,</P>
<P>Then, &s;hould Government be &s;o far a&s;crib'd to God, as to give the Prince an ab&s;olute Authority over his People, to di&s;po&s;e of their Rights, as he &s;ees fit, without any Power in the People to op|po&s;e it, as this mu&s;t make the Happi|ne&s;s of Society precarious, and tend to their utter mi&s;ery and ruin, this notion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be fal&s;e. But yet, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE VIII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> SHOULD a Re&s;i&s;tance of Go|vernours be &s;o far allow'd, that upon e|very mere pretence of oppre&s;&s;ion, or in|deed upon every real injury, it may be lawful for &s;ubjects to re&s;i&s;t; as this would
<PB N="14" REF="014023_0013_0F92AE44A719F6C8">not only make <HI>Government</HI> precarious, but would hazard the peace and happi|ne&s;s of Society, this notion mu&s;t by con|&s;equence be fal&s;e, and that Re&s;i&s;tance unlawful. And if &s;o,</P>
<P>Then from hence it will follow, that, as there is a Re&s;i&s;tance lawful, &s;o there is a Non-re&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary both to the &s;afety of Government, and the welfare of Society. And if &s;o,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="principle">
<HEAD>PRINCIPLE IX.</HEAD>
<P>FROM all the&s;e con&s;iderations put to|gether, it will follow, as a certain un|deniable truth, that that notion of go|vernment mu&s;t be the only true one, which &s;ecures the Government from the In&s;ults of Rebellion, and protects the People from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Ty|ranny.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the Principles I de&s;ire to be granted; the&s;e I think are &s;uch, as will hardly be denied; and if &s;o, from the&s;e we may be enabled to form to our&s;elves a certain, and regular Scheme of Govern|ment, &s;uch as I believe, all Men will a|gree in, that are govern'd by right Rea&s;on which is then only &s;aid to be right, when
<PB N="15" REF="014023_0014_0F92AE47D7D00608">it agrees with the Natures, and Rea&s;ons of things.</P>
<P>To make a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay of this kind, is the de&s;ign of this treati&s;e, and to do it the more clearly, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to &s;hew what I mean by Govern|ment; and for this Purpo&s;e, I think it may not be improper to look back, and inquire after its Original, and &s;earch out the Root, from whence it grew.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Original of Government.</HEAD>
<P>AND as to this it is certain, that whe|ther 'twas deriv'd from God, or Men, the Original Rea&s;on, and Occa&s;ion of it was, the Corruption, or Imperfection of human Nature.</P>
<P>For, tho' there would have been &s;ome|thing like Government in a State of Puri|ty and Innocence, (had Mankind continu|ed in that State) as there would have been a difference of Degrees, of Superi|ority and Inferiority, as of Parents, and Childern, and tho' they would probably have had &s;ome Rules of Order, as there are &s;uppo&s;s'd to be among&s;t the Angels of Heaven, yet there would have been nothing like (what we call) Government
<PB N="16" REF="014023_0015_0F92AE482C413170">now in this State of Corruption we are in; that is there would have been nothing like a Government of Coercion.</P>
<P>For 'tis evidently demon&s;trable from Principles of Rea&s;on, That the State of Man's Innocence was a State of Perfecti|on, wherein, as Rea&s;on was given us for our Guide, &s;o all our Powers and Facul|ties, our Rational Will, and Bodily Oper|ations were intirely Subject to its direc|tion, and therefore as there was on need of any other Laws, than what our Rea&s;on would furni&s;h us withal, in things that lay within its reach, &s;o we have no ground to think there would have been any other. But whatever Rea&s;on &s;hould have injoin'd us, either to do, or avoid; whil&s;t we had continued in this Perfection, every one would have ob&s;erv'd of his own voluntary Motion, and no &s;ooner would our Under&s;tandings have approv'd any thing as nece&s;&s;ary, but our Wills would have prompted us to action.</P>
<P>This was undoubtedly the true State of Man's Innocence, and in &s;uch a State as this is, all Government would be ab|&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, and unnece&s;&s;ary, but that in our own bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>For where men are intirely govern'd by
<PB N="17" REF="014023_0016_0F92AE4927E94518">Rea&s;on, there can be no Covetou&s;ne&s;s, nor Ambition; no Envy, nor Ill-nature; no Jealou&s;ies, nor Fears; no Inclo&s;ures, nor Property; no <HI>Meums,</HI> nor <HI>Tuums,</HI> but all things would naturally be common: no man would have any Right to any thing, more than another; nor any man have any Right to more than he &s;hould want: nor any longer than tho&s;e wants &s;hould continue; and every man's wants would be regulated by Rea&s;on; &s;o that as God made enough of every thing for every one's nece&s;&s;ities, &s;o right Rea&s;on would not admit of any contention, be|cau&s;e in the nature of things there could be no Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>And had Man continued in this State, wherein every one was a Law unto him|&s;elf, and had a Court of Chancery in his own brea&s;t, what need could there be of any other Laws, any other Go|vernment, but this?</P>
<P>But now in this our corrupted State, we have a &s;trange backwardne&s;s very of|ten to what our Rea&s;on approves, and as great a pronene&s;s to what it forbids; &s;o that we &s;tand in need of what a State of Innocence would have had no occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>This I lay down as the Original of Go|vernment,
<PB N="18" REF="014023_0017_0F92AE49B6AA08A8">and tho' there is no part of this notion, that I do not think I have a &s;ub&s;tantial Demon&s;tration for, yet I pro|po&s;e it only as a notion, which I &s;hall lay no great &s;tre&s;s upon, and whether true or fal&s;e, it is not very material to my fol|lowing de&s;ign.</P>
<P>However, thus much is certain, and allow'd on all Hands, That whatever a State of Innocence might have oc|ca&s;ion for, Rea&s;on alone, in the State that we are now in, is not a &s;ufficient guide, and &s;ecurity to us: But 'tis evident, we want external motives to excite us to, and encourage us in what is good, and powerful re&s;traints to keep us from what is bad; without which, con&s;idering the Exorbitancy of mens Pa&s;&s;ions, Mankind would in&s;ult and incroach upon one an|other; the &s;tronger would oppre&s;s, and over-run the weaker, and the World would run into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And from hence it was, either by hu|man Contrivance, or divine Appoint|ment, that Mankind became form'd into regular Societies for the &s;ecurity of each other's Rights, and Properties, and devis'd &s;uch Laws of Incouragement to Virtue, and Re&s;traint from Vice, as they
<PB N="19" REF="014023_0018_0F92AE4A8FF839F0">have thought mo&s;t &s;uitable and proper for that End. And,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Definition of Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE due Admini&s;tration, Application, or Execution of the&s;e Laws, which the Society has devi&s;ed for the &s;ecurity of their &s;everal Rights and Properties, I call Government; which definition, as I think it cannot be well di&s;puted, &s;o I &s;hall all along take it for granted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>What is to be meant by the Society.</HEAD>
<P>BUT here it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that when I u&s;e the&s;e Words <HI>(which the Society has devis'd)</HI> I do not mean by this, that all the whole Society, in every member of it, mu&s;t be per&s;onally con&s;enting to the making of every Law, before it be enacted a Law of the Society; this can|not be in the nature of the thing, and therefore the making of Laws mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be intru&s;ted by every &s;ociety in &s;ome particular hands, and as &s;ome me|thods mu&s;t be appointed, and &s;ome rules ob&s;erv'd in the doing of it, &s;o when any Law is decreed by tho&s;e per&s;ons, after that method, and according to tho&s;e rules
<PB N="20" REF="014023_0019_0F92AE4B49ACF978">appointed by the Society, I call that a Law of the Society.</P>
<P>Thus far then, I think, the Ca&s;e is plain, that the Original Rea&s;on of Govern|ment was the Imperfection, or Corrupti|on of human Nature; and if the Security of the Rights, and Properties of the Socie|ty is, as it is certainly, the End of all Government (Principle IV. and V.) from hence it will follow.</P>
<P>That the Determination of Property mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been before the &s;et|tlement of Government; this being only a Means for the &s;ecuring of Property, and by con&s;equence Government could not be founded in any <HI>Primary</HI> Law of Nature, if Property it &s;elf was not.</P>
<P>Now by a Law of Nature, I mean &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of things, obliging me to do &s;uch, or &s;uch an action, from the relation, that action bears to &s;uch, or &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary End.</P>
<P>And when I u&s;e the Word <HI>Primary</HI> Law of Nature, I refer to the Two differ|ent States of Mankind, the fir&s;t before, the other after the Fall: And according to the&s;e two different States, I &s;uppo&s;e there are different Sorts of natural Laws, and different Rights, and Obligations.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="014023_0020_0F92AE4BF798E900">
For whatever is in the nature of things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s either to be done or enjoy'd, Nature, gives us a Law, as to that thing, and not only lays an Obligation on us, but conveys a natural Right to us, either to do, or enjoy it; and as 'tis evident there are a great many more things nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s, &s;ince our nature became corrupted, than before, &s;o by con&s;e|quence there mu&s;t be a great many more natural obligations, and natural Rights in this, than in the former State. And accordingly I di&s;tingui&s;h the Laws and Rights of Nature into <HI>Primary,</HI> and <HI>Se|condary</HI> Laws and Rights; and 'tis in this &s;en&s;e that I &s;ay, Government could not be founded in any <HI>Primary</HI> Law of Na|ture; that is; there could be no natural Nece&s;&s;ity of it in a State of pure Nature, for the &s;ecuring of Property, if there was no &s;uch thing as Property to be &s;ecur'd by it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Definition of Property.</HEAD>
<P>Now by Property I mean, &s;uch a Right to any thing, as to make it my own, exclu&s;ive of all others Right, or Claim to it; And that there could be no &s;uch

<P>For a State of Purity is a State, where all things are govern'd by right Rea&s;on; and as Rea&s;on is then only Right, when it agrees with the natures and rea&s;ons of things, &s;o no man could have any natural Right to any thing any farther, or any longer, than as Rea&s;on &s;hould judge he had a natural want of it; and had Mankind continued in this State of Purity, as all their wants would have been regulated by Rea&s;on, &s;o (it were ea&s;y to prove, if there were occa&s;ion) all things would have continued common, as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>But when this State of Purity was lo&s;t and in&s;tead of all their Operations being govern'd by Rea&s;on, the Fle&s;h being to lu&s;t again&s;t the Spirit, and the Mem|bers to wage war again&s;t the Mind, when mens Lu&s;ts and Appetites grew heady, and extravagant, as their wants would naturally increa&s;e by the increa&s;e of their Lu&s;ts, &s;o from the increa&s;e of their wants, there would ari&s;e a nece&s;&s;ity of larger &s;upplies, and the&s;e larger &s;upplies would naturally beget monopolies and inclo|&s;ures,
<PB N="23" REF="014023_0022_0F92AE4D8772EFC8">and tho&s;e inclo&s;ures would as naturally beget contention, and conten|tion as naturally beget confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now whether out of an obvious &s;en&s;e of this, Mankind might not of them|&s;elves agree upon a certain divi&s;ion of &s;uch portions of lands, as they thought convenient for their families.</P>
<P>Or whether our Fir&s;t Parents, who were the only per&s;ons, who could have any pretence to any Property in any thing, might not make a di&s;tribution to their children, and allot them their re&s;pective portions for the prevention of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Or whether they might not leave their Children at liberty to take what they pleas'd, and give them &s;ome general Rule of Property, <HI>That whatever any one &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, he &s;hould enjoy, as his own,</HI> which we call the Law of Occupancy: And &s;o as families increas'd, they might tran|&s;plant them&s;elves, and whil&s;t they had the range of the World before them, they might take to them&s;elves without Injury to any one, what they &s;hould find their occa&s;ion requir'd.</P>
<P>Whether it might be this, or any other Way, it is not po&s;&s;ible to deter|mine at this di&s;tance, nor is it indeed
<PB N="24" REF="014023_0023_0F92AE4E5229BC08">very material to be inquir'd into, were it not to gratify our curio&s;ity: Which way &s;oever the divi&s;ion came, 'tis cer|tain, that one time, or other their was &s;ome divi&s;ion, or appropriation made, and from this divi&s;ion, there aro&s;e a Property.</P>
<P>And now the great Que&s;tion comes in place, How Mankind happen'd to fall into this method of &s;ecuring their Pro|perties, which we call Government, whe|ther by the Appointment of God, or by the Agreement, and Contrivance of Men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Whether Government be from God, or Man.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the great bu&s;ine&s;s in di&s;pute, and one would wonder how 'tis capable of being a di&s;pute, if men would but ex|amine things not with their prejudices but their Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, 'tis plau&s;ibly alledg'd, that con&s;idering how nece&s;&s;ary Govern|ment is to the welfare of Mankind, it would be an unworthy reflection upon the Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s of God, to have le&s;t the World without &s;uch a pro|vi&s;ion, as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their Happine&s;s; and therefore &s;ome conclude,
<PB N="25" REF="014023_0024_0F92AE4F6874D790">that Government was the Appointment of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, is very plau&s;ibly alledg'd, and if there were any thing in Govern|ment &s;o dark and intricate, as not to be di&s;cover'd by natural Rea&s;on, we may conclude it was made known by Revel|ation.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he who made us to be Hap|py, as is already &s;uppos'd, (Principle IV.) cannot let us want any thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s; and if we cannot come at it in an ordinary, we may conclude, he will &s;upply us in an extraordinary way.</P>
<P>But there can be nothing of this na|ture &s;uppos'd in the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Government; their is nothing that can require any &s;uch extraordinary Revelation concerning it.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="axiom">
<HEAD>AXIOM I.</HEAD>
<P>FOR 'tis &s;elf evident, that Mankind, as being naturally &s;ociable creatures, are naturally capable of entring into Societies of them&s;elves; without an ex|traordinary Revelation; and that there|fore there needs no extraordinary com|mi&s;&s;ion from God to impower them to do, what he has already, by their very nature, directed them to.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IT can be as little doubted, but that there can be no need in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, of any extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion from God, to give men Power to exe|cute tho&s;e Laws they had a natural Power to make; this being nothing more, but a Power to make u&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ary means for the attainment of a nece&s;&s;ary End.</P>
<P>The&s;e are plain Truths, not capable of di&s;pute, and from the&s;e we &s;hall ea&s;ily re&s;olve this point. For, if Mankind needed no extraordinary Revelation to teach them to enter into Societies; and if they needed no Revelation to teach them to make &s;uch Laws, as might be
<PB N="27" REF="014023_0026_0F92AE508AC84100">nece&s;&s;ary for their Happine&s;s, and if they needed no Revelation to give them Power to apply tho&s;e Laws to that End, according as the circum&s;tances of &s;uch Societies &s;hould require, in which the whole notion of Government is ab&s;olved; then 'tis beyond contradiction plain; That there is no Rea&s;on to a&s;cribe the Original of Government to God, &s;o far as relates to the outward formation of Societies, and the making, and execu|ting Laws.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, as they are within the reach of Rea&s;on, &s;o they are ordinarily left to the determination of Rea&s;on, and there was probably never any Govern|ment in the world, excepting that of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that can in this re&s;pect be &s;aid to be <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></P>
</DIV3>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Authority of Government only from God.</HEAD>
<P>BUT yet it does neverthele&s;s appear, and that too from this very argument I have urg'd, That the &s;ole foundation of this Power of making and executing Laws, and the rea&s;on of our obligation to &s;ubmit to them, is deriv'd intirely from the authority of God.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="014023_0027_0F92AE51437BD498">
For we &s;ee the very rea&s;on of forming Societies in the way of Government, is founded in the Happine&s;s of Mankind as the End which God at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd, and the only rea&s;on of their Right to exerci&s;e any Power in tho&s;e Societies is, its being a nece&s;&s;ary means to that End.</P>
<P>And therefore 'tis God's having made Mankind for Happine&s;s, and Govern|ment's being nece&s;&s;ary to that Happine&s;s, which is the true, and only foundation of the authority of Government.</P>
<P>So that 'tis a certain, and indi&s;putable truth in the nature of things, that it is by God alone, that <HI>Kings reign, and Prinies decree Ju&s;tice,</HI> that Government in general is of Divine Authority.</P>
<P>And indeed, as this is the only true foundation, &s;o it is the only &s;ure &s;upport of it. For without this, I cannot &s;ee, how we can give any account of Government at all.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Authority of Government not from the People.</HEAD>
<P>FOR if the Authority of Government ari&s;es meerly from an agreement of a People with one another, it will follow from thence, That no Governor can lawfully exerci&s;e any other Power over
<PB N="29" REF="014023_0028_0F92AE51EFA83DB8">any one, than every one has a Power to a|gree to; and by con&s;equence no Go|vement can have Power to take away Life, becau&s;e no man has an ab&s;olute Power to di&s;po&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But if we a&s;cribe the Authority of Go|vernment to God, and con&s;ider it in the view that we have &s;et it, as a nece&s;&s;ary means in the nature of things for the At|tainment of a nece&s;&s;ary End appointed by God, we have then a Right given us by God to u&s;e it, as a means in order to that End, and therefore &s;o far as the ta|king away the life of a man is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of any Society, That So|ciety has a Right to take it away, even by God's own appointment.</P>
<P>Nay, the argument holds good even in a Private ca&s;e, and the &s;ame rea&s;on will ju&s;tify every man to do the &s;ame thing in his own defence; and as 'tis univer&s;ally allow'd to do &s;o, &s;o 'tis the only rea&s;on, that will do it; but 'tis much &s;tronger, when offer'd in behalf of a Society, as much as the whole is better than a part.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Government were founded only upon the agreement of a People one with another, as every one has a Soul
<PB N="30" REF="014023_0029_0F92AE52D2E79980">and Rea&s;on of his own, and not only a natural Right to judge and chu&s;e for him|&s;elf, but al&s;o to act according to his own, and not another's Judgment, any farther than it becomes his own; &s;o I mu&s;t freely own, upon this Principle, I do not at pre&s;ent &s;ee, how any man can be in duty oblig'd to &s;ubmit to any other Goven|ment, than what he him&s;elf approves, and agrees to; which, as it is a notion that would make Government precarious and tends to di&s;order and confu&s;ion, we have already &s;hewn it mu&s;t mece&s;&s;arily be fal&s;e (Principle VI.)</P>
<P>But if Government be found upon the natural appointment of God, as being in the nature of things a nece&s;&s;ary means to our Happine&s;s, it then becomes every one's duty to &s;upport it, and by con&s;e|quence to &s;ubmit to the Laws of it, tho' perhaps he may not approve of them; and has not per&s;onally agreed to them; and if the Laws be &s;uch, that he cannot in con&s;cience comply with what they com|mand, he mu&s;t patiently bear the pen|alties they inflict. And this is the mean|ing of that Expre&s;&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has given &s;uch occa&s;ion for di&s;pute; That we are to be

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Authority of Government from God, but the Form from Man.</HEAD>
<P>So that to &s;um up all in one word, we &s;ee the foundation upon which the Authority of Government is built, is, the Authority of God, who having made us for Happine&s;s, has thereby given us a Right to Government, as it is a nece&s;&s;ary means to that Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And therefore upon this Principle, man|kind being by nature &s;ociable Creatures, have naturally run into Societies of them&s;elves, and have linkt them&s;elves into common bodies, and devis'd &s;uch Laws for the Happine&s;s of the whole, as
<PB N="32" REF="014023_0031_0F92AE545BFCA088">their &s;everal circum&s;tances have required.</P>
<P>And as the different circum&s;tances of People have created different Intere&s;ts, &s;o the&s;e different Intere&s;ts have created dif|ferent Societies and Governments, where|in they have not only different Laws, but different forms of Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;ome Societies are Go|vern'd by a Monarchy, others by an Ari&s;tocracy, others by a Democracy; and of the&s;e &s;ome are ab&s;olute, others mixt, &s;ome are dependent, others independent.</P>
<P>So that in &s;hort, as the welfare of So|ciety is the End and Rea&s;on of all Govern|ment, &s;o the different Intere&s;ts of dif|ferent Societies is the rea&s;on of the dif|ferent Forms of it: And as it cannot be doubted, but that the&s;e different Forms were devis'd by men, &s;o tho' the Authority of Government be from God, yet the appointment of the Per&s;ons to execute that Authority is purely, and in|tirely the Ordinance of Man. And this gives an account of that Expre&s;&s;ion, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13. <HI>of being Subject to every Ordi|nance of Man for the Lord's Sake,</HI> by which is meant, that tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the Government of Societies in any kind of Form, are only the Ordinance of

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD><HI>COROLLARY I.</HI> The Rea&s;on of Power, in Princes, and Obedience in Subjects.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> FROM hence we may certainly di&s;cover the true Nature of all Political Power, and the true Rea&s;on of our Obe|dience and Submi&s;&s;ion to it.</P>
<P>For if it be true, as we have &s;uppos'd (Principle IV.) that God made Man|kind for Happine&s;s, and that they &s;hould live together in Society: and if it be like|wi&s;e true, as we have thence inferr'd
<PB N="34" REF="014023_0033_0F92AE55D2CF8958">(page 26.) that God thereby authori&s;es every Society to put them&s;elves under &s;uch Forms, and to make and execute &s;uch Laws and Rules, as they find nece&s;&s;ary for their Happine&s;s; it will hence follow, by an obvious con&s;equence, That tho' it be left to to the Society to judge what is nece&s;&s;ary, yet the Power of mak|ing that into a Law, and obliging others to &s;ubmit to it, is intirely deriv'd from God.</P>
<P>And as this Power mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be intru&s;ted by every Society in &s;ome parti|cular hands, and ought to be executed according to &s;ome certain Rules &s;o what &s;o ever tho&s;e Per&s;on, &s;o intru&s;ted, &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary to be done, the Society ought to be determin'd by; and whatever Laws they &s;hall make according to tho&s;e Rules are by con&s;equence to be e&s;teem'd the will and command of God; unle&s;s he has in time pa&s;t, and till he &s;hall in time to come, &s;ignify his will, that it &s;hall be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And as the Admini&s;tration of the&s;e Laws mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be intru&s;ted in one, or more hands, whom we call Governors; &s;o whatever the&s;e Governors &s;hall do according to tho&s;e Laws, is &s;o far done by the Authority of God.</P>

<P>And &s;ince we have already &s;hewn in the foregoing Corollary, That the Laws of a Society are to be obey'd, as the Laws of God, &s;o far as they are agreeable to his Will; it will Follow, That every member of a Society ought to comply with that Form of Wor&s;hip, and &s;ubmit to tho&s;e Rules of Order e&s;tabli&s;h'd among&s;t them, &s;o far as they are not contrary to God's Will.</P>

<P>And &s;o likewi&s;e, as it is apparently the Right of every rational creature grant|ed by God Him&s;elf, nay, as it is a du|ty requir'd of every rational creature, that he govern him&s;elf by Rea&s;on, and by con&s;equence that every one &s;hould judge, and choo&s;e for him&s;elf, &s;o it is unlawful for any Society to impo&s;e any Rules of Wor&s;hip, or Relgious Order upon their members, which they in their judgement cannot lawfully comply with: Becau&s;e this is not only to deprive them of their natural Right of judging for them&s;elves, but al&s;o to require what they cannot do, without a breach of their duty to God.</P>
<P>And therefore whatever Power So|cieties have to put them&s;elves under Re|ligious regulations, yet it can be only under this limitation, that they leave it in the power of every member of it, to comply, or not comply with them, ac|cording as they conceive them to be lawful, or unlawful, that is, that there be a Liberty of Con&s;ciecne.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s where the Religi|ous
<PB N="42" REF="014023_0041_0F92AADA01B82F80">regulations impos'd are allow'd to be lawful, and no Scruple of Con&s;cience is rais'd again&s;t them, there the Society have a Power to command, and the People are under an Obligation to obey, according to the Laws of Nature.</P>
<P>But here you'll &s;ay, If every Society has a Power to appoint what Modes of Wor&s;hip and what Rules of Order; they thinknece&s;&s;ary, they mu&s;t by con&s;equence have a Power to appoint what per&s;ons &s;hall perform Religious Offices, which &s;ome think of dangerous con&s;equence to a&s;&s;ert.</P>

<HEAD>The Magi&s;trates Power over the Prie&s;thood.</HEAD>
<P>BUT be it how it will, it is certainly true in a State, where we &s;uppo&s;e no other Revelation of God's Will concern|ing the&s;e matters, but the natures of things to guide the Rea&s;ons and Opera|tions of Mankind.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a State, I &s;ay, 'tis certainly true: For if Religious Offices mu&s;t be per|form'd, the per&s;ons mu&s;t be appointed either by God, or Man; if by God, &s;ince we &s;uppo&s;e no other Revelation, but the nature of things, there mu&s;t then be &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion granted by God in the nature of things to &s;ome
<PB N="43" REF="014023_0042_0F92AD8FAD0E8008">perticular per&s;ons, by which God mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to have given them an Authority to execute tho&s;e Offices be|fore, and above all other People: But this, I &s;uppo&s;e, is what no man will pre|tend to, and therefore all tho&s;e things mu&s;t be determin'd by Men according to the rules of the Society, who are left the only Judges of what is convenient, where God has not yet reveal'd his Will; and tho&s;e per&s;ons who are thus dedicat|ed to God's &s;ervice according to the Rules of every &s;uch Society, are as much the Mini&s;ters of God, as if they had been &s;ent by an extraordinary Commi&s;|&s;ion from God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But where God has thought fit to reveal his Will, there the Society are no longer Judges of the&s;e things: their own Rea&s;on is no longer their Guide, but God's Revelation; and tho' before they had a Power to do, and injoin, what they thought fit, here they are to act as God injoins, and their Power is de termin'd by the Rule of the Revelation.</P>
<P>But then, as this Revelation is their Rule, &s;o they are not to be determin'd by it any farther, than it reveals; and by con&s;equence where the Revelation is &s;ilent, there is no reveal'd Rule, and there|fore
<PB N="44" REF="014023_0043_0F92AD9062708B28">there mu&s;t be the &s;ame Power re|maining in the Society, which they had before that Revelation was given.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' every Society has a natural Power to appoint the Per&s;ons, and pre&s;cribe the Qualifications for Religious Offices, where God has left them only to their own Rea&s;ons, yet if God has by any Revelation appointed tho&s;e Offices to &s;ome perticular Per&s;ons and has given them the appointment of others under &s;ome certain Regulations, there of the Power the Society is limi|ted and they have no more Power to act contrary to this, than they have Power to act contrary to God's Will.</P>
<P>And indeed, as no Society lawfully act any thing, but what they think is for the welfare of the Society, &s;o they can have no rea&s;on to act contrary to &s;uch a re|vealed appointment, unle&s;s they could &s;uppo&s;e, that God did not know what was be&s;t to be done in every Society, or would pre&s;cribe any thing, that is not for the welfare of the Society.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion therefore in this ca&s;e is what Revelation God has made con|cerning it, either directly, or indirectly whether he has expre&s;ly appointed any perticular men to execute Religious
<PB N="45" REF="014023_0044_0F92AD917A9471D8">Offices before him, or whether he has given any commi&s;&s;ion to them to appoint others, and how far that commi&s;&s;ion reaches. For &s;o far as there is &s;uch a Re|velation, &s;o far all Authority is bound|ed, and the Power of the Society can reach no farther, than to regulate the excuti|on of the&s;e Offices, and to appoint &s;uch things both as to the Per&s;ons, and their Offices, as God has not determin'd by that Revelation.</P>
<P>And as this ought to be done by the Society, &s;o it ought to be done in &s;uch a manner, as they &s;hall think be&s;t for the &s;upport of Unity and Order, and the &s;ecurity of the Rights and properties of the Society.</P>

<P>And if &s;o, from hence we are taught a certain Rule, by which all Laws ought to be made, and a certain mea&s;ure, ac|cording to which all Governors ought to be obey'd.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Rule of Con&s;cience in making Laws.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> IF the welfare of the Society be the End, and therefore the Rule of mak|ing Laws, it ought by con&s;equence to be the End, and the only End of every per&s;on intru&s;ted in that concern: And tho' the per&s;ons &s;o intru&s;ted, are the ab&s;olute Judges of what is for the Wel|fare of the Society, and therefore may make what Laws they plea&s;e, yet it is certainly an Abu&s;e of their Power, for which they are highly an&s;werable to God, &s;hould they oppo&s;e any thing that they think is, or agree to any thing they think is not, for the Welfare of the So|ciety they are acting for.</P>
<P>And if as we have already &s;uppos'd, (Principle 5.) The Welfare of Society con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecurity of its Rights and Properties, then as the whole is made
<PB N="47" REF="014023_0046_0F92AD929F84D130">up of parts, &s;o each Per&s;on, as a member, and part of the whole, has a claim to be &s;ecur'd in his Rights and properties.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How far our Rights are to be maintain'd.</HEAD>
<P>BUT then, as the whole is more valu|able than any part, &s;o the &s;ecurity of every particular per&s;on ought to be con&s;ulted, and provided for, only &s;o far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with the welfare of the whole.</P>
<P>And if &s;o, no Maxims of Policy can be ju&s;t, nor any Laws be Lawful, that de|prive any one of his Right, or intrench on his Property, any farther than as the welfare of the whole requires it.</P>
<P>And as the Laws, that are made for the &s;ecurity of our Rights, are in their nature to be &s;uppos'd for the Welfare of the whole, &s;o long as they are allow'd to continue in Force: &s;o no man can be Lawfully depriv'd of his Rights under any pretence of the Public Good, any farther than the&s;e Laws allow.</P>
<P>And by con&s;equence, &s;hould any per|&s;on, or authority what&s;oever di&s;po&s;e of the Rights of any member of the Society for any other rea&s;on, or in any other manner, then the Laws of the Society direct, they would not only do an in|jury

</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Power of every Society to alienate Rights.</HEAD>
<P>BUT then, as the Society has a Pow|er to make, &s;o by con&s;equence for the very &s;ame rea&s;on, they mu&s;t have a Power to alter Laws, and therefore a Power to alter, or alienate our Rights.</P>
<P>But yet, as the &s;ecurity of every man's Right and Property ought to be provid|ed for, in making Laws, as has been ju&s;t now prov'd, &s;o far as con&s;i&s;ts with the welfare of the whole; &s;o it will not be Lawful, even for them, to alter any Law on purpo&s;e to alienate any particu|lar Right, any farther, than as they are convinced, the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of the Society requires it.</P>
<P>For 'tis certain from the very nature of Government, that every member of a So|ciety has a Right to be protected in e|very thing he enjoys by the Rules of the Society.</P>
<P>But yet it is as certain, That no man can have a Right to injure the Society, as it is certain, that the whole is better than a Part.</P>
<P>And therefore, As the End of mak|ing
<PB N="49" REF="014023_0048_0F92AD9574563180">Laws is the &s;ecurity of the Rights of of the Society, &s;o whatever Rights tho&s;e Laws give any private per&s;on, or per|&s;ons, they are naturally &s;uppos'd to be granted only &s;o far, as they are con&s;i&s;t|ing with the &s;ecurity of the Public.</P>
<P>And therefore whenever who&s;e per|&s;ons, who are intru&s;ted by the Society, &s;hall judge any Rights, the Laws have given us, incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of the whole Society, they very law|fully may, and 'tis very expedient they &s;hould, alter tho&s;e Laws, and alienate tho&s;e Rights, which they never could intend by tho&s;e Laws to give.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' in making and repealing Laws, it be nece&s;&s;ary to en|quire into the Rights of the particular per&s;ons concerned, and how far they &s;hall intrench upon tho&s;e Rights in their proceedings, yet where the Pub|lic &s;ecurity requires any thing as nece&s;|&s;ary to be done, there a Private Injury ought to be no Bar again&s;t that, which appears to nece&s;&s;ary to the Public Good.</P>
<P>But then, As that cannot be a ne|ce&s;&s;ary means to an End, where the End can be attained without tho&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="014023_0049_0F92AD95AFC30530">means, &s;o that cannot be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of the Pub|lic, without which the Welfare of the Public may be maintained.</P>
<P>And therefore we ought not to de|prive any one of his Rights, without a due &s;atisfaction to him, under any pretence of the Public Good, where the Public Good can be &s;ecured ano|ther Way.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this a little, let us re|collect a known Ca&s;e. In a late Reign there was a Bill in Parliament for the Exclu&s;ion of the then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> from his Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown. The Laws of the Land had given him a Right, and the King, and Parliament had a Right in them&s;elves, to alienate that Right, if they &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the Rights and Properties of the Soci|ety.</P>
<P>Now, tho' Birthright was a Popu|lar Cry at that Time, yet that was a weak Objection to the Thing, if the Welfare of the whole required it to be done.</P>
<P>And therefore the proper Que&s;tion in that, and all &s;uch like ca&s;es ought to be, how far 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to the
<PB N="51" REF="014023_0050_0F92AD9681F94790">Public Good, that is, how far the Rights and Properties of the Society can be &s;ecured without this, or that pro|ceeding.</P>
<P>And upon a &s;trict enquiry into this, had they who are the only Judges of this matter, I mean the King and Par|liament, agreed in their Opinion, and pa&s;t the Bill, He would immediately have lo&s;t his Right, and &s;hould he af|terwards have laid any claim to the Succe&s;&s;ion, he would have been guilty of High Trea&s;on, and &s;hould any one have protended to a&s;&s;ert his Right, he would have been guilty Rebellion.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the King, and Parlia|ment have pa&s;&s;ed the Bill upon any o|ther con&s;ideration, than as they con|&s;cientiou&s;ly thought it indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of the Socie|ty in the their Rights and Properties; &s;hould the Parliament have mov'd it out of prejudice to the man, or the King have con&s;ented to it for the madne&s;s of the people; or &s;hould either have done it out of any ether motive, than as they were thro'ly &s;atisfied, 'twas &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be done, that the Rights of the So|ciety could not be &s;ecur'd any other way
<PB N="52" REF="014023_0051_0F92AD978DD682D0">they would have been guilty of great Inju&s;tice, and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But we had been concluded neverthe|le&s;s. For we are not Judges of their actions, much le&s;s their Intentions; But they are the Judges, and the only Judges of the Public Good, and there|fore we are to &s;ubmit to their determina|tions, unle&s;s we will make all our Laws u&s;ele&s;s, our Con&s;titution and Govern|ment precarious; which whatever noti|on tends to, we have already &s;hewn to be Fal&s;e (<HI>Principle</HI> VI.)</P>
<P>And thus directed to a certain Rule to guide our con&s;ciences in making Laws, which is the welfare of the So|ciety in the &s;ecurity of their &s;everal Rights, and Properties. And as no Laws ought to be made, but with an Eye to this End, &s;o from hence it will follow.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Nece&s;&s;ity of putting Laws in execution.</HEAD>
<P>THAT whatever Laws are made, ought therefore to be put in execution, &s;o as to attain the End they were made for.</P>
<P>'Twas a reproach the <HI>Romans</HI> ca&s;t upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that they &s;hew'd their wi&s;dom in making good Laws,
<PB N="53" REF="014023_0052_0F92AD99A5499FB0">but their folly in neglecting to ob&s;erve and execute them.</P>
<P>And 'twas a Ju&s;t Reproach, no doubt. For 'twere every whit, as well to have no Laws at all as not have them execut|ed, and ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>But then, As it is nece&s;&s;ary, that Laws once made, &s;hould be carefully execut|ed, &s;o they ought to be executed only for the End, for which they were made; and by con&s;equence not in any other Sen&s;e, than they are &s;uppos'd to be made in, nor for any other End, than the welfare of the Society in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and properties.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;hould any per&s;on pro|&s;ecute, or any officer execute any Law upon any member of the Society, who has offended again&s;t it, and is therefore ju&s;tly liable to it, out of prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, malice, or revange, or any other principle, but the Welfare of Society, tho' they really do nothing, but what the Law requires, and do actually pro|mote the Intere&s;t of the Society, yet they are highly blameable for what they do; And tho' they are not blameable in re|&s;pect of the Society they belong to, yet they are blameable in the &s;ight of God,
<PB N="54" REF="014023_0053_0F92AD9A2BEEA0B8">who has made, not our own humour, and and private re&s;entments, or any other thing, but the Welfare of the Society, the End of every thing that is to be done in the way of Government, whe|her in making or executing Laws.</P>
<P>But &s;hould any per&s;on endeavour to pervert the natural meaning of the Law by any art, or dexterity, he is ma&s;ter of, or any authority, he is inve&s;ted with, and &s;o get it executed in any other &s;en&s;e, than he thinks was intended by it, he would be highly blameable upon that account, not only in re&s;pect of God, but the Society.</P>
<P>Nay, tho' he &s;hould do it upon this Principle only, that he thinks it for the Welfare of the Society, that the Law &s;hould be taken in the &s;en&s;e he gives it, yet if he is &s;en&s;ible it is not the true &s;en&s;e, that is, the &s;en&s;e that was intend|ed by the makers of the Law, 'tis cer|tainly an offence again&s;t God, and the So|ciety. Becau&s;e God has oblig'd us to &s;ub|mit to the Rules of the Society, and the Society having appointed &s;uch, and &s;uch per&s;ons, the only Judges of their wel|fare and what Laws are nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, who are by con&s;equence requir'd by God, and the Society, not
<PB N="55" REF="014023_0054_0F92AD9AF558EFC8">only to &s;ubmit to the Laws they make but al&s;o to the &s;en&s;e they make them in, &s;o far as it is a lawful &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>And therefore, &s;o far as we &s;hall en|deavour to impo&s;e any private &s;en&s;e up|on the Law, contrary to what we think was intended by it, &s;o far we endeavour to pervert the Rules, and Orders of the Society, by making the Welfare of the whole to depend upon our private Judg|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If the end of making, and and executing Laws be the Welfare of the Society, in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and Properties, from hence we have a Rule for the regulation of the Laws, and the manner of the execution of 'em in every wi&s;e and Good Govern|ment.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How Laws are to be regulated and executed.</HEAD>
<P>FOR If this be the End of all Laws, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary to every wi&s;e, and Good Government, that their be Good Laws made, but that they be manag'd &s;o, as &s;hall be thought be&s;t to an&s;wer the End of their making, and by con&s;equence &s;uch as &s;hall be mo&s;t likely to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>

<HEAD>Laws to be Few and Plain.</HEAD>
<P>A Multitude of Laws Politicians have always look'd upon, and Societies have always found, a burthen, and 'twas a complaint of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> that whereas <HI>Rome</HI> had formerly abounded with horrid, and dete&s;table vices, &s;o in his time, it was as much pe&s;ter'd with a multitude of mi&s;chivious and unnece&s;&s;ary Laws, which prov'd a remedy as bad as the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>AGAIN, If the Laws of a Society ought to be made &s;o, as that they may mo&s;t probably be ob&s;erv'd, then as they ought to be as few, and as plain, &s;o they ought to be as gentle, and ea&s;y, as po&s;&s;ible. And therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary care of every Society, not to make any &s;uch Laws, as they know, or may rea&s;on|ably think before hand, a great part of the Society, will not &s;ubmit to, unle&s;s the Welfare of the Society &s;o far re|quires it, as that it cannot be &s;ecur'd any other way.</P>
<P>Let the Principle upon which they will oppo&s;e the Law, be what it will, whether weakne&s;s, or perver&s;ene&s;s, 'tis all one, for &s;ince it will not be ob&s;erv'd, it &s;hould not be injoin'd; Becau&s;e &s;uch oppo&s;ition may beget confu&s;ion, which as it may hazard the peace and Welfare

<P>And as the Rea&s;on of making, and continuing Laws is the &s;ame, &s;o from hence it will follow.</P>
<P>That, if they ought not to make Laws, which they know before-hand will be oppos'd, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on it does not &s;eem Proper to continue &s;uch Laws, as they afterwards find, are &s;o oppo&s;ed;</P>
<P>And therefore as all Laws ought to be &s;o made, &s;o they ought for the &s;ame rea&s;on to be &s;o alter'd, as far as po&s;&s;ible, that they may be ob&s;erv'd All. But &s;till this is to be under&s;tood, &s;o far only as con&s;i&s;ts with the Welfare of Society.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Nothing Burthen&s;ome to be Impos'd without Nece&s;&s;ity.</HEAD>
<P>AGAIN, If all Laws ought to be as gentle and ea&s;y, as po&s;&s;ible, then it &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary care of every So|ciety, that no more burthens be impo&s;|ed upon 'tis members, than are ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Welfare of the Whole.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="014023_0058_0F92AD9DE1A4CEE8">
And as every member of the Society is a &s;harer in the Welfare of the Whole; &s;o all &s;uch Impo&s;itions, ought to be &s;o order'd, as that every one &s;hall bear a &s;hare in the burthen.</P>

<P>For tho' a Law be never &s;o wi&s;ely con|triv'd for the &s;ecurity of Right and pro|perty, yet if in obtaining the benefit of that Law, I mu&s;t &s;pend more time, and be at more charge, than my Right, and property is worth, 'tis the &s;ame thing to me, as if there were really no &s;uch Law.</P>
<P><HI>Short Inju&s;tice,</HI> the Per&s;ian Proverb &s;ays, <HI>is better than long Ju&s;tice</HI></P>
<P>And therefore it &s;eems to be a nece&s;|&s;ary care of every good Government, that in the manner of executing the Laws of
<PB N="61" REF="014023_0060_0F92AD9F57F29998">of the Society, no &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary de|lays be allow'd, as &s;hall fru&s;trate the ju&s;t proceedings of the Law, nor any &s;uch burthen&s;ome charges be requir'd, as &s;hall defeat the benefit, and intenti|on of it.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what improvements may be made of this Principle: It might be carried a great way farther, if there were occa&s;ion, but this is &s;ufficient for a general hint; it furni&s;hes us, you &s;ee, with an in fallible Rule for the Mak|ing and Executing Laws: And from the &s;ame Principle we have.</P>

<HEAD>The Mea&s;ure of Submi&s;&s;ion to Governors.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A like certain Rule, by which to mea&s;ure our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Gover|nors, who, according to our definition of Government, are the Admini&s;tra|tors of the Laws.</P>
<P>This has been the &s;ubject of great di&s;putes, and, as it has been manag'd, it has been made a matter of very great difficulty; whereas, according to the&s;e Principles, which I have here laid down, there is nothing capable of a more ea&s;y and certain re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="014023_0061_0F92ADA0EC929948">
For if the Welfare of Society be, as we have &s;hewn (Principle IV. VII.) the End of every thing, that is done in the way of Government, it mu&s;t by con&s;equence be the End of all Authori|ty and Obedience.</P>
<P>And tho' the Authority of Govern|ment be from God, as we have &s;hewn (page 27, 28, 29, 30.) and tho' Obedi|ence be therefore due to Governors out of duty to God, from whom their Au|thority is derived, yet God cannot be &s;uppos'd to command any &s;uch O|bedience to any Governor, nor can any per&s;on pretend to exact Obedience from any people, any farther, than He is their Governor.</P>
<P>And therefore when any &s;uch Go|vernor &s;hall cea&s;e to govern them, his Right to their Obedience mu&s;t cea&s;e too.</P>
<P>And &s;ince according to our forementi|on'd definition (page 20) Government is the Admi&s;tration of &s;uch Laws, as the Society has devis'd for the &s;ecuri|ty of their Rights and Properties, it will follow,</P>
<P>That a Man mu&s;t then cea&s;e to Go|vern his People, when he either cea&s;es
<PB N="63" REF="014023_0062_0F92ADA1949EF9F8">intirely to act, by Death, or Re&s;igna|tion, by Abdication or Conque&s;t, or when he cea&s;es to act for the &s;ecurity of the Rights and Properties of the So|ciety he is &s;et over, That is,</P>
<P>When he either actually invades the Rights and Properties of the Society, or lays a&s;ide tho&s;e Laws that are made for their Security.</P>
<P>When therefore any Governor does this, as He thereby cea&s;es to Govern that People, &s;o that People are di&s;char|ged from their Obedience to Him, as their Governor, and the rea&s;on of their Allegiance being ceas'd, their duty and obligation mu&s;t likewi&s;e cea&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary and un|avoidable con&s;equence, and this I take to be the foundation of all Oaths to Conquerors, <HI>viz.</HI> That their late Go|vernor cea&s;es to Govern them.</P>
<P>And certainly, if cea&s;ing to be a Go|vernor in the Ca&s;e of Conque&s;t, will ju&s;tify the alienation of our Allegiance, where he cea&s;es to Govern, not by any act of his own, not by voluntarily re|fu&s;ing to govern, nor by neglecting the Rights and Welfare of his People, but is depriv'd of his Government by rapine,
<PB N="64" REF="014023_0063_0F92ADA797EB4698">and violence, perhaps contrary to the inclination, and true intere&s;t of the People; I &s;ay, if this will ju&s;tify, as all allow, the argument is much &s;tronger in the ca&s;e &s;uppos'd, where a Prince &s;hall voluntarily invade, or de&s;ignedly over|turn the Rights of the Society.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s any one will be &s;o extravagant|ly ab&s;urd, as to call that Government, which is contrary to the very notion of Government, where in&s;tead of ad|mini&s;tring, and executing Laws, he acts directly contrary to 'em, and in&s;tead of protecting and maintaining the Rights of his People, he becomes an oppre&s;&s;or and de&s;troyer of them, both which are as directly oppo&s;ite to Government, as Light is to darkne&s;s, or Health to Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>But that we may make this &s;till clear|er, let us &s;tate the argument another Way;</P>
<P>We have already prov'd, That every Governor acts by the Authority of God; and therefore has a divine Right to his &s;ubjects Obedience (page. 30.) yet as that Right is founded upon that Commi&s;&s;ion He can by con&s;equence have no Right to Obedience, farther than
<PB N="65" REF="014023_0064_0F92ADAB82421060">his Commi&s;&s;ion reaches, and therefore where he has no authority to command, the People can be under no Obligation to obey: And if &s;o, Then &s;ince the Welfare of Society is the End of all Go|vernment, and &s;ince the Authorty, of Government, and the Obedience of Subjects is founded only on this bottom as they are nece&s;&s;ary to that End, (ib. pag 23) The Welfare of Society mu&s;t by con&s;equence be the Bounds both of the Subjects Duty, and the Govern|ment's Authority, and therefore God cannot be &s;uppos'd to allow any Go|vernment to command, nor enquire any People to obey, any farther than it is for the Welfare Society.</P>
<P>And as the Welfare of the Society con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and properties, and as the Laws that are made for their &s;ecurity, are &s;uppos'd to be for their Welfare, &s;o long as they are in Force, &s;o when any Governor &s;hall invade the rights of his &s;ubjects or lay a&s;ide tho&s;e Laws, which are made for their &s;ecurity, as he acts con|trary to the Welfare of the Society, &s;o he acts without Authority, and Commi&s;|&s;ion from God, and therefore can have no Right to be obey'd.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="014023_0065_0F92ADB0E53F2030">
In a word, As every Governor has his Commi&s;&s;ion from God, for the Welfare of his People, &s;o that which gives him a title to their Obedience, gives them a title to his Protection.</P>
<P>And as He who invades the Rights of the Prince or Governor, mu&s;t there|by forfeit all claim to his Protection, &s;o He who invades, or de&s;troys the Rights of his people, by the &s;ame rea|&s;on, forfeits his claim to their Obedi|ence.</P>
<P>The Rights of both are founded on the &s;ame bottom; The Welfare of the Society is the end and rea&s;on, and rule of both: 'Tis the very rea&s;on of the Au|thority of Government, as it is deriv'd from God, and 'tis the rea&s;on of this or that Family's being appointed to exe|cute that Authority by the Society.</P>
<P>And therefore when Governors act contrary to the Welfare, that is, contra|ry to the Laws of the Society, they act contrary to the rea&s;on of Government and Obedience; and that they &s;hou'd be obey'd in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is contrary to the Intention of God and Man.</P>
<P>And as no Governor, who is but the Ad|mini&s;trator of the Law, can have a Right to puni&s;h his Subjects for not doing
<PB N="67" REF="014023_0066_0F92ADB173874CA8">what by Law it was not their duty to do, much le&s;s for not doing, what by Law it was their duty not to do, &s;o on the other hand, no Subject can be under any Obligation to &s;ubmit to that pu|ni&s;hment, when the Governor had not a Legal Right to inflect.</P>
<P>This Argument contains the &s;en&s;e and Sub&s;tance of what is, or I think, ought to be meant, by that which is &s;o often talk'd of in this di&s;pute, viz. <HI>a Prince's breaking the Original Contract,</HI> that is, his acting contrary to the Original Rea|&s;on of Government.</P>
<P>For as the End and Rea&s;on for which all Rulers were originally intru&s;ted with their power and privileges by their re&s;pective Societies, and for which &s;uch Societies put them&s;elves under their &s;e|veral re&s;pective Forms of Government, was the &s;ecurity of their Rights and Properties; &s;o who&s;oever fir&s;t took that Tru&s;t upon him, took it for this End, and upon this Condition; and by con|&s;equence there is a Tacit Contract &s;up|pos'd in the very nature of the Tru&s;t it|&s;elf, That upon his di&s;charging his duty to them, they will be under &s;uch obligations to him, becau&s;e 'tis given by
<PB N="68" REF="014023_0067_0F92ADB2448D7760">the people, and taken by the Prince for this very End and Rea&s;on. And as this End is the foundation of all Government; &s;o where-ever any Government is, this Tacit Contract is nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppos'd to go along with it, as being founded in the very nature of the thing; And as this Tacit contract is the Bond of Union be|tween the Governor and the People, &s;o when this contract is broke; the Bond of Union is broke; and by con&s;equence the Society is as much di&s;charg'd from the obligations of that Union, as if that contract had never been made.</P>
<P>And as a Prince mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;aid to break his contract, and by con&s;e|quence di&s;olve his Union with his Peo|ple, when he wilfully and di&s;ignedly acts contrary to the end and rea&s;on of his Tru&s;t; &s;o his People are by con|&s;equence di&s;carged from their obligati|ons to him, and may lawfully defend them&s;elves again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e 'tis un|doubtedly certain, That Governors may be lawfully oppos'd, and re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Thus far mu&s;t be true in general.</P>

<PB N="69" REF="014023_0068_0F92ADB303C627F0">
<P>But the Que&s;tion is, what kind of Re&s;i&s;tance, this mu&s;t be; for &s;ome &s;ort of Oppo&s;ition and Re&s;i&s;tance, all men allow.</P>
<P>All men allow, That &s;hould a Prince command any thing unlawful, either by the Laws of God, or his Kingdom, we are obliged to di&s;obey; which is a kind of Oppo&s;ition, and Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Or &s;hould a Prince invade our Rights where the Law has provided a remedy in the Ca&s;e; all men allow, that it is not unlawful, to oppo&s;e that inva&s;ion in the way of the Law, and to make u&s;e of that remedy again&s;t the Prince.</P>
<P>This therefore is not the Re&s;i&s;tance in di&s;pute; but the Que&s;tion now is, what we may do, as to a forcible Re|&s;i&s;tance of him, &s;o that &s;uppo&s;ing a Prince &s;hould invade the Rights of his &s;ubjects, where they can have no reme|dy by Law, or &s;hould commamd any thing unlawful to be done, and make them &s;uffer in their Rights for not obeying, how far they are oblig'd to &s;ubmit to that &s;uffering, or whether they may oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t him by violence.</P>
<P>Now an An&s;wer to this, I will only ob&s;erve, That if according to the 4th
<PB N="70" REF="014023_0069_0F92ADB4227672E0">and 5th Principles, The Welfare, and by con&s;equence the Rights and proper|ties of the Society ought to be main|tain'd, then we mu&s;t have a Right by nhe Law of Nature to all tho&s;e means that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to that End, which all Societies are oblig'd to maintain, (Principle IV.) and by con|&s;equence any &s;ort of Re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be Lawful, &s;o far as it is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of our Rights and properties.</P>
<P>But then, as that only can be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to an End, without which that End cannot be attain'd; &s;o that Re&s;i&s;tance only can be Lawful, without which our Rights and Properties can|not be &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>When therefore any Prince invades the Rights of the Society, or lays a&s;ide tho&s;e Laws, which are made for their &s;ecurity; and the Society has no imagin|able way left to maintain tho&s;e Laws, and to &s;ecure and defend tho&s;e Rights, but by open and violent Re&s;i&s;tance, that Re&s;i&s;tance is by con&s;equence nece&s;|&s;ary, and lawful.</P>
<P>But here then the Que&s;tion will be, what Rights tho&s;e are, which be of &s;uch Importance to the Society, as that
<PB N="71" REF="014023_0070_0F92ADB48913DA40">its Welfare cannot be &s;ecur'd without them?</P>
<P>For 'tis very certain, a Society may have Rights, which tho' they &s;hould be invaded, yet are not &s;o e&s;&s;ential to its Welfare, as that when they are lo&s;t, the Welfare of the whole mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>The Welfare of the whole con&s;i&s;ts undoubtedly in the Welfare of 'its parts, and therefore the Rights of the parts are the Rights of the whole in &s;ome &s;en&s;e; but yet it would not be Lawful for a Society to take Arms up|on a prviate Injury and Oppre&s;&s;ion, even tho' there &s;hould be no other way to get it redre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e this may be done either thro' ra&s;hne&s;s or neglect, or the Prince may be mi&s;taken or mi&s;led; or if not, how|ever the Welfare of the whole does not depend upon private injury, and the Prince him&s;elf may neverthele&s;s be very intent upon the Welfare of the whole.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the Injury be public and univer&s;al, and the Prince invades the Rights of the Society, in common, yet there are likewi&s;e &s;ome common Rights of the Society, which their Welfare does not &s;o depend upon, as that their
<PB N="72" REF="014023_0071_0F92ADB56D35E9E0">Happine&s;s &s;hall be de&s;troy'd by the lo&s;s of 'em.</P>
<P>For perhaps their Rights may be only invaded in &s;ome few &s;ingle in&s;tances, without any vi&s;ible de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the Society.</P>
<P>Or perhaps it may be only in &s;ome &s;uch ca&s;es, which if continued, might be of dangerous con&s;equence, and tend to the de&s;truction of the Society, but &s;ingly are no great oppre&s;&s;ion in them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>And therefore in &s;uch ca&s;es it would not be lawful to ri&s;e again&s;t a Prince, becau&s;e the Welfare of the whole does not re|quire it; Nay the Welfare of the whole requires the contrary, becau&s;e this would make all Government precarious, and de&s;troy all Peace and Order in Society.</P>
<P>But where the Prince or Government &s;hall de&s;ignedly invade the Rights of the Society without redre&s;s and by the cour&s;e of his proceedings &s;hall evident|ly &s;hew, that he intends to invert the con&s;titution, &s;o that whereas there are Laws made, as Rules for him in the pre&s;ervation of their Rights and Proper|ties, he will not make tho&s;e Laws, but his own Will, his Rule, by the means
<PB N="73" REF="014023_0072_0F92ADB8526BED58">of which the welfare of the Society will become precarious; by the Sixth and Seventh Principles, it will be lawful for the Society to relieve them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But then it mu&s;t be with this provi&s;o, That the remedy be not wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>For if the methods we take to right our&s;elves, will in human probability make the Society more unhappy, than our &s;uffering the pre&s;ent Injuries from the Prince will do; we have then a greater obligation to &s;uffer, than re&s;i&s;t, and that from the very rea&s;on of our Re&s;i&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> The Welfare of the Society.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;ince 'tis plain to all mens Ob&s;ervation, That a violent and tumultuary Re&s;i&s;tance of Princes is commonly attended with war and de|&s;olation, blood and ruin, it will follow,</P>
<P>That whatever we &s;uffer from our Princes, unle&s;s the injury and oppre&s;&s;i|on be of &s;uch great importance to us, as to contervail the hazard of the&s;e con|&s;equences, and &s;ad effects of our Re|&s;i&s;tance, we are oblig'd to &s;uffer and &s;ubmit to them; becau&s;e it is more for the welfare of the Society &s;o to do, as 'tis
<PB N="74" REF="014023_0073_0F92ADB8F9D4C388">better, of the two evils to chu&s;e the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And tho' they happen to have the burthen continued upon them for &s;ome time, tho' it be ever &s;o long, yet if they are oblig'd to con&s;ult the Welfare of the Society, they are oblig'd to &s;uffer &s;till, either till they have a pro&s;pect of Right|ing them&s;elves without the hazard of tho&s;e di&s;mal effects of their Re&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e till they are like to be as mi&s;er|able by their &s;uffering, as they can pro|bably be by their Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>And that a Society may certainly be in many ca&s;es, but e&s;pecially when their Religion is at &s;take, the pre&s;erving of which, as it is of more and greater con|&s;equence, than the lo&s;s of all other things be&s;ides, as much as the &s;oul is better than the body, &s;o it will be always a ju&s;t rea&s;on for Re&s;i&s;tance, whatever the So|ciety &s;uffer by it.</P>
<P>But when I &s;peak of Religion here, I mu&s;t not be under&s;tood to &s;peak of the Religion of &s;ome particular per&s;ons only:</P>
<P>For if every private per&s;on had a power to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection again&s;t his Prince, upon the account of his Religi|on, this would open a gap to continual
<PB N="75" REF="014023_0074_0F92ADB9CD497188">Rebellion, and therefore mu&s;t be fal&s;e by the Sixth and Seventh Principles, becau&s;e it would make all Government precarious, and hazard the Peace and Welfare of Society.</P>
<P>And therefore it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That as I am all along &s;peaking of the Rights of the Society, &s;o when I &s;peak of their Religion, I mean, the Religi|on of the Society, that is the national e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion: And this is then only &s;aid to be at &s;take, when the Laws that are made for thr &s;ecurity of that Religion are laid a&s;ide, and &s;uch methods are vi&s;ibly taken for the intro|ducing a contrary Riligion, as are con|trary to Law in an Arbitrary Tyranni|cal way, without the con&s;ent and con|trary to the judgment of the Society.</P>
<P>And therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e, every Society has a power to defend their Rights, which the Prince is endeavour|ing to take away, becau&s;e the con&s;e|quence of not Re&s;i&s;ting, may tend more to the Mi&s;ery of the Society, than the con&s;equence of Re&s;i&s;ting can do,; as much as the lo&s;s of Heaven to them|&s;elves or their po&s;terity, is of more im|portance
<PB N="76" REF="014023_0075_0F92ADBA98A207C0">and concern to them, than the lo&s;s of all other things be&s;ides.</P>
<P>And if &s;o, from hence it is plain, that the foundation of Government, Obedi|ence and Re&s;i&s;tance, is the &s;ame; They all &s;tand upon the &s;ame foot, and are all branches of the &s;ame root, and there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for All, as there is for any of 'em</P>
<P>And therefore, if it be a good argu|ment, for the Divine Authority of Go|vernment, as we have before &s;hewn, (<HI>Page</HI> 29.) That it is a nece&s;&s;ary means to the Happine&s;s of the Society, a nece&s;|&s;ary End appointed by God in the very nature of things; it will follow, that it mu&s;t be as good an argument of a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion for Re&s;i&s;tance, when 'tis a nece&s;&s;ary means to the &s;ame End, which, as it is the only thing that can make it Lawful, &s;o it is the only Rule to judge by, when and how far it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>But who &s;hall be judge of this nece&s;&s;ity, is the Que&s;tion; and it has always been the great difficulty in &s;tat|ing this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>But after all, I take it to be &s;uch a difficulty, as has ari&s;en chiefly from the
<PB N="77" REF="014023_0076_0F92ADBB44EF4670">manner of &s;tating and handling this point.</P>
<P>For many, who have wrote upon this &s;ubject, have, too commonly, content|ed them&s;elves with what they thought a confutation of the doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance in general, from thence in|fering the lawfulne&s;s of the contrary; but not having determin'd the ju&s;t bounds, how far we are oblig'd to &s;uffer, before it can be lawful to Re&s;i&s;t, they have left the point they contend for al|together u&s;ele&s;s, if not dangerous.</P>
<P>For tho' it be lawful to Re&s;i&s;t in ca&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, yet we have &s;hewn it is not &s;o in every oppre&s;&s;ion (<HI>Principle.</HI> VIII.) and therefore, unle&s;s they &s;hew us, how far we are to bear oppre&s;&s;ion, before we Re&s;i&s;t, they realy do nothing to any purpo&s;e, but on the contrary, put a &s;word into mad-mens hands, and &s;et open a door to Rebellion, and Con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>They &s;hew us indeed a remedy for our grievances, but 'tis &s;uch a one, as we had as well be without, as not to know when, and how to u&s;e it, without the &s;ame danger, as when we had it
<PB N="78" REF="014023_0077_0F92ADBC1805FA88">not: And 'tis this, that has given oc|ca&s;ion for this puzzling Que&s;tion, Who &s;hall be judge?</P>
<P>Whereas, as we here &s;et the ca&s;e, there does not &s;eem any room for this objection.</P>
<P>For, as we have here laid down a Rule, by which we are to mea&s;ure our Submi&s;&s;ion to Princes, every one mu&s;t be a Judge of Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o far as he is a Judge of this Rule.</P>
<P>And therefore, &s;ince we have here &s;hewn, that it is not lawful to make head again&s;t our Prince upon a private injury, nor,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> For a public, unle&s;s it be of dangerous con&s;equence to the Con|&s;titution, and &s;uch as is notoriou&s;ly intended for its de&s;truction, and &s;uch too, as he refu&s;es to redre&s;s; nor,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Even then, unle&s;s the da|mage the Society actually does, or which is the &s;ame thing, unavoidably will, &s;uffer by it, if not prevented, be as great a mi&s;ery to them, as the con|&s;equences of their Re&s;i&s;tance will pro|bably be.</P>
<P>And &s;ince this may happen in Ci|vil matters, but e&s;pecially when Religi|on

<P N="1">1. Then, as every &s;en&s;ible hone&s;t man who unde&s;tands the Con&s;titution and Laws, is capable of judging of the&s;e things, that is, is capable of judging when a Prince is acting contrary to the Laws of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, and &s;etting up another in its &s;tead:</P>
<P N="2">2. And as every &s;en&s;ible man is capable of comparing the pre&s;ent injuries the Society &s;uffers, with blood, and plun|der, and all the &s;ad con&s;equences of Civil War;</P>
<P N="3">3. And as every &s;en&s;ible man is ca|pable of judging whether there be a pro&s;pect of righting them&s;elves with|out the hazard of the&s;e &s;ad con&s;equences:</P>
<P>So every &s;en&s;ible man mu&s;t by con|&s;equence be capable of judging, when it may lawful to Re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But tho' every &s;en&s;ible man may be a competant judge in this ca&s;e, to the &s;atifaction of own con&s;cience, yet in &s;uch a Government as ours is, where
<PB N="80" REF="014023_0079_0F92ADBDA3503CC8">the Intere&s;ts of the People are intru&s;ted in &s;ome particular hands, as among&s;t us in Lords and Commons, who have a Right in the di&s;po&s;al of affairs; as they are therefore the be&s;t and the pro|per judges, how far the Rights of the Society are invaded, and what is nece&s;|&s;ary for their &s;ecurity; &s;o it &s;eems but natural to conclude, where a Parlia|ment can be had, that no Re&s;i&s;tance ought to be made, till the Parliament has declar'd their un&s;ufferable grie|vances, and &s;ought un&s;ucce&s;sfully for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>And therefore, 'its the intere&s;t of the Society to have frequent Parlia|ment, as a nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;ecuri|ty to the con&s;titution. For as the con&s;titution cannot well be &s;up|po&s;ed capable of being overturned u|pon a &s;udden, &s;o in the ca&s;e of any In|jury to the Society, by frequent Par|liaments, we can never be without a convenient opportunity, and a proper method of relief.</P>
<P>But as it was not &s;o in former Reigns, &s;o where the Judgment of Par|liament could not be had, every man
<PB N="81" REF="014023_0080_0F92ADBE40CE2D40">was then to judge for him&s;elf, and to act according to his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But then, as the proper method for redre&s;s of grievances in a Parliamenta|ry Monarchy, is by the way of Parlia|ments; &s;o by con&s;equence, in ca&s;e of an injury, or oppre&s;&s;ion from our Princes in tho&s;e times, the fir&s;t thing every one ought to have endeavoured after, was, the Liberty of a Parlia|ment; which if the Prince would con|&s;ent to, then all other extraordinary methods would be unlawful; For 'tis the nece&s;&s;ity of Re&s;i&s;tance that alone can make it Lawful.</P>
<P>And as that can never be a nece&s;&s;ary means to an End, where the End can be attained without tho&s;e means, &s;o that can never be nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecu|rity of the Rights and Properties of the Society, without which they may be otherwi&s;e &s;ecured, and by con&s;equence Re&s;i&s;tance can never be &s;aid to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, where the Prince is willing to redre&s;s the grievance, and con&s;ent to any other rea&s;onable means of their &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>And therefore, could it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Lords, and Commons could
<PB N="82" REF="014023_0081_0F92ADBF0A532C58">agree to declare for Re&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that Declaration would doubt|le&s;s be unlawful.</P>
<P>And tho' they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed the be&s;t Judges of the &s;everal Intere&s;ts of the Society, yet as they are but a part of the Society, we are not obliged by the Rules of the Con&s;ttiution to act according to their Judgment, any farther than we our&s;elves are &s;atisfied, 'tis Lawful, and by con&s;equence we cannot be obliged to Re&s;i&s;tance by any Declaration they &s;hould make, any o|therwi&s;e than we our&s;elves &s;hould judge it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>There may be many ca&s;es, where I may be obliged not to act without the Judgment of others; but there can be no ca&s;e, where I can be obliged to act again&s;t my own, where the morality of the action is in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we have already &s;hewn, that every &s;en&s;ible man is capable of Judging, when it may be Lawful to Re&s;i&s;t, and thereby &s;atisfie him&s;elf in joining with any Declaration of Par|liament, where it can be had, or in u&s;ing any other methods, he thinks to be nece&s;&s;ary, where the Judgment of
<PB N="83" REF="014023_0082_0F92ADC030081CB0">Parliament cannot be had, he ought not by con&s;equence to join with any &s;uch Judgment of Parliament, any far|ther than he is convinced within him|&s;elf it is a Ju&s;t and Lawful Judgment, and may Ju&s;tly and Lawfully be join|ed with.</P>
<P>As this is a Matter of the la&s;t impor|tance, &s;o we ought to be very wary how we act in it, and therefore we ought never to venture on an at|tempt of this nature, without being &s;ure of the ground we go on.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e and good man would not do any thing, that may rea&s;onably be doubted whether it be Lawful; and therefore tho' we are as certain, as we can be of any thing, that Re&s;i&s;tance is Lawful, yet we &s;hould in prudence <HI>rather choo&s;e to &s;uffer too much than Re&s;i&s;t too &s;oon.</HI></P>
<P>The utmo&s;t degree of what is Law|ful, is the very edge of &s;in, and one would not willingly come &s;o near, as to &s;plit the hair.</P>
<P>And therefore when we think it nece&s;|&s;ary to Re&s;i&s;t, the Nece&s;&s;ity of our Re&s;i&s;t|ance ought to be very certain; The In|jury &s;uffered ought to be &s;o very noto|rious,
<PB N="84" REF="014023_0083_0F92ADC321EFBE80">that every eye may &s;ee it, and the danger to be prevented ought to be &s;o very apparent, that no rea&s;onable man can doubt of it.</P>
<P>For this is a remedy for the di&s;ea&s;es of the Body Politic, like tho&s;e, that are &s;ometimes u&s;ed for the Natural Body, which either Kill, or Cure; and there|fore we ought to be tender in the u&s;e of them, unle&s;s it be in an evidently dangerous, and de&s;perate ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But tho' in &s;uch a ca&s;e a People may have a Right to Re&s;i&s;t, yet here a material Que&s;tion will ari&s;e, Whether a People may not give away their Rights, and by con&s;equence their Rights of Re&s;i&s;tance?</P>
<P>For &s;ince, as we have before &s;hewn, (Pag. 31, 32.) every one is obliged in duty to God to obey the Laws of the Society, &s;o far as they are agreeable to the Will of God; if the Society has made a Law to forbid Re&s;i&s;tance, and thereby given away their Right to it, it mu&s;t be therefore unlawful to Re&s;i&s;t, &s;o far as they had a Power to make that Law, and give away that Right.</P>
<P>But that they have not a Power to make &s;uch a Law, and give away this
<PB N="85" REF="014023_0084_0F92ADC386A30920">Right, is as certain a truth as that they have not a Power to act contrary to the Will of God.</P>
<P>For we have already &s;hewn (<HI>Principle</HI> IV.) That it is the Will of God, that the Happine&s;s of Society be maintain'd and by con&s;equence, that &s;uch Re&s;i&s;t|ance be made by every Society, as in the nature of things is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ecure and maintain their Happine&s;s. And therefore for any Soci|ety to make a Law again&s;t all re&s;i&s;tance ab&s;olutely is to forbid that, as unlawful, which God has made nece&s;&s;ary; and therefore to do that, which they have not a Power to do, becau&s;e 'tis con|trary to the Will of God.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome to &s;ay this, which is a doctrine &s;o contrary to the common prejudices; but we &s;ee it mu&s;t be &s;o in the nature of things, if the Wel|fare of Society ought to be maintain'd.</P>
<P>But yet it may be plau&s;ibly urged in this ca&s;e, That every one has a Power to di&s;po&s;e of his own, and if he thinks fit, may make him&s;elf a &s;lave; he may either give away his Right and Pro|perty, or he may oblige him&s;elf not to
<PB N="86" REF="014023_0085_0F92ADC44128F770">defend 'em, whenever they &s;hall be taken from him; And what a man may do of him&s;elf, he may do by an|other, that is duly commi&s;&s;ion'd to act for him; and whatever is &s;o done by another for him, lays as great an Ob|ligation on him to perform it as if it were done in his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And therefore, as in every Society, there is a nece&s;&s;ity, that the affairs of the Public be intru&s;ted in &s;ome particu|lar hands to act for the whole; &s;o what|ever tho&s;e Per&s;ons &s;o intru&s;ted do for the Society, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as done by the whole, and to lay as great an obligation on every member of the Society, as if it had been done by them|&s;elves in per&s;on: And therefore if they make a Law to give away our Rights, or forbid the nece&s;&s;ary defence of 'em, every member of the Society is by con|&s;equence to be &s;uppos'd under a nece&s;|&s;ary obligation to keep that Law.</P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to this; Tho' it mu&s;t be allowed, as an undoubted truth, That every one has a to Power di&s;po&s;e of his own Rights, &s;o far as they are his own, con&s;ider'd &s;imply, and of him&s;elf alone; yet if he be con&s;ider'd relatively, as a
<PB N="87" REF="014023_0086_0F92ADC4F1100730">member of Society; &s;o far as the Rights of others depend upon his defending and maintaining his own; they are not then intirely his own, and he has no &s;uch Right to give 'em up, but on the contrary, is under an Obligation to defend 'em, it being the duty of every member of the Society, to do what is nece&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of the Society.</P>
<P>This may be illu&s;trated by the Ca&s;e of the Robber who takes away our goods, tho' the goods perhaps be &s;uch, as we are content to lo&s;e, and give up our Right to, rather than pro&s;ecute the offender; yet &s;o far as the non-pro&s;e|cution of the offender, may be of ill con&s;equencce to Society, as we are members of Society, and oblig'd to &s;upport the Society, we are under an obligation in con&s;cience to pro&s;ecute, and the Society has a Right to that pro|&s;ecution. And &s;hould an Oath be given us not to pro&s;ecute, that Oath, wou'd be <HI>Ip&s;o facto</HI> void, as being an Oath again&s;t a prior Obligation, an Oath again&s;t doing Ju&s;tice, and therefore an unlawful Oath.</P>
<P>And by the &s;ame rea&s;on, if Re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="88" REF="014023_0087_0F92ADC5D7CC0E68">be a real Duty, and a Right, which in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity the Society may de|mand of us, when an Oath of Allegi|ance is given to Subjects, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as 'tis Lawful to be perform'd in, and by con&s;equence in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to allow of &s;uch Re|&s;i&s;tance, as the Society has a Right to, otherwi&s;e it would be an Oath to the Prince to do wrong to the people, and therefore an unlwful Oath, and by con|&s;equence, <HI>Ip&s;o facto</HI> void.</P>
<P>And &s;o likewi&s;e as to other part of the argument, tho' a man may do that by another, which he has a power to do of him&s;elf, and is as much oblig'd by what is &s;o done, as if it were done by him&s;elf, yet nothing can be &s;aid to be done by another for us, &s;o as in Equi|ty and Rea&s;on to lay an Obligation on us any farther, than as he who does the thing, is impower'd and commi&s;&s;ion'd by us; or as the thing he does is agree|able to the End and Rea&s;on of that commi&s;&s;ion he receiv'd from us.</P>
<P>Should an Attorney for In&s;tance, or a Guardian, that is impower'd to act in our &s;tead in the &s;ecurity of our Rights, give away tho&s;e Rights he was impowered
<PB N="89" REF="014023_0088_0F92ADC695FE7670">to pre&s;erve; it cannot be &s;aid, he had a commi&s;ion to do this, or that this ought to oblige in rea&s;on, and con&s;cience where we have a power to help our|&s;elves. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, tho' in every Society, the Rights of the whole are &s;uppos'd to be intru&s;ted in &s;ome particular hands, yet as this is done on|ly for &s;upport of Government, the End of which is, the Welfare of Society in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and Pro|perties; it will follow, that tho&s;e per|&s;ons &s;o intru&s;ted to act for the whole, are not to be under&s;tood to have any commi&s;&s;ion to do any thing, that is con|trary to the End and Rea&s;on of their tru&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion; and by con&s;e|quence mu&s;t be under&s;tood to have no commi&s;&s;ion; and therefore no Right to in&s;lave the Society, by giving up their common Rights and Properties, or forbiding us to defend 'em in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, this being contrary to the very Endand Rea&s;on of that con&s;ti|tion, by which they are power|ed to act for Society. They have a power, no doubt, to give away any Right, the alienation of which is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of the whole, and if we could &s;uppo&s;e we
<PB N="90" REF="014023_0089_0F92ADC7421E8AA0">had any Right granted to us, of re&s;i&s;t|ing our Governors in any &s;uch manner, or for any &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as is incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Welfare of the whole, they have, double&s;s, a power to give it away, (and if they &s;hould not give it away, it wou'd be void in it&s;elf, as be|ing in the nature of things unlawful;) be|cau&s;e, by the Seventh Principle, any action is unlawful that is contrary to the Welfare of the Soicety: But to give away all our Rights and Properties at once; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to for bid us the means that are &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry to their pre&s;ervation, that they cannot be &s;ecur'd without them, this they have no more Power or right to do, than they have a Right to authorize Thieves and murtherers to take away our lives, or goods, or to oblige us not to defend our &s;elves again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame both with Prince and People; for as the Prince, who is the Mini&s;ter of God for good, cannot be &s;uppos'd to have any commi&s;&s;ion from God, to ruin or de&s;troy his people &s;o neither can they who are intru&s;ted with the affairs of any Society to con|rive and manage for the Welfare of
<PB N="91" REF="014023_0090_0F92ADC7F9302EB8">the whole, be in rea&s;on &s;uppos'd to have any commi&s;&s;ion to give away their Rights or properties, in which their Welfare does con&s;i&s;t. (Principle V. P. 12.)</P>
<P>But on the contrary, they are oblig'd in Duty to God and their country, to maintain and defend their tru&s;t, and by con&s;equence are oblig'd to &s;uch Re&s;i&s;t|ance, as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to that End.</P>
<P>This is &s;o very plain a ca&s;e, that I dare appeal to any one's common Rea&s;on, tho' never &s;o great a Bigot to his No|tions, whether he &s;hould not think it a Trayterous and Unlawful part, &s;hould they who are intru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts of a Society, knowingly and wilfully give 'em up into the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of their Prince: And if it be unlawful to give them up, it mu&s;t be then their duty to defend them, and by con&s;e|quence it mu&s;t be equally their duty to defend them by all &s;uch ways and means, as are ab&s;ulutely nece&s;&s;ary for their de|fence.</P>
<P>And therefore, as I &s;aid before (page 70 71.) in all &s;uch Governments, as ours is, where the Intere&s;ts of the So|ciety are intru&s;ted with a Parliament,
<PB N="92" REF="014023_0091_0F92ADC8CF0064A0">as they are oblig'd in duty to defend them, &s;o in a regular cour&s;e of things, where a Free Parliament can be had, the Fir&s;t Defence of our Rights &s;hould begin there, and nothing &s;hould be done by others, till they have us'd their be&s;t endeavours for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>And if a Free Parliament cannot be had, or if they have endeavour'd for re|lief in vain, then every one mu&s;t be le&s;t to his own con&s;cience, to act as he thinks be&s;t for the Welfare of the Society, ac|cording to the foregoing limitations; (page 69, 70.)</P>
<P>Thus, I think, we have a full re|&s;olution of this Point, and &s;uch a one as &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be fal&s;e, if my foregoing Principles be true.</P>
<P>But yet, I'm very &s;en&s;ible, notwith|&s;tanding this, there are many with whom this doctrine of Re&s;i&s;tance will not re|li&s;h, by rea&s;on of that impious and hor|rid abu&s;e of it in the barbarous murther of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.</P>
<P>As there are others, on the other hand, who are as much afraid of Non-Re&s;i&s;t|ance le&s;t is &s;hould &s;trike at the Revolu|tion in favour of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas 'tis evident, the&s;e extremes
<PB N="93" REF="014023_0092_0F92ADC9935781F0">in opinion can never be ju&s;tified on ei|ther hand.</P>
<P>For we have already &s;hewn, there is a Lawful Re&s;i&s;tance, tho it may be a|bus'd; and there is a Non-Re&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary, tho' it be often mi&s;taken; and the light we have now &s;et them both in, will give us a ju&s;t view of tho&s;e events, the one of Great and Glorious, the other of Scandalous and Execrable Memory.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Late Civil War condemn'd.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> According to the Principles here laid down, we have a hor|rid Idea &s;et before us of the dete&s;ta|ble Murther of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, and the irrgular and unju&s;t proceedings of the People in that unnatural Civil War.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> We have &s;hewn, that a few &s;ingle In&s;tances to the prejudice of a peo|ple, is not a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of Re&s;i&s;tance, if the Prince, upon the people's putting in a claim to their Rights, and inform|ing him of the wrong, is willing to redre&s;s the Injury; and if he &s;hou'd not be willing to do this. <HI>Secondly,</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;hewn (page 64, 65.) That even then it will not be lawful to re&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s the Injury be a greater
<PB N="94" REF="014023_0093_0F92ADCA3A5424E8">mi&s;ery to the Society, than the con&s;e|quence of Re&s;i&s;tance is like to be. And if &s;o,</P>
<P>Then nothing can ju&s;tify that Civil War. For tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that &s;ome irregular actions were done by the King, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd too on the other hand, that they were &s;uch, as he was advis'd were lawful to be done, and &s;uch as when done, were no great oppre&s;&s;ion in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And as for the bad con&s;equences of his proceedings in tho&s;e particulars, when his people expre&s;s'd their unea&s;i|ne&s;s at them, and put in a claim to their Rights in Parliament, he was not only willing to redre&s;s their pre&s;ent grie|vance, but to comply with any means, that could be thought rea&s;onable to pre|vent any future inconvenience: And this he did in &s;o full a manner, that even the then pretended Parliament them|&s;elves voted his conce&s;&s;ions &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>And when he had done this as Re&s;i&s;t|ance could be no longer nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o it could by con&s;equence be no longer law|ful.</P>
<P>And therefore to proceed in the man|ner they did, mu&s;t be Rebellion in the
<PB N="95" REF="014023_0094_0F92ADCAEE3BB180">highe&s;t degree, or el&s;e there could be no &s;uch thing in nature.</P>
<P>But granting he had made no &s;atisfac|tion to his people, nor given any new &s;ecurity for their Rights and Properties; nay, &s;uppo&s;ing he had continued to op|pre&s;s them, yet we have further &s;hewn, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e the King only for|bids his right and cea&s;es to Govern his People, and by con&s;equence can forfeit no more than his Government.</P>
<P>As He refu&s;es them his Protection, &s;o they may refu&s;es him their Obedi|ence, but this does not give them any Power over his Per&s;on;</P>
<P>And therefore for them to put him to death, even tho' they had been the whole body of the people, but much more for a few particular per&s;ons to do it, and that too contrary to the general &s;en&s;e of the people, mu&s;t be murther in the highe&s;t degree, or there can be no &s;uch thing in nature.</P>
<P>This is not only true from the Prin|ciples laid down; but it is al&s;o evident, even from our famous <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> &s;o often quoted to ju&s;tify Re&s;i&s;tance; even this puts the Per&s;on of the King out of the People's Power, even whil&s;t it gives them a Power to di&s;tre&s;s him in
<PB N="96" REF="014023_0095_0F92ADCBB8AACA48">his Ca&s;tles, or u&s;e any other means for their &s;ecurity; and &s;ure if this be of any authority, the King has as much Right to the benefit of it on his part, as the People can pretend on theirs; and if it gives them a privilege to &s;ecure their own Rights, &s;o it gives him a Right to be &s;ecured in his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>So that this mu&s;t be a horrid and de|te&s;table wickedne&s;s, if Murther and Re|bellion be &s;o:</P>
<P>And therefore they who pretend to ju&s;tify this Fact, mu&s;t be men of bar|barous and cruel Minds, and govern'd more by their pa&s;&s;ions than their con|&s;ciences.</P>
<P>If &s;uch Principles and &s;uch Practices upon &s;uch Pretences were to be allowed, they would make the Right of Princes and the Peace of Society, the mo&s;t pre|carious thing that can be, and lays open to the In&s;ults of every <HI>Ma&s;&s;inello,</HI> who has but impudence enough to charge the Government with Popery or Tyranny, or being in a <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Intere&s;t, and cunning enough to time it with &s;ome popular di&s;content,</P>
<P>And therefore as by the Sixth Princi|ple already laid down, the&s;e notions mu&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="014023_0096_0F92ADCD31F92AC8">nece&s;&s;arily be fal&s;e, and &s;uch facts unlaw|ful; &s;o they ought to be abhorr'd and di&s;courag'd by every wi&s;e and good Man, who has any regard to his duty or intere&s;t, to the Society's peace, or his own &s;afety,</P>
<P>But tho' our notions of Government do thus evidently demon&s;trate the un|lawfulne&s;s of tho&s;e practices in the late Civil Wars, yet they do,</P>

<P>And if our Rights and Religion were at &s;take, when we &s;aw all our mounds pull'd down, and our inclo&s;ure laid open, and a contrary Religion &s;etting up among&s;t us; when a di&s;pen&s;ing Pow|er was maintain'd to void all the Laws that were made for our &s;ecurity, and

When our Properties were to be held at the Will of the King, who evidently &s;hew'd, it &s;hould be no longer than he &s;hould find it for his purpo&s;e not to de|&s;troy them.</P>
<P>If our Rights and Religion were at &s;take, when Popery was planting it &s;elf in our Univer&s;ities, and the members depriv'd of their Legal Properties con|trary to <HI>Law,</HI> for not doing that, which was contrary <HI>to their Oaths,</HI> to make room for Papi&s;ts unqualified <HI>by Law</HI> and all this with a High Hand by the bare Authority of the King, only becau&s;e he would, and for this End only, as was notoriou&s;ly evident, that he might cor|rupt the fountain, from whence our Religion is to be nouri&s;h'd and &s;upport|ed, and the lower &s;treams to be &s;uppli|ed</P>
<P>If our Rights and Religion were at &s;take, when under the&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions, the injur'd &s;ubjects put in their claims by humble and obedient Petitions, which was the only method in their power, becau&s;e a Free Parliament could not be had, but all without any redre&s;s

<P>And when all the&s;e proceedings were &s;upported by the power of a &s;tand|ing Army, without the con&s;ent, and con|trary to the Judgment of the Parliament, and &s;ome part of that Army commanded by Popi&s;h Officers, and a great Part of it made up of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts, who were by Intere&s;t and Principle engag'd to de|&s;troy, both our Properties and Religion.</P>
<P>If our Rights and Religion were at &s;take in the&s;e ca&s;es, as no rea&s;onable man can, and, I believe, no unprejudiced Man will, and I'm &s;ure, in tho&s;e times no &s;en&s;ible man did que&s;tion, but on the contrary, the circum&s;tances were &s;o notorious, and the danger &s;o apparent, not from one, or two &s;ingle In&s;tances, but from a continued Series of Actions, that every heart was fill'd with Fears, &amp; Complaints were heard in every mouth, Then certainly we had, or there can be no &s;uch thing, as a ju&s;t and lawful Cau&s;e of Re&s;i&s;tance.

<P><PB N="101" REF="014023_0100_0F92ADD8AE36A870">
But the Right and Title of his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty, does not depend upon this alone: He Injoys his Crown by an Here|ditary Right devolv'd upon Him from the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia.</HI> And this Right was &s;ettled and confirm'd to Her by all that Legal Power and Authority, that can give any Right in any Society, that is, by the Power of the Crown, and Par|liament, with whom all the Rights of our Society are lodg'd,</P>
<P>So that if His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty has not a Right to Govern us, it mu&s;t be either upon this account, that the Crown and Parliament, have not any Right to determine the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Gover|ment, or el&s;e that the Succe&s;&s;ion has not been Legally &s;ettled by a Lawful King, and Parliament.</P>
<P>This is the hinge of the whole di&s;|pute; And as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, It is very certain, that as the Right of Go|verning any Society is the Ordinance of Men, and therefore may be determin'd, and &s;ettled by Men, &s;o every Society mu&s;t have a General Right to it, accor|ding as is be&s;t for their own Welfare, (<HI>Page</HI> 42.) And as we have this Right in common with other Societies, from
<PB N="102" REF="014023_0101_0F92ADDB7771C190">the nature and rea&s;on of things, &s;o we have it likewi&s;e by our particular con|&s;titution, as being a Right declar'd by Law, to be inherent in the Crown and Parliament. So that what&s;oever is &s;o done by the Crown and Parliament, they have a Natural and Legal Right to do, and as the intere&s;ts of the Society is lodg'd in them, the Society mu&s;t be determin'd by 'em: And &s;ince this is the foundation of our pre&s;ent Settlement, and the King &s;ucceeds to the Throne by this, as He mu&s;t have a Legal Right to Govern, we mu&s;t be oblig'd in Duty to Obey.</P>
<P>The only remaining Difficulty is, Whether this Settlement was Legally made by a Lawful King, and Parliament?</P>
<P>Now as to this Objection, it may be an&s;wer'd, That, tho' this Settlement was made in the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> who had not a Regular Hereditary Right, yet if the Revolution was, as we have proved it Lawful, as being a ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and therefore Lawful Means for the attainment of a Lawful End, He mu&s;t therefore be a Lawful and Right|ful King: And by con&s;equence mu&s;t have a Power and Right to do, what
<PB N="103" REF="014023_0102_0F92ADDC37952040">any other Lawful King could do.</P>
<P>But when we con&s;ider further, That by the Law and Con&s;titution of our Kingdom, the Authority of the King in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is allow'd, however He came by that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that All Acts of Parliament pa&s;s'd by Him, are equally to be Obey'd, as of equal Force with theirs, who&s;e Titles were Indi&s;|putable, (as Dr. <HI>Higden</HI> has demon|&s;trated) then this Act of Parliament for the Settlement of the Crown, mu&s;t be as valid and obliging as any other Act of any other King and Parliament could be, that is, it mu&s;t give the King as good a Title to the Crown, and make it as much the People's Duty to Obey, as any other Act of Parliament could do.</P>
<P>But here we may &s;till con&s;ider fur|ther, That this Settlement was not only made by King <HI>William,</HI> but was after|wards confirm'd by the Authority of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> who&s;e Right and Title every one allow'd, even they who refu&s;e All glance to the King: And if &s;he had a Right, as undoubtedly &s;he had, then &s;he had a Right to do in Her Reign, what the Crown had a Right to do in any Reign, and &s;ince &s;he, an undoubted|ly
<PB N="104" REF="014023_0103_0F92ADDD01DDE7C0">Lawful Queen, has confirm'd the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Prote&s;tant Line, by the concurrence of an undoubtedly Lawful Parliament, (which they had an Inherent Right to do) it will follow, that His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty had, as ju&s;t a Right to the Succe&s;&s;ion, and has now as ju&s;t a claim to our Allegiance, as Rea&s;on, and Law can give Him.</P>
<P>And as the &s;ame Power, that could and did &s;ettle it thus, could and did ac|tually exclude all others, and there|fore hath not only given Him a Right, but has by con&s;equence given Him the only Right; &s;o it is the Duty of every Subject not only to receive Him for their Prince, but for their only Right|ful and Lawful Prince, again&s;t all other Pretenders what&s;over.</P>

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> IF all the Principles we have laid down, and the Rea&s;onings there|upon be True, from hence we are taught the Obligations, that Governors and Subjects have upon 'em, and the Duties that are &s;everally requir'd of 'em, in order to an happy Government.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="014023_0104_0F92ADDDCCF229C8">
For if the End of all Government be the Welfare of Society, then He only can be a good Governor, and they only good Subjects, who con&s;ult the public Good in their &s;everal capacities; The Prince the Welfare of His Subjects, and the Subjects the Welfare of their Prince.</P>
<P>And as the Public Welfare con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecurity of the Society in their Rights and Properties; &s;o it is not only the Duty, but the Intere&s;t of a Prince, to maintain the Rights of his People, and the People to &s;upport the Rights of the Prince.</P>
<P>And as the Laws of the Society, are the Rules of the &s;everal Rights of the Society, &s;o tho&s;e &s;everal Rights cannot be &s;ecur'd, unle&s;s tho&s;e Laws be the Rule of their &s;everal Actions; that is, unle&s;s the People ob&s;erve every thing, that the Laws repuire, and the Prince command nothing, but what the Laws allow.</P>
<P>And as Laws are not only made, as Rules, but as a common Security to the Rights of the Society, &s;o the common Security mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;t in the punctual execution of the Laws, and &s;o far as the Society are wanting in this
<PB N="106" REF="014023_0105_0F92ADDE75BA68E8">re&s;pect, that is, &s;o far as the Prince &s;hall pretend to di&s;pen&s;e with them, and the People be carele&s;s in the Execution of 'em, &s;o far they are defective in their Duty, and wanting to the Common Good and Security.</P>
<P>For as the Prince and People are but one Society, united together for the Welfare of the whole, they mu&s;t have a Right to each other's duty, as nece&s;&s;ary to the Common Good, and by con&s;e|quence &s;o far as either part, that is, ei|ther Prince, or people are wanting in their re&s;pective duties to each other, &s;o far they are wanting to the Common Good, which God has oblig'd them to con&s;ult.</P>
<P>And therefore tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who &s;hall contribute towards this, by magnifying the Prerogative of the Crown &s;o far, as to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy the Rights of the People, or under a pretence of main|taining the Rights of the People, &s;hall le&s;&s;en the Security of the Crown, are equally Enemies to the Common Good, and equally Fal&s;e to God and their Country.</P>
<P>Thus we have gone thro' the E&s;&s;en|tials of Government, relating both to
<PB N="107" REF="014023_0106_0F92ADDF3A5D9AC8">the Governors, and Subjects, and &s;hewn the Obligation they have to one ano|ther; By the &s;ame Principles we may be able to model our notions of the &s;everal Forms of it, and it particularly &s;hews us in the fir&s;t place, how far any Form of Government may be alter'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD><HI>COROLLARY V.</HI> How far any Form of Government may be alter'd.</HEAD>
<P>We have already &s;hewn, that every Society has an Inherent Right, to put them&s;elves under any Form of Govern|ment that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their own Welfare, according to their &s;everal circum&s;tances; and as all Forms of Government were originally the Or|dinances of men, &s;o they are by con&s;e|quence alterable by men, and therefore there can be no &s;uch Right of Govern|ing in any Per&s;on, or Family, as is pro|perly, and in its own nature Indefen&s;i|ble: But then, tho' all Forms of Govern|ment were the Ordinances of men, yet as they were Ordain'd for the Wel|fare of Society, &s;o far, and no farther
<PB N="108" REF="014023_0107_0F92ADE08B80A038">ought they to be alter'd, than the Wel|fare of the Society requires the alterati|on.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the Welfare of the Society con&s;i&s;ts, as we have &s;hewn, in the &s;e|curity of the Rights and Properties of the Society, that Form of Government only can be &s;aid to require an alterati|on, under which the Rights and Pro|perties of the Society cannot be &s;e|cur'd:</P>
<P>And as they who are intru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts, and imploy'd to act for the Welfare of the Society, are the only pro|per Judges of its Welfare, &s;o by con&s;e|quence they are not only proper Judges, when, and what alterations &s;hall be made, but they are the only Per&s;ons, that can make 'em. And therefore in any particular Con&s;titution, &s;uppo&s;e this of ours in this Kingdom, where the In|tere&s;ts of the Society are put into the hands, and left to the di&s;po&s;al of the Crown, and Parliament, tho' this Form of Government was originally the Or|dinance of the Society, and is therefore alterable by any Society, yet it is not to be done by any other Per&s;ons, nor in any other manner, than by the concur|rence
<PB N="109" REF="014023_0108_0F92ADE0E2C75200">of the Crown and Parliament. The Crown cannot do it without the Parlia|ment nor the Parliament without the Crown. For tho' we &s;uppo&s;e the rights of Princes are intirely owing to the People, and the People had a Power originally in them&s;elves, not to have united under the Form, yet after they have con&s;ented, and &s;ubmitted to it, the Power they had once, is given away, &s;o long as that Union continues, and the Power and Prerogative they have given their Prince are as much His Right, whil&s;t He does the duty of their Prince, as the Privile|ges they re&s;erve to them&s;elves are Theirs.</P>
<P>And therefore as he cannot Lawfully invade their Privileges without Tyran|ny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;o neither can they Lawfully re&s;i&s;t His Power, nor Intrench on His Prerogative without Trea&s;on and Rebellion.</P>
<P>And by Con&s;equence in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, no alteration can be made by either, without the mutual con&s;ent of both.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be true, I &s;ay, &s;o long as this Union and Con&s;titution continues:</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="014023_0109_0F92ADE16D8D1260">
But &s;hould this Union and Con&s;tituti|on expire of it &s;elf, or be any otherwi&s;e broken and di&s;&s;olv'd, by which the Peo|ple are di&s;charg'd from their Obligations to their Prince, and are by con&s;equence reduced to the &s;tate they were in, before that Union and Con&s;titution was made, as they have then the &s;ame Natural Right to &s;ettle them&s;elves again, either in the &s;ame, or any other Form, as if they had never been &s;ettled before; &s;o whatever the Per&s;ons in that Ca&s;e do who are intru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts of the Society, every Member of the So|ciety, is oblig'd to &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>But here then the Que&s;tion will be, How this Union and Con&s;titution can Expire of it &s;elf, or can be &s;o broken and di&s;&s;olv'd, as to put the Society into &s;uch a State, as if that Union and Con&s;tituti|on had never been made.</P>
<P>Now this may be, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Upon a &s;up|po&s;ition that the Royal Family, by whom the Society has agreed to be Govern'd in Succe&s;&s;ion, is extinct, and &s;o no Per&s;on has any Legal Claim to Go|vern them; In &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Society may put them&s;elves under any other per&s;ons or any other Form, becau&s;e the
<PB N="111" REF="014023_0110_0F92ADE2348D3F40">former con&s;titution is expir'd: Or,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Union and Con&s;titution may be di&s;&s;olv'd, when the Prince will not &s;ubmit to the Terms and Conditions of the Con&s;titution, nor perform the Contract by which they are united: For as the End and Rea&s;on of Government is the Welfare of Society in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and Properties, &s;o the different Forms and Con&s;titutions are only &s;everal means to this End:</P>
<P>And therefore when a Prince takes upon Him the Government of a People, it is in the nature of the thing &s;uppos'd, and He does thereby virtually Contract and Agree, not only to con&s;ult the Wel|fare of that People, but to do it in that way, that they have appointed: So that for In&s;tance in &s;uch a Government as ours, where we have not only our par|ticular Rights and Properties, a&s;&s;ur'd to us by Law, but al&s;o &s;uch a certain Form and Con&s;titution, where no Rights can be alien'd, nor Laws be made, but by the Advice and Con&s;ent of Parliament, it is in the nature of the thing &s;uppos'd, and He who takes upon Him this Government, does there|by tacitly Contract, that He will not
<PB N="112" REF="014023_0111_0F92ADE3068C7BB0">only pre&s;erve our Rights and Proper|ties, but that He will Govern in this way, and according to the methods of this Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And therefore when a King &s;hall in|vade our Rights and Properties, and wilfully and de&s;ignedly take them from us, and thereby de&s;troy the very End and Rea&s;on of his Authority; or when he will not govern us by Law, nor with the Advice and Con&s;ent of Parliament; he overturns the Society, and di&s;&s;olves the Con&s;titution, the Bond and Union between him and the Society, by which alone he becomes their Head, and they become his People: And if after due ap|plications and proper methods, &s;uch as are pre&s;crib'd before; He per&s;i&s;ts in this Injury without redre&s;s, the People are as much di&s;charg'd from him, as if he had never been their Head; and by Con&s;equence may lawfully con&s;ult their own Welfare in any other Way, that is nece&s;&s;ary to that End, as if that Con&s;ti|tution had never been made. And what|ever they do in &s;uch a ca&s;e, who are then intru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts of the So|ciety, to act in that Juncture for the Welfare of the whole, 'tis the duty of
<PB N="113" REF="014023_0112_0F92ADE3AD5871B8">the whole to &s;ubmit to; becau&s;e they are in that ca&s;e the higher Powers, and indeed for that time the whole Power; which Power is agreed on all hands, 'tis ab&s;olutely unlawful to re&s;i&s;t or di&s;o|bey, either by oppo&s;ing what they have a Right to do, or by refu&s;ing what they have a Right to impo&s;e.</P>
<P>This gives us a Right Notion of Re|volutions in Government, and as it &s;hews us how far Revolutions may be Lawful, &s;o it teaches us how they are to be regularly manag'd, and by what method they ought to be confirm'd, which is not, we &s;ee, by Popular Tu|mults, or by any dome&s;tick Military Force, impo&s;ing &s;uch a change upon us, becau&s;e they have &s;trength enough to do it, but it ought to be done by the whole Society, that is, by the Con&s;ent and Approbation of &s;uch Per&s;ons, with whom the Intere&s;ts of the Society are intru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Indeed, in the Ca&s;e of a Rovolution brought about by the Conque&s;t of a Fo|reign force, where we are put under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the Conquer|or in &s;uch a way, and upon &s;uch Terms as He &s;hall impo&s;e, here no certain Rules
<PB N="114" REF="014023_0113_0F92ADE4AB69D888">can be pre&s;crib'd, as being an extraor|dinary ca&s;e; Only in general it may be &s;aid, that as the only ju&s;t Foundation of &s;ubmitting to Conquerors, is, the nece&s;|&s;ity of it to the Welfare of the Society, &s;o they, who undertake to &s;ettle that Submi&s;&s;ion, ought to get the be&s;t Terms they can for the Society, that is, not only for them&s;elves, but for the Whole, and this ought to be the End of every &s;tep they take in the Settlement of that Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But in the ca&s;e before us, we have &s;uppos'd a Revolution to ari&s;e from the natural di&s;&s;olution of the Con&s;titution, by which, tho' the Society have an In|herent Right, to put them&s;elves under any other Form, and make what alter|ations they think fit, yet it cannot be regularly &s;aid to be done by the Society, unle&s;s it be done by &s;uch Per&s;ons only as are appointed by the Society for that purpo&s;e; by which it may appear to be the Act of the Society, and it cannot be Lawfully done by them, for any other End, or upon any other rea&s;on, than as it is nece&s;&s;ary for the Welfare of the Whole.</P>
<P>And this gives us occa&s;ion to reflect
<PB N="115" REF="014023_0114_0F92ADE549257610">with plea&s;ure, upon the kind Providence of God, in our late Revolution, by which, He not only deliver'd us, and our Po&s;terity, from the apparent ruin of our Liberties and Religion, but al&s;o gave us a happy opportunity, of doing it by the concurrence of the whole Soci|ety, in a regular Convention of Lords and Commons; And by this means, having left no room for rea&s;onable men to object again&s;t the thing, or the man|ner of it, He has provided both for our &s;afety, and our &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>This is a frequent Que&s;tion in the Schools; but 'tis much more &s;o among Politicians, and of fatal con&s;equence to many Societies.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="014023_0115_0F92ADE60947A410">
Among&s;t us in <HI>England,</HI> 'tis a kind of Here&s;y in Politicks, not to give the Pre|ference to Monarchy; And indeed, as Monarchy is the mo&s;t antient and uni|ver&s;al, &s;o one would be apt to conclude it the mo&s;t natural, and therefore the mo&s;t eligible Form:</P>
<P>And of all Forms of Monarchy, the ab&s;olute would probably be be&s;t could we &s;uppo&s;e our Princes would be always wi&s;e and good; could we be always &s;ure of Per&s;ons, who&s;e intire aim would be the Welfare of their People, and who&s;e prudence would always direct them for the be&s;t; and cou'd we be &s;ure, they would be always in wi&s;e and good hands, an ab&s;olute Form of Monarchy would &s;eem be&s;t fitted, to an&s;wer all the occa|&s;ions of the Public.</P>
<P>But con&s;idering the infirmity and cor|ruption of human Nature, it cannot be expected, but that we mu&s;t &s;ometimes fall into the hands of wicked and de|&s;igning Coun&s;ellors: And therefore &s;ince we can never hope, but &s;uch an ab&s;olute Dominion mu&s;t, &s;ome time, or other, degenerate into Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion; this mu&s;t be a fal&s;e Notion of Government, as tending to the de|&s;truction
<PB N="117" REF="014023_0116_0F92ADE86C55F5D8">of the End of Government.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we have already &s;hewn, that Government is only a means to an End, which End is the Welfare of So|ciety, in the &s;ecurity of their Rights and Properties; if Monarchy be the be&s;t Form of Government, That by con&s;e|quence mu&s;t be the be&s;t Form of Mo|narchy, where the Rights and Pro|perties of the Society are be&s;t &s;ecur'd: And as the Rights of any Society are mo&s;t likely to be be&s;t &s;ecur'd, where nothing can be done in relation to their Rights, without the Advice and Con&s;ent of all Parties concern'd, and where every E&s;tate and Condition of Men in the Society have a &s;hare in the di&s;po&s;al of the Affairs of the Society; &s;o that Form of Monarchy mu&s;t by con&s;e|quence be be&s;t which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd up|on this foundation which we call a li|mited mixt Monarchy.</P>
<P>But however perfect and natural a Form of Government Monarchy of any kind may be, yet it can only be &s;aid to be generally be&s;t, but not ab&s;olutely and univer&s;ally &s;o: For if the different Forms of Government aro&s;e, as we have &s;uppos'd, from the different circum|&s;tances
<PB N="118" REF="014023_0117_0F92ADE90D2B8178">and intere&s;t of people, it will follow, That the Goodne&s;s of any Form can only be mea&s;ur'd by the particular circum&s;tances and intere&s;ts of the Peo|ple, that are &s;ubject to it: And as the Intere&s;ts of People vary with their cir|cum&s;tances, &s;o the Forms of Govern|ment may be various, and yet each be be&s;t in its proper Place, and by con&s;e|quence one Form of Government may be be&s;t for this People, another for that: But yet what form would be be&s;t for any particular People, would be a very hard mater to di&s;tingui&s;h nicely, were we now to form a new Society in a wild and uncivilized country.</P>
<P>For to judge of this exactly, it would be nece&s;&s;ary perfectly to under&s;tand the nature and &s;ituation of the place, the temper and circum&s;tances of the people, the manner of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance with them&s;elves, and their relation to, and dependance upon others;</P>
<P>And yet, after all, when we perfectly under&s;tand this, whether there be any particular Form of Government &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of any people, as that they would not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t under any other, 'tis very hard to &s;ay.
<PB N="119" REF="014023_0118_0F92ADE9A0C2B030">Tho' by a long Ob&s;ervation of the United Provinces, Politicians tell us, it is &s;o with them; and that no other Go|vernment but that they live under, could po&s;&s;ibly be maintained among&s;t them; yet as Monarchy &s;eems to be the mo&s;t perfect, and the mo&s;t natural Form, &s;o we may rea&s;onably think, that, gene|rally &s;peaking, that Form of Monar|chy, which is already &s;hewn in its own nature, would be generally be&s;t for any people.</P>
<P>And where they varied from it at a|ny time, as far as can find, it has not ari&s;en from any incon&s;i&s;tency there is in Monarchy, as &s;uch, to the Intere&s;ts of tho&s;e Societies that are otherwi&s;e mo|delled; but only from &s;ome accidental circum&s;tances relating to the then pre|&s;ent time and place, or the pre&s;ent tem|per of the people, when tho&s;e Societies were formed.</P>
<P>And therefore in the fir&s;t Formati|on of a Society, the particular occa&s;i|ons that then offer them&s;elves, &s;eem to be the Rule, and the only Rule for the fir&s;t Formation of the model of their Government. But when a Society is already formed and a model of Govern|ment
<PB N="120" REF="014023_0119_0F92ADEA61D358F8">has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, the only Rule of judging in this ca&s;e, is the welfare of the Society under it; and as the Welfare of the Society does not con&s;i&s;t in the largene&s;s and extent of their Dominions, much le&s;s in the Granduer and flutter of their Princes, but in the enjoyment of their Rights and Properties; &s;o when any Govern|ment has been long continued, and the People live ea&s;ily and comfortably un|der it, and have a pro&s;pect of continu|ing &s;o, and for that rea&s;on may be thought to like it be&s;t, That Govern|ment no doubt is be&s;t for that People:</P>
<P>And if &s;o, then &s;ince the Govern|ment of England is not only a Monar|chy, and &s;uch a kind of Monarchy, as is be&s;t in its &s;elf, as being limited and mixed, where every State and conditi|on of Men in the Society, have a &s;hare in the di&s;po&s;al of their Rights and Properties, but al&s;o &s;uch a Monarchy, as we have lived for many ages ea&s;ily and comfortably under, and have a pro|&s;pect of continuing &s;o for ever; and therefore &s;uch a Monarchy as we uni|ver&s;ally like; it will follow from hence, by an unavoidable con&s;equence, That
<PB N="121" REF="014023_0120_0F92ADEC9B2101E0">this Form of Government is be&s;t for England.</P>
<P>And by con&s;equence it mu&s;t be a &s;tanding Maxim of Engli&s;h Politics, That this Form of Government ought to be maintained; that is, it ought to be maintained, as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed in England; and therefore not only as a Monarchy, or Kingly Government in one Per&s;on; but al&s;o &s;uch a &s;ort of Kingly Government, as is limited and and mix'd where no Laws can be made by the King, but by the concurrence of the People, that is, by the Advice and Con&s;ent of Parliament.</P>
<P>And as this is already prov'd to be the be&s;t Form of Government upon this con&s;ideration, That in it every State and Condition of Men in the Society, have a &s;hare in the di&s;po&s;al of their &s;everal Rights: And as their are different E|&s;tates and Conditions of men among&s;t us, con&s;ider'd either a Clergy, or Laity, hav|ing not only different and di&s;tinct Rights upon this account, but al&s;o as they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd in to Lords, and Commons:</P>
<P>And as the Parliament is made up of all the&s;e, &s;o it &s;hall follow, That if the
<PB N="122" REF="014023_0121_0F92ADECDDFE8B08">Monarchy ought to be maintain'd under the Parliamentary Limitation e&s;tabli|&s;hed in <HI>England;</HI> it ought to be &s;o, as that each of the&s;e different Conditions of Men, con&s;ider'd as Lords and Commons, and Clergy, may enjoy their re&s;pective Parliamentary Rights, and Privileges, &s;o as each to have a &s;hare in the di&s;po&s;al of Affairs.</P>
<P>This is the Con&s;titution of the Mo|narchy of <HI>England,</HI> and therfore what|&s;oever tends to the pre&s;ervation or de|&s;truction of this, in any one of the&s;e &s;everal re&s;pects, is &s;o for pre&s;ervative or de&s;tructive of the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and by con&s;equence ought either to be avoid|ed, or pur&s;ued; or.</P>
<P>If therefore we reflect upon this Con&s;titution of the Monarchy, and what is nece&s;&s;ary to its Pre&s;ervation in its &s;e|veral parts, that is, what is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and pre&s;ervation of the Monarchy it &s;elf, con&s;ider'd as the Go|vernment of a &s;ingle Per&s;on; or, 2dly, What is nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport and pre&s;ervation, con&s;ider'd in conjunction with the Two Hou&s;es of Parliament, that a due ballance between 'em be man|tain'd;
<PB N="123" REF="014023_0122_0F92ADED541E6400">or, 3dly, What is nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;upport and pre&s;ervation, as a Parlia|mentary Monarchy made up of the Three E&s;tates of the Kingdom, under the Influence of their Head; if, I &s;ay, the&s;e things be con&s;ider'd di&s;tinctly, this will give us all the general Maxim of Policy, relating to the Con&s;titution of our Monarchy.</P>
<P>What the&s;e Maxims are, may ea&s;ily be di&s;cover'd by any one of any ob&s;er|vation and experience, and 'twould be u&s;eful to every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject, to have a di&s;tinct and perfect Knowledge of them, but &s;ince the ju&s;t con&s;ideration of that matter would &s;well this Paper be|yond its bounds, and make it le&s;s u&s;eful for my de&s;ign; I think it proper to pro|ceed no farther, till I have more lei&s;ure and convenience.</P>
<P>Thus you have a View of natural Po|litics, relating both to the duty of Go|vernors and Subjects, &s;et forth in a &s;eries of nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable con|&s;equences from evident, and undoubted Principles.</P>
<P>I leave every one to judge, whether it be or not.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="014023_0123_0F92ADEE1B808700">
But as Truth is the nece&s;&s;ary Relati|on, that things bear to one another, as to agreement, or di&s;agreement, when from certain Principles, we are able to form con&s;i&s;tent Schemes of things, as, hanging together in a regular chain, one part nece&s;&s;arily depending on the other, in a natural and ea&s;y connexion, this looks very like a connexion of Truths.</P>
<P>This I take to be the only way of coming to any certainty in the know|ledge of any truth, and this is the method I have here taken, and this I have pur&s;ued with that Indifference, which becomes every one that would not be deceiv'd.</P>
<P>I have had no Regard to intere&s;t, pre|judice, or party, but only to the di&s;co|very of Truth, and as I have not wi&s;h'd to find it, rather on one &s;ide, than an other, &s;o, if I am mi&s;taken, I am not in love with error, but am ready to re|nounce, upon due conviction, whatever &s;hall appear to be &s;o.</P>
<P>But then it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That I take my notions to be nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quences from certain and undoubted
<PB N="125" REF="014023_0124_0F92ADEED9CDBE50">Principles, the only true way to con|vince me of mi&s;take, is to &s;hew me &s;ome error, con&s;equences deduced from, them: For &s;o long as the&s;e are allow'd to be true, and no Law be di&s;cover'd in the&s;e re&s;pects, if Demon&s;tration be argument, my Scheme cannot be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>This, therefore, I leave it with the Reader, and if any one &s;hall think fit to oppo&s;e what I have &s;aid, if he con&s;ider the Subject with the impartiality of a Philo&s;opher, and treat the author with the civility of a Gentlman; I &s;hall be very glad to be better inform'd, and think my&s;elf oblig'd to him if I am Wrong, that he would give him&s;elf the trouble of &s;etting me Right.</P>
