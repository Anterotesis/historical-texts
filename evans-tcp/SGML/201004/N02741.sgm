<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM LXXIV 20.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;The dark Places of the Earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, and I think its generally allow'd by Expo&s;itors, That this P&s;alm treats of the De&s;truction of the Temple, and of Jeru&s;alem, and the People of GOD by the Chaldeans, at the time of the Ba|byloni&s;h Captivity: And that its rather to be look'd upon as a Narrative of &s;omething pa&s;t at the time of compo&s;ing it, than a Prophecy of what was then to come. And for this rea&s;on its matter of Doubt or Quere among them, who that <HI>A&s;aph</HI> &s;hould be, that in the Title of it is mentioned, for its Author, and they &s;eem enclin'd to think it was rather one of the Po&s;terity of that renowned <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> &s;o often mentioned in the Scrip|tures,
<PB N="2" REF="003260_0003_0FEFDA7BAFBD7B38">or &s;ome other Per&s;on of the &s;ame Name, than that <HI>A&s;aph</HI> him&s;elf, who its certain liv'd in <HI>Davids</HI> time before the Building of the Temple, and therefore long before its de&s;truction by the <HI>Chaldeans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT whoever was the Author of it, yet here|in we have the very Solemn and Earne&s;t Appli|cation or Addre&s;s of the Church in Captivity to GOD for Relief or Help, under the De&s;olations, Ruines or Mi&s;eries bro't on them by tho&s;e their Enemies. In doing which &s;he gives us a very Lively and Pathetical de&s;cription of tho&s;e De&s;o|lations or Ruines, &s;peaks particularly of the Fury and Rage of tho&s;e their Enemies in the Places of their Wor&s;hip; of their De&s;acing the Curious, Carved works of the Temple, and their burning of it, together with their Synagogues; as al&s;o of diver&s;e other Marks or Tokens of Divine di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t them, Arguing or Di&s;covering the dark and difficult Circum&s;tances they were then under, as may be more particularly &s;een by a pe|ru&s;al of the P&s;alm.</P>
<P>AFTER which, with &s;ome other things, for a Clo&s;e of this her Addre&s;s to GOD on this Oc|ca&s;ion, &s;he humbly implores his Favour in the following particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> That he would not utterly give them up to their Enemies; That he would remember his Covenant with their Fore|fathers; That he would plead his own Cau&s;e; And finally, That he would remember &amp; puni&s;h their Enemies for all their reproachful Language</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003260_0004_0FF02E2B745CD8A0">
THE Ver&s;e of my Text contains the Second Article or Thing here prayed for, <HI>viz.</HI> That GOD wou'd remember or have re&s;pect to the Covenant with their Fore-fathers, together with an Argu|ment to enforce it <HI>Have re&s;pect unto the Covenant; for the dark places of the Earth are full of the habita|tions of Cruelty</HI> Have re&s;pect unto the Cove|nant&mdash;. <HI>i. e.</HI> the Covenant made with Abraham, I&s;aac &amp; Jacob, by which thou did&s;t give the Land of Canaan to them &amp; their Seed for ever. This phra&s;e al&s;o may relate to &s;uch Promi&s;es made by GOD to their Fathers, whereby he did a&s;&s;ure them, that if at any time they were carried Cap|tive into &s;trange Lands, and did there humble them&s;elves, and pray and turn to him, that he would me reifully re&s;tore them. See <HI>Lev.</HI> 26 <HI>lat|ter end.</HI> And its <HI>q. d.</HI> Do thou now remember and have re&s;pect to the&s;e things, and re&s;tore us again to that plea&s;ant and light&s;ome Land which thou ha&s;t given to us.</P>
<P>THIS is what the Church here prays for, and the Argument to enforce this Plea we have in the words of my Text, <HI>For the dark Places of the Earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty.</HI> In which &s;imply Con&s;idered I may Ob&s;erve to you two Things, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) THE Subject or thing &s;poken of, <HI>viz.</HI> The dark places of the Earth: In one of which they were now Captives, &amp; where Ignorance, Confu&s;ion and all the works of Darkne&s;s did abound. By which Places its evident (from the tacit Oppo&s;i|tion there is in the words between them and that
<PB N="4" REF="003260_0005_0FEFDA8830EA8D70">Land of light to which &s;he prays to be re&s;tored) mu&s;t be intended &s;uch Places of the Earth, as were not Enlightened by Divine Revelation, as the Land from which they were carried Captive was: Such Places as on which that Day-&s;pring from on high had not ri&s;en, or vi&s;ited; which GOD had not taken into the Relation of an Ex|ternal Covenant, and were not favour'd with the Priviledges and Ble&s;&s;ings of it; which then was the Condition of far the greate&s;t part of the World, as well as at this day.</P>
<P N="2">(2) WE have in the words &s;omething a&s;|&s;erted of them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were full of the Habitations of Cruelty. Hereby intimating how mi&s;erable the Condition of tho&s;e Places, or of &s;uch as were in them, was, <HI>q. d.</HI> The&s;e Places of the Earth are full of Murders, Blood&s;heds. Violence, Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Tyranny, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The very law of Nature is almo&s;t utterly Obliterated in the hearts of men, and there is little to be &s;een even of the things which that teaches and re|quires of them. This is the Character the Cap|tive Church gives of tho&s;e Places of the Earth in that day or time, and very agreeable it is to the Character the Apo&s;tle (<HI>Rom.</HI> 1) gives of the Gentile World in his time, and may now in our Day be given of it. And it &s;ugge&s;ts to us this truth for our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration and Im|provement. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>Doct. <HI>THAT reveal'd Religion is the great means to Pre&s;erve, Cultivate or Improve Natural Re|ligion in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003260_0006_0FF02E2D453D4B18">
THIS is a natural and ea&s;y deduction from the Character the Church here gives of &s;uch Places of the Earth, as GOD in Sovereignty had left to the In&s;truction and Guidance of the un|written Law of Nature only, and had not favour'd with the Ble&s;&s;ing of reveal'd Religion, or his written Word.</P>
<P>AND in &s;peaking to this Truth, I &s;hall e&s;&s;ay the&s;e three things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>TO &s;hew what is intended, or we are to under|&s;tand by Natural Religion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>WHAT we are to under&s;tand by Reveal'd Religion.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>TO Evidence what is here a&s;&s;erted,</HI> viz. <HI>That the Latter is the great means to Pre&s;erve, Cul|tivate or Improve the Former.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> WITH Relation to the fir&s;t Thing, viz. <HI>Natural Religion.</HI> You may take this &s;hort De|finition of it, viz. <HI>That it is that Faith and Ob&s;er|vance or Obedience which Nature, or Natural Light teaches men.</HI> By Nature here I would not be un|der&s;tood to intend &s;imple, unin&s;tructed Nature, but Nature or Natural light under its utmo&s;t improvement by Contemplation or Study of the works of GOD in Creation and Providence, tho&s;e common di&s;coveries he makes of him&s;elf and will to all mankind. That Faith and Ob&s;ervance or Obedience, which Nature thus in&s;tructed or im|proved teaches any, is what I here intend by Natural Religion. Natural Religion, as well as that which in Reveal'd, objectively taken, con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="6" REF="003260_0007_0FEFDA89EBD54488">of its <HI>Credenda &amp; Agenda,</HI> i e. Of things to be be|liev'd and things to be done, and by Con&s;equence, &s;ubjectively taken, includes in it Faith and Ob|&s;ervance, or Obedience as well as the other; and indeed a con&s;iderable part (yea, may I not &s;ay, the main part) of the Faith and Obedience of Re|veal'd Religion (largely taken) is Primarily and Really no other than the Faith and Obedience of Natural Religion.</P>
<P>More Particularly here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NATURAL Religion includes Faith in it.</HI> There are &s;undry Doctrinals, or Articles of Faith, yea and of the Chri&s;tian Faith too, largely ta|ken, which Nature teaches the belief of, this in Particular, is the Ca&s;e with &s;undry of its Do|ctrines relating both to GOD and Our&s;elves Chri&s;tianity or Reveal'd Religion contains a Do|ctrine concerning GOD, a Doctrine including in it many things to be believ'd concerning him. But how many of them, are no other than what Nature teaches the belief of, and which we &s;hould or might have believed, had we never been a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by Supernatural Revelation, or been left to the only In&s;truction of Natural light, em|ploy'd in the &s;tudy of that common di&s;covery GOD makes of him&s;elf, in his works to all Man|kind? This is the Ca&s;e not only with his Ex|i&s;tence, or Being, but al&s;o diver&s;e of his Per|fections or Attributes, &s;uch as his Eternity, Uni|ty, Omnipotence, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Perfections are &s;o Legible in his works, that he that could not have &s;een them there, or &s;ome of
<PB N="7" REF="003260_0008_0FF02E30775DCC30">them at lea&s;t (had he not otherwi&s;e Reveal'd them) might have ju&s;tly been pronounc'd Blind and Stupid, even to the degree of brutal Crea|tures them&s;elves. Con&s;onant to this the A|po&s;tle (<HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.) tells us of the&s;e invi&s;ible things of GOD, that they are clearly &s;een, and to be under&s;tood by the things that are made, without the help of Supernatural Revelation; and accordingly were &s;een, under&s;tood and be|liev'd by many in the Gentile World, as is evi|dent from what we have of theirs in our hands.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with &s;undry Doctrines, or Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith, relating to Our&s;elves: In Particular tho&s;e Great and Funda|mental Articles of it. <HI>viz.</HI> The Immortality of the Soul, and the reality of Reward, or Puni&s;h|ment in the Future Life, according as men demean them&s;elves in this. The&s;e al&s;o are Doctrines which the Gentiles that had only the unwritten Law of Nature, did believe, &amp; have taught us. <HI>Ci|cero</HI> &s;peaking of them, tells us they were Doctrines handed down to his time, from all Antiquity. And hence as on the one hand, we find in their writings an <HI>Eli&s;ium</HI> or Paradi&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> A Place of plea&s;ant and delightful Fields and Walks, (as they conceiv'd of it) into which they believ'd the Souls of ju&s;t men went after their departure hence; &s;o on the other a <HI>Tartarus,</HI> which they believ'd to be as one &s;ays, <HI>Career Paenarum infer|num,</HI> i. e. A Place or Pri&s;on, where the Souls of the Wicked are Coufin'd and Puni&s;hed in the Future Life.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="003260_0009_0FEFDA8C21604408">
2. IT Con&s;i&s;ts of or includes Ob&s;ervance or Obedience in it: or there is an Ob&s;ervance or Obedience which Nature teaches. Of this we are a&s;&s;ured by the Apo&s;tle Paul, as well as other|wi&s;e, when he tells us of the Gentiles, Rom. 2. 14 <HI>That tho' they had not the written Law, yet did by Nature the things Contained in the Law.</HI> Tho' many among them holding the Truth in un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, did not do tho&s;e things, but liv'd in a &s;inful Neglect of them, or at lea&s;t many of them, as he &s;hews us <HI>chap.</HI> 1. Yet with others the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e, they &s;hewed the work of the Law written in their hearts, by ob&s;erving or do|ing the Main, Sub&s;tantial parts of the Obedience required in it, at lea&s;t as to the matter of it.</P>
<P>MORE Particularly here, That Ob&s;ervance or Obedience included in Natural Religion, or which the light of Nature teaches, relates either to GOD, Our&s;elves, or our Fellow-Creatures. With relation to GOD it teaches that fir&s;t and great, and Comprehen&s;ive Duty of the Law, <HI>viz.</HI> The love of GOD, to love him with all the Heart, Soul and Strength. It teaches the Fear of GOD; to hope and tru&s;t in him, to Pray to him, and be thankful for his Mercies. Hence we find the neglect of the&s;e things in tho&s;e Gentiles &s;poken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. mentioned as the Rea&s;on why the wrath of GOD came upon them <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>Becau&s;e that when they knew GOD, they did not</HI> in, or by the&s;e things <HI>Glorify him as GOD.</HI> With relation to Our&s;elves, it teaches the duty of Self-love, to|gether with &s;uch Vertues as are the Natural Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="9" REF="003260_0010_0FF02E35CA22C5B8">of it. And with relation to Others, the Relative Duties falling under that Ju&s;tice and Charity that are the &s;um of the Second Table. In which things, be it &s;poken to the &s;hame of us Chri&s;tians, many in the Gentile World have much excell'd or gone beyond the mo&s;t of us. That the&s;e things are but &s;everal parts of that Ob&s;ervance or Obedience which Nature teaches, is evident from that inward Te&s;timony of Con|&s;cience, either Approving and Ju&s;tifying, or Con|demning, the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us &s;uch of the Gen|tiles, at lea&s;t as were not of depraved Minds and Con&s;ciences had Experience of, according as they either did or neglected them. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that many things are to be met with in the writings of divers Heathen, Repugnant to what I have now mentioned, as the Religion of Nature, as might he ea&s;ily &s;hewn: But this no more proves it not to be &s;o, than that there were in the Gentile World, none who&s;e Minds and Con&s;ciences were Deprav'd and Vitia|ted. And from this &s;hort Account now given of it, 'tis evident that Reveal'd Religion or Chri&s;tiani|ty, as we commonly call it, taken in its full Ex|tent or Latitude, is as to the Main, Sub&s;tantial Parts of it, no other than Natural Religion, as will more fully appear by the Account I &s;hall give of it, which is the Second Thing propo&s;ed, and I now come to.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> AS for Reveal'd Religion, you may take this Account of it, viz, <HI>That it is that Faith and
<PB N="10" REF="003260_0011_0FEFDA8E937FC2A0">Ob&s;ervance which is taught in the Scriptures or word of GOD.</HI> This is a Revelation &s;uperadded to the light of Nature, and as Natural Religion is that Faith and Ob&s;ervance which Nature teaches, &s;o Reveal'd Religion is that Faith and Ob&s;ervance, which is taught and recommended to us by this Divine, Supernatural Revelation. From whence its evident to every one that knows what the Faith and Ob&s;ervance taught us in the Scriptures is, that Reveal'd Religion, or Chri&s;tianity, as we commonly call it, is not a thing altogether differ|ent from Natural Religion, but Contrarily that its very much one, and the &s;ame thing, as I but now hinted: As to a main Part of it, no other than Natural Religion re-inforced, and improv'd by Divine Revelation. But yet, tho' this be the Ca&s;e with many things in it, yet not with the whole; things of this Nature are not the whole of what is intended by Reveal'd Religion; but be|&s;ides them, there are included in it matters both of Faith and Practice, which Nature makes no di&s;covery of. Nature tho' it teach many Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith, yet not all. Tho' it teach the Exi&s;tence or Being of GOD, yet not the man|ner of his Sub&s;i&s;tence, or that he is Three in One, and One in Three. Tho' it make &s;ome di&s;covery of Sin to Men, yet as it gives no intimation of the true Origine of it, &s;o neither of the way of Redemption, or delivery from it. The whole Doctrine of the Go&s;pel relating to this my&s;tery of Godline&s;s, (I mean the Way or Means of our Redemption from Sin and Wrath) is wholly Su|pernatural,
<PB N="11" REF="003260_0012_0FF02E37A2252A48">and Nature gives no intimations of it. The Determination or Appointment of this way of our Redemption, was one of GODs Preroga|tive, Sovereign Acts, the effect of his Sovereign Will and Plea&s;ure, and what has no Connexion with any thing in Nature, and what therefore can't be deduc'd or argued from it. Con&s;onant to this we find nothing of the&s;e things in the Theology of the Heathen. And the like may be &s;aid concerming the Re&s;urrection of our Bodies at la&s;t, and their Re-union with our Souls; &amp; many other Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith, concerning which its equally &s;ilent.</P>
<P>AND the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with diver&s;e things of a practical Nature, included within the compa&s;s of Reveal'd Religion; they are things which Na|ture after its be&s;t and utmo&s;t Improvements is wholly a Stranger to. Of this Nature is the Duty of Believing in CHRIST for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life, the Duty of offering up all our Prayers and Services to GOD in his Name, with a rely|ance on his Mediation for the Acceptance of them.</P>
<P>THESE are Duties purely Evangelical, beyond the utmo&s;t Efforts of Nature to make any di&s;co|very of, and of which therefore we mu&s;t have for ever remain'd Ignorant, had not Supernatu|ral Revelation made them known to us. And the &s;ame I may &s;ay concerning the Duty of Sanctifying the Lord's Day, together with the Rituals of Po&s;itives of that In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip, an Attendance on which GOD has made a main
<PB N="12" REF="003260_0013_0FEFDB0DC97AF8B0">part of it. Nature makes no di&s;covery of the&s;e things. However the&s;e and &s;uch like things, together with tho&s;e mentioned under the former Head, are what is here intended by Reveal'd Religion.</P>
<P N="3">III. I come to &s;hew <HI>that Reveal'd Religion is the great means to Pre&s;erve, Cultivate or Improve Natural Religion in the World.</HI> And it might Suffice for Evidence of this, only to &s;ay, That this is the Mean which the Infinitely Wi&s;e GOD in all Ages has made u&s;e of for this End. Revealed Religion, as it has ever been One and the &s;ame in all the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of it, &s;o has there not been any Age or Day &s;ince there was a Church on Earth, in which it was without it, tho' the way of Communicating of it in different Ages has been Various. GOD Spake or Communi|cated this Rule the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.1. in diver&s;e manners to the Fathers, yet the Thing Spoken or Communicated was Ever, in all the E&s;&s;entials of it, One and the &s;ame, exactly a|greeing to the one and only Archetype or Idea of Divinity that Eternally was in the Divine Mind.</P>
<P>BUT for a more full Illu&s;tration of it, I &s;hall Endeavour to make Good the&s;e Two Propo&s;iti|ons, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>THAT there is nothing in Revealed Religion that can any way Hurt, Prejudice or Hinder that which is Natural.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>THAT it is every way Calculated, Adap|ted or Suited to the Pre&s;ervation and Furtherance or Improvement of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003260_0014_0FF02E39640B0530">
Prop. I. <HI>THERE is nothing in Revealed Religion that can any way Hurt, Prejudice or Hinder Natural Religion.</HI> Were there any thing of this Nature in it, this as it would be a ju&s;t Exception again&s;t it, &s;o what at once would Overthrow what I am now in the proof of. There is no Oppo&s;ition or Incon&s;i&s;tency in any, either of the Doctrines or Precepts of the Word of GOD with tho&s;e which Nature Teaches. Supernatural Revelation does not in any thing contradict right rea&s;on; for any &s;o to a&s;&s;ert were to make the Mo&s;t High Incon|&s;i&s;tent with Him&s;elf. Revealed Religion, or the Word of GOD, contains, indeed, Doctrines and Precepts diver&s;e from tho&s;e which Nature teaches, (and which Surpa&s;s its Comprehen&s;ion) but not Oppo&s;ite to them, nor &s;uch as can in any wi&s;e hinder us in our Belief and Ob&s;ervance of them. Tho' it tells us that GOD is One in a manner to us Inconceivable, yet, that he is but One &s;till; One Simple, Undivided E&s;&s;ence. Nor does it teach us any thing concerning Him tending or leading us to think or believe otherwi&s;e of him, to conceive of him as One not clothed with tho&s;e Perfections, which Natural light or rea&s;on Contemplating his Works a&s;&s;ures us he is clothed with: But contrarily what Perfections righ. Rea&s;on contemplating him in the Gla&s;s of his Creatures and Works, &s;ees to be in him, the &s;ame does Revealed Religion, or Word of GOD, a&s;cribe or give to him, that &s;ame Eternity, In&s;inity, Wi&s;|dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, that are &s;o Legible in his Works to all Wi&s;e ob&s;ervers of them.
<PB N="14" REF="003260_0015_0FEFDB90A3046E88">In like manner, Tho&s;e other Doctrines of Re|veal'd Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> The Incarnation of the Se|cond Per&s;on, in the affair of our Redemption, and the future Re&s;urrection of the Body, though they contain things inexplicable by us, and which &s;ur|pa&s;s our Conception; yet as none can &s;ay there is any incon&s;i&s;tency in them with any article of Faith which Nature teaches, &s;o all tho&s;e that are wi&s;e will &s;ay there is not more of My&s;tery in them neither than in diver&s;e of the other.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame as to things of a Practical Nature in Natural Religion: No Doctrine of the Word of God is of that Nature, as that it can have any ill influence on them, or any way prejudice them. Tho&s;e purely Evangelical Doctrines of it that open to us the way to Pardon and Life, tho' they are, as was before ob&s;erved, what Natural Religion is utterly a &s;tranger to (and direct us to &s;eek tho&s;e things in a way, or by means different from what that does) yet cannot in the lea&s;t pre|judice or hinder us in any Duty it directs us to for the &s;ame end; and that becau&s;e there is no Duty required by it for this end, the nece&s;&s;ity of which for the &s;ame is not taught in tho&s;e Doctrines of the Go&s;pel. It were ea&s;y to &s;hew this in a detail of the particulars on both &s;ides, but its needle&s;s, &s;ince the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us of it, when he &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 31. of the&s;e Doctrines of Faith I am now &s;peaking of, That they <HI>do not make void that Law</HI> that is the &s;um of Natural Religion, but on the other hand <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h it.</HI> In a word, What I have &s;aid of the Doctrines of Revoal'd Religion,
<PB N="15" REF="003260_0016_0FF02E3DCD15B370">may with equal truth be &s;aid of its Precepts or Duties; there is no incon&s;i&s;tency in them, with any Precept or Duty of Natural Religion, or any thing of a tendency to prejudice our due Ob&s;er|vance of them.</P>
<P>Prop II. <HI>IT's every way Calculated, Adapted or Suited to the pre&s;ervation &amp; furtherance or improve|ment of it.</HI> This will be evident when the&s;e four things are con&s;idered, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>THAT it contains all the Truths of Natural Religion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>THAT it Illu&s;trates, Explains &amp; Improves them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>THAT it Corrects all the Errors &amp; Corruptions that with or among any have Crept into it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>THAT it improves its Motives &amp; adds to them.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> or the Word of God, <HI>con|tains &amp; re-inforces all the Truths of Natural Religion.</HI> So far is it from having any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with any of them, that it contains them all, and re-inforces them, be they of a Doctrinal or Practi|cal nature. I have already ob&s;erved that Chri&s;ti|anity or Revealed Religion, taken in its full Ex|tent, is as to a main part of it no other than Na|tural Religion, the Religion which <HI>Nature</HI> teaches adopted by the Go&s;pel and made a part of it &s;elf. And this we may &s;ay of the whole of <HI>Natural Re|ligion,</HI> all its Doctrines &amp; Precepts, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> has adopted them all, and accordingly teaches them, and urges a Faith and Ob&s;ervance of them as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in every Chri&s;tian. And this Con&s;idera|tion
<PB N="16" REF="003260_0017_0FF02DFBAA4C1830">(by the way) as its an Evidence of the &s;uita|blene&s;s of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> for the Ends to which its here &s;aid to be proper, &amp; be&s;peaks the peculiar Excellency of it (&s;ince the &s;ame can't be &s;aid of, perhaps, any other Religion in the world) &s;o is it all the &s;ame time a &s;trong proof of its Divine Ori|ginal. Nor need we any further Evidence of the Fal&s;ene&s;s of any pretences the <HI>Alcoran</HI> of that grand Impo&s;tor <HI>(Mahomet)</HI> makes to this than its teaching things Repugnant to the &s;incere &amp; pure dictates of Nature: Hereby it a&s;&s;ures us it never came from Heaven. No In&s;titution of this &s;ort can do &s;o; for GOD is the Father of Natural Light, as well as that which is Supernatural, and he cannot contradict him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT otherwi&s;e it is with that Religion of which I am now &s;peaking: There is no truth of a Doctrinal nature, be it concerning GOD or our|&s;elves, contain'd in Natural Religion, which this does not contain &amp; teach too, nor any Duty that Enjoins, which this does not Enjoin too. Does that teach the Being of GOD, the Unity of his E&s;&s;ence, this does &s;o too. <HI>There is one God,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 5. <HI>i. e.</HI> there is but one. Does that teach his Eternity, or Exi&s;tence before all time &amp; things, this does &s;o too. That he <HI>is the King Eternal,</HI> 1. Tim. 1.17. <HI>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou had&s;t for med the Earth &amp; the World, even from Everla&s;ting, to Everla&s;ting thou art God,</HI> P&s;al. 90.2. Does that teach his Om|nipotence, this does the &s;ame. <HI>Ell &amp; Shaddai, i. e.</HI> the &s;trong God, and God al&s;ufficient, are Names
<PB N="17" REF="003260_0018_0FF02E41F3B5ABC0">by which he reveals him&s;elf in his Word. And &s;o as to his Mercy, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame is true of all the Doctrines of Natural Re|ligion, re&s;pecting our&s;elves, and all its Rules for conduct or practice. Here we have the mo&s;t re|fined Sy&s;tem of <HI>Ethicks</HI> or <HI>Morals:</HI> That Sobriety, Temperance, Charity, Ju&s;tice, Charity, Humility, Fortitude, Patience, Meekne&s;s, and whatever el&s;e of this nature, <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> either by the re|mains of the mo&s;t Polite Heathen, or otherwi&s;e, has recommended and urged, is here taught and urged likewi&s;e. It de&s;cends to particulars, and con&s;idering us either alone, or as joined together in Society, or as under the various circum&s;tances of humane Life, or as di&s;po&s;ed of into any of tho&s;e Relations or Places wherein by Providence we are made at any time, while here, to &s;tand; And whatever Vertues or Duties in any of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances or relations, Natural Religion recom|mends &amp; enjoins, the &s;ame does it enjoin likewi&s;e. Now it being thus with Reveal'd Religion, it can't be otherwi&s;e than proper for the ends mention'd, ina&s;much as its hence evident that by it Natural Religion, in all the parts of it is recommended to us with an additional &s;tamp or impre&s;s of Divine Authority upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT Illu&s;trates &amp; Improves them.</HI> The truths of Natural Religion are by it delivered to us with an illu&s;tration &amp; improvement beyond what the light of Nature in any, or the Pagan Theology were ever capable of. This will be very evident on a brief review of &s;ome of them. And I'll in|&s;tance
<PB N="18" REF="003260_0019_0FF02DFD655C9340">here in its Doctrine concerning the Divine Perfections of God. Every one mu&s;t confe&s;s that the truths of Natural Religion falling under this head, are much illu&s;trated and improved in the Sacred Pages of Reveal'd Religion, when we have them all not only a&s;&s;erted there, but tho&s;e Per|fections they a&s;cribe or give to God repre&s;ented or &s;et before us as tran&s;acting or doing many won|derful works in Providence; Works in the per|formance of which the mo&s;t High publi&s;hed his Prai&s;e, got to him&s;elf a Name, &amp; became dread|ful even among the heathen, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.14.</P>
<P>NOT to mention others of his wonderful works recorded in his Word, with what an illu&s;tra|tion do the truths of Natural Religion concern|ing the Wi&s;dom, Power, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> appear, when we there view tho&s;e Per|fections tran&s;acting, <HI>i. e.</HI> contriving &amp; accompli&s;h|ing the glorious de&s;ign of mans Redemption? This was the re&s;ult of nothing le&s;s than an infi|nite Wi&s;dom &amp; Goodne&s;s, &amp; an affair in contri|ving &amp; accompli&s;hing which, as there was a con|currence of the&s;e &amp; other Perfects, &s;o in nothing do they appear &s;o glorious as in this; nor are we by any thing el&s;e &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming ju&s;t conceptions of them. In this affair we have, if I may &s;o &s;peak, the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of the Divine Wi&s;dom &amp; Power: Here the far di&s;tant terms of Infinite &amp; Finite, Eternal &amp; Temporal are bro't together; GOD is made to become Man, the E|ternal Temporal, Life to Die, and by Dying to give Life to the World; <HI>And without Controver&s;y,
<PB N="19" REF="003260_0020_0FF02E44E7C90B18">GREAT is this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s.</HI> Nor is this the only way by which Reveal'd Religion illu&s;trates and Improves the&s;e truths of Natural Religion, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts our Conceptions of the&s;e things, as it were ea&s;y to &s;hew.</P>
<P>I may in&s;tance again in the Doctrines or Truths of Natural Religion relating to the Soul, <HI>its Im|mortality &amp; a Future State.</HI> This I mention'd be|fore as one thing intimated or taught by the light of Nature, and accordingly find Intimations of it in the writings of the Heathen. But with how much ob&s;curity and darkne&s;s are the Truths of this Nature attended, as they are delivered to us by them! And into how much a clearer Light are they brought by the Doctrines of Reveal'd Religion! The Apo&s;tle tells us, 2 Tim. 1, 10. <HI>That Life &amp; Immortality are brought to light by the Go&s;pel i. e.</HI> The Future State of Immortality, &amp; the Good &amp; Evil things of it, or what the Con|dition of Souls there is. And certain 'tis, that by the Go&s;pel tho&s;e things are bro't into a much clearer Light than ever they were before, by the Doctrines of the wi&s;e&s;t Heathen concerning them, or can be by any E&s;&s;ays of meer Natural Light or Rea&s;on in any, tho' never &s;o much improved. This is true whether we &s;peak with reference to the certainty of the Thing, or the Condition of Souls there, the Good and Evil things of that Life or State.</P>
<P>CONSONANT to what is now &s;aid; with re|lation to the Reality or Certainty of the thing, it is ob&s;ervable that tho' the Heathen have gene|rally
<PB N="20" REF="003260_0021_0FF02E0034B076E0">in all Ages agreed in di&s;covering &s;uch No|tices of it, &amp; &s;uch degrees of Faith re&s;pecting it, as will bear me out in Ranking it among the Ar|ticles of Faith delivered by them to us, yet as &s;ome of them (and they of the Wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t Learned among them too) have deny'd it, &s;o o|thers have &s;poken of it with much of doub|ting &amp; he&s;itancy. Thus, for in&s;tance, the learned <HI>Cicero,</HI> &s;peaking of the hope of good men in the future life, calls it, <HI>Futurorum quoddam augurium &s;aeculorum, i. e.</HI> A &s;urmi&s;e or dream of future ages. And el&s;ewhere having cited the different Sen|timents of the Philo&s;ophers about it, he concludes thus, <HI>Which of the&s;e Opinions is true, &s;ome God mu&s;t tell us; which is mo&s;t like to truth, is a great Que&s;tion.</HI> And <HI>Socrates</HI> too even at the time of his death, &s;pake of the good things of that life or &s;tate, not without &s;u&s;picion or doubt about the reality of them. <HI>I hope,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to go from hence to Good Men, but of that I am not very Confident: Nor doth it be|come any wi&s;e man to be Po&s;itive that &s;o it will be. I,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>mu&s;t now die, and you &s;hall live; but which of us is in the better State, the living or the dead, God only knows.</HI> Nor is it &s;trange they &s;hould do &s;o, &s;ince Natural Light after its utmo&s;t improvement could not furni&s;h them, (nor indeed can it any Man) with tho&s;e Mediums to bring this matter into that light &amp; certainty that Revcal'd Re|ligion furni&s;hes us withal.</P>
<P>IN like manner, as to the Nature of that State, the Good &amp; Evil things of it, or the Condition of Souls there, they were much in the Dark, &amp;
<PB N="21" REF="003260_0022_0FF02E473264D930">&s;peak with great Ob&s;curity. What in particular the Felicity of Good Men there is, they tell us not; and as to the Evils or Puni&s;hment of the Wicked there, the Dreams of their Poets of <HI>A Styx</HI> and <HI>Tartarus,</HI> are the only Accounts they give us of it.</P>
<P>BUT now Reveal'd Religion has Illu&s;trated and Improved the&s;e Di&s;coveries of the Pagan Theology, bro't the&s;e things out of their Ob|&s;curity, and &s;et them in a clearer light.</P>
<P>IN a word, What I have &s;aid of the&s;e Doctri|nal truths of Natural Religion, is equally true of &s;uch as are Practical; they are by Reveal'd Re|ligion &s;et in a much clearer light; greatly illu&s;tra|ted, explained &amp; improved, beyond what they are in the Morals of the mo&s;t Polite Heathen: As it were ea&s;ie to &s;hew in many particulars of them. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IT corrects all the Errors and Corruptions that with or among any have at any time crept into and mingled them&s;elves with it.</HI> Natural Religion con|&s;idered under its Various Forms &amp; Adulterations in the Gentile world, though it retain'd &s;ome &s;trictures of Truth, yet was &s;o blended with Error &amp; Corruption, as to render it not only mo&s;t di&s;ho|nourable to GOD, but prejudicial to the Vertue &amp; Felicity of Mankind. As in Doctrine it con|tain'd many things mo&s;t ab&s;urd &amp; repugnant to the Faith of Reveal'd Religion, &s;o in Practi&s;e as many, to the holy Rules or Precepts of it. I might not &s;tay here, were I able, to give a Reci|tal of them; (and indeed Nature recoyls at the
<PB N="22" REF="003260_0023_0FF02E01D498B098">thought of it) but mu&s;t only &s;ay in &s;hort, That as we have a Specimen of them, (<HI>Rom</HI> 1. <HI>latter end,</HI>) So &s;uch a Medley of Error &amp; Corruption was it, that as many of the wi&s;er among them&s;elves were a&s;hamed of it, &s;o the only Eva&s;ion tho&s;e Philo&s;o|phers had, who undertook the defence of it again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, was to expound it by Allegories Nor is it &s;trange it &s;hould be &s;o, when its con&s;ider'd on the one hand, what degeneracy &amp; folly Mi&s;erable man is capable of, and on the other, that it had no better Light or Guide than deprav'd Rea&s;on in fallen man, and that tho&s;e who were the Authors or Inventors of it, were Either men of de&s;ign, who E&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in their Power &amp; Authority by it, as <HI>Numa;</HI> Or men of Vice, Fancy &amp; Fiction, as the Poets.</P>
<P>BUT as for all &s;uch things whereby it was a|dulterated, corrupted and di&s;gui&s;ed in any part of the Gentile World, they are corrected, their folly and impiety expo&s;ed, and its truths Re&s;cued from all impure Mixtures by the better light of re|vealed Religion.</P>
<P>Finally,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>IT improves the Motives of Natural Religion and adds to them.</HI> Natural Religion has its Motives as well as Reveal'd. That Religion that Sugge&s;ts to us the being of God, with many of his perfecti|ons, our Relation to him, dependance on him, and that all we have is from him; and not only &s;o, but at the &s;ame time (as we have &s;een) di&s;covers to us a future life or &s;tate of reward or puni&s;hment of things done in this: This light I &s;ay that di&s;covers
<PB N="23" REF="003260_0024_0FF02E48DAC9A2B0">the&s;e things to us, as it can't but at the &s;ame time di&s;cover much of the Duty lying on us, &s;o al&s;o pre&s;ent us with &s;o many moral Rea&s;ons or Argu|ments, &s;trong &amp; powerful, to a careful di&s;charge of it. Accordingly we find that even in the Gen|tile world it &s;elf, under all its Deprevations or Corruptions there, it was never wholly without them: Nor could it be as long as any &s;trictures of tho&s;e truths were retained by it. But now how much are tho&s;e moral Rea&s;ons or Arguments im|proved by the better di&s;coveries of Reveal'd Re|ligion! In or by this we have the Being of God, His Perfections, our Relation to him, Dependance on him, his tender Compa&s;&s;ions towards us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;et before us in another light than Natural Re|ligion was ever capable of, and by Con&s;equence the moral Rea&s;ons of Obedience pre&s;ented to us, with an additional Force or Strength.</P>
<P>I need not illu&s;trate what I now &s;ay, it be|ing known to every one not a &s;tranger to it. Nor is this all it does of this Nature or Tendency, but over and above the&s;e motives, it &s;ugge&s;ts or adds others of its own: Con&s;iderations or Argu|ments ari&s;ing from other Heads or Topicks, which Natural Religion is wholly a &s;tranger to, as every one al&s;o mu&s;t know that is in any mea&s;ure ac|quainted with it.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e things being &s;o, it mu&s;t needs be that Reveal'd Religion is an excellent means to Pre&s;erve, Cultivate, or Improve that which is Natural; or that its every way well adapted or preportioned to this good de&s;ign or end. That
<PB N="24" REF="003260_0025_0FF02E081FDE2848">which Reveals and Reinforces all the truths of Natural Religion, that illu&s;trates and improves them, that re&s;cues them from all impure Mix|tures, that improves all its Motives and adds to them, mu&s;t needs be &s;o.</P>
<P>TO all which I may now add this one Con&s;i|deration further, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Publick In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of the Go&s;pel or Reveal'd Religion, is as to the main parts of it, materially Con&s;ider'd, no other than the wor&s;hip of Natural Religion: That wor&s;hip of GOD which Natural Light or Con&s;cience teaches all men. This is true of the whole, tho&s;e Rituals or Po&s;itives of it (Bapti&s;m and the Lords Supper) only excepted. As for the re&s;t, its no other than &s;everal Acts of Natural Religion or Wor&s;hip, under that Re&s;triction of certain po&s;itive Laws, determining the time and manner of performance, which is but nece&s;&s;ary to the orderly and due Performance of them.</P>
<P>EVERY one will &s;ee this that does but turn back to the account before given of Natural Re|ligion, and at the &s;ame time con&s;iders what this In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip I am now &s;peaking of is, as to the main parts of it.</P>
<P>AND agreeable to it, that great light of the Church, Dr. AMES thus defines it, viz. <HI>That it is a Medium Ordained by GOD for the Exerci&s;e &amp; Im|provement of Natural Religion or Wor&s;hip.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Ame&s;ii</HI> Medul. Theolog. pag. 287.</NOTE> I men|tion this in this place, not only for further illu&s;|tration of this Argument, but as what I think
<PB N="25" REF="003260_0026_0FF02E4FDF7705F0">is proper for and de&s;erves the particular Con&s;ide|ration of all, and more e&s;pecially &s;uch as are Ene|mies, or but too indifferently affected toward the Publick In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of the Go&s;pel, and many ways expre&s;s that its a thing of little E&s;teem or Price with them.</P>
<P>AND I would on this occa&s;ion entreat &s;uch to Con&s;ider how unable they are to excu&s;e them|&s;elves in the&s;e things. Sirs, What Apology can you make for your &s;elves? What, does not Con|&s;cience tell you the truth of what is now a&s;&s;erted, that this wor&s;hip you thus Slight, De&s;pi&s;e and Neglect, as to all the main parts of it, materially Con&s;idered, is no other than Natural Wor&s;hip, that Wor&s;hip which Nature tells you is intrin&s;ically Good, and therefore of moral and perpetual Obli|gation? I am &s;ure it does if it be not utterly De|prav'd and Vitiated. And it being &s;o, will not thy heart condemn thee for the&s;e things, and what Confidence can'&s;t thou have toward GOD when he &s;hall come to enter into judgment with thee.</P>
<P>BUT I come to the Improvement of the Do|ctrine, which &s;hall be in a few Inferences from it. And,</P>
<P>Inf. 1. <HI>IT Sugge&s;ts to us the Excellency of the Word of GOD or Chri&s;tian In&s;titation.</HI> What mat|ter of Thankfulne&s;s the Gift of it is, and with what Expre&s;&s;ions of Affection and Regard it de|&s;erves to be received and entertained by every one. This is the Reveal'd Religion (Objective|ly taken) I haye been &s;peaking of, and altho'
<PB N="26" REF="003260_0027_0FF02E0C8D009918">there are many con&s;iderations recommending &amp; be&s;peaking its Excellency, yet among them all there is none perhaps that more does &s;o than this now before us. This mu&s;t be evident to every one that con&s;iders either the Intrin&s;ick Excellen|cy or Goodne&s;s of Natural Religion, or how much all our Intere&s;ts, pre&s;ent or future, depend and are embarqued upon it. There is an Intrin|&s;ick or Inherent Goodne&s;s in all the parts of it, Doctrinal or Practical. This can't be &s;aid of eve|ry thing in Reveal'd Religion, there being &s;ome things in it concerning which we may &s;ay, they are not intrin&s;ically Good, or have no Goodne&s;s in them Antecedent to their being matters of Di|vine Po&s;itive Command or In&s;titution. They are not in them&s;elves Good and therefore Com|manded, but Good only becau&s;e Commanded, what of Goodne&s;s is in them re&s;ults from the Command or In&s;titution only.</P>
<P>BUT otherwi&s;e it is with the &s;everal parts of Natural Religion, there was a Goodne&s;s in them Antecedent to the Command, and which was the rea&s;on of it. This is the ca&s;e, I &s;ay, not only with &s;uch things in it as are of a Practical Nature, but al&s;o &s;uch as are Doctrinal or Speculative. There is an Intrin&s;ick Goodne&s;s or Excellency in them, as they all tend to advance our Nature, to make us better, more wi&s;e and good, and Con|&s;equently more happy; are not proper only to Grati&s;y a vain and u&s;ele&s;s Curio&s;ity, but to ex|cite in us the Love of GOD, and a concern for
<PB N="27" REF="003260_0028_0FF02E5168268C98">our own Happine&s;s, as every one can't but &s;ee that con&s;iders what they are.</P>
<P>Again, WHEN its con&s;idered how E&s;&s;ential Natural Religion in all the parts of it is to all our Intere&s;ts, Pre&s;ent or Future, it further be&s;peaks the Excellency of the Chri&s;tian or Reveal'd Reli|gion on the &s;core of this property of it mention'd in my Doctrine. Who can pretend, or &s;o much as flatter him&s;elf with an hope of doing well ei|ther here or hereafter without it, or in the neglect of the Faith &amp; Ob&s;ervance of it? To in&s;tance in the la&s;t only, What Man is there, who ab|&s;tracting or &s;eparating from is &s;uch Duties or Rules of Chri&s;tianity as are purely Supernatural, or known by Revelation only, &s;hould make them his only Rule or Guide; who, I &s;ay, thus doing could &s;o much as flatter him&s;elf with an hope of do|ing well hereafter? Be &s;ure if there be &s;uch a man, he mu&s;t be one of a very depraved Con&s;cience indeed; and every one will &s;ay the hope of &s;uch a Per&s;on is an hope again&s;t hope, an hope without any Warrant or Countenance from the Word of GOD, yea in direct Oppo&s;ition to it. What, can that man that ob&s;erving only the Rituals or Po&s;i|tives of Chri&s;tianity, &s;hall at the &s;ame time live in the Neglect and Defiance of tho&s;e Weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy &amp; Faith, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.23. Can &s;uch a Man, I &s;ay, do well at la&s;t? Has not the Word of GOD told us, (&amp; does not Con&s;cience a&s;&s;ure us of the Truth of it) That all <HI>Murtherers, Whoremongers, Liars, Thieves,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;hall have their part in the Lake that Burns with
<PB N="28" REF="003260_0029_0FF02E10C658C180">Fire and Brim&s;tone?</HI> Rev. 21.8. In like man|ner, as to our Comfort or Wel-being here, how much is it dependant on this part, or the&s;e Du|ties of Natural Religion? Who could live in the World, or would &s;o much as de&s;ire it, were Judgment, Mercy and Faith bani&s;hed from it; and did men univer&s;ally live in an open Defiance of them, &amp; the many Relative Duties compri&s;ed under tho&s;e more general heads? Certainly no man would; for this at once would turn the world into an Hell, and render it a Place intolerable to be endured or born.</P>

And likewi&s;e al&s;o the men leaving the Natural u&s;e of the Woman, burned in their lu&s;ts, one towards another, men with men working that which is un&s;eemly, and Receiving in them&s;elves that Recompence of their Error which was Meet And that even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave
<PB N="30" REF="003260_0031_0FF02E126C7A7D68">them up to a reprobate Mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not convenient, Being filled with all Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, Fornication, Wickedne&s;s, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Maliciou&s;|ne&s;s, full of Envy, Murther, Debate, Deceit, Malig|nity, Whi&s;perers, Backbiters, Haters of God, De&s;pite|ful, Proud, Boa&s;ters, Inventers of Evil things, Di&s;o|bedient to Parents, without Under&s;tanding, Covenant Breakers, without Natural Affection, Implacable, &V;nmerciful,</HI> Ver. 22 <HI>ad</HI> 31. 'Tis of the Gentile World the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks; and a very dark Character every one will &s;ay, it is indeed. Well might the Church when it was in Captivity there, complain of it, and groan under it as an In&s;up|portable Burden; and beg of GOD that he would have re&s;pect to his Covenant, and deliver them from it. How amazing was their Corrup|tion in matters both of Faith and Practice! And how little to be &s;een (at lea&s;t among many of them) even of the primary &amp; more known truths of Nature, is hence manife&s;t. Whith relation to matters of Faith or Doctrine the Apo&s;tle &s;ays of them ver. 21. <HI>They became vain in their Imagi|nations,</HI> or Rea&s;onings. Some of them deny'd the being of GOD, others doubted of it, &s;ome affirm|ed there was but one GOD, others that there was a Plura&s;ity, yea a Multiplicity of them, which they di&s;tineni&s;h'd into various Orders, &amp; a&s;&s;igned them their &s;everal Provinces: Some that acknow|ledge the Being of GOD, yet denyed his Provi|dence; others who own'd his Providence, yet con|fined it in its exerci&s;e, &amp; excluded many things from the in&s;pection &amp; care of it. Thus Vain were
<PB N="31" REF="003260_0032_0FF02E56166BA790">they in their Imaginations, concerning the&s;e things: Nor were they better in things Practical, as appears by their bloody Spectacles, their humane Sacrifices, their Fea&s;ts in honour of the Godde&s;s <HI>Cybele,</HI> their <HI>Floralia, Bacchanalia, Satur|nalia, &amp;c.</HI> in which things their Debaucheries &amp; Lewdne&s;s were indeed too &s;hameful &amp; notorious to relate.</P>
<P>AND if a rea&s;on of the&s;e things in the Gen|tile world be demanded, my Text in &s;hort, &s;ugge&s;ts it, when it &s;ets it forth by the Phra&s;e of the dark places of the Earth, <HI>i e.</HI> Tho&s;e Places where there was nothing of Supernatural Revelation, or Reveal'd Religion; nothing but the imperfect light of Nature to guide and govern men. For this rea&s;on it was that there was &s;o little of Na|tural Religion to be &s;een in many of them Its true indeed tho&s;e abominations of the Gentiles there &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle, are mentioned as what were in a great mea&s;ure Penal, as Evils they were given up to by GOD in way of Puni&s;hment for their Idolatry. But then if a rea&s;on of that (<HI>viz.</HI> their Idolatry) be demanded, it mu&s;t be Finally re&s;olved into this as one main rea&s;on of it, <HI>viz</HI> their want of Revealed Religion, or Word of GOD.

<P>Inf. 3. <HI>IS Revealed Religion a thing of &s;uch benign Influence, as we have heard, on that which is Natural,
<PB N="32" REF="003260_0033_0FF02E141CBB9F10">then how Inexcu&s;able are &s;uch Per&s;ons</HI> (Favoured with the ble&s;&s;ing of Reveal'd Religion) <HI>as in whom Natural Religion &s;inks or declines and comes behind what is to be found in the Gentile world, or in per&s;ons not &s;o favoured.</HI> This its certain is many times the ca&s;e with per&s;ons thus indulged &amp; advantaged. Natural Religion, in&s;tead of making tho&s;e Advances or Improvements in them that might Rea&s;onably be expected, under the benign Influ|ences of Revealed, declines or goes back even to that degree as to come much behind what may be found in per&s;ons that have only the light of Na|ture to Improve or Cultivate it. And is not this the ca&s;e with Multitudes within the Chri&s;tian Pale in this our day? To their great reproach &amp; &s;hame may it not be &s;aid, that there is more of Natural Religion in &s;ome, yea many in the Gentile World, than in them? More of the love of GOD, and other Acts of Natural Wor&s;hip: And more of the Second Table duties both Solitary and So|cial: More Temperance, Cha&s;tity, Ju&s;tice, Cha|rity, Unanimity, Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than there is in them. This is an Undoubted truth, how much &s;oever it may be to the di&s;honour &amp; reproach of &s;uch per|&s;ons: Yet it being as we have heard its a Lamen|tation, and &s;hould be for a Lamentation. Chri&s;t tells Capernaum, Chorazin &amp; Beth&s;aida, Mat. 11. 21&mdash;24. That it &s;hall be more tolerable for tho&s;e dark places of the Earth, Tyre &amp; Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of Judgment, than for them. And <HI>Mat.</HI> 12 41, 42.

<P>In Particular here.</P>
<P>AS for Our&s;elves in this Land, is there not rea&s;on to fear we are ha&s;tning apace to this &s;tate or ca&s;e? For how does this Main or more Mo|mentous part of Chri&s;tianity decline in many among us every day? Yea as for the mo&s;t of us, may it not be &s;aid that &s;ome of the Po&s;itives or Rituals of Revealed, In&s;tituted Religion, or Wor|&s;hip only, are Enough, we are Contented with them, and as for tho&s;e more weighty matters of Natural Religion, Judgment Mercy &amp; Faith they are little regarded by us. And how many in the Gentile world have there been, and now are, in whom more of the&s;e things may be &s;een than in us? Finally,</P>
<P>Inf. 4. <HI>WHAT we have heard Sugge&s;ts to us the great de&s;ign of God in Revealed Religion and the In|&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of it: what it is that he has in View therein.</HI> And it lets us know that the Pre&s;ervation and Improvement of Natural Religion in the World, is the great thing he Scopes at in the&s;e things. For if Revealed Religion be &s;o fit and proper a means for the&s;e Ends, as we have heard, then we may well pre&s;ume this is the great de&s;ign of GOD therein &amp; in all the In&s;titutions of it.</P>
<P>AND this con&s;ideration furni&s;hes me with pro|per matter of Addre&s;s to &s;uch of my Reverend Brethren as are here pre&s;ent on this Occa&s;ion.
<PB N="34" REF="003260_0035_0FF02E1849F44760"><HI>Reverend and much E&s;teemed,</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible that in what I have &s;aid I have gone in &s;omewhat an Untrodden Path: And perhaps it may be tho't by &s;ome here pre&s;ent, that the Argument I have been upon is improper and very aliene from what might be Expected on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as this. However I can't think it altogether &s;o, &s;ince as its a matter well de&s;erving to be more univer&s;ally known and con&s;ider'd by Chri&s;tians than it is, &s;o furni&s;hes me with fit matter of Addre&s;s to you: and &s;ugge&s;ts to you and me, and all others of our Character, one great Ar|ticle of Duty, needful to be ob&s;erved by us in the whole Cour&s;e of our Mini&s;try, <HI>viz</HI> That therein we take Care to &s;hew due regard to the great, Important matters of Natural Religion, and &s;eek the furtherance of Per&s;ons in them by all the means we are capable of. This is an ea&s;y deduction from the Inference now made of GODs de&s;ign in Reveal'd Religion, and the In|&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of it. For if the Pre&s;ervation and Improvement of Natural Religion in the hearts and lives of Men, be his great End therein, then this &s;ure is what we al&s;o in the Cour&s;e of our Mini&s;try &s;hould very much &s;cope at, and lay out our&s;elves in. 'Tis very obvious to every one that reads the Scriptures, that the things falling under this Head, are there &s;poken of as of an Importance and Obligation above others: Tho&s;e great Duties of Natural Religion, Judg|ment, Mercy and Faith are call'd <HI>The weightier matters of the Law.</HI> Mat. 23.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Hereby intimating to us what is now &s;ugge&s;ted as our Duty. I would not here be un|der&s;tood, to &s;ugge&s;t as if this were to be our only Work in our Mini&s;try, or that we were to Preach and Pre&s;s no other Truths and Duties than the&s;e No we mu&s;t Preach and Pre&s;s Do|ctrines and Duties purely Evangelical, as well as tho&s;e of Natural Religion. That My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, the Doctrine of mans Redemption by Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t handle it in all the parts of it; and thereby let &s;inners know that their life is in CHRIST. We mu&s;t Preach <HI>the un&s;earchable riches of CHRIST;</HI> &s;et before &s;inners tho&s;e Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Grace that are laid up in him.

We may not therefore &s;eparate them.</P>
<P>AND unle&s;s we take care in this point; we &s;hall in vain attempt the Conver&s;ion of Sinners to <HI>CHRIST;</HI> the&s;e things being of the E&s;&s;ence of every true Convert. <HI>Faith without works is Dead,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="003260_0037_0FF02E19D0C05480">and let a mans mind be never &s;o well enrich'd and &s;tor'd with &s;peculations in Faith, be they never &s;o curious, yet after all, if this be all he has, he is &s;o far from being a true Convert or Chri&s;tian in reallity, that he is but a wi&s;e or learned Fool We mu&s;t therefore let Di&s;cour&s;es of this nature and tendency have their due time and place in our Preaching.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Particular with a pa&s;&s;age or two from that learned Man &amp; good Chri&s;tian of our own Nation (Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>) <Q>Two things (&s;ays he) make up a Chri&s;tian, <HI>viz.</HI> A true Faith, and an hone&s;t Conver&s;ation: And tho' the former ordinarily gives us the Title, the latter is the &s;urer For true Profe&s;&s;ion without an hone&s;t Conver&s;ation, not only Saves not, but encrea&s;es our weight of Puni&s;h|ment; but a good Life without a true Profe&s;|&s;ion though it bring us not to Heaven, yet it le&s;&s;ens the mea&s;ure of our Judgment; &s;o that a Moral Man, &s;o called is a Chri&s;tian by the &s;urer &s;ide.

O how did he Pray, and redeem Time for Prayer! How did he Preach! With what Authority! With what Energy! <HI>Never Man &s;pake like this Man,</HI> &s;ay his Hearers. How Excellent was his Speech &amp; Con|ver&s;ation! Out of his Mouth proceeded none <HI>but Gracious Words.</HI> Words proper to Communi|cate at the &s;ame time, both Light, Life &amp; Heat. How carefully did he embrace all Opportunities of doing Good both to the Souls and Bodies of Men! What time did he &s;pend in Idle, Imper|tinent Di&s;cour&s;e, who made the Hearts of tho&s;e Burn within them, whom he Occa&s;ionally fell in Company with? <HI>Luk.</HI> 24.32 And how did he go up and down doing Good! And always and only the things that were well plea&s;ing to GOD! Let HIM be your Pattern, &s;o doing, you can't fail of a good End at la&s;t.</ITEM>

<P N="2">2. <HI>THE relation I &s;tand in to you of that Society now going off from us, allows me al&s;o to demand your Attention to a few Words, which I Intreat your remem|brance of, as &s;ome of the la&s;t words, perhaps, you are like to hear from me, at lea&s;t, in this wi&s;e.</HI> And it mu&s;t &s;uffice to hint here al&s;o, Then</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) <HI>ACCO&V;NT it a Favour that the Kingdom of GOD is coming among you:</HI> I mean the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom, in the Di&s;pen&s;ation, Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of it. Look not upon the&s;e things as the Generality of Men in our Day are wont to do, but with the &s;ame Sentiments the Wi&s;e and Good in all Ages have done. What a rai&s;ed E&s;teem have they had of the&s;e things, you may &s;ee it, I&s;a. 53.7. <HI>How Beautiful upon the Mountains are the Feet of him that bringeth Good Tidings, that Publi&s;heth Peace, that bringeth good Tidings of Good, that Publi&s;heth Salvation, that &s;aith unto Zion, Thy GOD Reigneth?</HI> P&s;al. 27.4 <HI>One thing have I de&s;ired of the LORD,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the Hou&s;e of the LORD all the Days of my Life,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>q d.</HI> Tho' I am exerci&s;ed with many Troubles, there is but One thing I am very Solicitous about, or De&s;irous of, and that is not Victory and Triumph over
<PB N="44" REF="003260_0045_0FF02E29E908A768">mine Enemies, not the Peace, Wealth and Glory of my Kingdom, but that I may not be di&s;turbed in, or driven from the Sanctuary and Wor&s;hip of GOD as I have been, but may have Opportunity of con&s;tant Attendance there:</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) <HI>LOOK to your Principles, Aims or Ends, in the Affair you are now engaged in; and take heed of tho&s;e low, mean &amp; ba&s;e Views many are wont to be In|fluenced by in &s;uch Affairs.</HI> And as you ought to look upon the Conduct of the Divine Providence toward you in the pre&s;ent Day as a Token for good, &s;o take heed how by this means or any o|ther you deprive your &s;elves of it. Again,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) <HI>LOVE the</HI> LORDS DAY <HI>and remember to keep it Holy.</HI> There is no Duty more Rea&s;on|able than this, and yet there is, perhaps, none more Neglected. That Man that Loves not SABBATHS in this World, nor the Duties of them, let him know and con&s;ider it, that as he has no ju&s;t rea&s;on to hope he has Right or Title to the Eternal Sabbati&s;m, or Re&s;t of the People of GOD in the other World, &s;o &s;hall he never enter into it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4) <HI>REMEMBER that your time is &s;hort and pa&s;&s;ing every Day:</HI> And in the whole of your Conduct Expre&s;s and hold forth a &s;en&s;e of it. Live for Heaven every Day, and carefully embrace all favourable junctures or opportunities to &s;ecure the re&s;t of the Ble&s;&s;ed there, and gather fruit unto Eternal Life. <HI>I mu&s;t,</HI> &s;ays CHRIST, <HI>Work the Works of Him that Sent me while it is Day, the Night cometh wherein vo Man can work.</HI></ITEM>

(5) <HI>TAKE heed of this Deceitful World, the many Perils and Snares of it;</HI> And particularly tho&s;e &s;eemingly Innocent and Lawful things of it by which &s;uch Multitudes are wounded, &amp; ruin'd er'e they are aware. Alas, how many are there that peri&s;h by lawful things! In a word,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(6) <HI>HIM who is now to be &s;et over you, receive in the LORD, and in all re&s;pects Conduct your &s;elves to|ward him as the Character he is putting on, will demand at your hands.</HI> This is what <HI>Paul</HI> demands of the <HI>Philippians</HI> in behalf of his beloved Epaphroditus, Phil. 2.29. <HI>Receive him in the LORD with all glad|ne&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame I demand of you in behalf of him, who is now to be &s;et over you, and that you carry it toward him as the Character he is putting on will require. This, in &s;hort, is that of <HI>A MINISTER OF CHRIST, i. e.</HI> A Per&s;on Deputed by the Command, and Inve&s;ted with Authority from CHRIST to Mini&s;ter in Holy things: To Preach the Word, Admini&s;ter Sa|craments, and to Rule over you.

And various are the things it will Entitle him to, and Demand at your Hands, as <HI>viz.</HI> That you <HI>hold him in Re|putation,</HI> carry it toward him with <HI>Deference and Re&s;pect,</HI> That you <HI>Submit your&s;elves</HI> to him in the LORD. That you <HI>Provide for his outward Sub|&s;i&s;tence and Comfort</HI> as far as you can. That you Avoid every thing tending to <HI>Grieve and Wound
<PB N="46" REF="003260_0047_0FF02E76216C9848">his Spirit,</HI> Di&s;courage him in his Work, or Weaken his Hands in it. And Finally, that by <HI>your Pray|ers for him,</HI> you a&s;&s;i&s;t him therein. To Conclude, Labour to be Compleat in the whole Will of GOD, Faultle&s;s and without Rebuke, holding forth the Word of Life, that both He and I may Rejoice in the Day of CHRIST that we have not Run in vain, neither Laboured in Vain.</ITEM>

<P><HI>AND now Brethren, I Commend you to GOD &amp; to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are Sanctified,</HI> Act. 20.</P>
<P>I have done when I have added</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ONE Word, to You of this Society, of which I my &s;elf as yet have the Care and Charge.</HI> It is this Day <HI>Twenty Six Years</HI> wanting Three Days only, &s;ince I was &s;et apart to the Work of the Mini&s;try in this Place. We were then Small and Few in Number, not <HI>Thirty Families,</HI> I think, but now are grown up to more than <HI>Two Hundred,</HI> and are become <HI>Three Societies</HI> for Divine Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>MANY and very Signal have been the Mer|cies of GOD to us in this Place &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>IN Particular, Be&s;ides that fir&s;t and chief of Ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>the Go&s;pel or Reveal'd Religion,</HI> which we have all along enjoy'd, be&s;ides this I &s;ay, very remarkable has been the <HI>Health</HI> we have been favour'd with: no <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> having been &s;ent a|mong us, that has carried off any con&s;iderable Numbers of us in a &s;hort time, as has been the Ca&s;e with many other Places. The whole Num|ber of tho&s;e of any Age, Sex or Nation that have
<PB N="47" REF="003260_0048_0FF02E709D0A4F98">been removed by Death in this Place, amounts not yet to <HI>Two Hundred:</HI> I think it ri&s;es not higher than <HI>One Hundred and Seventy.</HI> An In|&s;tance of &s;paring Mercy is this which perhaps can &s;carcely be parallell'd. We have had al&s;o the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Peace &amp; Unity</HI> &s;o far that no common, general Breach or Divi&s;ion has as yet been a|mong us. GOD has al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed our <HI>Handy Work</HI> &s;o far, that many of us who came hither <HI>Poor &amp; Needy,</HI> are now become <HI>men of Sub&s;tance.</HI> Other in&s;tances of Mercy expre&s;&s;ive of the Di|vine Regard to us, I might now reflect upon. But Sirs, What have our returns been to them all? How mean, &amp; poor? And how can we with|out &s;hame and blu&s;hing, call them to mind while we are thus reflecting on the Mercies of GOD to us? How few by the&s;e and other Cords of his Love have been drawn to him? And now many yet &s;tand out, hardning their hearts again&s;t both his Favours and Frowns, and &s;trengthning their Re&s;olutions in &s;in, and refu&s;ing to come in and &s;urrender them&s;elves to him, tho' by the&s;e his mercies (as well as otherwi&s;e) he has entitled him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;ervice? I have not &s;hun'd to declare to you <HI>the Coun&s;el of GOD</HI> in this, as well as other Points; &amp; how often have I pre&s;s'd this Duty, &amp; what pains I have taken, by removing Ob|&s;tacles &amp; Difficulties, to clear your way to it, you your &s;elves are my Witne&s;&s;es. But after all, how many &s;till remain Deaf and Unper&s;wadeable! And will &s;uch continue thus to do &s;till? <HI>Will you thus requite the LORD? O Fooli&s;h and &V;nwi&s;e!</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="003260_0049_0FF02E7899829808">Thus Requite thy Father that Begat thee, the GOD that hath Made thee, &amp; E&s;tabli&s;hed thee? If &s;o, you will have rea&s;on to expect the Pa&s;t In|dulgent Methods of his Providence towards you will be chang'd, and that by &s;ome Terrible things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s He'll vi&s;it you.</P>
<P><HI>TO Conclude,</HI> I am now arrived well nigh to the End of my Mini&s;try among you: The <HI>Levites</HI> of Old were Di&s;charged from their Mini&s;trations in the Tabernacle &amp; Temple at <HI>the Age of Fifty;</HI> &amp; as I am now arrived to <HI>that Age,</HI> &s;o diver&s;e things there are that plead hard for a Relea&s;e; In par|ticular, and more e&s;pecially the difficulty of Preaching does &s;o; the Bellows are almo&s;t Con|&s;um'd and Burn'd, and rare it is that I Preach a Sermon without &s;uch Effects following, as a&s;&s;ure me the End of my Mini&s;try (if not of my Life) is not far off, &amp; occa&s;ion Fle&s;h &amp; Blood many times to &s;ay, <HI>Never Preach a Sermon more.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, while I &s;tand Related to you as now I do, as I &s;hall not cea&s;e bearing you on my Heart, &s;o neither to &s;tir you up by putting you in Remembrance of your Duty.</P>
<P>I Conclude with that Excellent Prayer of the Apo&s;tle. Enclo&s;ing, as one &s;ays, the whole My&s;tery of Divine Grace, both in its Original, and way of Communication by CHRIST; Heb. 13.20, 21. <HI>Now the GOD of Peace that brought again from the Dead, Our LORD JESUS, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the Everla&s;ting Covenant, make you Perfect in every Good Work to do His Will, Working in you that which is well plea&s;ing in His Sight, through JESUS CHRIST, to whom be Glory for Ever &amp; Ever, MEN.</HI></P>
