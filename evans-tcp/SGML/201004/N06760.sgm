<P>Beloved believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God, becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone forth into the World.</P>

<P>IN this Scripture, we may take Notice of the&s;e &s;ix Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Apo&s;tle gives Notice to the belov|ed Congregations of &s;piritual Chri&s;tians, of a great Evil ri&s;en up in the World, which (if not
<PB N="4" REF="008578_0003_102F8747CD274F40">carefully heeded) might occa&s;ion &s;ome great Trouble and Danger to them; <HI>many fal&s;e Pro|phets</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>are gone out into the World,</HI> V. 1.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He pre&s;cribes them a &s;ufficient Remedy a|gain&s;t this Evil, &s;aying, <HI>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Faithful may be able to make a right Judgment of Spirits, he gives them one &s;hort Rule of Trial, which yet comprehends in it&s;elf all Rules; Ver&s;es 2 and 3. <HI>Hereby know we the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is of God; and every Spirit that confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is not of God,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He &s;hews them with whom the&s;e fal&s;e Pro|phets, who have the Spirit of Anti-chri&s;t, &s;hould not prevail; <HI>viz.</HI> with none of the true Chri&s;ti|ans of God, Ver&s;e 4. <HI>Ye are of God, little Chil|dren, and have overcome them; becau&s;e greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He &s;hews them with whom the fal&s;e Pro|phets, &s;hould prevail, <HI>viz.</HI> with the World and carnal People; Ver&s;e 5. <HI>They are of the World, therefore &s;peak they of the World, and the World heareth them.</HI> The World, &s;eeking its own Things, receives Anti-chri&s;t, and his Prophets.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He &s;hews how the Spirit of Truth and Error may be known in the People, as well as in the Teachers; <HI>viz.</HI> by the Peoples cleaving, ei|ther to the Teachers of Truth, or to the Teach|ers of Error; Ver&s;e 6. <HI>We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God,

</LIST>
<P>The&s;e &s;ix Things are held forth to us, in this Scripture, and they are all very profitable and nece&s;&s;ary for the true Church to be acquainted withal, e&s;pecially in the&s;e la&s;t of the la&s;t Times. I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t, which is,</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="point">
<HEAD>The <HI>FIRST POINT.</HI> The great and dangerous Evil, of which the Apo|&s;tle gives Notice to the Church of Believers; <HI>and that is,</HI> the going out of fal&s;e Prophets into the World.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND here it is to be noted, that from the very Beginning of the World, there have been two Seeds or Generations of Men, very contrary the one to the other; as is evident in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> iii. 15. where God &s;aith to the Serpent, <HI>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed;</HI> &s;o that the Serpent hath his Seed, as well as the Woman her Seed; and this was the Woman's Cur&s;e, to have her <HI>Sorrows and Conceptions multiplied,</HI> and to bring forth the Serpent's Seed, as well as her own, that is, the Children or Seed of the fir&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing; and both the&s;e contrary Seeds do partake of one and the &s;ame common Nature, or Humanity. And one of the&s;e Seeds are called, <HI>The Sons of God;</HI> the other, <HI>The Sons of Men, Gene&s;is</HI> vi. 6. And both the&s;e, being the Children of one <HI>Adam,</HI> ac|cording
<PB N="6" REF="008578_0005_102F874B1BB769C8">to the Fle&s;h, are yet di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;e|veral Spirits, that dwell in them, and in&s;pire them: For the Spirit of God, that is, the Spirit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth, doth in&s;pire the one, and the&s;e are truly called the Children of God, as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Romans</HI> viii. <HI>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</HI> And the Spirit of Satan, which is the Spirit of Wic|kedne&s;s and Error, doth in&s;pire the other; and the&s;e are truly called, the Sons of Men, who all have &s;inned, and are deprived of the Glory of God.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e two different and contrary Spirits, which have dwelt in the&s;e two di&s;tinct Seeds, have begun to act pre&s;ently from the very Begin|ning of the World, each one according to its own Nature, and to trade and traffick about Mankind, and out of it, to bring forth Children to them&s;elves, like to them&s;elves in all Things; and &s;o one hath endeavoured to beget and bring forth the Children of God, and of Truth; the other, the Children of Men, and of Error: And to this End, the one hath held forth the Truth of God, by the true Spirit of God; the other hath held forth Error and Fal&s;hood, yet as it were the Truth: The one hath endeavoured to bring Man unto God, through true Faith and Repentance; the other to turn Men from God, through Sin: The one hath &s;ought to work Sal|vation in Men, the other De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Now the fal&s;e Spirit hath been the mo&s;t com|mon in the World, and hath had the greate&s;t Opportunities and Advantages to multiply it&s;elf,
<PB N="7" REF="008578_0006_102F874EC55ED120">&s;eeing it finds the whole World already lying in Wickedne&s;s, and fully prepared to receive it&s;elf. But the true Spirit hath been found in very Few, and that from the Beginning; for there have been but few true Prophets, who have had the true Spirit, and have &s;poken the true Word; as you may &s;ee all along in Scriptures, e&s;pecially in the Times of <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Micajah,</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aith, <HI>many fal&s;e Prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and deceive many;</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aith in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle, Chapter ii. Ver&s;es 1, 2. <HI>That as there were fal&s;e Prophets a|mong the People,</HI> that is, the Jews, <HI>&s;o there &s;hall be fal&s;e Doctors and Teachers among the Chri&s;tians,</HI> who &s;hould <HI>privily bring in damnable Here&s;ies;</HI> and <HI>that many &s;hould follow their pernicious Ways.</HI></P>
<P>So that as there have been many fal&s;e Pro|phets from the Beginning, &s;o e&s;pecially in the Days of the New-Te&s;tament; for the more Chri&s;t hath appeared by his spirit to lead Men in|to Truth, the more hath the Devil appeared by his Spirit to lead Men into Error; and this is pro|perly called Anti-chri&s;t; For Fle&s;h and Blood is not Anti-chri&s;t; but a Spirit contrary to Chri&s;t's Spirit, that dwells in Fle&s;h and Blood, and chief|ly among tho&s;e that profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion; this is Anti-chri&s;t.</P>
<P>No Spirit, in the Jews or Gentiles, is proper|ly called Anti-chri&s;t, but the Spirit of Satan in fal&s;e Chri&s;tians, appearing as an Angel of Light, this is Anti-chri&s;t. Before Chri&s;t came in the Fle&s;h, the Devil was an evil Spirit, and a Liar, and a Murderer, and the unclean Spirit, and Prince of this World; but he was not properly Anti-chri&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="008578_0007_102F87523997CA28">becau&s;e Chri&s;t was not then come in the Fle&s;h. The Devil was the Devil before, and did dwell and work in evil Men; but from the Beginning of the Chri&s;tian Church, he is called Anti-chri&s;t, and that not every where, but in the Church or Kingdom of Chri&s;t: For Anti-chri&s;t is a Spirit that di&s;&s;olves Je&s;us, and that not openly, but &s;ub|tilly and cunningly, yea, under the Name and Pretence of Je&s;us, he is wholly contrary to him. Wherefore, the di&s;cerning of Spirits, as it hath been nece&s;&s;ary from the Beginning of the World, &s;o al&s;o it is e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary in the Days of the Go&s;pel, wherein the My&s;tery of Iniquity is be|come mo&s;t my&s;terious, through the Operation of Anti-chri&s;t, in tho&s;e <HI>many fal&s;e Prophets which are gone forth into the World.</HI> And &s;o we proceed to the &s;econd Point.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="point">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> SECOND POINT.</HEAD>
<P>And that is this, <HI>That &s;ufficient Remedy, which the Apo&s;tle pre&s;cribes to the true Church, again&s;t that great Evil of many fal&s;e Prophets being gone out into the World.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Remedy the Apo&s;tle pre&s;cribes to the Faithful again&s;t the&s;e fal&s;e Prophets, is not that they &s;hould &s;tir up the &s;ecular Power to im|pri&s;on, bani&s;h or burn them, that &s;o they might be rid of them; for this is Anti-chri&s;t's proper Remedy again&s;t tho&s;e that oppo&s;e him; but the Apo&s;tle &s;hews a more Chri&s;tian Remedy, which is this, <HI>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they be of God;</HI> and this Remedy alone is &s;ufficient for the true &s;piritual Church of the
<PB N="9" REF="008578_0008_102F8753D70AF4D0">Faithful in every Age, to pre&s;erve it &s;afe and &s;ound again&s;t all fal&s;e Teachers what&s;oever, and their fal&s;e Doctrines; neither doth it de&s;ire or need any other. Wherefore in this Ca&s;e the Apo&s;tle contents him&s;elf to give only this Caution to the Faithful, <HI>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spi|rits, whether they be of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Believe not every Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. That is, every one that &s;peaketh of &s;piritual Things. Whence it is plain, that we neither ought ra&s;hly and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ly to believe every Man's Doctrine, nor yet ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly to cen&s;ure and condemn it, till it be heard and known what it is: But it is a Chri&s;tian's Duty to <HI>prove all Things, and to hold fa&s;t that which is Good,</HI> upon Proof, as <HI>Paul</HI> ad|vi&s;eth; wherefore <HI>John</HI> al&s;o adds here, <HI>But try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</HI></P>
<P>Whence we note, That Chri&s;tians have Right and Power to try and judge the Spirits and Doc|trines of their Teachers: And this is evident by many plain Scriptures; as,</P>
<P>Matthew vii. 15. <HI>Beware of fal&s;e Prophets</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t to the Faithful) <HI>which come unto you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves; ye &s;hall know them by their Fruits.</HI></P>
<P>Matthew xvi. 6. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, take heed and beware of the Leaven of the Phari&s;ees, which is Hypocri&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>Matthew xvi. 4. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid, take heed that no no Man deceive you, for many &s;hall come in my Name, &s;aying, I am Chri&s;t, and &s;hall deceive many.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008578_0009_102F8759DD3C67D0">
John x. <HI>My Sheep hear my Voice, and know my Voice, and a Stranger will they not hear, but flee from him, for they know not</HI> (that is, <HI>own not</HI>) <HI>the Voice of Strangers. And all that came before me are Thieves and Robbers, but the Sheep did not hear them.</HI></P>
<P>By all which Scriptures, and many more that might be added, it is manife&s;t that the Faithful, the true Sheep of Chri&s;t, have Right and Power to judge of the Spirit and Doctrines of the Teachers.</P>
<P>Let Fathers, Schoolmen, Doctors, Councils, A&s;&s;emblies of Divines, Univer&s;ities, Mini&s;ters, propound and publi&s;h what Doctrine they plea&s;e, the Sheep of Chri&s;t, the faithful Flock, have Power and Authority from Chri&s;t him&s;elf to try and judge, whether the Things they &s;peak be of Chri&s;t, or of them&s;elves, and of Anti-chri&s;t. And this Power the faithful People ought not to part with, neither for any Fear, nor for any Favour.</P>
<P>Yea, it mo&s;t nearly concerns the Faithful to try the Spirits, and judge the Doctrines of the Teachers, for the&s;e two Con&s;iderations, among others.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e we mu&s;t each one give an Ac|count for our&s;elves before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t: Wherefore it concerns every one of us to look to our own eternal Condition, and not to leave this Care to others for us. In Death and Judgment, each one mu&s;t an&s;wer for him&s;elf; and therefore we ought to be as certain of the Word of God, on which we build our immortal Souls, as we are &s;ure we live, and are Creatures;
<PB N="11" REF="008578_0010_102F875F058CF988">we ought, I &s;ay, to be &s;ure our&s;elves, and not to tru&s;t any Body for us in this great Matter, whereon depends either eternal Life, or eternal Death.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It concerns us to try the Spirits and Doctrines, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e we may ea&s;ily mi|&s;take, and in&s;tead of Anti-chri&s;t, and his Di&s;ciples, da&s;h again&s;t Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and his precious Saints. Yea, we have &s;een how the World, and worldly Church, not being able to try the Spirits and Doctrines, have contradicted and crucified the Son of God him&s;elf, and have reproached and per&s;ecuted all his People, who are baptized into one Spirit with him; and doing this, they have thought they have done God good Service too; and all becau&s;e they were not able to judge of the Spirit and Truth of Chri&s;t in him&s;elf and his Members, but have followed the Judgment and Coun&s;el of the chief Guides in the outward Church, who have cau&s;ed them to err, and to mi&s;take Truth for Error, and Error for Truth, Chri&s;t for Anti-chri&s;t, and Anti-chri&s;t for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Wherefore it concerns every one to be wi&s;e to Salvation for him&s;elf, and to try the Spirits for him&s;elf, and not to content him&s;elf to &s;ay; thus &s;aid <HI>Augu&s;tine, Ambro&s;e, Hierom,</HI> &amp;c. or this was the Judgment of the Fathers, or thus have the Councils or Univer&s;ities determined, or thus do our Mini&s;ters teach us; but if thou art one of Chri&s;t's Flock, thou mu&s;t have Skill to know and judge for thy&s;elf, which is Chri&s;t's Spirit and Doctrine, and which is Anti-chri&s;t's; other|wi&s;e thou wilt certainly mi&s;carry in this great
<PB N="12" REF="008578_0011_102F8761519E3930">Matter, and be undone for ever. If thou build on Men in the&s;e Things, and can&s;t not judge for thy&s;elf, thou wilt be &s;ure to be undone.</P>
<P>But now this Power of trying Spirits, and judg|ing Doctrines, which Chri&s;t hath given his true Flock, and which they ought to have upon &s;o good Grounds, the Teachers of the fal&s;e and Anti-chri&s;tian Church, that is, the common Cler|gy, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal Names, Titles, and Degrees, have robbed them of, and have fal&s;ly and treacherou&s;ly arrogated to them&s;elves the Power of trying Spirits, and judging Doctrines, and have &s;aid, that it belongs to the Clergy, or national Mini&s;try, and their Councils, and A&s;&s;em|blies of Divines, to judge of Spirits, whether they be right or fal&s;e; and to judge of Doctrines, whether they be agreeable to God's Word, or no; and that all Chri&s;tians ought to expect their Judgment and Determination, and to &s;ubmit to it, and to depend on it, as on an Oracle from Heaven, yea, though it be not only without, but al&s;o again&s;t their own particular Judgment.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Men (I mean the Clergy) through the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and temporal Power which they had gotten, have &s;tricken great Fear into the whole World, and have mi&s;erably vexed innu|merable Con&s;ciences with a grievous and la&s;ting Bondage, and have even driven them to De&s;pair, whil&s;t none dur&s;t approve or own any Spirit or Doctrine, though never &s;o manife&s;tly of Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel, without their Allowance and Ap|probation; &s;o mightily hath the Power of Anti-chri&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="008578_0012_102F876566143EC8">prevailed in the World, and that again&s;t the expre&s;s Word of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now the Ground of this their anti-chri&s;tian Pride and U&s;urpation is this, that they arrogate to them&s;elves, that they are the Guides and Shep|herds of all Chri&s;tian Men, and are to teach them the Go&s;pel, which they are only to receive from their Lips; whereas Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed his true Church, that they &s;hall be all taught of God, and &s;hall hear and learn them&s;elves from the Fa|ther, and hath al&s;o promi&s;ed to &s;end them the Spirit, to lead them in all Truth, and to give them an Anointing, to teach them all Things.</P>
<P>Now they, by robbing the Faithful of this Pow|er, and arrogating it to them&s;elves, have made them&s;elves, contrary to Chri&s;t's Command, Lords and Ma&s;ters in the Church of God, and have u&s;urped to them&s;elves Superiority and Authority over other Believers, and have &s;ubjected all the World to their Opinion and Judgment in the Things of God; by which Means, they have &s;et wide open the Flood-gates to Anti-chri&s;t, and his Kingdom, to break in upon the World, and to overflow it, whil&s;t they had robbed all Chri&s;tian People of their own Judgment in all Things of God, and had made them to depend wholly on the Judgment of the Clergy.</P>
<P>And had not Chri&s;tian People thus unchri&s;tianly delivered up their Judgments to the Clergy, and that in the very highe&s;t Points of Religion, Chri|&s;tianity had not been &s;o mi&s;erably blinded and cor|rupted as it is, and the My&s;tery of Iniquity had not &s;o much prevailed in the World, as now it
<PB N="14" REF="008578_0013_102F876C600AB688">hath. For when Chri&s;tians would not try the Spirits, whether they were of God, and the Doc|trines, whether they were the Word of God or no, but thought this a Matter too high for them, and would refer and &s;ubmit all to the Judgment of their Mini&s;ters; then Anti-chri&s;t (the Apo&s;tle of the Devil) came forth boldly, and proudly ex|alted him&s;elf above all that is called God, and his Kingdom, above all the Kingdoms of the World, having fir&s;t put out both the Eyes of Chri&s;tians, by taking away from them their Right and Power of trying Spirits, and judging Doc|trines.</P>
<P>But when true Chri&s;tians &s;hall &s;earch the Scrip|tures (as God I tru&s;t hath now fully put into their Hearts to do) and &s;hall ju&s;tly and lawfully take to them&s;elves the Power which God hath given them, to try Spirits and Doctrines, then Anti-chri&s;t, and his Agents, the carnal Clergy, mu&s;t &s;oon be brought down: For the Faithful, by that Word, &s;hall &s;oon perceive that they are not of God, nor their Doctrine of that right Go&s;pel, which is after the Mind of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Well then, by what hath been &s;aid, you who are of Chri&s;t's true Sheep may perceive, that it is evident by the Word, that faithful Chri&s;tians have Right and Power to try Spirits and Doctrines, though Anti-chri&s;t, for many Ages, hath robbed them of this Privilege.</P>
<P>For (that I may &s;peak a little more to this Matter) the Trial of Spirits doth unque&s;tiona|bly belong to all Men, who have received the Spirit of God: For to this Spirit of God which
<PB N="15" REF="008578_0014_102F876E7AEC80D0">dwells in the Faithful, the Gift of di&s;cerning Spirits is in&s;eparably annexed: And the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which truly dwells in all true Chri&s;tians, cannot deceive, nor be deceived in the Trial of Spirits. So that this now is a common Grace, that in &s;ome Mea&s;ure belongs to all true Chri&s;ti|ans, who have received the Unction that teach|eth them all Things, and is true, and is no Lye.</P>
<P>And though there be in the Church Diver&s;ities of Gifts from the &s;ame Spirit, which are given to &s;ome, and not to others, as Tongues, and In|terpretation of Tongues, and Miracles, and Gifts of healing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mentioned by <HI>Paul,</HI> I <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. yet this Gift of trying Spirits is given to all, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, that have received the Spirit. For as in the natural Body there are &s;everal Gifts given to &s;everal Members, which are no given to all the Members, as Seeing to the Eye. Hear|ing to the Ear, Walking to the Foot, &amp;c. but Feeling is given to all the Members; &s;o al&s;o in the Body of Chri&s;t, that is, the &s;piritual Church, &s;everal Gifts are given to &s;everal Saints, but the Trial of Spirits and Doctrines to Saints, who have received the Spirit; and if any have not Chri&s;t's Spirit, he is none of his; and if any have not Chri&s;t's Spirit, he can, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, di&s;cern and judge of all Spirits in the World: And the more any Man receives Chri&s;t's Spirit, the more able is he to judge of all other Spirits.</P>
<P>Wherefore they who are true Believers, and have received Chri&s;t's Spirit, their Judgment is to be preferred in the Trial of Spirits, before the Judgment of a whole Council of Clergymen.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="008578_0015_102F87705B7C7FC0">
And they only, who can try Spirits by the Spi|rit of God, and Doctrines by the Word of God, written in their Hearts by the Spirit, and fit to commend Mini&s;ters to the Work of God: That is, the Congregations of the Faithful, and not Univer&s;ities, and A&s;&s;emblies of Divines.</P>
<P>And thus you may perceive that, <HI>&s;eeing many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World,</HI> it con|cerns the Faithful, as they tender their own ever|la&s;ting Salvation, not to believe every Spirit that &s;peaks of Chri&s;t, and his Kingdom, and his Things, but to <HI>try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But now (it may be) &s;ome will be rea|dy to &s;ay, we ought indeed to try the Spirits, &s;eeing there are many fal&s;e Prophets in the World, but we hope there are no &s;uch Per&s;ons among us, but only &s;ome up-&s;tart Men, with their new Light, who with their Novelties and Fancies trouble the Nation, and would fain turn all Things Up-&s;ide down, and we know the&s;e well enough already, and do &s;ufficiently de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is very like you do; but yet let me &s;ay to you, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, un|der&s;tand your&s;elves, and know what ye do in this Matter. For at the Beginning of the Re|formation by the Mini&s;try of <HI>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin,</HI> and divers others, precious Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Popi&s;h Clergy applied all the&s;e Scriptures, <HI>Try the Spirits, whether they be of God, for many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World; and beware of fal&s;e Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves;</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="008578_0016_102F8772025221A8">I &s;ay, the&s;e, and the like Places of Scriptures, they applied to the&s;e godly Men, and yet they them&s;elves were the fal&s;e Prophets indeed, and the others, whom they termed &s;uch, were true Ones. Wherefore it is po&s;&s;ible for you to be mi|&s;taken as well as they, and no Doubt but you will be mi&s;taken, except the Lord be gracious to you, and give you his own Spirit, by which alone you can make a right Judgment in this Matter.</P>
<P>Wherefore, that he that reads may under|&s;tand, you mu&s;t know, that the fal&s;e Prophets are not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cerned as you think; for they &s;eem to be true Prophets, and godly, holy, learned, orthodox Men, Men of Eminency and Renown in the Church and State: And &s;o to Fle&s;h and Blood, and the Wi&s;dom and Religion of the World, it will be a difficult, yea, and impo&s;&s;ible Thing to find them out: For the fal&s;e Prophets have &s;everal glorious Vails over them, to hide and ob&s;cure them from common Knowledge.</P>
<P>Wherefore we declare unto you from the Word of the Lord, touching the&s;e fal&s;e Prophets, who &s;hall do &s;o much Mi&s;chief.</P>

<ITEM>1. That they &s;hall not proceed, or come forth from among the <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Turks,</HI> or out of the barbarous Nations, but they &s;hall ari&s;e out of &s;uch as are called Chri&s;tians.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Seeing among Chri&s;tians &s;ome are openly prophane and evil, others &s;eem to be religious and godly, the fal&s;e Prophets &s;hall be found among the better Sort; and therefore, &s;aith Chri&s;t, they &s;hall come in Sheeps Clothing, as if they were of Chri&s;t's own Flock: And <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith,

<P>And &s;eeing among tho&s;e who are Mini&s;ters, &s;ome are light, and vain, and carnal, and formal Per&s;ons, and others are Men of great Worth and Reputation, and &s;eem to be the precious Members of Chri&s;t, and even Pillars in the Church, &s;o that the common People think, that all Religion would go down with &s;uch good Men, they hav|ing &s;ome Gifts and Enlightenings of the Spirit, and &s;eeming more than ordinarily godly, religi|ous, wi&s;e, holy, &s;ober, devour; now the fal&s;e Prophets &s;hall be found among the&s;e. And as they who oppo&s;ed Chri&s;t at his fir&s;t coming in the Fle&s;h, &s;eemed more wi&s;e, and holy, and emi|nent in the Church than the re&s;t, as the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who &s;at in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Chair, and had the outward Letter of the Word in all Exactne&s;s, and the outward Form of Religion in all Strict|ne&s;s; &s;o they, who do, and &s;hall mo&s;t oppo&s;e

<P>And thus you &s;ee, that the fal&s;e Prophets of Anti-chri&s;t &s;hall ari&s;e among Chri&s;tians, and a|mong &s;uch Chri&s;tians as &s;eem to be godly; and among &s;uch &s;eeming godly Chri&s;tians as preach the Word; and among &s;uch Preachers of the Word as &s;eem to be of greater Worth and Emi|nency than the re&s;t: And &s;o in all the&s;e Regards it will be a hard Matter to di&s;cern them.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. By both the&s;e Means (<HI>viz.</HI> their &s;eeming Holine&s;s, and their Intere&s;t with worldly Powers) they exceedingly enlarge their Credit and Repu|tation with the World, and do get Multitudes of People and Nations to entertain them.</P>
<P>For Anti-chri&s;t could not deceive the World with a Company of fooli&s;h, weak, ignorant, pro|phane, contemptible Per&s;ons, but he always hath the greate&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, holie&s;t, and mo&s;t eminent in the vi&s;ible Church for him, and by the&s;e he &s;ed|uces and &s;ubjects to him&s;elf even the whole World.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they that are again&s;t him, and his fal&s;e Prophets, are but a very Handful of Saints,

<P>Wherefore it is a harder Matter to try the&s;e fal&s;e Prophets than we are well aware of. And yet, as hard as it is, the Apo&s;tle, by the Spirit, hath given us a manife&s;t and certain Rule of Trial: And this is the third general Thing I named.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="point">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> THIRD POINT.</HEAD>
<P>To wit, <HI>The &s;ufficient Rule, whereby the true Church may thoroughly try the Spirits and Prophets, how cunningly and &s;ubtilly &s;oever they are di&s;gui&s;|ed;</HI> and this he lays down, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Hereby know we the Spirit of God; every Spi|rit that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is of God. And every Spirit that confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is not of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now this Scripture we may under&s;tand two Ways.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of a right Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his own Per&s;on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of a true Receiving of this Chri&s;t into us by Faith.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>Of the right Knowledge of Chri&s;t in his own Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For whereas he &s;aith, <HI>Every Spirit that con|fe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. This gives us to under&s;tand, that he is true God, and was before he came into the Fle&s;h.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="008578_0020_102F877E36E57780">
2. Whereas he &s;aith, <HI>Every Spirit that con|fe&s;&s;eth that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h;</HI> this gives us to under&s;tand, that he is true Man, our very Brother, Partaker of the &s;ame Fle&s;h and Blood with us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas he &s;aith, <HI>Every Spirit that con|fe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This al&s;o gives us to under&s;tand, that in him, true God and true Man are united into one in&s;e|parable Per&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whereas he &s;aith, <HI>Every Spirit that con|fe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. This gives us Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the End of his Coming; &s;eeing God did not become Man in vain, or for &s;ome &s;light Cau&s;e, but that he might redeem unto God, all tho&s;e whom the Father had elected in him, and &s;ave them perfectly from the Law, Sin, Death and Hell: And hence we may ri&s;e up to conceive of his Offices, <HI>viz.</HI> of his Prie&s;tly, Prophetical and Kingly Office, and of the infinite Virtue and Efficacy of them.</P>
<P>Now he that makes this Confe&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from the Revelation of the Father, is of God; and he that &s;peaks otherwi&s;e, is not of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;econdly, We may under&s;tand this Scripture, not only of the true Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but al&s;o and e&s;pecially of the true Receiving of him by Faith: <HI>Every Spirit</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is of God;</HI> that is, he is of God, that be|lieves and acknowledges that the Son of the liv|ing God is come, not only into that Humanity
<PB N="22" REF="008578_0021_102F87816E7E6B88">of Chri&s;t, that was born of the Virgin, but al&s;o that he is come into us, and dwells in us; accord|ing to the&s;e Scriptures, <HI>That Chri&s;t may dwell in your Hearts by Faith:</HI> And <HI>Chri&s;t in you the Hope of Glory:</HI> And <HI>Know ye not that Chri&s;t is in you, except you be Reprobates,</HI> &amp;c. Wherefore the Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come into his own Fle&s;h, but al&s;o into theirs, which by this Means is made his; and that Chri&s;t is in them, of a Truth, and dwells in them.</P>
<P>For Anti-chri&s;t him&s;elf, and his Mini&s;ters, do all acknowledge, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come into that Fle&s;h, which he did a&s;&s;ume of the Virgin; but they will not confe&s;s, that this is true in him, and in us: They will acknowledge the My&s;tery of God manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h, as to Chri&s;t the Head, but they will deny it as to the Church his Body: And &s;o, whil&s;t they &s;eparate the Head from the Body, and the Body from the Head in this My&s;tery, they do <HI>&s;olvere Je&s;um,</HI> they di&s;&s;olve Je&s;us.</P>
<P>I &s;ay &s;ome hold, that the eternal Word, or divine Nature, came indeed into that Fle&s;h which was born of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, but they will by no Means allow it to come into ours, through our Union with him by Faith: Only they &s;ay, &s;ome created Habits, or Gifts of Grace come in|to us, or in our Fle&s;h, but not Chri&s;t him&s;elf, or the divine Nature, or Son of the living God. And &s;o the&s;e Men &s;et up the&s;e created Gifts and Graces in the Members, in&s;tead of Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, the Head.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="008578_0022_102F8785254100A8">
And yet the&s;e Teachers make a glorious Shew in the Fle&s;h; and this is Anti-chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> when Men think that the&s;e created Habits of Grace (which they fancy) will renew, comfort, &s;anc|tify and &s;ave them; and &s;o do make to them&s;elves of them, a glorious, but yet a fal&s;e Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Wherefore let us know, that he that denies Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Members, is, though not &s;o great, yet as true Anti-chri&s;t, as he that denies Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Head: And he that denies Chri&s;t dwelling in our Hearts by Faith, to be, and to be alone, Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanc|tification and Redemption to us, as he that de|nies him to be the Power, Wi&s;dom, and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Sum of this Matter is this, that the true Spirits or Prophets do acknowledge, not only that Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God, is come into that Son of Man, which was born of the Ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin, but al&s;o that Chri&s;t is come into them, and dwells in them, as in his own true and proper Members.</P>
<P>And &s;o, he that hath Je&s;us Chri&s;t dwelling in his Heart, is a true Prophet; and he that hath not Chri&s;t dwelling in his Heart, is a fal&s;e Pro|phet, though his Knowledge and Religion be never &s;o high, and glorious, and holy al&s;o in the Opinion of the World. And this is the chief Sign and Mark, whereby we may know the true Prophets and true Chri&s;tians, from the fal&s;e Pro|phets and fal&s;e Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Now if any &s;hall &s;ay, but how &s;hall we know whether a Man hath Chri&s;t dwelling
<PB N="24" REF="008578_0023_102F878A61EBBB28">in his Heart or no? And &s;o con&s;equently, whe|ther he be a true or fal&s;e Prophet?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer, you &s;hall certainly know it, by the Truth of the Word of Chri&s;t in him, and by the Truth of the Life of Chri&s;t, in Reference to his Office in the Word.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t then, the true Prophets are to be di&s;|cerned from the fal&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>By the Truth of the Word of God in them.</HI></P>
<P>For the true Prophets &s;peak the true Word of God, even the Word of Wi&s;dom, the Word of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Word of Life, the Word of Power, the Word that is able to &s;ave, which is the true Go&s;pel Word. For this is the Covenant that God hath made with Chri&s;t and his Seed, &s;aying, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lix. 21. <HI>My Spirit which is upon thee, and my Word which is in thy Mouth, &s;hall never de|part out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed, from henceforth and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>And this was perfectly fulfilled in Chri&s;t; for that Word, which in the Beginning was with God, and was God, was made Fle&s;h in him, and dwelt in him; and out of that Word Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;pake all that ever he &s;pake; his whole Doctrine did flow from that eternal Word which dwelt in him.</P>
<P>And Chri&s;t communicated to the Di&s;ciples the &s;ame Word which he had received, as he &s;aith, <HI>John</HI> xvii. 8. <HI>I have given to them the Words that thou gave&s;t me</HI> (that is, the word of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Life) <HI>and they have received them, and have known &s;urely, that I came out from thee, and
<PB N="25" REF="008578_0024_102F878BFB11C7C8">they have believed that thou did&s;t &s;end me;</HI> and &s;o that Word, which they them&s;elves received by Faith, they al&s;o held forth to others, as <HI>John</HI> &s;aith, I <HI>John</HI> i. 4. <HI>That which was from the Be|ginning, which we have heard, which we have &s;een with our Eyes, which we have looked upon, and our Hands have handled, of the Word of Life, declare we unto you.</HI></P>
<P>And to this al&s;o <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> gives Te&s;ti|mony, <HI>John</HI> iii. 34. where he &s;aith, <HI>He whom God hath &s;ent &s;peaketh the Words of God,</HI> not the Words of Men, or Angels, but of God; and this is true, both in Chri&s;t, and in his Seed.</P>
<P>But now the fal&s;e Prophets &s;peak not the Word of God, for they have it not in their Hearts; but what Word they have in their Hearts, that they &s;peak; and &s;o they &s;peak the Words of their own Rea&s;on, Wi&s;dom and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or of other Mens, but beyond human Things they do not go, whether they pretend to high Notions on the one Hand, or to &s;ound orthodox Doctrine on the other Hand.</P>
<P>Now of this true Chri&s;tians are to take &s;pe|cial Notice; becau&s;e, as the true Word of God is the greate&s;t Commodity to the Church that can be, and brings the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, and all the Things of Chri&s;t along with it; &s;o the Word of Man is the greate&s;t Mi&s;chief to the Church that can be; for it brings Anti-chri&s;t, and his Kingdom, and all his Things along with it. And thus doth vain Philo&s;ophy, and School Di|vinity (which is an unlawful mixing of Philo&s;ophy with the outward Letter of the Word) pervert
<PB N="26" REF="008578_0025_102F878F25E31CA8">all Things in the Church of carnal and fal&s;e Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the true Prophets &s;peak the true Word of God, &s;o al&s;o they &s;peak it by the true Spirit of God, and not by their own Spirit: And thus did Chri&s;t, who &s;aith of him&s;elf, <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the Go&s;pel,</HI> and &s;o he &s;pake the Word of God by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>And Chri&s;t commanded his Di&s;ciples to &s;tay at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> till they had received the Spirit, and then to go forth and preach; becau&s;e he knew they could not preach God's Word aright, without God's Spirit; and al&s;o Chri&s;t &s;aith of all the Faithful, that <HI>it is not they that &s;peak, but the Spi|rit of their Father that &s;peaks in them;</HI> year, and the whole Go&s;pel is called, the Mini&s;tration of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Now the true Prophets, &s;peaking the Word of God by and in his Spirit, do al&s;o &s;peak it in the right Sen&s;e, and after the true Mind of Chri&s;t, as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith of him&s;elf, and of other Believers who had received the Spirit, <HI>We have the Mind of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But the fal&s;e Prophets, though they &s;peak the Word of the Letter exactly, and that according|ly to the very Original, and Curio&s;ity of Critici&s;ms, yet &s;peaking it without the Spirit, they are fal&s;e Prophets before God and his true Church; &s;eeing all right Prophecy hath proceeded from the Spirit in all Ages of the World, but e&s;pecia|lly it mu&s;t &s;o proceed in the Days of the New-Te&s;tament, wherein God hath promi&s;ed the larg|e&s;t Effu&s;ion of his Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="008578_0026_102F8794B2B9EA88">
And they, &s;peaking the Word of the Letter without the Spirit, do wholly mi&s;take the Mind of Chri&s;t in all, and under the outward Letter of the Word of God do only bring in the Mind of Man. And this is one of the greate&s;t Delu&s;ions, and mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Snares that can be laid in the Church, to bring in the Word of Chri&s;t without the Mind of Chri&s;t, yea, to bring in the Word of Chri&s;t, again&s;t the Mind of Chri&s;t, and according to the Mind of Anti-chri&s;t: This is the effectual Operation of Error, whereby all Hypocrites and fal&s;e Chri&s;tians are deceived, and that without all Hope of Recovery.</P>
<P>And thus you &s;ee, that the true Prophets bring the true Word, and bring it al&s;o by the true Spi|rit, and this manife&s;ts them to be of God; but the fal&s;e, either bring not the true Word, or if they bring the Word in the Letter, yet they bring it without the Spirit, and thus it is manife&s;t, they are not of God.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But &s;ome will object here; if a Man preach the Word in the Letter, even good, &s;ound and orthodox Doctrine, no Doubt but &s;uch a Man is to be heard, and he may do much Good in the Church, though he wants Chri&s;t's Spirit: This I have heard from very many, who have though they have &s;aid &s;omething,</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But to this I an&s;wer, That they who want Chri&s;t's Spirit, which is the Spirit of Pro|phecy, though they preach the exact Letter of the Word, yet are fal&s;e Prophets, and not to be heard by the Sheep.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="28" REF="008578_0027_102F8796811BA930">
1. Becau&s;e, under the New-Te&s;tament, we are not to regard the Letter without the Spirit, but the Spirit as well as the Letter; yea, the Spirit more than the Letter: And therefore <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, that Chri&s;t &s;hall de&s;troy Anti-chri&s;t with the <HI>Spi|rit of his Mouth, and the Brightne&s;s of his coming:</HI> He &s;carce takes any Notice of the Letter, but calls the true Preaching of the Go&s;pel, the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t's Mouth, or the Mini&s;tration of the Spirit. And therefore the &s;piritual People can|not join to that Mini&s;try, where the Spirit of Chri&s;t is wanting, though there be the outward Letter of the Word in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that preach only the outward Letter of the Word without the true Spirit, they make all Things outward in the Church, and &s;o carry the People, with whom they prevail, only to outward Things, to an outward Word, to out|ward Wor&s;hip, outward Ordinances, outward Church, outward Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas, in the true Kingdom of Chri&s;t, all Things are inward and &s;piritual, and all the true Religion of Chri&s;t is written in the Soul and Spirit of Man, by the Spirit of God; and the Believer is the only Book, in which God him&s;elf writes his New-Te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. They who preach the outward Letter of the Word, though never &s;o truly, without the Spirit, do (as hath been &s;aid) wholly mi&s;take the Mind of Chri&s;t in the Word for want of the Spirit, which is the only true and infallible Inter|preter of his Mind; and &s;o under the outward Letter of the Word, preach their own Mind,
<PB N="29" REF="008578_0028_102F879819725010">and not Chri&s;t's Mind; and do make all the Scriptures &s;erve their own Turns, even their own wordly Ends and Advantages, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. They that preach the outward Letter of the Word without the Spirit, can, with &s;uch a Word, both live them&s;elves in all the inward Evils of corrupted Nature, and allow others to do &s;o too. And thus the Go&s;pel, which, in the Spirit of it, is the Judgment of Sin, is made, in the Letter of it, the Covering for Sin, and the Encourager of it; &s;eeing &s;uch Men, who have the Letter of the Word in their Mouth, do live, in the inward Corruptions of their Hearts, more &s;ecurely and quietly than other Men.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;t of all, let us know, that whoever doth agree with Chri&s;t never &s;o exactly in the Letter, and yet differs from him in Spirit, is a very Anti-chri&s;t.

<P>And &s;o, as Chri&s;t builds up his Church by his Spirit through his Word; &s;o Anti-chri&s;t builds up his Church by the Word without the Spirit: And Chri&s;t's Church and Anti-chri&s;t's do often differ very little or nothing in Word or Letter, yet do always infinitely differ in Spirit.</P>

Wherefore to conclude, let us know, that that Church that hath the Word, if it wants the Spirit, is Anti-chri&s;t's Church; and that that Mi|ni&s;try that u&s;eth the Word, and wants the Spirit, is Anti-chri&s;t's Mini&s;try; and that all Works, Duties, Prayings, Preaching, Fa&s;ting, Thank&s;|giving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without Chri&s;t's Spirit, are nothing but the very Kingdom of Anti-chri&s;t, and the Abomination of De&s;olation.</P>

<P><HI>The fir&s;t Sign then, whereby the true Prophets may be di&s;cerned from the fal&s;e, is this,</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the true Prophets are all &s;ent of God. So was Mo&s;es whom God &s;ent to the Children of
<PB N="31" REF="008578_0030_102F879DD161A560"><HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and bid him tell them, that <HI>I AM, even the God of</HI> Abraham, I&s;aac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>hath &s;ent him to them;</HI> and he gave him a porportionable Mea&s;ure of his Pre&s;ence, to cau&s;e them to believe it. And Chri&s;t, a greater Prophet than <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> even the Head of all the Children of God, &s;aid by <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> xlviii. 16. <HI>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not &s;poken in &s;ecret from the Be|ginning, and now the Lord and his Spirit hath &s;ent me.</HI> And every where in the Go&s;pel, he &s;till de|clares, how <HI>be came not of him&s;elf, but his Father &s;ent him.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Father &s;ent Chri&s;t, &s;o Chri&s;t &s;ends all his Seed, the true Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as is manife&s;t, <HI>John</HI> xx. 21. where Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>As my Father &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you;</HI> which he &s;pake not only touching them, but touching all that &s;hould believe in his Name through their Word: And <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o &s;aith. <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 15. <HI>How &s;hall they teach except they be &s;end?</HI> So that true Preaching comes from true &s;ending, and this comes from the Grace of God.</P>
<P>Now I de&s;ire you farther to take Notice, that God hath reckoned the Choice of his Mini&s;ters, one of the weightie&s;t Things that belong unto his Kingdom; wherefore he would never com|mit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ru&s;t of this to any Sort of Men what|&s;oever. Yea, Chri&s;t him&s;elf did not choo&s;e his Di&s;ciples at his own human Will, but only at the Will of God, and therefore was much in Prayer before he cho&s;e them.</P>
<P>And the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves dur&s;t not of them|&s;elves, when they were all met together, choo&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="008578_0031_102F87A2051ECE68">any one into the Room of <HI>Judas,</HI> but they be|took them&s;elves to Prayer, and de&s;ired the Lord to &s;hew whom he had cho&s;en. And <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. the Spirit &s;aid, <HI>Separate me</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul <HI>for the Work whereunto I have called them.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> tells the <HI>Galatians,</HI> that he was an Apo&s;tle, <HI>not of Men, nor by Men, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father.</HI></P>
<P>By all which Scriptures we may perceive what Care the Lord hath always had, to &s;end his own Mini&s;ters him&s;elf into his own Church, and would have his true Church receive no Mini&s;ters but &s;uch as he &s;ends them.</P>
<P>And the great and chief Sending into the Church is from God him&s;elf, as we &s;ee in <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and all the Prophets, and in Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the Head of them, and in all the Apo&s;tles, and in all Believers.</P>
<P>Now the Proof of a Man's &s;ending from God is this, to be anointed with the Spirit; as <HI>John</HI> xx. 22. when Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>As my Father &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you, he breathed upon them, and &s;aid, receive the holy Spirit:</HI> For his Father &s;ent him only by pouring out his Spirit on him; and he &s;ends them &s;o only; and he that &s;aith, <HI>The Unction of the Spirit alone is not &s;ufficient for the Mini&s;try of the New-Te&s;tament,</HI> he denies Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles to have been &s;ufficient Mini&s;ters, and he perverts the Scripture, and &s;educes the People.</P>
<P>Now the true Teachers, through the pouring forth of the Spirit on them, they do truly know Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and the great My&s;tery of the Go&s;|pel,
<PB N="33" REF="008578_0032_102F87A39BDF0280">and all the Things that are freely given us of God; and they are al&s;o filled with Love to their Brothren, and are enabled to confe&s;s the Truth, and to do thereafter, and to contemn the World, and patiently to &s;uffer Rebukes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which is a &s;ufficient Proof of any One's &s;ending from God.</P>
<P>And thus the true Prophets are all &s;ent of God, which is their great Comfort and Support in all Trouble and Difficulties, becau&s;e <HI>he that &s;ends them, is &s;till with them. Lo</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>I am with you always, to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>But now, on the contrary, the fal&s;e Prophets and Mini&s;ters of Anti-Chri&s;t are not &s;ent of God, but are &s;ent and appointed by Men, and that thro' their own De&s;ire and Seeking. And of &s;uch the Lord complains, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 21. <HI>I have not &s;ent the&s;e Prophets, yet they ran; I have not &s;poken to them, yet they prophe&s;ied:</HI> But <HI>becau&s;e I &s;ent them not, neither commanded them, they &s;hall not profit this People at all, &s;aith the Lord,</HI> Ver&s;e 32.</P>
<P>And Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Many fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e Prophets, &s;hall ari&s;e; i. e.</HI> are not &s;ent of God, but &s;hall ari&s;e of them&s;elves. And <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith to the Elders of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us, Acts</HI> xx. <HI>Out of your&s;elves &s;hall Men ari&s;e, &s;peaking perver&s;e Things, to draw Di&s;ciples after them.</HI> They ari&s;e of them&s;elves, they are not &s;ent of God.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch Teachers as the&s;e do u&s;ually &s;pring up in the Church, through academical Degrees, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ordination; which two Things have poured forth into the Church whole Swarms of fal&s;e Prophets, and Anti-chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters,

<P>Wherefore all tho&s;e Teachers who are not &s;ent of the Lord and his Spirit, but ari&s;e of them|&s;elves, and come into the Church in the Strength and Might of their Degrees and Orders, they are all fal&s;e Prophets.</P>

And &s;o al&s;o our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Days of his Fle&s;h, how bold was he in his Mini&s;try, coming in the Name of the Lord, and having his Authority and Doctrine from him! How boldly did he reprove the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, the chief Teachers of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church! And what a clear and glorious Confe&s;&s;ion of the Truth of God, did he hold forth again&s;t all their Oppo&s;i|tion and Contradiction?</P>

<P>The Apo&s;tles al&s;o of the Lord, after they had received the Spirit, did go up and down the World, only preaching Je&s;us, and Repentance, and Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins in his Name.</P>

<P>Thus Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples, out of the Love of God; as he &s;aith, <HI>I delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my Heart;</HI> that is, his Love to God.

<P>And as he taught out of Love him&s;elf, &s;o he hath commanded all his Seed to teach one ano|ther out of the &s;ame Love, and hath given them his Spirit, which is Love, that thereby they might love both him, and their Brethren; and therefore Chri&s;t (knowing how difficult a Work it was, to feed his Sheep with the right and &s;ound Doctrine of the Go&s;pel; and that none could or would perform this, except they loved Chri&s;t from their very Heart Root) &s;aid thrice to <HI>Peter, Peter, do&s;t thou love me?

<P>And as Chri&s;t him&s;elf did not &s;ell his &s;piritual Travel to his Church, for worldly Profit or Gain; no more do his true Seed and Servants; for &s;aith <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts xx. 33. <HI>I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel; yea, your&s;elves know, that the&s;e Hands have mini&s;tered to my Nece&s;&s;ity, and to them who were with me:</HI> And 2 Cor. xii. 14. <HI>Be|hold the third Time I am ready to come to you, I will not be burden&s;ome to you, for I &s;eek not yours, but you.</HI> And Ver&s;e 17. <HI>Did I make a Gain of you, by any of them whom I &s;ent unto you?

<P>And thus the true Teachers do not &s;eek any temporal Gain or Commodity, from the Hands of Men, by their preaching, but do truly and cheerfully teach out of the Love of Chri&s;t, and their Brother.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, the fal&s;e Teachers, tho' they do not teach the Go&s;pel (being de&s;titute of the Spirit) but vain Philo&s;ophy and human Doc|trines in&s;tead of it, yet will they live by the Go|&s;pel, and not by the Labour of their Hands, in a lawful Calling; they will have the temporal Goods of the Church, and yet not mini&s;ter the &s;piritual Trea&s;ure of it; and what they do mini|&s;ter they do it for Reward, as it is written, <HI>Mi|cah</HI> iii. 11. <HI>The Prie&s;ts teach for Hire, and the Prophets divine for Money; and he that putteth not into their Mouths, they even prepare War again&s;t him.</HI></P>

<P>In a Word, they preach all Things in a plea|&s;ing Spirit to the World, that they by all may get Glory to them&s;elves, and may be accounted, with <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> &s;ome great Ones. And in all this, they &s;hew they &s;peak of them&s;elves, and not of God; &s;eeing they &s;eek not God's Glory, but their own; for, <HI>He that &s;peaketh of him&s;elf, &s;eeketh his own Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore they who by their Mini&s;try do not &s;eek the Glory of God alone, and of his Son Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, but &s;eek their own Glory, and the Prai&s;e of Men, as the Clergy generally do, and not lea&s;t of all in this Place, they are all of them fal&s;e Prophets, and Mini&s;ters of Anti-chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The true Preachers and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, when they are oppo&s;ed, re&s;i&s;ted, &s;landered and per&s;ecuted for the Word's Sake, they endure it with all Meekne&s;s, Humility and Patience. Thus Chri&s;t endured all the Reproaches, Contradic|tions, Revilings, and Per&s;ecutions from the <HI>Jew;</HI> and <HI>when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he &s;uffered, he threatened not, but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 23. And <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith of him&s;elf to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 12. <HI>You had the Signs of my Apo&s;tle&s;hip in all Patience.</HI></P>
<P>But, on the contrary, the fal&s;e Teachers, when any Truth is preached that they know not, or
<PB N="44" REF="008578_0043_102F87C613B48E40">that is again&s;t their Gain or Glory, they &s;narl and bark at it, and bite them that bring it. And therefore &s;aith <HI>Paul, Beware of Dogs,</HI> Phil. iii. 2. not Dogs by Nature, but by Practice and Condi|tion. Now a cur&s;t Dog, lying on a rich Garment, or &s;oft Carpet, at his Ea&s;e, as long as he may lie &s;till he is very quiet, but if you would remove him from his Place, he &s;oon &s;narls and flies at you, and &s;hews of what Mettle he is made. So the fal&s;e Teachers, who have gotten a carnal Knowledge of the Word, and have thereby got|ten Preferment, and great Advantages in the World, they lie quiet on the&s;e &s;oft Things, as long as they may lie &s;till; but if any &s;eek by the Word of God to rouze them up from the&s;e Things, they ri&s;e up like angry Dogs, and bark at them, and rend them, as much as they can or dare.</P>
<P>Wherefore tho&s;e Teachers who cannot patient|ly &s;uffer Wrongs for the Word's Sake, but, on the contrary, when they are reproved by the Word, and their Sheeps Clothing pulled off, even their fal&s;e Vizard of Religion, do pre&s;ently grow im|patient and furious; and they that bark and foam again&s;t the late revealed Truth, which toucheth them very near, they all are fal&s;e Teachers, and Mini&s;ters of Anti-chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The true Prophets, and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, do not force any Body to hear them, and obey their Doctrine again&s;t their Wills, neither do they vex and trouble them with &s;ecular Power,
<PB N="45" REF="008578_0044_102F87C7E825FFF8">who will not obey them, and be &s;ubject to them; but they leave all &s;uch People as they found them, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem by their Doctrine to &s;eek any worldly Thing.</P>
<P>Thus Chri&s;t when he taught the Go&s;pel, &s;till cried out, <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear;</HI> and he that had not Ears to hear, he did not pu|ni&s;h him: And again &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>If any Man with be my Di&s;ciple, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, and follow me;</HI> and &s;till left Men to their own Freedom, whether they would be his Di&s;ciples or no.</P>
<P>And as Chri&s;t did thus him&s;elf, &s;o he left the &s;ame Thing in Command with all his true Di&s;|ciples; and when he &s;ent them forth to preach, <HI>Matthew</HI> x, he charged them, &s;aying, <HI>Whoever will not receive you, nor hear your Words, when you depart out of that Hou&s;e or City, &s;hake off the Du&s;t of your Feet, as a Te&s;timony again&s;t them;</HI> he doth not bid them, if they be refu&s;ed, to be|take them&s;elves to the &s;ecular Power, to get Au|thority from thence to &s;tay and abide there, whe|ther they will or no, or otherwi&s;e to puni&s;h them, but bids them only to <HI>&s;hake off the Du&s;t of their Feet,</HI> that they might know, they came not to them for the Love of earthly Things. And when the Apo&s;tles, out of a fal&s;e Zeal, would have had Chri&s;t to have commanded Fire to have come down from Heaven to have de&s;troyed them that would not receive him, he plainly reproved them, &s;aying, <HI>Ye know not of what Spirit ye are; for the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy Mens Lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="008578_0045_102F87CFBAFB51C8">
It is recorded in the Life of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Jude</HI> the Apo&s;tles, as both <HI>Gullelmus de Sancto Amore,</HI> and <HI>John Hus</HI> relate, that when the chief Ruler was very angry with tho&s;e who defamed the Doc|trine of tho&s;e Apo&s;tles, and in great Zeal com|manded a great Fire to be made, that &s;uch Op|po&s;ers might be ca&s;t into it, the Apo&s;tles fell down before the Emperor, &s;aying, <HI>We be&s;eech you (Sir) let not us be the Authors or Cau&s;ers of this De&s;truction, who are come to publi&s;h the Doctrine of eternal Salvation; neither let us who are &s;ent to revive tho&s;e who are dead through Sin, become the Killers of tho&s;e who are alive.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore tho&s;e Teachers who, for worldly Advantage Sake, will force them&s;elves upon tho&s;e Men again&s;t their Wills, who will not willingly receive them; and will provoke the worldly Pow|ers and Magi&s;trates to puni&s;h tho&s;e who will not hear and receive them and their Doctrine, they all are fal&s;e Prophets and Mini&s;ters of Anti-chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The true Teachers are content that others &s;hould teach as well as they, and would not make a Monopoly of the Mini&s;try to them&s;elves alone, for worldly Advantage Sake.</P>
<P>Thus our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not content him&s;elf to preach the Go&s;pel alone, but he &s;ent forth others, as his Father &s;ent forth him, yea, he pours forth his Spirit on all Fle&s;h, that Sons and Daughters, and Servants, and Handmaids may prophe&s;y, and &s;o Knowledge may cover the
<PB N="47" REF="008578_0046_102F87D15AA05478">Earth, as Waters the Seas: And to make the World willing to receive &s;uch Teachers, he &s;aith, <HI>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that &s;ent me.</HI></P>
<P>And when <HI>Eldad</HI> and <HI>Medad,</HI> upon whom the Spirit of the Lord did re&s;t, did prophe&s;y in the Camp of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> without a&s;king any Licence from <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and one told <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of it in great Di&s;plea|&s;ure, and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> thereupon wi&s;hed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to for|bid them to prophe&s;y, then <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the meek Ser|vant of the Lord, replied, <HI>Envie&s;t thou for my Sake, would God</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>that all the Lord's People were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them all,</HI> Numb. xi. 29. And &s;o the godly Mind of any faithful Teacher, de&s;ireth to be helped in the Work of the Word, that the precious Truth of the Go&s;pel, which he him|&s;elf alone cannot &s;ufficiently expre&s;s, all Mens Tongues might declare. And &s;o they do not en|vy in others tho&s;e &s;piritual Gifts which God hath given them, but do wi&s;h, that every Man had a Mouth and Wi&s;dom given him, to declare the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, and the infinite Love, Mercy, Wi&s;dom, Truth, Power, Redemption, and Salvation of God, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which can|not by all Mens Tongues be &s;ufficiently publi&s;hed in the World.</P>
<P>Farther, as no worldly Prince or Magi&s;trate hath &s;uch unlimited Power over the Goods of the People, as to forbid them to give corporal Alms to them that &s;tand in Need, as Occa&s;ion is mi|ni&s;tered; no more hath any Power, whether ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, &s;uch Dominion over the
<PB N="48" REF="008578_0047_102F87D3047F0BF8">Word and Truth of God, written by the Spirit in the Hearts of Believers, but that they may at all Times, and upon all Occa&s;ions, mini&s;ter &s;pi|ritual Alms to them who &s;tand in Need, by the teaching of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Wherefore tho&s;e Teachers, who are envious that any &s;hould preach the Word but them&s;elves, and their own Tribe, as they call it (becau&s;e they get great worldly Advantage thereby, whereas otherwi&s;e they would be contented that any &s;hould preach) and &s;o would have the civil Ma|gi&s;trate only to licence them to be Preachers be|cau&s;e of their Degrees and Orders, and to forbid all others, they all are fal&s;e Teachers, and Mini|&s;ters of Anti-chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The true Teachers do not only teach the Word, but are al&s;o ready to &s;eal to the Truth of it, with their E&s;tates, Liberties and Lives.</P>
<P>Thus did Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as was foretold by <HI>I&s;a|iah,</HI> Chap. 1. 5. where Chri&s;t &s;aith by his Spirit, <HI>The Lord hath opened mine Ear, and I was not re|bellious, neither turned away back; I gave my Back to the Smiters, and my Cheeks to them who plucked off the Hair; I hid not my Face from Shame and Spitting.</HI> And in the Days of his Fle&s;h, how willingly did he &s;eal to the Truth of his New-Te|&s;tament Doctrine with his Suffering, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be apprehended by the Hands of Men, and to be crucified, when he could have com|manded Legions of Angels for his Succour, if he
<PB N="49" REF="008578_0048_102F87D62983B368">had plea&s;ed, and would not have made u&s;e of his own Infinite and Almighty Power.</P>
<P>And this Submi&s;&s;ion and Willingne&s;s to &s;uffer for the Truth, Chri&s;t hath commanded all his Di&s;ciples, &s;aying, <HI>He that will &s;ave his Life, &s;hall lo&s;e it; and he that will lo&s;e his Life for my Sake &s;hall &s;ave it:</HI> And <HI>if any Man will be my Di&s;|ciple, let him deny him&s;elf, take up the Cro&s;s, and follow me:</HI> And again, <HI>I &s;end you forth as Sheep among Wolves, and ye &s;hall be brought before Kings and Rulers for my Name's Sake,</HI> that is, for the true and &s;piritual Teaching of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Now as nothing will procure us more Enmity, than the &s;piritual holding forth of the Go&s;pel, which will cau&s;e the worldly Church to ca&s;t out our Name as evil, and to ca&s;t our Per&s;ons out of their Synagogues, yea, and al&s;o to kill us, when they can get Power; &s;o, if we be true Teachers, mu&s;t we be ready and willing to &s;uffer all this for Chri&s;t's Name's Sake.</P>
<P>Wherefore tho&s;e Teachers who embrace the Heighth and Honour of this Life, and will not own the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, farther than they may thereby procure to them&s;elves Credit, Reputa|tion, Profit, and Preferment in World; and to this End, in doubtful and difficult Times, car|ry them&s;elves &s;o &s;ubtilly, that whatever Party &s;hall prevail, they may &s;till &s;tand on their Legs, and enjoy their pre&s;ent Pro&s;perity and Prefer|ment, and &s;o are neither hot nor cold, neither truly for the Truth, nor openly again&s;t the Truth, but &s;eek by all &s;ubtil Means to decline the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. And though in Chri&s;t him&s;elf, they
<PB N="50" REF="008578_0049_102F740BC77C5220">prai&s;e his Meanne&s;s, Plaine&s;s, Simplicity, Suf|fering, and Cro&s;s, yet they them&s;elves are deli|cate, and cannot endure the&s;e Things for Chri&s;t's Sake in them&s;elves, but bend and frame the whole Cour&s;e of their Mini&s;try &s;o, as they may obtain all good Things from the World, and avoid and e&s;cape all evil Things from it; the&s;e all are fal&s;e Prophets, and Mini&s;ters of Anti-chri&s;t.</P>
<P>By the&s;e nine Signs (for I &s;hall name no more now) may the true Prophets and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t be manife&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed and di&s;cerned from the fal&s;e Ones of Anti-chri&s;t, by all the true People of God, who have received his Spi|rit.</P>
<P>Now let God and his Word be true, and eve|ry Man a Liar.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall make but two U&s;es of this Di&s;cour&s;e briefly, and &s;o conclude for this Time. And the fir&s;t &s;hall be to tho&s;e of you, who are &s;piritual Chri&s;tians; and the &s;econd to the carnal Clergy.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> You who are true Believers, and &s;piri|tual Chri&s;tians, may judge aright, by what you have heard, of the pre&s;ent Clergy, or common Mini&s;try of the Nation; and may &s;ee, by the clear Light of the Word, that they, for the Genera|lity of them, are not true, but fal&s;e Prophets; not the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, but of Anti-chri&s;t; not &s;ent of God, nor anointed by his Spirit, but ordained and appointed by Men, at their own De&s;ire and Seeking, for worldly Advantage Sake; Men who &s;tand and mini&s;ter in the Church, on|ly in the Strength of their academical Degrees,
<PB N="51" REF="008578_0050_102F8717B87F2A50">and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ordination, but do not &s;tand and feed the People in the Strength of the Lord, and in the Maje&s;ty of the Name of their God. And this corrupt Mini&s;try, or carnal Clergy, have deceived the People and Nations, with a corrupt and carnal Under&s;tanding of Chri&s;t, and of the Scriptures, and of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of the Government of his Kingdom, and of all the Things of Chri&s;t: Yea, they have, under the Name and Pretence of Chri&s;t, &s;et up a Church to Anti-chri&s;t every where, and do continually mi&s;lead Thou&s;ands of poor Souls, and carry them Captive to Hell, and that under the Colour and Pretence of Religion.</P>
<P>And this, I &s;ay, is the great Evil in the&s;e fal&s;e Teachers, that, under the Name of Chri&s;t, they fight again&s;t Chri&s;t, and under the Name of the Word, they fight again&s;t the Word, and under the Name of the Church, they fight again&s;t the Church: And this is a grievous Abomination of De&s;olation in the Temple of God, that they who &s;hould be the Chief for the Truth, are the Chief again&s;t it; and that they who &s;hould be faithful Witne&s;&s;es to the holy Truth of Chri&s;t, &s;hould prove lying Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t it. If a prophane Per&s;on, or Heathen, &s;hould do this, it would be Wickedne&s;s and Impiety even in them; but this is horrible Abomination, and Anti-chri&s;tiani&s;m in the Church of Chri&s;t; that they, who are come into it as Friends, and have obtained the chief Places in it, &s;hould yet, under this Vizard, be in|deed very Enemies, and Seducers, and Hinderers of the Word of Chri&s;t crucified. Wherefore,
<PB N="52" REF="008578_0051_102F871D92DF4C80">&s;aith the Truth again&s;t &s;uch, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lv. 12. <HI>It was not an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that mag|nified him&s;elf again&s;t me, for then I would have hid my&s;elf from him; but it was thou, a Man, mine Equal, my Guide, and my Acquaintance; we took &s;weet Coun&s;el together, and walked unto the Hou&s;e of God in Company,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And &s;o the&s;e fal&s;e Teachers are the&s;e familiar Enemies, who exerci&s;e all their Hatred under the Pretence of Love, all their Enmity under Pre|tence of Friend&s;hip, and practi&s;e all their Wick|edne&s;s under a Form of Godline&s;s; and by this Subtilty have they deceived the World. They will not plainly contradict the Words of the Pro|phets, Apo&s;tles and Chri&s;t, in the Letter of it, but will pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">, and &s;peak well of it; but yet they are utter Enemies to the true and &s;piritual Meaning of it, both in their Lives and Doctrine: And the more the&s;e Men make a Shew of Reli|gion and Holine&s;s, the greater Anti-chri&s;ts they be in the Church.</P>
<P>Wherefore to you who are true Chri&s;tians, and have received an Anointing from God, this is the Word and Charge of God, <HI>Come out from among them, my People, and touch not the unclean Thing;</HI> that is, their carnal Doctrine; have no|thing to do with &s;uch Prophets and Mini&s;ters, but remember what Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>John</HI> x. that <HI>his Sheep hear his Voice, and will not hear the Voice of Strangers; for they know the Voice of Strangers.</HI> And if any of you live in any Town or Pari&s;h, where &s;uch fal&s;e Prophets are, though they go
<PB N="53" REF="008578_0052_102F8721B08FA400">under the Name of Godly and Orthodox, yet touch not the unclean Things; but know, that it is better for you Believers to a&s;&s;emble together among your&s;elves, though you be but few, than to communicate with the fal&s;e Prophets in their fal&s;e Ordinances; &s;eeing Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed his Pre&s;ence to his Believers, even where but <HI>two or three meet together in his Name;</HI> yea, he hath &s;aid, <HI>If any two of you &s;hall agree together to a&s;k any Thing on Earth, it &s;hall be done of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And if you, having the&s;e Promi|&s;es, &s;hall meet together among your&s;elves, in the Name and Spirit of Chri&s;t, in the U&s;e of the Word and Prayer of Faith, lo Chri&s;t him&s;elf will be with you; and though you be but few, yet are you the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth, and of that very Church, again&s;t which the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail. And thus much to you &s;piritual Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="2">2. And now for the carnal Clergy, or fal&s;e Prophets, their Burden is this from the Lord. You have run when you were not &s;ent; you have &s;aid, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> when the Lord hath not &s;poken by you; you have grieved the Hearts of the Faithful, and &s;trengthened the Hands of the Wicked; you have been forward to advance the Form of Godline&s;s, whil&s;t you have been bit|ter Enemies to the Power of it; you have de|ceived the Nations, and made them drunk with the Cup of the Wine of your Fornications; you have done more again&s;t Chri&s;t and his true Church, and more for Anti-chri&s;t and his fal&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="008578_0053_102F87250B55D330">Church, than all the People in the&s;e Nations be|&s;ides. Wherefore this is the Word of the Lord God to you, throughout all your Quarters, that the Nations &s;hall not much longer be deceived by you, nor buy any more of your Merchandize; for your Wine is the Poi&s;on of Dragons, and the cruel Venom of A&s;ps; your Doctrine being the Word of Philo&s;ophy, and not of Faith; after the Mind of Man, but contrary to Chri&s;t's Mind; to &s;et up your&s;elves, and your own Intere&s;t, to the Prejudice of Chri&s;t's Word and People. Where|fore, how much you have glorified your&s;elves, and lived deliciou&s;ly by this Trade, of making Mer|chandize of the Word of God, &s;o much Tor|ment and Sorrow &s;hall God give you, and your Plagues &s;hall come upon you in a Day, and your Judgment in an Hour; and your Lovers &s;hall not be able to help you, nor the Petitioners for you, to uphold you; but God &s;hall bring you down wonderfully, by the clear Light of his Word, and his mighty and unre&s;i&s;table Provi|dence accompanying it; and the World &s;hall tremble and wonder at the Noi&s;e of your Down|fal; and the Heavens, and holy Apo&s;tles, and Prophets, &s;hall rejoice over you, when God &s;hall avenge their Cau&s;e upon you. And the Lord will &s;ave his Flock; and they &s;hall be no more a Prey to you, neither &s;hall you any more &s;erve your&s;elves of them. And he will &s;et up one Shepherd over them, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and he &s;hall feed them, and be their Shepherd. And till the&s;e Things be fully brought to pa&s;s, you &s;hall be cloathed with Trembling, when you
<PB N="55" REF="008578_0054_102F872750E64B40">&s;hall perceive the Lord is ri&s;en up to perform all the&s;e Things, according to his Word.</P>
<P>And now for Conclu&s;ion, if any of you, or mo&s;t of you, or all of you, are offended at the&s;e Things, in &s;uch Sort, that you cannot contain your&s;elves from Anger and bitter Zeal, I do in|treat you to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, how much bet|ter, and more profitable to your eternal Salvation it would be, for you to re&s;i&s;t and to refrain from &s;uch Evil and unchri&s;tian Pa&s;&s;ions, and that you would rather (if there be any Hope) return to your own Hearts, and try your Works, and re|pent before our holy and righteous Lord, and re|turn truly and &s;peedily to Chri&s;t from Anti-chri&s;t, le&s;t you be inwrapped both in his temporal and eternal De&s;truction.</P>
<P>And thus much was delivered to the Univer|&s;ity Congregation in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> for a Te&s;timony again&s;t them, except they repent.</P>
