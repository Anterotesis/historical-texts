<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>AS the following &s;hort Treati&s;e was ha&s;tily wrote, it may probably appear incorrect to the judicious; but as the De&s;ign was to repre&s;ent the Value and Importance of the Nor|thern Colonies to this Kingdom, I hope it will an&s;wer my Inten|tions of promoting the public Good.</P>
<P>Their Trade and Produce have not hitherto been properly encouraged, altho' their Utility may be ea&s;ily comprehended; a &s;mall Bounty on the &s;everal rough Materials they are capable of rai&s;ing, and &s;hipping <HI>Home,</HI> would &s;oon enable them to &s;up|ply the Nation with a Variety of Articles, in Return for its Manufactures, which are now purcha&s;ed of Foreigners with <HI>Ca&s;h,</HI> and imported in their <HI>Ships.</HI></P>
<P>The Settling of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> will in a few Years render the pre&s;ent Inhabitants indu&s;trious and u&s;eful, whereby it may be ju&s;tly accounted a mo&s;t valuable Acqui&s;ition, which will be the more con&s;iderable, as the Conditions of its Settlement may be &s;o advantageou&s;ly calculated as to fill it without draining our Mother Country of its Inhabitants. For this Purpo&s;e I have de&s;cribed the Soil, Quality, and Manner of improving the &s;everal Parts of it from my own Ob&s;ervation, whereby it will appear how ea&s;ily it may be effected at a very &s;mall Charge, compared with the Benefits that will naturally re&s;ult from it.&mdash; But if they were doubtful, yet the Advantages the <HI>French</HI> might otherwi&s;e make of this Province, and the Want of an effectual Barrier for &s;ecuring the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Trade, and Fi&s;hery of the Northern Colonies again&s;t their Efforts in a future War, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the Nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing it out of their Hands, without being diverted by the Con|&s;ideration
<PB N="vi" REF="006346_0004_1028A95342811148">of the Expence; and this is the more obvious, and important, as they will always be expo&s;ed to the Attacks of the <HI>French,</HI> from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Cape Breton.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here beg the Reader's Indulgence for &s;aying a Word in Support of my Remarks on that <HI>I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that a high Opinion has been conceived of its Worth, and with good Rea&s;on, from the concurrent Accounts of both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Writers; but as the former have been principally copied from the latter, their Veracity may be fairly called in Que&s;tion: This I have a Right to do, from the exacte&s;t Information I could obtain on the <HI>Spot,</HI> and I can &s;afely appeal to the mo&s;t intelligent Per&s;ons, who have re|&s;ided there long enough to make proper Ob&s;ervations, to con|firm what I have advanced.</P>
<P>By fortifying <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> by encouraging the Importa|tion of its Produce to be wrought up here, and promoting the Fi&s;hery in Time of Peace; by &s;tationing a proper Naval Force there, and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England</HI> in Time of War, this Kingdom may &s;ecure to it&s;elf all the Advantages that could have aro&s;e from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> at a le&s;s Expence than would have been requi&s;ite for keeping &s;o large a <HI>Fortre&s;s</HI> in Repair, and defending it with a pro|per Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Settling of the <HI>Cape Sable</HI> Shore, will undoubtedly make a Winter's Cod-Fi&s;hery practicable, and may &s;oon become more con&s;iderable than any that has ever been pro&s;ecuted, and as the Fi&s;h caught and cured in that Sea&s;on exceeds all others, they will of cour&s;e come to a better Market in all Parts of the World.</P>

<HEAD>THE STATE OF THE <HI>North-American</HI> Trade and Settlements, con&s;idered; With a particular ACCOUNT of NOVA SCOTIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GREAT-BRITAIN</HI> has enjoyed the Bene|fit of a mo&s;t exten&s;ive Commerce, &s;ince the Di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> which, if properly at|tended to, will contribute more to its future Intere&s;t, than any other Branches of Trade, by enlarging the Demand for all its Manufactures, and increa&s;ing the Means of its Naval Force.</P>
<P>That the Riches and Strength of this Nation depend principally on its Commerce with foreign Countries, and its own Colonies, is a Fact that needs no Illu&s;tration; it being equally true in Regard to all trading Kingdoms; for the Increa&s;e of Wealth and Power has generally been proportionate to the Englargement of their Trade, and
<PB REF="006346_0006_1028A954DCEC3C60">Hi&s;tory fully proves, that Ruin and De&s;olation have al|ways attended the Lo&s;s of it; the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing are in|debted to it for their Grandeur, and the mo&s;t opulent and powerful have been undone by the Neglect of it.</P>
<P>As every State in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eems de&s;irous of increa&s;ing its Trade, and the Acqui&s;ition of Wealth enlarges the Means of Power, it is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pre&s;erve an Equality with them, that this Kingdom extends its Com|merce in proportion; but to acquire a Superiority, due Encouragement ought to be given to &s;uch of its Branches, as will mo&s;t effectually enrich its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>As Trade enables the Subject to &s;upport the Admini|&s;tration of Government, the le&s;&s;ening or de&s;troying that of a Rival, has the &s;ame effect, as if this Kingdom had enlarged the Sources of its own Wealth; it is evident from hence, that it is not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the Credit of a Country with its Neighbours, that its Commerce be enlarged only, unle&s;s its Increa&s;e be proportionate to theirs: But, as an A&s;cendency is to be gained by checking the Growth of theirs, as well as by the Increa&s;e of our own, whenever one of the&s;e happens to be the Con&s;equence of the other to this Nation, its Figure and Reputation will ri&s;e to a greater Height than ever.</P>
<P>My Purpo&s;e being to &s;hew how &s;ar the&s;e good Effects may be produced by encouraging the <HI>North American</HI> Trade and Settlements, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e Branches which are capable of the greate&s;t Improvement.</P>
<P>That <HI>the Riches of a Country con&s;i&s;ts in the Number of its Inhabitants,</HI> is an Expre&s;&s;ion that drops from the Pen of every Writer; but it mu&s;t always be under&s;tood, that tho&s;e Inhabitants are properly employed, and &s;uitably encouraged; for, otherwi&s;e, it would appear to be an odd Po&s;ition, that a Country &s;hould be called rich, when it is only filled with Vagabonds and Beggars.</P>
<P>But when it is con&s;idered, that the Northern <HI>Colonies,</HI> in le&s;s than <HI>five</HI> Years, have lo&s;t above <HI>&s;even thou&s;and</HI> of their mo&s;t active and indu&s;trious Inhabitants by an un|common Ardour in exerting them&s;elves for the public
<PB REF="006346_0007_1028A91EA3AF19F0">Good, be&s;ides a Habit of Idlene&s;s that has been contract|ed by a large Body, which has been long in Arms wait|ing for Employment; to which may be added <HI>three thou|&s;and</HI> more, who having entred on board his Maje&s;ty's Ships of War, and Privateers, are never like to return; their lo&s;s will appear almo&s;t invaluable, and not to be repaired but by replacing a much &s;uperiour Number of Men in the Country. From the apparent Connexion be|tween the Northern Colonies and the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and their joint Relation to this Kingdom, it is evident, that the Increa&s;e of Inhabitants in the former, will contribute more to the common Intere&s;t, than employing the like Number at Home. This, Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> in a Treati&s;e on Trade, has demon&s;trated to be nearly in proportion of five to one; from whence it follows, that the before-mention|ed Lo&s;s is equal to that of <HI>fifty thou&s;and</HI> Labourers and Artificers here; and in regard to tho&s;e Colonies va&s;tly exceeds the Grant lately made them by Parliament, as the Value of their Labour for <HI>three</HI> Years only would have been equal to that Sum; and notwith&s;tanding a Jealou&s;y has been frequently excited on account of their Growth, it will appear, that the Commerce and Naval Power of this Kingdom will greatly depend on their fu|ture Encouragement and Protection.</P>
<P>The Policy and Wi&s;dom of a Covernment di&s;covers it&s;elf in nothing more evidently, than by proportioning its Influences &s;o as to &s;upport, and cheri&s;h the Circulation of Trade, and Manufactures, in its minute Parts, as well as its large and more opulent Members; the &s;maller Wheels in a Machine being as nece&s;&s;ary to make it u&s;eful as the large&s;t, and commonly require the nice&s;t Skill of the Artificer in their Regulation: And without a due Regard be had in every State to the Trade of its Individuals, there is the greate&s;t Danger of the weaker Parts being oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;tronger; and whenever this happens, the Extremities are &s;ure of being the fir&s;t, and general|ly the greate&s;t Sufferers, as by their Remotene&s;s from the Vitals, they feel le&s;s of their Influences, and labour longe&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="006346_0008_1028A956625AC4F0">under their Di&s;tre&s;s; and although Di&s;orders of this Kind do not immediately affect the whole, yet the &s;malle&s;t Ob&s;tructions, if not &s;ea&s;onably removed, often produce a general Stagnation, and may prove as dangerous to the political, as to the natural Body.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, before I proceed any farther, that &s;ome Per&s;ons, either thro' Prejudice, or for Want of better Information, are too apt to in&s;inuate, that <HI>great Care ought to be taken, le&s;t tho&s;e Colonies grow too powerful, and &s;et up a Government of their own.</HI> This is &s;o far from having the lea&s;t Foundation to &s;upport it, that I am po&s;itive no People on Earth are more firmly attached to their Prince, than they are to his Maje&s;ty and the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, being all Prote&s;tants, who have ever manife&s;ted the greate&s;t Abhorrence of Popery, by which Means Roman Catholicks have been always deter|red from &s;ettling in the Country, and their con&s;tant, and repeated Demon&s;trations of Zeal and Loyalty to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, are &s;ufficient to clear them from every A&s;per&s;ion of this Kind; but to make the Matter more evident, it may be ob&s;erved, that if they were <HI>ten</HI> Times more populous, and wealthy than they are at pre&s;ent, no Motive could be urg'd of &s;ufficient Weight to induce them to a Revolt; neither the Love of Liberty, <HI>Force of Op|pre&s;&s;ion, Burthen of Taxes,</HI> or De&s;ire of becomeing more powerful, could po&s;&s;ibly Influence them to &s;truggle for Independency: If the Love of Power and Liberty &s;hould be taken into Con&s;ideration, 'tis apparent that they enjoy as great a Share of both as any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and much more than if they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> independent Govern|ment; for, in that ca&s;e, they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to put them&s;elves into the Hands of &s;ome foreign State, which could protect them from the ju&s;t Re&s;entment of this King|dom; and it is well known that is not to be done; but if it could, to whom are they to apply that would continue to them the Liberties they enjoy now? No People in their Sen&s;es would &s;ubject them&s;elves to the <HI>French, Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> with a View of &s;ecuring their Privileges with
<PB N="11" REF="006346_0009_1028A92230240150">greater Tranquility than <HI>they</HI> at pre&s;ent enjoy them; and &s;hould they aim at ab&s;olute Independency, the Expence of defending them&s;elves would infinitely exceed any they have yet been &s;ubject to, and indeed, they could not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without the Protection of their Mother Country.</P>
<P>As to any Di&s;contents that might ari&s;e from Oppre&s;|&s;ion, or the Burthen of Taxes, they are &s;ubject to none but &s;uch as re&s;ult from the Laws of their own making, an Indulgence they e&s;teem them&s;elves &s;ecured of under a Prote&s;tant King, and which gives them a Share of Power equal to their De&s;ires; and as their very Being, in a Manner, depends on this Kingdom, their Trade is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with, and grafted on it, that nothing would &s;o effectually ruin them, as to be deprived of it; for were they to be &s;upplied with <HI>European</HI> Goods by any other State, the Difference would prove fatal to them. Upon the whole, nothing can, nor ever will, pre|vail upon them to attempt, or think of a State of Indepen|dency, whil&s;t they enjoy the Freedom of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub|jects under &s;o happy a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But if, after all, it be thought dangerous to &s;uffer the Colonies to grow too large, le&s;t they &s;hould take it into their Heads to revolt, 'tis pretty extraordinary, that nei|ther the <HI>French, Dutch</HI> nor <HI>Spaniards</HI> have ever been di&s;|couraged from promoting their <HI>American</HI> Settlements; their Ca&s;e is widely different from ours; were the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Colonies, for in&s;tance, to revolt to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it would &s;carce be po&s;&s;ible for <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> to re|gain them; but as to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> not all the Force of Old <HI>Spain,</HI> if it was contiguous to that Continent, would be &s;ufficient to reduce them; and although there is &s;carce a Native of <HI>America</HI> that is &s;uf|fered to hold a Po&s;t of Profit, they wear their Chains with great Contentment; but to &s;uppo&s;e a People &s;ub|ject to none of the&s;e Grievances capable of a &s;ingle Thought of &s;etting up for them&s;elves, is branding them with a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;o fooli&s;h and unaccountable as cannot well be conceived.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006346_0010_1028A958ECC60170">
To &s;hew what may be &s;aved to the Kingdom, as well as gained by its enlarged Trade to the Northern Plan|tations, 'tis to my Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the Sugar-Co|lonies could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them: Mo&s;t of the Mate|rials for their Buildings and Works, as well as Provi&s;ions, Ca&s;k for Spirits, Sugars, Mola&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> come from thence, and that they con&s;tantly &s;end the greate&s;t Part of their Ef|fects home in <HI>New England</HI> built Ships, without which they would not be able to bear the Duties paid in this Kingdom, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Price of Freights.</P>
<P>This, if rightly con&s;idered, will appear to be an Ar|ticle of great Importance in regard to the <HI>French We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Mr. <HI>A&s;hley</HI> has very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, That, <Q>&s;hould Plantation built Ships be di&s;couraged, Freight would be &s;o dear, as to lo&s;e the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation one of the great|e&s;t Advantages over its Rivals in Trade,&mdash;<HI>a low Freight;</HI> and from the great Traffick of the Kingdom, they mu&s;t be compelled to buy Materials for building of Ships, of <HI>Foreigners,</HI> with Ca&s;h, in&s;tead of their own Manufactures, to the enriching of &s;uch <HI>Foreigners,</HI> and the Di&s;couragement of our <HI>American Colonies:</HI> That in|&s;tead of prejudicing that Branch of Bu&s;ine&s;s here, the refitting and fini&s;hing Plantation built Ships often gives as much Advantage to the Shipwrights, as the building of new Ships. The <HI>French</HI> take the Benefit of our Plantation built Ships to carry their Sugars to <HI>Spain,</HI> and commonly pay them in the Produce of their own I&s;lands, and have, in this In&s;tance, a very great Advantage of us. "That the &s;aving a Shilling or Eighteen-pence on|ly <HI>per</HI> Hundred in the Article of Freight, would go near to enable us to under-&s;ell them at foreign Markets, if the Ships employed in the Sugar Trade were indulg|ed with the &s;ame Privileges, as tho&s;e which are com|monly called <HI>Act Ships.</HI> That the flouri&s;hing State of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce, and the Revenues ari&s;ing there|from, are, in no &s;mall Degree, owing to <HI>a low Freight, occa&s;ioned chiefly from our building Ships &s;o cheap in our</HI> American <HI>Plantations.</HI> That &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> &s;truggle
<PB N="13" REF="006346_0011_1028A923B56042C8">&s;o hard to gather Strength in <HI>America,</HI> &s;urely it is the true Intere&s;t of this Kingdom to do &s;o too, and to en|courage its Northern, as well as its Southern Colonies, &s;o that they may both contribute to the Support and Benefit of their Mother Country. <HI>"The Northern Co|lonies are a great Support to the Naval Power of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and a&s;&s;i&s;t, in a great Mea&s;ure, in giving us a Superiority at Sea over all other Nations in the World:</HI> They &s;upply the King's Yards with great Quantities of Ma&s;ts, Yards and Bow&s;prits in&s;tead of tho&s;e of foreign Growth, with Pitch, Tar and Turpentine, for all which immen&s;e Quantities of Goods are exported from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which prevents five Times the Value thereof from go|ing out of the Kingdom in Ca&s;h to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and other foreign Countries.</Q></P>
<P>All the Articles with which the <HI>Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies</HI> are &s;upplied, require a great Number of Artificers and la|bouring Men to fit them for Shipping; and they are in &s;uch Demand, as to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Branch of the <HI>New England</HI> Trade, although the Price of every Article is &s;o high, as greatly to affect the Value and In|crea&s;e of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Produce; but if the Price of Labour in the Northern Colonies could be reduced <HI>fifty per Cent.</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands would receive all their Supplies &s;o much cheaper as to be able, in <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty</HI> Years, to double their Remittances, and, con&s;equently, the Duties paid on Importation.</P>
<P>By enlarging the Trade, and increa&s;ing the Number of Inhabitants in the Northern Colonies, their Demand and Abilities to pay for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Goods would be proportionable.</P>
<P>But the Price of the &s;everal Commodities with which the Sugar-Colonies are &s;upplied, and tho&s;e which are re|turned to <HI>England,</HI> is much higher than if the Country was fuller of Inhabitants, the Want of which di&s;ables the Merchant from &s;hipping its Produce, but to his own Lo&s;s, unle&s;s he carefully attends to &s;uch Articles as, by a Fluctu|ation peculiar to Trade, come to a better Market at one time than another; but were the Price of Labour re|duced,
<PB N="14" REF="006346_0012_1028A95BA5A42778">every Cargo he &s;hipped would &s;tand charged at a lower Price, and he would be enabled to pay more for his Goods in <HI>England</HI> as &s;oon as they are purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Reduction of the Price of Freight from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> by increa&s;ing the Number of Ships, is an Article of great Con&s;equence to the Sugar I&s;lands, in which they cannot well be ea&s;ed, but by Means of the Northern Co|lonies; for their Con&s;umption of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures is &s;o incon&s;iderable, compared with the Effects they &s;end Home, that the Owners of Ve&s;&s;els here mu&s;t fit them out for the common Profit of Freights from there only; but the Merchants in <HI>New-England</HI> are con&s;tantly employed in building Ships for their Corre&s;pondents in this Kingdom, which are full freighted from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and very often the Profit is equal to, and &s;ometimes ex|ceeds that of the Freight to <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that the Increa&s;e of Ships will not only oblige them to carry their Freights cheaper, but will occa&s;ion a con&s;tant and large Supply of all the North <HI>American</HI> Produce, by which they will be enabled to increa&s;e their Stock, &s;ettle new Plantations, and, in a few Years, pay double the Duty here upon the Produce of their own I&s;lands, which is an Event that principally depends on the Increa&s;e of Inhabitants in the Northern Colonies.</P>
<P>The ea&s;ier to comprehend the Certainty of this Ob&s;er|vation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ca&s;t our Eyes a while on the <HI>French</HI> Sugar-I&s;lands, who&s;e Supplies have commonly co&s;t them <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty per Cent.</HI> more than our own; not|with&s;tanding which, the Progre&s;s they have made &s;ince the la&s;t War, bids fair for &s;upplying all <HI>Europe</HI> with Su|gars, and whenever they are furni&s;hed with the Produce of <HI>North-America,</HI> as cheap as our I&s;lands, they will be able to under&s;ell us at all foreign Markets.</P>
<P>An Objection has often been made again&s;t promoting the Intere&s;t of the Northern Colonies, on account of the incon&s;iderable Proportion they pay to the public Revenue, notwith&s;tanding it is pretty evident, that neither the Sou|thern Colonies, nor the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> would be able to pay
<PB N="15" REF="006346_0013_1028A9264C2A4200">any Duties at all, were it not for the Supplies and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the former: But &s;uppo&s;ing this was not the Ca&s;e, and that the Northern Colonies yearly receive <HI>&s;ix hundred</HI> thou&s;and Pounds in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, which are paid for in &s;uch Articles as are con&s;umed in <HI>England,</HI> and pay no Duty; on the other hand, the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands year|ly receive the Value of <HI>four hundred</HI> thou&s;and Pounds in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, and remit <HI>&s;ix hundred</HI> thou&s;and Pounds Sterling in Sugars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that pay Duty here, this Kingdom gains more by the former than the latter; this follows from the Duty's being paid finally by the Con|&s;umer; for were it taken off, certainly the Price of Sugars would fall in proportion, and, con&s;equently, the whole Amount of the Duty would be &s;aved by the Con&s;umers; and was it to be laid on the Produce of the Northern Colonies in the &s;ame Proportion, all the Difference would con&s;i&s;t in &s;hifting the Payment from the Con&s;umers of the former to the Con&s;umers of the latter, and yet the Sub|ject pays it here in either Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But what mo&s;t nearly concerns the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is, the &s;urprizing Progre&s;s the <HI>French</HI> have made, and are &s;o intent in pur&s;uing, by Means of their Plantation-Trade; it is evident, that the Supplies of Provi&s;ions from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and both Provi&s;ions and Lumber from <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> have been no incon&s;iderable Means of their Growth; but to leave them both out of the Que&s;tion, the <HI>French</HI> are endeavouring, by all po&s;&s;ible Means, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the&s;e Articles from their own <HI>Northern</HI> Colonies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were, for &s;ome Time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Sea-Coa&s;t of <HI>North America,</HI> before the <HI>French</HI> had made any con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in it; they at fir&s;t &s;ettled on the North Side of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> and gradually extended their Settlements from thence to the Mouth of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi</HI> Ri|ver, cultivating the &s;tricte&s;t Harmony with the Natives, by inter-Marriages, and pro&s;elyting them to the <HI>Romi&s;h Faith,</HI> whereby they maintain a regular Corre&s;pondence through &s;everal Lakes, and large Branches of tho&s;e Rivers, for near <HI>eight hundred</HI> Leagues, on the Back of all the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible tho&s;e Parts of <HI>New France</HI> that lie in the mo&s;t Northern Latitudes, are not likely to produce many of tho&s;e Articles; but as they claim a Tract of Land of va&s;t Extent, <HI>viz.</HI> from New <HI>Orleans</HI> on the South, to the Latitude of <HI>&s;ixty Degrees</HI> North, which is above <HI>&s;ix hundred</HI> Leagues; and in Breadth from the Streights of <HI>Belli&s;le</HI> in Longitude <HI>fifty-&s;even</HI> We&s;t, to the Lake <HI>De Bois,</HI> is not le&s;s than <HI>&s;ix hundred</HI> Leagues from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, every thing is to be found in it that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>French</HI> have artfully extended their Lines within our Colonies, not only with a De&s;ign to cut off our Communication, and trade with the Natives, but to croud &s;uch of them into the Sea, as are too weak to make a Re|&s;i&s;tance, and, finally, to ma&s;ter the whole Continent.</P>
<P>This is not an Event that may &s;eem practicable in an Age, but yet the Continuance of the &s;ame Zeal and Care in promoting their Settlements for thirty Years to come, which has &s;o manife&s;tly evinced it&s;elf for thirty Years pa&s;t, would render it no difficult Undertaking; be&s;ides, the ambitious Views of <HI>France</HI> leave no room to doubt, but they will attempt what their Intere&s;t &s;o evidently calls for; it is beyond Di&s;pute that their Proceedings on this Plan will &s;oon put it in their Power; the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> only for twenty Years in Peace or War, would be no incon&s;iderable Means of effecting it.</P>

<P>The I&s;land of <HI>NEWFOUNDLAND</HI> lies between the 46th and 52d <HI>Degree</HI> of North Latitude, and is about <HI>three hundred</HI> Miles in Length, and near as broad, is &s;ur|rounded with Fi&s;hing Banks, and many fine Harbours, is very commodious for the Fi&s;hery, having every Con|veniency for promoting it, and by its Situation, being the mo&s;t ea&s;terly Part of North <HI>America,</HI> has the Advan|tage of all other Parts, on account of its Nearne&s;s to the <HI>European</HI> Markets, but it is not likely to admit of any great Improvements, the Climate being too cold, and the Soil but indifferent.</P>
<P>As there is very little Difference in the Temperature of the Air, in the &s;everal Parts of <HI>New England,</HI> &s;o its &s;everal Products, and Aptne&s;s for different Improvements, vary but in a few Particulars, the Southermo&s;t being mo&s;t natural for Corn, and the Northern for grazing, and afford a much greater Plenty of Timber and Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands are furni&s;hed from hence with Hor&s;es, and &s;everal Kinds of live Stock; Flower, Bread, Pea&s;e, &s;alted Beef, Pork, Codfi&s;h, Mackrel, Herrings, Cyder, Butter, Onlons, Oil, Turpentine.

<P>In the&s;e Colonies, the Lands which are already cleared of Timber, and improved for Tillage and Pa&s;ture, are very far from yielding &s;uch Profit to the Owner, as they
<PB N="20" REF="006346_0018_1028A963B0162670">are capable of, for Want of Manuring, and being proper|ly &s;ubdivided into &s;maller Allotments, which the great Price of Labour now makes impracticable; but as Na|ture has furni&s;hed the Country with &s;everal Sorts of Marle and Sea Ware, whenever the Farmer has been able to enrich the Soil with them, the Produce of his Lands has paid his Expence, and greatly rai&s;ed their Value, yet by Rea&s;on of the Scarcity of Labourers, very few can bear the Charge of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Cultivation; but by increa&s;ing their Number, the Country may &s;oon be enabled to do it, and con&s;equently to &s;upply the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands at a much cheaper Rate than they can now.</P>
<P>A Number of Inhabitants &s;ettled on the uncultivated Lands in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> would not be able to furni&s;h them|&s;elves with Provi&s;ions for the fir&s;t Year, but as the Coun|try is full of fine Harbours, Lakes and Rivers, the Lands are covered (as was before ob&s;erved) with Timber, and the Sea-Coa&s;t plentifully &s;tocked with Fi&s;h and wild Fowl, it will &s;oon be in their power to &s;upport them&s;elves
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> King has commonly defrayed the Charge of tran&s;port|ing his Subjects to <HI>America,</HI> and maintaining them a Year after their Arrival; and the Intere&s;t of this Kingdom never called for a more ne|ce&s;&s;ary Expence, than that of felling this Province with Prote&s;tants.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It will be of great Con&s;equence to the fir&s;t Settlers in this Country, that in clearing and &s;ubduing their Lands, they will be paid for their Labour by converting the Pro|duce into Ship-Timber, Planks, Ma&s;ts, Deal-Boards, Shin|gles, Staves and Hoops, all which may be carried from their Plantations to Market, by Ve&s;&s;els that will &s;upply them with Hor&s;es, Cattle, Swine, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, to &s;tock their improved Lands.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Advantages, 'tis ea&s;y to fore&s;ee how &s;oon it is practible to bring forward new Settlements in a Country which is &s;o well furni&s;hed with Supplies, and is &s;o near <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> a Market that will always take off their Produce, and enable them to rai&s;e their Provi&s;ions, to build their Hou&s;es, and &s;tock their Plantations, and in a few Years to export
<PB N="21" REF="006346_0019_1028A92B5BCD89D8">many valuable Commodities in Ve&s;&s;els of their own, whil&s;t they are promoting the Trade of their Country.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid it will appear, that if <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> were fully inhabited, and the Lands brought under Improvement, they would be able to furni&s;h the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> with Provi&s;ions, and other Sup|ples in larger Quantities, than they are capable of export|ing now, and their Remittances to <HI>England</HI> would not only become more con&s;iderable, but cheaper to the Merchant, by reducing the Price of Labour.</P>
<P>The Advantages that may ari&s;e to this Kingdom from &s;everal other Improvements in the Northern <HI>Colonies,</HI> when they are fully inhabited, is worthy of a particular Atten|tion; the <HI>Country</HI> is every where very apt to produce the very be&s;t of Flax, and in many Places is natural for Hemp, both which are Articles of very great Con&s;equence to this Kingdom, as the Manufucture of Linnen-Cloth within it, bears but a &s;mall Proportion to its Con&s;umption. It would &s;oon become very con&s;iderable, and le&s;&s;en the great Im|portation of Linnens from <HI>Germany, Holland, &amp;c.</HI> and the la&s;t brought home to be wought up into Cordage and Canvas.</P>
<P>The great Plenty of Iron Ore in many Parts of the <HI>Country,</HI> will enable them not only to &s;upply this King|dom with va&s;t Quantities of Pig Iron, but Iron in Bars, cheaper and equal in Goodne&s;s to the be&s;t <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Swede</HI>'s Iron, which la&s;t, according to a late Calculation, draws a|bove <HI>two hundred thou&s;and</HI> Pounds yearly from the King|dom in Money, and 'tis well known that if Labour was reduced a quarter Part in <HI>New England,</HI> they could fur|ni&s;h a Quantity equal in Value to that Sum cheaper than 'tis now imported, and receive their Returns in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Goods.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it will enable them to &s;ecure the Cod-fi&s;hery to this Kingdom, by making it more beneficial and ex|ten&s;ive than it ever has been, as the Proceeds of their Voyages will be remitted to <HI>England</HI> in Ca&s;h, and the De|mand for fre&s;h Supplies of its Commodities will be encrea&s;|ed, and its fine&s;t Nur&s;ery for Seamen enlarged.</P>

There is one Article which has excited the Jealou&s;y of this Nation more than all the Improvements the Colonies are capable of pro&s;ecuting, and that is, the rai&s;ing of Wool, and as this has never been properly repre&s;ented, I conclude it may be acceptable now; the Inhabitants of <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New York</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;ume one with another <HI>thirty</HI> Shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> yearly in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, two Thirds of which con&s;i&s;t of Woollens, and according to Mr. <HI>London</HI>'s Pamphlet, in proportion to their Numbers is equal to the Con&s;umption within this Kingdom; It will appear from his Calculations, that <HI>five hundred thou|&s;and</HI> Packs of Wool weighing <HI>two hundred and forty Pounds</HI> Weight each, are yearly wrought up in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> amounting to <HI>twenty-one Millions,</HI> of which more than one half being exported, the Number of Inhabitans, at <HI>twen|ty</HI> Shillings each Per&s;on, exceeds the Value of the Remain|der; This may be ea&s;ily demon&s;trated, by comparing the Number of People in the&s;e <HI>Colonies,</HI> amounting to <HI>four hundred thou&s;and,</HI> to the Value of their <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Importati|ons, which is above <HI>&s;ix hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> yearly, from whence it follows, that they annually con&s;ume more Woollen Cloaths than an equal Number of Inhabitants in this Kingdom; but as they are known to rai&s;e Wool in <HI>New-England,</HI> it will be a Que&s;tion, what becomes of it? to which it may be an&s;wered, that the Winter Sea&s;on be|ing commonly longer, and &s;everer than it is here, the In|habitants require more Cloaths in proportion, which may be e&s;timated at a &s;ixth Part; be&s;ides their u&s;ual Employ|ments being very different from tho&s;e of &s;edentary Arti|ficers, and indoors Manufacturers, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to enlarge their Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>It will appear from the foregoing Computation, that the&s;e Colonies produce about <HI>two thou&s;and</HI> Packs of Wool annu|ally, which is <HI>four hundred and ninety nine</HI> le&s;s in Proporti|on to the Inhabitants, than grows in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This Account may the more ea&s;ily be credited, by comparing it with the Number of Sheep &s;laughtered in the Cour&s;e of each Year, ob&s;erving, that as they are &s;mall, their Fleeces do not
<PB N="23" REF="006346_0021_1028A92DE4853E40">weigh above <HI>two Pounds</HI> one with another. But it may &s;erve more effectually to remove all Apprehen&s;ions of the <HI>Colonies</HI> being ever able to prejudice this Nation in the Woollen Manufacture, to ob&s;erve, that their Sheep are not only liable to various Di&s;tempers, but are &s;hort-liv'd, and their Wool is of a very coar&s;e Staple; for when the Win|ters from Year to Year admit of little or no Variation, they are frequently &s;ubject to a cutaneous Di&s;order, which being renewed with every Spring, cau&s;es an Itching that &s;eldom leaves them till they wear off their Fleeces by frequently rubbing them&s;elves again&s;t every thing that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to View, and when the Weather proves dry, and hotter than common, they tear their Skins as well as Coats, and are &s;oon Fly-blown, rotten, and de&s;troyed; this has often proved &s;o contagious as to end in the De&s;truction of half the Sheep in the Country; and when the Winter has been lon|ger than u&s;ual, 'tis a great Doubt whether their Lo&s;&s;es don't exceed their Increa&s;e; for it has twice happened within twenty Years, that a third Part of all their Stock has been carried off by the extreme Severity of the Weather.</P>
<P>It is uncommon to eat any Mutton in the Country of more than three Years Growth, from whence it follows, that in&s;tead of &s;laughtering one fifth of their Stock yearly, as is computed to be the Ca&s;e here, they con&s;ume a third Part, and their Fleeces falling &s;hort one half in <HI>Weight,</HI> they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e four times the Number of Sheep to produce an equal Quantity of Wool; but the Coar&s;ne&s;s of its Staple, which exceeds that of <HI>French</HI> Wool, puts it out of their Power to fabricate fine Cloaths; and its Short|ne&s;s renders it of little U&s;e but to be wrought into Stockings, and an ordinary Cloth which is more expen&s;ive, and le&s;s durable, than a much finer imported from hence.</P>
<P>It is evident from the preceding Account, that 'tis the Profit of their Mutton, rather than their Fleeces, that indu|ces them to rai&s;e any Sheep at all: Whenever their Lands have been enriched by Manuring, they find that the rai&s;ing of Beef, Pork and Corn, which are Articles of Exportation, as well as Home Con&s;umption, is of greater Advantage; for
<PB N="24" REF="006346_0022_1028A967E4585628">the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Hu&s;bandry and heavy Carriages be|ing performed by Oxen, in&s;tead of Hor&s;es, the former are doubly u&s;eful, and after a long Cour&s;e of Servitude, by two Years Idlene&s;s and fattening, produce Beef that would cre|dit the Stalls in <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> Market.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of Inhabitants in the&s;e <HI>Colonies</HI> will then ap|pear &s;o far from being injurious to the Wollen Manufactury here, that it will contribute more to promote it, &s;upplying an equal Number of People in any other Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions; but if it &s;hould ever be otherways, it will pro|ceed from Nece&s;&s;ity, rather than Choice; for if they are pro|perly encouraged in rai&s;ing of Hemp, Flax, Iron, and other rough Materials by a &s;uitable Bounty, and in tho&s;e Branches of Trade and Navigation which are not prejudicial to the general Intere&s;t of the Kingdom, their Advantages would be infinitely greater, and their Labour le&s;s, than if they pro|&s;ecuted the Wollen Manufactury: But if on the contrary, the&s;e &s;everal Articles are totally neglected, they will be ren|dered incapable of making Remittances &s;ufficient to pay for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Cloaths, and mu&s;t of Cour&s;e manufacture the be&s;t they can for them&s;elves.</P>

<P>This will not only be of immediate Service, but in a few Years will produce various good Effects, as the Coun|try abounds with Pines and Firs, it will be capable of &s;upplying this Kingdom with the fine&s;t Deal-Boards and Timber of all Kinds, in Ve&s;&s;els of its own, which are now imported from <HI>Norway,</HI> the <HI>Baltic,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>foreign</HI> Bottoms, and drains the Nation of immen&s;e Sums of Money; this is not only practicable on the fir&s;t Settlement of the <HI>Coun|try,</HI> but in the Cour&s;e of a few Years will become a &s;teady and u&s;eful Branch of Bu&s;ine&s;s: But if none of the&s;e good Con&s;equences en&s;ue, yet &s;ettling the Province with Prote&s;|tants is of the greate&s;t Importance, as the <HI>French</HI> will other|wi&s;e continue to cheri&s;h the pre&s;ent Inhabitants, till they ex|ceed the Number, and are of more Con&s;equence than tho&s;e of <HI>Canada,</HI> and it requires no long Time to effect this, in a <HI>Country</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants are not only very health|ful, but very prolific; it mu&s;t &s;urely be deemed impoli|tic then to &s;uffer &s;uch a Colony of <HI>French</HI> Bigots to be rear|ed up under the kindly Influences of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admini&s;tra|tion, to cut our own People's Throats whenever the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> &s;hall con&s;ecrate the Knife; notwith&s;tanding they hardly know the Name of a Tax or Duty, their <HI>Quit-Rent</HI> being but a Trifle, and tho&s;e who are at a great Di&s;tance from

<P>It therefore highly concerns this Kingdom, that &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable Steps be taken to prevent their future Growth, and Defection; but it is very difficult to attempt, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to effect their Removal, without Blood|&s;hed, and if they were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they would be a very great additional Strength to <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> as we could not prevent their &s;ettling in tho&s;e Places.</P>
<P>It &s;eems then more eligible to continue them in the Country, to permit them to hold &s;uch Lands as are under actual Improvement, and to which they can make out a clear Title, for 'tis beyond Di&s;pute but they claim much larger Tracts than they have any Right to.</P>
<P>Their E&s;tates are held by Patent from the <HI>French</HI> King, for which they pay a very &s;mall Acknowledgment, their Right was re&s;erved to them by the Articles of Capitulation at the Reduction of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and was finally ratified by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> but as no civil Government has ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed there, they have no more to do with their new Ma&s;ters than to pay their Quit-Rent, which in the whole Province does not amount to <HI>forty Pounds</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>When the Form of Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which is now exerci&s;ed there, the In&s;tructions to the Governor and Council were copied from tho&s;e of <HI>Virginia,</HI> whereby the Power of granting Lands is ve&s;ted in them, and is re&s;tricted to &s;uch Conditions, as have hitherto proved a great Di&s;couragement to his Maje&s;ty's Subjects; for the Patentee is not only obliged to pay a Penny <HI>Sterling per</HI> Acre for the whole, but is &s;ubject to a Penny more when|ever the Government &s;hall demand it, and unle&s;s he has built a Hou&s;e, and brought Part of his Lands under Im|provement within three Years from the Date of his Grant, he forfeits his Title: This attended with the con&s;tant

<P>From this De&s;cription of the Country, &s;everal Places will appear nece&s;&s;ary to be fortified, of which I &s;hall en|deavour to point out the mo&s;t convenient, as well as tho&s;e which are mo&s;t commodious for bringing forward the pro|po&s;ed Settlements.</P>
<P><HI>Can&s;o</HI> and <HI>Chebucto</HI> on the Sea-Coa&s;t of this Province, naturally pre&s;ent them&s;elves fir&s;t to Con&s;ideration; the for|mer from its having been a long Time improved in the Fi&s;hery, and having once had a wooden Blockhou&s;e, and a &s;mall Detachment of Troops for its Protection, and the latter for its &s;pacious and fine Harbour, and having been the Rendezvous of Duke <HI>D'Anville</HI>'s Squadron.</P>
<P><HI>Can&s;o</HI> is conveniently &s;ituated for the God Fi&s;hery, but claims the Preference to the other on no account but its having been already improved, and probably &s;ooner known; But this la&s;t greatly exceeds the former in &s;everal Re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> its Situation, its Harbour, and Aptne&s;s for Agricul|ture.</P>
<P>Its Situation is &s;uch, that it has a &s;hort and ea&s;y Com|munication by Land with all the Settlements on the Bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> is equally commodious for the Fi&s;hery with <HI>Can|&s;o,</HI> and is more in the Way of all Ships pa&s;&s;ing to and from <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>New England</HI> that may occa&s;ionally, or by Stre&s;s of Weather &s;eek a Port for Shelter, or Relief.</P>
<P>Its Harbour gives place to none in the World, and by its natural Form, and an I&s;land at its Entrance, is capable of being well defended by a regular Fortification.</P>
<P>Its Soil exceeds that of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and by the Vicinity of &s;everal fine Harbours, will afford great Conveniences to the fir&s;t Inhabitants; the&s;e &s;everal Advantages it boa&s;ts beyond any other Place on this Side of the Country; whereas
<PB N="32" REF="006346_0030_1028A97366C3FB10"><HI>Can&s;o,</HI> though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for <HI>thirty-five</HI> Years, could &s;hew no Improvements but on &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands, which pro|duced little more than a few Kitchen Gardens; its Har|bour is complained of as not well defended from hard Gales of Wind, has a very rocky and difficult Entrance, and the Communication from hence to the Inland Parts of the Province is through <HI>Chebucto,</HI> or <HI>Tatamagouche.</HI> This la&s;t Place &s;eems al&s;o to claim &s;ome Share of Attention, and may probably upon a critical Survey, be found &s;uita|ble for a Settlement, and to merit &s;uch a Fortification as may cut off all future Supplies to <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> by this Channel.</P>
<P>Leaving this Side, and the Sea Coa&s;t of the Province, I &s;hall return to the Bay of <HI>Fundy</HI> again, where the Soil, and Manner of improving Lands differs from all other Parts of North <HI>America,</HI> and where two or three different Fortre&s;&s;es will be nece&s;&s;ary to awe the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and to protect the propo&s;ed Settlements from their In&s;ults.</P>
<P>In all Parts of this Bay the Rivers are of great Length, and very numerous; the Ebbing and Flowing of the Tides is from <HI>four</HI> Fathom at the Entrance, to <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>eleven</HI> at the Head of its longe&s;t Branches; between their Banks, and the Verge of the Upland, are fine and large Tracts of Salt Mar&s;h, in many Places extending them&s;elves on a Plain for <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty</HI> Miles without Interruption: In the Bays of <HI>Minas, Chegnecto,</HI> and their &s;everal Branches, are Millions of Acres that were never yet improved; the <HI>French,</HI> in order to &s;ave them&s;elves the Labour of &s;ubdu|ing the Lands that are covered with Fore&s;t Wood, and inter&s;per&s;ed with Mora&s;&s;es, have &s;urrounded part of the&s;e Mar&s;hes with Dykes

This Land, by Rea&s;on of its natural Richne&s;s, requires very little manuring, and is not only ea&s;y of Til|lage, but affords a beautiful Pro&s;pect; their Gardens, with &s;ome Patches for particular U&s;es, being all the Upland they have under Improvement.</P>
<P>It is obvious from this Account, which is far from be|ing exaggerated, that no Country is better calculated to yield an early Support to its infant Colonies, with more Certainty and le&s;s Labour, and affording them, in the mean time, a comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Highlands which commonly lie near the Sea Coa&s;t, and the Sides of the Bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> are rocky, and covered chiefly with Firs, but produce Plenty of Gra&s;s when brought under Cultivation; the level Country is covered with &s;everal other Kinds of Wood u&s;eful in Building, and when &s;ubdued and fitted for Tillage, di&s;covers a fine rich Mold, producing all Things in Perfection that are natural to the Climate; and this will &s;erve for a general De&s;crip|tion of the Province, for altho' &s;ome Parts of the Cape <HI>Sable</HI> and <HI>Can&s;o</HI> Shores are rocky, and unfit for Tillage, they are intermixed with valuable Tracts of low Lands, navigable Rivers, and a great Number of I&s;lands, where Fi&s;h may be taken all the Year round, as the Harbours are &s;eldom ob&s;tructed with Ice.</P>
<P>On the North Side of this Bay, <HI>St. John</HI>'s River &s;eems to be the fitte&s;t Place for making a Settlement, and erect|ing a Fortre&s;s; about <HI>fifty</HI> Miles from its Entrance, the mo&s;t judicious and con&s;iderable, tho' not the mo&s;t nume|rous Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> on this Part of the Continent are &s;ettled, and in the la&s;t War had a &s;light Fortification erected by the <HI>French</HI> for their Defence.</P>
<P>Here the Land is fertile, and lies nearly on a Level very far into the Country, having a gradual Declivity on|ly towards the River, that &s;erves to direct the Cour&s;e of &s;everal large Branches into its Sides.</P>
<P>By the Information of the <HI>Natives,</HI> the inland Parts of this Country are capable of the fine&s;t Improvements, and although here is but a very little Mar&s;h-Land, the Good|ne&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="006346_0032_1028A9770C426998">of the Soil makes ample Amends for the Want of it, and here are no Claims of any Significancy to prevent the Settlement of it.</P>
<P>In order to &s;hew what Places within the Bay of <HI>Fundy</HI> are mo&s;t proper to be fortified, I &s;hall begin with this, as it is not only a very valuable Country, but is commodi|ou&s;ly &s;ituated for the Fi&s;hery; from hence the direct In|tercour&s;e with <HI>Canada</HI> is maintained through the Country, and continued acro&s;s the Bay to <HI>Minas</HI> and <HI>Annapolis,</HI> from which Places it is not more than <HI>twenty</HI> Leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Within, and very near the beforementioned Streight, the Land &s;eems conveniently elevated for erecting a For|tre&s;s that will command the Entrance, and in time of War, a Boom Chain would effectually &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;age; this Place might not only &s;erve to protect Ships in the Road below, but would be a &s;ufficient Defence to a new Settlement, and if properly garri&s;oned, might cut off the Corre&s;pondence between <HI>Quebec</HI> and the <HI>Nova Scotians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>St. John</HI>'s Tribe might on this Oc|ca&s;ion attempt to interrupt a Settlement, but as they are in a State of Ho&s;tility with us, and by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> their Lands were given up by the <HI>French</HI> to this Crown, no Peace ought to be concluded with them but upon our own Terms, for they were actually the Ag|gre&s;&s;ors, by joining the Enemy in the Siege of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> contrary to &s;everal Treaties they formerly entered into with the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Bay.</P>
<P>From this Place to <HI>Chignecto,</HI> the Country has but two or three Harbours, and the Sea Coa&s;t being very mountain|ous, and but little known, I can only a&s;&s;ert what the Na|tives &s;ay of it, that the inland Parts are fertile.</P>
<P><HI>Chignecto</HI> forming the Peninfula, which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Accadie,</HI> is commonly mentioned as a nece&s;&s;ary Place to be fortified, in order to cut off the Communication with <HI>Canada</HI> in time of War, the I&s;thmus not being here a|bove two Leagues wide: The foregoing Rea&s;on would have more weight, if the <HI>French</HI> tran&s;ported any Baggage or Train with them on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, but that is not

<P>Whenever it happens that any of their Dykes are ca|&s;ually broke down, the Overflowing of the Tide renders the Mar&s;h incapable of bearing any Corn for <HI>three</HI> Years, but afterwards, by Means of the new Recruit of Salts, which are incorporated with the Mold, the Soil is renewed, and produces as fine Crops as ever; thus Nature &s;eems by Accident to have pointed out a Proce&s;s, whereby its Fertility is re&s;tored without any Expence to the Owner: The&s;e Lands, after &s;ome Years Improvement, produce &s;everal Kinds of Gra&s;s, and &s;erve all the &s;everal U&s;es of Hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants make a joint Bu&s;ine&s;s of Dyking in &s;everal large Tracts, which &s;erve fir&s;t as common Fields, and being afterwards &s;ub-divided into &s;maller Allotments are capable of the various Improvements before-mention|ed: Their Dykes are made of large Sods of Mar&s;h cut up in &s;quare Pieces, and rai&s;ed about <HI>five</HI> Feet higher than the common Surface, of a competent Thickne&s;s to with&s;tand the Force of the Tides, and &s;oon grow very firm and durable, being over&s;pread with Gra&s;s, and have com|monly Foot-paths on their Summit, which are both con|venient and delightful.</P>
<P>On the different Branches of <HI>Minas</HI> Bay are &s;cattered &s;everal other Towns and Villages, who&s;e Inhabitants pur|&s;ue the &s;ame Methods of improving their Lands.</P>
<P>There is one Thing peculiar to the&s;e People which has &s;ecured their Allegiance during the pre&s;ent War, that is, the Dread of having their Dykes cut down, and their E&s;tates by that Means ruined by the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> this Practice they felt the &s;evere Effects of about <HI>forty</HI> Years ago, when their Lands were thus expo&s;ed by the <HI>New England</HI> For|ces, the Remembrance of which is pretty &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed on the old Inhabitants, and has had a very good Effect on their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Minas</HI> is &s;o &s;ituated, as to have a &s;hort and ea&s;y Com|munication with the extreme Parts of the Province, being
<PB N="37" REF="006346_0035_1028A9439D03A490">within a Days March of <HI>Chebucto,</HI> on the South Shore, and not much farther by Land from <HI>Annapolis,</HI> is about <HI>thirty</HI> Leagues by Water from <HI>St. John</HI>'s River, and is not much farther from <HI>Tetamagauche.</HI></P>
<P>From this Account of the Country and its Inhabitants, it appears that <HI>Minas</HI> is not only the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Part of it, but is mo&s;t properly &s;ituated for a Metropolis, and con&s;equently requires a &s;trong Fortre&s;s for its Security; &s;everal Places have been propo&s;ed in and near the Town for this Purpo&s;e, upon one of which &s;tands the <HI>Stonehou&s;e</HI> which is Proof again&s;t &s;mall Arms; this is built on an Eminence that commands great Part of the Town, but being overlooked by high Land on three Sides, would be greatly expo&s;ed in ca&s;e of an Attack: There is another Eminence that &s;tands by the River <HI>Ga&s;pero</HI> to the Ea&s;t|ward of the Town, which is &s;ubject to the like Incon|venience; but the mo&s;t proper Place, if not one of the fine&s;t in the World, on account of its natural Situation, is an I&s;land of Upland about a Quarter of a Mile long, that commands the Mouth of the River, is &s;urrounded with &s;alt Mar&s;hes, and has no firm Land within a Mile of it.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of the&s;e Mar&s;hes is &s;o &s;pongy and porous below the Level of the common Tides, as that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to open Trenches, but they will be directly filled with Water, and as they are commonly flowed at the Full and Change without the Dykes, it will appear im|practicable to make a regular Attack again&s;t it by Land, or to proceed by &s;apping or mining, and 'tis equally &s;o from Ships, unle&s;s it be attempted at high Water, and this mu&s;t be done in a very &s;hort Time on account of the Ra|pidity of the Tide, which on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion would be equally hazardous to them as the Oppo&s;ition of a &s;trong Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>This I&s;land commands the Pro&s;pect of <HI>Minas</HI> Bay, &s;o that no Ve&s;&s;el can come in or go out undi&s;covered, and if it is regularly fortified, might be defended by <HI>two hundred</HI> Men again&s;t the whole Force of <HI>Canada</HI> and the <HI>Nova Scotians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="006346_0036_1028A97B27FA1D98">
If this Plan be approved of, 'tis very ea&s;y to make an open Road from hence to <HI>Chebucto</HI> for all Sorts of Car|riages, it not being above <HI>forty</HI> Miles through the Country, and erecting a wooden Blockhou&s;e midway, that is Proof again&s;t &s;mall Arms, might &s;erve as a Place of Security to Travellers, and deter the <HI>Savages</HI> from interrupting the new Settlements.</P>
<P>It will be al&s;o requi&s;ite to fortify the Country imme|diately, that being a preparatory Step which requires &s;ome time to execute, and will be found nece&s;&s;ary to precede the propo&s;ed Settlements, who&s;e Neighbourhood will na|turally rai&s;e a Jealou&s;y among the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> that may create a great deal of Trouble, and retard the de&s;ign'd Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>To prevent the latter from being trouble&s;ome, the Go|vernor and Council &s;hould be directed to take Ho&s;tages of them to &s;ecure the Performance of &s;uch Treaties as &s;hall be entered into; for unle&s;s &s;ome &s;alutary Precautions of this Kind are u&s;ed, 'tis much better to continue the War till they are wholly extirpated; 'tis evident that for many Years the <HI>Indians</HI> did as much Mi&s;chief in <HI>New-England</HI> during a Peace as in Time of War, which has proceeded from the In&s;tigations of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;iona|ries among&s;t them, and the Want of Power in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to pur&s;ue and puni&s;h them in their wild Retreats. It is expedient that a direct Enquiry &s;hould be made into the Claims and Titles of the&s;e Inhabitants, that their Bounda|ries may be fixed; and to prevent future Contentions, all the Lands that are in the Di&s;po&s;al of the Crown &s;hould be &s;urveyed, and the Nature of their Soil, and different Qua|lities for Improvement enquired into; that a Report be made to his Maje&s;ty, of the mo&s;t commodious Places on navigable Rivers, and the Sea Coa&s;ts, for &s;ettling of Town|&s;hips, for the Conveniency of the <HI>Cod Fi&s;hery,</HI> and the Pro&s;ecution of Agriculture.</P>
<P>The Settlement of this Province will be attended with &s;ome Charge to the Government, and on that Account may probably meet with Interruption; yet as the general Ad|vantages

I cannot undertake to a&s;&s;ign a philo&s;ophical Rea&s;on for the Diffe|rence in the Temperature of the Air in two Places lying in the &s;ame Latitude, and &s;o near together as <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> and this I&s;land, but to ob&s;erve, that as the Duration, and &s;everal Degrees of cold moderate, and warm Weather in all Places vary with, and depend upon the prevailing Winds, in the &s;everal Sea&s;ons of the Year, &s;o in this, they commonly blow from &s;uch Points in the Winter as bring on Storms of Snow and Fro&s;t, and in the Summer tho&s;e are mo&s;t frequent, that blow directly from the <HI>Banks,</HI> accompanied with thick Fogs and Mi&s;ts, and altho' &s;ome Parts of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> are &s;ubject to them, 'tis neither in Degree nor Duration &s;ufficient to affect the Produce of the Earth, nor to interrupt the Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s by Land or Sea.</P>
<P>It is well known, that notwith&s;tanding the Situation of this I&s;land, four Fifths of the <HI>French</HI> Fi&s;hery have been pro&s;ecuted in other Places: Their <HI>Bankers,</HI> amounting to more than <HI>two hundred</HI> Sail of Ships in Time of Peace, who cure their Fi&s;h in Pickle, commonly called <HI>Mud-Fi&s;h,</HI> make their Voyages on the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> with|out entering a Port in <HI>America,</HI> and their large&s;t Ships to the Number of <HI>two hundred</HI> Sail, con&s;tantly u&s;e <HI>Fi&s;hot

<P>In order to rival the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Cod-Fi&s;hery,</HI> 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to confine them to the Limits &s;tipulated by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which will exclude them from all the Banks of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and it does not appear by that, or any other Treaty, that they have a Right to fi&s;h to the Southward of Cape <HI>Bonavi&s;ta</HI>

<P>If this Point had been well attended to <HI>twenty</HI> or <HI>thirty</HI> Years pa&s;t, their Fi&s;hery might have been re|duced before this Time to a contemptible Situation; but the Ca&s;e was &s;o different, that they not only fi&s;hed where they plea&s;ed, but commonly in&s;ulted our Ve&s;&s;els whenever they met them, for excepting &s;ome of their <HI>Fi&s;hermen</HI> which were &s;eized by Captain <HI>Smart</HI> on the <HI>Can&s;o</HI> Station, for fi&s;hing without their Limits contrary to Treaty, they never met with any In|terruption,
