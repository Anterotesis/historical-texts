<HEAD>A DISSERTATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>United States</HI> are a new nation, or political &s;ociety, formed at fir&s;t by the declaration of independence, out of tho&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubjects</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> who were thrown out of royal protection by act of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>December,</HI> 1775.</P>
<P>A citizen of the <HI>United States,</HI> means a member of this new nation. The principle of government being radically changed by the revolution, the political character of the people was al&s;o changed from &s;ubjects to citizens.</P>
<P>The difference is immen&s;e. Subject is derived from the latin words, <HI>&s;ub</HI> and <HI>jacio,</HI> and means one who is <HI>under</HI> the power of another; but a citizen is an <HI>unit</HI> of a ma&s;s of free people, who, collectively, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Subjects look up to a ma&s;ter, but citizens are &s;o far equal, that none have hereditary rights &s;uperior to others. Each citizen of a free &s;tate contains, within him&s;elf, by nature and the con&s;titution, as much of the common &s;overeignty as another. In the eye of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, the poli|tical condition of citizens is more exalted than that of noblemen. Dukes and earls are the creatures of kings, and may be made by them at plea&s;ure; but citizens po&s;&s;e&s;s in their own right original &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a great difference between citizens, and inhabitants or re&s;idents.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on living within a country or &s;tate, is an inha|bitant of it, or re&s;ident in it.</P>
<P>Negroes are inhabitants, but not citizens. Citizen&s;hip confers a right of voting at elections, and many other privi|leges not enjoyed by tho&s;e who are no more than inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="022088_0003_0FB788BDB9B09DA0">The preci&s;e difference may be thus &s;tated: The citizen of a free &s;tate is &s;o united to it as to po&s;&s;e&s;s an individual's proportion of the common &s;overeignty; but he who is no more than an inhabitant, or re&s;ident, has no farther connec|tion with the &s;tate in which he re&s;ides, than &s;uch as gives him &s;ecurity for his per&s;on and property, agreeably to fixed laws, without any participation in its government.</P>
<P>Republics, both ancient and modern, have been jealous of the rights of citizen&s;hip. The new con&s;titution carries this matter &s;o far, as to require not only pre&s;ent citizen&s;hip in federal repre&s;entatives and &s;enators, but antecedent citi|zen&s;hip for the term of &s;even and nine years. The time and manner of acquiring the high character of a citizen of the <HI>United States,</HI> is therefore well worthy of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The following appear to be the only modes of acquiring this di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. By being parties to the original compact, the decla|ration of independence.</P>
<P N="2">2d. By taking an oath of fidelity to &s;ome one of the <HI>United States,</HI> agreeably to law.</P>
<P N="3">3d. By tacit con&s;ent and acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P N="4">4th. By birth or inheritance.</P>
<P N="5">5th. By adoption. Of each of the&s;e in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. By the declaration of independence congre&s;s pro|claimed to the world, that their con&s;tituents, "the people of the united colonies, were ab&s;olved from all allegiance to the crown of <HI>England,</HI>" and that the late colonies were "free and independent &s;tates." For the &s;upport of this bold mea&s;ure, they confederated together, by pledging to each other "their lives, fortunes, and &s;acred honour." By this eventful declaration, "a nation was born in a day." Nearly three millions of people who had been &s;ubjects, be|came citizens. Their former political connection with <HI>George</HI> the third was done away, and a new one was formed, not with another king, but among them&s;elves, by which they became coequal citizens, and, collectively, a&s;&s;umed all the rights of &s;overeignty. As this was done by the repre|&s;entatives
<PB N="5" REF="022088_0004_0FB788C09109ADD8">
of the people of this country, and in their name, and on their behalf, all who had concurred in inve&s;ting congre&s;s with power, acquired citizen&s;hip, by being parties to this &s;olemn act. The&s;e original citizens were the found|ers of the <HI>United States.</HI> Citizen&s;hip could not be acquired in this way by ab&s;entees from <HI>America,</HI> for two rea&s;ons; 1&s;t. Such were not thrown out of <HI>Briti&s;h protection</HI> by the re|&s;training act of parliament, and therefore continued <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,</HI> under the obligations, and in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their <HI>Briti&s;h allegiance:</HI> And, &s;econdly, Such could not be parties to the con&s;titution of congre&s;s. The members of that body were not their deputies, or agents, and therefore could not bind them, or act for them.</P>
<P N="2">2d. To cement the people of <HI>America</HI> more firmly toge|ther, oaths of fidelity to the &s;tates were re&s;pectively admini|&s;tered &s;oon after the declaration of independence, to all above a certain age. By the&s;e oaths, a compact was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the &s;tate and the individuals; and tho&s;e who took them acquired or confirmed their citizen&s;hip by their own per&s;onal act. By &s;wearing to do the duty of citizens, they, by law, acquired a right to the privileges and protection of citizens. Tho&s;e who refu&s;ed, were ordered to depart, as being per&s;ons unfriendly to the revolution.</P>
<P N="3">3d. As the war drew near a clo&s;e, the admini&s;tration of oaths being le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, was le&s;s frequent. Citizen&s;hip was then, and now is, daily acquired by tacit con&s;ent or acquie|&s;cence. Minors who were not old enough to be parties to the declaration of independence, or to take the oaths of fidelity to the &s;tates at the time they were impo&s;ed, became citizens in con&s;equence of their continuing to re&s;ide in the <HI>United States</HI> after they had arrived to mature age, e&s;pecially if at the &s;ame time they claimed the protection, and per|formed the duties of citizens.</P>
<P>At twenty-one years of age, every freeman is at liberty to chu&s;e his country, his religion, and his allegiance. Tho&s;e who continue after that age in the allegiance under which they have been educated, become, by tacit con&s;ent, either &s;ubjects or citizens, as the ca&s;e may be. In this manner, young men are now daily acquiring citizen&s;hip, without the intervention of an oath.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022088_0005_0FB788C176CFFF68">It is to be ob&s;erved, that in order that &s;uch per&s;ons may acquire citizen&s;hip in this way, their re&s;idence &s;ub&s;equent to the revolution is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, previous to the commencement of their citizen&s;hip: for no man can be &s;aid &s;o far to acquie&s;ce in, or con&s;ent to a government, before he has lived under it, as to become a citizen thereof by tacit con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Citizen&s;hip, when acquired in this way by an ab&s;entee at the time of the declaration of independence, can therefore only be dated from the time in which the claimant of that high privilege became a re&s;ident under the independent go|vernment of the &s;tate of which he claims to be a citizen.</P>
<P N="4">4th. None can claim citizen&s;hip as a birth-right, but &s;uch as have been born &s;ince the declaration of independence, for this obvious rea&s;on: no man can be born a citizen of a &s;tate or government, which did not exi&s;t at the time of his birth. Citizen&s;hip is the inheritance of the children of tho&s;e who have taken a part in the late revolution: but this is confined exclu&s;ively to the children of tho&s;e who were them|&s;elves citizens. Tho&s;e who died before the revolution, could leave no political character to their children, but that of &s;ubjects, which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If they had lived, no one could be certain whether they would have adhered to the king or to congre&s;s. Their children, therefore, may claim by inheritance the rights of <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,</HI> but not of <HI>American citizens.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5th. Per&s;ons born in any country may have acquired citi|zen&s;hip by adoption, or naturalization, agreeably to law.</P>
<P>The citizen&s;hip of &s;uch mu&s;t be dated from the time of their adoption.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the following inferences re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Citizen&s;hip is an adventitious character to every adult in the <HI>United States;</HI> and there was a certain period in the lives of &s;uch per&s;ons, when they cea&s;ed to be &s;ubjects, and began to be citizens.</P>
<P>The citizen&s;hip of no man could be previous to the decla|ration of independence, and, as a natural right, belongs to none but tho&s;e who have been born of citizens &s;ince the 4th of <HI>July,</HI> 1776.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="022088_0006_0FB788C42DB8C1F8">This accounts for the u&s;e of the word <HI>re&s;ident</HI> in that para|graph of the new con&s;titution, which de&s;cribes the qualifica|tions of the pre&s;ident of the <HI>United States.</HI> The &s;enators mu&s;t be <HI>citizens</HI> nine years, and the repre&s;entatives &s;even years; but it is not &s;aid, that the pre&s;ident mu&s;t be a citizen for fourteen years. The thing was impo&s;&s;ible, for independence was then not quite twelve years declared; therefore the word <HI>re&s;ident</HI> was introduced in order to comprehend time before the declaration of independence.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame paragraph, the di&s;tinction between a citizen and a re&s;ident is con&s;titutionally recognized; for tho' it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the pre&s;ident mu&s;t have been "fourteen years a <HI>re&s;ident,</HI>" it is &s;ufficient for him to have become a <HI>citizen</HI> "at the time of the adoption of the con&s;titution." By this it is acknowledged, that one may be much longer a re&s;ident within the <HI>United States,</HI> than a citizen of the &s;ame. The preci&s;ion of this paragraph, in re&s;pect to language, is worthy of ob&s;ervation. It is not &s;aid, that the pre&s;ident mu&s;t have been a re&s;ident <HI>in,</HI> or an inhabitant <HI>of</HI> the <HI>United States,</HI> for fourteen years. The word u&s;ed is <HI>within,</HI> which, as explained by Doctor <HI>John&s;on,</HI> means, "in the compa&s;s of,"&mdash;"the inclo&s;ure of." The &s;entence, therefore, when analy&s;ed, means nothing more than that the pre&s;ident mu&s;t have been a re&s;ident within the <HI>limits</HI> of the <HI>United States</HI> for fourteen years.</P>
<P>Though the &s;tates have not exi&s;ted as &s;tates for fourteen years; yet, their geographical boundaries, or limits, have exi&s;ted from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of <HI>America.</HI> But to proceed with inferences. From the premi&s;es already e&s;tabli&s;hed, it may be farther inferred, that citizen&s;hip, by inheritance, be|longs to none but the children of tho&s;e <HI>Americans,</HI> who, having &s;urvived the declaration of independence, acquired that adventitious character in their own right, and tran&s;mit|ted it to their offspring. The children of tho&s;e who died be|fore the revolution, who are now citizens, mu&s;t have acquired that privilege in their own right, and by their own per&s;onal act; that is, by joining their country at or &s;ince the revolution.</P>
<P>Citizen&s;hip, acquired by tacit con&s;ent, is exclu&s;ively con|fined to the ca&s;es of per&s;ons who have re&s;ided within the
<PB N="8" REF="022088_0007_0FB788C820CC1670">
<HI>United States</HI> &s;ince the declaration of independence, and could not have commenced prior to their actual re&s;idence under their new and independent governments.</P>
<P>From the whole it is plain, that no private individual, tho' a native, who was ab&s;ent from this country at the time in|dependence was declared, could have acquired citizen&s;hip with the <HI>United States,</HI> prior to his returning and actually joining his countrymen &s;ub&s;equent to the revolution.</P>
<P>Dangerous con&s;equences would follow from admitting that birth and re&s;idence, before the declaration of indepen|dence in the country now called the <HI>United States,</HI> were &s;ufficient to confer the rights of citizen&s;hip on per&s;ons who were ab&s;ent during the late war, before they returned to their native country.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, many per&s;ons, ho&s;tile to our liberties and independence, might put in their claim to be citizens. All the children born in the interval between the peace of <HI>Paris,</HI> 1763, and the declaration of independence in 1776, within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> po&s;ts on our north-we&s;tern frontier, now wrongfully held from us, would be citizens. Our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> trade would be laid open to many adven|turers, who have contributed nothing towards the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our liberties: for the natives of this country, born before the revolution, who are now di&s;per&s;ed over the world, might, on that principle, fit out &s;hips, make voyages to <HI>India,</HI> come here and &s;ell their goods, under the character of citizens, from the circum&s;tance of their having been born among us thirty or forty years ago, and return with the net proceeds of their cargoes, to their pre&s;ent re&s;idence in fo|reign countries. The&s;e, and many other con&s;equences, in|jurious to the liberties and commerce of the&s;e &s;tates, would re&s;ult from admitting the dangerous po&s;ition, that birth and re&s;idence in this country, before the revolution, conferred citizen&s;hip on ab&s;entees, antecedent to their return after that event had taken place.</P>
