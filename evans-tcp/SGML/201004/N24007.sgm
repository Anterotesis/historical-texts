<P>THE following Di&s;cour&s;es, for &s;ub&s;tance, were delivered in the place where the writer &s;tatedly mini&s;ters. What was meant only for a &s;ingle congregation, is, by the de&s;ire of the hear|ers, now made public. Whether the Book which chri&s;tians take for their guide, is from heaven or of men, is an inquiry of the highe&s;t importance; and in which not a few, at the pre&s;ent time, feel deeply intere&s;ted from oppo&s;ite motives. This &s;hort &s;ummary of the principal arguments in &s;up|port of revealed religion, is indebted to the de|fences which have gone before it, and claims no advance in a &s;ubject which has employed &s;o ma|ny abler pens. It is hoped that this compendious view may be u&s;eful to &s;ome who have not had ac|ce&s;s to the large treati&s;es, which have been pub|li&s;hed on the truth and in&s;piration of the Bible.</P>

<P>MINISTERS of the go&s;pel are under high and peculiar obligations, in every age of the church, to bear public te&s;|timony in favor of the truth and divine ori|ginal of the religion which they are called to preach. The performance of this duty
<PB N="6" REF="031762_0004_0FEE3D93D09B28E0">mu&s;t lie with uncommon weight upon their minds at the pre&s;ent time; when not a few in America, and va&s;t numbers on the ea&s;tern continent, who were educated in the belief of chri&s;tianity, openly reprobate it, as the offspring of fraud or &s;uper&s;tition. It is well known that the di&s;ciples of infidelity are multiplying daily, and that they are indu&s;|triou&s;ly employed in throwing doubts and &s;cruples relative to the holy &s;criptures, be|fore the minds of tho&s;e who have not, as yet, gone over to their &s;ide. Whoever has his eyes open to di&s;cern the moral complex|ion of the day, and is friendly to the pre&s;|ent and future welfare of mankind, will feel no &s;mall concern for the ri&s;ing generation in particular. Their inexperience, and the warmth of their pa&s;&s;ions render them liable to become an ea&s;y prey to tho&s;e licentious opinions, which are highly plea&s;ing to the corrupt ta&s;te of the human heart.</P>
<P>I REQUEST of you, my young friends, as well as of per&s;ons of every age, a candid, &s;erious, and patient hearing, while I adduce &s;ome of the leading evidences in &s;upport of the truth and in&s;piration of the Bible, in a more ample manner than I have hitherto done in my public di&s;cour&s;es. In pro&s;ecu|ting this de&s;ign &s;ome things will be intro|duced,
<PB N="7" REF="031762_0005_0FEE3DA732F5A780">which may not, &s;eparately con&s;ider|ed, be thought very intere&s;ting; but I hope it will appear in the final re&s;ult, that they are nece&s;&s;ary parts of the general &s;ubject on which I am entering.</P>
<P>IF the bible be a piece of prie&s;tcraft, or the work of di&s;hone&s;t politicians, let it be given up, and &s;ink into contempt: But if it be from heaven, as we have the fulle&s;t evi|dence to believe, let it be received with all the reverence due to THE WORD OF THE LORD. Not all the art or &s;ophi&s;try of men will be able to overthrow a book that was dictated by infinite truth: And the guilt of tho&s;e who make the attempt will be awfully great; for they will be found even to fight again&s;t God!</P>
<P>THOSE per&s;ons in chri&s;tian countries who acknowledge the exi&s;tence of one God, but deny all revealed religion, have adopted the name of <HI>Dei&s;ts.</HI> They are far from being agreed among them&s;elves, except in the &s;in|gle point of denying the divine original of the &s;criptures. A con&s;iderable number of dei&s;ts in the la&s;t and pre&s;ent century, have appeared as writers again&s;t the truth and in|&s;piration of the bible. Some of them were men of acutene&s;s and learning; &s;uch as Lord Herbert, the Earl of Shaft&s;bury, Lord
<PB N="8" REF="031762_0006_0FEE3DB402712EE0">Bolingbroke, Chubb, Hume, Voltaire, Ro&s;|&s;eau, and others. Our country has not giv|en birth to any dei&s;tical writer of much note. Mr. Thomas Paine, who&s;e zeal for infidelity is well known, was born and educated in England. On his leaving the United States of America, a few years &s;ince, he repaired to France, where he &s;oon found the leaders of a large and powerful nation, as warmly en|gaged as him&s;elf for the downfal of the chri&s;tian religion, and the propagation of in|fidelity through the world. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have read Mr. Paine's "Age of Rea|&s;on," the fir&s;t and &s;econd parts, have no cau&s;e to doubt that he has &s;poken the lan|guage of his heart; for he has gone &s;o far as to utter an oath in a formal manner that he is a dei&s;t. On his darling theme he has &s;tarted little or nothing new, nor has he hand|led the &s;ubject &s;o ably as &s;everal who went be|fore him; but in impudence and ridicule he has few equals. It is much ea&s;ier to deal in confident a&s;&s;ertions, or to rai&s;e a laugh among the thoughtle&s;s, than to offer rational con|viction to the mind.</P>
<P>IT cannot be que&s;tioned that many are fond of calling them&s;elves dei&s;ts or infidels, becau&s;e they have heard that &s;ome great men have done &s;o heretofore, or are doing &s;o at
<PB N="9" REF="031762_0007_0FEE3DBB15A496A0">the pre&s;ent time; though they have never read a &s;yllable that they wrote, and are wholly ignorant of the arguments which they employ in &s;upport of their cau&s;e. Con|ver&s;ions to infidelity are ea&s;ily made among tho&s;e who are void of principle, or are galled by &s;cripture reproofs, or are determined to indulge their lu&s;ts. Hence it need not ap|pear &s;trange, that in a &s;ea&s;on of general li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, many openly renounce the pure religion that came from above.</P>
<P>A LOOSE way of thinking on moral and religious &s;ubjects has a &s;trong tendency to blind the mind, and harden the heart. In the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament frequent mention is made of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> a &s;ect who denied a future &s;tate, the re&s;urrection of the body, and the exi&s;tence of angel or &s;pirit. They were among the mo&s;t bitter enemies of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. I find no &s;atisfactory proof of the conver&s;ion of one of them to chri&s;tianity. When any have deliberately become unbelievers in the truth and divinity of the &s;criptures, they have &s;eldom been reclaimed. In mo&s;t in&s;tances they have proceeded from bad to wor&s;e, un|til according to human appearance, they have cut them&s;elves off from hope. God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand,
<PB N="10" REF="031762_0008_0FEE3DA0AE3E6CB8">is able to arre&s;t infidels of the highe&s;t cla&s;s in their cour&s;e, and &s;ubdue them by his grace; but we need &s;tronger evidence than has yet appeared, to be &s;anguine in our ex|pectations that any of them will be recover|ed from the error of their way. There is room to hope that &s;uch as are infidels through inattention may be excited to careful inqui|ry, and e&s;cape from the &s;nare in which they have begun to be entangled; and that tho&s;e who&s;e faith is wavering may be &s;ettled in the belief that the bible is true and from God. Tho&s;e who have an anxious de&s;ire to be &s;at|isfied on &s;o important a &s;ubject, will li&s;ten with avidity to every attempt to di&s;cover the grounds on which the &s;criptures may be defended, again&s;t tho&s;e who condemn them as fraught with cunningly devi&s;ed fables.</P>
<P>PIOUS chri&s;tians are fully &s;atisfied that the religion which they have embraced is of divine original; but the holy exerci&s;es of their hearts are not to be held up before infidels for their conviction. The latter will &s;ay, (and they will declare a fact not to be doubted) that they know nothing a|bout the feelings of chri&s;tian piety. Hence it may be expected that they will con&s;ider all who profe&s;s &s;uch feelings as enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and unworthy of notice. Recour&s;e mu&s;t be
<PB N="11" REF="031762_0009_0FEE3DBCAB91A7F0">had to argument; both to e&s;tabli&s;h the re|ligion in di&s;pute, and to remove objections. The faithful witne&s;&s;es, though it has been their lot to prophe&s;y a long time clothed in &s;ackcloth, will not withhold their te&s;timony in favor of the oracles of God. Being not a&s;hamed of their hope they will labor to produce &s;uch rea&s;ons for its &s;upport, as may &s;ilence, if they do not convince, gain&s;ayers. The glory of God, and the felicity of his holy intelligent kingdom, are directly pro|moted by the exhibition of truth, however it may "torment them that dwell on the earth." The friends of revelation feel them|&s;elves bound to &s;tand up in its defence: The effects of their exertions they leave with God.</P>
<P>THE words of the Apo&s;tle Paul in the text, addre&s;&s;ed to Timothy, a young mini&s;|ter, may lead us to attend to the arguments by which the &s;criptures are demon&s;trated to be true and from God. It is added in the ver&s;e next following, <HI>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works:</HI> The meaning of which is, that Timothy by attending to the evidences and de&s;ign of all &s;cripture, would be completely furni&s;hed, as a chri&s;tian and a mini&s;ter, for the di&s;charge of every duty to which he &s;hould be called.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031762_0010_0FEE3D4C9962C780">
WHEN the apo&s;tle declares that <HI>all &s;crip|ture is given by in&s;piration of God,</HI> he has par|ticular reference to the writings of the Old Te&s;tament. The&s;e were the &s;criptures which Timothy had known from a child, as is mentioned in the ver&s;e preceding the text. At the time when Paul wrote this e|pi&s;tle the whole of the new te&s;tament had not been committed to writing: But &s;uch is the connexion between its &s;everal books, and of the whole with the Jewi&s;h &s;criptures, that the two te&s;taments mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together. Whatever di&s;tinct proofs are given of the truth and in&s;piration of the new te&s;tament, and however convincing the&s;e may be to a total &s;tranger to the old te&s;tament, it is well known to every one who has read the bible with attention, that the four evangeli&s;ts, the acts of the apo&s;tles, and the epi&s;tles, abound with quotations from, and allu&s;ions to, the writings of Mo&s;es and the prophets, on the a&s;&s;umption that they were dictated by the Holy Gho&s;t. Hence, it has always been admitted both by chri&s;|tians and dei&s;ts, that the two te&s;taments are &s;o interwoven that they mu&s;t be jointly e&s;|tabli&s;hed, or given up, as the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>THE in&s;piration of all &s;cripture is not on|ly declared in the text, but its u&s;e is pointed
<PB N="13" REF="031762_0011_0FEE3DBE5F81CBC0">out: <HI>It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It is profitable <HI>for doctrine,</HI> as it directs us what to believe&mdash;<HI>for reproof,</HI> as it appri&s;es us of &s;in and warns us again&s;t it&mdash;<HI>for correction,</HI> as it recals us from wandering&mdash;and <HI>for in|&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as it inculcates all the duties of piety and virtue, with the pro|per motives to ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing from the text, at this time, it is propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="1">I. To con&s;ider the truth of the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P N="2">II. EXPLAIN in what &s;en&s;e the phra&s;e, <HI>In&s;piration of God,</HI> is to be under&s;tood when applied to <HI>all &s;cripture.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. BRING arguments to prove that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</P>
<P>UNDER each head it is de&s;igned to notice &s;everal objections, as we pa&s;s along in the di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET us con&s;ider the truth of the &s;crip|tures of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>EVERY one will ea&s;ily di&s;cern the propri|ety of con&s;idering the truth of the &s;criptures,
<PB N="14" REF="031762_0012_0FEE3D8FDF50F3D8">or the authenticity of the&s;e writings, in the fir&s;t place: &s;ince if they could be &s;hown to be a forgery, their in&s;piration mu&s;t be given up; for God will not bear witne&s;s in &s;up|port of a fal&s;hood. Be&s;ides, we mu&s;t be &s;a|tisfied that the &s;criptures are true, or contain an authentic narration of facts, before we can be warranted to produce arguments from their hi&s;tory to e&s;tabli&s;h their in&s;pir|ation.</P>
<P>IN the part of the &s;ubject before us, we are to con&s;ider the apparent candor and in|tegrity of the men who are &s;aid to have pen|ned the Bible; the circum&s;tances attending the facts they narrate; the corre&s;ponding &s;tate of the world; and the harmony of the &s;everal writers of the &s;criptures, though liv|ing in places and periods remote from each other. To the&s;e may be added, the te&s;ti|mony of profane writers, or tho&s;e who have no claim to in&s;piration.</P>
<P>WHEN we undertake to examine the truth of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> or the five fir&s;t books of the Bible, &s;aid to be written by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> we have not the advantage of appeal|ing to any cotemporary writer. That there was &s;uch a man as Mo&s;es, a leader in I&s;rael, has, I think, never been called in que&s;tion by any dei&s;t; and may therefore be taken
<PB N="15" REF="031762_0013_0FEE3D7E12C367E0">for granted. He died about fourteen hun|dred and fifty years before the birth of Chri&s;t. There is no profane writer, who&s;e works have come down to us, that lived until more than five hundred years after that period, or about the time that Jeho&s;haphat reigned in Judah. Herodotus of Greece, is the olde&s;t hi&s;torian, who&s;e writings have e&s;caped the ruins of time. He did not flouri&s;h till more than a thou&s;and years after the death of Mo&s;es. That father of profane hi&s;tory did not live until after the return of the chil|dren of I&s;rael from Babylon. There are no writings now extant &s;o ancient as the five books of Mo&s;es, unle&s;s the book of Job be an exception. This is conceded by many of the learned among the dei&s;ts.</P>
<P>HEATHEN poets and hi&s;torians have re|corded events which reach as far back as the creation. Though they have written in a fabulous &s;train; it is evident that they allude to facts which were originally taken from the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es. Tho&s;e writers &s;peak of the happy &s;tate of man when he was fir&s;t created; they repre&s;ent that he was placed in a delightful garden, and enjoyed all the ble&s;&s;ings of what they call the golden age. We al&s;o find in tho&s;e authors an account of the iron age, or the unhappy &s;tate of man
<PB N="16" REF="031762_0014_0FEE3DC8DEF1EBB8">after he had lo&s;t his primeval innocence. Strabo, the Greek geographer, who lived in an early period of the chri&s;tian era, informs that Alexander the Great, who died a little more than three hundred years before Chri&s;t, &s;ent a per&s;on to enquire into the manners and doctrine of the Bramins, or the Hindoo prie&s;ts in India. The me&s;&s;enger found one of that order named Calanus, who taught him, "That in the origin of nature plenty reigned through all the world. Milk, and wine, and honey, and oil flowed from foun|tains: but men having abu&s;ed this felicity, God deprived them of it, and condemned them to labor for the &s;u&s;tenance of their lives." Similar repre&s;entations of man's primitive innocence and happine&s;s, of his fall, and the bitter fruits of it, have been found in the writings of many of the orien|tal nations, and in tho&s;e of the Grecian phi|lo&s;ophers, who borrowed their theology from the ea&s;t. The&s;e accounts were evidently handed down by tradition from &s;ome of the fir&s;t chapters in Gene&s;is.</P>
<P>HISTORY and tradition agree with the &s;crip|tures in a&s;cribing to mankind the &s;ame pa|rents, or in deriving them from one pair. The differences in colour have created objections in &s;ome minds again&s;t the Mo&s;aic account of
<PB N="17" REF="031762_0015_0FEE3DCCD1E540C8">the propagation of the human race. This difficulty is, no doubt, the greate&s;t that phi|lo&s;ophy can urge. It is certain that climate has &s;ome influence upon the colour of the &s;kin. It is a general fact that the nations who live within the torrid zone are of a darker complexion than the inhabitants of the northern temperate zone. The whites grow darker in the cour&s;e of a few genera|tions by removing into hot climates. It is well known that the Jews, from their at|tachment to their religion, do not blend with other nations. Experience has determined that tho&s;e of them who inhabit near the e|quator for an age or two, are of a darker hue than their brethren who inhabit colder regions for an equal length of time. It will not follow from the influence of cli|mate that men will be exactly of the &s;ame complexion who have, during any given pe|riod, re&s;ided within the &s;ame parrallels of latitude; for the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere may be materially affected by high moun|tains in &s;ome places, the &s;oil, and other cau|&s;es. The Africans on the &s;lave coa&s;t, which lies within the torrid zone, are not equally black. Tho&s;e who are born and brought up near barren &s;ands, are blacker than tho&s;e who have been found in fertile places. The heat of the &s;un is much more inten&s;e on the
<PB N="18" REF="031762_0016_0FEE3DD0538233A0">former &s;oil than on the latter. The manner of living has al&s;o an effect on the complex|ion. Tribes who dwell in dirty, &s;moky cabins, or huts, are clad with the undre&s;&s;ed &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and feed on filthy food, are more &s;warthy than tho&s;e nations who dwell in convenient hou&s;es, and practi&s;e cleanli|ne&s;s in their lodging, apparel, and diet. Hence, we may probably conclude why the American Indians have a darker &s;kin than the de&s;cendants from the Engli&s;h in the &s;ame temperate climate; and why the Tartars, and others, that live at the di&s;tance of a few degrees from the north pole, are more taw|ny than the civilized nations that lie further to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>WHETHER a &s;atisfactory &s;olution of the difficulty to which we have been attending has been hit upon or not, there are &s;o many particulars in which the different nations agree, as to fa&s;ten the charge of ab&s;urdity on tho&s;e who deny them to be of one race, from the differences in the colour of their &s;kin. Be&s;ide likene&s;s of figure and organs, it has been found that men who are di&s;&s;imi|lar in complexion are alike in the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites both of body and mind; and that by long cohabitation and &s;imilar culture the differences between them are not greater
<PB N="19" REF="031762_0017_0FEE3DD46B25AB68">than among tho&s;e who are confe&s;&s;edly of one &s;tock. The &s;imilarity between the dif|ferent nations and tribes of men, is much greater than can be di&s;cerned between any two &s;pecies of animals that fall under our notice. By facts which have been long ac|cumulating, from the reports of tho&s;e who have mo&s;t exten&s;ively traver&s;ed this globe whether by &s;ea or land, the evidence that mankind are all of one race has become deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>ALL nations, that have any records re|maining, agree in tracing back the original re&s;idence of their ance&s;tors at or near that part of A&s;ia where &s;cripture hi&s;tory places them before their di&s;per&s;ion. We can find no account of the origin of nations which will bear examination but that recorded in Gen. x. which concludes with the following words, <HI>The&s;e are the families of the &s;ons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by the&s;e were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</HI></P>
<P>THE antiquity which the Chine&s;e give to their empire, and to the creation, has long been exploded by the learned, as fabulous. The authentic annals of nations, and the &s;tate of the arts and &s;ciences, be&s;t agree with the Mo&s;aic chronology.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="031762_0018_0FEE3DD847C99B48">
THE memory of the flood, which hap|pened in the days of Noah, is pre&s;erved in the writings and traditions of all the oriental nations. Marks of the deluge are plainly di&s;cernible in many places. The produc|tions of the ocean have been di&s;covered in the center of continents, at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ea; lodged in high mountains, and in mines and quarries that lie deep in the bowels of the earth. The face of the globe we inhabit appears to have been rent and torn by &s;ome violent convul&s;ion. The more the &s;urface and the interior parts of the earth have been explored, the higher is the evidence that it was once overflown by the waters of the deluge.</P>
<P>THE di&s;coveries of circumnavigators, have removed the difficulties of admitting that the earth was peopled in all parts from the plain in the land of Shinar, a little to the we&s;t of the Euphrates; on the banks of which river the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e &s;tood. The art of navigation was imperfectly under&s;tood in the days of Mo&s;es, and long after. It never ro&s;e to high perfection until the polar vir|tue of the load&s;tone was known. By di&s;|covering that the magnet would point the needle in the mariner's compa&s;s to the north and &s;outh poles, with &s;mall variations, the
<PB N="21" REF="031762_0019_0FEE3DDC41B98B28">way was prepared to venture far from the &s;ight of land, and to go on di&s;tant voyages. This di&s;covery was not made till more than thirteen hundred years after Chri&s;t. Pre|viou&s;ly to that period ve&s;&s;els might be caught by &s;torms, or the trade winds, and have been driven to remote i&s;lands, or to this continent. As the mariners had not the means of returning they mu&s;t have remain|ed in the places to which they were wafted. Shut out as they were from commerce, and being few in number, they would revert to the rude &s;tate in which they have been found. The peopling of this we&s;tern con|tinent, the mo&s;t difficult to account for of any part of the globe, might have been ef|fected not only by the cau&s;es ju&s;t named, but by emigrations acro&s;s the narrow &s;trait that divides A&s;ia and America.

<P>THE extraordinary facts narrated in the pentateuch, con&s;idered in all their circum|&s;tances, are &s;uited to confirm its truth. In this place may be mentioned the plagues in|flicted upon the Egyptians, the drying up of the water of the red &s;ea to open a pa&s;&s;age through its channel for the I&s;raelites, their forty years journey in the wilderne&s;s, the manna rained down from heaven to furni&s;h them with bread, the quails brought round their camp to afford them meat, and the wa|ter that gu&s;hed out of the rock to quench their thir&s;t. The&s;e and &s;imilar wonders were wrought to e&s;tabli&s;h the belief&mdash;That Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, was the one only living and true God, in oppo&s;ition to the polythei&s;m, or idolatry, which reign|ed among all other nations at that time. Had the &s;tory of Mo&s;es been fal&s;e, the ene|mies of the I&s;raelites would have united in detecting the impo&s;ture; and they could not have &s;ailed of &s;ucce&s;s. The known at|tachment of idolaters to their religion, would not have &s;uffered them to be idle &s;pectators of events of &s;uch importance. The facts a&s;|&s;erted
<PB N="23" REF="031762_0021_0FEE3DE3EDD4B638">were of a public nature, and there|fore mu&s;t have been overthrown had they been fal&s;e. Be&s;ides, a public appeal was made, every year, to &s;ome of the mo&s;t re|markable of them, by the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;|over, and the fea&s;t of tabernacles: The former was de&s;igned as a &s;tanding memorial of the &s;alvation of the I&s;raelites on the night in which the fir&s;t born of the Egyptians were &s;lain; the latter was in&s;tituted to pre&s;erve the memory of the I&s;raelites dwelling in tents in their journey through the wilderne&s;s. Had Mo&s;es been an impo&s;tor he would not have appointed annual fea&s;ts to keep events in remembrance, which he knew never had an exi&s;tence. His acknowledged &s;agacity mu&s;t have taught him, that on every return of tho&s;e occa&s;ions, inquiry would have been awakened, which &s;oon would have proved fatal to his &s;cheme, had it been built on fraud. His conduct had no appearance like to that of impo&s;tors; who always attempt to hide their de&s;igns from the public eye, and to avoid &s;crutiny as far as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ADMITTING human nature to have been the &s;ame in the days of Mo&s;es as now, would it be po&s;&s;ible for a man to frame &s;uch a &s;tory as he delivers and obtain general belief, if the whole were a fiction? would he pre&s;ume
<PB N="24" REF="031762_0022_0FEE3DC260177FF8">to &s;ay, that he went into a powerful kingdom and led out thence more than two millions of people&mdash;that the &s;ea was opened to make a pa&s;&s;age for them on their departure&mdash;that their enemies in the pur&s;uit of them were drowned in the &s;ame channel through which they pa&s;&s;ed on dry ground&mdash;that the redee|med nation were afterwards led forty years in a wilderne&s;s, where they were miraculou&s;|ly &s;upported from Heaven&mdash;and that in their defencele&s;s &s;tate they were protected from their enemies, who came upon them in great numbers with arms in their hands&mdash;I &s;ay, would he have uttered &s;uch a &s;tory, in ca&s;e he knew the whole to be a lie, with any ex|pectation of being believed? Mo&s;es could not have indulged any hope of exten&s;ive or la&s;ting credence, if his whole marvellous ac|count were fal&s;e, unle&s;s he had been a fool or a madman. The ability he di&s;covered has cleared him from the imputation of ei|ther of the&s;e characters from the enemies of revelation.</P>
<P>GROUNDLESS &s;tories, it is true, have pre|vailed for a time, but they have always been found to lo&s;e even their temporary credit, when neither fraud nor violence have pre|vented or &s;ilenced inquiry. Fond as man|kind are of the marvellous, they will in a
<PB N="25" REF="031762_0023_0FEE3DE80681D520">&s;hort time correct their credulity in particu|lar in&s;tances, if they are laid under no re|&s;traint in examination; e&s;pecially when facts &s;o notorious as the above are appealed to as proof. Granting, as we mu&s;t, that the over|throw of one delu&s;ion will not cure the hu|man mind of a liability to be deceived again, yet nothing is more true than that the multi|tude will not hold to any one fable long, when the public evidence which it claims for its &s;upport is di&s;covered to be fal&s;e. Let one now ri&s;e up in this country, or in any other, with the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of inculcating a new creed, and appeal to facts in proof as public as were tho&s;e recorded in the Mo&s;aic wri|tings, he would not be believed long, if the facts which he affirmed were not real; pro|vided neither &s;tratagem nor force were em|ployed to blind the eyes of the multitude, or to keep up the credit of the new religion. That the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es has been generally believed, and that for a long time, by mo&s;t who have been acquainted with it, is not de|nied by its enemies. We would a&s;k the&s;e la&s;t, on what principle this faith can be ac|counted for, if the narration on which it re&s;ts be a forgery? If Mo&s;es were either artful or tyrannical enough to keep the I&s;raelites in the dark, he could not have enchained the minds
<PB N="26" REF="031762_0024_0FEE3DE9E9E54FB0">of the &s;urrounding nations. The Egyptians in particular, who were at that time the mo&s;t acquainted with &s;cience of any nation on the globe, would have exerted them&s;elves to detect the impo&s;ture, had there been the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>No man or body of men from the earli|e&s;t ages to the pre&s;ent day, have taken it upon them to point out the time or the place when and where the Mo&s;aic religion was fabricated, if it be a forgery. Why has not this bu&s;ine&s;s been undertaken? It has not been omitted through a want of abili|ties for inve&s;tigation in &s;ome infidels. Nor have the adver&s;aries of the Bible withheld their efforts in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, through want of hatred of Mo&s;es; for no man has been more reproached and vilified by them than he. It can ea&s;ily be told when, where, and by whom, the Mahometan impo&s;ture was framed. Why, I again a&s;k, has no one undertaken to unravel the plot of Mo&s;es, if his &s;cheme be the offspring of fraud? The true an&s;wer is, that no man of thought and reflection has ever felt him&s;elf equal to the ta&s;k. The facts of which his hi&s;tory is com|po&s;ed are too glaring to be denied.</P>
<P>THE I&s;raelites cannot, with the lea&s;t co|lour of truth, be con&s;idered as con&s;piring
<PB N="27" REF="031762_0025_0FEE3DEB9BB4A6C0">with Mo&s;es to e&s;tabli&s;h a fal&s;e or a ground|le&s;s &s;tory. For though their character, af|ter they were brought under the Sinai co|venant, was not &s;o corrupt as that of other nations, it was yet far from being faultle&s;s. They are repre&s;ented as a murmuring and perver&s;e people, and very prone to idola|try. Within a &s;hort time after the law had been delivered to them from the mouth of JEHOVAH, with &s;olemn and awful maje&s;ty, they, with Aaron at their head, formed a molten calf, and wor&s;hipped it, &s;aying, "The&s;e be thy gods, O I&s;rael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." While they were in the wilderne&s;s they manife&s;ted a &s;trong inclination to return to the country where they had been in bondage, and contemplated choo&s;ing a lead|er to conduct them back into that land of idols. Yet perver&s;e as that nation was, and reluctant as they were to the wor&s;hip of the Lord, they have borne witne&s;s to the truth of the hi&s;tory given of them by Mo&s;es, and &s;ub&s;equent Old Te&s;tament writers. That people bear te&s;timony to the &s;ame facts at the pre&s;ent time. Individuals and collective bo|dies of men wi&s;h to have their names handed down to po&s;terity with honor. They &s;hud|der at the thought of a di&s;graceful memory. If we admit that the I&s;raelites would lend their aid to a forgery to render them&s;elves
<PB N="28" REF="031762_0026_0FEE3DF79E5F6400">the objects of reproach to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that a trait exi&s;ted in their characters, which di&s;tingui&s;hed them e&s;&s;en|tially from all the re&s;t of mankind that have lived from the creation to this day.</P>
<P>THE writings of Mo&s;es carry all the marks of impartiality. He not only mentions the faults of the nation, but his own faults; and proceeds to tell the particular offence which prevented him from pa&s;&s;ing over Jordan, and leading the tribes into the land of promi&s;e. Do the&s;e things carry the marks of a di&s;hon|e&s;t mind? Do they not extort from every candid per&s;on a confe&s;&s;ion of the integrity of Mo&s;es?</P>
<P>AN objection has been brought forward again&s;t the truth and authenticity of the Pentateuch, from the pa&s;&s;age recorded in Numbers xii. 3. <HI>Now the man Mo&s;es was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</HI> Upon the&s;e words Paine remarks, in his u&s;ual &s;tyle and &s;pirit,
<Q>If Mo&s;es &s;aid this of him&s;elf, he was a vain and arrogant coxcomb, and unworthy of credit; and if he did not &s;ay it, the books are without authority.</Q></P>
<P>To this objection it may be replied,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT from the account given of Mo&s;es, it appears that he was a man of re|markable
<PB N="29" REF="031762_0027_0FEE3DF931D199E0">meekne&s;s. He bore the in&s;ults of the people at large, and of his brother Aaron and &s;i&s;ter Miriam, with a compo&s;ure rarely to be met with even among per&s;ons of real piety. There are certainly occa&s;ions in which a man may appeal to the inoffen&s;ive|ne&s;s and purity of his own character. The reproachful and cruel treatment which Mo&s;es received ju&s;tifies a vindication of him|&s;elf. The credibility of other hi&s;torians of far le&s;s worth than he, has not been called in que&s;tion from the things they have &s;poken in favor of them&s;elves, when driven to make a defence again&s;t the tongue of &s;lander.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. THE text in Numb. xii. is in&s;erted by way of parenthe&s;is, and might have been added by &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent writer of the Bible. The account given of the death and burial of Mo&s;es, in the la&s;t chapter of Deu|teronomy, mu&s;t have been added by &s;ome other per&s;on. Samuel did not write any part of the &s;econd book which bears his name. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed that he wrote the whole of the fir&s;t. In the xxvth chapter of the fir&s;t book mention is made of his death. If this event be not an anticipation, but is in|troduced in the order or the time in which it happened, the evidence is deci&s;ive that he did not write any more of tho&s;e books than the
<PB N="30" REF="031762_0028_0FEE3DFAD312FAF8">twenty four chapters preceding. This does nothing towards de&s;troying or weakening the truth and authenticy of tho&s;e books, unle&s;s it were &s;omewhere affirmed in the Bible, that they both and throughout were penned by Samuel. This is no where &s;aid. While the canon of &s;cripture was unfini&s;hed, the &s;ucceeding writers might add to the parts which preceded. The manner of removing the difficulty urged from Numb. xii. 3, will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood by a compari&s;on. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that in &s;ome future di&s;tant period, in a new edition of Doctor Ram&s;ay's Hi&s;tory of the American Revolution, it &s;hould be added in a parenthe&s;is, or in a note, that Dr. Ram|&s;ay was a man of &s;cience, and of an e&s;timable character, would this de&s;troy or even weaken the credibility of his hi&s;tory? The application is ea&s;y to the ca&s;e of Mo&s;es. Some other per|&s;on in&s;erted the eulogy upon him: which in no way affects the truth of what the decea&s;ed wrote, unle&s;s it be an additional confirmation.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDE this di&s;cour&s;e with ob&s;erving that the truth of the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory is &s;uppo|&s;ed in all the other writings both of the Old Te&s;tament and the New. The evidence we hope to produce in favor of their truth and authenticity, will corroborate the arguments that have been brought in &s;upport of the truth of the five fir&s;t books of the Bible.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING in my fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, from the words ju&s;t read, attended to the evidence in &s;upport of the truth of the Mo|&s;aic writings, I now proceed to con&s;ider the truth of the other &s;criptures.</P>
<P>THAT the I&s;raelites once inhabited the land of Canaan is as well known, and as u|niver&s;ally believed by all &s;orts of men, as any part of ancient hi&s;tory. Infidels have never denied this, nor that the I&s;raelites were put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country by con|quering its former inhabitants. On that conque&s;t they have rai&s;ed one of their mo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="031762_0030_0FEE3E0273841088">formidable objections again&s;t the in&s;piration of the Bible. This objection I &s;hall con&s;ider in another place. Tho' in con&s;i&s;tency with them&s;elves, they have rejected the account of the miracles which attended the conque&s;t, they have admitted the narration in general which is contained in the book of Jo&s;hua, as true.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Jo&s;hua followed the rule of the Judges; which was &s;ucceeded by kingly government. Towards the de|cline of the kingdom of Judah the hi&s;tory of other nations becomes more authentic, and corroborates &s;cripture hi&s;tory. After the Babylonian captivity the hi&s;tory of the Jews is more and more connected with that of the A&s;&s;yrians, the Per&s;ians, the Grecians, and other nations. The return of the Jews from Babylon happened about five hundred and thirty-&s;ix years before Chri&s;t. The ac|count given of it by Ezra and Nehemiah, who&s;e books the dei&s;ts allow to be genuine, confirms the truth of the predictions of Jer|emiah and other prophets to whom were di&s;clo&s;ed the captivity and return of the Jews, before either of tho&s;e events took place. Be&s;ides, the writings of Ezra and Nehemiah refer to all the hi&s;torical books which relate to the children of I&s;rael, from
<PB N="33" REF="031762_0031_0FEE3E0A16806040">the time of Abraham to the days in which they lived. Thus we &s;ee that the Old Te&s;|tament hi&s;tory is e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all rea|&s;onable doubt.</P>
<P>IN whatever light infidels are di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider the Jewi&s;h prophets who lived be|fore the Babylonian captivity, in the time of it, or afterwards, they cannot deny that &s;uch per&s;ons exi&s;ted, without executing a ta&s;k which they have never attempted, and that is the overthrow of the whole hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament. The prophecies and the hi&s;torical books are &s;o interwoven that they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together.</P>
<P>THE difficulties which ari&s;e from the dates and numbers in the Old Te&s;tament, are not many; and the few mi&s;takes in the&s;e parti|culars are ea&s;ily accounted for. It would be &s;trange if the tran&s;cribers of the bible, a book much oftener copied than any other in the world, had in no in&s;tance erred. The Jews, as well as all the other ancient nations, made u&s;e of letters to expre&s;s numbers. The fi|gures in arithmetic, with which we are &s;o fa|miliarly acquainted, are not to be found in the writings of antiquity. They were fir&s;t introduced into Europe from Arabia, about a thou&s;and years after Chri&s;t. Several of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are very
<PB N="34" REF="031762_0032_0FEE3E0BA7388AE8">much alike in &s;hape. A tran&s;criber might ea&s;ily mi&s;take one letter for another, where the &s;imilarity between them is very great. An error of this kind might make a numer|ical calculation very wide from the truth. The Hebrew letter which &s;ignifies 4, differs very little in its &s;hape from the one which &s;ignifies 200; and the one which &s;tands for 8, from the one which &s;tands for 400. The errors in copies of the &s;criptures that are of the numerical kind, do nothing to|wards de&s;troying the truth of the&s;e wri|tings. It has never been contended that the tran&s;cribers or printers of the Bible, were un|der immediate unerring &s;upernatural influ|ence. Chronological errors, e&s;pecially in things of &s;mall con&s;equence, have never been con&s;idered as &s;ubver&s;ive of profane hi&s;tory. There is no ju&s;t cau&s;e why any thing &s;hould operate as a valid objection again&s;t the truth of the &s;criptures, which is conceded to have no weight in &s;etting a&s;ide the truth of any other writing. It may be fairly concluded from the perfections of God, that he will pre|&s;erve the e&s;&s;entials of any book that has a ju&s;t claim to in&s;piration. What need we more?</P>
<P>WITHOUT dwelling any longer upon the truth of the Old Te&s;tament, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that when it was clo&s;ed by the proph|et
<PB N="35" REF="031762_0033_0FEE3E0D54C07830">Malachi, about four hundred years before Chri&s;t, the Jewi&s;h church received as au|thentic the &s;ame books which we have now in our Bible; and admitted no other as ca|nonical.</P>
<P>As we come down to the New Te&s;tament, we fall within a more luminous period than that of Mo&s;es and the prophets.</P>
<P>WE are witne&s;&s;es of the exi&s;tence of the chri&s;tian religion. However much this may have been, or is now, de&s;pi&s;ed, no writer has undertaken to overthrow the belief that a per&s;on called JESUS CHRIST, made his ap|pearance in Pale&s;tine near 1800 years ago, and that he has had followers in the world, from the time of his entrance on his public mini&s;try down to the pre&s;ent day. The Ro|man Empire had reached its zenith, and hu|man &s;cience had ri&s;en to a higher pitch than in any former period when Je&s;us was born. There are now in many hands the writings of poets, orators, and hi&s;torians, who flour|i&s;hed a little before and a little after his birth. The&s;e authors are held in high repute by tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te for the fine arts; and the reading of them continues to form a part of a univer&s;ity education. Evidence can be col|lected from &s;ome of tho&s;e eminent perform|ances, in &s;upport of the truth of the chri&s;tian &s;criptures.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="031762_0034_0FEE3D7C77F783C0">
A QUESTSON may ari&s;e in this place, in &s;ome minds, which demands an an&s;wer, and that is, why the te&s;timony of pagans is ap|pealed to in defence of the go&s;pel? To this it may be an&s;wered, that their te&s;timony, is the te&s;timony of avowed enemies; which according to common &s;en&s;e, and the appro|ved rules of judging, has no &s;mall weight. The Heathens cannot be &s;u&s;pected of attempt|ing to build up a cau&s;e which they have ever &s;ought to de&s;troy; or of aiding in the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the facts on which it re&s;ts, unle&s;s compelled to it by the force of evidence. Let it al&s;o be remembered here, that the &s;uf|frages of pagan writers are not collected to prove that the &s;criptures are given by divine in&s;piration, but for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of con|firming their truth.</P>
<P>THAT the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t did ex|i&s;t in as early a period as his followers con|tend, may be fairly gathered from the wri|tings of Tacitus, the Roman hi&s;torian, which were publi&s;hed about &s;eventy years after Chri&s;t's death. Speaking of the fire which happened at Rome about thirty years after the crucifixion, and of the &s;u&s;picions that the Emperor Nero enkindled it, he proceeds as follows:
<Q>But neither the&s;e exertions, nor his large&s;&s;es to the people, nor his
<PB N="37" REF="031762_0035_0FEE3E169540D778">offerings to the gods, did away the infa|mous imputation under which Nero lay, of having ordered the city to be &s;et on fire. To put an end therefore to this report, he laid the guilt, and inflicted the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments upon a &s;et of peo|ple, who were held in abhorrence for their crimes, and called by the vulgar, <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> The founder of that name was Chri&s;t, who &s;uffered death in the reign of Tiberius, under his procurator Pontius Pilate. This pernicious &s;uper&s;ti|tion, thus checked for a while, broke out again; and &s;pread, not only over Judea, where the evil originated, but through Rome al&s;o, whither every thing bad upon earth finds its way, and is practi&s;ed. Some who confe&s;&s;ed their &s;ect were fir&s;t &s;eized, and afterwards by their information a va&s;t multitude were apprehended, who were convicted, not &s;o much of the crime of burning Rome, as of hatred to mankind. Their &s;ufferings at their execution were aggravated by in&s;ult and mockery, for &s;ome were di&s;gui&s;ed in the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, and worried to death by dogs&mdash; &s;ome were crucified&mdash;and others were wrapped in pitched &s;hirts, and &s;et on fire when the day clo&s;ed, that they might &s;erve
<PB N="38" REF="031762_0036_0FEE3D492E89A2A0">as lights to illuminate the night. Nero lent his own gardens for the&s;e executions; and exhibited at the &s;ame time a mock circen&s;ian entertainment, being a &s;pecta|tor of the whole in the dre&s;s of a chari|oteer, &s;ometimes mingling with the crowd on foot, and &s;ometimes viewing the &s;pec|tacles from his car. This conduct made the &s;ufferers pitied; and tho' they were criminals, and de&s;erved the &s;evere&s;t pun|i&s;hment, yet they were con&s;idered as &s;ac|rificed, not &s;o much out of a regard to the public good, as to gratify the cruelty of one man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paley's view of the Evidences of Chri&s;tianity, Bo&s;ton Edition, pages 33, 34.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THAT Tacitus was a bitter enemy to the chri&s;tian religion no one can doubt who has attended to the foregoing pa&s;&s;age. It will follow of cour&s;e that this learned pagan ad|ver&s;ary, would have rejoiced at an opportu|nity to have proved it to be a fable, had it been po&s;&s;ible. His te&s;timony in &s;upport of &s;ome of the principal facts on which it re&s;ts, could have been extorted by nothing but ir|re&s;i&s;tible evidence. We ob&s;erve that he te&s;|tifies that there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Chri&s;t, that he &s;uffered death in the reign of Tibe|rius, and under the particular government
<PB N="39" REF="031762_0037_0FEE3DA25019A888">of Pilate. He al&s;o confirms the account given in the New Te&s;tament of the tempo|rary check of the prevalence of the go&s;pel, of the &s;pread of it afterwards in Judea, the original or fir&s;t &s;pot where it was propaga|ted, and of its extending its influence to Rome; where a chri&s;tian church was gath|ered in the &s;ame age in which Chri&s;t was crucified.</P>
<P>To the te&s;timony of Tacitus might be added that of &s;everal other pagan writers. I &s;hall only add that of Pliny the younger, the Roman Governor of Bythynia and Pon|tus, places remote from the capital. His famous letter to Trajan the Emperor, was written about the &s;ame time with the pa&s;&s;age adduced from Tacitus; but relates to the affairs of his own time. He &s;peaks of the chri&s;tian religion, as a religion well known, and as having made very exten&s;ive progre&s;s in the places under his immediate govern|ment. Speaking of the chri&s;tians, he &s;ays,
<Q>There are many of every age, and of both &s;exes&mdash;nor has the contagion of this &s;u|per&s;tition &s;eized cities only, but &s;maller towns al&s;o, and the open country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Paley's view, p. 36.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>PLINY in the &s;ame letter mentions the wor&s;hip of the chri&s;tians, and gives explicit
<PB N="40" REF="031762_0038_0FEE3D67727392B8">te&s;timony to the purity of their morals. He writes,
<Q>That having examined the chri&s;|tians, &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;uper&s;tition of their way, he could find no fault; and that this was the &s;um of their error, that they were wont to meet on a fixed day, before light, and &s;ing a hymn to Chri&s;t as God, and to bind them&s;elves by a &s;olemn oath or &s;acrament, not to any wicked purpo&s;e; but not to &s;teal, nor rob, nor commit a|dultery, nor break their faith, nor detain the pledge.</Q></P>
<P>IT is natural to inquire what te&s;timony has been given to the appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the progre&s;s of his religion, by the Jewi&s;h nation, from which he de&s;cended as a man. According to the Evangeli&s;ts Chri&s;t's per&s;onal mini&s;try was almo&s;t wholly confined to that people, and by their influ|ence he was condemned to die. It is cer|tain that the Jews ever &s;ince the coming of Je&s;us of Nazareth into the world, have ad|mitted that he was born in the days of Herod the great&mdash;that he entered upon his public mini&s;try in Judea&mdash;that he did many won|derful things&mdash;that he gained a number of di&s;ciples&mdash;that by the in&s;tigation of their rulers he was put to death&mdash;that according to the report of his followers he was re&s;tored
<PB N="41" REF="031762_0039_0FEE3E1831FF1668">to life on the third day after his crucifixion&mdash;and that his religion had an early and exten&s;ive &s;pread. The body of the Jewi&s;h nation did not receive him as the Me&s;&s;iah; for they expected, and &s;till expect, a tempo|ral prince under that character. They be|lieved, in the days in which Je&s;us appeared, that if he were the promi&s;ed Shiloh, he would have brought them out from under the Ro|man yoke, and have rai&s;ed their nation to the &s;ummit of earthly glory. The Saviour whom chri&s;tians acknowledge, declared, both by words and actions, that his king|dom is not of this world; and condemned in a pointed manner, the reigning corrup|tions in the faith and practice of the Jews. They rejected this illu&s;trious me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of ho&s;ts, they charged him with ca&s;ting out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils, and pur&s;ued him with implacable malice and rancour until they had brought him to the cro&s;s. We are not therefore to expect honorable mention of Je&s;us Chri&s;t or of his religion by them. Some indeed of the modern Jews acknowledge that the chri&s;|tian Me&s;&s;iah inculcated many good moral precepts, and ju&s;tly reproach many of his profe&s;&s;ed followers with a total want of his &s;pirit; but they con&s;ider him &s;till as an im|po&s;tor.
<PB N="42" REF="031762_0040_0FEE3E19CE843790">On the whole, we can collect as much evidence from the Jewi&s;h nation in fa|vor of the early exi&s;tence of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, as could under all circum&s;tances be expected; allowing it to be true.</P>
<P>WHEN we recur to the whole &s;eries of chri&s;tian writers, from the beginning of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution down to the pre&s;ent time, we find that they all proceed upon the gen|eral account, which is contained in our &s;criptures, and upon no other. The ordi|nances of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, and the Sabbath, have been kept up in the chri&s;tian church from the time of the Apo&s;|tles to the day in which we live. The few exceptions found among &s;mall and tempo|rary &s;ects of chri&s;tians, do not affect the general argument, or the u&s;age of the church at large. The foregoing rites con&s;idered in this connexion, afford no &s;mall proof of the facts which they recognize; &s;uch as the death and the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as &s;et forth in the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;ta|ment. We ju&s;tly con&s;ider the declaration of the Independence of the United States of America, as a great and memorable event. Should the day on which it was declared, be marked with peculiar public tokens of re&s;pect from generation to generation, will
<PB N="43" REF="031762_0041_0FEE3E1B67C73A40">not evidence be fairly collected hundreds of years hence, by tho&s;e who &s;hall then live, that the political birth of our republic hap|pened on the 4th of July 1776? The appli|cation to the &s;ubject which this &s;uppo&s;ition is de&s;igned to illu&s;trate, is too plain to be mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IN further confirmation of the truth and authenticity of the books of the New Te&s;ta|ment, we find the four go&s;pels written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, are quoted, or plainly alluded to, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tian wri|ters, beginning with tho&s;e who lived in the &s;ame age with the Apo&s;tles, and continuing through all the &s;ub&s;equent periods to the pre&s;ent time. By the works of tho&s;e wri|ters it appears that the &s;tory of the birth, life, mini&s;try, death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and the effects that &s;oon followed, was the &s;ame from the fir&s;t as now. Quo|tations from the early ages of the chri&s;tian church, have been made from the Epi&s;tles as well as from the hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament. Whoever receives the hi&s;torical books as authentic and genuine, cannot ju&s;tly doubt concerning the Epi&s;tles; for the latter proceed on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of the former: as mu&s;t appear to
<PB N="44" REF="031762_0042_0FEE3E21EAC70CC0">every one who attentively reads the New Te&s;tament. Its hi&s;torical books are quoted, or plainly alluded to, by Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, as we find by their writings that have come down to us. Tho&s;e fathers, as is generally admitted, were cotemporary with the Apo&s;|tles, and were the hearers and companions of &s;ome one or more of the twelve. In the &s;econd century from the birth of Chri&s;t, we collect te&s;timony of the kind now under con&s;ideration from the writings of Ju&s;tin Martyr, Irenoeus, Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. In the third century, quotations from, and references to, the New Te&s;tament, are numerous in the chri&s;tian writers of that period: among whom are to be enumerated Origen, Dio|ny&s;ius, and Cyprian. As we advance far into the fourth century, we find the books written by chri&s;tians to be as full of &s;cripture pa&s;&s;ages, as the printed &s;ermons of modern divines; it is therefore unnece&s;&s;ary to name any more chri&s;tian writers under this head. If we be &s;atisfied by the te&s;timonies in &s;up|port of the truth and authenticity of the New Te&s;tament, that can be adduced from the fir&s;t three centuries, we &s;hall find nothing to perplex our belief in the ages that have fol|lowed.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="031762_0043_0FEE3D7222E7D250">
THE force of the te&s;timony which has been brought, is greatly &s;trengthened by the agreement of the &s;everal writers with each other, in their references to the books of the New Te&s;tament. They al&s;o refer to tho&s;e books as clothed with <HI>divine</HI> authority, and con&s;ider the &s;criptures as the <HI>only</HI> wri|tings which are given by in&s;piration of God. If it &s;hould be &s;aid that the writers of the &s;econd century were kept from contradicting them&s;elves, or others, in quoting from the New Te&s;tament, by attending to the quota|tions made by the writers of the fir&s;t centu|ry, and that the writers of the third century ob&s;erved the &s;ame precaution it may be ob|&s;erved. 1&s;t. That &s;uch an agreement in a forgery, if the go&s;pel be fal&s;e, among &s;uch numbers, in places &s;o remote from each other, and for three hundred years, is with|out a parallel in the annals of mankind; and &s;ince no miraculous evidence is appealed to for the proof of &s;uch an unprecedented fact, the objection has no weight. 2d. The chri&s;|tian writers of the fir&s;t century lived in coun|tries remote from each other. Clement flouri&s;hed at Rome, Ignatius at Antioch, and Polycarp at Smyrna.</P>
<P>THE identity or &s;amene&s;s of the chri&s;tian &s;tory, in every age &s;ince it was fir&s;t promul|gated,
<PB N="46" REF="031762_0044_0FEE3E2777C22F68">may be fairly concluded from the early collection of the books of the New Te&s;tament into a di&s;tinct volume, and the u&s;e that was made of them. They were publicly read and expounded in the religious a&s;&s;emblies of the chri&s;tians who lived in the early ages. Commentaries were written up|on them; and they were tran&s;lated into dif|ferent languages. Attempts were al&s;o made in the infancy of the chri&s;tian church, to re|concile with each other the different accounts of the four evangeli&s;ts, as recorded in the copy which we have in our hands.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e that was made of the New Te&s;ta|ment, in the controver&s;ies that aro&s;e early in the chri&s;tian church, tends to the confirmation of the &s;ubject we are now con&s;idering. The &s;everal parties appealed to the &s;ame writings for proof of their re&s;pective opinions. Mo&s;t even of the heretics acknowledged the whole of the New Te&s;tament; and the few who did not, received the greater part of it as true, and of divine original. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that the different opinioni&s;ts who had a re&s;pect for the &s;ame &s;criptures, to which they had equal acce&s;s, would &s;erve as a check upon each other, again&s;t attempting any al|teration of tho&s;e writings, had they been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. We argue with certainty in this
<PB N="47" REF="031762_0045_0FEE3E2B3A7D1948">ca&s;e, becau&s;e we build upon the known feel|ings of human nature. To render the mat|ter plain, let us come down to controver&s;ies among chri&s;tians with which we are ac|quainted. Should the Pre&s;byterians attempt an alteration of tho&s;e texts which the Epi&s;|copalians employ in &s;upport of their cau&s;e, the latter would not fail to detect and ex|po&s;e the fraud. The &s;ame remark may be made with re&s;pect to the vigilance of the Pre&s;byterians, in ca&s;e the Epi&s;copalians were guilty of the like fraudulent conduct. Were the Pedobapti&s;ts, or tho&s;e who hold to in|fant Bapti&s;m, to add to, or dimini&s;h from, the words in the Bible, on which the con|trover&s;y between them and the Bapti&s;ts turn, the latter would hold up the de&s;igned de|ception to the world. Were the Bapti&s;ts to alter the di&s;puted pa&s;&s;ages, the Pedobapti&s;ts would expo&s;e the forgery, or era&s;ement. What ever evils have flown from the divi&s;|ions in the chri&s;tian church, we di&s;cern that good has come out of them in this one re|&s;pect at lea&s;t&mdash;The pre&s;ervation of the &s;acred volume from being corrupted.</P>
<P>IN this connexion we may &s;ee, that a &s;at|isfactory an&s;wer can be given to the follow|ing inquiry, which we &s;ometimes hear,
<Q>How &s;hall illiterate people know that the
<PB N="48" REF="031762_0046_0FEE3E2D97F8EEB0">pre&s;ent copies of the Bible, in the original tongues in which they were written, or in the tran&s;lation which they have are ju&s;t? As they have no knowledge of tho&s;e an|cient languages, how do they know but that they are deceived about the text?</Q> To this it may be replied&mdash;that per&s;ons who are unacquainted with the languages in which the &s;criptures were fir&s;t written, have no ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear that any material errors have crept into the Hebrew or Greek copies, or into their tran&s;lations; becau&s;e learned men of various denominations, and who are, &s;ome of them, very wide apart in &s;entiment, appeal to the &s;ame &s;criptures in their original tongues; and con&s;tantly &s;erve as &s;pies upon each other again&s;t any alteration of moment, either in the tran&s;cribing or tran&s;lating of them. The pre&s;ent tran&s;lation of the Bible into our language, is acknowledged by learn|ed men of different denominations, to be done with great judgment and impartiality. The few who have wi&s;hed to rai&s;e an outcry again&s;t it, have not been highly re&s;pected by chri&s;tians in general, for their attachment to revealed religion. The pre&s;ent tran&s;lation was fini&s;hed almo&s;t two hundred years ago.</P>
<P>IT is indeed true that a knowledge of the languages in which the &s;criptures were fir&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="031762_0047_0FEE3D6907C36188">written, will be helpful in under&s;tanding them; becau&s;e the tran&s;lators were not wholly clear from mi&s;takes; and more e&s;|pecially becau&s;e there are idioms in every language, or peculiar forms of &s;peech, that cannot be completely expre&s;&s;ed in any other. But the Bible is &s;o tran&s;lated, that no one will be led into any material error by the pre&s;ent ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>RETURNING from digre&s;&s;ion, I proceed to ob&s;erve that the &s;ame hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament, which we have in our hands, were early attacked by the adver&s;a|ries of our religion; as by Cel&s;us, in the &s;econd century, Porphyry, in the third, and Julian the apo&s;tate, in the fourth. The&s;e learned pagans do not hint at any other hi&s;tories as received among chri&s;tians, con|cerning the life, mini&s;try, death, and re&s;ur|rection, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the propagation of his religion, but tho&s;e contained in the four Evangeli&s;ts, and in the Acts of the A|po&s;tles. Their violent enmity to the chri&s;|tian religion, would have led them to de&s;troy or weaken the authenticity of the books which its friends received, had it been in their power. As they never attempted this, but built their objections on the &s;ame books
<PB N="50" REF="031762_0048_0FEE3E3135B63A98">which are contained in our copies, the evi|dence is conclu&s;ive that the hi&s;torical records to which chri&s;tians appealed then, were the &s;ame which we now have.</P>
<P>To the foregoing arguments may be ad|ded&mdash;that many formal catalogues of au|thentic &s;criptures were publi&s;hed within four hundred years from the birth of Chri&s;t, by his followers, which contain all the books both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, that are received by chri&s;tians, as canonical at the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>IT is well known to all who have gone far into the inquiry concerning the truth and authenticity of the New Te&s;tament, that many &s;purious or apocryphal writings ap|peared in &s;ome of the early ages of chri&s;tian|ity, under the names of the Evangeli&s;ts, A|po&s;tles, and other per&s;ons. Such fictions may be accounted for, from the fondne&s;s of the human mind to enlarge on a marvellous &s;tory that had begun to engage general at|tention in many places, and from lucrative motives. We have certain proof that tho&s;e forgeries were never received by the chri&s;|tian church as canonical. They did not ap|pear in the fir&s;t century from the birth of Chri&s;t; in which all the hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament were univer&s;ally known
<PB N="51" REF="031762_0049_0FEE3E3BF1E41070">and received by chri&s;tians. Primitive chri&s;|tians never appear to have had any doubt concerning the truth and genuinene&s;s of the four Evangeli&s;ts, and the Acts of the Apo&s;|tles, which contain the principal facts on which the go&s;pel re&s;ts. Of the apocryphal writings few have been pre&s;erved entire to the pre&s;ent time. From the&s;e, as well as from the fragments of the re&s;t to be collect|ed from other writers, tho&s;e &s;purious pro|ductions, the mo&s;t of them, are di&s;covered to be full of trifling, &s;illy &s;tories and contra|dictions, and to be compo&s;ed in a very dif|ferent &s;tyle from the books which chri&s;tians receive. It is however apparent from all tho&s;e forgeries, that they allude to the &s;ame general hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles which is contained in the New Te&s;tament. None of the apocryphal writings were ever admitted into the &s;ame volume with the ca|nonical books, nor into the catalogues of authentic &s;cripture that have been publi&s;hed. They were not noticed by the adver&s;aries of the chri&s;tian religion in its infancy, nor were they appealed to, as an authority, by any of the ancient chri&s;tian writers, in their con|trover&s;ies with each other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader who wi&s;hes to go into a full examination of the truth and authenticity of the New Te&s;tament, is re|ferred to the authorities which have principally guided the writer of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, on that &s;ubject, viz. Jones's new and full method of &s;ettling the canonical authority of the New Te&s;tament, and Paley's view of the Evidences of Chri&s;tianity. The author regrets that he has not had ac|ce&s;s to Lardner's Credibility of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="031762_0050_0FEE3E3D8669DC68">
THE differences in the accounts given by the Evangeli&s;ts concerning the life, mini&s;try death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t create no objection to the truth of their hi&s;tory. Some circum&s;tances are mentioned by one Evangeli&s;t which are omitted by another; but on examination it is found that they are all con&s;i&s;tent with the general &s;tory, and with each other. Differences in hi&s;tory are not nece&s;&s;arily con&s;idered as contradictions. Two or more writers on the American Rev|olution, may mention different facts, and yet their narrations may be harmonious. The genealogies of Chri&s;t given by Matthew and Luke are different; but they are reconciled with truth, by con&s;idering that Matthew gives the genealogy of Chri&s;t in the line of Jo&s;eph his reputed father, and Luke traces it in the line of Mary his real mother. The differences in the accounts given by the E|vangeli&s;ts of the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, are reconcileable with each other.</P>
<P>THE evidence of the truth of the hi&s;tori|ans of the New Te&s;tament is greater, than if they all had mentioned the &s;ame facts and
<PB N="53" REF="031762_0051_0FEE3E3F5A4A4920">no other. In that ca&s;e it might have been objected with more appearance of plau&s;ibil|ity, that they wrote in concert with a de&s;ign to make out one &s;tory, to impo&s;e on man|kind. When a number of witne&s;&s;es te&s;tify to a complicated fact, before a court of ju&s;|tice, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame words and with the &s;ame circum&s;tances, a &s;u&s;picion more ea&s;ily ari&s;es in the minds of the Judges, of collu&s;ion and fraud in the per&s;ons who give te&s;timony, than when they employ different words, and bring up different circum&s;tances that are reconcileable with the general fact, and with each other, and ca&s;t light upon the whole affair.</P>
<P>IF any will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to di&s;credit the Evangeli&s;ts becau&s;e they narrate events that happened long ago, they mu&s;t, to be con|&s;i&s;tent reject all ancient hi&s;tory. They mu&s;t di&s;believe that there ever were &s;uch men as Cyrus, Alexander the great, or Julius Ce&s;ar; for if their exi&s;tence be admitted, credit mu&s;t be given to &s;ome of the records of ancient times. We all admit many things to be true of which we have not been eye-witne&s;&s;|es, on human te&s;timony. If the witne&s;&s;es be credible, we do not withhold our a&s;&s;ent to what they te&s;tify, becau&s;e the facts they af|firm happened at a time, or in a place, re|mote
<PB N="54" REF="031762_0052_0FEE3E40F859CBE8">from us. If we will allow nothing to be true that has not been immediately ad|dre&s;&s;ed to our &s;en&s;es, our knowledge will be confined within very narrow bounds in|deed.&mdash;We of this audience, on that &s;uppo|&s;ition, ought not to believe that there are &s;uch places as London, Paris, or Am&s;ter|dam; for we have not beheld them with our own eyes.</P>
<P>INFIDELS, in &s;ome of their objections a|gain&s;t the Bible, have fallen into modes of rea&s;oning relative to facts, which they would be a&s;hamed to adopt when applied to any other &s;ubject. Hence, we have grounds to &s;u&s;pect that they are governed by a wi&s;h to prove the &s;criptures to be fal&s;e, rather than by the candor which they profe&s;s to take for their guide. They urge the &s;upernat|ural events narrated in &s;acred hi&s;tory as a &s;ufficient bar again&s;t admitting its truth. Mr. Hume, a dei&s;t of great &s;ubtilty, has la|bored to prove that experience is the only guide, to be relied on, in rea&s;oning concern|ing matters of fact. If he mean by experi|ence, what falls under each man's particular ob&s;ervation, he mu&s;t go all the ab&s;urd lengths of di&s;crediting the exi&s;tence of every thing which is not known either by the immedi|ate te&s;timony of the external &s;en&s;es, or the
<PB N="55" REF="031762_0053_0FEE3E4472754068">immediate perceptions of the mind. If Mr. Hume acted upon his own &s;cheme in the &s;en&s;e in which it is now taken, he certainly did not believe in any part of ancient hi&s;to|ry, except in things daily occurring; &s;uch as the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, the eb|bing and flowing of the tide, the change of the &s;ea&s;ons, &amp;c. Nor did he expect that the readers of his hi&s;tory of England, would give credit to a large part of it, unle&s;s gov|erned by the credulity which he explodes. If by experience be meant the u&s;ual cour&s;e of events, it will follow that no report which relates to an uncommon event ought to be believed. On this hypothe&s;is, we have no &s;ufficient grounds to believe that King Charles I. of England, was beheaded in the year 1649, or that Louis XVI. of France lo&s;t his life on the &s;caffold in 1793. It has not been u&s;ual for kings to lo&s;e their lives by the hand of the executioner, after the for|malities of a law trial; and as we were not pre&s;ent when either of tho&s;e monarchs is &s;aid to have had his head &s;truck off, we are ju&s;tified in rejecting the report as a fable. Such ab&s;urd con&s;equences as the&s;e will fol|low from the principles laid down by the mo&s;t &s;ubtle dei&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troy|ing the credibility of miracles. If the ex|i&s;tence of the&s;e is inadmi&s;&s;ible, the Bible
<PB N="56" REF="031762_0054_0FEE3E4DAD594C78">mu&s;t be renounced as given by divine in&s;pi|ration.</P>
<P>THE portion of under&s;tanding which is &s;o equally di&s;tributed among mankind, is fully competent to decide on the evidence deri|ved from facts which take place before their eyes. None of the intricacies of ab&s;tract rea&s;oning are needed in &s;uch ca&s;es. This remark agrees with the known &s;en&s;e of all judicial bodies on the earth. To the &s;ame common &s;en&s;e I appeal, whether the Apo&s;|tles and other witne&s;&s;es of the facts recorded in the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament, were not competent judges of the truth of what they a&s;&s;ert? If they were, their te&s;timony is to be received as valid; unle&s;s it can be &s;et a&s;ide from &s;omething that appears in their characters, or in the circum&s;tances which at|tend their narration. No ju&s;t objection can ari&s;e from either of the&s;e quarters, when we candidly attend to the ca&s;e. The truth of the &s;criptures is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by admit|ting, as all men do when not bewildered by &s;ophi&s;try or prejudice, that credible human te&s;timony is the &s;ole criterion of the truth of facts otherwi&s;e unknown. By this plain and approved &s;tandard, we are willing that the truth of the &s;criptures &s;hould be tried&mdash;We need not fear the re&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="031762_0055_0FEE3E4F4BB33188">
THE candor and impartiality of the writers of the New Te&s;tament, are too manife&s;t to be denied. They narrate their own faults, without endeavoring to palliate them. This exonerates them from the charge of attempt|ing to impo&s;e a forgery on the world. To this they had no inducement. The religion they publi&s;hed condemns fal&s;ehood in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and dooms liars and deceiv|ers, in particular, to eternal mi&s;ery. But had they been &s;o hardened, as to have been in no fear from the judgment to come, they had no temporal inducement to &s;upport their zeal for the propagation of the go&s;pel: for by becoming the open advocates of it, they had to renounce the plea&s;ures, the riches, and the honors, of the world, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to meet death in its mo&s;t dreadful forms. But after all, had they been di&s;po|&s;ed to deceive mankind with a fal&s;e &s;tory, it would have been wholly impracticable under the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances. They publi&s;hed their hi&s;tory on the &s;cene of action&mdash;they appealed to public facts&mdash;and they made the appeal while the facts were recent. Their enemies, who had both knowledge and pow|er, would have unveiled the plot, had their &s;cheme been built on a lie. The rulers of the Jewi&s;h nation were, as a body, wholly oppo&s;ed to chri&s;tianity, and would have
<PB N="58" REF="031762_0056_0FEE3D4ADDC34340">cru&s;hed it in the birth had their malice been able to have accompli&s;hed its wi&s;hes. Had the religion of Je&s;us been a fraud, it would &s;oon, like other frauds that are dete&s;ted by tho&s;e in power, have peri&s;hed from the earth. We are not to confine the &s;cene to Judea, where chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t di&s;played, it was carried into the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, into Greece and Rome and other places, within a few years after the death of its founder. The malice, the learning, and the prejudices of Heathens as well as Jews were exerted again&s;t it. Its propagation was not in dark and ob&s;cure places, but in the mo&s;t noted places then in the world. It was too in the day when the famous Roman Empire had brought not only Judea, but all countries of much re|nown, to bow to her arms, and to pour their riches into her trea&s;ury. At the &s;ame time that &s;he extended her &s;ceptre over the world, &s;he reigned mi&s;tre&s;s of the arts.
<Q>At the time when Chri&s;t appeared, the Roman Empire had reached the very meridian of its glory. It was the illu&s;trious peri|od, when power and policy receiving aid from learning and &s;cience, and embeli&s;h|ment from the orators and the poets, gave law to the world, directed its ta&s;te, and even controled its opinions. It was the age when inquiry was awake and active

It was, in &s;hort, &s;uch an age as impo&s;ture mu&s;t have found in every re&s;pect the lea&s;t au&s;picious to its de&s;igns; e&s;pecially &s;uch an impo&s;ture as chri&s;tian|ity, if it had de&s;erved the name.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White's Sermons, containing a view of Chri&s;tianity and Mahometani&s;m, in their Hi&s;tory, their Evidence, and their Effects, p. 133, 134.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t planting of the go&s;pel in the world, and its prevalence for &s;o long a time, under all the attending circum&s;tances, if it were a forgery, would be a greater miracle, than any it claims for its &s;upport; and would be without a parallel in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>

<P>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor|rection, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the two former di&s;cour&s;es from the text, we have attended to the truth of the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment. I now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To explain in what &s;en&s;e the phra&s;e <HI>In&s;piration of God,</HI> is to be under&s;tood when applied to <HI>all &s;cripture.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="031762_0059_0FEE3E5A842FBB48">
BY <HI>in&s;piration</HI> is to be under&s;tood, either an immediate communication of facts or doctrines from God, to the minds of the men who were employed in delivering the Bible to mankind, or in directing them what to write, or in &s;ecuring them from er|ror. They had facts and doctrines commu|nicated to them immediately from God, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as much as if it were now communicated to us what, is tran&s;acting, this moment, at the di&s;tance of thou&s;ands of miles from us. Whenever they wrote any part of &s;cripture they were directed from on High what to record, and at the &s;ame time they were &s;ecured from error in what they wrote to guide the faith and the practice of mankind. That part of &s;cripture which does not fall under in&s;piration in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e that has been given, falls under it in the two la&s;t &s;en&s;es; and hence it may be &s;aid with &s;trict propriety, <HI>that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God,</HI> and forms an in|fallible rule of faith and practice.</P>
<P>THE meaning of in&s;piration fir&s;t given, will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood by a few examples. To Noah was immediately revealed that a deluge would come upon the earth&mdash;To A|braham, that his &s;eed &s;hould be afflicted by a people in who&s;e land they &s;hould be a
<PB N="63" REF="031762_0060_0FEE3E5C1B5CD260">&s;tranger, four hundred years&mdash;To Mo&s;es, the deliverance of the I&s;raelites from their Egyptian bondage by his hand&mdash;To Samuel, the overthrow of Saul, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of David on the throne of I&s;rael&mdash;To Jeremiah, the &s;eventy years captivity of the kingdom of Judah&mdash;To Paul, the Anti|chri&s;tian apo&s;tacy&mdash;And to John, the dura|tion of the reign of the man of &s;in, and the principal events relative to the church to the end of the world. In&s;piration, in this high &s;en&s;e, is not only employed in revealing facts but doctrines; &s;uch as the mode of the di|vine exi&s;tence, the character and offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the immortality of the &s;oul, the future judgment, and the re&s;urrection of the dead. Under this head may al&s;o be ranked po&s;itive precepts, or in&s;titutions; whether binding on the Jewi&s;h or the chri&s;|tian church.</P>
<P>THOSE who acknowledge the exi&s;tence of God, will not deny the po&s;&s;ibility of his communicating truth to the human mind in this extraordinary manner; whether by vi&s;ions, by an audible voice, or in any other way. No per&s;on demands credit from oth|ers, as having &s;uch immediate intercour&s;e with the Deity, unle&s;s he evidence his illu|mination by means as extraordinary as the
<PB N="64" REF="031762_0061_0FEE3D1D4D9D1B80">way in which he received his knowledge. Hence, we may &s;ee the importance of mira|cles to confirm the divine original of the Bi|ble; as will hereafter be con&s;idered. We may be under as real obligation to receive as divine what is revealed immediately to others, as tho' it were revealed in the &s;ame way to us. The evidence that God hath commi&s;&s;ioned others to &s;peak in his name may be &s;o conclu&s;ive, as to leave us without excu&s;e in unbelief. Whether the Mo&s;t High &s;peak to us without, or through, the in&s;tru|mentality of creatures, his voice is the &s;ame, and his authority is equally binding. His right to be obeyed is not founded on the manner of communicating his will, but in his nature, and in our relation to him. Whenever we have certain proof &s;et before us, that the righteous Lord of heaven and earth commands our faith or obedience, we are forbidden to withhold our homage a &s;in|gle moment.</P>
<P>IN defining in&s;piration it was ob&s;erved, in the &s;econd place, that the men who penned the &s;criptures were directed by God what to write. I need make no exception here for &s;uch in&s;tances as that of Baruch, and others, employed by the in&s;pired men as &s;cribes; becau&s;e the&s;e la&s;t were the mere
<PB N="65" REF="031762_0062_0FEE3E5DAC7AB030">organs of the men who took them into their &s;ervice, and pronounced the words which they wrote. If the Prophets, Evangeli&s;ts, or Apo&s;tles, were, in any in&s;tance left to their own di&s;cretion what to record in the &s;criptures, the&s;e writings could not, with any propriety, be con&s;idered throughout as giv|en by in&s;piration of God; as Paul declares in the text. Be&s;ides, if the in&s;pired men were, in any in&s;tance, left to their own di&s;|cretion what to in&s;ert in the Bible, we might mutilate it to &s;uch a degree, as to render it a very unmeaning book. This has actually been done by &s;ome nominal chri&s;tians. They have profe&s;&s;ed to believe in the facts and doctrines immediately revealed from heav|en; but have con&s;idered the &s;ub&s;equent building upon them in the &s;criptures, as the opinions of fallible men. By treating the &s;acred volume in this manner, they have brought it down to &s;peak a language which gives very little offence to open infidels. The approach of the former cla&s;s of per&s;ons to the latter is &s;o near, as to render the dif|ference &s;carcely di&s;cernible; and paves the way for their complete union.</P>
<P>IN perfect con&s;i&s;tency with what has been &s;aid, it is admitted, that the Prophets, the
<PB N="66" REF="031762_0063_0FEE3D37B13267F8">Evangeli&s;ts, and the Apo&s;tles, might have a knowledge of many things in&s;erted in the canon, by their own ob&s;ervation, and the accounts given them by other men. The revelations made to the patriarchs, and the facts handed down from one generation to another, probably were the &s;ources through which Mo&s;es was furni&s;hed with matter for the book of Gene&s;is. At the &s;ame time he was directed by omni&s;cience what to record. This &s;uperintending influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, gave the &s;ame authority to what he wrote, as tho' it had been immediately com|municated to his mind.</P>
<P>THE third &s;en&s;e in which in&s;piration is taken, and that is, &s;ecuring the &s;acred pen|men from error in what they wrote, is as nece&s;&s;ary, as the former ones, to give to the &s;criptures the divine authority which they claim, in every thing that relates to our re|ligious faith and practice. Whatever doc|trines or laws may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been given by the Mo&s;t High, we can have no &s;atisfactory evidence of their divine original, if the men who are &s;aid to have recorded them, were not &s;ecured from error in com|mitting them to writing.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved here, that the infalli|bility of the &s;criptures is confined to the <HI>re|ligious</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="031762_0064_0FEE3DB0D54E0A60">in&s;truction which they contain. As they were revealed as much for the benefit of the unlearned as the learned, they are not employed in teaching human &s;cience, or in correcting errors relative to it. Matters of this kind are but incidentally mentioned, and always for moral purpo&s;es. It is whol|ly foreign to their de&s;ign to decide on the di&s;putes in natural philo&s;ophy or a&s;tronomy. They leave the&s;e, and &s;imilar things, as they find them. They, for in&s;tance, &s;peak of the ri&s;ing and the &s;etting of the &s;un, in a &s;tile which is familiar to all mankind, and in the &s;ame manner which is u&s;ed, even by tho&s;e who have gone farthe&s;t in the &s;tudy of the kingdom of nature, at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>IT is not contended that the per&s;ons who were in&s;pired to write the Bible, were free from &s;in or error, con&s;idered as <HI>men;</HI> for their faults and mi&s;takes &s;tand on the &s;acred pages. Even a meek Mo&s;es offended, du|ring the abode of the I&s;raelites at Kade&s;h, when he &s;aid to them, "mu&s;t <HI>we</HI> fetch you water out of this rock?" David, who wrote mo&s;t of the P&s;alms, committed an atrocious crime in the matter of Uriah. Peter deni|ed his Lord and Ma&s;ter, and at the &s;ame time horribly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the third com|mandment. The other in&s;pired men &s;aid
<PB N="68" REF="031762_0065_0FEE3D3AE65C7710">and did enough to convince all who have read their hi&s;tory, that they were men of like pa&s;&s;ions with others. But, as they were under <HI>the immediate or &s;uperintending in|fluence of in&s;piration,</HI> they uttered nothing but what is true; either as matter of fact, or doctrine, or warning, or promi&s;e, or threatning, or is, in &s;ome way, related to the de&s;ign of the author of the &s;criptures, in giving them to the human race. The &s;a|cred penmen declared facts when they told their own &s;ins. The evangeli&s;ts are to be credited, when they inform of the di&s;putes among the Apo&s;tles, who &s;hould be the greate&s;t in the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, and of their ignorance of its nature. It is as really the de&s;ign of the Holy Spirit to have the &s;ins, the follies, and the ignorance, of pious men, expo&s;ed, whether in&s;pired or not, as to have doctrines and precepts recorded. It will appear, by a little reflexion, that tho&s;e blemi&s;hes may be improved to enforce the reproof and the correction named in the text. When we &s;ee a Mo&s;es, a David, and a Peter, offend, is not the warning of the Apo&s;tle highly enforced, <HI>Let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall?</HI></P>
<P>THE words and actions of Satan and wicked men are recorded in the &s;criptures;
<PB N="69" REF="031762_0066_0FEE3E6764EE8378">to lay open their characters, to ju&s;tify God in puni&s;hing, and to warn again&s;t traveling in the path of his enemies. It is declared of the devil, "That he was a murderer from the beginning; and that he is a liar, and the father of it." We find this character exemplified in the hi&s;tory which is given of him. He came with the malicious de&s;ign of a murderer, to our mother Eve, and with a lie in his mouth, when he &s;aid, <HI>ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> This fir&s;t lie that was ever told in our world, has often been repeated &s;ince; and the tempter &s;till continues to attempt the ruin of the human race by fraud and ma|lice. Is there a fal&s;e, &s;ubtle, a malicious, and a potent, enemy to mankind, con&s;tantly going about like a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour? And is it not wor|thy of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, to ap|pri&s;e and warn the human race of his de&s;|tructive de&s;ign? How can this be done, without giving to us &s;ome knowledge of the di&s;po&s;ition of the adver&s;ary, and the evils he has introduced? It was certainly a high proof of the benevolence and mercy of Chri&s;t, when he &s;aid to Peter, "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031762_0067_0FEE3D479CD09E10">
WE have &s;et before us the character of the wicked generation that lived in Noah's time, in Abraham's, and in &s;ub&s;equent ages previous to the coming of Chri&s;t, and &s;ince; to illu&s;trate the depravity of the human heart, to proclaim the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in taking vengeance, and to di&s;play the riches of his grace towards the &s;aved. We are moreover warned by &s;uch repre&s;enta|tions again&s;t tru&s;ting in man, and are coun|&s;elled to put our tru&s;t in the living God. Particular examples of wickedne&s;s in per&s;ons of different ranks and &s;tations, and &s;ome of them under the be&s;t external advantages, or under the mo&s;t &s;olemn admonitions, are a|dapted to convince us of the ob&s;tinacy of &s;inners, and that the change which is wrought in the renewed is effected by the &s;overeign mercy of God. A hardened Pha|raoh, a bla&s;pheming Rab&s;hakeh, a proud Nebuchadnezzar, a cruel Herod, and a treacherous Judas, &s;tand as &s;o many beacons, to reprove and warn mankind. It is as wor|thy of infinite truth and purity to delineate &s;uch characters, as tho&s;e of a meek Mo&s;es, a pious Hezekiah, a faithful Daniel, a believ|ing Simeon, and an amiable John. When we behold our&s;elves compa&s;&s;ed about with &s;o great a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, as &s;acred hi&s;tory points out to us, we have every inducement
<PB N="71" REF="031762_0068_0FEE3E69092CB588">to lay a&s;ide every weight, and the &s;in which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et us, and to run with pa|tience the chri&s;tian race.</P>
<P>IF any will go about to vilify the &s;crip|tures, becau&s;e they contain an account of the corruptions of the human race, they betray great ignorance and wickedne&s;s. Such repre&s;entations as the Bible contains on this &s;ubject, are &s;o far from fixing a &s;tain on the character of Jehovah, that, in the connexion in which they &s;tand, they paint his hatred of &s;in in the mo&s;t glaring co|lours. No per&s;on of an hone&s;t heart, and who is tolerably acquainted with the &s;acred writings, can long remain at a lo&s;s what things are held up in them to be imitated, and what to be avoided. The &s;criptures collectively may be &s;tiled <HI>The Word of the LORD,</HI> as they inform us, what the Lord di|rects us to believe, what to practi&s;e, and what to &s;hun. Their general de&s;ign is the &s;ame; whether they are delivered in the form of doctrine, precept, or hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>A LARGE proportion of the Bible is hi&s;|torical. This form of writing is well &s;uited to engage the mind of the reader, as it com|municates in&s;truction in a plea&s;ing manner. Of the truth of this every one may be con|vinced, by reflecting on the effects which he
<PB N="72" REF="031762_0069_0FEE3D65D2163408">perceives from li&s;tening to an intere&s;ting &s;to|ry. Who can avoid being moved in read|ing the life of Jo&s;eph; the pre&s;ervation of Mo&s;es when expo&s;ed on the banks of the river of Egypt, in his infancy; the life of Elijah, and others. The accounts which are given of particular per&s;ons in &s;cripture, are not de&s;igned to amu&s;e, like a romance; but to afford moral and religious in&s;truction. The hi&s;tory of the birth, life, death, re&s;ur|rection, and a&s;cen&s;ion, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, com|pri&s;es events of greater magnitude, and high|er importance, than any other that have been publi&s;hed in this world.</P>
<P>SCRIPTURE hi&s;tory confirms the truth of the prophecies, by conducting us to the ful|filment of many of them. It unfolds the happy tendency of piety and virtue, and the mi&s;ery that is derived from &s;in. By the hi&s;|tory of the Jewi&s;h nation, in particular, are exhibited the effects of obedience, and of di&s;obedience, as they re&s;pect communities. Peculiar as was the form of government under which that people were placed, im|portant in&s;tructions are given by the divine conduct towards them, to all mankind. The ri&s;e and fall of heathen empires, narra|ted in the &s;acred writings, proclaim the doc|trine of divine providence; and announce,
<PB N="73" REF="031762_0070_0FEE3D4FC4B23988">that however nations may be lifted up with their conque&s;ts and pro&s;perity, they will, &s;ooner or later, have their reckoning day. The Lord will cau&s;e the arrogancy of the proud to cea&s;e, and will lay low the haugh|tine&s;s of the terrible.</P>
<P>THE long li&s;ts of names which are found in &s;everal of the &s;cripture books, are not without u&s;e. Among the &s;everal purpo&s;es an&s;wered by the in&s;ertion of tho&s;e cata|logues, the two following are obvious, and important: the one is, to confirm the de|&s;cent of all nations from Shem, Ham, and Japheth; the other is, to evince that Chri&s;t, as concerning the fle&s;h, de&s;cended from A|braham, in the line of I&s;aac and Jacob, the tribe of Judah, and the hou&s;e of David, a|greeably to prediction and promi&s;e.</P>
<P>MANY of the common affairs and occur|rences of life are recorded in the Bible. Were all the&s;e excluded, we &s;hould not have evidence, at lea&s;t in its pre&s;ent degree, that the &s;acred volume was de&s;igned for the u&s;e of mankind. It de&s;cribes them not only with re&s;pect to their moral &s;tate, and future de&s;tination, but in their various concerns with the pre&s;ent world. Our race, for in|&s;tance, are repre&s;ented in the &s;criptures, as
<PB N="74" REF="031762_0071_0FEE3D361F40E678">having need of food for &s;u&s;tenance, and rai|ment for clothing, &s;o long as they remain on the earth. The nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e is not di|mini&s;hed by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;pirit of piety, or of in&s;piration. God enjoins in his word a temperate and charitable u&s;e of worldly goods, but he doth not require that ab&s;trac|tion from them of the living, which can be found only among tho&s;e who are lodged in the grave. All temporal enjoyments, inclu|ding natural life, are to be given up, and literally to be parted with, rather than deny Chri&s;t. At the &s;ame time it is to be ob&s;er|ved, that the &s;acrifices which are made of earthly ble&s;&s;ings to indulge a capricious &s;anc|timony, are not the fruits of evangelical love, but the offspring of pride. Religioni&s;ts have appeared under the chri&s;tian name, who have repre&s;ented the perfection of piety as very much con&s;i&s;ting in "neglecting of the body," and in "ab&s;taining from meats which God hath created to be received with thank&s;giving of them who believe and know the truth." The Apo&s;tle Paul in writing for the cloak that he left at Troas, for the books, and the parchments, &s;hows, that as a man he had the &s;ame wants, and might be benefitted by the &s;ame outward convenien|ces, as other men. The in&s;ertion of this pa&s;&s;age in the &s;criptures, as well as of other
<PB N="75" REF="031762_0072_0FEE3D7FA4BCA1F0">incidents of a like kind, does not appear tri|fling, after what has been &s;aid on the pro|priety of introducing in the Bible the com|mon affairs of life. It is as really the mind of the author of that &s;acred book, that &s;uch things &s;hould be incidentally in&s;erted, as tho&s;e that were immediately revealed from on high.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome things which the &s;crip|tures declare to be lawful, that may not be expedient under certain circum&s;tances. To a ca&s;e of that kind the Apo&s;tle Paul refers in 1 Cor. vii. 6. <HI>But I &s;peak this by permi&s;|&s;ion, and not of commandment.</HI> Under the head of expediency is al&s;o to be placed the advice of the Apo&s;tle in the 25th ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter, <HI>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</HI> The Apo&s;tle is here con&s;idering whether it were eligible for chri&s;tians to marry while &s;uffering per&s;ecu|tion, as they were when he wrote this epi&s;tle. He gives it as his opinion that it would be better for them to remain in a &s;tate of celib|acy. He leaves it, however, with individu|als to determine for them&s;elves. As God hath, by a perpetual law, authorized mar|riage between the &s;exes, without the forbid|den
<PB N="76" REF="031762_0073_0FEE3D644149BA28">degrees of con&s;anguinity, and where nothing with re&s;pect to character forbids, the Apo&s;tle could not be commi&s;&s;ioned to deliver a prohibitory precept in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. To the Corinthians, who had written to him to inquire whether it were proper that marriages &s;hould go on as u&s;ual among their members, it was of no le&s;s im|portance to be informed what was left to in|dividual choice, than to know what was po&s;i|tively binding on all in other things. The whole church of Chri&s;t is as really in&s;truct|ed by the text under con&s;ideration as by any other. Be&s;ides, it is foretold in 1 Tim. iv. that, among the apo&s;tates in the latter times, there &s;hould ri&s;e up tho&s;e who would <HI>forbid to marry.</HI> This prediction has been verified by the decrees of the church of Rome, and of &s;ome other nominal chri&s;tians. The e|vent has therefore &s;hown the importance of a &s;cripture pa&s;&s;age, in which an Apo&s;tle de|clares that God never prohibited marriage in times of per&s;ecution; but that even in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons he has left it to the judgment of individual chri&s;tians, whether to enter into the matrimonial bond or not. If the fore|going remarks be ju&s;t, it will follow, that the text in que&s;tion was in&s;erted in the Bi|ble by the &s;uperintending influence of the &s;pirit of in&s;piration.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031762_0074_0FEE3E6AA0B0E968">
WHEN the Apo&s;tle &s;ays in the beginning of the 12th ver&s;e, <HI>But to the re&s;t &s;peak I, not the Lord,</HI> his meaning apparently is, that he was going to deliver &s;omething to guide the practice of the church, which had not been before particularly revealed: It is for this rea&s;on he declares, "&s;peak <HI>I,</HI> not the Lord." That he is &s;o to be under&s;tood, appears from the words which immediately follow in the 12th and 13th ver&s;es compared with the 10th and 11th ver&s;es. The pa&s;&s;ages which &s;tand next in order to the clau&s;e already ci|ted, are, <HI>If any brother hath a wife that believ|eth not, and &s;he be plea&s;ed to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an hu&s;band that believeth not, and if he be plea&s;ed to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</HI> On the conver&s;ion of a hu&s;band, or a wife, from heatheni&s;m to chri&s;tianity, a que&s;tion naturally aro&s;e, whether the be|liever was to renounce matrimonial connex|ion with his or her unbelieving correlate, as the Jews who had married idolatrous wives, were commanded to do, in the days of Ezra. The Apo&s;tle forbids divorces on that ground; and the prohibition that he deliv|ers, appears to be clothed with the &s;ame di|vine authority as the one named in the 10th and 11th ver&s;es, which contain the follow|ing
<PB N="78" REF="031762_0075_0FEE3D3952B955C0">words, <HI>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord. Let not the wife de|part from her hu&s;band: But, and if &s;he depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her hu&s;band: and let not the hu&s;band put away his wife.</HI> In this la&s;t quotation, the words "not I, but the <HI>Lord,</HI>" refer to what Chri&s;t had before &s;poken on the &s;ubject of divorce, recorded in Matthew v. 32, and xix. 9. Mark x. 11, 12. Luke xvi. 18. With the thoughts kept in mind which have been &s;ug|ge&s;ted in an&s;wer to the difficulties, which have ari&s;en from &s;ome parts of the &s;eventh chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthian church, it will, I apprehend, be ea&s;y to main|tain that the whole chapter claims a place in the in&s;pired volume, as much as any other. If the original penmen of the Bible were, in any in&s;tance, left to their own di&s;cretion what to in&s;ert, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to defend again&s;t infidels, that <HI>all &s;cripture</HI> is given by in&s;piration of God, as is affirmed in the text. The Prophets, the Evangeli&s;ts, and the A|po&s;tles, when their matter was immediately revealed from on high, or when it was re|ceived in other ways, were guided by the Holy Gho&s;t what to write, and were &s;ecured from error in writing.

THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> argument may be taken from the nature of the religion contained in the Bible. In this book the Deity is repre&s;ented as a &s;pirit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an eternal, underived, and independent exi&s;tence; as being every where pre&s;ent at one and the &s;ame time; as being infinite in knowledge, and in power, and in every other attribute that is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute ab&s;olute greatne&s;s. JEHOVAH, the God whom chri&s;tians adore, is not only infinitely great, but infinitely good&mdash;He is love. He is the rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity; ju&s;t and right is he. He is the LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the ho&s;t of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the &s;ea together as an heap; he layeth up the depth in &s;torehou&s;es. Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world &s;tand in awe of him: for he &s;pake, and it was done, he commanded, and it &s;tood fa&s;t. He made the world, and all things therein. He hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before ap|pointed, and the bounds of their habitation.

<P>THE moral law, delivered from Mount Si|nai, con&s;i&s;ts of ten precepts; the four fir&s;t of which point out our duty to God, and the &s;ix la&s;t our duty to mankind. The &s;um of the whole is, to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our &s;oul, and with all our &s;trength, and with all our mind; and our neighbor as our&s;elves. The &s;pirit of this law was binding on man from the creation, and every one of its precepts will remain obligatory upon him for ever. What can be more rea&s;onable than that an intelligent creature be required to place his &s;upreme affections upon that infinite Being, who gave birth to him and all things around him? And pre&s;erves and governs his work|man&s;hip, and is the &s;um of perfection and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? The other branch of the mor|al law, which re&s;pects our neighbor, is built upon truth and equity. The portion of rational moral exi&s;tence in our fellow-creatures is of as much worth as ours, and de&s;erves the &s;ame regard. Be&s;ides, it mu&s;t follow from our &s;ocial nature, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of its indulgence for our happine&s;s, that if we are &s;trangers to holy love, we
<PB N="82" REF="031762_0079_0FEE3DA57858CE00">cannot enjoy &s;ociety in perfection, or have any of its plea&s;ures long continued to us.</P>
<P>A CODE of laws was given to the Jews, be&s;ide the ten commandments, re&s;pecting their peculiar government and wor&s;hip, which was de&s;igned to la&s;t only until the time of reformation, or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the New Te&s;tament wor&s;hip; when al&s;o the lamp of divine truth was to be carried, as we have &s;een to the Gentile nations. The peculiar in&s;titutions given to the I&s;rael|ites under the Mo&s;aic economy, were partly adapted to their uncultivated &s;tate: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, was that of the cities of refuge, to provide for the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e who might unde&s;ignedly take away the life of any per&s;on. This in&s;titution, however, with many others, was de&s;igned to teach the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement for &s;inful man, and of his flying to it as the only way of e&s;caping from the cur&s;e of God's holy law. Jehovah taught the children of I&s;rael, for a long time concerning the advent of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the nature of his kingdom, by types and &s;hadows. Particular precepts which may appear to us, under our circum|&s;tances, and at our di&s;tance of time from their exi&s;tence, of &s;mall moment, were of great importance to that people; as calcu|lated
<PB N="83" REF="031762_0080_0FEE3E75047933E0">to keep them di&s;tinct from other na|tions, and to wean them from idolatrous rites, to which they were &s;trongly inclined. We may add, that in all probability, had the Jewi&s;h ritual been as &s;imple as the Chri&s;tian, the I&s;raelites could not have been kept to the ob&s;ervance of it in any tolerable degree, with their general character, with|out a con&s;tant &s;eries of miraculous interpo|&s;itions: But &s;uch con&s;tant departures from the laws of nature, would, in time, have cea&s;ed to excite wonder, and the end for which miracles are wrought, would have been defeated.</P>
<P>WE may determine from the conduct of infinite wi&s;dom, that it was not proper that divine revelation &s;hould communicate all the light to mankind in the days of Mo&s;es, which it has communicated &s;ince. The communication of truth was gradual, as ap|pears from comparing the two Te&s;taments together. Light was con&s;tantly increa&s;ing in the Jewi&s;h church, by the ri&s;e of new prophets, or the fulfilment of former proph|ecies, until the Sinai covenant was aboli&s;hed. Comparatively dark as the ancient di&s;pen&s;a|tion was, which continued for more than fifteen hundred years, every devout wor&s;hip|per knew, that to obey was better than &s;ac|rifice;
<PB N="84" REF="031762_0081_0FEE3DA3E4E177A0">and that the &s;um of duty con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>doing ju&s;tly, and in loving mercy, and in walk|ing humbly with God.</HI> The Jews were abun|dantly taught that the Me&s;&s;iah would be|come incarnate, and dwell among men; and that by his advent light would break forth in greater brightne&s;s than in any for|mer period. Hence, the woman of Sama|ria, who believed in the Old Te&s;tament, &s;aid, in her conference with Chri&s;t, in John iv. "I know that Me&s;&s;ias cometh, which is called Chri&s;t: when he is come, he will tell us all things."</P>
<P>THE manner in which God is to be wor|&s;hipped, as revealed in &s;cripture, is pure and rational: and contains an admirable di&s;play of infinite maje&s;ty and conde&s;cen&s;ion. The homage required is adapted to fill the &s;oul with holy reverence, and to in&s;pire it with hope; "For thus &s;aith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, who&s;e name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and humble &s;pirit, to revive the &s;pirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lvii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>How apo&s;tate man may come before the Lord and find acceptance, is a que&s;tion on
<PB N="85" REF="031762_0082_0FEE3E7AFAC21D40">which the light of nature is wholly &s;ilent. It is only in the in&s;pired volume that the doc|trine of the <HI>atonement,</HI> which hath been made by the Son of God, is revealed. The mediato|rial plan was promulgated early after the a|po&s;tacy of our fir&s;t parents, even before they were bani&s;hed from the garden of Eden for their di&s;obedience. In the fulne&s;s of time the promi&s;ed Saviour appeared in the world, made his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, ro&s;e from the dead, and a&s;cended to &s;it at the Father's right hand. Through him penitent &s;inners draw near to God, are delivered from the wrath to come, and are made heirs of eter|nal life. Whatever difficulties attend the expiatory &s;cheme exhibited in the go&s;pel, we may clearly di&s;cern in it, the infinite purity and rectitude of God's character and law&mdash;his hatred of &s;in; and the riches of his grace. The&s;e prominent features of the &s;cripture doctrine of atonement, declare it to be worthy of the wi&s;dom of the divine mind; and recommend it in the highe&s;t manner to our fallen race. It is only in con&s;equence of the interpo&s;ition of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that any of mankind have obtained the heavenly happine&s;s; whether before or &s;ince the actual incarnation of the Son of God: "Neither is there &s;alvation in any
<PB N="86" REF="031762_0083_0FEE3E7E75474C28">other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved."</P>
<P>REVELATION brings to light the future exi&s;tence of man, the re&s;urrection of the body, the future judgment, and the portion of the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t in the world to come. The&s;e are &s;olemn truths; &s;uited to deter the wicked, and to encourage the good patiently to continue in well-doing. Noth|ing &s;tamps value on time&mdash;on man's pre&s;ent life, like the eternal &s;tate which is to follow; in which each one is to receive from the righteous judge of the living and the dead, according to the deeds done in the body. The puni&s;hment threatened to the impeni|tent is calculated to di&s;play the divine holi|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice; is fitted to their character, and to excite dread. The reward promi&s;ed to the righteous, corre&s;ponds only with the temper of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are united with the God of love.</P>
<P>THE piety and virtue inculcated in the oracles of truth, breathe a &s;pirit to which the proud and &s;elfi&s;h hearts of mankind are wholly oppo&s;ed. Love to God and man is the root of the graces and virtues, which compo&s;e the character that meets the appro|bation of the infinite mind.</P>

THE man who&s;e piety is evangelical, makes an unfeigned dedication of him&s;elf to God; and the feelings of his heart, &s;o far as he is &s;anctified, fully harmonize with the di|vine law and government. He approaches his heavenly Father with filial reverence, and can, without re&s;erve, adopt the form of prayer that Chri&s;t taught his di&s;ciples;
<Q>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into tempta|tion, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen.</Q> This prayer, as one ob&s;erves,
<Q>for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;olemn thoughts, for fixing the attention upon a few great points, for &s;uitablene&s;s to every condition, for &s;ufficiency, for conci&s;ene&s;s without ob&s;curity, for the weight and real importance of its petitions, is without an equal or a rival.</Q> The pious man is humble: He feels his ab&s;olute dependence on God for good of every kind. He mourns for &s;in, and begs for pardon through Him who died that &s;inners might live. While he avoids exerci&s;ing him&s;elf in things that are too high for him, he makes it his &s;tudy to
<PB N="88" REF="031762_0085_0FEE3D4E2F078918">know and do the will of God&mdash;to maintain &s;obriety&mdash;and to keep alive a devotional tem|per. Taught that he is not his own, and that he is under the wi&s;e, holy and gracious dominion of the &s;overeign Lord of heaven and earth, he denies him&s;elf, he endures af|flictions with patience, he encounters evils with fortitude, and re&s;igns every enjoyment to Him who guides the faithful through this di&s;ciplinary &s;tate. Not intimidated by the frowns, nor allured by the flatteries of the world, he, by divine aid, holds on his cour&s;e till he fini&s;hes it with joy. He daily recounts in his clo&s;et, in &s;ocial prayer, and in medi|tation, the mercies of the &s;upreme benefac|tor, and is awakened to gratitude and prai&s;e. In &s;olitary devotion he &s;huns the notice of mortals, &s;huts the door on the noi&s;e and bu|&s;ine&s;s of the world, and prays to his father who is in &s;ecret. Mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming he is far removed from the o&s;tentatious pa|rade of the ancient Phari&s;ees; who profe&s;&s;ed religion to be &s;een of men, and cho&s;e the corner of the &s;treet, to attract the public no|tice while they recited their forms of devo|tion. The real di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t does not think highly of his own attainments; but in honor prefers his fellow-chri&s;tians to him&s;elf. Knowing that every moral action begins in the heart, he labors to keep it with
<PB N="89" REF="031762_0086_0FEE3D8E494594B8">all diligence, and is incited to watchfulne&s;s. Being a con&s;tant witne&s;s of remaining in|ward corruptions, he cen&s;ures him&s;elf in thou&s;ands of in&s;tances where he &s;tands ac|quitted in the eyes of mankind.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY breathes a kind, meek, and forgiving &s;pirit. The heart of him who is under its influence is moved at the cry of di&s;tre&s;s, and his hand is open, according to his ability, to &s;upply the wants of the poor, and to alleviate the mi&s;eries of the wretched. In alm&s;giving he does not &s;ound a trumpet before him, but, as much as po&s;&s;ible, di&s;pen|&s;es his benefactions in &s;ecret. He does not indulge envy, malice, or revenge; but &s;trives to overcome evil with good. He is not un|der the government of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which cha&s;tity forbids, but looks with abhorrence upon them; as unfitting the mind for pure enjoyment, and the inlet of innumerable e|vils to the human race. In his intercour&s;e with mankind, he is ju&s;t in his dealings, faith|ful to his engagements, and the fulfilment of the duties of his particular tru&s;t. He bears on his mind and heart the words of Chri&s;t, in Matthew vii. 12. <HI>Therefore all things what|&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them: for this is the law and the
<PB N="90" REF="031762_0087_0FEE3E8195A10878">prophets.</HI> The &s;pirit of chri&s;tian virtue tends to the diffu&s;ion of peace and happine&s;s thro' families, &s;ocieties, and the great brotherhood of man. How far do the mo&s;t improved in the family of Chri&s;t on the earth, fall &s;hort of the pattern exhibited by his doctrine and example! But imperfect as his followers are, the internal beauty of the go&s;pel remains; and its influences upon them &s;peak in its prai&s;e. It is a part of its peculiar glory, to train up men from &s;mall beginnings of holi|ne&s;s to a &s;tate of perfect purity and joy.</P>
<P>IN a review of the argument in &s;upport of the in&s;piration of the Bible from the reli|gion it contains, it is natural to inquire whence came &s;uch a &s;cheme of faith and practice?. Where did Mo&s;es and the I&s;rael|ites get &s;uch ideas of Deity as are exhibited in the Old Te&s;tament? They did not derive them from Egypt; for that kingdom was overrun with idolatry during their abode in it. They could not acquire their theology from any of the nations that bordered on Egypt, or Canaan, or from any other then on the earth; for they were all involved in the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, and remained in that &s;tate until the days of the Apo&s;tles. Hence, the &s;acred writers who followed Mo|&s;es could not have been enlightened in the
<PB N="91" REF="031762_0088_0FEE3E83264881B0">knowledge and wor&s;hip of the one living and true God, by any men on the earth. It is well known that the heathens hold to a va&s;t number of gods. Athens&mdash;learned and po|lite Athens, is &s;aid to have acknowledged deities to the number of thirty thou&s;and. The objects to which pagans have paid di|vine homage, were, many of them fabricated by art; and to all their gods have been attri|buted &s;en&s;ual appetites, and pa&s;&s;ions, or affec|tions, unworthy of divinity. They are rep|re&s;ented by tho&s;e who adore them, as enga|ged in the amours of the libidinous, and as parties in the quarrels of proud and mali|cious men. Many of the heathen rituals enjoined the offering of human &s;acrifices; and others encouraged drunkenne&s;s, ob|&s;cenity, and whoredom. Some of the wi&s;er men among the pagans have confe&s;&s;ed the need of a &s;upernatural revelation, to teach mankind how to wor&s;hip the Deity aright. Modern infidels have gloried in the wi&s;dom of a heathen Socrates. He was indeed one of the mo&s;t de&s;erving characters that can be found in the annals of pagan antiquity. This renowned philo&s;opher,
<Q>meeting Al|cibiades, who was going to the temple to pray, proves to him that he knew not how to perform that duty aright, and that therefore it was not &s;afe for him to do
<PB N="92" REF="031762_0089_0FEE3E8C615DABF8">it; but that he &s;hould wait for a divine in&s;tructor to teach him how to behave both towards the gods and men; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary that God &s;hould &s;catter the darkne&s;s which covered his &s;oul, that he might be put in a condition to di&s;|cern good and evil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's View of dei&s;tical writers, in 2 vol. page 11th of vol.

But to return, I further a&s;k, whence came the doctrine of the atone|ment, of the re&s;urrection, and of the future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, as contain|ed in the &s;criptures? Who communicated the piety and virtue which are de&s;cribed and recommended in the&s;e writings? No one who is acquainted with the pagan theology, can, with the lea&s;t colour of rea&s;on, pretend that the religion of the Bible was copied from the religion of idolaters. Does the &s;pirit of the book, who&s;e divine original I am endeavoring to maintain, carry the air of human invention? Good men would not impo&s;e a forgery on the world for truth.
<PB N="93" REF="031762_0090_0FEE3D1BAFFA1EA8">Bad men could not have a &s;ingle motive to prompt them to devi&s;e &s;uch a &s;cheme of faith and practice: For had they knowledge equal to the ta&s;k, they would not have em|ployed it in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a plan, which expo&s;es and condemns them in its whole de&s;ign.

And the Lord gave the people favor in the &s;ight of the Egyptians, &s;o that they lent unto them &s;uch things as they re|quired; and they &s;poiled the Egyptians." It has been &s;aid that this conduct is not re|concileable with truth or ju&s;tice, and there|fore God could not authorize it as Mo&s;es declares; and that by certain con&s;equence it mu&s;t follow, that the book which contains the licence for &s;uch practice cannot be given by divine in&s;piration. To remove this ob|jection it may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT the Egyptians had long held the I&s;raelites in cruel bondage, and, in point
<PB N="97" REF="031762_0093_0FEE3E995F0F9960">of ju&s;tice, owed them a large compen&s;ation in property, for their &s;ervice; and to a higher amount than they actually received.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THE Hebrew verb rendered <HI>borrow,</HI> in the foregoing pa&s;&s;ages, literally &s;ignifies to <HI>a&s;k;</HI> and is &s;o tran&s;lated in general.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii. 29. Deut. iv. 32. xxxii. 7. Jo&s;hua iv. 6. Judges xviii. 5. 1 Sam. xii. 19. P&s;alm ii. 8. I&s;aiah vii. 11.</NOTE> Ac|cording to this ver&s;ion the difficulty is at once removed. The I&s;raelites had certainly an equitable claim on the Egyptians their oppre&s;&s;ors; and on that ground might a&s;k of them precious jewels and raiment.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. THE difficulty does not appear in|&s;urmountable, if we allow the word <HI>borrow</HI> to &s;tand, as in the Bible which we have in our hands. The I&s;raelites were not holden, by any engagement of theirs to return the loan, until they &s;hould reach Mount Sinai, where they were to wor&s;hip Jehovah their deliverer. But previou&s;ly to their arrival at that place, Pharaoh and his ho&s;t pur&s;ued them with a ho&s;tile de&s;ign. The Lord in|terpo&s;ed and cut off the king with his army, by drowning them in the red &s;ea. The I&s;|raelites could be ju&s;tified in retaining the jewels and the raiment in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as the property of a public enemy. Under the
<PB N="98" REF="031762_0094_0FEE3E9B03588D58">exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, what they fir&s;t re|ceived in a way of loan, became &s;poil, and hence their obligation to return it cea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. SINCE the earth is the Lord's and the fulne&s;s thereof, he may transfer his gifts, in an extraordinary, as well as in an ordina|ry, manner, if he plea&s;e. The plagues in|flicted on the Egyptians in their own coun|try, and their overthrow at the red &s;ea, &s;er|ved as &s;o many miraculous atte&s;tations in &s;upport of the equitable claim of the people whom they had &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed, upon their goods; and authorized the redeemed na|tion in holding the jewels and the raiment, which had been put into their hands. None can ju&s;tly plead the ca&s;e we have been con|&s;idering as a precedent to redre&s;s their wrongs in the &s;ame way, unle&s;s they can produce miracles in their ju&s;tification, as convincing as tho&s;e that were wrought for the deliverance of the I&s;raelites from their Egyptian bondage. The Lord brought them forth with a mighty hand, and with an out&s;tretched arm, and with great terrible|ne&s;s, and with &s;igns, and with wonders. The wrath of Jehovah was awfully di&s;play|ed in the puni&s;hment of the Egyptians. Ru|in was &s;pread over the face of their land, mourning for the death of their fir&s;t-born
<PB N="99" REF="031762_0095_0FEE3E9CA9475E18">was heard from every hou&s;e, and they were &s;poiled of their choice&s;t trea&s;ures. The Lord brought forth his people "with &s;ilver and gold; and there was not one feeble per&s;on among their tribes. Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them fell up|on them."</P>
<P>I PROCEED to con&s;ider the difficulty ari|&s;ing from the command which Jehovah gave to the children of I&s;rael, to de&s;troy the in|habitants of Canaan. This objection has been accounted the mo&s;t &s;pecious of any that has been brought again&s;t the divine origin|al of the Bible; and has been much in&s;i&s;ted on by dei&s;ts. They have confidently af|firmed, that the I&s;raelites could have no ju&s;t authority to go into Canaan, cut off its in|habitants by the &s;word, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country; and that if it be admitted that the I&s;raelites had righteou&s;ne&s;s on their &s;ide, in thus treating a people at peace with them, it will follow that any nation may de|prive another of all that is dear to them as men, without violating the law of benevo|lence. The enemies of divine revelation have al&s;o dwelt much on the command for the <HI>total</HI> exci&s;ion of the Canaanites, without re&s;pect to age or &s;ex, as breathing a &s;pirit of cruelty, and therefore unworthy of God.
<PB N="100" REF="031762_0096_0FEE3EA712F77800">I have been the more careful in calling up this objection in its full &s;trength, becau&s;e of the temporary embarra&s;&s;ment it has occa|&s;ioned in &s;o many minds, when they have begun to inquire into the authority of the &s;criptures. To a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing the diffi|culty, let the following things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE character of the Canaanites, whom the children of I&s;rael were command|ed to de&s;troy. From the account given of them in &s;acred hi&s;tory, it appears that they were gro&s;s idolaters, and were addicted to vices of the mo&s;t enormous kind. They con&s;ulted with familiar &s;pirits, and practi&s;ed the arts of &s;orcery and witchcraft. There was not a crime that agreed with their un|bridled lu&s;ts, which they did not &s;anction by their idolatrous rites. <HI>Even their &s;ons and their daughters they burnt in the fire to their gods.</HI> They lived in the open indulgence of fornication, ince&s;t, and the &s;in of Sodom. They even defiled them&s;elves with the bea&s;ts of the field. Hence Jehovah gave the fol|lowing prohibitory precept to the I&s;raelites, "Defile not your&s;elves in any of the&s;e things; for in all the&s;e the nations are de|filed which I ca&s;t out before you. And the land is defiled: therefore I do vi&s;it the ini|quity thereof upon it, and the land it&s;elf
<PB N="101" REF="031762_0097_0FEE3F239A44DA80">vomitteth out her inhabitants."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 12. Lev. xviii.</NOTE> I know not whether it be po&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent a na|tion in a more odious light, than by the fig|ure of their land <HI>vomitting them out,</HI> as too loath&s;ome to endure on its &s;urface.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. IT is evident from the national character of the Canaanites, that they ju&s;tly de&s;erved de&s;truction from the hand of God. His purity and ju&s;tice forbid the la&s;ting pro&s;|perity of a nation of profligates. The Lord did not &s;uffer the Canaanites to be de&s;troy|ed, until they had ripened them&s;elves for ruin by ob&s;tinate wickedne&s;s. Near five hundred years before their conque&s;t by Jo&s;hua, when God renewed the promi&s;e to Abraham, that his &s;eed &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s their land, he declared that there would be a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the performance until &s;everal fu|ture generations were pa&s;&s;ed away; and for the following rea&s;on&mdash;<HI>The iniquity of the Am|orites is not yet full.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xv. 16.</NOTE> The righteous Lord did not &s;uffer them to be cut off till their &s;ins had long cried aloud for vengeance. Hence, he cautions his people, as in Deut. ix. 4. "Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath ca&s;t them out from before thee, &s;aying, For my righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="102" REF="031762_0098_0FEE3EA8A6ED7828">the Lord hath brought me in to po&s;&s;e&s;s this land; but for the wickedne&s;s of the&s;e na|tions the Lord doth drive them out from before thee."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. IF the Canaanites ju&s;tly de&s;erved de&s;truction from the hand of God, it mu&s;t belong to him to appoint the manner of in|flicting it. No one will contend but that the Lord might ju&s;tly have wa&s;ted them, both old and young, by &s;ickne&s;s, or famine, or have &s;unk them by an earthquake: or have de&s;troyed them by evils of a &s;imilar na|ture. None can deny that towns and cities have been overthrown in &s;uch ways, invol|ving each &s;ex and every age, without di&s;|crimination. The heart that murmurs at the providence which orders &s;uch events, as being neither con&s;i&s;tent with rectitude nor goodne&s;s, is actuated by the &s;pirit of athei&s;m.</P>
<P>As the execution of the &s;entence again&s;t the wicked lies wholly in the brea&s;t of the &s;upreme Judge, no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why He might not employ the arms of the I&s;raelites, in cutting off the ancient inhabit|ants of Canaan. Intelligent creatures are as fully under his direction and control as the material world. Be&s;ides, when the former are u&s;ed as the in&s;truments in pun|i&s;hing, the tokens of the divine wrath are
<PB N="103" REF="031762_0099_0FEE3EAA43B1CD00">con&s;idered as more explicit and dreadful than when evils come through other chan|nels. When David was directed to choo&s;e out of war, famine, or pe&s;tilence, the &s;courge to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his &s;in in numbering I&s;|rael, he prayed that he might not fall into the hand of man.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. THAT the I&s;raelites were commi&s;|&s;ioned by Jehovah to de&s;troy the Canaanites, is manife&s;t from their hi&s;tory, after their de|parture from Egypt to their pa&s;&s;ing over Jordan. The divine miraculous interpo&s;i|tions in their behalf, e&s;tabli&s;hes their com|mi&s;&s;ion beyond all rea&s;onable doubt; when taken in connexion with the promi&s;es God made to Abraham, and other patriarchs who de&s;cended from him, that the land of Ca|naan &s;hould be given to the po&s;terity of Ja|cob for an inheritance. From the words of Rahab the harlot, to the two &s;pies whom Jo&s;hua &s;ent to Jericho, it appears that the inhabitants of Canaan expected that the I&s;|raelites would conquer and po&s;&s;e&s;s their country, from the wonders wrought for their defence in the wilderne&s;s. Jo&s;hua ii. 9&mdash;11. "And &s;he &s;aid unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint becau&s;e of
<PB N="104" REF="031762_0100_0FEE3EB461482C10">you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the red &s;ea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other &s;ide Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly de&s;troyed. And, as &s;oon as we had heard the&s;e things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, becau&s;e of you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</P>
<P>No objection can remain again&s;t the man|ner of de&s;troying the Canaanites, after can|didly attending to their character and de&s;ert, the right of the &s;upreme Judge in appoint|ing the in&s;truments of his vengeance, and the full proof that is furni&s;hed in &s;upport of the commi&s;&s;ion given to the I&s;raelites, to cut off tho&s;e abandoned nations, and to plant them&s;elves in their land.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould inquire why the in&s;tance we have been con&s;idering, may not be plead in favor of the Spaniards in de&s;troying the aborigines of Mexico and Peru, under Cor|tez and Pizarro, I an&s;wer, that it does not appear that tho&s;e American Indians were e|qually corrupt with the ancient Canaanites; but on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they were, the Spaniards never had an immediate grant
<PB N="105" REF="031762_0101_0FEE30D783E38778">from the &s;upreme King, of the countries they invaded, nor had they a divine com|mi&s;&s;ion to kill or en&s;lave the inhabitants. Tho&s;e avaricious Europeans could not pro|duce miraculous evidence in &s;upport of their claim, or of the war they carried on to ac|quire the lands and the gold of the natives; therefore they were guilty of robbery and murder. They could not derive the lea&s;t countenance from the principles that ju&s;tify the conque&s;t of Canaan by Jo&s;hua.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould pretend to vindicate the ini|quitous traffic in the human &s;pecies, that has been carried on for three hundred years pa&s;t, by the command for the exci&s;ion of the Ca|naanites, let them &s;upport their cau&s;e by miracles as &s;triking as tho&s;e that were wrought in favor of the children of I&s;rael, in the days of Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua. Let the men who are exploring the coa&s;ts of Africa in que&s;t of &s;laves, open a pa&s;&s;age to go on dry ground through wide and deep waters, and arre&s;t the motions of our planetary &s;y&s;tem, by &s;tretching out their hands, or lifting up their voice&mdash;I &s;ay, let them perform the&s;e or &s;imilar miracles in expre&s;s &s;upport of their de&s;ign, or let them de&s;i&s;t from carry|ing mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s to tho&s;e &s;hores,
<PB N="106" REF="031762_0102_0FEE3EB611085618">as they would avoid the guilt of man-&s;teal|ing, and of &s;hedding innocent blood.</P>
<P>IN the de&s;truction of the Canaanites, &s;ol|emn warnings were given to the people of I&s;rael, and to all other nations to whom the &s;criptures are known, again&s;t idola|try and vice. Is it not worthy of the holi|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of God to give &s;uch warnings to mankind? Did he not di&s;|play his moral perfections by the deluge, and other judgments recorded in &s;cripture hi&s;tory? The mind of Abraham mu&s;t have been deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a belief in the holy maje&s;ty of Jehovah, when early in the morning in which Sodom and Gomorrah were wrapped in flames, he beheld the &s;moke of the country going up, as the &s;moke of a furnace. The Lord will make ungodly na|tions to drink the cup of his wrath. Jere. xxv. 31. "A noi&s;e &s;hall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a contro|ver&s;y with the nations; he will plead with all fle&s;h; he will give them that are wicked to the &s;word, &s;aith the Lord."</P>
<P>HAVING attempted to obviate the forego|ing objections, I proceed to introduce a <HI>&s;ec|ond</HI> argument in &s;upport of the in&s;piration of the &s;criptures, taken from the miracles which they narrate. To the&s;e, appeals have
<PB N="107" REF="031762_0103_0FEE3EB7A46E1490">already been made, but their nature and de|&s;ign de&s;erve a more particular con&s;idera|tion; as well as the principal periods of &s;a|cred hi&s;tory in which they were wrought.</P>
<P>A MIRACLE is an event contrary to the laws of nature, or the &s;tated cour&s;e of di|vine operation, and is addre&s;&s;ed to the exter|nal &s;en&s;es of mankind. A miracle is as per|fectly within the reach of omnipotence, or is wrought with the &s;ame ea&s;e, as any other thing that is brought into exi&s;tence. Should the Almighty now command the &s;un to ri&s;e in the we&s;t in&s;tead of the ea&s;t, the event would be miraculous, becau&s;e it is contrary to what are denominated the laws of na|ture. If water were to a&s;cend a cataract, it would be a rever&s;ion of its common cour&s;e, and therefore a miracle. The miracles re|corded in the &s;criptures, were perceived by tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent when they were per|formed, through the medium of their bodily organs. Thus, the appearances and the voice at Mount Sinai, when the law was giv|en, &s;truck the &s;en&s;es of the I&s;raelites. When Chri&s;t walked on the &s;ea of Galilee, his di&s;|ciples were eye-witne&s;&s;es. No train of rea|&s;oning is nece&s;&s;ary to convince the &s;pectators when a miracle is performed. Its &s;udden, extraordinary nature arre&s;ts the attention,
<PB N="108" REF="031762_0104_0FEE3EBFF569E3A0">like the fir&s;t appearance of a blazing comet, or the noi&s;e of thunder.</P>
<P>THE apparent de&s;ign of miracles is to &s;ummon the attention of mankind, to &s;ome doctrine or duty, revealed or enjoined by Je|hovah; and at the &s;ame time to prove that the per&s;ons who deliver the truths or the laws, are commi&s;&s;ioned by him. When God &s;ends me&s;&s;engers with &s;uch credentials, their me&s;&s;age is clothed with his authority, and demands our faith and obedience. Mir|acles, though mo&s;t &s;triking to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent when they were wrought, may be &s;o well atte&s;ted, as to an&s;wer the &s;ame general purpo&s;es to others down to the end of the world. They were of high and ab&s;o|lute importance in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ations. To this general de&s;ign may be reduced all the mira|cles recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, and in the New.</P>
<P>WE have no rea&s;on to expect the renewal of miracles; becau&s;e the canon of &s;cripture has long &s;ince been clo&s;ed. The preci&s;e pe|riod in which miracles cea&s;ed, I pretend not to determine: But we have no evidence that they were continued beyond the infan|cy of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="031762_0105_0FEE3EC18E7581F0">
LET us attend to &s;ome of the miracles wrought by Mo&s;es. While he was in exile in the land of Midian, where he continued forty years, he led his flock to the back-&s;ide of the de&s;ert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. To this humble &s;hep|herd the Angel of the Lord appeared, in a flame of fire, out of the mid&s;t of a bu&s;h; and he looked, and, behold, the bu&s;h burn|ed with fire, and was not con&s;umed. As he turned a&s;ide to &s;ee this great &s;ight, Jeho|vah called to him out of the mid&s;t of the bu&s;h, and commanded him to go down into Egypt, to deliver the children of I&s;rael from their cruel bondage, and to conduct them unto the good land that he had promi&s;ed to give them. Mo&s;es di&s;covered great reluc|tance, at fir&s;t, in entering on the work a&s;&s;ign|ed him; and urged that his nation would not believe him, but would &s;ay, "The LORD hath not appeared unto thee." Je|hovah directed him to ca&s;t the rod in his hand on the ground. He obeyed; it be|came a &s;erpent; and he &s;led from before it. By the &s;ame authority, he caught it by the tail, and it again became a rod in his hand. He was next commanded to put his hand in|to his bo&s;om; and when he took it out it was leprous as &s;now. He was ordered to put
<PB N="110" REF="031762_0106_0FEE30F83A466560">his hand into his bo&s;om again; and on his plucking it out the &s;econd time, it was cur|ed, and re&s;umed the &s;ame appearance with his other fle&s;h. Convinced by the&s;e two &s;igns, as well as by other things, of his duty to undertake in the arduous work of deliver|ing I&s;rael from bondage, he with Aaron his brother, went down into Egypt, in obedience to the divine command. It appears from the hi&s;tory recorded in Exodus, that Mo&s;es, after his long exile, had given up the ex|pectation which he had entertained forty years before, of delivering the I&s;raelites, and that they were looking out for no &s;uch thing. This greatly &s;trengthens the credibility of the &s;tory. On the refu&s;al of Pharaoh to re|lea&s;e the I&s;raelites from bondage, according to the demand which Jehovah directed Mo|&s;es to make, Aaron ca&s;t down the rod, which had undergone miraculous changes at Ho|reb, and it became a &s;erpent, in pre&s;ence of the Egyptian monarch and his mini&s;ters. Other miracles were afterwards wrought; in turning the waters of Egypt into blood, in filling the land with frogs, and with &s;warms of flies, in the plagues of the hail, and the locu&s;ts, in bringing on a thick dark|ne&s;s over the land of three days continuance, and to name no more, in the death of the fir&s;t born, both of man and bea&s;t, through|out
<PB N="111" REF="031762_0107_0FEE3EC31E91F168">the realm, in one night. The&s;e mira|cles, in connexion with tho&s;e afterwards performed at the red &s;ea, at Mount Sinai, and other places, until the cho&s;en people were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land of prom|i&s;e, abundantly e&s;tabli&s;h the in&s;piration of the Old Te&s;tament. Additional proofs of the &s;ame kind were afforded, from the con|que&s;t of Canaan till the days of the prophet Daniel. When Mo&s;es, a little before his death, was exhorting the children of I&s;rael to keep the &s;tatutes and commandments of the Lord, he reminded them of the extraor|dinary manner in which God had redeemed them from Egypt, and revealed his will, as high motives for their obedience. He ap|pealed to the &s;igns and wonders which had been &s;hown and wrought before their nation, in proof that their Almighty Redeemer was the only true God, and that their religion was from him. Deut. iv. 32&mdash;40.
<Q>For a&s;k now of the days that are pa&s;t, which were before thee, &s;ince the day that God created man upon the earth; and a&s;k from the one &s;ide of heaven unto the oth|er, whether there hath been any &s;uch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever people hear the voice of God &s;peaking out of the mid&s;t of the fire, as thou ha&s;t heard, and live?
<PB N="112" REF="031762_0108_0FEE30D5E81E10B8">Or hath God a&s;&s;ayed to go and take him a nation from the mid&s;t of another nation, by temptations, by &s;igns, and by won|ders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a &s;tretched-out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? Unto thee it was &s;hewed, that thou mighte&s;t know that the Lord he is God; there is none el&s;e be&s;ides him.

<P>WHETHER the magicians, mentioned in Exod. vii. and viii. performed real miracles, is a que&s;tion which has often been brought up in attending to the miracles of Mo&s;es; and has been differently an&s;wered by divines of high reputation in the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>THOSE who adopt the affirmative &s;ide of the foregoing que&s;tion, admit that the evi|dence is eventually full and deci&s;ive in &s;up|port of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es; be|cau&s;e that the magicians were early con|founded in their conte&s;t with him, and were brought to confe&s;s that Mo&s;es was furni&s;hed with divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. My limits will not permit me to enter largely into this &s;ubject; I &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t a few rea&s;ons again&s;t the hypothe&s;is, that the magicians perfor|med real miracles.</P>

IF real miracles are admitted to be wrought on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who are enga|ged for the &s;upport of error and wickedne&s;s, as the &s;uppo&s;ed miracles of the magicians in Egypt were, it will be very difficult to &s;how how miracles do in any ca&s;e confirm the di|vine mi&s;&s;ion of any per&s;on, or the divine au|thority

Nicode|mus, in the third chapter of John, appears to have &s;poken not only according to the be|lief of the Jews, but agreeably to the dictates of the human mind, when he &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <HI>We know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do the&s;e miracles that thou doe&s;t except God be with him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. MOSES di&s;covers no marks of di&s;|couragement from any thing that the magi|cians are &s;uppo&s;ed to have done, in turning their rods into &s;erpents, water into blood, or in bringing up frogs upon the land. But con&s;idering his very great diffidence in un|dertaking the arduous work to which he was called while in Midian, would he not have been greatly agitated, and have been ready to de&s;pond, if he had believed that the ma|gicians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power to do mir|acles? How would he have relied on the &s;ign of changing <HI>his</HI> rod into a &s;erpent, as a proof of his divine commi&s;&s;ion, as the Lord had told him, if the magicians could al&s;o turn <HI>their</HI> rods into &s;erpents?</P>
<P N="3">3dly. WHATEVER the magicians did, they never went fir&s;t in performing any wonder; but they in their operations always <HI>followed</HI> Mo&s;es. It is certainly much ea&s;ier to imi|tate than to take the lead, in any thing either
<PB N="115" REF="031762_0111_0FEE3ED13A5522D0">great or rare. Men who compo&s;ed an order of &s;uch antiquity and repute among the heathens, as were the magicians, mu&s;t have acquired a dexterity in their art, which far &s;urpa&s;&s;es any thing that has fallen under our notice.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. IT plainly appears to us, even at this di&s;tance of time and place from the &s;cene in Pharaoh's court, that in two of the three in&s;tances in which the magicians imi|tated Mo&s;es, they wrought on a much &s;mal|ler &s;cale than he did. When Aaron &s;tretch|ed out the rod over the waters of Egypt, the Lord cau&s;ed their &s;treams, rivers, ponds, and all their pools to become blood; and they remained in that &s;tate &s;even days. The E|gyptians, in that time of di&s;tre&s;s, opened wells or &s;prings to procure water to drink. The magicians could have but a &s;mall quan|tity of water to operate upon. At the in|&s;tant of time when Mo&s;es did his miracle there was no water for them to change, &s;o much as in ve&s;&s;els of wood or &s;tone. They might afterwards by their art cau&s;e the wa|ter taken from a newly opened &s;pring or well, to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of blood. It is affirmed by &s;ome great naturali&s;ts now living that a &s;mall quantity of water may be made to appear red like blood, by the efforts
<PB N="116" REF="031762_0112_0FEE3ED2DB403A10">of art. In the in&s;tance of the frogs the ma|gicians could do very little; becau&s;e Mo&s;es had before cau&s;ed them to go up from the waters of Egypt, and to cover the land.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. PHARAOH is con&s;idered as more criminal for not letting the I&s;raelites depart from their bondage, on account of the &s;igns and wonders which were &s;hown by Mo&s;es and Aaron, even while the magicians imita|ted their miracles. As a proof of this we need only advert to what is &s;aid concerning the Egyptian monarch, that <HI>he hardened his heart,</HI> or that <HI>his heart was hardened.</HI> If the magicians did as real miracles as Mo&s;es, how could Pharaoh's guilt have been increa&s;ed in holding the children of I&s;rael in &s;lavery, again&s;t the light reflected upon his under|&s;tanding and con&s;cience by what Mo&s;es did? What evidence could Pharaoh collect from &s;igns, which were performed by tho&s;e who demanded the relea&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, if his wi&s;e men who de&s;igned by their wonderful works to countenance him in his conduct, wrought as real miracles as were performed by Mo&s;es and Aaron? If it &s;hould be &s;aid that the miracles performed by the&s;e la&s;t exceeded tho&s;e wrought by the magi|cians, and therefore Pharaoh was the more criminal in refu&s;ing to let I&s;rael go, it may
<PB N="117" REF="031762_0113_0FEE3ED7617EBCD0">be an&s;wered, that according to this hypoth|e&s;is, there was divine evidence again&s;t divine evidence; which is ab&s;urd and contradicto|ry. Be&s;ides, if Mo&s;es exceeded the magi|cians for the pre&s;ent, while the conte&s;t be|tween them continued, how could Pharaoh determine before the trial clo&s;ed, that the latter would not in a future in&s;tance get the victory over the former? While there was room to doubt, the Egyptian monarch could not be blamed for waiting the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t; and con&s;equently his guilt would not have been increa&s;ed by the miracles of Mo&s;es, during the performance of counter miracles. There appears to be no way to avoid the&s;e difficulties, but that of denying that the magicians wrought real miracles.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. PHARAOH never applied to the magicians to take away the plagues while they imitated Mo&s;es; but in every in&s;tance to the latter. He could not be influenced to this conduct by his native inclination or in|tere&s;t. How can this behaviour of his be accounted for, except on the ground, that he was compelled to believe that Mo&s;es only was endowed with miraculous powers?</P>
<P N="7">7thly. THE magicians are expre&s;sly &s;aid, in the three in&s;tances in which they imitated Mo&s;es, to have wrought <HI>with their inchant|ments.</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="031762_0114_0FEE3EDF250AD190">The original word rendered <HI>inchant|ments,</HI> in Exodus vii. and viii. is derived from a verb which &s;ignifies <HI>to hide,</HI> or <HI>conceal,</HI> and the plural noun derived from it, &s;ignifies <HI>in|cantations,</HI> or <HI>charms,</HI> or <HI>juggling tricks;</HI> where|by true appearances are covered, and fal&s;e ones are impo&s;ed on the eyes of the &s;pecta|tors. The divine law forbids the u&s;e of this art; Levit. xix. 26. "Ye &s;hall not eat any thing with the blood; <HI>neither &s;hall ye u&s;e in|chantment,</HI> nor ob&s;erve times." The &s;er|vants of Jehovah did not indulge &s;uch ope|rations. Even Balaam, when he found him|&s;elf compelled to ble&s;s the people of I&s;rael, in&s;tead of cur&s;ing them according to the wi&s;hes of his heart, "went not as at other times <HI>to &s;eek for inchantments.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiv. 1.</NOTE> From the u&s;e of inchantments adopted by the magi|cians in Egypt, it may be fairly concluded that what they did, was performed by the exertion of their art; and that therefore they wrought no miracle.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. WHEN the magicians failed in their attempt to bring forth lice with their inchantments, they &s;aid unto Pharaoh <HI>This is the &s;inger of God;</HI> which confe&s;&s;ion implies that what they had done before was effected by art. It is to be ob&s;erved that the magi|cians
<PB N="119" REF="031762_0115_0FEE3EE0CE1F3818">do not &s;ay, "This is the finger of <HI>the Lord,</HI> or <HI>Jehovah,</HI>" in who&s;e name Mo&s;es did his miracles; but that, "This is the fin|ger of <HI>God.</HI>" The word tran&s;lated <HI>God,</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age, is applicable to any Deity; as we find from the u&s;e of it in the &s;criptures. It may therefore be inferred, that the magi|cians them&s;elves acknowledged that there was no &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of <HI>Deity</HI> in all which they had done.</P>
<P>IF the foregoing arguments are well foun|ded, it mu&s;t appear unnece&s;&s;ary that the &s;a|cred hi&s;torian &s;hould have &s;aid in a formal manner, that the magicians in Egypt wrought no real miracle; &s;ince the &s;ame idea is com|municated by the words which narrate their operations&mdash;<HI>"They did &s;o with their inchant|ments."</HI></P>
<P>THE magicians, and kindred orders of men, might do many &s;trange and marvellous things in the days of Mo&s;es, and they may now; but we &s;eem not to have any evidence that God hath ever wrought a miracle by their hands. When Baal's prophets in the time of Elijah made an effort to call down &s;ire from heaven upon their altar, they were not able to accompli&s;h their wi&s;hes. When the exorci&s;ts, mentioned in Acts xix. un|dertook to ca&s;t out evil &s;pirits by invoking
<PB N="120" REF="031762_0116_0FEE3EE26802A918">the name of Je&s;us, in connexion with their art, they were dreadfully confounded: ver. 15, 16. "And the evil &s;pirit an&s;wered and &s;aid, Je&s;us I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil &s;pirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed again&s;t them, &s;o that they fled out of that hou&s;e naked and wound|ed." Antichri&s;t claims the power of work|ing miracles, but tho&s;e he exhibits, are &s;ti|led, in &s;cripture, <HI>lying wonders;</HI> not only becau&s;e they are de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h here&s;y, but becau&s;e the facts to which he appeals are not of the miraculous kind: as will fully appear to any one who peru&s;es the legends of the Romi&s;h church, together with the writings of the reformers.</P>
<P>HAVING attended to the ca&s;e of the magi|cians, which is the mo&s;t difficult of the kind recorded in the Bible, I need not pay particular attention to that which is con|tained in 1 Samuel xxviii. relative to the re&s;urrection of the prophet by the witch of Endor. She is not to be con&s;idered as a worker of miracles, if &s;ome per&s;on, under the cover of the night was &s;ub&s;tituted by her to announce to Saul his de&s;tiny. This would be wholly the effect of art. Nor can &s;he be ranked among the performers of mir|acles,
<PB N="121" REF="031762_0117_0FEE3EE3F89DE580">if, as is mo&s;t probable, Jehovah inter|po&s;ed and rai&s;ed Samuel, to deliver to the wicked king of I&s;rael his doom. It is I think, obvious from the hi&s;tory, that while the witch was about to practi&s;e the art of divina|tion, the prophet &s;uddenly appeared. If this be admitted as fact, &s;he was in no &s;en&s;e employed as an in&s;trument in producing the miracle.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t miraculous event in the old Te&s;|tament hi&s;tory which I &s;hall con&s;ider, is the one that was performed in the time of the prophet Elijah: Of this we have a particu|lar account in 1 Kings xviii. That prophet lived in the time when Ahab reigned over I&s;rael; a prince who gave him&s;elf up with Jezebel his wife, to idolatry and wickedne&s;s, above all who had been rai&s;ed to the throne before him. A drought of more than three years continuance was &s;ent upon the land, for the wickedne&s;s of the king and his peo|ple; and was followed by a dreadful famine. The prophet Elijah was commi&s;&s;ioned by Jehovah to denounce to Ahab the withhold|ing of the dew and the rain during that gloomy period. Near its clo&s;e he came out of his retirement by divine command, and went boldly to meet the king, who had been
<PB N="122" REF="031762_0118_0FEE2F8A19F46CA8">&s;eeking to find the place where the prophet was &s;heltered, that he might put him to death. "And it came to pa&s;s, when Ahab &s;aw Elijah, that Ahab &s;aid unto him, art thou he that troubleth I&s;rael? And he an&s;wered, I have not troubled I&s;rael, but thou and thy father's hou&s;e, in that ye have for&s;aken the commandments of the Lord, and thou ha&s;t followed Baalim. Now, therefore, &s;end, and gather to me all I&s;rael unto mount Car|mel, and the prophets of Baal four hund|red and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table." Ahab a&s;&s;embled the people and the prophets according to de&s;ire. "And Elijah came unto all the people, and &s;aid, how long halt ye between two opinions, if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him." The people manife&s;ted by their &s;i|lence, that they had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t &s;o rea&s;onable a propo&s;al. "Then &s;aid Eli|jah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them, therefore, give us two bullocks; and let them choo&s;e one bullock for them&s;elves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under; and I will dre&s;s the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under. And call ye on the name of your
<PB N="123" REF="031762_0119_0FEE3EE593F46600">gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the god that an&s;wereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people an|&s;wered and &s;aid it is well &s;poken." The prie&s;ts of Baal took the bullock which they cho&s;e, and prepared and laid it on their altar. They cried to their god from morning to evening, but there was neither voice, nor any to an&s;wer, nor any that regarded. Eli|jah proceeded to repair the altar of the LORD before all the people. He made a trench about it, and laid on the wood and the bullock in order. He commanded wa|ter to be poured upon the burnt-&s;acrifice and the wood: This was done three times. "And the water ran about the altar; and he filled the trench al&s;o with water. And it came to pa&s;s, at the time of the offering of the evening &s;acrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and &s;aid, LORD God of Abra|ham, I&s;aac, and of I&s;rael, let it be known this day that thou art God in I&s;rael, and that I am thy &s;ervant, and that I have done all the&s;e things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou ha&s;t turned their heart back again." The people mu&s;t have waited with anxions de&s;ire to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue&mdash;the controver&s;y decided, whether JEHOVAH or Baal be the true God.
<PB N="124" REF="031762_0120_0FEE3F70162D5670">The &s;u&s;pen&s;e was immediately removed after the prayer of Elijah was clo&s;ed. "The fire of the LORD fell, and con&s;umed the burnt-&s;ac|rifice, and the wood, and the &s;tones, and the du&s;t, and licked up the water that was in the trench." The people felt the deci&s;ion of the controver&s;y&mdash;They could not doubt for a moment. "They fell on their faces, and they &s;aid, THE LORD, HE IS THE GOD! THE LORD, HE IS THE GOD!" In this in|&s;tance we behold in a &s;triking manner, the proof which miracles afford that JEHOVAH is the only true God, and that mankind are under the highe&s;t obligations to wor&s;hip and obey him, as required in his word.</P>
<P>I PASS to the con&s;ideration of &s;ome of the miracles recorded in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THE number of miracles performed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t was much greater than tho&s;e which were done by Mo&s;es, or Elijah, or a|ny who came before him. He went about all the cities and villages in the land of I&s;rael, healing every &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. ix.</NOTE> "His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all &s;ick people that were taken with divers di&s;ea&s;es, and torments, and tho&s;e which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, and tho&s;e which were lunatic, and tho&s;e that had
<PB N="125" REF="031762_0121_0FEE3EF19AB17348">the pal&s;y; and he healed them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. iv. 24.</NOTE> He cured per&s;ons, and that in an in&s;tant, who were deaf, and blind, and dumb, and lame. They immediately recovered their hearing, their &s;ight, their &s;peech, and the u&s;e of their limbs; and remained in a &s;tate of recovery. He removed completely at once, infirmities which had been of many years &s;tanding. This is altogether different from curing by the application of medicine; which is very &s;low in its progre&s;s in overcoming chronic di&s;orders. Chri&s;t re&s;tored &s;oundne&s;s to the body, as well as regularity to the mind, by uttering a word. Many &s;uch miracles as the foregoing were performed in a public manner, and before enemies. He fed four thou&s;and men, be&s;ide women and children, with &s;even loaves of bread, and a few little fi&s;hes; and &s;even ba&s;kets of fragments re|mained. At another time he fed about five thou&s;and men with five loaves and two fi&s;h|es; and twelve ba&s;kets of fragments remain|ed. He &s;ilenced the tempe&s;t by his voice, and he walked on the waves of the &s;ea. He re&s;tored life to the dead. Three in&s;tances are particularly mentioned, viz. the wid|ow's &s;on at Nain, Jairus's daughter at Ca|pernaum, and Lazarus at Bethany. Let us
<PB N="126" REF="031762_0122_0FEE308ACAD43780">be&s;tow our attention for a moment on the&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>WHEN Je&s;us approached the gate of the city of Nain, with many of his di&s;ciples and much people, he met a funeral proce&s;&s;ion. A croud had collected to mourn with a &s;or|rowful mother, in a &s;tate of widowhood, who&s;e only &s;on had fallen a victim to death in the bloom of youth: the corp&s;e was now moving to the land of &s;ilence. The com|pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us was tenderly touched, as he beheld the flowing tears of a &s;olitary widow, mourning for her only &s;on. "He &s;aid unto her, weep not. And he came and touched the bier; and they that bare him &s;tood &s;till." The attention of the throng mu&s;t have been fixed upon this &s;tranger&mdash;Their eyes and their ears were open&mdash;What doth this traveller de|&s;ign! The multitude &s;oon heard and &s;aw with amazement&mdash;He &s;poke with an audible voice, <HI>Young man! I &s;ay unto thee, Ari&s;e!</HI> "And he that was dead &s;at up, and began to &s;peak. And he delivered him to his moth|er." The &s;pectators felt a &s;olemn awe; "and they glorified God, &s;aying, that a great prophet is ri&s;en up among us; and, that God hath vi&s;ited his people."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke vii.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="031762_0123_0FEE3EF336FB35E8">
JAIRUS, a ruler of the &s;ynagogue, had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, who lay a dying. He came to Je&s;us, who was then &s;urrounded by a multitude, and fell at his feet, and with all the di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h which a father feels, when his child appears to be in the agonies of death, be|&s;ought him to go to his hou&s;e to &s;tay the departing &s;pirit. As the great phy&s;ician did not repair to the place &s;o &s;oon as reque&s;ted, word was &s;oon brought him that the maiden was dead, and that he needed not make the vi&s;it lately reque&s;ted. But when Je&s;us heard it, he told the me&s;&s;enger, that &s;he &s;hould be made whole. He went to the melancholy hou&s;e, and found the family weeping and bewailing their dead friend. "He took her by the hand, and called, &s;aying, <HI>Maid! a|ri&s;e!</HI> And her &s;pirit came again, and &s;he aro&s;e &s;traightway."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke viii.</NOTE></P>
<P>LAZARUS of Bethany, was rai&s;ed from the dead after he had lain in the grave four days. This miracle was wrought in pre&s;ence of a great number of &s;pectators. They heard the commanding voice of the Son of God, <HI>Lazarus, come forth!</HI> They &s;aw him coming forth from the grave. Some who were pre&s;ent believed on Je&s;us as the prom|i&s;ed
<PB N="128" REF="031762_0124_0FEE3EF519714670">Me&s;&s;iah; but others went their ways to the Phari&s;ees, and made them acquainted with the miraculous event. Whereupon the Jewi&s;h council was a&s;&s;embled; the mem|bers of which &s;aid to each other "What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans &s;hall come and take away both our place and nation.&mdash;From that day forth, they took coun&s;el together for to put him to death."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a mir|acle, which taken in all its circum&s;tances, is the mo&s;t remarkable of any that was ever wrought in our world, and furni&s;hes the highe&s;t evidence of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, and that the go&s;pel is from God. Je&s;us &s;howed unto his di&s;ciples while he was pur&s;uing his public mini&s;try, that he mu&s;t go up to Jeru|&s;alem, be delivered into the hands of men, &s;uffer many things of the elders, and chief prie&s;ts and &s;cribes, and be killed, and be rai&s;ed again the third day.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xvi. 21. Mark ix. 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAD not Je&s;us Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead, his religion mu&s;t have early peri&s;hed. Its fate would have been the &s;ame with that of the French prophets, a &s;et of enthu&s;ia&s;ts who
<PB N="129" REF="031762_0125_0FEE308C689A3DC8">appeared in England about a hundred years ago. When one of their chiefs lay on his death-bed, and was actually expiring, he told his followers round him that he &s;hould ri&s;e on a certain day and hour; and that if he failed, they mu&s;t conclude that they had been deluded. The day came&mdash;a va&s;t number of people a&s;&s;embled round the grave&mdash;as the hour approached, a noted parti&s;an lifted up his voice, and called to his decea&s;ed friend&mdash;Ri&s;e! Oh ri&s;e! or we are undone! But the clods continued to cover the dead body, and the delu&s;ion was detected in the eyes of the world. If Chri&s;t had not ri&s;en, as he predicted, his cau&s;e would have &s;unk. Saith the Apo&s;tle Paul in 1 Cor. xv. <HI>If Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is al&s;o vain.</HI></P>
<P>THE death of Je&s;us was not in private a|mong his friends, but in public among his enemies; by whom he was executed as a malefactor. When he was taken down from the cro&s;s, his enemies were fully &s;atisfied that he was dead. Life could not have re|mained in him after the Roman &s;oldier had thru&s;t the &s;pear into his &s;ide. His body was lodged in a &s;epulchre hewn out of a rock, a &s;tone was rolled unto its door. By Pilate's order a &s;eal was put upon the &s;tone, and a
<PB N="130" REF="031762_0126_0FEE3EF6AB9A1C00">guard of &s;oldiers was placed by it. On the third day, <HI>Behold, there was a great earth|quake: for the angel of the Lord de&s;cended from heaven, and came and rolled back the &s;tone from the door, and &s;at upon it. His countenance was like lightening, and his raiment white as &s;now. And for fear of him the keepers did &s;hake, and became as dead men.</HI> The angel &s;aid to the women who came unto the &s;epul|chre, Je&s;us who was crucified is not here; <HI>for he is ri&s;en, as he &s;aid. Come, &s;ee the place where the Lord lay.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE women who vi&s;ited the &s;epulchre in the morning after Chri&s;t aro&s;e, did not ex|pect in their &s;etting out to find him alive, for their de&s;ign was to anoint the dead body with the &s;pices they had prepared. None of the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t expected his re&s;ur|rection. They never could under&s;tand du|ring his life how his dying, and to be &s;ure in &s;uch ignominy, was reconcileable with his Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip. They were &s;low to believe in the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, after the event had taken place. The force of evidence a|lone gained their faith. The appearances of Chri&s;t to them were continued at different times and places, when few and many were together, during the cour&s;e of forty days.

<P>THE &s;tory of the watch placed at Chri&s;t's &s;epulchre, <HI>That his di&s;ciples came and &s;tole him away while they &s;lept,</HI> is full of ab&s;urdities. They were hired to tell it by a large &s;um of money given them by the chief prie&s;ts and elders of the Jews. Do men need bribing to tell the truth? Does not the de&s;ign of a bribe always carry in it a wi&s;h to conceal facts? Be&s;ides, as it is well known that tho&s;e who &s;lept on guard, were if detected, pun|i&s;hed by the Roman laws with death, the &s;oldiers would not have dared to confe&s;s them&s;elves a&s;leep when on duty, had not the Jewi&s;h rulers agreed to pacify Pilate on their behalf. Had there been the lea&s;t pretext for the &s;tory the &s;oldiers told, the chief prie&s;ts would have been the fir&s;t men in Judea to bring the watch to puni&s;hment; as that would have given credibility to the account which they &s;trove to propagate. Every thing relative to the conduct of the chief prie&s;ts in this affair, carries fraud in the face of it, and confirms the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection. Moreover, the te&s;ti|mony given by the watch relative to a fact,
<PB N="132" REF="031762_0128_0FEE2F7B145D1AB0">which, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, took place while they were a&s;leep, is of &s;uch a nature, as is wholly inadmi&s;&s;ible before a court of ju&s;|tice, or by the dictates of common &s;en&s;e. Are men to be credited in affirming a fact, which they declare to have happened at a time when they could have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of it? Is there an hone&s;t man of common under&s;tanding upon the globe, who would venture to decide in any thing of con&s;e|quence on &s;uch te&s;timony?</P>
<P>IT has been objected to the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection that he did not &s;how him&s;elf after his death to his judges, and his enemies in general. To obviate this diffi|culty, it may be ob&s;erved, that if Chri&s;t af|ter he left the &s;epulchre had gone into their pre&s;ence, they probably would, from the malice and blindne&s;s they had di&s;covered, have con&s;idered the appearance as an idle dream; and have remained as ob&s;tinate as they were after the re&s;urrection of Lazarus. But let us &s;uppo&s;e that by &s;uch an appear|ance they had all been gained over to the belief of the fact, and had become Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, would not the enemies of the go&s;|pel have &s;aid, that &s;ince all the great men in the nation had received it, the whole was a contrived plan, and therefore ought to be given up as a cunningly devi&s;ed fable?
<PB N="133" REF="031762_0129_0FEE3EA583A60178">This objection would have carried much more plau&s;ibility in it than any that can now be urged. Chri&s;tianity did not ri&s;e up un|der the patronage of the powerful and the great. It was left to work its way in the world by its internal evidence, and the gra|cious aids of its founder. Several per&s;ons of learning and note were converted to it in its infancy; among the&s;e was Saul of Tar&s;us; but they became friends to the go&s;pel in a way that gives not the lea&s;t coun|tenance to the &s;ugge&s;tion, that it owed its birth to the wi&s;dom of this world. Chri&s;t crucified was to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>WITHIN a &s;hort time after Chri&s;t's re&s;|urrection, his di&s;ciples publicly and boldly proclaimed it in Jeru&s;alem, where he was put to death; and wrought miracles on the ground that he was alive. They went forth and preached this doctrine every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with &s;igns following.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, we have deci&s;ive evidence from the miracles of Mo&s;es and the Proph|ets, and from tho&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;pi|ration of God.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE V. The evidence from the Prophecies con&s;id|ered; &s;everal popular objections an&s;wer|ed; and the di&s;cour&s;es concluded with an improvement.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>2 TIMOTHY iii. 16.</BIBL>
<P><HI>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor|rection, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the two la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, arguments were introduced to prove the divine in&s;pira|tion of the &s;criptures, from the nature of the religion they contain, and the miracles re|corded in them. I now proceed to a <HI>third</HI> argument, derived from the fulfilment of their prophecies.</P>
<P>BY prophecy is meant, the foretelling of events that are not within the reach of hu|man probability, and of which no knowledge
<PB N="136" REF="031762_0131_0FEE3F01E2E8B0F8">can be obtained beforehand but from God. To look into futurity and di&s;cern &s;uch e|vents, with the time and circum&s;tances of their coming into exi&s;tence, is peculiar to the infinite mind. I&s;aiah xlvi. 9, 10. <HI>Re|member the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none el&s;e; I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the be|ginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, &s;aying, My coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the &s;criptures abound with proph|ecies, will be denied by none who have read them. The prophecies are &s;o interwoven with the &s;acred writings, as not to be &s;epa|rated. If the predictions were not delivered before the events which they hold up as fu|ture, had happened, we mu&s;t give up the Bible, and con&s;ider it as a forgery. But if the prophets were let into the &s;ecrets of fu|turity, as we have abundant evidence from the fulfilment of their predictions, they were immediately enlightened from on high, and the &s;criptures are demon&s;trated to be the word of the Lord. It has been often pro|ved that the prophecies re&s;pecting the cap|tivity of the Jews in Babylon, the coming of Je&s;us of Nazareth, the de&s;truction of Je|ru&s;alem by the Romans, and many others,
<PB N="137" REF="031762_0132_0FEE3F0382FD1360">were deliverd prior to the events which an|&s;wer to them. The argument in favor of the divine original of the Bible from prophecy, carries irre&s;i&s;tible force, when we reflect on the conduct of providence in fulfilling pre|dictions at the pre&s;ent time, which all will grant were written and publi&s;hed many ages ago. To two prophecies of this kind, I now call your attention.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with the prophecy con|cerning I&s;hmael, Abraham's &s;on by Hagar, recorded in Gen. xvi. As that woman was wandering in the wilderne&s;s,
<Q>The angel of the Lord &s;aid unto her, I will multiply thy &s;eed exceedingly, that it &s;hall not be numbered for multitude.&mdash;Behold, thou art with child, and &s;halt bear a &s;on, and &s;halt call his name I&s;hmael; becau&s;e the Lord hath heard thy affliction. And he will be a wild man; his hand will be a|gain&s;t every man, and every man's hand again&s;t him: and he &s;hall dwell in the pre&s;ence of all his brethren.</Q> This pre|diction principally relates to I&s;hmael's po&s;|terity; but a &s;mall part of it, be&s;ide his birth, could have any accompli&s;hment in his per&s;on. A numerous &s;eed de&s;cended from him, which remain to this day. It is &s;aid of
<PB N="138" REF="031762_0133_0FEE3F1037966090">his de&s;cendants, in Gen. xxv. 18. That "they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goe&s;t towards A&s;|&s;yria." The place here a&s;&s;igned to them is the &s;ame with what was afterwards in &s;crip|ture called <HI>Arabia,</HI> and continues to have the &s;ame name, and to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame people, to the pre&s;ent time. The A|rabians have never been conquered either by the A&s;&s;yrians, Per&s;ians, Greeks, Romans, Tartars, or any other nation. They have always been a pe&s;t to mankind, and have practi&s;ed robberies upon them. Their hand has been again&s;t every man, and of cour&s;e, every man's hand has been again&s;t them, but none have been able to conquer them. They have lived in the mid&s;t of all their brethren. In the earlier periods of their hi&s;tory, the de&s;cendants of Abraham by Ke|turah, and the po&s;terity of I&s;aac bordered upon them. To whatever power the&s;e neigh|bours, or others, ro&s;e, they retained their dominion; and were not driven from any part of their territories.
<Q>They have from fir&s;t to la&s;t maintained their independency, and notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t powerful efforts for their de&s;truction, &s;till dwell in the pre&s;ence of all their brethren, and in the pre&s;ence of all their enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton on the Prophecies, in two Volumes, 9th E|dition, p. 25, 26. Vol. 1.</NOTE></Q></P>

WHO but the omni&s;cient God could have fore&s;een the &s;tate of the de&s;cendants of I&s;h|mael? Is not the fulfilment of the predic|tions concerning them a &s;triking proof in &s;upport of the divine original of the &s;crip|tures?</P>
<P>THE prophecies re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the Jews, which have been fulfilled in the latter ages, and are now fulfilling, are too remark|able to be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence, when attend|ing to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The di&s;per&s;ion and the wretchedne&s;s of that people were foretold by Mo&s;es. The cur&s;es which &s;hould fall upon them for their di&s;obedience, are particularly and largely denounced in Deut. xxviii. I &s;hall &s;elect a few pa&s;&s;ages only; ver. 37. <HI>And thou &s;halt become an a&s;toni&s;hment, a proverb, and a by-word, among all nations whither the Lord thy God &s;hall lead thee.</HI> Ver&s;es 64, 65, 66. <HI>And the Lord &s;hall &s;catter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth unto the other; and there thou &s;halt &s;erve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and &s;tone. And among the&s;e nations &s;halt thou find no ea&s;e, neither &s;hall the &s;ole of thy foot have re&s;t; but the Lord will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and &s;orrow of mind: And thy life &s;hall hang in doubt before thee; and thou &s;halt fear day
<PB N="140" REF="031762_0135_0FEE3F11D913B168">and night, and &s;halt have none a&s;&s;urance of thy life.</HI> The&s;e predictions were in a degree ful|filled by the captivity of the kingdoms of I&s;rael and Judah, by the A&s;&s;yrians and Chal|deans; but have received a fuller accom|pli&s;hment in the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by the Romans, and in the pre&s;ent di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews. The&s;e la&s;t events were fore|told by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in Luke xxi. 24. <HI>And they &s;hall fall by the edge of the &s;word, and &s;hall be led away captive into all nations: and Je|ru&s;alem &s;hall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews were &s;laughtered in immen&s;e numbers, when their city was taken by Ti|tus the Roman general. A va&s;t multitude has peri&s;hed &s;ince, by ma&s;&s;acres and per&s;e|cutions. The Jews have not been permit|ted to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land of Canaan or Pale&s;|tine, for more than 1700 years; and they are &s;cattered through A&s;ia, and through mo&s;t of the countries of Europe and Africa; they are found on the American continent, and its adjacent i&s;lands. Their land has pa&s;&s;ed from one &s;et of conquerors to anoth|er, and is now in the hands of the Turks; and remains in a low and wretched &s;tate. The Jews &s;ince their la&s;t di&s;per&s;ion have, for the mo&s;t part, found no re&s;t; but the
<PB N="141" REF="031762_0136_0FEE3F1397112E90">Lord has given them <HI>a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and &s;orrow of mind.</HI> They have not enjoyed the rights of other citi|zens in the places where they have lived, they have been bani&s;hed from many king|doms; and in not a few in&s;tances, govern|ment has laid its hand on the property of that unhappy people, in a way of fine and confi&s;cation. They have been dete&s;ted by the nations, and have been <HI>a by-word</HI> among them. However criminal the Jews may have been, the benevolent heart is pained by even a &s;ummary recital of their &s;ufferings, and is rejoiced at the milder treatment they have met with of late. We hope that the period is at hand when their calamities will cea&s;e, by the univer&s;ally opening a door for their enjoyment of freedom, as is done by the &s;pirit of the civil con&s;titution of the U|nited States of America; and above all by their union with the Gentiles throughout the world under the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that the Jews, tho' they have met with &s;uch hard&s;hips and cruelties, yet remain a di&s;tinct people. This is the Lord's doing; and verifies what was &s;poken long ago by the prophets. I &s;hall only mention in this place a pa&s;&s;age recorded in Jerem. xxx. 11. addre&s;&s;ed to I&s;rael, <HI>For I
<PB N="142" REF="031762_0137_0FEE30E47915A1D8">am with thee, &s;aith the Lord, to &s;ave thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have &s;cattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in mea&s;ure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuni&s;hed.</HI> The Jews have not, like other nations, been &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t in conque&s;ts, by in|termingling with their conquerors, or with tho&s;e among whom they have lived. Tho' they have had the &s;tronge&s;t inducements to intermarry, and to blend in all re&s;pects, with the Gentiles, they, as a body, remain as widely &s;eparated from them by blood and religion as ever. However, they have, in &s;ome in&s;tances, externally complied with the idolatrous rites of the Romi&s;h church, to avoid the cruelties of the court of inqui&s;i|tion, they have at the &s;ame time adhered to the faith of their ance&s;tors; and when they have e&s;caped from the danger of the rack, they have renounced chri&s;tianity in every form, and openly returned to their religion. They remain to this day a &s;triking proof that the author of the prophecies re&s;pecting them is divine; and con&s;equently that the &s;criptures are given by in&s;piration of God.</P>
<P>WOULD our limits permit, we might point to the fulfilment of many prophecies, which were delivered long before the events
<PB N="143" REF="031762_0138_0FEE3F15334267F0">they predict were brought into exi&s;tence. Babylon now lies in ruins, "a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the bittern, and pools of water." Tyre, once "a mart of nations," is made "like the top of a rock; a place for the &s;pread|ing of nets in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea." We behold the man of &s;in, who&s;e ri&s;e was pre|dicted in the prophecies of the Old and New Te&s;tament, "&s;itting in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God; who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and &s;igns, and lying won|ders." And, to name no more, we behold now fulfilling the prophecy recorded in Rev|elation xvii. 16. "And the ten horns which thou &s;awe&s;t upon the bea&s;t, the&s;e &s;hall hate the whore, and &s;hall make her de&s;olate, and naked, and &s;hall eat her fle&s;h, and burn her with fire." The European kingdom which lead the way in giving temporal do|minion to the bea&s;t revived under the anti-chri&s;tian tyranny, is now &s;eizing on the wealth and de&s;troying the influence which &s;he once gloried in giving to the Roman Pontiff. We are furni&s;hed with abundant proof, that the pens of the prophets were guided by Him who, from eternity, beholds all the events of time. The nearer we ap|proach to the end of the world, the evidence in &s;upport of the in&s;piration of the Bible
<PB N="144" REF="031762_0139_0FEE2F656609ABC0">from the fulfilment of the prophecies, be|comes more and more clear and convincing. Whatever abu&s;es are made of the increa&s;ing light by the wicked, "the wi&s;e &s;hall under|&s;tand."</P>
<P>MY de&s;igned brevity on the copious &s;ub|ject of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, forbids me to add to the foregoing arguments. I &s;hall, after no|ticing a few popular objections, conclude with a practical improvement.</P>
<P>SOME have attempted to countenance their di&s;like of the &s;criptures, by &s;aying, that the language adopted in &s;ome parts of tho&s;e wri|tings, particularly in certain pa&s;&s;ages in the Old Te&s;tament, puts mode&s;ty to the blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of much information will not be perplexed with this difficulty. It will at once occur to them, that when God &s;peaks to any part of the human race, he mu&s;t ad|dre&s;s them in a language which they under|&s;tand, or the de&s;ign of revelation will be lo&s;t. It mu&s;t follow of cour&s;e, that the language of the age and the place when and where the revelation is made, mu&s;t be adopted. The meaning of particular words is con|&s;tantly altering by u&s;age. The word <HI>knave,</HI> for in&s;tance, in our language, was hereto|fore under&s;tood to mean a <HI>diligent &s;ervant;</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="031762_0140_0FEE30D92634DE58">but cu&s;tom now appropriates it to one who is guilty of <HI>fraud</HI> in his dealings with man|kind. Cu&s;tom is as much the &s;tandard of decency in the clothing of our thoughts, as in the clothing of our bodies. Some of the words and phra&s;es in our tran&s;lation of the Bible, which may appear indelicate when compared with modern &s;tyle, did not offend again&s;t delicacy two hundred years ago; and they may not two hundred years hence, or in a much &s;horter term. Among a civi|lized people it is as ea&s;y to di&s;cern a rotation in words and phra&s;es, as in any thing el&s;e that is equally under human control. It would be very &s;trange indeed, if the origi|nal language of the pentateuch, which was committed to writing more than three thou|&s;and years ago, perfectly &s;uited the various ta&s;tes which have prevailed in &s;tyle, from the days ot Mo&s;es to our time. It is to be remarked that the books which he wrote have pa&s;&s;ed through very different &s;tates of &s;ociety, in the lap&s;e of &s;o many ages; to each of which it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be compleatly conformed: Yet the manner in which tho&s;e books were written will abide the te&s;t of &s;ound critici&s;m at the pre&s;ent era of high literary improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="031762_0141_0FEE30E9506FA440">
LET us admit, for a moment, that the whole phra&s;eology and manner of writing in the mo&s;t ancient parts of the Jewi&s;h &s;crip|tures, perfectly corre&s;ponded with modern ta&s;te&mdash;I &s;ay, let us make this &s;uppo&s;ition, in order to learn whether that part of the Bi|ble which is accu&s;ed of indelicacy, would be as defen&s;ible as it now is. We may di&s;cern at once the effect of the &s;uppo&s;ed change. The men who cavil now, would immediately tack about, and exclaim again&s;t the penta|teuch as a forgery, from its &s;tyle. Hence, we &s;ee that the antiquity of the &s;tyle u&s;ed in the Mo&s;aic writings, as well as in other parts of &s;cripture, is a matter of importance in the controver&s;y with infidels. It was as proper that the &s;acred penmen &s;hould adopt the language and manner of writing pecu|liar to their own times, as that in alluding to mountains in their di&s;cour&s;es to the Jews, they &s;hould name <HI>Horeb, Carmel, or Hermon,</HI> rather than the <HI>Allegany,</HI> or the <HI>Andes.</HI> Af|ter what has been &s;aid on the change of the meaning of words and the &s;tate of &s;ociety, it is evident that no one has any ju&s;t cau&s;e to impeach the language of the &s;criptures of offences again&s;t mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE di&s;putes about what the religion of the Bible is, among tho&s;e who profe&s;s to
<PB N="147" REF="031762_0142_0FEE30DED38B5F48">adopt it, have been urged by &s;ome as an objection again&s;t its divine original. To this it may be an&s;wered,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT the enemies of divine revela|tion are not agreed among them&s;elves. Some infidels profe&s;s to believe that God is a good being; others deny that any &s;uch conclu&s;ion can be formed. Some of them con&s;ider the &s;oul of man as immortal; whil&s;t others &s;uppo&s;e that it dies with the body. If the di&s;putes among chri&s;tians overthrow chri&s;tianity, the di&s;putes among dei&s;ts overthrow dei&s;m. The objection weighs nothing on either &s;ide, and is wholly impertinent.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A CONSIDERABLE number of the controver&s;ies among chri&s;tians do not re|&s;pect the e&s;&s;entials of their religion; but are to be accounted for from the manner in which they are educated, the religious treat|i&s;es they read, the per&s;ons with whom they a&s;&s;ociate in the early periods of &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s, and &s;imilar cau&s;es. Differ|ences of this kind do not prove that the Bi|ble inculcates oppo&s;ite principles; for it is admitted that they do not materially affect what is nece&s;&s;ary to fit men for everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="148" REF="031762_0143_0FEE3F1ED87DFD30">
3dly. IT is granted that opinions have been maintained by &s;ome who profe&s;s to be|lieve in the in&s;piration of the &s;criptures, which &s;trike at their fundamental truths. But the ri&s;e of damnable here&s;ies is &s;o far from overthrowing the Bible, that it con|firms it; for that book contains many pre|dictions that &s;uch errors will appear; e&s;|pecially in the la&s;t days.</P>
<P>VIOLENT prejudices have been conceived again&s;t the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from the bad things which have been done under the cloak of it. To remove this &s;tumbling block, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT if the bad things which have been done by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves chri&s;|tians, go to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the go&s;pel, dei&s;m mu&s;t be overthrown according to the &s;ame plan of rea&s;oning. I pre&s;ume that no one who is the mo&s;t warmly engaged in &s;upport of infidelity, will affirm that all dei&s;ts have &s;hown high reverence to the Deity in their behaviour, or that they have all been men of &s;obriety, ju&s;tice, mercy and truth. We have to acknowledge with grief, that many abominable things have been done by per|&s;ons who have called them&s;elves the di&s;ci|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but if we mu&s;t give up our religion on account of their conduct,
<PB N="149" REF="031762_0144_0FEE3F206F2AD828">the dei&s;ts mu&s;t give up theirs on account of the impious and debauched morals of &s;ome of their order.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THERE is nothing in the nature of revealed religion which tends to the corrup|tion of morals; but every thing in it tends to make bad men better. The moral law requires holine&s;s, and forbids every &s;in. The go&s;pel breathes the &s;ame &s;pirit. It prom|i&s;es pardon and happine&s;s only to the pen|itent, and encourages with the hope of a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, patient continuance in well doing. The puni&s;hments threaten|ed to the wicked are &s;uited to alarm them, and to deter from the practice of iniquity. The religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has actually had the happie&s;t influence on tho&s;e who have cordially embraced it; as has appear|ed from their lives and deaths.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. WICKED men would not cloak their wickedne&s;s under the garb of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s there were &s;ome|thing in the go&s;pel which recommends it to the con&s;ciences of mankind. There could be no counterfeit coin, if there were no real coin. Men do not counterfeit iron or lead; but &s;ilver and gold, or &s;omething that rep|re&s;ents the value of the&s;e precious metals. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who commit iniquity under
<PB N="150" REF="031762_0145_0FEE3F2203008248">the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip to the go&s;pel, are &s;o far from proving it to be of no worth, that even they them&s;elves by implication, te&s;tify in its favor, though it is again&s;t their lu&s;ts.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. WE ought not to conclude again&s;t the worth of the chri&s;tian religion from its abu&s;es, on account of the ab&s;urdities which &s;uch an inference will draw after it. We mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, pronounce all the ble&s;&s;ings of common providence to be evils in them&s;elves; for they all have been, and &s;till are, &s;hamefully abu&s;ed. If we pronounce every thing bad, and to be avoided, which has been employed for a bad purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t con&s;ider as evil, food and raiment, the ground on which we tread, the &s;treams that water it, the produce of the garden and the field, the light which &s;trikes our eyes, and the air we breathe. We need not wonder that per&s;ons who di&s;|pute again&s;t the goodne&s;s of God, from the pains they bring upon them&s;elves by abu&s;ing it, wi&s;h to take refuge in annihilation, and indulge the forlorn hope that by &s;uicide they &s;hall ha&s;ten their return to the womb of nothing.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. IT will be acknowledged by every candid ob&s;erver, that the religion of the go&s;|pel promotes &s;ocial happine&s;s in every circle
<PB N="151" REF="031762_0146_0FEE3F2DEFB17CE8">in which it reigns. It prevents the wretch|edne&s;s which flows from riot and debauche|ry, &s;uppre&s;&s;es the malignant pa&s;&s;ions, and diffu&s;es the calm and pure plea&s;ures of tem|perance, diligence, contentment, and friend|&s;hip. Whatever per&s;ecutions have been en|dured for righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake, it is too plain to be denied, that the practice of chri&s;tianity gives a happine&s;s to individuals and to col|lective bodies, to which tho&s;e are &s;trangers who treat it with contempt. It has more|over been abundantly demon&s;trated by able writers, that where it is externally regarded by the inhabitants of a country in general, their morals are not &s;o loo&s;e as are tho&s;e of nations devoted to pagan idolatry.</P>
<P>IT is hoped that the ob&s;ervations which have been made, will be thought &s;ufficient to wipe away the reproach which has been ca&s;t upon the chri&s;tian religion, from the bad things that have been done by its hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THOSE who reject the divine authority of the Bible, have endeavoured to ju&s;tify their unbelief, by pleading, that they cannot be under obligations to conform their faith and practice to a book, which contains my&s;teries above the comprehen&s;ion of the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="031762_0147_0FEE3F2F88694260">
IF the objections of this kind are ju&s;t, it will follow that we are not bound to believe any thing which we cannot comprehend. But is there a man on the earth, "in his right mind," who will avow this con&s;e|quence? We are unable to comprehend the works of nature with which we are &s;ur|rounded. We know not how water is con|gealed into the hardne&s;s of &s;tone; nor can we comprehend the growth of even a &s;ingle blade of gra&s;s. Man is a my&s;tery to him|&s;elf. He cannot tell why certain kinds of food nouri&s;h his body rather than others; nor how his limbs are put in motion by the volitions of his &s;oul. If we are not bound to give our a&s;&s;ent to any thing which we cannot under&s;tand in all its parts, we mu&s;t deny facts which are daily taking place be|fore our eyes, yea more, we mu&s;t deny our own exi&s;tence. The objection we are now con&s;idering will go to athei&s;m; for no creature can fathom ab&s;olute eterni|ty. If there be a God he never had a be|ginning. When the human mind contem|plates this &s;ubject it is &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t. "Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"</P>
<P>IN the &s;upernatural revelation God hath
<PB N="153" REF="031762_0148_0FEE3F312EFDA9C0">made of his will, he &s;peaks like him&s;elf&mdash;a Being infinitely great. Were all the my&s;|teries which are delivered in the &s;acred vol|ume, perfectly on a level with our limited minds lately called into exi&s;tence, the gov|ernment of the moral world would be pla|ced in a lower grade than the kingdom of nature, and we &s;hould not have the &s;ame evidence as we now have that the finger of God is imprinted on the &s;criptures. But tho' &s;ome of the doctrines of the Bible are &s;o high that we can know but little concern|ing them in this dark probationary &s;tate, they can be &s;ufficiently apprehended even by babes in under&s;tanding to obtain eternal life. Be&s;ides, the truths which are mo&s;t my&s;terious are &s;o interwoven with tho&s;e which are plain, that if we reject the for|mer, we mu&s;t reject the latter. The various parts of this remarkable book form one har|monious &s;y&s;tem of faith and practice.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t objection that I &s;hall notice is taken from the &s;mall extent within which the writings of the Old and New Te&s;tament have been known. Since the &s;criptures ex|hibit an exclu&s;ive claim of guiding the human race in the way of truth and happine&s;s, it is contended, that their partial &s;pread is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the character of Him who is
<PB N="154" REF="031762_0149_0FEE3F3AA6174050">the Father of all mankind, and is no re&s;|pecter of per&s;ons; and that therefore they cannot be given by in&s;piration of God. To obviate this objection, let the following things be con&s;idered,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. GOD in his common providence di&s;|tributes his gifts, both of body and mind, ve|ry variou&s;ly; as daily experience teaches. It will not be pretended that men have ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain of him, becau&s;e he be|&s;tows upon &s;ome a more vigorous animal frame, or a higher degree of intellect, than upon others. No rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the means of moral and religious im|provement may not be as greatly diver&s;ified, by the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, as other ble&s;&s;ings are. Be&s;ides, the obligation deri|ved from privileges, is proportioned to their nature and degree. Mankind are not pun|i&s;hed for di&s;regarding truths of which they could have no knowledge; but for re&s;i&s;ting the light that has &s;hone before them.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. SINCE the whole human race have forfeited every favor from the hand of God, by &s;in, he may ju&s;tly exclude them all from happine&s;s, and con&s;equently may deny them opportunity of becoming acquainted with tho&s;e writings which contain the words of eternal life. All the favors enjoyed by
<PB N="155" REF="031762_0150_0FEE3F3C48333288">apo&s;tate creatures, flow from divine &s;ove|reign mercy; which excludes every idea of claim on their part. Tho&s;e, therefore, who are left in heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, experience no inju&s;tice. Their demerit is not le&s;&s;ened, nor is their &s;tate rendered any more deplor|able, by rea&s;on of God's conduct in giving the &s;criptures to others. If any refu&s;e to receive them becau&s;e they are not known throughout the world, they di&s;cover great ingratitude, and perver&s;ene&s;s. God has conferred upon us, the inhabitants of the United States of America, a larger portion of freedom than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t nations. Shall we murmur, and throw away our liber|ties, becau&s;e providence has not cau&s;ed all our fellow-men to enjoy the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings? Who hath licen&s;ed a worm of the du&s;t to dictate to the &s;overeign Ruler of heaven and earth! Or to &s;ay unto him, "What doe&s;t thou!"</P>
<P N="3">3dly. IT is owing to the criminal indif|ference of mankind to the &s;criptures, that the knowledge of them is confined within &s;uch narrow limits. Had, for in&s;tance, the &s;everal families of the &s;ons of Noah, in their di&s;per&s;ions from the plain in the land of Shinar, been friends to the truths which had at that time been revealed, they would
<PB N="156" REF="031762_0151_0FEE3F3DDE9B3868">have faithfully pre&s;erved them, and made high exertions to tran&s;mit them to their po&s;|terity. Had the word of the Lord been &s;weet unto their ta&s;te, they would have been much more de&s;irous of handing it down to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, than they were their knowl|edge of the arts. A like pious zeal pa&s;&s;ing from one generation to another, would have prevented the ignorance of divine reve|lation which &s;oon prevailed. By the time of Abraham there was a general departure to idolatry. That renowned patriarch &s;o|journed in many places, after he left Ur of the Chaldees in obedience to the command of God; for the &s;etting up his wor&s;hip in a pure form. But the people among whom he re&s;ided, in Canaan, in Egypt, and in other countries, did not improve the oppor|tunity of learning from him the truths and laws which he had immediately communi|cated to him from God, or had been tran&s;|mitted to him through the preceding in&s;pir|ed men. The Egyptians paid no la&s;ting at|tention to the mighty works wrought among them by the arm of Jehovah, in the days of Mo&s;es; nor did they regard the means of in&s;truction in the knowledge of the revealed will of God, to which they might have had acce&s;s. When the I&s;raelites were &s;ettled in Canaan, they were placed in the central &s;pot
<PB N="157" REF="031762_0152_0FEE3F3F9819A5B0">of the then known world. On different &s;ide: of them lay Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Chaldea, and A&s;&s;yria; out of which nations aro&s;e the fir&s;t empires of note among mankind. Un|der tho&s;e monarchies the arts and &s;ciences were fir&s;t cultivated, and from them have been &s;pread among the inhabitants of the we&s;tern regions. The land given to the children of I&s;rael is wa&s;hed on one &s;ide by the Mediterranean &s;ea, and bordered on the once famous cities of Tyre and Sidon; which extended their commerce to di&s;tant countries. To the nations of the ea&s;t the cho&s;en people were well known, whil&s;t they dwelt in Canaan. By their captivity under the A&s;&s;yrians and Chaldeans, the &s;acred books were carried into many parts of A&s;ia; where they were kept by the di&s;per&s;ed Jews until the day when the Me&s;&s;iah appeared. In the ages which followed the return of &s;ome of the captives to Jeru&s;alem under Cyrus, and the rebuilding of their city and temple, the Jews became well known to the Greeks and the Romans. The Apo&s;tles in their time carried the go&s;pel far beyond the bounds of Judea, and preached the word of eternal life among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>IF there had been a general love of divine truth among the human race, the &s;criptures
<PB N="158" REF="031762_0153_0FEE3F4BE8135A88">would have been di&s;&s;eminated far and wide on this inhabited globe. From the inatten|tion to the in&s;pired writings which has ap|peared in the conduct of mankind, it is man|ife&s;t that they have not cho&s;en to retain God in their knowledge. In&s;tead of charging him with an unju&s;t partiality, let them con|fe&s;s that &s;in is the cau&s;e of the exten&s;ive reign of heathen darkne&s;s. It is wholly ow|ing to the mere &s;overeign mercy of God, that the knowledge of divine revelation has not peri&s;hed from the earth.</P>
<P>HAVING taken a brief view of &s;ome of the principal arguments in &s;upport of the truth and in&s;piration of the Bible, and at|tempted to obviate &s;everal objections, I pro|ceed to improve the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may reflect on the unrea&s;onable and dangerous conduct of tho&s;e who are en|deavoring to undermine, and de&s;troy the influence of revealed religion; by repre&s;en|ting it as the work of vi&s;ionary or intere&s;ted men. Many of the dei&s;ts have never given them&s;elves the trouble of examining into the evidences of the truth and in&s;piration of the &s;criptures; but having picked up here and there &s;omething which they di&s;like in them, either by de&s;ultory reading, or from pro|mi&s;cuous company, they proceed to a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="159" REF="031762_0154_0FEE3F4D820578A8">with great confidence, that tho&s;e writings are the work of a mercenary prie&s;thood, or de&s;igning politicians. Such treatment of a book which claims a divine origin, not only announces the badne&s;s of their hearts who thus ha&s;tily reject it, but does no honor to their under&s;tandings. Among the few in|fidels who have gone into elaborate di&s;qui&s;i|tions concerning the authority of the &s;crip|tures, methods have been adopted, by men of genius and &s;cience, to overthrow tho&s;e writings, which carry in them the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities. If the &s;ame kind of rea&s;oning were employed on any other &s;ubject, they them&s;elves would look upon it with con|tempt. For the &s;ake of evading the evi|dence from miracles, dei&s;ts have labored to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch rules, for determining the ex|i&s;tence of facts of which we have not been per&s;onal witne&s;&s;es, as would de&s;troy our faith in all hi&s;tory. They have fallen into errors of the mo&s;t palpable kind, in their attempts to prove that the Bible is at vari|ance with it&s;elf. As, for in&s;tance, when the different writers of any part of its hi&s;tory, do not &s;ay preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, or one of them mentions facts omitted by another, infidels reject the whole as the contradictory accounts of lying impo&s;ters. At the &s;ame time they will give full credit to many au|thors
<PB N="160" REF="031762_0155_0FEE3F4F2616EE48">of civil hi&s;tory, who, in narrating the &s;ame general events, mention different cir|cum&s;tances from each other, and will &s;peak of &s;uch hi&s;torians with applau&s;e. Dei&s;ts will grant that God may de&s;troy countries by the pe&s;tilence, famine, or earthquakes; but if he employ men as the in&s;truments of his wrath, as he did in cutting off the inhab|itants of Canaan, they cry out, <HI>cruelty! hor|rid</HI> cruelty! They overlook the proof of the in&s;piration of the &s;criptures, which is fur|ni&s;hed by miracles of the mo&s;t &s;triking kind. They &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light that &s;hines with meridian brightne&s;s, in the ful|filment of the prophecies. They withhold no exertions, in their power, to heap re|proach upon that pure and benevolent reli|gion, which corre&s;ponds with the divine character, opens a door of hope to the guilty, and conducts the humble and the penitent to a world of everla&s;ting joy. The open enemies of the go&s;pel, &s;trive to bring in|to univer&s;al contempt the only religion that can reconcile mankind to God, and unite them in permanent love to one another. Infidels them&s;elves are very much indebted, for their &s;peculative knowledge of the Deity and moral virtue, to the Bible. By rejec|ting it they di&s;cover their ingratitude, and &s;hort &s;ightedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="031762_0156_0FEE3F50CB5B2290">
WHAT advantages do dei&s;ts expect to de|rive from trampling under foot the holy &s;criptures? They have nothing to put in the place of the doctrines which they explode, that can yield them &s;olid enjoyment in their gaye&s;t &s;ea&s;ons. What con&s;olation can their principles afford, when carried into practice, in days of trouble, or in the hour of &s;erious reflection? Their philo&s;ophy cannot allevi|ate their pains; by a&s;&s;uring them of a future &s;tate, or by pointing out the road which leads to &s;ub&s;tantial interminable happine&s;s. But do they wi&s;h to rid them&s;elves of the belief of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments? and hope to die like the brutes? Wonder|ful &s;agacity! What! do the honor and hap|pine&s;s of man &s;tand on a level with the hon|or and happine&s;s of the bea&s;ts of the field!</P>
<P>WHAT benefit will &s;ociety derive from the &s;pread of dei&s;tical principles? Have they ever when fully imbibed, reformed a &s;ingle vicious per&s;on? Experience demon&s;trates that in proportion as they prevail among a people, they weaken reverence towards the name of God, and are accompanied with loo&s;e morals. Such are the unhappy effects which infidelity produces: nor can they be denied on account of the regular lives of a

Civil laws will be found feeble re&s;traints on communities, when the re&s;traints of reveal|ed religion are de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THOSE who make a direct attack on the &s;acred volume are highly criminal. Noth|ing can ju&s;tify them in acting again&s;t the light that is held up before them, in the word and works of God. None are required to believe the &s;criptures without &s;ufficient evi|dence to &s;atisfy the rational mind; but &s;ince they are abundantly &s;upported by the &s;cheme of religion they contain, as well as by ex|ternal te&s;timonies, none can deny their di|vine original without incurring infinite guilt. The difficulties that have been &s;tarted rela|tive to their hi&s;tory, their faith and morals, may be removed to the &s;atisfaction of the candid. It is impious in creatures to &s;ug|ge&s;t that a better manife&s;tation of truth might have been made than is exhibited in them. There is a depth in God's wi&s;dom and knowledge which we cannot fathom. He only knows how to di&s;play his perfec|tions before finite intelligencies in the be&s;t manner to glorify his holy name, and what are the mo&s;t &s;uitable means to bring &s;inners
<PB N="163" REF="031762_0158_0FEE3F601358BA70">to repentance. A cavilling temper is never &s;atisfied. If any will not hear Mo&s;es and the Prophets, Chri&s;t, and the Apo&s;tles, neither would they be per&s;uaded tho' one ro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>WHAT confu&s;ion would fill the mind of a dei&s;t, &s;hould one of his converts addre&s;s him in the moment of remor&s;e, <Q>You, Sir, fir&s;t taught me to laugh at religion&mdash;then to doubt its truth&mdash;and then to trample it under foot. I followed you next into vice&mdash;I threw off re&s;traint&mdash;I have not feared God, nor have I regarded man. I tremble to think of my end: For tho' I &s;till wi&s;h to di&s;believe, my con&s;cience whi&s;pers&mdash;<HI>what if the go&s;pel I have denied &s;hould prove true at la&s;t!</HI></Q> How, O ye &s;ons of infidelity! who boa&s;t of making di&s;|ciples to your creed, and to every fa&s;hiona|ble vice&mdash;how can ye endure to meet the &s;ouls you have deluded and undone, at the bar of God! They will ri&s;e as &s;wift witne&s;|&s;es again&s;t you before him who will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s. Be entreated to read the &s;criptures with a candid, &s;erious temper, and impartially examine the argu|ments which e&s;tabli&s;h their truth and in&s;pi|ration. God grant that you may no longer
<PB N="164" REF="031762_0159_0FEE3F61A14A2010">remain enemies of the Go&s;pel; but that it may be rendered effectual to your &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN a review of the &s;ubject of the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, we are taught the duty of the friends of revealed religion, to labor for its defence, and to make it the guide of their lives.</P>
<P>WE declare with our lips our belief in the truth and in&s;piration of the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament, and that the enjoyment of them is a privilege of ine&s;ti|mable worth. We profe&s;s a high venera|tion for the&s;e writings; becau&s;e they con|tain a rich and inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure of di|vine knowledge, and becau&s;e they point out the only way to e&s;cape everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, and to obtain eternal life. We cannot te&s;|tify our gratitude for having the oracles of God committed unto us, if we do not &s;earch into their meaning with diligence, and li&s;ten to them with a humble and devout frame of mind. The man of real piety, delights in the law of the Lord, and in it doth he med|itate day and night. He crieth after knowl|edge, and lifteth up his voice for under&s;tan|ding; he &s;eeketh her as &s;ilver, and &s;earch|eth for her as for hidden trea&s;ures. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to find in &s;ome per&s;ons of mature age and good abilities, among the profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="165" REF="031762_0160_0FEE3F65E0C0BC30">friends of the Bible, but a &s;mall acquain|tance with its hi&s;tory or doctrines. In&s;tead of attending to the word of the Lord their minds are &s;wallowed up in worldly pur&s;uits, or are diverted from the &s;tudy of it, by books of wit and humour.</P>
<P>MANY of the difficulties which occur in the reading of the &s;criptures, will be removed by comparing one pa&s;&s;age with another, rel|ative to the &s;ame &s;ubject in different parts of tho&s;e writings. The doctrines which they contain that far &s;urpa&s;s our comprehen|&s;ion, cannot be eradicated without giving up the &s;acred volume into the hands of its a|vowed enemies, and placing it on the &s;ame ground with the works of a heathen Plato, or Seneca. Tho&s;e who humbly wait on God will be guided into all nece&s;&s;ary truths: "The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way." Be|lievers will be kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to expect from pre&s;ent appearances, and from the prophecies, that the church will meet with violent a&s;&s;aults from infidelity, between the period in which we live, and the time when "the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea." Now, when the en|emy
<PB N="166" REF="031762_0161_0FEE3F6E8220F3D0">is coming in like a flood, we are loudly called upon to lift up a &s;tandard again&s;t him. The performance of this duty, requires our attention to the arguments which demon|&s;trate the &s;criptures to be true, and from God; and our earne&s;t endeavours to main|tain the faith which was once delivered unto the &s;aints. Chri&s;tian teachers are under a peculiar and &s;olemn charge, to continue in the things which they have learned of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and to labor to impre&s;s the belief on the minds of others, that <HI>all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truc|tion in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Above all, let every friend of revealed religion imbibe its &s;pirit, and obey its laws. If we love the word of the Lord, we &s;hall place a high value on the &s;abbath, and on all divine in&s;titutions: And &s;hall bear te&s;timony again&s;t the various cour|&s;es which di&s;honor God, and tend to de&s;troy mankind. Let parents teach their children the doctrines and duties of chri&s;tianity, and enforce their in&s;tructions by a holy example.</P>
<P>DOTH the go&s;pel point out immortality to man, let this &s;olemnize our minds, and in|cite us to give diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure. Nothing can counter-balance the lo&s;s of the &s;oul. What are all
<PB N="167" REF="031762_0162_0FEE2F5F0E6618A0">the plea&s;ures, the riches, and the honors of the world, when compared with "an inher|itance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away!" Let us remember that the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, "teacheth us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, right|eou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world; looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glo|rious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>

<P>YOU are coming into active life in a day very different, in &s;everal re&s;pects, from any former period. The late revolution in our country has extended its influence far and wide; and appears de&s;igned by providence to draw after it a train of con&s;equences, who&s;e importance ri&s;es to a height that baffles the calculations of the human mind. We are bound to give thanks to God for the rare privilege we enjoy of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing ev|ery &s;ubject as publicly as we plea&s;e, and of expre&s;&s;ing our &s;entiments without re&s;traint.

Popery and &s;uper&s;tition have received a deep wound; at the &s;ame time infidelity lifts up its head, and open vices make &s;wift and alarming pro|gre&s;s. The heart of man is the &s;ame now as it ever has been &s;ince the apo&s;tacy; but it &s;hows it&s;elf in a different form from what it has u&s;ually done among chri&s;tian nations, and calls in principles to ju&s;tify its criminal indulgencies with more confidence than had before been &s;een. Many in our day give out that the age of rea&s;on is come, and that mankind may now determine for them&s;elves what is virtue and what is vice, without any regard to the &s;criptures. They &s;eem to think them&s;elves at full liberty, in the &s;ight of God, to reject any revelation he may make, without incurrring his di&s;plea&s;ure. If our choice be the only rule of conduct that is binding upon us, we are placed in a lawle&s;s univer&s;e, and are not accountable to God.</P>
<P>PAUSE a moment&mdash;and reflect on the evil and danger of being led a&s;tray by opinions which flatter the pride of the heart, and are an inlet to every vice. If you regard your own peace and &s;afety, you will not li&s;ten to men who &s;et their mouth again&s;t the heavens, and advocate the cau&s;e of licentiou&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="169" REF="031762_0164_0FEE3F734A9434C8">Look on the effects of infidelity upon tho&s;e who are &s;coffing at the Bible, and are &s;triv|ing to influence others to treat it with con|tempt. Do they appear to have the fear of God before their eyes? Can you believe that their real aim is to promote your true happine&s;s? A &s;en&s;e of propriety, mu&s;t ren|der a &s;et of low characters di&s;gu&s;ting to you, who belch out their hatred of religion in the noi&s;y clubs, where &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s is bani&s;hed, and where ardent &s;pirits animate the blu&s;tering hero of the night. Pity the poor creature who cur&s;es the book which forewarns him of his awful fate, and com|mands him to lead a life of temperance and &s;obriety. From per&s;ons of a different de|&s;cription you are in much greater danger of being pro&s;elyted to infidelity. You may in your intercour&s;e with mankind, meet with dei&s;ts who&s;e talents are re&s;pectable, and who&s;e addre&s;s is engaging. The&s;e will con|&s;ult your feelings, and will not &s;hock you with a &s;udden propo&s;al of renouncing the chri&s;tian faith; but will &s;ugge&s;t doubts re|lative to its hi&s;torical truth, or the fitne&s;s of its doctrines, or the ju&s;tice of its precepts.</P>
<P>IT is not to be expected that tho&s;e who have been trained up, from their childhood,
<PB N="170" REF="031762_0165_0FEE3F7CB3F60850">in the belief of the &s;criptures, will renounce them at once, and in&s;tantly take a leap into the aby&s;s of dei&s;m. Per&s;ons who make this dreadful plunge, u&s;ually advance towards it from &s;mall beginnings. You will progre&s;s towards the gulph which has &s;wallowed up the avowed enemies of the Bible, if you are in any degree entangled with what goes un|der the name of <HI>Modern Liberality;</HI> which affirms, that it is a matter of perfect indiffer|ence what &s;entiments any adopt for their re|ligious creed. It is not pretended by chri&s;|tians, that a mere a&s;&s;ent to revealed doctrines forms a good character; but they cannot be &s;o ab&s;urd as to allow that all opinions are alike friendly to virtue. Is it as probable that the man who believes in annihilation at death, will refrain from perjury, as he who believes that he &s;hall exi&s;t in another world, and that there God will call him to an ac|count for his conduct in this? Have we the &s;ame rea&s;on to look for purity in him who wor&s;hips a &s;tock or a &s;tone, as in him who wor&s;hips Jehovah? Infidels make high pro|fe&s;&s;ions of liberality, as above defined: But if they &s;peak their real &s;entiments, why do they make exertions to de&s;troy the faith of others in the Bible? What cau&s;e can they a&s;&s;ign for their zeal in pro&s;elyting, if they e&s;|teem
<PB N="171" REF="031762_0166_0FEE30ED9C2542E0">it to be perfectly indifferent what creed any one adopts?</P>
<P>WERE the Bible to peri&s;h from among us, there would be no means left, &s;ufficient to prevent paying divine honors to the de|parted &s;pirits of patriots and heroes, or even to the inanimate creation. The impious, ob&s;cene, and cruel rites of pagani&s;m would be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould chri&s;tianity cea&s;e to enlighten us; and our religious &s;tate would be the &s;ame with that of by far the large&s;t proportion of mankind now on the earth. Human &s;cience would not be found a &s;uffi|cient guard to defend us again&s;t &s;uch evils; for the learned Greeks and Romans were, at lea&s;t, as much given to idolatry, as the &s;avages that roam in the de&s;ert. The hi&s;tory of the whole heathen world from the days of Abraham until now, exhibits the &s;ame melancholy picture with Greece and Rome. A knowledge of the arts and &s;ciences is very u&s;eful; but cannot &s;tand in the place of di|vine revelation.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould plead that the mi&s;eries which have flown from corrupt rituals would be avoided by annihilating every form of re|ligion, they &s;uppo&s;e a fact which can never generally happen, &s;o long as hope and fear remain in the human brea&s;t. But if the e|vent
<PB N="172" REF="031762_0167_0FEE30F69B1C75D0">they contemplate could be realized, each individual would feel him&s;elf licen&s;ed to live according to nature, and a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s would en&s;ue, e&s;pecially in large communities, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any thing the world has hitherto &s;een. Neither prop|erty, nor cha&s;tity, nor life, would be pro|tected; and the earth would groan under the horrors of the infernal regions.</P>
<P>BEWARE, dear youth, of drinking in the poi&s;on of infidelity. Embrace the religion which came from above, and make it the guide of your lives. In this choice you will find light, peace, and joy, and will be &s;ecured from falling into fatal &s;nares. Jo&s;eph, in the bloom of youth and beauty, was pro|tected in a dangerous moment, by reverenc|ing the laws of Jehovah. He replied to the importunate &s;educer, <HI>How can I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> Impartially review the evidences of the truth and in&s;pi|ration of the Bible. If you read this holy book with diligence and meekne&s;s, you will be charmed with the pure and benevolent &s;pirit which it breathes; and will be fully per&s;uaded that no being but God can be its author. The miracles recorded in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New, and the fulfil|ment
<PB N="173" REF="031762_0168_0FEE3F7E4DC6D330">of the prophecies, give a divine &s;anc|tion to the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>TRIFLE not away the morning of life in vain amu&s;ements, or in hearkening to fa|bles. You are not creatures of a day; but are born for eternity. The pre&s;ent momen|tary &s;tate will be followed with con&s;equen|ces of infinite importance. Secure without delay the glorious immortality &s;et before you in the go&s;pel. From early life may you know the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make you wi&s;e unto &s;alvation through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: To Him be glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
