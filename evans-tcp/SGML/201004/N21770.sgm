<HEAD>THE SURPRISING LIEE AND DEATH OF Dr. <HI>John Fau&s;tus.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of his Parentage and Birth.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN FAUSTUS</HI> was born in the town of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> in the prov|ince of <HI>Weimer,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> his fa|ther a poor hu&s;bandman, and not able well to bring him up; yet having an uncle at <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> a rich man, and without i&s;&s;ue, he took this <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> from his father and made him his heir, in&s;omuch that his father was no more troubled with him; for he remained with his uncle at <HI>Witten|burg,</HI> where he was kept at the uni|ver&s;ity in the &s;ame city, to &s;tudy <HI>Di|vinity;</HI> but <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> being of a naugh|ty mind, and otherwi&s;e addicted, plied not his &s;tudies, but betook him|&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="028655_0004_0FDA3BACD602CBD0">to other exerci&s;es, which his un|cle hearing often, rebuked him for it; as <HI>Eli</HI> oftentimes rebuked his children for &s;inning again&s;t the Lord, even &s;o this good old man laboured to have <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> apply his &s;tudy to <HI>Divinity,</HI> that he might come to the knowledge of God and his law. But it is manife&s;t that many virtuous parents have wicked children, as <HI>Cain, Reuben, Ab&s;alom,</HI> and &s;uch like, have been to their parents. So <HI>Fau&s;|tus</HI> having godly parents, who &s;eeing him to be of a forward wit, were de|&s;irous to bring him up in virtuous &s;tudies, namely, of <HI>Divinity;</HI> but he gave him&s;elf &s;ecretly to <HI>Necro|mancy</HI> and <HI>Conjuration,</HI> in&s;omuch that few or none could perceive his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But to the purpo&s;e, <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> con|tinued at &s;tudy in the univer&s;ity, and was by the Rectors, and &s;ixteen ma&s;|ters afterwards, examined how he had profited in his &s;tudies; and be|ing found by them, that none of his time were able to argue with him in <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">nity,</HI> or for the excellency of his
<PB N="7" REF="028655_0005_0FDA3BDF34791B00">wi&s;dom, to compare with him, with one con&s;ent they made him <HI>Doctor of Divinity.</HI> But Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> with|in a &s;hort time after he had obtained his degree, fell into &s;uch fanta&s;ies, and deep cogitations, that he was mocked of many, and of mo&s;t part of the &s;tudents was called the <HI>Specula|tor;</HI> and &s;ometimes he would throw the &s;criptures from him, as though he had no care of his former profe&s;|&s;ion, &s;o that he began a mo&s;t ungod|ly life, as hereafter more at large may appear; for as the old <HI>proverb</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Who can hold what will away?</HI> So, who can hold <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> from the dev|il, that &s;eeks after him with all his endeavours; for he accompanied him&s;elf with divers that were &s;een in tho&s;e devili&s;h arts, and that had the <HI>Chaldean, Per&s;ian, Hebrew, Ara|bian</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> tongues, u&s;ing fig|ures, characters, conjurations, incan|tations, with many other ceremonies belonging to tho&s;e infernal arts, as <HI>Necromancy, Charms, Sooth&s;aying, Witchcraft, Enchantment,</HI> being de|lighted with their books, words and
<PB N="8" REF="028655_0006_0FDA3BAE5447FC70">names &s;o well, that he &s;tudied day and night therein, in&s;omuch that he could not abide to be called <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> but waxed a worldly man, and named him&s;elf an <HI>A&s;trologian,</HI> and a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> and for a &s;had|ow &s;ometimes a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and did great cures; namely, with <HI>herbs, roots, waters, drinks</HI> and <HI>cly&s;ters;</HI> and without doubt he was pa&s;&s;ing wi&s;e and excellent in holy &s;criptures: <HI>But be that knoweth his ma&s;ter's will, and doth it not, is worthy to be beaten with many &s;tripes.</HI> It is written. <HI>No man can &s;eve two ma&s;ters, and thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> But <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> threw all this in the wind, and made his &s;oul of no e&s;timation, regarding more the worldly plea&s;ures than the joys to come; therefore at the day of judgment there is no hope of his redemption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>How Dr.</HI> Fau&s;tus <HI>began to practi&s;e his Develi&s;h Art; and conjured the Devil, making him to appear, and meet him on the morrow morning at his own hou&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU have heard before, that all <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI>'s mind was to &s;tudy the arts of <HI>Necromancy</HI> and <HI>Conjuration;</HI> which exerci&s;e he followed day and night, and taking to him the wings of an eagle, thought to fly over the whole world, and to know the &s;ecrets of heaven and earth; for his &s;pecu|lation was &s;o wonderful, being ex|pert in u&s;ing his <HI>Vocabula,</HI> figures, character, conjuration and other cer|emonial actions, that in all ha&s;te he put practice to bring the Devil before him, and taking his way to a thick wood near <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> called in the <HI>German</HI> tongue <HI>Spi&s;&s;er holt,</HI> that is in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Spi&s;&s;er</HI>'s <HI>Wood,</HI> as <HI>Fau&s;|tus</HI> would oftentimes boa&s;t of it a|mong the crew, being in jollity, he came to the wood one evening into
<PB N="10" REF="028655_0008_0FDA3BB2F42526D0">the cro&s;s way, where he made with his wand a circle in the du&s;t, and within that many more circles and characters; and thus pa&s;t away the time till it was nine or ten of the clock at night; then began Dr. <HI>Fau&s;|tus</HI> to call on <HI>Mepho&s;tophiles</HI> the &s;pir|it, and to charge him in the name of <HI>Belzebub,</HI> to appear there pre&s;ently without any longer &s;tay; then pre&s;|ently the Devil began &s;o great a ru|mour in the in the wood, as if heav|en and earth would have come to|gether, and the trees with wind bow|ed their tops to the ground; then fell the Devil to roar, as if the whole wood had been full of Lions, and &s;uddenly about the circle run the Devil, as if a thou&s;and waggons had be running together on paved &s;tones: After this, at the four corners of the wood it thundered horribly, with &s;uch lightning, as if the whole world to his &s;eeming had been on fire. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> all this while, half amazed at the Devil's &s;o long tarrying, and doubting whether he were be&s;t to a|bide any more &s;uch horrible conjur|ings,
<PB N="11" REF="028655_0009_0FDA3BE40EBFF0A0">thought to leave his circle and depart; whereupon the Devil made him &s;uch mu&s;ick of all &s;orts, as if the Nymphs them&s;elves had been in the place: Whereat <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> revived, and &s;tood &s;toutly in his circle, expecting his purpo&s;e, and began again to con|jure the &s;pirit <HI>Mepho&s;tophiles,</HI> in the name of the Prince of Devils, to ap|pear in his likene&s;s; whereat &s;ud|denly, over his head hung hovering in the air, a mighty dragon; then calls <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> again after his devili&s;h manner, at which there was a mon|&s;trous cry in the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented &s;ouls cur&s;ing their condition. Pre&s;|ently not three fathom above his head, fell a flame in manner of light|ning, and changed it&s;elf into a globe; yet <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> feared it not, but did per|&s;uade him&s;elf that the Devil &s;hould give him his reque&s;t before he would leave. Oftentimes after to his com|panions he would boa&s;t that he had the &s;toute&s;t head under the cope of Heaven at command. Whereat they an&s;wered. <HI>They knew none &s;touter than the Pope or
<PB N="12" REF="028655_0010_0FDA3BB4A1817BF0">Emperor.</HI> But <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> &s;aid, <HI>The head that is my &s;ervant, is above all upon earth;</HI> and repeated certain words out of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> to make his argument good, <HI>The Prince of the World is upon Earth, and under Heav|en.</HI> Well, let us come again to his conjuration, where we left him at the fiery globe: <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> vexed at his &s;pirit's &s;o long tarrying, u&s;ed his charms with full purpo&s;e not to de|part before he had his intent, and crying on <HI>Mepho&s;tophiles</HI> the &s;pirit, &s;uddenly the globe opened, and &s;prung up in the height of a man, &s;o burning a time, in the end it con|verted to the &s;hape of a fiery man. This plea&s;ant bea&s;t ran about the cir|cle a great while; and la&s;tly, appear|ed in the manner of a Grey Fryar, a&s;king <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> what was his reque&s;t? <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> commanded that the next morning at twelve of the clock, he &s;hould appear to him at his hou&s;e; but the Devil would in no wi&s;e grant it. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> began to conjure him a|gain, in the name of <HI>Belzebub,</HI> that he &s;hould fulfil his reque&s;t; where|upon
<PB N="13" REF="028655_0011_0FDA3BE51D9ECB50">upon the &s;pirit agreed, and &s;o they departed each on his way.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The conference of Dr.</HI> Fau&s;tus <HI>with his Spirit</HI> Mepho&s;tophiles, <HI>the morning following, at his own hou&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> having commanded the &s;pirit to be with him, at the hour appointed, he came and ap|peared in his chamber, demanding of <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> what his de&s;ire was: Then began Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> anew with him, to conjure him, that he would be o|bedient unto him, and to an&s;wer him certain articles, to fulfill them in all points.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That the &s;pirit &s;hould &s;erve him, and be obedient unto him in all things that he a&s;ked of him, from that hour, until the hour of his death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Further, any thing that he de&s;ir|ed of him, he &s;hould bring him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Al&s;o, that in all</HI> Fau&s;tus's <HI>de|mands and interrogations, the &s;pirit &s;hould tell him nothing but what was true.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="028655_0012_0FDA3BB647C453B8">
Hereupon the &s;pirit an&s;wered, and laid his ca&s;e forth, <HI>That he had no &s;uch power of him&s;elf, until he had fir&s;t given his prince (that was ruler over him) to under&s;tand thereof, and to know if he could obtain &s;o much of his Lord: Therefore &s;peak farther, that I may do thy whole de&s;ire to my Prince; for it is not in my power to do it with|out his Leave.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> upon this, aro&s;e where he &s;at, and &s;aid, <HI>I will have my re|que&s;t, and yet I will not be damned.</HI> The &s;pirit an&s;wered. <HI>Then &s;halt thou want thy de&s;ire, and yet art thou mine notwith&s;tanding; if any man would detain thee, it is but in vain, for thy infidelity hath confounded thee.</HI> Here|upon &s;pake <HI>Fau&s;tus, Get thee hence from me, and take St.</HI> Valentine's <HI>Farewell, and</HI> Cri&s;man <HI>with thee: yet I conjure thee, that thou be here at evening, and bethink thy&s;elf of what I have a&s;ked thee, a&s;k thy Prince's council therein. Mepho&s;tophiles</HI> the &s;pirit thus an&s;wered, vani&s;hed away, leaving <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> in his &s;tudy, where

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The &s;econd time of the &s;pirit's appear|ing to</HI> Fau&s;tus <HI>at his hou&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FAUSTUS</HI> continued in his dev|ili&s;h cogitations, never moving out of the place where the &s;pirit left him, &s;uch was his fervent love to the Devil. The night approaching this &s;wift flying Spirit appeared to <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> offering him&s;elf with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his &s;ervice, with full authority from his Prince, to do what&s;oever he would reque&s;t; if <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> would promi&s;e to be his. This an&s;wer I bring thee, an an&s;wer mu&s;t thou make by me again; yet I
<PB N="16" REF="028655_0014_0FDA3BB75DE34A78">will hear what is thy de&s;ire, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;worn to me to be here at this time. Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> gave him this an&s;wer, though faintly for his foul's &s;ake. That his reque&s;t was none other, but to become a Devil, or at lea&s;t, a limb of him, and that the &s;pirit &s;hould agree to the&s;e arti|cles following:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That he might be a &s;pirit in &s;hape and quality.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That</HI> Mepho&s;tophiles <HI>&s;hould be his &s;ervant at his command.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That</HI> Mepho&s;tophiles <HI>&s;hould bring him any thing, and do for him what&s;oever he de&s;ired.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That at all times he &s;hould be in the hou&s;e invi&s;ible to all men, except only to him&s;elf, and at his command to &s;hew him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That</HI> Mepho&s;tophiles <HI>&s;hould at all times appear at his command, and in what form or &s;hape &s;oever he would.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e points the &s;pirit an|&s;wered Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus, That all this &s;hould be granted him, and
<PB N="17" REF="028655_0015_0FD9BB73D204CEE8">fulfilled, and more, if he would a|gree unto him upon certain ar|ticles, as followeth:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Dr.</HI> Fau&s;tus <HI>&s;hould give him&s;elf to his Lord</HI> Lucifer, <HI>body and &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For confirmation of the &s;ames he &s;hould make him a writing in his own blood.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That he would be an enemy to all chri&s;tian people.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That he would deny the chri&s;tian belief.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That he let not any man change his opinion, if any man &s;hould go a|bout to di&s;&s;aude or withdraw him from it.</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the &s;pirit promi&s;ed <HI>Fau&s;|tus</HI> to give him certain years to live in health and plea&s;ure, and when &s;uch years were expired, that then <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> would be fetched away; and if he would hold the&s;e articles and conditions, that then he &s;hould have what&s;oever his heart would wi&s;h or de&s;ire; and <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> &s;hould quickly perceive him&s;elf to be a &s;pirit in all
<PB N="18" REF="028655_0016_0FD9BB7FB750CFF8">manner of actions what&s;oever. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI>'s mind was &s;o enflamed, that he forgot his &s;oul, and promi&s;ed <HI>Nepho&s;tophiles</HI> to hold all things as he mentioned them; he thought the Devil was not &s;o black as they u&s;ed to paint him; nor Hell &s;o hot as the people &s;ay.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>The third parley between Dr. Fau|&s;tus and Mephoho&s;tophiles about a Conclu&s;ien.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> had made his promi&s;e to the Devil, in the morning betimes, he called his &s;pir|it before him, and commanded him, that he &s;hould always come to him like a Friar, after the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and with a bell in his hand, like St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> and to ring it once or twice before he appeared, that he might know of his certain coming: Then <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> demanded of his &s;pir|it, <HI>What is his name?</HI> The &s;pirit an|&s;wered, <HI>my name is as thou ha&s;t &s;aid,</HI>

<P>DR. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> &s;itting pen&s;ive hav|ing but only one boy with him, &s;uddenly there appeared his &s;pirit <HI>Mepho&s;tophiles,</HI> in likene&s;s of a very man, from whom i&s;&s;ued mo&s;t dreadful fiery flames, in&s;omuch that the boy was afraid; but being har|dened by his ma&s;ter, he bid him &s;tand &s;till, and he &s;hould have no haerm: The &s;pirit began to bleat, as in a &s;inging manner. This pretty &s;port plea&s;ed Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> well, but he would not call his &s;pirit into the counting hou&s;e, until he had &s;een more: Anon was heard a ru&s;hing of armed men, and trampling of hor&s;es: This cea&s;ing, came a kennel of hounds, and they cha&s;ed a great hart in the hall, and there the hart was &s;lain. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> took heart, came
<PB N="23" REF="028655_0021_0FDA3BEB183697D8">forth and looked upon the hart; but pre&s;ently before him there was a lion and a dragon together, fighting &s;o fiercely, that <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> thought they would have thrown down the hou&s;e; but the dragon overcame the lion, and &s;o they vani&s;hed. After this came a peacock and a peahen, the cock bru&s;tling of his tail, and turning to the female, beat her, and &s;o vani&s;hed. Afterwards followed a furious bull, that with a full fierce|ne&s;s ran upon <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> but coming near him vani&s;hed away. After|ward followed a great old ape, this ape offered <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> the hand, but he refu&s;ed; &s;o the ape ran out of the hall again.

For Hell is &s;aid to be deadly, out of which there never came any to life again but one, but he is nothing for thee to reckon upon; Hell is blood-thir&s;ty, and is never &s;atisfied: Hell is a vally into which the damned &s;ouls fall; for when the &s;oul is cut of man's body, it would gladly go to the place from whence it came, and climbeth up above the highe&s;t hills, even to the Heavens, where being by the Angels of the fir&s;t model denied entertain|ment (in con&s;ideration of their evil life &s;pent on earth) they fall into the deepe&s;t pit or valley, that hath no bottom, into a perpetual fire which &s;hall never be quenched. Therefore is Hell called everla&s;ting pain, in which is never hopes for mercy; &s;o it is called utter darkne&s;s, in which we &s;ee neither the light, the &s;un, moon, nor &s;tars; and were our

For out of the mightie&s;t potentates' courts in tho&s;e countries, he would &s;end his &s;pirit to fetch away their be&s;t cheer. And on a time being in his merriment, and banquetting with other &s;tudents in an inn there|unto re&s;orted many <HI>Jews;</HI> which when Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> perceived, he was minded to play a merry je&s;t to de|ceive a <HI>Jew,</HI> de&s;iring one of them to lend him &s;ome money for a time; the <HI>Jew</HI> was content, and lent <HI>Fau&s;|tus</HI> three&s;core dollars for a month, which time being expired, the <HI>Jew</HI> came for his money and intere&s;t; but <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> was never minded to pay the <HI>Jew</HI> again; at length the <HI>Jew</HI>

The <HI>Jew</HI> that never was a friend to a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> thought with him&s;elf, this fellow is right for my purpo&s;e, that will lay his limbs in pawn for money, and was therewith very well content: Wherefore Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> took a &s;aw, and therewith &s;eemed to cut of his leg, but not with&s;tand|ing he did not &s;o.

The <HI>Jew</HI> promi&s;ed to give him what mo|ney he would a&s;k, if he would not deal &s;trictly with him; wherefore the <HI>Jew</HI> was forced to give him &s;ixty dollars more to be rid of him, and yet <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> had his leg on, for he had but blinded the <HI>Jew.</HI></P>

N.</HI> This gentleman was far in love with a gentlewoman, &s;air and proper in per&s;onage; this gentlewo|man had a Knight that was a &s;uitor unto her, and many other gentlemen, which de&s;ired her in marriage, but none could obtain her. So it was that he fell in de&s;pair with him&s;elf, and pined away to &s;kin and bone: But when he opened the matter to Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> he a&s;ked coun&s;el of his <HI>Mepho&s;tophiles,</HI> the which told him what to do. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> went home to the gentleman, and bid him be of good chear, for he &s;hould have his de&s;ire, for he would help him to that he wi&s;hed for, and that this gentlewoman &s;hould love none other but him only. Where|fore
<PB N="86" REF="028655_0084_0FDBBF06C52E9578">Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> &s;o changed the mind of the dam&s;el by the practice he wrought, that &s;he could do no other thing but think on him, whom before &s;he had hated, neither cared &s;he for any man but him alone. The device was thus; <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> com|manded the gentleman that he &s;hould clothe him&s;elf in all the be&s;t apparel that he had, and that he &s;hould go unto the gentlewoman, and &s;hew him&s;elf, giving him a ring, com|manding him in any wi&s;e that he &s;hould dance with her before he de|parted; who following his coun&s;el, went to her, and when they began to dance, they that were &s;uitors, began to take every one his lady by the hand; this gentleman took her who before had &s;o di&s;dained him, and in the dance he put the ring into her hand, that <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> had given him, which &s;he no &s;ooner toucht, but &s;he fell pre&s;ently in love with him, &s;miling at him in the dance, and many times winking at him, rolling her eyes, and in the end &s;he a&s;ked him if he could love her, and
<PB N="87" REF="028655_0085_0FDBBF0A3949F078">make her his wife. He gladly an|&s;wered that he was content; where|upon they concluded, and were married by the means and help of <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> for which the gentleman well rewarded him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. <HI>An Oration of Dr. Fau&s;tus to the Students.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY tru&s;ty and well beloved friends, the cau&s;e why I have
<PB N="108" REF="028655_0106_0FDA3C93A9DEF2C8">invited you into this place, is this: For as much as you have known me the&s;e many years, what manner of life I have lived: practi&s;ing all manner of conjurations and wicked exerci&s;es, the which I obtained through the help of the Devil, into who&s;e devili&s;h fellow&s;hip they have brought me; the which u&s;e, the art and practice, urged by the dete&s;table provocation of my fle&s;h, and my &s;tiffneeked and rebellious, will, with my filthy infernal thoughts, the which were ever before me, pricking me forward &s;o earne&s;tly, that I mu&s;t perforce have the con&s;ent of the Devil to aid me in my devices. And to the end I might the better bring my purpo&s;e to pa&s;s, to have the Devil's aid and furtherance, which I never have wanted in my actions, I have promi&s;ed him at the end and accompli&s;hment of twenty four years, both body and &s;oul, to do therewith at his plea&s;ure; this di&s;|mal day, the&s;e twentyfour years are fully expired; for night beginning, my hourgla&s;s is at an end, and the
<PB N="109" REF="028655_0107_0FDA3CCC393C30F0">direful fini&s;hing whereof I carefully expect; for out of all doubt he will fetch me to whom I have given my|&s;elf in recompence of his &s;ervice, body and &s;oul; and twice confirmed writings with my proper blood: Now have I called you, my well beloved lords, friends and brethren, before that fatal hour, to take my friendly farewell, to the end that my departure may not hereafter be hid|den from you, be&s;eeching you here|with (courteous loving lords and brethren) not to take in evil part any thing done by me; but with friendly commendation to &s;alute all my friends and companions where|&s;oever, de&s;iring both you and them, if ever I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t your minds in any thing, that you would heartily forgive me; and as for tho&s;e lewd practices, the&s;e full twenty four years I have followed, you &s;hall afterwards find them in writing; and I be&s;eech you let this my la|mentable end, to the re&s;idue of your lives, be a &s;ufficient warning, that you have God always before your
<PB N="110" REF="028655_0108_0FDA3C9642A0AF08">eyes, praying unto him, that he will defend you from the tempta|tions of the Devil, and all his fal&s;e deceits, not falling altogether from God, as I wretched and ungodly damned creature have done, having denied and defied bapti&s;m, the &s;a|crament of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s body, God him|&s;elf, and heavenly powers and earthly men; yea, I have denied &s;uch a God, that de&s;ireth not to have one lo&s;t. Neither let the evil fellow&s;hip of wicked companions mi&s;lead you, as it hath done me; vi&s;it earne&s;tly and often the church; war and &s;trive continually again&s;t the Devil, with a good and &s;tedfa&s;t belief in <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and u&s;e your vocation and holine&s;s. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> to clo&s;e my troubled oration, this is my friendly reque&s;t, that you would go to re&s;t, and let nothing trouble you; al&s;o if you chance to hear any noi&s;e or tumbling about the hou&s;e, be not therewith afraid, for there &s;hall no evil happen unto you; al&s;o I pray you ri&s;e not out of your beds; but above all things, I intreat you, if
<PB N="111" REF="028655_0109_0FDA3CCEDEB0AC98">hereafter you find my dead carca&s;e, convey it into the earth, for I die both a good and bad <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> though I know the Devil will have thy body, and that would I willing|ly give him, &s;o that he would leave my &s;oul to quiet; wherefore I pray you, that you would depart to bed, and &s;o I with you a quiet night, which unto me, notwith&s;tanding, &s;hall be horrible and fearful.</P>
<P>This oration was made by <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> and that with a hearty and re&s;olute mind, to the end he might not di&s;|comfort them; but the &s;tudents wondered greatly thereat, that he was &s;o blinded, for knavery, conju|ration, and &s;uch fooli&s;h things, to give his body and &s;oul to the Devil; for they loved him entirely, and never &s;u&s;pected any &s;uch thing, be|fore he had opened his mind to them: wherefore one of them &s;aid unto him, ah! Friend <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> what have you done to conceal this matter &s;o long from us? We would by the help of good divines, and the grace of God, have brought you out of the
<PB N="112" REF="028655_0110_0FDA3C97DD44FB20">net, and have torn you out of the bondage and chains of &s;atan, whereas we fear now it is too late to the utter ruin both of body and &s;oul. Dr. <HI>Fau|&s;tus</HI> an&s;wered, I dur&s;t never do it al|though often minded to &s;ettle my&s;elf to godly people to de&s;ire coun&s;el and help, and once my old neighbour counfeled me, that I &s;hould follow his learning, and leave all my con|jurations: Yet when I was minded to amend, and to follow that good coun&s;el, then came the Devil and would have had me a way, as this night he is like to do; and &s;aid, &s;o &s;oon as I turned again to God, he would di&s;patch me altogether. Thus even thus, (good gentlemen and dear friends) was I inthralled in that fatal bond, all good de&s;ires drowned, all piety vani&s;hed, all purpo&s;e of amendment utterly exiled, by the tyrannous oppre&s;&s;ion of my deadly enemy. But when the &s;tudents heard his words they gave him coun&s;el to do nothing el&s;e but call upon God, de&s;iring him, for the love of his &s;weet &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t's
<PB N="113" REF="028655_0111_0FDA3CD0953B8C00">&s;ake to have mercy upon him: Teaching him this form of prayer: O God! Be merciful unto me, poor and mi&s;erable &s;inner; and en|ter not into judgment with me, for no fle&s;h is able to &s;tand before thee! although, O Lord! I mu&s;t leave my &s;inful body with the Devil, being by him deluded; yet thou in mercy may pre&s;erve my &s;oul.</P>
<P>This they repeated to him, yet he could take no hold: But even as <HI>Cain,</HI> he al&s;o &s;aid, That his &s;ins were greater than God was able to for|give. For all his thoughts was on the Writing, he meant he had made it too pithy in writing it with his own Blood. The Students and the others that were there, when they had pray|ed for him, they wept, and &s;o went forth; but <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> tarried in the hall, and when the gentlemen were laid in bed, none of them could &s;leep, for that they attended to hear if they might be privy to his End. It hap|pened that between twelve and one o'clock at midnight, there blew a mighty &s;torm of wind again&s;t the Hou&s;e, as though it would have
<PB N="114" REF="028655_0112_0FDA3C9B010F60A8">blown the foundation thereof out of its Place. Hereupon the Students began to fear, and go out of their beds, but they would not &s;tir out of the chamber, and the ho&s;t of the hou&s;e ran out of doors, thinking the hou&s;e would fall. The Students lay near unto the hall, wherein Dr. <HI>Fau|&s;tus</HI> lay, and they heard a mighty noi&s;e and hi&s;&s;ing, as if the hall had been full of &s;nakes and adders, with that the hall doors flew open, where|in Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> was, then he began to cry for help, &s;aying, murther! much ther! but it was with half a voice, and very hollow, &s;hortly after they heard him no more: But when it was day, the Students that had tak|en no re&s;t that night, aro&s;e and went into the hall, in which they left Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> where notwith&s;tanding they found not <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> but all the hall &s;prinkled with blood, the brains cleaving to the wall, for the devil had beaten him from one wall again&s;t another: in one corner lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a fearful and pitiful Sight to behold. Thon began the Stu|dents
<PB N="115" REF="028655_0113_0FDA3C8BD2503B80">to wail and weep for him, and &s;ought for his body in many places; la&s;tly, they came into the yard, where they &s;aw his body lying on the hor&s;e-dung, mo&s;t mon&s;trou&s;ly torn, and fearful to behold; for his head and all his joints were da&s;hed to pieces. The forenamed Students and Ma&s;ters that were at his death, have obtained &s;o much, that they buried him in the village where he was &s;o grievou&s;ly tormented. After which they returned to <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> and coming into the hou&s;e of <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> they found the &s;ervant of <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> very &s;ad, unto whom they opened all the matter, who took it exceed|ing heavily. There they found this hi&s;tory of Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> noted, and of him written, as is before declared; all &s;ave only his end, the which was after, by the Students, thereunto an|nexed. Farther what his &s;ervant noted thereof, was made in another book. And you have heard held by him in his life the &s;pirit of fair <HI>Hele|na,</HI> who had by him one &s;on, the which was named <HI>Ju&s;tus Fau&s;tus,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="028655_0114_0FDA3C9CD5813FC0">even the &s;ame day of his death they vani&s;hed away, both mother and &s;on. The hou&s;e before was &s;o dark, that &s;carce any body could abide therein. The &s;ame night Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> appeared to his &s;ervant lively, and &s;hewed un|to him many &s;ecret things which he had done, and hidden in his life-time. Likewi&s;e there were certain which &s;aw Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> look out of the win|dow by night, as they pa&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus ended the whole hi&s;tory of Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI>'s conjuration, and other acts that he did in his life; out of which example every chri&s;tian may learn; but chiefly the &s;tiffnecked, and highminded, may thereby learn to fear God, and to be careful of their vocation, and to be at defiance with all devili&s;h works, that God hath mo&s;t precifely forbidden; to the end we &s;hould not invite the Dev|il as a gue&s;t, nor give him place as that wicked <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> hath done: For here we have a wicked example of his writing, promi&s;e, and end, that we may remember him, that we go
<PB N="117" REF="028655_0115_0FDA3CD60B519928">not a&s;tray, but take God always be|fore our eyes, to call alone upon him, and to honour him all the days of our life, with heart, and hearty prayer, and with all our &s;trength and &s;oul, to glorify his holy name, defy|ing the devil and all his works; to the end we may remain with Chri&s;t in all endle&s;s joy, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI> That wi&s;h I to every chri&s;tian heart, and God's name be glorified.</P>

<HEAD>A Conjuring Tale.</HEAD>
<P>AT &s;uch time when Perukes were as &s;carce as money is now among&s;t mo&s;t men a gentleman who had lo&s;t his hair by a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, was forced with the fir&s;t to make u&s;e of one of them. It happened that he and his boy that attended on him, riding down into the country, there fell &s;uch a &s;hower of rain, which continued &s;o long as obliged them to take up their lodging at a paltry alehou&s;e in a country village, where &s;eeing the weather prove &s;o bad, he was re&s;olved to lie there for that night: After &s;ome &s;hort can|mons, which went by the name of a &s;upper, the gentleman was con|ducted to his lodging chamber, which was hung with cobwebs in|&s;tead of cloath of Arras; his boy al&s;o was &s;hewn to another chamber,
<PB N="131" REF="028655_0129_0FDA3CE80E236280">&s;omething inferiour you may be &s;ure to that of his ma&s;ter's; which was al&s;o richly hung with &s;piders tape&s;try, whil&s;t the gentleman was making him&s;elf ready, the maid peeped in at a hole under the door (which was made for the cat to go out and in) that when he was abed &s;he might fetch away the candle. Hav|ing undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he pulls off his Peruke, and &s;ets it upon a &s;tool by him, which the maid perceiving, verily imagined that he had pulled off his head; and &s;o conceited &s;he was of it, that &s;he ran down to her dame, telling him, that the gentleman who lodged there, was no other than an arrant conjurer, for &s;he &s;aw him with her own eyes pull off his head, and &s;et it on a &s;tool by him; and if &s;he doubted any thing of the truth thereof, if &s;he would go up, &s;he might &s;ee it &s;tanding there at that pre&s;ent. Her dame, though &s;omething hard of belief of what &s;he heard, yet to &s;atisfy her maid's curi|o&s;ity, went up; where peeping like|wi&s;e in at the hole, and &s;eeing it upon the &s;tool, &s;he was then of the &s;ame
<PB N="132" REF="028655_0130_0FDA3CB06A8DA188">opinion with her maid; and &s;o fear|ful they were both thereof, that nei|ther of them dur&s;t fetch the candle, and the gentleman was forced to put it out him&s;elf. That night was &s;pent in a great deal of fear, they judging that bad weather to proceed from the conjurer, and expecting yet wor&s;e; but when in the morning they &s;aw all fair, and a &s;erene &s;ky, they changed their opinion, and that tho' he was a conjurer, yet that now he would do no more harm. Whil&s;t they were now entered into this good opinion of him, one of her neigh|bours came in who had lo&s;t a hor&s;e, whom he judged to be &s;tole, for which he made a great complaint. Hold your peace, &s;aid &s;he, I can tell you a way which I warrant you will fetch your hor&s;e again: we have a conjurer that is now lodged in our hou&s;e, who for half a dozen of beer, I que&s;tion not but will do your bu&s;i|ne&s;s: and therewithal &s;he went up to the gentleman, acquainting him with her neighbour's lo&s;s, and de&s;ir|ing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for gaining him
<PB N="133" REF="028655_0131_0FDA3CB2605AF198">again; for, &s;aid &s;he, I know you have &s;kill in the black art, my maid and I &s;eeing your head la&s;t night up|on the &s;tool, when as the re&s;t of your body was gone to bed. The gentle|man perceiving her folly in her grand mi&s;take, and willing to have &s;ome mirth after his wet journey, told her, that for her &s;ake he would do his be&s;t endeavour for her neigh|bour; and that when he was ready, he would rai&s;e a &s;pirit which would quickly tell him where the hor&s;e was. The woman overjoyed at the&s;e words ran down and told her neigh|bour that he would have his hor&s;e again within an hour, and that if he would &s;tay &s;o long, he &s;hould &s;ee him come galloping to him again in a full career; this news plea&s;ed him &s;o well, that he re&s;olved to &s;tay. In the mean time the gentleman was con&s;ulting with him&s;elf how to bring his purpo&s;e the be&s;t way to effect: In order thereto, he told his boy that he mu&s;t act the part of a dev|il; and to per&s;onate him the better, whil&s;t I am gone down to &s;peak with them about the bu&s;ine&s;s do
<PB N="134" REF="028655_0132_0FDA3CB667C2D158">you turn your coat the wrong &s;ide outwards, and creep under the bed where you mu&s;t lie till I &s;peak the&s;e words, <HI>Elhavareuna, Phon&s;onthon|chya, Heydonicus Towronus Dunge|onis Keptoribus;</HI> then do you come forth from under the bed, and make as hideous a noi&s;e with your mouth as you can po&s;&s;ible. The boy prom|i&s;ed to do as he bid him; and when his ma&s;ter was gone down, he went about his bu&s;ine&s;s; but remembering with him&s;elf, that in the chamber where he lodged, there lay a raw bulls hide, left there by &s;ome butcher he thought that would per&s;onate the Devil far better than his coat; and thereupon he &s;udenly fetched it, and wrapped him&s;elf therein, with the horns apearing ju&s;t over his head; which having done, he crept under the bed, expecting the event: Soon after he was fixed, came up his ma&s;ter, the dame, the maid, and the fellow that had lo&s;t his hor&s;e; when the gentleman having a chalk|&s;tone in his hand, marked them every one out a circle; then placing them therein, he bid them not to &s;tir
<PB N="135" REF="028655_0133_0FDA3CEA1C15BA50">out of them, whatever they &s;aw: So pulling a book out of his pocket, he began to read &s;ome hard uncouth names, and at la&s;t came to tho&s;e words, <HI>Elhavareuna,</HI> &amp;c. when the boy made his appearance from under the bed, with a great pair of horns and a bellowing noi&s;e: His ma&s;ter, who knew not of his boy's new in|vention for acting the devil, &s;eeing &s;uch a hideous thing to appear, thought it had been the devil indeed who had come to have puni&s;hed him for undertaking to conjure, and thereupon he ran as fa&s;t as he could drive, making but one &s;tep from the top of the &s;tairs to the bottom: The woman and the man &s;eeing the gentleman run, thought likewi&s;e the devil was come to fetch them for being &s;pectators, and there|upon ran as fa&s;t as he, tumbling down the &s;tairs on the neck of one another. The boy &s;eeing them all run in &s;uch di&s;order, thought al&s;o that the devil was indeed come for him for acting his part, and there|fore he began to throw off his cov|ering; but he had before &s;o fa&s;tened
<PB N="136" REF="028655_0134_0FDA3CB7DC96EC88">it upon him, that &s;eeing he could not pull it off, he ran with it on; when coming to the top of the &s;tairs, the hide &s;o wrapped about his legs that it threw him from the top to the bottom among&s;t them; when they hearing the horns to make a clattering, &s;o &s;hrieked and bellowed as if the devil had been among&s;t them indeed. Sad was the effects of this their conjuring: One had his no&s;e broke, another his &s;hins, &s;ome hurt their elbows, &s;ome their thighs, and others their backs, the gentleman lo&s;t his Peruke, the wom|en fell with their heels upwards; and to conclude, not any one of them &s;ped &s;o well, but he had more occa|&s;ion for a &s;urgeon than a conjurer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Je&s;uit <HI>and</HI> Friar.</HEAD>
<P>A Je&s;uit preaching at the great church in <HI>Padua,</HI> towards the end of his &s;ermon, fell into a large
<PB N="137" REF="028655_0135_0FDA3CEBE1600D58">commendation of the order of the Je&s;uits, extolling it above all, the religous orders that then were, or ever had been in the world, giving God thanks, that he had the happi|ne&s;s to be of that order, and in the clo&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e, he told his au|ditory that he would acquaint them with a vi&s;ion which he had lately &s;een. The other night, &s;aid he, I dreamed that I was in hell, where methought I &s;aw Popes, Emperors, Kings, Queens, Cardinals, Bi&s;hops, Abbots, Monks, Friars, and &s;ome of all &s;orts of men, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular, but not one Je&s;uit among&s;t them all; which made me to ble&s;s God that ever I was born to be of &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a &s;ociety, which though it had &s;ent &s;o many thou&s;ands of that holy order to the grave, yet never any of them went to hell; and &s;o he concluded his &s;ermon with a fre&s;h encomium on the &s;ociety of Je&s;uits. The next <HI>funday</HI> after, a dommican fryar preached in the &s;ame church, and he al&s;o, towards the end of his &s;ermon, fell upon the high prai&s;es of the order of the Je|&s;uits;
<PB N="138" REF="028655_0136_0FDA3CBACA6E22B0">repeating much of the Je&s;uit's &s;ermon the day before, and bewail|ing him&s;elf that it was not his for|tune to be of that holy order, where|of none ever went to Hell, as the reverend father had told them the day before; at la&s;t he told the people, that he had al&s;o &s;een a vi&s;ion, and dreamed likewi&s;e one night that he was in Hell, where he &s;aw popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and all &s;orts of orders, as the Je&s;uit had not|ably &s;hewed them the day before; but not a Je&s;uit (&s;aid thefryar) could be &s;een among them all. Then thought I to my&s;elf, O what a ble&s;&s;ed order is this, that there &s;hould not be a Je&s;uit there! and &s;till I ca&s;t my eyes all over hell, wi&s;hing my&s;elf had been a Je&s;uit and not a dominican, to &s;ee not one piece of that order there. At la&s;t methought I beckoned a little Devil to me, and a&s;ked him &s;oftly in his ear, whether there were any Je&s;uits in that place or not? He an&s;wered, that there were none there, but that they were kept in a Hell by them&s;elves, which is a great room under this,
<PB N="139" REF="028655_0137_0FDA3CEFACB34C60">where (&s;aid the Devil,) there be abundance of them; and they come hither &s;o fa&s;t, that my ma&s;ter <HI>Lu|cifer</HI> &s;carce knows where to be&s;tow them; and be&s;ides they are &s;o un|ruly that if they were not kept by them&s;elves, every body would be &s;oon weary of this place: Adding withal, that his ma&s;ter dur&s;t not let them have any gunpowder, for fear they &s;hould blow up Hell it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>No Wit like a Woman's</HEAD>
<P><HI>ACARPENTER</HI> had married a very hand&s;ome woman to his wife, but that &s;he wearing cork&s;hoes, it made her light heel'd. This <HI>car|penter</HI> u&s;ed to work about a mile from home: but for the love he bore to his wife, he would every night come back to bed with her, although it &s;eemed, &s;he had rather have had his Room than his Com|pany; for no &s;ooner was he gone, but his Place was &s;upplied by anoth|er, whom &s;he loved more dearly; his next Neighbour, who by Trade was a <HI>Grocer.</HI> It happened one Morn|ing,
<PB N="140" REF="028655_0138_0FDA3CBBB4C0BED8">that the <HI>carpenter</HI> went for that he was accu&s;tomed; but before his Place was cold, another was gotten therein. He had not gone a Quarter of a Mile, but there fell &s;uch a Show|er of Rain, with Likelihood of Con|tinuance, that he returned back again, and drawing the Latch, went into the hou&s;e; which the <HI>Grocer</HI> hear|ing, crept out of Bed and got under|neath it as fa&s;t as he could. It being not yet Day, the Carpenter pulled off his clothes and went to bed; where he had not lain above a quar|ter of an hour, but it cea&s;ed raining, gave great hopes of a fair day; which the good wife perceiving &s;eared her lover would catch cold by being without his clothes under|neath the bed, &s;he jogged her hu&s;|band, telling him now the &s;ky was very clear, and therefore de&s;ired him to ri&s;e and go to work. The <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who was very ob&s;ervant to his wife, did accordingly; but it became &s;o dark that he could not &s;ee, he mi&s;took, and put on the <HI>Grocer</HI>'s breeches in&s;tead of his own; and &s;o go|ing his journey, when putting his hands
<PB N="141" REF="028655_0139_0FDA3CF312D05860">in his pocket to pull out his com|pa&s;&s;es, he found there a handful of money, at which he much marvel|led, knowing not how it &s;hould come there; only he thought it was no bad luck to have his pockets &s;o lined; yet was he in a quandary whether he was a wake or in a dream, he being &s;eldom ma&s;ter of &s;uch a purcha&s;e. Putting his hand in his other pocket, he found there a bunch of keys, a note book, and &s;ome other papers; which increa&s;ed his wonder more then before: But look|ing down towards his legs, he &s;aw the breeches were all full of ribbands, whereas his own never had one on them. Not knowing what to think thereof, he re&s;olved to go home and confer with his wife. In the mean time the <HI>Grocer</HI> mi&s;&s;ed his breeches, and telling the good wife thereof, they knew not what to do, only &s;he thought it was his be&s;t way not to &s;tay, judging her hu&s;band had got|ten them on, which might occa&s;ion his &s;udden return. And indeed her &s;u&s;picion proved true; but the hu&s;|band returned home, where he
