<HEAD>A LETTER &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 1752.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS your Relation to the Legi&s;lature of this Pro|vince (as an honourable Member of the Great and General Court or A&s;&s;embly) gives you an Opportunity; &s;o I am per&s;waded, you are very &s;en&s;ible that you are under proportionable Obligations to &s;tudy the Welfare of the People of this Province, not only by promoting and forwarding of &s;uch Acts and Laws, as are or may be found nece&s;&s;ary for the Encouragement of Virtue and true Religion, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Vice and Immorality, but al&s;o by di&s;countenancing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch Oppre&s;&s;ions as (under Colour of Law) are at any Time exerci&s;ed, to Infringe the ju&s;t Rights of Con&s;ci|ence, in Matters of Religion. And whereas an Opinion &s;eems to have generally prevailed among the People of this Province, That in every Town and Precinct (except the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) All the Inhabitants, are by the Laws of this Pro|vince, obliged to pay to the Settlement and Support, of &s;uch a Mini&s;ter as the major Part agree upon, unle&s;s a minor Part (di&s;&s;enting) do profe&s;s them&s;elves to be of the Epi&s;copal, Anabapti&s;t, or Quakers Per&s;wa&s;ion; I per&s;wade my &s;elf, you will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that &s;uch an Opinion (fathered on our
<PB REF="007037_0003_102AECD93AC29658">Province Laws) carries in it very undue Reflections upon our honourable Legi&s;lature, and repre&s;ents our Laws, either un|ju&s;t and partial, or incon&s;i&s;tent one with another; whereas if the Word <HI>All</HI> in our Laws, might be allowed to intend, no more than is commonly intended thereby, in &s;acred Writ, there would be no Colour for &s;uch a Pretence. And mu&s;t it not be very ab&s;urd to imagine, That our honourable Legi&s;la|ture intended any other by the Word <HI>All,</HI> than All who did, or ought to attend <HI>that</HI> Mini&s;try, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch as con&s;ci|enciou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent therefrom? Or that when they in very ex|pre&s;s Terms, enacted, that <Q>each re&s;pective gathered Church in any Town or Precinct within this Province, that at any Time &s;hall be in want of a Mini&s;ter, &s;uch Church &s;hall have Power, according to the Directions given in the Word of GOD, to cho&s;e their own Mini&s;ter</Q>? That, that ho|nourable Court intended thereby no greater Liberty to con&s;|ciencious Di&s;&s;enters, than the Egyptian Monarch propo&s;ed to grant to the Children of I&s;rael, when he &s;aid, <HI>Go ye, &s;erve the Lord, only let your Flocks and your Herds be &s;tayed.</HI> Or that they were influenced meerly from politick Motives, and not from a religious Regard to the Rights of Con&s;cience, and the Rules of commutative Ju&s;tice, in freeing the E&s;tates of the Members of Epi&s;copal and Anabapti&s;t Churches, and the People called Quakers, from &s;upporting a Mini&s;try in which their Con&s;ciences do not acquiecs;e?</P>
<P>Surely, &s;uch a wi&s;e, religious and Prote&s;tant Legi&s;lature (being al&s;o them&s;elves Di&s;&s;enters) could neither thro' Igno|rance of the Nature of Religion, or the Nature and Office of Con&s;cience, be brought to &s;uppo&s;e, that true Religion is to be propagated by external Force or Compul&s;ion; or that Con&s;cience (even tho' it be erroneous) is in &s;uch a Way, or by &s;uch Means, to be regulated or rectified. Nor could they be &s;o inadvertent as to determine, That <HI>all</HI> the Inhabitants of a Town or Precinct, where &s;ome are of the Calvini&s;tical and others of the Arminian or Latitudinarian Per&s;wa&s;ion, might con&s;i&s;tent with a good Con&s;cience (that is, without &s;infully counteracting the Dictates of their own Con&s;ciences) continue together as one Congregation: Or, that it can be po&s;&s;ible, that any one Mini&s;ter &s;hould &s;o di&s;pen&s;e the Word of God, in &s;uch a mixed A&s;&s;embly, as to An&s;wer (in the Opinion of All) the great End of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007037_0004_102AECD3A10C7EB8">
I am therefore per&s;waded, that it never was the Intent of the Law, that all without Di&s;tinction, &s;hould be taxed to|wards the Support of a Mini&s;try in which the Con&s;ciences of &s;ome cannot acquie&s;ce; yet I earne&s;tly wi&s;h, that our Laws were rendered more plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood in their genuine Sen&s;e and Meaning.</P>
<P>I covet for my &s;elf and mine, the Enjoyment of a learned, as well as pious and orthodox Mini&s;try; and count it a &s;in|gular Favour of Heaven, which calls for great Admiration, as well as Thankfulne&s;s, that in our degenerate Age, there are any, and &s;o many, faithful Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters continued in our Land: And I wi&s;h they may ever be duly encouraged and &s;upported; but I am not able to di&s;cover any Scripture-Foundation for any Act or Acts of the Civil Authority to compel any who con&s;cienciou&s;ly and on the Account of a different under&s;tanding of the Meaning of the Scriptures, do di&s;&s;ent even from the Mini&s;try of &s;uch as by the major Part are e&s;teemed to be the mo&s;t eminent, to hear, or pay for, &s;uch Preaching, as they apprehend to be di&s;agreable to the great End of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Can &s;uch Compul&s;ion be reconciled to the Rules of Equity and Ju&s;tice? Can it be founded on, yea, is it not directly contrary to, the Example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and to the Practi&s;e of the primitive Churches, who neither u&s;ed them&s;elves, nor pre&s;cribed to &s;ucceeding Ages, any compul|&s;ive Methods to bring Men to embrace the Go&s;pel? And are not per&s;wa&s;ive and convictive Arguments for the enlight|ning of the Mind, the only Scripture Method to promote &s;incere Religion?</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to me, That notwith&s;tanding the plain Evidence we have of the Spread of the Go&s;pel over the whole World, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate, that it &s;hould now become &s;o general an Opinion. That Churches mu&s;t needs be brought into Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, be crumbled to Pieces, their Foundation raz'd &amp;c. unle&s;s all the Inhabitants in each Town and Precinct (tho' con&s;i&s;ting of a mixed Number of People of very different Per&s;wa&s;ions in Points of Doctrine) be compel|led to join in &s;upporting &s;uch as Mini&s;try, as is agreeable to the Mind of a major Part.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007037_0005_102AECDB961292E0">
But &s;ince there is a &s;uch a Thing as a &s;piritual, as well as corporeal Sen&s;ation, can there be any Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, why the Choice of Food for our Souls, any more than for our Bodies, &s;hould be refer'd to the Judgment (not to &s;ay Hu|mours) of other Men? Yet I am per&s;waded, that if it were but &s;u&s;pected, that any Laws of the Province had put it in the Power of a major Part, to provide a co&s;tly Entertain|ment, for the whole Town, once a Week, and to compel every one to pay his Part of the Co&s;t, it would rai&s;e a grievous Hubbub, and People would be apt to think it an Infringe|ment upon their natural Rights, as Men, that other Men &s;hould chu&s;e their Diet: and that it was unrea&s;onable to com|pel them to pay for the Provi&s;ion, if they found it &s;o un&s;avoury that they could not eat it; and much more if they were a&s;&s;ur|ed that &s;omething of a poi&s;onous Quality, or that had a Ten|dency to breed Di&s;ea&s;es in the Body, was mixed with it. Now, in as much as the Care of every Man's own Soul is peculiarly belonging to him&s;elf, and is of infinitely greater Importance than the Concerns of the Body; and we are pathetically cau|tioned to take Heed both how, &amp; what we hear. To beware of fal&s;e Teachers &amp; corrupt Doctrines, and are expre&s;ly required to cea&s;e from hearing the In&s;truction that cau&s;eth to err from the Words of Knowledge, it cannot be le&s;s rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary (but va&s;tly more &s;o) that every Man be left entirely free, to act according to the Dictates of his own Un|der&s;tanding, in the Choice of his &s;piritual Food, and to put him&s;elf under &s;uch a Mini&s;try as he apprehends to be agrea|ble to the Mind of Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently mo&s;t likely to &s;ub&s;erve his own Edification.</P>
<P>And all Attempts to di&s;enable a minor Party in any Town or Precinct for, or with Re&s;pect to the Support of &s;uch an agreeable Mini&s;try for them&s;elves (by wre&s;ting their E&s;tates from them towards the Support of a Mini&s;try, in which their Con&s;ciences cannot acquie&s;ce) are far from having a Tendency to promote Go&s;pel Order, or the Growth of Chri&s;tianity, and di&s;covers more of an Anti-Chri&s;tian per&s;ecuting Spirit and Temper, than a De&s;ire to advance the Intere&s;t of Peace Truth and Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>And whereas &s;ome object, That if &s;uch a Freedom from Taxations for the Support of the &s;tanding Mini&s;try, be allow|ed to a minor Party, that this would open a Door for Men,
<PB REF="007037_0006_102AECD52978BEB8">meerly out of Prejudice, yet under a Pretence of Con&s;cience, to &s;et up &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies: I would only inquire, Whether that Door be not already open for &s;uch Separations as tho&s;e, by the Acts formerly made to free the Members of Epi&s;co|pal and Anabapti&s;t Churches, and the People called <HI>Quakers;</HI> and whether tho&s;e Acts do any more than only put them into actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Rights of humane Nature, which ju&s;tly belonged to them before tho&s;e Acts were pa&s;&s;ed, and which cannot be ju&s;tly denied to any of His Maje&s;ty's Pro|te&s;tant Subjects of this Province.</P>
<P>Another Objection which I have &s;ometimes heard is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That to oblige all to pay to the &s;tanding Mini&s;try, is agreeable to the Wi&s;dom of the Nation; Di&s;&s;enters, notwith|&s;tanding the Act of Toleration, are obliged to pay Tythes, by which the &s;tanding Mini&s;try is &s;upported.</P>
<P>I reply to this Objection, That our Predece&s;&s;ors in this Land di&s;claimed any Pretence to a National or Provincial Con&s;titution of Churches; and in as much as our Churches here are Congregational, and with Re&s;pect to their Eccele&s;i|a&s;tical Con&s;titution, and Mode of Wor&s;hip, are very different from that of the National Church, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why the whole Regimen, Services and Ceremonies of the National Church, may not be urged for our Imitation, with as great Force and Strength of Argument, as tho&s;e National Acts, which oblige Di&s;&s;enters there, to bear a Part in the Charge of the Incumbents. And verily, if I thought (as it &s;eems Multitudes do) that our Laws have ve&s;ted a Majority in each Town and Precinct, with a Power of impo&s;ing mini&s;terial Rates or Taxes, at their Plea&s;ure, upon &s;uch as di&s;&s;ent from them in their Choice of a Mini&s;ter, I could &s;ee no Grounds to hope that the Per&s;ecution would &s;top here, but think that a Door is &s;et open to proceed from this, to the highe&s;t De|gree of Per&s;ecution, and &s;hould be ready to expect that in a &s;hort Time Di&s;&s;enters will be favoured with at lea&s;t as much Freedom and Liberty of Con&s;cience, under the Government of LORD DIOCESAN, as under the popular Authority of LORD MAJORITY.</P>
<P>And now (Honoured Sir,) Since our Laws are con&s;trued by many to intend &s;uch a Power, I refer to your &s;uperiour Judgment, whether Rea&s;on and Religion, as well as the ju&s;t Vindication of the Laws of this Province (relating to the
<PB N="7" REF="007037_0007_102AECDD871B6D70">Settlement and Support of Mini&s;ters) from &s;uch A&s;per&s;ions, does not require, that &s;omething be done, in a very explicit Manner, to re&s;cue them from &s;uch Mi&s;con&s;tructions, and prevent their being abu&s;ed to Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;pi|ritual Tyranny? &s;ad In&s;tances whereof, have already been, in &s;everal Places in our Land. So re&s;ts,</P>
