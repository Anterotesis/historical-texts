<P>THE pious and honourable founder of this Lecture having a&s;&s;igned <HI>revealed religion</HI> as one of the &s;ubjects of inve&s;tigation, the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e is to con&s;ider &s;ome of the principal evidences on which the truth of re|velation re&s;ts. It mu&s;t be obvious to every one who is acquainted with the &s;ubject, that a wide and exten&s;ive field opens to view, and that to traver&s;e the &s;everal parts, mu&s;t va&s;tly exceed the limits of a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;Several able and worthy divines who have preceded me on this &s;ubject, have confined them&s;elves to &s;ome particu|lar branch of it. One di&s;cour&s;e was limited to this &s;ingle point, to prove that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the Rev. Mr. Barnard of Marblehead.</NOTE>. The &s;ole object of another, was to con&s;ider that part of the evidence which ari&s;es from miracles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By the Rev. Mr. Barnard of Salem.</NOTE>&mdash;Others, who have
<PB N="4" REF="021142_0003_0FB2537274854448">al&s;o been eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, have taken a brief view of the &s;everal parts of this copious &s;ubject. I confe&s;s that the fir&s;t of the&s;e methods has &s;truck me as be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution. The internal evidence of chri&s;tianity ari&s;ing from the peculiar excellen|cy of its doctrines and precepts, de&s;erves parti|cular attention. The exact accompli&s;hment of a va&s;t variety of prophecies in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pe|riods of the world, many of which re&s;pect im|portant events which fall within our own ob&s;er|vation, affords a &s;trong and undeniable argument of the truth of revelation. The evidence ari&s;ing from the miracles of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, how|ever derided by &s;ome and mi&s;under&s;tood by others, will always have great weight with every unprejudiced mind.&mdash;Among the various incon|te&s;tible proofs of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, his re|&s;urrection from the dead, is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important. This is the grand ba&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem; the corner-&s;tone on which the whole building re&s;ts. For as St. Paul argues, if Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en, our preaching is vain, and your faith is vain al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15. 14.</NOTE>.&mdash;Infidels, aware of the impor|tance of this fact to the chri&s;tian faith, have em|ployed much art and addre&s;s in attempting to overthrow it. Their objections however have paved the way for the fulle&s;t inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject, and the truth has been &s;et in a clear view. However it may have happened, this particular point has not been con&s;idered on this occa&s;ion; which together with its magnitude and impor|tance &s;hall be my apology for paying &s;ome atten|tion to it.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021142_0004_0FB2537530B8F238">
That there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us of Na|zareth, who appeared on the &s;tage of human life more than &s;eventeen hundred years ago, who delivered a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines and laws, and performed a variety of wonderful works in &s;up|port of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, is a fact mo&s;t clear and indi&s;putable.&mdash;In this re&s;pect the friends and enemies of chri&s;tianity are perfectly agreed. Cel&s;us, Porphyry, Heriocles and Julian the apo&s;|tate with other inveterate enemies of the chri&s;ti|an cau&s;e, are compelled to acknowledge this truth&mdash;Neither is there any di&s;pute with re&s;pect to the crucifixion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t at Jeru&s;alem, in the reign of Tiberius Ce&s;ar the Roman Em|peror. The Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts and rulers, who mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed to prevent the &s;pread of chri&s;ti|anity, with &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;torians bear the fulle&s;t te&s;timony to this truth But the ca&s;e is far other|wi&s;e with re&s;pect to the re&s;urrection of our Lord. From the time that the Sanhedrim hired the Roman &s;oldiers to declare that the di&s;ciples &s;tole away the body while they &s;lept to the pre&s;ent day, various objections have been urged to inva|lidate the truth of this important fact. Before we proceed to a direct con&s;ideration of the &s;ub|ject, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the nature of evidence in general, and that kind of evidence in particular, which might rea&s;onably be expected in atte&s;tation of a revelation from heaven.</P>
<P>"Evidence is the clear manife&s;tation of truth to the mind, producing a ready a&s;&s;ent to it." Sometimes we di&s;cover truth by &s;trict mathema|tical demon&s;tration. From certain axioms or
<PB N="6" REF="021142_0005_0FB253810605A040">&s;elf-evident principles we arrive by various gra|dations at other truths; &s;o that where the whole proce&s;s is under&s;tood, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of doubt. In this ca&s;e, the premi&s;es are of &s;uch a nature as to render us infallibly certain of the conclu&s;ion.&mdash;In other in&s;tances, our a&s;&s;ent is grounded upon the <HI>te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es.</HI> To this evidence St. John refers when he &s;ays, that which we have heard, which we have &s;een with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, declare we unto you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John 1. 1.</NOTE>. This is a kind of evidence mo&s;t full and &s;atisfactory, to which an appeal is always made, for the determination of the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing and important affairs in life. To reject the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es would imply a gro&s;s re|flection on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of our cre|ator. This would be to &s;uppo&s;e that he has by the con&s;titution of our nature &s;ubjected us to unavoidable deception.</P>
<P>A third kind of evidence on which a&s;&s;ent is grounded, is <HI>credible te&s;timony,</HI> or the concurrent declaration of faithful witne&s;&s;es with re&s;pect to certain facts which have fallen within their cog|nizance. With this proof men admit the truth of all pa&s;t tran&s;actions. All hi&s;torical facts, from the beginning of the world to the pre&s;ent day, depend upon it. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and the &s;upport of civil government in the world, re&s;t upon this ba&s;is. Without this kind of evi|dence a great part of the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge mu&s;t be given up. Upon this idea, as one ob|&s;erves, no &s;ort of di&s;covery, no experiment or ob|&s;ervation
<PB N="7" REF="021142_0006_0FB253890143BB00">which a man does not make him&s;elf, or &s;ee with his own eyes; nay nor any demon&s;tra|ble truth which he did not demon&s;trate him&s;elf is ever to be admitted or made u&s;e of, either by way of argument in di&s;cour&s;e, or as a premi&s;e in any demon&s;tration in order either to theory or practice. Every man mu&s;t &s;tand upon the ba&s;is of his own proper knowledge without light or information, without hints or &s;ugge&s;tions from others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ditton.</NOTE>.&mdash;It has been alledged by de &s;tical writ|ers, that the external evidence of chri&s;tianity is dimini&s;hed by time, and that the very nature of probability is &s;uch, that were it left to time it&s;elf, even that would wear it quite out. This repre|&s;entation is altogether inadmi&s;&s;ible: For though the minds of men may be much le&s;s affected with remote tran&s;actions than with tho&s;e which are re|cent, a fact which has once been &s;ufficiently at|te&s;ted always claims our belief, unle&s;s contrary evidence is adduced. For in&s;tance, it is now as firmly believed that Julius Ce&s;ar was &s;lain in the &s;enate-hou&s;e, as that General Montgomery fell before the walls of Quebec. If it was of the na|ture of credibility to be thus de&s;troyed, all true hi&s;tory mu&s;t by degrees degenerate into mere fable and faction. What is credible to day would perhaps be incredible to morrow. No real di&s;tinction could be left on this &s;uppo&s;ition between truth and fal&s;hood, but we mu&s;t be in a &s;tate of endle&s;s fluctuation and uncertainty. The truth is, mankind have never been in doubt with regard to a multitude of pa&s;t facts and re|mote tran&s;actions. Modern infidels who urge this ca&s;e the ravages of time, have never pre|&s;umed
<PB N="8" REF="021142_0007_0FB2538BE78BEAA8">to doubt the &s;urprizing victories of Alex|ander the great, that the ancient Romans &s;ubdu|ed all the neighbouring nations, or that they de|&s;troyed and burnt the famous city of Carthage. In all ca&s;es where chri&s;tianity is not concerned, they admit the&s;e ancient facts without the lea&s;t he&s;itation. It di&s;covers extreme unfairne&s;s to receive this kind of proof in all other in&s;tances, and to reject it as applied to religion.</P>
<P>A being of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s has been plea&s;ed to re&s;t the truth of revelation princi|pally on this kind of evidence. Chri&s;tianity makes no preten&s;ions to &s;trict demon&s;tration; neither are all men indulged the te&s;timony of their own &s;en&s;|es; but tho&s;e important facts on which the truth of it depends, are atte&s;ted by credible witne&s;&s;es; who had neither ability nor inclination to impo&s;e a fal&s;hood upon the world, and who&s;e whole character bears the marks of the &s;tricte&s;t inte|grity. On this evidence chri&s;tians in all ages, have admitted the truth of our Saviour's re&s;ur|rection, that mo&s;t important fact which lies at the foundation of the whole &s;y&s;tem. If agreea|bly to the language of the text, God the father has declared Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be his &s;on, by rai&s;|ing him from the dead, no man can refu&s;e to ad|mit the truth of <HI>his mi&s;&s;ion</HI> who believes the per|fections of deity. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any one who owns the truth of natural religion &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that a being of infinite wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and veracity &s;hould ever &s;et his &s;eal to a lie, or give the be&s;t credentials to an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>The way being now in &s;ome mea&s;urs prepar|ed, we proceed to con&s;ider the &s;everal proofs of
<PB N="9" REF="021142_0008_0FB25393906E40C8">the reality of our Saviour's re&s;urrection.&mdash;That HE to whom all power belongs, can with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e rai&s;e one from the dead, is a point too clear to be called in que&s;tion. However impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch an event may be to any &s;econd cau&s;e, there is nothing in it which implies any ab&s;urdity or contradiction. HE, who&s;e creative hand gave exi&s;tence to unnumbered worlds, and to the various orders of creatures which inhabit them, and who e&s;tabli&s;hed all tho&s;e laws by which the general &s;y&s;tem is governed, mu&s;t infallibly have the &s;upreme direction and controul&mdash;As the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t was evidently a &s;ubject of ancient prophecy, and as he had frequently declared that he mu&s;t &s;uffer death and ri&s;e again the third day, the Jewi&s;h rulers took the mo&s;t effectual precautions to prevent any fraud.&mdash;They &s;aid to Pilate, Sir we remember that this deceiver &s;aid while he was yet alive, after three days I will ri&s;e again; command therefore that the &s;epulchre be made &s;ure till the third day, le&s;t his di&s;ciples come by night and &s;teal him away, and &s;ay unto the people, he is ri&s;en from the dead. So the la&s;t error &s;hall be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. Pilate &s;aid unto them, ye have a watch, go your way, make it as &s;ure as you can; &s;o they went and made the &s;epulchre &s;ure &s;ealing the &s;tone and &s;etting a watch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew 27. 63, 64.</NOTE>. As the predicti|on had fixed the third day for his re&s;urrection, by having the dead body in their cu&s;tody till af|ter that day, they imagined they &s;hould abun|dantly defeat it, and know they had nothing to fear from it afterwards. Human policy could
<PB N="10" REF="021142_0009_0FB2539E9F534D68">not have adopted a more effectual method to prevent all fraud than that which was cho&s;en by the Jewi&s;h rulers. The &s;epulchre was hewed out of a &s;olid rock, and delivered to a company of &s;oldiers with orders from their officer to guard it. But what are guards and centinels again&s;t the power of almighty God! An angel of the Lord opened the &s;epulchre, the guards &s;aw him and became as dead men. Terrified at the earthquake, and the radiant appearance of this heavenly me&s;&s;enger, &s;ome of them pre|&s;ently repaired to the city, and gave information to the chief prie&s;ts and rulers, of tho&s;e things which had hapened. It &s;eems highly probable from what followed, that the &s;oldiers were actu|al witne&s;&s;es of the re&s;urrection of Jeius. The deliberations of the Sanhedrim on this &s;ubject, and the mea&s;ures which they took to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;tory, plainly &s;uppo&s;e that the guard a&s;&s;ured them of the reality of his re&s;urrection. Our Lord is indeed &s;aid to have appeared <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to Mary Magdalene. This declaration is perfect|ly con&s;i&s;tent with the idea that the &s;oldiers law him when he came out of the tomb. For that could not &s;o properly be called an appearance after the re&s;urrection, as the re&s;urrection it&s;elf.</P>
<P>However this might be, our Lord &s;hewed him&s;elf alive after his pa&s;&s;ion by many infallible proofs, being &s;een of his di&s;ciples forty days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 1. 3.</NOTE>. Dei&s;tical writers have fondly repre&s;ented the accounts which the &s;everal Evangeli&s;ts have giv|en of this important fact as being incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="11" REF="021142_0010_0FB253AFE7B54C68">with, and contradictory to, each other and there|fore, not worthy of credit.&mdash;Though there may be &s;ome di&s;agreement, as to certain minute cir|cum&s;tances, yet their te&s;timony to the &s;ect it&s;elf, is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame. Their &s;everal relati|ons are of &s;uch a kind as to &s;hew that there was no collu&s;ion in the matter, nor any preconcerted plan with re&s;pect to their narration. Each one declared what he &s;aw or heard in &s;uch order as &s;eemed mo&s;t natural, and in a manner mo&s;t &s;imple and unadorned. Had the four Evange|li&s;ts, &s;ays one, written exactly in the &s;ame order, related only the &s;ame facts, reported only the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;es, and reported them in the &s;ame words, I doubt not but oar enemies would have cried out plain juggle and impo&s;ture! How is it po&s;&s;ible the&s;e writers &s;hould have &s;o exactly agreed in all the&s;e circum&s;tances, had they not concerted the&s;e matters together, and re&s;olved each to &s;upport the others account; or if each &s;ucceeding writer had not taken his account from the former, whereby in &s;tead of being four di&s;|tinct witne&s;&s;es, they are in reality but one! And the objection from hence would have been &s;tron|ger &s;ays he, than I have &s;een it drawn from any other article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Chandler.</NOTE>. Several writers of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities have con&s;idered, and compleatly refut|ed the objections drawn from the &s;eeming incon|&s;i&s;tency of the witne&s;&s;es. The plan &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. We&s;t is perhaps on the whole, mo&s;t un|exceptionable. It is needle&s;s to recite particu|larly the mode which he has adopted. To &s;ave time, I mu&s;t refer you to the work it&s;elf, and
<PB N="12" REF="021142_0011_0FB253C3CD011DE8">proceed to con&s;ider the number of witne&s;&s;es atte&s;t|ing this fact, their character their &s;tedfa&s;t adherence to their declaration amid&s;t danger and death, &amp;c. Let us attend for a moment to the number of the witne&s;&s;es&mdash;Our Lord appeared to men and wo|men, to the eleven Apo&s;tles at &s;undry times; he a&s;cended in the pre&s;ence of an hundred and twen|ty, and St. Paul a&s;&s;ures us that he was &s;een of more than five hundred brethren at once, the greater part of whom were alive when he wrote to the Corinthians, and who of cour&s;e would have contradicted his account if it had not been true<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Corinthians 15. 6.</NOTE>.&mdash;Now though it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that a <HI>&s;ingle per&s;on</HI> &s;hould be deceived with re&s;pect to a fact which was an object of &s;en&s;e, it is alto|gether incredible that &s;o large a number &s;hould have been impo&s;ed upon. Can any per&s;on be &s;o &s;ceptical as to &s;uppo&s;e that not one of the Apo&s;tles, not one of the hundred and twenty, or of the five hundred could tell what he &s;aw, and heard and felt? It is not to be admitted that &s;o many per&s;ons would unite in reporting a fal&s;hood, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of any ad|vantage If the apo&s;tles had de&s;igned to im|po&s;e a fal&s;hood upon the world, they would ne|ver have communicated the affair to &s;o large a number, le&s;t amid&s;t &s;uch a variety of di&s;po&s;iti|ons, &s;ome &s;hould have di&s;covered the cheat. They mu&s;t have recollected that of the &s;mall number of twelve, one had proved a traitor, and that among &s;o many as five or &s;ix hundred, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible that all &s;hould prove true to their tru&s;t. Had they been impo&s;tors, this ve|ry
<PB N="13" REF="021142_0012_0FB253C939F032F8">circum&s;tance would infallibly have ruined their cau&s;e. No rational account can be given of the number of witne&s;&s;es but upon the idea that they were con&s;cious of their integrity, and knew the truth of the fact to which they bore te&s;timony.</P>
<P>As the&s;e witne&s;&s;es were abundantly &s;ufficient in number, to a&s;certain the truth of any fact which fell within their cognizance, &s;o their cha|racter was &s;uch as to render their te&s;timony highly credible.</P>
<P>They were per&s;ons of a fair, unblemi&s;hed cha|racter, and therefore could not wi&s;h to deceive mankind in their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts. Their writings plainly di&s;cover their piety to|wards God, as well as their benevolence to men. Con&s;cious of their integrity, they appeal to the omni&s;cient God for the truth of what they deli|vered to the world. We do not find any charge of immorality or wickedne&s;s brought again&s;t them by their mo&s;t inveterate enemies. If they had been per&s;ons of abandoned characters, the Jewi&s;h rulers would not have failed to have brought them to ju&s;tice; but when they cited them before their tribunal, they accu&s;ed them of nothing but preaching Je&s;us and the re&s;urrec|tion. So that malice it&s;elf can hardly indulge a &s;u&s;picion that they were liable to any im|peachment. It cannot therefore be admitted, that they would ever have wi&s;hed to per&s;uade the world that Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed, unle&s;s they knew the truth of the fact.&mdash;Further, they ap|pear in the whole of their conduct to have been
<PB N="14" REF="021142_0013_0FB253D21C0B6D98">per&s;ons of great plainne&s;s and &s;implicity. They were altogether unqualified to impo&s;e a fal&s;hood upon the world, had they been wicked enough to have attempted it. "They had neither gifts of nature, nor advantages of education to lead a multitude, and to manage the pa&s;&s;ions of men." There is no appearance of art or addre&s;s in their te&s;timony, but they declare in the mo&s;t &s;imple, unaffected manner tho&s;e things which they had &s;een and heard. They do not even attempt to conceal their own faults, but menti|on with the utmo&s;t frankne&s;s their dullne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, their incredulity, their doubts and fears. They relate without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, the perfidy of Judas, the denial of Peter, and their total dereliction of their ma&s;ter in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e are certain marks of fairne&s;s and impartiality, and &s;erve to recommend their te&s;timony to the belief of all men. However, though they had a large &s;hare of &s;implicity, yet they were not &s;uch weak and deluded mortals as &s;ome have repre&s;ented, &s;o as not to be certain of what they &s;aw and heard. There is no appear|ance of wild enthu&s;ia&s;m, or an overheated imagi|nation. There was nothing in their conduct which looked like fond credulity. They were extremely &s;low in admitting the truth of a fact, of which they had not the lea&s;t expectation. They enquired with care and attention as to the reality of it, and never publi&s;hed it to the world till they had the fulle&s;t ocular demon&s;tration. The incredulity of Thomas was carried to the greate&s;t exce&s;s, and was at length removed by the mo&s;t invincible evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="021142_0014_0FB253D46BA278A0">
Though they were illiterate men, yet they were as capable as others, of judging of a plain mat|ter of fact. By their former intimacy with Je|&s;us they could di&s;tingui&s;h him from any other per&s;on.&mdash;When they &s;aw him eat and drink be|fore them, when they handled his body, and freely conver&s;ed with him for forty days, they mu&s;t have been infallibly certain with re&s;pect to the identity of his per&s;on &mdash; So that on the whole, they could not have been impo&s;ed upon them|&s;elves, neither had they ability or di&s;po&s;ition to impole upon others.</P>
<P>We are further to con&s;ider their &s;tedfa&s;t adhe|rence to their declaration amid&s;t danger and death. Soon after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, his apo&s;tles publi&s;hed his religion in the city of Je|ru&s;alem. They cea&s;ed not to declare the inno|cency of their ma&s;ter, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ldly charged his death upon the prie&s;ts and rulers as a mo&s;t inhu|man murder, No threateings were &s;ufficient to intimidate them. James one of the twelve, and Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the holy Gho&s;t, &s;oon fell &s;acrifices to the rage of per&s;ecu|tion. Peter, one of the chief of the apo&s;tles, was committed to pri&s;on and the time fixed for his execution. The re&s;t, neverthele&s;s per&s;evered in their declaration, and cea&s;ed not to preach Je|&s;us and the re&s;urrection. While they were ex|po&s;ed to every kind of indignity and contempt, from an unbelieving world, and death it&s;elf in the mo&s;t tremendous forms, they never he&s;itated with re&s;pect to their te&s;timony.

Now though the &s;ufferings of the apo&s;tles do not immediately prove the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, yet they are a good evidence of the &s;incerity of their decla|ration. There have indeed been in&s;tances where per&s;ons have &s;uffered cather than relinqui&s;h fal&s;e and erroneous opinions. But the ca&s;e is widely different where men die for the truth of a matter of fact which they had &s;een them&s;elves. "In doctrines, as Bi&s;hop Sherlock ob&s;erves, men are always liable to mi&s;take, and it is no rea&s;on for me to embrace another man's opinion becau&s;e I think him &s;incere in it. But when a man reports to me an uncommon matter of fact, which is in its own nature an object of &s;en&s;e, if I believe him not, it is not becau&s;e I doubt the te&s;timony of his &s;en&s;es, but merely becau&s;e I que&s;tion his truth and &s;incerity. Since voluntary &s;uffering for the truth is a good proof of &s;incerity, the &s;uffering of the apo&s;tles for the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, is a powerful argument in &s;upport of the reality of it. The apo&s;tles gave up their lives in bear|ing te&s;timony to the re&s;urrection of their ma&s;ter. It was always in their power to quit their evidence and &s;ave their lives. Even their bittere&s;t ene|mies required them only to be &s;ilent. Others have denied or a&s;&s;erted facts in hopes of &s;aving their lives: but the&s;e men atte&s;t a fact at the ex|pence of <HI>their</HI> lives which they might have &s;aved by denying the truth. So that between crimi|nals denying plain facts, and the apo&s;tles dying for their te&s;timony there is this material difference.

<P>Once more, the gifts of the holy Gho&s;t which were imparted to the apo&s;tles and others, are a &s;ub&s;tantial proof of our Lord's re&s;urrection. He a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hould receive power to execute the work a&s;&s;igned them, that the holy Gho&s;t &s;hould come upon them, and that they &s;hould be his witne&s;&s;es both in Jeru&s;alem and in all Judea, and to the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 1. 8.</NOTE>. The &s;acred hi&s;torian a&s;&s;ures us that this promi&s;e was fulfilled on the memorable day of Penteco&s;t, when they received the gift of tongues and other miraculous powers nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the truth of their mi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e powers began to be ex|erci&s;ed at a publick fe&s;tival in Jeru&s;alem, in the pre&s;ence of a va&s;t multitude collected from all quarters. So that if the&s;e had not been real mi|racles, there was every po&s;&s;ible advantage for de|tection. Now as God him&s;elf bore them witne&s;s with divers &s;igns and miracles and gifts of the holy Gho&s;t, their declaration was entitled to the fulle&s;t credit. The apo&s;tle in our text refers to the&s;e miraculous gifts when he &s;ays that Chri&s;t was declared to be the &s;on of God with power <HI>according to the &s;pirit of holine&s;s, or the holy &s;pirit.</HI> For though the&s;e miraculous powers did not di|rectly prove the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, yet as they were agreeable to his own prediction, and be&s;tow|ed at the very time which he had pre&s;cribed, as they were vi&s;ible manife&s;tations of the power of

But as the laws of nature are the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of the divine go|vernment, and e&s;&s;ential to the order and happi|ne&s;s of the world, it cannot be rationally &s;uppo&s;|ed that God ever delegates to his creatures a pow|er of controuling tho&s;e laws at their own plea&s;ure. It is altogether inadmi&s;&s;ible that oppo&s;ite beings &s;hould in turn &s;u&s;pend the laws of nature, in or|der to &s;upport different &s;y&s;tems. "This would entirely de&s;troy the credit of miracles as criterions of truth, and credentials of a divine mi&s;&s;ion. A God of truth can never bear an immediate te&s;ti|mony to one as a divine me&s;&s;enger whom he has not &s;ent, or who publi&s;hes his own inventions as the oracles of heaven." He cannot con&s;i&s;tently with his wi&s;dom and benevolence, ever &s;uffer any inferior beings by miraculous works to deceive his creatures. It mu&s;t be added, that the rapid &s;pread and propagation of the go&s;pel in the world, again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices and the mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ition, &s;erve to confirm the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection. The doctrines and precepts of chri&s;tianity were totally oppo&s;ite to the principles and views of Jews and Gentiles. All parties were confederated again&s;t it, though upon different motives; and yet it &s;pread and triumphed. Within twenty five years after the death of Chri&s;t many myriads of Jews believed in him; and in a few years after, the go&s;pel was propagated through all parts of the Roman em|pire; and thus agreeably to our Lord's predic|tion,

Did he not promi&s;e his votaries a paradi&s;e which &s;hould give full &s;cope to their unbridled appetites and inclinations?&mdash;The religion and example of Je&s;us were totally oppo&s;ite to this &s;y&s;tem. Chri&s;tianity is levelled again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men. It inculcates every virtue which can adorn human nature, and a&s;&s;imilate it to the pat|tern of perfection.

<P>The Jewi&s;h rulers alarmed at the idea of his re&s;urrection and the probable con&s;equences of it, immediately took mea&s;ures to prevent the belief of this important fact. They hired the &s;oldiers to declare that the body was &s;tolen away by the di&s;ciples while they &s;lept. This report, however improbable, has been believed by the Jews in all ages of the chri&s;tian Church No &s;tory was ever fabricated more ab&s;urd in it&s;elf. For men can
<PB N="21" REF="021142_0020_0FB253FE26CFF578">never &s;ay what is done while they are a&s;leep. If the di&s;ciples had attempted to take away the bo|dy, and the guard knew it, they might with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, have prevented it. If the body was taken away while they were a&s;leep, it was impo&s;|&s;ible for them to &s;ay by whom it was done. Suppo&s;ing they had been &s;o regardle&s;s of their duty as to have fallen a&s;leep, any attempt to rob the &s;epulchre mu&s;t in&s;tantly have awaked them. The body was &s;o depo&s;ited that its removal could not be effected without con&s;iderable noi&s;e. Be|&s;ides, the Evangeli&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, that the burying clothes were left in &s;uch order that there was no appearance of hurry and confu&s;ion, but all the marks of lei&s;ure and compo&s;ure of mind.&mdash;It is extremely improbable that the di&s;ciples of our Lord &s;hould have attemped any thing of this kind. It does not appear that they had any ex|pectation of his ri&s;ing again. When he was laid in the tomb, all their hopes of his being the pro|mi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, were buried with him. It is therefore inconceivable that they &s;hould have con|trived any account with re&s;pect to his re&s;urrecti|on. By &s;tealing the body, they would have been guilty of a high offence, and liable to a heavy puni&s;hment, without the lea&s;t expectation of &s;up|port either from God or men in a&s;&s;erting the re|&s;urrection, which on this &s;uppo&s;ition, they knew to be fal&s;e. Be&s;ides, if the Jewi&s;h rulers had believed this &s;tory them&s;elves, and knew that there had been any collu&s;ion with re&s;pect to the removal of the body, why was there no attempt to confront and de&s;troy the te&s;timony of the apo&s;tles? This would certainly have been an act

<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that men in the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;hould never have attempted any inve&s;tigation of the matter? Is not their &s;ilence a &s;trong pre|&s;umptive proof that they knew the reality of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection?</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been &s;ugge&s;ted by way of objection, that according to the account of the Evangeli&s;ts, Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed before the time fixed in the prediction. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the words <HI>meta treis &ecirc;meras,</HI> after three days do not &s;ignify either in the nature of the thing, or in con&s;tant acceptation, the completion of three times twen|ty four hours. It is evident that the Scribes and Phari&s;ees under&s;tood by the third day only the commencement of that day. They demand|ed that a watch &s;hould be &s;et till the third day, which plainly &s;hews that had Chri&s;t ri&s;en on any part of that day to their conviction, they mu&s;t have owned the accompli&s;hment of the prophecy. Our Lord was crucified and laid in the tomb on Friday; he continued there all Saturday, and early in the morning on what is now called the fir&s;t day of the week, he aro&s;e; which according to Jewi&s;h phra&s;eology, was <HI>three days</HI> and <HI>three nights.</HI> We have a &s;imilar in&s;tance of computa|tion in 1 Kings 12. 5. where Rehoboam &s;ays to the people, depart yet for three days and then come again, and yet all the people came to him the third day. In like manner, when the parents of Je&s;us mi&s;&s;ed him on their return from Jeru&s;a|lem, it is &s;aid that they went back, and after three days, found him in the temple, i. e. the
<PB N="23" REF="021142_0022_0FB25409AF784860">third day. For they mi&s;&s;ed him after the fir&s;t day's journey, returned the &s;econd day to the ci|ty, and on the third day they found him in the temple. Jo&s;ephus, the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian, has a &s;imi|lar expre&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to I&s;aac, <HI>on eutheus met ogdocen &ecirc;meran peritemnou&s;i,</HI> i. e. the eighth day. So that the expre&s;&s;ion in the prophecy exactly agrees with the event, when taken according to the u&s;e of language at that time.</P>
<P>The la&s;t objection which I &s;hall notice, is that which is derived from our Lord's not appearing to the body of the Jewi&s;h nation. Infidels &s;ay, that he promi&s;ed &s;uch an appearance, when he declared that no &s;ign &s;hould be given, but the &s;ign of the prophet Jonas; and that as Jonas was a &s;ign to the Ninevites, &s;o &s;hould the &s;on of man be to that generation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 11. 29, 30.</NOTE>. In reply to this it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the prophecy never inti|mated that he &s;hould ri&s;e in the pre&s;ence of the people or &s;hew him&s;elf to the body of them, but only that &s;ufficient and proper evidence &s;hould be exhibited of the truth of his re&s;urrection. Jo|nas was a &s;ign to the Ninevites, becau&s;e they had proper evidence of his miraculous deliverance, though none of them perhaps &s;aw him when he was thrown out of the fi&s;h. The prophecy of Chri&s;t was al&s;o literally and exactly fulfilled when the truth of his re&s;urrection was atte&s;ted by credible witne&s;&s;es The body of the Jewi&s;h na|tion had no rea&s;on to expect that Chri&s;t would appear to them; for his particular commi&s;&s;ion to that people terminated at his death, and he
<PB N="24" REF="021142_0023_0FB2541256CFF358">a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hould &s;ee him no more till they were better di&s;po&s;ed to receive him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 13. 35.</NOTE>. As the whole world was concerned in the truth of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch proof &s;hould be exhibited as was adapted to the &s;atisfaction of all men. Who could be &s;o well qualified to be the witne&s;&s;es of this important fact, as tho&s;e who had been intimately conver|&s;ant with him, who knew his form and air, his voice and manner: If our Lord had appeared publickly to the Jews, it is probable that &s;ome of them would have been convinced; others would no doubt have per&s;i&s;ted in their infidelity; &s;o that future generations mu&s;t after all, have depended upon the evidence of tho&s;e very per|&s;ons who were appointed to be the witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection. In&s;tead of gaining any thing by his publick appearance, we mu&s;t have tru&s;ted to the evidence of the di&s;ciples, and this clogged with one incumbrance, viz. that &s;ome who &s;aw him were not convinced. If the body of the Jew|i&s;h nation had been convinced by &s;uch a publick appearance, this would not have been &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy modern infidels. They could have no other evidence of the fact than te&s;timo|ny, and therefore according to their own &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t continue in doubt. Per&s;ons of this charac|ter are not the more ready to admit the reality of the miracles of Mo&s;es in Egypt and at the Red &s;ea, becau&s;e they were wrought before all the people. If the te&s;timony of &s;everal hundreds of credible per&s;ons who had the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible opportunity for knowing the truth, and who were ready to
<PB N="25" REF="021142_0024_0FB25419822D4428">&s;eal their declaration with their blood, is not ad|mitted, there is no probability that an augmen|tation of their number to any amount what&s;oever, would afford conviction. "If they hear not Mo&s;es and the Prophets," Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, there is no probability that they would be per|&s;uaded, "though one ro&s;e from the dead" and appeared per&s;onally to every individual.&mdash;The time will not admit of enlarging any further, I will relieve your patience by concluding with &s;ome re|marks on the doctrine which has been con&s;idered.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t has been <HI>declared to be the &s;on of God with power by</HI> his re&s;urrection from the dead, then we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that the chri&s;tian religi|on is of divine original. It is evident that "we have not followed cunningly&mdash;devi&s;ed fables, and that our faith &s;tands not in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God." For &s;urely the almighty and benevolent Father of all, would never have thus honoured an impo&s;tor and have given credit to his impious undertaking. This is the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible atte&s;tation which could ever be given to any me&s;&s;enger from heaven. So that he who doubts the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t either believe that it is within the reach of human power to rai&s;e the dead, or el&s;e that a being of all perfection has adopted the mo&s;t effectual method to lead mankind into er|ror and delu&s;ion. The re&s;urrection of Je&s;us is at once a &s;triking in&s;tance of two of the be&s;t kinds of evidence in &s;upport of revelation; I mean miracles and prophecies. This was it&s;elf an illu&s;trious miracle, far exceeding the limits of created power. It was al&s;o an exact fulfilment
<PB N="26" REF="021142_0025_0FB254200FFB7DE0">of expre&s;s predictions delivered by preceding prophets and by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. If therefore the proof of this fact is &s;atisfactory to our minds, we cannot for a moment doubt the truth of the go&s;pel revelation; and if we admit this, the writings of Mo&s;es and the Prophets cannot be di&s;credited, becau&s;e they all refer ultimately to Chri&s;t, and were completely accompli&s;hed in him. The old and new Te&s;taments are clo&s;ely and in|&s;eperably connected, and mu&s;t &s;tand or fall toge|ther.&mdash;Again, it follows, that while infidels are con&s;tantly charging Chri&s;tians with fond credu|lity, they them&s;elves have an uncommon &s;hare of it. For &s;ince the Chri&s;tian religion has been propagated and &s;till exi&s;ts in the world, upon their principles they mu&s;t admit, that a few poor illiterate fi&s;hermen were able to contend with the prejudices of all the world, the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, the intere&s;ts of the prie&s;ts, the pride of the philo&s;ophers, the malice of the Jews, the learning of Greece and the power of Rome. They mu&s;t believe al&s;o, that a number of the vile&s;t impo&s;tors that ever appeared in this world, have publi&s;hed the mo&s;t excellent &s;y&s;tem of mo|rality which mankind was ever favoured with. They will be compelled to own, that the&s;e men &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t grievous &s;ufferings, and to death it&s;elf, in vindication of what they knew to be fal&s;e, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of any reward what&s;oever. The&s;e and &s;undry other things which might be mentioned, which undeniably follow from their principles, are totally oppo&s;ite to the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of nature, and are facts as miraculous as any recorded in the New Te&s;ta|ment. Further, it follows that the prevalence
<PB N="27" REF="021142_0026_0FB2542114AF4DA8">of infidelity is not owing to the want of evidence of the truth of our holy religion, but to &s;ome other cau&s;es. Under the continuance and progre&s;s of chri&s;tianity, its evidence has been growing and gathering &s;trength. The more thoroughly this &s;y&s;tem has been canva&s;&s;ed, with the brighter lu&s;|tre does its evidence appear. 'The continual acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength from the exact accompli&s;h|ment of prophecies, of which in many in&s;tances, we have ocular demon&s;tration, is an overbalance for any &s;uppo&s;ed diminution, with re&s;pect to the proof ari&s;ing from miracles. The want of the te&s;ti|mony of our &s;en&s;es which the apo&s;tles and primi|tive chri&s;tians had, is &s;upplied by an increa&s;e of evidence of another kind, in the &s;ame manner (if the &s;imilitude may be admitted,) that the lo&s;s of luminous matter from the &s;un is &s;upplied by a communication of light from the fixed &s;tars; or as other &s;uppo&s;e, by ab&s;orbing comets into it. The wi&s;dom and contrivance of divine provi|dence being no le&s;s admirable in the moral, than the natural world; no le&s;s in the light which God gives us from and concerning the &s;un of righte|ne&s;s, than in the &s;upply of that of the &s;un in the firmament.'</P>
<P>Dei&s;m oftentimes re&s;ults from the pride of the human heart. Men who have a high &s;en&s;e of their own abilities and philo&s;ophical knowledge, are not willing to admit the truth of revelation, becau&s;e there are &s;ome things in it above hu|man inve&s;tigation. They forget that natural re|ligion is liable to the &s;ame objection; and that philo&s;ophy it&s;ef, &s;o far as it relates to the ab&s;tract natures of things, is a &s;cience full of arcana, which the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of genius has hitherto been
<PB N="28" REF="021142_0027_0FB25423F57D6BA0">unable to di&s;clo&s;e.

<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, that an affectation of cou|rage may in &s;ome in&s;tances, have betrayed men into infidelity. Some flatter them&s;elves that it is a &s;ure indication of courage to call in que&s;tion that which the world holds &s;acred. A late au|thor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Hurd.</NOTE> remarks, that when the philo&s;opher of Malm&s;bury in the la&s;t century, re&s;olved all morality and religion into the will of the magi&s;|trate, the bold &s;ingularity of the paradox was, no doubt, that which chiefly recommended it to him&s;elf, as well as &s;urprized the world into an opi|nion of his bravery; though we know from his &s;tory that he had no more of this virtue, than might have con&s;i&s;ted with faith and the fear of God. But vain man, &s;ays he, oft affects to make a &s;hew of that which he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and thus his defect in true courage, may be the rea&s;on why he pretends to &s;o much of it.</P>
<P>It will hardly be thought a breach of charity to &s;uppo&s;e, that many have rejected revelation on account of its oppo&s;ition to their favorite vices: or in the language of our Savior, "that they love darkne&s;s rather than light becau&s;e their deeds are evil."</P>
<P>Immer&s;ed in worldly pur&s;uits and &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures, men cannot endure the holy precepts of the New Te&s;tament. They &s;ecretly wi&s;h that there
<PB N="29" REF="021142_0028_0FB2542633206100">was not &s;ufficient evidence to &s;upport this &s;y&s;tem. When they come enqtire, &s;mall objections thro' the force of prejudice, appear to them in&s;upera|ble, and they are ea&s;ily prevailed on to reject the go&s;pel. If they would with hone&s;t, imparti|al minds con&s;ider the nature and de&s;ign of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, and the evidence of the facts recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, they would pre&s;ently be &s;atisfied of its truth. If they were &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to practi&s;e the du|ties of natural religion, the go&s;pel would appear to them "worthy of all acceptation."</P>
<P>This literary &s;ociety, founded by the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, has under the &s;miles of heaven been happily in&s;tumental of promoting the knowledge and belief of chri&s;tianity in our land. Many of its &s;ons have ri&s;en to di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence and u&s;efulne&s;s in church and &s;tate, and their names will be tran&s;mitted with honor to the late&s;t generations. May a noble emula|tion be excited in the brea&s;ts of the &s;tudents in this univer&s;ity to exceed all who have gone be|fore them in intellectual and moral attainments. The di&s;tingui&s;hing advantages which you now enjoy, the expectations of your friends and your country, as well as your pre&s;ent peace and future happine&s;s, all urge you to vigorous pur&s;uit and unremitting application. While you ad|vance in the delightful paths of &s;cience, and &s;ur|vey the wonders which modern philo&s;ophy opens to your view, ever carry your thought up to the fir&s;t cau&s;e, the original &s;ource of exi&s;tence. Sen|&s;ible of the weakne&s;s and imperfections of the human mind, and of the doubt and uncertainty of the be&s;t heathen philo&s;ophers with re&s;pect to religious truths, receive the go&s;pel revelation
<PB N="30" REF="021142_0029_0FB25427A8B06D78">with gratitude and joy. Examire its evidence with candor and impartiality. Be not &s;haken in mind either by the &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;onings or the pro|fane banter of men of depraved hearts. Never indulge an idea that it is an argument of weak|ne&s;s or fond credulity to admit the truth of reve|lation. Many of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed philo|&s;ophers which the world ever produced, have been firm believers in the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and have done them&s;elves immortal honor by their writings in &s;upport of it, and their dying te&s;ti|mony to it. Let all your &s;earches after truth be ac|companied with a temper and practice conforma|ble to the eternal and immutable rules of rea&s;on and religion. May you be trained up for emi|nent &s;ervice among the multitude of your bre|thren, and finally be qualified for that &s;tate where every thing whith is my&s;terious and unin|telligible &s;hall be cleared up, and the whole in|tellectual world be open to your view.</P>
<P>Finally, with what unfeigned gratitude &s;hould we all "ble&s;s the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who by his re&s;urrection from the dead, has begotten us to the lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Since "Chri&s;t is ri&s;en as the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept," we cannot doubt the truth and certainty of our own re&s;urrection. This is a noble di&s;covery of revelation. May we be rai&s;ed in our de&s;ires and pur&s;uits above all the vanities of this tran&s;itory life, and be "look|ing for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious ap|pearance of the great God and our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
