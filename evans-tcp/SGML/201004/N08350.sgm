<HEAD>THE CONDUCT OF THE Late Admini&s;tration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE reader will &s;ee in the motto prefixed to this tract, the rea&s;ons for undertaking it: the &s;tate of the common-wealth is &s;uch, whether we con&s;ider the debt, the factions, and the venality of the kingdom; or the little pro&s;pect there is of finding <HI>another mini&s;ter</HI> who will oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the two latter, for the &s;ake of alleviating the former; that it can no longer &s;up|port our vices; tho' it has &s;till perhaps &s;trength &s;uffi|cient to bear an application of the proper remedies. But the&s;e remedies cannot be hoped for 'till our for|mer conduct, the motives, and the effects of it are ge|nerally under&s;tood. A per&s;ua&s;ion that if the&s;e were fairly laid before the public, our opinions, and con&s;e|quently our mea&s;ures would be altered; and that it is not even yet too late to retrieve, in &s;ome degree, the lo&s;&s;es which the &s;tate has &s;u&s;tained while her intere&s;ts have been neglected and &s;acrificed, was the motive which produced this publication: a motive which, if it does not give &s;ucce&s;s to the de&s;ign, will, it is hoped, carry with it an excu&s;e for the attempt. For although per&s;onal altercations and private feuds have degraded the tribunal of the <HI>public,</HI> the attention of which they
<PB N="4" REF="010663_0003_0F81E025144DAD78">have &s;o long engro&s;&s;ed; yet the que&s;tions which are peculiarly proper for its cognizance, are tho&s;e which concern the <HI>honor,</HI> the <HI>wealth,</HI> or the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of the com|munity; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e plans of <HI>foreign</HI> and <HI>do|me&s;tic policy,</HI> which are pur&s;ued by tho&s;e to whom the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate are entru&s;ted: no introducti|on therefore or apology is nece&s;&s;ary to a tract, which propo&s;es to enquire into the merit of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have lately been adopted by the late <HI>mini&s;try,</HI> with regard to points of the greate&s;t importance to the empire, commerce and &s;ecurity of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It were ever to be wi&s;hed that enquiries of this &s;ort could be made without de&s;cending to per&s;onal accu&s;a|tions; for the &s;ubjects are much le&s;&s;ened when the reputations of particular men, the prai&s;e or cen&s;ure of &s;ome <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> becomes a con&s;iderable part of them. But on this occa&s;ion, it is feared that this re&s;erve is impo&s;&s;ible; when we judge of the merits of mea&s;ures, we nece&s;&s;arily judge of tho&s;e by whom they were planned and executed. If, however, in the cour&s;e of the enquiry blame &s;hall be thrown on particular per|&s;ons, the writer can truly &s;ay, that this was not in his fir&s;t intention, and that it is only the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the &s;ubject he treats; a &s;ubject of &s;o much impor|tance, that he has not &s;uffered the di&s;like which he feels in common with almo&s;t all mankind to per&s;onal cen&s;ure, to &s;tifle that information which the public has a right to receive upon a point which goes up to the very fir&s;t principles of our con&s;titution, and involves in it que&s;tions upon which the exi&s;tence of all govern|ment depends. The reader ea&s;ily &s;ees that the &s;ub|ject I mean is the <HI>&s;tamp act.</HI> This is the mea&s;ure of the greate&s;t importance, both in it&s;elf and in its con|&s;equences: referring therefore the other plans of the year to &s;ome future hour, it is propo&s;ed at pre&s;ent to <HI>examine the conduct of the mini&s;try,</HI> with regard to this
<PB N="5" REF="010663_0004_0F81E025E483C740"><HI>act,</HI> from the time at which they came into office, to that at which it was repealed.</P>
<P>If this is done without partiality, the per&s;ons who&s;e conduct is examined will have no rea&s;on to complain; they e&s;pecially will have no rea&s;on to complain of be|ing called to a public trial, who are perpetually a&s;&s;uring us that their delight, their merit, and their &s;upport is, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s entirely the favour of the public. To di&s;prove the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>nec enim</HI> (to u&s;e the words of Cicero) <HI>populum romanum e&s;&s;e illum puto, qui con&s;tat ex iis qui mercede conducuntur, qui impelluntur ut vim afferant magi&s;tratibus, ut ob&s;ideant &s;enatum;</HI> and to &s;hew by what arts they gained, for a &s;hort time, the appearance of popularity, would be ea&s;y; but it is of little con&s;equence in it&s;elf, and fo|reign to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which will however determine (which is a que&s;tion of more importance) whether they have de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>To decide on the merits of their conduct, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the <HI>&s;tate of affairs</HI> &s;hould be known; that the <HI>intelligence</HI> received from America, the <HI>mode</HI> and the <HI>degree</HI> of the <HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> there made, <HI>the wi&s;hes of our friends, the efforts of the oppo&s;ers, the conduct of our officers,</HI> &s;hould be &s;tated; e&s;pecially that the <HI>in|&s;tructions</HI> &s;ent by the <HI>mini&s;try</HI> in con&s;equence of the informations they had received &s;hould be examined. Upon the&s;e grounds this enquiry is conducted; when|ever a fact is a&s;&s;erted, the authorities for it are quoted or referred to; authorities &s;o convincing as to leave no room for doubt; they con&s;i&s;t of <HI>letters, minutes of councils, in&s;tructions, advices, orders,</HI> tran&s;mitted to and from America. <HI>Tran&s;cripts</HI> of the&s;e are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o many per&s;ons, and the power of con&s;ulting them is in the reach of &s;o many more, that the reader will not &s;u&s;pect any fal&s;e quotation is at|tempted in circum&s;tances which render the detection
<PB N="6" REF="010663_0005_0F81E0265FF7DA68">of it &s;o very ea&s;y. Some of the&s;e are in&s;erted in the <HI>appendix;</HI> from others extracts only are made, with references in the notes to the letters them&s;elves, and credit is taken from the exactne&s;s of them upon the &s;ame ground; as well as for tho&s;e in which the names of the writers are omitted; the only rea&s;on of this o|mi&s;&s;ion is to avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of informing the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> (who, it is feared, do not want this information) by what channels the intelligence of their proceedings was conveyed to us; for, to the di&s;grace of Great Britain, her friends and advocates in one of her pro|vinces, are not (it &s;eems) to be protected or avowed. And &s;urely it is time that the public &s;hould receive <HI>the evidence</HI> which has hitherto been indu&s;triou&s;ly con|cealed from them, whil&s;t fal&s;e, though po&s;itive a&s;&s;er|tions, and unmeaning declamation have been &s;ub&s;titu|ted in its place: it is time, that having heard with eagerne&s;s and even with partiality the <HI>claims</HI> of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> they &s;hould hear with patience, at lea&s;t whil&s;t I plead, <HI>the cau&s;e of Great Britain;</HI> that they &s;hould read with impartiality, whil&s;t I &s;tate very &s;hortly, (not <HI>the merits,</HI> for they are be&s;ide the pre&s;ent que&s;|tion, but) <HI>the principles and progre&s;s of the &s;tamp-act:</HI> an act to which to private intere&s;ts, no party views, nothing but public motives could give ri&s;e; and <HI>the intentions</HI> of which, however they might be treated in <HI>America,</HI> de&s;erve the approbation of every inhabitant of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t and great principle of all government, and of all &s;ociety, is, that <HI>&s;upport is due in return for protection;</HI> that every &s;ubject &s;hould contribute to the common defence, in which his own is included. <HI>Nam neque quies gentium &s;ine armis, neque arma &s;ine &s;tipendiis, neque &s;tipendia &s;ine tributis haberi queunt.</HI> Tacit. Hi&s;t. lib. 4. It was nece&s;&s;ary, and it was ju&s;t, to recur to this principle at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war.
<PB N="7" REF="010663_0006_0F81E02798DC45E8">It was found <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to maintain upwards of 10000 men for the defence of our <HI>colonies;</HI> an expence of between 3 &amp; 400,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per ann.</HI> great part of which was entirely new, was, on that account, to be incur|red; it was <HI>ju&s;t</HI> that the <HI>colonies</HI> which had profited &s;o much by the war, who&s;e intere&s;ts, commerce and &s;e|curity had been the fir&s;t objects of <HI>the peace;</HI> and of who&s;e ability to bear at lea&s;t &s;ome proportion of that new expence there neither was nor is any rea&s;on to doubt, &s;hould contribute (not to &s;upport or to defend Great Britain but) <HI>about a third part of the expence</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for their own defence and protection.</P>
<P>Upon this general and acknowledged principle, and upon this application of it, which was ju&s;t in it&s;elf, and which the &s;ituation of this country made nece&s;&s;a|ry, and which it might have been expected, would ap|pear neither unrea&s;onable or unplea&s;ing to an Engli&s;h ear, <HI>the &s;tamp act was planned.</HI> In the beginning of the year 1764 the propo&s;ition of impo&s;ing, by a duty on &s;tamps, <HI>a tax on America,</HI> in conformity to unin|terrupted precedents for near 100 years, was made, and thrown into the form of <HI>re&s;olution.</HI> At that time the merits of this que&s;tion were opened at large; tho&s;e who have lately &s;o loudly a&s;&s;erted the <HI>privileges</HI> and <HI>exemptions</HI> of America were then publicly called upon to deny, if they thought it fitting, the right of the le|gi&s;lature to impo&s;e any tax either internal or external upon that country: and not a &s;ingle per&s;on ventured to controvert that right. A year's delay however was given, that any information might be received from <HI>America,</HI> with regard to the <HI>expediency</HI> of the parti|cular tax propo&s;ed, not to permit the right of impo&s;ing it to be controverted. This di&s;tinction was fully opened at that time, and afterwards explained to the <HI>agents</HI> of the <HI>provinces.</HI></P>
<P>This delay was however abu&s;ed by &s;ome of the
<PB N="8" REF="010663_0007_0F81E02859D16BB8"><HI>Americans;</HI> and when, in the beginning of the year 1765, the plan was carried into execution by a bill &s;everal <HI>petitions</HI> from <HI>America</HI> which <HI>denied their right of impo&s;ing taxes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">,</HI> were pre&s;ented to the <HI>parliament,</HI> and were therefore <HI>rejected without a divi&s;ion; no one per&s;on</HI> having been then found, in either hou&s;e, who would declare it to be his opinion that America was not, in this in&s;tance, &s;ubject to Great-Britain
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>And yet it has been a&s;&s;erted that this oppo&s;ition would have been made, if &s;ome intelligence relating to this matter had not been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed at that time; as this was publicly &s;aid, the public is to be informed of the fact, which was this.</P>
<P>On the 11th of December, 1764, the board of trade re|ported to the king, that the a&s;&s;emblies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's bay and New-York had, <HI>in their re&s;olutions and proceedings</HI> (co|pies of which they tran&s;mitted with the report) <HI>treated the acts and re&s;olutions of the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain with the mo&s;t indecent di&s;re&s;pect.</HI> The privy council advi&s;ed the king, <HI>to give directions that the &s;ame be laid before parliament, at &s;uch time and in &s;uch manner as his Maje&s;ty &s;hall be plea&s;ed to direct and appoint.</HI></P>
<P>This po&s;tponed the laying it before parliament, as it was meant to do; but it deprived the parliament of no informa|tion, for the a&s;&s;emblies had in&s;tructed their agents here to prepare petitions in the &s;ame words; and particularly Mr. Mauduit, the agent for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's bay, was directed to draw his principles and arguments from Mr. Otis's book of The Rights of the Colonies (which had been reprinted here). The colonies were obeyed. Petitions were pre|&s;ented, a&s;&s;erting the right of freedom from taxes impo&s;ed by Great-Britain, on the very grounds of the re&s;olutions and proceedings which the board of trade had tran&s;mitted to the king; the&s;e were rejected by parliament, not from ig|norance of their contents, but becau&s;e their contents were known; becau&s;e they denied the power of Great-Britain. No information was with-held therefore by this delay, the cau&s;e of which was tenderne&s;s to the colonies. For had the king called the attention of parliament to proceedings in which their acts were treated with the mo&s;t <HI>indecent di&s;re|&s;pect;</HI> their own d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnity mu&s;t have drawn from them vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; of cen&s;ure and &s;everity towards the offenders: and there|fore the mini&s;try, who were taking the proper methods to form and enforce the act, which would have &s;ufficiently re|pre&s;&s;ed the claims of the Americans, and effectually a&s;&s;erted the dignity and authority of Great-Britain, withheld a paper which would have given no information but what was given in a manner le&s;s calculated to irritate mens min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P></NOTE> In 1766 <HI>the act</HI> was repealed, but even
<PB N="9" REF="010663_0008_0F81E028CC31DF38">then <HI>the admini&s;tration,</HI> determined as they were on the repeal, and though they were to carry their point chiefly by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentleman</HI>'s &s;peeches who denied the <HI>right of England</HI> to tax the colonies, were however obliged, before they ventured to pro|po&s;e this mea&s;ure to parliament, to prepare the way by <HI>a bill a&s;&s;erting the right</HI> in the fulle&s;t &amp; &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>So that however the public may have been mi&s;led by the authority of <HI>names</HI> quoted on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, it can be doubted of no longer; <HI>the &s;upreme legi&s;lature</HI> has a&s;&s;erted, in the mo&s;t explicit and &s;olemn manner, its <HI>right</HI> to the obedience of its American &s;ubjects; and therefore the a&s;&s;ertions of <HI>particular per&s;ons,</HI> oppo&s;ed to this, not only de&s;erve that di&s;regard which they will meet, who propagate opinions contrary to the common declared &s;en&s;e, and detrimental to the intere&s;ts of their country, but be|come al&s;o highly criminal: for it is now as criminal to a&s;&s;ert <HI>the exemption of America from taxes impo&s;ed by parliament,</HI> as it is to a&s;&s;ert, that parliament had no right to repeal the &s;tamp act.</P>
<P>The right of Great-Britain being e&s;tabli&s;hed and univer&s;ally acknowledged (except by about &s;ix or &s;even voices) it is certain, that whatever the private opinions of particular men might be, it was the duty of every &s;ubject to have &s;ubmitted to this law while it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and the duty of tho&s;e to whom the execution of it was committed, to have enforced it.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep therefore is to enquire whether <HI>the admini&s;tration</HI> took the mea&s;ures proper and nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="10" REF="010663_0009_0F81E029633F4508">to procure due obedience to a law in which the inte|re&s;ts and dignity of Great-Britain were &s;o deeply con|cerned; or whether they are guilty of having, by neglect and connivance, encouraged a re&s;i&s;tance to her authority, and &s;haked the very foundations of her empire.</P>
<P>To judge of this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine the in|&s;tructions and orders i&s;&s;ued by the &s;&mdash;y of &s;t&mdash;e for the &s;outhern department, to whom this important branch of our dominions is officially entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The letters of Mr. &s;&mdash;y C&mdash;y are of three dates; they are <HI>reprinted</HI> here, having been already printed in America. The fir&s;t of them is <HI>a &s;ingle letter</HI> to <HI>governor Fauquier,</HI> dated Sept. 14, 1765
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 1.</NOTE>. On the 24th of October, 1765, the &s;&mdash;y wrote to major general Gage
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 2.</NOTE>, to governor Bernard
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 3.</NOTE>, and a cir|cular letter to the governors of the colonies
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 4.</NOTE>; and on the 15th of December, 1765, he &s;ent letters to major general Gage
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Appen|dix, No. 5.</NOTE>, and to lieutenant governor Colden
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 6.</NOTE>. Of this la&s;t an extract only is given, the re&s;t is omit|ted, as it contains a cen&s;ure on a particular per&s;on.</P>
<P>The reader will ju&s;tly be &s;urpri&s;ed, that on a &s;ub|ject &s;o important, at a time &s;o critical, no more directi|ons were i&s;&s;ued; he will be more &s;o, to find that the letter to governor Bernard, of the fir&s;t date, and that of the la&s;t, to general Gage, refer to tho&s;e of the 24th of October, 1765 for in&s;tructions, (the letter to go|vernor Colden is on a particular &s;ubject only) that the letter of the 24th of October, 1765, though addre&s;&s;ed to &s;o many different <HI>governors,</HI> pre&s;iding over people &s;o different in their <HI>form of government, character</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> is the &s;ame to each; and indeed a mere <HI>fac+&s;imile</HI> of that &s;ent to the <HI>commander in chief of the Engli&s;h forces;</HI> that in fact only <HI>one in&s;truction</HI> was
<PB N="11" REF="010663_0010_0F81E02A5044AC40">i&s;&s;ued during that period, and that from all his <HI>e&s;&s;ays on obedience,</HI> it would be difficult to extract any thing which could give real directions or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the governors, who&s;e conduct was to determine, whether the empire of North America &s;hould be retained in obedience, or thrown into an independence fatal to them&s;elves and dangerous to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of per&s;picuity and of ju&s;tice, the me|thod ob&s;erved is this, before each letter is con&s;idered, the information which the writer of it had then re|ceived is &s;tated; for it is only by thus placing our|&s;elves in his &s;ituation, that we can form an impartial judgment on the propriety of his conduct. After con|&s;idering each of the&s;e di&s;patches, there is thrown to|gether the intelligence received &s;ub&s;equent to any or|ders given by him, but previous to the repeal of the <HI>&s;tamp act.</HI></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to begin by a de&s;cription of the &s;tate of this matter, when the &s;&mdash;ls of the &s;outhern depart|ment were put into the hands of Mr. C&mdash;y.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>&s;tamp act</HI> had received the <HI>royal a&s;|&s;ent,</HI> which was on the 22d. of <HI>March,</HI> 1765, the admini&s;tration which had planned it began to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might mo&s;t effectually carry it into execution: and though &s;uch complaints of the future burden had been received from <HI>America,</HI> as are ever made by tho&s;e who have been long indulgently ex|empted from bearing any; and though &s;ome of that country had proceeded even to deny the right of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to impo&s;e them; yet the act was not yet pa&s;&s;ed; and to impo&s;e and to &s;ecure the collection of the tax would be &s;o effectual a vindication of that right, that in lenity to the colonies any &s;everer ani|madver&s;ion on their conduct was &s;pared.</P>
<P><HI>This act</HI> had given a juri&s;diction for the recovery of the penalties, incurred by the breach of it, to the &s;ame
<PB N="12" REF="010663_0011_0F81E02AF12227D0">courts of admiralty which for near a century had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that juri&s;diction with regard to the laws of reve|nue and trade. This clau&s;e it had in common with tho&s;e laws which had formerly pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pecting &s;ub|jects of the like nature; but (and that was peculiar to this act) it provided a remedy for the <HI>inconveniences</HI> and <HI>abu&s;es,</HI> to which tho&s;e courts might be liable.</P>
<P>While our colonies were few in number, and &s;mall in extent, the court of admiralty could never be far di&s;tant from, nor its officers unknown to the clients in that court: but upon the encrea&s;e of them to their pre&s;ent greatne&s;s of territory and people, it had been a grievance complained of by the per&s;ons the mo&s;t loy|ally di&s;po&s;ed to the government of <HI>England,</HI> that the di&s;tance of many of the provinces from the &s;eat of this court, with the difficulty of obtaining the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lawyers, mu&s;t often operate &s;o as to bar the ju&s;te&s;t claim; and deprive the &s;ubjects of their property, by di&s;abling them from pro&s;ecuting their right to it.

<P>After receiving and con&s;idering the plans of the &s;tamp office, who were nece&s;&s;arily to be employed in it, for carrying the law into execution, they formed &s;uch in&s;tructions as might be adequate to the occa&s;ions of the officers to whom the execution of it was to be entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The choice of the&s;e officers was of great impor|tance; they did not therefore proceed to this ha&s;tily, or in the common track of official recommendation: they waited till they received from the mo&s;t re&s;pected men in each colony, applications in favour of per&s;ons of the be&s;t credit in it; and they complied with the&s;e, both as it gave the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t to be committed to the officers, and as it might much facilitate the collection of the duty.</P>
<P>Whoever reads the li&s;t of di&s;tributors appointed on this occa&s;ion, will &s;ee that the general intention was to be&s;tow that office on <HI>coloni&s;ts:</HI> this would prevent

The influence of this mea&s;ure would be the more exten&s;ive, as the appointment of the inferior di&s;tributors was nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ted in the prin|cipal di&s;tributor for every province; the per&s;ons ap|pointed by him would, it is probable, be his friends, neighbours or dependants, coloni&s;ts al&s;o; and the &s;ame motives would engage therefore throughout the coun|try a number of coloni&s;ts in the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In fact it appears, that this de&s;ign was generally ex|ecuted, except in the new colonies, in which de&s;crip|tion <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>Georgia</HI> are included; in the&s;e it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that any natives &s;hould be found capable of executing the office: but even in the&s;e the principal was &s;o &s;trictly adhered to, that in <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> a gentleman was &s;aid to be therefore appointed becau&s;e he was one of the fir&s;t <HI>&s;ettlers</HI> in that <HI>colony.</HI></P>

<P>It was plain, that although the &s;tamp act was the pretext, the re&s;trictions upon their trade, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and their de&s;ire <HI>to be</HI> independent of England, were among the real cau&s;es of many of the American tumul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; that impatience of all go|vernment which &s;ome of the coloni&s;ts expre&s;&s;ed, that oppo&s;ition both to the former and latter cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and commercial laws, which &s;ome even of their a&s;&s;emblies avowed, required to be immediately and effectually controuled. The nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure was not unknow to the admini&s;tration; the repre&s;en|tations of the board of trade had forced it upon their attention, and they them&s;elves confe&s;&s;ed it to be of <HI>the utmo&s;t importance to the kingdom and legi&s;lature of Great Britain.</HI> It was indeed of importance, for it impor|ted no le&s;s than the maintaining the dependence of the colonies more exten&s;ive than any nation before ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and the retaining in obedience to commercial laws, and directing the indu&s;try of an empire, upon who&s;e con&s;umption of our manufac|tures the trade and credit of this kingdom &s;o imme|diately depend. To &s;ecure the&s;e intere&s;ting objects the reader expects to hear, that the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures were planned and executed; that the &s;trength of government in that country was accurate|ly examined, and judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed; and that &s;uch additions to this, both of a military and naval

<P>The lawyers are the &s;ource from whence the clamours have &s;lowed in every province.

The whole body of merchants in general, a&s;&s;embly-men, magi&s;trates, &amp;c. have been united in this plan of riots, and with|out the influence and in&s;tigation of the&s;e, the inferior people would have been quiet: very great pains were taken to rouze them before they &s;tirred.</P>
<P>See too a curious paper in Appendix, No. 11.</P></NOTE>; but as this encrea&s;ed the danger of the in&s;ur|rections, and the nece&s;&s;ity of an interpo&s;ition, he con|tradicts without he&s;itation the intelligence in his hands, and <HI>hopes and expects</HI> (which words if they can mean any thing as applied to a thing pa&s;t mu&s;t mean <HI>bleieves</HI>) <HI>that this re&s;i&s;tance to the authority of the mother-country, can only have found place among the lower and more ignorant of the people.</HI> In&s;tead of that tone of authority which alone can enforce obedience of tho&s;e orders and directions which the dangerous &s;ituation of America, and the reque&s;ts of the officers there called for, the whole tenor of his letters is lan|guor and debility; it is true that &s;uch vague and gen|eral expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed, as leave the writer at liberty to own or to di&s;avow the mea&s;ures which &s;hall be per&s;ued after the receipt of the letter; to divide with or take from the officers to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, the reputation of their &s;ucce&s;s; or to turn on them a|lone the odium of a mi&s;carrige; and &s;uch qualify|ing words intermixed, as by a cautious hand are eve|u&s;ed to prevent if po&s;&s;ible any parliamentary danger but it is impo&s;&s;ible to read it without &s;eeking that the intent is rather to check, than to exice the ar|dour
<PB N="39" REF="010663_0038_0F81E045800971F8">of the officers of the crown; not to quell the riots of which he &s;aw the tendency, but to elude any operations which might di&s;courage tho&s;e di&s;turbances by which he meant to profit. If this purpo&s;e was le&s;s evident than it is in his di&s;patches, it is put out of doubt by the declaration which the &s;ame officer is &s;aid
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This is expre&s;t doubtfully, becau&s;e the authority is doubtful.</NOTE> to have made, <HI>that he would &s;ooner cut off his right hand than order troops to march to &s;up|pre&s;s this claim of freedom.</HI> His letter is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his declaration; and tho' we lament that his conduct has lo&s;t to Great-Britain the hands of all the inhabitants of America, yet we mu&s;t ac|knowledge that the right-hand of that right honour|able Gentleman is perfectly &s;afe.</P>
<P>To be convinced of the evil effects which the&s;e his di&s;&s;ertations upon prudence and levity mu&s;t have had in the mid&s;t of &s;o much tumult, let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that the procra&s;tinating &s;&mdash;y had &s;till procra&s;tinated; even his delay or his neglect would have been le&s;s pernicious to his country than di&s;patches of &s;o much <HI>Caution.</HI> The officers in Ame|rica might &s;till have hoped, that their obedience to the laws of England, amid&s;t the general contempt of them, would be e&s;teemed a &s;ervice, and receive encouragement and &s;upport; they might have conti|nued to encourage the loyal, and to check the vio|lence of the rebellious, by turning the eyes of both toward <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who would reward her friends, cha&s;ti&s;e her foes, and vindicate her ju&s;t authority. The arrival of the pacquet deprived them even of this re&s;ource: They &s;aw the mini&s;ters in England either too timed to enforce the law, or determined to &s;u&s;pend and repeal it; and they &s;aw therefore the folly of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the fury of an enra|ged
<PB N="40" REF="010663_0039_0F81E0464DA43FA0">people, in &s;upport of an act which the admini|&s;tration did not intend to execute. If the&s;e obvious reflections did not immediately occur to the officers them&s;elves, they were however &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted to them by the oppo&s;ers of the act; for the Americans &s;aw this conduct in its true light; in that in which the &s;&mdash;y mu&s;t have wi&s;hed them to &s;ee it: They had formed hopes of it as &s;oon as they were informed of his promotion; they expre&s;s them thus

<P>When therefore the di&s;obedient &s;aw the&s;e expect|ations an&s;wered by the &s;&mdash;y's di&s;patch, they, who had no re&s;train&s;t upon them but the fear of Engli&s;h di&s;plea&s;ure, were convinced too by the&s;e letters that they might offend with impunity; when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw a total annihilation of government &s;ubmitted to, and an avowed and violent re&s;i&s;tance to the Engli&s;h parlia|ment calling forth the <HI>utmo&s;t lenity</HI> they perceived that the mini&s;try, though they did not yet venture to avow, did however approve their proceeding; that they had nothing to fear from their di&s;plea&s;ure, or from their orders, without which no American offi|cer would take any deci&s;ive &s;tep; and they receiv|ed from hence that degree of encouragement which nothing el&s;e could have given to them</P>
<P>The intentions of the mini&s;try are proved, not only by the &s;teps which they did take, but al&s;o from their neglect of tho&s;e which they ought to have taken. It is not always ju&s;t to argue a criminality of this kind from an omi&s;&s;ion, but it is impo&s;&s;ible not to de|duce it in this ca&s;e; becau&s;e the omi&s;&s;ion was that
<PB N="41" REF="010663_0040_0F81E048E8240BF8">of a &s;tep which the importance of the object, the requi|&s;itions of the American officers, and the repre&s;entati|ons of the Board of Trade had &s;hewn them to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and which they had confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;o <HI>in their own report.</HI></P>
<P>To be convinced of this, let us &s;uppo&s;e that every thing hitherto had been well conducted; let us grant, that on the 14th of September the &s;&mdash;y could not even gue&s;s what he &s;hould determine on the 3d of October, concerning a matter, on which he had had the time pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the 27th of July to meditate; and therefore that he acted with all po&s;&s;ible vigour as well as caution, when, after an interval of more than &s;ix weeks, he referred the officers in America to a future deci&s;ion of the privy council for their in&s;tructions; let us imagine too, that till the 3d of October he tho't &s;o lightly of the privy council, as to expect that they would decide on a matter too high for their deliberation; and that he did not know that it was neither his nor their province to debate upon the propriety of laws, but that it was his duty to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the exe|cution of them. At lea&s;t, by the <HI>report</HI> of the privy council made on that day, his uncertainties mu&s;t have been removed; they were removed; he him&s;elf joins at lea&s;t in that report which declares that, <HI>this matter is proper only for the con&s;ideration of parliament.</HI> There never had ari&s;en a point which from its impor|tance both in it&s;elf and in its con&s;equences, called more loudly for the intervention of that a&s;&s;embly: the &s;upport which might be clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed from near two milli|ons of people was to be determined by it; and the que&s;tion whether Great-Britain has a right to the obe|dience of her colonies, was involved in the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>This report had been made on the 3d of October; by the 8th of that month the admini&s;tration had au|thentic and particular intelligence, that the principles
<PB N="42" REF="010663_0041_0F81E049EA620960">of re&s;i&s;tance and independence, which had been un|checked, had produced their natural con&s;equences, tumult and rebellion. What now does the reader ex|pect from a mini&s;try, which doubtful in it&s;elf, and looking round for direction, had not hitherto been able to receive any, but that they &s;hould immediately have had recour&s;e to that council for which no matter is too high; from which the repeal of every law found in|expedient is to take its ri&s;e, the authority of which would &s;ecure obedience to it till the propriety of the repeal had been con&s;idered, and to which the repre&s;en|tation of the Board of Trade and <HI>their own report</HI> referred them? The great council of the kingdom? He expects to &s;ee a proclamation, dated on the 9th of October, which would have a&s;&s;embled the parliament by the latter end of November. An immediate call of the &s;enate was the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it was rea&s;onable to expect that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;o impor|tant a &s;ubject would employ &s;ome time; the admini|&s;tration <HI>could not be a&s;&s;ured</HI> that the parliament, which had been almo&s;t unanimous in approving the princi|ples, and enacting the clau&s;es of the &s;tamp-act, would immediately and without he&s;itation con&s;ent to the re|peal of it. The fact is, that &s;ixteen days after the re|ceipt of this intelligence, the mini&s;try, in &s;pite of the call from the di&s;tre&s;s of a whole continent, from their own neglect, from their own acknowledgments, advi&s;|ed the k&mdash;g to prorogue the parliament; it was pro|rogued on the 24th of October, and on the very &s;ame day on which they betrayed the empire of Great-Britain, by the timid duplicity of the in&s;tructions &s;ent abroad, they deprived her too of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which might have been received from more vigorous coun|&s;els at home</P>
<P>A conduct which can be accounted for only by one motive; they had re&s;olved from &s;pleen, faction, jea|lou&s;y,
<PB N="43" REF="010663_0042_0F81E04A96D6A630">or re&s;entment to repeal an act, the &s;ucce&s;s and good effects of which would &s;till have encrea&s;ed the reputation of the mini&s;ter who planned it; they feared that the authority and the wi&s;dom of parliament would be able even yet to check the rebellion of the pro|vinces, and enforce the law; they wi&s;hed this rebelli|on &s;hould gain &s;trength, that they might apply to the fears of tho&s;e, who&s;e rea&s;on they could not hope to convince; they &s;acrificed to the&s;e views the permanent intere&s;ts and honor of the &s;tate, and encouraged by their connivance, and by the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ogation of the par|liament, that re&s;i&s;tance and tho&s;e tumults, which they meant to apply to their own factious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Unhappily for the public, the&s;e de&s;igns were but too &s;ucce&s;sful; the riots in America became more gene|ral, and more dangerous: it will appear by the intel|ligence &s;ub&s;equent to this period, of which I &s;hall now &s;tate &s;ome part, as nearly as may be, in the order of time in which it is dated, that even their wi&s;hes could not form a &s;cene of greater anarchy than their conduct had produced in America; that they were informed very minutely of a total di&s;&s;olution of every part of government, and that although the &s;tamp-act was the pretext, yet the cau&s;es and the objects of their re&s;ent|ment were al&s;o the re&s;traints on their trade, and their &s;ubjection to Great-Britain: the&s;e were really felt, while the &s;tamp-act which was formed to execute it|&s;elf, which affected &s;carcely any but tho&s;e of who&s;e ability the very payment was a proof, which was confe&s;&s;ed by the Americans to be the mo&s;t eligible of all the taxes which could be impo&s;ed, and which, as it had not been executed, could not yet have been oppre&s;&s;ive, was only the occa&s;ion of the&s;e in&s;urrections.</P>

<P>It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the admini&s;tration did not pay more regard to the&s;e and the like complaints, of which the letters to them are full, than they had done to the other requi&s;itions on the &s;ame &s;ubject.

<PB N="54" REF="010663_0053_0F81E052A38E3FC8">that an order of the privy-council was made
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See Order of council, dated St. James's, Oct. 23, 1765.</NOTE>, directing, <HI>That orders &s;hould be given to the commander of the land and &s;ea forces in America, for their concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing riots, when called upon by the governors for that purpo&s;e:</HI> and it is equally true, that the lords of the trea&s;ury ordered a circular letter to be written to the governors, directing them to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the collection of the &s;tamp-duty, and to &s;ee that the revenue received no damage: an in&s;truction exactly equal in efficacy with that exhortation, which the in|qui&s;itors give with &s;o much charity to the civil magi&s;|trate, to take care of the unhappy victim, whom they have them&s;elves devoted and doomed to de&s;truction. It is impo&s;&s;ible to read the &s;&mdash;y's letter of the 24th of October, (&s;ee Appendix, No. 4.) and not be &s;en&s;i|ble, that the governors mu&s;t have &s;een it was the in|tention of the mini&s;try that force &s;hould not be em|ployed; and that they mu&s;t expect therefore to an&s;wer in their own per&s;ons for every fatal, though accidental con&s;equence, which might attend the employing it: under the&s;e circum&s;tances there was danger that the governors &s;hould call upon the commanders for an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their efforts, the &s;ucce&s;s of which gave them nothing to hope, while the mi&s;carriage left them every thing to fear.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration had, however, a &s;till &s;tronger &s;ecurity that <HI>the occurrences</HI> in America &s;hould not be interrupted by force. They thought that, on that continent a number of men, equal to the exigence, could not be a&s;&s;embled; and they determined that no more &s;hould be &s;ent thither. Of the former of the&s;e points the &s;&mdash;y had been informed authentically, as he cho&s;e to think, by the commander in chief of his Maje&s;ty's forces in America; this appears by the an|&s;wer which he returns to that officer;

<P>It will perhaps appear, by a peru&s;al of tho&s;e letters from the commander in chief, which are to be found in the collection of papers made on this occa&s;ion, that of the <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> of drawing a con&s;iderable number of men together he &s;ays nothing: he &s;ays the forces are greatly &s;cattered and divided over that va&s;t conti|nent, that a junction might be prevented by the fro&s;t, &amp;c. but a mini&s;ter who had wi&s;hed to act with vigour, might have given orders to act if the junction could be made; and if the&s;e orders had been given, they had been executed; for a &s;ub&s;equent letter

So far were the mini&s;try from attending to this, &s;o far from &s;ending to the continent an aug|mentation, that they prevented that increa&s;e of force which the common military rotation would have carried thither. For the time was now coming when the re|giments, which were on duty in that part of the world, were to be relieved by tho&s;e from Ireland. About 2500 men are carried to America for this purpo&s;e; and as the regiments which have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tated time of their &s;ervice there, are at the &s;ame time drawn down to the coa&s;t for embarkation, the junction of the&s;e,

<P>The&s;e were all the &s;teps which the mini&s;try had taken to execute the laws of their country, and to pre&s;erve the allegiance of America, before the meet|ing of parliament.

<P>All the intelligence has now been laid together, which was received after the 24th of October, 1765, and prior to the meeting of the parliament; and none has been produced, which was received after the Hou&s;e of Commons had taken this matter into their con&s;ide|ration. For by the&s;e means the reader is enabled to compare the intelligence with the conduct of the ad|mini&s;tration; and to determine in what degree they merit his approbation or cen&s;ure, as mini&s;ters entru&s;ted with the execution of the laws of their country: a

Now that the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rment rai&s;ed on this occa&s;ion has &s;ub&s;ided, one can &s;carcely believe this fact tho' &s;o recent and authentic; or that &s;uch means and in&s;truments &s;hould produce, as they did produce, the repeal of the &s;tamp-act. For it was in vain that, to the popular panic, every argument was oppo&s;ed, which the principles of ju&s;tice, of the con&s;titution, of policy, even of intere&s;t could furni&s;h. It was in vain that tho&s;e, who were &s;o unpopular as to de|fend the cau&s;e of Great-Britain, urged that the &s;tamp act had pa&s;&s;ed upon the mo&s;t general and acknowledged grounds of Whig policy, is due in re|turn for the protection on the part of government; that taxation &s;hould be extended over all the parts of a &s;tate, in proportion to the relative ability found in each, If, &s;aid they, we examine the arguments by which the Americans would prove their right of exemption, we &s;hall &s;ee that the admi&s;&s;ion of them di&s;&s;olves at once the con&s;titution of our country: if the legi&s;lature has no power but over tho&s;e who vote for the election of the members which form one part of it, not only all our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in A&s;ia, Africa and America are exempted from any obedience to the laws of trade, revenue and police, pa&s;&s;ed in En|gland; but even nineteen-twentieths of the inhabi|tants of Great-Britain are relea&s;ed from their &s;ubjec|tion; and intituled to return to that &s;avage freedom on which every re&s;trictive law is an u&s;urpation. But it is not from its ab&s;urd and pernicious con&s;equen|ces
<PB N="62" REF="010663_0061_0F81E058B52FE010">alone that we prove the fal&s;ehood of this maxim; it proceeds from an ignorance of the nature and powers of our con&s;titution. The Commons of Great-Britain, a&s;&s;embled in parliament, are not only the repre&s;entatives of the counties and buroughs who depute them, but of all the commons of the realm: they are entru&s;ted with the intere&s;ts, appointed to guard the liberties, relieve the burthens, and redre&s;s the grievances of the whole kingdom; there is no part of it but is entituled to their protection, there is none therefore which is exempted from their au|thority; the contrary doctrine dimini&s;hes their utility, degrades their character, and reduces them from the honourable and exten&s;ive office of being the guardians and councellors of a whole kingdom, to that of burgoma&s;ters for a petty, &s;ometimes an un|inhabited borough. It is one of the fir&s;t duties to whom this important tru&s;t is committed to execute it, and e&s;pecially that unplea&s;ing but nece&s;&s;ary part of it the power of taxation, in the mo&s;t impartial manner; it is this alone which can induce the &s;ub|ject to bear with patience the burthen of impo&s;ts; will you not then betray the tru&s;t of your con&s;tituents, if you &s;uffer any part of the people to force an ex|emption from tho&s;e taxes which the publick exigen|cies require to be impo&s;ed on the whole; and will you not de&s;troy that confidence on which all govern|ment is founded?</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctions which have been made on this &s;ubject are not well grounded; <HI>The parliament has the right of impo&s;ing external, not internal duties: and it will be proper to lay on the Americans every burthen which the hand of power can impo&s;e, if they &s;hould at|tempt to become manufacturers.</HI> The&s;e &s;entiments have been delivered and received as maxims; but the dif|ference between the right of impo&s;ing internal and
<PB N="63" REF="010663_0062_0F81E0599CB6C8C8">external duties is merely imaginary, grounded on no principle of ju&s;tice or policy, contradictory to the claims of the Americans, who&s;e <HI>re&s;olutions
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. 7 and 14,</NOTE> a&s;&s;ert their exemption from all duties not impo&s;ed by them&s;elves;</HI> and is treated as an idle di&s;tinction by Mr. Otis, the cho&s;en champion of American privileges. The other maxim, that of forbidding manufactures, &s;eems a much greater and le&s;s ju&s;tifiable infringement of the rights claimed by the Americans, than the im|po&s;ing on them a tax for their own defence, is with difficulty to be re&s;olved into any principle but that of power; and mu&s;t be very uncertain in its extent and operation; whereas that of the &s;tamp act is founded in ju&s;tice, and of certain and acknowledged extent and application,</P>
<P>The ability of America, to rai&s;e this proportion of the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for their own defence, admits of no doubt; the pre&s;&s;ure of debt upon them, of which as of a popular topic, they have made &s;ome u&s;e, was at the end of the war not quite 2,600,000 <HI>l:</HI> it is already reduced to about 767.000 <HI>l,</HI> and the greater part of this will be paid of in two or three years by funds provided for that Purpo&s;e. The whole &s;um expected to be rai&s;ed by the &s;tamp-du|ty was 100, 000 <HI>l</HI> a year; the repartition of this upon 1,500, 000 people, at which the lowe&s;t com|putation e&s;timates the pre&s;ent inhabitants of that country, would not draw from each per&s;on more than half the value of a day's labour in America. England has even furni&s;hed them with re&s;ources to rai&s;e the revenue &s;he has required; the bounties given to them on two or three articles alone would enable them to &s;upport the new impo&s;itions; and the increa&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hment there furni&s;hes them with another fund, which alone would more than balance the account; it is &s;ufficient to mention this,
<PB N="64" REF="010663_0063_0F81E05A4B231300">for it is not on this ground that the Americans wi&s;h to &s;tand; they do not plead poverty, but priviledge; and have re&s;ted their inability to &s;upport, but their cau&s;e, not upon their right of exemption from an Engli&s;h tax.</P>
<P>The manner in which the re&s;i&s;tance has been ex|erted, proves &s;till more &s;trongly the nece&s;&s;ity of op|po&s;ing it with firmne&s;s. Riots in the capitals of the provinces, per&s;onal attacks on our officers, in|&s;ults on our government, the&s;e are the actions by which they have accompained and &s;upported tho&s;e re&s;olutions of their a&s;&s;emblies which di&s;claimed our authority. The mini&s;try, partial as they are to the Americans, have them&s;elves acknowledged that in the&s;e circum&s;tances it would be di&s;graceful, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to repeal the act. Read, in the di&s;|patches of Mr. C&mdash;y, who will not be &s;u&s;pected of a&s;&s;erting the rights of Great-Britain in too high a tone, this point determined.

<P>From the time of writing the&s;e letters, the di&s;re&s;pect to parliament, the violent re&s;i&s;tance to acts of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, and tho&s;e outrages, by which they were &s;upported, have been continually encrea&s;ing; the di&s;grace therefore and the danger are proportionally encrea&s;ed, and tho&s;e &s;entiments
<PB N="65" REF="010663_0064_0F81E05ADEBA7098">which then animated him are &s;trengthened too; it is impo&s;&s;ible therefore that the mini&s;try can, without acting in direct contradiction to them&s;elves as well as to their duty, propo&s;e that the re&s;pect due to parliament &s;hould be made a &s;acrifice to local and dangerous prejudices. To make this &s;acrifice will deter both future mini&s;ters from forming any &s;chemes for the public utility, which may expo&s;e them to be &s;acrificed to combinations of private intere&s;t, the clamour of multitudes, or the ma|lice of faction; and future officers from executing acts of parliament, for and in that country; and will con|tribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of the de&s;ign which the mo&s;t de&s;perate of the coloni&s;ts have formed <HI>to make G.

<P>The&s;e, and the other arguments, which were drawn from all the great and intere&s;ting topics with which the &s;ubject abounds, were &s;carcely heard, for it was rea&s;on only which &s;poke: the tumult of popular fear ex|pre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in louder terms, and was more attended to. The Americans had withdrawn their commi&s;&s;ions; they threatened to withhold the payment of their debts; the fir&s;t of the&s;e was an illegal and ho&s;tile combina|nation to di&s;tre&s;s our manufacturers, a &s;tep rather al|lowable in an equal when in a &s;tate of war, than in &s;ubjects who pretend to be in peace: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t was &s;uch a breach of private faith as is not practi&s;ed even in time of war between jealous commercial rivals; and
<PB N="66" REF="010663_0065_0F81E05BAF584CE0">both of them means which would always be in the power of the Americans to u&s;e, and would hereafter be recurred to with an a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s: and yet the&s;e rea&s;ons, which would have made it di&s;graceful and unwi&s;e to have given way in an indifferent matter, operated &s;o &s;trongly on the multitude that they per|&s;waded them we ought to recede in the ju&s;te&s;t cau&s;e, and from the &s;tronge&s;t ground. Petitions were obtain|ed, the manufacturers excited, the merchants clamo|rous, the mini&s;try, intere&s;ted and factious, directed to their own purpo&s;es the re&s;i&s;tance and the clamours which they had rai&s;ed; and the legi&s;lature, with a conde&s;cen&s;ion to popular alarm, and a lenity to the colonies which demands the ample&s;t returns of grati|tude and obedience, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for the repeal of the &s;tamp-act.</P>
<P><HI>The conduct of the late admini&s;tration</HI> has now been &s;tated from authentic vouchers; it is time to examine the merits of it with regard to the crown, to America, and to Great-Britain. In &s;peaking of that admini|&s;tration, I would be under&s;tood to &s;peak generally; I do not pretend to be informed by what part of it the coun&s;els were planned; it is therefore left to them to divide in the proper proportions that prai&s;e to which the public &s;hall think them entituled. If the f&mdash;y for the f&mdash;n department was only the hand; I de|&s;ire to charge him only with being the hand; though to the &s;tate he is accountable for the plan of tho&s;e coun|&s;els by which his department is conducted: a weight which he has with great prudence and caution contriv|ed, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to &s;hift on other &s;houlders, by a &s;tratagem exactly equal with that of a much fatter com|mander, who prudently withdrew when he had <HI>led his raggam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ffins where they might be peppered.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t whom their conduct regards is a name which &s;hould never be mixed amid the tumult of party

It is the great advantage which limited and mixed monarchies have over tho&s;e of a more de&s;potic ca&s;t, that in them there are &s;o many in|termediate &s;ubordinate powers between the king and his people, that the love and reverence, which for the public good it is expedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt be &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, may al|ways be retained to him. To this end it is nece&s;&s;ary that the private &s;entiments of the monarch &s;hould not be quoted at all; and that tho&s;e of his character &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed with a moderation and dignity equally re|moved from the vehemence of any party, that he may continue to all the object of veneration. The late ad|mini&s;tration offended again&s;t both the&s;e parts of their duty as mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It would perhaps be unju&s;t to reproach them with the effeminate, uncertain, and even ungrammatical ex|pre&s;&s;ions in which they cloath the &s;entiments which they attribute to their &s;overeign; &s;o different from that plain and natural &s;tyle which ought to convey the commands of an Engli&s;h king; becau&s;e it is probable that they u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion the be&s;t expre&s;&s;ions in their power.</P>

<P>They appear however to de&s;erve at lea&s;t the thanks of the Americans, who&s;e pre&s;ent intere&s;ts they have promoted, and of who&s;e privileges they are the avowed patrons; and yet there are many rea&s;ons which may induce tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the true intere&s;ts of that country, to think that they have not been &s;erved by the late project of emancipation. If it is true, as it has hitherto been pretty generally thought, that the good of each part is in&s;cparable from that of the whole, their intere&s;ts are involved in tho&s;e

It is true, that the Americans, under the &s;hade and protection of Great-Britain, have made rapid advances in population, com|merce and wealth; but are they &s;ufficiently &s;trong to flouri&s;h without her care; or to &s;upport, I will not &s;ay her re&s;entment, but her neglect: The provinces on the American continent have been &s;o divided in principles, &s;entiments and manners; &s;o jea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous of the progre&s;s of each other in &s;trength, commerce and riches, that they have ever been unable to form an union equal to their own defence.

<P>It tends too to alienate from them this affection, from which they have received &s;uch advantages, that they have been repre&s;ented to have &s;ome peculiar claims to a freedom which they purcha&s;ed by peculiar forti|tude;
<PB N="71" REF="010663_0070_0F81E05F83E52970">a repre&s;entation which is mo&s;t untrue. We have been told, that having <HI>fled to that country from our oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> their migration to America, as it argued in them a love, &s;o it gave them a title to freedom &s;u|perior to that of their fellow &s;ubjects who remained in England. But to e&s;teem the Americans our brethren, and to wi&s;h that they may de&s;erve and po&s;&s;e&s;s all the &s;weets of civil and religious liberty, which Great-Britain enjoys, does not make us forget that they re|ceived the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from England, and depend on her for the continuance of them. The truth of the latter of the&s;e propo&s;itions is obvious; the proof of the former would be ea&s;y but invidious; for the hi&s;tory of the&s;e colonies is not involved in that cloud of fa|ble which hangs over and aggrandizes the origin of more antient nations: It would not be difficult to give a detail of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of each; and it would appear from that detail that there are few of them who could claim any hereditary di&s;criminating privileges. Of the patriot coloni&s;ts of New-York it is &s;o far from being true that <HI>they fled from our oppre&s;&s;ion, or grew by our neglect,</HI> that they were Dutch &s;ubjects acquired by our arms, and received, by a formal ce&s;&s;ion from Holland in 1667, into our protection. Of the Vir|ginians, who&s;e <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> were the alarum-bell to re|bellion, and who have been e&s;teemed the great patrons of American privileges, it may be &s;aid with truth, that all the inhabitants of that colony did not retire thither from motives of religion and virtue; and that &s;ome of them at lea&s;t were removed to that place, not by the oppre&s;&s;ion but the mercy of the government of Eng|land. Nor is this peculiar to the colony of Virginia, for I find in one of the American new&s;papers, dated Bo&s;ton. September 2. 1765, that one of tho&s;e patriots who had been the mo&s;t active in foreing from Mr. John|&s;on a re&s;ignation of his &s;tamp-office was a <HI>foreigner</HI> (by
<PB N="72" REF="010663_0071_0F81E06020BDC278">which name I &s;uppo&s;e they do not yet de&s;cribe an Eng|li&s;hman) <HI>who had been tran&s;ported from England to Ame|rica.</HI> Such a detail would be but a mild return for all tho&s;e marks of neglect, contempt, and in&s;ult on Great-Britain, with which the writings of that country have abounded; it will however be more temperate only to &s;ay, that admitting that to be true of all the colo|nies, which is perhaps true only of the New-England governments, that the &s;ettlers of them retired thither to enjoy that liberty of which a monarch of arbitrary principles was endeavouring to deprive them at home; yet le&s;s prai&s;e is due to tho&s;e who fled from the danger, than to tho&s;e who had the courage to abide it. If their flight argued in them a love of freedom, their countrymen who remained in England &s;hewed by their actions an equal love of it, &s;upported with more re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s; they took arms to oppo&s;e the tyranny from which the others fled, averted it by the civil war, and abo|li&s;hed it by the revolution. In the&s;e two hazardous enterprizes, undertaken for the cau&s;e of liberty, the colonies took no part; they followed in both the fortunes of the mother-country; the patriots of which di&s;u&s;ed the advantages of their &s;ucce&s;s to the infant colonies after their &s;ettlement; and the coloni&s;ts there|fore have neither &s;hewn any peculiar attachment, nor can be entitled to any of tho&s;e &s;uperior claims to free|dom which have been &s;o invidiou&s;ly and fal&s;ely made in their behalf; but owe every branch of the liberties of Engli&s;hmen to the community of rights, which they are entitled to as long as they remain in that &s;ubjection to England, to which they are bound by the ties of gratitude, ju&s;tice and intere&s;t. In fact, the rights to which they have a ju&s;t claim, are rendered precarious by placing them on the ground, on which &s;ome of their imprudent advocates in England have concurred with &s;ome of their a&s;&s;emblies to place them.</P>

The franchi&s;es of Great-Britain are protected and pre&s;erved for all the &s;ubjects of the realm by the &s;ame power which defined and obtained them; for it was not by the flight of a few Plymouth adventurers, but by the courage and con&s;tancy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the people of England that the freedom of our con&s;titution was defended: <HI>the bill of rights, the act of &s;ettlement,</HI> on which all our liberties depend, are not the re&s;oluti|ons of an a&s;&s;embly of coloni&s;ts, but the acts of an Engli&s;h Parliament.

<P>The Americans indeed owe it to the connivance and encouragement of the la&s;t mini&s;try, that their people have been blooded with the prey of &s;edition; that they have been taught to obtain &s;upport by other means than indu&s;try, and privileges by other means than obedience; but whether the exciting and re|warding this temper will conduce to the happine&s;s of that continent, either in the &s;everal provinces, or con&s;idered as a common empire, is to be referred to the judgment of the wi&s;e and loyal of the coloni&s;ts: a judgment which they have already expre&s;&s;ed; for all the Americans are not to be involved in tho&s;e accu&s;ations of di&s;obedience, which have been proved on &s;ome. There have ever been among them men of wi&s;dom and moderation well acquainted with and attached to the con&s;titution of their country; and though &s;ome of the&s;e, driven as exiles to Great-Britain,

<P>In truth the Americans in general are le&s;s guilty than they may at fir&s;t &s;ight be thought: the de&s;ire of pre&s;ent ea&s;e is the common feeling of man, and the bulk of the people are &s;o entirely guided by their feelings that there is &s;carcely an in&s;tance of their &s;ubmitting to impo&s;ts however e&s;&s;ential to their in|tere&s;ts or even to their &s;afety, from any motives but tho&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. The Americans exerted only on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion the &s;ame &s;pirit, which animated the cyder counties to tumult and almo&s;t to rebellion: the&s;e counties are not invidiou&s;ly mentioned; for there is not, it is probable any part of our dominions, &s;carcely any county in England, which, if government in it had been &s;o neglected and relaxed, riots &s;o encouraged, and rebellion &s;o unchecked would not have expre&s;|&s;ed an equal aver&s;ion to the obnoxious burthen of taxes In viewing commotions of this kind it is natural to pity, while we condemn the unthinking and mi&s;gui|ded people: but on tho&s;e who could behold the fir&s;t ri&s;ing of the American &s;torm without even attempt|ing to &s;uppre&s;s it, could give it &s;trength by &s;uch a conduct as implied approbation; and, that they might bla&s;t their predece&s;&s;ors in office, contribute to rai&s;e a tempe&s;t which was to lay the colonies wa&s;te, and tear America from England; on the&s;e our indignation mu&s;t be poured unmixed; and they may well expect that the dangers and the mi&s;chiefs of the di&s;union, will bring on them the re&s;entment and reproaches of tho&s;e of the coloni&s;ts who under&s;tand their duty and their intere&s;ts.</P>

<P>The la&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t proof ari&s;es from their con|duct; for it is certain that in the town of Bo&s;ton, the execution of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e laws is now actu|ally &s;u&s;pended, and &s;eizures of &s;muggled goods pre|vented by open force in de&s;pite of the government of Great-Britain. Now then at length call on them for an aid in &s;ome proportion to their ability; and oblige them to confe&s;s, not in words, but by obedi|ence, the authority of England.

<P>I &s;ubmit to taxes as they are the purcha&s;e of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace and &s;ecurity; do not while you receive the price, withold the reward; nor encourage every &s;pecies of outrage tending to the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety by grant|ing tho&s;e exemptions to rebellion, which you refu&s;e to obedience. If tumult can extort the repeal of a du|ty to be levied chiefly on the rich, while acquie&s;cence is repaid by an additional and perpetual land tax on the poor, will you not exicte the in&s;urrections which you reward; and di&s;courage that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is thus made to bear more than its own bur|then? at lea&s;t do not treat with more tenderne&s;s your emancipated and rebllious coloni&s;ts than tho&s;e of your countrymen, who have perhaps been encourag|ed in tumult by American &s;ucce&s;s. If the poor En|gli&s;h pea&s;ant, driven into a temporary in&s;urruction by the whip of that &s;evere&s;t ma&s;ter Want, is taught to expect <HI>condign puni&s;hment and &s;peedy ju&s;tice,</HI> and calls forth the vigor and vigilance of government, let the wanton Americans forming a concerted plan of ob&s;tinate rebelion on occa&s;ion of a tax uncollected, and which would almo&s;t have been unfelt, awaken other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of the <HI>utmo&s;t lenity.</HI></P>
<P>To impo&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s on the Americans that proportion of the public burthen which they ought to bear, &s;eize the opportunity, while a general peace leaves you at liberty to employ in this &s;ervice, whatever force may be nece&s;&s;ary for it; and while the infirm and disjointed &s;tate of the provinces renders a &s;mall force
<PB N="81" REF="010663_0080_0F81DFA30B711B90">equal to the work; an opportunity which may &s;oon pa&s;s, and the neglect of which mu&s;t be fatal to the very &s;afety of Great-Britain. Other misfortunes may be repaired or borne, the lo&s;s of battles or of cities may be redeemed or compen&s;ated in more pro&s;perous hours; but if you &s;uffer this important hour to pa&s;s unimproved, it is lo&s;t forever: The Americans will add to confidence in their claims, &s;trength to &s;upport them; they will turn our favors to them into rea&s;ons of re&s;i&s;tance, and refu&s;e to receive any longer our manufactures, which are become expen&s;ive by being loaded with taxes impo&s;ed for their protection; they will cea&s;e to be the Colonies of England, and we &s;hall have more than doubled the burthen of our national debt in a war undertaken for their defence, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of which were all directed to their advantage, to enable them to pour the benefits of their trade into the bo&s;om of our commercial rivals. The declaratory law a&s;&s;erting the power of Great-Britain to tax the Americans, will hold forth <HI>only a delu&s;ive and nugatory affirmance of the right of the legi&s;lature of this kingdom,</HI> if not followed by &s;ome bill which &s;hall exert it. The &s;urrender of &s;o unalienable a juri&s;diction, when this &s;ur|render might, and certainly in America would be at|tributed to &s;uch motives, demands a &s;ub&s;equent vigour and firmne&s;s; if now, when time for recollection has been given, you neglect to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity demand from you; and to which duty, gratitude and intere&s;t ought to &s;ecure obe|dience from them, the whole new world cea&s;es for ever to be &s;ubject to your authority.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters for the purpo&s;es of intere&s;t and party may wi&s;h to continue this partial exemption; but you can act from no motives but tho&s;e of ju&s;tice; your intere&s;t is united to your duty; and you cannot without depart|ing from both give any &s;upport to a mini&s;ter capable

If the public &s;ee with regret the power of government in the hands of lord C&mdash;m, it is from the dread not &s;o much even of his continen|tal, as of his colonial &s;y&s;tem: It was from the com|merce of the American part of our dominions that tho&s;e re&s;ources were to be drawn, which his extravagance have rendered &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. But to continue every &s;pecies of profu&s;ion, and, by throwing wantonly his pen&s;ions into every open hand, to load the pre&s;ent re|venue; while by emancipating the colonies he prevents even future improvements; is at once to divide the river of our wealth 'till it is lo&s;t in a thou&s;and private channels, and to cut off its communication from that &s;pring, by which it &s;hould be &s;upplied. We had le&s;s to fear from the inability of the la&s;t, than from the de&s;perate ra&s;hne&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;tate&s;man; if the for|mer connived at the coloni&s;ts withdrawing them&s;elves from our dominion, this profe&s;&s;es on principles to throw them from us.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure I received his Maje&s;ty's Commands to declare to you his mo&s;t gracious approba|tion of your conduct. His Maje&s;ty and his &s;ervants are &s;a|tisfied, that the precipitate re&s;olutions you &s;ent home did not take their ri&s;e from any remi&s;&s;ne&s;s or inattention in you; nor is his Maje&s;ty at all inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that any in|&s;tance of diffidence or di&s;&s;atisfaction could be founded in the general inclination of his antient and loyal Colony of Vir|ginia; the nature of the thing and your repre&s;entations in|duce a per&s;ua&s;ion, that tho&s;e ill-advi&s;ed re&s;olutions owed their birth to the violence of &s;ome individuals, who taking the advantage of a thin a&s;&s;embly, &s;o far prevailed, as to publi&s;h their own uninformed opinions to the world as the &s;entiments of the Colony. But his Maje&s;ty, Sir, will not, by the prevalence of a few men, at a certain moment, be per&s;uaded to change the opinion, or le&s;&s;en the confidence, he has always entertained of the Colony of Virginia; which has always experienced the protection of the Crown. His Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, therefore, with entire reliance on your prudence, and on the virtue and wi&s;dom of the Colony en|tru&s;ted to your care, per&s;uade them&s;elves, that when a full a&s;&s;embly &s;hall calmly and maturely deliberate upon tho&s;e re|&s;olutions, they will &s;ee, and be them&s;elves alarmed at, the dangerous tendency and mi&s;chievous con&s;equences which they might be productive of, both to the Mother Country and the Colonies, which are the equal objects of his Maje&s;ty's parential care; and who&s;e mutual happine&s;s and pro&s;perity certainly require a confidential reliance of the Colonies upon the Mother Country.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="010663_0085_0F81DFA623B18320">
Upon the&s;e principles, Sir, and upon your prudent ma|nagement, and a proper repre&s;entation to the wi&s;e &amp; &s;ober part of the people, how earne&s;t his Maje&s;ty is to extend the happy influence of his fatherly care over every part of his dominions, it is expected that a full a&s;&s;embly will form very different re&s;olutions, &s;uch as may cement that union, which alone can e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the Colonies and the Mother Country.</P>
<P>As there is no intention in the Crown to attempt, nor in the King's &s;ervants to advi&s;e, any incroachments on the real rights and liberties of any part of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects; &s;o neither will his Maje&s;ty undoubtedly &s;ubmit, or his &s;ervants advi&s;e, under any circum&s;tances, that the re&s;|pect which is due to parliament, and which is nece&s;&s;ary for the general good of the whole Briti&s;h empire, &s;hould any where be made a &s;acrifice to local and dangerous prejudices.</P>
<P>As this important matter is, however, now before his Ma|je&s;ty's privy council, as well as the other con&s;ideration of the dangerous riot and mutinous behaviour of the people on the frontiers, <HI>I &s;hall not pretend to give any advice or in|&s;tructions on the&s;e &s;ubjects;</HI> not doubting, but you will &s;oon have the fulle&s;t from the wi&s;dom of that Board, in all tho&s;e things, in which, by your la&s;t accounts, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;t of the Colony are &s;o deeply concerned.</P>
<P>You will therefore, in the mean time, be very attentive, by every prudent mea&s;ure in your power, at once to main|tain the ju&s;t rights of the Briti&s;h government, and to pre|&s;erve the peace and tranquility of the Provinces committed to your care.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e appear to me matters of government fit for his Maje&s;ty's more immediate notice and information, I mu&s;t beg you will not fail to tran&s;mit to me &s;uch occurrences, from time to time, on the&s;e heads, as you may deem of importance in the light I mention. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>It is hoped, and expected, that this want of confidence in the ju&s;tice and tenderne&s;s of the Mother Country, and this open re&s;idance to its authority, can only have found place among the lower and more ignorant of the people. The better and wi&s;er part of the Colonies will know, that de|cency and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion may prevail, not only to redre&s;s grie|vances, but to obtain grace and favour, while the outrage of a public violence can expect nothing but &s;everity and cha&s;ti&s;ement. You, and all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, from a &s;en&s;e of your duty to, and love of, your Country, will en|deavour to excite and encourage the&s;e &s;entiments.</P>

It is with the greate&s;t concern his Maje&s;ty learns the di&s;|turbances which have lately ari&s;en in your Province, the ge|neral confu&s;ion that &s;eems to reign there, and the total languor and want of energy, in your government, to exert it&s;elf with any dignity or efficacy, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tu|mults, which &s;eem to &s;trike at the very being of all authority and &s;ubordination among you.

<P>Nothing can, certainly, exceed the ill advi&s;ed and in|temperate conduct held by a party in your Province, which can in no way contribute to the removal of any real griev|ance they might labour under, but may tend to ob&s;truct and impede the exertion of his Maje&s;ty's benevolent atten|tion to the ea&s;e and comfort, as well as the welfare, of all his people.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 15, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the favour of your letters of the 4th, 8th, and 9th of November la&s;t, by which I learn, with the utmo&s;t concern, the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the Province where you re|&s;ide, and the very riotous and outrageous behaviour of too many of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>I did not fail to lay your di&s;patches, together with tho&s;e of lieutenant-governor Colden, before his Maje&s;ty, who, though highly provoked by &s;uch an in&s;ult offered to his go|vernor there, is however plea&s;ed to hear, that matters were not pu&s;hed to &s;uch extremity, as might have co&s;t the lives of many of his &s;ubjects, and perhaps have tended, as you &s;eem apprehen&s;ive, to the great detriment, if not ruin, of the town of New-York; particularly if the fort had fired on that in|&s;olent and infatuated mob, which &s;o provokingly approach|ed. The temper &s;hewn, as well by lieutenant-governor Colden, as by the officers there, is highly to be commended. His Maje&s;ty is willing to &s;uppo&s;e, that both your&s;elf and governor Colden have acted on principles of duty to his &s;ervice, in the advice and re&s;olution formed to put the &s;tampt paper into the hands of the magi&s;trates of New-York;
<PB N="92" REF="010663_0091_0F81DFABAB8718D0">which, however, unle&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity for it appeared very pre&s;&s;ing, mu&s;t certainly be looked upon as a &s;tep greatly humiliating and derogating to his Maje&s;ty's government.</P>
<P>If the po&s;t was not tenable, or the papers in&s;ecure there, it &s;hould &s;eem much preferable to have put them on board the man of war, as was propo&s;ed: nor does there appear any good rea&s;on, why captain Kennedy refu&s;ed to take them. It is difficult, at this di&s;tance, to judge with the &s;ame propriety of the conduct, to be held on occa&s;ions of &s;uch difficulty and importance, as on the &s;pot. Had the per&s;onal &s;afety of tho&s;e in the fort alone been con&s;idered, I am per&s;uaded, there would not have been a moment's he&s;i|tation about the defence of it, again&s;t any attack that might ra&s;hly have been attempted: nor can his Maje&s;ty &s;uppo&s;e any want of re&s;olution for his &s;ervice, in tho&s;e who have, in their different &s;tations, given &s;o many proofs of their regard to it. It &s;hould otherwi&s;e &s;eem, that the reality of the mobs being armed and prepared for an actual attack, &s;hould have been well a&s;certained before the papers were given up.</P>
<P>The &s;tep you have thought fit to take, in drawing toge|ther &s;uch forces as their &s;ituation allowed, was certainly pru|dent, and could not be too &s;oon determined, on any po&s;itive grounds, to &s;u&s;pect an in&s;urrection; and e&s;pecially in regard to the &s;ecuring his Maje&s;ty's &s;tores, a circum&s;tance which will &s;till demand your greate&s;t attention; and particularly tho&s;e arms, which may be &s;eized by the mob for their own mutinous purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Your &s;ituation is certainly delicate and difficult, it requires both prudence and firmne&s;s in the conduct of all employ|ed in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice there; e&s;pecially, con&s;idering what you &s;ay of the difficulty, or rather impo&s;&s;ibility, of drawing any con&s;iderable number of men together, and of the impracticability of attempting any thing by force, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the people, without a re&s;pectable body of troops.</P>
<P>You &s;eem to think there are &s;till hopes, that as the &s;pirits of tho&s;e unhappy people have time to cool, there will be more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;hewn; you will not fail, I am per&s;uaded, in your &s;tation, to avail your&s;elf of every favourable &s;ymptorn for the improvement of &s;uch favourable di&s;po&s;itions, any more than to exert your&s;elf, where the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e may require, in &s;upport of the honour of government, and for &s;urpre&s;&s;ing any riotous or rebellious re&s;i&s;tance offered to the laws, or tho&s;e magi&s;trates who have the execution of them.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="010663_0092_0F81DFACFAB17B70">
I hope my former letters are come &s;afe, <HI>as they will have conveyed to you his Maje&s;ty's &s;entiments and commands for your conduct, on the fir&s;t notice of the&s;e di&s;turbances.</HI></P>

<HI>Copy of a</HI> LETTER <HI>from Mr.</HI> S&mdash;Y C&mdash;Y, <HI>to Licute|nant-Governor</HI> COLDEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 15, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received your letter of the 5th of November by major James, and that of the 9th of the &s;ame month by the pacquet, with the minutes of the council of New-York, from the 31&s;t of October to the 6th of November, &amp;c.&mdash; From your la&s;t letter, I have hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> time will pro|duce a recollection, which may lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unhappy people back to a &s;en&s;e of their duty; and that, in the mean time, every proper and practicable mea&s;ure will be taken to awe that licentious &s;pirit, which has hurried them to tho&s;e acts of outrage and violence, equally dangerous to the &s;ober and well-di&s;po&s;ed part of the people, the ea&s;e and quiet of the city, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all order and authority among them.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Moore will certainly be arrived before this reaches you; it is expected, therefore, Sir, from your know|ledge of the country and people, that you &s;hould inform the new governor of every thing nece&s;&s;ary for his knowledge, as well re&s;pecting the &s;tate of things, as the characters and di&s;|po&s;itions of men in that country. He will &s;ee that, by his in&s;tructions, he is empowered to &s;u&s;pend members of the council, and officers of the law, who &s;hall appear to de&s;erve it; being, in that ca&s;e, only obliged to &s;end home immedi|ately the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es of &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. It is not improbable, that &s;uch times as the&s;e may require the exer|ci&s;e of that power: as it is not doubted the governor will u&s;e it with di&s;cretion, &s;o it is expected he &s;hould not want firmne&s;s to u&s;e it boldly, whenever it may &s;eem u&s;eful to the King's &s;ervice and the public peace.</P>

<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of your Maje&s;ty's Pro|vince of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay having, la&s;t year, printed and publi&s;hed, in the journals of their proceedings, a letter from a Committee of that Hou&s;e to their Agent here; in
<PB N="95" REF="010663_0094_0F81DFB0C7F99870">which letter the acts and re&s;olutions of the Parliament of Great-Britain were treated with the mo&s;t indecent di&s;re&s;pect, and principles tending to a denial of the right of Parliament to levy taxes upon your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in the Colonies, were openly avowed; our predece&s;&s;ors in office thought it their duty to tran&s;mit this tran&s;action to your Maje&s;ty's con|&s;ideration, to the end that &s;uch directions might be given, as the nature and importance of the matter &s;hould appear to require.</P>
<P>Since this, and &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing the act of Parliament for levying a &s;tamp duty in America, the grounds of which act gave ri&s;e to the reflections contained in the above-mentioned letter, the &s;ame &s;pirit that dictated the &s;entiments it expre&s;&s;es, has appeared throughout the whole proceedings of the &s;aid Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Upon the election of coun&s;ellors, who, by the con&s;titution of this Colony, are annually cho&s;en by the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, the &s;tronge&s;t endeavours were u&s;ed to preclude your Maje&s;ty's &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who has always been a member of the council from his &s;eat at that Board; and this, as your Maje&s;ty's governor repre&s;ents, merely on ac|count of his having received an appointment (un&s;olicited) to be a di&s;tributor of the &s;tamps: and the motion made in that Hou&s;e, to di&s;continue the annual &s;alary allowed for the &s;upport of your Maje&s;ty's governor, upon which proceeding we have this day made a &s;eperate repre&s;entation to your Maje&s;ty, &s;eems to have ari&s;en from the &s;ame motives.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, being only attempts of individuals in the community, would not either have required or de&s;erved your Maje&s;ty's attention, in the light in which we view them; but it further appears, from the journals of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, that <HI>this A&s;&s;em|bly, having thought fit to make the propriety and expediency of the &s;tamp-act, and of other acts of parliament, a &s;ubject of open que&s;tion and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,</HI> came to &s;everal re&s;olutions and proceedings thereupon, which they kept &s;ecret till the la&s;t day of their &s;e&s;&s;ion, when they publi&s;hed them in their print|ed journals&mdash;Then follow the re&s;olutions&mdash;Then the Board of Trade proceeds thus: The object of the re&s;olutions and proceedings of <HI>the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay,</HI> is to recommend to, and induce, the re&s;t of your Ma|je&s;ty's Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> to join in <HI>a general congre&s;s of committees from the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies, independent of the other branches of the legi&s;lature, and without any previous applica|tion
<PB N="96" REF="010663_0095_0F81DFB21C1AA808">to your Maje&s;ty, to con&s;ider and deliberate upon the acts of the parliament of this kingdom.</HI> As this appears to us to be the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a general congre&s;s, appointed by the A&s;&s;emblies of the Colonies without the authority of the Crown; a mea&s;ure which we conceive of dangerous ten|dency in it&s;elf, and more e&s;pecially &s;o, when taken for the purpo&s;es expre&s;&s;ed in the above-mentioned re&s;olution, and connected with the &s;pirit that has appeared throughout the whole conduct of this particular A&s;&s;embly; we therefore think it our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to &s;ubmit this matter to your Maje&s;ty's con&s;ideration, for &s;uch directions as your Maje&s;ty, with the advice of your Council, may think proper and ex|pedient to give thereupon.</P>

<P>THE re&s;olves of the A&s;&s;embly of Virginia, which you will have &s;een, gave the &s;ignal for a general outcry over the Continent; and though I do not find, that the A&s;&s;embly of any other Province has yet come to re&s;olutions of the &s;ame tendency, they have been applauded as the pro|tectors and a&s;&s;ertors of American liberty; and all per&s;ons excited and encouraged by writings in the public papers, and &s;peeches, without any re&s;erve, to oppo&s;e the execution of the act: the general &s;cheme concerted, throughout &s;eems to have been, fir&s;t, by menace or force, to oblige the &s;tamp officers to re&s;ign their employments, in which they have ge|nerally &s;ucceeded; and next, to de&s;troy the &s;tampt papers upon their arrival; that, having no &s;tamps, nece&s;&s;ity might be an excu&s;e for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s without them; and that, before they could be replaced, the clamour and out|cry of the people, with addre&s;&s;es and remon&s;trances from the A&s;&s;emblies, might procure a repeal of the act. The popu|lace of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> took the lead in the riots, and by an a&s;&s;ault upon the hou&s;e of the &s;tamp officer, forced him to a re&s;igna|tion. The little turbulent Colony of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> rai&s;ed their mob likewi&s;e; who were not content only to force a promi&s;e from the per&s;on appointed to di&s;tribute the &s;tamps, that he would not act in that employment, but al&s;o a&s;&s;aulted and de&s;troyed the hou&s;es and furniture of Me&s;&s;. Howard and Mo&s;&s;att, and obliged them to fly for &s;afety on board a &s;hip of wan: the fir&s;t, a lawyer of reputation, <HI>had wrote in de|fence of the rights of the Parliament of Great-Britain to lay taxes upon the colonies;</HI> the other a phy&s;ician, who had &s;up|ported the &s;ame in his conver&s;ations. The neighbouring Provinces &s;eemed inclined to follow the&s;e examples, but were prevented by the almo&s;t general re&s;ignation of the &s;tamp officers. The Bo&s;ton mob, rai&s;ed fir&s;t by the in&s;tigation or
<PB N="98" REF="010663_0097_0F81DFB2DE4A8440">many of the principal inhabitants, allured by plunder, ro&s;e &s;hortly after of their own accord; attacked, robbed, and de|&s;troyed &s;everal hou&s;es, and among&s;t others, that of the Lieutenant-governor, and only &s;pared the Governor's be|cau&s;e his effects had been removed. People then began to be terrified at the &s;pirit they had rai&s;ed; to perceive that popular fury was not to be guided, and each individual fear|ed he might be the next victim to their rapacity. The &s;ame fears &s;pread through the other Provinces, <HI>and there has been as much pains taken &s;ince, to prevent in&s;urrections of the peo|ple, as before to excite them.</HI></P>

<P>THE gentlemen of the law make the &s;econd cla&s;s, in which are properly included both the bench and the bar; both of them act on the &s;ame principles, and are of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed families in the policy of the Province.</P>
<P>The merchants make the third cla&s;s; <HI>many of them have &s;uddenly ro&s;e from the lowe&s;t rank of the people to con&s;iderable fortunes, and chiefly in the la&s;t war, by illicit trade; they abhor every limitation of trade and duties, and therefore gladly go into every mea&s;ure, whereby they hope to have trade free.</HI></P>
<P>The gentlemen of the law, both the judges, and the prin|cipal practitioners at the bar, are either owners, or &s;trongly connected in family intere&s;t with the proprietors in general. &mdash;The gentlemen of the law, &s;ome years &s;ince, entered into an a&s;&s;ociation, with intention, among other things, to a&s;&s;ume the direction of government upon them, by the influence they had in the a&s;&s;embly; gained by their family connections, and by the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, whereby they are unavoid|ably in the &s;ecrets of many families. Many court their friend&s;hip, and all dread their hatred; by the&s;e means, tho' few of them are members, they rule the Hou&s;e of the A&s;&s;em|bly, in all matters of importance; the greate&s;t number of the a&s;&s;embly being common farmers, who know little of men and things, and are ea&s;ily deluded and &s;educed.</P>
<P>By this a&s;&s;ociation, united in intere&s;t and family connec|tions with the proprietors of the great tracts, a domination of lawyers was formed in this province, which, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, has been too &s;trong for the executive powers of govern|ment.&mdash;Be&s;ides

<HEAD><HI>Extract of a Letter to the</HI> LORDS <HI>of</HI> TRADE, <HI>dated</HI> Aug. 15, 1765.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, at break of day, was di&s;cover|ed hanging upon a tree, in a &s;treet in the town, an effigy, with in&s;criptions, &s;hewing, that it was intended to re|pre&s;ent Mr. Oliver the &s;ecretary, who had lately accepted the office of Stamp Di&s;tributor. Some of the neighbours offered to take it down, but they were given to know, that would not be permitted. Many gentlemen, e&s;pecially &s;ome of the council, treated it as a boyi&s;h &s;port, that did not de|&s;erve the notice of the Governor and Council. However, the Lieutenant-governor, as chief ju&s;tice, directed the She|riff to order his officers to take down the effigy; and a Council was appointed to meet in the afternoon, to con&s;ider what &s;hould be done, if the Sheriff's officers were ob&s;tructed in removing the effigy.</P>
<P>Before the Council met, the Sheriff reported, that his officers had endeavoured to take down the effigy, but could not do it without imminent danger of their lives. The Council met, repre&s;ented this tran&s;action as the beginning of much greater commotions, and de&s;ired their advice what &s;hould be done upon this occa&s;ion. A majority of the Council &s;poke in form again&s;t doing any thing; but upon very different principles: &s;ome &s;aid it was a trifling bu&s;ine&s;s, which, if let alone, would &s;ub&s;ide of it&s;elf; but if taken notice of, would become a &s;erious affair. Others &s;aid, that
<PB N="100" REF="010663_0099_0F81DFB51E07FD00">it was a &s;erious affair already: that it was a preconcerted bu&s;ine&s;s, in which the greate&s;t part of the town was engag|ed: that there was no force to oppo&s;e it, and making an oppo&s;ition to it, without a power to &s;upport the oppo&s;ition, would only enflame the people, and be a means of extend|ing the mi&s;chief to per&s;ons not at pre&s;ent the objects of it. &mdash;The Sheriff was ordered to a&s;&s;emble the peace officers, and pre&s;erve the peace; a matter of form, rather than real &s;ignificance.</P>
<P>It now grew dark; when the mob, which had been ga|thering all the afternoon, came down to the Town-hou&s;e, bringing the effigy with them; and, knowing that they were &s;itting in the Council-chamber, they gave three huzzas, by way of defiance, and pa&s;&s;ed on. From thence they went to a new building, lately erected by Mr. Oliver to let out for &s;hops, and not quite fini&s;hed; this they called the Stamp-office, and pulled it down to the ground in five minutes. From thence they went to Mr. Oliver's hou&s;e, before which they beheaded the effigy, and broke all the windows next the &s;treet. Then they carried the effigy to Fort Hill, near Mr. Oliver's hou&s;e, where they burnt the effigy in a bonfire, made of the timber they had pulled down from the build|ing. Mr. Oliver had removed his family from his hou&s;e, and remained him&s;elf with a few friends, when the mob returned to attack the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Oliver was prevailed upon to retire, and his friends kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e: the mob finding the door bar|ricaded, broke down the whole fence of the garden towards Fort Hill; and coming on, beat all the doors and windows of the garden front, and entered the hou&s;e, the gentlemen there retiring. As &s;oon as they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earched about for Mr. Oliver, declaring they would kill him. Finding that he had left the hou&s;e, a party &s;et out to &s;earch two neighbouring hou&s;es, in one of which Mr. Oliver was; but, happily, they were diverted from this pur&s;uit by a gentleman telling them, that Mr. Oliver was gone with the Governor to the Ca&s;tle; otherwi&s;e he would certainly have been murthered. After eleven o'clock, the mob &s;eeming to grow quiet, the Lieutenant-governor, Chief Ju&s;tice, and the Sheriff, ventured to go to Mr. Oliver's hou&s;e, to endeavour to per&s;uade them to di&s;per&s;e: as &s;oon as they began to &s;peak, a ringleader cried out, "The Governor and the Sheriff, to your arms, my boys;" pre&s;ently after, a volley of &s;tones followed, and the two gentlemen narrowly
<PB N="101" REF="010663_0100_0F81DFB530BA9048">e&s;eaped, through favour of the night, not without &s;ome brui&s;es. I &s;hould have mentioned before, that a written order was &s;ent to the Colonel of the regiment of militia, to beat an alarm: he an&s;wered, that it would &s;ignify nothing, for, as &s;oon as the drum was heard, the drummer would be knocked down, and the drum broke: he added, that probably all the drummers of the regiment were in the mob. Nothing more being to be done, the mob were left to di&s;per&s;e at their own time, which they did about twelve o'clock.&mdash;Whil&s;t I am writing, I &s;aw a bonfire burning on Fort-Hill, by which I under&s;tand the mob is up, and pro|bably doing mi&s;chief; I &s;hall therefore di&s;continue this let|ter till I can receive information of what is done this night.</P>

<P>IN the afternoon of ye&s;terday, &s;everal gentlemen applied to Mr. Oliver, to advi&s;e him to make a public declaration, that he would re&s;ign the office, and never act in it; with|out which they &s;aid his hou&s;e would be immediately de&s;troy|ed, and his life in continual danger: upon which he was obliged to authorize &s;ome gentlemen to declare in public, that he would immediately apply for leave to re&s;ign, and would not act in the office (as indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to do) until he received further orders.</P>

<P>I Come now to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject of my letter, dated the 15^t^h and 16^t^h in&s;tant.&mdash;It is difficult to conceive the fu|ry, which at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the people of Bo&s;ton, of all orders and degrees of men: if a gentleman, in common conver&s;ation, &s;ignifies his di&s;approbation of this in&s;urrection, his per&s;on is immediately in danger. A gentleman having &s;aid, that, notwith&s;tanding what was pa&s;&s;ed, he would ac|cept of the &s;tamp-office, a day was fixed for pulling down his hou&s;e; it was prevented not without difficulty. Ano|ther gentleman having mentioned his expectation, that &s;ome regular forces would be &s;ent into the town, was obliged to make interce&s;&s;ion to prevent his being mobbed. A Mini&s;ter of the church of England, having, in his &s;ermon, obliquely condemned the&s;e proceedings, has been threatened with the re&s;entment of the people. On the other hand, a Mini&s;ter of one of the principal meetings told Mr. Oliver, that though he was &s;orry this mi&s;chief had fell upon him, yet it was a very proper and nece&s;&s;ary proceeding, and he quite approv|ed
<PB N="102" REF="010663_0101_0F81DFB5E2123AA0">of it. Another congregational Mini&s;ter, well known by his late polemical writings, has, as I have been told by &s;e|veral per&s;ons, ju&s;tified this proceeding in his &s;ermon, and prayed for its &s;ucce&s;s: but there are congregational Mini|&s;ters, I doubt not, (and I know &s;ome) who condemn it, but they dare not &s;peak out, which is the ca&s;e of every one who does not approve of it.&mdash;I would not willingly aggravate matters, but I really fear much wor&s;e is to come than is pa&s;&s;ed: the Sheriff of this county, a prudent and re&s;olute man, has told me, that he was applied to by &s;ome friends, who would have per&s;uaded him to re&s;ign his office, for it would &s;oon become dangerous for a civil officer to appear; and that both his deputies at Bo&s;ton had applied to re&s;ign. The fir&s;t of November is appointed for a grand jubilee; when, I &s;uppo&s;e, there will be much mi&s;chief done, and ven|geance wrecked upon tho&s;e who remain friends to govern|ment.</P>

<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t concern, that I am obliged to con|tinue the &s;ubject of my la&s;t, letters of the 15th and 16th, and of the 22d in&s;t. the di&s;orders of the town having been carried to much greater lengths than what I have informed your Lord&s;hips of.</P>
<P>After the demolition of Mr. Oliver's hou&s;e was found &s;o practicable and ea&s;y, that the government was obliged to look on, without being able to take any one &s;tep to prevent it, and the principal people of the town publickly avowed and ju&s;tified the act, the mob, both great and &s;mall, became highly elated, and all kinds of ill-humours were &s;et on foot: every thing that, for years pa&s;t, had been the cau&s;e of any popular di&s;content, was revived; and private re&s;entments again&s;t per&s;ons in office worked them&s;elves in, and endea|voured to exert them&s;elves under the ma&s;k of the public cau&s;e.</P>
<P>On Monday, Augu&s;t 26, there was &s;ome &s;mall rumour, that mi&s;chief would be done that night; but it was in ge|neral di&s;regarded. Towards evening, &s;ome boys began to light a bonfire before the Town-hou&s;e, which is an u&s;ual &s;ignal for a mob. Before it was quite dark, a great com|pany of people gathered together, crying, <HI>Liberty and Pro|perty,</HI> which is their u&s;ual notice of their intention to plunder and pull down an hou&s;e. They went fir&s;t to Mr. Paxton's hou&s;e, who is mar&s;hall of the Court of Admiralty, and &s;urveyor of the port; and finding before it the owner of the hou&s;e (Mr. Paxton being only a tenant) he a&s;&s;ured them, that Mr. Pax|ton
<PB N="103" REF="010663_0102_0F81DFB6A83A9D50">had quitted the hou&s;e with his be&s;t effects, and that the hou&s;e was his; that he had never injured them, and finally, invited them to go to the tavern and drink a barrel of punch: the offer was accepted, and &s;o that hou&s;e was &s;aved. As &s;oon as they had drank the punch, they went to the hou&s;e of Mr. Storey, regi&s;ter-deputy of the Admiralty, broke into it, and broke it all to-pieces, and took out all the books and papers, among which were all the records of the Court of Admiralty, and carried them to the bonfire, and there burnt them: they al&s;o looked about for him with an inten|tion to kill him. From thence they went to Mr. Hallowell's comptroller of the Cu&s;toms, broke into his hou&s;e, and de|&s;troyed and carried off every thing of value, with about 30<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, in ca&s;h. This hou&s;e was lately built by him&s;elf, and fitted and furni&s;hed with great elegance. But the grand mi&s;chief of all was to come.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-governor had been apprized, that there was an evil &s;pirit gone forth again&s;t him; but, being con|&s;cious that he had not in the lea&s;t de&s;erved to be made a party, in regard to the Stamp-act or the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, he re&s;ted in full &s;ecurity that the mob would not attack him; and he was at &s;upper with his family when he received ad|vice that the mob was coming to him. He immediately &s;ent away his children, and determined to &s;tay in the hou&s;e him|&s;elf: but, happily, his elde&s;t daughter returned, and declar|ed &s;he would not &s;tir from the hou&s;e, unle&s;s he went with her; by which means &s;he got him away, which was un|doubtedly the occa&s;ion of &s;aving his life. For, as &s;oon as the mob had got into the hou&s;e, with a mo&s;t irrefutable &s;ury, they immediately looked about for him, to murder him, and even made diligent enquiry whither he was gone. They went to work with a rage &s;carce to be exemplified by the mo&s;t &s;avage people. Every thing moveable was de&s;troyed in the mo&s;t minute manner, except &s;uch things of value as were worth carrying off; among which were near 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, in &s;pecie, be&s;ides a great quantity of family plate, &amp;c. But the lo&s;s to be mo&s;t lamented is, that there was in one room, kept for that purpo&s;e, a large and valuable col|lection of manu&s;cripts and original papers, which he had been gathering all his life-time, and to which all per&s;ons, who had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of valuable papers of a public kind, had been contributing, as to a public Mu&s;eum. As the&s;e related to the hi&s;tory and policy of the country, from the time of its &s;ettlement to the pre&s;ent, and was the only
<PB N="104" REF="010663_0103_0F81DFB75BE21790">collection of its kind, the lo&s;s to the public is great and ir|retrievable, as it is to him&s;elf, the lo&s;s of the papers of a family, which had made a figure in this Province for a hundred and thirty years. As for the hou&s;e, which from its &s;tructure and in&s;ide fini&s;hing, &s;eemed to be from a de&s;ign of Inigo Jones, or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, it appears that they were a long while re&s;olved to level it to the ground: they worked 3 hours at the cupola before they could get it down, and they un|covered part of the roof; but I &s;uppo&s;e, that the thickne&s;s of the walls, which were of very fine brick-work, adorned with Ionic pila&s;ters worked into the wall, prevented their com|pleating their purpo&s;e, though they worked at it till day|light. The next day, the &s;treets were found &s;cattered with money, plate, gold rings, &amp;c. which had been dropt in car|rying off. The whole lo&s;s in this hou&s;e is reckoned at 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling.&mdash;It was now becoming a war of plunder, of general levelling, and taking away the di&s;tinction of rich and poor: &s;o that tho&s;e gentlemen, who had promoted and approved the cruel treatment of Mr. Oliver, became now as fearful for them&s;elves as the mo&s;t loyal per&s;on in the town could be.&mdash;When fir&s;t the town took this new turn, I was in hopes that they would have di&s;avowed all the riotous proceedings; that of the fir&s;t night, as well as the la&s;t. But it is no &s;uch thing, great pains are taken to &s;eparate the two riots; what was done again&s;t Mr. Oliver is &s;till approved of, as a nece&s;&s;ary declaration of their re&s;olution not to &s;ub|mit to the Stamp-act: and even the cruel treatment of him and his family is ju&s;tified by its con&s;equences, the frighten|ing him into a re&s;ignation: and it has been publicly hint|ed, that if a line is not drawn between the fir&s;t riot and the la&s;t, the Civil Power will not be &s;upported by the principal people of the town, as it is a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be now.&mdash;So that the pre&s;ent authority of the Government is only exer|ci&s;ed upon condition, and with pre&s;cribed limitations.</P>

<P>THE late extraordinary and unprecedented preparations in Fort George, and the &s;ecuring the &s;tamped paper in that garri&s;on, having greatly alarmed and di&s;plea&s;ed the inhabitants of this city, a va&s;t number of them a&s;&s;embled
<PB N="105" REF="010663_0104_0F81DFB826EBBAD8">la&s;t Friday evening in the Commons, from whence they marched down the Fly, (preceded by a number of lights) and having &s;topped a few minutes at the coffee-hou&s;e, pro|ceeded to the fort walls; when they broke open the &s;table of the Lieutenant-governor, took out his coach, and, after carrying the &s;ame through the principal &s;treets of the city in triumph, marched to the Commons, where a gallows was erected, at one end of, which was &s;u&s;pended the effigy of the per&s;on who&s;e property the coach was: in his right hand he held a &s;tamped bill of lading, and on his brea&s;t was affixed a paper with the following in&s;cription, <HI>The Rebel Drummer in the Year</HI> 1715; at his back was fixed a drum, the badge of his profe&s;&s;ion; at the other end of the gallows hung the figure of the Devil, a proper companion for the other, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed it was entirely at his in&s;tigation he acted: after they had hung there a con&s;iderable time, they carried the effigies with the gallows entire, being preceded by the coach, in a grand proce&s;&s;ion, to the gate of the fort, where it re|mained for &s;ome time; from whence it was removed to the Bowling-green, under the muzzles of the fort guns, where a bonfire was immediately made, and the Drummer, Devil, Coach, &amp;c. were con&s;umed, amid&s;t the acclamations of &s;ome thou&s;ands of &s;pectators; and, we make no doubt, but the Lieutenant-governor and his friends had the mortification of viewing the whole proceeding from the ramparts of the fort. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of the night not being yet conclud|ed, the whole body proceeded with the greate&s;t decency and good order to Vauxhall, the hou&s;e of major James, who, it was reported, was a friend to the Stamp-act, and had been over officious in his duty, from whence they took every in|dividual article, to a very con&s;iderable amount, and having made another bonfire, the whole was con&s;umed in the flames, to the great &s;atisfaction of every per&s;on pre&s;ent; after which they di&s;per&s;ed, and every man went to his re&s;pective habitation. The whole affair was conducted with &s;uch de|corum, that not the lea&s;t accident happened.</P>
