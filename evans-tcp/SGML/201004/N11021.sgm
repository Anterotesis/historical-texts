<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL begin this letter to your Lord|&s;hip, with an extract of a letter I ad|dre&s;&s;ed &s;ome time &s;ince to Lord Mansfield, becau&s;e I know how exactly your Lord&s;hip's capa|city is fitted to think ju&s;t as he thinks.</P>
<P>To him ob&s;erved;&mdash;to your Lord&s;hip I repeat it.&mdash;</P>
<P>"That in matters of private property we &s;ee the &s;ame bias and inclination to depart from the deci&s;ion of your predece&s;&s;ors, which you certainly
<PB N="74" REF="013971_0002_0F9259F40ADA4260">ought to receive, as evidence of common law; in|&s;tead of tho&s;e certain po&s;itive rules, by which the judgment of a court of law &s;hould invariably be determined, you have fondly introduced your own un&s;ettled notions of equity and &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice. Deci&s;ions given upon &s;uch principles, do not alarm the public &s;o much as they ought, be|cau&s;e the con&s;equence and tendency of each par|ticular in&s;tance is not ob&s;erved, or regarded." But the day is now come, my Lord; the public have taken the alarm; your Lord&s;hip's lawle&s;s de|ci&s;ion, in the court of Chancery, in the cau&s;e of Thickne&s;s and Liege, and the manner in which it was corruptly affirmed, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, has &s;hook the kingdom to its very ba&s;is. Till that fatal day, my Lord, the &s;upreme tribunal of this country &s;tood un-impeached and un-polluted, as to matters of private property; but that was a day in which a deed was done, that even Lord Man&s;|field dur&s;t not become a parti&s;an.</P>
<P>That day, my Lord, was only a grievous day to the appellant, but it will prove a fatal blow to Britain.</P>
<P>When the foundations of ju&s;tice are &s;o corrupt|ed, that the fir&s;t law officer in the kingdom &s;hall dare to &s;tand forth, in the highe&s;t court of judica|ture, knowing that he has a&s;&s;i&s;tant judges, deter|mined to &s;upport him in reading letters containing the opinions of men not judges in that court, in order to affirm a decree un&s;upported by argument, and in direct contradiction to a former and recent judgment of that hou&s;e, the day cannot be very remote, when the nation, the laws, and the violators of them will all be involved in one common ruin.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip is now brought to a greater tri|bunal than even the Hou&s;e of Lords,</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="013971_0003_0F9259F4C2CE1420">
The Tribunal of the PUBLIC.</P>
<P>You &s;tand charged, my Lord, at that awful bar, with &s;etting at defiance tho&s;e laws you were &s;o &s;hamefully appointed to &s;upport, in order to affirm a wicked decree, without law to &s;u&s;tain it, or an argument to give even a colour to &s;hade it. You did it, my Lord, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Buck|hor&s;e Bully Lord Denbigh, who a&s;&s;a&s;inated ju&s;tice, and &s;tifled every idea of honor or humanity; till he had driven every hone&s;t man, but Lord Cam|den, out of the Hou&s;e! He, it is true, was not to be menaced from his duty by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t lan|guage, nor frightened from his po&s;t by the foul|e&s;t fiend who ever appeared in human form.</P>
<P>Are you not afraid, my Lord, to lie down in your bed, knowing, for you do know it, that you have &s;acrificed a whole family to your vanity, and thereby ruined a gentleman, who has eight chil|dren; the elde&s;t of whom is next heir to a &s;eat in that hou&s;e you have &s;o openly di&s;honored, by plundering his father, and family, of their legal property.</P>
<P>I have &s;een, my Lord, a copy of this gentle|man's letter, written to his elde&s;t &s;on, now at Gi|braltar, the day after he was &s;acrificed at the altar of mini&s;terial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In that pathetic letter, my Lord, the highly injured, and deeply afflicted father, after informing his &s;on with the foul doings of your Lord&s;hip, and your wicked coadjutors, adds,</P>
<P>"And now, my dear &s;on, let me call upon you, as your affectionate father, and as your faithful friend (for be a&s;&s;ured I am both) never to enter the Hou&s;e of Lords, without ca&s;ting your eyes about you, and &s;aying, in this hou&s;e my father was
<PB N="76" REF="013971_0004_0F9259F5D43ACD70">defrauded of ten thou&s;and pounds; and if ever you &s;hould be called to &s;it in judgment there, ne|ver take your &s;eat in it, without looking up to hea|ven, and calling upon God, in a &s;hort prayer, to enable you upon every occa&s;ion to dive&s;t your&s;elf of party zeal, all per&s;onal pique, all private re&s;ent|ment, and &s;o to enlighten your mind, and direct your heart, that in all you &s;ay or do, it may be conformable to that godlike precept of doing as you would be done by. If you do not this; then, to God, I offer up this my fervent prayer, that you may never have any voice where ju&s;tice ought to be admini&s;tered."</P>
<P>Can your Lord&s;hip &s;u&s;tain the horrid reflection of the deed you have done? Of that BLACK DAY'S WORK! Can the &s;oothing gentle man|ners of that flattering low born
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is the &s;on of an old cloaths man.</NOTE> Perrin, or the &s;miles of your ob&s;equious Regi&s;ter, divert you from feeling the mo&s;t pungent remor&s;e? Or do they, by telling you, how much they approve your decree, make your pliant mind ea&s;y? My Lord, I know they tell you &s;o; but I will tell you, my Lord, that they dur&s;t not &s;ay &s;o to any lawyer.</P>
<P>There is but one opinion among them, and that is (you &s;hall hear it, my Lord, while Junius can hold a pen, and you the &s;eals) that Lord Man&s;|field &s;ingled your Lord&s;hip out as a vain, weak, and wicked wretch to &s;upport the &s;ame fal&s;e, and un&s;ettled doctrines in the Court of Chancery, which he has &s;o long, and &s;o &s;hamefully practi&s;ed in the Court of King's Bench; and which he has addre&s;s enough to give &s;anction to, even without appearing in per&s;on, to appeals in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>When Lord Camden, with that gentlene&s;s of
<PB N="77" REF="013971_0005_0F9259F7DB2FCEF0">manners, which ever accompanies &s;olid &s;en&s;e, and un&s;haken integrity, told your Lord&s;hip, that no man's opinion, however high his &s;tation, or how|ever great his abilities, if not a judge in that court, could be produced or read, lea&s;t it &s;hould influence any of the Lords in their judgments; you had the boldne&s;s to &s;tand forth, and ca&s;ting down your hat, with which you ought to have hid your face, you per&s;i&s;ted in reading Sir William De Grey's letter, becau&s;e your bully, Lord Denbigh, &s;aid he would read another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, if he had it.</P>
<P>Sir William De Grey's letter was then read by your Lord&s;hip! His opinion, it &s;eems, coincided with the Duke of Chandois's, Lord Denbigh's, and the two Scotch Lords, who &s;at for Lord Mansfield.</P>
<P>By the&s;e worthy Peers, my Lord, and two &s;i|lent Bi&s;hops, your Lord&s;hip's (I mean Sir William De Grey's) decree was affirmed without a divi&s;ion!</P>
<P>The week and feeble efforts of Lord Camden were overpowered by your Lord&s;hip's great abili|ties, and nobly &s;u&s;tained by Lord Denbigh, and your other auxiliary troops.</P>
<P>That Sir William De Grey's detection has pro|duced in him both &s;hame and fear, is very obvious, for he never &s;u&s;pected you would &s;o openly publi&s;h his &s;ecret in&s;tructions, as his letter to the appellant, Thickne&s;s, will clearly evince; and I make no doubt if I can prevail upon your Lord&s;hip to attend to what the world thinks, and to under&s;tand what I &s;ay, you will be equally a&s;hamed; though I confe&s;s not equally criminal with Sir William De Grey. I &s;ay not equally criminal, my Lord, for God for|bid I &s;hould think the crimes of &s;o contemptible a wretch as your Lord&s;hip are equal to tho&s;e of a man as capable of torturing at once the laws,
<PB N="78" REF="013971_0006_0F9259F887444290">and involving them, and a whole family, in one common ruin, as even Lord Mansfield him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of Sir WILLIAM DE GREY's Letter to PHILIP THICKNESS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry that you pre&s;s me &s;o much to &s;peak more explicitly upon the &s;ubject of your letter.</P>
<P>I do not think that I can, with propriety, give an an&s;wer to the que&s;tion you are plea&s;ed to a&s;k me.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 21, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>I am, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant, WILLIAM DE GREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In a former paper (No. VII.) I gave your Lord|&s;hip a copy of Sir William De Grey's fir&s;t preva|ricating letter to the appellant, Thickne&s;s. On that letter I made but one comment. On this I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent, make only one other. Either Sir William De Grey (I will not blot my paper with calling him a Chief-Ju&s;tice) cannot &s;upport Lord Mansfield's decree, and is a&s;hamed to repeat your Lord&s;hip's unmeaning jargon about &s;ub&s;tan|tive gifts, or he has received farther orders.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this letter to your Lord&s;hip, by ob&s;erving that there are &s;till a few people di&s;po&s;ed to think favorably of you, and to impute the black part of this tran&s;action to Sir William De Grey; becau&s;e they confe&s;s the weakne&s;s of your head, and lament, as a national misfortune, that a man of &s;uch contemptible abilities, as your Lord&s;hip's, and at &s;uch a time too, &s;hould di&s;grace the Briti&s;h nation, in holding the highe&s;t law de|partment in it, without talents to acquit your&s;elf with common decency, even in the lowe&s;t; but
<PB N="79" REF="013971_0007_0F9259FD09AD2C40">&s;ome men are &s;till willing to hope your are ho|ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, for their &s;ake, and for your own al&s;o, either an&s;wer the following que&s;tion fairly and openly, or for ever decline holding out lights to dazzel the world with fal&s;e marks of your virtue or integrity. Would the &s;elling a living, to Dr. Dodd, or his buying it of you, have been half &s;o criminal as what you are now charged with?</P>
<P>Did not your late decea&s;ed brother, Mr. Benja|min Bathur&s;t, keep his money, when he had any, at Me&s;&s;rs. Hoare's in Fleet-&s;treet? And did he not frequently over draw on that very re&s;pectable hou&s;e? My Lord he did; you know he did; and did not you, his executor, when you &s;ettled the af|fairs, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his property, refu&s;e to allow that hou&s;e a &s;um of money your nece&s;&s;itous bro|ther had over drawn upon it, under the &s;hameful, &s;hameful, did I &s;ay! under the infamous pretence, that they could not recover it, the time being lap&s;ed!</P>
<P>If this be true, my Lord, and facts you know are ob&s;tinate things, the world will then be as fully &s;atisfied about the rectitude of your heart, as they have always been about the extent of your genius. They will then be of one mind, as to your Lord&s;hip, whatever they think of JUNIUS.</P>
<P>I never yet knew a man perfectly &s;ober, taking pains to convince every man he met, that he was &s;o; but a drunken man is always acting the part of a &s;ober one; when you rung the alarm about Dr. Dodd, I violently &s;u&s;pected you, and &s;oberly &s;et you down for the man all the world will now be|lieve you to be. And therefore I mu&s;t repeat, what I &s;aid before, the nation will no longer bear with you; your Lord&s;hip cannot, after &s;uch foul pro|ceedings, hold the great &s;eal.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="013971_0008_0F9259FE6F7A8698">
Camby&s;es, King of Per&s;ia, finding that his Chief Ju&s;tice, Si&s;amnes, had pronounced an unju&s;t &s;entence, cau&s;ed him to be executed and flayed, and with his &s;kin covered the common &s;eat of ju&s;tice; then con&s;tituted Otanes, his &s;on, judge in his room. He &s;at, my Lord, upon his father's &s;kin, which probably put him in mind of his own: And Perrin will make the application for your Lord&s;hip; and, if he be not a&s;hamed, remind your Lord|&s;hip of the fate of the two time &s;erving judges, Ep&s;om and Dudley, who were hanged in the reign of Henry the Seventh. Of this tran&s;action one of the greate&s;t lawyers, and mo&s;t upright judge this nation ever was ble&s;t with, makes this re|markable epiphonema.</P>
<P>"Qui eorum ve&s;tigus in&s;i&s;tunt, eorum exitus prehorres cant.&mdash;Tho&s;e that dare tread in their &s;teps, let them dread or expect the &s;ame di&s;mal end."</P>
<P>In my next I &s;hall lay before the public &s;ome farther traits of your Lord&s;hip's public and private life, for be a&s;&s;ured I will never drop my attention to you while you continue to hold the &s;eals.</P>
<P>&rindx; The public are de&s;ired to ob&s;erve the cunning of that mo&s;t artful, as well as mo&s;t wicked of men, Lord Mansfield. His Lord&s;hip fir&s;t planned the affirming the decree, made by his Chan|cellor in the above cau&s;e, in order to reak his private vengeance on Thickne&s;s; and then, in a matter in which he was totally indifferent about the i&s;&s;ue, he affects to correct Lords L&mdash;De|&s;pencer, and Denbigh, for interfering in nice points of law. This reprimand was taken in good part, the two Lords were in&s;tanly convinced of their error. They made proper and pub|lic acknowledgment of their ignorance in the tythe cau&s;e, but Lord Denbigh's villany, in the former cau&s;e, is to pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
