<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE following amendment to the bill providing the means of intercour&s;e between the United States and foreign nations, being under con&s;ideration, to wit: In the &s;ection which pro|vides that "the Pre&s;ident &s;hall not allow to any mini&s;ter <HI>plenipotentiary</HI> a greater &s;um than at the rate of nine thou|&s;and dollars per annum, as a compen&s;ation for all his per&s;onal &s;ervices and other expen&s;es; nor a greater &s;um for the &s;ame than four thou&s;and five hundred dollars per annum, to <HI>a charg&eacute; des affaires;"</HI> &s;trike out the word <HI>"plenipoten|tiary,"</HI> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof, the words "to Great-Britain, France or Spain;" &s;trike out the words <HI>"charg&eacute; des affaires,"</HI> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof the words "any mini&s;ter to any other foreign nation."</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE amendment propo&s;ed to this bill fixes the &s;alary of mini&s;ters, employed at foreign courts, not accord|ing to the grade of tho&s;e mini&s;ters, as has heretofore been the ca&s;e, but according to the courts to which they may be &s;ent. Its object is to reduce the diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;h|ment nearly to what it was before May, 1796, by confining the &s;alary of 9000 dollars a-year to the mini&s;ters at Lon|don, Paris and Madrid, and allowing only 4500 to all others. The &s;hape of the bill precludes an amendment more &s;imple in its nature, and by which the &s;ame object would have been attained. The pre&s;ent permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, which the framers of the bill mean to &s;upport, requires an annual appropriation of &s;ixty-four thou&s;and dollars; and yet twenty-four thou&s;and dollars of that &s;um are thrown

<P>Before we are permitted to enter into the merits of the que&s;tion, we are arre&s;ted in the thre&s;hold of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by con&s;titutional objections. It is not indeed in&s;i&s;ted that the amendment it&s;elf is uncon&s;titutional; it is not denied that the legi&s;lature has a right to fix the &s;alaries of public mi|ni&s;ters; but the reduction of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, is &s;uppo&s;ed, in its operation and tendency, to affect the legitimate au|thority of the pre&s;ident. We are charged with a de&s;ign of &s;ubverting, by our doctrine, the principles of the con&s;titu|tion, and we are thus drawn, in an incidental manner, into a previous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a con&s;titutional que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The 2d &s;ection of the 2d article of the con&s;titution, among&s;t other things, provides, that "the pre&s;ident &s;hall nominate, and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, &s;hall appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e appointments are not herein otherwi&s;e provided for, and which &s;hall be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by law." The fir&s;t inference, attempted to be drawn from the clau&s;e, is, not only that the appointment of mini&s;|ters is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the executive, which po&s;ition is &s;elf-evident, but, that an unlimited number of offices of am|ba&s;&s;adors, and other diplomatic agents, is <HI>created</HI> by the con&s;titution it&s;elf, and that the pre&s;ident, in appointing, only fills tho&s;e pre-exi&s;ting offices. It appears to me, that it would be more correct to &s;ay, that the po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence of tho&s;e officers is recognized by that &s;ection, but that the of|fice of mini&s;ter to any foreign court, where we have not had any before, is created by the pre&s;ident making the ap|pointment. And it may even be thought doubtful whether a law may not be nece&s;&s;ary to create the office, before an appointment takes place. This clau&s;e recognizes the exi&s;|tence of judges of the &s;upreme court, as well as that of fo|reign mini&s;ters, and gives the &s;ame unlimited power of ap|pointment in both ca&s;es to the executive. Nay, the ca&s;e of judges is &s;tronger than that of mini&s;ters; for, upon the&s;e, the con&s;titution is &s;ilent in every other part, whil&s;t not only
<PB N="5" REF="033777_0004_0FF937F31A1742A0">it is here declared, that judges of the &s;upreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as well as public mini&s;ters, <HI>may</HI> exi&s;t, but the 3d article o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the con&s;titution po&s;itively enacts, that there <HI>&s;hall be</HI> a &s;u|preme court, and fixes its juri&s;diction. Yet it has not been contended that the office of judges of the &s;upreme court was created by the con&s;titution, or could be created by the mere appointment of the pre&s;ident, without the previous authorization of a law. It has not been contended that the pre&s;ident had, by the con&s;titution, the power of appointing any unlimited number of tho&s;e judges, to be fixed by his own di&s;cretion. On the contrary, a law had pa&s;&s;ed defin|ing their number, before any appointment took place; and it is not in&s;i&s;ted that the executive can appoint more than &s;ix, as fixed by that law. Had that power, contended for in relation to public mini&s;ters, exi&s;ted in the ca&s;e of judges, that part of the law, which declares that there &s;hall be &s;ix judges, and no more, mu&s;t be uncon&s;titutional, as we have no right by law, and even with the con&s;ent of the pre&s;i|dent, to dive&s;t him of any of his con&s;titutional authorities. Still, it is not my intention to lay any &s;tre&s;s upon this ar|gument; &s;ome nice di&s;crimination may perhaps be drawn between the two offices; a different con&s;truction has here|tofore prevailed in the ca&s;e of mini&s;ters, and it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to prove the con&s;titutionality of our doc|trine, to contend for the con&s;truction of this &s;ection. I would not, therefore, have made the&s;e preliminary ob&s;erva|tions, had it not been to &s;how, that the power of the exe|cutive to appoint mini&s;ters without the previous &s;anction of a law, from which it is attempted to derive by implication the right of controuling the legi&s;lature in the exerci&s;e of its own con&s;titutional powers, is it&s;elf of a doubtful nature, and can only be admitted by a very liberal con&s;truction of that clau&s;e of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the con&s;titution his expre&s;sly and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, the power of rai&s;ing, grant|ing, and directing the application of money. The 8th &s;ec|tion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t article declares, that "congre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es, and to borrow money on the credit of the United States." The 1&s;t &s;ection emphatically &s;tates, that "<HI>all legi&s;lative
<PB N="6" REF="033777_0005_0FF937F7609556D0">powers</HI> herein granted &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a congre&s;s;" and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 9th &s;ection provides, that "no money &s;hall be drawn from the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ury, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in con&s;equence of <HI>appropriations made by law.</HI>'</P>
<P>We &s;ay that congre&s;s having the &s;ole power of granting money, are judges of the propriety or impropriety of mak|ing a grant, and that they have a right to exerci&s;e their di&s;|cretion therein; whil&s;t tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the amendment upon con&s;titutional grounds, contend that the power of creating the office of public mini&s;ters, ve&s;ted in the pre&s;i|dent, impo&s;es an obligation upon congre&s;s to provide an adequate compen&s;ation for as many as he &s;hall think fit to appoint. We &s;ay that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power of granting money for any purpo&s;es whatever, belongs &s;olely to the legi&s;lature, in which it is <HI>literally</HI> ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution: they in&s;i&s;t that that power in this in&s;tance attaches, <HI>by implication,</HI> to the pre&s;ident, and that congre&s;s are bound to make provi|&s;ion, without having a right to exerci&s;e their own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>In order to e&s;tabli&s;h this doctrine, it is a&s;&s;erted that, by our con&s;titution, each department may have checks within it&s;elf, but has none upon the others; that each department is &s;elf-independent, has its own &s;hare of powers, and moves uncontrouled within its &s;phere; that, therefore, whenever a certain authority is, by the con&s;titution, ve&s;ted in any one department, it mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the means to carry that authority into effect, and that the other departments are bound to lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e po&s;itions will not &s;tand the te&s;t of inve&s;tigation. Whenever the powers ve&s;ted in any one department are &s;ufficient to complete a certain act, that department is in|dependent of all the others, and it would be an uncon&s;ti|tutional attempt in any of the others to try to controul it. But whenever the powers have been &s;o di&s;tributed between two departments, in relation to another certain act, that neither of the two can complete the act by virtue of its own powers, then each department is controuled by the other, not in relation to the operation of its appropriate powers, but in relation to the act it&s;elf. Each department, in that ca&s;e, may go as far as its own authority will permit, but no farther. The refu&s;al of the other department, to ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="033777_0006_0FF937FD5DE90350">its powers in relation to that act, in the &s;ame direc|tion and in concurrence with the fir&s;t department, is no abridgment of the legitimate powers of the fir&s;t. It is the con&s;titution which, in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ridges the powers of both, and which has rendered the concurrence of both ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the completion of the act. If either of the de|partments, in that ca&s;e, after having exerci&s;ed its own au|thority towards the completion of the act, &s;hall pretend to have a right to force the pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of the other in the &s;ame direction, &s;o as to have the act completed again&s;t or with|out its voluntary con&s;ent, it is that department which abridges the legitimate exerci&s;e of the powers of the other. Thus, in the in&s;tance before us, the pre&s;ident may appoint as many public mini&s;ters as he thinks fit, and if he can &s;end them to their intended mi&s;&s;ion without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any act of the legi&s;lature; if he can, as in the ca&s;e of con&s;uls, find men who will &s;erve without a &s;alary, he has a right to do it, and thus to act uncontrouled by the legi&s;lature; be|cau&s;e, in this &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;tance, his own authority is &s;uffi|cient to carry into effect his intentions. But farther than that he cannot go; for the con&s;titution, in no part, gives him any power to force the legi&s;lature to grant the money which may be nece&s;&s;ary to pay the mini&s;ters. In the &s;ame manner the legi&s;lature have a right to appropriate a &s;um of money, for the purpo&s;e of paying twenty public mini&s;ters, if they &s;hall, in their judgment, think &s;o many nece&s;&s;ary. But farther than that they cannot go; they cannot force the pre&s;ident to appoint twenty mini&s;ters, if he does not think them nece&s;&s;ary. In this in&s;tance, the act is placed partly un|der the juri&s;diction of the executive, and partly under that of the legi&s;lature&mdash;under the juri&s;diction of the executive &s;o far as relates to the creation of the office and to the ap|pointment&mdash;under the juri&s;diction of the legi&s;lature &s;o far as relates to granting the money; and the concurrence of both departments is nece&s;&s;ary to complete the act.</P>
<P>The contrary doctrine leads to a palpable ab&s;urdity; for, if it be true that any department, having expre&s;&s;ed its will in relation to an act, upon which it can operate but par|tially, binds the other departments to lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order that its will may be completely carried into effect,
<PB N="8" REF="033777_0007_0FF938040B9679F8">it follows, that whenever two department &s;hall differ in opinion as to a certain act, we &s;hall have two different wills acting in contrary directions, and each, however, binding the other re&s;pectively; that is to &s;ay, that there is a nece&s;&s;i|ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the act &s;hould at the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e time be done in two dif|ferent ways, or, in &s;ome in&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, that it &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be done and not be done. But the fact is, that the true doctrine of tho&s;e gentlemen, though not openly avowed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, is not, that each depart|ment may act uncontrouled in the exerci&s;e of its own ap|propriate powers; but that they have two &s;tandards, one which they apply to the executive, and another by which they mea&s;ure the powers of the legi&s;lature; and that in their opinion the powers of the executive are paramount, and mu&s;t limit and controul tho&s;e of the legi&s;lature, when|ever they happen to move in the &s;ame &s;phere, whenever the execution of an act depends upon the concurrence of both.</P>
<P>This doctrine is as novel as it is ab&s;urd. We have al|ways been taught to believe that in all mixed governments, and e&s;pecially in our own, the different departments mutu|ally operated as checks one upon the other. It is a prin|ciple inherent to the very nature of tho&s;e governments: it is a principle which flows from the di&s;tribution and &s;epara|tion of legi&s;lative and executive powers, by which the &s;ame act, in many in&s;tances, in&s;tead of belonging exclu&s;ively to either, falls under the di&s;cretionary and partial authority of both: it is a principle of all our &s;tate con&s;titutions: it is a principle of the con&s;titution under which we now act: it is a principle recognized by every author who wrote on the &s;ubject: it is a principle fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the theory and practice of the government of that country, from which we derive our political in&s;titutions. In Great Britain, the power of declaring war is ve&s;ted in the king; but the power of granting &s;upplies, in order to &s;upport the war, is ve&s;ted in parliament. It has never been contended there, that parliament were bound by the act of the king to grant mo|ney for that purpo&s;e; it is, on the contrary, fully under&s;tood that a concurrence of opinion is nece&s;&s;ary, before a war can be carried into effect, that the two departments, in that re|&s;pect, controul and check each other, and that war is never
<PB N="9" REF="033777_0008_0FF93815C7386F38">declared by the king, unle&s;s he can depend on the &s;upport of parliament.</P>
<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> is found that the con&s;titution has di&s;tributed the powers in a manner different from that contended for, although there is no clau&s;e, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s that congre&s;s &s;hall be bound to appropriate money is order to carry into effect any of the executive powers, &s;ome gentlemen, recurring to metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtleties, and abandoning the literal and plain &s;en&s;e of the con&s;titution, &s;ay, that, although we have a <HI>con&s;titutional power,</HI> we have not a <HI>moral right</HI> to act according to our own di&s;cretion, but are under a moral obligation, in this in&s;tance, to grant the money. It is evident, that <HI>where</HI> the con&s;titution has lodged the power, <HI>there</HI> ex|i&s;ts the right of acting and the right of di&s;cretion. Con|gre&s;s is, upon all occa&s;ions, under a moral obligation to act according to ju&s;tice and propriety. We do not claim the ab&s;urd privilege of acting without &s;ufficient motives, but we wi&s;h every proper motive to have its due weight. The opinion of the executive, and, where he has a partial pow|er, the application of that power, to a certain object, will ever operate as powerful motives upon our deliberations. I wi&s;h it to have its full weight; but I feel aver&s;e to a doc|trine which would place us under the &s;ole controul of a &s;in|gle force impelling us in a certain direction, to the exclu|&s;ion of all the other motives of action which &s;hould al&s;o influence us.</P>
<P>The la&s;t clau&s;e of the 8th &s;ection of the 1&s;t article of the con&s;titution, which declares, that <Q>congre&s;s <HI>&s;hall have pow|er</HI> to make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ay and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer there|of,</Q> was introduced ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">day, in order to prove that con|gre&s;s <HI>were bound</HI> to pa&s;s the laws nece&s;&s;ary to carry into exe|cution any of the powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in the pre&s;ident. But it is evident, that this clau&s;e gives a power, and does not impo&s;e duty: it does not &s;ay that congre&s;s <HI>&s;hall make laws,</HI> but <HI>&s;hall have power to make laws;</HI> that is to &s;ay, &s;hall exerci&s;e their own di&s;cretion. This clau&s;e, con|tra&s;ted with the language of the con&s;titution in another part, affords an additional proof in &s;upport of our arguments.</P>

That &s;uch was not the intent of the con&s;titution, appears, from its not u&s;ing, in the la&s;t mentioned clau&s;e, the &s;ame mode of expre&s;&s;ion which is applied to mere executive duties. The 3d &s;ection of the 2d article directs, that <Q>the pre&s;ident <HI>&s;hall take care</HI> that the laws be faithfully <HI>executed.</HI></Q> Here no di&s;cretion is left: the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">tion does not here &s;ay, that the pre&s;ident <HI>&s;hall have power</HI> to execute the laws; but, by the phra&s;eo|logy, he is bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to have them executed. When, there|fore, the con&s;titution means to impo&s;e a duty, it is &s;uffici|ently explicit, and po&s;itively directs the act to be done; and we may &s;afely conclude, that where it gives no &s;uch di|rection, where it impowers in&s;tead of commanding, the rea|&s;on is that it meant to leave a di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o objected that congre&s;s cannot, in every ca&s;e, ex|erci&s;e that di&s;cretion we contend for, as tho&s;e clau&s;es of the con&s;titution which provide "that the pre&s;ident and judges &s;hall rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve, for their &s;ervices, a compen&s;ation, which &s;hall not be dimini&s;hed, &amp;c." would be defeated, by the refu&s;al of the legi&s;lature to appropriate for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution recognizes the exi&s;tence of public mi|ni&s;ters as well as that of the pre&s;ident and judges. It goes no farther on the &s;ubject of mini&s;ters; but declares, that the pre&s;ident and judges &s;hall have &s;alaries, &amp;c. Had the fra|mers of the con&s;titution al&s;o intended that congre&s;s &s;hould be bound to make provi&s;ion for mini&s;ters, they would have introduced a &s;imilar clau&s;e in re&s;pect to them. The con&s;ti+tution is explicit in one ca&s;e, and declares, that &s;alaries &s;hall be given; it is &s;ilent in the other, and does not declare that &s;alaries &s;hall be given. The objection, therefore, cannot reach farther than the &s;pecific ca&s;e upon which it is groun|ded Permit me to add, that in re&s;pect to the pre&s;ident and
<PB N="11" REF="033777_0010_0FF9380C69073450">judges, the di&s;cretionary power of the legi&s;lature to grant money is limited only by the con&s;titution, and is not tran&s;|ferred to any other department. For the number of tho&s;e officers being determined, in re&s;pect to the pre&s;ident by the con&s;titution, and in re&s;pect to the judges by <HI>law,</HI> the amount of money nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport, which mu&s;t be in proportion to their number, is fixed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by the legi&s;lature and not by the executive. The limitation of the legi&s;lative power does not go farther there, than to bind &s;ub&s;equent legi&s;latures for a certain time, by the acts of former ones. But, in re&s;pect to public mini&s;ters, &s;hould the doctrine, again&s;t which we contend, prevail, as their number would be fixed, not by the legi&s;lature, but by the pre&s;ident, the amount of money, nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport, would al&s;o depend upon him; and the power of granting money, in that in&s;tance, would be transferred from the le|gi&s;lature to the executive.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, embarra&s;&s;ed by the clau&s;e re&s;pecting appropriations, have attempted to dimini&s;h its force, by connecting it with the following one, which directs the pub|lication of the accounts of receipts and expenditures of the public money, and repre&s;enting it as a mere matter of form. It is &s;trange indeed that an attempt &s;hould be made to repre|&s;ent appropriation clau&s;es in the con&s;titution as mere mat|ters of form, as nominal provi&s;ions, whil&s;t the only &s;ecu|rity again&s;t &s;tanding armies, contained in the con&s;titution, con&s;i&s;ts in the clau&s;e which provides that <Q>no appropria|tion of money to rai&s;e and &s;upport armies &s;hall be longer than two years.</Q> But the ingenuity of tho&s;e gentlemen cannot era&s;e the obnoxious clau&s;e: and &s;o long as it &s;hall remain a part of the con&s;titution, &s;o long &s;hall it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary that a law be pa&s;&s;ed before any money can be drawn from the trea&s;ury&mdash;&s;o long &s;hall it be nece&s;&s;ary that mo|ney drawn from the trea&s;ury be applied only in &s;uch man|ner, to &s;uch extent, and for &s;uch purpo&s;es, as &s;hall have been previou&s;ly a&s;certained by law. It is this clau&s;e which completes the power ve&s;ted in congre&s;s over money. And it &s;hould be well under&s;tood that the doctrine, for which we contend, is that con&s;titutional principle, which gives to the legi&s;lature an exclu&s;ive authority of rai&s;ing and granting money; an authority which our opponents wi&s;h to place,
<PB N="12" REF="033777_0011_0FF9381ABB8C00D8">in &s;everal ca&s;es, the pre&s;ent one, and that of treaties, in the hands of the executive, allowing him thereby to rai&s;e and to expend money without the controul of congre&s;s. I &s;ay to rai&s;e money; for it is immaterial to me, whether he does it directly, or whether the legi&s;lature are bound to do it according to his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>In this inve&s;tigation, I have confined my&s;elf &s;trictly to the con&s;titutional que&s;tion, wi&s;hing to a&s;certain what the con&s;titution was, and not what it &s;hould be. Before I make any ob&s;ervations on the tendency and con&s;equences of the two oppo&s;ite con&s;tructions, I wi&s;h to make &s;ome on the me|rits of the amendment it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We conceive that the effect of the amendment will be, to prevent an exten&s;ion of our political connections with fo|reign nations, at the &s;ame time that it will reduce any e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en|diture of money, which, if unnece&s;&s;ary, may be applied to give an undue influence to the executive, through the means of patronage, even over the legi&s;lature. But, we do not believe that this amendment will injure our commer|cial intercour&s;e with tho&s;e nations, or cau&s;e any prejudice to our commercial intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The commercial intercour&s;e between nations is regula|ted by the law of nations, by the municipal laws of the re|&s;pective countries, and by treaties of commerce. The ap|plication of tho&s;e different laws to individual ca&s;es, the protection of individuals again&s;t acts of oppre&s;&s;ion not con|&s;onant with tho&s;e laws, the protection of our &s;eamen and of our citizens trading to foreign countries, fall within the province of tho&s;e agents known by the name of con&s;uls. Con&s;uls are appointed for that &s;pecific purpo&s;e: we have them in all countries with which we trade, whether we have there public mini&s;ters or not; they protect our com|merce as effectually at Hamburgh, in Denmark or Swe|den, where we have no diplomatic characters, as it is pro|tected in Spain or Holland, where we have mini&s;ters. It is only when we wi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o obtain a change in the regulations provided by the acknowledged law of nations, or by the municipal laws of the country, that public mini&s;ters are nece&s;&s;ary, as they alone can negociate with a foreign go|vernment, as they alone can form treaties of commerce. But it is only the application of laws and treaties to indi|vidual
<PB N="13" REF="033777_0012_0FF9382646F04690">ca&s;es which require a continual attention and a per|manent re&s;idence. The extraordinary occa&s;ions on which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to negociate treaties, may be provided for by &s;pecial mi&s;&s;ions, by extraordinary envoys; and it is worthy of remark, that the two only treaties, which have yet been made, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, with foreign nations, tho&s;e with Great-Britain and Spain, have both been formed by extraordinary envoys (Mr. Jay and Mr. Pinckney) although we had at that time public mini&s;ters at tho&s;e two courts. The propo&s;ed amendment affects only the permanent diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment; it applies neither to con&s;uls, nor to &s;uch extraordinary mi&s;&s;ions as circum|&s;tances may render nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, that it is not impro|bable that the extention of our diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment may tend to increa&s;e the number of our commercial treaties beyond tho&s;e which might re&s;ult from extraordinary mi&s;|&s;ions. But is this a definable object? It would, indeed, be extremely advantageous to obtain from all nations, &s;uch ge|neral alterations in the law of nations, as would &s;ecure the freedom of the &s;ea, and effectually protect the flag of neu|tral powers, again&s;t the danger of capture or detention in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es. But have we yet ever formed a commer|cial trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, in which tho&s;e provi&s;ions were not connected with &s;ome commercial re&s;trictions of a different nature, and which did not even contain &s;ome clau&s;es of a politi|cal nature? I will go farther, and I will a&s;k, whether we have derived any commercial advantage from the commer|cial treaties we have heretofore made? Let me remind gentlemen on this floor, with the &s;ituation of our commerce before the organization of this government. The treaties of commerce we had at that time with France, Holland, Sweden and Pru&s;&s;ia, had not prevented its depre&s;&s;ion. And to what cau&s;e mu&s;t we a&s;cribe the vigour it had ac|quired before the pre&s;ent European war? Not to com|mercial treaties; for we had formed no new ones. To the want of a general government, having a power of mak|ing general commercial regulations, was due, the languid &s;ituation of our trade; and its revival was owing to the adoption of that government, to our own regulations, to our&s;elves, and not to any compact made with foreign na|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033777_0013_0FF93832D6A0EC48">
The re&s;trictions which we have laid upon our&s;elves, by our commercial treaties, have been attended with political con&s;equences fatal to our tranquility. We had made two treaties with France, one of alliance avowedly of a politi|cal nature, another of commerce unconnected with the fir&s;t. I need not remind the hou&s;e of the difficulties in which we have been involved by &s;everal clau&s;es of the commercial treaty. The articles relative to the admi&s;&s;ion of prizes of one nation into our ports, and to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e of ano|ther, were the cau&s;e of long and critical diplomatic di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions. We have now extended to the other belligerent pow|er the &s;ame clau&s;es, with a re&s;ervation of our prior en|gagements, but to the exclu&s;ion of nations with whom we had no treaties, and have not thereby le&s;&s;ened our difficul|ties.</P>
<P>But I will again a&s;k, what commercial advantage have we derived from our commercial treaty with France, which we would not have enjoyed without that treaty? Have we derived any from the commercial part of our treaty with Great Britain? Is our commerce with that nation on a bet|ter footing than it was without the treaty. I do not mean to allude to the conventional part of that treaty, by which our differences were arranged. I do not mean to allude to the political con&s;equences of that treaty: they are foreign to the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I &s;peak only of commercial ad|vantages. All we know on that &s;ubject is contained in the two acts of parliament communicated to us by the pre|&s;ident. It re&s;ults from them, that England has opened the Ea&s;t-India trade to us under the re&s;trictions provided by the treaty, and to all neutral nations without tho&s;e re&s;trictions. Whether &s;he means to include us in the general provi&s;ion, which relates to all neutral nations, or to keep us under the treaty re&s;trictions, I will not pretend to &s;ay, and it is not material to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. But it is evident, that we are placed, by the treaty, in a wor&s;e commercial &s;ituation, in re&s;pect to the Ea&s;t Indies, than we were, in fact, before the treaty, or than we might be by the &s;ole effect of the municipal laws of Great-Britain. It al&s;o appears by that act of parliament, that England has laid a countervailing duty on our imports there in American ve&s;&s;els. This they had a right to do without the treaty; but they had not at|tempted
<PB N="15" REF="033777_0014_0FF9382A773502C8">to do it until the treaty took place, becau&s;e we had till then the natural right of defeating that mea&s;ure, by our own regulations here. We have abandoned that right by the treaty; we have, in order to obtain &s;ome &s;up|po&s;ed commercial advantages, laid a re&s;triction upon our natural power of making our own general commercial re|gulations. This act of parliament, however, is the only effect, in relation to commerce, which has as yet re&s;ulted from the treaty. What its con&s;equences upon our trade may be, I cannot judge; but it places us preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation in which we were before the year 1789, when we had no efficient general government, when we could not make commercial regulations of a general nature. If the commercial part of our former treaties has not been atten|ded with any beneficial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;equences; if, on the contrary, it has involved us in a critical &s;ituation, we may be per|mitted to doubt, whether commercial treaties are not as likely to check as to protect our commerce.</P>
<P>It is not denied that an exten&s;ion of our political con|nections with Europe would be injurious to us; but it is &s;aid, that our having no mini&s;ters in foreign countries will not prevent foreign nations &s;ending their mini&s;ters here, and that our mini&s;ters abroad will not increa&s;e our political foreign connections. I do not mean to make any per&s;onal allu&s;ions to the conduct of our mini&s;ters in Europe; but we may judge&mdash;from pa&s;t events, we may judge from the conduct of foreign mini&s;ters here, that diplomatic charac|ters are not likely to be inactive. From the nature of their appointment, from the nature of man, we know that they will try to acquire importance with their own government and credit to them&s;elves; they are placed in a dangerous vortex, and they will all, more or le&s;s, according to circum|&s;tances and to their per&s;onal character, take a part in the political intrigues or quarrels of Europe; they will attempt to do &s;omething&mdash;they will attempt to involve us in the po|litical vortex of Europe&mdash;they will try to make for us new connections, or to break ancient connections.</P>
<P>Whether foreign nations, with whom we have no public mini&s;ters, will &s;end mini&s;ters here, cannot be ab&s;olutely foretold, but we know that it is not u&s;ual; at all events, it cannot be wi&s;e to invite a greater number of foreign mini|&s;ters
<PB N="16" REF="033777_0015_0FF9383C71E9D500">here, by extending our diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment to countries where we have not heretofore &s;ent mini&s;ters. The amendment under con&s;ideration has no tendency to annihilate that e&s;tabli&s;hment, but it will effectually check its exten&s;ion. If our mini&s;ters abroad are nece&s;&s;ary for the protection of our commerce, or on account of our politi|cal &s;ituation in re&s;pect to the belligerent powers, this amendment will not withdraw their compen&s;ation. Its avowed object, its only po&s;&s;ible effect, is, to reduce the e&s;|tabli&s;hment to what it was in 1796, when we had no mini|&s;ter at Berlin, and when our mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon, with a &s;a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry of 4500 dollars, rendered us the &s;ame &s;ervices as if he had had 9000.</P>
<P>But, we are told, that this is not the time to make a reduc|tion, that our &s;ituation in re&s;pect to Europe forbids it, and that our differing in opinion with the Pre&s;ident on this &s;ubject, will prove us to be a divided people. I am much afraid, that if now is not the time, it will be with this re|form as with all others, it will never be time. To evince to European nations that we wi&s;h not to mix in their political &s;phere of action, that we are not de&s;irous of forming poli|tical connections, that we wi&s;h not to interfere, e&s;pecially at this time, with their political intere&s;ts, is, in my opinion, the be&s;t mode in our power to prevent their interfering with us, and the mo&s;t likely to produce a termination of our pre&s;ent di&s;pute. Nor can I conceive how our expre&s;&s;ing on this ground, a difference of opinion with the executive, will tend to prove that we are not united on the &s;ubject of &s;elf-defence. But I believe that now is the time to expre&s;s our opinion, becau&s;e the object of the exten&s;ion of our di|plomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment having been explained to us by the Pre&s;ident, it is our duty, if we think the object contempla|ted to be dangerous, not to be &s;ilent upon this occa&s;ion. Our information is derived from the following paragraph of the Pre&s;iden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;peech at the opening of the la&s;t extraor|dinary &s;e&s;&s;ion of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;s:</P>

However we may con&s;ider our&s;elves, the maritime and commercial powers of the world will con&s;ider the Uni|ted States of America <HI>as forming a weight in that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or ne|glected.</HI> It would not only be again&s;t our intere&s;t, but it would be doing wrong to one half of Europe at lea&s;t, if we &s;hould voluntarily throw our&s;elves into either &s;cale. <HI>It is a natural policy</HI> for a nation that &s;tudies to be neu|tral, <HI>to con&s;ult with other nations engaged in the &s;ame &s;tu|dies and pur&s;uits:</HI> At the &s;ame time that <HI>mea&s;ures ought to be pur&s;ued with this view,</HI> our treaties with Pru&s;&s;ia and Sweden, one of which is expired, and the other near expiring, might be renewed.</Q></P>
<P>Permit me, before I proceed to make any remarks upon that part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, to contra&s;t it with the &s;entiments contained in the late Pre&s;ident's addre&s;s to the people, on his retiring from office.</P>
<Q><P>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.&mdash;<HI>Here let us &s;top.</HI></P>
<P>Europe has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to <HI>us</HI> have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in frequent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it mu&s;t be <HI>unwi&s;e</HI> in us to implicate our&s;elves, <HI>by artificial ties,</HI> in the ordinary vici&s;&s;itudes of her poli|tics, or the ordinary combinations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities.</P>
<P>Our detached and di&s;tant &s;ituation, invites and enables us to pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e. If we remain one peo|ple, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from exter|nal annoyance..... Why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;ituation? <HI>Why quit our own to &s;tand upon foreign ground?</HI> Why, by <HI>interweaving our de&s;tiny</HI> with
<PB N="18" REF="033777_0017_0FF93848DCDF53B0">that of any part of Europe, <HI>entangle our peace</HI> and pro&s;|perity in the toil of European ambition, rivalship, in|tere&s;t, humour, or caprice? 'Tis our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world, &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it.... Let tho&s;e engagements be ob&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But, in my opinion, it is <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary and would be unwi&s;e to extend them.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Supported by this authority, may I hope to e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of arrogance, if, on this occa&s;ion, I dare expre&s;s an opinion in &s;ome degree oppo&s;ed to the very re&s;pectable au|thority of the pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>The object of both the late and the pre&s;ent pre&s;ident is perfectly the &s;ame; it is that we may not be involved in the political &s;y&s;tem of Europe, that we may not be drawn into the vortex. But they do not &s;eem altogether to agree on the means by which to obtain that object.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident of the United States conceives that it is a natural policy for us to <HI>con&s;ult</HI> with other nations engag|ed in the &s;ame &s;tudies and pur&s;uits; and that <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> ought to be <HI>pur&s;ued</HI> with this view. The late Pre&s;ident thinks it unwi&s;e, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with Europe, to en|tangle our peace&mdash;unwi&s;e to implicate our&s;elves by artifi|cial ties&mdash;unwi&s;e and unnece&s;&s;ary to extend our engage|ments. His opinion is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e words, <HI>"Here let us &s;top."</HI></P>
<P>As to that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or neglected, it is a &s;y&s;tem, which, &s;o far as relates to Europe it&s;elf, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for us to di&s;|cu&s;s. And yet, without examining all the u&s;ele&s;s wars to which it has &s;erved as a cau&s;e or a pretence, we mu&s;t recol|lect, at what late period the Briti&s;h mini&s;try wanted to in|volve the Briti&s;h nation into a war with Ru&s;&s;ia, for the pur|po&s;e of pre&s;erving that balance, which might, in their opi|nion, be affected by the transfer or Oczackow, &s;ituated as it is in a remote corner of the black &s;ea, from the hords of Tartars which rule Turkey, to the Tartar hords which inha|bit Ru&s;&s;ia. But, however intere&s;ting that balance may be to Europe, how does it concern us? We may lament the fate of Poland and Venice, and I never can my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee, without regret, independent nations blotted from the map
<PB N="19" REF="033777_0018_0FF9385D39B46A48">of the world. But their de&s;tiny does not affect us in the lea&s;t. We have no intere&s;t whatever in that balance; and by us, it &s;hould be altogether forgotten and neglected. If we ever think we have an intere&s;t in it, &s;hall we not be indu|ced to throw our weight in the &s;cale.&mdash;&s;hall we not involve our&s;elves in the de&s;tinies and the wars of Europe? If we act on our own ground, is it likely that other nations will ever con&s;ider us as forming a weight in their balance?</P>
<P>But if we adopt the policy to <HI>con&s;ult</HI> with other nations&mdash;if mea&s;ures are to be pur&s;ued with that view&mdash;if we are to form new foreign political connections; how can we hope to e&s;cape being unavoidably drawn into the vortex? It was, after having thus communicated his intention&mdash;it was in pur&s;uance of that plan, that the pre&s;ident thought fit to &s;end a mini&s;ter to Berlin. With Pru&s;&s;ia, we have no com|merce. Had commerce been the object of that emba&s;&s;y, Sweden, Denmark, the Han&s;e-towns, or Italy, would have been preferred. The mi&s;&s;ion is avowedly and evidently of a political nature; and if we are to con&s;ult and to form con|nections with nations, who may, in our opinion, be engaged in &s;imilar pur&s;uits with our&s;elves; if Pru&s;&s;ia is con&s;idered as &s;uch, with what nation in Europe, may we not and &s;hall we not, according to circum&s;tances, con&s;ult, concert mea|&s;ures, and form political arrangements? It is from this view of the &s;ubject, that I have been induced, however reluctantly, fully to &s;tate all the rea&s;ons which impre&s;s upon my mind a conviction of the importance of the pre&s;ent amendment, of the importance of checking at this time, and in its birth, a &s;y&s;tem which tends to increa&s;e our political connections with Europe.</P>
<P>So much has already been &s;aid on the &s;ubject of patron|age, on the danger which might hereafter re&s;ult from an influence obtained through tho&s;e means over the legi&s;lature, and on the &s;y&s;tem, &s;aid to be adopted by the admini&s;tration, to exclude, from every de&s;cription of office, men who do not &s;ub&s;cribe to a certain political creed, that I think it u&s;e|le&s;s to add any ob&s;ervations on that &s;ubject. As, however, the patronage, now ve&s;ted by law in the executive, has been &s;tated as very in&s;ignificant, I will merely &s;tate its real extent.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts in appointment to offices and in the di&s;po&s;al of public monies by contracts. The annual pay of the officers
<PB N="20" REF="033777_0019_0FF93865C25BBAB0">in the different departments of the trea&s;ury, of &s;tate and of war, and all the &s;ubordinate offices of loans, mint, &amp;c. of the officers in the North We&s;t Territory, of the attorney-general, &s;urveyor-general, Indian-agents, diplomatic cha|racters, agents for the protection of &s;eamen, agents and commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by virtue of certain treaties; in fine, the pay of all civil officers, who&s;e appointment depends upon the executive or &s;ome branch of the admini&s;tration, including therein all the clerks, but excluding the judici|ary department, added to the pay and other emoluments of the commi&s;&s;ioned officers of the army and navy, forms an aggregate of about 420,000 dollars. The &s;alary and other emoluments of the officers employed in the collection of the impo&s;t and of the internal revenues, including therein po&s;t-ma&s;ters, amount to about 430,000 dollars. The&s;e two &s;ums amount together to 850,000 dollars yearly, received by officers who derive their appointment from the executive.</P>
<P>The amount of monies di&s;po&s;ed of by contracts, and it is well known that lucrative contracts may be made a pow|erful engine of influence; that amount calculated on &s;ome objects upon an average of three years, and including tho&s;e relative to the mint, to the printing of the &s;everal offices, to the printing of the laws, tho&s;e for the tran&s;portation of the mail, for &s;upplying the provi&s;ions, clothing, hor&s;es, medicines, cannons, arms, of the army, for Indian goods, and all the immen&s;e details of the quarter-ma&s;ter's depart|ment, for building and furni&s;hing all the &s;upplies of the navy, for building light-hou&s;es, and for &s;everal other con|tingent expences, exceeds 1,200,000 dollars a year.</P>
<P>The aggregate of the two &s;ums exceeds 2,000,000 dol|lars, a &s;um by no means de&s;picable, when compared with our population and wealth, when compared with a revenue which till la&s;t year never exceeded &s;even millions of dollars.</P>
<P>After having &s;tated the&s;e con&s;iderations, which appear to me immediately applicable to the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I would not encroach any longer on the patience of the com|mittee, had not &s;ome gentlemen brought into view a num|ber of topics of a more general nature, in which, it may not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s to follow them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t po&s;ition they a&s;&s;ume is, that there is a natural tendency in the legi&s;lative department to encroach upon
<PB N="21" REF="033777_0020_0FF938531F2E2998">the executive, and they attempt to prove, by hi&s;torical facts, that in all countries, where a republican form of govern|ment ever exi&s;ted, the executive has in fact been &s;wallowed up by the legi&s;lature. The in&s;tance of the Greek republics and their &s;ubver&s;ion by Philip of Macedon, and that of Rome, have chiefly been in&s;i&s;ted upon. Both are altoge|ther inapplicable to the American con&s;titution. The que&s;|tion is not, whether governments, con&s;tructed on different principles from ours, have been de&s;troyed by the effect of tho&s;e principles, but, whether the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e &s;imilar to our own will &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion?</P>
<P>The &s;mall Greek republics, Athens e&s;pecially, were go|verned directly and immediately by the people them&s;elves. In Rome, where the con&s;titution, though imperfectly, was better balanced, the popular branch of government was al|&s;o an a&s;&s;embly of the whole people of the city; and when their virtues and their manners, which could alone &s;upport &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, had been corrupted by the &s;poils of a con|quered world&mdash;when the dregs of every other town of Italy, admitted to the rights of citizen&s;hip, had re&s;orted to a cor|rupt metropolis&mdash;when a few citizens, enriched by the trea|&s;ures of A&s;ia, had it in their power to bribe that mixed ma&s;s, which, alone, and without being controlled by the other parts of an exten&s;ive empire, di&s;po&s;ed of every office of honor or power&mdash;when the&s;e offices, thus obtained, placed ambitious leaders at the head of the &s;tanding armies, which con&s;tituted, at that time, the &s;ole military force of the na|tion; we cannot be at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of the civil wars and conte&s;ts for power which terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances are inapplicable to our own &s;ituation, becau&s;e tho&s;e governments e&s;&s;entially differed from that of America; in that, that the legi&s;lative power was there lodg|ed in the people re&s;iding in a &s;ingle city, and that it is here ve&s;ted in the repre&s;entatives of the whole people. <HI>There,</HI> not only there was no proper or preci&s;e di&s;tribution of pow|ers; but <HI>there</HI> al&s;o the people them&s;elves had the authority of deliberating and of enacting laws, and <HI>here</HI> they have only that of electing the per&s;ons who are to make laws for them. All that can be proved by this, is, that power ought not to be ve&s;ted in the body of the people. But, becau&s;e the
<PB N="22" REF="033777_0021_0FF938723864EB90">heterogeneous ma&s;s, which con&s;tituted the body of the citi|zens in Rome, abu&s;ed the power they had, ought we to conclude that the people of America will abu&s;e the power they have not? Or, that becau&s;e a government, where the principle of repre&s;entation was unknown, was de&s;troyed by the corruption of the people, and the ambition of their de|magogues, the repre&s;entative government of the United States will be de&s;troyed by the repre&s;entatives them&s;elves? The hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ancient republics may indeed teach us to cheri&s;h that principle of repre&s;entation, which is the leading feature of our con&s;titution and the &s;afeguard of our liberties. It may teach us another le&s;&s;on applicable to all times and to all men; that money accumulated in the hands of a &s;ingle man, or of a few, may be applied with &s;ucce&s;s to the de&s;truction of any government. The foreign gold of Philip gave the la&s;t blow to the expiring liberty of Athens. And the &s;ame engine in the hands of the citizens of Rome was not attended with le&s;s fatal effects.</P>
<P>But if we turn our attention from a view of ob&s;cure anti|quity, to modern Europe, how &s;hall the a&s;&s;ertion be &s;upported, that, in repre&s;entative governments, the legi&s;lature u&s;ually &s;wallows up the executive? Hi&s;tory tells us, that, three centu|ries ago, repre&s;entative forms of government exi&s;ted through|out Europe, in which the repre&s;entatives of the people, or of a part of the people, had more or le&s;s power and influence, according to the various circum&s;tances under which they re&s;pectively aro&s;e. But, if we look at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of that country, &s;uch at lea&s;t as it was before the French re|volution, where can we di&s;cover traces of tho&s;e in&s;titutions? What has become of the Cortes of Spain? of the States General of France? Of the Diets of Denmark? Every where we find the executive in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of legi&s;lative, of ab&s;olute powers. The glimmerings of liberty, which for a moment &s;hone in Europe, were owing to a decay of the feudal &s;y&s;tem. When the princes were deprived of the per|&s;onal &s;ervices of their va&s;&s;als and of the revenues derived from their ancient domains; when indu&s;try and commerce rendered money the principal engine of power; tho&s;e po|pular a&s;&s;emblies which had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l-then unimportant right of rai&s;ing taxes and granting &s;upplies, aro&s;e, at once, into con&s;equence. And as the executive, either by force, or by
<PB N="23" REF="033777_0022_0FF938772CCDBDE8">fraud, or by the folly of the people them&s;elves, &s;ucceeded in wre&s;ting that power from them, they fell again into mi&s;|u&s;e or in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>The fate of the European republics would lead us to &s;imilar conclu&s;ions. Venice, the greater part of Switzer|land and Holland, would &s;hew us the legi&s;lative powers equally merging into the executive, and a &s;elf-created council or hereditary Stadtholder u&s;urping, by artifice, the legitimate authority of the repre&s;entative bodies. Almo&s;t every ve&s;tige of liberty was era&s;ed from the continent of Europe; and it is to England that we are indebted for the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e principles, which from the ba&s;is of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is from England that we have borrowed our political in&s;titutions. Taught by her example, we have improved them, and adapted them to our own &s;ituation; but her hi&s;to|ry is &s;till that which is mo&s;t applicable to our&s;elves; for, notwith&s;tanding the happy modifications which we have introduced, the great outlines of repre&s;entation, and di&s;tri|bution of powers, are the &s;ame; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong di&s;tingui&s;hing features, there has never exi&s;ted a go|vernment more &s;imilar, upon the whole, to our own, than that of that country.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, leaving out of view that period in the Briti&s;h, hi&s;tory, which &s;hould naturally attract our attention, have attempted to draw from the events of the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, a proof of their favorite doctrine, the dan|ger to be apprehended from the encroachments of the legi&s;|lature. They have forgotten that tho&s;e events were not the effect of the &s;low progre&s;s of an e&s;tabli&s;hed government, but the re&s;ult of an un&s;ettled con&s;titution. The preci&s;e boundaries of power were not a&s;certained; parliament con|tended for the acquirement of rights which had been u&s;urped or enjoyed by the kings. In its beginning, the con|te&s;t was between the king in his own right and parliament in the right of the people. Convul&s;ions, a civil war, a re|volution en&s;ued. But the po&s;ition, which we controvert, is not that the people, or a popular a&s;&s;embly, may, by a con|vul&s;ion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;t, from the executive, powers originally ob|tained by fraud or violence. It is that, when a repre&s;enta|tive government, with properly di&s;tributed powers, is once
<PB N="24" REF="033777_0023_0FF9387FA3373E58">e&s;tabli&s;hed, the legi&s;lature will finally encroach upon the executive. This po&s;ition cannot be illu&s;trated by the events of Charles's reign; but that period, which extends from the revolution of 1688 to the pre&s;ent reign, after the con|&s;titution had been &s;ettled and a&s;certained, is that to which we mu&s;t recur as immediately applicable to our own &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>It is during that period that a progre&s;&s;ing patronage, and a &s;y&s;tematic, corrupting influence have &s;unk parlia|ment to a nominal repre&s;entation, a mere machine, the con|venience u&s;ed by government for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing &s;upplies: the medium through which the executive reach, with ea&s;e, the pur&s;e of the people. And now, when the farce of obtaining even the nominal con&s;ent of parliament is &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, the mini&s;try di&s;pen&s;e with the ce|remony, and have carried &s;o far their contempt for that body, that the &s;um &s;pent during la&s;t year, without the con|&s;ent, exceeds the amount &s;pent with the con&s;ent of parlia|ment. The executive, there, have acquired the unlimited and uncontrouled power of rai&s;ing and expending money, and the hou&s;e of commons is under a <HI>moral</HI> obligation of making the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations.</P>
<P>But, is it to be apprehended, from the &s;tructure of our own con&s;titution, that the executive will be de&s;troyed by the legi&s;lature? The legi&s;lative powers, ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, &s;eem to have been given under &s;uch efficient checks, as &s;hould remove any fears of that nature. They are not given to a &s;ingle popular branch, but to two di&s;tinct bodies.&mdash;The con&s;ent of both is nece&s;&s;ary to do any act, and one of them, elected not immediately by the people, but through the medium of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, is, at the &s;ame time, united with the executive in the exerci&s;e of its mo&s;t impor|tant powers, that of appointing to offices, and that of mak|ing treaties. Thus, no encroachment can be made upon the executive powers, without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate; and this body never will give their a&s;&s;ent to any act, which, by weakening the executive, would nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h their own authority. But, &s;hould ever &s;uch an act pa&s;s both hou&s;es of congre&s;s, it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that the con|&s;titution has ve&s;ted the pre&s;ident with a modified negative. That negative, already twice exerci&s;ed, was, on both occa|&s;ions,
<PB N="25" REF="033777_0024_0FF938864C405270">effectual; and, it is an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition, that, at any time, the pre&s;ident &s;hould not be &s;upported, by at lea&s;t one third of one of the two branches of the legi&s;lature, agean&s;t any uncon&s;titutional attempt to deprive him of his legiti|mate authority.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;titutional barriers, may be added, in re|&s;pect to any &s;uppo&s;ed encroachments of this hou&s;e, the grea|ter degree of permanency in the &s;enate and pre&s;ident, and the &s;y&s;tematic line of conduct, which a &s;ingle magi&s;trate, who&s;e powers are always in action, and a permanent body, who, like the &s;enate, are only renewed by thirds, are ena|bled to pur&s;ue; contra&s;ted with the in&s;ulated efforts of this hou&s;e, liable to a total renovation every two years, and com|po&s;ed of members occa&s;ionally in &s;e&s;&s;ion, but di&s;per&s;ed, through this exten&s;ive country, the greater part of the year. Nor &s;hould the gentlemen, who attach &s;o great a degree of influence to the &s;uppo&s;ed popularity of this hou&s;e, forget, that to us belongs the mo&s;t obnoxious &s;hare of government, that of laying taxes, whil&s;t the executive enjoys the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e grateful employment of the individual application of the public money.</P>
<P>The object of our con&s;titution has been, to divide and di&s;tribute the powers between the &s;everal branches of go|vernment. With that di&s;tribution, and with the &s;hare allo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted to us, we are fully &s;atisfied. We only wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the equilibrium intended by the con&s;titution.&mdash;The con&s;titu|tional right, which is the &s;ubject of this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, is of a ne|gative kind. By this exerci&s;e, we may prevent, but we can|not act; nor is there any power, claimed by us, which does not equally attach to the &s;enate, and lays us under their con|trol. In this in&s;tance, we a&s;k only, that the powers, which the con&s;titution has &s;eparated, may not be blended; that the power of rai&s;ing and granting money may remain invi|olate in they legi&s;lature, and that of appointing to offices, or even, in the ca&s;e of public mini&s;ters, of creating offices, in the executive. But the doctrine, introduced by &s;ome gen|tlemen, tends, in its immediate effects, to blend tho&s;e pow|ers, and by ve&s;ting that legi&s;lative authority&punc; which they repre&s;ent as &s;o formidable, in the &s;ame hands where the exe|cutive power is lodged, to over&s;et every barrier and to de|&s;troy the mo&s;t fundamental principles of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="033777_0025_0FF8C9F32C79CDA0">
In the &s;ame manner, as in this in&s;tance, they in&s;i&s;t that we are bound to appropriate, they, in the ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> treaties, al&s;o claim for the executive, a power of abridging the con|&s;titutional authority of congre&s;s of rai&s;ing and granting money, and ve&s;t in that department what they take from this. Nor do they &s;top there. The mo&s;t important powers entru&s;ted to congre&s;s, exclu&s;ively of that over money, con|&s;i&s;t in regulating; commerce, rai&s;ing armies, providing a navy, and declaring war. And all the&s;e are &s;wept away, and tran&s;ferred to the executive, by the con&s;truction put upon the treaty-making power, which re&s;ts on the &s;ame foundation with that which is now claimed. The executive has the power of appointing public mini&s;ters, of making commercial treaties, of making &s;ub&s;idiary treaties, of mak|ing treaties of alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive. The &s;ame principle which &s;hould bind us in one ca&s;e, binds us in every other. If we are under a moral obligation to lend our a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, in order to carry into effect the con&s;titutional powers of the executive; if we have no di&s;cretion left in the exer|ci&s;e of our own; if it be not true, that when an act, in order to be completed, requires the concurrence of two depart|ments, each department has an equal right to give or to re|fu&s;e its a&s;&s;ent; if, in the in&s;tance of public mini&s;ters, we are bound to appropriate; if, in the in&s;tance of commercial treaties, we are bound to repeal or to make commercial regulations, in conformity with the provi&s;ions of the trea|ties, the inference is unavoidable, that where the executive has formed a &s;ub&s;idiary treaty, we are al&s;o bound, without any di&s;cretion being left to us, to appropriate the &s;ums of money nece&s;&s;ary to pay the &s;ub&s;idy, to rai&s;e the required number of auxiliary troops, and to provide the &s;tipulated number of &s;hips of war; that where a treaty of alliance offen&s;ive has been made, we are under a moral obligation to make war. Thus would the important powers entru&s;ted to congre&s;s by the con&s;titution, be reduced to tho&s;e of coining money, pa&s;&s;ing penal lays, granting patents, and e&s;tabli&s;hing po&s;t-roads. The rule of con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uction which, in one in&s;tance, ve&s;ts in the executive the power of granting money, or any other legi&s;lative authority, makes the transfer in all the ca&s;es I have enumerated.

Can any fatal con&s;equences attend the full exerci&s;e of the con&s;titutional di&s;cretion of congre&s;s, in granting mo|ney? Its general effect mu&s;t be, to dimini&s;h the expendi|ture of public money. By re&s;training it, you take away the mo&s;t efficient check, provided by the con&s;titution, to controul and to keep within proper bounds that expendi|ture. Thus, applied to the pre&s;ent amendment, the exer|ci&s;e of that di&s;cretion, may prevent too large a &s;um of mo|ney being applied to the &s;upport of foreign mini&s;ters. It never can be u&s;ed to increa&s;e that &s;um. Thus it may pre|vent an appropriation, for the payment of a &s;ub&s;idy to a foreign nation; it may prevent an exten&s;ion of our politi|cal foreign connections; it may prevent the rai&s;ing of troops, or the equipping of a fleet; it may prevent a war. But it never can create an expenditure of money, an army, a navy, a war, which, upon the ground of the doctrine &s;upported by our opponents, would not equally take place. The checks intended to prevent tho&s;e evils, and their in&s;e|parable attendants, taxation and public debts, cannot be too &s;trong. For it is the natural tendency of governments, and I will add, it is the natural tendency of every admini&s;|tration, and of every executive, to encrea&s;e the rate of ex|penditure beyond the nece&s;&s;ary demands, and the real abi|lities of the nation. It is here, indeed, that we may appeal to the hi&s;tory of other countries: it is here that it will af|ford us in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons, applicable to all times, and to every form of government.</P>
<P>Wherever the executive have acquired an uncontrouled command over the pur&s;e of the people, prodigality, wars, exce&s;&s;ive taxes, and ever progre&s;&s;ing debts, have unavoida|bly en&s;ued. Not to &s;peak of Spain and Holland, weakened by tho&s;e cau&s;es; not to &s;peak of France, who&s;e example is &s;till more awful, the fate of England is &s;ufficient to warn us again&s;t the dangers of that &s;y&s;tem. In vain did the in&s;ular &s;ituation of that nation pre&s;erve it from foreign inva&s;ions; in vain did &s;he alone, among&s;t the great powers of Eu|rope, enjoy the advantages of laws which protected pro|perty and encouraged indu&s;try; in vain did her agricul|ture arrive to a &s;uperior degree of perfection; in vain did &s;he obtain the commerce of the world; in vain were the trea&s;ures of India poured in her bo&s;om; in vain did the in|du&s;try

<P>Can we hope for a greater pro&s;perity&mdash;for a more fortu|nate concurrence of circum&s;tances? Have we any &s;ecurity that we &s;hall be pre&s;erved from tho&s;e evils? And yet, this is the &s;y&s;tem which flows from the doctrine which would wre&s;t from the legi&s;lature their exclu&s;ive controul over the expenditure of money; that would ve&s;t in the executive, in certain &s;pecific but widely extended ca&s;es, the power of rai&s;ing and applying money. It is the &s;y&s;tem which &s;eeks for &s;upport in the influence of patronage, by increa&s;ing the number of offices, and avowing a determination to di&s;tri|bute them exclu&s;ively as rewards among&s;t men of a certain de&s;cription. It is the &s;y&s;tem which entangles us in new po|litical connections, rai&s;es &s;tanding armies, builds navies, &s;quanders the public money, &s;wells the public debt, and multiplies the burthens of the people.</P>
<P>Shall we be told that the frequent elections of the execu|tive are a &s;ufficient &s;afeguard again&s;t every danger? Doubt|le&s;s they will, provided we are not altogether lo&s;t to our|&s;elves.

<P>May we not be alarmed, when we hear the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Bayard) in accents of regret, telling us that our executive is the mo&s;t weak, the infirm branch of government, and that danger is to be apprehended from its weakne&s;s; contra&s;ting the &s;canty provi&s;ion and in&s;igni|ficant patronage of our executive, with the immen&s;e army, the incalculable navy, the church patronage, the nobility-creating power and the civil li&s;t of the monarch of Great-Britain? And concluding, by delivering an opinion, that, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e &s;ources of corrupting influence, the hou&s;e of commons, were the venal boroughs aboli&s;hed, would lop off every prerogative of the crown, till, though the features of monarchy might remain, the &s;ub&s;tance would be gone.</P>
<P>A government which lo&s;es the &s;ub&s;tance, however it may retain the features of monarchy, is in &s;ub&s;tance a re|public; and the la&s;t idea of that gentleman is only, that a pure repre&s;entation and monarchy are incompatible.

And, when this follows his declaration of the dangers, to be feared from the weakne&s;s and infirmity of our executive, are we not irre&s;i&s;tibly forced to infer, that he thinks, that the introduction of armies, navies, patro|nage and civil li&s;t are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen our executive, and would not injure the principle of our con&s;titution?</P>

<P>I have allowed my&s;elf to make this la&s;t ob&s;ervation, only in reply to the gentleman who read the paper I allude to. It is painful to recriminate: I wi&s;h denunciations to be avoi|ded,

<P>Are gentlemen &s;erious in their fears? Do they, from us, apprehend revolutions, plunder and ma&s;&s;acre? Have we not an equal &s;take with them&s;elves?

In a country, where a &s;cattered population covers an exten&s;ive territory, where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are ea|&s;y, where the dangerous cla&s;s, which con&s;titutes an Euro|pean mob, does not exi&s;t, where actual oppre&s;&s;ion is yet unknown; the people who enjoy tho&s;e advantages, who enjoy a better government and more happine&s;s than any
<PB N="31" REF="033777_0030_0FF938BE73F135F0">other nation of the globe, are not the people ready for a revolution. Nor &s;hould it be forgotten, that tho&s;e parts of the union, that are commonly charged with a de&s;ign of over&s;etting the con&s;titution, are tho&s;e, which, on account of their peculiar &s;ituation, on account of the unhappy race of men they contain, would be expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t dan|gerous convul&s;ion by an internal revolution.</P>
<P>But the evils we wi&s;h to prevent, are preci&s;ely tho&s;e which attach to a nation in our &s;ituation; they are &s;uch as are ea&s;ily engrafted in the body-politic in its infancy; not calculated in their origin to create much alarm, and &s;up|ported by a powerful number of men who derive an imme|diate benefit from them, and to whom they are the means of acquiring wealth and power.</P>
<P>Still, in the &s;ame &s;tyle of denunciation, by whom, it is triumphantly a&s;ked, "by whom are tho&s;e charges made? By men who have rendered &s;ervices to their country? A Hampden or a Sidney alone have a right to a&s;&s;ume the lan|guage of oppo&s;ition." Was I to an&s;wer in the name of tho&s;e gentlemen, with whom I generally agree in political prin|ciples, a recapitulation of their &s;ervices would ea&s;ily repel this attack. Was I to an&s;wer as an individual, I would &s;ay that I can claim no right of that kind: I derive none from birth, none from per&s;onal merit, none from per&s;onal &s;er|vices. But as a repre&s;entative of the people, I feel it a right, and not le&s;s a duty than a right, to re&s;i&s;t, upon every occa&s;i|on, tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which, if adopted, mu&s;t, in my opinion, prove fatal to America. Should I ever, from any per&s;onal con&s;iderations, think my&s;elf unauthorized to exerci&s;e that right, I would tell my con&s;tituents,&mdash;Re&s;ume your tru&s;t; &s;end, as your repre&s;entative, a man, who, to the &s;ame zeal and to the &s;ame principles, may unite tho&s;e qualifications, which I want, and which will enable him to fulfil his tru&s;t. And, notwith&s;tanding the partiality they have, heretofore, evinced in my favour, they would find no difficulty in &s;upplying my place.</P>
<P>But, by what &s;trange fatality did the gentleman from Connecticut (M. GOODRICH) mention Hampden and Sid|ney? Surely, his evil genius mu&s;t have &s;ugge&s;ted the names; for, in the long li&s;t of Engli&s;h patriots, no two could be more applicable to the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="033777_0031_0FF938C85DB3E990">
Whenever we hear of Hampden, we mu&s;t recollect that event in his life, which has immortalized his name. The doctrine of the crown, in the ca&s;e of &s;hip-money&mdash;the doc|trine, again&s;t which Hampden made his noble &s;tand, was, that the king being, by his con&s;titutional authority, entru&s;|ted with the defence of the country, was the &s;ole judge of the danger, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ures proper to be adopted; that he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the means nece&s;&s;ary to carry into effect his con&s;titutional powers; that he had a right to fix the &s;um of money nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; and that he might, by a tax, rai&s;e that money from the people. It is true that it is not attempted here to claim this lo&s;t power for the executive. Hampden's trial has &s;ettled this point. But, in all its other parts, the doctrine of &s;hip-money, and the modern doctrine &s;upported on this occa&s;ion, are the &s;ame&mdash; the object the &s;ame&mdash;the arguments on which they are grounded the &s;ame. It is &s;till the power of rai&s;ing and ap|plying money, claimed by, or for the executive, in certain ca&s;es, with the only difference, that Charles the fir&s;t exer|ci&s;ed it by levying a tax without the con&s;ent of parliament, and that here, it is to be carried into effect, by depriving the legi&s;lature of the right of with holding their con&s;ent, through the means of amoral obligation impo&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>Sidney has left in his writings a &s;till more permanent monument of his talents, Permit me, &s;ince his name has been mentioned, to trouble the committee with quota|tion from that work, written again&s;t the divine right of kings, which brought him to the block.</P>
<P>"Men are naturally propen&s;e to corruption; and if he, who&s;e will and intere&s;t it is to corrupt them, be furni&s;hed with the means, he will never fail to do it. Power, honors, riches, and the plea&s;ures that attend them, are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a per&s;onal intere&s;t before the public good; and the number of tho&s;e who covet them is &s;o great, that he who abounds in them will be able to gain &s;o many to his &s;ervice as &s;hall be able to &s;ubdue the re&s;t. 'Tis hard to find a tyranny in the world that has not been introduced this way; for no man by his own &s;trength could ever &s;ubdue a multitude; none could ever bring many to be &s;ub&s;ervient to his ill de&s;igns, but by the rewards they re|ceived or hoped. By this means, Cae&s;ar accompli&s;hed his
<PB N="33" REF="033777_0032_0FF938D8D9BB5B48">work, and overthrew the liberty of his country, and with it, all that was then good in the world. They who were corrupted in their minds, de&s;ired to put all the power and riches into his hands, that he might di&s;tribute them to &s;uch as &s;erved him. ....</P>
<P>"They &s;peak of employing the revenue in keeping the king's hou&s;e, and look upon it as a propriety to be &s;pent as he thinks convenient: which is no le&s;s than to ca&s;t it into a pit, of which no man ever knew the bottom. That which is given one day, is &s;quandered away the next: The peo|ple are always oppre&s;t with impo&s;itions, to foment the vices of the court: The&s;e daily increa&s;ing, they grow in&s;atiable, and the mi&s;erable nations are compelled to hard labor, in order to &s;atiate tho&s;e lu&s;ts that tend to their own ruin....</P>
<P>"The ba&s;e, &s;lavi&s;h, and &s;o often &s;ubdued A&s;ia, by the ba|&s;e&s;t of men revenged the defeats they had received from the brave&s;t; and by infu&s;ing into them a delight in pomp and luxury, in a &s;hort time rendered the &s;tronge&s;t and bra|ve&s;t of nations the weake&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t. I wi&s;h our own ex|perience did not too plainly manife&s;t, that the&s;e evils were never more prevalent than in our days, when the luxury, maje&s;tic pomp, and ab&s;olute power of a neighbouring king, mu&s;t be &s;upported by an abundance of riches, torn out of the bowels of his &s;ubjects, which renders them, in the be&s;t country in the world, and at a time when the crown mo&s;t flouri&s;hes, the poore&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all the nations under the &s;un. We too well know who are mo&s;t apt to learn from them, and by what means and &s;teps they endea|vour to lead us into the like mi&s;ery. But the bird is &s;afe when the &s;nare is di&s;covered, and if we are not abandoned by God to de&s;truction, we &s;hall never be brought to con|&s;ent to the &s;ettling of that pomp, which is again&s;t the prac|tice of all virtuous people, and has brought all the nations that have been taken with it into the ruin that is intended for us."</P>
<P>The gentleman of Connecticut (Mr. GOODRICH) actua|ted by the pure&s;t motives, has invited us to &s;tate our griev|ances, and to meet on &s;ome ground of reconciliation. To operate at once a reconciliation of parties, inflamed as they now are, is perhaps impracticable, but we may not be alto|gether un&s;ucce&s;sful in e&s;tabli&s;hing at pre&s;ent &s;ome princi|ples,

Yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad I no other hearers but the gentleman of Maryland to my left (Mr. CRAIK) and the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t from New-York (Mr. WILLIAMS) I would not make any ob&s;ervation on that point.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of tho&s;e gentlemen going upon the ground of an organization of parties, avows an intention of oppo&s;ing party by party.&mdash;He looks upon us as incorrigible&mdash;he de|clares that his ob&s;ervations are not addre&s;&s;ed to the hou&s;e, but to his con&s;tituents, and I believe, it is the fir&s;t time, that a gentleman told the hou&s;e that he meant to u&s;e them only as a medium, through which to make an electioneer|ing &s;peech. When that gentleman made that declaration, I could not think him in earne&s;t; and I waited with impa|tience for arguments, or &s;omething that approached towards arguments; but half an hour of hearing convinced me of his &s;incerity, and of my mi&s;take.&mdash;Whil&s;t he remains blinded by &s;uch rooted prejudices, no ob&s;ervations of mine could, I am &s;ure, produce any effect upon him.</P>
<P>The gentleman from New-York, in the extraordinary hi&s;tory of parties he gave us, &s;eems to have de&s;cribed the fluctuations of his own mind, rather than tho&s;e of other men, and he appears to have laid a claim to a knowledge of the motives of all parties, becau&s;e he had, by turns, been acquainted with all. A great portion of his &s;peech was em|ployed in proving the uncon&s;titutionality of refu&s;ing an ap|propriation, for the purpo&s;e of carrying into a effect the powers of the pre&s;ident, or an exi&s;ting law. The fir&s;t at|tempt of the kind which I witne&s;&s;ed, was, that made, two years ago, to withhold the appropriations for the &s;upport of the mint e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. That gentleman cannot have forgotten who made the motion for that purpo&s;e, and by whom it was mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported? I need not addre&s;s that gentleman on the &s;ubject of a reconcilia|tion of parties: he may &s;afely be tru&s;ted on that point to him&s;elf: his own good &s;en&s;e and the next vibration will, doubtle&s;s, bring him back to &s;upport our principles.</P>
<P>Whatever difference of &s;entiment may exi&s;t between us on a variety of topics, there is a ground on which we mu&s;t certainly meet&mdash;on which, throughout the United States, there can be&mdash;there is, but one opinion. The importance,
<PB N="35" REF="033777_0034_0FF938E2946A9BB8">the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving the union, are too univer&s;ally ac|knowledged to require any comments at this time. The con&s;titution, which binds us together, cannot, in my opinion, be made an in&s;trument to &s;ow divi&s;ions of a fatal nature. If it met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition, when it fir&s;t made its appearance, the objections have long been buried in ob|livion; and it is a fact, that they have never &s;ince been made the in&s;trument of oppo&s;ition. Nor do I apprehend any real danger from the geographical &s;ituation of the different &s;tates: the natural bonds of union, which re&s;ult from their mutual wants, and from their relative &s;ituation, will fore|ver counteract the effect of the &s;light diver&s;ity of intere&s;ts, which may exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Without recurring to any ab&s;tract di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, has not experience taught us, that the two important &s;ubjects of divi&s;ion have heretofore been, money &s;y&s;tems and foreign politics? May we not, with truth, a&s;cribe to tho&s;e two cau|&s;es, the party &s;pirit which now rages in America? Is there any real danger to be apprehended from any other quarter? And if we are &s;atisfied that the &s;y&s;tems of debt and taxa|tion, which have been &s;o obnoxious to us, &s;hall be per|mitted to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any attempt on our part to di&s;turb them; if we are &s;atisfied, that our &s;ub&s;i&s;ting compacts with foreign nations, however dangerous &s;ome of them may have appeared to us, &s;hall remain inviolate; will the gentlemen, with whom it is our misfortune to differ, agree, that tho&s;e money-&s;y&s;tems, tho&s;e foreign connections, &s;hall not be extended beyond their pre&s;ent &s;tate? We a&s;k not for the redre&s;s of pa&s;t grievances, but, with the late Pre|&s;ident, we exclaim, <HI>"Here let us &s;top."</HI></P>
<P>May we not hope that a fixed determination to prevent the increa&s;e of the national expenditure, and, &s;o far as our pre&s;ent engagements will permit, to detach our&s;elves from any connection with European politics, will tend to recon|cile parties, and that our united efforts may then prove not altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful in promoting the happine&s;s of Ame|rica, and conciliating the affections of every part of the Union?</P>

<P>THE funding &s;y&s;tem of Great-Britain, like that of the United States, originated during the war which re&s;ulted from their revolution (that of 1688) and e&s;tabli&s;hed their liberty.</P>
<P>In 1701, at the conclu&s;ion of the reign of William III. after the end of the revolutionary war of Great-Britain, and before they had been involved in any new conte&s;ts, the debt of that country amounted to 16,394,702 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;ter|ling, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sinclair's Hi&s;t of public revenue, part 2d, chap. 4th.</NOTE> equal to dollars, 72,865,342. At that time the re|venue of that nation was 3,895,205 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, part 3d, chap. 1&s;t.</NOTE> equal to dollars, 17,312,022.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of January, 1796, the debt of the United States (after deducting the &s;tock of the bank held by the United States, and the &s;ums redeemed by the &s;inking fund) amounted to dollars, 79,811,187 <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Report of the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, dated 28th Dec. 1796.</NOTE> and the revenue for the year ending on the 30th September, 1796, amounted to&mdash; dollars, 6,665,685. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ditto, including a &s;tatement of receipts and expenditures, dated 15th Dec. 1796.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus, the apprehen&s;ion of a fate &s;imilar to that of Great-Britain cannot be looked upon as unfounded, when we find that our debt at the end of our own revolutionary war, of the war which gave the fir&s;t birth to that debt, exceeds by &s;even millions of dollars, that contracted by England during the war which al&s;o created their debt; at the &s;ame time, that the population and re&s;ources of that country, at that time, were more than double, and their revenue almo&s;t treble of our own.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the debate, the po&s;ition, that every department was independent of the others, was at lea&s;t nominally abandoned, and another argument was introduced, on which it is proper to make a few ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that whenever a <HI>law</HI> had been enacted, it became the <HI>duty</HI> of each branch of the legi&s;lature, to do any other act, which might be wanting fully to carry that law into effect: that, for in&s;tance, if an office had been created by law, it was the duty of the legi&s;lature to ap|propriate the money nece&s;&s;ary to pay the officer. And it was then inferred, that the &s;ame obligation exi&s;ted in the ca&s;e of foreign mini&s;ters, who&s;e office was created, in the opinion of &s;ome gentlemen, by the con&s;titution, and ac|cording to others, by the law of nations.</P>
<P>It will not be denied, that there are &s;ome laws, which, from their nature, impo&s;e an obligation upon future legi&s;|latures. Laws making, or authorizing loans of money, or contracts, impo&s;e the &s;ame obligation to di&s;charge the debts, thereby created, under which any individual is to pay his own debts. And the con&s;titution has, in &s;ome ca&s;es, that of judges for in&s;tance, expre&s;sly enjoined that duty. But, in ca&s;es, where the con&s;titution is &s;ilent, and where no obligation, in the nature of a debt or contract, re&s;ults from the law, it remains to be proven that the right of di&s;cretion does not exi&s;t in that body, where the power is con&s;titutionally lodged.</P>
<P>Not only, no &s;uch proofs are advanced, but the op|po&s;ite doctrine can be &s;upported by the con&s;titution it|&s;elf. The 8th &s;ection of the 1&s;t article, provides, that <Q>Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to rai&s;e and &s;upport armies; but no appropriation of money to that u&s;e &s;hall be for a longer term than two years.</Q> The object of that provi|&s;ion
<PB N="40" REF="033777_0039_0FF93911B47569B0">is, to prevent &s;tanding armies without the con&s;ent of every &s;ucceeding congre&s;s; it is to prevent a legi&s;lature from pa&s;&s;ing a perpetual law for that purpo&s;e, which could not be repealed without the con&s;ent of all the branches of future legi&s;latures; and that object is obtained, not by &s;aying, that no law for rai&s;ing armies &s;hall la&s;t longer than two years, but that the appropriations for that purpo&s;e &s;hall be limited to that period. To &s;ay, therefore, that the ap|propriation is to la&s;t no longer than two years, is to &s;ay, that every &s;ucceeding congre&s;s may, by refu&s;ing an appro|priation, prevent the army being kept on foot; it is to &s;ay, that the con&s;ent of <HI>every</HI> branch of the legi&s;lature mu&s;t be obtained every other year, in order that the army may be continued. But, if the doctrine obtains, that, where a law is made, future legi&s;latures are bound to appropriate, in or|der to carry that law into effect, this clau&s;e of the con&s;ti|tution proves altogether nugatory. At this very moment. the law, which regulates the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the United States,&mdash;which decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es that an army &s;hall be rai&s;|ed, which creates a number of offices, is perpetual. It can|no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be repealed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">out the con&s;ent of every branch of the legi&s;lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f that doctrine prevails, it follows, that Cong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s is bound to make the nece&s;&s;ary approp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iations for the &s;upport of the army, for the pay of the offices cre|ated by that law and thus the con&s;titution is made to &s;ay, that "appropriations &s;hall be for no longer time than two years;"&mdash;but, that appropriations &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily be re|newed at the end of every period of two years. The con|&s;titution is made to &s;ay, that the con&s;ent of every &s;ucceed|ing hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport an ar|my &mdash;but, that every &s;ucceeding hou&s;e is bound to give its con&s;ent. Either that clau&s;e of the con&s;titution means no|thing, either that clau&s;e mu&s;t be era&s;ed from the con&s;titu|tion, or it admits that there exi&s;ts a right to withhold ap|propriations for the &s;upport of an e&s;tabli&s;hment or office created by law. Otherwi&s;e the con&s;titution, in order to obtain the intended object, would have declared, not that appropriations &s;hould be limited in their duration, but, that the laws creating an army and military offices &s;hould be temporary. It is remarkable, that in Great-Britain, the &s;ame object, that is to &s;ay, a power in the hou&s;e of commons,
<PB N="41" REF="033777_0040_0FF9391906590FA0">to prevent the exi&s;tence of a &s;tanding army, is obtained through &s;imilar means. The mutiny-bill, which &s;ubjects the army to that di&s;cipline, that alone can in&s;ure its exi&s;|tence, is always annual; and it has never been denied, that it was for that purpo&s;e, that that bill was not made per|petual. Yet, according to the modern doctrine of moral obligation, as the laws of England for rai&s;ing armies are not temporary, it would follow, that the hou&s;e of com|mons is <HI>bound</HI> to pa&s;s the mutiny-bill yearly; and, there|fore, that the cu&s;tom of making it an annual law is perfect|ly nugatory.</P>
<P>The &s;econd po&s;ition a&s;&s;umed, in &s;upport of the doctrine of moral obligation, to appropriate for the &s;upport of fo|reign mini&s;ters, is as unfounded as the fir&s;t. Neither the con&s;titution nor the law of nations, <HI>create</HI> the office of fo|reign mini&s;ters. Both <HI>recognize the po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence</HI> of tho&s;e offices; both declare that tho&s;e offices <HI>may,</HI> but neither directs that they <HI>&s;hall</HI> exi&s;t. To &s;ay, that becau&s;e the Uni|ted States and Turkey are two independent nations, and may, re&s;pectively, &s;end public mini&s;ters one to the other, it follows, that the office of amba&s;&s;ador from the United States to Turkey exi&s;ted from the day of the declaration of inde|pendence, is to revive the &s;chola&s;tic entities of the 13th century. To &s;ay, that becau&s;e the con&s;titution has ve&s;ted in the executive, the power of appointing public mini&s;ters, it follows, that the office of amba&s;&s;ador from the United States to Turkey, now exi&s;ts; or to &s;ay, that an office ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been created more than twenty years, and yet has never exi&s;ted, are metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtleties, far beyond my under|&s;tanding, and which I cannot under take to reconcile.</P>
<P>But, it may confidently be a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;uppor|ters of that &s;trange doctrine, do not them&s;elves &s;uppo&s;e that either the law of nations, or the con&s;titution, go any farther than a recognition of the po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence of the office. For, if it was true, that the offices of public mini|&s;ters from the United States, to every other independent nation, were actually created by either, it mu&s;t follow, that, in the &s;ame manner, as congre&s;s is &s;aid to be bound to appropriate for their &s;upport, &s;o the pre&s;ident mu&s;t al&s;o be bound to fill, by appointments, all tho&s;e pre-exi&s;ting offices. He mu&s;t be bound to fill the office of amba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="42" REF="033777_0041_0FF9392217A76798">to Au&s;tria, to Turkey, and to the Pope, created by the law of nations, or by the con&s;titution: that is to &s;ay, created by a pre-exi&s;ting and controuling law, in the &s;ame manner as he is bound to fill the offices of judges, or collectors of the revenue, which have been created by law. It is not in|&s;i&s;ted, that in this la&s;t ca&s;e he has any di&s;cretion, and it is not denied, that in the ca&s;e of mini&s;ters, he may or he may not appoint. The two ca&s;es, therefore, are not &s;imilar. The legal obligation which binds his di&s;cretion in one ca&s;e, does not bind it is the other. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, he is bound, becau&s;e the offices are created by a pre-exi&s;ting law: in the la&s;t in&s;tance, he is not bound, becau&s;e the offi|ces are not created by any pre-exi&s;ting law.</P>
<P>It was of importance, that the a&s;&s;ertion &s;hould have been refuted, <Q>that tho&s;e offices were <HI>created</HI> by the law of nations or by the con&s;titution, or in any manner ex|i&s;ted before any appointment had ever been made by the executive;</Q> not only in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the con&s;titu|tional powers of congre&s;s, but al&s;o in relation to another point, which was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a former part of the debate.</P>
<P>When &s;peaking of the danger, which might hereafter ari&s;e from an exten&s;ion of the executive patronage, if left unchecked by the power of congre&s;s over the expenditure of money, it was ob&s;erved, that the offices of public mi|ni&s;ters to foreign courts were preci&s;ely tho&s;e, which, from their nature and the rate of &s;alary, would be mo&s;t accep|table to gentlemen who held &s;eats in the legi&s;lature. In &s;up|port of that ob&s;ervation, it was &s;tated, that from the begin|ning of the year 1794, to the pre&s;ent time, only five pub|lic mini&s;ters (exclu&s;ively of envoys extraordinary) had been &s;ent to Europe, and of tho&s;e five, four were taken out of congre&s;s, viz. Me&s;&s;rs. Munroe, Murray, King, and W. Smith. But &s;ome further ob&s;ervations were made on the &s;ubject of the appointment of this la&s;t gentleman. At the beginning of the la&s;t extraordinary &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, there were five ordinary mini&s;ters in Europe, to wit: four mi|ni&s;ters plenipotentiary to Great-Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, re&s;pectively, and a mini&s;ter re&s;ident to Holland, and the &s;ums appropriated by law, were fixed according to that e&s;tabli&s;hment. During the cour&s;e of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, the pre&s;ident of the United States appointed Mr. Adams,
<PB N="43" REF="033777_0042_0FF93929C0A8C708">(who had been appointed mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Por|tugal, by the late pre&s;ident,) mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Pru&s;&s;ia, where, till then, we had no mini&s;ter. A new emba&s;|&s;y was thus created, which, being filled by the removal of the mini&s;ter to Portugal, left this la&s;t office vacant. An ad|ditional appropriation was a&s;ked from congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e; it was debated, and oppo&s;ed in the hou&s;e on the 3d of July. Mr. Smith, then a member, argued and voted in favour of it. The motion, made in a committee of the whole, to refu&s;e that appropriation, was rejected on the &s;ame day; and on the &s;ucceeding day, the bill making that, and &s;everal other appropriations, pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e. On the following day, the 5th, Mr. Smith was officially in|formed, that the pre&s;ident meant to appoint him to the emba&s;&s;y of Portugal, and on the 6th, his nomination was accordingly laid before the Senate. On the &s;ame day, the propriety of making the appropriation was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before that body, the que&s;tion was taken by yeas and nays, and carried in the affirmative, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed that hou&s;e with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n amendment. The bill finally pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es on the 7th, and became a law on the 10th of the &s;ame mouth.</P>
<P>Had the additional appropriation been refu&s;ed, the &s;ums already appropriated would have enabled the pre&s;ident to pay the &s;alaries of the mini&s;ters to England, France, Spain and Holland, and al&s;o that of the new emba&s;&s;y to Pru&s;&s;ia; for tho&s;e &s;ums were appropriated generally, and though merely &s;ufficient to pay five mini&s;ters, might, according to his di&s;cretion, be applied to pay mini&s;ters to any five fo|reign countries he cho&s;e: but he could not then have ap|pointed a new mini&s;ter to Portugal. Mr. Smith, therefore, was appointed to an office which could not have been fil|led, without that appropriation made by that congre&s;s of which he was a member,&mdash;without that appropriation for which he voted him&s;elf. A view of tho&s;e circum&s;tances in|duced me to expre&s;s an opinion, that that appointment was improper, and contrary to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, which enacts, (article 1&s;t, &s;ection 6th,) that "no &s;enator or repre&s;entative &s;hall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authori|ty of the United States, which &s;hall have been <HI>created,</HI> or
<PB N="44" REF="033777_0043_0FF93930602C6F58">the emoluments whereof &s;hall have been encrea&s;ed during &s;uch time." Had Mr. Smith been appointed mini&s;ter to Pru&s;&s;ia, in&s;tead of Portugal, I would have &s;aid that the ap|pointment was contrary to the letter of the con&s;titution it|&s;elf; but as the mode adopted was to create a new emba&s;&s;y, to fill that emba&s;&s;y by the mini&s;ter to Portugal, and then to give the vacancy thus created to the member of congre&s;s, I was of opinion, although the money voted by congre&s;s, was in fact applied to pay his &s;alary, that the appointment could only be &s;aid to be contrary to the &s;pirit of the con&s;ti|tution. That opinion was altogether grounded upon the principle that the office of public mini&s;ter to a foreign coun|try, where we had not an before, did not begin to exi&s;t till the fir&s;t appointment took place. But if the fanciful doc|trine is admitted, that tho&s;e offices were created by the law of nations or con&s;titution, that although not exi&s;ting in fact, yet they were pre-exi&s;ting; it follows, that the &s;alutary provi&s;ions of that clau&s;e of the con&s;titution &s;hall be render|ed ineffectual, and that, at &s;ome future period, the execu|tive may appoint members of congre&s;s, during the time for which they were elected, to as many new offices of amba&s;|&s;ador, as it may be nece&s;&s;ary, not to <HI>create,</HI> but to <HI>fill,</HI> in order to obtain a majority that &s;hall think them&s;elves under a <HI>moral</HI> obligation to make the requi&s;ite appropriations.</P>
<P>When it was thought fit to abandon the po&s;ition that the &s;everal departments might have checks within them|&s;elves, but could not be checked by the others, an enume|ration of the ca&s;es in which tho&s;e checks might exi&s;t was attempted; and it was &s;aid that a department might be checked by another fir&s;t, when the power was expre&s;sly given by the con&s;titution, as in the in&s;tance of the nega|tive of the pre&s;ident to any law of congre&s;s; &s;econdly, when any department acted contrary to the con&s;titution, as in the in&s;tance of the judiciary, declaring a law to be un|con&s;titutional; thirdly, when a general power was given to one department, and a &s;pecific one, which might be car|ved out of the general one, to another department, as in the in&s;tance of the general power of making treaties given to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, and of the &s;pecific power of declaring war ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, which la&s;t power mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an exception to the treaty making pow|er.
<PB N="45" REF="033777_0044_0FF939406521D048">This was the fir&s;t time that a conce&s;&s;ion was made that the treaty-making power was limited in any in&s;tance by the &s;pecific powers of congre&s;s; but the conce&s;&s;ion went farther than was intended; for, upon the &s;ame principle, it mu&s;t be conceded, that the &s;pecific power of regulating commerce, ve&s;ted in congre&s;s, is, al&s;o an exception to the power of making treaties: and it would be extremely dif|ficult to &s;how how the power of making treaties, or of ap|pointing amba&s;&s;adors, could be carved out of, and make an exception to the power of granting and appropriating money exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however &s;trike the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;erver, that the three in&s;tances, where the conce&s;&s;ion was thus made, were not brought in, in order to illu&s;trate the cla&s;&s;ification, but, that the cla&s;&s;ification was made, in order to &s;uit the three ca&s;es, which it was thought convenient to concede. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that departments can check one another re&s;pectively, except when one of them acts con|trary to the con&s;titution, or when the power of checking a con&s;titutional act, is given by the con&s;titution. And that power is given in two different manners, either by fir&s;t giv|ing <HI>full</HI> power to one department, and then declaring, that that power &s;hall not, however, be exerci&s;ed without the con&s;ent of another department, as in the ca&s;e of the nega|tive of the pre&s;ident; or, by dividing the power in the fir&s;t in&s;tance between two departments, giving only a <HI>partial</HI> power to each over the act to be completed, as has already &s;ufficiently been explained.</P>
<P>It will not be improper here to repeat what was ob&s;er|ved in the former part of the debate, that this was the fir&s;t time when a con&s;titutional objection was made to the power of the hou&s;e, to refu&s;e an appropriation in this ca&s;e. When the fir&s;t law was pa&s;&s;ed, providing the means of in|tercour&s;e with foreign nations, which was in the year 1790, the following ob&s;ervations were made by Mr. William Smith, of S. Carolina. "The arrangement which &s;ome gentlemen talked of, laid with the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. It was they who were to determine when and where to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters; all that the hou&s;e had to do, was to make provi&s;ion for their &s;upport. The que&s;tion then is not whether any &s;hould be appointed, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="033777_0045_0FF9394D05C2BB40">it does not lay with the hou&s;e to determine; to be &s;ure, if they were of opinion that all intercour&s;e with fo|reign nations, &s;hould be cut off, <HI>they might decline to make provi&s;ion for them,</HI> but he did not believe this was the inten|tion of any gentleman: perhaps gentlemen may think it que&s;tionable, whether the pre&s;ident can &s;end them, unle&s;s they are previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; but for his part, he thought it was a bu&s;ine&s;s clearly within the executive branch, and with which the legi&s;lature had nothing to do, but to provide for the payment of their &s;alaries and expen|ces, <HI>and this,</HI> if it was properly con&s;idered, <HI>was a compe|tent check; if the hou&s;e</HI> at any time <HI>neglected to provide</HI> for &s;uch officers, <HI>the pre&s;ident mu&s;t</HI> either <HI>recal them</HI> or pay them out of his private pur&s;e." (<HI>See Congre&s;&s;ional Regi&s;ter-vol.</HI> 3, <HI>p.</HI> 115, 116.)</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, it is, that the bill has been uniformly limited to two years; and it is the only law, fixing the &s;alaries of officers, which is thus limited. Mr. Lawrence, who moved the clau&s;e to limit the act, &s;aid, that "it was proper to do it, becau&s;e the circum|&s;tances of the union might require a le&s;s &s;um perhaps than was contemplated at pre&s;ent." (do. p. 177.) Was not this allowing that congre&s;s mu&s;t be judges of the cir|cum&s;tances? for, if the executive alone was to judge, and if congre&s;s was bound to ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">priate, what danger could re&s;ult from making the act perpetual? or what advantage could be derived from the limitation?</P>
<P>The only idea thrown out in relation to the con&s;titu|tional que&s;tion, which has not been notice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is, that as we had agreed, that, after having made the appropriations nece&s;&s;ary to carry a treaty into effect, that treaty, however in|choate it might be before, became then binding upon the na|tion and upon congre&s;s; thus, in this in&s;tance, as congre&s;s had agreed in 1796, to appropriate at the rate of 9000 dollars each, for the mini&s;ters to Spain and Portugal, and in 1797, to appropriate for the mini&s;ter to Pru&s;&s;ia, tho&s;e acts mu&s;t al&s;o be binding upon us at pre&s;ent. It is almo&s;t an in&s;ult to the &s;agacity of the reader, to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>annual</HI> appropriations, made for tho&s;e mini&s;ters, can give no con|gre&s;&s;ional &s;anction to the office, beyond the period of time to which they extend; and that the rea&s;on why appropria|tions,
<PB N="47" REF="033777_0046_0FF9395745EBBF40">made to carry a treaty into effect, render that treaty binding upon the nation and congre&s;s, is becau&s;e they ex|pre&s;s the a&s;&s;ent of the legi&s;lature to a <HI>compact</HI> with another nation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<HEAD><HI>Note to Page</HI> 12, <HI>on the Duties of Con&s;uls.</HI></HEAD>
<P>That con&s;uls were adequate to the protection of com|merce, in the ca&s;es here &s;pecified, and in common times had been fully conceded in the cour&s;e of the debate by a gen|tleman well acquainted with the &s;ubject (Mr. Pinkney.) Their duties are defined by Marten's Law of Nations, (book 4, chap. 3, &s;ect. 8.) to be, "to watch over the commercial intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, <HI>particularly the ob&s;ervation of the trea|ties of commerce,</HI> and to a&s;&s;i&s;t with their advice and <HI>interpo|&s;ition,</HI> tho&s;e of their nation, whom commercial pur&s;uits or connections have led to the place for which they are named." But when the law of nations or treaties are in|fringed by government it&s;elf, as has frequently been the ca&s;e with the belligerent powers during the pre&s;ent war, the interference of diplomatic characters, of public mini|&s;ters, becomes nece&s;&s;ary. The amendment propo&s;ed, would not, if adopted, have affected the mini&s;ters to any of the belligerent powers, and could not, therefore, be charged as withdrawing all protection from commerce. But, it is remarkable, that, when the inconveniences ari&s;ing from the conduct of the belligerent powers were de&s;cribed, when it was &s;tated that con&s;uls, re&s;iding in &s;ea-ports, could not attend at the &s;eat of government, and &s;pecially at Paris, to protect the intere&s;ts of their fellow citizens, who&s;e fate was generally decided there, and when from thence a con|clu&s;ion was drawn, that con&s;uls were inadequate to protect commerce, no mention was made of the con&s;equence of the extraordinary &s;ituation in which our commerce was thus placed in France. The con&s;equence was, that a number of extra-mini&s;terial duties, falling on the public mini&s;ter there, which were not &s;trictly within the province of his office, it became nece&s;&s;ary to appoint a con&s;ul general to re&s;ide at Paris, to corre&s;pond with the different con&s;uls in the
<PB N="48" REF="033777_0047_0FF939616374A900" MS="y">&s;ea-ports, and to attend to the commercial intere&s;ts of our citizens at the &s;eat of government. In the &s;ame manner, the numerous captures of the Briti&s;h, have rendered a new appointment nece&s;&s;ary in that country, in order to attend to tho&s;e duties which do not fall within the province of a public mini&s;ter, and a &s;pecial agent has been appointed there, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our citizens in pro&s;ecuting their claims before courts of ju&s;tice&mdash;an office pretty &s;imilar to that of con&s;ul general at Paris.</P>
