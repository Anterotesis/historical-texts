<P>THESE People were fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of Qua|kers in England, about the middle of the la&s;t century. George Fox was the principal In&s;trument of gathering them into a religi|ous &s;ociety.

incident to youth; &s;olicitous, above all things, to obtain the favour of God, and to avoid every thing which either the Scriptures or the inward principle of Divine Grace taught him to believe was offen&s;ive to him; though in &s;o doing many corrupt practices, which cu&s;tom had familiarized to the Profe&s;|&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, pre&s;ented them&s;elves as ob&s;tacles in his way, which for a time occa&s;ioned him much anxiety, le&s;t his own particular pro&s;pect &s;hould mi&s;lead him; but as he retained an inflexible integrity, he gained experience by the things that he &s;uffered, and as his under&s;tanding was gradually illuminated, he received &s;atisfaction in the many doubts he had long pain|fully laboured under. In the Year 1647, and 23d year of his age, he travelled through &s;everal counties of England, &s;eeking out &s;uch as, in religions tenderne&s;s, were inquiring after the way of life and &s;alvation: the&s;e he taught both by precept and ex|ample the benefit of retiring into &s;ilence, and in&s;tructed them to cea&s;e from all &s;elf-performances to turn to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t in their own hearts, and wait to feel the in&s;tructio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit there, that their knowledge, wor&s;hip and religious &s;ervices, might not &s;tand in the will of man, but in <Q>the power of an endle&s;s life.</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;ervice of love he continued &s;ome years, and his la|bours were &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, that great numbers were convinced by his Mini&s;try and that of others who were gathered into the &s;ame inward divine Principle, who at fir&s;t were called, <HI>Children of the Light.</HI> But the power and reverential awe attending them &s;o affected their minds, and tho&s;e of the piou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed people to whom they mini&s;tered, as often to cau&s;e them to tremble before the Divine Maje&s;ty, under an aba&s;ing &s;en&s;e of their own unworthine&s;s, whence they were in deri&s;ion called Quakers; which name they have &s;ince been mo&s;t generally known by in the world; tho' from their mutual love and patient &s;uffering of injuries, which they held ought ever to mark the Followers of Chri&s;t, they &s;tiled them|&s;elves <HI>Friends, or the Friends of Truth.</HI> Thus it was, that a man without any worldly advantages of &s;tation or literature, meerly by a continued attention to the guidance of that Di|vine

For according to &s;cripture te&s;timony and the corre&s;|pondent evidences of Go&s;pel Light, in their own hearts, they found, that while men's affections are engro&s;&s;ed by the plea|&s;ures and delights of this world, they are dead to a &s;en&s;e of the Divine Life in them; the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration and the power by which this great work is effected, are both inclu|ded in that doctrine of the apo&s;tle, <HI>If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but if ye thro' the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live: for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the Sons of God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom,</HI> viii, 13.</NOTE></P>

In the Year 1681, the province of Penn&s;ylvania being granted to William Penn, he removed thither with a con&s;iderable number of his friends, mo&s;tly of the people called Quakers. It is wor|thy of &s;pecial notice, that mo&s;t of the &s;ettlements in Ame|rica were made with little regard to any prior title in the na|tives; but William Penn did not think his permi&s;&s;ion to colo|nize the tract of land granted to him by king Charles II. a &s;ufficient title to the country; but a&s;&s;embled the Sachems or Prin|ces, and obtained their con&s;ent to &s;ettle upon the extent of land that he wanted. When it became nece&s;&s;ary to extend the settle|ment, new lands were purcha&s;ed from the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, which e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o much love and confidence in them towards William Penn and the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Penn&s;ylvania, that his and their names were, and &s;till continue to be, revered among&s;t them.</P>

and profanene&s;s were di&s;couraged, and tho&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hments which tend to deprive men of their religious and civil rights avoided.

<P>And in order to guard, as much as was in his power again&s;t the in&s;tability of future human councils, William Penn provided, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, in the la&s;t paragraph of his charter, that this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Liberty and Privlege &s;hould be pre&s;erv|ed inviolate, in the following memorable conclu&s;ion of it, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>But becau&s;e the happine&s;s of mankind depends &s;o much upon the enjoying of liberty of their con&s;ciences as afore&s;aid, I do

<P>This general Liberty of Con&s;cience was the natural effect of the divine principle of light and truth profe&s;&s;ed by the Quakers, who hold none excluded from the favour of God on account of their different religious per&s;ua&s;ion, provided it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> founded on the fear of God and love to mankind. A government e&s;tabli&s;h|ed upon &s;o liberal and exten&s;ive a plan, was an encouragement to great numbers of different per&s;ua&s;ions to emigrate from va|rious countries, where many had &s;uffered for their non confor|mity to eccle&s;ia&s;tical requi&s;itions, to &s;ettle under a con&s;titution, the ba&s;is of which was religious and civil liberty, to which wi&s;e provi&s;ion the rapid &s;ettlement and improvement of the Province has, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence been principally owing.

The Quakers hold that this law of truth, this te&s;t of virtue and vice is not hid from any part of mankind; but that every man born into the world, is enlightened by it; the &s;erious and well di&s;po&s;ed Heathens, in different ages and nations, have, un|der various appellations, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;ibility of the ex|i&s;tence and efficacy of this Divine Principle, this law of God written in the heart, to deliver from that corruption under which they laboured. Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Epictetus, and &s;everal others of the philo&s;ophers called their di&s;ciples to an attention to its dictates.

And that the &s;pilling of human blood was not acceptable in the eyes of perfect Purity, who the apo&s;tle denominates under the appellation of love, <HI>God is Love,</HI> appears from the prohibition laid upon king David, not to build an hou&s;e unto God, on ac|count of his having been concerned in the de&s;truction of &s;o ma|ny of his fellow creatures, as him&s;elf declared, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxii. 8. <Q>The word of the Lord came to me, &s;aying, Thou ha&s;t &s;hed blood abundantly, and ha&s;t made great wars; thou &s;halt not build an hou&s;e unto my name, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;hed much blood upon the earth in my fight.</Q></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHAT IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?</HEAD>
<P>IS it one who a&s;&s;erts to and believes certain facts, as recorded in holy writ, and forms certain principles and opinions thereup|on; producing perhaps a partial reformation, an ab&s;taining from the gro&s;&s;er pollutions of &s;in, but denying the po&s;&s;ibility of a total clean&s;ing and freedom from &s;in in this world? Or is it one who knows not in word only, but in deed and in truth, a death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; a being born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of man, but of God? For, &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, "except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." A man may know with Nicodemus, and confe&s;s, that Chri&s;t is a teach|er &s;ent from God, he may be able to talk much about the doc|trines of the go&s;pel, and fancy him&s;elf &s;ecure by imputation, but what has this to do with the new birth &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary? What can all his wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding teach him. Nay, he cannot come into the new birth till all is parted with. The very nature of the thing implies a beginning again, a life as dif|ferent, from his former as light from darkne&s;s. <Q>Ye were &s;ometime darkne&s;s,</Q> &s;ays Paul, "but now are ye light in the Lord." Now he who knows this new birth, not a change

of opinion, not a comprehending the truths of the go&s;pel in his under&s;tanding, or joining this or that &s;ociety, but who knows the thing it&s;elf; not the name, not the imaginations concerning it, but the nature, the life, the e&s;&s;ence, will &s;uch a man be like what he was before.</P>
<P>The forerunner of our Lord expre&s;sly told his hearers; when preparing them for the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, <Q>The axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire.</Q> What tree and what root is there meant? Is it outward or inward? Who can an&s;wer that, but he who hath felt the axe, and the de&s;truction in a mea&s;ure of the corrupt tree? <Q>His fan is in his hand, he adds, and he will thoroughly purge his floor;</Q> (mark "thoroughly,") what will remain then? that pro|fe&s;&s;ors were concerned to know, and willing to part, with all that &s;tands in the way, that they may know indeed what it is to be thoroughly purged, in&s;tead of denying the po&s;&s;ibility of it; for it is a dreadful thing to oppo&s;e or deny the power of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart," but modern Chri&s;tians, as they would be thought, &s;ay, There is no purity of heart, but it is and mu&s;t remain deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked? Again it is &s;aid, <Q>who brings a clean thing out of an unclean?</Q> That the heart is naturally unclean as allowed, but hath not the Lord promi&s;ed to clean&s;e his peo|ple from all their uncleanne&s;&s;es; mark all, what uncleanne&s;s will then remain? Some attempt to excu&s;e them&s;elves by what Paul once experienced; <Q>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h; a law in the members warring again&s;t the law of the mind.</Q> That Paul once felt that, is allowed, but did he not after &s;ay, <Q>There is no con|demnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h but after the &s;pirit,</Q> and did he not &s;ay, "The law of the &s;pirit of life had made him free from the law

of &s;in; and how could they who were dead unto &s;in live any longer therein?" Doth he not again &s;ay, <Q>I am dead with Chri&s;t, neverthele&s;s I live, yet not I, (not natural &s;inful &s;elf,) but Chri&s;t liveth in me?" "I will dwell in them, and walk in them, &s;aith the Lord;</Q> and will the Lord dwell in an un|holy place? As &s;oon would light dwell with darkne&s;s. Satan can indeed tran&s;form him&s;elf into an angel of light, yea, he, as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God. The imagining part in man is &s;ure to be deceived, and wor|&s;hip the appearance in&s;tead of the reality, for the worldby wi&s;|dom, man by his natural or humanly acquired abilities, knew not, nor ever can know God. "If any man, &s;ays Paul, will be wi&s;e, let him fir&s;t become a fool," that his old eye may be clo&s;|ed, and the new eye which alone can di&s;cern the things of God, may be opened.</P>
<P>Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith, <Q>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</Q> But modern Chri&s;tians, as they call them&s;elves, &s;ay there is no &s;uch thing as perfection. O that they would con&s;ider whom they oppo&s;e by &s;o &s;aying.</P>

<P>Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Swear not at all;" but modern Chri|&s;tians &s;ay, We may &s;wear in &s;ome ca&s;es.

I became &s;en&s;ible, that the tree mu&s;t fir&s;t be made good, before the fruit could be good; a doctrine e&s;&s;enti|ally different from what I had heard of men, even of men highly e&s;teemed; by whom I was taught, that deliverance from &s;in is not to be expected in this life; and was hearing, day after day, the uniform acknowledgement of 'being mi&s;erable &s;inners, hav|ing no health,' &amp;c. which I found by the manife&s;tations of that &s;pirit which "is given to every man to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7, and which di&s;covers the &s;ecret things of darkne&s;s, to be not agreeable, but contrary, to the &s;criptures of truth; which expre&s;sly declare, that the great Author of the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation "came to &s;ave his people <HI>from</HI> their &s;ins," Matt. 1.21, and <HI>not in them:</HI> a very e&s;&s;ential difference. This I believe mu&s;t be experimentally known, feeling &s;in to be the great di&s;|ea&s;e of the &s;oul, the alone cau&s;e of &s;eparation from the mo&s;t High, in whom alone true happine&s;s is found. I was &s;en&s;ible that while &s;in remained, the &s;eparation mu&s;t continue, there being "no communion between light and darkne&s;s, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; 2. Cor. vi. 14, nor could that gracious promi&s;e be fulfilled, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them, I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people;" 2 Cor vi. 16, for the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "ye are the temple of God, and the temple of God is holy." 1 Cor. iii. 17.</P>
<P>Further, John the Bapti&s;t who was &s;ent to prepare the way of the Lord, de&s;cribing the nature and effects of his ma&s;ter's kingdom, &s;ays "Now (mark now) is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire." Mat. iii 10. This is a language &s;urely implying a complete, effectual clean&s;ing from all the pollutions of &s;in, even now in this life. Our Lord him&s;elf uni|formly, in all his di&s;cour&s;es, inculcated this doctrine. In that

mo&s;t excellent &s;ermon on the Mount, Matt. v. 6.7, he in&s;i&s;ts on the nece&s;&s;ity of a righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;uperior to that of the law; for &s;ays he, "except your righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> no ca&s;e enter in|to the kingdom of heaven." What language can be plainer? And that he did not mean an imaginary, merely imputed right|eousne&s;s, as I fear, many vainly &s;uppo&s;e, is evident from the conclu&s;ion; where he draws the compari&s;on between tho&s;e who hear, and do his &s;ayings, and them who hear and do them not; thereby fully e&s;tabli&s;hing the po&s;&s;ibility of doing them&punc; And if due attention is paid to every part of that di&s;cour&s;e, I think it mu&s;t be obvious, that they who are of the happy number, who not only hear, but do tho&s;e &s;ayings; and who our Lord li|kens to a building upon a rock, on which they are able to with&s;tand all oppo&s;ition; will not be mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do, having no health in them; &amp;c. but will know a righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in them far &s;uperior to that of the law. For, as the law, the outward law, written on ta|bles of &s;tone, took cognizance of outward actions; the law of Chri&s;t, written, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, in the fle&s;hly tables of the heart, reaches to the root, and &s;ource of action; for, whereas the law &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt not kill," Chri&s;t forbids being an|gry without cau&s;e. Again, the law &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt not com|mit adultery;" Chri&s;t forbids lu&s;t, thus &s;triking at the root. The cau&s;e being removed, the con&s;equence or effect mu&s;t una|voidably be done away. Once more, the law &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Re&s;i&s;t not evil, love your enemies, do good to them that hate you;" with much more of like import, which many who profe&s;s to follow him, &s;eem to pay very little attention to; as though it was an indifferent matter, whether they do them or not. But it may be well for &s;uch to con&s;ider whether our Lord would have &s;aid, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is per|fect," if he did not mean that they &s;hould be &s;o; and whether they who do as he there exhorts, will not be perfect. I can|not

conceive how it is po&s;&s;ible to deduce any other inference without gro&s;sly wre&s;ting the &s;cripture "Ye are my friends," &s;aid he at another time, <Q>if ye do what&s;oever I have command|ed you.</Q> John xv. 14. <Q>He that loveth me keepeth my commandments,</Q> John xiv. 21. "Not every one that &s;aith unto me Lord, Lord, (that call me ma&s;ter and honour me with their lips,) &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven." Matt. vii. 21. "If ye know the&s;e things happy are ye if ye do them," John xiii. 17. For if the &s;imple belief of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, re&s;urrection, &amp;c. be &s;ufficient to &s;ave; to what purpo&s;e was all his di&s;cour&s;es, wherein he repeatedly in&s;i&s;ts upon the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, a being born again; which certainly implies &s;omething more than a change of opinion, a per&s;ua&s;ion of the judgment, and a partial reformation? For as he &s;aid to Nicode|mus, "That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h, and that which is born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit," John iii. 6. it obviou&s;ly follows, that they who are really born of the spirit, will be of the &s;ame nature as the &s;pirit. "Old things will be pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things become new, and all of God," 2 Cor. v. 17. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," Luke xiii. 21. "New wine mu&s;t be put into new bottles." Mark ii. 22; with many other &s;imilitudes, plainly implying the nece&s;&s;ity of a total effec|tual change. Again to confirm this great and nece&s;&s;ary truth of freedom from &s;in, he &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed, and ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free," and, to reprove their carnal ideas of a temporal outward freedom, he adds, "He that committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in," and "If the Son &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed," John viii 31. &amp;c. That this freedom from &s;in, even from the power, as well as the guilt, is to be known in this life, is certified again, by his &s;aying of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, "Whither I go, ye cannot come," John viii. 21. Now if deliverance from &s;in is not known in this life, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity die in our &s;ins. Therefore it matters not what knowledge a man hath, what is
<PB N="55" REF="035518_0054_10055B86920DBC10">
his faith, or what profe&s;&s;ion he hath made, if he hath not known deliverance from &s;in. This is a point &s;o important, and a mi&s;take therein liable to &s;uch baneful con&s;equences, that I am induced to dwell upon it: knowing from my own experience, how pre|vailing is the contrary opinion. Nor is it &s;trange, that people &s;hould prefer and indulge the notion of the po&s;&s;ibility of deli|verance from the guilt and puni&s;hment of &s;in, without the pow|er thereof being &s;ubdued. We naturally love ea&s;e, an ea&s;e which the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t is decidedly again&s;t. So clo&s;e does it apply, that it is, in our Lord's own words, as cutting off a right hand, and plucking out a right eye. Matt. vi. 29.30. "Who &s;oever," &s;ays he, again and again, "doth not bear his cro&s;s, and come after me, cannot be my di&s;ciple," Luke xiv. 27. The apo&s;tle bears te&s;timony to this important truth, where he &s;ays "They that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the fle&s;h with its affec|tions and lu&s;ts." Gal. v. xxiv. Surely if lu&s;ts and affections, the very root and &s;eed of &s;in, are &s;lain, what can remain there|of? In another place he &s;ays, "How &s;hall we that are dead to &s;in live any longer therein?" Rom. vi. 2. Another apo&s;tle &s;ays, Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God." 1 John iii. 9.</P>
<P>I have produced a few plain pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, to &s;hew the ground or cau&s;e of my &s;eparation; that deliverance from &s;in, a being clean&s;ed from all defilement thereof in this life, is not only po&s;&s;ible, but indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; and that the contra|ry doctrine is fundamentally erroneous; as it &s;ets up the &s;ha|dow in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance, an imaginary, in&s;tead of a real holine&s;s. I may probably make &s;ome more ob&s;ervations on this mo&s;t important point, as I proceed. I &s;hall now offer a few remarks on &s;ome of the &s;ervices u&s;ually performed; com|paring them al&s;o with the &s;criptures of truth, which mo&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ors acknowledge to be the &s;tandard or rule; from which compari&s;on they clearly appear to me, not to be what many call them, means of grace and ordinances of God; but the mere inventions of man, &s;et up in his own fallen wi&s;dom, as a &s;ub&s;ti|tute
<PB N="56" REF="035518_0055_10055B8BF3272F30">
for the life and power, which were lo&s;t in a long dark night of apo&s;tacy: not the true wor&s;hip of God, but &s;uch bodily exer|ci&s;e as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "profiteth little, 1 Tim. iv. 8. For be it remembered, the great Author of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation expre&s;sly declared, "that the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth," John iv. 23. And the apo&s;|tle confirms it, by &s;aying, "We know not what we &s;hould pray for, as we ought; but the &s;pirit helpeth our infirmities and maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, Rom. vii. 26. Therefore, as this nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not at our command, for people to pretend to wor&s;hip the Mo&s;t High in a pre&s;cribed form, or in the &s;tudied or extempore pro|ductions of their own natural or acquired abilities, in their own wills, and their own time, without waiting to feel the influences and movings of the Holy Spirit, in and through which alone true wor&s;hip can be performed, appears to me to be nothing better, whatever it may be called, than <HI>will-wor&s;hip.</HI> The &s;criptures al&s;o repeatedly mention a growing in grace, 2 Pet. iii. 18, a going on unto perfection, Heb. vi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> How incon&s;i&s;tent then is the repeated uniform acknowledgment, "We are mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what we ought not to do, having no health in us," &amp;c? Doth it not obviou&s;ly confe&s;s, if the truth is &s;poken, that no benefit hath been received, notwith&s;tanding the frequent (as it is pretended) waiting upon the Lord? But if it is true, as the &s;criptures declare, that Chri&s;t came to '&s;ave his people from their &s;ins;' they who make that confe&s;&s;ion, acknowledge they are not of that number; for if they are mi&s;erable &s;inners, they certainly are not &s;aved from their &s;ins, however they may attempt to reconcile &s;o plain a contradiction. This is a lan|guage not confined to a particular part of the &s;ervice; the in|con&s;i&s;tency of the whole appears equally obvious; as at one time confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins and wickedne&s;&s;es; then called upon to ad|dre&s;s the mo&s;t High, with pure, humble, penitent, and obedient hearts; one while returning thanks for creation, pre&s;ervation and redemption; again acknowledging having erred and &s;trayed like lo&s;t &s;heep; de&s;iring to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e not only with
<PB N="57" REF="035518_0056_10055BA35FFFD178">
their lips, but in their lives, by giving them&s;elves up to his &s;ervice, and walking before him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s all their days; but &s;till mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do, &amp;c. Can this running backwards and forwards, one time &s;aying one thing, another time quite the contrary, be acceptable &s;ervice to that God, who &s;earcheth the heart, tri|eth the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins, and requireth truth in the inward parts? Again, in repeating the experiences of the royal P&s;almi&s;t, how is it po&s;|&s;ible but many gro&s;s fal&s;ehoods mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed? For if the words of the mouth do not expre&s;s the real experimental lan|guage of the heart, however excellent they may be yet they are to tho&s;e who utter them, not the language of truth but of fal&s;ehood. I &s;hould hope a little &s;erious con&s;ideration will con|vince of this.</P>
<P>Again, re&s;pecting the cu&s;tom or practice of &s;inging, I have a few ob&s;ervations to make. How incon&s;i&s;tent is it, that they who have ju&s;t before been confe&s;&s;ing their mi&s;ery and wretch|edne&s;s, &s;hould appear &s;o quickly and ea&s;ily to forget all, and be|gin &s;inging. Surely it &s;eems evidently to declare, they were not &s;incere in their acknowledgments, or that they think it of very little con&s;equence whether their prayers are an&s;wered or not. Be&s;ides, not only the manner to me appears ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent: but the matter in many quite contrary to truth, and to what has been ju&s;t before openly avowed. I could &s;pe|cify many in&s;tances in every collection I have &s;een, but I wi&s;h people to &s;earch for them&s;elves. Surely this is trifling with &s;erious things. I am fully per&s;uaded that the common practice of &s;inging is only calculated to amu&s;e the creature, to plea&s;e the outward ear; whatever may be pretended of its warming the heart and kindling devotion. And if tho&s;e who practi&s;e it would be hone&s;t and candid, I am of opinion they would be con&s;trained to acknowledge that <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> is the chief object; or why &s;o plea&s;ed with tunes and mu&s;ic? Can it for a moment be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Almighty is to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch &s;u|perficial
<PB N="58" REF="035518_0057_10055BA5165170A0">
conduct? Surely not, And with re&s;pect to its kindling devotion, it may be well to remember what is &s;aid of tho&s;e, "who kindle a fire, and encompa&s;s them&s;elves about with &s;parks; they may walk in the light thereof, but they &s;hall lie down in &s;orrow," I&s;a. l. 11. I readily admit what is advanced to defend this cu&s;tom, that our Lord and his di&s;ciples, the night before he &s;uffered, &s;ang a hymn, but what or how we are not informed; no doubt the matter and manner were both proper and &s;ea&s;onable; and that Paul and Silas, in pri&s;on, "&s;ang prai&s;es to the Lord," I believe; but I cannot conceive what argument can be deduced from thence for the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of &s;inging whatever may be given out, &s;uitable or not, whether prai&s;e, profe&s;&s;ion, acknowledgment or petition. I fully believe this outward incon&s;iderate &s;inging is very different from that recom|mended by the apo&s;tle, "Singing with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding, 1 Cor. xiv. 15. "Singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord," Eph. v. 19. And I al&s;o believe, that the true &s;ource of prai&s;e, even a greatful &s;en&s;e of the Lord's mercies, can be more con&s;i&s;tently expre&s;&s;ed than in outward jingle and &s;ound.</P>
<P>Indeed, my friends, I fear you are, many of you, agreeably to your own confe&s;&s;ion, in a mi&s;erable condition. Suffer me to prevail upon you to con&s;ider, whether your continuing year after year mi&s;erable &s;inners, is not the con&s;equence of your prayers not being heard; and let a concern ari&s;e to en|quire, whether you have been &s;eeking aright or not: for our Lord promi&s;ed plainly and expre&s;sly, "that they who &s;eek &s;hall find," Matt. vii. 5. Now, what have they found, who continue as they acknowledge, 'mi&s;erable &s;inners having no health in them &amp;c? Do they not rather confe&s;s that the means they have u&s;ed are in&s;ufficient to clean&s;e and heal them; that they have not rightly applied to the great phy&s;ician, to the balm of Gilead, "to that tree, who&s;e leaves are for the healing of the nations; but have been &s;pending their money for that which is not bread, and their Labour for that which &s;ati&s;|fieth not; in&s;tead of hearkening diligently unto the Lord, and eating that which is good;" I&s;a. lv. 2. that true bread of life,
<PB N="59" REF="035518_0058_10055BA7F62BEB80">
which our Lord &s;aid, "who&s;oever eat thereof &s;hould live fore|ver?" John vi. 58. It may be well to have recour&s;e to the&s;e means before the po&s;&s;ibility of cure is denied; le&s;t they thereby deny the power of God, that he is not able to "ca&s;t out the &s;trong man armed, who keepeth his palace and his goods in peace," Luke xi 21. I think I need not add, who is there meant by the &s;trong man armed, where is his palace, and what are his goods. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome, "who had a form of godline&s;s but denied the power thereof." 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, it may be well to con&s;ider, in what can the power of godli|ne&s;s be known, but in dominion over its adver&s;ary, which is &s;in. And do not they who deny the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ins being &s;ubdued, deny the power of godline&s;s? A &s;erious con&s;ideration may not be unprofitable. I have often admired, that tho&s;e who plead for &s;in pretend highly to value the &s;criptures, and &s;ay, 'the &s;criptures is the rule;' whereas the &s;criptures uniformly in&s;i&s;t upon the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s; not an imaginary holine&s;s, but a real purity of heart and of life. "Without holine&s;s," &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Heb. xii. 14. "Be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation, becau&s;e it is written, Be ye holy for I am holy," 1. Pet. i. 15. "Pre&s;ent your bodies, (mark, your bodies) a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice," Rom. xii. 1. They talk much of the blood of Chri&s;t; it is a &s;ubject often in the mouth, but what of the nature and effects of it is known, let their own acknowledgments te&s;tify. The apo&s;tle declares it clean&s;eth from all &s;in," 1 John i. vii. Now how tho&s;e who continue 'mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c can be clean&s;ed from all &s;in, let the con&s;iderate judge.</P>
<P>It is with me now, to an&s;wer &s;ome objections to this impor|tant truth; and to remark on &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which tho&s;e who deny the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in being &s;ubdued, endeavour to cover them&s;elves with. Fir&s;t, that 'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked, who can
<PB N="60" REF="035518_0059_10055BAA4787FE68">
know it?' Jer. xvii. 9. That the heart of every man, of every natural unregenerate man, is truely &s;o, I firmly believe: but be it remembered that the Lord promi&s;ed to give his people a new heart and a new &s;pirit: Ezek. xxxvi. 26. And dare any one &s;ay, that heart is deceitful and wicked? O, beware of de|preciating the gift of God. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart' &s;aith our Lord, for they &s;hall &s;ee God." Matt. v. 8. "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." Mark vii. 18. "The &s;eed on the good ground are they who in an hone&s;t and good heart, hav|ing heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with pati|ence." Luke viii. 15. For now, in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the axe is laid to the root of the tree, Matt. iii. 10. What is the root of the tree there alluded to but the heart, from whence words and actions have their birth? "Thou blind Phari&s;ee," &s;aid Chri&s;t, "clean&s;e fir&s;t that which is within the cup and the platter, that the out&s;ide may be clean al&s;o" Matt. xxiii. 26. And do they not in the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed form, pray that God, 'would clean&s;e the thoughts of their hearts, by the in&s;piration of his holy &s;pi|rit" a mo&s;t excellent petition; but what is it in tho&s;e who u&s;e it and yet deny the po&s;&s;ibility of its being an&s;wered, but a &s;o|lemn mockery? For if the thoughts of the heart are really clean&s;ed, there can be no &s;in, for &s;in defiles and pollutes the heart.</P>
<P>Another objection, is the language of the apo&s;tle, where he &s;peaks of 'a law in his members warring again&s;t the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of &s;in, and that in his fle&s;h dwelt no good thing, Rom. vii. That the a|po&s;tle once was in that &s;tate, I think, is beyond a doubt; and that every real Chri&s;tian experiences a &s;imilar, till the &s;trong man armed is ca&s;t out, and the old leaven purged away. But that he was &s;o at the time of waiting it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o me appears by no means credible, from what he has written ju&s;t before and after; or he mu&s;t gro&s;sly contradict him&s;elf, which will hardly be allowed? but rather that he was de&s;cribing the effects of the law upon the carnal unregenerate mind: for he &s;ays, "The
<PB N="61" REF="035518_0060_10055BAC8EA7ADB0">
law is &s;piritual, but I am carnal, &s;old under &s;in." Now can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the apo&s;tle was then carnal? &amp;c. Surely not, For ju&s;t after, he &s;ays. 'the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, and 'to be carnal minded is death.' chap. viii. 6.7. and that "they who are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God;" but he adds, "Ye are not in the fle&s;h, but in the &s;pirit, if the &s;pirit of God dwell in you; and if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his." It con&s;equently follows, that if the apo&s;tle was then in a carnal &s;tate, he was none of Chri&s;t's, but at enmity again&s;t God. A little before, he &s;ays, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of &s;in might be de&s;troy|ed, that henceforth we &s;hould not &s;erve &s;in: for he that is dead is freed from &s;in, " chap. vi. 6.7. And in the 2nd ver&s;e, "How &s;hall we that are dead to &s;in, live any longer therein." And in the 22nd ver&s;e, "Being made free from &s;in, and become &s;er|vants to God, ye have your fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end e|verla&s;ting life."</P>
<P>Now let this plain language, both before and after, written no boubt at the &s;ame time, determine whether the apo&s;tle was then in a carnal unregenerate &s;tate or not. And though he el&s;ewhere &s;ays, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect;" Phil. iii. 10. I think it in no re&s;pect fa|vours the con&s;truction many put upon it, that the apo&s;tle was then in a &s;inful &s;tate, but rather makes again&s;t them, as it plain|ly condemns the notion, of being perfectly and for ever ju&s;tifiable by mere imputation, and evinces the danger of &s;itting down at ea&s;e, re&s;ting &s;atisfied with an imaginary ju&s;tification. For in another place, &s;peaking of the Chri&s;tian progre&s;s, he &s;ays, though he did not run as uncertainly, or fight as one that beateth the air, yet he found it nece&s;&s;ary to keep under his body and bring it into &s;ubjection, or there was a danger, notwith&s;tanding he had preached to others, of his being &s;till a ca&s;t away, 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27. Another objection is, the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;ays, "By grace ye are &s;aved, through faith, and that not of your&s;elves? it is the gift of God, not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t." Eph. ii. 8, 9. In an&s;wer to which, I believe it is very nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="62" REF="035518_0061_10055BAE201D7750">
di&s;tingui&s;h between the works of man, which he does in his own will and &s;trength, and tho&s;e works which are wrought of God. Perhaps it is not rightly knowing this di&s;tinction that people cry out again&s;t works us though they were all a &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s. The works of man, of the unrenewed carnal mind, yea the be&s;t of them, are as filthy rags; but I think there &s;hould be a great care not to join the works of God (tho&s;e which he worketh in his people) with man's own works; for in the next ver&s;e the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Ye are his workman|&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them." That it is by grace, I believe, no real Chri&s;tian will deny, but will, with humble gratitude in all his progre&s;s, acknowledge with the a|po&s;tle, "by the grace of God I am what I am," 1 Cor. xv, 10. This grace the &s;ame apo&s;tle declared, hath appeared to all men, (mark that, not to any particular part) and teaches, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world. He does not &s;ay (it teaches) we mu&s;t continue in &s;in, "What," &s;ays he in another place, "&s;hall we continue in &s;in, that grace may abound, God forbid," Rom. vi. 1. That it is al&s;o through faith, who will deny? for "without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God," Heb. xi, 6. But the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of a dead faith, James ii. 17. of a faith the devils have, ver&s;e 19. The true faith, he &s;ays, worketh by love, Gal. v. 6. purifieth the heart, Acts xv. 9. and overcometh the world, 1 John v. 4. Now what faith have tho&s;e, who &s;ay, they are 'tied and bound with the chain of their &s;ins, that they are mi&s;erable &s;inners, having no health in them" &amp;c. The tree is known by its fruit.</P>
<P>Again, the words of our Lord, when upon the earth in the days of his fle&s;h, to tho&s;e whom he had healed of their di&s;|ea&s;es, are pleaded in excu&s;e for continuing in &s;in, as "Thy faith hath &s;aved thee, thy faith hath made thee whole, &amp;c. But be it remembered, that tho&s;e to whom he &s;aid &s;o were com|pletely cured, received 'perfect &s;oundne&s;s;' and, I believe,
<PB N="63" REF="035518_0062_10055BAFAC488858">
there is a remnant at this day, who witne&s;s the &s;ame works, &s;piritually accompli&s;hed by the powerful operation of the &s;ame word in the heart, even a being made whole, a being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the great di&s;ea&s;e of &s;in, prefigured by the various cures performed on the bodies of the people.</P>
<P>Once more, another argument adduced is where the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "If we &s;ay we have no &s;in we deceive our&s;elves and the truth is not in us," 1 John i. 8. But a due attention to what follows, I think will clearly explain, that the apo&s;tle does not favour the idea that he was then in that &s;tate; for he adds, 'if we &s;ay we have &s;inned,' plainly alluding to time pa&s;t, and conti|nues, "if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;" and as all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in, chap. v. 16. they who are clean&s;ed from all, &s;urely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have none remaining. It is the &s;incere de|&s;ire of my mind, that the people would con&s;ider for them|&s;elves, and not take things of &s;uch importance upon tru&s;t, but attend to the advice of the apo&s;tle, "Let every man prove his own work, then &s;hall he have rejoicing in him&s;elf, and not in another, for every man &s;hall bare his own burden." Gal. vi. 4, 5. "Be not deceived," he adds ju&s;t after, "God is not mocked; what&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he reap," what|ever be his opinion, knowledge or faith. And in another place he &s;ays, though he had all knowledge, could under&s;tand all my&s;|teries, though he had all faith, even to remove mountains, yet he might be as nothing, 1 Cor. xiii. 2. Therefore it might be well to have a care of talking &s;o highly of the &s;criptures, while the life and conver&s;ation is not agreeable thereto; and remember the words of our Lord to &s;ome of old, "Search the &s;criptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which te&s;tify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," John v. 39.40. From which it appears, and is worthy the mo&s;t &s;erious attention, that tho&s;e who had the &s;criptures and valued them, as to think they had eternal life in them, yet they would not come unto Chri&s;t, of whom they te&s;tified; and "who was and is alone the life as
<PB N="64" REF="035518_0063_10055BB20A9C04C8">
well as the light of men," John i. 4. Therefore it may be well to take care of putting the letter, the te&s;timony, the decla|ration, concerning an object, for the object it&s;elf; for our Lord did not &s;ay the &s;criptures is the way; but "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6. And learn the difference between the let|ter, the outward word, and the word that was in the beginning, John i. 1, before the &s;criptures, "the word high in the mouth, and in the heart;" Rom. x. 8, "which is quick and powerful, &s;harper than a two-edged &s;word, dividing a&s;under &s;oul and &s;pirit, joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, before whom all things are naked and open," Heb. iv. 12. and of whom, as I before ob&s;erved, the &s;criptures te&s;tify; and without who&s;e all powerful aid they re|main a dead letter, a &s;ealed book. The apo&s;tle declared, the things of God can only be known but by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 11. They are fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural man. There|fore I think we &s;hould be careful how we attempt to compre|hend the truths, which are contained in the &s;criptures by our own under&s;tandings; but rather be willing, as the apo&s;tle re|commends, to become fools, that we may be truely wi&s;e, 1 Cor. iii. 18.</P>
<P>I would now offer a few remarks on tho&s;e two ordinances or ceremonies, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper as they are cal|led.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, as practi&s;ed by tho&s;e I more parti|cularly addre&s;s my&s;elf to, little need be &s;aid; as &s;prinkling in|fants is not even an imitation of true bapti&s;m, has no relation to it whatever, nor do I believe, can there be found a &s;ingle precept or example for it in any of the &s;criptures of truth. I am well per&s;uaded it is, like many other things of the kind, a mere po|pi&s;h invention, in the times of darkne&s;s and apo&s;tacy, as a &s;ub|&s;titute for the reality; not in any one re&s;pect calculated to an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e whatever. It may be well &s;eri|ou&s;ly to con&s;ider a language u&s;ed at that ceremony, that 'this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="65" REF="035518_0064_10055BB5D2A869B8">
church;' and in the catechi&s;m re&s;pecting it, that 'he is therein made a member of Chri&s;t, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven.' Now let every con&s;iderate per&s;on &s;olemnly a&s;k him&s;elf, whether he really believes &s;uch effects are really produced by it. If it is po&s;&s;ible that any one can think &s;o, his ideas of regeneration, and Chri&s;t's church al&s;o, differ very widely from mine.</P>
<P>Let it be con&s;idered al&s;o, what people are taught to promi&s;e at this ceremony: To renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;in|ful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h; to keep God's holy will and command|ments, and to walk in the &s;ame all the days of their lives.' Are they not here required to promi&s;e what is believed and confe&s;&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible to perform; for &s;urely if it was per|formed, they would not 'be mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>That bapti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for every member of Chri&s;t's church, I fully believe; but I believe, no application of water, even when rightly imitated, is the one true bapti&s;m. It is not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, which is all outward elementary water can do, but the bap|ti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t and of Fire,' Matt iii. 11, even a being baptized in the name, that is nature, of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, thereby experiencing the con&s;uming of the earth|ly part in them&s;elves, and a being clean&s;ed and purified from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of the Lord; for the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "As many as are baptized into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t, "Gal. iii. 27. not imaginarily, but really; and being buried with him, by this &s;piritual bapti&s;m into death, even a death unto &s;in: that "like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead; by the glory of the Father, &s;o they al&s;o will walk in the newne&s;s of life," Rom. vi 4. And again, If any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature, old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, all things become new, and all of God:" 2 Cor. v.
<PB N="66" REF="035518_0065_10055BB75AA672E0">
17. and if all of God, there can be no &s;in, for "&s;in is of the de|vil, and not of God." 1 John iii. 8.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to that other ceremony, called the Lord's Sup|per, notwith&s;tanding I am &s;en&s;ible of the deep rooted prejudice in favour of it, I feel no di&s;couragement: under a belief that a glorious day is dawning, when clouds and &s;hadows, &s;igns and appearances, &s;hall give place to reality, to the pure e&s;&s;ential &s;ub&s;tance. I am perfectly &s;atisfied in mine own mind re&s;pecting it, and will endeavour to give my rea&s;ons, why I believe it is not of that con&s;equence or obligation many fix upon it.</P>
<P>That our Lord, the night before he &s;uffered, took bread and brake it, and gave to his di&s;ciples, as al&s;o the cup, I believe; and that he &s;aid, this do in rememberance of me; but that he en|joined it to be an ordinance I cannot find. I pre&s;ume it will be allowed to be a part of the fea&s;t of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over, as our Lord &s;aid, "With de&s;ire, I have de&s;ired to eat this pa&s;&s;over with you, before I &s;uffer," Luke xxii. 10. and which was a re|markable type or figure of Chri&s;t, who was the very Pa&s;chal Lamb, the &s;ub&s;tance or antitype it&s;elf. That the bread and wine, as a part of the pa&s;&s;over, repre&s;ented the body and blood of Chri&s;t, to be broken and &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, I pre&s;ume will al&s;o be allowed. Now as there is certainly a very e&s;&s;ential difference between the &s;ign and the thing &s;igni|fied, let us con&s;ider a little, which is of mo&s;t con&s;equence, or whether both are of obligation. I expect none to whom I ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf will deny, that Chri&s;t was and is really the &s;ub|&s;tance and antitype of every type and figure, under the Mo|&s;aic ceremonial di&s;pen&s;ation. This then being one of tho&s;e fi|gures repre&s;enting the death of Chri&s;t; the &s;ub&s;tance being come, the type fulfilled, what need of the &s;hadow; why not give place, as others are acknowledged to do? The apo&s;tle, writ|ing to &s;ome, remarks, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death, till he come." 1 Cor. xi. 26. But this I think, by no means implies that it was an enjoined ordinance, but rather, that tho&s;e to whom he was writing, continued in the u&s;e or ob&s;ervance of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over
<PB N="67" REF="035518_0066_10055BBB082BE758">
This I think, cannot appear improbable, when it is con|&s;idered, that for a time it was taught by &s;ome of the di&s;ciples, that "it was needful to be circumci&s;ed, and to keep the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of Mo&s;es," Acts xv. 5. of cour&s;e this among the re&s;t. There|fore it appears to me, that they, as yet, knew not, in a &s;piritu|al &s;en&s;e, the coming of Chri&s;t; that is, his &s;piritual appearance in their hearts: an inference which &s;eems to be confirmed by what is recorded of &s;ome, who had been baptized with John's bapti&s;m, that is of water, yet had not &s;o much as heard whe|ther there were an Holy Gho&s;t, Acts xix 2. the promi&s;ed mode of his coming again, John xvi. 7. Again, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, &s;peak|ing unto wi&s;e men, no doubt &s;piritually wi&s;e, "The cup of ble&s;&s;ing we ble&s;s, is it not the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t? The bread we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chri&s;t?" 1 Cor. x. 15.16. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he here alludes to outward bread and wine? for if he did, all who par|take of that ceremony, let them be who they may, or what they may, have communion with Chri&s;t. Surely that would be join|ing light and darkne&s;s, Chri&s;t and Belial, righteou&s;ne&s;s and un|righteou&s;ne&s;s together, in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ame apo|&s;tle's plain declaration to the &s;ame people. 2. Cor vi. xv. He &s;ays again, "Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and the table of devils." 1 Cor. x. 20. Now it is very ob|vious, that any can partake of the outward bread and wine, therefore that cannot be the cup and table of the Lord. Again, what is recorded of the di&s;ciples breaking bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, Acts ii. 24, I think by no means implies &s;uch a ceremony, but rather a &s;ocial way of living among them|&s;elves; as it is &s;aid, they had all things common ver&s;e 44 and, from what immediately follows, "did eat their meat with glad|ne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart," ver&s;e 46, plainly alluding to their common meals. It is al&s;o I think, very ob&s;ervable, that when the apo&s;tles were a&s;&s;embled at Jeru&s;alem, to con&s;ider what was nece&s;&s;ary to be enjoined to the believing Gentiles, this cere|mony
<PB N="68" REF="035518_0067_10055BBD6F8F2BC0">
was not even mentioned: which had it been nece&s;&s;ary, would &s;ure not have been omitted, con&s;idering the things which were then enjoined; mo&s;t of which have &s;ince been laid a&s;ide, Acts xv. 20. But our Lord's own words appear to me decidedly to di&s;countenance the outward &s;ign; as where he emphatically calls him&s;elf the "Bread of Life." "That his fle&s;h is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, and that who|&s;oever ate and drank it had eternal life." John vi. 46, &amp;c. And to reprove their carnal ideas of outward eating and drink|ing, ver&s;e 52. and to direct their minds to the &s;piritual allu&s;i|on, he adds, "What, and if you &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man a&s;|cend up where he was before," ver&s;e 62, how will ye eat him then, not in outward bread and wine, "it is the &s;pirit that quickeneth, the fle&s;h (or outward food) profiteth nothing."</P>
<P>I believe there are among tho&s;e whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf to, &s;uch as are &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;piritual communion, and are truly de&s;irous to partake thereof. Far be it from me to wound any of the&s;e. I do tenderly &s;alute them, and feel a degree of unity with the lea&s;t appearance of the true &s;eed of the kingdom: I would not hurt the lead plant of the Lord's own right hand planting. However &s;ome little differences may ap|pear, yet let me &s;ay to the&s;e in a &s;pirit of love and unity, as this is acknowledged to be but a &s;ign or token, why is this con|tinued, when others of equal authority and obligation are di&s;|pen&s;ed with? For in&s;tance, that of circumci&s;ion, which our Lord &s;ubmitted to, Luke ii. 21; and which for a time, even after his a&s;cen&s;ion, was enjoined by his di&s;ciples as I before quoted; Why this laid a&s;ide? It may perhaps be an&s;wered, this &s;ign according to the apo&s;tle's definition of it, repre&s;ented the circumci&s;ion made without hands, in putting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, Col. ii 11. I fully believe it did, and as it is equally true that bread and wine is al&s;o a &s;ign, there appears to me not a &s;hadow of a rea&s;on why the one &s;hould be continued in preference to the other: the thing &s;ignified by both being of equal obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="035518_0068_10055BBFD3ABE380">
Again, it is worthy of ob&s;ervation that the beloved di&s;ciple John, in his relation, makes not the lea&s;t mention of this cere|mony; but is very particular in giving an account of our Lord's wa&s;hing his di&s;ciples feet. Why is not this ceremony ob&s;erved, as it appears to be more particularly enjoined than the other? For &s;ays Chri&s;t "Ye call me Ma&s;ter, and Lord and ye &s;ay well, for &s;o I am; if I then your Lord and Ma&s;ter have wa&s;h|ed your feet, ye ought al&s;o to wa&s;h one another's feet, for I have given you an example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done unto you" John xiii. 13. Now where can there be found &s;o &s;trong an injunction for the other, that of bread and wine? If it is an&s;wered, that was a &s;ign or figure to teach humility and love to each other which I readily admit it was. I think it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that the other is &s;omewhat more than a &s;ign, to &s;up|port its continuance in preference; which I expect will hard|ly be attempted. That it was not practi&s;ed or ob&s;erved as an ordinance by the apo&s;tles, I think evidently appears from the whole tenor of their writings. Paul reproves &s;ome for being &s;ubject to ordinances. "Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not," &s;ays he, "which all are to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing." Col. ii. 20. and doth not outward bread and wine peri&s;h with the u&s;ing? The apo&s;tle well knew the true living bread is not of a peri&s;h|able nature. Again, he &s;ays, "Let no man judge you in meat and in drink, or in re&s;pect to the holy day, new moon, or the &s;ab|bath, which" he adds, "are a &s;hadow of things to come, but the body, (the &s;ub&s;tance) is of Chri&s;t, ver&s;e 16. In another place he &s;ays, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." Rom. xiv. 17. And to &s;ome others he &s;aid "I am afraid of you, left I have be&s;towed on you labour in vain," becau&s;e af|ter they had known God, had ta&s;ted &s;omewhat of the &s;ub&s;tance, they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereun|to they de&s;ired again to be in bondage. Gal iv 9. "Ye ob&s;erve days, and months, and times, and years." ver&s;e 10, &s;aid he, which he had declared to be but &s;hadows of good things; and I fear the &s;ame language is too applicable to many, who make a very high profe&s;&s;ion in this day.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="035518_0069_10055BC1D7B1C7D8">
From what I have ob&s;erved on this &s;ubject, I think to an un|prejudiced mind, it mu&s;t appear that the true &s;upper of the Lord is an inward, &s;piritual communion. "Behold," &s;ays Chri&s;t, "I &s;tand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me," Rev. iii. 20; and that the outward bread and wine, was nothing more than a part of the Jewi&s;h ce|remonial di&s;pen&s;ation; neither commanded to, nor practi&s;ed generally by, the Gentiles in the apo&s;tle's days. For, I would ju&s;t add, if it is a nece&s;&s;ary ordinance; if in other words, it is what by many it is a&s;&s;erted to be, the effects of it would be e|vident; for our Lord &s;aid, "Who&s;oever ate his fle&s;h and drank his blood, had eternal life." Now I pre&s;ume no one to whom I now addre&s;s my&s;elf, will impute &s;uch an effect to outward bread and wine; therefore it cannot be the Lord's &s;upper. We no where read of two &s;uppers. The difference between the &s;ign and thing &s;ignified, the &s;hadow and the &s;ub&s;tance, I be|lieve many are in a degree &s;en&s;ible of; and as the &s;ub&s;tance, the reality is to be partaken of, yea ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; (for &s;aid our Lord, "Except ye eat the fle&s;h of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;" John vi. 53.) and as I before ob&s;erved we read of but <HI>one</HI> &s;upper of the Lord; &s;urely it is of con&s;equence rightly to know which is indeed the true &s;upper.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but there are tho&s;e who in &s;incerity and up|rightne&s;s of heart continue in the u&s;e of the &s;ign; far be it from me to judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;e. I have only a caution to give in love, that where the&s;e &s;igns are regarded, it may be as to the Lord, and and not unto men. See Rom xiv. 6. I fully believe religion doth not con&s;i&s;t in ob&s;erving, or not ob&s;erving, outward cere|monies. For as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion; but a new creature;" Gal. vi. 15. It is not a name, a profe&s;&s;ion, or any outward ob&s;ervance; but I am not without a fear that many regard them as to men, and are in bondage unto them, and &s;o &s;ettled down at ea&s;e in them, that they will hardly hear

the lea&s;t objection to them. Such perhaps mu&s;t be left for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time: however, I have given &s;ome of my rea&s;ons for ab&s;enting my&s;elf from your communion, and why I believe the wor&s;hip there performed, <HI>is not the wor&s;hip which the Lord requireth;</HI> that it is not agreeable, but contrary to, the Scriptures; that it is not the means of grace, and ordinance of God" but the in|vention and imagination of man; that it is wrong in principle and in practice; in <HI>principle,</HI> becau&s;e you are taught you mu&s;t not expect deliverance from &s;in in this life, whereas the &s;criptures te&s;tify the contrary; <HI>in practice,</HI> becau&s;e you wor&s;hip in your own wills, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men, which our Lord te&s;tified again&s;t; Mark vii. 7: yea in an unre|generate &s;tate, according to your own confe&s;&s;ion, for a &s;inner is not regenerate. Therefore, what I have heard among you, that your be&s;t &s;ervices are polluted, is &s;trictly true; for while you your&s;elves are in the polluted &s;tate, all your performances are polluted al&s;o. "For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean; not one," Job xiv. 4; but it may be well to re|member, it &s;tands an unchangeable truth, "That the &s;acrifices of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord," Prov. xxi. 27. and though we may amu&s;e our&s;elves with the vain idea that all is well, I do a&s;&s;uredly believe, that to offer any acceptable &s;acrifice or &s;ervice, we mu&s;t know, experimentally know, a being wa&s;hed, &s;anctified, and ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God. 1 Cor. vi. 11. Therefore remember a language of old to &s;ome who had no health in them, but were un&s;ound from head to foot, as many confe&s;s they now are. "To what purpo&s;e is the multitude of your &s;acrifices," v. 12. "Bring no more vain oblations, incen&s;e is a|bomination to me, the new moons and &s;abbaths, the calling of a&s;&s;emblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity even the &s;olemn meeting. When you &s;pread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes, yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear." ver. 13, 14. And con&s;ider the exhortation to them, "Wa&s;h ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well," &amp;c. ver. 16. Then it is added, "Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall

be white as &s;now: though they be red like crim&s;on they &s;hall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land; but if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be de|voured with the &s;word: for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it." ver. 18. Oh, how awful is this denunciation now fulfill|ing around us! It is the fervent breathing of my &s;pirit, that this highly profe&s;&s;ing, much favoured nation, who have been calling abundantly upon the Lord with their mouths and ho|nouring him with their lips, may avert the impending &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oke, by truly humbling them&s;elves before him? and as his judgments are in the earth, may indeed learn righteou&s;ne&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fa. xxv. 9.</P>
<P>I know, friends, from a degree of experience, that there are many and various appearances &s;igns and &s;hadows, &s;et up a|mong profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians; &s;ome of which I have pointed out. I now wi&s;h to direct, according to the ability I am at pre&s;ent favoured with, to the reality or &s;ub&s;tance it&s;elf; and this in|e&s;timable trea&s;ure which I had long in vain &s;ought for without, among the various appearances, I at la&s;t found to be within. I can anticipate the &s;urpri&s;e, and perhaps the indignation, the word <HI>within</HI> may excite in &s;ome minds, who may be ready to exclaim, Can there be any thing good in man? Yes, friends, the &s;overeign good, the only good, is to be found there; and I de&s;ire your patient attention while I endeavour to remove that unju&s;t, delu&s;ive, yea too de&s;tructive idea, that nothing good is to be found in man. I believe it is the grand artifice, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;inuation, of the great adver&s;ary of man|kind, to divert the attention, from <HI>that</HI> which is alone able ef|fectually to de&s;troy his kingdom or rule in the heart, to objects without, to &s;imilitudes and appearances. (My&s;tery Babylon.) This good then, though in man is not or man, it is not natu|ral to him; but a free, &s;pontaneous, unmerited gift. This good is, with reverence be it &s;poken even God him&s;elf, a truth I believe of the utmo&s;t importance to be experimentally known by every individual; and a truth abundantly te&s;tified to in the &s;acred writings; as the ground work, the &s;ub&s;tance the foun|dation of real religion; a language al&s;o repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed

by the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; though the truth, the reality of it, appears &s;o little known, as by many even to be denied. Do not you frequently read, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people," 2 Cor. vi. 16. "If a man love me," &s;aid our Lord, "he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him," John xiv. 23. "The Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth," proceeding from the Father, &s;aid he, "dwelleth with you and &s;hall be in you," ver. 17. "Know ye not," &s;aid the Apo&s;tle, "that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you except ye be reprobates?" 2 Cor. xiii. 5, and that your bodies are the temples of the living God? 1. Cor. vi. 19. I could multiply quotations of Scriptures, to prove this great important truth, but am &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf are well acquainted with the words. 'You are fre|quently reading, of "Chri&s;t within the hope of glory," Col. i. 27&punc; under various &s;imilitudes; but what is the rea&s;on, he is not known there? it is an important que&s;tion. What is the rea&s;on, I again repeat it, that Chri&s;t &s;o often read of in the Scriptures as within, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much talk and imaginations about him, is not known there in reality? I believe, friends, I can tell you the rea&s;on why he, the one great foundation, is not known, where alone he is truly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e known. Becau&s;e he is not &s;ought for there, but in &s;omething without &s;ome appear|ance or repre&s;entation of him, a knowledge gathered from men or books, from the hi&s;tory or outward letter, which, however highly it may be valued, I believe is merely notional. The real experimental knowledge is only known by his internal appear|ance, his &s;econd coming, without &s;in, unto &s;alvation; Heb. ix. 23, and the operation and effects thereby produced. See Mal. iii, 3. "The kingdom of God," &s;aid our Lord, "cometh not by ob&s;ervation:" man with all his wi&s;dom, is unable to com|prehend it, neither &s;hall they &s;ay, "Lo here is Chri&s;t, or lo there," not in any outward appearance, "for behold the king|dom of God is within you." Luke xvii, 20, 21. "Say not in

thine heart," &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven that is to bring Chri&s;t down from above, or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the deep, that is to bring Chri&s;t again from the dead:" He is not at a di&s;tance, but "the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart. Rom. x. 6, 7, 8. Our Lord repre&s;ented this great truth by various objects or &s;imilitudes, to convey &s;piritual in&s;truction to his di&s;ciples; as a trea&s;ure hid in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ield; Mat. xiii, 44, &s;eed &s;own in the ground; Mark iv. 26, a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed; Mat. xiii. 31, a little leaven hid in meal; ver. 33. plainly alluding to this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure as hid in the heart, the earthly part of man. There were &s;ome of whom our Lord &s;aid, having ears they heard not; they could not under&s;tand the &s;piritual meaning of his parables; but to &s;ome he &s;aid, "Unto you it is given to know the my&s;teries of the kingdom of God." Mark iv. 11. Now, friends, it is of con&s;equence to know of which number we are, whether the&s;e are &s;till to us as parables, or whether we know <HI>that</HI> which un&s;olds their true meaning: "I am the light of the world;" &s;aid Chri&s;t, "he that followeth me &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s, but &s;hall have the light of life." John viii. 12.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle &s;ays there is no communion between light and darkne&s;s. 2 Cor. vi. 14. If we have not light, we mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be in darkne&s;s. There is a &s;piritual light, as well as a natural. This great apo&s;tle to the Gentiles, declaring his com|mi&s;&s;ion to preach the go&s;pel, &s;aid it was to turn people from darkne&s;s, to light, from the power of &s;atan unto God. Acts xxvi. 18. Of what con&s;equence then is it to be acquainted with this light, by which alone we can di&s;cern between good and evil. "All things." &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "that are reproved, are made manife&s;t by the light; for what&s;oever doth make manife&s;t is light." Eph. v. 13. That we may know what this light is the &s;criptures abundantly declare. John the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent to bear witne&s;s of this light, which is the true light, which light|eth every man that cometh into the world. John 1. 8, 9. In him, i. e. Chri&s;t was life, and the life was the light of men. ver. 4. This light &s;hineth in darkne&s;s, even the dark heart of man;
<PB N="75" REF="035518_0074_10055BCD3456F8B8">
though the darkne&s;s comprehended it not. ver. 5. This is the light of the glorious go&s;pel; therefore, friends, I caution you to beware of calling it a natural light, or a new lights, as many have done. For I believe the &s;ame light, if attended to and its di&s;coveries obeyed, will eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the &s;ame works &s;piritually in the heart, or inner man, as it formerly did on the bodies of the peo|ple. Therefore I believe there is great danger of &s;peaking evil of the light, for whoever do, confe&s;s they are &s;trangers to it, and of cour&s;e are walking in darkne&s;s, for there is but one true &s;piritual light. And "If we &s;ay we have fellow&s;hip with him and walk in darkne&s;s, <HI>we</HI> lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow&s;hip one with another, and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;on, clean&s;eth us from all &s;in." 1. John, i. 6, 7.</P>
<P>Our Lord him&s;elf plainly declared, that "Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved; but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in God." John. iii. 20, 21. Therefore it is not &s;trange that tho&s;e who plead for &s;in, which is evil, &s;hould &s;peak again&s;t this light, and call it a natural light; or any thing, to excu&s;e them&s;elves; becau&s;e it cannot but condemn them. Tho&s;e things which the light, if attended to, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ould manife&s;t to be evil, are too dearly loved, to be parted with, while they can per&s;uade them&s;elves they are &s;ecure in retaining them. I &s;peak from ex|perience, and do earne&s;tly recommend a turning to this light within from all the <HI>'Lo heres,'</HI> and <HI>'Lo theres:'</HI> the various appearances, &s;igns, and &s;hadows, &s;et up by the will and wi&s;dom of men, in the times of darkne&s;s and apo&s;tacy; even to <HI>Chri&s;t within,</HI> the hope of glory, the true foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 11; the rock again&s;t which even the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail, Mat. xvi. 18; nor all the oppo&s;ition of men, as it is faithfully abode in. This I believe is the &s;ub&s;tance of every &s;hadow, the reality of every appearance, the word nigh in the mouth and in the heart; the true anointing, which is truth and no lie, and
<PB N="76" REF="035518_0075_10055BCF653E7C20">
which teacheth all things without need of man's teaching. 1. John ii. 27. This is the new covenant, graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed by the Mo&s;t High. "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people; and they &s;hall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, Know the Lord, for they &s;hall all know me from the lea&s;t of them unto the greate&s;t of them, &s;aith the Lord." Jer. xxxi. 33, 34.</P>
<P>Behold, &s;aid our Lord, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke xvii. 21. The &s;eed of the kingdom which is &s;own in the hearts, though too &s;mall for the eye of man's wi&s;dom to di&s;co|ver, though it is &s;till to the high profe&s;&s;ing Jew a &s;tumbling block, and to the worldly wi&s;e Greek fooli&s;hne&s;s; yet it is to tho&s;e who hear its call and obey it, Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God. 1. Cor. i. 23, 24. This I believe is the new birth, without which our Lord declared no one even could &s;ee the kingdom of God. John iii. 3. The birth which is not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God, John, i. 13. For that which is born of the fle&s;h, however high and &s;pecious its appearance, is &s;till fle&s;h; and that which is born of the &s;pirit, however mean and contempti|ble in the eye of man's wi&s;dom, is &s;pirit. The go&s;pel is a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation. The &s;pirit of truth inwardly manife&s;ted, our Lord promi&s;ed &s;hould guide into all truth. John xvi. 13. The apo&s;tles were not to leave Jeru&s;alem till they had received it. Acts i. 4. And then we are informed, "They &s;pake as the &s;pirit gave them utterance." Acts ii. 4. We have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they u&s;ed any form of words, neither that they &s;pake when or where they cho&s;e; but we are frequently informed of their going or forbearing; as by the &s;pirit they were directed; Acts viii, 29. xix. 7, &amp;c. neither are we to &s;uppo&s;e that this in|fluence and direction of the &s;pirit was confined to any period of time; for, &s;ays our Lord, "Lo, I am with you alway, even un|to the end of the world." Mat. xxviii. 20. What a departure from their example and precepts is lamentably con&s;picuous among mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians; who have invented various
<PB N="77" REF="035518_0076_10055BD24BEA1450">
images, forms, and modes of wor&s;hip, which they can perform when they plea&s;e; evidently acknowledging that they think the influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit unnece&s;&s;ary; at lea&s;t that they will begin at a venture, whether it may come or not. Surely it may be well to con&s;ider, whether it is not offering &s;trange fire before the Lord. Lev. x. 1. The only <HI>true wor&s;hip</HI> under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is, agreeably to our Lord's ex|pre&s;s declaration, <HI>that which is in &s;pirit and in truth,</HI> John iv. 24, and as the influences and movings of the &s;pirit, (although &s;o ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as that no acceptable wor&s;hip can be per|formed without them) are not at our command; how proper, yea, how needful then, is a humble, &s;ilent, dependent waiting upon Him, who alone can admini&s;ter this a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that there|by the true preparation of the heart may be experienced, to re|ceive whatever He, who &s;earcheth the heart, and who alone knoweth what is good for tho&s;e who wait upon him, may be plea&s;ed to admini&s;ter: whether immediately, by his &s;till &s;mall voice in the &s;ecret of the heart; or in&s;trumentally, by whom|soever he may plea&s;e to appoint!</P>
<P>"They that wait upon the Lord," &s;aid the Prophet, "&s;hall renew their &s;trength." I&s;a. xl. 31. It is the profe&s;&s;ed object of mo&s;t a&s;&s;emblies for religious wor&s;hip, <HI>to wait upon the Lord.</HI> Now, whether tho&s;e who in &s;olemn humble &s;ilence, wait to feel the influences of the &s;pirit, to in&s;truct and enable, when and what to offer, or what immediately to receive from the foun|tain of good, are &s;uch as that promi&s;e applies to; or tho&s;e who are always ready to begin, either in a pre&s;cribed form, or in the exerci&s;e of their own natural or acquired abilities, whether they may have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o nece&s;&s;ary or not; I think a little &s;erious con&s;ideration may determine. Indeed the plain expre&s;s meaning of the term, <HI>Waiting,</HI> appears to me to be a &s;ilent at|tentive expectation of &s;omething; and if it is weightily con&s;i|dered, that, at &s;uch times, we more particularly profe&s;s to ap|proach the &s;acred pre&s;ence of Him, "who &s;earcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts;" who cannot po&s;&s;ibly be deceived or amu&s;ed by the mo&s;t plau&s;ible
<PB N="78" REF="035518_0077_10055BD3E1387C70">
expre&s;&s;ions or the mo&s;t eloquent language; who has decidedly condemned the practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whil&s;t the heart is far from him; I&s;a. xxix. 13. &s;urely it is needful at &s;uch times to wait, &s;ilently wait, for the reception of &s;piritual power, le&s;t we &s;hould be like tho&s;e who offer the &s;acrifice of fools. Eccle&s;. v. 1. "Let not thine heart," &s;aid the wi&s;e man, "be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few." ver. 2. "Without me," &s;aid our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, "ye can do nothing." John xv. 5. Yet the practice of many who profe&s;s to follow him, evidently de|clares that they think they can do without him, for they are, as to words and outward performances, always ready. The apo&s;tle plainly declared, that "we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but it is the &s;pirit that helpeth our infirm|ities." Rom. viii. 26. Then what are all the arts of compo&s;i|tion, and the powers of human eloquence, without this a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but as "&s;ounding bra&s;s or a tinkling cymbal?" "When we pray," &s;aid our Lord, "u&s;e not vain repetitions as the hea|then do: for they think they &s;hall be heard, for their much &s;peaking;" Mat. vi. 7. a language too applicable I fear, not only to the pre&s;cribed formal prayers, but to the more private extempore productions: as though prayer con&s;i&s;ted in outward expre&s;&s;ions, an idea repeatedly condemned in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, after &s;aving we know not what to pray for, adds, "The &s;pirit it&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered," and Chri&s;t called them hypocrites who prayed to be &s;een of men; Mat. vi. 5, and directed his di&s;|ciples to pray in &s;ecret to the father, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret. ver. 6. The apo&s;tle al&s;o recommends a praying always, with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance. Eph. vi. 18. He does not recommend to begin &s;inging as &s;oon as they conclude a prayer. In another place, he exhorts to a "Continuing in&s;tant in prayer;" Rom. xii. 12. again, "Pray without cea&s;ing;" 1. The&s;. v. 17. from all which
<PB N="79" REF="035518_0078_1005560DEA1A2320">
I think it mu&s;t appear that <HI>there may be true prayer without words, and that there may be al&s;o words without prayer.</HI> I believe, there are tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable abilities, a ready flow of words, and a plea&s;ing eloquent delivery, who can at any time when they plea&s;e, deliver what I have heard called an excellent prayer; without waiting to feel that influence, which can alone enable to "pray with the &s;pirit, and with true under&s;tanding;" but though &s;uch exerci&s;es may produce a temporary warmth, both in &s;peaker and hearer, I believe, it will be found to be only a fire of their own kindling, a mere appearance, and not the effects of the live coal from the true altar. I&s;a. vi. 6. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations are equally applicable to every other external performance of wor&s;hip, public or private: for however it may affect the outward ear, yea, and kindle &s;parks as it were pro|ducing a temporary warmth; if it does not proceed from the immediate &s;en&s;ible movings of the &s;pirit of truth, I much fear the appellation of will-wor&s;hip is too applicable to it.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o had a fear, that a language of old, re&s;pecting &s;ome of whom it was &s;aid, "They limited the Holy One of I&s;rael," P&s;a. lxxviii. 41. is applicable to mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ing religious &s;ocie|ties, where any particular man or &s;et of men, a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the exclu&s;ive right of teaching or preaching: a practice I believe totally repugnant to the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and the uniform example and precepts of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. For I fully believe that <HI>no human authority, call, qualification, or or|dination, can make a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. That is the perogative of Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</HI> It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that every individual Chri&s;tian &s;hould be born of the Spirit; John iii. 5. and &s;urely it mo&s;t al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary that the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould, in an e&s;pecial manner, be &s;o too. Paul &s;aid he was made an apo&s;tle, "Not of men, neither by man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and God the Father." Gal. i. 1. And, as I before ob&s;erved, the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel being 'a di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;pirit,' the mini&s;ters thereof are mini&s;ters of the &s;pirit, and not of the letter: not mini&s;ters of the words only, though &s;cripture words them&s;elves; but of the "word of eternal life," even of the "word which
<PB N="80" REF="035518_0079_10055C2792E3F7D0">
was in the beginning, which liveth and abideth for ever." 1. Pet. i. 23. That word which is "quick and powerful, di&s;cern|ing the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12. Words may have, and no doubt have, their &s;ervice, as the &s;pirit brings to rememberance, and giveth utterance; but to &s;teal the words of Scripture, &s;ee Jer. xxiii. 30, 31. and put them in a premedi|tated form, however eloquently they may be delivered, I believe is not preaching the go&s;pel. But I believe that they who are particularly called, qualified, and &s;ent by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as I believe every true mini&s;ter is, will not pre&s;ume to preach or pray, when, where, or what they plea&s;e; but as they are im|mediately moved and directed by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, inwardly revealed; &s;ee Gal. i. 1.16. who can alone know what is needful to be admini&s;tered, and the&s;e as they freely receive, they will, agreeably to our Lord's command, <HI>Freely give,</HI> Mat. x. 8, &amp;c. 'without any view to temporal intere&s;t whatever.'

<P>To conclude: the few ob&s;ervations I have now offered, may perhaps, to unprejudiced minds, be &s;ufficient to evince the in|ward &s;piritual nature of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; and that <HI>&s;igns and figures, all external ceremonial performances, are totally aboli&s;h|ed from that wor&s;hip, which can only be performed in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> John iv. 23, 24.</P>
<P>They may al&s;o evince that the only nece&s;&s;ary qualification for true wor&s;hip, is the influence and direction of the &s;pirit of truth, inwardly revealed: that this nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not confined to time or place, nor to any particular man or &s;et of men.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before la&s;t, which was &s;ent by thy Uncle <HI>Bolton:</HI> There were a great many kind Expre&s;&s;ions in it, and in thy Si&s;ter <HI>Clopton's</HI> likewi&s;e. I acknow|ledge my&s;elf much obliged to you both, and to the whole Fa|mily, for many repeated Kindne&s;&s;es, and if my School had not

engro&s;&s;ed &s;o much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to an&s;wer my dear Friend's Letter e're now, and upon that Ac|count my Delay will be the more excu&s;able.</P>
<P>The News thou ha&s;t heard of my late Change, is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Pro&s;pect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a &s;incere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be &s;ufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, &amp; not cut me off in the Mid&s;t of my Sins and Provocations again&s;t Him; He is long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and &s;ha|dows of Religion, and let me &s;ee in a more illu&s;trious Manner what is the Life and Sub&s;tance of it, as he found me in &s;ome De|gree faithful to that Mea&s;ure of Light and Knowledge he hath be&s;towed on me, whil&s;t I was in the Communion of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> therefore he was plea&s;ed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper My&s;teries of his Kingdom: And I can truly &s;ay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me, and the Truth &s;hines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s; And if I &s;hould now turn my Back upon &s;uch Manife&s;tations as the&s;e, and entangle my&s;elf again with the Yoke of Bondage, &s;urely I &s;hould grieve the Holy Spirit: So that he might ju&s;tly withdraw his kind Operations, and never return more to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort me: For God is not mocked; Religion is a very &s;erious and weigh|ty Thing; Repentance and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is turning to God to be put off till our own Time, Lei&s;ure or Conveniency, but we mu&s;t love and cheri&s;h the lea&s;t Ap|pearance of Chri&s;t, not &s;lighting or de&s;pi&s;ing the Day of &s;mall Things, but embrace the fir&s;t Opportunity of following Chri&s;t in any of his Commands: When he &s;peaks, there is &s;uch Force and Authority in it that we cannot &s;tand to cavil, di&s;pute or a&s;k Que&s;tions; for unle&s;s we will be &s;o ob&s;tinate as to &s;hut our Eyes

again&s;t the Sun, we mu&s;t needs confe&s;s to the Truth of his Doc|trine, and pre&s;ently &s;trike in with it. And therefore, when for &s;everal Weeks I had lived more privately and retiredly in <HI>Lon|don</HI> than was u&s;ual, Fa&s;ting twice or thrice in a Week, or &s;ome|times more, &s;pending my Time in reading the Scriptures and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to re|ceive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Errors of my pa&s;t Life, and was de&s;irous to attain a more excellent Degree of Holine&s;s than I had di&s;co|vered in the <HI>Church of England.</HI> In this religous Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how &s;incere I was, and re&s;igned to him when alone; I wanted him to &s;et me free, and to &s;peak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wearied with the Burthen of Sin: For tho' I had &s;trictly con|formed my&s;elf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and had kept my&s;elf from running into any great or &s;candalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty pre&s;erving me; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;till I had not that Re&s;t and Satisfaction in my&s;elf which I de&s;ired and greatly longed for; I found; when I had examined my State and Condition to God-ward, that Things were not right with me.</P>
<P>As for a &s;ober and plau&s;able Conver&s;ation in the Eye of the World, I knew that was a very ea&s;y Attainment; a good na|tural Temper, with the Advantage of a liberal Education, will quickly furni&s;h a Man with Abilities for that, &s;o that he &s;hall be looked upon as a Saint, and very &s;piritual, when perhaps in Chains of Darkne&s;s, in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the very Bond of Iniquity. If this &s;ort of Righteou&s;ne&s;s would have done; perhaps I might make as fair Preten&s;ions that Way as &s;ome others: But alas! I &s;oon &s;aw the Emptine&s;s and Un&s;atisfacto|rine&s;s of tho&s;e Things: This is a covering that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty, when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's natural Temper, nor his Education, that makes him a good Chri&s;tian; this is not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s,

which the Go&s;pel calls for; nor is this Truth in the inward Parts, which God requires: The heart and Affections mu&s;t be clean&s;ed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; there|fore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Re&s;t in a for|mal Pretence of Holine&s;s; wherein, yet, I &s;aw, to my Grief, Abundance of People wrap'd them&s;elves; &s;lept &s;ecurely and quietly, dreaming of the Felicity of Paradi&s;e, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble them&s;elves any more about Religion: I could not entertain &s;o dangerous an O|pinion as this, for then I &s;hould be tempted to take up my Re&s;t by the Way, whil&s;t I was travelling towards the promi&s;ed Land. I think I made a little Progre&s;s in a holy Life, and through God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s A&s;&s;i&s;tance I awakened &s;ome of my &s;piritual Enemies whil&s;t I lived in the Communion of the national Church. I thank my God, I can truly &s;ay, Whil&s;t I u&s;ed tho&s;e Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread; but &s;till, I cea&s;ed not my earne&s;t Supplication to him in private, that he would &s;hew me &s;omething more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and might perfect Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weak|ne&s;&s;es daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Re&s;oluti|ons to for&s;ake tho&s;e Sins, yet &s;till the Temptation was too &s;trong for me &s;o that often I had Cau&s;e to complain with the Apo&s;tle, in the Bitterne&s;s of my Soul, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> Who &s;hall &s;et me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World and the Devil?

Word or Motion, Ge&s;ture or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his mo&s;t holy Will, as if I &s;aw him &s;tanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thoughts of my Heart next Moment. O divine Life! O &s;eraphiek Soul! O that I could always Stand here! for here is no reflection, no Sorrow, no Repentance! but at God's right Hand there is perfect Peace, and a river of un|&s;peakable joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Je&s;us, and be throughly furni&s;hed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was

in the Country, but more e&s;pecially after I had left my new Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <HI>London:</HI> In this Retirement I hope I may &s;ay, without Boa&s;ting, that I was very devout and Religious, and I found great Comfort and Refre&s;hment in it from the Lord, who let me &s;ee the Beauty of Holine&s;s; and the &s;weetne&s;s that ari&s;es from an humbled morti|fied Life, was then very plea&s;ant to my Ta&s;te, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the Delights and Plea&s;ures of the World.</P>
<P>And now it plea&s;ed God to &s;hew me, that if I would indeed live &s;trictly and holily as becomes the Go&s;pel, then I mu&s;t leave the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but knew not yet which Way to determine my&s;elf, nor to what Body of Men I &s;hould join, who were more orthodox, and more regular in their Lives. As for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, I was &s;o great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I conver&s;ed with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <HI>Foxly</HI> while I was a Curate there, But I never &s;aw the Man, tho' I went &s;everal times to his Hou&s;e on Purpo&s;e to talk with him, and to bring him off from his wild and mad Enthu&s;ia&s;m, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I know it was every where &s;poken again&s;t; he that had a mind to appear more witty and ingenious than the re&s;t, would chu&s;e this for the Subject of his profane Je&s;ts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <HI>Quaker</HI> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was &s;carce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I confe&s;s I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <HI>Quaker's</HI> Charge, I thought that they were &s;ome of the wor&s;t People that ever appeared in the World, and wondered with what Face they could call them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians, &s;ince I was told they denied the fundamental Articles of the Holy Faith, to which I ever bore the highe&s;t Veneration and E&s;teem; and notwith&s;tanding I had always lived at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from that People, and was very zealous in the wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and upon all Occa&s;ions would

&s;peak very honourably of it, moreover was content to &s;uffer &s;ome few Inconveniences upon that Account, (as thou very well knowe&s;t) yet my Father &s;till look'd upon me as inclining to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and &s;ome Years ago &s;ignified to a Friend, he was a|fraid I would become an Enthu&s;ia&s;t; and whil&s;t I was at <HI>Bungan</HI> School he &s;ent me two Books to read that were writ again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> one of which was <HI>John Faldo's,</HI> who hath been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed for it by <HI>William Penn.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I lived in <HI>London</HI> in that private retired Manner (I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my pa&s;t Life, as I had Occa&s;ion to be one Day at a Book-&s;eller's Shop, I happen|ed to ca&s;t my Eye on <HI>Barclay's</HI> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I had a mind to &s;ee what their Principles were, and what Defence they could make for them&s;elves; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, the&s;e People are not &s;o &s;illy and ridiculous, nor maintainers of &s;uch horrid Opinions, as the Authors of the <HI>Snake,</HI> and &s;ome o|thers, would make us believe. I took Barclay home with me, and I read him through in a Week's Time, &s;ave a little Treati&s;e at the End, which I found to be very philo&s;ophical, I omitted; but however, I &s;oon read enough to convince me of my own Blindne&s;s and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my mind, which did mightily refre&s;h and comfort me in that poor, low, and humble &s;tate in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been &s;o for a con&s;ider|able Time before, very hungry and thir&s;ty after Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readine&s;s of mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thir&s;ty Earth which is parched with Heat and Drought.</P>
<P>This Author laid things down &s;o plainly, and proved them with &s;uch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures &s;o clearly to me, that without &s;tanding to cavil, di&s;|pute, rai&s;e Argument or Objection; or con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood, I pre&s;ently re&s;igned my&s;elf to God, and weeping

for Joy that I had found &s;o great a Trea&s;ure, I often thanked him with Tears in my eyes for &s;o kind a Vi&s;itation of his Love, that he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to look towards me when my Soul cried after him; &s;o, that tho' before I was in great Doubt and Trouble of mind, not knowing which Way to determine my&s;elf, yet now the Sun breaking out &s;o powerfully upon me, the Clouds were &s;cattered: I was now fully &s;atisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of Peo|ple I &s;hould join my&s;elf. So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> and went to <HI>Gracious-&s;treet</HI> Meeting. After I had read <HI>Barclay,</HI> I read &s;ome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a &s;mall Volume, called, <HI>No Cro&s;s, No Crown:</HI> Thus I continued reading and fre|quenting Meetings for &s;everal Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The fir&s;t Man I conver&s;|ed with was <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> and this was &s;everal Weeks after I began to read <HI>Barclay,</HI> and frequent their Meetings; By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and &s;till the farther I went the more I liked their Plainne&s;s, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Conver&s;ation: They do not u&s;e the Ceremo|nies and Salutations of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but &s;hake hands freely and conver&s;e together as Brothers and Si&s;ters that are &s;prung of the &s;ame Royal &s;eed, and made Kings and Prie&s;ts un|to God. O, the Love, the Sweetne&s;s and tenderne&s;s of affecti|on I have &s;een among this people! <HI>By this</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.</HI> John xiii. 35. <HI>Put on therefore,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, (<HI>as the Elect of God holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering,</HI> Col. iii. 12.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear friend, I have given thee an account of my proceedings on this affair. As to my bodily &s;tate, if thou de|&s;ire&s;t to know what it is, I may acquaint thee that I have my health as well as ever, and I ble&s;s God I have food and raiment &s;ufficient for me, &s;o that I want no outward thing; and I have the nece&s;&s;ities and conveniencies of life liberally. Let us not burthen our&s;elves with taking care for the vanities and &s;uper|fluities

of it; let us <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s our ve&s;&s;els in &s;anctification and honour.</HI> 1. <HI>The&s;.</HI> iv. 4. And as we bring our minds into perfect &s;ubjec|tion to the whole will of God, &s;o let us bring our body to the mo&s;t &s;imple and natural way of living, being content with the fewe&s;t Things, never &s;tudying to gratify our wanton Appetites, nor to follow the Cu&s;toms and Humours of men, but how we may &s;o contract our earthly Cares and Plea&s;ures, that we may bring mo&s;t Glory to God, mo&s;t Health and Peace to our own Souls, and do mo&s;t Service to the Truth; and if this be our Aim, certainly a very &s;mall portion of the Things of this World will &s;uffice us: Seeing we are Chri&s;tians, we &s;hould therefore earne&s;tly pur&s;ue tho&s;e Things which bring us neare&s;t to God, and which are mo&s;t perfective of human Nature; for what is more than a Competency &s;eems to be a Burden to a generous philo&s;ophical Soul, which would breathe in a pure Vehicle, that &s;o it may have a quick Sen&s;e and Reli&s;h of all Ble&s;&s;ings, both of the &s;uperior and inferior Worlds.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, my dear Friend, that Religion is a very &s;eri|ous Thing, and Repentance is a great Work, and one preci|ous immortal Soul is of more worth, than ten thou&s;and peri&s;h|ing Worlds, with all their Pomp and Glory: Therefore let us take Courage, and be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, let us not content our&s;elves with a Name and Profe&s;&s;ion of Godli|ne&s;s, let us come to the Life and Power of it; let us not de&s;pond of getting the Victory; we have a little Strength for God; let us be faithful to him and he will give us more Strength, &s;o that we &s;hall &s;ee the Enemy of our Peace fall before us, and no|thing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible unto us: I &s;ay, my Friend, let us be faithful to that Mea&s;ure of Light and Knowledge which God has given us, to be profited and edified by it in a &s;piritual Life, and as God &s;ees we are diligent and faithful to work with the Strength we have, he will more and more enlighten us, &s;o that we &s;hall &s;ee to the End of tho&s;e Forms and Shadows of Religi|on wherein we have formerly lived; but if he &s;ees we are about to take up our Re&s;t in tho&s;e Shadows, that we grow cold and indifferent in the pur&s;uit of Holine&s;s, running out into Notions and Speculations, and have more mind to di&s;pute; and to make

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LATELY received a kind and brotherly Letter from thee, for which I return thee many Thanks. I am now in the Com|munion of the People called <HI>Quakers;</HI> and I have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for this happy Change of my Life: I am thro' Mercy brought off from the Shadow of Religion, and am pre&s;&s;ing for|wards to get Acquaintance with the quickening Power, Life and Virtue of it, if that I may be a Chri&s;tian indeed, and not in Name and Profe&s;&s;ion only. I had a threat while talk'd and di&s;|cours'd of Holine&s;s, but did not under&s;tand what it was to talk with God, to live and dwell in him. Perhaps indeed &s;ome may think I made a fair Shew of Piety when I was with you. But alas! I was deeply &s;en&s;ible of my own Faults and Mi&s;carriages and I re&s;olved thro' God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance to enquire after &s;omething more Noble and Excellent than I had di&s;covered in that State; and ble&s;&s;ed be his Name for ever, that God hath an&s;wered the Cry of my Soul, and let me &s;ee a People that are hated and de|&s;pi&s;ed by the World, but are dear to him; for he hath revealed to them the My&s;teries of the Kingdom; he hath carried them upon Eagles Wings, and cheri&s;hed them as the Apple of his Eye. As for me, I have been yet but in the outward Court; and far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of that Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is taught and prac|ti&s;ed among this People: For they are come within the Holie&s;t of all, they are come into a near Communion with God, to be|hold the Cherubims of Glory that cover the Mercy-Seat, to be fed with the true Manna. The&s;e are My&s;teries that are to be revealed unto the Meek and Lowly, but the Haughty, In&s;olent and Prophane, cannot come near them, nor ta&s;te of the Sweet|ne&s;s nor Comfort of them. Indeed the formal traditional &s;ort of People of the World, may talk of the&s;e Things as they have heard from others, and in their &s;ober minutes may have &s;ome faint Glimmerings that Way; but to come to a real and in|ward Enjoyment of them, they can no more pretend to, than to work the greate&s;t Impo&s;&s;ibilities; all their Wit and Subtility, and Learning cannot reach higher for to handle of the Word of

Life; this is peculiar only to tho&s;e who are content to for&s;ake all, and become Fools for Chri&s;t, they are tho&s;e who are in a good Temper to receive and co-operate with the influence of the Holy Spirit, and have &s;een the Emptine&s;s and Vanity of all tho&s;e Things that are &s;o much admired by the World; the Schools, and Univer&s;ities, and Learned Doctors, and Great Rab|bies, have not profitted me; they are ravened from the Spirit of God, and gone out into their own Notions and Speculations, thinking thereby to &s;earch out God and comprehend the Truth. Alas! the My&s;teries of God's Kingdom are far out of their Reach in their carnal minds; they weary them&s;elves in vain; the Vulture's Eye cannot pierce into the&s;e Secrets; all the great Critick Scholars and Philo&s;ophers of the World are Fools in the&s;e things, and whil&s;t they are wearying them&s;elves to find the deep Things of our God, &s;tudying and racking their Heads, to&s;&s;ing and tumbling to and fro like a wild Bull in a Net, and knows not which Way to di&s;entangle him&s;elf; the more he &s;truggles, the weaker he grows, the fa&s;ter he is bound; &s;o the more the&s;e vain Talkers read the more they write; the more they cavil and di&s;pute, the further they are from God, and the more they declare their Hatred and Enmity to the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and to the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel. I have been a long time aware of the Folly and Impertinency of the&s;e Men, and chiefly the celebrated Fathers of the Church, as they call them; the Councils and Synods of Old, are now of very &s;mall Account with me; I am not a&s;hamed to &s;it under the Teachings of Wo|men and Mechanicks, how&s;oever they may &s;eem in the Eye of the World; for they teach me more Chri&s;tianity, and in&s;truct me more perfectly in a divine Life, than all the &s;tudied elabo|rated Sermons and Di&s;cour&s;es that ever I heard at the Univer|&s;ities, or &s;ince; their Words are with Power, they are mighti|ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the Spirit of God, they &s;peak with Maje&s;ty and Authority, and there is a native Beauty, Clearne&s;s and Solidity of Expre&s;&s;ion that &s;hines thro' their Di&s;cour&s;es, which is &s;uffi|cient to an&s;wer that groundle&s;s Calumny, viz, <HI>The Quakers

Oftentimes hath my Spirit been refre&s;hed with theirs, when we have met together to wait upon God; and my Soul &s;till longs and pants more and more to be filled with the&s;e divine Comforts: he is ready always to pour down Ble&s;&s;ings up|on us, if we could qualify our&s;elves for the Reception of them; If we would put away vain Thoughts, which cloud and darken the Mind, and &s;o hinders the Favourable Influence and Iradati|ons of Heaven.</P>

She knows this is but a &s;top, till &s;he may embark for eternity; and that a &s;mall &s;pace is allowed her to prepare for the voyage. The main part of this &s;pace is ravi&s;hed from her by the nece&s;|&s;ities of nature, and but a &s;lender pittance left to her own di&s;|po&s;al: and yet, this moment that remains, does &s;o &s;trangely op|pre&s;s and perplex her, that &s;he only &s;tudies how to lo&s;e it. She feels an intolerable burden, in being obliged to live with her&s;elf, and think of her&s;elf; and, therefore, her principal care is to forget her&s;elf, and to let this &s;hort and precious moment pa&s;s away without reflection, by being amu&s;ed with things that prevent her notice of its &s;peed. This is the ground of all the tumultuary bu&s;ine&s;s, of all the trifling diver&s;ions among&s;t men; in which our general aim is to make the time pa&s;s off our hands, without feeling it, or rather without feeling our|&s;elves; and, by getting rid of this &s;mall portion of life, to avoid that inward di&s;gu&s;t and bitterne&s;s, which we &s;hould not fail to meet with, if we found lei&s;ure to de&s;cend into our own brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>We imagine that, at lea&s;t, &s;ome re&s;pite, &s;ome &s;helter, may be found, by agreeing to bani&s;h them from our meditation. This is the only natural comfort which mankind have been a|ble to invent under their numerous calamities. But a mo&s;t mi|&s;erable comfort it proves; becau&s;e it does not tend to the re|moval of the&s;e evils, but only to the concealment of them for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on; and becau&s;e, in thus concealing them it hinders us from applying &s;uch proper means as would remove them. Thus, by a &s;trange revolution in the nature of man, that grief and inward di&s;quiet which he dreads as the greate&s;t of &s;en&s;ible e|vils, is, in one re&s;pect, his greate&s;t good; becau&s;e it might contribute, more than all things be&s;ides, to the putting of him in a &s;ucce&s;sful method of recovery. On the other hand, his di|ver&s;ions, which he &s;eems to prize as his &s;overeign good, are, in|deed his greate&s;t evil; becau&s;e they are of all things the mo&s;t effctually in making him negligent under his di&s;temper: they do but amu&s;e and beguile him; and, in the conclu&s;ion, lead him down blindfold into the grave.

Nor is it by fixing man in his own per&s;on, that the&s;e wonderful effects are produced; it is by carrying him to God, and by &s;upporting him under the &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;eries, with the hopes of an a&s;&s;ured and complete deliverance in a better life.</P>

<P>"THE call which men have for diver&s;ion, is not by far &s;o great as is thought, and it con&s;i&s;ts more in imagination or in cu&s;tom, than in real nece&s;&s;ity. Tho&s;e who are employed in bodily labour, have only need of a bare ce&s;&s;ation from it. Tho&s;e who are employed in affairs toil&s;ome to the mind, and but lit|tle laborious to the body, have only need to recollect them&s;elves from that di&s;po&s;ition which tho&s;e &s;ort of employments naturally cau&s;e, and not to di&s;&s;ipate them&s;elves yet more, by diver&s;ions which extremely engage the mind. It is a je&s;t to fancy that one has need to pa&s;s three hours in filling the mind with follies at a play. Tho&s;e who find in them&s;elves this need, ought to look on it, not as a natural weakne&s;s, but as a vice of cu&s;tom, which they mu&s;t cure by &s;erious employment."</P>

<P>"Plays and romances not only indi&s;po&s;e the &s;oul for all acts of religion and piety, but they give it a di&s;gu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to all &s;erious and ordinary actions. As nothing is repre&s;ented

<P>"Tho&s;e deceive them&s;elves extremely, who think that plays make no ill impre&s;&s;ion on them, becau&s;e they do not find them excite any formed evil de&s;ire. There are many degrees before one comes to an entire corruption of mind; and it is always ex|tremely hurtful to the &s;oul, to de&s;troy the ramparts which &s;e|cured it from temptation."</P>
<P>"One does not begin to fall when the fall becomes &s;en&s;ible; the fallings of the &s;oul are &s;low, they have preparations and progre&s;&s;ions; and it often happens, that we are overcome by temptations, only by our having weakened our&s;elves in occa&s;i|ons which &s;eemed of no importance: it being certain, that he who de&s;pi&s;es little things, &s;hall fall by little and little."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t not be imagined that the wicked maxims of which plays are full, are not hurtful, becau&s;e people do not go there to form their &s;entiments, but to divert them&s;elves: for they do not fail of making impre&s;&s;ions, notwith&s;tanding, without being perceived.&mdash;For in&s;tance, the opinion that the chimera of honour is &s;o great a good, that it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved, even at the expence of life, is what produces the brutal rage of the gentle|men of France. If tho&s;e who fight a duel were ever &s;poken of but as fools and madmen&mdash;as indeed they are; if that phantom

of honour, which is their idol, were never repre&s;ented but as a chimera and a folly; if care were taken never to form any image of revenge, but as of a mean and cowardly action; the re&s;ent|ment which men feel upon an affront would be infinitely weak|er; but that which exa&s;perates and renders it the more lively' is the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion, that there is cowardice in bearing an af|front. Now, it cannot be denied that plays, which are full of the&s;e evil maxims, do greatly contribute to fortify that im|pre&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e the mind being by them tran&s;ported, and en|tirely out of it&s;elf in&s;tead of correcting tho&s;e &s;entiments abandons it&s;elf to them without re&s;i&s;tence and delighst to feel the motions they in&s;pire, which di&s;po&s;e it to produce the like upon occa&s;ion."&mdash;"God does not impute to us the coldne&s;s which pro|ceeds from the withdrawing of his light, or merely from the heavine&s;s of this body; but, no doubt, he imputes to us that to which we have contributed by our negligence, and our vain di|ver&s;ions. It is his will that we &s;hould e&s;teem nothing &s;o much as the gracious gift which he has made us of his love; and that we &s;hould be careful to pre&s;erve it by giving it nouri&s;hment. This command he has intimated to us in the per&s;ons of the prie&s;ts in the ancient law, whom he ordains always to maintain the fire on the altar, and to take care to put wood upon it eve|ry day in the morning. This altar is the heart of man, and e|very Chri&s;tian is the prie&s;t; who ought to be careful to nouri&s;h the fire of charity on the altar of his heart, by putting wood e|very day upon it; that is to &s;ay, maintaining it by the medita|tion of divine things, and by exerci&s;es of piety. Now, if tho&s;e who go to plays have yet any &s;en&s;e of piety, they cannot di&s;own that plays deaden, and tend to entirely extingui&s;h devotion; &s;o that they &s;hould not doubt, God judges them extremely guil|ty, for having made &s;o little account of his love, that in&s;tead of nouri&s;hing and endeavouring to augment it, they have not feared to extingui&s;h it by their vain diver&s;ions; and that he will impute to them as a great &s;in, the abatement or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;s of their love to him.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be evident to every &s;ober and unprejudiced mind, that the &s;entiments of the&s;e enlightened men, on the corrupting influence, and the fatal amu&s;ements, of the theatre, merit the mo&s;t &s;erious and attentive con&s;ideration: and to &s;ome minds, it is apprehended, they will appear to be &s;olid and awakening reflections.</P>
<P>If it be true, that many profane, indecent, and irreligious &s;entiments are to be found in the works of dramatic writers, and the&s;e &s;entiments coloured with the &s;ofte&s;t names, and re|commended on the &s;tage by the mo&s;t captivating characters and actions;&mdash;if the &s;en&s;es and imagination are &s;o charmed with the

<P>What advantages can they yeild us, that will compen&s;ate the lo&s;s or hazard of intere&s;ts &s;o important. All the plea&s;ures, and all the refinements which their warme&s;t votaries have ever found in them, are indeed a poor recompence for the corrupti|on, extravagance, and mi&s;ery which they have too frequently &s;own the &s;eeds of, and produced in human life.</P>
<P>It becomes us then, as rational beings, as Chri&s;tians, who are called to renounce the vanities of this tran&s;ient precarious &s;tate, and who have a permanent and better world in view, to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of our nature, and to act conformably to the impor|tance of our de&s;tination. A few fleeting years will bring us all to the verge of an awful &s;cene, when the vain diver&s;ions and pa&s;times, which are now &s;o highly prized, will appear in their true light, a mo&s;t lamentable abu&s;e of that precious time and ta|lent with which we have been entru&s;ted, for the great purpo&s;e of working out our &s;oul's &s;alvation. At that &s;olemn period, tho great bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, a pious and virtuous life; dedicated to the love and &s;ervice of God, will appear of ine&s;timable value, and, in the highe&s;t degree, worthy of the concern and pur&s;uit of rea&s;onable beings. Happy will it be for us, if we become wi&s;e in time, take up the cro&s;s to all en&s;naring plea&s;ures, for the few remaining days of our lives, and &s;teadily per&s;evere, under the Divine Aid, in fulfiling the various duties a&s;&s;igned us, &amp; in making &s;uitable returns to the Author of all good, for the unmerited ble&s;&s;ings which he hath bountifully be&s;towed up|on

us. In the&s;e exalted employments we &s;hall experience the noble&s;t plea&s;ure, and feel no want of empty and injurious en|tertainments, to occupy our minds, or to fill up our time. In the &s;cens and productions of nature, and in the u&s;eful works of art; in the faithful narratives of human life, and the de&s;crip|tion of intere&s;ting objects; in the endearments of &s;ocial and do|me&s;tic intercour&s;e; in acts of charity and benevolence; and in the plea&s;ing reflections of an upright and &s;elf-approving mind, we &s;hall perceive al&s;o abundant &s;ources of innocent refre&s;hment and true cheerfulne&s;s, as well as the means of enlarging our under&s;tandings and improving our hearts.</P>
<P>May tho&s;e per&s;ons, therefore, who have doubts re&s;pecting propriety of indulging them&s;elves in theatrical amu&s;ements, and, indeed, may all who read the&s;e lines, &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the hazard of &s;uch indulgences and give the &s;ubject that attention which its importance demand. May tho&s;e e&s;pecially, who are convinced of their dangerous nature and tendency; reject with abhorrence the &s;olicitations of appetite and plea&s;ure, and the fallacious rea&s;onings which are often adduced in their &s;upport. May we never be impo&s;ed on by the common, but de|lu&s;ive &s;entiments, that moral and religious improvement is to be acquired from &s;uch impure mixtures; and that the literary merit, and accurate knowledge of the human heart, which are di&s;played in many parts of dramatic works, will alone for the fatal wounds which innocence, delicacy, and religion, too fre|quently &s;uffer from the&s;e performances. But being convinced that depraved nature will ever &s;elect what is mo&s;t congenial to it&s;elf; and that the plea&s;ures derived from refined compo&s;iti|on, and the exhibitions of ta&s;te and elegance, may be purcha|&s;ed at too dear a rate, let us re&s;olutely and uniformly oppo&s;e what we believe to be evil, however it may be arrayed; and do our utmo&s;t to di&s;courage by our example and influence, tho&s;e powerful and de&s;tructive engines of di&s;&s;ipation, profanene&s;s and, corruption.</P>

<HEAD>THE following sentiments, so expressive of the nature and power of true religion, and its influence upon his own mind was solemnly expressed by <HI>GILBERT BUR|NET,</HI> near the conclusion of his days.</HEAD>
<P>"I WILL conclude with that which is the mo&s;t important of all things, and which alone will carry every thing el&s;e along with it; which is; to recommend, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;eri|ous
<PB N="115" REF="035518_0114_10055C2537DC2BC0">
manner, the &s;tudy and practice of religion to all &s;orts of men, as that which is both the light of the world, and &s;alt of the earth.</P>
<P>"Nothing does &s;o open our faculties, and compo&s;e and direct the whole man, as an inward &s;en&s;e of God; of his authority o|ver us; the laws he hath &s;et us; of his eye over us; of his hearing our prayers; a&s;&s;i&s;ting our endeavours; watching over our concerns; of his being to judge, &amp; reward or puni&s;h us in a|nother &s;tate, according to what we do in this. Nothing will give a man &s;uch a dete&s;tation of &s;in, and &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the good|ne&s;s of God, and of our obligations to holine&s;s, as a right un|der&s;tanding and firm belief of the Chri&s;tian religion. Nothing can give a man &s;o calm a peace within, and &s;uch a firm &s;ecuri|ty again&s;t all fears and dangers without, as the belief of a kind, wi&s;e providence, and of a future &s;tate."</P>
<P>"Integrity of heart gives a man courage and confidence that cannot be &s;haken. A man is &s;ure, that by living according to the rules of religion, he becomes the wi&s;e&s;t, the be&s;t &amp; the happi|e&s;t creature that he is capable of being. Hone&s;t indu&s;try, the employing of time well, a con&s;tant &s;obriety, an undefiled purity and cha&s;tity, with a quiet &s;erenity, are the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives too of life and health: &s;o that take a man as an individual, re|ligion is his guard, his perfection, his beauty, and his glory. This will make him a light in the world, &s;hining brightly, and enlightening many round about him."</P>
<P>"Thus, religion, if truly received and &s;incerely adhered to, would prove the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings to a nation. But, by religion; I under&s;tand &s;omething more than the receiving of &s;ome doctrines, though ever &s;o true, or the profe&s;&s;ing of them, and engaging to &s;upport them, not without zeal and eagerne&s;s. What &s;ignify the be&s;t doctrines, if men do not live &s;uitably to them; if they have not a due influence upon their thoughts and their lives? Men of bad lives, with found opinions, are &s;elf con|demned and lie under a highly aggravated guilt."</P>
<P>"By religion, I do not mean an outward compliance with forms and cu&s;toms, in going to Church, to prayers, to &s;ermons, and to &s;acraments, with an external &s;hew of devotion; or, which is more, with &s;ome inward forced good thoughts, in which many &s;atisfy them&s;elves, while they have no vi&s;ible ef|fect on their lives, nor any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ward force to &s;ubdue' and rectify their appetites, pa&s;&s;ions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecret de&s;igns. Tho&s;e cu&s;tomary performances, how good and u&s;eful &s;oever, when under&s;tood, and rightly directed, are of little value when they re&s;t on them, and think becau&s;e they do them, they have acquitted them&s;elves of their duty, though they continue &s;till proud, covetous, full of deceit, envy and malice. Even &s;ecret prayers, the mo&s;t ef|fectual
<PB N="116" REF="035518_0115_10055616990F4498" MS="y">
means, are de&s;igned for a higher end; which is, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s our minds with &s;uch a con&s;tant and pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of divine truths, as may make he &s;et live in us, and draw down &s;uch a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, as to exalt and &s;anctify our natures."</P>
<P>"So that, by religion, I mean &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of divine truth as enters into a man, and becomes the &s;pring of a new nature within him; reforming his thoughts and de&s;igns, purifying his heart; &s;anctifying and governing his whole deportment, his words as well as his actions; convincing him that it is not e|nough not to be &s;candalou&s;ly vicious, or to be innocent in his conver&s;ation, but that he mu&s;t be entirely, uniformly, and con|&s;tantly pure and virtuous, animated with zeal to be &s;till better and better, more eminently good and exemplary."</P>
<P>"This is true religion, which is the perfection of human na|ture, and the joy and delight of every one that feels it active and &s;trong within him. It is true this is not arrived at, all at once, and it will have an unhappy alloy, hanging long even about a good man; but, as tho&s;e ill mixtures are the perpetual grief of his &s;oul, &s;o that it is his chief care to watch over, and mortify them, he will be in a continual progre&s;s, &s;till gaining ground upon him&s;elf: and as he attains to a degree of purity, he will find a flame of life and joy growing up in him. Of this I write with a greater concern and emotion, becau&s;e I have felt this the true, and indeed, the only joy which runs through a man's heart and life. It is that which hath been, for many years my greate&s;t &s;upport. I rejoice daily in it, I feel from it the earne&s;t of that &s;upreme joy which I want &amp; long for; and I am &s;ure there is nothing el&s;e which can afford any true and com|plete happine&s;s."</P>
