<P><HI>A.</HI> MY friend, the la&s;t que&s;tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colorum diver&s;itas, diver&s;as inter gentes ex climatum differentia praecipue oritur.</NOTE> has &s;ugge&s;ted another; which, as it is acknowledged by all to be far from unimpor|tant, and, in the apprehen&s;ions of many, by no means improper to be attentively con&s;ider|ed by this people at the pre&s;ent day; the can|dor of this truly venerable, this learned and polite a&s;&s;embly will excu&s;e us in attempting, in a few words, to examine, <HI>Whether the &s;lave|ry, to which Africans are in this province, by the permi&s;&s;ion of law, &s;ubjected, be agreable to
<PB N="4" REF="012917_0003_0F8E6E36D9A984E0">the law of nature?</HI> And &s;ince, fully per&s;ua|ded of the truth of tho&s;e principles, in which is founded the idea of natural equality, to the exclu&s;ion of a right in one individual of the human &s;pecies to exerci&s;e any degree of autho|rity over another without his con&s;ent, I am o|bliged to appear in favor of the negative of the propo&s;ition; and &s;ince, if I rightly remem|ber, I have &s;ometimes heard you expre&s;s a very different &s;entiment, if you are di&s;po&s;ed to join in the propo&s;al, I will fir&s;t attend to what may be offered on your part in &s;upport of it. And &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that the &s;trange|ly incon&s;i&s;tent conduct of mankind, re&s;pecting this matter, furni&s;hes us with reflections upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature by no means the mo&s;t agreable. To me, I confe&s;s, it is matter of painful a&s;toni&s;hment, that in this enlightened age and land, where the princi|ples of natural and civil Liberty, and con&s;e|quently the natural rights of mankind are &s;o generally under&s;tood, the ca&s;e of the&s;e unhappy <HI>Africans</HI> &s;hould gain no more attention;&mdash; that tho&s;e, who are &s;o readily di&s;po&s;ed to urge the principles of natural equality in defence of their own Liberties, &s;hould, with &s;o little reluctance, continue to exert a power, by the
<PB N="5" REF="012917_0004_0F8E6E37A9C705C8">operation of which they are &s;o flagrantly con|tradicted. For what le&s;s can be &s;aid of that exerci&s;e of power, whereby &s;uch multitudes of our fellow-men, de&s;cendants, my friend from the &s;ame common parent with you and me, and between whom and us nature has made no di&s;tinction, &s;ave what ari&s;es from the &s;tronger influence of the &s;un in the climate whence they originated, are held to groan un|der the in&s;upportable burden of the mo&s;t ab|ject &s;lavery, without one chearing beam to re|fre&s;h their de&s;ponding &s;ouls; and upon who&s;e dreary path not even the feeble&s;t ray of hope is permitted to dawn, and who&s;e only pro&s;pect of deliverance is&mdash;in death. If indeed the law protects their lives, (which is all that can be &s;aid even here, and more&mdash;&s;hame to man|kind! &mdash;more than can be &s;aid in &s;ome of our &s;i&s;ter colonies <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">According to an act of Virginia (4 Anne, Ch. 49. &s;ect. 37. p. 227.) <Q>After proclamation is i&s;&s;ued again&s;t &s;laves that run away and lie out, it is <HI>law|ful</HI> for any per&s;on whatever, <HI>to kill and de&s;troy &s;uch &s;laves</HI> by &s;uch ways and means as he, &s;he, or they &s;hall think fit, <HI>without accu&s;ation or impeachment of any crime for the &s;ame,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

<P><HI>B.</HI> Though con&s;cious, my friend, of my inability, the mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly to repre&s;ent the arguments in favor of this propo&s;ition, e&s;|pecially when circum&s;cribed within the nar|row limits the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will allow; yet clearly convinced of the propriety of attentive|ly con&s;idering this que&s;tion, e&s;pecially at a pe|riod when per&s;ons of every denomination are &s;o ju&s;tly affected with a &s;en&s;e of Liberty, I readily comply; rather hoping that if any pre&s;ent, are in doubt re&s;pecting this matter, they will take occa&s;ion from hence, &s;o fully to examine it, as to procure &s;atisfaction to them|&s;elves, than expecting what &s;hall be now of|fered on my part will have &s;o de&s;irable an ef|fect.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012917_0006_0F8E6E3B70B859E0">
I am well aware of the difficulty of his ta&s;k who attempts to defend a propo&s;ition of this nature. An heart replete with benevolence and compa&s;&s;ion will hardly admit rea&s;oning that involves principles &s;eemingly incompati|ble with the happine&s;s of <HI>any.</HI> Suffer me therefore to entreat you, that every tender &s;en|timent, that even the feelings of humanity may be &s;u&s;pended, while we calmly attend to the voice of rea&s;on, which is the voice of na|ture's alwi&s;e and benevolent Author.</P>
<P>That Liberty to all is &s;weet I freely own; but &s;till 'tis what, in a &s;tate of &s;ociety at lea&s;t, all cannot equally enjoy, and what even in a <HI>free</HI> government can be enjoyed in the mo&s;t perfect &s;en&s;e by none. Such is the nature of &s;ociety, that it requires various degrees of au|thority and &s;ubordination; and while the uni|ver&s;al rule of right, <HI>the happine&s;s of the whole,</HI> allows greater degrees of Liberty to &s;ome, the &s;ame immutable law &s;uffers it to be enjoyed only in le&s;s degrees by others. And though my friend, I can mo&s;t cordially join with you in the benevolent wi&s;h, that it were po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e Africans, who I am free with you to call my brethren, and to whom, it is confe&s;&s;ed, the
<PB N="8" REF="012917_0007_0F8E6E3C58FAB2F8">principles of our civil con&s;titution allow but a &s;mall degree of liberty, might enjoy it equal|ly with us; yet 'till I am convinced it might comport with the rule above mentioned, to al|low them more I am in duty bound to appear an advocate for tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be remembered, that the que&s;tion to be con&s;idered is, <HI>"Whether the &s;lavery, to which Africans are in this Pro|vince, by the permi&s;&s;ion of law, &s;ubjected, be agre|able to the law of nature?"</HI></P>
<P>It is, I pre&s;ume, &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve to you, that by the law of nature is intended that law which is the mea&s;ure of all our moral actions, and by which their fitne&s;s and proprie|ty, and con&s;equently their ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, are to be determined. In other words, that law to which whatever action is in it's nature fit and proper, ju&s;t and right, is agreable, and to which every action of an oppo&s;ite nature is di&s;agreable. This, then being intended by the law of nature, whether the ju&s;tice of <HI>Af|rican &s;lavery,</HI> if found agreable to this law, is defen&s;ible, will be needle&s;s to inquire. But it will be &s;aid, through this definition of the
<PB N="9" REF="012917_0008_0F8E6E3CDA8064B0">law of nature be admitted, we are &s;till to be informed what tho&s;e actions are, that are agre|able to this law, and con&s;equently right. I an&s;wer, whatever action in it's nature, con|comitant circum&s;tances being con&s;idered; tends to <HI>happine&s;s on the whole,</HI> is agreable to this law, and every action of a contrary tendency is hereunto di&s;agreable. And hence it will follow, that whatever practical princi|ple of &s;ociety, (which is to be con&s;idered as the action of the community) hath this ten|dency, is to be reputed ju&s;t, and approved and adopted, and tho&s;e of a contrary tendency con&s;equently di&s;approved.</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary only to ob&s;erve, that as nothing in nature can po&s;&s;ibly be of the lea&s;t con&s;equence but hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery, &s;o the difference in the ten|dency of the practical principles of any &s;ocie|ty to the production of the&s;e, is the only thing that can po&s;&s;ibly render &s;ome eligible, fit and proper, rather than others; and was it not for this di&s;tinction, it mu&s;t forever remain a mat|ter of perfect indifference, what practical prin|ciples were in any &s;ociety adopted. But with|out
<PB N="10" REF="012917_0009_0F8E6E3D99103AB0">&s;topping more fully to demon&s;trate the truth of this principle, it having been recog|ni&s;ed as well by the generality of ethic writers, as by the wi&s;dom of all good governments, I &s;hall proceed to enquire, how far it will ope|rate to the determination of the pre&s;ent que&s;ti|on.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall enquire into the agreement of the law of nature with the idea of &s;lavery <HI>in general,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to that principle of natural equality, which is &s;o zeal|ou&s;ly contended for by the advocates for u|niver&s;al Liberty.</P>
<P>By &s;lavery <HI>in general</HI> I mean the involunta|ry &s;ubordination of the will of one to that of another; whereby, independent of all com|pact, the actions of the former are in all things to be directed by the will of the latter. Now if &s;lavery <HI>in general,</HI> according to this defini|tion, be agreable to the law of nature, the principle of natural equality mu&s;t fall, and in order to determine the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, it will be nece&s;&s;ary only to apply the general principle to the ca&s;e of the <HI>African</HI> &s;ubordina|tion, whereby it will be ca&s;y to di&s;cern if there
<PB N="11" REF="012917_0010_0F8E6E3E6FDFF370">is any thing in the nature of their particular ca&s;e not agreable hereto.</P>
<P>I am therefore now to &s;hew, that &s;lavery, as above defined, is not repugnant to the law of nature, and therefore that the principle of natural equality cannot be true.</P>
<P>That right of authority is to be found in &s;ome being involving &s;ubordination in others, independent of all voluntary contract on the part of the &s;ubordinate, is, as far as I know, univer&s;ally acknowledged. Such is the right of the Governor of the univer&s;e to govern and direct the conduct of all finite exi&s;tences, and &s;uch is the right of parents to govern and di|rect the conduct of their children. Now if it be found, that there is the &s;ame foundation for authority and &s;ubordination among dif|ferent individuals of the human &s;pecies, be|tween whom no &s;uch relations as tho&s;e above-mentioned do &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as there is for authority and &s;ubordination in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it is ac|knowledged to be ju&s;t, it will follow, that de|grees of rightful authority in &s;ome, involving degrees of &s;ubordination in others, mu&s;t be admitted among them likewi&s;e. In other
<PB N="12" REF="012917_0011_0F8E6E41A677D6E0">words, if the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>foundation</HI> of the <HI>ab&s;o|lute</HI> authority of the Governor of the univer&s;e over the creation, and the <HI>limited</HI> authority of parents over their children, be found to o|perate with equal &s;trength in favor of a right of &s;ome individuals among mankind to exer|ci&s;e any degrees of authority over others, the exerci&s;e of &s;uch authority mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed ju&s;t, i. e. agreable to the law of nature. And now to determine this que&s;tion, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to inquire, in what the right of autho|rity, in the ca&s;es abovementioned, is founded: And here the an&s;wer is obvious, in <HI>the greate&s;t good of the whole.</HI> For &s;ince the Governor of the univer&s;e is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s in perfection of degree, it is im|po&s;&s;ible but that the greate&s;t happine&s;s to the creation &s;hould be the re&s;ult of his exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;overeignty. And though this right of ab&s;olute authority in the Creator over his creatures be in&s;eparable from the rela|tion between Creator and creature, yet it is not founded &s;imply in that relation, that is, in the idea of derived exi&s;tence; but in the natural imperfection and dependance of the creature, and the natural perfection of the Creator, and the rea&s;on of the nece&s;&s;arily ab&s;olute &s;ubjecti|on of the creature does not con&s;i&s;t merely in
<PB N="13" REF="012917_0012_0F8E6E4291A45F68">his having <HI>received exi&s;tence,</HI> but in his having received it from <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Being; a Being by the perfection of his nature qualified for the mo&s;t perfect government, and under who&s;e admini&s;|tration it is impo&s;&s;ible but that the before-mentioned immutable law of nature, the great|e&s;t happine&s;s of the whole, &s;hould operate to effect. Agreable to this is the foundation of the natural authority of parents over their chil|dren; it by no means con&s;i&s;ting in the notion of <HI>derived exi&s;tence;</HI> but in the different quali|fications of parents and children to execute this immutable law: For while parents &s;o far excel their children in wi&s;dom, and from na|tural affection are di&s;po&s;ed to promote their happine&s;s, it will follow, that more happine&s;s will re&s;ult to both, from the exerci&s;e of au|thority in parents, and &s;ubordination in chil|dren, than from the exerci&s;e of equal Liberty in each. And that this authority of parents over their children is derived from this &s;ource, and not from the natural relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, con&s;idered merely as parents and offspring, is moreover evident beyond all contradiction from this con&s;ideration, that whenever the parent is by any means di&s;qua|lified, in the re&s;pects before mentioned, to di|rect the conduct of his child, the &s;ubordinati|on of the child cea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012917_0013_0F8E6E42DDCEFB40">
If this, which I think none will deny, be a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the foundation in <HI>na|ture</HI> of authority and &s;ubordination; in order to ju&s;tify involuntary &s;lavery <HI>in general,</HI> in op|po&s;ition to the notion of <HI>natural</HI> equality, it is nece&s;&s;ary only to inquire, whether among dif|ferent individuals, between whom there is no &s;uch natural relation as that of parent and off|&s;pring, there be not the &s;ame rea&s;on, ground, and foundation in nature for the exerci&s;e of authority in &s;ome, nece&s;&s;arily involving &s;u|bordination in others, which there is in ca&s;es where &s;uch relation actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. And concerning this, no one &s;urely can remain a moment undetermined, who reflects with the lea&s;t degree of attention, upon the va&s;t ine|quality ob&s;ervable between different individuals of the human &s;pecies, in point of qualification for the proper direction of conduct. Now whether this inequality be con&s;idered as ari&s;ing from difference in natural capacity, difference in the means of improvement, or in di&s;po&s;iti|on properly to employ &s;uch means; in a word, whether it ari&s;es from nature or education, or any other &s;uppo&s;eable quarter, it matters not, while this is in fact the ca&s;e, while &s;ome are actually found &s;o far to excel others both in re&s;pect of wi&s;dom and benevolence, both in
<PB N="15" REF="012917_0014_0F8E6E439EB8C2E8">the knowledge of the principles of propriety, and a di&s;po&s;ition to practice &s;uch principles, that the general end, happine&s;s, would be bet|ter promoted by the exerci&s;e of authority in the former, though nece&s;&s;arily involving &s;u|bordination in the latter, than by the enjoy|ment of equal Liberty in each, the exerci&s;e of &s;uch authority mu&s;t be right, and never the le&s;s &s;o, though the individuals by &s;uch an oeconomy &s;ubordinated, do not con&s;ent. It is fit that children &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the au|thority of their parents, whether they con&s;ent to &s;uch &s;ubjection or not; this is put beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt by the expre&s;s declara|tion of wi&s;dom which cannot err; not to men|tion the con&s;ent of all ages in their approbati|on of the principles of tho&s;e civil &s;ocieties which have warranted the exerci&s;e of &s;uch au|thority. Every law is applicable to all ca&s;es within the &s;ame rea&s;on; and &s;ince it cannot be denied that the rea&s;on of authority and &s;ubor|dination between parents and children, equal|ly applies to the &s;upport of a di&s;tinction of the &s;ame kind among others not &s;o related, it fol|lows inevitably, that a di&s;tinction in the latter ca&s;e is equally ju&s;tifiable with one in the for|mer; they are both &s;upported by the &s;ame prin|ciple of natural law, and therefore mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012917_0015_0F8E6E44580CEBE0">
I have introduced the&s;e ob&s;ervations upon the foundation of the authority of the Gover|nor of the univer&s;e over the creation, and of parents over their children, for the &s;ake of ex|ample, rather than as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the general idea of inequality: I &s;ay as nece&s;&s;ary, for while there is &s;o manife&s;tly great an ine|quality in the capacities and di&s;po&s;itions of mankind to direct their own as well as the conduct of others, to its only proper end, I think it demon&s;trable, that the principle of ab|&s;olute equality could not be &s;upported, even though we had no argument from fact by which it might be illu&s;trated. And in truth, I think, before the principle of ab&s;olute equa|lity can be maintained, it mu&s;t be made to ap|pear, that all mankind, in point of capacity and di&s;po&s;ition to conduct properly, are equal.</P>
<P>It now remains only to apply the&s;e general principles to the particular ca&s;e of <HI>Africans</HI> in this country, and &s;ee what degree of authority the people here are thereby warranted to ex|erci&s;e over them; and if it &s;hall appear in fact, that they are not reduced by the law of this land to a degree of &s;ubordination beyond what the law of nature abovementioned, the
<PB N="17" REF="012917_0016_0F8E6E451B8AD7A0">happine&s;s of both, requires, it will follow un|deniably, that the law by which they are thus &s;ubjected is ju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Before you proceed to the application you mention, permit me to make an ob&s;erva|tion, that perhaps may render &s;uch applicati|on unnece&s;&s;ary. I think you have by no means &s;upported the idea of &s;lavery <HI>in general;</HI> but that your argument in favour of natural inequality, though ingeniou&s;ly enough con|ducted, is manife&s;tly inconclu&s;ive, and that the contrary, notwith&s;tanding all you have alledg|ed, may &s;till be true. For though I acknow|ledge, that in every &s;ociety the practical prin|ciple that in it's operation tends to the great|e&s;t happine&s;s of the whole is right, i. e. agre|able to the law of nature, and that the <HI>ab&s;o|lute</HI> authority of the Governor of the univer&s;e, and the <HI>limited</HI> authority of parents over their children is founded in the rea&s;on you alledge; and al&s;o admit, among different individuals, all tho&s;e different degrees of qualification for the proper direction of conduct for which you contend; yet that the natural right of inde|pendence is hence excluded, and the princi|ple of natural equality con&s;equently over|thrown
<PB N="18" REF="012917_0017_0F8E6E4629C3F888">is by no means acknowledged. The rea&s;on is obvious, that the principle for which you contend is in the nature of things utter|ly impracticable; your conclu&s;ion therefore, from premi&s;es implying a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is, cannot be admitted.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of authority, only in ca&s;es where &s;uch exerci&s;e is productive of happine&s;s, is undoubtedly right: But &s;uch is the con&s;ti|tution of things with regard to man, &s;uch his nature, &s;tate, and condition, as renders it ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that a principle, warranting the exerci&s;e of authority in any particular ca&s;e, independent of the con&s;ent of the &s;ubordinate, &s;hould be corre&s;pondent to this end. And for this good rea&s;on, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for human wi&s;dom to di&s;tingui&s;h the ca&s;es where the ex|erci&s;e of &s;uch authority would be proper, from tho&s;e where it would not be &s;o; and could this be effected, it would &s;till be utterly impo&s;&s;ible for any <HI>practical principle</HI> of &s;ociety, for any human <HI>law</HI> to make the di&s;tinction. The &s;ame law which would warrant the exerci&s;e of authority in one ca&s;e, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity war|rant it in another; unle&s;s it could be &s;uppo|&s;ed, that &s;ome infallible judge could be pre|&s;ent
<PB N="19" REF="012917_0018_0F8E6E4A595EE750">at all times, and in all places, and direct the operation of law in every particular ca&s;e. And were even this po&s;&s;ible, it might &s;till be doubted whether the principle of natural equa|lity would be overthrown. Such are the weak|ne&s;&s;es and imperfections, the pa&s;&s;ions and pre|judices of the be&s;t of men, and &s;o deeply are all impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of Liberty and in|dependence, that it may well be que&s;tioned, whether a law, warranting authority in tho&s;e ca&s;es only where it would be mo&s;t proper, were &s;uch law po&s;&s;ible, would operate more to the general happine&s;s, than a law e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the principle of natural equality: For tho' in that ca&s;e, many would conduct le&s;s fooli&s;h|ly than they now do; yet the idea of &s;ervi|tude, and dependence upon the will of ano|ther, would be a perpetual, and not unfruit|ful &s;ource of mi&s;ery. But whatever might be the effect of &s;uch a con&s;titution, &s;ince that is confe&s;&s;edly impo&s;&s;ible, it is evident beyond all contradiction, that the principle of natural e|quality is infinitely better adapted to the gene|ral end, happine&s;s, than any other practical principle that can po&s;&s;ibly be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Hence I think it is manife&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the plau&s;ible appearance of your rea&s;oning in theory, &s;ince it will not endure the true touch|&s;tone
<PB N="20" REF="012917_0019_0F8E6E4B4AC97598">of practice, that &s;lavery, which many to their co&s;t know to be a practical thing, is far from being &s;upported thereby.</P>
<P>Your notion of the ground and foundation of natural authority, in the examples you have adduced, is undoubtedly ju&s;t, and con&s;ent in tho&s;e ca&s;es, is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubor|dination, but, unfortunately for your conclu|&s;ion, the ca&s;es are far from being applicable to the point in hand: For as in one ca&s;e, per|fection of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s excludes the po&s;&s;ibility of error, and renders the mo&s;t per|fect &s;ubjection nece&s;&s;arily be&s;t; &s;o the princi|ple of affection implanted by the Author of nature in the brea&s;t of the parent, in&s;piring &s;uch a tender concern for the welfare of his off|&s;pring, and &s;o &s;trongly operative to the pro|duction of kind offices towards him, together with the natural inability of the child, through weakne&s;s or inexperience, to be his own di|rector, may well warrant a general rule of li|mited &s;ubordination in the other. And when you have &s;hewn me the man, or number of men, capable of infallibly directing the con|duct of others, the exerci&s;e of authority in them, &s;hall not want my approbation. And
<PB N="21" REF="012917_0020_0F8E6E4BD7E468C8">when you &s;hall point out to me any cla&s;&s;es of men, between whom there is &s;uch a compara|tive difference in point of ability for the pro|per direction of conduct, as between parents and children, and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;uperior towards the inferior, that the Author of nature has implanted in the hearts of pa|rents towards their children, I will readily ac|knowledge the exerci&s;e of a like degree of au|thority ju&s;tifiable by the law of nature.</P>
<P>But I am much at a lo&s;s to conceive how your rea&s;oning in favor of &s;lavery <HI>in general,</HI> were it ever &s;o fully conclu&s;ive, could po&s;&s;ibly ju&s;tify us in thus forcibly &s;ubjugating the <HI>Af|ricans,</HI> between whom and us nature &s;eems to have made no &s;uch difference as that, upon which you &s;uppo&s;e the notion of <HI>natural ine|quality</HI> to be founded: For I &s;uppo&s;e you will hardly imagine the darkne&s;s of a man's &s;kin incapacitates him for the direction of his con|duct, and authori&s;es his neighbours, who may have the good fortune of a complexion a &s;hade or two lighter, to exerci&s;e authority o|ver him. And if the important difference does not lay here, it &s;eems not very ea&s;y to determine where it does; unle&s;s perchance, it be in the quality of their hair; and if the
<PB N="22" REF="012917_0021_0F8E6E4C991E4088">principle of &s;ubordination lies here, I would advi&s;e every per&s;on, who&s;e hair is inclined to deviate from a right line, to be upon his guard. If indeed any &s;hould alledge, that they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the flatne&s;s of their no&s;es, I can't but think this circum&s;tance a|gain&s;t them, for if a man is to be led and go|verned by the no&s;e, it may well be que&s;tion|ed, whether a no&s;e of a different figure would not be better adapted to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> My friend, I am no enemy to hu|mour, but I think it rarely &s;erves to illu&s;trate a logical conclu&s;ion. I confe&s;s my argument, as you have repre&s;ented it, appears ridiculous enough; but if you had deferred your reply till I had made an application of the principle to the point in hand, perhaps it had &s;aved you this needle&s;s expence of wit. I have not pre|tended, as a con&s;equence from my principles, that every degree of &s;uperiority in point of di&s;|cretion would warrant to any individual of a community a right to exerci&s;e authority over his neighbour: I have only contended, that the notion of <HI>equality,</HI> in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e, had no foundation <HI>in nature;</HI> but as happine&s;s is the only end of action, &s;o &s;uperiority in wi&s;dom,
<PB N="23" REF="012917_0022_0F8E6E4D5F84F458">goodne&s;s, &amp;c. is in the nature of things a proper foundation of authority. And as na|ture has made differences among creatures in the&s;e re&s;pects; &s;o it is fit and proper, and a|greable to nature's law, that different degrees of authority in point of direction of conduct &s;hould be exerci&s;ed by them; and that in &s;ome ca&s;es, even among the human &s;pecies, this difference is &s;o important, as to render the exerci&s;e of authority ju&s;tifiable, even without the con&s;ent of the governed: For this I have produced an example from fact, in the ca&s;e of parents and children. All this you have im|plicitly allowed. I now go on to &s;ay, as a con&s;equence from the &s;ame acknowledged principle, that whenever &s;uch a connection of things takes place, that any number of men cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with the good of the whole, have a re&s;idence in any community but in a &s;tate of involuntary &s;ubordination, and that their re&s;idence in &s;uch community notwith&s;tanding &s;uch &s;ubordination, be in fact be&s;t for the whole, &s;uch &s;ubordination, though involuntary, is no violation of the law of nature; but on the contrary to all in|tents and purpo&s;es corre&s;pondent thereto. This is a true conclu&s;ion from premi&s;es incon|te&s;tible,
<PB N="24" REF="012917_0023_0F8E6E4EC0C72860">principles univer&s;ally acknowledged, and which you your&s;elf have but now admit|ted. Subordination in this ca&s;e comes fully within the rea&s;on of the &s;ubordination of chil|dren, re&s;ts on preci&s;ely the &s;ame foundation, and is therefore ju&s;tifiable on preci&s;ely the &s;ame principles. For whether the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch &s;ubordination ari&s;es from natural inca|pacity, or from any other quarter, it matters not, if this is in fact the ca&s;e; if the intere&s;t of the whole does require it; let the cau&s;es or rea&s;ons of &s;uch requirement be what they may, &s;uch &s;ubordination is equally ju&s;tifiable as in any other ca&s;e whatever; not only in the ca&s;e of children, but even in the ca&s;e of con&s;ent; for the obligation to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from con&s;ent, is founded in the general obligation to fulfil contracts; which obligation is ulti|mately founded in the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Now fully within this predicament lies, as I conceive, the particular ca&s;e of <HI>Africans</HI> in this country. That it is only in a &s;tate of limited &s;ubordination (I &s;ay <HI>limited,</HI> for it is to be remembered, that the authority of tho&s;e to whom they are &s;ubordinate, is re&s;tricted by the &s;uperior authority of law, to which we are all &s;ubordinate, and which provides that
<PB N="25" REF="012917_0024_0F8E6E4F1445AE98">they, as well as others, &s;hall be treated accord|ing to the general principles of humanity) that the&s;e people can <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> enjoy a re&s;i|dence among us is, I &s;uppo&s;e, acknowledged by all. And whether it is not better for them to re&s;ide here, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch &s;ubordi|nation, even regard being had to <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t only, than in their native country, no one can doubt, at lea&s;t no one, who has a tolerably adequate conception of their mi&s;ery, and wretchedne&s;s there. Figure to your&s;elf my friend, you are not unacquainted with <HI>Afri|can</HI> hi&s;tory, figure to your&s;elf the delightful &s;ituation of a natural inhabitant of <HI>Africa.</HI> View him nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of every mean of improvement in &s;ocial virtue, of every ad|vantage for the cultivation of tho&s;e principles of humanity, in which alone con&s;i&s;ts the dig|nity of the rational nature, and from which only &s;ource &s;prings all that plea&s;ure, that hap|pine&s;s of life, by which the human &s;pecies is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other parts of the ani|mal creation. Con&s;ider his &s;ituation as a can|didate for an eternal exi&s;tence; view him as nece&s;&s;arily ignorant of every principle of that religion, through the happy influence of which alone the degenerate race of Adam can rati|onally form the mo&s;t di&s;tant expectation of fu|ture
<PB N="26" REF="012917_0025_0F8E6E529D66C778">felicity. View him moreover in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, a &s;lavery of the wor&s;t kind, a &s;lavery of all others mo&s;t de|&s;tructive of human happine&s;s,&mdash;an entire &s;ub|jection to the tyrannizing power of lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;wholly devoted to the governing in|fluence of tho&s;e irregular propen&s;ities, which are the genuine offspring of depraved nature, when una&s;&s;i&s;ted by philo&s;ophy or religion. Behold him actually clothed in all that brutal &s;tupidity, that &s;avage barbarity which natural|ly &s;prings from &s;uch a &s;ource. Add to this, his condition of perpetual in&s;ecurity, ari&s;ing from the &s;tate of ho&s;tility and war that forever rages in tho&s;e inho&s;pitable climes; and con|&s;ider the treatment he is to expect, whom the fortune of war has &s;ubjected to the power of his enraged foe, who&s;e natural cruelty is per|petually &s;harpened, and who&s;e de&s;ire of re|venge is continually cheri&s;hed, by a &s;en&s;e of his own danger. Reflect, I &s;ay, a moment upon the condition of a creature in human &s;hape, (for in &s;uch a &s;tate of degradation one can hardly call him a man) the mi&s;ery, the wretch|edne&s;s of who&s;e &s;ituation is by the&s;e expre&s;&s;i|ons but faintly repre&s;ented; and compare it with the condition of a &s;lave in this country; and then &s;ee if you can he&s;itate one moment
<PB N="27" REF="012917_0026_0F8E6E5382C6E448">which of the two is mo&s;t eligible. If perad|venture a doubt &s;hould ari&s;e, if you will plea&s;e to enquire, whether you would rather choo&s;e one, for who&s;e pro&s;perity you was tenderly concerned, &s;hould be educated in <HI>Africa,</HI> with all the immunities of a native <HI>African,</HI> or in this country, though in that &s;tate of &s;ubordi|nation, to which <HI>Africans</HI> are here &s;ubjected, I will venture to warrant you of every &s;uch doubt a &s;peedy re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Here then I re&s;t the argument, for upon this point the pre&s;ent que&s;tion mu&s;t infallibly determine. Notwith&s;tanding all the unea&s;i|ne&s;s attending &s;ubordination, and all the mi|&s;eries to which an <HI>African</HI> is expo&s;ed in his removal from his native country; while his condition here is &s;o much more eligible than his condition there, his removal is to be e&s;|teemed a favor: And the con&s;titution of our government, whereby &s;uch removal is counte|nanced and encouraged, is by no means to be e&s;teemed reprehen&s;ible. It is in vain to al|ledge here the want of con&s;ent on his part. It is evident from the rea&s;oning above, that con|&s;ent, in order to &s;ubjection, is nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e ca&s;es only where the end of authority, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good, cannot be promoted
<PB N="28" REF="012917_0027_0F8E6E541ABD5640">without it: But who I be&s;eech you, ever thought the con&s;ent of a child, an ideot, or a madman nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ubordination? Every whit as immaterial is the con&s;ent of the&s;e mi&s;erable <HI>Africans,</HI> who&s;e real character &s;eems to be a compound of the three la&s;t mentioned. What can avail his con&s;ent, who through ig|norance of the means nece&s;&s;ary to promote his happine&s;s, is rendered altogether incapable of choo&s;ing for him&s;elf? And as the con&s;ent of &s;uch a being could by no means involve &s;ubordination in a ca&s;e where it would be otherwi&s;e improper, &s;o the want of it can be no bar in a ca&s;e where it would not. In all &s;uch ca&s;es it is undoubtedly the duty of tho&s;e, whom providence has favored with the means of improvement in under&s;tanding, and the wi&s;dom re&s;ulting from &s;uch improvement, to make u&s;e of their di&s;cretion in directing the conduct of tho&s;e who want it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that I have already dwelt too long upon this argument; you will however in this connexion, permit me to add, that were involuntary &s;ubjection, in all ca&s;es, contrary to the law of nature, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Governor of the univer&s;e, who&s;e wi&s;|dom is infinite, and who&s;e will is eternally
<PB N="29" REF="012917_0028_0F8E6E54D87FE190">and immutably coincident with, and <HI>when re|vealed to us,</HI> the <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of, this law, &s;hould ever have expre&s;sly tolerated it in any parti|cular in&s;tance. I mention this in the pre&s;ent connexion, the rather becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e the authority, the I&s;raelites, when under a govern|ment ab&s;olutely theocratical, were permitted to exerci&s;e over &s;trangers, was founded in the &s;ame rea&s;on with the authority, for which I con|tend, viz: that it was better for them to re&s;ide among a people, where they might have &s;ome opportunity for improvement in knowledge and virtue, though in a &s;tate of &s;ubordination, than to remain among&s;t the barbarous and i|dolatrous nations, whence they originated.</P>
<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary or expedient, it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, by compari&s;on, in a great variety of in&s;tances not mentioned, the &s;uperiority of a &s;lave in this country, in point of condition, to a natural inhabitant of <HI>Africa.</HI> And though it be too true, that the&s;e unhappy creatures are, in many particular ca&s;es, cruelly treated, yet, while their importation is to them a redemption from a condition on the whole &s;o much more mi&s;erable, we mu&s;t, as I &s;aid before, ju&s;tify the government in tolera|ting &s;uch importation; and with regard to
<PB N="30" REF="012917_0029_0F8E6E55AB79BAF0">the particular in&s;tances of abu&s;e, we can only &s;ay <HI>caveant qui &s;unt con&s;cii.</HI></P>
<P>I have omitted the right, &s;ometimes pre|tended to be derived from purcha&s;e, becau&s;e I look upon the argument to be trifling. For though right of authority, if it be well found|ed, be po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome ca&s;es, transferable, yet it is well known, that all the authority any one of the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures can pretend to over another, is founded merely in the for|tune of a brutal, &s;avage war, conducted with|out the le&s;t regard, on either &s;ide, to any principles of equity, ju&s;tice, or national honor; and for the right of authority &s;o founded I have no di&s;po&s;ition to contend. But I think there is much more in their argument who contend that, by the purcha&s;e of the&s;e vic|tims, their lives are pre&s;erved, which would otherwi&s;e undoubtedly be &s;acrificed to the cruelty of the captors. For though I am &s;en|&s;ible, that to this is commonly replied, that the cu&s;tom of purcha&s;ing captives is a perpe|tual &s;ource of war; yet if we con&s;ider that a people, &s;o inhumanly &s;avage as to di&s;po&s;e of their neare&s;t relations for baubles, can never want matter of di&s;cord; and that, was it not for the advantages in this way made of them,
<PB N="31" REF="012917_0030_0F8E6E566F834CB0">the captives would generally peri&s;h, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to doubt whether the cu&s;tom of purcha&s;ing may in this way be con&s;idered as a favor.</P>
<P>On the whole, &s;ince it is evident beyond all controver&s;y, that the removal of the <HI>Africans,</HI> from the &s;tate of brutality, wretchedne&s;s, and mi&s;ery, in which they are at home to deeply involved, to this land of light, humanity, and chri&s;tian knowledge, is to them &s;o great a ble&s;|&s;ing; however faulty any individuals may have been in point of unnece&s;&s;ary cruelty, practi&s;ed in this bu&s;ine&s;s; yet, whether the general &s;tate of &s;ubordination here, which is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their removal, be a|greable to the law of nature, can by no means longer remain a que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all you have &s;o ingeni|ou&s;ly alledged in &s;upport of this que&s;tion, I am &s;till obliged to confe&s;s my&s;elf one of tho&s;e in whom your rea&s;oning has failed to produce conviction: And mu&s;t be excu&s;ed in &s;aying that the ju&s;tice of &s;lavery <HI>generally</HI> under&s;tood, is &s;till, for aught I am able to di&s;cern, far from being &s;upported.&mdash;It is true the I&s;raelites
<PB N="32" REF="012917_0031_0F8E6E57181E2220">when under a theocratical government were permitted, under certain circum&s;tances, to ex|erci&s;e authority over &s;trangers re&s;ident among them. And this is adduced as an argument, infallibly conclu&s;ive in favor of &s;lavery. But is it certain that this conclu&s;ion is not drawn a little too ha&s;tily?</P>
<P>The Governor of the univer&s;e has, in a cer|tain in&s;tance, expre&s;sly tolerated &s;lavery, No|thing was ever by him tolerated but what was agreeable to the law of nature. Therefore,&mdash;Slavery is lawful. The man mu&s;t have a very extraordinary talent who can de|duce this conclu&s;ion from &s;uch premi&s;es.&mdash; It is readily granted, that thus much may be ju&s;tly inferred from them, viz. that &s;uch a particular connexion of things <HI>once</HI> took place, as rendered &s;lavery, under the <HI>expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the Governor of the univer&s;e, lawful. But will it follow from hence, that &s;lavery is ever lawful <HI>without &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion?</HI> As well may we infer a right, by the law of nature, to put any who are unable to re&s;i&s;t our power, under harrows and axes of iron, and in a word, make the <HI>particular</HI> precept in any ca&s;e, given the <HI>I&s;rae|lites,</HI> a mea&s;ure, whereby to explain tho&s;e <HI>general</HI> laws of nature, which are to regulate the con|duct
<PB N="33" REF="012917_0032_0F8E6E5B3186D158">of <HI>all mankind.</HI> It is undoubtedly true, that every expre&s;s declaration of the Governor of the univer&s;e is agreeable to, and ju&s;tly ex|planatory of, the law of nature, as far as &s;uch declaration extends: And the conduct of any particular per&s;on, or people, which is agree|able to &s;uch declaration is mo&s;t certainly right; but it can never be certainly inferred from hence, that a like conduct in others, not hav|ing the &s;ame warrant, is agreeable to this law: For the imperfection of human wi&s;dom ren|ders it forever uncertain, whether the ca&s;es are in all re&s;pects &s;imilar; and con&s;equently, it can never be <HI>certainly</HI> determined, that the &s;ame conduct will, in both ca&s;es, have the &s;ame natural tendency to happine&s;s; and hence the &s;ame conduct, that in the former ca&s;e was right, <HI>may</HI> in the latter, be wrong. But could even this be a&s;certained, there would &s;till re|main an in&s;uperable difficulty in determining the actions of one people to be right, <HI>merely</HI> from an expre&s;s toleration of the &s;ame, or like ac|tions in another: And this ari&s;es <HI>&s;olely</HI> from the <HI>want</HI> of &s;uch toleration. If it be objected, that an action, in it's nature unfit, could not be tolerated; it may be an&s;wered, that the &s;ame action, <HI>when &s;o expre&s;sly</HI> authori&s;ed, may be fit and proper, and in it's nature right,
<PB N="34" REF="012917_0033_0F8E6E5C3A24EB10">which <HI>without &s;uch toleration,</HI> would not be &s;o; and for this plain rea&s;on, that the &s;ame action, when by rightful authority permitted, may have on the whole a tendency to happi|ne&s;s, which without &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion, would have an oppo&s;ite tendency.</P>
<P>If this rea&s;oning be ju&s;t (the validity of which, I am happily too well acquainted with your knowledge of the principles of argumen|tation, to doubt whether you will di&s;pute) how far the lawfulne&s;s of the practice of &s;lave|ry among the I&s;raelites, when expre&s;sly tolera|ted by the Governor of the univer&s;e, will ju&s;ti|fy a people in a like practice, to whom no &s;uch toleration has ever been granted, is by no means difficult to di&s;cern. And before the principle of natural equality can be over|thrown, the tendency of &s;lavery to the good of mankind, mu&s;t, by arguments drawn from <HI>the nature and con&s;titution of things,</HI> be made <HI>evidently</HI> to appear.</P>
<P>I have no di&s;po&s;ition to contend for the &s;upport of principles not founded in &s;ufficient rea&s;on; was I convinced, that the principle of natural equality, <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> under&s;tood, was
<PB N="35" REF="012917_0034_0F8E6E5CE8DB0BA0">not founded in the general good of mankind, notwith&s;tanding the con&s;ent of philo&s;ophers in all ages, I would readily give it up. And was I per&s;uaded, that the practice of en&s;laving <HI>Africans,</HI> as tolerated in this province, was con&s;onant to this end. I &s;hould no longer doubt of it's propriety: But unhappily for my apprehen&s;ion this is far from being the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Was it po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider this ca&s;e as &s;tanding alone, independent of it's connexions with practices of a like kind in other places, and the more exten&s;ive influence it may con&s;e|quently have upon the happine&s;s of mankind, it is at lea&s;t doubtful if it would then be right. I am ready to allow, that was it <HI>certain</HI> that their condition here is happier on the whole, than in their own country, your premi&s;es, in this <HI>independent view</HI> of the matter, would well warrant your conclu&s;ion; but even this I ap|prehend is far from being true. You have re|pre&s;ented the mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s of the&s;e people in their native land, in a light indeed di&s;agreeable enough: But I am &s;till di&s;po&s;ed from my apprehen&s;ion of the dignity of the rational nature, at lea&s;t to hope that your co|louring is a little too &s;trong; and that not|with&s;tanding

<P>Smith, &s;peaking of their government, ob&s;erves, <Q>That the gold coa&s;ts and &s;lave coa&s;ts are divided into &s;everal di&s;tricts, &s;ome of which are governed by their chiefs or kings; the other being more of the nature of a commonwealth, are governed by &s;ome of the principal men, who, Bo&s;man &s;ays, are properly denominated civil fathers; who&s;e province it is to take care of the welfare of the city or village, and to prevent tumults.</Q> Smith 193.</P>
<P>In A&s;tley's collections it is remarked, as an excellency in the Guinea government, <Q>That however poor, they may be in general, yet they have no beggars there.
