<P><HI>THe Scriptures of Truth do not only clearly deliver to, and plainly teach us the Dortrine of a</HI> Future State; <HI>That we must Exi&s;t, and Live after this</HI> Mortal Life <HI>Expires; in our Souls</HI> Separatim, <HI>immediately upon our Di&s;&s;olution, as Written in</HI> Eccl. 3.21.

<HEAD><HI>Spiritual Anatomizing:</HI> OR, Characteri&s;tical Notes of a Godly State Propos'd, In the Ten following Heads of Queries.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">As Introductory whereto 'tis briefly Offer'd in Five A&s;&s;ertions. <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I. A&s;&s;er.</HI> THAT <HI>Self Examination</HI> is a plain Go&s;|pel Duty, urged on all the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; in 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your &s;elves whether ye be in the Faith:</HI> [that is] Search and Try, Whether ye be True Chri&s;tians, or no: For Faith that is Evange|lical, is our Spiritual Life: 1 Joh. 5.1. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God;</HI> and gives the Sub|jects of it a ju&s;t claime to that Honourable and Di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Character. Whence, 'tis Evident, That the At|tendance of this Duty of Self Tryal gives not the <HI>Being,</HI> tho' it may prove an happy Occa&s;ion of it, but is truly Nece&s;&s;ary for the Well Being, Comfort and Serenity of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The Precept here recommended and pre&s;&s;ing it, is ge|neral; it Reaches and Affects <HI>all Men</HI> under the Go&s;pel: Both Good and Bad are concern'd therein: Gal. 6.4. <HI>Let every Man prove his own Work, and then &s;hall he have rejoycing in him&s;elf alone, and not in another.</HI> And not only Duty to God obliges them; but <HI>Self Intere&s;t</HI> &s;teps in and lays an indefeazible claim thereto. Self Tryal is a Debt to both God, and our Selves; and can we be &s;o Unju&s;t, and Un|rea&s;onable, as to forget, and neglect it, when the paying
<PB N="2" REF="001661_0006_0FB4D90885B3BB68">it may every way prove our Benefit and Advantage? For hereby we may <HI>Anatomize our Souls,</HI> Unveil their State, and &s;o Di&s;cover, bring to Light, and take a Pro&s;pect of the Truth of Grace; or its Counterfeit in us. It will give us &s;ome Satisfying, if not undeniable Evidence, What our E&s;tate is before the All-&s;eeing, and Heart|&s;earching God: Jer. 17.10. Heb. 4.13. &mdash; Whe|ther we have ever been born of God, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.3. And &s;o are become <HI>New Creatures,</HI> or no? &mdash; Whether we have the Graces of the Spirit infus'd, and implanted in our Souls, or not? Even tho&s;e better things, as, <HI>Faith, Repentance, Love,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That accompany Salvation,</HI> Heb. 6.9.</P>
<P>Whence, we &s;hall be able to make a right judg|ment of our Spiritual State, How the ca&s;e &s;tands with us before the Holy GOD; and &s;o having &s;et things in a true and clear Light, may have the Advantage of Rectifying all Previous Mi&s;takes of our Selves, if any be, Whether re&s;ulting from a Criminal Neglect of, or Inadvertency in the Attendance of this Duty; and thereby prevent what otherwi&s;e might prove of Fatal Con&s;equence: <HI>For</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Gal. 6.3.) <HI>if a Man think him&s;elf to be &s;omething, when he is Nothing, he Deceiveth him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. A&s;&s;er.</HI> That this Tryal of our Selves mu&s;t be In|ten&s;e, Serious, Searching, Particular and Impartial: in|timated by the Apo&s;tle in the next Paragragh of fore|cited, 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Prove your own Selves.</HI> A Phra&s;e very &s;ignificant, and expre&s;&s;ive; both dictating the manner, How we &s;hou'd perform it, and pointing us to the Rule we mu&s;t ob&s;erve therein. As tho' it had been &s;aid, See that ye do it &s;o, as will be to Effect; Attend that ratio|nal Method, and tho&s;e likely Mea&s;ures &s;quare your Selves by, That will bring all to a Narrow, and fully re&s;olve you of your Ca&s;e. The work is Great, and Weighty, both in it &s;elf, Tendency and Con&s;equents, and there|fore mu&s;t be gone about regularly, with utmo&s;t Care and Diligence. The Nature of it is Spiritual and nearly Concerns a future Life, to the rendring which gloriou&s;ly happy, we mu&s;t diligently in&s;pect, and carefully cor|rect
<PB N="3" REF="001661_0007_0FB4D90A083009F0">our pre&s;ent State. We mu&s;t attend it with fervour and zeal; Yea, with the Clo&s;e&s;t Application, and In|ten&s;ene&s;s of Mind, that's po&s;&s;ible; Whereby we &s;hall but con&s;ult our Comfort and Happine&s;s, and u&s;e One good Medium to our Chearful Per&s;evering in Grace, &s;hou'd we find the Root of the Matter in us, <HI>Job</HI> 19.38.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be &s;trict, &s;evere and thorough in this our Search; Admit of no Diver&s;ion, &s;top, or remora what|ever, but be fix't, and re&s;olute therein, le&s;t Satan our common avow'd Enemy, and our deceitful and de&s;pe|rately Wicked Hearts, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.9. do from their Aver|&s;ion to the Duty hurry us along, and precipitately throw us into fatal Mi&s;takes, that might urge our building on a Sandy foundation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, We mu&s;t not content our Selves with a Try|al of our State in Gro&s;s, but be very Curious, Critical, and Exact therein: Attend it <HI>Gradatim,</HI> by &s;teps, taking every thing in Cour&s;e, Viewing them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and well: Ever having in our Eye the <HI>New Creature</HI> in all its fine Parts, and charming Features, by which we mu&s;t Compare our Selves, if we mean to make a true di&s;covery of our State.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t beware, we Omit nothing E&s;&s;ential in our Tryal, nor are wanting in our particular Per&s;onal Applications therein. We &s;hou'd Ask our Selves all Pertinent Que&s;tions, and Summons Con&s;cience to An&s;wer them in Order, and Wait unwilling to pa&s;s any over un|re&s;olv'd: Gal. 6.7. <HI>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III. A&s;&s;er.</HI> That we mu&s;t be conformable to the <HI>Word of God;</HI> that Written Declaration of the Divine Will, which nece&s;&s;arily is our Rule therein: for therein only is the Natural Man decipher'd and drawn in his true&s;t Colours to us: As in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, 8. So <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10. <HI>to</HI> 18. inclu&s;ive; and in <HI>ver.</HI> 23. All have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God, Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> Children of Di&s;obedience; fulfilling the Will of the Fle&s;h, and of the Mind; conformable to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the
<PB N="4" REF="001661_0008_0FB4D90C463DFDF0">Spirit that rules them; Naturally Children of Wrath' 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>New Creature</HI> is likewi&s;e there, and no where el&s;e livelily repre&s;ented, and with a &s;pi|ritual Air delineated: Thus, 2 Cor. 5.17, 21. <HI>The New Creature is in Chri&s;t; Old things are pa&s;t away, all things are become New. He is made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Chri&s;t.</HI> Eph. 4.24. <HI>The New Man is after God created in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> Col. 3.10. <HI>Renewed in Knowledge af|ter the Image of Him that created him.</HI> So 1 Joh. 1.4, 12, 18, 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Gods Written Word is the only Gla&s;s, wherein we may take a View of their re&s;pective Com|plexions, and &s;ee how they &s;tand in direct Oppo&s;ition each to Other; and are not only of quite different Make and Shape, but of irreconcilable Tempers.</P>
<P>The true Character of One, as Pourtray'd in the Scrip|tures of Truth is, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> the Rever&s;e, in truth the Contradiction of the Other. This Divine Line, is what we only may mea&s;ure our &s;elves by, the &s;tretch whereof mu&s;t be our Boundary, whence we may obtain a full Re&s;olution, and fetch a final An&s;wer. It is a more &s;ure Word of Prophe&s;y, <HI>Whereunto</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>we do well, that we take heed, as unto a Light that &s;hineth in a dark place,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19.</P>

This then is an happy Effect of the Spirits Office, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.8, 9, 10, 11. Are we hence become Unea&s;y under the Yoke of Sin? Are we weary of its Tyranny? and &s;o made willing to part with it? Do we &s;ee and judge our Selves mi&s;erable, whil&s;t under the Power of, and Acted by Sin? And are we truly de&s;irous of a Remedy? <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.3. &mdash; Have we a Spiritual Palate? Do we reli&s;h the Heavenly Manna?

They that are after the Spirit, or become Spiritual, Mind the things of the Spirit. Do we live Mortify'd Lives? Do we not pamper the Fle&s;h? and indulge our car|nal Lu&s;ts? but do we what we can, Strive again&s;t and oppo&s;e the corrupt Dictates of our Natures?

Are we in the Gene|ral cour&s;e of our Lives under the Divine Conduct of it? Be we guided thereby in the Way of Truth? <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.13. Does it lead us in the Paths of the Lords Precepts?

Do we Supplicate in the Spirit? And Pray with true Devotion of Soul? Are we Fervent, Zealous and Sincere in our Religious Addre&s;&s;es unto God? Do our Hearts go with our Mouths? Do we truly de&s;ire the Good we ask for? Do we find the Spirit of Grace breathing in us in our breathings up unto God? <HI>Ver.</HI> 26. Do we ta&s;te the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit? <HI>Ver.</HI> 23. &mdash; Does the Spirit witne&s;s to us for our Comfort? As that we are Pardoned Ones? That we are the Adopted of God? And the Sanctify'd in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? <HI>Ver.</HI> 15, 16. So 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. Helping us with an holy Filial Confidence to cry, <HI>Abba Father, Gal.</HI> 4.6. Have we therein &s;weet intimate Conver&s;e, and endearing fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t, and God the Father, thro' him? Tis Written, 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Have we any ravi&s;hing Interviews with Hea|ven? &mdash; Do we Anticipate the Joys above? And does this Wing, and Enlarge our De&s;ires to nearer Approaches? To more Open Views, and fairer Pro&s;|pects? And does this Serve to take us off from the Vanities of Time, and Sen&s;e; and to &s;et us a long|ing for the immediate Enjoyments of God, and Glory? If &s;o we have the Earne&s;t of our Inheritance until the Redemption of the Purcha&s;ed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the Prai&s;e of the Glory of Chri&s;t, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.14.

<P>This is an Undoubted Evidence.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. Rule.</HI> Do we Unfeignedly Believe on Chri&s;t? Do we heartily Credit the Report given of Him in the Scriptures of Truth?

As Prie&s;t to A|tone for, and Reconcile us to God? And as our King to Reign in, Rule over, and Govern us according to his Will, and to Re&s;train, and Subdue our Spiritual Enemies for us? Do we rowl, and ca&s;t our Selves on Him, as an only Saviour? <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. Our only Atone|ment, that Infinite Wi&s;dom hath provided? <HI>Prov.</HI> 33.24. Can we leave our All with Him? Con&s;ecrating, and Devoting our All unto Him? 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. Is this, tho' faint, yet the true de&s;ires, and attempts of our Souls? Are their Out-goings, tho' weak, yet only after Him? Did we ever di&s;cern any real, and di&s;tingui&s;hing Ex|cellency in Chri&s;t? Had we ever &s;uch a realizing View of his Form, Comeline&s;s, and Beauty, as did carry Out, and Enlarge our De&s;ires after Him? &mdash; Did we ever &s;o Apprehend them, as rendred Him Lovely, yea altogether Lovely in our Eyes? <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.16. The truly, and only de&s;ireable One of our Souls? To be the <HI>Ro&s;e of Sharon, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Valleys?</HI> Cant. 2.1. Infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ing a <HI>Solomon</HI> in his mo&s;t Splendid Appearances of Royalty and Glory; &mdash;Is Chri&s;t be|come Precious to our Souls? Thus He is to true Believers on Him, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. Are our Hearts &s;et upon Him? Are our Thoughts mo&s;t an end going out after Him? Are our Minds frequently Engag'd in a &s;weet, if not a ravi&s;hing Contemplating on Him? Do we look upon Him, <HI>as the Power of God, and the
<PB N="10" REF="001661_0014_0FB4D91906331110">Wi&s;dom of God?</HI> 1 Cor. 1.24. Do we labour to Sup|pre&s;s Vain Thoughts? And in no wi&s;e cheri&s;h and indulge them? We have then a glorious Title to the Beatifick Vi&s;ion, <HI>Math.</HI> 5.8. Do we de&s;ign, and accordingly, as we can, Apply our Selves to Oppo&s;e &s;uch Sinful Ebullitions of Heart? To check, and &s;tifle Sin in its fir&s;t Motions, and Stirrings therein? Do we thus make it our bu&s;ine&s;s to Purify our Hearts? So indeed do Believers on Chri&s;t: Acts 15.9. <HI>Purifying their Hearts by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>We then do believe in Chri&s;t, and have a Faith, of the right Kind; &s;uch a Faith, as is Operative, and Sa|ving, A Faith, that always works by Love, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. The End of which, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.9. Is the Salvation of the Soul.</P>
<P>This is a Sure Token.</P>
<P><HI>III. Rule.</HI> Is it our real De&s;ire, our Sincere, and Main Endeavour to be Intere&s;ted in the Favour and Friend&s;hip of Chri&s;t? Do we &s;o E&s;teem, and Appre|tiate the &s;ame, as in Compari&s;on there-with to con|temn and de&s;pi&s;e the Friend&s;hip of the World? Do we not lay out our Selves after the Latter? Or ra|ther do we neglect to &s;ecure it, as being Enmity to God, and Chri&s;t? <HI>James</HI> 4.4. Is the Bent of our In|clinations chiefly, yea, only towards, and do we make a preferring Choice of Chri&s;ts Friend&s;hip? Is it dear to us, as our Lives? And if &s;tanding in Competition there-with, cou'd we not rather Sacrifice them, than willingly &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of that? &mdash; And be we led hence to Value the fellow&s;hip of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Do we prize it above, and prefer it to the fellow&s;hip of any Creature, whether intimate&s;t Friend, or neare&s;t and deare&s;t Relative what ever? <HI>Math.</HI> 10.31. So <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.26. We mu&s;t hate All to that, or we cannot be Chri&s;ts Di&s;ciple. &mdash; Do we walk in All the Ordinances of Chri&s;ts In&s;tituting with &s;incere De&s;ires, and Breathings of Soul, yea with Unce&s;&s;ant Hart-like Pantings after Communion with Him therein? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 42.1. Is the
<PB N="11" REF="001661_0015_0FB4D91CE64A5670">reaching of our Soul, the &s;tretch of our Inclinations therefor? And does the Experience of Chri&s;ts Pre|&s;ence, the Breathings of his Spirit in upon our Souls in Ordinances give a plea&s;ing Satisfaction to us? Does it cau&s;e us to &s;it under his Shadow with great de|light? Do we find his fruit &s;weet unto our Ta&s;te? And his Banner over us to be Love? <HI>Cant.</HI> 2.4. And do &s;uch Di&s;coveries refre&s;h our Minds? Do they re|vive us, tho' we walk in the mid&s;t of outward trou|ble? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 138.7. Do they repleni&s;h, and fill our hearts with holy Joy, and make us to rejoyce more, than in the Increa&s;e of Temporal Comforts? Or greate&s;t Affluence of Worldly Enjoyments? Thus was it with the holy P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4.6, 7. We may then triumph, and &s;ay with him, in P&s;al. 73.25. <HI>Whom have we in Heaven, but thee; and there is none upon Earth, that we de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> Ver. 26. <HI>God is the Strength of our Hearts, and our Portion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Comfortable and Sure Sign.</P>
<P><HI>IV. Rule.</HI> Are we true Penitents before God? Have we ever &s;een the Evil of Sin? How contrary to the pure Nature, and holy Will of God it is? How de&s;tructive to the Nature, Comfort, and Happine&s;s of Man it proves? And is it thence become di&s;ta&s;tful to us? Yea is it rendred Odious in our Eyes? &mdash; Do we Own and Acknowledge our Selves Sinners by Nature? Under Original Guilt before God, which binds us over to Eternal Death? <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. And do we Mourn therefor? Are we Sorry for our Per&s;onal Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions? Do we with true Compunction of Soul bewaile them unto God? Do we grieve for our heart &s;ins, as well as our Life &s;ins? For our Inward, and Overt Acts of Obliquity, and Rebellion? As &s;inful Thoughts, as well as &s;inful Words, and Actions? For the Com|mandment is Exceeding broad, reaching both the In|ner, and Outward Man, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.96. Is Sin, as Sin, <HI>[i. e.]</HI> as 'tis an Offence to the Holy God, hateful to us? Can we &s;ay, We have a real Aver&s;ion to it, as
<PB N="12" REF="001661_0016_0FB4D91F06F0BBC0">&s;uch? Do we hate Sin with a perfect hatred? Is it our burden? Chri&s;t then Invites us with a Promi&s;e of Relief, and Ea&s;e, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28. Do we grieve, that we can grieve no more for Sin? Do we make it the Mat|ter of our greate&s;t Complaint at the Throne of Grace in our Prayers unto God? &mdash; Is it our trouble&s;ome Companion? Our continual, con&s;tant Affliction, yea our greate&s;t, and carried as &s;uch in our Addre&s;&s;es unto God? Do we groan to be deliver'd from this Body of Death? And deem, and call our Selves Wretched, till we be? <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. Do we treat Sin, as our Foe? and wor&s;t Enemy? Do we knowingly, and willingly indulge no Sin? Do we, what we can, ab&s;tain from our Own Iniquities? Our Con&s;titution, and Complexion Sins? Do we Endeavour to lay a&s;ide the Sin, that Ea&s;ily be&s;ets us? Our re&s;pective Natures lead, and prompt us to? <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. And, as we can, do we at all times turn from it? Shunning all Ways of Sin? All fore&s;een Temptations thereto? Yea, and do we avoid, what in us lies, all Appearances, and &s;eeming Occa&s;i|ons of Sinning? 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 5.22. &mdash; We have then a Sound Repentance, the fruit of a Godly Sorrow for Sin, which will prove to Salvation, not to be repented of, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.12. <HI>If the wicked for&s;ake his Way, and the Unrighteous his Thoughts, and return unto the Lord,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.7. <HI>He will have Mercy on him, and abundantly Pardon him.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Clear Evidence.</P>
<P><HI>V. Rule.</HI> Be we Loyal Subjects of GOD, the King of Heaven? Do we E&s;teem His Commandments to be Holy, Ju&s;t and Good, and concerning all things to be Right? <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. Do we make his Will revealed in His Word the Rule, and Mea&s;ure of all our Acti|ons? Do we de&s;ignedly Square them by Chri&s;ts Go&s;pel Rules? Do we willingly take Chri&s;t for our Lord, and Serve Him accordingly? <HI>Luke</HI> 4.8. Are we as willing Chri&s;t &s;hou'd Rule and Govern us, as Reconcile us to God, and Save us? Do we Receive Him upon the Terms of the Go&s;pel, as Prophet, Prie&s;t and King?
<PB N="13" REF="001661_0017_0FB4D92086EDE530">Do we with de&s;igned Chearfulne&s;s Submit unto His Roy|al Scepter? Are both his Precepts and Examples, 1 Pet. 2.21. the matter of our Imitation and Practice? Is a Conformity thereto in the Progre&s;&s;ive Cour&s;e of our Lives, endeavoured after by us? Do we labour, that our Obedi|ence does con&s;i&s;t therein? Have we a re&s;pect unto all His Commandments? <HI>So &s;hall we be void of &s;hame before Him,</HI> P&s;al. 119.6. And if <HI>our Hearts Condemn us not, we have then Confidence towards God,</HI> 1 John 3.21. Do we Wor&s;hip Chri&s;t in the Manner He pre&s;cribeth, approving of His Wi&s;dom therein? Do we attend on all His Ordinances, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ibly we can; whether of a publick, or of a more private Nature? Otherwi&s;e we &s;hall fall under Chri&s;t's &s;harp Reproof, and &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ure, in Luke 6.46. <HI>And why call ye Me, LORD, LORD, and do not the things that I &s;ay.</HI> Is our Care Exercis'd in neglecting no known Duty, either to God, or our Fellow Creatures, tho' never &s;o cro&s;s to our corrupt Di&s;po&s;itions of Na|ture, or evil Inclinations thereof?

And become liable to undergo the greate&s;t of Temporal Sufferings therefor? Do we thus, as Occa&s;ion calls for it, <HI>Deny our</HI> Natural <HI>Selves, take up our Cro&s;s, and follow Chri&s;t?</HI> Matth. 16.24. Have we an Holy Ambition in us of blamele&s;sly Walking in the Commandments, and Ordi|nances of the Lord, with them in Luk. 1.2. and &s;o of being Righteous before God? Chri&s;t is then ours to Save us for ever: 'Tis Written, Heb 5.9. <HI>He being made Per|fect, became the Authour of Eternal Salvation to all them that Obey Him.</HI></P>
<P>A Full, and Satisfying Token.</P>
<P><HI>VI. Rule.</HI> Have we a true Love to the Godly? Have we an Hearty Affection for the Saints in the Earth? Do we account &s;uch as bear Chri&s;t's Image, and are careful|ly conforming to His Pattern and Precepts, the truly Excellent Ones? Prov. 12.26. Do we Affect their Society?
<PB N="14" REF="001661_0018_0FB4D92206A439D0">Do we frequent their Company? Thus did the P&s;almi&s;t, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> Example is recorded for our Imitation, P&s;al. 119.63. <HI>I am</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>a Companion of all them that fear Thee, of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> And is all our Delight in them? Do we really take Plea&s;ure in them? Is their Conver&s;ation Plea&s;ing and agreeable to us? Thus was it with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 16.3. Do we the rather do good to &s;uch? Do we even &s;eek for Op|portunities to do the be&s;t Offices we can for them? Are we in waiting Po&s;tures to Serve them? And do we chearfully Embrace Opportunities when they offer? Are we ready to Comfort, Relieve, and Help them, as their Need, and our knowledge thereof calls for? 'Tis Writ|ten in Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have therefore Opportunity, Let us do Good to all Men, e&s;pecially unto them who are of the Hou&s;e|hold of Faith.</HI> Do we make the &s;everal Conditions of the People of God, the re&s;pective Ca&s;es of the Hou&s;e-hold of Faith, to be even as our own? Do we rejoyce in and at the Flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances of any of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples? Be we likewi&s;e Deeply Affected with the &s;ad Exerci&s;es, and grievous Sufferings of any of them that Fear His Name, and are watchful again&s;t all Iniquity? Agreeable to 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>They that name the Name of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t depart from Iniquity.</HI> &mdash; Do we &s;o Sympathize with them, as to become Afflicted with their Afflictions; and Heartily grieve at the Afflictions of <HI>Jo&s;eph?</HI> Now <HI>he that thus dwells in Love with the Brethren, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> 1 John 4.16. This is a mo&s;t Infallible Mark.</P>
<P>As appears expre&s;ly from 1 Joh. 3.14. <HI>We know</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>we have pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VII. Rule.</HI> Are we of a Reconciling, and Forgiving Spirit? Can we ea&s;ily Overlook Injuries, that are done us? Put up Affronts that are offer'd us? And readily pa&s;s by Offences, when given us by any whom&s;oever? Do we owe &s;uch as wrong us in Body, Name, E&s;tate, or Re|latives, no ill Will? Do we not Maintain and Cheri&s;h a rancour of Spirit at them for it? And in no Wi&s;e in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="001661_0019_0FB4D92439CA4FC0">on OUR HONOUR, as a Motive to Vent it? Do we retain no Grudge again&s;t them therefor? &mdash; And when we &s;peak of the Harm we receiv'd, and the Hurt that is done us by any, have we no evil De&s;ign therein again&s;t them? Is it with no Spirit of Revenge? No &s;uch Ra&s;h De&s;ire of Satisfaction therefor? Nay, not allowedly in a Thought? &mdash; Or is it only offered by us, and mentio|ned, as the Matter of our Grievance? As what nearly Affects and Afflicts us? &mdash; Do we in no Wi&s;e, tho' in our Power, requite 'em with Ill? Do we De&s;ignedly for|bear Injuring them, when we can, either in Name, or Intere&s;t, Directly, or Remotely, in our own Per&s;ons, or by Proxy? 'Tis written, <HI>Avenge not your &s;elves, but give place to Wrath; for Vengeance is mine, I will repay, SAITH THE LORD,</HI> Rom. 12.19. But rather do we return Friend|ly and Religious Offices, Acts of Chri&s;tian Love, and Kindne&s;s to them, as we can? Rom. 12.20. &mdash; Do we in our Prayers to God, &s;incerely ask, that His Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion might move towards them, for their Weak|ne&s;s, or Wilfulne&s;s in Abu&s;ing, or Treating us Illy? Do we therein Petition, and from our Hearts de&s;ire, that the Divine Favour might be &s;hewn them, and God's Mercy be Di&s;play'd and Magnify'd in Forgiving them, tho' they &s;hould pur&s;ue us with their Cur&s;ings, and Spiteful U&s;a|ges? Do we take all Occa&s;ions to Serve them? Do we Embrace every Opportunity convenient to do them what Good we can? &mdash; And tho' we chu&s;e not their Com|pany, nor ever Embrace them as INTIMATES, yet, can we when Occa&s;ionally met, &s;peak Kindly unto them? Do we Treat them Civilly, and Entertain them Heartily, with Chri&s;tian Friend&s;hip? &mdash; This is but according to what Chri&s;t, our LORD and MASTER has taught us, As written in Matth. 5.44. <HI>Love your Enemies, Ble&s;&s; them that Cur&s;e you; Do Good to them that hate you, and Pray for them which De&s;pitefully u&s;e you, and Per&s;ecute you.</HI> This (&s;ays He) will Evidence your being the Children of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 45. &mdash; <HI>If we</HI> thus <HI>Forgive Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, our Heavenly FATHER will al&s;o Forgive us,</HI> Matth. 6.14.

Do we find our Afflictions <HI>Yielding to us the Peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> Heb. 12.10, 11. When we are Exerci&s;ed with pre&s;&s;ing Temptations, and &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Tryals, is this the Happy Fruit thereof, <HI>To Purge away our Iniquity, and take away our Sin?</HI> I&s;a. 27.9. Does it help us to make Advances in Holine&s;s? Do our Lo&s;&s;es, and Cro&s;&s;es make us more Humble and Submi&s;&s;ive unto God? Are we De&s;ignedly Patient under Divine Corrections? Readily &s;aying, as in I Sam. 3.18. <HI>'Tis the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him Good.</HI> And again, Lam. 3.39. <HI>Why doth a Li|ving Man Complain; A Man for the Puni&s;hment of his Sons.</HI> Do we thence Endeavour quietly to bear them? Do we in no Wi&s;e willingly, and allowedly <HI>De&s;pi&s;e the Cha&s;tening of the Lord, nor Faint when we are Rebuked of him?</HI> Prov. 3.11. Do we thus Endure Cha&s;tening, de&s;iring its continuance till we are made Spiritual Gainers by it, rather than its removal only for our Ea&s;e? Do we Learn Obedience thereby, and to be more <HI>in Subjection to the Father of Spi|rits, that we may Live,</HI> Heb. 12.9. Do our Afflictive Ex|erci&s;es wean, and take us off from Creature Tru&s;t, and Dependance? Do we Learn, and &s;ee more of the Uncer|tainty, and Vanity thereof by all? And are we brought thereby to Rowl our &s;elves on God, and to Tru&s;t in Him as our only Satisfying Portion? Hab. 3.17, 18. Are we not led thence to a more Exact Conformity to His Word, that Tran&s;cript of the Divine Will, as the Rule of our

Thus was it with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 119.67. <HI>Before I was Afflicted, I went a&s;tray, but now</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>have I kept thy Word.</HI> And will not this mini&s;ter Comfort &amp; Satisfaction to us? Since God &s;ays, in Rev. 3.19. <HI>As many as I Love, I Rebuke and Cha&s;ten.</HI> So Heb. 12.6. <HI>Whom the Lord Loveth He Cha&s;teneth, and Scourgeth every Son whom He receiveth.</HI> And do we not Rejoyce herein, and &s;ay with the P&s;al|mi&s;t, P&s;al. 119.71. <HI>It is good for us, that we have been Afflicted, that we might Learn Thy Statutes.</HI> Do we hence Encourage our &s;elves in God, and in a way of Go&s;pel Obedience, wait for Him under all, hoping in His Mercy, through Chri&s;t, for His Salvation? Lam. 3.24, 25, 26. Rom. 8.18. <HI>I reckon</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>the Sufferings of this pre&s;ent Time, are not worthy to be Compared with the GLORY, that &s;hall be Revealed in us.</HI> So 2 Cor. 4 17. <HI>Our light Affliction, which is but for a Moment, &s;hall then work for us a far more Exceeding, and Eternal Weight of GLORY.</HI></P>

<P N="10"><HI>X. Rule.</HI> Are we Truly, and Evangelically Holy? Have we an Habit of Holine&s;s in our Hearts, and have we Holy Actions Exhibiting it in Our Lives? Do we Act from Grace Imparted, and Infus'd? from God, and not from Nature? Is the <HI>Love of God,</HI> and Chri&s;t <HI>&s;hed a|broad in our Hearts?</HI> Rom. 5.5. Does that Irre&s;i&s;tably <HI>Constrain us?</HI> 2 Cor. 5.14. Does a Sen&s;e of the Divine Love to us, rai&s;e Grateful Re&s;entments in our Souls? And cares thence to return a Chearful Obedience? Do we find in us a Love to God, and His Wayes? To Chri&s;t, and His Go&s;pel Precepts? And do we delight our &s;elves therein? Does not this then Argue a Divine Principle in us? 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We Love Him, becau&s;e He fir&s;t Loved us.</HI> Is not then our Love to God, a Fruit of His Eternal Love to us? Nay is it not a Clear, and Satis|fying Manife&s;tation of it? &mdash; Do we Act, as under God's Eye? Are we fearful of doing any thing Offen|&s;ive, and Di&s;plea&s;ing to Him? Be we careful in all things not to Grieve Him? But to be Dutiful, and Obliging?
